Abstract 
This article reports some initial results from the collaborative work on converting SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme used in the 
Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus to ISO DA annotation framework, as part of our on-going research on the interoperability of 
standardized linguistic annotations. A qualitative assessment of the conversion between the two annotation schemes was performed to 
verify the applicability of the new ISO standard using authentic transcribed speech. The results show that in addition to a major part of 
the SWBD-DAMSL tag set that can be converted to the ISO DA scheme automatically, some problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags still 
need to be handled manually. We shall report the evaluation of such an application based on the preliminary results from automatic 
mapping via machine learning techniques. The paper will also describe a user-friendly graphical interface that was designed for manual 
manipulation. The paper concludes with discussions and suggestions for future work. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
This article describes the collaborative work on applying 
the newly proposed ISO standard for dialogue act 
annotation to the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) 
Corpus, as part of our on-going effort to promote 
interoperability of standardized linguistic annotations 
with the ultimate goal of developing shared and open 
language resources.  
Dialogue acts (DA) play a key role in the 
interpretation of the communicative behaviour of 
dialogue participants and offer valuable insight into the 
design of human-machine dialogue systems (Bunt et al, 
2010). More recently, the emerging ISO DIS 24617-2 
(2010) standard for dialogue act annotation defines 
dialogue acts as the ?communicative activity of a 
participant in dialogue interpreted as having a certain 
communicative function and semantic content, and 
possibly also having certain functional dependence 
relations, rhetorical relations and feedback dependence 
relations? (p. 3). The semantic content specifies the 
objects, relations, events, etc. that the dialogue act is 
about; the communicative function can be viewed as a 
specification of the way an addressee uses the semantic 
content to update his or her information state when he or 
she understands the corresponding stretch of dialogue. 
Continuing efforts have been made to identify and 
classify the dialogue acts expressed in dialogue utterances 
taking into account the empirically proven 
multifunctionality of utterances, i.e., the fact that 
utterances often express more than one dialogue act (see 
Bunt, 2009 and 2011). In other words, an utterance in 
dialogue typically serves several functions. See Example 
(1) taken from the SWBD-DA Corpus 
(sw_0097_3798.utt). 
 
(1) A: Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, 
funding for AIDS research? Do you? 
B:   Well, uh, uh, that?s something I?ve thought a lot 
about.  
 
With the first utterance, Speaker A performs two 
dialogue acts: he (a) assigns the next turn to the 
participant Michael, and (b) formulates an open question. 
Speaker B, in his response, (a) accepts the turn, (b) stalls 
for time, and (c) answers the question by making a 
statement.  
Our concern in this paper is to explore the 
applicability of the new ISO Standard to the existing 
Switchboard corpus with joint efforts of automatic and 
manual mapping. In the rest of the paper, we shall first 
describe the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) 
Corpus and its annotation scheme (i.e. SWBD-DAMSL). 
We shall then describe the new ISO Standard and explain 
our mapping of SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO DIS 24617-2 
DA tag set. In addition, machine learning techniques are 
employed for automatic DA classification on the basis of 
lexical features to evaluate the application of the new ISO 
DA scheme using authentic transcribed speech. We shall 
then introduce the user interface designed for manual 
mapping and explain the annotation guidelines. Finally, 
the paper will conclude with discussions and suggestions 
for future work.  
2. Corpus Resource 
This study uses the Switchboard Dialog Act (SWBD-DA) 
Corpus as the corpus resource, which is available online 
from the Linguistic Data Consortium 1 . The corpus 
                                                          
1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/

contains 1,155 5-minute conversations2, orthographically 
transcribed in about 1.5 million word tokens. It should be 
noted that the minimal unit of utterances for DA 
annotation in the SWBD Corpus is the so called ?slash 
unit? (Meteer and Taylor, 1995), defined as ?maximally a 
sentence but can be smaller unit? (p. 16), and ?slash-units 
below the sentence level correspond to those parts of the 
narrative which are not sentential but which the annotator 
interprets as complete? (p. 16). See Table 1 for the basic 
statistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus. 
 
Table 1: Basic Statistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus 
 
Altogether, the corpus comprises 223,606 slash-units and 
each is annotated for its communicative function 
according to a set of dialogue acts specified in the 
SWBD-DAMSL scheme (Jurafsky et al, 1997) and 
assigned a DA tag. See Example (2) taken from 
sw_0002_4330.utt, where qy is the DA tag for yes/no 
questions.  
 
(2) qy   A.1 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } does the company 
you work for test for drugs? /   
 
A total of 303 different DA tags are identified throughout 
the corpus, which is different from the total number of 
220 tags mentioned in Jurafsky et al (1997: 3). To ensure 
enough instances for the different DA tags, we also 
conflated the DA tags together with their secondary 
carat-dimensions, and yet we did not use the seven special 
groupings by Jurafsky et al (1997) as we kept them as 
separate DA types (see Section 4 for further explanations). 
In the end, the 303 tags were clustered into 60 different 
individual communicative functions. See Table 2 for the 
basic statistics of the 60 DA clusters.  
According to Table 2, we observe that the 60 DA 
clusters range from 780,570 word tokens for the 
top-ranking statement-non-opinion to only 4 word 
                                                          
2 Past studies (e.g. Stolcke et al, 2000; Jurafsky et al, 
1997; Jurafsky et al, 1998a; Jurafsky et al, 1998b) have 
been focused on only 1115 conversations in the 
SWBD-DA Corpus as the training set. As there is no clear 
description which 40 conversations have been used as the 
testing set or for future use, we use all the 1155 
conversations.   
tokens for you?re-welcome. In Table 2, the Token % 
column lists the relative importance of DA types 
measured as the proportion of the word tokens in the 
SWBD-DA corpus as whole. It can be observed that, as 
yet another example to illustrate the uneven use of DA 
types, statement-opinion accounts for 21.04% of the 
total number of word tokens in the corpus.

see that the top 10 DA types alone account for 93.38% of 
the whole corpus, suggesting again the uneven occurrence 
of DA types in the corpus and hence the disproportional 
use of communication functions in conversational 
discourse.  
It is particularly worth mentioning that 
segment-(multi-utterance) is not really a DA type 
indicating communicative function and yet it is the third 
most frequent DA tag in SWBD-DAMSL.  As a matter of 
fact, the SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme contains 
quite a number of such non-communicative DA tags, such 
as abandoned, and quoted-material. 
3. ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) 
A basic premise of the emerging ISO standard for 
dialogue act annotation, i.e., ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010), is 
that utterances in dialogue are often multifunctional; 
hence the standard supports so-called ?multidimensional 
tagging?, i.e., the tagging of utterances with multiple DA 
tags. It does so in two ways: First of all, it defines nine 
dimensions to which a dialogue act can belong: 
? Task 
? Auto-Feedback 
? Allo-Feedback 
? Turn Management 
? Time Management 
? Discourse Structuring 
? Social Obligations Management 
? Own Communication Management 
? Partner Communication Management 
Secondly, it takes a so-called ?functional segment? as 
the unit in dialogue to be tagged with DA information, 
defined as a ?minimal stretch of communicative behavior 
that has one or more communicative functions? (Bunt et 
al., 2010). A functional segment is allowed to be 
discontinuous, and to overlap with or be included in 
another functional segment. A functional segment may be 
tagged with at most one DA tag for each dimension. 
Another important feature is that an ISO DA tag 
consists not only of a communicative function encoding, 
but also of a dimension indication, with optional attributes 
for representing certainty, conditionality, sentiment, and 
links to other dialogue units expressing semantic, 
rhetorical and feedback relations. 
Thus, two broad differences can be observed between 
SWBD-DAMSL and ISO. The first concerns the 
treatment of the basic unit of analysis. While in 
SWBD-DAMSL this is the slash-unit, ISO DIS 24617-2 
(2010) employs the functional segment, which serves well 
to emphasise the multifunctionality of dialogue utterances. 
An important difference here is that the ISO scheme 
identifies multiple DAs per segment and assigns multiple 
tags via the stand-off annotation mechanism. 
The second difference is that each slash-unit (or 
utterance) in the SWBD-DA Corpus is annotated with one 
SWBD-DAMSL label, while each DA tag in the ISO 
scheme is additionally associated with a dimension tag 
and, when appropriate, with function qualifiers and 
relations to other dialogue units. See the following 
example taken from the Schiphol Corpus. 
 
(3) A: I?m most grateful for your help 
 
While the utterance in Example (3) would be annotated 
with only a functional tag in SWBD-DAMSL, it is 
annotated to contain the communicative function ?inform? 
and in addition the dimension of social obligation 
management:  
 
    communicativeFunction = ?inform? 
  dimension = ?socialObligationManagement? 
4. Mapping SWBD-DAMSL to ISO  
4.1 Data Pre-processing 
For the benefit of the current study and potential 
follow-up work, the banners between folders were 
removed and each slash-unit was extracted to create a set 
of files. See Example (4), the tenth slash-unit taken from 
the file sw_0052_4378.utt in the folder sw00.    
 
(4) sd     B.7 utt1: {C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we?ve  
                             done <sigh> lots to it. /  
 
The following set of files is created: 
 
sw00-0052-0010-B007-01.txt  the original utterance 
sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-S.da  SWBD-DAMSL tag 
 
In the .txt file, there is the original utterance:  
 
     {C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we?ve                             
done <sigh> lots to it. /  
 
While the *-S.da file only contains the DA label: sd^t. 
Still another one or more files (depending on the number 
of dimensions) will be added to this set after converting 
the SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO tag sets.  Take Example (4) 
for instance. Two more files will be created, namely,   
 
sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-0.da  ISO DA tag 
sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-1.da  ISO DA tag 
 
The *-ISO-0.da file will contain in this case:  
 
   communicativeFunction = ?inform? 
   dimension = ?task?3 
 
and the *-ISO-1.da file will contain4:  
 
   communicativeFunction = ?stalling? 
   dimension = ?timeManagement? 
                                                          
3 The same function Inform have been observed to occur 
in different dimensions. See ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) for 
detailed description.  
4 See Section 4.2 for more explanation of the multi-layer 
annotations in ISO standard.

4.2 Assessment of the Conversion 
When mapping SWBD-DAMSL tags to functional ISO 
tags, it is achieved in terms of semantic contents rather 
than the surface labels. To be more exact, four situations 
were identified in the matching process.  
The first is what is named as ?exact matches?. It is 
worth mentioning that since we are not matching the 
labels in the two annotation schemes, even for the exact 
matches, the naming in SWBD-DAMSL is not always the 
same as that in the ISO scheme, but they have the same or 
very similar meaning. Table 3 lists the exact matches.

Table 3: Exact Matches 
It can also be noted that in the previous study on the 42 
DA types in SWBD-DAMSL, open-option (oo), 
offer (co), commit (cc) are treated as one DA type. In 
the current study, they are treated as individual DA types, 
which makes more sense especially when mapping to the 
ISO DA tag sets since each of them corresponds to a 
different ISO tag, suggest, offer, and promise 
respectively.   The same is also true for the 
you?re-welcome (fw) and correct-misspeaking 
(bc), which are combined together in SWBD-DAMSL 
and correspond to different ISO DA label.

Table 4: Many-to-one Matches 
The second situation is where more than one 
SWBD-DAMSL tags can be matched to the one ISO DA 
type, as defined as many-to-one matches. Table 4 shows 
the many-to-one matches. Such matches occur because 
semantically identical functions are sometimes given 
different names in SWBD-DAMSL in order to distinguish 
differences in lexical or syntactic form. For example, an 
affirmative non-yes answer is defined as an 
affirmative answer that does not contain the word yes or 
one of its variants (like yeah and yep). 
 The most complex issue is with the one-to-many 
matches, where a DA function in SWBD-DAMSL is too 
general and corresponds to a set of different DAs in the 
ISO scheme. Consider the DA type of accept in 
SWBD-DAMSL. It is a broad function applicable to a 
range of different situations. For instance, accept 
annotated as aa in Example (5) taken from 
sw_0005_4646.utt corresponds to Agreement in ISO 
DIS 24617-2 (2010). 
 
(5) sd    A.25 utt1: {C Or } people send you there as a  
                                  last resort. / 
     aa     B.26 utt1: Right,  / 
 
However, accept (aa) in Example (6) taken from 
sw_0098_3830.utt actually corresponds to 
acceptOffer in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).  
 
(6) co    B.26 utt1: I can tell you my last job or --/ 
      aa    A.27 utt1: Okay,  / 
 
As a matter of fact, accept in SWBD-DAMSL may 
correspond to several different DAs in the ISO tag set 
such as: 
? Agreement  
? AcceptRequest (addressRequest) 
? AccpetSuggestion (addressSuggestion) 
? AcceptOffer (addressOffer) 
? etc. 
 
Other cases include reject, action-directive and 
other answers.  
Finally, the remaining tags are unique to 
SWBD-DAMSL, including  
 
? quoted material 
? uninterpretable 
? abandoned 
? self-talk 
? 3rd-party-talk 
? double labels  
? explicit-performative  
? exclamation 
? other-forward-function 
 
It is not difficult to notice that 6 out of the 9 DA types 
mainly concern the marking up of other phenomena than 
dialogue acts. The last three unique DA types only 
account for a marginal portion of the whole set, about 
0.03% all together (See Table 2).  
64
In addition, multi-layer annotations of ISO can be 
added to the original markup of SWBD (Meteer and 
Taylor 1995), especially in cases such as Stalling and 
Self-Correction. See Example (7) taken from 
sw_0052_4378.utt. 
 
(7) sd   A.12  utt2 : [ I, + {F uh, } two months ago I ]  
                               went to Massachusetts -- /  
 
According to Meteer and Taylor (1995), the {F ?} is 
used to mark up ?filler? in utterances, which corresponds 
to Stalling in ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010). In addition, the 
markup of [ ? + ?] indicates the repairs (Meteer and 
Taylor, 1995), which suits well the definition of 
Self-correction in the ISO standard. As a result, the 
utterance in Example (7) is thus annotated in three 
dimensions:  
communicativeFunction = ?inform? 
dimension = ?task? 
 
communicativeFunction = ?stalling? 
dimension = ?timeManagement? 
 
communicativeFunction = ?self-correction? 
dimension = ?ownCommManagement? 
4.3 Mapping Principles 
Given the four setting of the matching, there major 
principles were made:  
1) Cases in both ?exact matches? and ?many-to-one 
matches? can be automatically mapped to ISO tags by 
programming. 
2) Tags that are unique to SWBD-DAMSL would not 
be considered at the current stage due to the absence of 
ISO counterparts and their marginal proportion. 
3) Cases in ?one-to-many matches? are more complex 
and call for manual mapping, which will be further 
discussed in Section 6.  
4) Different DA dimensions will be also automatically 
added accordingly to each utterance in the format of 
stand-off annotation.  
5. Application Verification 
To evaluate the applicability of mapping SWBD-DAMSL 
tag set to the new ISO standard (ISO DIS 24617-2, 2010), 
machine learning techniques are employed, based on the 
preliminary results from the automatic mapping, to see 
how well the SWBD-ISO DA tags can be automatically 
identified and classified based on lexical features. The 
result is also compared with that obtained from the 
Top-15 SWBD-DAMSL tags. It will be particularly 
interesting to find out whether the emerging ISO DA 
annotation standard will produce better automatic 
prediction accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate the 
performance of automatic DA classification in the two DA 
annotation schemes by employing the unigrams as the 
feature set.  
Two classification tasks were then identified 
according to the two DA annotation schemes. Task 1 is to 
automatically classify the DA types in the 
SWBD-DAMSL. Based on the observations mentioned 
above, it was decided to use the top 15 DA types to 
investigate the distribution of word types in order to 
ascertain the lexical characteristics of DAs. Furthermore, 
since segment-(multi-utterance), abandoned, and 
quoted-material do not relate to dialogue acts per se, 
these three were replaced with rhetorical-questions, 
open-question and 
affirmative-non-yes-answers. We thus derive 
Table 6 below, showing that the revised list of top 15 DA 
types account for 85.13% of the SWBD corpus. The DA 
types are arranged according to Token% in descending 
order.

Table 6: Top-15 SWBD-DAMSL DA types 
Next, accordingly, task 2 is to classify the top 15 ISO 
DAs based on the results from the automatic mapping. It 
should be pointed out that only one layer of annotation in 
the ISO DA tags is considered in order to make the result 
comparable to that from SWBD-DAMSL, and the 
dimension of task is the priority when it comes to 
multi-layer annotations.

Table 9: Results from Task 2 
Table 9 presents the results for classification task 2. 
The DAs are arranged according to F-score in descending 
order. As can be noted, the weighted average F-score is 
83.1%, over 10% higher than task 1. To be more specific, 
Inform achieves the best F-score of 0.93, followed by 
Answer with an F-score of 0.775. The DA 
InitialGoodbye has the highest precision, of about 
97%, whereas Inform has the highest recall of over 98%. 
Similar to the results obtained in Task 1, the last four types 
of DAs in Task 2 also cannot be classified with the 
F-score of 0%. 
Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, when the data size 
for each DA type is taken into consideration, Task 2 may 
be more challenging than Task 1 in that 6 out of the 15 
SWBD-ISO DA types has a total number of word tokens 
fewer than 4,000 whereas all the 15 SWBD-DAMSL DA 
types has a total number of over 4,000. Therefore, the 
much higher average F-score suggests that the application 
of ISO standard DA scheme could lead to better 
classification performance, suggesting that the ISO DA 
standard represents a better option for automatic DA 
classification. 
To sum up, with a comparable version of the 
SWBD-DA Corpus, results from the automatic DA 
classification tasks show that the ISO DA annotation 
scheme produces better automatic prediction accuracy, 
which encourages the completion of the manual mapping. 
6. Manual Mapping 
6.1 Analysis of Problematic DA Types 
As mentioned earlier, there are mainly four problematic 
SWBD-DAMSL tags, namely, accept (aa), reject 
(ar), action-directive (ad) and other answers 
(no). They are problematic in that they carry a broad 
function applicable to a range of different situations 
according to the new ISO standard, as evidenced in the 
case of accept discussed in Section 4.2. Consequently, to 
map the problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags to the ISO tags 
calls for manual manipulation. 
A close look into those four types shows that the 
mapping could be further divided into two setting. Again, 
take accept (aa) for example. In the first setting, a 
sub-division of accept (aa) can also be automatically 
matched according to the previous utterance by the other 
speaker in the adjacent pair. See Example (8) taken from 
sw_0001_4325.utt.  
 
(8) sv     A.49 utt3: take a long time to find the right  
                                 place / 
      x      A.49 utt4: <laughter>. 
      aa     B.50 utt1: Yeah,  / 
 
Here accept (aa) corresponds to Agreement because of 
the DA type in A.49 utt3 but not the immediate previous 
DA as in A.49 utt4. With this principle, the particular 
sub-groups for automatic mapping were identified for 
accept (aa). See Table 10.

Offer AcceptOffer 
Open-option AcceptRequest 
Thanking AcceptThanking 
Apology AcceptApology 
Table 10: Sub-groups of accept for Auto Mapping 
The remaining cases, in the second setting, call for 
manual annotation. For instance, when the previous DA 
type is also a problematic one, annotators need to decide 
66
the corresponding ISO DA tag for the previous 
SWBD-DAMSL one before converting the accept (aa).  
See Example (9) taken from sw_0423_3325.utt.  
 
(9) ad    B.128 utt2: {C so } we'll just wait. / 
      aa    A.129 utt1: Okay,  / 
 
Here, action-directive (ad) is first decided as a 
suggestion, and therefore accept (aa) turns out to 
actually correspond to acceptSuggestion 
(addressSuggestion) in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).  
6.2 Design of a User Interface 
Given the analysis of those four DA tags, a user-friendly 
interface was then designed to assist annotators to 
maximize the inter-annotator agreement.  See Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1: User Interface 
 
Figure 1 shows the screenshot when the targeted 
SWBD-DAMSL type is accept (aa). As can be noted 
above, the basic functional bars have been designed, 
including: 
? Input: the path of the input 
? Automatch: to filter out the sub-groups that can be 
automatically matched 
? DA Tag: the targeted problematic DAs, namely, 
? aa (accept) 
? ar (reject) 
? ad (action-directive) and 
? no (other answers) 
? Previous: to go back to the previous instance of the 
targeted DA type 
? Next: to move on to the next instance of the targeted 
DA type 
? Current: the extraction of the adjacent turns 
? Previous5T: the extraction of the previous five turns 
when necessary 
? PreviousAll: the extraction of all the previous turns 
when necessary 
? MatchInfo: Bars for mapping information with five 
options: 
? Four pre-defined ISO DA types 
? Other: a user-defined mapping with a 
two-fold function: for user defined ISO DA 
type and for extra pre-defined ISO DA types 
(since the pre-defined DA types differ for 
the four targeted SWBD-DAMSL types).  
? Output: the path of the output 
? Result: export the results to the chosen path 
 
With this computer-aided interface, three annotators are 
invited to carry out the manual mapping. They are all 
postgraduates with linguistic background. After a month 
of training on the understanding of the two annotation 
schemes (in process), they will work on the 
SWBD-DAMSL DA instances from 115 randomly chosen 
files, and map them into ISO DA tags independently. The 
kappa value will be calculated to measure the 
inter-annotator agreement.  
 
7. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we reported our efforts in applying the 
ISO-standardized dialogue act annotations to the 
Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) Corpus. In 
particular, the SWBD-DAMSL tags employed in the 
SWBD-DA Corpus were analyzed and mapped onto the 
ISO DA tag set (ISO DIS 24617-2 2010) according to 
their communicative functions and semantic contents. 
Such a conversion is a collaborative process involving 
both automatic mapping and manual manipulation.  With 
the results from the automatic mapping, machine learning 
techniques were employed to evaluate the applicability of 
the new ISO standard for dialogue act annotation in 
practice. With the encouraging results from the evaluation, 
the manual mapping was carried out. A user-friendly 
interface was designed to assist annotators. The 
immediate future work would be finish the manual 
mapping and thus to  produce a comparable version of the 
SWBD-DA Corpus was produced so that the two 
annotation schemes (i.e. SWBD-DAMSL vs. SWBD-ISO) 
can be effectively compared on the basis of empirical data. 
Furthermore, with the newly built resource, i.e., 
SWBD-ISO, we plan to examine the effect of 
grammatical and syntactic cues on the performance of DA 
classification, with a specific view on whether dialogue 
acts exhibit differentiating preferences for grammatical 
and syntactic constructions that have been overlooked 
before.
