Abstract
We compare four methods for transcribing
early printed texts. Our comparison is through
a case-study of digitizing an eighteenth-
century French novel for a new critical edition:
the 1784 Lettres ta??tiennes by Jose?phine de
Monbart. We provide a detailed error analy-
sis of transcription by optical character recog-
nition (OCR), non-expert humans, and expert
humans and weigh each technique based on
accuracy, speed, cost and the need for schol-
arly overhead. Our findings are relevant to
18th-century French scholars as well as the
entire community of scholars working to pre-
serve, present, and revitalize interest in litera-
ture published before the digital age.
1 Introduction
Preparing a text for modern publication involves the
following: (1) digitizing1 a printed version of the
text, and (2) supplementing the original content with
new scholarly contributions such as a critical intro-
duction, annotations, and a thorough bibliography.
The second task requires a high degree of expertise
and academic insight and the first does not. How-
ever, scholars working on such projects often spend
large amounts of time transcribing literature from
scratch, instead of focusing on skilled contributions.
In this paper, we present an analysis of our efforts
using alternative methods, other than highly skilled
scholars themselves, to transcribe a scanned image
of a novel into a modifiable, searchable document.
We compare four different methods of transcription
with a gold standard and evaluate each for accuracy,
speed, and cost-effectiveness. Choosing an appro-

priate transcription method may save scholars time
and allow them to focus on critical contributions.
First published in 1784, Jose?phine de Monbart?s
Lettres ta??tiennes is an epistolary novel dramatiz-
ing the European colonial takeover of the newly-
encountered island of Tahiti from the fictional point
of view of a young Tahitian woman. While most
works of the time painted a fictional Tahitian par-
adise of uninhibited sexuality, this novel offers a
singular anti-colonial critique by grounding it in the
suffering of the female body. We describe our work
transcribing the second edition of the novel, which is
written in French and was published in Paris, with-
out date (probably 1786). The text is comprised of
156 pages, which are split into two volumes.
There are many off-the-shelf (OTS) natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tools available for French,
including optical character recognition (OCR),
context-sensitive spell checking, and machine trans-
lation. Additionally, French is a widely spoken lan-
guage in the world today and it is often possible to
recruit French speakers to do transcription and an-
notation. However, the early-modern (18th-century)
form of the language varies substantially from the
modern form, which is used to train OTS French
tools and is what non-domain-expert transcribers are
familiar with. Differences between the modern and
early-modern forms of the language include orthog-
raphy, lexical choice, and morphological patterns.
An additional challenge is that our transcriptions
are based on a copied version of the bound text avail-
able at the Bibliothe`que nationale de France. This
common scenario introduces the challenge of noise,
or ink marks which are not part of the text. Scattered
dots of ink may result in punctuation and character
accenting errors, for example.
In this paper, we compare the accuracy, speed, and
64
cost of using several different methods to transcribe
Lettres tahitiennes. In Section 2 we describe the
transcription methods, and in Section 3 we present a
detailed analysis of the types of errors made by each.
We also provide a discussion of the difficulty of
post-editing the output from each transcriber. Sec-
tion 4 gives an overview of prior work in the area and
Section 5 a practical conclusion, which may inform
scholars in the beginning stages of similar projects.
2 Methods
We compare four sources of transcription for 30
pages of the novel with one gold standard:
? OTS French OCR output
? Non-expert French speakers on Amazon?s Me-
chanical Turk (MTurk)
? Non-expert undergraduate students in the hu-
manities, closely supervised by the expert
? Professional transcription service
? Gold standard: early-modern French literature
scholar and editor of the critical edition
Given PDF images of a copy of the novel, each
source transcribed the same 30 pages2. The pages
are a representative sample from each of the two vol-
umes of the text.
We used OTS Abbyy Finereader OCR software,
which is trained on modern French text and has a
fixed cost of $99.
Three MTurk workers transcribed each page of
text, and the domain expert chose the best transcrip-
tion of each page. In future work, we could have
another round of MTurk workers choose the best
transcription among several MTurk outputs, which
has been shown to be effective in other NLP tasks
(Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011). We paid each
MTurk worker $0.10 to transcribe a single page.
Two closely supervised undergraduate students
transcribed the novel3, including the 30 test pages.
The cost per page per student was about $0.83.
Our group also hired a professional company to
transcribe the entire novel, which charged a fixed
cost of $1000, or about $3.21 per page.
The early-modern French literature domain-
expert also transcribed the 30 test pages from

scratch, and this transcription was used as the gold
standard for measuring accuracy.
Because the critical edition text should be as faith-
ful as possible to the original text, with no alteration
to the spelling, syntax, capitalization, italicization,
and paragraph indentation, we define as errors to be:
? an incomplete transcription
? missing or added words, letters, or characters
? a word transcribed incorrectly
? capitalization, bold, italics not matching the
original text
? incorrect formatting, including missing or
added paragraph indentations and footnote dis-
tinctions
In Section 3, we present a quantitative and quali-
tative analysis of the types of errors made by each of
our transcription methods.
3 Results and Error Analysis
Table 1 lists the error rate for each transcriber.
3.1 S/F errors
One of the most common errors made by all four
transcription methods is confusing the letter ? (or
long s), which is common in early-modern French
but doesn?t appear in modern French, with the letter
f. Figure 1 shows examples of phrases in the original
document that include both characters. These ex-
amples illustrate how familiarity with the language
may impact when transcription errors are made. All
three human transcribers (MTurk workers, students,
professionals) confused an f for an ? in (b). Interest-
ingly, the phrase in (b) would never be used in mod-
ern French, so the transcribers, not recognizing the
overall meaning of the sentence and wary of ?miss-
ing? a ?, incorrectly wrote seront instead of feront.
In contrast, the phrase in (a) is rare but does exist
in modern French. The MTurk worker and profes-
sional transcriber correctly transcribed feront but the
student, who probably didn?t know the phrase, tran-
scribed the word as seront.
The OCR system trained on modern French did
not recognize ? at all. In most cases, it transcribed
the letter as an f, but it sometimes chose other letters,
such as t, i, or v, in order to output French words that
exist in its dictionary. Although it may have been

(give alms). The student incorrectly transcribed feront as
seront. (b) ils ne se feront nul scrupule (they will have no
qualms). All four alternative transcription sources incor-
rectly transcribed feront as seront.
Figure 2: Correct transcription: Outre qu?elles me parois-
sent toutes dans la pre?miere jeunesse, elles ont des graces
qui vous ravissent avant d?avoir songe? a` examiner, si elles
e?toient belles (Besides [these women] appearing to me in
the prime of youth, they have graces that delight you be-
fore you even think of considering whether they are beau-
tiful. Transcribers made both conjugation (paraissent vs.
paroissent) and accenting (pre?miere vs. premie`re) mod-
ernization errors in this passage.
possible to train the OCR system on early-modern
French, the very slight difference between the char-
acter strokes means that disambiguating between f
and ? would likely remain a difficult task.
3.2 Modernization errors
Eighteenth-century French is understandable
by speakers of modern French, but there are
a few differences. In addition to the absence
of the letter ?, modern French conjugates
verbs with ?ai,?ais,?ait,?aient instead of
?oi,?ois,?oit,?oient and follows stricter rules
that no longer allow for variations in spelling or
accenting. Figure 2 shows examples of both. In
general, the authors of modern critical editions seek
to maintain original spellings so that future scholars
can work as close to the original text as possible,
even if the original work includes typos, which
we have seen. However, our human transcribers
incorrectly modernized and ?fixed? many original
spellings. This is likely due to the fact that it is
hard for a human transcriber who is familiar with
the language to not ?correct? a word into its modern
form. We observed this across all human tran-
scribers. For example, our professional transcriber
transcribed premie`re instead of pre?miere and one
MTurk worker transcribed chez instead of che?s. The
OCR model, which is trained on modern French,
is also biased toward modern spellings. Most of
its modernization errors were related to accents.
For example, it transcribed graces as gra?ces and
differentes as diffe?rentes.
Some modernization errors occur systematically
and, thus, are easy to automatically correct after the
initial transcription is complete. For example, all
?aient word endings could be changed to ?oient.
This is not true for all modernization errors.
3.3 Errors from page noise
Since all of our transcribers worked from a scan of
a copy of the original book held at the Bibliothe`que
nationale de France, noise in the form of small dots,
originally bits of ink, appears on the pages. These
small dots are easily confused with diacritics and
punctuation. Our human transcribers made such er-
rors very infrequently. However, this type of noise
greatly affected the output of the OCR system. In
addition to mistaking this type of noise for punctua-
tion, sometimes it affected the recognition of words.
In once instance, visages became ylfygc because of
small dots that appeared below the v and a4.
3.4 Formatting errors
We asked all transcribers to maintain the original
formatting of the text, including paragraph indenta-
tions, footnotes, and font styles. However, because
of limitations inherent to the MTurk task design in-
terface, we were unable to collect anything but plain,
unformatted text from those transcribers. In general,
our other human transcribers were able to accurately
maintain the format of the original text. The OCR
output also made formatting mistakes, particularly
bold and italicized words.
3.5 Other errors
Both humans and the OCR system made an assort-
ment of additional errors. For example, two MTurk
workers failed to turn off the English automatic spell
correctors in their text editors, which resulted in let-
tre becoming letter and dont becoming don?t.
3.6 Scholar overhead

Table 1: Mean number of errors per page, by error type

ering the error rate of each, we found that it is critical
to consider (a) the effort that the scholar must ex-
ert to correct, or post-edit, a non-expert?s transcrip-
tion, and (b) the amount of overhead required by the
scholar to gather the transcriptions.
All errors are not equally serious. We found
that the expert scholar had an easier time correct-
ing some errors in post-editing than others. For ex-
ample, modernization errors may be corrected auto-
matically or in a single read through the transcrip-
tion, without constantly consulting the original text.
In contrast, correcting formatting errors is very time
consuming. Similarly, correcting errors resulting
from page noise requires the scholar to closely com-
pare punctuation in the original text with that of the
transcription and takes a lot of time.
Previous research on gathering and using non-
expert annotations using MTurk (Snow et al., 2008;
Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010; Zaidan and
Callison-Burch, 2011) has been optimistic. How-
ever, that work has failed to account for the time and
effort required to compose, post, monitor, approve,
and parse MTurk HITs (human intelligence tasks).
In our exploration, we found that the time required
by our expert scholar to gather MTurk annotations
nearly offsets the cost savings that result from us-
ing it instead of local student or professional tran-
scribers. Similarly, the scholar had to provide some
supervision to the student transcribers. The profes-
sional transcription service, in contrast, though more
expensive than the other high quality (non-OCR)
methods, required no oversight on the part of the
scholar. After using all methods to transcribe 30
pages of Lettres ta??tiennes and critically comparing
the costs and benefits of each, we had the profes-
sional transcription service complete the project and
our expert French literature scholar has based a new
critical edition of the text on this transcription.
4 Background
Snow et al. (2008) gathered annotations on MTurk in
order to supervise a variety of NLP tasks. In general,
they found a high degree of annotator agreement and
inspired a plethora of research on using non-expert
annotations for additional tasks in language process-
ing (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).
OCR has been an active area of research in NLP
for decades (Arica and Yarman-Vural, 2001). Re-
cent work has acknowledged that post-editing OCR
output is an important engineering task but generally
assumes large amounts of training data and does not
attempt to maintain text format (Kolak et al., 2003).
As we described, for our application, transcribing
all content and formatting, including footnotes, ref-
erences, indentations, capitalization, etc. is crucial.
Furthermore, OCR output quality was so low that
post-editing it would have required more work than
transcribing from scratch. We did not attempt to
train the OCR since, even if it had recognized ? and
learned an appropriate language model, the format-
ting and noise errors would have remained.
5 Future Work and Conclusions
In Section 3.2, we mentioned that it may be possible
to automatically post-edit transcriptions and correct
systematic modernization errors. The same may be
true for, for example, some types of typos. This type
of post-editing could be done manually or automati-
cally. One potential automatic approach is to train a
language model on the first transcription attempt and
then use the model to identify unlikely segments of
text. We plan to pursue this in future work.
Although we hoped that using MTurk or OCR
would provide an inexpensive, high-quality first
round transcription, we found that we preferred to
use student and professional transcribers.The trade-
offs between speed and accuracy and between low
cost and overhead time were not worthwhile for our
project. If a scholar were working with a larger text
or tighter budget, investing the time and effort to use
MTurk could prove worthwhile. Using an OCR sys-
tem would demand extensive training to the text do-
main as well as post-editing. This paper enumerates
important challenges, costs, and benefits of several
transcription approaches, which are worthy of con-
sideration by scholars working on similar projects.
