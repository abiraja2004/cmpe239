We are concerned that the quality of results 
produced by an NLP parser bears little, if 
any, relation to the percentage-results c aimed 
by the various NLP parser-systems presently 
available for use. To illustrate this problem, 
we examine one readily available NLP tagging 
and parsing system, the ENGCG parser; and 
one tagger, the Brin tagger. We note responses 
to both artificially generated and naturally oc- 
curring text. The percentage assessments are 
methodologically f awed, and should be taken 
with a grain of salt; instead, assessment of the 
performance of an NLP parser should be ef- 
fected by a user, and solely from a considera- 
tion of the resulting parses of exactly the in- 
put which an NLP user decides to contribute 
for such an assessment. Careful attention to 
input of whatever corpus the user decides on, 
is presently the only suitable qualifying test of 
parsing ability. The parsers available are none 
of them perfectible yet, despite apparent yields 
now quoted at 99%+. We consider the impact 
of Zipf's argument of 'least effort' on percent- 
age assessment; and we open a discussion on 
estimating the relative complexities of corpora. 
1 Introduction 
Statistics are frequently bandied around in NLP, and 
would seem to be the obvious way to compare com- 
peting systems and methodologies. For example: 
As a rule, data-driven systems rely on 
statistical generalisations about short se- 
quences of words or tags....\[T\]hey t nd to 
reach a 95-97% accuracy \[and 12 parsers 
are referred to.\] Interestingly, no signifi- 
cant improvement beyond the 97% "bar- 
rier" by means of purely data-driven sys- 
tems has been reported so far...\[Then there 
is a report of three hybrids - systems that 
employ linguistic rules for solving some am- 
biguities - with various additions; and these 
hybrids\] seem capable of exceeding the 
97% barrier .... Next, a new system..uses 
only linguistic distributional rules. Tested 
against a 38,000-word corpus of previously 
unseen text, the tagger eaches a better ac- 
curacy than previous ystems (over 99%). 
(Voutilainen, 1995) 
We are concerned about the misleading nature of 
such published statistics, although researchers work- 
ing on NLP systems are of course well aware that 
the figures must be interpreted carefully. To be able 
to show our cause for concern we must look at the 
statistics of a well known parser, and also at its ac- 
tions. Unfortunately there are relatively few systems 
which are freely available for consultation or exami- 
nation, and for this reason we are forced to pick on 
some of the few systems that are. The criticisms we 
make here are not directed against he parsers we 
use as examples, but against he way in which our 
field is treating its statistics. 
Our main example is the ENGCG parser, in one 
specific form which" has been available for several 
years now, and frorc hwhich many influential variants 
have been spawned,~including theone being used to 
tag the Bank of English (Voutilainen and Silvonen, 
1996). Perhaps unfortunately for it, the ENGCG 
parser is very conveniently consulted on the Net, and 
statistics on it have been published. Another good 
reason for our examination of this parser-group is
the comment made by them, above, that "the tag- 
ger reaches a better accuracy than previous ystems 
(over 99%)." And the fact is that it does seem to 
represent the best approach currently. 
2 Assessment  o f  the  ENGCG parser  
The ENGCG configuration we are focussing on is 
actually a collection of tools or layers: morphologi- 
cal analyser, morphological disambiguator, POS tag- 
ger, finite-state parser and heuristic enhancement 
programs, etc. (Karlssen, 1990), (Tapanainen and 
Entwisle and Powers 215 Use of Statistics in the Evaluation of NLP Parsers 
Jim Entwisle and David Powers (1998) The Present Use of Stalisties in the Evaluation of NLP Parsers. In D.M.W. Powers

Jarvinen, 1993), (Voutilainen, 1995), (Voutilainen, 
1997), (Voutilainen and Silvonen, 1996). 
In this paper, we will use the name "the ENGCG 
parser" as referring to a specific ombination ofthese 
components in the manner that they are reported in 
Voutilainen (1995); in particular we are using the 
version which augments the underlying tagger with 
a finite-state parser, with heuristics witched on. 
In considering and assessing the statistics on this 
parser, and also the parser itself, we record that we 
should not like it thought we are only trying to crit- 
icise that program. So let us repeat hat in our view 
the ENGCG parser appears to be at least as effective 
as any other parser presently generally consultable 
or available, and that it may well be the most effec- 
tive member of that class today. Indeed, we see that 
parser as defining the standards for a corpus-based 
parser. But, as will be noted, we nonetheless think 
the ENGCG parser parses poorly, when it is com- 
pared with human parsers - a conclusion we have 
reached partly because of matters discussed in ?3. 
2.1 The  ENGCG parser  - a stat ist ical  
assessment by its creators 
The creators of the ENGCG parser make it clear 
that their parser is not expected to parse contrived 
sentences, and they acknowledge that sentences can 
be created that will result in a less favourable re- 
sponse than they report; they also mention that 
their parser is intended to work on such things as 
manuals and they acknowledge that it works less 
well on fictional literature. Their claim and spec- 
ifications are: 
1,200 "grammar-based" constraints 
99.7-100% of all words retain the appropri- 
ate morphological reading 
3-7% of all words remain (partly) ambigu- 
ous 
200 "heuristic" constraints 
resolves ome 50% of remaining ambigui- 
ties after heuristic disambiguation, 99.5% 
or more retain the appropriate morpholog- 
ical reading 
...The performance figures are measured 
against fairly neutral running English of 
the written variety. Similar performance 
on e.g. invented laboratory sentences i not 
guaranteed. 
(Voutilainen and Silvonen, 1996). 
As to corpus, Voutilainen and Tapanainen (1993) 
refer to their tagging scheme as having "been man- 
ually applied on some 20,000 words of running text 
from various genres as well as on some 2,000 test 
Entwisle and Powers 216 
sentences from a large grammar (Quirk et al 1993), 
as a first approximation f the inventory of syntactic 
structures in written English..." This allowed them 
to validate their approach informally and to "ascer- 
tain the generality of the proposed rules" (Vouti- 
lainen and Tapanainen, 1996, p4). Voutilainen 
(1995, pg) later used "a 38,202-word test corpus 
consisting of previously unseen journalistic, scientific 
and manual texts" to test the ENGCG implementa- 
tion of this scheme. 
2.2 The ENGCG parser -  our statistical 
assessment 
Our own assessment of the operation of the ENGCG 
parser, over the first 1000 words of Chapter 3 of "Al- 
ice in Wonderland" (Carroll, 1975) (which might not 
be described as 'ffairly neutral"; but it is our own 
domain of study), is that the parser reported 108 
(10.8%) words with extra wrong roles alongside the 
correct role, and 33 (3.3%) words with wrong roles 
and no accompanying correct role. 27 of the wrong 
roles that had no accompanying correct role were 
nouns that were mis-designated as to case, but were 
correctly designated as nouns. We did notice that 
there is no special tag specifically for the objects of 
non-finite verbs, and that these words were desig- 
nated as having the label nora (i.e. "nominal") as 
also were the objects of prepositional phrases; this 
caused an extra 10 responses which we regarded as 
unusual, but which were not counted as incorrect 
because they seemed to be correctly designated ac- 
cording to the designers' pecifications. 
Further, there were a number of words with more 
than one role in positions where the words were 
clearly ambiguous; and these too were accepted as 
being correct. Thus, our results for the ENGCG 
parser on the first 1000 words of chapter three of 
"Alice in Wonderland" is that 89.2% of the words 
had no extra wrong roles and 96.7% of the words 
had a correct ag amongst their final list of roles. 
We have conducted a further assessment on the 
operation of the ENGCG parser, over the first 1000 
words of Chapter four of Alice in Wonderland {Car- 
roll, 1975); the results there were less impressive- 
82.0% of words had no extra wrong roles (18.0% 
did), and 94.8% of words had a correct ag amongst 
their final list of roles (5.2% did not). 
Our conclusions regarding the ENGCG parser, 
and these figures on it, are that: 
1 for what it does, it works well, and speedily too. 
2 the difficulty that this parser faces is due mainly 
to the limitations on the starting roles (tags in 
the lexicon) on each word at the commencement

of parsing; the limitations are those supplied 
from a restrictive lexicon. 
3 The ENGCG parser can only throw roles away, 
never gain any; so there is no way of redeeming 
any limitations inherited from the lexicon. 
We see point 2 as the critical one. We suggest hat 
a tagger or parser should not arbitrarily restrict he 
starting roles of a word, lest that restriction happen 
to exclude some legitimate parse. Probably the as- 
sumption in the ENGCG parser regarding starting- 
roles for words is not a feature that can easily be 
removed from this parser, but we will not speculate 
further on this matter except to note that reliance 
on this restricted set of roles pre-empts some parsing 
decisions where valid possibilities are not acknowl- 
edged. These roles are never added back in later, 
so their removal decreases the number of roles in 
the final results. An alternative approach to pars- 
ing, which makes no such lexical restriction on roles, 
is presented by Entwisle and Groves (1994), but ex- 
ploring this further is beyond the scope of this paper. 
3 The  l im i ta t ions  o f  the  ENGCG 
s tar t ing  ro le  l i s ts  
We now proceed to demonstrate ENCG's depen- 
dency on the starting-roles, which we note are de- 
cided upon partly from semantic onsiderations; for 
this purpose we create and submit to the ENGCG 
parser some artificially generated sentences. 
Our sentences themselves might be considered to 
be contrived. Thus the parser's creators may say 
that our test sentences were not within the domain of 
their device. But keep in mind what we are demon- 
strating here: we are not arguing that the parser just 
fails, nor that it fails because it does not parse these 
reasonably average sentences. We are demonstrat- 
ing that such failures reflect the high dependency of 
this parser on starting from this more presumptu- 
ous position; that such parses effected by this parser 
themselves demonstrate hat that position is not an 
acceptable starting point for NLP. 
We report parses ubmitted, below. Sentence (1): 
has four words that have each two starting roles 
(noun, verb); each role being fairly equally balanced 
in three of those words in English corpus. Sentence 
(2): has words similar to sentence (1) but one word 
instead is disproportionately balanced, so one role 
is much more likely. Sentences (1) and (2) are syn- 
tactically identical. Sentence (3) shows a parsing 
failure consequent on the limited starting-roles given 
to the word changed for sentence (2). Useful words 
for demonstrating these limitations are words like 
watches and sails and fish, all readily noun or verb. 
In these parses, each indented line following a word 
in angle brackets has a separate role (or roles) for 
that word: e.g.man is given roles of subject and ob- 
ject; fish has three roles. 
Our first test sentence is: 
(1) The man who sails boats watches fish. 
The ENGCG parser could say little about this; it 
did say: 
"<*the>" 
"the" <*> DET CENTRAL ART SG/PL ~DN> 
"<mall>" 
"man" N NOM SG @SUBJ @OBJ 
"<who>" 
"who" <**CLB> PRON WH NOM

"<sails>" 
"sail" V PRES SG3 VFIN ~+FMAINV 
"<boats>" 
"boat" N NOM PL @OBJ 
"<watches>" 
"watch" N NOM PL @SUBJ ~OBJ 
"<fish>" 
"fish" <P/for> V 1NF @-FMAINV 
"fish" <P/for> V PRES -SG3 VFIN @+FMAINV 
"fish" N NOM SG/PL @OBJ 
"<$.>" 
Somehow watches has lost the role of main verb, 
which a native speaker would say was its only avail- 
able role. And there is a second syntactic parse 
in that sentence, not reported by ENGCG. That 
parse is: the:article man:subject \[who:relative- 
pronoun sails:verb\] boats:verb watches:indirect. 
object fish:object. Such a parse is, of course, seman- 
tically most unlikely. Note that boats here is working 
as a ditransitive verb (Entwisle and Groves, 1994). 
The verb ships has this subcategorisation (as in He 
ships them supplies each week), more commonly than 
boats. 
The ENGCG parser's reliance on starting-roles i  
clear, because of the different result when a sentence 
of the same inflection pattern, but with the word 
water, a word more commonly a noun, substituted 
for fish, is submitted: 
(2) The man who sails boats watches water. 
which gave: 
"<*the>" 
"the" <*> DET CENTRAL ART SG/PL @DN> 
"<man>"

"<who>" 
"who" <**CLB> PRON WH NOM SG/PL @SUBJ

Entwisle and Powers 217 \ Use of Statistics in the Evaluation of NLP Parsers 
"<boats>" 
"boat" N NOM PL ~OBJ 
"<watches>" 
"watch" <InfComp> V PRES SG3 
VFIN @+FMAINV 
<water>" 
"water" N NOM SG @OBJ 
,,<$.>" 
a better esult; ENGCG provided a parse that tradi- 
tional grammar requires, as well as a spurious parse; 
the reason for the improvement is clear when we ex- 
amine that parser's response to a sentence where 
water has the less usual, but not unusual, role of 
verb, in: 
(3) I water the plants. 
"<*i>" 
"i" <*> PRON PERS NOM SG1 SUB3 ~SUBJ 
"<water>" 
"water" N NOM SG ~NPHR 
"<the>" 
"the" DET CENTRAL ART SG/PL ~DN> 
"<plants>" 
"plant" N NOM PL @NPHR 
,,<$.>" 
The symbol nphr designates a "stray NP". The pos- 
sibility that watercould be a verb is not entertained 
by this parser; and a single, completely incorrect 
parse is the only result: noun noun determiner noun. 
An impossible answer. Note too: ENGCG signals an 
improper parse: but fails to signal the failure 1. 
We tested the ENGCG parser further: with other 
words of a similar nature, to show that this error was 
not a feature of just one word, water. We created a 
list of sentences to test starting-roles specifically: 
(1) The man who sails boats watches fish. 
(2) The man who sails boats watches water. 
(3) I water the plants. 
(4) Let him water the plants. 
(5) The man sands wood. 
(6) He fords streams. 
(7) They" dog his life. 
(8) The past fades. 
(9) He watches watches. 
(10) They dynamite bridges. 
(11) He compliments hem. 
(12) He ferrets out answers. 
l In this connection, the separate matter of permitting 
an "I don't know" response is an important feature in 
the correct approach to NLP but is not relevant in this 
paper. 
(13) He stopped hunting rabbits. 
(14) He sights along the rifle. 
The italicised word in each sentence is the test- 
word, the word of interest. Table 1 reports results. 
The ENGCG parser is relying to some degree on 
limiting the starting roles of words to only the more 
likely ones, then it starts at that point to parse - 
but that restriction still allow multiplication of the 
parses that ENGCG offers - out to twelve, for the 
case of sentence (1). This parser then attempts only 
to give the more likely reading(s), but it does not 
necessarily offer a legal parse. Because of starting- 
role restrictions, this parsing program is not always 
producing an acceptable parse, which is unsatisfac- 
tory. Indeed, we view the two clear parsing failures 
regarding sentences (1) and (3), in the conditions we 
have established, as further evidence of a somewhat 
weak parsing action, one which fails to use all of the 
syntactic onstraints in English, properly. 
We ran these sentences in the more recent 
ENGCG-2 Tagger(Voutilainen 1995) and received 
parses that were improved, but the substantial point 
remained, although to a lesser extent: that tagger 
had not received the instruction to accept he verb 
to water as a fully equipped verb, and so a variation 
in sentence (3) - to 
(4)Let him water the plants. 
returned water as noun only. Nor did that tagger 
report the second parse in either of sentences (1) or 
(2). 
Because the above sentences are artificially gen- 
erated, the ENGCG parser has been working in a 
domain beyond its design; but this, the full domain 
of all written English, is our interest. So, the aim 
of the ENGCG parser is not that of unequivocally 
parsing English, in NLP. 
The limited set of roles provided by the lexicon 
probably arises from omission, but we note-two con- 
sequences arising from reduction of the set. of pos- 
sible tags through omission of valid, but rare roles. 
The first is obvious: if there is less disambiguation 
to perform, the tagger and parser will be faster. The 
second is perhaps less obvious: if rarer roles are 
omitted from a parser then it is incapable of cor- 
rectly resolving them. It is possible to manipulate 
speed and error rate by judicious omission of roles. 
We learn from the above demonstration that when 
a word of a sentence submitted to the ENGCG 
parser needs a lower-probability word-role, it may 
not find it; in fact it returned astrange "four nouns 
make a sentence" type of parse. It was not con- 
strained by a grammar rule of English to say that 
water cannot be a verb - but by an arbitrary re-

English, the proper constraints must be used; no

starting-role in this manner. 
3.1 Consideration of  the result 
The foregoing may appear to have been very criti- 
cal on one parser, and on just one point. So let us 
here remind you what was the aim of ?3: to show 
that a parser can be covering over a lesser "parsing- 
action"; here, by a lexicon's restrictions on starting- 
roles for words. We had to document fully that pre- 
cise claim to make clear our complaint. After we 
make a comparison with results from another tag- 
ger, we will make use of those findings in the subject 
of this paper - parser statistics. 
4 The  Br i l l  tagger  
The second NLP system that we will examine is the 
older Brill tagger; we will first report on it, and then 
compare results from both ENGCG parser and Brill 
tagger. The problem of limited starting-roles, indi- 
cated in ?3 as causing parsing failures for the EN- 
GCG parser, is seen in the Brill tagger also. 
We found a slight complication i comparing the 
two devices; the Brill tagger offered only one tag 
per word. So, in applying the scoring system above, 
each incorrectly tagged word is firstly a wrong extra 
tag and then secondly a word without a correct ag 
- ?5.1. This counting method might appear a little 
unfair to Brilh the error counts doubly. However, 
consider firstly that that scoring system follows the 
same scheme that was applied to the ENGCG parser 
previously (where we had no choice but to score it 
th~at way, because that program could, and did, have 
one or more correct ags, or a combination ofcorrect 
and wrong tags, or wrong tags only - on a word.) 
Secondly, Brill said it was offering the alternative 
of more than one tag (but it just did not for our 
test text), thereby conceding the propriety of that 
scoring. Thirdly, we assess that scoring as proper, 
because English sometimes offers ambiguous syntac- 
tic roles on words; and an NLP parser must allow 
for actual English usages. 
In Table 1 are the results of tests o.n both the 
ENGCG parser and the Brill tagger - in respect of 
our above list of 14 test sentences, and also of the two 
sections of Alice in Wonderland detailed in ?2.2. The 
two separate results relating to each Alice chapter 
are "extra wrong roles" and "missed correct roles". 
The last column, titled "our test sentences", records 
the count of the number of mis-calculated roles, on 
each italicised word of our fourteen test sentences of 
?3 (scored at maximum of one error per sentence). 
In particular, we note that those two parsing pro- 
grams, ENGCG and Brill, failed to parse eleven and 
twelve words (respectively), out of those fourteen 
test-words contained in our testing sentences. We 
believe that our test sentences are not unnatural in 
any way. 2 Those results indicate to us that, in those 
programs, the starting-roles of most of those four- 
teen italicised words have been unduly limited. In- 
deed, the figures in the last column (titled "our test 
sentences") may have found a problem affecting all 
corpus-based parsers. Such a matter is not be rel- 
evant to this paper, and anyway we ourselves have 
not yet further assessed those figures, either. 
As noted earlier above, we have found the EN- 
GCG parser to be the most effective and informative 
of all readily-available current NLP parsers, and the 
strongest parsing program {though the results tabu- 
lated above do not completely vindicate our choice.) 
On this account, we have given above the detail that 
the ENGCG passer displays in its parses - for that 
information; and we will restrict comment and ex- 
ample hereafter, to the ENGCG parser. 
5 S ta t i s t i ca l  measurement  o f  parsers  
We are now in a position to consider the matter of 
statistics and parsers. We discuss the current at- 
tempted statistical measurement of the quality of 
parsing programs. We find these measurements un- 
convincing, and indicative of a flawed methodology - 
2We do consider sentence (9) to be a little unnatural: 
that sentence was submitted so as to test further on the 
word watches: and in the event, both programs found 
the correct parse there, so we feel bound to include it. 
We have reported all the sentences we tried. 
Entwisle and Powers 219 Use of Statistics inthe Evaluation of NLP Parsers 
for the reason that the measurements that have been 
adopted are not properly indicative of any gain-or- 
fall index in the ability of a parser to handle the 
syntax of the natural language of English. 
We find that there are difficulties over the use of 
these statistics in the evaluation of the qualities of 
a parsing program. Take a concrete case for which 
in the foregoing section we have established the fact: 
that the ENGCG parser failed to have the starting- 
role of verb included for the word water. This fail- 
ure, this omission, would almost certainly reduce the 
number of wrong roles that this parser would offer 
on almost any given corpus - unless the corpus just 
happened to include a substantial number of refer- 
ences to something about watering ardens, or sim- 
ilar expressions: that latter usage, of the verb "to 
water", whilst not unusual, is probably not going to 
be the usage met with by a parser using the type 
of corpus that the ENGCG parser advertises. Even 
with a number of occurrences of applying water, (i.e. 
using water as a verb), the parser will still probably 
show better results by omitting the possibility of it 
being a verb: for the most part the parser will oper- 
ate "more accurately" from the omission, so long as 
the number of verb-water is fairly small. 
There is no verb-role given to the word water by" 
the ENGCG parser in its response to our example- 
sentence (2} above (that "non-response" was of 
course correct); and the noun role given by it is cor- 
rect not only for sentence (2) but perhaps for about 
99% of the appearances of the word water. Wa- 
ter, the noun, is a word very commonly met. So, 
the omission of the consideration of a correct role 
for the case of sentence (3) above, happens to have 
improved the statistics for the parse of sentence (2); 
and that is so, even though another esult is that an- 
other ordinary sentence - sentence (3) - is wrongly 
parsed. 
How can that deterioration in the ability of a 
parser to handle English generally, be considered to 
be an improvement in parsing quality? We see this 
as evidence 'of a methodology that demands imple 
improvement in some percentage-statistics for a rea- 
son which logically might have been considered in- 
stead as causing a decay in that percentage: the 
reasoning behind such a variation of those statis- 
tics appears to us as flawed. These particular statis- 
tics for parsers, then, are meaningless: the figures 
could, if one really wished it, easily be increased 
right up to 99% (or even higher) even if water ap- 
peared once or twice as a verb. That enhancement 
could be done by omitting every alternative word- 
role from the starting-role list if that alternative is 
only seldom ever needed in the given corpus: that 
would cause substantial statistical enhancement of a 
parser's reaction-measurements on even a very large, 
genuinely naturally occurring, corpus. 
It could be argued that, because the parser then 
follows the main-chance reading of English, it is now 
actually the better parser for that. It is probably the 
faster parser, and it will respond with less spurious 
roles to many sentences, but it lacks depth in its 
deductions as a result; crucially in our view, that 
parser would have failed to tap any deep regularities 
of the patterns of English. Our own view is that until 
a parser is seen to be successfully handling sentences 
like sentence (3) without compromising its results on 
sentence (2), we do not care how good its statistics 
are on even randomly chosen corpora: such figures 
measure little, in our view. We do not suggest hat 
starting-roles here have been tampered with at all, 
let alne deliberately sieved for statistical improve- 
ments: we say that absurdities such as increasing the 
positive statistics of a parser by reducing its parsing 
ability, and such opportunities for sieving as above, 
mean that those statistics are valueless for evidence 
of parser ability, let alne for comparison between 
parsers. Once we see that a parser is considering 
English with a fair degree of depth in its appraisal, 
we are prepared to consider that its response to ran- 
domly chosen corpora has meaning; but not until 
then. Such a use of statistics not only impairs the 
way parsers are evaluated but undermines the whole 
idea of statistical NLP. 
5.1 Types  of  e r ro r  in an NLP  parser  
There are two separate rrors that we are looking at 
in relation to any computer-based parsing system; 
they both relate to the grammatical role or roles that 
a parser is offering in respect of a word. The first of 
these is: the failure to offer a correct role (i.e. a role 
is missing.) The second is: the offering of an extra, 
incorrect role. These two errors are essentially what 
is known in statistics (Speigel 1972) as, respectively, 
Type I and Type II errors - names which we will use 
hereafter. The two errors are also analogous to the 
errors of under- and over-generation respectively. 
We say that, if a parser is both losing wanted roles 
(Type I error) and also gaining extra roles (Type 
II error), each error to a non-negligible degree, the 
quality of the parser cannot be measured; and so the 
figures for ENGCG parser, of 10.8% and 3.3% (and 
18% and 5.2%) - ?2.2 - are of further concern to us 
on this count. 
If one were to make small changes to a parser, 
changes that did not fundamentally alter the pars- 
ing procedure but did alter the Type I - Type II bal- 
ance, then the consequent reduction in one of those

errors would result in an increase in the other. That 
much is clear. It is, however, unlikely that the two 
errors will move proportionately. On the contrary, 
for many systems, a change that causes a slight re- 
duction in either one, causes a large increase in the 
other, since parsers are generally balanced at a point 
that sets both errors to a reasonable compromise. 
But this point is often a finely-balanced and sensi- 
tive, one. We point out this problem to make it clear 
that an error-pair of 18% and 5.2% respectively does 
not imply, say, a "total error" of 23.2% or an "av- 
erage error" of 11.6% or any other such simplistic 
formulation. In fact, Samuelsson and Voutilainen 
(1997) show a hyperbolic relationship between the 
two errors (for the case of a 1988-style HMM-based 
parser). They name that relationship "the Error- 
Rate-Ambiguity Trade-Off". 
Thus, we claim that if both kinds of error in a 
parser are non-negligible, neither figure means much. 
So, while "watches" and "water" (and other words) 
are being denied verb-roles (i.e. error Type I is non- 
negligible), the power of the parser in the other di- 
rection (error Type II) has little meaning. How bad 
will the "extra wrong roles error" (Type II) need to 
become before the "roles lost error" (Type I) van- 
ishes? We cannot tell, from the information which 
those two last-mentioned writers provide. For our- 
selves then, we comment that only when we see that 
sentences like He dogs my life and They dynamite 
bridges are getting ood consideration (so error Type 
I has become minimal), can an "extra wrong roles 
error" (error Type II) percentage mean something. 
This is an alternative, and more general way, of 
viewing the concern that is the central point of this 
paper. By not permitting a parsing program to con- 
sider fully all the possible syntactic-roles on a word 
(by the use of limiting starting roles, say) error Type 
I is artificially raised somewhat, which lowers error 
Type II, possibly by a large amount; that forms our 
major concern. 
We refer above to a suggestion of keeping one of 
the errors minimal. If possible, of course, that er- 
ror should be brought to 0%, but the question of 
whether that is feasible is not going to be consid- 
ered here. 
E r ror -  ambiguity 
Voutilainen (1995) uses the term error for "error 
Type I" and ambiguity for any extra syntactic roles 
reported by his parser. We are concerned over such 
nomenclature because we cannot tell if these extra 
syntactic roles are wanted (i.e. genuine xtra read- 
ings) or unwanted (i.e. errors of Type II). Ambiguity 
is not necessarily an error; several genuine readings 
may actually exist in the original text. 
Genuine syntactic ambiguity is a completely dif- 
ferent matter from any part of the subject of this 
paper; and this is so, even though there are two syn- 
tactic readings of each of sentences (1) and (2): we 
do acknowledge that this means that the two sen- 
tences are each syntactically ambiguous (but surely 
not semantically so!). 
6 The  cho ice  o f  a corpus  in an  NLP  
parser  
We find that some kinds of naturally occurring cor- 
pora never give a convincing display of the power of 
a parser, when the parser is tested on them alone - or 
indeed measured by reference to them alone. Some 
of what occurs in naturally occurring text is very 
standard and repetitive in structure: technical writ- 
ing and newspaper reports use language that is very 
regular and repetitious in its patterning. Reams of 
this kind of text may have to be fed into a parser 
before that parser has been exposed to even a few 
of the many different syntactic phenomena that the 
language of English presents. And yet, all the time, 
these reams of text are prejudicing the statistics; the 
"percentage correct" count is nearing 100%, for a 
reason that is completely irrelevant o the parsing 
expertise of a parser - yet that, and only that, should 
be all that is being measured. 
6.1 The corpus approach to parsing 
We do accept hat the use of large collections of nat- 
urally occurring text is at least partly a resolution of 
the problems inherent in small parsers of the past, 
in parsers that were shown to work only on one or 
two special phenomena. To that extent, we welcome 
the corpus-based approach as a response to such an 
offering. But as we have shown, the corpus-based ap- 
proach is not without its own quirks. In summary: 
it is not the number of words that a parser can suc- 
cessfully parse (or even sentence statistics, which are 
dramaticallylower). The number of different linguis- 
tic phenomena and the amount of syntactic diversity 
that the parser can successfully handle are the only 
proper measures of a parser's power to parse; that is 
what should be being measured by parser statistics. 
We postulate that the more syntactically complex 
the corpus, the more a trial of the parser has been ef- 
fected. In this regard researchers should welcome the 
appraisal of their parsers by others' use of invented 
sentences. But we would never defend the use of 
some absurd 'trap' of a sentence, contrived not for 
enquiry, clarification or proper test, but merely to 
score points against a parser. A charge of 'unnat- 
uralness' in a sentence can be easily resolvable by 
native speakers or even by formal experiment, but 
Entwisle and Powers 221 Use of Statistics in the Evaluation of NLP Parsers 
only once the sentence has been placed in the ap- 
propriate context. A better option would be to find 
the required construct (or the actual sentence) in a 
corpus. 
We believe that artificially generated natural sen- 
tences should be used freely by people other than 
the authors of the target in order to decide on the 
quality of the parsing program, but, as is common 
practice currently, a report by the creators hould 
use corpus-generated measurements only. 
We are unhappy with riders like - "Similar per- 
formance on e.g. invented laboratory sentences is 
not guaranteed" (Voutilainen and Silvonen, 1996): 
as being almost intimidatory to critics. 
7 Es t imat ing  syntact i c  complex i ty  o f  
corpora  
We consider some of the potential to variety in lin- 
guistic corpora, and we have also suggested some 
possible valuations of that variety. 
7.1 Appl icat ion of  Z ipf 's  work  
Zipf's concept of 'least effort' may be relevant here 
(Zipf, 1947; Powers, 1998): Zipf argues that the sim- 
pler a construct is, the more often humans will want 
to use it - or the more often they need it, the sim- 
pler they will make it. Zipf's concept applies to 
complex syntactic onstructions too, and Zipf him- 
self has demonstrated that his law applies even to 
chunks of text as large as newspaper articles and 
books. Thus, by application of Zipf's concept, com- 
plex constructions will be correspondingly rarer in 
appearance in a corpus. If this extension of Zipf's 
argument is valid and applicable here, as we claim, 
then the extension indicates a further dilut_ion of 
complex syntactic structures in corpus, with a cor- 
responding further skewing of percentage r sults. 
Identifying and counting the number of different 
constructs begs the question in some ways, as there 
is needed an extremely large parsed corpus in which 
the rare constructs occur and are recognized. This 
would be an interesting project to perform in the 
Bank of English once the tagging (and preferably 
parsing) project is complete. 
There is, however, another way we can approach 
this: by identifying the obvious easy constructs and 
simply counting those which are not handled. 
A means by which the effects of repetitive or ob- 
vious constructs in corpora are removed from the 
scored percentages of parsers, appears appropriate, 
then. In order to do this, we wrote an extremely 
elementary (simple) grammar s (the rules for it are 
3Thought-time for creation of the '2"ules" for this 
noted in Appendix A). We then counted the num- 
ber of correct roles that this grammar gained, on 
a section of Alice in Wonderland. This simplistic 
parser scored a figure of 80.7% correct on the piece 
of text selected - which figure, in a sense, creates 
a baseline or zero-level for that piece of text. This 
is really the way that one traditionally develops a
grammar - the initial version would normally be en- 
hanced as further iterations are made, but whilst we 
were tempted to rectify the obvious problems, the 
statistics in Table 1 for this "obvious tagger" has 
not had the benefit of any refinement. 
This "grammar" is designed to be used only for 
benchmarking, not as a real grammar or for a pro- 
duction parser. It can be employed in either of two 
ways: On the one hand, a comparison can be made 
between different corpora, by using the figures as- 
sessed by the grammar to characterize the difficulty 
of a corpus. Alternatively, and perhaps more inter- 
estingly, the figure calculated by the grammar on a 
corpus can be used to bring percentages of correct 
roles on words into a proportion which does have 
real relevance to a standard of parsing. For an ex- 
ample for this test, the statistics of say 97% of the 
total number of words correctly tagged by Tagger 
X on a corpus which has been assessed as having a 
zero-level of 80.7%, is re-balanced proportionately - 
in that case down to 84.45%: by which we mean that. 
84.45% of the words that are a test to a substantial 
extent, of a parsing program, are being handled cor- 
rectly. It will be noted then that the grammar's rules 
leave plenty of scope to reward the parser which is 
operating even moderately well, and that the tech- 
nique can be applied to both type I and type II er- 
rors. 
The obvious parser is somewhat rough, but it 
makes the statistics offered by the measurement of 
correct word-roles on corpora far more meaningful 
as long as the baseline is set for each corpus - oth- 
erwise we are simply multiplying the error rate by 
5 if we set the benchmark ceiling to (roughly) 20% 
rather than the more commonly assumed 100%. 
Certainly, this re-balancing test means that a 
parser is no longer given credit for just correctly ap- 
plying a tag which is completely obvious anyway (for 
example, the tag article for the word the), but that 
is currently what is occurring. And since the is usu- 
ally the most common word in English text, that is 
usually occurring rather too often. 
We conclude this section by noting that the base- 
line grammar's surprising success on the sentences 
"grammar" - about an hour, much of that hour typing 
and refining those rules. This "grammar" has nothing 
whatever to do with our own parser noted above.

for which the others failed, probably results both 
from rarer more complicated constructs not being 
recognized (which is the main point of it as a base- 
line) and from the fact that the grammar is the sole 
influence on the result (there is no probabilistic bias 
or arbitrary selection or omission of roles on open 
class words). 
7.2 A measurement  o f  the  diff iculty- level o f  
a corpus  
Rather than one attempting to locate a base-line for 
measurement and comparison, it should be possi- 
ble to measure the comparative difficulty of corpora 
in terms of problematic onstructs. For this pur- 
pose, we chose one phenomenon as representative: 
the number of syntactic usages or subcategorizations 
of verbs. To do this, we first selected, at random, a 
point of the text, and then we counted off the next 
eighty verbs. We then counted the number of times 
a verb out of those eighty verbs was presented to us 
in a different form: that is, either the word had not 
appeared as a verb at all before or, as a verb, it had 
been in some manner, used differently syntactically. 
Thus the same verb could be counted twice if it had 
a different subcategorisation r syntactic variation in 
each of two uses in the extract; our suggestion be- 
ing that probably any syntactic phenomenon could 
be examined for variation, and verbs, being so cen- 
tral to a sentence, would probably indicate variety 
as successfully as any other syntactic feature could. 
We believe that a variety is indicated in the re- 
sults that we recorded, on eighty verbs: see table 2. 
However, we caution that the base line for the verbs 
needs to be determined from a comprehensive and 
representative corpus of English, and this has not 
yet been done. 
On examination following that analysis, we de- 
cided that the scientific paper was unusually varied 
in its style at the particular point that we attempted 
assessment, which may account for that high rating. 
Our own opinion is that these figures corresponded 
well with the amount of variety in each piece of writ- 
ing. In particular, extracts four and five were, in our 
opinion, of a particularly staid and dry, repetitive 
style. 
From this brief study, we suggest that it may 
not be difficult to assess the syntactic complexity 
of pieces of writing, and we intend to try each piece 
of writing on the parsers themselves to see if a cor- 
relation can be observed between our estimate of 
the complexity of the work, the variety amongst 
the verb-forms presented, and the responses of the 
parsers themselves.

so), and most of the adverbs, were all just given 
their obvious role. 
? Some words with an obvious class and a sec- 
ondary, less likely class, were given their obvious 
class only. The equivocal modals (will, might, 
can etc.) were all given the role of modal, along 
with the unequivocal modals (would, should 
etc.)

? All other words which may be relative pronouns 
were relative pronouns.
