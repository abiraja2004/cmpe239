differences are language dependent or due to differ- 
eat linguistic theories. The commonalities and dif- 
ferences in two ontologies are classified according to 
Hovy and Nirenburg as follows: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
I dent i ty :  The same concept is found in both 
ontologies. 
Extens ion :  There is a concept ill one ontol- 
ogy which is missing in the other, but which 
specializes the latter ontology fllrther. 
Cross c lassi f icat ion:  '\['he partit ioning of 
identified concepts into subeoncepts differs in 
the considered ontologies. 
The merging procedure t, hen keeps all concepts of 
cases (1) and (2) and resolves ease (3) by exhaustive 
cross classification. 
A simplified version of this procedure is proposed 
in \[How and Knight, 1993\]. Here, the cross elas- 
sification resulting fi-om nonmatching partit ions of 
identified concepts into snbeoncepts i replaced by 
parallel subordination of those subconcepts. This re- 
sults in a substantial reduction in the concepts nec- 
essary, but leaves open l;he question of the mutual 
relation between concepts stemming from different 
source ontologies. Participating NLI' components can 
be controlled well by such n shared ontology, but its 
adequacy as a point of communication i a joint MT 
systent is less clear. 
We have found that it is necessary to go beyond 
the original merging methodology in a number of 
ways. Nevertheless, as a eonsequence of the criteria 
for merging that we propose, not all existent con- 
cepts of the EUM and GUM need find their represen- 
tation in the Merged Upper Model and cross classili- 
cation is still significantly reduced without impairing 
inter-translatabil ity across concepts arising fi'oln dif- 
Drear source ontologies. 
2 .2  P rob lems w i th  ident i ty  
The crucial point in \[tlovy and Nirenbm'g, 1992\] is 
the notion of ' identity'. The decision how to deal 
with different concepts (identification, extension, or 
cross classification) is based on the possibility of stat- 
ing an identity between concepts of difl~rent lan- 
guage ontologies. This is somewhat problematic. \]\[21 
the comparison between the English and the Ger- 
man upper models, we took as identificatiou criterion 
the equivalence of the sentences or phrases which 
can be generated by the concepts. This correspon- 
dence relies on the assumption theft German and En- 
glish sentences have a one-to-one-mapping and that 
translation is a totally information preserving rela- 
tion. Although this is not true in general, we based 
our merging on the assumption that it may be true 
for simple sentences if we abstract out the textual 
and interpersonal i.e., non-ezperieniial (examples 
below) dimensions of utterances, and tim language 
distance is close. Hence, the whole construction has 
to be seen in the context of its own relativity. 
2 .3  Fur ther  P r inc ip les  
P r inn ip le  1: Remova l  of non-o .xper ient ia l  eon- 
nept  d i sc r iminat ion  
DifIicultics can arise when ontologies to be merged 
are themselves inherently problematic in some way. 
Internal problems hould not be autolnatically trans- 
mitted to a merged ontology. Thus, during merging, 
the distinctions drawn iu individual ontologies need 
always to be evahlated internally before being ad- 
mitted. The exclusion of textual and interpersonal 
inforn'mtion i a merged upper model provides an ad- 
ditional important criterium for an 'extended identi- 
l ication' of concepts within ontologies to be merged. 
Two comnlon kinds of non-experiential concept dis- 
criminations were found in the GUM. The first in- 
troduces distinct upper model concepts in order to 
motivate lexieogrammatical realization by differing 
types of grammatical  units. The second introduces 
distinct upper model concepts to motiw~l,e, the selec- 
tion of semantic roles Dora a given semantic onligu- 
ration that are to be lexicogrammatieally expressed. 
An example of the. first ldnd is offered by the con- 
cepts (Ll~elalional and C-l~elalionship :~. These are 
both responsible for the generation of processes ex- 
perientially classifiable as relational, but whereas G- 
gelalionship causes an attr ibutive or adverbial re- 
alization, G-Relational causes a. clausal realization. 
Thus, phrases (1) and (2) can only be generated from 
dill>rent semantic input expressed here in the form 
of the typed semantic assertions of the Penman Sen- 
tence t)lan Language (sPt,) \[Kasper, 1989\]: 4 
(1) Das Mitdchen ist kra.nk. (The girl is sick.) 
(a / c lass i f i ca tory

(2) das kranke Miklchcn (the sick girl) 
(a / proper ty -ascr ip t ion  
:domain (m / person :lex m~dchen) 
:range (k / quality :lex krank)) 
Th is  problenl does not surface so often ill the EUI~\], 
althougb there are occasional violations e.g., the 
inchlsion of 'rhetorical relations' that are explicitly 
textual (see \[Bat(man el al., 1990\] for details). 
Examples of the second kind a.re offered by seu- 
tenees (3a-b).

h. l)er bchrer a.ntwortet den Schfileru, (lass 
das l{amnschitf zur/ick gekehrt ist. 
(The teacher a.nswers the studeats that.. .  )
The differences in (3) arise from differences in the 
numbe.r of semantic participants in the answering- 
event that are made grammatical ly explicit. Both 
(3a) and (3b) could be used to deseribe the same 
experiential event, the selection being made on non- 
experiential grounds (e.g., lack of relevance of a par- 
ticipant, being known from context, known from pre- 
ceding text, etc.) specific to the text being created. 
3Conccl)ts fi:om the English Upper Model and the 
German Upper Model will be differentia.ted where rcl-- 
evant by prefixing either 'E-'  or 'G-.' as appropriate.

Both role, however, classilied semantical ly  under-

which requires that  the selection of semant ic  (ex

that  is often made ou textua.l grounds without  a

The GUM differentiates G-Agenl-eenlered, G-

The transit ive processes (with t;wo part ic ipants)  ~rc 
I'urther broken up into G-Agent-centered and G'- 
Affected-centered. The G-Affected-centered process 
type is a. very special case of a transit ive process. ' l 'he 
detinit ion is giwm ill \[Steiner el el., 19881 thus: "X

By these kinds of deta.ilexl considerations, we have 
filtered an intelligent merge out; of the mechanicM

German differences concerning tile participant nnm-

precise distribution for strong identical meaning is 
shown by the numbers on,side of brackets in Fig- 
ure 3. 
Un ion  
If both considered ontologies are equally weighted as 
ill \[How and Nirenburg, 1992\], individnal concepts 
in an ontology must be maintained in any merge. 
However, in onr approach we have extensively made 
nse of an ontology:internal concept union. This is a 
result of the general ontology design principles given 
in Section 2.3. The ehmse/PP distinction, for exam- 
ple, which is often a concept discrinliliation criterion 
in the GUM violates Principle 1 and so this <tiscrim: 
,nation is not preserved in the Merged Upper Model. 
Therefore, leaving out of account he clause/PP dis- 
tinct,on, identical concepts then amount o 163. The 
number and distribution of concepts identical after 
union is shown by the numbers in brackets in Fig- 
ure 3. 106 concepts are strongly identical and 57 
merged coneepts are identical with tire unions of dill 
fcrent GUM con(:epts. 
Extens ion  
Extension can be Pound in both directions. Because 
of the emphasis we have given to the EUM, most 
of the extensions are I';UM concepts which extend 
tile GUM further. These are 60 concepts, 11 for the 
Mental-Process, l l  Participants and 38 others from 
the Relational-Process hierarchy. On the other hand, 
only 4 German participant, concepts have found their 
way into the Merged Upper Model. 
Cross c lassi f icat ion 
An essentiM field tbr cross classification has been 
avoided by the relaxation of the upper model- 
grammar interface stated in Principle :{ in Sec- 
tion 2.3. For exainple, whereas the cross class,If- 
cation (liscussed for the MaleriaI-Proccss/Aclion lii-
erarchy in Section 2.3 would have cross classified 
2 Fmglish subconcepts with 5 Gerlnan subconcepts 
and their subhierarchies respectively, resulting in 42 
merged concepts, 9 concepts are suflicient o cover all 
distinctions expressed in tile EUM and the GUM. 
Slllillrlary 
Summarizing the urerging statistics, strong identity 
can be found for 41%. \[f we allow identification 
of unified concepts, identity can be stated for 63%. 
About 25% of' the merged UM are created by ex- 
tension, and only 3.6% by cross classification. Be- 
side this, there is a small part of t.he Merged Upper 
Model (8%) where the concepts are not crea.ted by 
identification, extension and cross classification, but 
by preferring IgUM concepts over GUM ()lies. 
3.3 Future work 
In the current merging proce, ss, we have only h)oked 
tbr identities and dift~rences between tile given En- 
glish and German Upper Models. Wc did not try to 
improve the inherent consistency of both, although it 
becanie clear during the merge thai, ccrtain distinc- 
tions should be removed and others tilrther devel- 
oped; these local improvements are detailed in \[llen- 
sehel, 1993\] and will be incorporated in future vet'- 
sions of tile Merged Upper Model. 
In addition, one of our tints with the Merged Up- 
per Model is to provide a stable basis for fllrther

extension both to include, tim;her linguistic I)he,- 
nolnelaa and to cover further languages. We cx-. 
pect that an organization of information based on 
the requirements of natural language gram mars will 
provide a inert st~d)le and re-ilsable resnlt than of  
ganizations based on the requirements of individual 
cornl)utational systems. We are already using the 
Merged Upper Model as the basis for sentence gen- 
eration in I)utch and l, here is suggestion here that, 
again, few additional concepts appear necessary. Of 
more interest is the extension to rather (lilt>rent lan. 
guages, some of which has already been begun. Ira- 
tailed accounts of this work of extension and com- 
parison are necessary since automatic merging will 
rarely be possible when these, most, general ewd'Is of 
information organization are considered. 
t!'inally, extensions in filtnre may also be made by 
colrtparison with other ontoh)gies although here it. 
is necessary to be very (:artful concerning l;he kin(Is 
of ontoh)gies considered. Since the Merged Upper 
Model is explicitly a linguisticMly motivated enter 
ogy, conlparisou witlt outologies with (lifferhig me 
tivations can be difficult. In considering the ontol.- 
ogy of the IAI,OG l)roject, for example, the nlixt,lre 
of linguistic and non linguistic information criticized 
by \[Lang, 1991\] should not be carried over into I;he 
lnerge. 
The evaluation of the resulting linguistic ontolo 
gles as potential semantic type hierarchies for repre- 
sentations in Inachine trailslai:ion, analysis and lnu\] 
t i l ingual generation is t\]ieu a eh!ar further step,
