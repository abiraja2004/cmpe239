WORKING ON THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: 
A SEMANTIC APPROACH 
1. GENERAL FRAMEWORK 
1.1. Foreword. 
The work described by the two co-authors of this article is pre- 
sented with a double objective: apart from giving specific details on 
a particular project they also wished to provide a concrete xample 
of the type of research which has been made possible by the Italian 
Machine Dictionary (DMI). 
The DMI is, in fact, one of the principal projects of the Linguistics 
Division (DL) of CNUCE. Other articles in the first volume of the Pro- 
ceedings also refer to the DMI. 1 In this introduction I intend to indicate 
briefly how the DMI project, and, in particular, how the research de- 
scribed in the article has been inserted into the framework of the whole 
complex of activities of the DL and into our general conception of 
linguistic data processing (LDV). 
As I have already stated in my introduction to these Proceedings, 2 
it is my conviction that, at this moment, special attention should 
be taken in order to promote, both on the theoretical nd on the practical 
level, systematic and ordered interaction among the many different 
LPD activities. In particular, this cooperation should be realized between 
those activities which focus on the construction of theoretical models 
and those focussing on the processing of large corpora of linguistic 
data. The activity of the DL, especially in recent years, has been in- 
creasingly directed towards this goal.

1.2. Activities of the Linguistics Division (Dr~). 
For approximatdy 10 years all, or almost all, of the research projects 
in the different fields of the linguistic data processing in Italy have 
been worked out with the collaboration of the DL in the computational 
side of their work.3 
In the field of lexicography, large corpora of texts have been pro- 
cessed in order to produce the lexical archives necessary to construct 
extensive historical language dictionaries (see, for example, the Tesoro 
della lingua italiana delle origini of the Accademia della Crusca), or diction- 
aries of " languages for special purposes" (e.g. the Dizionario Giu- 
ridico of the Istituto per la Documentazione Giuridica). 4
In both modern and classical philological research, the computer 
is now used with increasing frequency in Italy in order to automate 
the customary and traditionally time consuming task of indexing texts 
and producing concordances from them (e.g. the project for the analysis 
of the corpus of Grammatici Latini, ed. Keil), 5 and also for a number 
of more specific, complex operations, such as the automatic om- 
parison of different editions of the same text (e.g. the project for the 
' contrastive concordances' of Orlando Furioso of L. Ariosto). 6
Literary criticism and the history of literature are also beginning 
to make use of similar procedures, employing, in particular, statistical 
a For a more detailed escription and the relative bibliography see ZAMPOLLr, 1973a, 
1973b, 1977a. It is necessary to emphasize an important consequence of this fact. Firstly, 
almost all the projects underway in Italy in this sector adopt the standards introduced 
by the Dr. In addition, an automatic library containing over 5000 texts in more than 
20 languages has been established. This archive may be processed with general-purpose 
standardized programs because all the texts have been stored using the same scientific 
and technical criteria. Thus it is possible to perform some linguistic research operations 
which would otherwise be impossible. For example, one of our projects aims at con- 
structing a new model of the quantitative aspects of the language, on the basis of the 
data provided by this archive. The earlier models have been falsified by the new quan- 
titative data produced by the increasing number of text-processing projects underway 
in different countries. As a first step, we aim at identifying those linguistic facts which 
have a stable frequency in the texts of a language, those which have a frequency which 
is stable only within certain subsets of a language (literary genres, single authors, par- 
ticular themes, etc.), those whose frequency does not show appreciable regularity. In 
a second stage, an attempt will be made to construct and verify quantitative models to 
describe the regularities actually found and to identify the contextual factors connected 
with such regularities.

processing as an auxiliary tool in the study of the style of individual 
authors, schools, or literary genres. 7 Linguistic statistics is also adopted 
in psycho-linguistic studies, for example to "measure" the linguistic 
alterations introduced by certain nosological categories.S 
A combination of statistical processing and algorithms of the "pat- 
tern recognition" type are used in a heuristic way on traditional oral 
texts to identify clauses, formulae, and, in general, the various elements 
of the popular repertory.9 
In all the above quoted types of projects, the electronic data pro- 
cessing essentially aims at organizing, in computer storage or in printed 
form, all the linguistic units of a certain level (words, syntagms, 
syntactical structures, etc.) occurring in a text, in order to enable 
a more efficient, rapid and economic retrieval of them. In other words, 
the processing basically consists in the following types of operations: 
to input, store, manipulate t xts of different kinds (which may be con- 
sidered as facts of la parole); to recognize and explicitly represent in 
the text the occurrence of linguistic units (phonemes, lemmas, a~xes, 
syntagms, syntactical types, etc.: these units may be considered to 
be at the level of la langue); to execute some canonical operations (re- 
trieval, ordering, counting, comparing, etc.) on such units, in batch 
or conversational form. 
We also cooperate with some projects in the field of full-text 
information retrieval, which also uses lexicographical-type processing 
for documentary purposes, mainly on juridical and historical texts. 
All the above mentioned activities make use of closely inter-related 
procedures which the DI~ has developed and put into operation with 
the collaboration of various Italian Universities and CNR Institutes. 
More exactly, it could be said that the DL has realized, or is in the 
process of realizing, acertain umber of basic processing "components" 
and that each of the procedures so far developed consists in the con- 
catenation of some of these components. 
The functions of each of these components are well-known within 
the I~DP environment: he acquisition of texts in machine readable 
form; the production of the typical results of lexical analysis (different 
types of concordances, context-cards, etc.); the representation f the 
large variety of characters typical of the I.Dr; morphological nalyses

52 NICOLETTA CALZOLARI-LAURA \]?ECCHIA- ANTONIO ZAMPOLLI 
and consultation of Machine Dictionaries (DMS); syntactical parsers; 
phonological transcription; etc. 
I feel that the following three characteristics of these components 
should be emphasized. 
a) They are conceived so as to be, as far as possible, generalized 
(i.e. applicable to all the texts processed at the Dr, whatsoever their 
nature, language, or the purpose of the processing), 1? flexible (the 
user can activate, within the set of rules which constitute the " al- 
gorithmic linguistic knowledge" of the program, those rules which 
best respond to his particular needs), 11 and modular (the components 
must be inter-compatible and open to the inclusion of any eventual 
new components: the inter-compatibility is ensured by exchange- 
interfaces between the various components; these interfaces consist 
in a formalism which provides structures, organizations and codes 
for the representation of linguistic units both at the text and at the 
linguistic system level). 
b) These components may be used - at least in principle - with 
the same basic functions both in lexicographical-philological type ap- 
plications and in translation, documentation, question-answering, etc. ~ 
x0 For example, the component proposed for the acquisition of texts in machine 
readable form performs the following functions: accepts, as input, texts in any natural 
language (as long as they can be transcribed alphabetically) of any period, or literary 
form or genre (scientific texts, recorded ialogs, protocols, interviews, novels, inventories, 
etc.); stores the texts on auxiliary memory; produces listings which reproduce the text 
as near as possible to its original form; supplies text editing facilities for checking and 
correction of eventual errors. At the basis of this component is an encoding system which 
is designed to represent all the different graphemes and graphic features which can appear 
in printed texts or can be inserted in them in the preediting stage. 
xx For example, the context of a word can be constructed and delimited by acti- 
vating and ordering diversely a suitably chosen subset of the available rules from a gen- 
eral contextualisation algorithm (see ZAMPOLLI, 1971): to coincide the context with a 
structural unit (verse, strophe, etc.); to delimit the context exclusively on the basis of 
the punctuation immediately preceding or following it; to assign a specific portion of 
the syntactic structure as context, etc. 
x~ In particular, at the beginning of the 60s, attempts were made to classify the dif- 
ferent systems for LDP according to the so-called ' depth-parameter ' of the linguistic 
level of operation. Such classifications selected a certain "depth"  level along this pa- 
rameter, and drew in correspondence to this level the demarcation line between the 
uses of the computer in linguistics which merit the name computational linguistics (CL) 
and those which do not. 
Our viewpoint is different. All computational systems functioning for linguistic 
researches or which operate on linguistic data belong to the CL. Besides, at least in prin- 
ciple, the majority of those systems, independently from the fact that they are considered 
either below or above an established demarcation line, have a number of components 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 53 
c) They are, as far as possible, the result of  studies which are 
both research and operationally oriented. 
1.3. The Italian Machine Dictionary (DMI). 
The DMI has also been realized in accordance with these criteria. 
It has been conceived and is used as a means for semi-automatic lem- 
matisation, i.e. for the recognition of the occurrences of the various 
units of the Italian lexical system within a text. It is used in lexicogra- 
phical, statistical, philological text processing and is utilized in full- 
text information retrieval systems in order to identify in the documents 
all the different forms which belong to the same lemma of a specific 
form appearing in the " question " asked by the user. It will be used 
to associate to the words from a text the information requested by 
syntactical and semantical parsers (morpho-syntactical categories, syn- 
tactical "valences ", semantical markers, etc.). 18 
In the lemmatisation stage, the DMI can be adapted by the user to 
obtain lexical analyses at different levels of complexity. We think of 
the definitions of a lexical unit (lemma) as a set of pertinent features 
(morphological. syntactical, graphical, etc.). Different inflected forms 
in common. For example, a procedure for lexical analysis necessitates: the acquisition 
in machine readable form and the computer printing of a variety of texts and gra- 
phemes; a morphological nalyzer and the consultation of a DM for semiautomatic lem- 
matization; syntactic and semantic parsers for homograph disambiguation. An auto- 
matic translation system requires all these features (in addition to the transfer and 
generation components). 
13 Of course, we have considered whether it would be possible and convenient to 
compile a DM without having first defined in detail the components which will use 
the linguistic information contained in it. As an example, let us consider the choice and 
the formalization of grammatical information (morpho-syntactical tegories, valences, 
specification of possible constructs, etc.) to be coded in the dictionary as " input" of a 
syntactic parser. Obviously, this depends on the grammatical model and the strategy 
used by the parser. This does not necessarily mean, however, that once a DM has been 
compiled with specifically chosen grammatical information, it is necessary to substitute 
the grammatical part of the DM if the grammatical model should change. Although 
there are a number of different opinions on this important point, our experience has 
suggested that, eventually, it will be necessary to extend and complete the already ex- 
isting information rather than substituting it. In the majority of cases, independently 
of the definition of their theoretical status, the basic syntactical properties of a lexical 
unit may be formulated in a neutral way with respect o the model and systems which 
use them. This affirmation can be largely verified, at least for models within the same 
" scientific paradigm ", e.g. the generative-transformational ones. Nevertheless, there 
is perhaps enough evidence to assert hat the basic information, at the morpho-syntactical 
level, is still, to a large extent, valid, even when considering other paradigms uch as 
the so-called "artificial intelligence paradigm ". 
54 NICOLETTA CALZOLARI- LAURA PECCHIA- ANTONIO ZAMPOLLI 
of a text are considered to belong to the same lemma if and only if 
they have in common all the pertinent features which identify a lemma, 
distinguishing it from all other lemmas. We have constructed an in- 
ventory of features which may be used in the definition of a lexical 
unit. Such an inventory is based upon a survey of the features used 
both in lexicographic practice and in linguistic theories. Each entry 
of the DMI is associated with the set of all the possible features of the 
inventory which may be used in its definition. The user is allowed 
to disactivate those features which he does not wish to utilize: for 
example, the differences between nominal and verbal use of participles 
or those between adjectival pronouns and pronouns, etc. Obviously, 
if some distinctions are neutralized, the number of lexical units which 
constitute the DMI, as defined by the user, and very often the number 
of possible homographs, are reduced. In other words, if we consider 
the DMI a concrete representation f the Italian lexical system, in which 
the lexical units are defined using all the features proposed by the dif- 
ferent lexicological and lexicographical traditions, the user can modify 
the structure of this system and the inventory of its lexical units in 
accordance with his specific linguistic requirements (Zampolli, 1973a). 
In this perspective, the DMI is used not only as a tool for text proces- 
sing but also as an object of studies and research in itself. 
While in studies at the level of la parole the object is given immedi- 
ately for the r~DV in the form of corpora of texts, the object in studies 
on la langue must be specifically constructed. An example which can 
be given is the first step in a research on the functional load of the 
phonological oppositions of a phonematic system. This step consists 
in the inventory of the minimal pairs existing in the lexicon for each 
opposition and therefore it presupposes the existence of an inventory 
of all the different forms of the studied language in phonological tran- 
scription. The burden of creating an inventory of this type and dimension, 
and the complexity of the operations required in order to discover 
and count all the minimal pairs are such that all those tasks are im- 
possible without a computer. Another example could be a study on 
the "rendement" of the different suffmes, which requires an inventory 
of all the words in which each suffLx appears. 
In order to make research work of this type possible, the DMt has 
been conceived diversely from most of the other DMS in existence. 
These have usually been realized exclusively as components in trans- 
lation procedures, information retrieval systems, etc. Such DMS, almost 
always, include only a limited number of lexical items. 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 55 
The DMI has a structure and dimensions that allow us to consider 
it as an exhaustive, automatically processable representation of the 
lexical component of the Italian linguistic system. The DMI is, therefore, 
intended as an instrument for research studies at the level of la langue 
where exhaustive inventories, data and observations are necessary. 
1.4. Theoretical background. 
The research project described below by N. Calzolari and L. Pecchia 
is an example of how the DMI can be used in this direction. 
The actual situation of linguistic theory is that of constant change 
and development. Not only are the traditional models being con- 
tinuously modified but some researchers affirm also that the debate is 
now between theories which belong to different scientific ', paradigms" 
Examples usually quoted are the number of different generative-trans- 
formational schools (interpretive semantics, generative semantics, etc.), 
relational grammar, cognitive semantics. In this situation, some re- 
searchers present he following alternatives: whether the scope of the 
research work conducted in LDP must, of necessity, be directed towards 
a specific linguistic theory, or whether LDP can produce results which 
can be utilized by different linguistic schools. 
For the sake of simplicity we will examine certain examples from 
the syntax field. A clear example of LDP activity directed at a specific 
linguistic theory is, in my opinion, offered by the so-called ' grammar 
testers ', i.e. those computational systems which apply a lexicon and 
a grammar for automatic sentence generation. 14 
These systems, at least in the intention of their creators, constitute 
a concrete and precise specification at the computational level of a 
determined linguistic theory; the grammar is considered as a program 
used to produce sentences; the algorithms which interpret he rules 
are considered as a part of the meta-theory; the production of concrete 
sentences serves to verify the coherence of the rules, the completeness 
and lack of contradiction of the formal apparatus and to indicate, 
practically, the extension of the subset of language generated by the 
grammar. 
Evidently, these systems are intentionally strictly connected with 
14 This is not the place to enter into a discussion on the complex and well-known 
problem of the relation and the differences between " generation" as an abstract cal- 
culus of all the possible grammatical objects and the automatic "product ion"  of 
concrete sentences. 
56 NICO~.ETTA CAI.ZOLARI- LAURA PECCIIIA- ANTONIO Z~POLL I  
the corresponding linguistic theory, constituting, it could be said, the 
computational " transcription" ofit. The rapid evolution of the theories, 
the models, the formal apparatus require a continual updating of the 
corresponding computational systems, which does not seem very easy to 
realize, at least in practice. Furthermore, the generative-transformational 
schools whose theories are usually incorporated in these systems have 
so far only described isolated regions of the linguistic structure, aiming 
at verifying the adequacy of descriptive methods rather than at de- 
scribing coherently and exhaustively a language. As a consequence of
this, anyone wishing to use the results of their researches in a compu- 
tational system would face a set of isolated observations distributed 
in different regions of a language, not systematically linked to each 
other, but divided by so far unexplored regions. 
On the other hand, however, the analytical methods produced by 
the generative-transformational theories have revealed a very efficient 
heuristic power, and have considerably increased the precision and 
subtlety of the observations. The number of new phenomena that 
have been revealed has grown notably in the last 20 years. 
In front of this situation, the behaviour of LDV researchers may 
range between two alternatives. 
The first position is usually characterized asthe rise of a linguistic 
"computational paradigm", which is distinct from, if not directly in con- 
trast with, the generative-transformational par digm, and tends to assume 
the computational aspect among the principal characteristics of a lin- 
guistic theory. The conviction is expressed that the primary "focus" 
of linguistic research must be shifted from the description of the com- 
petence as formal abstract mechanisms towards the simulation-like 
studies of the processes which underlie the production and the com- 
prehension of the utterances. The "natural anguage understanding" 
computational system could constitute a powerful experimental nd 
heuristic tool for the study of the complexity and the constraints of 
these processes, making it easier to emphasize the mechanisms of interac- 
tion between the components which are involved in these processes. 
The scantiness of the results obtained so far (some of the devotees 
of this approach ave likened the situation to that of medieval alchemy 
as opposed to modern chemistry) makes it impossible to formulate 
even a summary judgement. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that this 
type of research is limited, and will be probably limited, at least for 
some time in the future, to the consideration of extremely limited 
language subsets. 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 57 
The second position seems to prefer, in the actual situation 
of linguistic theory, a systematic examination of the data to an im- 
mediate construction of a formal global model. Obviously, the use 
of abstractions or notions (e.g. those of transformation or of com- 
ponential analysis) whose theoretical state may vary depending on the 
global evolution of the theory itself, but which have been seen to be 
experimental devices of extraordinary efficiency in the analysis, is not 
rejected. The complex formal mechanisms proposed by the generative- 
transformational school is not implemented into a computational 
system as a representation f a " language theory" but some of their 
characteristics (form of the rules, relationship between the rules, etc.) 
are utilized to store, handle and organize the data accumulated in the 
inductive moment of the research. 
T.DV essentially offers two complementary contributions to this ap- 
proach. Firstly, it supplies techniques which permit he automatic handling 
of the data. Secondly, LDP studies algorithms which permit the data 
to be structured conveniently, organizing them so that their regularity, 
diversity, correlations, etc., can be evidenced without it being necessary 
to make this organisation dependent on the "a  priori " choice of a 
general global theoretical model. 
The inventories of linguistic units recorded in " machine readable 
form" must be considered within this framework and, in particular, 
those lexical inventories in which each lexical unit is supplied with 
an explicit, suitably coded, representation of its linguistic behaviour 
should be considered. 
In addition, the use of a lexical inventory would facilitate the defini- 
tion of the degree of exhaustivity of the descriptions and the evaluation 
of the extension of the phenomena studied. (The term ' extension' must 
be here understood obviously not as frequency of appearance in texts 
but as frequency of appearance in the system). 15 
At the same time, it seems that the time has come to systematize 
and put at the public disposal the linguistic data accumulated in machine 
15 The information is often represented by binary matrixes in which a line cor- 
responds to a lexical unit, a column to a specific linguistic property. This organization 
obviously facilitates the identification of identical or similar configurations, the veri- 
fication of the coherence between the contents of the interelated columns, etc. (see 
Joss~rsoN, 1969). The work of M. Glloss (1975) and his group in the construction of a 
grammatical lexicon of French certainly constitutes the most important example. Fur- 
thermore, the role which the lexicon and its description have assumed within the most 
recent developments of the generative-transformational school (Bresnan, etc.) should 
not be neglected.

readable form (texts, dictionaries, descriptions, rules, etc.) and the 
computational tools (software packages, integrated systems, mid level 
and high level languages for I.DI,, etc.) produced in different institutes 
of different countries in different ways, but on the basis of similar method- 
ological assumptions and of a general common sum of knowledge. 
It is within this framework, and not only for applied and oper- 
ational purposes, that since 1968 (ZAMPOLLI, 1968), I have promoted 
the construction of the DMI as one of the principle projects of the newly 
constituted Dr.. 
The project described in the following pages by N. Calzolari and 
L. Pecchia is an original development in the field of semantics along 
these general planning lines. 
2. TOWARDS A FORMALIZAT ION OF LEXICAL  DEF IN IT IONS 
2.1. Preliminary steps. 
This part of the article describes an attempt o formalize all the 
noun-definitions in the Italian Machine Dictionary (DMI). The defi- 
nitions recorded in the DMI were taken from the Zingarelli Dictionary 
(1970) after having undergone a first process of normalization and 
shortening. Part of the normalization process was to classify the Zin- 
garelli definitions into 9 different types and to mark each of these with 
a particular code. 
The main types of definitions are: 
1) the relational (coded as 1), which is composed of a) a fixed 
part representing a function, and b) a variable part, the basis; 
2) the synonymous (coded as 2), which is made up of one or 
more single words which are referred to for an explanation of the 
meaning considered; 
3) the one per ' genus et differentia' (coded as 3), which is made 
up of a) a fixed word considered as a classifier (the ' generic part' of 
the definition), and b) a descriptive or predicative phrase of the clas- 
sifier (the 'specific part' of the definition). 
The framework of our research is typical of componential nalysis, 
according to which even that which appears to be "a  list of basic 
irregularities " (BLOOMFIELD, 1933, p. 162), i.e. the lexicon, could 
become awell-structured and therefore formalizable set, in other words, 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 59 
a system. We were first given the idea for the analysis by the theory 
of componential nalysis, but we have attempted to expand its field 
of application which, up to now, has been dedicated only to well struc- 
tured sets, as shown in the work of componential nthropologists, 
(the domains of words of kinslfip), or to lemmas isolated from the rest 
of the lexicon (the well known example of Katz: 'bachelor '). Our 
intention has been that of extending the application of this theory to 
all nouns of the Italian lexicon. We are helped in this by the great quantity 
of material at our disposal in the DML As we are well aware of the li- 
mitations of componential nalysis, we have used it only as a tool, 
not as an end, in achieving our purpose. 
From the entire corpus of lemmas and definitions in the DMI we 
have excluded those lemmas and definitions which are marked as archaic 
or rare. We have analyzed, up to now, all those definitions classed 
under codes 3 and 5, i.e. those with one generic and one specific part. 
These are the most numerous groups of definitions. After this selection 
had been made, the total number of lexical items on which we are 
actually working is 28,873, among which 20,453 are monosemic and 
8,420 polysemic; the total amount of their definitions is 44,051. We 
have worked on this corpus of lemmas and definitions using programs 
and checks of different kinds, working in two main directions which 
will be discussed later in more detail. Firstly, we have extracted a
considerable number of markers whi& would be assigned to the highest 
possible number of lemmas. Secondly, we have started an analysis 
of prepositions, of prepositional groups and of other syntagms which 
can be considered as grammatical in a very generic sense. These syn- 
tagms have been chosen because they satisfy, simultaneously, the fol- 
lowing two criteria: 
a) that of occurring with a high frequency in the definitions; 
b) that of showing well defined semantic relations existing be- 
tween noun and noun, or between verb and noun, or between oun 
and proposition. 
2.2. Markers. 
In the first phase of our work, the aim was to extract a certain 
number of'markers ', starting mainly from the definitions; in other 
words, working in an inductive way. We obtained the first basic work- 
ing elements from a control of the frequency-list of the forms found 
60 N ICOLETTA CALZOLARI  - LAURA PECCHIA  - ANTONIO ZAMPOLL I  
in the corpus of noun-definitions. This list helped us to make a first 
purely provisional inventory of lemmas which might be used as 
' markers ' 
Then, by looking up the concordances of these definitions, we 
were able to test the validity of these basic elements. In fact we have 
ascertained that the most frequent lemmas in the set of noun-definitions, 
(i.e., the lexical entries which will be most probably used as ' semantic 
markers ') almost always appear in the context in a generic sense and 
in the first position, only occasionally assuming a specific sense in dif- 
ferent positions. The fact that, as expected, with the exclusion of syn- 
tactic words such as prepositions, conjunctions, articles, etc., the highest 
frequency-indexes pertain to the grammatical category of nouns has 
also been relevant. 
We shall use the name ' markers' to refer to these most frequent 
lemmas: but there is a difference between our' markers' and the markers 
referred to in componential analysis; although our markers function 
as markers usually do, i.e., they describe a meaning or part of it, they 
remain essentially emmas. It is thus not necessary to use a metalanguage 
different from the language which is being described; the elements of 
the lexicon can be given a metalinguistic function. 
These markers have been grouped into lists on the basis of different 
semantic riteria such as synonymy, antonymy, etc. We have also 
made a distinction between markers behaving as one-place predicates 
and markers behaving as two-or n-place predicates. 
A first group of 450 semantic markers was extracted and matched 
by a program with the generic part of all the definitions. We have 
verified that 22,146 definitions out of 47,291 were covered, in their 
generic part, by these markers. This first part of the work is described 
in more detail in CAI~ZOI.Am, MORETTI (1976). 
In the prosecution of the work, through further additions or sub- 
stitutions of semantic markers which were either provided by literature 
on this subject, or resulted from our intuition, or by other successive 
analyses on the corpus, we have covered 40,135 definitions with 407 
markers. 
We have ascertained that, in almost every case, the generic part 
of the definitions of the DMI (and therefore of the Zingarelli) gives 
the word whose level is immediately higher with respect o that of 
the defined lemma (considering a hierarchical c assification moving from 
the more specific to the more general, i.e. from a greater to a smaller 
intension). This homogeneity in the definitions justifies the validity 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 61 
of the method we have adopted to refer all the lemmas back to the 
markers. 
In practice, for the lemmas not covered by markers after the first 
procedure of matching, i.e. for those lemmas which are defined, in their 
generic part, by words which are too specific to be used as markers, 
we have established some chains which refer back to more and more 
generic words until at least one marker is reached. In order to construct 
these chains we used a procedure to convert all the lemmas into numbers: 
this seemed to be the simplest way to keep in main storage the great 
quantity of data we had to work with. Using a program which works 
on these numbers, we have simulated a path for each lemma. This 
path starts from the lemma itself, and the program examines the generic 
part of the definition of the \]emma. The program checks if this generic 
part is included in the list of markers, and in any case examines this 
generic part itself as a lemma to be defined and looks for its definition; 
the procedure continues in this way until the generic part of a definition 
is found to be a marker without any other more generic marker above 
it. By this procedure, 91% of the definitions have been reconducted 
to the markers, i.e. 40,135 out of 44,051. 
By means of these chains, we have given the noun-dictionary a 
resemblance to a tree-structure. This tree-structure has been formed 
using the definitions of the DMI for almost all the lemmas; the hierar- 
chical structure we have given to the markers has, on the contrary, 
been partly taken from the definitions, and partly imposed by us ac- 
cording to the traditional rules of class inclusion.

In setting these chains (see Fig 1), we discovered that some chains 
of definienda and definientlc; are circular, e.g. PARTE is defined in the 
DlviI as PEZZO, and PEZZO as PARTE (see also CALZOZARr, 1977). 
In the example given in Fig. 1, the asterisk indicates the presence of 
at least one marker in the chain; the first number indicates the length 
of the chain; the second the length of the chain if it is circular; the 
third the distance between the two identical emmas in the circular 
chain. 
It has been possible, using these chains, to assemble the entire dic- 
tionary around some essential cores of more inclusive meanings. These 
cores are the tops of the trees, and from there thick branches lead off 
to the more particular and specific levels of the lexicon. The final data 
concerning the number and depth of the chains are shown in Table 1.

Moreover, for every marker (see Fig. 2), we have counted the 
number of times it occurs in all the chains (second column), and the 
number of times it appears in the chains which stop at the first marker 
(third column). In both of these cases, we have computed separately 
the occurrences of the marker at all the levels (lst, 2nd, 3rd, etc.; the 
1st column indicates the levels).

2.3. Definition-Structures. 
As far as the structure of the definitions is concerned, we wanted 
to start the analysis again from the definitions themselves (not trying 
to test some preconceived structures), with a careful checking of the 
corpus of definitions. 
We have extracted prepositions, and prepositional or grammatical 
syntagms, on the basis of a frequency-criterion, placing together under 
the term 'locution' or 'prepositional syntagm' (even if this term 
is not a very exact one) expressions of this kind: 
a forma di (in the form of); 
dal colore (of colour); 
provvisto di (provided by); 
munito di (furnished with); 
in contrasto con (in opposition to); 
consistence in (consisting in); 
simile a (similar to); 
originario di (originating from); 
che serve per (which serves for/as); etc. 
64 NICOLETTA CALZOLARI  - LAURA PECCHIA  - ANTONIO ZAMPOLL I  
These phrases which we will call, arbitrarily, 'prepositional syn- 
tagms' have been divided into various categories. This subdivision 
was made possible through an introspective examination of the asso- 
ciations of analogous meanings. The criterion was the individualization 
of the recurring semantic functions which have a similar meaning, 
even though these functions have been expressed lexically and/or 
syntactically in a completely different way. 
One example of such grouped functions is the category SCOPO 
(aim), for which we have individualized the following set of lexi- 
calizations (when necessary, with relative flection): 
tendente a (tending to); 
diretto a (aimed at); 
volto a (directed to); 
con Io scopo di (with the purpose of); 
a scopo di (for the purpose of); 
che ha Io scopo di (which has the purpose of); 
che mira a (which aims at); 
chi mira a (who aims at); 
mirante a (aiming at); 
rivolto a (turned to); 
per conseguimento d; (for achieving); etc. 
We have grouped these lists of prepositions and prepositional syn- 
tagms into files on the basis of their affinity of meaning. This has been 
possible through the analysis of the functions and of the different possi- 
bilities of their expression, following inductive and deductive methods. 
The validity of these associations of meaning, made intuitively, 
was afterwards verified empirically: various procedures for the ex- 
traction of the definitions in which each function appears, provided 
the material to be analyzed for this checking. For instance, in the analysis 
of various relations, such as those we called ATT ITUDINE (aptitude), 
COLORE (colour), FORMA (form), CONTENUTO (content), ORI -  
G INE  (origin), SCOPO (aim), USO (use), SOMIGL IANZA (simi- 
larity), COMPOS TO (composed of), MUNITO (furnished with), RE-  
LAT IVO A (relative to), the check of all the definitions in which 
elements of the corresponding lists appear has shown the validity 
(about 80-90%) of our groupings made on the basis of our intuition. 
In addition, from this careful examination of different groups of defi- 
nitions, we obtained some data which made it possible for us to for- 
mulate some interesting considerations. 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 65 
We have observed, for instance, that the definitional structure based 
on the relation A TTITUDINE (aptitude) has a quantitatively high 
homogeneity of application with respect o the lemmas in whose defi- 
nitions the relation is used. In fact, in 50% of the definitions in which 
this relation appears, it is applied to lemmas whose generic part, i.e. 
whose main semantic marker, is included in the list of homogeneous 
markers we have called S TRUMENTO (instrument) (see Fig. 3). Ex- 
amples of the recurring generic parts with a high frequency are: Mec- 
canismo (mechanism); Organo (organ); Congegno (contrivance); Appa- 
rato (apparatus) ; Attrezzo (implement); Strumento (instrument); Arnese 
(tool) ; Dispositivo (device); Apparecchiatura ( pparatus); Macchina 
(machine) ; Attrezzatura (equipment) ; Apparecchio (apparatus). 
ACCIARINO = Dispositivo atto a determinate l'accensione 
Flint-lock Tool apt to cause accension 
ARCHIPENDOLO = Strumento atto a rendere orizzontale una retta 
Plumb-line Instrument apt to make a straight line horizontal 
CARICATORE = Attrezzatura tta al carico e allo scarico di materiali 
Loader Machinery apt to load and unload materials 
SPEZZATRICE  = Macchina del panificio atta a tagliare la pasta in pezzi  
Cutter Machine of the bakery apt to cut the dough into pieces 
Fig. 3. Examples in which the function ATT ITUDINE (aptitude) selects the particular 
marker STRUMENTO (instrument). 
It is interesting to point out the way in which a certain definition 
structure can be frequently associated to a certain kind of marker. 
Other definition structures linked to other functions can make it 
possible to delimit, within the lexicon, sufficiently homogeneous se- 
mantic fields. Since these associations between markers and functions 
occur in several groups of definitions, we think that this correspondence 
' marker-relation' is not random, but is established for semantic reasons 
of affinity at a syntagmatic level. It seems possible for us to assert, at 
this point, that some markers effect a preferential selection toward 
certain types of defining relations rather than others, and vice versa. 
If this hypothesis is tested extensively on the lexicon, it can help in 
reaching aformalization of the semantic information which is in the DML 
We think that a more complete formalization, in comparison to 
that obtained by the simple hierarchical organization of the markers, 
can be achieved by also identifying the other kinds of relations which 
are different from the hierarchical one. Functions uch as those described 
above will allow: 
66 NICOLETTA CALZOLARI  - LAURA PECCHIA  - ANTONIO ZAMPOLL I  
a) the linking of markers: for example, the pertinence relation 
PARTE (part) makes it possible to link the markers PERSONA 
(person), UOMO (man), DONNA (woman), with a set of markers 
such as MANO (hand), CAPELL I  (hair), BOCCA (mouth), TESTA 
(head), CAPO (head), etc.; and/or 
b) the joining of the generic to the specific part of the definitions, 
for example in the definition of 
ACCHIAPPAMOSCHE = Strumento atto a catturare mosche 
(Fly-swatter ----instrument apt to catch flies) 
the function SCOPO (aim), in its lexicalization ATTO A (apt to), 
links the marker STRUMENTO (instrument) to its specification. 
For the final structure of the definitions, we think that the markers 
can either be considered as n-place predicates joined to their arguments 
by these various types of functions, or as nodes of a semantic network 
linked to the specific part of the definitions, i.e. the other nodes, by 
arcs which express these various types of functions. 
Such relations can be used as the starting point in the study of the 
use of prepositions and prepositional syntagms in the Italian language 
and, particularly, in the language of vocabulary definitions. 
Unifying these functions is also of great help in structuralizing the 
definitions, at a higher level of formalization, assisting greatly in the 
extraction of all the data linked by the same function. 
We have also noticed that some types of sentence-structure occur 
more frequently in the definitions. Besides considering the functions 
in isolation, we have been working on a quantitative xamination of 
the various possible matchings of these functions among themselves; 
this has been done with the aim of also identifying the kinds of sentence- 
structures more frequently used by lexicographers in the compilation 
of dictionaries. A practical goal for us is to work further towards 
the unifying of the definitions, by leading them back, as far as possible, 
to the more frequent and common structures. 
2.4. Perspectives. 
Our research ad a number of different aims but was principally 
directed towards the lexicographic aspect. This aspect consists in an 
attempt to analyze the defining method adopted by Italian lexicographic 
tradition as shown by the Zingarelli. This analysis has been developed 
in two different stages: 
THE ITALIAN MACHINE DICTIONARY: A SEMANTIC APPROACH 67 
1) An analysis of the terminology used in the definitions, through 
the enucleation of markers. We have seen that, among the most frequent 
lemmas in the definitions (i.e. among those words whose extension 
is greater or, in other words, whose intension is smaller), those words 
considered as markers by literature on this subject appear. 
2) A check of the definitions considered from the point of view 
of their structure. This emphasized the very high frequency of certain 
types of functional syntagms as being more suitable in compiling defi- 
nitions. It will be interesting to have a comparative xamination with 
dictionaries of other languages. 
The semantic aspect is very closely related to the lexicographic 
aspect of this study. Our aim was to give a hierarchical type of organ- 
ization, even if provisional, to the large set of Italian nouns at our 
disposal. In doing so, we have taken what in our opinion is the first 
step towards a decomposition of a meaning into distinctive markers, 
i.e. the attribution as main semantic marker of the lemma which is at 
an immediately higher level in a hierarchical scale. Many hierarchical 
scales can be individualized in the lexicon, or more precisely among 
the meanings of the lexical items. 
We have also begun, through the study of prepositional functions, 
the second step in the decomposition of a meaning into markers: the 
linking of markers with other markers, the individualization of the 
different kinds of relations which exist among markers, and of those 
relations which exist between primary and secondary markers expressed 
respectively by the generic and the specific part of the definitions. 
There is also an important practical aspect of this work: that of 
making the definitions of the DMI more uniform from a semantic point 
of view. This is achieved by indicating the semantic uniformities which 
are latent under the different lexicalizations of the same markers or of 
identical relations, and by reducing these diversities of lexical forms 
to one single symbol reflecting their uniformity. This will make the 
looking up of the DMI easier. 
This work should also be of relevance, at a future date, in connection 
with an analysis of the verb which takes into consideration the above 
mentioned analyses of the noun at a level of selectional restrictions 
at first, and, later, extends these analyses to the level of "knowledge 
of the world ". Thus, we feel that our work can provide a first step 
for a future utilization of the DMI in syntactic and semantic analyses of 
the Italian language.
