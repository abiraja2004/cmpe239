The Temple project has developed an 
open multi.lingual rchitecture and 
software support for rapid 
development of extensible Machine 
Translation functionalities. The 
targeted languages are those for 
which Natural Language Processing 
and human resources are scarce or 
difficult to obtain. The goal is to 
support rapid development of 
machine translation functionalities in 
a very short time with limited 
resources. 
The Temple Translator's 
Workstation is incorporated into a 
R6mi Zajac 
Computing Research Laboratory 
New Mexico State University 
zajac@crl.nmsu.edu 
Tipster document management 
architecture and it allows both 
translator/analysts and monolingual 
analysts to use the machine- 
translation function for assessing the 
relevance of a translated document or 
otherwise using its information i  the 
performance of other types of 
information processing. Translators 
can also use its output as a rough 
draft from which to begin the process 
of producing a translation, following 
up with specific post-editing 
functions. 
Figure 1: The Temple tools. 
Overview 
Glossary-Based Machine-Translation (GBMT) was 
first developed at CMU as part of the Pangloss 
project \[Nirenburg 95; Cohen et al, 93; Nirenburg 
et al, 93; Frederking et al, 93\], and a sizeable 
Spanish-English GBMT system was implemented. 
The Temple project has built upon this experience 
and extended the GBMT approach to other 
languages: Japanese, Arabic, and Russian. This 
expetience with other languages has provided 
significant insights for the development of a 
versatile GBMT engine and for the use of off-the- 
shelf components for building a complete Machine- 
Translation System. Building a generic platform for 
integrating various Machine-Translation Systems in 
a single flexible user environment built upon the 
Tipster document architecture \[COris~an 95\], has 
also been a valuable experience for developing 
genetic Natural Language Processing support 
systems. 
The user interface of the Temple Workstation 
includes a collection/document browser, the Tipster 
Editor for Documents, a genetic translation 
function, access to lexical resources and context- 
sensitive help (Figure 1). 
The Temple Translator's Workstation design is 
~iginal in that it combines the best features and 
eliminates the weaknesses of competing 
alternatives. On the one hand, like word-based 
glossers, it puts the user in control by allowing all 
core linguistic components used by the glossary- 
based engine to be accessed, modified and 
developed by the translator. On the other hand, like 
advanced MT systems, it uses reliable 
morphological processors and taggers, components 
which are relatively inexpensive, require little or no 
maintenance, and greatly enhance output quality. 
Currently, the Temple prototype provides automatic 
raw ~n?1ish translations from documents in several 
languages (Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and Russian). 
Translations are produced using a GBMT engine.

Analysts and translators can edit the raw translation 
using a multilingual editor (Figure2). Source 
documents and their translations are managed using 
the Tipster Document Manager developed at CRL, 
which is also used as the architectural basis for 
integrating the system's components. 
The core components of the glossary-based ngine 
are the bilingual dictionaries and the bilingual 
glossaries, which can easily include entries based 
on translators' own notes using a mulfilingual 
lexical database ditor. It is this very database that 
is accessed at run time by the machine-translation 
system. Thus, when a translator modifies the lexical 
database (Figure 5), the modifications are 
immediately seen and used by the glossary-based 
engine in the machine-translation system. By 
contrast, in MAHT systems, dictionaries and 
glossaries are intended for human access only, and 
in almost all advanced MT systems, dictionaries 
(but not glossaries) can only be accessed and 
updated by a lexicologist with special tralnin~g.

Architecture 
The Temple prototype includes: 
? A GBMT engine that provides an automatic 
translation for each language pair. 
? Morphological analyzers, bilingual 
dictionaries, and bilingual glossaries for 
Spanish, Arabic. Japanese and Russian, and 
an English morphological generator 
\[Penman 88\]. 
? A multilingual document editor (the Tipster 
Editor for Documents developed at CRL 
under the Norm projecO used to browse 
documents and their translation. 
? A multilingual dictionary and glossary 
editor and utilities to parse and load flat 
dictionary (Machine-Readable 
Dictionaries) and glossary files into the 
system's lexical database. 
? Corpus-based utilities to automatize the 
acquisition of bilingual glossaries. 
? A Tipster Document Manager to support 
access and processing of user's documents. 
The Temple architecture is capable of handling a 
large number of character codesets through the use 
of the multilingual text library developed at CRL, 
which includes a multilingual string library, a 
multilingual widget library (use fig example to 
develop the mulfilingual exical editor) and the 
multilingual Tipster Editor for Documents. 
Tipster annotations are used as a lingua franca for 
representing linguistic information shared among 
various NIP components, uch as morphological 
analyzers, taggers, bilingual dictionaries, the 
GBMT engine and the morphological generator. 
Each component has access to the common data 
structure through aunique interface provided by the 
Tipster Document Manager developed at CRL. 
NIP components are integrated in the architecture 
% 
102 
through TCL wrappers and filters that interface the 
component with the Temple representation stored 
as annotations in the Tipster Document Manager. 
Since most of the NLP components use linguistic 
representation that may widely differ, a single 
internal representation is used, e.g., for encoding 
part-of-speech, morphological features, etc. An 
NLP component interface to the document manager 
includes a mapping from the component 
representation to the Temple internal unique ? 
linguistic representation. 
One important outcome of the Temple project is the 
development of an architecture to support he reuse 
of NLP tools and resources: 
Tools that are acquired from an external 
source, such as morphological analyzers, 
generators, or taggers, can be integrated in 
the system with a minimum of programming 
effort. 
Heterogenecms linguistic resources are 
parsed and mapped to a common 
multilingual representation.

Glossary-Based Machine 
Translation 
The GBMT engine is the core component of the 
workstation machine-translation function. The 
GBMT engine is parametrized by a bilingual 
glossary. The bilingual glossary is essentially a 
phrasal dictionary: a glossary entry contains a 
source phrase pattern, a set of corresponding target 
phrase patterns, and correspondences between 
variables in the source and in the target patterns 
(Figure 4). 
A GBMT system produces a phrase-by-phrase 
translation of the source texL falling back on a 
word-by-word translation when no phrase from the 
glossary matches the input. Thus, the size of the 
glossary and the flexibility of the pattern language 
are crucial for the production of better 
translations.The GBMT engine processes ource 
tree structures in four steps: 
1. Glossary phrases are matched within 
sentence sub-trees (produced by a 
morphological ~,alyzer and various 
taggers and segmenters, depending on the 
language); 
2. Target phrases patterns are added in the 
tree for each source phrase match; 
3. M~xphological information is transferred 
from source tokens to target okens; 
4. Agreement binding information is 
generated for each source phrase. 
The tree structure manipulated by the GBMT 
engine contains both the source tree and the target 
tree which are simply source and target projections 
of the same data structure. Each target ree's lexical 
token is then sent to the morphological generator 
which produces the surface inflected form of each 
lexical token. Finally, the resulting fully 
instantiated tree structure is processed to produce a
103 
target Tipster document which contains altemative 
translations, tagging and morphological 
information and constituent information stored as 
Tipster annotations.

Reuse of MRDs 
Bilingual dictionaries that are used for the word- 
for-word fall-back translation are processed 
versions of various MRDs 1 (e.g. the Spanish- 
English Collins Dictionary, Figure 4) or of other 
MT dictionaries that have been restructured 
according to Temple own dictionary structure. 
partial glossary entries and is then loaded in the 
lexical database. The translator can then use the 
glossary editor (Figure 5) to edit any entry flagged 
as incomplete. Using the glossary editor, the 
translator can also access bilingual dictionaries and 
use a variety of corpus-aytalysis tools, including a 
key word in context (KWIC) utility and a 
concordance tool. 
Semi-automatic development of glossaries 
The availability of a large glossary is the key for 
good quality translations. The Temple Translator's 
Workstation provides the MT developer with tools 
to semi-antomatically build glossaries. These tools 
work on large tagged corpora and use statistics on 
co-occurrence of words in a given corpus to extract 
phrase patterns. 
The translator uses a phrase extraction utility to 
build a list of recurring patterns of words in a 
corpus (Ngrams). This list is formatted as a list of 
1. See for examole \[Guthrie t al. 93a, Guthfie et al 
93b, Stein et al 93\]. 
The glossary is clearly dependent on the kind of 
text included in the corpus being used. but 
dependency on a particular domain and type of text 
is a natural limitation of machine-translation 
systems, and a GBMT is no exception. However, 
building a small size glossary, such as the Arabic- 
English glossary which contains approximately 
10,000 entries, is a relatively easy and fast task. The 
Arabic-English glossary, for example, was built in 
six man/months. Moreover, it is fairly easy to 
enhance the glossary when new texts are being 
processed: these new texts can be added to the 
corpus and the corpus can be processed again to 
provide a new list of potential glossary entries. The 
104 
translator can, of course, manually add any phrase to the glossary.

Conclusion References 
The Temple Translator's Workstation has been 
developed in C within a two-year project at CRL. 
The project has provided valuable results and 
insights for the development of a flexible 
multUingual platform for Natural Language 
Processing. Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries 
have been developed for Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, 
and Russian. The project has produced a working 
multillngual Translator's Workstation prototype 
with complete machine translation functions for 
Spanish, Arabic, and Japanese to English, and sc~ne 
Russian morphological nalysis. It has also resulted 
in the development of a language and tool 
integration methodology that facilitates the process 
of developing a new machine-translation system 
and integrating it in a translator's working 
envkonment. The translations produced answer the 
need for fast multilingual machine translation 
capabilities as required in information processing 
environments because the linguistic omponents of
the system are derived from the very texts 
undergoing translation and analysis in the system.
