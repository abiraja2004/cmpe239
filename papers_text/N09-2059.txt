Abstract
Word sense distributions are usually skewed.
Predicting the extent of the skew can help a
word sense disambiguation (WSD) system de-
termine whether to consider evidence from the
local context or apply the simple yet effec-
tive heuristic of using the first (most frequent)
sense. In this paper, we propose a method to
estimate the entropy of a sense distribution to
boost the precision of a first sense heuristic by
restricting its application to words with lower
entropy. We show on two standard datasets
that automatic prediction of entropy can in-
crease the performance of an automatic first
sense heuristic.
1 Introduction
Word sense distributions are typically skewed and
WSD systems do best when they exploit this ten-
dency. This is usually done by estimating the most
frequent sense (MFS) for each word from a training
corpus and using that sense as a back-off strategy for
a word when there is no convincing evidence from
the context. This is known as the MFS heuristic 1
and is very powerful since sense distributions are
usually skewed. The heuristic becomes particularly
hard to beat for words with highly skewed sense dis-
tributions (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002). Although
the MFS can be estimated from tagged corpora, there
are always cases where there is insufficient data, or
where the data is inappropriate, for example because
1It is also referred to as the first sense heuristic in the WSD
literature and in this paper.
it comes from a very different domain. This has mo-
tivated some recent work attempting to estimate the
distributions automatically (McCarthy et al, 2004;
Lapata and Keller, 2007). This paper examines the
case for determining the skew of a word sense distri-
bution by estimating entropy and then using this to
increase the precision of an unsupervised first sense
heuristic by restricting application to those words
where the system can automatically detect that it has
the most chance. We use a method based on that
proposed by McCarthy et al (2004) as this approach
does not require hand-labelled corpora. The method
could easily be adapted to other methods for predic-
ing predominant sense.
2 Method
Given a listing of senses from an inventory, the
method proposed by McCarthy et al (2004) pro-
vides a prevalence ranking score to produce a MFS
heuristic. We make a slight modification to Mc-
Carthy et al?s prevalence score and use it to es-
timate the probability distribution over the senses
of a word. We use the same resources as Mc-
Carthy et al (2004): a distributional similarity the-
saurus and a WordNet semantic similarity measure.
The thesaurus was produced using the metric de-
scribed by Lin (1998) with input from the gram-
matical relation data extracted using the 90 mil-
lion words of written English from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992) using the RASP
parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002). The thesaurus
consists of entries for each word (w) with the top
50 ?nearest neighbours? to w, where the neighbours
are words ranked by the distributional similarity that
233
they share with w. The WordNet similarity score
is obtained with the jcn measure (Jiang and Con-
rath, 1997) using the WordNet Similarity Package
0.05 (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003) and WordNet
version 1.6. The jcn measure needs word frequency
information, which we obtained from the BNC.
2.1 Estimates of Predominance, Probability
and Entropy
Following McCarthy et al (2004), we calculate
prevalence of each sense of the word (w) using a
weighted sum of the distributional similarity scores
of the top 50 neighbours of w. The sense of w that
has the highest value is the automatically detected
MFS (predominant sense). The weights are deter-
mined by the WordNet similarity between the sense
in question and the neighbour. We make a modi-
fication to the original method by multiplying the
weight by the inverse rank of the neighbour from
the list of 50 neighbours. This modification magni-
fies the contribution to each sense depending on the
rank of the neighbour while still allowing a neigh-
bour to contribute to all senses that it relates too.
We verified the effect of this change compared to the
original ranking score by measuring cross-entropy. 2
Let Nw = n1,n2 . . .nk denote the ordered set of the
top k = 50 neighbours of w according to the distri-
butional similarity thesaurus, senses(w) is the set of
senses of w and dss(w,n j) is the distributional sim-
ilarity score of a word w and its jth neighbour. Let
wsi be a sense of w then wnss(wsi,n j) is the maxi-
mum WordNet similarity score between wsi and the
WordNet sense of the neighbour (n j) that maximises
this score. The prevalence score is calculated as fol-
lows with 1rankn j being our modification to McCarthyet al
Prevalence Score(wsi) = ?n j?Nw dss(w,n j)?
wnss(wsi,n j)
?wsi??senses(w)wnss(wsi? ,n j)
? 1rankn j
(1)
To turn this score into a probability estimate we sum
the scores over all senses of a word and the proba-
bility for a sense is the original score divided by this
sum:
2Our modified version of the score gave a lower cross-
entropy with SemCor compared to that in McCarthy et al The
result was highly significant with p < 0.01 on the t-test.
p?(wsi) = prevalence score(wsi)?ws j?w prevalence score(ws j)
(2)
To smooth the data, we evenly distribute 1/10 of the
smallest prevalence score to all senses with a unde-
fined prevalence score values. Entropy is measured
as:
H(senses(w)) =? ?
wsi?senses(w)
p(wsi)log(p(wsi))
using our estimate (p?) for the probability distribu-
tion p over the senses of w.
3 Experiments
We conducted two experiments to evaluate the ben-
efit of using our estimate of entropy to restrict appli-
cation of the MFS heuristic. The two experiments
are conducted on the polysemous nouns in SemCor
and the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English all words
task (we will refer to this as SE2-EAW).
3.1 SemCor
For this experiment we used all the polysemous
nouns in Semcor 1.6 (excluding multiwords and
proper nouns). We depart slightly from (McCarthy
et al, 2004) in including all polysemous nouns
whereas they limited the experiment to those with
a frequency in SemCor of 3 or more and where there
is one sense with a higher frequency than the others.
Table 1 shows the precision of finding the predomi-
nant sense using equation 1 with respect to different
entropy thresholds. At each threshold, the MFS in
Semcor provides the upper-bound (UB). The random
baseline (RBL) is computed by selecting one of the
senses of the target word randomly as the predomi-
nant sense. As we hypothesized, precision is higher
when the entropy of the sense distribution is lower,
which is an encouraging result given that the entropy
is automatically estimated. The performance of the
random baseline is higher at lower entropy which
shows that the task is easier and involves a lower de-
gree of polysemy of the target words. However, the
gains over the random baseline are greater at lower
entropy levels indicating that the merits of detect-
ing the skew of the distribution cannot all be due to
lower polysemy levels.

Table 2: Precision (P) of equation 1 on SemCor with re-
spect to frequency and polysemy
We also conducted a frequency and polysemy
analysis shown in Table 2 to demonstrate that the
increase in precision is not all due to frequency or
polysemy. This is important, since both frequency
and polysemy level (assuming a predefined sense in-
ventory) could be obtained without the need for au-
tomatic estimation. As we can see, while precision
is higher for lower polysemy, the automatic estimate
of entropy can provide a greater increase in preci-
sion than polysemy, and frequency does not seem to
be strongly correlated with precision.
3.2 SENSEVAL-2 English All Words Dataset
The SE2-EAW task provides a hand-tagged test suite
of 5,000 words of running text from three articles
from the Penn Treebank II (Palmer et al, 2001).
Again, we examine whether precision of the MFS

heuristic can be increased by restricting application
depending on entropy. We use the same resources as
for the SemCor experiment. 3 Table 3 gives the re-
sults. The most frequent sense (MFS) from SE2-EAW
itself provides the upper-bound (UB). We also com-
pare performance with the Semcor MFS (SC). Per-
formance is close to the Semcor MFS while not re-
lying on any manual tagging. As before, precision
increases significantly for words with low estimated
entropy, and the gains over the random baseline are
higher compared to the gains including all words.
4 Related Work
There is promising related work on determining the
predominant sense for a MFS heuristic (Lapata and
Keller, 2007; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006) but our
work is the first to use the ranking score to estimate
entropy and apply it to determine the confidence in
the MFS heuristic. It is likely that these methods
would also have increased precision if the ranking
scores were used to estimate entropy. We leave such
investigations for further work.
Chan and Ng (2005) estimate word sense distri-
butions and demonstrate that sense distribution esti-
mation improves a supervised WSD classifier. They
use three sense distribution methods, including that
of McCarthy et al (2004). While the other two
methods outperform the McCarthy et al method,
3We also used a tool for mapping from WordNet 1.7 to
WordNet 1.6 (Daude? et al, 2000) to map the SE2-EAW noun
data (originally distributed with 1.7 sense numbers) to 1.6 sense
numbers.

they rely on parallel training data and are not appli-
cable on 9.6% of the test data for which there are
no training examples. Our method does not require
parallel training data.
Agirre and Mart??nez (2004) show that sense dis-
tribution estimation is very important for both super-
vised and unsupervised WSD. They acquire tagged
examples on a large scale by querying Google with
monosemous synonyms of the word senses in ques-
tion. They show that the method of McCarthy et
al. (2004) can be used to produce a better sampling
technique than relying on the bias from web data
or randomly selecting the same number of exam-
ples for each sense. Our work similarly shows that
the automatic MFS is an unsupervised alternative to
SemCor but our work does not focus on sampling
but on an estimation of confidence in an automatic
MFS heuristic.
5 Conclusions
We demonstrate that our variation of the McCarthy
et al (2004) method for finding a MFS heuristic can
be used for estimating the entropy of a sense dis-
tribution which can be exploited to boost precision.
Words which are estimated as having lower entropy
in general get higher precision. This suggests that
automatic estimation of entropy is a good criterion
for getting higher precision. This is in agreement
with Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000) who demon-
strate that entropy is a good measure of the difficulty
of WSD tasks, though their measure of entropy was
taken from the gold-standard distribution itself.
As future work, we want to compare this approach
of estimating entropy with other methods for es-
timating sense distributions which do not require
hand-labelled data or parallel texts. Currently, we
disregard local context. We wish to couple the con-
fidence in the MFS with contextual evidence and in-
vestigate application on coarse-grained datasets.
