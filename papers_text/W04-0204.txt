Abstract 
In this paper we describe the (annotation) tools underly-
ing two automatic techniques to analyse the meaning 
and use of backward causal connectives in large Dutch 
newspaper corpora. With the help of these techniques, 
Latent Semantic Analysis and Thematic Text Analysis, 
the contexts of more than 14,000 connectives were stud-
ied. We will focus here on the methods of analysis and 
on the fairly straightforward (annotation) tools needed 
to perform the semantic analyses, i.e. POS-tagging, lem-
matisation and a thesaurus-like thematic dictionary. 
1 Introduction 
In ongoing work, we explore the possibility to 
make use of large corpora to test hypotheses con-
cerning linguistic factors determining the meaning 
and use of connectives. Of course, corpus-based 
approaches of connectives are not new, but classi-
cally they consist of either fully analysed but rela-
tively small corpora, or of large corpora of which a 
random set is analysed. The reason for this quanti-
tative restriction is clear: The data-analyses are 
completely hand-based.  While these empirical 
studies are useful from a qualitative point of view, 
they all suffer from the same quantitative draw-
back, namely the relatively small number of data 
(rarely more than 100 occurrences are analysed, 
mostly only 50).  In addition, most of these analy-
ses are still too analyst-dependent, making gener-
alizations and replications difficult. Changing this 
situation includes handling exhaustively large cor-
pora (with hundreds and even thousands of occur-
rences of the same linguistic phenomenon) and 
implementing the analytic procedures to make 
them analyst-independent. In this paper, we test 
such a methodology for which we used a number 
of linguistic hypotheses found in the literature on 
the semantics of causal connectives and tried to 
replicate the results. The linguistic material we 
worked on are four Dutch backward causal con-
nectives: aangezien ('since'), doordat ('because of 
the fact that'), omdat ('because') and, want ('be-
cause'). This choice was motivated by the fact that 
there has already been quite some linguistic work 
on this topic, mainly empirically based (Degand, 
2001; Degand and Pander Maat, 2003; Pit, 2003).1 
We have shown elsewhere how linguistic hypothe-
ses concerning the scaling of these connectives in 
terms of subjectivity and their thematic behaviour 
could be supported (Bestgen et al, 2003). Since 
these first results are very encouraging, we would 
like to focus here on the methods of automatic 
analysis ? Latent Semantic Analysis and Thematic 
Text Analysis - and on the fairly straightforward 
(annotation) tools needed to perform the semantic 
analyses, i.e. POS-tagging, lemmatisation and a 
thesaurus-like thematic dictionary. We illustrate 
how the combination of the two techniques of 
automatic analysis permit to gain deeper insight 
into the semantic constraints on the use of the con-
nectives studied. Doing so, we test a number of 
new hypotheses concerning the perspectivizing and 
polyphonic nature of connectives that remain un-
confirmed in the linguistic literature. We also dis-
cuss the robustness of the techniques and their re-
usability in other contexts and other languages.

 For lack of space we will not present the linguistic analyses here but will 
consider them as given. 
2 Techniques and Tools 
The techniques used have to fulfil two tasks: they 
are needed to extract the relevant linguistic mate-
rial from the corpus, that is to say the four connec-
tives with their context of use; and they are used to 
analyse the retrieved elements in order to test a 
number of linguistic hypotheses concerning the 
meaning and use of these connectives.  Our main 
objective is to show that with the use of these tech-
niques only fairly straightforward annotation tools 
are needed to perform quite profound semantic 
analyses on massive quantitative data. 
2.1 POS-Tagging and the identification of 
the causal segments 
The extraction of the relevant linguistic material 
was fulfilled by automatic syntactic analysis tech-
niques. As a basis for our analyses we worked with 
the first six months of a Dutch newspaper corpus 
of more than 30 million words2. This material was 
POS-tagged using MBT (Memory Based Tagger) 
(Daelemans et al,1996). We then discarded the 
items with few content words: sports results, tele-
vision programs, crosswords and puzzles, stock 
exchange reports, service information from the 
newspaper editor, etc. We also ?cleaned? the cor-
pus material of irregularities caused by the incom-
patibility between the source file and the tagging 
program (mostly nonsense words generated by the 
program). This eventually led to a data set of ap-
proximately 16,500,000 words.  
The POS-tagging permitted to segment the cor-
pus in sentences and to label the words grammati-
cally.  Second, POS-tagging allowed us to locate 
and extract the connectives from the sentences in 
which they occurred. Concretely, we extracted all 
sentence-length segments on the basis of the tag 
<UT> (?utterance?). We then did a search on the 
four connectives tagged as <conj> by the parser.   
Table 1 displays the frequencies of the retrieved 
connectives. These figures do not include a number 
of sentences that were eliminated because they 
were potentially problematic for the analysis. This 
was for instance the case for sentences containing 
more than one connective out of our list of four.3

 We used the year 1997 of "De Volkskrant" a Dutch national daily newspaper. 
The corpus is distributed on CD-rom.

 These cases were eliminated in order to be sure of the exact influence of the 
connective and about the exact contribution of  the context.

Table 1: Frequencies of the causal connectives in the 
data set 
The extracted sentences were then analysed in 
terms of a series of heuristics to identify the CAUSE 
(P) and CONSEQUENCE segments (Q)4.  From a 
syntactic point of view, the connectives doordat, 
omdat and aangezien can occur in two basic types 
of causal constructions: medial (Q CONNECTIVE P), 
see example (1), and preposed ones (CONNECTIVE 
P, Q), see example (2).  The connective want only 
appears in medial constructions.   
(1) Een gezamenlijk beleid is 
nodig omdat in het najaar 
in het Japanse Kyoto 
wereldwijd wordt onderhan-
deld over het klimaat. 
?A common policy is necessary 
because worldwide negotia-
tions will take place in the 
autumn in the Japanese city 
of Kyoto.? 
(2) Iedere strenge winter 
heeft gevolgen voor de 
kerkorgels', zegt dr. A.J. 
Gierveld van de Gerefor-
meerde Organisten-
vereniging. Doordat het

quences for the church or-
gans?, Dr. A.J. Gierveld of 
the Reformed Organists Union 
says. Because the wood 
shrinks, crocks may show, 
through which air escapes.? 
 
The heuristics to identify the CAUSE (P) and 
CONSEQUENCE (Q) segments were primarily based 
on

 The connectives under investigation are all so-called backward causal connec-
tives, i.e. they express an underlying causal relation of the type CONSEQUENCE ? 
CAUSE, in which the connective introduces the CAUSE segment.   
a) the position of the connective in the 
sentence (number and type of words 
preceding the connective),  
b) the number, position and order of finite 
verbs in the segment,  
c) the presence or absence of punctuation 
markers, especially commas.  
For example, a sentence beginning with the con-
nective omdat can either be preposed (P-Q) (ex-
ample 3), or medial (Q-P), if Q and P are given in 
different sentences (example 4).  
(3) Omdat de verdachte niet 
eerder was veroordeeld, 
bleef de gevangenisstraf 
geheel voorwaardelijk. 
?Because the suspect had not 
been convicted before, the 
sentence was entirely proba-
tional.? 
(4) Maar er zijn meer pro-
gramma's die de moeite 
waard zijn en die toch 
niet worden bekeken. Omdat

de ramsj. 
?But there are more [TV] pro-
grammes that are worth watch-
ing and still are not being 
watched. Because they are 
hard to trace among the rub-
bish.? 
 
To extract these segments correctly, a number of 
rules enter into play. For example,  
 
a) If CONN = omdat, doordat or aangezien; and 
b) If CONN in initial position, look for first fi-
nite verb [vf], if vf appears in segment 
<?vf, vf ?> or <? vf vf ?>,  then cut be-
fore second vf, and segment containing 
CONN is P, the other one is Q. 
c) If CONN in initial position and there is only 
one vf, then segment containing CONN is P, 
and previous sentence is Q. 
Other rules are used to determine whether the 
CONN is in initial position or not. In addition to 
examples (2-3), example (5) also illustrates a case 
of initial connective, even though a word precedes 
the connective.  
(5) En omdat in Nederland de 
voertaal nog steeds het 
Nederlands is, worden de 
meeste schoolvakken ook in 
die taal gedoceerd. 
?And because Dutch is still 
the main language in the 
Netherlands, most subjects 
are taught in that language.? 
 
This resulted in 21 heuristic rules, the adequacy of 
which was hand-checked on large samples of the 
data. In the end, 1.4% of the data were lost because 
one of the segments was missing or because none 
of the procedures could work out the identification 
of P and Q.  Ultimately  we were able to identify 
the causal segments for 14181 sentences. Four syn-
tactic environments can be distinguished, involving 
a preposed construction <Conn P Q.> as in exam-
ples (2, 3, 5) above, and three types of medial con-
structions:  
a)  <Q conn P.> corresponds to a construction 
in which Q and P are linked by a connective 
within the same sentence (example 1);  
b) <Q. Conn P.> corresponds to constructions 
in which the previous sentence functions as 
Q (examples 4); and  
c) <Prev. Q conn P.> corresponds to construc-
tions for which the Q-segment is anaphoric 
with the preceding sentence, thus requiring 
this previous sentence for the semantic in-
terpretation, as in example (6), in which the 
Q ?dat komt? (litt. ?that comes?) picks up the 
semantic information from the previous sen-
tence and links it to the P-segment intro-
duced by the connective. 
(6) De Europese economie 
raakt hopeloos achterop 
bij de Amerikaanse en 
Japanse. Dat komt door-
dat Europa niet meedoet 
op nieuwe groeimarkten. 
?The European economy is 
falling hopelessly behind 
the American and Japanese 
economy. This is because 
Europe is not participating 
in new growth markets.? 
 
Actually, only 7.1% of the sentences investigated 
belong to the preposed construction type. How-
ever, important divergences exist between the con-
nectives: want is never used in preposed position, 
omdat in 10.41% of the cases, and doordat in 
14.32% of the cases, a figure which rises to 43.5% 
of the cases for aangezien. It is interesting to point 
out that this is in total agreement with previous 
small-scale corpus research on this matter. 
2.2 Lemmatisation and the construction of 
the LSA semantic space 
The first automatic technique that will be presented 
is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a mathematical 
technique for extracting a very large ?semantic 
space? from large text corpora on the basis of the 
statistical analysis of the set of co-occurrences in a 
text corpus. Landauer et al (1998) stress that this 
technique can be viewed from two sides.  At a 
theoretical level, it is meant to be used to develop 
simulations of the cognitive processes running dur-
ing language comprehension, including, for in-
stance, a computational model of metaphor 
treatment (Kintsch, 2000 ; Lemaire et al, 2001), 
but also to analyse the coherence of texts (Foltz et 
al., 1998 ; Pi?rard et al, 2004). At a more applied 
level, it is a technique which enables to infer and to 
represent the meaning of words on the basis of 
their actual use in text so that the similarity of the 
meaning of words, sentences or paragraphs can be 
estimated (Bestgen, 2002; Choi et al, 2001). It is 
this latter aspect which draws our attention here. 
The point of departure of the analysis is a lexical 
table (Lebart and Salem, 1992) containing the fre-
quencies of every word in each of the documents 
included in the text material, a document being a 
text, a paragraph, or a sentence. To derive semantic 
relations between words from the lexical table the 
analysis of mere co-occurrences will not do,  the 
major problem being that even in a large corpus 
most words are relatively rare.  Consequently the 
co-occurrences of words are even rarer.  This fact 
makes such co-occurrences very sensitive to arbi-
trary variations (Burgess et al, 1998 ; Kintsch, 
2001).  LSA resolves this problem by replacing the 
original frequency table by an approximation pro-
ducing a kind of smoothening effect on the asso-
ciations. To this end, the frequency table 
undergoes a singular value decomposition and it is 
then recomposed on the basis of only a fraction of 
the information it contains. Thus, the thousands of 
words from the documents have been substituted 
by linear combinations or ?semantic dimensions? 
with respect to which the original words can be 
situated again. Contrary to a classical factor analy-
sis the extracted dimensions are very numerous 
and non-interpretable.   
All original words and segments can then be 
placed into this semantic space. The meaning of 
each word is represented by a vector, thus indicat-
ing the exact location of the word in this multidi-
mensional semantic space. To calculate the 
semantic proximity between two words, the cosine 
between the two vectors that represent them is cal-
culated.  The more two words are semantically 
similar, the more their vectors point in the same 
direction, and consequently, the closer their cosine 
will be to 1 (coinciding vectors).  A cosine of 0 
shows an absence of similarity, since the corre-
sponding vectors point in orthogonal directions.  It 
is also possible to calculate the similarity between 
?higher order? elements, i.e. between sentences, 
paragraphs, and entire documents, or combinations 
of those, even if this higher order element isn?t by 
itself an analysed element. The vector in question 
corresponds to the centroid of the words compos-
ing the segment under investigation.  The centroid 
results from the weighted sum of the vectors of 
these words (Deerwester et al, 1990). This makes 
it possible to calculate the semantic proximity be-
tween any two sentences, viz. whether present in 
the original corpus or not, whether the original 
corpus had been segmented in sentence length 
documents or not.  
To perform the LSA analyses, we used the 
Dutch newspaper corpus to build the semantic 
space. To this end, the data set, which had been 
lemmatised with MBLEM (Memory Based Lem-
matiser) (Van den Bosch & Daelemans, 1999), was 
cut into article-length segments.  Elimination of all 
digits, special characters, punctuation marks, and 
of a list of 222 stopwords (words occurring in 
?any? context, like determiners, auxiliaries, con-
junctions, ?), brought the total number of words 
back to approximately 6.5 million. For the input 
lexical table, the documents were articles of mini-
mally 24 words and maximally 523 words, i.e. all 
articles minus the 10% shortest and minus the 10% 
longest ones. As to the words, we kept all those 
that occurred at least ten times in the data set. 
Overall this resulted in a matrix of 36630 terms in 
28640 documents.  To build the semantic space 
proper, the singular value decomposition was real-
ized with the program SVDPACKC (Berry, 1992; 
Berry et al, 1993), and the 300 first singular vec-
tors were retained.  In the present research we will 
use this technique to evaluate the semantic prox-
imity between P& Q, and between the causal seg-
ments and the prior or subsequent sentences.  
2.3 Dictionaries and lexical categorisation 
The second technique used to test the linguistic 
hypotheses is alternatively called ?word count 
strategy? (Pennebaker et al, 2003), automatic iden-
tification of linguistic features (Biber, 1988) or 
thematic text analysis (Popping, 2000; Stone, 
1997), the aim of which is to determine whether 
some categories of words (e.g., words of opinion, 
fact, attitude, etc.) or some grammatical categories 
(e.g. personal pronouns) occur more often in a 
given type of text segment. The first step in this 
kind of analysis is to build a dictionary that con-
tains the categories to be investigated and the cor-
responding (lemmatised) lexical entries that signal 
their occurrence. The categories may correspond to 
grammatical classes, but also to thematic word 
grouping. The following step consists in searching 
all the text segments containing these lexical en-
tries in order to account for the frequency of each 
category in each text segment. These data are put 
into a matrix that has one row for each text seg-
ment and one column for each category, each cell 
containing the frequency of the respective category 
in the respective text segment. Finally, this matrix 
is analysed to determine whether some categories 
occur more often in a given type of text segment. 
To illustrate this technique, let us assume that we 
want to test the hypothesis that (nominative) per-
sonal pronouns occur more frequent in text seg-
ments connected by want than by the other 
backward causal connectives. In the first step the 
"Personal-Pronoun" dictionary is built, containing 
the corresponding lexical entries: ik, jij, je, hij, zij, 
ze, wij, we, jullie, u. All the text segments contain-
ing these lexical entries are then searched in order 
to account for the frequency of the concept "Per-
sonal-Pronoun" in each text segment. These data 
are put into a matrix which is analysed to deter-
mine whether the concept "Personal-Pronoun" oc-
curs more often with want-segments than with the 
other causal segments.  
The two main difficulties we are confronted 
with when using this technique in the present stud-
ies are (i) the reduced size of the analysed text 
segments (one sentence or even less), and (ii) the 
difficulty, or even impossibility, to build an ex-
haustive list of words belonging to a category like 
fact, opinion, attitude, etc. With respect to the first 
difficulty, we believe that the reduced size of the 
segments will be compensated by the large number 
of segments of each type being analysed.  The sec-
ond difficulty is addressed below where we pro-
pose a number of ways to extend the category lists 
automatically.  
3 Combining LSA and TTA: an applica-
tion 
3.1 Perspective shift 
There are a number of claims in the literature that 
some connectives co-occur with perspective shifts 
between the causal segments, while others do not. 
Perspectivisation accounts for the fact that there 
are more sources of information than the speaker 
alone. In relation to our connectives, perspectivisa-
tion has been claimed to play a role in the meaning 
differences between want (introducing a perspec-
tive shift) and omdat (no perspective shift). How-
ever, the various corpus studies on this matter have 
not univocally confirmed this hypothesis (Degand, 
2001; Oversteegen, 1997).  We would like to ex-
plore this matter further by comparing the semantic 
tightness of the segments related by our connec-
tives.  This will be done by calculating the seman-
tic proximity between Q and P for each of the 
connectives. Our hypotheses are as follows: 
Hypothesis 1: The cosine between Q and P re-
lated by monophonic connectives (omdat) 
should be higher than the cosine between Q and 
P related by polyphonic connectives (want). 
Hypothesis 2: The cosine between the prior sen-
tence and the subsequent sentence should be 
higher for monophonic connectives than for 
polyphonic connectives.

Table 2: Mean Cosine per connective between the 
causal segments, and between the prior and subsequent 
sentences 
 
Table 2 displays the cosines resulting from the 
LSA-analysis. Two ANOVAs  were performed. 
The first one had the connectives as independent 
variable and the semantic proximity between the 
causal segments as dependent variable. It shows 
that hypothesis 1 is borne out (F(3, 10505) = 
11.36, p < 0.0001): the causal segments related by 
the (monophonic) connective omdat are semanti-
cally closer than the segments related by the (poly-
phonic) connective want.  The results furthermore 
show that doordat and aangezien should be de-
scribed in terms of  monophonic connectives.  The 
second ANOVA, with the connectives as inde-
pendent variable and the semantic proximity be-
tween the prior and subsequent sentences as 
dependent variable, confirms hypothesis 2 (F(3, 
10505) = 25.75, p < 0.0001): the monophonic con-
nectives aangezien, doordat and omdat go along 
with topic continuity (or at least semantic prox-
imity) between the prior and subsequent sentence 
to the causal construction, while this is less the 
case for the connective want.  
To confirm that these results are indeed related 
to the issue of perspectivisation, this LSA-analysis 
was completed with a thematic text analysis to test 
for the presence vs. absence of perspective indica-
tors. To this end we built a "Perspective" diction-
ary of perspective-indicating elements (Spooren, 
1989) such as intensifiers, emphasisers, attitudinal 
nouns and adjuncts, etc. (Caenepeel, 1989). The 
dictionary was composed of two subcategories: 
a) communication markers, like (non-
ambiguous) verbs and adverbs of saying 
and thinking, e.g. report, tell, confirm, re-
quire,  according to,? 
b) markers of the speaker's attitude, like lin-
guistic elements expressing an expectation 
or a denial of expectation, intensifiers and 
attitudinals, and evaluative words, e.g. 
probably, must, horrible, fantastic, ?  
To build the dictionary, we used a Dutch thesaurus 
(Brouwers, 1997) and extracted all (unambiguous) 
lemmas corresponding to one of the above-
mentioned categories.  Multi-word expressions or 
separable verbs were not included in the lists. The 
lists were composed on two native speaker's 
judgements with a good knowledge of the litera-
ture on perspectivisation.  
The idea of the thematic text analysis was to 
confirm that the break in semantic tightness occur-
ring with want-segments, as revealed by the LSA-
analysis, could indeed be interpreted in terms of a 
perspective shift.  We would therefore expect that 
the causal segments related by the connective want 
show diverging perspectivisation patterns, and that 
this will not be the case for the segments related by 
omdat, doordat, aangezien. This is reformulated in 
hypothesis 3. 
Hypothesis 3:  If the causal segments are re-
lated by the connective want, the Q-segment 
contains perspective signals, the P-segment 
does not.  The causal segments related by the 
connectives omdat, doordat, aangezien do not 
present such a shift.

Table 3: Mean number of perspective markers in P & Q  
 
The results displayed in Table 3 show that the hy-
pothesis is borne out for the subcategory of attitu-
dinal markers: want-segments display a higher 
amount of attitudinal markers in Q than in P (F(1, 
5588) = 26.84, p < 0.0001). For the other connec-
tives this is not the case. For the communication 
markers, the hypothesis is not borne out.  Actually, 
only omdat displays a higher amount of communi-
cation markers in Q (F(1, 6746) = 6.53, p < 0.01).  
While this latter result might seem counter to ex-
pectation, it actually goes in the direction of prior 
observations that omdat-relations frequently dis-
play the explicit introduction of speech acts (De-
gand, 2001; Pit 2003). 
All together, these results offer new interesting 
insights into the discourse environment of (Dutch) 
causal connectives.  On the one hand, we have 
shown with the LSA analysis that the proximity 
between Q and P is lower for want-relations than 
for the other connectives and that this is also the 
case for the semantic proximity between the sen-
tences prior and subsequent to the causal relations.  
We therefore concluded that the connective want is 
a marker of  thematic shift.  On the other hand, the 
TTA analysis revealed that the Q-segments in 
want-relations display a higher amount of attitudi-
nal markers. In our view, the presence of these 
markers leads to the conclusion that the connective 
want is indeed a marker of perspective shift, i.e. 
the break in semantic tightness should be inter-
preted as a perspective break, as has often been 
suggested in the literature. Furthermore, the addi-
tional results for want (absence of communication 
markers in Q) also suggest that markers expressing 
the speaker's attitude should be clearly distin-
guished from those that explicit the speaker's 
speech act (verbs of saying) or designate him/her 
explicitly as the source of the speech act (adverbs 
like aldus, volgens, ? 'according to'). 
The polyphony/monophony distinction overlaps 
with the coordination/subordination distinction 
between want vs. the other connectives.  The ques-
tion arises which of those two factors is responsi-
ble for the results obtained.  One route to follow is 
to compare our results with a language like English 
in which a same connective (because) has both 
monophonic and polyphonic uses, or with a lan-
guage like French where a polyphonic connective 
like puisque is subordinating. The latter topic is 
object of ongoing research. 
4 Discussion 
In this paper we have presented a method for the 
linguistic investigation of a discourse phenomenon, 
viz. connectives, giving very satisfying results 
without necessitating heavy, work-intensive (hand-
based) discourse annotation.  The research pre-
sented is important to the corpus study of discourse 
phenomena for a number of reasons. The first is 
that it makes it possible to test linguistic hypothe-
ses about the use of causal connectives on a large 
scale basis, whereas previous tests were based on 
only small corpora and small amount of data. The 
second is that the analysis is mostly fully auto-
matic, especially with respect to the coding of the 
fragments. It is especially this latter feature that 
should appeal to the linguistic community, and 
makes our method more robust. The intercoder 
reliability is a constant concern of everyone work-
ing with corpora to test linguistic hypotheses (Car-
letta, 1996), and the more so when one is coding 
for semanto-pragmatic interpretations, as in the 
case of the analysis of connectives. A third reason 
is that our method combines two techniques of 
automatic text analysis, which allows us to formu-
late our hypotheses to be tested more fine-grained 
than possible with either one separately. Moreover, 
hypothesis formulation and testing goes further: 
We can use the methodology to formulate new hy-
potheses. An interesting possibility is to use LSA 
to find neighbours of terms in the dictionary, thus 
extending the dictionary. A further interesting 
venue is to test the linguistic hypotheses for differ-
ent genres. This brings us to a further possibility, 
namely to reuse the semantic space for different 
types of linguistic research. A final possibility is to 
use the present semantic space for comparative 
research: How do the present results compare to a 
similar analysis of French connectives?
