Abstract
Previous research has shown that the mean-
ing of many noun-noun compounds N
1
N

can be approximated reasonably well by
paraphrasing clauses of the form ?N
2
that
. . . N
1
?, where ?. . . ? stands for a verb
with or without a preposition. For exam-
ple, malaria mosquito is a ?mosquito that
carries malaria?. Evaluating the quality of
such paraphrases is the theme of Task 9 at
SemEval-2010. This paper describes some
background, the task definition, the process
of data collection and the task results. We
also venture a few general conclusions be-
fore the participating teams present their
systems at the SemEval-2010 workshop.
There were 5 teams who submitted 7 sys-
tems.
1 Introduction
Noun compounds (NCs) are sequences of two or
more nouns that act as a single noun,1 e.g., stem
cell, stem cell research, stem cell research organi-
zation, etc. Lapata and Lascarides (2003) observe
that NCs pose syntactic and semantic challenges for
three basic reasons: (1) the compounding process
is extremely productive in English; (2) the seman-
tic relation between the head and the modifier is
implicit; (3) the interpretation can be influenced by
contextual and pragmatic factors. Corpus studies
have shown that while NCs are very common in
English, their frequency distribution follows a Zip-
fian or power-law distribution and the majority of
NCs encountered will be rare types (Tanaka and
Baldwin, 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2003; Bald-
win and Tanaka, 2004; ?O S?eaghdha, 2008). As a
consequence, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

We follow the definition in (Downing, 1977).
applications cannot afford either to ignore NCs or
to assume that they can be handled by relying on a
dictionary or other static resource.
Trouble with lexical resources for NCs notwith-
standing, NC semantics plays a central role in com-
plex knowledge discovery and applications, includ-
ing but not limited to Question Answering (QA),
Machine Translation (MT), and Information Re-
trieval (IR). For example, knowing the (implicit)
semantic relation between the NC components can
help rank and refine queries in QA and IR, or select
promising translation pairs in MT (Nakov, 2008a).
Thus, robust semantic interpretation of NCs should
be of much help in broad-coverage semantic pro-
cessing.
Proposed approaches to modelling NC seman-
tics have used semantic similarity (Nastase and Sz-
pakowicz, 2003; Moldovan et al, 2004; Kim and
Baldwin, 2005; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2006;
Girju, 2007; ?O S?eaghdha and Copestake, 2007)
and paraphrasing (Vanderwende, 1994; Kim and
Baldwin, 2006; Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov
and Hearst, 2008). The former body of work seeks
to measure the similarity between known and un-
seen NCs by considering various features, usually
context-related. In contrast, the latter group uses
verb semantics to interpret NCs directly, e.g., olive
oil as ?oil that is extracted from olive(s)?, drug
death as ?death that is caused by drug(s)?, flu shot
as a ?shot that prevents flu?.
The growing popularity ? and expected direct
utility ? of paraphrase-based NC semantics has
encouraged us to propose an evaluation exercise
for the 2010 edition of SemEval. This paper gives
a bird?s-eye view of the task. Section 2 presents
its objective, data, data collection, and evaluation
method. Section 3 lists the participating teams.
Section 4 shows the results and our analysis. In
Section 5, we sum up our experience so far.

2 Task Description
2.1 The Objective
For the purpose of the task, we focused on two-
word NCs which are modifier-head pairs of nouns,
such as apple pie or malaria mosquito. There are
several ways to ?attack? the paraphrase-based se-
mantics of such NCs.
We have proposed a rather simple problem: as-
sume that many paraphrases can be found ? perhaps
via clever Web search ? but their relevance is up in
the air. Given sufficient training data, we seek to es-
timate the quality of candidate paraphrases in a test
set. Each NC in the training set comes with a long
list of verbs in the infinitive (often with a prepo-
sition) which may paraphrase the NC adequately.
Examples of apt paraphrasing verbs: olive oil ?
be extracted from, drug death ? be caused by, flu
shot ? prevent. These lists have been constructed
from human-proposed paraphrases. For the train-
ing data, we also provide the participants with a
quality score for each paraphrase, which is a simple
count of the number of human subjects who pro-
posed that paraphrase. At test time, given a noun
compound and a list of paraphrasing verbs, a partic-
ipating system needs to produce aptness scores that
correlate well (in terms of relative ranking) with
the held out human judgments. There may be a
diverse range of paraphrases for a given compound,
some of them in fact might be inappropriate, but
it can be expected that the distribution over para-
phrases estimated from a large number of subjects
will indeed be representative of the compound?s
meaning.
2.2 The Datasets
Following Nakov (2008b), we took advantage of
the Amazon Mechanical Turk2 (MTurk) to acquire
paraphrasing verbs from human annotators. The
service offers inexpensive access to subjects for
tasks which require human intelligence. Its API
allows a computer program to run tasks easily and
collate the subjects? responses. MTurk is becoming
a popular means of eliciting and collecting linguis-
tic intuitions for NLP research; see Snow et al
(2008) for an overview and a further discussion.
Even though we recruited human subjects,
whom we required to take a qualification test,3
2
www.mturk.com
3We soon realized that we also had to offer a version of
our assignments without a qualification test (at a lower pay
rate) since very few people were willing to take a test. Overall,
data collection was time-consuming since many
annotators did not follow the instructions. We had
to monitor their progress and to send them timely
messages, pointing out mistakes. Although the
MTurk service allows task owners to accept or re-
ject individual submissions, rejection was the last
resort since it has the triply unpleasant effect of
(1) denying the worker her fee, (2) negatively af-
fecting her rating, and (3) lowering our rating as
a requester. We thus chose to try and educate our
workers ?on the fly?. Even so, we ended up with
many examples which we had to correct manu-
ally by labor-intensive post-processing. The flaws
were not different from those already described by
Nakov (2008b). Post-editing was also necessary to
lemmatize the paraphrasing verbs systematically.
Trial Data. At the end of August 2009, we
released as trial data the previously collected para-
phrase sets (Nakov, 2008b) for the Levi-250 dataset
(after further review and cleaning). This dataset
consisted of 250 noun-noun compounds form (Levi,
1978), each paraphrased by 25-30 MTurk workers
(without a qualification test).
Training Data. The training dataset was an ex-
tension of the trial dataset. It consisted of the same
250 noun-noun compounds, but the number of an-
notators per compound increased significantly. We
aimed to recruit at least 30 additional MTurk work-
ers per compound; for some compounds we man-
aged to get many more. For example, when we
added the paraphrasing verbs from the trial dataset
to the newly collected verbs, we had 131 different
workers for neighborhood bars, compared to just
50 for tear gas. On the average, we had 72.7 work-
ers per compound. Each worker was instructed
to try to produce at least three paraphrasing verbs,
so we ended up with 191.8 paraphrasing verbs per
compound, 84.6 of them being unique. See Table 1
for more details.
Test Data. The test dataset consisted of 388
noun compounds collected from two data sources:
(1) the Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) dataset;
and (2) the Lauer (1995) dataset. The former
contains 328 noun-noun compounds (there are
also a number of adjective-noun and adverb-noun
pairs), while the latter contains 266 noun-noun
compounds. Since these datasets overlap between
themselves and with the training dataset, we had
to exclude some examples. In the end, we had 388
we found little difference in the quality of work of subjects
recruited with and without the test.

unique noun-noun compounds for testing, distinct
from those used for training. We aimed for 100
human workers per testing NC, but we could only
get 68.3, with a minimum of 57 and a maximum of
96; there were 185.0 paraphrasing verbs per com-
pound, 70.9 of them being unique, which is close
to what we had for the training data.
Data format. We distribute the training data as
a raw text file. Each line has the following tab-
separated format:
NC paraphrase frequency
where NC is a noun-noun compound (e.g., ap-
ple cake, flu virus), paraphrase is a human-
proposed paraphrasing verb optionally followed
by a preposition, and frequency is the number
of annotators who proposed that paraphrase. Here
is an illustrative extract from the training dataset:
flu virus cause 38
flu virus spread 13
flu virus create 6
flu virus give 5
flu virus produce 5
...
flu virus be made up of 1
flu virus be observed in 1
flu virus exacerbate 1
The test file has a similar format, except that the
frequency is not included and the paraphrases for
each noun compound appear in random order:
...
chest pain originate
chest pain start in
chest pain descend in
chest pain be in

2.3 Evaluation
All evaluation was performed by computing an ap-
propriate measure of similarity/correlation between
system predictions and the compiled judgements of
the human annotators. We did it on a compound-by-
compound basis and averaged over all compounds
in the test dataset. Section 4 shows results for three
measures: Spearman rank correlation, Pearson cor-
relation, and cosine similarity.
Spearman Rank Correlation (?) was adopted
as the official evaluation measure for the competi-
tion. As a rank correlation statistic, it does not use
the numerical values of the predictions or human
judgements, only their relative ordering encoded
as integer ranks. For a sample of n items ranked
by two methods x and y, the rank correlation ? is
calculated as follows:
? =
n
?
x
i
y
i
? (

x
i
)(

where x
i
, y
i
are the ranks given by x and y to the
ith item, respectively. The value of ? ranges be-
tween -1.0 (total negative correlation) and 1.0 (total
positive correlation).
Pearson Correlation (r) is a standard measure
of correlation strength between real-valued vari-
ables. The formula is the same as (1), but with
x
i
, y
i
taking real values rather than rank values;
just like ?, r?s values fall between -1.0 and 1.0.
Cosine similarity is frequently used in NLP to
compare numerical vectors:
cos =

i
x
i
y
i
?

For non-negative data, the cosine similarity takes
values between 0.0 and 1.0. Pearson?s r can be
viewed as a version of the cosine similarity which
performs centering on x and y.
Baseline: To help interpret these evaluation mea-
sures, we implemented a simple baseline. A dis-
tribution over the paraphrases was estimated by

3 Participants
The task attracted five teams, one of which (UCD-
GOGGLE) submitted three runs. The participants
are listed in Table 2 along with brief system de-
scriptions; for more details please see the teams?
own description papers.
4 Results and Discussion
The task results appear in Table 3. In an evaluation
by Spearman?s ? (the official ranking measure),
the winning system was UVT-MEPHISTO, which
scored 0.450. UVT also achieved the top Pear-
son?s r score. UCD-PN is the top-scoring system
according to the cosine measure. One participant
submitted part of his results after the official dead-
line, which is marked by an asterisk.
The participants used a variety of information
sources and estimation methods. UVT-MEPHISTO
is a supervised system that uses frequency informa-
tion from the Google N-Gram Corpus and features
from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to rank candidate
paraphrases. On the other hand, UCD-PN uses
no external resources and no supervised training,
yet came within 0.009 of UVT-MEPHISTO in the
official evaluation. The basic idea of UCD-PN ?
that one can predict the plausibility of a paraphrase
simply by knowing which other paraphrases have
been given for that compound regardless of their
frequency ? is clearly a powerful one. Unlike the
other systems, UCD-PN used information about the
test examples (not their ranks, of course) for model
estimation; this has similarities to ?transductive?
methods for semi-supervised learning. However,
post-hoc analysis shows that UCD-PN would have
preserved its rank if it had estimated its model on
the training data only. On the other hand, if the task
had been designed differently ? by asking systems
to propose paraphrases from the set of all possi-
ble verb/preposition combinations ? then we would
not expect UCD-PN?s approach to work as well as
models that use corpus information.
The other systems are comparable to UVT-
MEPHISTO in that they use corpus frequencies
to evaluate paraphrases and apply some kind of
semantic smoothing to handle sparsity. How-
ever, UCD-GOGGLE-I, UCAM and NC-INTERP
are unsupervised systems. UCAM uses the 100-
million word BNC corpus, while the other systems
use Web-scale resources; this has presumably ex-
acerbated sparsity issues and contributed to a rela-
tively poor performance.
The hybrid approach exemplified by UCD-
GOGGLE-III combines the predictions of a sys-
tem that models paraphrase correlations and one
that learns from corpus frequencies and thus at-
tains better performance. Given that the two top-
scoring systems can also be characterized as using
these two distinct information sources, it is natu-
ral to consider combining these systems. Simply
normalizing (to unit sum) and averaging the two
sets of prediction values for each compound does

indeed give better scores: Spearman ? = 0.472,
r = 0.431, Cosine = 0.685.
The baseline from Section 2.3 turns out to be
very strong. Evaluating with Spearman?s ?, only
three systems outperform it. It is less competitive
on the other evaluation measures though. This
suggests that global paraphrase frequencies may
be useful for telling sensible paraphrases from bad
ones, but will not do for quantifying the plausibility
of a paraphrase for a given noun compound.
5 Conclusion
Given that it is a newly-proposed task, this initial
experiment in paraphrasing noun compounds has
been a moderate success. The participation rate
has been sufficient for the purposes of comparing
and contrasting different approaches to the role
of paraphrases in the interpretation of noun-noun
compounds. We have seen a variety of approaches
applied to the same dataset, and we have been able
to compare the performance of pure approaches to
hybrid approaches, and of supervised approaches
to unsupervised approaches. The results reported
here are also encouraging, though clearly there is
considerable room for improvement.
This task has established a high baseline for sys-
tems to beat. We can take heart from the fact that
the best performance is apparently obtained from a
combination of corpus-derived usage features and
dictionary-derived linguistic knowledge. Although
clever but simple approaches can do quite well on
such a task, it is encouraging to note that the best
results await those who employ the most robust
and the most informed treatments of NCs and their
paraphrases. Despite a good start, this is a chal-
lenge that remains resolutely open. We expect that
the dataset created for the task will be a valuable
resource for future research.
