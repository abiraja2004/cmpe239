Abstract 
Organizations that make use of large 
amounts of multimedia material 
(especially images and video) require 
easy access to such information. Recent 
developments in computer hardware and 
algorithm design have made possible 
content indexing of digital video 
information and efficient display of 3D 
data representations. This paper 
describes collaborative work between 
Boeing Applied Research & Technology 
(AR&T), Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU), and the Battelle Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratories 
(PNNL). to integrate media indexing 
with computer visualization to achieve 
effective content-based access to video 
information. Text metadata, representing 
video content, was extracted from the 
CMU Informedia system, processed by 
AR&T's text analysis software, and 
presented to users via PNNL's Starlight 
3D visualization system. This approach 
shows how to make multimedia 
information accessible to a text-based 
visualization system, facilitating aglobal 
view of large collections of such data. 
We evaluated our approach by making 
several experimental queries against a 
library of eight hours of video 
segmented into several hundred "video 
paragraphs." We conclude that search 
performance of Inforrnedia was 
enhanced in terms of ease of exploration 
by the integration with Starlight.

Introduction 
Boeing uses very large collections of data in 
the process of engineering and manufacturing 
commercial jet airplanes and in delivering 
complex military and space systems. The 
company also creates large amounts of 
information in the form of manuals and other 
documents obe delivered with these products. 
The need to control the cost of creating and 
accessing this information is motivation for 
new methods of indexing and searching 
computerized digital data. 
In 1996, the Natural Language Processing 
Group at Boeing AR&T began a collaboration 
with PNNL to jointly develop the Starlight 
information visualization system. AR&T 
developed the Text Processing Toolset (TPT) 
to perform indexing and querying operations in 
high-dimensional document spaces, and PNNL 
developed software for 3D graphics 
presentations. Although Starlight has a rich 
visual presentation, it processes only text and 
static imagery, and lacks any inherent 
capability for extracting content from 
multimedia data. Concurrently. as part of 
ongoing research into digital libraries, the 
AR&T Multimedia Group began support of the 
CMU Informedia project and obtained a 
demonstration system for searching indexed 
digital video information. At the heart of 
Informedia is a subsystem that creates text 
metadata that is descriptive of digital video 
content. This suggested awav to integrate the 
two systems. 
1 Informedia 
The Informedia Project has established a large 
on-line digital video library, incorporating 
video assets from WQED/Pittsburgh. The 
project is creating intelligent, automatic 
mechanisms for populating the library and 
allowing for its full-content and knowledge- 
based search and segment retrieval. Our 
approach applies several techniques for 
content-based searching and video-sequence 
retrieval. Content is conveyed in both the 
narrative (speech and language) and the image. 
Only by the collaborative interaction of image, 
speech, and natural-language understanding 
technology can we successfully populate, 
segment, index, and search diverse video 
collections with satisfactory recall and 
precision. 
The Informedia Project uses the Sphinx-II 
speech recognition system to transcribe 
narratives and dialogues automatically. The 
resulting transcript is then processed with 
methods of natural anguage understanding to
extract subjective descriptions and mark 
potential segment boundaries where significant 
semantic changes occur. Comparative 
difference measures are used in processing the 
video to mark potential segment boundaries. 
Images with small lfistogram disparity are 
considered to be relatively equivalent. By 
detecting significant changes in the weighted 
histogram of each successive frame, a 
sequence of images can be grouped into a 
segment. This simple and robust method for 
segmentation is fast and can detect 90% of the 
scene changes in video. 
Segment breaks produced by image processing 
are examined along with the boundaries 
identified by the natural language processing 
of the transcript, and an improved set of 
segment boundaries are heuristically derived to 
partition the video library into sets of 
segments, or "video paragraphs." 
Figure 1 illustrates the video searching 
facilities of Informedia, which include:

2 Starlight 
Starlight was originally developed as an 
interactive information visualization 
environment for the US Army Intelligence and 
Security Command (INSCOM). It is designed 
to integrate several types of data (unstructured 
and structured text documents, geographic 
information, and digital imagery') into a single 
analysis space for rapid comparison of content 
and interrelationships (see reference 5). In this 
section, we will concentrate on the Starlight 
text processing and indexing functions. 
A major problem with incorporating free-text 
documents into a visualization environment is
that each document must be coded so that it 
can be clustered with other documents. The 
Boeing TPT is a prototype software ngine that 
supports automatic oding and categorization 
of documents, concept-based querying, and 
visualization over large text document 
databases. The TPT combines techniques from 
statistics, linear algebra, and computational 
linguistics in order to take account of the total 
context in which words occur in a given 
document or qUery; it statistically compares a
document context with similar contexts from 
other documents in the database. Through this 
technique, document sets can be represented in 
a way that supports visualization and analysis 
by the presentation components of Starlight. 
The TPT performs two functions: First. it 
provides a powerful and flexible mechanism 
for concept-based searching over large text 
databases; second, it automatically assigns 
individual text units to coordinates in a user- 
configurable 3D semantic space. Both of these 
functions derive from the TPT core technique 
of representing large numbers of text units as 
points in a higher dimensional space and 
performing similarity calculations in this 
space. Conceptually, the flow of data through 
the TPT is diagrammed in Figure 2:

Prior to TPT indexing, a text collection must be 
preprocessed in three stages involving manual 
intervention: First, the text is divided into units 
with topical granularity that best correlates with 
the expected query patterns. The units can be 
titles, subject lines, abstracts, individual 
paragraphs or an entire document. It can also be 
a caption or a piece of transcribed text from a 
video. Next, the text is "tokenized" into 
individual words and phrases. Finally, a list of 
"'stopwords,'" or ignored terms, is chosen. These 
include determiners (e.g., a, the), conjunctions 
(e.g., and, or), and relatives (e.g., what, which), 
and certain domain-specific terms. 
After preprocessing, operation of the TPT 
indexing system is automatic (see Figure 2). The 
software builds a document/term matrix, 
performs everal transformation and dimension 
reduction calculations, and stores output 
matrices in an object-oriented database for use 
by the Starlight visualization component. 
Users of Starlight can visually explore the 
topical structure of a large text database by 
navigating through a 3D topic space where each 
item is represented as a point in a scatterplot. 
Items with close visual proximity have similar 
content. The TPT provides a selection of 
dimensions (with associated topic words), any 
three of which can potentially be selected for 
axes of the scatterplot. 
Figure 3 shows a Starlight visualization screen 
containing a 3D scatterplot of the 322-item 
video metadata extracted from InformecUa: each 
axis is labeled with the dominant topics 
measured by the TPT. At the right of Figure 3 is 
an example query with results.

Integration of the two systems required the 
insertion of two processing steps, each involving 
new software development. Figure 4 shows the 
flow of data in and between the two systems; 
new integration elements are shown as shaded 
boxes. The two key elements are: (1) Extract 
video paragraph text metadata from Informedia, 
and (2) Display selected video paragraphs.

Extraction of metadata is accomplished by a C 
program that reads ASCII text and control 
parameters from several flies in the Informedia 
system and writes a collection of items 
compatible with TPT processing. Each item 
represents one video paragraph and includes the 
following fields:

Display of video paragraphs occurs in the 
context of a web page containing a video viewer 
and the text transcript; Figure 5 shows an 
example. When the user selects a particular 
document within Starlight. a browser displays 
the HTML page. The browser was coded in Java 
and the MPEG viewer is a Microsoft 
ActiveMovie control. Each digital video file was

not partitioned into separate files; rather, 
paragraphs are viewed by playing from the 
specified "In" frame to the "Out" frame of the 
appropriate MPEG file. 
advantages. Neither system was designed for 
narrow, precise data querying, rather Starlight 
features all-inclusive views and Informedia 
facilitates iterative, progressive narrowing of 
focus. Motivation for integrating the systems 
was twofold: Give Starlight access to 
multimedia data, and investigate possible 
advantages of the global overview that Starlight 
can bring to the Informedia database. 
We collected the following list of video titles 
from diverse sources at Boeing: 
? PBS Feature: 21st Century Jet (Parts 1-6) 
? Boeing Education Network (BEN) Tutorial:

? Boeing Education Network (BEN) Lecture:

Altogether, this material comprises about eight 
hours of viewing. The digitized MPEG files 
occupy approximately 4.5GB of disk space and 
the metadata (transcripts, thumbnail mages, and 
cross-reference fil s) is about 25MB in size.

4 Exper imenta l  Results 
Although both Informedia and Starlight 
separately exhibit powerful capabilities for 
accessing large collections of data, it was 
interesting to speculate about synergistic 
The video data was indexed by Informedia, then 
we passed the resulting metadata to Starlight as 
described above. Starlight presents the entire 
collection of hundreds of video paragraphs as a 
scatterplot of points for viewing, which can be 
color-coded by video title. We immediately 
observed that items with like colors tended to 
cluster together, verifying that TPT processing 
was effective in bringing together topically 
related items. 
In an experiment to evaluate the further effects 
of integration, we posed several queries to both 
Informedia and Starlight, noted commonalties 
and differences in response, then used the global 
38 
view of Starlight o find other items with similar 
content and to discover additional search terms. 
After Starlight reported query "hits," we 
observed the region in 3D space encompassed 
by the video file containing the most hits. Using 
the cursor brush to see abstracts, we examined

The last three columns indicate a positive result 
by showing additional video paragraphs and 
search terms relating to the initial query. The 
additional items varied in degree of relevance, 
but the cost of the new information is low in that 
only a few seconds were required to examine 
each. This illustrates the capacity of the 
integrated approach as an interactive tool for 
ready access to video content. 
Conclusion 
This effort clearly succeeded in the goal of 
providing access to multimedia content for the 
Starlight system. We have also shown the

noted interesting terms. Because the axes were 
topically labeled, additional terms were also 
available from the axis in the vicinity of the 
cluster. Table 1 shows the results of this 
experiment.

The concept of bringing text metadata into 
Starlight is extensible to image, sound, 
animation, and other media, which suggests 
further experimentation with other forms of 
multimedia information and methods of 
generating metadata. 
Both Informedia indexing and Starlight 
processing require some manual intervention. In 
order for these approaches to be efficient and 
cost-effective, we must develop fully automatic 
methods for creating and processing text 
metadata for multimedia information. It may be 
possible to do this by compromising the quality 
of metadata (perhaps by using unedited speech 
recognition from Informedia); a future 
experiment would be to attempt this compromise 
and discover the effect on search performance.
