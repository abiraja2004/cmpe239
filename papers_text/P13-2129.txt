Abstract
Although diathesis alternations have been
used as features for manual verb clas-
sification, and there is recent work on
incorporating such features in computa-
tional models of human language acquisi-
tion, work on large scale verb classifica-
tion has yet to examine the potential for
using diathesis alternations as input fea-
tures to the clustering process. This pa-
per proposes a method for approximating
diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus
data and shows, using a state-of-the-art
verb clustering system, that features based
on alternation approximation outperform
those based on independent subcategoriza-
tion frames. Our alternation-based ap-
proach is particularly adept at leveraging
information from less frequent data.
1 Introduction
Diathesis alternations (DAs) are regular alterna-
tions of the syntactic expression of verbal argu-
ments, sometimes accompanied by a change in
meaning. For example, The man broke the win-
dow ? The window broke. The syntactic phe-
nomena are triggered by the underlying semantics
of the participating verbs. Levin (1993)?s seminal
book provides a manual inventory both of DAs and
verb classes where membership is determined ac-
cording to participation in these alternations. For
example, most of the COOK verbs (e.g. bake,
cook, fry . . . ) can all take various DAs, such as
the causative alternation, middle alternation and
instrument subject alternation.
In computational linguistics, work inspired by
Levin?s classification has exploited the link be-
tween syntax and semantics for producing clas-
sifications of verbs. Such classifications are use-
ful for a wide variety of purposes such as se-
mantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002),
predicting unseen syntax (Parisien and Steven-
son, 2010), argument zoning (Guo et al, 2011)
and metaphor identification (Shutova et al, 2010).
While Levin?s classification can be extended man-
ually (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), a large body of re-
search has developed methods for automatic verb
classification since such methods can be applied
easily to other domains and languages.
Existing work on automatic classification relies
largely on syntactic features such as subcatego-
rization frames (SCF)s (Schulte im Walde, 2006;
Sun and Korhonen, 2011; Vlachos et al, 2009;
Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002). There has also
been some success incorporating selectional pref-
erences (Sun and Korhonen, 2009).
Few have attempted to use, or approximate,
diathesis features directly for verb classification
although manual classifications have relied on
them heavily, and there has been related work on
identifying the DAs themselves automatically us-
ing SCF and semantic information (Resnik, 1993;
McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999;
McCarthy, 2000; Tsang and Stevenson, 2004).
Exceptions to this include Merlo and Stevenson
(2001), Joanis et al (2008) and Parisien and
Stevenson (2010, 2011). Merlo and Stevenson
(2001) used cues such as passive voice, animacy
and syntactic frames coupled with the overlap
of lexical fillers between the alternating slots to
predict a 3-way classification (unergative, unac-
cusative and object-drop). Joanis et al (2008)
used similar features to classify verbs on a much
larger scale. They classify up to 496 verbs us-
ing 11 different classifications each having be-
tween 2 and 14 classes. Parisien and Steven-
son (2010, 2011) used hierarchical Bayesian mod-
els on slot frequency data obtained from child-
directed speech parsed with a dependency parser
to model acquisition of SCF, alternations and ul-
timately verb classes which provided predictions
for unseen syntactic behaviour of class members.

Table 1: Example frames for verb spray
In this paper, like Sun and Korhonen (2009);
Joanis et al (2008) we seek to automatically clas-
sify verbs into a broad range of classes. Like Joa-
nis et al, we include evidence of DA, but we do
not manually select features attributed to specific
alternations but rather experiment with syntactic
evidence for alternation approximation. We use
the verb clustering system presented in Sun and
Korhonen (2009) because it achieves state-of-the-
art results on several datasets, including those of
Joanis et al, even without the additional boost in
performance from the selectional preference data.
We are interested in the improvement that can be
achieved to verb clustering using approximations
for DAs, rather than the DA per se. As such we
make the simple assumption that if a pair of SCFs
tends to occur with the same verbs, we have a po-
tential occurrence of DA. Although this approx-
imation can give rise to false positives (pairs of
frames that co-occur frequently but are not DA)
we are nevertheless interested in investigating its
potential usefulness for verb classification. One
attractive aspect of this method is that it does not
require a pre-defined list of possible alternations.
2 Diathesis Alternation Approximation
A DA can be approximated by a pair of SCFs.
We parameterize frames involving prepositional
phrases with the preposition. Example SCFs for
the verb ?spray? are shown in Table 1. The feature
value of a single frame feature is the frequency
of the SCF. Given two frames fv(i), fv(j) of a
verb v, they can be transformed into a feature pair
(fv(i), fv(j)) as an approximation to a DA. The
feature value of the DA feature (fv(i), fv(j)) is ap-
proximated by the joint probability of the pair of
frames p(fv(i), fv(j)|v), obtained by integrating
all the possible DAs. The key assumption is that
the joint probability of two SCFs has a strong cor-
relation with a DA on the grounds that the DA gives
rise to both SCFs in the pair. We use the DA feature
(fv(i), fv(j)) with its value p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) as a
new feature for verb clustering. As a comparison
point, we can ignore the DA and make a frame in-
dependence assumption. The joint probability is
decomposed as:
p(fv(i), fv(j)|v)? , p(fv(i)|v) ? p(fv(j)|v) (1)
We assume that SCFs are dependent as they are
generated by the underlying meaning components
(Levin and Hovav, 2006). The frame dependency
is represented by a simple graphical model in fig-
ure 1.
Figure 1: Graphical model for the joint probability of pairs of
frames. v represents a verb, a represents a DA and f repre-
sents a specific frame in total of M possible frames
In the data, the verb (v) and frames (f ) are ob-
served, and any underlying alternation (a) is hid-
den. The aim is to approximate but not to detect a
DA, so a is summed out:
p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) =
?
a
p(fv(i), fv(j)|a) ? p(a|v)
(2)
In order to evaluate this sum, we use a relaxation
1: the sum in equation 1 is replaced with the max-
imum (max). This is a reasonable relaxation, as a
pair of frames rarely participates in more than one
type of a DA.
p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) ? max(p(fv(i), fv(j)|a)?p(a|v))
(3)
The second relaxation further relaxes the first one
by replacing the max with the least upper bound
(sup): If fv(i) occurs a times, fv(j) occurs b times
and b < a, the number of times that a DA occurs
between fv(i) and fv(j) must be smaller or equal
to b.
p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) ? sup{p(fv(i), fv(j)|a)} ? sup{p(a|v)}
(4)
sup{p(fv(i), fv(j)|a)} = Z?1 ?min(fv(i), fv(j))
sup{p(a|v)} = 1
Z =
?

1A relaxation is used in mathematical optimization for re-
laxing the strict requirement, by either substituting it with an
easier requirement or dropping it completely.

NP+PPon NP+PPon - 40
NP+PPwith NP+PPwith - 30
PPwith PPwith - 0
PPon PPon - 30
Table 2: Example frame pair features for spray
So we end up with a simple form:
p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) ? Z?1 ?min(fv(i), fv(j)) (5)
The equation is intuitive: If fv(i) occurs 40 times
and fv(j) 30 times, the DA between fv(i) and
fv(j) ? 30 times. This upper bound value is used
as the feature value of the DA feature. The original
feature vector f of dimension M is transformed
into M2 dimensions feature vector f? . Table 2
shows the transformed feature space for spray.
The feature space matches our expectation well:
valid DAs have a value greater than 0 and invalid
DAs have a value of 0.
3 Experiments
We evaluated this model by performing verb clus-
tering experiments using three feature sets:
F1: SCF parameterized with preposition. Exam-
ples are shown in Table 1.
F2: The frame pair features built from F1 with
the frame independence assumption (equa-
tion 1). This feature is not a DA feature as
it ignores the inter-dependency of the frames.
F3: The frame pair features (DAs) built from
F1 with the frame dependency assumption
(equation 4). This is the DA feature which
considers the correlation of the two frames
which are generated from the alternation.
F3 implicitly includes F1, as a frame can pair
with itself. 2 In the example in Table 2, the frame
pair ?PP(on) PP(on)? will always have the same
value as the ?PP(on)? frame in F1.
We extracted the SCFs using the system of
Preiss et al (2007) which classifies each corpus
2We did this so that F3 included the SCF features as well
as the DA approximation features. It would be possible in
future work to exclude the pairs involving identical frames,
thereby relying solely on the DA approximations, and com-
pare performance with the results obtained here.
occurrence of a verb as a member of one of the 168
SCFs on the basis of grammatical relations iden-
tified by the RASP (Briscoe et al, 2006) parser.
We experimented with two datasets that have been
used in prior work on verb clustering: the test sets
7-11 (3-14 classes) in Joanis et al (2008), and the
17 classes set in Sun et al (2008).
We used the spectral clustering (SPEC) method
and settings as in Sun and Korhonen (2009) but
adopted the Bhattacharyya kernel (Jebara and
Kondor, 2003) to improve the computational effi-
ciency of the approach given the high dimension-
ality of the quadratic feature space.
wb(v, v?) =
D?
d=1
(vdv?d)1/2 (6)
The mean-filed bound of the Bhattacharyya kernel
is very similar to the KL divergence kernel (Jebara
et al, 2004) which is frequently used in verb clus-
tering experiments (Korhonen et al, 2003; Sun
and Korhonen, 2009).
To further reduce computational complexity, we
restricted our scope to the more frequent features.
In the experiment described in this section we used
the 50 most frequent features for the 3-6 way clas-
sifications (Joanis et al?s test set 7-9) and 100 fea-
tures for the 7-17 way classifications. In the next
section, we will demonstrate that F3 outperforms
F1 regardless of the feature number setting. The
features are normalized to sum 1.
The clustering results are evaluated using F-
Measure as in Sun and Korhonen (2009) which
provides the harmonic mean of precision (P ) and
recall (R)
P is calculated using modified purity ? a global
measure which evaluates the mean precision of
clusters. Each cluster (ki ? K) is associated
with the gold-standard class to which the major-
ity of its members belong. The number of verbs
in a cluster (ki) that take this class is denoted by
nprevalent(ki).
P =
?
ki?K:nprevalent(ki)>2
nprevalent(ki)
|verbs|
R is calculated using weighted class accuracy:
the proportion of members of the dominant cluster
DOM-CLUSTi within each of the gold-standard
classes ci ? C.

The results are shown in Table 3. The result of
F2 is lower than that of F3, and even lower than
that of F1 for 3-6 way classification. This indi-
cates that the frame independence assumption is
a poor assumption. F3 yields substantially better
result than F2 and F1. The result of F3 is 6.4%
higher than the result (F=63.28) reported in Sun
and Korhonen (2009) using the F1 feature.
This experiment shows, on two datasets, that DA
features are clearly more effective than the frame
features for verb clustering, even when relaxations
are used.
4 Analysis of Feature Frequency
A further experiment was carried out using F1 and
F3 on Joanis et al (2008)?s test sets 10 and 11.
The frequency ranked features were added to the
clustering one at a time, starting from the most
frequent one. The results are shown in figure 2.
F3 outperforms F1 clearly on all the feature num-
ber settings. After adding some highly frequent
frames (22 for test set 10 and 67 for test set 11),
the performance for F1 is not further improved.
The performance of F3, in contrast, is improved
for almost all (including the mid-range frequency)
frames, although to a lesser degree for low fre-
quency frames.

Parisien and Stevenson (2010) introduced a hier-
archical Bayesian model capable of learning verb
alternations and constructions from syntactic in-
put. The focus was on modelling and explaining
the child alternation acquisition rather than on au-
tomatic verb classification. Therefore, no quanti-
tative evaluation of the clustering is reported, and
the number of verbs under the novel verb gen-
eralization test is relatively small. Parisien and

tures clearly outperform frame features. The top figure is the
result on test set 10 (8 ways). The bottom figure is the result
on test set 11 (14 ways). The x axis is the number of features.
The y axis is the F-Measure result.
Stevenson (2011) extended this work by adding
semantic features.
Parisien and Stevenson?s (2010) model 2 has a
similar structure to the graphic model in figure 1.
A fundamental difference is that we explicitly use
a probability distribution over alternations (pair of
frames) to represent a verb, whereas they represent
a verb by a distribution over the observed frames
similar to Vlachos et al (2009) ?s approach. Also
the parameters in their model were inferred by
Gibbs sampling whereas we avoided this inference
step by using relaxation.
6 Conclusion and Future work
We have demonstrated the merits of using DAs for
verb clustering compared to the SCF data from
which they are derived on standard verb classi-
fication datasets and when integrated in a state-
of-the-art verb clustering system. We have also
demonstrated that the performance of frame fea-
tures is dominated by the high frequency frames.
In contrast, the DA features enable the mid-range
frequency frames to further improve the perfor-
mance.
739
In the future, we plan to evaluate the perfor-
mance of DA features in a larger scale experiment.
Due to the high dimensionality of the transformed
feature space (quadratic of the original feature
space), we will need to improve the computational
efficiency further, e.g. via use of an unsupervised
dimensionality reduction technique Zhao and Liu
(2007). Moreover, we plan to use Bayesian in-
ference as in Vlachos et al (2009); Parisien and
Stevenson (2010, 2011) to infer the actual param-
eter values and avoid the relaxation.
Finally, we plan to supplement the DA feature
with evidence from the slot fillers of the alternat-
ing slots, in the spirit of earlier work (McCarthy,
2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis et al,
2008). Unlike these previous works, we will use
selectional preferences to generalize the argument
heads but will do so using preferences from dis-
tributional data (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) rather
than WordNet, and use all argument head data in
all frames. We envisage using maximum average
distributional similarity of the argument heads in
any potentially alternating slots in a pair of co-
occurring frames as a feature, just as we currently
use the frequency of the less frequent co-occurring
frame.
