This paper i s  addressed to the view of  Schank and B i rn -  
baum (1981) that  syntax has no "pr iv i leged 'pos i t ion  in  pars -  
ing .  Ev ident ly  what i s  meant i s  (a)  that  syntact i c  pars ing  
has no logical or temporal priority over semantic processing, 
and (b) that  syntax has been as@igned attention far out of 
proportion to its interest or distinctiveness. (The latter is 
not asserted outright, but seems implicit in the overall tone 
of the discussion.) In the view of the authors (henceforth 
"SB'), syntactic considerations come into play in sentence 
u~derstandi~E only where it is needed to resolve indeterminac- 
ies. It is this view that I wish to subject to scrutiny. 
Part of the case for the position that syntacting pars- 
ing is not a prerequisite to semantic analysis lies ix~ the 
fact that there are sentences which can be understood without 
a~y invocation of syntactic considerations at all. Such a 
case is 
( 1 ) John ate lunch. 
since it is intrinsic to the concept of eating that it is an 
action carried out by animate beings; thus, since only J=o~_~ 
denotes such a being in (I), it denotes the actor, leaving 
lunch to be understood as denoting whatever was ingested. On 
the other hand, since animate beings are themselves i~gestib- 
le, one would presumably have to invoke at least low-level 
- 150  - 
syntact i c  cues to  cor rect ly  parse  
(2)  The oanmiba ls  a te  the  Rev. Dr. Abercrombie .  
It is possible, however, that SB would deny that syntax must 
be called even in this case since world knowledge might be 
capable of sorting out the roles. One might suppose that there 
is a script called ,~CANNI3AL which includes a soeDario in- 
volvi~E putting missionaries in pots of boiling water and 
then eating them; assumil~ that there is no other world know- 
ledge to suF~eet that missionaries typically return the favor, 
then (2) can be parsed asyntaotically as well. If this is so, 
however, then there is a problem with 
(3) The Rev. Dr. Abercombie ate the cannibals. 
No speaker of ED~lish would interpret (3) as synonymous with 
(2); thus, even if (2) is parsed asyntactically, (3) could 
not  be.  But g iven  that  the  amount of  p r io r  semant ic  in fo rmat -  
ion  ( i .e .  ind iv idua l  word meanings)  i s  exact ly  the  same in  
both  cases ,  how i s  a dec is ion  to  be made to  ca l l  the  syntax  
in  the  case  of  (3) but  not  in  the  case  of  (2)?  Comparable 
prob lems w i l l  f requent ly  a~ise  w i th  f igurat ive  language;  so,  
fo r  example,  
(4)  The ta i l  wagged the  dog. 
i s  a way of  say ing  that  some expected  re la t ionsh ip  was revers -  
ed;  and yet  ~ i s  a good case  of  an asy~etr io  p red icate ,  
requ i r ing  that  one o f  i t s  arguments  re fer  to  a body par t  o r  
extens ion  thereof  ( such  as  a f lag)  wh i le  the  o ther  denote  an 
an imate  be ing  of  some k ind .  In  a case l i ke  (4 ) ,  there  i s  no 
indeterminacy  on pure ly  semant ic  grounds as  to  which NP shou ld  
denote  which,  but  the  resu l t  that  would ensue from process ing  
(4)  in  para l le l  fash ion  to  
(5)  The dog wagged h is  ta i l .  
i s ,  in  e f fec t ,  over ru led  by the  syntax .  I t  i s ,  indeed,  on ly  
from th is  over ru l ing  that  one would know that  one was dea l ing  
- 151  - 
with  f igurat ive  language.  Assuming that  (4) i s  parsed s rsntac -  
t ioa l l7  but not  (5) ,  we are then fo rced  onto the fo l low ing  
dilemma: syntax i s  ca l led  only where i t  i s  needed to over ru le  
the consequences of  an asTntact i c  pa~se; but the cond i t ions  
under wh?ch such a ca l l  need be made themselves  depend on sTn- 
taottc~ in fo rmat ion  ( in  th i s  case word order  cues) ,  s ince  the 
word - leve l  semantic  in fo rmat ion  (a l l  e l se  that  i s  ava i lab le )  
cannot distinguish (4) from (5). 
What SB have done here::  i s  to  confuse redundancy and 
super f lu i ty .  Cases l i ke  (1) and (5) show that  syntax i s  some- 
t imes redundant ;  but  s ince  word - leve l  semsnt i~  does not  p ro -  
v ide  a way of  d is t J~ l&~Lsh i~ when i t  must be ca l led  and when 
it need not  be, syntax  must be ca l led  ind isor imJ~te l~.  We 
might ca l l  th i s  the " fa i l - sa fe"  concept ion  o f  the in teract ion  
of  syntax  and semant ics .  
Nonethe less ,  SB might we l l  answer, there  i s  ev idence 
that  human language users  ac tua l ly  do parse asyntaot i ca l l y .  
They c i te  the fac t  that  someone w i th  imper fec t  knowledge of  a 
fo re ign  language may nonethe less  be ab le  to  read wr i t ten  ma- 
te r ia l s  in  the language,  us ing  noth i~ but word meaning and 
wor ld knowledge as a gu ide .  But wh i le  there  i s  no doubt that  
human be ings  are  capable  o f  doing th i s ,  i t  does not  fo l low 
that  th i s  i s  what they would do i f  they were not  fo rced  to? To 
say that  one o f ten  doesn ' t  need a cer ta in  k ind o f  knowledge to 
CaZT7 OUt a g iven  task  does not  imply that  one ignores  i t  t f  
one has i t .  
I would l i ke  f ina l l7  to  ca l l  a t tent ion  to  a problem that  
i s  not  addressed a t  a l l  by SB, but which i s  a t  the very center  
o f  concern in  the des ign  o f  adequate natura l  language under -  
standing systems? As SB present it, the problem of language 
understanding comes down to that of ascertalnlng the meanings 
of 11~u/stio expressions and then interrelatlng them in appro- 
priate w~.Ts. No mention is made, however, of the problem of 
knowlng what the expressions are to begin with. How does one 
- 152  - 
know, for example, that Kreen aDDle is an expression denoting 
the object of perception in (6a) but not in (6b)? 
(6) a. John saw the ~reen apple. 
b. John saw the green apple tree. 
Examples of this kind can be multiplied in many dlrections. 
Pot example, in 
(7) a. I watched John and Mary run to the police station. 
b. I watched John and Mary ran to the police station. 
John and Mar~ is an expression denoting the performers of the 
act of running in (7a), but not in (To), The kinds of examples 
discussed by 3B involve few multi-word constituents, and those 
that do arise seem to be of a kind that can be handled by rath- 
er local recognition meohanis~s; but cases like (7) show the 
need in  some cases  to take g loba l  syntact i c  context  in to  
account as we l l .  The problems that  a r i se  in  th i s  regard  are 
not  t r i v ia l ,  and as long as they ex is t ,  syntax w i l l  remain 
"Pr iv i leged"  a t  leas t  in  the sense that  i t  w i l l  make a major  
c la im on the a t tent ion  of  some invest igators  and thus cont i -  
nue tO have a life of its own.
