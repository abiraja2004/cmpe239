COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS 
OF VERBAL BEHAVIOUR 
The paper attempts to contribute to the development of the math- 
ematical models of verbal behaviour by demonstrating the use of multi- 
dimensional individual scaling methods for differential representation 
of verbal perceptual structures. 
The method is illustrated with data on computational nalysis of 
perception of letters of Russian alphabet. 
The main concern of computational linguistics (at least, of its theo- 
retically oriented branch) has been the automatic analysis or generation 
of written texts. " Computational linguistic analysis " has thus become 
a tool for the validation of linguistic methods and theories. 
Another branch of computational linguistics - a more empirical 
and more practically-oriented one - has been largely restricted to data 
processing and information - retrieval problems. 
It is safe to say that the full extent of the potential influence of the 
computational pproach upon the study of language functioning, that 
is of speech perception and verbal behaviour has not been generally 
recognized. Unlike psychologists, linguists have been rather slow to 
adopt computers for the development and evaluation of mathematical 
models of verbal behaviour. The present paper attempts to contribute 
to the development of such models by demonstrating the use of some 
computational approaches for differential representation of verbal 
perceptual structures. 
Speech perception may in a broad sense be defined as that part of 
the communication process taking place within the receiver. We should 
try to reach a more detailed view of the speech perception mechanism, 
that is to suggest some "white box" instead of the "black box" 
The common methodological premise for a model which accounts 
for various aspects of the speech perception problem is a representation 
of any speech unit (a sound, a syllable, a word etc.) as a point in a mul- 
tidimensional perceptual space with the perceived ifference between 
172 R. M. FRUMKINA-  P. F. ANDRUKOVlCH-  A. YU. TEREKHINA 
such stimuli represented by the distance between the stimulus points. 
To develop a model for this psychological space we have: 1) to 
determine the dimensionality of the space; 2) to describe the position 
of the speech stimuli in question along the dimensions obtained; 3) 
to determine the position of the Ss perceiving the given set of speech 
stimuli with respect to these dimensions; 4) to suggest some linguistic 
and/or psychological interpretation of the discriminative dimensions 
and of groupings (if any) of individuals having different " viewpoints" 
about stimulus interrelations. 
From the manner fia which Ss make perceptual similarity judgements 
about verbal stimuli t is possible to infer the dimensions of the given 
set of stimuli which account for the responses obtained. 
Methods of multidimensional scaling provide us with highly sophis- 
ticated tools for making this inference. The problem of multidimen- 
sional scaling broadly stated is to find n points whose interpoint distances 
match in some sense the experimental similarities of n objects (instead 
of similarities the experimental measurements may be dissimilarities, 
confusion probabilities or other measures). Hence, we view muhidi' 
mensional scaling as a problem of statistical fitting - the similarities 
are given, and we wish to find the point configuration whose distances 
fit them best. 
The well-known method of principal components can be used to 
fred out the most discriminative r sponse dimensions (W. S. TORG~R- 
SON, 1952). Given data which represent onmetric information concern- 
ing perceived similarity of stimuli, this method aims at constructing 
a configuration of those stimuli in a best-fitting Euclidean subspace. 
The dimensions obtained are oriented along the latent vectors corre- 
sponding to the most valued latent roots of similarity matrix. Method 
of principal components gives a linear orthogonal projection in a best 
fitting subspace. 
There exists, however, another class of methods which provide for 
the mapping of raw data by some kind of non-linear transformation. 
For the analysis of perceptual structures in verbal behaviour the pres- 
ent authors have used a modification of the "individual multidimen- 
sional scaling" methods uggested by B. BLOXOM (1968), C. Hoa_~N 
(1969) and J. D. CAaROL and J. j. CrlANG (1970). This approach to the 
analysis of experimental data permits us to describe the individual dif- 
ferences between Ss in stimuli perception. In our previous research we 
have applied some methods of multidimensional scaling for studying 
the subjective probability estimates of Russian words. In the present 
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF VERBAL BEHAVIOUR 173 
paper for purposes of illustration we perform an analysis of similarity 
judgements among block letters of the Russian alphabet according to 
the above mentioned model. 
Measures of perceived similarity among stimuli may be obtained 
by several experimental procedures. Tiffs study uses the data of the 
experiment, in which the stimuli - 32 block letters of Russian alphabet - 
were presented pair-wise (E. N. GrR~ANOV, P. F. ANDRUKOV'tCH, A. 
P. VASlrEWCH, 1972; the same procedure was used by T. K/2NNAVAS, 
1966). Ss have been asked to judge each pair of letters as "alike " or 
"not alike ". Each comparison was made by at least 50 Ss, the "point 
of view" of each S being represented by similarity matrix with 0 for 
"al ike" and 1 for "not alike" as entries.

After these data had been processed by the method of principal 
components we have obtained the plotting of stimuli on the planes 
corresponding to various pairs of latent vectors. We have excluded 
from further analysis the first latent vector because it has more or less 
constant elements and may be regarded as allowing for the mean value 
of distance between all the elements of pairs (J. C. GowrR, 1966). 
The projection of letters obtained is presented in Fig. 1 and 2.

An analysis of these configurations resulted in discovering the three 
main factors underlying the perceptual behaviour of the Ss: 
COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF VERBAL BEHAVIOUR 175 
\["' 32 P.ussi~n b2ock letter.~ '" .'\] 
/ 3d factor ~ / 2dfactor ~ 
, , (,P,,,,B),,, (0, C) (llI H) , ,, (M,X) \] 
A more detailed analysis can be made from the data based upon 
the projections on successive coordinate axes allowing for progressively 
less important differences among letters. 
Now we turn to individual scaling method which, as we have 
stated earlier, permits us to uncover the individual perceptual structures. 
According to this approach individuals are assumed ifferentially to 
weight he several dimensions of the "common psychological space" 
Let us take an assumption about the existence of a " true" point 
configuration i  k-dimensional Euclidean space, where a set of k di- 
mensions or "factors" are common to all individuals, but the weights 
they assign to these factors are different. Then, for any individual the 
" weighted" Euclidean distance if given by 
/? 
i = l=1 
where xil, x jz-  values of the j-th and i-th stimulus on the l-th dimen- 
sion, Whl - the weight which represents he salience of the l-th dimen- 
sion for the h-th individual. If for a given S the l-th dimension have 
no importance at all, w~ will be equal to zero. 
Let us denote by Dh the similarity matrix for h-th individual. Now 
our goal will be to find out such point configuration and such set of 
weights to minimize some functionf (Dh, dh) used as a criterion of good- 
ness of fit. One of the present authors has suggested the following 
criterion: 
Sh Di s ' 
' (D,,-d,;) ~ ? D,;, for d,, < D,;. 
This criterion applied, the distortion of the small distances makes 
them smaller, and the distortion of the greater ones makes them great- 
er, thus permitting better discrimination between groups of objects.

To evaluate the amount of discrepancies for all the judges, we can 
take the average of Sh thus defining the following divergency criterion: 
m 
S---- --1~S h 
m h=l  
The gradient method has been used for obtaining the numerical val- 
ues of x~ and wh~ which minimize the value of S. Limiting ourselves 
to the two-dimensional representation of the Ss' perceptual spaces 
we may plot our data on the plane, taking values of xi~ as coordinates 
of the stimuli and wja as those of the Ss. Fig. 3 and 4 represent two 
interrelated point configurations.

It is evideDt, from Fig. 3, that there are groupings of letters accord- 
ing to their subjective intersimilarity, thus providing us with two 
psycholinguistically interpretable dimensions. The analysis reveals that 
dimension 1 corresponds to the opposition "letters with straight ele- 
ments - letters without straight elements ". The dimension 2corresponds 
to the opposition "letters with acute-angular elements - letters without 
acute-angular elements" 
Method of individual scaling also provides us with a mapping of 
Ss into two-dimensional subject space. Coordinates of the point for 
a given S in this space correspond to the weights of the various dimen- 
sions in the stimulus pace. Fig. 4 gives a visual impression of the one-- 
two plane of the subjects pace. We see that the Ss can be first of all 
contrasted with respect o magnitude of the weights assigned by them 
to the 1-st and 2-nd dimensions. The analysis of individual similarity 
matrixes revealed that the Ss who tended to choose answers " alike ", 
weighted equally low both the 1-st and the 2-nd dimensions, while 
the Ss with tendency to choose answers "not  alike" weighted heavily 
both dimensions. For instance, subject N. 5, who attached very low 
weight to both dimensions, gave 117 answers "al ike" and 36 answers 
" not alike ". A good contrast o the subject N. 5 is provided by the 
subjects N. 10 and N. 15, who answered "alike " only 3 times from 
153 comparison judgements. 
However, the most important outcome of our analysis is the fact 
that the same dimensions being present they have different relative 
importance for different Ss. One group of Ss attaches maximal weights 
to the 1-st dimension (in Fig. 4 the corresponding points are under 
the diagonal), while another group attaches maximal weights to the 
2-nd dimension. S N. 47 and S N. 41 provide a good contrast in this 
respect. S N. 47 weights dimension I considerably more than dimen- 
sion II while S N. 41 shows the opposite tendency. Fig. 5 and 6 contrast 
the " perceptual spaces " for these two subjects (coordinate axes are 
transformed by multiplication to the corresponding weights). 
Still, for the greater part of the Ss there seems to be almost no dif- 
ference in the weights for the dimensions (the corresponding points 
are plotted in Fig. 4 along the diagonal). The place of the study of in- 
dividual perceptual structures underlying similarity judgements of 
I~ussian letters is, of course, restricted to the value of iUustrative xam- 
ple. However, trivial could seem the resulting letter classification, even 
in this very simple case the method of individual scaling has allowed

us to obtain highly non-trivial results concerning the communality 
and differences of Ss' perceptual subspaces. 
We would like to stress that in the overall context of verbal behav- 
iour research the possibilities given to a linguist by the model described 
could not be overestimated. Perhaps, one of the strongest points of 
this method being applied to the analysis of verbal behaviour phenom- 
ena is its potential generalization to discovering socially determined 
cognitive superstructures underlying the individual behaviour. 
To give no more than one example the individual scaling method 
makes it possible to analyze confusions data for children at different 
stages of native language acquisition, thus providing some experimental 
data which, we hope, could throw some light on the problem of the 
internalized and unconscious peaker-heater's knowledge of his lan- 
guage (N. CHOMS~rY, 1965), which serves as a base for distinction be- 
tween "competence" and "performance"
