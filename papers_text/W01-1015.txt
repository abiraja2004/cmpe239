This paper presents the adaptation and
customization of two lexical resources:
Brill tagger, Brill (1992), and
EuroWordNet, Vossen et al (1998), to
be used in the ADVICE project
devoted to build an intelligent virtual
reality sales and service system that
uses human language technology.
 
The work described in this paper is
comprised in the ADVICE1 project, which
consists of the development of a new interface
for a craftsmanship tools e-commerce system.
With the aim of providing full support to
customers of online shops and to the users of
electronic services on the Internet during the
complete customer service lifecycle; the
ADVICE system will provide:
An advanced multimedia user interface
supporting natural language text input and
output, as well as an animated assistant, that
ensures a high level of user-system interaction.
A software environment for building intelligent
sales assistants for two types of selling and
marketing services: sales-service and after sales
service.
The virtual assistant supported by this
application will be capable of interacting with
the user in natural language, adapt its
recommendations to the requirements and

characteristics of the customers and provide
explanations of the advised products as well as
of the different interesting alternatives.
The dialogue is focussed on accomplishing
a specific task, ordering products in an e-
commerce system as well as getting advice
about those products. The complexity of this
domain lies in the broad product range with
specialization of the crafts for particular tasks
and applications.
One of the main aspects of the buying-
selling interaction in the web is the capability of
the web site of generating some kind of trust
feeling in the buyer, just like a human shop
assistant would do in a person-to-person
interaction. Things like understanding the buyer
needs, being able to give him technical advice,
assisting him in the final decision are not easy
things to achieve in a web selling site. Natural
language (NL) techniques can play a crucial role
in providing this kind of enhancements.
Another good motivation to integrate
natural language technology in this kind of sites
is to make the interaction easy to those people
less confident with the Internet or even
computer technologies. Inexperienced users feel
much more comfortable expressing themselves
and receiving information in natural language
rather than through the human standard ways.
An ADVICE project objective is to build a
generic language processing component
following a language engineering approach, that
is, to achieve maintainability, time optimization,
robustness, flexibility, domain adaptability and
generality. These features require profiting from
the existing resources taking into account that
the goal is to achieve systems that work in real
domains. Therefore, resources adaptation is a
crucial step when developing this kind of
systems, because these resources are not usually
compatible with domain requirements.
At current state two linguistic resources
have been analyzed and adapted in order to be
incorporated into the ADVICE project: Brill
tagger, Brill (1992), and EuroWordNet, Vossen
et al (1998).
The paper is structured as follows: next
section focuses on a brief description of the NL
module of ADVICE project; section 3 is devoted
to explain how the corpus study has influenced
the customization of the lexical resources;
sections 4 and 5 outline the Brill tagger and
EuroWordnet extension to cover specific
domain peculiarities and, finally, in section 6
some conclusions and future work are presented.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the
ADVICE system. The Interface Agent includes
the  	 
 
 component
that is in charge of analyzing the user utterances
as well as of generating the appropriate answers
according to the dialogue.
The input sentence is interpreted in order to
obtain a semantic representation. At this
moment, two interpretation strategies are
defined. Firstly, message extraction techniques
useful in specific domains are used in ADVICE,
implemented by means of semantic grammars
reflecting e-commerce generic sentences and
idioms, sublanguage specific patterns and
keywords. Secondly, if the pattern matching
analysis does not work successfully, a robust
processor that makes use of several linguistic
resources (Brill tagger, EuroWordNet and a
Phrase Segmenter) integrates syntactic and
semantic analysis in different ways. The aim is
to attach the identified (syntactic or semantic)
segments of the sentence in a partial structure to
go on with the dialogue.
Concerning the generation of answers, a
domain-specific template-based approach is
proposed. The templates used to generate natural
language answers can be propositional (if they
require arguments to fill the slots in) or not
propositional (for instance, agreements,
rejections and topic movements).
The information gathering for the 

sources: dialogues collected from users, the

When dealing with such a restricted
domain, a great amount of the possibilities of
success relies on the domain adaptation
capability that the system proves. As long as an
intelligent, open domain and human-computer
dialogue is far from being realistic, the designers
usually focus on the customization of the
available resources so that they are as
trustworthy as possible when applied to selected
input, even though this implies a loss of
accuracy when it has to do with out-of-the-
domain texts.
The decision of directly adapting existing
resources comes from the fact that the initial

amount of data available was almost non-
existent. In other situation we could have
considered the possibility of developing the
resources from scratch or, at least, training them
(specially the tagger) so that its knowledge was
completely acquired for this application, but that
was too time consuming.
A Wizard of Oz experiment was conducted
to gain some domain specific data to work with.
A corpus of 527 sentences resulted from this
experiment, which were lexically and
syntactically annotated. As a side effect of this
experiment, the members of the development
team considerably increased their knowledge
and familiarity with the domain characteristics.
The corpus analysis has been performed
keeping in mind the need to separate domain-
independent aspects of the system from the
domain-specific components that serve to define
specific application domains.
Regarding the adaptation of the resources,
both of them (Brill tagger and EuroWordnet)
were affected by the results of the above-
mentioned process. As long as more and more
terminology was studied, it became evident the
highly structured way in which it could be
organized.
Although both lexical resources are
explained in detail in sections 4 and 5, some
special issues relating to domain-based
customization are outlined below.
After a careful study, the ontology
shown in figure 2 was developed, having each of
the boxes a complete set of specific terminology
(see figure 3).
At this stage EuroWordnet had been
understood to bring robustness to the NL
analysis contributing with its huge amount of
words in the form of a semantic network, but the
similarity of the proposed ontology with
EuroWordnet built-in structure lead us to a
proposal of extending the EuroWordnet
semantic network with the specific vocabulary
regarding our context and, even more important,
the relationships among them. To carry out this
proposal, it was firstly considered the option of
making use of the existing relations of
EuroWordnet and its domain labels. We will add
the terminology and definitions that were not
previously integrated, and tag all the specific
terminology with a domain label, so that it could
be directly identified as a word of special
interest for our needs and related to other words
in the domain. Unfortunately the first study of
this possibility revealed that it turned to be a
process much less intuitive than it appears at
first sight, and a deeper study about how this
process could be implemented is being carried
out at the moment of writing this paper.
Concerning Brill tagger, its revision was
also affected by the aforementioned corpus
analysis. First, the sentences extracted from the
corpus were analyzed in order to obtain a set of
generic patterns (about 90 patterns). This had
direct repercussions in the set of contextual rules
(the rules that the tagger uses to select the
correct tag for a word considering the context in
which it appears) which were adapted to fit the
domain peculiarities detected in the patterns, as
shown in figure 4. Some new rules were
developed and some of the existent were
modified.
The set of tags was also changed to help in
the domain customization process. A new tag
?XX? was defined to tag the words not present in
the lexicon. The words tagged with this tag are
good candidates to be domain terminology and
are stored in a special file to be analyzed. As a
result of this process, after the tagging of a
sufficient amount of text, we have a collection
of words that are good candidates to build up a
specialized lexicon. This lexicon can be used as
a support for the original one, filling the gaps

The Brill tagger, Brill (1992), is a rule-based
part of speech tagger programmed in Perl for
English language. A morphological analysis of a
word form produces a set of possible base forms
with associated inflectional information. For
each occurrence of a word form in context, a
POS (Part-of-Speech) tagger discriminates
which of these base forms is more likely in the
context. Our objective with this tagger was
twofold. Firstly, the tagger was translated (and
softly modified) into Prolog, and then, an
exhaustive study was carried out in order to
adapt it to ADVICE domain.
The development environment used in
ADVICE project, Ciao Prolog, Bueno et al
(1999), motivates the translation of resources
into Prolog. Furthermore, Prolog allows rapid
development and facilitates efficient and real-
time processing.
The tagger has three kinds of knowledge: a
base lexicon, contextual rules and lexical rules.
The  is a long list of words with one or
more possible tags associated. It is used to the
first assignment of tags to the input text. The
original knowledge is stored in a text file where
each line contains the word and the possible tags
that can be associated to the word. There are
93696 different entries. This lexicon was
directly translated into Prolog facts, having the
following structure: ps(Word,
ListOfTags). The words are stored as Prolog
terms and have been alphabetically sorted to
take advantage of the indexing capabilities of
Prolog. Here is a glance at the file contents:
ps(?charts?,[?NNS?,?VBZ?]).
ps(?chary?,[?JJ?]).
ps(?chase?,[?NN?,?JJ?,?VB?,?VBP?).
ps(?chased?,[?VBN?,?VBD?]).
ps(?chasers?,[?NNS?]).
ps(?chasing?,[?VBG?,?NN?]).
The 
  manage the knowledge
relative to the suitable tags for a word regarding
the context in which it appears. It considers both
the words and the tags that surround the word
under consideration and decides about the
correctness of the preassigned tag. The original
file contains 284 rules, stored in a text file in the
following format: NN VB PREVTAG TO,
which means ?change a NN (noun, singular or
mass) tag to VB (verb, base form) if the
previous tag is TO?. These contextual rules have
been translated into a set of Prolog rules plus a
predicate that goes through the input and applies
the appropriate rule if necessary until it reaches
the end of the text to tag. Every time it changes
a tag, it checks that the new tag is contained in
the set of allowed tags for that word. In other
case, the rule is not applied. Below, the main
predicate and an example rule are shown:
apply_cr([],[]).
apply_cr(List1,List2):-
contextual_rule(List1,List2).
contextual_rule(
[Word1/?TO?,Word2/?NN?|InputRest],
[Word1/?TO?,Word2/?VB?|OutpRest]):-
ps(Word2,TagList),
belongs(?VB?,TagList),
!,
apply_cr(InputRest,OutpRest).
As in the case of the original Brill, the order
of the rules is relevant to the final result, as one
of the early rules may affect the context of a
word so that a later rule may (or may not) be
applicable.
The 
  are used to infer the most
possible tag for a word considering its lexical
shape, specially its prefixes and suffixes. From
the 148 original rules, only the 63 regarding to
suffixes have been translated at this moment.
The structure of the original rules is: ly
hassuf 2 RB representing ?if the word has
the suffix, of length 2, "-ly", assign the tag RB
(adverb)?. The structure of the Prolog predicates
containing these lexical rules is equal to the one
from the contextual rules; we have an "apply_lr"
predicate and several "lexical_rule", combined
in the same way.
Finally, once all the resources have been
translated, the last part was the simulation of the
tagging process. This has been carried out
considering the information in Brill (1992), Brill
(1994) and Brill (1995), taken as a reference
starting point. The designed process works as
follows: first of all, the input is pre-processed to
decompose the possible contractions. Next, each
word in the input is attached its most probable
tag, taking as the most probable the first one in
the list of the lexicon. If a word is not present in
the lexicon, it is assigned a special tag XX
representing  instead of the noun
tag that it was assigned in the original tagger.
Then, lexical rules are applied (if possible)
trying to disambiguate the words that were not
found in the lexicon. Once every word has a tag,
we apply the contextual rules, resulting in the
definitive tagged text.
Apart from the already mentioned
modification of the general process of tagging,
some modifications in the knowledge bases have
been made, basically in order to adapt the
resource to our domain (craft tools). Regarding
the , we have adapted the punctuation
mark?s tags to our needs, changing the tags that
the original Brill tagger used. The objective was
to assign a different tag to every punctuation
mark, giving them a treatment equal to the
words. These symbols are relevant when we are
looking for a sentence syntax analysis or a
sentence pattern. Another change to the lexicon
is related with the order of the tags in certain
words, and is further explained in the next
paragraph.
The original set of contextual rules was
firstly translated as is. With this set of rules, a
corpus of 20 dialogues restricted to the domain
language obtained by the wizard-of-Oz
experiments was tagged. We compared the
results to the manually tagged text and we
extracted some common mistakes that the tagger
was making (Table 1). These mistakes could
lead us in two directions. If it was a mistagging
of a particular word frequently repeated, the best
way to fix it was to change the order of the tags
associated to that word in the lexicon.

For example, in our domain the word "saw"
appears most of the times as a noun while the
preferred tag in the lexicon for that word was
verb. In this case, placing the noun tag before
the verb one in the tag list turns to be a good and
simple solution. If the problem we were facing
was not related to particular words, but to word
categories, the way to fix it was through the
adding/deleting/modification of the contextual
rules. After the study of the errors, we
developed several new rules. For instance, a rule
for ?changing a tag 'IN' (meaning preposition or
subordinating conjunction) to RB (adverb) in the
collocation As ... as?.
Finally, concerning the lexical rules, the
main change comes from the fact that the words
that were not in the lexicon, in the original Brill
tagger were annotated as 'NN', while now they
have an special tag 'XX'. As these lexical rules
try to disambiguate these kind of words,
whenever an original rule was applied to a word
tagged as 'NN', it has been adapted to act on the
words tagged as 'XX'. Finally, only if none of
the rules has been able to disambiguate it, it is
automatically changed to 'NN'.

The first step in adapting EuroWordNet
database was to translate it into Prolog.
EuroWordNet stores its knowledge in file texts
that are organized in a very structured way. As a
first approach, the information extracted from
the databases has been the synonymy,
hyponymy and hyperonymy basic relations. This
is the minimum information needed to preserve
the semantic structure that lies beyond
EuroWordNet. The resulting lexical database
stores the information in the predicate ewn/5 as
Prolog facts. The first field references the word
of interest, the second stores the grammatical
category of the word, and the following, the
synonyms, hyperonyms and hyponyms,
respectively, as is shown below:
ewn(?phonograph?, n,
 sin([?record player?]),
 hyper([?machine?]),
 hypo([?acoustic gramophone?,
 ?jukebox?])).
From the analysis of domain application, an
ontology of concepts incorporating the
terminology has been obtained (a partial view
was shown in Figure 2). Intensive work is being
made in order to merge EuroWordNet and
domain ontology structures, resulting in an
enlarged resource fully adapted to our needs and
useful both as a lexicon and as a semantic
network.
Figure 4 shows an EuroWordNet partial
structure from Vossen et al (1998) on which the
vocabulary corresponding to two kinds of
concepts from the domain ontology (OBJECT
and ACTION) have been integrated (colored
rounded boxes with a dotted line). Moreover, a
new semantic relation named   is also
shown to represent the association between
OBJECT and ACTION. However, some of the
relationship provided by EuroWordNet (apart
from synonymy, hiponymy, and meronymy)
could probably cover some of the relations
present in the domain ontology.
In the same way, TOOL terminology is
inserted as 

The most important aspects of Brill tagger
and EuroWordNet adaptation to a specific
application domain and a development platform
have been explained. These resources are going
to be used in a dialogue system in order to give
robustness to the NL interpretation process.
We are currently involved in the process of
implementation of the enhancements proposed
in the paper. Concerning Brill tagger, only
preliminary tests have been carried out. The first
translation of the tagger was used to tag the
available corpus, showing an accuracy of
0.9163. Although this result is far from the state
of the art taggers, it is hopeful result, as the
improvements concerning the full terminology
and complete set of contextual rules had still
been incorporated. Results up to state of the art
levels are expected as the enhancements are
implemented.
Related EuroWordNet, we are studying if the
semantic relations (apart from synonymy,
hiponymy, meronymy) supported by
EuroWordNet are enough to cover the
relationships shown in the domain ontology of
Figure 2. For instance, there are semantic
relationships such as ! ", #
