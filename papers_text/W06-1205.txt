Abstract 
Complex Predicates or CPs are multi-
word complexes functioning as single 
verbal units. CPs are particularly 
pervasive in Hindi and other Indo-
Aryan languages, but an usage account 
driven by corpus-based identification 
of these constructs has not been 
possible since single-language systems 
based on rules and statistical 
approaches require reliable tools (POS 
taggers, parsers, etc.) that are 
unavailable for Hindi. This paper 
highlights the development of first 
such database based on the simple idea 
of projecting POS tags across an 
English-Hindi parallel corpus. The CP 
types considered include adjective-verb 
(AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb 
(Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV) 
composites. CPs are hypothesized 
where a verb in English is projected 
onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi. 
While this process misses some CPs, 
those that are detected appear to be 
more reliable (83% precision, 46% 
recall). The resulting database lists 
usage instances of 1439 CPs in 4400 
sentences. 
1 Introduction 
A "pain in the neck" (Sag et al, 2002) for 
NLP in languages of the Indo-Aryan family 
(e.g. Hindi-Urdu, Bangla and Kashmiri) is the 
fact that most verbs (nearly half of all 
instances in Hindi) occur as complex  
 
predicates - multi-word complexes which 
function as a single verbal unit in terms of 
argument and event structure (Hook, 1993; 
Butt and Geuder, 2003; Raina and Mukerjee, 
2005).  Moreover, most of these languages 
being resource-poor, even a proper corpus-
based characterization of such CPs has 
remained an elusive goal. 
In this paper we construct the first corpus-
based lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on 
projecting POS tags across parallel English-
Hindi corpora. While such approaches 
sometimes leave out some CPs, the ones that 
are identified are seen to be quite robust. As a 
result, this appears to be a good first approach 
for identifying the majority of CPs along with 
usage data. Moreover, since the language 
specific input in the procedure is minimal, it 
can be easily extended to other languages with 
similar multi word expressions. 
2 Complex Predicates 
CPs are characterized by a predicate or host - 
typically a noun (N), adjective (A), verb (V), 
or adverb (Adv) - followed by a light verb  
(LV),  a grammaticalized version of a main 
verb, which contributes little telic significance 
to the composite predicate. As an example, the 
English verb "describe" may be rendered in 
Hindi as the Noun-Verb complex ?????? + 
???, varNan kar, "description + do". Analysis 
based on a non-CP lexicon might assign the 
verbal head as kar (do), whereas functional 
aspects such as the argument structure are 
determined by the noun host varNan 
"description". An example of a V-V CP may 
28
be ??? + ???, kar de "do+give", where the light 
verb de ?give? imposes a completive aspect on 
the action kar ?do?.  
Identifying such constructs is a significant 
hurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasal 
parsing (Ray et al, 2003, Shrivastava et al, 
2005), translation (where each complex may 
be treated as a lexical unit in the target 
language), predicate-argument analysis, to 
semantic delineation. In addition to the 
computational aspects, a mere listing of all 
CPs occurring in the corpus would provide an 
important resource for tasks such as 
constructing WordNets (Narayan et al,2002) 
and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt and 
Geuder, 2003). 
Rule-based approaches to identifying CPs 
are not very effective since there do not seem 
to be any clear set of rules that can be used to 
distinguish CPs from non-CP constructs 
(contrast, for example, the composite CP 
??????? ??? anumati de "permission+give" with 
the non-composite N-V structure ?????? ??? 
kitaab de "give the book"). Even where such 
rules do exist, they depend on semantic 
properties such as the fact that book is a 
physical object which can be given in the 
physical sense (Raina and Mukerjee, 2005). 
However, in the translated form, the former 
may show up as a verb, whereas the latter 
invariably will be a N+V, so the tag projection 
would rule out the latter as a CP.  
Here we adopt a parallel corpus-based 
approach to creating a database of complex 
predicates in Hindi. The procedure can 
potentially be duplicated to most Indo-Aryan 
languages.  The motivation is that a CP may be 
translated as a direct verb in other languages, 
and POS Projection across Parallel Corpora 
then project a tag of Verb for this expression in 
the source language. Additional linguistic 
constraints are used to determine if the multi-
word cluster qualifies as a CP.  These include a 
check list of LVs that can occur with A, N, V 
and Adv constituents of a multi word 
predicate.  
Let us consider some examples from the CP 
lexicon constructed from the EMILLE parallel 
corpus (McEnery et al, 2000) of 200,000 
words, collected from leaflets prepared by the 
UK government for immigrants.  Examples of 
these different complexes may be: 
 
 
(1) N+V:  ????? + ??   varNan kar 
  ?description + do?: 
 
?????  ??   ???????     ?????????       ?? ?   ????  
paikej     yaa    prastut     ishtehaar        mein    jaise   
package   or    present     advertisement  in       as  
 
?????   ????   ???      ??,     ???     ????    
varNan     kiyaa   gayaa       ho       ThIk        vaisaa  
description do-past go-past be-pres exact  same 
 
??      ???? 
hii         hogaa 
emph    be-fut 
 
?It will be exactly as described on the package 
or the display advertisement.? 
  
(2) A+V: ??????? ?? upalabdh hai  
 ?available+ be?:   
 
??????   ????      ??      ???????        ???  
Sahaytaa   samiip          hii       upalabdh              hai  
Help         near        emph     available      be-pres 
 
?Help is available nearby.? 
 
(3) V+V :  ??? ??  soch le  ?think+take?: 
 
????  ??  ????  ??  ????   ?? ?   ??????    ???  
Pahle  har  pehluu  ke  baare-mein   achchhi    tarah  
First    every aspect-poss   about         good    way 
 
???     ????? ? 
soch      liijiye 
think      take-imp-hon 
 
?Think it through first.? 
 
(4) Adv+V  vaapas paa   ?return+obtain? 
 
??   ?????    ?????  ?? ? ????   ????     ????  
Aap  saamaan   badalne    mein  apne  puure  paise 
You   goods exchange-nom in      your   all     money 
 
????   ????   ??  ??????   ??    ????    ??? ?  
vaapas   paane   kaa     adhikar     kho    dete    hai  
return obtain-nom of      right      lose   give  be-pres     
 
?You loose your right to get your full money 
back in exchanging the goods. ? 
29
Of the four classes cited above, the NV and 
AV classes are the most productive. The AdvV 
class is highly restricted, confined to a few 
adverbs. The VV class is highly selective for 
its constituents, apparently driven by semantic 
considerations.  
Identifying CPs in text is crucial to 
processing since it serves as a clausal head, 
and other elements in the phrase are licensed 
by the complex as a whole and not by the 
verbal head.  The semantic import of the host-
verb complex varies along a composability 
continuum, at one end of which we have 
purely idiomatic CPs, while at the other end, 
the CPs may be recoverable from its 
constituents.  For example, ?????????+???, 
vyavhaar kar, "behave+do" has a sense of 
"use,treat" in English, reflecting clearly an 
idiomatic usage.   
Detecting CPs is made difficult by the 
differing degrees of productivity for different 
classes of open-class host, which reflects the 
applicability of unrestricted rules.  Also, verbs 
participating in CPs are very selective; e.g. in 
NV and AV CPs the verb is typically restricted 
to ho, kar and the like, whereas in VV 
constructs ho reflects auxiliary usage, but a 
different set of verbs appear. The open class 
word (host) tends to be uninflected, and only 
the light verb (LV) carries tense, agreement 
and aspect markers.  Even the host V 
participating in a VV CP is always uninflected. 
As an instance of the difficulty in detecting 
CPs, consider the so called permissive CP 
(Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003), as in the 
karne+de ?do-nom +give? example here, 
where the host verb appears to be  inflected:  
 
(5)  Raam ne sitaa ko   kaam  karne     diyaa 
      Ram-erg  sita-acc  work  do-nom  give-past 
       ?Ram let Sita do the work?  
 
However, this does not actually reflect CP 
usage, and is better parsed as:  
 
(6) [S [NP raam ne] [VP [NP sitaa ko]                    
[VP kaam karne] [V  diyaa] VP] S] 
 
Another challenge for CP identification is 
that the constituents may be separated ? 
sometimes quite widely.   
3 CPs from Parallel Projection  
Identifying MWEs from corpora is clearly 
an area of increasing research emphasis. For 
resource-rich languages, one may use a parse 
tree and look for mutual information statistics 
in head-complement collocations, and also 
compare it with other "similar" collocations to 
determine if something is unusual about a 
given construct (Lin, 1999). As of now 
however, even POS-tagging remains a 
challenge for languages such as Hindi, thereby 
making it necessary to seek alternate methods. 
Parallel corpus based approaches to 
inducing monolingual part-of-speech taggers, 
base noun-phrase bracketers, named-entity 
taggers and morphological analyzers for 
French, Chinese and other languages have 
shown quite promising results (Yarowsky et 
al., 2001). These approaches use minimal 
linguistic input and have been increasingly 
effective with the growth in the availability of 
large parallel corpuses. The algorithm 
essentially attempts to word-align the target 
language sentences with the source language 
sentences and then use a probabilistic model 
try to project the linguistic information from 
the source language. Since these are statistical 
algorithms, the accuracy of results depends on 
the size of the corpus used.  
In our approach, we first use a similar 
approach to word-align an English-Hindi 
parallel corpus. The English sentences are 
tagged and the tags are projected to Hindi 
sentences. We observe that words which are 
tagged as verbs by projection and have POS 
tag as N, A, Adv or V in the Hindi lexicon, and 
are followed by an LV, are usually CPs.  
Clearly the CP detection is limited to those 
instances where a CP in the target language is 
translated as a single verb in English.  For 
example, a phrase such as ???? ??, jawaab de, 
"answer give", may be rendered in English 
either as the verb ?answer? or as the English 
CP "give answer".  In the latter case (an 
example appearing quite frequently in this 
corpus), the correct POS projection would 
label jawaab as [N answer], thus failing to 
detect the CP.  While this may not be 
significant in certain tasks (e.g. translation), it 
may be relevant in others (e.g. semantic 
processing).  
 
 
 
30
Furthermore, the POS tagging process is 
inherently biased towards projecting tags for 
frequently encountered constituents first, and 
this may lead to some constituents in certain 
CPs being flagged with their normal POS tags, 
resulting in missed CPs. However, this does 
not result in false positives, since non-CP 
constructs often fail on other criteria (e.g. list 
of LVs). 
For reasons discussed above, many CPs are 
not identifiable through parallel corpus 
methods.  Some examples include ??????? 
?????, ????? ?????, ????? ?????. Our database 
is therefore correspondingly thin for these 
types of CPs.  
With VV CPs, it is difficult to distinguish 
between CPs and other related structures such 
as the passive construct or serial verbs. These 
are illustrated below.  
 
(7) Passive 
 
???  ??   ??  ????  ??    ??  ?????  ???  
Aisa   bhii    ho   saktaa   hai      ki      credit  note 
 It     emph   be    can     aux     that   credit  note 
 
?????   ???   ??    ???? ?  ??   ???    ?? ? 
siraf      kuch    hii      dino         tak    kaam     me 
only       few    emph   days       for     use       in 
 
????    ??   ????   ?? ? 
laaya     jaa     sakta     ho 
bring    go       can       be  
 
?It is quite possible that the credit note can be 
put to use only for a few days.? 
 
(8) Serial verb 
 
??   ????  ????  ???? ?????   ??  ??? ? 
voh   laDkaa   mujhe  apni   kitaab     de   gayaa 
That    boy      me       own    book    give  go-past 
 
?That boy gave me his book and went away.? 
 
It appears that passive can be reliably ruled 
out using the root verb criterion for VVs, since 
the main verb in passive is always in an 
inflected form. No comparable formal criterion 
exists for the serial verb, where also the POS 
tagger will identify both constituents as verbs.  
However, these verbs are relatively rare 
compared to CPs.  
4 Hindi-English POS Projection  
4.1 Data Resources and Preprocessing  
We used the EMILLE1 corpus Hindi-English 
parallel corpus, with approximately 200,000 
words in non-sentenced aligned translations in 
Unicode 16 format (McEnery et al, 2000). The 
texts consist of different types of information 
leaflets originally in English, along with 
translations in Hindi, Bangla, Gujarati and a 
number of South Asian languages. Closer 
analysis of the corpus reveals that the corpus is 
not completely sentence aligned and also that 
the translations are not very correct in many 
cases. Hindi versions of the manuals tend to be 
more verbose than their English translations.  
For the word alignment algorithm we 
needed a sentence aligned corpus but due to 
the small size of the parallel corpus, the 
standard sentence alignment systems did not 
give very high accuracy levels. Therefore, the 
whole data was manually sentence aligned to 
produce a sentence aligned parallel corpus of 
about nine thousand sentences and 140 
thousand words which is used in this work. 
4.2 Word alignment 
We have used IBM models proposed by 
Brown (Brown et al, 1993) for word aligning 
the parallel corpus. The IBM models have 
been widely used in statistical machine 
translation. Given a Hindi sentence h, we seek 
the English sentence e that maximizes P(e | h); 
the "most likely? translation.  
 
Now P (e | h) = P (e) * P (h | e) / P (h) 
argmax-e P(e | h) = argmax-e P(e) * P(h | e). 
 
P (e) is modeled by the N-gram model .We are 
interested in P (h | e). We used the Giza++ tool 
kit (Och and Ney, 2000), based on the 
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, to 
calculate these probability measures. At the 
end of this step, we have a word-to-word 
mapping between the English and Hindi 
sentences. A "NULL" is used in the English 
sentences to account for the unaligned Hindi 
words from the corresponding Hindi sentence.

Figure 1. Example of projection of POS tags from English to Hindi.  Here the phrase "shikaayat kar" is projected 
from the English "complain" and is tagged as V+V.  Since shikaayat is a N in the Hindi lexicon, this phrase is 
identified as an CP of N+V type. 
 
 
4.3 Tagging English Sentences 
The English sentences are POS-tagged using 
the Brill Tagger (Brill, 1994), a rule based 
tagger which uses more or less the same tags 
as the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, 1994). 
Since for our purposes, we did not need a very 
detailed subcategorization of the tag set for 
Hindi, the English tag set was reduced by 
merging the subcategorization tags of a few 
categories. Thus  all noun distinctions in the 
Pen Treebank tagset based on number, person 
etc  were merged in our treatment of the Noun 
class. Similarly in the case of verbs, we 
merged distinctions based on tense, person, 
aspect and participles etc. Subclasses of 
adverbs and case forms of pronouns were also 
merged. Rest of the POS categories were 
retained.  The ?NULL? word in the English 
sentences, used for unaligned Hindi words in 
the parallel corpus, was given a ?NULL? tag. 
4.4 Projection of Tags to Hindi 
The reduced English tags were projected to 
Hindi words based on the word alignments 
obtained earlier. A sample alignment and 
tagged projection is shown in Figure 1. As the 
figure shows, postpositional markers, which 
are relatively more frequent in Hindi are 
mapped to the ?NULL? word in the English 
sentence.  
Since the amount of training data is very 
small, the statistical word alignment algorithm 
is not adequate enough to align all words 
correctly. To overcome this weakness, we 
apply some filtering conditions to remove 
alignment errors, especially in smaller 
sentences.  This filtering is based on two 
parameters: a) Fertility count (rf), which is 
defined as the number of Hindi words an 
English word maps to, and b) Acceptance level 
(k), defined as the number of words acceptable  
in a sentence with fertility count greater than 
equal to rf.  These two parameters are selected 
to minimize errors in the groundtruth sample-
set, and the resulting filtering heuristics used 
are presented in Table 1.  
 
Table-1. Filtering Criteria 
 Sentence 
Length 
 
Fertility 
Count(rf) 
 
Acceptance 
Level(k) 
 
1. 1-5 2 1 
2. 5-10 3 2 
3. 10-15 3 3 
4. 15-20 4 3 
5. 20-25 4 3 
6. 25-35 4 3 
7. 35+ 4 3 
4.5 Identification of CP?s 
After the filtering is done we observe that the 
CP?s are usually translated as a direct verb in 
English. So if the projected tag of a Hindi 
word is Verb and the normal POS tag of the 
word in the Hindi dictionary is N, A, V or Adv 
and the word is followed by one of the 
members from the LV set, then we classify the 
multi word expression as N+V, A+V, V+V, or 
Adv+V CP respectively.   
4.6 Fragments of the CP Lexicon 
A sample fragment of the CP lexicon is shown 
in Figure-2. The whole corpus is available 
online2. Since we do not have a very 
comprehensive Hindi dictionary we are not 
able to classify many CP?s that are identified 
in their respective class. On a test with 4400 
sentences we identified a total of 1439 CPs  
                                                     
2 The lexicon is available online at  
http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/language/CP-
database.htm

Figure 2. Example of the CP lexicon for ?shikaayat kr? 
 
 
 
 
with the following distribution:  N+V: 788, 
A+V: 107, Adv+V: 18 and V+V: 526.  
4.7 Errors in CP identification 
CP identification in the test data set 
involved certain ground truth decisions such as 
excluding verbal composites with regular 
auxiliary verb ??, hai corresponding to the 
English finite verb ?be? and the progressive 
????? raha ?-ing (progressive)?. CPs with 
idiomatic usage were included, and so were the 
CPs with a passive verb, although the latter 
were not counted in computational scores. The 
testing was done on a small set of about 120 
groundtruth sentences in which the CP?s were 
carefully identified manually. We get a 
precision of about 82.5% and a recall of 40% 
with our CP finding algorithm. If the idiomatic 
CPs is not considered the recall goes upto 
46%.   
Several types of errors are observed in the 
corpus-derived results.  A False Negative 
(missed CP) error arising due to the English 
complex predicate is shown in Figure 3. A 
number of False Positives arise due to 
inadequacy in the Hindi dictionary ? the online 
dictionary of Hindi we used was missing many 
lexemes. A further problem is homography ? 
e.g. the word kii (do-past) appears both as an 
possessive marker, as well as the past-tense 
form for the verb kara (do), occurring 
frequently (with jaa, go) in adjectival clause 
constructions. This has been mis-tagged in 
about one in ten instances (approx 0.2% cases), 
with hosts such as shikaayat (complaint), baat 
(talk), dekhvaal (looking-after), madad (help) 
etc. Similarly, the word un can appear as a 
noun (wool) or a pronoun (he). Furthermore, 
while considerable care was taken to manually 
sentence align the parallel corpus, a number of 
typos and other problems remain, some of 
them show up as false positives.  
4.8 Discontinuous CP identification 
In the results above, we have made no 
attempt to identify discontinuous CPs, i.e., 
instances where other phonological material 
intervenes between the constituents of a CP, 
As an example, consider  
(9) ???? ??, jaanch ho, ?inspection-be? 
 
???  ???  ??  ????   ????    ??  ?? 
agar   kaar  kii    jaanch    pahale   hii       ho 
if       car  poss  inspection earlier emph happen 
 
????      ?? ,   ??    ???????    ?????? ? 
 chuki       hai         to      report      mangiye  
comp. be-present  then  report    ask-imp-hon 
 
 ?If the car has already been inspected 
please ask to see the report.? 
 
These separated multi-word expressions 
constitute some of the most difficult problems 
for any language ? for example, one may 
compare these with English phrasal verbs like 
?give up?, which can sometimes occur in 
discontinuity. However, owing to the relatively 
free word order in Hindi, the discontinuous 
CPs in Hindi are separated by a variety of 
structures ranging from simple emphatic or 
focal particles and negation markers  to clausal 
33
 
Figure 3. Here the projection process fails to detect the CP "shikaayat karna" since the English translation is also 
CP "make complaint".  Improvements in MWE detection in English can possibly help reduce such errors. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. A verb in the source language, ?inspected? projects to jaanch (inspection)+ ho (be) + chukaa hai (aux),    
although they are separated by the phrase pahale-bhi (already).  Thus, using source and target languages 
together. the parallel projection method may have the potential for discovering discontinuous CPs as well.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constituents.  How these structures are to be 
encoded in a computational lexicon is a 
complex matter that takes us beyond CP 
identification (Villavicencio et al 2004). But 
while rule-based identification of such 
constructs is problematic, we feel that POS-tag 
projection holds considerable promise in this 
direction.   
In the algorithm above we have only 
considered the target language (Hindi) tags 
after the parallel tagging is completed.  If in 
addition, we also consider the source language 
tag and its radiation the CP probabilities may 
be redefined in a manner that helps capture 
some discontinuous CPs as well. Thus, if 
English ?complain? radiates to shikaayat and 
kara, the inherent CP can be detected even in 
the presence of an intermediate phrase.  An 
example from the POS-tagged data exhibiting 
discontinous CP detection is presented in 
Figure 4.   
5 Conclusion 
In this work we have presented a 
preliminary approach to a corpus-based 
lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on projecting 
POS tags across parallel English-Hindi 
corpora. Since the approach involves minimal 
linguistic analysis, it is easily extendable to 
other languages which exhibit similar CP 
constructs, provided the availability of a POS 
lexicon. 
Clearly, a number of problems will remain 
with any such approach.  The limitiations of 
the parallel POS tagging is that certain kinds of 
maps may never be found (as in parallel CPs in 
source and target languages).  On the other 
hand, some of our accuracies, we feel, would 
improve considerably given a larger parallel 
corpus and more refined use of a Hindi 
lexicon.   
In addition to the handling of discontinuous 
CPs hinted at above, another aspect that we 
would like to consider next is to tune some of 
the parameters of the parallel tagging 
algorithm, such as specifically tuning the 
distortion and fertility probabilities in 
situations (e.g. English verbs) that are likely to 
manifest CPs in Hindi.  
We feel that beyond the usefulness of this 
initial approach, the database of CPs 
constructed in this work may in itself be an 
important linguistic resource for Hindi.  
Furthermore, the approach can possibly be 
used to detect MWEs that radiate to a single 
lexical structure in another language, e.g. 
phrasal verbs in English.  
 
Acknowledgements We acknowledge a 
comment from an anonymous reviewer 
regarding discontinuous CPs which led us to 
investigate them (Figure 4 above).  However, it 
was not possible to report this important 
exception for the entire database.
