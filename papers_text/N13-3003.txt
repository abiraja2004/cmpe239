Abstract
TMTprime is a recommender system that fa-
cilitates the effective use of both transla-
tion memory (TM) and machine translation
(MT) technology within industrial language
service providers (LSPs) localization work-
flows. LSPs have long used Translation Mem-
ory (TM) technology to assist the translation
process. Recent research shows how MT sys-
tems can be combined with TMs in Computer
Aided Translation (CAT) systems, selecting
either TM or MT output based on sophis-
ticated translation quality estimation without
access to a reference. However, to date there
are no commercially available frameworks for
this. TMTprime takes confidence estimation
out of the lab and provides a commercially vi-
able platform that allows for the seamless inte-
gration of MT with legacy TM systems to pro-
vide the most effective (least effort/cost) trans-
lation options to human translators, based on
the TMTprime confidence score.
1 Introduction
Within the LSP community there is growing interest
in the use of MT as a means to increase automation
and reduce overall localisation project cost. When
high-quality MT output is available, translators see
significant productivity gains over translation from
scratch, but poor MT quality leads to frustration
and wasted time as suggested translations are dis-
carded in favour of providing a translation from
scratch. We present a commercially-relevant soft-
ware platform providing a translation confidence es-
timation metric and, based on this, a mechanism for
effectively integrating MT with TMs in localisation
workflows. The confidence metric ensures that only

those MT outputs that are guaranteed to require less
post-editing effort than the best corresponding TM
match are presented to the post-editor (He et al,
2010a). The MT is integrated seamlessly, and es-
tablished localisation cost estimation models based
on TM technologies still apply as upper bounds.
2 Related Work
MT confidence estimation and its relation to existing
TM scoring methods, together with how to make the
most effective use of both technologies, is an active
area of research.
(Specia, 2011) and (Specia et al, 2009, 2010) pro-
pose a confidence estimator that relates specifically
to the post-editing effort of translators. This re-
search uses regression on both the automatic scores
assigned to the MT and scores assigned by post-
editors and aims to model post-editors? judgements
of the translation quality between good and bad, or
among three levels of post-editing effort.
Our work is an extension of (He et al, 2010a,b,c),
and uses outputs and features relevant to the TM
and MT systems. We focus on using system exter-
nal features. This is important for cases where the
internals of the MT system are not available, as in
the use of MT as a service in a localisation work-
flow.1 Furthermore, instead of having to solve a
regression problem, our approach is based on solv-
ing an easier binary prediction problem (using Sup-
port Vector Machines) and can be easily integrated
into TMs. (He et al, 2010b) present a MT/TM seg-
ment recommender, (He et al, 2010c) a MT/TM n-
best list segment re-ranker and (He et al, 2010a) a
MT/TM integration method that can use matching
sub-segments in MT/TM combination. Importantly,
1(Specia et al, 2009) note that using glass-box features
when available, in addition to black-box features, offer only
small gains and also incur significant computational effort.

translators can tune the models for precision without
retraining the models.
Related research by (Simard and Isabelle., 2009)
focuses on combining TM information into an SMT
system for improving the performance of the MT
when a close match already exists within the TM.
(Koehn and Haddow, 2009) presents a post-editing
environment using information from the phrase-
based SMT system Moses.2 (Guerberof, 2009) com-
pares the post-editing effort required for TM and
MT output, respectively. (Tatsumi, 2009) studies the
correlation between automatic evaluation scores and
post-editing effort.
3 Translation Recommender
Figure 1: TMTprime Workflow
The workflow of the translation recommender is
shown in Figure 1. We train MT systems using a
significant portion of the training data and use these
models as well as TM outputs to obtain a recommen-
dation development data set. MT systems can be
either in-house, e.g. a Moses-based system, or ex-
ternally available systems, such as Microsoft Bing3
or Google Translate.4 For each sentence in the de-
velopment data set, we have access to the reference
as well as to the outputs for each of the MT and TM
systems. We then select the best MT (or TM) output
as the translation with the lowest TER score with
respect to the reference and label the data accord-
ingly. System-independent features for each trans-
lation output are fed as input to the SVM classi-
fier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The SVM classi-
fier outputs class labels and the class labels are con-
verted into confidence scores using the techniques
given in (Lin et al, 2007). Relying on system inde-
pendent black-box features has allowed us to build

a fully extendable platform that will allow any num-
ber of MT systems (or indeed TM systems) to be
plugged into the recommender with little effort.
4 Demo Description
Using the Amazon EC25 deployment as a back-end,
we have developed a front-end GUI for the system
(Figure 2). The interface allows the user to select
which of the available translation systems (whether
they be MT or TM) they wish to use within the rec-
ommender system. The user can input their own
pre-established estimated cost of post-editing, based
on error ranges. Typically the costs for post-editing
those translations which have a lower-error rate (i.e.
fewer errors) is less than the cost for post-editing
translations which have a greater number of errors,
as they are of lower quality. The user is requested to
upload a file for translation to the system.
Figure 2: TMTprime GUI
Once the user has selected their desired options,
the TMTprime platform provides various analysis
measures based on its recommendation engine, such
as how many segments from the input file are recom-
mended for translation by the various selected trans-
lation engines or TMs available. Based on the input
costs, it provides a visualisation of overall estimated
cost of either using an individual translation system
on its own, or using the recommender selecting the
best performing system on a segment-by-segment
basis. The TMTprime system is an implementa-
tion of a segment-based system selector selecting
the most appropriate available translation/TM sys-
tem for a given input. A snapshot of the results pro-
duced by TMTprime is given in Figure 3: the pie-
chart shows what percentage of segments are rec-
ommended from each of the translation systems; the
5http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
11
bar-graph gives an estimated cost of using a single
translation system alone and the estimated cost when
using TMTprime?s combined recommendation. The
estimated cost using TMTprime is lower when com-
pared to using a single MT or TM system alone
(in the worst case, it will be the same as the best-
performing single translation engine or TM system).
This estimated cost includes both the cost for trans-
lation (currently uniform cost for each translation
system) and the cost required for post-editing. For
example, if the MT is an in-house system the cost
of translation will be (close to) zero whereas there is
potentially an additional base cost for using an exter-
nal MT engine. Finally, the interface provides statis-
tics related to various confidence levels for different
translation outputs across the various translation and
TM systems.

5 Experiments and Results
Evaluation targets two objectives and is described
below.
5.1 Correlation with Automatic Metrics
TER and METEOR are widely-used automatic met-
rics (Snover et al, 2006; Denkowski and Lavie,
2011) that calculate the quality of translation out-
put by comparing it against a human translation,
known as the reference translation. Our data sets
for the experiment consist of English-French trans-
lation memories from the IT domain. In all instances
MT was carried out for English-French translations.
As we have access to the reference target language
translations for our test set, we are able to calculate
the TER and METEOR scores for the three trans-
lation outputs (here TM, MaTrEx (Dandapat et al,
2010) and Microsoft Bing). For each sentence in the
test set, TMTprime recommends a particular transla-
tion output with a certain estimated confidence level
without access to a reference. We measure Pearson?s
correlation coefficient (Hollander and Wolfe, 1999)
between the recommendation scores, TER scores
and METEOR scores (for all system outputs) in or-
der to determine how well the TMTprime prediction
score correlates with the widely used automatic eval-
uation metrics. Results of these experiments are pro-
vided in Table 1 which shows there is a negative cor-
relation between TMTprime scores and TER scores.
This shows that both TMTprime scores and TER
scores are moving in opposite directions, supporting
the claim that the higher the recommendation scores,
the lower the TER scores. As TER is an error score,
the lower the TER score, the higher the quality of
the machine translation output compared to its refer-
ence. On the other hand, TMTprime scores are pos-
itively correlated with METEOR scores which sup-
ports the claim that the higher the recommendation
scores, the higher the METEOR scores.
Pearson?s r TER METEOR
TMTprime -0.402 0.447
Table 1: Correlation with automatic metrics
The evaluation has been performed on a test data
set of 2,500 sentences. Both the correlations are sig-
nificant at the (p<0.01) level.
5.2 Correlation with Post-Editing time
This is the most important and crucial metric for the
evaluation. For this experiment we made use of post-
editing data captured during a real-world translation
task, for English-French in the IT domain.
Pearson?s r TER METEOR PE Time
TMTprime -0.122 0.129 -0.132
Table 2: Correlation with Post-Editing times
For testing, we collect the post-editing times for
MT outputs from two different translators using a
commercial computer-aided translation (CAT tool)
in a real-world production scenario. The data set
consists of 1113 samples and is different from the
one used in the correlation with automatic metrics.
12
Post-editing times provide a real measure of the
amount of post-editing effort required to perfect the
output of the MT system. For this experiment, we
took the output of the MT system used in the task to-
gether with the post-editing times and measured the
Pearsons correlation coefficient between the TMT-
prime recommendation scores and the post-editing
(PE) times (only for MT output from a single sys-
tem since this data set does contain PE times for
other translation outputs). In addition, we also re-
peated the previous experiment setup for finding the
correlation between the TMTprime scores and the
automatically-produced TER, METEOR scores for
this data set. The results are given in Table 2.
The results show that the confidence scores do
correlate with automatic evaluation metrics and
post-editing times. Although the correlations do not
seem as strong as before, the results are statistically
significant (p<0.01).
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We present a commercially viable translation recom-
mender system which selects the best output from
multiple TM/MT outputs. We have shown that our
confidence score correlates with automatic metrics
and post-editing times. For future work, we are
looking into extending and evaluating the system for
different language pairs and data sets.
