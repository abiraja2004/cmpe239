This last session of the Meeting was really two sub-sessions 
on two quite different opics. The session opened with two 
thought-provoking papers from M1T on what might be called a 
philosophy of building a spoken language system. 
The first paper, by Seneff, Hirschman and Zue, concerned the 
ATIS domain. The authors tate what seems, after it is pointed 
out, an obvious truth, but which too few system builders seem 
to understand: when attempting a project like ATIS, the time to 
worry about the kinds of interaction that will take place in a 
dialogue is at the very beginning of the project. The MIT ATIS 
system has not yet been fully designed, but the paper discusses, 
and gives some examples of, the kinds information exchange it
is going to have to handle. 
The second paper, by Hirsehman, Seneff, Goodine and 
Phillips, was of the same flavor, but in a more practical vein. It 
describes ome actual Natural Language improvements o the 
M1T Voyager system, having to do with merging of acoustic 
and grarnmatieal evidence during the tree-search part of the 
recognition algorithm. Some simple (new) ideas have already 
provided a 33% improvement in recognition score. 
In the discussion period, it was clear that questioners had no 
quarrel with the aims expressed by the talkers; all questions had 
to do with the architecture, the actual implementation, of the 
algorithms discussed in the papers. 
The final three papers were on prosody. Suggestions that 
prosody might be used in automatic speech understanding go 
back at least to the ARPA SUR project of the early 1970s; 
however no recognition system has actually ever used prosody. 
In the early days, when compute-time was a primary issue, the 
notion was that prosodic information could be used to order 
competing theories, and thus speed the search. Today, with 
computational resources faster and cheaper, the emphasis is on 
use of prosody for disambiguation. 
The papers in this sub-session reported work that is very 
early in the process of folding prosody into the recognition 
process; in fact, all three might be described as feasibility 
tests. None reported work in which prosodic information is 
automatically extracted from an unknown incoming utterance. 
The first paper, by Price, Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel and 
Fong, and the second by Wang and Hirschberg, are somewhat in 
the nature of thought experiments. Price et al are interested in
whether or not prosody actually can be used to disambiguate; 
they show that human listeners can indeed use it to some 
extent. Wang and Hirschberg show that in the ATIS domain, 
which is syntactically simple, it is possible to predict fairly 
well, given the text of a sentence, where intonation boundaries 
will occur. 
The third paper, by Wightman, Veilleux and Ostendorf, 
describes what comes closest o a practical experiment. Here, 
given incoming sentences where the words are known in 
advance, their algorithm measures certain phoneme durations, 
and uses them in a simple disambiguation task, with very 
encouraging results. 
Questions focused on three topics. The first was the 
statistical gathering of prosodic evidence. There was general 
agreement that there is not now any set of statistics on prosody 
from a large corpus. Further, since prosodic units are much 
longer than phonemes, for example, it wiU take a lot of text to 
get reliable estimates. It was thought hat some of the corpora 
now being collected will be large enough. It is perhaps of 
interest that there was no discussion of just what measurements 
we need to ffmd the distribution of. 
There was a question about whether 90% accuracy in prosody 
(reported in one of the papers) was good or bad. The fact that 
the question was asked, and that in the discussion there was no 
solid opinion on either side, is very revealing of our state of 
knowledge of prosody and its usefulness in automatic 
understanding of speech. 
The third topic was the general usefulness of prosody. 
Opinions expressed were that prosody is not just good for 
speeding up search; that when prosody can be successfuUy 
extracted from speech it will be a useful addition to the 
probabilistic recognition framework; and that in fact there are 
many situations in which prosody will be the only way to get at 
the true meaning of a spoken sentence.
