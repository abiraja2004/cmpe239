Abstract
This paper presents the preparation, resources,
results and analysis of the Infectious Diseases
(ID) information extraction task, a main task
of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011. The ID
task represents an application and extension
of the BioNLP?09 shared task event extrac-
tion approach to full papers on infectious dis-
eases. Seven teams submitted final results to
the task, with the highest-performing system
achieving 56% F-score in the full task, com-
parable to state-of-the-art performance in the
established BioNLP?09 task. The results in-
dicate that event extraction methods general-
ize well to new domains and full-text publi-
cations and are applicable to the extraction of
events relevant to the molecular mechanisms
of infectious diseases.
1 Introduction
The Infectious Diseases (ID) task of the BioNLP
Shared Task 2011 (Kim et al, 2011a) is an infor-
mation extraction task focusing on the biomolecu-
lar mechanisms of infectious diseases. The primary
target of the task is event extraction (Ananiadou et
al., 2010), broadly following the task setup of the
BioNLP?09 Shared Task (BioNLP ST?09) (Kim et
al., 2009).
The task concentrates on the specific domain of
two-component systems (TCSs, or two-component
regulatory systems), a mechanism widely used by
bacteria to sense and respond to the environment
(Thomason and Kay, 2000). Typical TCSs con-
sist of two proteins, a membrane-associated sensor
kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The
sensor kinase monitors changes in the environment
while the response regulator mediates an adaptive
response, usually through differential expression of
target genes (Mascher et al, 2006). TCSs have many
functions, but those of particular interest for infec-
tious disease researchers include virulence, response
to antibiotics, quorum sensing, and bacterial cell at-
tachment (Krell et al, 2010). Not all TCS functions
are well known: in some cases, TCSs are involved
in metabolic processes that are difficult to precisely
characterize (Wang et al, 2010). TCSs are of in-
terest also as drugs designed to disrupt TCSs may
reduce the virulence of bacteria without killing it,
thus avoiding the potential selective pressure of an-
tibiotics lethal to some pathogenic bacteria (Gotoh
et al, 2010). Information extraction techniques may
support better understanding of these fundamental
systems by identifying and structuring the molecu-
lar processes underlying two component signaling.
The ID task seeks to address these opportuni-
ties by adapting the BioNLP ST?09 event extraction
model to domain scientific publications. This model
was originally introduced to represent biomolecu-
lar events relating to transcription factors in human
blood cells, and its adaptation to a domain that cen-
trally concerns both bacteria and their hosts involves
a variety of novel aspects, such as events concerning
whole organisms, the chemical environment of bac-
teria, prokaryote-specific concepts (e.g. regulons as
elements of gene expression), as well as the effects
of biomolecules on larger-scale processes involving
hosts such as virulence.
26
2 Task Setting
The ID task broadly follows the task definition and
event types of the BioNLP ST?09, extending it with
new entity categories, correspondingly broadening
the scope of events, and introducing a new class of
events, high-level biological processes.
2.1 Entities
The ID task defines five core types of entities:
genes/gene products, two-component systems, reg-
ulons/operons, chemicals, and organisms. Follow-
ing the general policy of the BioNLP Shared Task,
the recognition of the core entities is not part of
the ID task. As named entity recognition (NER)
is considered in other prominent domain evaluations
(Krallinger et al, 2008), we have chosen to isolate
aspects of extraction performance relating to NER
from the main task of interest, event extraction, by
providing participants with human-created gold an-
notations for core entities. These annotations are
briefly presented in the following.
Mentions of names of genes and their products
(RNA and proteins) are annotated with a single
type, without differentiating between subtypes, fol-
lowing the guidelines of the GENIA GGP corpus
(Ohta et al, 2009). This type is named PRO-
TEIN to maintain consistency with related tasks
(e.g. BioNLP ST?09), despite slight inaccuracy
for cases specifically referencing RNA or DNA
forms. Two-component systems, consisting of two
proteins, frequently have names derived from the
names of the proteins involved (e.g. PhoP-PhoR
or SsrA/SsrB). Mentions of TCSs are annotated as
TWO-COMPONENT-SYSTEM, nesting PROTEIN an-
notations if present. Regulons and operons are col-
lections of genes whose expression is jointly regu-
lated. Like the names of TCSs, their names may de-
rive from the names of the involved genes and pro-
teins, and are annotated as embedding PROTEIN an-
notations when they do. The annotation does not
differentiate between the two, marking both with a
single type REGULON-OPERON.
In addition to these three classes relating to genes
and proteins, the core entity annotation recognizes
the classes CHEMICAL and ORGANISM. All men-
tions of formal and informal names of atoms, inor-
ganic compounds, carbohydrates and lipids as well
as organic compounds other than amino acid and nu-
cleic acid compounds (i.e. gene/protein-related com-
pounds) are annotated as CHEMICAL. Mentions of
names of families, genera, species and strains as
well as non-name references with comparable speci-
ficity are annotated as ORGANISM.
Finally, the non-specific type ENTITY1 is defined
for marking entities that specify additional details of
events such as the binding site in a BINDING event or
the location an entity moves to in a LOCALIZATION
event. Unlike the core entities, annotations of the
generic ENTITY type are not provided for test data
and must be detected by participants addressing the
full task.
2.2 Relations
The ID task involves one relation, EQUIV, defin-
ing entities (of any of the core types) to be equiv-
alent. This relation is used to annotate abbreviations
and local aliases and it is not a target of extraction,
but provided for reference and applied in evaluation,
where references to any of a set of equivalent entities
are treated identically.
2.3 Events
The primary extraction targets of the ID task are the
event types summarized in Table 1. These are a su-
perset of those targeted in the BioNLP ST?09 and its
repeat, the 2011 GE task (Kim et al, 2011b). This
design makes it possible to study aspects of domain
adaptation by having the same extraction targets in
two subdomains of biomedicine, that of transcrip-
tion factors in human blood cells (GE) and infectious
diseases. The events in the ID task extend on those
of GE in the inclusion of additional entity types
as participants in previously considered event types
and the introduction of a new type, PROCESS. We
next briefly discuss the semantics of these events,
defined (as in GE) with reference to the community-
standard Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al, 2000).
We refer to (Kim et al, 2008; Kim et al, 2009) for
the ST?09/GE definitions.
1In terms of the GENIA ontology, ENTITY is used to mark
e.g. PROTEIN DOMAIN OR REGION references. Specific types
were applied in manual annotation, but these were replaced
with the generic ENTITY in part to maintain consistency with
BioNLP ST?09 data and to reduce the NER-related demands
on participating systems by not requiring the assignment of de-
tailed types.

Table 1: Event types and their arguments. The type of entity allowed as argument is specified in parenthesis. ?Core en-
tity? is any of PROTEIN, TWO-COMPONENT-SYSTEM, REGULON-OPERON, CHEMICAL, or ORGANISM. Arguments
that can be filled multiple times marked with ?+?, non-mandatory core arguments with ??? (all additional arguments
are non-mandatory).
The definitions of the first four types in Table 1
are otherwise unchanged from the ST?09 definitions
except that GENE EXPRESSION and TRANSCRIP-
TION extend on the former definition in recogniz-
ing REGULON-OPERON as an alternative unit of ex-
pression. LOCALIZATION, taking only PROTEIN
type arguments in the ST?09 definition, is allowed
to take any core entity argument. This expanded
definition remains consistent with the scope of the
corresponding GO term (GO:0051179). BINDING
is similarly extended, giving it a scope largely con-
sistent with GO:0005488 (binding) but also encom-
passing GO:0007155 (cell adhesion) (e.g. a bac-
terium binding another) and protein-organism bind-
ing. The three regulation types (REGULATION,
POSITIVE REGULATION, and NEGATIVE REGULA-
TION) likewise allow the new core entity types as
arguments, but their definitions are otherwise un-
changed from those in ST?09, that is, the GENIA on-
tology definitions. As in these resources, regulation
types are used not only for the biological sense but
also to capture statements of general causality (Kim
et al, 2008). As in ST?09, all events of types dis-
cussed above require a Theme argument: only events
involving an explicitly stated theme (of an appropri-
ate type) should be extracted. All other arguments
are optional.
The PROCESS type, new to ID, is used to annotate
high-level processes such as virulence, infection and
resistance that involve infectious organisms. This
type differs from the others in that it has no manda-
tory arguments: the targeted processes should be ex-
tracted even if they have no explicitly stated partici-
pants, reflecting that they are of interest even without
the further specification. When stated, the involved
participants are captured using the generic role type
Participant. Figure 1 shows an illustration of some
of the the ID task extraction targets.
We term the first five event types in Table 1 taking
exactly one Theme argument as their core argument
simple events. In analysis we further differentiate
non-regulation events (the first seven) and regulation
(the last three), which is known to represent partic-
ular challenges for extraction in involving events as
arguments, thus creating nested event structures.
2.4 Event modifications
The ID task defines two event modification ex-
traction targets, NEGATION and SPECULATION.
These modifications mark events as being explic-
itly negated (e.g. virB is not expressed) or stated in
a speculative context (e.g. virB may be expressed).
Both may apply simultaneously. The modification
definitions are identical to the ST?09 ones, includ-
ing the representation in which modifications (un-
like events) are not assigned text bindings.
3 Data
The ID task data were newly annotated for the
BioNLP Shared Task and are not based on any previ-
ously released resource. Annotation was performed
by two teams, one in Tsujii laboratory (University
of Tokyo) and one in Virginia Bioinformatics Insti-
tute (Virginia Tech). The entity and event annotation

design was guided by previous studies on NER and
event extraction in a closely related domain (Pyysalo
et al, 2010; Ananiadou et al, 2011).
3.1 Document selection
The training and test data were drawn from the pri-
mary text content of recent full-text PMC open ac-
cess documents selected by infectious diseases do-
main experts (Virginia Tech team) as representative
publications on two-component regulatory systems.
Table 2 presents some characteristics of the corpus
composition. To focus efforts on natural language
text likely to express novel information, we excluded
tables, figures and their captions, as well as methods
sections, acknowledgments, authors? contributions,
and similar meta-content.
3.2 Annotation
Annotation was performed in two primary stages,
one for marking core entities and the other for events
and secondary entities. As a preliminary processing
step, initial sentence segmentation was performed
with the GENIA Sentence Splitter2. Segmentation
errors were corrected during core entity annotation.
Core entity annotation was performed from the
basis of an automatic annotation created using se-
lected existing taggers for the target entities. The

following tools and settings were adopted, with pa-
rameters tuned on initial annotation for two docu-
ments:
PROTEIN: NeMine (Sasaki et al, 2008) trained on
the JNLPBA data (Kim et al, 2004) with threshold
0.05, filtered to only GENE and PROTEIN types.
ORGANISM: Linnaeus (Gerner et al, 2010) with
?variant matching? for species names variants.
CHEMICAL: OSCAR3 (Corbett and Murray-Rust,
2006) with confidence 90%.
TWO-COMPONENT-SYSTEM: Custom regular ex-
pressions.
Initial automatic tagging was not applied for en-
tities of the REGULON-OPERON type or the generic
ENTITY type (for additional event arguments). All
automatically generated annotations were at least
confirmed through manual inspection, and the ma-
jority of the automatic annotations were revised in
manual annotation. Table 3 summarizes the tag-
ging performance of the automatic tools as measured
against the final human-annotated training and de-
velopment datasets.3
Annotation for the task extraction targets ? events
and event modifications ? was created entirely man-
ually without automatic annotation support to avoid
any possible bias toward specific extraction meth-
ods or approaches. The Tsujii laboratory team orga-

differences in annotation criteria (see e.g. (Wang et al, 2009))
and to data tagged using the ID task annotation guidelines not
being applied for training; training on the newly annotated data
is expected to allow notably more accurate tagging.

nized the annotation effort, with a coordinating an-
notator with extensive experience in event annota-
tion (TO) leading annotator training and annotation
scheme development. Detailed annotation guide-
lines (Pyysalo et al, 2011) extending on the GE-
NIA annotation guidelines were developed jointly
with all annotators and refined throughout the an-
notation effort. Based on measurements of inter-
annotator consistency between annotations indepen-
dently created by the two teams, made throughout
annotator training and primary annotation (exclud-
ing final corpus cleanup), we estimate the consis-
tency of the final entity annotation to be no lower
than 90% F-score and that of the event annotation to
be no lower than 75% F-score for the primary eval-
uation criteria (see Section 4).
3.3 Datasets and statistics
Initial annotation was produced for the selected sec-
tions (see Section 3.1) in 33 full-text articles, of
which 30 were selected for the final dataset as repre-
sentative of the extraction targets. These documents
were split into training, development and test sets of
15, 5 and 10 documents, respectively. Participants
were provided with all training and development set
annotations and test set core entity annotations. The
overall statistics of the datasets are given in Table 4.
As the corpus consists of full-text articles, it con-
tains a somewhat limited number of articles, but in
other terms it is of broadly comparable size to the
largest of the BioNLP ST corpora: the corpus word
count, for example, corresponds to that of a cor-
pus of approximately 800 PubMed abstracts, and the
core entity count is comparable to that in the ST?09
data. However, for reasons that may relate in part to
the domain, the event count is approximately a third
of that for the ST?09 data. In addition to having less
training data, the entity/event ratio is thus consider-
ably higher (i.e. there are more candidates for each
true target), suggesting that the ID data could be ex-
pected to provide a more challenging extraction task.
4 Evaluation
The performance of participating systems was
evaluated in terms of events using the standard
precision/recall/F-score metrics. For the primary
evaluation, we adopted the standard criteria defined
in the BioNLP?09 shared task. In brief, for deter-
mining whether a reference annotation and a pre-
dicted annotation match, these criteria relax exact
matching for event triggers and arguments in two
ways: matching of text-bound annotation (event
triggers and ENTITY type entities) allows limited
boundary variation, and only core arguments need to
match in nested event arguments for events to match.
For details of the matching criteria, please refer to
Kim et al (2009).
The primary evaluation for the task requires the
extraction of all event arguments (both core and ad-
ditional; see Table 1) as well as event modifications
(NEGATION and SPECULATION). This is termed
the full task. We additionally report extraction re-
sults for evaluation where both the gold standard ref-
erence data and the submission events are reduced
to only core arguments, event modifications are re-
moved, and resulting duplicate events removed. We
term this the core task. In terms of the subtask divi-
sion applied in the BioNLP?09 Shared Task and the
GE task of 2011, the core task is analogous to sub-
task 1 and the full task analogous to the combination
of subtasks 1?3.
5 Results
5.1 Participation
Final results to the task were successfully submitted
by seven participants. Table 5 summarizes the in-
formation provided by the participating teams. We
note that full parsing is applied in all systems, with
the specific choice of the parser of Charniak and
Johnson (2005) with the biomedical domain model
of McClosky (2009) and conversion into the Stan-
ford Dependency representation (de Marneffe et al,
2006) being adopted by five participants. Further,
five of the seven systems are predominantly machine
learning-based. These can be seen as extensions of
trends that were noted in analysis of the BioNLP

ST?09 participation. In system design choices, we
note an indication of increased use of joint models
as opposed to pure pipeline designs, with the three
highest-ranking systems involving a joint model.
Several participants compiled dictionaries of
event trigger words and two dictionaries of hedge
words from the data. Four teams, including the three
top-ranking, used the GE task corpus as supplemen-
tary material, indicating that the GE annotations are
largely compatible with ID ones (see detailed results
below). This is encouraging for future applications
of the event extraction approach: as manual annota-
tion requires considerable effort and time, the ability
to use existing annotations is important for the feasi-
bility of adaptation of the approach to new domains.
While several participants made use of support-
ing syntactic analyses provided by the organizers
(Stenetorp et al, 2011), none applied the analyses
for supporting tasks, such as coreference or entity
relation extraction results ? at least in cases due to
time constraints (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011).
5.2 Evaluation results
Table 6 presents the primary results by event type,
and Table 7 summarizes these results. The full
task requires the extraction of additional arguments
and event modifications and involves multiple novel
challenges from previously addressed domain tasks
including a new subdomain, full-text documents,
several new entity types and a new event category.

Nevertheless, extraction performance for the top
systems is comparable to the state-of-the-art results
for the established BioNLP ST?09 task (Miwa et al,
2010) as well as its repetition as the 2011 GE task
(Kim et al, 2011b), where the highest overall result
for the primary evaluation criteria was also 56% F-
score for the FAUST system (Riedel et al, 2011).
This result is encouraging regarding the ability of
the extraction approach and methods to generalize
to new domains as well as their applicability specifi-
cally to texts on the molecular mechanisms of infec-
tious diseases.
We note that there is substantial variation in the
relative performance of systems for different en-
tity types. For example, Stanford (McClosky et
al., 2011) has relatively low performance for simple
events but achieves the highest result for PROCESS,
while UTurku (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011) results
show roughly the reverse. This suggests further po-
tential for improvement from system combinations.

The best performance for simple events and for
PROCESS approaches or exceeds 70% F-score, ar-
guably approaching a sufficient level for user-facing
applications of the extraction technology. By con-
trast, BINDING and regulation events, found chal-
lenging in ST?09 and GE, remain problematic also
in the ID task, with best overall performance below
50% F-score. Only two teams, UTurku and Con-
cordU (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011), attempted to
extract event modifications, with somewhat limited
performance. The difficulty of correct extraction of
event modifications is related in part to the recursive
nature of the problem (similarly as for nested reg-
ulation events): to extract a modification correctly,
the modified event must also be extracted correctly.
Further, only UTurku predicted any instances of sec-
ondary arguments. Thus, teams other than UTurku
and ConcordU addressed only the core task extrac-
tion targets. With the exception of ConcordU, all
systems clearly favor precision over recall (Table 7),
in many cases having over 15% point higher preci-
sion than recall. This a a somewhat unexpected in-
version, as the ConcordU system is one of the two
rule-based in the task, an approach typically associ-
ated with high precision.
The five top-ranking systems participated also in
the GE task (Kim et al, 2011b), which involves a
subset of the ID extraction targets. This allows ad-
ditional perspective into the relative performance of
the systems. While there is a 13% point spread in
overall results for the top five systems here, in GE
all these systems achieved F-scores ranging between
50?56%. The results for FAUST, UMass and Stan-
ford were similar in both tasks, while the ConcordU
result was 6% points higher for GE and the UTurku
result over 10% points higher for GE, ranking third
after FAUST and UMass. These results suggest that
while the FAUST and UMass systems in particular
have some systematic (e.g. architectural) advantage
at both tasks, much of the performance difference
observed here between the top three systems and
those of ConcordU and UTurku is due to strengths
or weaknesses specific to ID. Possible weaknesses
may relate to the treatment of multiple core entity
types (vs. only PROTEIN in GE) or challenges re-
lated to nested entity annotations (not appearing in
GE). A possible ID-specific strength of the three
top-ranking systems is the use of GE data for train-
ing: Riedel and McCallum (2011) report an esti-
mated 7% point improvement and McClosky et al
(2011) a 3% point improvement from use of this
data; McGrath et al (2011) estimate a 1% point im-
provement from direct corpus combination. The in-
tegration strategies applied in training these systems

could potentially be applied also with other systems,
an experiment that could further clarify the relative
strengths of the various systems. The top-ranking
five systems all participated also in the EPI task
(Ohta et al, 2011), for which UTurku ranked first
with FAUST having comparable performance for the
core task. While this supports the conclusion that
ID performance differences do not reflect a simple
universal ranking of the systems, due to many sub-
stantial differences between the ID and EPI setups it
is not straightforward to identify specific reasons for
relative differences to performance at EPI.
Table 8 summarizes the core task results. There
are only modest and largely consistent differences to
the corresponding full task results, reflecting in part
the relative sparseness of additional arguments: in
the training data, for example, only approximately
3% of instances of event types that can potentially
take additional arguments had at least one additional
argument. While event modifications represent a
further 4% of full task extraction targets not required
for the core task, the overall low extraction perfor-
mance for additional arguments and modifications
limits the practical effect of these annotation cate-
gories on the performance difference between sys-
tems addressing only the core targets and those ad-
dressing the full task.
6 Discussion and Conclusions
We have presented the preparation, resources, re-
sults and analysis of the Infectious Diseases (ID)
task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011. A corpus
of 30 full-text publications on the two-component
systems subdomain of infectious diseases was cre-
ated for the task in a collaboration of event annota-
tion and domain experts, adapting and extending the
BioNLP?09 Shared Task (ST?09) event representa-
tion to the domain.
Seven teams submitted final results to the ID task.
Despite the novel challenges of full papers, four new
entity types, extension of event scopes and the intro-
duction of a new event category for high-level pro-
cesses, the highest results for the full ID task were
comparable to the state-of-the-art performance on
the established ST?09 data, showing that the event
extraction approach and present systems generalize
well and demonstrating the feasibility of event ex-
traction for the infectious diseases domain. Analy-
sis of results suggested further opportunities for im-
proving extraction performance by combining the
strengths of various systems and the use of other
event resources.
The task design takes into account the needs
of supporting practical applications, and its results
and findings will be adopted in future development
of the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center4
(PATRIC). Specifically, PATRIC will combine do-
main named entity recognition and event extraction
to mine the virulence factor literature and integrate
the results with literature search and retrieval ser-
vices, protein feature analysis, and systems such as
Disease View.5 Present and future advances at the
ID event extraction task can thus assist biologists in
efforts of substantial public health interest.
The ID task will be continued as an open
shared task challenge with data, supporting re-
sources, and evaluation tools freely available from
the shared task site, http://sites.google.
com/site/bionlpst/.
