In this paper, word sense dismnbiguation (WSD) ac- 
curacy achievable by a probabilistic lassifier, using 
very milfimal training sets, is investigated. \Ve made 
the assuml)tiou that there are no tagged corpora 
available and identified what information, needed by 
an accurate WSD system, can and cmmot be auto- 
matically obtained. The lesson learned can then be 
used to locus on what knowledge needs malmal an- 
notation. Our system, named Bayesian Hierarchical 
Disambiguator (BHD), uses the Internet, arguably 
tile largest corlms in existence, to address the st)arse 
data problem, and uses WordNet's hierarchy tbr se- 
mantic contextual features. In addition, Bayesian 
networks are automatically constructed to represent 
knowledge learned from training sets by lnodeling 
the selectional i)retbrence of adjectives. These net- 
works are then applied to disaml)iguation by per- 
tbrming inferences on unseen adjective-noun pairs. 
We demonstrate that this system is able to disam- 
biguate adjectives in um'estricl;ed text at good initial 
accuracy rates without tile need tbr tagged corpora. 
The learning and extensibility aspects of the model 
are also discussed, showing how tagged corpora and 
additional context can be incorporated easily to im- 
prove accm'acy, and how this technique can be used 
to disambiguate other types of word pairs, such as 
verb-noun and adverb-verb pairs. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) remains an open 
probleln in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Be- 
ing able to identify tile correct sense of an mnbigu- 
ous word is ilnportant for many NLP tasks, such as 
machine translation, information retrieval, and dis- 
course analysis. The WSD problem is exacerbated 
by the large number of senses of colmnonly used 
words and by the difficulty in determining relevant 
contextual features most suitable to the task. Tile 
absence of semantically tagged corpora makes prob- 
abilistic techniques, shown to be very effective by 
speech recognition and syntactic tagging research, 
difficult to employ due to the sparse data problem. 
Early NLP systeins limited their domain and re- 
quired manual knowledge ngineering. More recent 
works take advantage of machine readable dictio- 
naries such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) and Roget's 
Online Thesaurus. Statistical techniques, both su- 
pervised learning from tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 
1992), (Ng and Lee, 1.996), and unsupervised learn- 
ing (Yarowsky, 1995), (Resnik, 1997), have been in- 
vestigated. There are also hybrid inodcls that in- 
corporate both statistical and symbolic knowledge 
(Wiebe et al, 1998), (Agirre and I{igau, 1996). 
Supervised models have shown promising results, 
but the lack of sense tagged corpora often requires 
the need tbr laboriously tagging trailfing sets man- 
ually. Depending on the technique, unsupervised 
models can result in ill-defined senses. Many have 
not been evaluated with large vocabularies or flfll 
sets of senses. Hybrid models, using various heuris- 
tics, have demonstrated good accuracy but are ditfi- 
cult to compare clue to variations in the evahlation 
procedures, as discussed in Resnik and Yarowsky 
(\]997). 
In our Bayesian Hierarchical Disambiguator 
(BHD) model, we attempt to address some of the 
main issues faced by today's WSD systelns, namely: 
1) the sparse data problem; 2) the selection of a 
fi;ature set that can be trained upon easily without 
sacrificing accuracy; and 3) the scalability of the sys- 
tein to disambiguate um'estricted text. The first two 
problems can be attributed to the lack of tagged 
corpora, while the third results from the need for 
lland-annotated text as a method of circumventing 
the first two problems. We will address the first two 
issues by identiflying contexts in which knowledge 
can be obtained automatically, as opposed to those 
that require minimal manual tagging. The effective- 
hess of the BHD model is then tested on unrestricted 
text, thus addressing the third issue. 
2 Prob lem Formulat ion  
WSD can t)e described as a classification task, 
where the i th sense (W#i )  of a word (W) is clas- 
sified as the correct tag, given a word and usually 
some surrounding context. For example, to disam- 
biguate the adjective "great" in the sentence "Tile 
152 
great hm'riealm devastated the region", a \VSI) sys- 
tem should disambiguate "great" as left.q(: in .s'izc 
rather than the good or c:cccllent meaning. Us- 
ing l)robability notations, this t)rocedure can be 
st~ted as maxi(Pr(great#i \[ "great", "ihe", "lnn'- 
ricane", "devastated", "the", "region")). That is, 
given the word "great" and its context, elassit~y the 
sense great#/  with the highest probability as the 
correct  o11e. However, a large COllteX\[;~ sll(:h as the 
whole sentence, is rarely used, due to the dilliculty 
in estimating the 1)robability of this particular set of 
words oceurring. Therefore, the context is usually 
narrowed, such as ,z number of surromMing words. 
Additionally, surrollnding syntactic tbatures aim se- 
mantic knowledge are sometimes used. The diffi- 
culty is in choosing the right context, or the set 
of features, that will ol)timize the classification. A 
larger (:ontext intl)roves t;11(! classiti(:ation a(:(:ura(:y al 
the exl)ense of increasing the mlml)er of l)arameters 
(typically learned fr(nn large training data). 
in our BHI) model, a minimal context (:Oml)OSe(l 
of only the adje(:tive, noun and the llOllll;S Sel l lal l -  
tie features obtained fl'()m \VordNel is used. Us- 
ing the al)ove examl)le , only "great", "hurri(:ane" 
and hun'icane's t)atures encoded in WordNet's hi- 
erarchy, as in hurricane lISA cyclone lISA wind- 
storm ISA violent storm..., are used its (;Olltext. 
Therefore, the classitieation 1)ertbrnmd 1)y Bil l) (:an 
t)e written as nlaxi(lh(great?~i \[ "great", "\]nlrri-

are used to l)uiht a belief about the nouns ,:ill adjec- 
tive SellSe typically lnodifies, i.e., the se\]ectional pref- 
erences of a(ljectiv('.s. For examlfle , having learned 
about lmrrieane, the system can infer the most prob- 
able dismnbiguation of "great typhoon", "great tor- 
nado", or ltlore distal concepts uch as earthquakes 
and tloods. 
3 Establishing the Parameters 
As shown in equation 1, BH1) requires 
two parameters: 1) the likelihood term 
Pr(adj, noun,< NFs  > ladj#i) and 2) the prior 
term Pr(ad j#i ) .  The prior term represents the 
knowledge of how frequently a sense of an adjective 
is used without any contextual infornmtion. Dn" 
example, if great#2 (sense: 9ood, excellent) is 
nsed frequently while great#l  is less commonly 
used, then Pr(great#2) wtmld be larger than 
Pr (great#l ) ,  in l)rOl)ortion to the usage of the 
two senses. Although WordNet orders the senses 
of a t)olysenl(ms word according to usage, the 
actual t)rot)ortions are not quantified. Therefore, to 
(:omtmte the priors, one can iterate over all English 
nouns and sunl the instmlces of great#l-noun 
versus great#-2-noun t)airs. But siilce we assume 
that no training set exists (the worst possible ease 
of the sparse data l)rol)lem), these counts need to 
1)e estinmted from ilMireet sources. 
3.1 The Sparse  Data  P rob lem 
The techuique used to address data sI)arsity, as first 
proposed by Mihalcea and Moldovan (1998), treal;s 
the Internet as a cortms to automatically (lisam- 
biguate word 1)airs. Using the previous examl)le , to 
disambiguate he adjective in "great hurricane", two 
synonym lists of ("great, large, t)ig") and ("great, 
neat, good") are retrieved from V?ordNet. (SOllle 
synonyms ~111(1 el;her SellSeS i/re olllitted here for 
1)revity.) Two queries, ("great hurricane" or "large 
hurrit:ane?' or "t)ig hurricane") and ("great hurri- 
cane" or "neat hurricane" or "good hurriemm"), are 
issued to Altavista, which reporl, s that 1100 and 914: 
1)ages contain these terlllS, respectively. The query 
with the higher count (#1) is classitied its the correct 
sense. For fllrther details, please refer to Mihaleca 
anti Moldovau (1998). 
In our luo(lel, the (:omd;s front Altavista are im:or- 
l)orated as \[)aralltel;er stilllatiollS within our proba- 
bilislh: frlt111(~work. Jill addition to disaml)igualing 
lhe adjectives, we also need to estimale lhe us- 
age of the a(ljec|;ive#i-noml pair. For simt)licil;y , 
the counts fronl Altavista are assigued wholesale 1o 
the disambiguated adjective sense, e.g., the usage 
of great#l-hurr icane is 1100 times and great#2- 
hurricane is zero times. This is a great simplifi- 
cation since in many adjective-noun pairs nmltil)le 
meanings are likely. For instance, in "great sl;eak", 
both sense of '"great" (large steak vs. tasty steak) 
are e, qually likely. However, given no other infor- 
mation, this sinlt)lification is used as a gross ap- 
t)roximation of Counts(adj#i-noun), which becoines 
Pr(adj#i-noun) by dividing the counts by a nornml- 
izing constant, ~ Com~ts(adj#i-all nouns). These 
prolmbilities are then used to compute the priors, 
described in the next section. 
Using this technique, two major probleins are ad- 
dressed. Not only are the adjectives automatically 
disambiguated, but the number of occurrenees of the 
word pairs is also estimated. The need lot haud- 
annotated semantic orpora is thus avoided. How- 
ever, the statistics gathered by this technique are 
at)proxinmtions, so the noise they introduce does re- 
quire supervised training to nfinimize error, as will 
lm described. 
153 
3.2 Comput ing  the Priors 
Using the methods described above, the priors cats 
be automatically computed by iterating over all 
nouns and smnnfing tile counts tbr each adjective 
sense. Untbrtunately, the automatic disambiguation 
of tim adjective is not reliable enough and results it, 
inaccurate priors. Therefore, manual classification 
of assigning nouns into one of the adjective senses 
is needed, constituting the first of two manual tasks 
needed by this model. However, instead of classi- 
fying all English nouns, Altavista is again used to 
provide collocation data on 5,000 nouns for each ad- 
jective. The collocation frequency is then sorted and 
the top 100 nouns are manually classified. For ex- 
ample, the top 10 nouns that collocate after "great" 
are "deal", "site", "job", "place", "time", "way", 
"American", "page", "book", and "work". They are 
then all classified as being modified by the great#2 
sense except for tile last one, which is classified into 
another sense, as defined by WordNet. Tim prior 
for each sense is then coinputed by smmning the 
counts Don, t)airing the adjective with the nouns 
classified into that sense and dividing by the sum 
of all adjective-noun pairs. The top 100 collocated 
nouns fbr each adjective are used as an al)proxima- 
tion for all adjective-noun pairs since considering all 
nouns would be impractical. 
To validate these priors, a Naive Bayes classifier 
that comt)utes 
v,.azi Pr(adj, ,!,o'l,r@,dj#i) x Pr(,,dj #i) 
Pr  ( a4i, ~o , .  ,. ) 
is used, with the noun as the only context. This 
simpler likelihood term is approxinmted by the same 
Internet counts used to establish the priors, i.e., 
Counts(adj#i-noun) / normalizing constant. In Ta- 
ble 1, the accuracy of disambiguating 135 adjective- 
noun pairs Dora the br-a01 file of the semantically 
tagged corlms SemCor (Miller et al, 1993) is com- 
pared to the baseline, wlfich was calculated by using 
the first WordNet sense of the adjective. As men- 
tioned earlier, disambiguating using, simply the high- 
est count Dot** Altavista ("Before Prior" it, Table 
1) achieved a low accuracy of 56%, whereas using 
the sense with the highest prior ("Prior Only") is 
slightly better than the baseline. This result vali- 
dates the fact that the priors established here pre- 
serve WordNet's ordering of sense usage, with tile 
improvement that tim relative usages between senses 
are now quantified. 
Combining both the prior and the likelihood terms 
did not significantly improve or degrade tile accu- 
racy. This would indicate that either the likelihood 
term is uniformly distributed across tile i senses, 
which is contradicted by the accuracy without the 
priors (second row) being significantly higher than 
the average number of senses per adjective of 3.98, 
Accur&cy 
Before Prior 56.3% 
Prior Only 77.0% 
Combined 77.8% 
Baseline 75.6% 
Table 1: Accuracy rates from using a Naive Bayes 
classifier to wflidate the priors. These results show 
that the priors established in this model are as ac- 
curate as the WordNet's ordering according to sense 
usage (Baseline). 
or, more likely that this parameter is subsumed by 
the priors due to the limited context. Therefore, 
more contextual infbrmation is needed to improve 
tim model's peribrmance. 
3.3 Contextual  Features 
Instead of adding other types of context such as 
the surrounding words and syntactic features, tlm 
semantic features of tim noun (as encoded in the 
WordNet ISA hierarchy) is investigated for its effec- 
tiveness. These features are readily available and are 
organized into a well-defined structus'e. Tim hierar- 
chy provides a systematic and intuitive method of 
distance measurements between feature vectors, i.e., 
the semantic distance between concepts. This prop- 
erty is very important for inthrring the classification 
of the novel pair "great flood" into the sense tha.t 
contains hurricane as a member of its prototypical 
nouns. These prototypical nouns describe tile se- 
lectional preferences of adjective senses of "great", 
and the semantic distance between them and a new 
noun ineasures 1;11o "semantic fit" between the con- 
cepts. Tile closer the.y are, as with "hurricane" and 
"flood", the higher the prot)ability of the likelihood 
term, whereas distal concepts uch as "hurricane" 
and "taste" would have a lower value. 
Representing these prototyt)ical 11011218 prot)abilis- 
tically, however, is difficult due to the exponential 
number of 1)robal)ilit, ies with respect o the nmnber 
of features. For exmnl)le, ret)resenting hurricmm 1)e- 
ing I)resent in a selectional t)reference list requires 
2 s probabilities ince there are 8 features, or ISA 
l)arents, in the WordNet hierarchy. It, addition , tile 
sparse data t)roblem resurfaces because ach one of 
the 2 s probabilities has to l)e quantified. To ad- 
dress these two issues, belief networks are used, as 
described it, detail in the next section. 
4 Probab i l i s t i c  Network 's  
There are many advantages to using Bayesian net- 
works over the traditional probabilistic models. The 
most notable is that the mlmber of probabilities 
needed to represent he distribution can be signif 
icantly reduced by making independence assump- 
tions between variables, with each node condition-

of the networks in BHD can be divided into three 
steps: defining 1) the training sets, 2) the structure, 
and 3) the probabil it ies, as described in the tbllowing 
sections.

4.2 Be l ie f  Network  S t ruetm'e  
The belief networks have the same structure as the 
\VordNet 1SA hierarchy with the ext;et)tion that the 
edges are direcl;ed from the child nodes to their par- 
ents. I lhlstrated in Figure 2, the BItD-eonstructed 
network represents the selectional t)referelme of the 
to I) level nod(;, great#l .  The leaf nodes are tile evi- 
(len(:e nodes from the training set mM the internm(li-

node during inferencing, as described in a later sec- 
LioIl. 1}11|; first, th(' l)robability table ae(:oml)anyiug 
ea(:h node needs to be constructed. 
155 
4.3 Quanti fy ing the Network 
The two parameters the belief networks require are 
the CPTs tbr each intermediate node and the pri- 
ors of the leaf nodes, such as P(great#l ,  hurri- 
cane). The latter is estilnated by tile counts ob- 
tained fronl Altavista, as described earlier, and a 
shortcut is used to specit~y the CPTs. Normally 
the CPTs ill a flflly specified Bayesian etwork con- 
tain all instantiations of the child and parent values 
and their corresponding probabilities. For example, 
the CPT at node D in Figure 1 would have four 
rows: e r (D=t lE : t ) ,  Pr (D=t lE=f) ,  Pr(D=flE=t) ,  
and Pr (D=f lE=f  ). This is needed to perform flfll 
inferencing, where queries can be issued for any in- 
stantiation of the variables. However, since the net- 
works in this model are used only for one specific 
query, where all nodes are instantiated to be true, 
only the row with all w~riables equal to true, e.g., 
Pr (D=t lE=t) ,  has to be specified. The nature of 
this query will be described in more detail in tile 
next section. 
To calculate the probability that an intermediate 
node and all of its parents are true, one divides the 
number of parents present by the number of possi- 
ble parents as specified ill WordNet. hi Figure 2, 
the small clotted nodes denote the absent parents, 
which deternfine how the probabilities are specified 
at each node. Recall that tile parents in the belief 
network are actually the children in the. WordNet 
hierarchy, so this probability can be seen as the per- 
centage of children actually present, hltuitively, this 
probability is a form of assigning weights to parts of 
the network where more related nouns are present 
in the training set, silnilar to the concept of seman- 
tic density. Tile probability, in conjunction with the 
structure of the belief network, also implicitly en- 
codes the semantic distance between concepts with- 
out necessarily 1)enalizing concepts with deep hier- 
archies. A discount is taken at each ancestral node 
during inferencing (next section) only wlmn some 
of its WordNet children are absent in the network. 
Therefore, the semantic distance can be seen as the 
number of traversals 11I) the network weighted by the 
number of siblings present in tile tree (and not by 
direct edge counting). 
4.4 Querying the Network 
With the probability between nodes specified, the 
network becomes a representation of the selectional 
prefbrence of an adjective sense, with features from 
the WordNet ISA hierarchy providing additional 
knowledge on both semantic densities and semantic 
distances. To disambiguate a novel adjective-noun 
pair such as "great flood", the great#l  and great#2 
networks (along with 7 other great#/networks  not 
shown here) infer the likelihood that "flood" be- 
longs to the network by comtmting the probability 
Pr(great, flood, <flood NFs>, proto nouns, <l)roto 
NFs> I adj #i), even though neither network has ever 
encountered the noun "flood" before. 
To perform these inferences, the noun and its fea- 
tures are tenlporarily inserted into the network ac- 
cording to the WordNet hierarchy (if not already 
present). The prior for this "hypothetical evidence" 
is obtained the same way as the training set, i.e., by 
querying Altavista, and the CPTs are updated to 
reflect this new addition. To calculate the probabil- 
ity at the top node, any Bayesian network inferenc- 
ing algorithm can be used. However, a query where 
all nodes are instantiated to true is a special case 
since the probability can be comlmted by multiply- 
ing together all priors and the CPT entries where all 
variables are true. 
Ill Figure 3, tile network for g reat#l  is shown with 
"flood" as tile hypothetical evidence added on the 
right. The CPT of the node "natural phenomenon" 
is updated to reflect the newly added evidence. The 
propagation of the probabilities from the leaf nodes 
up the network is shown and illustrates how dis- 
counts art taken at each intermediate node. When- 
ever more related concepts are 1)resent in the net- 
work, such as "typhoon" and "tornado '~, less dis- 
counts are taken and thus a higher probability will 
result at the root node. Converso.ly, one can see that 
with a distal concept, such as "taste" (which is ill a 
completely different branch), the knowledge about 
"hurricane" will have little or no influence on dis- 
ambiguating "great taste". 
The calculation above can be computed in linear 
time with respect to the det/th of tlle query noun 
node (depth=5 in the case of f lood#l)  and not the 
the nmnber of nodes ill the network. This is impor- 
tant for scaling the network to represent the large 
nuinber of nouns needed to accurately model tile se- 
lectional preferences of adjective senses. Tile only 
cost incurred is storage for a summary probability 
of the children at each internlediate node and time 
for ut)dating these values when a new piece of evi- 
dence is added, which is also linear with respect o 
the depth of the node. 
Finally, the probabilities comt)uted by the infer- 
ence algorithnl are combilmd with the priors estab- 
lished in the earlier section. Tile combined proba- 
bilities represent P(adj#i  \] adj, noun, <NFs>),  and 
tilt one with the highest probability is classified by 
BHD as tile most plausible sense of the adjective.

To test the accuracy of BHD, the same procedure 
described earlier was used. Tile same 135 adjective- 
noun pairs from SelnCor were disambiguated by 
BHD and compared to the baseline. Table 2 shows 
the accuracy results froln evaluating either the first 
sense of the nouns or all senses of the nouns. The re-

5 Conc lus ion  and  Future  Work  
We have 1)resenl;etl a t)rol}~fl}ilistic disanfl}iguation 
model that  ix sysl;e, ln~l;i{,, a(tcllral;e, all(l require llHlll- 
ual intervention ill only ill two places. The more 
l;illle (:OllSlllllill~ of tim l;wo manual l;asks is to (:\]as- 
sitS' th(~ toll 100 nouns needed for the priors. The 
el;her task~ of disanfl)igual;ing l)rol;olTpical lOllllS, is 
relal;ively simple due to the limited nunfl)er of glos- 
sary nouns per sense. IIowever, it would l}e straight- 
forward to incorporate semantically tagged corpora, 
such as SemCor, to avoid these mamml tasks. The 
priors are the number  of instances of each adjective 
sense divided by all of the adjectives in the corpus. 
The disambiguated adjectiveT~i-noun#.\] pairs from 
the corpus ean be used as training sets to build bet- 
{e,r ret/resental;ion of selectional preferences l}y in- 
serting tim nounT~j node mid the ac(:omf}any featm'es 
into the l}elief network of a{ljectivegfii. The insertion 
is the same prot:c/hue used to add the hyllothe|;ical 
evidence dm'ing the inferoncing stage. The Ul)(lated 
belief networks could then be, used tbr disambigua- 
lion wii;h improve.d at:curacy. Furthernlore, the per- 
formance of BI ID (:(mid a.lso be improved by exl)and- 
157 
ing the context or using statistical learning methods 
such as the EM algorithln (DemI)ster et al, 1977). 
Using Bayesian networks gives the model ttexibility 
to incorporate additional contexts, such as syntac- 
tical and morphological features, without incurring 
exorbitant costs. 
It is l)ossible that, with an extended model that 
accurately disambiguates adjective-noun pairs, the 
selectional preference ofadjective senses coutd be au- 
tomatically learned. Having all improved knowledge 
al)out the selectional 1)references would then provide 
better parameters for disanfl)iguation. The model 
can be seen as a bootstrapping learning process tbr 
disambiguation, where the information gained from 
one part (selectional preference) is used to improve 
tile other (disambiguation) and vice versa, reminis- 
cent of the work by Riloff and Jones (1.999) and 
Yarowsky (1995). 
Lastly, the techniques used in this paper could be 
scaled to disambiguate not only all adjective-noun 
pairs, but also other word pairs, such as subject- 
verb, verb-object, adverb-verb, y obtaining most of 
the paraineters from the Internet and WordNet. If 
the information fi'oln SemCor is also used, then the 
system could be automatically trained to pertbrm 
disambiguation tasks on all content words within a 
SellteI1Ce. 
In this paper, we have addressed three of what we 
believe to be the main issues timed 1)y current WSD 
systems. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
teclmiques used, while identii~ying two mmmal tasks 
that don't necessarily require a semantically tagged 
corpus. By establishing accurate priors a.nd small 
training sets, our system achieved good initial dis- 
ambiguation accuracy. The salne methods could 1)e 
flflly automated to disami)iguate all content word 
pairs if infbrmation from semantically tagged cor- 
pora is used. Our goal is to create a system that can 
disambiguate all content words to an accuracy level 
sufficient for automatic tagging with tummn valida- 
tion, which could then be used to improve or fa- 
cilitate new probabilistic semantic taggers accurate 
enough for other NLP applications.
