ABSTRACT 
This paper describes a recently collected spoken language cor- 
pus for the ATIS (Air Travel Information System) domain. 
This data collection effort has been co-ordinated by MAD- 
COW (Multi-site ATIS Data COllection Working group). We 
summarize the motivation for this effort, the goals, the imple- 
mentation of a multi-site data collection paradigm, and the 
accomplishments of MADCOW in monitoring the collection 
and distribution of 12,000 utterances of spontaneous speech 
from five sites for use in a multi-site common evaluation of 
speech, natural anguage and spoken language. 
1. Introduction 
Following the February 1991 DARPA Speech and Natu- 
ral Language Workshop, the DARPA Spoken Language 
contractors decided to institute a multi-site data collec- 
tion paradigm in order to: 
? support a common evaluation on speech, natural 
language and spoken language; 
? maximize the amount of data collected; 
? provide some diversity in data collection paradigms; 
? reduce cost to any one site by sharing the data col- 
lection activity across multiple participating sites. 
To co-ordinate this effort, MADCOW was formed in May 
1991 with a representative from each of the participat- 
ing sites. This included the six sites planning to collect 
and evaluate on the data: AT&T, BBN, CMU, MIT, SRI 
and Paramax (formerly Unisys), it included NIST, which 
was responsible for data validation, distribution and se- 
lection and scoring of test material, and it included the 
Annotation group at SRI, responsible under a separate 
contract for annotating the data with database reference 
answers. 
*This paper was written under the auspices of the Multi- 
Site ATIS Data Collection Working group (MADCOW) by L. 
Hirschman, M. Bates, D. Dahl, W. Fisher, J. Garofolo, K. Hunicke- 
Smith, D. Pallett, C. Pao, P. Price, and A. Rudnicky. In addition, 
many other people made important contributions to this work and 
are listed in the Acknowledgements section. 
The charter of MADCOW was to implement the multi- 
site data collection paradigm, to monitor the distribution 
of the data, and to agree on a test paradigm for the 
multi-site data. The original goals for the data collection 
activity were to collect 10,000 training utterances and 
1,000 test utterances, plus material for a dry-run test 
to be held in October 1991. Between May 1991 and 
February 1992, the following data have been collected 
under the MADCOW effort: 
10,400 training utterances collected from 280 speak- 
ers at 5 sites, with speech and transcriptions dissem- 
inated to testing sites; 
? 5,600 utterances annotated with database reference 
answers, distributed to testing sites; 
? 300 annotated utterances used for October dry-run 
test; 
? 1,000 annotated utterances used for the February 
1992 test; 
? 1,000 utterances set aside for a later test. 
Significant data collection and evaluation infrastructure 
were already in place prior to the formation of MAD- 
COW. This included the definition of the air travel plan- 
ning task \[11\], the database (a relational version of an 
eleven city subset of the Official Airline Guide, contain- 
ing airline, flight and ground transportation i formation, 
initially set up by C. Hemphill at TI and revised and ex- 
tended by It. Moore and others at SRI), a comparator- 
based evaluation methodology for comparing database 
tuples to reference answers \[1, 12\], and several earlier 
ATIS corpora collected at TI  \[2\] and SRI. 
To implement the multi-site data collection effort, each 
site agreed to collect a corpus of 2200 utterances and to 
provide this corpus to NIST in a standard format, includ- 
ing speech data, transcriptions, and a logfile recording 
th e subject's interaction with the data collection system. 
David Pallett's group at NIST was responsible for vali- 
dation and distribution of the training data as well as for 
running the common evaluation. As data were submit- 
ted, NIST checked the data for conformity to the stan- 
dard formats and randomly set aside 20% of each site's 
incoming data for test sets. For the common evaluation, 
NIST was responsible for the release of the test data, and 
the collection, scoring and analysis of the results, as well 
as for adjudication of questions about reference answers 
on the Spoken Language and Natural Language tests. 
The Annotation group under Jared Bernstein at SRI 
was responsible for providing the database reference an- 
swers and for categorization of the data into context- 
independent (class A), context-dependent (class D) and 
unanswerable (class X) utterances. To facilitate timely 
agreement on specific issues, a special subgroup, chaired 
by Deborah Dahl, was formed under MADCOW, with 
responsibility for the Principles of Interpretation 1. 
2. Co l lec t ing  the  Data  
Data collection procedures were not standardized across 
sites. We know that variation in these procedures can 
lead to vast differences in the resulting data. Though 
standardizing is often important and has played a crucial 
role in other areas of the DARPA SLS program, it is also 
difficult and costly. Spoken language understanding asa 
human-computer interface tool is a new technology, and 
the space of potential variations is enormous and largely 
unexplored. We therefore chose to sample various points 
in this space, and to document he differences. This 
decision may be revised as we learn from this experiment. 
We outline in this section those aspects of data collection 
shared by all systems, and provide a separate section for 
each data collection site to highlight the unique aspects 
of that site. 
The original data collected at TI  and SRI used two hu- 
man "wizards." As the subject spoke a sentence, one 
person provided a fast transcription, while the other 
used NLParse 2 to generate an SQL query to access the 
database. At all sites subjects were led to believe they 
are talldng to a fully automated system. For data col- 
lected at SRI, this was true; all other sites used some 
automatic speech recognition and/or natural language 
understanding, with varying amounts of human tran- 
scription and error correction. AT&T used only audio 
outputs; all other sites used a computer screen to display 
tables of data and other information to the subject. The 
two standard microphones were the Sennheiser HMD- 
410 close talking microphone and the Crown PCC-160 
1The Principles of Interpretation are the set of rules governing 
the interpretation f various types of queries, e.g, the meaning of 
"around 10 AM", or the definition of what constitutes a "red-eye 
flight"; see the Principles of Interpretation section below. 
2NLParse is a Texas Instruments propriety system, made avail- 
able to the DARPA research community for the ATIS application

table-top microphone. Table 1 shows the total data col- 
lected by site, including training and test data 3. 
All sites used a set of air travel planning "scenarios" 
(problems) for subjects to solve; BBN supplemented 
these with problems more like general database query 
tasks. The scenarios varied greatly in complexity and in 
the number of queries required for a solution. For sites 
using a wizard, the wizard was constrained in behavior, 
and did not represent human-like capabilities, though 
the wizard's role varied from site to site. By agreement, 
one "common scenario" was designated, shown in Fig- 
ure 1, and sites agreed to collect 10% of their data using 
this common scenario. 
All sites (except BBN) used a debriefing questionnaire 
which explained the nature of the experiment, unveiled 
the deception of the wizard, and elicited comments from 
the subject on the experience. All sites automatically 
generated logfiles documenting subject queries, system 
responses and time stamps for all key events. A sample 
log file is shown in Figure 2; the user input is marked as 
"Utterance", the SQL is marked as "Query", the wizard 
input as "Sentence", the system display as "Result", and 
there are timestamps to mark when speech recording 
begins, when the sentence is sent for processing, and 
when the answer is returned.

subject's queries and answers were stacked on the color 
screen for later examination or other manipulation by 
the subject. The system also used BBN's real-time BY- 
BLOS speech recognition system as the front-end; the 
wizard had the choice of using the speech recognition 
output or correcting it. This choice allowed the wizard 
to give feedback (in terms of errorful speech recognition) 
to the subject hat may have encouraged the subject o 
speak more clearly. Certainly there would be such feed- 
back in a real system. 
The scenarios included not only trip planning scenarios, 
but also problem solving scenarios involving more gen- 
eral kinds of database access, e.g., finding the hub city 
for an airline X. This was done to try to elicit a richer 
range of language use. 
2.2. CMU Data  Co l lec t ion  
The Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) data collection 
system incorporated a working ATIS system \[15\] and a 
wizard. The subject sat at a computer that displayed a
window containing system output, and another window 
that acted as an interface to the "recognition" system 
which used a push-and-hold protocol to record speech. 
Two channels of data were recorded, using both the 
Sennheiser and the Crown microphones. An Ariel DM- 
N digitizer and a Symetrix 202 microphone pre-amplifier 
completed the equipment. The wizard, sitting two cu- 
bicles away in an open-plan lab, listened to the sub- 
ject directly through headphones. A modified version 
of the CMU ATIS system was used to assist the wiz- 
ard in database access. The wizard could paraphrase 
the subject's query or correct recognition errors before 
database access. Retrieved information was previewed 
by the wizard before being sent to the subject's display. 
The wizard also had available a set of standard "error" 
replies to be sent to the subject when appropriate ( .g., 
when the subject asked questions outside the domain). 
Subjects were recruited from the university environment; 
they ranged in age from 18 to 38, with a mean of 24 
years. The subjects were introduced to the system by 
an experimenter who explained the procedure and sat 
with the subject during the first scenario. Standard air 
travel planning scenarios were used. The experimenter 
then left the enclosure, but was available i f  problems 
arose. Subjects completed as many scenarios as fit into 
an hour-long session. A maximum of 6 scenarios were 
available; an average of 4.6 were completed in the data 
collected to date. 
2.3. M IT  Data  Co l lec t ion  
The MIT data collection paradigm emphasized interac- 
tive data collection and dialogue, using the MIT ATIS 
system \[10, 13\]. Data were collected by asking subjects 
to solve scenarios using the system; the experimenter 
sat in another room and transcribed a "clean" version of 
the subject's peech input. The transcriber eliminated 
hesitations, "urns" and false starts, but otherwise sim- 
ply transmitted a transcription ofwhat the subject said. 
The natural anguage component then translated the 
transcribed input into a database query and returned the 
display to the user. The MIT system produced several 
forms of output for the subject, including a summary of 
the question being answered (in both written and spoken 
form) and a reformatted tabular display without cryptic 
abbreviations. The system also supported a capability 
for system-initiated clarification dialogue to handle cases 
where the user underspecified a query. For example, if
the user specified only a destination, the system would 
ask where the subject was departing from. 
Subjects were recruited mainly from MIT and consisted 
of undergraduates, graduate students and employees. 
Each subject was given a $10 gift certificate to a lo- 
cal store. A data collection session lasted approximately 
45 minutes; it included an introduction by the experi- 
menter (who also acted as transcriber); practice with the 
push-and-hold-to-talk mechanism; the solution of three 
or four scenarios (moving from simple scenarios to more 
complex ones involving booking a flight); and completion 
of a debriefing questionnaire. The data were collected in 
an office-noise nvironment using an Ariel Pro-Port A/D 
system connected to a Sun Sparcstation. 
2.4. AT&T Data  Col lect ion 
The AT&T ATIS data were collected using a partially 
simulated, speech-in/speech-out spoken language system 
\[9\]. The natural anguage and database access com- 
ponents of the AT&T system were essentially identi- 
cal to those of the MIT ATIS system \[10\]. The inter- 
face with the the subject was designed to simulate an 
actual telephone-based dialogue: the system provided 
all information in the form of synthesized speech, as 
opposed to displaying information on a computer ter- 
minal. Speech data were captured simultaneously us- 
ing (1) the Sennheiser microphone amplified by a Shure 
FP l l  microphone-to-line amplifier, and (2) a standard 
carbon button-based telephone handset (over local tele- 
phone lines). Digitization was performed by an Ariel 
Pro-Port A/D system. 
Before each recording session, the experimenter provided 
the subject with a brief verbal explanation of the task, 
a page of written instructions, a summary of the ATIS 
database domain, and a list of travel planning scenarios. 
The system initiated the dialogue at the beginning of 
the recording session, and responded after every utter- 
ance with information or with an error message. The 
experimenter controlled recording from the keyboard, 
starting recording as soon as the system response nded, 
and stopping recording when the subject appeared to 
have completed a sentence. The experimenter then tran- 
scribed what the subject said, excluding false starts, and 
sent he transcription tothe system, which automatically 
generated the synthesized response. A complete session 
lasted about an hour, including initial instruction, a two- 
part recording session with a five minute break, and a 
debriefing questionnaire. 
Subjects for data collection were recruited from local 
civic organizations, and collection took place during 
working hours. As a result, 82 percent of the subjects 
were female, and subjects ranged in age from 29 to 77, 
with a median age of 55. In return for each subject's par- 
ticipation, a donation was made to the civic organization 
through which he or she was recruited. 
2.5. SRI  Data  Col lect ion 
The SKI data collection system used SKI's SLS system; 
there was no wizard in the loop. The basic character- 
istics of the DECIPHER speech recognition component 
are described in \[4\], \[6\], and the basic characteristics of 
the natural anguage understanding component are de- 
scribed in \[3\]. Two channels of data were recorded, using 
both the Sennheiser and the Crown microphones. Sub- 
jects clicked a mouse button to talk, and the system de- 
cided when the utterance was complete. The data were 
collected in an office-noise nvironment, using a Sonitech 
Spirit-30 DSP board for A/D connected to a Sun Sparc- 
station. 
Subjects were recruited from other groups at SKI, from 
a nearby university, and from a volunteer organization. 
They were given a brief overview of the system and its 
capabilities, and were then asked to solve one or sev- 
eral air travel planning scenarios. The interface allowed 
the user to move to the context of a previous question. 
Some subjects used the real-time hardware version of 
the DECIPHER system \[5\], \[16\]; others used the soft- 
ware version of the system. Other parameters that were 
varied included: instructions to subjects regarding what 
they should do when the system made errors, the inter- 
face to the context-setting mechanism, and the number 
of scenarios and sessions. See \[14\] for details on the in- 
terface and the conditions that were varied from subject 
to subject. 
3. D is t r ibut ing  the  Data  
During the MADCOW collection effort, NIST was pri- 
marily responsible for two steps in the data pipeline: (1) 
quality control and distribution of "initial" unannotated 
data received from the collection sites; and (2) quality 
control and distribution of annotated data from the SRI 
annotators. 
3.1. D is t r ibut ion  o f  In i t ia l  Data  
Initial (unannotated) ata were received on 8ram tar-  
formatted tapes from the collection sites, logged into 
the file "madcow-tapes.log", and placed in queue for dis- 
tribution. The initial data consisted of a .log file for 
each subject-scenario, and .way (NIST-headered speech 
waveform with standard header fields) and .sro (speech 
recognition detailed transcription) files for each utter- 
ance. The 8ram tapes were downloaded and the initial 
data and filename/directory structure were verified for 
format compliance using a suite of shell program verifi- 
10 
cation programs. Non-compliant data were either fixed 
at NIST or returned to the site for correction, depending 
on the degree and number of problems. Twenty percent 
of the utterances from each collection site was then set 
aside as potential test data. The remaining data for 
training were assigned an initial release ID (date) and 
the textual non-waveform data were then made avail- 
able to the collection and annotation sites via anony- 
mous ftp. The tape log file, "madcow-tapes.log" was 
updated with the release date. A cumulative l xicon in 
the file "lexicon.doc.<DATE>" was also updated with 
each new release. During the peak of data collection ac- 
tivity, these releases occurred at weekly intervals. When 
enough waveforms (.way) had accumulated to fill a CD- 
ROM (630 Mb), the waveforms were premastered onan 
IS0-9660 8ram tape which was then sent to MIT for 
"one-off" (recordable) CD-ROM production. Upon re- 
ceipt of each CD-ROM from MIT, the initial release 
ID(s) of the data~on the CD-ROM were recorded in 
the file "madcow-waves.log", and the CD-ROMs were 
shipped overnight to the MADCOW sites. 
3.2. D is t r ibut ion  o f  Annotated  Data  
Annotated ata from SRI were downloaded at NIST via 
ftp. The data were organized by initial release date in the 
standard ATIS file and directory structure and contained 
files for the query categorization (.cat), wizard input to 
NLParse (.win) a, the SQL for the minimal answer (.sql), 
the SQL for the maximal answer (.sq2, generated from 
the minimal SQL) and the corresponding minimal and 
maximal reference answers (.ref, .rf2). 
The .cat, .ref, and .rf2 files in the release were verified for 
format compliance using a suite of verification programs. 
A classification summary was then generated for the re- 
lease and the data made available to the MADCOW sites 
via anonymous ftp. The "madcow-answers.log" file was 
updated with the release date. 
3.3. Data  D is t r ibut ion  Summary  
Table 2 shows a summary by site and class of the an- 
notated MADCOW data distributed by NIST as of De- 
cember 20, 1991. 
3.4. Common Documentat ion  
To facilitate common data exchange, MADCOW devel- 
oped a set of documents which specify the formats for 
each common file type, listed below:

dard header fields

In addition, documentation was developed to specify di- 
rectory and filename structures, as well as file contents. 
To insure conformity, NIST created and distributed for- 
mat verification software for each file type and for direc- 
tory/filename structures. The specifications documents 
and verification software are maintained for public dis- 
tribution in NIST's anonymous ftp directory. NIST also 
maintains documentation for the transcription conven- 
tions, logfile formats, categorization principles and prin- 
ciples of database interpretation, also available in NIST's 
anonymous ftp directory. 
To track the flow of data through the distribution 
"pipeline" during data collection, NIST maintained and 
published the data flow logs and documentation modifi- 
cations in weekly electronic mail reports to MADCOW. 
4. The  Eva luat ion  Parad igm 
The diversity of data collection paradigms was a con- 
cern for MADCOW. To control for potential effects in- 
troduced by this diversity, it was agreed that test sets 
would consist of comparable amounts of data from each 
site (regardless of the amount of training material avail- 
able from that site). In addition, benchmark test results 
would be displayed in an N * M matrix form (for the N 
systems under test from the M data collecting sites). For 
the February 1992 tests, the number of collecting sites 
(M) was 5. This format was intended to indicate if data 
from one collecting site were "outliers" and whether a 
site performed particularly well on locally collected ata. 
The February 1992 Evaluation required sites to gener- 
ate answers for data presented in units consisting of a 
"subject-scenario'. The utterances from the scenario 
11 
were presented in sequence, with no annotation as to 
the class of the utterances. For scoring purposes, as in 
previous ATIS Benchmark tests \[7\], test queries were 
grouped into several classes on the basis of annotations. 
Results for the context-independent sentences (Class A) 
and context-dependent sentences (class D) were com- 
puted and tabulated separately, along with an overall 
score (A + D). Class X queries ("unanswerable" queries) 
were not included in the NL or SLS tests, but were in- 
cluded in the SPREC tests (since valid .lsn transcriptions 
existed for these utterances). The matrix tabulations re- 
ported on % correct, % incorrect and % weighted error 5 
defined as \[2 ? (%Fa lse)  + (%No_Answer) \ ] .  
The February 1992 results also reflected a new method 
of computing answer "correctness" using both a mini- 
real and a maximal database reference answer. The ob- 
jective was to guard against "overgeneration": getting 
answers correct by including all possible facts about a 
given flight or fare, rather than by understanding what 
specific information was requested. This method (pro- 
posed by R. Moore and implemented by Moore and E. 
Jackson of SRI) specified the maximum relevant informa- 
tion for any query, and required that the correct answer 
contain at least the minimal correct information, and no 
more than the maximum. This method was first used 
during the October 1991 "dry run" and was adopted as 
the standard scoring procedure by the DARPA Spoken 
Language Coordinating Committee. 
Three types of performance assessment tests were com- 
puted on the ATIS MADCOW Benchmark Test Data: 
SPeech RECognition (SPREC), Natural Language (NL), 
and Spoken Language Systems (SLS) tests. Details of 
these tests, and a summary of "official" reported results, 
are to be found elsewhere in these Proceedings \[8\]. 
5. Annotat ion  
The goal of annotation was to classify utterances and 
provide database reference answers for the subjects' 
queries in the ATIS domain. These reference answers 
were used by the system developers and by NIST to eval- 
uate the responses of the MADCOW natural language 
and spoken language systems. 
The annotators began with the transcribed .sro files, and 
determined the possible interpretations of each utter- 
ance, classifying them as one of the following: 
? A: context-independent 
? D: context-dependent (classification includes tag(s) 
pointing to the context-setting query or queries). 
5This single number performance measure was first introduced 
for the February 1991 tests.

input) that could be interpreted by NLParse, a menu- 
driven program that converts English-like sentences into 
database queries expressed in SQL. Annotation deci- 
sions about how to translate the .sros were guided by 
the "Principles of Interpretation" (see the next section). 
After the .sro form of an utterance was classified and 
translated, the work was checked thoroughly by another 
annotator and by various checking programs. NLParse 
was then run to generate an SQL form in a .sql file. Fi- 
nally a series of batch programs was run on each .sql file 
to produce the minimal and maximal reference answers 
(.ref and .rf2 files) for the corresponding utterance. 
Figure 3 shows the annotation files created for a sam- 
ple ATIS dialogue. Each line in italics identifies the file; 
the .sro file is the input; the .cat, .win, .ref and .rf2 files 
are created during the annotation procedure. Sentence 
#1 is class A, and has as its minimal reference answer 
the set of flight IDs for flights meeting the constraints. 
The maximal answer contains all of the columns used in 
the .sql query to constrain the answer; the answer is too 
12 
large to be displayed here. The .sro for sentence #2 ends 
with a truncation (marked by a tilde ~ ), which causes 
it to be classified as X (unevaluable). Thus no .win, .ref 
or .rf2 files are generated. Sentence #3 is a context- 
dependent utterance, due to the anaphoric expression 
that flight. It depends on #2, but since #2 is class X, 
#3 is also classified as X, following the principle that 
anything that depends on a class X (unevaiuable) sen- 
tence must itself be unevaluable. Finally, sentence #4 
is a yes-no question, which may have two answers: ei- 
ther YES or the set of entities atisfying the constraints. 
This sentence is also context-dependent, since it refers to 
flight US 732 between Pittsburgh and Boston. (Flight 
732 may go to other cities, thus context is needed to es- 
tablish the segment of interest). The minimal reference 
answer to the question about meals is defined to be the 
triple (meal,number,class). The maximal answer can in- 
clude any information used in the .sql to generate the 
minimal answer. 
6. Principles of Interpretation 
In order to carry out an objective valuation, it was nec- 
essary to be able to say whether an answer was right or 
wrong. In turn, deciding on the right answer often de- 
pended on how particular words and constructions in the 
query were interpreted. Thus, it was recognized early on 
in the development of the ATIS common task that it 
would be necessary to agree on specific definitions for 
certain vague expressions. In addition, given the cur- 
rent database, there was often more than one reason- 
able way of relating particular queries to the database. 
To insure objectivity in the evaluation, decisions about 
how to interpret queries had to be documented in such 
a way that all participants in the evaluation had access 
to them. The Principles of Interpretation document de- 
scribes the interpretation of queries with respect o the 
ATIS database. This document was used both by system 
developers to train their systems and by the annotators 
for developing reference answers. 
Examples of decisions in the Principles of Interpretation 
include: the meaning of terms like early morning, classi- 
fication of a snack as a meal for the purposes of answering 
questions about meals, and the meaning of constructions 
such as between X and Y, defined for ATIS to mean "from 
X to Y". 
A subgroup on the Principles of Interpretation was 
formed to discuss and make decisions on new issues of 
interpretation as they arose data collection and anno- 
tation. A representative from each site served on this 
subgroup. This insured that all sites were notified when 
changes or additions occurred in the Principles, and al- 
lowed each site to have input into the decision process. 
It was important o make careful decisions, because any 
revision could cause previously annotated ata to be- 
come inconsistent with the revised Principles of Inter- 
pretation. On the other hand, in many cases there was 
no one "correct" way of interpreting something, for ex- 
ample, the classification of a snack as a meal. In cases 
like this, the main goal was to make sure that all partic- 
ipants understood the chosen interpretation. 
It Was agreed that reference answers should emphasize 
literal understanding of an utterance, rather than a co- 
operative answer which might cause more information 
to be included than what was actually requested. How- 
ever, to support systems used for demonstrations and for 
data collection as well as for evaluation, answers needed 
to be minimally cooperative, since otherwise demonstra- 
tion systems would have to answer differently from eval- 
uation systems. Thus the main criterion was how well 
the proposed interpretation reflected understanding of 
the query, with some consideration for providing a coop- 
erative answer. 
7. Conclusion 
The MADC0W experiment in multi-site data collection 
and evaluation has been successful. The participating 
sites have collected a rich corpus of training data, have 
put in place methods for distributing the data, and have 
devised test procedures to evaluate speech, natural an- 
guage, and spoken language results on a test corpus. The 
resources made available by the multi-site paradigm have 
allowed us to collect more data and to learn more about 
data collection than would have been possible with only 
one or two sites collecting data under a special contract. 
Some difficult problems till remain. Our shared goal is 
to build interactive spoken language systems; however, 
our evaluation methods rely on a canned corpus and 
evaluate a system's recognition performance under static 
conditions that are not representative of the interactive 
environments in which these systems will eventually be 
used. In addition, the ATIS task has been limited so far 
to a small, static subset of the air travel domain. These 
difficulties will increase as research sites develop differ- 
ent approaches to actively managing interaction with the 
user: different processing strategies will generate diver- 
gent behaviors on the part of users, but this divergence 
will lessen the validity of tests that assume comparable 
responses to a sequence of queries. 
The MADCOW collection and evaluation procedures 
have provided effective tools for assessing the current ca- 
pabilities of interactive spoken language systems. How- 
ever, we must continue to improve our methods of 
data collection and evaluation. For example, we have 
13 
only just begun to explore the use of real-time spo- 
ken language systems for data collection and evaluation. 
We also need to more towards a larger, more realis- 
tic, database. As our spoken language systems evolve, 
data collection and evaluation methods must evolve with 
them.
