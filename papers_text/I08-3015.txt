Abstract 
 
A good POS tagger is a critical component 
of a machine translation system and other 
related NLP applications where an 
appropriate POS tag will be assigned to 
individual words in a collection of texts. 
There is not enough POS tagged corpus 
available in Manipuri language ruling out 
machine learning approaches for a POS 
tagger in the language. A morphology 
driven Manipuri POS tagger that uses three 
dictionaries containing root words, prefixes 
and suffixes has been designed and 
implemented using the affix information 
irrespective of the context of the words. We 
have tested the current POS tagger on 3784 
sentences containing 10917 unique words. 
The POS tagger demonstrated an accuracy 
of 69%. Among the incorrectly tagged 31% 
words, 23% were unknown words (includes 
9% named entities) and 8% known words 
were wrongly tagged.  
 
1 Introduction 
 
Manipuri (Meiteilon or Meiteiron) belongs to the 
Tibeto-Burman language family and is highly 
agglutinative in behavior, monosyllabic, influenced 
and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of 
Sanskrit origin and English. The affixes play the 
most important role in the structure of the language. 
A clear -cut demarcation between morphology and 
syntax is not possible. In Manipuri, words are formed 
in three processes called affixation, derivation and 
compounding (Thoudam, 2006). The majority of the 
roots found in the language are bound and the affixes 
are the determining factor of the class of the words in 
the language. Classification of words using the role 
of affix helps to implement the tagger for a resource 
poor language like Manipuri with high performance.  
There are many POS taggers developed using 
different techniques for many major languages such 
as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 
1995), decision trees (Black et al, 1992), Markov 
model (Cutting et al, 1992), maximum entropy 
methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English. 
Decision trees are used to estimate marginal 
probabilities in a maximum entropy model for 
predicting the parts-of-speech of a word given the 
context in which it appears (Black et al, 1992). The 
rules in a rule-based system are usually difficult to 
construct and typically are not very robust (Brill, 
1992). Large tables of statistics are not needed for the 
rule-based tagger. In a stochastic tagger, tens of 
thousands of lines of statistical information are 
needed to capture the contextual information (Brill, 
1992). For a tagger to function as a practical 
component in a language processing system, a tagger 
must be robust, efficient, accurate, tunable and 
reusable (Cutting, 1992).  
 
2 Previous work on Manipuri POS tagger 
 
Morphology based POS tagging of some languages 
like Turkish (Oflazer and Kuruoz, 1994), Czech 
(Hajic, et al, 2001) has been tried out using a 
combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical 
learning. A Marathi rule based POS tagger used a 
technique called SRR (suffix replacement rule) 
(Burange et al, 2006) with considerable accuracy. A 
POS tagger for Hindi overcomes the handicap of 
annotated corpora scarcity by exploiting the rich 
morphology of the language (Singh et al, 2006). To 
the best of our knowledge, there is no record 
available of work done on a Manipuri POS tagger. A 
related work of word class and sentence type 
identification in a Manipuri Morphological Analyzer 
91
is found in (Thoudam and Bandyopadhyay, 2006) 
where the classification of few word categories and 
sentence type identification are discussed based on 
affix rules.  
 
3 Manipuri Morphemes 
 
There are free and bound roots in Manipuri. All the 
verb roots are bound roots. There are also a few 
bound noun roots, the interrogative and 
demonstrative pronoun roots. They cannot occur 
without some particle prefixed or suffixed to it. The 
bound root may form a compound by the addition of 
another root. The free roots are pure nouns, 
pronouns, time adverbials and some numerals. The 
bound roots are mostly verb roots although there are 
a few noun and other roots. The suffixes, which are 
attached to the nouns, derived nouns, to the 
adjectives in noun phrases including numerals, the 
case markers and the bound coordinators are the 
nominal suffixes. In Manipuri, the nominal suffixes 
are always attached to the numeral in a noun phrase 
and the noun cannot take the suffixes. Since 
numerals are considered as adjectives, the position 
occupied by the numerals in Manipuri may be 
regarded adjective position (Thoudam, 2006). There 
are a few prefixes in Manipuri. These prefixes are 
mostly attached to the verb roots. They can also be 
attached to the derived nouns and bound noun roots. 
There are also a few prefixes derived from the 
personal pronouns.  
In this agglutinative language the numbers of 
verbal suffixes are more than that of the nominal 
suffixes (Singh, 2000). New words are easily formed 
in Manipuri using morphological rules. Inflectional 
morphology is more productive than derivative 
morphology (Chelliah, 1997). There are 8 
inflectional (INFL) suffixes and 23 enclitics (ENC). 
There are 5 derivational prefixes out of which 2 are 
category changing and 3 are non-category changing. 
There are 31 non-category changing derivational 
suffixes and 2 category changing suffixes. The non-
category changing derivational suffixes may be 
divided into first level derivatives (1st LD) of 8 
suffixes, second level derivatives (2nd LD) of 16 
suffixes and third level derivatives (3rd LD) of 7 
suffixes.  Enclitics in Manipuri fall in six categories: 
determiners, case markers, the copula, mood 
markers, inclusive/exclusive and pragmatic peak 
markers and attitude markers. The categories are 
determined on the basis of position in the word 
(category 1 occurs before category 2, category 2 
occurs before category 3 and so on). 
 
4 Dictionaries  
 
Three different dictionaries namely prefix which 
contains prefix information, suffix which contains 
suffix information and root containing 2051 entries 
are used for the system. The format of root is 
<root><category>. 
A bilingual dictionary consisting of Manipuri 
word and its corresponding pronunciation, POS, 1st 
English (Eng1) word meaning, 2nd English (Eng2) 
word meaning (if any), 3rd English (Eng3) word 
meaning (if any), a Manipuri sentence or phrase 
using the word and corresponding English meaning 
has been developed based on the work of Manipuri to 
English Dictionary (Imoba, 2004). The bilingual 
parallel dictionary is used for testing POS tagger and 
later on will be used for EBMT system. The 
Manipuri sentences/phrases using a particular word 
are used as the input to the POS tagger thus enabling 
to sort out words with multiple meaning.   
 
5 Morphological analysis of Major Lexical 
categories  
 
The lexical categories in Manipuri can be of two 
types ? major and minor (Chelliah, 1997). Major 
lexical categories can be of two types, namely 
?actual? and ?potential?. The lexicon of actual lexical 
categories i.e., actual lexicon consists of an 
unordered list of roots and affixes and lexicalized 
forms. Each lexical entry in the actual lexicon 
consists of what lexical category it belongs to and 
what its meaning is. On the other hand, the output of 
the potential lexicon consists of words created 
through productive morphological processes. In the 
actual lexicon, roots may be bound or free. Nouns 
and verbs from the actual lexicon can be 
distinguished on formal grounds in that bound roots 
are verbs and free roots are nouns. In the potential 
lexicon, adjectives, adverbs and nominal forms can 
be derived from verb roots and stative verbs can be 
derived from noun roots. There are several instances 
where the words belonging to some class or category 
plays the role of some other category sometimes 
based on its position in the sentences (P.C. Thoudam, 
92
2006) Some of the generalized handcrafted rules to 
identify the lexical are given as below.  
 
5.1 Nouns 
 
Nouns can be distinguished from other lexical 
categories on morphological grounds. Unlike verbs, 
nouns can be suffixed by gender, number or case 
markers. Proper nouns and common nouns are free 
standing forms.  
The following is the list of word structure rules 
for nouns (Chelliah, 1997) 
N ? Root INFL (ENC) 
Root ? Root (2nd LD) 
Root ? Root (1st LD) 
Root ? (prefix) root (root) 
Figure 1 shows the general form of noun 
morphology in Manipuri. Examples of some 
singular/plural noun forms are listed in Table 1.

Figure 1. General form of Noun Morphology 
 
Singular Form Plural Form 
=??J?E?  -Uchek (bird) =??J?E??`e -Ucheksing(birds) 
]   -Ma (He/She) ]?F??^  -Makhoy (they) 
]?  -Mi (man) ]??^?] -Mi-yaam (men) 
Table 1: Singular/Plural forms 
 
Although case markers are functionally 
inflectional, they exhibit the clitic like characteristic 
of docking at the edge of a phrase. The word 
structure of rules of verbs and nouns are identical 
except for the category of the word level node, the 
possible terminal elements of the derivational and 
inflectional categories and the lack of the third level 
nominal derivation. Two examples to demonstrate 
the noun morphology are given below:- 
]J??X?Y??`eX? (m?-ca-nu-pi-si?-n?) ?by his/her 
daughters? 
]J??X?Y??`eX? (m?-ca-nu-pa-si?- n?) ?by his/her sons? 
 
The ] -m? ?his/her? is the pronominal suffix and J?? -ca 
?child? is the noun root. The X? -nu ?human? is suffixed 
by Y? -pi to indicate a female human and Y??pa to 
indicate a male human. ?`e ?si? or ?F?+ -khoy or ?^?]?
yaam can be used to indicate plurality. -si? cannot be 
used with pronouns or proper nouns and -khoy 
cannot be used with nonhuman nouns. X? -n? meaning 
?by the? is the instrumental case marker.  
 
5.2 Pronouns 
 
The singular personal pronouns are B -?y ?I?, Xe -n?? 
?you? and ]? -ma ?he/she?. Possessive pronouns are 
formed through the suffixation of ?E? -ki ?genitive? on 
these personal pronouns.  Indefinite pronouns are 
also lexicalized forms that consists of a question 
word which may be followed by a? -su ?also? or the 
sequence E????? -kumb? composed of E??] ?kum, ?like?, 
?kind of? and [? ?b? ?nominalizer?. The strategy for 
creating relative clause in Manipuri is to place the 
relativized noun directly after a normalized clause; 
there is no relative pronoun to mark the relative 
clause. The determiner may occur either as an 
independent pronoun or encliticized on the noun 
phrase with no difference in meaning. The 
determiners ?a ?si ?proximate? and T?  ?tu ?distal? are 
stems that function as enclitics. ?a ?si indicated that 
the object or person being spoken of is near or 
currently seen or known to be near., even if not 
viewable by the speaker, or is currently the topic of 
conversation; T? ?-tu signifies something or someone 
not present at the time of speech or newly introduced 
in the conversation. Possessive pronominal prefix 
may be affixed to the root `? sa ?body? to form 
pronouns emphasizing that the subject of the verb is 
a particular person or thing and no one or nothing 
else: +`?X? isan? ?by myself? X`?X? n?san? ?by 
yourself? and ]`?X? m?san? ?by him/her/itself/.  The 
set of Manipuri Pronominal prefixes differ for 
different persons (+  {I} for 1st person, X {Na} for 2nd 
person and ]  {Ma} for 3rd person) while the set of 
pronominal suffixes differ only on gender (Y? ?pa for 
masculine gender,  Y? -Pi for feminine gender). 
 
5.3 Verbs 
 
Verbs roots are in the actual lexicon and are bound 
forms. A verb may be free standing word if it is 
minimally suffixed by an inflectional marker. The 
verb root may also be followed by one of the 
enclitics. Three derivational categories may 
optionally precede the final inflectional suffix. The 
1st LD suffixes signal adverbial meanings, the 2nd LD 
suffixes indicate evidentiality, the deitic reference of 
93
a verb, or the number of persons performing the 
action and the 3rd LD suffixes signal aspect and 
mood. Verb roots may also be used to form verbal 
nouns, adjectives and adverbs. Verbal nouns are 
formed through the suffixation of the nominalizer Y? 
?p? to the verb root. 
The following is the list of word structure rules 
for verbs (Chelliah, 1997) 
 
a. Verb ? Root INFL 
b. Root ? Root (3rd LD) 
c. Root ? Root (2nd LD) 
d. Root ? Root (1st LD) 
e. Root ? root (root) 
f. 3rd LD ? (mood1)(mood2)(aspect) 
g. 2nd LD ? (2nd LD1),(2nd LD2),(2nd LD3)..

Figure 2. General form of Verb Morphology 
 
There are 3 categories (mood1, mood2, and 
aspect) belonging to the third level derivational (3rd 
LD) markers. The general form of verb morphology 
is shown in figure 2. 
The sub-categorization frames of affixes will 
restrict that only nominal affixes occur with a noun 
and verbal affixes occur with a verb root. The 
derivational suffix order of the word ??J?E?F?+?[?h??X is 
given below:- 
 
??J?E?         F?+?            ?[?E?        E            ?X 
cek        ?khay                -r?k          -k?              -ni 
crack   -totally affect    -distal      -potential   ?copula 
 (1st LD)          (2nd LD)     (3rd LD)  
The ?[?E? -r?k  has allomorph _E?-l?k.  ?[?E? -r?k occurs 
after vowels while _E?-l?k occurs after consonants. 
Such allomorph is an example of orthographic 
change and it is taken care by the system by making 
individual entries into the dictionary.  
 
?J???[?E?A ?ca-r?k-y (ate there and came here)  
?J?????E?A ? cam-l?k-y (washed there and came here) 
 
The formation of verb can be of the form 
 
Verb stem + aspect/mood ? verb 
UE? -th?k (drink)  + ?_ -le- ? UE??_ th?kle (has drunk) 
 
The verbal noun is formed with the rule as given as 
 
Verb Stem + Nominalizer ? Verbal noun 
?U?e -thong (cook)+ [?? -ba  ? ?U?e[??? thongba  (to cook) 
  
5.4 Adjectives 
 
An adjective is derived through the affixation of the 
attributive, derivational prefix % ?- to a verbal noun.  
e.g. 
% -? + Verbal noun ? Adjective 
% -? + ?a -si (die) + [?? -ba?>%?a[?? ?siba (something 
dead) 
Adjectives may appear before or after the nouns 
they modify.  Possessive adjectives are formed 
through the suffixation of the genitive marker ?E? ?ki 
to the possessor of a noun.  
 
5.5 Adverbs 
 
Manner adverbs are formed through suffixation of X? 
?n? ?adverbial? to a verb root. e.g. ?_??^X?  loyn? 
?completely, all? from loy ?complete,finish?. e.g.,  
 
Stem  +   X? - na   ? Adverb 
E?Y -K?p (cry)+ X? - na  ?> E?YX? -k?p-na (cryingly) 
 
Locative adverbs are derived through the 
prefixation of ] m? ?noun marker? to a noun or verb 
roots. e.g. ]F? m?kha ?below, underneath? from  F?  
kha ?south? 
 
 
6 Morphological analyses of some minor 
lexical categories 
 
The three minor lexical categories of Manipuri are 
quantifiers, numerals and interjections. These are 
considered minor categories because these lexical 
items are closed sets which express meanings most 
often encoded by affixal morphology. The lexical 
items in interjection is defined on the semantic 
similarity of its members, all express strong emotion.  
 
 
 
 
94
6.1 Quantifiers 
 
Most quantifiers in Manipuri are lexicalized forms 
consisting of the unproductive prefix khV- (where the 
vowel can be a, i, u). These are F?[?? -kh?ra ?some? 
which indicates an indeterminate amount; ?FTe -
khit?? ?ever so little, a particle? of some tangible 
material. These quantifiers can be combined as in  
 
<?`e   F?[??     ?FT?e     Y??[?E?=. 
Ishi?   kh?ra    khit?? pur?k-u 
 ?Bring me just a little bit of water?. 
 
6.2 Numerals 
 
The numerals are nouns. Ordinal numerals are 
adjectives, derived through the affixation of the 
attributive prefix % ?? and the nominalizer [?? ?b? to 
any numeral with ? ?su ?also?: thus %?X?[?? ?nisub? 
?second one?. 
 
6.3 Interjections 
 
The lexical items of this category which is defined on 
the semantic similarity of its members, all express 
strong emotion. Some of these are composite forms 
where one syllable is identifiable as the exasperative 
enclitic ?c? ?he and the second syllable is not 
identifiable as a productive affix or stem. 
 
7 Manipuri Tagset  
 
The basic Manipuri POS tag set used in the POS 
tagger is listed below. E??y?? E??y?? kukru kukru (a 
pigeon?s cry) is ideophone. T?? tu ?that? is a 
determiner. c???^[??` haybasi is a determiner 
complementizer.

The different parts involved in the system are:- 
a. Tokenizer: Words are separated based on 
the space given between consecutive words. 
b. Stemmer: It separates the prefixes and 
suffixes from the words. 
c. Engine: Different analysis and treatment of 
different words are performed based on the 
category. 
d. Tag Generator: Tags are assigned to the 
words in the sentence input based on the 
tagset and morphology rules. 
e. Dictionaries:  Prefix, suffix and word 
dictionary along with sentences using the 
words are maintained.

8.1 Algorithm of POS tagging 
 
Algorithm used for tagging is as follows:- 
 
1. Input the Manipuri input texts to the 
Tokenizer. 
2. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until the end of the texts 
for each token. 
3. Feed the tokens to the stemmer. 
4. Check the patterns and order of the different 
morphemes by looking at the stem category. 
5. Apply the handcrafted morphological rules 
for identifying the category using the engine. 
6. Generate the POS tags using Tag generator. 
7. End. 
The Visual C++, MsAccess and GIST SDK are 
used to develop the system. The Manipuri words are 
entered into the dictionary using Bengali script (BN1 
TTBidisha font).  
 
9 Evaluation 
 
In Manipuri, word category is not so distinct except 
Noun. The verbs are also under bound category. 
Another problem is to classify basic root forms 
according to word class although the distinction 
between the noun class and verb classes is relatively 
clear, the distinction between nouns and adjectives is 
often vague. Distinction between a noun and an 
adverb becomes unclear because structurally a word 
may be a noun but contextually it is adverb. Thus, 
the assumption made for word categories are 
depending upon the root category and affix 
information available from the dictionaries. At the 
moment, we use a sequential search of a stem from 
the root dictionary in alphabetical order. It is found 
to be suitable for small size dictionary. Further a part 
of root may also be a prefix which leads to wrong 
tagging. The verb morphology is more complex than 
that of noun. A comparative study on the number of 
words tagged by the system and manually tagged had 
been carried out. The inputs of 3784 Manipuri 
sentences of 10917 unique words as input to the 
tagger engine. Sometimes two words get fused to 
form a complete word. Handling such collocations is 
difficult. Conjuncts require a separate dealing using a 
table. Verbs, nouns and noun phrases, subordinate 
sentences, and root sentences can be affixed by 
enclitics. Table 4 shows the percentage statistics of 
tagging output based on the actual and correctly 
tagged words. The accuracy of tagging can be further 
improved by populating more root morphemes to the 
root dictionary.

Table 4. Tagger output statistics 
 
The unknown words are the words which could not 
be tagged based on the linguistic rules and 
unavailability of entries mainly in root dictionary. In 
the process of word formation, only affixation: 
prefixing, suffixing or compounding takes the role of 
formation of new words in this language. Due to the 
fact that new words are easily formed in Manipuri, 
thus the number of unknown words (out of 
vocabulary) is relatively large (Sirajul et al, 2004). 
  
10 Challenges for future work 
 
The noun group words handling are not incorporated. 
For example %F?E? %?[??C (pronounced as ?khak ?raw) 
meaning thunderbolt, %I?] %?[??+ FI?V[?? (pronounced as 
??am ?ray kh??d?ba) meaning wanton are noun 
group words and are not tagged by the POS tagger 
correctly. The Noun-Adjective ambiguity 
disambiguation scheme is required as a separate 
module and implementations are to be included in the 
future work. The Manipuri tagging is very much 
dependent on the morphological analysis and lexical 
rules of each category. There is a cleaning process of 
all word and morphemes specially the spelling to 
ensure that the lexical rules are implemented. This 
has not yet been implemented. Collocations handling 
and more disambiguation rules will be developed in 
further phases of the work. The output of the POS 
tagger will be used in a Manipuri-English machine 
translation system.
