Abstract
N-gram-based models co-exist with their
phrase-based counterparts as an alternative
SMT framework. Both techniques have pros
and cons. While the N-gram-based frame-
work provides a better model that captures
both source and target contexts and avoids
spurious phrasal segmentation, the ability to
memorize and produce larger translation units
gives an edge to the phrase-based systems dur-
ing decoding, in terms of better search per-
formance and superior selection of transla-
tion units. In this paper we combine N-gram-
based modeling with phrase-based decoding,
and obtain the benefits of both approaches.
Our experiments show that using this combi-
nation not only improves the search accuracy
of the N-gram model but that it also improves
the BLEU scores. Our system outperforms
state-of-the-art phrase-based systems (Moses
and Phrasal) and N-gram-based systems by
a significant margin on German, French and
Spanish to English translation tasks.
1 Introduction
Statistical Machine Translation advanced from
word-based models (Brown et al, 1993) towards
more sophisticated models that take contextual in-
formation into account. Phrase-based (Och and
Ney, 2004; Koehn et al, 2003) and N-gram-based
(Marin?o et al, 2006) models are two instances of
such frameworks. While the two models have some
common properties, they are substantially different.
?Much of the work presented here was carried out while the
first author was at the University of Stuttgart.
Phrase-based systems employ a simple and effec-
tive machinery by learning larger chunks of trans-
lation called phrases1. Memorizing larger units en-
ables the phrase-based model to learn local depen-
dencies such as short reorderings, idioms, insertions
and deletions, etc. The model however, has the fol-
lowing drawbacks: i) it makes independence as-
sumptions over phrases ignoring the contextual in-
formation outside of phrases ii) it has issues han-
dling long-distance reordering iii) it has the spurious
phrasal segmentation problem which allows multi-
ple derivations of a bilingual sentence pair having
different model scores for each segmentation.
Modeling with minimal translation units helps ad-
dress some of these issues. The N-gram-based SMT
framework is based on tuples. Tuples are mini-
mal translation units composed of source and target
cepts2. N-gram-based models are Markov models
over sequences of tuples (Marin?o et al, 2006; Crego
and Marin?o, 2006) or operations encapsulating tu-
ples (Durrani et al, 2011). This mechanism has sev-
eral useful properties. Firstly, no phrasal indepen-
dence assumption is made. The model has access
to both source and target context outside of phrases.
Secondly the model learns a unique derivation of a
bilingual sentence given its alignment, thus avoiding
the spurious segmentation problem.
Using minimal translation units, however, results
in a higher number of search errors because of i)
1A phrase-pair in PBSMT is a sequence of source and target
words that is translation of each other, and is not necessarily a
linguistic constituent. Phrases are built by combining minimal
translation units and ordering information.
2A cept is a group of words in one language that is translated
as a minimal unit in one specific context (Brown et al, 1993).

poor translation selection, ii) inaccurate future-cost
estimates and iii) incorrect early pruning of hypothe-
ses that would produce better model scores if al-
lowed to continue. In order to deal with these
problems, search is carried out only on a graph
of pre-calculated orderings, and ad-hoc reordering
limits are imposed to constrain the search space
(Crego et al, 2005; Crego and Marin?o, 2006), or
a higher beam size is used in decoding (Durrani
et al, 2011). The ability to memorize and pro-
duce larger translation chunks during decoding, on
the other hand, gives a distinct advantage to the
phrase-based system during search. Phrase-based
systems i) have access to uncommon translations,
ii) do not require higher beam sizes, iii) have more
accurate future-cost estimates because of the avail-
ability of phrase-internal language model context
before search is started. To illustrate this consider
the German-English phrase-pair ?scho? ein Tor ?
scored a goal?, composed from the tuples (cept-
pairs) ?scho? ? scored?, ?ein ? a? and ?Tor ? goal?.
It is likely that the N-gram system does not have
the tuple ?scho? ? scored? in its n-best translation
options because ?scored? is an uncommon transla-
tion for ?scho?? outside the sports domain. Even if
?scho? ? scored? is hypothesized, it will be ranked
quite low in the stack until ?ein? and ?Tor? are gen-
erated in the next steps. A higher beam is required
to prevent it from getting pruned. Phrase-based sys-
tems, on the other hand, are likely to have access to
the phrasal unit ?scho? ein Tor ? scored a goal? and
can generate it in a single step. Moreover, a more ac-
curate future-cost estimate can be computed because
of the available context internal to the phrase.
In this work, we extend the N-gram model, based
on operation sequences (Durrani et al, 2011), to
use phrases during decoding. The main idea is to
study whether a combination of modeling with min-
imal translation units and using phrasal information
during decoding helps to solve the above-mentioned
problems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. The next two sections review phrase-based
and N-gram-based SMT. Section 2 provides a com-
parison of phrase-based and N-gram-based SMT.
Section 3 summarizes the operation sequence model
(OSM), the main baseline for this work. Section

tence Pair
minimal units. Section 5 discusses how information
available in phrases can be used to improve search
performance. Section 6 presents the results of this
work. We conducted experiments on the German-to-
English and French-to-English translation tasks and
found that using phrases in decoding improves both
search accuracy and BLEU scores. Finally we com-
pare our system with two state-of-the-art phrase-
based systems (Moses and Phrasal) and two state-
of-the-art N-gram-based systems (Ncode and OSM)
on standard translation tasks.
2 Previous Work
Phrase-based and N-gram-based SMT are alter-
native frameworks for string-to-string translation.
Phrase-based SMT segments a bilingual sentence
pair into phrases that are continuous sequences of
words (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al, 2003)
or discontinuous sequences of words (Galley and
Manning, 2010). These phrases are then reordered
through a lexicalized reordering model that takes
into account the orientation of a phrase with respect
to its previous phrase (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005)
or block of phrases (Galley and Manning, 2008).
There are several drawbacks of the phrase-based
model. Firstly it makes an independence assump-
tion over phrases, according to which phrases are
translated independently of each other, thus ignor-
ing the contextual information outside of the phrasal
boundary. This problem is corrected by the monolin-
gual language model that takes context into account.
But often the language model cannot compensate for
the dispreference of the translation model for non-
local dependencies. The second problem is that the
model is unaware of the actual phrasal segmentation
of a sentence during training. It therefore learns all
possible ways of segmenting a bilingual sentence.
Different segmentations of a bilingual sentence re-
2
sult in different probability scores for the translation
and reordering models, causing spurious ambiguity
in the model. See Figure 1. In the first segmentation,
the model learns the lexical and reordering proba-
bilities of the phrases ?sie wu?rden ? they would?
and ?gegen ihre kampagne abstimmen ? vote against
your campaign?. In the second segmentation, the
model learns the lexical and reordering probabilities
of the phrases ?sie ? they? ?wu?rden ? would?, ?ab-
stimmen ? vote?, ?gegen ihre kampagne ? against
your campaign?. Both segmentations result in dif-
ferent translation and reordering scores. This kind
of ambiguity in the model subsequently results in
the presence of many different equivalent segmen-
tations in the search space. Also note that the two
segmentations contain different information. From
the first segmentation the model learns the depen-
dency between the verb ?abstimmen ? vote? and the
phrase ?gegen ihre kampagne ? against your cam-
paign?. The second segmentation allows the model
to capture the reordering of the complex verb pred-
icate ?wu?rden ? would? and ?abstimmen ? vote? by
learning that the verb ?abstimmen ? vote? is discon-
tinuous with respect to the auxiliary. This informa-
tion cannot be captured in the first segmentation be-
cause of the phrasal independence assumption and
stiff phrasal boundaries. The model loses one of the
dependencies depending upon which segmentation
it chooses during decoding.
N-gram-based SMT is an instance of a joint
model that generates source and target strings to-
gether in bilingual translation units called tuples.
Tuples are essentially phrases but they are atomic
units that cannot be decomposed any further. This
condition of atomicity results in a unique segmen-
tation of the bilingual sentence pair given its align-
ments. The model does not make any phrasal inde-
pendence assumption and generates a tuple by look-
ing at a context of n ? 1 previous tuples (or opera-
tions). This allows the N-gram model to model all
the dependencies through a single derivation.
The main drawback of N-gram-based SMT is its
poor search mechanism which is inherent from us-
ing minimal translation units during search. Decod-
ing with tuples has problems with a high number
of search errors caused by lower translation cover-
age, inaccurate future-cost estimation and pruning
of correct hypotheses (see Section 4.2 for details).
Crego and Marin?o (2006) proposed a way to couple
reordering and search through POS-based rewrite
rules. These rules are learned during training when
units with crossing alignments are unfolded through
source linearization to form minimal tuples. For ex-
ample, in Figure 1, the N-gram-based MT will lin-
earize the word sequence ?gegen ihre kampagne ab-
stimmen? to ?abstimmen gegen ihre kampagne?, so
that it is in the same order as the English words.
It also learns a POS-rule ?IN PRP NN VB ? VB
IN PRP NN?. The POS-based rewrite rules serve
to precompute the orderings that are hypothesized
during decoding. Coupling reordering and search
allows the N-gram model to arrange hypotheses in
2m stacks (for an m word source sentence), each
containing hypotheses that cover exactly the same
foreign words. This removes the need for future-
cost estimation3. Secondly, memorizing POS-based
rules enables phrase-based like reordering, however
without lexical selection. There are three drawbacks
of this approach. Firstly, lexical generation and re-
ordering are decoupled. Search is only performed on
a small number of reorderings, pre-calculated using
the source side and completely ignoring the target-
side. And lastly, the POS-based rules face data spar-
sity problems especially in the case of long distance
reorderings.
Durrani et al (2011) recently addressed these
problems by proposing an operation sequence N-
gram model which strongly couples translation and
reordering, hypothesizes all possible reorderings
and does not require POS-based rules. Represent-
ing bilingual sentences as a sequence of operations
enables them to memorize phrases and lexical re-
ordering triggers like PBSMT. However, using min-
imal units during decoding and searching over all
possible reorderings means that hypotheses can no
longer be arranged in 2m stacks. The problem of
inaccurate future-cost estimates resurfaces resulting
in more search errors. A higher beam size of 500 is
therefore used to produce translation units in com-
parison to phrase-based systems. This, however,
still does not eliminate all search errors. This pa-
per shows that using phrases instead of cepts in de-
3Using m stacks with future-cost estimation is a more effi-
cient solution but is not used ?due to the complexity of accu-
rately computing these estimations in the N-gram architecture?
(Crego et al, 2011).

coding improves the search accuracy and translation
quality. It also shows that using some phrasal in-
formation in cept-based decoding captures some of
these improvements.
3 Operation Sequence Model
The N-gram model with integrated reordering mod-
els a sequence of operations obtained through the
transformation of a bilingual sentence pair. An op-
eration can either be to i) generate a sequence of
source and target words, ii) to insert a gap as a place-
holder for skipped words, iii) or to jump forward and
backward in a sentence to translate words discon-
tinuously. The translate operation Generate(X,Y)
encapsulates the translation tuple (X,Y). It gener-
ates source and target translations simultaneously4.
This is similar to N-gram-based SMT except that
the tuples in the N-gram-based model are generated
monotonically, whereas in this case lexical genera-
tion and reordering information is strongly coupled
in an operation sequence.
Consider the phrase pair:
The model memorizes it
through the sequence:
Generate(Wie, What is)? Gap? Generate (Sie,
your)? Jump Back (1)?Generate (heissen, name)
Let O = o1, . . . , oj?1 be a sequence of opera-
tions as hypothesized by the translator to generate
the bilingual sentence pair ?F,E? with an alignment
function A. The translation model is defined as:
p(F,E,A) = p(oJ1 ) =
J?
j=1
p(oj |oj?n+1, ..., oj?1)
where n indicates the amount of context used. The
translation model is implemented as an N-gram
model of operations using SRILM-Toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002) with Kneser-Ney smoothing. A 9-gram
model is used. Several count-based features such as
gap and open gap penalties and distance-based fea-
tures such as gap-width and reordering distance are
added to the model, along with the lexical weighting
and length penalty features in a standard log-linear
framework (Durrani et al, 2011).
4The generation is carried out in the order of the target lan-
guage E.

4.1 Overview of Decoding Framework
The decoding framework used in the operation se-
quence model is based on Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004a).
The decoder uses beam search to build up the trans-
lation from left to right. The hypotheses are ar-
ranged in m stacks such that stack i maintains hy-
potheses that have already translated i many foreign
words. The ultimate goal is to find the best scor-
ing hypothesis, that has translated all the words in
the foreign sentence. The overall process can be
roughly divided into the following steps: i) extrac-
tion of translation units ii) future-cost estimation, iii)
hypothesis extension iv) recombination and pruning.
During the hypothesis extension each extracted
phrase is translated into a sequence of operations.
The reordering operations (gaps and jumps) are gen-
erated by looking at the position of the translator,
the last foreign word generated etc. (Refer to Algo-
rithm 1 in Durrani et al (2011)). The probability of
an operation depends on the n ? 1 previous opera-
tions. The model backs-off to the smaller n-grams
of operations if the full history is unknown. We use
Kneser-Ney smoothing to handle back-off5.
4.2 Drawbacks of Cept-based Decoding
One of the main drawbacks of the operation se-
quence model is that it has a more difficult search
problem than the phrase-based model. The opera-
tion model, although based on minimal translation
units, can learn larger translation chunks by mem-
orizing a sequence of operations. However, using
cepts during decoding has the following drawbacks:
i) the cept-based decoder does not have access to
all the translation units that a phrase-based decoder
uses as part of a larger phrase. ii) it requires a higher
beam size to prevent early pruning of better hypothe-
ses that lead toward higher model scores when al-
lowed to continue and iii) it uses worse future-cost
estimates than the phrase-based decoder.
Recall the example from the last section. For
the cept-based decoder to generate the same phrasal
translation, it requires three separate tuple transla-
tions ?Wie ? what is?, ?Sie ? your? and ?hei?en ?
name?. Here we are faced with three challenges.
5We also tried Witten-Bell and Good Turing methods of dis-
counting and found Kneser-Ney smoothing to produce the best
results.
4
Translation Coverage: The first problem is that
the N-gram model does not have the same cov-
erage of translation options. The English cepts
?what is?, ?your? and ?name? are not good candi-
date translations for the German cepts ?Wie?, ?Sie?
and ?hei?en?, respectively. When extracting tuple
translations for these cepts from the Europarl data
for our system, the tuple ?Wie ? what is? is ranked
124th, ?hei?en ? name? is ranked 56th, and ?Sie ?
your? is ranked 9th in the list of n-best translation
candidates. Typically only the 20 best translation
options are used, to reduce the decoding time, and
such phrasal units with less frequent cept transla-
tions are never hypothesized in the N-gram-based
systems. The phrase-based system on the other hand
can extract the phrase ?Wie hei?en Sie ? what is
your name? even if it is observed only once dur-
ing training. A similar problem is also reported in
Costa-jussa` et al (2007). When trying to repro-
duce the sentences in the n-best translation output
of the phrase-based system, the N-gram-based sys-
tem was only able to produce 37.5% of the sen-
tences in the Spanish-to-English and 37.2% in the
English-to-Spanish translation tasks. In compar-
ison the phrase-based system was able to repro-
duce 57.5% and 48.6% of the sentences in the n-
best translation output of the Spanish-to-English and
English-to-Spanish N-gram-based systems.
Larger Beam Size: A related problem is that a
higher beam size is required in cept-based decod-
ing to prevent uncommon translations from getting
pruned. The phrase-based system can generate the
phrase-pair ?Wie hei?en Sie ? what is your name?
in a single step placing it directly into the stack three
words to the right. The cept-based decoder generates
this phrase in three stacks with the tuple translations
?Wie ? What is?, ?Sie ? your? and ?hei?en ? name?.
A very large stack size is required during decoding
to prevent the pruning of ?Wie ? What is? which is
ranked quite low in the stack until the tuple ?Sie ?
your? is hypothesized in the next stack. Costa-jussa`
et al (2007) reports a significant drop in the perfor-
mance of N-gram-based SMT when a beam size of
10 is used instead of 50 in their experiments. For the
(cept-based) operation sequence model, Durrani et
al. (2011) required a stack size of 500. In compari-
son, the translation quality achieved by phrase-based
SMT remains the same when varying the beam size
between 5 and 50.
Future-Cost Estimation: A third problem is
caused by inaccurate future-cost estimation. Using
phrases helps phrase-based SMT to better estimate
the future language model cost because of the larger
context available, and allows the decoder to capture
local (phrase-internal) reorderings in the future cost.
In comparison the future cost for tuples is mostly un-
igram probabilities. The future-cost estimate for the
phrase pair ?Wie hei?en Sie ? What is your name?
is estimated by calculating the cost of each feature.
The language model cost, for example, is estimated
in the phrase-based system as follows:
plm = p(What)? p(is|What)? p(your|What is)
? p(name|What is your)
The cost of the direct phrase translation probabil-
ity, one of the features used in the phrase translation
model, is estimated as:
ptm = p(What is your name|Wie hei?en Sie)
Phrase-based SMT is aware during the prepro-
cessing step that the words ?Wie hei?en Sie? may
be translated as a phrase. This is helpful for estimat-
ing a more accurate future cost because the phrase-
internal context is already available. The same is not
true for the operation sequence model, to which only
minimal units are available. The operation model
does not have the information that ?Wie hei?en Sie?
may be translated as a phrase during decoding. The
future-cost estimate available to the operation model
for the span covering ?Wie hei?en Sie? will have un-
igram probabilities for both the translation and lan-
guage model:
plm = p(What)? p(is|What)? p(your)? p(name)
ptm = p(Generate(Wie, What is))? p(Generate
(hei?en,name))? p(Generate(Sie, your))
Thus the future-cost estimate in the operation
model is much worse than that of the phrase-based
model. The poor future-cost estimation leads to
search errors, causing a drop in the translation qual-
ity. A more accurate future-cost estimate for the
translation model cost would be:
5
ptm = p(Generate(Wie,What is))? p(Insert Gap|C)
? p(Generate(Sie,your)|C)? p(Jump Back(1)|C)
p(Generate(hei?en,name)|C)
where C is the context, i.e., the n?1 previously gen-
erated operations. The future-cost estimates com-
puted in this manner are much more accurate be-
cause they not only consider context, but also take
the reordering operations into account.
5 N-gram Model with Phrase-based
Decoding
In the last section we discussed the disadvantages of
using cepts during search in a left-to-right decoding
framework. We now define a method to empirically
study the mentioned drawbacks and whether using
information available in phrase-pairs during decod-
ing can help improve search accuracy and translation
quality.
5.1 Training
We extended the training steps in Durrani et al
(2011) to extract a phrase lexicon from the paral-
lel data. We extract all phrase pairs of length 6 and
below, that are consistent (Och et al, 1999) with
the word alignments. Only continuous phrases as
used in a traditional phrase-based system are ex-
tracted thus allowing only inside-out (Wu, 1997)
type of alignments. The future cost of each fea-
ture component used in the log-linear model is cal-
culated. The operation sequence required to hypoth-
esize each phrase is generated and its future cost is
calculated. The future costs of other features such
as language models, lexicalized probability features,
etc. are also estimated. The estimates of the count-
based reordering penalties (gap penalty and open
gap penalty) and the distance-based features (gap-
width and reordering distance) could not be esti-
mated previously with cepts but are available when
using phrases.
5.2 Decoding
We extended the decoder developed by Durrani et al
(2011) and tried three ideas. In our primary experi-
ments we enabled the decoder to use phrases instead
of cepts. This allows the decoder to i) use phrase-
internal context when computing the future-cost es-
timates, ii) hypothesize translation options not avail-
able to the cept-based decoder iii) cover multiple
source words in a single step subsequently improv-
ing translation coverage and search. Note that us-
ing phrases instead of cepts during decoding, does
not reintroduce the spurious phrasal segmentation
problem as is present in the phrase-based system,
because the model is built on minimal units which
avoids segmentation ambiguity. Different compo-
sitions of the same phrasal unit lead to exactly the
same model score. We therefore do not create any
alternative compositions of the same phrasal unit
during decoding. This option is not available in
phrase-based decoding, because an alternative com-
position may lead towards a better model score.
In our secondary set of experiments, we used
cept-based decoding but modified the decoder to
use information available from the phrases extracted
for the test sentences. Firstly, we used future-cost
estimates from the extracted phrases (see system
cept.500.fc in Table1). This however, leads to in-
consistency in the cases where the future cost is es-
timated from some phrasal unit that cannot be gen-
erated through the available cept translations. For
example, say the best cost to cover the sequence
?Wie hei?en Sie? is given by the phrase ?What is
your name?. The 20-best translation options in cept-
based system, however, do not have tuples ?Wie ?
What? and ?hei?en ? name?. To remove this dis-
crepancy, we add all such tuples that are used in
the extracted phrases, to the list of extracted cepts
(system cept.500.fc.t). We also studied how much
gain we obtain by only adding tuples from phrases
and using cept-based future-cost estimates (system
cept.500.t).
5.3 Evaluation Method
To evaluate our modifications we apply a simple
strategy. We hold the model constant and change
the search to use the baseline decoder, which uses
minimal translation units, or the modified decoders
that use phrasal information during decoding. The
model parameters are optimized by running MERT
(minimum error rate training) for the baseline de-
coder on the dev set. After we have the optimized
weights, we run the baseline decoder and our mod-
ifications on the test. Note that because all the de-
coding runs use the same feature vector, the model
6
stays constant, only search changes. This allows us
to compare different decoding runs, obtained using
the same parameters, but different search strategies,
in terms of model scores. We compute a search ac-
curacy and translation quality for each run.
Search accuracy is computed by comparing trans-
lation hypotheses from the different decoding runs.
We form a collection of the best scoring hypotheses
by traversing through all the runs and selecting the
sentences with highest model score. For each input
sentence we select a single best scoring hypothesis.
The best scoring hypothesis can be contributed from
several runs. In this case all these runs will be given
a credit for that particular sentence when computing
the search accuracy. The search accuracy of a decod-
ing run is defined as the percentage of hypotheses
that were contributed from this run, when forming a
list of best scoring hypotheses. For example, for a
test set of 1000 sentences, the accuracy of a decod-
ing run would be 30% if it was able to produce the
best scoring hypothesis for 300 sentences in the test
set. Translation quality is measured through BLEU
(Papineni et al, 2002).
6 Experimental Setup
We initially experimented with two language pairs:
German-to-English (G-E) and French-to-English (F-
E). We trained our system and the baseline sys-
tems on most of the data6 made available for the
translation task of the Fourth Workshop on Statis-
tical Machine Translation.7 We used 1M bilin-
gual sentences, for the estimation of the transla-
tion model and 2M sentences from the monolingual
corpus (news commentary) which also contains the
English part of the bilingual corpus. Word align-
ments are obtained by running GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003) with the grow-diag-final-and (Koehn et
al., 2005) symmetrization heuristic. We follow the
training steps described in Durrani et al (2011), con-
sisting of i) post-processing the alignments to re-
move discontinuous and unaligned target cepts, ii)
conversion of bilingual alignments into operation
sequences, iii) estimation of the n-gram language
models.
6We did not use all the available data due to scalability is-
sues. The scores reported are therefore well below those ob-
tained by the systems submitted to the WMT evaluation series.

6.1 Search Accuracy Results
We divided our evaluation into two halves. In
the first half we carried out experiments to mea-
sure search accuracy and translation quality of
our decoders against the baseline cept-based OSM
(cept.500) that uses minimal translation units with a
stack size of 500. We used the version of the cept-
based OSM system that does not allow discontinu-
ous8 source cepts. To increase the speed of the sys-
tem we used a hard reordering limit of 159, in the
baseline decoder and our modifications, disallowing
jumps that are beyond 15 words from the first open
gap. For each extracted cept or phrase 10-best trans-
lation options are extracted.
Using phrases in search reduces the decoding
speed. In order to make a fair comparison, both the
phrase-based and the baseline cept-based decoders
should be allowed to run for the same amount of
time. We therefore reduced the stack size in the
phrase-based decoder so that it runs in the same
amount of time as the cept-based decoder. We found
that using a stack size of 20010 for the phrase-based
decoder was comparable in speed to using a stack-
size of 500 in the cept-based decoding.
We first tuned the baseline on dev11 to obtain an
optimized weight vector. We then ran the baseline
and our decoders as discussed in Section 5.2 on the
dev-test. Then we repeated this experiment by tun-
ing the weights with our phrase-based decoder (us-
ing a stack size of 100) and ran all the decoders again
using the new weights.
Table 1 shows the average search accuracies and
BLEU scores of the two experiments. Using phrases
during decoding in the G-E experiments resulted
in a statistically significant12 0.69 BLEU points
gain comparing our best system phrase.200 with the
baseline system cept.500. We mark a result as sig-
8Discontinuous source-side units did not lead to any im-
provements in (Durrani et al, 2011) and increased the decoding
times by multiple folds. We also found these to be less useful.
9Imposing a hard reordering limit significantly reduced the
decoding time and also slightly increased the BLEU scores.
10Higher stack sizes leads to improvement in model scores
for both German-English and French-English and slight im-
provement of BLEU in the case of the former.
11We used news-dev2009a as dev and news-dev2009b as dev-
test and tuned the weights with Z-MERT (Zaidan, 2009).

nificant if the improvement shown by our decoder
over the baseline decoder (cept.500) is significant at
the p ? 0.05 level, in both the runs. All the out-
puts that show statistically significant improvements
over the baseline decoder (cept.500) in Table 1 are
marked with an asterisk.
The search accuracy of our best system
(phrase.200), in G-E experiments is roughly
80%, which means that 80% of the times the
phrase-based decoder (using stack size 200) was
able to produce the same model score or a better
model score than the cept-based decoders (using
a stack size of 500). Our F-E experiments also
showed improvements in BLEU and model scores.
The search accuracy of our best system phrase.200
is roughly 93% as compared with 55% in the
baseline decoder (cept.500) giving a BLEU point
gain of +0.30 over the baseline.
Our modifications to the cept-based decoder also
showed improvements. We found that extending
the cept translation table (cept.500.t) using phrases
helps both in G-E and F-E experiments by extend-
ing the list of n-best translation options by 18% and
18.30% respectively. Using future costs estimated
from phrases (cept.500.fc) improved both search ac-
curacy and BLEU scores in G-E experiments, but
does not lead to any improvements in the F-E ex-
periments, as both BLEU and model scores drop
slightly. We looked at a few examples where the
model score dropped and found that in these cases,
the best scoring hypotheses are ranked very low ear-
lier in the decoding and make their way to the top
gradually in subsequent steps. A slight difference in
the future-cost estimate prunes these hypotheses in
one or the other decoder. We found future cost to
be more critical in G-E than F-E experiments. This
can be explained by the fact that more reordering is
required in G-E and it is necessary to account for the
reordering operations and jump-based features (gap-
based penalties, reordering distance and gap-width)
in the future-cost estimation. F-E on the other hand
is largely monotonic except for a few short distance
reorderings such as flipping noun and adjective.
6.2 Comparison with other Baseline Systems
In the second half of our evaluation we compared
our best system phrase.200 with the baseline sys-
tem cept.500, and other state-of-the-art phrase-based
and N-gram-based systems on German-to-English,
French-to-English, and Spanish-to-English tasks13.
We used the official evaluation data (news-test sets)
from the Statistical Machine Translation Workshops
2009-2011 for all three language pairs (German,
Spanish and French). The feature weights for all the
systems are tuned using the dev set news-dev2009a.
We separately tune the baseline system (cept.500)
and the phrase-based system (phrase.200) and do not
hold the lambda vector constant like before.
Baseline Systems: We also compared our system
with i) Moses (Koehn et al, 2007), ii) Phrasal14 (Cer
et al, 2010), and iii) Ncode (Crego et al, 2011).
We used the default stack sizes of 100 for
Moses15, 200 for Phrasal, 25 for Ncode (with 2m
stacks). A 5-gram English language model is used.
Both phrase-based systems use 20-best phrases for
translation, Ncode uses 25-best tuple translations.
The training and test data for Ncode was tagged us-
ing TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). All the baseline
systems used lexicalized reordering model. A hard
reordering limit16 of 6 words is used as a default in
13We did not include the results of Spanish in the previous
section due to space limitations but these are similar to those of
the French-to-English translation task.
14Phrasal provides two extensions to Moses: i) hierarchical
reordering model (Galley and Manning, 2008) and ii) discon-
tinuous phrases (Galley and Manning, 2010).
15Using stacks sizes from 200?1000 did not improve results.
16We tried to increase the distortion limit in the baseline sys-
8
both the baseline phrase-based systems. Amongst
the other defaults we retained the hard source gap
penalty of 15 and a target gap penalty of 7 in Phrasal.
We provide Moses and Ncode with the same post-
edited alignments17 from which we removed target-
side discontinuities. We feed the original alignments
to Phrasal because of its ability to learn discontinu-
ous source and target phrases. All the systems use
MERT for the optimization of the weight vector.

Table 2 compares the performance of our phrase-
based decoder against the baselines. Our system
shows an improvement over all the baseline systems
for the G-E pair, in 11 out of 12 cases in the F-E
pair and in 8 out of 12 cases in the S-E language
pair. We mark a baseline with ?*? to indicate that
our decoder shows an improvement over this base-
line result which is significant at the p ? 0.05 level.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We proposed a combination of using a model based
on minimal units and decoding with phrases. Mod-
eling with minimal units enables us to learn local
and non-local dependencies in a unified manner and
avoid spurious segmentation ambiguities. However,
using minimal units also in the search presents a
significant challenge because of the poor transla-
tion coverage, inaccurate future-cost estimates and
tems to 15 (in G-E experiments) as used in our systems but the
results dropped significantly in case of Moses and slightly for
Phrasal so we used the default limits for both decoders.
17Using post-processed alignments gave slightly better re-
sults than the original alignments for these baseline systems.
Details are omitted due to space limitation.
the pruning of the correct hypotheses. Phrase-based
SMT on the other hand overcomes these drawbacks
by using larger translation chunks during search.
However, the drawback of the phrase-based model is
the phrasal independence assumption, spurious am-
biguity in segmentation and a weak mechanism to
handle non-local reorderings. We showed that com-
bining a model based on minimal units with phrase-
based decoding can improve both search accuracy
and translation quality. We also showed that the
phrasal information can be indirectly used in cept-
based decoding with improved results. We tested
our system against the state-of-the-art phrase-based
and N-gram-based systems, for German-to-English,
French-to-English, and Spanish-to-English for three
standard test sets. Our system showed statistically
significant improvements over all the baseline sys-
tems in most of the cases. We have shown the bene-
fits of using phrase-based search with a model based
on minimal units. In future work, we would like to
study whether a phrase-based system like Moses or
Phrasal can profit from an OSM-style or N-gram-
style feature. Feng et al (2010) previously showed
that adding a linearized source-side language model
in a phrase-based system helped. It would also
be interesting to study whether the insight of us-
ing minimal units for modeling and phrase-based
search would hold for hierarchical SMT. Vaswani et
al. (2011) recently showed that a Markov model over
the derivation history of minimal rules can obtain the
same translation quality as using grammars formed
with composed rules.
