Abstract 
This paper reports on two contributions to large vocabu- 
lary continuous peech recognition. First, we present a 
new paradigm for speaker-independent (SI) training of hid- 
den Markov models (HMM), which uses a large amount of 
speech from a few speakers instead of the traditional prac- 
tice of using a little speech from many speakers. In addition, 
combination of the training speakers is done by averaging 
the statistics of independently rained models rather than the 
usual pooling of all the speech data from many speakers prior 
to training. With only 12 training speakers for SI recogni- 
tion, we achieved a 7.5% word error rate on a standard 
grammar and test set from the DARPA Resource Manage- 
ment corpus. This performance is comparable to our best 
condition for this test suite, using 109 training speakers. 
Second, we show a significant improvement for speaker 
adaptation (SA) using the new SI corpus and a small amount 
of speech from the new (target) speaker. A probabilistic 
spectral mapping is estimated independently for each train- 
ing (reference) speaker and the target speaker. Each refer- 
ence model is transformed tothe space of the target speaker 
and combined by averaging. Using only 40 utterances from 
the target speaker for adaptation, the error rate dropped to 
4.1% - -  a 45% reduction in error compared to the SI result. 
1. Introduction 
One important scenario for the use of spoken language sys- 
tems (SLS) by new speakers is to start with a SI corpus or 
model and have the system adapt as the new users interact 
with the system. Once the interaction has begun, the sys- 
tem has the opportunity to collect speaker-dependent data of 
known orthographic transcription from the target speaker. 
After a small sample of speech has been collected, the sys- 
tem should be able to adapt so as to significantly increase 
performance ompared to the original SI model. The success 
of this scenario depends on the adaptation being powerful 
enough to generalize from a small sample of speaker-specific 
speech in which most of the phonetic ontexts of the lan- 
guage are not observed. Furthermore, it depends on having 
a SI speech corpus which is amenable to speaker adaptation. 
It is a widely held belief that speech used for training SI 
models must be collected from many speakers. It is also 
commonly accepted that collecting only a small sample of 
speech from each training speaker is a reasonable compro- 
mise to make in the effort to collect as many speakers as 
possible. While this compromise may be reasonable for SI 
recognition, several efforts to use such a corpus as a ba- 
sis for speaker adaptation have failed to make significant 
improvements. 
Recently, we have discovered that adequate SI perfor- 
mance can be achieved with far less speaker coverage than 
conventionally thought necessary, but with much better sam- 
piing of each training speaker's peech. Specifically, we 
show that it is possible to achieve near state-of-the-art SI 
performance on a 1000-word continuous peech recognition 
task using only 12 training speakers. Furthermore, we will 
show that it is possible and advantageous to create the SI 
model from a set of independently rained speaker-dependent 
(SD) models, without retraining on the entire pooled dataset 
at one time. Most importantly, we show that such a SI cor- 
pus is an effective basis for speaker adaptation. By combin- 
ing the adapted models of 11 reference speakers, we were 
able to reduce the error rate by 45% compared to the SI 
performance. This method succeeds because we are able to 
apply a robust probabilistic speaker-transformation o well- 
trained andhighly discriminating SD training models. 
In section 2, we describe the new SI training paradigm and 
present comparative r sults for SI recognition using only 12 
training speakers. In section 3, we describe three previous 
attempts to adapt from a corpus of many training speakers. 
Then we describe our approach for adapting to new speak- 
ers from the 12 speaker SI corpus and discuss experimental 
results. 
2. Speaker-Independent Training 
109 Speaker SI Tra in ing  
For several years, the DARPA Resource Management con- 
tinuous speech corpus has provided a testbed for SI recog- 
nition. 109 speakers are designated as training speakers and 
are each represented by a sample of 40 utterances. Typi- 
cally, the data from all the speakers is pooled at the outset, 
as ff it all came from one speaker. Although the training data 
originates from many diverse sources, the forward-backward 
(Baum-Welch) training procedure is robust enough to do a 
reasonable job of modeling the pooled data. When used with 
306 
a standard word-pair grammar of perplexity 60, state-of-the- 
m SI recognition performance for this corpus is 6--7% word 
error rate. 
This performance is 3 times worse than our current SD 
performance using 600 training utterances. Also, the sen- 
tence error rate at this level of perfommnce is greater than 
30% - -  a level of error that we assume is far too high for the 
acoustic omponent of a spoken language system. Further- 
more, this performance has been achieved with an artificial 
and non-robust grammar of modest perplexity which will 
not work within an SLS context. Combining the need for 
higher absolute performance with the need to use less pow- 
erful gratrmmrs indicates that the current SI error rate may 
need to be reduced by a factor of at least 4 to be acceptable 
for SLS applications. 
Results of SI Experiments 
Results for several SI experiment are shown in table 1. All 
results are from first runs of the designated Feb. '89 SI 
test set on the given system configuration. This test set 
consists of 10 speakers (4 females) with 30 utterances each. 
All runs used the standard word-pair grammar of perplexity 
60. System parameters were fixed before running any of 
the conditions in this experiment. The limited development 
testing which we did perform was done only on the June 
'88 SD/SI test set using only the 109 speaker SI model. 
For each condition we show the number of training speak- 
ers, and the manner in which the models were trained and 
smoothed. The training was done either on pooled data 
(joint training) or on individual speakers' data (indep train- 
ing). The smoothing was either not done, or was applied 
to either the jointly or independently trained model. For 
each condition, the word error rate, which includes insertion 
errors, and sentence rror rate are given. 
12 Speaker SI Training 
Since we planned to perform adaptation from 12 reference 
speakers, we needed to mna SI control condition by using 
the data in the usual pooled fashion. We ran a comparative 
test using data from only the 12 speakers from the SD seg- 
ment of the DARPA database. The training for each speaker 
consisted of 600 training utterances. Seven of the speakers 
are male. 
We did have some indication that pooling the data of even 
a few speakers could make large improvements from an ex- 
periment conducted at IBM and described in \[5\]. However, 
12 speakers could hardly be expected to contain an exam- 
ple of all speaker types in the general population (including 
both genders), so we could anticipate the need for some 
kind of smoothing before we began. Our usual technique 
for smoothing across the bins of the discrete densities, tri- 
phone cooccurrence smoothing \[7\], has proven to be an ef- 
fective method for dealing with the widely varying amounts 
of training data for the detailed context models in the sys- 
tem. When used in a SD training scenario, it has allowed us 
to observe a performance gain for explicitly modeling sev- 
eral thousand triphones which were observed only once or 
twice in the training. 
However, the cooccurrence smoothing is not appropriate 
for models derived from the pooled data of many speakers. 
Spectra from different speakers will cooccur much more ran- 
domly than spectra from a single speaker. This will yield 
poorer estimates of the smoothing matrices. As such, 11S- 
phone cooccurrence smoothing is a speaker-specific model- 
ing technique. If the data is pooled prior to training, we 
cannot effectively apply our best smoothing to the model. 
This realization has led us to examine the practice of pool- 
ing the data in the first place. A straightforward altemafive 
to pooling the data is to keep the speakers separated until the 
speaker-specific operations of training and smoothing have 
been completed and then combine the multiple SD models. 
To allow the model combination to be done by averaging 
the model statistics, we constructed a SI codebook which 
was used in common for all speakers.

Table 1. Comparison of SI training scenarios on the Feb. 
'89 test set with word-pair grammar. 
The 109 speaker conditions were run to calibrate the BY- 
BLOS system with published results for the same test set. 
We observe a small improvement, from 7.1% to 6.5% word 
error, for using smoothing on the jointly trained model. The 
6.5% error rate is comparable to the best performance on 
record (6.1%) for this test set which was achieved by Lee 
as noted in \[4\]. Furthermore, the sentence rror rates are 
identical. Lee's system used a corrective gaining and rein- 
forcement procedure to increase the discrimination ability of 
the model for confusable words. No corrective training was 
used for the BYBLOS results given in table 1. 
The system configuration for the 109 condition was iden- 
tical to that which we use for SD recognition except for 
one difference. One new system parameter was added to 
decrease the lambda factors used for combining the context- 
dependent models into interpolated triphones \[6\] by a factor 
of eight to account for the larger corpus. 
Next we repeated the same conditions for the 12 speaker 
SI model. Simply pooling the 12 speakers without smooth- 
ing does not perform as well as the 109 speaker model. And 
once again, smoothing the jointly trained model has a rather 
weak effect on performance. However, we were surprised 
that the 12 speaker model should have only 25% more error 
than the 109 speaker model. 
The final two results show the effect of independently 
smoothing the 12 speaker model after either joint or indepen- 
dent training. To independently smooth the jointly trained 
model, we first trained on the pooled data as usual. Then a 
307 
SD model was made, for each training speaker, by running 
the forward-backward algorithm on the combined SI model 
but on data from only one speaker in turn. This allowed 
us to generate a set of SD models for smoothing, which 
shared a common alignment. The smoothed models were 
then recombined by averaging the model statistics. 
The approach used on the final result is the most straight- 
forward - -  we train multiple independent SD models allow- 
ing each to align optimally for the specific speaker, smooth 
each model to model spectral variation within each speaker, 
and then combine the models by averaging corresponding 
probabilities in the,models. 
As is evident from the table, both of the final methods 
improve due to the increased effectiveness of the smoothing 
when it is applied to a speaker-specific model. In a final sur- 
prise, we find that constraining all the speakers to a common 
alignment does not help. Further, the word error rate of this 
simple model is only 15% worse than our best performance 
with the 109 speaker model and the sentence rror rates are 
statistically indistinguishable. 
Some caution is required in comparing results of the 12 
and 109 speaker models due to two, possibly important dif- 
ferences. The total amount of training speech used is dif- 
ferent as is the number of different sentence texts contained 
in the training script. The 109 speaker model is trained on 
a total of 4360 utterances drawn from 2800 sentence texts. 
The 12 speaker model is trained on 7200 utterances drawn 
from only 600 sentence texts. While the additional speech 
may benefit he 12 speaker condition, the greater ichness 
of the sentence texts may help the 109 speaker model. The 
effect of the additional sentence texts can be seen in the 
different numbers of triphone contexts observed in the two 
training scripts: 5000 triphones for 600 sentences vs. 7000 
for the 2800--sentence script. 
Discussion of SI Results 
We have observed that the forward-backward algorithm 
freely re-defines ome of the phonemes to model peculiar- 
ities of a given speaker. If we constrain all speakers to 
a common alignment, the training procedure must make 
a compromise between these speaker-specific adjuslments. 
Both forward-backward and triphone coocurrence smooth- 
ing are arguably speaker-specific procedures - -  they work 
best when the training distributions are generated by a single 
source. Some compromise must be made for SI recognition, 
where the training is not homogeneous and the test distribu- 
tion is, by definition, different han the training. It appears, 
from these results, that the least damaging compromise may 
be to delay pooling of the data/models until the last possible 
stage in the processing. 
Such a simple SI paradigm has several attractive at- 
tributes. It makes the data collection effort easier. It is 
trivial to add new training speakers to the SI model; no re- 
training is required. Therefore the system can easily make 
use of any speakers who have already committed to giving 
enough speech to train a high-performance SD model. There 
is a large payoff for being one of the training speakers in 
this scenario - -  highly accurate SD performance. In con- 
trast, there is no benefit for being a training speaker for the 
109 speaker model. Finally, by delaying the stage at which 
the data or model parameters are pooled, new opportunities 
arise to use speaker-specific modeling approaches such as 
the multiple-reference adaptation procednre described in the 
next section. 
3. Speaker Adaptation 
Adaptation from 109 Speakers 
As mentioned above, previous attempts to use large popu- 
lation SI corpora for speaker adaptation have met with lit- 
tle success. In \[3\], Lee tried to cluster over 100 training 
speakers into a small number of groups which were then 
trained independently. In recognition, the test speaker was 
first classified into one of the speaker groups, based on 1 
known utterance, and decoded with the appropriate model. 
This approach failed to improve over the SI performance 
since it reduced the amount of training data available to 
each speaker-group-specific model. In another attempt, Lee 
devised an interpolated re-estimation procedure which com- 
bined the SI model with 4 other models derived from a 
small sample of known speech from the target speaker. In- 
terpolation weights for the 5 models were computed from a 
deleted sample of the training data. The reduction in word 
error rate was less than 10%, however, when 30 utterances 
from the target speaker were used. The gain was small for 
this approach because only a small amount of new infor- 
mation, robustly estimated in the 4 speaker-specific models, 
was added to an already robust SI model. 
We have also attempted to use the same SI corpus of 
over 100 speakers for speaker adaptation as reported in \[2\]. 
In this work, we estimated a deterministic transformation 
on the speech parameters of each of the training speakers 
which projected them onto the feature space of a single pro- 
tolypical training speaker. We then trained on all of the 
transformed speech as if it came from a single speaker. The 
target speaker was similarly projected onto the prototypi- 
cal speaker and recognition proceeded using the prototypi- 
cal model. This procedure reduced the word error rate by 
10% compared to the SI result; a minor improvement for a 
significant increase in the complexity of the scenario. We 
believe that this method did no better because the feature 
transformation was not powerful enough to superimpose a 
pair of speakers without significant loss of information. This 
resulted in a prototypical model whose densities were not 
significantly sharper than the comparable SI model made 
from the original data. 
Adaptation from 12 Speakers 
Our experience with the 109 corpus led us to rethink our ap- 
proach to speaker adaptation from multiple reference speak- 
ers. 
We already have a powerful speaker adaptation proce- 
dure which effectively transforms a single well-trained SD 
reference model into an adapted model of the target speaker 
\[1\]. The transformation is estimated from a small amount of 
308 
adaptation data (40 utterances) given by the target speaker. 
The approach is powerful for two reasons: first, the estimate 
of the probabilistic spectral mapping between two speakers 
is robust and generalizes well to phonetic ontexts not ob- 
served in the adaptation speech, and second, the transfor- 
mation can be applied to the well-estirnated, iscriminating 
densities of the SD reference model without undue loss of 
detail. 
A natural extension of this approach to multiple refer- 
ences would be to combine the parameters of several SD 
models after they had been independently adapted to the 
same target speaker. We can assume from our 12 speaker 
SI experiments hat the transformation will perform better if 
estimated independently between each speaker-pair in tum 
rather than from a pooled dataset, since the transformation 
is a speaker-pair-specific operation. We also know that we 
can successfully combine the multiple adapted models by 
averaging the model statistics. 
Results of Adaptation Experiments 
Table 2 shows results for development tests on the June '88 
SD/SI test set and word-pair grammar. The test set consists

Table 2. Comparison of speaker-adapatation results on 
the June '88 test set with word-pair grammar. 
Adapting from a single male reference speaker trained on 
30 minutes of speech (600 utterances) gives a word error 
rate of 6.2%. The reference speaker in this case is, LPN, 
from the designated RM2 database. 
In the second row, a small improvement is realized for 
increasing the reference speaker training to 2 hours (2400 
utterances). We intend to make this comparison more reli- 
able by using the three other speakers in the RM2 database 
as references. 
The third condition shows the result of combining models 
from 11 reference speakers after adapting them to the 12th 
speaker and jackknifing over all the reference speakers. The 
result is a significant improvement i  both word and sentence 
error rates over the single reference perfonnance. 
Discussion of Adaptation Results 
Speaker adaptation from a single reference speaker continues 
to be an economical solution for systems which are forced to 
retrain due to changes in channel, environmental conditions, 
or task domain. With only 40 utterances from the system 
users and 600 training utterances from the reference speaker, 
a speaker-adaptive system can be rapidly re-configured and 
deliver performance equal to the best current SI performance 
trained on 4000 utterances. 
We can also make a comparison between the multi- 
reference adapted result, tested on the June '88 SD/SI test 
set, and the 12 speaker SI result ested on the Feb. '89 SI test 
set, since roughly the same population of training speakers 
are used (except for the held-out one). The two test sets give 
the same performance when tested using the 109 speaker SI 
model. Comparing to the 12 speaker SI model, the 11 ref- 
erence adapted model has reduced the word error by 45%. 
We are encouraged by this large improvement for a 
straightforward application of our basic speaker adaptation 
algorithm to multiple references. Individual speaker perfor- 
rnance ranged from 0.6% to 7.7% error indicating that the 
multiple-reference model was very effective at eliminating 
the poorest outliers. Two speakers performed equal to or 
better than their SD models trained on 600 utterances. 
We intend to continue investigating the potential of 
speaker adaptation from multiple references. If we can con- 
tinue to improve our adaptation algorithm, and understand 
what constitutes good reference speakers, itmay be possible 
to bring our speaker-adaptive performance very close to our 
SD performance. 
Conclusions 
We have shown that it is possible to achieve near current 
state-of-the-art SI performance with a model trained from 
only 12 speakers. This result is possible due to two impor- 
tant changes to the usual SI training paradigm - -  a large 
amount of speech is available from each training speaker 
and the data is not pooled before training. 
Having a large sample of data from each training speaker 
and keeping it separate allows us to train detailed, highly 
discriminating, densities in a SD model and make the most 
effective use of speaker-specific modeling techniques such as 
triphone cooccurrence smoothing and probabilistic spectral 
transfonnation. 
Furthermore, the new paradigm eases the burden of data 
collection for SI recognition and allows new training speak- 
ers to be added to the SI model with ease. 
Most importantly, the new SI corpus lends itself well 
to speaker adaptation. By combining multiple reference 
speaker models which have been independently transformed 
to the target speaker, we have cut the SI word error rate 
from 7.5% to 4.1% using only 40 utterances of adaptation 
speech.
