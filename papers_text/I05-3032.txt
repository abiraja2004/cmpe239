Abstract
Chinese word segmentation is always
much accounted of in ICT-NLP. In this 
bakeoff, two different systems in ICT-
NLP participated. The one is 
SYSTEM_#1 evaluated in three tracks 
-- PK-close, MSR-close and MSR-open,
and SYSTEM_#2 PK-open. Through
this bakeoff , the development of Chi-
nese segmentation is learned and the
problems are found in our systems.
1 System Description 
Two different systems in ICT-NLP participated
the second bakeoff. 
1.1 SYSTEM_#1
The SYSTEM_#1 is implemented mainly
based on the log-linear model CRFs(Conditional
Random Fields). CRFs are arbitrary undirected
graphical models trained to maximize the condi-
tional probability of the desired outputs given 
the corresponding inputs. We cast the segmenta-
tion as one of sequence tagging.
The conditional probability for the tag se-
quence given a input Chinese sentence 
is defined by a linear-chain CRF 
with parameters

is determined using the Viterbi algorithm, An N-
best list of tagging sequences is obtained using 
modi-fied Viterbi algorithm.
Six tags according to the different positions
of one character in a word are used in this model,
such as #START(beginning of one sentence),
B(beginning of one word), M(middle of one
word), E(end of one word), and #END(end of 
one sentence).
The feature templates used in this model are 
listed in Table 1.

Table 1. Feature templates used in SYSTEM_#1
x Any Arabia number like ??,?,??? is 
replaced by mark #N; 
x Some punctuation like ?? ,? ,??? is
replaced by mark #C;

x Any Chinese letter like ?a,?,b,??? is 
replaced by mark #L; 
x All the characters are classified to be 7
types, such as : number, letter, time-suffix,
etc.
In this model, the parameters are estimated
by one Perceptron Algorithm. The parameters
can also be trained through the maximum en-
tropy learning algorithms like GIS or IIS, but
performed poorly in our tests.
1.2 SYSTEM_#2
The SYSTEM_#2 is mainly a HHMM-based
Chinese segmentation system which has partici-
pated the 1st bakeoff in 2003. And the improve-
ment has been made by some post processes.
The system structure is shown in Figure 1

Details of the post-processing are listed be-
low.
x TBL(Transformation Based Learning) is
applied for adaptation  to different seg-
mentation standards. 
x The repeating strings extracted in the test
data using Accessor Variety correct the
inconsistent segmentation.
x A filtering approach to find the unknown 
words in the single character strings is
used.
2 Track
Here ,we introduce the operation of the different 
tracks. Table 2 gives the results of the tracks.

Table 2 . The results of the tracks
2.1 Closed Tracks
Only the SYSTEM_#1 participated the 
closed tracks(PK and MSR) because
SYSTEM_#2 must utilize the POS information
in the entity recognition process.
All the features information used in the 
SYSTEM_#1 were trained automatic for one 
time.
We split the training randomly to two parts?
80% used for training and 20% used for estimat-
ing the parameters. 
2.2 Open Tracks
We participated two open tracks-- 
SYSTEM_#1 MSR and SYSTEM_#2 PK.
For SYSTEM_#1, an external dictionary
which contains 140,332 entries with POS is used.
However, because of the standard conflict, the
open result is weaker than the closed result.
For SYSTEM_#2, the system is trained on 
six-months tagged news corpus of People Daily 
1998 and an external dictionary which contains
22,858 entries with POS. 
3 Conclusion
The result in this bakeoff is  not so satisfied as
there are also many problems in our systems.
Through this bakeoff, we learn more about the
the development of Chinese segmentation. So 
the future research is needed to improve our 
work.
