SUMMARY 
I offer  a tentative answer t o  a quesCion poaed by Leo 
$poetel: 'what type of automata would produce and use struct- 
ures such 88 natural languages rpossess3 ' ?  
loam ChowIcy hae pointed o u t  that natural languages share 
certain common structural caaracteriatics, and he argues that 
these 1ing~ierkl.c universals have implications for our under- 
standing of hum- menta.1 processes. In my The Borm o$ ME- 
--
(1975), I 8ug~est that we should develop a model of human 
mental machinem by'deaigning an abstract automaton which 
accepts progrm-3 haviag the range of structures universally 
found in the eemaatic analyses of sentences of natural langu- 
ages. !Phis article makes concrete proposals about such an 
automaton. 
An automaton ie defined by specifying a s e t  of sta tes ,  
a set  of acceptable programs. an input function mapping pa irs  
of program and prior state into new st* tes,  and a successor- 
state rebation which permits the automaton to move spontane- 
ously from one s ta te  t o  another, either deterministically or 
non-deterninistically. In an automata-theoretic model of 
human  rental processes, sentences will play the par t  of pro- 
grams, automaton-&ate8 w i l l  correspond t o  structures o f  know- 
ledge or b e l i e f ,  the input function will speoify  how a person's 
belief-structure is altered by the sentences he hears or ~ e a d s ,  
and the successor-state relation wil1,correspond to the rules 
o f  inference by which dne derives new beliefs  from the b e l i e f s  
one alread$ h a ,  
A computer is a physical realization of an automaton; but 
an automaton modelling the behaviour of users of natural lmgu- 
age will certainlx be very different from the automata which 
and concentraee on semantic features which appear to be constant 
for all natural langtaages .) 
!Che model I propose turns out,  as an unexpected bonus, t o  
offer  satisfying solutions to a number of controversial points 
of philosophioal logic. On the other hand, it remains to be 
seen whether the model can successfully be extended beyond the 
subset of natural language it now covers; I conclude by listing 
some unsolved problems.

I. !Phis article proposes a t en ta t ive  answer to a question 
posed by Apostel (1971: 22) : ''what type of automata would pro- 
duce and use structures such as natural languages [possessll? I 
Chomsky has pointed out that natural  languages show common 
structural characteristiss: each natural language is derived 
transformationally from a context-free phz?ase-structure langu- 
age.* Chomsky (e.g. 1968, and cf. Lenneberg 1967) argues tha t  
this shows that we have innate psychological machinery for pro- 
cessing language. I have suggested  ampso son 1972a, 1975a:-- 
ch, 8) that an rruitfux way to construct a theory of such psych- 
ological machinery will be to view the relation between sent- 
ence and hearer as analogous to tha t  between computer program 
and computer. Here I wish to o f f e r  some concrete proposals 
about the ~sychological machinery involved in the comprehension 
of natnrgl language, based on comparihg the structure of nat- 
ural language with that of actual computer programming langu- 
3 ages in practical use. 
'1 I insert qpossess ' ,  s i d e  I prefer to speak of languases 
structures rather than being structures. I discuss 
own comments on this question elsewhere (Sampson 
2 I show elsewhere  ampso son 1973b) that this i s  an empir- 
i ca l  hypothesis, despite the findings of Peters & Bitchie and 
others that ang recursively enumerable language can be generA 
ated by some transformational grammar. 
3~hhe theory to be presented here is somewhat comparable 
with that of Winograd (1972), although constructed independ- 
ently. By comparison with Winograd I am less interested in the 
practical problems of cormaunicating with an automaton in idiom- 
a t i o ,  'surface-structurea English, and mare interested in what 
chqacteristiccs o f  the huinm language-processing automatondare 
suggested by those features of English which appear to be 
universal, 
2. It is usual to distinguish the terms automaton and - com-
puter: an automaton is a mathematical abstraction of a certain 
kind, while a computer i s  a phys ica l  object designed t o  embody 
the properties of a particular automaton (cf. Putnam tl9603 
1961: 147), as an ink line on a sheet of graph paper is des- 
igned t o  embody the properties $of a continuous function; thus 
e.g. a computer 3u t  not an automaton, may break down, as a 
graph, but not a function, may be smudged. Naturally, though, 
the only automata Tor which there exist corresponding colpputers 
are automata .which it is both posaible  ana u s e f u l  to realize 
physically; so the  class of computers represents a rather 
narrow subset of the  class of automata as defined below. We 
shall sometimes speak of 'computersv meaning 'automata of the 
class to which actual computers correspond1; category mistakes 
need not bother us if we are a l e r t  to t h e i r  dangers. 
We may define an automaton as a quadruple 
( f, 9, 9 -  Int, - Suc), in which 9 is a ( f i n i t e  or infinite) s e t  
of s t a t e s ,  & is a (finite or infinite) language (i.e. set qf 
strings of symbols), - I n t  is a partial function from 9 X 2 
(the Cartesian product of 9 with $) into f (the input funct- 
ion), apd Suc is a relation on 
- - f P,-e. asubse t  of Y X  
( the  successor.-pltate relattion). 8 is called t h e  machine langu- 
age of 4; a aember of & i a  a proecram. 
We t r e a t  the flow of time as a -succession of disczlete 
instants (corresponding to cycles of a c t u a l  computers). 
Between any adjacent pair of instants, the automaton is i n  some 
s t a t e  - S 8 9, At any given instant, a program may be input. 
If the automaton is in -... S and P L & &, is input ,  the automaton 
moves to the s t a t e  - I  Int(S, - XI); if (g, It) # dom(Int), wa say 
that - L is undefined f o r  - 6 (and no change of state occurs), 
If no program is input, the automaton moves t o  some state - 8' 
such that --- S Suc St, provided there  is such a s t a t e  - S t .  (Other- 
wise, no change of state occurs, and - S is called a stopping 
s t a t e . )  If - Suo is a (partial) - function (i.e. if f o r  each - S 
there is at most one s t a t e  - S t  such tha t  - -  S Suc S ) , the auto- 
maton is deterministic . 
Bn ordinary d i g i t a l  computer is a deterministic automaton 
wh~se states  are realized as different distributions oq elect-  
~ i c a l  charge (representing the d i g i t s  0 an& I) over t he  ' f ep r i t e  
cores in a s t o r e  together w i t h  a s e t  of working r e g i s t e r s  and 
an add.ress counter. The number of s t a t e s  of such an automaton 
1s finite but very large: a simple computer with a s t o r b  
containing 4096 words of 16 b i t s  together with a single working 
register would have on the order of 5 x 10 79736 states.  he 
programs of the machine language of. such an automaton w i l l  
eonsist of sequences of machine words not exceeding the size 
oi the store, and thus the machine language w i l l  again be 
finite. The input of such a program containing, say, - n words 
w & l l  cause the automaton to load these words 'in-t;o the first 
a places in it s tore ,  replacing the current contents, and to 
- 
set the  address counter to 7 .  'Phe successor-state function 
is determined by the number in the addzess-counter together 
with the code translating machine words into in$.%mct2ons; 
whenever the counzer contain8 the number - i the au-t;omaton 
ch-es i ts  s t a t e  by executing the instruction in the  I - ith place 
in seore and incrementing the  :ounter by one, A proper subset 
of the automaton's states a r e  stopping states: whenever the 
storage word indicated by the address counter is not the code 
of any instruction, the  machine stops. 
For any s t a t e  - S of a deterministic automaton, we may use 
the term succession of S for the seauence of sta tes  the auto- 
- -  
maton w i l l  pass through under t h ~  control .of its successor- 
state function, beginning with - S and ending) (if the succession 
i s  f i n i t e )  at a stopping-state. A computer is arranged so t h a t ,  
on entering certain states, it performs certain output actions 
(e .g .  it prints a symbolic representation of p a r t  of its inter- 
nal state onto paper). The art of programming such a computer 
consists of finding an input program which moves the  computer 
into a state, the succession of which causes the computer to 
perform ~ c t i o n s  constituting a solution to t h e  programmer's 
problem, while being f i n i t e  and as short as possible. 
3 A natural language, such as English, is s p s c i f i e d  
iiyntacfically and semantically by defining a s e t  $ constitut- 
ing the sentences of the laaguage together with a subset k o f  
,$* x % ((where ' X * '  denotes the power set of ) ,  such that 
, , , . . , L 3 1- I& iff & is implied by the premisses 4
L L 4 4, ...) - + -  L-(n 2, 0, -3. L  E & whenever 0 1 - i ~ n ) .  - (Jn the 
l i m i t i n g  case,-the n u l l  s z t  $ k iff I& is analytic.) In 
practice, the infinitely numerous members of & are generated 
by a finite set of context-free phrase-structure rules, together 
with syntactic transformations which operate on the s t ruc tu re s  
defined by those rules. The infinitely numerous members of 
w i l l  be defined by a specification of a r e l a t i o s  between 
the seneences of & and a set of arrays  of symbols cal led 
gsernantic representationsg of those sentences, together with 
tr finite set of rules of inference, similar t o  those o f  extant  
formal logics, which permit the construction of a derivation 
containing the semantic representation of $ as conclusion and 
the semantic representations of L , . 5 as premisses

semantic represeatations is defined by the transformational 
rules revealed by independently-motivated syntactic analysis 
fe.g. Poetal L'l9701 1971 : 252f. ) ; although this hypothesis i s  
certainly not altogether aorrect' (see e.g. Partee 1971), it 
seems. likely that the semantic representation o#' a sentence is 
some simple funetion of its.syn$actic deep structure and its 
surface structure. The rules of iaference for natural langu- 
ages w i l l  no doubt exhibit the 'structure-dependence' charact- 
er'iatic of syntactic transformations, as do the rules of 
inZerence of formal logics, cf. Sampson (1975a: 163-7, for th-  
coming) (thus, the term ' X s Y '  - in the standard rule of modus 
ponens, i.e. '{x - O m  =IY, X + . Y , is a strmcCura1 description not 
of all formulae contaiaing an instance of ' 3 '  but only of those 
in which ' '  is an immediate c~natituent of the whole formula). 
For discussion o f  the philosophical problems involved in this 
way of describing natural-language semantic analysis, including 
problems relating t o  the aaalytic/synthetic distinction, cf. 
Sampson (1970, 1973a, 1975a: ch. 7). 
4. It is tempting to view the mind of a speakel' of e.g. 
English as an automaton in tihe defined sense, with the sent- 
ences of English as the programs of its machine language, and 
the rules of inference of English determining the successor- 
s t a t e  relatioa. In other words, some component of the  mind 
of an English-speaker would be a d~vice capable of entering any 
the relation between sentences and semantic representations is 
a function. In practice it w i l l  not  be (ambiguous sentences 
@ll have mope than one semantic representation), so 'the' 
should read 'one of the ... (respectively)'. 
one of a (perhaps infinitely) large nuhlber of discrete s ta tes ;  
hearing (or reading) a sentence w o u l d  move this device from one 
s ta te  t o  another in accordance with de f in i t e  rules; and other 
wler;! related to the rules of inference of English would govern' 
how it passes through different states when not immediately 
reacting to speech (i. ,e. when the owner of the mind is think- 
ing). 
Although the analogy is tempting, extant computers and 
their machine languages are no t  promising as sources for a 
t h e o r y  of the relation. between human minds and natura l  langu- 
ages. The machine language sketched above is not at all 
reminiscent of natural  languages. The la t ter  typically con- 
tain infinitely many sentences, only the simplest of which are  
used in practice; the machine language of 52 contains an enorm- 
ous but finite number of programs, and the programs which are 
useful in practice (those which compute important functions) 
a r e  not typidally 'simple' in any obvious sense. 
Portunately, the machine languages of .thg various extant 
computers are not the only artificial programming languages in 
use. Partly f o r  the very reason that machine languages are so 
different from natural languages, most programs are written 
P 
not in machine languages but  in so-called 'high-levtl' .pro- 
gramming languages, sudh as FORTRAN, SNOBOL, APL, PL/? (to name 
a few among many). We may think of a computer AM suppl jed 
with a compiler program f o r  some high-level langu'fige dH as 
A simulating the workings o f  a very  different,computer, sgy E. 
actually exists: high-level languagzs No such computer as 
8 r e  not  typ ica l ly  me Zachi~le languages of any physical com- 
puters, and there are Undoubtedly s'oupd engineering reasons 
for this. But the abstract automaton 4 may be de~cribed 
j u s t  as precisely as the automaton4 whia underlies the  r e a l  
0 
computer. One who programs an $ Isgstemr (i.e. conjunction 
of computer with deg-compiler) cok-onl~ thinks of the machine 
he is dealing w i t h  z s  having t h e  eroperties of , and may 
be quite unaware of the properties .of the machine-AM w i t h  
-. 
which he is in fact interacting. 
High-level lapguages, aad the  abstract automata whose 
'machine languagest they are, differ from one another in more 
in-teresting ways than do real computers and their machine 
languages; and furthermore (not surprisingly, since high-level 
languages are  designed to be easily usable by human programm- 
ers) they are much more comparable with human languages than 
are r e a l  machine languages. (Typically, a high-level pro- 
gramming language is a context-free phrase-structure language, 
f o r  instance.) I shall suggest tha t  the relationship betweer 
high-level languages ahd their corresponding automata gives 
us much bet ter  clues about human mental machinery than does 
that between real computers and machine languages. 
50 Let me fiitst give an example of a high-level language: 
I shall choose the  language APL (see e.g. Iverson 1962, 
Pakin 1968). AP$ is interestbing For our purposes because it 
is particularly high-level: 5.e. it is related more distantly 
to machine languages of real computers, and more c l o l e l y  to 
human langudges, than many other high-level languages. It is 
a real-time rather thm batch-processing language, which means 
that it is designed to be used in such a way that  the r e s u l t  
of inputting a program will normally be crucially dependent 
on the prior @-bate of the system (in a batch-processing langu- 
age, programs a r e  designed to be unaffected by those remains 
of the p r i o r  state which survive their input): this is 
appropriate f o r  an analogy with human language, singe presum- 
ably the e f f ec t  on a person of hearing a sentence deperids in 
,-- 
general on his p r i o r  system of knowledge and belief  .' 
!Be  complete language APL includes many features which 
are i r r e l evan t  t o  our analogy. For  instance, there is a large 
amount of apparatus f o r  making and breaking contact with the 
system, and the like; we shall ignore this, ~ u s t  as we shall 
ignore the fact that  in human speech the effect of an utter- 
ance on a person depends among other things on whether the 
6 person is awake. Also, APL provides what amounts to a method 
uf using the language t o  alter itself by adding new vocabulary; 
to discuss this would again complicate the  issues we are in te r -  
ested inm7 We shall assume that  programmer and system are 
permanently contact one another, and shall restrict 
our attention to a subset of APL to be defined below: raeher 
than resorting to a subscript to distinguish the restricted 
language from APL in i t s  f u l l  complexity, we shall understand 
'gPLr to mean the subset of APL under consideration. 
'The practicing computer user may find my definition 
the real-time/batch-processing distinction idiosyncratic; 
difference I describe is the only one relevant f o r  our p r  
of 
the 
esent 
purposes, but it is far rrom the most salient difference in 
practice. 
6 In AP'L terms, we ignore a l l  system ins~ructions, i.e. 
words beginning with A, Note that we use w m  underlinin 
(corresponding to bold type i n  p r i n t )  t o  quote b s s e q u -  
encee of symbols from an object-language, whether this is an 
artificial language such as ATL or a natural language such as 
English. 
'hn BPL terms, we ignore  the dqyinition I - mode and the use 
of characters V A : + . 
6. We begin by defining t h e  s e t  9 APL of states of &APL. 
F i r s t ,  we recursively define a set of APL-prop&ties: 
any posi t ive  or negative r e a l  number is a numeric - APL- 
property of dimension #; 
any character on the APL keyboard (i.e. any of a-f ipi te  
s e t  of characters whose iden t i ty  does not concern us) 
is a literal &property of dimension @; 
f o r  any integer I n and integer-string - D, any - n-length string 
over the s e t  of numerio (literal) APL-properties of 
dimedion - D is A a numeric ( l i t e r a l )  APL-property of 
dimension - -  D%.' 
P o r  any finitg string .I D over the integers, any numeric or lit- 
eral APL-property of dimension - D is an APL-property, and 
nothing e lse  is guch. Clearly, there are infinitely many APL- 
properties.. The length of the dimension of an APL-property 
is the - rank of that APL-property. !Phus, a number is a rank4 
numeric APL-property; a four-letter word, e.g. LOVE, is a rank- 
-
1 literal -property; a 2 by 3 matrlx of numbers, 
emgo 3.9 2 l2 is a rank-!? numeric DL-property, etc. 
0 4 .6  937' 
Bn APGidentifier is any rank-? literal string beginning 
'The symbol stands f o r  concatenation (a dimension is 
always an integer-string). Concatenation is a function from 
so we should strictly write 'DAN9 (where N i s

many APL-identifiers. We define Ident as the s e t  including 
all -identifiers together  with an en t i t y ,  assumed t o  be dis- 
tinct from all the APLident i f iers ,  delloted by. t h e  symbol 
- 0 ,  
An DL-object is a pairing of any member o f s Iden t  with an APE 
property; we call the first member of an APL-object the ident- 
i f i e r  of the object and the second memher t h e  proper ty  of the  
-- -
object. 
An APEstate is a finite s e t  of APL-objects in which no 
distinct objects bear  t he  same identifier. (We may thus think 
of an kPEstPt 'e as a function from a finite subset o f  Ident  
i n t o  the set  of APEpropert ies .  ) We write I qAPL1 for the s e t  
of all -states:  c lea r ly ,  *APL is infinite. 
we now define txe lanwage zAPL of AAPL' de,m i s  gen- 
era$ed by the  context-free grammar on p. 16. The i n i t i a l  
symbol of that grammar is - asst  ( f o r  'assignmentt). Since 
capital l e t t e r s  occur among the terminal symbols of $ we 
use miniscules as non-terminals; terminal symbols of 2:; 
are wavy-underlined (cf. note 6, p. 3 ,  whether they a re

We now go 0x1 t o  specMy the function - IntApL from 
aeapL i n t o  which specifies t he  *change of APE

To determine the new s t a t e  arrived at from an arbitrary

ity. 
"1 rgnore complications relating to strings containing 
the inverted comma character, 
'l'l Some of these  function^, and their ~ames, are common to 
all 'dialects* of APL: e.g. 5, which denotes the function 
taking integers i n t o  their factorials, strings of integers i n t o  
the oorresponding strings of f a ~ t o r i a l a ,  etc., and which is1 
undefined 0.g. for literal APL-properties. !Phe f a c i l i t y  of

defined ones. 
' ' ~ . ~ r  denotes the  function taking any programming 
act in to  a etring of integers representing the time of day at 
which it occurs. 
14 There are a number of syntactic complications, akin to 
eyntactic transformations in natural languages, concerning a 
Gadic functf on called index, which is denoted - by square brack- 
ets;  we ignore these c o a a t i o n s ,  and shall not consider 
'index' apart from the other dyadic function$. 
current s ta te  on input of an arbitrary program, we consider 
the phrase-marker of which that program is the terminal string. 
Beginning at the leaves and working towards the r o o t ,  and eval- 
uatinq the rightmoat node whenever there is a choice, we assoc- 
iate each - dacr node with an APL-property as i t s  denotation and 
each - aest node with a change to be made to the current APE- 
state:  the new APL-state is the one that results from the old 
s ta te  by making a l l  the changes associated with the various 
asst nodes in the order mentioned, terminating with the change 
-
associated with the roo t  - asst node (which may of course be the  
only one). If at any point a - dacr node c a ~ o t  be assigned a 
denotation (e.g. because it is realized as an APEidentifier 
which is not the identifier of any ob$ect in the current state), 
the etate-changes already made (if any) are the to ta l  changes 
achieved by that program. 
The rules for evaluating nodes a r e  as follows: 
A - dscr node realized as an identifier denotes the A P L  
property, if any, paired with thaa identsfkr in the current 
state; 
a - dser node rewritten as numname or litname denotes the  
APGproperty denoted by its 'expopent' (i.e. the terminal mat- 
erial it dominates); 
a - dear node rewritten as - deic denotes the APL-property 
given by applying the function denoted. by its exponent to the 
current programminpc-aot; 
when a - dscr node d+ dominates an mf node d followed by 
- n 
a - decr node d+, if d denotes some monadic function f and d2 
-1 - - 
denotes an UEproperty 2 then % denotes the APL-property 
f(~), provided g e dom(f); the extension to dscr nodes rewrit- 
- - -
ten --- dscr df dscr and dscr tf dscr dscr is obvious. 
-
An - aset node dominating a member - i of Ident, followed 
by 6, followed by a dscr node denoting an APL-property E, adds 
* -
a new &PLobject (i, - E) to the current state, destroying any 
object with the identifjer - i which may already exist in the  curr- 
ent stat&-; if I i is - a, a representation of 2 i s  printed out; 15 
a - dscr uode imediately,dominating an - aest node which has 
created an BPEobjeot  with the property E denotes 2. 
As a ( tr iv ia l )  example of the operation o f  these rules, 
consider the program 
input t o  d f L  i n  s t a t e  {(A, (k 1 1 I ) ,  (B, k.r 10)). This program 
has the  constituent structure which appears in Pig. 'I on the 
next gage (in which - dscr and - asst nodes are numbered in the 
order they are to be evaluated). 
Suppose the program is input i n  the morning, say a t  11.30 
a.m. Then dscr will denote the string 11 30 0. The funct ion 
-1 
> takes (12 0 0, I1 30 0,) i n t o  1 0 0, which becomes the denot- 
w 
at ion of dscr in fact dscr will denote 1 0 0 whenever the 
-+3 1311CCIL3 
program is  input  i n  the  morning and 0 0 0 whenever it is input 
in the afternoon (when the hour integer will be 1 4  or more). 
The monadic function +/ adds the  numbers in a string, so if 
- 
dscr denotes 'I 0 0 then dscr,, denotes 1. Dscr denotes 10 
-3 -5 ( identified by 3, so dscr, also denotes 10. Accordingly, 
'21n the  full version of APL. a-can oocur as a rewrite 
. - 
of dscr, in which case dscr is assigned an APL-property input 
by theprogramer at t h n m e  dscr is evaluated by the system, 
We ignore this, since it i n t e r m s  with the analogy with nat- 
ural language. IL the full version it is also possible to 
output symbol-str'ings which do not represent individual APE 
properties; again we ignore this. 
dscr

asst adds an object ( , 10) t o  the current s t a t e  and prints

out 10. The monadic function gives the dimendion of any &PE

property, and ascr, denotes 1 -1 1, so d ~ ~ r ~  denotes 3 ,  and
hence dsor denotes 13. Pinally, asst  addasan object (Q, 13)

In other words, if the program ia input in the  morning and 
the prior s t a t e  is as quoted, the final s t a t e  will be 
{(A, I ,I I), (2 ,  lo) ,  ( , lo) ,  (Q, 13)), whereas if it were

To define f u l l y  it remains only to specify the rel- 
ation Suc, On 4LPJi which controls the changes-of-state 
& r  undergoes- spontaneously. SucdpL is the empty relation: 
every -s ta te  is a stopping state. A programmer working in 
BPL has no wish for tihe system to take actions beyond those 
specif ied by his programs: by defining monadic, dyadic, ,or 
triadic functions of any complexity he wishes, he can g e t  the 
answers t o  hie questions simply by carrying out the state-  
changes specified in his program. (1n the maohine language of 
a .genuine computer, on the  other hand, the state-changes brought 
about by grograme are of no intrinsicr interest, and the input  
o f  a program ie of value only in tha* it brings the computer 
t o  a sta te  from whichit  proceeds spontaneously to perform 
actions useful t o  its programmer. ) 
7. It may seem.contradictory to say that a real d i g i t a l  
computer, which will have only f i n i t e l y  many s ta tes  and poss- 
i b l e  programs, can be made t o  simulate an automaton such as 
which has i n f i n i t e l y  m a n y  s t a t e s  and programs. And, of 
oouree, in practice the simulation ie,not perfect. Although 
an -state may contain any number of objects ,  for. any APL 
computer/compiler system there  w i l l  be a f i n i t e  l i m i t  on the 
number of objects in a s t a t e ;  although any real number m a y  be 
an BPL-property, in a practical APL system real numbers are 
approximated t o  a fini-te tolerance. The m a t i o n  is qui te  ana- 
logous to the case of natural language, where the individual's 
tperfomance ' ie an imperfect real izat ion of an ideal* tcompet- 
ence', in one sense of that  distinction; j u s t  as in linguist- 
i c s ,  so in the case of high-level programming languages it i s  
normal to give a description of the ideal system separately 
from a statement of the limitations on the  realizat5,on of tha t  
system in practice, which w i l l  d i f f e r  f rom one person to another 
in the natural language case, from one computer/compiler pair 
to another in the programming language case. 
Other high-level programming languages d i f f e r  from APL not 
only in terms of their sentences but in terms of the nature of 
the states on which t h e i ~  sentences act. Thus in s t a t e s  of e.g. 
SNOBOL, all objects a r e  character strings; in PL/1, objects 
include not only arrays of the APL kind but a l s o  trees, trees 
of arrays, arrays of trees, etc.  Ijpace doea not  permit a 
survey of the differences between high4Level languages w i t h  
respect t o  the nature of the i r  states. 
8. A t  this point we are ready to begin to answer Apostel's 
question, about what sort of automata natural languages a re  
appropriate programming languages for .  Any answer,to such a 
novel question must' obviously be very speculative; but the 
ideas that fo l low seam plausible enough to be worth consider- 
ation. We do not know with any certainty evbn what the sem- 
antic representations or syntactic deep structures of our sent- 
ences are; but we have seen t ha t  there is good reason to think 
the two may hs similar, and we can make more or lesa detai led 
conjectures about t h e i r  form. In my exgosition I shall make 
various assumptions about aemantic representations, some of 
whiah have already been made f o r  independent reasons by other 
scholars. Insofar as my theory depends on these assumptions, 
a refutation of the l a t t e r  refutes the theory -- this is one 
of the respects in which my theory is falsifiable, i . e .  scient- 
i f i c ,  
I shall present my theory in a *relajxLvely informal, intuit- 
ive Way t o  begin with, and formalize it more carefully later. 
9 What we are looking f o r  is a specifica-tAon of a set  Erin -
of states ,  which we can interpret as sta tes  of some subpart 
of the mind of an English-speaker, such that semantic repre- 
sent\ations of English seqtences are rather  natural devices 
for moving this part of the mind!. from one of its s ta tes  to 
another. It will be convenient t o  have some name f o r  that part 
of a human's t o t a l  psychological make-up which is described by 
speoifging , In earlier, unpublished work I have called 
t h i a  the topicon (coined on the analogy of 'lexicong), since 
I envisage it as coneaining a se t  o f  entities corresponding 
to the objects o f  which ita owner is aware, and to which ha can 
therefore take a definite description to refer. Ln, then, 
is to be a set  of possible  topicon-staeea. me set8  of topicon- 
s ta tes  available to speakers of natural languagee other than 
English w i l l  differ from ( f  17 below), but not in 
respect of the properties on chich thia paper will concentrate. 
Note that a topicon-state is cer ta inly  not t o  be equated 
with a % t a t e  of mind' or tpsychological stateq: a topicon is 
claimed to be only one small part of a human's mental machinery, 
and there w i l l  be many way8 in which the la t ter  can vary -- 
e.g. the human may be happy or sad, asleep or awake -- without 
implying any difference in topicon-state. 
Just as an APEstate contains a s e t  of APLobjects with 
properties drawn from a fixed clase, so a topicon-state will 
contain a set of o b ~ e c t s  I shall ca l l  referents. '6 suppose 
some person - P knows of the existence of a red car - C; then P 1 s  111) 
topicon will include a referent - c corresponding to - C. Thq 
referent a c will be - P 1 s  'Idea1 of - C, in Gehchts terms (1957). 
The possible properties f o r  referents will be determined by t he  
vocabulary of - P 1 s  language, in this case English: each lexical 
item of English will correspond to a referent-property. I 
shall use Geachls operator 5( ) (1957: 52) to form names of 
referent-properties from lexical items: if - P knows t ha t  L C is 
a red car then - c w i l l  have the properties ?(red) MhJ and ?(ear). MMI

physical obdects but referents f o r  any entities of ~ h i c h  - P is

a f iniee number of referents. Given enough time, of course, 
*here is no limit to the number of objects  whose existence 
P could deduce or imagine; and I shall suggest that f o r  P to

topicon will have acquired only finitely many referents. 
90 Consider sentences (2a) and (2b) addressed to - P (and let 
us simplify things initially by supposing that - P does not pre- 
viously know of any red cars -- we shall consider the  more 
general case in 510):

The HP a red i n  (2a) w i l l  create a referent  with the pro-

when he, hears (2b) the NP *he red car will pick out  the refer- 
--- 
ent which a red car has already created (in order to act on it 
--- 
in ways which will be discussed later). In other  words, the 
distinction between the ,Arvrr.MccH- red car and a red car is quite parallel 
N-- 
to the distinction between - dscr and - asst consti tuents,  reapect- 
ively , the  se lects  from the current 
s ta te ,  the latter adds an object to the current s ta te .  Let us 
cal l  natural-language expressions which act i n  the former way 
'identifying expressionst (IEs), and expressions which ac t  i n  
the latter way aestabliahing expressionsa (323s). Clearly the 
IE/EE distinction is related t o  the traditional dis t inc t ion  
between :definiteq and 'indefinitea W e .  However, I do not 
claim that-/all  def inite  and indefinite MP8 count as IEs o r  EXs 
respectively. Consider, for instance, the -- de dicto  / -- de re 
(or opaque referents / transparent reference) ambiguity exhib-

I shall develop my theory with a view to handling the sub-

successfully as it stands. 
men in the subset of Englisli considered here, no t  all 
definite NPa w i l l  in fact refer to referents already in the 
hearer's topicon. For instance, a chi= may come home from 
school at- the  beginning of a new term and say t o  h i s  mother: 
(5) I saw the new teacher r r - E A M . - -  
It may be that  the mother does not  know that  there is a new 
teacher, i.e, it may be that her topicon contains no referent 
for which the  phrase the new teacher is appropriate; but in 
AMh-- 
practice she i s  likely to work out from her child's sentence 
that there is a new teacher, and to understand t h a t  the child 
saw him. other words, this phrase the 
-
teacher a c t s  as an EE to create a new referent in the mother's 
7
topicon. However, it seem8 plausible to say that  this is in 
some sense not the central use of a phrase such as the  new 
w -  
teacher; it-would be more appropriate, if the mother does not 
-
h o w  about the new teacher, for the child to say something l ike :  
(6) There is a new teacher at school and I saw him t- 
~ E k s . e b - - l I M C l - M W I t v - ~  
in-which the referent denoting the teacher is first introduced 
by anaEE aad only then re-identified by an IE. Notice that  
the mother may react t o  (5) by sayin6 something like: 
(7) What new teacher? I didn't know there was one. 
--- f f - v - - J I M M V ( ,  
which would not be a poasible reaction to a sentence using the 
EE a new teacher. 
-- -
What happens when the mother successfully acquires a new 
referent-in response to ( 5 ) ,  I suggest, is that she imagines 
some clrcurnscance in which the new teacher would succeed in 
A - w v - 7  
picking ref eren-t; her topicon -- for instance, if there 
were a new teacher at her child's school -- and, in imagining 
these circumstances, creates the *referent; after which the 
sentence operates on her topicon i n  the normal way. The APL 
system d ~ e s  not work like this: if one inputs the  sentence 
A + B t o  an APL-state lacking an object named B, t he  system 
AhAmmrJ & 
prints o u t  a message pointing out one's error but does not 
change sta te .  It is natural enough, though, that human lingu- 
is t ic  behaviour shows more initiative than the behaviour of 
artificial automata. A programmer has complete control over 
the automaton he programs, and it is easier to require the 
programmer to get his programs right than t o  equip the automaton 
with routines to guess what the programmer means by defective 
sentences. A human speaker, on the other ,had, has no way of 
knowing exactly what s t a t e  his hearer's topicon is in, so it is 
all to the good if the hearer can comp6ffgate in simple cases 
for  defects i n  the speaker's sentences. 
Gince-I shall frequently be speaking of the relations 
between linguistic sqressions, topicon-referents, and th'e ent- 
ities in the outside world which the linguistic expressions 
denots, l e t  me lay down some tsrminolog&cal conventions, I shall 
use denotation f o r  the relation between an'IE and  he thing 
which a hearer takes that IE to correspond to; my theory asserts 
that denotation i8 a composition of two relations, a relation 
of reference between linguistic expressions and topicon refer- 
ents, and a relation of representation between topicon-refer- 
ents and things. Thus, i f  the phrase your car said t o  P now 
-- - 
picks out a ref erenti =, in - P's  topicon,  and if - P owns exactly 
one car - C, then your car refers - to 2, and denotes - C, and s, 
represents - C. We say' that =, is the referent -4 of and - C the 
denotatum of, = car (on this occasion), 
hlCkV 
Notice that an IE may refer, without denoting: if - P has 
C r i m e  Punishment, then h i s  w i l l  two 
referents, say 3 and q, such-that refers to E~

NPs denotes anything (and, correspondingly, 3 and g, will both 
L... 
have the property S ( f  ictional) ) . Furthermore, identhy  of the 
P
denotata of two IEs does not imply identity of their referents. 
Thus, if - P knows tha t  I have exactly one brother  and that  he 
is the new doc%or, then the IEs the new doc to r  and 
--- 
brother will re fe r  to the same referent in P f s  topicon, and 
7 - 
henoe also denote the  same man (the details of reference by 
means of the genitive construction are discussed in 912 below); 
but if - P knows that I have one brother and that there is a new 
doctor, but does not realize t h a t  they are the same man, then 
the two IEs w i l l  refer  to d i f f e ren t  r e fe ren t s  in - Pgs topicon, 
even though each of these referents will in fact represent the

in general (or even usually) be so: when one hears an IE, it 
will often be the case that one knows of a number of objects

the phrase to refer to one among the various red cars of which 
he is aware which is in some way closer than the others to the

they_contain IEs asserting the ungqueness of objects  fitting 
descriptions which in fact  are multiply instantiated. Philo- 
sophers who have discussed reference have treated it as a simple 
relation between expressions and things,  rather than as the 
compoaite r e l a t i on  f o r  which I argue; but they have succeeded 
in this only by devotiag undue attention to NPs, such as Soc-

focus of his attention. This will translate iatm our theory 
as the notion that the referents in a topicon a r e  arrayed in 
some kind of space, one point of which constitutes the focus 
of attention at any given time, The nature of this space, and 
the factors which determine the  pos i t ion  of the referents and 
focus of attention in it,, will be considered in 916 below; f o r

precise. Then we can say t ha t  any IE consisting of the word

The oUvious candidates as natural-language equivalents of ident- 
ifiers are proper names. However, although some logicians have 
di~cussed proper names, under the label sinmlar - terms, as if 
181 can offer no explanation of the  syntactic distinction 
between nouns and adjectives, which serves no obvious semantic 
m c t i o n ;  however, since the distinction appears to be univer- 
sal in natural laaguagGs, my account of English semantiq repre- 
sentations w i l l  incorporate it. ( W e  solution to this puzzle 
ray have to do with the fact that Borne adjectives are 'syncat- 
egorematic' in a way which nouns never are:  a 'goad actor'  is 
not necessarily good though he is necessarily an actor.) 
tney are the equivalent of APL identifiers ( f o r  a summary of 
the alternative views, see Oheng 1968), English proper names 
in fact do not behave in this way. In APL, a s t a t e  in which 
two  distinct objects bear the same i den t i f i e r  is simply not  a 
well-formed s ta te .  In English, on the other hand, locutions 
like : 
(8) Do you mean our Charles or your Charles? 
- *H*J(HICICYr- - - /CCH(-  
The London in En- iz b a  than the London in (9) - , ---#us- 
occur frequently enough: although many proper nouns apply only 
to one referent in an average topicon,  many apply to more than 
one. Superficially, proper nouns seem syntactically distinct 
from common nouns in that IEs containing proper nouns lack - the:
the car, but not *the London. However, Gloat  (1969) has argued 
W I I C C h S .  -- 
convincingly that in deep syntactic s t ructure  proper nouns are 
preceSded by the, and that proper and common nouns are syntact- 
-
ically quite parallel in the base. We shall take it that pro- 
per nouns correspopd t o  properties f o r  r e fe ren t s  in j u s t  the 
same way as commol nouns: London refers to the nearest 
/Hrycrcrch, 
?(London) referent to the hearer's fo,cus, as the car refers 
- M h / \ M L  
to the nearest ?(car) ~ m h  referent. (me problems of how the  pairs 
of IEs  in (8) and ( 9 )  succeed in referring to distinct re fe r -  
ents will be answered in 912 and $15 respectively.) Clearly 
there is a disttnction between names and common nouns in tha t  
the applicabi l i ty  of a name to an object is more 'arbitraryt 
than that of a common noun. But  this distinction is gradient 
rather than all-or-none; e.g. a schoolboyts nickname, such as 
F m ,  will be intermediate in arbitrariness (a boy cal led

ection with IEs involving genitive constructions. The ' bas ic '  
sense of the genitive is commonly taken to be possession, as

that referent is gl, John's car will pick out  the nearest refer-

is not, the car and John's car w i l l  have different reference

the topicon-space in 916, ownership is only oneof the factors 
that may cause a ?(man) referent to be close to a par t icu la r

l9 Deictics, l i k e  o t h e r  
IEs, pick out referents of the hearer's topicon; b u t  their ref- 
erents  depend on characteristics of the  spe'ech ac t  in which 
they are used, and are independent of the arrangement or prop- 
erties of referents in the hearer's topicon. For  this reason, 
deictics  neve? occur as the head of a genitive construction, 
and there a r e  no phrases l i k e  %he you (with ' s  
- - * 
as genitive rather than s h o r t  f o r  is); will r e f e r  to the 
- 
same referent on a given occasion (namely the  referent repre- 
senting the addressee of the speech ac t  -- the owner the  
topicon, unless he is overhearing words addressed to someone 
e l s e )  whatever other referents are in the vicinity, so it would 
be otiose  to modify a de ic t i c  w i t h  a genitive NP. 
34. So far I have discussed only referents corresponding 
to ndun-phraaes in syntax, and representing individuals in the 
outside world. However, some referents will represent what 
would more normally be cal led 'facts' or 'events' than 'individ- 
uals'. Ordinary predicate logic distinguishes sharply between 
individuals on the one hand, and facts or events on the other: 
the former are translated i n t o  singular terms, t h e  l a t t e r  i n t o  
'g~inguiats do not usually include t he  first and second 
person pronouns among the ' d e i c t i c s ' ,  but logically they are o f  
the same category. 
arrays of predicate followed by arguments, and the syntax of 
the predicate calculus does not permit one to occur in place 
of the other. However, in English, if e.g. John -b-t -- the car 
has the semantic representation ' f (a ,  - - .LI b)' (where - f is the  pred- 
icate b s  and - a and a b are singular  terms standing for John and 
$he car), then presumably the  semantic representation of: 
(10) It surprised Mary tha t  John the car. 
- u w - - -  w -  
will have t o  have 'f(a, 3- - b)' as one of the arguments of the pre- 
dicate su rise -- (10) w i l l  have to be represented as some- &
thing like 'g( f(a, 3L - b), ) ,  where g is and c stands 
f o r  Mary (tense is discussed later in this section).  20- If 
''liosenbaum (1967) has shown that  in deep syntax, before 
the application of a transformation called 'Extraposition', 
(10) has the normal subject-verb-object s t ruc ture  with t ha t  
-a b -  the car - as subject. The need to permit proposlt- 
ions as arguments of predicates is discussed by Leech (1969: 
25-6). In the *selnan$ic representations' given here, I arrange 
the predicate-symbol t o  the left of all the arguments, in order 
to clarify the c~mparison with standard logical  notation. It 
is by a qui te  arbitrary choice, however, t h a t  formal log ic  
writes 'f(a, 2)' rather than 'a f b', and when I define & 
Qelow I azll adopt the orderiiig-which more c lose ly  Eng 
reflects the surface stzmcture of English. (Ct is a moot point 
within linguistics whether the dee structures of English sent- 
ences have 'the ordering subject-ver _% -obJect or verb-subject- 
object.) - 
facts, as well as things, may be denoted by su i t ab le  linguistic 
expressions, then suppose t h a t  topicon contains refer- 
ents representing facts (propositional referents) as well as 
referents representing things (individual referents). We w i l l  
suppose fu r the r  tha t  the referents in a topicon are linked in 
a graph structure in which propositional referents dominate 
n-tuples of (propositional or individual) referents ,  corresp- 
- 
onding t o  the arguments of the  respective propositions. Con- 
sider e.g. one who knows that someone called John bought a car: 
his topicon will contain a structure of the  following form: 
In (11) nodes stand f o r  referents, which I s h a l l  c a l l  'r ' 
-1 
* etc. (N.B. I shall always use 'rm f o r  nodes of topicon- 'g2 9 cI 
s t a t e s ,  as opposed to 'dl - f o r  nodes of phrase-markers of sent- 
ences). The lowest-level referents are unlabelled, while the 
higher-level referents are each label led  with an English word. 
'Phe referents =, and g2 represent respectively John and the car, 
while represents the fact that John bought the car. The 
referent r represents the  fact that the thing represented by 
-5 
4 is a car, while r represents the fact that  the thing repre- -3 
sented by 2, is a John ('is called "Johnu1. as we usually say 
in the case of proper names). To say that a referent, say I&, 
has the property ?(car) ,  - is to say that  there is some referent , 
in this case r which dominates the  I-tuple r,-+ and which is 
-5' 
labelled car. 
rcNvc 
A sentence acts as an EE for the establishing of propos- 
i t i o n a l  referents, as an indefinite NP such as a car is an EE 
h A -  
f o r  establishing individual referents. 5 u s ,  suppose - P1s 
topicon contains the structure of (I?), together  with a 9( 
referent, say (that is, is dominated by a propositional 
referent z7 labelled Mary): then P's hearing (or reading) the 
- - 
sentence (j~), i.e. It Mary tha t  John bought the car 
I*N ------I 
w i l l  create in P 1 s  - topicon a new propositional referent, say 
%* labelled and dominating the 2-tuple (3, ) :  - P 1 s  
new topicon-state w i l l  contain the structure shown as (12) on 
the next page. 
In (12), broken lines show the new s t ruc ture  created by 
sentence (10). Notice that propositional referents, like indi- 
vidual referents, may be referred to by pronouns; if r+ i s  
close enough t o  - Pgs focus of attention, the same effect  will 
be achieved by the sentence: 
'(13) It surprised Mary. 
*-- 
The number of referents dominated by a given referent in 
a topicon will corrdlate with the label of the latter referent. 
A n  unlabelled referent will be an individual referent and w i l l  
dominate nothing; a referent labelled with an - n-adic predicate 
w i l l  dominate an I n-tuple of referents.  5 u s  a referent labe l led  
w i t h  a noun will dominate one referent; a referent labelled 
with a verb taking subject, direct objec t ,  and indirect obaect 
will dominate a 3-tuple of refiirents; and so on. In natural 
languages the distinctions between the different arguments of 
a verb are shown sometimes by ordering, sometimes by preposit- 
ions ( t o  /HS or case endings (Johami), e tc .  -
I assume that some individual referents represent points 
of time, and t ha t  one of the arguments of most verbs in natura l  
languages is the time at which the action in question occurred. 
me re  a verb in the p re t e r i t e  occurs with no phrase overt ly 
denoting a point of time, I take it that the nearest time ref- 
erent t;o the hearer's current focus of attention becomes the 
respective argument o f  the new propositional referent:  one 
would not normally say e.g. - John b a t  the mW.-- car unless the 
hearer can be expected to know what occasion one is speaking 
about. In other words, preterite tense picks out the nearest 
?(time) - referent as CHh he picks out the nearest ?(male) - referent. 
McCawley (1971) has argued t h a t  preterite tense and pronouns 
have a cornon syntactic origin, a finding which renders my 
- A  
semantic approach a l l  the more appealing. c I 
Although I assume time arguments f o r  verbs, to avoid c lu t -  
ter I shall not include them on diagrams. 
That - clauses m a y  be used to re fe r  t o  propositional refer- 
ents either as IEs or as EEs, without the distinction being 
markeii syntactically. Sentence (10) (It - m d  t ha t  -
John b-t the car) i s  equally appropriate whether o r  not 
w w -  
the hearer already knows that John bought the car. !Phus, if 
P's topicon contains the structure of (17) (p. 35) ,  the phrase 
- 
that John b- the car i n  (10) w i l l  pick out and create 
-- UlWC- 
the extra structure of (12); but if - P ' s  topicon lacks r+, then 
the same phrase will create a referent labelled- b a  and domin- 
ating - rq (and a time referent) before the rest of the 
L'I A verb in the perfect, as in John has bou ht the car, 
-+ -will act  as an EE f o r  a time referent  , as a ver 1n preter2 
i t e  acts as an IE. These remarks might, however, have t o  be 
modiiiea to handle American usage: one of the  characteristics 
of American English is that it permits the p r e t e r i t e  in circum- 
etances where the perfect would be obligatory -- in British usage. 
sentence creates a node labelled su_lprise dominating t h i s  new 
node, , and a time referent. The absence of syntactic di9- 
tinction between phrases establishing proposit ional referents 
a d  phraseril identifying them can readily be explained. Either 
John bought the  car a t  the time i n  question or he did not; 
there will never be two referents both labelled b s  and domin- 
ating the same 3-tuple of individual referents,  so if - P's 
topicon contains (11) and he hears the phrase tha t  John 
-7
the car then he knows tha t  t h i s  must re fe r  t o  r+ rather  than 
Ccrru"- 
cal l ing for the  creat ion of a new propositional referent. 22 
If there were no d i s t i nc t ion  between the car  and a car, on the 
NHmA#@-.. (vr- 
other hand, he would have no way of knowing, on hearing the 
IP car, whether 9 or some new ?(car) referent was intended. 
ow--& -
I take it that. languages lacking definite and indefinite art- 
icles mark t he  IE/EE distinction for individual referents by 
some other syntactic devices. 
15. The graph structure i n t o  which an individual referent 
enters can be used to pick out that referent by mebs of r e l a t -  
ive clauses. Thus if the car refers to g2, then the IE: 
--
(14) t he  man who bought the car 
- w w N H r c m c l Y - -  
w i l l  r e E a r t o  the nearest referent, say r , to the hearer's

22 It is convenient to speak o f  a topicon's owner as 'know- 
ing' facts about his topicon, j u s t  as it is convenient to anthro- 
pomorphize a computer program and speak of it 'knowingt vari- 
ous f a c t s ;  these locutions are, of course, literally nonsense, 
but they could easily be replaced by longer paraphrases which 
did not commit category mistakes. 
referent labelled dominates a 3-tuple including - r, 2, and 
the nearest time referent. If - P knotvs that the denotzbam of 4 r 
is a man (i.8. if his topicon includes, in addition to the 
structure diagrammed in (12) (p. 37) ,  a referent labelled - man 
and dominating g,), and if there are no tense problems, then 
(14), the man who the car  will refer to g,,

However, note the  distinction between restrictive and 
appositive relative clauses (cf. Bach 1968), A restrictive 
relative clause, e. g, who - b m  E e  czr in (I4), is part of 
an IE: it gives a property of the target referent. An appos- 
itive re la t ive clause, on the other  hand, as in ('l5), acts as 
an EE: 
'Phe man, who b- t he  car is old. 
--- - - -  
In (15), the man acts as a complete IE; when (15) is input to 
w -  
a topicon, the man will pick o u t  t he  nearest ?(man) referent 
w -  h*Hrr 
to the focus (say &), and then the mgosit ive relative will 
create a new referezt labelled buy and dominating & and the 
-
referent of the car, before the  main clause creates-a referent 
label led old dominating G. The funct ion of appositive relat- 
hmc 
ive clauses in natural lGguages is thus quite comparable to 
that of embedded - ass* clauses in APL, 
16. The principle that each sentence received by a hearer 
creates a new referent in the hearer's topicon suggests a nat- 
ural way of reconstructing within the theory the notion of a 
focus of attention9, which varies with the topics  being dis-  
cussed: we may define the focus of a t ten t ion  as the most rec- 
ently-created referent at any given time. The graph structure 
associated with propositional referents offers a way of formal- 
izing the notion of distance between referents in the topicon: 
we may define the distance between any two referents as the 
minimum number of edges ( e  Unes  which link nodes) tha t  must 
be traversed t"o get from one referent  to the other. Thus, con- 
sider the  sequence of sentences: (ihJ John - a car. 
- -- 
(ii) m e  car hit a man. (iii) He dial-e pol ice .  Assume 
--4A*m-- -- 
the hearer's topicon already containe $ referent, say g,, with 
the properties S(~0b.n) - and ?(man). A m r  hearing sentences (i) 
w 
and (ii) but before (iii) the hearer's topicon will include 
the structure of (16), w i t h  the focus at 5 (the referent cre- 
ated by (ii)): 
(16) contains two referents to which he - could refer, namely g,, 
apd I+; r+ is one edge from the focus and ;, is three edges 
away. Therefore the theory predicts that  he in (iii) will be - 
taken to r e fe r  to r+ rather than y,, and this prediction seems 
correct: he in (iii) w i l l  be taken t o  denote the m a n  who has 
w 
been h i t ,  rather than John. (Notice that this cannot be pre- 
dicted from the situation described: when a driver h i t s  a ped- 
estrian, the driver is as likely as the pedestrian to ca l l  the  
police.  ) 
1% We m a y  no* define the automaton which I claim to repre-

The finite set  of predicates of English, together with the 
phonetic shapes of particles such as the and .of, w i l l  be spec-

ific to the English language. I would hypothesize that in 
other respects (17) generates the semantic representations of 
sentences in any natural language, though the rules which 
relate the phrase-markers generated by (17) to the correspond- 
i ng  surface forms will vary from languagsto  language. 
Some of the latter rules which operate in English w i l l  be 
obvious. Thus, subordinate clauses (non-root ' S f  constituents) 
have that prefixed t o  them (replacing the i n  case the latter 
- w 
appears); nouns not preceded by the -are pupplied with - -  a/=;

supplied, or are moved in front of their noun with the relative 
pronoun wh deleted; clauses outside an LE are given commas to 
IvlN 
mark them as appositive rather than restrictive relative 
clauses; etc. Is shall not  attempt to render explicit  every 
detail of the relation between my semantic representations and 
superficial structures of English sentences. 
We may define the set 9 of s t a t e s  of the automaton

as follows. Suppose Pred is the f i n i t e  set of English 
72 predicates, i . e .  the, set - Pr u - Pr u . in (77). Then a pair

account the special rules operating under contrastive stress), & i s  appropriate only i f  the intended referent is the nearest 
individual referent of a l l  t o  the hea.rerfs focus, not merely 
the nearest of the #(male) referents. -

The function Int 
-g 
which determines how a sentence of this 
moves a topicon from one s t a t e  to another is specified 
by rules which associate subsets of the referents of the curr- 
ent topicon state with nodes in the  structural description of 
the sentence; as in the APL case, certain nodes cause addit- 
ions t o  the current s ta te .  We shall write 'Ref' - for the  part- 
fal function, specif ied by these rules, from nodes of the sent- 
ence into subsets of the topicon-referents; in the case where 
a conetituent refers (in our technical sense) to a ~ e f e r e n t ,  
fef will take the  node dominating the constituent into  the unit 
-
aef aontaining that referent. 
The rules determining I n t h g  a r e  as follows: (see aext page) 
a seniforest is allowed to have more than o m  r o u t ,  and nodes 
#we allowed t o  branch upwards as well as downwards. A semifor-

necessarily immedigtely -- dominate is the ancestral of 'imedi- 
stely dominate ' ) by at least one root (i. e. undominated node), 
anQ oc is a partial function of l a m i n  from D into V. Nodes 
outside the domain of 6 are  leaves --Y-+ or ermina'l: noded: Note teat, b$ defining the range ' 6 s  containing strings, I have

a sample sentence and a sample topicon-state. The sentence is: 
(18) B e  man wno c- JohnB s fish, who was bald, knew' tha t

you love t h e  teacher who bought a horse.

Sentence (18) has the foil-owing semantic representation (as 
usual I ignore tense for simplicity). I omit the superscripts 
from 'Pr'  nodes, since they are obvious, and I subscript cer- 
tain nodes f o r  la ter  discussion. 
The topicon s t a t e  to which (19) is input is assumed to be 
as in (20)  below (without the material drawn in dot ted l ines ) ,  
with the current focus at r (indicated by concentric circles): 4 5  
The- owner of the topicon diagrammed i n  (20), t o  whom (19) i s  
addressed, i s  represented in (20)  by g5: he is a man called 
Dick who has caught and eaten a fish, and who loves the  denot- 
atum of s7, who is a woman teacher who has bought a horse. 
The denotatum of g2 is a man called John who has also bought 
a horse and has eaten a fish which was caught by the  denotatum 
'of El,, a man teacher called Tom, who loves the  same woman as 
Dick. 
We now use mles Rl-R10 to interpret the nodes of ( ? 9 ) ,

The relation Suc 
-Eng ' which determines which possible next 
statis Jmg can move to from any given state independently of 
input, will correspond to the rules of inference in the semant- 
ic description of English. Thus, suppose there is a rule 
' x  f i s h  & g; catch x -+ x die a in English (i. e. suppose it is

and occur as second argument of a referent labelled e m .  
Clearly, Lg will be a non-deterministic automaton: the 
single ru lerof  inference mentioned permits two alternative 
successor states for (20). Anydne with experience of construct- 
ing deductions in formal logic bows  that there are typically 
a large (though finite) number of ways of continuing a given 
derivation; similarly, the rules of inference for a natural 
language will no doubt permit many.posaible successor-states 
for any given state. If the process of moving t h r o u e  states 
under the control of the successor-stale relation is .to be the  
reconstruction within the topicon theory of the pretheoret ical  
notion of thinkinq, this characteristic seems desirable: we 
do not feel that human thought flows along deterministic 
channels. 26 
18. Although the effects of most changes of s t a t e  in t h e  
cases of t he  machine-language discussed in 82 and of APL were 
confined to the automata themselves, in both cases cer ta in  
state-changes were associated with act ion by the automaton on 
its environment. Thus, whenever an APL-state acquired an 
object named -3 a a representation of the proper ty  of t h a t  obj- 
ect  was, printed by the system on an output sheet of paper. We 
m a y  imagine that action is linked to thought in this way also 
in the human case. Suppose some referent in a topicon 
represents the person who owns that topicon; then it might be 
that whenever, during a sequence of state-changes controlled 
by the successor-state relation, the topicon acquires a refer-  
ent labelled assert and dominating % in subject pos i t ion  and 
-
some proposi*ional referent E, i n  o b j e c t  pos i t i on ,  the owner 
of the topicon utters a sentence which asserts the proposition 
represented by zq. And, supposing 9 represents some person, 
say John, if a hit referent  is created dominating ( z2) then 
-
2 6 ~  do not intend this paragraph to imply any position 
on the determinism/fsee-will issue. If determinism i s  correct ,  
then there will presumably be laws deciding which out of the 
various successor sta tes  permitted by the rules of inference 
of its language a given topicon actually moves i n t o  a t  a given 
time. Such laws l i e  outside the scope of t h i s  article. 
the topicon-owner hits John. 27 
19. There are two obvious problems Connected with the notion 
that the referents in a topicon, which are supposed to corre- 
spond to the  en t i t i e s  of which the topicon-owner is aware and 
the propositions he believes, are created by input sentences. 
The first problem is that no allowance is made for the poss- 
ibility that speakers are not believed. Thus, i f  the topicon- 
owner hears John, the denotatum of s2, say I b a t  a car yest- 
t d .  I U -  -
erdag, then according to the rules I have laid down his top- 
icon acquires a ?(oar) ~ r h k  referent representing John's new car. 
But in practice, obviously the topicon-owner may choose to dis- 
believe John; what happens to his  topicon in this case? 
The second problem is that it is  simply untrue that a 
person acquires bel iefs  about the existence of entities and the 
truth of propositions only by being told about them, I may 
come to believe that there exists a red car either because 
John tells me that he has bought a red car and I believe h i m ,  
or because I see the red car; similarly, I may come to believe 
that John bought the red car either because he t e l l s  me so or 
because I watched the transaction take place. The car may 
subsequently be denoted by the phrase the red car, and the pro- 
w-- 
position about it by the clause that  John bought the red car, 
h c u m - N c r k * N c - ~ -  
irrespective of whether the referents r e w t . s e h t ~ ~  the car and the 
proposition were ere-ated in response to speech or observation, 
27~hesa remarks may sound as if I an! t r ea t ing  humans as 
mindless robots -- 'automata1 in the pejorative, deterministic 
sense -- but quite the reverse: remember that the referents 
whose creation correlates with the topicon-owner's actions are 
brought in to  being by the process we have identified with think- 
ing. There is nothing disrespectful to our species in suggest- 
ing that our actiens are  controlled by our thought. 
The answers to these problems are related. I suggest 
that the sight of John buying a car ia the kind of input  to a 
person that ha8 the effect on his topicon which I have so far 
attributed to the hearing of the sentence John b-t a car (or 
- #--- 
John b=t the c a r  if the car is one of which the topicon 
- --' 
owner is already'aware): in other words, this sight creates 
a referent labelled buy and dominating referents representing 
-
John and the car. On the other hand, hearing, say, Mary utter- 
ing %he words John -b m t  -- a c a r ,  or hearing John say I b-t 
#v- 
a car, has a more complex effect than I have been suggesting: 
c.L- 
it creates a node label led assert dominating the referent 
7 
representing Mary (or John) together with a new buy referent 
28 -as already mentioned. 
I diagram the two cases in (21) and ( 2 2 ) ,  on the next page. 
The part of the diagram in solid lines is the  same in each case, 
and represents part of the hearer's topicon before the change 
of state.  In (21) the dotted l i nes  represent the  effect on 
the t o p i c a  of aeeing John buy a car; in t h i s  case, since the  
topicon owner sees the car, r e  may assume t ha t  he adds some 
further facts about it (such as that  it is red) to his topicon. 
In (22) the  dotted lines show the r esu l t  instead of hearing 
John say I b s t  a car. In this case, the referent represent- 
- NW 
ing the car will be dominated jus t  by the car node and the  
-
node, since the hearer has no independent information about it. 
2%oss (19'70) and others have claimed that there is actu- 
ally syntactic evidence t h a t  J J  b m  % s r  has a deep struct- 
u r e  something l i k e  I sert tfi John ou ht agar.  Ross's + arguments are attacEed by raser WO b e y s o n  (1970), Bat th-  
ews (1972). My theory is intended to be independent of Ross's 
claim, although the la t te r ,  if accepted, would possibly make 
my theory seem more plausible, 


Notice that ,  if John t e l l s  you he has b ~ u g h t  a car, you 
may well doubt that he has bought a car but you a r e  not free 
in the same way to doubt that John has asserted tha t  he has 
bought a car. You m a y ,  of course, doubt the la t te r  also -- 
'Did he keally say the words I thought I heard him say?', 'Can 
I be sure it was really John speaking?' -- but t h i s  is to doubt 
the accuracy of one's observations, as one may doubt whether 
John bought a car after watching him buy it, rather than doubt- 
ing the truth of what is said to one. 
Clearly there are enormous problems about how observations 
via the senses of a complex and continuous environment result 
in topicon changes corres@onding to the input of a discrete 
sentence: why should my view of John handing over a cheque 
on the car-dealer's forecourt change my topicon in the way 
which corresponds t o  the sentence John b a t  a car, rather - -- 
than any of the (surely) infinitely many other propositions 
which could be corroborated on the evidence of my current 
visual, auditory, etc. inputs? However, these problems are in 
no sense created by the topicon theory: these a r e  already 
familiar problems in psychology and in the philosophy of science. 
(Cf. e.g. Hanson 1948, Gregory 1970.) Some process of deriving 
discrete propositional beliefs from continuous sensory input 
must occur, if observation is to be relevant to propositional 
knowledge at all. Since this process i s  known t o  exist indep- 
endently of my theory, and since I can make no contribution to 
maerstanding is, I shall not consider it fur ther .  
Once we agree to treat simple declarative sentences as 
creating propositional referents labelled assert, there is no 
-
special diMiculty in handling sentences performing other i l l o c -  
r l t ionary  acts; e.g. - Shut - the door! -will establish a command 
P 
referent dominating referents representing speaker, hearer, and 
the proposition that  the hearer will shut the door. 
Rules of inference may permit referents representing facts 
about the world to be created on the basis of referents repre- 
senting facts about assertions. Suppose, f o r  instance, tha t  
there is a rule of inference which we might s ta te  as 
'x - a-t ;e, -- x t r u t h f u l  -+ ;E t r u e ' ;  - then a topicon including 
referents representing the f a c t  that John i s  t r u t h f u l  and me 
fact that John asserted t h a t  he bought a car w i l l  be able to 
move to a s t a t e  in which the representation bf the proposition 
asserted by John is &true) ,  - as shown: 
Similarly, one can imagine thaf there might be rules of infer- 
ence taking a topicon from the s ta te  created by the reception 
of S k t  the door! to a s t a t e  which causes the topicon-owner to 
--- 
shut the door. However, here we come close to the point at 
which my theory in its present s ta te  breaks down; I defer ais- 
cussing this 
20. According to the theom I have sketched, English as 
gram@ language is not dissimilar to DL, SNOBOL, etc, 
resembles the l a t t e r  in that i t s  states consist of arrays 
~ b j e c t s  &awn from a specified class (although the precis 
structure of the arrays is different as between English a 
the artificial programming languages, as it ie between the 
latter themselves), and io. that the structural descriptions of 
I t s  sentences include a subclass of nodes which pick out  obj- 
ects from the current s ta te  and another rsubclass which add new 
objects t o  the current state. English differs from &PL, SNO- 
BO&, etc., in lacking identifiers, and in using the property 
of distance between objects in a state  in order t o  identify 
objects. 
My theory is certainly inadequate to account f o r  many 
quite elementary facts about English and other natural langu- 
ages. If may be tha t  i ts  deficiencies are t o o  great f o r  the 
theory t o  merit consideration. However, I would argue that it 
i s  rlorth according my theorg the temporary immunity from fals- 
i f b a t i o n  to which Lakatos (1970: 179) suggests new =,search 
propammes are ent i t led,  in Gaae anyone can suggest modific- 
ti*Xons wfiIcB preserve i t s -ga&goints  while removing its 
4ef ects,  
21. Before discuseing the objections to it, let me mention 
a number of points to which my theory offers satisfactory 
soltatioas. 
In the first place, the theory is attractive simply becau- 
se it offers an answer (emn i t t h e  answer eventually turns o u t  
to be wrong) t o  the question why humans should spend so much 
of' their time exchanging the abstract structures called 'sent- 
ences': unlike cultivating the ground or building houses, the 
utility of this occupation is not immediately apparent to the 
observer (Sampsan 1972a, 1 9 7 5 ~  133-6). In my theory, the 
exchange of sentences, like direct, observation 'of the environ- 
ment, helps humans build up a complex but finite 'map-' Or 
'model' of the world, a model whtch can be described in quite 
* 
concrete terms and which controls the human's actions in mys 
which, again, in prindiple should be quite expl ic i t ly  defin- 
able. 
The notion tmodel' is of course g- central one in the most 
influential current view of what language is for -- the view 
which explicates natural-language semantics in terms of 'model 
theory'. B U ~  the 'possible worlds ' of model theory, unlike 
the topicons o f  my theory, are infinitely complex entities 
which can hardxy be taken to represent characteristics of 
finite human minds. Burthemore, in the model-theoretic 
approach to nratural language, the point about a true sentence 
i s  that it aenotee the Bregean truth-value True (see e.g. wppes 
1973); but if we think of the act of uttering a true sentence 
as the act of aenating the Tme, then it is quite unclear why 
people sBou?d utter sentences ( l e t  alone why tneg should utter 
one t rue sentence rather than another). 29 [~oo tno te  on p.59a] 
In my theory, t o  utter a par t icular  true sentence to a hearer 
is to .make a part icular  change to his mental model of the world 
which gives the hearer more premisses from which to predict  the  
consequences of his  actions; thus, the more t rue  sentences a 
person hears, the more rational his actions can be. 
theory has some more specific points in its favour. 
It explicates neatly some syntactic/semantic dist'inctions which 
seem rather pervasive in natural language bdt which have res- 
i s t e d  other attempts at explication: the definite/indePinite 
distinction in noun-phrases, the restrictive/appo&ive distinct- 
ion in relative cxaflses. Also it neatly explains the genitive 
oonstruction. Acoounts of the genitive which treat it in terms 
of possessioh (e.g. Suppes 1973: 382-3) a r e  simply W a i t h f u l  
t o  the facts; it seems that any relation between the denotatum 
of the head Ell? and that of the genitive NP in a genitive phrase 
can be used to upderatand such a phrase, but this makes sense 
only if, for a given hearer, there are  a well-defined, limited 
set of relations between denotata -- as qoy theory asserts. My 
theory .shows how it can be that definite descriptions succeed 
in referring even thougb,, contrary t o  Russell's theory of 
descriptions, the properties they mention are typically not 
iniquely instantiated -- and, more remarkably, in the  case of 
pronouns no properties of the denotatum are. specifies at a l l .  
My theory ie also satisfying in i ts  treatment of presupp- 
oeitione. Although the fact that sentences typically embody 
preeuppoektions has by now received much discussion in linguist- 
i ce ,  it has not been clear how the distinction between aasert- 
2%or objections to model theory as a means of explicating 
natural-1-a e semantics and pragmatics, cf. Sampson (1974, 
1975b), Patts f 4975), Jaraing & Jardine (1975). 
ions and presuppositions should be represented in terms of syn- 
tact ic  or semantic descriptions. One proposal (cf. Fillmore 
1969, .&&off 1969, Horn 1970) is that the semantic description 
of a sentence should be a pa i r  of objects,  one element repre- 
sentingX9qe proposition asserted and the other the proposition 
presupposed. This proposal is problematical, first because it 
seems arbitrary - why should a sgmantic description of a sent- 
ence consist of a pair of propositions rather than one propo- 
s i t i o n  or a 5-tuple of propositions? -- and, more seriously, 
because it is not clear that  there  is in general dust one or 
even any fixed number of propositions presupposed by a sentence, 
as there i s  just one proposition asserted by a sentence. Thus, 
the sentence: 
(24) The car which John bought i e  red. 
- - - r h M C C r C r - c h M . -  
presupposes that  John b- a car, but also presumably tha t  
(ChhM & -  
there ie someone called John; John's car perhaps presupposes 
-w----- -- 
that JohD bought a car, but perhaps alludes to the fact that 
John was almost mm down by a car, etc. e tc .  On my theory, 
failure of presupposition occurs when the input sentence is 
undefined for the current topicon-state. (24) will f a i l  if 
there is no triple z,, , r-+ of referents in the current s t a t e  
such that % ie ( S )  , is ?(car), vCMk z3 is labelled s, and 
%3 immediately dominates ( 2). To say that (24) presupp- 
oses that John b e t  a ear corresponds to the fac t  tha t  if 
-- ck- 
the latter phrase does not pick out  any current referent; by the 
rules R 4 R I O  which define the function Xnt 
-Eng ' then $he sent- 
ence ( 2 4 ) l  F a i l  t-o create a node labelled assert --- i . e .  
will fail to make an assertion. Presupposition-failure is 
quite &;in to the case in APL when a - dscr node is realized as 
an identifier belonging to no current object, or as a function 
together with a set of arguments falling outs'ide the domain of 
that function; in the APL case, higher - asst  nodes will f a i l  to 
create corresponding APL-objects, as the sentence (24) fails 
t o  create either  a referent labelled red or one labelled assert 
nMh -
in a topicon lacking zqe3. 
I have argued elsewhere (l972b) that  the reason why the 
Liar paradox does not render English inconsistent is that, as 
a matter of observable fact ,  a definite description in a natural 
language ia never taken by naive native speakers to refer to 
a propoeition asserted by the sentence in whic*h tha t  defihite 
deeoription occurs, whether or not  paradox would r e s u l t  if it 
were. 'Phi@ immediately raises the question why natural  langu- 
agee should have such a convenient property. My theory explains 
this simply: in natural languages, as in APL, in t e rp re t a t ion  
of nodee takes place not simultaneously but sequentially, from 
the boetom upwards. A t  the time the referent of the NP what I 
- -  
am now e a  is to be locafed, the referent ta be cr-aated by 
w-  
the, eentenas cwhat I am now is false cannot yet have 
w w H w -  -- 
been brought i n t o  existence, so the possibility tha t  the two 
letgh'b be identiaal does not  arise. 
%!he theory aleo explaine the puzzling fact  that 
(25) Soott: is iientical to the author of 'Waverley'. 
-Chrc--- --

(26) will pick out the same referent, say g,, twice, and create 
a referent label led ident ica l  and dominating (r r ) but we 
- -1 ' -?I 
may assume that a rule of inference of English s ta tes  that any- 
thing is i den t i c a l  to itself, i.e. tha t  a referent  labelled 
identical may always be created dominating (r r ) f o r  any 
- -x' --x 
re fe ren t  - rx. Therefore the input sentence acEievZs nothing 
that the s~ccessor-s ta te  r e l a t i on  could not have achieved inde- 
pendently of any input. In the case of ( 2 5 ) ,  however, if the  
hearer does not  know that S c o t t  is the  author of 'Waverleyf, 
then t h e  two NPs will pick out different referents r,,, 3 in 
his topicon and w i l l  create an iaentical node dominating -
clearly'no Ehglish rule of inference w i l l  do this. r 1, 9 4 30 
The composite nature of the denotation relation incorpor- 
a t e d  within my theor;tr copes neat ly with the fac t  t ha t  natural 
languages use exactly the same syntactic devices f o r  discuss- 
ing characters in f i c t i o n ,  and the l i k e ,  as f o r  discussing real 
entities. Anyone who has read C r i m e  - and Punishment will under- 
stand the sentences: 
(27) Raskolnikov killed Alena Ivanovria. 
---- 
(28) ~ l k a  Ivanovna killed Raskolnikov. 
---- 
and will agree that the former is t rue  and the l a t t e r  false. 
3 0 ~ t r i c t l y  speaking, (25). will create an assert node ,dom- 
inat ing the ref @>pent representing the utterer m) and the 
t ical  --- node mentioned. We may assume that  one of 
,a Sue,_ lays down that when two dis t inc t  node 
the rule 
phrases

replaced by a single referent  connected with a l l  tEe r e f E e n t s  
to-which e i the r  - r-or - rt were linked. 
Y e t ,  in t he  case of formulae of the predicate calculus such as 
f(a, b), f(b, a), if a or b lack denotation then the formulae 
-3 - I L  - LI I I )  
as wholes seem to be ei ther  both fa lse  or both meaningless, 
but not interestingly dif ferent .  Reichenbach (1947: 549) has 
offered a logic  which includes representations of sentences 
about fictional entities, but in his system the symbol-arrays 
corresponding to NPs having fictional referents are qu i t e  d i f f -  
erent in kind from those corresponding to NPs having r e a l  refer- 
ents. There is no trace of such a distinction in the syntax 
of natural  languages. In my theory, the NPs Raskolnikov and 
Richard. Nixon work in exactly the same way as each o the r  -- 
w- 
they each pick  out one of the referents in the hearer's top icon  
-- so it is natural that the NPs are syntactically parallel. 
The fac t  that  the referent of Baskolnikov will have the proper- 
ty $(fictional) while that of Richard Nixon has the property 
P --
?(real) - is no mode reason to distinguish sentences (27 )  and 
(28) from sentences about Richard Nixon and Sp i ro  Agnew syntact- 
i ca l ly  than is the fact that the referent  of Raskolnikov has 
the property J(~ussian) while that of: - Nixon has the proper ty  
?(~merican). -31 -
3'~he topicon theory thus seams t o  make some sense of the 
ontological views of Meinong (79l3) and the ear ly  Russell (cf. 
Linsky 1967: 2 ) .  Meinong was troubled by the  t r u t h  of e.g. 
(i) Pegasus does not exist. 
---- 
since, if Pegasus real ly does not exist, there appears to be 
nothing which (i] can be about, and thus (i) cannot make a t rue  
statement. Meinorig therefore suggested (382-3, 491) t h a t ,  
although it was true of only .some definite descriptions that 
their denotata actually existed, the denotatum of any'de~inite 
description had quasi-existence, and t h i s  was enough-for an 
e n t i t y  to serve as the sub~ec t  of a statement. In our terms, 
to 'denote a quasi-existent object1 is to refer to a referent; 
to 'denote ,an existent~ob~ect~ is t o  refer to a referent having 
a denotatum. 
Finally, my theory suggests why there are t h r e e  categories 
of Austinian 'speech acts'. Austin (1962) dist'inguished (not 
consistently, admittedly) between locutionary a c t s  (speaking), 
illooutionary acts (doing something, e.g. giving an order, - in 
speaking), and perlocutionar~ acts (achieving some effect, e.g. 
causing the hearer t o  perform an action, through speaking). 
(A number of current commentators on Austin would not agree 
w i t h  presentation of his distinctions; however, believe 
my discussion is f a i t h fu l  to Austin's own views in much of - How 
t o  Do Things w i t h  Words.) Why should there be j u s t  three 
_ 1  -
categories of speech act, rather than two or four? Some schol- 
ars have suggested that the three-category analysis is incorr-  
ect; but I would support it. Consider t he  various consequences 
speaking. the first level, sound produced ; the pro- 
duction of this sound is a locutionary act. If the sound is a 
well-formed sentence of English which is defined by the  input  
function f o r  the hearer's topicon state, then t ha t  sentence 
produce6 a specific effect on the  hearer's topicoll: the pro- 
duction of t h i s  effect  i s  an illocutionary act of the type 
defined by the label of the topmost new referent. Thus, if the 
sentence adds t o  the topicon a referent labelled assert the 
%Puw--' 
illocutionary act is one of assertion; the 'misfiring' of an 
illocutionary act ,  as when a sentence syntactically in declar- 
ative form fails -t:o make an assertion because one of i t s  defin- 
ite descriptions f a i l s  to r e f e r ,  corresponds to failure to 
create an assert referent i n  the hearer's topicon. (We have 
-
seen that, when a subordinate node cannot be evaluated, process- 
ing of the phrase-marker s tops . )  The new topicon state may 
lead other t opicon states perhaps, to actions the 
hearer's part ,  via the successor-state relation: the product- 
ion  of such effects  may be identified with Austin's perlocution- 
ary acts. My theory predicts that the illocutionary force of 
a given sentence should be well-defined and drawn f rom a finite 
class of illocutionary types (corresponding to the possible 
l abe l s  of sentent ia l  phrase-marker r o o t s ) ,  while (since ma; 
is non-deterministic) the perlocutionary e f f e c t s  may be many 
and various; t h i s  seems to accord with Austin's discussion. 32 
22. Having presented my theory and discussed the respects 
in which it seems successful, I must now discuss i t s  many inad- 
equacies. Some aspects of English have been omitted from the 
present account simply for the sake of brevity; I believe 
there is no d i f f i c u l t y  of principle in expanding my account to 
handle e.g. plurality, co-ordination yvith and, prepositions, 
-
adverbs, modality, and most subordinate clauses. But  a number 
of English constructions present greater problems. These - 
include, f o r  instance, negation and universal quantification. 33 
For negation, one might th ink  of treating no t . a s  a monadic 
- 
predicate whose argument is a proposition, so that,  e.g., John 
-
did not b z  a car would have the same effect on a hearer's 
0vuu'-- M -  
topicon as - John b a  a oar, followed by the creation of a 
0 - M M  
3 2 ~ n  the framework of my theory, the ~locutionary/illocut- 
ionary distinction becomes rather parallel to the distinction 
between seein and seein as which exercised Wittgenstein and 
other ph dosop ears. *e duck-rabbit picture (cf. Hanson 
l958) if light reflectedprom that picture stimulates my o p t i c  
I eee it as a duck, if this stimulation leads to the :::;ion of a ~ ( Z E C I ~ )  - re*erent in topicon. 
33The fact that these two constructions should both be 
problematic i s  no coincidence. We can handle sentences whose 
translations i n t o  predicate calculus involve existential'quant- 
i f ica t ion ,  e.g. '&r)(c(x) & b(;i, 5) ) '  f o r  J b a t  a car;

one might think of interpreting e.g. All love John as

inadequate: t h e  sentence i s  about, not the par t i cu la r  g i r l s  
the hearer knows of when he hears it u t t e r ed ,  but  a l l  g i r l s  
whatsoever. A related point is that the  meory  does not handle 
the generic sense of definite NPs, as* The ele_phant is a

340ne approach to these problems might involve introducing 
referents representing muniversalsf (in the  l o g i c a l  sense), so 
that for an individual referent t o  have the  proper ty  ?(gir l )  
or g ( e ~ )  would be f o r  that re fe ren t  t o  be one of m u n -  
ordere s e t  of individual  referents dominated by the referent  
representing the universal irl or e-t (in which case the 
notion of 'labelling' proposl % xonal referents might be dropped). 
Then the propositional referent created by All irls l o v  John 
would l i n k  the re fe ren t  representing the  unlversa -+?F w i  h 
t he  individual  referent $or John. It remains to be seen whether 
an adequate eolution can be produced along these lines. 
"I am not  sure whether the opaque/transparent reference

Another deficiency of the present theory is that the re  
are phrase-markers generated by (17) whose effects  are  not 
specified by R1-10, e.g. phrase-markers in which NP is rewrit- 
ten wh S. I hope tha t  an account of the  unexplained construct- 
ions in the  above list may turn out to involve uses for the 
phrase-markers which are not handled by R1-10, but I have no 
idea whether this will be so, 
23. I am not at present clear how to adapt my theory to acc- 
ount for these constructions, and, since they include some very 
basic ones, my discussion of the nature of the automaton under- 
lying a hearer's linguistic a b i l i t i e s  may be worthless. How- 
ever, although my theory may be rejected, it would seem t h a t  
there must be some adequate theory of the  human comprehension 
of language in terms of automata whose states are  of finite 
complexity. An account "of natural-language semantics in terms 
of infinitely large sets  of, in general, infinitely complex 
possible  worlds cannot be the whole t r u t h  about how finite 
human beings understand language. I hope, therefore, that the 
inadequacies of the above account may spur others  to improve on 
my work.

opaque sense it picks out one of the  referents. representing 
John's referents. But clearly this needs to be spelLed out 
more fu l ly  than I have done. A D. Phil. thesis currently being 
prepared by Ephraim Borowski of Hertford College, Oxford, incorp- 
orates some promising lines of attack on a number of these 
problems.
