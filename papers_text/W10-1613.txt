Abstract 
Linguistic resources with domain-specific 
coverage are crucial for the development of 
concrete Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
systems. In this paper we give a global intro-
duction to the ongoing (since 2009) TermiNet 
project, whose aims are to instantiate a gener-
ic NLP methodology for the development of 
terminological wordnets and to apply the in-
stantiated methodology for building a termi-
nological wordnet in Brazilian Portuguese. 
1 Introduction 
In knowledge-based Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) systems, the lexical knowledge database is 
responsible for providing, to the processing mod-
ules, the lexical units of the language and their 
morphological, syntactic, semantic-conceptual and 
even illocutionary properties (Hanks, 2004). 
In this scenario, there is an increasing need of 
accurate general lexical-conceptual resources for 
developing NLP applications. 
A revolutionary development of the 1990s was 
the Princeton WordNet (WN.Pr) (Fellbaum, 1998), 
an online reference lexical database built for 
North-American English that combines the design 
of a dictionary and a thesaurus with a rich ontolog-
ical potential. 
Specifically, WN.Pr is a semantic network, in 
which the meanings of nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
and adverbs are organized into ?sets of cognitive 
synonyms? (or synsets), each expressing a distinct 
concept. Synsets are interlinked through concep-
tual-semantic (i.e., hypernymy1/hyponymy2, holo-
nymy/meronymy, entailment3, and cause4) and 
lexical (i.e., antonymy) relations. Moreover, 
WN.Pr encodes a co-text sentence for each word-
form in a synset and a concept gloss for each syn-
set (i.e., an informal lexicographic definition of the 
concept evoked by the synset). 
The success of WN.Pr is largely due to its ac-
cessibility, linguistic adequacy and potential in 
terms of NLP. Given that, WN.Pr serves as a mod-
el for similarly conceived wordnets in several lan-
guages. In other words, the success of WN.Pr has 
determined the emergence of several projects that 
aim the construction of wordnets for other lan-
guages than English or to develop multilingual 
wordnets (the most important project in this line is 
EuroWordNet) (Vossen, 2002). 
Many recent projects with the objective of (i) in-
tegrating generic and specialized wordnets (e.g., 
Magnin and Speranza, 2001; Roventini and Mari-
nelli, 2004; Bentivogli et al, 2004), (ii) enriching 
generic wordnets with terminological units (e.g., 
Buitelaar and Sacaleanu, 2002) or (iii) constructing 
terminological wordnets (e.g.: Sagri et al, 2004; 
Smith and Fellbaum, 2004) have shown that con-
                                                        
1 The term Y is a hypernym of the term X if the entity denoted 
by X is a (kind of) entity denoted byY. 
2 If the term Y is a hypernym of the term X then the term X is 
a hyponym of Y. 
3 The action A1 denoted by the verb X entails the action A2 
denoted by the verb Y if A1 cannot be done unless A2 is, or 
has been, done 
4 The action A1 denoted by the verb X causes the action A2 
denoted by the verb Y.

crete NLP application must be able to comprehend 
both expert and non-expert vocabulary. 
Despite the existence of a reasonable number of 
terminological wordnets, there is no a general me-
thodology for building this type of lexical data-
base. Thus, motivated by this gap and by the fact 
that Brazilian Potuguese (PB) is a resource-poor 
language, the two-years TermiNet project has been 
developed since September 2009. 
This paper gives an overview of the TermiNet 
project. Accordingly, in Section 2 we brief de-
scribe the original WN.Pr design that motivated the 
project. In Section 3 we present the aims of the 
TermiNet project and its methodological approach. 
In Section 4 we depict the current state of the 
project. In Section 5 we describe future work, and 
in Section 6 we outline potential points for collabo-
ration with researchers from the rest of the Ameri-
cas. 
2 Princeton WordNet and its Design 
WN.Pr contains information about nouns, verbs, 
adjectives and adverbs in North-American English 
and is organized around the notion of a synset. As 
mentioned, a synset is a set of words with the same 
part-of-speech that can be interchanged in a certain 
context. For example, {car; auto; automobile; ma-
chine; motorcar} form a synset because they can be 
used to refer to the same concept. A synset is often 
further described by a concept gloss5, e.g.: ?4-
wheeled; usually propelled by an internal combus-
tion engine?. 
 Finally, synsets can be related to each other by 
the conceptual-semantic relations of hyperonymy/ 
hyponymy, holonymy/meronymy, entailment and 
cause, and the lexical relation of antonymy. 
 In the example, taken from WN.Pr (2.1), the 
synset {car; auto; automobile; machine; motorcar} 
is related to: 
 
(i) more general concepts or the hyperonym syn-
set: {motor vehicle; automotive vehicle}; 
(ii) more specific concepts or hyponym synsets: 
e.g. {cruiser; squad car; patrol car; police car; 
prowl car} and {cab; taxi; hack; taxicab}; and 
(iii) parts it is composed of: e.g. {bumper}; {car 
door}, {car mirror} and {car window}. 
                                                        
5 An informal lexicographic definition of the concept evoked 
by the synset. 
WN.Pr also includes an English co-text sen-
tence for each word-form in a synset, and a seman-
tic type for each synset. 
Based on WN.Pr design, Brazilian Portuguese 
WordNet (WordNet.Br or WN.Br) project 
launched in 2003 departed from a previous lexical 
resource: the Brazilian Portuguese Thesaurus (Di-
as-da-Silva et al 2002). The original WN.Br data-
base is currently being refined, augmented, and 
upgraded. The improvements include the encoding 
of the following bits of information in to the data-
base: (a) the co-text sentence for each word-form 
in a synset; (b) the concept gloss for each synset; 
and (c) the relevant language-independent hierar-
chical conceptual-semantic relations. 
The current WN.Br database presents the fol-
lowing figures: 11,000 verb forms (4,000 synsets), 
17,000 noun forms (8,000 synsets), 15,000 adjec-
tive forms (6,000 synsets), and 1,000 adverb forms 
(500 synsets), amounting to 44,000 word forms 
and 18,500 synsets (Dias-da-Silva et al 2008). 
3 The TermiNet Project 
The TermiNet (?Terminological WordNet?) 
project started in September 2009 and shall be fi-
nished finish in August 2011. It has been devel-
oped in the laboratory of the Research Group of 
Terminology6 (GETerm) in Federal University of 
S?o Carlos (UFSCar) with the collaboration of the 
Interinstitutional Center for Research and Devel-
opment in Computational Linguistics7 
(NILC/University of S?o Paulo) researchers. 
The TermiNet project has two main objectives. 
The first is to instantiate the generic NLP metho-
dology, proposed by Dias-da-Silva (2006), for de-
veloping terminological databases according to the 
WN.Pr model. Such methodology distinguishes 
itself by conciliating the linguistic and computa-
tional facets of the NLP researches. The second is 
to apply the instantiated methodology to build a 
terminological wordnet or terminet8 in BP, since 
BP is a resource-poor language in NLP for which 
domain-specific databases in wordnet format have 
not been built yet. 
 It is important to emphasize that the main 
terminological resources in BP, which are availa-

7 http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br 
8 In the TermiNet project, a terminological wordnet database 
is called ?terminet?. 
93
ble through the OntoLP9 website, are in fact (for-
mal) ontologies or taxonomies. There is no 
nological WordNet-like database in BP. 
In order to achieve its objectives, TermiNet has, 
apart from the project leader (Prof. Ariani Di Fe-
lippo), an interdisciplinary team that includes six 
undergraduate students: five from Linguistics and 
one from Computer Science courses. The Linguis-
tics students are responsible for specific linguistic 
tasks in the project, such as: (i) corpus compila-
tion, (ii) candidate terms extraction, (iii) synonymy 
identification, and (iv) semantic-conceptual rela-
tions extraction (hypernymy/hyponymy). The res-
ponsability of the Computer Science student is to 
support the automatic processing related to the lin-
guistic (e.g., tagging, parsing, term extraction, 
etc.) and linguistic-computational domains during 
the initial stages of the project. 
Moreover, the project counts with the collabora-
tion of four PhD researchers from NILC. Specifi-
cally, TermiNet has the support of Prof. Gladis 
Maria de Barcellos Almeida, a specialist in termi-
nological research and the coordinator of GETerm; 
Prof. Maria da Gra?as Volpe Nunes, the coordina-
tor of NILC and one of the most important Brazili-
an NLP researchers; Prof. Sandra Aluisio, a 
specialist in corpus construction, and Prof. Thiago 
Pardo, who has interests in the development of lex-
ical resources for the automatic processing of BP. 
3.1 Instantiation of the NLP Tree-Domain 
Methodology 
Based on Expert Systems development, Dias-da-
Silva (2006) established a three-domain approach 
methodology to develop any research in NLP do-
main, assuming a compromise between Human 
Language Technology and Linguistics (Dias-da-
Silva, 1998). 
 The linguistic-related information to be compu-
tationally modeled is likened to a rare metal. So, it 
must be "mined", "molded", and "assembled" into 
a computer-tractable system (Durkin, 1994). Ac-
cordingly, the processes of designing and imple-
menting a terminet lexical database have to be 
developed in the following complementary do-
mains: the linguistic domain, the linguistic-
computational domain, and implementational or 
computational domain.

(a) The Linguistic-related Domain 
In this domain, the lexical resources and the lexi-
cal-conceptual knowledge are mined. More specif-
ically, the research activities in the linguistic 
domain are divided in two processes: the selection 
of the lexical resources for building the terminet 
database, and the specification of the lexical-
conceptual knowledge that characterize a terminet. 
 The linguist starts off these procedures by deli-
mitating the specialized domain that will be en-
coded in wordnet format. 
 According to Almeida and Correia (2008), deal-
ing with an entire specialized domain is a very 
problematic task because the domains (e.g.: Mate-
rials Engineering) in general are composed of sub-
domains (e.g.: Ceramic Materials, Polymers and 
Metals) with different characteristics, generating a 
large universe of sources from which the lexical-
conceptual knowledge will have to be mined. 
 Consequently, the authors present some criteria 
that may lead to delimitate a specialized domain: 
(i) the interest of the domain experts by termino-
logical products (in this case, by a terminet); (ii) 
the relevance of the domain in the educational, so-
cial, political, economic, scientific and/or technol-
ogical scenarios, and (iii) the availability of 
specialized resources in digital format from which 
the lexical-conceptual knowledge will be extracted. 
After delimitating the domain, it is necessary to 
select the lexical resources describe in (iii). Ac-
cording to Rigau (1998), the two main sources of 
information for building wide-coverage lexicons 
for NLP systems are: structured resources (e.g.: 
conventional monolingual and bilingual dictiona-
ries, thesauri, taxonomies, vocabularies, etc.) and 
unstructured resources (i.e., corpora10). 
 Due to the unavailability of reusing structured 
resources, the corpora have become the main 
source of lexical knowledge (Nascimento, 2003; 
Agbago and Barri?re, 2005; Cabr? et al, 2005; 
Almeida, 2006). The increasing use of corpora in 
terminological researches is also due to the fact 
that ?el car?cter de t?rmino no se da per se, sino en 
funci?n del uso de una unidad l?xica en un contex-
to expresivo y situacional determinado? (Cabr?, 
1999: 124). Thus, in the TermiNet project, the cor-
                                                        
10 ?A corpus is a collection of pieces of language text in elec-
tronic form, selected according to external criteria to 
represent, as far as possible, a language or language variety as 
a source of data for linguistic research? (Sinclair, 2005). 
94
pus is considered the main lexical resource that can 
be used to construct a terminet. 
 Although there are available several specialized 
corpora, the development of a terminet of certain 
domains may require the compilation of a corpus. 
 Based on the assumptions of Corpus Linguistics 
(Aluisio and Alemida, 2007), the construction of a 
corpus must follow three steps: (i) the corpus pro-
jection, i.e., the specification of the corpus typolo-
gy according to the research purposes; (ii) the 
compilation of the texts that will compose the cor-
pus, and (iii) the pre-processing of the corpus (i.e., 
conversion, clean-up, manipulation, and annotation 
of the texts).  
 From the corpus, the specialized knowledge will 
be extracted, i.e., the terminological units (or 
terms), the lexical relations, and the conceptual-
semantic relations11. 
 As mentioned in previous sections, the lexical 
units are organized into four syntactic categories in 
WN.Pr: verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. Giv-
en the relevance of nouns in the organization of 
any terminology (i.e., the set of all terms related to 
a given subject field or discipline), we decided to 
restrict the construction of a terminet to the catego-
ry of nouns. In other words, a terminet database, in 
principle, will only contain information about con-
cepts lexicalized by nouns. Additionally, it will 
only encode the hyperonymy/hyponymy relations, 
which are the most important conceptual-semantic 
relations between nouns. The co-text sentence for 
each word-form in a synset and the concept gloss 
for each synset will not be focused in building a 
terminet. 
 As the TermiNet a corpus-based project, we will 
apply approaches and strategies to automatically 
recognize and extract candidate terms and relations 
from corpus. 
 In order to better understand the automatic can-
didate terms and extraction, it can be useful to 
identify two mainstream approaches to the prob-
lem. In the first approach, statistical measures have 
been proposed to define the degree of termhood of 
candidate terms, i.e., to find appropriate measures 
that can help in selecting good terms from a list of 
candidates. In the second approach, computational 
terminologists have tried to define, identify and 
recognize terms looking at pure linguistic proper-
                                                        
11 The glosses and co-text sentences will not be specificied in 
the TermiNet projet. 
ties, using linguistic filtering techniques aiming to 
identify specific syntactic term patterns (Bernhard, 
2006; Pazienza et al, 2005; Cabr? et al, 2001). 
 Once extrated, the candidate terms have be vali-
dated. Two validation estrategies will be consi-
dered in the TermiNet project. The first strategy 
consists on manually validating by domain experts. 
The second consists on automatically comparing 
the list of candidate terms with a list of lexical un-
ities extracted from a general corpus in BP. 
 The automatic acquisition of hyper-
onym/hyponymy relation from corpus is common-
ly based on linguistic methods. These methods 
look for linguistic clues that indisputably indicate 
the relation of interest (Hearst, 1992). The linguis-
tic clues are basically lexico-syntactic patters such 
as: [NP such {NP,}*{(or|and)} NP] (e.g., ?works 
by such authors as Herrick, and Shakespeare?). 
The hierarchical relations extrated from corpus are 
commonly validated by domain experts. 
 
(b) The Linguistic-Computational Domain 
In this domain, the overall information selected 
and organized in the preceding domain is molded 
into a computer-tractable representation; in the 
case of a WordNet-like database, the computer-
tractable representation is based on the notions of: 
 word form ? a orthographic representation of an 
individual word or a string of individual words 
joined with underscore characters; 
 synset ? a set of words built on the basis of the 
notion of synonymy in context, i.e. word inter-
changeability in some context; 
 lexical matrix ? associations of sets of word 
forms and the concepts they lexicalize; 
 relational pointers ? formal representations of 
the relations between the word forms in a syn-
set and other synsets; synonymy of word forms 
is implicit by inclusion in the same synset; 
hyperonymy always relates one synset to 
another, and is an example of a semantic rela-
tion; hyperonymy, in particular, is represented 
by reflexive pointers (i.e., if a synset contains a 
pointer to another synset, the other synset 
should contain a corresponding reflexive poin-
ter back to the original synset). 
 
(c) The Computational Domain 
In this domain, the computer-tractable representa-
tions are assembled by utilities (i.e., a computa-
tional tool to create and edit lexical knowledge). In 
95
other words, it is generated, in this domain, the 
terminet database. The software tool that we will 
use to generate the terminet database is under in-
vestigation. 
4 TermiNet: Past and Current Stages of 
Development 
The project, which started in September 2009, is 
still in its early stages. Consequently, the research 
tasks that have been developed so far are those re-
lated to the linguistic domain. As described in Sec-
tion 3.1a, there are several linguistic tasks in the 
TermiNet project. Two of them ? the delimitation 
of the specialized domain and the corpus projec-
tion ? are completed. In subsections 4.1 and 4.2, 
we present these finished processes and in 4.3 we 
focus on the current activity. 
4.1 Delimitation of the specialized domain 
DE is conventionally defined as "any educational 
or learning process or system in which the teacher 
or instructor is separated geographically or in 
time from his or her students or educational re-
sources?. 
 According to the second Brazilian Yearbook of 
Statistics on Open and Distance Education 
(Anu?rio Brasileiro Estat?stico de Educa??o Aberta 
e a Dist?ncia12), in 2007 there were approximately 
2,5 millions of students enrolled in accredited DE 
courses, from basic to graduate education, in 257 
accredited institutions. The number of students in 
DE courses has grown 24.9% in relation to 2006. 
Thus, we can see the relevance of the DE modality 
in Brazil. Despite the relevance of the DE in the 
Brazilian educational (and political) scenario, there 
is no a lexical-conceptual representation of this 
domain, especially in a machine-readable format. 
 Consequently, the instantiated methodology will 
be validated by building DE.WordNet (DE.WN), a 
specialized wordnet of the Distance Education (or 
Distance Learning) domain in BP. The construc-
tion of such database has been supported by do-
main experts from the ?Open University of Brazil? 
(Universidade Aberta do Brasil ? UAB) project of 
the Federal University of S?o Carlos (UFSCar). 
 DE.WN can be integrated into the wordnet lexi-
cal database for BP, the WordNet.Br (Dias-da-
                                                        
12 http://www.abraead.com.br/anuario/anuario_2008.pdf 
Silva et al, 2008), enriching it with domain specif-
ic knowledge. 
4.2 Corpus projection 
Following the assumptions of Corpus Linguistics 
described in Section 3, the corpus of DE domain 
has been constructed according to the steps: (i) 
corpus projection, (ii) corpus compilation, and (iii) 
the pre-processing of the texts. 
 The corpus typology in the TermiNet project 
was specified based on: (i) the conception of ?cor-
pus?, (ii) the type of lexical resource to be built, 
and (iii) the project decisions (Di Felippo and Sou-
za, 2009). 
 The corpus definition or conception is common-
ly related to three criteria: representativeness, bal-
ance and authenticity. 
 According to the representativeness criterion, 
we have been compiled a representative corpus of 
the DE domain. There have been many attempts to 
set the size, or at least establish a minimum num-
ber of texts, from which a specialized corpus may 
be compiled. To satisfy the representativeness cri-
terion, we have been constructed a medium-large 
corpus, with at least 1 million of words. 
 In a specialized corpus, it is important to gather 
texts from different genres (i.e. technical-scientific, 
scientific divulgation, instructional, informative, 
and technical-administrative) and media (i.e, 
newswire, books, periodicals, etc.). Following the 
balance and authenticity criteria, we have been 
constructed a corpus with a balanced number of 
real texts per genre. 
 Besides, the format of the lexical database (i.e. a 
terminet) determined some characteristics of the 
corpus. Specifically, the corpus has to be syn-
chronic/ contemporary, since a wordnet (termino-
logical or not) encodes synchronic lexical-
conceptual knowledge. The corpus has only to 
store written texts, since wordnets are lingwares 
for written language processing. Finally, the cor-
pus in the TermiNet project has only to store texts 
from a specialized domain and in one language. 
Additionally, some project decisions deter-
mined other characteristics of the corpus. Two ini-
tial decisions in the project were: (i) to apply semi-
automatic methods of lexical-conceptual know-
ledge extraction, and (ii) to share the resources and 
results of the TermiNet project with Computational 
Linguistics community. As a consequency of the 
project decision described in (i), the corpus will be 
96
annotated with part-of-speech (PoS) information, 
since some automatic extraction methods require 
it. As a consequency of the decision presented in 
(ii), the corpus will be available and usable as 
widely as possible on the web. 
Finally, we also decided that once the corpus 
has been assembled, it will not be changed until the 
first version of DE.WN is ready. 
 Based on the typology proposed by Giouli and 
Peperidis (2002), the Table 1 summarizes the cha-
racteritics of the corpus previously described.

The specialized domain and corpus typology were 
specified by the undergraduate student responsible 
for the corpus compilation under the supervision of 
a PhD in Linguistics (leader of the project). 
4.3 Corpus compilation 
Currently, one undergraduate student from Lin-
guistics has been compiled the corpus. Specifical-
ly, the corpus compilation comprises two 
processes: (i) the selection of resources and (ii) the 
collect of texts from these resources. 
 In the TermiNet project, the web is the main 
source for collecting texts of DE. The choice of 
web reflects the fact that web has become an un-
precedented and virtually inexhaustible source of 
authentic natural language data for researchers in 
linguistics. 
 Although there are many computational tools 
that assist in gathering a considerable amount of 
texts on the web, the selection/collection of texts 
has been followed a manual process, which is 
composed of three steps: (i) to access a webpage 
whose content is important for compiling the cor-
pus, (ii) to search the texts on the webpage by 
search queries as ?distance education? and ?dis-
tance learning?, and (iii) to save the text files on 
the computer. 
In the pre-processing step, the text files in a non-
machine readable format (e.g. pdf) are manually 
converted to text format (txt), which is readable by 
machines. This process is important because the 
lexical-conceptual knowledge will be 
(semi)automatically extracted from the corpus, and 
the extraction tools require a corpus whose texts 
are in txt format. 
Data corrupted by the conversion or even unne-
cessary to the research (e.g. references, informa-
tion about filliation, etc.) are excluded during the 
cleaning process. After that, the metadata or exter-
nal information (e.g. authorship, publication de-
tails, genre and text type, etc.) on each text are 
being automatically annotated and encoded in a 
header. In the TermiNet project, we are using the 
header editor available at the ?Portal de Corpus? 
website13. 
5 Future Work 
According to the three-domain methodology, fu-
ture steps will involve the following tasks of the 
linguistic domain: candidate terms and relations 
extraction (and validation). 
 In the TermiNet project, two specific software 
tools constructed based on lingustic approaches 
will be used to extract candidate terms from the 
DE corpus: EXATOLP (Lopes et al, 2009) and On-
toLP (Ribeiro Jr., 2008). Additionally, we intend to 
extract the terms from corpus using the NSP 
(Ngram Statistics Package) tool (Bannerjee and 
Pedersen, 2003), i.e., a flexible and easy-to-use 
software tool that supports the identification and 
analysis of Ngrams. 
 To extract the hyperonymy and hyponymy rela-
tions, we will also use the OntoLP, which is a tool, 
actually a plug-in, for the ontologies editor 
Prot?g?14, a widely used editor in the scientific 
community and which gives support to the con-
struction of ontologies. The process of automatic 
                                                        
13 http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br:8180/portal/ 
14 http://protege.stanford.edu/ 
97
ontology construction in the OntoLP tool also en-
globes the identification of hierarchical relation 
between the terms. 
 The synonymy relation will be also recognized 
and extracted automatically from the corpus. How-
ever, the automatic extraction method of such lexi-
cal relation is still under investigation. 
After the acquisition of all lexical-conceptual 
information, we will develop the tasks or processes 
of the linguistic-computational and computational 
domains. 
 Among the expected results of the TermiNet 
projet are: (i) a methodological framework for 
building a specific type of lingware, i.e. termino-
logical wordnets; (ii) a specialized corpus of the 
DE domain; (iii) a terminological lexical database 
based on the WN.Pr format of the DE domain. 
Moreover, there is the possibility of extending the 
WN.Br database through the inclusion of specia-
lized knowledge. 
Besides the benefits to NLP domain, the 
DE.WN may also contribute to the development of 
standard terminographic products (e.g., glossary, 
dictionary, vocabulary, etc.), of the DE domain 
since the organization of the lexical-conceptual 
knowledge is an essential step in building such 
products. 
6 Collaborative Opportunities 
We consider our experience in developing a termi-
net in BP as the major contribution that we can 
offer to other researchers in Latin America. Since 
the resources (i.e., corpus and lexical database) and 
tools (i.e., terms and relations extractors) that we 
have been used are language-dependent, they can-
not be used directly for Spanish and English. But, 
we are willing to share our expertise on (i) compil-
ing a terminological corpus, (ii) automatically ex-
tracting lexical-conceptual knowledge from 
corpus, and (iii) constructing a terminet database in 
order to develop similar projects for Spanish and 
English. 
 We are really interested in actively taking part in 
joint research projects that aim to construct termi-
nological lexical database for Spanish or English, 
especially in wordnet format. 
 Collaboration of researchers from the USA that 
were directly involved in the development of 
wordnet databases (terminological or not), willing 
to share their experience and tools, would be wel-
come. 
 We would appreciate collaboration from re-
searchers in the USA specifically in relation to 
computational programs or software tools used in 
building WordNet-like lexical database, which are 
responsible for the computer-tractable representa-
tion described in 3.1(b). The current WN.Br edit-
ing tool, which was originally designed to aid the 
linguist in carrying out the tasks of building syn-
sets, selecting co-text sentences from corpora, and 
writing synset concept glosses, has been modified 
to aid the linguistic in carrying out the task of en-
coding conceptual relations. However, this editor is 
just able to deal with the hypernymy/hyponymy 
relations when they are inherited from WN.Pr 
through a conceptual-semantic alignment strategy 
(Dias-da-Silva et al 2008). So, the WN.Br editor is 
not the most appropriate tool to TermiNer project 
tasks. Consequently, contributions to develop ?a 
kind of? Grinder15 for TermiNet would be wel-
come. We would also appreciate collaboration 
from re-searchers in the USA in relation to metho-
dological approaches to enriching generic word-
nets with terminological units.

Lexicographers make their additions and changes in the lexi-
cal source files, and the Grinder takes those files and converts 
them into a lexical database (in wordnet format).
