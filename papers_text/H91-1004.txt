The Department of Speech Communication and Music 
Acoustics of The Royal Institute of Technology is a three- 
professor  department  with chairs in: Speech 
Communication, Music Acoustics, and Hearing Technology. 
The activities within the department are multi-disciplinary 
with a concentration on research. 
The speech communication group is the biggest within 
the department with more than 20 researchers. The work 
covers a wide variety of topics, ranging from detailed 
theoretical developments of speech production models 
through phonetic analyses to practical applications of 
speech technology. 
Contacts with other research institutions in Sweden and 
internationally are well developed. Of major importance in 
this respect is the scientific journal, the STL-QPSR (Speech 
Transmission Laboratory, Quarterly Progress and Status 
Report) which is published three or four times a year in 1000 
copies distributed to 45 countries. 
The department is engaged in European cooperation 
within the COST-project on speech synthesis and 
recognition, and has also been invited to the European 
Community project on Blindness and Technology. Together 
with the Swedish Telecom, we are engaged in the SAM 
project (Speech Assessment Methods) in the second phase of 
ESPRIT. The Swedish Teleeom is an important industrial 
contact for the department. Close technical and scientific 
contacts exist with Infovox AB which markets multi-lingual 
text-to-speech and also recognition products based on our 
research and development. 
For many years we have been engaged in studying 
speaker characteristics both from an analytical point of view 
and in modelling different speaker and speaking styles. A 
speech database is under development in which realizations 
of segmental and prosodic structures are investigated. 
Variation in coarticulation strategies, reductions and 
elaborations along the hypo/hyper speech dimension will be 
studied in context on this database. Studies of positional 
variants of sonorants and duration models have already been 
carried out. 
The text-to-speech project \[8\] has recently focused on 
improved prosodic models and new strategies for segmental 
synthesis. A new synthesis model has been developed which 
includes a new model of the voice source. It will increase the 
possibilities of modelling different speaker characteristics 
and speaking styles. Methods in the speech recognition 
project have been influenced by this work. As a consequence 
the two projects are, in some respect, merging. This has 
made our speech recognition efforts slightly different from 
the general trend. 
We now emphasize the research on knowledge-based 
recognition for large vocabularies. The research program 
"Nebula" \[4,5\], includes, for example, speech analysis based 
on auditory models, feature extraction in a parallel network 
\[9\], and prediction models based on speech synthesis 
\[1,2,3\]. 
A major effort at the department has been to study voice 
source characteristics \[6\]. The voice source has pronounced 
effects on the overall shape of the speech spectrum. Intra- 
speaker voice source variation can cause severe spectral 
distortion and contributes to recognition errors in current 
speaker-independent as well as in speaker-dependent 
recognition systems. The high frequency region of the 
speech spectrum can vary by 20-30 dB relative to the low- 
frequency region for a single speaker and still more between 
among speakers. The voice source carries mainly non- 
segmental information (apart from the voiced/unvoiced 
distinction). The prosodic information carried by the voice 
source is important and should not be discarded. This 
information is lost in many of the current echniques using 
parameter estimation methods intended to be insensitive to 
voice source behavior. Since the voice characteristics are 
changing during an utterance, the adaptation should be part 
of the recognition process itself. The speed of the 
adaptation should be faster than in normal acoustic 
adaptation. Modelling the source of variation rather than 
the effect on the speech acoustics potentially makes fast 
adaptation possible. 
As more explicit knowledge on speech production is 
collected and formulated, it is of interest to explore the use of 
such information in speech recognition research. A 
description of speech on a level closer to articulation, rather 
than the acoustic base that is used in present-day speech 
recognition will make generalization to different speakers 
easier. The production component in the form of a speech 
synthesis ystem will ideally make the collection of training 
data unnecessary. During the last year, special projects 
studying speaker-independent recognition based on stored 
phoneme prototypes have been undertaken \[3\]. In these 
experiments, the references are generated during the 
recognition process itself. Thus, it is possible to 
dynamically take into account word juncture and word 
position effects. The synthetic references can be modified to 
match the voice of the current speaker. The experiments 
have shown promising results, see Table 1.

recognition test. Our text-to-speech system was used as 
a base-line in b) and human speakers in a). 
Artificial neural networks have also been explored as part 
of a recognition system \[9\]. We know from linguistic 
research that phonetic features are a powerful tool to separate 
phones from each other. A special network was trained to 
recognize anumber of features. The features were recognized 
with 80% to 95% accuracy. The features were combined with 
the original spectrum as input to a phone recognizer. The 
work will be continued with a dynamic assignment of feature 
strengths. 
Most of the speech technology application studies are 
now made outside the department. Some recent hesis work 
has, however, been devoted to this, e.g., speech recognition 
for air traffic controllers and speech synthesis in the process 
industry. Speech recognition has also been used in a system 
for environment control for persons with severe mobility 
impairments. Speech recognition for mobile telephony has 
been developed in cooperation with Infovox and Ericsson. 
The noisy environment in the car has called for several 
modifications to the original algorithms.

The work is supported bythe Swedish Board for Technical 
Development. I would also like to thank the organizing 
committee for inviting foreign guests to participate in this 
interesting workshop.
