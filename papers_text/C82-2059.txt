There are. already a variety of Chinese Language Processing 
Systems commercially available around the world, of which the 
main d ivergence  i s  probably  in  the input  approaches of  Chinese 
characters .  But due to  the fo l low ing  two fac ts  none of the 
cur rent  approaches could be taken fo r  an un iversa l ly  acknowledg- 
ed scheme, the f i r s t  fac t  i s  that  the to ta l  number of  Chinese 
characters  i s  immense and the second and perhaps more c r i t i ca l  
fac t  i s  the topo log ica l  s t ruc tures  of  Chinese characters  are  
ra ther  soph is t i ca ted .  
Cons ider ing  that  Chinese Phonet ic  Alphabet (CPA) i s  ga in -  
ing on Chinese pup i l s  and s tudents  ( inc lud ing  fo re ign  s tudents  
s tudy ing  in  Chins)e Cons ider ing  a l so  that  CPA i s  supposed to be 
used as an in ternat iona l  t ranscr ip t ion  fo r  Chinese characters ,  
the author  has proposed a new input  approach to input  Chinese 
language to a computer in  the l ight  of AI theory  and pract i ce  
with i t s  p ro to type  Jus t  be ing implement on a microcomputer  
system in our laboratories. This new Chinese Input System will 
sex~e as one of the subsystems of a comprehensive Chinese 
Language Computer-Aided Instruction System for teaching foreign 
s tudents  oh ot~ campus - the HUAHAN system. 
Working with our Chinese Input  System people can input  
Chinese text  by typ ing  the cor respond ing  phonet ic  symbols of  
each Chinese word through an ord inary  keyboard.  Eventua l ly  the 
original Chlnes% text will be obtained on the Chinese ORT screen 
or on the harcopy through Chinese pr in ter .

The bot t leneck  of th i s  kind of approaches i s  genera l ly  
a t t r ibuted  to the la rge  and in reasonab le  amount of homophones 
in Chinese language. As a matter of fact, a siDgle Chinese 
word may consist of more than one characters. In CPA a multi- 
-character word i s  o f ten  represented  as one un i t .  For ins tance ,  
in phonetic system the string "xingshi" is a word which ks 
formed out of two Chinese characters ,  i . e .  the character  
"zing" and the character  "shi". Some individual Chinese charact -  
e rs ,  such as "xing" and "shi", may also be a word, hence they 
may have one or more homophones. Furthermore,  mu l t i - character  
word i8 s t i l l  sub jec t  to homophone, i .e .  phonet ic  symbol 
"x ingsh i "  represents  both the Chinese words "s i tuat ion"  and 
" form",  among others ,  though the number of homophones i s  much 
reduced.  
The key to the quest ion  ks the sof tware  of th i s  Chinese 
Input System which must be developed as to ident i fy  d i f fe rent  
Chinese words proper ly  on the bas is  of the same phonet ic  
s~mbol, i . e . ,  d i f fe rent  s t r ing  of Chinese oharacters  must be 
generated  from the same phonet ic  symbol occur ing  in  d i f fe rent  
contexts .  
We argue that  the d i f fe rent ia t ion  of  the homophones could  
be rea l i zed  in  the s imi la r  as in  the d i ssmblguat ion  of  the same 
word occur ing in  d i f fe rent  contexts  in  Natura l  Language Under- 
standing (NLU) which is making rapid progress. 
When considered as without any connection with other words 
a Chinese word with one or more homophones sharing the same 
phonet ic  symbol i s  rea l ly  a t roub le ,  but when we t ry  to  grasp 
the proper  word not mere ly  by i t se l f  but in  connect ion  w i th  
i t s  context  wi th the background knowledgy and/or  wi th  the very  
top ics  of  the whole text  or cor respond ing  paragraph,  we f ind ,  
as a ru le ,  the phonet ic  ambigui ty  ( i .e .  the d i f fe rent  homophones 
which cause language ambigu i t ies )  would d i sso lve .  So the most 
important i s  to  ext rac t  the above-mentioned l ingu is t i c  concept -  
uat ions  as Chinese text  input  i s  going on.

To th i s  end our  sys tem i s  d iv ided  in to  four  subsystems 
including the following= 
Lex ica l  ana lyzer  
Context  ana lyzer  
In fe rence  mechan ism 
Knowledge/concept / top ic  base 
The lex ica l  ana lyzer  separates  the  words  wh ich  have  one 
or  more mohophones  f rom those  w i thout  homophones .  
The context  ana lyzer  t r ies  to  ext rac t  the  contextua l  
mean ing  and/or  the  top ic  o f  the  text  o r  the  paragraph where in  
the  word occurs  by ana lyz ing  the  context .  
The in ference  mechan ism draws ,  when necessary ,  in fe rences  
f rom the  contextua l  mean ing  in  o rder  to  obta in  proper  concept  
o f  the  t roub lesome phonet ic  symbo ls  so as  to  get  the  proper  
Chinese words  consequent ly .  
The knowledge/coD~ept / top ie  base  per fo rms as  a dr iver  fo r  
the  who le  sys tem,  by communicat ing  w i th  each  o f  the  o ther  
three subsystems in gathering processed results from one sub- 
sys tem as  input  data  to  the  o ther  and prov id ing  them wi th  
additional material necessary for further pocessing. 
Thus people can easily see that what our system really 
does is essentially a Chinese Language Understandin E System 
tries to do. But what our system features as compared with 
other  NLU sys tems i s  that  we t r ied  hard  to  deve lop  i t  to  make 
sure  that  the  knowledge/concept / top ic  base  and the  three  o ther  
subsystems operate  concur rent ly ,  re f lec t ing  our  not ion  o f  the  
actual process of human language understanding. 
Conventionally Chinese Language Processing is involved in 
the area of Computer Science. In working up our system we 
have benefited a lot from theories and practices in Computat- 
ional Linguistics and advanced researches in AI, especially 
those research activities at University of Pennsylvania (under 
direction of Prof. A.K.Joshi) and at Yale University (under 
direction of Prof. R.C.Schank), all of which bear a strong 
linguistic flavor.

As a resu l t ,  the author  i s  inc l ined  to s~est  a new 
in terd isc ip l inary  research  f ie ld  be put forward which i s  
tentat ive ly  termed as L ingu is t i c  Eng ineer ing .  O-ur work i s  
taken as a humble s ta r t  of  i t s  p rac t i ce .  
Now the implementat ion  of  the system i s  Jumt going on 
w i th  a pro to type .  To our spec ia l  purpose the BASIC d ia lec ts  
of  our CROW~I~CO and CBSEC microcomputers are  extended by the 
author  in  o rder  to  invo lve  some LISP features  which would 
meet the needs to implement such a heavy l ingu is t i c  system 
on a microcomputer .
