PROJECT GOALS 
SKI's consistency modeling project beg~ in 
August 1992, The goal of the project is to develop 
consistency modeling technology. That is, we aim to reduce 
the number of improper independence assumptions used in 
traditional speech recognition algorithms so that the 
resulting speech recognition hypotheses are more self- 
consistent and, therefore, more accurate. Consistency is
achieved by conditioning HMM output distributions on 
state and observations histories, P(x\[s,H). The goal of the 
project is finding the proper form of the probability 
distribution P, the proper history vector, H, and the proper 
feature vector, x, and developing the infrastructure ( .g. 
efficient estimation and search techniques) o that 
consistency modeling can be effectively used. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Highlights of our accomplishments to date include a large 
reduction in our speech recognition error rate due to the 
development on Genonic HMM technology, and the 
development of a real-time version of our system. A 
summary of our accomplishments include: 
? SKI developed and refined Genonlc HMM 
technology. This is a form of continuous density 
I-IMM that, combined with other advances, allowed 
us to reduce our error rate by over a factor of two 
over the past year. Currently our best performance is 
9.3% word error as measured on ARPA's 20K Nov. 
1992 evaluation set and 13.6% on ARPA's 20K Nov. 
1993 test set, both using ARPA's standard grammars. 
? SRI developed an information-theoretic framework 
for estimating the effect of the history H in the 
conditional HMM output distribution P(x/s,H) when 
H is constrained tobe a previous frames xt_ i. 
? SRI implemented a version of continuous local- 
consistency modeling. SRI verified that the 
information-theoretic framework above indeed 
predicts recognition accuracy improvements. We 
473 
measured performance ofcontinuous local 
consistency for several different frame lags. 
? SKI developed progressive s arch: a framework for 
using hierarchies of recognition algorithm~ ill order 
to achieve fast yet accurate speech recognition. 
? SKI developed tree-based search schemes for 
implementing large-vocabulary speech recognition 
systems. This resulted in a real-time 20,000 
recognition system with about 30% word error. 
? SKI developed Gaussian shortlist echnology and 
other techniques for avoiding Gaussian distribution 
evaluation. This resulted in a net deecrease of 
Ganssian evaluations by a factor of 30 with no 
recognition accuracy degradation. By combining 
this with the above search technologies, we expect 
implement a real-time near full-accuracy speech 
recognition i  the near future. 
? SKI tran~erred, improved, and evaluated feature 
mapping technology developed on NSF funding. 
This allows our system to be virtually microphone 
independent for large classes of microphones. For 
instnnce, using models developed for a Sennheiser 
close-talking microphone, accuracy degraded only 
10% (5.9% to 6.4% error) when tested on data 
recorded with an Audio Technica desk-mounted 
microphone. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Our plans for the coming year include: 
? Advancing the state of our Genonlc ttMM 
technology, including inCOlporating segmental 
features to improve the consistency ofhypotheses. 
? Implementing real-time near full accuracy I-IMM 
systems by combining tree-search, multi-pass and 
shortlist echnology. 
? Further improving and evaluating feature-mapping 
microphone-independent HMM technology.
