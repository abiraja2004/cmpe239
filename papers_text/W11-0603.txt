Abstract
Learning to group words into phrases with-
out supervision is a hard task for NLP sys-
tems, but infants routinely accomplish it. We
hypothesize that infants use acoustic cues to
prosody, which NLP systems typically ignore.
To evaluate the utility of prosodic information
for phrase discovery, we present an HMM-
based unsupervised chunker that learns from
only transcribed words and raw acoustic cor-
relates to prosody. Unlike previous work on
unsupervised parsing and chunking, we use
neither gold standard part-of-speech tags nor
punctuation in the input. Evaluated on the
Switchboard corpus, our model outperforms
several baselines that exploit either lexical or
prosodic information alone, and, despite pro-
ducing a flat structure, performs competitively
with a state-of-the-art unsupervised lexical-
ized parser, with a substantial advantage in
precision. Our results support the hypothesis
that acoustic-prosodic cues provide useful ev-
idence about syntactic phrases for language-
learning infants.
1 Introduction
Young children routinely learn to group words into
phrases, yet computational methods have so far
struggled to accomplish this task without supervi-
sion. Previous work on unsupervised grammar in-
duction has made progress by exploiting information
such as gold-standard part of speech tags (e.g. Klein
and Manning (2004)) or punctuation (e.g. Seginer
(2007)). While this information may be available
in some NLP contexts, our focus here is on the com-
putational problem facing language-learning infants,
who do not have access to either part of speech
tags or punctuation. However, infants do have ac-
cess to certain cues that have not been well explored
by NLP researchers focused on grammar induction
from text. In particular, we consider the cues to syn-
tactic structure that might be available from prosody
(roughly, the structure of speech conveyed through
rhythm and intonation) and its acoustic realization.
The idea that prosody provides important ini-
tial cues for grammar acquisition is known as the
prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis, and is well-
established in the field of language acquisition
(Gleitman and Wanner, 1982). Experimental work
has provided strong support for this hypothesis, for
example by showing that infants begin learning ba-
sic rhythmic properties of their language prenatally
(Mehler et al, 1988) and that 9-month-olds use
prosodic cues to distinguish verb phrases from non-
constituents (Soderstrom et al, 2003). However, as
far as we know, there has so far been no direct com-
putational evaluation of the prosodic bootstrapping
hypothesis. In this paper, we provide the first such
evaluation by exploring the utility of acoustic cues
for unsupervised syntactic chunking, i.e., grouping
words into non-hierarchical syntactic phrases.
Nearly all previous work on unsupervised gram-
mar induction has focused on learning hierarchical
phrase structure (Lari and Young, 1990; Liang et al,
2007) or dependency structure (Klein and Manning,
2004); we are aware of only one previous paper
on unsupervised syntactic chunking (Ponvert et al,
2010). Ponvert et al describe a simple method for
chunking that uses only bigram counts and punctu-
ation; when the chunks are combined using a right-
branching structure, the resulting trees achieve un-
labeled bracketing precision and recall that is com-
petitive with other unsupervised parsers. The sys-
20
tem?s dependence on punctuation renders it inappro-
priate for addressing the questions we are interested
in here, but its good performance reccommends syn-
tactic chunking as a profitable approach to the prob-
lem of grammar induction, especially since chunks
can be learned using much simpler models than are
needed for hierarchical structure.
The models used in this paper are all variants of
HMMs. Our baseline models are standard HMMs
that learn from either lexical or prosodic observa-
tions only; we also consider three types of models
(including a coupled HMM) that incorporate both
lexical and prosodic observations, but vary the de-
gree to which syntactic and prosodic variables are
tied together in the latent structure of the models.
In addition, we compare the use of hand-annotated
prosodic information (ToBI annotations) to the use
of direct acoustic measures (specifically, duration
measures) as the prosodic observations. All of our
models are unsupervised, receiving no bracketing
information during training.
The results of our experiments strongly support
the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis: we find
that using either ToBI annotations or acoustic mea-
sures in addition to lexical observations (i.e., word
sequences) vastly improves chunking performance
over any source of information alone. Interestingly,
our best results are achieved using a combination
of words and acoustic information as input, rather
than words and ToBI annotations. Our best com-
bined model achieves an F-score of 41% when eval-
uated on the lowest level of syntactic structure in
the Switchboard corpus1, as compared to 25% for
a words-only model and only 3% for an acoustics-
only model. Although the combined model?s score
is still fairly low, additional results suggest that our
corpus of transcribed naturalistic speech is signifi-
cantly more difficult for unsupervised parsing than
the written text that is typically used for training.
Specifically, we find that a state-of the-art unsuper-
vised lexicalized parser, the Common Cover Link
1Since our interest is in child language acquisition, we
would prefer to evaluate our system on data from the CHILDES
database of child-directed speech (MacWhinney, 2000). Unfor-
tunately, there are no corpora in the database that include phrase
structure annotations. We are in the process of annotating a
small evaluation corpus with phrase structure trees, and hope to
use this for evaluation in future work.
(CCL) parser (Seginer, 2007), achieves only 38%
unlabeled bracketing F-score on our corpus, as com-
pared to published results of 76% on WSJ10 (En-
glish) and 59% on Negra10 (German). Interestingly,
we find that when evaluated against full parse trees,
our best chunker achieves an F-score comparable to
that of CCL despite positing only flat structure.
Before describing our models and experiments in
more detail, we first present a brief review of rel-
evant information about prosody and its relation-
ship to syntax, including previous work combining
prosody and syntax in supervised parsing systems.
2 Prosody and syntax
Prosody is a theoretical linguistic concept posit-
ing an abstract organizational structure for speech.2
While it is often closely associated with such mea-
surable phenomena as movement in fundamen-
tal frequency or variation in spectral tilt, these
are merely observable acoustic correlates that pro-
vide evidence of varying quality about the hidden
prosodic structure, which specifies such hidden vari-
ables as contrastive stress or question intonation.
Prosody has been hypothesized to be useful for
learning syntax because it imposes a grouping struc-
ture on word sequences that sometimes coincides
with traditional constituency analyses (Ladd, 1996;
Shattuck-Hufnagel and Turk, 1996). Moreover,
laboratory experiments have shown that adults use
prosody both for syntactic disambiguation (Millotte
et al, 2007; Price et al, 1991) and, crucially, in
learning the syntax of an artificial language (Morgan
et al, 1987). Accordingly, if prosodic structure is
sufficiently prominent in the acoustic signal, and co-
incides often enough with syntactic structure, then it
may provide children with useful information about
how to combine words into phrases.
Although there are several theories of how to rep-
resent and annotate prosodic structure, one of the
most influential is the ToBI (Tones and Break In-
dices) theory (Beckman et al, 2005), which we
will use in some of our experiments. ToBI pro-
poses, among other things, that the prosodic phras-
ing of languages can be represented in terms of se-
quences of break indices indicating the strength of
2Signed languages also exhibit prosodic phenomena, but
they are not addressed here.

word boundaries. In Mainstream American English
ToBI, for example, the boundary between a clitic
and its base word (e.g. ?do? and ?n?t? of ?don?t?)
is 0, representing a very weak boundary, while the
boundary following a word at the end of an intona-
tional phrase is 4, indicating a very strong boundary.
Below we examine how useful these break indices
are for identifying syntactic boundaries.
Finally, we note that our work is not the first com-
putational approach to using prosody for identifying
syntactic structure. However, previous work (Gre-
gory et al, 2004; Kahn et al, 2005; Dreyer and
Shafran, 2007; No?th et al, 2000) has focused on
supervised parsing rather than unsupervised chunk-
ing, and also makes different assumptions about
prosody. For example, Gregory et al (2004) assume
that prosody is an acoustically-realized substitute for
punctuation; our own treatment is much less con-
strained. Kahn et al (2005) and Dreyer and Shafran
(2007) use ToBI labels to represent prosodic infor-
mation, whereas we explore both ToBI and direct
acoustic measures. Finally, No?th et al (2000) do not
use ToBI, instead developing a novel prosodic anno-
tation system designed specifically to provide cues
to syntax and for annotation efficiency. However,
their system is supervised and focuses on improving
parse speed rather than accuracy.
3 Models
Following previous work (e.g. Molina and Pla
(2002) Sha and Pereira (2003)), we formulate
chunking as a tagging task. We use Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) and their variants to perform the
tagging, with carefully specified tags and con-
strained transition distributions to allow us to inter-
pret the results as a bracketing of the input. Specif-
ically, we use four chunk tags: B (?Begin?) and
E (?End?) tags are interpreted as the first and last
words of a chunk, respectively, with I (?Inside?)
corresponding to other words inside a chunk and O
(?Outside?) to all other words. The transition ma-
trices are constrained to afford 0 probability to tran-
sitions that violate these definitions. Additionally,
the initial probabilities are constrained to forbid the
models from starting inside or at the end of a phrase.
We use this four-tag OBIE tagset rather than the
more typical three-tag IOB tagset for two reasons.
First, the OBIE set forces all chunks to be at least
two words long (the shortest chunk allowed is B E).
Imposing this requirement allows us to characterize
the task in concrete terms as ?learning when to group
words together.? Second, as we seek to incorporate
acoustic correlates of prosody into chunking, we ex-
pect edge behavior to merit explicit modeling.3
In the following subsections, we describe the var-
ious models we use. Note that input to all mod-
els is discrete, consisting of words, ToBI annota-
tions, and/or discretized acoustic measures (we de-
scribe these measures and their discretization in Sec-
tion 3.3). See Figure 1 for examples of system input
and output; different models will receive different
combinations of the three kinds of input.
3.1 Baseline Models
Our baseline models are all standard HMMs, with
the graphical structure shown in Figure 2(a). The
first baseline uses lexical information only; the ob-
servation at each time step is the phonetic transcrip-
tion of the current word in the sentence. To han-
dle unseen words at test time, we use an ?UNK.?
token to replace all words in the training and eval-
uation sets that appear less than twice in the train-
ing data. Our second baseline uses prosodic infor-
mation only; the observation at each time step is
the hand-annotated ToBI Break Index for the cur-
rent word, which takes on one of six values: { 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, X, None }.4 Our final baseline uses acous-
tic information only. The observations are one of
six automatically determined clusters in an acoustic
space, as described in Section 3.3.
We trained the HMMs using Baum-Welch, and
used Viterbi for inference.5
3Indeed, when we tried using the IOB tag set in prelimi-
nary experiments, dev-set performance dropped substantially,
supporting this latter intuition.
4The numerical break indices indicate breaks of increas-
ing strength, ?X? represents a break of uncertain strength, and
?None? indicates that the preceding word is outside one of the
fluent prosodic phrases selected for annotation. Additional dis-
tinctions marked by ?-? and ?p? were ignored.
5We actually used the junction tree algorithm from MAL-
LET, which, in the special case of an HMM, reduces to the
Forward-Backward algorithm when using Sum-Product mes-
sages, and to the Viterbi algorithm when using Max-Product
messages. Our extension of MALLET to build junction trees
efficiently for Dynamic Bayes Nets is available online, and is
being prepared for submission to the main MALLET project.

observed, circular nodes are hidden).
3.2 Combined Models
As discussed in Section 2, previous theoretical
and experimental work suggests a combined model
which models uncertainty both between prosody and
acoustics, and between prosody and syntax. To mea-
sure the importance of modeling these kinds of un-
certainty, we will evaluate a series of model struc-
tures that gradually divorce acoustic-prosodic cues
from lexical-syntactic cues.
Our first model is the standard HMM from Fig-
ure 2(a), but generates a (word, acoustics) or (word,
ToBI) pair at each time step. This model has the sim-
plest structure, but includes a separate parameter for
every unique (state, word, acoustics) triple, so may
be too unconstrained to learn anything useful.
To reduce the number of parameters, we pro-
pose a second model that assumes independence be-
tween the acoustic and lexical observations, given
the syntactic state. We call this a ?Two-output HMM
(THMM)? and present its graphical structure in Fig-
ure 2(b). It is straightforward to extend Baum-Welch
to accommodate the extra outputs of the THMM.
Finally, we consider a model that explicitly rep-
resents prosodic structure distinctly from syntactic
structure with a second sequence of tags. We use
a Coupled HMM (CHMM) (Nefian et al, 2002),
which models a set of observation sequences us-
ing a set of hidden variable sequences. Figure 2(c)
presents a two-stream Coupled HMM for three time
steps. The model consists of an initial state proba-
bility distribution pis for each stream s, a transition
matrix as for each stream s conditioning the distri-
bution of stream s at time t + 1 on the state of both
streams at time t, and an emission matrix bs for each
stream conditioning the observation of stream s at
time t on the hidden state of stream s at time t.6
Intuitively, the states emitting acoustic measures
operationalize prosodic structure, and the states
emitting words operationalize syntactic structure.
Crucially, Coupled HMMs impose no a priori cor-
respondence between variables of different streams,
allowing our ?syntactic? states to vary freely from
our ?prosodic? states. As two-stream CHMMs
maintain two emission matrices, two transition ma-

trices, and two initial state distributions, they are
more complex than the other combined models, but
more closely embody intuitions inspired by previous
work on the prosody-syntax interface.
Our Coupled HMMs were also trained using EM.
Marginals for the E-step were computed using the
implementation of the junction tree algorithm avail-
able in MALLET (McCallum, 2002; Sutton, 2006).
During test, the Viterbi tag sequence for each model
is obtained by simply replacing the sum-product
messages with max-product messages.
3.3 Acoustic Cues
As explained in Section 2, prosody is an abstract hid-
den structure which only correlates with observable
features of the acoustic signal, and we seek to select
features which are both easy to measure and likely to
correlate strongly with the hidden prosodic phrasal
structure. While there are many possible cues, we
have chosen to use duration cues. These should pro-
vide good evidence about phrases due to the phe-
nomenon of pre-boundary lengthening (e.g. Beck-
man and Edwards (1990), Wightman et al (1992)),
wherein words, and their final rime, lengthen phrase-
finally. This is likely especially useful for English
due to the lack of confounding segmental duration
contrasts (although variation in duration is unpre-
dictably distributed (Klatt, 1976)), but should be
useful in varying degrees for other languages.
We gather five duration measures:
1. Log total word duration: The annotated word
end time minus the annotated word start time.
2. Log onset duration: The duration from the be-
ginning of the word to the end of the first vowel.
3. Log offset duration: The duration from the be-
ginning of the last vowel to the end of the word.
4. Onset proportion consonant: The duration of
the non-vocalic portion of the word onset di-
vided by the total onset duration.
5. Offset proportion consonant: The duration of
the non-vocalic portion of the word offset di-
vided by the total offset duration.
If a word contains no canonical vowels, then the
first and last sonorants are counted as vocalic. If a

word contains no vowels or sonorants, then the on-
set and offset are the entire word and the propor-
tion consonant for both onset and offset is 1 (this
occurred for 186 words in our corpus).
The potential utility of this acoustic space was
verified by visual inspection of the first few PCA
components, which suggested that the position of a
word in this acoustic space correlated with bracket
count. We discretize the raw (i.e. non-PCA) space
with k-means with six initially random centers for
consistency with the number of ToBI break indices.
4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset
All experiments were performed on part of the Nite
XML Toolkit edition of the Switchboard corpus
(Calhoun et al, 2010). Specifically, we gathered all
conversations which have been annotated for syn-
tax, ToBI, and Mississippi State phonetic alignments
(which lack punctuation).7 The syntactic parses,
word sequences, and ToBI break indices were hand-
annotated by trained linguists, while the Mississippi
State phonetic alignments were automatically pro-
duced by a forced alignment of the speech signal
to a pronunciation-dictionary based phone sequence,
providing an estimate of the beginning and end time
of each phone. A small number of annotation er-
rors (in which the beginning and end times of some
phones had been swapped) were corrected by hand.
This corpus has 74 conversations with two sides
each.
We split this corpus into an 80%/10%/10%
train/dev/test 8 partition by dividing the entire cor-
pus into ten-sentence chunks, assigning the first
eight to the training partition, and the ninth and tenth
to the dev and test partitions, respectively. We then
removed all sentences containing only one or two

errors, e.g. pointing to missing words.

set.
24
words. Sentences this short have a trivial parse, and
are usually formulaic discourse responses (Bell et
al., 2009), which may influence their prosody. The
final corpus statistics are presented in Table 1.
4.2 Evaluation
We use the Penn Treebank parsed version of Switch-
board for evaluation. This version uses a slightly
different tokenization from the Mississippi State
transcriptions that were used as input to the mod-
els, so we transformed the Penn treebank tokeniza-
tion to agree with the Mississippi State tokeniza-
tion (primarily by concatenating clitics to their base
words?i.e. ?do? and ??nt? into ?don?t??and split-
ting multi-word expressions). We also removed all
gold-standard nodes spanning only Trace or PUNC
(recall that the input to the models did not include
punctuation) and collapsed all unary productions.9
In all evaluations, we convert our models? out-
put tag sequence to a set of matched brackets by in-
serting a left bracket preceding each word tagged B
tag and a right bracket following each word tagged
E. This procedure occasionally results in a sentence
with an unmatched opening bracket. If the un-
matched opening bracket is one word from the end
of the sentence, we delete it, otherwise we insert a
closing bracket at the end of the sentence. Figure 1
shows example input sequences together with exam-
ple output tags and their corresponding bracketings.
Previous work on chunking, most notably the
2000 CONLL shared task (Tjong et al, 2000), has
defined gold standard chunks that are useful for find-
ing grammatical relations but which do not corre-
spond to any particular linguistic notion. It is not
clear that such chunks should play a role in lan-
guage acquisition, so instead we evaluate against tra-
ditional syntactic constituents from Penn Treebank-
style parses in two different ways.
Our first evaluation method compares the output
of the chunkers to what Ponvert et al (2010) call
clumps, which are just syntactic constituents that
span only terminals. We created our clump gold-
standard by taking the parse trees resulting from the
preprocessing described above and deleting nodes
that span a non-terminal. Figure 3 presents an ex-
9As we evaluate unlabeled bracketing precision and recall,
the label of the resulting nodes is irrelevant.

ample gold-standard parse tree with the clumps in
boxes. This evaluation avoids penalizing chunkers
for not positing hierarchical structure, but rewards
chunkers only for finding very low-level structure.
In the interest of making no a priori assumptions
about the kinds of phrases our unsupervised method
recovers, we also evaluate our completely flat, non-
recursive chunks directly against the fully recursive
parses in the treebank. To do so, we turn our chun-
ked utterance into a flat tree by simply putting brack-
ets around the entire utterance as in Figure 1(d).
This evaluation penalizes chunkers for never posit-
ing hierarchical structure, but makes no assumptions
about which kinds of phrases ought to be found.
4.3 Models and training
In all, nine HMM models, two versions of the
CCL parser, and a uniform right-branching baseline
were evaluated. Three of the HMMs were standard
HMMs with chunking constraints on the four hidden
states (as described in Section 3.2) that received as
input either words, ToBI break indices, or word du-
ration cluster information, intended as baselines to
illuminate the utility of each information source in
isolation. We also ran two each of Coupled HMM
and Two-output HMM models that received words
in one observed chain and either ToBI break index or
duration cluster in the other observed chain. In the
CHMM models, chunking constraints were enforced
on the chain generating the words, while variables
generating the duration or ToBI information ranged
over four discrete states with no constraints.10 All
non-zero parameters were initialized approximately
uniformly at random,11 and we ran EM until the log
10We also tried imposing chunking constraints on the second
chain, but dev-set performance dropped slightly.
11In preliminary dev-set experiments, different random ini-
tializations performed within two points of each other.

cally for 50-150 iterations.
The CCL parser was trained on the same word se-
quences provided to our models. We also evaluated
the CCL parser as a clumper (CCL Clumper) by re-
moving internal nodes spanning a non-terminal. The
right-branching baseline was generated by inserting
one opening bracket in front of all but the last word,
and closing all brackets at the end of the sentence.
4.4 Results and Discussion
Table 2 presents results for our flat chunkers evalu-
ated against Ponvert et al (2010)-style clumps. Sev-
eral points are apparent. First, all three HMM base-
lines yield very poor results, especially the prosodic
baselines, whose precision and recall are both be-
low 10%. Although the best combined models
still have relatively low performance, it is markedly
higher than either of the individual baselines, and
also higher than the clumps identified by the CCL
parser. Particularly notable is the fact that lexi-
cal and prosodic information appear to be super-
additive in some cases, yielding combined perfor-
mance that is higher than the sum of the individual
scores. Not all combined models work equally well,
however: the poor performance of the HMM com-
bined model supports our initial hypothesis that it is
over parameterized. Interestingly, our acoustic clus-
ters work better than break indices when combined
with words. Finally, we see that the THMM and
CHMM obtain similar performance using words +
acoustics, suggesting that modeling prosodic struc-

ture separately from syntactic structure may be un-
necessary (or that the CHMM does so badly).
To provide further intuition into the kinds of
chunks recovered by the different models, we list
some relevant statistics in Table 3. These statis-
tics show that the models using lexical information
identify at least one chunk in virtually all utterances,
with the better models averaging 2-3 chunks per ut-
terance of around 3 words each. In contrast, the
unlexicalized models find longer chunks (4-5 words
each) but far fewer of them, with about 30% of ut-
terances containing none at all.
We turn now to the models? performance on full
parse trees, shown in Table 4. Two different scores
are given for each system: the first includes the
top-level bracketing of the full sentence (which is
26
standard in computing bracketing accuracy, but is a
free true positive), while the second does not (for a
more accurate picture of the system?s performance
on ambiguous brackets). Comparing the second set
of scores to the clumping evaluation, recall is much
lower for all the chunkers; the relatively small in-
crease in precision indicates that the chunkers are
most effective at finding low-level structure. For
both sets of scores, the relative F-scores of the chun-
kers are similar to the clumping evaluation, with
the words + acoustics versions of the THMM and
CHMM scoring best. Not surprisingly, the CCL
parser has much higher recall than the chunkers,
though the best chunkers have much higher preci-
sion. The result is that, using standard Parseval
scoring (first column), the best chunkers outperform
CCL on F-score; even discounting the free sentence-
level bracket (second column) they do about as well.
It is worth noting that, although CCL achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the English WSJ
and German Negra corpora (Seginer (2007) reports
75.9% F-score on WSJ10, for example), its perfor-
mance on our corpus is far lower. In fact, on this cor-
pus the CCL parser (as well as our chunkers) under-
perform a uniform right-branching baseline, which
obtains 42.2% precision and 64.8% recall (including
the top-level bracket), leading to an overall F-score
of 51.1%. This suggests that our corpus is signifi-
cantly more difficult than WSJ, probably due to dis-
fluencies and/or lack of punctuation.12 Moreover,
we stress that the use of a right-branching baseline,
while useful as a measure of overall performance,
is not plausible as a model of language acquisition
since it is highly language-specific.
5 Conclusion
Taken together, our results indicate that a purely
local model that combines lexical and acoustic-
prosodic information in an appropriate way can
identify syntactic phrases far more effectively than
a similar model using either source of information
alone. Our best combined models outperformed
the baseline individual models by a wide margin
when evaluated against the lowest level of syntac-
tic structure, and their performance was compara-

cause the punctuation in this corpus is nearly all sentence-final.
ble to CCL, a state-of-the-art unsupervised lexical-
ized parser, when evaluated against full parse trees.
It is disappointing that all of these systems scored
worse than a right-branching baseline, but this result
underscores the major differences between parsing
spoken utterances (even using transcriptions) and
parsing written text (where CCL and other unsu-
pervised parsers were developed and tested). Since
children learning language do not (at least initially)
know the head direction of their language, the right-
branching baseline for English is not available to
them. Thus, combining lexical and acoustic cues
may provide them with initial useful information
about the location of syntactic phrases, as suggested
by the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis.
Nevertheless, we caution against assuming that
the usefulness of acoustic information must re-
sult from its relation to prosody (especially be-
cause we found that direct acoustic information was
more useful than hand-annotated prosodic labels).
The ?Smooth Signal Hypothesis? (Aylett and Turk,
2004) posits that talkers modulate their communica-
tive effort according to the predictability of their
message in order to achieve efficient communica-
tion, pronouncing more predictable parts of mes-
sages more quickly or less distinctly. If talkers con-
sider syntactic predictability in this process, then
it is possible that acoustic cues help initial gram-
mar learning not by serving as cues to prosody but
by serving as cues to the talker?s syntax-dependent
view of predictability. In this case, it may make
more sense to discuss ?predictability bootstrapping?
rather than ?prosodic bootstrapping.?
Regardless of the underlying reason, we have
shown that acoustic cues can be useful for identi-
fying syntactic structure when used in combination
with lexical information. In order to further substan-
tiate these results, we plan to replicate our experi-
ments on a corpus of child-directed speech, which
we are currently annotating for evaluation purposes.
We also hope to extend our findings to a model that
can identify hierarchical structure, and to analyze
more carefully the reasons for CCL?s poor perfor-
mance on the Switchboard corpus, in hopes of devel-
oping a model that can reach levels of performance
closer to those typical of unsupervised parsers for
written text.
