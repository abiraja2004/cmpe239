Abstract 
In the area of large French speech corpora, 
there is a demonstrated need for a common 
prosodic notation system allowing for easy 
data exchange, comparison, and automatic an-
notation. The major questions are: (1) how to 
develop a single simple scheme of prosodic 
transcription which could form the basis of 
guidelines for non-expert manual annotation 
(NEMA), used for linguistic teaching and re-
search; (2)  based on this NEMA, how to es-
tablish reference prosodic corpora (RPC) for 
different discourse genres (Cresti and Mo-
neglia, 2005); (3) how to use the RPC to de-
velop corpus-based learning methods for 
automatic prosodic labelling in spontaneous 
speech (Buhman et al, 2002; Tamburini and 
Caini 2005, Avanzi, et al 2010). This paper 
presents two pilot experiments conducted with 
a consortium of 15 French experts in prosody 
in order to provide a prosodic transcription 
framework (transcription methodology and 
transcription reliability measures) and to es-
tablish reference prosodic corpora in French. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper the case of the prosodic annotation 
of spontaneous French speech is discussed. Ever 
since the ToBI system was introduced in the in-
ternational speech community (Silverman et al, 
1992), it has been considered by some ? irrespec-
tive of the language to be annotated1 - as a stan-
dard for prosodic annotation, while others con-
tend that ToBI cannot be regarded as a universal 
annotation tool, i.e. it is not appropriate to cap-
ture the prosodic properties of certain languages. 
This is especially true when dealing with sponta-
neous speech, for which new methods of annota-
tion must be found. In other words, a better pro-

Fougeron (2002). 
sodic labelling is essential to improve linguistic 
analyses of prosody (Martin 2003, as well as re-
search in speech technology (Wightman 2002). 
Linguistics and speech technology have dealt 
with prosodic transcription from various points 
of view, which makes a precise definition of the 
task difficult. An initial distinction can be drawn 
between (i) phonological approaches (Silverman 
et al, 1992; Hirst and Di Cristo, 1998; Delais-
Roussarie, 2005; etc.), and (ii) acoustic-phonetic 
prosodic analysis (Beaugendre et al, 1992; 
Mertens, 2004). Nowadays, these two ap-
proaches still remain problematic. The coding 
schemes of the former reflect not only a specific, 
and rather narrow, phonological point of view, 
but also the phonetic poverty of the transcription 
(most of the time, only information about the 
fundamental frequency is delivered, and no in-
formation regarding intensity, vocal quality, 
variations in syllabic length and speech disfluen-
cies is provided). In the second approach, very 
fine-grained descriptions and modelling have 
been conducted (House, 1990; Mertens, 2004), 
but they are too rich to be easily exportable. The 
question therefore remains: what is the best 
compromise between an overly detailed phonetic 
description and a phonological annotation which 
is too narrow from a theoretical point of view? In 
an attempt to answer this question, the following 
prerequisites underpin our approach to prosodic 
annotation. First, it should be based on a theory-
independent phonological labelling. To achieve 
this, we have designed an inductive prosodic 
processing which does not impose a phonologi-
cal (generative) mould, but in which various ex-
isting notation systems (such as ToBI, Intsint, 
IVTS, see references below) could be integrated. 
Second, the annotation proposed by the expert 
should be easily reproducible by non-expert an-
notators and finally carried out by computers (in 
order to reduce the cost of human processing and 
265
to avoid the subjectivity and variability of man-
ual treatment).  
This paper deals with an initial set of funda-
mental questions: (i) What does it mean to de-
velop a theory-independent method of annota-
tion? What does it imply in terms of methodo-
logical choices? (ii) Can we consider a type of 
annotation which is based on a categorical proc-
essing of prosody as well as continuous judg-
ment, or is the latter too difficult to implement 
and process in a shared prosodic annotation? (iii) 
What kind of preliminary analysis is required in 
order to write a well-documented guideline shar-
able in the community for French prosody anno-
tation? These three questions led us to conduct 
two pilot experiments in 2009, which are pre-
sented here. Each section is structured as fol-
lows: description of the corpus, the task, and the 
results, and a brief discussion of the experiment 
in question to explain the final choices made for 
the reference prosodic labelling summarized in 
the conclusion.  
2 Pilot experiment one 
This first experiment was conducted on a 63 sec. 
(335 syllables) recording, consisting in a mono-
logue of spontaneous speech (interview with a 
shopkeeper in southern France). The recording 
was processed by 15 expert annotators (native 
French researchers in phonology and/or phonet-
ics). The goal of this section is to present (?2.1) 
the task and its different steps, (?2.2) the results 
of the coding regarding inter-annotator agree-
ment and (?2.3) the major problems revealed by 
the results concerning the coding method. 
2.1 The task 
The prosodic annotation is based first on the 
marking of two boundary levels, second on the 
identification of perceptual prominences, and 
finally on the labelling of disfluencies and hesita-
tions. 
Given our bias neutrality theory, no constraint 
was set a priori regarding prosodic domain and 
constituents separated by a prosodic break 
(rhythmic, syntactic or pragmatic units; this point 
concerns the functional interpretation to be con-
ducted later). Concerning prominences, we con-
sidered that prominence was syllabic and had not 
to be merged with the notion of stress. This 
means that a prominent syllable is considered as 
a perceptual figure emerging from its back-
ground. Finally, we defined disfluency as an 
element which breaks the linear flow of speech, 
whatever the element is: it can be a syllable, a 
word, a morpheme unit, part of a sentence, etc. 
The starting point of the procedure is a semi-
automatic alignment processing (Goldman, 
2008) conducted under Praat (Boersma and 
Weenink, 2010 which provides a 3-layer seg-
mentation structure: segmentation within a 
phones string, syllabic string, and words string. 
They are all displayed on 3 temporally aligned 
tiers. Three empty tiers aligned on the syllabic 
tier have to be annotated (FRONT for marking 
the prosodic boundaries, PROM for annotating 
prominences and DYSF for coding disfluencies). 
Finally, a COMMENTS tier can be used to point 
out some mistakes in the annotation task and/or 
errors in the pre-processing (wrong segmentation 
or transcription, etc). An example of an anno-
tated output file is given in figure 1.  
Since the annotators do not have access to the 
acoustic parameters (melodic and intensity line, 
spectral information), the identification of pro-
sodic boundaries, prominences and disfluencies 
is based only on perceptual processing. The cod-
ing methodology (categorical scale for the anno-
tation) is structured in the following way: each 
annotator browses the file from left to right and 
organises the work in 3 steps.  
? First step: FRONT Tier processing, 
two degrees of prosodic boundary 
First, each annotator has to identify breath 
groups (henceforth BG, marker ?2? at the end of 
the BG). A BG is defined as follows: it corre-
sponds to a string of syllables bounded left and 
right by a silent pause, regardless of the function 
or duration of the pause.  
 
Example:  
#C?est clair2# 
(#it is obvious#) 
 
Second, in each BG, the expert indicates 
where he perceives the end of an internal pro-
sodic group (IPG, marker ?1?). 
 
Example: 
#mais1 je vais aussi1 leur donner de moi-m?me2# 
(#and I will also give them of myself#) 
 
If the annotator is not sure about the presence of 
a prosodic boundary, he uses the indeterminacy 
marker ???. In this way, two degrees of prosodic 
boundary are identified (major: BG and minor: 
IPG). Then, IPG are used to determine internal 
prosodic segments, which form the new anchor 
266
points (coding span) for the following processing 
steps (prominences and disfluencies annotation). 
? Second step: PROM tier processing 
The marker ?1? is associated to syllables per-
ceived as prominent (? terminal: la re1lation1: 
the relationship), and the indeterminacy marker 
??? indicates the locations where the annotator 
hesitates between the presence and the absence 
of a prominence. 
 
Example: 
La personne? va vous ra1conter sa vie1 
(the man will tell you his life). 
 
The accentual clash rule (Dell, 1984; Pasdeloup 
1990) is not taken into account. In other words, 
two or more contiguous syllables can be anno-
tated as prominent. 
? Third step: DISF tier processing 
As for the coding of prominences, the experts 
use the symbol ?1? to indicate the disfluencies 
clearly identified and ??? to point out a hesitation. 
The latter context is often linked to lengthening 
and final post-tonic schwa.

syllables, boundaries (FRONT), prominences (PROM), disfluencies (DISF), graphemic words and comments. 
The empty segments correspond to any prosodic events detected in which the comment points out an incorrect 
syllabic labelling. 
2.2 Results of the coding: inter-annotator 
agreement in pilot experiment one  
? Agreement measure 
The kappa statistic has been widely used in the 
past decade to assess inter-annotator agreement 
in prosodic labelling tasks (Syrdal and McGory, 
2000), and in particular the reliability of inter-
annotator agreement in the case of a categorical 
rating, (Carletta, 1996). Among the many ver-
sions proposed in the literature, we selected the 
Fleiss? kappa (Fleiss, 1971), which provides an 
overall agreement measure over a fixed number 
of annotators in the case of categorical rating 
(unlike Cohen's Kappa which only provides a 
measure of pairwise agreement). 
? Results 
Figure 2 presents the Fleiss? kappa agreement for 
each prosodic label. Indeterminacy markers were 
simply processed as missing values and removed 
from the annotation data. 
 
 
 
267
Figure 2. Inter-annotator agreement for each prosodic 
label 
 
These results show moderate agreement on 
prosodic boundaries for FRONT1 (0.56) and  
FRONT2 (0.86). While agreement on major pro-
sodic boundaries seems to be strong, it should be 
remembered that this marker was formally im-
posed on the annotators in the instructions. Con-
sequently, the score questions the relevancy of 
the task: if a few annotators did not follow it, it is 
probably because in specific distributions, the 
end of a BG does not correspond to a major pro-
sodic boundary. Furthermore, experts noticed 
that a prosodic break could be stronger at the end 
of an IPG than at the end of a BG where the si-
lent pause is not necessarily due to a prosodic 
break, especially in spontaneous speech. Promi-
nence labeling provides moderate agreement 
(0.68), better than FRONT1, and better than the 
agreement scores found in the literature for other 
prominence labelling tasks for French speech 
(Morel et al, 2006)2. Finally, disfluency label-
ling shows substantial agreement, disagreements 
being mostly due to confusion between the 
prominent or disfluent status of a syllable.  
2.3 Conclusion on pilot experiment one 
The results of this first experiment call for the 
following comments. While identification of 
hesitations and disfluencies seems to be an easy 
task, the annotation of prosodic boundaries and 
prominences raises a set of methodological and 
linguistic questions: (i) Are the concepts suffi-
ciently well-defined to represent the same pro-
sodic reality for each annotator? (ii) How far are 
the experts influenced by their theoretical back-
ground or phonological knowledge? (iii) To what 
extent does the fixed coding methodology intro-
duce noise in the labelling (for instance, does the 
end of a BG systematically correspond to a major 
prosodic boundary)? (iv) Is a 3-step annotation 
coding too heavy a cognitive task, incompatible 
with the principle of economy required by a 
sharable prosodic annotation scheme?  
3 Pilot experiment two 
For this second experiment, we chose the same 
recording (speaker from southern France, 63 sec.

 These better results are probably due to the more stringent 
method of annotation imposed. 
of speech) and a second one that was more diffi-
cult because of its interactive dimension and be-
cause it contains many speech overlaps and dis-
fluencies (3 speakers of Normandy, 60 seconds 
of speech, 284 syllables to label). The data were 
processed by 11 experts. This section follows the 
same organization as section 2. 
3.1 The task: focus on prosodic packaging 
For this second experiment, we selected to focus 
the annotation on the most problematic point in 
the first experiment, namely the coding of pro-
sodic breaks. We conjectured that the lack of 
agreement derived first from the terminology that 
the experts were asked to use: the concept of 
prosodic boundary, which is phonologically 
marked and also theory-dependent, might explain 
the lack of consensus between experts belonging 
to different schools. Consequently, each annota-
tor was asked to carry out only one task, called 
prosodic packaging. In this task, the expert had 
to segment the flow of speech into a string of 
prosodic packages (Mertens, 1993; Chafe 1998) 
as far as possible according to his perceptual 
processing, i.e. independently of any underlying 
functional and formal constraints.  
Given the nature of the task, the method of an-
notation was not imposed, unlike the first ex-
periment. In other words, each annotator fixed 
his own coding span. Finally the experts were 
required to carry out a meta-analysis, justifying 
their coding span and trying to understand and 
explain the cues they had used for the packaging 
task (acoustic, rhythmic, syntactic, pragmatic 
criteria).  
Each Praat textgrid is composed of five tiers 
(see figure 3 below): three tiers are used as an-
chor points for the annotation (syllables, words 
and ?Loc.?, which indicates the speaker 
changes), and only one tier has to be annotated 
(prosodic packages); the Comments tier is also 
displayed with the same function as in experi-
ment one. Four symbols are used for the annota-
tion (continuous scale rating): ???: hesitancy re-
garding the end of a package; ?1?: end of a pack-
age, weak break with the following package; 
?2??: indeterminacy regarding the degree of the 
transition between two packages (weak or 
strong); ?2?: strong breaks between two pack-
ages.

3.2 Results of the coding: inter-annotator 
agreement in pilot experiment two 
? Agreement measures 
In addition to the Fleiss?kappa test used in the 
first experiment, we introduced here the 
Weighted Cohen's Kappa (Fleiss and Cohen, 
1973) which provides a pairwise agreement 
measure in the case of ordinal categorical rating 
(categorical labels are ordered along a continu-
ous scale). In particular, weighted Cohen?s 
Kappa weights disagreement according to the 
nature of the disagreed labels. Linear Cohen?s 
Kappa was used in this experiment. 
In this second experiment, we addressed three 
kind of inter-annotator agreement: (i) Presence 
of the end of a prosodic package (PPP), i.e. to 
what extent did annotators agree about the end of 
a prosodic package? (ii) Location of the end of 
a prosodic package: annotators may agree on a 
PPP, but disagree on the exact location of this 
boundary. This was measured by adding a toler-
ance on the location of the PPP (1-order syllable 
context). (iii) Strength of the end of PPP, i.e. 
how much annotators agree about the degree of a 
prosodic boundary. 
Fleiss? kappa was estimated for the first two 
problems, and Linear Cohen?s Kappa for the last 
(indeterminacy markers being considered as in-
termediate degrees). 
? Results 
Figure 4 presents the agreement scores for the 
three cases mentioned above and for the two cor-
pora used. 
 
 
Figure 4. Inter-annotator agreement according to 
presence, location, and strength of the end of prosodic 
package. 
 
Overall agreement scores indicate a significantly 
lower agreement for the second corpus. This is 
probably related to its higher complexity (low 
audio quality, high level of interaction, many 
disfluencies, regional accent) which made the 
task harder to process. The comparison of pres-
ence (corpus 1 = 0.71; corpus 2 = 0.56) versus 
strength (corpus 1 = 0.67; corpus 2 = 0.53) of 
the end of a prosodic package agreements sug-
gests that categorical rating is more reliable than 
ordinal rating. In other words, annotators appear 
to perform better at rating the categorical status 
of a syllable rather than its precise degree. On the 
location problem, it is first interesting to note 
that the occurrence of such a location shift is sig-
nificant in the prosodic labelling. In the present 
study, the location shift represents respectively 
12% and 18% of syllables that were rated as PPP 
by at least one of the annotators (balance effect, 
see figure 5). Thus, merging these shifts leads to 
a higher agreement score (corpus 1 = 0.75 and 
corpus 2 = 0.63 after merging). 
 
269

now) 
 
? Annotator clustering 
Finally, we investigated whether the experts? 
phonological models affected the way in which 
they perceive prosodic objects. 
First, annotators were labelled by the authors 
according to their assumed underlying phono-
logical model. This resulted in 4 groups (3 dif-
ferent phonological models + a residual group: 
two speech engineers involved in signal process-
ing with no phonological model).  
The annotators were then hierarchically clus-
tered according to their agreement score (see fig-
ure 6). This hierarchical clustering was achieved 
through complete linkage on semi-euclidean dis-
tance between annotator agreement (see Hastie et 
al., 2009 for details) 
 
Figure 6. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the 
annotators according to their agreement on both cor-
pora. 
 
Interestingly, this results in three main clusters 
that significantly match the three previously de-
fined groups for process annotation: (i) A tonal 
perception (G1) and syntactic functional ap-
proach (Mertens, 1993); (ii) Cognitive process-
ing (G2), trying to segment the flow of speech 
independently of syntactic constraints (Lacheret, 
2007; see the notion of flow of thought in Chafe, 
1998); (iii) a formal approach (G3) based on pro-
sodic phonology (Nespor and Vogel, 1986) and 
the problem of mapping between prosodic struc-
ture and generative syntax (Selkirk, 1984). 
3.3 Conclusion on pilot experiment two 
Two main conclusions emerge from this second 
experiment. (i) Even if prosodic constructions 
are in many respects continuous mechanisms, it 
seems more realistic for the time being to con-
sider a method based on a categorical annotation. 
(ii) This second experiment confirms that the 
experts? phonological models significantly affect 
annotation and questions the reliability of expert 
annotation. However further investigation is 
needed and a comparison with non-expert anno-
tators must be conducted before drawing any 
definitive conclusions.  
4 Conclusion  
Given the results of pilot experiments 1 and 2, 
we conclude that neither the static concept of 
prosodic boundary, nor its dynamic substitute 
prosodic packaging leads to a high inter-
annotator consensus. In other words, these two 
concepts are probably too dependent on different 
levels of processing (syntactic, phonological, and 
rhythmic) and each annotator, depending on his 
own definition of the notion (formal or func-
tional) will focus on one aspect or another. Con-
270
sequently, even if precise instructions are given 
for annotation, the labelled data still remain het-
erogeneous. Therefore, these two concepts 
should not be used as the basis for the develop-
ment of a shared prosodic annotation method 
aiming to establish a reference prosodic corpus 
and annotation software, which are essential 
tools in handling large volumes of speech data. 
In contrast, we hypothesize that prominence an-
notation based on perceptual criteria represents 
the cornerstone of speech prosodic segmentation, 
as prosodic structure will be generated from 
prominence labelling. Although the results of the 
first pilot experiment are rather poor 0.68), re-
cent experiments have shown that the scores rise 
(0.86) after training sessions (Avanzi et al
2010b). We have therefore decided to focus our 
annotation guideline on the labelling of promi-
nences (two levels of prominence: strong or 
weak) and disfluencies (hesitations, false starts, 
speaker overlaps, post-tonic schwas, etc.). The 
method does not depend on some abstract prop-
erty of words or groups of words, as in the case 
of lexical stress (Martin, 2006; Poir?, 2006; Post 
et al 2006), but is based on a neutral phonetic 
definition of prominence, associated with percep-
tual salience in the context of the speech back-
ground. This approach has the advantage of be-
ing consensual, whatever the theoretical frame-
work adopted. Based on these criteria, a one day 
training session has been organized for 5 novice 
annotators (students in linguistics) in order to 
annotate 3.30 hours of different speech genres 
(private, public, professional), over 2 months 
(from February to April 2010). For each genre a 
monologal and an interactional sample of around 
5 minutes (42 speech files altogether) have to be 
labelled. Prominences and disfluencies are coded 
on two independent tiers. 
The annotation deliverable will be processed 
during the spring by five experts who will have 
to perform four tasks: (i) compute the inter-
annotator scores applying the statistical measures 
used in the two pilot experiments; (ii) diagnose 
the distributions with the poorest scores for all 
the samples; (iii) diagnose the genres with the 
worst scores and  (iv)  make explicit decisions to 
provide an output prosodic reference annotation 
and to enhance automatic prominence detection 
software (see for French: Avanzi et al, 2010a; 
Martin 2010; Obin et al 2008a, 2008b, 2009; 
Simon et al 2008).
