This paper presents a new approach for resolving lexical ambiguities in one language using statis- 
tical data from a monolingual corpus of another language. This approach exploits the differences 
between mappings of words to senses in different languages. The paper concentrates on the prob- 
lem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable. 
The presented algorithm identifies yntactic relations between words, using a source language 
parser, and maps the alternative interpretations ofthese relations to the target language, using a 
bilingual exicon. The preferred senses are then selected according to statistics on lexical relations 
in the target language. The selection is based on a statistical model and on a constraint prop- 
agation algorithm, which simultaneously handles all ambiguities in the sentence. The method 
was evaluated using three sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very use- 
ful for disambiguation. The paper includes a detailed comparative analysis of statistical sense 
disambiguation methods. 
1. Introduction 
The resolution of lexical ambiguities in nonrestricted text is one of the most difficult 
tasks of natural anguage processing. A related task in machine translation, on which 
we focus in this paper, is target word selection. This is the task of deciding which 
target language word is the most appropriate quivalent of a source language word 
in context. In addition to the alternatives introduced by the different word senses of 
the source language word, the target language may specify additional alternatives that 
differ mainly in their usage. 
Traditionally, several inguistic levels were used to deal with this problem: syn- 
tactic, semantic, and pragmatic. Computationally, the syntactic methods are the most 
affordable, but are of no avail in the frequent situation when the different senses of the 
word show the same syntactic behavior, having the same part of speech and even the 
same subcategorization frame. Substantial pplication of semantic or pragmatic knowl- 
edge about the word and its context requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, 
the usefulness of which for practical applications in broad domains has not yet been 
proven (e.g., Lenat et al 1990; Nirenburg et al 1988; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidron 
1985). Moreover, such methods usually do not reflect word usages. 
Statistical approaches, which were popular several decades ago, have recently 
reawakened and were found to be useful for computational linguistics. Within this 
framework, a possible (though partial) alternative to using manually constructed

knowledge can be found in the use of statistical data on the occurrence of lexical re- 
lations in large corpora (e.g., Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan 1986). The use of such 
relations (mainly relations between verbs or nouns and their arguments and modi- 
fiers) for various purposes has received growing attention in recent research (Church 
and Hanks 1990; Zernik and Jacobs 1990; Hindle 1990; Smadja 1993). More specifically, 
two recent works have suggested using statistical data on lexical relations for resolving 
ambiguity of prepositional phrase attachment (Hindle and Rooth 1991) and pronoun 
references (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991). 
Clearly, statistics on lexical relations can also be useful for target word selection. 
Consider, for example, the Hebrew sentence xtracted from the foreign news section 
of the daily Ha-Aretz, September 1990 (transcripted to Latin letters): 
(1) Nose ze mana" mi-shtei ha-mdinot mi-lahtom "al hoze shalom. 
issue this prevented from-two the-countries from-signing on treaty peace 
\[ 
This sentence would translate into English as 
(2) This issue prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty. 
The verb lahtom has four senses: 'sign,' 'seal,' finish,' and 'close.' The noun hoze 
means both 'contract' and 'treaty,' where the difference is mainly in usage rather than 
in the meaning (in Hebrew the word h.oze is used for both sub-senses). 
One possible solution is to consult a Hebrew corpus tagged with word senses, 
from which we would probably learn that the sense 'sign' of lahtom appears more 
frequently with hoze as its object han all the other senses. Thus we should prefer that 
sense. However, the size of corpora required to identify lexical relations in a broad 
domain is very large, and therefore it is usually not feasible to have such corpora 
manually tagged with word senses) The problem of choosing between 'treaty' and 
'contract' cannot be solved using only information on Hebrew, because Hebrew does 
not distinguish between them. 
The solution suggested in this paper is to identify the lexical relations in corpora 
of the target language, instead of the source language. We consider word combinations 
and count how often they appear in the same syntactic relation as in the ambiguous 
sentence. For the above example, the noun compound 'peace treaty' appeared 49 times 
in our corpus (see Section 4.3 for details on our corpus), whereas the compound 'peace 
contract' did not appear at all; the verb-obj combination 'to sign a treaty' appeared 79 
times, whereas none of the other three alternatives appeared more than twice. Thus, 
we first prefer 'treaty' to 'contract' because of the noun compound 'peace treaty' and 
then proceed to prefer 'sign' since it appears most frequently having the object 'treaty.' 
The order of selection is determined by a constraint propagation algorithm. In both 
cases, the correctly selected word is not the most frequent one: 'close' is more frequent 
in our corpus than 'sign' and 'contract' is more frequent than 'treaty.' Also, by using 
a model of statistical confidence, the algorithm avoids a decision in cases in which no 
alternative is significantly better than the others. 
Our approach can be analyzed from two different points of view. From that of 
monolingual sense disambiguation, we exploit the fact that the mapping between 
words and word senses varies significantly among different languages. This enables

of several sense disambiguation methods.

US to map an ambiguous construct from one language to another, obtaining repre- 
sentations in which each sense corresponds to a distinct word. Now it is possible 
to collect co-occurrence statistics automatically from a corpus of the other language, 
without requiring manual tagging of senses. 2 
From the point of view of machine translation, we suggest hat some ambigu- 
ity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language than the source 
language. The source language sentences are considered a noisy source for target lan- 
guage sentences, and our task is to devise a target language model that prefers the 
most reasonable translation. Machine translation is thus viewed in part as a recogni- 
tion problem, and the statistical model we use specifically for target word selection 
may be compared with other language models in recognition tasks (e.g., Katz 1987; 
Jelinek 1990, for speech recognition). To a limited extent, this view is shared with the 
statistical machine translation system of Brown et al (1990), which employs a target 
language n-gram model (see Section 8 for a comparison with this system). In contrast 
to this view, previous approaches in machine translation typically resolve examples 
like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg 1987). 
As explained above, such constraints cannot be acquired automatically and therefore 
are usually limited in their coverage. 
The experiments we conducted clearly show that statistics on lexical relations are 
very useful for disambiguation. Most notable is the result for the set of examples 
of Hebrew to English translation, which was picked randomly from foreign news 
sections in the Israeli press. For this set, the statistical model was applicable for 70% 
of the ambiguous words, and its selection was then correct for 91% of the cases. We 
cite also the results of a later experiment (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993) that 
tested a weaker variant of our method on texts in the computer domain, achieving a
precision of 85%. Both results significantly improve upon a naive method that uses 
only a priori word probabilities. These results are comparable to recent reports in 
the literature (see Section 7). It should be emphasized, though, that our results were 
achieved for a realistic simulation of a broad coverage machine translation system, on 
randomly selected examples. We therefore believe that our figures reflect he expected 
performance of the algorithm in a practical implementation. On the other hand, most 
other results relate to a small number of words and senses that were determined by 
the experimenters. 
Section 2 of the paper describes the linguistic model we use, employing a syntac- 
tic parser and a bilingual lexicon. Section 3 presents the statistical model, assuming 
a multinomial model for a single lexical relation and then using a constraint propa- 
gation algorithm to account simultaneously for all relations in the sentence. Section 4 
describes the experimental Setting. Section 5 presents and analyzes the results of the 
experiment and cites additional results (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). In 
Section 6 we analyze the limitations of the algorithm in different cases and suggest 
enhancements to improve it. We also discuss the possibility of adopting the algorithm 
for monolingual applications. Finally, in Section 7 we present a comparative analysis 
of statistical sense disambiguation methods and then conclude in Section 8. 
2 A similar observation underlies the use of parallel bilingual corpora for sense disambiguation (Brown 
et al 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992). As we explain in Section 7, these corpora re a form of a 
manually tagged corpus and are more difficult o obtain than monolingual corpora. Erroneously, the 
preliminary publication of our method (Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991) was cited several times as 
requiring aparallel bilingual corpus,

2. The Linguistic Model 
Our approach is first to use a bilingual exicon to find all possible translations of each 
lexically ambiguous word in the source sentence and then use statistical information 
gathered from target language corpora to choose the most appropriate alternative. To 
carry out this task we need the following linguistic tools, which are discussed in detail 
in the following sections: 
Section 2.1: Parsers for both the source language and the target language. 
These parsers hould be capable of locating relevant syntactic relations, 
such as subj-verb, verb-obj, etc. 
Section 2.2: A bilingual exicon that lists alternative translations for each 
source language word. If a word belongs to several syntactic ategories, 
there should be a separate list for each one. 
Section 2.3: A procedure for mapping the source language syntactic 
relations to those of the target language. 
Such tools have been implemented within the framework of many computational 
linguistic theories. We have used McCord's implementation f Slot Grammars (McCord 
1990, 1991). However, our method could have proceeded just as well using other 
linguistic models. 
The linguistic model will be illustrated by the following Hebrew example, taken 
from the Ha-Aretz daily newspaper f om September, 1990 (transcripted toLatin letters): 
(3) Diplomatim svurim ki hitztarrfuto shell Hon Sun magdila 
diplomats believe that the joining of Hon Sun increases 
et ha-sikkuyim l-hassagat hitqaddmut ba-sihot. 
the-chances for-achieving progress in the-talks 
Here, the ambiguous words in translation to English are magdila, hitqaddmut, and sihot. 
To facilitate the reading, we give the translation of the sentence into English, and 
in each case of an ambiguous election, all the alternatives are listed within curly 
brackets, the first alternative being the correct one. 
(4) Diplomats believe that the joining of Hon Sun {increases I enlarges I
magnifies} the chances for achieving {progress I advance I advancement} 
in the {talks I conversations I calls}. 
The following subsections describe in detail the processing steps of the linguis- 
tic model. These include locating the ambiguous words and the relevant syntactic 
relations among them in the source language sentence, mapping these relations to 
alternative relations in the target language, and finally, counting occurrences of these 
alternatives in a target language corpus. 
2.1 Locating the Ambiguous Words in the Source Language 
Our model defines the different "senses" of a source word to be all its possible trans- 
lations to the target language, as listed in a bilingual lexicon. Some translations can 
be eliminated by the syntactic environment of the word in the source language. For 
example, in the following two sentences the word 'consider' should be translated 
566 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
differently into Hebrew, owing to the different subcategorization frame in each case: 
(5) I consider him smart. 
(6) I consider going to Japan. 
In these examples, the different syntactic subcategorization frames determine two dif- 
ferent translations to Hebrew (mah.shiv ersus shoqel), thus eliminating some of the 
ambiguity. Such syntactic rules that allow us to resolve some of the ambiguities may 
be encoded in the lexicon (e.g., Golan, Lappin, and Rimon 1988). However, many 
ambiguities cannot be resolved on syntactic grounds. The purpose of this work is to 
resolve the remaining ambiguities using lexical co-occurrence preferences, obtained by 
statistical methods. 
2.2 Locating Syntactic Tuples in Source Language Sentences 
Our basic concept is the syntactic tuple, which denotes a syntactic relation between 
two or more words. It is denoted by the name of the syntactic relation followed by 
a sequence of words that satisfies the relation, appearing in their base form (with- 
out morphological inflections). For example (subj-verb: man walk) is a syntactic tuple, 
which occurs in the sentence 'The man walked home.' 
We assume that our parser (or an auxilliary program) can locate the syntactic 
relation corresponding toa given syntactic tuple in a sentence. The use of the base form 
of words is justified by the additional assumption that morphological inflections do 
not affect the probability of syntactic tuples. This assumption is not entirely accurate, 
but it has proven practically useful and reduces the number of distinct tuples. 
In our experience, the following syntactic relations proved useful for resolving 
ambiguities: 
? Relations between a verb and its subject, complements, and adjuncts, 
including direct and indirect objects, adverbs, and modifying 
prepositional phrases. 
? Relations between a noun and its complements and adjuncts, including 
adjectives, modifying nouns in noun compounds, and modifying 
prepositional phrases. 
? Relations between adjectives or adverbs and their modifiers. 
4 
As mentioned earlier, the full list of syntactic relations depends on the syntactic the- 
ory of the parser. Our model is general and does not depend on any particular list. 
However, we have found some desired properties in defining the relevant syntac- 
tic relations. One such property is the use of deep, or canonical, relations, as was 
already identified by Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan (1986). This property was di- 
rectly available from the ESG parser (McCord 1990, 1991), which identifies the under- 
lying syntactic function in constructs uch as passives and relative clauses. We have 
also implemented an additional routine, which modified or filtered some of the rela- 
tions received from the parser. This postprocessing routine dealt mainly with function 
words and prepositional phrases to get a set of more informative relations. For exam- 
ple, it combined the subject and complement of the verb 'be' (as in 'the man is happy') 
into a single relation. Likewise, a verb with its preposition and the head noun of a 
modifying prepositional phrase (as in sit on the chair) were also combined. The routine 
was designed to choose relations that impose considerable r strictions on the possible 
567 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
(or probable) syntactic tuples. On the other hand, these relations should not be too 
specific, to allow statistically meaningful samples. 
The first step in resolving an ambiguity is to find all the syntactic tuples containing 
the ambiguous words. For (3) we get the following syntactic tuples: 
(7) . 
2. 
3. 
4. 
(subj-verb: hitztarrfut higdil) 
(verb-obj: higdil sikkuy) 
(verb-obj: hissig hitqaddmut) 
(noun-pp: hitqaddmut b- sih.a) 
(these tuples translate as joining-increase, increase-chance, achieve-progress, and progress- 
in-talks). In using these tuples, we expect o capture lexical constraints that are imposed 
by syntactic relations. 
2.3 Mapping Syntactic Tuples to the Target Language 
The set of syntactic tuples in the source language sentence is reflected in its translation 
to the target language. As a syntactic tuple is defined by both its syntactic relation and 
the words that appear in it, we need to map both components to the target language. 
By definition, every ambiguous ource language word maps to several target lan- 
guage words. We thus get several alternative target language tuples for each source 
language tuple that involves an ambiguous word. For example, for tuple 3 in (7) 
we obtain three alternatives, corresponding to the three different ranslations of the 
word hitqaddmut. For tuple 4 we obtain nine alternative target uples, since each of the 
words hitqaddmut and siha maps to three different English words. The full mapping of 
the Hebrew tuples in (7) to English tuples appears in Table 1 (the rightmost column 
should be ignored for the moment). Each of the tuple sets (a-d) in this table denotes 
the alternatives for translating the corresponding Hebrew tuple. 
From a theoretical point of view, the mapping of syntactic relations is more prob- 
lematic. There need not be a one-to-one mapping from source language relations to 
target language ones. In many cases the mapping depends on the words of the syn- 
tactic tuple, as seen in the following example of translating from German to English. 
(8) Der Tisch gefaellt mir.--I like the table. 
In this example the source language subject (Tisch) becomes the direct object (table) in 
the target, whereas the direct object (mir) in the source language becomes the subject 
(I) in the target. Therefore, the German syntactic tuples 
(9) (subj-verb: Tisch gefaellt) 
(verb-obj: gefaellt mir) 
are mapped to the following English syntactic tuples 
(10) (verb-obj: like table) 
(subj-verb: I like) 
(The Hebrew equivalent is similar to the German structure). 
In practice this is less of a problem. In most cases, the source language relation 
has a direct equivalent in the target language. In many other cases, transformation 
rules can be encoded, either in the lexicon (if they are word dependent) or as syntactic 
transformations. These rules are usually available in machine translation systems that

use the transfer method, as this knowledge is required to generate target language 
structures. 
To facilitate further the mapping of syntactic relations and to avoid errors due to 
fine distinctions between them, we grouped related syntactic relations into a single 
"general class" and mapped this class to the target language. The important classes 
used were relations between a verb and its arguments and modifiers (counting as one 
class all objects, indirect objects, complements, and nouns in modifying prepositional 
phrases) and between a noun and its arguments and modifiers (counting as one class 
all modifying nouns in compounds and nouns in modifying prepositional phrases). 
The classification enables us to get more statistical data for each class, as it reduces 
the number of relations. The success of using this general level of syntactic relations 
indicates that even a rough mapping of source to target language relations is useful 
for the statistical model. 
2.4 Counting Syntactic Tuples in the Target Language Corpus 
We now wish to determine the plausibility of each alternative target word being the 
translation of an ambiguous ource word. In our model, the plausibility of selecting 
a target word is determined by the plausibility of the tuples that are obtained from 
it. The plausibility of alternative target uples is in turn determined by their relative 
frequency in the corpus. 
Target syntactic tuples are identified in the corpus similarly to source language 
tuples, i.e., by a target language parser and a companion routine as described in Section 
2.1. The right column of Table 1 shows the counts obtained for the syntactic tuples 
of our example in the corpora we used. The table reveals that the tuples containing 
the correct arget word ('talk,' 'progress,' and 'increase') are indeed more frequent. 
569 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
However, we still need a decision algorithm to analyze the statistical significance of 
the data and choose the appropriate word accordingly. 
3. The Statistical Model 
As seen in the previous ection, the linguistic model maps each source language syn- 
tactic tuple to several alternative target uples, in which each alternative corresponds 
to a different selection of target words. We wish to select the most plausible target 
language word for each ambiguous source language word, basing our decision on the 
counts obtained from the target corpus, as illustrated in Table 1. To that end, we should 
define a selection algorithm whose outcome depends on all the syntactic tuples in the 
sentence. If the data obtained from the corpus do not substantially support any one 
of the alternatives, the algorithm should notify the translation system that it cannot 
reach a statistically meaningful decision. 
Our algorithm is based on a statistical model. However, we wish to point out 
that we do not see the statistical considerations, as expressed in the model, as fully 
reflecting the linguistic considerations ( yntactic, semantic, or pragmatic) that deter- 
mine the correct ranslation. The model reflects only part of the relevant data and 
in addition makes statistical assumptions that are only partially satisfied. Therefore, 
a statistically based model need not make the correct linguistic choices. The perfor- 
mance of the model can only be empirically evaluated, the statistical considerations 
serve only as heuristics. The role of the statistical considerations is therefore to guide 
us in constructing heuristics that make use of the linguistic data of the sample (the 
corpus). Our experience shows that the statistical methods are indeed very helpful 
in establishing and comparing useful decision criteria that reflect various linguistic 
considerations. 
3.1 The Probabilistic Model 
First we discuss decisions based on a single syntactic tuple (as when only one syntactic 
tuple in the sentence contains an ambiguous word). Denote the source language syn- 
tactic tuple T and let there be k alternative target uples for T, denoted by T1,.. ?, Tk. 
Let the counts obtained for the target uples be nl,. ?., nk. For notational convenience, 
we number the tuples by decreasing frequency, i.e., nl ~ y/2 ~ "'"  ~ nk- 
Since our goal is to choose for T one of the target uples Ti, we can consider T 
a discrete random variable with multinomial distribution, 3 whose possible values are 
T1, . . . ,  Tk. Let Pi be the probability of obtaining Ti, i.e., the probability that Ti is the 
correct ranslation for T. We estimate the probabilities Pi by the counts ni in the obvious 
way, using the maximum likelihood estimator (Agresti 1990, pp. 40-41). The estimator \]9i 
fo r  Pi is  
Hi 
/~i -- k " (1) 
Y~q=l nj 
The precision of the estimator depends, of course, on the size of the counts in the 
computation. We will incorporate this consideration i to the decision algorithm by 
using confidence intervals. 4 
3 A variable that can have one of a finite set of values, each of them having a fixed probability. 
4 The max imum likelihood estimator is known to give poor estimates when small counts are involved, 
and there are several methods to improve it (see Church and Gale 1991, for a presentation and 
discussion of several methods). For our needs this is not necessary in most cases, since we are not 
going to use the estimate itself, but rather a confidence interval for the ratio between two estimations 
(see below). 
570 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
We now have to establish the criterion for choosing the preferred target language 
syntactic tuple. The most reasonable assumption is to choose the tuple with the high- 
est estimated probability, that is Tl--the tuple with the largest observed frequency. 
According to the model, the probability that T1 is the right choice is estimated as Pl. 
This criterion should be subject o the condition that the difference between the alter- 
native probabilities i significant. For example, if/Yl = 0.51 and/52 = 0.49, the expected 
success rate in choosing T1 is approximately 0.5. To prevent he system from making 
a decision in such cases, we need to impose some conditions on the probabilities Pi. 
One possible such condition is that \]Jl exceeds a prespecified threshold (or, as we 
shall describe below, that the threshold requirement be applied to a confidence inter- 
val). According to the model, this requirement ensures that the success probability of 
every decision exceeds the threshold. Even though this method satisfies the proba- 
bilistic model, it is vulnerable to noise in the data, which often causes ome relatively 
small counts to be larger than their true value in the sample. The noise is introduced 
in part by inaccuracies in the model and in part because of errors during the auto- 
matic collection of the statistical data. Consequently, the estimated value of Pl may 
be smaller than its true value, because other counts in Equation 1 are too large, thus, 
preventing Pl from passing the threshold. 
To deal with this problem, we have chosen another criterion for significance--the 
odds ratio. We choose the alternative T1 only if all the ratios 
r;2' 
exceed a prespecified threshold. Note that 15i/lfij -- ni/nj, and since nl _~ n2 _) ... ~_ nk, 
the ratio tYl/lY2 is less than or equal to all the other ratios. Therefore, it suffices to 
check the odds ratio only for ill/P2. This criterion is less sensitive to noise of the 
above-mentioned type than/)1, since it depends only on the two largest counts. 
3.1.1 Underlying Assumptions. The use of a probabilistic model necessarily intro- 
duces several assumptions on the structure of the corresponding linguistic data. It is 
important to point out these assumptions, in order to be aware of possible inconsis- 
tencies between the model and the linguistic phenomena for which it is used. 
The first assumption is introduced by the use of a multinomial model, which 
presupposes the following: 
Assumption 1 
The events Ti are mutually disjoint. 
This assumption is not entirely valid, since sometimes it is possible to translate a source 
language word to several target language words, such that all the translations are 
valid. For example, consider the Hebrew sentence (from the Ha-Aretz daily newspaper, 
November 27, 1990) whose English translation is
(11) The resignation of Thatcher is not {related I connected} to the negotia- 
tions with Damascus. 
In this sentence (but not in others), the ambiguous word qshura can equally well be 
translated to either 'related' or 'connected.' In terms of the probabilistic model, the two 
corresponding events, i.e., the two alternative English tuples that contain these words, 
T1 -- (verb-comp: relate to negotiation) and T2 = (verb-comp: connect o negotiation) are 
571 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
both correct, thus the events T1 and T2 both occur (they are not disjoint). However, we 
have to make this assumption, since the counts we have, ni, from which we estimate 
the probabilities of the Ti values, count actual occurrences of single syntactic tuples. 
In other words, we count the number of times that each of Zl and T2 actually occur, 
not the number of times in which each of them could occur. 
Two additional assumptions are introduced by using counts of the occurrences of
syntactic tuples of the target language in order to estimate the translation probabilities 
of source language tuples: 
Assumption 2 
An occurrence of the source language syntactic tuple T can indeed be translated to 
one of Zl~...~ Tk. 
Assumption 3 
Every occurrence of the target uple Ti can be the translation of only the source tuple T. 
Assumption 2 is an assumption on the completeness of the linguistic model. It is rather 
reasonable and depends on the completeness of our bilingual exicon: if the lexicon 
gives all possible translations ofeach ambiguous word, then this assumption will hold, 
since for each syntactic tuple T we will produce all possible translations3 
Assumption 3, which may be viewed as a soundness assumption, does not always 
hold, since a target language word may be the translation of several source language 
words. Consider, for example, the Hebrew tuple T = (verb-obj: heh.ziq lul). Lul is am- 
biguous, meaning either a playpen or a chicken pen. Accordingly, T can be translated 
to either T1 = (verb-obj: hold playpen) or T2 = (verb-obj: hold pen). In the context of 
'hold' the first translation is more likely, and we can therefore xpect our model to 
prefer T1. However, this might not be the case because Assumption 3 is contradicted. 
'Pen' can also be the translation of the Hebrew word "et (the writing instrument), and 
thus T2 can be the translation of another Hebrew tuple, T' = (verb~bj: heh.ziq 'et). This 
means that when translating T we are counting occurrences of T2 that correspond 
to both T and T', "misleading" the selection criterion. Section 6.3 illustrates another 
example in which the assumption is not valid, causing the algorithm to fail to select 
the correct ranslation. 
We must make this assumption since we use only a target language corpus, which 
is not related to any source language information. 6 Therefore, when seeing an occur- 
rence of the target language word w, we do not know which source language word is 
appropriate in the current context. Consequently, we count its occurrence as a transla- 
tion of all the source language words for which w is a possible translation. This implies 
that sometimes we use inaccurate data, which introduce noise into the statistical model 
(see Section 6.3 for a discussion of an alternative, but expensive, solution, using a bilin- 
gual corpus). As we shall see, even though the assumption does not always hold, in 
most cases this noise does not interfere with the decision algorithm. 
5 The problem of constructing a bilingual exicon that is as complete as possible is beyond the scope of 
this paper. A promising approach may be to use aligned bilingual corpora, especially for augmenting 
existing lexicons with domain-specific terminology (Brown et al 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993). 
In any case, it seems that any translation system is limited by the completeness of its bilingual exicon, 
which makes our assumption a reasonable one. 
6 As explained in the introduction, this is a very important advantage of our method over other methods 
that use bilingual corpora.

3.2 Statistical Significance of the Decision 
Another problem we should address is the statistical significance of the data--what 
confidence do we have that the data indeed reflect he phenomenon. If the decision is 
based on small counts, then the difference in the counts might be due to chance. For 
example, we should have more confidence in the odds ratio 151/152 = 3 when nl = 30 
and //2 = 10 than when nl = 3 and n2 = 1. Consequently, we shall use a dynamic 
threshold for 151/152, which is large when the counts are small and decreases as the 
counts increase. 
A common method for determining the statistical significance of estimates i the 
use of confidence intervals. Rather than finding a confidence interval for 151/152, we 
will bound the log odds ratio, ln(151/152). Since the variance Of the log odds ratio is 
independent of the mean, it converges to the normal distribution faster than the odds 
ratio itself (Agresti 1990). We use a one-tailed interval, as we want only to decide 
whether ln(151/152) is greater than a specific threshold (i.e., we need only a lower bound 
for ln(151/152)). Using this method, for each desired error probability 0 < ~ < 1, we may 
determine a value B~ and state that with a probability of at least 1 - c~ the true value, 
ln(pl/p2), is greater than B~. 
The confidence interval of a random variable X with normal distribution is 
Z I -~ ,  where ZI-~ is the confidence coefficient, which may be found in sta- 
tistical tables, and var is the variance. In our case, the size of the confidence interval 
is 
Z1-~/var\[ln~221" 
In the appendix we approximate the variance by the following 
\[ ~22\] 1 1 var  in 151 ~ __  _}_ - - .  
//1 //2 
The bound we get is thus 
151 //1 Since ~ - //2 we get 
ln(P~2 ) >ln(pP-~)-Z l -~V~n~ + 1 
//2 
l n /P~)  ~>ln/n,~-~)-Zl-c,V/n~+ 1 
//2 
;o 
(2) 
B~(nl,n2) (or B~ when nl and n2 are understood from the context) is defined to 
be the right-hand side of Equation 2. The meaning of the inequality is that for every 
given pair nl~ n2 we know with confidence 1 - c~ that 
In pl ~ B~ (3) 
P2 
or in other words, B,~ is a lower bound for ln(pl/P2) with this confidence level. 
To obtain a decision criterion, we choose a threshold 0, for B~, and decide to 
choose T1 only if 
B~ > 0. (4) 
573 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
If Equation 4 does not hold, the algorithm makes no decision. The meaning of this 
criterion is that only if we know with confidence of at least 1 - ~ that ln(pl/p2) > O, 
will we select he most frequent uple T1 as the appropriate one. In terms of statistical 
decision theory, we say that our null hypothesis is that ln(pl/P2) < 0, and we will 
make a decision only if we can reject this hypothesis with confidence at least 1 - ~. 
Note that we cannot compute B~ when one of the counts is zero. In this case we have 
used the common correction method of adding 0.5 to each of the counts (Agresti 1990, 
p. 249). 7 
We shall now demonstrate the use of the decision criterion. In the experiment 
we conducted we chose the parameters ~ = 0.1, for which Z~ = 1.282, and 0 = 0.2. 
Thus, to choose T1 we require that with confidence level of at least 90% the hypothesis 
should satisfy ln(pl/P2) > 0.2 (i.e., Pl/P2 >_ e 02 = 1.22). For the alternative translations 
of tuple c in Table 1 we got nl = 29 and n2 = 5. For these values Be = 1.137. In this 
case Equation 4 is satisfied for 0 = 0.2, and the algorithm selects the word 'progress' 
as the translation of the Hebrew word hitqaddmut. 
In another case we had to translate the Hebrew word ro'sh, which can be translated 
to either 'top' or 'head,' in the sentence whose translation is 
(12) Sihanuk stood at the {top \] head} of a coalition of underground groups. 
The two alternative syntactic tuples were 
(a) (verb-pp: standat head) 10 
(b) (verb-pp: stand at top) 5 
For nl = 10 and n2 = 5, we get Be = -0.009 (a negative value means that it is 
impossible to ensure with a 90% confidence level that Pl > P2). Since Be G 0.2, the 
algorithm will refrain from making a decision in this case. This abstention reflects the 
fact that the difference between the counts is not statistically significant, and choosing 
the first alternative can be wrong in many of the cases (as seen in the five cases that 
were observed in the corpus). 
As mentioned above, our motivation was to find a criterion that depends on a 
dynamic threshold for ~1/\]Y2 (or alternatively n l /n2)  , so  that the threshold will be 
higher when nl and n2 are smaller. Our criterion indeed satisfies this requirement. If 
we substitute B~ in Equation 4, we get the following equivalent criterion: 
In nl > 0 + Zl_c~/n~ q- 1 
//2 //2 
The above inequality clarifies the roles of the two parameters, ~ and 0 :0  specifies 
a lower bound on In(nl/n2), which is independent of the sample size; c~ reflects the 
statistical significance. If c~ is decreased (i.e., we require more confidence), ZI_~ will 
increase, and therefore, the component dependent on the sample size will increase. 
Since this component is in inverse relation to nl and n2, the penalty for decreasing 
c~ increases when the sample size decreases. From this analysis we can derive the 
criterion for choosing the parameters: if we wish to use small counts, then c~ should 
be small, and 0 depends on the required ratio between l and n2. The optimal values 
of the parameters should be determined empirically and might depend on the corpora 
and parsers we use. 
7 In this case, smoothing methods (Church and Gale 1991) may improve the correction method.

3.3 Sentences with Several Syntactic Relations 
In the previous section, we assumed that the source sentence contains only one am- 
biguous syntactic tuple. In general there may be several ambiguous words that appear 
in several tuples. We should take advantage of the occurrence patterns of all of the 
tuples to reach a decision. Since different relations may favor different ranslations for 
an ambiguous word, we should devise a strategy for selecting a consistent translation 
for all words in the sentence. We have used the following constraint propagation algo- 
rithm, which receives as input the list of all source tuples along with their alternative 
translations to target uples: 
. 
. 
. 
. 
Compute B~ of each source tuple. If the largest B~ is less than the 
threshold, 8, then stop. 
Let T be the source tuple for which B~ is maximal. Select the translation 
for the ambiguous words (or word) in T according to T1 (the most 
frequent arget alernative for T). Remove T from the list of source tuples. 
Propagate the constraint: eliminate target uples that are inconsistent 
with this decision. If now some source tuples become unambiguous, 
remove them from the list of source tuples. 
Repeat his procedure for the remaining list of source tuples, until all 
ambiguities have been resolved, or the maximal B~ is less than 8. 
To illustrate the algorithm, we consider Table 1 using the parameters c~ = 0.1 
and 0 = 0.2. The largest value of B~ occurs for the tuple (verb-obj: higdil sikkuy), for 
which higdil can be translated to ;increase,' 'magnify,' or 'enlarge.' The first alternative 
appeared nl = 20 times, and the other alternatives did not appear at all, (n2 = n3 = 
0). Adding the correction factor and computing B~ yields B~(nl + 0.5~n2 q-0.5) = 
B,~(20.5, 0.5) = 1.879 > 0.2 = 8. Therefore, the word 'increase' was chosen as the 
translation of higdil. Since this word appears also in the tuple (subj-verb: hitztarrfut 
higdil), the' target tuples that include alternative translations of higdil were deleted. 
Thus 
(13) (subj-verb: joining enlarge) 
(subj-verb: joining magnify) 
were deleted. This leaves us with only one alternative (subj-verb: joining increase) as a 
possible translation of this Hebrew tuple, which is therefore removed from the input 
list. 
We now recompute the values of B~ for the remaining tuples. The maximal value 
is obtained for the tuple 
(14) (verb-obj: hissig hitqaddmut) 
where B~ (29, 5) = 1.137 > 8. We, therefore, choose the word 'progress' as a translation 
for hitqaddmut. Since this word, hitqaddmut, also appears in the tuple (noun-pp: hitqad- 
dmut b- sih.a), we delete the Six target tuples that are inconsistent with the selection 
of 'progress' (those containing the words 'advance' and 'advancement'). There now 
remain only three alternative target uples for hitqaddmut b- sih.a. 
We now recompute the values of B~. The maximum value is B~ (7.5~ 0.5) = 0.836 > 
0 (note that because tuples inconsistent with the previous decisions were eliminated, 
575 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
n2 dropped from 2 to 0, thus increasing B~). Thus, 'talk' is selected as the translation 
of siha. Now all the ambiguities have been resolved and the procedure stops. 
In the above example all the ambiguities were resolved since in each stage the 
value of B~ exceeded the threshold 0 = 0.2. In some cases not all ambiguities are 
resolved, though the number of ambiguities may decrease. 
It should be noted that other methods may be proposed for combining the statis- 
tics of several syntactic relations. For example, it may make sense to multiply estimates 
of conditional probabilities of tuples in different relations, in a way that is analogous 
to n-gram language modeling (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992). However, such an 
approach will make it harder to take into account he statistical significance of the 
estimate (a criterion that is missing in standard n-gram models). In our set of exam- 
ples, the constraint propagation method proved to be successful and did not seem to 
introduce any errors. Further experimentation,  much larger data sets, is needed to 
determine which of the two methods (if any) is substantially superior to the other. 
4. The Experiment 
To evaluate the proposed isambiguation method, we implemented and tested the 
method on a random set of examples. The examples consisted of a set of Hebrew 
paragraphs and a set of German paragraphs. In both cases the target language was 
English. The Hebrew examples consisted of ten paragraphs picked at random from 
foreign news sections of the Israeli press. The paragraphs were selected from several 
news items and articles that appeared in several daily newspapers. The target lan- 
guage corpus consisted of American newspaper articles, and the Hansard corpus of 
the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. The domain of foreign news articles was 
chosen to correspond to some of the topics that appear in the English corpus, s The 
German examples were chosen at random from the German press, without restricting 
the topic. 9 
Since we did not have a translation system from Hebrew or German to English, 
we simulated the steps such a system would perform. Hence, the results we report 
measure the performance of just the target word selection module and not the perfor- 
mance of a complete translation system. The latter can be expected to be somewhat 
lower for a real system, depending on the performance of its other components. Note, 
however, that since the disambiguation module is highly immune to noise, it might 
be more useful in a real system: in such a system some of the alternatives would 
be totally erroneous. Since the corresponding syntactic tuples would typically not be 
found in the corpora, they would be eliminated by our module. 
The experiment is described in detail in the following subsections. It provides 
an example for a thorough evaluation that is carried out without having a complete 
system available. We specifically describe the processing of the Hebrew data, which 
was performed by a professional translator, supervised by the authors. The German 
examples were processed very similarly. 
4.1 Locating Ambiguous Words 
To locate ambiguous words, we simulated a bilingual exicon and syntactic filters of a 
translation system. For every source language word, the translator searched all possible 
8 The corpus includes many irrelevant topics as well, which introduce noisy data with respect o the 
given domain.

Germany.

translations using a Hebrew-English dictionary (Alcalay 1990). The list of translations 
proposed by the dictionary was modified according to the following guidelines, to 
reflect better the lexicon of a practical translation system: 
. 
. 
3. 
. 
. 
Eliminate translations that would be ruled out for syntactic reasons, as 
explained in Section 2.1. 
Consider only content words, ignoring function words and proper nouns. 
Assume that multi-word terms, such as 'prime minister,' appear in the 
lexicon as complete terms. Thus we did not consider each of their 
constituents separately. Also, we did not consider source language words 
that should be translated to a multi-word target phrase. 
Eliminate rare and archaic translations that are not expected in the 
context of foreign affairs in the current press. 
The professional translator added translations that were missing in the 
dictionary. 
In addition, each of the remaining target alernatives for each source word was eval- 
uated as to whether it is a suitable translation in the current context. This evaluation 
was later used to judge the selections of the algorithm. If all the alternatives were 
considered suitable, then the source word was eliminated from the test set, since any 
decision for it would have been considered successful. 
We ended up with 103 Hebrew and 54 German ambiguous words. For each He- 
brew word we had an average of 3.27 alternative translations and an average of 1.44 
correct ranslations. The average number of translations of a German word was 3.26, 
and there were 1.33 correct ranslations. 
4.2 Determining the Syntactic Tuples and Mapping Them to English 
Since we did not have a Hebrew parser, we have simulated the two steps of deter- 
mining the source syntactic tuples and mapping them to English by reversing the 
order of these steps, in the following way: First, the sample sentences were translated 
manually, as literally as possible, into English. Then, the resulting English sentences 
were analyzed, using the ESG parser and the postprocessing routine (see Section 2.2), 
to identify the relevant syntactic tuples. The tuples were further classified into "gen- 
eral classes," as described in Section 2.3. The use of these general classes, which was 
intended to facilitate the mapping of syntactic relations from one language to another, 
also facilitated our simulation method and caused it to produce realistic output. 
At the end of the procedure, we had, for each sample sentence, a data structure 
similar to Table 1 (without the counts). 
4.3 Acquiring the Statistical Data 
The statistical data were acquired from the following corpora: 
? Texts from The Washington Post ~0 million words. 
? The Hansard corpus of protocols of the Canadian Parl iament--85 million 
words. 
? Associated Press news items--24 million words. 
577 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
However, the effective size of the corpora was only about 25 million words, owing to 
two filtering criteria. First, we considered only sentences whose length did not exceed 
25 words, since longer sentences required excessive parse time and contained many 
parsing errors. Second, even 35% of the shorter sentences failed to parse and had to be 
eliminated. The syntactic tuples were located by the ESG parser and the postprocessing 
routine mentioned earlier. 
For the purpose of evaluation, we gathered only the data required for the given 
test examples. Within a practical machine translation system, the disambiguation mod- 
ule would require a database containing all the syntactic tuples of the corpus with 
their frequency counts. In the current research project we did not have the computing 
resources necessary for constructing the complete database (the major cost being pars- 
ing time). However, such resources are not needed in order to evaluate the proposed 
method. Since we evaluated the method only on a relatively small number of random 
sentences, we first constructed the set of all "relevant" target uples, i.e., tuples that 
should be considered for the test sentences. Then we scanned the entire corpus and 
extracted only sentences that contain both words from at least one of the relevant 
tuples. Only the extracted sentences were parsed, and their counts were recorded in 
our database. Even though this database is much smaller than the full database, for 
the ambiguous words of the test sentences, both databases provide the same informa- 
tion. Thus, the success rate for the test sentences i  the same for both methods, while 
requiring a considerably smaller amount of resources at the research phase. 
The problem with this method is that for every set of sample sentences the entire 
corpus has to be scanned. Thus, a practical system would have to preprocess the 
corpus to construct a database of the entire corpus. Then, to resolve ambiguities, only 
this database need be consulted. 
After acquiring all the relevant data, the algorithm of Section 3.3 was executed for 
each of the test sentences. 
5. Evaluation 
Two measurements, applicability and precision, are used to evaluate the performance of
the algorithm. The applicability (coverage) denotes the proportion of cases for which 
the model performed a selection, i.e., those cases for which the bound B~ passed 
the threshold. The precision denotes the proportion of cases for which the model 
performed a correct selection out of all the applicable cases. 
We compare the precision of our method, which we term TWS (for Target Word 
Selection), with that of the Word Frequencies procedure, which always selects the 
most frequent arget word. In  other words, the Word Frequencies method prefers 
the alternative that has the highest a priori probability of appearing in the target 
language corpus. This naive "straw-man" is less sophisticated than other methods 
suggested in the literature, but it is useful as a common benchmark since it can be 
easily implemented. The success rate of the Word Frequencies procedure can serve as 
a measure for the degree of lexical ambiguity in a given set of examples, and thus 
different methods can be partly compared by their degree of success relative to this 
procedure. 
Out of the 103 ambiguous Hebrew words, for 33 the bound B~ did not pass 
the threshold, achieving an applicability of 68%. The remaining 70 examples were 
distributed according to Table 2. Thus the precision of the statistical model was 91%

(64/70), 1? whereas relying just on Word Frequencies yields 63% (44/70), providing an 
improvement of28%. The table demonstrates that our algorithm corrects 22 erroneous 
decisions of the Word Frequencies method, but makes only 2 errors that the Word 
Frequencies method translates correctly. This implies that with high confidence our 
method greatly improves the Word Frequencies method. 
The number of Hebrew examples i large enough to permit a meaningful analysis 
of the statistical significance of the results. By computing confidence intervals for the 
distribution of proportions, we claim that with 95% confidence our method succeeds 
in at least 86% of the applicable xamples. This means that though the figure of 91% 
might be due to a lucky selection of the random examples, there is only a 5% chance 
that the real figure is less than 86% (for the given domain and corpus). The confidence 
interval was computed as follows: 
p~f~_Z l_c~f~)  64 f-~4 . 6 
-70  1"65V 7?-7-07? - 0"86' 
where a = 0.05 and the variance is estimated by \]~(1 - f))/n. 
With the same confidence, our method improves the Word Frequencies method 
by at least 18% (relative to the actual improvement of28% in the given test set). Let Pl 
be the proportion of cases for which our method succeeds and the Word Frequencies 
method fails (Pl = 22/70) and P2 be the proportion of cases for which the Word 
Frequencies method succeeds and ours fails (P2 = 2/70). The confidence interval is for 
the difference of proportions in multinomial distribution and is computed as follows: 
Pl  - -  P2 (-- lYl - -  P2 -- Z l -o~ v/var(151 - 152)

Out of the 54 ambiguous German words, for 27 the bound B~ did not pass the 
threshold (applicability of 50%). The remaining 27 examples were distributed accord- 
ing to Table 3. Thus, the precision of the statistical model was 78% (21/27), whereas 
10 An a posteriori observation showed that in three of the six errors the selection of the model was 
actually acceptable, and the a priori judgment of the human translator was too restrictive. For example, 
in one of these cases the statistics elected the expression 'to begin the talks,' whereas the human 
translator regarded this expression as incorrect and selected 'to start the talks.' If we consider these 
cases as correct, then there are only three selection errors, getting 96% precision.

relying just on Word Frequencies yields 56% (15/27). Here our method corrected 6
errors of the Word Frequencies method, without causing any new errors. We attribute 
the lower success rate for the German examples to the fact that they were not re- 
stricted to topics that are well represented in the corpus. This poor correspondence 
between the training and testing texts is reflected also by the low precision of the Word 
Frequencies method. This means that the a priori probability of the target words, as 
estimated from the training corpora, provides a very poor prediction of the correct 
selection in the test examples. Relative to the a priori probability, the precision of our 
method is still 22% higher. 
5.1 Addit ional  Results 
Recently, Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch ave implemented a variant of the disam- 
biguation method of the current paper. This variant was developed for evaluating a
method that estimates the probability of word combinations which do not occur in 
the training corpus (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). In this section we quote 
their results, providing additional evidence for the effectiveness of the TWS method. 
The major difference between the TWS method, as presented in this paper, and 
the variant described by Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993), which we term TWS ~, 
is that the latter does not use any parsing for collecting the statistics from the corpus. 
Instead, the counts of syntactic tuples are approximated by counting co-occurrences of 
the given words of the tuple within a short distance in a sentence. The approximation 
takes into account he relative order between the words of the tuple, such that occur- 
rences of a certain syntactic relation are approximated only by word co-occurrences 
that preserve the most frequent word order for that relation (e.g., an adjective precedes 
the noun it modifies). 
The TWS ~ method still assumes that the source sentence to be translated is being 
parsed, in order to identify the words that are syntactically related to an ambiguous 
word. This model is therefore relevant for translation systems that use a parser for the 
source language, but may not have available a robust arget language parser. 
The corpus used for evaluating the TWS' method consists of articles posted to 
the USENET news system. The articles were collected from news groups that discuss 
computer-related topics. The length of the corpus is 8,871,125 words (tokens), and the 
lexicon size (distinct ypes, at the string level) is 95,559. The type of text in this corpus 
is quite noisy, including short and incomplete sentences as well as much irrelevant 
information, such as person and device names. The test set used for the experiment 
consists of 78 Hebrew sentences that were taken out of a book about computers. These 
sentences were processed as described in Section 4, obtaining a set of 269 ambiguous 
Hebrew words. The average number of alternative translations per ambiguous word 
in this set is 5.8, and there are 1.35 correct ranslations.

Out of the 269 ambiguous Hebrew words, for 96 the bound B~ did not pass

distributed according to Table 4. For the words that are covered by the TWS' method, 
the Word Frequencies method has a precision of 71.1% (123/173), whereas the TWS' 
method has a precision of 85.5%(148/173). As can be seen in the table, the TWS' method 
is correct in almost all the cases it disagrees with the Word Frequencies method (28 out 
of 31). The applicability and precision figures in this experiment are somewhat lower 
than those achieved for the Hebrew set in our original evaluation of the TWS method 
(Table 2). We attribute this to the fact that the original results were achieved using 
a parsed corpus, which was about 2.5 times larger and of much higher quality than 
the one used in the second experiment. Yet, the new results give additional support 
for the usefulness of the TWS method, even for noisy data provided by a low quality 
corpus, without any parsing or tagging, u 
6. Analysis and Possible Enhancements 
In this section we give a detailed analysis of the selections performed by the algorithm 
and, in particular, analyze the cases when it failed. The analysis of these modes sug- 
gests possible improvements of the model and indicates its limitations. As described 
earlier, the algorithm's failure includes either the cases for which the method was not 
applicable (no selection), or the cases for which it made an incorrect selection. The 
following paragraphs list various reasons for both types. At the end of the section, we 
discuss the possibility of adapting our approach to monolingual pplications. 
6.1 Correct Selection 
In the cases that were treated correctly by our method, such as the examples given in 
the previous ections, the statistics ucceeded in capturing two major types of disam- 
biguating data. In preferring 'sign-treaty' upon 'seal-treaty' (in Example 1), the statis- 
tics reflect he relevant semantic onstraint. In preferring 'peace-treaty' upon 'peace- 
contract,' the statistics reflect he lexical usage of 'treaty' in English which differs from 
the usage of 'contract.' 
6.2 Inapplicability 
6.2.1 Insufficient Data. This was the reason for nearly all the cases of inapplicability. 
In one of our examples, for instance, none of the alternative relations, 'an investiga- 
tor of corruption' (the correct one) or 'researcher of corruption' (the incorrect one), 
11 It should be mentioned that the work of Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993) includes further 
results, evaluating an enhancement of the TWS method using their similarity-based stimation method. 
This enhancement is beyond the scope of the current paper and is referred to in the next section. 
581 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
was observed in the parsed corpus. In this case it is possible to perform the correct 
selection if we used only statistics about the co-occurrence of 'corruption' with either 
'investigator' or 'researcher' in the same local context, without requiring any syntactic 
relation. Statistics on co-occurrence of words in a local context were used recently for 
monolingual word sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b, 1993; 
Sch6tze 1992, 1993) (see Section 7 for more details and Church and Hanks 1990; Smadja 
1993, for other applications of these statistics). It is possible to apply these methods 
using statistics of the target language and thus incorporate them within the frame- 
work proposed here for target word selection. Finding an optimal way of combining 
the different methods is a subject for further esearch. Our intuition, though, as well 
as some of our initial data, suggests that statistics on word co-occurrence in the local 
context can substantially increase the applicability of the selection method. 
Another way to deal with the lack of statistical data for the specific words in 
question is to use statistics about similar words. This is the basis for Sadler's Ana- 
logical Semantics (Sadler 1989), which according to his report has not proved effective. 
His results may be improved if more sophisticated methods and larger corpora are 
used to establish similarity between words (such as in Hindle 1990). In particular, an 
enhancement of our disambiguation method, using similarity-based stimation (Da- 
gan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993), was evaluated recently. In this evaluation the 
applicability of the disambiguation method was increased by 15%, with only a slight 
decrease in the precision. The increased applicability was achieved by disambiguating 
additional cases in which statistical data were not available for any of the alternative 
tuples, whereas data were available for other tuples containing similar words. 
6.2.2 Conflicting Data. In very few cases two alternatives were supported equally 
by the statistical data, thus preventing a selection. In such cases, both alternatives 
are valid at the independent level of the syntactic relation, but may be inappropriate 
for the specific context. For instance, the two alternatives of 'to take a job' or 'to 
take a position' appeared in one of the examples, but since the general context was 
about the position of a prime minister, only the latter was appropriate. To resolve 
such ambiguities, it may be useful to consider also co-occurrences of the ambiguous 
word with other words in the broader context (e.g., Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993; 
Yarkowsky 1992). For instance, the word 'minister' seems to co-occur in the same 
context more frequently with 'position' than with 'job.' 
In another example both alternatives were appropriate also for the specific ontext. 
This happened with the German verb werfen, which may be translated (among other 
options) as 'throw,' cast,' or 'score.' In our example, werfen, appeared in the context 
of 'to throw/cast light,' and these two correct alternatives had equal frequencies in 
the corpus ('score' was successfully eliminated): In such situations any selection be- 
tween the alternatives will be appropriate, and therefore, any algorithm that handles 
conflicting data would work properly. However, it is difficult to decide automatically 
when both alternatives are acceptable and when only one of them is. 
6.3 Incorrect Selection 
6.3.1 Using an Inappropriate Relation. One of the examples contained the Hebrew 
word matzav. This word has several translations, two of which are 'state' and 'position.' 
The phrase that contained this word was 'to put an end to the {statelposition } of war'. 
The ambiguous word is involved in two syntactic relations, being a complement of
'put' and also modified by 'war'. The corresponding frequencies were 
582 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
(15) (verb-comp: put-position) 320 
(verb-comp: put-state) 18 
(noun-nobj: state-war) 13 
(noun-nobj: position-war) 2 
The bound of the odds ratio (B~) for the first relation was higher than for the sec- 
ond, and therefore, this relation determined the translation as 'position'. However, the 
correct ranslation should be 'state', as determined by the second relation. 
These data suggest that while ordering the relations (or using any other Weighting 
mechanism) it may be necessary to give different weights to the different ypes of 
syntactic relations. For instance, it seems reasonable that the object of a noun should 
receive greater weight in selecting the noun's sense than the verb for which this noun 
serves as a complement. 
Further examination of the example suggests another efinement of our method: 
it turns out that most of the 320 instances of the tuple (verb-comp: put position) in- 
clude the preposition 'in,' as part of the common phrase 'put in a position.' Therefore, 
these instances should not be considered for the current example, which includes the 
preposition 'to.' However, the distinction between different prepositions was lost by 
our program, as a result of using equivalence classes of syntactic tuples (see Sec- 
tion 2.3). This suggests that we should not use an equivalence class when there is 
enough statistical data for specific tuples. 12 
6.3.2 Confusing Senses. In another example, the Hebrew adjective qatann modified 
the noun sikkuy, which means 'prospect' or 'chance.' The word qatann has several 
translations, two of which are 'small' and 'young.' In this Hebrew word combination, 
the correct sense of qatann is necessarily 'small.' However, the relation that was ob- 
served in the corpus was 'young prospect,' relating to the human sense of 'prospect' 
that appeared in sports articles (a promising young person). This borrowed sense of 
'prospect' is necessarily inappropriate, since in Hebrew it is represented by the equiv- 
alent of 'hope' (tiqwa) and not by sikkuy. 
The source of this problem is Assumption 3: a target uple T might be a translation 
of several source tuples, and while gathering statistics for T, we cannot distinguish 
between the different sources, since we use only a target language corpus. 
A possible solution is to use an aligned bilingual corpus, as suggested by Sadler 
(1989), Brown et al (1991), and Gale et al (1992a). In such a corpus the occurrences of
the relation 'young prospect' will be aligned to the corresponding occurrences of the 
Hebrew word tiqwa and will not be used when the Hebrew word sikkuy is involved. 
Yet, it should be brought o mind that an aligned corpus is the result of manual transla- 
tion, which can be viewed as including amanual tagging of the ambiguous words with 
their equivalent senses in the target language. This resource is much more expensive 
and less available than an untagged monolingual corpus, and it seems to be neces- 
sary only for relatively rare situations. Therefore, considering the trade-off between 
applicability and precision, it seems better to rely on a significantly larger monolin- 
gual corpus than on a smaller bilingual corpus. An optimal method may exploit both 
types of corpora, in which the somewhat more accurate, but more expensive, data of 
a bilingual corpus are augmented by the data of a much larger monolingual corpus. 13 
12 We thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting this point. 
13 Even though there are large quantities of translated texts, experience has shown that it is much harder 
to obtain large bilingual corpora than large monolingual corpora. As mentioned earlier, a bilingual

6.3.3 Lack of Deep Understanding. By their nature, statistical methods rely on large 
quantities of shallow information. Thus, they are doomed to fail when disambiguation 
can rely only on deep understanding of the text and no other surface cues are available. 
This happened in one of the Hebrew examples, in which the two alternatives were 
either 'emigration law' or 'immigration law' (the Hebrew word hagira is used for both 
subsenses). While the context indicated that the first alternative is correct (emigration 
from the Soviet Union), the statistics (which were extracted from texts related to North 
America) preferred the second alternative. To translate the above phrase, the program 
would need deep knowledge, to an extent hat seems to far exceed the capabilities of 
current systems. Fortunately, our results uggest that such cases are quite rare. 
6.4 Monolingual Applications 
The results of our experiments in the context of machine translation suggest the util- 
ity of a similar mechanism even for in word sense disambiguation within a single 
language. To select he right sense of a word, in a broad coverage application, it is 
useful to identify lexical relations between word senses. However, within corpora of 
a single language it is possible to identify automatically only relations at the word 
level, which are, of course, not useful for selecting word senses in that language. This 
is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping 
between words and word senses varies significantly between different languages. For 
instance, the English words 'sign' and 'seal' (from Example 1 in the introduction) cor- 
respond to two distinct senses of the Hebrew word lahtom. These senses hould be 
distinguished by most applications of Hebrew understanding programs. To make this 
distinction, it is possible to perform the same process that is performed for target word 
selection, by producing all the English alternatives for the lexical relations involving 
lahtom. Then the Hebrew sense that corresponds to the most plausible English lexical 
relations is preferred. This process requires a bilingual lexicon that maps each Hebrew 
sense separately into its possible translations, imilar to a Hebrew-Hebrew-English 
lexicon (analogous to the Oxford English-English-Hebrew dictionary of Hornby et al 
\[1986\], which lists the senses of an English word, along with the possible Hebrew 
translations for each of them). 
In some cases, different senses of a Hebrew word map to the same word also in 
English. In these cases, the lexical relations of each sense cannot be identified in an 
English corpus, and a third language is required to distinguish among these senses. 
Alternatively, it is possible to combine our method with other disambiguation meth- 
ods that have been developed in a monolingual context (see the next section). As a 
long-term vision, one can imagine a multilingual corpora-based environment, which 
exploits the differences between languages to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge 
about word senses. 
7. Comparative Analysis of Statistical Sense Disambiguation Methods 
Until recently, word sense disambiguation seemed to be a problem for which there 
is no satisfactory solution for broad coverage applications. Recently, several statisti- 
cal methods have been developed for solving this problem, suggesting the possibility 
of robust, yet feasible, disambiguation. I  this section we identify and analyze basic 
aspects of a statistical sense disambiguation method and compare several proposed 
corpus of moderate size can be valuable when constructing a bil ingual lexicon, thus justifying the 
effort of maintaining such a corpus.

methods (including ours) along these aspects. TM This analysis may be useful for future 
research on sense disambiguation, as well as for the development of sense disam- 
biguation modules in practical systems. The basic aspects that will be reviewed are 
.

4. 
Information sources used by the disambiguation method. 
Acquisition of the required information from training texts. 
The computational decision model. 
Performance evaluation. 
The first three aspects deal with the components ofa disambiguation method, as would 
be implemented for a practical application. The fourth is a methodological issue, which 
is relevant for developing, testing, and comparing disambiguation methods. 
7.1 Information Sources 
We identify three major types of information that were used in statistical methods for 
sense disambiguation: 
. 
. 
3. 
Words appearing in the local, syntactically related, context of the 
ambiguous word. 
Words appearing in the global context of the ambiguous word. 
Probabilistic syntactic and morphological characteristics of the 
ambiguous word. 
The first type of information is the one used in the current paper, in which words 
that are syntactically related to an ambiguous word are used to indicate its most 
probable sense. Statistical data on the co-occurrence of syntactically related words with 
each of the alternative senses reflect semantic and lexical preferences and constraints 
of these senses. In addition, these statistics may provide information about the topics 
of discourse that are typical for each sense. 
Ideally, the syntactic relations between words should be identified using a syntac- 
tic parser, in both the training and the disambiguation phases. Since robust syntactic 
parsers are not widely available, and those that exist are not always accurate, it is pos- 
sible to use various approximations to identify relevant syntactic relations between 
words. Hearst (1991) uses a stochastic part of speech tagger and a simple scheme for 
partial parsing of short phrases. The structures achieved by this analysis are used to 
identify approximated syntactic relations between words. Brown et al (1991) make 
even weaker approximations, using only a stochastic part of speech tagger, and defin- 
ing relations uch as "the first verb to the right" or "the first noun to the left." Finally, 
Dagan et al (1993) (see Section 5.1) assume full parsing at the disambiguation phase, 
but no preprocessing at the training phase, in which a higher level of noise can be 
accommodated. 
A second type of information is provided by words that occur in the global con- 
text of the ambiguous word (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b, 1993; Yarowsky 1992; 
Sch6tze 1992). Gale et al and Yarowsky use words that appear within 50 words in each 
14 The reader is referred to some of these recent papers for thorough surveys of work on sense 
disambiguation (Hearst 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992a; Yarowsky 1992). 
585 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
direction of the ambiguous word. is Statistical data are stored about the occurrence of 
words in the context of each sense and are matched against the context in the dis- 
ambiguated sentence. Co-occurrence in the global context provides information about 
typical topics associated with each sense, in which a topic is represented by words that 
commonly occur in it. Schiitze (1992, 1993) uses a variant of this type of information, 
in which contextvectors are maintained for character four-grams, instead of words. 
In addition, the context of an occurrence of an ambiguous word is represented by 
co-occurrence information of a second order, as a set of context vectors (instead of a 
set of context words). 
Compared with co-occurrence within syntactic relations, information about the 
global context is less sensitive to fine semantic and lexical distinctions and is less 
useful when different senses of a word appear in similar contexts. On the other hand, 
the global context contains more words and is therefore more likely to provide enough 
disambiguating information, in cases in which this distinction can be based ~on the topic 
of discourse. From a general perspective, these two types of information represent a 
common trade-off in statistical language processing: the first type is related to a limited 
amount of deeper, and more precise linguistic information, whereas the second type 
provides a large amount of shallow information, which can be applied in a more 
robust manner. The two sources of information seem to complement each other and 
may both be combined in future disambiguation methods. 16 
Hearst (1991) incorporates a third type of statistical information to distinguish 
between different senses of nouns (in addition to the first type discussed above). 
For each occurrence of a sense, several syntactic and morphological characteristics are 
recorded, such as whether the noun modifies or is modified by another word, whether 
it is capitalized, and whether it is related to certain prepositional phrases. Then, in the 
disambiguation phase, a best match is sought between the information recorded for 
each sense and the syntactic ontext of the current occurrence of the noun. This type 
of information resembles the information that is defined for lexical items in lexicalist 
approaches for grammars, such as possible subcategorization frames of a word. The 
major difference is that Hearst captures probabilistic preferences of senses for such 
syntactic onstructs. Grammatical formalisms, on the other hand, usually specify only 
which constructs are possible and at most distinguish between optional and obliga- 
tory ones. Therefore the information recorded in such grammars cannot distinguish 
between different senses of a word that potentially have the same subcategorization 
frames, though in practice each sense might have different probabilistic preferences 
for different syntactic onstructs. 
It is clear that each of the different ypes of information provides some informa- 
tion that is not captured by the others. However, as the acquisition and manipulation 
of each type of information requires different ools and resources, it is important o 
assess the relative contribution, and the "cost effectiveness," of each of them. Such 
comparative valuations are not available yet, not even for systems that incorporate 
several types of data (e.g., McRoy 1992). Further research is therefore needed to com- 
15 The size of the context was determined experimentally, based on evaluations ofdifferent sizes of 
context. This optimization was performed for the Hansard corpus of the proceedings ofthe Canadian 
Parliament. In general, the size of the global context depends on the corpus and typically consists of a 
homogeneous nit of discourse. 
16 See also Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b (pp. 58-59), and Sch~itze, 1992, 1993, for methods of 
reducing the number of parameters when using global contexts and Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 
1993, for increasing the applicability of the use of local context, in cases in which there is no direct 
statistical evidence.

pare the relative importance of different information types and to find optimal ways 
of combining them. 
7.2 Acquisition of Training Information 
When training a statistical model for sense disambiguation, it is necessary to associate 
the acquired statistics with word senses. This seems to require manual tagging of the 
training corpus with the appropriate sense for each occurrence ofan ambiguous word. 
A similar approach is being used for stochastic part of speech taggers and probabilistic 
parsers, relying on the availability of large, manually tagged (or parsed), corpora for 
training. However, this approach is less feasible for sense disambiguation, for two 
reasons. First, the size of corpora required to acquire sufficient statistics on lexical co- 
occurrence is usually much larger than that used for acquiring statistics on syntactic 
constructs or sequences of parts of speech. Second, lexical co-occurrence patterns, as 
well as the definition of senses, may vary a great deal across different domains of 
discourse. Consequently, it is usually not sufficient o acquire the statistics from one 
widely available "balanced" corpus, as is common for syntactic applications. A sense 
disambiguation model should be trained on the same type of texts for which it will 
be applied, thus increasing the cost of manual tagging. 
The need to disambiguate a training corpus before acquiring a statistical model for 
disambiguation is often termed as the circularity problem. In the following paragraphs 
we discuss different methods that were proposed to overcome the circularity problem, 
without exhaustive manual tagging of the training corpus. In our opinion, this is the 
most critical issue in developing feasible sense disambiguation methods. 
7.2.1 Bootstrapping. Bootstrapping, which is a general scheme for reducing the amount 
of manual tagging, was proposed also for sense disambiguation (Hearst 1991). The idea 
is to tag manually an initial set of occurrences for each sense in the lexicon, acquiring 
initial training statistics from these instances. Then, using these statistics, the system 
tries to disambiguate additional occurrences of ambiguous words. If such an occur- 
rence can be disambiguated automatically with high confidence, the system acquires 
additional statistics from this occurrence, as if it were tagged by hand. Hopefully, the 
system will incrementally acquire all the relevant statistics, demanding just a small 
amount of manual tagging. The results of Hearst (1991) show that at least 10 occur- 
rences of each sense have to be tagged by hand, and in most cases 20-30 occurrences 
are required to get high precision. These results, which were achieved for a small set 
of preselected ambiguous words, suggest hat the cost of the bootstrapping approach 
is still very high. 
7.2.2 Clustering Occurrences of an Ambiguous Word. Sch6tze (1992, 1993) proposes a 
method that can be viewed as an efficient way of manual tagging. Instead of presenting 
all occurrences ofan ambiguous word to a human, these occurrences are first clustered 
using automatic lustering algorithms. 17Then a human is asked to assign one of the 
senses of the word to each cluster, by observing several members of the cluster. Each 
sense is thus represented by one or more clusters. At the disambiguation phase, a new 
occurrence of an ambiguous word is matched against he contexts that were recorded 
for these clusters, selecting the sense of that cluster which provides the best match. 
It is interesting to note that the number of occurrences that had to be observed by 
a human in the experiments of Sch/itze is of the same order as in the bootstrapping 
17 Each occurrence is represented as a context vector, and the vectors are then clustered, 
587 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
approach: 10-20 members of a cluster were observed, with an average of 2.8 clusters 
per sense. As both approaches were tested only on a small number of preselected 
words, further evaluation is necessary to predict he actual cost of their application to 
broad domains. The methods described below, on the other hand, rely on resources 
that were already available on a large scale, and it is therefore possible to estimate the 
expected cost of their broad application. 
7.2.3 Word Classification. Yarowsky (1992) proposes a method that completely avoids 
manual tagging of the training corpus. This is achieved by estimating parameters 
for classes of words rather than for individual word senses. In his work, Yarowsky 
considered the semantic ategories defined in Roget's Thesaurus as classes. He then 
mapped (manually) each of the senses of an ambiguous word to one or several of 
the categories under which this word is listed in the thesaurus. The task of sense 
disambiguation thus becomes the task of selecting the appropriate category for each 
occurrence of an ambiguous word. 18 
When estimating the parameters of a category/9 any occurrence of a word that be- 
longs to that category is counted as an occurrence of the category. This means that each 
occurrence of an ambiguous word is counted as an occurrence of all the categories to 
which the word belongs and not just the category that corresponds to the specific oc- 
currence. A substantial mount of noise is introduced by this training method, which 
is a consequence of the circularity problem. To avoid the noise, it would be neces- 
sary to tag each occurrence of an ambiguous word with the appropriate category. As 
explained by Yarowsky, however, this noise can usually be tolerated. The "correct" 
parameters of a certain class are acquired from all its occurrences, whereas the "in- 
correct" parameters are distributed through occurrences of many different classes and 
usually do not produce statistically significant patterns. To reduce the noise further, 
Yarowsky uses a system of weights that assigns lower weights to frequent words, since 
such words may introduce more noise. 2? The word class method thus overcomes the 
circularity problem by mapping word senses to classes of words. However, because of 
this mapping, the method cannot distinguish between senses that belong to the same 
class, and it also introduces ome level of noise. 
7.2.4 A Bilingual Corpus. Brown et al (1991) were concerned with sense disambigua- 
tion for machine translation. Having a large aligned bilingual corpus available, they 
noticed that the target word which corresponds to an occurrence of an ambiguous 
source word can serve as a tag of the appropriate sense. This kind of tagging provides 
sense distinctions when different senses of a source word translate to different arget 
words. For the purpose of translation, these are exactly the cases for which sense dis- 
tinction is required. Conceptually, the use of a bilingual corpus does not eliminate (or 
reduce) manual tagging of the training corpus. Such a corpus is a result of manual 
translation, and it is the translator who provides tagging of senses as a side effect of 
the translation process. Practically, whenever a bilingual corpus is available, it pro- 
18 In some cases, the Roget index was found to be incomplete, and a missing category had to be added to 
the list of possibilities for a word. 
19 Yarowsky uses statistics on occurrences of specific words in the global context of the category, but the 
method can be used to collect other types of statistics, such as the co-occurrence of the category with 
other categories. 
20 The method of acquiring parameters from ambiguous occurrences in a corpus, relying on the 
"spreading" of noise, can be used in many  contexts. For example, it was used for acquiring statistics 
for d isambiguat ing prepositional phrase attachments, counting ambiguous occurrences of prepositional 
phrases as representing both noun-pp  and verb-pp constructs (Hindle and Rooth 1991). 
588 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
vides a useful source of a sense tagged corpus. Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a) 
have also exploited this resource for achieving large amounts of testing and training 
materials. 
7.2.5 A Bilingual Lexicon and a Monolingual Corpus. The method of the current pa- 
per also exploits the fact that different senses of a word are usually mapped to different 
words in another language. However, our work shows that the differences between 
languages enable us to avoid any form of manual tagging of the corpus (including 
translation). This is achieved by a bilingual exicon that maps a source language word 
to all its possible equivalents in the target language. This approach as practical ad- 
vantages for the purpose of machine translation, in which a bilingual exicon needs 
to be constructed in any case, and very large bilingual corpora are not usually avail- 
able. From a theoretical point of view, the difference between the two methods can be 
made clear if we assume that the bilingual lexicon contains exactly all the different 
translations of a word which occur in a bilingual corpus. For a given set of senses that 
need to be disambiguated, our method requires a bilingual corpus of size k, in which 
each sense occurs at least once, in order to establish its mapping to a target word. In 
addition, a larger monolingual corpus, of size n, is required, to provide enough train- 
ing examples of typical contexts for each sense. On the other hand, using a bilingual 
corpus for training the disambiguation model would require a bilingual corpus of size 
n, which is significantly larger than k. The savings in resources i achieved since the 
mapping between the languages i done at the level of single words. The larger amount 
of information about word combinations, on the other hand, is acquired from an un- 
tagged monolingual corpus, after the mapping has been performed. Our results show 
that the precision of the selection algorithm is high despite the additional noise which 
is introduced by mapping single words independently of their context. As mentioned 
in Section 6.3, an optimal method may combine the two methods. 
In some sense, the use of a bilingual lexicon resembles the use of a thesaurus 
in Yarowsky's approach. Both rely on a manually established mapping of senses to 
other concepts (classes of words or words in another language) and collect information 
about the target concepts from an untagged corpus. In both cases, ambiguous words 
in the corpus introduce some level of noise: counting an occurrence of a word as an 
occurrence of all the classes to which it belongs, or counting an occurrence of a target 
word as an occurrence of all the source words to which it may correspond (a smaller 
amount of noise is introduced in the latter case, as a mapping to target words is much 
more finely grained than a mapping to Roget's categories). Also, both methods can 
distinguish only between senses that are distinguished by the mappings they use: ei- 
ther senses that belong to different classes, or senses that correspond to different target 
words. An interesting difference, though, relates to the feasibility of implementing the 
two methods for a new domain of texts (in particular technical domains). The con- 
struction of a bilingual exicon for a new domain is relatively straightforward and is 
often carried out for translation purposes. The construction of an appropriate classifi- 
cation for the words of a new domain is more complex, and furthermore, it is not clear 
whether it is possible in every domain to construct a classification that is sufficient for 
the purpose of sense disambiguation. 
7.3 The Computational Decision Model 
Sense disambiguation methods require a decision model that evaluates the relevant 
statistics. Sense disambiguation thus resembles many other decision tasks, and not 
surprisingly, several common decision algorithms were employed in different works. 
These include a Bayesian classifier (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993) and a distance 
589 
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 
metric between vectors (Schiitze 1993), both inspired from methods in information 
retrieval; the use of the flip-flop algorithm for ordering possible informants about he 
preferred sense, trying to maximize the mutual information between the informant 
and the ambiguous word (Brown et al 1991); and the use of confidence intervals to 
establish the degree of confidence in a certain preference, combined with a constraint 
propagation algorithm (the current paper). At the present stage of research on sense 
disambiguation, it is difficult to judge whether a certain decision algorithm is signifi- 
cantly superior to others. 21 Yet, these decision models can be characterized by several 
criteria, which clarify the similarities and differences between them. As will be ex- 
plained below, many of the differences are correlated with the different information 
sources employed by these models. 
? Combining several informants: The methods described by Brown et al 
(1991) and in the current paper combine several informants (i.e., statistics 
about several context words) by choosing the informant that seems most 
indicative for the selection. The effect of other, less significant, informants 
is then discarded. The Bayesian classifier and the vector distance metric 
combine all informants simultaneously, in a multiplicative or additive 
manner, possibly assigning a certain weight to each informant. 
? Reducing the number of parameters: Since sense disambiguation relies 
on statistics about lexical co-occurrence, the number of relevant 
parameters i  very high, especially when co-occurrence in the global 
context is considered. For this reason, Schiitze uses two compaction 
methods: First, 5000 "informative" four-grams are used instead of words. 
Second, the 5000 dimensions are decomposed to97 dimensions, using 
singular value decomposition. This method reduces the number of 
parameters significantly, but has the disadvantage that it is impossible to 
trace the meaning of the entries in the resulting vectors or to associate 
them directly with the original co-occurrence statistics. Gale, Church, 
and Yarowsky (1992b, pp. 58-59) propose another approach and reduce 
the number of parameters by selecting the most informative context 
words for each sense. The selection of context words is based on a 
theoretically motivated criterion, borrowed from Mosteller and Wallace 
(1964, pp. 55-56). Finally, Yarowsky's method further educes the 
number of parameters, asit records co-occurrences between individual 
words and word classes. 
? Statistical significance of the selection: In the current paper, we use 
confidence intervals to test whether the statistical preference for a certain 
sense is significant. In a simple multiplicative preference score, on the 
other hand, it is not possible to distinguish whether preferences rely on 
small or large counts. The method of Gale et al remedies this problem 
indirectly (in most cases) by introducing a sophisticated interpolation 
between the actual counts of the co-occurrence parameters and the 
frequency counts of the individual words (see Gale, Church, and 
Yarowsky 1993, for details). In Schiitze's method it is not possible to 
trace the statistical significance of the parameters since they are the result 
of extensive processing and compaction of the original statistical data. 
21 Once the important information sources for sense selection have been identified, it is possible that 
different decision algorithms would achieve comparable r sults. 
590 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
Resolving all ambiguities simultaneously: In the current paper, the 
selection of a sense for one word affects the selection for another word 
through a constraint propagation algorithm. This property is absent in 
most other methods. 
The differences between various disambiguation methods correlate with the dif- 
ference in information sources, in particular, whether they use local or global context. 
When local context is used, only few syntactically related informants may provide re- 
liable information about he selection. It is therefore reasonable tobase the selection on 
only one, the most informative informant, and it is also important to test the statistical 
significance of that informant. The problem of parameter explosion is less severe, and 
the number of parameters i  comparable to that of a bi-gram language model (and 
even smaller). When using the global context, on the other hand, the number of po- 
tential parameters i  significantly larger, but each of them is usually less informative. 
It is therefore important to take into account as many parameters as possible in each 
ambiguous case, but it is less important to test for detailed statistical significance, or 
to worry about the mutual effects of sense selections for adjacent words. 
7.4 Performance Evaluation 
In most of the above-mentioned papers, experimental results are reported for a small 
set of up to 12 preselected words, usually with two or three senses per word. In 
the current paper we have evaluated our method using a random set of example 
sentences, with no a priori selection of the words. This standard evaluation method, 
which is commonly used for other natural language processing tasks, provides adirect 
prediction for the expected success rate of the method when employed in a practical 
application. 
To compare results on different est data, it is useful to compare the precision 
of the disambiguation method with some a priori figure that reflects the degree of 
ambiguity in the text. Reporting the number of senses per example word corresponds 
to the expected success rate of random selection. A more informative figure is the 
success rate of a naive method that always selects the most frequent sense (the Word 
Frequencies method in our evaluations). The success rate of this naive method is higher 
than that of random selection and thus provides a tighter lower bound for the desired 
precision of a proposed isambiguation method. 
An important practical issue in evaluation is how to get the test examples, which 
should be tagged with the correct sense. In most papers (including ours) the tagging 
of the test data was done by hand, which limits the size of the testing set. Preparing 
one test set by hand may still be reasonable, though time consuming. However, it is 
useful to have more than one set, such that results will be reported on a new, unseen, 
set, while another set is used for developing and tuning the system. One useful source 
of tagged examples i  an aligned bilingual corpus, which can be used for testing any 
sense disambiguation method, including methods that do not use bilingual material 
for training. Gale proposes to use "pseudo-words" asanother practical source of test- 
ing examples (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b) (equivalently, Schfitze \[1992\] uses 
"artificial ambiguous words"). Pseudo-words are constructed artificially as a union of 
several different words (say, wl, w2, and w3 define three "senses" of the pseudo-word 
x). The disambiguation method is presented with texts in which all occurrences of 
wl, w2, and w3 are considered as occurrences of x and should then select he original 
word (sense) for each occurrence. Though testing with this method does not provide 
results for real ambiguities that occur in the text, it can be very useful while develop- 
591

ing and tuning the method (Gale shows high correlation between the performance of 
his method on real sense ambiguities and pseudo-words). 
8. Conclusions 
The method presented in this paper takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena, both 
proven to be very useful for sense disambiguation: the different mapping between 
words and word senses among different languages, and the importance of lexical 
co-occurrence within syntactic relations. The first phenomenon provides the solution 
for the circularity problem in acquiring sense disambiguation data. Using a bilingual 
lexicon and a monolingual corpus of the target language, we can acquire statistics on 
word senses automatically, without manual tagging. As explained in Section 7, this 
method has significant practical and theoretical advantages over the use of aligned 
bilingual corpora. We pay for these advantages by introducing an additional evel 
of noise, in mapping individual words independently to the other language. Our 
results show, however, that the precision of the selection algorithm is high despite this 
additional noise. 
This work also emphasizes the importance of lexical co-occurrence within syntac- 
tic relations for the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Co-occurrences found in a large 
corpus reflect a huge amount of semantic knowledge, which was traditionally con- 
structed by hand. Moreover, frequency data for such co-occurrences reflect both lin- 
guistic and domain-specific preferences, thus indicating not only what is possible, but 
also what is probable. It is important o notice that frequency information on lexical 
co-occurrence was found to be much more predictive than single word frequency. In 
the three experiments we reported, there were 61 cases in which the two types of 
information contradicted each other, favoring different arget words. In 56 of these 
cases (92%), it was the most frequent lexical co-occurrence, and not the most frequent 
word, that predicted the correct ranslation. This result may raise relevant hypotheses 
for psycholinguistic research, which has indicated the relevance of word frequencies 
to human sense disambiguation (e.g., Simpson and Burgess 1988). 
We suggest hat the high precision achieved in the experiments relies on two 
characteristics of the ambiguity phenomena, namely the sparseness and redundancy 
of the disambiguating data. By sparseness we mean that within the large space of 
alternative interpretations produced by ambiguous utterances, only a small portion is 
commonly used. Therefore, the chance that an inappropriate interpretation is observed 
in the corpus (in other contexts) is low. Redundancy relates to the fact that different 
informants (such as different lexical relations or deep understanding) tend to support 
rather than contradict one another, and therefore the chance of picking a "wrong" 
informant is low. 
It is interesting to compare our method with some aspects of the statistical machine 
translation system of Brown et al (1990). As mentioned in the introduction, this system 
also incorporates target language statistics in the translation process. To translate a 
French sentence, f, they choose the English sentence, ,that maximizes the term Pr(e) ? 
Pr(f I e). The first factor in this product, which represents the target language model, 
may thus affect any aspect of the translation, including target word selection. 
It seems, however, that Brown et al expect hat target word selection would be 
determined mainly by translation probabilities (the second factor in the above term), 
which should be derived from a bilingual corpus (Brown et al 1990, p. 79). This 
view is reflected also in their elaborate method for target word selection (Brown et al 
1991), in which better estimates of translation probabilities are achieved as a result 
of word sense disambiguation. Our method, on the other hand, incorporates only 
592 
Ido Dagan and Alon Itai Word Sense Disambiguation 
target language probabilities and ignores any notion of translation probabilities. It
thus demonstrates a possible trade-off between these two types of probabilities: using 
more informative statistics of the target language may compensate for the lack of 
translation probabilities. For our system, the more informative statistics are achieved 
by syntactic analysis of both the source and target languages, instead of the simple 
tri-gram model used by Brown et al In a broader sense, this can be viewed as a trade- 
off between the different components of a translation system: having better analysis 
and generation models may reduce some burden from the transfer model. 
In our opinion, the method proposed in this paper may have immediate practical 
value, beyond its theoretical spects. As we argue below, we believe that the method 
is feasible for practical machine translation systems and can provide a cost-effective 
improvement on target word selection methods. The identification of syntactic rela- 
tions in the source sentence is available in any machine translation system that uses 
some form of syntactic parsing. Trivially, a bilingual exicon is available. A parser for 
the target language becomes common in many systems that offer bidirectional transla- 
tion capabilities, requiring parsers for several languages ( ee Miller 1993, for available 
language pairs in several commercial machine translation systems). If a parser for the 
target language corpus is not available, it is possible to approximate he statistics using 
word co-occurrence in a window, as was demonstrated by a variant of our method 
(Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993) (see Section 5.1). In both cases, the statistical 
model was shown to handle successfully the noise produced in automatic acquisition 
of the data. Substantial effort may be required for collecting a sufficiently large tar- 
get language corpus. We have not studied the relation between the corpus size and 
the performance of the algorithm, but it is our impression that a corpus of several 
hundred thousand words will prove useful for translation i  a well-defined omain. 
With current availability of texts in electronic form, = a corpus of this size is feasible 
in many domains. The effort of assembling this corpus should be compared with the 
effort of manually coding sense disambiguation information. Finally, our method was 
evaluated by simulating realistic machine translation lexicons, on randomly selected 
examples, and yielded high performance in two different broad domains (foreign ews 
articles and a software manual). It is therefore xpected that the results reported here 
will be reproduced in other domains and systems. 
To improve the performance of target word selection further, our method may 
be combined with other sense disambiguation methods. As discussed in Section 6.2, 
it is possible to increase the applicability (coverage) of the selection method by con- 
sidering word co-occurrence in a limited context and/or by using similarity-based 
methods that reduce the problem of data sparseness. To a lesser extent, the use of a 
bilingual corpus may further increase the precision of the selection (see Section 6.3). A 
practical strategy may be to use a bilingual corpus for enriching the bilingual lexicon, 
while relying mainly on co-occurrence statistics from a larger monolingual corpus for 
disambiguation. 
In a broader context, his paper promotes the combination ofstatistical nd linguis- 
tic models in natural language processing. It provides an example of how a problem 
can be first defined in detailed linguistic terms, using an implemented linguistic tool 
(a syntactic parser, in our case). Then, having a well-defined linguistic scenario, we 
apply a suitable statistical model to highly informative linguistic structures. According 
to this view, a complex task, such as machine translation, should be first decomposed 
22 Optical character recognition can also be used to acquire relevant exts in electronic form. In this case, 
it may  be necessary to approximate the statistics us ing word co-occurrence in a window, since parsing 
noisy output from optical character recognition is difficult.

on a linguistic basis. Then, appropriate statistical models can be developed for each 
sub-problem. We believe that this approach provides abeneficial compromise b tween 
two extremes innatural language processing: either using linguistic models that ignore 
quantitative information, or using statistical models that are linguistically ignorant.
