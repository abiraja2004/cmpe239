Abstract 
Tills paper describes a computational method for correcting 
users' miseonceptioas concerning the objects modelled by a 
compute," s.ystem. The method involves classifying object-related 
misc,mce|,tions according to the knowledge-base f ature involved 
in the incorrect information. For each resulting class sub-types are 
identified, :.:cording to the structure of the knowledge base, which 
indicate wh:LI i . formativn may be supporting the misconception 
and therefore what information to include in the response. Such a 
characteriza*i,,n, along with a model of what the user knows, 
enables the syst.cm to reas,m in a domain-independent way about 
how best to c~rrv,'t \[he user. 
1. I n t roduct ion  
A meier ar,.a of Al research as been the development of
"expert sys.tcms" - systems which are able to answer user's 
que:~titms concerning a particular domain. Studies identifying 
desirabl,, iutora,'tive capabilities for such systems \[Pollack et al 82\] 
have ft,und that. it is not sufficient simply to allow the user to ,~k 
a question and Itavo the system answ~.r it. Users often want to 
question the system's rea-~oning,to make sure certain constraints 
have been taken into consideration, anti so on. Thus we must 
strive to provide expert systems with the ability to interact with 
the user in the kind of cooperative di:LIogues that we see between 
two bullish ctmversational partners. 
Allowing .,uch interactions between the system and a user 
raises difficulties for a Natural-Language system. Since the user is 
interacting with a system a.s s/he would with a human export, s/he 
will nizam likely exp-ct the system to b(have as a human expert. 
Among other things, the n:.er will expect the systenl to be adhering 
to the cooperative principles of conversation \[Grice 7,5, .loshi 821. 
If these principte~ are not followed by the system, the user is bkeiy 
to become confu~ed. 
In this paper I.focus on one a,;pect of the cooperative 
behavior found between two conversat, ional partners: responding to 
recognized ifferences in the beliefs of the two participants. Often 
when two people interact, ouc reveals-a belief or assumption that 
is incompatible with the b~*liefs held by the other. Failure to 
correct this disparity may not only implicitly confirm the disparate 
bcli,'f, but may even make it impos~;ibie to complete tile ongoing 
task. Imagine the following excilange: 
U. Give ll|e the ItUI.L NO of all Destroyers whose 
MAST_ I IE IG I IT  is above 190. 
E. All Destrt,yers that I know al)out |lave a 
MAbT_HEIG l lT  between 85 and 90. Were you 
thinking of the Aircraft-Carriers? 
in this example, the user (U) ha.s apparently ctmfused a Destroyer 
with an Aircraft-Carrier. This confusion has caused her to 
attr ibute a property value to Destroyers that they do not have. In 
this case a correct a/tswer by the expert (E} of *none" is likely to 
confuse U'. In order to continue the conver.-ation with a minimal 
amount of eoafu.~ion, the user's incorrect belief must first be 
addressed. 
My primary interest is in what an expert system, aspiring to 
human expert performance, should include in such responses. In 
particular, \[ am concerned with system responses to te~'ognized 
disparate beliefs/assumptions about cbflct.~. In the past this 
problem has been h, ft to the tutoring or CAI systems \[Stevens et 
aL 79, Steven~ & ('ollins 80, Brown g:: Burton 78, Sleeman 82\], 
which attetupt o correct student's misconceptions concerning a
particular domain. For the most part, their approach ha.~ been to 
list a priori :dl mi.-conceptions in a given domain. Tile futility t,f 
this appr,~ach is empha'.,ized in \[gleeman ,~2\]. In contrast,the 
approach taken hvre i~ to ,-la:,~iry. in a dolttnin independent way, 
obj,'ct-related di.-pariti,~s ;u:c,~rding to the l'~n.wh'dge ~:tse (l(.I~) 
feature involved. A nund)er of respon:~e strategies :ire associated 
with each resulting cla,~. Deciding which strategy to use for a 
given miseoncepti,m will be determined by analyzing a user model 
and the discourse situation. 
2. What  Goes Into a Correct ion?  
In this work I am making thc btllowing assunlptions: 
? \]:or th*, purposes . f  the initial correct.ion attempt, the 
system is a~umed to have complet,, attd corr~'ct 
knowledge of the domain. Th:tt is. the system will 
initiMly perceive a disparity as a mise.neel,tion on the 
part of the u~er It wi l l thus attempt o bring tile 
user's beli~,fs into line with its own. 
? The system's KB i~tclude-: the following fo:t~trce: an 
object taxonomy, knowledge of object attributes and 
their possible values, and intornlation about I)O.~ible 
relationships between ol)jects. 
? Tile user's KB contains imilar features, llowev,'r, 
mneh of the information (content} in the system's !'(B

In the foi l .wing sections l will discuss the two classes of 
object trii~.conreptions just mentioned: superordinate 
misconceptions and attr ibute misconceptions. Examples of these 
classes :d.ng with correction strategies will be given. In addition, 
indications of how a system might choose a part icular strategy will 
be investigated. 
3. Superordinate Misconceptions 
Si.,.e the information ttmt human experts include in their 
respon~l. Co a ga l . , r . rd inate misc.ncepti,m seems to hinge on the 
exl. .r l 's l,ere~.ption <,f ~ tiw misconception occurred or what  
informati(,n may h:tve bt.cn supporting the misconception, I have 
sub-cat,'g,,rized s,qwrordinate misconct, ptions according to the kind 
of support they hate.  F . r  each type (~ub-category) of 
sup,,r(udinat(, mis,.(,m:,,iJtion, 1 have identified information thal. 
would I." relevant u, the correction. 
In this analysis t,f supf.rordinate misconceptieus, I am 
assulning that the user's knowledge al)out the snperordinate 
concept is correct. The user therefore arrives at the misconception 
because of his/her incomplete understanding of the object. 1 am 
also, for I he moment,  ignoring misconceptions that  occur because 
two objects have similar names. 
Given these restrictions, 1found three major  correction 
strategies used by human experts. These correspond to three 
reasons why u user might misclassify an object: 
TYPE ONE - Object Shares Many Properties with Posited 
Supe~ordinate - This may cause the user wrongly to c .nc lude that  
these shared attr ibutes are inherited from the superordinate. This 
type of misconc,.ption is i l lustrated by an example involving a 
student and a teacher: 4 
U. \] thoughl a whale w.~s a fish. 
E. No, it's a mammal .  Ahhou~h it has fins and li~e~ in the 
water, it's a mamntal  s~nce it is warm blooded and 
feeds its young with milk. 
Nc, tice the expert not only specif i~ the correct s0perordinate, but 
also gives additional inf.rn=ati,~n tt, justify the c~)rre, :i,~n. She 
do~.s this by acknowledging that there are some pr6per~ies that  
whales .d/are with fish which m:O' lead the student to conclude th8% 
a whah: is a fish. At the same time she indicates that these 
pc.pectins are not sufficient, h,r inclusion in the cla.~s of fish. The 
whale, in fact, lia.s other properties which define it to be a 
mamm:d.  
Thus, the strategy the expert uses when s/he perceives the 
misc,,J,ct,ption tu be of TYPE ONE may be characterized as: (I) 
l )e ,y the posited superordinate and iudk:ate the correct one, (2) 
State at tributes (prol>,'rties) that  the obj+ct has in common with 
the posited super<~rdin:tte, (at State defining attr ibutes of the real 
super-r<thmte, thus giviug evidence/justif ication for the correct 
ch,~+:ifi,'~ti.n. The sy, lem may hdlow this strategy when the user 
mod~l indicates that the itser thinks the p++sited suFerordinate and 
the .h i \ ]e l  are simih\]r bee:ruse they share man)' common properties 
{n,,t held by the real SUl~.rordinate). 
TYPE TWO - Objt,ct Shares Properties with Auother Object 
which is a Member of Pos:ited Superordinate - In this c:rse the 
lAhho,Jgh the analysis given hero wa~ d~:rived through ,t~,lying xr~uLI 
human interactions, the exarapDs given ire simply illustrative and have not 
been extrs,,-t~d frorn a real interaetiJn. 
445 
misclassified object and the "other object" are similar because they 
have some other common superordinate. The properties that  they 
share arc no_..~t those inherited from the posited superordinate; but 
those inherited from this other common superordhlate. Figure 
3-1 shows a representation of this situation. OBJECT and 
OTIIEIi-LIBJEC'E have many common properties because they 
slt:.t.re a CtHltllton superordinate (COMMON-St !I'E|2OI2DINATE). 
Hence. if the user knows that  OTI IE I1-OBJECT is a tnember of 
the POSrFED SUPEROl lDINATE,  ~/J|e inay wr~mgly conclude 
that OBJECT is also a member of POSITED :SUI>ERORD1NATE. 
F igure  3-1: TYPE TWO Superordinate Misconeeptio. 
For example, imagine the following exchange taking place i't 
a junior high sch. - I  bioh,gy ela_,~s (here U is a st ,d, .nt ,  E a 
teacher): 
U. I thought a tomato was a vegetable. 
E. No it's a fruit. You may think it's a vegetable since 
you grow tomatoes in your vegetal',\]e garden :?h)ug 
with the lettuce and green beans. However. it's a fruit 
because it's really the ripened ovary of a seed plant. 
Here it is intportant for the student o understand about plants. 
Thus, the teacher denies the posited superordinate, vegetable, and 
gives the corr,-ct one, fruit. She backs this up by refuting evidence 
that  the student may I)e using to support the misconception. In 
this ca...e, the st l .h  nt may wrongly believe that  tomatoes are 
vegetables becau~.e lh~'y are like some other objects which are 
vegetables, lettuce and green beans, in that  all three share the 
common super.rdln:tte: I,l:mts grown in vegetable garden. The 
teacher acknowledges this similarity but refutes the conclusion that  
tomatoes are vegetables by giving the property of tomatoes which 
define them to be fruits. 
The correction strategy used in this case was: (I) Deny the 
chk, csification posited by the user attd indicate the correct 
ela:.,.ifieation. (2) Cite the -t i ler memb~.rs of the posited 
sup*,rordinale that  the user may be either confusing with the 
object being discu.'.sed (Dr makhtg a b:td an:dogy from. (,3) Give the 
features which disling~Jl.h the correct and p~sited superordinates 
thus justifying the classlfi(':ttion. A system may f.l low lt.;s 
strategy if a structure like that ht figure ;3-1 is f(~und in the user 
model. 
TYPE THREE - Wrong Information - The user either has 
been told wrying informal i .n and h.'~ not done any rea;tming to 
justify it, or has tttisclassified the object in response to some 
cotnpl*.x rea.soniug process that  the system can' t  duplicate. In this 
kind of situation, the system, just like a human expert, can only 
c . r tect  the wrong information, give the corresponding true 
information, at . t  possibly give some defining features 
distinguishing the posited and actual  superordiuates. ;f this 
cnrrection does not satisfy the user. it is up to h im/her  to continue 
the interaction until the underlying misconception is ch.ared up 
(see \[.J'eff~rson 72\]). 
The iuformation included in this kind of response is similar 
to that  which McKeown's TEXT system, which answers questions 
about database structure \[McKeown 82 l, would include if the user 
had asked about the diff~.rence between two entities. In her case, 
the information included would depend on how' similar the two 
objects were according to the system KB, not on a model of what  
the user knows or why the user might be asking the question. 5 
U. Is a debenture a secured bond? 
S. No it's an unsecured bond - it has nothing backing it 
should the issuing company default. 
AND 
U. Is the whiskey a missile? 
S. No. it's a submarine which is an underwater  vehicle 
(not a destructive device). 
The strategy folh;wed in these ca..,es can be characterized as: 
(1} Deny posited supev,rdinate and give correct one. (2) Give 
additional iuformathm as lleeded. Tills .xtra inform:ttion may 
include defining features of the correct, superordinate or
information ab .ut  the highest superordinate that  distinguishes the 
object from the posited superordinate. This strategy may be 
followed by the system when there is insufficient evidence in the 
user Ioodel for concI.Jding that  either a TYPE  ONE or a TYPE  
TWO mlsconcepti(m has occurred. 
4. Attribute Misconceptions 
A second class of nlisconception occurs when a person 
wrongly attr ibutes a properly to an object. There are at least 
three reasons wl v thi~, kind of ntisc~mception : ay occur. 
TYPE ()NE - Wren!.; Object - The user is either confusing 
the ob j ,c t  being discussed with :Hmther object that  has the 
specified property,  or s /he is making a b~.t analogy using a similar 
object. In either c.'~e the second object should be included in the 
correfti.:lu SO the problem does not f:,~ulinu?*. 
\[u the foll,)wing example the ,'xpert assume.,~ the user is 
confusiug the object with as imi lar  object. 
U. I have my money in a money market  certif icate so I 
can get to it r ight away. 
E. But you can't!  Your money is tied up in a eertit'icate 
- do you mean a money market  fund? 
The strategy followed in this situation can be characterized 
~.s: ( l )Deny  the wrong information. (2) (; ire the corresp.ml ing 
correct information. (3) Mention the object of confusion or possible 
analogical reas.ning.  This s rategy can I)e followed by a .sy~tenl 
v.'hPit there is at}other obj, 'ct which is "cio~e in con, eel = to Ihe 
object being discussed and zhi,:h ha.- the property involved in the 
inisconceptiou. Or course, the perception of h(,w "cl(.:~e in 
cant'clot =two objects are chan'~.es with conte.\t. This may be 
because some attr ibutes are highlighted in SOlile contexts and 
hidden in others. };'or this reason it is anticipated that a el':sette'~s 
5McKeown do~* indl.-:~te that this kind of inf'~rm:,tlon wou\],i improve her 
re-ponsos. Th- niaior Ihru:~t of her work was ,~n t,,:.i ..trlicture; the tie# of i 
user model could hP eL.aily hltegrilil.d into her t'ri, m.w,-,rk. 
446 
measure such as that described in \[Tversky 77\], which takes into 
account he salience of various attributes, will be useful. 
TYPE TWO - Wrong Attribute - The user has confused the 
attribute being discussed with another attribute. In this case the 
correct attribute should be included in the response along with 
additional information concerning the confused attributes (e.g., 
their similarities and differences). In the following example the 
similarity of the two attributes, in this case a common function, is 
mentioned in the response: 
U. Where are the gills on the whale? 
S. Whales don't have gills, they breathe through lungs. 
The strategy followed was: (1) Deny attribute given, (2) Give 
correct attrihutc, (3) Bring in similarities/differences of the 
attributes which may have led to the confusion. A system may 
follow this strategy when a similar attribute can be found. 
There may be some difficulty in distinguishing between a
TYPE ONE and a TYPE TWO attribute misconception. In some 
situations the user model alone will not be enough to distinguish 
the two cases. The use of past immediate focus (see \[Sidner 83\]) 
looks to be promising in this case. Heuristics are currently being 
worked out for determining the most likely misconception type 
based on what kinds of things {e.g., sets of attributes or objects) 
have been focused on in the recent past. 
TYPE THREE - The user w~s simply given bad information 
or has done some complicated reasoning which can not be 
duplicated by the system. Just as in the TYPE TI~IREE 
superordinate misconception, the system can only respond in a 
limited way. 
U. 1 am not working now and my husband has opened a 
spousal IRA for us. 1 understand that if 1 start 
working again, and want to contribute to my own IRA, 
that we will have to pay a penalty on anything that 
had been in our spousal account. 
E. No - There is no penalty. You can split that spousal 
one any way you wish? You can have 2000 in each. 
Here the strategy is: (1) Deny attribute given, (2) Give correct 
attribute. This strategy can be followed by the system when there 
is not enough evidence in the user model to conclude that either a 
TYPE ONE or a TYPE TWO attribute misconception has 
occurred. 
5. Conclusions 
? In this paper I have argued that any Natural-Language 
system that allows the user to engage in extended ialogues must 
be prepared to handle misconceptions. Through studying various 
transcripts of how people correct misconceptions, I found that they 
not only correct he wrong information, but often include 
additional information to convince the user of the correction 
and/or refute the reasoning that may have led to the 
misconception. This paper describes a framework for allowing a 
computer system to mimic this behavior. 
The approach taken here is first to classify object-related 
misconceptions according to the KB feature involved. For each 
resulting class, sub-types are identified in terms of the structure of 
a KB rather than its content. The sub-types characterize the kind 
of information that may support he misconception. A correction 
strategy is associated with each sub-type that indicates what kind 
of information to include in the response. Finally, algorithms are 
being developed for identifying the type of a particular 
misconception based on a user model and a model of the discourse 
situation.
