Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new approach to
readability assessment with a specific view to
the task of text simplification: the intended
audience includes people with low literacy
skills and/or with mild cognitive impairment.
READ?IT represents the first advanced read-
ability assessment tool for what concerns Ital-
ian, which combines traditional raw text fea-
tures with lexical, morpho-syntactic and syn-
tactic information. In READ?IT readability
assessment is carried out with respect to both
documents and sentences where the latter rep-
resents an important novelty of the proposed
approach creating the prerequisites for align-
ing the readability assessment step with the
text simplification process. READ?IT shows
a high accuracy in the document classification
task and promising results in the sentence clas-
sification scenario.
1 Introduction
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the
exploitation of results from Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) for the development of assistive tech-
nologies. Here, we address this topic by reporting
the first but promising results in the development
of a software architecture for the Italian language
aimed at assisting people with low literacy skills
(both native and foreign speakers) or who have lan-
guage disabilities in reading texts.
Within an information society, where everyone
should be able to access all available information,
improving access to written language is becoming
more and more a central issue. This is the case, for
instance, of administrative and governmental infor-
mation which should be accessible to all members of
the society, including people who have reading dif-
ficulties for different reasons: because of a low edu-
cation level or because of the fact that the language
in question is not their mother tongue, or because
of language disabilities. Health related information
represents another crucial domain which should be
accessible to a large and heterogenous target group.
Understandability in general and readability in par-
ticular is also an important issue for accessing infor-
mation over the web as stated in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) proposed by the
Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C.
In this paper, we describe the approach we devel-
oped for automatically assessing the readability of
newspaper texts with a view to the specific task of
text simplification. The paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the background literature
on the topic; Section 3 introduces the main features
of our approach to readability assessment, with Sec-
tion 4 illustrating its implementation in the READ-
IT prototype; Sections 5 and 6 describe the experi-
mental setting and discuss achieved results.
2 Background
Readability assessment has been a central research
topic for the past 80 years which is still attracting
considerable interest nowadays. Over the last ten
years, within the NLP community the automatic as-
sessment of readability has received increasing at-
tention: if on the one hand the availability of sophis-
ticated NLP technologies makes it possible to moni-
tor a wide variety of factors affecting the readability
73
of a text, on the other hand there is a wide range
of both human- and machine-oriented applications
which can benefit from it.
Traditional readability formulas focus on a lim-
ited set of superficial text features which are taken
as rough approximations of the linguistic factors at
play in readability assessment. For example, the
Flesch-Kincaid measure (the most common reading
difficulty measure still in use, Kincaid (1975)) is a
linear function of the average number of syllables
per word and of the average number of words per
sentence, where the former and latter are used as
simple proxies for lexical and syntactic complexity
respectively. For Italian, there are two readability
formulas: an adaptation of the Flesh-Kincaid for En-
glish to Italian known as the Flesch-Vacca formula
(Franchina and Vacca, 1986); the GulpEase index
(Lucisano and Piemontese, 1988), assessing read-
ability on the basis of the average number of char-
acters per word and the average number of words
per sentence.
A widely acknowledged fact is that all traditional
readability metrics are quick and easy to calculate
but have drawbacks. For example, the use of sen-
tence length as a measure of syntactic complexity as-
sumes that a longer sentence is more grammatically
complex than a shorter one, which is often but not
always the case. Word syllable count is used start-
ing from the assumption that more frequent words
are more likely to have fewer syllables than less fre-
quent ones (an association that is related to Zipf?s
Law, Zipf (1935)); yet, similarly to the previous
case, word length does not necessarily reflects its
difficulty. The unreliability of these metrics has been
experimentally demonstrated by several recent stud-
ies in the field: to mention only a few Si and Callan
(2001), Petersen and Ostendorf (2006), Feng (2009).
On the front of the assessment of the lexical dif-
ficulty of a given text, a first step forward is rep-
resented by vocabulary-based formulas such as the
Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995), using
a combination of average sentence length and word
frequency counts. In particular, for what concerns
the latter it reconstructs the percentage of words
not on a list of 3000 ?easy? words by matching its
own list to the words in the material being evalu-
ated, to determine the appropriate reading level. If
vocabulary-based measures represent an improve-
ment in assessing the readability of texts which was
possible due to the availability of frequency dictio-
naries and reference corpora, they are still unsatis-
factory for what concerns sentence structure.
Over the last ten years, work on readability de-
ployed sophisticated NLP techniques, such as syn-
tactic parsing and statistical language modeling, to
capture more complex linguistic features and used
statistical machine learning to build readability as-
sessment tools. A variety of different NLP-based
approaches to the automatic readability assessment
has been proposed so far, differing with respect to:
a) the typology of features taken into account (e.g.
lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse), and, for each
type, at the level of the inventory of used individual
features; b) the intended audience of the texts under
evaluation, which strongly influences the readability
assessment, and last but not least c) the application
within which readability assessment is carried out.
Interesting alternatives to static vocabulary-based
measures have been put forward by Si and Callan
(2001) who used unigram language models com-
bined with sentence length to capture content in-
formation from scientific web pages, or by Collins-
Thompson and Callan (2004) who adopted a sim-
ilar language modeling approach (Smoothed Uni-
gram model) to predict reading difficulty of short
passages and web documents. These approaches can
be seen as a generalization of the vocabulary-based
approach, aimed at capturing finer-grained and more
flexible information about vocabulary usage. If un-
igram language models help capturing important
content information and variation of word usage,
they do not cover other types of features which are
reported to play a significant role in the assessment
of readability. More recently, the role of syntac-
tic features started being investigated (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al, 2007; Petersen and
Ostendorf, 2009): in these studies syntactic structure
is tracked through a combination of features from n-
gram (trigram, bigram and unigram) language mod-
els and parse trees (parse tree height, number of
noun phrases, verb phrases and subordinated clauses
or SBARs) with more traditional features.
Yet, besides lexical and syntactic complexity fea-
tures there are other important factors, such as the
structure of the text, the definition of discourse topic,
discourse cohesion and coherence and so on, play-
74
ing a central role in determining the reading diffi-
culty of a text. More recent approaches esplored
the role of these features in readability assessment:
this is the case, for instance, of Barzilay and Lap-
ata (2008) or Feng (2010). The last few years have
been characterised by approaches based on the com-
bination of features ranging over different linguistic
levels, namely lexical, syntactic and discourse (see
e.g. Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Kate (2010)).
Another important factor determining the typol-
ogy of features to be considered for assessing read-
ability has to do with the intended audience of
readers: it is commonly agreed that reading ease
does not follow from intrinsic text properties alone,
but it is also affected by the expected audience.
Among the studies addressing readability with re-
spect to specific audiences, it is worth mentioning
here: Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) and Heilman
et al (2007) dealing with language learners, or Feng
(2009) focussing on people with mild intellectual
disabilities. Interestingly,Heilman et al (2007) dif-
ferentiate the typology of used features when ad-
dressing first (L1) or second (L2) language learn-
ers: they argue that grammatical features are more
relevant for L2 than for L1 learners. Feng (2009)
propose a set of cognitively motivated features op-
erating at the discourse level specifically addressing
the cognitive characteristics of the expected users.
When readability is targeted towards adult compe-
tent language users a more prominent role is played
by discourse features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).
Applications which can benefit from an automatic
readability assessment range from the selection of
reading material tailored to varying literacy levels
(e.g. for L1/L2 students or low literacy people)
and the ranking of documents by reading difficulty
(e.g. in returning the results of web queries) to NLP
tasks such as automatic document summarization,
machine translation as well as text simplification.
Again, also the application making use of the read-
ability assessment, which is in turn strictly related to
the intended audience of readers, strongly influences
the typology of features to be taken into account.
Advanced NLP?based readability metrics devel-
oped so far typically deal with English, with a few
attempts devoted to other languages, namely French
(Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), Portuguese
(Aluisio et al, 2010) and German (Bru?ck, 2008).
3 Our Approach
Our approach to readability assessment was devel-
oped with a specific application in mind, i.e. text
simplification, and addresses a specific target audi-
ence of readers, namely people characterised by low
literacy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.
Following the most recent approaches, we treat read-
ability assessment as a classification task: in partic-
ular, given the available corpora for the Italian lan-
guage as well as the type of target audience, we re-
sorted to a binary classification aimed at discerning
easy?to?read textual objects from difficult?to?read
ones. The language dealt with is Italian: to our
knowledge, this is the first attempt of an advanced
methodology for readability assessment for this lan-
guage. Our approach focuses on lexical and syntac-
tic features, whose selection was influenced by the
application, the intended audience and the language
dealt with (both for its intrinsic linguistic features
and for the fact of being a less resourced language).
Following Roark (2007), in the features selection
process we preferred easy-to-identify features which
could be reliably identified within the output of NLP
tools. Last but not least, as already done by Aluisio
et al (2010) the set of selected syntactic features also
includes simplification oriented ones, with the final
aim of aligning the readability assessment step with
the text simplification process.
Another qualifying feature of our approach to
readability assessment consists in the fact that we
are dealing with two types of textual objects: docu-
ments and sentences. The latter represents an impor-
tant novelty of our work since so far most research
focused on readability classification at the document
level (Skory and Eskenazi, 2010). When the tar-
get application is text simplification, we strongly be-
lieve that also assessing readability at the sentence
level could be very useful. We know that methods
developed so far perform well to characterize the
level of an entire document, but they are unreliable
for short texts and thus also for single sentences.
Sentence-based readability assessment thus repre-
sents a further challenge we decided to tackle: in
fact, if all sentences occurring in simplified texts can
be assumed to be easy-to-read sentences, the reverse
does not necessarily hold since not all sentences oc-
curring in complex texts are difficult-to-read sen-
75
tences. Since there are no training data at the sen-
tence level, it becomes difficult ? if not impossible
? to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, i.e.
erroneous readability assessments within the class
of difficult-to-read texts may either correspond to
those easy?to?read sentences occurring within com-
plex texts or represent real classification errors. In
order to overcome this problem in the readability as-
sessment of individual sentences, we introduced a
notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read sen-
tences. In this way, the prerequisites are created for
the integration of the two processes of readability as-
sessment and text simplification. Before, text read-
ability was assessed with respect to the entire doc-
ument and text simplification was carried out at the
sentence level: due to the decoupling of the two pro-
cesses, the impact of simplification operations on the
overall readability level of the text was not always
immediately clear. With sentence-based readability
assessment, this should be no longer a problem.
4 READ?IT
Our approach to readability assessment has been im-
plemented in a software prototype, henceforth re-
ferred to as READ?IT. READ?IT operates on syn-
tactically (i.e. dependency) parsed texts and it as-
signs to each considered reading object - either a
document or a sentence - a score quantifying its
readability. READ?IT is a classifier based on Sup-
port Vector Machines using LIBSVM (Chang and
Lin, 2001) that, given a set of features and a training
corpus, creates a statistical model using the feature
statistics extracted from the training corpus. Such
a model is used in the assessment of readability of
unseen documents and sentences.
The set of features used to build the statistical
model can be parameterized through a configura-
tion file: as we will see, the set of relevant fea-
tures used for readability assessment at the docu-
ment level differs from the those used at the sen-
tence level. This also creates the prerequisites for
specialising the readability assessment measure with
respect to more specific target audiences: as pointed
out in Heilman et al (2007) different types of fea-
tures come into play e.g. when addressing L1 or L2
language learners. Here follows the complete list of
features used in the reported experiments.
4.1 Features
The features used for predicting readability are or-
ganised into four main categories: namely, raw text
features, lexical features as well as morpho-syntactic
and syntactic features. This proposed four?fold par-
tition closely follows the different levels of linguis-
tic analysis automatically carried out on the text be-
ing evaluated, i.e. tokenization, lemmatization, PoS
tagging and dependency parsing. Such a partition
was meant to identify those easy to extract features
with high discriminative power in order to reduce
the linguistic pre-processing of texts guaranteeing at
the same time a reliable readability assessment.
Raw Text Features
They refer to those features typically used within tra-
ditional readability metrics. They include Sentence
Length, calculated as the average number of words
per sentence, and Word Length, calculated as the av-
erage number of characters per words.
Lexical Features
Basic Italian Vocabulary rate features: these fea-
tures refer to the internal composition of the vocab-
ulary of the text. To this end, we took as a refer-
ence resource the Basic Italian Vocabulary by De
Mauro (2000), including a list of 7000 words highly
familiar to native speakers of Italian. In particular,
we calculated two different features corresponding
to: i) the percentage of all unique words (types)
on this reference list (calculated on a per?lemma
basis); ii) the internal distribution of the occurring
basic Italian vocabulary words into the usage clas-
sification classes of ?fundamental words? (very fre-
quent words), ?high usage words? (frequent words)
and ?high availability words? (relatively lower fre-
quency words referring to everyday objects or ac-
tions and thus well known to speakers). Whereas
the latter represents a novel feature in the readability
assessment literature, the former originates from the
Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and, as
implemented here, it can be seen as the complement
of the type out-of-vocabulary rate features used by
Petersen and Ostendorf (2009).
Type/Token Ratio: this feature refers to the ratio
between the number of lexical types and the num-
ber of tokens. This feature, which can be consid-
ered as an indicator of expressive language delay or
76
disorder as shown in Wright (2003) for adults and
in Retherford (2003) for children, has already been
used for readability assessment purposes by Aluisio
et al (2010). Due to its sensitivity to sample size,
this feature has been computed for text samples of
equivalent length.
Morpho?syntactic Features
Language Model probability of Part-Of-Speech
unigrams: this feature is based on a unigram lan-
guage model assuming that the probability of a token
is independent of its context. The model is simply
defined by a list of types (POS) and their individual
probabilities. This feature has already been shown
to be a reliable indicator for automatic readability
assessment (see, for example, Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) and Aluisio et al (2010)).
Lexical density: this feature refers to the ratio of
content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs)
to the total number of lexical tokens in a text. Con-
tent words have already been used for readability as-
sessment by Aluisio et al (2010) and Feng (2010).
Verbal mood: this feature refers to the distribution
of verbs according to their mood. It is a novel and
language?specific feature exploiting the predictive
power of the Italian rich verbal morphology.
Syntactic Features
Unconditional probability of dependency types:
this feature refers to the unconditional probability of
different types of syntactic dependencies (e.g. sub-
ject, direct object, modifier, etc.) and can be seen
as the dependency-based counterpart of the ?phrase
type rate? feature used by Nenkova (2010).
Parse tree depth features: parse tree depth can be
indicative of increased sentence complexity as stated
by, to mention only a few, Yngve (1960), Frazier
(1985) and Gibson (1998). This set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the parse tree
depth and includes the following measures: a) the
depth of the whole parse tree, calculated in terms of
the longest path from the root of the dependency tree
to some leaf; b) the average depth of embedded com-
plement ?chains? governed by a nominal head and
including either prepositional complements or nomi-
nal and adjectival modifiers; c) the probability distri-
bution of embedded complement ?chains? by depth.
The first feature has already been used in syntax-
based readability assessment studies (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al, 2007; Nenkova,
2010); the latter two are reminiscent of the ?head
noun modifiers? feature used by Nenkova (2010).
Verbal predicates features: this set of features cap-
tures different aspects of the behaviour of verbal
predicates. They range from the number of verbal
roots with respect to number of all sentence roots
occurring in a text to their arity. The arity of verbal
predicates is calculated as the number of instanti-
ated dependency links sharing the same verbal head
(covering both arguments and modifiers). Although
there is no obvious relation between the number of
verb dependents and sentence complexity, we be-
lieve that both a low and a high number of depen-
dents can make sentence readability quite complex,
although for different reasons (elliptical construc-
tions in the former case, a high number of modifiers
in the latter). Within this feature set we also con-
sidered the distribution of verbal predicates by arity.
To our knowledge, this set of features has never been
used so far for readability assessment purposes.
Subordination features: subordination is widely
acknowledged to be an index of structural complex-
ity in language. As in Aluisio et al (2010), this set
of features has been introduced here with a specific
view to the text simplification task. A first feature
was meant to measure the distribution of subordi-
nate vs main clauses. For subordinates, we also
considered their relative ordering with respect to
the main clause: according to Miller and Weinert
(1998), sentences containing subordinate clauses in
post?verbal rather than in pre?verbal position are
easier to read. Two further features were intro-
duced to capture the depth of embedded subordinate
clauses since it is a widely acknowledged fact that
highly complex sentences contain deeply embedded
subordinate clauses: in particular, a) the average
depth of ?chains? of embedded subordinate clauses
and b) the probability distribution of embedded sub-
ordinate clauses ?chains? by depth.
Length of dependency links feature: both Lin
(1996) and Gibson (1998) showed that the syntactic
complexity of sentences can be predicted with mea-
sures based on the length of dependency links. This
is also demonstrated in McDonald and Nivre (2007)
who claim that statistical parsers have a drop in ac-
curacy when analysing long dependencies. Here, the
77
dependency length is measured in terms of the words
occurring between the syntactic head and the depen-
dent. This feature is the dependency-based counter-
part of the ?phrase length? feature used for readabil-
ity assessment by Nenkova (2010) and Feng (2010).
5 The Corpora
One challenge in this work was finding an appropri-
ate corpus. Although a possibly large collection of
texts labelled with their target grade level (such as
the Weekly Reader for English) would be ideal, we
are not aware of any such collection that exists for
Italian in electronic form. Instead, to test our ap-
proach to automatically identify the readability of a
given text, we used two different corpora: a news-
paper corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, ?Rep?),
and an easy?to?read newspaper, Due Parole (hence-
forth, ?2Par?) which was specifically written for an
audience of adults with a rudimentary literacy level
or with mild intellectual disabilities. The articles in
2Par were written by Italian linguists expert in text
simplification using a controlled language both at
the lexicon and sentence structure levels (Piemon-
tese, 1996) .
There are different motivations underlying the se-
lection of these two corpora for our study. On the
practical side, to our knowledge 2Par is the only
available corpus of simplified texts addressing a
wide audience characterised by a low literacy level.
So, the use of 2Par represented the only possible op-
tion on the front of simplified texts. For the selection
of the second corpus we opted for texts belonging
to the same class, i.e. newspapers: this was aimed
at avoiding interferences due to textual genre varia-
tion in the measure of text readability. This is con-
firmed by the fact that the two corpora show a sim-
ilar behaviour with respect to a number of different
parameters, which according to the literature on reg-
ister variation (Biber, 2009) are indicative of textual
genre differences: e.g. lexical density, the noun/verb
ratio, the percentage of verbal roots, etc. On the
other hand, the two corpora differ significantly with
respect to the distribution of features typically cor-
related with text complexity, e.g. the composition of
the used vocabulary (e.g. the percentage of words
belonging to the Basic Italian Vocabulary in Rep is
4.14% and in 2Par is 48.04%) or, from the syntactic
point of view, the average parse tree height (which in
Rep is 5.71 and in 2Par 3.67), the average number of
verb phrases per sentence (which in Rep is 2.40 and
in 2Par 1.25), the depth of nested structures (e.g. the
average depth of embedded complement ?chains? in
Rep is 1.44 and in 2Par is 1.30), the proportion of
main vs subordinate clauses (in Rep main and sub-
ordinate clauses represent respectively 65.11% and
34.88% of the cases; in 2Par there is 79.66% of main
clauses and 20.33% of subordinate clauses).
The Rep/2Par pair of corpora is somehow remi-
niscent of corpora used in other readability studies,
such as Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica El-
ementary, but with a main difference: whereas the
English corpora consist of paired original/simplified
texts, which we might define as ?parallel monolin-
gual corpora?, the selected Italian corpora rather
present themselves as ?comparable monolingual
corpora?, without any pairing of the full?simplified
versions of the same article. Comparability is guar-
anteed here by the inclusion of texts belonging to the
same textual genre: we expect such comparable cor-
pora to be usefully exploited for readability assess-
ment because of the emphasis on style over topic.
Although these corpora do not provide an ex-
plicit grade?level ranking for each article, broad
categories are distinguished, namely easy?to?read
vs difficult?to?read texts. The two paired com-
plex/simplified corpora were used to train and test
different language models described in Section 6.
As already pointed out, such a distinction is reliable
in a document classification scenario, while at the
sentence classification level it poses the remarkable
issue of discerning easy?to?read sentences within
difficult?to?read documents (i.e. Rep).
6 Experiments and Results
READ?IT was tested on the 2Par and Rep cor-
pora automatically POS tagged by the Part?Of?
Speech tagger described in Dell?Orletta (2009) and
dependency?parsed by the DeSR parser (Attardi,
2006) using Support Vector Machine as learning al-
gorithm. Three different sets of experiments were
devised to test the performance of READ-IT in the
following subtasks: i) document readability classifi-
cation, ii) sentence readability classification and iii)
detection of easy?to?read sentences within difficult?
78
to?read texts.
For what concerns the document classification
subtask, we used a corpus made up of 638 docu-
ments of which 319 were extracted from 2Par (taken
as representative of the class easy?to?read texts) and
319 from Rep (representing the class of difficult?
to?read texts). We have followed a 5?fold cross?
validation process: the corpus was randomly split
into 5 training and test sets. The test sets consisted
of 20% of the individual documents belonging to the
two considered readability levels, with each docu-
ment being included in one test set only. With re-
gard to the sentence classification subtask, we used a
training set of about 3,000 sentences extracted from
2Par and of about 3,000 sentences from Rep and a
test corpus of 1,000 sentences of which 500 were ex-
tracted from 2Par (hereafter, 2Par test set) and 500
from Rep (hereafter, Rep test set). In the third ex-
periment, readability assessment was carried out by
READ?IT with respect to a much bigger corpus of
2,5 milion of words extracted from the newspaper
La Repubblica (hereafter, Rep 2.5), for a total of
123,171 sentences, with the final aim of detecting
easy?to?read sentences.
All the experiments were carried out using four
different readability models, described as follows:
1. Base Model, using raw text features only;
2. Lexical Model, using a combination of raw
text and lexical features;
3. MorphoS Model: using raw text, lexical and
morpho?syntactic features;
4. Syntax Model: combining all feature types,
namely raw text, lexical, morpho?syntactic and
syntactic features.
Note that in the Lexical and Syntax Models, dif-
ferent sets of features were selected for the subtasks
of document and sentence classification. In particu-
lar, for sentence?based readability assesment we did
not take into account the Type/Token Ratio feature,
all features concerning the distribution of ?chains?
of embedded complements and subordinate clauses
and the distribution of verbal predicates by arity.
Since, to our knowledge, a machine learning read-
ability classifier does not exist for the Italian lan-
guage we consider the Base Model as our baseline:
this can be seen as an approximation of the Gul-
pEase index, which is based on the same raw text
features (i.e. sentence and word length).
6.1 Evaluation Methodology
Different evaluation methods have been defined in
order to assess achieved results in the three afore-
mentioned experiment sets. The performance of
both document and sentence classification experi-
ments have been evaluated in terms of i) overall Ac-
curacy of the system and ii) Precision and Recall.
In particular, Accuracy is a global score referring
to the percentage of documents or sentences cor-
rectly classified, either as easy?to?read or difficult?
to?read objects. Precision and Recall have been
computed with respect to two the target reading lev-
els: in particular, Precision is the ratio of the number
of correctly classified documents or sentences over
the total number of documents and sentences classi-
fied by READ?IT as belonging to the easy?to?read
(i.e. 2Par) or difficult?to?read (i.e. Rep) classes; Re-
call has been computed as the ratio of the number of
correctly classified documents or sentences over the
total number of documents or sentences belonging
to each reading level in the test sets. For each set of
experiments, evaluation was carried out with respect
to the four models of the classifier.
Following from the assumption that 2Par con-
tains only easy?to?read sentences while Rep does
not necessarily contain only difficult?to?read ones,
we consider READ?IT errors in the classification of
2Par sentences as erroneously classified sentences.
On the other hand, classification errors within the
set of Rep sentences deserve an in?depth error anal-
ysis, since we need to discern real errors from mis-
classifications due to the fact that we are in front of
easy?to?read sentences occurring in a difficult?to?
read context. In order discern errors from ?correct?
misclassifications, we introduced a new evaluation
methodology, based on the notion of Euclidean dis-
tance between feature vectors. Each feature vec-
tor is a n?dimensional vector of linguistic features
(see Section 4.1) that represents a set of sentences.
Two vectors with 0 distance represent the same set
of sentences, i.e. those sentences sharing the same
values for the monitored linguistic features. Con-
versely, the bigger the distance between two vectors
is, the more distant are the two represented sets of
79
sentences with respect to the monitored features.
The same notion of distance has also been used
to test which model was more effective in predicting
the readability of n?word long sentences.
6.2 Results
In Table 1, the Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores
achieved with the different READ?IT models in the
document classification subtask are reported. It can
be noticed that the Base Model shows the lowest per-
formance, while the MorphoS Model outperforms
all other models. Interestingly, the Lexical Model
shows a high accuracy for what concerns the doc-
ument classification subtask (95.45%), by signifi-
cantly improving the accuracy score of the Base
Model (about +19%). This result demonstrates that
for assessing the readability of documents a combi-
nation of raw and lexical features provides reliable
results which can be further improved (about +3%)
by also taking into account morpho-syntax.

Table 1: Document classification results
Consider now the sentence classification subtask.
Table 2 shows that in this case the most reliable re-
sults are achieved with the Syntax Model. It is inter-
esting to note that the morpho?syntactic and syntac-
tic features allow a much higher increment in terms
of Accuracy, Precision and Recall scores than in the
document classification scenario: i.e. the difference
between the performance of the Lexical Model and
the best one in the document classification experi-
ment (i.e. the MorphoS Model) is equal to 2.6%,
while in the sentence classification case (i.e. Syntax
Model) is much higher, namely 17% .
In Table 3, we detail the performance of the best
READ?IT model (i.e. the Syntax Model) on the
Rep test set. In order to evaluate those sentences
which were erroneously classified as belonging to
2Par, we calculated the distance between 2Par and i)
these sentences (140 sentences referred to as wrong
in the Table), ii) the correctly classified sentences

Table 2: Sentence classification results
(360 sentences, referred to as correct in the Table),
iii) the whole Rep test set. As we can see, the dis-
tance between the wrong sentences and 2Par is much
lower than the distance holding between 2Par and
the correcly classified sentences (correct). This en-
tails that the sentences which were erroneously clas-
sified as easy?to?read sentences (i.e. belonging to
2Par) are in fact more readable than the correctly
classified ones (as belonging to Rep).It is obvious
that the Rep test set, which contains both correct and
wrong sentences, has an intermediate distance value
with respect to 2Par.

Table 3: Distances between 2Par and Rep on the basis of
the Syntax Model
In Table 4, the percentage of Rep 2.5 sentences
classified as difficult?to?read is reported. The re-
sults show that the Syntax Model classifies the higher
number of sentences as difficult?to?read, but from
these results we cannot say whether this model is the
best one or not since Rep 2.5 sentences are not anno-
tated with readability information. Therefore, in or-
der to compare the performance of the four READ?
IT models and to identify which is the best one, we
computed the distance between the sentences clas-
sified as easy?to?read and 2Par, which is reported,
for each model, in Table 5. It can be noticed that
the Syntax Model appears to be the best one since it
shows the lowest distance with respect to 2Par; on
the other hand, the whole Rep 2.5 corpus shows a
higher distance since it contains both difficult? and
easy?to?read sentences. Obviously, the sentences
classified as difficult?to?read by the Syntax Model
(Diff Syntax in the Table) show the broader distance.

In order to gain an in?depth insight into the
different behaviour of the four READ?IT models,
we evaluated their performances for sentences of a
fixed length. We considered sentences whose length
ranges between 8 and 30. For every set of sentences
of the same legth, we compared the easy?to-read
sentences of Rep 2.5 classified by the four models
with respect to 2Par. In Figure 1, each point rep-
resents the distance between a set of sentences of
the same length and the same n?word long set of
sentences in the 2Par corpus. As it can be seen, the
bottom line which represents the sentences classified
as easy?to?read by the Syntax Model is the closest
to the 2Par sentences of the same length. On the
contrary, the line representing the sentences classi-
fied by the Base Model is the most distant amongst
the four READ?IT models. Interestingly, it over-
laps with the line representing the Rep 2.5 sentences:
this suggests that a classification model based only
on raw text features (i.e. sentence and word length)
is not able to identify easy?to?read sentences if we
consider sets of sentences of a fixed length. Obvi-
ously, the line representing the sentences classified
as difficult?to?read by the Syntax Model shows the
broadest distance. This experiment has shown that
linguistically motivated features (and in particular
syntactic ones) have a fundamental role in the sen-
tence readability assessment subtask.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new approach to read-
ability assessment with a specific view to the task of
text simplification: the intended audience includes
people with low literacy skills and/or with mild cog-
nitive impairment. The main contributions of this
work can be summarised as follows: i) READ?
IT represents the first advanced readability assess-
ment tool for what concerns Italian; ii) it combines
traditional raw text features with lexical, morpho-
syntactic and syntactic information; iii) readability
assessment is carried out with respect to both doc-
uments and sentences. Sentence?based readability
assessment is an important novelty of our approach
which creates the prerequisites for aligning readabil-
ity assessment with text simplification. READ?IT
shows a high accuracy in the document classification
task and promising results in the sentence classifica-
tion scenario. The two different tasks appear to en-
force different requirements at the level of the under-
lying linguistic features. To overcome the lack of an
Italian reference resource annotated with readability
information at the sentence level we introduced the
notion of distance to assess READ?IT performance.
