ABSTRACT 
Natural language xperiments in information retrieval have 
often been inconclusive due to the lack of large text bases 
with associated queries and relevance judgments. This pa- 
per describes experiments in incremental query processing 
and indexing with the INQUERY information retrieval sys- 
tem on the TIPSTER queries and document collection. The 
results measure the value of processing tailored for different 
query styles, use of syntactic tags to produce search phrases, 
recognition and application of generic concepts, and auto- 
matic concept extraction based on interword associations in
a large text  base. 
1. INTRODUCTION:  T IPSTER AND 
INQUERY 
Previous research has suggested that retrieval effective- 
ness might be enhanced by the use of multiple repre- 
sentations and by automated language processing tech- 
niques. Techniques include automatic or interactive in- 
troduction of synonyms \[Har88\], forms-based interfaces 
\[CD90\], automatic recognition of phrases \[CTLgl\], and 
relevance feedback \[SB90\]. The recent development of 
the T IPSTER corpus with associated queries and rel- 
evance judgments has provided new opportunities for 
judging the effectiveness of these techniques on large het- 
erogenous document collections. 
1.1. T IPSTER Text Base and Query 
Topics 
The T IPSTER documents comprise two volumes of text, 
of approximately one gigabyte ach, from sources uch as 
newspaper and magazine articles and government pub- 
lications (Federal Register). Accompanying the collec- 
tions are two sets of fifty topics. Each topic is a full text 
description, in a specific format, of an information eed. 
(Figure 1). 
Each T IPSTER topic offers several representations of
the same information need. The Topic and Descrip- 
tion fields are similar to what might be entered as a 
query in a traditional information retrieval system. The 
Narrative field expands on the information eed, giving 
an overview of the classes of documents which would or

that must be present in relevant documents, for exam- 
ple, the location of the company. The Concepts field lists 
words and phrases which are pertinent o the query. The 
Factors field lists constraints on the geographic and/or 
time frame of the query. All of these fields offer opportu- 
nities for different kinds of natural anguage processing. 
1.2. The INQUERY Information Re- 
trieval System 
INQUERY is a probabilistic information retrieval sys- 
tem based upon a Bayesian inference network model 
\[TC91, Tur91\]. The object network consists of object 
nodes (documents) (o/s)  and concept representation 
nodes (r,~'s). In a typical network information retrieval 
system, the text representation nodes will correspond to 
353 
words extracted from the text \[SM83\], although repre- 
sentations based on more sophisticated language anal- 
ysis are possible. The estimation of the probabilities 
P(rm\[oj) is based on the occurrence frequencies of con- 
cepts in both individual objects and large collections of 
objects. In the INQUERY system, representation nodes 
are the word stems and numbers that occur in the text, 
after stopwords are discarded. 
2. QUERY PROCESSING 
EXPERIMENTS 
Our current set of natural anguage techniques for query 
enhancement are: 
? deletion of potentially misleading text; 
? grouping of proper names and interrelated noun 
phrase concepts; 
? automatic oncept expansion; 
? simple rule-based interactive query modification. 
Future experiments will use more extensive automatic 
noun phrase processing and paragraph level retrieval. 
In addition to the traditional recall/precision table, we 
show tables of the precision for the top n documents 
retrieved, for 5 values of n. The recall/precision table 
measures the ability of the system to retrieve all of the 
documents known to be relevant. The precision for the 
top n documents gives a better measure of what a person 
would experience in using the system. 
2 .1 .  De le t ion  processes .  
Table 1 illustrates an incremental query treatment. The 
(Words)  column shows results from the unprocessed 
words of the query alone. (Formatting information, such 
as field markers, has been removed.) The first active pro- 
cessing (Del l )  removes words and phrases which refer to 
the information retrieval processes rather than the infor- 
mation need, for example, A relevant document will de- 
scribe . . . .  We further remove words and phrases which 
are discursive, like point of view, sort of, discuss, men- 
lion as well as expressions which would require deep in- 
ference to process, such as effects of or purpose of (Fig- 
ure 2). Some of these expressions would be useful in 
other retrieval contexts and different lists would be ap- 
propriate in different domains. An interactive user is 
given feedback regarding deletions and could have the 
capability of selectively preventing deletion. 
In the experiment in the fourth column (-NARIq.) the 
Narrative field has been deleted from each query. Since 
the Narrative field is usually a very abstract discussion of 
the criteria for document relevance, it is not well-suited 
to a system like INQUERY, which relies on matching 
words from the query to words in the document. New 
terms introduced by the Narrative field are rarely useful 
as retrieval terms (but note the small loss in precision at 
the very lowest level of recall). 
2 .2 .  Group ing  Noun Phrases  and  Recog-  
n i z ing  Concepts  
The simplest phrasing or grouping techniques are recog- 
nition of proper noun groups (Caps in Table 1) and 
recognition of multiple spellings for common concepts 
such as United States. 
Prox imi ty  and phrase  operators  for  noun 
phrases .  Simple noun phrase processing is done in two 
ways. Sequences of proper nouns are recognized as 
names and grouped as arguments to a proximity opera- 
tor. The proximity operator equires that its arguments 
appear in strict order in a document, but allows an in- 
terword distance of three or less. Thus a query such as 
George Bush matches George Herbert Walker Bush in a 
document. 
Secondly, the query is passed through a syntactic part of 
speech tagger \[Chu88\], and rules are used rules to iden- 
tify noun phrases (Figure 2). Experiments howed that 
very simple noun phrase rules work better than longer, 
more complex, noun phrases. We believe this is because 
the semantic relationships expressed in associated groups 
of noun phrases in a query may be expressed in a doc- 
ument as a compound noun group, a noun phrase with 
prepositional phrase arguments, a complex sentence, or a 
sequence of sentences linked by anaphora. This hypoth- 
esis is supported by the success of the unordered text 
window operator used in the interactive query modifica- 
tion experiments (Table 4). 
On the other hand, there are verbal "red herrings" in 
some query noun phrases due to overpreclse xpression. 
For example, the phrase U.S. House of Representatives 
would be more effective for retrieval without the U.S. 
component (Congress might be even nicer). 
2 .3 .  Concept  Recogn i t ion  
Cont ro l led  vocabu lary .  The INQUERY system has 
been designed so that it is easy to add optional ob- 
ject types to implement a controlled indexing vocabu- 
lary \[CCH92\]. For example, when a document refers to 
a company by name, the document is indexed both by 
the the company name (words in the text) and the object 
type (~company). The standard INQUERY document 
parsers recognize the names of companies \[Rau91\], coun-

Evaluation Conference (TREC).

tries, and cities in the United States. 
With wide-ranging queries like the TIPSTER topics, we 
have had some success with adding//city (and #foreign- 
country) concepts to queries that request information 
on the location of an event (Table 2). But the terms 
//company and #usa have not yet proved consistently 
useful. The #corapany concept may be used to good ef- 
fect to restrict other operators. For example, looking for 
the terms machine, translation, and #company in an n- 
word text window would give good results with respect o 
companies working on or marketing machine translation 
products. But, the current implementation f the #com- 
pany concept recognizer has some shortcomings which 
are exposed by this set of queries. Our next version of 
the recognizer will be more precise and complete x, and 
we expect significant improvement from these it. 
The #usa term tends to have unexpected effects, be- 
cause a large part of the collection consists of arti- 
cles from U.S. publications. In these documents U.S. 
nationality is often taken for granted (term frequency

ing their  company database  for this purpose. 
of #usa=294408, #foreigneountry=472021), and it is 
likely that it may be mentioned explicitly only when 
that presupposition is violated, or when both U.S. and 
non-U.S, issues are being discussed together in the same 
document. Therefore, because focussing on the #usa 
concept will bring in otherwise irrelevant documents, it 
is more effective to put negative weight on the #foreign- 
country concept where the query interest is restricted 
to U.S. matters. For the same reason, in a query fo- 
cussed only on non-U.S, interests, we would expect the 
opposite: using #foreigncountry should give better per- 
formance than #NOT(#usa}. 
Research continues on the 'right' mix of concept recog- 
nizers for a document collection. In situations where 
text and queries are more predictable, such as commer- 
cial customer support environments, an expanded set of 
special terms and recognizers i  appropriate. Names of 
products and typical operations and objects can be rec- 
ognized and treated specially both at indexing and at 
query time. Our work in this area reveals a significant 
improvement due to domain-specific concept recognizers, 
however, standardized queries and relevance judgments 
are still being developed.

Automat ic  concept  expans ion .  We have promising 
preliminary results for experiments in automatic oncept 
expansion. The Expand results in Table 3 were pro- 
duced by adding five additional concepts to each query. 
The concepts were selected based on their preponder- 
ant association with the query terms in text of the 1987 
Wall Street Journal articles from Volume 1 of the TIP- 
STER corpus. The improvement is modest, and we an- 
ticipate better results from refinements in the selection 
techniques and a larger and more heterogenous sample 
of the corpus.

In the following experiments in interactive query pro-

making the modifications was permitted to 
1. Add words from the Narrative field; 
2. Delete words or phrases from the query; 
3. Specify a text window size for the occurrence of 
words or phrases in the query. 
The third restriction simulates a paragraph-based re- 
trieval.

and (2) only. The Q-O query-set used all three rules. 
The improvement over the results from automatically 
generated queries demonstrates the effectiveness of sim- 
ple user modifications after automatic query processing 
has been performed. The most dramatic improvement 
comes at the top end of the recall scale, which is a highly 
desirable behavior in an interactive system. The results 
also suggest hat, based on the text window simulation, 
paragraph-based retrieval can significantly improve ef- 
fectiveness. 
3. CONCLUSION 
The availability of the large T IPSTER text base and 
query sets has enabled us to undertake a series of exper- 
iments in natural anguage processing of documents and 
queries for information retrieval. We have seen steady 
improvements due to lexical and phrase-level processing 
of natural language queries. Our experiments with in- 
teractive modification of the resulting queries indicate 
how much potential gain there is in this area, provided 
we can refine our phrasing and selection criteria, and 
provided actual paragraph retrieval is at least as good 
as our text window simulation of it. Refinement of our 
recognition and use of controlled indexing vocabulary is 
already showing benefits in more predictable domains, 
and we expect to see improvement in the results in the 
T IPSTER queries as well. 
The experiments in automatic oncept expansion based 
on cooccurrence behavior in large corpora are extremely 
interesting. Although the effects shown here are very 
preliminary, it is reassuring that they are positive even 
at this early stage. 
It is clear that incremental pplication of local (word and 
phrase-level) natural anguage processing is beneficial in 
information retrieval. At this stage, the only expected 
limits to this approach are represented by the improve- 
ment achieved with the experiments in interactive query 
modification.
