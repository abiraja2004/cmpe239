Abstract 
This paper proposes a method for assigning 
gestures to text based on lexical and syntactic 
information. First, our empirical study identi-
fied lexical and syntactic information strongly 
correlated with gesture occurrence and sug-
gested that syntactic structure is more useful 
for judging gesture occurrence than local syn-
tactic cues. Based on the empirical results, we 
have implemented a system that converts text 
into an animated agent that gestures and 
speaks synchronously. 
1 Introduction  
The significant advances in computer graphics over the 
last decade have improved the expressiveness of ani-
mated characters and have promoted research on inter-
face agents, which serve as mediators of human-
computer interactions. As an interface agent has an em-
bodied figure, it can use its face and body to display 
nonverbal behaviors while speaking.  
Previous studies in human communication suggest 
that gestures in particular contribute to better under-
standing of speech. About 90% of all gestures by 
speakers occur when the speaker is actually uttering 
something (McNeill, 1992). Experimental studies have 
shown that spoken sentences are heard twice as accu-
rately when they are presented along with a gesture 
(Berger & Popelka, 1971). Comprehension of a descrip-
tion accompanied by gestures is better than that accom-
panied by only the speaker?s face and lip movements 
(Rogers, 1978). These previous studies suggest that 
generating appropriate gestures synchronized with 
speech is a promising approach to improving the per-
formance of interface agents. In previous studies of 
multimodal generation, gestures were determined ac-
cording to the instruction content (Andre, Rist, & Mul-
ler, 1999; Rickel & Johnson, 1999), the task situation in 
a learning environment (Lester, Stone, & Stelling, 
1999), or the agent?s communicative goal in conversa-
tion (Cassell et al, 1994; Cassell, Stone, & Yan, 2000). 
These approaches, however, require the contents devel-
oper (e.g., a school teacher designing teaching materi-
als) to be skilled at describing semantic and pragmatic 
relations in logical form. A different approach, (Cassell, 
Vilhjalmsson, & Bickmore, 2001) proposes a toolkit 
that takes plain text as input and automatically suggests 
a sequence of agent behaviors synchronized with the 
synthesized speech. However, there has been little work 
in computational linguistics on how to identify and ex-
tract linguistic information in text in order to generate 
gestures.  
Our study has addressed these issues by considering 
two questions. (1) Is the lexical and syntactic informa-
tion in text useful for generating meaningful gestures? 
(2) If so, how can the information be extracted from the 
text and exploited in a gesture decision mechanism in 
an interface agent? Our goal is to develop a media con-
version technique that generates agent animations syn-
chronized with speech from plain text.  
This paper is organized as follows. The next section 
reviews theoretical issues about the relationships be-
tween gestures and syntactic information. The empirical 
study we conducted based on these issues is described 
in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 we describe the implementation of 
our presentation agent system, and in the last section we 
discuss future directions.  
2 Linguistic Theories and Gesture Studies 
In this section we review linguistic theories and discuss 
the relationship between gesture occurrence and syntac-
tic information.  
Linguistic quantity for reference: McNeill (McNeill, 
1992) used communicative dynamism (CD), which 
represents the extent to which the message at a given 
point is ?pushing the communication forward? (Firbas, 
1971), as a variable that correlates with gesture occur-
rence. The greater the CD, the more probable the occur-
rence of a gesture. As a measure of CD, McNeill chose 
the amount of linguistic material used to make the refer-
ence (Givon, 1985). Pronouns have less CD than full 
nominal phrases (NPs), which have less CD than modi-
fied full NPs. This implies that the CD can be estimated 
by looking at the syntactic structure of a sentence.  
Theme/Rheme: McNeill also asserted that the theme 
(Halliday, 1967) of a sentence usually has the least CD 
and is not normally accompanied by a gesture. Gestures 
usually accompany the rhemes, which are the elements 
of a sentence that plausibly contribute information 
about the theme, and thus have greater CD. In Japanese 
grammar there is a device for marking the theme explic-
itly. Topic marking postpositions (or ?topic markers?), 
typically ?wa,? mark a nominal phrase as the theme. 
This facilitates the use of syntactic analysis to identify 
the theme of a sentence. Another interesting aspect of 
information structure is that in English grammar, a wh-
interrogative (what, how, etc.) at the beginning of a 
sentence marks the theme and indicates that the content 
of the theme is the focus (Halliday, 1967). However, we 
do not know whether such a special type of theme is 
more likely to co-occur with a gesture or not.  
Given/New: Given and new information demonstrate 
an aspect of theme and rheme. Given information usu-
ally has a low degree of rhematicity, while new infor-
mation has a high degree. This implies that rhematicity 
can be estimated by determining whether the NP is the 
first mention (i.e., new information) or has already been 
mentioned (i.e., old or given information).  
Contrastive relationship: Prevost (1996) reported that 
intonational accent is often used to mark an explicit 
contrast among the salient discourse entities. On the 
basis of this finding and Kendon?s theory about the rela-
tionship between intonation phrases and gesture place-
ments (Kendon, 1972), Cassell & Prevost (1996) 
developed a method for generating contrastive gestures 
from a semantic representation. In syntactic analysis, a 
contrastive relation is usually expressed as a coordina-
tion, which is a syntactic structure including at least two 
conjuncts linked by a conjunction.  
Figure 1 shows an example of the correlation between 
gesture occurrence and the dependency structure of a 
Japanese sentence. Bunsetsu units (8)-(9) and (10)-(13) 
in the figure are conjuncts. A ?bunsetsu unit? in Japa-
nese corresponds to a phrase in English, such as a noun 
phrase or a prepositional phrase. Each conjunct is ac-
companied by a gesture. Bunsetsu (14) is a complement 
containing a verbal phrase; it depends on bunsetsu (15), 
which is an NP. Thus, bunsetsu (15) is a modified full 
NP and thus has large linguistic quantity.  
3 Empirical Study 
To identify linguistic features that might 
be useful for judging gesture occurrence, 
we videotaped seven presentation talks 
and transcribed three minutes for each of 
them. The collected data included 2124 
bunsetsu units and 343 gestures. 
Gesture Annotation: Three coders dis-
cussed how to code the half the data and reached a con-
sensus on gesture occurrence. After this consensus on 
the coding scheme was established1, one of the coders 
annotated the rest of the data. A gesture consists of 
preparation, stroke, and retraction (McNeill, 1992), and 
a stroke co-occurs with the most prominent syllable 
(Kendon, 1972). Thus, we annotated the stroke time as 
well as the start and end time of each gesture.  
Linguistic Analysis: Each bunsetsu unit was automati-
cally annotated with linguistic information using a Japa-
nese syntactic analyzer (Kurohashi & Nagao, 1994)2. 
The information was determined by asked the following 
questions for each bunsetsu unit. 
(a) If it is an NP, is it modified by a clause or a com-
plement? 
(b) If it is an NP, what type of postpositional particle 
marks its end (e.g., ?wa?, ?ga?, ?wo?)? 
(c) Is it a wh-interrogative? 
(d) Are all the content words in the bunsetsu unit have 
mentioned in a preceding sentence? 
(e) Is it a constituent of a coordination? 
Moreover, as we noticed that some lexical entities fre-
quently co-occurred with a gesture in our data, we used 
the syntactic analyzer to annotate additional lexical in-
formation based on the following questions.  
(f) Is the bunsetsu unit an emphatic adverbial phrase 
(e.g., very, extremely), or is it modified by a pre-
ceding emphatic adverb (e.g., very important is-
sue)? 
(g) Does it include a cue word (e.g., now, therefore)? 
(h) Does it include a numeral (e.g., thousands of people, 
99 times)? 
We then investigated the correlation between these 
lexical and syntactic features and the occurrence of ges-
ture strokes.  
Result: The results are summarized in Table 1. The 
baseline gesture occurrence frequency was 10.1% per 
bunsetsu unit (a gesture occurred once about every ten 
                                                          
1 Inter-coder reliability among the three coders in catego-
rizing the gestures (beat, iconic, etc.) was sufficiently high 
(Kappa = 0.81). Although we did not measure agreement on 
gesture occurrence itself, this result suggests that the coders 
had very similar schemes for recognizing gestures.  
2 To prevent the effects of parsing errors, errors in syntac-
tic dependency analysis were corrected manually for about 
13% of the data.

bunsetsu units). A gesture stroke most frequently co-
occurred with a bunsetsu unit forming a coordination 
(47.7%). When an NP was modified by a full clause, it 
was accompanied by a gesture 38.2% of the time. For 
the other types of noun phrases, including pronouns, 
when an accusative case marked with case marker ?wo? 
was new information (i.e., it was not mentioned in a 
previous sentence), a gesture co-occurred with the 
phrase 28.1% of the time. Moreover, gesture strokes 
frequently co-occurred with wh-interrogatives (41.4%), 
cue words (41.5%), and numeral words (39.3%). Ges-
ture strokes frequently occurred right after emphatic 
adverbs (35%) rather than with the adverb (24.4%).  
These cases listed in Table 1 had a 3 to 5 times higher 
probability of gesture occurrence than the baseline and 
accounted for 75% of all the gestures observed in the 
data. Our results suggest that these types of lexical and 
syntactic information can be used to distinguish be-
tween where a gesture should be assigned and where 
one should not be assigned. They also indicate that the 
syntactic structure of a sentence more strongly affects 
gesture occurrence than theme or rheme and than given 
or new information specified by local grammatical cues, 
such as topic markers and case markers.  
4 System Implementation 
4.1 Overview 
We used our results to build a presentation agent system, 
SPOC (Stream-oriented Public Opinion Channel).? This 
system enables a user to embody a story (written text) 
as a multimodal presentation featuring video, graphics, 
speech, and character animation. A snapshot of the 
SPOC viewer is shown in Figure 2.  
In order to implement a storyteller in SPOC, we de-
veloped an agent behavior generation system we call 
?CAST (Conversational Agent System for neTwork 
applications).? Taking text input, CAST automatically 
selects agent gestures and other nonverbal behaviors, 
calculates an animation schedule, and produces synthe-
sized voice output for the agent. As shown in Figure 2, 
CAST consists of four main components: (1) the Agent 
Behavior Selection Module (ABS), (2) the Language 
Tagging Module (LTM), (3) the agent animation system, 
and (4) a text-to-speech engine (TTS). The received text 
input is first sent to the ABS. The ABS selects appro-
priate gestures and facial expressions based on the lin-
guistic information calculated by the LTM. It then 
obtains the timing information from the TTS and calcu-
lates a time schedule for the set of agent actions. The 
output from the ABS is a set of animation instructions 
that can be interpreted and executed by the agent anima-
tion system. 
4.2 Determining Agent Behaviors 
Tagging linguistic information: First, the LTM parses 
the input text and calculates the linguistic information 
described in Sec. 3. For example, bunsetsu (9) in Figure 
1 has the following feature set. 
{Text-ID: 1, Sentence-ID: 1, Bunsetsu-ID: 9, Govern: 8, De-
pend-on: 13, Phrase-type: VP, Linguistic-quantity: NA, Case-
marker: NA, WH-interrogative: false, Given/New: new, Coor-
dinate-with: 13, Emphatic-Adv: false, Cue-Word: false, Nu-
meral: false} 
The text ID of this bunsetsu unit is 1, the sentence ID 
is 1, the bunsetsu ID is 9. This bunsetsu governs bun-
setsu 8 and depends on bunsetsu 13. It conveys new 
information and, together with bunsetsu 13, forms a 
parallel phrase.  
Assigning gestures: Then, for each bunsetsu unit, the 
ABS decides whether to assign a gesture or not based 
on the empirical results shown in Table 1. For example, 
bunsetsu unit (9) shown above matches case C4 in Ta-
ble 1, where a bunsetsu unit is a constituent of coordina-
tion. In this case, the system assigns a gesture to the 
bunsetsu with 47.7 % probability. In the current imple-
mentation, if a specific gesture for an emphasized con-
cept is defined in the gesture animation library (e.g., a 
gesture animation expressing ?big?), it is preferred to a 
?beat gesture? (a simple flick of the hand or fingers up 
and down (McNeill, 1992)). If a specific gesture is not 
defined, a beat gesture is used as the default.

The output of the ABS is stored in XML format. The 
type of action and the start and end times of the action 
are indicated by XML tags. In the example shown in 
Figure 3, the agent first gazes towards the user. It then 
performs contrast gestures at the second and sixth bun-
setsu units and a beat gesture at the eighth bunsetsu unit.  
Finally, the ABS transforms the XML into a time 
schedule by accessing the TTS engine and estimating 
the phoneme and bunsetsu boundary timings. The 
scheduling technique is similar to that described by 
(Cassell et al, 2001). The ABS also assigns visemes for 
the lip-sync and the facial expressions, such as head 
movement, eye gaze, blink, and eyebrow movement.  
5 Discussion and Conclusion 
We have addressed the issues related to assigning ges-
tures to text and converting the text into agent anima-
tions synchronized with speech. First, our empirical 
study identified useful lexical and syntactic information 
for assigning gestures to plain text. Specifically, when a 
bunsetsu unit is a constituent of coordination, gestures 
occur almost half the time. Gestures also frequently co-
occur with nominal phrases modified by a clause. These 
findings suggest that syntactic structure is a stronger 
determinant of gesture occurrence than theme or rheme 
and given or new information specified by local gram-
matical cues.  
We plan to enhance our model by incorporating more 
general discourse level information, though the current 
system exploits cue words as a very partial kind of dis-
course information. For instance, gestures frequently 
occur at episode boundaries. Pushing and popping of a 
discourse segment (Grosz & Sidner, 1986) may also 
affect gesture occurrence. Therefore, by integrating a 
discourse analyzer into the LTM, more general struc-
tural discourse information can be used in the model. 
Another important direction is to evaluate the effective-
ness of agent gestures in actual human-agent interaction. 
We expect that if our model can generate gestures with 
appropriate timing for emphasizing important words 
and phrases, users can perceive agent presentations as 
being more alive and comprehensible. We plan to con-
duct a user study to examine this hypothesis.
