Abstract
We demonstrate a robotic agent in a 3D
virtual environment that understands hu-
man navigational instructions. Such an
agent needs to select actions based on not
only instructions but also situations. It
is also expected to immediately react to
the instructions. Our agent incrementally
understands spoken instructions and im-
mediately controls a mobile robot based
on the incremental understanding results
and situation information such as the lo-
cations of obstacles and moving history. It
can be used as an experimental system for
collecting human-robot interactions in dy-
namically changing situations.
1 Introduction
Movable robots are ones that can execute tasks
by moving around. If such robots can understand
spoken language navigational instructions, they
will become more useful and will be widely used.
However, spoken language instructions are some-
times ambiguous in that their meanings differ de-
pending on the situations such as robot and obsta-
cle locations, so it is not always easy to make them
understand spoken language instructions. More-
over, when they receive instructions while they are
moving and they understand instructions only af-
ter they finish, accurate understanding is not easy
since the situation may change during the instruc-
tion utterances.
Although there have been several pieces of
work on robots that receive linguistic navigational
instructions (Marge and Rudnicky, 2010; Tellex et
al., 2011), they try to understand instructions be-
fore moving and they do not deal with instructions
when situations dynamically change.
We will demonstrate a 3D virtual robotic system
that understands spoken language navigational in-
structions in a situation-dependent way. It incre-
mentally understands instructions so that it can un-
derstand them based on the situation at that point
in time when the instructions are made.
2 A Mobile Robot in a 3D Virtual
Environment
We use a robotic system that works in a virtual
environment built on top of SIROS (Raux, 2010),
which was originally developed for collecting di-
alogues between two participants who are engag-
ing in an online video game. As an example, a
convenience store environment was developed and
a corpus of interaction was collected (Raux and
Nakano, 2010). One of the participants, the oper-
ator, controls a (simulated) humanoid robot whose
role is to answer all customer requests. The other
participant plays the role of a remote manager who
sees the whole store but can only interact with
the operator through speech. The operator has the
robot view (whose field of view and depth are lim-
ited to simulate a robot?s vision) and the manager
has a birds-eye view of the store (Figure 1). Cus-
tomers randomly visit the store and make requests
at various locations. The manager guides the op-
erator towards customers needing attention. The
operator then answers the customer?s requests and
gets points for each satisfied request.
Using the virtual environment described above,
we have developed a system that operates the robot
according to the human manager?s instructions.
Currently we deal with only navigational instruc-
tions for moving the robot to a customer.
Figure 2 depicts the architecture for our system.
We use Sphinx-4 (Lamere et al, 2003) for speech
recognition. Its acoustic model is trained on the
Wall Street Journal Corpus and its trigram lan-
guage model was trained on 1,616 sentences in the
human-human dialogue corpus described above.
Its vocabulary size is 275 words. We use Festival
(Black et al, 2001) for speech synthesis.

We use HRIME (HRI Intelligence Platform
based on Multiple Experts) (Nakano et al, 2008)
for dialogue and behavior control. In an HRIME
application, experts, which are modules dedicated
to specific tasks, are activated at appropriate times
and perform tasks. The navigation expert is ac-
tivated when the system receives a navigational
instruction. There are seven semantic categories
of instructions; they are turn-right, turn-left, go-
forward, go-back, repeat-the-previous-action, do-
the-opposite-action-of-the-previous-one, and stop.
Utterances that do not fall into any of these are ig-
nored. We assume that there are rules that match
linguistic patterns and those semantic categories.
For example, ?right? corresponds to turn-right,
and ?more? corresponds to repeat-the-previous-
action. The navigation expert sends the SIROS
server navigation commands based on the rec-
ognized semantic categories. Those commands
move the robot in the same way as a human op-
erator operates the robot using the keyboard, and
the results are shown on the display the manager
is watching. When the robot starts moving and it
cannot move because of an obstacle, it reports it to
the manager by sending its utterance to the speech
synthesizer.
When the robot has approached a customer who
is requesting help, the task is automatically per-
formed by the task execution expert.
The global context in the dialogue and behavior
controller stores information on the environment
which is obtained from the SIROS server, and it
can be used by the experts. As in the same way in
the human-human interaction, it holds information
only on customers and obstacles close to the robot
so that restricted robot vision can be simulated.
3 Situated Incremental Understanding
Sometimes manager utterances last without pauses
like ?right, right, more right, stop?, and the sit-
uation changes during the utterances because the
robot and the customers can move. So our sys-
tem employs incremental speech recognition and
moves the robot if a navigational instruction pat-
tern is found in the incremental output. To obtain
incremental speech recognition outputs, we em-
ployed InproTK (Baumann et al, 2010), which is
an extension to Sphinx-4. It enables the system
to receive tentative results every 10ms, which is a
hypothesis for the interval from the beginning of
speech to the point in time.
However, since incremental outputs are some-
times unstable and the instructions are ambiguous
in that the amount of movement is not specified,
not only incremental speech recognition outputs
but also obstacle locations and moving history is
used to determine the navigation commands.
In our system, the robot navigation expert re-
ceives incremental recognition results and if it
finds a navigational instruction pattern, it consults
the situation information in the global context,
and issues a navigation command based on sev-
eral situation-dependent understanding rules that
are manually written. Below are examples.
? If there is an obstacle in the direction that the
recognized instruction indicates, ignore the
recognized instruction. For example, when
?go forward? is recognized but there is an ob-
stacle ahead, it is guessed that the recognition
result was an error.

? When rotating, adjust the degree of rotation
so that the resulting orientation becomes par-
allel to obstacles such as a display shelf. This
enables the robot to smoothly go down the
aisles.
Figure 3 shows an example interaction. In the
demonstration, we will show how the robot moves
according to the spoken instructions by a human
looking at the manager display. We will compare
our system with its non-incremental version and a
version that does not use situation-dependent un-
derstanding rules to show how incremental situ-
ated understanding is effective.
4 Future Work
We are using this system for collecting a corpus
of human-robot interaction in dynamically chang-
ing situations so that we can analyze how hu-
mans make utterances in such situations. Fu-
ture work includes to make the system understand
more complicated utterances such as ?turn a lit-
tle bit to the left?. We are also planning to work
on automatically learning the situation-dependent
action selection rules from such a corpus (Vogel
and Jurafsky, 2010) to navigate the robot more
smoothly.
