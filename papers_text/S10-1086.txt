Abstract
We participated in the SemEval-2010
Japanese Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) task (Task 16) and focused on
the following: (1) investigating domain
differences, (2) incorporating topic fea-
tures, and (3) predicting new unknown
senses. We experimented with Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum
Entropy (MEM) classifiers. We achieved
80.1% accuracy in our experiments.
1 Introduction
We participated in the SemEval-2010 Japanese
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task (Task 16
(Okumura et al, 2010)), which has two new char-
acteristics: (1) Both training and test data across
3 or 4 domains. The training data include books
or magazines (called PB), newspaper articles (PN),
and white papers (OW). The test data also include
documents from a Q&A site on the WWW (OC);
(2) Test data include new senses (called X) that are
not defined in dictionary.
There is much previous research on WSD. In
the case of Japanese, unsupervised approaches
such as extended Lesk have performed well (Bald-
win et al, 2010), although they are outperformed
by supervised approaches (Tanaka et al, 2007;
Murata et al, 2003). Therefore, we selected a su-
pervised approach and constructed Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MEM)
classifiers using common features and topic fea-
tures. We performed extensive experiments to in-
vestigate the best combinations of domains for
training.
We describe the data in Section 2, and our sys-
tem in Section 3. Then in Section 4, we show the
results and provide some discussion.
2 Data Description
2.1 Given Data
We show an example of Iwanami Kokugo Jiten
(Nishio et al, 1994), which is a dictionary used as
a sense inventory. As shown in Figure 1, each en-
try has POS information and definition sentences
including example sentences.
We show an example of the given training data
in (1). The given data are morphologically ana-
lyzed and partly tagged with Iwanami?s sense IDs,
such as '37713-0-0-1-1( in (1).
(1) <mor pos='??-?}( rd='??( bfm='?
?( sense= '37713-0-0-1-1( >1<</mor>
This task includes 50 target words that were
split into 219 senses in Iwanami; among them, 143
senses including two Xs that were not defined in
Iwanami, appear in the training data. In the test
data, 150 senses including eight Xs appear. The
training and test data share 135 senses including
two Xs; that is, 15 senses including six Xs in the
test data are unseen in the training data.
2.2 Data Pre-processing
We performed two preliminary pre-processing
steps. First, we restored the base forms because
the given training and test data have no informa-
tion about the base forms. (1) shows an example
of the original morphological data, and then we
added the base form (lemma), as shown in (2).
(2) <mor pos=' ? ?-? } ( rd=' ? ? (
bfm=' ? ? ( sense='37713-0-0-1-1(
lemma='1d(>1<</mor>
Secondly, we extracted example sentences from
Iwanami, which is used as a sense inventory. To
compensate for the lack of training data, we an-
alyzed examples with a morphological analyzer,
Mecab1 UniDic version, because the training and
test data were tagged with POS based on UniDic.

3 System Description
3.1 Features
In this section, we describe the features we gener-
ated.
3.1.1 Baseline Features
For each target word w, we used the surface form,
the base form, the POS tag, and the top POS cat-
egories, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives of
w. Here the target is the ith word, so we also
used the same information of i? 2, i? 1, i+ 1, and
i+2th words. We used bigrams, trigrams, and skip-
bigrams back and forth within three words. We re-
fer to the model that uses these baseline features
as bl.
3.1.2 Bag-of-Words
For each target word w, we got all base forms of
the content words within the same document or
within the same article for newspapers (PN). We
refer to the model that uses these baseline features
as bow.
3.1.3 Topic Features
In the SemEval-2007 English WSD tasks, a sys-
tem incorporating topic features achieved the
highest accuracy (Cai et al, 2007). Inspired by
(Cai et al, 2007), we also used topic features.
Their approach uses Bayesian topic models (La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation: LDA) to infer topics in
an unsupervised fashion. Then the inferred topics
2We use ACC as an abbreviation of accusative
postposition.
are added as features to reduce the sparsity prob-
lem with word-only features.
In our proposed approach, we use the inferred
topics to find 'related?( words and directly add
these word counts to the bag-of-words representa-
tion.
We applied gibbslda++3 to the training and test
data to obtain multiple topic classification per doc-
ument or article for newspapers (PN). We used the
document or article topics for newspapers (PN) in-
cluding the target word. We refer to the model
that uses these topic features as tpX, where X is
the number of topics and tpdistX with the topics
weighted by distributions. In particular, the topic
distribution of each document/article is inferred by
the LDA topic model using standard Gibbs sam-
pling.
We also add the most typical words in the topic
as a bag-of-words. For example, one topic might
include ? city, ?? Tokyo, ? train line, ? ward
and so on. A second topic might include ?? dis-
section, ? after, ?? medicine, U grave and so
on. If a document is inferred to contain the first
topic, then the words (? city, ?? Tokyo, ? train
line, ...) are added to the bag-of-words feature. We
refer to these features as twdY, including the most
typical Y words as bag-of-words.
3.2 Investigation between Domains
In preliminary experiments, we used both SVM4
and MEM (Nigam et al, 1999), with optimization
method L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to train
the WSD model.
First, we investigated the effect between do-
mains (PN, PB, and OW). For training data, we se-
lected words that occur in more than 50 sentences,
separated the training data by domain, and tested
different domain combinations.
Table 1 shows the SVM results of the domain
combinations. For Table 1, we did a 5-fold cross
validation for the self domain and for comparison

OW +PB 88.34 0.43

with the results after adding the other domain data.
In Table 1, Diff. shows the differences to the self
domain.
As shown in Table 1, for PN and OW, using other
domains improved the results, but for PB, other do-
mains degraded the results. So we decided to se-
lect the domains for each target word.
In the formal run, for each pair of domain and
target words, we selected the combination of do-
main and dictionary examples that got the best
cross-validation result in the training data. Note
that in the case of no training data for the test data
domain, for example, since no OCs have training
data, we used all training data and dictionary ex-
amples.
We show the number of selected domain combi-
nations for each target domain in Table 2. Because
the distribution of target words is very unbalanced
in domains, not all types of target words appear in
every domain, as shown in Table 2.
3.3 Method for Predicting New Senses
We also tried to predict new senses (X) that didn?t
appear in the training data by calculating the en-
tropy for each target given in the MEM. We as-
sumed that high entropy (when the probabilities
of classes are uniformly dispersed) was indicative
of X; i.e., if [entropy > threshold] => predict X;
else => predict with MEM?s output sense tag.
Note that we used the words that were tagged
with Xs in the training data, except for the target
words. We compared the entropies of X and not
X of the words and heuristically tuned the thresh-
old based on the differences among entropies. Our
three official submissions correspond to different
thresholds.

4 Results and Discussions
Our cross-validation experiments on the training
set showed that selecting data by domain combi-
nations works well, but unfortunately this failed
to achieve optimal results on the formal run. In
this section, we show the results using all of the
training data with no domain selections (also after
fixing some bugs).
Table 3 shows the results for the combination
of features on the test data. MEM greatly outper-
formed SVM. Its effective features are also quite
different. In the case of MEM, baseline features
(bl) almost gave the best result, and the topic fea-
tures improved the accuracy, especially when di-
vided into 200 topics. But for SVM, the topic
features are not so effective, and the bag-of-words
features improved accuracy.
For MEM with bl +tp200, which produced the
best result, the following are the best words: ?
outside (accuracy is 100%), C^ economy (98%),
?!d think (98%), d& big (98%), and %Z
culture (98%). On the other hand, the following
are the worst words: 1d take (36%), ? good
(48%), ?+d raise (48%), w2 put out (50%),
and ?= stand up (54%).
In Table 4, we show the results for each POS (bl
+tp200, MEM). The results for the verbs are com-
parably lower than the others. In future work, we
will consider adding syntactic features that may
improve the results.

In the formal run, we selected training data
for each pair of domain and target words and
used entropy to predict new unknown senses. Al-
though these two methods worked well in our
cross-validation experiments, they did not perform
well for the test data, probably due to domain mis-
match.
Finally, we also experimented with SVM and
MEM, and MEM gave better results.
