Abstract 
Accurate evaluation of machine 
translation (MT) is an open problem. A 
brief survey of the current approach to 
tackle this problem is presented and a 
new proposal is introduced. This proposal 
attempts to measure the percentage of 
words, which should be modified at the 
output of an automatic translator in order 
to obtain a correct translation. To show 
the feasibility of the method we have 
assessed the most important Spanish-
Catalan translators in comparing the 
results obtained by the various methods.  
1 Introduction 
Research in automatic translation lacks an 
appropriate, consistent and easy to use criterion 
for evaluating the results (White et al, 1994; 
Niessen et al, 2000). However, it turns out to be 
indispensable to have some tool that may allow 
us to compare two translation systems or to elicit 
how any variation of our system may affect the 
quality of the translations. This is important in 
the field of research as well as when a user has to 
choose between two or more translators.  
The evaluation of a translation system shows 
a number of inherent difficulties. First of all we 
are dealing with a subjective process, which is 
even difficult to define.  
This paper is circumscribed to the project 
SISHITRA (SIStemas H?bridos para la 
TRAducci?n valenciano-castellano supported by 
the Spanish Government), whose aim is the 
construction of an automatic translator between 
Spanish and Catalan texts using hybrid methods 
(both deductive and inductive).  
In the following section we discuss some of 
the most important translation quality metrics. 
After that, we introduce a semiautomatic 
methodology for MT evaluation and we show a 
tool to facilitate this kind of evaluation. Finally, 
we present the results obtained on the evaluation 
of several Spanish-Catalan translators. 
 
2 Metrics in MT Evaluation 
2.1    Automatic Evaluation Criteria 
Within the scope of inductive translation, the use 
of objective metrics, which can be evaluated 
automatically, is quite frequent. These metrics 
take as their starting point a possible reference 
translation for each of the sentences we want to 
translate. This reference will be compared with 
the proposed sentences by the translation system. 
The most important metric systems are: 
 
Word Error Rate (WER): 
WER is the percentage of words, which are to be 
inserted, deleted or replaced in the translation in 
order to obtain the sentence of reference (Vidal, 
1997; Tillmann et al, 1997). WER can be 
obtained automatically by using the editing 
distance between both sentences. This metric is 
computed efficiently and is reproducible 
(successive applications to the same data produce 
the same results). However, the main drawback is 
its dependency on the sentences of reference. 
There is an almost unlimited number of correct 
translations for one and the same sentence and, 
however, this metric considers only one to be 
correct.  
Sentence Error Rate (SER): 
SER indicates the percentage of sentences, whose 
translations have not matched in an exact manner 
those of reference. It shows similar advantages 
and shortcomings as WER.  
Some variations on WER have been defined, 
which can also be obtained automatically: 
 
Multi reference WER (mWER): 
Identical approach to WER, but it considers 
several references for each sentence to be 
translated, i.e., for each sentence the editing 
distance will be calculated with regard to the 
various references and the smallest one is chosen 
(Niessen et al, 2000). It presents the drawback of 
requiring a great human effort before actually 
being able to use it. However, the effort is 
worthwhile, if it can be later used for hundreds of 
evaluations.  
 
BLEU Score: 
BLEU is an automatic metric designed by IBM, 
which uses several references (Papineni et al, 
2002). The main problem of mWER is that all 
possible reference translations cannot be 
introduced. The BLEU score try to solve this 
problem by combining the available references. 
In a simplified manner we could say that it 
measures how many word sequences in the 
sentence under evaluation match the word 
sequences of some reference sentence. The 
BLEU score also includes a penalty for 
translations whose length differs significantly 
from that of the reference translation. 
2.2     Subjective Evaluation Criteria 
Other kinds of metrics have been developed, 
which require human intervention in order to 
obtain an evaluation. Among the most widely 
used we could stand out:  
 
Subjective Sentence Error Rate (SSER) 
Each sentence is scored from 0 to 10, according 
to its translation quality (Niessen et al, 2000).  
An example of these categories is: 
 
0 ? nonsensical...  
1 ? some aspects of the content are conveyed 
... 
5 ? comprehensible, but with important 
syntactic errors 
... 
9 ? OK. Only slight style errors. 
10 ? perfect. 
  
The biggest problem shown by this technique is 
its subjective nature. Two people who may 
evaluate the same experiment could obtain quite 
different results. To solve this problem several 
evaluations can be performed. Another drawback 
is that the different sentence lengths have not 
been taken into account. The score of a 100 
word-long sentence has the same impact on the 
total score as that of a word-long sentence.  
 
Information Item Error Rate (IER) 
An unclear question is how to evaluate long 
sentences consisting of correct and wrong parts. 
IER attempts to find a solution to this question. 
In order to solve the problem the concept of 
?information items? is introduced. The sentences 
are divided into word segments. Each item of the 
sentence is marked with ?OK?, ?error?, ?syntax?, 
?meaning? or ?others?, as shown in the 
translation. The metric IER (Information Item 
Error Rate) can then be calculated as the 
percentage of badly translated items (not marked 
as ?OK?) (Niessen et al, 2000).  
 
2.3 New Evaluation Criteria 
 
Automatic metrics are especially useful, since 
their cost is practically null. However, they are 
very dependent on the used references. In some 
cases they can yield misleading results, for 
instance, if we want to compare an inductive 
translation system with some deductive one 
which, in principle, should produce translations 
of a similar quality. If we extract the references 
from the same source as the training material of 
the inductive translator, the inductive translator 
will have an advantage over the deductive 
translator, since it has learned to translate by 
using a vocabulary and structures that are similar 
to those appearing in the references.  
The non-automatic evaluation metrics 
described above presents various constraints: 
When an SSER is used, it may be very difficult 
to decide the score to be assigned to one 
sentence. For example, if in one sentence a small 
syntactic error appears, we can assign an 8. If in 
the following sentence two similar errors appear, 
what score should we assign? The same or half 
the score? To solve these kinds of matters, IER 
introduces the concept of ?information item?. 
This proposal has the drawback of being quite 
costly, both during the initial stage of deciding 
the word segments which form each item as well 
as when classifying the correction for each item. 
After having seen the previous drawbacks the 
following metric has been introduced: 
 
All references WER (aWER): 
It measures the number of words, which are to be 
inserted, deleted or replaced in the sentence 
under evaluation in order to obtain a correct 
translation. It can also be seen as a particular case 
of the mWER, but taking for granted that all the 
possible references are at our disposal. Since it is 
impossible to have a priori all possible 
references, the evaluator will be able to propose 
new references, if needed. The evaluation process 
can be carried out very quickly, if one takes as 
the starting point the result obtained by the WER 
or the mWER. The idea consists of visualising 
the incorrect words detected by one of these 
methods (editing operations). The evaluator just 
needs to indicate whether each of the marked 
items is an actual error or whether it can rather be 
considered as an alternative translation 
This metric resembles very much the one 
proposed in (Brown et al 1990). That work 
suggested for measuring the translation quality 
counting the number of times an evaluator would 
have to press the keyboard keys in order to make 
the proposed sentence correct.  
 
All references Sentence Error Rate (aSER): 
The SER metric presents the drawback of 
working with only one reference. Therefore, it 
does not really measure the number of wrong 
sentences, but rather those that do not match 
exactly the reference. For this reason we thought 
it would be interesting to introduce a metric that 
could indicate the percentage of sentences whose 
acronym name  on references description

% of words which are to be inserted, 
deleted or replaced in order to obtain the 
reference.

Table 1. Some metrics in MT evaluation 
translations are incorrect. This metric can be 
obtained as a by-product of the aWER. 
3 Evaluation Tool for MT  
In order to facilitate the evaluation of automatic 
translators a graphic user interface has been 
implemented. The metrics provided by the 
program are: WER, mWER, aWER, SER, SSER 
and aSER. Figure 1 shows how it is displayed. 
Next, the way the program works is described:  
On the editing window from top to bottom the 
following items are displayed: the source 
sentence, the sentence to be evaluated, the new 
sentences proposed by the user, the four most 
similar references to the sentence under 
evaluation (according to editing distance). The 
new sentence proposed by the user will be in 
principle the same as that of the most similar 
reference.  In the sentence being evaluated using 
different colours, depending on whether they are 
considered insertions, replacements or deletions, 
the words that may be wrong are highlighted.  
The user can click with the mouse on those 
words that may be considered correct. As a 
result, this action will modify the new reference.  
In the example (figure 1), if the user clicks on the 
highlighted words ?-?, ?Diagram? and ?locate?, 
he will obtain the new reference ?Diagram 
shows the scan procedure to locate the 
archives.?. This new reference reduces the 
editing distance from 5 to 2. The user will also be 
able to click directly on some word of new 
reference to modify it. The aim of this is to allow 
the evaluator the introduction of any new 
reference which may be a correct translation of 
the source sentence and which, furthermore, may 
resemble most closely the sentence being 
evaluated. 
This tool can be obtained for free on 
(http://ttt.gan.upv.es/~jtomas/eval), both in the 
Linux version as wells as in Windows. 
3.1 Evaluation Database Format 
A format in XML has been defined to store the 
reference files. For each evaluation sentence we 
store: the source sentence, the target reference 
sentences and the target sentences proposed by 
the different MT with their subjective

between the evaluation sentence and the nearest reference.  
evaluations. Should during an aWER evaluation 
a new reference be proposed, this one is also 
stored. An example of a file with a sentence 
under evaluation is shown as follows:  
 
<evalTrans>

4 Example of Evaluation 
4.1 Spanish-Catalan Translators 
The tool described in the previous section has 
been applied to the most important Spanish-
Catalan translators.  
The Catalan language receives more or less 
intense institutional support in all territories of 
the Spanish state, where it is co-official with  
Spanish (Balearic Islands, Catalonia and 
Valencian Community). This makes it 
compulsory from an administrative standpoint to 
publish a bilingual edition of all official 
documents. For that purpose the use of a 
Machine Translator becomes almost 
indispensable.  
But the official scope is not the only one 
where we can find the need to write bilingual 
documents in a short period of time. The most 
obvious example can be the bilingual edition of 
some newspapers, such as El Pa?s or El 
Peri?dico de Catalunya, both in their editions for 
the autonomous community of Catalonia.  
In the following section there is a brief 
description of each of the programs we have 
reviewed: 
Salt: an automatic translation program of the 
Valencian local government, which also includes 
a text corrector. It can be downloaded for free 
from http://www.cultgva.es.  It has an interactive 
option for solving doubts (subjective ambiguity 
resolution) and is executed with the OS 
Microsoft Windows.  
Incyta: the translation business web-site 
Incyta (http://www.incyta.com) was adding at the 
time of this evaluation example review a free on-
line automatic translator for short texts.  
Internostrum: an on-line automatic 
translation program, available at 
http://www.torsimany.ua.es, designed by the 
Language and Computational Systems 
Department of the University of Alicante. It 
marks the doubtful words or segments as a 
review helping aid. It uses finite-state technology 
(Canals et al, 2001).  
Statistical: An experimental translator 
developed at the Computer Technology Institute 
of the Polytechnic University of Valencia. All 
components have been inferred automatically 
from training pairs using statistical methods 
(Tom?s & Casacuberta, 2001). It is accessible at 
http://ttt.gan.upv.es/~jtomas/trad. 
4.2 Setting up the evaluation experiment 
In order to carry out our evaluation, we have 
translated 120 sentences (2456 words) with the 
different MT. These sentences have been taken 
from different media: a newspaper, a technical 
manual, legal text...  The references used by the 
WER were also taken from the Catalan version of 
the same documents. In mWER and in BLEU we 
used three additional references. These new 
references have been introduced by a human 
translator modifying the initial reference. 
Before applying the metrics shown in point 2, 
a human expert carries out a detailed analysis in 
order to establish the quality of the translations. 
The experiment consists of sorting out the four 
outputs obtained by each translator for each test 
sentence, according to its quality. If the expert 
does no find any quality difference between the 
sentences proposed by two translators, he assigns 
the same rank to them. Table 2 shows the results 
obtained. After this sentence by sentence 
analysis, the expert concludes that Salt is the 
better translator, followed closely by Incyta. 
Statistical is in an intermediate position and the 
worst is Internostrum.  
4.3 Results  
The results of our experiment can be observed in 
Figure 2. Table 3 shows the evaluation time for 
the 120 sentences. The first thing we can point 
out is that the Salt translator obtains the best 
results from all used metrics and Internostrum is 
the worst of all metrics. The other two translators 
obtain different results depending on the used 
method. Next we will discuss the results obtained 
by the different methods:  
The WER metric shows a strong dependence 
on the used reference. If the translator employs a 
similar style or vocabulary with regard to those 
of the reference, it clearly achieves better results. 
This fact determines that the obtained results do 
not show faithfully the quality of the translations. 
Specifically, for Incyta it obtains bad results, 
although that does not coincide with the 
conclusions of the expert. 
The main advantage of this method is that it is 
a totally automatic measurement without any 
evaluation cost. These conclusions can also be 
extended to the SER.  
mWER solves in part the problem posed by 
the WER. To attempt to introduce a priori all 
possible translations turns out to be impossible, 
so that it has to choose a subset of these giving 
thus the method a certain subjective nature. In the 
case of our evaluation, the references were 
introduced by using certain dialectal variants. 
That worked slightly against some automatic 
translator, which preferred some other dialectal 
variants. 
 The BLEU metric tries to combine the 
available references in order to improve the 
mWER metric. In our experiment the use of 
several references, in mWER and BLEU, does 
not solve the deficiency of WER. It continues 
being most detrimental to Incyta. 
The use of the mWER and BLEU required a 
great initial effort, when the references were 
written, by even choosing only three new 
references for each translation. However, these 
methods had a big advantage: each evaluation is 
done without any additional cost.   
When we applied the SSER, we faced the 
following dilemma: Which criteria should we use 
for applying the scoring scale? We decided that 
the latter had to be related with the global 
understanding of the sentence and the number of 
errors in correspondence with the sentence 
length. Since this criterion is not made explicit in 
the method the choice of a different criterion 
would have produced very diverse results.  
Regarding the evaluation effort, it was the 
most costly method. In order to evaluate each 
sentence it was necessary to read and understand 
both the source sentence and the target sentence 
to try to score at the end the translation.  
The aWER metric breaks with the 
dependence on the used references, which 
displayed the WER, mWER and BLEU. 
Moreover, it turned out to be much more 
objective and clearer to apply than the SSER. 
The metric achieved by this method provides us 
with clear and intuitive information. If we use the 
Salt translator we will have to correct 3% of the 
words in order to obtain a correct translation. 
Interpret the metrics supplied by the other 
methods it becomes unavoidable to know the 
conditions under which the evaluation has been 
carried out (references used, criteria ...).  
The evaluation effort for the aWER is 
significantly less than the mWER and the SSER.

Statistical 60% 13% 7% 20% 
Internostrum 48% 12% 20% 20% 
 
Table 2. Comparative classification sentence by sentence. 
 
The discussion on the aWER method can be 
extended to the aSER.  
Considering the expert evaluation, the 
subjective metrics reflect better the quality of the 
evaluated translations than the automatic ones. 
The Incyta translator works quite appropriately, 
but it proposes translations that deviate from the 
references. Thus, the automatic measures (WER, 
mWER and BLEU), based on these references, 
do not evaluate correctly this translator. On the 
other hand, the Statistical Translator works 
worse, even though its translations are more 
similar to the references. It is an example-based 
translator, and the training and test sentences 
have been obtained from the same sources. This 
can benefit the evaluation of the Statistical 
translator using automatic measures.   
5 Conclusions  
In this paper we present a criterion (aWER) for 
the evaluation of translation systems. The 
evaluation of the translations can be carried out 
quickly thanks to the use of a computer tool 
developed for this purpose. 
We have compared this criterion with other 
criteria (WER, mWER, SER, BLEU and SSER) 
using the translations obtained by several 
Spanish-Catalan translators. It is our 
understanding that automatic measures (WER, 
mWER and BLEU) do not evaluate correctly the 
translators (specifically, they affect Incyta 
negatively).

The scores produced by human experts (SSER 
and aWER) are the metrics that best capture the 
translation quality among the different systems. 
As its most important aWER feature we would 
stand out that, in spite of being a subjective 
method which requires the intervention of a 
human evaluator, the latter will not have to take 
too subjective decisions. 
We believe that the aWER tool could be used 
in another domain, for the evaluation of other 
natural language processing systems, e.g.  
summarizing systems. 
In a future our aim is to add to this 
comparative study other score methods, in 
addition to comparing the variability introduced 
by different human evaluators in each of the 
methods.
