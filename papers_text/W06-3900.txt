About ICoS
Natural Language Processing has reached a stage where the exploration and development of
inference is one of its most pressing tasks. On the theoretical side, it is clear that inference
plays a key role in such areas as semantic construction and the management of discourse
and dialogue. On the practical side, the use of sophisticated inference methods is expected
to play a crucial role in such application areas as natural language generation, automatic
question answering, and spoken dialogue systems. At the same time, inference tools and
resources have matured to the point that they can become useful for actual applications.
Automated theorem provers and other inference tools are becoming increasingly robust and
efficient. And the world knowledge bottleneck is being addressed from different angles, by
the manual development of knowledge resources, the merging of existing such resources,
and the automated extraction of world knowledge from corpora.
The Inference in Computational Semantics (ICoS) workshops are intended to bring
together researchers from areas such as Computational Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence,
Computer Science, Formal Semantics, and Logic, to discuss approaches to, and applica-
tions of, inference in natural language semantics. ICoS-1 took place in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, on August 15, 1999. ICoS-2 was organised in Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, on
July 29?30, 2000. ICoS-3 was co-located with the International Joint Conference on Au-
tomated Reasoning (IJCAR 2001), which took place on June 18?23, 2001 at Siena, Italy.
ICoS-4 took place in Nancy, France, on September 25?26, 2003.
Welcome to ICoS-5
ICoS-5 is organised as a two-day event at the University of Derby College, Buxton, Eng-
land, taking place on April 20?21. The programme features three invited presentations
(by Christian Ebert, Patrick Pantel, and Stephen Pulman). In addition, we have selected
twelve regular papers from 24 submissions, which span topics ranging from the use of infer-
ence techniques for formal and computational semantics, over new methods for knowledge
extraction from corpora, to NLP applications that use inference tools.
We have accepted six of the remaining submissions as ?short papers?. These papers
will be presented as posters and demos at the workshop, and we believe that this new
format will be a worthwhile experience both for authors and for participants.
We would like to thank the members of the programme committee, who produced highly
informative reviews and made it possible to set up the broad and strong program for ICoS-
5. Finally, we are very grateful to the local organisers, Ian Pratt-Hartmann and Allan
Ramsay, who did a flawless job of preparing what promises to be a wonderful workshop
location for us.

Expressive Power and Complexity
of Underspecified Representations
Christian Ebert
Fakulta?t fu?r Linguistik und Literaturwissenschaft
Universita?t Bielefeld
My talk will be about two requirements on Underspecified Representation Formalisms in
the context of underspecification of scope. The requirement on partial disambiguation,
stating that partially disambiguated ambiguities need to be represented, does not carry
much content unless it has become clear, exactly what those ambiguities are. In line with
Ko?nig and Reyle [1999], I will argue that all theoretically possible patterns of ambiguity,
i.e. subsets of readings, can occur in natural language, in particular when underspeci-
fied representations are assumed to represent patterns of ambiguity that arise through
disambiguation by discourse or even by world knowledge. Therefore an underspecified
representation formalism can only be regarded as expressively complete, if it provides rep-
resentations for all potential subsets of readings. Taking a closer look at recent prominent
approaches to scope underspecification, namely Hole Semantics [Bos, 2002], Minimal Re-
cursion Semantics [Copestake et al, 1999], and Normal Dominance Constraints [Koller,
2004], it turns out that none of these formalisms is expressively complete. Furthermore,
these incompleteness results allow for a straightforward comparison of the discussed ap-
proaches with respect to expressive power.
The second requirement is the avoidance of combinatorial explosion. I will argue that
the decisive process that determines the efficiency of an underspecification approach is
the construction phase of the representations and not so much the check for satisfiability
or enumeration of readings. Thus the desired avoidance of combinatorial explosion comes
down to a requirement on a feasible construction procedure and hence to a requirement on
the maximal ?size? of the representations, which can only be fulfilled if the involved repre-
sentations are in some sense more compact than the mere listing of the available readings.
Unfortunately it turns out that due to the rapid growth of the number of potential patterns
of ambiguity, the two requirements of compactness and expressive completeness cannot be
fulfilled at the same time. In other words, I will show that any underspecified representa-
tion formalism must necessarily miss out on some of the potential patterns of ambiguity
or run into the combinatorial explosion problem [Ebert, 2005].

Knowledge Harvesting and Fusion from Small and Large CorporaPatrick PantelISI, University of Southern CaliforniaInferencing requires large collections of axioms and knowledge bases of interrelatedconcepts and instances. In the past decade, researchers have explored many approaches toautomatically learn such knowledge from textual corpora. In this two-part talk, we willdiscuss the challenges of harvesting knowledge from various corpus sizes and we willlook at some recent attempts at fusing the knowledge into a single semantic repository.On the harvesting front, we will focus on the challenges posed by three types of corpora:i) the Web (order of 1012 words) ? pattern learning algorithms, models of reliability, andscalable computing; ii) large corpora such as newswire collections (order of 109 words) ?amenable to complex natural language processing and clustering; and iii) small corporasuch as college textbooks (order of 105 words) ? in which low redundancy requiresleveraging external resources such as the Web and ontologies.This multitude of harvested knowledge inevitably overlaps and is partially inconsistentand incompatible since information can be expressed across data sources in so manyways. However, little effort has been spent on fusing such harvested knowledge into anoverarching consistent semantic repository. We will present a recent algorithm for linkingsemantic resources using grammatical templates. We will also present an algorithm toautomatically induce conceptual relations between mid-level ontological concepts andthen disambiguate instances with regard to the most appropriate senses in the ontology,using the induced conceptual relations.

Bridging the gap between formal and computational semantics
Stephen Pulman
Computational Linguistics Group, Oxford University.
The literature in formal linguistic semantics contains a wealth of fine grained
and detailed analyses of many linguistic phenomena. But very little of this work
has found its way into implementations, despite a widespread feeling (among
linguists at least) that this can?t be very difficult in principle: you just fix a
grammar to produce the right logical forms and hook them up to a theorem
prover, don?t you? In this talk I take a representative analysis of adjectival
comparatives and ask what steps one might actually have to go through so as to
use this analysis in a realistic question-answering setting. I then try to identify
some general conclusions that can be drawn from this exercise.
