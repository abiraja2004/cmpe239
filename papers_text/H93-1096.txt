PROJECT GOALS 
1. To coordinate the design, development and distribution 
of speech and natural language corpora for the DARPA 
Spoken Language research community. 
2. To design, coordinate implementation, a d analyze the 
results of performance assessment benchmark tests for 
DARPA's speech recognition and spoken language under- 
standing systems. 
RECENT RESULTS 
1. Acquired hardware and installed the MIT/LCS-devel- 
oped "TINA" and SRI-developed "DECIPHER"(tm) ATIS 
systems. 
2. Revised the NIST speech recognition software to incor- 
porate phonologically-motivated s ring alignment proce- 
dures, and prepared an ICASSP'93 paper to document the 
advantages ofthis approach. 
3. Developed a speech data quality assurance software 
package to measure S/N and other properties. Shared this 
software package with other sites, including SRI, for use in 
monitoring quality for the WSJ-CSR corpora. 
4. Acquired and made use of recordable CD-ROM technol- 
ogy for preliminary, limited, distribution of speech corpora. 
5. Participated, with SRI, in annotation and "bug fixes" for 
the ATIS MADCOW-coUected corpora. 
6. Prepared for, and implemented benchmark tests for: (1) 
the Resource Management corpus (final test set, Septem- 
ber), (2) the WSJ-CSR corpus (November), (3) the "dry nan 
stress test" (December), (4) the ATIS MADCOW corpus 
(November), and (5) the "dry run end-to-end" evaluation 
(JanualT). 
PLANS 
1. Produce and distribute the next phase of the WSJ-CSR 
corpora, "WSJ-CSR Phase II, Part 1", and some portion of 
Part 2, on pressed CD-ROM in collaboration with the Lin- 
guistic Data Consortium. 
2. Coordinate collection, screening and processing of the 
next portion of ATIS MADCOW data, to be collected with 
the 46-city OAG- derived relational database. 
3. Implement benchmark tests in the WSJ-CSR and ATIS 
domains, as required by the DARPA Program Manager and 
Coordinating Committee.
