Abstract
This paper describes our experiments of us-
ing Amazon?s Mechanical Turk to generate
(counter-)facts from texts for certain named-
entities. We give the human annotators a para-
graph of text and a highlighted named-entity.
They will write down several (counter-)facts
about this named-entity in that context. The
analysis of the results is performed by com-
paring the acquired data with the recognizing
textual entailment (RTE) challenge dataset.
1 Motivation
The task of RTE (Dagan et al, 2005) is to say
whether a person would reasonably infer some short
passage of text, the Hypothesis (H), given a longer
passage, the Text (T). However, collections of such
T-H pairs are rare to find and these resources are the
key to solving the problem.
The datasets used in the RTE task were collected
by extracting paragraphs of news text and manu-
ally constructing hypotheses. For the data collected
from information extraction task, the H is usually
a statement about a relation between two named-
entities (NEs), which is written by expertise. Simi-
larly, the H in question answering data is constructed
using both the question and the (in)correct answers.
Therefore, the research questions we could ask are,
1. Are these hypotheses really those ones people
interested in?
2. Are hypotheses different if we construct them
in other ways?
3. What would be a good negative hypotheses
compared with the positive ones?
In this paper, we address these issues by using
Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), online non-
expert annotators (Snow et al, 2008). Instead of
constructing the hypotheses targeted to IE or QA, we
just ask the human annotators to come up with some
facts they consider as relevant to the given text. For
negative hypotheses, we change the instruction and
ask them to write counter-factual but still relevant
statements. In order to narrow down the content of
the generated hypotheses, we give a focused named-
entity (NE) for each text to guide the annotators.
2 Related Work
The early related research was done by Cooper et al
(1996), where they manually construct a textbook-
style corpus aiming at different semantic phenom-
ena involved in inference. However, the dataset is
not large enough to train a robust machine-learning-
based RTE system. The recent research from the
RTE community focused on acquiring large quan-
tities of textual entailment pairs from news head-
lines (Burger and Ferro, 2005) and negative exam-
ples from sequential sentences with transitional dis-
course connectives (Hickl et al, 2006). Although
the quality of the data collected were quite good,
most of the positive examples are similar to summa-
rization and the negative examples are more like a
comparison/contrast between two sentences instead
of a contradiction. Those data are the real sen-
tences used in news articles, but the way of obtain-
ing them is not necessarily the (only) best way to
163
find entailment pairs. In this paper, we investigate
an alternative inexpensive way of collecting entail-
ment/contradiction text pairs by crowdsourcing.
In addition to the information given by the text,
common knowledge is also allowed to be involved
in the inference procedure. The Boeing-Princeton-
ISI (BPI) textual entailment test suite1 is specifically
designed to look at entailment problems requiring
world knowledge. We will also allow this in the de-
sign of our task.
3 Design of the Task
The basic idea of the task is to give the human an-
notators a paragraph of text with one highlighted
named-entity and ask them to write some (counter-
)facts about it. In particular, we first preprocess
an existing RTE corpus using a named-entity rec-
ognizer to mark all the named-entities appearing in
both T and H. When we show the texts to Turkers,
we highlight one named-entity and give them one of
these two sets of instructions:
Facts: Please write several facts about the high-
lighted words according to the paragraph. You
may add additional common knowledge (e.g.
Paris is in France), but please mainly use the
information contained in the text. But please
do not copy and paste!
Counter-Facts: Please write several statements that
are contradictory to the text. Make your state-
ments about the highlighted words. Please use
the information mainly in the text. Avoid using
words like not or never.
Then there are three blank lines given for the annota-
tors to fill in facts or counter-factual statements. For
each HIT, we gather facts or counter-facts for five
texts, and for each text, we ask three annotators to
perform the task. We give Turkers one example as a
guide along with the instructions.
4 Experiments and Results
The texts we use in our experiments are the develop-
ment set of the RTE-5 challenge (Bentivogli et al,

2009), and we preprocess the data using the Stan-
ford named-entity recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005).
In all, it contains 600 T-H pairs, and we use the texts
to generate facts and counter-facts and hypotheses as
references. We put our task online through Crowd-
Flower2, and on average, we pay one cent for each
(counter-)fact to the Turkers. CrowdFlower can help
with finding trustful Turkers and the data were col-
lected within a few hours.
To get a sense of the quality of the data we collect,
we mainly focus on analyzing the following three
aspects: 1) the statistics of the datasets themselves;
2) the comparison between the data we collect and
the original RTE dataset; and 3) the comparison be-
tween the facts and the counter-facts.
Table 1 show some basic statistics of the data we
collect. After excluding invalid and trivial ones3, we
acquire 790 facts and 203 counter-facts. In general,
the counter-facts seem to be more difficult to obtain
than the facts, since both the total number and the
average number of the counter-facts are less than
those of the facts. Notice that the NEs are not many
since they have to appear in both T and H.
The comparison between our data and the original
RTE data is shown in Table 2. The average length of
the generated hypotheses is longer than the original
hypotheses, for both the facts and the counter-facts.
Counter-facts seem to be more verbose, since addi-
tional (contradictory) information is added. For in-
stance, example ID 425 in Table 4, Counter Fact 1
can be viewed as the more informative but contra-
dictory version of Fact 1 (and the original hypoth-

esis). The average bag-of-words similarity scores
are calculated by dividing the number of overlap-
ping words of T and H by the total number of words
in H. In the original RTE dataset, the entailed hy-
potheses have a higher BoW score than the contra-
dictory ones; while in our data, facts have a lower
score than the counter-facts. This might be caused
by the greater variety of the facts than the counter-
facts. Fact 1 of example ID 425 in Table 4 is almost
the same as the original hypothesis, and Fact 2 of
example ID 374 as well, though the latter has some
slight differences which make the answer different
from the original one. The NE position in the sen-
tence is another aspect to look at. We find that peo-
ple tend to put the NEs at the beginning of the sen-
tences more than other positions, while in the RTE
datasets, NEs appear in the middle more frequently.
In order to get a feeling of the quality of the
data, we randomly sampled 50 generated facts and
counter-facts and manually compared them with the
original hypotheses. Table 3 shows that generated
facts are easier for the systems to recognize, and the
counter-facts have the same difficulty on average.
Although it is subjective to evaluate the difficulty
of the data by human reading, in general, we follow
the criteria that
1. Abstraction is more difficult than extraction;
2. Inference is more difficult than the direct en-
tailment;
3. The more sentences in T are involved, the more
difficult that T-H pair is.
Therefore, we view the Counter Fact 1 in example
ID 16 in Table 4 is more difficult than the original
hypothesis, since it requires more inference than the
direct fact validation. However, in example ID 374,
Fact 1 is easier to be verified than the original hy-
pothesis, and same as those facts in example ID 506.
Similar hypotheses (e.g. Fact 1 in example ID 425
and the original hypothesis) are treated as being at
the same level of difficulty.
After the quantitive analysis, let?s take a closer
look at the examples in Table 4. The facts are usually
constructed by rephrasing some parts of the text (e.g.
in ID 425, ?after a brief inspection? is paraphrased
by ?investigated by? in Fact 2) or making a short

percentage of the valid (counter-)facts; and other columns

summary (e.g. Fact 1 in ID 374, ?George Stranahan
spoke of Thompson?s death.?). For counter-facts, re-
moving the negation words or changing into another
adjective is one common choice, e.g. in ID 374,
Counter Fact 1 removed ?n?t? and Counter Fact 3
changed ?never? into ?fully?. The antonyms can
also make the contradiction, as ?rotten? to ?great?
in Counter Fact 2 in ID 374.
Example ID 506 in Table 4 is another interest-
ing case. There are many facts about Yemen, but
no valid counter-facts are generated. Furthermore,
if we compare the generated facts with the original
hypothesis, we find that people tend to give straight-
forward facts instead of abstracts4.
At last, we show some preliminary results on test-
ing a baseline RTE system on this dataset. For
the sake of comparison, we extract a subset of the
dataset, which is balanced on entailment and con-
tradiction text pairs, and compare the results with
the same system on the original RTE-5 dataset. The
baseline system uses a simple BoW-based similar-
ity measurement between T and H (Bentivogli et al,
2009) and the results are shown in Table 5.
The results indicate that our data are slightly ?eas-
ier? than the original RTE-5 dataset, which is consis-
tent with our human evaluation on the sampled data

clusions based on the simple baseline results.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we report our experience of using
MTurk to collect facts and counter-facts about the
given NEs and texts. We find that the generated hy-
potheses are not entirely the same as the original
hypotheses in the RTE data. One direct extension
would be to use more than one NE at one time, but it
may also cause problems, if those NEs do not have
any relations in-between. Another line of research
would be to test this generated resources using some
real existing RTE systems and compare the results
with the original RTE datasets, and also further ex-
plore the potential application of this resource.
