Abstract  
\Ve propose a two-layered model for computing se- 
mantic and (:onceI)tual interpretations from del)en- 
dency struetm'es. Abstract interl)retatio,t s(:hemata 
generate semantic interpretations of 'minimal' de- 
pendency sul)gral)hs , while production rules whose 
sl)eeitieation is rooted ill ontologi(:al categories de- 
rive a canonical con(:eptual i ~terl)retation from se- 
lna.ntic int;ert)retal;ion sl;ruel;ures. Configm'ational 
descriptions of del)endeney gral)hs increase the lin- 
guistic generality of interl)rel,ation s(:hemata, while 
interfimillg sehemata nd t)ro(htcl;ions t() lexi(:al and 
COll(:el)l:tl~ll (;lass hierarchies re(ht(:es the amount and 
complexity of semantic sl)e(:iti(:atJons. 
1 Introduct ion 
The syntax/semanti(:s interface has always t)een a 
matter of com:ern  for (:OllStit; l lell(:y-l)ased feal; l lre 
grammar theories (of., e.g., Creary an(1 Pollard 
( \ ]9S5) ,  ~.'~ooIx, ( i \[989), \ ] )ah'y l l l l ) le  (1.992), Wedekind 
and Kaplan (1993)). Within the dependen(:y gram- 
lllal' COllllllllllil;y: f3r loss at, te, ntion has 1)een l)ai(t t() 
l;his tel)it:. As a (:onse(tuen(:e, ther(~ is no consensus 
how syntactic del)en(lency structures might l)e a(t- 
e(tuately transl'()rm(~d into semanti(: interl)rel;aiions 
(el., naji~:ova (:t987), Milward (1992), Lombardo et 
al. (1998) for alt;ernative proposals). 
In this paper, we introduce, a two-layered inter- 
pretation model. In a first; pass, dependency graph 
structures which result fl'om in(:remental parsing are 
immediately submitted to a semantic intcrl)reta- 
tion process. Such a process is triggered by gen- 
eral schemata whenever a semantically interl)retable 
subgraph of a syntactic dependency gral)h t)ecomes 
ava.ilable (el. Section 3). As a result, lexical items 
and the del)endency relations holding 1)etwe.en them 
are directly mat)ped to associated concel)tual enti- 
ties mid relations at; the level of semantic represen- 
tation (cf. Sections 4 mtd 5). In a subsequent steI), 
the (quasi-inferential) iml)lications of the knowledge 
representation structures emerging from the seman- 
tic interpretation stet) are accounted for l)y a pro- 
eess we here refer to as concepl, 'aal interpretation. 
The (:orresl)onding ot)erations relate to the (:(mcel)- 
tua\] representation level only and are triggered by 
a variety of production rules rooted in ontological 
categories in order to generate a canonical concep- 
tual representation f the parsed sentence (el. Sec- 
tion 6). This second level of interpretation is usually 
not taken into consideration by computational mod- 
els of semantic interpretation, either constituency- 
based nor (lei)endency-based ones, although it turns 
out to crucial for natural anguage ',,ndeTwtandin.q. 
2 Grammar  and Concept Knowledge 
Grammatical knowledge for syntactic analysis is 
t)ased on a fully texicalized dependency gl'alllltla\] 
(Itahn et al, 1994). ()ur preference for dependency 
structures is motivated, among other things, t)y the 
observation that the corresl)ondence of det)endency 
relations (holding between lexical items) to con(:ep- 
tual relations (holding between the, concepts they 
denote) is much closer than t.'or constituency-based 
grammars (Ilajicova, 1987). Ilence, a dependency- 
based al)i)roach cases inherently the descrit)tion of 
the regularities mMerlying selnantic inl;erl)retation. 
In this lexicalized el)endeney framework, lexeme 
sl)eeitications form the leaf nodes of a lexicon I)AG, 
which are further al)sl:racted in terms of lexeme 
class specilical;ions at different levels of generalit:y 
(of. Figure 1), This lea& to a lexeme (:lass hier- 
archy, which consists of lexeme (:lass names 142 :=

i tance  of grammar knowledge is based on the idea 
that constraints are attached to the most general 
lexeme classes to which they apply, leaving room for 
more and more specific (possibly, even idiosyncratic) 
specifications when one descends this hierarchy. 
A dependency grammar captures binary con- 
straints between a syntactic head (e.g., a noun) and 
one of its possible modifiers (e.g., a determiner or 
an adjective). In order to establish a dependency 
relation ~ C :D := {specifier, s~fl~iect, dirobject, ...} 
between a head and a Inodifier, lexenle-class-specific 
constraints oil word order, comt)atit)ility of Inor- 
phosyntactic features and senmntic integrity must 
be fiflfilled. Figure 2 depicts a dependency graph in 
which word nodes are given in bold face and depen- 
dency relations are indicated I)y labeled edges. 
Conceptual knowledge of the underlying domain is 
expressed in terms of a KL-ONE-like knowledge rep- 
resentation language (Woods and Schmolze, 1992). 
The domain ontology consists of a set of concei)t 
names 9 r := {COMPANY,  tIAI~I)-.DI.g\[<, ...} and a sub- 
sunlI)tion relation i saf  = {(HAIiD-DISK, NTOHACF- 
DFVICF), (TRANS'rI.:(~', COMPANY), ...} C ~P x 
Y.  The set of re lat ion nantes ?g : - -  {IIAS-t'All;F~ 
I )EI,  IVE I~-AGENT,  . . .}  denotes con(:eptual relations 
which are also organized in a subsmnption hierarchy 
isa?z = {(ttAS-IIARI)-DISK, ItAS-PItYSICAL-PAVI'), 
( I lAS -PHYS ICAL-PAR.T ,  I tA.q-PAltSI ' ) ,  . . .} .1 Examples 
of emerging concept mid relation hierarchies are de- 
picted in Figure 3 (right box). 
Ill our at)proach, the representation languages for 
semantics and domain knowledge coincide (for argu- 
ments supporting this view, el. Allen (1993)). Link- 
ing lexical items and concet)tual entities proceeds 
as follows: Upon entering the parsing process, each 
lexical itern w that has a (:onceptual correlate C in 
the domain knowledge base, w.C E Y (mostly verbs, 
Ilouns and adjectives), gets immediately instantiated 
in the knowledge base, such that for any instance Iw, 
initially, 2 type(I,,) = w.C holds (e.g., w = :'Fest- 
platte", I,,, = HAI{D-Dlst,:.2, w.C = type(HaI~.D- 
DISK.2) = HARD-DISK). If several conceptual cor- 
relates exist, either due to honmnymy or polysemy, 
I Atl sllbstllnpl;ioIl ,elations, isaw, isa:v, and isw~, arc 
considered to be transitive and reflexive. 
2For instance, anaphora might necessitate changes of this 
initial reference assignment, el. Strube and Ilahn (1999).

3 Interpretable Subgraphs 
II1 the parse tree from Figure 2, we can distinguish 
lexical nodes that have a conceptual correlate (e.g., 
"Fcstplatte" relating to HAl{D-DIsK, "gelicfert " re- 
lating to DEIAVh;RY) from others that do not have 
Such a correlate (e.g., "mit" (with), "yon" (by)). Se- 
mantic interpretation capitalizes oil this distinction 
in order to tind adequate conceptual relations be- 
tween the corresl)onding concept, insta.nces: 
D i rect  L inkage.  If two word no(tes with (:oncet)- 
tual correlates are linked by a single depen(ten(:y re- 
lation, a direct linkage is given. Such a subgraph 
can immediately be interpreted in ternis of a (:on- 
ceptual relation licensed by the correspondiitg de- 
l)endency relation. This is illustrated in Figure 2 by 
the direct linkage between "Festplatte" (hard disk) 
and "Computers" via the gen\[itive\]att\[ribut(~\] rela- 
tion, which gets nmpped to tile IIARD-DISK-OF role 
linking the corresponding con(:eptual correlates, viz. 
HARD-DISK.2 alld C()MPUTER-,~YSTFM.4, respec- 
tively (see Figure 4). This interpretation uses only 
knowledge about the concet)tual correlates and the 
linking dependency relation.

dency relations and none of tile il ltervening no(les 
have a conceptual correlate, an indirect linkage is 
given. For such a "nfinimal" sut)grat)h, semantic in- 
tert)retal;ion is made dependent on lexical informa- 
tion from the, intervening nodes, as well as knowledge 
aboul; the conceptual correlates and del)cn(lency i'e- 
lations. Figure 2 il lustrates such a eontiguration 
lay tile linkage between "Com,putcr.s" and "350Mhz- 
CPU"  via the intervening node "mit" (will O and 
the pI)att\[ributc\] mid l>objc, ct relations, the re, suit <)f 
which is a conceptual linkage between COMI'UTFI/.- 
SYSTI,'M.4 and 350N/IIIZ-Cl'U.6 via the relation HAS- 
CI'U in Figure 4. 
In oMer to increase tile generality and to t)reserve 
the simi)licity of semantic interpretat ion we intro- 
duce a generalization of the notion of del)emlency 
relation such that it incorporates direct as well as 
indirect linkage: Two content words (nouns, adjec- 
tives, adverbs or flfll verl)s) stand in a 'me.dialed syn- 
tactic relation, if one can t)ass from one word to 
the other along the connecting edges of the (tcl)en- 
(tency gral)h wit;hour traversing word nodes other 
than t)repositions, modal or auxil iary verl)s (i.e., el- 
ements of eh)sed woM classes). In Figure 2, e.g., 
the tuples ( "Fcstplattc.", "Co'm,p',,ter.s ") or ( "6'om,- 
putcrs", "350Mh, z-CPU") stand in mediated syntac- 
t i t  relations, whereas, e.g,, the tuple ("Fest, plattc", 
"Tra'nstcc") does not, since the comiecting 1)ath COlt- 
rains "gelicfc.rt" (dclivcrcd), a (;Ollt;elll; word. 
This leads to the following detinition: Let w and 
'w' be l, wo  (:onl;enI; words  in a senten( ; ( ;  ,5'. 1111 addi- 
l;i(-)n, lel; 'w2 , . . .  , 'wn-1 E S ('11, ~ 2) l)e l / re l )os i l ; i ons  , 
auxil iary or modal verl)s, and wl := 'w an(1 w,  := 
'u/. Then we say thaJ; 'w and 'w' st:and in a 'nt(:diat('d 
syntactic r(:lat, ion, iff there exists an inde.x I C {1, 
. . . ,  n} so that the following two (:on(litions hold: 
1. 'wi is modifier of'wi+l for i C {1, . . . ,  l-1}; 
2. wi is head of wi+\] for i E {I , . . . ,  n- l}. 
We call a subgral)h identitie(1 t)y su(:h a s(!rics 'w j, 
. . .  , w ,  a, sc'm, anl, ically intcrFrc, tabh', .s"u, bgraph, of 1;11(,' 
dependency graph of S. The, detinMon of a medi- 
ated syntactic relation encoml)asses the notion of a 
direct linkage (n := 2, so t;hat an empty set of in- 
tervening nodes emerges). The special eases 1 := 1 
and I := n yield an ascending and descending series 
of head-modif ier relations, resl)ectively.

semantic level is achieved in a strictly COml)ositional

Dynamic Constraint Processing. Semantic 
interpretation implies a search in the knowledge base 
which takes the constraints into account that de- 
rive fl'om a particular dependency parse tree. Two 
sorts of knowledge then lmve to be combined - -  first, 
a pair of concepts for which a connecting relation 
path has to be determined; second, conceptual COl> 
straints on permitted and excluded conceptual rela- 
tions when connected relations are being computed. 
The first constraint ype ineorporates the content 
words linked by the semantically interpretable sub- 
graph, the latter accounts for the pm'ticular depen- 
dency relation(s) holding between them. Schema (1) 
describes the most general mapping fl'om the coil- 
ceptual correlates, h.Cfrom and 11t.Cto~ ill ~ of tile 
two syntactically linked lexical items, h and m, re- 
spectively, to connected relation paths 12~o,,.. 
)c x 2 ~ x 2 v? x .7 -~ 2/~ .... 
";: (CI,.o,,~ , 12+, 12- ,  C,o) ~ 12~o~,, (1) 
A connected relation path rel~o,, C R .... is defined 
by: 
relcon((rt,..., rn)) :?:;' Vi C {1, ..., n - 1} : 
A relation path is called connected, if for all its n 
constituent, noncomposite relations ri the concept 
type of the domain of the relation ri+l subsumes 
the concept ype of the range of the relation ri. 
To compute a semantic interpretatiol~, si triggers 
a search through the knowledge base and identifies 
all commeted relation paths from Cf~.o,, to Cto. Due 
to potential conceptual ambiguities in interpreting 
syntactic relations, more than one such path may 
exist (hence, we mat) to the power set of 12~o,~). In 
order to constrain connectivity, si takes into con- 
sideration all conceptual relations 12+ C Td a priori 
permitted for semantic interpretation, as well as all 
relations R_ C 7~ a priori excluded. Both of them re- 
flect the constraints set 11 t) by particular (lel)endency 
relations or non-content words figuring as lexical re- 
lators of content words. Thus, tel G R~o,, holds, if 
tel is a connected relation path from Cf,.o,,~ to Cto, 
obeying the restrictions imposed by 12+ and 12_. 
If the fllnction si returns the empty set (i.e., no 
valid interpretation can be comtmted), no depen- 
dency relation will be estat)lished. Otherwise, tbr 
all resulting relation paths RELi E I~con an asser- 
tional axiom of tile form (h.Cfro,n I~.ELi m.Cto) is 
added to the knowledge base, where RELi denotes 
tile i th reading. If i > 1, conceptual ambiguities oc- 
cur, resolution strategies for which m'e described ill 
Romaclmr and Hahn (2000a). 
To match a concept definition C against ile con- 
straints imposed by 12+ and 12_, we define the func- 
tion get-roles(C) =: CR, where C12 denotes the set 
of conceptual roles associated with C, which are then 
used as starting points for the path search. For ease 
and generality of st)ecification , R+ and li~_ consist of 
the most general conceptual relations only. Hence, 
the concrete conceptual roles CR and the general 
ones in R+ and R_ may not always be compatible. 
So prior to semantic interpretation, we expand I2+ 
and R_ into their transitive closures, incort)orating 
all their subrelations in the relation hierarchy. Thus, 
12; :-- { ,.* e I ,' 12+ : is,  ,. }. R*_ is 
correspondingly defined. 12+ restricts the search to 
relations contained in C12 rq 12"4-, iffR+ is not empty 
(otherwise, all elements of C12 are allowed), whereas 
12_ allows only for relations in C12 \ 12"_. 
5 A Sample  Semant ic  In terpretat ion  
Whenever a semantically interpretable subgraph is 
complete, selnantic interpretation gets started inl- 
mediately. As an example, we will consider a case of 
indirect linkage, as illustrated by the occurrence of 
auxiliary and modal verbs within a passive clause. 
When interpreting indirect syntactic relations, in- 
fl)rmation not only about content word nodes but 
also about intervening noncontent word nodes be- 
comes available. This way, further static constraints 
are imposed on R+ (and 12_) in terms of a list RI~.~. 
C T~. of permitted conceptual relations. This infor- 
mation is always specified at the lexcme level. Since 
12t~:~ relates to closed-class i|;ems only, the required 
nmnber of specifications i easy to survey. 
In our example (ef. Figure 2), the content words 
"Festplatte" (h, ard disk) and "flcliefcrt" (dclivered) 
are linked by a mediating modal verb ("lvann" (can)) 
and a passive auxiliary (%;erden" (bq ..... i,,c)). The 
semantic interI)retation schema tbr passive auxil- 
im'ies (2) addresses the concept ype of the instance 
fbr their syntactic subject, Cs,o,j = t!/pe(I.~ul, j) = 
HARI)-DISK, and that tbr their verbpart, C,,e,,1,pa,.t 
= type(Iv~:,.bv~rt) = DELIVERY. The relation be- 
tween these two, however, is determined by Rva**a,~:~. 
:= {PATIENT, CO-PATIENT}, constraint knowledge 
which resides in the lexeme specification for %mr- 
den" as passive auxiliary (of. Figure 1). 
: , , 12 o,,, (2) 
With sia,,x(DELIVEI{Y, {PATIENT, CO-PATIENT}, 
~, HAIl.D-DISK), we get the concet)tual relation 
DEH\ Ea-IATmNT (of. Figure 3), since HM{D-DISK 
is subsumed by PI~ODUCT and, thus, a legal filler of 
DELIVER-PATIENT C 12passaux" 
6 Conceptua l  In terpretat ion  
Conceptual interpretation uses a production rule sys- 
tem (Yen et al, 1991.) which accounts for charac- 
teristic patterns of assertions that result froth the 
semantic interpretation process. While the outcome 
of semantic intert)retation (cf. Figure 4) still adheres 
274

As an exanq)le of such inferences consider Figure

7 Evaluat ion 
We evaluated this approach to senmntie intert)reta- 
tion on a random selection of 54 texts (comprising 
18,500 words) from two text corpora, viz. consumer 
product test reports and medical finding reports. 
For evaluation purposes, we concentrated on the in- 
terpretation of genitives (as an instance of direct 
linkage) and on the interpreta.tion of t)eriphrastic 
verbal complexes, i.e., passive, temporal and modal 
constructions (as instances of indirect linkage). 
The underlying ontology consists of an upper 
generic part (containing about 1,500 concepts and 
relations) and domain-specific extensions relating to 
information technology (IT) and (parts of) mmtomi- 
cal medicine (MED). Each of these two dolnain mod- 
els adds about 1,400 concepts and relations to the 
upper model. Corresponding lexeme entries in the 
lexicon provide linkages to the entire ontology. 
We considered a total of 247 genitives in the smn- 
ple. Recall was higher for medical texts (57%) than 
for IT documents (31%), though, in general, rather 
low. However, precision peaked at 97% and 94% fo," 
medical and IT texts, respectively. The mnnt)er of 
syntactic onstructions with modal verbs or auxil- 
iaries amour to 292 exmnples. Compared to geni- 
tives, we obtained a slightly more favorable recall 
for both doinains 66% tbr MED, 40% for IT - - ,  
while precision dropped slightly to 95% and 85% for 
nmdical and IT documents, respectively. 4 
As with any such evaluation, idiosyncrasies of the 
(;overage of the knowledge bases are inevitably tied 
with the results and, thus, put limits on too far- 
reaching generalizations. However, our data reflect 
the intention to submit a knowledge-intensive text 
un(lerstmlder to a realistic, i.e., conceptually un- 
constrained and therefore "unfriendly" test environ- 
ment. Judged from tile figures of our recall data, 
there is no doubt, whatsoever, that conceptual cov- 
erage of the domain constitutes the bottleneck for 
any knowledge-based approach to NLP. s Sublan- 
guage differences are also mirrored systematically in 
these data, since medical texts adhere more closely 
to well-established concept axonomies and writing 
standards than magazine articles ill the IT domain, 
whose rhetorical styles vary to a larger degree. 
8 Re lated  Work 
The standard way of deriving a semantic interpre- 
tation for constituency-based grammars is to assign 
each syntactic rule one or more semantic interpreta- 
tion rules (e.g., van Eijck and Moore (1992)), and to 
4A more detailed presentation of this evaluation study is 
given in Romacker and Itahn (20001)). 
5For the medical domain at least, we are currently actively 
pursuing research on the semiautomatic creation of large-scale 
ontologies from weak knowledge sources, viz. medical termi- 
nologies; cf. Schulz and Hahn (2000). 
determine the meaning of the syntactic head fl'om its 
constituents. This approach as also been adopted 
in the few explicit attempts at incorporating seman- 
tic interpretation i to a dependency grmninar fi'mne- 
work (Milward, 1992; Lombardo et al, 1998). There 
are no constraints on how to design and orgmfize this 
rule set despite those that are imI)lied by the choice 
of the semantic theory. In particular, abstraction 
mechanisms (going beyond the level of sortal tax- 
onomies for semantic labels, cf., e.g., Creary and 
Pollard (1985)), such as property inheritance, de- 
faults, are lacking. Accordingly, the number of rules 
increases rapidly and easily reaches orders of sev- 
eral lmndreds in a real-world setting (Bean cta l . ,  
1998). As an alternative, we provide a small set 
of gencric semantic interpretation schemata (by the 
order of 10) and conceptual interpretation rules (by 
the order of 30 for 200 verb concepts) instead of 
assigning specific interpretation rules to each gram- 
mar item (in our case, single lexemes), and incor- 
porate inheritance-based abstraction in the use of 
these schemata during the intert)retation process in 
the knowledge base. We clearly want to point out 
that while this rule system covers a wide variety 
of standard syntactic constructions (such as gent- 
tives, prepositional phrases, various tense and modal 
forms), it currently does not account fbr quantifica- 
tional issues (like scope ambiguities) for which en- 
tirely logic-based approach (Charniak and Goldman, 
1988; Moore, 1989; Pereira and Pollack, 1991) pro- 
vide quite sophisticated solutions. 
Sondheilner et al (1984) and Itirst (1988) treat 
semantic interpretation as a direct mapt)ing front 
syntactic to conceptual rel)resentations. They also 
shm:e with us tim representation f doinain knowl- 
edge using Kl,-ONE-style terminological languages, 
and, hence, they nmke heavy use of property inher- 
itance (or typing) inechanisms. The main diflbrence 
to our approach lies in the status of the semantic 
rules. Sondheimer et al (1984) attach single in- 
terpretatiotl rules to each r'olc (filler) and, hence, 
have to provide utterly detailed specifications re- 
flecting the idiosyncrasies of each semantically rele- 
vant (role) attachment. Property inheritmme comes 
only into play when the selection of alternative se- 
mantic rules is constrained to the one(s) inherited 
from the most specific case frame. In a similar way, 
Hirst (1988) uses strong typing at the coueeptual 
object level only, while we use it simultaneously at 
the grmnmar and the domain knowledge level for the 
processing of semantic schemata. 
9 Conclus ions 
We introduced an al)proach to the design of com- 
pact, yet highly expressive senmntic interpretation 
sdmmata. They derive their power from two sources. 
First;, the organization of grammar and domain 
276 
knowledge, its well as semantic interpretation mcch- 
alliSllIS: al'e lmsed on inheritance principles. Soc- 
ou(1, interpretation schemata l)stract from 1)articu- 
lar linguistic phenomena (spe('ilic lexical items, lex- 
eme classes or dependency relations) ill terms of gen- 
eral contiguration l)atterns in (tepo.nden(-y gral)hs. 
Underlying these design decisions is a strict sep- 
aration of linguistic and eouceptual knowledge. A 
clearly defined interface is provided which a.llows 
these st)ecitications to nmke reference to line-grained 
hierarchical knowledge, no ma.tter whether it is of 
gramnmtical or conceptual origin. The interface is 
divided into two levels. O11o nmkes use of static, 
high-level (:onstraints ut)l)lied l)y the nlal)l)ing of 
syntactic to conceptual roles or sut/1)lied its the 
meaning of closed word classes. The other uses these 
constraints in a dynanfic search through a knowl- 
edge base, that is l/arametrized by few and simI)le 
schenmta. Finally, at the level of conceptual in- 
terprotatiou inferences emerging fl'om senmntic rq)- 
resentations are COml)uted by a s(.'l; of t)roductious 
which make reference to a verbcategorial hierarchy. 
Also since the numl)er of s(:hentata at the semantic 
description layer remains ratho.r sulall, their o.x('.cu- 
tion is easy to tra(:e and thus SUl)l)orts the main- 
tenanco of largo-scale NLP systenls. The high ab- 
straction level 1)rovided by inheritance-based seman- 
tic sl)ecilications allows easy 1)orting across (liflhr- 
ent al)l)lication domains. Our exl)orienco resls on
