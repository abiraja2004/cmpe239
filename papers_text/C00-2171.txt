1 Introduction 
This paper describes a framework for multilingual 
inheritance-based lexical representation which aP 
lows sharing of information across (related) hm- 
guages at all levels of linguistic description. Most 
work on multilingual lexicons up to now has as- 
sumed mouolingual lexicons linked only at the level 
of semantics (MUI_TILEX 1993; Copestake t al. 
1992). Cahill and Gazdar (1999) show that this 
approach might be appropriate for unrelated lan- 
guages, as for example English and Japanese, but 
that it makes it impossible to capture useful gener- 
alisations about related languages - such as English 
and German. Related languages share many linguis- 
tic characteristics at all levels of description - syn- 
tax, morphology, phonology, etc. - not just seman- 
tics. For instance, words which come fl'om a single 
root have very similar orthographic and phonologi- 
cal forms. Compare English, Dutch, and German1:

Most differences can be attributed to dil'ferent 
orthographic conventions and regular phonological 
changes (e.g. final devoicing in Dutch and German). 
The English/{I, the Dutch/AI, and the German/a/ 
in the last two exmnples, are even virtually the same. 
They have slightly different realisations but they are 
phonologically non-distinctive, i.e. if the Dutch/A/ 
were substituted by the English/{/in Dutch, the re- 
sult would not be a different word, but it would sim- 
ply sound like a different accent. 
Cahill and Gazdar (I 999) describe an architecture 
for nmltilingual lexicons which aims to encode and 
exploit lexical similarities between closely related 
languages. This architecture has been successfully 
applied in the PolyLex project 2 to define a trilingual 
lexicon for Dutch, English, and German sharing 
morphological, phonological, and lnorphophono- 
logical information between these languages. 
in this paper, we will take the Polykex fiame- 
work as our basis. We will focus on the phono- 
logical similarities between related hmguages and 
we will extend the PolyLex approach by capturing 
cross-linguistic phoneme correspondences, such as 
the/{/-/A/-/a/correspondence mentioned above 3. 
First, we will discuss how a phoneme inventory 
can be defined for a group of languages - l)utch,

exlended to a featural evel, but for tile present purposes we

English, and German. Then, we will explain tile 
multilingual architecture used in PolyLex. Finally, 
we will explore how these cross-linguistic phoneme 
correspoudences can be integrated into tile multilin- 
gual frmnework. 
2 A Metaphoneme Inventory 
In this section we describe how a phoneme inven- 
tory can be defined for a group of languages in 
which language-specific phonemes flmction its "al- 
lophones" of newly defined metaphonemes. We will 
restrict ourselves to the vowel phonemes of l)utch, 
English, and Gerlnan. If we know, for example, 
that words which are realised with an /{I in En- 
glish are usually realised with an/A/ in I)utch, and 
an/a / in  German (as in hand/h{nd/ versus/hAnt/ 
w:rsus/hant/, cal/k{t/versus/kArl versus/kats(@/, 
elc.), we might be able to generalise over these three 
hmguage-specific phonemes and introduce a meta- 
phoneme, e.g. I{Aa\], which captures this generali- 
sation. 
To give an impression of the distribution of the 
different vowel phonemes across l)utch, English, 
and German, their vowel charts (K6nig and van der 
Auwera 1994; Wells 1989) were merged into one 
big vowel chart containing all the vowel phonemes 
of these three hmguages. 4, The resulting char| is

anything about cross-linguistic phoneme correspon- 
deuces. Knowing that Dutch and German both have 
a phoneme/o:/, does not mean that they are cross- 
linguistically non-distinctive. 
qb find cross-linguistic phoneme correspon- 
deuces, we followed O'Connor's (1973) strategy 
for establishing phonelne conespondences between 
difl'erent accents, identifying phonemes of one ac- 
cent with those el' another: 
"How are we to decide whether to equate 
phoneme X with phoneme A or with 
phoneme D? We can do so only on the 
basis el' the words in which they occur: 
if X and A both occur in a large number 
of words common to both accents we link 
them together as representing the same 
point on the pattern, if, on the other hand, 
X shares more words with D than with A, 
we l inkXandD.  \[...\] Even so, i fXand  
D occur in a very similar word-set and X 
and A do not, then it is much more reveal- 
ing to equate X and D than X and A." 
(O'Connor 1973, p. 186) 
We extended O'Connor's trategy and applied it 
to a group of (closely) related hmguages haring 
a co lnmou word  stock - in our case  a s l lbset  o f  
the West Gmmanic languages haring worcls with 
a common Germanic origin. We compiled a list 
of g00 (mono- and disyllabic) Germanic ognates, 
looked up the transcriptions in the CELEX database 
(Baayen el al. 1995), and then mapped words con- 
tainiug a palticular vowel in one hmguage onto its 
cognates in the other two hmguages to see how this 
particular vowel was realised in tile other two lan- 
guages. This process was repeated for all the vow- 
els, for all three languages. 
A few examples of tile results we obtained for En- 
glish vowels are included below c'. 
As can be seen fl'om these v, tlaere is some vari- 
ation in the closeness of the correspondences. The 
vowel set /{/ - /A/ - /a/ ,  as we anticipated at the out- 
set, does turn out to be a wflid correspondence. The 
set associated with English/i:/, on the other hand, 
is less clearcut, as there are several possible cor-

ties of the words in question. Currently the mapping

sophisticated analysis, phonological and phonotac- 
tic information would need to be considered as well. 
Howcvel; even at the present level of analysis, the 
metaphoneme principle can be helpful in the mul- 
tilingual lexical structure proposed, as we now dis- 
CUSS. 
3 The  mul t i l i ngua l  inher i tance  l ex icon  
In this section, we will explore the sharing of phono- 
logical information in the lexical entries of a mul- 
tilingual inheritance-based lexicon. We focus on 
phonology rather than orthography as phonology is 
nearer to primary language use (i.e. spoken lan- 
guage), it can be used as input for hyphenation rules, 
spelling correction, and it is essential as the level of 
symbolic representation for speech synthesis (MUD 
TILEX 1993). 
1128 
We will take the multilingual architecture of 
PolyLex as our starting point. First, we will describe 
the PolyLex arclaitecture. Then, we will show how 
phonological information can be shared in the lexi- 
cal entries. 
PolyLex detines a multilingual inheritance-based 
lexicon for l)utch, English and German. It is 
implemented in DATR, an inheritance-based lexi- 
cal knowledge representation formalism (Evans and 
Gazdar 1996). The rationale of inheritance-based 
lexicons requires information to be pushed as far up 
the hierarchy as it can go, generalising as much as 
possible. In a multilingual exicon, this means that 
information which is common to several anguages 
is stated at higher points in the hierarchy than that 
which is unique to just one of the languages. In 
addition, Polykex makes use of orthogonal multiple 
inheritance which allows a node in the hierarchy to 
inherit different kinds of information (e.g. seman- 
tics, morphology, phonology, syntax) fi'om different 
parent nodes. In this papen we are just interested in 
the phonological hierarchy. 
Polykex assumes a contemporary phonological 
fralnework in which all lexical entries are detined 
as having a phonological structure consisting of a 
sequence of structured syllables, a syllable consist- 
ing o1' an onset (the initial consonant cluster, which 
might be split up into onset 1, onset 2, etc.) and a 
rhylne. The rhyme consists of a peak (the vowel) 
and a coda (the final consonant cluster, which might 
bc split up into coda 1, coda 2, etc.). This struc- 
ture is defined at the top el' the hierarchy, and ap- 
plies by default o all words. Only the relevant val- 
ues for onset, peal<, and coda have to be defined at 
the individual exical entries (see Cahill and Gazdar 
1!)97). Following PolyLex we will concentrate on a 
segmental phonelnic representation. An example of 
the lexical entry gram as it would be represented in
PolyLex, is shown in figure 2. 
The multilingual phonological entry for gram, is 
delined by sharing identical segments occnrring in 
the majority of the language-specific entries (/gr{m/ 
- /xrAm/-/gram/).  That is, onset 1 is/g/, onset 2 is 
/1"/, and coda is/m/. 
English and German can inherit all the informa- 
tion fiom the common part except for the value of 
their peak, which is respectively /{/ and /a/. In 
Dutch, the value of the peak has to be specified as 
being/A/, plus we will have to override the wdue 
for the first onset o get \[xrAm\]. 
This example misses the generalisation that the 
Peak = {

phonologically non-distinctive. For each lexical ca- 
try where English uses/{/, l)utch/A/, and German

language-specific parts. By using the metaphoneme 
I{Aal instead, this information needs to be speci- 
fied only once. The resulting multilingual phonemic 
representation for gram is given in ligure 3.

far as it can go, capturing as many generalisations 
as possible. The information that \]{Aa\] results ill 
an/{/in English, an/A/in Dutch, and an/a/in Ger- 
man is specified only at the top level. The language- 
specitic boxes are almost empty, except for the value 
of the first onset in Dutch. The reason for this is 
that as yet we have only defined cross-linguistic 
phoneme correspondences for vowels, not for con- 
sonants. We do, howevm, suspect that the Dutch/x/ 
is phonologically non-distinctive fi'om the German 
and English /g/. Further research defining cross- 
linguistic phoneme correspondences forconsonants 
1129 
will have to confirm this. 
It is a fundamental feature of this account that 
the inherited information is only default informa- 
tion which can be overridden. Thus, it is not re- 
quired that metaphoneme correspondences are com- 
plete and we may choose to use a metaphoneme 
even if one of the languages uses a different vowel 
in some words. The definitions can be overridden 
in exactly the same way as the onset definition in 
Dutch in the example above. So if we consider the 
vowel correspondences in table 1, we can see that 
of the 35 words which have cognates in all three 
languages, 27 can be defined as having the meta- 
phoneme \[{Aa I in the common lexical entry (those 
for which both English and l)utch have the corre- 
sponding vowels). Five of these will require a sep- 
arate vowel defined for Gerlnan, while the remain- 
der will need separate vowel definitions for all three 
languages. 
Given this, we can see that economy of rep- 
resentation can be achieved even in cases where 
the vowel correspondences are far from conclusive. 
Even if only half or fewer of the Dutch words, for 
example, have the same vowel in cognates for which 
the English words have the same vowel, this still 
means that those half can be defined without the 
need for the language-specific vowel to be defined. 
Another feature of the metaphoneme principle 
that differentiates it from the phonemic principle 
is that there is no requirement for biuniqueness. 
A phoneme in a language can be a realisation of 
morn than one metaphoneme. This means that we 
can define a metaphoneme I{Aa\[ as well as another, 
IA:Aal. Each of these will then be used in different 
common lexical entries. This can be used as an al- 
ternative to phonological/phonotactic conditioning 
or in addition to it, for just those cases where there 
is more than one correspondence but no obvious 
phonologicai/phonotactic onditioning for the deci- 
sion between phonemes. 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have discussed the concept of 
metaphonemes. Metaphonemes are cross-linguistic 
phoneme correspondences such as the English/{/, 
the Dutch/A/,  and the German/a/correspondence 
inentioned above. At the lnultilingual level, the 
realisation of the metaphoneme is conditioned by 
the choice of language. At the lower monolingual 
level its realisation as an allophone of a particular 
phoneme is conditioned by the phonological envi- 
romnent. As such, a metaphoneme is a generalisa- 
tion of a generalisation. 
We have shown how a metaphoneme inventory 
can be defined for a group of languages and that 
incorporating these cross-linguistic phoneme corre- 
spondences in a multilingual inheritance lexicon in- 
creases the number of generalisations that can be 
captured. Calculations on the syllable inventories of 
Dutch, English, and German in the CELEX database 
show that the introduction of metaphonemes in- 
creases the amount of sharing at the syllable level 
by about 25%. 
Another benefit of introducing metaphonemes is 
improved robustness in NLP systems. Knowledge 
about cross-linguistic ommonalities can help to 
provide grounds for making an "intelligent" guess 
when a lexical item for a particular language is not 
present. 
Tiffs research as concentrated on cross-linguistic 
vowel phoneme correspondences. Similar research 
will be done for consonants.
