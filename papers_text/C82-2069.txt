The use of p red ic t ion  as the bas is  fo r  in fe rent ia l  
ana lys i s  mechanisms fo r  natura l  language has become increas -  
ing ly  popular  in  recent  years .  Examples of systems which use  
pred ic t ion  are FRUMP (DeJong 79) and(Schank 75a) .  The proper -  
ty  of in teres t  here i s  that  the i r  bas ic  mode of work i~ i s  to 
determine whether an input  text  fo l lows one of the systems 
p~s-spec i f ied  pat terns ;  in  o ther  words they pred ic t ,  to some 
extent ,  the form the i r  input  texts  w i l l  take .  A c ruc ia l  pro-  
blem for  such systems i s  the se lec t ion  of su i tab le  sets  of 
p red ic t ions ,  or  pat terns ,  to be app l ied  to  any par t i cu la~ 
text ,  and  i t  i s  th i s  problem 1 want to address in  the paper.  
I w i l l  assume that  the pred ic t ions  are organised i n to  
bundles  acoord i~ to the top is  of the texts  to which they 
apply .  This i s  a genera l i sa t ion  of the sc r ip t  idea  employed 
b~ (DeJong 79) and (Schank75a). l w i l l  ca l l  such bundles

The bas is  of the techn ique descr ibed here i s  a d i s t inc t -  
i on  between the process of su~est in~ poss ib le  top ics  of a 
sect ion  of text  and the process of e l im inat in~ candidate  
top ics  (and assoc ia ted  pred ic t ions )  which are not ,  in  fac t ,  
appropr ia te  fo r  the text  sect ion .  Those cand idates  which are 
not  e l im inated  are then  ident i f ied  as the top ics  of the text  
- 281  - 
sect ion .  (There may on ly  be one such cand idate . )  This approach 
a l lows the use o f  a lgor i thms fo r  suggest ing  poss ib le  top ics  
which t ry  to ensure that  i f  the system possesses  a su i tab le  
s te reotype  fo r  a text  sec t ion  i t  i s  ac t ivated ,  even at  the 
expense of  ac t ivat ing  la rEe  numbers of  i r re levant  s te reotypes .  
This techn ique  has been tes ted  in  a computer system 
ca l led  Scrabb le .  
2! Su~est in~ Candidate Topics 
The d i scovery  of  cand idate  top ics  fo r  a text  secant  i s  
d r iven  by the assoc ia t ion  of  a se t  of  pat te rns  of  sen~nt io  
p r imi t ives  w i th  each s tereotype .  (For  the purposes of  th i s  
paper i t  i s  assumed that  the system has access  to  a lex icon  
conta in ing  ent r ies  whose semant ic  component 18 something l i ke  
that  used by (Wilks 77) . )  As a word i s  input  to the system 
the senses  of  the  word are examined to determine i f  any of  
them have a semant ic  descr ip t ion  which conta ins  a pat tern  
assoc ia ted  w i th  any of  the system s s te reotypes .  I f  any do 
conta in  such a pat tern  the cor respond ing  s tereotypes  axe 
loaded in to  the ac t ive  workepace of  the syste  m, un less  they 
are  a l ready  ac t ive .

In  para l le l  w i th  the suggest ion  process ,  the pred iot ionm 
of  each s tereotype  in  the ac t ive  workspace are  compared wi th  
the  text .  In  Scrabb le ,  the sentences  of  the text  a re  f i r s t  
parsed in to  a var iant  of  Conceptual  Dependency (CD) represent -  
a t ion  (Schank 75b) by a program descr ibed  in  (Cater  80) .  The 
semant ic  representat ion  scheme lxas been extended to inc lude  
nominal descr ip t ions  s imi la r  in  power to those  used by (Wilke 
77) .  The~pred ic t ions  are compared wi th  the CD representat ion

4,  Jbl EXample 
Consider  the ~ollowAng shor t  text ,  adapted from (Char- 
nAak 78) ,  
Jaok ptoked a oem of tuna  e l f  the she l f ,  He put i t  in  
h ie  basket .  He psAd fo r  i t  and went home. 
Assume that  assoc ia ted  with the pr imi t ive  pat tern  fo r  
food the system has s tereotypes  fo r  eattnK in  a res ter ,  
shopping at  a supermarket ,  and prepar t~ a ms8~ In  the k i tch -  
en,  The Xextoon en.tz7 fo r  tuna  (a la rge  sea f leh  whloh 18 
Qaught fo r  food) wal l  ?ontaAn th i s  pat tern ,  and th i s  wa l l  
oause the load lng  of the above three  s tereotypes  in to  the 
ac t ive  workspaoe. The res taurant  s te reotype  w i l l  not  p red ic t

the supermarket and k i tchen  s tereotypes  expect sentences  l l ke

the f i r s t  in  the text .  When the sco ld  sentence  i8  read ,  the 
supermarket s te reotype  w i l l  be q~xpeoting i t  ( s ince  i t  expects  
pul~ohases to  be put in to  basketl~), but the k i tchen  s tereotype  
wa l l  not .  However the k i tchen  s tereotype  w i l l  not be unloaded 
s ince ,  8o fa r ,  i t  has pred ic ted  88 many propos i t ions  as i t  has 
fa i led  to p red ic t .  When the th i rd  sentence  i s  read ,  aga in  the  
supermarket s te reotype  has pred ic ted  propos i t ions  of th i s  
form, but the k i tchen  s tereotype  has not .  There fore  the k i tch -  
en s tereotype  i s  removed from the  ac t ive  workspace,  and the  
top ic  of  text  i s  f i rmly  ident i f ied  a8 a v i s i t  to  the  super -  
market. 
I t  shogld benoted  that  a complete ly  rea l i s t i c  system 
would have to  perform much more complex process ing  to ana lyse  
the above example .  In  such a system add i t iona l  s te reotypes  
would probably be ac t ivated  by the  occur rence  o f  the pr imi t ive  
pat tern  fo r  food,  and i t  i s  l i ke ly  that  yet  more s tereotypes  
would be ac t ivated  by d i f fe rent  p r imi t ive  pat terns  in  the 
lex icon  ent r ies  fo r  the words in  the input  text .  
5J Conclus ions 
The techn ique  descr ibed  in  th i s  paper fo r  the ident i f i c -  
a t ion  o f  the top ic  of  a text  sec t ion  has a number of  advant -  
aKe8 over  prev ious  schemes. F i r s t ,  i t s  use of  in fo rmat ion  
which w i l l  probably  a l ready  be s to red  in  the natura l  language 
process ing  sys tem's  lex icon  has obvious advantages over  
schemes which requ i re  la rge ,  separate  data -s t ruc tures  pure ly  
fo r  top ic  ident i f i ca t ion ,  as we l l  as fo r  making the pred ic t -  
i ons  ussoo la ted  w i th  a top ic?  In  p ract i ce ,  Scrabb le  uses a 
s l ight ly  doctored  lex icon  to  improve e f f i c iency ,  but the  
necessary  work could be done by an automat ic  proprooess~Lng 
of  the lex icon .  
Second, the scheme descr ibed  here can make use o f  
nominal8 which suggest  a cand idate  top ic ,  and assoc ia ted  
s tereotypes ,  w i thout  complex ma~tpu la t ion  of  semant ic  in fo rm-  
a t ion  which I s  not  use fu l  fo r  thAs purpose.  The scheme of  
- 284  - 
(DeJong 79) ,  fo r  example, would perform complex opeZattons 
on semantic  representat ions  assoc ia ted  wi th  "p ick"  before I t  
processed the more use fu l  word " tuna"  i f  I t  processed the 
above example text .  
Third the use of semantl.o p r imi t ive  pat terns  has great -  , 
er  genera l i ty  than  techn iques  which set  up d i rec t  l inks  bet -  
ween words and bundles  of p red ic t ions ,  as appeared to  be done 
in  ear ly  vers ions  of the SAM program (Sohank 75a) .  
One f ina l  po in t .  The techn ique fo r  top ic  ident i f i ca t ion  
in  th i s  paper would not be pract i ca l  e i ther  i f  i t  was very  
expensive to load s tereotypes  which turn  out to be I r re levant ,  
or  i f  the cost of comparing the pred ic t ions  of such s tereo-  
types with the text  representat ion  was h igh.  The Scr~bble 
system, runn ing  under Cambridge LISP on an IBM 370/165 took 
8770 mi l l i seconds  to ana lyse  the example text  above of which 
756 mi l l i seconds  was used by load ing  and act ivat iDg  the two 
i r re levant  s te reotypes  and 103 mi l l i seconds  was spent  compar- 
ing  the i r  p red ic t ions  wi th  the CD-x~presentat ion f the text .  
The system des ign  i s  such that  these f igures  would not  in -  
crease dremat ica l ly  i f  more s tereotypes  were cons idered wh i l s t  
p rocess ing  the example.
