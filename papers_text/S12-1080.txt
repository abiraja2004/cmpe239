Abstract
This paper describes the participation of the
IRIT team to SemEval 2012 Task 6 (Seman-
tic Textual Similarity). The method used con-
sists of a n-gram based comparison method
combined with a conceptual similarity mea-
sure that uses WordNet to calculate the sim-
ilarity between a pair of concepts.
1 Introduction
The system used for the participation of the IRIT
team (composed by members of the research groups
SIG and MELODI) to the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity (STS) task (Agirre et al, 2012) is based on two
sub-modules:
? a module that calculates the similarity between
sentences using n-gram based similarity;
? a module that calculates the similarity between
concepts in the two sentences, using a concept
similarity measure and WordNet (Miller, 1995)
as a resource.
In Figure 1, we show the structure of the sys-
tem and the connections between the main compo-
nents. The input phrases are passed on one hand
directly to the n-gram similarity module, and on the
other they are annoted with the Stanford POS Tag-
ger (Toutanova et al, 2003). All nouns and verbs are
extracted from the tagged phrases and WordNet is
searched for synsets corresponding to the extracted
nouns and nouns associated to the verbs by the de-
rived terms relationship. The synsets are the con-
cepts used by the conceptual similarity module to

calculate the concept similarity. Each module cal-
culates a similarity score using its own method; the
final similarity value is calculated as the geometric
average between the two scores, multiplied by 5 in
order to comply with the task specifications.
The n-gram based similarity relies on the idea
that two sentences are semantically related if they
contain a long enough sub-sequence of non-empty
terms. Google Web 1T (Brants and Franz, 2006)
has been used to calculate term idf, which is used
as a measure of the importance of the terms. The
conceptual similarity is based on the idea that, given
an ontology, two concepts are semantically similar
if their distance from a common ancestor is small
enough. We used three different measures: the Wu-
Palmer similarity measure (Wu and Palmer, 1994)
and two ?Proxigenea? measures (Dudognon et al,
2010). In the following we will explain in detail how
552
each similarity module works.
2 N-Gram based Similarity
N-gram based similarity is based on the Clustered
Keywords Positional Distance (CKPD) model pro-
posed in (Buscaldi et al, 2009). This model was
originally proposed for passage retrieval in the field
of Question Answering (QA), and it has been im-
plemented in the JIRS system1. In (Buscaldi et al,
2006), JIRS showed to be able to obtain a better an-
swer coverage in the Question Answering task than
other traditional passage retrieval models based on
Vector Space Model, such as Lucene2. The model
has been adapted for this task by calculating the idf
weights for each term using the frequency value pro-
vided by Google Web 1T.
The similarity between a text fragment (or pas-
sage) p and another text fragment q is calculated as:
Sim(p, q) =
?
?x?Q
h(x, P )
1
d(x, xmax)
?n
i=1 wi
(1)
Where P is the set of n-grams with the highest
weight in p, where all terms are also contained in q;
Q is the set of all the possible j-grams in q and n
is the total number of terms in the longest passage.
The weights for each term and each n-gram are cal-
culated as:
? wi calculates the weight of the term tI as:
wi = 1?
log(ni)
1 + log(N)
(2)
Where ni is the frequency of term ti in the
Google Web 1T collection, and N is the fre-
quency of the most frequent term in the Google
Web 1T collection.
? the function h(x, P ) measures the weight of
each n-gram and is defined as:
h(x, Pj) =
{ ?j
k=1 wk if x ? Pj
0 otherwise
(3)
1http://sourceforge.net/projects/jirs/
2http://lucene.apache.org/
Where wk is the weight of the k-th term (see
Equation 2) and j is the number of terms that
compose the n-gram x;
? 1d(x,xmax) is a distance factor which reduces the
weight of the n-grams that are far from the
heaviest n-gram. The function d(x, xmax) de-
termines numerically the value of the separa-
tion according to the number of words between
a n-gram and the heaviest one. That function is
defined as show in Equation 4 :
d(x, xmax) = 1 + k? ln(1 + L) (4)
Where k is a factor that determines the impor-
tance of the distance in the similarity calcula-
tion and L is the number of words between a
n-gram and the heaviest one (see Equation 3).
In our experiments, k was set to 0.1, a default
value used in JIRS.
For instance, given the following two sentences:
?Mr. President, enlargement is essential for the con-
struction of a strong and united European continent?
and ?Mr. President, widening is essential for the
construction of a strong and plain continent of Eu-
rope?, the longest n-grams shared by the two sen-
tences are: ?Mr. President?, ?is essential for the
construction of a strong and?, ?continent?.

quency for each term in Google Web 1T unigrams set.

The weights have been calculated with Formula
2, using the frequencies from Google Web 1T. The
weights for each of the longest n-grams are 0.652,
1.809 and 0.427 respectively; their sum is 2.888
which divided by all the term weights contained
in the sentence gives 0.764 which is the similarity
score between the two sentences as calculated by the
n-gram based method.
3 Conceptual Similarity
Given Cp and Cq as the sets of concepts contained in
sentence p and q, respectively, with |Cp| ? |Cq|, the
conceptual similarity between p and q is calculated
as:
ss(p, q) =
?
c1?Cp
max
c2?Cq
s(c1, c2)
|Cp|
(5)
where s(c1, c2) is a concept similarity measure.
Concept similarity can be calculated by different
ways. Wu and Palmer introduced in (Wu and
Palmer, 1994) a concept similarity measure defined
as:
s(c1, c2) =
2 ? d(c0)
d(c1) + d(c2)
(6)
c0 is the most specific concept that is present both
in the synset path of c1 and c2 (see Figure 2 for de-
tails). The function returning the depth of a concept
is noted with d.
3.1 ProxiGenea
By making an analogy between a family tree and
the concept hierarchy in WordNet, (Dudognon et al,
2010; Ralalason, 2010) proposed a concept similar-
ity measure based on the principle of evaluating the
proximity between two members of the same fam-
ily. The measure has been named ?ProxiGenea?
(from the french Proximite? Ge?ne?alogique, genealog-
ical proximity). We took into account three versions
of the ProxiGenea measure:
pg1(c1, c2) =
d(c0)2
d(c1) ? d(c2)
(7)
This measure is very similar to the Wu-Palmer sim-
ilarity measure, but it emphasizes the distances be-
tween concepts;
pg2(c1, c2) =
d(c0)
d(c1) + d(c2)? d(c0)
(8)
In this measure, the more are the elements which are
not shared between the paths of c1 and c2, the more
the score decreases. However, if the elements are
placed more deeply in the ontology, the decrease is
less important.
pg3(c1, c2) =
1
1 + d(c1) + d(c2)? 2 ? d(c0)
(9)
In Table 2 we show the weights that have been
calculated for each concept, using all the above sim-
ilarity measures, and the concept that provided the
maximum weight. No Word Sense Disambiguation
process is carried out; therefore, the scores are cal-
culated taking into account all the possible senses
for the word. If the same concept is present in both
sentences, it obtains always a score of 1. In the other
cases, the maximum similarity value obtained with
any other concept is retained.
From the example in Table 2 we can see that Wu-
Palmer tends to give to the concepts a higher simi-
larity value than Proxigenea3.
The final score for the above example is cal-
culated as the geometric mean between the scores
obtained in Table 2 and 0.764 obtained from the
n-gram based similarity module, multiplied by 5.
Therefore, for each similarity measure, the final
scores of the example are, respectively: 4.029,
3.869, 3.921 and 3.703. The correct similarity value,
according to the gold standard, was 4.600.

4 Evaluation
Before the official runs we carried out an evalua-
tion to select the best similarity measures over the
training set provided by the organisers. The results
of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. The mea-
sure selected is the normalised Pearson correlation
(Agirre et al, 2012). We evaluated also the use of
the product instead of the geometric mean for the
combination of the two scores.

We used these results to select the final config-
urations for our participation to the STS task: we
selected to exclude Proxigenea 2 and to use the ge-
ometric mean to combine the scores of the n-gram
based similarity module and the conceptual similar-
ity module. Wu-Palmer similarity allowed to obtain
the best results on two train sets but Proxigenea 3
was the similarity measure that obtained the best av-
erage score thanks to the good result on MSRvid.
The official results obtained by our system are
shown in Table 4, with the ranking obtained for each
test set. We could observe that the system was well

behind the best system in most test sets, except for
SMTeur. This was expected since our system does
not use a machine learning approach and is com-
pletely unsupervised, while the best systems used
supervised learning. We observed also that the be-
haviour of the concept similarity measures was dif-
ferent from the behaviour on the training sets. In the
competition, the best results were always obtained
with Proxigenea3 instead of Wu-Palmer, except for
the MSRpar test set.
In Table 4 we extrapolated the results for the com-
posing methods and compared them with the result
obtained after their combination. We used the pg3
configuration for the conceptual similarity measure.
From these results, we can observe that MSRvid
was a test set where the conceptual similarity alone
would have resulted better than the combination of
scores, while SMT-news was the test set where the
CKPD measure obtained the best results in compar-
ison to the result obtained by the conceptual simi-
larity alone. It was quite surprising to observe such
a good result for a method that does not take into
account any information about the structure of the
sentences, actually viewing them as ?bags of con-

cepts?. This is probably due to the fact that SMT-
news is a corpus composed of automatically trans-
lated sentences, where structural similarity is an im-
portant clue for determining overall semantic sim-
ilarity. On the other hand, MSRvid sentences are
very short, and CKPD is in most cases unable to cap-
ture the semantic similarity.
5 Conclusions
The proposed method combined a measure of struc-
tural similarity and a measure of conceptual simi-
larity based on WordNet. With the participation to
this task, we were interested in studying the differ-
ences between different conceptual similarity mea-
sures and in determining whether they can be used
to effectively measure the semantic similarity of text
fragments. The obtained results showed that Proxi-
genea 3 allowed us to obtain the best results, indicat-
ing that under the test conditions and with WordNet
as a resource it overperforms the Wu-Palmer mea-
sure. Further studies may be required in order to
determine if these results can be generalised to other
collections and in using different ontologies. We are
also interested in comparing the method to the Lin
concept similarity measure (Lin, 1998) which takes
into account also the importance of the local root
concept.
