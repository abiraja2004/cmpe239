Abstract
Word posterior probabilities are a com-
mon approach for confidence estimation
in automatic speech recognition and ma-
chine translation. We will generalize this
idea and introduce n-gram posterior prob-
abilities and show how these can be used
to improve translation quality. Addition-
ally, we will introduce a sentence length
model based on posterior probabilities.
We will show significant improvements on
the Chinese-English NIST task. The abso-
lute improvements of the BLEU score is
between 1.1% and 1.6%.
1 Introduction
The use of word posterior probabilities is a com-
mon approach for confidence estimation in auto-
matic speech recognition, e.g. see (Wessel, 2002).
This idea has been adopted to estimate confidences
for machine translation, e.g. see (Blatz et al, 2003;
Ueffing et al, 2003; Blatz et al, 2004). These confi-
dence measures were used in the computer assisted
translation (CAT) framework, e.g. (Gandrabur and
Foster, 2003). The (simplified) idea is that the con-
fidence measure is used to decide if the machine-
generated prediction should be suggested to the hu-
man translator or not.
There is only few work on how to improve
machine translation performance using confidence
measures. The only work, we are aware of, is
(Blatz et al, 2003). The outcome was that the con-
fidence measures did not result in improvements of
the translation quality measured with the BLEU and
NIST scores. Here, we focus on how the ideas and
methods commonly used for confidence estimation
can be adapted and/or extended to improve transla-
tion quality.
So far, always word-level posterior probabilities
were used. Here, we will generalize this idea to n-
grams.
In addition to the n-gram posterior probabili-
ties, we introduce a sentence-length model based
on posterior probabilities. The common phrase-
based translation systems, such as (Och et al, 1999;
Koehn, 2004), do not use an explicit sentence length
model. Only the simple word penalty goes into that
direction. It can be adjusted to prefer longer or
shorter translations. Here, we will explicitly model
the sentence length.
The novel contributions of this work are to in-
troduce n-gram posterior probabilities and sentence
length posterior probabilities. Using these methods,
we achieve significant improvements of translation
quality.
The remaining part of this paper is structured as
follows: first, we will briefly describe the baseline
system, which is a state-of-the-art phrase-based sta-
tistical machine translation system. Then, in Sec-
tion 3, we will introduce the n-gram posterior prob-
abilities. In Section 4, we will define the sentence
length model. Afterwards, in Section 5, we will
describe how these novel models can be used for
rescoring/reranking. The experimental results will
be presented in Section 6. Future applications will
be described in Section 7. Finally, we will conclude
in Section 8.

2 Baseline System
In statistical machine translation, we are given a
source language sentence fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ ,
which is to be translated into a target language sen-
tence eI1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Among all possible tar-
get language sentences, we will choose the sentence
with the highest probability:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1|fJ1 )
} (1)
The posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) is modeled di-
rectly using a log-linear combination of several
models (Och and Ney, 2002):
Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) =
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
)
?
I?,e?I?1
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(e?I
?
1 , fJ1 )
)
(2)
The denominator is a normalization factor that de-
pends only on the source sentence fJ1 . Therefore,
we can omit it during the search process. As a deci-
sion rule, we obtain:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{ M
?
m=1
?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
}
(3)
This approach is a generalization of the source-
channel approach (Brown et al, 1990). It has the
advantage that additional models h(?) can be eas-
ily integrated into the overall system. The model
scaling factors ?M1 are trained with respect to the fi-
nal translation quality measured by an error criterion
(Och, 2003).
We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation
system as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004; Zens
et al, 2005). The baseline system includes the fol-
lowing models: an n-gram language model, a phrase
translation model and a word-based lexicon model.
The latter two models are used for both directions:
p(f |e) and p(e|f). Additionally, we use a word
penalty and a phrase penalty.
3 N-Gram Posterior Probabilities
The idea is similar to the word posterior probabili-
ties: we sum the sentence posterior probabilities for
each occurrence of an n-gram.
Let ?(?, ?) denote the Kronecker function. Then,
we define the fractional count C(en1 , fJ1 ) of an n-
gram en1 for a source sentence fJ1 as:
C(en1 , fJ1 ) =
?
I,e?I1
I?n+1
?
i=1
p(e?I1|fJ1 ) ? ?(e?
i+n?1
i , en1 )
(4)
The sums over the target language sentences are lim-
ited to an N -best list, i.e. the N best translation
candidates according to the baseline model. In this
equation, the term ?(e?i+n?1i , en1 ) is one if and only
if the n-gram en1 occurs in the target sentence e?
I
1
starting at position i.
Then, the posterior probability of an n-gram is ob-
tained as:
p(en1 |fJ1 ) =
C(en1 , fJ1 )
?
e?n1
C(e?n1 , fJ1 )
(5)
Note that the widely used word posterior proba-
bility is obtained as a special case, namely if n is set
to one.
4 Sentence Length Posterior Probability
The common phrase-based translation systems, such
as (Och et al, 1999; Koehn, 2004), do not use an ex-
plicit sentence length model. Only the simple word
penalty goes into that direction. It can be adjusted to
prefer longer or shorter translations.
Here, we will use the posterior probability of a
specific target sentence length I as length model:
p(I|fJ1 ) =
?
eI1
p(eI1|fJ1 ) (6)
Note that the sum is carried out only over target sen-
tences eI1 with the a specific length I . Again, the
candidate target language sentences are limited to an
N -best list.
5 Rescoring/Reranking
A straightforward application of the posterior prob-
abilities is to use them as additional features in
a rescoring/reranking approach (Och et al, 2004).
The use of N -best lists in machine translation has
several advantages. It alleviates the effects of the
huge search space which is represented in word
73
graphs by using a compact excerpt of the N best hy-
potheses generated by the system. N -best lists are
suitable for easily applying several rescoring tech-
niques since the hypotheses are already fully gen-
erated. In comparison, word graph rescoring tech-
niques need specialized tools which can traverse the
graph accordingly.
The n-gram posterior probabilities can be used
similar to an n-gram language model:
hn(fJ1 , eI1) =
1
I log
( I
?
i=1
p(ei|ei?1i?n+1, fJ1 )
)
(7)
with:
p(ei|ei?1i?n+1, fJ1 ) =
C(eii?n+1, fJ1 )
C(ei?1i?n+1, fJ1 )
(8)
Note that the models do not require smoothing as
long as they are applied to the same N -best list they
are trained on.
If the models are used for unseen sentences,
smoothing is important to avoid zero probabilities.
We use a linear interpolation with weights ?n and
the smoothed (n ? 1)-gram model as generalized
distribution.
pn(ei|ei?1i?n+1, fJ1 ) = ?n ?
C(eii?n+1, fJ1 )
C(ei?1i?n+1, fJ1 )
(9)
+(1 ? ?n) ? pn?1(ei|ei?1i?n+2, fJ1 )
Note that absolute discounting techniques that are
often used in language modeling cannot be applied
in a straightforward way, because here we have frac-
tional counts.
The usage of the sentence length posterior prob-
ability for rescoring is even simpler. The resulting
feature is:
hL(fJ1 , eI1) = log p(I|fJ1 ) (10)
Again, the model does not require smoothing as long
as it is applied to the same N -best list it is trained
on. If it is applied to other sentences, smoothing
becomes important. We propose to smooth the sen-
tence length model with a Poisson distribution.
p?(I|fJ1 ) = ??p(I|fJ1 )+(1??)?
?I exp(??)
I! (11)
We use a linear interpolation with weight ?. The
mean ? of the Poisson distribution is chosen to
be identical to the mean of the unsmoothed length
model:
? =
?
I
I ? p(I|fJ1 ) (12)
6 Experimental Results
6.1 Corpus Statistics
The experiments were carried out on the large data
track of the Chinese-English NIST task. The cor-
pus statistics of the bilingual training corpus are
shown in Table 1. The language model was trained
on the English part of the bilingual training cor-
pus and additional monolingual English data from
the GigaWord corpus. The total amount of lan-
guage model training data was about 600M running
words. We use a fourgram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing as implemented in
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
To measure the translation quality, we use the
BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) and the NIST
score (Doddington, 2002). The BLEU score is the
geometric mean of the n-gram precision in com-
bination with a brevity penalty for too short sen-
tences. The NIST score is the arithmetic mean of
a weighted n-gram precision in combination with a
brevity penalty for too short sentences. Both scores
are computed case-sensitive with respect to four ref-
erence translations using the mteval-v11b tool1. As
the BLEU and NIST scores measure accuracy higher
scores are better.
We use the BLEU score as primary criterion
which is optimized on the development set using the
Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press et al, 2002). As
development set, we use the NIST 2002 evaluation
set. Note that the baseline system is already well-
tuned and would have obtained a high rank in the
last NIST evaluation (NIST, 2005).
6.2 Translation Results
The translation results for the Chinese-English NIST
task are presented in Table 2. We carried out experi-
ments for evaluation sets of several years. For these
rescoring experiments, we use the 10 000 best trans-
lation candidates, i.e. N -best lists of size N=10 000.

Using the 1-gram posterior probabilities, i.e. the
conventional word posterior probabilities, there is
only a very small improvement, or no improvement
at all. This is consistent with the findings of the
JHU workshop on confidence estimation for statis-
tical machine translation 2003 (Blatz et al, 2003),
where the word-level confidence measures also did
not help to improve the BLEU or NIST scores.
Successively adding higher order n-gram poste-
rior probabilities, the translation quality improves
consistently across all evaluation sets. We also
performed experiments with n-gram orders beyond
four, but these did not result in further improve-
ments.
Adding the sentence length posterior probability
feature is also helpful for all evaluation sets. For the
development set, the overall improvement is 1.5%
for the BLEU score. On the blind evaluation sets,
the overall improvement of the translation quality
ranges between 1.1% and 1.6% BLEU.
Some translation examples are shown in Table 3.
7 Future Applications
We have shown that the n-gram posterior probabil-
ities are very useful in a rescoring/reranking frame-
work. In addition, there are several other potential
applications. In this section, we will describe two of
them.
7.1 Iterative Search
The n-gram posterior probability can be used for
rescoring as described in Section 5. An alternative is
to use them directly during the search. In this second
search pass, we use the models from the first pass,
i.e. the baseline system, and additionally the n-gram
and sentence length posterior probabilities. As the
n-gram posterior probabilities are basically a kind
of sentence-specific language model, it is straight-
forward to integrate them. This process can also be
iterated. Thus, using the N -best list of the second
pass to recompute the n-gram and sentence length
posterior probabilities and do a third search pass,
etc..
7.2 Computer Assisted Translation
In the computer assisted translation (CAT) frame-
work, the goal is to improve the productivity of hu-
man translators. The machine translation system
takes not only the current source language sentence
but also the already typed partial translation into ac-
count. Based on this information, the system suggest
completions of the sentence. Word-level posterior
probabilities have been used to select the most ap-
propriate completion of the system, for more details
see e.g. (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing and
Ney, 2005). The n-gram based posterior probabili-
ties as described in this work, might be better suited
for this task as they explicitly model the dependency
on the previous words, i.e. the given prefix.
8 Conclusions
We introduced n-gram and sentence length poste-
rior probabilities and demonstrated their usefulness
for rescoring purposes. We performed systematic
experiments on the Chinese-English NIST task and
showed significant improvements of the translation
quality. The improvements were consistent among
several evaluation sets.
An interesting property of the introduced meth-
ods is that they do not require additional knowledge
sources. Thus the given knowledge sources are bet-
ter exploited. Our intuition is that the posterior mod-
els prefer hypotheses with n-grams that are common
in the N -best list.
The achieved results are promising. Despite that,
there are several ways to improve the approach.

Reference During the unrest that lasted more than three months, a total of more than 60 people died
and over 2,000 were wounded.
For the decision rule in Equation 3, the model
scaling factors ?M1 can be multiplied with a constant
factor without changing the result. This global fac-
tor would affect the proposed posterior probabilities.
So far, we have not tuned this parameter, but a proper
adjustment might result in further improvements.
Currently, the posterior probabilities are com-
puted on an N -best list. Using word graphs instead
should result in more reliable estimates, as the num-
ber of hypotheses in a word graph is some orders of
a magnitude larger than in an N -best list.
