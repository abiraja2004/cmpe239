Abstract 
We report in this paper a novel hybrid ap-
proach for Urdu to Hindi transliteration that 
combines finite-state machine (FSM) based 
techniques with statistical word language 
model based approach. The output from the 
FSM is filtered with the word language model 
to produce the correct Hindi output. The main 
problem handled is the case of omission of di-
acritical marks from the input Urdu text. Our 
system produces the correct Hindi output even 
when the crucial information in the form of di-
acritic marks is absent. The approach improves 
the accuracy of the transducer-only approach 
from 50.7% to 79.1%. The results reported 
show that performance can be improved using 
a word language model to disambiguate the 
output produced by the transducer-only ap-
proach, especially when diacritic marks are not 
present in the Urdu input. 
1 Introduction 
Transliteration is a process to transcribe a word 
written in one language, in another language by 
preserving its articulation. It is crucial for han-
dling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in differ-
ent domains of Natural Language Processing 
(NLP), especially in Machine Translation 
(Knight and Graehl, 1998; Knight and Stall, 
1998; Paola and Sanjeev, 2003), Cross-Lingual 
Information Retrieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), the 
development of multi-lingual resources (Yan et 
al., 2003) and multi-lingual text and speech 
processing. It is also useful for Inter-dialectal 
translation without lexical changes and some-
times it is mandatory when the dialects in ques-
tion use mutually incomprehensible writing sys-
tems. Such cases exists in Malay (written in 2 
different scripts), Turkish (2 scripts), Kurdish (3 
scripts), Hindi/Urdu (2 scripts), Punjabi (2 
scripts), etc., where words are transliterated from 
one script to the other, irrespective of their type 
(noun, verb, etc., and not only proper nouns and 
unknown words). In this study, we will focus on 
Hindi/Urdu example. 
Hindi and Urdu are written in two mutually 
incomprehensible scripts, Devanagari and Urdu 
script ? a derivative of Persio-Arabic script re-
spectively. Hindi and Urdu are the official lan-
guages of India and the later is also the National 
language of Pakistan (Rahman, 2004). Table 1 
gives an idea about the number of speakers of 
Hindi and Urdu.

Table 1: Hindi and Urdu Speakers 
Notwithstanding the transcriptional differences, 
Hindi and Urdu share phonology, grammar, 
morphology, literature, cultural heritage, etc. 
People from Hindi and Urdu communities can 
understand the verbal expressions of each other 
but the written expression of one community is 
alien to the other community. 
A finite-state transliteration model for Hindi 
and Urdu transliteration using the Universal In-
termediate Transcription (UIT ? a pivot between 
the two scripts) was proposed by Malik et al 
(2008). The non-probabilistic finite-state model 
is not powerful enough to solve all problems of 
Hindi ? Urdu transliteration. We visit and ana-
lyze Hindi ? Urdu transliteration problems in 
the next section and show that the solution of 
these problems is beyond the scope of a non-
probabilistic finite-state transliteration model. 
177
Following this, we show how a statistical model 
can be used to solve some of these problems, 
thereby enhancing the capabilities of the finite-
state model. 
Thus, we propose a hybrid transliteration 
model by combining the finite-state model and 
the statistical word language model for solving 
Hindi ? Urdu transliteration problems, dis-
cussed in section 2. Section 3 will throw light on 
the proposed model, its different components and 
various steps involved in its construction. In sec-
tion 4, we will report and various aspects of dif-
ferent experiments and their results. Finally, we 
will conclude this study in section 5. 
2 Hindi Urdu Transliteration 
In this section, we will analyze Hindi ? Urdu 
transliteration problems and will concentrate on 
Urdu to Hindi transliteration only due to shortage 
of space and will discuss the reverse translitera-
tion later. Thus, the remainder of the section ana-
lyzes the problems from Urdu to Hindi translite-
ration. 
2.1 Vowel, Yeh (?) and Waw (?) 
Urdu is written in a derivation of Persio-Arabic 
script. Urdu vowels are represented with the help 
of four long vowels Alef-madda (?), Alef (?), 
Waw (?), Yeh (?) and diacritical marks. One 
vowel can be represented in many ways depend-
ing upon its context or on the origin of the word, 
e.g. the vowel [?] is represented by Alef-madda 
(?) at the beginning of a word, by Alef (?) in the 
middle of a word and in some Persio-Arabic loan 
word, it is represented by the diacritical mark 
Khari Zabar (G?). Thus Urdu has very complex 
vowel system, for more details see Malik et al 
(2008). Urdu contains 10 vowels, and 7 of them 
also have their nasalization forms (Hussain, 
2004; Khan, 1997) and 15 diacritical marks. 
Thou diacritical marks form the cornerstone of 
the Urdu vowel system, but are sparingly used 
(Zia, 1999). They are vital for the correct Urdu to 
Hindi transliteration using the finite-state transli-
teration model. The accuracy of the finite-state 
transliteration model decreases from above 80% 
to 50% in the absence of diacritical marks. Fig-
ure 1 shows two example Urdu phrases (i) with 
and (ii) without the diacritical marks and their 
Hindi transliteration using the finite-state transli-
teration model. Due to the absence of Zabar (F?) 
in the first and the last words in (1)(ii) and in the 
5th word in (2)(ii), vowels ? ? [?] and ? [?] are 
transliterated into vowels ?? [e] and ? [o] re-
spectively. Similarly, due to the absence of Pesh 
( E?) and Zer (G?) in 3rd and 4th words respectively 
in (1)(ii), both vowels ? ? [?] and ?? [?] are con-
verted into the vowel [?]. All wrongly converted 
words are underlined. 
 
(1)  (i) ??? ???? ?? ???? ????? ??? ????? ???? 
 (ii) ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? 
(i) ??? ?? ???? ???? ??? ???? ???? ?? 
?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? (ii) 
I have not done a lot of work 
(2) (i) ????? ?? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ???????????  
  (ii) ????? ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ???  
(i) ??????? ??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?? 
?? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? (ii) 
Both at the central level and at the state level 
Figure 1: Example Urdu Phrases 
In Hindi, each vowel is represented by a cha-
racter and a vowel sign except the vowel [?], 
which is only represented by the character ? and 
do not have a vowel sign (Malik et al, 2008). 
Table 2 gives all vowel conversion problems.

Table 2: Vowel Problems from Urdu to Hindi 
Long vowels Yeh (?) [j] and Waw (?) [v] are 
also used as consonants and certain contextual 
rules help us to decide whether they are used as a 
consonant or as a vowel, e.g., Yeh (?) and Waw 
(?) are used as consonants at the start of a word 
and after the long vowel Alef-madda (?), etc. Fi-
178
nite-state transliteration model can exploit such 
contextual rules but it is not possible to decide 
Yeh (?) and Waw (?) as consonants in the ab-
sence of diacritics. Thus a finite-state translitera-
tion model wrongly converts consonant Yeh (?) 
and Waw (?) into vowels ?? [e] and ?? [o], also 
given in Table 2, instead of consonants Ya (?) 
and Wa (?) respectively, e.g., in the word ????? 
(prince) [k??vr], Waw is wrongly converted into 
the vowel [o] due to the absence of Zabar ( F?) 
after it and the word becomes [k?nor], which is 
not a valid word of Hindi/Urdu. 
2.2 Native Sounds 
The Hindi writing system contains some native 
sounds/characters, e.g., vocalic R (?) [r?], retrof-
lex form of Na (?) [?], etc. On the other hand 
Urdu does not have their equivalents. Thus 
words containing such sounds are transcribed in 
Urdu with their approximate phonetic equiva-
lents. All such cases are problematic for Urdu to 
Hindi transliteration and are given in Table 3. 
 
Sr. IPA Hindi Urdu 
1 r? ? or ?? ? [r] 
2 ? ? ? [n] 
3 ? ? ? [?] 
4 Half h ?? ? [h] 
Table 3: Sounds of Sanskrit Origin 
2.3 Conjunct Form 
The Hindi alphabet is partly syllabic because 
each consonant inherits the vowel [?]. Two or 
more consonants may be combined together to 
form a cluster called Conjunct that marks the 
absence of the inherited vowel [?] between con-
sonants (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut, 2004). Con-
junction is also used to represent the gemination 
of a consonant, e.g., ?[k]+??+?[k]=???[kk] 
where ?? is the conjunct marker and aspiration of 
some consonants like ? [n], ? [m], ? [r] and ? 
[l] when used as conjunction with ? [h], e.g., 
?[n] + ?? + ?[h] = ???[nh]. Conjunction has a spe-
cial meaning but native speakers use conjunct 
forms without any explicit rule (Montaut, 2004). 
On the other hand, Urdu uses Jazam ( H? ? a 
diacritic) and Shadda (H?) to mark the absence of 
a vowel between two consonants and gemination 
of a consonant respectively. In the absence of 
these diacritics in the input Urdu text, it is not 
possible to decide on the conjunct form of con-
sonants except in the case of aspiration. In Urdu, 
aspiration of a consonant is marked with the spe-
cial character Heh-Doachashmee (?) (Malik et 
al., 2008), thus a finite-state transducer can easi-
ly decide about the conjunction for aspiration 
with a simple contextual rule, e.g. the word ????? 
(bride) [d??lhn] is correctly transliterated by our 
finite-state transliteration model into ??????. 
2.4 Native Hindi Spellings and Sanskritized 
Vocabulary 
Sanskrit highly influences Hindi and especially 
its vocabulary. In some words of Sanskrit origin, 
the vowel ?? [i] and ?? [u] are transcribed as ?? 
[?] and ?? [?] respectively at the end of a word. 
Javaid and Ahmed (2009) have pointed to this 
issue in these words ?Hindi language can have 
words that end on short vowel??. Table 4 gives 
some examples of such native words. On the 
other hand in Urdu, short vowels can never come 
at the end of a word (Javaid and Ahmed, 2009; 
Malik et al, 2008). 
 
Vowel Examples 
?? [i] 
??????? ? ????? (person) [vj?kti] 
??????? ? ??????? (culture) [s??skr?t?i] 
???????? ? ??????? (high) [???ko?i] 
?? [u] 
???? ? ????? (for) [het?u] 
????? ?? ????? (but) [k?nt?u] 
???? ? ?????? (metal) [d??t?u] 
Table 4: Hindi Word with Short vowel at End 
It is clear from above examples that short vowels 
at the end of a Hindi word can easily be translite-
rated in Urdu using a contextual rule of a finite-
state transducer, but it is not possible to do so for 
Urdu to Hindi transliteration using a non-
probabilistic finite-state transliteration model. 
Thus Urdu to Hindi transliteration can also be 
179
considered as a special case of Back Translitera-
tion. 
In some words, the vowel ?? [u] is written as 
the vowel ?? [?], e.g., ??? ? ????? or ??? ? ???? (to be) 
[hue], ??????? (name of a city) [r???npur]. 
Some of these cases are regular and can be im-
plemented as contextual rules in a finite-state 
transducer but it is not possible in every case. 
2.5 Ain (?) 
Ain (? ? glottal stop) exists in the Arabic alpha-
bet and native Arabic speakers pronounce it 
properly. Urdu also has adopted Ain (?) in its 
alphabet as well as Arabic loan words but native 
speakers of the sub-continent cannot produce its 
sound properly, rather they produce a vowel 
sound by replacing Ain (?) with Alef (?). The 
Hindi alphabet follows one character for one 
sound rule and it does not have any equivalent of 
Ain (?). Then, Ain (?) in Urdu words is tran-
scribed in Hindi by some vowel representing the 
pronunciation of the word by native sub-
continent speakers. Thus it is always translite-
rated in some vowel in Hindi. For example, Ain 
(?) gives the sound of the vowel [?] in ????  ? 
???? (strange) [??ib] and the vowel [?] with 
and without Alef (?) in words ???  ? ?? (com-
mon) [?m] and ???  ? ??? (after) [b?d?] respective-
ly. In some words, Ain (?) is not pronounced at 
all and should be deleted while transliterating 
from Urdu to Hindi, e.g., ??????  ? ???? (to start) 
[??ru], etc. Conversion of Ain (?) is a big prob-
lem for transliteration. 
2.6 Nasalization 
Noonghunna (?) [?] is the nasalization marker of 
vowels in Urdu. Interestingly, it is only used to 
nasalize a vowel at the end of a word. In the 
middle of a word, Noon (?) [n] is used to mark 
the nasalization of a vowel and it is also used as 
a consonant. It is difficult to differentiate be-
tween nasalized and consonant Noon (?). There 
are certain contextual rules that help to decide 
that Noon (?) is used as a consonant or a nasali-
zation marker, but it not possible in all cases. 
2.7 Persio-Arabic Vocabulary 
Urdu borrows a considerable portion of it voca-
bulary from Persian and Arabic and translitera-
tion of these words in Hindi is not regular. Table 
5 explains it with few examples.

3 Hybrid Transliteration Model 
The analysis of the previous section clearly 
shows that solution of these problems is beyond 
the scope of the non-probabilistic Hindi Urdu 
Finite-state transliteration model (Malik et al, 
2008). We propose a hybrid transliteration model 
that takes the input Urdu text and converts it in 
Hindi using the Finite-state Transliteration Mod-
el (Malik et al 2008). After that, it tries to cor-
rect the orthographic errors in the transducer-
only Hindi output string using a statistical word 
language model for Hindi with the help of a 
Hindi Word Map described later. The approach 
used is rather similar to what is done in text re-
capitalization (Stolcke et al 1998) for instance. 
 
Figure 2: Hybrid Transliteration Model for Urdu 
Hindi 
Normally, the Urdu text does not contain neces-
sary diacritical marks that are mandatory for the 
correct transliteration by the finite-state compo-
nent Urdu Hindi Transliteration 
180
Finite-state Machine (UHT-FSM), 
described by Malik et al (2008). The proposed 
hybrid model focuses on the correct translitera-
tion of Urdu texts without diacritical marks. Fig-
ure 2 gives the proposed Model architecture. 
3.1 Preprocessing UHT-FSM Output 
The goal of this pre-processing is to generate a 
more ?normalized? (and consequently more am-
biguous) form of Hindi, e.g. pre-processing 
transforms both corpus words ?? (this) [?s] and 
?? (that) [?s] (if encountered in the UHT-FSM 
Hindi output) into the default input Hindi word 
??* [?s] (not a valid Hindi word but is a finite-
state transliteration of the input Urdu word ??, a 
word without diacritical marks). Thus pre-
processing is vital for establishing connections 
between the UHT-FSM Hindi output words 
(from the Urdu input without diacritical marks) 
and the Hindi corpus words. In the example 
above, the word ??* [?s] is aligned to two Hin-
di corpus words. All such alignments are record-
ed in the Hindi Word Map. This ambiguity will 
be solved by the Hindi word language 
model, trained on a large amount of Hindi data. 
Thus pre-processing is a process that establishes 
connections between the most likely expected 
input Hindi word forms (UHT-FSM Hindi output 
from the Urdu input without diacritical marks) 
and the correct Hindi word forms (words that are 
present in the Hindi corpus). 
The Preprocessing component is a finite-
state transducer that normalizes the Hindi output 
of UHT-FSM component for the Hindi word 
language model. The transducer converts all 
cases of gemination of consonants into a simple 
consonant. For example, the UHT-FSM converts 
the Urdu word ??? (God) [r?bb] into ???? and the 
Preprocessing converts it into ?? [rb]. The 
transducer also removes the conjunct marker (??) 
from the output of the UHT-FSM except when it 
is preceded by one of the consonant from the set 
{? [r], ? [l], ? [m], ? [n]} and also followed by 
the consonant ? [h] (first 3 lines of Figure 3), 
e.g., UHT-FSM converts the Urdu words ?????? 
(Hindi) [h?ndi] and ????? (bride) [d??lhn] into ?????? 
and ?????? respectively and the Preprocess-
ing component converts them into ????? (re-
moves ??) and ?????? (no change). Actually, Pre-
processing deteriorates the accuracy of the output 
of the UHT-FSM component. We will come back 
to this point with exact figures in the next sec-
tion. 
The code of the finite-state transducer is given 
in XFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) style in 
Figure 3. In XFST, the rules are applied in re-
verse order due to XFST?s transducer stack, i.e. a 
rule written at the end of the XFST script file 
will apply first and so on.

3.2 Hindi Word Language Model 
The Hindi Word Language Model is an 
important component of the hybrid transliteration 
model. For the development of our statistical 
word language model, we have used the Hindi 
Corpus freely available from the Center for In-
dian Language Technology1, Indian Institute of 
Technology Bombay (IITB), India. 
First, we extracted all Hindi sentences from 
the Hindi corpus. Then we removed all punctua-
tion marks from each sentence. Finally, we add-
ed ?<s>? and ?</s>? tags at the start and at the 
end of each sentence. We trained a tri-gram 
Hindi Word Language Model with the 
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) tool. The processed Hin-
di corpus data contains total 173,087 unique sen-

181
tences and more than 3.5 million words. The 
SRILM toolkit command ?disambig? is used to 
generate the final Hindi output using the statis-
tical word language model for Hindi and the 
Hindi Word Map described in the next section.  
3.3 Hindi Word Map 
The Hindi Word Map is another very important 
component of the proposed hybrid transliteration 
model. It describes how each ?normalized? Hindi 
word that can be seen after the Preprocess-
ing step and can be converted to one or several 
correct Hindi words, the final decision being 
made by the statistical word language model for 
Hindi. We have developed it from the same 
processed Hindi corpus data that was used to 
build the Hindi Word Language Model. 
We extracted all unique Hindi words (120,538 
unique words in total). 
The hybrid transliteration model is an effort to 
correctly transliterate the input Urdu text without 
diacritical marks in Hindi. Thus we take each 
unique Hindi word and try to generate all possi-
ble Hindi word options that can be given as input 
to the Hindi Word Language Model 
component for the said word. Consider the Urdu 
word ??? (God) [r?bb]; its correct Hindi spel-
lings are ????. If we remove the diacritical mark 
Shadda (H?) after the last character of the word, 
then the word becomes ?? and UHT-FSM trans-
literates it in ??*. Thus the Hindi Word 
Language Model will encounter either ???? or 
??* for the Hindi word ???? (two possible word 
options). In other words, the Hindi Word Map is 
a computational model that records all possible 
alignments between the ?normalized? or pre-
processed words (most likely input word forms) 
and the correct Hindi words from the corpus. 
We have applied a finite-state transducer that 
generates all possible word options for each 
unique Hindi word. We cannot give the full 
XFST code of the ?Default Input Creator? due to 
space shortage, but a sample XFST code is given 
in Figure 4. If the Urdu input contains all neces-
sary diacritical marks, then pre-processing of the 
output of the UHT-FSM tries to remove the effect 
of some of these diacritical marks from the Hindi 
output. In the next section, we will show that 
actually it increases the accuracy at the end.

Figure 4: Default Input Creator Transducer 
Practically, the Hindi Word Map is a file in 
which each line contains a possible input word to 
Hindi Word Language Model, followed 
by a list of one (see line 3 of Figure 5) or more 
(see line 1 of Figure 5) words from the corpus 
that are associated with this possible input word. 
The ?Default Input Creator? transducer has 
generated in total 961,802 possible input words 
for 120,538 unique Hindi words. For implemen-
tation reasons, we also added non-ambiguous 
pair entries in the word map (see line 2 of Figure 
5), thus the initial word map contains in total 
1,082,340 entries. We extract unique option 
words and finally, Hindi Word Map contains in 
total 962,893 entries. Some examples from Hindi 
Word Map file are given in Table 5.

4 Test and Results 
For testing purposes, we extracted 200 Hindi 
sentences from the Hindi corpus before removing 
punctuation marks. These sentences were of 
course removed from the training corpus used to 
build the statistical word language model for 
Hindi. First we converted these 200 Hindi sen-
tences in Urdu using Hindi Urdu Finite-state 
transliteration model (Malik et al, 2008). Trans-
182
literated Urdu sentences were post edited ma-
nually for any error and we also made sure that 
the Urdu text contained all diacritical marks. 200 
original Hindi sentences served as Hindi refer-
ence for evaluation purposes. 
From the post-edited Urdu sentences, we de-
veloped two test corpora. The first test corpus 
was the Urdu test with all diacritical marks. In 
the second test corpus, all diacritical marks were 
removed. We calculated both word level and 
character level accuracy and error rates using the 
SCLITE 2  tool. Our 200 sentence test contains 
4,250 words and 16,677 characters in total. 
4.1 Test: UHT-FSM 
First we converted both Urdu test data using 
UHT-FSM only and compared the transliterated 
Hindi texts with the Hindi reference. UHT-FSM 
shows a word error rate of 21.5% and 51.5% for 
the Urdu test data with and without diacritics 
respectively. Results are given in Table 6, row 1.

Table 6: Word Level Results 
These results support our claims that the absence 
of diacritical marks considerably increases the 
error rate. 
4.2 Test: UHT-FSM + Hindi Language 
Model 
Both outputs of UHT-FSM are first passed direct-
ly to Hindi Word Language Model with-
out preprocessing. The Hindi Word Lan-
guage Model converts UHT-FSM Hindi out-
put in the final Hindi output with the help of 
Hindi Word Map. 
Two final outputs were again compared with 
the Hindi reference and results are given in Table 
6, row 2. For Urdu test data without diacritics, 
error rate decreased by 28.4% due to the Hindi 
Word Language Model and Hindi Word

Map as compared to the UHT-FSM error rate. 
The Hindi Word Language Model also decreases 
the error rate by 1.9% for the Urdu test data with 
diacritics. 
4.3 Test: UHT-FSM + Preprocessing 
In this test, both outputs of UHT-FSM were pre-
processed and the intermediate Hindi outputs 
were compared with the Hindi reference. Results 
are given in Table 6, row 3. After the comparison 
of results of row 1 and row 3, it is clear that pre-
processing deteriorates the accuracy of Urdu test 
data with diacritics and does not have any effect 
on Urdu test data without diacritics. 
4.4 Test: UHT-FSM + Preprocessing + 
Hindi Language Model 
Preprocessed UHT-FSM Hindi outputs of the test 
of Section 4.3 were passed to the Hindi Word 
Language Model that produced final Hindi 
outputs with the help of the Hindi Word Map. 
Results are given in Table 6, row 4. They show 
that the Hindi Word Language Model 
increases the accuracy by 5.1% and 18.3% when 
compared with the accuracy of UHT-FSM and 
UHT-FSM + Preprocessing tests respectively, for 
the Urdu test data with diacritical marks. 
For the Urdu test data without diacritical 
marks, the Hindi Word Language Model 
increases the accuracy rate by 28.3% in compari-
son to the accuracy of the UHT-FSM output 
(whether pre-processed or not). 
4.5 Character Level Results 
All outputs of tests of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 
4.4 and the Hindi reference are processed to cal-
culate the character level accuracy and error 
rates. Results are given in Table 7.

4.6 Results and Examples 
The Hindi Word Language Model in-
creases the accuracy of Urdu Hindi translitera-
tion, especially for the Urdu input without dia-
critical marks. 
Consider the examples of Figure 7. Figure 1 is 
reproduced here by adding the Hindi translitera-
tion of example sentences using the proposed 
hybrid transliteration model and Hindi reference.

Figure 7: Examples 
By comparing Hindi outputs of Hindi Word 
Language Model with the Hindi reference, 
only the first word of (2)(ii) is wrong and other 
errors due to the absence of diacritical marks in 
the source Urdu sentences are corrected properly. 
5 Conclusion 
From the test results of the previous section we 
can conclude that the statistical word language 
model increases the accuracy of Urdu to Hindi 
transliteration, especially for Urdu input text 
without diacritical marks. The proposed Hybrid 
Transliteration Model improves the accuracy and 
produces the correct Hindi output even when the 
crucial information in the form of diacritical 
marks is absent. It increases the accuracy by 
28.3% in comparison to our previous Finite-state 
Transliteration Model. This study also shows that 
diacritical marks are crucial and necessary for 
Hindi Urdu transliteration.
