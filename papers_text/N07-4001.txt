Introduction
We describe a system that can learn new 
procedure models effectively from one 
demonstration by the user. Previous work to learn 
tasks through observing a demonstration (e.g., 
Lent & Laird, 2001) has required observing many 
examples of the same task. One-shot learning of 
tasks presents a significant challenge because the 
observed sequence is inherently incomplete ? the 
user only performs the steps required for the 
current situation.  Furthermore, their decision-
making processes, which reflect the control 
structures in the procedure, are not revealed. 
We will demonstrate a system called PLOW 
(Procedural Learning on the Web) that learns task 
knowledge through observation accompanied by a 
natural language ?play-by-play?. Natural 
language (NL) alleviates many task learning 
problems by identifying (i) a useful level of 
abstraction of observed actions; (ii) parameter 
dependencies; (iii) hierarchical structure; (iv) 
semantic relationships between the task and the 
items involved in the actions; and (v) control 
constructs not otherwise observable. Various 
specialized reasoning modules in the system 
communicate and collaborate with each other to 
interpret the user?s intentions, build a task model 
based on the interpretation, and check consistency 
between the learned task and prior knowledge.
The play-by-play approach in NL enables our 
task learning system to build a task with high-
level constructs that are not inferable from 
observed actions alone. In addition to the 
knowledge about task structure, NL also provides 
critical information to transform the observed 
actions into more robust and reliable executable 
forms. Our system learns how to find objects used 
in the task, unifying the linguistic information of 
the objects with the semantic representations of 
the user?s NL descriptions about them.  The 
objects can then be reliably found in dynamic and 
complex environments. See Jung et al(2006) and 
Chambers et al(2006) for more details on the 
PLOW system.
The PLOW System
PLOW learns tasks executable on the web 
involving actions such as navigation, information 
extraction and form filling, and can learn iterative 
steps that operate over lists of objects on pages. 
Figure 1 shows the system during learning a task 
to find publications for a specified author. Upper 
left is the Mozilla browser, in which the user can 
demonstrate action and the system can execute 
actions in a mixed-initiative fashion. The user 
may speak or type to the system (SR output is 
lower right), and PLOW combines knowledge 
from the language and the demonstrated actions to 
produce a parameterized procedure (described in 
generated natural language in the upper right 
corner). Figure 2 shows a complete training 
dialogue in which PLOW learns how to find 
article titles. To save space, simple 
acknowledgments by the system are not shown.

Evaluation
The PLOW system was evaluated by independent 
evaluators who considered four task learning 
systems developed in the CALO project. There 
were 16 human subjects who received training on 
each of the systems and who worked through a 
number of successful scripted training sessions 
with each. They were then given ten new 
problems, ranging from slight variations to 
problems they had seen to problems that were 
substantially new. They were free to choose which 
problems to work on and which system to use and 
the resulting tasks learned were tested with 
different settings of the parameters and scored out 
of a total of 4 points based on a complex 
predefined evaluation criteria (not known to the 
developers). The PLOW system did well in the 
test, not only receiving the highest average score 
on tasks learned by a system (figure 3) but also 
was strongly preferred by the users and selected 
more than half the time (figure 4). 
The Demonstration
If we are allowed a presentation we will 
demonstrate PLOW live on a task selected by the 
audience. In addition, we would like to have the 
system available for an extended period of time 
during the conference so that attendees can spend 
time using the system to teach it simple tasks. The 
system runs on a laptop and all that is needed for 
a demo is internet access.

U: Let me show you how to find someone's publications 
U: Go to this webpage 
Navigates to http://scholar.google.com
U: Click on the advanced search link 
Clicks Advanced Scholar Search 
U: Put the author's name here 
Types the name in the Author text field 
U: Click the search button 
Clicks on the Search Scholar button 
U: OK here is the list of results 
Selects the table on page
PLOW: Can you check that I understand the data. 
PLOW: puts up a new window with the results. 
U: OK this is good.
U: this is the article title 
Highlights a title 
PLOW: attempts to find all titles and displays them
U: This is wrong.
PLOW OK
U: This is another article title 
Highlights another correct title 
PLOW: recomputes all the titles and displays them
Switches back to Scholar window
U: OK click next to get more results
Clicks the Next link 
PLOW: When should I stop searching?
U: Get thirty results 
PLOW: OK. I will do that
PLOW: iterates through pages until it gets 30 results
PLOW: I?m done.
U: We're done with the demonstration 
U: Let's practice
PLOW: what is the name of the author?
Enters a new name
PLOW executes the procedure successfully!!
