Detecting Turnarounds in Sentiment Analysis: Thwarting 
 
  
  
Abstract 
Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted 
territories in sentiment analysis, the for-
mer because of the lack of training corpo-
ra and the latter because of the enormous 
amount of world knowledge it demands. 
In this paper, we propose a working defi-
nition of thwarting amenable to machine 
learning and create a system that detects if 
the document is thwarted or not. We focus 
on identifying thwarting in product re-
views, especially in the camera domain. 
An ontology of the camera domain is cre-
ated. Thwarting is looked upon as the 
phenomenon of polarity reversal at a 
higher level of ontology compared to the 
polarity expressed at the lower level.   
This notion of thwarting defined with re-
spect to an ontology is novel, to the best 
of our knowledge. A rule based imple-
mentation building upon this idea forms 
our baseline. We show that machine learn-
ing with annotated corpora (thwarted/non-
thwarted) is more effective than the rule 
based system. Because of the skewed dis-
tribution of thwarting, we adopt the Area-
under-the-Curve measure of performance. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first attempt at the difficult problem of 
thwarting detection, which we hope will at 
least provide a baseline system to compare 
against.

2 Introduction 
Although much research has been done in the 
field of sentiment analysis (Liu et al, 2012), 
thwarting and sarcasm are not addressed, to the 
best of our knowledge. Thwarting has been iden-
tified as a common phenomenon in sentiment 
analysis (Pang et al, 2002, Ohana et al, 2009, 
Brooke, 2009) in various forms of texts but no 
previous work has proposed a solution to the 
problem of identifying thwarting. We focus on 
identifying thwarting in product reviews. 
The definition of an opinion as specified in 
Liu (2012) is  
?An opinion is a quintuple, (   ,     ,      , 
  ,   ), where    is the name of an entity,     is 
an aspect of   ,       is the sentiment on aspect 
    of entity   ,    is the opinion holder, and     
is the time when the opinion is expressed by   .? 
 
If the sentiment towards the entity or one of its 
important attribute contradicts the sentiment to-
wards all other attributes, we can say that the 
document is thwarted.

A domain ontology is an ontology of various 
features pertaining to a domain, arranged in a 
hierarchy. Subsumption in this hierarchy implies 
that the child is a part or feature of the parent. 
Domain ontology has been used by various 
works in NLP (Saggion et al, 2007 and Polpinij 
et al, 2008). In our work, we use domain ontol-
ogy of camera. We look upon thwarting as the 
phenomenon of reversal of polarity from the 
lower level of the ontology to the higher level. At 
the higher level of ontology the entities men-
tioned are the whole product or a large critical 
part of the product. So while statements about 
entities at the lower level of the ontology are on 
?details?, statements about entities at higher lev-
els are on the ?big picture?. Polarity reversal 
from details to the big picture is at the heart 
of thwarting. 
The motivation for our study on thwarting 
comes from the fact that: a) Thwarting is a chal-
lenging NLP problem and b) Special ML ma-
chinery is needed in view of the fact that the 
training data is so skewed. Additionally large 
amount of world and domain knowledge maybe 
called for to solve the problem. In spite of the 
relatively fewer occurrence of the thwarting phe-
nomenon the problem poses an intellectually 
stimulating exercise. We may also say that in the 
limit, thwarting approaches the very difficult 
problem of sarcasm detection (Tsur et al 2010). 
We start by defining and understanding the 
problem of thwarting in section 2. In section 3, 
we describe a method to create the domain on-
tology. In section 4, we propose a na?ve rule 
based approach to detect thwarting. In section 5 
we discuss a machine learning based approach 
which could be used to identify whether a docu-
ment is thwarted or not. This is followed by ex-
perimental results in section 6. Section 7 draws 
conclusions and points to future work. 
3 Definition 
Thwarting is defined by Pang et al, (2008) as 
follows:  
?Thwarted expectations basically refer to the 
phenomenon wherein the author of the text first 
builds up certain expectations for the topic, only 
to produce a deliberate contrast to the earlier 
discussion."       
 
For our computational purposes, we define 
thwarting as:  
?The phenomenon wherein the overall polarity of 
the document is in contrast with the polarity of 
majority of the document.? 
 
This definition emphasizes thwarting as piggy-
backing on sentiment analysis to improve the 
latter?s performance. The current work however 
only addresses the problem of whether a docu-
ment is thwarted or not and does not output the 
sentiment of the document. The basic block dia-
gram for our system is shown in figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Basic Block Diagram 
 
An example of a thwarted document is: 
?I love the sleek design. The lens is impressive. 
The pictures look good but, somehow this cam-
era disappoints me. I do not recommend it.? 
 
While thwarting occurs in various forms of sen-
timent bearing texts, it is not a very frequent one. 
It accounts for hardly 1-2% of any given corpus. 
Thus, it becomes hard to find sufficient number 
of examples of thwarting to train a classifier.  
Since thwarting is a complex natural language 
phenomenon we require basic NLP tools and 
resources, whose accuracy in turn can affect the 
overall performance of a thwarting detection sys-
tem. 
4 Building domain ontology 
Domain ontology comprises of features and enti-
ties from the domain and the relationships be-
tween them. The process thus has two steps, viz. 
(a) identify the features and entities, and (b) con-
nect them in the form of a hierarchy. We decided 
to use a combination of review corpora mining 
and manual means for identifying key features. 
Our approach to building the domain ontology is 
as follows: 
Step 1: We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
(LDA) (Blei et al, 2003) on a corpus containing 
reviews of a particular product (camera, in our 
case) to identify key features from the domain. 
The output is then analyzed manually to finally 
select the key features. Some additional features 
get added by human annotator to increase the 
coverage of the ontology. For Example, in the 
camera domain, the corpus may include words 
Thwarting 
Detection 
System 
Input 
 Document 
Thwarted or 
 Not -Thwarted 
861
 
 
like memory, card, gb, etc. but, may not contain 
the word storage. The abstract concept of stor-
age is contributed by the human annotator 
through his/her world knowledge. 
Step 2: The features thus obtained are ar-
ranged in the form of a hierarchy by a human 
annotator.

5 A rule based approach to thwarting 
recognition 
As per the definition of thwarting, most of the 
thwarted document carries a single sentiment; 
however, a small but critical portion of the text, 
carrying the contrary sentiment, actually decides 
the overall polarity. The critical statement, thus, 
should be strongly polar (either positive or nega-
tive), and it should be on some critical feature of 
the product. 
From the perspective of the domain ontology, the 
sentiment towards the overall product or towards 
some critical feature mentioned near the root of 
the ontology should be opposite to the sentiment 
towards features near the leaves. 
 
Based on these observations we propose the fol-
lowing na?ve approach to thwarting detection: 
 
For each sentence in a review to be tested 
   1. Get the dependency parse of the sentence. 
This step is essential. It makes explicit the adjec-
tive noun dependencies, which in turn uncovers 
the sentiment on a specific part or feature of the 
product. 
   2. Identify the polarities towards all nouns, us-
ing the dependency parse and sentiment lexicons.    
   3. If a domain feature, identified using the do-
main ontology, exists in the sentence, anno-
tate/update the ontology node, containing the 
feature, using the polarity obtained. 
Once the entire review is processed, we obtain 
the domain ontology, with polarity marking on 
nodes, for the corresponding review. 
The given review is thwarted if there is a con-
tradiction of sentiment among different levels of 
the domain ontology with polarity marking on 
nodes. 
The sentiment lexicons used are SentiWord-
Net (Esuli et al, 2006), Taboada (Taboada et al, 
2004), BL lexicon (Hu et al, 2004) and Inquirer 
(Stone et al, 1966). 
The procedure is illustrated by an example.  
?I love the sleek design. The lens is impressive. 
The pictures look good but, somehow this cam-
era disappoints me. I do not recommend it.? 
 
A part of the ontology, with polarity marking on 
nodes, for this example is shown in figure 3. 
 
Figure 3: ontology with polarity marking on nodes: 
example 
Based on this ontology we see that there is an 
opposition of sentiment between the root (?cam-
era?) and the lower nodes. We thus determine 
that this document is thwarted. 
However, since the nodes, within the same 
level, might have different weighting based upon 
the product under consideration, this method 
fails to perform well. For example, the body and 
video capability might be subjective whereas any 
fault in the lens or the battery will render the 
camera useless, hence they are more critical. We 
thus see a need for relative weighting among all 
features in the ontology. 
Camera - 
negative 
Lens  - 
positive 
Body 
Design - 
positive 
Display 
Picture - 
positive

6 A Machine Learning based approach 
Manual fixing of relative weightages for the fea-
tures of the product is possible, but that would be 
ad hoc. We now propose a machine learning 
based approach to detect thwarting in documents. 
It uses the domain ontology to identify key fea-
tures related to the domain. The approach in-
volves two major steps namely learning the 
weights and building a model that classifies the 
reviews using the learnt weights. 
6.1  Learning Weights 
The weights are learnt using the loss-
regularization framework. The key idea is that 
the overall polarity of the document is deter-
mined by the polarities of individual words in the 
document. Since, we need to find the weights for 
the nodes in the domain ontology; we consider 
only the words belonging to the ontology for fur-
ther processing. Thus, if P is the polarity of the 
review and    is the polarity associated with 
word i then   ?        gives the linear model. 
The word i should belong to the ontology as well 
as the review. Similarly, the hinge loss is given 
by               where w is the weight 
vector and x is the feature vector consisting of   
    .  
Based on the intuition, that every word con-
tributes some polarity to its parent node in the 
domain ontology, we also learnt weights on the 
ontology by percolating polarities towards the 
root. We experimented with complete percola-
tion, wherein the polarity at a node is its polarity 
in the document summed with the polarities of 
all its descendants. We also define controlled 
percolation, wherein the value added for a par-
ticular descendant is a function of its distance 
from the node. We halved the polarity value per-
colated, for each edge between the two nodes. 
Thus, for the example in figure 2, the polarity 
value of camera would be 
                  
     
 
 
     
 
  
        
 
  
       
 
  
        
 
 
Where         is the final polarity for camera 
and       is the polarity of the word ? {camera, 
body, display, design, picture}.  
6.2 Classifier 
We use the SVM classifier with features generat-
ed using the following steps. We first create a 
vector of weighted polarity values for each re-
view. This is constructed by generating a value 
for each word in the domain ontology encoun-
tered while reading the review sequentially. The 
value is calculated by multiplying the weight, 
found in the previous step (5.1), with the polarity 
of the word as determined from the sentence. 
Since, these vectors will be of different dimen-
sionality for each review, we extract features 
from these reviews. These features are selected 
based on our understanding of the problem and 
the fact that thwarting is a function of the change 
of polarity values and also the position of 
change. 
The Features extracted are: 
Document polarity, number of flips of sign (i.e. 
change of polarity from positive to negative and 
vice versa), the maximum and minimum values 
in a sequence, the length of the longest contigu-
ous subsequence of positive values (LCSP), the 
length of the longest contiguous subsequence of 
negative values (LCSN), the mean of all values, 
total number of positive values in the sequence, 
total number of negative values in the sequence, 
the first and the last value in the sequence, the 
variance of the moving averages, the difference 
in the means of LCSP and LCSN. 
7 Results 
Experiments were performed on a dataset ob-
tained by crawling product reviews from Ama-
zon1 . We focused on the camera domain. We 
obtained 1196 reviews from this domain. The 
reviews were annotated for thwarting, i.e., 
thwarted or non-thwarted as well as polarity. The 
reviews crawled were given to three different 
annotators. The instructions given for annotation 
were as follows: 
1. Read the entire review and try to form a 
mental picture of how sentiment in the 
document is distributed. Ignore anything 
that is not the opinion of the writer. 
2. Try to determine the overall polarity of 
the document. The star rating of the doc-
ument can be used for this purpose. 
3. If the overall polarity of the document is 
negative but, most of the words in the 
document indicate positive sentiment, or 
vice versa, then consider the document 
as thwarted. 
Since, identifying thwarting is a difficult task 
even for humans, we calculated the Cohen?s 
kappa score (Cohen 1960) in order to determine 
the inter annotator agreement. It was found out to

be 0.7317. The annotators showed high agree-
ment (98%) in the non-thwarted class whereas 
they agreed on 70% of the thwarted documents. 
Out of the 1196 reviews, exactly 21 were 
thwarted documents, agreed upon by all annota-
tors. We used the Stanford Core NLP tools 2 
(Klein et al, 2003, Toutanova et al, 2003) for 
basic NL processing. The system was tested on 
the entire dataset.  
Since, the data is highly skewed; we used Area 
under the Curve (AUC) for the ROC curve as the 
measure of evaluation (Ling et al, 2003). The 
AUC for a random baseline is expected to be 
50%, and the rule based approach is close to the 
baseline (56.3%). 
Table 1 shows the results for the experiments 
with the machine learning model. We used the 
CVX3 library in Matlab to solve the optimization 
problem for learning weights and the LIBSVM4 
library to implement the svm classifier. In order 
to account for the data skew, we assign a class 
weight of 50 (determined empirically) to the 
thwarted instances and 1 for non-thwarted in-
stances in the classifier. All results were obtained 
using a 10 fold cross validation. The same da-
taset was used for this set of experiments.

We see that the overall system for identification 
of thwarting performs well for the weights ob-
tained using the linear model with a controlled 
percolation of polarity values in the ontology. 
The system outperforms both the random base-
line as well as the rule based system. These re-
sults though great are to be taken with a pinch of 
salt. The basic objective for creating a thwarting 
detection system was to include such a module in 
the general sentiment analysis framework. Thus, 
using document polarity as a feature contradicts 
the objective of sentiment analysis, which is to 
find the document polarity. Without the docu-

ment polarity feature, the values drop by 10% 
which is not acceptable. 
8 Conclusions and Future Work 
We have described a system for detecting thwart-
ing, based on polarity reversal between opinion 
on most parts of the product and opinion on the 
overall product or a critical part of the product. 
The parts of the product are related to one anoth-
er through an ontology. This ontology guides a 
rule based approach to thwarting detection, and 
also provides features for an SVM based learning 
system.  The ML based system scores over the 
rule based system. Future work consists in trying 
out the approach across products and across do-
mains, doing better ontology harnessing from the 
reviews and investing and searching for distribu-
tions and learning algorithms more suitable for 
the problem.
