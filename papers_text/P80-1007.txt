SHOULD COMPUTERS WRITE SPOKEN LANGUAGE?

Recently there has developed a great deal of interest in 
the differences between written and spoken language. I 
joined this trend a l ittle more than a year ago, and have 
been exploring not only what the specific dif ferences are, 
but also the reasons why they might exist. The approach 
I have taken has been to look for differences between the 
situations and processes involved in speaking on the one 
hand and writ ing on the other, and to speculate on how 
those differences might be responsible for the observable 
differences in the output, ~at  happens when we write 
and what happens when we speak are different things, both 
psychological ly and socially, and I have been trying to 
see how what we do in the two situations leads to the 
specific things that we find in writ ing and speaking. 
I occasional ly interact with the UNIX computer system at 
Berkeley, for various purposes. In the context of my 
concern about differences between writ ing and speaking, I 
have begun to wonder whether the kind of corm~unication we 
are used to receiving from computers is more like writ ing 
or speaking. You may think that computers obviously 
write to us. They send us messages that we can read off 
of a cathode ray tube, or that get printed out for us on 
a piece of paper. In that respect what computers produce 
is written language. But it comes at us in a way that is 
very different from the way written language usually does. 
Usually we are faced with a printed page on which the 
writ ing is all there, and has been there for a long time. 
The temporal process by which the writ ing was put there 
has absolutely no relevance to us as we peruse the page 
at our leisure. The timing of our reading is in no way 
control led by the timing by which the words were entered 
on the page. My computer terminal, on the other hand, 
is steadily chugging away, producing language before my 
eyes at the rate of 30 characters a second. Under some 
circumstances I could wait until it had produced a whole 
page before I began to read. But I don't usually do 
that. I eagerly follow the steady flow of letters as 
they appear, Just as I would eagerly l isten to the spoken 
sounds of someone who was tell ing me something I wanted 
to know. This processing in real time seems in that re- 
spect more like spoken language, although what is being 
produced is written. Furthermore, the computer system 
and I often, indeed characterist ical ly, engage in quick 
exchanges, much like conversations, which is not what I 
am accustomed to doing with written language. So I want 
to suggest that when it is looked at from the point of 
view of the dichotomy between written and spoken language, 
the computer language we normally deal with is neither 
fish nor foul. It is produced in written form, but on 
the other hand it is produced in real time, and we are 
able to respond and interact as we are not able to do 
with a printed page. 
Recent work seems to have shown that there are a number 
of features which are characterist ic of spoken language, 
and a number of other features characterist ic of written. 
It is not that spoken language never contains any of the 
features of writtenness, or that written language never 
contains any of the features of spokenness. It is only 
that certain features tend to be associated with one or 
the other medium, and that the features become more 
polarized as one approaches the extremes of col loquial-  
ness on the one hand, or of l i terariness on the other. 
In between one finds various mixtures of l iterary talk 
and conversational writing. 
In looking for reasons why these dist inguishing features 
exist, I have found it useful to attribute some of them 
to the temporal differences between writ ing and speaking, 
and some of them to the interactional differences. 
Temporally, writ ing as an activity is much slower than 
speaking. Speaking seems to be produced one "idea unit" 
at a time, each idea unit having a mean length of about 
2 seconds, or 6 words. Every so often a sequence of 
idea units ends in a fall ing pitch intonation of the 
sort we identify with the ending of a sentence. Pauses 
usual ly occur between idea units, and longer pauses be- 
tween sentences. The idea units within a spoken sen- 
tence tend to be strung together in a coordinate fashion, 
typically with the word "and" appearing as a link~ 
There is little of the fancy syntax we find in written 
language, by which some idea units are subordinated to 
and embedded within others.  It has been hypothesized 
that speakers' attention capacit ies are not great enough 
to al low them to engage in much elaborate syntax. The 
flow of idea units is enough to keep them occupied. 
Writing, on the other hand, is peculiar in that the pro- 
eess of writ ing itself occupies an inordinate amount of 
time, even though, once we get past the first grade, it 
doesn't require a great deal of attention. Thus, 
writers have a lot of extra time and attention avai lable 
to them, and apparently they often use it to construct 
elaborate sentences. As a result, whereas the sentences 
of spoken language have a dist inctly fragmented quality, 
those of written language tend to be more integrated, 
with much more attention paid to subordinating idea 
units within others in complex ways. This integration 
vs. fragmentation dimension seems to be at the root of 
a number of the features which dist inguish writing from 
speaking. 
The other dimension I have been interested in seems to 
result from the different relation writers and speakers 
have to their respective audiences. Whereas speakers 
can interact directly with their l isteners, obtaining 
ongoing confirmation, contradiction, and feedback, wri- 
ters cannot normally do so, but are constrained to pay 
more attention to producing something that will  stand on 
its own feet when it is read by someone later on in a 
dif ferent place. We can speak of the greater involve- 
ment of speakers, as contrasted with the greater detach- 
ment of writers. Many of the specific features dist in- 
guishing speaking and writ ing can be lined up on this 
involvement vs. detachment dimension. 
How can a computer produce language that is maximally 
congenial to us humans, given the famil iarity we already 
have with the characterist ics of spoken and written 
language? ~hat kind of human language should a computer 
simulate, in order that we can process it most easily? 
And to what extent is a computer able to produce such a 
simulation? 
Let's play with the assumption that we human users would 
feel most at home with a computer terminal with which we 
could converse in something resembling human conversa- 
tion, as close as this can be approximated by a machine 
which (I) can't yet make satisfactory sounds, but has to 
write what it says; and (2) doesn't know how to experi-  
ence involvement with a human being. Let's consider 
what this machine would need to do to make us feel that 
we were interacting in something like the way we inter- 
act when we use spoken language. 
Timing is one of the important factors. Instead of 
steadily producing letters at the rate of 30 a second, 
this machine might try producing language as spoken 
language is produced in real time. That would mean 
doing it at half the speed, for one thing: 15 charac- 
ters a second would be about normal for the way we 
assimilate spoken language, and perhaps the rate at 
27 
which we naturally take in information But we woul9 
not want it spitting out one letter at a time at a 
steady rate, as it does now. That has little to do 
with the way we take in language, either spoken or 
written, under normal circumstances. Perhaps it should 
give us one word at a time, but I think it more likely 
that we would feel most comfortable with syllables: syl- 
lables timed to simulate the timing of syllables in nor- 
mal English speech. Roughly speaking, stressed syllables 
would be longer and unstressed syllables shorter. A 
careful study of the timing of natural speech could 
introduce more sophistication here. At the end of each 
idea unit -- on the average after every 6 words -- there 
would be at lease a brief pause, signaling the boundary 
of the idea unit and allowing time for processing. At 
the end of a sentence -- on the average after every 3 
ides units -- the pause would be longer, and paragraph 
boundaries would be signaled by lonBer pauses. Idea 
units would be relatively fragented. Many of them would 
be connected by "end," and there would be little of the 
elaborate syntax one tends to find in written lenguage. 
As for involvement, the computer would need to learn 
that humans are imperfect recipients of information, end 
that redundancy end requests for confirmation are among 
the important devices to be used frequently in c~un i -  
catlng with them. Frequent direct reference to the 
addressee is another feature of involvement that the 
computer could easily learn to use. 
My terminal recently told me the following, at 30 steady 
characters per second" 
The "netlpr" co-----d, when executed between 
computer center machines, now sets the owner- 
ship of net queue files correctly so that 
"netrm" will remove them end they are listed 
by the "netq" comm"ud. 
While this is reasonably good written language, and com- 
prehensible as such, I am asking whether meaningful lin- 
guistic interaction in real time might not better proceed 
somethinB as follows, where you can imagine syllables 
oeing timed as they are timed in spoken English, brief 
pauses at the ends of l lne~ end longer pauses where I 
have double-spaced (T is the terminal end U the user): 
T: Want to know about the "netlpr" command, 
where you type in "netlpr"? 
U: Sure. 
T: You can just use it between computer center 
machines, 
OK? 
Only if you're up here. 
U: Yeah, 
I know. 
T: OK. 
It'll show you who owns net queue files, 
if you went to know that. 
You ten use "nets"  to get rid of the~, 
and you can get them listed with "netq". 
That clear? 
U: Yeah. 
One problem with this is that the user has to type 
at his or her normal typing rate, which will inevitably 
be much slower than speaking. But even so, the frag- 
mentation and involvement which make this machine's out- 
put more like spoken language might significantly 
i nc rease  the  user ' s  comfor t  end comprehens ion .  To know 
whether that is really true calls for further detailed 
research on the features which distinguish spoken from 
written language, and tests of whether the introduction 
of such features into computer lenguege indeed makes a 
difference. Such research ought in any case to be 
rewarding beyond the bounds of this particular appli- 
cation.
