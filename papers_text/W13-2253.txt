Abstract 
This paper is to describe our machine transla-
tion evaluation systems used for participation 
in the WMT13 shared Metrics Task. In the 
Metrics task, we submitted two automatic MT 
evaluation systems nLEPOR_baseline and 
LEPOR_v3.1. nLEPOR_baseline is an n-gram 
based language independent MT evaluation 
metric employing the factors of modified sen-
tence length penalty, position difference penal-
ty, n-gram precision and n-gram recall. 
nLEPOR_baseline measures the similarity of 
the system output translations and the refer-
ence translations only on word sequences. 
LEPOR_v3.1 is a new version of LEPOR met-
ric using the mathematical harmonic mean to 
group the factors and employing some linguis-
tic features, such as the part-of-speech infor-
mation. The evaluation results of WMT13 
show LEPOR_v3.1 yields the highest average-
score 0.86 with human judgments at system-
level using Pearson correlation criterion on 
English-to-other (FR, DE, ES, CS, RU) lan-
guage pairs. 
1 Introduction 
Machine translation has a long history since the 
1950s (Weaver, 1955) and gains a fast develop-
ment in the recent years because of the higher 
level of computer technology. For instances, Och 
(2003) presents Minimum Error Rate Training 
(MERT) method for log-linear statistical ma-
chine translation models to achieve better trans-
lation quality; Menezes et al (2006) introduce a 
syntactically informed phrasal SMT system for 
English-to-Spanish translation using a phrase 
translation model, which is based on global reor-
dering and the dependency tree; Su et al (2009) 
use the Thematic Role Templates model to im-
prove the translation; Costa-juss? et al (2012) 
develop the phrase-based SMT system for Chi-
nese-Spanish translation using a pivot language. 
With the rapid development of Machine Transla-
tion (MT), the evaluation of MT has become a 
challenge in front of researchers. However, the 
MT evaluation is not an easy task due to the fact 
of the diversity of the languages, especially for 
the evaluation between distant languages (Eng-
lish, Russia, Japanese, etc.). 
2 Related works 
The earliest human assessment methods for ma-
chine translation include the intelligibility and 
fidelity used around 1960s (Carroll, 1966), and 
the adequacy (similar as fidelity), fluency and 
comprehension (improved intelligibility) (White 
et al, 1994). Because of the expensive cost of 
manual evaluations, the automatic evaluation 
metrics and systems appear recently. 
The early automatic evaluation metrics in-
clude the word error rate WER (Su et al, 1992) 
and position independent word error rate PER 
(Tillmann et al, 1997) that are based on the Le-
venshtein distance. Several promotions for the 
MT and MT evaluation literatures include the 
ACL?s annual workshop on statistical machine 
translation WMT (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Calli-
son-Burch et al, 2012), NIST open machine 
translation (OpenMT) Evaluation series (Li, 
2005) and the international workshop of spoken 
language translation IWSLT, which is also orga-
nized annually from 2004 (Eck and Hori, 2005; 
414
Paul, 2008, 2009; Paul, et al, 2010; Federico et 
al., 2011). 
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) is one of the 
commonly used evaluation metrics that is de-
signed to calculate the document level precisions. 
NIST (Doddington, 2002) metric is proposed 
based on BLEU but with the information weights 
added to the n-gram approaches. TER (Snover et 
al., 2006) is another well-known MT evaluation 
metric that is designed to calculate the amount of 
work needed to correct the hypothesis translation 
according to the reference translations. TER in-
cludes the edit categories such as insertion, dele-
tion, substitution of single words and the shifts of 
word chunks. Other related works include the 
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) that uses 
semantic matching (word stem, synonym, and 
paraphrase), and (Wong and Kit, 2008), (Popovic, 
2012), and (Chen et al, 2012) that introduces the 
word order factors, etc. The traditional evalua-
tion metrics tend to perform well on the language 
pairs with English as the target language. This 
paper will introduce the evaluation models that 
can also perform well on the language pairs that 
with English as source language. 
3 Description of Systems 
3.1 Sub Factors 
Firstly, we introduce the sub factor of modified 
length penalty inspired by BLEU metric. 
 
    {
   
 
            
                  
   
 
            
 (1) 
 
In the formula,    means sentence length 
penalty that is designed for both the shorter or 
longer translated sentence (hypothesis translation) 
as compared to the reference sentence. Parame-
ters   and   represent the length of candidate 
sentence and reference sentence respectively. 
Secondly, let?s see the factors of n-gram pre-
cision and n-gram recall. 
 
    
              
                           
 (2) 
 
    
              
                          
  (3) 
 
The variable                represents the 
number of matched n-gram chunks between hy-
pothesis sentence and reference sentence. The n-
gram precision and n-gram recall are firstly cal-
culated on sentence-level instead of corpus-level 
that is used in BLEU (  ). Then we define the 
weighted n-gram harmonic mean of precision 
and recall (WNHPR). 
 
          (?       (        
 
    (4) 
 
Thirdly, it is the n-gram based position differ-
ence penalty (NPosPenal). This factor is de-
signed to achieve the penalty for the different 
order of successfully matched words in reference 
sentence and hypothesis sentence. The alignment 
direction is from the hypothesis sentence to the 
reference sentence. It employs the  -gram meth-
od into the matching period, which means that 
the potential matched word will be assigned 
higher priority if it also has nearby matching. 
The nearest matching will be accepted as a back-
up choice if there are both nearby matching or 
there is no other matched word around the poten-
tial pairs. 
 
                 (5) 
 
     
 
          
?      
         
    (6) 
 
                             (7) 
 
The variable           means the length of 
the hypothesis sentence; the variables 
          and           represent the posi-
tion number of matched words in hypothesis sen-
tence and reference sentence respectively.  
3.2 Linguistic Features 
The linguistic features could be easily employed 
into our evaluation models. In the submitted ex-
periment results of WMT Metrics Task, we used 
the part of speech information of the words in 
question. In grammar, a part of speech, which is 
also called a word class, a lexical class, or a lexi-
cal category, is a linguistic category of lexical 
items. It is generally defined by the syntactic or 
morphological behavior of the lexical item in 
question. The POS information utilized in our 
metric LEPOR_v3.1, an enhanced version of 
LEPOR (Han et al, 2012), is extracted using the 
Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 2006) for English, 
German, and French languages, using COM-
POST Czech morphology tagger (Collins, 2002) 
for Czech language, and using TreeTagger 
(Schmid, 1994) for Spanish and Russian lan-
guages respectively.

Table 2. The performances of nLEPOR_baseline and LEPOR_v3.1 systems on WMT11 corpora 
 
3.3 The nLEPOR_baseline System 
The nLEPOR_baseline system utilizes the simple 
product value of the factors: modified length 
penalty, n-gram position difference penalty, and 
weighted n-gram harmonic mean of precision 
and recall. 
 
                           (8) 
 
The system level score is the arithmetical 
mean of the sentence level evaluation scores. In 
the experiments of Metrics Task using the 
nLEPOR_baseline system, we assign N=1 in the 
factor WNHPR, i.e. weighted unigram harmonic 
mean of precision and recall. 
3.4 The LEPOR_v3.1 System 
The system of LEPOR_v3.1 (also called as 
hLEPOR) combines the sub factors using 
weighted mathematical harmonic mean instead 
of the simple product value. 
 
        
                   
   
  
 
          
         
 
    
   
 (9) 
 
Furthermore, this system takes into account 
the linguistic features, such as the POS of the 
words. Firstly, we calculate the hLEPOR score 
on surface words            (the closeness of 
the hypothesis translation and the reference 
translation). Then, we calculate the hLEPOR 
score on the extracted POS sequences 
          (the closeness of the corresponding 
POS tags between hypothesis sentence and refer-
ence sentence). The final score             is 
the combination of the two sub-scores 
           and          .

4 Evaluation Method 
In the MT evaluation task, the Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient method is usually used by 
the authoritative ACL WMT to evaluate the cor-
relation of different MT evaluation metrics. So 
we use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient 
  to evaluate the performances of 
nLEPOR_baseline and LEPOR_v3.1 in system 
level correlation with human judgments. When 
there are no ties,   is calculated using: 
 
     
 ?  
 
 (     
  (11) 
 
The variable    is the difference value be-
tween the ranks for         and   is the number 
of systems. We also offer the Pearson correlation 
coefficient information as below. Given a sample 
of paired data (X, Y) as (      ,         , the 
Pearson correlation coefficient is: 
 
     
? (      (

5 Experiments 
5.1 Training 
In the training stage, we used the officially re-
leased data of past WMT series. There is no Rus-
sian language in the past WMT shared tasks. So 
we trained our systems on the other eight lan-
guage pairs including English to other (French, 
German, Spanish, Czech) and the inverse transla-
tion direction. In order to avoid the overfitting 
problem, we used the WMT11 corpora as train-
ing data to train the parameter weights in order to 
achieve a higher correlation with human judg-
ments at system-level evaluations. For the 
nLEPOR_baseline system, the tuned values of   
and   are 9 and 1 respectively for all language 
pairs except for (   ,    ) for CS-EN lan-
guage pair. For the LEPOR_v3.1 system, the 
tuned values of weights are shown in Table 1. 
The evaluation scores of the training results on 
WMT11 corpora are shown in Table 2. The de-
signed methods have shown promising correla-
tion scores with human judgments at system lev-
el, 0.87 and 0.77 respectively for 
nLEPOR_baseline and LEPOR_v3.1 of the mean 
score on eight language pairs. As compared to 
METEOR, BLEU and TER, we have achieved 
higher correlation scores with human judgments.  
5.2 Testing 
In the WMT13 shared Metrics Task, we also 
submitted our system performances on English-
to-Russian and Russian-to-English language 
pairs. However, since the Russian language did 
not appear in the past WMT shared tasks, we 
assigned the default parameter weights to Rus-
sian language for the submitted two systems. The 
officially released results on WMT13 corpora are 
shown in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 respec-
tively for system-level and segment-level per-
formance on English-to-other language pairs.

Table 4. System-level Spearman rank correlation 
scores on WMT13 English-to-other language 
pairs 
 
Table 3 shows LEPOR_v3.1 and 
nLEPOR_baseline yield the highest and the sec-
ond highest average Pearson correlation score 
0.86 and 0.85 respectively with human judg-
ments at system-level on five English-to-other 
language pairs. LEPOR_v3.1 and 
417
nLEPOR_baseline also yield the highest Pearson 
correlation score on English-to-Russian (0.77) 
and English-to-Czech (0.82) language pairs re-
spectively. The testing results of LEPOR_v3.1 
and nLEPOR_baseline show better correlation 
scores as compared to METEOR (0.81), BLEU 
(0.80) and TER-moses (0.75) on English-to-other 
language pairs, which is similar with the training 
results.  
On the other hand, using the Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient, SIMPBLEU_RECALL 
yields the highest correlation score 0.85 with 
human judgments. Our metric LEPOR_v3.1 also 
yields the highest Spearman correlation score on 
English-to-Russian (0.85) language pair, which 
is similar with the result using Pearson correla-
tion and shows its robust performance on this 
language pair.

Table 5. Segment-level Kendall?s tau correlation 
scores on WMT13 English-to-other language 
pairs 
 
However, we find a problem in the Spearman 
rank correlation method. For instance, let two 
evaluation metrics MA and MB with their evalu-
ation scores   ??????                   and  
  ???? ??                   respectively reflecting 
three MT systems  
 ??            . Before the calculation of cor-
relation with human judgments, they will be 
converted into   ??????  ?          and   ???? ??  ?          
with the same rank sequence using Spearman 
rank method; thus, the two evaluation systems 
will get the same correlation with human judg-
ments whatever are the values of human judg-
ments. But the two metrics reflect different re-
sults indeed: MA gives the outstanding score 
(0.95) to M1 system and puts very low scores 
(0.50 and 0.45) on the other two systems M2 and 
M3 while MB thinks the three MT systems have 
similar performances (scores from 0.74 to 0.77). 
This information is lost using the Spearman rank 
correlation methodology. 
The segment-level performance of 
LEPOR_v3.1 is moderate with the average Ken-
dall?s tau correlation score 0.10 on five English-
to-other language pairs, which is due to the fact 
that we trained our metrics at system-level in this 
shared metrics task. Lastly, the officially released 
results on WMT13 other-to-English language 
pairs are shown in Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8 
respectively for system-level and segment-level 
performance.

Table 6. System-level Pearson correlation scores 
on WMT13 other-to-English language pairs 
 
METEOR yields the highest average correla-
tion scores 0.95 and 0.94 respectively using 
Pearson and Spearman rank correlation methods 
on other-to-English language pairs. The average 
performance of nLEPOR_baseline is a little bet-
ter than LEPOR_v3.1 on the five language pairs 
of other-to-English even though it is also moder-
ate as compared to other metrics. However, using 
418
the Pearson correlation method, 
nLEPOR_baseline yields the average correlation 
score 0.87 which already wins the BLEU (0.86) 
and TER (0.80) as shown in Table 6.

scores on WMT13 other-to-English language

Once again, our metrics perform moderate at 
segment-level on other-to-English language pairs 
due to the fact that they are trained at system-
level. We notice that some of the evaluation met-
rics do not submit the results on all the language 
pairs; however, their performance on submitted 
language pair is sometimes very good, such as 
the dfki_logregFSS-33 metric with a segment-
level correlation score 0.27 on German-to-
English language pair. 
6 Conclusion 
This paper describes our participation in the 
WMT13 Metrics Task. We submitted two sys-
tems nLEPOR_baseline and LEPOR_v3.1. Both 
of the two systems are trained and tested using 
the officially released data. LEPOR_v3.1 yields 
the highest Pearson correlation average-score 
0.86 with human judgments on five English-to-
other language pairs, and nLEPOR_baseline 
yields better performance than LEPOR_v3.1 on 
other-to-English language pairs. Furthermore, 
LEPOR_v3.1 shows robust system-level perfor-
mance on English-to-Russian language pair, and 
nLEPOR_baseline shows best system-level per-
formance on English-to-Czech language pair us-
ing Pearson correlation criterion. As compared to 
nLEPOR_baseline, the experiment results of 
LEPOR_v3.1 also show that the proper use of 
linguistic information can increase the perfor-
mance of the evaluation systems.
