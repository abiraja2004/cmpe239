INTRODUCTION l 
The overall objective of the Cornell University 
TIPSTER Project was to improve end-user 
efficiency in information retrieval systems by 
reducing the amount of text that the user must 
process \[1\]. The project focuses on high 
precision IR, near-duplicate detection and 
context-dependent summarization. The two main 
foundations of the research are the latest version 
of the Smart system for information Retrieval 
and the Empire system for natural language 
processing. Smart is an implementation f the 
vector-space model of information retrieval (IR). 
Its earlier purpose was to provide a framework to 
conduct IR research but current developments 
will make the system easier to use by non- 
researcher. Empire is a research-oriented system 
that uses machine learning methods to quickly 
perform partial parsing of sentences. 
option, the system will attempt to retrieve fewer 
documents than it would in a normal search but 
within the returned hits list, most of the 
documents hould be useful. Emphasis on high 
precision, however, extracts a penalty in terms of 
recall. That is, some of the relevant documents 
or passages that are available in the stored text 
collection might not be returned to the user since 
the system will retrieve fewer documents overall. 
The high-precision option is optimized for 
users who have a specific information eed and a 
limited amount of time. This option would 
provide the user with a few piece of highly 
relevant data quickly but would not necessarily 
provide all the data. Alternatively, the user may 
opt to de-emphasize high precision in favor of 
improved recall but might suffer the 
consequences that arise from having to process 
an increased number of irrelevant documents. 
Cornell's integrated approach uses both 
statistical and linguistic sources to first identify 
relationships among important terms in the query 
or in the text. The integrated system then uses 
the extracted relationships to (1) discard or 
reorder retrieved texts (for high-precision IR); 
(2) locate redundant information (for near- 
duplicate document detection); or (3) generate 
summaries. A more detailed technical 
description about the research can be found in 
the Cornell University technical paper \[2\]. 
H IGH PRECIS ION INFORMATION 
RETRIEVAL  
The goal of this effort is to give the users 
the capability of conducting a high-precision 
search. If the user selects the high-precision

NEAR-DUPL ICATE DETECT ION 
The goal of the research in this area is to 
devise a system that will reduce the amount of 
duplicated information that the user sees. Current 
retrieval system may return several versions of a 
document in which the differences results from 
changes made to the metafile, word deviations in 
the body (e.g. multiple authors using different 
words to describe the same event) or an update 
with new information added. While other 
retrieval-enhancement algorithms have been 
developed to identify exact and near duplicates, 
this research effort investigates methods for 
processing documents that are similar but do not 
necessarily contain the same terms. For 
example: 
If a user has seen document X and the first 
two paragraphs of unseen document Y only 
contain information that is the same as or 
similar to information in X, the system 
would process Y to "hide" the duplicated 
37 
data showing the user only the unique 
paragraphs. An operational version of this 
system could be integrated with an agency's 
retrieval system to remove exact and almost 
duplicates from the retrieval system's hits 
list. This application probably would benefit 
most Intelligence Community analysts. 
Other types of users may be interested in 
capturing all duplicates, near-duplicates and 
similar documents. In this scenario a user 
tasked to process a collection of document 
consistently would want to identify all 
duplicate and similar documents for 
processing in the same or a similar manner. 
If the near-duplicate detection effort is 
successful, the resulting system would 
provide the user with this identification 
capability. 
CONTEXT-DEPENDENT 
SUMMARIZATION 
The third research area continues the 
objective of reducing the amount of text that the 
user must read by presenting summaries of long 
documents in lieu of the full documents. The 
summarization software will either provide a 
short summary for each document in a collection 
or one summary for an entire group of related 
documents. If the collection contains disparate 
document, the Cornell approach uses a 
preliminary step to group related documents and 
then applies the summarization algorithms to 
each group. 
Summarization will be done in the context 
of the query. The Cornell system will capture 
only those features relevant to the user's 
information eed. This is distinguishable from a 
generic summary that would capture the salient 
items for the entire document without regard to 
any particular search query or information eed. 
For example: 
Suppose the target document contains 
information on political profiles, military 
status, weapons proliferation issues and 
economic changes about a country of 
interest. A good generic summary would 
contain the essential elements on all four 
topics. If the user's only interest is the 
second topic, as would be reflected in the 
user-defined query, then a good context- 
dependent summary would contain only 
those elements that are relevant o military 
status. 
In a combined approach to summarization, the 
users will have the options of generic summaries 
or query-based summaries for each document in 
a collection or a cross-document summary for the 
entire collection. (See \[3\] for details on generic 
summarization.) 
DEMONSTRATION SYSTEMS 
The Cornell TIPSTER efforts will result in 
several proof-of-concept demonstration systems, 
one for each of the three major tasks. These 
demonstration systems for high-precision 
information retrieval, near-duplicate detection, 
and summarization will be sufficiently developed 
to allow the sponsor to evaluate their 
performance against real or simulated user data. 
Further development will be needed, particularly 
in the area of human to computer interfaces, to 
demonstrate he systems' utility to end users in 
an operational environment.
