ABSTRACT 
Interpreting fttUy natural speech is an important goal for spoken 
language understanding systems. However, while corpus studies 
have shown that about 10% of spontaneous tterances contain self- 
corrections, or REPAIRS, little is known about he extent to which cues 
in the speech signal may facilitate repair processing. We identify 
several cues based on acoustic and prosodic analysis of repairs in 
the DARPA Air Travel In.formation System database, and propose 
methods for exploiting these cues to detect and correct repairs. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Disfluencies inspontaneous speech pose serious problems for 
spoken language Systems. First, a speaker may produce a 
partial word or FRAGMEtCr, a string of phonemes that does 
not form the complete word intended by the speaker. Some 
fragments may coincidentally match words actually in the 
lexicon, as in (1); others will be identified with the acoustically 
closest lexicon item(s), as in (2). 1

leaving on Wednesday September fourth? 
(2) Actual string: What is the fare fro-- on American Airlines 
fourteen forty three 
Recognized string: With fare four American Airlines

Even if all words in a disfluent segment are correctly recog- 
nized, failure to detect the location of a disfluency may lead to 
interpretation errors during subsequent processing, as in (3):

Although studies of large speech corpora have found that 
approximately 10% of spontaneous tterances contain disflu- 
encies involving self-correction, or REPArRS \[2, 3\], little is 
known about how to integrate repair processing with real- 
time speech recognition and with incremental syntactic and 
semantic analysis of partial utterances in spoken language 
systems. In particular, the speech signal itself has been rel- 
atively unexplored as a source of processing cues that may 
facilitate the detection and correction of repairs. In this paper, 
we present results from a pilot study examining the acous- 
tic and prosodic haracteristics of all repairs (146) occurring 
in 1,453 utterances from the DARPA Air Travel Information 
System (ATIS) database. Our results are interpreted within 
a new "speech-first" framework for investigating repairs, the 
REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL, which builds upon Labov 1966 \[4\] 
and Hindle 1983 \[2\]. 
2. PREVIOUS COMPUTATIONAL 
APPROACKES 
While self-correction has long been a topic ofpsychoiinguistic 
study, computational work in this area has been sparse. Early 
work in computational linguistics included repairs as one type 
of ill-formed input and proposed solutions based upon exten- 
sions to existing text parsing techniques such as augmented 
transition etworks (ATNs), network-based semantic gram- 
mars, case flame grammars, pattern matching and determin- 
istic parsing \[5, 6, 2, 7, 8\]. Recently, Shriberg et al 1992 and 
Bear et al1992 \[3, 9\] have proposed atwo-stage method for 
processing repairs that integrates lexical, syntactic, seman- 
tic, and acoustic information, ha the first stage, lexical pattern 
matching rules are used to retrieve candidate r pair utterances. 
In the second stage, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic infor- 
mation is used to filter the true repairs from the false positives. 
By these methods, \[9\] report identifying 309 repairs in the 406 
utterances in their 10,718 utterance corpus which contained 
'nontrivial' repairs and incorrectly hypothesizing repairs in 
191 fluent utterances, which represents recall of 76% with 
precision of 62%. Of the 62% containing self-repairs, \[9\] 
report finding the appropriate correction for 57%. 
While Shriberg et al promote the important idea that au- 
tomatic repair handling requires integration of knowledge 
from multiple sources, we argue that such "text-first" pattern- 
329 
matching approaches suffer from several limitations. First, 
the assumption that correct ext transcriptions will be avail- 
able from existing speech recognizers i problematic, since 
current systems rely primarily upon language models and lex- 
icons derived from fluent speech to decide among competing 
acoustic hypotheses. These systems usually treat disfluencies 
in trainimg and recognition as noise; moreover, they have no 
way of modeling word fragments, even though these occur 
in the majority of repairs. Second, detection and correction 
strategies are defined in terms of ad hoc patterns; it is not 
clear how one repair type is related to another or how the set 
of existing patterns hould be augmented to improve perfor- 
mance. Third, from a computational point of view, it seems 
preferable that spoken language systems detect a repair as 
early as possible, to permit early pruning of the hypothesis 
space, rather than carrying along competing hypotheses, asin 
"text-first" approaches. Fourth, utterances containing over- 
lapping repairs such as (4) (noted in \[2, p. 123\]) cannot be 
handled by simple surface structure manipulations. 
(4) I think that it you get- it's more strict in Catholic schools. 
Finally, on a cognitive level, there is recent psycholinguistic 
evidence that humans detect repairs in the vicinity of the 
interruption point, well before the end of the repair utterance 
\[10, 11, 12\]. 
An exception to "text-first" approaches i Hindle 1983 \[2\]. 
Hindle decouples repair detection from repair correction. His 
correction strategies rely upon an inventory of three repair 
types that are defined in relation to independently formulated 
linguistic principles. Importantly, Hindle allows non-surface- 
based transformations as correction strategies. A related prop- 
erty is that the correction of a single repair may be achieved 
by sequential pplication of several correction rules. 
Hindle classifies repairs as 1) full sentence r starts, in which an 
entire utterance is re-initiated; 2) constituent repairs, in which 
one syntactic onstituent is replaced by another; 2 and 3) sur- 
face level repairs, in which identical strings appear adjacent 
to each other. Correction strategies for each repair type are 
defined in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser. The 
application of a correction routine is triggered by an hypoth- 
esized acoustic/phonetic EDIT SIGNAL, "a markedly abrupt 
cut-off of the speech signal" (Hindle 1983 \[2, p. 123\], cf. 
Labov 1966 \[4\]), which is assumed to mark the interruption 
of fluent speech. 
Hindie's methods achieved a success rate of 97% on a tran- 
scribed corpus of 1,500 sentences inwhich the edit signal was 
2This is consistent with Levelt 1983's \[13\] observation that the material 
to be replaced and the correcting material in a repair often share structural 
properties akin to those shared by coordinated constituents. 
orthographically represented. This rate of success uggests 
that identification of the edit signal site is crucial for repair 
correction. 
3. THE REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL 
In contrast to "text-first" approaches, we introduce an alterna- 
tive, "speech-first" model for repair detection/correction, the 
REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL (RIM). RIM provides a framework 
for testing the extent o which cues from the speech signal 
itself can contribute to the identification and correction of 
repair utterances. RIM incorporates two main assumptions 
of Hindle 1983 \[2\]: 1) correction strategies are linguistically 
rule-governed, and 2) linguistic cues must be available to 
signal when a disfluency has occurred and to 'trigger' cor- 
rection strategies. As Hindle \[2\] noted, if the processing of 
disfluencies were not rule-governed, it would be difficult to 
reconcile the infrequent intrusion of disfluencies on human 
speech comprehension, especially for language l arners, with 
their frequent rate of occurrence in spontaneous speech. We 
view Hindle's results as evidence supporting the first assump- 
tion. Our study tests the second assumption by exploring the 
acoustic and prosodic features of repairs that might serve as 
some kind of edit signal for rule-governed correction strate- 
gies. While text-first strategies rely upon 'triggers' of a lexical 
nature, we will argue that our speech-first model is consistent 
with psycholinguistic evidence concerning the human detec- 
tion of repairs, and is therefore cognitively plausible as well 
as linguistically principled. 
RIM divides the repair event into three consecutive t mpo- 
ral intervals and identifies time points within those intervals 
which are computationally critical. A full repair comprises 
three intervals, the REPARANDUM INTERVAL, the DISFLUENCY 
INTERVAL, and the REPAm INTERVAL. Following Levelt \[13\], 
we identify the REPARANDUM as the lexical material which is 
to be repaired. The end of the reparandum coincides with the 
termination of the fluent portion of the utterance and corre- 
sponds to the locus of the edit signal. We term this point the 
INTERRUPTION SITE (IS). The DISFLUENCY INTERVAL extends 
from the IS to the resumption of fluent speech, and may con- 
tain any combination of silence, pause fillers ('uh'), or CUE 
PHRASES ('Oops' or 'I mean'), which indicate the speaker's 
recognition of his/her performance error. RIM extends the 
edit signal hypothesis that repairs are phonetically signaled 
at the point of interruption to include acoustic-prosodic phe- 
nomena cross the disfluency interval. The REPAIR INTERVAL 
corresponds tothe uttering of the correcting material, which is 
intended to 'replace' the reparandum. It extends from the off- 
set of the disfluency interval to the resumption of non-repair 
speech. In (5), for example, the reparandum occurs from 1 to 
2, the dis fluency interval from 2 to 3, and the repair interval 
from 3 to 4.

4. ACOUSTIC-PROSODIC  
CHARACTERIST ICS OF REPAIRS 
We report results from a pilot study on the acoustic and 
prosodic orrelates of repair events as defined in the RIM 
framework. Our corpus consisted of 1,453 utterances by 64 
speakers from the DARPA Airline Travel and Information 
System (ATIS) database \[14, 15\]. The utterances were col- 
lected at Texas Instruments and at SRI and will be referred to 
as the"TI set" and "SRI set," respectively. 132 (9.1%) of these 
utterances contained at least one repair, and 48 (75%) of the 
64 speakers produced at least one repair. We defined repairs 
for our study as the self-correction f one or more phonemes 
(up to and including sequences of words) in an utterance. 
Orthographic transcriptions of the utterances were prepared 
by DARPA contractors according to standardized conven- 
tions. The utterances were labeled at Bell Laboratories for 
word boundaries and intonational prominences and phras- 
ing following Pierrehumbert's description of English into- 
nation \[16, 17\]. Disfluencies were categorized as REPAIR 
(self-correction f lexicai material), HESITATION ("unnatural" 
interruption of speech flow without any following correction 
of lexical material), or OTHER DISFLUENCY. For RIM analy- 
sis, each of the three repair intervals was labeled. All speech 
analysis was carried out using Entropics WAVES software \[18\]. 
4.1. Identifying the Reparandum Interval 
From the point of view of repair detection and correction, 
acoustic-prosodic cues to the onset of the reparandum would 
clearly be useful in the choice of appropriate correction strat- 
egy. However, perceptual experiments by Lickley and several 
co-authors \[10, 11, 12\] show that humans do not  detect an 
oncoming disfluency as early as the onset of the reparandum. 
Subjects were  able to detect disfluencies in the vicinity of the 
disfluency interval - -  and sometimes before the last word of 
the reparandum. Reparanda ending in word fragments were 
among those few repairs ubjects detected at the interruption 
site (i.e. the RIM IS), but only a small number of the test 
stimuli contained such fragments \[11\]. In our corpus, about 
two-thirds of reparanda end in word fragments) 
Based on these xperimental results, the reparandum offset is 
the earliest time point where we would expect to find evidence 
of Labov's and Hindle's hypothesized it signal. In RIM, the 
notion of the edit signal is extended conceptually to include 
any phenomenon which may contribute to the perception of 
an "abrupt cut-off" of the speech signal - -  including phonetic 
cues such as coarticulation phenomena, word fragments, inter-

Our acoustic and prosodic analysis of the reparandum in= 
terval focuses on identifying acoustic-phonetic properties of 
word fragments, as well as additional phonetic ues marking 
the reparandum offset. 
To build a model of word fragmentation for eventual use in 
fragment identification, we first analyzed the length and initial 
phoneme classes of fragment repairs. Almost 90% of frag- 
ments in our corpus are one syllable or less in length (Table 1). 
Table 2 shows the distribution of initial phonemes for all frag- 
ments, for single syllable fragments, and for single consonant 
fragments. From Table 2 we see that single consonant frag- 
ments occur six times more often as fricatives than as the 
next most common phoneme class, stop consonants. How- 
ever, fricatives and stops occur almost equally as the initial 
consonant in single syllable fragments. So (regardless of the 
underlying distribution of lexical items in the corpus), we find 
a difference in the distribution of phonemic haracteristics of 
fragments based on fragment length, which can be modeled 
in fragment identification. 
We also analyzed the broad word class of the speaker's in- 
tended word for each fragment, where the intended word was 
recoverable. Table 3 shows that there is a clear tendency for 
fragmentation at the reparandum offset to occur on content 
words rather than function words. Therefore, systems that 
rely primarily on lexical, semantic or pragmatic processing 
to detect and correct repairs will be faced with the problem 
of reconstructing content words from very short fragments, a

One acoustic ue marking the IS which Bear et al \[9\] noted 
is the presence of INTERRUPTION GLOTFALIZATION, irregular 
glottal pulses, at the reparandum offset. This form of glottal- 
ization is acoustically distinct from laryngealization (creaky 
voice), which often occurs at the end of prosodic phrases; 
glottal stops, which often precede vowel-initial words; and 
epenthetic glottalization. In our corpus, 29.5% of reparanda 
offsets are marked by interruption glottalization. 5 Although 
interruption glottalization is usually associated with frag- 
ments, it is not the case that fragments are usually glottalized. 
In our database, 61.7% of fragments are not glottalized and 
16.3% of glottalized reparanda offsets are not fragments. 
Finally, sonorant endings of fragments in our corpus some- 
times exhibited coarticulatory effects of an unrealized subse- 
quent phoneme. When these effects occur with a following 
pause (see Section 4.2), they could be used to distinguish frag- 
ments from full phrase-final words - -  such as 'fli-' from "fly" 
in Example (1). 
To summarize, our corpus shows that most reparanda off- 
sets end in word fragments. These fragments are usually 
intended (where that intention is recoverable) tobe content 
words, are almost always short (one syllable or less) and 
show different distributions of initial phoneme class depend- 
ing on their length. Also, fragments are sometimes glottal- 
ized and sometimes exhibit coarticulatory effects of missing 
subsequent phonemes. These properties of the reparandum 
offset might be used in direct modeling of word fragmenta- 
tion in speech recognition systems, enabling repair detection 
for a majority of repairs using primarily acoustic-phonetic 
cues. Besides noting the potential of utilizing distributional 
regularities and other acoustic-phonetic cues in a speech-first 
approach to repair processing, we conclude that the difficulty 
of recovering intended words from generally short fragments 
makes a text-first approach inapplicable for the majority class 
of fragment repairs. 
4.2. Identifying the Disflueney Interval 
In the RIM model, the disfluency interval (DI) includes all 
cue phrases, filled pauses, and silence from the offset of the

of the fragments in our corpus.

reparandum to the onset of the repair. While the literature 
contains anumber of hypotheses about his interval (cf. \[19, 
3\]), our pilot study supports a new hypothesis associating 
fragment repairs and the duration of pauses following the IS. 
Table 4 shows the average duration of Dis in repair utter- 
ances compared to the average length of utterance-internal 
silent pauses for all fluent utterances in the ATIS TI set. Al- 
though, over all, Dis in repair utterances are shorter than 
utterance-internal p uses in fluent utterances, the difference 
is only weakly significant (p<.05, tstat=l.98, df=1325). If we 
break down the repair utterances based on fragmentation, we 
find that the DI duration for fragments i significantly shorter 
than for nonfragments (p<.01, tstat=2.81, df=139). The frag- 
ment DI duration is also significantly shorter than fluent pause 
intervals (p<.001, tstat=3.39, df=1268), while there is no sig- 
nificant difference for nonfragment DIs and fluent utterances. 
So, while DIs in general appear to be distinct from fluent 
pauses, our data indicate that the duration of Dis in fragment 
repairs could be exploited to identify these cases as repairs as 
well as to distinguish them from nonfragment repairs. While 
Shriberg et al claim that pauses can be used to distinguish 
false positives from true repairs for two of their patterns, they 
do not investigate he use of pansal duration as a primary cue 
for repair detection. 
4.3. Identifying the Repair 
Several influential studies of acoustic-prosodic repair cues 
have relied upon lexical, semantic, and pragmatic definitions 
of repair types \[20, 13\]. Levelt & Cutler 1983 \[20\] claim that 
repairs of erroneous information (ERROR REPAIRS) are marked 
by increased intonational prominence on the correcting in- 
formation, while other kinds of repairs such as additions to 
descriptions (APPROPgtnTE~ESS gEPAmS) generally are not. 
We investigated whether the repair interval is marked by spe- 
cial intonational prominence relative to the reparandum for 
repairs in our corpus. 
To obtain objective measures of relative prominence, we com- 
pared absolute f0 and energy in the sonorant center of the last 
accented lexical item in the reparandum with that of the first 
accented item in the repair interval. 6 We found a small but 
reliable increase in f0 from the end of the reparandum tothe 
beginning of the repair (mean=5.2 Hz, p<.001, tstat=3.16, 
df= 131). There was also a small but reliable increase in ampli- 
tude across the DI (mean=+2 db, p <.001, tstat=4.83, df= 131). 
We analyzed the same phenomena across utterance-internal 
fluent pauses for the ATIS TI set and found no similarly re- 
liable changes in either f0 or intensity - -  perhaps because 
the variation in the fluent population was much greater than 
the observed changes for the repair population. And when 
6We performed the same analysis for the last and first syllables in the 
reparandum and repair espectively; results did not substantially differ from 
those reported here for accented values.

Table 4: Duration of Disfluency Intervals vs. Utterance-Internal Fluent Pauses 
we compared the f0 and amplitude changes from reparandum 
to repair with those observed for fluent pauses, we found no 
significant differences between the two populations. 
So, while small but reliable differences in f0 and amplitude 
exist between the reparandum offset and the repair onset, we 
conclude that these differences do not help to distinguish re- 
pairs from fluent speech. Although it is not entirely straight- 
forward to compare our objective measures of intonational 
prominence with Levelt and Cutler's perceptual findings, our 
results provide only weak support for theirs. While we find 
small but significant changes in two correlates of intonational 
prominence from the reparandum to the repair, the distribu- 
tions of change in f0 and energy for our data are unimodal; 
when we separate r pairs in our corpus into Levelt and Cutler's 
error repairs and appropriateness repairs, statistical analysis 
does not support Levelt and Cutler's claim that only the former 
group is intonationally 'marked'. 
Previous tudies of disfluency have paid considerable atten- 
tion to the vicinity of the IS but little to the repair offset. Yet, 
locating the repair offset (the end of the correcting material) is 
crucial for the delimitation of segments over which correction 
strategies operate. One simple hypothesis we tested is that 
repair interval offsets are intonationally marked by minor or 
major prosodic phrase boundaries. We found that the repair 
offset co-occurs with minor phrase boundaries for 49% of TI 
set repairs. To see whether these boundaries were distinct 
from those in fluent speech, we compared the phrasing of re- 
pair utterances with phrasing predicted for the corresponding 
'correct' version of the utterance. To predict phrasing, we 
used a procedure reported by Wang & Hirschberg 1992 \[21\] 
that uses statistical modeling techniques to predict phrasing 
from a large corpus of labeled ATIS speech; we used a predic- 
tion tree that achieves 88.4% accuracy on the ATIS TI corpus. 
For the TI set, we found that, for 40% of all repairs, an actual 
boundary occurs at the repair offset where one is predicted; 
and for 33% of all repairs, no actual boundary occurs where 
none is predicted. For the remaining 27% of repairs for which 
predicted phrasing diverged from actual phrasing, for 10% a 
boundary occurred where none was predicted; for 17%, no 
boundary occurred when one was predicted. 
In addition to these difference observed at the repair off- 
set, we also found more general differences from predicted 
phrasing over the entire repair interval, which we hypothesize 
may be partly understood as follows: Two strong predic- 
tors of prosodic phrasing in fluent speech are syntactic on- 
stituency \[22, 23, 24\], especially the relative inviolability of 
noun phrases \[21\], and the length of prosodic phrases \[23, 25\]. 
On the one hand, we found occurrences ofphrase boundaries 
at repair offsets which occurred within larger NPs, as in (6), 
where it is precisely the noun modifier - -  not the entire noun 
phrase - -  which is corrected. 7 
(6) Show me all n-  round-trip I flights I from Pittsburgh I to 
Atlanta. 
We speculate that, by marking off the modifier intonationally, 
a speaker may signal that operations relating just this phrase 
to earlier portions of the utterance can achieve the proper 
correction of the disfluency. We also found cases of 'length- 
ened' intonational phrases in repair intervals, as illustrated in 
the single-phrase r parandum in (7), where the corresponding 
fluent version of the reparandum is predicted to contain four 
phrases. 
(7) What airport is it I is located I what is the name of the 
airport located in San Francisco 
Again, we hypothesize that the role played by this unusually 
long phrase is the same as that of early phrase boundaries 
in NPs discussed above. In both cases, the phrase boundary 
delimits a meaningful unit for subsequent correction strate- 
gies. For example, we might understand the multiple repairs 
in (7) as follows: First the speaker attempts a VP repair, with 
the repair phrase delimited by a single prosodic phrase 'is lo- 
cated'. Then the initially repaired utterance 'What airport is 
located" is itself repaired, with the reparadum again delimited 
by a single prosodic phrase, 'What is the name of the airport 
located in San Francisco'. 
While a larger corpus must be examined inorder to fully char- 
acterize the relationship between prosodic boundaries atrepair 
offsets and those in fluent speech, we believe that the differ- 
ences we have observed are promising. A general speech-first 
cue such as intonational phrasing could prove useful both 
for lexical pattern matching strategies as well as syntactic

constituent-based strategies, by delimiting the region in which 
these correction strategies must seek the repairing material. 
5. DISCUSSION 
In this paper, we propose a "speech-first" model, the Repair 
Interval Model, for studying repairs in spontaneous speech. 
This model divides the repair event into a reparandum inter- 
val, a di.sfluency interval, and a repair interval. We present 
empirical results from acoustic-phonetic and prosodic analy- 
sis of a corpus of spontaneous speech. In this study, we found 
that most reparanda offsets ended in word fragments, usually 
of (intended) content words, and that these fragments tended 
to be quite short and to exhibit particular acoustic-phonetic 
characteristics. We found that the disfluency interval could 
be distinguished from intonational phrase boundaries in flu- 
ent speech in terms of duration of pause, and that fragment 
and nonfragment repairs could also be distinguished from one 
another in terms of the duration of the disfluency interval. 
For our corpus, repair onsets could be distinguished from 
reparandum offsets by small but reliable differences in f0 and 
amplitude, and repair intervals differed from fluent speech 
in their characteristic prosodic phrasing. We are currently 
analyzing a larger sample of the ATIS corpus to test our ini- 
tial results and to evaluate other possible predictors of repair 
phenomena.
