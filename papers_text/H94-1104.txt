PROJECT GOALS 
1. To coordinate the design, development and distribution 
of speech and natural language corpora for the ARPA 
Spoken Language research community, and the use of these 
corpora for technology development and evaluation. 
2. To design, coordinate the implementation f,and analyze 
the results of performance assessment benchmark tests for 
ARPA's speech recognition and spoken language 
understanding systems. 
RECENT RESULTS 
1. Participated, with SRI International, in annotation and 
"bug fixes" for the ATIS MADCOW-colIected corpora. 
2. Installed BBN-developed and SRI-developed ATIS 
technology at NIST, and used this data to collect test and 
training data using subjects recruited from the Gaithersburg, 
MD area. 
3. Produced speech corpora on recordable and pressed CD- 
ROM media in collaboration with the Linguistic Data 
Consortium. 
4. Participated in discussions regarding implementation f 
the Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) glass box test protocols. 
5. Prepared for, and implemented benchmark tests for the 
Wall Street Journal-based Continuous Speech Recognition 
(WSJ-CSR) corpus using the Hub-and-Spoke t st paradigm 
and for the 46-city ATIS corpus. 
2. Participate in the ATIS SemEval effort, probably 
including the development of detailed test and reporting 
protocols for a "dry run" of an ATIS SemEval test. 
3. Collect additional ATIS data at NIST as appropriate. 
4. Continue to participate in the development of improved 
speech transcription and scoring procedures, in ATIS 
principles of Interpretation documents, and in cooperation 
with the annotators at SRI, in "bug-report adjudication". 
5. Review the use of phonologically-motivated string 
alignment software for use in scoring speech recognition 
system output. 
6. Prepare for and implement benchmark tests in the WSJ- 
CSR and ATIS domains in the November 1994 time frame. 
7. Participate in the endeavors of the CCCC and MADCOW 
communities... 
PLANS 
1. Continue to collaborate with the LDC, its data collection 
and annotation contractors, and the MADCOW community 
with regard to data collection, annotation, screening and 
quality control procedures, and (as appropriate), toproduce 
CD-ROMs for early release within the community of test 
participants.
