Abstract
In this paper, we investigate a full-fledged
supervised machine learning framework for
identifying English phrasal verbs in a given
context. We concentrate on those that we de-
fine as the most confusing phrasal verbs, in the
sense that they are the most commonly used
ones whose occurrence may correspond either
to a true phrasal verb or an alignment of a sim-
ple verb with a preposition.
We construct a benchmark dataset1 with 1,348
sentences from BNC, annotated via an Inter-
net crowdsourcing platform. This dataset is
further split into two groups, more idiomatic
group which consists of those that tend to be
used as a true phrasal verb and more compo-
sitional group which tends to be used either
way. We build a discriminative classifier with
easily available lexical and syntactic features
and test it over the datasets. The classifier
overall achieves 79.4% accuracy, 41.1% er-
ror deduction compared to the corpus major-
ity baseline 65%. However, it is even more
interesting to discover that the classifier learns
more from the more compositional examples
than those idiomatic ones.
1 Introduction
Phrasal verbs in English, are syntactically defined
as combinations of verbs and prepositions or parti-
cles, but semantically their meanings are generally
not the direct sum of their parts. For example, give
in means submit, yield in the sentence, Adam?s say-
ing it?s important to stand firm , not give in to ter-
rorists. Adam was not giving anything and he was
1http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/resources/PVC Data
not in anywhere either. (Kolln and Funk, 1998) uses
the test of meaning to detect English phrasal verbs,
i.e., each phrasal verb could be replaced by a single
verb with the same general meaning, for example,
using yield to replace give in in the aforementioned
sentence. To confuse the issue even further, some
phrasal verbs, for example, give in in the follow-
ing two sentences, are used either as a true phrasal
verb (the first sentence) or not (the second sentence)
though their surface forms look cosmetically similar.
1. How many Englishmen gave in to their emo-
tions like that ?
2. It is just this denial of anything beyond what is
directly given in experience that marks Berke-
ley out as an empiricist .
This paper is targeting to build an automatic learner
which can recognize a true phrasal verb from its
orthographically identical construction with a verb
and a prepositional phrase. Similar to other types
of MultiWord Expressions (MWEs) (Sag et al,
2002), the syntactic complexity and semantic id-
iosyncrasies of phrasal verbs pose many particular
challenges in empirical Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP). Even though a few of previous works
have explored this identification problem empiri-
cally (Li et al, 2003; Kim and Baldwin, 2009) and
theoretically (Jackendoff, 2002), we argue in this pa-
per that this context sensitive identification problem
is not so easy as conceivably shown before, espe-
cially when it is used to handle those more com-
positional phrasal verbs which are empirically used
either way in the corpus as a true phrasal verb or
a simplex verb with a preposition combination. In
addition, there is still a lack of adequate resources
or benchmark datasets to identify and treat phrasal
65
verbs within a given context. This research is also
an attempt to bridge this gap by constructing a pub-
licly available dataset which focuses on some of the
most commonly used phrasal verbs within their most
confusing contexts.
Our study in this paper focuses on six of the most
frequently used verbs, take, make, have, get, do
and give and their combination with nineteen com-
mon prepositions or particles, such as on, in, up
etc. We categorize these phrasal verbs according to
their continuum of compositionality, splitting them
into two groups based on the biggest gap within
this scale, and build a discriminative learner which
uses easily available syntactic and lexical features to
analyze them comparatively. This learner achieves
79.4% overall accuracy for the whole dataset and
learns the most from the more compositional data
with 51.2% error reduction over its 46.6% baseline.
2 Related Work
Phrasal verbs in English were observed as one kind
of composition that is used frequently and consti-
tutes the greatest difficulty for language learners
more than two hundred and fifty years ago in Samuel
Johnson?s Dictionary of English Language2. They
have also been well-studied in modern linguistics
since early days (Bolinger, 1971; Kolln and Funk,
1998; Jackendoff, 2002). Careful linguistic descrip-
tions and investigations reveal a wide range of En-
glish phrasal verbs that are syntactically uniform,
but diverge largely in semantics, argument struc-
ture and lexical status. The complexity and idiosyn-
crasies of English phrasal verbs also pose a spe-
cial challenge to computational linguistics and at-
tract considerable amount of interest and investi-
gation for their extraction, disambiguation as well
as identification. Recent computational research on
English phrasal verbs have been focused on increas-
ing the coverage and scalability of phrasal verbs by
either extracting unlisted phrasal verbs from large
corpora (Villavicencio, 2003; Villavicencio, 2006),
or constructing productive lexical rules to gener-
ate new cases (Villanvicencio and Copestake, 2003).
Some other researchers follow the semantic regular-
ities of the particles associated with these phrasal
verbs and concentrate on disambiguation of phrasal

verb semantics, such as the investigation of the most
common particle up by (Cook and Stevenson, 2006).
Research on token identification of phrasal verbs
is much less compared to the extraction. (Li et
al., 2003) describes a regular expression based sim-
ple system. Regular expression based method re-
quires human constructed regular patterns and can-
not make predictions for Out-Of-Vocabulary phrasal
verbs. Thus, it is hard to be adapted to other NLP
applications directly. (Kim and Baldwin, 2009) pro-
poses a memory-based system with post-processed
linguistic features such as selectional preferences.
Their system assumes the perfect outputs of a parser
and requires laborious human corrections to them.
The research presented in this paper differs from
these previous identification works mainly in two
aspects. First of all, our learning system is fully
automatic in the sense that no human intervention
is needed, no need to construct regular patterns or
to correct parser mistakes. Secondly, we focus our
attention on the comparison of the two groups of
phrasal verbs, the more idiomatic group and the
more compositional group. We argue that while
more idiomatic phrasal verbs may be easier to iden-
tify and can have above 90% accuracy, there is still
much room to learn for those more compostional
phrasal verbs which tend to be used either positively
or negatively depending on the given context.
3 Identification of English Phrasal Verbs
We formulate the context sensitive English phrasal
verb identification task as a supervised binary clas-
sification problem. For each target candidate within
a sentence, the classifier decides if it is a true phrasal
verb or a simplex verb with a preposition. Formally,
given a set of n labeled examples {xi, yi}ni=1, we
learn a function f : X ? Y where Y ? {?1, 1}.
The learning algorithm we use is the soft-margin
SVM with L2-loss. The learning package we use
is LIBLINEAR (Chang and Lin, 2001)3.
Three types of features are used in this discrimi-
native model. (1)Words: given the window size from
the one before to the one after the target phrase,
Words feature consists of every surface string of
all shallow chunks within that window. It can be
an n-word chunk or a single word depending on
3http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/?cjlin/liblinear/
66
the the chunk?s bracketing. (2)ChunkLabel: the
chunk name with the given window size, such as VP,
PP, etc. (3)ParserBigram: the bi-gram of the non-
terminal label of the parents of both the verb and
the particle. For example, from this partial tree (VP
(VB get)(PP (IN through)(NP (DT the)(NN day))),
the parent label for the verb get is VP and the par-
ent node label for the particle through is PP. Thus,
this feature value is VP-PP. Our feature extractor
is implemented in Java through a publicly available
NLP library4 via the tool called Curator (Clarke et
al., 2012). The shallow parser is publicly avail-
able (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001)5 and the parser
we use is from (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
3.1 Data Preparation and Annotation
All sentences in our dataset are extracted from BNC
(XML Edition), a balanced synchronic corpus con-
taining 100 million words collected from various
sources of British English. We first construct a list of
phrasal verbs for the six verbs that we are interested
in from two resources, WN3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998)
and DIRECT6. Since these targeted verbs are also
commonly used in English Light Verb Constructions
(LVCs), we filter out LVCs in our list using a pub-
licly available LVC corpus (Tu and Roth, 2011). The
result list consists of a total of 245 phrasal verbs.
We then search over BNC and find sentences for all
of them. We choose the frequency threshold to be
25 and generate a list of 122 phrasal verbs. Finally
we manually pick out 23 of these phrasal verbs and
sample randomly 10% extracted sentences for each
of them for annotation.
The annotation is done through a crowdsourcing
platform7. The annotators are asked to identify true
phrasal verbs within a sentence. The reported inner-
annotator agreement is 84.5% and the gold aver-
age accuracy is 88%. These numbers indicate the
good quality of the annotation. The final corpus
consists of 1,348 sentences among which, 65% with
a true phrasal verb and 35% with a simplex verb-
preposition combination.

3.2 Dataset Splitting
Table 1 lists all verbs in the dataset. Total is the to-
tal number of sentences annotated for that phrasal
verb and Positive indicated the number of examples
which are annotated as containing the true phrasal
verb usage. In this table, the decreasing percent-
age of the true phrasal verb usage within the dataset
indicates the increasing compositionality of these
phrasal verbs. The natural division line with this
scale is the biggest percentage gap (about 10%) be-
tween make out and get at. Hence, two groups are
split over that gap. The more idiomatic group con-
sists of the first 11 verbs with 554 sentences and 91%
of these sentences include true phrasal verb usage.
This data group is more biased toward the positive
examples. The more compositional data group has
12 verbs with 794 examples and only 46.6% of them
contain true phrasal verb usage. Therefore, this data
group is more balanced with respective to positive
and negative usage of the phrase verbs.

Table 1: The top group consists of the more idiomatic
phrasal verbs with 91% of their occurrence within the
dataset to be a true phrasal verb. The second group con-

3.3 Experimental Results and Discussion
Our results are computed via 5-cross validation. We
plot the classifier performance with respect to the
overall dataset, the more compositional group and
the more idiomatic group in Figure 1. The clas-
sifier only improves 0.6% when evaluated on the
idiomatic group. Phrasal verbs in this dataset are
more biased toward behaving like an idiom regard-
less of their contexts, thus are more likely to be cap-
tured by rules or patterns. We assume this may ex-
plain some high numbers reported in some previ-
ous works. However, our classifier is more effec-
tive over the more compositional group and reaches
73.9% accuracy, a 51.1% error deduction comparing
to its majority baseline. Phrasal verbs in this set tend
to be used equally likely as a true phrasal verb and
as a simplex verb-preposition combination, depend-
ing on their context. We argue phrasal verbs such as
these pose a real challenge for building an automatic
context sensitive phrasal verb classifier. The overall
accuracy of our preliminary classifier is about 79.4%
when it is evaluated over all examples from these
two groups.

Words is the most effective feature with respect to
the idiomatic group and the overall dataset. And the
chunk feature is more effective towards the compo-
sitional group, which may explain the linguistic in-
tuition that negative phrasal verbs usually do not be-
long to the same syntactic chunk.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we build a discriminative learner to
identify English phrasal verbs in a given context.
Our contributions in this paper are threefold. We
construct a publicly available context sensitive En-
glish phrasal verb dataset with 1,348 sentences from
BNC. We split the dataset into two groups according
to their tendency toward idiosyncrasy and compo-
sitionality, and build a discriminative learner which
uses easily available syntactic and lexical features to
analyze them comparatively. We demonstrate em-
pirically that high accuracy achieved by models may
be due to the stronger idiomatic tendency of these
phrasal verbs. For many of the more ambiguous
cases, a classifier learns more from the composi-
tional examples and these phrasal verbs are shown
to be more challenging.
