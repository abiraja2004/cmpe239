Abstract
We present a method for producing a
bird?s-eye view of statements that are ex-
pressed on Web pages on a given topic.
This method aggregates statements that
are relevant to the topic, and shows con-
tradictory and contrastive relations among
them. This view of contradictions and
contrasts helps users acquire a top-down
understanding of the topic. To realize
this, we extract such statements and re-
lations, including cross-document implicit
contrastive relations between statements,
in an unsupervised manner. Our experi-
mental results indicate the effectiveness of
our approach.
1 Introduction
The quantity of information on theWeb is increas-
ing explosively. Online information includes news
reports, arguments, opinions, and other coverage
of innumerable topics. To find useful information
from such a mass of information, people gener-
ally use conventional search engines such as Ya-
hoo! and Google. They input keywords to a search
engine as a query and obtain a list of Web pages
that are relevant to the keywords. They then use
the list to check several dozen top-ranked Web
pages one by one.
This method of information access does not
provide a bird?s-eye view of the queried topic;
therefore it can be highly time-consuming and dif-
ficult for a user to gain an overall understanding of
what is written on the topic. Also, browsing only
top-ranked Web pages may provide the user with
biased information. For example, when a user
direct contrastive statement ?A is more P than B?
contrastive keyword pair (A, B)
contradictory relation ?A is P? ? ?A is not P?
contrastive relation ?A is P? ? ?B is P (not P)?
Table 1: Overview of direct contrastive state-
ments, contrastive keyword pairs and contradic-
tory/contrastive relations. Note that ?P? is a pred-
icate.
searches for information on ?agaricus,? claimed
to be a health food, using a conventional search
engine, many commercial pages touting its health
benefits appear at the top of the ranks, while other
pages remain low-ranked. The user may miss an
existing Web page that indicates its unsubstanti-
ated health benefits, and could be unintentionally
satisfied by biased or one-sided information.
This paper proposes a method for produc-
ing a bird?s-eye view of statements that are ex-
pressed on Web pages on a given query (topic).
In particular, we focus on presenting contradic-
tory/contrastive relations and statements on the
topic. This presentation enables users to grasp
what arguing points exist and furthermore to see
contradictory/contrastive relations between them
at a glance. Presenting these relations and state-
ments is thought to facilitate users? understanding
of the topic. This is because people typically think
about contradictory and contrastive entities and is-
sues for decision-making in their daily lives.
Our system presents statements and relations
that are important and relevant to a given topic,
including the statements and relations listed in Ta-
ble 1. Direct contrastive statements compare two
entities or issues in a single sentence. The con-
trasted entities or issues are also extracted as con-
trastive keyword pairs. In addition to them, our

system shows contradictory and contrastive rela-
tions between statements. Contradictory relations
are the relations between statements that are con-
tradictory about an entity or issue. Contrastive
relations are the relations between statements in
which two entities or issues are contrasted.
In particular, we have the following two novel
contributions.
? We identify contrastive relations between
statements, which consist of in-document
and cross-document implicit relations.
These relations complement direct con-
trastive statements, which are explicitly
mentioned in a single sentence.
? We precisely extract direct contrastive state-
ments and contrastive keyword pairs in an
unsupervised manner, whereas most previ-
ous studies used supervised methods (Jindal
and Liu, 2006b; Yang and Ko, 2009).
Our system focuses on the Japanese language.
For example, Figure 1 shows examples of ex-
tracted statements on the topic ?gosei senzai?
(synthetic detergent). Rounded rectangles repre-
sent statements relevant to this topic. The first
statement is a direct contrastive statement, which
refers to a contrastive keyword pair, ?gosei sen-
zai? (synthetic detergent) and ?sekken? (soap).
The pairs of statements connected with a broad
arrow have contradictory relations. The pairs of
statements connected with a thin arrow have con-
trastive relations. Users not only can see what is
written on this topic at a glance, but also can check
out the details of a statement by following its links
to the original pages.
2 Related Work
Studies have been conducted on automatic extrac-
tion of direct contrastive sentences (comparative
sentences) for English (Jindal and Liu, 2006b) and
for Korean (Yang and Ko, 2009). They prepared a
set of keywords that serve as clues to direct con-
trastive sentences and proposed supervised tech-
niques on the basis of tagged corpora. We pro-
pose an unsupervised method for extracting direct
contrastive sentences without constructing tagged
corpora.
From direct contrastive sentences, Jindal and
Liu (2006a) and Satou and Okumura (2007) pro-
posed methods for extracting quadruples of (tar-
get, basis, attribute, evaluation). Jindal and Liu
(2006a) extracted these quadruples and obtained
an F-measure of 70%-80% for the extraction of
?target? and ?basis.? Since this extraction was
535
not their main target, they did not perform er-
ror analysis on the extracted results. Satou and
Okumura (2007) extracted quadruples from blog
posts. They provided a pair of named entities
for ?target? and ?basis,? whereas we automati-
cally identify such pairs. Ganapathibhotla and Liu
(2008) proposed a method for detecting which en-
tities (?target? and ?basis?) in a direct contrastive
statement are preferred by its author.
There is also related work that focuses on non-
contrastive sentences. Ohshima et al (2006) ex-
tracted coordinated terms, which are semantically
broader than our contrastive keyword pairs, using
hit counts from a search engine. They made use
of syntactic parallelism among coordinated terms.
Their task was to input one of coordinated terms
as a query, which is different from ours. Soma-
sundaran and Wiebe (2009) presented a method
for recognizing a stance in online debates. They
formulated this task as debate-side classification
and solved it by using automatically learned prob-
abilities of polarity.
To aggregate statements and detect relations be-
tween them, one of important modules is recogni-
tion of synonymous, entailed, contradictory and
contrastive statements. Studies on rhetorical
structure theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and
recognizing textual entailment (RTE) deal with
these relations. In particular, evaluative work-
shops on RTE have been held and this kind of re-
search has been actively studied (Bentivogli et al,
2009). The recent workshops of this series set up
a task that recognizes contradictions. Harabagiu
et al (2006), de Marneffe et al (2008), Voorhees
(2008), and Ritter et al (2008) focused on rec-
ognizing contradictions. For example, Harabagiu
et al (2006) used negative expressions, antonyms
and contrast discourse relations to recognize con-
tradictions. These methods only detect relations
between given sentences, and do not create a
bird?s-eye view.
To create a kind of bird?s-eye view, Kawahara et
al. (2008), Statement Map (Murakami et al, 2009)
and Dispute Finder (Ennals et al, 2010) identi-
fied various relations between statements includ-
ing contradictory relations, but do not handle con-
trastive relations, which are one of the important
relations for taking a bird?s-eye view on a topic.
Lerman and McDonald (2009) proposed a method
for generating contrastive summaries about given
two entities on the basis of KL-divergence. This
study is related to ours in the aspect of extracting
implicit contrasts, but contrastive summaries are
different from contrastive relations between state-
ments in our study.
3 Our Method
We propose a method for grasping overall infor-
mation on the Web on a given query (topic). This
method extracts and presents statements that are
relevant to a given topic, including direct con-
trastive statements and contradictory/contrastive
relations between these statements.
As a unit for statements, we use a predicate-
argument structure (also known as a case structure
and logical form). A predicate-argument struc-
ture represents a ?who does what? event. Pro-
cesses such as clustering, summarization, compar-
ison with other knowledge and logical consistency
verification, which are required for this study and
further analysis, are accurately performed on the
basis of predicate-argument structures. The ex-
traction of our target relations and statements is
performed via identification and aggregation of
synonymous, contrastive, and contradictory rela-
tions between predicate-argument structures.
As stated in section 1, we extract direct con-
trastive statements, contrastive keyword pairs, rel-
evant statements, contrastive relations and contra-
dictory relations. We do this with the following
steps:
1. Extraction and aggregation of predicate-
argument structures
2. Extraction of contrastive keyword pairs and
direct contrastive statements
3. Identification of contradictory relations
4. Identification of contrastive relations
Below, we first describe our method of extract-
ing and aggregating predicate-argument struc-
tures. Then, we explain our method of extract-
ing direct contrastive statements with contrastive
keyword pairs, and identifying contradictory and
contrastive relations in detail.

3.1 Extraction and Aggregation of
Predicate-argument Structures
A predicate-argument structure consists of a pred-
icate and one or more arguments that have a de-
pendency relation to the predicate.
We extract predicate-argument structures from
automatic parses of Web pages on a given topic
by using the method of Kawahara et al (2008).
We apply the following procedure to Web pages
that are retrieved from the TSUBAKI (Shinzato
et al, 2008) open search engine infrastructure, by
inputting the topic as a query.
1. Extract important sentences from each Web
page. Important sentences are defined as sen-
tences neighboring the topic word(s).
2. Obtain results of morphological analysis
(JUMAN1) and dependency parsing (KNP2)
of the important sentences, and extract
predicate-argument structures from them.
3. Filter out functional and meaningless
predicate-argument structures, which are
not relevant to the topic. Pointwise mutual
information between the entire Web and the
target Web pages for a topic is used.
Note that the analyses in step 2 are performed be-
forehand and stored in an XML format (Shinzato
et al, 2008).
Acquired predicate-argument structures vary
widely in their representations of predicates and
arguments. In particular, many separate predicate-
argument structures have the same meaning due to
spelling variations, transliterations, synonymous
expressions and so forth. To cope with this prob-
lem, we apply ?keyword distillation? (Shibata
et al, 2009), which is a process of absorbing
spelling variations, synonymous expressions and
keywords with part-of relations on a set of Web
pages about a given topic. As a knowledge source
to merge these expressions, this process uses a
knowledge base that is automatically extracted
from an ordinary dictionary and the Web. For
instance, the following predicate-argument struc-
tures are judged to be synonymous3.

3In this paper, we use the following abbreviations:
(1) a. sekken-wo
soap-ACC
tsukau
use
b. sopu-wo
soap-ACC
tsukau
use
c. sekken-wo
soap-ACC
shiyou-suru
utilize
We call the predicate-argument structures that
are obtained as the result of the above proce-
dure statement candidates. The final output of
our system consists of direct contrastive state-
ments (with contrastive keyword pairs), top-N
statements (major statements) in order of fre-
quency of statement candidates, and statements
with contradictory/contrastive relations. Contra-
dictory/contrastive relations are identified against
major statements by searching statement candi-
dates.
Another outcome of keyword distillation is a re-
sultant set of keywords that are important and rel-
evant to the topic. We call this set of keywords
relevant keywords, which also include words or
phrases in the query. Relevant keywords are used
to extract contrastive keyword pairs.
3.2 Extraction of Contrastive Keyword Pairs
and Direct Contrastive Statements
We extract contrastive keyword pairs from con-
trastive constructs, which are manually speci-
fied as patterns of predicate-argument structures.
Statements that contain contrastive constructs are
defined as direct contrastive statements.
For example, the following sentence is a typi-
cal direct contrastive statement, which contains a
contrastive verb ?chigau? (differ).
(2) sekken-wa
soap-TOP
gosei senzai-to
synthetic detergent-ABL
chigai,
differ
? ? ?
(soap differs from synthetic detergent, ? ? ?)
From this sentence, a contrastive keyword pair,
?sekken? (soap) and ?gosei senzai? (synthetic de-
tergent), is extracted. The above sentence is ex-
tracted as a direct contrastive statement.
We preliminarily evaluated this simple pattern-
based method and found that it has the following
three problems.
NOM (nominative), ACC (accusative), DAT (dative),
ABL (ablative), CMI (comitative), GEN (genitive) and
TOP (topic marker).
537
? Keyword pairs that are mentioned in a con-
trastive construct are occasionally not rele-
vant to the given topic.
? Non-contrastive keyword pairs are erro-
neously extracted due to omissions of at-
tributes and targets of comparisons.
? Non-contrastive keyword pairs that have an
is-a relation are erroneously extracted.
To deal with the first problem, we filter out key-
word pairs that are contrastive but that are not rel-
evant to the topic. For this purpose, we apply fil-
tering by using relevant keywords, which are de-
scribed in section 3.1.
As an example of non-contrastive keyword
pairs (the second problem), from the following
sentence, a keyword pair, ?tokkyo seido? (patent
system) and ?nihon? (Japan), is incorrectly ex-
tracted by the pattern-based method.
(3) amerika-no
America-GEN
tokkyo seido-wa
patent system-TOP
nihon-to
Japan-ABL
kotonari,
different
? ? ?
(patent system of America is different from ? of
Japan ? ? ?)
In this sentence, ?nihon? (Japan) has a meaning of
?nihon-no tokkyo seido? (patent system of Japan).
That is to say, ?tokkyo seido? (patent system),
which is the attribute of comparison, is omitted.
In this study, in addition to patterns of con-
trastive constructs, we use checking and filtering
on the basis of similarity. The use of similarity
is inspired by the semantic parallelism between
contrasted keywords. As this similarity, we em-
ploy distributional similarity (Lin, 1998), which
is calculated using automatic dependency parses
of 100 million Japanese Web pages. By search-
ing similar keywords from the above sentence, we
successfully extract a contrastive keyword pair,
?amerika? (America) and ?nihon? (Japan), and
the above sentence as a direct contrastive state-
ment.
Similarly, a target of comparison can be omitted
as in the following sentence.
(4) nedan-wa
price-TOP
gosei senzai-yori
synthetic detergent-ABL
takaidesu
high
(price of ? is higher than synthetic detergent)
In this example, the similarity between ?nedan?
(price) and ?gosei senzai? (synthetic detergent) is
lower than a threshold, and this sentence and the
extracts from it are filtered out.
As for the third problem, we may extract non-
contrastive keyword pairs that have an is-a rela-
tion. From the following sentence, we incorrectly
extract a contrastive keyword pair, ?konbini? (con-
venience store) and ?7-Eleven,? which cannot be
filtered out due to its high similarity.
(5) 7-Eleven-wa
7-Eleven-TOP
hokano
other
konbini-to
convenience store-ABL
kurabete,
compare
? ? ?
(7-Eleven is ? ? ? compared to other convenience
stores)
To deal with this problem, we use a filter on the
basis of a set of words that indicate the existence
of hypernyms, such as ?hokano? (other) and ip-
panno (general). We prepare six words for this
purpose.
To sum up, we use the following procedure to
identify contrast keyword pairs.
1. Extract predicate-argument structures that do
not match the above is-a patterns and match
one of the following patterns. They are ex-
tracted from the statement candidates.
? X-wa Y-to {chigau | kotonaru | kuraberu}
(X {differ | vary | compare} from/with Y)
? X-wa Y-yori [adjective]
(X is more ? ? ? than Y)
Note that each of X and Y is a noun phrase
in the argument position.
2. Extract (x, y) that satisfies both the follow-
ing conditions as a contrastive keyword pair.
Note that (x, y) is part of a word sequence in
(X, Y), respectively.
? Both x and y are included in a set of rel-
evant keywords.
? (x, y) has the highest similarity among
any other candidates of (x, y), and this
similarity is higher than a threshold.
Note that the threshold is determined based on a
preliminary experiment using a set of synonyms
(Aizawa, 2007). We extract the sentence that con-
tains the predicate-argument structure used in step
1 as a direct contrastive statement.

3.3 Identification of Contradictory Relations
We identify contradictory relations between state-
ment candidates. In this paper, contradictory re-
lations are defined as the following two types
(Kawahara et al, 2008).
negation of predicate
If the predicate of a candidate statement is
negated, its contradiction has the same or synony-
mous predicate without negation. If not, its con-
tradiction has the same or synonymous predicate
with negation.
(6) a. sekken-ga
soap-NOM
kankyou-ni
environment-DAT
yoi
good
b. sekken-ga
soap-NOM
kankyou-ni
environment-DAT
yoku-nai
not good
antonym of predicate
The predicate of a contradiction is an antonym
of that of a candidate statement. To judge antony-
mous relations, we use an antonym lexicon ex-
tracted from a Japanese dictionary (Shibata et al,
2008). This lexicon consists of approximately
2,000 entries.
(7) a. gosei senzai-ga
synthetic detergent-NOM
anzen-da
safe
b. gosei senzai-ga
synthetic detergent-NOM
kiken-da
dangerous
To identify contradictory relations between
statements in practice, we search statement can-
didates that satisfy one of the above conditions
against major statements.
3.4 Identification of Contrastive Relations
We identify contrastive relations between state-
ment candidates. In this paper, we define a con-
trastive relation as being between a pair of state-
ment candidates whose arguments are contrastive
keyword pairs and whose predicates have synony-
mous or contradictory relations. Contradictory re-
lations of predicates are defined in the same way
as section 3.3.
In the following example, (a, b) and (a, c) have
a contrastive relation. Also, (b, c) has a contradic-
tory relation.
(8) a. gosei senzai-de
synthetic detergent-CMI

(bio-ethanol car, electric car)
Topic: citizen judgment system

Topic: patent system
? (patent system, utility model system)
(large enterprise, small enterprise)

word pairs (translated into English).

soap-CMI

stain-NOM
ochiru

c. sekken-de

The process of identifying contrastive relations
between statements is performed in the same way
as the identification of contradictory relations.
That is to say, we search statement candidates
that satisfy the definition of contrastive relations
against major statements.
4 Experiments
We conducted experiments for extracting con-
trastive keyword pairs, direct contrastive state-
ments and contradictory/contrastive relations on
50 topics, such as age of adulthood, anticancer
drug, bio-ethanol, citizen judgment system, patent
system and Windows Vista.
We retrieve at most 1,000 Web pages for a topic
from the search engine infrastructure, TSUBAKI.
As major statements, we extract 10 statement can-
didates in order of frequency.
Below, we first evaluate the extracted con-
trastive keyword pairs and direct contrastive state-
ments, and then evaluate the identified contradic-
tory and contrastive relations between statements.
4.1 Evaluation of Contrastive Keyword Pairs
and Direct Contrastive Statements
Contrastive keyword pairs and direct contrastive
statements were extracted on 30 of 50 topics. 99
direct contrastive statements and 73 unique con-
trastive keyword pairs were obtained on 30 topics.
The average number of obtained contrastive key-
word pairs for a topic was approximately 2.4. Ta-
539
Topic: ?tyosakuken hou? (copyright law)
?syouhyouken-wa tyosakuken-yori zaisantekina kachi-wo motsu.?
The trademark right has more financial value than the copyright.
?tyosakuken hou-de hogo-sareru? ? ?tyosakuken hou-de hogo-sare-nai?protected by the copyright law not protected by the copyright law
?tyosakuken-wo shingai-suru? ? ?tyosakuken-wo shingai-shi-nai?infringe the copyright not infringe the copyright
? ?syouhyouken-wo shingai-shi-nai?not infringe the trademark right
Topic: ?genshiryoku hatsuden syo? (nuclear power plant)
?genshiryoku hatsuden syo-wa karyoku hatsuden syo-to chigau.?
Nuclear power plants are different from thermoelectric power plants.
?CO2-wo hassei-shi-nai? ? ?CO2-wo hassei-suru?not emit carbon dioxide emit carbon dioxide
?genpatsu-wo tsukuru? ? ?genshiryoku hatsuden syo-wo tsukura-nai?construct a nuclear power plant not construct a nuclear power plant
? ?karyoku hatsuden syo-wo tsukuru?construct a thermoelectric power plant
Table 3: Examples of identified direct contrastive statements, contradictory relations and contrastive
relations. The sentences with two underlined parts are direct contrastive statements. The arrows ???
and ??? represent a contradictory relation and a contrastive relation, respectively.
ble 2 lists examples of obtained contrastive key-
word pairs. We successfully extracted not only
contrastive keyword pairs including topic words,
but also those without them.
Our manual evaluation of the extracted con-
trastive keyword pairs found that 89% (65/73) of
the contrastive keyword pairs are actually con-
trasted in direct contrastive statements. Correct
contrastive keyword pairs were extracted on 28 of
30 topics. We also evaluated the contrastive key-
word pairs extracted without similarity filtering.
In this case, 190 contrastive keyword pairs on 41
topics were extracted and 44% (84/190) of them
were correct. Correct contrastive keyword pairs
were extracted on 31 of 41 topics. Therefore, sim-
ilarity filtering did not largely decrease the recall,
but significantly increased the precision.
We have eight contrastive keyword pairs that
were incorrectly extracted by our proposed
method. These contrastive keyword pairs acciden-
tally have similarity that is higher than the thresh-
old. Major errors were caused by the ambiguity of
Japanese ablative keyword ?yori.?
(9) heisya-wa
our company-TOP
bitWallet sya-yori
bitWallet, Inc.-ABL
Edy gifuto-no
Edy gift-GEN
gyomu itaku-wo
entrustment-ACC
ukete-imasu
have
(Our company is entrusted with Edy gift by bitWal-
let, Inc.)
In this example, ?yori? means not the basis of
contrast but the source of action. The similar-
ity filtering usually prevents incorrect extraction
from such a non-contrastive sentence. However,
in this case, the pair of ?heisya? (our company)
and ?bitWallet sya? (bitWallet, Inc.) was not fil-
tered due to the high similarity between them. To
cope with this problem, it is necessary to use lin-
guistic knowledge such as case frames.
4.2 Evaluation of Contradictory and
Contrastive Relations
Contradictory relations were identified on 49 of
50 topics. For 49 topics, 268 contradictory re-
lations were identified. The average number of
identified contradictory relations for a topic was
5.5. Contrastive relations were identified on 18
of 30 topics, on which contrastive keyword pairs
were extracted. For the 18 topics, 60 contrastive
relations were identified. The average number of
identified contrastive relations for a topic was 3.3.
Table 3 lists examples of the identified contra-
dictory and contrastive relations as well as direct
contrastive statements. We manually evaluated
the identified contradictory relations and the con-
trastive relations that were identified for correct
contrastive keyword pairs. As a result, we con-
cluded that they completely obey our definitions.
We also classified each of the obtained contra-
dictory and contrastive relations into two classes:
?cross-document? and ?in-document.? ?Cross-

Topic: age of adulthood
lower the age of adulthood to 18

Table 4: Examples of unidentified contrastive re-
lations (translated into English).
document? means that a contradictory/contrastive
relation is obtained not from a single page but
across multiple pages. If a relation can be
obtained from both, we classified it into ?in-
document.? As a result, 67% (179/268) of contra-
dictory relations and 70% (42/60) of contrastive
relations were ?cross-document.? We can see that
many cross-document implicit relations that can-
not be retrieved from a single page were success-
fully identified.
4.3 Discussions
We successfully identified contradictory relations
on almost all the topics. However, out of 50 top-
ics, we extracted contrastive keyword pairs on 30
topics and contrastive relations on 18 topics. To
investigate the resultant contrastive relations from
the viewpoint of recall, we manually checked
whether there were unidentified contrastive rela-
tions among 100 statement candidates for each
topic. We actually checked 20 topics and found
six unidentified contrastive relations in total. Ta-
ble 4 lists examples of the unidentified contrastive
relations. Out of 20 topics, in total, 44 contrastive
relations are manually discovered on 13 topics,
but out of 13 topics, 38 contrastive relations are
identified on eight topics by our method. There-
fore, we achieved a recall of 86% (38/44) at rela-
tion level and 62% (8/13) at topic level. We can
see that our method was able to cover a relatively
wide range of contrastive relations on the topics
on which our method successfully extracted con-
trastive keyword pairs.
To detect such unidentified contrastive rela-
tions, it is necessary to robustly extract contrastive
keyword pairs. In the future, we will employ a
bootstrapping approach to identify patterns of di-
rect contrastive statements and contrastive key-

5 Conclusion
This paper has described a method for producing a
bird?s-eye view of statements that are expressed in
Web pages on a given topic. This method aggre-
gates statements relevant to the topic and shows
the contradictory/contrastive relations and state-
ments among them.
In particular, we successfully extracted direct
contrastive statements in an unsupervised man-
ner. We specified only several words for the
extraction patterns and the filtering. Therefore,
our method for Japanese is thought to be easily
adapted to other languages. We also proposed
a novel method for identifying contrastive rela-
tions between statements, which included cross-
document implicit relations. These relations com-
plemented direct contrastive statements.
We have incorporated our proposed method
into an information analysis system, WISDOM4
(Akamine et al, 2009), which can show multi-
faceted information on a given topic. Now, this
system can show contradictory/contrastive rela-
tions and statements as well as their contexts as
a view of KWIC (keyword in context) (Figure 2).
This kind of presentation facilitates users? under-
standing of an input topic.
