Abstract
Tree-to-string translation is syntax-aware and
efficient but sensitive to parsing errors. Forest-
to-string translation approaches mitigate the
risk of propagating parser errors into transla-
tion errors by considering a forest of alterna-
tive trees, as generated by a source language
parser. We propose an alternative approach to
generating forests that is based on combining
sub-trees within the first best parse through
binarization. Provably, our binarization for-
est can cover any non-consitituent phrases in
a sentence but maintains the desirable prop-
erty that for each span there is at most one
nonterminal so that the grammar constant for
decoding is relatively small. For the purpose
of reducing search errors, we apply the syn-
chronous binarization technique to forest-to-
string decoding. Combining the two tech-
niques, we show that using a fast shift-reduce
parser we can achieve significant quality gains
in NIST 2008 English-to-Chinese track (1.3
BLEU points over a phrase-based system, 0.8
BLEU points over a hierarchical phrase-based
system). Consistent and significant gains are
also shown in WMT 2010 in the English to
German, French, Spanish and Czech tracks.
1 Introduction
In recent years, researchers have explored a wide
spectrum of approaches to incorporate syntax and
structure into machine translation models. The uni-
fying framework for these models is synchronous
grammars (Chiang, 2005) or tree transducers
(Graehl and Knight, 2004). Depending on whether
or not monolingual parsing is carried out on the
source side or the target side for inference, there are
four general categories within the framework:
? string-to-string (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and
Venugopal, 2006)
? string-to-tree (Galley et al, 2006; Shen et al,
2008)
? tree-to-string (Lin, 2004; Quirk et al, 2005;
Liu et al, 2006; Huang et al, 2006; Mi et al,
2008)
? tree-to-tree (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al, 2008)
In terms of search, the string-to-x models explore all
possible source parses and map them to the target
side, while the tree-to-x models search over the sub-
space of structures of the source side constrained
by an input tree or trees. Hence, tree-to-x mod-
els are more constrained but more efficient. Mod-
els such as Huang et al (2006) can match multi-
level tree fragments on the source side which means
larger contexts are taken into account for transla-
tion (Poutsma, 2000), which is a modeling advan-
tage. To balance efficiency and accuracy, forest-to-
string models (Mi et al, 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008)
use a compact representation of exponentially many
trees to improve tree-to-string models. Tradition-
ally, such forests are obtained through hyper-edge
pruning in the k-best search space of a monolin-
gual parser (Huang, 2008). The pruning parameters
that control the size of forests are normally hand-
tuned. Such forests encode both syntactic variants
and structural variants. By syntactic variants, we re-
fer to the fact that a parser can parse a substring into
either a noun phrase or verb phrase in certain cases.
835
We believe that structural variants which allow more
source spans to be explored during translation are
more important (DeNeefe et al, 2007), while syn-
tactic variants might improve word sense disam-
biguation but also introduce more spurious ambi-
guities (Chiang, 2005) during decoding. To focus
on structural variants, we propose a family of bina-
rization algorithms to expand one single constituent
tree into a packed forest of binary trees containing
combinations of adjacent tree nodes. We control the
freedom of tree node binary combination by restrict-
ing the distance to the lowest common ancestor of
two tree nodes. We show that the best results are
achieved when the distance is two, i.e., when com-
bining tree nodes sharing a common grand-parent.
In contrast to conventional parser-produced-forest-
to-string models, in our model:
? Forests are not generated by a parser but by
combining sub-structures using a tree binarizer.
? Instead of using arbitary pruning parameters,
we control forest size by an integer number that
defines the degree of tree structure violation.
? There is at most one nonterminal per span so
that the grammar constant is small.
Since GHKM rules (Galley et al, 2004) can cover
multi-level tree fragments, a synchronous grammar
extracted using the GHKM algorithm can have syn-
chronous translation rules with more than two non-
terminals regardless of the branching factor of the
source trees. For the first time, we show that simi-
lar to string-to-tree decoding, synchronous binariza-
tion significantly reduces search errors and improves
translation quality for forest-to-string decoding.
To summarize, the whole pipeline is as follows.
First, a parser produces the highest-scored tree for
an input sentence. Second, the parse tree is re-
structured using our binarization algorithm, result-
ing in a binary packed forest. Third, we apply the
forest-based variant of the GHKM algorithm (Mi
and Huang, 2008) on the new forest for rule extrac-
tion. Fourth, on the translation forest generated by
all applicable translation rules, which is not neces-
sarily binary, we apply the synchronous binarization
algorithm (Zhang et al, 2006) to generate a binary
translation forest. Finally, we use a bottom-up de-
coding algorithm with intergrated LM intersection
using the cube pruning technique (Chiang, 2005).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we give an overview of the forest-to-
string models. In Section 2.1, we introduce a more
efficient and flexible algorithm for extracting com-
posed GHKM rules based on the same principle as
cube pruning (Chiang, 2007). In Section 3, we in-
troduce our source tree binarization algorithm for
producing binarized forests. In Section 4, we ex-
plain how to do synchronous rule factorization in a
forest-to-string decoder. Experimental results are in
Section 5.
2 Forest-to-string Translation
Forest-to-string models can be described as
e = Y( arg max
d?D(T ), T?F (f)
P (d|T ) ) (1)
where f stands for a source string, e stands for a tar-
get string, F stands for a forest, D stands for a set
of synchronous derivations on a given tree T , and
Y stands for the target side yield of a derivation.
The search problem is finding the derivation with
the highest probability in the space of all deriva-
tions for all parse trees for an input sentence. The
log probability of a derivation is normally a lin-
ear combination of local features which enables dy-
namic programming to find the optimal combination
efficiently. In this paper, we focus on the models
based on the Synchronous Tree Substitution Gram-
mars (STSG) defined by Galley et al (2004). In con-
trast to a tree-to-string model, the introduction of F
augments the search space systematically. When the
first-best parse is wrong or no good translation rules
are applicable to the first-best parse, the model can
recover good translations from alternative parses.
In STSG, local features are defined on tree-to-
string rules, which are synchronous grammar rules
defining how a sequence of terminals and nontermi-
nals on the source side translates to a sequence of
target terminals and nonterminals. One-to-one map-
ping of nonterminals is assumed. But terminals do
not necessarily need to be aligned. Figure 1 shows a
typical English-Chinese tree-to-string rule with a re-
ordering pattern consisting of two nonterminals and
different numbers of terminals on the two sides.

Figure 1: An example tree-to-string rule.
Forest-to-string translation has two stages. The
first stage is rule extraction on word-aligned parallel
texts with source forests. The second stage is rule
enumeration and DP decoding on forests of input
strings. In both stages, at each tree node, the task on
the source side is to generate a list of tree fragments
by composing the tree fragments of its children. We
propose a cube-pruning style algorithm that is suit-
able for both rule extraction during training and rule
enumeration during decoding.
At the highest level, our algorithm involves three
steps. In the first step, we label each node in the in-
put forest by a boolean variable indicating whether it
is a site of interest for tree fragment generation. If it
is marked true, it is an admissible node. In the case
of rule extraction, a node is admissible if and only if
it corresponds to a phrase pair according to the un-
derlying word alignment. In the case of decoding,
every node is admissible for the sake of complete-
ness of search. An initial one-node tree fragment is
placed at each admissible node for seeding the tree
fragment generation process. In the second step,
we do cube-pruning style bottom-up combinations
to enumerate a pruned list of tree fragments at each
tree node. In the third step, we extract or enumerate-
and-match tree-to-string rules for the tree fragments
at the admissible nodes.
2.1 A Cube-pruning-inspired Algorithm for
Tree Fragment Composition
Galley et al (2004) defined minimal tree-to-string
rules. Galley et al (2006) showed that tree-to-string
rules made by composing smaller ones are impor-
tant to translation. It can be understood by the anal-
ogy of going from word-based models to phrase-
based models. We relate composed rule extraction
to cube-pruning (Chiang, 2007). In cube-pruning,
the process is to keep track of the k-best sorted lan-
guage model states at each node and combine them
bottom-up with the help of a priority queue. We
can imagine substituting k-best LM states with k
composed rules at each node and composing them
bottom-up. We can also borrow the cube pruning
trick to compose multiple lists of rules using a pri-
ority queue to lazily explore the space of combina-
tions starting from the top-most element in the cube
formed by the lists.
We need to define a ranking function for com-
posed rules. To simulate the breadth-first expansion
heuristics of Galley et al (2006), we define the fig-
ure of merit of a tree-to-string rule as a tuple m =
(h, s, t), where h is the height of a tree fragment,
s is the number of frontier nodes, i.e., bottom-level
nodes including both terminals and non-terminals,
and t is the number of terminals in the set of frontier
nodes. We define an additive operator +:
m1 + m2
= ( max{h1, h2} + 1, s1 + s2, t1 + t2 )
and a min operator based on the order <:
m1 < m2 ??
?
?
?
h1 < h2 ?
h1 = h2 ? s1 < s2 ?
h1 = h2 ? s1 = s2 ? t1 < t2
The + operator corresponds to rule compositions.
The < operator corresponds to ranking rules by their
sizes. A concrete example is shown in Figure 2,
in which case the monotonicity property of (+, <)
holds: if ma < mb, ma +mc < mb +mc. However,
this is not true in general for the operators in our def-
inition, which implies that our algorithm is indeed
like cube-pruning: an approximate k-shortest-path
algorithm.
3 Source Tree Binarization
The motivation of tree binarization is to factorize
large and rare structures into smaller but frequent
ones to improve generalization. For example, Penn
Treebank annotations are often flat at the phrase
level. Translation rules involving flat phrases are un-
likely to generalize. If long sequences are binarized,

geometric measures (height, # frontiers,# frontier terminals), under the gluing rule of VP ? VBD VP?C.
The right part shows a cube view of the combination space. We explore the space from the top-left corner to the
neighbors.
the commonality of subsequences can be discov-
ered. For example, the simplest binarization meth-
ods left-to-right, right-to-left, and head-out explore
sharing of prefixes or suffixes. Among exponentially
many binarization choices, these algorithms pick a
single bracketing structure for a sequence of sibling
nodes. To explore all possible binarizations, we use
a CYK algorithm to produce a packed forest of bi-
nary trees for a given sibling sequence.
With CYK binarization, we can explore any span
that is nested within the original tree structure, but
still miss all cross-bracket spans. For example,
translating from English to Chinese, The phrase
?There is? should often be translated into one verb
in Chinese. In a correct English parse tree, however,
the subject-verb boundary is between ?There? and
?is?. As a result, tree-to-string translation based on
constituent phrases misses the good translation rule.
The CYK-n binarization algorithm shown in Al-
gorithm 1 is a parameterization of the basic CYK
binarization algorithm we just outlined. The idea is
that binarization can go beyond the scope of parent
nodes to more distant ancestors. The CYK-n algo-
rithm first annotates each node with its n nearest
ancestors in the source tree, then generates a bina-
rization forest that allows combining any two nodes
with common ancestors. The ancestor chain labeled
at each node licenses the node to only combine with
nodes having common ancestors in the past n gener-
ations.
The algorithm creates new tree nodes on the fly.
New tree nodes need to have their own states in-
dicated by a node label representing what is cov-
ered internally by the node and an ancestor chain
representing which nodes the node attaches to ex-
ternally. Line 22 and Line 23 of Algorithm 1 up-
date the label and ancestor annotations of new tree
nodes. Using the parsing semiring notations (Good-
man, 1999), the ancestor computation can be sum-
marized by the (?,?) pair. ? produces the ances-
tor chain of a hyper-edge. ? produces the ancestor
chain of a hyper-node. The node label computation
can be summarized by the (concatenate, min) pair.
concatenate produces a concatenation of node la-
bels. min yields the label with the shortest length.
A tree-sequence (Liu et al, 2007) is a sequence of
sub-trees covering adjacent spans. It can be proved
that the final label of each new node in the forest
corresponds to the tree sequence which has the min-
imum length among all sequences covered by the
node span. The ancestor chain of a new node is the
common ancestors of the nodes in its minimum tree
sequence.
For clarity, we do full CYK loops over all O(|w|2)
spans and O(|w|3) potential hyper-edges, where |w|
is the length of a source string. In reality, only de-
scendants under a shared ancestor can combine. If
we assume trees have a bounded branching factor
b, the number of descendants after n generations is
still bounded by a constant c = bn. The algorithm is
O(c3 ? |w|), which is still linear to the size of input
sentence when the parameter n is a constant.

Figure 3 shows some examples of alternative trees
generated by the CYK-n algorithm. In this example,
standard CYK binarization will not create any new
trees since the input is already binary. The CYK-2
and CYK-3 algorithms discover new trees with an
increasing degree of freedom.
4 Synchronous Binarization for
Forest-to-string Decoding
In this section, we deal with binarization of transla-
tion forests, also known as translation hypergraphs
(Mi et al, 2008). A translation forest is a packed
forest representation of all synchronous derivations
composed of tree-to-string rules that match the
source forest. Tree-to-string decoding algorithms
work on a translation forest, rather than a source for-
est. A binary source forest does not necessarily al-
ways result in a binary translation forest. In the tree-
to-string rule in Figure 4, the source tree is already

binary with the help of source tree binarization, but
the translation rule involves three variables in the set
of frontier nodes. If we apply synchronous binariza-
tion (Zhang et al, 2006), we can factorize it into
two smaller translation rules each having two vari-
ables. Obviously, the second rule, which is a com-
mon pattern, is likely to be shared by many transla-
tion rules in the derivation forest. When beams are
fixed, search goes deeper in a factorized translation
forest.
The challenge of synchronous binarization for a
forest-to-string system is that we need to first match
large tree fragments in the input forest as the first
step of decoding. Our solution is to do the matching
using the original rules and then run synchronous
binarization to break matching rules down to factor
rules which can be shared in the derivation forest.
This is different from the offline binarization scheme
described in (Zhang et al, 2006), although the core
algorithm stays the same.

5.1 Setup
For English-to-Chinese translation, we used all the
allowed training sets in the NIST 2008 constrained
track. For English to the European languages, we
used the training data sets for WMT 2010 (Callison-
Burch et al, 2010). For NIST, we filtered out sen-
tences exceeding 80 words in the parallel texts. For
WMT, the filtering limit is 60. There is no filtering
on the test data set. Table 1 shows the corpus statis-
tics of our bilingual training data sets.
Source Words Target Words
English-Chinese 287M 254M
English-Czech 66M 57M
English-French 857M 996M
English-German 45M 43M
English-Spanish 216M 238M
Table 1: The Sizes of Parallel Texts.
At the word alignment step, we did 6 iterations
of IBM Model-1 and 6 iterations of HMM. For
English-Chinese, we ran 2 iterations of IBM Model-
4 in addition to Model-1 and HMM. The word align-
ments are symmetrized using the ?union? heuris-
tics. Then, the standard phrase extraction heuristics
(Koehn et al, 2003) were applied to extract phrase
pairs with a length limit of 6. We ran the hierar-
chical phrase extraction algorithm with the standard
heuristics of Chiang (2005). The phrase-length limit
is interpreted as the maximum number of symbols
on either the source side or the target side of a given
rule. On the same aligned data sets, we also ran the
tree-to-string rule extraction algorithm described in
Section 2.1 with a limit of 16 rules per tree node.
The default parser in the experiments is a shift-
reduce dependency parser (Nivre and Scholz, 2004).
It achieves 87.8% labelled attachment score and
88.8% unlabeled attachment score on the standard
Penn Treebank test set. We convert dependency
parses to constituent trees by propagating the part-
of-speech tags of the head words to the correspond-
ing phrase structures.
We compare three systems: a phrase-based sys-
tem (Och and Ney, 2004), a hierarchical phrase-
based system (Chiang, 2005), and our forest-to-
string systemwith different binarization schemes. In
the phrase-based decoder, jump width is set to 8. In
the hierarchical decoder, only the glue rule is applied
840
to spans longer than 10. For the forest-to-string sys-
tem, we do not have such length-based reordering
constraints.
We trained two 5-gram language models with
Kneser-Ney smoothing for each of the target lan-
guages. One is trained on the target side of the par-
allel text, the other is on a corpus provided by the
evaluation: the Gigaword corpus for Chinese and
news corpora for the others. Besides standard fea-
tures (Och and Ney, 2004), the phrase-based decoder
also uses a Maximum Entropy phrasal reordering
model (Zens and Ney, 2006). Both the hierarchi-
cal decoder and the forest-to-string decoder only use
the standard features. For feature weight tuning, we
do Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003). To
explore a larger n-best list more efficiently in train-
ing, we adopt the hypergraph-based MERT (Kumar
et al, 2009).
To evaluate the translation results, we use BLEU
(Papineni et al, 2002).
5.2 Translation Results
Table 2 shows the scores of our system with the
best binarization scheme compared to the phrase-
based system and the hierarchical phrase-based sys-
tem. Our system is consistently better than the other
two systems in all data sets. On the English-Chinese
data set, the improvement over the phrase-based sys-
tem is 1.3 BLEU points, and 0.8 over the hierarchi-
cal phrase-based system. In the tasks of translat-
ing to European languages, the improvements over
the phrase-based baseline are in the range of 0.5 to
1.0 BLEU points, and 0.3 to 0.5 over the hierar-
chical phrase-based system. All improvements ex-
cept the bf2s and hier difference in English-Czech
are significant with confidence level above 99% us-
ing the bootstrap method (Koehn, 2004). To demon-
strate the strength of our systems including the two
baseline systems, we also show the reported best re-
sults on these data sets from the 2010 WMT work-
shop. Our forest-to-string system (bf2s) outperforms
or ties with the best ones in three out of four lan-
guage pairs.

vary the degree to generate forests that are incremen-
tally augmented from a single tree. Table 3 shows
the scores of different tree binarization methods for
the English-Chinese task.
It is clear from reading the table that cyk-2 is the
optimal binarization parameter. We have verified
this is true for other language pairs on non-standard
data sets. We can explain it from two angles. At
degree 2, we allow phrases crossing at most one
bracket in the original tree. If the parser is reason-
ably good, crossing just one bracket is likely to cover
most interesting phrases that can be translation units.
From another point of view, enlarging the forests
entails more parameters in the resulting translation
model, making over-fitting likely to happen.
5.4 Binarizer or Parser?
A natural question is how the binarizer-generated
forests compare with parser-generated forests in
translation. To answer this question, we need a

parser that can generate a packed forest. Our fast
deterministic dependency parser does not generate
a packed forest. Instead, we use a CRF constituent
parser (Finkel et al, 2008) with state-of-the-art ac-
curacy. On the standard Penn Treebank test set, it
achieves an F-score of 89.5%. It uses a CYK algo-
rithm to do full dynamic programming inference, so
is much slower. We modified the parser to do hyper-
edge pruning based on posterior probabilities. The
parser preprocesses the Penn Treebank training data
through binarization. So the packed forest it pro-
duces is also a binarized forest. We compare two
systems: one is using the cyk-2 binarizer to generate
forests; the other is using the CRF parser with prun-
ing threshold e?p, where p = 2 to generate forests.1
Although the parser outputs binary trees, we found
cross-bracket cyk-2 binarization is still helpful.

The results show that cyk-2 forest performs slightly

old is p = 10. The difference is that they do the forest pruning

forest-pruning on the full CYK chart. As a result, we need more
aggressive pruning to control forest size.
better than the parser forest. We have not done full
exploration of forest pruning parameters to fine-tune
the parser-forest. The speed of the constituent parser
is the efficiency bottleneck. This actually demon-
strates the advantage of the binarizer plus forest-to-
string scheme. It is flexible, and works with any
parser that generates projective parses. It does not
require hand-tuning of forest pruning parameters for
training.
5.5 Synchronous Binarization
In this section, we demonstrate the effect of syn-
chronous binarization for both tree-to-string and
forest-to-string translation. The experiments are on
the English-Chinese data set. The baseline systems
use k-way cube pruning, where k is the branching
factor, i.e., the maximum number of nonterminals on
the right-hand side of any synchronous translation
rule in an input grammar. The competing system
does online synchronous binarization as described in
Section 4 to transform the grammar intersected with
the input sentence to the minimum branching factor
k? (k? < k), and then applies k?-way cube pruning.
Typically, k? is 2.

Table 5: The effect of synchronous binarization for tree-
to-string and forest-to-string systems, on the English-
Chinese task.
Table 5 shows that synchronous binarization does
help reduce search errors and find better translations
consistently in all settings.
6 Related Work
The idea of concatenating adjacent syntactic cate-
gories has been explored in various syntax-based
models. Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) aug-
mented hierarchial phrase based systems with joint
syntactic categories. Liu et al (2007) proposed tree-
sequence-to-string translation rules but did not pro-
vide a good solution to place joint subtrees into con-
nection with the rest of the tree structure. Zhang et
842
al. (2009) is the closest to our work. But their goal
was to augment a k-best forest. They did not bina-
rize the tree sequences. They also did not put con-
straint on the tree-sequence nodes according to how
many brackets are crossed.
Wang et al (2007) used target tree binarization to
improve rule extraction for their string-to-tree sys-
tem. Their binarization forest is equivalent to our
cyk-1 forest. In contrast to theirs, our binarization
scheme affects decoding directly because we match
tree-to-string rules on a binarized forest.
Different methods of translation rule binarization
have been discussed in Huang (2007). Their argu-
ment is that for tree-to-string decoding target side
binarization is simpler than synchronous binariza-
tion and works well because creating discontinous
source spans does not explode the state space. The
forest-to-string senario is more similar to string-to-
tree decoding in which state-sharing is important.
Our experiments show that synchronous binariza-
tion helps significantly in the forest-to-string case.
7 Conclusion
We have presented a new approach to tree-to-string
translation. It involves a source tree binarization
step and a standard forest-to-string translation step.
The method renders it unnecessary to have a k-best
parser to generate a packed forest. We have demon-
strated state-of-the-art results using a fast parser and
a simple tree binarizer that allows crossing at most
one bracket in each binarized node. We have also
shown that reducing search errors is important for
forest-to-string translation. We adapted the syn-
chronous binarization technqiue to improve search
and have shown significant gains. In addition, we
also presented a new cube-pruning-style algorithm
for rule extraction. In the new algorithm, it is easy to
adjust the figure-of-merit of rules for extraction. In
the future, we plan to improve the learning of trans-
lation rules with binarized forests.
