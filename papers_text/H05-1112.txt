Abstract
This paper addresses the automatic clas-
sification of the semantic relations ex-
pressed by the English genitives. A learn-
ing model is introduced based on the sta-
tistical analysis of the distribution of gen-
itives? semantic relations on a large cor-
pus. The semantic and contextual fea-
tures of the genitive?s noun phrase con-
stituents play a key role in the identifica-
tion of the semantic relation. The algo-
rithm was tested on a corpus of approx-
imately 2,000 sentences and achieved an
accuracy of 79% , far better than 44% ac-
curacy obtained with C5.0, or 43% ob-
tained with a Naive Bayes algorithm, or
27% accuracy with a Support Vector Ma-
chines learner on the same corpus.
1 Introduction
1.1 Problem Description
The identification of semantic relations in open text
is at the core of Natural Language Processing and
many of its applications. Detecting semantic rela-
tions is useful for syntactic and semantic analysis of
text and thus plays an important role in automatic
text understanding and generation. Furthermore, se-
mantic relations represent the core elements in the
organization of lexical semantic knowledge bases
used for inferences. Recently, there has been a re-
newed interest in text semantics fueled in part by
the complexity of some major research initiatives
in Question Answering, Text Summarization, Text
Understanding and others, launched in the United
States and abroad.
Two of the most frequently used linguistic con-
structions that encode a large set of semantic rela-
tions are the s-genitives, e.g. ?man?s brother?, and
the of-genitives, e.g. ?dress of silk?. The interpreta-
tion of these phrase-level constructions is paramount
for various applications that make use of lexical se-
mantics.
Example: ?The child?s mother had moved the child
from a car safety seat to an area near the open
passenger-side door of the car.? (The Desert Sun,
Monday, October 18th, 2004).
There are two semantic relations expressed by
genitives: (1) ?child?s mother? is an s-genitive en-
coding a KINSHIP relation, and (2) ?passenger-side
door of the car? is an of-genitive encoding a PART-
WHOLE relation.
This paper provides a detailed corpus analysis of
genitive constructions and a model for their auto-
matic interpretation in English texts.
1.2 Semantics of Genitives
In English there are two kinds of genitives. In gen-
eral, in one, the modifier is morphologically linked
to the possessive clitic ?s and precedes the head noun
(s-genitive, i.e. NPmodif ?s NPhead), and in the
second one the modifier is syntactically marked by
the preposition of and follows the head noun (of-
genitive, i.e. NPhead of NPmodif ).
Although the genitive constructions have been
studied for a long time in cognitive linguistics, their
semantic investigation proved to be very difficult, as
891
the meanings of the two constructions are difficult to
pin down. There are many factors that contribute to
the genitives? semantic behavior, such as the type of
the genitive, the semantics of the constituent nouns,
the surrounding context, and others.
A characteristic of genitives is that they are very
productive, as the construction can be given various
semantic interpretations. However, in some situa-
tions, the number of interpretations can be reduced
by employing world knowledge. Consider the ex-
amples, ?Mary?s book? and ?Shakespeare?s book?.
?Mary?s book? can mean the book Mary owns, the
book Mary wrote, the book Mary is reading, or the
book Mary is very fond of. Each of these interpre-
tations is possible in the right context. In ?Shake-
speare?s book?, however, the preferred interpreta-
tion, provided by a world knowledge dictionary, is
the book written by Shakespeare.
1.3 Previous Work
There has been much interest recently on the discov-
ery of semantic relations from open-text using sym-
bolic and statistical techniques. This includes the
seminal paper of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), Sense-
val 3 and coNLL competitions on automatic labeling
of semantic roles detection of noun compound se-
mantics (Lapata, 2000), (Rosario and Hearst, 2001)
and many others. However, not much work has
been done to automatically interpret the genitive
constructions.
In 1999, Berland and Charniak (Berland and
Charniak, 1999) applied statistical methods on a
very large corpus to find PART-WHOLE relations.
Following Hearst?s method for the automatic ac-
quisition of hypernymy relations (Hearst, 1998),
they used the genitive construction to detect PART-
WHOLE relations based on a list of six seeds repre-
senting whole objects, (i.e. book, building, car, hos-
pital, plant, and school). Their system?s output was
an ordered list of possible parts according to some
statistical metrics (Dunning?s log-likelihood metric
and Johnson?s significant-difference metric). They
presented the results for two specific patterns (?NN?s
NN? and ?NN of DT NN?). The accuracy obtained
for the first 50 parts was 55% and for the first 20
parts was 70%.
In 2003, Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan (Girju,
Badulescu, and Moldovan, 2003) detected the PART-
WHOLE relations for some of the most frequent
patterns (including the genitives) using the Itera-
tive Semantic Specialization, a learning model that
searches for constraints in the WordNet noun hierar-
chies. They obtained an f-measure of 93.62% for s-
genitives and 91.12% for of-genitives for the PART-
WHOLE relation.
Given the importance of the semantic relations en-
coded by the genitive, the disambiguation of these
relations has long been studied in cognitive linguis-
tics (Nikiforidou, 1991), (Barker, 1995), (Taylor,
1996), (Vikner and Jensen, 1999), (Stefanowitsch,
2001), and others.
2 Genitives? Corpus Analysis
2.1 The Data
In order to provide a general model of the genitives,
we analyzed the syntactic and semantic behavior of
both constructions on a large corpus of examples se-
lected randomly from an open domain text collec-
tion, LA Times articles from TREC-9. This analy-
sis is justified by our desire to answer the following
questions: ?What are the semantic relations encoded
by the genitives?? and ?What is their distribution on
a large corpus??
A set of 20,000 sentences were randomly selected
from the LA Times collection. In these 20,000 sen-
tences, there were 3,255 genitive instances (2,249
of-constructions and 1,006 s-constructions). From
these, 80% were used for training and 20% for test-
ing.
Each genitive instance was tagged with the cor-
responding semantic relations by two annotators,
based on a list of 35 most frequently used semantic
relations proposed by (Moldovan et al, 2004) and
shown in Table 1. The genitives? noun components
were manually disambiguated with the correspond-
ing WordNet 2.0 senses or the named entities if they
are not in WordNet (e.g. names of persons, names
of locations, etc).
2.2 Inter-annotator Agreement
The annotators, two graduate students in Computa-
tional Semantics, were given the genitives and the
sentences in which they occurred. Whenever the an-
notators found an example encoding a semantic re-
lation other than those provided, they had to tag it
as ?OTHER?. Besides the type of relation, the an-
892
notators were asked to provide the correct WordNet
2.0 senses of the two nouns and information about
the order of the modifier and the head nouns in the
genitive construction. For example, although in of-
constructions the head is followed by the modifier
most of the time, this is not always true. For in-
stance, in ?owner of car[POSSESSION]? the head
owner is followed by the modifier car, while in
?John?s car[POSSESSION/R]? the order is reversed.
Approximately one third of the training examples
had the nouns in reverse order.
Most of the time, one genitive instance was tagged
with one semantic relation, but there were also sit-
uations in which an example could belong to more
than one relation in the same context. For example,
the genitive ?city of USA? was tagged as a PART-
WHOLE relation and as a LOCATION relation. There
were 21 such cases in the training corpus.
The judges? agreement was measured using the
Kappa statistics (Siegel and Castelan, 1988), one
of the most frequently used measure of inter-
annotator agreement for classification tasks: K =
Pr(A)?Pr(E)
1?Pr(E) , where Pr(A) is the proportion of
times the raters agree and Pr(E) is the probability
of agreement by chance.
The K coefficient is 1 if there is a total agreement
among the annotators, and 0 if there is no agreement
other than that expected to occur by chance.
On average, the K coefficient is close to 0.82 for
both of and s-genitives, showing a good level of
agreement for the training and testing data on the
set of 35 relations, taking into consideration the task
difficulty. This can be explained by the instructions
the annotators received prior to annotation and by
their expertise in lexical semantics.
2.3 Distribution of Semantic Relations
Table 1 shows the distribution of the semantic rela-
tions in the annotated corpus.
In the case of of-genitives, there were 19 relations
found from the total of 35 relations considered. The
most frequently occurring relations were POSSES-
SION, KINSHIP, PROPERTY, PART-WHOLE, LOCA-
TION, SOURCE, THEME, and MEASURE.
There were other relations (107 for of-genitives)
that do not belong to the predefined list of 35 rela-
tions, such as ?state of emergency?. These examples
were clustered in different undefined subsets based

on their semantics. The largest subsets did not cover
more than 3% of the OTHER set of examples. This
observation shows that the set of 35 semantic rela-
tions from Table 1 is representative for genitives.
Table 1 also shows the semantic preferences of
each genitive form. For example, POSSESSION,
KINSHIP, and some kinds of PART-WHOLE relations
are most of the time encoded by the s-genitive, while
some specific PART-WHOLE relations, such as ?dress
of silk? and ?array of flowers?, cannot be encoded
but only by the of-genitive. This simple analysis
leads to the important conclusion that the two con-
structions must be treated separately as their seman-
tic content is different. This observation is also con-
sistent with other recent work in linguistics on the
grammatical variation of the English genitives (Ste-
fanowitsch, 2001).
3 The Model
3.1 Problem Formulation
Given a genitive, the goal is to develop a procedure
for the automatic labeling of the semantic relation
it conveys. The semantic relation derives from the
893
semantics of the noun phrases participating in geni-
tives as well as the surrounding context.
Semantic classification of syntactic patterns in
general can be formulated as a learning problem.
This is a multi-class classification problem since the
output can be one of the semantic relations in the set.
We cast this as a supervised learning problem where
input/ output pairs are available as training data.
An important first step is to map the characteris-
tics of each genitive construction into a feature vec-
tor. Let?s define with xi the feature vector of an in-
stance i and let X be the space of all instances; i.e.
xi ? X . The multi-class classification is performed
by a function that maps the feature space X into a
semantic space S
F : X ? S, where S is the set of semantic rela-
tions from Table 1, i.e. rk ? S.
Let T be the training set of examples or instances
T = (x1r1,x2r2, ...,xnrn) ? (X ? S)n where n is
the number of examples x each accompanied by its
semantic relation label r. The problem is to decide
which semantic relation r to assign to a new, unseen
example xn+1. In order to classify a given set of
examples (members of X), one needs some kind of
measure of the similarity (or the difference) between
any two given members of X .
3.2 Feature Space
An essential aspect of our approach below is the
word sense disambiguation (WSD) of the noun. Us-
ing a state-of-the-art open-text WSD system with
70% accuracy for nouns (Novischi et al, 2004), each
word is mapped into its corresponding WordNet 2.0
sense. The disambiguation process takes into ac-
count surrounding words, and it is through this pro-
cess that context gets to play a role in labeling the
genitives? semantics.
So far, we have identified and experimented with
the following NP features:
1. Semantic class of head noun specifies the Word-
Net sense (synset) of the head noun and implic-
itly points to all its hypernyms. It is extracted au-
tomatically via a word sense disambiguation mod-
ule. The genitive semantics is influenced heavily by
the meaning of the noun constituents. For exam-
ple: ?child?s mother? is a KINSHIP relation where
as ?child?s toy? is a POSSESSION relation.
2. Semantic class of modifier noun specifies the
WordNet synset of the modifier noun. The follow-
ing examples show that the semantic of a genitive
is also influenced by the semantic of the modifier
noun; ?Mary?s apartment? is a POSSESSION rela-
tion, and ?apartment of New York? is a LOCATION
relation.
The positive and negative genitive examples of the
training corpus are pairs of concepts of the format:
<modifier semclass#WNsense;
head semclass#WNsense; target>,
where target is a set of at least one of the 36 se-
mantic relations. The modifier semclass and
head semclass concepts are WordNet semantic
classes tagged with their corresponding WordNet
senses.
3.3 Semantic Scattering Learning Model
For every pair of <modifier - head> noun genitives,
let us define with fmi and fhj the WordNet 2.0 senses
of the modifier and head respectively. For conve-
nience we replace the tuple < fmi , fhj > with fij .
The Semantic Scattering Model is based on the fol-
lowing observations:
Observation 1. fmi and fhj can be regarded as nodes
on some paths that link the senses of the most spe-
cific noun concepts with the top of the noun hierar-
chies.
Observation 2. The closer the pair of noun senses
fij is to the bottom of noun hierarchies the fewer the
semantic relations associated with it; the more gen-
eral fij is the more semantic relations.
The probability of a semantic relation r given fea-
ture pair fij
P (r|fij) =
n(r, fij)
n(fij)
, (1)
is defined as the ratio between the number of occur-
rences of a relation r in the presence of feature pair
fij over the number of occurrences of feature pair
fij in the corpus. The most probable relation r? is
r? = argmaxr?RP (r|fij) (2)
From the training corpus, one can measure the quan-
tities n(r, fij) and n(fij). Depending on the level of
abstraction of fij two cases are possible:
Case 1. The feature pair fij is specific enough such
that there is only one semantic relation r for which
894
P (r|fij) = 1 and 0 for all the other semantic rela-
tions.
Case 2. The feature pair fij is general enough such
that there are at least two semantic relations for
which P (r|fij) 6= 0. In this case equation (2) is
used to find the most appropriate r?.
Definition. A boundary G? in the WordNet noun hi-
erarchies is a set of synset pairs such that :
a) for any feature pair on the boundary, denoted
fG?ij ? G?, fG
?
ij maps uniquely into only one rela-
tion r, and
b) for any fuij  fG
?
ij , fuij maps into more than one
relation r, and
c) for any f lij ? fG
?
ij , f lij maps uniquely into a se-
mantic relation r. Here relations  and ? mean ?se-
mantically more general? and ?semantically more
specific? respectively. This is illustrated in Figure
1.
Observation 3. We have noticed that there are more
concept pairs under the boundary G? than above, i.e.
| {f lij} || {fuij} |.

mantic scattering?.
3.4 Boundary Detection Algorithm
An approximation to boundary G? is found using
the training set through an iterative process called
semantic scattering. We start with the most general
boundary corresponding to the nine noun WordNet
hierarchies and then specialize it based on the train-
ing data until a good approximation is reached.
Step 1. Create an initial boundary
The initial boundary denoted G1 is formed
from combinations of the nine WordNet hierar-
chies: abstraction#6, act#2, entity#1, event#1,
group#1, possession#2, phenomenon#1, psycholog-
ical feature#1, state#4. To each training exam-
ple a corresponding feature fij =< fmi , fhj >
is first determined, after which is replaced with
the most general corresponding feature consisting
of top WordNet hierarchy concepts denoted with
f1ij . For instance, to the example ?apartment of the
woman? it corresponds the general feature entity#1-
entity#1 and POSSESSION relation, to ?husband of
the woman? it corresponds entity#1-entity#1 and
KINSHIP relation, and to ?hand of the woman? it
corresponds entity#1-entity#1 and PART-WHOLE re-
lation. At this high level G1, to each feature pair f 1ij
it corresponds a number of semantic relations. For
each feature, one can determine the most probable
relation using equation (2). For instance, to feature
entity#1-entity#1 there correspond 13 relations and
the most probable one is the PART-WHOLE relation
as indicated by Table 2.
Step 2. Specialize the boundary
2.1 Constructing a lower boundary
This step consists of specializing the semantic
classes of the ambiguous features. A feature f kij
on boundary Gk is ambiguous if it corresponds to
more then one relation and its most relevant rela-
tion has a conditional probability less then 0.9. To
eliminate non-important specializations, we special-
ize only the ambiguous classes that occurs in more
than 1% of the training examples.
The specialization procedure consists of first
identifying features f kij to which correspond more
than one semantic relation, then replace these fea-
tures with their hyponyms synsets. Thus one fea-
ture breaks into several new specialized features.
The net effect is that the semantic relations that
were attached to f kij will be ?scattered? across the
new specialized features. This process continues till
each feature will have only one semantic relation at-
tached. Each iteration creates a new boundary, as
shown in Figure 1. Table 3 shows statistics of se-
mantic features f kij for each level of specialization
Gk. Note the average number of relations per fea-
ture decreasing asymptotically to 1 as k increases.

The new boundary is more specific then the previ-
ous boundary and it is closer to the ideal boundary.
However, we do not know how well it behaves on
unseen examples and we are looking for a boundary
that classifies with a high accuracy the unseen exam-
ples. We test the boundary on unseen examples. For
that we used 10% of the annotated examples (differ-
ent from the 10% of the examples used for testing)
and compute the accuracy (f-measure) of the new
boundary on them.
If the accuracy is larger than the previous bound-
ary?s accuracy, we are converging toward the best
approximation of the boundary and thus we should
repeat Step 2 for the new boundary.
If the accuracy is lower than the previous bound-
ary?s accuracy, the new boundary is too specific and
the previous boundary is a better approximation of
the ideal boundary.
For the automatic detection of the semantic re-
lations encoded by genitives, the boundary con-
structed by the Semantic Scattering model is more
apppropriate than a ?tree cut?, like the ones used for
verb disambiguation (McCarthy, 1997) (Li and Abe,
1998) and constructed using the Minimum Descrip-
tion Length model (Rissanen, 1978). The develope-
ment of a ?tree cut? model for the detection of the
semantic relations encoded by genitives involves the
construction of a different ?tree cut? for each head
noun and threfore the usage of these cuts is restricted
to those head nouns. On the other hand, Semantic
Scattering constructs only one boundary that, unlike
the ?tree cut? model, is general enough to classify
any genitive construction, including the ones with
constituents unseen during training.
4 Semantic Relations Classification
Algorithm
The ideal boundary G? is used for classifying the
semantic relations encoded by genitives. The algo-
rithm consists of:
Step 1. Process the sentence. Perform Word Sense
Disambiguation and syntactic parsing of the sen-
tence containing the genitive.
Step 2. Identify the head and modifier noun con-
cepts.
Step 3. Identify the feature pair. Using the results
from WSD and WordNet noun hierarchies, map the
head and modifier concepts into the corresponding
classes from the boundary and identify a feature pair
fij that has the closest euclidean distance to the two
classes.
Step 4. Find the semantic relation. Using the feature
fij , determine the semantic relation that corresponds
to that feature on the boundary. If there is no such
relation, mark it as OTHER.
5 Results
For testing, we considered 20% of the annotated ex-
amples. We used half of the examples for detecting
the boundary G? and half for testing the system.

Table 4: Overall results for the semantic interpretation of genitives
specializations on the WordNet IS-A noun hierar-
chies in order to eliminate the ambiguities of the
training examples. Boundary G1 corresponds to the
semantic classes of the nine WordNet noun hier-
archies and boundaries G2 and G3 to their subse-
quent immediate hyponyms. For both s-genitives
and of-genitives, boundary G2 was more accurate
then boundary G1 and therefore we repeated Step
2. However, boundary G3 was less accurate then
boundary G2 and thus boundary G2 is the best ap-
proximation of the ideal boundary.
Semantic Relations Classification
Table 4 shows the results obtained when classify-
ing the 36 relations (the 36th relation being OTHER)
for of-genitives and s-genitives. The results are pre-
sented for the Semantic Scattering system that uses
G2 as the best approximation of the G? together with
two baselines. Baseline1 system obtained the re-
sults without any word sense disambiguation (WSD)
feature, i.e. using only the default sense number 1
for the concept pairs, and without any specializa-
tion. Baseline2 system applied two iterations of the
boundary detection algorithm but without any word
sense disambiguation.
Overall, the Semantic Scattering System achieves
an 81.82% precision and 77.88% recall for of-
genitives and an 83.53% precision and 73.96% re-
call for s-genitives.
Both the WSD and the specialization are impor-
tant for our system as indicated by the Baseline
systems performance. The impact of specializa-
tion on the f-measure (Baseline2 minus Baseline1) is
10.55% for of-genitives and 14.47% for s-genitives,
while the impact of WSD (final result minus Base-
line2) is 14% for of-genitives and 45.11% for s-
genitives.
Error Analysis
An important way of improving the performance of
a system is to perform a detailed error analysis of the
results. We have analyzed the various error sources
encountered in our experiments and summarized the
results in Table 5.

The reason for the superior performance of Se-
mantic Scattering is because the classification
of genitives is feature poor relying only on the
semantics of the noun components, and the other
897
three models normally work better with a larger set
of features.

7 Discussion and Conclusions
The classification of genitives is an example of a
learning problem where a tailored model outper-
forms other generally applicable models.
This paper presents a model for the semantic clas-
sification of genitives. A set of 35 semantic relations
was identified, and we provided statistical evidence
that when it comes to genitives, some relations are
more frequent than others, while some are absent.
The model relies on the semantic classes of noun
constituents. The algorithm was trained and tested
on 20,000 sentences containing 2,249 of-genitives
and 1006 s-genitives and achieved an average preci-
sion of 82%, a recall of 76%, and an f-measure of
79%. For comparison, we ran a C5.0 learning sys-
tem on the same corpus and obtained 40.60% accu-
racy for of-genitives and 47% for s-genitives. A sim-
ilar experiment with a Naive Bayes learning system
led to 42.31% accuracy for of-genitives and 43.7%
for s-genitives. The performance with a Support
Vector Machines learner was the worst, achieving
only a 31.45% accuracy for of-genitives and 23.51%
accuracy for s-genitives. We have also identified the
sources of errors which when addressed may bring
further improvements.
