Abstract 
In this paper we describe the mapping of 
Zaliznjak?s (1977) morphological classes 
into the lexical representation language 
DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996).  On the 
basis of the resulting DATR theory a set of 
fully inflected forms together with their as-
sociated morphosyntax can automatically 
be generated from the electronic version of 
Zaliznjak?s dictionary (Ilola and Mustajoki  
1989). From this data we plan to develop a 
wide-coverage morphosyntactic lemma-
tizer and tagger for Russian. 
 
1 Introduction 
Our goal is to undertake a detailed corpus analysis 
of Russian texts, focusing on the relationship be-
tween morphological ambiguity (syncretism) in 
nouns and adjectives and the comparative fre-
quency of the relevant grammatical categories. For 
this purpose, we will use two corpora, the Uppsala 
corpus (L?nngren 1993, Maier 1994) and a corpus 
of Russian newspaper texts from the late 1990?s, 
for which we require detailed morphosyntactic an-
notation. However, suitably annotated versions of 
these corpora are not yet freely available and cor-
pus analysis tools for Russian in general are 
scarce.1 
We have chosen, therefore, to develop our own 
lemmatization and tagging technology, based on 
the electronic version of Zaliznjak?s (1977) dic-

tionary (Ilola and Mustajoki  1989), combined with 
a more detailed and validated hand-crafted analysis 
of 1500 most frequent noun lexemes (Brown, Cor-
bett, and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett 
and Fraser 1995). In this paper we describe the 
first step in this process: mapping the basic Zalizn-
jak data into a hierarchical lexical database imple-
mented in DATR.  
1.1 The Zaliznjak dictionary 
Zaliznjak (1977) is a reverse dictionary in book 
form, dealing primarily with Russian inflectional 
morphology.  For each of the almost 100,000 lexi-
cal entries, indexes refer the reader to declension 
types and conjugations, together with stress pat-
terns. Other symbols indicate subregularities and 
irregularities. As the dictionary uses such indica-
tors, it gives explicit information about every in-
flectional form and stress. Ilola and Mustajoki 
(1989: 1-5) describe how the material was adapted 
for computer use.  
Zaliznjak's dictionary has been the starting point 
for a number of applications. Anciaux (1991) made 
use of it in the creation of a spell-checker for Rus-
sian, and Pavlova, Pavlov, Sproat, Shih and van 
Santen (1997) used the electronic version to create 
language-specific tables to fit into the modular ar-
chitecture of the Bell Laboratories Text-to-Speech 
system. Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) and 
Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) cre-
ated a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequent 
noun lexemes from Zasorina (1977). The derived 
forms from this inheritance-based lexicon were all 
checked manually against Zaliznjak. The forms are 
represented in a phonological transcription, to-
gether with stress information (Brown, Corbett, 
Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996).  An up-
dated version of this lexicon was used in Brown 
(1998) to compare different morphological theo-
ries.  
1.2 Outline 
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes the general principles of the mapping and 
examples. In Section 3, we discuss the technical 
framework of our approach and the issues and 
problems that arise. In Section 4 we discuss the 
current status of the mapping and principal areas 
for further development including our approach to 
lemmatization and tagging. Section 5 concludes 
the paper. 
2 Mapping Zaliznjak into DATR 
2.1 The overall approach 
In book form, Zaliznjak?s dictionary has two 
parts. The first is a set of tables identifying mor-
phosyntactic classes and defining the realization 
of morphological features with them. The sec-
ond is a listing of lexical entries, each followed 
by an index referring to a table in the first part 
which gives the paradigm for this particular 
type. For example, the word ?????? 'lamp 
shade' is a masculine noun of type 1A and as 
such follows the inflectional pattern of ?????  
?factory? which is given as the example para-
digm for masculine nouns of type 1A. 
 
1A  
? ????? 
nom ????? 
gen ?????? 
dat ?????? 
acc  ????? 
instr ??????? 
Sg 
loc ?????? 
nom ?????? 
gen ??????? 
dat ??????? 
acc ?????? 
instr ???????? 
Pl 
loc ??????? 
 
Table 1. Zaliznjak?s paradigm for masculine inanimate 
nouns of type 1A. 
 
The electronic form contains just the set of lexi-
cal entries (101401 lines, 98729 lexical entries). 
Thus our mapping process has two distinct compo-
nents: 
 
1. manual construction of a DATR representation 
of the morphosyntactic class and realization in-
formation from the printed paradigm tables; 
 
2. automatic construction of the individual lexical 
entries from the electronic dictionary data. 
 
In practice we also introduce a third component, 
interfacing between the morphosyntactic classes 
and the automatic entries. As we discuss below, 
this gives us increased flexibility in the way we 
interpret the Zaliznjak data.  
The information in Zaliznjak's dictionary in-
cludes a fair number of subregular and idiosyn-
cratic cases. The target representation, DATR, is 
specifically designed to support such situations, 
providing concise representation of hierarchically 
organized lexicons containing generalizations and 
exceptions. We have already a formal theoretical 
model of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser 
1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Tim-
berlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies our 
approach. In addition, as we have a frequency 
based resource to check against (Brown, Corbett 
and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and 
Fraser 1995), we are in a good position to check 
the accuracy of our automatic creation of lexical 
entries for the high frequency, least regular cases. 
The same framework can also be used to capture 
generalisations across languages (cf. Cahill and 
Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our 
current goal. 
2.2 The hand-crafted realization         
component 
Zaliznjak does not use the traditional division of 
words into declension types in his dictionary, but 
divides nouns into types according to the last 
grapheme of the stem. (Ilola and Mustajoki 
1989:9) For example, he distinguishes eight types 
for masculine nouns numbered 1 to 8. These mor-
phological types are then further divided according 
to stress. The masculine noun types can occur with 
six different stress patterns indicated by subcatego-
ries A to F. Thus the most basic masculine noun 
classes might be named M 1A, M 3C, etc.  
Special characters are used to further character-
ize the different morphological types. For instance, 
types with an * indicate the presence of a fleeting 
vowel such as in ?????? 'father-in-law (husband?s 
father)' which has the instrumental ???????.  Ani-
macy is indicated in combination with gender, so 
that a class such as MO 1*A is masculine, animate, 
type 1, stress pattern A with a fleeting vowel. 
This information for each lexical entry is used to 
refer to a table at the beginning of the dictionary 
which gives an example of the inflectional forms. 
These tables form the basis of a hand-crafted 
DATR theory in which each type is represented by 
a node in the DATR inheritance hierarchy.  This 
results in a hierarchical structure of noun classes,  
part of which is shown here: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Extract of the DATR hierarchy 
 
In each node, definitions of morphosyntactic reali-
zations specific to that noun class are given. In-
formation that is shared between (or default for) 
classes is inherited from the parent node. A small 
fragment of the theory is provided here:2 
 
NOMINAL: 
   <mor> == "<stem>" "<mor suffix>". 
                                                          
2 The DATR code is slightly simplified for expository purposes.  Note that the 
code is written to reflect Zaliznjak?s system.  The main goal has not been ele-
gance and economy of representation. For theoretically-driven inheritance 
representations of Russian morphology using DATR see Corbett and Fraser 
(1993), Fraser and Corbett (1995),  and Brown (1998). 
 
NOUN: 
    <> == NOMINAL 
    <mor suffix pl dat> == ?? 
    <mor suffix pl instr> == ??? 
    <mor suffix pl loc> == ??. 
 
NOUN_M: 
    <> == NOUN 
    <syn gender> == masculine 
    <syn animacy> == inanimate. 
 
NOUN_M_1A: 
 <> == NOUN_M  
 <mor suffix sg nom> == Null 
 <mor suffix sg gen> == ? 
 <mor suffix sg dat> == ? 
 <mor suffix sg acc> ==  
"<mor suffix sg nom>" 
 <mor suffix sg instr> == ?? 
 <mor suffix sg loc> == ? 
 <mor suffix pl nom> == ? 
 <mor suffix pl gen> == ?? 
 <mor suffix pl acc> ==  
"<mor suffix pl nom>". 
 
Here, NOMINAL defines the morphotactics of Rus-
sian nominals (nouns and adjectives), comprising a 
stem followed by a suffix that realizes the morpho-
logical features. NOUN inherits this definition and 
defines three plural suffixes that are generally 
shared between nouns, NOUN_M adds specific syn-
tactic features and finally NOUN_M_1A fills out the 
rest of the possible suffixes. Notice that <stem> 
is not defined in this theory ? it will be determined 
on a per-lexical entry basis from the automatically 
generated entries described below. Notice also the 
syncretic definitions for suffixes associated with 
sg acc and pl acc in terms of their nominative 
counterparts for inanimate nouns ? for a more de-
tailed discussion of the techniques used for repre-
senting such a syncretism, see Corbett and Fraser 
(1993:131) and Brown (1998:154-155). 
Classes of feminine and neuter nouns are han-
dled similarly; for feminine nouns, eight types and 
nine different stress patterns are identified, 
whereas for neuter nouns eight types and six stress 
patterns are distinguished. In addition, most of 
these types are found with both animate and in-
animate nouns, and in the DATR theory, two noun 
classes are distinguished for each type occurring 
with both animate and inanimate nouns. In total 
NOMINAL 
NOUN 
NOUN_M NOUN_MO NOUN_F .  .  . 
 NOUN_M_1A 
about 100 different noun classes are distinguished 
per gender in the DATR theory. 
In order to make use of this theory, a lexical en-
try needs to inherit from the node representing its 
noun class and provide the specific morphotactic 
elements associated with the class. So for example, 
a possible definition for ?????? 'lamp shade' 
might be: 
 
??????: 
<> == NOUN_M_1A 
<stem> == ??????. 
 
From this definition, plus the preceding example 
fragment, the standard inference rules of DATR 
allow all the relevant inflectional forms to be de-
rived: 
 
??????: 
<mor sg nom> = ?????? 
 <mor sg gen> = ?????? ? 
 <mor sg dat> = ?????? ? 
 <mor sg acc> = ?????? 
 <mor sg instr> = ?????? ?? 
 <mor sg loc> = ?????? ? 
 <mor pl nom> = ?????? ? 
 <mor pl gen> = ?????? ?? 
<mor pl dat> = ?????? ?? 
    <mor pl acc> = ?????? ? 
<mor pl instr> = ?????? ??? 
<mor pl loc> = ?????? ??. 
 
Note that stress is not currently indicated in the 
derived forms. Our research involves the morpho-
syntactic analysis of written text which generally 
does not mark stress. However, as the distinctions 
related to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977) 
have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress pat-
terns can easily be used in our analysis of syncre-
tism and frequency. 
2.3 Automatic generation of lexical en-
tries 
In its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents each 
lexical entry as a text string of the sort given here 
for the word ?????? 'lamp shade': 
 
??????    0101 ????<?? ? 1? 
 
Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation form 
of the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01 
of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated with 
stress information, the fourth is gender/animacy 
information and the fifth morphological type. 
However, inevitably, many of the entries are 
more complex than this in various ways: 
 
1. Entries can spread over several lines, 
requiring textual concatenation of just the 
parts following the line identifier informa-
tion to build the complete entry. 
2. Where inflectional class does not corre-
spond to gender/animacy, it may be speci-
fied separately between angle brackets. For 
example, ??????? ?? <?? 3*?> 
?grandfather? is a masculine noun which 
declines as a feminine noun of type 3*A. 
 
3. Alternative values for stress patterns and 
sometimes classes may be present between 
square brackets. 
4. Additional annotations indicate second 
locative, second genitive, pluralia tantum, 
irregular forms, etc. 
5. Additional comments may be present en-
closed in parentheses. 
6. Other punctuation (commas etc.) may or 
may not be present. 
In order to deliver lexical entry information in the 
form required by the hand-crafted theory, this data 
needs to be parsed and interpreted into the kind of 
format we saw above. A standard approach to this 
task is to use regular expression search and substi-
tute commands to incrementally rewrite the data 
strings into a more uniform format and ultimately 
into the required input. However, DATR itself also 
provides powerful string-rewriting functionality, 
particularly suited for dealing with awkward ex-
ceptional cases, but less efficient for more routine 
rewriting.  
The approach we have taken strikes a balance 
between these two technologies. Initially we use 
regular expression rewriting to achieve a basic 
parse of the input data: joining multiple lines to-
gether, removing duplicate spaces, isolating vari-
ous bracketed expressions, parsing the remaining 
fields and finally mapping into a DATR definition 
for each entry. However this DATR definition is 
very surface-oriented ? little more than a basic 
segmentation of the input data. This process can be 
carried out completely automatically with a fairly 
high accuracy. But in order to link such entries to 
the core morphological classes, further interpreta-
tion of the data fields identified is necessary, and 
this is achieved dynamically in DATR. 
For example, a typical simple lexical entry is the 
lexeme ???????????? ?female aristocrat?. Its 
entry in Zaliznjak is: 
 
   ???????????? 0101 ????????<???? ?? 3*? 
 
In the first phase of processing, this is mapped via 
regular expression search and substitute into a 
DATR node definition as follows: 
 
Z-????????????: 
    <> == ZALNODE 
    <index> == 30 
    <src txt> == ' ... ' 
    <src cit> == '????????????' 
    <src str> == '????????<????' 
    <src gen> == '??' 
    <src cls> == '3*?'. 
 
This node is an instance of the predefined node 
ZALNODE with index number 30 (meaning simply 
that it was the 30th node to be processed in this 
batch). The <src txt> feature (omitted due to 
lack of space) is the whole original source string, 
and the other features provide the key components 
of the entry (cit ? citation, str ? stressed, gen ? 
gender/animacy, cls ? class). 
This is the ?surface level? representation of the 
lexical entry. The DATR node ZALNODE inter-
prets this information to define implicitly a ?deep? 
representation as required by the morphological 
classes, roughly equivalent to this: 
 
Z-????????????: 
    <> == NOUN_FO_3*A 
    <root_begin> == ?????????? 
    <root_end> == ?. 
 
Here, the gender/animacy and class information 
have been combined (and transliterated to Latin 
script) to determine the declension class for this 
form. The stem forms for this class have been de-
termined from the citation form (the morphotactic 
specification for NOUN_FO_3*A indicates what 
components are required ? different from the sim-
pler NOUN_M_1A case above, to allow for the pos-
sible insertion of a fleeting vowel). 
ZALNODE does not actually create a new node 
definition for the deep representation. Rather, ap-
propriate values for deep features are calculated 
dynamically when the declension class code re-
quests them, by rewriting and transforming the 
values provided by the surface form definitions. 
The overall effect is that, just as we saw previ-
ously, the declension class definitions can use this 
information to provide the syntax and all the in-
flected forms for this word: 
 
Z-????????????: 
   <syn gender> = feminine 
   <syn animacy> = animate 
   <mor sg nom> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor sg gen> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor sg dat> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor sg acc> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor sg instr> = ?????????? ? ?? 
   <mor sg loc> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor pl nom> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor pl gen> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor pl dat> = ?????????? ? ?? 
   <mor pl acc> = ?????????? ? ? 
   <mor pl instr> = ?????????? ? ??? 
   <mor pl loc> = ?????????? ? ??. 
 
For most of these forms the inflection follows the 
value of <root_begin> and <root_end>. 
Notice, however, that in the genitive and accusa-
tive plural forms, a fleeting vowel, ? in this case, is 
inserted between these two components.  
An example of a more complex lexical entry is 
?????? 'soldier' which is a masculine animate 
noun of type 5*A. This noun has a fleeting vowel 
which appears in the nominative singular ?????? 
(phonologically armejec). The writing system also 
indicates the presence of the phoneme /j/ by the 
use of ? in the other case and number combina-
tions. To deal with this allomorphy, the DATR 
node ZALNODE introduces two values for 
<root_begin> in the ?deep? representation of 
this lexical entry, one which is used in the nomina-
tive singular, i.e. ????, and one which is used for 
all other cases, i.e. ?????. The ?deep? representa-
tion for ?????? looks roughly like this: 
 
Z-??????: 
    <> == NOUN_MO_5*A 
    <root_begin 1> == ???? 
<root_begin> == ????? 
    <root_end> == ?. 
3 The technical framework 
The key technical challenge of this exercise was 
actually rather mundane: we needed to find an en-
vironment or set of environments that would allow 
us to do all the processing required (manual edit-
ing, regular expression search and substitute, 
DATR compilation and dumping) with data that 
included both Latin and Cyrillic script. In addition, 
we wanted the resources we created to be maxi-
mally reusable in other contexts, so a solution in 
line with agreed standards was highly desirable. 
To achieve these goals, we adopted Unicode as 
the standard representation for all our data, and 
identified or adapted tools to work with data in that 
form. Furthermore we used the simplest encoding 
of Unicode in data files, the ?ucs2? encoding, 
which stores each 16 bit Unicode character simply 
as two bytes of data. This is not as compact as 
other encodings (such as ?utf8?) but is supported 
by a wider range of applications, in particular Mi-
crosoft Wordpad. 
3.1 A Unicode version of Zaliznjak 
It is a fairly straightforward task to convert the  
transliteration used in the electronic form of Zal-
iznjak to Unicode Cyrillic, using Microsoft Word 
macros. Disambiguation of the hard and soft signs 
is required for the first field, (the index word field), 
as the + character is used for both symbols. How-
ever, the third field differentiates the hard and soft 
sign and, as the number of lexical items written 
with a hard sign is not great, it is a trivial task to 
check these. The resulting files are then saved as 
plain text (ie ?ucs2?) Unicode files. 
3.2 DATR and Unicode 
The DATR compiler used for this project was the 
Sussex/Brighton DATR compiler, which is written 
in Prolog. The DATR compiler inherits its charac-
ter-level processing from the underlying Prolog 
compiler, so in order to process Unicode DATR it 
was simply necessary to run it in a Prolog system 
capable of handling Unicode, and modify it 
slightly to detect when it was given a Unicode file 
as input. This was achieved using Poplog Prolog,3 
plus a customized version of Sussex/Brighton 
DATR (soon to be released as version 2.10). This 
version also includes new support for batch mode 
processing of DATR theories and a number of 
compiler enhancements for compiling larger 
DATR theories. 
3.3  Editing and search and substitute in 
Unicode 
Unicode files stored in ?ucs2? encoding can be 
conveniently viewed and edited using Microsoft 
Word or Wordpad, the latter being more straight-
forward for the simple text-editing requirements of 
most of the data files involved here. The automatic 
rewriting of Zaliznjak entries required a more so-
phisticated regular expression engine, which we 
obtained by adapting the Poplog editor?s regular 
expression functionality to work with Unicode. 
These functions are particularly powerful in allow-
ing multi-line regular expression matching, so that 
one can match patterns spanning several lines 
(such as Zaliznjak data continuation lines) and re-
write them to a single line. Limited manual editing 
of Unicode using the Poplog editor is also possi-
ble: it can manipulate arbitrary Unicode data, but 
its ability to display non-Latin data is platform de-
pendent, and on our platform (Windows 2000) all 
the Cyrillic characters were displayed as ???. 
4 Current status and future work 
The system described in this paper is still very 
much work-in-progress. The core technologies and 
                                                          
3 See http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html. Unicode 
support is only available in version 15.53, although currently it is completely 
undocumented. 
structures of the approach have been developed 
and validated as a viable approach. Population and 
validation of the data is an on-going process, the 
current state of which can be summarized as fol-
lows: 
 
1. The hand-crafted DATR theory for Zalizn-
jak?s morphological classes has been com-
pleted for the noun classes, with adjective 
classes next to be done. Other classes are 
lower priority for the present project. 
2. Automatic compilation of all 98729 
Zanliznjak entries into ?surface? DATR 
nodes is complete but not validated. 
3. Processing of a sample set containing 2062 
entries has been undertaken with the 
following (not fully validated) results: 
 
No. of Zaliznjak entries 2062 100% 
No. of DATR nodes  2000 97% 
Nodes identified as nouns 1192 60% 
Nouns  successfully classi-
fied 
1066 89% 
 
Principal areas for further development include: 
 
1. Completion and validation of noun entries 
2. Extension to adjectives (and possibly 
verbs) 
3. Integration of data from the manually vali-
dated lexicon of 1500 most frequent 
nouns, to improve accuracy, particular for 
irregular forms. 
4. Development of a lemmatizer and tagger 
for Russian using this data. 
 
The last point here deserves further expansion. As 
we discussed in the introduction, the DATR encod-
ing of Zaliznjak is in part the first step towards 
lemmatization and tagging technology for Russian. 
We distinguish lemmatization, that is identifying 
all possible lemmas (plus morphosyntactic fea-
tures) for a word, which can be carried out on the 
word in isolation, from tagging, that is, identifying 
the most likely lemma (plus features) for a word in 
context. The primary aim of the project of which 
this work is a part is to explore ambiguity in lem-
matization and its relationship to frequency. For 
this a high quality lemmatizer is essential.  
In principle, once we have a complete set of in-
flected forms, we could automatically compile it 
into a lemmatizer. However such a lemmatizer 
would be extremely cumbersome to produce and 
use, contain much redundancy and be quite inca-
pable of coping with unknown forms. The ap-
proach we intend to take will exploit the hand-
crafted components of the framework to the full, 
using them to construct recognisers for suffixes 
(and for verbs, prefixes) and identify potential 
roots, and then using the full lexicon to filter and 
validate the resulting candidate analyses (we ex-
pect the recognition process to overgenerate solu-
tions). This will be more compact, probably faster, 
and able to cope with unknown root forms. 
Beyond such a lemmatizer, we are currently in-
vestigating how to combine inheritance-based lexi-
cal representation with traditional part-of-speech 
tagging technology, and hope to apply this work to 
the Zaliznjak data, to deliver a high quality de-
tailed morphosyntactic tagger for Russian texts. 
On the more technological front, current plans 
include: 
 
1. Consolidating Unicode support in DATR 
(extending to the Sicstus Prolog version, 
supporting other file encodings). 
2. Packaging key technologies for wider use. 
3. Delivering the whole Zaliznjak lexicon as 
an XML-based DATR database. 
 
5 Conclusions 
Zaliznjak?s dictionary, both in its book form and 
electronic version, has proved an invaluable tool. 
In this paper we have shown how the classes from 
Zaliznjak can be mapped into a DATR representa-
tion. This representation is a structured lexicon 
from which we can derive all of the associated 
forms for the entries in Zaliznjak. As well as con-
stituting a valuable computation resource for Rus-
sian in its own right, our next step will be to use 
this lexical database as the foundation for high 
quality lemmatization and morphosyntactic tag-
ging software for Russian text.
