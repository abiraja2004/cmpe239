INTRODUCTION 
S ince  t h e  early days of e l e c t r o n i c  computing, two kinds of 
a s s o c i a t i o n s  have existed between computers and d i c t i o n a r i e s  : 
either the computer uses, for various purposes, a stored 
dic t ionary  of some sort (lexicon, vocabulary, glossary, 
thesaurus) or the compuker is employed for constructing and 
analyzing a dic t ionary .  The latter a c t i v i t y  was given a s t r o n g  
impetus in the late 1950's by the formation o f t h e c e n t r e  
dlEtudes du Vocabulaire Francais and its publ icat ion,  the 
Cahiers de Lexicologie. Thus lexicography was among the first 
ncn-mathematical disciplines to make use of the symbol 
manipulating capabil ity of computers. 
While formal theories of syntax have been $uccessful in 
describing the  rules of gramnatical accepeability of natural 
language utterances, the study of meaning, usual ly  c a l l e d  
semantics, has not yet produced a theory of the semantic 
structure of languages, based on observation and analys i s .  It is 
beyond the scope af  t h i s  paper to d i s c u s s ,  even superf ic ia l ly ,  
the various viewpoints concerned w i t h  the concept of meaning. 
One of us, V i i l  (19741, has ,  however, compiled a reasonably 
exhaustive crit ical  survey of the relevant l i t e ra tu re .  
For the purposes of this work, it suffi-ces to present the 
following categories of meaning, as set out by Longyear (19.71)-; 
1 .  Logical meaning applies to such attempts to deal with 
meaning as symbolic log ic  and mathematics. The meanings with 
which the s i g n a l s  of such systems correlate are unique 
outside-world referents or unique meanings w i t h i n  the logical 
system that  eventual ly  have outside-world referents. 
2. General-sernant'4c meanings are a l so  uniqne in their 
reference to outside world, but the semanticists are less 
s t r i n g e n t  i n  scope than the logicians.  Nevertheless, t h e i r  
scope is an i d e a l i z e d  language, much more l i m i t e d  than 
ordinary language. 
3. Communication-theory meaning is equivalent to t he  amount 
of information that  can be transmitted per u n i t  time in a 
comunication .system. 
4 .  Lexicoqraphical meaning is tha t  of "words, " and the 
I outside-world reference is what w e  o r d i n a r i l y  c a l l  meaning. 11 
5. Psycholoqical meaning has so great a scope that  the par& 
involving ordinary language becomes nearly t r i v i  a1 . It 
encompasses overt or covert behavior of any organism as 
responses to s t imul i .  
6. Word-mind meaning h$q the scope equivalent to t h a t  of 
ordinary language. The "words " here are l i n g u i s t i c  
structures, but the "meanings" are ideas ,  mental states, and 
conceptual c a t e g o r i e s .  To o r d i n a r y  meanings ( i n  t h e  l ex ica l  
s e n s e )  here co r r e spond  signals by which mental  s t a t e s  are  
a s c e r t a i n e d .  
7. L i n q u i s t i c  meaning refers to s i g n a l s  as the p i e c e s  o u t  
of  which language i s  made, i.e. m i c r o l i n g u i s  t i c ,  
p h ~ n o l o g i c a l ,  and s y n t a c t i c  s i g n a l s .  
In the framework .of o u r  particular topic w e  shall be mainly 
concerned w i t h  categories 4 and 7 .  
According t o  Weinreich (1 966 ) , u n i l i n g u a l  d e f l n i n g  
d i c t i o n a r i e s  appear t o  be based on a model that assumes a 
d i s t i n c t i o n  between meaning p rope r  ( s i g n i f i c a t i o n ,  comprehension, 
i n t e n s i o n )  and t h e  t h i n g  meant by a s i g n  ( d e n o t a t i o n ,  reference, 
e x t e n s i o n )  . On the basis of what is meant by a sign, Osgaod, 
s u c i ,  and Tannenbaum ( 1  95 7 )  distinguish three k i n d s  of meaning. 
1. Pragmatical ( s o c i o l o g i c a l )  meaning : the r e l a t i o n  of 
signs t o  s i t u a t i o n s  and behaviors. 
2 . ( l i n a u i s  t i c )  meaning : the r e l a t i o n  of s i g n s  
t o  other signs. 
3. Semant ica l  meaning: the r e l a t i o n  of signs t o  t h e i r  
s i g n i f i c a t e s  . It is  easy to see that these classes are i n  
correspondence with Longyear ' s  three layers i n  category 7. 
Homing o n t o  o u r  primary t a r g e t ,  w e  may now restrict our 
interests somewhat f u r t h e r  and c o n c e n t r a t e  on t h e  t w o  l a s t  
classes of  meaning, known under v a r i o u s  d e s i g n a t i o n s  bu t ,  b y  t h e  
ma jo r i ty  of writers, d i s t i n g u i s h e d  as s t r u c t u r a l  meaning and 
lexical meaning. 
Mackey (19653 f i n d s  structural meanings i n  ( 1  ) structure 
words, (2 )  i n f l e c t i o n a l  forms,  and (31 types of word o rder .  
Examples of structure words are articles and prepoai t i o n s ,  and 
these, he i n s i s t s ,  a l t hough  o f t e n  called meaningless  o r  empty, 
may have a large number of  meanings. S i m i l a r l y ,  the i n f l e c t i o n a l  
forms, such as t h e  g e n i t i v e  case and p r e s e n t  t e n s e ,  may have a 
number of meanings, and so  may some types of word order. L e x i c a l  
mefinings, on t h e  o t h e r  hand,  refer t o  the meanings of t h e  c o n t e n t  
words, i n  which the d i f f e r e n c e s  i n  meaning are most easily seen.  
I n  R u s s e l l ' s  v i m  (1 967)  the s t r u c t u r e  words, such as " than ,  I& 
"or, " " h o w e ~ e r , "  have meaning o n l y  in a suitable verbal c o n t e x t  
and canno t  s t a n d  alone. The c o n t e n t  words, which he cal ls  object 
words, such as p r o p e r  names, class names of animals, names of 
c o l o r s ,  do not presuppose ~ t h e r  words and can be used i n  
i s o l a t i o n .  Their  meaning is  l e a r n t  by c o n f r o n t a t i o n  with o b j e c t s  
that are what they mean or instances of what they  mean. A s  soon 
as t h e  a s s o c i a t i o n  between an object word and what it means has 
been e s t a b l i s h e d  by the  l e a r n e r ' s  h e a r i n g ,  i f  f r e q u e n t l y  
pronounced i n  the presence  of t h e  o b j e c t ,  t h e  word i s  unders tood 
also i n  the absence of the  o b j e c t .  T h i $  e x p l a n a t i o n ,  of cou r se ,  
excludes words that deno te  abstract  e n t i t i e s ,  w h i c h  a r e  not 
o b j e c t - l i k e  and u s u a l l y  canno t  have a "presence ."  I t  a l s o  d e n i e s  
that  every s t r u c t u r e  word i n h e r e n t l y  d e n o t e s  one or  a f e w  
d e f i n i t e  relationships even i n  i s o l a t i o n .  I f  this were not so,  
one could n o t  unders tand  what k i n d  o f  r e l a t i o n s h i p  it d e s i g n a t e s  
i f  used i n  a c o n t e x t .  
Lyans (1 969) , q u i t e  s e n s i b l y ,  d i s t i n g u i s h e s  between three 
d i f f e r e n t  k inds  of  s t r u c t u r a l ,  o r  grammatf cal meaning. 
1 .  The meaning of g r a m n a t i c a l  items, such as p r p p o s i t i o n s  
and c o n j u n c t i o n s .  
2. The meaning of grammat ica l  f u n c t i o n s ,  such as subject 
and object ,  i .e.  s y n t a c t i c a l  r e l a t i o n s .  
3 The meaning a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  n o t i o n s  such a s  declarat ive ,  
i n t e r r o g a t i v e ,  i m p e r a t i v e ,  i. e. s y n t a c t i c a l  types. 
Ile further r i g h t l y  observes  that grammatical  items belong to  
closed sets, which have a f i x e d ,  small membership, e.g. p e r s o n a l  
pronouns. L e x i c a l  items, on t h e  other hand belong t o  open sets, 
which have an  unrestricted, large memhership, e . g o  nouns 
Moreover, l e x i c a l  items have both l e x i c a l  ( m a t e r i a l )  and 
gramnatical  meaning whereas grammati ca1 items have on ly  
grammatical  meaning. 
In our work, the  distinction between structure words and 
c o n t e n t s  words is e s s e n t i a l .  T h i s  fact is c l e a r l ~  seen in the 
preparation of the dic t i onary  used for our experiments. 
SOME; PROBLEhIS OF LEXICAL HELATEDNESS 
1. Polysemy and Homonymy 
While the problem of meaning is complex in itself, the 
difficulty i n c r e a s e s  by another order of magnitude if one has to 
deal w i t h  words of many n~eanings or different words with 
d i f f e r e n t  meanings thak have i d e n t i c a l  s p e l l i n g s  or 
pronoupc ia t ions .  And the  decision as to whether a given case 
represents one polysemous word or two (or more) homonyms is far 
from being w e l l  de f ined .  
The separation can be based on morphological criteria .  First 
of all, two graphematical ly  i d e n t i c a l  word forms wi th  different 
meanings are regarded a s  homqraphs and separated i f  they display 
a phonematic d i f f e r e n c e  or i f  they belong to different word 
classes. They are also homographs even if they belong to the 
same word class but possess different i n f l e c t i o n  systems. 
otherwise, they represent  the same word. More than one meaning 
of one word const i tutes a case of polysemy. I n  contrast w i t h  
such d i v e r s i f i e d  meanings of one word, we t a l k  about h m ,  in
which case two words have by chance acquired the same e x t e r n a l  
appearance. A d i s t i n c t i o n  between t he  two can on ly  be made, if 
a t  a l l ,  on the basis of the  h i s t o r i c a l  o r i g i n  of the words 
invo lved. Direct, t r a n s f e r r e d  and specialized senses  of a word 
can be l i s t e d  along ope dimension of meaning, dominant and basic 
senses r e p r e s e n t  certain measures along another  dimension. 
Another concept is semantic  d e p l e t i o n ,  i n  which case t h e  word 
occurs i n  scores of expres s ions .  Mere, the verbal or  s i t u a t i o n a l  
context - adds substantially t o  the meaning of the word i n  
question. With polysemy, however, the context  e l i m i n a t e s  those 
senses of the word that do not apply and thereby disambiguates 
t h e  polysemous word. It i s ,  therefore, i m p o r t a n t  from t h e  
l e x i c o g r a p h i c a l  p o i n t  of view t o  d i s t i n g u i s h  between the degrees 
of interaction between the con tex t  and t h e  meaning of ind iv idua l  
(a) i n  case o f  weak i n ?  luence ,  w e  t a l k  a b o u t  autosemant ic  o r  
semantically autonomous words ; 
(b) a s t r o n g  in f luence  performs a disambiguat ion o f  
polysemous o r  homonymous words; 
(c) t h e  c o n t e x t  d e f i n e s  t h e  'meaning of synsemantic or 
semantically deple ted  words. 
Needless to say t h a t  the above, as innumerable other, 
dec is ions  must o f t e n  be based on subjective c r i t e r i a .  F i n a l l y ,  
it could be noted that, i n  e x c e p t i o n a l  cases, even the inmediate 
c o n t e x t  cannot  r e so lve  t h e  ambiguity4 and two o r  more 
i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s  are acceptable. T h i s  phenpenon  is the 
I t  i s  clear even t o  the casual observer t h a t  t o t a l  
i n t e r c h a n g e a b i l i t y  in all contexts, and identity in both 
c o g n i t i v e  and emotive senses, of two lexical units (words, i n  the 
s i m p l e s t  case] are not possible i n  genera l .  The semant ic  
r e l a t i o n s h i r ;  between synonymy is based on and measured by a l e v e l  
of  s i m i l a r i t y .  
Rather than d i s t i n g u i s h i n g  between the "meaning" and the 
"usage" of a word, one should  assume the v i e w  t h a t  the  former i s  
t h e  sum t o t a l  of t h e  p o s s i b i l i t ! i e s  of the la t te r .  This is 
b a s i c a l l y  what j u s t i f i e s  the e x i s t e n c e  of any monolingual (and, 
poss ib ly ,  b i l i n g u a l )  d i c t i o n a r y .  
The entries i n  the d i c t i o n a r i e s  we are concerned with are 
both words (the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  and d e f i n i t i o n  of which units are 
less than c l e a r - c u t )  and mult i -word l e x i c a l  units. The two are 
of the same s t and ing  and function, and they  w i l l  be treated 
i d e n t i c a l l y .  
3. D e f i n i t i o n s  
Definit ion is the most fuhdamental concept  associated with 
d i c t i o n a r i e s .  We s h a l l  be concerned with both classical 
Aris to te l ian  definitions, based on "class" and "characteristics", 
and operat ional  d e f i n i t i o n s  which use sententialw g e n e r a t i v e  
terms. I n  fact, it is o f t e n  d i f f i c u l t  or  impossible t o  separate 
equivalence o r  paraphrase ciefinitions , on one hand, and those  
tha t  are process-oriented reproductions,  on t h e  other, 
In general., *he lexical  meaning can be rendered by four  basic 
instruments and their  various combinations : 
(a) the  lexicpgraphic def in i t ion  enumerates t h e  most 
important features of t h e  lexical  u n i t  being defined, i n  the 
simplest possible terms; 
(b) q u a l i f i e d  synonyms provide a system of semantically most 
related words; 
( c )  exemplification puts  the def ined  u n i t  in functional 
combination with other u n i t s ;  
(d) a gloss is an explanator or descriptive comnent related 
t o  the d i c t i o n a r y  e n t r y ;  it may also skate s i m i l a r i t i e s  t o  
and d i f  firences from other entries.

AsPECrS. OF THE SCIENCE OF DICPIONARY 
1 . General, Concepts 
U a o u g h  definitions abound, a reasonable d i s t i n c t i o n  seems 
to  be to say t h a t  the semantic description of indiv idual  terms, 
the inventory of words is the customary province of Lexicoqraphy 
whereas le&coloqy refers to the study o f  the  lexical material, 
of the recurrent patterns of semantic r e l a t i o n s h i p s ,  and of any 
formal devices, such as phonological and granmatical $ystems, 
that generate the latter. 
T o  construct  a d ic t ionary  of a given size,. one could choose 
the entries on the basis of t he i r  frequency of occurrence or in 
relying on some measure o f  * u t i l i t y  t h a t  is vaguely t i e d  to t h e  
semantic generality of the candidates. N o  s o l u t i o n  i s  perfect or 
even uniformly useful over the whole dictionary. 
Even the arrangement of meanings of a given entry is moot. 
we talk about l o g i c a l ,  historical and empirical orders. (The 
latter starts with the comon and current usage followed by 
obsolete, colloquial, provincial, slang and technical meanings. ) 
We can dif ferenkiate between engyclopedi c and 
linguistic dicstionaries.  
 he latter are primarily concerned with 
the lexical units  of the language and a l l  their l i n g u i s t i c  
properties . The former, on the other hand, give information 
about sane samponent of the extral ihguis  tic world. Our work 
derives its data base from an encyclopedic dict ionary.  It ehould 
be noted t h a t  the highly polysemous nature of the entries in a 
linguistic dictionary would have constituted an addi t iona 1 
complication in this pilot project, which has now been avoided 
without affecting t h e  general validity of the resu Its. 
We propose t o  int roduce the tern lexicometry to designate the, 
di sc ip l ine  which investigates and analyzes  the quanti tat ive  
aspects of dictionaries, t h e  vocabulary of a language and various 
subsets  of the  l a t t e t .  Lexicometry would count, weigh and 
. . 
measure, and express t h e  results in s t a t i s t i c a l  and mathmatical  
terms. Many such studies are widely known. Such is t he  one 
reported by G U ~  raud ( 1  959 : 
The most frequent words are: 
(a) the  shortest, 
b the oldes t ,  
( c )  the morphologically simplest, 
(d) the semanti-caf l y  most extended,  i .e. 
g r e a t e s t  number of meanings. 
possessing t h e  
As to the measure of frequency, 
n the f i r s t  100 words cover 608 of an averagen t e x t ,  
I# 81 t l  tl M I( Q 1000 85% f 
to I a I n m n 4000 9705% 
Thus the remaining X (?)  thousand words cover o n l y  2 .5% of the  
t ex t .  H o w e V e r ,  from an information theoretic p o i n t  of view, 
the first 100 words comprise 30% of the information, 
I n n n w I 1000 50% " 
11 H (I II n n 4000 70% ' 
Consequently, rare words konvey a great deal of information. We 
could say that a frequent word is  most useful  in the aggregate, 
and a rare word in a particular case. 
Other studies in glottochronology mhcern thanselves with the 
rate of change i n  Language and i n  basic vocabulary. Further, 
distribution of the frequencies of occurrence w i t h  or without 
reference to any particular vocabulary has a l s o  been studied. 
Finding r e l a t i o n s  of the above kind is not j u s t  an academic 
exercise to s a t i s f y  the curiosity of a few l i n g u i s t s ,  but these 
relationships may have various practical applications. For 
example, Maas (1972)  asserts that the knowledge of a funct ional  
relation between the length of a t e x t  and the size of  the 
vocabulary used i n  it would be desirable in order to estimate the 
e f f o r t  needed f o r  extension of a machine d ic t ionary  or i n  
comparison of vocabulary contents  of t e x t s  of d i f  ferent l eng ths .  
In the latter case, one can standardize or normalize the t e x t s  
under i n v e s t i g a t i o n  by reducing them t o  a common minimal length 
through computational methods and then compare the resulting 
vocabulary volumes. 
L e t  V be the number of e lements  (words) i n  a text and N the 
I - 
l e n g t h  of the text. Then we surmise, says Maas, a f u n c t i o n a l  
relatiurnship to  exist between N - and V: 
- 
Muller (1964) reported a re la t ion  between V and d such that

lo N 
-3.- = a,or va = N, or, 10q- v 
1 if we s e t  - = k, k V = L J ,  a 
Since the vocabulary of a language, however, is supposed to 
be restricted, so argues Maas, the existence of a l i m i t i n g  value 
is to be postulated: 
V,= lim f (N) 
N+m 
As the derivative of f at a given value of N represents the 
- - 
relative increase in V -1 it is to be s t a t e d  that f' (N) approaches 
0 with i n c r e a s i n g  - N, 
The derivative of a f at the p o i n t  1 is assumed to be 1 because 
a tex t  of l e n g t h  1 has a vocabulary consisting of one word, hence 
Therefore - f' i s  a function that decreases mnotonical ly from 1 to 
As a consequence of the above speculations, in t h e  expression 
V = N~ k cannot be constant. ' -

resulted in the relationship

log E = 0.0137.  ( log N) 1/3

from 
Another noteworthy concept is  that of r e p e t i t i o n  factor : 
which shows how of ten word has occurred in a t e x t  
on the averaqe. 
The following relationship has been determined:

2 ,  The Problem of Coverase 
We are now coming close to the core subject matter of t h i s  
paper. Mackey ( 1965 )  s ta tes  that  
 he coverage or covering capacity of an item is the 
number of t h i n g s  one can say w i t h  it. It can be measured by 
the number of other  items which it can d i s p l a c e .  )I 
According to him, words can displace other words by Eour 
means: (1 ) inc lus ion ,  ( 2 )  extension, ( 3 )  combination, and (4!  
d e f i n i t i o n ,  
1,  A word that  already includes the meaning o f  other  words -
can be used instead of these ( e . g . ,  seat includes chair 
L- - P  
bench, s tool ,  and place) , 
- lLlCI 
2 .  Words the meanings of which are easily extended 
me'kaphorically can be used to eliminate others (e.g., 
tributary of a river can be covered by branch or arm). 
- - 
3 . Certain simple words can displace others by combining 
e i t h e r  together or with simple word endings (em g. , news + 
paper + man = journa l i s t  ; hand + book = manual) . 
4 . Certain words can be replaced by simple d e f i n i t i o n  
( e r g . ,  breakfast can be def ined as morning meal; pony a s  
small horse ) .  
As an example of the app l i ca t ion  of the above principle, in 
the derivation of Basic English (by definition), the  language was 
f irs t  reduced to 7500 words, and, by r e d e f i n i t i o n ,  cut down to 
1500. These were further reduced to  the  eventual  850 by a 
technique of "panoptic" d e f i n i t i o n  (eliminate each word on t h e  
grounds that it is some sort of modification of other  words, e. g. 
a modif icat ion i n  time, numbe-r, or s i z e )  . 
Basic English, which was founded essentially on the p r i n c i p l e  
of cove rage, was a conscious reaction a g a i n s t  the 
over-application of the p r i n c i p l e  of frequency i n  selection. For 
Ogden (1  933) , it was n o t  the frequency of a word which makes i t  
u s e f u l ,  it  was i ts  usefulness which makes it frequent.  
In the following part  of this sect ion,  we attempt to present 
some of the salierit p o i n t s  of Savard (1 970). 
The vocabulary i n d i c e s  most widely known today are those o f  
frequency, of distribution, and of a v a i l a b i l i t y .  But these are 
n o t  s u f f i c i e n t  to select words for a restricted vocabulary for 
the purpose of teaching a fore ign  language, such as Wench, to 
beginners.  
An objective c r i t e r i o n  is l e x i c a l  valence .  I t  would allow 
1 . to obtain a n o v e l  p r i n c i p l e  of vocabulary s e l e c t i o n ,  
2 . t o  assist the i n v e s t i g a t o r s  i n  s e t t i n g  up a base 
vocabulary f o r  French, 
3.  t o  provide a usable  d e f i n i t i o n ,  combination, inclusion, 
and extension vocabulary, 
4 a to  correct a l l  the already e x i s t i n g  scales of French 
vocabulary, 
5. to provide a valid working tool for the analysis of 
teaching material. 
The valence problem is a problem of verbal economy. \that he 
calls va lence  i s  the  fundamental capability o f  a word t o  be 
substituted for another word. It is Mackey's coveraqe t h a t  he 
renders as  valence, 
Like  Mackey ( 1 9 6 5 ) ,  he maintains t h a t  the s u b s t i t u t i o n  of one 
word for another can he made by virtue of four criteria: ( 1 )  
d e f i n i t i o n ,  ( 2 )  i n c l u s i o n ,  ( 3 )  combinatiori, ( 4 )  ex t ens ion .  
~ e f i n i t i o n  has already been discussed previously. 
Linguists do not  t a l k  specifically about inclusion; rather ,  
they d e a l  with synonymy or l e x i c a l  paral le l i sm.  Synonyms are. 
words that have near ly  the  same meaning, e . g .  - lieu and endroi t .  
For Savard, the bas i c  criterion t h a t  permits to establish a 
series of the p o s s i b i l i t y  of s u b s t i t u t i n g  one term 
for  another. 
One of the s i m p l e s t  amng a l l  the procedures of vocabulary 
enrichment consists o f  j o in ing  two words order to make 
compound words. The p r i n c i p l e  0-f combination appears as another 
phenomenon common t~ a l l  langrlages. 
It i s  n o t  necessary that  the number of s imple words be 
unbounded because almost a l l  verbs have a p o t e n t i a l  of 
undetermined sense, and so do the adject ives .  A word is said to 
have more or less extension according to wheaer it  can "cover" a 
more or less great number of f u l l y  or p ~ r t i a l l y  d i f f e r e n t  
notions. 
Polysemy is the exact opposite of synonymy. Polysemy becomes 
complicated d w  to the phenomenon of homonymy. Polysemy and 
homonymy constitute two very r i ch  sources of l ex i ca l  economy. 
Togethel: they form Savard' s l a s t  criterion of lexical 
valence--the semantic extension, 
Although the valence i t se l f  has rfever been mathematically 
measured and although there exis- no sc i en t i f i c  means of showing 
its existence, it has neverthe less, been proven that four formal 
proceaures of lexical economy permt to replace certain words by 
other words, and that  is what S a v ~ d  cal ls  l e x i c a l  valence. 
The postulated existence hypothesis of lexical valence leads 
to the c a l c u l a t i o n  of a global index of valence for e k d r y  word. 
To evaluate t h e  power of of  a word, one i n s p e c t s ,  
in t h e  dictionary,  each element of the general 139t and counts 
how many times a word enters  into  the definition of another. 
To measure the power of combination of a lexical unit, one 
inspects in the d i c t i o n a r y  all the compound words joined by a 
hyphen, all the Gallicisms ( i n  English, these would be 
Anglicisms) and, in general, a l l  the  word groups. 
W i t h  a view of appra i s ing  the power of i n c l u s i o n ,  one 
inspects me units of the general l i s t  in two synonym 
dictionaries and takes the higher  number. The numbei of synonyms 
tha t  possess a word c o n s t i t u t e s  a measure of the nunber of words 
f o r  which can substituted. 
To measure the power of semant id  e x t e n s i o n ,  one i n s p e c t s  each 
of the e lements  of the general list i n  the d i c t i o n a r y  and c o u n t s  
the number of meanings g iven  by the author t o  such a word in the 
list. T h e  number of meanings of a word is c o n s i d e r e d  as a 
m a s u r e  of i t s  power of semant ic  extension. 
The global index  of lexical valence is t h e  sum of t h e  four 
normalized coun t s .  The two c r i t e d i a  having  t h e  h ighes t  
c o r r e l a t i o n  are d e f i n i t i o n  and combinat ion.  
In the beginning of t h e  study, it was assumed t h a t  thk four 
v a r i a b l e s  were entirely independent  of each other .  The results 
of a f a c t o ~ a n a l y s i s  i n d i c a t e  that they are not  comple te ly  so. A 
factor r o t a t i o n  shows, however , that the  variables are 
s u f f i c i e n t l y  independent  t o  make it necessary t o  retain the four 
cr i t e r i a  of l ex i ca l  valence. 
A comparison of t h e  rank of the first 40 c o n t e n t  words on the 
valence scale w i t h  the same words on t h e  f requency l i s t  allows t o  
frame a hypothesis t h a t  t h e  c o r r e l a t i o n  between va l ence  and 
f requency would be rather weak. A more complete  study would show 
withou t  doubt that:  w e  have there two very different s e l e c t i o n  
p r h c i p l e s .  
I n  conc lus ion ,  i eSan be stated with conf idence  that t h e  
measure of valence i s  no  less v a l i d  t han  that of frequency, 
distribution . and a v a i l a b i l i t y .  These concep t s  w i l l  eventually 
lead to more efficient d i c t i o n a r i e s  with respect to precision, 
compactness and l e x i c a l  economy. 
ON LEXICOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE SIZE OF DEFINING SET, 
TUE: SIZE OF DEFINED SET AND TILE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF DEFINITIONS 
1. Some Measures of Coverage 
A d i c t i ona ry  may be considered efficient and economical i f  it 
u s e s  a reasonably small set of words to d e f i n e  9 r e l a t i v e l y  large 
set of  entries. W e  have, however, a very vague idea about  what 
size vocabulary  is needed t o  cover  a g iven  number of d i c t i o n a r y  
e n t r i e s .  (The related problem of c i ~ c u l a r  d e f i n i t i o n s  seems t o  
have t o  wait for a camputer s o l u t i ~ n . )  
I t  is known, for example, that Basic Eng l i sh ,  Ogden (1 933) , 
involves a l ist  of 850 English words and 50 in ternat ional  words, 
which were e v e n t u a l l y  used t o  de f ine  the 20,000 English words of 
Basic Ynglish D ic t i ona ry .  This gives a rat io  of the number of 
covering. words to that of d e f i n e d  words of 0.045. 
West s tud ied  the problem of what c o n s t i t u t e s  a simple 
definition and e s t a b l i s h e d  a minimum defining vocabulary of 1 , 4  90 
words. The meaning of sane 18,000 words and 6,OQ'u idioms, i.e. 
about 2 4 ,000  expressions, was explained exclusively by these  
1,490 words, which were not def ined themselves. The results were 
published in 1961 as The 14ew Method English Dic t i ona ry  bf H o p m  
West and J. G. E n d i c o t t .  The co r respond ing  size r a t i o  here i s

contains the design of the program fo r  case (b) . 
2 .  Cons t ruc t ion  of the Data Base 
The data base was not  derived from a text but was based on an 
existing d i c t i o n a r y  of computer terminology, Chandor ( 1 9 7 0 )  . A 
derivation from a text, if used, should be automatic and woulcl 
constitute a large-scale programming project in i t s  own rigslt:  
In creating the data base, it was attempted to keep its structure 
simple and uniform without sacrificing its g e n e r a l  validity. I t  
w a s  t r i e d  t o  avoid problems that would introduce d i s t r a c t i n g  
complications, from both theoretical and practical noint of view, 
into the subsgquent operations. All t h i s  led to t h e  selection 
- 30 - 
and construction p r i n c i p l e s  outlined below. 
Terms  w i t h  excessively long definitions were avoided, i.e. 
d e f i n i t i o n s  were held reasonably  short .  It was found that 
lexical units 
limiting bhe maximum d e f i n i t i o n  l e n g t h  to 22,,did not undu lv  d 
res tx ic t  t h e  selection. I n  some cases too long d e f i n i t i o n s  were 
shortened by leaving out redundant words ,  glo lses ,  r nxplanatorv 
notes. 
Every element of the c o v e r e d  set was considered a lexical  
item, regardless of whether t h e  oriqinal d i c t i o n a r y  entry 
consisted o fa one, two, or more vrords. For programing  
convenience every word was coded as a s t r i n g  of no more than  10  
symbols. Thus accumulator was represented as ACUMULATOR, 
absolute address appeared as ABSADDMSS, and 
absolute value computer as ABSIrALCOnIP. 
Polvsemous terms were avoided. 1f such a term was used,  o n l v  
i t s  dominan t  meaning was recorded. In the data-base d i c t i o n a r y ,  
t h e n ,  each entry (element of t h r  covered set) has only one  
meaning and one definition. 
Tefms  used in the definitions (elements of theacopering set) 
were a l s o  c o n s i d e r e d  t% be l e x i c a l  items, i.e. oriqi nal 
multiword terms appear as a s i n g l e  element, and every element is 
represented as a s t r i n g  of no more than 1q  symbols. 
All terms o c c u r r i n g  in t h e  d e f i n i t i o n s  are themselves 
d e f i n e d ,  i.e. each element of th,e covering set appears a lso  in 
t h e  covered set. This p r i n c i p l e  implies t\at there i s  a S e t  of 
words each element  of  which  is d e f i n e d  by itself. Such a sat may 
be called the basic vocabulary ,  consisting of vrords the meanings 
o f  which t h e  user of the d i c t i o n a r y  i s  suprmsed t o  know i n  order  
t o  use t h e  d i c t i ~ n a ~ z y .  As in this particular case, the 
d i c t i o n a r y  is one of computer terms and t h e  hasic voca5nlary 
contains t h e  non techn ica l  words used  in the d e f i n i t i o n s  of the 
t e c h n i c a l  terms. 
I n  t h e  de f in i t ' i ons ,  a d e f i n i t e  d i s t i n c t i o n  was made Sctween 
c o n t e n t  words and f u n c t i o n  words, also called opera tors .  The 
latter were n o t  included i n  t h e  covering s e t  nor were t h e y  
counted i n  de te rmin ing  the definition length. Hence, thcs 
cover ing  set ~ o n s i s t s  o n l y  of c o n t e n t  words. 
The set of f u n c t i o n  words i s  def ined rather broadly.  I't 
contains a wide v a r i e t y  of expressions that do not d i r e c t l y  
contribute a n y t h i n g  to  t he  c o n t e n t  of t h e  d e f i n i t i o n  h u t  on ly

d a t a  base shoved t h a t  t h e  basic v o ~ a h u l a r y  forms a b o u t  0 .55  of 
t h e  e n t i r e  covered se t ,  
We reca l l  t h a t ,  i n  a n t i c i p a t i o n  of this kind of difficulty, 
t h e  f u n c t i o n  words were eliminated from the covering se t ,  t o  
begin wi th .  I f  this had n o t  been  done, t h e  s i t u a t i o n  would have 
been aggravated by an order of magni tude.  To e l i m i n a t e ,  or  a t  
least to alleviate t h i s  b ias ,  a 'Eons ide rah ly  larger data base 
should be used, which, as explained before, would have heen 
beyond t h e  scow - of this p i l o t  project. 
Another, and more important, factor t h a t  c o n t r i b u t e s  t o  t h e  
problem in quest ion is the fact t h a t  o u r  data-hase d i c t i ona ry  was 
n o t  derived from a t e x t  h u t  c o n s t r u c t e d  from another d i c t i o n a r y .  
This was done, as described ea r l i e r ,  by selecting entries 
s t a r t i n g  from t h e  beginning of t h e  dictionary and stopping when 
the data base was of satisfactory size. As a r e s u l t ,  while  t h e  
basic  vocabulary may be assumed to be uniformly distributed over 
t h e  d i c t i o n a r y ,  the important conten t  words, w i t h  lonqer 
d e f i n i t i o n s ,  are no t .  The s e l e c t i o n  of e n t r i e s ,  i n  fact, was 
stopped a t  t h e  l e t t e r  H.  Words beyond t h a t  p o i n t  are there  only 
because t h e y  happened t o  occu r  i n  definitions. Thus,  at least 
t h e  words t h a t  o c c u r  on ly  i n  t h e  covered s e t  (and n o t  i n  t h e  
cover ing  set) are  crowded toward t h e  b e g i n n i n g  of t h e  d i c t i o n a r y .  
What happened when t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  was reduced i s  now obvious .  
The weighty words w i t h  long d e f i n i t i o n s  were e l i m i n a t e d  h u t  t h e  
entire basic v o c a b u l a r y  remained. This, of course, is q u i t e  
appropriate and consistent w i t h  our p r i n c i p l e s .  I f ,  f o r  example, 
the d i c t i a n a r y  had been reduced t o  N = 1 ,  v i r t u a l l y  o n l y  the 
b a s i c  vocabulary would have been retained, and we shou ld  have 
obtained tho postulated linear one-to-one r e l a t i o n s h i p  between vF 
- 
and v  3' Nevertheless, t h i s  procedure  enhances t h e  p r o p o r t i o n  of 
t h e  b a s i c  vocabulary, and t h e  bias i n c r e a s e s .  As the t e c h n i c a l  
words are r e l a t i v e l y  scarce i n  t h e  l a s t  t h i r d  o f  t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  
t o  begin w i t h ,  the s i t u a t i o n  ge t s  worse, with the r e d u c t i o n ,  
toward t h e  end of t h e  dictionary. T h i s  accounts for t h 5  
i n c r e a s i n g  increment ratio. The last increment  w i t h  ?J = 1 6  must 
have consisted entirely of basic words, t h e r e f o r e  the r a t i o  of 
u n i t y .  
It is suggested t h a t ,  for further i n v e s t i q a t i o n ,  a more

be a complicated procedure  and difficult t o  c o n t r o l .  I f  few s u c h  
xeplacements are made, v will not change appreciably. If many R

are made, some replacements tend to reintroduce precilsely t h e  
words o t h e r s  try to eliminate. In any case, the r e su l t  would he  
a set of awkward and unnatural definitions of erratic lengfhs. 
In order t o  use such a procedure, an efficient dicFlonarp should 
f i r s t  be compiled, with short definitions and well controlled 
covering set. The concept of l e x i c a l  valence should he u t i l i z e d ,  
but this entails more research in t h i s  area. It ~vou ld  also gat 
the researcher involved in the problem discussed in t h e  p reced ing

that the routine that computes the data points actually

APPENDIX I 
Proqram Development 
The entire d a t a  base was first punched on cards t o  be 
i n p u t t e d  as a s i n g l e  l i s t  structure, with t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  e n t r i e s  
a l p h a b e t i c a l l y  ordered.  I t  was soon e s t a b l i s h e d  that this 
arrangement by f a r  exceeded run-time storage l imi t - a t ions  (us ing  a 
field l e n g t h  of 100,000, ) . Only ahout one f i f t h  of t h e  m a t e r i a l  
could be accomfnodated a t  one time without exhausting t h e  
available space. Therefore  t h e  dictionary was s p l i t  i n t o  f i v e  
i n d i v i d u a l  List s k r u c t u r e s ,  and t h e  correspofidbng card imaqes 
were stored on disk as f i v e  s e p a r a t e  f - i l e s .  These were brought 
i n ,  one a t  a t ime,  f o r  p rocess ing  ss needed. Recause of space 
l i m i t a t i o n s ,  also processed data and i n t e r m e d i a t e  r e s u l t s  had t o  
"I 
be p u t  i n  e x t e r n a l  s t o r a g e  dur ing  run  t i n e  and,  of course ,  
between runs, t h e r e f o r e  more f i l e s  had t o  he created as de.;crihzd 
l a t e r .  Thus, a g r e a t  d e a l  of programming effort went into f i l e  
manipulat ion.  
The purpose of  t h e  first program, des igna ted  AMALEX, was 
simply t o  d i s p l a y  t he  dictionary. I t  Y i r s t  reads t h e  function 
words from the cards and stores them i n  the form of a 121x2 
array. (The width of the array  is 2 because many function words 
are longer  than 10 c h a r a e t e r s . )  
Using a f u n c t i o n  READLS, the program reads t h e  dictionary and 
s tores  15: in t h e  form of a l i s t  structure as described above. On 
t h i s  occasion, it also measures t h e  space r e q u i r e d  for  the 
dic t ionary .  I t  was found that a field length of more t han  
235,680, locations ~ m u l d  he needed to accommodate the entire data 
base. 
A subroutine ca l l ed  RITELS prints out the d ic t i ona ry ,  
spec i fy ing  each ent ry  by the d e f i n i t i o n  in the form of at most 10 
words to the l i n e .  The rou t ine  also checks t h e  operator code 
numbers in the third'-level sublists and replaces these in t3e 
p r i n t o u t  by the appropriate f u n c t i o n  tmrds from the array. 
The d i c t i ona ry  was pr in ted  out in f o u r  separate rvns as t h e  
d i c t i o n a r y  was initially divided i n t o  fou r  l i s t s .  Since the 
ANALEX program does no f u r t h e r  processing and accumulates no new 
l ists,  no storage problems arose. It was no t  until later t h a t  it 
was established that a d i v i s i o n  into five p a r t s  was necessary t o  
perform subsequent opera t ions  i n  t h e  space - avai lable .  
The  first p r i n t o u t s  were carefully examined for  punching 
errors and omissions. Detected errors ware corrected and the  
f i l e s  were updated accordingly. 
The actuaI working program is named COVSET. If the entire 
data base were one  single l i s t  and if time were ava i lab le  
indefinitelv, A t h i s  pro-gram would do the complete work in a single 
r u n .  In t h i s  case, i t  would print a fable of corresponding v 
and % v a l u e s  for a g iven  v a l u e  of N ,  would r educe  the v a l u e  of 
I
- 
N and p r i n t  o u t  ano the r  table, etch , and repeat t h i s  for a l l  
- 
desired v a l u e s  of N. 
- 
This, of course, could not be done because, i n  the f i r s t  
p l a c e ,  o n l y  one of the f i v e  parts of t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  could h e  
worked on a t  a t i m e  and, i n  thse second p l a c e ,  the program had to 
be run i n  time inc rements  of 600  s or less,  which was the set 
t i m e  l i m i t ,  
The p r i n c i p a l  r o u t i n e  i n  COVSET i s  ca- l led  COVRYG, w h i c h

counting the number of times that a new section of t h e  dictionary 
was brought i n  for processing. A Value !WXW,P was read Ln and 
when the above counter,  s t a r t i ng  from O, reached this va'lue, t h e  
run was interrupted. 
The variables  KNTCVD and KNTCNG are counters for  v and vR ,

to the other.  The value of KNTPRT indicates  t h e  sec t io f i  of t h e

The variable IrtCONT is s e t  to 0 f o r  t'le very f i r s t  run far

Covered L i s t ,  Covering L i s t ,  and a so-called Waiting List. In 
a l l  successive runs its value i s  1 ,  i n d i c a t i n g  t h a t  the program 
must bring these l i s t s  i n  from t h e  external file. 
The r o u t i n e  exmines the current. section of the dictionary, 
entrymby e n t r y .  In the first series of r u n s ,  it deals wi th  one 
o f  t h e  f i v e  sections, stored in one of t h e  f i v e  files, i n  t h e  
form of t h e  o r i g i n a l  card images. A sixth file was created for 
s t o r i n g  a l l  t h e  lists generated by the program. Idhen t h e  
d i c t i ona ry  was later reduced ( for  reduced values of nr , t n e  
C 
corresponalng  s e c t i o n s  of t h e  reduced dictionary were a l so  stored 
in that s i x t h  file. 
I f  t h e  c u r r e n t  entry is  an element of the Sas.ic vocabulary 
(type 2) , the routine bypasses it and takes t h e  next entry. Tflis 
can be dane in t h e  processing of t h e  f u l l  dictionary because all 
these words occur  in t h e  definitions and will cer ta in ly  he caught 
la ter .  T h i s  i s  no longer so in processing the reduced d i c t i o n a r y  
because t h e  words in the definitions of which they occur may have 
been eliminated. I n  t h e  latter case, t h e r e f o r e ,  this tvpe 0.f a 
word i s  immediately added t o  b o t h  t h e  Covered List and the 
Covering L i s t  (it always covers i t se l f )  . 
I f  t h e  current entry i s  a word that does n o t  occur i n  any 
d e f i n i t i o n  (type O ) ,  it is  being encountered t h e  f i r s t t i m e ,  and 
we are sure t h a t  it is  not alteady on the Covered- L i s t ;  hence, 
t h i s  question need not be asked. 
Otherwise the routine tests if the word is already on t h e  
Covered List, which may well he t h e  case hecause the word may 
have occurred earlier in the definition of another word. If so, 
t h e  routine proceeds to t h e  next ward i n  t'le d i c t i o n a r y .  
If t h e  word is not found on the Covered L i s t ,  i t  is p u t  
there, and KNTCVD is incremented. Then a l l  the words in tho 
definition of the word in quest ion are put on t h e  Wait ing List,

The current d ic t ionary  e n t r y  i t se l f .  is recorded as t'le valug 
of the variable  DREF, which passe s  the information on, from one 
run  to the next ,  where in t h e  d ic t ionarv  t h e  program is c u r r e n t l y  
in action.  
The r o u t i n e  then examines the Waiting L i s t ,  word by vord. If 
the current vmrd is already on the Covered L i s t  (it mav have 
Occurred earlier in t h e  dictionarv), the  r o ~ k i n e  c3ecks if it is 
also on t$e Covering L i s t  (it may not he hecause it has n o t  v s t  
occurred in the d e f i n i t i o n  of another swrd)  . If not, it i s  put- 
there, and KNTCNG is incremented. A11 words on the Waiting L i s t  
come from definitions and must therefore he added t o  t h e  C o w r i n g  
L i s t .  After a word has be& processed, it is deleted from t h e  
Waiting L i s t .  
~f the c u r r e n t  ptord is n o t  on the Covered List, it must 
obvious ly  be p u t  sthere. F i r s t ,  however, t h e  routine tests  i f  t h e  
word occurs in t h e  sec t ion  of t h e  d i c t i o n a r v  c u r r e n f l v  i n  s t o r e  
by checking whether i t s  numerical  v a l u e  is between those of t h e

t h e r e ,  t h e  r o u t i n e  postpones i t s  processing and takes t h e  n e x t

Should t h e  word be i n  t h a t  section, t h e  r o u t i n e  adds it t o  
the Covered List, increments KNTCVD, and a c t u a l l y  looks for t h e  
w o r d  i n  the d i c t i o n a r y .  I f  it does nok find it, it gives  an

t h e  run .  T h i s  way t'he remaining punching errors in the d a t n  hase

The f i l e s  were updated accord ing ly .  
If t h e  word i s  found, the r o u t i n e  adds a l l  t h e  words i n  i t s  
d e f i n i t i o n  to t h e  Waiting L i s t ,  t h e n  i n v e s t i g a t e s  i t s  presence on 
the Fovering List, and proceeds as described before. When t h e  
bottom of the Waiting ~ 1 s t  i s  reached and the l i s t  i s  not empty, 
t h e  words remaining on it must be i n  other  s e c t i o n s  of t h e  
d i c t i o n a r y .  The section present is then erased and the next 
sect ion i s  brought i n  (if the c u r r e n t  one is sec t ion  5, sect ion 1 
is read in). The processing - of t h e  Waiting L i s t  now starts from 
t h e  beyinning and continues as described above. 
If the Waiting List is finally empty, and K?ITCVD equals or 
exceeds LSTREF, the r o u t i n e  i nc r emen t s  LSTREF by the prescriber? 
amount, and prints t h e  values of KT!TTCVD and I3VTCTTG. If t h e  couflt 
i s  less than t h e  reference value, the r o u t i n e  simnlv proceg'ds. 
I n  any case, i t  tests if t h e  proper sect ion of t h e  dictipnarv - 
happens to he in the store (it knows t h a t  hv - the value of 
KNTPRT) . If it does no t ,  the section present' is erased a n 3  the 
right sect ion is read in. 
Next t h e  routine looks for the word 3t v11ic5 it had

case i n  which it does n o t  f i n d  t h e  reference for some re~son. 
FortUnately,  t h e  program never made use of t h i s  message. After  
finding the reference, t h e  r o u t i n e  takes the n e x t  v~ord from t h e

convenience) . The control  parameters and reference var iables  are 
p r i n t e d  out,. The data cards are changed a c c o r d i n s l y ,  for i n p u t  
t o  t h e  next run. 
The f i r s t  series of runs was perZomed w i t h  t h o  ell 11

eliminating 1 words containing them in t h e i r  definitions, 
subsequently eliminating all words the definitions of vthic\ 
c o n t a i n  the latter, etc. 
The program ca l l s  another  qajor subroutine, named DICRED,  to 
carry out this operation. The routine is hasicallv simple; what  
makes it appear complicated i s  the manipu la t ion  of t\e files. It 
was found to be most convenient to search one section of the 
d i c t i o n a r y  per run. 
From the data cards, t h e  routi 'ne reads a reference parameter 
called KYTSCT, which indicates the ! lBighcst  consecutive s e c t i o n  
number t h a t  has  been s e u c h e d .  The control  variable I D R P h a s  
valne 0 at input; t h e  r o u t i n e .  changes it to 1 if any w,qrds were 
r e m o v e d  from t h e  section c u r r e n t l y  Seing searched, ot3erwise it 
ternsins 0 at output. The variable KNTRPT shows the nurnh~r  of the 
sect ion currently being searched. #The parameter INDFIL is s e t  to 
0 every time a new section is searched t he  first time. T h i s  
tel ls  t h e  r o u t i n e  t o  b r i n g  rn khe section ind ica ted  hv KVTSCT. 
If its value is 1, the seccion to be read is i nd ica ted  hy KMTPPT. 
The reduced sections are stored i f  T i l e  c o n s e c u t i v e l y .  If 
KNTRPT i s  less than KNTSCT, the sections f o l l o ~ d n g  the one 
currently searched are stored on a temporary f i l e  because t h e  
l e n g t h  of t h e  one b e i n g  searched mav decrease. Not u n t i l  t h e  
search h a s  ended and t h e  c u r r e n t  section has been stored back at 
its proper place are the following gections transferre2 back to 
F i l e  9.. For example, if KNTRPT = 1 and IZNTSCT = 5 ,  t h e n  sections 
2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  and 5 are stored away. 
In the very f i r g t  . run for a given - ?I value, i .e. if K'7TSCT 
equals 1 ,  the routine creates an nmnty l i s t  for the so-zalled 
Removal List. In the quhsequent r u n s  the r o u t i n e  read3 i n  thz 
R e m o v a l .  L i s t  f r o m  t h e  file. 
The routine examines the definition lengths of the en t r i e s  in 
the current section. itemhy item. The entries the definition 
l e n g t h  of which is greater than the se t  N - v a l u e  are put o~ t'ls

i s  .set t n  4 if such entries are found. The remove2 words are 
printed out for  reference. 
Then t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  i s  searched artd a l l  definitions are 
checked a g a i n s t  the items on t h e  Removal List. I f  a c l e f i n i t i p n  
c o n t a i n i n g  a removed word is found, the respectiv~ e n t r y  i t s e l f  
is added to t h e  Removal L i s t  and sul\sequently deleted from tho 
d ic t ionary .  If a search results in any new additions to the 
Removal List, the  search is repeated. This is continued u n t i l  no 
new d e l e t i o n s  occur.  
A f t e r  the ILL n-th section has been processed t h e  first time and 
i f  d e l e t i o n s  have occur red ,  KNTRPT is  set to 1 ,2, . . , ; r

de l e t i ons  ( I D W  s e t  to I ) ,  t h e  sequence is repeated. This i s  
continued u n t i l  IDRP remains i n  all n runs.

A t  the end of every r u n ,  after the temporarilv -- saved 
dictionary s e c t i o n s  nave bee restored, t h e  Removal List is 
stored as t he  l a s t  i n  F i l e  9. Then t h e  values of the key 
variables are printeH out. The data cards are changed 
accordingly f o r  the next run. After t h e  sequence of r u n s  w i t h  
KNTSCT = 5 h a s  been coqpleted,  the operation is f i n i s h e d .

value R was us& insteati. A t  N = 4 .  t h e  size r a t io  was already 
s o  close t o  u n i t y  t h a t  a further r e d u c t i o n  to 2 would no longer 
have been very i n fo rma t ive .  
A l l  s e c t i o n s  of a l l  the s u c c e s s i v e l v  redu-ged dictionaries 
have been preserved on  F i l e  9. P r e s e n t l y  F i l e .  9 has 1 5 lists, 
each ending  w i t h  an EOF. The 16- th  contaxns  t h e  Covered List, 
t h e  Covering List, and the Waiting List from the l a s t  run .  These 
three are not separated by EOF1s as there was no necessity f o r  
separati~g them. This l i s t  c o l l e c t i o n  has no gat t i c u l a r  
importance.  
The remaining s u b r o u t i n e s  i n  the program are short auxiliary 
r o u t i n e s  for aiding t h e  principal r o u t i n e s  where needed. The 
f u n c t i o n  INPUTL reads in a list structure from t h e  card images on 
file, w i t h o u t  p r i n t i n g  o u t  t h e  lisk as does the original SLIP  
routine. It constructs erasable l o c a l  sublists. It  i s  v i r t u a l l y  
t h e  same routine as READLS used by ANA-LEX.

except that it does no t  leave a SLIP ce l l  w i t h  a list name as

cause program termination w i t h  an error message t o  t h e  effect 
that a list was r e q u i r e d  but not found.) 
The subrolltine SKIP is needed for convenient a c c e s s i n g  of t h e  
various l ists i n  F i l e  9. Finally, th$ f u n c t i o n  DLTLST i s  the
