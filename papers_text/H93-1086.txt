PROJECT GOALS 
The primary goal of the SMART information retrieval 
project at CorneU University remains, as it has for the 
past 30 years, investigating the effectiveness and effi- 
ciency of automatic methods of retrieval of text. In re- 
cent years this has expanded to include retrieval of parts 
of documents in response to both user queries (passage 
retrieval) and parts of other documents (automatic hy- 
pertext links). The emphasis of SMART has always been 
on purely automatic text retrieval - -  starting from an ar- 
bitrary piece of natural anguage text from the user and 
matching against automatically indexed documents - -  
and this continues. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Under this rather broad goal, we've performed a number 
of investigations this past year. These include: 
* Local/global matching: Looking at the effect of 
determining an overall global similarity between 
query and document, and then requiring that some 
small local portion of the document (paragraph 
or sentence) focuses in on the query. The overall 
performance l vel of local/global matching for the 
TREC 1 workshop was quite good, though it ap- 
pears the local requirement only gains about 10% 
improvement over a pure global match. 
? Phrases: Examining methods for both statistical 
phrase selection and phrase weighting. For TREC 1, 
SMART's statistical phrases gained 5 to 9% over our 
single term methods. 
? Learned Features of Terms: In cooperation with 
Norbert Fuhr, we've been looking at learning ood 
term weights based upon characteristics of a term 
rather ttlan history of how that term itself behaves. 
This enables us to come up with good term weights 
based upon much less information than conventional 
weight learning techniques. This did very well for 
TREC 1: tied at the top of the automatic ad-hoc 
category with the local/global approach above. 
* Efficiency and Effectiveness Trade-offs: A number 
of tradeoffs were also examined at TREC 1. Major 
conclusions were 
- Retrieval effectiveness can be very reasonably 
traded for retrieval efficiency by truncating the 
retrieval appropriately. 
- Massive stemming of words to their root forms 
has efficiency benefits and costs, but offers no 
significant effectiveness gains. 
- Document indexing can be sped up signifi- 
cantly, at a large cost in disk space. 
Evaluation: Examining evaluation measures uit- 
able for TREC. We supplied the TREC 1 evaluation 
routines, and have designed several other measures 
that may be used for TREC 2. 
Automatic Hypertext: Local/global matching was 
used to automatically construct hypertext links be- 
tween articles of a 29 volume encyclopedia. 
Passage Retrieval: Local/global matching was used 
again to retrieve appropriate scopes of encyclopedia 
articles in response to a query. 
SMART System: A new publicly-available r lease 
of SMART (for research purposes only) was finished 
in June. This release provides upport for multi- 
gigabyte databases. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
We'll be continuing with most of the investigations above 
in the coming year. We'll use automatic learning tech- 
niques to help combine local and global similarities, and 
to help weight phrases. Local/global matching will be 
used heavily in the TREC routing environment toregain 
precision after query expansion techniques. Passage re- 
trieval and automatic document linkage will be extended 
to automatically form a coherent summary reading pat- 
tern for a topic. The SMART system itself will be re- 
vamped to enable very large distributed atabases to be 
searched effectively and efficiently.
