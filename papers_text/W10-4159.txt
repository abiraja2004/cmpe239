Abstract 
With the rapid development of Internet 
and many related technology, Web has 
become the main source of information. 
For many search engines, there are 
many different identities in the returned 
results of character information query. 
Thus the Research of People disambig-
uation is important. In this paper we at-
tempt to solve this problem by combing 
different knowledge.  As people usually 
have different kind of careers, so we first 
utilize this knowledge to classify people 
roughly. Then we use social context of 
people to identify different person. The 
experimental results show that these 
knowledge are helpful for people disam-
biguation. 
1 Introduction 
For the real world, many people share one 
name; this is a very common phenomenon. Ac-
cording to the third national census sample sur-
vey conducted by the State Language Commit-
tee in 1989, the duplicate names rate for single 
name was 67.7%, whereas that of double name 
was 32.4%. 
There are two commonly used name disam-
biguation approach, one is based on the vector 
space model, and the other is based on so-
cial networks.  
The first is text-based vector space clustering 
approach. An entity can be expressed as one 
vector which is formed according to the content 
word of the original document. And then the si-
milarity is used to merge documents or classify 
documents. 
The second method is based on social net-
works. The first step of the method is to build 
social networks, by analyze the relationship of 
different people. Generally if two people?s name 
always occurs in same document or very near  
context ,they will have close relations, one of 
them will be helpful for disambiguate the other. 
In this paper, we first use the domain of cha-
racter?s document to classify roughly, and then 
context information using social networking is 
considered again to disambiguate person?s 
name again. 
2 the principle of our system 
   Fig.1. shows the basic principle of our system. 
The basic steps are: 
 
 
Fig.1. the general framework of our approach 
 
1? documents with same people?s name 
are input; 
2? classify these documents into seven ca-
reers which include Cultural, adminis-
trative, military, science, education, 
sports, health, economic and etc; 
3? Judge if the people are reporter in doc-
ument, if yes; separate them according 
to their address. 
4? Separate documents by using social 
networks. This is because different 
people usually have different social re-
lations. Different social relations usual-
ly means different people and different 
identity. The social network of one 
people is gained by counting its co-
occur frequency with other peoples.

3.2 The performance of our system 
By only utilizing the career domain know-
ledge, the performance is shown in table 1. Ob-
viously the people in this division of the seven 
categories, the accuracy is low and the recall 
rates were high. The reasons include the follow-
ing: 
First, in he document pre-classification 
processing, the named entity recognition has not 
been carried out in the text dealing with the clas-
sification of the document. Some of them are not 
the people?s name. 
Second, different people may have same do-
main, thus the accuracy is adversely affected.

By adding the knowledge of social networks, 
the performance is shown in Fig.2-Fig.3.

Clearly the experiment showed that after 
matching character society attribute information, 
the recall rate increased significantly, and the F 
value also have increased. . 
4 Summaries 
In this paper, we utilize two kind of knowledges: 
1) people always have his own career; 2) people 
have his own social circle.  We think these in-
formation will be more helpful for disambiguation. 
Thus we attempt to solve this problem by com-
bing different knowledge.  As people usually

have different kind of careers, so we first utilize 
this knowledge to classify people roughly. Then 
we use social context of people to identify differ-
ent person.  In the future we wish to address the 
following aspects: 1) add and improve name 
recognition accuracy; 2) extract and select the 
useful context of person?s name, which is the 
problem of information extraction; 3) recognize 
some kind of public people such as political 
leaders, famous singers and etc. to improve the 
effect of social networks.
