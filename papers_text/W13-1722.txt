Abstract
We introduce a cognitive framework for mea-
suring reading comprehension that includes
the use of novel summary writing tasks. We
derive NLP features from the holistic rubric
used to score the summaries written by stu-
dents for such tasks and use them to design a
preliminary, automated scoring system. Our
results show that the automated approach per-
forms well on summaries written by students
for two different passages.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we present our preliminary work on
automatic scoring of a summarization task that is de-
signed to measure the reading comprehension skills
of students from grades 6 through 9. We first intro-
duce our underlying reading comprehension assess-
ment framework (Sabatini and O?Reilly, In Press;
Sabatini et al, In Press) that motivates the task of
writing summaries as a key component of such as-
sessments in ?2. We then describe the summariza-
tion task in more detail in ?3. In ?4, we describe our
approach to automatically scoring summaries writ-
ten by students for this task and compare the results
we obtain using our system to those obtained by hu-
man scoring. Finally, we conclude in ?6 with a brief
discussion and possible future work.
2 Reading for Understanding (RfU)
Framework
We claim that to read for understanding, readers
should acquire the knowledge, skills, strategies, and
dispositions that will enable them to:
? learn and process the visual and typographical
elements and conventions of printed texts and
print world of literacy;
? learn and process the verbal elements of lan-
guage including grammatical structures and
word meanings;
? form coherent mental representations of texts,
consistent with discourse, text structures, and
genres of print;
? model and reason about conceptual content;
? model and reason about social content.
We also claim that the ability to form a coher-
ent mental model of the text that is consistent with
text discourse is a key element of skilled reading.
This mental model should be concise but also reflect
the most likely intended meaning of the source. We
make this claim since acquiring this ability:
1. requires the reader to have knowledge of
rhetorical text structures and genres;
2. requires the reader to model the propositional
content of a text within that rhetorical frame,
both from an author?s or reader?s perspective;
and
3. is dependent on a skilled reader having ac-
quired mental models for a wide variety of
genres, each embodying specific strategies for
modeling the meaning of the text sources to
achieve reading goals.
In support of the framework, research has shown
that the ability to form a coherent mental model
163
is important for reading comprehension. Kintsch
(1998) showed that it is a key aspect in the process of
construction integration and essential to understand-
ing the structure and organization of the text. Sim-
ilarly, Gernsbacher (1997) considers mental models
essential to structure mapping and in bridging and
making knowledge-based inferences.
2.1 Assessing Mental Models
Given the importance of mental models for reading
comprehension, the natural question is how does one
assess whether a student has been able to build such
models after reading a text. We believe that such
an assessment must encompass asking a reader to
(a) sample big ideas by asking them to describe the
main idea or theme of a text, (b) find specific details
in the text using locate/retrieve types of questions,
and (c) bridging gaps between different points in the
text using inference questions. Although these ques-
tions can be multiple-choice, existing research indi-
cates that it is better to ask the reader to write a brief
summary of the text instead. Yu (2003) states that
a good summary can prove useful for assessment of
reading comprehension since it contains the relevant
important ideas, distinguishes accurate information
from opinions, and reflects the structure of the text
itself. More specifically, having readers write sum-
maries is a promising solution since:
? there is considerable empirical support that it
both measures and encourages reading compre-
hension and is an effective instructional strat-
egy to help students improve reading skills
(Armbruster et al, 1989; Bean and Steenwyk,
1984; Duke and Pearson, 2002; Friend, 2001;
Hill, 1991; Theide and Anderson, 2003);
? it is a promising technique for engaging stu-
dents in building mental models of text; and
? it aligns with our framework and cognitive the-
ory described earlier in this section.
However, asking students to write summaries in-
stead of answering multiple choice questions entails
that the summaries must be scored. Asking human
raters to score these summaries, however, can be
time consuming as well as costly. A more cost-
effective and efficient solution would be to use an
automated scoring technique using machine learn-
ing and natural language processing. We describe
such a technique in the subsequent sections.
During the Neolithic Age, humans developed agriculture-what we 
think of as farming.  Agriculture meant that people stayed in one 
place to grow their crops.  They stopped moving from place to 
place to follow herds of animals or to find new wild plants to eat. 
And because they were settling down, people built permanent 
shelters.  The caves they had found and lived in before could be 
replaced by houses they built themselves.
To build their houses, the people of this Age often stacked mud 
bricks together to make rectangular or round buildings.  At first, 
these houses had one big room.  Gradually, they changed to 
include several rooms that could be used for different purposes. 
People dug pits for cooking inside the houses.  They may have 
filled the pits with water and dropped in hot stones to boil it.  You 
can think of these as the first kitchens.
The emergence of permanent shelters had a dramatic effect on 
humans.  They gave people more protection from the weather and 
from wild animals.  Along with the crops that provided more food 
than hunting and gathering, permanent housing allowed people to 
live together in larger communities.
Please write a summary. The first sentence of your summary 
should be about the whole passage.  Then write 3 more 
sentences. Each sentence should be about one of the 
paragraphs.

asked to write a summary, and the summary-writing di-
rections shown to the students.
3 Summary Writing Task
Before describing the automated scoring approach,
we describe the details of the summary writing task
itself. The summarization task is embedded within
a larger reading comprehension assessment. As part
of the assessment, students read each passage and
answer a set of multiple choice questions and, in ad-
dition, write a summary for one of the passages. An
example passage and the instructions can be seen in
Figure 1. Note the structured format of summary
that is asked for in the directions: the first sentence
of the summary must be about the whole passage
and the next three should correspond to each of the
paragraphs in the passage. All summary tasks are
structured similarly in that the first sentence should
identify the ?global concept? of the passage and the
164
next three sentences should identify ?local concepts?
corresponding to main points of each subsequent
paragraph.
Each summary written by a student is scored ac-
cording to a holistic rubric, i.e., based on holistic
criteria rather than criteria based on specific dimen-
sions of summary writing. The scores are assigned
on a 5-point scale which are defined as:
Grade 4: summary demonstrates excellent global
understanding and understanding of all 3 lo-
cal concepts from the passage; does not include
verbatim text (3+ words) copied from the pas-
sage; contains no inaccuracies.
Grade 3: summary demonstrates good global un-
derstanding and demonstrates understanding of
at least 2 local concepts; may or may not in-
clude some verbatim text, contains no more
than 1 inaccuracy.
Grade 2: summary demonstrates moderate local
understanding only (2-3 local concepts but no
global); with or without verbatim text, contains
no more than 1 inaccuracy; OR good global un-
derstanding only with no local concepts
Grade 1: summary demonstrates minimal local
understanding (1 local concept only), with or
without verbatim text; OR contains only verba-
tim text
Grade 0: summary is off topic, garbage, or demon-
strates no understanding of the text; OR re-
sponse is ?I don?t know? or ?IDK?.
Note that students had the passage in front of them
when writing the summaries and were not penalized
for poor spelling or grammar in their summaries. In
the next section, we describe a system to automati-
cally score these summaries.
4 Automated Scoring of Student
Summaries
We used a machine learning approach to build an
automated system for scoring summaries of the type
described in ?3. To train and test our system, we
used summaries written by more than 2600 students
from the 6th, 7th and 9th grades about two differ-
ent passages. Specifically, there were a total of 2695
summaries ? 1016 written about a passage describ-
ing the evolution of permanent housing through his-
tory (the passage shown in Figure 1) and 1679 writ-
ten about a passage describing living conditions at
the South Pole. The distribution of the grades for
the students who wrote the summaries for each pas-
sage is shown in Table 1.

summaries for each of the two passages.
All summaries were also scored by an experi-
enced human rater in accordance with the 5-point
holistic rubric described previously. Figure 2 shows
the distribution of the human scores for both sets of
summaries.

Figure 2: A histogram illustrating the human score distri-
bution of the summaries written for the two passages.
Our approach to automatically scoring these sum-
maries is driven by features based on the rubric.
Specifically, we use the following features:
1. BLEU: BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Under-
study) (Papineni et al, 2002) is an automated
metric used extensively in automatically scor-
ing the output of machine translation systems.
165
It is a precision-based metric that computes n-
gram overlap (n=1 . . . 4) between the summary
(treated as a single sentence) against the pas-
sage (treated as a single sentence). We chose to
use BLEU since it measures how many of the
words and phrases are borrowed directly from
the passage. Note that some amount of borrow-
ing from the passage is essential for writing a
good summary.
2. ROUGE: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Under-
study for Gisting Evaluation) (Lin and Hovy,
2003) is an automated metric used for scoring
summaries produced by automated document
summarization systems. It is a recall-based
metric that measures the lexical and phrasal
overlap between the summary under consider-
ation and a set of ?model? (or reference) sum-
maries. We used a single model summary for
the two passages by randomly selecting each
from the set of student summaries assigned a
score of 4 by the human rater.
3. CopiedSumm: Ratio of the sum of lengths of
all 3-word (or longer) sequences that are copied
from the passage to the length of the summary.
4. CopiedPassage: Same as CopiedSumm but
with the denominator being the length of the
passage.
5. MaxCopy: Length of the longest word se-
quence in the summary copied from the pas-
sage.
6. FirstSent: Number of passage sentences that
the first sentence of the summary borrows 2-
word (or longer) sequences from.
7. Length: Number of sentences in the summary.
8. Coherence: Token counts of commonly used
discourse connector words in the summary.
ROUGE computes the similarity between the
summary S under consideration and a high-scoring
summary - a high value of this similarity indicates
that S should also receive a high score. Copied-
Summ, CopiedPassage, BLEU, and MaxCopy
capture verbatim copying from the passage. First-
Sent directly captures the ?global understanding?
concept for the first sentence, i.e., a large value for
this feature means that the first sentence captures
more of the passage as expected. Length captures
the correspondence between the number of para-
graphs in the passage and the number of sentences
in the summary. Finally, Coherence captures how
well the student is able to connect the different ?lo-
cal concepts? present in the passage. Note that:
? Although the rubric states that students not be
penalized for spelling errors, we did not spell-
correct the summaries before scoring them. We
plan to do this for future experiments.
? The students were not explicitly told to refrain
from verbatim copying since the summary-
writing instructions indicated this implicitly
(?. . . about the whole passage? and ?. . . about
one of the paragraphs?). However, for future
experiments, we plan to include explicit in-
structions regarding copying.
All features were combined in a logistic regres-
sion classifier that output a prediction on the same
5-point scale as the holistic rubric. We trained a sep-
arate classifier for each of the two passage types.1
The 5-fold cross-validation performance of this clas-
sifier on our data is shown in Table 2. We compute
exact as well as adjacent agreement of our predic-
tions against the human scores using the confusion
matrices from the two classifiers. The exact agree-
ment shows the rate at which the system and the
human rater awarded the same score to a summary.
Adjacent agreement shows the rate at which scores
given by the system and the human rater were no
more than one score point apart (e.g., the system as-
signed a score of 4 and the human rater assigned a
score of 5 or 3). For holistic scoring using 5-point
rubrics, typical exact agreement rates are in the same
range as our scores (Burstein, 2012; Burstein et al,
2013). Therefore, our system performed reasonably
well on the summary scoring task. For comparison,
we also show the exact and adjacent agreement of
the most-frequent-score baseline.
It is important to investigate whether the various
features correlated in an expected manner with the
score in order to ensure that the summary-writing
construct is covered accurately. We examined the
weights assigned to the various features in the clas-
sifier and found that this was indeed the case. As ex-
pected, the CopiedSumm, CopiedPassage, BLEU,

and MaxCopy features all correlate negatively with
score, and ROUGE, FirstSent and Coherence cor-
relate positively.
In addition to overall performance, we also exam-
ined which features were most useful to the classi-
fier in predicting summary scores. Table 3 shows the
various features ranked using the information-gain
metric for both logistic regression models. These
rankings show that the features performed consis-
tently for both models.

5 Related Work
There has been previous work on scoring summaries
as part of the automated document summarization
task (Nenkova and McKeown, 2011). In that task,
automated systems produce summaries of multiple
documents on the same topic and those machine-
generated summaries are then scored by either hu-
man raters or by using automated metrics such as
ROUGE. In our scenario, however, the summaries
are produced by students?not automated systems?
and the goal is to develop an automated system to
assign scores to these human-generated summaries.
Although work on automatically scoring student
essays (Burstein, 2012) and short answers (Lea-
cock and Chodorow, 2003; Mohler et al, 2011) is
marginally relevant to the work done here, we be-
lieve it is different in significant aspects based on
the scoring rubric and on the basis of the underlying
RfU framework. We believe that the work most di-
rectly related to ours is the Summary Street system
(Franzke et al, 2005; Kintsch et al, 2007) which
attempts to score summaries written for tasks not
based on the RfU framework and uses latent seman-
tic analysis (LSA) rather than a feature-based classi-
fication approach.
6 Conclusion & Future Work
We briefly introduced the Reading for Understand-
ing cognitive framework and how it motivates the
use of a summary writing task in a reading compre-
hension assessment. Our motivation is that such a
task is theoretically suitable for capturing the abil-
ity of a reader to form coherent mental representa-
tions of the text being read. We then described a
preliminary, feature-driven approach to scoring such
summaries and showed that it performed quite well
for scoring the summaries about two different pas-
sages. Obvious directions for future work include:
(a) getting summaries double-scored to be able to
compare system-human agreement against human-
human agreement (b) examining whether a single
model trained on all the data can perform as well as
passage-specific models, and (c) using more sophis-
ticated features such as TERp (Snover et al, 2010)
which can capture and reward paraphrasing in ad-
dition to exact matches, and features that can better
model the ?local concepts? part of the scoring rubric.
