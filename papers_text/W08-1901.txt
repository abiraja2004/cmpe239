Abstract1 
While large-scale corpora and various 
corpus query tools have long been recog-
nized as essential language resources, the 
value of word association norms as lan-
guage resources has been largely over-
looked. This paper conducts some initial 
comparisons of the lexical relationships 
observed within Japanese collocation da-
ta extracted from a large corpus using the 
Japanese language version of the Sketch 
Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi? et al, 
2008) and the relationships found within 
Japanese word association sets taken 
from the large-scale Japanese Word As-
sociation Database (JWAD) under ongo-
ing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007). 
The comparison results indicate that 
while some relationships are common to 
both linguistic resources, many lexical 
relationships are only observed in one re-
source. These findings suggest that both 
resources are necessary in order to more 
adequately cover the diverse range of 
lexical relationships. Finally, the paper 
reflects briefly on the implementation of 
association-based word-search strategies 
into electronic dictionaries proposed by 
Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006). 
1 Introduction 
Large-scale corpora and various corpus query 
tools have long been recognized as extremely 
important language resources. The impact of

corpora and corpus query tools has been particu-
larly significant in the area of compiling and de-
veloping lexicographic materials (Kilgarriff and 
Rundell, 2002) and in the area of creating various 
kinds of lexical resources, such as WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Atkins et al, 
2003; Fillmore et al, 2003). 
In contrast, although the significance of data-
bases of free word association norms have long 
been recognized within psychology in providing 
insights into higher cognitive processes (Cramer, 
1968; Deese, 1965; Nelson et al, 1998; Steyvers 
and Tenenbaum, 2005), their value as a language 
resource has been largely overlooked. However, 
as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) point out, 
databases of word association norms represent an 
extremely useful supplement to the range of tra-
ditional language resources, such as large-scale 
corpora, thesauri, and dictionaries, and can po-
tentially contribute greatly to the development of 
more sophisticated linguistic resources. 
This paper seeks to demonstrate the potential 
value of word association databases as language 
resources. Specifically, we conduct some initial 
comparisons of the lexical relationships observed 
within Japanese collocation data, as extracted 
from a large corpus with the Japanese language 
version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool 
(Srdanovi? et al, 2008), with those found within 
Japanese word association sets, which were 
created through the ongoing construction of the 
large-scale Japanese Word Association Database 
(JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007). Interesting similar-
ities and differences between the two language 
resources in terms of captured lexical relation-
ships affirm the value of word association data-
bases as rich linguistic resources. In concluding, 
we speculate briefly on how the wider range of 
lexical relationships identifiable through the 
combination of collocation data and word associ-
1
ation databases could be utilized in organizing 
lexical entries within electronic dictionaries in 
ways that are cognitively salient. While we fully 
acknowledge that the challenges involved are 
formidable ones (Zock, 2006), the principled in-
corporation of word association knowledge with-
in electronic dictionaries could greatly facilitate 
the development of more flexible and user-
friendly navigation and search strategies (Zock 
and Bilac, 2004). 
2 Basic Concepts: Word Sketches and 
Word Association Norms 
This section briefly provides some background 
information about SkE, which is the corpus 
query tool used in this study to extract and dis-
play word collocation data, and about word asso-
ciation norms as gathered through psychological 
experimentation. 
2.1 Sketch Engine (SkE): Word Sketches 
and Thesaurus Tools 
Sketch Engine (SkE) (Kilgarriff et al 2004) is a 
web-based corpus query tool that supports a 
number of functions. These include fast concor-
dancing, grammatical processing, ?word sketch-
ing? (one-page summaries of a word?s grammati-
cal and collocation behavior), a distributional 
thesaurus, and robot use. SkE has been applied to 
a number of languages. In this study, we utilize 
the Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions for 
the Japanese language. As both tools process raw 
collocation data by organizing words according 
to grammatical and lexical relationships, they are 
particularly suited to the conducted comparisons 
with the word association data. 
Word Sketches (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001) 
present the most frequent and statistically-salient 
collocations and grammatical relations for a giv-
en word. These relations are derived as the re-
sults of grammatical analysis (a gramrel file) that 
employs regular expressions over PoS-tags. 
The distributional thesaurus groups together 
words that occur in similar contexts and have 
common collocation words. Estimations of se-
mantic similarity are based on ?shared triples?. 
For example, <read a book> and <read a maga-
zine> share the same triple pattern of <read a ?>, 
and because ?book? and ?magazine? exhibit high 
salience for the triple, they are both assumed to 
belong to the same thesaurus category. This ap-
proach is similar to conventional techniques for 
automatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998). 
2.2 Word Association Norms 
In contrast to the Word Sketch collocation and 
thesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basic 
input language resource, databases of word asso-
ciation norms are the results of psychological 
experiments. The free word association task typi-
cally asks the respondent to respond with the first 
semantically-related word that comes to mind on 
presentation of a stimulus word. 
The collection of word association normative 
data can be traced back to the seminal study by 
Kent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered word 
association responses for a list of 100 stimulus 
words. However, despite the insightful remarks 
of Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that word 
associations closely mirror the structured patterns 
of relations that exist among concepts?claims 
that undoubtedly warrant further investigation?
there are, unfortunately, still relatively few large-
scale databases of word association norms. The 
notable exceptions for the English language in-
clude the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus 
(EAT) (Kiss et al, 1973), which consists of ap-
proximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus list 
of 8,400 words, and the University of South Flor-
ida Word Association, Rhyme, and Word Frag-
ment Norms compiled by Nelson et al (1998), 
consisting of nearly three-quarters of a million 
responses to 5,019 stimulus words. Another da-
tabase deserving mention is the Russian Associa-
tion Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al 
(1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately 
23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (cited 
in Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004). 
3 Japanese Language Resources 
This section introduces the Japanese language 
resources utilized in this study: namely, the Jap-
anese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi? 
et al, 2008) and the Japanese Word Association 
Database (Joyce, 2005, 2007). 
3.1 Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus 
The Japanese version of SkE is based on JpWaC 
(Erjavec et al, 2007; Srdanovi? et al, 2008), 
which is a 400-million word Japanese web cor-
pus that has been morphologically analyzed and 
POS-tagged with the ChaSen tool 
(http://chasen.naist.jp/). The Word Sketches are 
based on Japanese grammatical analysis results 
(gramrel file), where 22 grammatical relations 
are defined based on ChaSen PoS tags and to-
kens (Srdanovi? et al2008). Figure 1 presents 
2
parts of word sketches for the noun fuyu (? win-
ter), showing adjective modifications and two 
verb relations involving the particles of wa (?
topic marker) and ni (? time marker), respec-
tively.

noun fuyu (? winter). 
3.2 Japanese Word Association Database 
To an even greater extent than for the English 
language, there has been a serious lack of word 
association norms for the Japanese language. 
While Umemoto?s (1969) survey collected asso-
ciations from 1,000 university students, the li-
mited set of just 210 words merely underscores 
the deficient. More recently, Okamoto and Ishi-
zaki (2001) compiled an Associative Concept 
Dictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 word 
association responses provided by 10 respon-
dents for 1,656 nouns. However, it should be 
noted that the ACD is not strictly free association 
data because response category was specified as 
part of the task. 
Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005, 
2007), the Japanese Word Association Database 
(JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a very 
large-scale database of free word association 
norms for the Japanese language in terms of both 
the number of stimulus items and the numbers of 
association responses collected. The present 
JWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japa-
nese kanji and words. The currently available 
JWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of 
104,800 free word association responses col-
lected through a paper questionnaire survey with 
a sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50 
respondents. The association sets compared with 
work sketch profiles in the subsequent sections 
are from JWAD-V1. 
4 Conducted Comparisons 
This section presents the results of our initial 
comparison for the lexical relationships observed 
within the Japanese collocation data with those in 
the Japanese word association sets. The compari-
sons focused on approximately 350 word associ-
ation responses constituting the association sets 
for the two verbs of kizuku (??? to notice) 
and sagasu (?? to search for), the adjective of 
omoshiroi (???  interesting), and the three 
nouns of jitensha (???  bicycle), natsu (? 
summer), and yama (? mountain), as examples 
of basic Japanese vocabulary. Taking into ac-
count the considerable degree of orthographic 
variation present with the Japanese writing sys-
tem, all possible orthographic variations were 
searched for in the SkE, such as kizuku (???/
???) and omoshiroi (???/?????). 
4.1 Word Sketches and Thesaurus Versus 
Word Association Norms 
The Japanese SkE employs a large-scale Japa-
nese corpus and detailed grammatical analysis 
based on ChaSen POS tags. Accordingly, nu-
merous lexical relationships are identified in the 
word sketches and thesaurus results. For example, 
kizuku appears 12,134 times in the corpus in ap-
proximately 200 collocation examples in total, 
which are grouped under 12 different collocation 
and grammatical relations and sorted according 
to the statistical salience of the relation?s fre-
quency within the corpus (note that searches 
were conducted with the default setting of only 
including collocations with frequencies of five or 
more). The thesaurus function also yields numer-
ous results, typically displaying around 60 salient 
relations that are clustered into five semantic 
groups. In contrast, while JWAD-V1 is quite 
large-scale for a word association databases, it is 
naturally far smaller than the Japanese SkE cor-
pus. As already noted, it consists of word associ-
ation collected from about 50 respondents (al-
though there are 100 respondents in the case of 
kizuku), and where some responses would ob-
viously be provided by multiple respondents. 
Comparisons of the SkE results with the sets 
of word association responses revealed that there 
is considerable overlap in the range of lexical 
relationships observed in the two linguistics re-
sources. However, the comparisons also identi-
fied many lexical relationships that are only 
present in one of the language resources. 
3
Because of the large differences in the overall 
sizes of the association responses in JWAD-V1 
and the collocations in SkE, it is not surprising 
that the word association data does not cover the 
numerous collocation words present in the SkE 
results. (In future studies, we plan to examine the 
kinds of relationships that are extracted from the 
corpora but which are not observed in the word 
association database). However, it is very inter-
esting to note that a considerable number of the 
JWAD word associations were not present in the 
SkE results, even though the tool is drawing on a 
much larger resource. In this study, we concen-
trate on describing these lexical relationships.

present (+) and absent (-) in the Word Sketches 
(WS) and the Thesaurus (T) results

jitensha 7 13 0 2 10 0 
natsu 3 4 1 5 13 1 
yama 6 3 2 8 7 2 
 
Table 1 shows that considerable numbers of 
word association responses with frequencies of 
two or more, as well as many with frequencies of 
one, are not observed in the word sketches and 
thesaurus results. While these results could be 
indicating a need to consider new methods or 
approaches to corpus-extraction in addition to 
those currently employed, these findings also 
strongly suggest that some of the lexical relation-
ships might be unique to the normative word as-
sociation data. Both resources unquestionably tap 
into fundamental aspects of lexical relationships, 
but the resources would seem to be quite differ-
ent in nature. Accordingly, the present results 
suggest that investigations into lexical relation-
ships would do well to employ both corpus-based 
results and databases of word association norms 
in complementary ways, in order to provide more 
comprehensive coverage of the diverse range of 
lexical relationships. 
The thesaurus function only outputs lexical re-
lationships between words of the same word 
class. This function also yields synonym rela-
tionships that are also found in the word associa-
tion norms, and are rated as being highly salient 
for the thesaurus results. For example, tanoshii 
and kyomibukai (???? interesting) are word 
association responses for omoshiroi. 
4.2 Lexical Relationships that are Common 
to Both the Corpus-Based Results and 
the Word Association Norms 
This section discusses some of the lexical rela-
tionships common to the two resources. The 
most frequent of these are presented in Table 2. 
The first ?coord? group includes kawa (? riv-
er) with the noun of yama, tanoshii (??? 
pleasant) with the adjective of omoshiroi, and 
odoroku (?? to be surprised) with the verb of 
kizuku. Other frequent relationships are verbal 
phrases involving appropriate particles (such as 
nounNI (e.g., jitensha ni noru (?????? to 
ride a bicycle), noPronom, nounWO (e.g., michi 
wo sagasu (???? to look for a road), deVerb, 
niVerb). Table 2 also includes a number of mod-
ification relationships (modifier_Adv, modifi-
er_Ai (e.g., atsui natsu (??? hot summer)). 
Note that these terms are those employed in the 
Word Sketch results.

4.3 Relations Specific to Association Norms 
While acknowledging that it could be beneficial 
to examine the types of lexical relationships ob-
served in the corpus-based results but not in the 
word association data, given the relative differ-
ences in the sizes of the two resources, the 
present study focuses on the relationships that 
were only present in the database of word associ-
ation norms. Briefly, these relationships can be 
classified under six categories. 
(1) Relationships involving a specific concept 
related to the stimulus word and its contextual 
meaning. In Table 3 below, many of these are 
classified as ?typically associated? words. Exam-
ples include omoshiroi and warai (????
?????  laughter), kizuku and ch?i (?? 
attention), and natsu and taiy? (?? sun). These 
relationships are neither collocational nor gram-
matical in nature, and so the grammatical analy-
sis currently employed in the word sketches can-
not identify them. On the other hand, while they 
are semantically related, because they often be-
long to different word classes, the thesaurus 
function also fails to identify them. 
(2) Relationships that are semantically similar 
(could be regarded as close synonyms) but do not 
belong to the same word class. Examples include 
sagasu and tanky? (?? search) and kizuku and-
kikubari (???  care, attention). While these 
are not grammatical or collocational relations, 
again, the thesaurus function is also unable to 
find them because they belong to different word 
classes. 
(3) Association responses consisting of more 
than one word. Examples include explanatory 
phrases such as kibun ga ii (?????  lit. 
?feeling is good?, comfortable) as response to 
omoshiroi, as well as concepts denoted by phras-
es, such as hito no kao (??? human faces), 
also a response to omoshiroi. 
(4) Relationships that could be recognized by the 
SkE, but which the present version fails to detect. 
These would seem to reflect limitations with the 
present ChaSen dictionary (e.g., it does not list 
chari / charinko (????????? casual 
words for bicycle) or morphological/POS-
tagging errors with ChaSen, or relationships that 
are not regarded as being sufficiently salient 
within the complete corpus, because they may 
appear frequently as both independent words and 
as constituents of many poly-morpheme words 
(e.g., omoshiroi hito (???? interesting per-
son)). 
(5) Relationships that can be identified when 
search is executed for orthographic variants of 
the word, such as tsumaranai (????? bor-
ing) being found when omoshiori is written in 
hiragana (as ?????). 
(6) Word association responses that are rather 
idiosyncratic in nature, often reflecting private 
experiences of a single respondent. The impor-
tance of such responses in word association data-
bases should be judged on the size of the data-
base, although one also should be cautious about 
sampling issues with lower respondent numbers. 
While it would certainly be interesting to con-
duct further comparisons between the association 
norms and other kinds of corpora, such as literary 
works, newspapers, or more balanced corpora, 
processed by the SkE, the main purpose of the 
present paper is to draw attention to the value of 
word association databases as linguistic re-
sources. Although the lexical relationships in 
categories 1 and 2 were not observed in the 
present corpus-based results, they are unques-
tionably of great relevance to efforts to develop 
more principled organizations of the lexicon for 
navigational purposes, and would enhance exist-
ing lexical resources, such as WordNet. With 
trends to increasingly include multiple word 
idioms and phrases within various dictionaries 
and linguistic resources, the multiple-word asso-
ciation responses of category 3 may provide fur-
ther insights into how such items are stored and 
processed. Moreover, categories 4 and 5 clearly 
suggest that free word association norms can be a 
very useful resource for evaluating and further 
improving morphological analyzers, as well as 
corpus query tools. 
5 Lexicographical Implications:  
Organizing Lexicons According to 
Association Relationships 
As the merits of SkE and its significant contribu-
tions to the compilation of a number of major 
dictionaries are discussed in detail elsewhere 
(e.g., Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002), and because 
Srdanovi? and Nishina (2008) outline some poss-
ible lexicographical applications of the Japanese 
language version of the SkE, in this section, we 
focus on the lexical relationships observed within 
the JWAD and their lexicographical implications 
for realizing a principled association-based or-
ganization of the lexicon.

5.1 Linguistic Approaches to Association 
Data and Its Potential 
As previously commented, Deese (1965) and 
Cramer (1968) have both argued that word asso-
ciations closely mirror the structured patterns of 
relations that exist among concepts. Indeed, as 
Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) note, Deese 
(1965) was the first to conduct linguistic analyses 
of word association norms, such as measure-
ments of semantic similarity based on his convic-
tions that similar words evoke similar word asso-
ciation responses?an approach that is somewhat 
reminiscent of Church and Hanks? (1990) notion 
of mutual information. 
However, as we have also remarked already, 
the linguistic value of word association data has, 
regrettably, been largely overlooked. In a similar 
spirit to Hirst?s (2004) claim that, notwithstand-
ing certain caveats on the complex relationships 
between them, a lexicon can often serve as a use-
ful basis for developing a practical ontology, we 
believe that a very promising approach to orga-
nizing the lexicon would be to more fully appre-
ciate and utilize the rich variety of associative 
relationships that exist within word association 
norms. While the required, more thoroughgoing 
investigation into how to appropriately classify 
the complex nature of associative relationships is 
beyond the scope of this present study, in the 
next sub-section, we attempt to highlight the po-
tential contributions that word association norms 
could provide to efforts seeking to explore lexi-
cal knowledge. 
5.2 Tentative Classification of Association 
Relationships 
To illustrate some of the issues for developing 
a comprehensive, yet a parsimonious, classifica-
tion of associative relationships, it is useful to 
briefly consider the notion proposed by Zock and 
Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006) of word search 
strategies in electronic dictionaries based on as-
sociations. Their outline of how such a look-up 
system might function employs three kinds of 
basic association relationships; namely, ?a kind 
of? (AKO), ?subtype? (ISA), and ?typically in-
volved object, relation or actor? (TIORA). While 
we accept that the limited set of just three types 
was probably motivated primarily in the interests 
of simplicity, given Zock?s (2006) suggestion to 
enhance the navigability of the system by catego-
rizing relationships, clearly the classification of 
association relationships is a fundamental issue. 
Table 3 presents a tentative classification of 
the word association responses for the noun win-
ter. As the comparisons introduced in Section 4 
clearly demonstrate, it is usually possible to ex-
tract the modification and lexical sibling rela-
tionships included in Table 3 from corpora with 
corpus query tools such as SkE. However, the 
comparisons also highlighted the fact that it is far 
more difficult to identify the kinds of relation-
ships classified in Table 3 as typically associated 
with such linguistic resources alone. While high-
ly provisional in nature, we believe that the at-
tempt to classify the association relationships 
within the association responses for fuyu can 
6
serve to highlight some important issues for Zock 
and Bilac?s (2004) approach. 
While the lexical siblings relationships be-
tween fuyu and the two response words of natsu 
(? summer) and haru (? spring) could feasibly 
be represented by AKO or ISA relationship links 
to shiki (?? the four seasons) outside of the 
association set itself, having to rely on external 
references would not be a very satisfactory ap-
proach to classifying the direct association rela-
tionships. Incidentally, although the ?hyponyms 
of ?seasons?? description would seem fairly natu-
ral from the perspective of a thesaurus, the ab-
sence of aki (? autumn) from the set would in-
dicate that the strengths of associations can vary 
even among lexical siblings (although the ab-
sence of aki from the present data could simply 
be due to sampling issues). 
Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of sev-
eral modification relationships is not very sur-
prising, at least not for the prime associate of 
samui (?? cold), but the idea of fuyu having a 
color attribute is perhaps initially more startling 
(while one many not expect ?winter? to have a 
default color slot within its range of attributes, 
the association of shiroi (?? white) with fuyu 
is initiatively appealing). 
For the fuyu association set, the most relevant 
of the association relationships specified by Zock 
and Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship. 
However, even for this relatively small associa-
tion set containing just 11 main relationship 
types, because seven of them can be initially 
classified as ?typically associated?, clearly this 
designation alone is too encompassing to be a 
useful classification category. The inclusion of 
the description field in Table 3 is an attempt to 
further define meaningful sub-categories. In the 
case of the sub-category ?meteorological pheno-
mena?, it would seem to be well motivated to 
explain the associations between fuyu as the sti-
mulus word and yuki (? snow) and k?ri (? ice) 
as two response words. However, while the sub-
category of ?cultural artifacts? clearly goes some 
way to pinpointing the underlying association 
between fuyu and kotatsu (???), it does rely 
on a certain cultural familiarity with the kind of 
quilted kind of blanket that are used for keeping 
one?s legs warm when sitting around a low fami-
ly table during winter. A natural association for 
anyone who has ever lived in Japan during the 
winter months, but ?typically associated? + ?cul-
tural artifact? seems to miss something of the 
naturalness. 
6 Conclusions 
This paper has compared the lexical relationships 
observed within Japanese collocation data ex-
tracted from a large corpus using the Japanese 
language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool 
and the relationships found within Japanese word 
association sets taken from the large-scale Japa-
nese Word Association Database (JWAD). 
The comparison results indicate that while 
many lexical relationships are common to both 
linguistic resources, a number of lexical relation-
ships were only observed in one of the resources. 
The fact that some lexical relationships might be 
unique to word association norms demonstrates 
the value of word association databases as lin-
guistic resources. The present findings suggest 
that both resources can be effectively used in 
combination in order to provide more compre-
hensive coverage of the wide range of lexical 
relationships. 
Finally, we presented a tentative classification 
of the association relationships in the association 
set for fuyu. Our brief discussion of the classifi-
cation sought to reflect on some of the challenges 
to realizing a principled association-based organ-
