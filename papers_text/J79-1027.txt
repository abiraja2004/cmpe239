This paper outlines a psychologically constrained theory of 
sentence comprehension The most prominent features of the theory 
are that: (1) syntactic structure is discarded clause by clause 
(where the traditional notion of clause is modified in certain 
respects  so as to conform t o  short term memory requirements); 
(2) the syntactic and semantic processor work in parallel. 
The semantic analysis proceeds from the preliminary semantic 
representation (PSR) via the intermediate SR (ISR) to the final 
SR (FSR), making crucial use O X  an encyclopedia which codes se- 
mantic knowledge. 
The three stages of the semantic analysis are discussed. 
Concatenation Rules establish the PSR, Meaning Rules and Ency- 
clopedic Rules the ISR, and Semantic Linking Strategies the FSR. 
At every stage, the semantic representations are in terms of a 
modified p r e d i c a t e  ca~culus notation. 
Syntax-free as well as syntax-sensitive Linking Strategies 
are presented for clause-internal linking. Finally, syntax-free 
linking of constituent clauses of complex sentences is described.

I . SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS 
ON SENTENCE COMPREHENSION MODELS 
In t h i s  paper I consider t h e  question of how an automat ic  
sentence recognizer would have to look in order to be compatible 
wLth present psycholinguistic knowledge about speech c o m p r e h m h  
The basic premise is that psycholinguistic considerations are of 
potential interest to computational theories (see ,  e . g . ,  
~chank(1972)  
Let me begin by summarizing some characteristics of speeck 
processing which we know either from experiments, or which are 
i n t u i t i v e l y  clear. 
First, there i s  some evidence t h a t  the clause i s  a u n i t  of 
processing. For instance, ~aplan(1972) showed that after 
a clause boundary is passed, the cons-bitaent words bf the 
completed clause are relatively inaccesai'ble, as measured by 
w m d  recognition la tency.  The ef fect  was independent of the 
serial position of the word for which recognition time was 
tested. This  suggests that sentences are processed clause by 
clause, w i t h  on ly  the semantic content regularly retained after 
the clause boundary is passed. The surface words (and g fortiori 
the syntactic s tructure)  of the clause would tend t o  be erased 
after each clause boundary. 1 
*Thie paper is  based on chapter VII of  my doctoral dissertation 
(~eimold (forthcoming) ) . I wish to thank Thomas G . Bever , 
Jame-a Higginbotham, and D *Terence Langendoen f o r  h e l p f u l  
suggestions. 
l ~ h e  f o r t i o r i J  refers to the fact that the syntactic s t r u c t u r e  
Another study supporting the c lause as unit of proceasing 
is Abrams 6 ~ever(1969) .  These a u t h o r s  found t h a t  r eac t ion  t ime 
to s h o r t  bursts of noise "cl icks")  superimposed on sentences 
was longer for clause-final clicks than for clause-initial 
ones. This would point to the clause as unit of perception, 
under the assumption t h a t  processing is more intensive towards 
the end of a perce~tua l  unit, and that reaction time to e x t e r n a l  
stimuli is a valid ineicator of t h e  intensity of internal 
procesging.  or a review of other studies in support of the 
clausal processing theory, the reader i s  referred to 
Podor, Bever & ~arre%t(1974), where arguments a r e  a l s o  given 
f o r  the clause as a decision point across which ambiguitiis 
are ,normally at least ,  not carried-. )
Secondly, it seems t h a t  as we l i s t e n  to speech, we 
simultaneously have access to both the syntactic and semantic 
propertiee of what we hear. That is, there appears to be ~ a r a l l e l  
orocessing of the  syntax and the semantics of a clause. One 
finding explained by this assumption i s  that  so-called 
"irreversible" passive sentences like (1) are perceptually no 
more complex thnn their active counterparts (the air1 ~ i c k e d  
the rlower,in this case) .  By cont ras t ,  'reversiblew passives 
l i k e  ( 2 )  take longer to verify vis-a-vis p i c t u r e s  than the  
~orre~pondin$ active sentences (~lobin(1.966) ) . 
presumably contain8 surface wards as terminal nodes. Hence if 
the eyntax were regularly preserved the surface words should 
remain easily accessible, too. 
(1) The f l o w e ~  was picked by the  g i r l .  (irreversible) 
(2) The boy was kicked  by the girl. (reversible)  
It appears that the  syntactic complexity introduced by 
the passive construction i s  somehow circumvented by a 
predominantly semantic method of analysis in the  case of 
i&reversible passives m2 We thus get a picture of speech 
processing as in ~ i ~ ~ l . 3

2~nother  experimental study su parting the  Parallel. Processing 
theory is larslen-lilson(l973 !' . 
3 ~ y  view of the r o l e  of syntax is related to t h a t  expressed in 
~chank(1972), who believes that the function of syntax is 
""as a pointer to semantic information rather than as a f irs t  
step to aemantic analysis?' ( ~ ~ 5 5 5 )  Similarly, winograd (1971) 
a l l o w s  parallel operation of syntactic and semantic analysis. 
However, m e  syntactic and semantic processor in Winograd's 
systehr have f u l l  power, in minciple ,  to question each other 
about their respective success before proceeding with their  
part pf the  analysis* This powerful device has been aeverely 
restricted in the  theory described here (for details, see 
Reimold (f o r t h c  oming) ) The main reasons f o r  th ie  are the  
greater re l iance ,  in my theory, on "syntax-free" semantic 
interpretation, and the generally shorter life-apan of 
syntactic structure (see t h e  d iscuss ion  of "peripheral 
clauses" b e l o w ) .  Woods (1973) also discussee  a system w i t h  
cer ta in  facilities f o r  parallel processing, for instance, 
the "Selnctlve Modifier Placement" facility (sMP)~ The 
function of SMP is to ~ e l s c t  from the list o f  syn%actically 
adrnissibLe alternatives the one which is semantically most 
appropriate, and return only that alternative to the  parser 
before golng an *o analyze the r e s t  o f  the sentence. The most 
important difference between Woods' proposal and the one 
presented here is that his semantic processor o n l y  chooaes 
among t a c t  tructQrsd alternatives (and, in t h a t  sense,% a fu%$%$tax-sensltve method),  whereas my t h e o r y  
partdates rn gyntactfclm m e n  w h  modif iers  and t h e i r  heads .  
Let me return now to the principle of clause-by-clause 
processing, If we assume that "imqediate processing" takes 
place in short term memory, then we must automatically 
requkre that t h e  unit of processing m u s t  not exceed the known 
Limits of s h o r t  term memory. Now since t h a t  limit is generally 
taken to be about 5 wordsp the clause-by-clause princ ip le  
cannot  be literally true. For instance. ( 3 )  lists some "clauses" 
longer than 5 w o r d s .  It seems to me, therefore, t h a t  we have 
to revise the traditional concept of olause*

Z propose to take the underlined phrases in ( 3 )  o u t  of the 
sentence proper and process them as if they w e r e  separate 
clauses. That is, f draw a distinction between t h e  "nucLearH 
clause and "peripheralw clauses. The non-underlined 'portions 
in (3)  are nuclear clauses. Peripheral clauses include: 
Prep-clauses ( " w i t h  t h e  c o l l a r " ) ,  Comparison-clauses ("than 
the old c o l o n e l w ) .  Post-clauses ("yesterday, 'I "around ten o t c l o ~

This treatment of ce r t a in  phrases as peripheral clauses 
seems plaus ib le  t o o ,  if w e  consider t h a t  "adnominal" Prep- 
phrases, f o r  instance, are semantically l i k e  r e l a t i v e  clauses, 
as shown in (4), and that  adverbs are para l le l  to c e r t a i n

etanding whlch."has a conceptual base t h a t  coneiate of a 
formal etructurew and "can make predictfons on the basis 
o f  this conceptual structurew( ,556)  The principal d i f ferences  
between these approaches and m f ne have to do w i t h  (1) the  
of the stored semantic information (PLANNER and "conceptual 
case networkn representations vsc predicate calculus 
representations) and ( 2 )  the proposed ~ c c e m  ~ c h a n 5 s ~  to 
th ia  infobmation. Schank's theory relies on l e x L c a l  decornpoeLtion, 
while I uae the "meaning postulates" methodr Winograd opts for 
a broad procedural approach, representing "knowledge in the 
form of praceuuree rather than tables of rules or lists of 
pattern~~"(p.21) By contrast, my proposal remaine c lose r  to 
the traditional WdeclarativeH approach, as w i l l  become clear  
because J. Know someznlng aDout  turkeys and freezers. No model 
excluding the  possibility af matching speech against stored 
knowledge of the world can explain such fac t s .  In this 
connection, consider a l so  t h e  sentences in (911

These sentences can a11 be understood without difficultyr 
and t h e  way we understand them is by using our general semantic 
knowledge. 
What t h i s  means, then, is  that the comprehension model 
needs to incorporate an encyclopedia which somehow codes 
semantic knowledge. 
In slm, to be compatible with the psychological model, the 
al~tomatic sentence recognizer should have the following 
properties 8 
(1) it should be a clause-by-clause processo2, where my n o t i o n  
of "-lause" includes some things traditionally regarded as 
phrases; as soon as the in te rpre ta t ion  of a clause is 
completed, its syntactic structure is erased; 
(2)  there should be parallel syntactic and semantic processing 
of each clause1 
( 3 )  the recognizer must make systematic use of an encyclopedia 
which codes knowledge about the w o r l d *  
IIt TZADITIONAL LINGUISTIC APPROACHES 
Putting together the above observations, one can already 
see that current linguistic theories a r e  n o t  very h e l p f u l  for 
the eolution of our problem. Fnr inetance, linguistic theory 
would claim that sentence (10) has the syntactic structwe in 
(11)~ which then undergoes various syntactic transformations 
until it is finally mapped onto i t s  appropriate semantic 
s true ture . 
The rrentence recognizers moat directly meetfng this descriptior 
are robabl those developed by Stanley Petr ick  (see P e t r i c k  ( ~ 9 6 9 ,  197)y) . Wlth some modlf icatione, however, t h i s  
deecription also  f i t s  the theories preeerited in Winograd (1971) 
and Woode (1973). Whkle these syetema are feature-manipulating 
rather than transformational, they nonetheless assume t h a t  the 
life-span of syntax extends over an entire sentence, and they 
make crucial use of integrated syntactic structures f o r  
corn l a x  sentences  or instan~e, winograd (1971) presents 
an f ntegrated syntactic structure for the sentence "Pick  up 
anything green, at l eas t  three of the blocker and either 
a box or a sphere which is bigger than any brick on the table. 
Recagnlzere ueing an inverse "Geherative Se'lllantics" grammar 
would a ldo  f a l l  under t h i s  deecriptioh. 
(10) The man with the beard claimed f i erce ly  t h a t  he w a s  
innocent. 
fiercely t h a t  h~ ent 
But in the vLew I have just sketched, sentence (10) never 
has any integrated syntactic structure like (11). Instead, as 
shown in (121, the string with the beard, for instance, i s  
processed as a separate c lause ,  and as soon as. i t s  meaning 
has been extracted and added as qual i f i er  to t h e  preceding 
noun phrase the man, its syntactic structure is erased.

[c la imed MVB] 
Lq ma< 
Similarly, the  "Post+ Lause" f i erce ly  and the entire 
complement clause that he was innocent must be linked to 
the main clause without referring to the syntactic struc~ure 
of the  latter, which is assumed to be erased as soon as the 
word claimed has been semantically integrate& This would 
seem t o  be a more economical procedure, because it minimizes 
the size of the syntactic ballast  t h a t  has to be carried 
along. C~mparsr for instance, the  s i ze  of the chunk in (11) 
to the s i z e  0.4 the little chunks in (12). 
Secondly, transformational grammar is hardly  compatible 
w i t h  the principle of parallel Processins of the eyntax and 
semantics of a @lausem The reason is that  accdrding to 
transformational grammar, the syntactic analysis precedes and 
determines the semaqtic analysis. By contrast, Parallel 
Processing means that at least some of the semantic inter- 
pretation rules must be syntax-free. 
111 a A THREE-STAGE THEORY OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS 
Lez US reT;urn Lor a moment to rlg.l. T h a t  rlgure contained 
a box label led  gyn*actic p r a c e w ,  and another box labe l l ed  
semantic proceseoP. As I have s t a t e d ,  these  components cannot 
be identified with the eyntactic and semantic components of 
current transformational grammar . The syntactic processor w i l l  
not be d i s c u s s e d  in deta i l  here (see ~eimold~forthcoming) f o r  
a fuller diacuesiori) .  It is a predictive parser using d-ency 
* 
notation. There are-no syptactic transformations at all, but 
the output is a simple surface tree for each clbause, with 
certain nodes marked by functional features like SuBJect, 
OBJ1, OBJ2, or MainVerB. The trees m (-12) above are exarpples. 
For the remainder, let me concentrate on t h e  semantic box. 
I suggest t h a t  there are three stapes in the semantic analysis. 
as shown in FigS, namely a preliminary, intermediate, and 
f.inal semantic representatton (PSR, ISR, and FSR).

The PSIi corresponds to a simple comblnat ip~~ of t h e  l ex ica l

sentence, we immediately grasp their i n d i 4 i d u a l  meaning, even 
though we m a y  not be sure yet how they f i t  together.  Thi-s' then 
f s the  preliminary SR. 
But we a l s ~  immediately have access to some of the 
immJ,ications of t h e  words and phrases. For instance, if I hear

Before translatAmg the structures in (13) into English 
let  me remark on the form of semantic representations. 
3 3 :  A MODIFIED PREDICATE CALCULUS NOTATION 
$OR SmANTIC REPRESENTATIONS 
Bgch semantic representation consists of a number of 
mef iaeq- a n d  a matrix, where t he  prewf i x e s  oorrespona roughly 
to the noun phrased of the sentence, and the matrix to t h e  
main predicate. For easier reference, I have marked t h i s  
distinction in the t e x t  by always enclosing t h e  matrix in 
square bracke%s * c f " . 6 
For instance, in (13) there are three prefixes, and the  
matrix i& LAUGHVYI. 
Each prefix consists of a quantifier (e.g., THE, g --which 
reade "there is at least  onew-- or ALL), f o l l o w e d  by a 
variable g &,y,=,&,g --represented by lower case l e t t ers  
6 The lfnear notatLon used throughout here is an abbreviation 
defined over dependency stru~tures . For d e t a i l s ,  see 
~ e ~ m o l 4  (forthcoming), where definitions a r e  a l s o  given f o r  
tranelating them structures into standard predicate calculus.  
in the examples), and optionally followed by a backmounded 
proposition. Backgrounded propositions are the expressions to 
the rl&t of the  colon w i t h i n  the prefixes. For instance, the 
first prefix in (13) contains the  quantifier THE, t h e  variable 
&@ and a backgrounded pl?oposition BO'lhc, and the entire  prefix 
is readt "The entity x such mat x is &.boy. #I 
We can now translate t he  structures 111 (13) i n t o  Engl i sh .  
The first ,  L e e ,  t h e  preliminary S I i ,  sayst 
"%e x such t h a t  x. is a boy is invowed in somE 
vent suoh t h a t  there is some y and some time 
which is PAST, and .y is laughing at time t." 
Notice t h a t  t h i s  only asserts that the boy is somehow 
,invo&%ed in t h i s ,  but it does not specify j u s t  h . 0 ~ .  B u t  
in order to describe what the l ig tener  actually understand$ 
when hearing %he bov l a u d e d ,  we must o f  course specify 
which r o l e  the boy plays in t h i s  event. 
Now, looking at the final SH in (13). it can be seen t h a t  
it i s  l i k e  t h e  PS3, except t h a t  it a l s o  contains a r o l e  
p s s i m e n t  (or $ink, as I w i l l  caL1 it), namely x=y:. That is, 
5, t h e  boy, playe t h e  role of y, who was the  one who d i d  the  
laughing. By executing t h i s  equation x-Y, we can of course 
simplify the representation, which gives us t h e  last l i n e  
in (13) 
The intermediate SR in (13), furthermore, is l i k e  t h e  
preliminary SR, but in addition contains certain implicat ions 
of t h e  words. Thus we have: "the x such t h a t  x is a boy and 
(by implication) human and not adult .  e t c  . * And in the matrix 
of the fSR we get "y laughs at time t and, by implication, 
y is hman and anima-te and alive-at-time-t.* In o t h e r  words, 
one cann.ot laugh unless one i s  human and alive 
Vs THE PSR J CONCUENATION RULES 
Let us return wain to Fig.2. It shows three different  
blocks of rules which are responsible for deriving the three 
stages of the semantic analysis, namely, Concatenation Rules, 
Meaning Rules and Encyclopedic Rules (collectively ~ e f  erred 
to as Semantic Knowledge ~ules), and finally Semantic Linking 
Strategies. They will occupy ue fn this order 
The Concatenation Rules take the semantic def in i t ion  o f  
the most recent input word and add it to the c u r r e n t  
preliminary semantic structure. For instance, (14) lists t h e  
semantic definitions (namely-for the ,  b6v.and laughed) which 
are relevant for the example in (13) above.

level components providing the syntac t ic  an& semantic components

almost certainly incorrect, and should be refined by making

VIt THE I S R  I SWANTIC KNOWLEDGE RULES 
Going baqk to Pig.2, the next step was the intermediate SR, 
which is ilerived from the preliminaPy SR by applying Semantic 
Knowledge Rules. namely Meaning Rules and Encyclopedic Rules. 
Meaning Rules deal w i t h  s t r i c t  impl icat io l i ,  while 3ncyclopedic 
Rules are typical ly  probabilistic. For instance, Keanfng 3ules 
tell us tha t  if somebody is a baker he must also be human and 
hence animate and hence concrete, e t c  ; w h i l e  Encyclopedic 
Rules t e l l  us t h a t  he - tends to wear whi te  c l o thes ,  tends to 
sell bread to people, and similar facts.  9 
f had stated earlier that speech involves using one's 
knowledge about the wor ld .  There are two separate problems 
w i t h  t h i s  kind ~f semantic knowledge: (1) how to code it! 
( 2 )  how to retrieve it. 
Coacerning t h e  f i n s t  problem, I assume encyclopedic 
8 ~ n  the present version of thd theory, the  semantic processor 
accept6 the  aemantic definition o f  a word o n l y  if t h a t  word 
has matched the syntactic predictions. It is probably desirahls 
to l i b e r a l i s e  t h i s  procedure so as to handle ungrammatical 
86QU6n216BB r 
9 The distinction between M-rule8 and E-rules is ak in  to Katz& 
~ o d o r ' ~ - ( 1 9 6 3 )  distinction between semantic markers and 
g i k t i n a u i s ~ ,  the main difference being that  Kate & Fodor 
information t o  be coded essent ia l ly  i n  the same form as the 
semantic representations themselves. This makes it easy to 
transfer to the encyclopedia informatior received in the 
cutrent d ia logue .  Such "active" information w o u l d  be added 
continuously t o  the "situational chapter" of the $ncyclopedia, 
where this chapter is thought of a3 containing The linguistic 
and non-linguistic context  of the current  utterance. 
Concerning the retrieval problem, it is clear t h a t  the 
information in the  encyclopedia must be extracted s e l e c t i v e l y .  
The solution chosen here i s  the one characteristik ~f networks 
Each Knowledge Rule is given an address, and each l ex ica l  
entry, as well as each Knowledga Rule, includes pointers to 
t h e  address of some o the r  relevant Knowledge Rules; Only tnose 
gules are ca l l ed  up which are associated with the sentence 
constituents through some pointer. 
In the case of Meaning 2ules t h i s  res tr i c t ion  seems 
su f f i c i en t ,  because there are only  f e w  for each lexi-cal entry. 
N o t  so in t h e  case of Encyclopedic R u l e s .  For instance, thebe 
are all kinds  of things I know about bakers --say, t h a t  they 
tend t o  wear white c l o t h e s  for work--, but most of which are 
irrelevant for understanding and verifying the  sentence1 
(18) T h e  bay was sold a n i c e  cake b y - t h e  baker. 
u s e d  features whereas I use meaning postulates@ For practical 
purposes, the m o s t  important aspect 'af the  d i s t i n c t i o n  is 
t ha t  M-rlxles are applied obligatorily, while E-rules are 
applied &electively, according to the intersection technique* 
( s e e  the  discussion below.)  Fot: a discussion and cr i t ique  of 
the ''featurelln approach, see Weinreich(l966). 
For instance,  the sentence is perfect ly  t r u e  even if the 
baker happened to be wearing a f lremanB s uniform whi l e  
selling the  cake to the boy. 
A good way of restricting t h e  number of Knowledge Rules 
called up for a given sentence seems t h e  Intersection 
Strategy (cf. ~ u i l l i a n ( 1 9 6 9 ) )  in (19) . 
(19) Intersection Stratemc 
If a clause contains  two  d i f fe ren t  constituents A and 3 
both pointing to the same encJIclopedic rule E, then c a l l  B e  
T h i s  r u l e  says to c a l l  up only  those  Encyclopedic i iules 
which are associated w k t h  a% least two constituents of t h e  
sentence. For instance, in (20) 1 
(20) This bread was eo'ld to John by t h e  I t a l i an  baker.  
baker. sell, and bread a l l  point  to t h e  same encyclopedic 
"patternw (21), which states t h a t  bakers t y p i c a l l y  s e l l  
baked goods to people4 
Hence, the Intersection Strategy Would c a l l  up t h i s  pattern, 
which could then be uaed to h e l p  i n t e r p r e t  t h e  sentence. But  
the rule  specifying that bakers t y p i c a l l y  wear  white c l o t h e s  
for work would not be called up  for sentence ( 2 0 ) ~  because 
only  the  constituent baker in t h e  sentence would point to 
t h i s  particular pattern. 
VIIt TAE FSAr SmANTIC LINKING ST2ATEGIES 
L e t  me return once more to Fig.2. The l a s t ~ C I l e - b l o c k  in 
this f igu re  was labelled Semantic Linking Strstegies .  They 
are responsible forrderiving t h e  final Sii, by assigning t h e  
appropri&tte semantic r o l e s  to various parts  of t h e  clauim. 
There are t w o  aspects  to t h i s #  clause-internal linking, and 
clause-to-clause linking. I would like to di scuss  clause- 
in te rna l  linking first .  
It seems to me t ha t  when we l i s t e n  to speech, we have 
a choice  of how much a t t en t ion  we pay to syntactic d e t a i l s .  
T h i s  is what Parallel Processing i s  a l l  about,  and it means 
that thsre are syntax-frse linking strztegies besides syntax- 
sensitive ones. ( 2 2 )  &ves a synopsis of t b a  linking strategies. 
(22) Semantfc Linking Strate~iees 
1. Linking by Variable Type 4. Canonical Order Strategy 
2. Pattern Matching 5 .  Syntax-sensitive 2ule 
3 . Contradiction Zlimination 6 .  "Alternative Linking" 
Types 1, 2, and 3 are  syntax-fre8. Type 4, the "Cxnanical 
Order"  stratecy (cf. ~ e v e r ( 1 7 7 0 ) )  relies on t h e  sha l lowes t  
aspect of syntax, namely s imple l i n e a r  order of t h e  major 
clalrse consit l lents .  Type 5 is nensi-f;ive to "functional" featllres 
occur r ing  in t h e  syntactic sur face  t r ee .  The 6th type, 
"Alternative Linking Strategies," will be explained l a t e r  on; 
t h e y ,  too, are p i ~ r e l y  semantic, Lh-gugh t hey  apply o n l y  a f ter  
t h e  syntax-sensitive ru le8  have appl i ed  (and failed). 
Nbw, w i t h i n  th i s  system of linking strategies, there see3  
to be different l eve l s  of detail. A t  the shallowest level we 
have Linking by Variable  Type. Pattern icatching requires 
more semantic de ta i l  1 and Contradfc~t ion  Elimination is sti 11 
more thorough. Furthermore,  thp syntax-free strategies rnay 
be assumed to be simpler than the  syntax-sensitive ones, 
because t h e  lat ter  must keep track of t w o  separate structures 
namely the semantic and the syntactic structure. I assume 
t h a t  t h e  strategies are ordered according to their re la t i ve  
simplicity, which would give us t h e  order as l i s t e d  in (22) 
Furthermore, I assume that once an acceptable reading 
has been derived f o r  a clause ,  application o f  f u r t h e r  
strategies in the hierarchy becomes o~ t ion t&.  This  of course 
is subject to empirical t e s t s .  For instance, Pattern Katching 
would interpret the  sentence: 
(23) The baker was sold some stale bread by the butcher. 
incorrectly as "the baker s o l d  the  butcher some s t a l e  bread. '' 
If application of further strategies is indeed optional, such 
sentences should sometimee be misinterpreted. 
There is in fact  some intuitive support for suck a position 
I 'think most of u% have experienced situations where a Slip of 
the Yongue like put the freezer in the turkev passed unnoticed 
atfirst. This ie moat naturally explained by assuming t h a t  the 
syntax never got a chance to apply to the sentence, due to the 
fact  t h a t  Pattern Matching resulted in an acceptable reading. 
Let me now di scuss  these  Linking Strategies in more d e t a i l .  
The first type was Linking by Variable Type, which is s t a t e d  
in (24). 
(24)  Linking by Variable T n e :  
(1) Link the head-variable of each SR-prefix to the 
INB-argument of t h e  a~oronriate t e  provided 
there is only  one eugn appropriate MVB-argument, 
and is not  already linked to some o t h e r  variahl A 
in the SR-matrix; 
(2) if Y is an Bvent-variable .I e then add - e=X,  where X 
is MVB plus i t s  modi f i er s  and arguments; 
( 3 )  if n is a predicate variable then substitute f o r  
F MVB and its arguments. 
L
This rule says to link t h e  "head-variable" ( L e a ,  the 
left-moet variable) of each pref ix  to the  PNB argument which 
matches its type. Opt ion  (2) spec i f i e s  t h a t  event-variables 
are linked to the event descr ibed  by t h e  main predicate1 and 
option ( 3 )  deals with certain adverbs l i k e  slbwlw or softlv. 
The rule will be explained usine the  example (25) .  
(25) (a) #Yesterday t h e  f a t h 5 r  of t h e  boy sang + #horribly 
# in the bath 4. 
(b) PSR: (THE~~:YSSTE&~~)[THEXI(TH~~:BOY~)(FATHERX~)J 
(E t2aPAST tZ) (E x*)(E P)(E e )  (TIIEZ: BATH%) 
E ~ I N c ~ ~ x ~ ~ ~  & HORRIBLY(?) & INez 1 
Looking at (25b), the  PSR f o r  sentence (25a), it can be 
seen that t h e  variables in t h e  prefixes a r e  of several 
different ty~es; there a r e  t h e  time-variables 4 and t2, 
individual-variables IC, y, 2, e t c  . , a predicate-variable ', 
and an event-variable The main verb (M3) is SING, and i t s  
arguments are a and Kow, time-variables can o n l y  be linked 
to other  tkxhe-variables, and these links have the s p e c i f i c  
form ~ E Y B  ("time-of-tne-YXB is included in tirne- 
of -the-prefix" ) , in our  cabe t~ c Cl. Next there  ie an 
individual-variable JC, which matches o n l y  t h e  ma-argument 
hence the link is x=x,m Then there is t h e  predicate-variable 
F which, according to option ( 3 )  of t h e  strategy, is rep laced  
- 
by iWB p l u s  i ts  arguments, yielding the combined reading -
H-(SIN G%nally,  the  event-variable p $s linked 
to t h e  entire event d e s c r i b e d  by the main predicate, namely 
t h a t  x2 sari(: horribly at t i m e  t21 p=tlO8RIBLY ( S I N G X ~ ~ )  T h i s  
exgands the matrix of (25b) i n t o  (26) , giving us, after 
simplification, the final 3R (27) f o r  (25a). 
The entire procedure is eyntax-free, with one qualificationt 
the constituent correepond1ng to the pain verb is marked in 
the semantic repreeentation by a oonresponding feature 
That is. SING in (25b) is marked as WVlulVB T h i s  syntactic 
feature is immediately copied f r o m  the syntactic structure 
i n t o  the semantic one$ where it is preserved until t h e  
entire sentence has been processed. 
For many constituent types, Linking by Variable Type is 
the o n l y  Linking Strategy that is needed. This is true 
p a r t i c l ~ l a r l y  for adverbs, temporal phrases like last Octbber , 
PrepP l i k e  into the garden, and auxiliary verbs l i k e  w i l l .  -
In addition, if a, clause has only one nuclear noun phrase, 
as 2s the case in sentence (25a), then the entire interpretation 
fs normal ly  taken care  of by t h i s  strategy# 
The next strategy was Pattern M*tching, which is stated 
in (28).  It says t h a t  if c e r t a i n  clause constituents match 
a pattern, then they are linked as in the pattern. 
(28)  Pattern Matching: 
(1: Let ( T I I P V ~ I A ~ V ~ ) ~ . . ( T Y ~ $ ~ A ~ V ~ )  Bvi...ve m 1 be a 
pattern c a l l e d  up by a PSR whose MVB is B ~ ~ ~ ( v ~ ~  'V n ) t  
(2 ) then f o r  each S2-pref ix head-variable ui matching 
exact ly  cne d e s c ~ # i p t i o n  A ov! in t h e  pattern, add J J  
a link U i = V j  (whsre V j  occupies  t h e  same argument-place - 
in B~~ as does v f  J in t h e  p red ica te  B of the pattern) 1 
for ui to match a description A j v j ,  t h e r e  m u s t  be 
an expression Ajui in t h e  ISR. 
For instance, pqlr e a r l i e r  example ( 2 0 )  r 
(20) This bread was s o l d  to John by the Italian baker. 
contains the constituents B R W ,  JOrIN, BAKER, and SELL8 They 
are linked in accordance with t h e  pattern (21), which stated 
fhat bakers typ ica l ly  sell baked goods to people. 3ere B R ~ A v  
in (20) matches (by implicatfon) BAKE~GOOD in (21), BAKER in 
(20) matches BAKZR Ln (21), JWN matches HUMAN, Bnd S W  
matches SELL. i iecall  that t h e  Intersection St ra tegy  in (19) 
debmines just which patterns a r e  cal led up far  a giben 
sentence. T h ~ r e  will usually o n l y  be a limited number of 
activated patterns, 
Next consider t he  Contradiction ~ l i m i n a t i o n  Strategy. 
An abbreviated verEIion o f  it is aiven in ( 2 9 )  Roughly, the 
rule %ests which roles each NP could play without leading 
to a contradicption, Then it checks  whether t h i s  would lead 
to a unique combined role assignment f o r  a l l  noun phrases, 
and if so, it accepts t h i s  combination as t h e  interpretation. 
( 2 9 )  Contratiiction Elimination Strateevr

v i  O C C U F ~  more than once ) ,  then  add t h i s  m-tuple of 
ZLnks to t h e  SR. 
A n  example is shown in ( 3 0 ) '  
(30) Tne cheese had been seen by the mouse.

FBR : ~ T H E X  :CHtEESEbc ) (THEY ~ B I O U S E ~ )  C SEEyx 2 
Notice t h a t  even though mouse, taken by i t s e l f ,  corrld 
be either logfcal  subject or ob jec t  of s e e ,  the combination 
mouse/cheese has a unique semantic relation to see, because 
cheese can of course only be log ica l  object of see. 
The ~ a n ~ n i c a i  Order Stratem is shown in (31). iioughly, 
the s t r a t egy  attempts to equate the surface order of t h e  
major clause oonatituents with ' t h e i r  "deep order I I 
(31) Canonical Order Stratenar 
(1) Let vl, .a,v rn ( m > l )  be prefix headvariables  of 
a single type T (where V i  precedes vj; f o r  i< j(m) , 
and l e t  ul,e.~,u, be type T argument places of MVB 
(where ui precedes u for i < j ~ n )  8 9 
(2) then each V i  not  yet linked to any matru-constituent 
is linked to the MVB-argument ui, unless MVB has 
the feature PASV in the syntactic structure. 
Far example, let ( 3 3 )  be t h e  preliminary SR of (32): 
(32) John gave t h e  c a t  some m i l k .  
Here the first three prefixes a r e  no t  yet linked to any 
matrix-constituent, and t h e i r  head-yariablee &, y, p, are of 
the same type. Hence they a r e  linked as in (34 ) ,  yielding, 
after simplification, the  f i n d  SR (35). 
Finally, 3 describes the svntax-sensitive rule. It i s  
seneuive t o  the fdature 3?Aw of the verb and l inks  the 
constituents marked S7Mr OBJl, 0BJ2, and AGenT to the main 
verb, insofar as this has not been done by earlier strategies.

V X I I  a DIFFEi3ENT XOD3S OF PROCESSING 
L e t  me interrupt here to consider t h e  prac t i ca l  problem 
of constructing an automatic sentence recognizer. Some aspects 
of the thapry I have j u s t  sketched may n o t  be optimal for a 
~omputational model, even though they seem appropriate for 
a psychological model .  For instance, to a pefson engaged in 
normal conversation accuracy of understanding is not  very 
crucial  most of t h e  t i m e "  Often, the  goal may only be to 
'-get the essentials," and if some mistake & s  made, it is 
simply corrected l a t e r  on. 
This "normal mode of processingw is what the psychological  
model sets out to describe.  Now, in the case of an artificial 
i n t e l l i ~ r t n c e  system, one would probably demand h i g h e r  accuracy, 
so as to minimize the need f o r  correctionsm T h i s  is, in some 
ways* similar to t h e  s i t u a t i o n  where you p u t  subjects in a 
psychulinguistic experiment. They usual ly  abandon the "normal 
mode of processingw very soon and instead employ the strategies 
that guarantee best performance for the s p e c i f i c  experimental 
task they are faced w i t h  . To give an example, consider the  
common type of experiment where a subject has to verify 
sentences l i k e  those in 138). 
(38a) 5 precedes 13. 
(38b) 5 is preceded by 13. 
( 3 8 4  13 is preceded by 5 .  
In o r d e r  to i n t e r p r e t  such sentences c o r r e c t l y ,  h i s  
knowledge t ha t  5 in f a c t  precedes 13 is of no help whatsoever 
to the listener, because true sentences occuf toge ther  w i t h  
false ones in this game. Therefore, he will soon drop all 
semantic short cuts --which he normally eaploys--  and 
interpret the sentences purely on the basis of their syntax. 
In a way, therefore, such experiments do n o t  rea l ly  t e l l  us 
anything about normal speech processing. 
Still, such conditions o'f heightened aecuracy may be just 
the onee we want to apply to the artificial i n t e l l i gence  
system. Let us therefore consider how such a non-normal mode 
of processing could be s inulated in our t heory .  
Now, looking back at the Linking Strategies in (22) above 
(~lnking by Variable Type, Pattern latching, C o n t r a d i c t i n n -  
Xlimination, Canonical Order, ana Syntax-sensitive M V B - ~ u l e ) ,  
there is indeed ar. obvious way of simulating the "high accuracy 
procedure," namely by dropping type 2, 3 ,  and 4 strategies. 
'Phese c o f l s t i t u t e  the " s h o r e  cuts" which work 90% of the t i m e ,  
but sometimes l ead  to misinterpretations. Notice that the 
result is still not a syntax-governed model, because most 
of the linking would s t i l l  be handled by the syntax-free 
ne'chod of Linking4by Variable Type, and syntactic btruc tare 
~ o u l d  s t i l l  be erased in clause-intervals, As a matter of 
fact, in this last respect I th ink  it is possible to g o  even 
further than I have done here, and erase syntactic s t r u c t u r e  
a f t e r  each major clause constituent (i.e., after each NP, 
adverb, or main verb), retaining only its functional feature, 
which is then simply integrated into the semantic representatbn. 
I have already done t h i s  here for the  constituent ~ a i n ~ e r ~ ,  
s o  in a way t h i s  woula o n l y  be a l og i ca l  extension of my 
proposal Looking at t h e  syntax-sensitive MVB-Rule ( 3 6 )  , 
it is evident that it rerers exactly to those functional 
features, namely SBJ, O B J 1 ,  O B J 2 ,  MVB, and AGT. 
It would seem, then, that even for purposes of artific ' ial  
in%ll igence ,  it  may be preferable to operate w i t h  a p a r a l l e l  
processing model ,  thereby minimizing t h e  size of the  syntactic 
gltructl~re and the amount o f  syn tac t i c  operat ions .  
Apart from this, I would like to argue t h a t  t h e  essential 
ingredients. of Pattern Matching and Contradiction-Elimination 
are still required for any adequaze t J l e o ~ .  W s - b r i ~ g  
back to the  sixth type of Semantic Linking Strategies, 
namely Alternative Linking Strategies. 
I X s W A L T E R N A T N E  LINKING STRATEGIES" 
Alternative Linking Strategies apply if t h e  normal 
strategies (types 1-51 have failed to produce a semantically 
acceptable reading. These strategies r e l y  heavily on the 
Semantic Knowledge Rules. 
The most important a n d  m o s t  general (and the only one to 
be discussed in the present paper) is the Obvious Connection 
Strategy in ( 3 9 ) .  It says, roughly, that  if a variable g 
cannot be linked to the R n B  then if the  encyclopedia contains

Xr CLAUSE-TO-CLAUSE LINKIKG 
For the remainder, 3: would like to discuss  clause-to-clause 
1Mcing. The d i e t i ~ l g u i s h i n g  feature of my proposal ,  a s  will 
10 See ~chank(1972) f o r  a dif ferent  approach to t h e  problem of 
recovering implicit information. He out l ines ,  f o r  instance, 
a method by which "I like books" would be expanded i n t o  the  
conceptual equivalent of "I like to read books." 
SchankDs theory is baqed on wconceptual casesw and lexical  
decomposition rather than meaning postulates. For instance, 
he claims that "John would be pleased by Il:ary8s going" is 
a proper part of the  meanhg of John wants Marv to come home, 
while  in my terms "John would be pleased by !daryw s going" 
is merely an allowable inference which may or may n o t  be 
drawn. Failure to Eraw an allowable inference explains t h e  
possibility of holding contradictory b e l i e f s  . For instance, 
somebody m i g h t  judge John's uncle left to be true ,  w h i l e  at 
the same t i m e  believing t h a t  t h e  brother o f  John's mother or 
father left was false, because he failed to apply t h e  
mean%% rule relating uncle and brother of mother or f a t h e r .  
It is difficult to see how a theory b a s e d o n  l ex ica l  
decomposition would explain such f&c ts Certa inly  , it w o u l d  
be unreasonable to claim that a person has not understood 
the sentence John's uncleJaft unless he a l s o  is aware of 
the synonymy relation between t h i s  sentence and the b r o t h e r  
of John's mother or father  Left 
be recal led,  is t h a t  s y n t a c t i c  structure is erased clause-by- 
clause. The problem,  t h e r e f o r e ,  is to show that sentences 
containing m o r e  than one clause can in fact  be interpreted 
correctly w i t h o u t  r e f e r r i n g  to t h e  full syntactic structure 
of any (completed) earlier clause.  
Consider first wPost-clauses" e ,  clause-final 
adverbs, temporal nouns, and preposition-phrases Tliey are 
already covered by the strategy of Linkillg by Variable Type 
discussed earlier. For instance, consider again sentence (25a). 
(yesterday t h e  f a t h e r  of t n e  boy sang horribly in the bath.)  
It contains  t h e  t w o  P08-b-clauses h o r r i b l y  and in the bath; 
and it was shown earlier how they are  linked to the main 
clalase by Variable  Type The only smtac t i c  information 
requ i red  f o r  t h i s  operation was t h e  marking of t h e  MVB in 
t h e  semantic representation* 
(41) indicates roughly how relative clauses are integrated. 
( ~ c t u a l l ~ ,  t h e r e  are some complications here, b u t  t h e y  a r e  
irrelevant to the  present discussion; the main point  here 
is t h a t  again no reference need be made t o  t h e  syntactic 
strracture of the f i r s t  c lause .  For d e t a i l s ,  see ~ e i m o l d  ( f  o r t h -  
comina  where coord ina te  c l auqes ,  comp&rison-clauses, and 
various s l ~ b j e c t l e o s  complement-clauses a r e  treated as well.)

(TMEX:GIRLX)[--~ and ( ~ y )  [ T 1 i ( E ~ y l  link, y-xj

Next consider circumstantial clairses l i k e  because the  
kan~aroo i u m ~ e d  in ( 4 3 ) .  The strategy for these c l a u s ~ s ,  
stat-ed in (42), does again not refer to t h e  syntactic 
structure of t h e  f i rs t  clause* 
(42) Circumstantial - Clause Ruler 
Substitute the matria of t h e  main clause f o r  t h e  free 
s-argument of the J U N C t o r  of the  circumstantial clause, 
and join the prefix of the  main clause before the  pref ix  
of the circumstantial c l a t ~ s e .  
(43) # The boy wap nappy $ (#  lbecause J U N C J  t h e  kangaroo jumped$) 
(THEIS : BOYX) [HAPPYX 1 and ( T H X ~  1 KANGA~)  CBEGAUSL ( Q ,JUMPY) 3 
"xJ ?' 
The same holds true f o r  complement-clauses like t h a t  t h e  
cake w a s  ~oisoned in (45). The corresponding strategy is 
given in (44) .  
(44) C o m ~ l e m e n t  Clause Ru1e.r 
Substitute the SR o f  t h e  complement-clause f o r  the  
free s-argument of the MVB of the main clause.

In sum, t h e  p r i n c i p l e  of clause-by-clause erasure of 
syntactic structure seems ihdeed compatible w i t h  t h e  
requirements of  clause-to-clause lirling. The exception i s  
t h e  feature MVB, and it was suggested earlier that this 
syntactic feature i s  integrated into the semantic representation 
Notice a l s o  that certain aspects of syntactic structure are 
reboverable from our semantic representations. For instance, 
the order of the  prefixes in the SR r e f l ec t s  the surface 
order of the NP'a of a clause. Hence, if certain constructions 
require access to such syntactic aspects, this i8 s t i l l  n o t  
incompatible with erasure of  syntactic structure in clause 
intervals.  or instance, coordinate clauses and certain 
subjectless complement clauses do often require identification 
of the surface subject .  For detailed discussion, see 
Reimold (forthcoming) . ) 
X - I  r THE "TEMPORAL SEQUENCE STEIATEGY " 
The last strategy discussed here concerns t h e  tense of 
consecutive clauses.  When we interpret sentences S1, 52 in 
a t e x t  or sentence conjunct, where S3, and S2 have the same 
tense, we of ten  assign a relative chrondlogy to the events 
described by these sentences. I will refer to the principle  
assigning such a chronology as the  Temporal Sequence Strategy. 
For example, consider (46) (Agatha Chris t ie ,  Thev came to 
Baghdad, pmlOO)t 
( 4 6 )  Then h i s  head jerkedtl back a little and he l a y  s t i l l .  
t2 
Assigning  PAST(^^) t o  the f irst  clause and  PAST(^^) t o  the 
conjoined clause in (46) does not account for actual 
comprehension: the listener knows that t2 is later than tl, 
even though there is no overt sequewe marker ( e  s g * ,  before,  
after, then) 
A s  a first approximation, the strategy might be sta ted  as 
f 011 ows t 
(47 ) Tem~oral Sequence stratem (preliminary) I 
Given t w o  main or conjoined clauses C1, C2 such t h a t  
C1 precedes C2 and t h e  t i m e  tl of C 1  has t h e  same 
"tense predicatew ( e . g . ,  PAST, FUTURE) as the  t i m e  t2 
of C 2 ,  then assume t h a t  DIRFRBC t p =  
(47) w i l l  require several modifications . F i r s t ,  the rule 
holds f o r  certain nan-tensed clauses as well, as illustrated 
by (48) (~hesr came- to Baghdad p 044) 8 
(48) Then he was o u t ,  across the Khan, back into the Suq. . 
The f u l l  interpretation of (48) must specify that t h e  t i m e  of 
o u t  precedes that  of acrcws, which in t u r n  precedes that of 
-
bacq. Since across and back had no overt tense predicate in 
7 
i48), the strategy must somehow be Liberalized to include 
S U C ~  C ~ S ~ S .  
In t h i s  connection, consider a l s o  (49)(~hey came to Baghdad. 
pa711 1 
(49) Never. I thought, would the  plane land. It went round 
and round*:! and roilndt,.  t 1 
If we assumed t h a t  tpt2=t3 in ( 4 9 ) ,  then the two 
conjoined phrases pnd round and round* should be redundant 
in the same sense in which Fido ia a dog and is a doe: and 
is a dog is. However, (49) can qui te  na tu ra l ly  be interpreted 
as " the  plane went-round and then round and then roundN 
b e . .  as 45. -DIRPREC t2 & _t3 DIRPREC t3). 
Next, t h e  Temporal Sequence Strategy seems blocked if 
some general semantic principles \in ~ a r t i c u l a r ,  Pattern 
Matching) suggest a chronology caR#licting with that imposed 
by the Temporal Sequence Strategy. For instance, consider 
a dialogue like (50): 
(50a) What's the matter with John? 
(50b\ Oh, he broketl h i s  a r m .  H e  f e l l t Z  off his bike. 
Here the second sentence in (sob) is interpreted as 
preceding the first sentence in (50b) temporally, counter t o  
what the Temporal Sequence Strategy would prediict. The reason 
is obviousr there is a perceived causal connection between 
the sentences, such that the second sentence describes the 
cause of the first. Since a cause must precede its e f f e c t ,  
t2 must precede tl in (50b). 
To formalize t h i s ,  we can make use of  Pattern ittcbing. 
For  instance, the encyclopedia would contain a pat tern  like 
(51), and there  would furthermore be a meaning ru l e  like (52). 
(52) (AU.,tl,t2) LCAUSE<A(. dl. a )  ,B(. at2. 43 IMPL tl CIRPREC t2 3 
We need only make sure t h a t  the pattern (51) is activated 
by the two sentences he broke his a r m  and he f e l l  o f f  h i s  bike 
in ( ~ o B ) ,  which can be- done by cal l ing up all patterns which 
a r e  in the intersection of the  main verbs of the two sentences. 
pa or instance, break and f e l l  both point t o  (51).) In e f f e c t ,  
we have to add t h e  fo l lowing  principle to t h e  Temporal Sequence 
Strategyr 
(53) Causal Connection Constraint: 
If C1, C 2  a r e  not conjoined by p d ,  c a l l  up a l l  
Encyclopedic Rules in the intersection of t h e  MVBVs 
of C1 and C2. If 4 DIRPREC tl is heuristically derivable 
from a pattern, then add t h i s  link tu C2 and do not 
apply t h e  Temporal Sequence Strategy. 11 
Another restriction seems to be that the  Temporal Sequence 
Strategy is inapplicable to proaess ive  tense. For instance, 
while tl must precede t, in ( 5 4 ) ,  they seem to be roughly 
- 
simi~ltaneous in (59, even though l i a t i n a  a c i ~ m e t t e  and 
leaving a room normally count as "instantaneous" events (see 
11 The condition against conjunction by and is necessary since 
pnd can never mean "and before tha t . . , "  For instance, 
a sentence like pe broke h i s  arm and fell of f  his bike .  
cannot be interpreted as "he broke h i s  arm because he 
fell off h i s  bike .  tB 
the "Short Events Principle" discussed below) 
(54) She lit a cigarette and l e f t  the room. 
tl t2 
(55) She was l ight ingt  a cigarette a n d  leavingt2 the raom. 
1 
progressive tense turns events i n to  non-instantaneous 
events. 
Finally,  I come to ?he m o s t  general and important 
r e s t r i c t i o n  on the Temporal Sequence Strategy, Phis r e s t r i c t i o n  
is of a subtle semantic nature:  it states that t h e  s trategy 
is applicable to clauses C1, C2 o n 1 ~  if the events 
described by C1 and C2 are unlikely to h e  simultaneous. 
Consider,  fqr instance, t h e  following sentence: 
(56) She j u s t  stood the re  and looked at h i m .  
It is perfectly poss ib le  f o r  someone to stand somewhere and 
at the  same t i m e  to l o o k  at somebody. Hence no temporal 
sequence is imoosed on stood and looked. By contrast, in (57) 
( ~ h e u  came to Baghdad, p.76)  wen3 and stood must be interpreted 
as seqyenced, since one .cannot at the s a m e  t i m e  a somewhere 
and stand somewhere elser 
(57) She wenttl out from the bar onto the terrace outside 
and stood% by the railing... 2 
Note that it will not do to d e f i n e . t h e  condition of 
"possible simultaneity' direc t ly  f o r  verbs. We cannot say, 
e . g . ,  t h a t  clauses containing stand and a must be"sequencad." 
For instance, in (58) and (5% stood and went w o u l d  be 
interpreted as simultaneous, the reason being, of course ,  
t h a t  different agents are involved, which makes simultanei-ty 
c onc e ivabl e . 
( 5 8 )  Jack stood by t h e  window. Jane went t o  the door. 
(-59) Jane went t o  the door. Jack stood by the  window. 
It is clear, then, t h a t  a d e t a i l e d  semantic analysis is 
need6d to determine "possible simultaneity of t w o  events. 
The principle can be s t a t e d  as f o l l o w s :  
( 6 0 )  possible Simultaneitv Constraint: 
C a l l  u~ allEncyclopedic Rules in the  intersection of 
the MVBms of. C1 and C2. Unless tl t2 is derivable 
(s t r icr t ly  or heuristically) the Temporal Sequence 
Stra tegy  is inapplicable 
There a r e  some cases, however, where two events are 
nocmally ihterpreted as sequenced, even though they could, 
stric-tly speaking, be sirnultaneous~ For instance, it is 
theoretically possible to l i g h t  a cigarette while g&tting up, 
and one certainly would not  want to add a rule  to t he  
encyclopedia stating t h a t  two such events are unlikely to be' 
sinnaltaneo~s~ Nonetheless, (61) is normally interpreted 
a8 sequences I 
(61) John got up and lit a cigarette. 
Aather than adding some ad hoc principle whlch somehow 
codes  the  intuition t h a t  it i s  awkward to s t r i k e  a match and 
hold it to the cigarette while geteing up, we can exnlain 
t h i s  as a consequence of a much more general heuristic 
principle. N o t i d e  t h a t  both clauses of ( 61 ) describe 
instantaneous events. Now, the shorter t d o  events, t h e  lower 
the probability t h a t  they coincidel For instance, the  
probability that the radio plays at t h e  same t i m e  when there 
is a- s ho t  is duch higher than the probability of t h e r e  being 
a s h o t  at the same time w i ~ h  a hiccough. A s  another i l l u s t r a t i o n .  
consider (62)(~hev came to B a a d a d ,  p. 72):  
(62) With a fatherly smile he withdrewel, Vic to r i a  sat down, 
2 
on the Ded and passed, an experimental hand over her hair. 
3 
Although it is Legically conceivable that  all th ree  events 
el-e3 happened simultaneous~y, t h e  n o r m a L  in~erpretation of 
these sentences takes them t o  be sequenced, because they a r e  
short and henca unl ikely  to coincide. 
This means, then, that we must add the  fol lowing heuris t ic  
principlm t 
(631 Sheet Events P r i n c u r  
If C1, C2  denote $nst$uvt@neous events e ,  JNSTANT tl 
and  STA ANT t2 a r e  derivable from M-rules and E-rules) 
assume tha t  tl#t2. 
In summary, the Tem:poporal Sequence-Strategy takes on the 
followinq form: 
(64) Tem~oral Seauenee ~trate~v(revised)t 
(1) Let C1, C2 be t w o  m a i n  or conjoined clauses such 
that CL is to t h e  l e f t  of C2 and the t i m e  tl of the

no tense predicate; and neither tl nor t2 has the
