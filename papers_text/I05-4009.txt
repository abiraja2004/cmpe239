Abstract
The Open-domain Question Answering 
system (QA) has been attached great 
attention for its capacity of providing 
compact and precise results for Xsers.
The question classification is an 
essential part in the system, affecting 
the accuracy of it. The paper studies 
question classification through machine 
learning approaches, namely, different 
classifiers and multiple classifier 
combination method. By using 
compositive statistic and rule classifiers, 
and by introducing dependency 
structure from Minipar and linguistic 
knowledge from Wordnet into question 
representation, the research shows high 
accuracy in question classification.  
1 Introduction 
With the rapid development of the Internet, the 
capacity of textual information has been greatly 
improved. How to acquire accurate and effective 
information has become one of the great 
concerns among Internet users. Open-Domain 
Question Answering System (QA) has gain great 
popularities among scholars who care the above 
problem (Li, et al 2002; Moldovan, et al 2003; 
Zhang, et al 2003), for QA can meet users? 
demand by offering compact and accurate 
answers, rather than text with corresponding 
answers, to the questions presented in natural 
language. Therefore, it saves users? great trouble 
to find out specific facts or figures from large 
quantity of texts.  
The study of Question Classification (QC), as 
a new field, corresponds with the research of QA. 
QC is an essential part of QA, for to correctly 
answer users? questions, the system has to know 
what the users are looking for, and it is QC that 
presents important searching clues for the 
system. QC can be defined to match a question 
to one or several classes in K category so as to 
determine the answer type. Every class presents 
some semantic restrictions on the answer 
searching, which serves QA with various 
strategies in locating the correct answer.  
The result of QC can also serve QA in the 
answer selecting and extract, which influence the 
performance of QA directly. The first reason is 
that QC minish searching space. For example, if 
the system knows that the answer type to the 
question ?Who was the first astronaut to walk in 
space?? is a person?s name, it can confine the 
answer in the names, rather than every word in 
the texts. The second reason is that QC can 
determine the searching strategies and 
knowledge base QA may need. For instance, the 
question ?What county is California in?? needs 
the name of a country as its answer, so system 
needs the knowledge of countries? name and 
name entities tagging to identify and testify the 
place name, while the question ?What is 
Teflon?? expects an answer in a sentence or a 
fragment, in the form of Teflon is <?. >. In fact, 
almost all the QA have the QC module and QC 
is the one of the most important factors what 
determines the QA system performance 
(Moldovan, et al 2003).  
64
At present the studies on QC are mainly based 
on the text classification. Though QC is similar 
to TC in some aspects, they are clearly distinct 
in that ? Question is usually shorter, and 
contains less lexicon-based information than text, 
which brings great trouble to QC. Therefore to 
obtain higher classifying accuracy, QC has to 
make further analysis of sentences, namely QC 
has to extend interrogative sentence with 
syntactic and semantic knowledge, replacing or 
extending the vocabulary of the question with 
the semantic meaning of every words.  
In QC, many systems apply machine-learning 
approaches (Hovy, et al 2002; Ittycheriah, et al 
2000; Zhang, et al 2003). The classification is 
made according to the lexical, syntactic features 
and parts of speech. Machine learning approach 
is of great adaptability, and 90.0% of classifying 
accuracy is obtained with SVM method and tree 
Kernel as features. However, there is still the 
problem that the classifying result is affected by 
the accuracy of syntactic analyzer, which need 
manually to determine the weights of different 
classifying features. 
Some other systems adopting manual-rule 
method make QC, though may have high 
classifying accuracy, lack of adaptability, 
because regulation determination involves 
manual interference to solve the conflicts 
between regulations and to form orderly 
arranged rule base.  
The paper combines statistic and rule 
classifiers, specifically statistics preceding 
regulation, to classify questions. With rule 
classifier as supplementary to statistic, the 
advantages of respective classifier can be given 
full play to, and therefore the overall 
performance of the classifier combination will 
be better than the single one. Moreover, as far as 
the QC task is concerned, the paper compares 
various classifier combinations, statistic-rule 
classifier, voting? Adaboost and ANN. To 
represent questions, the paper uses dependency 
structure from Minipar (Lin 1998) and linguistic 
knowledge from Wordnet (Miller 1995; Miller, 
et al 2003). In the following parts of the paper, 
classifying method and features is first 
introduced, and then comparisons are made 
between different type features and between 
feature combination methods. The comparisons 
are testified in experiments. The last part of the 
paper is about the conclusion of the present 
research and about the introduction of the further 
work to be done on this issue.  
2 Classifying Features  
In machine learning method, every question 
should at first be transformed into a feature 
vector. Bag-of-word is one typical way of 
transforming questions, where every feature is 
one word in a corpus, whose value can be 
Boolean, showing whether the word is present in 
questions, and which can also be an integer or a 
real number, showing the presence frequency of 
the word. In this paper, every question is 
represented as a Boolean vector.  
1. Bag-of-word: all lexical items in questions are 
taken as classifying features, because stop-word 
such as ?what? and ?is? playing a critical role in 
QC.
2. Wordnet Synsets: Wordnet was conceived as 
a machine-readable dictionary. In Wordnet, 
word form is represented by word spellings, and 
the sense is expressed by Synsets, and every 
synset stands for a concept. Wordnet shows both 
lexical and semantic relationships. The former 
exists between word forms, while the latter 
exists between concepts. Among various 
semantic relations in Wordnet, we choose 
hypernyms between nouns as our only concern. 
The classifying features are the senses of the 
nouns in the sentences and synsets of their 
hypernyms.  
3. N-gram: the model is founded on a hypothesis 
that the presence of a word is only relevant to 
the n words before it. The frequently used are 
Bi-gram and Tri-gram, and Bi-gram is chosen as 
the classifying features in the present research. 
Compared with word, Bi-gram model 
investigates two historical records, and reflects 
the partial law of language. It embodies the 
features of word order, and therefore it can 
reflect the theme of the sentence more strongly. 
4. Dependency 6tructure: Minipar is a syntactic 
analyzer, which can analyze the dependency 
relation of words in sentences.  It describes the 
syntactic relationships between words in 
sentences. Such relation is direction-oriented, 
semantically rather than spatially, namely one 
word governs, or is governed by, another 
concerning their syntactic relation. In one 
sentence (W1W2?Wn), compared with 
Bi-gram, Dependency structure concerns 
65
WiWj ? but not need limitation j= i+1. 
Obviously, Dependency Relation goes further 
than Bi-gram in language understanding. 
Dependency structure is specified by a list of 
labeled tuples. The format of a labeled tuple is as 
follows:
label (word  pos  root  governor  rel  exinfo ?)
 ?Label? is a label assigned to the tuple. If the 
tuple represents a word in the sentence, label 
should be the index of the word in the sentence. 
?Word? is a word in the input sentence. ?Pos? is 
the part of speech. ?Root? is the root form. 
?Governor? if the label of the governor of word 
(if it has one), ?rel? is type of dependency 
relationship, and ?exinfo? for extra information. 
Minipar output is represented by the word 
dependency relationship via ?governor?. Though 
only 79% of recall and some word relations fail 
to be analyzed, the accuracy reaches 89%, which 
guarantees that a large proportion of dependency 
relations from the output are correct. And the 
experiment proves that Dependency structure 
has more classify precision than Bi-gram as 
classifying feature. 
For example, as to the question ?Which 
company created the Internet browser Mosaic??
Minipar may produce the following results:   
E0 (()       fin         C    *   ) 
1 (Which  ~  Det   2  det  (gov company)) 
2 (company  ~   N  E0  whn   (gov fin)) 
3 (created   create   V   E0  i     (gov fin)) 
E2 (()  company  N  3 subj  (gov create)
 (antecedent 2)) 
??
According to the tuple, we can get 
dependency relationships between words in 
sentences. tuple 1 (Which ~  Det 2  det
 gov company) shows us the det relationship 
between ?which? and ?company? in the sentence.  
Therefore, we can get a words-pair?which
company? , and likewise other five pairs of 
words can be obtained ??company create??
? the Mosaic ? ?  (Internet Mosaic) ?
(browser Mosaic) ?  (create Mosaic), which 
will be the item of vector represented the 
question.
3 Classifying Method Description 
3.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
SVM is a kind of machine learning approach 
based on statistic learning theory. SVM are 
linear functions of the form f (x) = <w?x> +b, 
where <w?x> is the inner product between the 
weight vector w and the input vector x. The 
SVM can be used as a classifier by setting the 
class to 1 if f(x) > 0 and to -1 otherwise. The 
main idea of SVM is to select a hyperplane that 
separates the positive and negative examples 
while maximizing the minimum margin, where 
the margin for example xi is yi f(x) and yi ?
>-1,1] is the target output. This corresponds to 
minimizing <w?w> subject to yi (<w?x> +b) ?
for all i. Large margin classifiers are known to 
have good generalization properties. An 
adaptation of the LIBSVM implementation 
(Chang, et al 2001) is used in the following. 
Four type of kernel function linear, polynomial, 
radial basis function, and sigmoid are provided 
by LIBSVM . 
3.2 SVM-TBL QC Algorithm 
TBL has been a part of NLP since Eric Brill?s 
breakthrough paper in 1995(Brill 1995), which 
has been as effective as any other approach on 
the Part-of-Speech Tagging problem. TBL is a 
true machine learning technique. Given a tagged 
training corpus, it produces a sequence of rules 
that serves as a model of the training data. Then, 
to derive the appropriate tags, each rule may be 
applied, in order, to each instance in an untagged 
corpus.
TBL generates all of the potential rules that 
would make at least one tag in the training 
corpus correct. For each potential rule, its 
improvement score is defined to be the number 
of correct tags in the training corpus after 
applying the rule minus the number of correct 
tags in the training corpus before applying the 
rule. The potential rule with the highest 
improvement score is output as the next rule in 
the final model and applied to the entire training 
corpus. This process repeats (using the updated 
tags on the training corpus), producing one rule 
for each pass through the training corpus until no 
rule can be found with an improvement score 
that surpasses some predefined threshold. In 
66
practice, threshold values of 1 or 2 appear to be 
effective.
Therefore, we present compositive QC 
approach with rule and statistic learning. At first, 
questions are represented by Bag-of-word, 
Wordnet Synsets, Bi-gram, and Dependency 
structure, and are classified by the same samples 
and same SVM. Then output of SVM is 
transformed to the input of TBL, and thus every 
sample in TBL training data is featured by 
four-dimensioned vectors, from which a new is 
obtained as training data of TBL. When the 
errors produced in initial marking process are 
corrected in TBL to the greatest extent, a 
final-classifier is produced as follows (Figure1). 
  Figure1 SVM-TBL QC Algorithm 
TBL is composed of three parts: unannotated 
text, transformation templates, and objective 
function. In the experiment, unannotated text is 
obtained from SVM. The transformation 
templates define the space of transformations; 
here is combination of SVM output. Suppose we 
have k basic classifiers, and each classifier may 
put questions into N types, then we 
have rule templates. 
Objective function is the precision of classifier.

4 Results and Analysis 
The research adopts the same UIUC data and 
classifying system as (Zhang, et al 2003) shows. 
There are about 5,500 labeled questions 
randomly divided into 5 training sets of sizes 
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,500 
respectively. The testing set contains 500 
questions from the TREC10 QA track. Only 
coarse category is test. 
4.1 SVM Classifying Result 
We experiment the QC by SVM with four kernel 
function, and the following table (Table1) is the 
illustration of classifying accuracy by using 
single-kind classifying feature. 
It is shown that as to the four type features, no 
matter what Kernel is used, using Dependency 
relation feature have more precision than others 
and feature of Synsets is better than Bag-of-word. 
Therefore it is safe to draw the conclusion that 
Synsets and dependency relationship are helpful to 
represent questions. Among the four Kernel 
function, Liner has the best classifying precision. 
That is why we use Liner in the following 
experiment.

A question can be represented directly as a vector 
with multi-kind-features: Bag of Word, 
Dependency Structure, Synonym and Bi-gram. 
Figure2 provides an accuracy comparison of the 
results derived from classification with four 
features and classification with only one kind 
feature. Experimental result indicates that, results 
from classification with four type features do not 
excel the best classification precision with only one 
feature.
4.3 Using Adaboost to combine several 
classification results 
Multi-classifier combination is often used to 
obtain better classification results. Adaboost 
(Schapire 1997; Schapire 1999) is an effective 
classifier combination method. Yet in question 
classification training, chances of samples to be 
faultily classified are slim. Therefore, greater 
accuracy on classification can hardly be realized 
with Boost. 
4.4 Using BP to combine several classifiers 
We have also tried to use nerve network to 
combine the output results of 4 classifiers. We 
build a BP network with 4 input nodes and 1 
output node. The number of hidden nodes 
chosen comes from the empirical formula: 
m=sqrt(nl), whose ?m? indicates hidden nodes, 
?n? input nodes, and ?l? output nodes. Thus, the 
number of hidden layer nodes is ?2?.Figure3 
shows, when training samples are relatively less, 
classification accuracy of BP is greater 
compared to that of single-feature classifier, but 
not in cases where the number of samples 
increases.

Figure 4. Voting combine several classifiers
Through the method of voting, we can also get the 
combination results, according to the class label 
outputted by SVM with different type features. 
Experimental results are given in Figure 4. We may 
see that, due to the rule of ?more votes winning? in 
voting, when there are a number of not-so-accurate 
classifiers, the accuracy of voting can not compete 
with the greatest accuracy of a single classifier.

Figure 5. TBL combine several classifiers
Figure 5 displays the accuracy of a number of 
classification results in TBL combination. In our 
experiment, we construct 5 test-training sets, 
using 5500 sentences in UIUC. Each 
test-training set has 1000 stochastically chosen 
questions as its test set, and the other 4500 as its 
training. The TBL training set is built upon the 
SVM classification results from the test set. In 
comparison with the method to voting, TBL uses 
the conversion rule to fully rectify the errors of 
68
initial tagger. Therefore, TBL classification will 
not produce results inferior to the best results of

4.7 Result Analysis 
Compared to (Zhang, et al 2003) using ?tree 
kernel? as the classification feature, this thesis 
adopts the ?statistics and rules blended? method 
in QC (?statistics first and rules next?), lifting 
the precision of classification to 1.4% higher 
than it used to be. Moreover, it also avoids the 
problem of artificial selection in different feature
hting that appearing in =KDQJ?VSDSHU.
Tests using the ?statistics and rules 
blended? pattern of question classification 
unfold that, 34.1% of faulty classification of 
sentences arouses from the using of improper 
statistical methods. The manifest of this is that 
all the SVM classifiers with 4 features place 
questions into class ?i?, while they actually 
belong to class ?j?. Classification features that 
have relatively big differences are needed to 
69
work as basic classifier to improve the final 
result. And also, 31.8% of the faulty 
classification stems from the fact that, there are 
no corresponding rules in the rule sets derived 
from TBL training, so that the rule sets cannot 
correct the errors caused by wrong statistical 
methods. This may because our question corpus 
is Limited, and therefore, some of the 
classification combinations never even appear.

4&, an important module in the 4$ system, can 
conduct answer choosing and selection. This 
thesis experiment several different methods in 
QC, and studies features like the Dependency 
Structure, Wordnet Synsets, Bag-of-Word, and 
Bi-gram. It also analyzes a number of kernel 
functions and the influence of different ways of 
classifier combination, such as Voting, 
Adaboost?ANN and TBL, on the precision of 
QC. Adopting the ?statistics and rules blended? 
method of question classification (?statistics first 
and rules next?) and using language information 
such as the Synset from Wordnet and the 
dependency structure of Minipar as classification 
features promote the accuracy of question 
classification. TBL combination multi-classifier 
method can be extended, easily. As long as new 
classifying algorithm or new feature set is found, 
the classifying result from them can be 
transformed to rule set, which can lead to further 
classifying function. Wordnet has provided us 
with semantic relation, examples, explanation, 
etc. The present study only investigates the 
semantic relation of hyponymy. There are still 
much to be done in the future
