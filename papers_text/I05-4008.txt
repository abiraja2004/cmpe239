Abstract
Taiwan Child Language Corpus contains
scripts transcribed from about 330 hours
of recordings of fourteen young children
from Southern Min Chinese speaking
families in Taiwan. The format of the
corpus adopts the Child Language Data
Exchange System (CHILDES). The size
of the corpus is about 1.6 million words.
In this paper, we describe data collection,
transcription, word segmentation, and
part-of-speech annotation of this corpus.
Applications of the corpus are also
discussed.
1  Data Collection
Taiwan Child Language Corpus (TAICORP) is
a corpus of text files transcribed from the child
speech recorded between October 1997 through
May 2000. The target language is Southern Min
Chinese spoken in Taiwan.
1.1  Children
All fourteen children participated were from
Taiwanese-speaking families in Min-Hsiung
Villlage, Chiayi County, Taiwan.
There were nine boys and five girls, aged
from one year two months to three years and
eleven months at the beginning of the project.
More than half of the children were recorded
over more than two years.
1.2  Recordings
The recordings were made through regular
home visits. Spontaneous speech of these
children at play was recorded using Mini Disc
recorders. The interval of the sessions was
about two weeks. There were totally 431
recording sessions, each 40 to 60 minutes long,
totaling about 330 hours.
1.3  Transcription
Each recording session was transcribed into a
separate text file, using Chinese orthography.
For words that do not have a conventionalized
written form, the Taiwan Southern Min
romanization system, i.e., Taiwan Southern Min
Pinyin was used.
About half of the sessions (from children
under two and a half years old) also have
phonetic transcription in unicode IPA
(International Phonetic Alphabet).
The three primary transcribers, who were
also the investigators who did the recordings,
were well-trained linguists. All recordings were
first transcribed by the investigator of the
specific session and then checked by the other
two transcribers.
2  Text files in CHILDES format
TAICORP adopts the format of CHILDES
(Child Language Data Exchange System),
originally set up by Elizabeth Bates, Brian
MacWhinney, and Catherine Snow, to transcribe
and code the recordings of child speech into
machine-readable text (MacWhinney & Snow
1985, MacWhinney 1995).
The main components of CHILDES format
are headers and tiers.
 2.1  Headers
Obligatory headers are necessary for every
file.  They mark the beginning, the end and
the participants of the file.
Constant headers mark the name of the file
and the background information of the
children.
56
Changeable headers contain information that
can change within the file, such as the
recording date, duration, coders and so on.
These headers begin with @, for example:
Obligatory headers:
@Begin
@End
@Participants
Constant headers:
@Age of XXX:
@Birth of XXX:
@Coder:
@Educ of XXX:
@Filename:

2.2  Tiers
The content of a file is presented in tiers,
including main tiers and dependent tiers. A main
tier, indicated by *, contains the utterance of the
speaker.
Main tiers
The main tiers used in TAICORP include the
following:
??INV: the utterance of the investigator
??CHI: the utterance of the target child
??MOT: the utterance of mother
??FAT: the utterance of father
??SIS: the utterance of sister
??BRO: the utterance of brother
??GRM: the utterance of grandmother
??GRF: the utterance of grandfather
??OTH: the utterance of other people
The main tier is the most important tier
because it is where the utterances are listed. The
utterances in the main tier were transcribed in
the romanization (pinyin) system of Taiwan
Southern Min (to be explained and illustrated in
Section 5).
Dependent Tiers
Additional information is given in dependent
tiers, indicated by %, following the main tier.
Dependent tiers can be changed according to
the design and goals of each corpus.
The dependent tiers used in TAICORP
include the following:
%ort: transcription in standard orthography
%cod: part-of-speech coding
%pho: phonetic transcription in IPA
%ton: tone value in 5-point scale
For adults' speech, only %ort and %cod
tiers are used. For younger children's speech,
%pho and %ton tiers are also used. The
following text is an example from TAICORP.

3  Statistics of the corpus
The corpus size is about 1.6 million words
(more than 2 million morphemes/Chinese
characters). The number of utterances/lines,
words, mean length of utterances (MLU) are
listed in Table 1.
Lines Words MLU
Children ??????? ??????? ?????
Adults ??????? ????????? ?????
Total ??????? ????????? ?????
Table 1  Statistics of the corpus
It might be worth mentioning that the
MLU of adults in this corpus is relatively short.
This could be attributed to the nature of this
corpus as being child-directed speech.
4  Part-of speech annotation
Southern Min and Mandarin are both Sinitic
languages. They are very similar in their
morphology and syntactic structures. Therefore,
we adopted the part-of-speech coding system of
the Sinica Corpus, Academia Sinica, Taiwan
(see various CKIP technical reports). However,
among the 115 categories used in the Sinica
Corpus (CKIP 1993), only 46 codes were used
in TAICORP. In other words, categorization in
TAICORP is broader. These codes are listed in
Table 2.

5  Orthography-related issues for a
speech-based corpus of Southern Min
5.1  Romanization system
As mentioned in Section 2, utterances in the
main tier are transcribed in romanization
(Southern Min pinyin). The romanization
system used in TAICORP is the Taiwan
Southern Min Phonetic Alphabetic (also known
as Taiwan Language Phonetic Alphabet, TLPA,
originally proposed by the Taiwan Language
Society in 1991) announced officially by the
Ministry of Education of Taiwan in 1998.
5.2 Standard orthography: Chinese
characters
Chinese characters are used in the dependent
tier %ort as the standard orthography. This is a
reasonable way because most of the Southern
Min words are cognates of Mandarin words.
However, because Southern Min does not have
as conventionalized orthography as Mandarin,
quite a few words in Southern Min do not have
a consistent way of writing them. Some of them
don't even have very obvious corresponding
Characters.
In order to ensure consistency in the corpus,
Southern Min dictionaries were used. These
dictionaries are listed after the References.
This issue is particularly important for a
corpus based on spontaneous speech, rather
than written text. For example, the following
common words in Southern Min have to be
checked in the dictionary about their written
forms because they do not occur in Mandarin:
??!0bang2tah4/ "mosquito net"
?!/ban2/ "to pick"
?? 0ki5kha2/ "unusual"
If a written form cannot be found in one of
the major Southern Min dictionaries,
romanization is used.
Romanization is also used if the written
form of a word is found in the dictionary but
has so low frequency that it can't be found in
the computer coding system.
For homonyms, a number is added after
the character to indicate different lemmas.  For
example:
? 1 0kah4/!!"to cover with a blanket"
? 2 0kham3/!!"to cover"
? 3 0kua3/!!"a cover"
6  The Autosegmentation program and the
Spell-checker
In order to speed up the building of the corpus,
a word auto-segmentation program is necessary.
Yet, when the program is segmenting words
from the text, it can also deal with some related
problems at the same time, such as the
consistency of the transcription, adding
romanization, and expanding the lexicon.
The Lexicon Bank
As the basis of the auto-segmentation program
and the spell-cheker, a corpus-based lexicon has
been constructed which includes the lemma
(both in romanization and in Chinese
characters), alternative forms, synonyms, and
part-of-speech. (See the Appendix for a sample
of the lexicon.)
Consistency in the transcription
Taiwanese speech recognition is still developing,
so there is no way to transcribe the data with
machine.  Hence, transcription can only be
done manually.  The transcribers might be
inconsistent in choosing the written form. For
example, ??  (an3cuann2) "how" can be
transcribed as ??, ???, ??, ??, ?
? and so on. Therefore, it is very important to
design a program can identify the inconsistency.
When the program is segmenting the text,
it tries to match a string which matches the
59
word in the column of "Chinese character" in
the lexicon bank. It then segments the word and
codes its pinyin. Figure 1 shows the input text
in the frame, and Figure 2 shows the output of
after segmentation. Word segmentation standard
follows mostly that of the Sinica Corpus (Chen
et al 1996).
If the transcription happens to be one of
the "other forms," it will be replaced with the
standard form listed under the "Chinese
character."
Adding new words to the Lexicon
If a word does not exist in the lexicon, it will be
added to the lexicon after the file manager
confirms its status.
In short, the word auto-segmentation program is
able to do four things at the same time:
1  segment words in the text
2  code the pinyin for the characters
3  correct the inconsistent written forms
4  expand the lexicon bank
7  Applications of the corpus
This corpus has been used for studies on various
aspects of child language acquisition, including
tone acquisition (Tsay and Huang, 1998; Tsay,
Myers, and Chen, 2000; Tsay, 2001), consonant
acquisition (Liu and Tsay, 2000), classifier
acquisition (Myers and Tsay, 2000), final
particle acquisition (Hung, Li, and Tsay, 2004),
verb acquisition (Lee and Tsay, 2001; Lin and
Tsay, 2005), vocabulary acquisition (Tsay and
Cheng, in progress). More studies are on the
way.
Because this corpus is based on
spontaneous speech, it also has its applications
in addition to linguistic research. For example,
this corpus can be used in extracting important
speech features.
This corpus will be released by the
Association for Computational Linguistics and
Chinese Language Processing, Taiwan, in fall of
2005.
