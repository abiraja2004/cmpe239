Abst rac t  
Non-compositional expressions present a special 
challenge to NLP applications. We present amethod 
for automatic dentification ofnon-compositional ex-
pressions using their statistical properties in a text 
corpus. Our method is based on the hypothesis that 
when a phrase is non-composition, itsmutual infor- 
mation differs significantly from the mutual infor- 
mations of phrases obtained by substituting one of 
the word in the phrase with a similar word. 
1 Int roduct ion  
Non-compositional expressions present a special 
challenge to NLP applications. In machine transla- 
tion, word-for-word translation ofnon-compositional 
expressions can result in very misleading (sometimes 
laughable) translations. In information retrieval, ex- 
pansion of words in a non-compositional expression 
can lead to dramatic decrease in precision without 
any gain in recall. Less obviously, non-compositional 
expressions eed to be treated ifferently than other 
phrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLP 
methods. For example, an underlying assumption i
some word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Da- 
gan and Itai, 1994; Li et al, 1995; Lin, 1997), is that 
if two words occurred in the same context, they are 
probably similar. Suppose we want to determine the 
intended meaning of "product" in "hot product". 
We can find other words that are also modified by 
"hot" (e.g., "hot car") and then choose the mean- 
ing of "product" that is most similar to meanings 
of these words. However, this method fails when 
non-compositional expressions are involved. For in- 
stance, using the same algorithm to determine the 
meaning of "line" in "hot line", the words "product", 
"merchandise", "car", etc., would lead the algorithm 
to choose the "line of product" sense of "line". 
We present a method for automatic identification 
of non-compositional expressions using their statis- 
tical properties in a text corpus. The intuitive idea 
behind the method is that the metaphorical usage 
of a non-compositional expression causes it to have 
a different distributional characteristic than expres- 
sions that are similar to its literal meaning. 
2 Input  Data  
The input to our algorithm is a collocation database 
and a thesaurus. We briefly describe the process of 
obtaining this input. More details about the con- 
struction of the collocation database and the the- 
saurus can be found in (Lin, 1998). 
We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus 
with Minipar, 1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993; 
Lin, 1994), and extracted ependency relationships 
from the parsed corpus. A dependency relationship 
is a triple: (head type modif ier) ,  where head and 
modif ier are words in the input sentence and type 
is the type of the dependency relation. For example, 
(la) is an example dependency tree and the set of 
dependency triples extracted from (la) are shown in 
(lb). 
compl 
John married Peter's ister 
b. (marry V:subj:N John), (marry 
V:compl:N sister), (sister N:gen:N Peter) 
There are about 80 million dependency relation- 
ships in the parsed corpus. The frequency counts of 
dependency relationships are filtered with the log- 
likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). We call a depen- 
dency relationship a collocation if its log-likelihood 
ratio is greater than a threshold (0.5). The number 
of unique collocations in the resulting database 2 is 
about 11 million. 
Using the similarity measure proposed in (Lin, 
1998), we constructed a corpus-based thesaurus 3 
consisting of 11839 nouns, 3639 verbs and 5658 ad- 
jective/adverbs which occurred in the corpus at least 
100 times. 
3 Mutua l  In format ion of a 
Col locat ion 
We define the probability space to consist of all pos- 
sible collocation triples. We use LH R M L to denote the

frequency count of all the collocations that match 
the pattern (H R M), where H and M are either words 
or the wild card (*) and R is either a dependency 
type or the wild card. For example, 
? \[marry V:?ompl:N sister\[ is the frequency count of 
(marry V: compl :N s i s te r ) .  
? \[marry V:compl:~ *1 is the total frequency count of 
collocations in which the head is marry and the 
type is V:compl:hi (the verb-object relation). 
? I* * *l is the total frequency count of all collo- 
cations extracted from the corpus. 
To compute the mutual information i  a colloca- 
tion, we treat a collocation (head type modif ier) 
as the conjunction of three events: 
A: (* type *) 
B: (head * *) 
C: (* * modif ier) 
The mutual information of a collocation is the log- 
arithm of the ratio between the probability of the 
collocation and the probability of events A, B, and 
C co-occur if we assume B and C are conditionally 
independent given A:

Co l locat ions  
In this section, we use several examples to demon- 
strate the basic idea behind our algorithm. 
Consider the expression "spill gut". Using the au- 
tomatically constructed thesaurus, we find the fol- 
lowing top-10 most similar words to the verb "spill" 
and the noun "gut": 
spill: leak 0.153, pour 0.127, spew 0.125, dump 
0.118, pump 0.098, seep 0.096, burn 0.095, ex- 
plode 0.094, burst 0.092, spray 0.091; 
gut: intestine 0.091, instinct 0.089, foresight 0.085, 
creativity 0.082, heart 0.079, imagination 0.076, 
stamina 0.074, soul 0.073, liking 0.073, charisma 
0.071; 
The collocation "spill gut" occurred 13 times in the 
125-million-word corpus. The mutual information 
of this collocation is 6.24. Searching the collocation 
database, we find that it does not contain any collo- 
cation in the form (simvspilt V:compl:hl gut) nor 
( sp i l l  V: compl :N simngut), where sirnvsp~u is a 
verb similar to "spill" and simng,,~ is a noun sim- 
ilar to "gut". This means that the phrases, such 
as "leak gut", "pour gut", ... or "spill intestine", 
"spill instinct", either did not appear in the corpus 
at all, or did not occur frequent enough to pass the 
log-likelihood ratio test. 
The second example is "red tape". The top-10 
most similar words to "red" and "tape" in our the- 
saurus are: 
red: yellow 0.164, purple 0.149, pink 0.146, green 
0.136, blue 0.125, white 0.122, color 0.118, or- 
ange 0.111, brown 0.101, shade 0.094; 
tape: videotape 0.196, cassette 0.177, videocassette 
0.168, video 0.151, disk 0.129, recording 0.117, 
disc 0.113, footage 0.111, recorder 0.106, audio 
0.106; 
The following table shows the frequency and mutual 
information of "red tape" and word combinations 
in which one of "red" or "tape" is substituted by a 
similar word:

mutual 
verb object freq info 
red tape 259 5.87 
yellow tape 12 3.75 
orange tape 2 2.64 
black tape 9 1.07 
Even though many other similar combinations ex- 
ist in the collocation database, they have very differ- 
ent frequency counts and mutual information values 
than "red tape". 
Finally, consider a compositional phrase: "eco- 
nomic impact". The top-10 most similar words are: 
economic: financial 0.305, political 0.243, social 
0.219, fiscal 0.209, cultural 0.202, budgetary 
0.2, technological 0.196, organizational 0.19, 
ecological 0.189, monetary 0.189; 
impact: effect 0.227, implication 0.163, conse- 
quence 0.156, significance 0.146, repercussion 
0.141, fallout 0.141, potential 0.137, ramifica- 
tion 0.129, risk 0.126, influence 0.125; 
The frequency counts and mutual information val- 
ues of "economic impact" and phrases obtained by 
replacing one of "economic" and "impact" with a 
similar word are in Table 4. Not only many combi- 
nations are found in the corpus, many of them have 
very similar mutual information values to that of

nomial distribution can be accurately approximated 
by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993). Since 
all the potential non-compositional expressions that 
we are considering have reasonably arge frequency 
counts, we assume their distributions are normal. 
Let Ihead 1;ype modi f ie r  I = k and 1. * .1 = n. The 
maximum likelihood estimation of the true proba- 
bility p of the collocation (head type modif ier) is 
/5 = ~. Even though we do not know what p is, since 
p is (assumed to be) normally distributed, there is 
N% chance that it falls within the interval 
k_.4_ZN _ k.4_z N n ,~, 
n V n n n n 
where ZN is a constant related to the confidence l vel 
N and the last step in the above derivation isdue to 
the fact that k is very small. Table 3 shows the z~ 
values for a sample set of confidence intervals. 
"economic impact". In fact, the difference of mu- 
tual information values appear to be more impor- 
tant to the phrasal similarity than the similarity of 
individual words. For example, the phrases "eco- 
nomic fallout" and "economic repercussion" are in- 
tuitively more similar to "economic impact" than 
"economic implication" or "economic significance", 
even though "implication" and "significance" have 
higher similarity values to "impact" than "fallout" 
and "repercussion" do. 
These examples suggest that one possible 
way to separate compositional phrases and non- 
compositional ones is to check the existence and mu- 
tual information values of phrases obtained by sub- 
stituting one of the words with a similar word. A 
phrase is probably non-compositional if such sub- 
stitutions are not found in the collocation database 
or their mutual information values are significantly 
different from that of the phrase. 
5 A lgor i thm 
In order to implement the idea of separating non- 
compositional phrases from compositional ones with 
mutual information, we must use a criterion to de- 
termine whether or not the mutual information val- 
ues of two collocations are significantly different. Al- 
though one could simply use a predetermined thresh- 
old for this purpose, the threshold value will be to- 
tally arbitrary, b-hrthermore, such a threshold oes 
not take into account the fact that with different fre- 
quency counts, we have different levels confidence in
the mutual information values. 
We propose a more principled approach. The fre- 
quency count of a collocation is a random variable 
with binomial distribution. When the frequency 
count is reasonably arge (e.g., greater than 5), a bi- 
Table 3: Sample ZN values 
IN% 150% 80% 90% 95% 98% 99% I 
zg 0.67 1.28 1.64 1.96 2.33 2.58 
We further assume that the estimations of P(A), 
P(B\]A) and P(CIA ) in (2) are accurate. The confi- 
dence interval for the true probability gives rise to a 
confidence interval for the true mutual information 
(mutual information computed using the true proba- 
bilities instead of estimations). The upper and lower 
bounds of this interval are obtained by substituting 
k with k+z~v'-g and k-z~vff in (2). Since our con- n n n 
fidence of p falling between k+,~v~ is N%, we can 
I% 
have N% confidence that the true mutual informa- 
tion is within the upper and lower bound. 
We use the following condition to determine 
whether or not a collocation is compositional: 
(3) A collocation a is non-compositional if there 
does not exist another collocation/3 such that 
(a) j3 is obtained by substituting the head or 
the modifier in a with a similar word and (b) 
there is an overlap between the 95% confidence 
interval of the mutual information values of a 
and f~. 
For example, the following table shows the fre- 
quency count, mutual information (computed with 
the most likelihood estimation) and the lower and 
upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the 
true mutual information: 
freq. mutual lower upper 
verb-object count info bound bound 
make difference 1489 2.928 2.876 2.978 
make change 1779 2.194 2.146 2.239 
319 
Since the intervals are disjoint, the two colloca- 
tions are considered to have significantly different 
mutual information values. 
6 Eva luat ion  
There is not yet a well-established methodology 
for evaluating automatically acquired lexical knowl- 
edge. One possibility is to compare the automati- 
cally identified relationships with relationships li ted 
in a manually compiled dictionary. For example, 
(Lin, 1998) compared automatically created the- 
saurus with the WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) and 
Roget's Thesaurus. However, since the lexicon used 
in our parser is based on the WordNet, the phrasal 
words in WordNet are treated as a single word. 
For example, "take advantage of" is treated as a 
transitive verb by the parser. As a result, the 
extracted non-compositional phrases do not usu- 
ally overlap with phrasal entries in the WordNet. 
Therefore, we conducted the evaluation by manu- 
ally examining sample results. This method was 
also used to evaluate automatically identified hy- 
ponyms (Hearst, 1998), word similarity (Richardson, 
1997), and translations of collocations (Smadja et 
al., 1996). 
Our evaluation sample consists of 5 most frequent 
open class words in the our parsed corpus: {have, 
company, make, do, take} and 5 words whose fre- 
quencies are ranked from 2000 to 2004: {path, lock, 
resort, column, gulf}. We examined three types of 
dependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun, 
and adjective-noun. A total of 216 collocations were 
extracted, shown in Appendix A. 
We compared the collocations in Appendix A with 
the entries for the above 10 words in the NTC's 
English Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID) 
(Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains ap- 
proximately 6000 definitions of idioms. For our eval- 
uation purposes, we selected the idioms in NTC-EID 
that satisfy both of the following two conditions: 
(4) a. the head word of the idiom is one of the 
above 10 words. 
b. there is a verb-object, noun-noun, or 
adjective-noun relationship in the idiom 
and the modifier in the phrase is not a 
variable. For example, "take a stab at 
something" is included in the evaluation, 
whereas "take something at face value" is 
not. 
There are 249 such idioms in NTC-EID, 34 of which 
are also found in Appendix A (they are marked with 
the '+' sign in Appendix A). If we treat the 249 en- 
tries in NTC-EID as the gold standard, the precision 
and recall of the phrases in Appendix A are shown in 
Table 4, To compare the performance with manually 
compiled ictionaries, we also compute the precision 
and recall of the entries in the Longman Dictionary 
of English Idioms (LDOEI) (Long and Summers, 
1979) that satisfy the two conditions in (4). It can 
be seen that the overlap between manually compiled 
dictionaries are quite low, reflecting the fact that dif- 
ferent lexicographers may have quite different opin- 
ion about which phrases are non-compositional. 
Precision Recall Parser Errors 
Appendix A 15 .7% 13.7% 9.7% 
LDOEI 39.4% 20.9% N.A. 
Table 4: Evaluation Results 
The collocations in Appendix A are classified into 
three categories. The ones marked with '+' sign 
are found in NTC-EID. The ones marked with 'x '  
are parsing errors (we retrieved from the parsed cor- 
pus all the sentences that contain the collocations in
Appendix A and determine which collocations are 
parser errors). The unmarked collocations atisfy 
the condition (3) but are not found in NTC-EID. 
Many of the unmarked collocation are clearly id- 
ioms, such as "take (the) Fifth Amendment" and 
"take (its) toll", suggesting that even the most com- 
prehensive dictionaries may have many gaps in their 
coverage. The method proposed in this paper can 
be used to improve the coverage manually created 
lexical resources. 
Most of the parser errors are due to the incom- 
pleteness of the lexicon used by the parser. For ex- 
ample, "opt" is not listed in the lexicon as a verb. 
The lexical analyzer guessed it as a noun, causing 
the erroneous collocation "(to) do opt". The col- 
location "trig lock" should be "trigger lock". The 
lexical analyzer in the parser analyzed "trigger" as 
the -er form of the adjective "trig" (meaning well- 
groomed). 
Duplications in the corpus can amplify the effect 
of a single mistake. For example, the following dis- 
claimer occurred 212 times in the corpus. 
"Annualized average rate of return after ex- 
penses for the past 30 days: not a forecast 
of future returns" 
The parser analyzed '% forecast of future returns" 
as \[S \[NP a forecast of future\] \[VP returns\]\]. As a 
result, ( return V:subj :N forecast)  satisfied the 
condition (3). 
Duplications can also skew the mutual informa- 
tion of correct dependency relationships. For ex- 
ample, the verb-object relationship between "take" 
and "bride" passed the mutual information filter be- 
cause there are 4 copies of the article containing this 
phrase. If we were able to throw away the duplicates 
and record only one count of "take-bride", it would 
have not pass the mutual information filter (3). 
320 
The fact that systematic parser errors tend to 
pass the mutual information filter is both a curse 
and a blessing. On the negative side, there is 
no obvious way to separate the parser errors from 
true non-compositional expressions. On the positive 
side, the output of the mutual information filter has 
much higher concentration of parser errors than the 
database that contains millions of collocations. By 
manually sifting through the output, one can con- 
struct a list of frequent parser errors, which can then 
be incorporated into the parser so that it can avoid 
making these mistakes in the future. Manually go- 
ing through the output is not unreasonable, because 
each non-compositional expression has to be individ- 
ually dealt with in a lexicon anyway. 
To find out the benefit of using the dependency 
relationships identified by a parser instead of simple 
co-occurrence r lationships between words, we also 
created a database of the co-occurrence r lationship 
between part-of-speech tagged words. We aggre- 
gated all word pairs that occurred within a 4-word 
window of each other. The same algorithm and simi- 
larity measure for the dependency database are used 
to construct a thesaurus using the co-occurrence 
database. Appendix B shows all the word pairs that 
satisfies the condition (3) and that involve one of 
the 10 words {have, company, make, do, take, path, 
lock, resort, column, gulf}. It is clear that Appendix 
B contains far fewer true non-compositional phrases 
than Appendix A. 
7 Re la ted  Work  
There have been numerous previous research on ex- 
tracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Choueka, 
1988) and (Smadja, 1993). They do not, however, 
make a distinction between compositional nd non- 
compositional collocations. Mutual information has 
often been used to separate systematic associations 
from accidental ones. It was also used to compute 
the distributional similarity between words CHin -
dle, 1990; Lin, 1998). A method to determine the 
compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in 
(Tapanainen et al, 1998). The basic idea in there 
is that "if an object appears only with one verb (of 
few verbs) in a large corpus we expect hat it has an 
idiomatic nature" (Tapanainen et al, 1998, p.1290). 
For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al, 1998) 
computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank 
the non-compositionality of o according to this value. 
Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o) 
is computed as follows: 
DF(o) = ~ Iv,, v:compl:~, ol a 
n b 
i=1 
where {vl,v2,... ,vn} are verbs in the corpus that 
took o as the object and where a and b are constants. 
The first column in Table 5 lists the top 40 verb- 
object pairs in (Tapanainen et ai., 1998). The "mi" 
column show the result of our mutual information 
filter. The '+'  sign means that the verb-object pair 
is also consider to be non-compositional according 
to mutual information filter (3). The '-' sign means 
that the verb-object pair is present in our depen- 
dency database, but it does not satisfy condition (3). 
For each '-' marked pairs, the "similar collocation" 
column provides a similar collocation with a similar 
mutual information value (i.e., the reason why the 
pair is not consider to be non-compositional). The 
'<>' marked pairs are not found in our collocation 
database for various reasons. For example, "finish 
seventh" is not found because "seventh" is normal- 
ized as "_NUM", "have a go" is not found because 
"a go" is not an entry in our lexicon, and "take ad- 
vantage" is not found because "take advantage of" 
is treated as a single lexical item by our parser. The 
~/marks in the "ntc" column in Table 5 indicate 
that the corresponding verb-object pairs is an idiom 
in (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993). It can be seen 
that none of the verb-object pairs in Table 5 that 
are filtered out by condition (3) is listed as an idiom 
in NTC-EID. 
8 Conc lus ion  
We have presented a method to identify non- 
compositional phrases. The method is based on the 
assumption that non-compositionai phrases have a 
significantly different mutual information value than 
the phrases that are similar to their literal mean- 
ings. Our experiment shows that this hypothesis i
generally true. However, many collocations resulted 
from systematic parser errors also tend to posses this 
property.
