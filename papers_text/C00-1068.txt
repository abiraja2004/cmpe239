In a st)oken dialogu(: system, it fr(:(tuently o(:-

utterances and the user makes exl)ressions the 
system has not (~xt)ccted. These prot)lcms arc 
essentially incvital)le in handling the natural 
language 1)y comlmters , even if vocal)ulary and 
grammar of the system are |~lmed. This lack of 
robustness i one of the reason why spoken dia- 
logue systems have not been widely deployed. 
In order to realize a rol)ust st)oken dialogue 
system, it is inevital)le to handle speech recog- 
nition errors. To sut)t)ress recognition errors, 
system-initiative dialogue is eitbctive. But it 
ca.n 1)e adopted only in a simi)le task. For in- 
stance, the form-tilling task can 1)e realized 1)y a 
simi)le strategy where the system asks a user the 
slut wdues in a fixed order. In such a systeln- 
initiated intera('tion, the recognizer easily nar- 
rows down the vocabulary of the next user's ut- 
tcrance, thus the recognition gets easier.

works have, shown that confirmation strategy 
shouM 1)c decided according to the frequency of 
stretch recognition errors, using mathematicml 
formula (Niimi and Kolmymshi, 1.996) and using 
comt)uter-to-comlml;er silnulation (W~tanabe et 
al., 1!)98). These works assume tixe(t l)erfof 
mance (averaged speech recognition accuracy) 
in whole (lialogue with any speakers. For flex- 
ible dialogue management, howeve, r the confir- 
mation strategy luust 1)e dynamically changc, d 
bmsed on the individual utterances. For in- 
stmncc, we human make contirmation only when 
we arc not coat|dent. Similarly, confidence, inca- 
sures (CMs) of every speech recognition output 
should be modeled as a criterion to control dia- 
logue management. 
CMs have been calculated in previous works 
using transcripts and various knowledge sources 
(Litman et al, 1999) (Pao et, al., 1998). For 
more tlexible interaction, it, ix desirable that 
CMs are detined on each word rather than whole 
sentence, because the systeln can handle only 
unreliable portions of an utterance instead of 
accepting/rejecting whole sentence. 
467 
In this paper, we propose two concept-level 
CMs that are on content-word level and on 
semantic-attribute level for every content word. 
Because the CMs are defined using only speech 
recognizer output, they can be computed in real 
time. The system can make efficient confir- 
mation and effective guidance according to the 
CMs. Even when successful interpretation is 
not obtained o51 content-word level, the system 
generates ystem-initiative guidances based on 
the semantic-attribute level, which lead the next 
user's utterance to successful interpretation. 
2 Def in i t ion  o f  Conf idence  Measures  
(CMs) 
Confidence Measures (CMs) have been studied 
for utterance verification that verifies speech 
recognition result as a post-processing (Kawa- 
hara et al, 1998). Since an automatic speech 
recognition is a process finding a sentence hy- 
pothesis with the maximum likelihood for an 
input speech, some measures are needed in or- 
der to distinguish a correct recognition result 
from incorrect one. In this section, we de- 
scribe definition of two level CMs which are on 
content-words and on semantic-attritmtes, us- 
ing 10-best output of the speech recognizer and 
parsing with phrase-level grammars. 
2.1 Def init ion of  CM for Content Word 
In the speech recognition process, both acoustic 
probability and linguistic t)robability of words 
are multiplied (summed up in log-scale) over 
a sentence, and the sequence having maximum 
likelihood is obtained by a search algorithm. A 
score of sentence derived from the speech rec- 
ognizer is log-scaled likelihood of a hypothesis 
sequence. We use a grammar-based speech rec- 
ognizer Julian (Lee et al, 1999), which was de- 
veloped in our laboratory. It correctly obtains 
the N-best candidates and their scores by using 
A* search algorithm. 
Using the scores of these N-best candidates, 
we calculate content-word CMs as below. The 
content words are extracted by parsing with 
phrase-level grammars that are used in speech 
recognition process. In this paper, we set N = 
10 after we examined various values of N as the 
nmnber of computed candidates J 
1Even if we set N larger tt,an 10, the scores of i-th 
hypotheses (i > 10) are too small to affect resulting CMs. 
First, each i-th score is multiplied by a factor 
a (a  < 1). This factor smoothes tile difference 
of N-best scores to get adequately distributed 
CMs. Because the distribution of the abso- 
lute values is different among kinds of statisti- 
cal acoustic model (monophone, triphone, and 
so oi1), different values must be used. The value 
of c~ is examined in the preliminary experiment. 
In this paper, we set c~ = 0.05 when using tri- 
phone model as acoustic model. Next, they are 
transtbrnmd from log-scaled value (<t. scaledi) 
to probability dimension by taking its exponen- 
tial, and calculate a posteriori probability tbr 
each i-th candidate (Bouwman et al, 1999). 
e~.scaledi 
Pi = ~n Co~.scaledj j=l 
This Pi represents a posteriori probability of the 
i-th sentence hypothesis. 
Then, we compute a posteriori probability tbr 
a word. If the i-th sentence contains a word w, 
let 5w,i = 1, and 0 otherwise. A posteriori prob- 
ability that a word w is contained (Pw) is de- 
rived as summation of a posteriori prob~bilities 
of sentences that contain the word. 
/L 
Pw = ~ Pi " 5w,i 
i=1  
We define this Pw as the content-word CM 
(CM,,). This CM.,, is calculated tbr every con- 
tent word. Intuitively, words that appear many 
times in N-best hypotheses get high CMs, and 
frequently substituted ones in N-best hypothe- 
ses are judged as mn'eliable. 
In Figure 1, we show an example in CMw 
calculation with recognizer outputs (i-th recog- 
nized candidates and their a posteriori proba- 
bilities) tbr an utterance "Futaishisctsu ni rcsu- 
toran no aru yado (Tell me hotels with restau- 
rant facility.)". It can be observed that a correct 
content word 'restaurant as facility' gets a high 
CM value (CMw = 1). The others, which are 
incorrectly recognized, get low CMs, and shall 
be rejected. 
2.2 CM for Semant ic  At t r ibute  
A concept category is semantic attribute as- 
signed to content words, and it is identified 
by parsing with phrase-level gramnmrs that are 
used in speech recognition process and repre- 
sented with Finite State Automata (FSA). Since

these FSAs are, classified into (:on(:cl)t categories 
lmforehand, we can auton|atically derive the 
concept categories of words by parsing with 
these grammars. In our hotel query task, there 
are sevelt concept categories uch as qocation', 
'fi, cility' and so on. 
For this concept (:ategory, we also de- 
fine semantic-attritmtc CMs (CM~:) as tbllows. 
First, we (-ah:ulnte a t)osteriori probabilities of 
N-best sentences in the same. way of comtmt- 
ing content-word CM. If a concel)t c~tegory c is 
contained in the i-th sentence, let 5,,,i = 1, and 0 
otherwise. The t)robability that a concept cat- 
egory c is correct (Pc) is derived as below. 
Pc = E pi ' sc,i 
i=1 
We define this Pc as semantic-attribute CM 
(CM~). This CMc estimates which category the 
user refers to and is used to generate tt'ective 
guidances.

3 Mixed-initiative Dialogue Strategy 
using CMs 
There m:e a lot of systems that hawe a(lopted 
a mixed-initiative strategy (Sturm et al, 
1999)(Goddeau et a.l., 1996)(Bennacef e.t al., 
1996). It has several adwmtages. As the. sys- 
tems do not impose rigid system-initiated tem- 
plates, the user can input values he has in 
mind directly, thus the dialogue l)ecomes more 
natural. In conventional systems, the system- 
initiated utterances are considered only when 
semantic mnbiguity occurs. But in order to re- 
alize robust interaction, the system should make 
confirmations to remove recognition errors and 
generate guidances to lead next user's utterance 
to succcssflll interpretation. In this section, we 
describe how to generate the system-initiated 
utterances to deal with recognition errors. An 
overview of our strategy is shown in Figure 2. 
3.1 Making Ef fect ive Conf i rmat ions  
Confidence Measure (CM) is useflll in selecting 
reliable camlidates and controlling coniirnlation 
strategy. By setting two thresholds 01,02(01 > 
0~) on content-word CM (CM.,), we provide the 
confirmation strategy as tbllows. 
469 
? C-Mw > 0~ 
accept the hypothesis 
? Oj >_CM~>02 
-~ make confirmation to the user 
"Did you say ...?" 
? 02 >_ CM~,, 
--* reject the hypothesis 
The. threshold 01 is used to judge whether the 
hypothesis is accepted or should be confirmed, 
and tile threshold 02 is used to judge whether it 
is reiected. 
Because UMw is defined for every content 
word, judgment among acceptance, confirma- 
tion, or rejection is made for every content 
word when one utterance contains several con- 
tent words. Suppose in a single utterance, one 
word has CM,,,, between 0~ and 0~ and tile other 
has t)elow 02, the tbrlner is given to confirma- 
tion process, and tile latter is rejected. Only if 
all content words are rejected, the system will 
prompt the user to utter again. By accepting 
confident words and rejecting mlreliable candi- 
dates, this strategy avoids redundant confirma- 
tions and tbcuses on necessary confirmation. 
We optinfize these thresholds 0t, 02 consider- 
tug the false, acceptance (FA) and the false re- 
jection (FR) using real data. 
Moreover, the system should confirm using 
task-level knowledge. It is not usual that users 
change the already specified slot; values. Thus, 
recognition results that overwrite filled slots are 
likely to be errors, even though its CM~, is high. 
By making confirmations ill such a situation, it 
is expected that false acceptance (FA) is sup- 
pressed. 
3.2  Generat ing  System- In l t ia ted  
Gu idanees  
It is necessary to guide tile users to recover ti'om 
recognition errors. Especially for novice users, 
it is often eflbctive to instruct acceptable slots 
of the system. It will be helpful that tile system 
generates a guidance about the acceptable slots 
when the user is silent without carrying out tile 
dialogue. 
The system-initiated guidances are also effec- 
tive when recognition does not go well. Even 
when any successflfl output of content words is 
not obtained, the system cast generate ffective 
guidances based on the semantic attribute with 
f

Figure 3: Example of high semantic attribute 
confidence in spite of low word confidence 
high confidence. An example is shown in Fig- 
ure 3. In this example, all the 10-best candi- 
dates are concerning a name of place but their 
CMw values are lower than the threshold (02). 
As a result, any word will be neither accepted 
nor confirmed. In this case, rather than re- 
jecting the whole sentence and telling the user 
"Please say again", it; is better to guide the user 
based oll the attr ibute having high CM,. ,  such 
as "Which city is your destination?". This guid- 
ance enables tile system to narrow down the 
vocabulary of the next user's utterance and to 
reduce the recognition difficulty. It will conse- 
quently lead next user's utterance to successful 
interpretation. 
When recognition on a content word does not 
470 
go well repeatedly in spite of high semanti(:- 
attr ibute CM, it is reasoned that the content 
word may be out-ofvocalmlary, in such a case, 
the systmn shouht change the que.stion. For 
example, if an uttermme coal;alas all out-of  
vocat)ulary word and its semantic-attribute is 
inibrred as "location", the system can make 
guidance, "Please st)eci(y with the name of t)re- 
fecture", which will lead the next user's utter- 
ance into the system's vocabulary. 
4 Exper imenta l  Eva luat ion  
4.1 Task and Data  
We evaluate our nmthod on the hotel query 
task. We colh;cted 120 mimll;es speech data by 
24 novice users l)y using the 1)rototylm system 
with GUI (Figure 4) (Kawahara et al, 1999). 
The users were given siml)le instruction before- 
hand oll the system's task, retriewfi)le il;(nns, 
how to cancel intmt values, and so o11. The data 
is segmented into 705 utterances, with a t)ause 
of 1.25 seconds. The voeal)ulary of I;he system 
contains 982 words, and the aural)or of database 
records is 2040. 
()tit of 705 lltterailces, \]24 llttelTallces (1.7.6%) 
are beyond the system's eal)al)ility , namely they 
are out-ofvocalmlary, ou|;-ofgrmnmar~ out-of

1)erim(mt;s, we cvahmte th(', sys|;t',ln \])erl))rm~nce 
using all (lath including these mm,c(:el)tnt)le ut- 
terances in order to evahlalt;e how the system 
can reject unexl)ected utterances at)t)rot)riately 
as well as recognize hernial utterances correctly. 
4.2 Thresho lds  to Make Conf i rmat ions 
In section 3.1, we t)resented confirmation strat- 
egy 1)y setting two thresholds 01,02 (01 > 02) for 
eolfl, enl;-word CM (CMw). We optinlize these 
threshoht wflues using t;11(; collected data. \?e 
count ca:ors 11ol; by the utterance lint by the 
content-word (slot). The number of slots is 804. 
The threshold 01 decides t)etween accel)tanee 
and confirmation. The wdue of 0\] shouhl be 
determined considering both the ratio of ineof  
rectly accepting recognition errors (False At-- 
ceptance; FA) and the ratio of slots that are 
not filh;d with correct wfiues (Slot; Error; SErr). 
Namely, FA and SErr are defined an the (:(mq)le- 
meats of t)recision and recall rate of the outl)ltt , 
respectively. 
FA = ~ el' incorrectly accepted words 
of accepted words 
fl~ of correet;ty aecel)ted words 
SE'rr = I - 
of all correct words 
After experimental optimization to minimize 
FA+SErr, we derive a wflue of 0i as 0.9. 
Similarly, the threshold 02 decides contirlna- 
tion and rejection. The value of 02 should be 
decided considering both the ratio of incorrectly 
rqjeeting content words (False Rejection; FR) 
and the ratio of aceel)ting recognition errors into 
the eonfirlnation 1)recess (conditional False At:- 
eel)tahoe; cFA). 
fl: of incorrectly re.jetted words 
~- of all rejected words 
If we set the threshohl 02 lower, FR de- 
creases and correspondingly cFA increases, 
which means that more candidates are ol)tained 
but more eontirmations are needed. By mini- 
m izing \]q/.+cFA, we deriw; a value of 02 as 0.6. 
4.3 Compar i son  w i th  Convent iona l

only 1-best candidate of a speech recognizer 
outt)ut is used in the subsequent processing.

method that uses only 1-best ean(lidate in in-

%rifle 1. 
1111 the qlo eonfirnlation' strategy, the hy- 
pothes(,s are classified by a single threshohl (0) 
into either the accepted or the rejected. Namely, 
(:ontent words having CM,,, over threshohl 0 are 
aecet)ted, mM otherwise siml)ly r(\[iected. In this 
case, a 1;hreshold wflue of 0 is set to 0.9 that 
gives miniature FA-FSErr. 111 the 'with con- 
firmation' strategy~ the proposed (:oniirmation 
strategy is adol)ted using ()1 and 02. We set 
01 = 0.9 and 02 = 0.6. The qTA+SErr' in Ta- 
ble 1 means FA(0~)+SErr(02), on the assump- 
tion that the contirnmd l)hrases are correctly ei- 
ther accel)ted or rejected. -We regard this as- 
smnt)tion as at)l)rol)riate, because users tend to 
answer ~ye, s' simply to express their affirmation 
(Hockey et al, 1997), so the sys|;em can dis- 
tinguish affirmative answer and negative olle by 
grasping simple 'yes' utterances correctly.

achieve 11.5% improvement in total. This result 
proves that our method successflflly eliminates 
recognition errors. 
By making confirmation, the interaction be- 
comes robust, but accordingly the number of 
whole utterances increases. If all candidates 
having CM, o under 01 are given to confirma- 
tion process without setting 0u, 332 wdn con- 
firmation for incorrect contents are generated 
out of 400 candidates. By setting 02,102 candi- 
dates having CMw between 01 and 02 are con- 
firmed, and the number of incorrect confirma- 
tions is suppressed to 53. Namely, the ratio 
of correct hypotheses and incorrect ones being 
confirmed are ahnost equM. This result shows 
indistinct candidates are given to confirmation 
process whereas scarcely confident candidates 
are rejected.

4.4 Effect iveness of Semant ic -At t r ibute  
CM 
In Figure 5, the relationship between content- 
word CM and semantic-attribute CM is shown. 
It is observed that semantic-attribute CMs are 
estimated more correctly than content-word 
CMs. Therefore, even when successful interpre- 
tation is not obtained fl'om content-word CMs, 
semantic-attribute can be estimated correctly. 
In experimental data, there are 148 slots 2 
that are rejected by content-word CMs. It is 
also observed that 52% of semantic-attributes

are included in their phrases.

with CA4c over 0.9 is correct. Such slots amomit 
to 34. Namely, our system can generate tt.'cc- 
rive guidances against 23% (34/148) of utter- 
antes that had been only rejected in conven- 
tional methods. 
5 Conc lus ion  
We present dialogue mallagement using two 
concel)t-level CMs in order to realize rolmst ill- 
teractioll. The content-word CM provides a 
criterion to decide whether an interpretation 
should be accel)ted, confirmed, or rejected. This 
strategy is realized by setting two thresholds 
that are optimized balancing false acceptance 
and false rejection. The interpretation error 
(FA+SErr) is reduced by 5.4% with no confir- 
mation and by \] 1.5% with confirmations. More- 
over, we &',line CM on semantic attribut(~s, and 
propose a new met;hod to generate ilbx:tive 
guidances. The concept-t)ased (:onfidence mea- 
sure realizes tlexible mixed-initiative dialogue in
