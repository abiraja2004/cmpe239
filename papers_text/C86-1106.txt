I. Introduction 
Automatic identification of homonyms in kana-to- 
kanji conversions systems and of multivocal words in 
machine translation systems cannot be sufficiently 
implemented by the mere combination of grammer and 
word dictionaries. This calls for a new concept of 
knowledge data. What the new knowledge data is and 
how it can be acquired are mentioned in the paper. 
In natural language research, active discussion has 
been make within the framework of knowledge and 
samples of knowledge. 
2. Phases of Natural Language Study and Knowledge 
Data 
\[phase 1\] 
In the initial phase when natural language had 
not been fully clarifiedj the authors made an attempt 
to analyze the language with the help of word dic- 
tionaries and grammar alone, and to build a new 
system from the results. We, however, encountered a 
great number of homonyms in kana-to-kanji conversion, 
as well as multivocal words and other problems in 
machine translation. This was because the grammar 
and dictionaries were too simple. In other words, 
w i + /T(~i) 
where ~i is a word and /T is a conversion system. 
\[phase 2\] 
There are some possible means for solving the 
problems encountered in Phase i. They include the 
following: analyze the word frequency, limit the 
number of words in use, limit the contents of the 
words in use, limit the fields and limit sentences. 
This helps remove, or at least minimize, homonyms, 
multivoeal words and ambiguities. A system with 
limitations, however, involves too many difficulties 
to be readily accepted. 
\[phase 3\] 
In vocabulary, no words are used independently. 
One should define and use words by clarifying the 
characteristics, coverage and conditions of words. 
This may be expressed as follows: 
~i I Pi I ' Pi2 'Pi~ ' ..... ' Pin 
? /T(~i I Pil 'Pi2 . . . . . . . .  Pin ) =yj 
where ~i is a word; and Pil' Pi2' ..... ' Pin are the 
limitations of ~i" The set of Pil' Pi2 ~ ..... ' Pin 
should be low in number and simple. 
Different approaches have already been proposed 
as to what is necessary for clarifying the conditions 
for the coverage of words in Phase 3. Some examples 
are semantic markers, semantic categories and thesau- 
rus. However, the author~ put emphasis on the rela- 
tionship of words, though recognizing such other 
forms of approach. 
\[Knowledge Obtained from Words\] 
Words and sentences provide knowledge shown in 
Table I, from simple to complicated in order. How 
much of them are usable as dictionaries (books)? 
How much are usable as machine-readable dictionaries? 
In Table I, machine-readable dictionaries have 
already been established for I. "Word-related 
Attributes". Classified vocabulary lists have been 
prepared for Thesaurus Structure in 2~ but there is 
almost nothing for the other attributes. 
Therefore, an attempt to build a sophisticated 
system would be unsuccessful if no basic knowledge 
data is available.

3. Is it Possible to Define Word Coverage and 
Conditions? 
Since every word may be linked with an infinite 
number of words, one may wonder if it is impossible 
to define word coverage and conditions. It would 
also take a great deal of time and trouble to examine 
all the words that are almost infinite in number. 
If, however, one actually examines some of tlle words, 
we will fine that every word is linked with a limited 
number of words.

Take the word, "denwa" (meaning telephone in 
English) as example, lit has a limited number of 
characteristics such as a means of communication, a 
substance, a place, and so on. The function as a 
means of eo~imnication and the characteristics of tile 
telephone are unique to the telephone. 
In this particular meaning, it is a simple and 
finite task to count the different relationships 
between words. It is, however, extremely difficult 
to count the word-to-word relationships for the 
general meanings such as a substance and a place. 
However, it is possible to organize the major 
relationships without much effort. 
The only approach would be to tabulate the words 
having peculiar relationship to specific words and 
the relationship between specific words and words of 
high usage frequency, and thus use system-preset 
defaults for other words. 
Such words as "takai" (meaning high) and 
"utsukushii" (meaning beautiful) are used frequently. 
In some cases, therefore, it is difficult to deter- 
mine the coverage and conditions of individual words. 
Such cases must include general grammar and the mean- 
ing of words most frequently used in "takai" and 
"utsukushii" must be defined in the word-to-word 
relationships together with the conditions of any 
special meanings of high and beautiful. Words of 
low frequency and high frequency are dependent on 
individual rules (conditions based on word-to-word 
relationship) and general grammar. 
4, Aquis i t ion of Knowledge data 
4-1 Method by extract ing and segmenting Kanji str ings 
Authors and S. Mizutani of Tokyo Women's Christian 
College mechanically extracted the four-character 
kanji strings from some JICST abstract files, ex- 
tracted meaningful concept co~)inations from them~ 
and classified them into 45 categories. Thus, after 
examing 78,000 four character kanji strings, 28,000 
different kinds of knowledge data was obtained from 
32,000 types of kanji strings in net. This approach 
is promising because it allows easy expansion in 
quantity and consists mainly of mechanical processing. 
In addition, an attempt to reorganize a total of 
887,000 data, 200,000 in net, is under way. An 
atten~t to apply the same idea to the three and five 
character kanji strings is also being made.

4-2 Aquisition of knowledge data based on word-to- 
word synchronism 
In this ease, Japanese sentences should be 
analyzed to extract connections and obrain knowledge 
data. Analysis, however, takes a great deal of time 
and involves ambiguity. This suggests an approach 
which simply extracts independent words handles them, 
if present in the same sentences, as candidates for 
knowledge data because of mutual relation, and 
extracts meaningful knowledge data based on frequency 
and manual procedure. 
\[Example \] 
A boy throws a ball. 
boy throws b ~iI throws boy ball 
To extract such re~ .ships and reorganize them 
sequentially. 
4-3 Aquisition of knowledge by syntax analysis 
This is a method which analyzes the sentences 
that are input with word dictionaries and grammar, 
builds syntax element&~ extracts connections from 
them, and thus, extracts knowledge data. This 
method is theoretically pertinent but not practical 
because it leaves the problem of a tremendous in- 
creasing number of syntax trees. It would be very 
effective if a great amount of knowledge data were 
available and some of the ambiguities from syntax 
analysis were reduced. Since, in Japanese sentences, 
long-unit terms are used as they are, it is also 
necessary to sub-categorize them automatically. 
Otherwise, a variety of knowledge data would result 
and it would be troublesome to systematize knowledge 
data.

This sort of concept was presented by some manufac- 
turers engaged in the research and development of 
machine translation. It is however only in the 
planning stage. There has been no news reporting 
450 
that knowledge data is effectively available.

5. Applications of Knowledge Data 
(I) To develop high quality Japanese word 
processors. 
(2) To improve the quality of machine translation. 
(3) To reduce the ambiguities of syntax analysis. 
(4) To apply knowledge data in handwritten 
character and voice recognition. 
6. Conclusion 
The systemization, aquisition and construction 
of knowledge data are a step towards the next jump in 
Japanese processing systems. Indeed, the knowledge 
data still has a number of problems to be solved, but 
prospects for the future are rather bright.
