Abstract
The paper proposes an information-theory-
based method for feature types analysis in
probabilistic evaluation modelling for
statistical parsing. The basic idea is that we
use entropy and conditional entropy to
measure whether a feature type grasps some
of the information for syntactic structure
prediction. Our experiment quantitatively
analyzes several feature types? power for
syntactic structure prediction and draws a
series of interesting conclusions.
1  Introduction
In the field of statistical parsing, various
probabilistic evaluation models have been
proposed where different models use different
feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993]
[Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996]
[Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman,
1992] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996]. How to
evaluate the different feature types? effects for
syntactic parsing? The paper proposes an
information-theory-based feature types analysis
model, which uses the measures of predictive
information quantity, predictive information
gain, predictive information redundancy and
predictive information summation to
quantitatively analyse the different contextual
feature types? or feature types combination?s
predictive power for syntactic structure.
  In the following, Section 2 describes the
probabilistic evaluation model for syntactic trees;
Section 3 proposes an information-theory-based
feature type analysis model; Section 4
introduces several experimental issues; Section 5
quantitatively analyses the different contextual
feature types or feature types combination in the
view of information theory and draws a series of
conclusion on their predictive powers for
syntactic structures.
2  The probabilistic evaluation model
for statistical syntactic parsing
Given a sentence, the task of statistical syntactic
parsing is to assign a probability to each
candidate parsing tree that conforms to the
grammar and select the one with highest
probability as the final analysis result. That is:
)|(maxarg STPT
T
best =  (1)
where S denotes the given sentence, T denotes
the set of all the candidate parsing trees that
conform to the grammar, P(T|S) denotes the
probability of parsing tree T for the given
sentence S.
  The task of probabilistic evaluation model in
syntactic parsing is the estimation of P(T|S). In
the syntactic parsing model which uses rule-
based grammar, the probability of a parsing tree
can be defined as the probability of the
derivation which generates the current parsing
tree for the given sentence. That is,

  In this way, we can get a unite expression of
probabilistic evaluation model for statistical
syntactic parsing. The difference among the
different parsing models lies mainly in that they
use different feature types or feature type
combination to divide the contextual condition
into equivalent classes. Our ultimate aim is to
determine which combination of feature types is
optimal for the probabilistic evaluation model of
statistical syntactic parsing. Unfortunately, the
state of knowledge in this regard is very limited.
Many probabilistic evaluation models have been
published inspired by one or more of these
feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993]
[Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997]
[Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996], but
discrepancies between training sets, algorithms,
and hardware environments make it difficult, if
not impossible, to compare the models
objectively. In the paper, we propose an
information-theory-based feature type analysis
model by which we can quantitatively analyse
the predictive power of different feature types or
feature type combinations for syntactic structure
in a systematic way. The conclusion is expected
to provide reliable reference for feature type
selection in the probabilistic evaluation
modelling for statistical syntactic parsing.
3 The information-theory-based
feature type analysis model for statistical
syntactic parsing
In the prediction of stochastic events, entropy
and conditional entropy can be used to evaluate
the predictive power of different feature types.
To predict a stochastic event, if the entropy of
the event is much larger than its conditional
entropy on condition that a feature type is
known, it indicates that the feature type grasps
some of the important information for the
predicted event.
  According to the above idea, we build the
information-theory-based feature type analysis
model, which is composed of four concepts:
predictive information quantity, predictive
information gain, predictive information
redundancy and predictive information
summation.
z Predictive Information Quantity (PIQ)
);( RFPIQ , the predictive information quantity
of feature type F to predict derivation rule R, is
defined as the difference between the entropy of
R and the conditional entropy of R on condition
that the feature type F is known.

  Predictive information quantity can be used to

feature type analysis.
z Predictive Information Gain (PIG)
For the prediction of rule R,
PIG(Fx;R|F1,F2,...,Fi), the predictive information
gain of taking Fx as a variant model on top of a
baseline model employing F1,F2,...,Fi as feature
type combination, is defined as the difference
between the conditional entropy of predicting R
based on feature type combination F1,F2,...,Fi
and the conditional entropy of predicting R
based on feature type combination F1,F2,...,Fi,Fx.

then Fx is deemed to be more informative than

PIQ(Fy;R) or not.
z Predictive Information Redundancy(PIR)
Based on the above two definitions, we can
further draw the definition of predictive
information redundancy as follows.
PIR(Fx,{F1,F2,...,Fi};R) denotes the redundant
information between feature type Fx and feature
type combination {F1,F2,...,Fi} in predicting R,
which is defined as the difference between
PIQ(Fx;R) and PIG(Fx;R|F1,F2,...,Fi). That is,

4 Experimental Issues
4.1 The classification of the feature
types
The predicted event of our experiment is the
derivation rule to extend the current non-
terminal node. The feature types for prediction
can be classified into two classes, history feature
types and objective feature types. In the
following, we will take the parsing tree shown in
Figure-1 as the example to explain the
classification of the feature types.
In Figure-1, the current predicted event is the
derivation rule to extend the framed non-
terminal node VP, the part connected by the
solid line belongs to history feature types, which
is the already derived partial parsing tree,
representing the structural environment of the
current non-terminal node. The part framed by
the larger rectangle belongs to the objective
feature types, which is the word sequence
containing the leaf nodes of the partial parsing
tree rooted by the current node, representing the
final objectives to be derived from the current
node.
4.2 The corpus used in the experiment
The experimental corpus is derived from Penn
TreeBank[Marcus,1993]. We semi-
automatically assign a headword and a POS tag
to each non-terminal node. 80% of the corpus
(979,767 words) is taken as the training set, used
for estimating the various co-occurrence
probabilities, 10% of the corpus (133,814 words)
is taken as the testing set, used to calculate
predictive information quantity, predictive
information gain, predictive information
redundancy and predictive information
summation. The other 10% of the corpus
(133,814 words) is taken as the held-out set. The
grammar rule set is composed of 8,126 CFG
rules extracted from Penn TreeBank.

5 The information-theory-based
feature type analysis
The experiments led to a number of interesting
conclusions on the predictive power of various
feature types and feature type combinations,
which is expected to provide reliable reference
for the modelling of probabilistic parsing.
5.1 The analysis to the predictive
information quantities of lexical feature
types, part-of-speech feature types and
constituent label feature types
z Goal
One of the most important variation in statistical
parsing over the last few years is that statistical
lexical information is incorporated into the
probabilistic evaluation model. Some statistical
parsing systems show that the performance is
improved after the lexical information is added.
Our research aims at a quantitative analysis of
the differences among the predictive information
quantities provided by the lexical feature types,
part-of-speech feature types and constituent
label feature types from the view of information
theory.
z Data
The experiment is conducted on the history
feature types of the nodes whose structural
distance to the current node is within 2.
  In Table-1, ?Y? in PIQ(X of Y; R) represents
the node, ?X? represents the constitute label, the
headword or POS of the headword of the node.
In the following, the units of PIQ are bits.
z Conclusion
Among the feature types in the same structural
position of the parsing tree, the predictive
information quantity of lexical feature type is
larger than that of part-of-speech feature type,
and the predictive information quantity of part-
of-speech feature type is larger than that of the
constituent label feature type.

Y= the second right brother of the current node 0.1066 0.5044 0.2525
Y= the second left brother of the current node 0.0949 0.6171 0.2697
Y= the first right brother of the parent 0.1068 0.3717 0.2133
Y= the first left brother of the parent 0.2505 1.5603 0.6145
5.2 The analysis to the influence of the
structural relation and the structural
distance to the predictive information
quantities of the history feature types
z Goal:
In this experiment, we wish to find out the
influence of the structural relation and structural
distance between the current node and the node
that the given feature type related to has to the
predictive information quantities of these feature
types.
z Data:
In Table-2, SR represents the structural relation
between the current node and the node that the
given feature type related to. SD represents the
structural distance between the current node and
the node that the given feature type related to.
Table-2: The predictive information quantity of the selected history feature types

(Y= the grandpa)
0.1066
(Y= the second right brother)
0.1068
(Y= the first right
brother of the parent)
z Conclusion
Among the history feature types which have the
same structural relation with the current node
(the relations are both parent-child relation, or
both brother relation, etc), the one which has
closer structural distance to the current node will
provide larger predictive information quantity;
Among the history feature types which have the
same structural distance to the current node, the
one which has parent relation with the current
node will provide larger predictive information
quantity than the one that has brother relation or
mixed parent and brother relation to the current
node (such as the parent's brother node).
5.3 The analysis to the predictive
information quantities of the history
feature types and the objective feature
types
z Goal
Many of the existing probabilistic evaluation
models prefer to use history feature types other
than objective feature types. We select some of
history feature types and objective feature types,
and quantitatively compare their predictive
information quantities.
z Data
The history feature type we use here is the
headword of the parent, which has the largest
predictive information quantity among all the
history feature types. The objective feature types
are selected stochastically, which are the first
word and the second word in the objective word
sequence of the current node (Please see 4.1 and
Figure-1 for detailed descriptions on the selected
feature types).
Table-3: The predictive information quantity of the selected history and objective feature types
Class Feature type PIQ(Y;R)
History feature type Y= headword of the parent 2.3253
Y= the first word in the objective word sequence 3.2398Objective feature type
Y= the second word in the objective word sequence 3.0071
z Conclusion
Either of the predictive information quantity of
the first word and the second word in the
objective word sequence is larger than that of
the headword of the parent node which has the
largest predictive information quantity among all
of the history feature type candidates. That is to
say, objective feature types may have larger
predictive power than that of the history feature
type.
5.4 The analysis to the predictive
information quantities of the objective
features types selected respectively on the
physical position information, the
heuristic information of headword and
modifier, and the exact headword
information
z Goal
Not alike the structural history feature types, the
objective feature types are sequential. Generally,
the candidates of the objective feature types are
selected according to the physical position.
However, from the linguistic viewpoint, the
physical position information can hardly grasp
the relations between the linguistic structures.
Therefore, besides the physical position
information, our research try to select the
objective feature types respectively according to
the exact headword information and the heuristic
information of headword and modifier. Through
the experiment, we hope to find out what
influence the exact headword information, the
heuristic information of headword and modifier,
and the physical position information have
respectively to the predictive information
quantities of the feature types.
z Data:

z Conclusion
The predictive information quantity of the
headword of the current node is larger than that
of a feature type selected according to the
selected heuristic information of headword or
modifier, and larger than that of a feature type
selected according to the physical positions; The
predictive information quantity of a feature type
selected according to the physical positions is
larger than that of a feature types selected
according to the selected heuristic information
of headword or modifier.
5.5 The selection of the feature type
combination which has the optimal
predictive information summation
z Goal:
We aim at proposing a method to select the
feature types combination that has the optimal
predictive information summation for prediction.
z Approach
We use the following greedy algorithm to select
the optimal feature type combination.
  In building a model, the first feature type to
be selected is the feature type which has the
largest predictive information quantity for the
prediction of the derivation rule among all of the
feature type candidates, that is,

Among the feature types mentioned above, the

6 Conclusion
The paper proposes an information-theory-based
feature type analysis method, which not only
presents a series of heuristic conclusion on the
predictive power of the different feature types
and feature type combination for syntactic
parsing, but also provides a guide for the
modeling of syntactic parsing in the view of
methodology, that is, we can quantitatively
analyse the different contextual feature types or
feature types combination's effect for syntactic
structure prediction in advance. Based on these
analysis, we can select the feature type or feature
types combination that has the optimal
predictive information summation to build the
probabilistic parsing model.
  However, there are still some questions to be
answered in this paper. For example, what is the
beneficial improvement in the performance after
using this method in a real parser? Whether the
improvements in PIQ will lead to the
improvement of parsing accuracy or not? In the
following research, we will incorporate these
conclusions into a real parser to see whether the
parsing accuracy can be improved or not.
Another work we will do is to do some
experimental analysis to find the impact of data
sparseness on feature type analysis, which is
critical to the performance of real systems.
  The proposed feature type analysis method
can be used in not only the probabilistic
modelling for statistical syntactic parsing, but
also language modelling in more general fields
