ABSTRACT: This paper describes a loxical organization in which "scnscs" arc rcprcscnted i n  their 
own right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinct data itcms. The objcctivc of the scheme is to 
facilitate recognition and employment of synonyms and stock phrases by programs which process 
natural la,nguage. Besides presenting the proposed organization, the paper characterizes thc lexical 
"senses" which result. 
1. Introduction. 
- 
This paper describes an internal lexical organization which is particularly designed to capture the 
facts about synonymy. Besides recording the inclusion of each word in one or more synonym sets 
(identified with its various "senses"), the scheme attempts to distribute attributes per~picuously 
between "senses", "wordings", and the intersections of the two. I n  addition, there is provision to 
record multi-word idioms, stock phrases, and the like. and to include these as elements in synonym 
sets when appropriate. 
Briefly, "senses" are represented in their own right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinct 
data items. Each word or phrase is associated with a list of the "senses" which i t  can express; 
conversely, each "sense" is associated with a list of "alternative wo iings" Additionally. each 
word is associated with a list of phrases in which it occurs. 
Grammatical category, features, selection restrictions, and the like are applicable at three different 
levels: to words or phrases as such, to "senscs" as such, or to particular usages of words or phrases 
(equivalently, to particular wordings of "senses"). 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 
This lexical organization has been inlplemerlted at 1BM Research, Yorktown Heights, N.Y., by a 
program -- not to  be described here -- which builds such dictionaries in a very compact form, 
giving interactive assistance to the person making the entries. (For cxaniple, the plrogram p d n  ts 
out the possibility of merging "senses" whenever their wordings overlap and their attributes arc 
compatible, and merges them if so directed.) There are suitable I'acilities for saving the results, 
retrieving them in various ways, and for altering such things as sclienies of classification w i t l i o ~ ~ ~  
scrapping previously prepared work. 
The ultimate intent is that the "dictionary of senses" should serve as the lexical coniponent in a 
natural language fact-retrieval system. Pending its incorporation in that rolc, it will be used to 
amass and organize information on the semantic relations among words and phrases. 
The balance of this paper conies in two sections: 
Section 2 presents the proposed lexical data structures, and suggests haw they arc to be used. 
Included is a sketch of how various types of grammatical anri semantic "attributes" fit into thc 
scheme. 
Section 3 discusses the character of the "senses" encoded in the resulting dictictlary. Reasons arc 
advanced for regarding lexical "senses" as something far short of semantic primitives. At the same 
time, synonym sets are defended against the view that "true paraphrases are rare or rtonexistcnt".

2. The Internal Remesentation. 
It will be our purpose in this section to say just enough about internal representation to lay bare 
the organizing principles of the lexicon. The focus is on architecture afid motivations; details of 
field layouts, internal codes, etc. are not at issue here. 
To make the discllssion concrete, suppose we are interested in the senses of the word "changev 
Assuming that none of the words are unfamiliar, the following should put us in mind of two senses: 
change: 1. v alter; 
2. n small coin. 
This, of course, is just a dictionary entry in the traditional format (though with synonyms offered 
in lieu of definitions), 
On the other hand, we might approach the same information from a different direction: starting 
with the two concepts, we might seek words to express them. It is difficult to picture this latter 
situation without assigning artificial labels to the concepts. Call them concepts 1 and 2, and 
suppose for a moment that there were a practical way to look the concepts up (witlzozlt having 
thought of either word for either concept). Then the information to be retrieved might be envi- 
sioned this way: 
I .  v change, alter 
2. n change, small coin 
It is this duality of viewpoint -- that words have senses, while senses have wordings -- that our 
lexical representation must reflect. 
The starting point, then, is that words, phrases, and "senses" are separately represented. There are 
three principal types of data item, plus a standard connector: 
1. A "Key Data Item " ( K D I )  represent:; a single word. 
2. A "Phrase Data Item" (PDI)  represents a string of two or more words which are to 
serve as a unit in some context.. 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 
3. A "Sense Data Item" (SDI) represents one distinct sense common to a set of wordq 
and/or phrases. In general, a word or phrase may be usable in more than one sense, 
while a given sense may have alternative (synonymous) wordings. Both these types of 
variability are recorded making use of the next data item: 
4. A "Sertse Link Element" (SLE) is a connective item, to be explained shortly. 
Three principal fields will engage our attention in each type of data item. Fig. 1 summarizes the 
fields for each type.

"Sense 
Chain" 
Link 
Each KDI (Key Data Item) or PDI (Phrase Data Item) coiltains an "alternative senses" link -- al 
pointer to the first SLE (Sense Link Element) in a chain of SLE's which represent the various 
senses of the word or phrase. The SLE's are chained via their own "alternative senses" links, and 
the final member points back to the KDI or PDI. Thus, we shall speak of such a chain as a ring 
Local

specifically, an "alternative senses ring". If no senses are on record for a particular word ox 
phra , the "alternative senses" link in the KDI or PDI is ssl: referent. 
Reciprocally, each SDI (Sense Data Item) contahs an "alt-native wordings" link. This leads to a 
chain of S L E ~ S  which represent more-or-less synonymous wordings mat express the sense. These 
SLE's are chained through their own "alternative wordink links, and again the chain is closed 
into a ring -- this time beginniog and ending with the SDI. 
The structure that is shaping up may now be seen in Fig. 2, The crtrcicrl poirir is that encll SLE  
represents the intersection betwen nn "alternntive  sense^ ring nrrd an "cllterncirive wordi~rgs" 
ring. From the standpoint of the word or phrase, it; represents a particular scnse; from the 
standpoint of the sense, it represents a particular wordink 
Starting from a KDI or PDI, one gets to the SDI for a particular sense by advancing along the 
"alternative senses" ring to the relevant SLE, then &touring along the ring which connects t h ~  
latter to the SDI (as one of the SDI's "alternative wordings"). Starting from an SDI, one gets to a 
particular wording by the reverse process. Since each "alternative senses" ring contains exactly 
one KDI or PDI, while each "alternative wording#' ring contains exactly one SDI, each SLE is tied 
to exactly one sense of one word or phrase. (Eani~alently, it is tied to one wording of one sense.) 
The next point of interest is that "attribute" f ' i~ lds  are present in all four types of data item -- even 
in the connectors (SLE's). The attributes which may be recorded in each, however, come from 
different bags. 
To  begin with, the attributes found in an SDI characterize a11 the wordings of a given sense 
whenever the wording-, are used in that sense. In Fig. 2, for example, sense " I "  should be marked 
as a "verb" sense, whil? sense "2" is a "noun". One would not wish to record the attribute "verb" 
in the KDI for the word "change", for the KDI represents facts about the word itself, irrespective 
of sense, and "verb" does no! 'hold for all uses of the word "change". On the other hand, "verb" 
does characterize all wordings of sense "I", whenever they're being employed to express that 
sense. It would furthermore apply to any additional wordings which we might think of, such as 
"modify", provided they are really used in a synonymous way. 
As a matter of fact, it turns out that the traditional parts of speech -- noun, verb, adjective, 
preposition, etc. -- fit best in this scheme as global attributes of senses, recorded i l l  the SDI's.

senses of "alter" 
Fig. 2 
"Alternative Senses" and "Alternative Wordings" Rings 
(The first sense has two wordings: "alter" and "change". The second sense has wordings "change" 
and "small coin". Two senses are recorded for "change", and one sense each for "alter'.' and 
"small coin".) 
A different sort of attribute may be recorded in a KDI, as a global feature of the word itself. For 
example, we may note of the word "change" that it is "regularly conjugated". That is, when used 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 8 
as a verb, it forms the third person singular by adding "s", and both past ~ n d  past participle by 
adding "ed" To be sure, this "global" attribute applies only to the "verb" senses of "change"; but 
a moment's reflection will confirm that "change" has more than one "verb" sense, and the 
regularity of its conjugation is common to all of them. Thus, it is useful to note this regularity as an 
attribute of the word itself. (Contrast this with the behavior of the word "can", which is regular 
w h n  it means "to pack in cans", but irregular when it means "is able to".) 
Various other attributes suggest themselves as global characterizers of the words thcn~selvcs, to bc 
recarded in the KDI's. For example, one might wish to note of "change" that it drops its final "e" 
whon adding "ing" (this is the normal rule) but of "singe" that it doesn't. 
Still other attributes are appropriate when characterizing multi-word units (in PDl's). A string o f  
words whose meaning is not evident from the nlere juxtaposition of its constittlents (such as "givc 
up") may be classified as an "idiom", A string of words whose meaning could be figured out from 
the meanings of its constituents, but which occurs with enough frequency to warrant inclusion in 
the dictionary, might be classed as a "stock phrase". (Example: "drop dead".) A string like 
"perform in a subordinate role", which one would not normally expect to encounter in its own 
right, might be classed as a "definition" (for a certain sense of the word "accompany", difficult to 
reword except with a definition). 
Perhaps the most unexpected site for recording attributes is in the connective elements (SLE's). 
These are the logical place, though, to note features that apply to a specific sense of a word, 
without being global to either the sense or the word. Consider the following four senrenccs: 
On the way to the office, he stopped daydreaming. 
On the way to the office, he ceased daydreaming. 
On the way to the office, he ceased to daydream. 
versus: 
On thebway to the office, he stopped to daydream. 
Suppose we choose to view this as a restriction upon the (surface) object of the verb: "stop", when 
applied to an action, must take a gerund as its object; "cease" can take either a gerund or an 
infinitive. (It wouldn't affect the point being made if we said that "stop" inhibits a certain 
grammatical transformation en route to surface structure, while "cease" pennits it.) 
An Organization tur a Dictionary of Word Senses 9 
Now, we wouldn't want to mark "gerund object only" as a global. attribute of the sense, for we 
have just shown that "cease" and "stop", two wordings of the sense, differ with respect to this 
restriction. On the other hand, it doesn't belong among the global attributes of the word "stop" as 
such, for "stop" has other verb senses, even transitive ones, tu which the restriction is completely 
inapplicable. (Consider "stop a hole in the dike", "stop a catastrophe", etc.) That leaves the 
alternative we are suggesting: treat the restriction as an attribute of one particular usage of thc 
word (equivalently, one particular wording of the sense).

Besides having senses, individu~l words are involved in phrases, and this fact is also represented in 
our data structure. Fig. 3 shows the plan of attack. I'n the KDI for each word, there is a l ink 
connecting it to the PDI for the first phrase in which the word is known to occur, together with a 
number designating the position of the word (Ist, Znd, 3rd. etc.) in that phrase. In  the PDI itself, 
there is a coiltinuation link for each word of the phrase, together with its niiri~ber in the next 
phrase. In the final PDI involving a given word, the link for that word points back to the KDI.  
Thus, independent of its "altcrnative senses" ring, each KDI tnay hmc r~ "phrase invol\~cit~ents" 
ring. 
This structure makes i t  possible to retrieve all the idioms, stock phrases, definitions, etc., in which 
a given word has made its appearance, anywhere in the dictionary. As the same structure is used to 
encode every multi-word unit, no occurrence of a word is ever lost sight of, and r~ phrase can be 
looked up via any of its constituent words. 
Of the fields to which Fig. 1 calls attention, we have discussed all but one. In the SDI for each 
"sense", tbpre is a "sense chain" link field. This links the SDI to its successor in a global chain of 
"senses". Using this chain, it is possible to make an exhaustive, non-duplicative list of all the 
"senses" recorded in the dictionary. The listing program has only to proceed down the chain, 
retrieve frdm each SDI its attributes, decode them, then chase around the "alternative wordings' 
ring of the SDI and list the wordings alongside the attributes. 
One more feature of the internal representation deserves mention: the data items for words occur 
as "leaves" in a lexical tree (Fig. 4). That is, the KDI for a word can be looked u p  letter-by-letter, 
following a chain of pointers that correspond to successive letters. The chain ends at a KDI after 
following a substring sufficient to distinguish the word fro111 the nearest thing like i t  in thc 
dictionary. The lexical tree has the advantage that words can be looked up  either at random or in 
sequence. 
Recapitulating, these are the essential features of the representation: 
*1) "Senses" are represented separately from "wordings", and the mutual connections 
between them are made explicit in both directions. 
*2) "Wordings" may be either single words or multi-word pnrases. I hese are representea by 
distinct types of data item, and may be subject to distinct schemes of classification. but 
they are on the same footing with regard to "sense" connections. With each word is 
associated an exhaustive list of the phrases in which it  occurs.

the full tree. The path to each word is only as long as needed to distinguish it from the neighbor 
with which it shares the longest leading substring.) 
*3) Classifiers and features, drawn from appropriate sets, may be attributed separately to 
words, to phrases, to senses, or to particular senses of words or phrases (i.e., to particu- 
lar wordings of senses). 
*4) The data items which represent senses are globally chained, and may be exhaustively 
listed. 
An Organhation for a Dictionary of Word Senses 
*5) The data items which represent words are accessible as "leaves" of a lexical tree; hence 
they may either be retrieved by lookup (in response to presentation of the words) or 
volunteered in alphabetical order, 
Given a con~mitn~ent to repreiknt a lexicon as suggested by points * 1 through 9 tabovc, various 
implementations would be possible. Alternative implementations of individtlal points (though not 
of the scheme as a whole) have in fact been described by other writers. Tlte lexical tree ( * S ) ,  for 
example, is no great novelty: Sydney M Lamb and William H. Jacobsen describe implementation 
details of one such tree [SJ. [lo] also concerns a dictionary which uscs this general style of 
organization for lookup. For '.hat matter, the lexical tree is reminiscent of Fcigcrrbr~um's 
"discrin~ination tree." [ 11 
More interestingly, the Separate representation of senses n11d wordings has been incorporated in 
othei. systems by R. F. Simnlons ([I l l ,  [12]) and by Larry R. Harris (31. This way of looking at 
matters led Harris to remark some of the same points that we have been stressing: that senses have 
alternative wordings just as words have alternative senses; that multi-word phrases might occur on 
the same footing as individual words in the expression of a sense; and (interestingly enough) that 
part-of-speech information really adheres to the "sense", not to the "word" Similarly, Simmons 
associates his "deep case" information with lexical nodes representing "wordsenscs",, while words 
the~nselves are treated as "print image" attributes of the wordsenses. 
Harris's dictionary was only a minor component in a small-scale model of concept acquisition. No 
great number of either words or concepts was required to illustrate the principles at stake, so 
Harris programmed the dictionary as an array, with words represented by rows and "concepts" by 
columns. Elements of the array were merely frequencies, indicating the strength of association 
between each word and each concept. 
Needless to say, for a full-scale vocabulary of words and concepts, such an array is mostly empty; 
nobody would dream of expanding it in that form. From a programming standpoint, the only 
thinkable choice is some form of list structure. Having decided in principle to use "some form of 
list structure", though, one might well ask: Why chains? Why rings? Why not just include in each 
Key Data Item a full list of pointers to the corresponding Sense Data Items. and vice-versa? 
The answer is simply one of convenience. It's easier to handle insertions and deletions when they 
don't require the movement of expanded items to new quarters, or the provision of "overflow" 
pointers. It's easier to reclaim freed storage when deleted items come in a handful of standard 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 13 
sizes. As for "rings", they eliminate the need for two-way pointers, since one can break into a ring 
at any point and follow it to its source. 
It should be noted that to make rings an attractive representation, the details of the material being 
represented must cooperate, In particular, the rings must not become too long, or the processing 
requlred to follow them becomes excessive. It happens that "alternative senses" rings and 
"alternative wordings" rings are typically short rarely more than a dozen links per ring. "Phrase 
involvement" rings, on the other hand, can become spectacularly long, especially for words like 
"a*' and "to". In practice, it's necessary to provide these rings with short-cut links. 
Any of these, programming details could be altered, however, without abando~ting tltc ossencc of 
the scheme, which is given in points * 1 through * 5  above.

3.  The Character of Lexical Senses. 
-- - 
Pe~haps the first tljing to get straight about the "senses" represented in this dictionary is what they 
are not. They are aot "concepts"; they are not a set of "primitives" into which human  espurlcncc 
an be decomposed, No conjecture is put forivard here [hot any such collcrtion of discrete, i~tr~riiic 
concepts even exists, let ulonc that i t  might be finite. 
Rather, the "senses" of the dictionary are in thc nr.urc of fuzzy equivalcncc sets among worcis. 
(This is only a metaphor; we shall do more and more violence to thc ttchnicul notion of an 
"equivalence set" as we proceed.) Each "sense" groups n set of words which, in n set of appr:~pri- 
ate cu.ntexts; might be tiscd ~nore or less intcrchangenbly. That the cq\livalenct. sots arc fu7'r.y. nrie 
can convir~cc otleself with but the briefest im~~~crs ion  n the r~lntcrials of thc. l a n g ~ i ~ p ~  -- trying to 
decide whether particular words belong in particular groups or justiPi\~ the crcr~tion of new groups. 
Consider, for example, the following set of words and phrases: 
(abandon, give up, surrender, relinquish, let go. desert, leave, forsake, abdicate) 
Clearly, there is a common theme that can run through all of these, given the right circumstances. 
It might be expressed as "reluctant parting from somebody or something". This can be seen by 
coupling the verbs with var.ious possible objects: 
(abandon, give up, surrender) a town to the enemy 
(abandon, give up) all hope 
(give up, relinquish) one's claim to an estate 
(give up, let go) our entire stock at a loss 
(abandon, desert, leave) one's wife and children 
(desert, forsake) a friend in need 
(give up, abdicate) the throne 
An Organhtion for a Dictionary of Word Senses 
(abandon, desert) an exhausted mine 
(forsake, give up) all other, keeping thee only to her/him 
(abandon, desert, leave) the area threatened by the storm 
Should we, then, declare this group of words to be a "sense"? There are difficulties. The various 
words carry nuances, which it may or may not be easy to ignore in a particular context, 
"Forsake", for example, can suggest that there is something reprehensible about the action. It can 
also connote formal renunciation, and the above example from a marriage vow shows that the 
formality can be present without the reprehensibility. Nuances get in the way of interchangeabili- 
ty; it would sound strange to substitute "desert" into the marriage vow. 
Besides nuances, the individual words have conventional areas of application. One does not 
normally say that the doctors "deserted" all hope, or that an errant husband "surrendered" his 
wife and children. The minister officiating at a wedding would be considered daft if be adjured the 
bride and groom to "abdicate" all others, and a merchant would not advertize that he was 
"relinquishing" his entire stock at a loss. (Somehow, the larkr situaaon calls for more pedestrian 
language.) 
At the opposite extreme, overawed by this lack of interchangeability, we might decide to respect 
the unique personality of each word, abolishing equivalenioe classes altogether. The inconvenience 
of such a cop-out is obvious: we then have to introduce some other mechanism for recognizing the 
equivalence of utterances that are intended synonymously, though they employ different words. 
But beyond being inconvenient, the exclusion of equidence sets is a denial of linguistic facts -- 
just as bad, in its own way, as the naive attribution of unconditional synonymy. 
For it is a commonplace of everyone's experience that the speaker and the listener agree to ignore 
the nuances of words, whenever nuances get in the way of communication. A writer who has used 
the word "give up" eight times in five lines will surely cast about for some alternative ways of 
saying the same thing. If "relinquish" and "abandon" would normally be too flowery, or if 
"mender" would in other circumstances call to mind an armistice ceremony in a railway wagon. 
that will not deter the writer from tossing in a few occurrences of those words -- once a context 
has been established that discourages the overtones. Nor will the reader understand matters any 
differently. It is as if writer and reader conspired: "We're fed up with that word, let's hear 
another." Or, perhaps, the writer simply connives at jolting the reader awake with frequent 
changes of idiom, maybe even an occasional incongruity. En any case, synonymy is imposed upan 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 16 
the words, and this literary behavior merely exaggerates what people do habitually in cbmmon 
speech. 
Not only can words be stripped of nuances normally present; they can toke on colorations 
suggested by the context. The suggestion of "reluctance" conveyed by all thc verbs of our example 
can be inferred, in at least one case, from the setting alone; and in this case, a variety of rnorc 
neutral verbs could be used synonymously: 
(part with, take leave of) our entire stock at a loss 
One could even substitute the word "sell", and it wouldn't change the meaning that was already 
bad into the utterance. But to adnlit contest-dependent synonyniy of this clcgrcc is to strctch the 
equivalence sets" to thc point of uselessness. 
It comes to this: neither the grouping nor the separation of words can be fully justified. Grouping 
is nearly always conditional, and separation is often so. If one could anticipate all possible contexts 
in which a group of words could occur, one could perhaps enumerate all possible equivalence sets 
-- one for each combination of word group with a set of contexts making the words interchangea- 
ble. Anyone, however, can see the futility of that aspiration. 
In the end, one settles for messy compromises. Words are grouped if a largish set of contexts in 
which they are interchangeable springs readily to mind. They are separated (into perhaps overlap- 
ping groups) if the imagination readily suggests contexts in which their meanings differ 
"significantly" -- whatever "significantly" may mean. In doubtful cases, when words are grouped 
somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add markings some clay that will prevent misuse 
of the equivalence. When words are separated somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to 
add a mechanism some day that will recognize their relatedness. 
In the end, too, one assigns internal structure to the equivalence sets. That's the effect of assigning 
local attributes to the alternative wordings ("animate subject", "object a vehicle", etc.): const- 
raints are imposed upon the interchangeability of the wordings. More radical structuring can be 
accomplished if, for example, one notes "government" as an alternative wording of the sense 
"govern, rule, control", with the attribute "nominalization". 
A trenchant discussion of such difficulties may be found in Kelly and Stone [4]. There the 
emphasis is upon disambiguation: given a word in a passage of text, they seek to identify (by 
selection from a fixed list of possibilities) the sense in which it is used. Building a computerized 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 
dictionary for the purpose, they soon became concerned with the arbitariness and the proliferation 
of target "senses", as taken from standard desk dictionaries. They argue, with persuasive exam- 
ples, that what lexicographers conventionally distinguish as separate senses of a word are often just 
applications of the word's underlying concept to different contexts. To cover the various contexts, 
the underlying concept has to be stretched a little, by a process of metaphoric extension. This 
metaphoric process is beyond our present power to computerize, but for 'the long run looks 
indispensable for successful language processing. Meanwhile, the authors advocate a dictionary 
which records for each word as few discrete senses as practicable, combining into one scnsc all the 
usages which can reasonably be united by a common underlying thougl~t. 
It is interesting to re-examine Kelly and Stone's argument with a diffcrent task in n~inii: not tile 
disambiguation of one word, but the recognition of synonymy between two words. A n~etaphorical 
capability would be as useful for the one task as for the other, but in the case of synonynl rccogni- 
tion, some of the considerations which have guided traditional lexicography remain pertinent. In 
particular, it is necessary to ask not merely whether the concepts overlap, but whether the one 
word may in fact be used in place of the other. As noted before, usage is restricted by conventional 
domaitls of application; for example, an "alteration" is conceptually both a "change" and a 
"modification", but one wouldn't call it a change or a modification when painting a sign for a 
tailor's shap. 
The arbitrariness of the equivalence sets is not all that disqualilies then1 as "conceptual 
primitives". There is a much deeper difficulty in the fact that practically all "senses" can be 
paraphrased in terms of other "senses". Take, for example, the intransitive sense of "change" (as 
in "My, but you've changed!"). Surely, one would suppose, the concept of "change" must be 
primitive? Change of state is what well-nigh a third of all verbs are about. 
But if "change" is a "primitive", it's a peculiar sort of "primitive", for i t  can be paraphrased in a 
variety of ways: 
(change, become different, cease to be the same, assume new characteristics, make a 
transition into a new state) 
Note that the multi-word paraphrasals are not idioms; the individual words contribute their usual 
meaqings to concatenated meanings which express the concept "change". 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 18 
But perhaps we were merely unlucky? Perhaps we chanced upon a concept which looked elemental 
but actually turned out to be complex. Maybe the real primitives are "become", "be", "cease", 
"different", "same", etc. Let's dig into that possibility. 
What does it mean to "become X", where X is an adjective? The meaning can bc \~ario\isly 
expressed: 
(become X, come to bq X, get to be X, get X, turn X, grow X, assume thc charrtctcris- 
tic X) 
That's a discouraging number of ways for a "primitive" to be re-expressible -- though if  we choose 
to regard "come to be" and "get to be" as idiomatic concatcnr\tions of words, only onc of the 
alternatives makes use of other concepts to explain the one at hand. 
As for "different", it implies a whole underlying anecdote about sortlebody making a contparisoi~, 
after first making a judgment about relevant things to compare. In the combination of the two 
concepts -- "become different" --, we furthermore drop mention of the objects being compared. 
It's simply understood that they are certain attributes of the subject at two points in time. 
It is tempting to invent ad-hoc "transformational" explanations for these phenomena. One might 
conjecture, for example, tliat "The man changed." is a surface realization of four underlying 
sentences: 
(Man be X at time m. Man be Y at time n. X not equal Y, Time n greater-than time n ~ . )  
Thetrouble  with explanations of this sort -- apart from the fact that they introduce growing 
complexity into the understanding of straightforward utterances -- is that they assign arbitrary 
primacy to some concepts at the expense of others. Why should 
"time n greater-than time m" 
be an assumed primitive? May we not equally well conjecture that "time n greater-than time m" is 
a surface realization of these?: 
(Time be m. Time change. Then time be n.) 
For that matter, why not view 
An Organization for a Dictibnary of Word Senses 
"Time elapsed. " 
as a surface form of this?: 
"At least one thing in the universe changed." 
After all, what is "time" but a nominalized way of talking about the presence and partitioning of 
change? 
The difficulty, it would seem, lies in the very notion of context-independent "conceptual 
primitives". The metaphor itself is at fault: it calls to mind a fixed set of dements, like thosc of 
which matter is composed, out of which all ideus must be compounded. But where concepts arc 
concerned, primitivity is a matter of focus, Shift the perspective a little, and new elenlcnts swim 
into view as fundamentals, while former simples become con~plex. 
A more promising metaphor is the analogy to a 'vector space. A set of basis vectors is, in a way, a 
set of "primitives" out of which all the entities in the space can be composed. These primitives 
have the appealing property that they are only primitive relative to one frame of reference. Rotatc 
your point of view, and what used to come natural as basis vectors are now at an angle; they 
become easier to express as sums of vectors that lie along new axes. That bears a resemblance to 
what we have seen,in tlhe case of lexical "primitives". 
Thus far and no further may the analogy be pushed, however. The elements which span 
"conceptual space" can be no such uniform set of objects as those in a vettor space, while the 
rules of composition are coextensive with grammar -- at a minimum. Composition of concepts 
itself contributes to the meaning. (For that matter, it is arguable whether concepts are sufficiently 
separable to model them as discrete objects at all -- whether simple or composite.) Moreover as 
"conceptual space" must encompass all things thinkable, the rules of composition must themselves 
be part of the space. That is, the operators as much as the things operated upon lie within the space 
to be spanned. 
A seming counterexample to these remarks may be found in the "primitive ACT's" of conceptual 
dependency theory, as propounded by Schank, Goldman, Rieger, and Riesbeck (121, [7], [8], [9]). 
On a close reading, however, the "primitive ACT's" turn out to be verb paradigms -- powerful, 
semantically motivated generalizations about large classes of verbs. The names of these paradigms 
replace specific verbs as building blocks in the "conceptual" representation of an utterance. The 
An manbation f ~ r  a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 0 
effect is to provide strong guidelines for the inference of unstated information, for the comparison 
of related utterances, for paraphrasal, etc. 
TO represent a particular verb in terms of these ACT's, however, i t  is necessary to augment each 
ACT with various substructures which detail the manner, the means, the type of actor or object, 
etc. No reduced set of representatives is as yet offered for the adverbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.  in 
terms of which the "primitive ACT's" are qualified. If such additional condcnsntion werc 
attempted, the elaboration of a given utterance in terms of the full set of "primitives" might well 
ramify without practical end. In other words, reduction of the set of names L'or nodes (and labels 
for arcs) must be purchased at the expense of extending the number of them required to represent 
each utterance, 
In conceptual dependency representation, just as in the sernantic networks" of Quillinn [ 6 ] ,  
Simmons ([I I], [12]), Slocum, and others, reality ultimately appears as a shimmering web, every 
part of which trembles when any part of it is touched upon. Taken in its totality, the system -- as 
yet -- is entirely compatible with skepticism about a corrrprehensive set of "conceptual primitives" 
In any case, the verbal "senses" proposed here lie at a far lower level of generality than the 
"primitive ACT's" used in conceptual dependency theory. In terms of that theory, they come 
closest to the so-called "CONCEXICON entries" used by Goldman in realizing surface expres- 
sions 'of a concept from its conceptual representation [2]. Given a primitive ACT, Goldman 
narrows it down to a particular "CONCEXICON" entry by applying the tests in a discrin~ination 
tree to the rest of the structure in which the ACT appears. 
Our lexical "senses", therefore, are lcft with a humbled role. If they span anything, it might best 
be thought of as "communication space", not "conceptual space". Even in this light, they arc a 
hugely redundant basis, and a not at all unique one. They form no inventory of the experiences 
being communicated about; "meaning" is still a step removed, still evoked rather than embodied 
by the elements of this basis. 
If we persist in calling these things "senses", it is because that is the traditional term for what is 
brought to mind as the synonym sets of a given word are enumerated. The tie-in with meaning is 
tenuous, but the human user is able to supply it. There is at least this much justification for the 
term: synonym sets, more forcefully than words, direct attention to the points at which a tie-in 
must be made between the tokens of communication and the underlying representation of "world 
knowledge" 
An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 1 
In a full-fledged system for processing natural language, then, we must envision the "dictionary of 
senses" as a component stretching vertically across the "upper" layers. Its "sense data items" must 
link, ifi some way, to the deeper-lying data structures which encode "knowledge of the world" (the 
"pragmatic component"). The "key data items" and "phrase data items" register tokens to be 
expected or employed in "surfzrce" utterances. Global and local attributes recorded in the various 
data items guide parsing and interpretation. Where one takes i t  froin there depends upon thc 
linguistic approach to be used.

Putnam argues f o r  a satirical privacy for  machines by asserting that, just us it makes no sense 
to ask John  how he knows that he is in pain, so i t  makes no  sense to ask a Turing Machine 
(TM) how it knows that it is in stnte n. When addressed to an abstract Tb1 the question is 
absurd, but not when addressed to a physically realized TM. Putiirlm equivocates about the 
notion of stnte, discussirig only abstract TM's when introducing the notion of state, bu t  
making an argument which is cohcrer~t only with respect ot  a physicaliy r en l i~cd  TM. There 
is thus, in  effect, n cot)fusion between 'state' as of an ai1t0111;lt n rind 'stnte' as of a real Y machine which is executing a program which rcalizes that automaton--any of a i iun~ber  of 
states of the machine might correspond to one state of  the nutonlaton embodied in  the 
progranl. Thus Putnam's argument fails. Clarke's criticisms of Putnam are rilisguided but 
instructive. A more serious notion of ir~achine privacy can be constructed by noting that  i t  
is impossible to  inter the machine's real activitity deterrninately f r o m  the content of registers.

A Graphical Programming System with Speech Input 
Chacko C. Ncroth

Computers & Grapltics I:227-231, 1975 
The experimental problem solving environrnen t is o n e  of formulating specifying, debugging 
and executing (algebraic) procedures interactively on a small processor. T h e  speech 
recognition system is a real time, syntax directed, limited vocabulary, highly cost effect ive 
scheme specifically tailored to this environment. The  data transformation operations of the 
language are verbally specified and the control flow is specified graphically as a two- 
dimensional directed graph. The  semantics of the  latter structure is independent o f  the time 
sequence o f  its input. An input restricted (conditional input) pseudo-finite state machine 
model is used fo r  the continuous syntax checking of the input on an atomic token basis and 
f o r  directing the speech recognizer.

General problems in N L  processing are discussed and a methodology is presented. A N L  
system should consist of a supervisory module which reads and interprets certain input 
sentences stated i n  some specific way. These serttences tell the systern what kind of job is 
being done. The system would have various syntactic, semantic, and praglnatic processing 
modules available t o  it. Technological developmel~ls may well niake it practical for  
iridividuals to have CNLlS (Cotrputerizcd Piatural Language Inforniution System) terminals in  
their homes. A typic4 user terrninal may include a microcornp~~ter an interactive TV, and  
an electric typewriter. In the computerization of Chinese, a simplification of the written 
characters is urged.

Five types of Chinese language data processing systems are discussed. 1) Accept assembly 
code in English and hand-coded Chinese data and use an expanded subroutine library. 2) 
Accept assembly code and data, both in Chinese. by adding a pre-assembler and translators to  
the manufacturer-supplied assembler and linkage editor. 3) Accept a high-level Chinese 
programming language and Chinese data. 4) Those which use the Chinese-language-oriented 
postfix string as the machine language. 5) In  which the high-level language itself is the 
machine language (i.e. one-level language). This type of data processing system has no 
intermediate language, no assembly language, no relocatable language, and no  absolute 
language.

The technology f o r  the computer processing of Chinese characters on a large scale is almost 
around the corner. The major bottleneck is the training required to key in 5,000 different 
Chinese characters quickly and  correctly by either a set of keyboards o r  some cleverly 
combined coded form o r  keyboard design. Advances in LSI technology. mechanical or 
magnetic keys, CRT, etc., will all contribute to the realilation of a d3t3 processing system 
capable of handling ideographic languages. An automatic pattern recognition system was not 
chosen to  represent the major future trend because its technical development is still b'eyond 
the level of practical large scale implementation.

This book describes a theory of man/man or  madmachine  conversations and cognitive 
processes (with emphasis upon the dynamics of learning and teaching at an individual level) 
together with several special experimental methods and practical applications. Most of the 
illustrations and data supporting the argument stem from education, course design, and 
similar fields and the material is relevant to epistemology, subject matter organis:~tion, as well 
as such disciplines as pedagogy, computer aided instruction etc. Some experiments, however, 
deal with laboratory learning and the acquisition of perceptual motor skills, and an attempt is 
made to identify the theory and methods wrth inany standard paradigms in social and 
experimental psychology. An  account of consciousness and self-reference is given in the

proper pronunciations, and how to translate into a foreign language. and features dynamic 
display of characters. The system can also perform text-editing operations. Techniques for 
Chinese character representation, based on chain codes fo r  stroke sequence, and dictionary 
generation, i n  which each character of subcharacter is represented as a subroutine i n  the 
dictionary, are introduced. Text-edi ti ng routines are discussed and the paper concludes With 
an illustrations of text-editing operations. The final edited text can be transcribed from the 
display scope for making hard copies. The system will be further developed for editing maps,

Time-domain speech compression using the SDA (sample, discard, about) procedure a t  
compression ratios of 0.25 to 0.75 is studied by means of a new analog speech processor and 
minicomputer algorithms. Fourier transform methods have been used to establish a 
correspondence between the quality of  the reconstructed compressed speech waveforms and the 
subjective recognition of compressed speech. The result of two psychoacot~stic experiments 
indicate that 1) the interruption frequency should be equal to  the pitch frequency of  the 
voice waveform f o r  optimum recognition of the compressed speech, and 2) smoothing of the 
discontinuities with electronic techniques significantly improves the recognition of the 
compressed speech. The  optimum smoothing parameters, window width and characteristic 
function, are also obtained from this study.

The loci of formant frequency patterns of vowels i n  many kinds of CVC contexts were 
represented in  FI-F? space. The areas enclosing these loci were obtained for  each vowel. 
The positions of vobels i n  connected speech lie inside an area surrounded by the isolated 
vowels because of the neutralization s f  vowels io connected speech. The faster the speaking 
r3 c, the more the areas tend to concentrate deeper inside. Also, the areas of individual 
vowels overlap each other and the Caster the speaking rate, the more the overlapping areas 
increase. The overlapping areas were estimated in FI-F2 space and, to investigate the effect 
of F in F1;F2-FJ space. The distribution of F is nearly approximated by the normal 
densi ? y funct~on,  because the effect on imbalance o? the vowel occurrence frequencies is not 
clearly observed in the frequency distribution of F3. Areas reflecting the bound of 
articulatory movement in the acoustic domain were obtained from the loci of formant 
frequencies represented i n  F1-FZ and FI-F3 spaces. We conclude with a comparison of the 
discussed areas and those obtained from the artlculatsry model by Lindblorn.

A general theory of epoch extraction d overlapping nonidentical waveforms is presented and 
applied to outputs of models of voiced speech production (model 1, impirlse excitation of a 
two-resonator system; model 2, glottal wave excitation of a two-resonator system) and to 
actual speech data. Some typical glottal waveshapes are considered to explain their effect of 
the speech output. The points of excitation of the vocal tract can be precisely identified for  
continuous speech and it is possible to obtain accurate pitch information by this method even 
for high-prtched sounds.

peaks in the negative of the second derivative of the spectrum. A relationship was found 
between the bandwidth of a resonance and the magnitude of the second derivative peak. 
Data. accumulated f rom a total of about  two minutes of running speech f r o m  both female

Using a method for  correcting garbled words based on Levenshtein distance and weighted 
Levenshtein distance we can correct substi trrtion errors, insertior~ errors, ar~d delection errors. 
According to the results of computer simulation on nearly 1000 high occurrence English 
words, higher error correcting rates can be achieved by this method thn~i  any other method 
tried to  date. Short words remain a problem; solving i t  w i l l  probably requite utilization of

T h e  formant  structure of three dipthongs, four  tense vowels, and tliree retroflex sounds was 
examined in detail f o r  possible speaker-identifying features. Formant tracks were computed 
f o r  each sound under investigation using covariance-type pitch-asynchronous linear prediction 
together with a root-finding algorithm. The  interspeaker variability of about 200 
measurements made on these formant  tracks was compared initially with intrnspeaker 
variability through the palculation of F ratios. Those with average F ratios greater than 80 
were evaluated further  with a probability-of-error criterion. Features that are potentially 
most effective in identifying speakers are the minimum second-formant value in  [ar], the 
maximum first-formant value in [ar], the maximum second-formant values of [o], a n d  [ 11. 
and the minimum third-formant value of [ ] The individual differences apparent in these 
sounds presumably depend mor t  on speaker habits than on vocal-tract anatomy. The error

The determination of an utterance's pitch contour utilizes simultaneous display ( r , ~  a 10 m s  
section-by-section basis) ~i the low-pass filtered waveform, the autocorrelation of a 400- 
point segment of the wideband recording. For each of the separate displays (i.e., waveform, 
autocorrelation, and cepstrum) an independent estimate o f  the pitch period is made on  an 
interactive basis with the computer, and the final pitch period decision is made by the user 
based on  results of each of the meacurements. Formal tests of the method were made in 
which f o u r  people were asked to  use the method on lhree different iltterances, and their 
results were then compared. During voiced regions, the standard deviation i n  the value of the 
pitch period was about 0.5 samples across the f o u r  people. The standard deviation of the 
location of the t ime a t  which voiced regions became uilvoiced, and vice versa was on the 
order of a half a section duration, or 5 ms. The major limitation of the proposed method i s  
that it requires about 30 min to  analyze 1 s of speech.

The system has three portions: pitch extraction, segmentation, formant  analysis. The  pitch 
extractor uses an adaptive digital filter in time-domain transforming the speech signal into a 
signal similar to the glottal waveform. Using the levels of the speech signal and the 
differenced signal as parameters in tim,e domain, the subsequent segmentation algorithm 
derives a signal parameter which describes the speed of articulatory nlovenient. From this. 
the signal is divided into "stationary" and "transitional" segments; one stationary segment is 
associated to one phoneme. For the formant  tracking procedure a subset of the pitch periods 
is selected by the seglnentation algorithm and is t ransfor~ned into freque~icy domain. The 
formant  tracking algorith111 uses a niaximum detection strategy and continnity criteria for 
adjacent spectra. After this step the total parameter set is offered to  an adaptive universal 
pattern classifier which is trained by selected nlaterial before working. For sationary 
phonemes. the recognition rate is about 85 percent when training material a d  test material 
are uttered by the same speaker. The  recognition rate is increased to about 90 percent when 
segmentation results are used.

Pauses are used to  delimit utterances into segments. Linear regression analysis of pitch 
patterns allows a 4-way classification of slopes of lines: fast rising, rising, level, falling. 
These are the 4 Fundamental Pattern Features (FPF). A combination of 2 or  3 (of the 4) 
FPF's per segment of utterance is a pitch pattern (80 possible). An intonation pattern is a 
c o m ~ i i ~ a t i o n  of pitch patterns. The position of the highest frequency v d u e  in the utterance 
is important. In comparing 2 utterances. if the high point occurs in different segments the 
intonations are contrastive even if the pitch patterns are the same. Of the 80 possible pitch 
patterns, some must be recognized as cardinal patterns and same as cognate patterns to  the  
cardinal patterns. Different sets of rules must be used f o r  the "high" segment and the final 
segment of the utterance.

Two measures of performance of speech spectra classif ication--accuracy and stabil i ty--were 
derived through the use of an automatic performance evaluation system. Over 3000 hand- 
labelled spectra were used. The most si~ccessful classification i~iethod involved a linearly- 
mean-corrected minimum distance measure, on a 30-point spectral representation with a 
square (or  cube) norm. Straight minimum distance is the worst performer. The question of 
appropriate point representation is really one of adequate information retention. The SO- 
point representation contains too many components above 3 k H z  while 20- and 10-point 
representations contain insufficient information relative to the classes to be discriminated. 
The value of the norm exponent primarily relates to the weight given extrerrla in the norm 
kernel; a heavier weighting (2  o r  3) should be placed on extrerna.

The machine recognition of Mandarin mono-syllables seems to be feasible a t  the present. An 
integrated recognition procedure of monosyllable utterances has also been suggested, and some 
results are described. The basic syllable structure contains three major parts: initial, tone, and 
final. The initial contains only consonantal phonemes of four different categories: sonorant, 
plosive, fricative, aspirate. There a re four tonemes in Mandarin Chinese; the pitch con tours 
cover only the final part of the syllable. In the vowel part of a syllable, although seven 
phonen~es are sufficient to describe all possible vowels, the final can also con tuin dipthorigs 
and tripthongs composed of more than one vowel phoneme. An itegrated recognition 
procedure of monosyllable utterances has been suggested, and some results are reported.

The system for producing consonants is  a noise generator followed by a pole-zero resonator. 
while that for producing vowels is a quasi-periodic pulse generator with variable period 
followed by a resonator with three variable poles called formant frequencies, ranging f rorn 0 
to 3 KHz. The results of analyzing, by means of sonagrams obtained from ten male voices, 
show that the 16 vowel phonemes can be classified into two classes as single and compounded 
vowel sounds. Some of the synthesized single vowels are very monotonic and can be 
recognized. Others, with third formant frequency slightly greater than 3 K H z  are not as 
clear, due to the fast decaying of high frequency components in the generated pulses. The 
compounded vowels are also synthesized by a step variation of formant frequency derived 
from its components. The result is also well recognizable. The sonogram analysis of a 
continuous Chinese speech shows that every word and its spelling phonemes are quite 
independent and separable, and are therfore very different from English speech.

In design of 10 systems f o r  human graphics i t  is necessary to  simulate the activi!,, of writing 
and not the  graphic result of that activity. Orthographic rules are  essentially sets of criteria 
f o r  determining proper seriul order of graphic signs, upon which further suhsets of phonetic, 
semantic, graphic and  other conventions are imposed. Chinese orthogriiphy is of the 
polyalternnting polyvariable type in  which a nunlber of undefined subsets of graphic signs 
conibine with each other in any of several possible juxtnpusitional nludcs according to  rules 
not yet fully elucid:~tcd. But if tile logography is not converted to un in~rarinble series it 
cannot be input to, m;~nipul;~tcd in ,  o r  outpul f rom a digital compt~tt .r ,  The temporal series 
in which elements are coriiposed into logograph$ is variably serial, and  therefore computer 
conipatible. Graphemic synthesis is a procedure by which logographs are niechanically 
produced in a manner simulating the nwnla1 writing procedure. Since logographs are  
synthesized f rom a sn~:lll f ini te  set of coriiponent elements, there is no need to prestore 
logographs, but only the small grapheme set. Output  in normal l o g ~ g r ~ i p h g  is achieved as 
needed only a t  the output end by reve.rs;ll of the synthesizing process. I t  is possible to 
achieve a synthesis a t  somewhat less than the ideal level, pseudographemic s-vnthesis, and this 
has been implemented in the SlNCO system.

A Chinese character can be thought of as cornposed fro111 a set of straight line segn~ents. A 
stroke is ideally a line segnlent or  a cuncntenation oh sevcrnl straight line segments. Fach 
straight line segment has its starting point. direction and length. Therc is also a specified 
sequence among these segments. The specified sequence of line segments for  a character is 
the same as the seq'uence of th'eir starting points. Therefore, when a character is drawn on 
the tablet of the hgitizer,  the output paper tape containing the (x,y) coordinates of sa~nyling 
points of each of its line segments presents these points in the proper order. The 
preprocessor produces a sequence of siniglif'ied straight line segments, each with a direction 
code and length, from the paper tape input, and sends the results to the classifier which 
constructs 3 dictionary of characters which it then uses in the recognition process. The 
program achieved 95% recognition for  a test sample of 300 Chinese characters.

A Chinese character may be called a kind of block picture. Each stroke seems to be a 
hieroglyph. Curves formed by several strokes or  by a continous stroke do not happen very 
often. Sorne characters only differ by a single stroke. If the Markovian processes mentioned 
in this paper are used, detailed recognition for each row and colunin is available and even a 
single stroke would not be missed absolutely, so the increasing the degree of correct 
recognition is by no  means a proi~lem. A plane block picture may be divided i'nto plane 
blocks while a solid one can be discussed by dividing it into solid blocks. The greater the 
number of layers, the higher the degree of correct recognition. The input. pattern is divided 
into 20 layers for individual recognition. If every layer satisfied the condition, then 
recognition is complete. If one of the layers has a great difference, then the pattern should 
be another picture.

Facilitate Other Related P,pplications. The  input of Chinese characters is through ti]: use of

single Chinese character varies f rom a lower limit of three to a maximum of eight. A single 
Chinese character requires a maximum. of three phonetic symbols and one intonation notation 
to indicate pronunciation. By coupling one to four of  fifteen orthographical symbols with 
the pronunication symbols, each Chinese character can be uniquely transcribed into a set  of 
symbols which indicates the pronunciation as well as the orthographical structure of the 
ideosraphy. No new hardware is required f o r  implen~entation. With some minor

A typing Keyboard is proposed which is arranged like a n  English teletypewriter, using an 8- 
unit code as i n  a n  ASCII code with even parity Switching a lever key, you will be able to 
type Chinese or English. W h e ~  you type Chinese, you need only to push a key three tirnes at 
most to con~plete the selection of a character. Then the character will come out by pushing 
the space bar once. If it is so arranged as to push a key three times for all characters, we 
shall be able to save the process of pushing the space bar for every character. The rules of 
decomposing Chinese characters are studied. The key layout of the keyboard is so arranged 
as to make recog~ition of key position easy. Four simple typing rules have been determined. 
There are only 21, out of the 3,000 characters which often appear i n  current newspapers, that 
share the same 3 keyed codes, and so they have been treated as exceptions.

Different Chinese characjers may have the same phonetic transcription (using Chinese 
National Phonetic Symbols), requiring methods to disambiguate homonyms. If however, the 
Chinese text is coded into phrases separated by delimiters. then the phrases can often be 
decoded unambiguously to obtain tht corresponding string of Chinese characters. The file 
structure for the PEACE system consists of a character file and a phrase file. Chinese 
characters are stored in the form of a composition rule. The phonetic encoding method has 
also proved to be quite satisfactory, especially for the generation and editing of Chinese texts, 
where more than 60% of the characters are embeded in phrases. Character encoding rates of 
the order of 30 characters per minute can be attained with this system.

Chinese characters maybe defined as objects produced by a generative grammar suitably 
extended to two din~ensions. At the heart of this extension is the coordinate-free 
configuration operator which. together wi th  its inflections, permits the desired stroke linking 
to compose a given character. The character so generated corresponds then t s  a derivation- 
tree which reveals structural properties common wi th  other characters. This tree in turn leads 
to a quasi-algebraic expression for the character which can be coded to give character 
indexing for storage and retrieval purposes. The recognition problem is considered briefly. 
Some experimental results with a character design language are presented.

The distribution of a word in a text can be described in  two ways. by the mariner i n  which it 
differs from that in some other texts and by the manner in  which it varies from one part of 
the text to another, Thematic words are those which stand out in comparison with a given 
background. The use of the proper statistical techniques (a measure due to Hassler- 
Goransson which is defined as the chi-square value divided by the number of degrees of 
freedom is suggested) makes i t  possible to study the way in  which words enter and leave the 
scene in a pattern which characterizes the text in  mircl~ the satlie way as the intrclt s and 
exit s determine a play, Using more sopliisticated methods it is possible to study the strength 
of connection between any two parts of the text and a segmentation of the text into 
internally mote strongly connected and mutually more loosely connected portions can be 
tested or even tnechanically suggested.

"Senses" a re  represented separately f r o m  "wordings" and the mutual connections between them 
are made explicit in both directions, "Wordings" may be either single words o r  multi-word 
phrases which are on the same foot ing with regard to "sense" connections. Each word is 
associated with an exhai~stive list of the phr:\ses in which i t  occurs. Classifiers and features, 
drawn froni appropriate sets, may be attributed separately to words, to phrases, to senses, or 
to  particular senses of words or  phrases (i.e. to particular wordings of senses). The  data items 
which represerlt scnses are globally chained, and may be exhaustively listed. The dnt;\ itenis 
which represent words ore accessible as "le;lves" of a lexical tree and may be retrieved either 
by lookup  o r  vol r~n  teered i n  alphabetical order. The  "senses" represented in  this dictionary 
are not  a set of primitives into which I~urn;~n experience can be decomposed; meaning is still 
a step removed, still evoked rather than embodied by the elements of this basis. In a full-  
f l e d ~ e d  system f u r  natural language processing the "dictionary o f  senses" could be envisioned 
as a component stretching vertically across the "upper" layers. The "sense drlta items" must 
link to  th'e deeper-lying data structures which encode "knowledge of the world."

A collection of English language data based on free associcition is organized as a network: 
node = word, arc = associative frequency. We obtained 100 responses f o r  each of 8,400 
words; the net has 56,000 nodes. For  each of  35,000 words we can obtain an environment of 
related words a n d  this environment is fairly large and relevant in content for  8400 s t imi~lus  
words. The  environment can be clustered into subsets, which turn ou t  to  be a semantic 
sorting of the environment. The search can be forward (stimulus to associate), inverse, or in  
both directions. Since growing environments can produce ponderously large subsets of  
network, environments are l in~i ted  by techniques involving transmittance to each node, the 
number of paths traversed which lead to  each node, path length, and a frequency cut-off. It 
seems better to consider forward and  inverse environments separately.

Stochastic context-free langyiges as models of NL. A senttnce is parsed first and 
transformed into a sentence dtrivstion, and then this derivation, expressed as a string of 
results of "productions," is coded by coding each production. For this coding procedure, it  is 
shown that* if the productions are divided into groups of the same left-hand side and if each 
production group is 'Huffman-coded, then the mean code length is less than the sum of the 
entrop,y and the mean number of steps of sentence derivations. Futliermore. under certain 
conditions this code becomes optinial i n  the sense that the mean code length and the entropy 
coincide, that is, there is no uniquely decodable code with shorter mean code length.

Stochastic Context-Free Grammar and Markov Chain

A stochastic context-free grammar (scfg) is an automaton which stops when a sentence is 
generated. However, in investigating the information theoretic properties of a long text is 
convenient to use a scfg-based system which returns to the start symbol and begins the 
eeneration of another sentence as soon as it  completes the generation on one sentence. The C 
system becomes a Markov chain having the set of all derivations as the state space, which is 
called hece the Markov chain associated with an scfg It turns out that: 1)  The Markov chain 
assoicated with an scfg is irreducible. 2 )  For the chain to be recurrent i t  is necessary and 
sufficient that the language generated by the scfg be a probability space. 3) For the chain to 
be positive recurrent, it is necessary and sufficient that the mean number of steps of the 
sentence derivations be finite. 4) It is well known that when a Markov chain is positive 
recurrent it has an invariant distribution and its entropy per step HI is defined. If an scfg 
satisfies certain conditions, we have HI = H(E)/(M(E) + 1).

Beckniann's error-detecting code model for the structure of natural languages is used in a 
simple efficient procedure f o r  generating a large number of English sentences with simple 
gramni;~ticnl structure atid a high rate of word repetition--such as dingrioslic messages of  a 
compiler, messages i n  interactive systems, etc. The prarnmar dcscri bed is irnplerntln ted with a 
state table with S states: Article. Numeral, Adjective. N o u n ,  Conjunc(ion, Preposition, Verb, 
Auxiliary Verb. The  syntactic type of the varius words is specified by the  location of the 
entry i n  the dictionary. Sentences a r e  formed by supplying the routine wi th  a sequence of 
poillters to  dictionary entries; the routine itself checks wlirther this is a possible sentence, 
calculates the correct check morphemes, and puts a period a t  the end.

Linguistic Inquiry 6:  203-300, Spring 1975 
A truth-definition (in the manner of  Tarski) o r  something to  the sanie effect must be a par1 
of  any adequate semantic theory. The syntax of a Montague grammar is a simultaneous 
recursive definit ion of all of the syntactic categories of the language, For  every syntactic 
category there must be a unique corresponding semantic category and f o r  every syntactic rule 
that combines (operates on)  phrases of categories A and B t o  produce a category C, there 
nilst be a unique senian tic rule that operates on the corresponding semantic interpretation t o  
give a semantic interpretation f o r  t he  resulting phrase; that interpretation will be of t h e  
semantic category corresponding to the syntactic category C. Techniques involving labelled 
bracketing and "starred variables" enable the additions of transformations to Montague 
grammars.

Words and semantic primitives a re  not utimalely of different types, although procedural 
benefits come fro111 making the distinction. Plans stated in high level progranlrrling languages 
are most appropriately scen as texts, since they do  riot seen] to he either real world procedures 
or  procedures for handliog natural language, As a pe~leral n ~ e r h o d  of pursing nafural 
language. expectation is radically defective ilnless it has  some general slid svs te~i~at ic  capacity 
for  attending to  what i t  is rending. The  important d i s t~nc t ion  b e t w e n  catlses and reasons in 
the esplnnation of hum;tn behnvior should have procedur;ll and not only t : lsono~i~ic  rcflction 
in an underst;lnding system. Tenipl:\te to tenlplnte (in preferential setnan t ics) inference rules 
are: GOAL, CAUSE. IM1'IL.IC. The CAUSE/GOAL distinction often rstuces to no niore than 
the temporal directionnlity of the rule. Real world knowledge can be represented quite 
usefully at  quite local levels in an llnderstanding and can function there as part of a general 
systeni of l i t~guistic inference. T h e  use of frames threattns to swamp us in large f rame 
structures for  relatively trivial nlatters ; ~ n d  it is not cleilr how frames are rrlr1tt.d Io lower 
level structures. We need m u l t i i e ~ e l  represen!:tion. It is not at all obvious that a N L

Some of the arguments which have been given both fo r  and against the use of natural 
languages in  qnestioning-answering ( Q A )  systems are  discussed. The following systems are 
considered in evaluatingr the current level of Q A  system development: LSNLIS, REL, 
SHRDLU. REQUEST There is a trade-off between syntactic and semantic complexity. A 
yystem with relatively simple syntactic capabilities must have complex semantic analysis 
procedures while a system, such as REQUEST, with sophisticated syntax can produce 
i~nderlying syntactic structures which directly reflect meaning without the need f o r  "creative" 
interpretation. A brief comparison between processing times in LSN LlS and REQUEST is 
given.

Question Answering in a Story Understanding System 
Wendy Lehnert 
Deparrmenl of Computer Science, Yale University 
Research Report 57, December 1975 
This theory of question answering is based on the SAM (Script Applier Mechanism) 
mechanism. In the interpretative phase i t  takes a question in  Conceptual Dependency form 
and categorizes i t  i n  terms of particular question types: 1) why. 2) how, 3) yes or no, 4) 
occurrence, 5) component. Each question type corresponds to a specific form of CD 
representation. In  the response phase the memory is searched for the answer; this may 
involve nothing more than simple inforni:itioi~ retrieval or i t  may entail inferring the answer 
using gener;ll knowledge of the world. The systenl tries for co~npleteness in  answering; a 
yes/no q\~estion will be answered with yes or no plus an account of that answer. Work is 
being done on a Generation-Selection paradigm in which each question generates a number 
of feasible answers (the problem of memory representation) and a selection procedure chooses 
among them (pure QA). Selection rules are presented and discussed.

The 'text-structure-world-structure theory' (TeSWeST) is an empirically motivated logic- 
oriented theory aiming at  the gramn~atical description of a text as a con~plex sign (intensional 
semantic description) and the assignment of the possible extensional interpretations to the 
intensional-semantically described text structure (extensional-semantic theory). The 
intensional-semantic and extensional-semantic descriptions are si~ch that they also contain the 
description of the pragmatic' aspects. The grammatical component of the TeSWeST is a 
generative transformational text grammar operating with linearly not fixed canonic basic 
structur? The formation rule system of this grammar consists of a o-called comn~unicative E rule (R ) expressed informally as: A communicative basis (TB ) is a communicative 
predicate-complex: a communicator (C1) communicates (COMM) to a (potential) 
b * t  * 1 communisator/interpreter (C ) at a given tlme ( Q ) i n  a given place ( Q ) the message TB. The elements of the norme implicit representation of the text intension are definienda i n  
the lexicon and the elements of the normed explicir repxsentation of the text intension are 
definientes in  the lexicon. The task of the extensional semantic component is to assign 
possible extensional semantic interpretations to the possible i n  tensional semantic 
representations.

(1) Winograd's approach to language has forced a reeval. ~tiotr  of the relationship between the 
theory of competence and the study of  performance, pragmatics, etc., though it is still wise to  
ack'nowledge the descr i~pt ion of language as a relatively i ~ ~ d e p e n d e n t  enterprise. (2 )  The use 
of lingi~istics descriptions in A1 provides a test f o r  l~nguis t ic  theories. (3 )  Winograd's 
"imperative form" of  representing knowledge and semantics is more effective than one based 
entirely on deductive logic. Considerations of topic and focus, theme and rhemt., furictional 
sentence perspective, etc. are siniilnrly "imperative" i n  their  (:niphasis or) the dirfrrcli t  use^" 
which various iteriis of information in a comniunicntion hint. .  (4)  Wiriogr;ld's work ,  i n  his

A multilevel data structure has been developed to allow its use to  construct graphical symbols 
on a automated d ~ a f t i n g  machine. The  implemented logic allows a user to define several sets 
of  alphanumerical characters and graphical symbols in terms of three levels of tables f o r  
creating and retrieving the needed line segment strokes. It is believed that the same logic 
c o d d  be applied to  provide a solution to the computer output of Chinese characters. To call 
any desired Chinese tharacter as output, it is simply a matter of calling the character's legal 
designator within a particular library.

Treating Chinese characters as pictures we can display them on the screen without difficulty. 
Subroutines are written to generate each word or part of the word. On ttre input side, one 
can use a light-pen on the appropriate part of the screen to choose which part of the 
program one wants to go to, e.h, go to next frame, delete this point, etc. A push of the 
designated function key switch will also convey inforn~ation. Chernoff proposed the  napping 
of multidimensianal variables orito features of faces. Mouth, nose, eyes, facial contour, etc,, 
are modified in form and size to represent each vector of measurements, A,graphics program 
was written using this idea and extending it to provide the histogram comparison and 
interactive classification of individual cases.

Two Major Flaws in the CODASYL DDL 1973 and Proposed Corrections

I n  a schema d t t e n  in  CODASYL DDL 1973 it i s  syntactically correct to describe an entity 
either by declaring a data,item i n  the record of the entry or by declaring a CODASYL set 
type in which the record, describing the entity, is a member record. This is a major flaw 
because extension of a database or integration of two existing-databases will then lead to 
either reprogramming or inconsistency, or  both. The flaw can be corrected by 'requiring that 
all attributes are represented as a d a b  item in the (Ingical) schema. In the CODASY L DDL 
1973, there are five places to optionally declare a record identifier and four of these five 
places are not in the rncord but in  the CODASYL set type. Declaring record identifiers 
therefore results i n  fairly complex and non-orthogonal declarations. This could be simplified 
by abondoning tjtese five places and by introducing a record identifier clause in the record 
type entry. For integrity reasons i t  is necessary to require that at  least one record identifier 
is declared in every fecord type entry. The previous two corrections will make is possible to 
design a CODASY L set selection clause. still providing the same functional capabilities. The 
corrected DDL is functionally equivalent, yet offers more data independence, is simpler and 
more orthogonal. Examples are given.

Definitions should exploit the distinction between de finiendu~n and dc finiens. The def iniens 
designates a concept in context while the definiendum defines the concept wirhout dopertdence 
on context. The definiendum of one concept X1 may appear as a term in the definiens of 
another concept X2, thus permitt~ng recursive construction of defin~tions.  A machine based 
archive of soc~al  science concepts is proposed in which the core element of each entry will be 
a definition copied from relevant scholarly writings. Each entry will :ilso contain: a) a 
possible translation of the definition into English and i n t o  fornial precise language b) 
specification of related terms and relevant theoretical context, c )  docu~neiitation of the source 
OF the difinition, d )  name of the contributor, e) anything else which secnls appropriate. 
Terms found i n  the new Thesaurus of the American Political Science Associ;l\ion will be r~sed

Within a word, the ith letter is to solfie degree dependent on the i-1 letters that precede it. 
Taking advantage of this, successor and predecessor letter variety counts are used to indicate 
where words should be divided. Four segmentation strategies are used: a )  Cutoff, b) Peak and 
plateau, c )  Complete word, d )  Entropy. Experiments have been run testin2 the machine 
implementation of 'various combinations of of these strategies. A technique involving whole 
word word segmentation techniques and ciltoff points on successor and predecessor counts was 
chosen for  use in  information retrieval experiments. The information retrieval results 
obtained are virtually identical to those obtained with the more manually oriented forms of

information which is redundant across similar items to be stored at only one point in  the

values between these two points. A minimum spanning tree cor~tains a11 the points and i s  
such that i ts rots1 sun) of distances is n n i in imuni  anlong all such possible trees. Examples

A fact-retrieval system consisting of  a data base, axiom set and inference system can deduce 
answers to questions by combining a certain number of facts. A predicate symbol followed 
by a series of constant terms or variable terms and its complement is a literal. A literal 
without variable terms is a ground literal. A. clause is a logical sum of literals. A 
hierarchical fact-retrieval system is stvdied by  viewing data as a set of  clauses, each of which 
consists of a ground literal. Concrete fact-retrieval is assumed not to contain function 
symbols by limiting the objective. Under such condition efficient procedures- are given for: 
1) retrieving constant terms by specifying predicate symbois and part of the constant terms 
and. 2) retrieving predicate syn~bols and the remaining constant terms by specifying part of 
the constant terms. Futhermore, the number of comp:risons, which is the criterion for the 
retreival time in each procedure, is examined analytically and experimentally.

The. system should consist of: 1) the brain, which organizes the whole repertory of data. 2) 
the analysis, which takes, as its input, text and qlreslions i n  N L  mixed wi th  formal notations, 
and presents, as output, disambiguated translations in a language the brain can directly use, 
and 3) the synthesis, translating the answers delivered by the brain into the appropriate NL. 
The representation of the sentence on the ~ectuyranimaticnl level (the artifical language) has 
the form of a dependency graph, with the verb as its root. i l i e  pi~rticip;ints of the verb are 
ordered according to: 1) an inherent order of participants detern~ined by the language system, 
2) topiciilizat~on and comlnt~nicative dynamism, 3)  rilles of grammar. The semantic 
representation is marked ns to which elements are contextu3lly bound a13d which are not. 
The verb always stands between its con textually bound and contextually non- bound 
participants.

Synthesis of Czech i n  MT. The generative component is a context-free phrase structure and 
uses modifying, subs~itutional and selectional rules. The right-hand side of the rules cannot 
contain more than two non-terminal symbols. I'here are recursive rules. The order of 
application is determined by the form of the rule i t se l f  (by a selection of non-terminal 
synibols). The rules are not distinguished as obligatory and optional ones. The translation of 
the semantic representation to the graphemic level proceeds in two steps. First, the semantic 
representation i s  translated into a surface syntactic level, and this is then (secondly) translated 
into a morphemic representation. The sequence of computer programs is based on the formal 
pattern of pushdown transducers.

The experimental computer configurations use alphanumeric input by keyboard (and 
simulation of graphic input). Both systems depend on retrieval from a glossary file of 
Chinese characters with English meanings and  a cross r ~ f e r e n c e  f i le  of characters containing 
transliterations. The  first  set of colnputer function, p i ~ t  together is based on itie prime 
method of input by alphanumeric keyboard and graphic output fo r  displaying Chinese 
characters. The most important of these is the segmenting function, which is capable of 
searching the  glossary file for  meanings fo r  each iridividual char:lcler and,  fo r  sets of 
contiguous characters in the query string. The  system has two indexing functions: partial 
telecode indexing and Pin Yin indexing, l'he second set of coniputer aid functions are  based 
on input by Pin Yin romanization. The o p e n t o r  con type in the Pin Yin  spelling (without 
tone) fo r  a query of up to seven characters in length and the system searches the glossary f i le  
f o r  all terms that f i t  the Pin Yin. This  method is effective only f o r  con~pound  queries.

Phrase structun: grammar is supposed f o r  both English and Japanese. and a syntax to  syntax 
translation by ~ r d e r e d  context-free grammar is adopted which concerns word order exchange 
and insertion and deletion of auxiliary particles, and does not concern the semanticit1 aspect 
of translation words. The  niain part of the algorithm. syntax analysis and synthesis. is 
carried out  by using context-free type rewriting rules. These rules are classified into several 
hierarchies and there exist priorities in each hierarchy w h e l ~  rules are used. Program and 
linguistic data are separated as much as possible, so that a change of grammar does not  affect 
the main program. Therefore the program size becomes very small: about 1500 statements in  
assembler language. The word dictionary contains SO00 head words and the grammar table 
contains about 900 rewriting rules. This translation system can in principle a c w  any 
complex structure, and about 70% of sentences from scientific o r  technological papers a re  
analyzed correctly f r o m  the syntactical point of view. Results of English into Japanese 
translation can be spoken through speaker by voice synthesizer.

Rotinese chants are ordered by extensive parallelism. Each opposition in the Rotinese ritual 
language is a dyadic set. Some terms may appear in Inore t h a n  one dyadic set. Tracing 
relations among these semantic elements involves chains and cycles alorlg the edges o f  a 
symmetric graph. The analysis of 5000 lines of verse has yielded a dictionary of the ritual 
language consisting of 1000+ dyadic sets over 1400 entries. By concentratir~g on elements 
included i n  5 or more dyads  (the frequency cutoff is somewhat  arbitrary) and with at  least 2 
links i n  common a core set of 21 entries is identified. The core includes directional 
coordinates, words f o r  earth', 'water', 'rock , and 'tree" terms for plants and plant-parts, body 
parts, and a peculiar collection of verbs of position involving ideas of balance, border, ascent, 
and descent. T h i s  corc has been it~vestigated using cluster analysis programs.

The prin,ciple of causality is fundamental to human thinking. It has been observed 
experimentally that causal thinking lends to complex hypothesis formation by humall subjects 
attempting to solve comparatively simple problems involvirly acausal randon11 y generated. 
The assumption of causality in  modeling acausal systems leads to meaningless models that 
cannot reflect any stochastic structure present. This correspondence provides un automata- 
theoretic explanation of this phenomenon by analyzing the performance of an optimal 
modeler observitlg tile behavior of a system and forming a minimal-stale model of it.

T h e  language-learning theory has fou r  interrelated. aspects: (a) the class, G,  of possible 
grammars, (b) the kind. I ,  of information made available to the learner. (c) the language- 
learning procedure, P, and  (d) the criterion, C, of success. The theory must deduce a 
guarantee that the correct member. g, of G can be discovered by applying procedure P to  
information of type 1 about g. The  sense in which g is "discovered" milst be made precise by 
a formal criterion C, and the  proof must hold for arbitrary g i n  G. The system presented 
converges: that is, the learning process learns the language to a formal criterion. The claim 
that the theory is reasonable rests on the plausibility of G ,  I ,  P. and C. G the class of all 
TG's. Each element of I is a sentence coupled with its underlying structure. The procedure 
P doesn't require explicit menlory f o r  past data and must acquire the ability to map each 
phrase-marker (akin to meaning) to the apprclpriate surface structure.

Though the computer itself cannot be considered creative, the artist can use the computer in 
2 modes: 1) as an active device contributing through simulation, to the final artistic 
product..and 2) passively, like a ton1 to be nianipt~lated by the user. Once we think we 
understand the structure of a class of objects under consideration. that is, how the parts 
making up the whole are interrelated, we can actively use this information and the random 
dement to "create" objects similar to those being studied.

Free rhythm is that used in  ancient Greek and Latin prose and in the music of the early 
Middle Ages i n  Europe. An elementary arsis(AE) is an elementary time value plus a n  upbeat  
an elementary thesis(TE) is one  or two elementary time values plus a downbeat. An 
elementary rhythm(RE) 
Is: A FTf . A simple rhythm consists of a simple arsis (not [he same as an elementary a r s ~ s )  followe by a s i i i~ple  thesis. Khythnis may be recursively composed 
of other rtlythrns to form a phrase(K). A phrase is ;I result of the t~igtiest rhy~htiiical 
synthesis of the elementary time values while the ordering of phrases i s  no more an af fa i r  of 
rhythm but of stylistic form. A gr:lmmnr of free rhythm i s  an ordered 4-tuplet: G -- (V,41, 
K,  S), where V is a set of 6 terminal svnibols. V1 is a set of 13 auxiliary synlhols. K i s  a 
member of  V and is the initial symbol, and S is a set of 21 production rules. A modified 1, grarnmnr(G*) as 5 terminal symbols, 6 auxiliary symbols, and 13 prodtictioh rilles, but offers

roving Musical Theorems I: The Middleground of Heiniich Schenker's Theory 
of Tonality 
Michael Kasslcr 
Bassrr Deparrment of Cornpuler Science, School of Physics, The University of  Sydney 
Technical-Reporf No .  107, Augusf 1975 
Schen ker's theory of  tonality asserts that every composition that is an instance of tonality can 
be derived from one of  three Ursaetze' (background) by the successive application of a small 
number of rules of inference called 'p ro lon~at ion  techniques' (midd le~round) .  Harmonic: 
rhythmic, melodic, dynamic. etc. details belong to the foreground stage of derivation. Thea  
middleground rules f o r  the major mode involve two formalized lan_eus~es,  S1, which has 11 
inference rules (corresponding to Schenker's prolongation techniques), and S2. with 5 
inference rules. S1 governs dilyneor compositions (a l yne being o n e  musical voice) and  has 
three primitive axioms, while S2 governs irilvnear conipositions and contains an axiom 
structure which relstes the systems S1 and S2. The decision procedure provides one proof for  
any given theorem (i.e composition) rather than all possible proofs. At  the middle level i t  
seems that alternative minimal proofs in no  way demonstrate a semar~tically important 
ambiguity. though the situation is likely to  change significantly with the explication of 
foreground structures.

The programs deal with quadratic equations and equations of straight lines. The student, 
seated at n teletype, receives a probleni with ramdornly chosen parameters. The student then 
solves the problem and enters his solution. If his solution agrees with the computer's 
solution, then another problem is presented. If the student's solution is incorrect the 
computer then works the problem incorrectly in several different ways, each t i m e  checking its 
answer against the student's. If a match is obtained. then the computer suggest that the 
student has made a certain error and asks him to try again. If none of the incorrect answers 
match the student's answtr,  then the computer wi l l  check the student's work step by step. If 
a student requires detailed solutions to several problems, he i s  asked to contact the insttuctor.

People in W e s u n  civilization encounter great difficulty when attempting to learn the 
Chinese language. The major diff icult ies seem t o  be due  to the non-alphabetic. non-phonetic 
and pictorially-structured characters. The system described applies computers and computer 
graphics to teach the Chinese ideogram in a systematic, simple and effective manner. A set 
of LOGO procedures are defined which draw simple strokes and then these procedures are 
used as  primitive commands to construct ideograms on a CRT. one  stroke at  a time. Five 
demonstration courseware lessons are discussed to illustrate the teaching methodology.

In character coding f o r  display, the system uses a method based on "piecewise linear 
approximation" The procedure for  stroke recognition ltas three steps: 1) Tral isfor~n the 
stroke code into a "direction sequence". 2 )  Tritnsform the direction sequence into "major 
direction sequence". 3) Identify the stroke type by processing the major direction sequence 
with an automaton. The  structure of a character can be unnrnbiguously described as a 
context-free grammar with sirokes BS the terniinal elcnients of the gmnlnlnr. The 
nonterininuls include 'units' and 'components'. A unit consists of a group of closely related 
strokes and conipotirnts consist of two units o r  of two snialler colnponents. B;lsed on this 
structure, the computer builds a strclcturrd base for error analysis. This base consists of 3 set 
of rel:ition niatrices, one  for each production of its grammar.  Error detection proceeds by 
comparing entries in the relation matrices of the model character with those of  the character 
written by the student.

Technical Report 74C-2, 40 pp.  
For inieracting with the world animals and robots need a spatical framework, the ability to  
segment he world into chunks, and long-term and ghort-term models of the world. The 
ability to see what objects are in the world and to interact appropriately with the world is 
shared by all animals. Language is not a magic sepatate device to be explained by fornial 
grammars, but is rather an ability which evolved naturally out  of our ability to pe~ceive the 
world. The child's acquisition of language builds on his cognitive c:rp:icities and uses a 
strategy in  wliich he reconstructs sentences according to his own rules and proceeds by fine- 
tunirig of linguistic structures. A distrtbuted inforniatiori processing ninchine (DIPM) i s  
suggested as a theoretical lnodel in which the logic functions of the machilie are distributed 
and not centralized. Consequently no single center exists i n  which damage could lead to the 
breakdown of the whole machine. The cybernetic study of language needs a theoretical 
language which encompasses A1 work and brain theory.

In the control of nlovement, Al  offers insight into ovzr?ll planning o f  behavior: while control 
theory enables BT (Brain Theory) to model feedback and feedforward adjustments by the 
spinal cord brainstem and cerebcllum. A schema is an internal representation of an 'object' 
and comprises inpi$-marching routines, action routines, and competition and cooperation 
routinel. The internal representatioo of the world is then given by a 'collage' of tuned and 
activated schemas. A number of studies i n  Al aod BT are discussed which offer hope of a 
unified theory of competition and cooperation within a single subsj~stem. W e  then turn to 
the modelling of a set of brain regions as a cooperative compu~ation system--a distributed 
structure i n  which each system has its own 'goal structure' for selecting information to act on 
from its environment, and for  transmitting the results to suitable receivers. Finally we 
sample A l  studies of speech understanding. Of particular interest is work by the Carnegie- 
Mellon Hearsay group on n system using a network of PDP l l ' s ,  each functioning as a 
knowledge source, which interact through a communication center called a blackboard rather 
than being controlled by an executive.

Each level in a robot's control hierarchy accepts commands from the next higher level and 
responds by issuing ordered sequences of comniands to the next lower level, making use of 
sensory feedback to  close control loops where they are appropriate. At  each level feedback 
signals are sent to the next higher level and other feedback signals are r e c e i ~ e d  f rom below. 
These signals indicate the s b t e  of the rnnnipul:~tor and the environment. The type of 
feedback needed depends strorigly on the degree o f  uncertl~inty encountered in  the 
environment. Large urlccr ninties i n  the robot's world require thlrt the  upper levels of control 
structure incorporate a "world modeli' wliicti can represent the state of  the e t w i r o n n ~ r n t  i n  a 
meaningful way. When such a robot (e.g. SRl's / S h a k y )  is faced with an i n p u t  command to 
be executed, i t  tries to set up  a hypottletical desired world niodtll and then to devise a set of 
procedures that can convert the existing world nlodel in to  the desired one. Various types of 
industrial robots and experimental approaches to machine vision are briefly discussed.
