The paper descr ibes  a system ca l led  RENTTU, a co l lec t ion  
of  funct ions  fo r  computat ion of  t rans format ions  from natura l  
languages in to  severa l  types of  natura l  secret  languages such 
as P ig  Lat in  e tc .  By a natura l  secret  language,  sometimes 
ca l led  cant in  Eng l i sh  or  ch i ld ren 's  p lay  language we mean s 
natura l  language t rans format ion ,  which preserves  important  
morpho- and phono log ica l  qua l i t ies  of  the under ly ing  source 
language.  Such languages seem to make up a r i ch  cu l tu re ,  which 
i s  a mixture  of  lo re ,  l i ngu is t i cs ,  c rypto logy ,  and - i f  you 
wish - of  computing. 
Today the phenomenon l ies  probably  neares t  to fo lk lo re  
and ch i ld ren 's  cu l tu re ,  but in  ear l ie r  t imes they have, and 
perhaps s t i l l  do const i tu te  important  sk i l l s  of  the lower and 
underground wor ld .  In  the Middle Ages they were wide ly  used 
among ~ beggars ,  tramps,  ped lars ,  vagabonds, th ieves  e tc .  To 
Europe they seem to  have come through the Bysantitun from the 
East ,  where they s t i l l  today cont inue  to l i ve  an ac t ive  l i fe .  
As a l ingu is t i c  phenomenon they seem to be un iversa l  
and appear in  some form and extent  p ract i ca l l y  in  a l l  languag-  
es and cu l tu res .  Yet i t  seems that  they have a t t rac ted  l i t t le  
a t tent ion  from the  part  of  l i ngu is t i cs  or  c rypto logy .  Most of  
the  t reatments  eem to  fa l l  w i th in  SOCtOl ln~Aist ics  or  fo lk -  
l o re .  As c rypto log ica l  methods the  natura l  secret  l~age  
- 251  - 
t rans format ions  are fa i r l y  s imple and the i r  va lue  bare ly  
extends beyond the ch i ld ren 's  p layground.  Though in teres t ing -  
l y  enough they seem to we l l  meet f i ve  out of the s ix  so ca l l -  
ed Kerckhof f ' s  c r i te r ia  o f ten  used to assess  usab i l i ty  of  
c ryptograph io  methods and systems.  
A~Vhow, they  work we l l  and fu l f i l l  the i r  purpose in  
s i tuat ions  fo r  which they  are aimed fo r :  exchange of  o ra l  
messages in  rea l  t ime in  a s i tuat ion ,  where the unintended 
are  present, Since the message does not leave permanent trace, 
it is not possible to examine it afterwards. 
For linguistic research they can be valuable in that 
they exhibit some phenomena and processes on the morpho- and 
phonologlcal levels that can serve as a framework for extra- 
linguistic experimentation, 
From computing and programming point of view the sub- 
Ject is of definite 'interest, since it involves nontrIvial 
morpho- and phonological recognition, context conditions and 
t rans format ions ,  which o f fe r  an ins t ruc t ive  excerc i se  in  
linguistic progrsmming. 
Several types of families of secret languages, or rath- 
er classes of language transformations, are identified. The 
typology can be categorized as follows: 
I. Syllabic transformations, which may involve deletions, 
replications, insertions or substitutions of syllables or 
phonemic elements under certain contextual conditions. 
2. Transformations that involve syllable permutations, possib- 
ly intermixed with transformations of the above type. 
3e Types of transformations, which involve nonsyllabic splitt- 
ing of words in to  segments that  ere  in terchanged wi th  
segments of  a g iven  key word or  wi th those of  the  next 
word. 
F ina l ly  some hybr id  types  occur ,  which combine features  
of  var ious  types  in  one language.

Q 
As an example a deta i led  ana lys i s  i s  g iven  of the Kont t i  
language,  which i s  wide ly  known in  F in land and  belongs to  the 
th i rd  category .  In  Kont t i  the sp l i t  po int  i s  determined by a 
number of  ru les ,  ~hich are cond i t ioned  by some metr i c  and 
prosod ic  features  together  w i th  the vowel consonant s t ruc ture  
o f  the two words. The t rans format ions  invo lve  both durat iona l  
and harmonic accommodations to p reserve  the  metr i c  qua l i t ies  
and to  meet the vowel harmony laws in  P inn ish .  
Most de l i ca te  ru les  and cond i t ions  are  found in  sp l i t t -  
ing  c r i te r ia  concern ing var ious  k inds of  d iphtong,  vowel pa i r  
and long vowel combinat ions ,  in  which the F inn ish  language i s  
fa i r l y  r i ch .  Some cases  take  rea l  ear  fo r  the l~age  to  be 
cor rec t ly  reso lved ,  but a l l  ru les  and cond i t ions  can, as soon 
as they have become c lear ly  es tab l i shed ,  be programned. Thus 
a full competence of the Konnti language can be implemented 
on the computer. 
Prom the linguistic point of view the transformations 
are interesting in the sense that they fully preserve the 
phono- and morphological weli-formedness of the underlying 
language, i.e. the resulting words and word forms could well 
be real substance of the source language. 
Another notable feature is that the reverse transform- 
ation based on the same set and order of rules restores the 
original words and word forms except for certain degenerate 
cases, which involve neutral vowels that are incapable of 
? receiving information about harmonic quality when it is 
char~ed. 
P resent ly  the RENTTU system accounts  fo r  some 20 lan -  
guages known in  F in land inc lud ing  some based on Swedish. I t  
cons i s ts  of  a co l lec t ion  of  some 50 neat  LISP funct ions  
wr i t ten  in  a pure ly  funct iona l  s ty le .  The funct iona l  s ty le  
of  programming i s  not only we l l  su i ted  or app l i cab le  to  the 
problem, but a l so  c lear ly  re f lec ts  the nature  of  both the 
- 253 - 
l i ngu?st ie  and the computat iona l  aspects  of  the  processes  
invo lved .  I t  a l so  resu l t s  in  e legant  and conc ise  funct ion  
de f in i t ions .  The author  would be grate fu l  o f  any mater ia l  o r  
observat ions  concern ing  such languages  in  o ther  count r ies .  
The system has been implemented in  INTERLIEP on the  TeKoLa 
DECSystem-20 and is available as a listing from the author 
on request.
