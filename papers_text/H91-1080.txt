OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this basic research is to 
develop imProved methods and models for acoustic 
recognition of continuous peech. The work has 
focussed on developing accurate and detailed 
mathematical models of phonemes and their 
coarticulation for the purpose of large-vocabulary 
continuous speech recognition. Important goals of 
this work are to achieve the highest possible word 
recognition accuracy in continuous peech and to 
develop methods for the rapid adaptation of 
phonetic models to the voice of a new speaker. 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
? Developed context-dependent phonetic models 
based on the hidden Markov modeling (HMM) 
formalism to describe the acoustic variability 
of speech due to coarticulation with 
neighboring phonemes. The method resulted 
in a reduction of the word error rate by a factor 
of two over using context-independent models. 
Developed and demonstrated the effectiveness 
of the "time-synchronous" search strategy for 
finding the most likely sequence of words, 
given the input speech. 
? Incorporated the various techniques in a 
complete continuous speech recognition 
system, called BYBLOS, and demonstrated it 
first in 1986. The basic methodology of 
BYBLOS has since been adopted by other 
DARPA sites. It was, and continues to be, the 
highest-performing continuous recognition 
system for large vocabularies. When tested on 
the DARPA Resource Management Corpus 
with a grammar of perplexity 60, the word 
error rate is less than 2% for speaker-dependent 
recognition and less than 4% for speaker- 
independent recognition. 
Initial experiments with this model on context- 
independent phonetic units reduced the 
recognition error by a factor of two compared 
to the corresponding context-independent 
HMM models. However, the new method 
requires ignificantly more computation. 
Developed a novel "probabilistic spectral 
mapping" technique for rapid speaker 
adaptation whereby the phonetic models of a 
new speaker are estimated by performing a
transformation on the phonetic models of a 
reference speaker, using only a small amount 
of speech from the new speaker. Using this 
technique, the recognition accuracy with only 2 
minutes of training from the new speaker is 
equal to that usually achieved with 20 minutes 
of speaker-dependent training or with speaker- 
independent training (which requires peech 
from over 100 speakers). 
With multiple reference models, the error rate 
with speaker adaptation is cut in half relative 
to the single-reference ase. This constitutes 
the first time that speaker adaptation has been 
successful in improving performance over a 
speaker-independent system. 
A new paradigm for speaker-independent 
training has been developed. Instead of using 
speech from over 100 speakers, the new 
method uses 30 minutes from each of only a 
dozen speakers. This new, more practical, 
paradigm promises to be the key to future 
developments in improved speaker-independent 
recognition. 
Developed a new formalism for phonetic 
modeling, called "stochastic segment 
modeling", which can model the correlation 
between different parts of a phoneme directly.
