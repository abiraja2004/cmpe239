Abstract
Social Media contain a multitude of user
opinions which can be used to predict real-
world phenomena in many domains in-
cluding politics, finance and health. Most
existing methods treat these problems as
linear regression, learning to relate word
frequencies and other simple features to
a known response variable (e.g., voting
intention polls or financial indicators).
These techniques require very careful fil-
tering of the input texts, as most Social
Media posts are irrelevant to the task. In
this paper, we present a novel approach
which performs high quality filtering au-
tomatically, through modelling not just
words but also users, framed as a bilin-
ear model with a sparse regulariser. We
also consider the problem of modelling
groups of related output variables, us-
ing a structured multi-task regularisation
method. Our experiments on voting inten-
tion prediction demonstrate strong perfor-
mance over large-scale input from Twitter
on two distinct case studies, outperform-
ing competitive baselines.
1 Introduction
Web Social Media platforms have ushered a new
era in human interaction and communication. The
main by-product of this activity is vast amounts of
user-generated content, a type of information that
has already attracted the interest of both marke-
teers and scientists because it offers ? for the first
time at a large-scale ? unmediated access to peo-
ples? observations and opinions.
One exciting avenue of research concentrates
on mining interesting signals automatically from
this stream of text input. For example, by exploit-
ing Twitter posts, it is possible to infer time series
that correlate with financial indicators (Bollen et
al., 2011), track infectious diseases (Lampos and
Cristianini, 2010; Lampos et al, 2010; Paul and
Dredze, 2011) and, in general, nowcast the magni-
tude of events emerging in real-life (Sakaki et al,
2010; Lampos and Cristianini, 2012). Other stud-
ies suggest ways for modelling opinions encap-
sulated in this content in order to forge branding
strategies (Jansen et al, 2009) or understand vari-
ous socio-political trends (Tumasjan et al, 2010;
O?Connor et al, 2010; Lansdall-Welfare et al,
2012). The main theme of the aforementioned
works is linear regression between word frequen-
cies and a real-world quantity. They also tend to
incorporate hand-crafted lists of search terms to
filter irrelevant content and use sentiment analy-
sis lexicons for extracting opinion bias. Conse-
quently, they are quite often restricted to a specific
application and therefore, generalise poorly to new
data sets (Gayo-Avello et al, 2011).
In this paper, we propose a generic method that
aims to be independent of the characteristics de-
scribed above (use of search terms or sentiment
analysis tools). Our approach is able to explore
not only word frequencies, but also the space of
users by introducing a bilinear formulation for
this learning task. Regularised regression on both
spaces allows for an automatic selection of the
most important terms and users, performing at the
same time an improved noise filtering. In addi-
tion, more advanced regularisation functions en-
able multi-task learning schemes that can exploit
shared structure in the feature space. The latter
property becomes very useful in multi-output re-
gression scenarios, where selected features are ex-
pected to have correlated as well as anti-correlated
impact on each output (e.g., when inferring voting
intentions for competing political parties).
We evaluate our methods on the domain of
politics using data from the microblogging ser-
vice of Twitter to infer voting trends. Our pro-
993
posed framework is able to successfully predict
voting intentions for the top-3 and top-4 parties
in the United Kingdom (UK) and Austria respec-
tively. In both case studies ? bound by differ-
ent characteristics (including language, time-span
and number of users) ? the average prediction er-
ror is smaller than 1.5% for our best model using
multi-task learning. Finally, our qualitative analy-
sis shows that the models uncover interesting and
semantically interpretable insights from the data.
2 Data
For the evaluation of the proposed methodologies
we have created two data sets of Social Media con-
tent with different characteristics based in the UK
and Austria respectively. They are used for per-
forming regression aiming to infer voting intention
polls in those countries. Data processing is per-
formed using the TrendMiner architecture for So-
cial Media analysis (Preot?iuc-Pietro et al, 2012).
2.1 Tweets from users in the UK
The first data set (we refer to it as Cuk) used in
our experimental process consists of approx. 60
million tweets produced by approx. 42K UK Twit-
ter users from 30/04/2010 to 13/02/2012. We as-
sumed each user to be from the UK, if the location
field in their profile matched with a list of com-
mon UK locations and their time zone was set to
G.M.T. In this way, we were able to extract hun-
dreds of thousands of UK users, from which we
sub-sampled 42K users to be distributed across the
UK geographical regions proportionally to their
population figures.1
2.2 Tweets for Austria
The second data set (Cau) is shorter in terms of
the number of users involved (1.1K), its time span
(25/01 to 01/12/2012) and, consequently, of the
total number of tweets considered (800K). How-
ever, this time the selection of users has been made
by Austrian political experts who decided which
accounts to monitor by subjectively assessing the
value of information they may provide towards
political-oriented topics. Still, we assume that the
different users will produce information of varying
quality, and some should be eliminated entirely.
However, we emphasise that there may be smaller

potential gains from user modelling compared to
the UK case study. Another important distinction
is language, which for this data set is primarily
German with some English.
2.3 Ground Truth
The ground truth for training and evaluating our
regression models is formed by voting intention
polls from YouGov (UK) and a collection of Aus-
trian pollsters2 ? as none performed high fre-
quency polling ? for the Austrian case study.
We focused on the three major parties in the
UK, namely Conservatives (CON), Labour (LAB)
and Liberal Democrats (LBD) and the four ma-
jor parties in Austria, namely the Social Demo-
cratic Party (SPO?), People?s Party (O?VP), Free-
dom Party (FPO?) and the Green Alternative Party
(GRU?). Matching with the time spans of the data
sets described in the previous sections, we have
acquired 240 unique polls for the UK and 65 polls
for Austria. The latter have been expanded to
98 polls by replicating the poll of day i for day

i ? 1 where possible.3 There exists some inter-
esting variability towards the end for the UK polls
(Fig. 1a), whereas for the Austrian case, the main
changing point is between the second and the third
party (Fig. 1b).
3 Methods
The textual content posted on Social Media plat-
forms unarguably contains valuable information,
but quite often it is hidden under vast amounts of
unstructured user generated input. In this section,
we propose a set of methods that build on one an-
other, which aim to filter the non desirable noise
and extract the most informative features not only
based on word frequencies, but also by incorporat-
ing users in this process.
3.1 The bilinear model
There exist a number of different possibilities for
incorporating user information into a regression
model. A simple approach is to expand the fea-
ture set, such that each user?s effect on the re-
sponse variable can be modelled separately. Al-
though flexible, this approach would be doomed
to failure due to the sheer size of the resulting fea-
ture set, and the propensity to overfit all but the
largest of training sets. One solution is to group
users into different types, such as journalist, politi-
cian, activist, etc., but this presupposes a method
for classification or clustering of users which is a
non-trivial undertaking. Besides, these na??ve ap-
proaches fail to account for the fact that most users
use similar words to express their opinions, by
separately parameterising the model for different
users or user groups.
We propose to account for individual users
while restricting all users to share the same vocab-
ulary. This is formulated as a bilinear predictive
model,
f(X) = uTXw + ? , (1)
where X is an m ? p matrix of user-word fre-
quencies and u and w are the model parameters.
Let Q ? Rn?m?p be a tensor which captures our
training inputs, where n, m and p denote the con-
sidered number of samples (each sample usually
refers to a day), terms and users respectively; Q
can simply be interpreted as n versions of X (de-
noted by Qi in the remainder of the script), a dif-
ferent one for each day, put together. Each element
3This has been carried out to ensure an adequate number
of training points in the experimental process.
Qijk holds the frequency of term j for user k dur-
ing the day i in our sample. If a user k has posted
ci?k tweets during day i, and cijk ? ci?k of them
contain a term j, then the frequency of j for this
day and user is defined as Qijk = cijkci?k .Aiming to learn sparse sets of users and terms
that are representative of the voting intention sig-
nal, we formulate our optimisation task as follows:
{w?,u?, ??} = argmin
w,u,?
n?
i=1
(
uTQiw + ? ? yi
)2
+ ?(w, ?1) + ?(u, ?2) ,
(2)
where y ? Rn is the response variable (voting in-
tention), w ? Rm and u ? Rp denote the term
and user weights respectively, uTQiw expresses
the bilinear term, ? ? R is a bias term and ?(?)
is a regularisation function with parameters ?1 or
?2. The first term in Eq. 2 is the standard regulari-
sation loss function, namely the sum squared error
over the training instances.4
In the main formulation of our bilinear model,
as the regularisation function ?(?) we use the elas-
tic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), an extension of
the well-studied `1-norm regulariser, known as the
LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996). The `1-norm regu-
larisation has found many applications in several
scientific fields as it encourages sparse solutions
which reduce the possibility of overfitting and en-
hance the interpretability of the inferred model
(Hastie et al, 2009). The elastic net applies an
extra penalty on the `2-norm of the weight vector,
and can resolve instability issues of LASSO which
arise when correlated predictors exist in the input
data (Zhao and Yu, 2006). Its regularisation func-
tion ?el(?) is defined by:
?el (w, ?, ?) = ?
(1? ?
2 ?w?
2
2 + ??w?1
)
, (3)
where ? > 0 and ? ? [0, 1); setting parameter
? to its extremes transforms elastic net to ridge
regression (? = 0) or vanilla LASSO (? = 1).
Eq. 2 can be treated as a biconvex learning task
(Al-Khayyal and Falk, 1983), by observing that
for a fixed w, learning u is a convex problem and
vice versa. Biconvex functions and possible ap-
plications have been well studied in the optimi-
sation literature (Quesada and Grossmann, 1995;
4Note that other loss functions could be used here, such
as logistic loss for classification, or more generally bilinear
variations of Generalised Linear Models (Nelder and Wed-
derburn, 1972).
995
Pirsiavash et al, 2009). Their main advantage is
the ability to solve efficiently non-convex prob-
lems by a repeated application of two convex pro-
cesses, i.e., a form of coordinate ascent. In our
case, the bilinear technique makes it possible to
explore both word and user spaces, while main-
taining a modest training complexity.
Therefore, in our bilinear approach we divide
learning in two phases, where we learn word and
user weights respectively. For the first phase we
produce the term-scores matrix V ? Rn?m with
elements given by:
Vij =
p?
z=1
uzQijz. (4)
V contains weighted sums of term frequencies
over all users for the considered set of days. The
weights are held in u and are representative of
each user. The initial optimisation task is formu-
lated as:
{w?, ??} = argmin
w,?
?Vw + ? ? y?22
+ ?el (w, ?1, ?1) ,
(5)
where we aim to learn a sparse but consistent set
of weights w? for the terms of our vocabulary.
In the second phase, we are using w? to form
the user-scores matrix D ? Rn?p:
Dik =
m?
z=1
w?zQizk , (6)
which now contains weighted sums over all terms
for the same set of days. The optimisation task
becomes:
{u?, ??} = argmin
u,?
?Du + ? ? y?22
+ ?el (u, ?2, ?2) .
(7)
This process continues iteratively by inserting
the weights of the second phase back to phase one,
and so on until convergence. We cannot claim that
a global optimum will be reached, but biconvexity
guarantees that our global objective (Eq. 2) will
decrease in each step of this iterative process. In
the remainder of this paper, we refer to the method
described above as Bilinear Elastic Net (BEN).
3.2 Exploiting term-target or user-target
relationships
The previous model assumes that the response
variable y holds information about a single infer-
ence target. However, the task that we are ad-
dressing in this paper usually implies the exis-
tence of several targets, i.e., different political par-
ties or politicians. An important property, there-
fore, is the ability to perform multiple output re-
gression. A simple way of adapting the model to
the multiple output scenario is by framing a sep-
arate learning problem for each output, but tying
together some of the parameters. Here we con-
sider tying together the user weights u, to enforce
that the same set of users are relevant to all tasks,
while learning different term weights. Note that
the converse situation, where w?s are tied and u?s
are independent, can be formulated in an equiva-
lent manner.
Suppose that our target variable y ? R?n refers
now to ? political entities, y = [yT1yT2 ...yT?
]T; in
this formation the top n elements of y match to
the first political entity, the next n elements to the
second and so on. In the first phase of the bilin-
ear model, we would have to solve the following
optimisation task:
{w?, ??} = argmin
w,?
??
i=1
?Vwi + ?i ? yi?22
+
??
i=1
?el (wi, ?1, ?1) ,
(8)
where V is given by Eq. 4 and w? ? R?m de-
notes the vector of weights which can be sliced
into ? sub-vectors {w?1, ...,w??} each one repre-
senting a political entity. In the second phase,
sub-vectorsw?i are used to form the input matrices
Di, i ? {1, ..., ?} with elements given by Eq. 6.
The input matrix D? is formed by the vertical
concatenation of all Di user score matrices, i.e.,
D? =
[
DT1 ... DT?
]T, and the optimisation target is
equivalent to the one expressed in Eq. 7. Since
D? ? R?n?p, the user weight vector u? ? Rp and
thus, we are learning a single weight per user and
not one per political party as in the previous step.
The method described above allows learning
different term weights per response variable and
then binds them under a shared set of user weights.
As mentioned before, one could also try the oppo-
site (i.e., start by expanding the user space); both
those models can also be optimised in an itera-
tive process. However, our experiments revealed
that those approaches did not improve on the
performance of BEN. Still, this behaviour could
be problem-specific, i.e., learning different words
996
from a shared set of users (and the opposite) may
not be a good modelling practice for the domain of
politics. Nevertheless, this observation served as
a motivation for the method described in the next
section, where we extract a consistent set of words
and users that are weighted differently among the
considered political entities.
3.3 Multi-task learning with the `1/`2
regulariser
All previous models ? even when combining all
inference targets ? were not able to explore rela-
tionships across the different task domains; in our
case, a task domain is defined by a specific politi-
cal label or party. Ideally, we would like to make a
sparse selection of words and users but with a reg-
ulariser that promotes inter-task sharing of struc-
ture, so that many features may have a positive
influence towards one or more parties, but nega-
tive towards the remaining one(s). It is possible to
achieve this multi-task learning property by intro-
ducing a different set of regularisation constraints
in the optimisation function.
We perform multi-task learning using an exten-
sion of group LASSO (Yuan and Lin, 2006), a
method known as `1 /` 2 regularisation (Argyriou et
al., 2008; Liu et al, 2009). Group LASSO exploits
a predefined group structure on the feature space
and tries to achieve sparsity in the group-level, i.e.,
it does not perform feature selection (unlike the
elastic net), but group selection. The `1/`2 regu-
lariser extends this notion for a ? -dimensional re-
sponse variable. The global optimisation target is
now formulated as:
{W ?, U?,??} =
argmin
W,U,?
??
t=1
n?
i=1
(
uTtQiwt + ?t ? yti
)2
+ ?1
m?
j=1
?Wj?2 + ?2
p?
k=1
?Uk?2,
(9)
where the input matrix Qi is defined in the same
way as earlier, W = [w1 ... w? ] is the term weight
matrix (each wt refers to the t-th political entity
or task), equivalently U = [u1 ... u? ], Wj and Uj
denote the j-th rows of weight matrices W and
U respectively, and vector ? ? R? holds the bias
terms per task. In this optimisation process, we
aim to enforce sparsity in the feature space but in
a structured manner. Notice that we are now regu-
larising the `2,1 mixed norm ofW and U , which is
defined as the sum of the row `2-norms for those
matrices. As a result, we expect to encourage the
activation of a sparse set of features (correspond-
ing to the rows of W and U ), but with nonzero
weights across the ? tasks (Argyriou et al, 2008).
Consequently, we are performing filtering (many
users and words will have zero weights) and, at the
same time, assign weights of different magnitude
and sign on the selected features, something that
suits a political opinion mining application, where
pro-A often means anti-B.
Eq. 9 can be broken into two convex tasks (fol-
lowing the same notion as in Eqs. 5 and 7), where
we individually learn {W,?} and then {U,?};
each step of the process is a standard linear regres-
sion problem with an `1/`2 regulariser. Again, we
are able iterate this bilinear process and in each
step convexity is guaranteed. We refer to this
method as Bilinear Group `1/`2 (BGL).
4 Experiments
The proposed models are evaluated on Cuk and
Cau which have been introduced in Section 2. We
measure predictive performance, compare it to the
performance of several competitive baselines, and
provide a qualitative analysis of the parameters
learned by the models.
4.1 Data preprocessing
Basic preprocessing has been applied on the vo-
cabulary index of Cuk and Cau aiming to filter out
some of the word features and partially reduce
the dimensionality of the problem. Stop words
and web links were removed in both sets, together
with character sequences of length <4 and <3
for Cuk and Cau respectively.5 As the vocabulary
size of Cuk was significantly larger, for this data
set we have additionally merged Twitter hashtags
(i.e., words starting with ?#?) with their exact non
topic word match, where possible (by dropping the
?#? when the word existed in the index). After
performing the preprocessing routines described
above, the vocabulary sizes for Cuk and Cau were
set to 80,976 and 22,917 respectively.
4.2 Predictive accuracy
To evaluate the predictive accuracy of our meth-
ods, we have chosen to emulate a real-life scenario
5Most of the times those character sequences were not
valid words. This pattern was different in each language and
thus, a different filtering threshold was applied in each data
set.

of voting intention prediction. The evaluation pro-
cess starts by using a fixed set of polls matching
to consecutive time points in the past for training
and validating the parameters of each model. Test-
ing is performed on the following ? (unseen) polls
of the data set. In the next step of the evaluation
process, the training/validation set is increased by
merging it with the previously used test set (?
polls), and testing is now performed on the next
? unseen polls. In our experiments, the number of
steps in this evaluation process is set to 10 and in
each step the size of the test set is set to ? = 5
polls. Hence, each model is tested on 50 unseen
and consecutive in time samples. The loss func-
tion in our evaluation is the standard Mean Square
Error (MSE), but to allow a better interpretation
of the results, we display its root (RMSE) in ta-
bles and figures.6
The parameters of each model (?i for BEN and
?i for BEN and BGL, i ? {1, 2}) are optimised
using a held-out validation set by performing grid
search. Note that it may be tempting to adapt the
regularisation parameters in each phase of the it-
erative training loop, however this would change
the global objective (see Eqs. 2 and 9) and thus
convergence will not be guaranteed. A key ques-
tion is how many iterations of training are required
to reach convergence. Figure 2 illustrates how the
BEN global objective function (Eq. 2) converges
during this iterative process and the model?s per-
formance on an unseen validation set. Notice that
there is a large performance improvement after the
first step (which alone is a linear solver), but over-
fitting occurs after step 11. Based on this result,
for subsequent experiments we run the training
process for two iterations (4 steps), and take the

set.
We compare the performance of our methods
with three baselines. The first makes a constant
prediction of the mean value of the response vari-
able y in the training set (B?); the second predicts
the last value of y (Blast); and the third baseline
(LEN) is a linear regression over the terms using
elastic net regularisation. Recalling that each test
set is made of 5 polls, Blast should be considered
as a hard baseline to beat7 given that voting inten-
tions tend to have a smooth behaviour. Moreover,
improving on LEN partly justifies the usefulness
of a bilinear approach compared to a linear one.
Performance results comparing inferred voting
intention percentages and polls for Cuk and Cau are
presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. For the
UK case study, both BEN and BGL are able to beat
all baselines in average performance across all par-
ties. However in the Austrian case study, LEN
performs better that BEN, something that could be
justified by the fact that the users in Cau were se-
lected by domain experts, and consequently there
was not much gain to be had by filtering them fur-
ther. Nevertheless, the difference in performance
was rather small (approx. 0.26% error) and the in-

ture in the model, and would likely improve predictive perfor-
mance.

observe that BEN (Fig. 3b) cannot register any

Table 3: Examples of tweets amongst the ones with top positive and negative scores per party for both
Cuk and Cau data sets (tweets in Austrian have been translated in English as well). Notice that weight
magnitude may differ per case study and party as they are based on the range of the response variable
and the total number of selected features.
general observation is that BEN?s predictions are
smooth and do not vary significantly with time.
This might be a result of overfitting the model
to a single response variable which usually has
a smooth behaviour. On the contrary, the multi-
task learning property of BGL reduces this type of
overfitting providing more statistical evidence for
the terms and users and thus, yielding not only a
better inference performance, but also a more ac-
curate model.
4.3 Qualitative Analysis
In this section, we refer to features that have been
selected and weighted as significant by our bi-
linear learning functions. Based on the weights
for the word and the user spaces that we re-
trieve after the application of BGL in the last step
of the evaluation process (see the previous sec-
tion), we compute a score (weighted sum) for each
tweet in our training data sets for both Cuk and
Cau. Table 3 shows examples of interesting tweets
amongst the top weighted ones (positively as well
as negatively) per party. Together with their text
(anonymised for privacy reasons) and scores, we
also provide an attribute for the author (if present).
In the displayed tweets for the UK study, the only
possible outlier is the ?Art Fanzine?; still, it seems
to register a consistent behaviour (positive towards
1000
LAB, negative towards LBD) and, of course, hid-
den, indirect relationships may exist between po-
litical opinion and art. The Austrian case study
revealed even more interesting tweets since train-
ing was conducted on data from a very active pre-
election period (we made an effort to translate
those tweets in English language as well). For
a better interpretation of the presented tweets, it
may be useful to know that ?Johannes Voggen-
huber? (who receives a positive comment for his
book) and ?Peter Pilz? (whose comment is ques-
tioned) are members of GRU?, ?Krone? (or Kro-
nen Zeitung) is the major newspaper in Austria10
and that FPO? is labelled as a far right party, some-
thing that may cause various reactions from ?Hu-
man Rights? organisations.
5 Related Work
The topic of political opinion mining from So-
cial Media has been the focus of various recent
research works. Several papers have presented
methods that aim to predict the result of an elec-
tion (Tumasjan et al, 2010; Bermingham and
Smeaton, 2011) or to model voting intention and
other kinds of socio-political polls (O?Connor et
al., 2010; Lampos, 2012). Their common fea-
ture is a methodology based on a meta-analysis
of word frequencies using off-the-shelf sentiment
tools such as LIWC (Pennebaker et al, 2007)
or Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).
Moreover, the proposed techniques tend to incor-
porate posting volume figures as well as hand-
crafted lists of words relevant to the task (e.g.,
names of politicians or parties) in order to filter
the content successfully.
Such papers have been criticised as their meth-
ods do not generalise when applied on different
data sets. According to the work in (Gayo-Avello
et al, 2011), the methods presented in (Tumasjan
et al, 2010) and (O?Connor et al, 2010) failed to
predict the result of US congressional elections in
2009. We disagree with the arguments support-
ing the statement ?you cannot predict elections
with Twitter? (Gayo-Avello, 2012), as many times
in the past actual voting intention polls have also
failed to predict election outcomes, but we agree
that most methods that have been proposed so far
were not entirely generic. It is a fact that the
10?Accused of abusing its near monopoly to manipulate
public opinion in Austria?, Wikipedia, 19/02/2013, http:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronen_Zeitung.
majority of sentiment analysis tools are English-
specific (or even American English) and, most
importantly, political word lists (or ontologies)
change in time, per country and per party; hence,
generalisable methods should make an effort to
limit reliance from such tools.
Furthermore, our work ? indirectly ? meets the
guidelines proposed in (Metaxas et al, 2011) as
we have developed a framework of ?well-defined?
algorithms that are ?Social Web aware? (since the
bilinear approach aims to improve noise filtering)
and that have been tested on two evaluation sce-
narios with distinct characteristics.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We have presented a novel method for text regres-
sion that exploits both word and user spaces by
solving a bilinear optimisation task, and an ex-
tension that applies multi-task learning for multi-
output inference. Our approach performs feature
selection ? hence, noise filtering ? on large-scale
user-generated inputs automatically, generalises
across two languages without manual adaptations
and delivers some significant improvements over
strong performance baselines (< 1.5% error when
predicting polls). The application domain in this
paper was politics, though the presented methods
are generic and could be easily applied on various
other domains, such as health or finance.
Future work may investigate further modelling
improvements achieved by applying different reg-
ularisation functions as well as the adaptation of
the presented models to classification problems.
Finally, in the application level, we aim at an in-
depth analysis of patterns and characteristics in the
extracted sets of features by collaborating with do-
main experts (e.g., political analysts).
