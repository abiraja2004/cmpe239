Sentences a, ith crossing coreference (Bach-Peters-sentences) are notoriously 
difficult to eq/lain ill a natural nmnner. An intriguing parallel with certain pro- 
perties of t 'mlog suggests a modificatiml to Discour~ Represenlation Thexn'y 
which allows a simple and coherent explanation of these, and related, sentences. 
The  Probte ln  
In English there is due type of sentence that has caused major problems for prac- 
tically all linguistic theories that have tried to explain it, and none of Ihe explana- 
tions put forward is very convincing. The sentences in question are those with 
cross'lag corcferenee, the so-called Bach-Peters-sentences. The standard exam- 
pies arc: 
l) "The htutter who shot  al:, i t  hJl; the  \ ] ion  that  chased  h im 
and, with cxpiicit quarldfier expressions: 
2) Every  man who wants  it w i l l  get  the  pr i ze  he deserves  
What is the difficulty wilh this type of sentence? 'Illey contaiu two uoun phrases 
each of which contains a pronoun that refers to the other notnl phrase, and tile 
first pronoun is filrthermore a case of "backwards anaphora", or "cataphonl". 
These sentences are admittedly tare, bet sentences with simple (non-crossing) 
camphora re quite frequent ill real world English (Carden 1982). And Bach- 
Peters-sentences are nevertheless perlectly reguhu', and so they should find a 
natural exph/nation. Moreover, they are key exanlplcs of sentences where Gala. 
pllora cannot, in principle, be mphlced by anaphora (cf. also Mittwoch 1983). 
This is imporlant because one of tile standard approaches to cataphora has been 
to define it away as stylistic variant of anaphm'a, which can be "rectified" by a 
simple transposition. Ill other words: Since we have to find a way to explain cata- 
phora for Bach-F'eters-sentences anyway, we carl save us the lfouble to devise 
such tricks for the siutpler cases. 
Are  Bach-Peters -P ronouns  Descr ip t iona l  l ' ronouns?  
The non-reAucibility of cataphofic to anaphoric pronouns in Bach-Peters- 
sentences becomes clear if we try to explain them in tile traditional manaer. It 
seems that both of/t ie two traditional interpretations of prononns, tile "de~:rip- 
tional" as well as the "denotafionar' one, fail to explain the intuitive truth condi- 
lions of Baeh-l'ete~.-sentences. In Transformational Grammar the deseriptional 
approach is taken, trod pronouns are always expanded to the sl,rface syntax form 
of the norm pbaase they anaphoric~dly refer to (in other words, pronominalization 
is an obligalxlry cyclic rule). But then we get, for tile example above, a double 
infinite embedding of relative clauses: 
The hunter  who shot  at  
(the l ion  that  chased  
(the hunter  who shot  at  
(tile l i on  that  chased  . . . ) ) ) 
h i t  the  l i on  that  chased  
(the hunter  who shot  at  
(the l i on  that  ohased  
(the hunter  who shot  at  ... ))) 
This analysis is patently uselc,ss. K,'u'ttuuen shows (Karttunen 1971) that drop- 
ping the requirement that pronominalization is a cyclic rule alleviates the prob- 
lem somewhat, but at a cost: II would make sentence 1derivable from (at least) 
two different deep structures, viz. fi'om file deep structures corresponding to the 
sentences 
3) Tile hunt;~r who shot  at  the  ll.on that  chased him h i t  it: 
d) The  lJ.on thai: chased  the  hlnlter who shot  at it was  hit 
by  h im 
This would mean that 1 has to he mnbiguous between the meanings of 3 and 4. 
This is what Karttuncn assumes, but it is a highly duhious claim as Karttunen 
himself scculs to fcel (Karttunen 1971:167 i t .  Moreover, the strnctum of I co,ld 
also be derived from a deep stractm'e corresponding to 
5) The  hunter  who shot  at  the  l~on h i t  the  l ion  that  chased  
tile hunter  
But Oils sentence is considered by nuuly informants to l~e simply ungramnmtical 
(Karttunen 1971:178), aud ill is not acceptable at all under the corefblvnce rela- 
tions that should obtain between tile noun phrases. Finally, the assonlption that l 
is three ways ambiguo,s bctwceu 3, 4 and 5 is unaccellml~le, too, Ill urder to 
show this, and in order to underslanll better what these three sentences really 
nlean, we Call USe a set of data hascs (after Karttnaen 1971) which eitller contain, 
or do not contain, well-definexl referents for the varimm defiaite uoun phrases 
occtnriag iu/lie example sentences. We will see that I is not alnhiguous hclwccn 
3 anti 4, \[lilt that the three sentences have three distinct n/eanings which Call lie 
derived directly fl'onl their syniactic stractllre. This proves, at tile same time, lha! 
cataphoric prououns are irreducible ill Bach-Peters-sentences. Let us first con- 
sider tile dcfiuite nonu phrase "the hunlor who shot at tile lion dmt chased him" 
(fiont 3) consisting of an embedding of two definite noun phrases. Since each 
singular definite noun phrase presupposes that there is a nnique retereut for it, 
this phrase cau refer to a pah" "hnnter H - lion I/' in the case whom lion L is the 
only lion chasing huuter tl, and this hanter H shot at this very lion L. Ill the fol 
lowing dam base (Karttunen 1971:166) there is one such pair. 
hun to  r (hl) . chased  ( L 1 ~ h3  ) . \ ] ion  ( ~ t ) . 
hunter  (h2) . chased  (12, h \] ) . \] J on  ( \]2 ) . 
hunter  (h3) . chased  (13,112) . l i on  {13) . 
shot ;  _at (hl ,  i l l  . shot_at  (h2, \] 1 ) . shot  a t  (h2, \] 3 ) . 
shotat  (hl,  13)  . shot; a t  (h3r \ ]3)  . shotat  (h3, 12) . 
\]?;or each hnnter, there is a single lion chasinj~ him but only elm hunter ~dso 
shoots at this lion, viz. hnnter 2 who shoots at lion 3. I{unter 2 S}IOOIS at Oilier 
lions, as well (e.g. at lion 1) but lieu I doesn't chase hunter 2 (although it does 
chase other hunters, e.g. hnnlm" 3). Hence it can be said (Dik 1973:320) that tile 
delinite uonn phrase "the hnnter who shot at tile lion that chased hiuf' has a 
well-defined referent in ally data hase which contaius fl~st one contigllration of 
the type 
shoots ?'~ "-" 7-~'?"  
~t , . .  hunter 4 . . . . .  ~ lion ~ 
6) chases ~ . ~  
This rules out that other lions chase the hunter, bat it leaves open tile possibility 
that the hunter shoots at other lions, that the lien chases other hunters aml, in par- 
ticular, that other hunters hoot at the lion. On the other hand, example 4, "The 
lion/lint chasexl tile bunter who shot at it was hit by him", is not intelllretnble in
the data base given above, lts subject, "the lion that chased the hnnter who shot 
at it", Nils to refer properly: There is only one lkm for which/llere is a huater we 
can call "the hunter who shot at it", viz. lion 2 (the other two lions are both being 
shot at by nlm'e than one hunter), but lion 2 does not chase "die hmlter who shot 
at it" (viz. hunter 3), and so tile enfile noan phrase fails to refer. A data base 
where there is a referent for this noun phrase couhl look like that: 
hunter  (hl) . chased  Ill., h l )  . l l on  l i l t  . 
hunter  (h2) . chased  ( 13., h3  ) . \] i on  (12) . 
hunter  (h3) . chased(12 ,h l )  . l i on  (13) . 
shot_at  (hl ,  \].2) . chased  (\],2, h3)  . chased  (\].3, h2)  . 
shot_at  (h2, i i )  . shot .  a t  (h3, 13) . chased(13 ,  h l )  . 
The definite nouu phrase "trio lion that chased the hanter who shot at it" has a 
well-defined refereat ill troy data base which contains just one configuration of 
tile type 7: ,, o . .~ .  ..~ ? ,, ? 
7) hunter  ~ lion 
? . .  ~- - "~"  ,A  
Exmnple 1 cannot be inter0reted in either ttle first or/lm second data base. It is 
interpretable only in a dam base which contains at most one confignratkm like 8 
which combines restrictions 6 and 7:

Are Bach.Peters-Pronouns "Bound Variable" Pronouns? 
Since the unmodified as well as the modified escriptional interpretations of pro- 
nouns in Bach-Peters-sentences do not allow us to represent these distinctions 
they cannot be accepted. But how do the "deep" approaches topronouns, the so- 
called "denotational" interpretations, fare? 
The prototypical denotational interpretation f pronoans is the one suggested by 
Fh'st Order \[x)gic, where bound variables ate seen as the logical counterpart of
pronouns in Natural Language. If we use iota-operators, wecould try to translate 
I into 
9) h i t ( io ta  Z: \[hunter(Z) ^ shot_at (Z,W)\ ] ,  
iota W: \[lion(W) ^ chasedlW, Z)\]) 
The trouble is that iota-operators bind their variables, making them inaccessible 
for reference from the outside. Hence we cannot refer forward from the term 
"shot at(Z,W)" to the "W" in the second iota-expression, nor can we refer back- 
ward from "chased(W,Z)" tothe "Z" in the first iota-expression. If we add equal- 
ity to First Order Logic there is a way out. We could re-phrase 9 as 
10) H x: H Y: (hit(x,Y) A 
X=iota  Z: 
Y=iota  W: 
\[hunter(Z) A shot at(Z,Y)\]  A 
\[lion(W) ^ chased(W,X) \] ) 
The other examples, 3 and 4, woul d then become 
11) 3 x: ~ Y: (hit(X,Y) ^ 
X= iota Z: \[hunter(Zl ^ 
shot a t (Z , io ta  W: \[lion(W) A chasedlW, Z)\])\] ^ 
Y= iota V: \ [ l ion(V l ^ chased(V,X) \ ] l  
12) 3 X: -q Y: (hit (X,Y) A 
X = iota Z: \[hnnter(Z) ^ shot_at(Z,Y) \ ]  A 
Y= iota W: \[lion(W) A 
chased(W, iota V: \[hunter(V) ^ shot_at (V ,W)\ ] ) \ ] )  
But in cases 11 and 12 part of the expression must be repeated, namely the one 
stating the uniqueness of the hnnter-chasing lion, and of the lion-shooting bunter, 
respectively. This is a very unattractive way to express this sort of thing, and 
Karttauen agrees: "One is tempted to think that one of \[these repeated efinite 
descriptions\] could be eliminated by a more clever use of variables, especially 
when variables in predicate calculus are generaUy used very much the same way 
as pronouns in natural language. \[_.\] \[But\] the second appearance of the same 
description cannot be avoided, because, in predicate calculus, there is no way to 
refer back to the first." (Karttunen 1971:176). 
McCawley's suggestion: Referential indices 
But this is the point where other people disagree. McCawley (McCawley 19"10), 
for instance, argues (for other easons), that the semantic representation f sen- 
tences hould not be east in terms of First Order Logic, but rather in terms of the 
overall proposition of a sentence plus referential indices. The proposition would 
define the relationship that exists between the different objects talked about in 
the sentence, but these objects would be represented independently b referential 
indices that correspond to the "intended reference" of the noun phrase. These 
indices are "identified" by the noun phrases in the sentence, i.e. their values are 
determined by the nonn phrases. A sentence such as "The man killed the 
woman", would be translated as 
13) s ( 
proposition(killed(Xl,X2)}, 
np(Xl:  the  man) 
nplX2: the woman)) 
A surface sentence would be generated from this structure by replacing die 
referential indices in the proposition by the noun phrases identifying them. As 
for Bach-Peters-sentences, example 1would be represented as
14) s I 
propos i t ion(h i t (X l ,X2) ) ,  
np(Xl:  the hunter  who shot at X2) 
np(XZ: the l ion that chased Xl)) 
Here the referential indices are identified by noun phrases which themselves con- 
rain referential indices. \]f we want Ix\] generate a surface senteuee from this struc- 
ture we will have to ~'eplaee the referential indices by their identifying nmm 
phrases, but we will not be able to replace systematically all referential indices 
this way, because fltis would lead tit the same kind of infinite embedding that we 
encountered above. We will rather, at some point in the derivation, have to tncn 
some of the refereoti~d indices into pronouns (talOns into account case, gender 
and number). The point at which we stop replacing referential indices by full 
noun phrases and start turning them into pronouns will determine which of 
several possible paraphrases of a sentence we will obtain. The distinction 
between "proposition" on the one hand and "referential index" with the accom- 
panying "identifying noun phrase" on the other hand allows McCawley to over- 
come the problem with repeated components: The "identifying noun phrase" of a 
referential index is memioned only once, independently of how many times the 
referential index itself is used elsewhere in the representation. 
D ik ' s  Mod i f i ca t io~ o f  McCawle /s  Theory  
This approach as been criticized on different coums. First, it is not clear at 
which point referential indices may begin to he tarued into l)mnouns rather than 
being replaeexl by identifying expressions. Second, and more importantly, 
McCawley's uggestion allows all three sentences (1, 3, and 4) to be derived 
from the same semantic representation, which would require that they are all 
synonymous. Hence all the problems we encountereA with the descriptional 
interpretation f pronouns are hack with a vengeance. Does that meau that we 
have to return to the standmd First Order Logic representation with all its 
unattractive features (repetition of components)? Dik 1973 suggests a 
mothfication of McCawley's approach that takes care of the empirical fact that 
file three sentences mentioned above are not synonynrous. 
The main syntactic diffel~nce between the three example sentence,; is the way in 
which tfie different full noun pllrases are embedded in each other. In particular, 
in the Bach-Peters-sentence there are no embedded full noun phrases; tile only 
embedded noun phrases are pronouns ("who shot at it", "that chased him"). This 
kind of distinction is lost in McCawley's original notation, which is the reason 
why he has to ch'fim that the examples sentences axe all synonymous. Dik's first 
(and main) modification of McCawley's notation makes sm'e that this, cnlcial, 
distioction is not lost. The way to achieve this goal is by iuiroduciug what might 
be called (not Dik's expression) "annotated variables" to take the place of 
McCawley's referential indices, which are constants. The annotation of a vari- 
able indicates how tile value of the variable is to be computed. Thus 
"X2(X2=iota Z: (lion(Z) ^  chased(Z,Y)))" is an annotated vari~thle. This would 
give as, for 3, 
15) hit (XI,X2) 
X l= io ta  Y: (hunter (Y) A 
~hot at(Y, X2(XZ=iota Z: (\].ion(Z) A chased(Z,Y) ) ) ) )  
As in McCawley's system, refereotial indices umst be replaced by the 
corresponding identifying expressions, and any variables remaining after this 
step are tnmed into pronouns. In addition, we have the usual convention that 
functional expressions are to be evaluated from the inside out. But what is gained 
by faithfuUy copying a certain syntactic structure (viz. embedding) into the deep 
representation? Are the interpretation rules given by Dik really sufficient to inter- 
pret the resulting expressions correctly? If we perform the replacement, lbr 
instance, in 15 we get 
16) h i t ( io ta  Y: (hunter(Y) A 
shot a t (Y ,X2 lX2=iota  Z: (lion(Z) A chased(Z ,Y ) ) ) ) l ,X2)  
Now, if we wanted to generate a surface sentence from tiffs representation we 
would turn the remaining unbound varinble, i.e. "X2", into a pronoun, and every- 
thing would be in order. But what if we wmtted In evaluate this statement over 
one of the data bases? The X2 on the level of the proposition, i.e. "hit(...,X2)" is 
clearly outside the scope of the "almotntion" defining its value, and so we would 
expect it to remain unbound alter the annotation itself has been evaluated. This 
is, after 'all, precisely the reason why Karttunen thought it necessary to re- 
introduce the duplication of logical expressions that McCawley had tried to gel 
rid of: To provide the second, outer, occurrence of this variable with a value. We 
need an interpretation rule which specifies how variables of this kind can be 
bound, and this rule is not provided by Dik.

An Unexpectedly Simple Solution Suggested by Second- 
Order Pro log  Const ructs  
As it turns out, the additional interpretation rule that makes the correct interpreta- 
tion of Bach-Peters-sentences virtually "fall out" is the definition of second-order 
operators, and the general interpretation rules of Horn Clause Logic, as imple- 
mented in starutard Prolog: Instead of "Z=iota X: (Y)" we use "setof(X,Y,\[Z\])", 
where the nniqueness reqltirement is built into the definition of "setof', and 
singularity is enforced by requiring the result list to consist of exactly one ele- 
ment. Annotated variables on the other hand are "multiplied out" in the relational 
spirit of Prolog, i.e. instead of "predicate(X,Y(Y=Z))" we write 
"(predieate(X,Y), Y=Z)". Combining these two steps we get, for the expression 
above, 
17) hit(Xl,X2), 
seto f (Y ,  (hunter  (Y) , 
se to f (Z ,  ( l ion(Z) ,  chased(Z ,Y ) ) ,  \ [X2\]) ,  
shotat  (Y, X2) ) , \[Xl \] ) 
or, with a more suggestive choice of variable names and a more efficient ordering 
of the goals 
Ig) se to f (H ,  (hunter(It) , shotat  (H,TL) , 
se to f  (L, ( l ion (L) , chased(L ,  TH) ) , \[TL\] ) ) , \[TH\] ) , 
h i t  (TH,TL) . 
Now the desireal truth conditions come out corrccdy. We can see this if we treat 
18 as a Prolog query: We lind, first, a lmnter CH") who shoots at something 
CTL"). Then we check whether this entity is identical with the set of exactly one 
lion C\['IL\]") ttmt chases omeone CTH") who mast then tam out to be identical 
with the hunter who is the only such hunter C\[TH\]"). Finally we check whether 
this hunter also hits this lion. The other sentences are represented the same way: 
4 and 1 (the Bach-Peters-sentence) give
19) seto f  (L, ( l ion (L) , uhased(L ,  Tn) , 
se to f  (H, (hunter  (H) , shotat  (H, TL) ) , \[TH\] ) ) , \[TL\] ) , 
h i t  (TH, TL) . 
20) se to f  (n, (hunter  (H) , shot  at  (H, TL) ) , \[TH\] ) , 
se to f  (L, ( l ion (L) , chased  (L, TH) ) , \[TL\] ) , 
h i t  (TH,T6) . 
Now we get, without any additional stipulations, the three different interpreta- 
tions for the tlnee example sentences. The sentences are neither collapsed into 
one single meaning repre~ntation (with three synonymous surface sentences), as
with McCawley's approach, nor into two different ones (with two distinct and 
unambiguous, :rod one ambiguous, surface sentence), as with IGarttanen's 
approach. The simple fact that in Bach-Peters-sentences th  full definite descrip- 
tions are not embedded, forces them to evaluate to two distinct, independently 
unique, values, and this ensures that these sentences are true only over data bases 
meeting condititm 8. 
But how can this unexpectedly straightforward solution be explained? The main 
problem that McCawley's representation, and Dik's modification of it, tried to 
overcome was: How can variable values be communicated into iota-expressions 
from the outside, despite the fact that, in First Order Logic, variables within the 
scope of an operator or quantifier are shielded from the outside? Now, in Horn 
Clause Logic nil variables of a clause are, implicitly, universally quantified 
(which means that variables in a query, i.e. in a negated clause, are existentially 
quantified), and the scope of the implicit quantifiers is the entire clause. The 
bindings of variables "spread" tlvoughout the clause, irrespective of how deep a 
variable may be. embedded. This also applies to the setof-operator: All its vari- 
ables are accessible from the outside, within the given clause. The variables can, 
of course, still be unbound when the evaluation of the setof-expression begins, 
and then it is the evaluation of the setof-expression that will establish bindings 
for these variables. But they can also get bound elsewhere, before the operator is
used, and "spr~td forward". And then a proof of tim setof-expression treats these 
pre-established I~indings as constraints to be satisfied. This is the Prolog way to 
implement the cataphoric pronoun in Bach-Peters-sentences, In this, last, respect 
the setofoperator in Prolog is treated as just another predicate, and its being 
second order is irrelevant. The difference is that the interpretation of the setof- 
operator uses Prolog's meta-callfacility. Or, to put it differently: A piece of code 
(the entries in the second argument of the semf-operator) isfirst treated as "data" 
(variable bindings are communicated with the outside world), and then it is 
treated as a piece of "program" that is executed (using the variable bindings that 
are established atthis point in time). And in this the Prolog setof-operator differs 
fundamentally form the iota-operator as used in First Order Logic. The iota- 
operator has, a~ fro" as variable binding is concerned, the same force as a 
quantifier: A variable in its scope is immune from any outside interference. 
Now it is clear why we need not repeat any expressions in the representation f 
the example sentences, and yet the variables all get properly bound: In the exam- 
ple above, the two terms of 18 (i.e. rite setof-expression a d the expression 
"hit(TH,TL)") are part of the same clause, and values for variables created in 
either of them will spread to the other. In particular, the value which the variable 
"TL" takes during the evaluation of "shot_at(H,TL)" is still available during the 
evaluation of the embedded "setof(L,(lion(L),chased(L,TH)),\[TL\])", and later 
during the evaluation of "hit(TH,TL)". 
Mapping Variables onto Pronouns 
If we want to generate surface sentences from these stmctares, we must distin- 
guish between two uses of variables: First there are those uses which are merely 
an artefact of the relational way of representing functional application, and, 
second, there are those that correspond to true anaphoric relations in language. 
The first use is simple: If we want o represent functional applications such as 
plus(times(3,2),4) 
in a relational language, we must "multiply out" the embedded expression and 
create auxiliary variables for the intermediate r sults, e.g. "X" and "Y" in 
times(3,2,X), plus(X,4,Y) 
Thus we had to use 20, with auxiliary variables "TH" and "TL", instead of a 
functional representation such as, for instance, 
21) h i t  (set (H, (hunter  (H) , shot  .at (H, L) ) ) , 
set (L ,  ( l ion(L)  , chasod(L ,H)  ) ) ) 
These "auxiliary" variables are situated on the same level of embedding (by 
definition: their purpose is to flatten embeddings). Co-occurrence of such vari- 
ables on the same level of embedding maps, in simple cases, onto concatenation 
("^") in surface structure: Thus the fonuwing occurrences of variables "TI." and 
"TH" in 20 
20a) seto f  (L, ( . . . ) ; \[TL\] ) , 
se to f (H ,  ( ... ) , \ [TH) ) ,  
h i t (TH,TL) .  
become "((rite hunter) ^ hit ^  (the lion))". Co-occurrence of variables across dif- 
ferent levels of embedding, however, cannot be encoded as simple concatenation. 
These cross-references map onto pronouns. (The conver~ does not hold: There 
are pronouns that do not correspond to this kind of cross-reference; e.g. descrip- 
tional pronouns.) Thus the level-crossing co-occurrence of the variable "TL" in 
20b) seto f (H ,  ( ... shot  at(H,  TL))  . . . .  ) 
se to f (L ,  ( ... ) , \ [TL \ ] ) ,  
h i t ( . . . )  
must map onto a pronoun ("The hunter who shot at it"). A problem arises when 
we try tO translate 19 back into English. If we begin the translation process wiri~ 
"hit(TH,TL)" and map the level-crossing variable "TH" onto a pronoun we get 
"He hit the lion that chased the hunter who shot at it", which is not acceptable 
under the intended interpretation (i.e. coreferentiality of "he" and "the hunter 
..."). This corresponds to a well-known syntactic restriction on the use of cata- 
phoric pronouns. Here we need a rule that works for syntax generation rather 
than for analysis. The following rule is a bit ad-hoc, but it is sufficient for the 
present purpose: We require that the translation of the entire set of expressions 
must begin with the expression defining the top relationship between the indivi- 
dual set expressions (i.e. with the expression corresponding, in most cases, to the 
main verb of the surface sentence), and that level-crossing occurrences of vari- 
ables in this term are la'anslated last. If this restriction makes it impossible to 
translate these variables from, say, left to right (as in the case of example 19, 
where the first variable "TH" is a level-crossing occurrence), it is done right to 
left. This requires that the surface verb form is passivized but it gives the gram- 
matieally correct ordering of full noun phrases and pronouns (i.e. we get rite ori- 
ginal passive sentence 4 for 19). In Bach-Peters-sentences such as 20 both the 
active and passive versions are admissible under this restriction, in keeping with 
the linguistic facts. 
247  
Second-Order  P ro log  Const ructs  and  D iscourse  Represen-  
ta t ion  Theory  
The painless way in which the correct ruth conditions of Bach-Peters-sentences 
and the related sentences virtually fall out of the standard Prolog interpretation 
rules and the definition of the second-order setof-operator is m)t just a lucky 
coincidence. It is rather another case of the intriguing parallel between Natural 
Language and Horn Clause Logic which has become particularly clear in 
Discourse Representation Theory (DR'I). The main hypothesis of DRT is that 
noun phrases (and articles) have no quantificational force on their own but are 
implicitly quantified by the context. This allows DRT to explain, with remarkable 
ease, so-called onkey-sentences, a type of sentence that does not yield to the 
traditional interpretation of noun phrases as quantified statements. The 
correspondence between the logic underlying DRT, and Horn Clause Logic is, in 
this respect, almost one-to-one: In DRT, (indefinite) noun phrases introduce 
discourse refcreuts which are quantified by the (discourse) context in the same 
way as variables in Horn Clause Logic are implicitly quantified by the (chnlse) 
context. 
How do Bach-Peters-sentences fit into DRT? First, we notice the parallel 
between McCawley's ideas and DRT: His "referential indices" correspond, in
their intended fllnction, to tile discourse referents in DRT, and "propositions" 
correspoud to the DRT "conditions" on discourse referents. In the Prolog version 
of Dik's modification of McCawley's ideas, discourse referents correspond ~ the 
value of the third argument in a setof-operator, and the "conditions" of a 
Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) to the expression(s) in its second 
argument. All this applies, for the time being, only to definite noun phrases and 
their representation. If we want to incorporate this into DRT, we must first pro- 
vide for the possiblity to explicitly represent he embedding of noun phrases. 
This kind of explicit embedding was the main reason why we got the right truth 
conditions in the Prolog representation f the example sentences. We must, in 
other words, be allowed to use embedded "conditions" in a DRS. Traditional 
DRT allows for the embedding of entire DRSs, hut not of individual conditions. 
While a sentence like "If John owns a donkey that dislikes him, he beats it" is 
traditionally represented asaflat DRS like 
22) \[UI: 
\[U2: john(ul},  donkey(u2) ,  owns(ul ,u2) ,  d i s l i kes(u2 ,u l ) \ ]  
\ [beats(ul ,u2)\ ] \ ]  
(cf. Kamp 1981, Kanrp 1983, Frey 1983, Guenthner 1983, Guenthner 1985, Kolb 
\]985, Guenthner 1986, Pinkal 1986, Root 1986) this will not do-for the sentences 
with embedded efinite noun phrases considered above. We must somehow 
represent this embedding. And we must, obviously, provide for the interpretation 
rules to use them. These rules will crucially rely on Prolog's meta-call facility to 
implement the double use of embedded set-expressions, a  data structures on the 
one hand and as "executable procedures" (i.e. as provable assertions) on the 
other. 
In traditional DRT mostly indefinite and universal noun phrases (and proper 
names) are used while the Bach-Peters-sentences considered above all contained 
definite noun phrases. But for some of them there are versions with indefinite 
noun phrases, too, and all of them have corresponding plural versions. In order to 
cover all these cases we must introduce, instead of the "conditions" of DRT, 
generalised set expressions without the totality implication of Prolog's "setof" 
(cf. also Webber 1983). We use "set(Def,Card,Gdr,Var,Int,Ext)", where "Def" 
can take the values "def'(inite) or "indef"(inite), and "Card" either an explicit 
dumber, "plur", or a quantifying expression Call", "some" etc.). "Gdr" gives the 
gender of the main noun. "Var"(iable),"Int"(ension) and "Ext"(ension) 
correspond to the three arguments of the setof-operator. The variable "Ext" can 
imw stand for sets as well as for individuals. 
Mapping Pronouns onto Variables 
So far we have mentioned how pronouns correspond, statically, to certain seman- 
tic objects of oar modified DRSs (i.e. to the level-crossing occurrences of vari- 
ables). But it is one of the main goals of DRT to give a unified account of what 
the procedures that actually perform the resolution of pronouns should look like. 
This problem is much harder than the converse one, i.e. the mapping of level- 
crossing variables onto pronouns. The central idea used hel~ by DRT is simple 
(it goes back to Karttunen, together with the term "discoarse r ferent"): Indefinite 
noun phrases in "assertive" contexts create discourse referents which "live on", 
and which can he accessed by anaphoric expressions from points later in the sen- 
tence or discourse. Discourse referents, however, that are created by indefiuites 
in universal, conditional, and negative contexts, "die oft" when the sentence in 
which they occur is processed. This idea corresponds closely to Prolog's concept 
of variables and Skolem constants (the latter standing for existentially quantified 
variables): During the interpretation f a program variables remain accessible by 
name within the clause where they occur. This corresponds to the limited fife- 
span of discourse referents created in universal, condifional, and negative con- 
texts. For Skolem constants in Prolog, however, the scope is the entire program; 
they "live forever", in the szune way as discourse referents created by iarlefinites 
in assertive contexts. And whenever a (definite) pronoun or definite noun phrase 
is encountered, a suitable antecedent must be located among the discourse 
referents till "alive". Its value is then replaced by the value of the discourse 
referent found. If several pronouns access the same discourse referent, hey get, 
of course, the same value. This is the DRT counterpart of unificatiou. 
If we want to have, in our modified notation, discourse referents "float on the sur- 
face" of the corresponding DRSs, accessible lot later anaphoric reference, we 
could write, for the indefinite version of 3, viz. "A hunter who shot at a lion that 
chased him hit it" 
19a) \[TL, TH: 
set (indef, 1, masc, H, (hunter (H) , shot_at  (H, TL) , 
set (indef, 1, neutr,  L, (lion (L) , chased (L, TH) ) , TL) ) , TH) , 
hit  (TH, TL) } 
But there are fimdamenml differences between the treatment of variables in Pro- 
log and DRT: During the interpretation f a Prolog program, bindings of a given 
variable spread throughout a clause to all occurrences of the same name, for- 
wards and backwards. DRT, however, allows mdy torwards, "anaphoric", 
spreading of values. Since a pronoun is processed as soon as it is encountered, it 
can "look for" antecedents exclusively in the DRSs built up by the preceding 
discourse. The interpretation procedures of DRT thus implement, implicitly, the 
syntactic rule that a pronoun can refer auaphorically toa preceding noun phrase 
that c-commands it. Becausc this is, at the same time, the only case where 
anaphora is allowed, the~ interpretation rules block, correctly, cataphora from 
tile pronoun to the indefinite noun phrase in 
23) He sa id  that  a boy had taken the book 
But legitimate cases of cataphora, such as those in Bach-Peters-sentences, are 
blocked by these interpretation rules of DRT, as well. Hence we must weaken the 
accessibility restrictions for anaphoric l~ronominal references somewhat, but not 
too much: If we modelled them on Prolog's unrestricted variable sharing, 23 
would go through in its coreferential reading. 
Accessibility rules of DRT not only block certain correct interpretations, they 
also allow certain blatantly incorrect ones. They would allow, for instance, the 
sentence above with a definite noun phrase, i.e. 
24) He sa id  that the boy had taken the book 
to get an interpretation where pronoun and definite noun phrases are coreferen- 
tial. Why? The correct interpretation f this santence (no corefcrence between 
"he" and "the boy") requires that the definite noun phrase will be able to find an 
antecedent among the pre-existing discourse referents. But then the sentence- 
initial "he" would be equally capable of accessing them, and this would allow the 
prohibited coreferential, cataphoric, reading of the "he" (i.e. "pseudo-cataphora" 
via a common antecedent). The same thing holds for "He hit the lion that chased 
the hunter who shot at it". 
The prohibited reading of this type of sentence can be ruled out on the basis of 
purely syntactic information. The standard rule about pronouns ays that a pro- 
~aoun cannot be coreferential with an noun phrase if it both precedes and c- 
commands it. This rules out the cataphoric use of a pronoun if it c-commands its 
target noun phrase but it allows cases of eataphora such as 
25) ~len he got up, John felt  hungry  
(which are reducible to anaphora) as well as Bach-Peters-sentences (which are 
not), but it blocks the prohibited coreferences in "He hit the llon that chased the 
hunter who shot at it" and "He said that he boy had taken the book". 
Mittwoch (1983) has shown that lhese purely syntactic criteria are not 
sufficiently general to cover all relevant occurrences ofcataphora. In many cases, 
discourse considerations are needed to explain why eataphora is allowed. The 
pronoun can occur, for instance, in a sentential constituent which is demoted, by 
explicit discourse subordlnation markers, to a lower position than warranted by 
syntax. Thus, in 
26) I haven ' t  seen h im yet but John is back 
(from Mittwoch 1983) the "but" functions as an overt marker of topicality for the 
second sentence, demoting the first sentence, and in 
27) He may not  represent  the US at the Un i ted  Nat ions  
anymore,  but  that  does not mean that  Andrew Young has

They tdso block ealaphora in "lie said that a boy had token the book" (tile "he" 
has dragged file aptwopriate discotmse referent inlo the DRS, where it is "iuvisi- 
ble" to the subseqnent "tile boy"). And, liually, it brings a discourse refereut 
accessed by a definite uoun phrase lute focus and makes it the prime caudiate for

embedded DRSs are created (as it is done in standard DRT for "if"- and "every"-
