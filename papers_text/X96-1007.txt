The Text REtrieval Conferences (TRECs)

There have been four Text REtrieval Conferences 
(TRECs); TREC-1 in November 1992, TREC-2 in Au- 
gust 1993, TREC-3 in November 1994 and TREC-4 in 
November 1995. The number of participating systems 
has grown from 25 in TREC-1 to 36 in TREC-4, includ- 
ing most of the major text retrieval software companies 
and most of the universities doing research in text re- 
trieval (see table for some of the participants). The di- 
versity of the participating roups has ensured that 
TREC represents many different approaches to text re- 
trieval, while the emphasis on individual experiments 
evaluated in a common setting has proven to be a major 
strength of TREC. 
The test design and test collection used for document 
detection i  TIPSTER was also used in TREC. The par- 
ticipants ran the various tasks, sent results into NIST for 
evaluation, presented the results at the TREC confer- 
ences, and submitted papers for a proceedings. The test 
collection consists of over 1 million documents from di- 
verse full-text sources, 250 topics, and the set of rele- 
vant documents or "right answers" to those topics. A 
Spanish collection has been built and used during 
TREC-3 and TREC-4, with a total of 50 topics. 
TREC-1 required significant system rebuilding by 
most groups due to the huge increase in the size of the 
document collection (from a traditional test collection of 
several megabytes in size to the 2 gigabyte TIPSTER 
collection). The results from TREC-2 showed signifi- 
cant improvements over the TREC-1 results, and should 
be viewed as the appropriate baseline representing state- 
of-the-art retrieval techniques as scaled up to handling a
2 gigabyte collection. 
TREC-3 therefore provided the first opportunity for 
more complex experimentation. The major experiments 
in TREC-3 included the development of automatic 
query expansion techniques, the use of passages or sub- 
documents o increase the precision of retrieval results, 
and the use of the training information to select only the 
best terms for routing queries. Some groups explored 
hybrid approaches (such as the use of the Rocchio 
methodology in systems not using a vector space mod- 
el), and others tried approaches that were radically dif- 
ferent from their original approaches. 
TREC-4 allowed a continuation of many of these 
complex experiments. The topics were made much 
shorter and this change triggered extensive investiga- 
tions in automatic query expansion. There were also 
five new tasks, called tracks. These were added to help 
focus research on certain known problem areas, and in- 
cluded such issues as investigating searching as an inter- 
active task by examining the process as well as the out- 
come, investigating techniques for merging results from 
the various TREC subcollections, examining the effects 
of corrupted ata, and evaluating routing systems using 
a specific effectiveness measure. Additionally more 
groups participated in a track for Spanish retrieval. 
The TREC conferences have proven to be very sue- 
cessful, allowing broad participation in the overall 
DARPA TIPSTER effort, and causing widespread use of 
a very large test collection. All conferences have had 
very open, honest discussions of technical issues, and 
there have been large amounts of "cross-fertilization" of 
ideas. This will be a continuing effort, with a TREC-5 
conference scheduled inNovember of 1996.
