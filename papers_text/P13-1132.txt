Abstract
Semantic similarity is an essential com-
ponent of many Natural Language Pro-
cessing applications. However, prior meth-
ods for computing semantic similarity of-
ten operate at different levels, e.g., sin-
gle words or entire documents, which re-
quires adapting the method for each data
type. We present a unified approach to se-
mantic similarity that operates at multiple
levels, all the way from comparing word
senses to comparing text documents. Our
method leverages a common probabilistic
representation over word senses in order to
compare different types of linguistic data.
This unified representation shows state-of-
the-art performance on three tasks: seman-
tic textual similarity, word similarity, and
word sense coarsening.
1 Introduction
Semantic similarity is a core technique for many
topics in Natural Language Processing such as
Textual Entailment (Berant et al, 2012), Seman-
tic Role Labeling (Fu?rstenau and Lapata, 2012),
and Question Answering (Surdeanu et al, 2011).
For example, textual similarity enables relevant
documents to be identified for information re-
trieval (Hliaoutakis et al, 2006), while identifying
similar words enables tasks such as paraphrasing
(Glickman and Dagan, 2003), lexical substitution
(McCarthy and Navigli, 2009), lexical simplifica-
tion (Biran et al, 2011), and Web search result
clustering (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013).
Approaches to semantic similarity have often
operated at separate levels: methods for word sim-
ilarity are rarely applied to documents or even sin-
gle sentences (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Radin-
sky et al, 2011; Halawi et al, 2012), while
document-based similarity methods require more
linguistic features, which often makes them in-
applicable at the word or microtext level (Salton
et al, 1975; Maguitman et al, 2005; Elsayed et
al., 2008; Turney and Pantel, 2010). Despite the
potential advantages, few approaches to semantic
similarity operate at the sense level due to the chal-
lenge in sense-tagging text (Navigli, 2009); for ex-
ample, none of the top four systems in the recent
SemEval-2012 task on textual similarity compared
semantic representations that incorporated sense
information (Agirre et al, 2012).
We propose a unified approach to semantic sim-
ilarity across multiple representation levels from
senses to documents, which offers two signifi-
cant advantages. First, the method is applicable
independently of the input type, which enables
meaningful similarity comparisons across differ-
ent scales of text or lexical levels. Second, by op-
erating at the sense level, a unified approach is able
to identify the semantic similarities that exist in-
dependently of the text?s lexical forms and any se-
mantic ambiguity therein. For example, consider
the sentences:
t1. A manager fired the worker.
t2. An employee was terminated from work by
his boss.
A surface-based approach would label the sen-
tences as dissimilar due to the minimal lexical
overlap. However, a sense-based representation
enables detection of the similarity between the
meanings of the words, e.g., fire and terminate.
Indeed, an accurate, sense-based representation is
essential for cases where different words are used
to convey the same meaning.
The contributions of this paper are threefold.
First, we propose a new unified representation of
the meaning of an arbitrarily-sized piece of text,
referred to as a lexical item, using a sense-based
probability distribution. Second, we propose a
novel alignment-based method for word sense dis-
1341
ambiguation during semantic comparison. Third,
we demonstrate that this single representation can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on three sim-
ilarity tasks, each operating at a different lexical
level: (1) surpassing the highest scores on the
SemEval-2012 task on textual similarity (Agirre
et al, 2012) that compares sentences, (2) achiev-
ing a near-perfect performance on the TOEFL syn-
onym selection task proposed by Landauer and
Dumais (1997), which measures word pair sim-
ilarity, and also obtaining state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in terms of the correlation with human
judgments on the RG-65 dataset (Rubenstein and
Goodenough, 1965), and finally (3) surpassing the
performance of Snow et al (2007) in a sense-
coarsening task that measures sense similarity.
2 A Unified Semantic Representation
We propose a representation of any lexical item as
a distribution over a set of word senses, referred
to as the item?s semantic signature. We begin
with a formal description of the representation at
the sense level (Section 2.1). Following this, we
describe our alignment-based disambiguation al-
gorithm which enables us to produce sense-based
semantic signatures for those lexical items (e.g.,
words or sentences) which are not sense annotated
(Section 2.2). Finally, we propose three methods
for comparing these signatures (Section 2.3). As
our sense inventory, we use WordNet 3.0 (Fell-
baum, 1998).
2.1 Semantic Signatures
The WordNet ontology provides a rich net-
work structure of semantic relatedness, connect-
ing senses directly with their hypernyms, and pro-
viding information on semantically similar senses
by virtue of their nearby locality in the network.
Given a particular node (sense) in the network, re-
peated random walks beginning at that node will
produce a frequency distribution over the nodes
in the graph visited during the walk. To ex-
tend beyond a single sense, the random walk may
be initialized and restarted from a set of senses
(seed nodes), rather than just one; this multi-seed
walk produces a multinomial distribution over all
the senses in WordNet with higher probability as-
signed to senses that are frequently visited from
the seeds. Prior work has demonstrated that multi-
nomials generated from random walks over Word-
Net can be successfully applied to linguistic tasks
such as word similarity (Hughes and Ramage,
2007; Agirre et al, 2009), paraphrase recogni-
tion, textual entailment (Ramage et al, 2009),
and pseudoword generation (Pilehvar and Navigli,
2013).
Formally, we define the semantic signature of
a lexical item as the multinomial distribution gen-
erated from the random walks over WordNet 3.0
where the set of seed nodes is the set of senses
present in the item. This representation encom-
passes both when the item is itself a single sense
and when the item is a sense-tagged sentence.
To construct each semantic signature, we use
the iterative method for calculating topic-sensitive
PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002). Let M be the ad-
jacency matrix for the WordNet network, where
edges connect senses according to the rela-
tions defined in WordNet (e.g., hypernymy and
meronymy). We further enrich M by connecting
a sense with all the other senses that appear in its
disambiguated gloss.1 Let ~v(0) denote the prob-
ability distribution for the starting location of the
random walker in the network. Given the set of
senses S in a lexical item, the probability mass
of ~v(0) is uniformly distributed across the senses
si ? S, with the mass for all sj /? S set to zero.
The PageRank may then be computed using:
~v (t) = (1? ?)M~v (t?1) + ? ~v (0) (1)
where at each iteration the random walker may
jump to any node si ? S with probability ?/|S|.
We follow standard convention and set ? to 0.15.
We repeat the operation in Eq. 1 for 30 itera-
tions, which is sufficient for the distribution to
converge. The resulting probability vector ~v(t) is
the semantic signature of the lexical item, as it
has aggregated its senses? similarities over the en-
tire graph. For our semantic signatures we used
the UKB2 off-the-shelf implementation of topic-
sensitive PageRank.
2.2 Alignment-Based Disambiguation
Commonly, semantic comparisons are between
word pairs or sentence pairs that do not have their
lexical content sense-annotated, despite the poten-
tial utility of sense annotation in making seman-
tic comparisons. However, traditional forms of
word sense disambiguation are difficult for short
texts and single words because little or no con-
textual information is present to perform the dis-
ambiguation task. Therefore, we propose a novel

(b) Alignments which maximize the similarities across words in t1 and t2 (the source side of an alignment

alignment-based sense disambiguation that lever-
ages the content of the paired item in order to dis-
ambiguate each element. Leveraging the paired
item enables our approach to disambiguate where
traditional sense disambiguation methods can not
due to insufficient context.
We view sense disambiguation as an alignment
problem. Given two arbitrarily ordered texts, we
seek the semantic alignment that maximizes the
similarity of the senses of the context words in
both texts. To find this maximum we use an align-
ment procedure which, for each word type wi in
item T1, assigns wi to the sense that has the max-
imal similarity to any sense of the word types in
the compared text T2. Algorithm 1 formalizes the
alignment process, which produces a sense dis-
ambiguated representation as a result. Senses are
compared in terms of their semantic signatures,
denoted as function R. We consider multiple def-
initions ofR, defined later in Section 2.3.
As a part of the disambiguation procedure, we
leverage the one sense per discourse heuristic of
Yarowsky (1995); given all the word types in two
compared lexical items, each type is assigned a
single sense, even if it is used multiple times. Ad-
ditionally, if the same word type appears in both
sentences, both will always be mapped to the same
sense. Although such a sense assignment is poten-
tially incorrect, assigning both types to the same
sense results in a representation that does no worse
than a surface-level comparison.
We illustrate the alignment-based disambigua-
tion procedure using the two example sentences t1
and t2 given in Section 1. Figure 1(a) illustrates
example alignments of the first sense of manager
to the first two senses of the word types in sentence
t2 along with the similarity of the two senses?

semantic signatures. For the senses of manager,
sense manager1n obtains the maximal similarity
value to boss1n among all the possible pairings of
the senses for the word types in sentence t2, and as
a result is selected as the sense labeling for man-
ager in sentence t1.3 Figure 1(b) shows the final,
maximally-similar sense alignment of the word
types in t1 and t2. The resulting alignment pro-
duces the following sets of senses:
Pt1 = {manager1n, fire4v, worker1n}
Pt2 = {employee1n, terminate4v, work3n, boss2n}
where Px denotes the corresponding set of senses
of sentence x.
2.3 Semantic Signature Similarity
Cosine Similarity. In order to compare seman-
tic signatures, we adopt the Cosine similarity mea-
sure as a baseline method. The measure is com-
puted by treating each multinomial as a vector and
then calculating the normalized dot product of the
two signatures? vectors.
3We follow Navigli (2009) and denote with wip the i-th
sense of w in WordNet with part of speech p.
1343
However, a semantic signature is, in essence,
a weighted ranking of the importance of Word-
Net senses for each lexical item. Given that the
WordNet graph has a non-uniform structure, and
also given that different lexical items may be of
different sizes, the magnitudes of the probabilities
obtained may differ significantly between the two
multinomial distributions. Therefore, for com-
puting the similarity of two signatures, we also
consider two nonparametric methods that use the
ranking of the senses, rather than their probability
values, in the multinomial.
Weighted Overlap. Our first measure provides
a nonparametric similarity by comparing the simi-
larity of the rankings for intersection of the senses
in both semantic signatures. However, we addi-
tionally weight the similarity such that differences
in the highest ranks are penalized more than differ-
ences in lower ranks. We refer to this measure as
the Weighted Overlap. Let S denote the intersec-
tion of all senses with non-zero probability in both
signatures and rji denote the rank of sense si ? S
in signature j, where rank 1 denotes the highest
rank. The sum of the two ranks r1i and r2i for a
sense is then inverted, which (1) weights higher
ranks more and (2) when summed, provides the
maximal value when a sense has the same rank in
both signatures. The unnormalized weighted over-
lap is then calculated as?|S|i=1(r1i + r2i )?1. Then,
to bound the similarity value in [0, 1], we normal-
ize the sum by its maximum value, ?|S|i=1(2i)?1,
which occurs when each sense has the same rank
in both signatures.
Top-k Jaccard. Our second measure uses the
ranking to identify the top-k senses in a signa-
ture, which are treated as the best representatives
of the conceptual associates. We hypothesize that
a specific rank ordering may be attributed to small
differences in the multinomial probabilities, which
can lower rank-based similarities when one of the
compared orderings is perturbed due to slightly
different probability values. Therefore, we con-
sider the top-k senses as an unordered set, with
equal importance in the signature. To compare two
signatures, we compute the Jaccard Index of the
two signatures? sets:
RJac(Uk, Vk) =
|Uk ? Vk|
|Uk ? Vk|
(2)
whereUk denotes the set of k senses with the high-
est probability in the semantic signature U .

SemEval-2012 Semantic Textual Similarity task.
3 Experiment 1: Textual Similarity
Measuring semantic similarity of textual items has
applications in a wide variety of NLP tasks. As
our benchmark, we selected the recent SemEval-
2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS),
which was concerned with measuring the seman-
tic similarity of sentence pairs. The task received
considerable interest by facilitating a meaningful
comparison between approaches.
3.1 Experimental Setup
Data. We follow the experimental setup used in
the STS task (Agirre et al, 2012), which provided
five test sets, two of which had accompanying
training data sets for tuning system performance.
Each sentence pair in the datasets was given a
score from 0 to 5 (low to high similarity) by hu-
man judges, with a high inter-annotator agreement
of around 0.90 when measured using the Pearson
correlation coefficient. Table 1 lists the number of
sentence pairs in training and test portions of each
dataset.
Comparison Systems. The top-ranking partic-
ipating systems in the SemEval-2012 task were
generally supervised systems utilizing a variety of
lexical resources and similarity measurement tech-
niques. We compare our results against the top
three systems of the 88 submissions: TLsim and
TLsyn, the two systems of S?aric? et al (2012), and
the UKP2 system (Ba?r et al, 2012). UKP2 utilizes
extensive resources among which are a Distribu-
tional Thesaurus computed on 10M dependency-
parsed English sentences. In addition, the sys-
tem utilizes techniques such as Explicit Semantic
Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) and
makes use of resources such as Wiktionary and
Wikipedia, a lexical substitution system based on
supervised word sense disambiguation (Biemann,
2013), and a statistical machine translation sys-
tem. The TLsim system uses the New York Times
Annotated Corpus, Wikipedia, and Google Book
Ngrams. The TLsyn system also uses Google
Book Ngrams, as well as dependency parsing and
named entity recognition.

son correlation r for individual datasets, i.e., MSRpar (Mpar), MSRvid (Mvid), SMTeuroparl (SMTe),
OnWN (OnWN) and SMTnews (SMTn). We also provide scores according to the three official evalua-
tion metrics (i.e., ALL, ALLnrm, and Mean). Rankings are also presented based on the three metrics.
System Configuration. Here we describe the
configuration of our approach, which we have
called Align, Disambiguate and Walk (ADW). The
STS task uses human similarity judgments on an
ordinal scale from 0 to 5. Therefore, in ADW we
adopted a similar approach to generating similar-
ity values to that adopted by other participating
systems, whereby a supervised system is trained
to combine multiple similarity judgments to pro-
duce a final rating consistent with the human an-
notators. We utilized the WEKA toolkit (Hall et
al., 2009) to train a Gaussian Processes regression
model for each of the three training sets (cf. Table
1). The features discussed hereafter were consid-
ered in our regression model.
Main features. We used the scores calculated
using all three of our semantic signature compar-
ison methods as individual features. Although the
Jaccard comparison is parameterized, we avoided
tuning and instead used four features for distinct
values of k: 250, 500, 1000, and 2500.
String-based features. Additionally, because
the texts often contain named entities which are
not present in WordNet, we incorporated the sim-
ilarity values produced by four string-based mea-
sures, which were used by other teams in the STS
task: (1) longest common substring which takes
into account the length of the longest overlap-
ping contiguous sequence of characters (substring)
across two strings (Gusfield, 1997), (2) longest
common subsequence which, instead, finds the
longest overlapping subsequence of two strings
(Allison and Dix, 1986), (3) Greedy String Tiling
which allows reordering in strings (Wise, 1993),
and (4) the character/word n-gram similarity pro-
posed by Barro?n-Ceden?o et al (2010).
We followed S?aric? et al (2012) and used the
models trained on the SMTeuroparl and MSRpar
datasets for testing on the SMTnews and OnWN
test sets, respectively.
3.2 STS Results
Three evaluation metrics are provided by the or-
ganizers of the SemEval-2012 STS task, all of
which are based on Pearson correlation r of human
judgments with system outputs: (1) the correla-
tion value for the concatenation of all five datasets
(ALL), (2) a correlation value obtained on a con-
catenation of the outputs, separately normalized
by least square (ALLnrm), and (3) the weighted
average of Pearson correlations across datasets
(Mean). Table 2 shows the scores obtained by
ADW for the three evaluation metrics, as well as
the Pearson correlation values obtained on each
of the five test sets (rightmost columns). We also
show the results obtained by the three top-ranking
participating systems (i.e., UKP2, TLsim, and TL-
syn). The leftmost three columns show the system
rankings according to the three metrics.
As can be seen from Table 2, our system (ADW)
outperforms all the 88 participating systems ac-
cording to all the evaluation metrics. Our sys-
tem shows a statistically significant improvement
on the SMTnews dataset, with an increase in the
Pearson correlation of over 0.10. MSRpar (MPar)
is the only dataset in which TLsim (S?aric? et al,
2012) achieves a higher correlation with human
judgments. Named entity features used by the TL-
sim system could be the reason for its better per-
formance on the MSRpar dataset, which contains
a large number of named entities.
3.3 Similarity Measure Analysis
To gain more insight into the impact of our
alignment-based disambiguation approach, we
carried out a 10-fold cross-validation on the three
training datasets (cf. Table 1) using the systems
described hereafter.
ADW-MF. To build this system, we utilized our
main features only; i.e., we did not make use of
additional string-based features.
1345
DW. Similarly to ADW-MF, this system utilized
the main features only. In DW, however, we re-
placed our alignment-based disambiguation phase
with a random walk-based WSD system that dis-
ambiguated the sentences separately, without per-
forming any alignment. As our WSD system,
we used UKB, a state-of-the-art knowledge-based
WSD system that is based on the same topic-
sensitive PageRank algorithm used by our ap-
proach. UKB initializes the algorithm from all
senses of the words in the context of a word to
be disambiguated. It then picks the most relevant
sense of the word according to the resulting prob-
ability vector. As the lexical knowledge base of
UKB, we used the same semantic network as that
utilized by our approach for calculating semantic
signatures.
Table 3 lists the performance values of the two
above-mentioned systems on the three training
sets in terms of Pearson correlation. In addition,
we present in the table correlation scores for four
other similarity measures reported by Ba?r et al
(2012):
? Pairwise Word Similarity that comprises of
a set of WordNet-based similarity measures
proposed by Resnik (1995), Jiang and Con-
rath (1997), and Lin (1998b). The aggre-
gation strategy proposed by Corley and Mi-
halcea (2005) has been utilized for extend-
ing these word-to-word similarity measures
for calculating text-to-text similarities.
? Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007) where the high-
dimensional vectors are obtained on Word-
Net, Wikipedia and Wiktionary.
? Distributional Thesaurus where a similarity
score is computed similarly to that of Lin
(1998a) using a distributional thesaurus ob-
tained from a 10M dependency-parsed sen-
tences of English newswire.
? Character n-grams which were also used as
one of our additional features.
As can be seen from Table 3, our alignment-
based disambiguation approach (ADW-MF) is
better suited to the task than a conventional WSD
approach (DW). Another interesting point is the
high scores achieved by the Character n-grams

measure. This confirms that string-based meth-
ods are strong baselines for semantic textual sim-
ilarity. Except for the MSRpar (Mpar) dataset,
our system (ADW-MF) outperforms all other sim-
ilarity measures. The scores obtained by Explicit
Semantic Analysis and Distributional Thesaurus
are not competitive on any dataset. On the other
hand, Pairwise Word Similarity achieves a high
performance on MSRpar and MSRvid datasets,
but performs surprisingly low on the SMTeuroparl
dataset.
4 Experiment 2: Word Similarity
We now proceed from the sentence level to the
word level. Word similarity has been a key prob-
lem for lexical semantics, with significant efforts
being made by approaches in distributional se-
mantics to accurately identify synonymous words
(Turney and Pantel, 2010). Different evaluation
methods exist in the literature for evaluating the
performance of a word-level semantic similarity
measure; we adopted two well-established bench-
marks: synonym recognition and correlating word
similarity judgments with those from human an-
notators.
For synonym recognition, we used the TOEFL
dataset created by Landauer and Dumais (1997).
The dataset consists of 80 multiple-choice syn-
onym questions from the TOEFL test; a word is
paired with four options, one of which is a valid
synonym. Test takers with English as a second
language averaged 64.5% correct. Despite multi-
ple approaches, only recently has the test been an-
swered perfectly (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012), un-
derscoring the challenge of synonym recognition.

Synonym test. ADWJac, ADWWO, and ADWCos
correspond to results with the Jaccard, Weighted
Overlap and Cosine signature comparison mea-
sures, respectively.
For the similarity judgment evaluation, we
used as benchmark the RG-65 dataset created by
Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965). The dataset
contains 65 word pairs judged by 51 human sub-
jects on a scale of 0 to 4 according to their seman-
tic similarity. Ideally, a measure?s similarity judg-
ments are expected to be highly correlated with
those of humans. To be consistent with the previ-
ous literature (Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Agirre
et al, 2009), we used Spearman?s rank correlation
in our experiment.
4.1 Experimental Setup
Our alignment-based sense disambiguation trans-
forms the task of comparing individual words
into that of calculating the similarity of the best-
matching sense pair across the two words. As
there is no training data we do not optimize the k
value for computing signature similarity with the
Jaccard index; instead, we report, for the synonym
recognition and the similarity judgment evalua-
tions, the respective range of accuracies and the
average correlation obtained upon using five val-
ues of k randomly selected in the range [50, 2500]:
678, 1412, 1692, 2358, 2387.
4.2 Word Similarity Results: TOEFL dataset
Table 4 lists the accuracy performance of the sys-
tem in comparison to the existing state of the
art on the TOEFL test. ADWWO, ADWCos,
and ADWJac correspond to our approach when
Weighted Overlap, Cosine, and Jaccard signa-
ture comparison measures are used, respectively.
Despite not being tuned for the task, our model
achieves near-perfect performance, answering all
but three questions correctly with the Cosine mea-

that of Rapp (2003) uses word senses, an approach
that is outperformed by our method.
The errors produced by our system were largely
the result of sense locality in the WordNet net-
work. Table 5 highlights the incorrect responses.
The synonym mistakes reveal cases where senses
of the two words are close in WordNet, indicating
some relatedness. For example, percentage may
be interpreted colloquially as monetary value (e.g.,
?give me my percentage?) and elicits the synonym
of profit in the economic domain, which ADW in-
correctly selects as a synonym.
4.3 Word Similarity Results: RG-65 dataset
Table 6 shows the Spearman?s ? rank correlation
coefficients with human judgments on the RG-65
dataset. As can be seen from the Table, our ap-
proach with the Weighted Overlap signature com-
parison improves over the similar approach of
Hughes and Ramage (2007) which, however, does
not involve the disambiguation step and considers
a word as a whole unit as represented by the set of
its senses.
5 Experiment 3: Sense Similarity
WordNet is known to be a fine-grained sense in-
ventory with many related word senses (Palmer et
al., 2007). Accordingly, multiple approaches have
attempted to identify highly similar senses in or-
der to produce a coarse-grained sense inventory.
We adopt this task as a way of evaluating our sim-
ilarity measure at the sense level.
5.1 Coarse-graining Background
Earlier work on reducing the polysemy of sense
inventories has considered WordNet-based sense
relatedness measures (Mihalcea and Moldovan,
2001) and corpus-based vector representations of

word senses (Agirre and Lopez, 2003; McCarthy,
2006). Navigli (2006) proposed an automatic ap-
proach for mapping WordNet senses to the coarse-
grained sense distinctions of the Oxford Dictio-
nary of English (ODE). The approach leverages
semantic similarities in gloss definitions and the
hierarchical relations between senses in the ODE
to cluster WordNet senses. As current state of
the art, Snow et al (2007) developed a super-
vised SVM classifier that utilized, as its features,
several earlier sense relatedness techniques such
as those implemented in the WordNet::Similarity
package (Pedersen et al, 2004). The classifier
also made use of resources such as topic signatures
data (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004), the WordNet
domain dataset (Magnini and Cavaglia`, 2000), and
the mappings of WordNet senses to ODE senses
produced by Navigli (2006).
5.2 Experimental Setup
We benchmark the accuracy of our similarity mea-
sure in grouping word senses against those of Nav-
igli (2006) and Snow et al (2007) on two datasets
of manually-labeled sense groupings of WordNet
senses: (1) sense groupings provided as a part of
the Senseval-2 English Lexical Sample WSD task
(Kilgarriff, 2001) which includes nouns, verbs and
adjectives; (2) sense groupings included in the
OntoNotes project4 (Hovy et al, 2006) for nouns
and verbs. Following the evaluation methodology
of Snow et al (2007), we combine the Senseval-2
and OntoNotes datasets into a third dataset.
Snow et al (2007) considered sense grouping as
a binary classification task whereby for each word
every possible pairing of senses has to be classified

as either merged or not-merged. We constructed
a simple threshold-based classifier to perform the
same binary classification. To this end, we cal-
culated the semantic similarity of each sense pair
and then used a threshold value t to classify the
pair as merged if similarity ? t and not-merged
otherwise. We sampled out 10% of the dataset for
tuning the value of t, thus adapting our classifier
to the fine granularity of the dataset. We used the
same held-out instances to perform a tuning of the
k value used for Jaccard index, over the same val-
ues of k as in Experiment 1 (cf. Section 3).
5.3 Sense Merging Results
For a binary classification task, we can directly
calculate precision, recall and F-score by con-
structing a contingency table. We show in Ta-
ble 7 the F-score performance of our classifier as
obtained by an averaged 10-fold cross-validation.
Results are presented for all three of the mea-
sures of semantic signature comparison and for
the three datasets: OntoNotes, Senseval-2, and
the two combined. In addition, we show in Ta-
ble 7 the F-score results provided by Snow et al
(2007) for their SVM-based system and for the
mapping-based approach of Navigli (2006), de-
noted by ODE.
Table 7 shows that our methodology yields im-
provements over previous work on both datasets
and for all parts of speech, irrespective of
the semantic signature comparison method used.
Among the three methods, Weighted Overlap
achieves the best performance, which demon-
strates that our transformation of semantic signa-
tures into ordered lists of concepts and calculating
similarity by rank comparison has been helpful.

6 Related Work
Due to the wide applicability of semantic similar-
ity, significant efforts have been made at different
lexical levels. Early work on document-level sim-
ilarity was driven by information retrieval. Vector
space methods provided initial successes (Salton
et al, 1975), but often suffer from data spar-
sity when using small documents, or when doc-
uments use different word types, as in the case
of paraphrases. Later efforts such as LSI (Deer-
wester et al, 1990), PLSA (Hofmann, 2001) and
Topic Models (Blei et al, 2003; Steyvers and Grif-
fiths, 2007) overcame these sparsity issues using
dimensionality reduction techniques or modeling
the document using latent variables. However,
such methods were still most suitable for compar-
ing longer texts. Complementary approaches have
been developed specifically for comparing shorter
texts, such as those used in the SemEval-2012
STS task (Agirre et al, 2012). Most similar to
our approach are the methods of Islam and Inkpen
(2008) and Corley and Mihalcea (2005), who per-
formed a word-to-word similarity alignment; how-
ever, they did not operate at the sense level. Ram-
age et al (2009) used a similar semantic represen-
tation of short texts from random walks on Word-
Net, which was applied to paraphrase recognition
and textual entailment. However, unlike our ap-
proach, their method does not perform sense dis-
ambiguation prior to building the representation
and therefore potentially suffers from ambiguity.
A significant amount of effort has also been put
into measuring similarity at the word level, fre-
quently by approaches that use distributional se-
mantics (Turney and Pantel, 2010). These meth-
ods use contextual features to represent semantics
at the word level, whereas our approach represents
word semantics at the sense level. Most similar to
our approach are those of Agirre et al (2009) and
Hughes and Ramage (2007), which represent word
meaning as the multinomials produced from ran-
dom walks on the WordNet graph. However, un-
like our approach, neither of these disambiguates
the two words being compared, which potentially
conflates the meanings and lowers the similarity
judgment.
Measures of sense relatedness have frequently
leveraged the structural properties of WordNet
(e.g., path lengths) to compare senses. Budanit-
sky and Hirst (2006) provided a survey of such
WordNet-based measures. The main drawback
with these approaches lies in the WordNet struc-
ture itself, where frequently two semantically sim-
ilar senses are distant in the WordNet hierar-
chy. Possible solutions include relying on wider-
coverage networks such as WikiNet (Nastase and
Strube, 2013) or multilingual ones such as Babel-
Net (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012b). Fewer works
have focused on measuring the similarity ? as op-
posed to relatedness ? between senses. The topic
signatures method of Agirre and Lopez (2003)
represents each sense as a vector over corpus-
derived features in order to build comparable sense
representations. However, topic signatures often
produce lower quality representations due to spar-
sity in the local structure of WordNet, especially
for rare senses. In contrast, the random walk
used in our approach provides a denser, and thus
more comparable, representation for all WordNet
senses.
7 Conclusions
This paper presents a unified approach for comput-
ing semantic similarity at multiple lexical levels,
from word senses to texts. Our method leverages
a common probabilistic representation at the sense
level for all types of linguistic data. We demon-
strate that our semantic representation achieves
state-of-the-art performance in three experiments
using semantic similarity at different lexical levels
(i.e., sense, word, and text), surpassing the per-
formance of previous similarity measures that are
often specifically targeted for each level.
In future work, we plan to explore the impact of
the sense inventory-based network used in our se-
mantic signatures. Specifically, we plan to investi-
gate higher coverage inventories such as BabelNet
(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a), which will handle
texts with named entities and rare senses that are
not in WordNet, and will also enable cross-lingual
semantic similarity. Second, we plan to evaluate
our method on larger units of text and formalize
comparison methods between different lexical lev-
els.
