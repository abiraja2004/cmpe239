Abstract 
We present the first known result for named 
entity recognition (NER) in realistic large-
vocabulary spoken Chinese.  We establish this 
result by applying a maximum entropy model, 
currently the single best known approach for 
textual Chinese NER, to the recognition 
output of the BBN LVCSR system on Chinese 
Broadcast News utterances. Our results 
support the claim that transferring NER 
approaches from text to spoken language is a 
significantly more difficult task for Chinese 
than for English.  We propose re-segmenting 
the ASR hypotheses as well as applying post-
classification to improve the performance. 
Finally, we introduce a method of using n-best 
hypotheses that yields a small but nevertheless 
useful improvement NER accuracy.  We use 
acoustic, phonetic, language model, NER and 
other scores as confidence measure.  
Experimental results show an average of 6.7% 
relative improvement in precision and 1.7% 
relative improvement in F-measure. 
1. Introduction 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the first step for 
many tasks in the fields of natural language processing 
and information retrieval. It is a designated task in a 
number of conferences, including the Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC), the Information 
Retrieval and Extraction Conference (IREX), the 
Conferences on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) 
and the recent Automatic Content Extraction 
Conference (ACE).   
 
There has been a considerable amount of work on 
English NER yielding good performance (Tjong Kim 
Sang et al 2002, 2003; Cucerzan & Yarowsky 1999; 
Wu et al 2003). However, Chinese NER is more 
difficult, especially on speech output, due to two 
reasons. First, Chinese has a large number of homonyms 
and the vocabulary used in Chinese person names is an 
open set so more characters/words are unseen in the 
training data. Second, there is no standard definition of 
Chinese words. Word segmentation errors made by 
recognizers may lead to NER errors. Previous work on 
Chinese textual NER includes Jing et al (2003) and Sun 
et al (2003) but there has been no published work on 
NER in spoken Chinese.  
 
Named Entity Recognition for speech is more difficult 
than for text, since the most reliable features for textual 
NER (punctuation, capitalization, and syntactic 
patterns) are often not available in speech output. NER 
on automatically recognized broadcast news was first 
conducted by MITRE in 1997, and was subsequently 
added to Hub-4 evaluation as a task. Palmer et al 
(1999) used error modeling, and Horlock & King (2003) 
proposed discriminative training to handle NER errors; 
both used a hidden Markov model (HMM). Miller et al 
(1999) also reported results in English speech NER 
using an HMM model. In a NIST 1999 evaluation, it 
was found that NER errors on speech arise from a 
combination of ASR errors and errors of the underlying 
NER system. 
 
In this work, we investigate whether the NIST finding 
holds for Chinese speech NER as well. We present the 
first known result for recognizing named entities in 
realistic large-vocabulary spoken Chinese. We propose 
to use the best-known model for Chinese textual NER?
a maximum entropy model?on Chinese speech NER. 
We also propose using re-segmentation and post-
classification to improve this model. Finally, we 
propose to integrate the ASR and NER components to 
optimize NER performance by making use of the n-best 
ASR output.  
2. A Spoken Chinese NER Model 
2.1 LVCSR output  
We use the ASR output from BBN?s Byblos system on  
broadcast news data from the Xinhua News Agency, 
which has 1046 sentences. This system has a character 
error rate of 7%. We had manually annotated them with 
named entities as an evaluation set according to the PFR 
corpus annotation guideline (PFR 2001). 
2.2 A maximum-entropy NER model with post- 
classification  
To establish a baseline spoken Chinese NER model, we 
selected a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach since 
this is currently the single most accurate approach 
known for recognizing named entities in text (Tjong 
Kim Sang et al, 2002, 2003, Jing et al, 2003)1. In the 
CoNLL 2003 NER evaluation, 5 out of 16 systems use 
MaxEnt models and the top 3 results for English and top 
2 results for German were obtained by systems that use 
MaxEnt.  
 
Natural language can be viewed as a stochastic process. 
We can use p(y|x) to denote the probability distribution 
of what we try to predict y (.e.g. part-of-speech tag, 
Named Entity tag) conditioned on what we observe x 
(e.g. previous POS or the actual word). The Maximum 
Entropy principle can be stated as follows: given some 
set of constrains from observations, find the most 
uniform probability distribution (Maximum Entropy) 
p(y|x) that satisfies these constrains:  
0

P y x f x y

In the above equations, fj(xi,yk) is a binary valued feature 
function, and ?j is a weight that indicates how important 
feature fj is for the model. Z(xi) is a normalization factor. 
We estimate the weights using the improved iterative 
scaling (IIS) algorithm.  
 
For our task, we first compare a character-based 
MaxEnt model to a word-based model. Since 
recognition errors also lead to segmentation errors 
which in turn have an adverse effect on the NER 
performance, we experiment with disregarding the word 
boundaries in the ASR hypothesis and instead re-
segment using a MaxEnt segmenter. We also compare 
an approach of one-pass identification/classification to a 
two-pass approach where the identified NE candidates 
are classified later. In addition, we propose a hybrid 
approach of using one-pass identification/classification 
results, discarding the extracted NE tags, and re-
classifying the extracted NE in a second pass.  
                                                 
1 We exclude from the present focus the slight improvements 
that are usually possible to obtain by combination of multiple 
models, usually through ad hoc methods such as voting. 
2.3 Experimental setup  
We use two annotated corpora for training. One is a 
corpus of People?s Daily newspaper from January 1998, 
annotated by the Institute of Computational Linguistics 
of Beijing University (the ?PFR? corpus). This corpus 
consists of about 20k sentences, annotated with word 
segmentation, part-of-speech tags and three named-
entity tags including person (PER), location (LOC) and 
organization (ORG) . We use the first 6k sentences to 
train our NER system. Our system is then evaluated on 
2k sentences from People?s Daily and 1k sentences from 
the BBN ASR output. The results are shown in Tables 1 
and 3. 
  
To compare our system to the IBM baseline described 
in (Jing et al 2003), we need to evaluate our system on 
the same corpus as they used. Among the data they used, 
the only publicly available corpus is a human-generated 
transcription of broadcast news, provided by NIST for 
the Information Extraction ? Entity Recognition 
evaluation (the ?IEER? corpus). This corpus consists of 
10 hours of training data and 1 hour of test data. Ten 
categories of NEs were annotated, including person 
names, location, organization, date, duration, and 
measure. A comparison of results is shown in Table 2. 
2.4 Results and discussion 
From text to speech 
Table 1 compares the NER performances of the same 
MaxEnt model on the Chinese textual PFR test data and 
the one-best BBN ASR hypotheses. We can see a 
significant drop in performance in the latter. These 
results support the claim that transferring NER 
approaches from text to spoken language is a 
significantly more difficult task for Chinese than for 
English.  We argue that this is due to the combination of 
different factors specific to spoken Chinese. First, 
Chinese has a large number of homonyms that leads to a 
degradation in speech recognition accuracy which in 
turn leads to low NER accuracy. Second, the vocabulary 
used in Chinese person names is an open set so many 
characters/words are unseen in the training data.  
 
Comparison to IBM baseline 
Table 2 compares results on IEER data from our 
baseline word-based MaxEnt model compared with that 
of IBM?s HMM word-based model. These two models 
achieved almost the same results, which show that our 
NER system based on MaxEnt is state-of-the-art.  
 
Re-segmentation effect 
Table 3 shows that by discarding word boundaries from 
the ASR hypothesis, and then re-segmenting using our 
MaxEnt segmenter, we obtained a better performance in 
most cases. We believe that some reduction in 
segmentation errors due to recognition errors is obtained 
this way; for example, in the ASR output, two words 
??  ? ? in ???  ?  ?  ???   ?  ? ? are 
misrecognized as one word ????, which can be 
corrected by re-segmentation. 
 
Post-classification effect 
Table 3 also shows that the one-pass 
identification/classification method yields better results 
than the two-pass method. However, there are still 
errors in the one-pass output where the bracketing is 
correct, but the NE classification is wrong. In particular, 
the type ORG is easily confusable with LOC in Chinese. 
Both types of NEs tend to be rather long. We propose a 
hybrid approach by first using the one-pass method to 
extract NEs, and then removing all type information, 
combining words of one NE to a whole NE-word and 
post-classifying all the NE-words again. Our results in 
Figure 1 show that the post-classification combined 
with the one-pass approach performs much better on all 
types.

than on Chinese text data.

baseline. 
Table 3. The character model is better than the word 
model, and one-pass NER is better than two-pass. 
3. Using N-Best Lists to Improve NER 
Miller et al (1999) performed NER on the one-best 
hypothesis of English Broadcast News data.  Palmer & 
Ostendorf (2001) and Horlock & King (2003) carried 
out English NER on word lattices. We are interested in 
investigating how to best utilize the n-best hypothesis 
from the ASR system to improve NER performances. 
From Figure 1, we can see that recall increases as the 
number of hypotheses increases. Thus it would appear 
possible to find a way to make use of the n-best ASR 
output, in order to improve the NER performance. 
However, we can expect it to be difficult to get 
significant improvement since the same figure (Figure 1) 
shows that precision drops much more quickly than 
recall. This is because the nth hypothesis tends to have 
more character errors than the (n-1)th hypothesis, which 
may lead to more NER errors. Therefore the question is, 
given n NE-tagged hypotheses, what is the best way to 
use them to obtain a better NER overall performance 
than by using the one-best hypothesis alone? 
                                                                                                                
One simple approach is to allow all the hypotheses to 
vote on a possible NE output. In simple voting, a 
recognized named-entity is considered correct only 
when it appears in more than 30 percent of the total 
number of all the hypotheses for one utterance. The 
result of this simple voting is shown in Table 4. Next, 
we propose a mechanism of weighted voting using 
confidence measure for each hypothesis. In one 
experiment, we use the MaxEnt NER score as 
confidence measure. In another experiment, we use all 
the six scores (acoustic, language model, number of 
words, number of phones, number of silence, or NER 
score) provided by the BBN ASR system as confidence 
measure. During implementation, an optimizer based on 
Powell?s algorithm is used to find the 6 weights (?k) for 
each score (Sk). For any given hypothesis, confidence 
measure is given by:

3.1 Experimental setup 
We use the n-best hypothesis of 1,046 Broadcast News 
Chinese utterances from the BBN LVCSR system. n 
ranges from one to 300, averaging at 68. Each utterance 
has a reference transcription with no recognition error. 
3.2 Results and discussion 
Table 4 presents the NER results for the reference 
sentence, one best hypothesis, and different n-best 
voting methods. Results for the reference sentences 
show the upper bound performance (68% F-measure) of 
applying a MaxEnt NER system trained from the 
Chinese text corpus (e.g., PFR) to Chinese speech 
output (e.g., Broadcast News). From Table 4, we can 
conclude that it is possible to improve NER precision by 
using n-best hypothesis by finding the optimized 
combination of different acoustic, language model, 
NER, and other scores. In particular, since most errors 
in Chinese ASR seem to be for person names, using 
NER score on the n-best hypotheses can improve 
recognition results by a relative 6.7% in precision and 
1.7% in F-measure.

4. Conclusion 
We present the first known result for named entity 
recognition (NER) in realistic large-vocabulary spoken 
Chinese.  We apply a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) 
based system to the n-best output of the BBN LVCSR 
system on Chinese Broadcast News utterances. Our 
results support the claim that transferring NER 
approaches from text to spoken language is a 
significantly more difficult task for Chinese than for 
English.  We show that re-segmenting the ASR 
hypotheses improves the NER performance by 24%. We 
also show that applying post-classification improves the 
NER performance by 13%. Finally, we introduce a 
method of using n-best hypotheses that yields a useful 
6.7% relative improvement in NER precision, and 1.7% 
relative improvement in F-measure, by weighted voting.
