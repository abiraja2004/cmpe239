This paper describes an accurate and 
robust text alignment system for struc- 
turally different languages. Among 
structurally different languages uch as 
Japanese and English, there is a limitation 
on the amount of word correspondences 
that can be statistically acquired. The 
proposed method makes use of two kinds 
of word correspondences in aligning bilin- 
gual texts. One is a bilingual dictionary of 
general use. The other is the word corre- 
spondences that are statistically acquired 
in the alignment process. Our method 
gradually determines sentence pairs (an- 
chors) that correspond to each other by re- 
laxing parameters. The method, by com- 
bining two kinds of word correspondences, 
achieves adequate word correspondences 
for complete alignment. As a result, texts 
of various length and of various genres 
in structurally different languages can be 
aligned with high precision. Experimen- 
tal results show our system outperforms 
conventional methods for various kinds of 
Japanese-English texts. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts 
are promising for various applications(i.e., lexical 
knowledge xtraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et 
al., 1993; Smadja et al, 1996; Dagan and Church, 
1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al, 
1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; 
Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al, 1992) and infor- 
mation retrieval (Sato, 1992)). Most of these works 
assume voluminous aligned corpora. 
Many methods have been proposed to align bilin- 
gual corpora. One of the major approaches i  based 
on the statistics of simple features uch as sentence 
length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in 
characters (Gale and Church, 1993). These tech- 
niques are widely used because they can be imple- 
mented in an efficient and simple way through dy- 
namic programing. However, their main targets are 
rigid translations that are almost literal translations. 
In addition, the texts being aligned were structurally 
similar European languages (i.e., English-French, 
English-German). 
The simple-feature based approaches don't work 
in flexible translations for structurally different lan- 
guages uch as Japanese and English, mainly for the 
following two reasons. One is the difference in the 
character types of the two languages. Japanese has 
three types of characters (Hiragana, Katakana, and 
Kanji), each of which has different amounts of in- 
formation. In contrast, English has only one type 
of characters. The other is the grammatical and 
rhetorical difference of the two languages. First, the 
systems of functional (closed) words are quite differ- 
ent from language to language. Japanese has a quite 
different system of closed words, which greatly influ- 
ence the length of simple features. Second, due to 
rhetorical difference, the number of multiple match 
(i.e., 1-2, 1-3, 2-1 and so on) is more than that among 
European languages. Thus, it is impossible in gen- 
eral to apply the simple-feature based methods to 
Japanese-English translations. 
One alternative alignment method is the lexicon- 
based approach that makes use of the word- 
correspondence knowledge of the two languages. 
(Church, 1993) employed n-grams hared by two lan- 
guages. His method is also effective for Japanese- 
English computer manuals both containing lots of 
the same alphabetic technical terms. However, 
the method cannot be applied to general transla- 
tions in structurally different languages. (Kay and 
Roscheisen, 1993) proposed a relaxation method to 
iteratively align bilingual texts using the word cor- 
respondences acquired during the alignment pro- 
cess. Although the method works well among Euro- 
pean languages, the method does not work in align- 
ing structurally different languages. In Japanese- 
English translations, the method does not capture 
enough word correspondences to permit alignment. 
As a result, it can align only some of the two texts. 
This is mainly because the syntax and rhetoric are 
131 
greatly differ in the two languages even in literal 
translations. The number of confident word cor- 
respondences of words is not enough for complete 
alignment. Thus, the problem cannot be addressed 
as long as the method relies only on statistics. Other 
methods in the lexicon-based approach embed lex- 
ical knowledge into stochastic models (Wu, 1994; 
Chen, 1993), but these methods were tested using 
rigid translations. 
To tackle the problem, we describe in this 
paper a text alignment system that uses both 
statistics and bilingual dictionaries at the same 
time. Bilingual dictionaries are now widely 
available on-line due to advances in CD-ROM 
technologies. For example, English-Spanish, 
English-French, English-German, English-Japanese, 
Japanese-French, Japanese-Chinese and other dic- 
tionaries are now commercially available. It is rea- 
sonable to make use of these dictionaries in bilingual 
text alignment. The pros and cons of statistics and 
online dictionaries are discussed below. They show 
that statistics and on-line dictionaries are comple- 
mentary in terms of bilingual text alignment. 
Statistics Mer i t  Statistics is robust in the sense 
that it can extract context-dependent usage 
of words and that it works well even if word 
segmentation 1 is not correct. 
Statistics Demer i t  The amount of word corre- 
spondences acquired by statistics is not enough 
for complete alignment. 
D ict ionar ies  Mer i t  They can contain the infor- 
mation about words that appear only once in 
the corpus. 
Dictionaries Demer i t  They cannot capture 
context-dependent keywords in the corpus and 
are weak against incorrect word segmentation. 
Entries in the dictionaries differ from author to 
author and are not always the same as those in 
the corpus. 
Our system iteratively aligns sentences by using 
statistical and on-line dictionary word correspon- 
dences. The characteristics of the system are as fol- 
lows. 
? The system performs well and is robust for var- 
ious lengths (especially short) and various gen- 
res of texts. 
? The system is very economical because it as- 
sumes only online-dictionaries of general use 
and doesn't require the labor-intensive con- 
struction of domain-specific dictionaries. 
? The system is extendable by registering statis- 
tically acquired word correspondences into user 
dictionaries. 
1In Japanese, there are no explicit delimiters between 
words. The first task for alignment is , therefore, to 
divide the text stream into words. 
We will treat hereafter Japanese-English transla- 
tions although the proposed method is language in- 
dependent. 
The construction of the paper is as follows. First, 
Section 2 offers an overview of our alignment system. 
Section 3 describes the entire alignment algorithm 
in detail. Section 4 reports experimental results 
for various kinds of Japanese-English texts including 
newspaper editorials, scientific papers and critiques 
on economics. The evaluation is performed from 
two points of view: precision-recall of alignment and 
word correspondences acquired during alignment. 
Section 5 concerns related works and Section 6 con- 
cludes the paper.

Figure 1: Overview of the Alignment System 
Figure 1 overviews our alignment system. The 
input to the system is a pair of Japanese and En- 
glish texts, one the translation of the other. First, 
sentence boundaries are found in both texts using 
finite state transducers. The texts are then part- 
of-speech (POS) tagged and separated into origi- 
nal form words z. Original forms of English words 
are determined by 80 rules using the POS infor- 
mation. From the word sequences, we extract only 
nouns, adjectives, adverbs verbs and unknown words 
(only in Japanese) because Japanese and English 
closed words are different and impede text align- 
ment. These pre-processing operation can be easily 
implemented with regular expressions. 
2We use in this phase the JUMAN morphological 
analyzing system (Kurohashi et al, 1994) for tagging 
Japanese texts and Brill's transformation-based tagger 
(Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994) for tagging English texts (JU- 
MAN: ftp://ftp.aist-nara.ac.jp/pub/nlp/tools/juman/ 
Brih ftp://ftp.cs.jhu.edu/pub/brill). We would like to 
thank all people concerned for providing us with the 
tools.

The initial state of the algorithm is a set of al- 
ready known anchors (sentence pairs). These are de- 
termined by article boundaries, section boundaries 
and paragraph boundaries. In the most general case, 
initial anchors are only the first and final sentence 
pairs of both texts as depicted in Figure 2. Pos- 
sible sentence correspondences are determined from 
the anchors. Intuitively, the number of possible cor- 
respondences for a sentence is small near anchors, 
while large between the anchors. In this phase, the 
most important point is that each set of possible 
sentence correspondences should include the correct 
correspondence. 
The main task of the system is to find anchors 
from the possible sentence correspondences by us- 
ing two kinds of word correspondences: statistical 
word correspondences and word correspondences as 
held in a bilingual dictionary 3. By using both cor- 
respondences, the sentence pair whose correspon- 
dences exceeds a pre-defined threshold is judged as 
an anchor. These newly found anchors make word 
correspondences more precise in the subsequent ses- 
sion. By repeating this anchor setting process with 
threshold reduction, sentence correspondences are 
gradually determined from confident pairs to non- 
confident pairs. The gradualism of the algorithm 
makes it robust because anchor-setting errors in the 
last stage of the algorithm have little effect on over- 
all performance. The output of the algorithm is the 
alignment result (a sequence of anchors) and word 
correspondences as by-products.

3.1 Stat ist ics  Used  
In this section, we describe the statistics used to 
decide word correspondences. From many similar- 
ity metrics applicable to the task, we choose mu- 
tual information and t-score because the relaxation 
of parameters can be controlled in a sophisticated 
manner. Mutual information represents the similar- 
ity on the occurrence distribution and t-score rep- 
resents the confidence of the similarity. These two 
parameters permit more effective relaxation than the 
single parameter used in conventional methods(Kay 
and Roscheisen, 1993). 
Our basic data structure is the alignable sen- 
tence matrix (ASM) and the anchor matrix (AM). 
ASM represents possible sentence correspondences 
and consists of ones and zeros. A one in ASM in- 
dicates the intersection of the column and row con- 
stitutes a possible sentence correspondence. On the 
contrary, AM is introduced to represent how a sen- 
tence pair is supported by word correspondences. 
The i-j Element of AM indicates how many times 
the corresponding words appear in the i-j sentence 
pair. As alignment proceeds, the number of ones in 
ASM reduces, while the elements of AM increase. 
Let pi be a sentence set comprising the ith 
Japanese sentence and its possible English corre- 
spondences as depicted in Figure 3. For example, P2 
is the set comprising Jsentence2, Esentence2 and 
Esentencej, which means Jsentence2 has the pos- 
sibility of aligning with Esentence2 or Esentencej. 
The pis can be directly derived from ASM.

Figure 3: Possible Sentence Correspondences 
We introduce the contingency matrix (Fung and 
Church, 1994) to evaluate the similarity of word oc- 
currences. Consider the contingency matrix shown 
Table 1, between Japanese word wjp n and English 
word Weng. The contingency matrix shows: (a) the 
number of pis in which both wjp, and w~ng were 
found, (b) the number of pis in which just w~.g was 
found, (c) the number of pis in which just wjp, was 
133 
found, (d) the number of pis in which neither word 
was found. Note here that pis overlap each other 
and w~,~ 9 may be double counted in the contingency 
matrix. We count each w~,,~ only once, even if it 
occurs more than twice in pls. 
\] Wjpn 
Weng I a b 
I c d 
Table 1: Contingency Matrix 
If Wjpn and weng are good translations of one an- 
other, a should be large, and b and c should be small. 
In contrast, if the two are not good translations of 
each other, a should be small, and b and c should 
be large. To make this argument more precise, we 
introduce mutual information: 
log prob(wjpn, Weng) 
prob( w p. )prob( won9 )
The probabilities are: 
a+c a+c 
prob(wjpn) - a T b + c W d - Y 
a+b a+b 
pr ob( w eng ) - a+b+c+d - M 
a a 
prob( wjpn ,Weng ) -- a+b+c+d-  M 
Unfortunately, mutual information is not reliable 
when the number of occurrences i small. Many 
words occur just once which weakens the statistics 
approach. In order to avoid this, we employ t-score, 
defined below, where M is the number of Japanese 
sentences. Insignificant mutual information values 
are filtered out by thresholding t-score. For exam- 
ple, t-scores above 1.65 are significant at the p > 
0.95 confidence level. 
t ~ prob(wjpn, Weng) - prob(wjpn)prob(weng) 
~/-~prob( wjpn ,Weng ) 
3.2 Basic Alignment Algorithm 
Our basic algorithm is an iterative adjustment of the 
Anchor Matrix (AM) using the Alignable Sentence 
Matrix (ASM). Given an ASM, mutual information 
and t-score are computed for all word pairs in possi- 
ble sentence correspondences. A word combination 
exceeding a predefined threshold is judged as a word 
correspondence. In order to find new anchors, we 
combine these statistical word correspondences with 
the word correspondences in a bilingual dictionary. 
Each element of AM, which represents a sentence 
pair, is updated by adding the number of word cor- 
respondences in the sentence pair. A sentence pair 
containing more than a predefined number of corre- 
sponding words is determined to be a new anchor. 
The detailed algorithm is as follows. 
3.2.1 Constructing Initial ASM 
This step constructs the initial ASM. If the texts 
contain M and N sentences respectively, the ASM 
is an M x N matrix. First, we decide a set of an- 
chors using article boundaries, section boundaries 
and so on. In the most general case, initial anchors 
are the first and last sentences of both texts as de- 
picted in Figure 2. Next, possible sentence corre- 
spondences are generated. Intuitively, true corre- 
spondences are close to the diagonal linking the two 
anchors. We construct he initial ASM using such 
a function that pairs sentences near the middle of 
the two anchors with as many as O(~/~) (L is the 
number of sentences existing between two anchors) 
sentences in the other text because the maximum 
deviation can be stochastically modeled as O(~rL) 
(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). The initial ASM has 
little effect on the alignment performance so long as 
it contains all correct sentence correspondences. 
3.2.2 Constructing AM 
This step constructs an AM when given an ASM 
and a bilingual dictionary. Let thigh, tlow, Ihigh and 
Izow be two thresholds for t-score and two thresholds 
for mutual information, respectively. Let ANC be 
the minimal number of corresponding words for a 
sentence pair to be judged as an anchor. 
First, mutual information and t-score are com- 
puted for all word pairs appearing in a possible sen- 
tence correspondence in ASM. We use hereafter the 
word correspondences whose mutual information ex- 
ceeds Itow and whose t-score exceeds ttow. For all 
possible sentence correspondences Jsentencei and 
Esentencej (any pair in ASM), the following op- 
erations are applied in order. 
1. If the following three conditions hold, add 3 
to the i-j element of AM. (1) Jsentencei and 
Esentencej contain a bilingual dictionary word 
correspondence (wjpn and w,ng). (2) w~na does 
not occur in any other English sentence that 
is a possible translation of Jsentencei. (3) 
Jsentencei and Esentencej do not cross any 
sentence pair that has more than ANC word 
correspondences. 
2. If the following three conditions hold, add 3 
to the i-j element of AM. (1) Jsentencei and 
Esentencej contain a stochastic word corre- 
spondence (wjpn and w~na) that has mutual 
information Ihig h and whose t-score exceeds 
thigh. (2) w~g does not occur in any other 
English sentence that is a possible translation 
of Jsentencei. (3) Jsentencei and Esentencej 
do not cross any sentence pair that has more 
than ANC word correspondences. 
3. If the following three conditions hold, add 1 
to the i-j element of AM. (1) Jsentencei and 
Esentencej contain a stochastic word corre- 
spondence (wjp~ and we~g) that has mutual 
134 
information Itoto and whose t-score exceeds 
ttow. (2) w~na does not occur in any other 
English sentence that is a possible translation 
of Jsentencei. (3) Jsentencei and Esentencej 
does not cross any sentence pair that has more 
than ANC word correspondences. 
The first operation deals with word correspon- 
dences in the bilingual dictionary. The second op- 
eration deals with stochastic word correspondences 
which are highly confident and in many cases involve 
domain specific keywords. These word correspon- 
dences are given the value of 3. The third operation 
is introduced because the number of highly confi- 
dent corresponding words are too small to align all 
sentences. Although word correspondences acquired 
by this step are sometimes false translations of each 
other, they play a crucial role mainly in the final 
iterations phase. They are given one point. 
3.2.3 Adjusting ASM 
This step adjusts ASM using the AM constructed 
by the above operations. The sentence pairs that 
have at least ANC word correspondences are deter- 
mined to be new anchors. By using the new set of 
anchors, a new ASM is constructed using the same 
method as used for initial ASM construction. 
Our algorithm implements a kind of relaxation by 
gradually reducing flow, Izow and ANC,  which en- 
ables us to find confident sentence correspondences 
first. As a result, our method is more robust than 
dynamic programing techniques against he shortage 
of word-correspondence knowledge. 
4 Exper imenta l  Resu l ts  
In this section, we report he result of experiments 
on aligning sentences in bilingual texts and on sta- 
tistically acquired word correspondences. The texts 
for the experiment varied in length and genres as 
summarized in Table 2. Texts 1 and 2 are editorials 
taken from 'Yomiuri Shinbun' and its English ver- 
sion 'Daily Yomiuri'. This data was distributed elec- 
trically via a WWW server 4. The first two texts clar- 
ify the systems's performance on shorter texts. Text 
3 is an essay on economics taken from a quarterly 
publication of The International House of Japan. 
Text 4 is a scientific survey on brain science taken 
from 'Scientific American' and its Japanese version 
'Nikkei Science '5. Jpn  and Eng in Table2 represent 
the number of sentences in the Japanese and English 
texts respectively. The remaining table entries how

categories of matches by manual alignment and in- 
dicate the difficulty of the task. 
Our evaluation focuses on much smaller texts than 
those used in other study(Brown and others, 1993; 
Gale and Church, 1993; Wu, 1994; Fung, 1995; Kay 
and Roscheisen, 1993) because our main targets are 
well-separated articles. However, our method will 
work on larger and noisy sets too, by using word 
anchors rather than using sentence boundaries as 
segment boundaries. In such a case, the method 
constructing initial ASM needs to be modified. 
We briefly report here the computation time of 
our method. Let us consider Text 4 as an exam- 
ple. After 15 seconds for full preprocessing, the 
first iteration took 25 seconds with tto~ = 1.55 and 
Izow = 1.8. The rest of the algorithm took 20 sec- 
onds in all. This experiment was performed on a 
SPARC Station 20 Model tIS21. From the result, 
we may safely say that our method can be applied 
to voluminous corpora. 
4.1 Sentence Alignment 
Table 3 shows the performance on sentence align- 
ments for the texts in Table 2. Combined, Statis- 
tics and D ic t ionary  represent the methods using 
both statistics and dictionary, only statistics and 
only dictionary, respectively. Both Combined  and 
Dictionary use a CD-ROM version of a Japanese- 
English dictionary containing 40 thousands entries. 
Statistics repeats the iteration by using statistical 
corresponding words only. This is identical to Kay's 
method (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) except for the 
statistics used. D ic t ionary  performs the iteration 
of the algorithm by using corresponding words of 
the bilingual dictionary. This delineates the cover- 
age of the dictionary. The parameter setting used 
for each method was the optimum as determined by 
empirical tests. 
In Table 3, PRECISION delineates how many of 
the aligned pairs are correct and RECALL delineates 
how many of the manual alignments we included 
in systems output. Unlike conventional sentence- 
chunk based evaluations, our result is measured on 
the sentence-sentence basis. Let us consider a 3-1 
matching. Although conventional evaluations can 
make only one error from the chunk, three errors 
may arise by our evaluation. Note that our evalua- 
tion is more strict than the conventional one, espe- 
cially for difficult texts, because they contain more 
complex matches. 
For Text 1 and Text 2, both the combined 
method and the dictionary method perform much 
better than the statistical method. This is ob- 
viously because statistics cannot capture word- 
correspondences in the case of short texts. 
Text 3 is easy to align in terms of both the com- 
plexity of the alignment and the vocabularies used. 
All methods performed well on this text.

much better than D ic t ionary .  The reason for this is 
that Text 4 concerns brain science and the bilingual 
dictionaries of general use did not contain domain 
specific keywords. On the other hand, the combined 
and statistical methods well capture the keywords 
as described in the next section. Note here that 
Combined  performs better than Stat is t ics  in the 
case of longer texts, too. There is clearly a limitation 
in the amount of word correspondences that can be 
captured by statistics. In summary, the performance 
of Combined  is better than either Stat ist ics  or 
D ic t ionary  for all texts, regardless of text length 
and the domain. 
correspondences were not used. 
Although these word correspondences are very ef- 
fective for sentence alignment ask, they are unsat- 
isfactory when regarded as a bilingual dictionary. 
For example, ' 7 7 Y ~' ~ ~ ~n.MR I ' in Japanese 
is the translation of 'functional MRI'. In Table 4, the 
correspondence of these compound nouns was cap- 
tured only in their constituent level. (Haruno et al, 
1996) proposes an efficient n-gram based method to 
extract bilingual collocations from sentence aligned 
bilingual corpora. 
5 Re la ted  Work  
4.2 Word Correspondence 
In this section, we will demonstrate how well the pro- 
posed method captured omain specific word corre- 
spondences by using Text 4 as an example. Table 4 
shows the word correspondences that have high mu- 
tual information. These are typical keywords con- 
cerning the non-invasive approach to human brain 
analysis. For example, NMR, MEG, PET, CT, MRI 
and functional MRI are devices for measuring brain 
activity from outside the head. These technical 
terms are the subjects of the text and are essential 
for alignment. However, none of them have their 
own entry in the bilingual dictionary, which would 
strongly obstruct he dictionary method. 
It is interesting to note that the correct Japanese 
translation of 'MEG' is ' ~{i~i~\]'. The Japanese mor- 
phological analyzer we used does not contain an en- 
try for ' ~i~i\[~' and split it into a sequence of three 
characters ' ~ ' , '  ~ '  and ' \[\]'. Our system skillfully 
combined ' ~i' and ' \[ \] '  with 'MEG', as a result of 
statistical acquisition. These word correspondences 
greatly improved the performance for Text 4. Thus, 
the statistical method well captures the domain spe- 
cific keywords that are not included in general-use 
bilingual dictionaries. The dictionary method would 
yield false alignments if statistically acquired word 
Sentence alignment between Japanese and English 
was first explored by Sato and Murao (Murao, 1991). 
They found (character or word) length-based ap- 
proaches were not appropriate due to the structural 
difference of the two languages. They devised a 
dynamic programming method based on the num- 
ber of corresponding words in a hand-crafted bilin- 
gual dictionary. Although some results were promis- 
ing, the method's performance strongly depended on 
the domain of the texts and the dictionary entries. 
(Utsuro et al, 1994) introduced a statistical post- 
processing step to tackle the problem. He first ap- 
plied Sato's method and extracted statistical word 
correspondences from the result of the first path. 
Sato's method was then reiterated using both the ac- 
quired word correspondences and the hand-crafted 
dictionary. His method involves the following two 
problems. First, unless the hand-crafted ictionary 
contains domain specific key words, the first path 
yields false alignment, which in turn leads to false 
statistical correspondences. Because it is impossible 
in general to cover key words in all domains, it is 
inevitable that statistics and hand-crafted bilingual 
dictionaries must be used at the same time.

Table 4: Statistically Acquired Keywords 
The proposed method involves iterative alignment 
which simultaneously uses both statistics and a 
bilingual dictionary. 
Second, their score function is not reliable espe- 
cially when the number of corresponding words con- 
tained in corresponding sentences is small. Their 
method selects a matching type (such as 1-1, 1-2 
and 2-1) according to the number of word correspon- 
dences per contents word. However, in many cases, 
there are a few word translations in a set of corre- 
sponding sentences. Thus, it is essential to decide 
sentence alignment on the sentence-sentence basis. 
Our iterative approach decides sentence alignment 
level by level by counting the word correspondences 
between a Japanese and an English sentence. 
(Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995) proposed 
methods to find Chinese-English word correspon- 
dences without aligning parallel texts. Their mo- 
tivation is that structurally different languages such 
as Chinese-English and Japanese-English are diffi- 
cult to align in general. Their methods bypassed 
aligning sentences and directly acquired word cor- 
respondences. Although their approaches are ro- 
bust for noisy corpora and do not require any in- 
formation source, aligned sentences are necessary 
for higher level applications uch as well-grained 
translation template acquisition (Matsumoto et as., 
1993; Smadja et al, 1996; Haruno et al, 1996) 
and example-based translation (Sato and Nagao, 
1990). Our method performs accurate alignment for 
such use by combining the detailed word correspon- 
dences: statistically acquired word correspondences 
and those from a bilingual dictionary of general use. 
(Church, 1993) proposed char_align that makes 
use of n-grams shared by two languages. This 
kind of matching techniques will be helpful in our 
dictionary-based approach in the following situation: 
Entries of a bilingual dictionary do not completely 
match the word in the corpus but partially do. By 
using the matching technique, we can make the most 
of the information compiled in bilingual dictionaries. 
6 Conc lus ion  
We have described a text alignment method for 
structurally different languages. Our iterative 
method uses two kinds of word correspondences at 
the same time: word correspondences acquired by 
statistics and those of a bilingual dictionary. By 
combining these two types of word correspondences, 
the method covers both domain specific keywords 
not included in the dictionary and the infrequent 
words not detected by statistics. As a result, our 
method outperforms conventional methods for texts 
of different lengths and different domains.
