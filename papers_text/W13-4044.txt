Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to infer dialogue acts using the notion of
tacit contracts. We describe the interper-
sonal linguistic features that our analysis
grammar can identify in uttered texts and
present an inference procedure that strictly
separates the semantic and pragmatic steps
of utterance understanding, thereby meet-
ing a higher degree of modularity, a pre-
requisite for extending robot functionality.

1 Introduction
John is reading ?Merlin?, when the door bell rings.
He cannot walk, but his intelligent wheelchair Rol-
land is nearby. He says: ?Rolland, I need to open
the door. Can you take me there?? Rolland re-
sponds ?Sure, I?m coming!?, comes to him, waits
for him to sit comfortably, and then says ?Let?s
go!? before driving him to the door side where
John is able to reach the door handle.
So seamless are the interactions in our Wizard-
of-Oz experiment (Anastasiou et al, 2012; Vale
and Mast, 2012b) yet so difficult for an intelligent
wheelchair. How is it to know that ?I need to open
the door? and ?Can you take me there?? should
not be understood separately as a statement and a
question but together as a command to move to-
wards the door for enabling the user to open it?
Each utterance is an action that affects the inter-
active situation. Not only does it construe events,
but it also constitutes exchanges between interac-
tants such as stating the speaker?s need of perform-
ing an action and asking about the listener?s capa-
bility of providing a service.
All speaking robots need some method of cop-
ing with this dual character of situated utterances.
A frequent approach is Dialogue Act Detection,
a family of statistical methods trained on human-
annotated corpora (Allen and Core, 1997; Juraf-
sky et al, 1997; Jurafsky et al, 1997; Jekat et al,
1995). An alternative approach is Plan Recogni-
tion, which consists of using a planner having lin-
guistic meaning and a domain model as inputs. We
depart from this tradition by proposing a contrac-
tual approach in which semantic and pragmatic as-
pects of understanding are symbolically explored
in separate steps of inference.
The main rationale for not pursuing the detec-
tion of dialogue acts as patterns in the uttered text
is that the intended effect of an utterance is not to
be found in the wording (Marcu, 1997); and the
rationale for not taking construed events directly
as plan steps is that the functional roles of inter-
actants in cooperative work are decisive for inter-
preting attitudes.
In this paper, we present an automatic seman-
tic analysis of the interpersonal features of lin-
guistic units and propose a compatible three-step
procedure consisting of transformation, contex-
tualization and inference to enable an intelligent
wheelchair to understand implied dialogue acts.
In the following two sections, we describe prior
approaches to understanding interpersonal mean-
ing and discuss their relevance for our approach.
Then we introduce a classification of interper-
sonal linguistic features and explain how we re-
express these implicit features of language explic-
itly in a standardised format. Finally, we describe
the procedure used by the pragmatic module of
our wheelchair in order to contextualise utterance
meaning and infer implied dialogue acts.
2 Dialogue Act Detection
Dialogue act detection is the most frequently used
approach for dealing with the interpersonal aspect
of dialogue. In this section, we review two frame-
works for dialogue act detection: the annotation
standard DAMSL (Allen and Core, 1997) and the
294
dialogue act component of the successful applica-
tion Verbmobil (Jekat et al, 1995).
2.1 DAMSL and Derivates
The tagging system of Dialogue Act Markup in
Several Layers (DAMSL) is a tag system for
speaker?s intention. It uses binary decision trees
for tagging utterances with up to four attributes
(layers) of the speaker?s intention: communicative
status, information level, backward- and forward-
looking functions. DAMSL has been thoroughly
tested for annotation (Core and Allen, 1997; Ju-
rafsky et al, 1997; Ivanovic, 2005; Stolcke et
al., 2000) with inter-annotator agreement reach-
ing approx. 70-85%. Recent attempts to au-
tomatise DAMSL dialogue act detection using sta-
tistical methods (Core, 1997; Rosset and Lamel,
2004; Rangarajan Sridhar et al, 2007; Rosset et
al., 2008; Rangarajan Sridhar et al, 2009) reach
similar accuracy.
However, high accuracy scores need to be rel-
ativized, as precision and recall may be very low
for most tags? Rangarajan Sridhar et al (2009)
report <1% for all but the two most frequent tags.
Moreover, agreement rates tell nothing about the
severity of mistagging for application usage.
The second and most compromising issue lies in
the annotation scheme itself. Context-dependent
decision trees turn utterance tagging into guess
work, since utterances map differently to world
models in different situations. For instance, there
is danger ?of annotators confusing surface form
with [contextual] speaker intent, for instance la-
belling an info-request in the form of a statement
as an other-statement? (Stent, 2000).
The third issue concerns applicability. The
DAMSL research community has built annotated
corpora and automated dialogue act detection.
Only lately, there has been research on automatic
learning of dialogue act flow patterns on large
manually annotated corpora of dialogue. Whether
these dialogue act flows will be usable in real ap-
plied systems is yet to be determined.
2.2 Verbmobil
A different approach to Dialogue Act Detection is
followed by Verbmobil, a successful applied dia-
logue system for travel booking. It uses 55 types
of dialogue act, tailored to the particular appli-
cation domain of travel booking, e.g. Request-
Suggest-Duration. Classification of utterances is
achieved by detecting keywords and syntactic pat-
terns in the word sequence of the utterance and
matching them against keyword and pattern lists
which are typical for each dialogue act type. Am-
biguity is solved by using a context-based prefer-
ence order learnt from a large annotated corpus.
This approach works with a caveat: embedding
domain content like stay duration in dialogue act
types may cause an explosion of categories for
less restricted domains and, while easily recognis-
able, such tailored categories are domain specific.
Therefore, they are not reusable when creating an
application for a new domain.
2.3 Detection Trade-Off
In short, we argue that statistical methods of di-
alogue act detection do not scale. This approach
always leads to a trade-off between suboptimal
inter-annotator agreement as in DAMSL or lack
of reusability as in Verbmobil.
The reason for this trade-off is that two issues
of different natures are tackled at the same time:
semantics and pragmatics. The lack of a strati-
fied linguistic theory with semantic and pragmatic
steps behind these classifications is the cause of a
bad fit between categories and grammatical struc-
ture in the case of DAMSL. This shortcoming can
be partially overcome through the usage of tai-
lored categories at the expense of large annotated
training corpora and a low reusability.
Tailoring is particularly expensive when experi-
mental data is not easily obtainable as for human-
wheelchair interaction. Therefore we need a dif-
ferent approach that separates text analysis from
utterance contextualisation (see Section 4).
3 Belief-Desire-Intention Approach
The formal theory of rational interaction (FTRI)
is a plan-based approach to dialogue management
that divides user mental representations into be-
liefs, desires and intentions (BDI). The dialogue
manager keeps track of which planned tasks are
feasible for, assigned to and/or completed by par-
ticular agents (Sadek, 1992; Sadek, 1994; Sadek
et al, 1996; Sadek et al, 1997). Logical infer-
ences are made with respect to interactant?s mental
states in order to plan the next verbal action of the
dialogue system. The interpersonal features of the
linguistic model are very simple. User utterances
are classified into one of 3 categories of syntactic
patterns (directive, interrogative, or affirmative),
295
and are used in combination with spotted verbs in
order to determine the beliefs, desires, and inten-
tions of the user. Lists of implications are used
in order to infer actions from certain combinations
of intentions and beliefs. An example for such an
implication is: If a user u intends (I) to have an
action a DONE, u intends (I) her/his utterance to
have the same rational effect RE as performing a
by her/himself; in other words, by informing the
system about her or his intention to have a task
performed, the user delegates the performance of
this task to the system. The formal theory of ratio-
nal interaction along with similar theories have re-
ceived strong criticism. They lack a formalization
of linguistic meaning (structural meaning) capable
of encapsulating the richness and flexibility of lin-
guistic systems. Moreover, ?[BDI p]lan-based ap-
proaches [to dialogue management] are also criti-
cised as being more opaque, especially given the
large amount of procedural processing and lack
of a well-founded semantics for plan-related op-
erations? (Traum et al, 1999). Improving upon
BDI plan-based approaches, Traum?s work takes
into account dialogue acts (Traum and Hinkelman,
1992) and obligations (Traum and Allen, 1994).
Reflecting Traum et al?s critique of the BDI ap-
proach, the present work can be understood as
a step towards the theoretical conceptualization
of some of BDI?s opaque operations within an
information-state approach to dialogue manage-
ment.
4 Contract-Supported Interaction
Our work is supported by automatic functional
text analysis (parsing) with Combinatory Catego-
rial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman and Baldridge,
2011) using Systemic Functional Theory (Hall-
iday and Matthiessen, 2004). This enables us
to detect personal stances and attitude automati-
cally in the syntactic structure of the utterance (see
Section 4.1). Based on these detected concepts,
we generate a standardised typed feature struc-
ture, which captures the commonalities of differ-
ent utterance types with respect to the implied ex-
pectations from the addressee. Rather than hy-
pothesizing about the user?s mental states, we are
able to base our interpretation solely on what is
linguistically expressed as required from the ad-
dressee. Our usage of inference is somewhat sim-
ilar to the one proposed by FTRI; however, with
the formalised concept of tacit contracts?further
formalizing the update operations in the dialogue
system of Matheson et al (2000)., we gain situ-
ational flexibility which is of great value, because
tacit contracts are not universally valid, but depend
on the roles of the interactants in a given situation.
4.1 Interpersonal Upper Model
On the semantic level, we adopt the most compre-
hensive linguistic description of the interpersonal
component of human languages, which is found
in the Systemic Functional Grammar of English
(Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004). We created an
ontology of linguistic units, the Interpersonal Up-
per Model, covering all interpersonal features of
Systemic Functional Theory with minor adjust-
ments and extensions. Using this classification of
linguistic units, we implemented a Combinatory
Categorial Grammar for German to parse a cor-
pus collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment where
users gave commands to an intelligent wheelchair
in order to perform simple domestic tasks like
washing their hands or opening the door (Anasta-
siou et al, 2012; Vale and Mast, 2012b; Vale and
Mast, 2012a).
For an intelligent wheelchair to understand the
utterances of the user, first it must cope with the
various ways in which interpersonal meaning is
expressed in language. For example, by utter-
ing either of the clauses ?I want you to leave.?
or ?Leave!?, the speaker commands the addressee
to perform the action of leaving. Although they
share this interpersonal function, the first makes
the command explicit by referring to the requirer
and performer of the service while the second
leaves it implicit in the structure of the clause.
Halliday and Matthiessen (2004) call such ex-
pression pairs, where different wordings represent
the same interpersonal meaning, interpersonally
agnate expressions. In their work, grammatical
metaphor is defined as the process whereby con-
cepts which are usually implicit in the structure of
clauses are re-expressed with more explicit refer-
ential representations.
It must be noted that this analysis relies strictly
on utterance semantics, i.e. the information that
can be gained from automatically analyzing the
utterance alone, without relying on linguistic or
situational context. By relying on parsing rather
than string-level methods such as POS-tagging,
keyword spotting and statistical utterance classi-
fication, we have the advantage of retaining the
296
rich information contained in the structure of the
utterance. For our approach, we rely on pars-
ing with Categorial Combinatory Grammar (CCG)
(Steedman and Baldridge, 2011) based on Sys-
temic Functional Theory. This methodology pro-
vides us with a systematic, theory-based way of
retrieving features of the linguistic structure of an
utterance that are relevant for human-computer in-
teraction. When parsing with a functional gram-
mar, syntactic units are classified according to
their function. Therefore, the segmentation of the
utterance into constituents is based on the compo-
sitionality of semantic units.
In the remainder of this section, we will explain
in detail the two main characters of interpersonal
meaning, attitude and stance and how they are
recognised in linguistic structure. In the follow-
ing section, we will proceed to demonstrate how
we turn the concept of grammatical metaphors into
a method for representing interpersonal linguistic
features explicitly in a standardised manner.
4.1.1 Attitude
Attitudes (or direct speech acts) specify the kind of
thing negotiated: a mercative attitude indicates an
exchange of goods (?A beer, please!?), an impera-
tive attitude an exchange of services (?Please take
me to the kitchen!?), and a declarative attitude an
exchange of information (?Is the door closed??).
They also specify the orientation of the exchange
between the interactants: whether the speaker is
offering something to the addressee (?Your beer!?
? offertive attitude) or demanding something from
them (?A beer please!? ? mandative).
By classifying attitudes in these two dimen-
sions, we have a clear separation of exchange ori-
entation (speaker to addressee or vice-versa) and
exchange stock (good, service, or information).
The combination of these options yielding six dif-
ferent attitudes1, as shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Orientation ? Stock? Attitude
Orientation ? Stock Attitude
demand info mandative ? declarative interrogative
offer info offertive ? declarative affirmative
demand service mandative ? imperative directive
offer service offertive ? imperative preemptive
demand good mandative ? mercative questive
offer good offertive ? mercative donative
1The full ontology contains more distinctions that are ig-
nored here for the sake of brevity.
As Example (1) shows, a mercative attitude (ex-
change of goods) is usually expressed by noun
groups with modifiers such as ?please?. There is
no constituent for Process nor Subject. Impera-
tive attitudes (exchange of services) are usually
expressed by predicates, that is, they have no Sub-
ject constituent as shown in Example (2). Finally,
declarative attitudes (exchange of information) are
usually expressed by full predications 2, as in Ex-
amples (3) and (4).
(1) ?A beer, please!? (mercative)
(2) ?Please take me to the kitchen!? (imperative)
(3) ?The door is closed.? (declarative)
(4) ?Is the door closed?? (declarative)
Because there is a mapping between the syntactic
level of an utterance structure and the kind of stock
being exchanged (goods, services or information),
we can automatically detect which attitude each
utterance has.
4.1.2 Stance
Stance (or modality) ?construe[s] the region of
cognitive uncertainty that lies between ?yes? and
?no?? (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004). There are
two primary kinds of stance: control determines
whether someone wants something (inclination,
e.g. ?is keen to?, ?wants?) or is wanted for some-
thing (regulation, e.g. ?is supposed to?, ?must?),
and conviction determines how likely something
is (likelihood, e.g. ?it?s likely to rain?, ?it?s def-
initely not going to rain?), or how often it occurs
(usuality, e.g. ?It often rains in summer.?, ?it never
rains in the desert.?). Because Systemic Func-
tional Theory works by delimiting semantically
classified syntactic units based on possible seman-
tic oppositions, combinatory categorial parsing of
expressions is straight forward.
4.2 Grammatical Metaphor
As discussed in the previous section, attitude has
an orientation from the speaker to the addressee
or vice versa (offering or demanding). The ser-
vice requirer and/or provider are not explicitly
mentioned, but determined by the syntactic struc-
ture used and the roles of the interactants in the
dialogue, speaker and addressee. Halliday and
Matthiessen (2004) call this interpersonal orien-
tation . Stance provides a linguistic tool to explic-
itly express the source and target of orientation,
detaching them from the interactional situation.
2i.e. association between a subject and a predicate
297
For instance, ?Leave!? is a service demand with
an interpersonal orientation from the addressee to
the speaker. If one rephrases this with ?must? as
in ?you must leave.? or ?he must leave.?, one ob-
tains a personal stance, that is, an orientation from
the speaker to the provider of the service which is
explicitly expressed by a reference such as ?you?
or ?he?. By rephrasing the utterance again with
?require? as in ?you are required by me? or ?you
are required by law?, one obtains an impersonal
stance, that is, both requirer and service performer
are referred to explicitly and not assumed from the
orientation of the linguistic exchange.
It is possible to express the same interpersonal
meaning with an impersonal orientation as with an
interpersonal orientation. For example, ?You are
required by me to leave.?, just like ?Leave!?, takes
the speaker as the requirer and the addressee as the
performer of the required action of leaving, there-
fore these two expressions are agnate, making the
first a grammatical metaphor of the second.
Table 2: Possible orientations.
Interpers. Personal Impersonal
leave you must leave you are required by me to leave
he must leave he is required by me to leave
you are required by law to leave
he is required by law to leave
4.2.1 Addressee-centered perspective
Each attitude brings about a required response
from the addressee: offertive attitudes, by offer-
ing a stock, pose a requirement to receive this
stock and mandative attitudes, by demanding a
stock, pose a requirement to give one. These re-
quired responses can be expressed explicitly in
more metaphorical agnate expressions. For ex-
ample, the attitude of offering goods (offertive
? mercative ? donative) is represented by the
process ?take? in agnate expressions with the ad-
dressee as the subject as in ?Take some cookies.?.
Table 3 shows the mapping of all 6 main attitudes
onto their corresponding requirements from the
addressee.
With mappings from the less metaphorical
expressions to more metaphorical ones, the
wheelchair can construe a standardised semantic
representation to work with. This explicitation
method enables us to capture the semantic com-
monalities of a broad variety of different linguis-
tic expressions. Examples (5) and (6) show two
different utterances whose standardised represen-

from the addressee

questive give goods hand
preemptive receive services assign
directive give services perform

interrogative give information say
tations are highly similar. Example (5) is an in-
formation offer, re-expressed as a requirement to
know a given information. Agnately, Example (6)
is a service demand, re-expressed as a requirement
to perform the service of being aware of the same
information, a particular way of knowing it3.
(5) ?it?s snowing?
LINGUISTIC MEANING:
Speaker offers to Addressee information that
it?s snowing
ADDRESSEE-CENTERED MEANING:
Speaker requires Addressee
to know that
it?s snowing
(6) ?be aware that it?s snowing?
LINGUISTIC MEANING:
Speaker demands from Addressee service
of being aware that
it?s snowing
ADDRESSEE-CENTERED MEANING:
Speaker requires Addressee
to perform
being aware that
it?s snowing
Speaker requires Addressee
to be aware that
it?s snowing
The standardised semantic representation has the
advantage that the wheelchair needs to treat re-
quirements in only the most explicit representation
when deciding which action it is expected to per-
form. In the following section, we will explain the
concept of tacit contracts, and how they are used
by our interpersonal calculus in order to extract
the dialogue act from the user utterance as repre-
sented by the addressee-centered semantic repre-
sentation and the situation model.
4.3 Tacit Contracts
While the addressee-centered semantic treatment
enables an intelligent wheelchair to deal with ut-
terances such as (7) and the more metaphorical (8)
in a standardised manner independent of the situ-
ation, there is a further step of processing needed
3As performing an action is the same as acting, in Exam-
ple (6), ?requiring to perform being aware? can be simplified
to ?requiring to be aware?.
298
in order to deal with the full scope of utterances
collected in our usability experiment.
(7) ?Take me to the kitchen.?
(8) ?I want you to take me to the kitchen.?
(9) ?I must go to the kitchen.?
For instance, the wheelchair needs to understand
that utterance (9) is, in the dialogue situation, not
only an offering of information of a need of the
user, but a more polite variant to Examples (7)
and (8) (Vale and Mast, 2012a). The meaning
the speaker intends to convey goes beyond what
is said. Grice (1975) called this kind of pragmatic
inference conversational implicature. They arise
from the the understanding of a set of conversa-
tional maxims which humans can be expected to
observe in conversation in combination with fea-
tures of the interactional situation in which it is ut-
tered. In contrast, conventional implicatures arise
from the meaning of the uttered sentence and the
maxims of communication, without any influence
from the interactional situation. Re?canati (1991)
improved the Gricean model of maxims, but for
theoretical reasons accepted no linguistic formal-
ism, which makes his model impossible to apply
in intelligent wheelchair design.
Relevance Theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1995;
Carston, 1998) further develops the concept of in-
ference in a cognitive paradigm by replacing max-
ims of communication with a balance between the
cognitive effort needed to make an inference and
its positive cognitive effect under the principle of
relevance. Like Re?canati, they establish the lin-
guistic meaning as the boundary between seman-
tics and pragmatics and divide the inferential pro-
cess into the two subprocesses enrichment (result-
ing in the explicatum) and deduction (resulting in
the implicatum).
As the main aim of this theory is to explain hu-
man cognition and not to design artificial intelli-
gence, it is not directly translatable into a method
for automation in applied robotics. One prob-
lem for automation is the assumption that inter-
actants access and use all kinds of information, as
needed. The inherently open nature of this theory
makes its operationalization as a general frame-
work impossible. In addition, assessing the rele-
vance and cognitive effort of every item of infor-
mation and process of reasoning makes it compu-
tationally too complex for practical applications.
Moreover, Relevance Theory is not backed by a
grammatical theory, and therefore lacks a com-
prehensive set of interpersonal linguistic features
such as attitudes and stances.
In our approach, we follow the principle of sep-
arating meaning into linguistic meaning, explica-
tum, and implicatum, as proposed by Relevance
Theory. Instead of the general effort-effect bal-
ance, we propose the concept of tacit contracts
which operate on the pragmatic deduction step of
communication in the Relevance Theory frame-
work. Tacit contracts also differ from Grice?s sys-
tem of conversational maxims, which is not spe-
cific enough to distinguish which inferences are
expected from particular individuals in their cur-
rent functional roles.
Rather than general maxims of communication,
tacit contracts are specific agreements entered into
by two or more parties that establish obligations
between those parties. These contracts determine
the services that a party is required to perform
in given situations. Therefore they determine the
services that the speaker can expect from the ad-
dressee when he or she causes these situations to
happen. For example, a contract such as ?your
wish is my command? only applies to interactants
occupying a given role in the interaction, such as
caregiver, waiter, etc., and only for a given set of
actions that correspond to this role. If Karl is sit-
ting in a cafe? and says to the waiter ?I would like
steak for the main course.?, the waiter would treat
this wish as a command to serve the desired food,
because bringing food is part of his tacit contract
as a waiter. If Karl were to state ?I would like to
have your hat.?, the waiter would not consider this
a command, but a statement, because, although he
would be capable to do so, providing the hat is not
part of his contract as a waiter.
Politeness, in this perspective, is a manner of
obtaining a stock whereby a speaker replaces his
or her requirement for an addressee to give out a
stock with an exchange of information about the
current situation. The new information triggers
a tacit contract which then enables the addressee
to infer the contractual requirement for the current
situation in a separate step of deduction.
4.3.1 Interactional Situation
For inferring implicata it is also important to dif-
ferentiate two types of businesses: stocks and is-
sues. For instance, in the afore-mentioned table-
attending situation, let?s suppose Karl had said
the same utterance to his friend Hanna ?I would
299
like steak for the main course. Because Hanna
cannot give a steak to Karl, the business of this
interaction, providing a steak, is an issue and
not a stock?they cannot exchange it, but only
talk about it. The difference to the hat example
above is that the waiter can provide his hat, but is
not required to do so by any applicable contract,
whereas Hanna may want to provide the steak, but
is not able to4.
By classifying businesses into stocks and issues,
it is possible to trim down the inferential process
further to avoid undesired implicatures. For in-
stance, a wheelchair should treat the following two
utterances differently: 1. ?I would like to go to the
kitchen? and 2. ?I would like to open the door?.
Taking someone to the kitchen is a stock in this
interaction?a service that the wheelchair can per-
form and that the user can assign to it. Opening the
door, on the other hand, is not in the range of the
wheelchair?s capabilities and therefore an issue.
In the following subsection, we will explain
how contracts and business kinds are used in the
inferential calculus for generating an implicatum
out of the explicatum. Then we will proceed to
present the specific contracts relevant for the in-
teraction with an intelligent wheelchair.
4.3.2 Contractual Calculus
Reference resolution and all other situational at-
tachments of meaning are dealt with in the en-
riching step of the inferential process. Example
(10) shows the enrichment of an utterance in the
wheelchair scenario.
(10)?I would like to go to the kitchen?
ADDRESSEE-CENTERED MEANING:
Speaker requires Addressee
to know that
Speaker would like
to go to the kitchen
EXPLICATUM:
JOHN requires ROLLAND
to know that
JOHN is keen
to go to KITCHEN#1
After enrichment, the contractual phase is entered.
Contracts may be triggered by a requirement to-
wards the wheelchair to say or know. This is then
re-interpreted as a polite requirement to give or re-
ceive goods, services, or information depending
on the contract.
The process for selecting applicable tacit con-
tracts is the following: once a declarative re-
quirement has been detected, the system checks
4Notice that this reasoning constraint is similar to the Fea-
sibility predicate of FTRI.
Table 4: Surrogation
User: ?I need to go to the kitchen.?

Subject Finite ? ? ?
Actor ? Process Action-Goal Destination
Agent ? ? Medium ?
whether the speaker is the requirer and the ad-
dressee the provider of the impersonal stance.
If so, for each known contract, it is determined
whether the contract applies for the given requirer
and provider in their current functional roles. For
each applicable contract, the contract script is per-
formed, as will be shown in the following section.
4.3.3 Wheelchair Contracts
Here we present the contracts needed for un-
derstanding the utterances that occurred in our
wheelchair-usage corpus. All user utterances in
the corpus, except for three cases, can be under-
stood appropriately with the given contracts.
Surrogation is the contract whereby a statement
by the speaker of their inclination or obligation to
perform an action is interpreted as a demand of
a service. For example, if the user puts a bottle
on the intelligent wheelchair and tells it ?I need to
take this bottle to Hannah?, the wheelchair should
treat this as a command to take the bottle to Han-
nah, assuming she is close by (similar to the im-
plication in FTRI discussed in section 3).
For a non-affecting action such as ?going?, the
entity that undergoes change as a result of the ac-
tion (the Medium) is the Actor. In an affecting ac-
tion such as ?put?, on the other hand, the Medium
is the Action-Goal or action target?the thing be-
ing put. If a person states that they need to per-
form an action, the wheelchair needs to perform
a service in which it is the Actor and which im-
poses the same result on the Medium. As Table
4 shows, this entails substituting a non-affecting
action (?go?) with an affecting action (?take?).
Example (11) shows the performance of a con-
tractual implicature in the deductive process.
(11)?I need to go to the kitchen?
EXPLICATUM:
JOHN requires ROLLAND
to know that
300
JOHN is required
to go to the kitchen
IMPLICATUM:

Supply is a contract whereby requiring X to say
whether X will do should be interpreted as requir-
ing X to do.
Need gleaning is a contract whereby the ad-
dressee is required to interpret a question about the
availability of a stock as a statement of its need by
the speaker. This contract is used together with
Surrogation to create polite commands. Example
(12) shows the inference of first applying the con-
tract need gleaning, interpreting a requiring X to
say whether X can do Y as a requiring X to know
that Y needs to be done, and then applying the con-
tract surrogation, as described above.
(12)?Can you take me to the kitchen??
EXPLICATUM:
JOHN requires ROLLAND
to say whether
ROLLAND can
take JOHN to the kitchen
IMPLICATUM: NEED GLEANING
JOHN politely requires ROLLAND
to know that
JOHN needs
to be taken to the kitchen
IMPLICATUM: SURROGATION
JOHN requires ROLLAND very politely
to take JOHN to the kitchen
Support is a contract whereby the statement of
the speaker?s inclination or obligation to perform
an action is understood as a command to offer the
stock that serves to fulfill the preconditions for
performing his or her intended or required action.
As Example (13) shows, requiring X to know that
Y is keen to is interpreted as requiring X to perform
an action that enables Y to.
(13)?I?d like to open the door!?
EXPLICATUM:
JOHN requires ROLLAND
to know that
JOHN is keen
to open the door
IMPLICATUM: SUPPORT
JOHN politely requires ROLLAND
to take JOHN to a place
where JOHN can open the door
This contract is dependent on the classification of
entities by affordances and usage preconditions. A
wheelchair can only decide where to take the user
who says ?I would like to do a mouth wash?, if it
knows that doing a mouth wash requires the user
to be at a certain position in front of a wash basin.
In addition, in order to distinguish whether to
apply the contract support or the contract surro-
gate, the distinction between stock and issue is
central. If the desired action of the speaker is a
stock, i.e. a service that can be performed by the
wheelchair, the contract surrogate should be ap-
plied. If it is an issue, the contract support should
be applied instead.
5 Discussion and Outlook
We have presented the main linguistic features of
our Enactment Upper Model and shown how to in-
fer dialogue acts by using tacit contracts. With this
procedure, we are able to determine automatically
which actions the wheelchair is expected to do for
most utterances of our corpus. From a theoretical
point of view, we proposed a method of deducing
implicata by applying contractual scripts that com-
bine a linguistic and a philosophical approach with
the strict purpose of automation and, in specific,
of controlling an intelligent wheelchair. In doing
so, we fill the gap between a linguist?s set of lexi-
cogrammatical features with requiring force and a
philosopher?s set of axioms from which it can be
deduced whether the user made a request.
On a robot design perspective, we have spared
the text analysis component from creating specific
speech acts for a number of clause structures such
as ?can you...? and ?will you...? and so on, which
would otherwise be necessary, and spared the dia-
logue manager from managing a large number of
user?s dialogue-related intentions and from deal-
ing with the otherwise present ambiguity of con-
textually interpretable utterances such as ?I need
to open the door?. In addition, our approach en-
ables adjustment for new wheelchair functionality
without rewriting the whole text analysis compo-
nent and allows for an easy addition of new tacit
contracts with corresponding scripts.
The approach presented in this paper provides a
principled way for inferring dialogue acts that uses
the structural information present in the clause and
therefore enables high accuracy and reusability
both on the semantic and on the pragmatic level.
In order to gain a full understanding of the scala-
bility of this approach, further investigation of ap-
plicable contracts in different application domains
is necessary.
