Abstract
This article presents an original lexical
unit extraction system for Chinese. The
method is based on an incremental pro-
cess driven by an association score featur-
ing a minimal resources statistically aided
linguistic approach. We also introduce
a linguistics-based lexical unit definition
and use it to describe an evaluation pro-
tocol dedicated to the task. The experi-
mental results on a domain specific cor-
pus show that the method performs better
than other approaches. The extraction re-
sults, evaluated on a random sample of the
working corpus, show a recall of 68.4 %
and precision of 37.1 %.
1 Introduction
Lexical resources are all the more fundamental to
NLP systems since domain specific corpora are
multiple and various. The performance of com-
mon tasks, such as Information Retrieval or In-
formation Extraction, can be improved by com-
prehensive and updated domain specific lexicon
(i.e. terminology). However the constitution of
lexicons raises pragmatic issues, such as develop-
ment cost or re-usability, which have a great im-
portance in an industrial context ; and also theoret-
ical issues, such as the definition of the lexical unit
or evaluation protocol, which are crucial for the
relevance of the results. In Chinese text process-
ing context, lexicons are particularly important for
dictionary-based word segmentation techniques in
which out-of-vocabulary words are an important
cause of errors (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
In this paper we consider the lexicon extraction
task independent of the word segmentation, this
position differs from Zhao and Kit?s (2004) point
of view. Generally speaking, word segmentation
aims at delimiting units in a sequence of charac-
ters. The delimited units are usually morpholog-
ical lexical units (i.e. words) and internal com-
position of the unit is not considered. The eval-
uation process checks whether each word occur-
rence is well delimited. On the opposite, lexicon
extraction aims at extracting lexicon entries from
a corpus. The extracted units are morphological
or syntactic units and the internal components are
also considered. The evaluation process checks
the extracted candidates list considering the cor-
pus global scope.
Many approaches for Chinese lexicon extrac-
tion rely on a supervised word segmenter (Wu and
Jiang, 2003; Li et al, 2004) or a morpho-syntactic
tagger (Piao et al, 2006) to extract unknown
words. These techniques perform well but suffer
from a major drawback, they cannot be applied
efficiently to corpora that cover different domains
than the calibration corpus. Some approaches are
nested in an unsupervised word segmentation pro-
cess and aim at improving its effectiveness. Fung
and Wu (1994) try to select segments using mu-
tual information on bigram. Chang and Su (1997)
present an iterative unsupervised lexicon extrac-
tion system driven by the quality of segmentation
obtained with the discovered lexicon. This ap-
proach, although efficient, imposes an arbitrarily
4-character length restriction on candidates. Other
works, like this approach, focus on the lexicon or
terminology extraction as standalone task. Feng et
al. (2004) introduce a lexicon extraction unsuper-
963
vised method based on context variation with very
convincing results. Yang et al (2008) focus on
terminology extraction using delimiters extracted
from a training corpus with good results.
This study proposes an original answer to the
Chinese lexicon extraction task using an incre-
mental minimal resources method to extract and
rank lexical unit candidates. An annotated refer-
ence corpus is required to extract a common-word
dictionary and to prepare the data. The method
has the advantage of proposing structured candi-
dates, which allow interactive candidate filtering.
In addition the candidate maximum length is de-
termined by the number of associations that allow
the detection of the longer lexical units. We ex-
tend the association measure method introduced
by Sun et al (1998) for word segmentation with-
out lexical resources. This paper starts with a lin-
guistic definition of the lexical unit which drives
the method. We also build on it to propose an im-
provement of the evaluation protocol for the Chi-
nese lexicon extraction task.
2 Lexical Unit Definition
Although defining the Chinese lexical unit is not
a trivial task, we think that it is absolutely neces-
sary for the understanding of the kind of linguis-
tic phenomena we are dealing with. Without this
knowledge we may miss important features and
may not be able to efficiently evaluate the extrac-
tion process. We introduce two linguistic concepts
to define the lexical units focusing on contempo-
rary written Chinese: the morpho-syntactic unit
and the lexical content. These definitions use con-
cepts introduced by Polgue`re (2003) applied to the
Chinese case by Nguyen (2008).
2.1 Morpho-syntactic Unit
A graphy is the Chinese minimal autonomous or-
thographic unit and it approximatively matches
the glyph concept in computer science. The fol-
lowing glyphs are different Chinese graphies: ?,
?, ?, ?, ?. A morph (noted |m |) is the small-
est meaningful unit representable by a sequence of
graphies. Morphs are atomic so that they cannot
be representable by a smaller sequence of morphs.
The following sequences of graphies are different
morphs : |longevity? |, | grape??|, | aspirin????|, | buy? |. Note that
the graphy ? does not carry any meaning and is
not a morph. A morpheme (noted ||M||1) is a set of
morphs sharing the same lexical content ignoring
grammatical inflection or variants (Table 1). Chi-
nese morphs cannot be inflected, unlike European
languages, but some graphies have variants.
Morpheme Morph
||protect? || |protect? |
|| aspirin???? || | aspirin???? |
|| cat? || | cat? | | cat? |
Table 1: Morphemes and related morphs
A word-form (noted ( w )) is an autonomous
and inseparable sequence of morphs. Autonomy
means that it can be enunciated individually and
can take place in a syntactic paradigm. Insepa-
rability means that breaking the sequence causes
the loss of the relationship between elements. A
lexeme (noted ( W) ) is a set of word-forms shar-
ing the same lexical content ignoring inflection or
variants (Table 2).
Lexeme Word-form
( aspirin????) ( aspirin|????| )
( take? ) ( take|?|) ( take /prefect/|?|?|) ( take /progressive/|?|?| ) ( take /experience/|?|?| )
( insurance?? ) ( insurance|?|?|)
( panda|?|?|) ( panda|?|?|) ( panda|?|?|)
Table 2: Lexemes and associated word-forms
A phrase (noted [ s ]) is a syntactic combina-
tion of word-forms. The syntactic nature of the
combination implies that the phrase components
are relatively free. A locution (noted [[ S ]]) is a
set of lexicalized phrases sharing the same lexical
content ignoring inflection or variants (Table 3).
Locution Phrase
[[ shoot?? ]] [ shoot(?)(?)] [ shoot /prefect/(??)(?) ] ...
[[ be jealous?? ]] [ be jealous(?)(?)]
[[ insurance company????]] [ insurance company(??)(??) ]
Table 3: Locutions and associated phrases
1The standard simplified form is used to represent mor-
phemes.
964
The morphs, word-forms and phrases are the
morpho-syntactic units, they describe the compo-
sition of lexemes and locutions.
2.2 Lexical Content
The lexical units we look for are lexemes and lo-
cutions. Finding lexical units means identifying
words-forms and phrases having a lexical content.
We use two criteria to define the lexical content:
the compositionality criterion and the referential-
ity criterion (Table 4). Units which fulfill at least
one of these criteria are said to have a lexical con-
tent.
The compositionality criterion (or lexicaliza-
tion criterion) is relative to the relationship be-
tween the sense of the unit and the sense of its
components. The question is whether or not the
sense of the unit can be deduced from the combi-
nation of its components. The referentiality crite-
rion is related to the relationship between the unit
and the referent concept or object. The question is
whether or not the referent has specific properties
for the speakers. This criterion is strongly depen-
dent on human judgment and the working domain.
Referential No-Referential
Compositional (Chinese food?? ) ( anticization???)
[[ insurance company???? ]] [ African car???? ]
Lexicalized ( disinfect??) [[ everyone?? ]]
[[ dividend product???? ]] [[ selling vinegar as wine??????]]
Table 4: Referential and Compositional units
The Table 4 presents examples of four criterion
combinations. Referentiality and compositional-
ity criteria are always applied at the highest as-
sociation level, thus [[ insurance company???? ]]) is compositional,
although ( insurance??) and ( company??) are not compositional.
Word-forms are not necessarily compositional or
referential, thus the unit ( anticization???) does not refer to
any concept and we can use the combination of its
components to interpret it: ( antiquity?? ) + || -ation? ||. Ref-
erentiality does not imply lexicalization, thus the
compositional unit [[ German car???? ]] is referential be-
cause it refers to the German car brands or char-
acteristics in the automobile context.

3 Methodology
The method (Figure 1) follows the linguistic in-
tuitions developed in the previous section. We
identify morpho-syntactic units and select those
that are likely to have a lexical content to obtain
lexical unit candidates (LUCs). The word-forms
and phrases are respectively generated by associ-
ations of morphs or word-forms and association
of word-forms or phrases. We consequently use
an incremental process, which associates LUCs
as they are selected. The incremental process is
initiated by detecting every morph and spliting
the corpus into segments. Then we enumerate all
the morpho-syntactic unit couples and use lexical
content criteria to select the couples to associate.
This process is repeated until the maximum num-
ber of associations is reached. At the end, the
LUCs are reorganized and submitted to the user.
The user?s answers are used to filter the remaining
LUCs.
3.1 Morphs Detection
As stated in Section 2.1, we consider that the
morph is the minimal morpho-syntactic unit. Ev-
ery glyph is considered as a morph unless it
can be included in an ancient loanword morph
(( butterfly??) ( garbage?? ) ) or a foreign transcription morph
(( Italy???) , ( microphone???) ). In an ambiguous case the
longest possibility is accepted. Foreign transcrip-
tions are phonetic interpretations of foreign words
using the pronunciation of the Chinese graphies.
The set of graphies used for transcription is well-
965
known and closed. We trained a CRF tagger2
using simple features based on current, next and
previous graphies to extract foreign transcriptions
(the training corpus is described in Section 4.1).
Ancient loanwords importation process is not pro-
ductive anymore, thus they are detected using a
loanword list.
3.2 Segment Detection
The aim of the segment detection step is to split
the corpus into segments (i.e. a succession of
Chinese graphies). Chinese texts contain two
kinds of delimiters which are not likely to be
components of a lexical unit, delimiter-words and
delimiter-expressions. Delimiter-words are enu-
merable with a common word dictionary3 and
include prepositions (?, ?), adverbs (?, ?,
?), pronouns (?, ??, ??), interrogative
pronouns (??, ?), conjunctions (??, ?,
??), discourse structure words (??, ??,
?), tonal particles (?, ?) and tool-words (?).
Delimiter-expressions include numerical expres-
sions (????, ??), temporal expressions
(????, ????), circumstantial expres-
sions (?...??, ?...?) , which are easily de-
scribable using shallow context-free grammars.
Delimiters are removed from the corpus and used
to delimit the segments. The inflexions (?, ?,
?), which introduce inflectional variations, are
also removed from the corpus but do not delimit
the segments. The delimiters identification is con-
trolled by rules. For instance tonal particles are
removed only if they are the end of a segment, dis-
course structure words are removed only if they
are the beginning of a segment. Delimiters and
inflexions are not removed if they are inside a se-
quence of graphies which is present in a common-
word dictionary.
3.3 Selection of Lexical Unit Candidates
In this step, lexical unit candidates (LUCs) are
extracted by selecting morpho-syntactic unit cou-
ples, which are likely to have a lexical content.
The first assumption is that lexical units can al-
ways be decomposed into binary trees. Only a
small number of lexical units do not satisfy this
2CRF++ implementation of Conditional Random Fields
3We assert that this kind of dictionary is easily available
Sentence with delimiters noted {delimiter}:

[????] [??] [??] [?] [???]
Figure 2: Segment detection example
assumption (e.g. ????), in such case it is
possible to select a non-linguistically motivated
way to decompose the unit into binary associa-
tions. Thus, every couples of contiguous morpho-
syntactic units are iteratively enumerated for each
segment. The second assumption is that asso-
ciation measures are good statistical evidence to
detect lexical content. Thereby, the association
strength of morpho-syntactic couples is used as a
main criterion to identify relevant candidates.
Consider G the alphabet of all Chinese gra-
phies, M = G+ the language describing the
morpho-syntactic units, Sn a set of segments at
step n, sin = m1,m2, ...,mn the ith segment of
Sn where ?m ? sin | m ? M and S?n the set
of all morpho-syntactic unit couples in Sn seg-
ments. Given the morpho-syntactic unit couple
mi, mi+1 ? S?n (denoted as mi,i+1), the lexical con-
tent criteria (LCC(mi,i+1)) matches if the follow-
ing conditions are fulfilled:
1. Neither mi nor mi+1 has not been associated
at the current step n.
2. Nb(mi) 6= 1 or Nb(mi+1) 6= 1.
3. AS(mi,i+1) > T .
4. AS(mi,i+1) > AS(mi?1,i)
or not LCC(mi?1,i)
5. AS(mi,i+1) > AS(mi+1,i+2)
or not LCC(mi+1,i+2)
where Nb(x) is the number of occurrences of x,
AS(x, y) returns the association score of the cou-
966
ple x, y computed with a given association mea-
sure, and T is the association threshold relative to
the association measure (cf. 4.1).
Let S0 the initial set of segments where ?si0 ? S0,
si0 is a segment (cf. 3.2) such that ?m ? si0, m is
a morph (cf. 3.1). The LUC list is composed of
morpho-syntactic couples produced by the asso-
ciation operator ? to compute Smax (algorithm 1)
with max the maximum number of iteration.
S ? Sn?1
while ?mi,i+1 ? S?| LCC(mi,i+1)
S ? S[mi ?mi+1]
end
Sn ? S
(1)
with ? the association operator whose result is a
morpho-syntactic unit, Sn[m1 ?m2] the replace-
ment of m1 and m2 by the morpho-syntactic unit
m1 ?m2 in the corresponding segment. See the
Section 5 for more details about the maximum
number of iteration setting.
3.4 Candidates Reorganization
Once LUCs are extracted, we map every LUC to
the couple of morpho-syntactic units it is com-
posed of. These units are called components.
Some LUCs are generated from two different cou-
ples at the candidate selection step. For instance,
???? is discovered in two ways: ?????
or ?????. We always choose the most fre-
quent option. When the ?LUC/couple? map is
created, we sort the LUCs by their correspond-
ing couple association scores. Finally, if a LUC is
ranked in the list before its components we move
the components to the position just before it in
the list and use the same rule to recursively check
the moved components. The candidates list is ex-
pected to be ordered by likelihood deduced by an
association measure and compositional order.
3.5 Presentation and User Interaction
The lexicon extraction task aims at submitting a
ranked list of candidates to the user in order to
help him produce lexical resources. The user is
expected to check the list in this order and the
method uses the user answers to discard not yet
verified candidates. To do so, the user is asked
to answer the following questions for each LUC
according to the definition given in the Section 2:
1. Does the unit have a lexical content ?
2. Is the unit a part of a lexical unit ?
If answers to both these questions are ?no? then
all the candidates having this component are re-
moved from the remaining list.
4 Evaluation
Since the submitted candidates are progressively
modified according to the user answers, the eval-
uated candidates are only the ones submitted to
the user. We used three measures to evaluate the
method: recall, precision and precision at rank n.
Since producing large annotated corpora is costly,
we perform the evaluation using a sample of texts
from the evaluation corpus. Therefore the scores
obtained are an estimation of the true scores. The
inter-human variation is not considered here and
should be integrated in further works.
4.1 Evaluation parameters
The morphs and the segment detection step use
data from a reference corpus: The Lancaster Cor-
pus of Mandarin Chinese (McEnery and Xiao,
2004). The corpus is composed of text samples
choose in various domain and genre corpora, it
contains two millions of glyphs and it is anno-
tated according to the Beijing University anno-
tation guideline4. This corpus is mainly used
to extract delimiter-words, to produce the gram-
mar for delimiter-expressions and to extract a
common-word dictionary. All foreign transcrip-
tions are also annotated for the CRF tagger train-
ing (cf. 3.1).
The lexical unit detection step is evaluated us-
ing four well-known association measures: Point-
wise Mutual Information (PMI), Poisson-Striling
(PS) (Quasthoff and Wolff, 2002), Log-likelihood
(LL), Pointwise Mutual Information Cube (PMI3)
(Daille, 1994). These measures are detailed in ta-
ble 5. The significant association threshold is in-
tuitively given by the statistical interpretation of

are used for LCC?s selection criterion 2 and T is
set to 0 (cf. 3.3). A threshold can not be deduced
from PS and PMI3, therefore they are only used
for LCC?s comparison criteria 3 & 4.
4.2 Evaluation Process
To prepare the evaluation we randomly selected
twenty texts in an evaluation corpus and anno-
tated lexical units according to the linguistic de-
scription given in Section 2. For each sample
text, we obtained a set of lexical unit trees (Ta-
ble 3) corresponding to all the encountered lex-
ical units. N-trees are used for units which can
not be transformed into binary tree. Two evalua-
tion sets are defined, the shallow set which con-
tains the root nodes of the lexical unit trees and
the deep set which contains the inner nodes5 of
the lexical unit trees. Given the four examples
of Figure 3, the shallow set contains [????],
[????], [?????] and (???) ; and the deep
set contains [????], (??), (??), [????],
[?????], (??), (???) and (??).
Experiments with different parameters produce
different candidate lists and an expert interven-
tion is required to evaluate each candidate list. To
avoid this problem, all the repeated sequences of
non-inflectional graphies are generated from the
annotated sample texts and intersected with the
LUC list. The obtained list is a projection of the
candidate list on the sample texts. This trick al-
lows us to extract all LUCs appearing in the sam-
5All nodes excluding leaves.

5 Experiments
The experiments are conducted on insurance do-
main corpus containing ten million graphies. This
evaluation corpus is composed of news and ar-
ticles collected automatically from Chinese in-
surance companies websites. The text fields are
extracted with an xhtml parser. Several text
fields, such as menus or buttons, are repeated
and duplicates are removed to avoid noise. The
presented method, referred as ILex (Incremen-
tal Lexicon Extractor), is applied using the pre-
viously mentioned 4 measures (cf. 4.1). The
evaluation is based on couple of measures, the
first measure is dedicated to candidates selection
(LCC 2.) and the second to candidates compar-
ison (LCC 3. & 4.). The comparison measure is
also used to sort the candidates (cf. 3.4). The max-
imal number of iterations is set to 3 (for a maxi-
mal depth of 4), which is the maximum number
of associations required to compose the majority
of lexical units in the reference corpus. The preci-
sion and recall are computed on the deep set in or-
der to consider all valid lexical units, the recall on
the shallow set is given to see the results on wider
lexical units (Table 6). The results show that PMI-
LL couple performs better overall than the other
measures. It can be noticed that the scores are rel-
atively close (?1.8% for precision and ?7.0% for
deep recall) meaning that the choice of the associ-
ation measure has a low influence over the results.
For the further experiments are conducted with
PMI-LL, which achieves the best recall score.

The method extracted 585,794 LUCs from the
whole corpus using the PMI-LL couple before ap-
plying the user interaction step. The candidate
list projection (cf. 4.2) contains 4,539 LUCs. The
user decisions are simulated with the lexical unit
trees obtained from sample texts. In total 312
LUCs were removed in consequence of the user
interaction (cf. 3.5), without this step the preci-
sion decreases to 33.7%. The 1,246 LUCs present
in the common-word dictionary are ignored. Fi-
nally 1,886 invalid candidates and 1,105 valid lex-
ical units are submitted to the user, the evaluation
is based on these 3,059 LUCs.

A sample of extracted lexical units is presented

occurrences is 1 and the longest unit length is

are terms, a significant number of people names,
common words and larger named entities are ex-
tracted too. The most part of the very frequent
lexical units are ranked at the top of the list but
some low frequency LUCs are ranked over the
high frequency candidates. The Figure 4 presents

The LL sorting is compared to frequency sort-
ing for the precision at rank n. The LL sort-
ing curve is above the frequency sorting curve,
this fact shows that LL is more efficient at sort-
ing valid LUCs. The majority of the missed can-
didates have a low number of occurrences (?3)
and 57.8% of the longest lexical unit (>7) are
also missed. Most of extraction errors have a
low number of occurrences, 40.1% of the er-
rors are caused by lexical unit composition errors
(e.g. *(insurance??)?|study?| in [ insurance institute(??)(??)] or *( reform??)|commission?| in
[

(e.g. ( extend??)?[agricultural Insurance???? ] or ( standard??)?(development??)).
The AccessVar method (Feng et al, 2004),
an unsupervised lexicon extraction method hav-
ing the best performance, was reimplemented and
used as a reference. This method uses the corpus
substrings? number of distinct contexts, noted AV
(accessor variety), to extract candidates. Access-
Var is configured by an accessors variety thresh-
old (AVT), which is the minimal AV required to
hold a candidate, the number of occurrences of
candidates is consequently greater or equal to the
AVT. For the experiments, the candidate maximal
length is set to 7 graphies6 and AVT to 3. Sim-
ilarly, ILex candidates appearing less than three
times and having a length greater than 7 are dis-
carded. The ILex user interaction is not applied
for this comparison. In order unify the input data,
AccessVar handles the segments detected by ILex

AccessVar and ILex extract respectively
125,467 and 116,412 LUCs and the candidate list
projection contains 2,190 and 1,876 LUCs. The
results are computed on the deep set (figure 5).
AccessVar and ILex achieve respectively recall of
43.7% and 49.0%. A total of 667 of the lexical
units extracted are common to both methods, 161
lexical units are extracted exclusively by ILex
and 74 lexical units are extracted exclusively
by AccessVar. This means that both methods
have close covering capacities. From rank 100
to rank 700, the results are close but the curves
begin to diverge after this rank, this trend means
that the performance are similar for the 700
best candidates. However, ILex achieves 44.4%
precision which is 10.6% higher than AccessVar
(33.8%), this difference, in view of the close re-
call score, shows that ILex generates less invalid
candidates. The errors specific to AccessVar are
due to context adhesion errors (e.g. *(company??)?|specialty?| in
[
insurance industry
(??)(??)], [ insurance product(??)(??)], [ insurance produce(??)(??)] etc.), or
association errors (e.g. *|country?|?|East?|, *( industry??)?( group??)).
ILex avoids these errors because of three mech-
anisms. First, the statistical likelihood between
the couple components is tested (e.g. *|country?|?|East?|
PMI score is negative). Second, the method
checks association likelihood of the contexts
before associating two morpho-syntactic units,
(e.g. (aeronautic??)( industry??) score is over *( industry??)?( group??)
score in [ Aviation Industries Corporation of China??????????]). Third, the in-
cremental association process determine smaller
unit before trying associating bigger couples
(e.g. ( insurance?? ) and ( industry?? ) are associated before
[
insurance industry
???? ] ).
6 Conclusion and Further Works
The presented method features incremental lexi-
cal unit extraction with interactive candidate fil-
tering capability. The maximal candidate length is
not imposed directly, but instead is determined by
the maximal number of associations. The lexical
resources required are re-usable and non-domain
specific, which significantly reduce their cost for
long-term deployment. The method achieves
decent performance and improves the reference
method?s precision for this task. Furthermore, the
extracted results include low-frequency and long
candidates which are known to be difficult to ex-
tract. Finally, the binary association process al-
lows us to sort the candidates by association mea-
sure, which is more relevant than frequency.
This paper also introduced the beginning of
a linguistically consistent lexical unit definition.
This definition draws the outlines of a corpus an-
notation guide dedicated to the lexicon extraction
task. The evaluation process is improved by the
lexical unit trees annotations and a candidate list
projection technique, which allows full-automatic
estimation of extraction system performance.
The first upcoming objective is the develop-
ment of a robust evaluation protocol for the lex-
ical extraction task. This is crucial for further im-
provements and means that the variation between
annotators of the evaluation corpus, and the sta-
bility of the method over different corpora need to
be considered. Finally we will try to solve the not
yet managed lexicon extraction issues, Latin char-
acters tokens which cause the method miss some
extractions (e.g. ( [product name]??A ) ), and the discontinuous
locutions (e.g. [[ reach on the phone???? ]] in ( call / through???)???( phone??)
or [[bear responsibility??? ]] in ???(bear?)?????(responsibility?? )).
