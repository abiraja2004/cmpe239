PROJECT GOALS 
The performance of spoken language systems on utterances 
from the ATI$ domain is evaluated by comparing system- 
produced responses with hand-crafted (and -verified) stan- 
dard responses to the same utterances. The objective of 
SRI's annotation project is to provide SLS system develop- 
ers with the range of correct responses to human utterances 
produced uring experimental sessions with ATIS domain 
interactive systems. These correct responses are then used 
in system training and evaluation. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Since June 1991, SRI has produced classification and 
response files for about 9,000 utterances of training data 
(2900 of these since February, 1992). A dry run system 
evaluation and two official evaluations have been held 
since the project began in 1991. SRI has produced the stan- 
dard responses for all of these evaluations; in all, about 
2300 utterances. 
These tests were performed according to the Common 
Answer Specification (CAS) protocol which is used in 
training. All systems are evaluated on a common set of 
data, with system responses measured against official refer- 
ence answers produced at SRI in the same m,anner as the 
training da~. 
In addition to producing the classification and standard 
response files, SRI takes an active role in the adjudication 
of test and training data bug reports, initiates nearly all of 
the changes to the Principles oflnterpretation document (a 
basic set of principles for interpreting the meaning of ATIS 
sentences agreed upon by the DARPA community), and 
continues to support NIST by modifying software and act- 
ing as a consultant regarding the annotation of data. 
In 1992 the DARPA community developed a complemen- 
tary evaluation method, referred to alternately as "end-to- 
end" or "logfile" evaluation, to better evaluate system-nser 
interfaces. Using an interactive program developed by 
David Goodine at MIT, human evaluators from SRI and 
NIST used this end-to-end method in a dry run evaluation 
in December, 1992. For each query/response pair in 128 
interactions, the human evaluators judged the correctness 
or appropriateness of system responses, and classified the 
type of user request and type of system response. 
The use of human evaluators allowed more flexibility in 
scoring than an automatic, omparator-based method. This 
method allowed partial correctness judgements and the 
opportunity o score system responses which were not data- 
base retrievals, uch as diagnostic messages and directives 
to the user. Because human evaluators saw the interaction 
from the point of view of the iJser, the results of the logfile 
evaluation method aided system developers by identifying 
dialogue and user interface problems which werenot indi- 
cated by the usual CAS evaluation method. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
In the next year, SRI will continue to provide MADCOW 
annotation and other services to the DARPA community.
