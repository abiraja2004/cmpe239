Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel morphol-
ogy preprocessing technique for Arabic-
English translation. We exploit the Arabic
morphology-English alignment to learn a
model removing nonaligned Arabic mor-
phemes. The model is an instance of
the Conditional Random Field (Lafferty et
al., 2001) model; it deletes a morpheme
based on the morpheme?s context. We
achieved around two BLEU points im-
provement over the original Arabic trans-
lation for both a travel-domain system
trained on 20K sentence pairs and a news
domain system trained on 177K sentence
pairs, and showed a potential improvement
for a large-scale SMT system trained on 5
million sentence pairs.
1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation (SMT) relies heav-
ily on the word alignment model of the source
and the target language. However, there is a
mismatch between a rich morphology language
(e.g Arabic, Czech) and a poor morphology lan-
guage (e.g English). An Arabic source word of-
ten corresponds to several English words. Pre-
vious research has focused on attempting to ap-
ply morphological analysis to machine translation
in order to reduce unknown words of highly in-
flected languages. Nie?en and Ney (2004) rep-
resented a word as a vector of morphemes and
gained improvement over word-based system for

German-English translation. Goldwater and Mc-
closky (2005) improved Czech-English translation
by applying different heuristics to increase the
equivalence of Czech and English text.
Specially for Arabic-English translation, Lee
(2004) used the Arabic part of speech and English
parts of speech (POS) alignment probabilities to
retain an Arabic affix, drop it from the corpus or
merge it back to a stem. The resulting system
outperformed the original Arabic system trained
on 3.3 million sentence pairs corpora when using
monotone decoding. However, an improvement
in monotone decoding is no guarantee for an im-
provement over the best baseline achievable with
full word forms. Our experiments showed that an
SMT phrase-based translation using 4 words dis-
tance reordering could gain four BLEU points over
monotone decoding. Sadat and Habash (2006) ex-
plored a wide range of Arabic word-level prepro-
cessing and produced better translation results for
a system trained on 5 million Arabic words.
What all the above methodologies do not pro-
vide is a means to disambiguate morphologi-
cal analysis for machine translation based on the
words? contexts. That is, for an Arabic word anal-
ysis of the form prefix*-stem-suffix* a morpheme
only is either always retained, always dropped off
or always merged to the stem regardless of its
surrounding text. In the example in Figure (1),
the Arabic word ?AlnAfi*h?(?window? in English)
was segmented as ?Al nAfi* ap?. The morpheme
?ap? is removed so that ?Al nAfi*? aligned to ?the
window? of the English sentence. In the sentence
?hl ldyk mqAEd bjwAr AlnAf*h ?? (?do you have
window tables ?? in English) the word ?AlnAfi*h?
is also segmented as ?Al nAfi* ap?. But in this
sentence, morphological preprocessing should re-
move both ?Al? and ?ap? so that only the remain-

ing morpheme ?nAfi*? aligned to the word ?win-
dow? of the English translation. Thus an appropri-
ate preprocessing technique should be guided by
English translation and bring the word context into
account.
In this paper we describe a context-based mor-
phological analysis for Arabic-English translation
that take full account morphemes alignment to En-
glish text. The preprocessing uses the Arabic mor-
phology disambiguation in (Smith et al, 2005) for
full morphological analysis and learns the remov-
ing morphemes model based on the Viterbi align-
ment of English to full morphological analysis. We
tested the model with two training corpora of 5.2
millions Arabic words(177K sentences) in news
domain and 159K Arabic words (20K sentences)
in travel conversation domain and gain improve-
ment over the original Arabic translation in both
experiments. The system that trained on a sub-
sample corpora of 5 millions sentence pairs cor-
pora also showed one BLEU score improvement
over the original Arabic system on unseen test set.
We will explain our technique in the next section
and briefly review the phrase based SMT model in
section 3. The experiment results will be presented
in section 4.
2 Methodology
We first preprocess the Arabic training corpus and
segment words into morpheme sequences of the
form prefix* stem suffix*. Stems are verbs, adjec-
tives, nouns, pronouns, etc., carrying the content
of the sentence. Prefixes and suffixes are func-
tional morphemes such as gender and case mark-
ers, prepositions, etc. Because case makers do not
exist in English, we remove case marker suffixes
from the morphology output. The output of this
process is a full morphological analysis corpus.
Even after removing case markers, the token count
of the full morphology corpus still doubles the
original Arabic?s word token count and is approx-
imately 1.7 times the number of tokens of the En-
glish corpus. As stated above, using original Ara-
bic for translation introduces more unknown words
in test data and causes multiple English words to
map to one Arabic word. At the morpheme level,
an English word would correspond to a morpheme
in the full morphology corpus but some prefixes
and suffixes in the full morphology corpus may not
be aligned with any English words at all. For ex-
ample, the Arabic article ?Al? (?the? in English)
prefixes to both adjectives and nouns, while En-
glish has only one determiner in a simple noun
phrase. Using the full morphological analysis cor-
pus for translation would introduce redundant mor-
phemes in the source side.
The goal of our morphological analysis method
for machine translation is removing nonaligned
prefixes and suffixes from the full morphology cor-
pus using a data-driven approach. We use the word
alignment output of the full morphology corpus to
the English corpus to delete morphemes in a sen-
tence. If an affix is not aligned to an English word
in the word alignment output, the affix should be
removed from the morphology corpus for better
one-to-one alignment of source and target corpora.
However, given an unseen test sentence, the En-
glish translation of the sentence is not available to
remove affixes based on the word alignment out-
put. We therefore learn a model removing non-
aligned morphemes from the full morphology Ara-
bic training corpus and its alignment to the English
corpus. To obtain consistency between training
corpus and test set, we applied the model to both
Arabic training corpus and test set, obtaining pre-
processed morphology corpora for the translation
task.
In this section, we will explain in detail each
steps of our preprocessing methodology:
136
? Apply word segmentation to the Arabic train-
ing corpus to get the full morphological anal-
ysis corpus.
? Annotate the full morphological analysis cor-
pus based on its word alignment to the En-
glish training corpus. We tag a morpheme as
?Deleted? if it should be removed from the
corpus, and ?Retained? otherwise.
? Learn the morphology tagger model.
? Apply the model to both Arabic training cor-
pus and Arabic test corpus to get prepro-
cessed corpus for translation.
2.1 Arabic Word Segmentation
Smith et al (2005) applies a source-channel model
to the problem of morphology disambiguation.
The source model is a uniform model that de-
fines the set of analyses. For Arabic morphology
disambiguation, the source model uses the list of
un-weighted word analyses generated by BAMA
toolkit (Buckwalter, 2004). The channel model
disambiguates the morphology alternatives. It is a
log-linear combination of features, which capture
the morphemes? context including tri-gram mor-
pheme histories, tri-gram part-of-speech histories
and combinations of the two.
The BAMA toolkit and hence (Smith et al,
2005) do not specify if a morpheme is an affix or
a stem in the output. Given a segmentation of an
original Arabic word, we considered a morpheme
a
i
as a stem if its parts of speech p
i
is either a
noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, question, punctua-
tion, number or abbreviation. A morpheme on the
left of its word?s stem is a prefix and it is a suffix
if otherwise. We removed case marker morphemes
and got the full morphology corpus.
2.2 Annotate Morphemes
To extract the Arabic morphemes that align to
English text, we use English as the source cor-
pus and aligned to Arabic morpheme corpus us-
ing GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) toolkit. The
IBM3 and IBM4 (Brown et al, 1994) word align-
ment models select each word in the source sen-
tence, generate fertility and a list of target words
that connect to it. This generative process would
constrain source words to find alignments in the
target sentence. Using English as source corpus,
the alignment models force English words to gen-
erate their alignments in the Arabic morphemes.
GIZA++ outputs Viterbi alignment for every sen-
tence pair in the training corpus as depicted in (b)
and (c) of Figure (1). In our experiment, only 5%
of English words are not aligned to any Arabic
morpheme in the Viterbi alignment. From Viterbi
English-morpheme alignment output, we annotate
morphemes either to be deleted or retained as fol-
lows:
? Annotate stem morphemes as ?Retained?(R),
in dependant of word alignment output.
? Annotate a prefix or a suffix as ?Retained? (R)
if it is aligned to an English word.
? Annotate a prefix or a suffix as ?Deleted? (D)
if it is not aligned to an English word.
Note that the model does not assume that
GIZA++ outputs accurate word alignments. We
lessen the impact of the GIZA++ errors by only
using the word alignment output of prefix and suf-
fix morphemes.
Furthermore, because the full morphology sen-
tence is longer, each English word could align to a
separate morpheme. Our procedure of annotating
morphemes also constrains morphemes tagged as
?Retained? to be aligned to English words. Thus
if we remove ?Deleted? morphemes from the mor-
phology corpus, the reduced corpus and English
corpus have the property of one-to-one mapping
we prefer for source-target corpora in machine
translation.
2.3 Reduced Morphology Model
The reduced morphology corpus would be the
best choice of morphological analysis for machine
translation. Because it is impossible to tag mor-
phemes of a test sentence without the English ref-
erence based on Viterbi word alignment, we need
to learn a morpheme tagging model. The model
estimates the distributions of tagging sequences
given a morphologically analysed sentence using
the previous step?s annotated training data.
The task of tagging morphemes to be either
?Deleted? or ?Retained? belongs to the set of se-
quence labelling problems. The conditional ran-
dom fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al, 2001) model has
shown great benefits in similar applications of nat-
ural language processing such as part-of-speech
tagging, noun phrase chunking (Sha and Pereira,
2003), morphology disambiguation(Smith et al,
2005). We apply the CRF model to our morpheme
tagging problem.

The feature functions {f

can accommodate many closely related features
of the input. In our morpheme tagging model,
we use morpheme features, part-of-speech features
and combinations of both. The features capture
the local contexts of morphemes. The lexical mor-
pheme features are the combinations of the current
morpheme and up to 2 previous and 2 following
morphemes. The part-of-speech features are the
combinations of the current part of speech and up
to 3 previous part of speeches. The part of speech,
morpheme combination features capture the de-
pendencies of current morphemes and up to its 3
previous parts of speech.
2.4 Preprocessed Data

morpheme tagging model learnt as described in the
previous section to decode A into the most proba-
ble sequence of tags T? = t

If a t

is ?Deleted?, the morpheme a

is removed
from the morphology sentence A. The same pro-
cedure is applied to both training Arabic corpus
and test corpus to get preprocessed data for transla-
tion. We call a morphology sentence after remov-
ing ?Deleted? tag a reduced morphology sentence.
In our experiments, we used the freely available
CRF++1 toolkit to train and decode with the mor-
pheme tagging model. The CRF model smoothed
the parameters by assigning them Gaussian prior
distributions.
3 Phrase-based SMT System
We used the open source Moses (Koehn, 2007)
phrase-based MT system to test the impact of the
preprocessing technique on translation results. We
kept the default parameter settings of Moses for
translation model generation. The system used the
?grow-diag-final? alignment combination heuris-
tic. The phrase table consisted of phrase pairs up to
seven words long. The system used a tri-gram lan-
guage model built from SRI (Stolcke, 2002) toolkit
with modified Kneser-Ney interpolation smooth-
ing technique (Chen and Goodman, 1996). By de-
fault, the Moses decoder uses 6 tokens distance re-
ordering windows.
4 Experiment Results
In this section we present experiment results using
our Arabic morphology preprocessing technique.
4.1 Data Sets
We tested our morphology technique on a small
data set of 20K sentence pairs and a medium size
data set of 177K sentence pairs.
4.1.1 BTEC Data
As small training data set we used the BTEC
corpus (Takezawa et al, 2002) distributed by
the International Workshop on Spoken Language
Translation (IWSLT) (Eck and Hori, 2005). The
corpus is a collection of conversation transcripts
from the travel domain. Table 1 gives some de-

tails for this corpus, which consists of nearly 20K
sentence pairs with lower case on the English side.
There is an imbalance of word types and word to-
kens between original Arabic and English. The
1http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/
138
original Arabic sentences are on average shorter
than the English sentences whereas the Arabic vo-
cabulary is more than twice the size of the English
vocabulary. The word segmentation reduced the
number of word types in the corpus to be closed
to English side but also increased word tokens
quite substantially. By removing nonaligned mor-
phemes, the reduced corpus is well balanced with
the English corpus.
The BTEC experiments used the 2004 IWSLT
Evaluation Test set as development set and 2005
IWSLT Evaluation Test set as unseen test data.
Table 2 gives the details of the two test sets. Both
of them had 16 reference translations per source
sentence. The English side of the training corpus
was used to build the language model. To optimize
the parameters of the decoder, we performed min-
imum error rate training on IWSLT04 optimizing
for the IBM-BLEU metric (Papineni et al, 2002).
4.1.2 Newswire Corpora
We also tested the impact of our morphology
technique on parallel corpus in the news domain.
The corpora were collected from LDC?s full Ara-
bic news translation corpora and a small portion
of UN data. The details of the data are give in
Table 3. The data consists of 177K sentence pairs,
5.2M words on the Arabic and 6M words on the
English side.

Table 3: Newswire corpus statistics
We used two test sets from past NIST evalua-
tions as test data. NIST MT03 was used as devel-
opment set for optimizing parameters with respect
to the IBM-BLEU metric, NIST MT06 was used
as unseen test set. Both test sets have 4 references
per test sentence. Table 4 describes the data statis-
tics of the two test sets. All Newswire translation
experiments used the same language model esti-
mated from 200 million words collected from the
Xinhua section of the GIGA word corpus.
4.2 Translation Results
4.2.1 BTEC
We evaluated the machine translation accord-
ing to the case-insensitive BLEU metric. Table 5
shows the BTEC results when translated with de-
fault Moses setting of distance-based reordering
window size 6. The original Arabic word trans-
lation was the baseline of the evaluation. The
second row contains translation scores using the
full morphology translation. Our new technique of
context-based morphological analysis is shown in
the last row.

Table 5: BTEC translations results on IBM-BLEU

nificantly higher than the original Arabic transla-
tion scores.
The full morphology translation performed sim-
ilar to the baseline on the development set but
outperformed the baseline on the unseen test set.
The reduced corpus showed significant improve-
ments over the baseline on the development set
(IWSLT04) and gave an additional small improve-
ment over the full morphology score over the un-
seen data (IWSLT05).
So why did the reduced morphology translation
not outperform more significantly the full mor-
phology translation on unseen set IWSLT05? To
analysis this in more detail, we selected good
full morphology translations and compared them
with the corresponding reduced morphology trans-
lations. Figure 2 shows one of these examples.
Typically, the reduced morphology translations

are shorter than both the references and the full
morphology outputs. Table 2 shows that for the
IWSLT05 test set, the ratio of the average En-

tence length is slightly higher than the correspond-
ing ratio for IWSLT04. Using the parameters op-
timised for IWSLT04 to translate IWSLT05 sen-
tences would generate hypotheses slightly shorter
than the IWSLT05 references resulting in brevity
penalties in the BLEU metric. The IWSLT05
brevity penalties for original Arabic, reduced mor-
phology and full morphology are 0.969, 0.978 and
0.988 respectively. Note that the BTEC corpus and
test sets are in the travel conversation domain, the
English reference sentences contain a large num-
ber of high frequency words. The full morpho-
logical analysis with additional prefixes and suf-
fixes outputs longer translations containing high
frequency words resulting in a high n-gram match
and lower BLEU brevity penalty. The reduced
translation method could generate translations that
are comparable but do not have the same effect on
BLEU metrics.
4.2.2 Newswire results
Table 6 presents the translation results for the
Newswire corpus. Even though morphology seg-
mentation reduced the number of unseen words,
the translation results of full morphological anal-
ysis are slightly lower than the original Arabic
scores in both development set MT03 and unseen
test set MT06. This is consistent with the result
achieved in previous literature (Sadat and Habash,
2006). Morphology preprocessing only helps with
small corpora, but the advantage decreases for
larger data sets.

shows significant improvements on both develop-
ment and unseen test sets. Moreover, while the ad-
vantage of morphology segmentation diminishes
for the full morphology translation, we achieve an
improvement of more than two BLEU points over
the original Arabic translations in both develop-
ment set and unseen test set.
4.3 Unknown Words Reduction
A clear advantage of using morphology based
translation over original word translation is the
reduction in the number of untranslated words.
Table 7 compares the number of unknown Arabic
tokens for original Arabic translation and reduced
morphology translation. In all the test sets, mor-
phology translations reduced the number of un-
known tokens by more than a factor of two.
4.4 The Impact of Reordering Distance Limit
The reordering window length is determined based
on the movements of the source phrases. On an
average, an original Arabic word has two mor-

phemes. The full morphology translation with a
6-word reordering window has the same impact
as a 3-word reordering when translating the orig-
inal Arabic. To fully benefit from word reorder-
ing, the full morphology translation requires a
longer reorder distance limit. However, in current
phrase based translations, reordering models are
not strong enough to guide long distance source-
word movements. This shows an additional advan-
tage of the nonaligned morpheme removal tech-
nique.
We carried out experiments from monotone de-
coding up to 9 word distance reordering limit for
the two development sets IWSLT04 and MT03.
The results are given in Table 8. The BTEC data
set does not benefit from a larger reordering win-
dow. Using only a 2-word reordering window
the score of the original Arabic translations(57.92)
was comparable to the best score (58.31) obtained
by using a 4-word reordering window. On the
other hand, the reordering limit showed a signifi-
cant impact on Newswire data. The MT03 original
Arabic translation using a 4-word re-ordering win-
dow resulted in an improvement of 4 BLEU points
over monotone decoding. Large Arabic corpora
usually contain data from the news domain. The
decoder might not effectively reorder very long
distance morphemes for these data sets. This ex-
plains why machine translation does not benefit
from word-based morphological segmentation for
large data sets which adequately cover the vocabu-
lary of the test set.
4.5 Large Training Corpora Results
We wanted to test the impact of our preprocess-
ing technique on a system trained on 5 million
sentence pairs (128 million Arabic words). Un-
fortunately, the CRF++ toolkit exceeded memory
limits when executed even on a 24GB server. We
created smaller corpora by sub-sampling the large
corpus for the source side of MT03 and MT06
test sets. The sub-sampled corpus have 500K sen-
tence pairs and cover all source phrases of MT03
and MT06 which can be found in the large cor-
pus. In these experiments, we used a lexical re-
ordering model into translation model. The lan-
guage model was the 5-gram SRI language model
built from the whole GIGA word corpus. Table 9

system trained on the full 5M sentence pairs cor-
pus and the three systems trained on the 500K sen-
tence pairs sub-sampled corpus. The sub-sampled
full morphology system scores degraded for both
development set and unseen test set. On devel-
opment set, the sub-sampled reduced morphology
system score was slightly better than baseline. On
the unseen test set, it significantly outperformed
both the baseline on sub-sampled training data and
even outperformed the system trained on the entire
141
5M sentence pairs.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented a context-dependent
morphology preprocessing technique for Arabic-
English translation. The model significantly out-
performed the original Arabic systems on small
and mid-size corpora and unseen test set on large
training corpora. The model treats morphology
processing task as a sequence labelling problem.
Therefore, other machine learning techniques such
as perceptron (Collins, 2002) could also be applied
for this problem.
The paper also discussed the relation between
the size of the reordering window and morphol-
ogy processing. In future investigations, we plan
to extend the model such that merging morphemes
is included. We also intent to study the impact of
phrase length and phrase extraction heuristics.
