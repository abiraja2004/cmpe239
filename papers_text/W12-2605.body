Abstract
The development of summarization systems
requires reliable similarity (evaluation) mea-
sures that compare system outputs with hu-
man references. A reliable measure should
have correspondence with human judgements.
However, the reliability of measures depends
on the test collection in which the measure
is meta-evaluated; for this reason, it has not
yet been possible to reliably establish which
are the best evaluation measures for automatic
summarization. In this paper, we propose
an unsupervised method called Heterogeneity-
Based Ranking (HBR) that combines summa-
rization evaluation measures without requiring
human assessments. Our empirical results in-
dicate that HBR achieves a similar correspon-
dence with human assessments than the best
single measure for every observed corpus. In
addition, HBR results are more robust across
topics than single measures.
1 Introduction
In general, automatic evaluation metrics for summa-
rization are similarity measures that compare system
outputs with human references. The typical develop-
ment cycle of a summarization system begins with
selecting the most predictive metric. For this, evalu-
ation metrics are compared to each other in terms

of correlation with human judgements. The sec-
ond step consists of tuning the summarization sys-
tem (typically in several iterations) in order to maxi-
mize the scores according to the selected evaluation
measure.
There is a wide set of available measures beyond
the standard ROUGE: for instance, those comparing
basic linguistic elements (Hovy et al., 2005), depen-
dency triples (Owczarzak, 2009) or convolution ker-
nels (Hirao et al., 2005) which reported some relia-
bility improvement with respect to ROUGE in terms
of correlation with human judgements. However,
in practice ROUGE is still the preferred metric of
choice. The main reason is that the superiority of a
measure with respect to other is not easy to demon-
strate: the variability of results across corpora, ref-
erence judgements (Pyramid vs responsiveness) and
correlation criteria (system vs. summary level) is
substantial. In the absence of a clear quality crite-
rion, the de-facto standard is usually the most rea-
sonable choice.
In this paper we rethink the development cy-
cle of summarization systems. Given that the best
measure changes across evaluation scenarios, we
propose using multiple automatic evaluation mea-
sures, together with an unsupervised method to com-
bine measures called Heterogeneity Based Rank-
ing (HBR). This method is grounded on the gen-
eral Heterogeneity property proposed in (Amigo? et
al., 2011), which states that the more a measure
set is heterogeneous, the more a score increase ac-
cording to all the measures simultaneously is reli-
able. In brief, the HBR method consists of com-
puting the heterogeneity of measures for which a
36
system-produced summary improves each of the rest
of summaries in comparison.
Our empirical results indicate that HBR achieves
a similar correspondence with human assessments
than the best single measure for every observed cor-
pus. In addition, HBR results are more robust across
topics than single measures.
2 Definitions
We consider here the definition of similarity mea-
sure proposed in (Amigo? et al., 2011):
Being ? the universe of system outputs (sum-
maries) s and gold-standards (human references) g,
we assume that a similarity measure is a function
x : ?2 ?? < such that there exists a decompo-
sition function f : ? ?? {e1..en} (e.g., words
or other linguistic units or relationships) satisfying
the following constraints; (i) maximum similarity is
achieved only when the summary decomposition re-
sembles exactly the gold standard; (ii) adding one
element from the gold standard increases the simi-
larity; and (iii) removing one element that does not
appear in the gold standard also increases the simi-
larity. Formally:
f(s) = f(g)?? x(s, g) = 1
(f(s) = f(s?) ? {eg ? f(g) \ f(s)}) =?
x(s, g) > x(s?, g)
(f(s) = f(s?)? {e?g ? f(s) \ f(g)}) =?
x(s, g) > x(s?, g)
This definition excludes random functions, or the
inverse of any similarity function (e.g. 1f(s) ). It
covers, however, any overlapping or precision/recall
measure over words, n-grams, syntactic structures or
any kind of semantic unit. In the rest of the paper,
given that the gold standard g in summary evaluation
is usually fixed, we will simplify the notation saying
that x(s, g) ? x(s).
We consider also the definition of heterogeneity
of a measure set proposed in (Amigo? et al., 2011):
The heterogeneity H(X ) of a set of measures X is
defined as, given two summaries s and s? such that
g 6= s 6= s? 6= g (g is the reference text), the proba-
bility that there exists two measures that contradict
each other.
H(X ) ?
Ps,s? 6=g(?x, x
? ? X/x(s) > x(s?) ? x?(s) < x?(s?))
3 Proposal
The proposal in this paper is grounded on the hetero-
geneity property of evaluation measures introduced
in (Amigo? et al., 2011). This property establishes
a relationship between heterogeneity and reliability
of measures. However, this work does not provide
any method to evaluate and rank summaries given a
set of available automatic evaluation measures. We
now reformulate the heterogeneity property in order
to define a method to combine measures and rank
systems.
3.1 Heterogeneity Property Reformulation
The heterogeneity property of evaluation measures
introduced in (Amigo? et al., 2011) states that, as-
suming that measures are based on similarity to hu-
man references, the real quality difference between
two texts is lower bounded by the heterogeneity of
measures that corroborate the quality increase. We
reformulate this property in the following way:
Given a set of automatic evaluation measures
based on similarity to human references, the prob-
ability of a quality increase in summaries is corre-
lated with the heterogeneity of the set of measures
that corroborate this increase:
P (Q(s) ? Q(s?)) ? H({x|x(s) ? x(s?)})
where Q(s) is the quality of the summary s accord-
ing to human assessments. In addition, the proba-
bility is maximal if the heterogeneity is maximal:
H({x|x(s) ? x(s?)}) = 1? P (Q(s) ? Q(s?)) = 1
The first part is derived from the fact that
increasing heterogeneity requires additional di-
verse measures corroborating the similarity increase
(H({x|x(s) ? x(s?)}))). The correlation is the re-
sult of assuming that a similarity increase accord-
ing to any aspect is always a positive evidence of
true similarity to human references. In other words,
37
a positive match between the automatic summary
and the human references, according to any feature,
should never be a negative evidence of quality.
As for the second part, if the heterogeneity of a
measure set X is maximal, then the condition of
the heterogeneity definition (?x, x? ? X .x(s) >
x(s?) ? x?(s) < x?(s?)) holds for any pair of sum-
maries that are different from the human references.
Given that all measures in X corroborate the simi-
larity increase (X = {x|x(s) ? x(s?)}), the hetero-
geneity condition does not hold. Then, at least one
of the evaluated summaries is not different from the
human reference and we can ensure that P (Q(s) ?
Q(s?)) = 1.
3.2 The Heterogeneity Based Ranking
The main goal in summarization evaluation is rank-
ing systems according to their quality. This can be
seen as estimating, for each system-produced sum-
mary s, the average probability of being ?better?
than other summaries:
Rank(s) = Avgs?(P (Q(s) ? Q(s
?)))
Applying the reformulated heterogeneity property
we can estimate this as:
HBRX (s) = Avgs?(H({x|x(s) ? x(s
?)}))
We refer to this ranking function as the Heterogene-
ity Based Ranking (HBR). It satisfies three crucial
properties for a measure combining function. Note
that, assuming that any similarity measure over hu-
man references represents a positive evidence of
quality, the measure combining function must be
at least robust with respect to redundant or random
measures:
1. HBR is independent from measure scales and
it does not require relative weighting schemes
between measures. Formally, being f any strict
growing function:
HBRx1..xn(s) = HBRx1..f(xn)(s)
2. HBR is not sensitive to redundant measures:
HBRx1..xn(s) = HBRx1..xn,xn(s)
3. Given a large enough set of similarity
instances, HBR is not sensitive to non-
informative measures. In other words, being
xr a random function such that P (xr(s) >
xr(s?)) = 12 , then:
HBRx1..xn(s) ? HBRx1..xn,xr(s)
The first two properties are trivially satisfied: the
? operator in H and the score comparisons are not af-
fected by redundant measures nor their scale proper-
ties. Regarding the third property, the Heterogeneity
of a set of measures plus a random function xr is:
H(X ? {xr}) ?
Ps,s?(?x, x
? ? X?{xr}|x(s) > x(s
?)?x?(s) < x?(s?)) =
H(X ) + (1?H(X )) ?

=
H(X ) + 1

That is, the Heterogeneity grows proportionally
when including a random function. Assuming that
the random function corroborates the similarity in-
crease in a half of cases, the result is a proportional
relationship between HBR and HBR with the addi-
tional measure. Note that we need to assume a large
enough amount of data to avoid random effects.
4 Experimental Setting
4.1 Test Bed
We have used the AS test collections used in the
DUC 2005 and DUC 2006 evaluation campaigns1
(Dang, 2005; Dang, 2006). The task was to gener-
ate a question focused summary of 250 words from a
set of 25-50 documents to a complex question. Sum-
maries were evaluated according to several criteria.
Here, we will consider the responsiveness judge-
ments, in which the quality score was an integer be-
tween 1 and 5. See Table 1 for a brief numerical
description of these test beds.
In order to check the measure combining method,
we have employed standard variants of ROUGE
(Lin, 2004), including the reversed precision version
for each variant 2. We have considered also the F

measure between recall and precision oriented mea-
sures. Finally, our measure set includes also BE or
Basic Elements (Hovy et al., 2006).
4.2 Meta-evaluation criterion
The traditional way of meta-evaluating measures
consists of computing the Pearson correlation be-
tween measure scores and quality human assess-
ments. But the main goal of automatic evaluation
metrics is not exactly to predict the real quality of
systems; rather than this, their core mission is de-
tecting system outputs that improve the baseline sys-
tem in each development cycle. Therefore, the issue
is to what extent a quality increase between two sys-
tem outputs is reflected by the output ranking pro-
duced by the measure.
According to this perspective, we propose meta-
evaluating measures in terms of an extended version
of AUC (Area Under the Curve). AUC can be seen
as the probability of observing a score increase when
observing a real quality increase between two sys-
tem outputs (Fawcett, 2006).
AUC(x) = P (x(s) > x(s?)|Q(s) > Q(s?))
In order to customize this measure to our scenario,
two special cases must be handled:
(i) For cases in which both summaries obtain the
same value, we assume that the measure rewards
each instance with equal probability. That is, if
x(s) = x(s?),P (x(s) > x(s?)|Q(s) > Q(s?)) = 12 .
(ii) Given that in the AS evaluation scenarios there
are multiple quality levels, we still apply the same
probabilistic AUC definition, considering pairs of
summaries in which one of them achieves more
quality than the other according to human assessors.

crease and Heterogeneity of measures that corroborate
the increase
5 Experiments
5.1 Measure Heterogeneity vs. Quality
Increase
We hypothesize that the probability of a real similar-
ity increase to human references (as stated by human
assessments) is directly related to the heterogeneity
of the set of measures that confirm such increase. In
order to verify whether this principle holds in prac-
tice, we need to measure the correlation between
both variables. Therefore, we compute, for each pair
of summaries in the same topic the heterogeneity of
the set of measures that corroborate a score increase
between both:
H({x ? X |x(s) ? x(s?)})
The Heterogeneity has been estimated by counting
cases over 10,000 samples (pairs of summaries) in
both corpora.
Then, we have sorted each pair ?s, s?? according
to its related heterogeneity. We have divided the re-
sulting rank in 100 intervals of the same size. For
39

each interval, we have computed the average hetero-
geneity of the set and the probability of real quality
increase (P (Q(s) ? Q(s?))).
Figure 1 displays the results. Note that the direct
relation between both variables is clear: a key for
predicting a real quality increase is how heteroge-
neous is the set of measures corroborating it.
5.2 HBR vs. Single Measures
In the following experiment, we compute HBR and
we compare the resulting AUC with that of single
measures. The heterogeneity of measures is esti-
mated over samples in both corpora (DUC 2005 and
DUC 2006), and HBR ranking is computed to rank
summaries for each topic. For the meta-evaluation,
the AUC probability is computed over summary
pairs from the same topic.
Figure 2 shows the resulting AUC values of sin-
gle measures and HBR. The black bar represents the
HBR approach. The light grey bars are ROUGE
measures oriented to precision. The dark grey bars
include ROUGE variants oriented to recall and F,
and the measure BE. As the Figure shows, recall-
based measures achieve in general higher AUC val-
ues than precision-oriented measures. The HBR
measure combination appears near the top. It is im-
proved by some measures such as ROUGE SU4 R,
although the difference is not statistically significant
(p = 0.36 for a t-test between ROUGE SU4 R and
HBR, for instance). HBR improves the 10 worst
single measures with statistical significance (p <
0.025).
5.3 Robustness
The next question is why using HBR instead of the
?best? measure (ROUGE-SU4-R in this case). As
we mentioned, the reliability of measures can vary
across scenarios. For instance, in DUC scenarios
most systems are extractive, and exploit the maxi-
mum size allowed in the evaluation campaign guide-
lines. Therefore, the precision over long n-grams is
not crucial, given that the grammaticality of sum-
maries is ensured. In this scenario the recall over
words or short n-grams over human references is a
clear signal of quality. But we can not ensure that
these characteristics will be kept in other corpora, or
even when evaluating new kind of summarizers with
the same corpora.
Our hypothesis is that, given that HBR resembles
the best measure without using human assessments,
it should have a more stable performance in situa-
tions where the best measure changes.
In order to check empirically this assertion, we
have investigated the lower bound performance of
measures in our test collections. First, we have
ranked measures for each topic according to their
AUC values; Then, we have computed, for every
measure, its rank regarding the rest of measures
(scaled from 0 to 1). Finally, we average each mea-
sure across the 10% of topics in which the measure
40

gets the worst ranks. Figure 3 shows the results: the
worst performance of HBR across topics is better
than the worst performance of any single measure.
This confirms that the combination of measures us-
ing HBR is indeed more robust than any measure in
isolation.
5.4 Consistent vs. Inconsistent Topics
The Heterogeneity property is grounded on the as-
sumption that any similarity criteria represents a
positive evidence of similarity to human references.
In general, we can assert that this assumption holds
over a large enough random set of texts. However,
depending on the distribution of summaries in the
corpus, this assumption may not always hold. For
instance, we can assume that, given all possible sum-
maries, improving the word precision with respect to
the gold standard can never be a negative evidence
of quality. However, for a certain topic, it could hap-
pen that the worst summaries are also the shortest,
and have high precision and low recall. In this case,
precision-based similarity could be correlated with
negative quality. Let us refer to these as inconsis-
tent topics vs. consistent topics. In terms of AUC,
a measure represents a negative evidence of quality
when AUC is lower than 0.5. Our test collections
contain 100 topics, out of which 25 are inconsis-
tent (i.e., at least one measure achieves AUC values
lower than 0.5) and 75 are consistent with respect to
our measure set (all measures achieve AUC values
higher than 0.5).
Figure ?? illustrates the AUC achieved by mea-
sures when inconsistent topics are excluded. As with
the full set of topics, recall-based measures achieve
higher AUC values than precision-based measures;
but, in this case, HBR appears at the top of the rank-
ing. This result illustrates that (i) HBR behaves par-
ticularly well when our assumptions on similarity
measures hold in the corpus; and that (ii) in prac-
tice, there may be topics for which our assumptions
do not hold.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have confirmed that the heterogene-
ity of a set of summary evaluation measures is cor-
related with the probability of finding a real quality
improvement when all measures corroborate it. The
HBR measure combination method is based on this
principle, which is grounded on the assumption that
any similarity increase with respect to human refer-
ences is a positive signal of quality.
Our empirical results indicate that the Hetero-
geneity Based Ranking achieves a reliability simi-
lar to the best single measure in the set. In addi-
41

which all measures achieve AUC bigger than 0.5.
tion, HBR results are more robust across topics than
single measures. Our experiments also suggest that
HBR behaves particularly well when the assump-
tions of the heterogeneity property holds in the cor-
pus. These assumptions are conditioned by the dis-
tribution of summaries in the corpus (in particular,
on the amount and variability of the summaries that
are compared with human references), and in prac-
tice 25% of the topics in our test collections do not
satisfy them for our set of measures.
The HBR (Heterogeneity Based Ranking) method
proposed in this paper does not represent the ?best
automatic evaluation measure?. Rather than this, it
promotes the development of new measures. What
HBR does is solving ?or at least palliating? the prob-
lem of reliability variance of measures across test
beds. According to our analysis, our practical rec-
ommendations for system refinement are:
1. Compile an heterogenous set of measures, cov-
ering multiple linguistic aspects (such as n-
gram precision, recall, basic linguistic struc-
tures, etc.).
2. Considering the summarization scenario, dis-
card measures that might not always represent
a positive evidence of quality. For instance,
if very short summaries are allowed (e.g. one
word) and they are very frequent in the set of
system outputs to be compared to each other,
precision oriented measures may violate HBR
assumptions.
3. Evaluate automatically your new summariza-
tion approach within this corpus according to
the HBR method.
Our priority for future work is now developing
a reference benchmark containing an heterogenous
set of summaries, human references and measures
satisfying the heterogeneity assumptions and cover-
ing multiple summarization scenarios where differ-
ent measures play different roles.
