Concept-to-Speech (CTS) systems, 
which aim to synthesize speech from 
semantic information and discourse 
context, have succeeded in produc- 
ing more appropriate and natural- 
sounding prosody than text-to-speech 
(TTS) systems, which rely mostly on 
syntactic and orthographic informa- 
tion. In this paper, we show how 
recent advances in CTS systems can 
be used to improve intonation in text 
reading systems for English. Specif- 
ically, following (Prevost, 1995; Pre- 
vost, 1996), we show how informa- 
tion structure is used by our program 
to produce intonational patterns with 
context-appropriate variation in pitch 
accent type and prominence. Follow- 
ing (Cahn, 1994; Cahn, 1997), we also 
show how some of the semantic infor- 
mation used by such CTS systems can 
be drawn from WordNet (Miller et al, 
1993), a large-scale semantic lexicon. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Although theories relating intonational patterns 
with discourse phenomena have been proposed 
(Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990), existing 
TTS systems, and even CTS systems, often fail 
to exploit them. The most advanced intonation 
systems (Hirschberg, 1990; Hirschberg, 1993) 
have relied on elements of discourse context 
which are relatively easy to extract from text, 
such as lexical givenness. Our system augments 
this approach by analyzing information struc- 
ture and drawing semantic information from a 
large-scale semantic database. 
Information structure is identified by first 
dividing utterances into semantic propositions 
rather than syntactic constituents (cf. (Mon- 
aghan, 1994)), in accordance with our belief 
that intonational domains are often orthogonal 
to traditional syntactic onstituents. 1 These se- 
mantic propositions are then sub-divided into 
theme (or topic) and theme (or comment). 
The theme of the proposition represents a link 
to prior utterances, whereas the rheme pro- 
vides the core contribution--roughly, the new 
or interesting part--of the proposition. Based 
on previous intonation generation work (Pre- 
vost and Steedman, 1994), thematic and rhe- 
matic items requiring accentuation are assigned 
Lq-H* and H* pitch accents respectively. 
The notion that large databases in TTS 
systems can substitute for application-specific 
knowledge bases has been suggested by (Horne 
et al, 1993) and (Cahn, 1994). Following 
Cahn's proposal (Cahn, 1994) and implemen- 
tation (Cahn, 1997), we employ WordNet to 
identify lexical items related by synonymy, hy- 
pernymy or hyponymy, and also to identify con- 
trastive lexical items. However, our use of infor- 
mation structure situates our work in a different 
theoretical framework from Cahn's. 
1 (Steedman, 1991) and (Prevost and Steedman, I994) 
show how the correspondence b tween intonational 
phrasing and semantic onstituency an be modeled by 
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), a formalism 
allowing amore flexible notion of syntactic onstituency.

In the remainder of this paper we describe 
how our present TTS research builds on the 
growing body of CTS research. First we present 
the motivation for our approach and the under- 
lying theoretical model of intonation. Then we 
briefly introduce WordNet. Next, we describe 
the phases of computation and discuss the role 
of WordNet in making accentability decisions. 
Finally, we present sample output of the system, 
explore areas for improvement, and summarize 
our results. 
2 Semant ic  and  D iscourse  E f fects  on 
In tonat ion  
The effects of "givenness" on the accentabil- 
ity of lexical items has been examined in 
some detail and has led to the development of
intonation algorithms for both text-to-speech 
(Hirschberg, 1990; Hirschberg, 1993; Mon- 
aghan, 1991; Terken and Hirschberg, 1994) and 
concept-to-speech systems (Monaghan, 1994). 
While the strategy of accenting open-class items 
on first mention often produces appropriate 
and natural-sounding intonation in synthesized 
speech, such algorithms fail to account for cer- 
tain accentual patterns that occur with some 
regularity in natural speech, such as items ac- 
cented to mark an explicit contrast among 
the salient discourse ntities. In addition, the 
given/new distinction alone does not seem to 
account for the variation among accent ypes 
found in natural speech. 2 Unfortunately, such 
issues have been difficult to resolve for text- 
to-speech because of the paucity of semantic 
a.nd discourse-level information readily available 
without sophisticated text understanding algo- 
rithms and robust knowledge representations. 
Previous CTS work (Prevost, 1995; Prevost, 
1996; Prevost and Steedman, 1994) showed that 
both contrastive accentual patterns and lim- 
ited pitch accent variation could be modeled 
in a spoken language generation system. The 
present work incorporates these results in a

|.ion may be at issue here. The relationship of accent 
types to the given/new taxonomy proposed by (Prince, 
\[981) may warrant more xploration i  a computational

text-to-speech system, using a similar represen- 
tation for discourse context (i.e. information 
structure), and replacing the domain-specific 
knowledge base with WordNet. 
We represent local discourse context using a 
two-tiered information structure framework. In 
the higher tier, propositions are divided into 
theme and rheme. The theme represents what 
the proposition is about and provides the con- 
textual link to prior utterances. The rheme 
provides the core contribution of the proposi- 
tion to the discourse--the material the listener 
is unlikely to predict from context. In the sim- 
plest case, where an utterance conveys a single 
proposition, the division into theme and rheme 
is often straightforward, as shown in the ques- 
tion/answer pair in Figure 1. 
(Steedman, 1991) and (Prevost and Steed- 
man, 1994) argue that for the class of utter- 
ances exemplified by these examples, the rheme 
of the utterance often occurs with an intona- 
tional (intermediate) phrase carrying the H* L- 
L% (H* L-) tune, while the theme, when it 
bears any marked intonational features, often 
carries the L-t-H* L-L?~ (L-I-H* L-) tune. 
While this mapping of thematic constituents 
onto intonational tunes is certainly an oversim- 
plification, it has been quite useful in previ- 
ous concept-to-speech work. We are currently 
using the Boston University radio news cor- 
pus (Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel, 
1995) to compile statistics to support our use of 
this mapping. 3 Preliminary results show that 
the H* accent is most prevalent, occurring 
more than fifty percent of the time. !H* and 
L--t-H* occur less frequently than H*, but more 
than any of the other possible accents. We take 
the prevalence ofH* and L-t-H* in the corpus 
to support our decision to focus on these accent 
types. 
Given the mapping of tunes onto thematic 
and rhematic phrases, one must still determine 
which items within those phrases are to be ac- 
cented. We consider such items to be in theme- 
or rheme-focus, the secondary tier of our in-

(Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994) intonation 
markings.

formation structure representation, as shown in 
Figure 1. The determination of focused items 
is based on both givenness and contrastiveness. 
For the current TTS task, we consider items to 
be in focus on first mention and whenever Word- 
Net finds a contrasting item in the current dis- 
course segment. The algorithm for determining 
the contrast sets is described in Section 4 below. 
The adaptation of an information structure 
approach to the TTS task highlights a num- 
ber of important issues. First, while it may be 
convenient to think of the division into theme 
and theme in terms of utterances, it may be 
more appropriate to consider the division in 
terms of propositions. Complex utterances may 
contain a number of clauses conveying sev- 
eral propositions and consequently more than 
one theme/rheme s gmentation. Our program 
annotates thematic and rhematic stretches of 
text by first trying to locate propositional con- 
stituents, as described in Section 4. 
Another information structure issue brought 
to fight by the TTS task is that themes may 
not consist solely of background material, but 
may also include inferable items, as shown in 
example (1). In this example, "name" is cer- 
tainly not part of the shared background be- 
tween the speaker and the listener. However, 
since it is common knowledge that pets have 
names, it serves as a coherent thematic rink to 
the previous utterance. 4

to account for a complex relationship like this one. 
3 The  WordNet  Lex ica l  Database  
WordNet is a large on-fine Engfish lexical 
database, based on theories of human lexical 
memory and comprised of four part-of-speech 
categories: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and ad- 
verbs (Miller et al, 1993). Within each cate- 
gory, lexical meaning is represented by synonym 
sets (synsets) organized around semantic rela- 
tionships. Polysemous words are represented by
multiple synsets, one for each word sense. The 
release used in this work, WordNet 1.5, con- 
tains a total of 91,591 synsets and 168,135 word 
senses (Miller, 1995). 
Types of semantic relationships between 
synsets vary by category. The basic structure 
of each is discussed briefly below. 
3.0 .1  Nouns 
The nouns category is the largest and se- 
mantically richest of the four. It contains 
60,557 synsets, grouped into 25 different op- 
ical hierarchies. Synsets in each hierar- 
chy are organized using hypernymy/hyponymy 
(IS-A) relationships. The noun hierarchies 
also include antonymy and three types of 
meronymy/holonymy relationships (PART-OF, 
MEMBER-OF, MADE-OF). Meronyms are 
typically defined at the level of basic concepts 
in the hierarchies. 
3.0 .2  Verbs 
Verbs currently comprise 11,363 synsets in 
WordNet, divided into 15 categories based on 
semantic riteria. The primary semantic rela- 
tionships for verbs in WordNet are lexical entail- 
ment (e.g. snoring ENTAILS sleeping) and hy- 
pernomy/hyponymy. Verb hierarchies also in- 
49 
clude troponymy (MANNER-OF) relationships, 
and to a. lesser extent, antonymy and causM 
relationships. Generally, verb hierarchies are 
much shallower with higher branching factors 
than noun hierarchies, but like nouns, verbs ex- 
hibit basic concept levels at which most tro- 
ponyms are defined. 
3.0.3 Ad ject ives  
WordNet contains 16,428 synsets of adjectives 
divided into descriptive and relational types, 
and a small closed-class of reference-modifying 
adjectives. Descriptive adjectives are organized 
around antonymy, and relational adjectives ac- 
cording to the nouns to which they pertain. 
WordNet alo encodes limitations on syntactic 
positions that specific adjectives can occupy. 
3.0.4 Adverbs  
Adverbs make up the smallest of the four cat- 
egories, with a total of 3243 synsets. Adverbs 
are organized by antonymy and similarity rela- 
tionships. 
4 Imp lementat ion  
An overview of the system architecture is 
shown in Figure 2. Following (Cahn, 1994; 
Cahn, 1997), text files are first parsed by the 
NPtool noun phrase parser, which identifies 
noun phrases and tags each word with morpho- 
logical, syntactic, and part-of-speech informa- 
tion (Voutilainen, 1993). The preliminary pro- 
cessing module then adds gender information 
for proper names, resolves ambiguous tags, and 
reformats the text for further processing. ~ Next, 
the previous mention, contrast, and theme mod- 
ules assign pitch accents, phrase accents, and 
boundary tones, using WordNet to identify sets 
of synonyms and contrastive words. Finally, the 
annotated text is re-formatted for the TrueTalk 
speech synthesizer (Entropic Research Labora- 
tory, 1995). Additional implementation details 
for the accent assignment modules are provided 
below. 
SGender resohition is performed via simple lookup 
using the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository Name 
Corpus (l(antrowitz, 1994). Ambiguous parses are re- 
solved using a set of heuristics derived from analysis of 
NPtool output. 
4.1 G ivenness  Ident i f icat ion 
The first of the three accent assignment mod- 
ules assigns .pitch accents to words using the 
following given/new strategy: 
For each word W, 
1. If W is a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, 
and W ? history(),  and W ? equiv(x), for 
any x E history( ): 
(a) tag W as a focused item 
(b) add W to history( ) 
(c) create equiv(W) 
2. If W is a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, 
and W E equiv(x), tag W as inferable. 6 
The history and equivalence lists are reset at 
each paragraph boundary. Matches are limited 
to words belonging to the same part-of-speech 
category, relying only on word roots. 
Equivalence (synonym) sets are created from 
semantic relationships for each WordNet cate- 
gory as follows: 
1. Nouns: equiv(W) = union of hypernyms 
and synonyms for all synsets of W. The 
number of hypernym levels used for each 
sense is determined by searching for the ex- 
istence of meronyms on the current level, 
climbing the hypernym tree until a level 
containing meronyms is found, or the root 
is reached. If no meronyms are found, then 
(1/4 ? depth of W synset) levels are used. 7
2. Verbs: equiv(W) = union of hypernyms, 
synonyms, and entailments for all synsets 
of W. Only one level of hypernyms i
included.S 
3. Adjectives and adverbs: equiv(W) = syn- 
onyms for all synsets of W. 
6Items tagged as inferable by this step are realized 
by less prominent pitch accents than items tagged as 
focused, reflecting their status as not explicitly given. 
~The present approach to identifying a "basic" con- 
cept level for nouns using meronymic relations is not the 
optimal solution. Many noun categories in WordNet do 
not include meronyms, and meronyms may exist at sev: 
eral levels within a hierarchy. 
8 Because verb hierarchies have a much higher branch- 
ing factor, considering more than one level is generally 
impractical.

Equivalence lists are ordered and searched 
from most common to least common sense of a 
word. The current implementation is limited to 
single word matches; no WordNet entries con- 
sisting of multi-word descriptions are included 
in the equivalence list. 
4.2 Cont ras t ive  Stress  Ass ignment  
The second accent assignment module compares 
each open-class word (nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
and adverbs) with other words previously real- 
ized in the text to identify possible contrastive 
relationships. The top-level algorithm for as- 
signing contrastive stress is shown in pseudo- 
code in Figure 3. 
Sets of possible contrastive words for nouns 
and verbs are determined by the hyper- 
nym/hyponym relationships in WordNet as fol- 
lows: 
. 
. 
. 
Identify the set of immediate hypernyms, 
hyper(W), corresponding to each sense of 
W (synsets containing W). 
For each h: h E hyper(W), identify the 
set of immediate hyponyms, hypo(h), such 
that W e hypo(h). 
The set of possible contrastive words is the 
union of hyponyms for each sense of W. 
The contrastive sets for adjectives and ad- 
verbs are simply the union of antonyms for all 
foreach word W1 { 
for each word W2 on the history list 
(from most to least recent) { 
for each A: A E contrast(W2) {
if W1 equals A then { 
tag W1 for contrastive stress; 
end search; 
} 
} 
} 
if no contrast is found { 
add W1 to the history list; 
generate &: store {x:  x E contrast(W1)}; 
} 
} 
Figure 3: Contrastive Stress Assignment 
word senses, as hypernym/hyponym relation- 
ships are not used in WordNet for either class. 
All contrastive sets generated are ordered and 
searched from the most common to least com- 
mon sense of a word. The present implementa- 
tion is limited to single word searches. 
There are a number of shortcomings in the 
present implementation of contrastive stress as- 
signment. The first is its failure to use tex- 
tual information to facilitate identification of 
contrastive relationships. To rectify this sit- 
uation, a search for keywords commonly used 
to indicate contrast (e.g. however, unlike, on- 
51 
the-other-hand), as well as explicit negation 
(not) must be incorporated. Identifying parallel 
phrasing may also be useful in identifying con- 
trastive relationships not encoded in WordNet 
(namely for non-antonymic ontrasts between 
adjectives and adverbs). 
4.3 Theme ~ Rheme Ident i f i cat ion  
The modules described above determine the sec- 
ond tier of the information structure--that is, 
which items are eligible for focus based on their 
new or contrastive status. The theme/rheme 
identification module is responsible for deter- 
mining the primary information structure de- 
lineation of theme and rheme. Based on an au- 
tomatic segmentation of utterances or parts of 
utterances into theme and rheme, we can apply 
the mapping of tunes described in Section 2 to 
decide which pitch accents to assign and where 
to place phrasal and boundary tones. 
The automatic segmentation of utterances 
into theme and rheme is a difficult problem. 
Our preliminary approach is based on a num- 
ber of heuristics, and generally performs quite 
well. Nonetheless, we expect this module to 
be substantially refined once we have concluded 
our empirical analysis of the Boston Univer- 
sity radio news corpus (Ostendorf, Price, and 
Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1995). 
The theme/rheme identification algorithm 
begins by trying to identify propositional con- 
stituents within utterances. As noted in Sec- 
tion 2, a single utterance may contain sev- 
eral clauses corresponding to several seman- 
tic propositions. Propositional constituents are 
centered around verb occurrences. The al- 
gorithm looks for verb complexes--contiguous 
stretches of text containing verbs, adverbs and 
some prepositions. Utterances are then divided 
into propositional constituents uch that each 
contains a single verb complex. The algorithm 
also considers multi-word clauses that are set 
apart by punctuation, such as utterance-initial 
prepositional phrases, as separate propositional 
constituents. 9 This segmentation scheme is sim- 
9Note that we work with the part-of-speech output 
of NPtool rather than a complete parse tree. While this 
presents a number of diffictflties for dividing utterances 
ilar to Gussenhoven's division of utterances into 
focus domains (Gussenhoven, 1983). 
Once propositional constituents have been 
determined, the algorithm applies a number of 
heuristics to sub-divide each into theme and 
rheme. We consider two possible segmentation 
points: before the verb-complex and after the 
verb-complex. The heuristics are as follows, 
where PreV, V and PostV correspond to the 
pre-verbal material, the verb-complex material 
and the post-verbal material respectively. 
1. In the case where neither PreV, V nor 
PostV contains focused items: 
theme = \[PreV\] 
rheme = \[V PostV\] 
Accent V material. 
2. If PreV and V contain focused items, but 
PostV does not: 
theme = \[PreV\] 
rheme = \[V PostV\] 
3. If PreV and PostV contain focused items, 
but V does not: 
theme = \[PreV V\] 
rheme = \[PostV\] 
4. If V and PostV contain focused items, but 
PreV does not: 
theme = \[PreV V\] 
rheme = \[PostV\] 
5. If PreV, V and PostV all contain focused 
items: 
theme = \[PreV V\] 
rheme = \[PostV\] 
6. If PreV contains focused items, but V and 
PostV do not: 
rheme = \[PreV\] 
theme = \[V PostV\] 
7. If V contains focused items, but PreV and 
PostV do not: 
theme = \[PreV\] 
rheme = \[V PostV\] 
into propositional constituents, it allows us more free- 
dom in sub-dividing those propositional constituents into 
theme and rheme. That is, our program can produce 
prosodic phrases, such as those shown in Figure 1, that 
are orthogonal to traditional syntactic structures. 
52 
8. If PostV contains focused items, but PreV 
and V do not: 
theme = \[PreV V\] 
rheme = \[PostV\] 
Note that these heuristics encode a prefer- 
ence tbr thematic phrases to precede rhematic 
phrases, but do not always dictate such an or- 
dering. Also, note that the heuristics allow 
thematic phrases to sometimes contain focused 
items. This is in accordance with our observa- 
tion in Section 2 that themes need not contain 
only background material. 
Based on the theme/rheme identification 
heuristics, we map L-t-H* accents onto focused 
items in themes and H* accents onto focused 
items in rhemes. L- phrasal tones are placed 
at theme and rheme boundaries. When theme 
or rheme phrases are also marked by punctu- 
ation, appropriate boundary tones and pauses 
are also inserted (e.g. H% for comma delim- 
ited phrases). 
5 Resu l ts  and  Conc lus ions  
The system was designed and debugged using 
a set of five single-paragraph texts. It was then 
tested using several new single-paragraph texts, 
excerpted from news articles and encyclopedia 
entries. Sample output is shown in Figures 4 
and 5, where prominence, defined as a multiplier 
of the default nuclear accent, is shown directly 
below the associated pitch accent. 
These preliminary test results indicate us- 
ing information structure in conjunction with 
WordNet can produce intonational patterns 
with context-appropriate variation in pitch 
accent type and prominence. In general, 
LWH* accents occur on items deemed to be 
thematic, and H* accents occur on rhematic 
items. WordNet proved to be fairly success- 
\[ul at identifying words which were "given" via 
inference, thus allowing the program to cor- 
rectly reduce the pitch accent prominence as- 
signed to these words. For example, in Figure 4, 
the prominence of the pitch accent on "achieve- 
ment" is lowered because of its relationship to 
"feat." In Figure 5, the prominence of the ac- 
cent on "soil" is lowered because of its relation- 
ship to "ground." To a lesser extent, Word- 
Net was also able to identify appropriate con- 
trastive relationships, uch as the relationship 
between "difficult" and "easy" in Figure 5. Con- 
sequently, our program places a slightly more 
prominent accent on "difficult" than it would 
have if "easy" had not occurred within the same 
segment. 
While quite encouraging, these preliminary 
results have also identified many opportunities 
for improvement. The current implementation 
is limited by the absence of a full parse tree. 
It is also limited by the current heuristic ap- 
proach to phrase segmentation, and therefore 
often produces L- phrasal tones in improper 
places. Substituting better tools for both pars- 
ing and phrase segmentation would improve the 
overall performance. 
The system's accuracy level for WordNet syn- 
onym and contrast identification can be im- 
proved in two ways: by incorporating word 
sense disambiguation, and by using a more so- 
phisticated approach for generating a "match." 
Presently, WordNet results are searched in order 
of most common to least common word senses, 
thus biasing matches towards common word 
senses, rather than determining the most likely 
context. Incorporating a sense disambiguation 
algorithm, such as that discussed in (R.esnik, 
1995), is a logical next step. Word matches are 
also limited to comparisons between individual 
words within a single l~art-of-speech ategory. 
Extending consideration to adjacent words and 
semantic roles would greatly reduce the number 
of spurious matches generated by the system. 
Another area for improvement concerns the 
prominence of pitch accents. Based on our pre- 
liminary results, we believe that the L-t-H* ac- 
cents should be somewhat lower than those 
shown in Figures 4 and 5. Once we have 
completed our analysis of the Boston Univer- 
sity radio news corpus (Ostendorf, Price, and 
Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1995), we expect o modify 
the accent prominences based on our findings. 
Our assessment of system performance is
based on human listeners qualitative measure- 
ments of the "comprehensibility" of output from 
our system in comparison with the standard

ers reading the same text.
