Abstract 
This paper is a contribution to the issue ? 
which has, in  the course of the last decade, 
become critical ? of the basic requirements 
and validation criteria for lexical language 
resources in Standard Arabic. The work is 
based on a critical analysis of the architecture 
of the DIINAR.1 lexical database, the entries 
of which are associated with grammar-lexis 
relations operating at word-form level (i.e. in 
morphological analysis). Investigation shows a 
crucial difference, in the concept of ?lexical 
database?, between source program and 
generated lexica. The source program un-
derlying DIINAR.1 is analysed, and some fig-
ures and ratios are presented. The original 
categorisations are, in the course of scrutiny, 
partly revisited. Results and ratios given here 
for basic entries on the one hand, and for 
generated lexica of inflected word-forms on 
the other. They aim at giving a first answer to 
the question of the ratios between the number 
of lemma-entries and inflected word-forms 
that can be expected to be included in, or 
generated by, a Standard Arabic lexical dB. 
These ratios can be considered as one overall 
language-specific criterion for the analysis, 
evaluation and validation of lexical dB-s in 
Arabic. 
 
Keywords: Arabic lexical databases ? Arabic 
script ? word-formatives grammar ? lemma-
entries ? morphosyntactic specifiers. 
1 Introduction 
In the present state of the art in the development 
of software and language resources in Arabic, there 
is an urgent need for evaluation and validation 
criteria based on solid analytic grounds: there ex-
ists nowadays a subsequent number of Arabic lexi-
cal databases, and more are under completion.  
Existing lexical dB-s are not always, for the time 
being, available as such to researchers and/or de-
velopers, because they are usually embedded in 
software (such as a morphological analyser or a 
parser), and are still very difficult to make use of 
independently. It is to be expected, though, that the 
issue of availability will be overcome in a reasona-
bly near future, and that a number of Arabic lexical 
databases will be found on the market, or on cata-
logues such as, in Europe, that of ELRA1, and in 
the USA, that of LDC2. The on-going European 
project NEMLAR is presently working on the 
availability of language resources including lexical 
databases3. As a result, the crucial question of the 
quality and consistency of these databases should 
be met as soon as possible.

One of the criteria for the evaluation and valida-
tion of a lexical database for Arabic is both quan-
titative (how many?) and qualitative (what of, 
precisely?). In this paper, which refers to previous 
work on the processing of Arabic and the related 
lexical resources4, we will try and give evidence on 
the structure of a lexical database, founded on an 
analysis of the DIINAR.1 database5. Quantitative 
results are only interesting if they can be inter-
preted in such a way as to yield information on the 
actual structure and categories of the lexicon of the 
language under consideration. We will endeavour 
to show that a quantitative and qualitative analysis 
of the lexical categories incorporated in DIINAR.1 
can be interpreted with this respect. Moreover, the 
investigation leads to proposing a more consistent 
organisation of lexical information and relations, 
which should be included in future versions of 
DIINAR. 
2 The type of lexical dB required by the auto-
matic analysis of Arabic 
What are the fundamental requirements of a 
lexical database in Arabic? The first challenge to 
be met upon endeavouring to build language re-
sources in Arabic is that of the structure of the 
writing system of the language (Dichy, 1990), the 
two main features of which are: non diacriticized 
script in standard texts (? 2.1) and the structure of 
the word-form (? 2.2). The combined effect of 
these features entails the need for a lexical data-
base that includes a subsequent number of gram-
mar-lexis relations (? 2.3). Such a dB is to be 
considered as a sine qua non condition of high-
level and elaborate Arabic NLP.

 The research and development work referred to in 
the SILAT research group goes back to the 1980ies and 
has been going on since (Descl?s et ali 1983, Dichy & 
Hassoun, eds. 1989, Dichy 1984/89, 1987, 1993, 1997, 
2000, Lelubre 1993, Braham 1998, Braham & Ghazali 
1998). It includes a number of doctoral dissertations 
(Hassoun 1987, Abu Al-Chay 1988, Dichy, 1990, Gader 
1992, Ghenima 1998). For further developments, see:

DIINAR.1
 (DIctionnaire INformatis? de l?Arabe), 
Arabic acronym Ma??l? (?Mu?jam al-?Arabiyya l-??l??), 
is a comprehensive Arabic Language dB operating at 
word-form level (morphological analysis or generation). 
It has been completed in close cooperation, in Tunis by 
IRSIT (now SOTETEL-IT - A. Braham and S. Ghazali), 
and in France by ENSSIB (M. Hassoun) and the 
Lumi?re-Lyon 2 University (J. Dichy). See Dichy, 
Braham, Ghazali & Hassoun, 2002.  
2.1 Non diacriticized writing 
It is well-known that Arabic script belongs to a 
group of Semitic writings originating from ancient 
Phoenician alphabets, such as Hebrew, Aramaic or 
Syriac. Phonographic translation is basically re-
stricted to the notation of consonants and ?long 
vowels?. In the course of time, these writing sys-
tems have developed additional diacritic symbols, 
mainly for the needs of the oral reading of sacred 
texts (Bible, New Testament, Koran). Arabic writ-
ing has thus been provided with a sophisticated 
system of diacritical marks (comparable to the 
Massora diacritics which were later devised for the 
Hebrew Bible). Standard writing nevertheless dis-
regards these symbols. This results in a high de-
gree of homography, accounting for the multiple 
analyses encountered in a majority of single words 
by morphological analysers (which are, needless to 
recall, bound to consider every word off-context). 
 
2.2 ?Nucleus? and ?extensions?: a quick re-
call of the structure of word-forms in 
written Arabic 
Unlike automatic recognition software, human 
readers are, of course, able to combine semantic, 
syntactic and morphological analyses. They are 
helped in their reading of Arabic written utterances 
by another major feature of the writing system: the 
very regular structure of the word-form. This 
structure has been introduced and extensively de-
scribed previously (Descl?s ed., 1983; Dichy 1984, 
1990; Hassoun, 1987 ? after the pioneering work 
of Cohen, 1961/70), and is only recalled here for 
the sake of clarity. 
Word-forms in Arabic can be described on the 
whole as consisting of a nucleus formative (hence-
forth NF) to which extension formatives (hence-
forth EF) are added, either to the left or to the right 
(Dichy, 1997). Ante-positioned EF-s are abbrevi-
ated as aEF, and post-positioned ones as pEF. The 
nucleus formative, usually called stem, can be rep-
resented in terms of prosodic or non-concatenative 
morphology (after J. McCarthy?s original and 
much discussed insights, 1981). In Semitic mor-
phology, the stem is considered, according to a 
somewhat recent, but very widely followed tradi-
tion, as a compound of root and pattern. One must 
keep in mind, though, that many nouns cannot be 
analysed in such a way: they are referred to as 
quasi-stems (Dichy & Hassoun, eds., 1989).  
Arabic word-forms consist of:  
? proclitics (PCL), which include mono-consonan-
tal conjunctions, e.g. wa-, ?and? , li-, ?in order 
to?, or  prepositions, i.e. bi-, ?in, at? or ?by?, etc.;  
? a prefix (PRF). The category, after D. Cohen?s 
representation of the word-form, only includes 
the prefixes of the imperfective, e.g., ya-, pre-
fixed morpheme of the 3rd person;  
? a stem, which can be represented in terms of a 
ROOT (an ordered triple of consonants, or, by 
extension of the system, a quadruple) and a 
PATTERN (roughly: a template of syllables, the 
consonants of which are the triple of the ROOT to 
which monoconsonantal affixes are added). The 
stem takabbar, ?to be haughty?, thus consists of 
the 3-consonant ROOT /k-b-r/ and of the 
PATTERN /taR1aR2R2aR3/, where R1, R2 and R3 
stand for ?radical consonant 1, 2, 3?, and are in-
stantiated by the triple of the ROOT (R1=k, R2=b, 
R3=r). Nouns that cannot be analysed in ROOT 
and PATTERN are conventionally referred to as 
quasi-stems, e.g.: ?ism???l, ?Ishmael?, y?n?sk?, 
?UNESCO?, kahram?n, ?amber?;  
? suffixes (SUF), such as verb endings, nominal 
cases, the nominal feminine ending -at, etc.;  
? enclitics (ECL). In Arabic, enclitics are comple-
ment pronouns. 
 
In the table below two apparently equivalent rep-
resentations of the structure of the Arabic word-
form are given. The main difference between them 
lies in the fact that (2) aims at highlighting the 
relations between nucleus and extension forma-
tives (NF and EF-s), featuring a triangle (in bold-
face below). The rules governing the relations 
between morphemes embedded in the word-form 
are included in a word-formatives grammar 
(henceforth WFG ? Dichy, 1987, 1997). These 
rules, and the features they involve, are distributed 
along these three relations, a great number of 
which are related to the lexical nucleus, and have 
to rely upon the finite set of grammar-lexis rela-
tions operating at word-level (formalised in Dichy, 
1990).

Table 1: Structure of the word-form in Arabic 
2.3 Word-formatives grammar (WFG) and 
word-level grammar-lexis relations 
Complex as it may appear, the above structure is 
regular, and remains, up to a certain point, 
recognisable from a psychological stand. It is, 
subsequently, very restrictive: Arabic word-forms 
include one lexical stem and one only6. In fact, the 
word-formatives grammar (WFG) accounts for the 
regular structure of the word-form.  
Rules involving word-formatives (the above nu-
cleus and extension formatives, NF and EF) are 
based on three fundamental types of relations 
(Dichy, 1987):   ?entails?, ?> ?excludes?, ** ?is 
compatible with? (or ?admits?), the third of which 
is attached to the opposed pair of the first two as an 
?elsewhere? relation of a special kind, directly 
connected to ambiguity in language analysis 
processes (Dichy, 2000). In generation, all 
?compatibility? (or ?admit?) relations can in fact be 
rewritten in terms of ?entail? or ?exclude? rules 
associated with specific sets of word-formatives. 
?Compatibility? relations are mostly useful in the 
formalisation of recognition rules, when ambiguity 
is at stake7. The formal structure of the WFG thus 
includes relations of the three types above, which 
are, in turn, involved in either one of the two 
following combination schemes: 
 

 EF  EF combinations, such as PCL ? SUF 
rules, e.g.:  
 PCL = bi     SUF = {i, in, a, an, ?na, ?, ayni, ay} 
 which can be phrased as: ?the proclitic preposi-
tion bi# entails one of the indirect (or genitive) 
case suffixes?. Other rules will point to a given 
case suffix in a given utterance.  
 

 NF  EF combinations, such as STEM ? SUF 
rules, e.g.:  
STEM = ?diptote?    SUF = {u, a, i} 
 which can be phrased as: ?a stem whose declen-
sion is diptote entails case-endings belonging to 
the listed set?. (Diptote stems may also be com-
patible with dual or plural suffixes, which is 
taken into account in another rule.) 
 
Another type of relation to be encoded in a lexi-
cal database is: 
                                                     
6
. A few exceptive compound items exist, but they are 
kept marginal by the structure of the language, for the 
obvious reasons hinted at here, unlike what has hap-
pened in Modern Hebrew, as opposed to the Biblical 
and Medieval state of the language (Kirtchuk, 1997). 
7
. Automatic recognition and generation are not to be 
considered as reverse processes. Evidence from Arabic 
is given in Descl?s, ed., 1983; Dichy, 1984, 1997, 2000. 
 NF  NF linking combinations, which have to 
be encoded whenever the morphological varia-
tion is not rule-predictable (cf. Mel uk?s concept 
of syntactic, 1982). This is the case in a majority 
of singular  ?broken plural? links in nouns or 
adjectives, as well as in ?perfec-
tive?  ?imperfective? (m?d?  mud?ri?) links, 
in verbs belonging to ?simple? PATTERNS (al-fi?l 
al-mujarrad).  
 
In an Arabic lexical dB, lexical entries (NF-s or 
STEMS in the above representation) need to be as-
sociated with morphosyntactic specifiers ensuring 
their insertion in word-forms, and their morpho-
logical variation (conjugation or declension). Mor-
phosyntactic specifiers, in other words, account 
for: 
? grammar-lexis relations, i.e. NF  EF combina-
tions; 
? morpho-lexical variation, i.e. NF  NF linking 
combinations. 
 
Lexical entries thus ?entail?, ?exclude? or ?admit? 
a number of grammatical morphemes listed in the 
various fields of the word-form as word-forma-
tives, either on a non regular basis, or on the basis 
of rules founded on semantic features that cannot 
be deduced from the formal structure of the mor-
pheme. As shown in Dichy (1997), morphosyntac-
tic specifiers make up formally, in a lexical 
database, for information associated in the 
speaker?s memory to various levels of linguistic 
analysis (morpho-phonological, syntactic or se-
mantic features). 
This structure has often been disregarded in the 
elaboration of Arabic lexical databases on the as-
sumption that the representation of lexical entries 
as a mere combination of PATTERN and ROOT (plus 
a number of suffixes) is sufficient. This is defi-
nitely not the case: evidence recalled in this para-
graph (also in Hassoun & Dichy, eds. 1989, Dichy, 
1997, Dichy & Fergaly, 2003) show that grammar-
lexis relations operating at word-form level can 
only be taken into account if information is associ-
ated to whole stems (or nuclei), or to stem+suffix 
?frozen? compounds. These relations cannot be 
predicted on the sole basis of patterns. 
The description of the WFG outlined in this 
paragraph has led to the elaboration of exhaustive 
and finite sets of morphosyntactic specifiers liable 
to be associated to the non finite lexical entries of 
an Arabic database (Dichy, 1997). These sets have 
been associated with the entries of the DIINAR.1 
Arabic Language database. The WFG has been on 
the other hand implemented in the related genera-
tion and analysis source programs.  
 
Another lexical LR including morphosyntactic 
information at word level is the lexicon elaborated 
and completed by Timothy Buckwalter, which has 
been used in the finite-state morphological analy-
ser elaborated at the European Xerox Research 
Centre (Meylan, France)8. 
3 A few figures and ratios from DIINAR.1: 
generated lexica vs. source lexicon 
In the previous section, we outlined the structure 
of the WFG and the information associated with 
lexical entries in the source program of the 
DIINAR.1 database.  
It is essential to note that the expression lexical 
database is ambiguous, i.e. that it is liable to refer, 
either: 
? to a source program drawing on lists of basic 
lexical or grammatical items (related to a gram-
mar of the kind outlined in the previous section), 
? or a set of generated lexica, the items of which 
can be either basic (as in the source program) or 
combined, i.e. resulting from the combination of 
basic items, according to the rules of the word-
formatives grammar. 
 
Software relying partly or entirely on morpho-
logical analysis may, or may not, need all the in-
formation outlined in section 2. They draw on 
lexica generated by the source program associated 
with the dB (Hassoun, 1987). Generated lexica can 
be restricted to a subset of information, as in a 
spelling checker (Gader, 1992), or extended to all 
available information, as in a parser (Ouersighni, 
2002) or in an interactive language teaching soft-
ware (Zaafrani, 2002). In the current section, we 
will examine the architecture of the DIINAR.1 
database, from the standpoint of the relation be-
tween the figures of the basic entries included 
(? 3.1 and 3.2), and that of the inflected word-
forms (? 3.3). 
 
3.1 The basic figures of the DIINAR.1 source 
program 
The total number of lemma-entries in the 
DIINAR.1 database is : 121,522. 
This includes 445 tool-words belonging to vari-
ous grammatical categories (e.g.: prepositions, 
conjunctions, etc.) and the prototype of a proper 
names database of 1,384 entries. Both types of 
entries are associated with a particular word-for-
matives grammar, and with their own subsets of 
morpho-syntactic specifiers. 
The main parts of the database include:

3.2 Comments and critical analysis 
(1)  
Table 2 features two ratios of general interest for 
the structure of the Arabic general Lexicon:  
? The ratio between broken plural nominal forms 
(which are not counted as lemmas9) and nouns 
and adjectives is roughly of one to four. 
? Deverbals appear to be 3.6 more numerous than 
verbs. 
 
(2) 
The above categorisation follows that of tradi-
tional Arabic grammar. Two sub-categorisations 
should, nevertheless be revisited for linguistic con-
sistency reasons:  
? Adjectives (although they can appear as nouns in 
many syntactic structures) should be isolated. 
This will be needed, of course, in parsing ? even 
in ?shallow parsing?. Adjectives in Arabic can be 
identified through syntactic tests. 
? ?Nouns of time and place? (?asm??u l-mak?n wa-
z-zam?n) should not, in future versions of 
DIINAR, remain in the ?deverbal? category. 
They are in fact (except for the earliest stages in 
the development of the language) inserted in 
syntactic structures as full nouns. 
 
(3) 
It is to be noted, on the other hand, that (except 
for ?nouns of time and place?) DIINAR.1 is very 
consistent in distinguishing between nouns and 
deverbals: deverbals re-used as nouns, and 
showing full nominal features appear, in the dB,

related morphosyntactic specifiers), e.g.: 
? s?kin, plur. s?kin?n, s?kin?t, ?dwelling?, 
?inhabiting?, is a deverbal, e.g.:  
 Nahnu s?kin?na mad?nata al-?iskandariyya = 
?We live in Alexandria?. 
? s?kin, plur. sukkn (broken plural form), ?inhabi-
tant?, is a full noun (appearing in the first line of 
Table 2), e.g.:  
 Nahnu sukk?nu mad?nati l-?iskandariyya = ?We 
are the inhabitants of Alexandria?. 
 
(4) 
The number of roots in DIINAR.1 is 6,546, it 
being understood that a great many nouns cannot 
be analysed in ROOT and PATTERN. (On the other 
hand, all the verbs and deverbals of the language 
can ? Dichy, 1984/89.) 
 
3.3 The DIINAR.1 lexica of inflected word-
forms 
The number of combined proclitics (which are 
effectively in use in Modern Standard Arabic), 
suffixes, prefixes and enclitics is shown in the ta-
bles below:

Table 4: EF-s associated with nominal and/or 
verbal stems 
It is easy to imagine, on the basis of the above 
table, that one could generate huge figures through 
multiplying the number of extension formatives 
among themselves, then multiplying the result by 
the number of nouns and/or verbs. In order to 
avoid ?over-powerful? inflation of data, a consis-
tent database needs to be filtered through (a) a 
word-formatives grammar and (b) morphosyntactic 
specifiers associated to stems.

One can also compare the ratio between the total 
number of stems and that of inflected forms to 
what can be found in another language, which is 
equally known to be a highly inflected one. The 
Xerox Spanish Lexical Transducer contained, in 
1996 over 46,000 base-forms, and generated over 
3,400,000 inflected word-forms (Beesley & 
Karttunen, 2003, p. xvii). The ratio between 
inflected forms and base-forms in the Xerox 
Spanish database was then of around 74 to one. In 
the DIINAR.1 dB, the same ratio is of just under 
60 to one, which can be considered as reasonable. 
The question of how many ?maximal word? 
forms can be correctly generated remains to be 
introduced and discussed in a further paper. 
4 The rationale beyond ratios: towards a first 
set of validation criteria for Arabic lexica 
The ratios considered in the present paper are di-
vided in two general categories: 
 
? The category encountered in ? 3.2 involves 
NF  NF linking combinations (? 2.3):  
(a) The ratio between the number of noun lem-
mas (in general vocabulary) and that of ?bro-
ken plurals? is of 1 ?broken plural? for every 
4 nouns. 
(b) The overall ratio between verbs and 
deverbals gives an average of 3.6 deverbals 
for one verb. 
 
? The ratios given in ? 3.3 and 3.4 consider the 
number of basic entries, such as nouns, verbs, 
deverbals, etc., and the inflected forms generated 
through the rules of the WFG and the grammar-
lexis relations specifiers included in the dB. In 
nouns, the relatively high ratio of 45.55 is due to 
the combination of case-endings with other suf-
fixes. In proper names, case-endings are limited, 
because they do not vary according to definite-
ness or indefiniteness, and also because some 
categories of proper names are in addition not 
liable to be followed by the relative suffix ?iyy). 
 
In this contribution, the numbers of lemma-en-
tries reflect the state of the DIINAR.1 database, 
which is likely to be modified, in the course of 
time, through eliminating lemmas corresponding to 
words that have fallen out of use or through adding 
new entries. Ratios, on the other hand, reflect the 
word-formatives grammar as well as the overall 
structure of the sets of morpho-syntactic specifiers 
associated to lexical entries. They are, on he 
whole, to remain stable. It is therefore reasonable 
to consider that they should be added to the 
language-specific parts of a check-list devised for 
the evaluation and validation of Arabic lexical 
resources, or of multilingual lexica including 
Arabic.
