Compositionality and Multiword Expressions: Six of One, Half a
Dozen of the Other?
Timothy Baldwin
Melbourne University
In this talk, I will investigate the relationship between compositionality and multiword expressions,
as part of which I will outline different approaches for formalising the notion of compositionality. I will
then briefly review computational methods that have been proposed for modelling compositionality, and
applications thereof. Finally, I will discuss possible future directions for modelling compositionality, and
present some preliminary results.
