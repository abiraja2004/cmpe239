1 INTRODUCTION 
Phase III of the T IPSTER project included three 
workshops for evaluating document detection (infor- 
mation retrieval) projects: the fifth, sixth and sev- 
enth Text REtrieval Conferences (TRECs). This 
work was co-sponsored by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST), and included 
evaluation ot only of the T IPSTER contractors, but 
also of many information retrieval groups outside of 
the T IPSTER project. The conferences were run as 
workshops that provided a forum for participating 
groups to discuss their system results on the retrieval 
tasks done using the T IPSTER/TREC collection. As 
with the first four TRECs, the goals of these work- 
shops were: 
? to encourage research in text retrieval based on 
large test collections; 
? to increase communication among industry, 
academia, and government by creating an open 
forum for the exchange of research ideas; 
? to speed the transfer of technology from research 
labs into commercial products by demonstrating 
substantial improvements in retrieval method- 
ologies on real-world problems; 
? to increase the availability of appropriate val- 
uation techniques for use by industry and 
academia, including development of new evalu- 
ation techniques more applicable to current sys- 
tems; and 
? to serve as a showcase for state-of-the-art e- 
trieval systems for DARPA and its clients. 
For each TREC, NIST provides a test set of docu- 
ments and questions. Participants run their retrieval 
systems on the data, and return to NIST a list of the 
retrieved top-ranked ocuments. NIST pools the in- 
dividual results, judges the retrieved ocuments for 
correctness, and evaluates the results. The TREC 
cycle ends with a workshop that is a forum for par- 
ticipants to share their experiences. The most recent 
workshop in the series, TREC-7, was held at NIST 
in November 1998. 
The number of participating systems has grown 
from 25 in TREC-1 to 38 in TREC-5 (Table 1), 51 
in TREC-6 (Table 1), and 56 in TREC-7 (Table 1). 
The groups include representatives from 16 different 
countries and 32 companies. 
TREC provides a common test set to focus research 
on a particular etrieval task, yet actively encourages 
participants to do their own experiments within the 
umbrella task. The individual experiments broaden 
the scope of the research that is done within TREC 
and make TREC more attractive to individual par- 
ticipants. This marshaling of research efforts has suc- 
ceeded in improving the state of the art in retrieval 
technology, both in the level of basic performance (see 
Figure 1) and in the ability of these systems to func- 
tion well in diverse environments, uch as retrieval 
in a filtering operation or retrieval against multiple 
languages. 
Each of the TREC conferences has centered around 
two main tasks: the routing task (not run in TREC- 
7) and the ad hoc task (these tasks are described in 
more detail in Section 2.3). In addition, starting in 
TREC-4 a set of "tracks" or tasks that focus on par- 
ticular subproblems of text retrieval was introduced. 
These tracks include tasks that concentrate on a spe- 
cific part of the retrieval process (such as the inter- 
active track which focuses on user-related issues), or 
tasks that tackle research in related areas, such as the 
retrieval of spoken "documents" from news broad- 
casts. 
The  graph in Figure i shows that retrieval effective- 
ness has approximately doubled since the beginning 
of TREC.  This means,  for example,  that retrieval en- 
gines that could retrieve three good  documents  within 
the top ten documents  retrieved in 1992 are now likely 
to retrieve six good  documents  in the top ten docu- 
ments  retrieved for the same search. The  figure plots 
retrieval effectiveness for one wel l -known retrieval en- 
gine, the SMART system of Cornell University. The  
SMART system has consistently been one of the more  
effective systems in TREC,  but other systems are

comparable with it, so the graph is representative of 
the increase in effectiveness for the field as a whole. 
Researchers at Cornell ran the version of SMART 
used in each of the seven TREC conferences against 
each of the seven ad hoc test sets (Buckley, Mitra, 
Walz, & Cardie, 1999). Each line in the graph con- 
nects the mean average precision scores produced by 
each version of the system for a single test. For each 
test, the TREC-7 system has a markedly higher mean 
average precision than the TREC-1 system. The re- 
cent decline in the absolute scores reflects the evolu- 
tion towards more realistic, and difficult, test ques- 
tions, and also possibly a dilution of effort because of 
the many tracks being run in TRECs 5, 6, and 7. 
The seven TREC conferences represent hun- 
dreds of retrieval experiments. The Proceedings 
of each conference captures the details of the in- 
dividual experiments, and the Overview paper in 
each Proceedings ummarizes the main findings of 
each conference. A special issue on TREC-6 will 
be published in Information Processing and Man- 
agement (Voorhees, in press), which includes an 
Overview of TREC-6 (Voorhees & Harman, in press) 
as well as an analysis of the TREC effort by Sparck 
Jones (in press). 
2 THE TASKS 
Each of the TREC conferences has centered around 
two main tasks, the routing task and the ad hoc task. 
In addition, starting in TREC-4 a set of "tracks," 
tasks that focus on particular subproblems of text 
retrieval, was introduced. This section describes the 
goals of the two main tasks. Details regarding the 
tracks are given in Section 6. 
2.1 The  Rout ing  Task  
The routing task in the TREC workshops investigates 
the performance ofsystems that use standing queries 
to search new streams of documents. These searches 
are similar to those required by news clipping ser- 
vices and library profiling systems. A true routing

environment is simulated in TREC by using ques- 
tions (called topics in TREC) for which the right set 
of documents to be retrieved is known for one docu- 
ment set, and then testing the systems' performance 
with those questions on a completely new document 
set. 
The training for the routing task is shown in the 
left-hand column of Figure 2. Participants are given a 
set of topics and a document set that includes known 
relevant documents for those topics. The topics con- 
sist of natural anguage text describing a user's infor- 
mation need (see sec. 3.2 for details). The topics are 
used to create a set of queries (the actual input to 
the retrieval system) that are then used against he 
training documents. This is represented by Q1 in the 
diagram. Many Q1 query sets might be built to help 
adjust the retrieval system to the task, to create bet- 
ter weighting algorithms, and to otherwise prepare 
the system for testing. The result of the training is 
query set Q2, routing queries derived from the rout- 
ing topics and run against he test documents. 
The testing phase of the routing task is shown in 
the middle column of Figure 2. The output of run- 
ning Q2 against he test documents i the official test 
result for the routing task. 
2.2 The  Ad  Hoc  Task  
The ad hoc task investigates the performance of sys- 
tems that search a static set of documents using new 
topics. This task is similar to how a researcher might 
use a library--the collection is known but the ques- 
tions likely to be asked are not known. The right- 
hand column of Figure 2 depicts how the ad hoc task 
is accomplished in TREC. Participants are given a 
document collection consisting of approximately 2 gi- 
gabytes of text and 50 new topics. The set of relevant 
documents for these topics in the document set is not 
known at the time the participants receive the top- 
ics. Participants produce a new query set, Q3, from 
the ad hoc topics and run those queries against he 
ad hoc documents. The output from this run is the 
official test result for the ad hoc task. 
2.3 Task  Gu ide l ines  
In addition to the task definitions, TREC partici- 
pants are given a set of guidelines outlining accept- 
able methods of indexing, knowledge base construc- 
tion, and generating queries from the supplied top- 
ics. In general, the guidelines are constructed to re- 
flect an actual operational environment and to allow 
fair comparisons among the diverse query construc- 
tion approaches. The allowable query construction 
methods in TRECs 5, 6, and 7 were divided into au-

tomatic methods, in which queries are derived com- 
pletely automatically from the topic statements, and 
manual methods, which includes queries generated by 
all other methods. This definition of manual query 
construction methods permitted users to look at indi- 
vidual documents retrieved by the ad hoc queries and 
then reformulate the queries based on the documents 
retrieved. 
3 THE TEST  COLLECT IONS 
Like most traditional retrieval test collections, there 
are three distinct parts to the collections used in 
TREC: the documents, the questions or topics, and 
the relevance judgments or "right answers." This sec- 
tion describes each of these pieces for the collections 
used in the main tasks in TRECs 5, 6, and 7. Many 
of the tracks have used the same data or used data 
constructed in a similar method but in a different 
environment, such as in multiple languages or using 
different guidelines (such as high precision searching). 
3 .1 Documents  
TREC documents are distributed on CD-ROM's with 
approximately 1 GB of text on each, compressed to 
fit. Table 3.1 shows the statistics for all the English 
document collections used in TREC. TREC-5 used 
disks 2 and 4 for the ad hoc testing, while TRECs 
6 and 7 used disks 4 and 5 for ad hoc testing. The 
FBIS on disk 5 (FBIS-1) was used for testing in the 
TREC-5 routing task and for training in the TREC-6 
routing task, with new FBIS (FBIS-2) being used for 
testing in TREC-6. There was no routing task in 
TREC-7. 
Documents are tagged using SGML to allow easy 
parsing (see Fig. 3). The documents in the different 
datasets have been tagged with identical major struc- 
tures, but they have different minor structures. The 
philosophy in the formatting at NIST is to leave the 
data as close to the original as possible. No attempt 
is made to correct spelling errors, sentence fragments, 
strange formatting around tables, or similar faults. 
3 .2  Top ics  
In designing the TREC task, there was a conscious 
decision made to provide "user need" statements 
rather than more traditional queries. Two major is- 
sues were involved in this decision. First, there was 
a desire to allow a wide range of query construction 
methods by keeping the topic (the need statement) 
distinct from the query (the actual text submitted 
to the system). The second issue was the ability to 
increase the amount of information available about 
each topic, in particular to include with each topic 
a clear statement of what criteria make a document 
relevant. 
The topics used in TREC-1 and TREC-2 (topics 
1-150) were very detailed, containing multiple fields 
and lists of concepts related to the subject of the 
topics. The ad hoc topics used in TREC-3 (151-200)

alphanumeric characters. No stop words were 
were much shorter and did not contain the complex 
structure of the earlier topics. Nonetheless, partici- 
pants in TREC-3 felt that the topics were still too 
long compared with what users normally submit to 
operational retrieval systems. Therefore the TREC-4 
topics (201-250) were made even shorter: a single 
field consisting of a one sentence description of the 
information eed. Figure 4 gives a sample topic from 
each of these sets. 
One of the conclusions reached in TREC-4 was 
that the much shorter topics caused both manual and 
automatic systems trouble, and that there were is- 
sues associated with using short topics in TREC that 
needed further investigation (Harman, 1996). Ac- 
cordingly, the TREC-5 ad hoc topics re-introduced 
the title and narrative fields, making the topics sim- 
ilar in format to the TREC-3 topics. TREC-6 and 
TREC-7 topics used this same format, as shown 
in Figure 5. While having the same format as 
the TREC-3 topics, on average the later topics are 
shorter (contain fewer words) than the TREC-3 top- 
ics. Table 3.2 shows the lengths of the various sec- 
tions in the TREC topics as they have evolved over 
the 7 TRECs. 
Since TREC-3, the ad hoc topics have been created 
by the same person (or assessor) who performed the 
relevance assessments for that topic. Each assessor 
comes to NIST with ideas for topics based on his or 
her own interests, and searches the ad hoc collection 
(looking at approximately 100 documents per topic) 
to estimate the likely number of relevant documents 
per candidate topic. NIST personnel select the fi- 
nal 50 topics from among these candidates, based on 
having both a reasonable range of estimated number 
of relevant documents across topics and on balancing 
the load across assessors. 
3.3 Re levance  Assessments  
Relevance judgments are of critical importance to a 
test collection. For each topic it is necessary to com- 
pile a list of relevant documents--as comprehensive

a list as possible. All TRECs have used the pooling 
method (Sparck Jones ~ van Rijsbergen, 1975) to 
assemble the relevance assessments. In this method 
a pool of possible relevant documents i created by 
taking a sample of documents selected by the various 
participating systems. This pool is then shown to the 
human assessors. The particular sampling method 
used in TREC is to take the top 100 documents re- 
trieved in each submitted run for a given topic and 
merge them into the pool for assessment. This is 
a valid sampling technique since all the systems used 
ranked retrieval methods, with those documents most 
likely to be relevant returned first. On average, an 
assessor judges approximately 1500 documents per 
topic. 
Given the vital role relevance judgments play in 
a test collection, it is important o assess the qual- 
ity of the judgments created in TREC. In particular, 
both the completeness and the consistency of the rel- 
evance judgments are of interest. Completeness mea- 
sures the degree to which all the relevant documents 
for a topic have been found; consistency measures 
the degree to which the assessor has marked all the 
"truly" relevant documents relevant and the "truly" 
irrelevant documents irrelevant. 
The completeness of the TREC relevance judg- 
ments has been investigated both at NIST (Harman, 
1996) and independently at the Royal Melbourne In- 
stitute of Technology (RMIT) (Zobel, 1998). Both 
studies found that the completeness for most top- 
ics is adequate, though topics with many relevant 
documents are likely to have yet more relevant doc- 
uments that have not been found through pooling. 
For this reason, NIST has deliberately chosen more 
tightly focused topics in recent TRECs. Both studies 
also found that any lack of completeness did not bias 
the results of particular systems. Indeed, the RMIT 
study showed that systems that did not contribute 
documents to the pool can still be evaluated fairly 
with the resulting judgments. 
The consistency of the TREC judgments was inves- 
tigated at NIST by obtaining multiple independent 
assessments for a set of topics and evaluating systems 
using each of the different judgment sets (Voorhees, 
1998). The study confirmed that the comparative r - 
sults for different runs remains table despite changes 
in the underlying judgments. Taken together, these 
studies validate the use of the TREC collections for 
retrieval research.

age, called trec_eval,  is used to evaluate ach of 
the submitted runs. trec_eval was developed by 
Chris Buckley at Cornell University and is available 
by anonymous ftp from f tp .  cs. corne l l ,  edu in the 
pub/smart directory. TREC reports a variety of 
recall- and precision-based valuation measures for 
each run to give a broad picture of the run. 
Since TREC-3 there has been a histogram for each 
system showing performance on each topic. In gen- 
eral, more emphasis has been placed in later TRECs 
on a "per topic analysis" in an effort o get beyond the 
problems of averaging across topics. Work has been 
done, however, to find statistical differences among 
the systems (see paper "A Statistical Analysis of the 
TREC-3 Data" by Jean Tague-Sutcliffe and James 
Blustein in the TREC-3 proceedings.) Additionally 
charts have been published in the proceedings that 
consolidate information provided by the systems de- 
scribing features and system timing, allowing some 
primitive comparison of the amount of effort needed 
to produce the results. 
Figure 4 shows two typical recall/precision curves. 
The x axis plots a fixed set of recall levels where

Recall = 
total number o/ relevant items in the collection" 
The y axis plots precision values at the given recall 
level, where precision is calculated by 
number o/ relevant items retrieved 
Precision -- 
total number o\] items retrieved 
These curves represent averages over the 50 top- 
ics. The averaging method was developed many years 
ago (Salton & McGill, 1983) and is well accepted 
by the information retrieval community. The curves

show system performance across the full range of re- 
trieval, i.e., at the early stage of retrieval where the 
highly-ranked documents give high accuracy or preci- 
sion, and at the final stage of retrieval where there is 
usually a low accuracy, but more complete retrieval. 
The use of these curves assumes a ranked output from 
a system. Systems that provide an unranked set of 
documents are known to be less effective and there- 
fore were not tested in the TREC program. 
The curves in Figure 4 show that system A has 
a much higher precision at the low recall end of the 
graph and therefore is more accurate. System B how- 
ever has higher precision at the high recall end of the 
curve and therefore will give a more complete set of 
relevant documents, assuming that the user is willing 
to look further in the ranked list. 
The single-valued evaluation measure most fre- 
quently used in TREC is the mean (non-interpolated) 
average precision. The average precision for a single 
topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each 
relevant document is retrieved (using zero as the pre- 
cision for relevant documents that are not retrieved). 
The mean average precision for a run consisting of 
multiple topics is the mean of the average precision 
scores of each of the individual topics in the run. The 
average precision measure has a recall component in 
that it reflects the performance of a retrieval run 
across all relevant documents, and a precision com- 
ponent in that it weights documents retrieved earlier 
more heavily than documents retrieved later. Geo- 
metrically, mean average precision is the area under- 
neath a non-interpolated recall-precision curve. 
5 RETRIEVAL  RESULTS 
One of the important goals of the TREC conferences 
is that the participating roups freely devise their 
own experiments within the TREC task(s). For some 
groups, particularly the groups new to TREC, this 
means doing the ad hoc and/or routing task with the 
goal of achieving high retrieval effectiveness perfor- 
mance. Other groups use TREC as an opportunity 
to run experiments especially tuned to their own en- 
vironment, either taking part in the organized tracks 
or performing associated tasks that can be evaluated 
easily within the TREC framework. The experimen- 
tal work performed for TRECs 5, 6, and 7 is therefore 
both too broad and too extensive to be summarized 
within this paper. What is presented is some analy- 
sis of the trends within the ad hoc and routing tasks, 
plus a summary of the various tracks that have been 
run in these three TRECs. In all cases, readers are 
referred to the full TREC proceedings for papers from 
the various groups that give more details of their ex- 
periments. 
5 .1 The  Ad  Hoc  Resu l ts  
The basic TREC ad hoc paradigm has presented 
three major challenges to search engine technology 
from the beginning. The first is the vast scale-up in 
terms of number of documents to be searched, from 
several megabytes ofdocuments to 2 gigabytes of doc- 
uments. This system engineering problem occupied 
most systems in TREC-1, and has continued to be 
the initial work for most new groups entering TREC. 
The second challenge is that these documents are 
mostly full-text and therefore much longer than most 
algorithms in TREC-1 were designed to handle. The 
document length issue has resulted in major changes 
to the basic term weighting algorithms, starting in 
TREC-2. The third challenge has been the idea that 
a test question or topic contains multiple fields, each 
representing either facets of a user's question or the 
various lengths of text that question could be repre- 
sented in. The particular fields, and the lengths of 
these fields, have changed across the various TRECs, 
resulting in different research issues as the basic en- 
vironment has changed. 
Because TREC-1 required significant system re- 
building by most participating roups due to the huge 
increase in the size of the document collection, the 
250 
TREC-1 results should be viewed as only very pre- 
liminary due to severe time constraints. TREC-2 oc- 
curred in August of 1993, less than 10 months after 
the first conference, and the TREC-2 results can be 
seen as both a validation of the earlier experiments on 
the smaller test collections and as an excellent base- 
line for the more complex experimentation that has 
taken part in later TRECs. 
Table 5.1 summarizes the ad hoc task across the 
6 TRECs that have occurred since 1992. It illus- 
trates some of the common issues that have affected 
all groups, and also shows the initial use and subse- 
quent spread of some of the now-standard techniques 
that have emerged from TREC. 
Five different research areas are shown in the ta- 
ble, with research in many of these areas triggered by 
changes in the TREC evaluation environment. For 
example, the use of subdocuments or passages was 
caused by the initial difficulties in handling full text 
documents, particularly excessively ong ones. The 
use of better term weighting, including correct length 
normalization procedures, made this technique less 
used in TREC's 4 and 5, but it resurfaced in TREC-6 
to facilitate better input to relevance feedback. 
The first research area shown in the table is that 
of term weighting. Most of the initial participants in
TREC used term weighting that had been developed 
and tested on very small test collections with short 
documents (abstracts). Many of these algorithms 
were modified to handle longer documents in simple 
ways, however some algorithms were not amenable 
to this approach, resulting in some new fundamental 
research. The group from the Okapi system, City 
University, London (Robertson, Walker, Hancock- 
Beaulieu, & Gatford, 1994) decided to experiment 
with a completely new term weighting algorithm that 
was both theoretically and practically based on term 
distribution within longer documents. By TREC-3 
this algorithm had been "perfected" into the BM25 
algorithm now in use by many of the systems in 
TRECs 5, 6 and 7. Continuing along this same row 
in table 5.1, three other systems (the SMART sys- 
tem from Cornell (Singhal, Buckley, & Mitra, 1996), 
the PIRCS system from CUNY (Kwok, 1996) and 
the INQUERY system from the University of Mas- 
sachusetts (Allan, Ballesteros, Callan, Croft, & Lu, 
1996) changed their weighting algorithms in TREC-4 
based on analysis comparing their old algorithms to 
the new BM25 algorithm. By TREC-5 many of the 
groups had adopted these new weighting algorithms, 
with the early adopters being those systems with sim- 
ilar structural models. 
TREC-6 saw even further expansion of the use of 
these new weighting algorithms (alternatively called 
the Okapi/SMART algorithm, or the Cornell imple- 
mentation of the Okapi algorithm). In particular, 
many groups adapted these algorithms to new mod- 
els, often involving considerable experimentation to 
find the correct fit. For example IRIT (Boughanem 
& Soul6-Dupuy, 1998) modified the Okapi algorithm 
to fit a spreading activation model, IBM (Brown 
& Chong, 1998) modified it to deal with unigrams 
and trigrams, and the Australian National Uni- 
versity (Hawking, Thistlewaite, & Craswell, 1998) 
and the University of Waterloo (Cormack, Clarke, 
Palmer, & To, 1998) used it in conjunction with var- 
ious types of proximity measures. Of major note 
is the fact that City University also ran major ex- 
periments (Walker, Robertson, Boughanem, Jones, 
& Sparck Jones, 1998) with the BM25 weighting al- 
gorithm in TREC-6, including extensive xploration 
of the various existing parameters, and addition of 
some new ones involving the use of non-relevant doc- 
uments! 
It could be expected that 6 years of term weight- 
ing experiments would lead to a convergence of the 
algorithms. However, a snapshot of the top 8 sys- 
tems in TREC-7 (see Table 5.1) shows that these 
systems are derived from many models and use dif- 
ferent erm weighting algorithms and similarity mea- 
sures. Of particular note here is that new models and 
term weighting algorithms are still being developed, 
and that these are competitive with the more estab- 
lished methods. This applies both to new variations 
on old weighting algorithms, uch as the double log tf 
weighting from AT&T (Singhal, Choi, Hindle, Lewis, 
& Pereira, 1999) and to more major variations such as 
the new weighting algorithm from TNO (Hiemstra & 
Kraaij, 1999), and the completely new retrieval model 
from BBN (Miller, Leek, & Schwartz, 1999). 
The second new technique started back in TREC-2 
(the second line of table 5.1) was the use of smaller 
sections of documents, called subdocuments, by the 
PIRCS system at City University of New York (Kwok 
& Grunfeld, 1994). Again this issue was forced by 
the difficulty of using the PIRCS spreading activation 
model for documents having a wide variety of lengths. 
By TREC-3 many of the groups were also using sub- 
documents, or passages, to help with retrieval. But, 
as mentioned before, TREC's 4 and 5 saw far less use 
of this technique as many groups dropped the use of 
passages due to minimal added improvements in per- 
formance. 
TREC-6 saw a revival in the use of passages, 
but generally only for specific uses. Whereas the 
PIRCS system continued to use 550-word subdocu-

ments for all its processing, most systems used pas- 
sages only in the topic expansion phase. The Aus- 
tralian National University (Hawking et al, 1998) 
worked with "hot spots" of 500 characters surround- 
ing the original topic terms to locate new expansion 
terms. AT&T (Singhal, 1998) used overlapping win- 
dows of 50 words to help rerank the top 50 documents 
before selecting the final documents for use in expan- 
sion. The University of Waterloo (Cormack et al, 
1998) used passages of maximum length 64 words to 
select expansion terms, whereas Verity (Pedersen, Sil- 
verstein, & Vogt, 1998) used their automatic summa- 
rizer for this purpose. Two groups ( Lexis-Nexis (Lu, 
Meier, Rao, Miller, & Pliske, 1998) and MDS (Fuller 
et al, 1998)) performed major experiments in the 
use of passages, particularly when employed in con- 
junction with other methods as input to data fusion. 
This diverse use of passages continued in TREC-7, 
with passages clearly becoming one of the standard 
tools for experimentation. 
The query expansion/modification techniques 
shown in the third and fourth lines of the table 5.1 
were started when the topics were substantially short- 
ened in TREC-3. As described in section 3.2, the for- 
mat of the topics was modified to remove a valuable 
source of keywords: the concept section. In the search 
for some technique that would automatically expand 
the topic, several groups revived an old technique of 
assuming that the top retrieved ocuments are rel- 
evant, and then using them in relevance feedback. 
This technique, which had not worked on smaller col- 
lections, turned out to work very well in the TREC 
environment. 
By TREC-6 almost all groups were using variations 
on expanding queries using information from the top 
retrieved documents (often called pseudo-relevance 
feedback). There are many parameters needed for 
success here, such as how many top documents to 
use for mining terms, how many terms to select, and 
how to weight those terms. There has been gen- 
eral convergence on some of these parameters. Ta- 
ble 5.1 shows the characteristics of the expansion 
tools used in the top 8 systems in TREC-7. The 
second column gives the basic expansion model, with 
the vector-based systems using the Rocchio expan- 
sion and other systems using expansion models more 
suitable to their retrieval model. For example, the 
Local Context Analysis (LCA) method eveloped by 
the INQUERY group (Xu & Croft, 1996) has been 
successfully used by other groups. The third column 
shows the number of top-ranked documents (P if pas- 
sages were used), and the number of terms added 
from these documents. It should be noted that these 
numbers are more similar than in earlier TRECs, al- 
though they are still being investigated by new sys- 
tems adopting these techniques as there can be subtle 
differences between systems that strongly influence 
parameter selection. The fourth column shows the 
source of the documents being mined for terms, which 
has generally moved to the use of as much informa- 
tion as possible, i.e. all the TREC disks as opposed 
to only those being used for testing purposes. 
TRECs 5, 6, and 7 saw many additional exper- 
iments in the query expansion area. The Open 
Text Corporation (Fitzpatrick & Dent, 1997) gath- 
ered terms for expansion by looking at relevant doc- 
uments from past topics that were loosely similar to 
the TREC-5 topics. Several groups ( (Lu, Ayoub, & 
Dong, 1997; Namba, Igata, Horai, Nitta, & Matsui, 
1999)) have tried clustering the top retrieved ocu- 
ments in order to more accurately select expansion 
terms, and in TREC-6 three groups (City University, 
AT&T, and IRIT) successfully got information from 
negative feedback, i.e. using non-relevant documents 
to modify the expansion process. 
TREC-7 contained even more experiments in au- 
tomatic query expansion, such as the group (Man- 
dala, Tokunaga, Tanaka, Okumura ,  ~ Satoh, 1999) 
that compared the use of three different thesauri 
for expansion (WordNet, a simple co-occurrance the-

saurus and an automatically built thesaurus using 
predicate-argument structures). Of particular note 
is the AT&T (Singhal et al, 1999) investigation 
into "conservative enrichment" to avoid the addi- 
tional noise caused by using larger corpora (all five 
disks) for query expansion. 
Groups that build their queries manually also 
looked into better query expansion techniques start- 
ing in TREC-3 (see fourth line of table 5.1). At first 
these xpansions involved using other sources to man- 
ually expand the initial query. However the rules gov- 
erning manual query building changed in TREC-5 
to allow unrestricted interactions with the systems. 
This change caused a major evolution in the manual ? 
query expansion, with most systems not only manu- 
ally expanding the initial queries, but then looking at 
retrieved ocuments in order to further expand the 
queries, much in the manner that users of these sys- 
tems could operate. Two types of experiments were 
notable in TREC-5: those that could be labelled as 
"manual exploration" runs and those that involved 
a more complex type of human-machine interaction. 
The first type is exemplified by the GE group (Strza- 
lkowski et al, 1997), where the task was to ask users 
to pick out phrases and sentences from the retrieved ? 
documents oadd to the query, in hopes that this pro- 
cess could be imitated by automatic methods. The 
CLARITECH group (Milic-Frayling, Evans, Tong, & 
Zhai, 1997) is a good example of the second type of ? 
manual TREC-5 runs. They examined a multi-stage 
process of query construction, where the goal was to 
investigate better sets of tools that allow users to 
improve their queries, including different sources for 
suggestions ofexpansion terms and also various levels 
of user-added constraints o the expansion process. 
Many of the manual experiments seen in both 
TREC-6 andTREC-7, however, hark back to the sim- 
pler scenario f having users edit the automaticaily- 
generated query, or having users select documents 
to be used in automatic relevance feedback. Several 
of the groups had specific user strategies that they 
tested. 
GE Corporate R&D/Rutgers University (Strza- 
lkowski, Lin, & Perez-Carballo, 1998) used 
automatically-generated summaries of the top 
30 documents retrieved as sources of manually- 
selected terms and phrases. 
CLARITECH Corp. (Evans, Huettner, Tong, 
Jansen, & Bennett, 1999) performed a user 
experiment measuring the difference in per- 
formance between two presentation modes: a 
ranked list vs a clustered set of documents. 
University of Toronto (Bodner & Chignell, 1999) 
used their dynamic hypertext model to build the 
queries. 
Lexis-Nexis (Rao, Humphrey, Parhizgar, Wilson, 
& Pliske, 1999) experimented with human rele- 
254 
vance feedback as opposed to automatic feedback 
from the top 20 documents. 
The final line in table 5.1 shows some of the other 
areas that have seen concentrated research in the 
ad hoc task. Data fusion has been used in TREC 
by many groups in various ways, but has increased 
in complexity over the years. For example, a project 
involving four teams led by Tomek Strzalkowski has 
continued the investigation of merging results from 
multiple streams of input using different indexing 
methods ((Strzalkowski et al, 1997, 1998, 1999). 
In TREC-6, several groups such as Lexis-Nexis (Lu 
et al, 1998) and MDS (Fuller et al, 1998) used mul- 
tiple stages of data fusion, including merging results 
from different erm weighting schemes, various mix- 
tures of documents and passages, and different query 
expansion schemes. 
The INQUERY system from the University of Mas- 
sachusetts has worked in all TREC's to automati- 
cally build more structure into their queries, based 
on information they have "mined" from the top- 
ics (Brown, 1995). Starting in TREC-5, there have 
been experiments by other groups to use more in- 
formation from the initial topic. Lexis-Nexis (Lu 
et al, 1997) used the inter-term distance between 
nouns in the topic. Several other groups have made 
use of term proximity features (Australian National 
University (Hawking, Thistlewaite, & Bailey, 1997), 
University of Waterloo (Clarke & Cormack, 1997) , 
and IBM) to improve retrieval scores, while others 
(CUNY (Kwok & Grunfeld, 1997), AT&T (Singhal, 
1998), and INQUERY (Allan, Callan, Sanderson, Xu, 
& Wegmann, 1999)) have used the initial topic to 
look for clues that would suggest a need for more 
emphasis on certain topic terms. TREC-7 had two 
additional groups working with the use of term co- 
occurrance and proximity as alternative methods for 
ranking (see (Braschler, Wechsler, Mateev, Mitten- 
dorf, & Sch~iuble, 1999) and (Nakajima, Takaki, Hi- 
rao, & Kitauchi, 1999)). 
A final theme that has continued throughout all 
the TREC conferences has been the investigation of 
the use of phrases in addition to single terms. This 
has long been a topic for research in the informa- 
tion retrieval community, with generally unsuccess- 
ful results. However there was initially hope that 
use of phrases in these much larger collections would 
become critical and almost all groups have experi- 
mented with phrases. In general these experiments 
have been equally unsuccessful. 
The fourth column of table 5.1 shows the 
widespread use of phrases in addition to single terms 
in TREC-7, but the minimal improvement from their 
use. The biggest improvement reported in the papers 
was 3.6% from the INQUERY group at the Univer- 
sity of Massachusetts (Allan et al, 1999). Whereas 
most of the other groups are also using phrases, many 
did not bother to test for differences due to minimal 
results in earlier years. Cornell/SabIR reported 7.7% 
improvement in TREC-6, but this is the improve- 
ment on top of the initial baseline, not the improve- 
ment after expansion. Private conversations with sev- 
eral of these groups indicate that these improvements 
are likely to be much less if measured after expan- 
sion. As is often the case, these minimal changes 
in the averages cover a wide variation in phrase per- 
formance across topics. A special run by the Okapi 
group (many thanks) showed less than a 1% average 
difference in performance, but 19 topics helped by 
phrases, 14 hurt, and the rest unchanged. Whereas 
the benefit of phrases is not proven, they are likely to 
remain a permanent tool in the retrieval systems in a 
manner similar to the earlier adoption of stemming. 
It is interesting to note that many of these groups 
are using different phrase "gathering" techniques. 
The Okapi group has a manually-built phrase list 
with synonym classes that has slowly grown over 
the years based on mostly past TREC topics. The 
automatically-produced INQUERY phrase list was 
new for TREC-6 (Allan et al, 1998), the Cornell list 
was basically unchanged from early TRECs, and the 
BBN list was based on a new bigram model. 
The creation of two formal topic lengths in TREC-5 
has inspired many experiments comparing results us- 
ing those different opic lengths, and the addition of 
a formal "title" in TREC-6 increased these investiga- 
tions. Table 5.1 shows the results (official and unof- 
ficial as reported in the papers) of the top 8 TREC-7 
groups howing their use of different topic parts. The 
second column gives the various topic parts used by 
each group (T = title, D = description, N = narra- 
tive). The third column gives the average precision 
using only the description and title. The fourth and 
fifth columns give the corresponding performance of
the systems using either only the title or using the 
full topic (all topic parts). 
Note that most of the best runs use the full topic. 
However there is now a smaller performance differ- 
ence between runs that use the full topic and runs 
that use only the title and description sections than 
was seen in earlier TRECs. This is most likely due 
to improved query expansion methods, but could be 
due to variations across topic sets. It should be noted 
that the improvement going to the full topic is only 
1% for several groups. The decrease in performance 
using only the title is more marked, ranging from 4%

to 22%. The TREC-7 title results should be a truer 
measure of the effects of using the title only than 
TREC-6, where the descriptions were often missing 
key terms. However, it is not clear how representative 
these titles are with respect o very short user inputs 
and therefore title results should best be viewed as 
how well these systems could perform on very short, 
but very good user input. 
Looking at individual topic results hows a less con- 
sistent picture. Table 5.1 shows the number of topics 
that had the best performance from among a group's 
three runs using different input lengths. Not only 
is there a wide variation across topics, there is also 
a wide variation across systems in that topics that 
work best at a particular length for one group did 
not necessarily work best at that length for the other 
groups. 
5 .2  The  Rout ing  Resu l ts  
The routing evaluation used a specifically selected 
subset of the training topics against a new set of test 
documents, but there have always been difficulties in 
locating appropriate t sting data for the routing task. 
TREC-3 was forced to re-use some of the training 
data, and TREC-4 performed routing tests using the 
Federal Register (with new data) for 25 of the topics, 
and using training data and "net trash" for testing 
the other 25 topics. This situation was clearly not 
ideal and for TREC-5 NIST held back decisions on 
the routing topics until a new data source could be 
found. 
When the FBIS data became available, it was de- 
cided to pick topics that had many relevant docu- 
ments in the Associated Press data, on the assump- 
tion that the FBIS data would be similar to AP. Be- 
cause of delays in getting and processing the data, 
this assumption could not be checked out, and prob- 
lems arose that will be discussed later. 
It should be noted that the routing task in TREC 
has always served two purposes. The first is its in- 
tended purpose: to test systems in their abilities to 
use training data to build effective filters or profiles. 
The second purpose, which has become equally im- 
portant in the more recent TRECs, is to serve as a 
learning environment for more effective retrieval tech- 
niques in general. Groups use the relevance judg- 
ments to explore the characteristics of relevant doc- 
uments, such as which features are most effective to 
use for retrieval or how to best merge results from 
multiple queries. This is more profitable than simply 
using the previous TREC results in a retrospective 
manner because of the use of completely new testing 
data for evaluation. 
A focus on using the training data as a learning 
environment was particularly prevalent in TREC-5. 
Cornell (Buckley, Singhal, & Mitra, 1997) used the 
relevant and non-relevant documents for investiga- 
tions of Rocchio feedback algorithms, including more 
complex processes of expansion and weighting. The 
University of Waterloo (Clarke & Cormack, 1997) in- 
teractively searched the training data for co-occurring 
substrings and GE (Strzalkowski et al, 1997) ran 
major experiments in data fusion to test their new 
stream-based architecture. In each of these cases the 
experiments are assumed to lead to better ways of 
doing the routing task, and also to new approaches 
for the ad hoc task. 
Three experimental themes dominate most routing 
experiments in TREC-5. The first is the discovery of 
optimal features (usually single terms) for use in the 
query or filter. The Okapi System from City Univer- 
sity, London (Beaulieu et al, 1997) continued its ex- 
periments in repeatedly trying various combinations 
of terms to discover the optimal set, but for TREC-5 
used subsets of the training data. The University of 
California at Berkeley (Gey, Chen, He, Xu, & Meggs, 
1997) concentrated on further investigations of the 
use of the chi-square discrimination measure to lo- 
cate large numbers of good terms, and the Swiss Fed- 
eral Institute of Techology (ETH) (Ballerini et al, 
1997) tried three different feature selection methods, 
including the chi-square method, the RSV (OKAPI) 
method, and a new method, the U measure. Xe- 
rox (Hull et al, 1997) also investigated a new feature 
selection method, the binomial ikelihood ratio test. 
The second theme was the use of co-occurring term 
pairs in the training data to "expand" the query. 
Four groups experimented with locating and incorpo- 
rating co-occurring pairs of terms, including the IN- 
QUERY group from the University of Massachusetts 
in both TREC-4 and TREC-5 (Allan et al, 1996, 
1997), and Cornell University in TREC-5 (Buckley 
et ai., 1997). As mentioned before, Waterloo interac- 
tively looked for word-pairs or co-occurring strings to 
manually add to their query. ETH used the OKAPI 
RSV values to formally motivate a series of experi-

meats using co-occurring terms within different por- 
tions of the document (within sentence, within para- 
graph, etc.) as different methods of constructing 
queries. These multiple representations of the query 
were then linearly combined, with the parameters for 
that combination discovered using logistic regression 
on the training data. 
The  third theme in the routing experiments was 
the continuing effort to use only subsets of the train- 
ing data. The  number  of judged documents  per topic 
is on the order of 2000 or more, and this can be eom- 
putationally difficult for complex  techniques. Effi- 
ciency has motivated CUNY experiments (the P IRCS 
system) since TREC-3  where they tried using only 
the "short" documents  for training. In TREC-5  this 
group (Kwok  & Grunfeld, 1997) used genetic algo- 
rithms to select the optimal set of training docu- 
ments. Cornell (in TREC-5)  used a new "query zone" 
technique to subset the training documents  so that 
not all non-relevant documents  were used for train- 
ing. The  goal was not just improved efficiency, but 
also improved effectiveness in that training was more  
concentrated on documents  that the Cornell system 
was likely to retrieve. 
There is another issue that suggests the use of sub- 
sets: the prob lem of overfitting the queries/methods 
to the training data. This was specifically emphasized 
in the City system, where  they used different subsets 
of the training data for locating features, and used 
combinations of runs for their final results. Xerox  
used subsets to reduce overfitting, with their subsets 
based on finding documents  within a "local zone" to 
the query (a predecessor to the query zoning tech- 
nique used by Cornell). The  Xerox  paper provides 
more  discussion of the overfitting prob lem and sug- 
gests some additional techniques to avoid it. 
As  in the ad hoc task, there is a heavy adoption 
rate across groups for successful techniques. For the 
ad hoc task these techniques revolve around better 
ways of handling the initial topic, or use of the top X 
documents for relevance f edback. Because of the ex- 
istence of training data in routing, the routing experi- 
ments have generally not used the topic itself heavily, 
but constructed queries mainly based on the train- 
ing data. The success of these techniques therefore 
revolves around how well the test data matches the 
training data, and also on how tuned the techniques 
are to the particular training data. 
TREC-5 used AP documents as training data, with 
FBIS material for test data. Whereas the types of 
documents are similar, the domains of the documents 
did not always match. For some topics there was a 
good match of training and test data, but for others 
the match was very poor, and very few relevant doc- 
uments were found for those topics. Four topics had 
zero relevant documents in the test set, and an addi- 
tional six topics had only one or two relevant docu- 
ments. Additionally there was a serious mismatch on 
the number of relevant documents for a topic in the 
training data and in the test data. Even after drop- 
ping the four topics with no relevant documents from 
the evaluation, the results are still heavily affected by 
the mismatch. The overall results for TREC-5 were 
not better than for TREC-4 (or TREC-3. 
In TREC-6 an attempt was made to have a close 
match between the training and test data. Since 
the TREC-5 routing task had used a document 
stream from the Foreign Broadcast Information Ser- 
vice (FBIS) as its test set, a new stream of FBIS 
documents was selected as the TREC-6 test set. The 
TREC-6 routing topics consisted of 38 topics used in 
TREC-5 that had at least 5 relevant documents in the 
original FBIS stream, plus nine new topics (that had 
minimal training data on the original FBIS stream). 
The histogram in Figure 7 shows that the training 
and test data do have similar numbers of relevant 
documents for most topics. 
The following gives the various experiments hat 
were run by the 8 top performing systems in the 
TREC-6 routing task.

? AT&T Labs Research (Singhal, 1998) added the 
machine learning technique of boosting to the 
query refinement phase of the Cornell TREC-5 
routing algorithm (which includes the use of 
word pairs, DFO optimization, and query zones). 
? City University, London (Walker et al, 1998) ex- 
plored iterative methods of term weighting with 
the goal of avoiding overfitting. 
? Cornell/SaBIR esearch (Buckley, Mitra, Walz, 
& Cardie, 1998) also used a variant of the basic 
Cornell TREC-5 routing approach, adding Su- 
perConcepts o the routing query. 
? Queens College, CUNY (Kwok, Grunfeld, & Xu, 
1998) combined results from five separate com- 
ponent runs; this combined result is superior to 
each of the individual components. 
? University of Waterloo (Cormack et al, 1998) 
interactively refined a set of Boolean queries into 
a single tiered Boolean query for each topic. 
? Claxitech Corporation (Milic-Frayling, Zhai, 
Tong, Jansen, & Evans, 1998) explored the ben- 
efits of using different term selection methods in 
different parts of the query refinement process. 
For this run they developed ifferent queries us- 
ing different erm selection strategies and then, 
for each topic, selected the query that performed 
the best on the training data. 
? MSI/IRIT/SIG/CERISS (Boughanem & Soul& 
Dupuy, 1998) continued their work with a 
spreading activation model by expanding queries 
with the top 30 terms from relevance backprop- 
agation. 
? Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) 
(Mateev, Munteanu, Sheridan, Wechsler, 
Sch~iuble, 1998) also performed a combination 
run where one component run selected query 
words and phrases based on the U-measure. 
The best mean average precision for a routing 
run in TREC-6 was .420, a 9% improvement over 
TREC-5's best of .386. However, given that the 
TREC-6 task was designed to use a homogeneous 
data set whereas the TREC-5 test data were differ- 
ent from the training data, a greater improvement 
was expected. At this point, it is unclear why the 
difference was not greater. It is possible that while 
the numbers of relevant documents in the training 
and test set are comparable, the relevant documents 
258 
in each set don't "look like" each other. However, this 
is unlikely since both sets of documents come from a 
common source. It is also possible that the mismatch 
between training and test sets is not as significant a 
factor as was thought. 
Another hypothesis uggested by (Singhal, 1998) 
is that the relevance judgments are less consistent 
for routing than they are for the ad hoc task, and 
that this inconsistency prevents the machine learning 
methods that are prevalent in the task from perform- 
ing well. Since some routing topics have been used 
many times, and therefore have relevance judgments 
spanning many years, the judgments are likely to be 
less consistent than for the ad hoc task. It may be in- 
structive to explore the stability of the routing tech- 
niques in the face of different relevance judgments, 
especially given that real user judgments are known 
to be extremely volatile (Schamber, 1994). 
Because of operational constraints on the overall 
TREC program, it was decided to pursue further in- 
vestigations in routing within the very closely related 
filtering track. For this reason there was no routing 
task in TREC-7, but there was a routing option in 
the filtering track. 
6 THE TRACKS 
One of the goals of TREC is to provide a common 
task evaluation that allows cross-system comparisons, 
and this has proven to be a key strength in TREC. 
A second major strength is the loose definition of 
the ad hoc task, which allows a wide range of ex- 
periments. The addition of secondary tasks (called 
tracks) in TREC-4 combined these strengths by cre- 
ating a common evaluation for retrieval subproblems. 
TREC participants are free to turn in results for any, 
or all, or none, of the tracks. 
The tracks have had a significant impact on TREC 
participation. Figure 8 shows the number of exper- 
iments performed in each TREC, where the set of 
runs submitted for a track by one group is counted 
as one experiment. The number of experiments in- 
creased each year through TREC-6 then decreased in
TREC-7, mostly due to the elimination of the rout- 
ing main task and the Chinese track. The number 
of participants performing the ad hoc task continues 
to grow, with 42 groups taking part in TREC-7 com- 
pared to 31 in TREC-6. The number of participants 
in each of the TREC-7 tracks and the corresponding 
TREC-6 participation is given below.

The set of tracks run in any particular year de- 
pends on the interests of the participants and spon- 
sors, as well as on the suitability of the problem to 
the TREC environment. Some initial tracks have 
been discontinued because the goals of the track were 
met. For example, the Spanish track, an ad hoc task 
in which both topics and documents are in Spanish, 
was discontinued when the results demonstrated that 
current retrieval systems can retrieve Spanish doc- 
uments as effectively as English documents. Other 
tracks, such as the interactive track, have been run 
each year, but have changed their focus in different 
years. Each track has a set of guidelines developed 
under the direction of the track coordinator. The set 
of tracks and their primary goals are listed below. 
See the track reports in the various TREC proceed- 
ings for a more complete description of each track 
and its results. 
6 .1 The  Span ish  and  Ch inese  Tracks  
Track reports- (Smeaton & Wilkinson, 1997; Wilkin- 
son, 1998) 
The first non-English track was started in TREC-3. 
Four groups worked with 25 topics in Spanish, us- 
ing a document collection consisting of about 200 
megabytes (58,000 documents) of a Mexican news- 
paper from Monterey (El Norte). Since there was no 
training data for testing (similar to the startup prob- 
lems for TREC-1), the groups used simple techniques. 
The major result from this very preliminary experi- 
ment in a second language was the ease of porting the 
retrieval techniques across languages. Cornell (Buck- 
ley, Salton, Allan, & Singhal, 1995) reported that 
only 5 to 6 hours of system changes were necessary 
(beyond creation of any stemmers or stopword lists). 
In TREC-4 10 groups took part, using the same 
document collection and 25 new topics. The final 
round of Spanish retrieval took place in TREC-5, 
again with 25 new topics and also with additional 
text (1994 newswire from Agence France Presse, in- 
cluding 308 megabytes or 173,950 documents). Seven 
groups took part in Spanish, with several of them 
building more elaborate procedures for testing, such

as Spanish POS taggers. But in the main these did 
not improve performance and the major outcome of 
the Spanish track was that most of the techniques 
used in English retrieval, including the advanced ones 
used in the ad hoc task, can be successfully applied 
to Spanish. 
The purpose of the Chinese track was to investi- 
gate retrieval performance for a language whose or- 
thographics are not word-oriented. Participants per- 
formed an ad hoc search in which both the topics and 
the documents were in Chinese. The document set 
was a collection of articles selected from the Peoples 
Daily newspaper and the Xinhua newswire, a total of 
168,811 documents in 170 megabytes. Twenty-eight 
topics were created for the track in TREC-5 and an 
additional 26 topics for TREC-6. 
Nine groups submitted Chinese runs in TREC-5, 
and since it was the first year for Chinese in TREC, 
most groups concentrated on segmentation issues. 
In TREC-6 there were 12 participating roups, and 
again the majority of the experiments compared if- 
ferent methods of segmenting the text into retrieval 
features. In general, approaches that used single 
characters or bi-grams as features were competitive 
with word-based approaches and had the advantage 
of not requiring complicated segmentation schemes. 
A confounding factor in the analysis of the retrieval 
results was that the retrieval effectiveness was quite 
high (the median mean average precision was greater 
than 0.5), and was similar across systems. It was dif- 
ficult to distinguish more effective techniques when 
all techniques appear to work equally as well. With- 
out more testing, it was not possible to determine 
whether the TREC-6 topics were simply easy, or if 
there is something inherent in Chinese that facilitates 
retrieval. Further testing was postponed until new 
Chinese data could be assembled. 
6 .2  The  Cross  Language (CL IR)  
T rack  
Track reports- (Sch~uble ~ Sheridan, 1998; 
Braschler, Krause, Peters, & Sch~uble, 1999) 
The CLIR task focuses on searching for documents 
in one language using topics in a different language. 
The first CLIR track was held in TREC-6 (Sch~uble 
& Sheridan, 1998). Three document sets were used: a 
250 MB set of French documents from the Swiss news 
agency Sehweizerisehe Depesehen Agentur (SDA); a 
330 MB set of German documents from SDA plus 
a set of articles (200 MB) from the newspaper New 
Zurich Newspaper (NZZ); and a 750 mB set of English 
documents from the AP newswire. All of the doc- 
ument sets contain news stories from approximately 
the same time period, but are not aligned or specially 
coordinated with one another. A set of 25 topics that 
260 
were translated into each of the languages was also 
provided. Participants earched for documents in one 
target language using topics written in a different lan- 
guage. In addition, participants were asked to per- 
form a monolingual run in the target language to act 
as a baseline. 
Thirteen groups participated in the TREC-6 CLIR 
track. Three major approaches to cross-language r - 
trieval were represented: machine translation, where 
either the topics or the documents were translated 
into the target language; the use of machine-readable 
bilingual dictionaries or other existing linguistic re- 
sources; and the use of corpus resources to train or 
otherwise enable the cross-language r trieval mech- 
anism. The approaches all behaved similarly in 
that some group obtained good cross-language per- 
formance for each method. In general, the best cross- 
language performance was between 50%-75% as ef- 
fective as a quality monolingual run. 
The TREC-7 task expanded on this beginning. 
The document set for the TREC-7 track consisted 
of all the documents used in the TREC-6 track plus 
the Italian version of the SDA for the same time pe- 
riod. Participants were provided with a new set of 28 
topics (with translations available in English, French, 
German, and Italian), and used one topic language 
to search the combined document set. That is, a 
single run retrieved documents written in different 
languages. To enable participation in the track by 
more groups, a second task was also defined in which 
English topics were run against he combined French 
and English document set. 
The TREC-7 track also defined an optional sub- 
task. The subtask used a different document collec- 
tion, a 31,000 document structured atabase (format- 
ted as SGML fielded text data) from the field of social 
science plus the NZZ articles, and a separate set of 
28 topics. The rational of the subtask was to study 
CLIR in a vertical domain (i.e. social science) where 
a German/English thesaurus is available. 
Nine groups participated in the TREC-7 CLIR 
track, with five groups performing the test on the 
full four-language collection, and seven groups per- 
forming the test on the English and French collec- 
tion. No runs were submitted for the optional sub- 
task; however this subtask is planned to be repeated 
in TREC-8 now that groups have more experience 
with cross language retrieval. The results of the track 
demonstrate that very different approaches to cross- 
language retrieval can lead to comparable retrieval 
effectiveness. 
The construction of the cross language test col- 
lection differs from the way the other TREC collec- 
tions have been created. The set of topics created 
for the track were developed at four different institu- 
tions: NIST (English); EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland 
(French); University Bonn, Germany (German); and 
CNR, Pisa, Italy (Italian). Each institution created 
topics that would target documents in their corre- 
sponding language. The relevance judgments for all 
topics for a particular document language were also 
made at the site responsible for that language. This is 
the first time that TREC has used multiple relevance 
assessors for a single topic. 
6 .3  The  F i l te r ing  Track  
Track reports-  (Lewis, 1997; Hull, 1998, 1999) 
As mentioned before, the routing task investigates 
the performance of systems that use standing queries 
to search new streams of documents. As the routing 
task is defined in TREC, participants use old top- 
ics with existing relevance judgments to form rout- 
ing queries. These queries are then run against a 
previously unseen document collection to produce a 
ranked document list. However, real routing appli- 
cations generally require a system to make a binary 
decision whether or not to retrieve the current docu- 
ment, not to form a ranking of a document set. The 
filtering track was started in TREC-4 to address this 
more difficult version of the routing task. 
The question of how to evaluate filtering runs has 
been a focus of the filtering track since its inception. 
Since filtering results are an unordered set of docu- 
ments, the rank-based measures used in the ad hoc 
and routing tasks are not appropriate. The  main  ap- 
proach has been to try utility functions as measures  
of the quality of the retrieved set--the quality is com-  
puted as a function of the benefit of retrieving a rele- 
vant document  and  the cost of retrieving an irrelevant 
document .  
In TREC-5 ,  a family of three functions was  tried 
in an investigation of how retrieval was  affected by 
changes in the relative worth  of retrieving a relevant 
document  versus not retrieving a nonrelevant docu- 
ment. There  were seven participating groups, but the 
major  outcome was  the awareness of the difficulty of 
defining an appropriate utility measure.  
In TREC-6  two different utility functions were 
used: 
F1 = 3R + - 2N + 
F2 = 3R +-N +-R-  
261 
where R + is the number of relevant documents that 
are retrieved, R -  is the number of relevant documents 
that are not retrieved, and N + is the number of non- 
relevant documents that are retrieved. 
A problem with utilities as measures i  that differ- 
ent topics have widely varying possible utility values, 
and these utilities cannot be normalized. Thus, util- 
ities cannot be meaningfully averaged or compared 
across topics. A second measure, average set preci- 
sion (ASP) defined as the product of recall and preci- 
sion, was therefore introduced in TREC-6. Unfortu- 
nately, ASP suffers from its own drawback. When no 
relevant documents are retrieved, ASP is 0 regardless 
of how many non-relevant documents are retrieved. 
This is a problem in filtering evaluation since know- 
ing when to NOT retrieve documents i an important 
part of the filtering task. 
The F1 utility measure defined above rewards a 
system with 3 "points" for every relevant document 
document it retrieves, and penalizes the system two 
"points" for every nonrelevant document it retrieves. 
While these benefit and cost values seem reasonable, 
they define a level of performance that is quite chal- 
lenging for current systems to meet. Ten groups par- 
ticipated in the TREC-6 filtering track and submitted 
a total of 17 runs that were optimized for the F1 mea- 
sure. The best of these runs had a positive utility for 
33 (of 47) topics, and the median of the 17 runs had 
a positive utility for just 20 topics. Since retrieving 
no documents has an F1 utility of 0, retrieving no 
documents would result in a better F1 utility than 
current systems obtain on average. 
The F2 utility measure is even more demanding 
since systems are penalized for not retrieving relevant 
documents (and thus retrieving no documents also 
results in a negative utility). Of the 17 runs optimized 
for the F2 utility, only 10 topics had a positive median 
F2 utility. 
The TREC-7 filtering track contained three tasks 
of increasing difficulty (and realism). For each task, 
topics 1-50 and the AP newswire collection on Disks 
1-3 were used (with different splits into training and 
test sets, depending on the task). The first task was 
the traditional routing task. The second task was a 
batch filtering task in which systems are given topics 
and relevance judgments as in the routing task, and 
must then decide whether or not to retrieve ach doc- 
ument in the test portion of the collection. This task 
is what previous filtering tracks in TRECs 5 and 6 
had performed. 
The third task, and the focus of the TREC-7 track, 
was an adaptive filtering task. In this task, a filtering 
system starts with just the query derived from the 
topic statement, and  processes documents  one at a 
t ime in date order. If the system decides to retrieve 
a document ,  it obtains the relevance judgment  for it, 
and  can modi fy  its query as desired. 
In TREC-7  two different utility functions were 
used: 
F1 = 3R + - 2N + 
F3 = 4R + - N + 
where R + and N + are the number of relevant and 
non-relevant documents retrieved, respectively. An 
approach to scaling and normalizing utilities was in- 
troduced in this year's track(Hull, 1999) 
Twelve groups submitted at least one TREC-7 fil- 
tering run. A total of 46 runs were submitted, con- 
sisting of 10 routing runs, 12 batch filtering runs, 
and 24 adaptive filtering runs. The track results 
demonstrated that adaptive filtering is a challeng- 
ing problem for current systems. Indeed, when using 
the F1 utility measure to evaluate performance, the 
"baseline" system which retrieves no documents was 
the most effective system overall. Comparison with 
batch filtering results show that setting an appropri- 
ate threshhold for when to retrieve a document is a 
critical, and difficult, task in adaptive filtering. 
6 .4  The  H igh  Prec i s ion  Track  
Track reports-  (Buckley, 1998, 1999a) 
TREC-6 was the first running of the high preci- 
sion track. The task in the track was to retrieve ten 
relevant documents for a topic within five minutes 
(wall clock time). Users could not collaborate on a 
single topic, nor could the system (or user) have pre- 
vious knowledge of the topic. Otherwise, the user 
was free to use any available resources as long as the 
five minute time limit was observed. The task is an 
abstraction of a common retrieval problem: quickly 
find a few good documents to get a feel for the topic 
area. 
Since the track guidelines put no limits on who the 
user could be, an implicit assumption of the track is 
that the runs were performed by system experts. As 
such, the track provides an upper-bound on the ef- 
fectiveness obtainable by the systems. The 5-minute 
time limit was selected so that the intrinsic effective- 
ness of the system, the system efficiency, and the user 
interface would all be tested by the task. 
The TREC-6 high precision track used the same 
50 topics and document set at used in the TREC-6 
ad hoc task. Five groups participated in the HP 
262 
track, submitting a total of 13 runs. The mean over 
50 topics of the precision after ten documents were re- 
trieved ranged from a high 0.6020 to a low of 0.3360. 
The least effective runs were a set of completely au- 
tomatic runs submitted to see how automatic runs 
would fare; the results confirm that user involvement 
is indeed beneficial. However, the best result was a 
run in which the user simply provided yes/no rele- 
vance judgments as input for a sophisticated (auto- 
matic) relevance feedback algorithm. This suggests 
that user involvement does not need to be extensive 
The TREC-7 high precision track used the same 
50 topics and document set as used in the TREC-7 
ad hoc task. Four groups participated, submitting a
total of seven runs. One finding of the track was that 
retrieving 15 good documents i a simple enough task 
for current retrieval systems that disagreements be- 
tween the searcher and the assessor egarding what 
constitutes a relevant document bounds performance. 
However, new time-based evaluation measures intro- 
duced in the track offered a possible solution. 
6 .5  The  In teract ive  Track  
Track reports-  (Over, 1997, 1998, 1999) 
One of the first tracks to be started in TREC, the 
interactive track studies text retrieval systems in in- 
teraction with users and is interested in the process 
as well as the results. Effectively supporting the users 
of a retrieval system has become an increasingly im- 
portant problem as more and more text is made elec- 
tronically accessible, and larger numbers of end users 
(as opposed to a relatively small group of trained 
intermediaries) perform searches. Yet designing re- 
trieval experiments that can be fairly evaluated and 
that produce interpretable results when humans are 
included in the loop is especially challenging since it 
is difficult to isolate the effects of the different factors 
that contribute to overall effectiveness. 
Interactive xperiments include a third factor, the 
searcher, to the topic and retrieval system factors in- 
herent in all retrieval experiments. An ideal experi- 
mental design tests all combinations of all settings of 
all factors with repetitions, but with human subjects 
such a design is not feasible within a single site and 
certainly not across sites. For example, the same user 
cannot perform a search for a topic more than once 
be.cause the experience gained during the first search 
biases the second search, but logistics prevents ran- 
domly assigning searchers from one site to perform 
searches on another site's experimental system. Find- 
ing a sufficient number of subjects is also difficult: ex- 
perience indicates that reliably detecting significant 
system effects requires relatively many searches. Un- 
fortunately, reducing the number of required searches 
by narrowing the focus of the investigation makes 
generalizing any conclusions difficult. 
Based on the lessons learned from the TREC-4 
track on how difficult it was to fairly compare results 
in interactive xperiments, the track concentrated on 
experimental design in TREC-5. Unfortunately, the 
final design was not decided until late in the TREC 
cycle, and only two groups were able to participate. 
However the same design was used in TREC-6. 
The goal of the TREC-6 interactive track was to 
compare systems across sites. To this end, the track 
developed and employed a new method for compar- 
ing interactive IR systems across different sites. The 
method involved comparing the particular retrieval 
system used at a site (an experimental system) to 
a common control system that was also run at each 
site. The direct comparison between the experimen- 
tal and control systems was used to derive a measure 
of how much better the experimental system was than 
the control, independent of topic, searcher, and any 
other site-specific effects. Different experimental sys- 
tems could then be indirectly compared across sites 
relative to the common control. 
The experiment used six slightly modified ad hoc 
topics and the Financial Times newspaper data as 
the document collection. The searcher task involved 
six searches (three on control, three on the exper- 
imental system) to find and save documents which 
taken together contained as many answers as possi- 
ble to the question stated or implied by the topic. 
Nine participants used this experimental framework 
to pursue their own research goals, and to contribute 
data to a cross-site comparison of systems. The eval- 
uation measures used were recall and precision de- 
fined in terms of the set of all possible answers as 
determined by NIST assessors. Participants also re- 
ported extensive data on the characteristics of each 
searcher and of each searcher's interactions with both 
the control and experimental system. 
As a first step in analyzing the cross-site data, the 
best model for each site's results in terms of which 
factors and interactions to include was determined. 
Then a cross-site analysis of variance (ANOVA) was 
performed, which indicated that there was a signif- 
icant difference between some systems. However, a 
multiple comparisons test (Tukey's), run to deter- 
mine which systems differed, found no significant 
pair-wise differences. 
The effectiveness of using a control system to re- 
move the site effect from cross-site comparisons was 
263 
an assumption of the track design and so could not be 
tested by it. Additional experiments before and af- 
ter TREC-6 did address the effectiveness of the con- 
trol (i.e., the equivalence of the direct and indirect 
comparison of systems) but neither confirmed nor re- 
futed its effectiveness (Lagergren & Over, 1998; Swan 
& Allan, 1998). As a practical matter, it is difficult 
to justify the cost of adding a control system to an 
experimental design in the absence of clear positive 
evidence for its effectiveness. 
The TREC-7 track used a similar experimental 
framework, but without the requirement to use the 
single control system. The framework both defined 
a common task for participants to perform and pre- 
scribed an experimental matrix. The search task used 
the title and description sections plus a special "In- 
stances" section of eight ad hoc topics; the documents 
searched were the Financial Times collection from 
Disk 4. The topics each described a need for infor- 
mation of a particular type such that multiple distinct 
examples or instances of that information were con- 
tained in the document collection. The searchers job 
was to save documents covering as many distinct an- 
swers to the question as possible in a 15-minute time 
limit. The NIST assessor for the topic made a com- 
prehensive list of instances from the documents sub- 
mitted by the track. The effectiveness of the search 
was evaluated by the fraction of total instances for 
that topic covered by the search (instance recall) and 
the fraction of the documents retrieved in the search 
that contained an instance (instance precision). Par- 
ticipants were also required to collect demographic 
and psychometric data from the searchers, and to re- 
port extensive data on each searcher's interactions 
with the search systems. 
The experimental matrix defined how searchers 
and topics were to be divided among the experimen- 
tal and control systems. (Participants were free to 
choose whatever systems they wanted to serve as ex- 
perimental and control. That is, the track did not 
attempt o coordinate cross-site comparisons or test 
particular hypotheses.) The matrix was based on a 
latin square design, which provides the desired uncon- 
taminated estimate of the difference between the sys- 
tems. The minimum experiment defined by the de- 
sign required eight searchers, with each searcher per- 
forming four searches with each of the two systems. 
The eight-searcher minimum was imposed since the 
results of the TREC-6 track suggested that with eight 
topics at least eight searchers are required to obtain 
statistically significant results. 
Eight groups participated in the interactive track, 
performing a total of ten experiments. Since compar- 
ison of systems across sites was  not supported by the 
experimental design, the results of the track need to 
understood in the context of the particular research 
goals of the individual research groups. 
6.6  The  Query  Track  
(Track report-  (Buckley, 1999b)) 
The query track was a new track in TREC-7 whose 
goal was to create a large query collection. The 
variability in topic performance makes it impossi- 
ble to reach meaningful conclusions regarding query- 
dependent processing strategies unless there is a very 
large query set--much larger than the sets of 50 top- 
ics used in the TREC collections. The query track 
was designed as a means for creating a large set of 
different queries for an existing TREC topic set, top- 
ics 1-50. 
Participants in the track created ifferent ypes of 
queries from the topic statements and/or relevance 
judgments. A query of a given type was created for 
each of the 50 topics, forming one query set. Five 
different query types were used: 
Very  short :  two or three words extracted from the 
topic statement. 
Sentence:  an English sentence based on the topic 
statement and the relevant documents. 
Manua l  feedback:  an English sentence based on 
reading 5-10 relevant documents only (by some- 
one who doesn't know the topic statement). 
Manua l  s t ruc tured  query:  a manually con- 
structed query based on the topic statement 
and relevant documents. The use of operators 
supported by the participant's system was 
encouraged. The  T IPSTER DN2 format was  
used to represent the query structure. 
Automat ic  s t ruc tured  query :  a query con- 
structed automatically f rom the topic statement 
and  relevance judgments.  T IPSTER DN2 
format used to represent the query structure. 
Participants exchanged the query sets they created 
with all other participants in the track, and  all partic- 
ipants ran all query sets their system could support. 
The  document  set used for the runs was  the docu- 
ments  on Disk 2 plus the AP  collection on Disk 3. 
The  retrieval results were submitted to N IST  where  
all runs were judged and  evaluated. 
Since the track design included all groups running 
all query sets, a number  of direct compar isons were 
264 
possible. First, participants could see how effective 
their system was using their own queries. Second, 
they could see how effective their search component 
was when using other queries, and finally, partici- 
pants could evaluate how effective their query con- 
struction strategies were by seeing how other groups 
fared with their queries. 
Unfortunately, only two groups participated in the 
query track, too few to make any meaningful compar- 
isons. The track will run again in TREC-8, with the 
hope that heightened awareness of the problems the 
query track is addressing will generate participation. 
6 .7  The  Confus ion  Track  
(Track report-  (Kantor & Voorhees, 1997)) 
A confusion (or data corruption) track was run in 
TREC-4 and TREC-5 to investigate the problems 
with using "corrupted" data such as would come from 
OCR or speech input. The TREC-4 track followed 
the ad hoc task, but using only the category B data. 
This data was randomly corrupted at NIST using 
character deletions, substitutions, and additions to 
create data with a 10% and 20% error rate (i.e., 10% 
or 20% of the characters were affected). Note that 
this process is neutral in that it does not model OCR 
or speech input. Four groups used the baseline and 
10% corruption level; only two groups tried the 20% 
level. As was somewhat expected, the 10% error rate 
did not hurt performance in general and the track 
results were somewhat inconclusive. 
In TREC-5, the test data was actual OCR output 
of scanned images of the 1994 Federal Register. Five 
groups participated in the experiment designed to ex- 
plore the effect different levels of OCR error has on re- 
trieval performance. This time a new task was tried: 
known-item searching. In this task the participants 
searched for particular previously identified docu- 
ments in three versions of documents. The three ver- 
sions of the documents were the original documents, 
the documents that resulted after the originals were 
subjected to an optical character recognition (OCR) 
process with a character error rate of approximately 
5%, and the documents produced through OCR with 
a 20% error rate (caused by down-sampling the im- 
age before doing the OCR). The five groups tried very 
different methods, with the group from the Swiss Fed- 
eral Institute of Technology (ETH) (Ballerini et al, 
1997) performing the best, using a type of expan- 
sion of possible candidate words to improve the best 
match score. 
It was decided to migrate the confusion track to 
the speech area in TREC-6, where it was called the 
Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) track. The SDR 
track is a successor to the confusion track in that it 
represents a different form of "corrupted" documents. 
Instead of retrieving documents that are the result 
of OCR, systems retrieved ocuments that were the 
result of speech recognition systems. 
6 .8  The  Spoken Document  Ret r ieva l  
(SDR)  T rack  
Track reports- (Garofolo, Voorhees, Stanford, & 
Jones, 1998; Garofolo, Voorhees, Auzanne, Stanford, 
& Lund, 1999) 
The SDR track fosters research on retrieval 
methodologies for spoken documents (i.e., recordings 
of speech). It was run in both TRECs 6 and 7, using 
different document sets and different asks. 
The TREC-6 document set was a set of transcripts 
from 50 hours of broadcast news originally collected 
by the Linguistic Data Consortium for DARPA Hub- 
4 speech recognition evaluations (Garofolq, Fiscus, & 
Fisher, 1997). Three versions of the transcripts were 
used: a "truth" transcript hat was hand-produced; 
a transcript produced by an IBM baseline speech 
recognition system; and a transcript produced by the 
participant's own speech recognition system. Doc- 
ument boundaries were given in the hand-produced 
transcript, and the same boundaries were used in the 
other two versions. While recognizing fifty hours of 
news presented a serious challenge to the speech sys- 
tems, the resulting document set was small by re- 
trieval standards, consisting of only 1451 stories. 
Like the earlier confusion tracks, the task in the 
TREC-6 SDR track was a known-item search. In a 
known-item search, the goal was to retrieve a sin- 
gle specific document, rather than a set of relevant 
documents. The search simulates a user seeking a 
particular, half-remembered document. NIST cre- 
ated 50 topics, each designed to describe precisely 
one document. Half of the topics were created to 
target speech conditions, and half to target retrieval 
conditions. Within each half, half were designed to 
be easy and half difficult. Difficult speech conditions 
included background noise, non-native speakers, low- 
bandwidth channels, and the like. Difficult retrieval 
conditions included the use of synonyms (e.g., cinema 
for movie theater) and rare senses of common words 
(e.g., looking for the document describing cigarette 
pants when many stories were about cigarette smok- 
ing). 
Thirteen groups submitted SDR track runs. The 
results uggested that speech recognition and IR tech- 
265 
nologies are sufficiently advanced to do a credible job 
of retrieving specific documents. The better systems 
were able to retrieve the target document at rank 
1 over 70% of the time using their own recognizer 
transcripts, compared to the best performance on the 
truth transcripts of 78.7%. Search performance was 
a bigger factor in the overall results than recognition 
accuracy, although the best results were obtained by 
groups that included both speech and IR experts. 
The TI:tEC-7 track implemented a full ranked re- 
trieval task. The document collection consisted of 
transcripts of approximately 100 hours of broadcast 
news programs, representing about 3000 news stories. 
Participants worked with four different versions of 
the transcripts: the reference transcripts, which were 
hand-produced and assumed to be perfect; the first 
baseline transcripts, which were produced by a base- 
line speech recognition system running at about 35% 
word error rate; a second set of baseline transcripts, 
produced by the baseline recognizer running at about 
50% word error rate; and the recognizer transcripts, 
which were produced by the participant's own recog- 
nizer system. Document boundaries were given in the 
hand-produced transcripts, and the same boundaries 
were used in the other versions. 
NIST created a set of 23 topics, which were used to 
search each of the versions of the transcripts. The dif- 
ferent versions of the transcripts allowed participants 
to observe the effect of recognizer errors on their re- 
trieval strategy. The different recognizer runs provide 
a comparison of how different recognition strategies 
affect retrieval. To make this comparison as com- 
plete as possible, participants were encouraged to re- 
trieve using other groups' recognizer transcripts as 
well. These runs are called cross-recognizer runs. 
Eleven groups participated in the TREC-7 SDR 
track. The results of the track displayed a linear 
correlation between the error rate of the recognition 
and a decrease in retrieval effectiveness, a correlation 
that was not present in last year's track that used a 
known-item search task. Not surprisingly, the corre- 
lation is stronger when recognizer error rate is com- 
puted over content-based words (e.g., named entities) 
rather than all words. 
6 .9  The  Very  Large  Corpus  (VLC)  
T rack  
Track reports- (Hawking & Thistlewaite, 1998; 
Hawking, Craswell, & Thistlewaite, 1999) 
The VLC track explores how well retrieval algo- 
rithms scale to larger document collections. In con- 
trast to the ad hoc task that uses a 2 GB docu- 
ment coliection, the first running of the VLC track in 
TREC-6 used a 20 GB collection, while the TREC-7 
track used a 100 GB document collection. 
The TREC-6 track's corpus consisted of 7.5 million 
texts for a total of 20.14 GB of data, including the 
five TREC CDs; USENET news postings; Canadian 
and Australian Hansards; HTML-formatted docu- 
ments including university websites, and laws and 
judgments from the Australian Attorney General's 
Department; and the Glasgow Herald and Financial 
Times newspapers. The TREC-6 ad hoc topics were 
used. 
Because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient rele- 
vance judgments for recall-based measures, the main 
effectiveness measure used for VLC runs was preci- 
sion after 20 documents were retrieved. Also reported 
were query response time; data structure (e.g., in- 
verted index) building time; and a cost measure of 
number of queries processed per minute per hard- 
ware dollar. Participants were required to submit 
two runs: one run over the entire VLC corpus and a 
second run over a baseline collection that consisted of 
a random 10% sample of the full corpus. The focus 
of the evaluation was on the ratio of the measures 
between the baseline and full corpus runs. 
Seven groups submitted VLC track runs. All of the 
participants were able to complete the VLC task with 
the hardware available to them (i.e., no special hard- 
ware purchases were made for the track). Indeed, the 
major conclusion of the track is that current systems 
are able to obtain good (high precision) retrieval ef- 
fectiveness on a 20 GB collection with reasonable re- 
sources. For example, one of the best runs, from the 
University of Waterloo (Cormack et al, 1998), re- 
trieved an average of 12.8 relevant documents in the 
top twenty processing at the rate of 2678 queries per 
hour using a cluster of four commodity PCs. 
The TREC-7 collection consisted of World Wide 
Web data that was collected by the Internet Archive 
(ht tp : / /www.arch ive .org) .  The track used the 
TREC-7 ad hoc topics, and a set of relevance judg- 
ments produced by assessors at the Australian Na- 
tional University. Because of the difficulty of getting 
sufficient relevance judgments to accurately measure 
recall, the main effectiveness measure used for VLC 
runs was precision after 20 documents were retrieved. 
To more accurately measure the effect size has on 
the retrieval systems used by the participants, the 
track provided 3 collections: the original 100 GB col- 
lections plus 1% and 10% subsamples. Participants 
indexed each of the three collections and ran the en- 
tire topic set on each. They then reported timing 
266 
figures for each phase as well as the top 20 retrieved. 
The main evaluation measures were precision after 
20 documents retrieved (the effectiveness measure); 
query response time (elapsed time as seen by the 
user); data structure (e.g., inverted index) building 
time (elapsed time as seen by the user); plus a com- 
bination timing measure that factored in the expense 
of the hardware used. 
Seven groups participated in the TREC-7 VLC 
track, with six groups processing the entire 100GB 
corpus. The track demonstrated that processing a
100GB corpus is well within the capabilities of to- 
day's retrieval systems. Of particular note was the 
Multitext group that achieved sub-second query pro- 
cessing time while maintaining ood retrieval effec- 
tiveness using hardware that cost under US$100,000. 
6 .10  The  Natura l  Language Process -  
ing  (NLP)  T rack  
(Track report-  (Strzalkowski & Jones, 1997)) 
The NLP track was started in TREC-5 to explore 
whether the natural language processing techniques 
available today are mature enough to have an im- 
pact on IR, and specifically whether they can offer 
an advantage over more conventional methods. Four 
groups participated in the initial running of the nat- 
ural language processing track. 
The TREC-6 track used the 50 TREC-6 ad hoc 
topics and a reduced ocument set consisting of just 
the Financial Times newspaper data. The track had 
limited participation, with just two groups submit- 
ting NLP runs. 
To date, specific NLP processing has not proved es- 
sential to obtaining effective retrieval in TREC. The 
most useful NLP techniques for text retrieval gener- 
ally have been methods that recognize and normal- 
ize names and other multi-word terms. However, the 
TREC topics do not require processing at this level of 
detail. Other information seeking tasks such as fact 
extraction or story summarization may be a more ap- 
propriate test of current NLP technology. 
6 .11  The  Database  Merg ing  Track  
(Track report-  (Voorhees, 1997)) 
The database merging track had the goal of in- 
vestigating techniques for merging results from the 
various TREC subcollections (as opposed to treat- 
ing the collections as a single entity). This type of 
investigation is important for real-world collections, 
and also to allow researchers to take advantage of 
possible variations in retrieval techniques for hetero- 
geneous collections. 
The track" was started in TREC-4, with 3 partici- 
pating groups, running the ad hoc topics separately 
on each of the 10 subcollections, merging the results, 
and then submitting these, along with a baseline run 
treating the subcollections as a single collection. The 
10 subcollections were defined corresponding to the 
various dates of the data, i.e., the three different years 
of the Wall Street Journal, the two different years of 
the AP newswire, the two sets of Ziff documents (one 
on each disk), and the three single subcollections (the 
Federal Register, the San Jose Mercury News, and the 
U.S. Patents). 
If results are produced without use of collection 
information, then the merging process is trivial. Cer- 
tainly this is one method of handling the problems 
of merging results from different databases. However 
this precludes using information about the collection 
to modify the various algorithms in the search en- 
gine, and, even more importantly, it does not deal 
with the issue about which collection to select. An 
implied question in this track was the hypothesis that 
one might want to bias searching towards certain col- 
lections. 
There was a second running of the database merg- 
ing track in TREC-5, again with only three groups 
participating. This time the data was split into many 
more (98) databases, to allow testing of database se- 
lection methods. Unfortunately this proved to be a 
high-overhead track and thus did not attract much 
participation despite a general interest in the prob- 
lem. The track has not been run since TREC-5. 
7 THE FUTURE 
The final session of each TREC workshop is a plan- 
ning session for future TRECs--especially to decide 
on the set of tracks for the next TREC. Two new 
tracks are planned for TREC-8, a question answering 
track and a Web track. The question answering track 
is designed to encourage research on methods for in- 
formation retrieval as opposed to document retrieval. 
The goal in the track will be for systems to produce 
short text extracts that contain the answer for each 
of a set of 200 questions. The goal in the Web track 
will be to investigate whether links can be used to 
enhance retrieval. The track will use a 2GB subset 
of the data collected for the VLC track and a typical 
TREC ad hoc task. Also, participation in the query 
track is encouraged, since the benefits of that track 
increase with increased participation.
