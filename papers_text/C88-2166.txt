Abstract 
Although every natural language system needs 
a computational lexicon, each system puts different 
amounts and types of information into its lexicon 
according to its individual needs. However, some 
of the intonnation eeded across systems is shared 
or "identical" information. This paper presents our 
experienc~" in planning and building COMPLEX, a 
computational lexicon designed to be a repository 
of shared lexical information for use by Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) systems. We have 
drawn primarily on explicit and implicit informa- 
tion fi'om machlne-readable dictionaries (MRD's) 
to create a broad coverage l xicon. 
1. The Computat ional  Meta -Lex icou  
\]'here is growing awareness among computa- 
tional linguists that much of the information 
needed for lexical entries across systems is basically 
shared or "identical" information /lngria 1986, 
Zaencn 1986/. An example for verbs is subcategor- 
ization hffonnation (transitive, intransitive, takes a 
that-complement), and selectional features (takes a 
human object, selects for inanimate subject); an 
example for nouns is gender (female, male). It 
should be possible for much of this shared informa- 
tion to be collected into a large "polytheoretical" 
data base for use by individual systems. This 
lexicon (sometimes called a "recta-lexicon") would 
consist of the overlapping set of the various attri- 
butes, features, characteristics, etc., that are necded 
by all or most NLP systems. Each system could 
then consult he repository of infonnation stored in 
the central lexicon and extract he informatkm it 
might need. The extracted information could be 
enhanced by theory-specific and application-specific 
information. Thus, instead of each system dupli- 
cating efforts, the computational "recta-lexicon" 
gathers together lexical information for use by pro- 
grams, in the same way tlmt traditional dictionaries 
contain information for use by people. 
One of the goals of the Lexical Systems 
project at IBM is to desigu and build such a 
lexicon. We have called the system COMPI~EX 
(for COMPutational H;.Xicon). Although this is 
an ambitious goal, we believe that careful 
lexicographic, linguistic, and computational 
research will permit us to represent whatever infor- 
mation is common to most NLP systems in a 
neutral representation a d in a uniform data struc- 
ture so as to be compatible with a range of require- 
ments of natural language systems. 
Corollary to the goal of designing and 
building a data structure containing information for 
different NLP systems is tile goal of broad cov- 
erage. Indeed, until recently, the lexicon was not 
tile primary focus of most natural anguage proc- 
essmg (NLP) projects. \]'he result (with a few 
exceptions) has been a proliferation of descriptively 
rich syntactic and semantic analyzers with 
impoverished lexieal coverage. Many NLP systems 
have small hand-built lexicons, hand-tailored to the 
idiosyncrasies of formatting and processing required 
by the system. Our aim is to extract inh)rmation 
automatically or semi-automatically using machine- 
readable sources, and in this way to achieve broad 
coverage. Currently, our primary resources are 
machine readable dictionaries although we have 
plans to expand to text corpora in the near future. 
Initially, we restrict our attention to building 
F.nglish lexicons but there is good evidence that 
some inlbrmation may be transferable to computa- 
tional lexicons for other languages via bilingual dic- 
tionaries. 
2. Applications 
The initial impetus for building a computa- 
tional lexicon arose from the needs of the CRI- 
TIQUE text-critiquing system (previously called 
EPISTLE, Ileidom et al 1982). Basic syntactic 
information such as part of speech, subcategori- 
zation for verbs (e.g. trans, intrans, complement 
taking properties), irregular forms, some inherent 
semantic information (such as male, female for 
nouns), some graphemic, phonological, and stylistic 
B15 
features were gathered from a range of (primarily) 
maelfine-readable sources. This system (called 
UDICT, the ultimate dictionary) is described in 
Byrd 1983 and Byrd et al 1986. A modified 
version of the original dictionary is still in use by 
that project. 
Our experience in attempting to build a solid 
broad-coverage computational lexicon revealed to 
us the range of projects potentially in need of such 
a lexical resource. Unfortunately, it also revealed 
to us a range of problems. First, the projects: we 
received requests for information from NIA' 
projects such as the experimental English-to- 
German machine translation system I,MT 
/McCord 1988/, the natural language data hase 
query project TQA/Damerau et al 1982, Johnson 
1984/, the kind-types Knowledge Representation 
system KT /Dahlgrcn and McDowell 1986/, and 
others. In fact, the LMT system uses UDICT for 
lexicon back-up when the LMT lexicon does not 
contain or does not analyze an item/McCord and 
Wolff 1987/. The analyses output from UDICT 
are compiled into LMT internal format for use by 
LMT. This is exactly the use we envision for 
COMPLEX. 
In addition to use by NLP systems, some of 
the information in COMPLEX might be used 
directly by lexicographers to aid in creating 
lexicographers' workstations for projects such as 
dictionary building and machine-assisted trans- 
lation. It could also be useful to psycholinguists 
seeking lists of words with particnlar lexical proper- 
ties for test materials. /Taft mad Forster 1976, 
Cutler 1983/. Since COMPLEX is machine read- 
able, it is a simple matter to extract lists with 
selected features. 
Some of the problems that arose as a result of 
our experience in attempting to build and provide a 
solid broad-coverage computational lexicon for 
NLP projects are discussed in the next section. 
Most important is the problem of polysemy. We 
realized that until the problem of sense distinctions 
is tackled, may computational lexicon will be of 
limited usefulness. The other problem particular to 
using machine readable dictionaries is the Mapping 
problem, also discussed below. 
3. The Polysemy Problem and The 
Mapping Problem? 
Each entry in UDICT consists of lists of feao 
tures and attribute-value pairs. There is one list for 
each part of speech. For example, the word 
"claim" has two parts of speech in U1)ICF: 
1. claim(NOUN SING AXNT IzACTVE TOV 
STOREI) (STRUCTURE < * > N)) 
. elaim(VERl3 PLI.JR TRAN AXNT PRES 
INF THATCOMP STORED HUMSJ 
COH,I1UMSJ IIUMF, XPSJ (STRUCTURIE 
< *>V)) 
In this case, "claim" is morphologically simple so 
the STRU(TI'URE value is tim same as the input 
word. 
The polysemy problem arises because of the 
fact that there is only one list of features ~permitted 
for each part of speech. The question is to decide 
what features to put into the feature bundle. This is 
not a trivial matter but there are several options. 
One is to put only those features that apply to ~dl 
senses of a word, that is, the intersection of the set 
of features for each sense. Another would be to list 
the un#m of all features for each sense. Of course, 
there is the option of representing different senses 
of a word, with the corresponding set of features, 
but then this brings along another more funda- 
mental problem: what is a sense? 
Consider a system such as that reported in 
Boguraev 1986 and 1987 in which sense distinctions 
are in fact made. The grammar development 
system, intended for a GPSG-style parser, utilizes 
the grammatical codes in the ixmgman Dictionary 
of Contemporary English /1978/, henceforth 
I,I)OCE, as the basis for fisting of feature?value 
sets. llowever, notice that tiffs system is forced to 
accept the sense distinctions from I,I)OCE, for 
better or for worse. Similarly, the project 
described in Wilks et al 1987 uses LDOCE defi~ 
nitions as the basis for lexlcal semantic structures. 
Semantic information is to be extracted from dic- 
tionary entries in LI)OCE to build sense frames. 
These structures (with sorne enhancements) are to 
provide the basis for knowledge-based parsing. 
Both project s are pursuing important paths in NLP 
research, and in particular in the use o1' machine 
readable dictionaries. However, each is constrained 
by the sense distinctions dictated by  LDOCE. 
LDOCF, is a small dictionary, so there are many 
distinctions omitted. Furthermore, often important 
grammatical distinctions ate merged for the sake of 
From now on, the term "features" is used to apply to both features and attribute-value pairs in UDICI'.

space. As human readers, we may be able to 
decode such abbreviatkms, but it is doubtful that 
compt~tecs are capable of such interpretation. Take 
for example, the entry tbr the verb "button": 
but ton  (v) 
TIt I0; c lot :h ing;  Subj : l{mnan; 
DO: Movcmble So i id  
? go (cm~ae to )  c loae  or fast:err w i th  
but tom; :  to  but ton  (up) one 's  sh i r t  
My sh i r t  doesn ' t  bot ton  (up) eas i ly?  
The entry is listed as requiting a human subject, yet 
tlm CXarmple sentence has the surface subject "shirt/' 
The problem here is that the underlying Agent i~ 
'7~uma~/' but not the surface subject. Regular 
altematkms like this are sometimes captured 
hnplicifly ia the definition in the fomt of the parew 
thcsized ~(cause to)", but this is in no way explicit 
in the dictionary resource. A detailed study of the 
semantic odes for subject from H)OCE is givet~ 
below. 
'Fo sum, there are various solutions lo the 
problem of senses, each of them inadequate in one 
way or another. The solution to list only the inter- 
section of fi~atures (the approach in most of 
UDICT) or the solution to list the ration of t'ca~ 
tures (taken for the verbs in IJDICI') does not 
capture the fact that difibrent senses et 'a  word 
exhibit different syntactic behavior, hnportant 
information is obscured mid omitted .by these 
approach,~s. On the other band, the solution 
chosen b:? Wilks et al 1987 or by Boguraev 1986 
and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided 
by LDOCE. But this then requires a system to 
adopt LDOCE senses, even when they are ineomo 
pletc or incorrect. In order to use more than one 
MRD, a way te map senses in one dictionary onto 
senses in another is required, since sense dis? 
tinctkms across dictionaries rarely correspond. 
Altemativdy, one could compose a set of ideal data 
structures~ and thcn hunt in various resources, 
including dk:tionarles, for informatiou which cotn- 
pletes the required lields. This is the proposal set 
forth in Atkins 1987, 2and it is the route we arc cur.- 
rcntly pursuing although our results arc still too 
prellminmy to be reported.

Note that there are three distinct data sets. Each of 
these structures will be described in turn. 
4.2 Lexieal Systems. 
In the example above, the Lexical Systems 
data show four feature types: two MORl'Hological, 
one PHONological, nine SYNTACTIC and one 
SYSTEM feature. Other feature types not shown 
in this analysis are SEMANTIC, STYLISTIC, 
and GRAPHEMIC. The two morphological fea- 
tures (MORPH) give the irregular inflectional 
attribute-value pairs for the past and past participial 
forms of the verb (PAST brought) and 
(PASTPART brought). The next feature is 
phonological (PHON); AXNT means that the 
word is accented on the final syllable. In the case 
of "bring" the word is monosyllabic, but in a word 
like ,,"persuade" the AXNT feature distinguishes 
word initial from word final stress. This 
phonological feature is needed for some 
morphological rules in English2 The next nine fea- 
tures are syntactic: "bring" can start multi-word 
constructions such as "bring about" 
(MWESTART); it is an infinitival form (INF), and 
it is inherently irregular IRREG; its number is 
PLUR; it subcategorizes as a di-transitive 
DITRAN (i.e. it takes two objects), takes an 
NPING and NPTOV complement, and that it is a 
transitive verb; its tense is PRES. The SYSTEM 
feature STORED shows that the word iS stored in 
our database rather than resulting from analysis by 
our affixation and compounding rules. 
The data structure displayed under the 
Lexieal Systems Analysis (LexSys) is based on 
UDICT. As shown in the example above for 
"claim", UDICT data is an tmstructw'ed list of fea- 
tures and attribute-value pairs, This output is then 
structured into a feature hierarchy according to 
feature type. There are six categories at the top 
level: SYNTACTIC, PHONological, 
MORPHological, SEMANTIC, STYLISTIC, and 
GRAPHEMIC. Features are then listed under part 
of speech for each category, and there are up to five 
levels of depth. This has important implications 
for feature addition, since the system needs to 
forbid occurrence of certain features under certain 
nodes. For example, THATCOMP cannot apply 
to determiners in English or MALE cannot be an 
inherent property of verbs in English, although a 
verb could have the contextual property of selecting 
for MALE arguments. The arrangement of the 
data in a structure also permits efficient querying. 
Thu,;, if an application requires only one type of 
feature, such as phonological or syntactic, this 
feature set is easily extracted from the larger data 
structure. 
4.3 Brandeis Codes for "bring" 
The Brandeis Codes subcategorize "bring" for 
direct object (DO). Furthermore, if the verb takes 
a DO with the preposition "to" (Pl0), then it also 
takes an NP. If an indirect object is present (IO), 
then so is a DO. Finally, "bring" will take a DO 
following by an indirect object introduced by "to"; 
this code is not intended to apply to other uses of 
"to ". 
Observe that, like the features for UDICT, 
Brandeis Codes represent the intersection of subcat~ 
egorization properties of verbs. There are about 
900 verbs, 28 features, and 19 prepositions or pre- 
position types. The codes characterize some 
inherent features (such as "Modal"), control proper? 
ties, and contextual features (such as ACCING 
"accusative followed by -ing phrase). Cases where 
combinations of features are required are indicated 
in the codes. 
Note also that there is some overlap of infer- 
marion between the Lexical Systems analysis and 
the Brandeis analysis, such as SUISCAT(TRAN) 
and DO. This is a clear example of identical infor- 
mation in different systems. By gathering together 
different computational lexicons into one general 
repository, we can both eliminate duplication when 
two systems overlap, and increase coverage when 
they differ. Of course, we will also need methods 
for resolving disagreements when they arise. 
4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword 
and part of speech; these two values hold for each 
subsequent sense. Then entries are broken into 
sense numbers. In this example, sense one has the 
grammatical codes of "DI" (ditransitive verb used 
with two or more objects) and "T 1" (transitive with 
one object when used with the prepositions "to" 
and "for"). There is no subject area, (such as "mode 
icine", "mathematics", law"), nor are there any 
selectional restrictions. Next follows the definition 
and example sentences, which are included for the 
purpose of helping the human user. They are not 
relevant to a computational lexicon except as a 
potential source of implicit information. (See 
Atkins et al 1986). 
BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the 
accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes. 
We decided to undertake an in-depth study of 
selectional restrictions for subject to get some con- 
crete data on how precise and thorough the 
I~,IDOCE codes really are. This study is described 
in the next section. 
5.  Evaluat ing the Semant ic  Codes  in  
LDOCE 
5.1 Melhodology 
Selectional restrictions for verbs specify that 
argument(s) of that verb must have particulm' 
semantic properties, .as opposed to subcategori- 
zation information which simply tells whether the 
verb can take a certain number of arguments, or 
can occur in a certain syntactic ontext. Our posi- 
tion on selectional restrictions is close to that of 
Jackendoff 1987: "...a selectional restriction ... is 
part of the verb's meaning and should be fully inte- 
grated into the verb's argument structure." (p.285) 
Although our computational lexicon is far more 
surface-structure oriented than that required by 
? Jackendoff, the spirit of the claim still applies. We 
do not yet have a distinct level of Izxical Concep- 
tual Structure/Jackendoff 1983, Levin, to appear/. 
Sclectional restrictions can be as peculiar and 
varied as the entire conceptual and semantic system 
of a language. For this reason, we picked "subject" 
because all sentences require subjects at some level; 
we picked "human" because all systems eem to 
agree on the need tor this feature, 
The machine-readable form of LDOCE is 
enhanced with a set of codes called "Box Codes". 
There are ten fields of information in the Box 
Codes giving such information as register (e.g. 
informal), or dialect (e..g. Scottish). For verbs, 
three of the fields gwe semantic selectional 
restrictions on the arguments ubject, object, and 
indirect object. 
To illustrate, the following are the two lines 
of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; 
there is one line for each sense in the dictionary 
entry. 
admire  < . . . .  It . . . .  Z<v<Wv4 ; TI>( fo r )<< 
admire  < .... }I .... Z<v<Wv4;  T I<< 
The subcategorization information in these codes, 
such as "TI" for "verb followed by NP" or "Wv4" 
memfing "occurs in the gerundive for the adjectival 
form", is what Boguraev 1986 has used in con- 
verting intbrmation front LI)OCE to more tradi- 
tional subcategorization formats. In addition to the 
grammatical codes; there are ten fields for further 
information. These fields are shown between the 
lirst two '< '  signs in the previous figure. Each 
field has letter code, or a '.' for no code. For verbs, 
field five gives selectional restrictions on subject, 
field ten on direct object, and field eight on indirect 
object. In the example above, "I!" is "lluman", 
and "Z" is "Unmarked (no semantic restriction)." 
The box codes are only available in the machine- 
readable version of the dictionary. 
In order to extract a list of verbs from 
LI)OCI~ that was truly likely to require human 
subjects in all senses, a constraint was imposed. 
Only those verbs that are marked with an "lI" in 
position iive for all senses were considered. This 
technique yielded a list of 2323 candidate verbs. 
Each of the verbs was subjectcd to six tests 
reflecting observations about what could count as a 
human subject, and observations about syntactic 
variations. Test one was for collective human 
nouns such as "chorus", "class". Test two was for 
human actions; this applies to machines uch as 
"robot" or "computer" which are not necessarily 
humanoid but easily anthropomorphosized, l:rame 
three tested human-expression ouns such as 
"film", "article", in which case the noun usually 
refers to the person behind the work. The next test 
cheeks to see if a singular human subject is 
required. The fifth test is to check for cases like 
"button" where human applies to agent role, but 
the theme or object can still appear in surface 
subject position. Finally, we observed that many 
of the verbs Ifl)OCE claims select for human 
subject actually take any animate subject. This is 
particularly applicable to biologically based activ- 
ities, such as "gag". To sum,

Simple substitution frame tests wcrc constructed to 
insert a properly inflected version of the verb to be 
tested into a set of six representative sentence 
frames. Judgments on grammaticality were stored 
in a matrix: 
abcde  f 
admire  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  + - + - - 
car icature  . . . . . . . . . .  + - + + ~ 
gag  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  + - - + 
\[319 
Features reflecting the judgment patterns were then 
generated from this matrix. Only the relewmt fea- 
tures are shown in the folk)wing figure: 4
1. admire : (VERB +I tUMSJ  +COLL I IUMSJ )  
2. caricature: (VEP, B + IIUMS.I 
+ COLLHUMSJ  + I IUMEXPSJ) 
3. gag: (VERB +I IUMSJ  +COLLHI,  JMSJ 
+ ANI MS J) 
5.2 Results 
The next figure summarize the results of tile 
judgqnents on these verbs/ 
LDOCE 
Broad 59% 
Narrow 36% 
Animate 13% 
Rejects  28% 
n=2323 
Broad = Human, Human Collective, 
IIuman Expression, Human Action 
Narrow = Human, Human Collective 
We were disappointed that only 59% of these verbs 
required human subjects in all senses. There may 
be several reasons for this: LDOCE is small so 
many senses are omitted; the "button" type verbs 
were listed as requiring human subjects; and verbs 
requiring animate subjects were listed as requMng 
human subjects. We suspect hat what may have 
happened is that the question was asked of these 
verbs "is a human subject possible?" rather than "is 
a human subject necessary?" 
This data shows that the Box Codes in 
LDOCI3 have to be carefully re-evaluated before 
they can be used. llowever, it is not our intention 
to witch-hunt in LDOCE. The dictionary is 
immensely useful, particularly since it is based on a 
detailed and thorough grammatical analysis of 
English/Quirk and Greenbaum 1972/. Rather, our 
goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer. With 
this more positive goal in mind, we took the erie 
ginal list of 2323 verbs which select R)r human 
subject fi'om Id)OCE, and used it as the basis to 
explore whether the list could be expanded using 
other tools we have:developed. Although our 
results are limited, it must be remembered that 
wilhout tim I,DOCE box codes, we w(mld have 
had no seed list. 
6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
6.1 Methodology 
Our goal in the second study was to use the 
LDOCF, list of 2323 verbs said to select for human 
subject as the basis to discover other verbs which 
select for human subject. We compared the results 
above with two other methodologies: 
I. hnplicit Information in Concept llicrarchies 
(Taxonymies) 
2. Implicit Information from Morphological Clues 
The first technique used clues fi'om the defi~ 
nitions themselves. Chodorow, Byrd, and l leidom 
1985 devised a methodology to construct 
taxonymlc hierarchies based on tile genus tcnns of 
definitions in Merriam 1963. Two procedures are 
based on tile taxonym files: Sprouting and Fil- 
tering. In brief, Sprouting uses concept hierarchies 
to add words of a semantically related field to a 
seed list. Filtering is a method to enlarge a list of 
words in terms of the heads of their definitions/ 
We had used Filtering in tim past to augment lists 
of nouns with a given inherent feature, such as 
I IUMAN. Ilowever, we had never b6tbre tried to 
filter with a list of verbs with a given sclectional 
feature. If our results were good, we would have 
some proof of tim hypothesis that ge,ms terms 
rellcct certain properties of their corresponding 
headwords. More specifically, we would have evb 
deuce that selectional restrictions may be inherited 
fi'om hypernyms just as are inherent features. Our 
results show that this hypothesis i correct. 
Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran 
Filter on our taxonym fles, and extracted 312 can.. 
didate human subject verbs. Each of these verbs 
Obviously, more detail would be needed to capture tile fact that a verb like ~gag" requires an animate subject 
with a wind-plpe. Can a virus gag? 
There is some degree of' error throughout rinse judgments. What is needed is a large number of diflbrent 
people giving such judgments. However, I will assume that the errors are equally distributed tlwoughout tile 
data, and thus can be assumed for now to be neutralized. What we have at the very least is a complete and 
thorough account of at least one person's ideoleclical intuitions on human subject verbs. 
Filtering was used in later parts of the procedure when we started with small seed lists to be used to label 
nouns which were human_collectlve, human_.expressions, etc. We did not use lilterlng for verbs. 
820 
was subjected to the same six tests, and matrices of 
properties were constructed. Interestingly, since 
Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE, 
many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were 
quite esoteric. These verbs are also less 
polysemoos, probably as a result of their being less 
comm(m. 
For compariso,l and curiosity, we also tried 
t~sing a more risky method. Morphology is oftet~ a 
chin to .';ema*ltie lbatures, both of tim base and of 
ttm deri,ed word? Under the assumption that the 
nonfinalizing ~er suffix in English sometimes marks 
agentivity, and in order to test the hypothesis that 
tile verbal bases of these agentive nouns might have 
a tendency to select tbr human subjects, we 
extracted about 4000 nouns ending in -er from a 
large (100,000+) word list. Then we sent these 
rJouns through our morphological analyzer to 
extract those with verb bases. Of the over 1000 
nouns which had verb bases, 712 were not already 
on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering. These 
verbs were added to the candidate list of possible 
verbs selecting tbr human subjects. Although wc 
knew that ~slng the multiply ambiguous -er suffix 
was more speculative, we decided to follow through 
with our experiment so we could get a measure of 
how usethl the technique is. 
~o2 Res~Is 
Tim next figure summarize the results of tim 
judgments on these verbs in comparison with the 
previous results: 
LDOCE FILTER -e~ 
Broad 59% 45% 20% 
Narz'ow 36% 25% 8% 
Animate 13% 1,4% 21%

Na_~.',,~ow =~ ~%lmax b Human Collective 
Not snrp~ishlgly, the best source of verbs which 
select re, Human Subject in all senses was 
t,D()CE. However, remember that the candidate 
verbs were supposed to select for Human Subject 
in a~t senses, yet only 59% of these verbs really 
con~brmed to that rcqtfirement. The next result 
concerns lqltedng. Nearly half of the verbs pro~ 
posed by Filtering were acceptable. This gives 
some interesting irtsights into the internal organiz.a,~ 
tim, of Merriam 1983. It shows that gent, s terms 
reflect ce~qtain properties of their corresponding 
hcadwords. More spedtically, there is some erie 
deuce that seh:cfional restrictions may be hfiterited 
from hypemyms just as are inhe,'ent li:atures. A 
result like this wonkt be greatly strengthened if 
sense distinctions were made, rather thau requh'ing 
that the restriction apply to all senses. Finally, not 
smprisingly, the morphological method gave the 
worst results. Only 20% of the candidate verbs fir- 
filled tbur of the six tests. 
7? Futm'e 
There are many other ways to tap maclfine.~ 
readable sources that we would like to try. Con-. 
cerning subjects, we would like to extract data from 
text corpora to confirm (or refute) our intuitions on 
the verbs we tested. We would also like to use 
example scr, tcnces to verify hypotheses about 
lexical Ibatures. As shown above "button", e?ample 
sentences often contradh:t claims in the Box Codes. 
l\[nformation about verbs, such as "button", which 
pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject 
might bc implicit in LDOCE. We are working to 
develop a mechanism to enable mitosis when sense 
division is motivated either by semantic or syntactic 
facts. We are also expkn~ing mechatfisms to use 
several dictk)naries to get maximum coverage. Wc 
are working on a practical solution to the mapping 
problem (see Byrd et al 1987). 
The COMPLEX system has been imple- 
mented and incmporated into the WordSmith 
on-line dictionary system, described in Nell" and 
Byrd 1988, wlfich allows flexible access to diction? 
:.tries stored as DAM ~ files and lexical data bases. 
IJltimately, COMPLEX structures will be placed in 
a lx~xieal Data Base so they can be queried by the 
Ivxical Query Language /Nell" et al 1988/. We 
intend to expand our data structures as we itlcorpo- 
rate more and different iulbrmation into ore' lexical 
repositoo,. The goal is to create a rich cemputao 
fional lexicon that can be utilized by NLP systems. 
We are working intensively on a practical solution 
to both the polysemy problem and to the mapping 
problem as they apply to  the construction of 
COMPLEX. 
"/ DAIVt ("Dictionary Access Method") is an access method subsystem which gives programs ~hst and coaven o
tent access to large files of inlbrmation associated with set.n of keys.
