Abstract 
A log.ical recasting of  B.inding Theory is performed as 
an enhancing step tor the purpose ot its gull and lean 
declarative implementation. A new insight on 
sentential anaptioric processes i  presented which may 
suggestively be c%ptured by the slogan binding 
conclitions are me effect of phase quantification on the 
universe of discourse referents. 
Introduction 
Due to its central role in natural language and its 
intriguing propert.ies, reference and anap'hor resolution 
has been a central topic for NLP research. Given the 
intensive attention devoted to this subject, .it can 
however be said that sentential anaphor orocessmg has 
been quite overlooked, when compared io the amount 
of research effort put in tackling non sentential 
anaphoric dependencies. This tends to be so because 
there seems to be a more or less implicit assumption 
that no substantial difference xists between the two 
~cesses  1. 
ile this may be arguably true for. the heuristics 
involved in picking out a given antecedent from a list 
of suitable candidates, a more s.ubtle point asks. itself 
to be made when we focus on the syntactic onditions 
which sentential anaohoric relations comply with, but 
from which non senfential ones are exempt. 
In theoretical linguistics these grammatical conditions 
are grouped under the hea.ding of BindingTheory.. In 
computational linguistics however, tlaoug.n there have 
been a few papers directly concerned with me 
implementation of this theory, mainstream research 
tends t 9 disregard its conceptual, grammatical or 
practical modularity. When it comes to define me 
algorithm. .for.setting up the list of suitable candidates 
from which the antecedent should be chosen, binding 
conditions, holding just at the sentential evel, are 
most otten put on a par with any other kind of 
conditions, morphological, semantic, pragmatic, etc.~ 
which hold for anaptioric relations at both sentential 
and non sentential level. 
The interesting p.oint to be made in this connection is 
at, it the modularity ot grammatical knowledge is to 
be ensured in a sound reference resolution system, 
more attention should be paid to previous attempts of 
implementing, Binding Theory.. It would then become 
ewdent that mis theory, in its current formulation, 
appears, as ,a , piece of formalised grammatical 
KnowJe~age wnicn nowever escapes a full and lean 
declarative implementation. 
In fact, implementation efforts concerning Binding 
Theory 2bring to light what tend to be eE!ipsed by. 
mainstream clean theoretical formulations ot it. Behind 
t.he apparent declarative aspect of its definition under 
the form ot a set of binding principles(plus definitions 
of associated concepts, e.g. o-command, o-bound, local 
IAs entry points into bibliography vd References in Grosz etal .  
(95) and Botley et al (96). 
-'Vd. Chomsky(81 ), Correa(88), lngria et al(89), Fong (90), Giorgi 
et al (90), Pianesi (91). 
domain, etc.), there is a set of  procedures which turn 
out to be an essential p.art ot the theory: after parsing 
being completed, (it in~lexation: assignln.dices to NPs; 
(ii) filtering: store the indexed tree it the indexation 
respects binding principles, reject otherwise; (iii) 
recursion: repeat (i)with a new assignment until all 
possible assignments are exhausted. 
T.his sort of resistance to declarative encompassing is 
also ap.oarent when one considers how Binding Theor Z 
is hani:lled in grammatical theories developed on top ot 
constraint based formalisms and particularly concerned 
with computational implementa'bility, lille LFG or 
HPSG. 
As to HPSG, it has passed quite unnoticed that its 
Binding Theory is the only piece of the grammar 
fragment not encoded in its own formalism. In the 
Appendix of the foundational book (Pollard and Sag 
~9"4)), where the fragment of grammar developed along 
tts 700 pp. is encoded in the adopted formalism, 
Binding Theory_ escapes such encoding. Bredenkamp 
(96) and Backot'en et al. (96) subsequent elaboration on 
this. is.sue jmplied that som. e. ki.'nd pf essential 
limitation ot the tormallsm might have been reacnea 
and that H PSG. Binding Theory is still waiting to be 
accommpdate~ into HPS.G grammars . . . . . .  
As tO the UP~ tormulaUon ot t~lndmg lneory, it 
requires the integration of inside-out equations, a 
sp6cial purpose extension to the general'declarative 
fbrmalism. And even though initial scepticism about 
their tractabili.ty was dissipated by Kaplan and 
Maxwell \[88), the recent survey, of l~acKoten et al (96) 
repo.rts that no implementeH formalism, and no 
implemented grammar, is known to handle LFG 
Bin.ding Theory.. . . . . . .  
In this connection the central aim ot the research to De 
pres.ented here is to render possible a lean declarative 
implementation f Binding Theory in constraint based 
formalisms without resorting to specific complex 
mechanisms. This involves two steps. First, as a sort 
of enhancing step back, a new account, of Binding 
lheory, is set up. Second, by the exhibition ot aft 
example~ the new shape of the theory is shown to 
support full declarative implementation in basic HPSG 
formalism. Due to sp.ace constraints, this .paper is 
mostly concerned with the first, while the latter 
receives just a rough sketch in last section, being 
develope~l in future papers. 
1 Preliminaries 
1.1 The Square of Opposition 
Recent cross linguistic research, e.g. Xue, Pollard and 
Sag (94) and Branco and Marrafa (97), ILas shown that 
the binding ability of long-distance renexives.is not 
reducible to recursive concatenation of short distance 
relations, as it has been assumed in GB accounts, but 
that it is ruled by a fourth binding principle: 
(1) Principle Z 
An o-commanded anaphoric pronoun must be o-bound. 
181 
(2) Z: B: 
x is bound compatible x is locally free 
. I  
contradictory 1 implies 1 contradictory 
C: contrary A: 
x is free x is locally bound 
This new perspective on long-distance reflexives had 
an important impact in the whole shape of Binding 
Theory. Branco and Marrafa noted still that the four 
principles can be arranged in a classical Aristoteli.an 
s~uare at oppositions, as in (2). This su~zgests hat the 
Binding Theory may have an unsuspec'(td underlying 
q uantificational structure. The present paper aims at 
snowing that there is such structure and at determining 
its basic lines. 
1.2 Phase  Quant i f i cat ion  
Barwise and Cooper (81) seminal work gave rise to a 
uitful research tradition where Generalised Quantiller 
Theory has been applied to the analysis of natural 
land e " " =uagq.uant~ficanon. These authors uggested that a 
universal characterisation f NL nominal quantification 
could be formally given by means of ,formal prop, erties 
defined in that theory. Th.'e property to live on was 
postulated as being the most prominent one~ 
admittedly constituting the common specific nature at 
all nominal quantifiers. 
L.ater, Loebner (87)suggested a criterion to ascertain 
the quantihcat,onal nature at natural language 
expressions in general. That is the property that, for a 
one place second order operator Q expressed by a given 
exc~ression, there be a corresponding dual operator 
THls'duality-"?- based perspective on the essence of natural 
langua,,. ,.~, e quantificauon permitted to extend 
quann~fication su orted 19 the determiners all, some. 
canon well beyond the classic cases of nominal 
q PP . . most many, etc., namely ~y covering also the realms 
of tempora'litv and Doss'ibility. Moreover, items like 
still/ already, , and others (enough~too, scaling 
adjectives, man)/few, etc.) though they do not lend 
themselves tobe straightforwardly analysed in terms of 
set .quantification, they can alsob.~ arranged in asquare 
of duality. The formalization at the semantics at these 
aspectua\] items by Loebner led tq the enlarging of the 
notion at quantincation through the introduction at the 
new concept of phase cmantification. 
He noted that still and alreaclv express duals m2,,d that 
they are corners,of a square of,d, uality. Let P be she is 
asleep" and -P 'she is awake', durative propositions 
which are the arzuments of the semanuc operators 
corresponding to aTready and still. Then: 
(3) She is already asleep iff 
it is not the case that she is still awake. 
ALREADY P iff - STILL -P 
Further similar tests can be made in order to show that 
these aspectual items enter the following square of 
duality: 
(4) inner 
still negauon .not yet 
/q  , 
e OU ~r  OUt ~" negauon/ dual | negauon 
no longe)  ~ '~- - -~ ~ a l ready inner neganon 
In order to ~et a formalization of (4), Loebner noted 
that alreac~,.should be taken as convey.in~ the 
information that there is a phase of not-P which has 
st a(ted before a given reference time tO and might be 
IOllOWeO lay at most one phase P which reaches tall tu. 
This can be displayed in a time axis by means of the 
diagram in (5). 
(5) tO tO 
1 
' "~ ' " ' " ' - "  ~ t 
P -P ~p P 
still P not  yet P 
tO tO 
P -P ~p P 
no longer  P a l ready P 
Similar diagrams for the meaning of the other 
aspectual phase quantitiers at this square of duality are 
easily intemretable. Inner negation results in 
exchanging the positive and the negative semiphases, 
while outer negati9n c.oncerns the.decision whether the 
parameter to tails Into the hrst or the second 
semiphase. 
Phase quantifiers in general (already, scaling a.djectives, 
etc.) . were thus characterised as requiring two 
ingredients: (i) a property P, which defines a positive 
phase in a sequence of two opposi\[e phases; (ii) a 
p.arameter point. The four types at quantifiers just 
~liffer in presupposing that either the positive or the 
negative semiptiase,co.mes fir t_and in stating that the 
parameter point tm~s rata the tirst or into the second 
semiphase. . . . . 
Next Loebner showed that the semantics of phase 
~oUantifiers sketched in the diagrams above can be 
rmalised in such a way that" a square of duality 
formed b~, the generalised q.uanti.fiers XX.some'(D,X~/ 
XX.every (D,X) turns out to t~e su.bjacent to the square 
of duality of already~still. In order to do it, he just 
needed the auxiliary, notion at starting, point at the 
relevant semiphase. This is rendered as the intimum at 
the set of the closest predecessors o f  the parameter 
po.i.nt pt which, forman unint.errt~pted linear sequence 
w~th property P, or ~P (.termed Libl(K,pt) lay Loelaner): 
(6) GSI(R,pt) =df inf{x I x<pt & R(x) & 
Vy(x<y<pt & R(y) --~ Vz(x<z<y ----~ R(z)))} 
The semantics of the four ohase quantifiers above can 
then. be rendered in the following way, making pt=tO 
tar the parameter point and R=P or R=-P: 
(7) still: XP.every'(X x.(GSI(P,a)<x<t0),P) 
already: XP.some'(X x.(GSI(-P,a)<x<t0),P) 
not yet: XP.no'(Xx.(GSI(-P, a) < x < t0),P) 
nolonger: XP.not every'(Xx.(GSI(P,a)<x<t0),P) 
2 The Log ic  of  B ind ing 
Taking Loebner's view on quantification, our goal in 
this section is to make apparent the quantificational 
structureof binding by showing that on a par with the 
square o! opposition, of (2) binding, principles form a 
,squa4".e of d.dality, we are going tDus to argue .that 
olnain.g prlnciptes are out the reflex ot the ph.ase 
quantincational nature oI corresponding nominal 
expressions: reflexives, prg.no.uns, long-distance 
reflexives and R-expressions will be shown to express 
phase quantiners acting on the grammatical 
oonqueness axis.

2.1 Phase quantification ingredients 
In order to show that the above referred nominals 
.express ,phase quantifi.ers t.he relevant .components 
mvoJvea m pnase.quantm.catlon snored t~e. mentmea. 
lne  relevant sca le  here Is not the continuous nnear 
~.rder of mo.ments o f  time, as for still~already, but a 
lscrete partla~ order made oI mscourse rererents (ct. 
DRT) arramzed according to the relative obliqueness of 
grammatical functions. Note that in multiclausal 
constructions there is the corresponding subordination 
of different clausal obliqueness hlerarchles (for the salve 
or comparalgility with diagrams (3) involving time 
arrow, Hasse dm~ams for obliqueness are displayed 
with a turn of 90~right): 
(8) Kim said Lee saw Max. 
O 
k 1 m 
Note also that the relation "less oblique than" may not 
be linear: 
(9)Kim said Lee, who saw Max, hit Norma. 
O--------O O 
k 1 n 
O O 
I m 
The sequence of two  oEpos i te  semiphases  is 
defined by a,prooerty 1-'. Contrarily to what happens 
with .alread3, wfie.r.e operator (quantifier). and o~rand 
(auraUve proposmon) are renderecl p.y mtterent 
expressions, m binding p.hase, quantification .me 
operanu r is also contnbuteO by. the nomlna~ 
expressing the operator, i.e. expressing the binding 
phase quantiner. 
For a given nominal N P is determined by the relative 
position of N in the scale . For a discourse referent r
corresponding to N, semiphase P is a linear stretch 
containingonly elements that. are less than or equal to 
r in the obliqueness order, that is discourse reterents 
correspondi.ng to. , nom in.als o-commanding N.. 
Moreover, i t  semlpnase .r Is. presupposecl to precede 
semiphase -P, P is such that the last successor m it is 
local wrt to r; and if semiphase -P  is presupposed, to
precedes semlphase P, P is such .tha.t the first 
predecessor in It is local wrt to r. In both cases tide 
closest ~ nei~hbour or semiphase -P  has to be local 
wrt r, where the notion of locality has the usual sense 
given in the definition of binding principles: 
(10) P(x) iffdef x < r & Vy\[( -P(y)& 
(x-<y or y-<x))----) x is local wrt r\] 
As to the parameter  po in t ,  in binding..p.hase 
quantification, it is the discourse reterent a winch is 
the antecedent of r. 
2 .2 Binding phase quant i f iers  
We can now formalise phase quantification subjacent 
to nominals. Let us start with an anaphor ic  
expression N like himself 
(11)Kim said Lee thinks Max/hit himself/. 
*Kim said Lee/thinks Max hit himself/. 
QA: XP.some'(Xx.(GSI(-P,a)<x<a),P) 
.a P 
o ! 
k .... 
0 
X 
C 
X 
N can thus be inte.rpreted as presupposing that a 
semiDhase -P  precedes a semipfiase P and requiring 
that the p.arameter point occurs, in the. !atter~ ttiat is, 
the antecedent a ~s to be round in .s.em~pn~e r among 
the discourse referents corresponding to Uae local o- 
commanders of r, the disc referent correspgnd.ing tqN 3. 
This is captured by_ the definition oI tide pna:s.e 
.quantifier QA. Sanstaction. of QA(P) obtains iH 
between the  bottom ot  tide uninterrupted linear 
sequence -t-' most close to me parameter 
p.omt/antecedent a and a inclusive there is at'least one 
~liscourse referent in P. Given -P.P, this amounts to 
requiring that a be in P, and that a be a local o- 
commander of r. 3 
Next, it is then easy to see how the phase 
quantificational force or a p ronomina l  expression N 
should be formalised: 
(12) *Kim said Lee thinks Max/hit  him/. 
Kim said Lee/thinks Max hit him/. 
QB:XP.no'(Xx.(GSI(~P, a) < x < a),P) 
_p ~a ~:~ p 
Here the parameter point a occurs in semiphase -P,  
which amounts to the antecedent being picked 9utside 
t,n.e set of loc~ o-commanders. QB(P). Is satisnea itt no 
discourse reterent between the bottom ot me 
uninterrupted, linear sequence -P  re.ore c.lose to the 
oarameter i~olnt/antecedent a and a Inclusive Is In r'. 
Given.-P.P, this.amount.s to requiring that a be ,in 
semiplmse ~1 ~, and mat a be not a local o-commanoer 
of r. 
Like in diagram of (11), ~P is taken here as the 
complement set oIP.  All discourse reterents which are 
not "local o-commanders of r are in it, either o- 
commanding r or not. Notice that set -P  includes also 
discourse referents Xl.vX n introduced by previous 
sentences or the extra-linguistic ontext, which in 
constructions similar to (l'2)b. accounts for possible 
aeictic readings of the pronoun. Below, when studying 
.R.-expressions~we,wlll see why. the possible non 
linearity o t  me ot~li.qu.eness orizler will led. us. to 
consider that -1: is sljglatly more complex than just 
me complement se_t ot r'._ 
Coming now to long-d is tance re f lex ives ,  ruled 
by. the fourth binding principle in (1), we get the 
following formalisation: 
(13)\[O amigo de Kim\]i disse que ele pr6prioi acha que 
Lee wu Max. (Portuguese) 
\[Kim's fr iend\]/saidLDRi thinks Lee saw Max. 
*\[O amigo de Kimi\] disse que ele pr6prioi acha que 
Lee viu Max. 
\[Kim'si friend\] said LDRi thinks Lee saw Max. 
Qz:XP.every'(X x.(GSI(P, a)<x_<a),P) 
~a P _p 
O 
I xn k 
3For the sake of simplicity, agreement requirements between N 
and its antecedent are overlooked here. 
183 
Here, like for short-distance reflexives in (11), a is 
required to occur in P though the presupposition ow 
is .t.13at semiphase P is fpIlowe.d by~ ~m.ipnase ?,r'. 
laKmg.mto account the de/m.mon oI t- m t~u), me

bottom oI the uninterrupted linear sequence V more 
close to the parameter point/antecei\[lent a and a 
inclusive every ..discourse referent is in P. This 
amounts to requmng that a be in semiphase P, and 
that a be an o-commander or r. 
Finally R -express ions  call to be formalised as the 
fourth phase quantifier of (7): 
(14) \[Kim'si friend\] said Kimi thinks Lee saw Max. 
*\[Kim's friend\]/said Kimi thinks Lee saw Max. 
Qc :hP .not  every'(Xx.(GSI(P,a)<x< a),P)

I xn k 
a) 
The parameter point a is required to occur in -P, which 
means that a cannot be an o-commander (local or not) 
of r. This renders the same condition as expressed by 
Principle C, that R-expressions be free, though it also 
encodes an uncommon assumption agout the 
referential autonomy of R-expressions. Here, like for 
other more obvious dependent reference? nominals, the 
interpretation .of l,~-expressions is. taken as being 
dependent on the interpretation ot other expressions or 
on the salience of discourse referents made available by 
the communicative context. Taking an extreme 
example in order to support the plausibility of. this 
view and awkwardly, ab'6reviate a deep philosophical 
discussion, one should notice that even a proper name 
is not a unique label of a given individual~ once 
knowing who is the person called John (out ot those 
we know that are named John) depends on the context. 
Note that like in previous diagrams, -P  is taken in 
(14) just as the complement set of P. However, QC 
asks finally for a serious ponderation o) this and a 
more accurate definition of -P  for phase quantincation 
in non linear orders, where it is possible that not all 
elements are comparable..  . . . . .  
Por t~c(P ) to be satisfied, between the t~ottom o\[ i- 
and the parameter point/ antecedent a inclusive not 
every discourse referent is in P. Since we have here the 
p.resupposition P.-P,  andgiven P is an uninterru.pted 
linear sequence, this would-amount to requiring that a 
be in -P. 
It is wortb noting then that i.f we keep -P  simply as 
the complemen.t set of r', the interpretation o !  ~- 
expressions is however not adequately predicted by 
~c(P). 
(15) John said Kimj thinks Lee saw Max. 
P -P  
a-...~l o n 
P -P  
~:  . . . . . . . . .  m 
Let D be Ix: GSI(P,a)<x<. a}~t.he domain of .Qc. 
Taking (15)b., it is easy to check that in constructiops 
like (.IS)a, D is always empty. In fact, it is not the 
case that G S.I(P,a)<a s a=xl- is not comparab.le to any 
element ot 1-', andafortiori it is not comparable to the 
bottom.of  P. Consequently, every'(D,P) is trivially 
true whatever discourse referent xn we take as 
antecedent for r, and not every'(D,P) is trivially false. 
The interpretation of.(1.5)a, sketched in (15)b. would 
thus be incorrectly ruled out. 
What these considerations eem then to suggest is 
that, when ph.ase quantification opera.tes o.n non linear 
orders, negatmn ot the ooerand r' ~s slightly more 
complex ttian sim_ple Boplean negation rendering the 
complement se.t.W..e are thus.taugm tla.at negation qf.P 
involves also the lilting ot the comolement set o~ L', 
P_L, with _1_ equal to r, the top of P, when P . -P  . It 
is easy to check with diagra..m (15)c. that this 
specification o f -P  makes it possible to satisfy Qc(P)  
in exactly the correct constructions. 
2.3 The Binding Square of Duality 
Fol!owing Loebner's claim that logical duality is the 
cardinal property to recognise the quant~hcational 
character 9f nat.ural anguage expressions, we are thus 
led to  the vmw that the interpretaUon or pon 
quantincational dennite nominals ~s...ruled by their 
phase quantincational Iorce over the obliqueness order. 
Since ~he defining formulas of binding quantiners 
result from .(7) just by assigning P the ~lefinition .in 
(10) and taking the .p.arameter point, pt to be toe 
antecedent a, ~t is w~th no su.rpnse that we get the 
following square of duality for binding quantitmrs: 
(16) ~ inner ,-, x /Z  negatmn ~/ 
~ ~ ~  ~outer outer - / dual / ne~atmn negauon/ _ _ / 
q - -  C inner Q A negation 
3 Consequences  
This new conception of binding seems to have 
important consequences not only in terms of the 
understandimz of dependent reference mechanisms 
captured by Binding Theory but also in terms of our 
conception o.f generalised quantification in natura\] 
language, of the twofold semantic apacity, ot nominal 
expressmns, referential and quantificational, and maybe 
even of the.nature of grammar devices. Here we cannot 
do but to limit ourselves to hint how a lew central 
i.ss.ues usual\]y assgciated to binding are handled, u.nder 
this new viewpoint, bet~e we proceed to bnetly~ 
consider its consequences tor the implementation ot 
Binding Theory in constraint based grammars. 
3.1 Fur ther  ins ights  into b ind ing. . .  
Parameter i za t ion  It is well known that though 
binding principles are assumed to hold universally m 
all languages, final "grammatical geometry" between 
184 
nominals and their antecedents may be different from 
lanRuage to language. .  . . . .  
Da\[ry mple (9.3) pointed out that this is.oue .to l.anguage

t.ne anteceoe.nt (wnemer it is a ~ubiect. or not) and ~l~) 
the range 9t the local domain (whether it ~s nnite, 
tensed, .etc.). As to (i), Branco and Marrafa (97) showed 
that it ~s a conseqgence of a lexical property of the 
precticates, whose ot~liqueness.hierarchy may be either 
linear or non linear. Es to (ii), t0is variation may

in particular in the de.finitiqn of loca~ w.rt tq r., to

oertectly contluent w~th. the uLi standpomt .that 
binding v.aria.tions across language are the result ot 
parameterlzatlon. 
Lexical  gaps  4 It is also well known th.at although. 
t~e tour binding principles, are claimed to be universal 
mere are. languages wnicn nave not all the 
corresponding tour type of nominals. For instance, 
English is not known fo have long-distance reflexives.

what happens in other squares of duality, it is possible

thus its own antecedent. Consequently.~, although the 
Quantification is satisfied, a '.meaningftil a.nc.hor.mg of 
the discourse referent r is still to be accomplished since 
by the sole effect of.quantification satisfaction r is iust  
anchored to itself. Admittedly, an overarching

The new conception of. Binding Theory presented in 
is paper is currently being inte~ated" in an HPSG 
grammar implemented in ProFI.T 1.54.. Space lim.its 
restrict us here to a very. prier rauonme ot .mat 
implementation, which wall be fully presented in 
tuture tpapers. 
T.he in}erestingpqint t 9 note in t.his connectip.n.is .th.at 
me new insight !nto oinmng phenomena elicited t~y 
the discovery of. t0eir qua ntin.cationa\] nature seems, to 
constitute a breakthrough tot t.ne desideratum or giving 
Binding Theory a lean declarative implementation. 
Adopting a pnnciple based semantics in fine with 
Frank and Reyle (95), the central goal is not anymore 
4 Though it is empirically not necessary, for the sake of uniformity, 
when -P.P, the order-theoretic dual of this specification of -P can 
be assumed.

fluantitlc.atlon expresse.d by .NPs is check.ed. .. . 
in practical term.s that myolves first._ collecting 
discourse reterents into set values ot specif ic teatures, 
requiring a minor extension to "HPSG feature

nature ot the elements ot a given set, in order to avoid 
termina.tion problems" some. mechanism of delaying

Conclusions 
fThoe research .reported here present a cogent ,argument 
r the quantmcatlonal nature ot sententlal dependent 
reference relations among nominals. This radically new 
conception of binding appears as a decisive step. 
~w~fls a full lean decIara.tive, encompassi_ng or 
.~inaing lneory i.n constrain.t based g.ram.mars. I t  may 
have also opened .new intriguing directions 3or the 
research on natural anguage generalised quantitl.cation~ 
on the. apEarent twolold semantic .capacity .ot 
nominals, reterential and quantillcational, or on the 
nature of grammar devices.
