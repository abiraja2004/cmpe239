1. In t roduct ion  
An automatic telephone interpreting system 
wil l  undoubted ly  be used to overcome 
communicat ion  bar r ie rs  between people 
speaking different languages. Recently, great 
interest has been growing in this area \[Saitoh- 
88\], \[Waibel-91l, \[Kitano-91\], \[Roe-92\]. SL- 
TRANS2 .1~ is an experimental system developed 
at ATR, which translates Japanese speech to 
English speech. It is composed of three basic 
components: peech recognition, translation and 
speech synthesis. This paper introduces the 
system with emphas is  on the t rans la t ion  
component. The discourse domain is a dialogue 
concern ing  an in ternat iona l  conference  
registration. The dist inctive features of the 
system are as follows. 
(1) Japanese continuous peech input can be 
recognized with h igh accuracy.  Moreover, 
speaker independent recognition using speaker 
adaptation technique has been developed. 
(2) Various expressions pecul iar to spoken 
language can be accepted and translated properly 
into the target language. In Japanese, the style of 
spoken sentences is generally quite different 
from that of written texts. Spoken utterances are 
fragmentary and include the speaker's intention 
directly or indirectly. The system extracts the 
intention and then transcribes it to a proper 
expression i the target language. 
(3) Linguistic knowledge sources necessary for 
the translation are defined declaratively to the 
extent .  Such de f in i t ion  improves  h igh  
modularity, readability and easy maintenance of 
knowledge description. 
In the next section, the system is overviewed 
and a brief description of the speech recognition 
*1) SL-TRANS2 is the extended version of SL- 
TRANS \[Morimoto-90\] 
mechanism is given. In the following three 
sections, distinctive technical features of each 
component  of the t rans la t ion  sys tem are 
described. Experiment results  are shown in 
section 6.

speech recognizer can accept any speaker's 
speech. Phone level Hidden Marker  Models 
(HMM) and syntactic rules for Japanese are 
defined in the recognizer \[Kita-90\]. By referring 
to these rules, the recognizer predicts the next 
possible phones and verifies their existence by 
matching them with corresponding HMMs. The 
process is invoked for many hypotheses in 
parallel until the end of the utterance is reached. 
Finally, the n-best sentential hypotheses are 
output, with their respective recognition scores. 
The output hypotheses are tagged with word 
information such as a part-of-speech label, then

the speech recognizer works as a kind of 
morphological nalyzer for the following analysis 
component. These hypotheses are all well-formed 
syntactically, hut not always semantically, 
pragmatically orcontextually. 
The next analysis component checks the 
validity of each hypothesis and selects the most 
plausible one*2). After analysis, some zero 
anaphora  (noun phrase  e l l ipses)  are 
supplemented using pragmatics such as honorific 
expressions in Japanese. Then, the semantics of 
the sentence is output in the form of a feature 
structure. This feature structure is generally 
composed of two parts: an intentional content and 
a propositional content. The former indicates the 
speaker's intention and is expressed in terms of 
language-independent conccpts. The latter is 
expressed in terms of language-dependent 
concepts. The subsequent transfer system 
transfers only the propositional content o their 
target language concepts. During Um generation 
process, tim two components are merged and a 
f'mal surface xpression i the target language is 
generated. Finally, synthesized English speech is 
output from the synthesizer. Currently,  a 
commercial English language speech synthesizer 
is used in the system. 
3. Ana lys i s  
3.1 Grammar  Formal i za t ion  
The grammar  formalisnl adopted was 
originally based on HPSG ( and its Japanese 
version JPSG) \[Kogure-90\]. In each lexical entry, 
syntactic onstraints, emantic onstraints and 
even pragmatic onstraints are defined as a 
feature structure (Fig.2). 
Parsing is basically accomplished using a 
unification operation between lexical items or 
successively derived constituents.  This is 
effective in parsing Japanese spoken sentences 
which have a variety of expressions. According 
to the JPSG theory, a few principles (the head 
feature principle, the subeategorization feature 
principle, etc.) and one grammar rule (a mother 
is composed of a daughter and a head) are 
*2) The contextual evaluation function is 
not yet implemented in the current system

sufficient o cover all linguistic phenomena. 
ltowever, naive implementation f the theory as 
a practical system brings an explosion of 
processing time and memory consumption, even 
for a simple sentence. To solve this problem, 
medium grained context free grammar (CFG) 
rules are introduced \[Nagata-92\]. The grammar 
rules are constructed to maintain declarative 
description of lexieal constraints and also to 
suppress unnecessary unification execution. For 
instance, the concatenation conditions between 
Japanese verbs and auxil iaries are defined 
explicitly by the rules. 
3,2 Pars ing  A lgor i thm 
Pars ing is guided by CFG ru les and 
accomplished by the unification operation as 
described above. Genera l ly ,  most of the 
processing time in a unification-based parsing 
method is consumed for the unification operation. 
In this system, besides dividing CFG rules as 
mentioned above, other efficiency improving 
technologies have been introduced. For instance, 
unification execution is delayed until all CFG 
rules have been applied. Another approach is to 
improve the unification procedure itself. In our 
system, an efficient unification mechanism using 
several techniques such as the quasi-destructive 
graph unification algorithm \[Tomabechi-91\] has 
been implemented. Using these improvements, 
tiffs system can analyze an input utterance in a 
fairly short ime. 
3.3 Zero  Anaphora  Reso lu t ion

Some zero anaphora are resolved and 
supplemented using pragmatic information in 
Japanese \[Dohsaka-90l. In general, pronouns 
indicating the participants such as "I" or "You" 
are seldom explicit in spoken Japanese. On the 
other hand, Japanese is abundant in honorific 
expressions, and such information can be used to 
interpret some zero pronouns. For instance, in 
the following example, the agent of the predicate 
"okuru" (send) in the last phrase can be inferred 
to be the speaker because he (she) is stating a 
promise and expressing it politely. Then, the 
indirect object of"okuru" is decided as the hearer, 
if the dialogue only concerns two participants.

(send-Polite~Promise) 
Other zero anaphora, especially a subject, in 
a sentence wi thout  such in format ion  is 
interpreted as the speaker. 
4. T rans fer  
Input to the transfer process is a feature 
structure indicating the semantics of an 
utterance. The feature structure is represented 
recursively using relationships. A relationship 
consists of a relationship name and its case roles. 
A relationship name is essentially a concept. In 
the analysis system, the surface illocutionary 
force type for the utterance is calculated from the 
surface expression. This is converted to an 
appropriate illocutionary force type by analyzing 
and taking into consideration the speaker's plan 
in that situation. In the current system, however, 
this conversion is done straight from the surface 
illocutionary force type because a contextual 
processing mechan ism has not yet been 
integrated into the system. Typical illocutionary 
force types establ ished for goal -or iented 
dialogues, uch as those in the target domain, are 
shown in Table 1. 
The transfer system transfers only the 
feature structure of the propositional content 
using a feature structure rewrit ing system 
\[Hasegawa-90\]. The rewriting system traverses 
an input feature structure and rewrites it 
according to a set of rewriting rules. There are

to control the application of rules instead of 
encoding explicit relationships between rules; 
when some condition is given, only the rules 
satisfying it are applied. It could also be used to 
transfer the input properly based on a given 
context. 
Another important problem in the transfer 
process i  how to disambiguate polysemous words 
and how to choose aproper target concept. In this 
system, a thesaurus of concepts is defined and 
used for this purpose. This thesaurus  is

implemented as a type system and referred to by 
related rules. 
5. Generat ion  
The basic method used in the generation 
system is also a unification algorithm. However, 
unlike the analysis system, each linguistic 
generation rule is defined for a comparatively 
large unit. This is because the variety of 
sentences tobe generated is not as great as that 
in analysis, e.g. an idiomatic expression can be 
used in certain cases. A generation rule is defined 
as a phrase definition \[Kikui-92\]. A phrase 
definition is basically composed of three sub- 
specifications as shown in Fig.4: a syntactic 
phrase structure, syntactic constraints and 
semantics, and an application environment.

Fig.4 Phrase Definition Rule 
In principle, a phrase definition is equivalent 
to a syntactic derivation rule augmented with 
semantics, other linguistic constraints and 
environmental  constraints.  Generat ion is 
executed by activating related phrase definitions 
successively which can subsume the whole 
semantics of the input feature structure. The 
validity of a combination ofphrase definitions is 
examined using the unification algorithm. 
Finally, a set of phrase definitions is determined 
and their combined syntactic structure is 
produced as a result. An environment description 
is not used in the current system, but will be used 
to generate a more appropriate xpression i  a 
given context. 
6. Exper iment  
The SL-TKANS2 system as developed so far 
can treat utterances from about 600 vocabulary 
items. It runs on a UNIX-workstation such as 
SPARC-2. Average run time for one utterance is
about one minute, half for speech recognition and 
half for translation. A preliminary experiment 
has been carried out on five dialogues, which 
include 101 sentences.  The resu l t s  are 
summarized in Table 2. Input speech material 
are specific speaker's utterances. Abilities o?

In J1 ,  the subject  of the sentence  is not

"registrat ion- fee" from the context. The system, 
however,  erroneously supplements  'T '  s ince no 
honorif ic expression appears  in the sentence. 
In Japanese  sentence  J2 ,  a ma in  c lause  
appears  later  and a pronoun "sore" (it) referr ing 
to " teuroku-yoush i"  (a registration-form} in the

re ferent ia l  re la t ionsh ip ,  and  so i t  fa i l s  to 
generate  a proper Engl ish sentence. 
As a total  system, about  84% of the sample 
sentences  are  recognized and t rans la ted  into

below.

Genera l ly  speak ing ,  it  is des i rab le  that  a

speech recognit ion output.  In our system, most  of 
such fa i lures are  f i ltered out, but  two sentences 
are t rans la ted  into Engl ish.  These undes i rab le  
outcomes are due to inadequacy  of se lect ional

7. Conclusion 
The main  features  of  the  t rans la t ion  
component of SL -TRANS2 are  descr ibed.  The 
pre l iminary  exper iment  has  shown promis ing  
results.  We are current ly  extending not only the 
vocabulary  size from 600 up to 1500, but  also the 
funct ional i ty  of the system by improv ing several  
funct ions  and  in t roduc ing  a contextua l  
processing mechanism.
