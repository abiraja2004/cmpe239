Abstract 
The centering framework explains local coherence by re- 
lating local focus and the form of referring expressions. 
It has proven useful in monolog, but its utility for multi- 
party discourse has not been shown, and a variety of is- 
sues must be tackled to adapt he model for dialog. This 
paper eports our application of three naive models of 
centering theory for dialog. These results will be used as 
baselines for evaluating future models. 1
1 In t roduct ion  
The centering framework (Grosz et al, 1995) is one 
of the most influential computational linguistics the- 
ories relating local focus to the form chosen for re- 
ferring expressions. A number of studies have de- 
veloped refinements and extensions of the theory 
(eg. Brennan et al, 1987; Kameyama, 1986; Strube 
and Hahn, 1996; Walker et al, 1998), but few have 
attempted to extend the model to multi-party dis- 
course (cf. Brennan, 1998; Walker, 1998). 
For dialog systems, the benefits of using cen- 
tering theory include improved reference resolution 
and generation of more coherent referring expres- 
sions. However, it is not at all clear how to adapt 
the theory for multi-party discourse. This paper ex- 
amines some of the issues involved in adapting the 
theory, then describes the results of applying three 
alternative models to a corpus of 2-person dialogs. 
We chose very naive approximations to the original 
theory as a starting point. These results will be a 
baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models 
in the future. 
2 The Centering model  
The centering framework (Grosz et al, 1995) makes 
three main claims: 1) given an utterance Un, the

model predicts which discourse ntity will be the 
focus of Un+l; 2) when local focus is maintained 
between utterances, the model predicts that it will be 
expressed with a pronoun; and 3) when a pronoun is 
encountered, the model provides apreference order- 
ing on possible antecedents from the prior utterance. 
These data structures are created for each \[In: 2 
1. A partially-ordered list of forward-looking 
centers Cfn that includes all discourse ntities 
in utterance n. Its first element is the 'preferred 
center ' ,  Cpn. 
2. A backward-looking center Cbn, the highest 
ranked element of Cfn- 1 that is in Cfn. 
The framework defines a preference ordering on 
techniques for effecting a topic change, ranked ac- 
cording to the inference load each places on the 
addressee. The transitions are called 'shift', 're- 
tain' and 'continue' and differ based on whether 
Cbn = Cbn+l and whether Cbn = Cpn. 
At the heart of the theory are two centering rules: 
Rule 1: If any member of Cfn is realized by a pro- 
noun in Cfn+l, Cbn+l must be a pronoun. 
Rule 2: Sequences of continues are preferred over 
sequences of retains, and sequences of retains are 
preferred over sequences of shifts. 
3 Centering and multi-party discourse 
A variety of issues must be addressed to adapt cen- 
tering to two-party dialog. They include: 
1. Utterance boundaries are difficult to pin down 
in spoken dialog, and their determination af- 
fects the Cf  lists. Just how the speaker turns 
are broken into utterances has a huge impact 
on the success of the model (Brennan, 1998). 
2. Should the dialog participants, referred to via 
first- and second-person pronouns (I/2PPs), be 
considered 'discourse ntities' and included in 
cy? 
2We provide only the briefest sketch of the centering frame- 
work. Readers unfamiliar with the model are referred to (Grosz 
et al, 1995) for more details.

3. Which utterance should be considered 'previ- 
ous' for locating Cfn-l: the same speaker's 
previous utterance or the immediately preced- 
ing utterance, regardless of its speaker? 
4. What should be done with abandoned or partial 
utterances and those with no discourse ntities. 
4 Experimental method 
Our data is from four randomly chosen dialogs 
in the CALLHOME-English corpus 3 (LDC, 1997). 
Table 1 describes the three models we created to ad- 
dress the issues described in Section 3. 
C f  elements Use both speakers' 
from I/2PPs previous utt to find Cb 
? Model 1 Yes No 
Model 2 No Yes 
Model 3 No No 
Table 1: The Centering Models 
Issue 1: Utterance boundaries We honored 
utterance boundaries as transcribed 4, even if an 
utterance was a fragment properly belonging at 
the end of the one preceding. For instance, the 
following two utterances eem as though they 
should be just one: 
Example  1 \[dialog 45711 
A ... and she called me one day when 
A there was nobody in the house but her... 
For compound sentences, we broke each non- 
subordinate clause into a new utterance. The utter- 
ance break added in Example 2 is indicated by/ :  
Example  2 \[dialog 42481 
A It does make a difference / like I always 
thought formula smells kind of disgusting. 
Issue 2: Selection of items for Cf  Two crucial 
factors in the original model are left to the algo- 
rithm implementer: the selection of items for Cf 
and their rank order? Both are active areas of re- 
search. In our models, all elements of Cf are cre- 
ated from nouns in the utterance. We do not include 
entities referred to by complex nominal constituents 
such as infinitives. Associations (eg. part/subpart) 
and ellipsed items are not allowed in determining 
elements of Cf. We adopted a commonly used 
Cf ordering: Subj > DO > IO > Other. Linear 
sentence position is used to order multiple 'other' 
constituents. Whether discourse participants should 
be considered iscourse ntities is very perplexing 
3The dialog transcripts consisted of 614 utterances, 30 min- 
utes of speech. After annotation (see issue 1 in section 4), there 
were 664 non-empty utterances. 
4CALLHOME transcribers separated utterances at a 
~e aker change or a long pause, or if the semantics or syntax of language indicated the end of an utterance. 
from a centering viewpoint (Byron and Stent, 1998). 
One of our models includes entities referred to by 
1/2PPs in C f  and two do not. 
Issues 3/4: Previous utterance Empty utter- 
ances (containing no discourse ntities) are skipped 
in determining C f,.,_l. Empty utterances include 
acknowledgements and utterances like "hard to 
leave behind" with no explicitly mentioned objects. 
The dialogs were annotated for discourse struc- 
ture, so Un-1 is the previous utterance in the dis- 
course segment, not necessarily linear order. 5 In 
model2, the highest ranked element of Cf from ei- 
ther the current speaker's prior utterance or the other 
speaker's previous utterance is Cb6; models l&3 
consider only the immediately preceding utterance. 
We also annotated the 'real' topic of each utter- 
ance, selected according to the annotator's intuition 
of what the utterance is 'about'. It must be explic- 
itly referred to in the utterance and can be an entity 
referred to using a I/2PP. 
After the three models were defined, one dialog 
was used to train the annotators (the authors) 7, then 
the other three were independently annotated ac- 
cording to the rules outlined above. The annotators 
compared their results and agreed upon a reconciled 
version of the data, which was used to produce the 
results reported in Section 5. Annotator accuracy as 
measured against he reconciled ata over all cate- 
gories ranged from 80% to 89%. Accuracy was cal- 
culated by counting the number of utterances that 
differed from the reconciled ata (including differ- 
ent ordering of C f), divided by total utterances. 8 
5 Results and analysis 
Table 2 summarizes our findings. Only 10 of 664 ut- 
terances violate Centering Rule 1, so centering the- 
ory's assumptions linking local focus to pronouns 
appear to hold in dialog. It is interesting to note that 
Model 1, which includes dialog participants as dis- 
course entities, consistently performed best in the 
categories used for this evaluation. 9 
5The authors performed segmentation together; the purpose 
of this study is to examine xtensions of centering theory, not 
discourse segmentation. 
6In case of conflict, recency takes precedence. 
7Annotators must not confer during annotation, so a training 
dialog is used to clarify unclear annotation instructions. In this 
case, the annotators examined it to agree on which syntactic 
constituents would contribute Cf elements and the criteria for 
breaking turns into utterances. 
SMore standard reliability measures could not be used since 
there are no "tags" in this annotation scheme, and within some 
categories there may be an ordered list of items.

Table 2: Comparison of three alternative centering models for dialog 
5.1 Empty Cb 's  
Each of our models leaves at least 52% of non- 
empty utterances with no prediction of the Cb 
(Cfn-1 and Cfn are disjoint). 1? Some empty 
Cb's result from abrupt topic shifts, while others 
occur when the speakers make topically related, but 
C f-disjoint, contributions, uch as the last line in: 
Example 3 \[dialog 48611 
A I just want to figure out what I'm going to do with 
my life. I feel like I'm never going to figure it out. 
B Lizzy, you might not. 
B I haven't figured out mine yet. 
In many cases, a Cb would exist if we modified the 
models to include associated and ellipsed entities 
in Cf.  For instance, in Example 4, the ellipsed 
location in A's utterance should be the Cb: 
, Example 4 \[dialog 42481 
B ... Ive been there walt, yes three times I think 
A Well this is our second time 
5.2 Cb Matches the 'real' topic 
For utterances where a Cb can be selected, it 
matches the 'real' topic only 21% to 35% of 
the time. By this measure, our models are poor 
predictors of local focus. For instance, in Example 
5, the 'real' topic of the first utterance is Jackson, 
but according to Modell the set of entities referred 
to by "we" is the Cb of both utterances. 
Example 5 \[dialog 42481 
A And like we went into Jackson, the town and / 
we were like - AAAHHHI let me out of here 
The annotators' intuitions regarding the 'real' 
topic often conflicted. It would be interesting to an- 
notate actor and discourse focus separately, then see 
which one the Cb most closely matches. 
5.3 Cheap versus expensive transitions 
Strube and Hahn (1996) propose a method of eval- 
uating a model against centering rule 2, measuring 
the 'cost' of the listener's inference load. A cheap 
transition has Cbn = Cp,- I ,  otherwise it is expen- 
sive. Models with a large percent of cheap transi- 
1?57% of Cb's in Modell are entities referred to via I/2PPs. 
tions better eflect human notions of coherence. All 
three of our models produced a very low percent 
of cheap transitions in this experiment, especially 
when compared to Strube and Hahn's result of 80%. 
6 Conclusions and Future work  
We conclude that centering behavior in dialog is 
consistent with that found in monolog. However, 
the utility of our preliminary models is question- 
able. By revising our Model 1, we believe a useful 
model of centering in dialog can be built. 
This study indicates many promising directions 
for future research. Some we intend to pursue are: 
? Evaluate the models using other criteria, e.g. 
improved pronoun resolution. 
? Experiment with alternate C f orderings and 
improve the semantic theory to include entities 
referred to by personal pronouns, associations 
and ellipsed entities in Cf.  
? Modify utterance boundaries to re-attach inter- 
rupted utterances or use Kameyama's proposal 
for 'center update units' (1998).
