I.INTRODUCTION 
We must  s t r ive  to  prov ide  d ia logue  sys tems 
w i th  ab i l i ty  to  in teract  w i th  t i le  user  in  the  k ind  
o f  cooperat ive  human- l i ke  d ia logues  o f  in fo rma-  
t iona l  type .  By th i s  type  o f  a d ia logue  we mean a 
mutual informing act iv i ty  of interact ion partici- 
pants -- s imilar to Car\]son's (1984) dialogue game of 
information sharing - aimed at enriching the stock g 
of shared (mutually coordinated) knowledge. Our 
tenet in this study is that SAAs are performed in 
dialogues to approach the general goal of shared 
knowledge. The proposed typology of SAAs re f lects  
thei r  dialogue functions and contribution i to the 
information flow process. 
Performing an SAA the speaker X conveys to the 
addressee Z the information about some actual s i tua-  
tion S, i .e .  about some part  of the 'world' which a 
topic of the dialogue refers to. It  is assumed here 
that appropriateness of the SAA is determined by 
conditions formulated in terms of contextual proper- 
t ies  of the current communicative s i tuat ion inclu- 
ding knowledge, bel iefs ,  evaluations and goals of 
interact ion part ic ipants  (van Dijk, 1984). Certain 
cognitive aspects of eommunicatlve s i tuat ion are 
considered to be a necessary precondition for SAA 
performance and simultaneously a part of SAA integ- 
ral  content. 
To simulate the cognitive s i tuat ion and repre -  
sent  in fo rmat ion  const i tuents  o f  SAA content  in  a 
par t i c ipant ' s  ( fo r  example ,  X ' s )  knowledge base  two 
cogn i t ive  components  a re  de f ined .  Let  X be a set  o f  
u t te rances  {P} wh leh  represents  a cur rent  cogn i t ive  
s ta te  o f  X (denoted  as  X :P ) .  A cogn i t ive  component  
X:Z i s  d i s t ingu ished  in  X wh ich  i s  a re f lec t ion  o f  
in X (X's bel iefs about Z's knowledge including Z's 
bel iefs about his partner X's state of knowledge), 
i .e .  a set of utterances of the form P=Z:P'. Then 
tile rest  of X is X's own knowledge about the world. 
Now M may be defined as a set of utterances simul- 
taneously contained in X, Z, X:Z and Z:X ( a weak 
def in i t ion of M).

I) the speaker's state of knowledge about S, i .e .  
tile state of X, which includes X's evaluation of his 
own knowledge; 
2) the speaker's bel iefs about the addressee's 
knowledge, i .e .  the state of X:Z.

D i f fe rent  cogn i t ive  s ta tes  o f  X are  intercon- 
nected by re lat ions regarding information flow bet- 
ween the cognitive components of X. These re lat ions 
are expressed in terms of the following set of 
ru les l :  
(I) X:P-->X:(P,vx) 
(2) X:Z:P--~>X:P 
(3) X :Z :P - - ->X:Z : (P ,vz ' ) ,  i n  spec ia l  case  vz '=?  
(4) X :Z : (P ,vz '} - ->X: (P ,vx) ,  in  genera l  case  Vz '~Vx 
(5) x:(P,vx)-->x:x:(P,vx) 
Note that (4) is an amplif ication of (2), (5) repre- 
sents the  re f lex iv i ty  o f  X. For  an  exp lanat ion  o f

The cognitive s tates  of the X:(P,vx) type d i f -  
fer In vx-values2: 
vx=l  * - X i s  qu i te  cer ta in  that  P I s  t rue  o f  S; 
vx=O * - X i s  cer ta in  that  P i s  fa l se  o f  S; 
Vx>0.5*  or  vx<0.5*  - X i s  inc l ined  P to  be eva-  
luated  pos i t ive ly  (P is rather true 
than false) or negatively; 
Vx=0.5 * - both (posit ive and negative) evalua- 
tions are equally possible; th is  in ter -  
val is a domain of fu l l  uncertainty,  
resu l t ing e i ther  from the absence of any 
information in support of or against P 
or from there being much evidence both in 
favour of and against P. 
The cognitive s tate  X:(P,vx) is a precondition 
for the performance of an SAA by X (SAA.X). Another 
necessary precondition is X's bel ief  that Z does not 
dispose of the information about S to be conveyed by 
the SAA.X. The well-known formulation " i t  is  not ob- 
vious to X that  Z knows that P" (Searle,1969) needs 
spec i f icat ion since i t  permits several in terpreta-  
t ions.  
2.2.1gnorance types. We dist inguish four 
ignorance s i tuat ions defined by comparing the 
current state of X to that of X:Z. 
A- ignorance .  X : (P ,vx) ;  X:Z+P. Cons ider ing  P, X 
be l ieves  that  P i s  not  cons idered  (o r  s imply  not  
ac t ivated)  in  Z. 
B - ignorance .  X : (P ,vx) ;  X :Z : (P ,vz ' ) ;  X :Z :X : (P ,vx ' ) ,  
Vx'#Vx or  vx '=?  P i s  cons idered  by both  X and Z. 
g be l ieves  that  v -va lue  o f  P in  Z i s  Vz' (wh ich  
i s ,  poss ib ly ,  not  equa l  to  Vx, by ru le  (4 ) ) .  X 
believes also that the correct Vx-value is unknown 
to Z, i.e. Vx'6Vx/Vx'=? ('?' has been introduced 
into knowledge representation apparatus as a meta- 
value of v-evaluatlon to account for just this 
very case of ignorance). 
C- ignorance .  X:(Pi,vix),vkx>0.5*; X:Z:(Pi ,viz),  
viz~0.S*; X:Z:X: (P i ,v ix ' ) ,v ix '+vix/v ix '=? X believes 
that the state of Z corresponds to disjunctive un- 
certa inty:  there is a set {Pi} of a l ternat ive  pro- 
posi t ional  descript ions of S in Z3, none of them 
evaluated as considerably more ver is imi lar  than the 
rest .  In X v-values of the a l ternat ives  are d i s t r i -  
buted in such a way that one of them (vkx) is posi- 
t lve.  In X's opinion, Z is ignorant of this 
distribution. 
D- ignorance .  x : (q ,v lx ) ,  vlx>0.5*; X: (P ,v2x) ,  V2x= 
l*-vlx; X:Z+Q; X:Z:(P,Vz'),Vz'>0.5*; X:Z:X:(P,Vx'), 
Vx'~V2x/Vx'=? The proposit ions contained in X and 
(in X's opinion) present a l ternat ive  descript ions 
of S. 
The type of ignorance determines a communica- 
tive goal of the SAA, this goal subordinated to the 
general goal of the cooperative dialogue. By SAA 
performance, X intends to change Z so as to bring 
about Z's beliefs of S into line with his own 
knowledge, i.e. to approximate Z to X (or, at least, 
Z:X to X, if S has to do with the 'mental world' of 
X, i.e. X). This intention, in its turn, determines 
2.n* denotes n and the scale values close to n. 
3.The v-values of the a l ternat ive  proposit ions are 
bound by corre lat ion ~vi~l* ( < is the case when 
not a l l  the a l ternat ives  are known). 
516 
a type  o f  operat iona l  change o f  Z: a)  to  inc lude  
in format ion  about  S in  Z (an  inc lus ion  operat ion) ;  
b) to exclude wrong information about S from Z (an 
exc lus ion  operat ion) ;  c) to  se lec t  one o f  the  a l te r -  
nat ive  descr ip t ions  o f  S conta ined  in  Z (a  non-  
e lementary  se lec t lon  operat ion  car r ied  out  by  means 
o f  severa l  exc lus ions) ;  d) to  cor rect  wrong in forma-  
t ion  about  S conta ined  in  Z (a non-e lementary  
cor rect ion  operat ion  car r ied  out  by means o f  exc lu -  
s ion  and inc lus ion  ) .  
3 .  SAA TYPES 
The information about the cognitive s i tuat ion 
is incorporated in the integral  information ( infor-  
mation package - IP) to be conveyed from g to Z by 
the performance of an SAA. The information const i -  
tuents of the SAA IP are d ist r ibuted between the 
three sections representing the states  of M, X:Z and 
X. Their content is formed in accordance with the 
ignorance s i tuat ion as X sees i t  by the moment of 
SAA generation. I t  is the content of M, X:Z and 
that determines a type of the given SAA. 
3.1 .Bas ic  SAA types .  In the  A - ignorance  s i tua -  
t ion  a proposit ion P and corresponding evaluative 
information Vx is put by X under Z's 
consideration. In the B-ignorance s i tuat ion i t  is 
evaluative information only that is introduced to Z. 
An opposition by the type of information introduced 
by an SAA (propositional + evaluative vs. evalua- 
tive) allows two basic SAA types, namely, Statements 
(S-SAA) and Evaluations (E-SAA), to be d is t in -  
guished. 
Statements. S-SAA is based on the assumption that 
P is not considered in Z. BV S-SAA performance, P is 
put under Z's consideration a d Vx-value of P is 
communicated to Z. In general case, M is empty 
(with respect o S): the topic P hasn ' t  been yet 
in i t ia ted  in the dialogue. 
S-SAA IP: (a) M:O 
(b) X:Z+P 
(c) x:(P,vx) 
Different Vx-values determine the S-SAA sub- 
types: Indef inite Statements (vx=0.S*), Uncertain 
Statements (0*<vx<0.5* and 0.5*<vx<l*) and Certain 
Statements (vx=0 * and vx=l*). 
Examples :  
(1) I t  seems that  John  i s  go ing  to  leave  fo r  Par i s  
to-morrow. 
(2) I am certain that Jack has passed his exam. 
(3) I don't know whether it will rain, < but I'II 
take my umbrella.> 
(4) I don't think she is married, < so it is not 
foolish for him to try to meet her again.> 
Evaluations. E-SAA is performed in the communi- 
cative situation when P has been already activated 
in M, i.e. the topic P is under consideration in the 
dialogue. No new propositional information is intro- 
duced by E-SAA. The goal of X is to introduce Vx- 
value which is not contained in Z:X, in X's opinion. 
E-SAA IP: (a) M:P 
(b) X:Z:(P,Vz') 
(c) x:(P,vx) 
(d) X:Z:X:(P,vx'), Vx'~Vx/Vx'=? 
There are Positive Evaluations (Vx>0.5*), Nega- 
t ive Evaluatlons (vx<0.5*) and Indef inite Evalua- 
t ions (Vx=0,5*). The consideration f possible oor- 
re lat ions of vx and vz' allows dist inguishing a 
number of E-SAA subtypes that are shown In f lg .1 .  Of 
spec ia l  in teres t  here  are  Acceptance  and Approva l  
cor respond ing  to  Vx=Vz ' .  The d is t inc t ions  between 
these  two subtypes  as  we l l  as  the i r  d ia logue  
funct ions  w i l l  be d i scussed  in  sect ion  4.  
Examples :  
(5) Z: I am leav ing  fo r  Par i s .  
X: a .  I see! /Are  you?  I d idn ' t  know that .  
(Acceptance)  
b.  I know that  a l ready .  
(6)  Z: I t  l ooks  l i ke  John  has  got  marr ied .  
X: a .  Rea l ly  he has!  < I 've  got  to  know h is  
wife.> 
(Strong Confirmation) 
b. I don't  think so, <he used to be a 
staunch bachelor.> 
(Weak Denial - Doubt) 
c.  I wonder!/Has he?  I d idn ' t  think so. 
(Doubt, vx=0.5 *)
3.2.Non-elementary SAA types. In certa in commu- 
nicative s i tuat ions X performs peech acts which may 
be cal led non-elementary: their  informational con- 
tent may be divided into several components (sets of 
information const ituents) each representing the 
content of some elementary (basic) speech act.  In 
the s i tuat ions of C- and D-ignorance the non-elemen- 
tary SAAs (Correction and Selection) are performed, 
their  information packages being the combination of 
IPs of the basic SAAs described above. 
Selection (pick). P-SAA is a means of selec- 
tion in the C-ignorance s i tuat ion . In the simplest 
case M contains a set of two propositions (P,Q) and 
knowledge that only one of them is adequate to S, 
i .e .  M:(P/Q,I*). By P-SAA X pos i t ive ly  evaluates Q. 
It  means a negative valuation of P, in accordance 
with the implication ((Q,vl) - ->  (P,v2), vl=l*-v2). 
so, the P.-SAA IP is a combination of two E-SAA IPs, 
one of them introducing the posit ive evaluation of Q 
and the other negatively evaluating P; a constituent 
(b) is added to the P-SAA IP and w-values are 
specif ied. 
P-SAA IP: (a) M:(P,Q) 
(b) M:(P/Q,I*) 
(e) X:Z:(P,o.5*) 
(d)  X :z : (q ,o .5* )  
(e)  X:(Q,vlx), vlx>0.5* 
(f) X: (P ,v2x) ,  V2x=l*-vlx 
(g) X:Z:X:(Q,VIx'), vlx'4vlx/vlx'=? 
(h) X:Z:X:(P,v2x'), V2x'=l*-vlx'/V2x'=? 
For example: 
(7) Z: Has Smith gone away on business or stayed 
in London? 
X: I{e has stayed, < I saw him yesterday.> 
Correct ion .  C-SAA i s  per fo rmed to  cor rect  Z in  
the s i tuat ion of D-ignorance. M contains P which is 
characterized by a posit ive v-evaluatlon in Z. 
Assuming that P is inadequate to S, X evaluates P 
negatively and introduces Q, P and Q being a l terna-  
t ive, in X's oplnion, i .e .  X:(P/Q,I*). X believes 
that this  presupposition will  be accepted or ap-  
proved of by Z (included in Z) and thus become an 
element of M. The C-SAA IP combines the E-SAA IP 
(Negative Evaluation in the Denial mode) and the S- 
SAA IP (w i th  pos i t ive  eva luat ion  o f  Q be ing  in t ro -  
duced) ;  a const i tuent  (d)  i s  added to  the  C-SAA IP 
and v -va lues  are  spec i f ied .  
C-SAA IP:  (a )  M:P 
(b)  X :Z : (P ,Vz ' ) ,  Vz '>0.5*  
(c) X:Z+Q 
(d)  X : (P /Q , I * )  
(e) x : (q ,v lx ) ,  vlx>0.5* 
(f) X: (P ,v2x) ,  v2x=l* -v lx  
(g) X@:X:(P,vx'), vx'~v2x/vx'=? 
For  example :  
(8) Z: You s tayed  at: home yesterday ,  I be l ieve?  
The nomenclature of  non-e lementary  SAAs may be 
expanded bF inc lus ion  o f  a l te rnat ive  s ta tements  
(combination of S-SAAs), select ive statements with a 
non-siugle choice (combination of E-SAAs) etc. 
4.INFORMATION FLOW AND SAA CONTRIBUTION 
In th is  section we consider the process of 
information flow in the cooperative informational 
dialogue anti discuss the role of the basic SAAs in 
this process. The prohlem of information flow is 
par t ia l l y  analyzed by Carlson (1984) who makes uc- 
cessful use of the table and private l i s t s  metaphor. 
However, the information flow scheme proposed here 
seems to be more general as far as i t  takes into 
account not only the proposit ional but also the 
evaluative const ituents of the par t i c ipants '  know- 
ledge. This allows dist inguishing a stage of mutual 
coordination of evaluations in the scheme. Figure 2 
shows several var iants of the dialogue flow of which 
certa in stages are represented by Statements and 
Evaluations. 
At the  beg inn ing  o f  the  d ia logue  the  set  M i s  
empty  ( in l ) .  The cogn i t ive  s ta te  o f  X cor responds  to  
A - Ignorance .  Th is  determines  the  appropr ia teness  o f  
S-SAA and fo rmat ion  o f  the  communicat ive  goa l  o f  
the cooperative partner X, namely, to  inform Z about 
S. X performs an S-SAA by means of which information 
about the current cognitive s i tuat ion is conveyed 
from the speaker X to his addressee Z. As a resu l t  
of S-SAA performance the cognitive s i tuat ion changes 
in the following way: P is entered in g:X and, 
consequently, in Z (by rule (2)) and in X:Z; then P 
is entered in M (by (6)) and is contained there as a 
topic of tile dialogue ( further the question of P 
wil l  not be closed unt i l l  i t s  v-evaluatlon wil l  be 
coordinated by the par t ic ipants ) ;  X:(P,vx) is en- 
tered in Z and X:Z; so, in accordance with (5) and 
(7), X's assumptions about S become mutually known 
to the par t ie lpants ,  i .e .  M:X:(P,Vx). 
The fur ther  course  o f  the  d ia logue  i s  deter -  
mined by the  s ta te  o f  Z and  by a type  o f  in fo rma-  
t iona l  cont ract  between X and  Z (see  the  not ion  o f  a 
cont ract  in  Nar in 'yan i -S imonova ,  1985) .  Th is  not ion  
regards  in fo rmat iona l  re la t ions  wh ich  ho ld  between X 
and Z, e .g .  a dominancy  o f  X over  Z, a subord inacy  
o f  X to  Z or  a neut ra l i ty  between X and Z. These  
re la t ions  determine  a degree  o f  Z ' s  conf idence  in  X 
and a degree  o f  Z ' s  se l f - conf ldence .  
Let  us  cons ider  severa l  var iants  o f  the  fu r ther  
progress  o f  the  d ia logue .  By var iant  1, p rov ided  
that  an  index  o f  Z ' s  conf idence  i s  h igh  enough,  a v -  
eva luat ion  o f  P i s  fo rmed in  Z on the  bas is  o f  Vx. 
517 
By var iant  2, the fo rmat ion  of vz does not depend 
upon vx. In any case ,  the  s ta tes  of Z (by ru le  (4 ) ' )  
and of Z:X (by ru le  (3) ,  In the B - ignorance  mode) 
change resu l t ing  in  the  precond i t ions  for  E-SAA.Z. 
The E-SAA.Z i s  immediate ly  aimed at  the a l te ra t ion  
of X:Z. By the per formance of E-SAA, Z exp l i ca tes  
the s ta te  of Z inc lud ing  Vz, a f te r  that  X :Z :{P ,vz ) ,  
and the content  of M changes cor respond ing ly ,  i .e .  
~:z:(P,vz) .  
The subtype of E-SAA.Z i s  determined by Vx and 
Vz cor re la t ion .  In case of Vx=Vz=V the subtype i s  
Acceptance (var iant  1: Z accepts  X's v iewpo int  on S) 
or Approval  (var iant  2: hav ing  the same assumpt ions  
about S, Z approves of X's v iewpo int ) .  The co inc i -  
dence of X 's  and Z 's  v iewpo ints  i s  now f ixed  in M; 
th i s  invo lves  the  cor respond ing  change of M (by ru le  
(7}}: the  top ic  P i s  c losed  and the const i tuent  
(P,v)  i s  entered  In M. So the in teract ion  i s  suc-  
cess fu l l y  completed (cur l}  by ach iev ing  the genera l  
goa l  of the cooperat ive  d ia logue:  the s tock  of 
shared  knowledge i s  enr i ched  by new mutua l ly  coord i -  
nated in fo rmat ion  about the wor ld.  
In case of Vx+Vz the subtype of E-SAA.Z i s  
Conf i rmat ion  or Den ia l .  I t  i s  obv ious that  St rong 
Eva luat ions  are  aimed at  changing the vx -va lue  in X. 
As for  Weak Eva luat ions  which express  Z 's  doubts ,  
the i r  goa l  i s  determined by a degree of Z ' s  se l f -

After Confirmation or Denial a stage of coordi- 
nating evaluations begins. On recieving E-SAA.Z, X 
may change Vx-value thus creating preconditions for 
the next in turn E-SAA.X. In this case ~3 
includes the E-SAA.X and the corresponding cognitive 
background. Provided that Z informationally domi- 
nates over X, a new vx-value is equal to Vz - so, 
the goal of the dialogue is accomplished (curl}. If 
nobody changes his v-value after one exchange of 
evaluative information (i.e. after the sequence of 
S-SAA.X and E-SAA.Z), ~3 is an argumentative 
interaction in the course of which one or both the 
participants try to prove their viewpoints by intro- 
ducing an additional supporting information (there 
are complex speech acts in ~3) .  The non-argumenta- 
tive insisting is not peculiar to the cooperative 
dialogue, it would mean going out into a kind of a 
conflict (nut 2). The above variants of the dialogue 
flow demonstrate significant distinctions between 
Statements and Evaluations as to their dialogue 
functions. The S-SAA is usually an initial dialogue 
move opening a topic of the dialogue. A secondary S- 
SAA function is to be an answer to a certain kind of 
questions ( What's happened? What's known about 
John?). Thls option is presented in the scheme by 
the dialogue beginning variant A1  which includes a 
question of Z. 
The E-SAA is a response by Its very nature. It 
reacts not only to the explicit assertive moves in 
the dialogue but also to the implicit assertions, 
e .g .  to semantic presuppositions of the previous 
speech acts. In this case the E-SAA.Z follows ~2 
including some SA.X, e.g. a yes/no qnestlon of X 
which expresses just the lack of evaluative informa- 
tion (vx=0.5*). The E-SAA.Z may also be performed in 
the context of the precedlng SA.Z which has intro- 
duced P as a non-asserted propositional constituent

of an imbedding propos i t ion  {You were in teres ted  in

5.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
In th i s  paper we have presented  a new theore -  
t i ca l  approach to a formal descr ip t ion  of SAA func-  
t ions  in  the cooperat ive  in fo rmat iona l  d ia logue .  I t  
d i f fe rs  from the prev ious  approaches in  severa l  
ways: 
- two cognitive components in a participant's know- 
ledge base are defined to represent his own know- 
ledge as contrasted to his beliefs about his part- 
ner's state of knowledge; the rules are introduced 
describing the information flow relations 
between these components; 
- propositional and evaluative constituents are 
distinguished ill individual knowledge representa- 
tion; u notion of v-eva/nation is introduced and 
types of cognitive states described; 
- a cognitive background for SAA performance is 
represented by one of four types of ignorance; 
- a typology of SAAs is proposed which distinguishes 
between basic and non-elementary SAAs; for each SAA 
type a formal representation of its informa- 
tional content is given; 
- a scheme of information flow Js presented which 
shows different dialogue functions of SAAs; in this 
scheme a stage of introducing propositional and 
evaluative information and that of coordinating 
evaluations are considered. 
The limitations of the paper did not allow us 
to present a description of the so called particu- 
lar SAAs which are opposed to the general SAAs 
described here by the scope and character of the 
propositional information under evaluation. 
The current description can be extended in a 
variety of ways: an additional research i s  required 
to define the non-elementary SAAs as a sub-class of 
complex speech acts; the dialogue scheme is also to 
he extended to include the non-elementary SAAs; the 
question of how to design a dialogue model allowing 
for types of informational contracts between the 
participants deserves further attention.
