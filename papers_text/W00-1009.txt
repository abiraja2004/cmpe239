We introduce CST (cross-document 
slructure theory), a paradigm for multi- 
document analysis. CST takes into aceount 
the rhetorical structure o f  clusters of related 
textual documents. We present a taxonomy 
of cross-document relationships. We argue 
that CST can be the basis for multi- 
document summarization guided by user 
preferences for summary length, information 
provenance, cross-source agreement, and 
chronological ordering of  facts. 
1 Int roduct ion  
The Topic Detection and Tracking model (TDT) 
\[Allan et al 98\] describes news events as they 
are reflected in news sources. First, many 
sources write on the same event and, second, the 
same source typically produces a number of 
accounts of  the event over a period of  time. 
Sixteen news stories related to the same event 
from six news sources over a two-hour time 
period are represented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 : Time distribution of related documents 
from multiple sources 
A careful analysis of related news articles hows 
that they exhibit some interesting properties 
\[Radev & McKeown 98\]. In some cases, 
different sourees agree with each other, at other 
times, the information presented in them is 
contradictory. The same source sometimes adds 
new information as it becomes available and 
puts it in the context of  what has already been 
discussed earlier. In other eases, to get a full 
picture of  an event, one has to read stories from 
multiple sources as neither of  them presents all 
relevant information. All these examples point 
to the existence of  cross-document structure that 
is waiting to be exploited. 
Figure 2 illustrates how the same story can be 
told in several different ways. The six extracts 
are from news stories about the same event: the 
declaration by Bill Clinton at a press conference 
that millions of  dollars will be handed out to low 
income people affected by recent surges in oil 
pFices. 
In this paper we introduce CST, a theory of  
cross-document s ructure. CST assigns labels 
74 
such as subsumption, update, and elaboration to
cross-document conceptual links. We argue that 
CST is essential for the analysis of 
contradiction, redundancy, and complementarity 
in related documents and for multi-document 
summarization (MDS). 
FoxNews: President Clinton announced Wednesday he will release funds to help New Englanders through the 
heating oil "crisis" and spoke on topics ranging from gun violence to his personal life and foreign policy. 
The president said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to 
help families who must rely on oil to heat heir homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year. 
ABCN~s:  President Clinton today ordered the release of  millions of dollars in assistance for Northeastern families 
struggling with soaring fuel costs, saying Americans have together to help their fellow citizens in times of need. 
The release of $120 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is to help families who must 
rely on oil to heat heir homes, he said ... 
CNN: Citing rising energy costs, President Clinton said Wednesday he is releasing $120 million in funds to help 
families buy home heating oil in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states. 
The president said lie decided the help was needed heeause steadily rising oil prices have slammed consumers 
dependent on home heating oil and have boosted the cost of,gasoline. 
MSNBC: AT A WASHINGTON, D.C. news conference, Clinton announced that he had ordered the release of the 
remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families in the Northeast hit hard by this year's cold weather 
and the soaring cost of  home heating oil. 
Clinton said lie ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help 
families who must rely on oil to heat heir homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year. 
USA Today: President Clinton, saying too many families are being hurt by the soaring cost of heating their homes, 
announced Wednesday he will ask Congress for $600 million in emergency assistance tohelp people meet heating 
oil costs. He also released an additional $125 million for more immediate help to low-income families. 
NY Times: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 - President Clinton ordered the release today of another $125 million in 
government aid to help needy families pay the soaring costs of heating their homes this winter. 
The release, announced by Mr. Clinton at the start of a White House news conference this afternoon, comes only six 
days after the government made $130 million in home-heating aid available.

2 Related Work  
2.1 Document structure 
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) \[Mann & 
Thompson 88, Mann 00\] is a comprehensive 
theory of text organization. It is based on "text 
coherence", orthe presence in "earefuUy written 
text" of unity that would not appear in random 
sequences ofsentences. RST posits the existence 
of relations among sentences. Most relations 
consist of one or more nuclei (the central 
components of a rhetorical relation) and zero or 
more satellites (the supporting components of 
the relation). An example of an RST relation is 
evidence which is decomposed into a nuelens (a 
claim) and a satellite (text that supports the 
claim). RST is intentionally limited to single 
documents. With CST, we attempt to describe 
the rhetorical structure of sets of related 
documents. Unlike RST, CST cannot rely on the 
deliberateness of writing style. We can however 
make use of some observations of structure 
across documents which, while clearly not 
deliberate in the RST sense, can be quite 
predictable and useful. In a sense, CST 
associates a certain behavior to a "collective 
document author" (that is, the collectivity of all 
authors of the related ocuments). 
A pioneering study in the typology of links 
among documents i described in \[Trigg 83, 
Trigg & Weiser 87\]. Trigg introduces a 
taxonomy of link types across cientific papers. 
The 80 suggested link types such as citation, 
refutation, revision, equivalence, and 
comparison are grouped in two categories: 
Normal (inter-document li ks) and Commentary 
(deliberate cross-document links). While the 
taxonomy is quite exhaustive, it is by no means 
appropriate or intended for general domain texts 
(that is, other than scientific articles). 
75 
A large deal of research in the automatic 
induction of document and hyperdocument 
structure is due to Salton's group at Cornell 
\[Salton et al 91\]. \[Allan 96\] presents a graph 
simplification technique for "hyperlink typing", 
that is, assigning link types from Trigg's list to 
links between sentences or paragraphs of a pair 
of documents. Allan tested his techniques on 
sets of very distinct articles (e.g. "John F. 
Kennedy" and "United States of America" from 
the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia). As the 
author himself admits, the evaluation in \[Allan 
96\] is very weak and doesn't indicate to any 
extent whether the techniques actually achieve 
anything useful. 
More recently, \[Salton et al 97\] introduced a
technique for document structuring based on 
semantic hyperlinks (among pairs of paragraphs 
which are related by a lexieal similarity 
significantly higher than random). The authors 
represent single documents from the Funk and 
Wagnalls encyclopedia on topics such as 
Abortion or Nuclear Weapons in the form of text 
relationship maps. These maps exploit the 
bushiness (or number of connecting edges) of a 
paragraph to decide whether to include it in a 
summary of the entire article. The assumption 
underlying their technique isthat bushypaths (or 
paths connecting highly connected paragraphs) 
are more likely to contain information central to 
the topic of the article. The summarization 
techniques described in Salton et al's research 
are limited to single documents. 
One of the goals of CST is to extend the 
techniques set forth in Trigg, Salton, and Allan's 
work to cover sets of related documents in 
arbitrary domains. 
2.2 Multi-document summarization 
SUMMONS \[Radev & McKeown 98\] is a 
knowledge-based multi-document 
summarization system, which produces 
summaries of a small number of news articles 
within the domain of terrorism. SUMMONS 
uses as input a set of semantic templates 
extracted by a message understanding system 
\[Fisher et al 96\] and identifies ome patterns in 
them such as chang e of perspective, 
contradiction, refinement, agreement, and 
elaboration. The techniques used in SUMMONS 
involved a large amount of knowledge 
engineering even for a relatively small domain 
of text (such as accounts of terrorist events) and 
is not directly suitable for domain-independent 
text analysis. The planning operators used in it 
present, however, the ideal first step towards 
CST. 
\[Mani & Bloedorn 99\] use similarities and 
differences among related news articles for 
MDS. They measure the effectiveness of their 
method in two scenarios: paragraph ahgnment 
across two articles and query-based information 
retrieval. None of these scenarios evaluates the 
generation of query-independent summaries of 
multiple articles in open domains. 
The Stimulate projects at Columbia University 
\[Barzflay & al. 99\], \[McKeown & al. 99\] have 
been using natural language generation to 
produce multi-document summaries. Their 
technique iscalled theme intersection: paragraph 
alignment across news stories with the help of a 
semantic network to identify phrases which 
convey the same meaning and then generate new 
sentences from each theme and order them 
chronologically toproduce a summary. 
We should note here that RST has been used to 
produce single-document summaries \[Marcu 
97\]. For multi-document summaries, CST can 
present areasonable equivalent to RST. 
2_3 Time-dependent documents 
Time-dependent documents are related to the 
observation that perception of an event changes 
over time and include (a) evolving summaries 
(summaries of new documents related to an 
ongoing event that are presented to the user 
assuming that he or she has read earlier 
summaries of related documents) \[Radev 99\] 
and (b) chronological briefings \[Radev & 
McKeown 98\]. \[Carbonell et al 98\] discuss the 
motivation behind the use of time-dependent 
documents and \[Berger & Miller 98\] describe a
language model for time-dependent corpora. 
76 
3 Representing cross-document 
structure 
We will introduce two complementary data 
structures to represent multi-document clusters: 
the multi-document cube (Section 0) and the 
multi-document graph (Section 0). 
3.1 Multi-document cubes 
Definition A multi-document cube C (see Figure 
3 (a)) is a three dimensional structure that 
represents related documents. The three 
dimensions are t (time), s (source) and p 
(position within the document). 
Def'mition A document unit U is a tuple (t,s,p) -
see Figure 3 (b). Document units can be defined 
at different levels of granularity, e.g., 
paragraphs, entences, or words. 
Definition A document D is a sequence of 
document units U1U2... Un which corresponds to 
a one-dimensional projection of a multi- 
document cube along the source and time 
dimensions. 
Some additional concepts can be defined based 
on the above definitions. 
Definition A snapshot is a slice of the multi- 
document cube over a period of time At - see 
Figure 3 (c). 
Definition An evolving document is a slice of 
the multi-document cube in which the source is 
fixed and time and position may vary. 
Definition An extractive summary S of a cube C 
is a set of  document units, S c C, see Figure 3 
(d). 
Definition A summarization operator 
transforms a cube C into a summary S.

summary 
3.2 Multi-document graphs 
While multi-document cubes are a useful 
abstraction, they cannot easily represent ext 
simultaneously at different levels of granularity 
(words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and 
documents). The second formalism that we 
introduce is the multi-document graph. Each 
graph consists of smaller subgraphs for each 
individual document (Figure 4). We use two 
types of links. The first type represents 
inheritance r lationships among elements within 
a single document. These links are drawn using 
thicker lines. The second type represents 
semantic relationships among textual units. The 
example illustrates sample links among 
documents, phrases, sentences, and phrases. 
77

relationships 
(W), phrases (P), sentences orparagraphs (S), or 
entire documents (D). The examples are from 
our MDS corpus (built from TDT and Web- 
based sources).

document relationships. The Level column

One example of a cross-document relationship is
the cross-sentence informational subsumption 
(CSIS, or subsumption), which reflects that 
certain sentences repeat some of  the information 
present in other sentences and may, under 
certain circumstances, be omitted during 
summarization. In the following example, 
sentence (2) subsumes (1) because the crucial 
information in (1) is also included in (2) which 
presents additional content: "the court", "last 
August", and "sentenced him to life". 
(1) John Doe was found guilty of the murder. 
(2) The court found John Doe guilty of the 
murder of Jane Doe last August and 
sentenced him to life.

5 Using CST for information fusion 
In this section we describe how CST can be used 
to generate personalized multi-document 
summaries from clusters of related articles in 
four steps: ehstering, document structure 
analysis, link analysis, and personalized graph- 
based summarization (Figure 6). 
The first stage, clustering, can be either query- 
independent (e.g., based on pure document 
80 
similarity [Allan et al 98]) or based on a user 
query (in which case clusters will be the sets of 
documents returned by a search engine). 
The second stage, document analysis, includes 
the generation of  document trees representing 
the sentential and phrasal structure of the 
document [Hearst 94, Kan et al 98].

Figure 7: Summarization using graph cover operators 
The third stage is the automatic creation and 
typing of links among textual spans across 
documents. Four techniques for identifying 
related textual units across documents can be 
used: lexical distance, lexical chains, 
information extraction, and linguistic template 
matching. Lexical distance (see e.g., [Allan 
96]) uses cosine similarity across pairs of 
sentences. Lexieal chains [Barzilay & Elhadad 
97] are more robust than lexical matching as 
they take into account linguistic phenomena 
such as synonymy and hypernymy. The third 
technique, information extraction [Radev & 
McKeown 98] identifies alient semantic roles 
in text (e.g., the place, perpetrator, and effect 
of a terrorist event) and converts them to 
semantic templates. Two textual units are 
considered related whenever their semantic 
templates are related. Finally, a technique that 
will be used to identify some relationships 
such as citation, contradiction, and attribution 
is template matching which takes into account 
transformational grammar (e.g., relative clause 
insertion). For link type analysis, machine 
learning using lexieal metrics and cue words is 
most appropriate (see [Kupiec et al 95], 
[Cohen & Singer 96]). 
81 
The final step is summary extraction, based on 
the user-specified constraints on the 
summarizer. A graph-based operator defines a
transformation on a multi-document graph 
(MDG) G which preserves some of its 
properties while reducing the number of 
nodes. An example of such an operator is the 
link-preserving graph cover operator (Figure 
7). Its effect is to preserve only these nodes 
from the source MDG that are associated with 
the preferred cross-document links. In the 
example, the shaded area represents the 
summary subgraph G" of G that contains all 
four cross-document links and only these 
nodes and edges of G which are necessary to 
preserve the textual structure of G'.

6 Ongoing work and conclusion 
6.1 Ongoing work 
We are in the process of performing a user 
study to collect interagreement data among 
judges who are asked to label cross-document 
rhetorical relations. 
We are also currently building a system for 
automatic identification of relationships in 
document clusters as well as a library of 
summarization perators. User preferrenees are 
used to constrain the summarizers. For 
example, a user may prefer that in the event of 
same set of input documents 
contradiction, both sources of information 
should be represented in the summary. 
Another user may have preferences for a given 
source over all others and choose an operator 
which will only reflect his preferred source. 
We will facilitate the user's navigation in the 
space of all possible summarizers. By 
specifying their preferences, users will build 
their own summarizers and test them on a 
collection of documents and then refine them 
to fit their needs. 
6.2 Conclusion 
We introduced a theory of cross-document 
structure based on inter-document 
relationships uch as paraphrase, citation, 
attribution, modality, and development. We 
presented a taxonomy of cross-document 
links. We argued that a CST-based analysis of 
related documents can facilitate multi- 
document summarization.
