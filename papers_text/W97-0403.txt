Abstract 
This paper argues that stylistically and 
pragmatically high-quality spoken lan- 
guage translation requires the transfer of 
pragmatic information at an abstract level 
of "utterance strategies". A new cate- 
gorization of spoken language phenomena 
into essentially non-meaningful "speech 
errors", and purposeful "natural speech 
properties" is introduced, and the manner 
in which natural speech properties convey 
pragmatic information is described. Fi- 
nally, an extension of the analogical speech 
translation approach is proposed that ac- 
counts for such higher-level pragmatic in- 
formation. 
1 Introduction 
Traditional grammar, at its origin highly prescrip- 
tive, was aimed at written sentences, and completely 
ignored all characteristics of spoken language. This 
distinction was codified in Chomsky's competence- 
performance distinction (Chomsky, 1965). Chom- 
sky singled out the abstract notion of grammati- 
cal competence, the rules or constraints character- 
ize grammatical sentences, as the proper subject for 
the study of language. All other characteristics of
language were relegated to the category of language 
performance, ssentially meaningless by-products of 
the system that happens to implement language pro- 
duction in humans. Traditional approaches to com- 
putational linguistics have also focused on the rules 
of grammar. 
1.1 Spoken Language 
Spoken language, however, has many characteris- 
tics that are different from written language. When 
an utterance is produced on-line, the speaker does 
not have a lot of time to think and plan the en- 
tire utterance. For this reason, spoken utterances 
tend to be relatively short, have less complex struc- 
ture, and contain more fixed or semi-fixed expres- 
sions than written sentences. At the same time, the 
on-line nature of spoken language also gives rise to 
so-called "disfluencies'. Furthermore, written com- 
munication usually aims at an accurate transfer of 
information, in an interactive mode of verbal com- 
munication, each utterance often carries larger por- 
tion of pragmatic information such as a variety of 
illocutionary and perlocutionary forces. 
1.2 Pragmatic Information 
Accurate handling of pragmatic information in 
speech translation is gaining importance as speech 
recognition technology improves. As can be 
observed in communications between a native 
speaker and an intermediate/advanced second- 
language learner, pragmatic inappropriateness in 
otherwise perfectly grammatical utterances causes 
more communicational damage than purely syntac- 
tic mistakes, since the listener tends to interpret it 
as intentional or malicious, instead of viewing it as 
a result of the speaker's linguistic incompetence. 
2 Previous Approaches: Recognizing 
Speech Act Types 
For the reasons outlined above, it is important o 
handle pragmatic information in spoken language 
translation. The most studied area in pragmatics 
has been the illocutionary force of utterances. This 
type of information has been shown to be useful for 
reducing ambiguities and improving the accuracy of 
speech recognition and translation in many systems 
(Woszczyna nd Waibel, 1994), (Nagata, 1992), (qu 
et al, 1996). 
2.1 Rule-based Approaches 
One of the traditional approaches to this area of 
pragmatics is to recognize speech act types com- 
positionally using syntactic and semantic rules plus 
16 
a few pragmatic principles, such as felicity condi- 
tions for each speech act type. Spoken language 
expressions, however, tend to deviate from conven- 
tional grammars, and a system consisting of layers 
of rule-based modules is often too brittle to han- 
dle naturally-occurring spoken input. Furthermore, 
there are a number of fully- or semi-lexicalized mor- 
pheme sequences that carry specific illocutionary 
forces but that are not totally predictable from its 
forms. These sequences have an institutionalized 
function in the particular community, and are best 
accounted holistically rather than analytically (Paw- 
Icy and Syder, 1983). 
2.2 Pattern Match ing 
Many spoken language systems have thus been us- 
ing robust pattern-matching techniques to overcome 
these problems. They use detailed, task-specific 
templates and semantic grammars, which can recog- 
nize various fixed phrases to mark speech act types 
while skipping over disflucncies in the input. This 
method has been shown to be successful in many di- 
aloguc systems (Jackson ct al., 1991), (Ward, 1991). 
3 Other Pragmatic Information 
When people engage in face-to-face dialogues, the fo- 
cus is usually on establishing and maintaining a good 
relationship among the interlocutors, rather than 
mere transfer of information. Each spoken utterance 
thus usually carries a large portion of what (Trau- 
golf, 1982) calls the expressive component, which 
expresses the speaker's attitude toward the proposi- 
tion, toward the interlocutor, and toward the speech 
situation. 
3.1 Ignor ing  Express ive  In fo rmat ion  
When spoken language understanding is performed 
in a goal-oriented dialogue system, it is usually ac- 
ceptable to strip off any "extraneous" information in 
order to map the speaker's intention onto an unam- 
biguous ystem command. This is not possible, how- 
ever, in a spoken language translation system that 
acts as a human-human verbal communication aid, 
where the expressive information encoded in utter- 
ances plays a far bigger role. For example, if we con- 
sider a conversation between two persons who meet 
for the first time at a party and extract only proposi- 
tionally meaningful chunks and translate them, the 
result will resemble an interrogation rather than a 
pleasant conversation. 
3.2 T rans la t ing  Pragmat ic  In fo rmat ion  
In our work, we take the view that important prag- 
matic information is actually encoded in many of the 
characteristics of spoken language that have been 
viewed as defective or ill-formed. We believe that 
many of such characteristics arry specific commu- 
nicative functions that must be preserved in order 
so-called 
"disfluencies" 
( 
utterance strategies 
Figure 1: Communication vs. Performance 
to obtain translations with high stylistic and prag- 
matic accuracy. We propose that the spoken lan- 
guage phenomena that have been labeled as "disflu- 
encies" or "ill-formedness" be divided into two cat- 
egories: those that serve a communicative function, 
and those that are non-communicative by-products 
of the speech production process. 
4 Communicat ion  and Per formance  
We refer to the spoken language phenomena that 
are non-communicative by-products of the speech 
production process as "speech performance errors", 
and to the phenomena that serve a communicative 
function as "natural speech properties". 
4.1 Speech  Per fo rmance  Er rors  
Speech performance errors are obvious errors not in- 
tended by the speaker and (for our purposes) not 
bearing any information. This includes errors in 
pronunciation, word selection, and structure selec- 
tion. When speech performance errors are corrected 
by the speaker within the utterance, they result in 
slip-of-the-tongue r pairs. 
4.2 Natura l  Speech  Proper t ies  
In contrast to speech performance rrors, natu- 
ral speech properties are produced intentionally by 
the speaker, and usually carry specific pragmatic, 
communicative functions. For example, inverted 
word order and repetitions usually emphasize cer- 
tain parts of the utterance. Incomplete sentences 
are often used to soften so-called "face threatening 
acts" (Brown and Levinson, 1987), speech acts that 
might have negative ffects on the listener, such as 
rejections or requests. 
4.3 Speech  Repa i rs  
Some types of repairs, in which a phrase is para- 
phrased or repeated with more information, also ful- 
17 
Figure 2: Two-level Distortion Model of Spoken 
Language 
fill communicative functions. We call such repairs 
elaborating repairs, in contrast o slip-of-the-tongue 
repairs which result from correcting speech perfor- 
mance errors. Elaborating repairs like the example 
below may signal the listener about the status of 
the speaker's internal processing, or reduce the face- 
threatening effect of the utterance. 
I gave it to you on Monday, yeah, probably 
on Monday the 27th. 
Unlike a slip-of-the-tongue repair, where the 
speaker would have deleted the original phrase had 
there be time and means, in an elaborating repair, 
deleting the phrase (on Monday in the example 
above) would result in a different effect on the di- 
alogue. 
4.4 Ut terance  St ra teg ies  
We refer to all the devices that serves pragmatic or 
communicative functions as "utterance strategies". 
They concern the speaker's intention of "how to say" 
an utterance, as opposed to "what to say" (proposi- 
tional content) of the utterance. For this reason, 
their semantics are non-truth-conditional. Utter- 
ance strategies range from grammatically-encoded 
information to extra-linguistic devices uch as facial 
expressions and body language, to natural speech 
properties (Figure 1). 
4.5 D is tor t ion  Mode l  
Based on this discussion, we arrive at the two-level 
model of spoken language phenomena shown in Fig- 
ure 2. The speaker's intention of "what to say" (in- 
tended propositional content) is combined with the 
speaker's intention of "how to say it" (pragmatic ut- 
terance strategies) to form the "intended utterance", 
which contains natural speech properties. When the 
speaker actually produces the utterance, speech per- 
formance errors might occur, resulting in the "ac- 
tual utterance" that is to be interpreted by the lis- 
tener. We believe that spoken language translation 
systems need to be able to translate what is con- 
veyed through natural speech properties in order to 
fully convey the speaker's intentions in verbal com- 
munication. 
5 Communicating Pragmatic 
Information 
This section discusses the different types of prag- 
matic information that play a role in spoken dia- 
logues. 
5.1 D iscourse  S t ructure  
One type of pragmatic information relates to sig- 
naling discourse structure. This concerns how the 
propositional content of the current utterance is re- 
lated to what the conversational participants already 
know, and to the structure of the discourse. It in- 
dicates the theme and the theme of the utterance, 
and places new or contrasting information into fo- 
cus. It may signal a new topic, or the return of an old 
topic, the speaker's attempt o hold the conversa- 
tional floor. This type of pragmatic information has 
been noted to be very important for automatically 
synthesizing utterance with appropriate intonation 
(Prevost, 1996), and for generating sentences with 
appropriate word order in free word order languages 
such as Turkish (Hoffman, 1996). 
Natural speech properties that carry the informa- 
tion related to discourse include word order vari- 
ations (inversions, right or left-dislocations), and 
filled pauses and hedges used as a floor-holding de- 
vice to signal the listener not to take her turn. Some 
interjections and hedges can be used to help the lis- 
tener prepare herself or the subsequent i formation, 
or aid the listener's processing and comprehension f 
the current utterance. 
5.2 In terpersona l  In tent ion :  Po l i teness  
The majority of utterance strategies express the 
speaker's interpersonal intentions, the main aspect 
being politeness. There are two different types of 
politeness expressed in spoken language, "discern- 
ment" and "volition" (Ide, 1989). Discernment 
refers to the speaker's ecognition of her relationship 
with the addressee and the situation. This is mainly 
expressed through the speaker's choice of conversa- 
tional topic, lexical items, and syntactic structures. 
For example, the same conversational participants 
may use different linguistic forms depending on the 
speech situation, such as a discussion during a formal 
meeting versus an informal hallway-chat after the 
meeting. The choice of formal and informal predi- 
cate forms in Japanese and the choice of distant and 
18 
familiar second person pronouns in French and Ger- 
man are examples of lexically encoded discernment 
markers. 
The volitional aspect of politeness is usually ex-" 
pressed through projection of "face". There are two 
distinct aspects of face, "positive face" and "negative 
face" in the theory of (Brown and Levinson, 1987), 
which are rephrased as involvement and indepen- 
dence, respectively, in (Scollon and Scollon, 1995). 
Positive face or involvement concerns one's desire to 
be liked by others, to be involved with others, and 
to be part of the same group. Negative face or inde- 
pendence, on the other hand, concerns one's desire 
to maintain privacy and independence, and to avoid 
the imposition or dominance of others. 
5.3 Pos i t ive  Face 
Strategies to project positive face, which are called 
"positive politeness trategies" (Brown and Levin- 
son, 1987) or "solidarity politeness" (Scollon and 
Scollon, 1995), can be carried out by the use of in- 
tensifiers accompanying positively affecting speech 
acts such as thanking and complimenting. The use 
of the first-person plural pronoun we in English is 
also an example of solidarity politeness. Most of the 
other linguistic items used in solidarity politeness 
strategies, however, do not bear propositional con- 
tent. For example, the speaker may try to appeal to 
mutual beliefs or affective common ground by using 
the English interjection you know and the Japanese 
sentence-final particle ne (Cook, 1988). The speaker 
may also try to invite the addressee's involvement 
by using hearer-oriented question tags such as right, 
all right, okay, would you or will you, or by using 
devices to attract the addressee's attention such as 
look, listen, hey and informal or affectionate address 
terms. 
Telegraphic utterances that omit obvious informa- 
tion can be interpreted as a strategy to emphasize 
common knowledge among the interlocutors. In- 
volvement strategies "assert the speaker's right to 
advance his or her own position on the grounds that 
the listener will be equally interested in that position 
and in advancing his or her own position (Scollon 
and Scollon, 1995):85". The speaker may achieve 
this by displaying an assertive, "non-challengeable 
attitude" (Kawanishi, 1994) with the Japanese janai 
form, or by aligning herself and the listener on the 
same side by using distant demonstrative ano (that) 
(Cook, 1993). 
5.4 Negat ive  Face 
Strategies to project negative face, which are called 
"negative politeness" or "deference politeness", are 
mainly carried out by the use of "toning down" 
devices accompanying negatively affecting speech 
acts such as criticizing, giving advice, requesting, 
or refusing an offer or request. Expressions of the 
speaker's hesitation or tentativeness, such as hedges 
(well, I don't know, I think, I am wondering if. . .),  
use of the interrogative form, or the past tense I was 
wondering if... or the subjunctive mood it would 
be better are examples of such devices to soften the 
force of the utterance, and to make it easier for the 
addressee to refuse. Sometimes even questions to 
ask permissions to ask a question are used to give 
the addressees ways to answer negatively without 
directly refusing the request, as shown in the follow- 
ing example given (Yule, 1996), pp.64-65: 
I know you're busy, but might I ask you 
if-em-if  you happen to have an extra pen 
that I could, you know-eh-maybe borrow? 
There are also content "downtoners" such as lit- 
tle, a bit, just, . . .  and so on, and the use of collo- 
quial expressions (such as to give a hand instead of 
to help), which trivialize the action mentioned in the 
utterance. The speaker may also try to create dis- 
tance between the addressee by avoiding reference to 
both the speaker and the addressee, as in an agent- 
less passive sentence I would like a reservation to be 
made. 
5.5 Expressing Att itude 
Another type of utterance strategy expresses the 
speaker's attitude towards the propositional content 
in the utterance. This information can be conveyed 
through various forms of evidential markers and de- 
vices to express the speaker's certainty/uncertainty, 
or the speaker's perspective. 
6 Handling Pragmatic Information 
in Speech Translation 
In the context of spoken language translation, the 
crucial characteristic of pragmatic utterance strate- 
gies is that the surface forms in which they are real- 
ized are often different across languages. 
6.1 Example: English vs. J apanese  
Politeness 
For example, softening the effect of an imperative 
force by questioning the addressee's ability to per- 
form the action (Can you do X for me ?) or assert- 
ing the speaker's desire ( I  would like you to do X 
for me) can be found across many languages. How- 
ever, strategies to further reduce the imposing effect 
of these request forms are usually not directly trans- 
ferable across languages. In English, a more polite 
way of phrasing the request Can you do X for me ? 
would be the use of the subjunctive mood, Could 
you do X for me ?, but no corresponding form exists 
in Japanese. Instead, the Japanese speaker may use 
the negative form X shire itadakemasen ka?. If this 
Japanese form is translated literally into English, the  
result would be Can't you do X for me ?, which has 
a quite different pragmatic meaning, and definitely 
does not convey the same degree of politeness as the 
Japanese xpression.

6.2 Abstract Pragmatic Transfer 
To what extent word order can be altered, and how 
easily known information can be elided, are also 
largely dependent on the syntax of each language. 
One strategy that is realized as fronting may be 
marked as intonation in another language. It is not 
sufficient, therefore, to recognize the surface form of 
each pragmatic strategy and directly transfer it to 
the same surface form in another language. Spoken 
language systems are thus required to transfer prag- 
matic utterance strategies at a more abstract level 
and to be able to recognize and generate appropriate 
surface forms in each language, in order to achieve 
high-quallty translation. In our approach, we treat 
pragmatic strategies as additional information that 
are superimposed upon basic propositional content, 
try to recognize and extract them, and transfer them 
to the appropriate target language expressions. 
7 An  Ana log ica l  F ramework  for 
T rans la t ing  P ragmat ics  
This section gives a brief overview of our approach 
to translating spoken language. 
7.1 The  Role of Lexicallzation 
Our approach to translating spoken utterances res- 
onates well with the insights of (Pawley and Syder, 
1983) about native speakers' competence and knowl- 
edge. According to Pawley and Syder, a native 
speaker has a number of fully- or semi-lexicalized 
morpheme sequences in her long-term memory, in 
addition to a set of productive syntactic rules. When 
people engage in a conversation, there are a num- 
ber of cognitively intensive tasks that they have to 
perform other than encording and decoding inter- 
nal structure of each utterance, such as planning a 
larger unit of discourse, planning and interpreting 
perlocutionary effects, and paying attention to the 
surroundings. The use of pre-established xpressions 
helps both the speaker and the addressee, since such 
expressions can be easily and quickly retrieved from 
their long-term emory, and little encoding and de- 
coding work is required. As Pawley and Syder note, 
these memorized sequences have varying degrees of 
lexicalization. While some are completely fixed ex- 
pressions, most others are "stems" that can be in- 
flected, expanded or transformed to some extent. 
7.2 Analogical Translation 
This model of a native speaker's linguistic compe- 
tence fits very well with the analogical framework 
of translation (Nagao, 1984), (Jones, 1996). In 
the analogical framework, thetranslation system is 
equipped with a large database of pre-translated x- 
ample pairs, in which the best example that matches 
the input expression is selected and used for gen- 
erating an appropriate target language xpression. 
For translating spoken language, an analogical sys- 
tem should have various entence stems and patterns 
along with their corresponding translation i  its ex- 
ample database. In this framework, the task of an 
the spoken language translation system can be seen 
as follows: given the speech recognizer output, the 
system must recover the closest example available in 
the example database (Figure 3). 
7.3 A Mode l  of Speech Production 
There are a number of factors that need to be consid- 
ered in trying to select the most appropriate example 
in the database for the given input. Based on four 
distinct factors that we have identified, we propose 
a model of spoken language production that we call 
the "cascaded noisy channel model" (Figure 4). In 
this model, the speaker first selects an example E 
that is closest to the core of the message that she 
intends to express. Then, the speaker modifies pat- 
terns by replacing subconstituents, by expanding it 
with modifiers, and by transforming it into different 
syntactic constructions (for example, transforming 
it from the declarative mood 4to the interrogative 
mood, or from the active voice to the passive voice). 
This process yields the "intended propositional con- 
tent"~ Next, depending on the speech situation and 
discourse context, the speaker applies certain prag- 
matic utterance strategies. This results in the "in- 
tended utterance", which is characterized by natural 
speech properties such as ellipsis, inverted word or- 
der, or interjections. 
When the speaker actually vocalizes the utter- 
ance, speech performance errors may occur. The re- 
sult of this is the "actual utterance" that is presented 
to the listener. The speech recognition program con- 
verts the speech signal to a string of word hypothe- 
ses, possibly introducing additional errors and dis- 
tortions, which results in the "recognizer output". 
20 
Closest :Exampie i::. ::: ': 
Figure 4: Cascaded Noisy Channel Model of Spoken 
Language 
Thus, the speech recognizer output, which repre- 
sents the input to the translation engine, has tra- 
versed four distinct channels or distortion processes, 
each of which is associated with different causes and 
effects on the message. Previous research has shown 
that speech recognizer errors can bc modeled, and 
corrected, in such a framework (Ringger and Allen, 
1996). In our work, we extend this model to cover a 
sequence of separate sources of distortions. 
7.4 A Hybr id  Analogical Method  for 
Speech Translation 
We have incorporated into the analogical transla- 
tion method a shallow syntactic analysis module 
that identifies clause and phrase boundaries and that 
converts some variations into lexical and syntactic 
features. Both input and example expressions are 
matched after shallow syntactic analysis. Analogi- 
cal matching and transfer is applied recursively to 
the input syntactic tree. By applying the recursivc 
analogical transfer process from larger linguistic con- 
stitucnts to subconstituents, the system can handle 
various degree of lexicalization in the input language 
in an efficient manner. 
In our work, the distortion processes are modeled 
using a number of distortion operators that operate 
on the shallow syntactic tree of the utterance. Given 
a number of independence assumptions, the most 
probable example can be computed efficiently with 
a dynamic programming algorithm. (See (Horiguchi 
and Franz, 1997) for more details.) 
8 An  Example 
This section shows an example of the manner in 
which an expression containing a pragmatic "polite- 
ness" component is translated from Japanese to En- 
glish. 
8.1 Japanese Input 
In the following example, speaker A is explaining an 
incident in which she was asked a difficult favor, and 
speaker B is responding, expressing her understand- 
ing of A's difficult position. 
(1)A: sorede tyotto kangaesasete 
so a-little think-CAUSE-PASS 
''so I said 'let me think for a while''' 
(2)B: 
hosii-tte itta no 
,ant-QUOTE say-PAST PART 
nanka muzukasii-yo-ne souiu no 
HEDGE be-difficult-PART-PART such thing 
kotowaru no-tte 
reject thing-TOP 
The propositional content of speaker B's response 
is "To reject something like that is difficult," but the 
utterance also contains a number of natural speech 
properties that add certain pragmatic elements of 
meaning. 
8.2 Pragmat ic  Operators 
The "intended propositional content" of the above 
utterancc's can be paraphrased as follows: 
(3) Souiu no-wo kotowaru no-ga muzukashii. 
such thing-0BJ reject thing-SBJ be-difficult 
Our flexible matching process is ~ble to map an 
inverted construction like example input (2) onto its 
normalized form (3). Then, the following pragmatic 
operators are found to have been applied to the "in- 
tended propositional content": 
a inserting nanka 
pragmatic strategy: soften the current assertion 
pragmatic effect: deference politeness ' 
? inserting-yo 
pragmatic strategy: express the attitude that 
the speaker's assertion is non-challcngcable 
pragmatic effect: solidarity politeness 
? inserting-he 
pragmatic strategy: indicate affective common 
ground 
pragmatic effect: solidarity politeness 
? deleting object marker -wo 
pragmatic strategy: emphasize shared knowl- 
edge 
pragmatic effect: solidarity politeness 
? subject-predicate inversion 
pragmatic strategy: point to previously estab- 
lished or implied referent 
pragmatic effect: discourse coherence, solidar- 
ity politeness 
21 
The last operator, subject-predicate inversion, is 
usually employed to describe how the subsequent 
information connects to the previous discourse by 
preposing the constituent that is implicitly or explic- 
itly related to something in the previous discourse. 
In the example above, it is used to point to the sit- 
uation that A has been talking about as something 
already established or agreed upon to be difficult, 
and thus can be interpreted as a solidarity polite- 
ness operator which reinforces the common ground 
between the interlocutors. 
8.3 Translating the Utterance 
This subsection discusses why it is necessary to ana- 
lyze which pragmatic operators were applied to the 
input, and to generate the corresponding pragmatic 
operators in the output, in order to obtain stylisti- 
cally and pragmatically high-quality translations. 
8.4 Pure Analogical  Translat ion 
If we employ a pure example-based translation 
method, most of the pragmatic information cannot 
be reflected, since it is not feasible for the exam- 
ple database to contain all possible pragmatically 
marked permutations of the examples. Therefore, 
in the best case, the following literal translation of 
sentence (3) might be obtained: 
(4) To reject something like that is difficult. 
Since sentence (4) is pragmatically neutral, the 
pragmatic information from the original sentence 
has been lost. 
8.5 Direct Mapp|ng 
A direct one-to~one mapping of each pragmatic 
strategy operator to the target language is not pos- 
sible, since many of these operators are not directly 
translatable to other languages. For example, while 
many  languages have hedges similar to nanka, and 
many languages include means to invert subject and 
predicate, only few languages include dcletable case- 
markers such as zoo or sentential particles such as yo 
and ne. Thus, if we attempt a direct mapping of the 
pragmatic operators, we might obtain a translation 
similar to the following: 
(5) Sort of difficult, to reject something like 
that is 
This translation is quite awkward, and does not 
fully reflect the pragmatic meaning of the original 
sentence. 
8.6 Translating Pragmatic Strategies 
By analyzing each operator for its pragmatic ef- 
fect, we can obtain a translation that preserves the 
speaker's pragmatic intentions: 
Well, it's sort of difficult, isn't it, to reject 
something like that. 
In this translation, the deference politeness trategy 
is transferred to the hedge words well and sort of, 
the solidarity politeness strategies are transferred to 
the tag question isn't it, and the subject-predicate 
inversion is transferred into the extraposition con- 
struction. 
8.7 Conclus ions and Further  Work 
Our work is motivated by the goal of pragmatically 
high-quality translation of spoken utterances of the 
type that may be found in human-to-human spo- 
ken dialogues. In order to accurately render the full 
range of meaning conveyed by such utterances, it 
is not sufficient o limit attention to syntactic and 
semantic aspects of spoken expressions. 
Based on a number of independent motivations, 
we have adopted a hybrid analogical approach to 
the problem of translating spoken language. Briefly, 
our approach is motivated by the shortcomings that 
we perceive in other approaches, uch as syntactic or 
semantic-grammar based, interlingua-based, purely 
analogical, or purely statistical methods. For more 
detailed arguments, please refer to (Horiguchi and 
Franz, 1997). 
In this paper, we have described our view of spo- 
ken language pragmatics, and we have described how 
pragmatic information can be translated within the 
hybrid analogical approach. In future work, we will 
perform corpus analysis for additional pragmatic op- 
erators, and extend the prototype implementation 
of our analogical speech translation system to cover 
these phenomena.
