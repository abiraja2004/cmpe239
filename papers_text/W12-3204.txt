Abstract
Studies of gender balance in academic com-
puter science are typically based on statistics
on enrollment and graduation. Going beyond
these coarse measures of gender participation,
we conduct a fine-grained study of gender
in the field of Natural Language Processing.
We use topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation) to explore the research topics of men
and women in the ACL Anthology Network.
We find that women publish more on dialog,
discourse, and sentiment, while men publish
more than women in parsing, formal seman-
tics, and finite state models. To conduct our
study we labeled the gender of authors in the
ACL Anthology mostly manually, creating a
useful resource for other gender studies. Fi-
nally, our study of historical patterns in fe-
male participation shows that the proportion
of women authors in computational linguis-
tics has been continuously increasing, with
approximately a 50% increase in the three
decades since 1980.
1 Introduction
The gender imbalance in science and engineering is
particularly striking in computer science, where the
percentage of graduate students in computer science
that are women seems to have been declining rather
than increasing recently (Palma, 2001; Beaubouef
and Zhang, 2011; Spertus, 1991; Hill et al, 2010;
Singh et al, 2007).
While many studies have examined enrollment
and career advancement, less attention has been
paid to gender differences in scientific publications.
This paper studies author gender in the Associa-
tion for Computational Linguistics Anthology Net-
work (AAN) corpus (Radev et al, 2009), (based on
the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al,
2008)) from which we used 13,000 papers by ap-
proximately 12,000 distinct authors from 1965 to
2008.
The AAN corpus disambiguates author names,
but does not annotate these names for gender. We
first performed a mostly-manual annotation of the
gender of each author (details in Section 2). We
make these annotation available as a useful resource
for other researchers.1
We then study a number of properties of the ACL
authors. We first address surface level questions re-
garding the balance of genders in publications. In
2008, women were granted 20.5% of computer sci-
ence PhDs (CRA, 2008). Does this ratio hold also
for the percentages of papers written by women in
computational linguistics as well? We explore dif-
ferences in publication count between genders, look-
ing at total publications and normalized values like
publications per year and trends over time.
Going beyond surface level analysis, we then turn
to document content. We utilize Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA) topic models (Blei et al, 2003) to
study the difference in topics that men and women
write about.
2 Determining Gender
The gender of an author is in general difficult to
determine automatically with extremely high pre-
cision. In many languages, there are gender-
differentiated names for men and women that can
make gender-assignment possible based on gen-
1http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/
gender.shtml
33
dered name dictionaries. But the fact that ACL
authors come from many different language back-
ground makes this method prone to error. For exam-
ple, while U.S. Census lists of frequently occurring
names by gender (Census, 2012) can resolve a large
proportion of commonly occurring names from au-
thors in the United States and Canada, they incor-
rectly list the name ?Jan? as female. It turns out
that authors in the ACL Anthology who are named
?Jan? are in fact male, since the name is a very com-
mon male name in many parts of Europe, and since
US female researchers named ?Jan? often use the
full form of their name rather than the shortening
?Jan? when publishing. Furthermore, a significant
percentage of ACL authors have Chinese language
names, which are much less clearly linked with per-
sonal names (e.g., Weiwei Sun is female whereas
Weiwei Ding is male).
We found that Chinese names as well as ambigu-
ous names like ?Jan? were poorly predicted by on-
line name gender website algorithms we looked at,
leading to a high error rate. To insure high precision,
we therefore instead chose to annotate the authors
in the corpus with a high-precision method; mainly
hand labeling the names but also using some auto-
matic help.
We used unambiguous name lists for various lan-
guages to label a large proportion of the name; for
example we used the subset of given names (out
of the 4221 first names reported in the 1990 U.S.
Census) that were unambiguous (occurring consis-
tently with only one gender in all of our name lists)
used morphological gender for languages like Czech
or Bulgarian which mark morphological gender on
names, and relied on lists of Indian and Basque
names (from which we had removed any ambigu-
ous names). For all ambiguous names, we next used
our personal cognizance of many of the ACL au-
thors, also asking for help from ACL researchers
in China, Taiwan, and Singapore (to help label Chi-
nese names of researchers they were familiar with)
and other researchers for help on the Japanese and
Korean names. Around 1100 names were hand-
labeled from personal cognizance or photos of the
ACL researchers on their web pages. The combina-
tion of name lists and personal cognizance left only
2048 names (15% of the original 12,692) still unla-
beled. We then used a baby name website, www.

3 Overall Statistics
We first discuss some overall gender statistics for the
ACL Anthology. Figure 1 shows the number of au-
thors of each gender. Men comprised 8573 of the
12692 authors (67.5%) and there were 3359 female
authors (26.5%). We could not confidently deter-
mine the gender of 761 out of 12692 (6.0%) of the
authors. Some of these are due to single letter first
names or problems with ill-formatted data.
Table 1 lists the number of papers for each gen-
der. About twice as many papers had at least one

determined names was 34% female, 66% male, slightly

34
male author (64%) as had at least one female au-
thor (33%). The statistics for first authorship were
slightly more skewed; women were the first author
of 27% of papers, whereas men first authored 71%.
In papers with at least one female author, the first au-
thor was a woman 60% of the time, whereas papers
with at least one male author had a male first author
80% of the time. Thus men not only write more pa-
pers, but are also more frequently first authors.

Figure 2: The number of authors of a given gender for a
given year.
Figure 2 shows gender statistics over time, giving
the number of authors of a given gender for a given
year. An author is considered active for a year if he
or she was an author of at least one paper. The num-
ber of both men and women authors increases over
the years, reflecting the growth of computational lin-
guistics.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of authors of a
given gender over time. We overlay a linear re-
gression of authorship percentage for each gender
showing that the proportion of women is growing
over time. The male best fit line has equation y =
?0.3025x + 675.49(R2 = 0.41, p = 1.95 ? 10?5)
and the female best fit line is y = 0.3429x ?
659.48(R2 = 0.51, p = 1.48?10?5). Female author-
ship percentage grew from 13% in 1980 to 27% in
2007, while male authorship percentage decreased
from 79% in 1980 to 71% in 2007. Using the best
fit lines as a more robust estimate, female authorship
grew from 19.4% to 29.1%, a 50% relative increase.
This increase of the percentage of women author-
ship is substantial. Comparable numbers do not
seem to exist for computer science in general, but
according to the CRA Taulbee Surveys of computer
science (CRA, 2008), women were awarded 18% of
the PhDs in 2002 and 20.5% in 2007. In computa-
tional linguistics in the AAN, women first-authored
26% of papers in 2002 and 27% of papers in 2007.
Although of course these numbers are not directly
comparable, they at least suggest that women partic-
ipate in computational linguistics research at least as
much as in the general computer science population
and quite possibly significantly more.
We next turn attention to how the most prolific
authors of each gender compare. Figure 4 shows the
number of papers published by the top 400 authors
of each gender, sorted in decreasing order. We see
that the most prolific authors are men.
There is an important confound in interpreting the
number of total papers by men and the statistics on
prolific authors. Since, as Figure 3 shows, there was
a smaller proportion of women in the field in the
early days of computational linguistics, and since
authors publish more papers the longer they are in
the field, it?s important to control for length of ser-
vice.
Figure 5 shows the average number of active years
for each gender. An author is considered active in
the years between his or her first and last publication
in the anthology. Comparing the number of years
of service for each gender, we find that on average
men indeed have been in the field longer (t-test, p =
10?6).
Accounting for this fact, Figure 6 shows the aver-
age number of publications per active year. Women
published an average of 1.07 papers per year active,
while men published 1.03 papers per active year.
This difference is significant (t-test, p = 10?3), sug-
gesting that women are in fact slightly more prolific
than men per active year.
In the field of Ecology, Sih and Nishikawa (1988)
found that men and women published roughly the
same number of papers per year of service. They
used a random sample of 100 researchers in the field.
In contrast, Symonds et al (2006) found that men
published more papers per year than women in ecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology. This study also used
random sampling, so it is unclear if the differing re-
sults are caused by a sampling error or by some other
source.

4 Topic Models
In this section we discuss the relationship between
gender and document content. Our main tool is La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a model of the top-
ics in a document. We briefly describe LDA; see
(Blei et al, 2003) for more details. LDA is a genera-
tive model of documents, which models documents
as a multinomial mixture of topics, which in turn are

multinomial distributions over words. The genera-
tive story proceeds as follows: a document first picks
the number of words N it will contain and samples a
multinomial topic distribution p(z|d) from a Dirich-
let prior. Then for each word to be generated, it picks
a topic z for that word, and then a word from the
multinomial distribution p(w|z).
Following earlier work like Hall et al (2008), we
ran LDA (Blei et al, 2003) on the ACL Anthology,

producing 100 generative topics. The second author
and another senior expert in the field (Christopher D.
Manning) collaboratively assigned labels to each of
the 100 topics including marking those topics which
were non-substantive (lists of function words or af-
fixes) to be eliminated. Their consensus labeling
eliminated 27 topics, leaving 73 substantive topics.
In this study we are interested in how documents
written by men and women differ. We are mainly in-
terested in Pr(Z|G), the probability of a topic being
written about by a given gender, and Pr(Z|Y,G),
the probability of a topic being written about by a
particular gender in a given year. Random variable
Z ranges over topics, Y over years, and G over gen-
der. Our topic model gives us Pr(z|d), where d is a
particular document. For a document d ? D, let dG
be the gender of the first author, and dY the year it
was written.
To compute Pr(z|g), we sum over documents
whose first author is gender g:
Pr(z|g) =
?
{d?D|dG=g}
Pr(z|d) Pr(d|g)
=
?
{d?D|dG=g}
Pr(z|d)
|{d ? D|dG = g}|
To compute Pr(z|y, g), we additionally condition
on the year a document was written:
Pr(z|y, g) =
?
{d?D|dY =y}
Pr(z|d) Pr(d|y, g)
=
?
{d?D|dY =y,dG=g}
Pr(z|d)
|{d ? D|dY = y, dG = g}|
To determine fields in which one gender publishes
more than another, we compute the odds-ratio
Pr(z|g = female)(1? Pr(z|g = female))
Pr(z|g = male)(1? Pr(z|g = male))
for each of the 73 topics in our corpus.
5 Topic Modeling Results
Using the odds-ratio defined above, we computed
the top eight male and female topics. The top
female-published topics are speech acts + BDI,
prosody, sentiment, dialog, verb subcategorization,
summarization, anaphora resolution, and tutoring
systems. Figure 9 shows the top words for each of
those topics. Figure 7 shows how they have evolved
over time.
The top male-published topics are categorial
grammar + logic, dependency parsing, algorithmic
efficiency, parsing, discriminative sequence models,
unification based grammars, probability theory, and
formal semantics. Figure 8 and 10 display these top-
ics over time and their associated words.
There are interesting possible generalizations in
these topic differences. At least in the ACL cor-
pus, women tend to publish more in speech, in social
and conversational topics, and in lexical semantics.
Men tend to publish more in formal mathematical
approaches and in formal syntax and semantics.
Of course the fact that a certain topic is more
linked with one gender doesn?t mean the other gen-
der does not publish in this topic. In particular, due
to the larger number of men in the field, there can be
numerically more male-authored papers in a female-
published topic. Instead, what our analysis yields
are topics that each gender writes more about, when
adjusted by the number of papers published by that
gender in total.
Nonetheless, these differences do suggest that
women and men in the ACL corpus may, at least
to some extent, exhibit some gender-specific tenden-
cies to favor different areas of research.

6 Conclusion
Our study of gender in the ACL Anthology shows
important gains in the percentage of women in the
field over the history of the ACL (or at least the last
30 years of it). More concretely, we find approxi-
mately a 50% increase in the proportion of female
authors since 1980. While women?s smaller num-
bers means that they have produced less total pa-
pers in the anthology, they have equal (or even very
slightly higher) productivity of papers per year.
In topics, we do notice some differing tenden-
cies toward particular research topics. In current
work, we are examining whether these differences
are shrinking over time, as a visual overview of Fig-
ure 7 seems to suggest, which might indicate that
gender balance in topics is a possible outcome, or
possibly that topics first addressed by women are
likely to to be taken up by male researchers. Ad-
ditionally, other applications of topic models to the
ACL Anthology allow us to study the topics a sin-
gle author publishes in over time (Anderson et al,
2012). These techniques would allow us to study
how gender relates to an author?s topics throughout
his or her career.
Our gender labels for ACL authors (available
at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/
gender.shtml) provide an important resource
for other researchers to expand on the social study
of computational linguistics research.
