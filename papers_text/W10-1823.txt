Abstract 
We propose a feature type classification 
thought to be used in a therapeutic context. 
Such a scenario lays behind our need for a 
easily usable and cognitively plausible classi-
fication. Nevertheless, our proposal has both 
a practical and a theoretical outcome, and its 
applications range from computational lin-
guistics to psycholinguistics. An evaluation 
through inter-coder agreement has been per-
formed to highlight the strength of our pro-
posal and to conceive some improvements for 
the future. 
1 Introduction 
Most common therapeutic practices for anomia 
rehabilitation rely either on the therapist?s intui-
tive linguistic knowledge or on different kinds of 
resources that have to be consulted manually 
(Semenza, 1999; Raymer and Gonzalez-Rothi, 
2002; Springer, 2008). STaRS.sys (Semantic 
Task Rehabilitation Support system) is a tool 
thought for supporting the therapist in the prepa-
ration of a semantic task (cfr. Nickels, 2002).  
To be effective, such a system must lean on a 
knowledge base in which every concept is asso-
ciated with different kinds of featural descrip-
tions. The notion of feature refers to the linguis-
tic descriptions of a property that can be obtained 
by asking a subject to describe a concept. Exam-
ples of concept-feature pairings will be repre-
sented here as <concept> feature 1  couples 
such as <dog> has a tail or <dog> barks.

 Typographical conventions: concepts, categories and fea-
tures will be printed in italics courier new font. 
When reporting a concept-feature pair, the concept will be 
further enclosed by <angled brackets>. Feature types 
and classes of types will be both reported in times roman, 
but while the formers will be written in italics, type classes 
will be in SMALL CAPITALS. 
As a consequence of this scenario, an intuitive 
and cognitively plausible classification of the 
feature types that can be associated with a con-
cept is a vital component of our tool. In this pa-
per, we present a classification that meets such 
criteria, built by moving from an analysis of the 
relevant proposals available in the literature.  
We evaluated our classification by asking to a 
group of naive Italian speakers to annotate a test 
set by using our categories. The resulting agree-
ment has been interpreted both as an index of 
reliability and as a measure of ease of learning 
and use by non-expert speakers. In these prelimi-
nary phases we focus on Italian, leaving to future 
evaluations whether or how to extend the domain 
of our tool to other languages. 
These pages are organized as follows: in Sec-
tion 2 we briefly review the relevant works for 
the following discussion. In Section 3 we intro-
duce our classification and in the remaining part 
we evaluate its reliability and usability. 
2 Related Works 
2.1 Feature Norms 
In the psychological tradition, a collection of fea-
ture norms is typically built by asking to a group 
of speakers to generate short phrases (i.e. fea-
tures) to describe a given set of concepts.  
Even if normative data have been collected 
and employed for addressing a wide range of 
issues on the nature of the semantic memory, the 
only freely available resources are, to our know-
ledge, those by Garrard et al(2001), those by 
McRae et al(2005), those by Vinson and Vig-
liocco (2008), all in English, and the Dutch 
norms available in the Leuven database (De 
Deyne et al 2008). 
Moving out of the psychological domain, the 
only collection built in the lexicographic tradi-
tion is that by Kremer et al(2008), collected 
from Italian and German speakers

2.2 Related Classifications 
The proposals that constitute our theoretical 
framework have been chosen for their being ei-
ther implemented in an extensive semantic re-
source, motivated by well specified theoretical 
explanations (on which there is consensus) or 
effectively used in a specific therapeutic context. 
They have originated in research fields as distant 
as lexicography, theoretical linguistics, ontology 
building, (clinical) neuropsychology and cogni-
tive psychology. Specifically, the works we 
moved from have been: 
? a type classification adopted for clinical pur-
poses in the CIMeC?s Center for Neurocogni-
tive Rehabilitation (personal communication); 
? the knowledge-type taxonomy proposed by 
Wu & Barsalou (2009), and the modified ver-
sion adopted by Cree & McRae (2003); 
? the brain region taxonomy proposed by Cree 
& McRae (2003); 
? the semantic (but not lexical) relations imple-
mented in WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998) and 
in EuroWordNet (Alonge et al 1998); 
? the classification of part/whole relations by 
Winston et al(1987); 
? the SIMPLE-PAROLE-CLIPS Extended Qua-
lia Structures (Ruimy et al 2002). 
3 STaRS.sys feature types classification 
The properties of our classification follow from 
the practical use scenario of STaRS.sys. In de-
tails, the fact that it?s thought to be used in a the-
rapeutic context motivates our need for a classi-
fication that has to be: (1) intuitive enough to be 
easily used by therapist and (2) robust and (3) 
cognitively plausible so as to be used for prepar-
ing the relevant kinds of therapeutic tasks.  
Furthermore, being focused on features pro-
duced by human speakers, the classification ap-
plies to the linguistic description of a property, 
rather than to the property itself. Accordingly, 
then, pairings like the following: 
<plane> carries stuff 
<plane> is used for carrying stuff 
are though as instances of different types (re-
spectively, is involved in and is used for).  
Starting from an analysis of the relevant pro-
posals available in the literature, we identified a 
set of 26 feature types, most of which have been 
organized into the following six classes: 
TAXONOMIC PROPERTIES: Two types related 
to the belonging of a concept to a category have 
been isolated: the is-a and the coordinate types. 
PART-OF RELATIONS: We mainly followed 
Winston et als (1987) taxonomy in distinguish-
ing six types describing a relation between a 
concept and its part(s): has component, has 
member, has portion, made-of, has phase and 
has geographical part. 
PERCEPTUAL PROPERTIES: Inspired by the 
Cree and McRae?s (2003) brain region taxono-
my, we isolated six types of perceivable proper-
ties: has size, has shape, has texture, has taste, 
has smell, has sound, has colour. 
USAGE PROPERTIES: This class is composed 
by three types of an object?s use descriptions: is 
used for, is used by and is used with. 
LOCATIONAL PROPERTIES: We identified 
three types describing the typical situation, space 
and time associated to an object. 
ASSOCIATED EVENTS AND ATTRIBUTES: This 
class encompasses three kinds of information 
that can be associated to an object: its emotive 
property (has affective property), one of its per-
manent properties (has attribute) and the role it 
plays in an action or in a process (is involved in). 
As a matter of fact, each of the other classes is a 
specification of one of the two latter types, to 
which particular relevance has been accorded 
due to their status from a cognitive point of view.  
Others: Two feature types fall out of this 
classification, and constitute two distinct classes 
on their own. These are the has domain type, that 
specifies the semantic field of a concept, and the 
dummy is associated with, used for classifying 
all those features that falls out of any other label. 
Comparison and final remarks: A quick 
comparison between our types and the other 
classifications reveals that, apart from the is used 
with type, we didn?t introduce any new opposi-
tion. Any type of ours, indeed, has a parallel type 
or relation in at least one of the other proposals. 
Such a remark shows what is the third major ad-
vantage of our classification, together with its 
usability and its cognitive plausibility: its compa-
tibility with a wide range of well known theoreti-
cal and experimental frameworks, that allows it 
to serve as a common ground for the interplay of 
theories, insights and ideas originated from the 
above mentioned research areas. 
4 Evaluation 
Given the aims of our classification, and of 
STaRS.sys in general, we choose to evaluate our 
coding scheme by asking to a group of non ex-
perts to label a subset of the non-normalized 
Kremer et als (2008) norms and measuring the 
158
inter-coder agreement between them (Artstein 
and Poesio, 2008), adhering to the Krippen-
dorff?s (2004, 2008) recommendations.  
The choice to recruit only naive subjects has 
the positive consequence of allowing us to draw 
inferences also on the usability of our proposal. 
That is, such an evaluation can be additionally 
seen as a measure of how easily a minimally 
trained user can understand the oppositions iso-
lated in our classification. 
4.1 Experimental Setup 
Participants: 5 Italian speakers with a university 
degree were recruited for this evaluation. None 
of them had any previous experience in lexico-
graphy, nor any education in lexical semantics. 
Materials: 300 concept-feature pairs were se-
lected mainly from a non-normalized version of 
the Kremer et als (2008) norms. We choose this 
dataset because (1) it?s a collection of descrip-
tions generated by Italian speakers and (2) we 
wanted to avoid any bias due to a normalization 
procedure, so as to provide our subjects with de-
scriptions that were as plausible as possible. 
The experimental concept-attribute pairs have 
been chosen so to have the more balanced distri-
bution of concepts and feature types as possible, 
by not allowing duplicated pairs. As for the con-
cepts, an uniform distribution of features per cat-
egory (30 feature for all the ten categories of the 
original dataset) and of features per concept (i.e. 
between 4 and 7) has been easily obtained.  
The attempt to balance feature types, however, 
has revealed impracticable, mainly due to the 
nature of the concepts of the Kremer?s collection 
and to the skewness of its type distribution. 
Therefore, we fixed an arbitrary minimum thre-
shold of ten plausible features per type. Plausible 
features have been obtained from a pilot annota-
tion experiment performed by one author and an 
additional subject. We further translated 23 con-
cept-feature pairs from the McRae (11 cases) and 
from the Leuven (12 cases) datasets for balanc-
ing types as much as possible. 
Still, it has not been possible to find ten fea-
tures for the following types: has Geographical 
Part, has Phase and has Member (no features at 
all: this is a consequence of the kind of concept 
represented the dataset), has Portion (only four 
cases, again, this is a consequence of the source 
dataset), has Domain (5) and has Sound (6). We 
nevertheless decided to include these types in the 
instructions and the relevant features in the test 
set. Our decision has been motivated by the re-
sults of the pilot experiment, in which the sub-
jects made reference to such types as a secondary 
interpretation in more than ten cases. 
Procedure: The participants were asked to la-
bel every concept-feature pair with the appropri-
ate type label, relying primarily on the linguistic 
form of the feature. They received a 17-pages 
booklet providing an explanation of the annota-
tion goals, a definition and some examples for 
every type class and for every type, a decision 
flowchart and a reference table.  
Every participant was asked to read carefully 
the instructions, to complete a training set of 30 
concept-feature pairs and to discuss his/her deci-
sions with one of the two authors before starting 
the experimental session. The test set was pre-
sented as a unique excel sheet. On the average, 
labeling the 300 experimental pairs took 2 hours.  
4.2 Results 
The annotations collected from the participants 
have been normalized by conflating direct (e.g. 
is-a) and reverse (e.g. is the Category of) relation 
labels, and the agreement between their choice 
has been measured adopting Fleiss? Kappa. The 
?Kappa: annotators? column of Table 1 reports 
the general and the type-wise kappa scores2 for 
the annotations of the participants.

Even if there is no consensus on how to interp-
ret Kappa values in isolation, and despite the fact 
that, to our knowledge, this is the first work of 
this kind, we can nevertheless draw interesting 
conclusions from the pattern in table 1. The gen-
eral Kappa score has a value of 0.73, and the 
agreement values are above 0.8 for 12 types, not 
so distant in 2 cases, and well above 0.67 for 9 
types, 5 of which are our ?residual? categories, 
that is, those that are more ?general? that at least 
one of the other types3. 
Such a contrast between the residual and the 
other types is even more pronounced in the class-
wise analysis, where the only Kappa value below 
the 0.8 threshold is the one obtained for the AS-
SOCIATED EVENTS AND ATTRIBUTES class (? = 
0.766) 4 . Furthermore, the distribution of false 
positives in a confusion matrix between the per-
formance of the annotators and the ?majority? 
vote5 shows that part of the low agreement for 
the residual types is due to the ?summation? of 
the disagreement on the other categories. Ob-
viously, part of this variance is due also to the 
fact that such types have fuzzier boundaries, and 
so are more difficult to handle. 
As for the remaining four low agreement 
types, two of them (has affective property, has 
domain) have been signaled by the annotators to 
be difficult to handle, while the remaining two 
(has sound, has portion) have been frequently 
confused with one of the ASSOCIATED EVENTS 
AND ATTRIBUTES types and with the has compo-
nent type, respectively. Such results are not very 
puzzling for the has domain and has portion 
types, given the technicality of the former and, 
for the latter, the nature of the described con-
cepts. They do point, however, to a better defini-
tion of the remaining two types, the has sound 
and has affective property ones, in that most dif-
ficulties seem to arise from an unclear definition 
of their respective scopes. 
As pointed out by Artstein and Poesio (2008), 
agreement doesn?t ensure validity. In trying to 
evaluate how our annotators ?did it right?, we 
measured the exact Kappa coefficient (Conger, 
1980) between the majority annotation (i.e. what 
annotators should have done to agree) and the 
annotation of the same set by one of the two au-

 Our residual labels are has Attribute, has Texture, is Asso-

parison is 0.766.

thors. With some approximation, we see this last 
performance as the ?right? one. 
Results are reported in the ?Kappa: gold / ma-
jority? column of Table 1. The general Kappa 
value is well above 0.8, and so it is for 15 of the 
23 types. Only two types (has domain and is as-
sociated with) are below the 0.67 minimal thre-
shold. These data further confirm the difficulties 
in handling residual types, but, more importantly, 
seem to suggest that our ?gold standard? annota-
tor have been able to learn the classification in a 
fairly correct way (at least, it did in a way similar 
as one of the two authors of this classification). 
4.3 Discussion 
We interpret the results of our evaluation as a 
demonstration of the reliability of our coding 
scheme as well as of the usability of our classifi-
cation, at least as the non residual types are con-
cerned. For the future, many improvements are 
suggested by our data. In particular, they showed 
the need of the annotators to receive a better 
training on some relations and distinctions.  
This points in the direction of both a more 
deep training on the types we?ve dubbed as ?re-
siduals?, and of a better definition of poorly un-
derstood types such as has domain and has affec-
tive property and puzzling distinctions such as 
the has smell/is Involved in ones. 
5 Conclusions and Future Directions 
In this paper we introduced a classification of the 
information types that can be expressed to de-
scribe a concrete concept. Even if we thought 
this classification mainly for therapeutic purpos-
es, its use can be broadened to include a wide 
range of possible NLP tasks.  
We evaluated our proposal by asking a group 
of naive speakers to annotate a list of concept-
feature pairs with the appropriate label. Even if 
our results can?t be interpreted as absolutely pos-
itive, we consider them promising, in that (1) the 
skeleton of the classification seems to have been 
validated by the performance of our participants 
and (2) a great part of the disagreement seems to 
be solvable through major care in the training 
phase. In the near future we are going to test our 
(improved) coding scheme with annotators from 
the population of the STaRS.sys final users, i.e. 
therapist with experience in semantic therapy. 
Finally, further research is needed to assess if 
and to what extent the semantic model underly-
ing our classification is compatible with those of 
existing lexical and/or semantic resources.
