Abstract  
We present a constraint-based case flame 
lexicon arctfitecture fbr bi-directionM 
mapping between a syntactic ase Dame 
and a semantic Dame. The lexicon uses 
a semantic sense as the basic unit and 
employs a multi-tiered constraint struc- 
ture for the resolution of syntactic in- 
formation into the appropriate senses 
and/or idiomatic usage. VMency chang- 
ing transfbrmations such as morptnolog- 
ieally marked passivized or causativized 
forms are handled via le:xical rules that 
manipulate case Dames templates. The 
system has been implemented in a typed- 
feature system and applied to Turkish. 
1 Int roduct ion  
-Recent adwmces in theoreticM and practical as- 
pects of feature and constraint-based tbrmMisms 
for representing linguistic information have fos- 
tered research on the use of such formMisms in 
the design and implementation of computational 
lexicons (Briscoe el al., 1993). Case frame ap- 
proach has been the representation of choice es- 
pecially for languages with free constituent order, 
explicit case marking of noun phrases and embed- 
ded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles. The 
semantics of such syntactic role fillers are usually 
determined by their lexicM, semantic and mor- 
plmsyntactic properties, instead of position in the 
sentence. In this paper, we present an approach 
to building a constraint-based case Dame lexicon 
for use in natural language processing in Turkish. 
A number of observations tha.t we have made on 
Turkish tmve indicated that we have to go beyond 
the traditional transitive and intransitive distinc- 
tion, and utilize a Damework where verb valence 
is considered as the obligatory co-existence of an 
arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with 
the obligatory exclusion of certain others, relative 
to a verb seuse. Addi t iona l  morphosynt~ct ic,  lex- 
ical and semantic selectional constrMnts are uti- 
lized to map a given syntactic argument structure 
to a specific verb sense. In recent years, there have 
been several studies on constrmnt-based lexicons. 
iR,ussell el al. (1993) propose an approach to mul- 
tiple default inheritance tbr unification-based lexi- 
con. In another study by Lascarides et el. (1995), 
an ordered approach to default unification is sug- 
gested, de Paiva (1993) tbrmalizes the system 
of well-fornmd typed feature struetures. In this 
study, type hierarchies and relations are mathe- 
matically defined. They also formalize unification 
and generalization operators between tin(; featm:e 
structures, along with defining well-formedness 
notion that we use in our system. 
2 Representing Case Frame 
I n fo rmat ion  
In rlhu'kish, (and possibly in many other lan- 
guages) verbs often convey several meanings 
(some totally unrelated) when they are used with 
subjects, objects, oblique objects, adverbiM ad- 
juncts, with certain lexical, morphological, and 
semantic features, and co occurrence restrictions. 
In addition to the usual sense wu:iations due to se- 
lectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in most 
cases, the meaning conveyed by a. case Dante is id- 
iomatic, with subtle constrMnts. For example, the 
Turkisln verb ye (cat), when used with a direct ob- 
ject noun phrase whose head is: 
1. para (money), with no case or possessive 
markings and a lmman subject, means to ac- 
cept bribe, 
2. pare (money), wittn a non-human subject, 
means to cost a lol, 
3. para (or any other NP whose head is onto- 
logically IS-A money, e.g., dolar, mark, etc.) 
with obligatory accusative markilig ~md op- 
tional possessive meriting, means to spend 
*~IO~tCy~ 
4. kafa (head) with obligatory accusative mark- 
ing and no possessive marking, means to get 
mentally deranged, 
5. hak (right) with optionM accusative and pos- 
sessive markings, mearls to be unfair, 
854 
6. I~(t.s( (head, of'. d) (or a.ny N\] ) whose het~(/ 
is ontologically IS-A hnma.n) with optional 
accusative mill optio,al  i)ossessivc marking 
(obligatory only with ba,~), lilea31s lo waste 
or demote, a person. 
On the other ha.rill: 
I. if' a.n ablative ease-marked oblique object de- 
uoting ;m edible entity ix present, then there 
should not be any direct el)jeer, a.,d tile verb 
,,w:m,s to eat a 1,ieec oJ" (the edible (oblique) 
oD\[\]eet)l or
2. if the abla.tive case-ll,au'ked oblique o|)ject 
does not denote something edible, but rather 
a. container, then the sense maps to to eat oul 
of, with the optio'naldirect (cdil)le) ol)ject de- 
noting the ol).iect eat(,,. 
Ctea.rly such 11sage ha.s impas:t on tln'Jnatic roh: ns-

ib~r to the structure proposed in Laser, rides cl al.

elude in the argument slot (for a verb in active 
voice) are the following: 
? subject (nominative NP), 1 
? direct object (nominative or accusative ase- 
marked ~IP), 
? oblique objects (ablative, dative, locative 
case-marked NP), 
? beneficiary object (dative case-marked ~lP, or 
pP with a certain PFORN), 
? instrument object (instrumental case-marked 
gP or PP with a certain PFORIt), 
? value object (dative case-marked NP or PP 
with a certain PFORH). 
In general, there may be more than one instan- 
tiation of the SEM frame for a given instantiated 
set of case frame arguments (and vice versa). For 
instance, for the ye verb discussed above, the ar- 
gument structure for the third case giving rise to 
the meaning to get mentally deranged may con- 
ceivably give rise to a literal meaning in a rather 
improbable context (such as eating the head of a 
fish at dinner - much in the spirit of the two inter- 
pretations of the English idiom kick the bucket), 
or the same semantics may be expressed by a dif- 
ferent surface form. 
3.2 Const ra int  Areh l teeture  
We express constraints on the arguments in the 
case frame of a verb via a 5-tier constraint hierar- 
chy sharing constraints among the specification of 
other constraints and sense definitions, whenever 
possible: 
NP's that have no case-marking in Turkish. 
1. Constraints on verb features that describe 
any relevant constraints on tile morphologi- 
cal features of the verb, such as agreement or 
voice markers. 
2. Constraints on mou)hological features that 
describe any obligatory constraints on the ar- 
guments, such as case-marking, verb form (in 
the case of embedded clauses), etc. 
3. Constraints on argument co-occurrence that 
express obligatory argument co-occurrence 
constraints along with constraints that indi- 
cate when certain arguments should not occur 
in order resolve a sense. 
4. Lexieal constraints that indicate any specific 
constraints on the heads of the arguments in 
order to convey a certain sense, and usually 
constrain the stem of the head noun to be a 
certain lexical form, or one of a small set 'of  
lexical forms. 
5. Semantic Constraints that indicate seman- 
tic selectional restriction constraints that 
may resolved using a companion ontologi- 
cal database (again implemented in TFS) in 
which we model the world by defining se- 
mantic categories, uch as human, thing, non- 
living object, living object, etc., along the lines 
described by Nagao et al (1985). 
Figure 2 illustrates the simplified form of the 
constraint-sense mapping of the verb yc (eal). 
a.a Va leney  Chang ing  Transtbrmat ions  
As we have already stated, we encode senses of 
verbs in active voice unless a verb has an idiomatic 
usage with obligatory passive, causative and/or 
856 
reflexive voices. 2 In order to handle these valency 
changing transfor-mations, we dellne lexical rules 
as shown in Figure 3.

This ligure describes how a given case fi'ame 
with its syntactic constituents is processed by a 
sequence of lexical rules each stripping off a cer- 
tain voice marker and then attempting unification 
wii;h t;he lexicon for any possible sense resohttion. 
The order of lexieal rules in this figure reflects the 
reverse order of voice markers in 'Purkish verbal 
morphology, a So a given case frame m~y have 
to go through three lexical rules until it finds a 
unifying entry in the lexicon. \[h|itications be- 
fore going through all le?ical rule.s are for (possi- 
My idiomatic)senses which explicitly require w~r- 
ious voice \]na,rkings. Two additional constituents 
are a,dded via these lexieal rules. 'l'he AGI't-13B3

In inost eases, there are arguments that are not 
obligatorily required for resolving a verb sense. 
These, nevertheless, have to be constrained, usu- 
ally on semantic grounds. For instance the di- 
rect object is not obligatory for the basic sense of 
ye, but has to be an edible entity if it, is present. 
We handle these constraints by defining a slightly 
more complex type hierarchy: 
argument = noun-phrase I 
case - f rame I 
optional. 
optional = optional-edible I 
opt ional-cont ainer I 
optional- instrument . . . .  
optional-edible = nil I edible-obj. 
edible-obj ~ noun-phrase & IS-A-EDIBLE. 
where  IS -A -EDIBLE  i s  a const ra in t  o f  the  t'orrrt 
\[IIEAD: I SEM: edible\]. The optional ablative and in- 
strumental objects are defined similarly. 4 The 
4Note th~Lt the surface case constraints for these 
are defined in the ha,sic definition of the case fl:ame.

sense definition then becomes: 
SENSE-EAT1 := 
VERB-IS-YE & VERB-TAKES-NO-REFLEXIVE g 
NO-DATIVE-OBL-OB J 
DIR-0B J-IS (optional-edible) 
ABL-0BL-0BJ (optional-container) 
INST-OBJ-IS(optional-instrument) g SEN-EAT1. 
As a more cornplicated exaInl)le mploying nested 
clauses, we presenl, below the case frame for the 
last example in Secl, ion 2, where the verb rut 
(catch) is used with a clausal subjecl; for a very
