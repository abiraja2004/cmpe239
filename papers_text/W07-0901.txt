Abstract 
This paper provides a description and 
evaluation of a generic named-entity rec-
ognition (NER) system for Swedish applied 
to electronic versions of Swedish literary 
classics from the 19th century. We discuss 
the challenges posed by these texts and the 
necessary adaptations introduced into the 
NER system in order to achieve accurate 
results, useful both for metadata genera-
tion, but also for the enhancement of the 
searching and browsing capabilities of Lit-
teraturbanken, the Swedish Literature 
Bank, an ongoing cultural heritage project 
which aims to digitize significant works of 
Swedish literature. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper we investigate generic named entity 
recognition (NER) technology and the necessary 
adaptation required in order to automatically anno-
tate electronic versions of a number of Swedish 
literary works of fiction from the 19th century. 
Both the genre and language variety are markedly 
different from the text types that our NER system 
was originally developed to annotate. This presents 
a challenge, posing both specific and more generic 
problems that need to be dealt with. 
In section 2 we present briefly the background 
and motivation for the present work, and section 3 
gives some information on related work. In section 
4 we provide a description of the named entity rec-
ognition system used in this work, its entity taxon-
omy, including the animacy recognition compo-
nent and the labeled consistency approach that is 
explored. Problems faced in the literary texts and 
the kinds of adaptations performed in the recogni-
tion system as well as evaluation and error analysis 
are given in section 5. Finally, section 6 summa-
rizes the work and provides some thoughts for fu-
ture work. 
2 Background 
Litteraturbanken <http://litteraturbanken.se/> (the 
Swedish Literature Bank) is a cultural heritage pro-
ject financed by the Swedish Academy1. Littera-
turbanken has as its aim to make available online 
the full text of significant works of Swedish litera-
ture, old and new, in critical editions suitable for 
literary research and for the teaching of literature. 
There is also abundant ancillary material on the 
website, such as author presentations, bibliogra-
phies, thematic essays about authorships, genres or 
periods, written by experts in each field.  
Similarly to many other literature digitization 
initiatives, most of the works in Litteraturbanken 
are such for which copyright has expired (i.e., at 
least 70 years have passed since the death of the 
author); at present the bulk of the texts are from the 
18th, 19th and early 20th century. However, there 
is also an agreement with the organizations repre-
senting authors? intellectual property rights, allow-
ing the inclusion of modern works according to a 
uniform royalty payment scheme. At present, Lit-
teraturbanken holds about 150 works ? mainly 
novels ? by about 50 different authors. The text 
collection is slated to grow by 80?100 novel-length 
works (appr. 4?6 million words) annually. 
                                                 
1 The present permanent version of Litteraturbanken was pre-
ceded by a two-year pilot project by the same name, funded by 
the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. 
1
Even at outset of the Litteraturbanken project, it 
was decided to design the technical solutions with 
language technology in mind. The rationale for this 
was that we saw these literary texts not only as rep-
resenting Sweden?s literary heritage, but also as 
high-grade empirical data for linguistic investiga-
tions, i.e. as corpus components. Hence, we wanted 
to build an infrastructure for Litteraturbanken 
which would allow this intended dual purpose of 
the material to be realized to the fullest.2 However, 
we soon started to think about how the kinds of 
annotations that language technology could pro-
vide could be of use to others than linguists, e.g. 
literary scholars, historians and researchers in other 
fields in the humanities and social sciences.  
Here, we will focus on one of these annotation 
types, namely NER and entity annotation. Com-
bined with suitable interfaces for displaying, 
searching, selecting, correlating and browsing 
named entities, we believe that the recognition and 
annotation of named entities in Litteraturbanken 
will facilitate more advanced research on literature 
(particularly in the field of literary onomastics; see 
Dalen-Oskam and Zundert, 2004), but also, e.g., 
historians could find this facility useful, insofar as 
these fictional narratives also contain, e.g. descrip-
tions of real locations, characterizations of real 
contemporary public figures, etc. Flanders et al 
(1998: 285) argue that references to people in his-
torical sources are of intrinsic interest since they 
may reveal ?networks of friendship, enmity, and 
collaboration; familial relationships; and political 
alliances [?] class position, intellectual affilia-
tions, and literary bent of the author?. 
3 Related Work 
The presented work is naturally related to research 
on NER, particularly as applied to dia-
chronic/historical corpora. The technology itself 
has been applied to various domains and genres 
over the last couple of decades such as financial 
news and biomedicine, with performance rates dif-
ficult to compare since the task is usually tied to 
particular domains/genres and applications. For a 
concise overview of the technology see Borthwick, 
                                                 
                                                
2 This precluded the use of ready-made digital library or CMS 
solutions, as we wanted to be compatible with emerging stan-
dards for language resources and tools, e.g. TEI/(X)CES and 
ISO TC37/SC07, which to our knowledge has never been a 
consideration in the design of digital library or CM systems. 
(1999). Even though this technology is widely used 
in a number of domains, studies dealing with his-
torical corpora are mostly comparatively recent 
(see for instance the recent workshop on historical 
text mining; 
<http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/events/htm06/>).  
Shoemaker (2005) reports on how the Old Bai-
ley Proceedings, which contain accounts of trials 
that took place at the Old Bailey, the primary 
criminal court in London, between 1674 and 1834, 
was marked up for a number of semantic catego-
ries, including the crime date and location, the de-
fendant?s gender, the victim?s name etc. Most of 
the work was done manually while support was 
provided for automatic person name3 identification 
(cf. Bontcheva et al, 2002). The author mentions 
future plans to take advantage of the structured 
nature of the Proceedings and to use the lists of 
persons, locations and occupations that have al-
ready been compiled for annotating new texts.  
Crane and Jones (2006) discuss the evaluation of 
the extraction of 10 named entity classes (personal 
names, locations, dates, products, organizations, 
streets, newspapers, ships, regiments and railroads) 
from a 19th century newspaper. The quality of 
their results vary for different entity types, from 
99.3% precision for Streets to 57.5% precision for 
Products. The authors suggest the kinds of knowl-
edge that digital libraries need to assemble as part 
of their machine readable reference collections in 
order to support entity identification as a core ser-
vice, namely, the need for bigger authority lists, 
more refined rule sets and rich knowledge sources 
as training data. 
At least least two projects are also relevant in 
the context of NER and historical text processing, 
namely NORA <http://www.noraproject.org/> and 
ARMADILLO 
<http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/armadillo/>. The goal 
of the first is to produce text mining software for 
discovering, visualizing, and exploring significant 
patterns across large collections of full-text hu-
manities resources in existing digital libraries. The 
goal of the latter is to evaluate the benefits of 
automated mining techniques (including informa-
tion extraction) on a set of online resources in 
eighteenth-century British social history.

4 Named Entity Recognition 
Named entity recognition (NER) or entity identifi-
cation/extraction, is an important supporting tech-
nology with numerous applications in a number of 
human language technologies. The system we use 
originates from the work conducted in the Nomen 
Nescio project; for details see Johannessen et al 
(2005). In brief, the Swedish system is a multi-
purpose NER system, comprised by a number of 
modules applied in a pipeline fash-ion. Six major 
components can be distinguished, making a clear 
separation between lexical, gram-matical and proc-
essing resources. The six compo-nents are: 
? lists of multiword names, taken from 
various Internet sites or extracted from vari-
ous corpora, running directly over the to-
kenised text being processed; 
? a rule-based, shallow parsing component 
that uses finite-state grammars, one gram-
mar for each type of entity recognized; 
? a module that uses the annotations pro-
duced by the previous two components, 
which have a high rate in precision, in order 
to make decisions regarding other un-
annotated entities. This module is further 
discussed in Section 4.2; 
? lists of single names (approx. 100,000); 
? name similarity, this module is further 
discussed in Section 4.3; 
? a theory revision and refinement mod-
ule, which makes a final control of an anno-
tated document, in order to detect and re-
solve possible errors and assign new annota-
tions based on existing ones, for instance by 
applying name similarity or by combining 
various annotation fragments. 
4.1 Named-Entity Taxonomy 
The nature and type of named entities vary depend-
ing on the task under investigation or the target 
application. In any case, personal names, location 
and organization names are considered ?generic?. 
Since semantic annotation is not as well under-
stood as grammatical annotation, there is no con-
sensus on a standard tagset and content to be gen-
erally applicable. Recently, however, there have 
been attempts to define and apply richer name hi-
erarchies for various tasks, both specific (Fleisch-
man and Hovy, 2002) and generic (Sekine, 2004). 
Our current system implements a rather fine-
grained named entity taxonomy with 8 main 
named entitiy types as well as 57 subtypes. Details 
can be found in Johannessen et al, 2005, and Kok-
kinakis, 2004. The eight main categories are: 
? Person (PRS): people names (forenames, 
surnames), groups of people, animal/pet 
names, mythological, theonyms; 
? Location (LOC): functional locations, 
geographical, geo-political, astrological; 
? Organization (ORG): political, athletic, 
media, military, etc.; 
? Artifact (OBJ): food/wine products, 
prizes, communic. means (vehicles) etc.; 
? Work&Art (WRK): printed material, 
names of films and novels, sculptures etc.; 
? Event (EVN): religious, athletic, scien-
tific, cultural etc.; 
? Measure/Numerical (MSR): volume, age, 
index, dosage, web-related, speed etc.; 
? Temporal (TME). 
Time expressions are important since they allow 
temporal reasoning about complex events as well 
as time-line visualization of the story developed in 
a text. The temporal expressions recognized in-
clude both relative (n?sta vecka ?next week?) and 
absolute expressions (klockan 8 p? morgonen i dag 
?8 o?clock in the morning today?), and sets or se-
quences of time points or stretches of time (varje 
dag ?every day?). 
4.2 Animacy Recognition 
The rule-based component of the person-name rec-
ognition grammar is based on a large set of desig-
nator words and a group of phrases and verbal 
predicates that most probably require an animate 
subject (e.g. ber?tta ?to tell?, fundera ?to think?, 
tr?ttna ?to become tired?). These are used in con-
junction with orthographic markers in the text, 
such as capitalization, for the recognition of per-
sonal names. In this work, we consider the first 
group (designators) as relevant knowledge to be 
extracted from the person name recognizer, which 
is explored for the annotation of animate instances 
3
in the literary texts. The designators are imple-
mented as a separate module in the current pipe-
line, and constitute a piece of information which is 
considered important for a wide range of tasks (cf. 
Orasan and Evans, 2001). 
The designators are divided into four groups: 
designators that denote the nationality or the eth-
nic/racial group of a person (e.g. tysken ?the Ger-
man [person]?); designators that denote a profes-
sion (e.g. l?karen ?the doctor?); those that denote 
family ties and relationships (e.g. sv?rson ?son in 
law?); and finally a group that indicates a human 
individual but cannot be unambiguously catego-
rized into any of the three other groups (e.g. pa-
tienten ?the patient?). Apart from this grouping, 
inherent qualities, for at least a large group of the 
designators, (internal evidence/morphological 
cues) also indicate referent (natural) gender. In this 
way, the animacy annotation is further specified 
for male, female or unknown gender; unknown in 
this context means unresolved or ambiguous, such 
as barn ?child?.  
Swedish is a compounding language and com-
pound words are written as a single orthographic 
unit (i.e. solid compounds). This fact makes the 
recognition of animacy straightforward with mini-
mal resources and feasible by the use of a set of 
suitable headwords, and by capturing modifiers by 
simple regular expressions. Approximately 25 pat-
terns are enough to identify the vast majority of 
animate entities in a text; patterns such as 
?inna/innan/innor?, ?man/mannen/m?n/m?nnen?, 
?log/logen/loger?, ?kt?r/kt?ren/kt?rer? and 
?iker/ikern/ikerna?. For instance, the pattern in (1) 
consists of a reliable suffix ?inna? which is a typi-
cal designator for female individuals, preceded by 
a set of obligatory strings and an optional regular 
expression which captures a long list of com-
pounds (2). 
(1) [a-z???]*(kv|?lskar|man|grev|?)inna 
(2) taleskvinna, yrkeskvinna, idrotts-
kvinna, ungkvinna, Stockholmskvin-
na, Dalakvinna, sambo?lskarinna, 
lyx?lskarinna, ex-?lskarinna, sam-
largrevinna, ex?lskarinna, markgre-
vinna, majgrevinna, ?nkegrevinna,? 
Examples of animacy annotations are given in (3). 
The attribute value FAM stands for FAmily relation 
and Male; PRM for PRofession and Male; FAF for 
FAmily relation and Female and finally UNF for 
UNknown and Female.

Table (3) in Section 6.1 presents the results for the 
evaluation of this type of normative information. 
Note also, that in order to make the annotations 
more practical we have included the person name 
designators (e.g. ?herr? ? ?Mr?) in the markup as in 
(4); here PRS stands for PeRSon: 
(4) <ENAMEX TYPE="UNM">Herr</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRS" SBT="HUM">Boman 
</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE= 
"PRS-UNM" SBT="HUM">Herr Boman 
</ENAMEX> 
4.3 Name Similarity 
We can safely assume that the various system re-
sources will not be able to identify all possible en-
tities in the texts, particularly personal and location 
names. Although there is a large overlap between 
the names in the texts and the gazetteer lists, there 
were cases that could be considered as entity can-
didates but were left unmarked. This is because 
exhaustive lists of names even for limited domains 
are hard to obtain, and, in some domains even dif-
ficult to manage. Therefore, we also calculated the 
orthographic similarity between such words and 
the gazetteer content, according to the following 
criteria: a potential entity starts with a capital let-
ter; it is ? 5 characters long; it is not part of any 
other annotation and it does not stand in the begin-
ning of a sentence. We have empirically observed 
that the length of 5 characters is a reliable thresh-
old, unlikely to exclude many NEs. As a matter of 
fact, only two such cases could be found in the 
evaluation sample, namely ?tten Puff ?the family 
Puff? and ?Yen-? in the context ?Yen- kenberg? 
As measure of orthographic similarity (or rather, 
difference) we used the Levenshtein distance (LD; 
also known as edit distance) between two strings. 
The LD is the number of deletions, insertions or 
substitutions required to transform a string into 
another string. The greater the distance, the more 
different the strings are. We chose to regard 1 and 
2 as trustworthy values and disregarded the rest. 
We chose these two values since empirical obser-
vations suggest that contemporary Swedish and 
4
19th century Swedish entities usually differ in one 
or two characters. In case of more than one match, 
we choose the most frequent alternative, as in the 
case of Wenern below. Table 1 illustrates various 
cases and the obtained results.

5 The Document Centered Approach 
There is a known tradeoff between rule-based and 
statistical systems. Handcrafted grammar-based 
systems typically obtain better results, but at the 
cost of considerable manual effort by domain ex-
perts. Statistical NER systems typically require a 
large amount of manually annotated training data, 
but can be ported to other domains or genres more 
rapidly and require less manual work. Although the 
Swedish system is mainly rule-based, using a 
handcrafted grammar for each entity group, it can 
also be considered a hybrid system in the sense 
that it applies a document-centered approach 
(DCA) to entity annotation, which is a different 
paradigm compared to the local context approach, 
called external evidence by McDonald (1996). 
With DCA, information for the disambiguation of 
a name is derived from the entire document.  
DCA as a term originates from the work by 
Mikheev (2000: 138), who claims that: 
 
important words are typically used in a 
document more than once and in different 
contexts. Some of these contexts create 
very ambiguous situations but some don?t. 
Furthermore, ambiguous words and 
phrases are usually unambiguously intro-
duced at least once in the text unless they 
are part of common knowledge presup-
posed to be known by the readers. 
 
This implies a form of online learning from the 
document being processed where unambiguous 
usages are used for assigning annotations to am-
biguous words, and information for disambiguation 
is derived from the entire document.  
Similarly, label consistency, the preference of 
the same annotation for the same word sequence 
everywhere in a particular discourse, is a compara-
ble approach for achieving qualitatively higher re-
call rates with minimal resource overhead (cf. 
Krishnan and Manning, 2006). Such an approach 
has been used, e.g., by Aramaki et al (2006), for 
the identification of personal health information 
(age, id, date, phone, location and doctor?s and pa-
tient?s names). 
Figure 1. Example of label consistency 
 
Figure 1 illustrates this approach with an example 
taken from Almqvist?s Collected Works, Vol. 30. In 
this example, the first occurrence of the female 
person name Micmac, which is not in the gazetteer 
lists, is introduced by the author with the unambi-
guous designator faster ?aunt?. Many of the subse-
quent mentions of the same name are given with-
out any reliable clue for appropriate labelling. 
However, as already discussed, there is strong evi-
dence that subsequent mentions of the same name 
should be annotated with the same label, and since 
the same entity usually appears more than once in 
the same discourse, in our case a book, labelling 
consistency should guarantee better performance. 
There are exceptions for certain NE categories 
which may consist of words that are not proper 
nouns such as in the Work&Art category, and of 
course the temporal and measure groups which are 
blocked from this type of processing; cf. section 
6.2. 
6 Evaluation and Error Analysis 
The system was evaluated twice, while no nor-
malization or other preprocessing was applied to 
the original documents. Problems identified during 
the first evaluation round were taken under consid-
eration and specific changes were suggested to the 
system by incorporating appropriate modifications. 
5
During the first run, no adaptations or enhance-
ments were made to the original NER system. Af-
ter the first evaluation round, four major areas 
were identified in which the system either failed to 
produce an annotation or produced only partial or 
erroneous annotations. These failures were caused 
by: 
? Spelling variation: particularly the use of 
<f/w/e/q> instead of <v/v/?/k> as in modern 
Swedish. Most of the cases could be easily 
solved while other required different means 
such as calculating the LD between the 
name lists and possible name mentions in 
the texts (Section 4.3). One case that could 
be easily tackled was the addition of alter-
nate spelling forms for a handful of key-
words and designators, especially the prepo-
sition av/af common in temporal contexts, 
such as i b?rjan af/av 1790-talet ?in the be-
ginning of the 1790s?; or words such 
begge/b?gge ?both? and qv?ll/kv?ll ?eve-
ning?; 
? A number of definite plural forms of 
nouns, often designating a group of persons, 
with the suffix ?erne? instead the ?erna? as 
in modern Swedish, such as Kine-
serne/Kineserna ?the Chinese [people]? and 
Svenskarne/Svenskarna ?the Swedes?; 
? Unknown names: mentioned once with 
unreliable context; 
? Structure preservation: the document 
structure of the texts in Litteraturbankens is 
designed to create a faithful rendering of the 
visual appearance of the original printed 
books. In extracting the texts from the XML 
format used in Litteraturbanken, we did not 
want to apply any kind of normalization or 
other processing. Such an approach would 
have altered the document structure. This 
implies that for a handful of the entities, for 
which the hyphenation in the original paper 
version has divided a name into two parts, as 
in (5), correct identification cannot be ac-
complished, while in some cases only a par-
tial identification was possible, as in (6).

6.1 Results 
As a baseline for the evaluation we use the result 
of simple dictionary lookup in the single name 
gazetteer. This process is very accurate (w.r.t. pre-
cision). We could identify a number of cases with 
erroneous annotations, due to various circum-
stances: Names in the gazetteer lists may have 
multiple entity tags associated with them, and thus 
an entity may belong to more than one group that 
could not be disambiguated by the surrounding 
context, such as Ekhammar as a city and surname; 
many names are ambiguous with common nouns 
or verbs, such as Stig as a first name and as the 
verb ?step/walk?; the gazetteers contained a num-
ber of words that should not have been in the list in 
the first place, such as Hvem ?Who?, styrman ?first 
mate? and f?nrik ?lieutenant?. A probable cause of 
the latter problem is the fact that the name lists 
have been semi-automatically compiled from vari-
ous sources including corpora and the Internet.  
We performed two evaluations, based on two 
different random samples consisting of 500 seg-
ments (roughly 30,000 tokens) each. A segment 
consists of an integral number of sentences (up to 
10?20). The overall results for all tests are shown 
in table 2. Results for individual entities using the 
whole system during both runs are found in table 3. 
The samples were evaluated according to preci-
sion, recall and f-score using the formulas: 
 
Precision = (Total Correct + Partially Corrtect) /  
All Produced 
Recall = (Total Correct + Partially Correct) /  
All Possible 
F-score =2*P*R/P+R.

named entities including animacy 
 
Partially correct means that an annotation gets par-
tial credit. For instance, if the system produces an 
annotation for the functional location Nya Elemen-
tarskolan as in (7) instead of the correct (8), then 
such annotations are given half a point, instead of a 
perfect score. 
(7) Nya <ENAMEX TYPE=?LOC? SBT=?FNC?> 
Elementarskolan</ENAMEX> 
(8) <ENAMEX TYPE=?LOC? SBT=?FNC?>Nya 
Elementarskolan</ENAMEX> 
If, on the other hand, the type is correct but the 
subtype is wrong, then the annotation is given a 
score of 0.75 points (e.g. a functional location in-
stead of a geopolitical location). 
6.2 Limitations of the Centering Approach 
Labeling consistency and the DCA approach relies 
on the assumption that usage is consistent within 
the same document by the same author. However, 
we have observed that there are problems with en-
tities composed of more than a single word, par-
ticularly within the group Work&Art, which can 
produce conflicting information, if we allow the 
individual words in such content (often nouns or 
adjectives) to be re-applied in the text. 
For instance, the name of the novel Syster och 
bror occurred 32 times in one of the evaluation 
texts (Almqvist?s Collected Works Volume 29). If 
we allow the individual words that constitute the 
title, Syster, och and bror to be re-applied in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
text as individual words (2 common nouns and a 
conjunction), then we would have degraded the 
precision considerably since we would have al-
lowed Work&Art annotations for irrelevant words. 
However, such cases can be resolved by simply 
letting the system ignore multiword Work&Art 
annotations during the DCA processing. 
 
 
Figure 2. Occurrences of the multi-word entity Sys-
ter och bror; the rule-based system could reliably 
identify and annotate 2/32 occurrences. 
 
Generally speaking, the experimental results have 
shown that any breaking of a multiword entity, 
except personal names, into its individual words 
often has a negative effect on performance. The 
best results are achieved when the DCA approach 
deals with single or bigram entities, particularly 
personal names.

7 Conclusions and Future Prospects 
In this paper we have described the application of a 
generic Swedish named entity recognition system 
to a number of literary texts, novels from the 19th 
century, part of Litteraturbanken, the Swedish Lit-
erature Bank. We evaluated the results of the 
named entity recognition and identified a number 
of error sources which we tried to resolve and then 
introduce changes that would cover for such cases 
in the rule-based component of the system, in order 
to increase its performance (precision and recall) 
during a second evaluation round. 
Entity annotations open up a whole new re-
search spectrum for new kinds of qualitative and 
quantitative exploitations of literary and historical 
texts, allowing more semantically-oriented explo-
ration of the textual content. In the near future, we 
will annotate and evaluate a larger sample and pos-
sibly integrate machine learning techniques in or-
der to improve the results even more. We are also 
working to integrate the handling of named entity 
annotations into Litteraturbanken?s search and 
browsing interfaces and hope to be able to conduct 
our first demonstrations and tests with users later 
this year.
