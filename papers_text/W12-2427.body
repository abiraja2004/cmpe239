Abstract 
Publications that report genotype-drug inte-
raction findings, as well as manually curated 
databases such as DrugBank and PharmGKB 
are essential to advancing pharmacogenomics, 
a relatively new area merging pharmacology 
and genomic research. Natural language 
processing (NLP) methods can be very useful 
for automatically extracting knowledge such 
as gene-drug interactions, offering researchers 
immediate access to published findings, and 
allowing curators a shortcut for their work.   
We present a corpus of gene-drug interac-
tions for evaluating and training systems to 
extract those interactions.  The corpus in-
cludes 551 sentences that have a mention of a 
drug and a gene from about 600 journals 
found to be relevant to pharmacogenomics 
through an analysis of gene-drug relationships 
in the PharmGKB knowledgebase.  
We evaluated basic approaches to auto-
matic extraction, including gene and drug co-
occurrence, co-occurrence plus interaction 
terms, and a linguistic pattern-based method.  
The linguistic pattern method had the highest 
precision (96.61%) but lowest recall (7.30%), 
for an f-score of 13.57%. Basic co-occurrence 
yields 68.99% precision, with the addition of 
an interaction term precision increases slightly 
(69.60%), though not as much as could be ex-
pected. Co-occurrence is a reasonable base-
line method, with pattern-based being a prom-
ising approach if enough patterns can be gen-
erated to address recall. The corpus is availa-
ble at http://diego.asu.edu/index.php/projects 
1 Introduction 
Pharmacogenomics is a relatively new area of 
biomedical research that merges pharmacology and 
molecular genomics, among other disciplines, and 
focuses on studying the effects of genetic variabili-
ty on drug toxicity and efficacy, on the discovery 
of novel genomic targets for drug development, 
and on the identification and functional characteri-
zation of polymorphisms relevant to drug action.  
Thus, publications that report genotype-drug find-
ings and manually curated databases that collect 
such findings, like PharmGKB and DrugBank 
(Hewett et al., 2002; Wishart, 2006) are of para-
mount importance to the field.  However, manual 
curation is expensive and time consuming, and 
cannot keep up with the ever increasing number of 
publications.  Natural language processing (NLP) 
methods can be very useful for automatically ex-
tracting such gene-drug interactions, offering re-
searchers immediate access to published findings, 
and allowing curators a shortcut for their work. 
 Consider for example a sentence contain-
ing an interaction NLP can help extract:  ?Only the 
epsilon4 allele of APOE was found to make a sig-
nificant (P = 0.002) but small contribution to war-
farin dose requirement.? (PMID: 16847429).  We 
can easily see that in the sentence, an APOE allele 
interacts with the drug warfarin in its dose re-
quirement.   Furthermore, at a higher level of ab-
straction, the sentence can help researchers infer 
that APOE affects the metabolic processes targeted 
by the drug warfarin. 
 NLP researchers attacking an interaction 
extraction project such as this one, will usually 
start by identifying the entities involved in the ex-
tractions and the terms that indicate such interac-
tions.  Assuming named entity recognition (NER) 
systems exist for the entities in question (or a dic-
tionary is available for direct match), the main 
concern becomes extracting true interactions.  A 
gold standard corpus would then need to be identi-
fied or created in order to evaluate and develop 
interaction extraction approaches, starting with the 
214
simplest ones.  We aim to support advancement in 
the area of gene-drug interaction extraction 
through the construction of a corpus for that task 
that offers advantages not available in another sim-
ilar corpus.  Also for that support we report on a 
study of the capabilities of different methods for 
that form of extraction. 
To achieve our aim, we describe a new 
corpus of gene-drug interactions, and compare the 
performance of two basic approaches plus the re-
implementation of a more advanced pattern-based 
approach measured against this corpus.  We do not 
seek in this publication to advance the extraction 
methods themselves, but allow a side-to-side com-
parison of approaches on a single corpus. 
 The sentences in the corpus (a total of 551) 
were randomly selected from sentences that in-
clude both a gene and a drug mention from the ab-
stracts published on a selection of journals that 
have articles relevant to pharmacogenomics. In 
general, annotations include interactions evident 
from the sentence, if any, also noting when men-
tioned genes or drugs are not involved in interac-
tions.  All sentences were annotated by the main 
author, with a second and third annotator verifying 
26% of the corpus.  The corpus is publicly availa-
ble online along with other supplementary mate-
rials including the annotation guide1.  
 The extraction methods evaluated include 
co-occurrence of a gene and a drug, co-occurrence 
of a gene and a drug plus a recognized interaction 
term, and one that uses specific linguistic patterns 
for classification based on (Coulet, Shah, Garten, 
Musen, & Altman, 2010).  The linguistic pattern 
method had the highest precision (96.61%) but 
lowest recall (7.30%), for an f-score of 13.57%. 
Basic co-occurrence yields 68.99% precision, with 
the addition of an interaction term increasing pre-
cision slightly (69.60%), though not as much as 
could be expected.  Analysis of our results show 
that performance could be immediately improved 
by improving the fundamental entity-recognition 
of drugs and genes.  
2 Related Work 
A good portion of the work presented here follows 
prior approaches to high quality protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) corpora development and extrac-

tion.  Given that our corpus contains genes and 
proteins as entities, procedures used to create PPI 
corpora were a useful resource.  A variety of anno-
tation decisions made were informed by the work 
of Pyysalo et. al. on their BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo 
et al., 2007).  A detailed annotation guide used in 
their work was referenced in annotation rules in 
this work.  Other corpora, such as the ones used in 
Biocreative challenges, have also made valuable 
contributions to PPI extraction progress (Haken-
berg et al., 2010; Krallinger, Leitner, Rodriguez-
Penagos, & Valencia, 2008). 
 Unlike for PPI interaction extraction, there 
are very limited currently available corpora that 
can be used for automatic gene-drug interaction 
extraction system development and evaluation.  
One corpus that contains those interactions is a 300 
sentence corpus by Ahlers et al. (Ahlers, Fiszman, 
Demner-Fushman, Lang, & Rindflesch, 2007).  
The Ahlers et. al. corpus include the biological 
interaction categories of inhibit, and stimulate in 
addition to interaction annotations for genes and 
drugs.  Our corpus does not contain those addition-
al categories directly, but the interaction words that 
are annotated in our corpus can indicate such cate-
gories as well as others.  All in all, our focus was 
on creating a corpus that could be used for evalua-
tion of basic as well as complex approaches, and 
allow machine-learning based systems to be 
trained on it. 
Current systems for extracting gene-drug 
interactions are based on entity co-occurrence and 
some include matching of relationship terms.  
Those systems commonly use statistical formulas 
for ranking the relevance of results.  Polysearch, 
Pharmspresso, and others are examples of such 
systems (Cheng et al., 2008; Garten & Altman, 
2009).  Some systems integrate linguistic patterns 
into their methods, such as those by Coulet et. al. 
and Tari et. al. (Luis Tari, J?rg Hakenberg, Gracie-
la Gonzalez, & Baral, 2009).  The system by Cou-
let et al. explores the value of dependency graph 
information for relationship extraction.  Another 
result of Coulet et. al.'s work was the Phare ontol-
ogy that includes concepts relevant to those rela-
tionships, which we utilize in this work. The value 
of such collections of interaction-indicating terms 
has been highlighted before in the biomedical rela-
tionship extraction context (Bui, Nuall?in, Bouch-
er, & Sloot, 2010; Chowdhary, Zhang, & Liu, 
2009).

3 Materials and Methods  
3.1  Corpus design. 
The purpose for the creation of the new corpus was 
to create a resource that NLP developers can use to 
train and test gene-drug interaction extraction sys-
tems.  The corpus was based on articles from jour-
nals that are known to contain pharmacogenomic 
relationships.  Genes and drugs were automatically 
tagged and then 551 sentences that contain both a 
gene and drug were randomly selected for annota-
tion.  The corpus and sentence selection process is 
described in the following subsections.  
 
Journal Selection.  A list of journals relevant to 
pharmacogenomics was generated by extracting 
the journal names from articles that have been cu-
rated in PharmGKB as containing evidence of 
gene-drug relationships. This list was generated 
from their downloadable ?relationships? file, 
which contains the abstract IDs of articles with 
manually curated gene-drug relationships.  591 
journal names were obtained this way.  The goal of 
using only those journals is to make the corpus 
representative of typical sentences containing a 
gene and drug from literature known to report 
pharmacogenomic findings. 
 
Sentence processing. All abstracts in PubMed from 
the relevant journal names were downloaded. A 
sentence splitter program from OpenNLP was used 
to extract sentences from the abstracts (?The 
OpenNLP Homepage,? n.d.).  A total of 
22,601,402 sentences were processed.  
 
Identification of entites.  Previous work in pharma-
cogenomics relationship extraction has shown ef-
fective results by classifying relationships after 
identifying sentences with entities of interest 
through dictionary matching techniques (Garten & 
Altman, 2009; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2007).  
Our work takes a similar approach, but utilizes a 
machine-learning based method, BANNER, for 
gene recognition, as it was shown to have better 
performance than a dictionary-based method 
(Leaman & Gonzalez, 2008). Drugs were recog-
nized through the use of dictionary matching.  The 
dictionaries used for drugs were based on drug 
names available at DrugBank.  Exact full token 
matching of drug terms was used to identify them 
in sentences. Although incorrectly tagged (false 
entity) genes and drugs were corrected by annota-
tors, they did not add entities missed by NER rec-
ognition. A second round of annotation will correct 
this when we shift focus to NER. 
 Terms indicative of an interaction for add-
ing to basic co-occurrence relationship extraction 
were extracted from the Phare ontology.  The 
terms acquired were from rdfs labeled text in the 
?object properties? in the ontology.  Object proper-
ties are elements of the ontology that describe rela-
tionships between classes such as gene and drugs, 
yielding 168 unique terms after stemming. 
 
Sentence selection.  The initial annotation effort 
that is the focus of this paper was aimed at com-
pleting around 500 sentences as a proof of concept, 
with a total of 1,500 to be completed in the second 
phase of this project.  Random selection of sen-
tences that include a gene and a drug, in contrast to 
balanced positive and negative selection, was used 
to make the corpus reflect typical sentences poten-
tially containing an interaction that can be easily 
extracted from the source articles after simple 
(drug and gene) concept tagging, which is the most 
basic approach to interaction extraction.  The ran-
domized ratio of positive and negative interactions 
in the corpus is useful for training classification 
systems that operate on similarly pre-processed 
sentences to account for that naturally occurring 
ratio. 
 
3.2  Annotation. 
An annotation tool named STAV was used to 
create annotations (?stav,? n.d.).  Customization of 
the tool was performed to match the types of anno-
tations needed for the corpus.  The identified enti-
ties were formatted for use with the tool.  Annota-
tions created with the tool were stored in the Bi-
oNLP shared task file format. That format is com-
patible with a variety of existing systems for rela-
tionship extraction.  
 
Annotation guidelines. Based on a review of litera-
ture on related annotation guidelines for relation-
ships such as PPIs, an initial annotation guideline 
was created based on a small sample of sentences.  
The guide was iteratively refined through annota-
tion of additional sentences, until considered suffi-
ciently stable for release to additional annotators.   
The guideline was refined to achieve a bal-
ance of complexity and clarity to assist annotators.  
216
Only a few (5-10) example sentences per annotator 
have been discussed in person.  The explicit writ-
ten instructions in the guide were relied on more 
than in-person example sentence discussions to 
train annotators to handle the complicated content 
of the corpus and avoid over-influencing the anno-
tators, as noted that is possible with the overuse of 
those examples (Hovy & Lavid, 2008). 
 The first annotator, a student with a Bache-
lor of Science (BS) in Biology, was the main anno-
tator and author of the guidelines. The second and 
third annotators are PhD students in Biomedical 
Informatics, the second with a BS in Biology and 
10 years nursing experience, and the other with a 
Bachelor of Technology in Bioinformatics.  Week-
ly annotation meetings were done on individual 
bases.  A short checklist of things to look for in 
annotations was distributed in addition to the 
guidelines. 
 
Annotations.  The following describes major anno-
tation categories and subcategories in the corpus:  
 
? Interaction  Genes and drugs are annotated 
simply as ?having an interaction? broadly un-
derstood as having an ?action, effect, or influ-
ence? on each other.  All gene-drug interac-
tions annotated must have at least one interac-
tion term that helps explain the interaction.  
Additional properties that were annotated and 
a brief explanation of their purpose include: 
o Direct/Indirect:  Describes the complexi-
ty in the interaction statements. An ?indi-
rect? interaction is one where the presence 
of an intermediary entity is needed for se-
mantic understanding of the interaction. 
o Explicit/Inferred:  Records if an infe-
rence had to be made on whether the inte-
raction was present because an interaction 
was not explicitly stated. 
? Non-interaction 
o Shared Entity:  An entity connected to 
both a gene and a drug that don't interact 
with each other.  In contrast to an interme-
diary entity. 
? Interaction Term  Terms that are descriptive 
of the interaction (as defined earlier).  These 
terms are helpful for capturing more specifical-
ly the type of interaction present.  
? Intermediary Entity  These are non-gene, 
non-drug entities that are closely connected to 
the interaction.  They are entities that are 
needed for understanding of the full semantic 
meaning of gene-drug interactions.  These enti-
ties are not annotated themselves but they are 
used to determine the indirectness property. 
 
Examples of these categories can be seen in the 
sentence: ?Using standard steady-state kinetic 
analysis, it was demonstrated that paclitaxel was a 
possible uncompetitive inhibitor to NAT activity in 
cytosols based on the decrease in apparent values 
of K(m) and V(max).? (PMID: 11955677).  This 
sentence includes an interaction between the drug 
paclitaxel and gene NAT.  An interaction term that 
helps establish that the interaction is present is ?in-
hibitor?.  ?Cytosols? is where the NAT inhibition 
activity can occur and represents an intermediary 
entity that is needed in the semantic meaning of the 
interaction. 
 The broad definition of interaction was 
used to make progress toward annotations includ-
ing, and in turn being representative of, the most 
general form of gene-drug interaction that is de-
scribed in the source abstracts.  We chose to first 
concentrate on getting good inter-annotator agree-
ment using the general definition before consider-
ing additionally annotating specific biological inte-
raction types.  Annotated interactions are required 
to have at least one annotated interaction term (al-
though terms do not have to be from the predefined 
list) to ensure that specific and identifiable lan-
guage is present that justifies the annotation.   
 The subcategories included were added to 
record the linguistic complexity in which the inte-
ractions and non-interactions are described.  Re-
cording that complexity can help system develop-
ers handle its presence when trying to automatical-
ly recognize interaction statements.  Additionally, 
the annotation properties of speculation, negation, 
and nesting were allowed but not separately anno-
tated in interaction annotations.  
 Each annotator reported annotation time 
estimates.  Total time spent on annotations includ-
ing meetings but not other work (e.g. guideline 
development) was approximately 80 hours for the 
primary annotator and 20 hours combined for other 
annotators.  Hard sentences to annotate required 
research into source articles and entities described.   
 
217
Evaluation of the Corpus. Around 26% of the cor-
pus was annotated by a second and third annotator.  
A program was created for IAA scoring, account-
ing for nested entities and equivalent entities in-
cluding abbreviations.  Manual review was used to 
verify the program?s scores.   Example sentences 
from the corpus discussed with annotators were not 
used for IAA scoring. 
 
3.3  Relationship Extraction methods. 
Three basic methods for extracting interactions 
were implemented for evaluation. The basic me-
thod, co-occurrence, is inherent to the corpus as all 
sentences are selected based on both entities being 
present in them. Thus, in co-occurrence, any men-
tion of a gene and a drug together in a sentence 
represents an interaction between those entities. 
Co-occurrence plus interaction terms, the 
second method tried, identifies that interactions are 
present only when sentences contain an interaction 
word from a predefined list.  The list of interaction 
terms obtained from the Phare ontology was fil-
tered by removing common stop words. Also, a 
filter was applied to only use terms greater than 
two letters in size.  Those filters were used to avoid 
unneeded matches from common words. 
 The linguistic pattern based extraction me-
thod developed for this evaluation was based on 
the work by Coulet et. al.  Specific linguistic pat-
terns described in that work were used to classify 
the presence of interactions between genes and 
drugs.  A program named Graph Spider was used 
to match the specified patterns within sentences 
(Shepherd & Clegg, 2008).  The Stanford Parser 
was used to generate dependency graphs for use 
with the pattern recognition in Graph Spider.   
 The dependency rules designed by Coulet. 
et. al. were entered into Graph Spider using the 
metapattern language (MPL) designed by the 
Graph Spider authors.  MPL is a pattern formalism 
that can be used to match dependency subgraph 
patterns in dependency parsed text.  After depen-
dency graphs were generated for processing in 
Graph Spider, text representing genes and drugs in 
the graphs were converted to general tags for those 
entity types.  Those conversions were made to al-
low the patterns in MPL to be generalizable.  
 Java programs were created to reformat 
and score the subgraph pattern match results made 
by Graph Spider.  Scoring used text character posi-
tions (spans) of entities included in annotations.  
True positives were recorded when pairs of entity 
spans in Graph Spider subgraph results matched 
annotated pairs of entity spans labeled as having 
interactions.  False positives and false negatives 
were similarly assessed using entity spans.  A ma-
nual evaluation of pattern matched output com-
pared to annotations was performed to ensure ac-
curacy. 
 A condition applied in the pattern based 
system was that the patterns can match up to four 
modifier words for each individual gene and drug 
in interaction pattern matches.  Those words are 
additional words that modify the meaning of the 
gene or drug in the interaction.  The limit was in-
cluded for practical reasons, as hand coding of pat-
terns in MPL is complex.  The rules described by 
Coulet et. al. did not specify any limit on modifier 
words but the difference in results by including a 
realistic limit is predicted to be negligible. 
4 Results  
A total of 551 sentences are annotated, with 781 
interactions present in them. There are 351 in-
stances of non-interactive entities in the same set.   
The average length of sentences is 28.1 words.  
Table 1 describes further properties of the corpus.   
 
Annotation Analysis. The inter-annotator agree-
ment scores are reported as accuracy and Cohen?s 
kappa.  Kappa was chosen due to its widespread 
use and therefore comparability with other work in 
corpus creation.  Accuracy is found by the number 
of instances agreed on divided by the total in-
stances annotated.  A total of 144 sentences were 
used for the scoring.  Annotators 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 
and 2 and 3 were compared using 92, 52, and 61 
sentences respectively.  IAA results with the main 
categories of interaction vs. non-interaction are 
shown in Table 2.

 IAA scores were found for all annotated 
subcategories.  Those subcategories are DirectEx-
plicit, IndirectExplicit, IndirectInferred for interac-
tions and SharedEntity for non-interactions.  Their 
ranges of scores with all annotator pair groups us-
ing accuracy scores are 72-79%, 40-69%, 62-82%, 
50-60% and kappa scores are 31-58%, 1-27%, -4-
31%, 0-4% respectively.  Those scores are created 
by selecting main category inter-annotator matches 
(e.g. interaction) and calculating the IAA between 
the annotated subcategories. 
In some sentences, annotators missed 
doing annotations for gene-drug instances that the 
other annotator added. IAA scores did not include 
annotations made by only one annotator.  Confir-
mation with annotators was made that annotations 
not made were not intended to represent non-
interactions.  The percentage of missed inter-
annotator instances was approximately 20%.  Fu-
ture work will be to improve the inter-annotator 
annotation process so that those instances are not 
missed for IAA scoring.  While some annotations 
were missed in IAA scoring, annotations by the 
primary annotator that are included in the corpus 
contain all instances (none missed) from the source 
text to our knowledge.

Note that sentences were selected based on co-
occurrence of a gene and a drug, thus recall is 
100% for that method, as it essentially defines 
the corpus. 
 
 
The scoring methods used were instance 
level scoring instead of sentence level scoring.  In 
the instance level scoring each gene-drug instance 
counted in performance scores.   
 A caveat about the pattern-based system 
scoring should be noted.  That caveat was that the 
Graph Spider software used was unable to process 
approximately 10% (around 50) of the sentences in 
the corpus due to errors.  The pattern-based system 
is likely to have scored slightly higher if it could 
have processed those sentences.

The f-score of co-occurrence with and without in-
teraction terms showed better performance than the 
pattern-based interaction extractions, which was 
expected. Pattern based methods, particularly those 
where the patterns were manually created, are typi-
cally very high in precision and very low in recall, 
as they are highly dependant on the specific pat-
terns included for recognition. Although recall was 
low, users who want very high confidence interac-
tion predictions or interactions of a very specific 
type can benefit from the pattern-based system?s 
demonstrated high precision. Co-occurrence can 
suit users who want to focus on recall. 
Coulet et al. reported their system scored a 
precision of 70% for exact match and 87.7% for 
exact or incomplete match but true classification.  
Our results are similar to their 87.7% results in 
both percentage and scoring method.  The method 
that allows incompleteness accepts matches that 
accurately identify core pharmacogenomic rela-
tionships but don?t need to correctly match modifi-
er words.  Our scoring is similar in not needing to 
match modifier words.  The similarity in results 
indicates that we correctly implemented the system 
that Coulet et al. designed.  That indication does 
have the limitation that the 10% of sentences una-
ble to be processed may have affected the results. 
An example of a more complex interaction 
that was matched by co-occurrence with an inte-
raction term but not the pattern-based method was 
?Moreover, S-nitrosylation of thioredoxin was also 
significantly augmented after atorvastatin treat-
ment.? (PMID: 15289372).  In that sentence, an 
interaction occurred where thioredoxin's (gene) S-
nitrosylation was augmented by atorvastatin 
(drug).  Analysis of the dependency graphs used by 
the pattern-based system revealed some reasons 
why it was unable to identify the interaction.  
 The pattern-based system uses a rule that 
applies to that sentence: a potential pattern se-
quence match can be ?interrupted? by a dependen-
cy that does not fit accepted patterns.  In the non-
classified sentence, the entities ?was? and ?aug-
mented? were terms that caused the pattern match-
ing to be interrupted.  Both ?was? and ?aug-
mented? are not nouns or prepositions.  They both 
also are needed in the dependency subgraph that 
connects the gene and drug together.  Those parts 
of speech are not allowed to be chained together in 
the pattern-based system's patterns.  That deviation 
from the allowed patterns caused the system to 
miss that interaction. 
Adding patterns with more diversity in al-
lowed parts of speech in series of interaction terms 
that connect genes and drugs in interactions can 
improve recall performance.  A review of parts of 
speech (POS) in missed matches showed that some 
misses were due to no verb POS tags being present 
in interaction descriptions.  That can occur when 
verbs are in their nominalized form or other situa-
tions.  Mining the corpus for both part of speech 
and dependency graph patterns can identify pat-
terns that are able to correct those misses.  Also, 
the POS tagger included with the parser mis-
tagged a variety of words.  Using a higher perfor-
mance tagger or one trained on biomedical text 
may help with pattern matches.  
Ahlers et. al. also reported relationship ex-
traction performance from a new system with their 
gene-drug corpus.  That system achieved a preci-
sion of 73% and recall of 50% extracting an anno-
tation category including gene-drug relationships.  
The system is built upon an earlier system and an 
important part of its capabilities comes from spe-
cialized linguistic rules it uses.  The corpus in-
cluded in this work can be useful for further devel-
opment of systems that integrate such rules with 
other methods to improve extraction performances. 
Some characteristics were notable about 
the results of the methods using co-occurrence 
with and without interaction terms.  The perfor-
mances found of those methods may be specific to 
an increased amount of gene-drug interactions 
found in the journals used compared to other jour-
nals.  Also, the use of interaction terms from the 
Phare ontology was expected to increase precision 
because they were found from predicted pharma-
cogenomic relationships.  The co-occurrence with 
interaction terms method resulted in only approx-
imately equaling the precision of basic co-
occurrence.  One possible reason for that is the 
terms were originally found partly with disease 
relationships.  They therefore can be less relevant 
to gene-drug interactions.   
 
5.2  Analyses of annotations 
Table 2 includes that the general interaction anno-
tations had the kappa values 46%, 30%, 11% 
which are considered only moderate to low scores 
by common rating methods.  Some IAA scores, 
such as kappa, include a correction for chance 
220
agreement probability.  An intentional design 
choice was made in the corpus to allow an unba-
lanced but natural ratio of interactions to non-
interactions.  That imbalance increased kappa?s 
correction.  Although our reasonably high IAA 
scores with accuracy helped increase the kappa 
score, they were not enough to offset the correction 
and bring kappa above the moderate score.   
 An article by Strijbos et. al. states that 
kappa can have a strict chance agreement correc-
tion in the case of few categories (Strijbos, Mar-
tens, Prins, & Jochems, 2006).  Given that general 
interaction scores were only based on the catego-
ries of present or absent, kappa may have been 
overly strict with the correction.  If that correction 
in our data is not strict, but justified, than that indi-
cates how further improving our annotation 
process can be valuable.  Further investigation will 
go into understanding what statistics may be useful 
for scoring given the corpus properties.  Explora-
tion will also continue with talking to annotator s 
about what may be causing disagreement.  That 
exploration will help reveal ways to improve IAA. 
 Subcategories showed mixed results in 
their IAA performances.  The subcategories with 
the highest IAA scores may indicate that those 
subcategories are more clearly defined than others 
in the annotation guide. 
 Reviewing some annotated sentences can 
help clarify how the IAA results occurred.  All an-
notators agreed the drug galantamine has a direct 
explicit interaction with cholinesterase in sentence 
A in Table 3.  Such an interaction description is 
simply described and an annotator has reported 
that type of interaction being the easiest to identify.   
 Agreement was found with all annotators 
for annotations in sentence B in Table 3.  It was 
readily understandable to annotators that calcium 
and other signal transduction systems do not have 
an interaction simply for all being a part of those 
types of systems. 
 An example of a sentence with annotator 
disagreement was sentence C in table 3. Although 
endogenously produced in this case, the nested 
entity creatine was considered a drug due to being 
relevant to creatine in its exogenous drug form. 
 The occurrence of multiple properties, 
such as inhibition and effects on hearts can make it 
difficult to follow the logic of the interaction be-
tween creatine and adenylate kinase (enzyme).  
The interaction annotation can be hard for annota-
tors to find due to that complexity and the subtle-
ness of the ?in spite of? phrase describing the ne-
gated effect between the drug and gene.  The inte-
raction is negated but that still is considered an 
interaction by the annotation rules used. 
   
5.3  Future Work 
As mentioned before, the corpus will grow from 
around 500 sentences that it has right now to 
around 1,500.  The larger the corpus expands to be, 
the more representative it will become of gene-
drug interactions.  Other future work includes work 
with more advanced interaction extraction systems. 
Along with this publication, a version of 
the corpus with high confidence in annotations will 
be released.  Given that this is an initial work, a 
relatively modest amount of annotation revisions 
may occur with a few periodic later version releas-
es of the corpus to improve its quality. 
 Unfortunately no tagger is perfect so as 
annotations proceed, drugs or genes that were 
missed by the tagger can be investigated to further 
understand why that occurred.  An example of a 
commonly missed drug was acetylcholine.  Ace-
tylcholine was picked up as a drug if it was spelled 
out, but not if it was abbreviated as ACh and it is 
commonly abbreviated.   
6 Conclusion 
The extraction results indicated that the systems 
tested can be utilized and built upon according to 
user preferences in precision, recall, or specific 
interaction terms.  The corpus presented here offers 
valuable utility to system developers working to-
ward achieving favorable balances of precision and 
recall in gene-drug interaction extractions.  The 
growth of that corpus will also increasingly benefit 
the developers working on those extractions.  That 
type of extraction is important to advancing work 
in pharmacogenomics by retrieving knowledge for 
individuals working in the field.
