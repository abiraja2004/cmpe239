Abstract 
Being confronted with spontaneous 
speech, our current annotation scheme 
requires alterations that would reflect the 
abundant use of non-sentential fragments 
with clausal meaning tightly connected to 
their context, which do not systematically 
occur in written texts. The purpose of this 
paper is to list the common patterns of 
non-sentential fragments and their con-
texts and to find a smooth resolution of 
their semantic annotation.  
1 Introduction 
Spontaneous speech, even assuming a perfect 
ASR, is hard to parse because of the enormous 
occurrence of disfluencies and syntactic devia-
tions. Some disfluencies can be regarded as 
speaker?s errors, which are being corrected or 
remain uncorrected during the speaker?s turn. 
Such disfluencies are e.g.: 
? stammering (We w-went there 
to-together)    
? restart with or without an interregnum 
(John no sorry Jane was 
there, too) 
? repetitions (So you like you 
like drinking) 
? hesitation sounds, long silence, fillers, 
filler phrases, etc. (EH so ... you 
kinda like you know HMM 
drinking)  
In NLP, such disfluencies can be removed be-
fore any syntactic or semantic processing since 
they cause confusion without adding any seman-
tic information. In machine-learning tasks, dis-
fluency is sought to be automatically removed by 
learning from disfluency-marked corpora or cor-
pora of text edits (Haji? et al, 2008; Fitzgerald 
and Jelinek, 2008) to smooth the input text into 
written-language standard before parsing. 
On the other hand, there is another sort of dis-
fluencies, which do not disturb the course of the 
dialog, namely contextual ellipsis: even though 
most people remember being taught at school to 
answer questions with a complete sentence, not 
even educated speakers performing a sophisti-
cated dialog always do so, and yet they do not 
sound incorrect. Clearly, an extensive use of el-
lipsis is an inherent feature of verbal interaction 
between speakers, which is usually smoothly 
perceived by the listener and thus all right in its 
place.  
Such ?fragmentary utterances that do not have 
the form of a full sentence according to most tra-
ditional grammars, but that nevertheless convey 
a complete clausal meaning? are called non-
sentential utterances (NSUs)1. A consistent 
reconstruction of their clausal meaning is inevi-
table for any semantic representation of dialogs. 
The present paper describes a tentative semantic 
representation of NSUs in the Functional Gen-
erative Description (FGD) framework (Sgall et 
al., 1986). 
                                                 
1 The term NSU as well as its definition comes from 
Fern?ndez et al, 2007.

2.1 NSU taxonomy 
Fern?ndez et al (2007) introduce a taxonomy of 
NSUs based on the dialog transcripts from BNC 
(Burnard, 2000). They stress that NSUs are not 
limited to question-answer pairs but can appear 
as responses to any preceding utterance. Our ob-
servations confirm this. NSUs are highly am-
biguous without context. Consider the following 
example:  
A: I left it on the table. 
B: On the table. 
 I confirm/I understand 
what you say: you left it on 
the table. 
A: Where did you leave it? 
B: On the table. 
 I answer your question: I 
left it on the table. 
A: I think I put it er... 
B: On the table. 
 I know in advance what 
you want to say or what you 
would want to say if you 
knew that. 
A: Should I put it back on 
the shelf? 
B: On the table. 
 No, don?t put it back on 
the shelf, but put it on the 
table instead.  
If reconstructed into a complete sentence, the  
NSU would get different shapes in the respective 
contexts (see the paraphrases in italics). 
The NSU taxonomy proposed by Fern?ndez et 
al. (2007) divides the NSUs into 15 classes: 
? Clarification Ellipsis (Two people 
[did you say were there]?) 
? Check Question ([...]Okay?) 
? Reprise Sluice (What[did you say 
]?) 
? Direct Sluice (What?/Who?/When?) 
? Short Answer [to wh-question] (My 
Aunty Peggy.) 
? Plain Affirmative Answer / Rejection 
(Yes. / No.) 
? Repeated Affirmative Answer (Very 
loud, yes.) 
? Helpful Rejection (No, Billy.) 
? Plain Acknowledgement (Mhm.) 
? Repeated Acknowledgement (part of the 
preceding segment repeated) 
? Propositional and Factual Modifiers 
(Probably not. / Oh, 
great!) 
? Bare Modifier Phrase (adjuncts modify-
ing a contextual utterance) 
? Conjunct (fragments introduced by con-
junctions) 
? Filler (fragments filling a gap left by a 
previous unfinished utterance) 
2.2 PhotoPal Dialog Corpora 
Our goal is semantically annotated spoken con-
versations between two speakers over a family 
album. One English corpus (NAP) and one 
Czech corpus have been built within the Com-
panions project (www.companions-project.org) 
as gold-standard data for a machine-learning 
based dialog system (?PhotoPal?) that should be 
able to handle a natural-like conversation with a 
human user, helping to sort the user?s photo-
graphs and encouraging the user to reminisce. 
The PhotoPal is supposed to keep track of the 
mentioned entities as well as to make some in-
ferences. 
The NAP corpus (Bradley et al, 2008) com-
prises about 200k tokens of literal manual tran-
scriptions of audio recordings, which are inter-
linked with a multiple disfluency annotation 
(Cinkov? et al, 2008). The Czech PhotoPal cor-
pus is still growing (Haji? et al, 2009), compris-
ing about 200k tokens at the moment (including 
double annotation).  
 To ease the understanding, all authentic cor-
pus examples will be taken from the English 
NAP corpus.  However, most examples in this 
paper are taken from Fern?ndez et al (2007) and 
modified when needed to illustrate a contrast. 
3 Semantic representation of NAP 
NSUs  
3.1 Functional Generative Description  
The Functional Generative Description (FGD) is 
a stratified formal language description based on 
the structuralist tradition, developed since the 
27
1960?s. The unique contribution of FGD is the 
so-called tectogrammatical representation (TR). 
It is being implemented in a family of semanti-
cally annotated treebanks. 
3.2 Tectogrammatical Representation 
Being conceived as an underlying syntactic rep-
resentation, the TR captures the linguistic mean-
ing of the sentence, which is its basic description 
unit. In the TR annotation, each sentence is rep-
resented as a projective dependency tree with 
nodes and edges. The attribute values include 
references to the analytical (surface-syntax) 
layer. Only content words are represented by 
nodes. Function words are represented as attrib-
ute values. Each node has a semantic label 
(?functor?), which renders the semantic relation 
of the given node to its parent node. The TR an-
notation captures the following aspects of text: 
? syntactic and semantic dependencies 
? argument structure (data interlinked with 
a lexicon) 
? information structure (topic-focus articu-
lation) 
? grammatical and contextual coreference 
? ellipsis restoration. 
Fig. 1 shows a sentence with restored ellipsis. 
The elided predicate in the second conjunct was 
copied from the first conjunct predicate (copied 
and generated nodes have square shape). 
 
  
Fig.1 Mary prepared the lunch, and John [prepared] the 
dinner.  
3.3 Ellipsis Restoration and Contextual 
Coreference 
Assumingly, any tectogrammatical representa-
tion of NSUs is about the most appropriate reso-
lution of contextual ellipsis and coreference. 
TR distinguishes two types of ellipsis: 
? contextual ellipsis, i.e. ellipsis occurring 
when the lexical content of the omitted 
element is clear from the context and 
easily recoverable. The speaker omitted 
this element, since he considered its 
repetition unnecessary. 
? grammatical ellipsis, i.e. such ellipsis 
that occurs when the elided element can-
not appear on the surface for grammati-
cal reasons but is cognitively present in 
the meaning of the utterance (e.g. the 
unexpressed subject of controlled infini-
tives). 
Every occurrence of a given verb must corre-
spond to the appropriate lexicon frame. Any 
obligatory arguments missing must be filled in as 
node substitutes even if the node could be copied 
from the context. The substitutes have special 
lemmas according to their function.  
Fig. 2 illustrates a contextual ellipsis of a de-
pendent node. The tree represents the answer: He 
has [wrapped the book] to the ques-
tion: Has the shop assistant 
wrapped the book? In fact, the tree ren-
ders the sentence He has. To complete the ar-
gument structure frame of the verb wrap, the 
node book with the Patient semantic label is 
inserted into the frame in form of a node with the 
t-lemma substitute for personal pronoun 
(#PersPron, square node) exactly in the 
same way as the expressed he. The node-
constituting lexical verb wrap is copied from the 
previous sentence as a square node while has 
becomes its attribute value, since it is an auxil-
iary verb. The subject He is only converted into 
the #PersPron substitute (with appropriate 
values inside).  
 
 
Fig. 2 He has [wrapped the book].  
 
In the complete TR annotation, a contextual-
coreference arrow would lead from the 
28
#PersPron nodes to their antecedent nodes in 
the previous sentence (to assistant and 
book, respectively). 
3.4 Basic Principles of  NSU Representation 
in TR 
The effort to reconstruct the clausal meaning of 
non-sentential utterances was motivated by the 
following basic assumptions: 
? The text contains utterance-response 
pairs. 
? NSU is the response to an utterance U2. 
? The utterance U has a finite-verb predi-
cate UPred with or without modifiers 
(arguments and adjuncts) UMods, which 
can be assigned functors. 
? Even UPred can be an elided predicate. 
? All NSUs (except interjections but incl. 
plain yes and no) contain an implicit 
(elided) predicate NSUPred. NSUPred is 
either identical with UPred, or it is an 
unknown verb, but we can imagine how 
it relates NSU and U. 
? NSU can be attached to a finite clause. 
? NSU inherits UPred along with all 
UMods. 
? When there is a semantic conflict, 
NSUMods overrule the inherited implicit 
UMods in NSU (repetition is also re-
garded as conflict). 
? NSUMod overrules UMod in the highest 
position possible in the subtree. 
3.5 TR Representation Elements for NSU 
This annotation introduced a new category into 
the annotation scheme. We called the category 
response_type and designed it in the same way as 
the coreference annotation. It is visualized as 
arrows of various colors pointing from NSUMod 
to UMod. Each type is indicated by a different 
color.  
The utterance-response pair consists of two 
parts: the antecedent utterance U and the re-
sponse NSU. The finite verb predicate UPred is 
typically the effective root of U, which has the 
functor PRED, but not necessarily. On the other 
hand, the elided predicate of NSU, called NSU-
                                                 
2 NSU is regarded as a response even if U is a statement and 
NSU a question. 
Pred, is the effective root of NSU and has the 
functor PRED. Fig. 3 describes U in more detail. 
 
 
Fig 3. Utterance-response pair. 
 
Whenever the clausal meaning of NSU can be 
reconstructed by using the copy of UPred as 
predicate, the t-lemma substitute for NSUPred is 
#VerbPron, which is normally also used for 
the pro-form do (dummy-do). NSUPred is al-
ways linked to UPred by a contextual-
coreference arrow. When the clausal meaning of 
NSU cannot be directly reconstructed by using 
the copy of UPred as the predicate, NSUPred is 
rendered as the coreference-less t-lemma substi-
tute #EmpVerb, which is normally used for 
cases of grammatical ellipsis of the predicate. 
#EmpVerb has no obligatory arguments and 
inherits no modifiers from anywhere. An NSU-
Pred that has coreference inherits all modifiers 
from UPred, but these are not explicitly copied to 
NSUPred. NSUPred?s own arguments are re-
garded as added to the inherited modifiers. 
Hence the NSU ?Peggy.? does not have to be 
explicitly reconstructed as ?That is 
Peggy.? (the left figure in Fig.4), but just with 
the coreferential predicate (the right figure).

(left) and the actual annotation resolution (right).
 
29
Obviously, NSUMods can be in a semantic 
conflict with the inherited UMods. These cases 
are marked by several types of arrows leading 
from the given NSUMod to the conflicting 
UMod in the antecedent utterance U. We distin-
guish four types of semantic conflict between 
NSUMod and UMod: 
? overruling 
? rephrasing 
? wh-path 
? other 
3.6  Overruling 
Overruling is the most typical semantic conflict 
where an NSUMod gives exactly the same type 
of information, but relating to a different entity 
in the real world. If NSU is to be expressed as a 
clause that uses the predicate of U, the conflict-
ing UMod is erased (or prevented from inherit-
ing) by the explicitly present NSUMod. E.g. in 
the following utterance-response pair:  
U: I?m in a little place 
called Hellenthorpe. 
NSU: Ellenthorpe.  
NSU-paraphrase: You are in a 
little place called Hellen-
thorpe Ellenthorpe. 
 Even the explicit repetition is regarded as over-
ruling: 
U: There were just two peo-
ple in the class. 
NSU: Two people?.  
NSU-paraphrase: Were there 
just two people two people 
in the class? 
In the tree representation, the crossed text would 
be visible only in the tree of U, and an overrul-
ing-reference arrow would point at them from 
the relevant NSUMod. This conception prevents 
doubling the same modifier in NSU. 
3.7 Rephrasing 
When an NSUMod is rephrasing an UMod, then 
UMod and NSUMod refer to the same entity in 
the real world, or one refers to the entire entity 
whereas the other one refers only to its part, etc., 
using a different wording. The NSUMod-UMod 
relation marked as rephrasing is meant to be-
come the starting material for bridging anaphora 
research. Example:  
U: There were just two peo-
ple in the class. 
NSU: Just two students? 
NSU-paraphrase: Were there 
just two people two students 
in the class? 
It is also applied when the context is unambigu-
ous for the speakers but ambiguous for the anno-
tator, who lacks their background knowledge of 
the given situation. In the following example the 
annotator may not know whether this part 
or just the end of this part should come up, 
because he does not see the speakers pointing at 
the crane, but it is rather evident that it is not a 
completely different part of the crane but some-
thing at the end of it: 
U1: You lift the crane, so 
this part comes up. 
NSU1/U2: The end? 
NSU1/U2-paraphrase1: Do you 
mean the end comes up? 
NSU1/U2-paraphrase2: Do you 
mean the end of this part 
comes up? 
NSU2/U3: Just this. 
NSU3: Okay. 
The category ?Other? (see below) is though 
strongly preferred in ambiguous cases. 
 
3.8 Wh-path3 
The wh-path relation is the relation between the 
modifier that is focused by a wh-word in an U 
that is a direct or indirect question and a NSU-
Mod that makes a good answer.  
Overruling as well as rephrasing assume that 
the conflicting modifiers have the same functor.  
The wh-path category is different from the others 
in that it allows setting in conflict a UMod with 
an NSUMod with different semantic labels 
(functors). Our tentative annotation suggests that 
regular patterns will occur; e.g. with the question 
about direction/location. When asking where, 
speakers often get replies that would actually 
match questions with whom (functor ACMP) 
or with which intention (functor INTT, 
                                                 
3 The term was found in Haji?ov? (1995) and reused 
by placing it in context with other response types. 
30
e.g., go shopping), and yet they are per-
ceived as good answers.  
The relation between an utterance U which is 
a statement and an NSU which is a sluice is not 
wh-path but overruling. Cf.: 
U: Where would you like to 
go tomorrow? 
NSU: Downtown with Mary, to 
do some shopping. (wh-path) 
U: I would like to go down-
town with Mary tomorrow. 
NSU: Where? (overruling) 
Sluices are not regarded as ambiguous in the 
sense whether referring to the same entity as the 
corresponding wh-word or not. They are not eli-
gible for the relation ?other? (see next section). 
3.9 Other 
?Other? is meant for inherently ambiguous cases 
of conflicting UMod and NSUMod where it is 
impossible to decide whether NSUMod is re-
phrasing or overruling UMod. Textual ambiguity 
arises when NSU is a question that does not find 
a proper answer in the context: 
U1: He?s got the best room. 
NSU1/U2: Room 128? 
NSU1/U2-paraphrase: Has he 
got the best room Room 128? 
U3: I don?t know which num-
ber. 
3.10 TR-Conditioned Criteria for NSU types 
The original idea of the tectogrammatical repre-
sentation of NSU was to adopt the taxonomy 
proposed by Fern?ndez et al (2007). However, 
the rules of TR made some classes collapse as 
they yielded identical tectogrammatical tree 
structures. The main criteria for tectogrammati-
cal representation of NSU were the following: 
Is the NSU a phrase or just an interjection? (Cf. 
Fig. 5 and 6) 
? If it is a content word or a phrase, it 
should be reconstructed into a clause by 
adding a predicate. 
? If it is an interjection except yes and no 
(and their colloquial variants), no predi-
cate is added. 
? If it is yes/no (and variants), a predi-
cate should be added.  
? If the interjection acts as a backchannel, 
yes and no make no exception. 
 
Fig. 5 Interjection 
 
 
Fig. 6 Is this John? No, Billy [This is not John, this is Billy.] 
 
 
Can we copy UPred to make NSU a clause?
? If we can, NSUPred has the t-lemma 
substitute #VerbPron and a corefer-
ential arrow points from NSUPred to 
UPred.  
? If we cannot, NSUPred has the t-lemma 
#EmpVerb with no coreferential arrow. 
No response type arrows point from 
NSUMods to UMods. In specific cases 
the coreference to UPred leads from 
elsewhere (Fig.7).

Fig. 7 Check question/Evaluative response related to text: 
U: I am allowed to record you.  
NSU (same speaker): Okay? 
NSU-paraphrase: Is it (that I?m allowed 
to record you) okay?  
or 
U: I am allowed to record you. 
NSU (turn switch): Okay.  
NSU-paraphrase: It <is> okay that you 
are allowed to record me.  
 
3.11 More Examples of U-NSU relation reso-
lution 
Fern?ndez et al (2007) distinguish two types of 
sluice: the direct and the reprise sluice. In TR, 
each has a different semantic representation. The 
direct sluice has the coreferential predicate while 
the reprise sluice, which can be paraphrased as 
What did you mean by saying 
this?,  has the empty-verb predicate and the 
wh-word gets the functor EFF, which is normally 
assigned to what is being said in the argument 
structure pattern of verbs of saying (Fig. 8). 
 
 
Fig. 8 Reprise sluice 
 
Fig. 9 shows a sentence with wh-path linking 
modifiers with different functors. 
 
Fig. 9 Wh-path linking Mods with different functors 
 
U: Where would you like to go tomorrow? 
NSU: Shopping with Mary. 
NSU-paraphrase: Tomorrow I would like to 
go shopping with Mary. 
 
Choice questions (Fig.10) represent an interest-
ing example in which one NSUMod can enter 
different relations to different UMods. The 
NSUMod beer overrules the coordinated UMod 
Coke or Pepsi, and at the same time it is 
connected with the wh-question Which do 
you like to drink? by wh-path. 
 
  
Fig. 10 Choice question.  
 
U: Which do you like to drink: Coke or 
Pepsi? 
NSU: Beer. 
NSU-paraphrase: I like to drink beer. 
 
Seeing the many rephrasing cases in the data, 
which are supposed to be subject to further 
anaphora annotation (bridging etc.), we had to 
ask the question whether the boundary between 
response_type and coreference can be reliably 
determined. We found good evidence in the 
made-up but not unlikely example below (Fig. 
32
11). In this context, him will be coreferential 
with Paul and her will be coreferential with 
Mary. On the other hand, him will overrule 
Mary and her will overrule Paul (only the 
relations of him are marked in the figure).

3.12 Current and Future Work 
The proposed enhancement of the annotation 
scheme has been tested on a corpus of approx. 
200 NSUs with context manually extracted from 
the NAP transcripts as well as on example sen-
tences from Fern?ndez et al (2007) and many 
sentences obtained by their modification per-
formed in order to get potentially difficult coun-
terexamples. As this is still a preparatory work, 
neither the inter-annotator agreement nor any 
other evaluation could be done so far. 
In the next future, parts of the spoken corpora 
should get tectogrammatical parsing. The manual 
annotation is supposed to adopt this new feature 
of the annotation scheme, and we will try to in-
corporate it into our statistically trained auto-
matic parsing tools.  
   
Conclusion 
The confrontation of our current annotation 
scheme with spoken dialog data has raised issues 
of ellipsis restoration and textual coreference in 
non-sentential utterances. We have found com-
mon relations between non-sentential utterances 
and their contexts, and we have integrated them 
into our semantic annotation scheme without 
violating its general principles. A tentative man-
ual annotation of these relations in a small corpus 
suggests that such annotation is feasible. Further 
investigation on larger data along with machine-
learning experiments is intended.
