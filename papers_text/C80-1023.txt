Summary 
A formal grammar accounting for a r t i s t i c  
ab i l i t i es  of a folk story te l le r  is proposed. 
This grammar comprises the following components: 
I) a grammar defining the set of formulae re- 
presenting steps of text  generation; 2) a l i s t  
of "messages" underlying the texts of a fo lk -  
lore genre; 3) a l i s t  of "rules of embellish- 
ment" serving to attach ar t i s t i c  qual i t ies  to 
"messages" and intermediary steps of text 
generation. 
I .  Introduction 
The best way for a researcher to present 
his knowledge of fo lk lore  is to demonstrate 
the ab i l i ty  to construct at least rough approx- 
imations of folk stor ies.  This should be done 
with al l  the techniques accessible to immediate 
observation and checking up. We take the 
standpoint that at the deepest level of a text  
l i e  thematic elements which const itute the 
"message" of the text .  "Rules of Embellish- 
ment" are applied to these elements and attach 
ar t i s t i c  qua l i t ies  to them. The analysis of 
a text  is to be represented as a process of 
generating i t  by "Rules of Embellishment." 
These Rules are analogous to transformations 
in l ingu is t i cs .  They are "message-preserving" 
devices serving to increase the expressive 
power of themes. 
Every rule of embellishment is a part i -  
cular instance of some "pr inc ip le  of expres- 
siveness," from the set of such "pr inc ip les"  
proposed by ?u. Shcheglov and A. Zholkovsky 
( l ingu is ts  and phi lo loqists  who unt i l  recently 
worked in the USSR~ ~ore of the i r  works see 
in the Bibliography in ~. There follows the 
l i s t  of the pr inciples of expressiveness. 
Embodiment (EMBOD) - a subst i tut ion of 
some more concrete and "v iv id"  element X 1 for  a 
more abstract element X. The element X 1 has 
al l  the properties of X plus some new 
feature(s).  
Examples: a man ? a carpenter; a c i ty  ? 
New York; a nose ? a very big nose. 
Amplif ication (AMPLIF) - a subst itut ion 
of an "amplif ied" element X! for a more 
"neutral" element X. The ampli f icat ion may be 
with respect to dimensions, duration, degree, 
etc. 
Examples: deception ? treachery; rape ? 
chi ld-rape; ta lent  ? genius. 
Repetition (REPET) - a subst itut ion of a 
series of nearly identical elements X, X 1 . . . . .  
X n for an element X. 
A FORMAL GRAMMAR OF EXPRESSIVENESS 
FOR SACRED LEGENDS 
F. Dreizin, A. Shenhar, H. Bar-ltzhak 
Haifa University,  Haifa, Israel 
Examples: a door ? the f i r s t  door, the 
second door, the th i rd door . . . .  ; a waiter ? 
the f i r s t  waiter,  the second waiter . . . .  
Variation (VAR) - a subst i tut ion of a 
series of substant ia l ly  d i f fe rent  elements 
X I ,  X 2 . . . . .  X n for an element X so that each 
one is the result  of an EMBOD applied to X. 
Examples: a man ? a carpenter, a student, 
a tax i -d r iver  . . . .  ; a building ? a church, a 
mosque, . . .  
Detai l izat ion (DET) - a subst i tut ion of a 
detai led description Y1 of a thing, s i tuat ion 
or action Y, for Y. 
Examples: X is i l l  ? X stays in bed and 
X has no appetite and X has a high tempera- 
ture; an old Jew dies ? an old Jew i sn ' t  wel l ,  
other Jews come, they pray together, the Rabbi 
comes to v i s i t  the old Jew, the old Jew is dead 
and the body is carried to the cemetery. 
Compare an EMBOD of 'X is i l l '  ? 'X has 
pneumonia' 
Contrast (CONTR) - a subst i tut ion of two 
contrasting elements X and Anti-X for  an 
element ?. 
Examples: death ? perfect health, death; 
treachery ? loyal ty ,  treachery. 
Exposition (EXPO) - a subst itut ion of two 
elements pre-X and X for X, where pre-X pre- 
cedes X in the text ;  pre-X may be: 
a) incomplete X (the shadow of X appears and 
then X i t se l f ) ;  
b) the fe l t  absence of X (everybody is waiting 
for X, then X appears); 
c) Anti-X followed by X. The only difference 
between this case and CONTR is the order of 
Anti-X and X. 
Adjustment (ADJ) - of X to Y with respect 
to a feature f:  X 1 is substituted for X, where 
X 1 has al l  the essential properties of X, plus 
some feature f of an element Y occurring in the 
derivation of a text .  
Examples: touch (X), love (Y); Xl = 
embrace; house (X), many people meet (y); 
X 1 = club. 
Amalgamation (AMALG) - of X with Y - a 
subst i tut ion of an element Z for X and Y where 
Z is the result  of EMBODs applied both to X and 
Y. 
Examples: death (X), love (?); Z = roman- 
t i c  suicide; presence (X), absence (Y), Z = 
a person in disguise. 
Reduction (RED) - a subst itut ion of X 1 for 
X, where X 1 is such a part of X that al l  the 
thematically important information contained 
159 
in X can be restored by means of X I .  
Examples: M. Dayan ? one-eyed Israel i  
Minister;  murder + a blood-stained knife;  
Jewish re l ig ion ? a Torah scro l l ;  communism ? 
The Red Banner. Compare EMBOD: Jewish re l ig ion 
? orthodox Jewish re l ig ion;  communism ? Chinese 
communism. 
I t  seems to us that the most important 
innovations of ShcheglovandZholkovsky are ADJ 
and AMALG. The hypothesis that these pr inc i -  
ples are employed in the construction of 
l i te rary  texts means the presence of intensive 
l inks between text  elements. Let us give a 
simple example of the in tens i f i cat ion  of such 
l inks.  Consider a "theme" 
I .  A person X uses an object Y to in jure 
a person g who uses an object d for aggressive 
purposes. We shall establish l inks between 
some elements of this text.  F i rst ,  we shall 
declare Y and d to be the same object: 
2. A person X uses an object s to injure 
a person g who injures others with this very 
object s. Now we shall establish a l ink be- 
tween g and s. Let 's make s a sort of RED(g): 
3. A person X uses an object s, which is 
used for aggression by g and is inherently 
typical of g, to in jure g. This quasi-text 
has obvious a r t i s t i c  qua l i t ies  and may be 
interpreted, for example, as: 
4. The hero causes the s i tuat ion where 
the Dragon bites i t se l f  with i ts  venomous 
teeth. 
"k "k 
Some applications and specif icat ions of the 
above ideas follow. 
We were looking for the answers to 
questions l ike :  What are creative ab i l i t i es  of 
fo lk lore  s tory - te l le rs?  What are poetic 
systems of d i f fe rent  fo lk lore  genres? As the 
f i r s t  object of our invest igation we have 
chosen sacred legends of Moroccan Jews. 
To make the "Principles of Expressiveness" 
technical ly workable, we represent steps of 
text generations by formulae of a formal 
language devised especial ly for this purpose. 
So analyzing a given text (a legend) - re- 
wr i t ten in our formal language - means con- 
struct ion of a minimal sequence of formulae 
of this language so that: 
I.  The last  formula is an approximation 
of a given text.  
2. One or more formulae of the sequence 
are themes ("messages"). 
3. Every formula Q4, which is not a 
"message", is obtainable with an appli- 
cation of a rule of embellishment 
from one or more formulae Qj, j < i .  
This resembles a proof of a theorem, where 
a "message" is a sort of axiom, Rules of 
Embellishment are rules of inference, and a text 
is a theorem to be proved. By the set of pos- 
sible "messages" and Rules of Embellishment, the 
set of al l  possible texts ( i .e . ,  the genre of 
Moroccan Jewish sacred legends) is given as the 
set of all  provable theorems of our calculus. 
2. Well-Formed Formulae 
We present below a grammar of the context- 
free language defining the set of al l  wel l -  
formed sentences (formulae) used to represent 
steps in the generation of sacred legends. The 
well-formedness is understood as a purely syn- 
tact ica l  feature, 
Rule I .  
<text>?#<t-section>(><t-section>)*# 
Here #~ a terminal boundary symbol, ~ means 
"then", "and af ter  that" ,  * is Kleene's star 
operator; the parentheses are neither terminal 
nor nonterminal symbols, they only mean that 
the sequence ><t-section> is to be repeated as 
a whole, A t -sect ion represents an event. For 
example we may obtain with the Rule I :  
#<t-section> > <t-section> > <t-section># 
Rule 2. 
<t-section> ? <sign>(<t-section>) 
Rule 3. 
<sign> ? + I -  I = I ~ 
The sign + marks an event which is good for the 
Jews; the sign - marks an event which is bad for 
the Jews; the sign = marks an event which is 
par t i cu la r ly  bad for  the Jews; an event with 
is neither bad nor good for the Jews, but 
implies a hope or a poss ib i l i ty  for the good, 
Rule 4. 
<t-section> ? (<t-section>(~<t-section>)*) 
Here the inner pair of parentheses is used as in 
Rule I .  The siqn ~ is used to say that two or 
more events are amalgamated:(a~b) is one event 
which is an AMALG for two events a and b; ~Qb~c) 
means that three events, a,b, and c are amal- 
gamated into one, etc. More about the amalga- 
mation of events w i l l  be said below. 
Rule 5. 
<t-section> ? STAT(<t-section>) 
The operator STAT can make any event into a 
"stat ive"  event. A stat ive event is,  in a way, 
timeless. STAT makes a last ing s i tuat ion out 
of an event. For example, STAT(x loses y) may 
mean "x has lost y" ,  or else "x would usually 
lose y".  
An action in the scope of STAT loses in 
part i ts  usual consequences (a crime against 
the Jews performed under STAT is not punished, 
for example). Protagonists involved in actions 
under STAT may be more general than outside the 
160 
scope of STAT (Jewish community vs a Jew, for 
example). That is ,  a term in the scope of STAT 
may not undergo an EMBOD affect ing i t s  occur- 
ences in the rest of the formula. 
Rule 6. 
<t-section> + STEP(<t-section>) 
The operator STEP makes a part ia l  event from a 
complete one. For example, STEP(x comes) may 
be understood as "x knocks at the door", or 
else "x is seen through the window", etc. In 
this case, STEP(STEP(x comes)) may be under- 
stood as "x is unclearly (or par t ia l l y )  seen 
through the window". 
Rule 7. 
<t-section> ? QUASl(<t-section>) 
The operator QUASI is used to designate a sym- 
bol ic  or r i tua l  counterpart of an event. For 
example, QUASl (The army occupies the c i ty)  may 
be "The army leader receives the keys of the 
c i ty" .  
Rule 8. 
<t-section> ? <adverb>(<t-section>) 
Rule 9. 
<adverb> ? MIR I ANTI I NOT 
MIR means "miraculously";  ANTI means "opposite 
to . . . " ;  NOT may be understood as negation. 
Rule I0. 
<t-section> ? <predicate expression>(&<predi- 
cate expression>) 
A more complex event is represented as an un- 
ordered set of simpler events. 
Rule I I .  
<predicate expression> + <sign>(<predicate 
expression>) 
Rule 12. 
<predicate expression> ? <adverb>(<predicate 
expression>)

DISTRESSED(x) is a state or an event which 
is bad for x with respect to material ,  moral or 
physical conditions. PROSELYTIZED (x) means 
that x imposes on himself, par t ia l l y  or com- 
p lete ly ,  the laws of the Jewish re l ig ion ,  
GUILTY(x) is a state of x which is punishable 
by the author i t ies  for an offence against them. 
USE (x,y) is a typ ica l ,  normal re lat ion between 
human x and a thing y, y being conceived ex- 
c lus ive ly  as a means of x's wel l -being. The 
exact nature of th is  re lat ion depends on x and 
y. For example, x beinq a community and y 
sa int 's  shrine, USE becomesvisit ingandpraylng, 
asking for help, being cured, etc. INJURE(x,y) 
is x's doing any harm to y. CAUSE (A,B) means: 
the event A happens and involves the event B. 
RESTORE (x,y) means l iqu idat ion  of the conse- 
quences of x's in jur ing y. DISABLE and PETRIFY 
are two forms of paralysis ,  the f i r s t  one par- 
t ia l ,  the second one complete. INATTACK (x,y) 
is involuntary in jur ing y by x. CANCELED (A) 
means: a l l  the consequences of the event A 
become non-existent.  MAKESEE (x,y) means that 
x causes the bl ind y to see. 
Rule 14. 
> < 
The symbol over a term may be rewritten 
as ~ - ~,~_mean For a term x the ex- 
pressions T, respect iyely,  that the 
occurrence of a predicate, with x, ~, x f i l l -  
ing up a s lo t ,  is bad for x, good for x, or 
involves a hope for the good for x. > < may 
also be omitted. 
This rule can be easi ly rewritten in a context- 
free form, without d iacr i t i ca l  marks and the 
poss ib i l i ty  of a mark delet ion.  (A change in 
the Rule 13 is also needed.) 
Rule 15. 
<term> ? <variable feature>(~<feature>)*l 
<feature>(,<feature>) 
The aster isk occurring between features is a 
terminal symbol and should not be confused with 
Kleene's star operator.

SYMBOL is an important object which has some 
ideological value for a community. VALOBJ is a 
valuable object without ideological importance. 
J means Jewish. A means Arabic. SP is an ob- 
ject possessing sacred power. CON means commun- 
i ty .  VERIMP means a very important person. 
RELA is rel igious authority. SECA is secular 
authority. TROUBLED means in trouble. HYPOCRITE 
means "pretending to be a friend of the Jews". 
ITZHAK and PINTO are proper names of typical 
Jewish rabbis.

Rule 20. 
<negative feature> ? #(<simple feature>(,<simple 
feature>)*) 
A term including a negative feature is char- 
acterized by the negation of at least one simple 
feature included in the given negative feature. 
A term corresponds, generally, to an object 
characterized by the conjunction of the non- 
negative features which i t  is composed of. For 
example, 
MALE*SINGLE,SHEPHERD*#(RICH*ILL) 
means: 
"A (male) shepherd who is either not rich or 
not i l l ,  or else is neither rich nor i l l " .  
3. The Messages 
I. # -(DISTRESSED(J*~)) ~ +(ACTION(J*RELA))> 
+(ANTI(DISTRESSED(J*~)))# 
2. # -(INJURE(HUMAN*A,J)) ~ +(MIR(PROTECT 
@,SP ,~) ) ) # 
3. # -(INJURE(HUMAN,Aj)) ~ +(HIP(REVENGE 
(J*SP,HUMAN*A)))# 
4. # -(INJURE(HUMAN*A,J)) > +(HIP(REVENGE 
(J,SP,FFOI~TAN,~))) > +(RESPECT(A,~)) > +(MIR 
(RESTORE(J,SP,~)))# 
The well-formedness of the above four 
messages can be easily veri f ied. Using the 
informal semantics given above with the formal 
syntactical rules of our language, we can read, 
for example, the second message approximately 
as follows: 
"A human Arab agent (HUMAN,A) injures a Jewish 
object (J), which is bad for the Jews (the 
event is marked by minus), and after that (>) a 
Jewish bearer of Sacred Power (J*SP) miracu- 
lously (MIR) protects the (above) Jewish object, 
which is good for the Jews (marked by plus)." 
The above messages can be developed into 
separate stories. But a subset of them can be 
also "amalgamated" to a single story by the 
appropriate rule of embellishment. 
4. The "Rules of Embellishment." 
These rules are the central part of our 
grammar. There are many of them; we cannot 
present here more than several typical examples 
taken from our technical reports(see 2).The set 
of possible objects (protagonists and things) 
of the legends is described in 2 by a network 
grammar: a possible object is an unordered set 
of features picked up from the arcs of the net- 
work by moving from the in i t ia l  state to a final 
state. Asterisks are inserted between the 
features. Examples: the term HUMAN,SINGLE, 
VERIMP,RELA*J*SP*MALE can be understood as "A 
Jewish Saint"; the term THING*SINGLE*SYMBOL*A* 
GRAVE(HUMAN*SINGLE*VERIMP*RELA*A*MALE*KADI) can 
be read as "the grave of an Arab Kadi." 
The same network serves to EMBOD terms: to any 
set of features which belong to a path in the 
network we may add any set of features which 
belong to the same path. So, for example, 
HUMAN,GROUP ? HUMAN,GROUP,A,SIMPLE,MALE 
("people" ? "some Arabs") 
is a rule of embodiment for terms by virtue of 
the fact that there is a path in the network to 
which both the left-hand set of features and 
the right-hand set belonq (see the network in 
2 pp. 15-18; the report 2 is to be d i s t r i -  
buted among the participants of COLING-80). 
NB: Any rule of embodiment, when chosen, 
is to be applied to every occurrence of the 
expression I for  exampie, the term) which is to 
be substituted for. There are complications, 
for example, with EMBOD of RESPECT, but we shall 
not deal with them here. 
By a rule of such kind we can obtain, for 
example, from the second message the following 
formula: 
# -(INJURE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP,SlMPLE*J)) > +(MIR 
(PROTECT(J*SP,SIMPLE*J)))#. 
The following rule is an example of EMBOD 
for predicate expressions: 
INJURE(HUMAN,A, HUM~)  ? MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN, 
~, PROPERTY(HUMAN*J)). 
The appl icab i l i ty  of such rules is con- 
ceived so as to make possible the application 
of this rule to the above formula (cf. 2 ,  pp. 
29-32), with the following result :  
-162 
#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY 
(SIMPLE*HUMAN a))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, 
S IMPLE*J) ) ) #. 
The feature HUMAN (which is ,  in our grammar, 
predictable by the feature SIMPLE) can be in- 
troduced to the last term by obligatory ADJ 
to SIMPLE*HUMAN,J (which is considered an 
immediate descendant of SIMPLE,J), with the 
result:  
#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN,A,VERIMP, PROPERTY 
(SIMPLE,HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, 
SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#. 
So the ident i ty  of the Jewish protagonist is 
restored, Now we can amalgamate the above 
formula with the third message. This is the 
simplest case of AMALG: the two chains of 
events are mixed up to produce one chain 
comprising al l  the events. This is done under 
control of the (thematic) principle prescribing 
that al l  "minus-events" precede all  "plus- 
events": 
#-(INJURE(HUMAN*A,J)) ~ -(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN* 
A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR 
(REVENGE(J,SP, HUM~)) )  > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, 
SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#. 
Now, we do not need two di f ferent v i l l a ins .  
One v i l l a in  wi l l  do: we can polish the formula 
by ADJ of the term HUMAN,A to the term HUMAN,A, 
VERIMP. This optional adjustment is a specific 
case of EMBOD: an expression is EMBODed so as 
to become similar (in the l im i t  case-identical) 
to another expression of the operand formula. 
So we obtain: 
#-(INJURE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP,J)) ~ -(MISAPPROPRIATE 
(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) 
+(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP, HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) ~ +(MIR 
(PROTECT(J*SP, SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#. 
The term J of the f i r s t  t-section can 
underqo an analoqous operation, and now we 
shall have only one Jewish protagonist in the 
story (a "SIMPLE" one): 
#-(INJURE(HUMAN,A,VERIMP, J,SIMPLE*HUMAN)) > 
-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY 
(SIMPLE,HUMAN,J))) > +(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP, 
HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J,SP, SIMPLE* 
HUMAN*J)))#. 
Two di f ferent acts of '~njuring" can be 
amalgamated to one by the followin 9 rule: two 
dif ferent t-sections X and Y such that Y can be 
obtained from X by rules of EMBOD, can be amal- 
gamated by dropping X. Now Y serves to 
represent both X and i t se l f .  By applying this 
rule to the above formula, we obtain: 
#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN,A, VERIMP,PROPERTY 
(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR(REVENGE(J,SP, 
HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, SIMPLE, 
HUM~)))#. 
Now, one can amalgamate the SP's acts of 
revenge and protection, with the result:  
#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(TIUMAN,A*VERIMP, PROPERTY 
(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) ~ +(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP, 
HUMAN*A*VERIMP)) ~ MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, S'iMPLE* 
HUMAN*J)))#. 
This formula can be read as follows: 
"A human Arab agent belonging to the highest 
social stratum misappropriates a property of a 
Jewish person of low status. After that an 
event occurs which is at the same time an act 
of Jewish Saint's revenge with respect to the 
Arab, and an act of this Saint's protection 
with respect to the Jew." 
This story s t i l l  needs an interpretat ion, 
but we think that even at this stage the above 
text possesses some ar t i s t i c  potential accumu- 
lated in the process of i ts  derivation from the 
themes (messages). A rough interpretation of 
this text could run as follows: 
"The Sheik misappropriates a valuable 
thing belonging to a Jewish shoemaker (or 
carpet-maker), and the Rabbi causes this thing 
to return miraculously to i ts  legal possessor 
In a way which damages the Sheik." 
A more delicate interpretation can give 
us something l ike:  " . . . the  misappropriated 
carpet (in the case of a carpet-maker, with an 
appropriate ADJ) miraculously returns to i ts  
possessor carrying the frightened Sheik on i t . "  
Or else: 
" . . .  the misappropriatedpair of shoes (in the 
case of a shoemaker, with an appropriate ADJ) 
miraculously returns to i t s  possessor carrying 
the Sheik wearing them." 
Such interpretations are beyond the 
capabi l i t ies of our grammar, but (we hope) not 
far beyond the capabi l i t ies of grammars of 
the kind proposed. 
Interpretations for simpler cases of 
AMALG for events are easily achievable techni- 
cal ly,  for example: 
(INJURE(A,J) ~ INJURE(HAWKER,SHEPHERD)) ? 
INJURE(A,HAWKER,J,SHEPHERD), etc. 
Amalgamated events are usually good for the Jews. 
Events which happen to be good for the Arabs 
are simple, t r i v ia l .  Let us take now one more 
example, rather typical for our material: 
. . .  ~ +(INJURE(SP, SIMPLE*A)) > +(INJURE(SP, 
VERIMP*A)) > .. .  
--163-- 
Amalgamating injur ies with two di f ferent 
persons injured is a typical a r t i s t i c  device 
in Moroccan Jewish sacred legends. At present, 
we only assume the "intention" of a story- 
te l le r  (or a story author) to amalgamate 
the above events: 
. . .  ~ +(INJURE(SP,SlMPLE,A) ~ INJURE(SP, 
VERIMP,A)) > .. .  
Now, how is this aim achieved? Typical 
Jewish legend uses a technical i ty which may 
be called Deposite. Deposite is a thing or 
a person related to authorit ies but temporarily 
under the responsibi l i ty of a "simple" person. 
Injuring a deposite means injuring both the 
"simple" person and the "very important" 
person involved. In the story analyzed in 2 
the deposite is the Sheik's son. In another 
story the role of a deposite is played by a 
g i f t  (of a group of "simple" Arabs to the 
Sheik). 
The amalgamated character of SP actions 
is so typical of our legends that i t  may be 
conceived as nearly thematical. In general, 
an optional a r t i s t i c  device can move to the 
thematic sphere and become obligatory. I t  is 
nearly so in the case under discussion where 
the amalgamation around an SP action is 
preferable, though a concrete real ization of 
the operator~leaves considerable freedom to 
a s tory- te l ler .  
There follow more examples of rules of 
embellishment. 
#s(a)>+ #s(STAT(s(a))) 
Here s is a sign. This rule serves to turn 
the opening event of a story to the exposition, 
a standing situation which is to become the 
background for the rest of events. 
>s(a)# ?~s(STAT(s (a ) ) )# 
This is an analogous rule for the transformation 
of the last event to the coda, the epilogue of 
a story. 
There follow two rules for EMBOD of STEP: 
STEP(a) ? QUASI(a) 
s(STEP(s(a I &a 2&. . .  &ak))) + s (a i ) ( i= l ,  
or i=2 . . . . .  or i=k) 
The last  rule is a way to EMBOD an EXPO 
for a set of events: an event from the set 
occurs. 
Now we shall present a rule of EXPO (which 
exists in three di f ferent forms): 
>-(T) >4> - (TRY( - t - , - (T ) ) )>- (T )  
#-(T) >+# - (TRY( -{ - , - (T ) ) )>- (T )  
>+(T) >?> - (TRY( ' t - ,+(T)) )> ,(T) 
TAe above rule works for a t-section T 
where t appears in the f i r s t  place of the high- 
est predicate of T which does not appear 
immediately after ANTI or NOT; otherwise Y 
should appear in the f i r s t  place of the highest 
predicate. 
Example: the expression 
. . .  ~ +(ANTI(DISTRESSED(HUM~)))~ . . .  
can be transformed by the above rule to 
. . .  ~ ~(TRY(ROMAN~J,+(ANTI(DISTRESSED(HUM~))))) 
+(ANTI(DISTRESSED(FF~-)))> . . .  
An example of AMPLIF (or CONTR, or rather 
AMPLIF by CONTR): 
-(PROHIBIT(A,+(P(t I)))) ~ + >-(PROHIBIT(A,+ 
(P( t l ) ) ) )~ -(P(a))~ 
Here P(t l )  is a predicate expression with a 
term ~I in i ts  f i r s t  place (or the only place). 
The t-section P(A) is obtained by substituting 
the term corresponding to A (an a~ab_agent) 
for t I in P(t),  and changing any t i l t  I to t i .  
This is an AMPLIF for prohibit ion: an Arab 
agent not only prohibits t ' s  doing P, but 
does P himself (or herself). Example: 
. . .  > -(PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP,+(USE(SIMPLE*J, 
J*SYMBOL))))~...+ ...>-(PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP, 
+(USE(SIMPLE*J,J*SYMBOL)))) > -(USE(A,VERIMP, 
J*SYMBOL))p .. ,  
The principle of CONTR is exemplified also 
by the following rule: 
s(TRY(-t-,T)) ? s(TR?(-t-,T)) > FAIL(t,T), 
where s is a sign, t is a term and T is a t-  
section. 
Many other rules of embellishment, amon~ 
them some more sophisticated ones, see in 2 
Some transformations, which we call Formal 
Equivalences, do not contribute to expressive- 
ness, but serve only to improve readabil i ty of 
a formula and to fac i l i ta te  implementation of 
the Rules of Embellishment. There are rules 
eliminating adverbial expressions: 
so(ANTI(si(ABASE(tl,t2)))) ? So(PRAISE(tl,t2)) 
or el se 
so(ANTl(sl(DISaBkE(tl,t2)))) + so(CURE(tl,t2)); 
there are rules dealing with signs: 
NOT(-(T)) ? +(NOT(-(T))) 
or el se 
So(So(T) ) ? So(T), and many others. 
Here s o and s I are signs, t I and t 2 are terms, 
and T is a t-section. 
5. The Final Example. 
We present below a typical Moroccan Jewish 
sacred legend - the text and the final step of 
a rather lengthy derivation representing an 
analysis of the legend in our grammar. This 
is a very rough approximation of the Text. The 
-164 
derivation see in 2 The formula is obtained 
from the "messages" i and 4. 
HOW A HOLY JEWISH TOMB WAS DISCOVERED 
Once the Arabs of Teluat near Marrakesh 
bui l t  a fence around their graveyard. In this 
graveyard was buried a great and learned rabbi. 
The Arabs did not know of this, for in the 
village in which the graveyard was situated 
there were only Arabs, and no Jews at a l l .  
One night one of the women of the village 
dreamed that a man dressed in a long white 
shirt and with a long white beard came to 
her. He said to the woman: "In the morning 
inform the men of the burial society of the 
Jews in the neighbouring town that their 
rabbi, who is buried in the Moslem graveyard 
in the vil lage, has no peace." 
" I r i s  just a dream," said the woman to 
herself. But the dream was repeated. Again 
the woman said: " I t  is just a dream." But 
when the dream was repeated for the third time, 
she knew that the dream spoke truly to her. 
On the following day she went to the town to 
tel l  about her dream. 
Themen of the burial society came to 
the sheik of Tthe village and said to him: 
"Our,~rabbi is buried in yQur graveyard. Permit 
us to seek outthe place. We shall pay you 
much money i f  you wil l  allow us to build over 
the grave a place for prayer." 
"Good," the sheik agreed. 
The men Of the burial society sought 
and sought but they found nothing. The son 
~ ' the  sheik began to get angry and began to 
durse them and &ay: "What are you looking for 
~pre? A rabbiwwho died a hundred years ago? " 
He turned aside to,,ease himself b~tHe fence, 
and then suddenly he stood like-a stone, 
paralysed. 
When the men of the burial society who 
were already getting ready to go back to the 
town saw the sheik's son standing like:a stone 
statue, they understood: Here was the grave 
of the rabbi. 
The Arabs asked: "What shall we do with, 
the sheik's son? The sheik wil l  k i l l  us i f  ,- 
he hears that his son has become paralysed."" 
"Break down the fence!" the men of the 
burial society commanded. And straight away 
the Arabs broke down the fence. 
Then they drew a circle about the spot 
where the sheik's son was standing,,took 
stones and wrote upon i t  "A holy ~e~i,sh grave". 
Then the sheik's son began to move,~is limbs 
and move from the place. "Where am I?" he 
asked. "What has happened to me?" 
They told him everything and then he said: 
" I f  that is the case then your rabbi is indeed 
great." 
The Arabs erected a monument on the grave, 
and every year the Jews came there to celebrate 
the Rabbi's birthday. 
See Dov Noy 3 , pp. 42-43. The last few lines 
are an addition from the Hebrew version of the 
legend.

We shall informally describe some ar t i s t i c  
features of this legend which we tr ied to 
account for by our analysis. 
The discovery of the holy grave is preceded 
by attempts to f ind i t .  This is not a simple 
repetit ion which is characterist ic of fa i ry 
tales ( " . . .  tr ied once and did not succeed, 
tr ied the second time and did not succeed, 
tr ied the th ird time and succeeded..."). In 
our legend the fa i lure  is to be taken more 
seriously: the Jews acknowledged the defeat 
and were ready to leave the graveyard. A 
professional story wr i ter  (for example, a 
detective story writer)  would not ignore such 
a device: the detective t r ies  to find the 
decisive evidence, admits his fa i lure  (for 
example, cal ls  to the police off ice: "Nothing 
o f  interest!")  and then - by accident - finds 
the desired object. In our story, too, the 
discovery is accidental. I t  does not result 
from any additional ef fort  by the Jews. More 
than that, i t  is caused by a hosti le action. 
The punitive action by SP (the Sheik's son 
being petr i f ied)  creates a knot of entangled 
events; in fact, one event which comprises 
di f ferent actions. The petr i f i cat ion is ,  at 
the same time, the discovery of the holy grave 
by the Jews (no separate action of f inding is 
involved). The petr i f i cat ion means that the 
Jews have found the holy grave, Tt is a sign 
of the holy grave being here. More than that: 
the Sheik's son being pet~ied  means danger 
for the group of Arabs who are responsible for 
his peaceful return home. The Arab community 
is punished by endangering a representative 
group of Arabs ( "o f f i c ia l s " ) .  The last compo- 
nent of the complex event under consideration 
is the Sheik's son's being turned to a sort 
of stone, a sort of statue. The symbolic 
significance of this act was recognized not 
only by us but also by some students, including 
those of Moroccan Jewish or ig in:  petr i fy ing 
the Sheik's son is a symbolic counterpart of 
erecting a monument on the holy grave. The 
Sheik's son is forced to erect a sort of 
monument with his own body. Thus an action 
which is to be performed by the Jewish com- 
munity is in fact performed (in symbolic form) 
by a hosti le agent. This is a manifestation 
of a pr inciple which the whole story is per- 
meated with: plus-actions are regularly per- 
formed by the potential or actual enemy - the 
Arabs. The Rabbi appears in the dream to an 
Arab woman. I t  is up to her to inform the 
Jewish community of the problem which has ar i -  
senl. The symbolic monument is f i r s t  erected 
with the Sheik's son's body. The Arabs them- 
selves destroy the wall around the cemetery, 
not just permitting the Jews to do so. The 
Arabs encircle the holy grave, to designate 
i ts  exter r i to r ia l i ty  in the Arab graveyard. 
They then erect a temporary monument with some 
stones. F inal ly ,  the Arabs build the proper 
monument.
