ABSTRACT 
Two auditory front ends which emulate some aspects of the human 
auditory system were compared using a high performance isolated 
word Hidden Markov Model (HMM) speech recognizer. In these 
initial studies, auditory models from Seneff \[2\] and Ghitza \[4\] 
were compared using both clean speech and speech corrupted by 
speech-like "babble" noise. Preliminary results indicate that the 
auditory models reduce the error ate slightly, especially at inter- 
mediate and high noise levels. 
1. MOTIVATION 
The performance of speech recognizers often degrades dra- 
matically in noise, with different alking styles, when the 
microphone is changed, and as a talker moves relative to a 
microphone. New auditory front ends that mimic some 
aspects of human auditory-nerve and psychoacoustic 
behavior have been proposed to reduce these problems. 
Although past limited experiments suggest that these front 
ends improve robustness, no thorough comparisons have 
been performed using high-performance Hidden Markov 
Model (HMM) recognizers. In addition, few studies have 
evaluated the effect of speech babble noise and frequency 
response variability on performance orexplored alternative 
approaches to feature reduction. This is an early progress 
report on research in this area. Further ongoing experiments 
are exploring additional front ends and alternative data 
reduction techniques. 
2. AUDITORY MODELS 
Two auditory front ends which produce features that corre- 
spond to phase or synchrony information i  the speech sig- 
nal were explored. These auditory front ends were 
compared to a more conventional reel-scale cepstral front 
end.

2.1. Mel-Scale Cepstra 
The reel-scale cepstral front end described by Davis and 
Mermelstein \[1\] was used as a reference. This is a common 
signal representation which is currently used in all speech 
recognition systems at Lincoln Laboratory. In this front 
end, a 20 ms Hamming window is applied to the speech 
signal every 10 ms. The power spectrum of the windowed 
waveform is weighted by a series of filters, linearly spaced 
from 0 to 1000 Hz, and logarithmically spaced above 1000 
Hz. Each filter "width" is twice the spacing. An inverse 
cosine transform converts the logarithm of the resulting fil- 
ter bank coefficients o the cepstral domain. 
2.2. Seneff's Auditory Model 
The first auditory front end evaluated was motivated from 
physiological data and described by Seneff \[2,3\]. This front 
end incorporates a first stage of 40 linear filters, followed 
by a series of nonlinearities modelling the transformation 
from basilar membrane motion to auditory nerve stimula- 
tion. Such nonlinearities include soft half-wave rectifica- 
tion, a model for short-term adaptation, and a rapid AGC. 
Seneff's front end had two outputs. "Mean rate" outputs are 
generated by detecting the envelope of the nonlinear stage 
output. These outputs roughly corresponds tospectral mag- 
nitude information. "Synchrony" outputs detect he extent 
that the nonlinear stage output for a particular channel has 
energy at the center frequency for that channel. This emu- 
lates the extent o which the nerve firings from a particular 
location of the basilar membrane are synchronized to the 
"characteristic frequency" corresponding tothat location. 
2.3. EIH 
The second auditory front end evaluated was the Ensemble 
Interval Histogram (EIH) model developed by Ghitza \[4\]. 
The EIH model has a first stage of linear filters similar to 
Seneff's, but with a considerably higher number of filters 
(133 instead of 40). The second stage takes the output of 
each filter and computes the intervals between the positive 
crossings of the filtered waveform at various logarithmi- 
453 
cally spaced thresholds. A histogram of the frequencies cor- 
responding to these intervals is then created. The final stage 
combines the histograms for each of the channels together 
into the; final output, the Ensemble Interval Histogram. In 
this respect, the EIH model performs functions imilar to 
Seneff's "Synchrony" output; measuring the extent hat the 
output of the linear filter is in synchrony with the center fre- 
quency of that filter. The EIH model has been shown useful 
in performing isolated-word recognition i  high noise con- 
ditions. 
3. EVALUATION CONDIT IONS 
Initial evaluation is being performed using the TI-105 word 
speech corpus. \[5\] This corpus includes peech spoken in 
various taking styles, includes 8 speakers, (5 male and 3 
female) and provides 5 training tokens and 2 testing tokens 
per condition for each vocabulary item. 
Noise was added to the clean speech condition to evaluate 
performance under noisy channel conditions. Noise was 
speech babble recorded in a public meeting place with 
many background speakers. For this evaluation we used 
Ghitza's definition of signal to noise ratio \[4\] as the ratio of 
the energy per speech sample in the clean speech and the 
noise averaged over the entire duration of the utterance. 
The recognition system was a word-based HMM system 
with eight speech states per word model, continuous den- 
sity observations and a single tied diagonal covariance 
matrix for every state. This robust recognizer provides low 
error rates on many isolated-word databases. 
Both auditory front ends produce high-dimensional feature 
vector outputs. For classification, the dimensionality was 
reduced using the same inverse cosine transform used for 
the reel-scale cepstral front end. For these purposes, all 
auditory model outputs were treated as representing spec- 
tral magnitude. This was done in lieu of a more advanced 
data reduction technique such as principal components 
analysis or linear discriminant analysis. 
4. RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the results of the preliminary recognition 
experiments. The signal to noise ratio is indicated in the 
first column, followed by the word accuracy results for the 
reel-frequency epstra, (MFC) the "mean rate" response 
and "synchrony" output (SYN) from Seneff's auditory 
model, and the results using the EIH model. The binomial 
standard eviation of the word accuracy rate assuming the 
MFC performance l vel is indicated in the final column. 
These preliminary results are encouraging. There is no deg- 
radation in performance at low noise levels, and all front- 
ends provide reduced error rates at both intermediate and 
high noise levels.

5. FUTURE WORK 
These results are preliminary, and more experiments are 
planned to further investigate the effect of these and other 
signal representations on the performance of speech recog- 
nition systems. These include: 
1. Evaluation of additional signal representations 
2. Exploration of data reduction techniques such as 
principle components analysis and linear discrimi- 
nant analysis 
3. Exploration of techniques such as the combined use 
of Seneff's "mean rate" and "synchrony" outputs 
4. Evaluation of auditory models on continuous speech
