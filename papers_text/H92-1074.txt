ABSTRACT 
The CSR (Connected Speech Recognition) corpus represents a 
new DARPA speech recognition technology development i i ia- 
tive to advance the state of the art in CSR. This corpus essentially 
supersedes the now old Resource Management (RM) corpus that 
has fueled DARPA speech recognition technology development 
for the past 5 years. The new CSR corpus supports research on
major new problems including unlimited vocabulary, natural 
grammar, and spontaneous speech. This paper presents an over- 
view of the CSR corpus, reviews the definition and development 
of the "CSR pilot corpus", and examines the dynamic challenge of 
extending the CSR corpus to meet future needs. 
OVERVIEW 
Common speech corpus development and evaluation 
received major emphasis from the very beginning of the 
DARPA speech recognition program. At that ime, a set of 
common corpora were defined to serve the needs of the 
research community. This resulted in the development of
the TIMIT speech corpus, which was collected from a large 
number of subjects and intended to support basic research 
in acoustic-phonetic re ognition technology. The Resource 
Management (RM) corpus, collected from fewer subjects 
but representing an application of interest to DARPA, pro- 
vided the greatest focus of interest in technology through- 
out the research community. In the course of R&D using 
these two corpora, the first serious research and advances 
toward speaker-independent speech recognition were 
achieved. 
Although the RM corpus erved its intended purpose well, 
technology advances came to make its limitations painfully 
obvious. The language was artificial and limited, the speech 
was read and therefore unnatural, and the corpus com- 
pletely avoided the central issue of understanding the 
meaning of the spoken utterances. In response to these lim- 
itations and to rapid advances in the performance ofspeech 
recognition technology on this RM task, a new research ini- 
tiative was formed by combining speech recognition and 
natural language understanding tasks in a spoken language 
system (SLS) program. 
The SLS program took shape with the definition of the Air- 
line Travel Information System (ATIS) task, a database 
query task which supports research in both speech recogni- 
tion and natural language. The ATIS corpus (corpora) is 
currently being collected to provide the experimental data 
for developing SLS technology. This ATIS corpus exhibits 
several desirable features regarding the speech recognition 
problem that were found lacking in the RM corpus. These 
features are namely the use of spontaneous goal-directed 
speech and the consequent use of a natural grammar and an 
open unrestricted vocabulary. 
Although the ATIS corpus provides the kind of speech data 
desired by the speech recognition research community and 
required to address important problems in the application 
of speech recognition to real tasks, there is one unfortunate 
shortcoming ofthis corpus. This is that he cost and effort 
of collecting the data is too great o support the massive 
data requirements for advances in speech recognition tech- 
nology. Some way of improving the efficiency and produc- 
tivity of data collection was needed in order to support 
further advances in speech recognition technology. This 
need was the primary motivation for the creation of the 
CSR research initiative and its related CSR corpus. 
The CSR research initiative, along with the CSR corpus 
development effort, was created in order to provide better 
support for advances in the state of the art in large vocabu- 
laiy CSR. The primary focus in the CSR initiative has been 
on the design and development ofa CSR speech corpus 
which is required to fuel the research and through which 
the research might be productively directed. Primary objec- 
tives of the CSR corpus have been to increase the realism 
of the speech data and at the same time to maximize the 
efficiency of collecting that data. Efficiency has been 
viewed as of paramount importance because it is generally 
believed that significant advances in speech recognition 
technology will require more comprehensive models of 
speech and correspondingly more massive quantities of 
speech data with which to train them. 
Janet Baker was the principal champion and designer of the 
CSR corpus, working as the chair of a CSR corpus design 
committee. This committee dealt with a large and diverse 
set of research interests and corpus needs, which made the 
363 
task of designing a satisfactory corpus extremely difficult. 
For example, the desire to collect spontaneous speech was 
in direct opposition to the need to make corpus develop- 
ment efficient (because spontaneous speech requires a gen- 
erally painstaking and expensive transcription task, 
whereas read speech can be transcribed far more efficiently 
and even largely automatically). 1 
Major Corpus Design Decisions 
Read speech versus pontaneous speech: On the 
issue of spontaneous speech, it was decided that the 
majority of the corpus (and in particular the majority 
of the training data) should be read speech, for eco- 
nomic reasons, whereas the majority of the test data 
(which comprises a small fraction of the total data) 
should be spontaneous speech. The reason for these 
decisions i  that it was felt that large amounts of read 
speech would provide greater training benefits than 
smaller amounts of spontaneous speech, while using 
spontaneous speech for testing would better validate 
the technology for a relatively small increase in cost. 
Prompting text: Probably the most significant deci- 
sion regarding the CSR corpus was the decision to 
work initially with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). 
This decision was influenced by the richness of the 
WSJ language and by the existence of a preexisting 
and very large (50 million word) corpus of WSJ text 
(as part of the ACL-DCI effort). All of the read 
speech data is currently being collected using 
prompts derived from the WSJ. The spontaneous 
speech data is being collected using a news reporting 
dictation paradigm that simulates the WSJ dictation 
scenario. 2 
Verbalized punctuation: In dictation, which is the 
nominal target application for the CSR technology 
development effort, dictation users typically say 
punctuation such as "comma" and "period" so as to 
aid in the proper punctuation ofthe dictated ocu- 
ment. Therefore, in order to improve the verisimili- 
tude of the CSR corpus, a strong opinion was voiced 
that such verbalized punctuation (VP) be included in 
the prompting text. Opposed to this view was the

in detail in the paper by D. Paul and J. Baker in 
this workshop's proceedings entitled "The Design 
for the Wall Street Journal-based CSR Corpus".

Corpus. 
opinion that such predetermined VP may not repre- 
sent realistic VP, may limit research on automatic 
punctuation, may restrict he task and perplexity, 
may unduly burden the corpus with VP words, and 
may present adifficult and artificial reading task to 
users. As a result, a compromise position was taken 
in which half of the corpus was collected in VP mode 
and half in non-VP mode. 
? Speaker-independence: TheCSR corpus, although 
directed primarily toward speaker-independent rec- 
ognition, also supports research into speaker depen- 
dent recognition. Approximately half of the pilot 
corpus is dedicated to speaker-dependent work. 
? Microphone independence: The primary microphone 
is the traditional Sennheiser model HMD-414. In 
addition, all data were collected also with a second- 
ary microphone. Previously, this second microphone 
was a single far-field pick-up microphone, such as 
the desktop Crown model PZM-6FS. The CSR pilot 
corpus represents a departure from this practice and a 
first attempt at true microphone-independent r cog- 
nition (in much the same spirit as speaker-indepen- 
dent recognition) by using one of many different 
microphones for the altemate (secondary) speech 
channel. 
? Transcription: For the CSR pilot corpus, the original 
source text was preprocessed to produce astring of 
words that represented aswell as practical the string 
of words that would result from reading the source 
text. This word string was then presented tothe sub- 
ject as the prompting text. This approach provided a
very efficient ranscription mechanism, because the 
prompting text could automatically be used as the 
transcription (except when the subject made errors in 
reading). Also, the language model, although per- 
haps a bit unnatural to the extent hat the prompt 
string doesn't represent the statistics of the tree lan- 
guage model, can be more easily and comprehen- 
sively estimated by preprocessing large volumes of 
text rather than by transcribing relatively small 
amounts of speech data. 
The CSR Corpus Coordinating Committee 
The charter of the CSR Corpus Coordinating Committee 
(CCCC) is to coordinate CSR corpus development and to 
resolve issues which arise in CSR corpus development and 
evaluation. There are currently 12 members of the CCCC, 
namely: 
Janet Baker, Dragon 
Jordan Cohen, IDA 
George Doddington (chairman) 
364 
Francis Kubala, BBN 
Dave Pallett, NIST 
Doug Paul, Lincoln Labs 
Mike Phillips, M1T 
Michael Picheny, IBM 
Raja Rajasekaran, TI
Xuedong Huang, CMU 
Mitch Weintraub, SRI 
Chin Lee, AT&T 
This committee was formed at the SLS coordinating com- 
mittee meeting in October 1991. Since that time the com- 
mittee has met ten times, mostly via teleconference. CCCC 
activities have included: 
? Definition of procedures for microphone gain adjust- 
ment and calibration. 
? Defin fion of procedures for transcribing the speech 
data. 
? Monitoring progress in speech data collection and 
transcription. 
? Definition of the data distribution schedule and for- 
mat. 
? Definition of procedures for evaluation of vocabu- 
lary/speaker adaptive systems. 
? Definition of procedures for scoring. 
? Definition of recommended baseline performance 
evaluations. 
The CSR pilot corpus 
One of the primary motivations for creating the CSR task 
and corpus was to provide asufficiently large corpus of data 
to properly support advances in speech recognition technol- 
ogy. This implies a very large effort, with many hundreds of 
hours of speech data being collected. Given the massive 
effort required, and appreciating the untried nature of many 
of the corpus parameters, it was decided that a pilot corpus 
should be collected first to determine the correctness ofthe 
many corpus design decisions and to allow modifications of
these as necessary. 
The CSR pilot corpus is described in a companion paper in 
these proceedings entitled "The Design for the Wall Street 
Journal-based CSR Corpus" by D. Paul and J. Baker. This 
corpus provides for the development and evaluation of both 
speaker-independent (SI) and speaker-dependent (SD) rec- 
ognition. It uses the now-standard DARPA corpus approach 
of providing a three-part corpus: speech data for training 
the speech recognition system ("TRAINING"), speech data 
for developing and optimizing the recognition decision cri-. 
teria ("DEVELOPMENT TEST"), and speech data for per- 
forming the formal performance evaluation 
("EVALUATION TEST"). 
The CSR February 1992 dry run evaluation 
The recommended baseline performance evaluations were 
defined by selection of training data set(s), testing data 
set(s), recognition conditions (vocabulary and language 
model), and scoring conditions. In the course of discussion 
on these issues it became clear that consensus was not pos- 
sible on definition of a single set of evaluation conditions. 
This was in addition to the distinct differences between 
speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) eval- 
uation data and conditions. Some committee members felt 
that here should be no constraint on training material, to 
allow as much freedom as possible to improve performance 
through training data. Others believed strongly that calibra- 
tion of performance improvement was paramount and there- 
fore all sites should be required to use a single baseline set 
of training data. In the end, the committee was able only to 
identify anumber of different training and test conditions as 
"recommended" altematives for a baselnie valuation. 
For training the recommended SI training corpus comprised 
7240 utterances from 84 speakers. The recommended SD 
training corpus comprised the 600 training sentences for 
each of the 12 SD speakers. For the large-data speaker- 
dependent (LSD) training condition, the recommended SD 
training corpus comprised the 2400 training sentences for 
each of the 3 LSD speakers. 
For testing there were a total of 1200 SI test utterances and 
1120 SD test utterances. These data comprised, similarly 
and separately for SI and SD recognition, approximately 
400 sentences constrained toa 5000-word vocabulary, 400 
sentences unconstrained byvocabulary, 200 sentences of 
spontaneous dictation, and these 200 sentences a  read later 
from a prompting text. 
The vocabulary and language models used for the above- 
defined test sets were either unspecified (for the spontane- 
ous and read versions of the spontaneous dictation), or were 
the 5000-word vocabulary and bigram grammar as supplied 
by Doug Paul from an analysis of the preprocessed WSJ 
corpus. (Actually, two different sets of bigram model proba- 
bilities were used, one modeling verbalized punctuation and 
one modeling nonverbalized punctuation. These two were 
used appropriately for the verbalized and nonverbalized 
punctuation portions of the test sets, respectively.) 
Given the rather massive computational challenge of train- 
ing and testing in such a new recognition domain, with 
larger vocabulary and greater amount of test data, not all of 
the test material was processed by all of the sites perform- 
ing evaluation. Also, because of the variety of training and 
evaluation conditions, few results were produced that could 
be compared across ites. Two test sets, however, were eval- 
uated on by more than a single site: Two sites produced 
results on the SD 5000-word VP test set (Dragon and Lin- 
coln), and three sites produced results on the SI 5000-word 
365 
VP test set (CMU, Lincoln, and SRI). These results are 
given in a companion paper on "CSR Pilot Corpus Perfor- 
mance Evaluation" by David Pallett. 
Future CSR corpus effort and issues 
Several issues have been identified that bear on the CSR 
corpus and on potential changes in the design of the corpus: 
? Verbalized punctuation. There is a significant argu- 
ment o discontinue verbalized punctuation, for sev- 
eral reasons: It doubles the number of language 
models and test sets and thus the number of evalua- 
tion conditions. It is artificial in the sense that it is 
statistically unlike normal dictation, it is more diffi- 
cult for many subjects to read, and it seems uperflu- 
ous to the development of the underlying speech 
recognition technology. 
? Preprocessed prompting text. There is argument to 
prompt he user with the natural unpreprocessed t xt 
from the WSJ rather than with the preprocessed 
word strings as produced by the text preprocessor. 
The reason is that the word strings do not represent 
the actual statistics of natural speech (see the com- 
panion paper by Phillips et. al entitled "Collection 
and Analyses of WSJ-CSR Data at MIT"). 
? Spontaneous speech. There is argument that the cur- 
rent paradigm for collecting spontaneous speech is 
not adequately refined to represent those aspects of 
spontaneous speech that are important in actual 
usage, and that spontaneous speech should remain in 
an experimental nd developmental mode during the 
next CSR corpus phase. 
? Adaptation. Speaker adaptation and adaptation tothe 
acoustical environment has emerged as a major 
interest. It is clear that adaptive systems must be 
accommodated in the next phase of the CSR corpus. 
? CSR corpus development effort. It is acknowledged 
that the CSR corpus development effort is a key 
activity in the support and direction of CSR research, 
and that this effort herefore requires program conti- 
nuity and should not be treated as an occasional pro- 
duction demand that can be easily started and 
stopped. 
These issues are currently under debate in the CCCC, and 
the next installment of the CSR corpus, to be called the 
CSR corpus, phase two, will no doubt reflect a continued 
distillation of opinion on these issues.
