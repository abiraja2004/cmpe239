This paper is concerned with the acquisition of the lexi- 
con. In particular, we propose a method that uses ann o 
lo~,ical reasoning to hypothesize new polysemous word 
se,ses. This method is one of a number of knowledge 
acquisition devices to be included in DIRC (Domain 
Independent Retargetable Consultant). DIRC is a kind 
ol intelligent, natm'al anguage-capable consultant kit 
that can be retargeted at different domains. DIRC is 
essentially "emptyoUC" (UNIX Consultant, Wilensky 
et al, 1988). DIRC is to include the language and rea- 
soning mechanisms of UC, plus a large grammar and a 
ge, neral lexicon. The user must then add domain 
kr~owledge, user knowledge and lexieal kqlowledge for 
th,~ area of interest. 
2. Previous Work ha Acq~fisifio~n of the Le.~fico~. 
Th~'re have been ~mmerous attempts to build systems 
that automatic;ally acquir~ word ~~anings. Mostly, 
th~se have f~:n either dietion~,~y ~'e~qders o  attempts ~o 
hypothesize mcanings of cor~plctely unfamiliai ~words 
from context (e.g., Selfridge (1982), (;rangcr (1977)). 
h~ contrast, wc have focussed on the px'obleln of acquiro 
inl; word senses that are related to ones already known. 
gle meaning may be involved in any number of senses, 
each of which has grammatical or other differences. 
Typically, a word has at least one core meaning from 
which the meanings involved in other senses are in some 
sense synchronically based. 
For example, the word "open" has adjectival and verbal 
senses; the verbal senses include some whose meaning 
is, roughly, making physical access available to an 
enclosed region by moving some object (e.g., "open a 
jar", "open a draw", "open the door"). This is prob- 
ably a core meaning of the word. There are several 
senses involvin~g this meaning, just among the verbal 
senses. These senses are differentiated from one another 
by how the components of the meaning relate to the 
verb's valence. For example, one sense has the object 
moved as the patient, and hence as the direct object of 
tile transitive verb (as in "open the door"); another uses 
the container itself as the direct object (e.g., "open the 
jea"'); pedlaps another involves some sort of aperture 
that widens (e.g., "open your throat" or "open the pupil 
of your eyC'). Additionally, each of these components 
of the meaning can be realized as patients by api~aring 
as the subject of the intransitive version of the verb. We 
consider each differentiable valence structure for both 
the Wansitive amt intransitive verb forms as constituting 
different senses, although we presume that the same 
conceptual structure is in all of these xamples. 
22.o A Note on W~d ~er~ses 
Fc~,' the pmlx):~es at hand, we ~'c only concerned with 
w(nd senses that a~c ~;ynchronicaily rclatcd. These may 
be polysemou.,; senses of bldividl~als words, ~u well 
related senses of different words, in addition, we distin-. 
gu~sh meanings or conception structures of a word from 
senses. (We will use file term "meaning" and "con- 
ceptual structure" interehangely in this context.) A sin- 
*'l|ae research reported here is the product of the Berkeley 
Artilicial Inteiligt~ce and Natural Language Processing seminar; 
contribmers include Michael Bravennan, Narciseo Jaramillo, 
DalJ Jurafsky, Eric Kadson, Marc Lufia, Peter Norris, Michael 
Schiff, Nigel Ward, and Dekai Wu. This research was sponsored 
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DoD), 
mo~fitored by Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command 
under Contract N00039-88-C~()292 andby the Office of Naval 
Research, under contract N00014-89-J-3205. 
Yet other senses of "open" have the meaning of caus- 
ing an information-containing item to come into 
existence (e.g., "open a bank account" or "open a file 
oll someone"). This second meaning is probably ba.~'l 
on the first one. Also, the various adjective uses (e.g., 
"the open door") are separate senses in this view hav- 
ing some as yet unspecified relation to the senses 
described above. Finally, other words, e.g., "close", 
have senses that we presume to be related to the various 
senses of "open" just discussed. 
2.2. MIDAS 
Previously, we have succeeded in doing some automatic 
lexical acquisition by exploiting conventional metaphors 
as motivations for linguistic forms. In particular, Martin 
(1988) implemented the MIDAS system which both uses 
metaphoric word senses to help with language under? 
407 
standing, and to extend the lexicon when a new meta- 
phoric use of a word is encountered. For example, the 
sentence "John have Mary a cold." is presumed to 
make recourse to a "a cold is a possession" metaphor. 
We call such a conventionalized metaphor a core  meta- 
phor, since it seems to serve as the basis for related 
metaphoric uses. Thus, the sentence "John gave Mary a 
cold" is presumed to involve the "infecting with a cold 
is giving the cold" metaphor, which entails the previous 
"cold is possession" metaphor. 
Suppose the system encounters an utterance like "John 
got the flu from Mary", but is not familiar with this use 
of the verb "get",  nor with the notion of a flu being 
treated as a possession. Then both the available non? 
metaphoric sense of "get" ,  along with the metaphors 
involving diseases and possession, are brought o bear to 
hypothesize the word sense that might be in playo 
Hypotheses are generated by two kinds of lexical extent 
sion processes: core extension and similarity extension. 
Understanding " et a cold" given an understanding of 
"give a cold" involves core extension, as the core meta~ 
phor "cold is possession" is extende~ to the "ge~i~g" 
concept; understanding " et the flu ~ given a~a under.? 
standing of "get a cold" involves imfiharity extension~ 
as the generalization about a role in the metaphoric 
structure must be extended from colds to diseases in 
general Understanding "get the flu" given an under~ 
standing of "give a cold" involves both kinds of exten- 
sion. 
The MIDAS system has been used in conjunction witt~ 
UC to extend metaphoric word senses in the computer 
domain. The following is an example of MIDAS le~i~ 
ing a new sense of the word "kilF~ given that it knows

MIDAS is discussed in detain in Marti~ (1988)o 
30 Why M~DA~ W~rkn 
We believe that MIDAS works because it is exploiting 
metaphoric subregulafity by a form of analogical rea~ 
soning. That is, it finds a metaphorical usage that is 
closest o the given case according to some conceptual 
metric; it then exploits the structure of the prior meta- 
phor usage to construct an analogous one for the case at 
hand, and proposes this new structure as a hypothetical 
word sense. Note that according to this explanation, 
metaphor does not play a crucial role in the extension 
process. Rather, it is the fact that the metaphor is a 
subregularity rather than the fact that it is a metaphor 
that makes it amenable to analogical exploitation. 
Analogy, of course, has played a prominent role in tradi- 
tional inguistics. Indeed, rather influential linguists (for 
example, Paul (1891) and Bloomfield (1933) seemed to 
attribute all novel language use to analogy. However, 
today, analogy seems almost entirely relegated to 
diachronic processses. A notable xception to this trend 
408 2 
is the wo~k of Skon~n (in press), who appears to advo.~ 
catea vk~w quite similar to our own, although the pri- 
mary foclL~ of his work is morphological. 
Analogy has also been widely studied in artificial intelli- 
gence and cognitive psychology. The work of C~bonell 
(1982) and Burstein (1983) is most relevant to our enter- 
prise, as it explores the role of analogy in knowledge 
acquisition. Similarly, Alterman's (1985, 1988) 
approach to planning shares ome of the stone concerns. 
However, many of the details of Carbonell's and 
Alterman's proposals are specific to problem solving, 
and Burstem'z wo~k is focused on fommlating cou- 
straints on rite relations to be considetv.d for analogical 
mapping. "!bus, their work does not appear to have an 
obvious application to our problem. Many of the difter~ 
ences between analogical reasoning for problem solving 
and language knowledge acquisition are discussed at 
length in Martin (1988). 
Another ihte of related work is the connectionist 
approach iinitiated by Rumelhart and McClelland (1987), 
and explicitly considered as an alterative to acquisition 
by analogy by MacWhinney et al (1989). However, 
there are numerous reasons we believe an explicitly ana~ 
logical framework to be superior. The Rumelhart- 
McClelland model maintains no memory of specific 
cases, but only a statistical summary of them. Also, the 
analogy-b~L~d model can use its knowledge more tlexi~ 
bly, for example, to infer that a word encountered is file 
past tense of a known word, a task that an associationist 
networks could not easily be made to perform. In addle 
~Jon, we interpret as evidence supportive of a position 
?li_ke ours psycholinguistic results uch as those of Cutler 
(1983) and Butterworth (1983), which suggest that 
words are represented in theh ~ lull "nndecomposed '~ 
~'onn, along with some sorts of relations between ielate~i 
words. 
3.L Other K~nds of Lexical Subregularities 
ff MIDAS works by applying analogicM reasoning to 
~xploit metaphoric subregularities, then the question 
~ises as what other kinds of lexicM subregularities there 
might be. One set of candidates i approached in the 
~vork of Brugman (1981, 1984) and Norvig and Lakoff 
(1987). In particular, Norvig and Lakoff (1987) offer 
six types of links between word senses in what they call 
~exical network theory. However, their theory is con? 
(:erned only with senses of one word. Also, there appear 
~o be many more links than these. Indeed, we have no 
J~eason to believe that the number of such subregularitics 
~s bounded in principle. 
We present a partial ist of some of the subregularities 
~ve have encountered. The list below uses a rather inforo 
real rule fi~rmat, and gives a couple of examples of 
words to which the rule is applicable. It is hoped that 
explicating a few examples below will let the reader 
infer the meanings of some of the others: 
(1) function-object-noun -> primary-activity- 
"detemfinerless"-noun 
("the bed" ---> "hi bed, go to bed"; "a  school ~> at 
school"; "any lunch ~-> at lunch"; "the conference -> 
in conference") 
(2) noun ~-> lesembling-in-appearance-noun 
("tree" ~> "(rose) tree"; "nee" ~-> "(shoe) tree"); 
"tiger" --> "(stuffed) tiger", "pencil" -> "pencil (of 
ligb0") 
(3) noun -> having-the-same-functiononoun 
("bed" -> "bed (of leaves)") 
(4) noun -> "involve-concretion"-verb 
("a tree" -> "to tree (a ea0"; "a knife" --> "to knife 
(someone)") 
(5) verb -> verb-w~role-splitting 
("take a book" -> "take a book to Mary", "John 
shaved" -> "John shaved Bill") 
(6) verb -> profiled-componentoverb 
("take a book" -> " t~e a book to the Cape") 
(7) verb--> framedmposifion..verb 
("take a book" -> " t~c  someone to dinner', "go '~ L_> 
"go dancing") 
(8) acfivity-verb~t -> concrefion~.activity-verboi 
("eat an apple" -> "eat \[a meal\]", "drink a coke" --> 
"drink \[alcohol\]", "feed the dog" -> "file dog feeds") 
(9) acfivity-verb-t -> dobj-subj-middle-voice-verbq 
("drive a car" --> "the car drives well") 
(10) activity-verbq o-> activity-verb+primaryocategory 
("John dreamed" -> "John dreamed a dream"; "John 
slept" -> "John slept the sleep of the innocent") 
(11) activity~verboi -> do-cause-activity-verb-t(patient 
as subject) 
("John slept" -> "The bed sleeps five") 
(12) activity~verb -> activity-of-noun 
("to cry" -> "a cry (in the wilderness)"; "to punch" 
-> "a punch (in the mouth)") 
(13) activity-verb <-> product-of-activity-noun 
("copy the paper" <-> "a copy of the paper"; xerox, 
telegram, telegraph) 
(14) functional-noun-> use-function-verb 
("the telephone" -> "telephone John"; machine, 
motorcycle, telegraph) 
(15) object-noun -> central-component-of-object 
("a bed" -> "bought abed \[=frame with not mattress\]; 
"an apple" -> "eat an apple \[=without the core\]")) 
Consider the first rule. This rule states that, for some 
noun whose core meaning is a functional object, there is 
another sense, also a noun, that occurs without determi- 
nation, and means the primary activity associated with 
the first sense. For example, the word "bed" has as a 
core meaning a functional object used for sleeping. 
However, the Word can also be used in utterances like 
"go to bed" and "before bed" (but not, say, "*during 
bed"). In these cases, the noun is determinerless, and 
means something akin to sleeping. Other examples 
include "jail", "conference", school" and virtually 
all the meal terms, e.g., "lunch", "tea", "dinner". 
British English allows "in hospital", while American 
English &~es not. 
The dialect difference underscores the point that this is 
truly a subregularity: concepts that might be expressed 
this way ,are not necessarily expressed this way. Also, 
we chose this example not because it in itself is a partic- 
ularly important generalization about English, but pre- 
cisely because it is not. That is, there appear to be many 
such facts of limited scope, and each of them may be 
useful for learning analogous cases. 
Consider also rule 4, which relates function nouns to 
verbs. Examples of this are "tree" as in "The dog 
treed the cat" and "knife" as in "The murderer knifed 
his victim". The applicable rule states that the verb 
means ome specific activity involving the core meaning 
of the noun. I.e., the verbs are treated as a sort of con- 
ventionalized denominalization. Note that he activity is 
presumed to be specific, and that the way in which it 
must be "concreted" is assumed to be pragmatically 
determined. Thus, the rule can only tell us that "tree- 
ing" involves a tree, but only our world knowledge 
might suggest to us that it involves cornering; similarly, 
the rule can tell us that "knifing" involves the use of a 
knife, but cannot ell us that it means tabbing aperson, 
and not say, just cutting. 
As a final illustration, consider ule 5, so-called "role 
splitting" (this is the same as Norvig and Lakoffs 
semantic role differentiation link). This rule suggests 
that, given a verb in which two thematic roles are real- 
ized by a single complement may have another sense in 
which these two complements are realized separately. 
For example, in "John took a book from Mary", John is 
both the recipient and the agent. However, in "John 
took a book to Mary", John is only the agent, and Mary 
is the recipient. Thus, the sense of "take" involved in 
4 
the first sentence, which we suggest corresponds to a 
core meaning, is the basis for the sense used in the 
second, in which the roles coinciding in the first are real- 
ized separately. A similar prediction might be made 
from an intransitive verb like "shave", in which agent 
and patient coincide, to the existence of a transitive verb 
"shave" in which the patient is realized separately as 
the direct object. (Of course, the tendency of patients to 
get realized as direct objects in English should also help 
motivate this fact, and can presumably also be exploited 
analogically.) 
4. An Analogy-based Model of Lexical Acquisition 
We have been attempting toextend MIDAS.-style word 
hypothesizing to be able to propose new word senses by 
using analogy to exploit these other kinds of lexical 
subregularities. At this point, our work has been rather 
preliminary, but we can at least sketch out the basic 
architecture of our proposal and comment on the prob- 
lems we have yet to resolve. 
(A) Detect unknown word sense. For example, suppose 
the system encountered the following phrase: 
"at breakfast" 
Suppose further that the function noun "breakfast" 
were known to the system, but the determinerless u age 
were not. In this case, the system would hypothesize 
that it is lacking a word sense because of a failure to 
parse the sentence. 
(B) Find relevant cases/subregularities. Cues from the 
input would be used to suggest prior relevant lexieal 
knowledge. In our example, the retrieved cases might 
include the following: 
bed-I/bed-3, class-I/class-4 
Here we have numbered word senses o that the first 
element of each pair designates a sense involving acore 
meaning, and the latter a determineless-activity type of 
sense. We may have also already computed and stored 
relevant subregularities. If so, then these would be 
retrieved as well. 
Relevant issues here are the indexing and retrieval of 
cases and subregularities. Our assumption isthat we can 
retrieve relevant cases by a conjunction of simple cues, 
like "noun", "functional meaning", "extended etex- 
minerless noun sense", etc., and then rely on the next 
phase to discriminate further among these. 
(C) Chose the most pertinent case or subregularity. 
Again, by analogy to MIDAS, some distance metric is 
used to pick the best datum to analogize from. In this 
410 b 
ca~e, perhaps the correct choice would be the following: 
class- 1/cl~t~s-4 
One motivation for this selection is that "class" is com- 
patible with "at" ,  as is the case in point. 
Finding the right metric is the primary issue here. The 
MIDAS metric is a simple sum of two factors: (i) the 
length of the core-relationship from the input source to 
the source of the candidate metaphor, and (ii) hierarchi- 
cal distance between the two concepts. Both factors are 
measured by the number of links in the representation 
that must be traversed to get from one concept o the 
other. The hierarchical distance factor of the MIDAS 
metric seems directly relevant to other cases. However, 
there is no obvious counterpart to the core-relationship 
component. One possible reason for this is that met& 
phoric extensions are more complex than most other 
kinds; if so, then the MIDAS metric may still be applica- 
ble to the other subregularities, which are just simpler 
special cases. 
(D) Analogize to a new meaning. Given the best case or 
subregularity, the system will attempt to hypothesize a 
new word sense. For example, in the case at hand, we 
wo~dd like a representation for the meaning in quotes to 
be produced. 
class- 1/class-4 :: 
breakfast-1/"period of eating breakfast" 
In Ihe case of MIDAS, the metaphoric structure of pre- 
vio~ls examples was assumed to be available. Then, 
once a best match was established, it is relatively 
straightforward togeneralize or extend this structure to 
apply to the new input. The same would be true in the 
general case, provided that the relation between stored 
polysemous word senses is readily available. 
(E) Determine the extent of generalization. Supposing 
that a single new word sense can be successfully pro- 
pos~, the que.,;tion arises as to whether just this particu- 
lar word sense is all the system can hypothesize, or 
whether some "local productivity" is possible. For 
example, if this is the first meal tema the system has seen 
as having a determinerless activity sense, we suspect 
that only the single sense should be generated. How- 
ever, if it is the second such meal term, then the first one 
would have been the likely basis for the analogy, and a 
generalization to meal terms in general may be 
attempted. 
09 Record a new entry. The new sense needs to be 
storcA in the lexicon, and indexed for further eference. 
Thi,; task may interact closely with (E), although gen- 
eralizing to unattested cases and computing explicit 
subregularities are logically independent. 
There are many additional problems to be addressed 
beyond the ones alluded to above. In particular, there is 
the issue of the role of world knowledge in the proposed 
process. In the example above, the system must know 
that the activity of caring is the primary one associated 
with breakfast. A more dramatic example is the role of 
world knowledge in hypothesizing the meaning of 
"treed" in expressions like "the dog treed the cat", 
assuming that the system is acquainted with the noun 
"tree". All an analogical reasoning mechanism can do 
is suggest hat some specific activity associated with 
trees is involved; the application of world knowledge 
would have to do the rest. 
5. Other Directions of Investigation 
We have also been investigating exploiting subregalari- 
ties in "intelligent dictionary reading". This project 
involves an additional idea, namely, that one could best 
use a dictionary to gain lexical knowledge by bringing to 
bear on it a fall natural anguage processing capability. 
One problem we have encountered is that dictionaries 
are full of inaccuracies about he meaning of words. For 
example, even relatively good dictionaries have poor 
entries for the likes of determinerless nouns like "bed". 
E.g., Webster's New World (Second Edition) simply 
lists "bedtime" as a sense of "bed"; Longman's Die- 
tionary of Contemporary English (New Edition) uses 
"in bed" as an example of the ordinary noun "bed", 
then explicitly lists the phrase "time for bed" as mean- 
ing "time to go to sleep", and gives a few other deter- 
minerless usages, leaving it to the reader to infer a gen- 
eralization.* However, a dictionary reader with 
knowledge of the subregularity mentioned above might 
be able to correct such deficiencies, and come up with a 
better meaning that the one the dictionary supplies. 
Thus, we plan to explore augmenting our intelligent dic- 
tionary reader with the ability to use subregularities to 
compensate for inadequate dictionary entries. 
We are also attempting to apply the same approach to 
acquiring the semantics of constructions. In particular, 
we are investigating verb-particular combinations and 
conventionalized noun phrases (e.g., nominal com- 
pounds). We are also looking at constructions like the 
ditransitive (i.e., dative alternation), which seem also to 
display a kind of polysemy. Specifically, Goldberg 
(1989, 1990) has argued that much of the data on this 
construction can be accounted for in terms of subclasses 
that are conventionally associated with the construction 
itself, rather than with lexical rules and transformations 
as proposed, for example, by Gropen et al (1989). If 
so, then the techniques for the acquisition of polysemous 
*Longman's also defines "make the bed" as "make it ready for 
sleeping in". We have no idea how to oope with such errors, but 
they do underscore the problem. 
411 
lexical items should prove equally applicable to the 
acquisition of knowledge about such constructions. We 
are attempting todetermine whether this is the case.
