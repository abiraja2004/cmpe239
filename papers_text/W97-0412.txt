Abstract 
This position paper sketches the 
author's research in six areas related to 
speech translation: interactive disambig- 
uation; system architecture; the interface 
between speech recognition and analysis; 
the use of natural pauses for segmenting 
utterances; dialogue acts; and the tracking 
of lexical co-occurrences. 
Introduction 
This position paper reviews some aspects of my 
research in speech translation since 1992. Since the 
purpose is to prompt discussion, the treatment is
informal and speculative, with frequent reference to 
work in progress. 
The paper sketches work in six areas: interactive 
disambiguation; system architecture; the interface 
between speech recognition and analysis; the use of 
natural pauses for segmenting utterances; dialogue 
acts; and the tracking of lexical co-occurrences. 
There is no attempt to provide a balanced survey of 
the speech translation scene. However, I have 
touched upon a number of research areas which 
seem to me of particular interest. 
1 Interactive Disambiguation 
At the present state of the art, several stages of 
speech translation leave ambiguities which current 
techniques cannot yet resolve correctly and 
automatically. Such residual ambiguity plagues 
speech recognition, analysis, transfer, and 
generation alike. 
Since users generally can resolve these 
ambiguities, it seems reasonable to incorporate 
facilities for interactive disambiguation i to speech 
translation systems, especially those aiming for 
broad coverage. A good idea of the range of work in 
this area can be gained by browsing the proceedings 
of MIDDIM-96 (the International Seminar on 
Multimodal Interactive Disambiguation, Col de 
Porte, France, August 11 - 15, 1996). 
In fact, (Seligman 1997) suggests that, by 
stressing such interactive disambiguation - -  for 
instance, by using isolated-word ictation rather 
than connected speech for input, and by adapting 
existing techniques for interactive disambiguation f
text translation (Boitet 1996, Blanchon 1996) - -  
practically usable speech translation systems may 
be constructable in the near term. The paper also 
reports on an Internet-based demo along these lines 
(Kowalski, Rosenberg, and Krause 1995). In such 
"quick and dirty" or "low road" speech translation 
systems, user interaction is substituted for system 
integration. For example, the interface between 
speech recognition and analysis can be supplied 
entirely by the user, who can correct SR results 
before passing them to translation components, 
thus bypassing any attempt at effective 
communication r feedback between SR and MT. 
The argument, however, is not that the "high road" 
toward integrated and maximally automatic systems 
should be abandoned. Rather, it is that the "low 
road" of forgoing integration and embracing 
interaction may offer the quickest route to 
widespread usability, and that experience with real 
use is vital for progress. Clearly, the "high road" is 
the most desirable for the longer term: integration 
of knowledge sources is a fundamental issue for 
both cognitive and computer science, and 
maximally automatic use is intrinsically desirable. 
The suggestion, then, is that the low and high roads 
be traveled in tandem; and that even systems aiming 
for full automaticity recognize the need for 
interactive resolution when automatic resolution is 
insufficient. 
2 System Architecture 
An ideal architecture for "high road" or integration- 
intensive speech translation systems would allow 
global coordination of, cooperation between, and 
feedback among, components (speech recognition, 
analysis, transfer, etc.), thus moving away from 
linear or pipeline arrangements. For instance, 
83 
speech recognition, as it moves through an 
utterance, should be able to benefit from 
preliminary analysis results for segments earlier in 
the utterance. The architecture should also be 
modular, so that a variety of configurations can be 
tried: it should be possible, for  instance, to 
exchange competing speech recognition 
components; and it should be possible to combine 
components not explicitly intended for work 
together, even if these are written in different 
languages or running on different machines. 
Blackboard architectures have been proposed 
(Erman and Lesser, 1980) to permit cooperation 
among components. In such systems, all 
participating components read from and write to a 
central set of data structures - -  the blackboard. To 
share this common area. however, the components 
must all "speak a common (software) language". 
Modularity thus suffers, since it is difficult to 
assemble a system from components developed 
separately. Further, blackboard systems are widely 
seen as difficult to debug, since control is typically 
distributed, with each component determining 
independently when to act and what actions to take. 
In order to maintain the cooperative benefits of a 
blackboard system while enhancing modularity and 
facilitating central coordination or control of 
components, (Seligman and Boitet 1994 and Boitet 
and Seligman 1994) proposed and demonstrated a 
"whiteboard" architecture for speech translation. As 
in the blackboard architecture, a central data 
structure is maintained which contains selected 
results of all components. However, the 
components do not access this "whiteboa.d" 
directly. Instead, only a privileged program called 
the Coordinator can read from it and write to it. 
Each component communicates with the 
Coordinator and the whiteboard via a go-between 
program called a manager, which handles messages 
to and from the Coordinator in a set of mailbox 
files. Because files are used as data holding areas in 
this way, components (and their managers) can be 
freely distributed across many machines. Managers 
are not only mailmen, but interpreters: they 
translate between the reserved language of the 
whiteboard and the native languages of the 
components, which are thus free to differ. In our 
demo, the whiteboard was maintained in a 
commercial Lisp-based object-oriented language, 
while components included independently.developed 
speech recognition, analysis, and word-lookup 
components written in C. Overall, the whiteboard 
architecture can be seen as an adaptation of 
blackboard architectures for client-server operations: 
the Coordinator becomes the main client for several 
components behaving as servers. 
Since the Coordinator surveys the whiteboard, in 
which are assembled the selected results of all 
components, all represented in a single software 
interlingua, it is indeed well situated to provide 
central or global coordination. However, any de~'ee 
of distributed control can also be achieved by 
providing appropriate programs alongside the 
Coordinator which represent the components from 
the whiteboard side. That is, to dilute the 
Coordinator's omnipotence, a number of demi-gods 
can be created. In one possible partly-distributed 
control structure, the Coordinator would oversee a 
set of agendas, one or more for each component. 
A closely-related effort to create a modular 
"agent-based" (client-server-style) architecture with a 
central data structure, usable for many sorts of 
systems including speech translation, is described in 
(Julia et al1997). Lacking a central board but still 
aiming in a similar spirit for modularity in various 
sorts of translation applications is the project 
described in (Zajac and Casper 1997). 
3 Interface between Speech 
Recognition and MT Analysis 
In a certain sense, speech recognition and analysis 
for MT are comparable problems. Both require the 
recognition of the most probable sequences of 
elements. In speech recognition, sequences of short 
speech segments must be recognized as phones, and 
sequences of phones must be recognized as words. 
In analysis, sequences of words must be recognized 
as phrases, sentences, and utterances. 
Despite this similarity, current speech translation 
systems use quite different echniques for phone, 
word, and syntactic recognition. Phone recognition 
is generally handled using hidden Markov models 
(HMMs); word recognition is often handled using 
Viturbi-style search for the best paths in phone 
lattices; and sentence recognition is handled through 
a variety of parsing techniques. 
It can be argued that these differences are justified 
by differences of scale, perplexity, and 
meaningfulness. On the other hand, they introduce 
the need for interfaces between processing levels. 
The processors may thus become black boxes to 
each other, when seamless connection and easy 
communication might well be preferable. In 
particular, word recognition and syntactic analysis 
(of phrases, sentences, and utterances) hould have a 
lot to say to each other: the probability of a word 
should depend on its place in the top-down context 
of surrounding words, just as the probability of a 
phrase or larger syntactic unit should depend on the 
bottom-up information of the words which it 
contains. 
84 
To integrate speech recognition and analysis 
more tightly, it is possible to employ a single 
grammar for both processes, one whose terminals 
are phones and whose non-terminals are words, 
phrases, sentences, etc.' This phone-grounded 
strategy was used to good effect e.g. in the HMM- 
LR speech recognition component of the ASURA 
speech translation system (Morimotb et al1993), in 
which an LR parser extended a parse phone by 
phone left to right while building a full syntactic 
tree.: The technique worked well for scripted 
examples. For spontaneous examples, however, 
performance was unsatisfactory, because of the 
gaps, repairs, and other noise common in 
spontaneous speech. To deal with such structural 
problems, an island-driven parsing style might well 
be preferable. An island-based chart parser, like that 
of (Stock et al1989), would be a good candidate. 
However, chart initialization presents some 
technical problems. There is no difficulty in 
computing a lattice from spotted phones, given 
information regarding the maximum gap and 
overlap of phones. But it is not trivial to convert 
that lattice into a "chart" (i.e. multi-path finite state 
automaton) without introducing spurious extra 
paths. The author has implemented a Common Lisp 
program which does so correctly, based on an 
algorithm by Christian Boitet. Experiments with 
bottom-up island-driven chart parsing from charts 
initialized with phones are anticipated. 
4 Use of Pauses for Segmentation 
It is widely believed that prosody can prove crucial 
for speech recognition and analysis of spontaneous 
speech, but effective demonstrations have been few. 
Several aspects of prosody might be exploited: pitch 
contours, rhythm, volume modulation, etc. 
However, (Seligman, Hosaka, and Singer 1996) 
propose focusing on natural pauses as an aspect of 
prosody which is both important and relatively easy 
to detect automatically. 
Given the frequency of utterances in spontaneous 
speech which are not fully well-formed - -  which 
contain repairs, hesitations, and fragments - -  
strategies for dividing and conquering utterances 
Inclusion of other levels is also possible. At the 
lower limit, assuming the grammar were stochastic, 
one could even use sub-phone speech segments as 
grammar terminals, thus subsuming even HMM-based 
phone recognition in the parsing regime. At an 
intermediate level between phones and words, 
syllables could be used. 
"- The parse tree was not used for analysis, however. 
Instead. it was discarded, and a unification-based parser 
began a new parse for MT purposes on a text string 
passed from speech recognition. 
would be quite useful. The suggestion is that 
natural pauses can play a part in such a strategy: 
that pause units, or segments within utterances 
bounded by natural pauses, can provide chunks 
which (1) are reliably shorter and less variable in 
length than entire utterances and (2) are relatively 
well-behaved internally from the syntactic 
viewpoint, though analysis of the relationships 
among them appears more problematic. 
Four specific questions are addressed: (1) Are 
pause units reliably shorter than whole utterances? 
If they were not, they could hardly be useful in 
simplifying analysis. It was found however, that in 
the corpus investigated (Loken-Kim, Yato, 
Kurihara, Fais, and Furukawa 1993; Furukawa, 
Yato, and Loken-Kim 1993), pause units are in fact 
about 60% the length of entire utterances, on the 
average, when measured in Japanese morphemes. 
The average length of pause units was 5.89 
morphemes, as compared with 9.39 for whole 
utterances. Further, pause units are less variable in 
length than entire utterances: the standard eviation 
is 5.79 as compared with 12.97. (2) Would 
hesitations give even shorter, and thus perhaps even 
more manageable, segments if used as alternate or 
additional boundaries? The answer seems to be that 
because hesitations o often coincide with pause 
boundaries, the segments they mark out are nearly 
the same as the segments marked by pauses alone. 
No combination of expressions was found which 
gave segments as much as one morpheme shorter 
than pause units on average. (3) Is the syntax 
within pause units relatively manageable? A manual 
survey showed that, once hesitation expressions axe 
filtered from them, some 90% of the pause units 
studied can be parsed using standard Japanese 
grammars; a variety of special problems appear in 
the remaining 10%. (4) Is translation of isolated 
pause units a possibility? We found that a majority 
of the pause units in four dialogues gave 
understandable translations into English when 
translated by hand. 
The study provided encouragement for a "divide 
and conquer" analysis trategy, in which parsing and 
perhaps translation of pause units is carried out 
before, or even without, attempts to create coherent 
analyses of entire utterances. 
As mentioned, parsability of spontaneous 
utterances can be enhanced by filtering hesitation 
expressions from them in preprocessing. Research 
on spotting techniques for such expressions would 
thus seem to be worthwhile. Researchers can 
exploit speakers' tendency to lengthen hesitations, 
and to use them just before or after natural pauses. 
85 
5 Communicat ive Acts 
Speech act analysis (Searle 1969) - -  analysis in 
terms of illocutionary acts like INFORM, WH- 
QUESTION, REQUEST, etc. - -  can be useful for 
speech translation in numerous ways. Six uses, 
three related to translation and three to speech 
processing, will be mentioned here. Concerning 
translation, it is necessary to: 
eldentify the speech acts of the current utterance. 
Speech act analysis of the current utterance is 
necessary for translation. For instance, the 
English pattern "can you (VP, bare infinitive)?" 
may express either an ACTION-REQUEST or 
a YN-QUESTION (yes/no-question). Resolu- 
tion of this ambiguity will be crucial for 
translation. 
oldenti~, related utterances. Utterances in dia- 
logues are often closely related: for instance, 
one utterance may be a prompt and another 
utterance may be its response; and the proper 
translation of a response often depends on 
identification and analysis of its prompt. For 
example, Japanese hai can be translated as yes 
if it is the response to a YN-QUESTION, but 
as all right if it is the response to an ACTION- 
REQUEST. Further, the syntax of a prompt 
may become a factor in the final translation. 
Thus, in a responding utterance hai, sou desu 
(meaning literally "yes, that's right"), the 
segment sou desu may be most naturally 
translated as he can, you will, she does, etc., 
depending on the structure and content of the 
prompting question. The recognition of such 
prompt-response relationships will require 
analysis of typical speech act sequences. 
oAnalyze relationships among segments and 
fragments. Early processing of utterances may 
yield fragments which must later be assembled 
to form the global interpretation for an 
utterance. Speech act sequence analysis should 
help fit fragments together, since we hope to  
learn about ypical act groupings. 
Concerning speech processing, it is necessary to: 
oPredict speech acts to aid speech recognition. If 
we can predict he coming speech acts, we can 
partly predict their surface patterns. This 
prediction can be used to constrain speech 
recognition. For example, in recognizing 
spoken Japanese, if we can predict he relative 
probability that the current utterance is a YN- 
QUESTION as opposed to an INFORM, we 
may be able to differentiate utterance-final ka (a 
question particle) and utterance-final ga (a 
conjunction or politeness particle), which are 
often very similar phonetically. 
? Provide conventions for prosody recognition. 
Once spontaneous data is labeled, speech 
recognition researchers can try to recognize 
prosodic ues to aid in speech act recognition 
and disambiguation. For instance, they can try 
to distinguish segments expressing INFORMs 
and YN-QUESTIONs according to the F0 
curves associated with them - -  a distinction 
which would be especially useful for 
recognizing YN-QUESTIONs with no mor- 
phological or syntactic markings. 
eProvide conventions for speech synthesis. 
Similarly, speech synthesis researchers can try 
to provide more natural prosody by exploiting 
speech act information. Once relations between 
prosody and speech acts have been extracted 
from corpora labeled with speech act 
information, researchers can attempt to supply 
natural prosody for synthesized utterances 
according to the specified speech acts. For 
instance, more natural pronunciations can be 
attempted for YN-QUESTIONs, or for 
CONFIRMATION-QUESTIONs (including tag 
questions in English, as in The train goes east, 
doesn't it?). 
While a well-founded set of speech act labels 
would be useful, it has not been clear what the 
theoretical foundation should be. As a result, no 
speech act set has yet become standard. Labels are 
proposed intuitively or by trial and error. 
Speakers' goals can certainly be analyzed in 
many ways. However, (Seligman, Fais, and 
Tomokiyo 1995) hypothesize that only a limited set 
of goals is conventionally expressed in a given 
language. For just these goals, relatively fixed 
expressive patterns are learned by speakers when 
they learn the language. In English, for instance, it 
is conventional to express certain invitations using 
the patterns "Lets *" or "Shall we *?" In Japanese, 
one conventionally expresses similar goals via the 
patterns "(V, combining stem)mashou" or "(V, 
combining stem)masen ka?" 
The proposal is to focus on discovery and 
exploitation of these conventionally-expressible 
speech acts, or Communicative Acts. The relevant 
expressive patterns and the contexts within which 
they are found have the great virtue of being 
objectively observable; and assuming the use of 
these patterns is common to all native speakers, it
should be possible to reach a consensus 
classification of the patterns according to their 
contextualized meaning and use. This functional 
classification should yield a set of language-specific 
speech act labels which can help to put speech act 
analysis for speech translation on a firmer 
foundation. 
86 
The first reason to analyze speech acts in terms 
of obse~able linguistic patterns, then, is the 
measure of objectivity thus gained: the discovery 
process is to some degree mpirical, data-driven, or 
corpus-based. A second reason is that on-line 
analysis, being shallow or surface-bound, should be 
relatively quick as opposed to plan-based analysis. 
Plan-based analysis may well proCe necessary for 
certain purposes, but it is quite expensive. For 
applications like speech translation which must be 
carried out in nearly real time, it seems wise to 
exploit shallow analysis as far as possible. 
With these advantages of cue-based processing - -  
empirical grounding and speed - -  come certain 
limitations. When analyzing in terms of CAs, we 
cannot expect o recognize all communicative goals. 
Instead, we restrict our attention to communicative 
goals which can be expressed using conventional 
linguistic cue patterns. Communicative goals which 
cannot be described as Communicative Acts include 
utterance goals which are expressed non- 
conventionally (compare the non-conventional 
warning May I call your attention to a potentially 
dangerous dog to the conventional WARNING 
Look out for the dog.t); or goals which are expressed 
only implicitly (It's cold outside as an implicit 
request o shut the window); or goals which can 
only be defined in terms of relations between 
utterances. (While speakers often repeat an 
interlocutor's utterance to confirm it, we do not use 
a REPEAT-TO-CONFIRM CA, since it is appar- 
ently signaled by no cue patterns, and thus could 
only be recognized by noting inter-utterance 
repetition.) 
Given that the aim is to classify expressive 
patterns according to their meaning and function, 
how should this be done? The paper describes a 
paraphrase-based approach: native speakers are 
polled as to the essential equivalence of expressive 
patterns in specified discourse contexts. If by 
consensus everal patterns can yield paraphrases 
which are judged equivalent in context, and if the 
resulting pattern set is not identical to any 
competing pattern set, then it can be considered to 
define a Communicative Act. 
Communicative Acts are defined in terms of 
monolingual conventions for expressing certain 
communicative goals using certain cue patterns. For 
translation purposes, however, it will be necessary 
to compare the conventions in language A with 
those in language B. With this goal in mind, the 
discovery procedure was applied to twin corpora of 
Japanese-Japanese and English-English spontaneous 
dialogues concerning transportation directions and 
hotel accommodations (Loken-Kim et al 1993). 
CAs were first identified according to monolingual 
criteria. Then, by observing translation relations 
among the English and Japanese cue patterns, the 
resulting Eriglish and Japanese CAs were compared. 
Interestingly, it was found that most of the 
proposed CAs seem valid for both English and 
Japanese: only two out of 27 CAs seem to be 
monolingual for the corpus in question. 
6 Tracking Lexical Co-occurrences 
In the processing of spontaneous language, the need 
for predictions at the morphological or lexical level 
is clear. For bottom-up arsing based on phones or 
syllables, the number of lexical candidates is 
explosive. It is crucial to predict which 
morphological or lexical items are likely so that 
candidates can be weighted appropriately. (Compare 
such lexical prediction with the Communicative 
Act-based predictions discussed above. In general, it 
is hoped that by predicting CAs we can in turn 
predict he structural elements of their cue patterns. 
We are now shifting the discussion to the prediction 
of open-class elements instead. The hope is that the 
two sorts of prediction will prove complementary.) 
N-grams provide such predictions only at very 
short ranges. To support bottom-up parsing of 
noisy material containing gaps and fragments, 
longer-range predictions are needed as well. Some 
researchers have proposed investigation of 
associations beyond the n-gram range, but the 
proposed associations remain relatively short-range 
(about five words). While stochastic grammars can 
provide somewhat longer-range predictions than n- 
grams, they predict only within utterances. Our 
interest, however, extends to predictions on the 
scale of several utterances. 
Thus (Seligman 1994) proposes to permit the 
definition of windows in a transcribed corpus within 
which co-occurrences of morphological or lexical 
elements can be examined. A window is defined as a 
sequence of minimal segments, where a segment is 
typically a turn, but can also be a block delimited 
by suitable markers in the transcript. A flexible set 
of facilities (CO-OC) has been implemented in 
Common Lisp to aid collection of such discourse- 
range co-occurrence information and to provide 
quick access to the statistics for on-line use. 
Sparse data is somewhat less problematic for 
long-range than for short-range predictions, since it 
is in general easier to predict what is coming "soon" 
than what is coming next. Even so, there is never 
quite enough data; so smoothing will remain 
important. CO-OC can support various statistical 
smoothing measures. However, since these 
techniques are likely to remain insufficient, a new 
technique for semantic smoothing is proposed and 
supported: researchers can track co-occurrences of 
semantic tokens associated with words or morphs in 
87 
addition to co-occurrences of the words or morphs 
themsel~,es. The semantic tokens are obtained from 
standard on-line thesaura. The benefits of such 
semantic smoothing appear especially in the 
possibility of retrieving reasonable semantically- 
mediated associations for morphs which are rare or 
absent in a training corpus. 
A weighted co-occurrence b tweerf morphemes or 
lexemes can be viewed as an association between 
these itemsi so the set of co-occurrences which CO- 
OC discovers can be viewed as an associative or 
semantic network. Spreading activation within such 
networks is often proposed as a method of lexicai 
disambiguation. (For example, if the concept 
MONEY has been observed, then the lexical item 
bank has the meaning closest to MONEY in the 
network: "savings institution" rather than "edge of 
river", etc.) Thus disambiguation becomes a second 
possible application of CO-OC's results, beyond the 
abovementioned primary use for constraining speech 
recognition. A third possible use is in the discovery 
of topic transitions: we can hypothesize that a span 
within a dialogue where few co-occurrence 
predictions are fulfilled is a topic boundary. Once 
the new topic is determined, appropriate constraints 
can be exploited, e.g. by selecting a relevant sub- 
grammar. 
Preliminary tests of CO-OC were carried out on a 
corpus of Japanese-Japanese dialogues concerning 
street directions and hotel arrangements at ATR 
Interpreting Telecommunications Laboratories. 
However, further testing is necessary to demonstrate 
the reliability and usefulness of the approach. A 
principle aim would be to determine how large the 
corpus must be before consistent co-occurrence 
predictions are obtained. 
Conclusions 
useful for speech recognition, lexical 
disambiguation, and topic boundary recognition.

The six areas of research just examined suggest a 
six-item wish list for an experimental speech 
translation system. (1) The system would include 
facilities for interactive disambiguation of both 
speech and translation candidates. (2) Its architecture 
would allow modular reconfiguration and global 
coordination of components. (3) The system would 
employ a grammar whose terminals were phones, 
recognizing both words and syntactic structures in a 
uniform and integrated manner, e.g. via island- 
driven chart parsing. (4) Natural pauses and other 
aspects of prosody would be used to segment 
utterances and otherwise aid analysis. (5) Speech or 
dialogue acts would be defined in terms of their cue 
patterns, and analyses based upon them would be 
exploited for speech recognition and analysis. (6)
