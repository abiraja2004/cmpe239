Abstract
This paper reports our ongoing project for
constructing an English multiword expression
(MWE) dictionary and NLP tools based on
the developed dictionary. We extracted func-
tional MWEs from the English part of Wik-
tionary, annotated the Penn Treebank (PTB)
with MWE information, and conducted POS
tagging experiments. We report how the
MWE annotation is done on PTB and the re-
sults of POS and MWE tagging experiments.
1 Introduction
While there have been a great progress in POS
tagging and parsing of natural language sentences
thanks to the advancement of statistical and corpus-
based methods, there still remains difficulty in sen-
tence processing stemming from syntactic discrep-
ancies. One of such discrepancies is caused by mul-
tiword expressions (MWEs), which are known and
defined as expressions having ?idiosyncratic inter-
pretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)?
(Sag et al, 2002).
Sag et al (2002) classifies MWEs largely into the
following categories:
? Lexicalized phrases
? fixed expressions: Those having fixed
word order and form (e.g. by and large).
? semi-fixed expressions: Those having
fixed word order with lexical variation
such as inflection, determiner selection,
etc. (e.g. come up with).
? syntactically flexible expressions: Those
having a wide range of syntactic variabil-
ity (e.g. phrasal verbs that take an NP ar-
gument between or following the verb and
the particle).
? Institutionalized phrases
? Phrases that are semantically and syntac-
tically compositional, such as collocations
(e.g. traffic light).
This paper reports our ongoing project for devel-
oping an English MWE dictionary of a broad cov-
erage and MWE-aware natural language processing
tools. The main contributions of this paper are as
follows:
1. Construction of an English MWE dictionary
(mainly consisting of functional expressions)
through extraction from Wiktionary1.
2. Annotation of MWEs in the Penn Treebank
(PTB).
3. Implementation of an MWE-aware POS tagger
and evaluation of its performance.
2 Related work
While there is a variety of MWE researches only a
few of them focus on MWE lexicon construction.
Though some examples, such as French adverb dic-
tionaries (Laporte and Voyatzi, 2008; Laporte et al,
2008), a Dutch MWE dictionary (Gre?goire, 2007)
and a Japanese MWE dictionary (Shudo et al, 2011)
have been constructed, there is no freely available
English MWE dictionary with a broad coverage.
Moreover, MWE-annotated corpora are only
available for a few languages, including French and
1https://en.wiktionary.org
139
Swedish. While the British National Corpus is anno-
tated with MWEs, its coverage is far from complete.
Considering this situation, we started construction
of an English MWE dictionary (with functional ex-
pressions first) and classified their occurrences in
PTB into MWE or literal usage, obtaining MWE-
annotated version of PTB.
The effect of MWE dictionaries have been re-
ported for various NLP tasks. Nivre and Nilsson
(2004) investigated the effect of recognizing MWEs
in syntactic dependency parsing of Swedish. Ko-
rkontzelos and Manandhar (2010) showed perfor-
mance improvement of base phrase chunking by an-
notating compound and proper nouns. Finlayson
and Kulkarni (2011) reported the effect of recogniz-
ing MWEs on word sense disambiguation.
Most of the previous approaches to MWE recog-
nition are based on frequency or collocation mea-
sures of words in large scale corpora. On the other
hand, some previous approaches tried to recognize
new MWEs using an MWE lexicon and MWE-
annotated corpora. Constant and Sigogne (2011)
presented MWE recognition using a Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs)-based tagger with the BIO
schema. Green et al (2011) proposed an MWE
recognition method using Tree Substitution Gram-
mars. Constant et al (2012) compared two phrase
structure analysis methods, one that uses MWE
recognition as preprocessing and the other that uses
a reranking method.
Although MWEs show a variety of flexibilities
in their appearance, most of the linguistic analyses
consider the fixed type of MWEs. For example, the
experiments by Nivre and Nilsson (2004) focus on
fixed expressions that fall into the following cate-
gories:
1. Multiword names
2. Numerical expressions
3. Compound function words
(a) Adverbs
(b) Prepositions
(c) Subordinating conjunctions
(d) Determiners
(e) Pronouns
Multiword names and numerical expressions be-
have as noun phrases and have limited syntactic
functionalities. On the other hand, compound func-
tion words have a variety of functionalities that may
affect language analyses such as POS tagging and
parsing. In this work, we extract compound func-
tional expressions from the English part of Wik-
tionary, and classify their occurrences in PTB into
either literal or MWE usages. We then build a POS
tagger that takes MWEs into account. In implement-
ing this, we use CRFs that can handle a sequence of
tokens as a single item (Kudo et al, 2004). We eval-
uate the performance of the tagger and compare it
with the method that uses the BIO schema for iden-
tifying MWE usages (Constant and Sigogne, 2011).
3 MWEs Extraction from Wiktionary
To construct an English MWE dictionary, we extract
entries from the English part of Wiktionary (as of
July 14, 2012) that include white spaces. We ex-
tract only fixed expressions that are categorized ei-
ther as adverbs, conjunctions, determiners, prepo-
sitions, prepositional phrases or pronouns. We ex-
clude compound nouns and phrasal verbs since the
former are easily recognized by an existing method
such as chunking and the latter need more sophis-
ticated analyzing methods because of their syntac-
tic flexibility. We also exclude multiword adjec-
tives since many of them are semi-fixed and behave
differently from lexical adjective, having predica-
tive usage only. Table 1 summarizes the numbers
of MWE entries in Wiktionary and the numbers of
them that appear at least once in PTB.
4 Annotation of MWEs in PTB
While it is usually not easy to identify the usage of
an MWE as either an MWE or a literal usage, we
initially thought that the phrase structure tree an-
notations in PTB would have enough information
to identify their usages. This assumption is cor-
rect in many cases (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The
MWE usage of ?a bit? in Figure 1(a) is analyzed as
?NP-ADV?, suggesting it is used as an adverb, and
the literal usage of ?a bit? in Figure 1(b) is labeled
as ?NP?, suggesting it is used literally. However,
there are a number of examples that are annotated
differently while their usages are the same. For ex-
ample, Figures 1(c), 1(d) and 1(e) all show RB us-

Sometimes, the same structure tree is annotated to
instances of different usages (Figures 1(b) and 1(d)).
Therefore, for eachMWE candidate, we first clus-
ter its occurrences in PTB according to their phrase
tree structures. Some of the clusters clearly indi-
cate MWE usages (such as ?NP-ADV? trees in Fig-
ures 1(a) and 1(c)). In such cases, we regarded all in-
stances as MWE usages and annotated them as such.
For inconsistent or ambiguous cases (such as ?NP?
trees in Figures 1(b), 1(d) and 1(e)), we manually
classify each of them into either MWE or literal us-
age (some MWEs have multiple MWE usages). We
find a number of inconsistent POS annotations on
some internal words of MWEs (e.g. ?bit? in Fig-
ures 1(c) and 1(e) are annotated as RB while they
should be NN). We correct such inconsistent cases
(correction is only done on internal words of MWEs,
selecting the majority POS tags as correct). The total
number of POS tag corrections made on PTB (chap-
ter 00-24) was 1084.
2The POS tags in the trees are: RB(adverb), IN(preposition),
DT(determiner), NN(common noun) ...
5 Experiments of POS tagging and MWE
recognition
5.1 Experiment Setting
We conduct POS tagging experiments on the MWE-
annotated PTB, using sections 0-18 for training and
sections 22-24 for test as usual.
For the experiments, we use four versions of PTB
with the following POS annotations.
(a) Original: PTB with the original POS annota-
tion
(b) Revised: PTB with correction of inconsistent
POS tags
(c) BIO MWE: MWEs are annotated with the BIO
schema
(d) MWE: MWEs are annotated as single words
Concerning the MWE annotation in (c) and (d),
the total number of MWE tokens in PTB is 12131
(9417 in the training chapters, 1396 in the test
chapters, and 1319 for the remaining (development)
chapters).
Each word is annotated with the following in-
141
Figure 2: Example of lattice containing MWE (?about to/RB?) (correct path is marked with bold boxes.)
Table 2: Examples of MWE annotations in four versions
Version Word/POS
(a) Original about/RB to/TO
(b) Revised about/IN to/TO
(c) BIO MWE about/RB-B to/RB-I
(d) MWE about to/RB
formation: coarse-grained POS tag (CPOS), fine-
grained POS tag (FPOS) and surface form. Each
MWE is further annotated with its POS tag, surface
form, its internal words with their POS tags.
Table 2 shows sample annotations of MWE
?about to? in each of the four versions of PTB. In
(a), ?about/RB? is annotated incorrectly, which is
corrected in (b). In (c), ?-B? indicates the beginning
token of an MWE and ?-I? indicates an inside posi-
tion of an MWE. In (d), ?about to? is annotated as
an RB (we omit the POS tags for its internal words,
which are IN and TO).
We use a CRF-based tagger for training and test
on all the four PTB versions. Our CRF can han-
dle ?words with spaces? (e.g. ?about to? as a single
token as well as separated tokens) as shown in Fig-
ure 2. This extension is only relevant to the case of
the (d) MWE version.
Table 3 summarizes the set of feature templates
used in the experiments. In Table 3, ?Head POS?
means the POS tag of the beginning token of an
MWE. In the same way, ?Tail POS? means the POS
tag of the last token of an MWE. For example, for
?a lot of /DT?, its Head POS is DT and its Tail POS
is IN.
We evaluate POS tagging accuracy and MWE
recognition accuracy. In POS evaluation, each to-
ken receives a tag in the cases of (a), (b) and (c), so
the tagging accuracy is straightforwardly calculated.

In the case of (d), since MWEs are analyzed as sin-
gle words, they are expanded into the internal words
with their POS tags and the evaluated on the token
basis.
MWE recognition accuracy is evaluated for the
cases of (c) and (d). For the purpose of comparison,
we employ a simple baseline as well. This baseline
assigns each occurrence of an MWE its most fre-
quent usage in the training part of PTB. Evaluation
of MWE recognition accuracy is shown in precision,
recall and F-measure.
We use the standard set of features based on uni-
gram/bi-gram of words/POS. For our MWE version,
we add the word forms and POS tags of the first and
the last internal words of MWEs as shown in Ta-
ble 3.
5.2 Experimental Results
Table 4 shows the results of POS tagging. A slight
improvement is observed in (b) compared with (a)
because some of inconsistent tags are corrected.
Further improvement is achieved in (d). The exper-
iment on (c) does not show improvement even over
142

(a). The reason may attribute to the data sparseness
caused by the increased size of POS tags.
Table 5 shows the results of MWE recognition.
Our MWE-aware CRF model (d) shows the best re-
sults. While the BIO model (c) significantly outper-
forms the baseline, it gives significantly lower re-
sults than our model.
We investigated errors in (d) and categorized them
into three types.
? False Positive: System finds an MWE, while it
is actually literal.
? False Negative: System misses to identify an
MWE.
? Misrecognition: System finds an MWE
wrongly (correct answer is another MWE).
Table 6 shows number of recognition errors of
MWEs.
An example of the False Positive is ?a bit /RB? in
Figure 3, which actually is a literal usage and should
be tagged as ?a /DT, bit /NN?.
An example of the False Negative is ?in black and
white /RB?, which is not recognized as an MWE.
One reason of this type of errors is low or zero fre-
quency of such MWEs in training data. ?after all
/RB? (in Figure 3) is another False Negative exam-
ple.
Table 6: Recognition error of MWEs
Error types # of errors
False Positives 33
False Negatives 19
Misrecognition 17
One example of Misrecognition errors stems from
ambiguous MWEs. For example, while ?how much?
only has MWE usages as RB, there are two RB
usages of ?how much? that have different POS
tag sequences for the internal words. Other ex-
amples of Misrecognition are due to zero or low
frequency MWEs, whose substrings also matches
shorter MWEs: ?quite/RB, a few/PRP? while cor-
rect analysis is ?quite a few/RB?, and ?the hell /RB,
out of /IN? while the correct analysis is ?the hell out
of /RB?.
6 Conclusion and Future work
This paper presented our ongoing project for con-
struction of an English MWE dictionary, and its ap-
plication to MWE-aware POS tagging. The exper-
imental results show that the MWE-aware tagger
achieved better performance on POS tagging and
MWE recognition. Although our current MWE dic-
tionary only covers fixed types of functional MWEs,
this dictionary and MWE annotation information on
PTB will be made publicly available.
We plan to handle a wider range of MWEs such as
phrasal verbs and other semi-fixed and syntactically
flexible MWEs, and to develop a POS tagger and a
syntactic parser on top of them.
