INTRODUCTION 
These TIPSTER Phase III Proceedings bring 
to a close a program that had significant impact on 
information technology. Since 1991, the TIPSTER 
Text program has fostered the advancement of state- 
of-the-art technologies for text handling through the 
efforts of researchers and developers in the U.S. 
Government, industry and academia. The resulting 
capabilities are being deployed throughout the 
intelligence community to provide analysts with 
improved information processing tools. 
The TIPSTER Program focused on research 
and development in three technology areas: 
Document detection, information extraction and text 
summarization. In addition, the development of 
multilingual or cross-lingual capabilities in each of 
these areas became a vital component of the program. 
Metrics-based evaluations also constituted a critical 
program element. For example, the Text Retrieval 
Conference (TREC), TIPSTER's metrics-based 
evaluation for document detection is now recognized 
as the premier source of ground-truth data upon 
which information retrieval developers can test their 
systems. The TREC collection is a sizable one and 
provides the foundation for developers to test 
scalability of retrieval systems. The Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC), the Multilingual 
Entity Task (MET) and the Summarization Analysis 
Conference (SUMAC) also are TIPSTER evaluation 
mechanisms to help the Government gauge 
technology progress in relevant areas. 
A summary of the accomplishments for the 
first two phases of the TIPSTER program is provided 
in the sections below. For more details, please see 
the proceedings for TIPSTER Phase I \[1\] and 
TIPSTER Phase II \[2\], respectively. The next article 
in this volume \[3\] provides the highlights from Phase 
III, the last phase of the TIPSTER program. 
PHASE I ACCOMPL ISHMENTS 
The focus of TIPSTER Phase I was to 
advance the state of the art in two text-processing 
technologies, Document Detection and Information 
Extraction. Document detection included two 
subtasks: Routing (running static queries against a 
text stream) and ad hoc retrieval (running ad hoc 
queries against archival data). Information Extraction 
is a technology in which pre-specified types of 
information are located within free text, extracted and 
placed within such structured forms as templates 
which can be considered as pseudo-databases. 
The algorithm development in detection and 
extraction during Phase I resulted in improvements in 
the technologies. As a result of TIPSTER advances, 
detection users had: 
? Improved recall (the system retrieves more of the 
relevant documents available in the applicable 
document collection) 
? Improved precision (the system returns to the 
user a higher percentage of relevant documents 
in the "hits" list, meaning that the user will read 
fewer documents in order to find the one he 
wants) 
? Ranked retrievals (the user reviews documents 
statistically ranked according to how well they 
matched the query, thus improving the chances 
that the most relevant documents will be at the 
top of the hits list) 
? Query expansion (the system would attempt o 
automatically expand queries to draw in more 
relevant documents by using concept based tools 
such as thesauri) 
? Automatic query generation (the system uses a 
natural language description of the subject 
3 
supplied by the user, including example text, to 
generate queries) 
The TIPSTER Program continued Government 
sponsorship of information extraction research. The 
extraction efforts, begun with the DARPA-sponsored 
MUC in 1987. sought o reduce the burden of tasks 
largely characterized by manual procedures and large 
resource investments both in terms of people and 
corresponding dollars. As a result of extraction 
algorithm development in Phase I, systems could be 
developed with: 
? Increased scalability within a domain with 
reduced user involvement 
? Increased ease of portability to new domains and 
languages (Phase I focused on two domains and 
two languages.) 
? Greater task independence, solving multiple 
problems with reusable components. 
In addition, the advances improved the ability of 
systems to users with 
? Accurate and consistent database content results 
? Minimal user intervention in reviewing 
extraction results 
? Initial cost expenditures with reduced 
maintenance osts 
? Flexibility in managing the amount of 
information to be extracted 
? Applicability to new tasks such as text tagging 
and document detection support. 
PHASE I I  ACCOMPL ISHMENTS 
The Government continued its sponsorship 
of information technology in TIPSTER Phase II. The 
participating agencies defined a two-tiered program 
of continued algorithm development and transfer of 
technology into demonstration projects. The 
Government, industry and academia continued their 
close cooperation and, based on Phase I experiences, 
crafted a four-part program. (See Figure 1.) While 
continuing the traditional focus on advanced research 
and metrics-based valuation, the program supported 
the development of a common software architecture 
and applications of the technologies to help solve 
operational problems. 
While advances were continuing in the 
technology areas, there was a growing need for 
interoperability among the diverse systems. The 
impetus for the architecture came from an analysis of 
the designs of Phase I systems and analysis of 
operational scenarios that indicated the 
complementary nature of detection and extraction 
operations. The Government sponsors wanted an 
architecture that would support both technology 
TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 
Research on the two underlying technology areas: 
- Document detection (and the more general 
category of information retrieval) 
- Text extraction 
For Phase III of the program, 15 research contracts were 
executed. 
T IPSTER ARCHITECTURE 
A framework to enable sharing and interchangeability of 
software modules developed under the TIPSTER 
program. The architecture documents provided standards 
for basic software components and specifications for 
interfaces between two components. 
METRIC-BASED EVALUATIONS 
Development of evaluation methodologies and creation of 
data collections, with ground truth, to serve as the testbed 
for software systems in the three technology areas. The 
evaluations forums were: 
- Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) 
- Message Understanding Conference (MUC) 
- Multilingual Entity Task (MET) 
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS 
Projects funded independently b  various partner agencies 
to evaluate the technologies for transfer into the workplace. 
A total of 15 projects were executed in Phase II and several 
continued into Phase III.

areas. An architecture working group (AWG), 
consisting of TIPSTER Phase II R&D contractors, 
was formed to address the issues of developing a
common, open architecture. This architecture would 
provide the framework for interoperability between 
detection and extraction systems and for plug-and- 
play flexibility. The AWG, with the support of an 
independent System Engineering/Configuration 
Management contractor, drafted initial versions of a 
TIPSTER architecture. 
To test the feasibility of applying the 
TIPSTER-developed algorithms to operational 
environments, individual Government agencies 
sponsored separate development projects. For each 
of these projects, a demonstration system based on 
the architecture and modules developed in the R&D 
tier was developed. Some 15 systems were 
developed and tested in operational environments at
several Government agencies as a result of this effort. 
Identified needs for architecture and algorithm 
improvements or additional research were fed back to 
the R&D projects. 
The research and development efforts of the 
TIPSTER Program Phase II included improvements 
of algorithms and research into combining the results 
of the application of diverse extraction and detection 
techniques. There were improvements in detection 
recall and precision. Automatic query generation and 
relevance ranking spread beyond the TIPSTER 
Program and began to be common features in 
commercial search engines. Extraction technology 
advanced to the point that for at least one task, named 
entity extraction, machine performance was nearly the 
same as human performance. Extraction robustness 
had improved to allow operational users to test 
systems on real-world problems to determine that 
automatic population of databases was indeed 
possible with this technology. 
The program continued its primary 
sponsorship of both the Message Understanding 
Conferences and the Text Retrieval Conferences. 
This sponsorship was based on the belief that these 
forums for evaluation are essential to technology 
advances, synergistic interactions of conference 
participants and the continued success in TIPSTER 
research and development. The combined efforts of 
TIPSTER Phase I and Phase II effectively set the 
scene for the third--and final--phase of the 
TIPSTER Text Program.
