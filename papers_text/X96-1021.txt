1.0 Abstract 
TIPSTER is an ARPA sponsored program that 
seeks to develop methods and tools that support analysts 
in their efforts to filter, process, and analyze ever 
increasing quantities of text-based information. To this 
end, government sponsors, contractors, and developers 
are working to design an architecture specification that 
makes it possible for natural anguage processing tech- 
niques and tools, from a variety sources, to be inte- 
grated, shared, and configured by end-users. The 
Computing Research Laboratory (CRL) is a longtime 
contributor to TIPSTER. A significant portion of CRL's 
research involves work on a variety of natural language 
processing problems, human-computer interaction, and 
problems associated with getting technology into the 
hands of end-users. CRL is using TIPSTER technology 
to develop OLEADA, which is an integrated set of com- 
puter tools designed to support language learners, and 
instructors. Further, OLEADA has been developed 
using a task-oriented user-centered design methodology. 
This paper describes the methodology used to develop 
OLEADA and the current system's capabilities. 
2.0 TIPSTER and the Computing 
Research Laboratory 
Information extraction is a relatively new applica- 
tion of natural language processing techniques in which 
basic information and relationships are found and 
extracted from text. TIPSTER I was an effort to find 
electronic methods for information retrieval and infor- 
mation extraction.TIPSTER uses texts from a variety of 
sources including newspaper articles and wire service 
reports. The information TIPSTER I extracts resembles 
a completed form. The contents of a form is intended to 
be used to automatically generate specialized atabases 
for information analysts. The components developed for 
TIPSTER I enabled it to function in two languages (Jap- 
anese and English). 
TIPSTER II is a joint effort among many sites to 
develop working systems that integrate information 
retrieval and information extraction. The core of the 
project is a joint government/contractor committee 
whose goal is to specify an architecture for TIPSTER II. 
TIPSTER developers work to provide a variety of spe- 
cialized software subsystems that support TIPSTER 
development. These include: 
? Document managers that provide multi-source docu- 
ment compatibilities. 
? Translation subsystems that support retrieval of doc- 
uments in many languages, based on a query in one 
language. 
? Libraries of procedures for user interface support 
with embedded functionality for Information 
Retrieval and Information Extraction. 
? Advanced Motif-based multi-lingual user interface 
capabilities, upporting Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
Arabic and other writing systems. 
? Plug-and-play to integrate various kinds of software 
inside TIPSTER. 
The TIPSTER II architecture makes it possible to 
integrate a variety of information retrieval, extraction, 
and text processing systems in ways that help analysts 
address more complex problems. 
2.1 OLEADA:  Task-Or iented User-  
Centered Design in Natural  Language 
Process ing 
Researchers with the Computing Research Labora- 
tory (CRL) at New Mexico State University are inter- 
ested not only in theoretical spects of natural language 
processing, but methods for getting the results of this 
research into the hands of actual users. OLEADA, a 
project at CRL that seeks to develop computer tools that 
support language learners and instructors, has been 
developed with this goal in mind. OLEADA uses TIP- 
STER technology to provide users with access to perti- 
nent and authentic text, and tools for manipulating this 
text. It is based, in part, on Cibola, a system that sup- 
ports human translators by providing them with tools 
that directly support he translation task. Although task- 
oriented user-centered design is not new method for 
85 
application development, it has not previously been 
applied to natural language processing tasks. 
Working translators use a variety of resources that 
lend themselves to electronic storage and retrieval. 
These include monolingual and bilingual dictionaries 
and glossaries, large collections of source and target lan- 
guage text, and other lexical information. Language 
instructors search through large amounts of text to find 
authentic examples of language use in particular con- 
texts. Both user groups can benefit from the language 
analysis tools being developed under the TIPSTER pro- 
gram. 
Storage and retrieval of information in electronic 
databases can be more efficient than equivalent searches 
in their paper-based counterparts. Tobe useful for work- 
ing translators, methods for searching, retrieving, and 
presenting information must be done in ways that are 
familiar. Further, the current state-of-the-art in tradi- 
tional machine translation and programmed instruction 
provide inadequate support for language translators, 
learners, and instructors. Although TIPSTER technol- 
ogy does not immediately address these issues, it does 
provide the basis for new systems that can support 
humans working with language, and resources that can 
aid them in their work. 
3.0 Development Methodology 
There are many problems associated with develop- 
ing new technology to help with tasks previously solved 
with old technology. Often, new technology is not deliv- 
ered in a conveniently usable manner, and systems may 
not provide functions that are immediately useful to pro- 
fessionals. Usability or usefulness may not be the pri- 
mary concern of developers of new technology whose 
attention and creative nergies are rightly focused on the 
mechanisms of the software. Research in human-com- 
puter interaction suggests that a user-centered task-ori- 
ented approach is the most appropriate method for 
developing interfaces that deliver new technology to an 
existing workforce. 
CRL has employed a task--oriented user-centered 
approach to apply natural anguage technology to the 
design of interface software that supports working trans- 
lators, language learners, and instructors. The result of 
this work are the collection of tools OLEADA. Because 
the goal has been to get technology into the hands of 
users in ways that meet heir needs, CRL has focused on 
user testing that motivates feature development and sys- 
tem enhancements. 
3.1 Iterative Des ign and Part ic ipatory 
Prototyp ing 
The design methodology used for developing OLE- 
ADA, and its precursor Cibola, is one of iterative 
design, and the first step in this process is to understand 
the user through user-protocol task-analysis. User-proto- 
col task-analysis involves an empirical analysis of work- 
ers at their jobs, and has three goals. The first goal is to 
determine worker goals and their strategies for accom- 
plishing them. The second is to characterize workers 
tasks. The third is to identify cognitive bottlenecks. 
Participatory prototyping again focuses on users 
and their tasks. Here, designers observe users working, 
and involve users in the stem design process by having 
them work with early prototypes. User/designer discus- 
sions focus on real problems users are having working 
with the prototypes to accomplish real goals. A process 
of iterative refinement (user observation, participative- 
prototyping, and formative evaluations) ultimately 
shapes useful systems. 
Formative valuations are short, empirical design 
evaluation studies that focus on system improvement, 
not system validation. Here, users and developers can 
identify system problems and enhancements hat, if 
implemented, can significantly improve system usabil- 
ity. Fixing 'details' often leads to expected productivity 
gains. 
3.2 Exist ing Tools 
Many software tools already exist that could be use- 
ful to language translators, instructors, and learners. But 
because they are cumbersome and awkward to learn and 
use they often go unused by all except computer pro- 
grammers and developers. Examples include UNIX pro- 
grams like grep, editors like emacs that can support 
multilingual text, and programming languages like perl 
and, lisp, and prolog that can be used to manipulate text 
data. Most advanced language analysis tools, e.g. name 
recognizers/taggers, part-of-speech taggers, etc., also 
demand similar skills. To bring the power of these tools 
and others to language translators, instructors, and 
learners requires usable user interfaces that help users 
accomplish their tasks. 
4.0 Four Phases 
This section describes three iterations of the four 
step iterative design process used to develop OLEADA. 
These steps consist of user observations, task analysis, 
interface design, and participative prototyping that 
includes formative evaluations. Typically, research 
objectives drive research in natural language processing 
86 
(NLP). In the context of CRL's work in NLP, however, 
user observations and task analysis combine to define 
directions for additional NLP and user interface 
research and objectives. This is particularly true in the 
case of OLEADA. 
4.1 Phase One 
Phase one began with a study (user observation) of 
DoD analysts engaged in paper and pencil translation 
tasks. It was observed that translators working with pen- 
cil and paper tend to work with a source text alongside 
the translation i  progress rather than above or below it. 
During task analysis, it was noted that translators 
often use a variety of paper-based tools and resources 
like mono- and bilingual dictionaries, specialized glos- 
saries, and thesauri to aid them in the translation task. 
These translators would also spend significant amounts 
of time marking hardcopy, comparing source and target 
language texts, and consulting reference material. 
The initial interface design focused on methods for 
displaying, editing, and marking-up multilingual text, 
and the identification of tools and methods for accessing 
electronic equivalents of paper-based resources. These 
resources included dictionaries, glossaries, thesauri, and 
other data including translation memory (parallel- 
aligned source and target language text). 
The first prototype focused on Spanish and English 
text. The system's user interface technology included a 
'bookmark' tool so that users could keep track of 
searches in reference material, and an annotation tool 
that enabled users to highlight and attach comments to 
text. The need to have TIPSTER-style document man- 
agement for annotations and attributes became apparent 
early in the user/task analysis. CRL's multi-attributed 
text widget was used to provide users with facilities for 
editing and displaying text. NLP technology included a 
CRL developed Spanish morphology tool to enable 
sophisticated searches of on-line resources, and used 
lexical indexing for electronic dictionaries and thesauri. 
The system also contained a prototype translation mem- 
ory tool. 
4.2 Second Phase 
User observation for phase two consisted of users 
working with the prototype system on example tasks. 
Task analysis demonstrated that the system lacked func- 
tionality and resources. The Spanish morphology com- 
ponent was enhanced, and the alignment algorithm for 
translation memory was improved. Further improve- 
ments were made to the components for multilingual 
display and edit. 
The second prototype contained more resources, 
had improved ocument management, and was changed 
to a client/server a chitecture. More mono- and bilingual 
dictionaries were added, as was the CIA Chiefs-of-State 
database and a world gazetteer. Fuzzy matching was 
added to aid users in searches. 
4.3 Third Phase 
The users observed during the third phase were 
instructors who used the system to develop instructional 
material. Task analysis of their work showed that a large 
part of their effort consisted of gathering, retrieving, and 
analyzing text in context, and current, authentic texts 
were extremely useful. 
Changes to the system included the addition of 
CRL's concordance tool (X-Concord), improved multi- 
lingual information retrieval, and enhanced Chinese/ 
Japanese word identification and segmentation. 
5.0 OLEADA 
Currently, OLEADA provides a multi-windowed 
side-by-side presentation of source and target language 
texts (as opposed, for example, to the top-bottom pre- 
sentation of texts on some PC's) with editing capabili- 
ties in the target ext window. To support editing of text 
displayed in multiple languages, OLEADA utilizes 
CRL's multi-attributed text widget. This makes it possi- 
ble for OLEADA users to display and edit multilingual 
texts. Languages include those using Latin characters, 
Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and Russian. OLEADA also 
uses TUIT, CRL's TIPSTER user interface toolkit, and 
TDM, CRL's TIPSTER document manager. 
5.1 Text Display, Edit, and Annotations 
The OLEADA text editor makes it possible for 
users to display, edit, and annotate multilingual text. 
During the design process it was discovered that transla- 
tors often like to make notes on documents they are 
working on, either in the margins, on the lines them- 
selves, or by attaching notes to the document. To accom- 
modate this a TIPSTER annotation and document 
management feature was added to the system. Anno- 
tated text in Figure 1 appears as colored highlights on 
the computer screen, or as grayed text here. This feature 
enables users to make notes or annotations to a docu- 
ment on-line. Annotated text is color-highlighted, has 
attributes associated with it (such as 'author' or 'type', 
and can be categorized into groups. Annotations on doc- 
87 
uments automatically added by TIPSTER language 
analysis modules can also be viewed and changed 
through the same annotation tool. 
to text in another document. This feature is shown in 
Figure 2.

FIGURE 1. Annotated Text 
Highlighted text in an OLEADA document is simi- 
lar to highlighting text with a marker on paper. It draws 
attention to particular passages. Like writing in the mar- 
gin of a paper document, OLEADA has an annotation 
list interface that can be used to associate other text, 
either as input by the user, or by linking the annotation

5.2 Xconcord  
The XConcord program is a concordance tool that 
allows KWIC (Key Word In Context) searches to be 
done in text in as many as 17 languages. It is designed to 
be easy to work with so that teachers and students can 
use XConcord in the classroom to identify relevant texts

by viewing words and expressions in context. Searching 
is quick and the size of the corpus is limited only by 
available disk space. Using an implementation of the 
Boyer-Moore search algorithm specially adapted for 
wide characters, X-Concord can search at over 1MB per 
second, eliminating the need for pre-indexing on many 
moderate scale corpora. 
Searching is very flexible. Users can match any 
string with any part of a word or phrase. Users can also 
limit the search to only those concordances ither con- 
taining or missing specified strings in the context o the 
left or right of the keyword. 
Xconcord shows the results in a KWIC display and 
also, as seen in the smaller bottom window in Figure 3, 
the complete sentence for the selected KWIC line. The 
complete document is displayed in yet another window. 
Easy methods for saving individual sentences or com- 
plete documents o new text files are provided. The users 
can then edit these files or use Xconcord to print the 
results. 
5.3 The D ic t ionary  Inter face 
The interface to the OLEADA Dictionary resource 
includes multilingual access to headwords and their def- 
initions, and also provides users with examples of usage, 
part-of-speech information, etc. Further, translators 
often find valuable information by looking at the entries 
that are close to the target entry. Figure 4 shows the 
OLEADA Dictionary interface. 
Search Word Dictionary 
List List Entry 
FIGURE 4. The Dictionary Interface 
CRL's Dictionary tool provides users with an inte- 
grated and easily accessed interface to a wide variety of 
on-line fixed reference material. Our multilingual, 
multi-attribute X-Window text capability is used to for- 
mat this material to capture and reflect the original 
printed form, complete with all of the lexicographic 
markup, which makes these on-line resources at least as 
useful as their printed counterparts. The result is that 
language translators and learners can use their existing 
knowledge of how to use these dictionaries. Further, text 
is fully integrated with the windowing software so it is 
easy to copy and paste words and phases found in these 
resources directly into the user's target documents. 
A limited view of the headword list is provided. 
Headword lists consist primarily of the root form of a 
word, however searches can be performed using mor- 
phological variants. OLEADA has morphological naly- 
sis component hat enables the system to return 
information on morphological variants of a search term. 
In cases where similar spelling or morphological vari- 
ants are available, a fuzzy match list is provided that 
users can select from. 
The Dictionary tool's usability is also enhanced by 
its sophisticated lexical search capability. Word stem- 
ming, Spanish morphology, Chinese and Japanese word 
segmentation a d multiple codeset indexing all help to 
ensure that every lexical form related to the search term 
is found. The searches are fast, and all dictionaries are 
searched each time. This enables users to see which 
resources have relevant entries. Searches are automati- 
cally expanded by a fuzzy matching scheme if the initial 
search fails. Fuzzy expansion can be helpful in cases 
where the exact form of a search term is not known, or 
where you may not recall the spelling of term. A wild- 
card matching capability is also available. 
Dictionary resources in OLEADA are indexed 
alphabetically by word like their paper counterparts. 
There are several on-line dictionaries available. During 
a search all dictionaries are searched. If a match cannot 
be made in the current dictionary, but occurs in another 
dictionary that entry will be displayed. The dictionaries 
are easily-accessible and entries can be retrieved by sim- 
ply clicking on the dictionary button corresponding to
the desired ictionary. 
OLEADA's Dictionary interface also provides an 
alternate word list in addition to the headword list for 
words with multiple entries that match the morphologi- 
cal form of the search word, such as accented words or 
words with alternate spellings. Dictionary entries can be 
retrieved for one of these words by clicking on the word 
in the list. 
Unlike paper dictionaries, OLEADA's on-line dic- 
tionaries can be searched using partial words and/or 
wildcards. A wildcard character is one that can signify 
any letter and is represented by an asterisk (*). For 
89 
example, entries for words beginning with ma but end- 
ing with any letter could be found by entering ma*. The 
information returned consists of a fuzzy match list con- 
taining all of the words beginning with ma. 
5.4 Bookmarks 
When using paper-based resources, translators will 
often make references back to information they have 
previously found. To accommodate this OLEADA has a 
'Bookmark' feature that keeps a list of lexical items pre- 
viously found. Figure 5 shows the interface for this fea- 
ture.

FIGURE 5. The OLEADA Bookmark Window 
By selecting a resource and clicking on any of the 
entries in the search list a user can quickly return to pre- 
viously retrieved information. 
5.5 Word Frequency Tool 
CRL's Word Frequency tool provides users with a 
simple interface for viewing word statistics for individ- 
ual documents or large collections of documents. In 
addition, word frequencies in individual documents or 
smaller sub-collections can be automatically compared 
to larger collections to identify 'distinctive' words in the 
document that are significant with respect o the larger 
collection. This feature can be used to identify important 
"domain specific" words. By looking at the these fre- 
quency lists, a language analyst or instructor can 
improve their coverage and avoid missing prominent 
words. 
The word frequency tool also works with TIPSTER 
documents and collections and takes advantage of word 
segmentation a notations tocount Chinese and Japanese 
words. Documents and collections are processed 
quickly and results can be re-accessed though collection 
attributes. 
6.0 Conclusion 
The benefits of OLEADA are numerous. TIPSTER 
technology is being transferred in ways that give real 
users access to technology in useful ways. Machines are 
excellent tools for quickly searching for, retrieving, and 
storing information. Humans are good at using lan- 
guage. Through a process of task-oriented user-centered 
design and iterative refinement, computer tools have 
been developed that take advantage of the strengths of 
machines to support he strengths of humans. OLEADA 
provides users with a consistent, networked medium for 
working with multilingual text and integrates analysis 
tools using the TIPSTER architecture. 
More importantly, OLEADA offers an informa- 
tional technology alternative to traditional anguage 
instruction. It enables adult professionals, all of whom 
use informational technology on the job, to access perti- 
nent and authentic materials, perform motivated tasks, 
and select a range of performance support ools. Learn- 
ers proceed like researchers as they direct and manage 
their own training, not only in the classroom but also on 
the job. Instructors can use OLEADA to support all 
phases of language training.
