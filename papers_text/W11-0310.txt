Abstract
Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973))
postulate that women?s language styles differ
from that of men. In this paper, we explore
statistical techniques that can learn to iden-
tify the gender of authors in modern English
text, such as web blogs and scientific papers.
Although recent work has shown the efficacy
of statistical approaches to gender attribution,
we conjecture that the reported performance
might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic
factors such as topic bias in gender that can
make the gender detection task easier. Our
work is the first that consciously avoids gender
bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evi-
dence to gender-specific styles in language be-
yond topic. In addition, our comparative study
provides new insights into robustness of var-
ious stylometric techniques across topic and
genre.
1 Introduction
Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973)) postu-
late that women?s language styles differ from that
of men with respect to various aspects of communi-
cation, such as discourse behavior, body language,
lexical choices, and linguistic cues (e.g., Crosby
and Nyquist (1977), Tannen (1991), Argamon et al
(2003), Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (2003), Arga-
mon et al (2007)). In this paper, we explore statis-
tical techniques that can learn to identify the gen-
der of authors in modern English text, such as web
blogs and scientific papers, motivated by sociolin-
guistic theories for gender attribution.
There is a broad range of potential applications
across computational linguistics and social science
where statistical techniques for gender attribution
can be useful: e.g., they can help understanding de-
mographic characteristics of user-created web text
today, which can provide new insight to social sci-
ence as well as intelligent marketing and opinion
mining. Models for gender attribution can also help
tracking changes to gender-specific styles in lan-
guage over different domain and time. Gender de-
tectors can be useful to guide the style of writing as
well, if one needs to assume the style of a specific
gender for imaginative writing.
Although some recent work has shown the effi-
cacy of machine learning techniques to gender at-
tribution (e.g., Koppel et al (2002), Mukherjee and
Liu (2010)), we conjecture that the reported perfor-
mance might be overly optimistic under scrutiny due
to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender
that can make the gender detection task easier. In-
deed, recent research on web blogs reports that there
is substantial gender bias in topics (e.g., Janssen and
Murachver (2004), Argamon et al (2007)) as well
as in genre (e.g., Herring and Paolillo (2006)).
In order to address this concern, we perform the
first comparative study of machine learning tech-
niques for gender attribution after deliberately re-
moving gender bias in topics and genre. Further-
more, making the task even more realistic (and chal-
lenging), we experiment with cross-topic and cross-
genre gender attribution, and provide statistical ev-
idence to gender-specific styles in language beyond
topic and genre. Five specific questions we aim to
investigate are:
78
Q1 Are there truly gender-specific characteristics
in language? or are they confused with gender
preferences in topics and genre?
Q2 Are there deep-syntactic patterns in women?s
language beyond words and shallow patterns?
Q3 Which stylometric analysis techniques are ef-
fective in detecting characteristics in women?s
language?
Q4 Which stylometric analysis techniques are ro-
bust against domain change with respect to top-
ics and genre?
Q5 Are there gender-specific language characteris-
tics even in modern scientific text?
From our comparative study of various techniques
for gender attribution, including two publicly avail-
able systems - Gender Genie1 and Gender Guesser2
we find that (1) despite strong evidence for deep
syntactic structure that characterizes gender-specific
language styles, such deep patterns are not as robust
as shallow morphology-level patterns when faced
with topic and genre change, and that (2) there are
indeed gender-specific linguistic signals that go be-
yond topics and genre, even in modern and scientific
literature.
2 Related Work
The work of Lakoff (1973) initiated the research on
women?s language, where ten basic characteristics
of women?s language were listed. Some exemplary
ones are as follows:
1 Hedges: e.g., ?kind of?, ?it seems to be?
2 Empty adjectives: e.g., ?lovely?, ?adorable?,
?gorgeous?
3 Hyper-polite: e.g., ?would you mind ...?, ?I?d
much appreciate if ...?
4 Apologetic: e.g., ?I am very sorry, but I think
that ...?
5 Tag questions: e.g., ?you don?t mind, do you??

2Available at http://www.hackerfactor.com/
GenderGuesser.php
Many sociolinguists and psychologists consequently
investigated on the validity of each of the above
assumptions and extended sociolinguistic theo-
ries on women?s language based on various con-
trolled experiments and psychological analysis (e.g.,
Crosby and Nyquist (1977), McHugh and Ham-
baugh (2010)).
While most theories in socioliguistics and psy-
chology focus on a small set of cognitively identi-
fiable patterns in women?s language (e.g., the use of
tag questions), some recent studies in computer sci-
ence focus on investigating the use of machine learn-
ing techniques that can learn to identify women?s
language from a bag of features (e.g., Koppel et al
(2002), Mukherjee and Liu (2010)).
Our work differs from most previous work in
that we consciously avoid gender bias in topics and
genre in order to provide more accurate analysis
of statistically identifiable patterns in women?s lan-
guage. Furthermore, we compare various techniques
in stylometric analysis within and beyond topics and
genre.
3 Dataset without Unwanted Gender Bias
In this section, we describe how we prepared our
dataset to avoid unwanted gender bias in topics and
genre. Much of previous work has focused on for-
mal writings, such as English literature, newswire
articles and the British Natural Corpus(BNC) (e.g.,
Argamon et al (2003)), while recent studies ex-
panded toward more informal writing such as web
blogs (e.g., Mukherjee and Liu (2010)). In this
work, we chose two very different and prominent
genre electronically available today: web blogs and
scientific papers.
Blogs: We downloaded blogs from popular blog
sites for 7 distinctive topics:3 education, travel, spir-
ituality, entertainment, book reviews, history and
politics. Within each topic, we find 20 articles writ-
ten by male authors, and additional 20 articles writ-
ten by female authors. We took the effort to match
articles written by different gender even at the sub-
topic level. For example, if we take a blog written
about the TV show ?How I met your mother? by a
female author, then we also find a blog written by a
3wordpress.com, blogspot.com & nytimes.
com/interactive/blogs/directory.html
79
male author on the same show. Note that previous
research on web blogs does not purposefully main-
tain balanced topics between gender, thereby bene-
fiting from topic bias inadvertently. From each blog,
we keep the first 450 (+/- 20) words preserving the
sentence boundaries.4 We plan to make this data
publically available.
Scientific Papers: Scientific papers have not been
studied in previous research on gender attribution.
Scientific papers correspond to very formal writ-
ing where gender-specific language styles are not
likely to be conspicuous (e.g., Janssen and Mu-
rachver (2004)).
For this dataset, we collected papers from the re-
searchers in our own Natural Language Processing
community. We randomly selected 5 female and 5
male authors, and collected 20 papers from each au-
thor. We tried to select these authors across a variety
of subtopics within NLP research, so as to reduce
potential topic-bias in gender even in research. It is
also worthwhile to mention that authors in our selec-
tion are highly established ones who have published
over multiple subtopics in NLP.
Similarly as the blog dataset, we keep the first
450 (+/- 20) words preserving the sentence bound-
aries. Some papers are co-authored by researchers
of mixed gender. In those cases, we rely on the gen-
der of the advisory person as she or he is likely to
influence on the abstract and intro the most.
4 Statistical Techniques
In this section, we describe three different types of
statistical language models that learn patterns at dif-
ferent depth. The first kind is based on probabilis-
tic context-free grammars (PCFG) that learn deep
long-distance syntactic patterns (Section 4.1). The
second kind is based on token-level language mod-
els that learn shallow lexico-syntactic patterns (Sec-
tion 4.2). The last kind is based on character-level
language models that learn morphological patterns
on extremely short text spans (Section 4.3). Fi-
nally, we describe the bag-of-word approach using
the maximum entropy classifier (Section 4.4).
4Note that existing gender detection tools require a mini-
mum 300 words for appropriate identification.
4.1 Deep Syntactic Patterns using
Probabilistic Context free Grammar
A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) cap-
tures syntactic regularities beyond shallow ngram-
based lexico-syntactic patterns. Raghavan et al
(2010) recently introduced the use of PCFG for au-
thorship attribution for the first time, and demon-
strated that it is highly effective for learning stylistic
patterns for authorship attribution. We therefore ex-
plore the use of PCFG for gender attribution. We
give a very concise description here, referring to
Raghavan et al (2010) for more details.
(1) Train a generic PCFG parser Go on manually
tree-banked corpus such as WSJ or Brown.
(2) Given training corpus D for gender attribution,
tree-bank each training document di ? D using
the PCFG parser Go.
(3) For each gender ?, train a new gender-specific
PCFG parser G? using only those tree-banked
documents in D that correspond to gender ?.
(4) For each test document, compare the likelihood
of the document determined by each gender-
specific PCFG parser G? , and the gender cor-
responding to the higher score.
Note that PCFG models can be considered as a kind
of language models, where probabilistic context-
free grammars are used to find the patterns in lan-
guage, rather than n-grams. We use the implementa-
tion of Klein and Manning (2003) for PCFG models.
4.2 Shallow Lexico-Syntactic Patterns using
Token-level Language Models
Token-based (i.e. word-based) language models
have been employed in a wide variety of NLP ap-
plications, including those that require stylometric
analysis, e.g., authorship attribution (e.g., Uzner and
Katz (2005)), and Wikipedia vandalism detection
(Wang and McKeown, 2010). We expect that token-
based language models will be effective in learning
shallow lexico-syntactic patterns of gender specific
language styles. We therefore experiment with un-
igram, bigram, and trigram token-level models, and
name them as TLM(n=1), TLM(n=2), TLM(n=3),
respectively, where TLM stands for Token-based

Language Models. We use the LingPipe package5
for experiments.
4.3 Shallow Morphological Patterns using
Character-level Language Models
Next we explore the use of character-level lan-
guage models to investigate whether there are mor-
phological patterns that characterize gender-specific
styles in language. Despite its simplicity, previ-
ous research have reported that character-level lan-
guage models are effective for authorship attribu-
tion (e.g., Peng et al (2003b)) as well as genre
classification (e.g., Peng et al (2003a), Wu et al
(2010)). We experiment with unigram, bigram,
and trigram character-level models, and name them
as CLM(n=1), CLM(n=2), CLM(n=3), respectively,
where CLM stands for Character-based Language
Models. We again make use of the LingPipe pack-
age for experiments.
Note that there has been no previous research
that directly compares the performance of character-
level language models to that of PCFG based models
for author attribution, not to mention for gender at-
tribution.
4.4 Bag of Words using
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) Classifier
We include Maximum Entropy classifier using sim-
ple unigram features (bag-of-words) for comparison
purposes, and name it as ME. We use the MALLET
package (McCallum, 2002) for experiments.
5 Experimental Results
Note that our two datasets are created to specifically
answer the following question: are there gender-
specific characteristics in language beyond gender
5Available at http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/
preferences in topics and genre? One way to answer
this question is to test whether statistical models can
detect gender attribution on a dataset that is dras-
tically different from the training data in topic and
genre. Of course, it is a known fact that machine
learning techniques do not transfer well across dif-
ferent domains (e.g., Blitzer et al (2006)). However,
if they can still perform considerably better than ran-
dom prediction, then it would prove that there is in-
deed gender-specific stylometric characteristics be-
yond topic and genre. In what follows, we present
five different experimental settings across two differ-
ent dataset to compare in-domain and cross-domain
performance of various techniques for gender attri-
bution.
5.1 Experiments with Blog Dataset
First we conduct two different experiments using the
blog data in the order of increasing difficulty.
[Experiment-I: Balanced Topic] Using the web
blog dataset introduced in Section 3, we perform
gender attribution (classification) task on balanced
topics. For each topic, 80% of the documents are
used for training and remaining ones are used for
testing, yielding 5-fold cross validation. Both train-
ing and test data have balanced class distributions
so that random guess would yield 50% of accuracy.
The results are given in Table 1. Note that the ?over-
all accuracy? corresponds to the average across the
five folds.
The PCFG model achieves prediction accuracy
64.1%, demonstrating statistical evidence to gender-
specific characteristics in syntactic structure. The
PCFG model outperforms two publicly available
systems - Gender Genie and Gender Guesser, which
are based on a fixed list of indicator words. The dif-
ference is statistically significant (p = 0.01 < 0.05)

Table 2: Per-Topic & Per-Gender Accuracy of Cross-Topic Gender Attribution on Blog Data (Experiment-II)
using paired student?s t-test.6
Interestingly, the best performing approaches are
character-level language models, performing sub-
stantially better (71.30% for n=2) than both the
token-level language models (66.1% for n=2) and
the PCFG model (64.10%). The difference between
CLM(n=2) and PCFG is statistically significant (p =
0.015 < 0.05) using paired student?s t-test, while the
difference between TLM(n=2) and PCFG is not.
6We also experimented with the interpolated PCFG model
following Raghavan et al (2010) using various interpolation
dataset, but we were not able to achieve a better result in our
experiments. We omit the results of interpolated PCFG models
for brevity.
As will be seen in the following experiment
(Experiment-II) using the Blog dataset as well, the
performance of PCFG models is very close to that
of unigram language models. As a result, one might
wonder whether PCFG models are learning any use-
ful syntactic pattern beyond terminal productions
that can help discriminating gender-specific styles in
language. This question will be partially answered
in the fourth experiment (Experiment-IV) using
the Scientific Paper dataset, where PCFG models
demonstrate considerably better performance over
the unigram language models.
Following Raghavan et al (2010), we also exper-

imented with ensemble methods that linearly com-
bine the output of different classifiers, but we omit
the results in Table 1, as we were not able to ob-
tain consistently higher performance than the simple
character-level language models in our dataset.
[Experiment-II: Cross-Topic] Next we perform
cross-topic experiments using the same blog dataset,
in order to quantify the robustness of different tech-
niques against topic change. We train on 6 topics,
and test on the remaining 1 topic, making 7-fold
cross validation. The results are shown in Table 2,
where the top one third shows the performance for
all authors, the next one third shows the performance
with respect to only female authors, the bottom one
third shows the performance with respect to only
male authors.
Again, the best performing approaches are based
on character-level language models, achieving upto
68.3% in accuracy. PCFG models and token-level
language models achieve substantially lower accu-
racy of 59.0% and 61.5% respectively. Per-gender
analysis in Table 1 reveals interesting insights into
different approaches. In particular, we find that
Gender Genie and Gender Guesser are biased to-
ward male authors, attributing the majority authors
as male. PCFG and ME on the other hand are bi-
ased toward female authors. Both character-level
and token-level language models show balanced dis-
tribution between gender. We also experimented
with ensemble methods, but omit the results as we
were not able to obtain higher scores than simple
character-level language models.
From these two experiments so far, we find that
PCFG models and word-level language models are
neither as effective, nor as robust as character-level
language models for gender attribution. Despite
overall low performance of PCFG models, this re-
sult suggests that PCFG models are able to learn
gender-specific syntactic patterns, albeit the signals
from deep syntax seem much weaker than those of
very shallow morphological patterns.
5.2 Experiments with Scientific Papers
Next we present three different experiments using
the scientific data, in the order of decreasing diffi-
culty.
[Experiment-III: Cross-Topic & Cross-Genre]
In this experiment, we challenge statistical tech-
niques for gender attribution by changing both top-
ics and genre across training and testing. To do so,
we train models on the blog dataset and test on the
scientific paper dataset. Notice that this is a dramati-
cally harder task than the previous two experiments.
Note also that previous research thus far has not
reported experiments such as this, or even like the
previous one. It is worthwhile to mention that our
goal in this paper is not domain adaptation for gen-
der attribution, but merely to quantify to what degree
the gender-specific language styles can be traced
across different topics and genre, and which tech-
niques are robust against domain change.
The results are shown in Table 5. Precisely as ex-
pected, the performance of all models drop signif-
icantly in this scenario. The two baseline systems
? Gender Genie and Gender Guesser, which are not
designed for formal scientific writings also perform
worse in this dataset. Table 4 discussed in the next
experiment will provide more insight into this by
providing per-gender accuracy of these baseline sys-
tems.
From this experiment, we find a rather surprising
message: although the performance of most statis-
tical approaches decreases significantly, notice that
most approaches perform still better than random
(50%) prediction, achieving upto 61.5% accuracy.

Table 4: Per-Author Accuracy of Cross-Topic Gender Attribution for Scientific Papers (Experiment-IV)
Considering that the models are trained on dras-
tically different topics and genre, this result sug-
gests that there are indeed gender-specific linguis-
tic signals beyond different topics and genre. This
is particularly interesting given that scientific papers
correspond to very formal writing where gender-
specific language styles are not likely to be conspic-
uous (e.g., Janssen and Murachver (2004)).
[Experiment-IV: Cross-Topic] Next we perform
cross-topic experiment, only using the scientific pa-
per dataset. Because the stylistic difference in genre
is significantly more prominent than the stylistic dif-
ference in topics, this should be a substantially eas-
ier task than the previous experiment. Nevertheless,
previous research to date has not attempted to eval-
uate gender attribution techniques across different
topics. Here we train on 4 authors per gender (8 au-
thors in total), and test on the remaining 2 authors,
making 5-fold cross validation. As before, the class
distributions are balanced in both training and test
data.
The experimental results are shown in Table 4,
where we report per-author, per-gender, and overall
average accuracy. As expected, the overall perfor-
mance increase dramatically, as models are trained
on articles in the same genre. It is interesting to
see how Gender Genie and Gender Guesser are ex-
tremely biased toward male authors, achieving al-
most zero accuracy with respect to articles written
by female authors. Here the best performing models
are PCFG and CLM(n=3), both achieving 76.0% in
accuracy. Token-level language models on the other
hand achieve significantly lower performance.
Remind that in the first two experiments based
on the blog data, PCFG models and token-level lan-
guage models performed similarly. Given that, it is
very interesting that PCFG models now perform just
as good as character-level language models, while
outperforming token-level language models signifi-
cantly. We conjecture following two reasons to ex-
plain this:
? First, scientific papers use very formal lan-
guage, thereby suppressing gender-specific lex-
ical cues that are easier to detect (e.g., empty
words such as ?lovely?, ?gorgeous? (Lakoff,
1973)). In such data, deep syntactic patterns
play a much stronger role in detecting gender
specific language styles. This also indirectly

Table 5: Overall Accuracy of Topic-Balanced Gender Attribution on Scientific Papers (Experiment-V)
addresses the concern raised in Experiment-I
& II as to whether the PCFG models are learn-
ing any syntactic pattern beyond terminal pro-
ductions that are similar to unigram language
models.
? Second, our dataset is constructed in such a
way that the training and test data do not share
articles written by the same authors. Further-
more, the authors are chosen so that the main
research topics are substantially different from
each other. Therefore, token-based language
models are likely to learn topical words and
phrases, and suffer when the topics change dra-
matically between training and testing.
[Experiment-V: Balanced Topic] Finally, we
present the conventional experimental set up, where
topic distribution is balanced between training and
test dataset. This is not as interesting as the previous
two scenarios, however, we include this experiment
in order to provide a loose upper bound. Because
we choose each different author from each different
sub-topic of research, we need to split articles by the
same author into training and testing to ensure bal-
anced topic distribution. We select 80% of articles
from each author as training data, and use the re-
maining 20% as test data, resulting in 5-fold cross
validation.
This is the easiest task among the three exper-
iments using the scientific paper data, hence the
performance increases substantially. As before,
character-level language models perform the best,
with CLM n=3 reaching extremely high accuracy
of 91.50%. All other statistical approaches perform
very well achieving at least 85% or higher accuracy.
Note that token-level language models perform
very poorly in the previous experimental setting,
while performing close to the top performer in this
experiment. We make the following two conclusions
based on the last two experiments:
? Token-level language models have the ten-
dency of learning topics words, rather than just
stylometric cues.
? When performing cross-topic gender attribu-
tion (as in Experiment-IV), PCFG models are
more robust than token-level language models.
6 Conclusions
We postulate that previous study in gender attribu-
tion might have been overly optimistic due to gen-
der specific preference on topics and genre. We per-
form the first comparative study of machine learn-
ing techniques for gender attribution consciously re-
moving gender bias in topics. Rather unexpect-
edly, we find that the most robust approach is based
on character-level language models that learn mor-
phological patterns, rather than token-level language
models that learn shallow lexico-syntactic patterns,
or PCFG models that learn deep syntactic patterns.
Another surprising finding is that we can trace sta-
tistical evidence of gender-specific language styles
beyond topics and genre, and even in modern scien-
tific papers.
