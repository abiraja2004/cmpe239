Abstract
This paper describes research on parsing
Tagalog text for predicate?argument structure
(PAS). We first outline the linguistic phe-
nomenon and corpus annotation process, then
detail a series of PAS parsing experiments.
1 Introduction
Predicate?argument structure (PAS) has been
shown to be highly valuable in tasks such as infor-
mation extraction (Surdeanu et al, 2003; Miyao et
al., 2009). In this research, we develop a resource for
analysing the predicate?argument structure of Taga-
log, a free word order language native to the Philip-
pines, and carry out preliminary empirical investiga-
tion of PAS parsing methods over Tagalog.
The motivation for this research is the investiga-
tion of the interaction between information structure
and word order in Tagalog. That is, we wish to de-
termine the utility of discourse-based contextual in-
formation in predicting word order in Tagalog, in a
natural language generation context. We see PAS as
the natural representation for this exploration. This
research clearly has implications beyond our imme-
diate interests, however, in terms of resource cre-
ation for an NLP resource-poor language, and the
facilitation of research on parsing and parsing-based
applications in Tagalog. It is also one of the first in-
stances of research on PAS parsing over a genuinely
free word order language.
2 Background
Tagalog is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-
Polynesian branch, which forms the basis of the na-
tional language of the Philippines, Filipino (a.k.a.
Pilipino) (Gordon, 2005). It is a verb-initial lan-
guage, with relatively free word order of verbal
arguments (Kroeger, 1993), as exemplified in the
word-order variants provided with (1). There are
no discernible meaning differences between the pro-
vided variants, but there are various soft constraints
on free word order, as discussed by Kroeger (1993)
and Sells (2000).

In addition to these free word order possibilities,
Tagalog exhibits voice marking, a morpho-syntactic
phenomenon which is common in Austronesian lan-
guages and gives prominence to an element in a sen-
tence (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Kroeger, 1993).
This poses considerable challenges to generation,
because of the combinatorial explosion in the pos-
sible ways of expressing what is seemingly the same
proposition. Below, we provide a brief introduction
to Tagalog syntax, with particular attention to voice
marking.
2.1 Constituency
There are three case markers in Tagalog: ang, ng
and sa, which are by convention written as separate
preposing words, as in (1). These markers normally
prepose phrasal arguments of a given verb.
The sa marker is predominantly used for goals,
recipients, locations and definite objects, while ng
marks possessors, actors, instruments and indefinite
objects (Kroeger, 1993). Ang is best explained in
terms of Tagalog?s voice-marking system.

2.2 Tagalog Voice Marking
Tagalog has rich verbal morphology which gives
prominence to a particular dependent via voice
marking (Schachter and Otanes, 1972); this special
dependent in the sentence is the ang-marked argu-
ment.
There are 5 major voice types in Tagalog: Ac-
tor Voice (AV); Patient/Object Voice (OV); Da-
tive/Locative Voice (DV); Instrumental Voice (IV);
and Benefactive Voice (BV) (Kroeger, 1993). This
voice marking, manifested on the verb, reflects the
semantic role of the ang-marked constituent, as seen
in the sentences below from Kroeger (1993), illus-
trating the 3 voice types of AV, OV, and BV.

In each case, the morphological marking on the verb
(which indicates the voice type) is presented in bold,
along with the focused ang argument.
In addition to displaying free word order, there-
fore, Tagalog presents the further choice of which
voice to encode the proposition with.
3 Data and Resources
For this research, we annotated our own corpus of
Tagalog text for PAS. This is the first such resource
to be created for the Tagalog language. To date,
we have marked up two chapters (about 2500 to-
kens) from a narrative obtained from the Guten-
berg Project1 called Hiwaga ng Pagibig (?The Mys-
tery of Love?); we intend to expand the amount of

annotated data in the future. The annotated data
is available from www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/
research/lt/resources/tagalog-pas.
3.1 Part-of-speech Mark-up
First, we developed a set of 5 high-level part-of-
speech (POS) tags for the task, with an additional
tag for sundries such as punctuation. The tags are as
follows:
Description Example(s)
proper name names of people/cities
pronoun personal pronouns
open-class word nouns, verbs, adjectives
closed-class word conjunctions
function word case markers
other punctuation
These tags are aimed at assisting the identification
of constituent boundaries, focusing primarily on dif-
ferentiating words that have semantic content from
those that perform a grammatical function, with the
idea that function words, such as case markers, gen-
erally mark the start of an argument, while open-
class words generally occur within a predicate or ar-
gument. Closed-class words, on the other hand (e.g.
sentence conjuncts) tend not to be found inside pred-
icates and arguments.
The advantage of having a coarse-grained set of
tags is that there is less margin for error and dis-
agreement on how a word can be tagged. For future
work, we would like to compare a finer-grained set
of tags, such as that employed by dela Vega et al
(2002), with our tags to see if a more detailed dis-
tinction results in significant benefits.
In Section 4, we investigate the impact of the in-
clusion of this extra annotation on PAS recogni-
tion, to gauge whether the annotation effort was war-
ranted.
3.2 Predicate and Argument Mark-up
Next, we marked up predicates and their (core) argu-
ments, employing the standard IOB tag scheme. We
mark up two types of predicates: PRD and PRD-SUB.
The former refers to predicates that belong to main
clauses, whilst the latter refers to predicates that oc-
cur in subordinate or dependent clauses.
We mark up 4 types of arguments: ANG, NG,
SA and NG-COMP. The first three mark nominal
258
phrases, while the last marks sentential comple-
ments (e.g. the object of quotative verbs).
We follow the multi-column format used in
the CoNLL 2004 semantic role labelling (SRL)
task (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004), with as many
columns as there are predicates in a sentence, and
one predicate and its associated arguments per col-
umn.
3.3 Annotation
Our corpus consists of 259 predicates (47 of which
are subordinate, i.e. PRD-SUB), and 435 arguments.
The following is a breakdown of the arguments:
Argument type: SA ANG NG NG-CMP
Count: 83 193 147 12
3.4 Morphological Processing
In tandem with the corpus annotation, we developed
a finite-state morphological analyser using XFST and
LEXC (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), that extracts
morphological features for individual words in the
form of a binary feature vector.2 While LEXC is or-
dinarily used to define a lexicon of word stems, we
opted instead to list permissible syllables, based on
the work of French (1988). This decision was based
purely on resource availability: we did not have an
extensive list of stems in Tagalog, or the means to
generate such a list.
4 Experiments
In this section, we report on preliminary results for
PAS recognition over our annotated data. The ap-
proach we adopt is similar to the conventional ap-
proach adopted in CoNLL-style semantic role la-
belling: a two-phase approach of first identifying the
predicates, then identifying arguments and attaching
them to predicates, in a pipeline architecture. Pri-
mary areas of investigation in our experiments are:
(1) the impact of POS tags on predicate prediction;
and (2) the impact of morphological processing on
overall performance.
In addition to experimenting with the finite state
morphological processing (see Section 3.4), we ex-
periment with a character n-gram method, where we
simply take the first and last n characters of a word
2Thanks to Steven Bird for help with infixation and defining
permissible syllables for the morphological analyser
as features. In our experiments, we set n to 3 and 2
characters for prefix and suffixes, respectively.
We treat each step in the pipeline as a structured
learning task, which we model with conditional ran-
dom fields (Lafferty et al, 2001) using CRF++.3
All of the results were arrived at via leave-one-out
cross-validation, defined at the sentence level, and
the evaluation was carried out in terms of precision
(P), recall (R) and F-score (F) using the evaluation
software from the CoNLL 2004 SRL task.
4.1 Predicate identification
First, we attempt to identify the predicate(s) in a
given sentence. Here, we experiment with word
context windows of varying width (1?6 words),
and also POS features in the given context win-
dow. Three different strategies are used to derive
the POS tags: (1) from CRF++, with a word bi-
gram context window of width 3 (AUTO1); (2) again
from CRF++, with a word bigram context window
of width 1 (AUTO2); and (3) from gold-standard
POS tags, sourced from the corpus (GOLD). AUTO1
and AUTO2 were the two best-performing POS tag-
ging methods amongst a selection of configurations
tested, both achieving a word accuracy of 0.914.
We compare these three POS tagging options with
a method which uses no POS tag information (NO
POS). The results for the different POS taggers with
each word context width size are presented in Ta-
ble 1.
Our results indicate that the optimal window size
for the predicate identification is 5 words. We also
see that POS contributes to the task, and that the rel-
ative difference between the gold-standard POS tags
and the best of the automatic POS taggers (AUTO2)
is small. Of the two POS taggers, the best per-
formance for AUTO2 is clearly superior to that for
AUTO1.
4.2 Argument Identification and Attachment
We next turn to argument identification and attach-
ment, i.e. determining the word extent of arguments
which attach to each predicate identified in the first
step of the pipeline. Here, we build three predicate
recognisers from Section 4.1: NO POS, AUTO2 and

GOLD, all based on a window size of 5. We com-
bine these with morphological features from: (1) the
finite-state morphological analyser, (2) character n-
grams, and (3) the combination of the two. The re-
sults of the different combinations are shown in Ta-
ble 2, all based on a word context window of 3, as
this was found to be superior for the task in all cases.
The results with character n-grams were in all
cases superior to those for the morphological anal-
yser, although slight gains were seen when the two
were combined in most cases (most notably in re-
call). There was surprisingly little difference be-
tween the GOLD results (using gold-standard POS
tags) and the AUTO2 results.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a system that recog-
nises PAS in Tagalog text. As part of this, we cre-
ated the first corpus of PAS for Tagalog, and pro-
duced preliminary results for predicate identification
and argument identification and attachment.
In future work, we would like to experiment with
larger datasets, include semantic features, and trial
other learners amenable to structured learning tasks.
