Abstract
OBJECTIVE: The prior knowledge about
the rhetorical structure of scientific abstracts
is useful for various text-mining tasks such
as information extraction, information re-
trieval, and automatic summarization. This
paper presents a novel approach to cate-
gorize sentences in scientific abstracts into
four sections, objective, methods, results,
and conclusions. METHOD: Formalizing
the categorization task as a sequential label-
ing problem, we employ Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs) to annotate section la-
bels into abstract sentences. The train-
ing corpus is acquired automatically from
Medline abstracts. RESULTS: The pro-
posed method outperformed the previous
approaches, achieving 95.5% per-sentence
accuracy and 68.8% per-abstract accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The experimental results
showed that CRFs could model the rhetor-
ical structure of abstracts more suitably.
1 Introduction
Scientific abstracts are prone to share a similar
rhetorical structure. For example, an abstract usu-
ally begins with the description of background in-
formation, and is followed by the target problem,
solution to the problem, evaluation of the solution,
and conclusion of the paper. Previous studies ob-
served the typical move of rhetorical roles in sci-
entific abstracts: problem, solution, evaluation, and
conclusion (Graetz, 1985; Salanger-Meyer, 1990;
Swales, 1990; Ora?san, 2001). The American Na-
tional Standard Institute (ANSI) recommends au-
thors and editors of abstracts to state the purpose,
methods, results, and conclusions presented in the
documents (ANSI, 1979).
The prior knowledge about the rhetorical structure
of abstracts is useful to improve the performance of
various text-mining tasks. Marcu (1999) proposed
an extraction method for summarization that cap-
tured the flow of text, based on Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST). Some extraction methods make
use of cue phrases (e.g., ?in conclusion?, ?our in-
vestigation has shown that ...?), which suggest that
the rhetorical role of sentences is to identify im-
portant sentences (Edmundson, 1969; Paice, 1981).
We can survey the problems, purposes, motivations,
and previous approaches of a research field by read-
ing texts in background sections of scientific papers.
Tbahriti (2006) improved the performance of their
information retrieval engine, giving more weight to
sentences referring to purpose and conclusion.
In this paper, we present a supervised machine-
learning approach that categorizes sentences in sci-
entific abstracts into four sections, objective, meth-
ods, results, and conclusions. Figure 1 illustrates
the task of this study. Given an unstructured ab-
stract without section labels indicated by boldface
type, the proposed method annotates section labels
of each sentence. Assuming that this task is well
formalized as a sequential labeling problem, we use
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al,
2001) to identify rhetorical roles in scientific ab-
stracts.The proposed method outperforms previous
approaches to this problem, achieving 95.5% per-

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the role of adrenergic signal transmission in the control of renal erythropoietin (EPO) pro-
duction in humans. METHODS: Forty-six healthy male volunteers underwent a hemorrhage of 750 ml. After phlebotomy, they
received (intravenously for 6 hours in a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled and single-blind design) either placebo (0.9%
sodium chloride), or the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist fenoterol (1.5 microgram/min), or the beta 1-adrenergic receptor ago-
nist dobutamine (5 micrograms/kg/min), or the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (loading dose of 0.14
mg/kg over 20 minutes, followed by 0.63 micrograms/kg/min). RESULTS: The AUCEPO(0-48 hr)fenoterol was 37% higher (p ?
0.03) than AUCEPO(0-48 hr)placebo, whereas AUCEPO(0-48 hr)dobutamine and AUCEPO(0-48 hr)propranolol were comparable
with placebo. Creatinine clearance was significantly increased during dobutamine treatment. Urinary cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate excretion was increased only by fenoterol treatment, whereas serum potassium levels were decreased. Plasma renin activity
was significantly increased during dobutamine and fenoterol infusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows in a model of con-
trolled, physiologic stimulation of renal erythropoietin production that the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist fenoterol but not the
beta 1-adrenergic receptor agonist dobutamine is able to increase erythropoietin levels in humans. The result can be interpreted as
a hint that signals for the control of erythropoietin production may be mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors rather than by beta
1-adrenergic receptors. It appears to be unlikely that an increase of renin concentrations or glomerular filtration rate is causally
linked to the control of erythropoietin production in this experimental setting.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes previous approaches to this task. For-
malizing the task as a sequential-labeling problem,
Section 3 designs a sentence classifier using CRFs.
Training corpora for the classifier are acquired au-
tomatically from the Medline abstracts. Section 4
reports considerable improvements in the proposed
method over the baseline method using Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). We
conclude this paper in Section 5.
2 Related Work
The previous studies regarded the task of identify-
ing section names as a text-classification problem
that determines a label (section name) for each sen-
tence. Various classifiers for text categorization,
Na??ve Bayesian Model (NBM) (Teufel and Moens,
2002; Ruch et al, 2007), Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) (Wu et al, 2006; Lin et al, 2006), and Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) (McKnight and Arini-
vasan, 2003; Shimbo et al, 2003; Ito et al, 2004;
Yamamoto and Takagi, 2005) were applied.
Table 1 summarizes these approaches and perfor-
mances. All studies target scientific abstracts except
for Teufel and Moens (2002) who target scientific
full papers. Field classes show the set of section
names that each study assumes: background (B),
objective/aim/purpose (O), method (M), result (R),
conclusion (C), and introduction (I) that combines
the background and objective. Although we should
not compare directly the performances of these stud-
ies, which use a different set of classification labels
and evaluation corpora, SVM classifiers appear to
yield better results for this task. The rest of this sec-
tion elaborates on the previous studies with SVMs.
Shimbo et al (2003) presented an advanced text
retrieval system for Medline that can focus on a
specific section in abstracts specified by a user.
The system classifies sentences in each Medline ab-
stract into four sections, objective, method, results,
and conclusion. Each sentence is represented by
words, word bigrams, and contextual information of
the sentence (e.g., class of the previous sentence,
relative location of the current sentence). They
reported 91.9% accuracy (per-sentence basis) and
51.2% accuracy (per-abstract basis1) for the clas-
sification with the best feature set for quadratic
SVM. Ito et al (2004) extended the work with a
semi-supervised learning technique using transduc-
tive SVM (TSVM).
Yamamoto and Takagi (2005) developed a sys-
tem to classify abstract sentences into five sections,
background, purpose, method, result, and conclu-
sion. They trained a linear-SVM classifier with fea-
tures such as unigram, subject-verb, verb tense, rel-
ative sentence location, and sentence score (average
TF*IDF score of constituent words). Their method
achieved 68.9%, 63.0%, 83.6%, 87.2%, 89.8% F-
scores for classifying background, purpose, method,
result, and conclusion sentences respectively. They
also reported the classification performance of intro-
duction sentences, which combines background and
purpose sentences, with 91.3% F-score.

are correctly labeled.

3 Proposed method
3.1 Section identification as a sequence labeling
problem
The previous work saw the task of labeling as a text
categorization that determines the class label yi for
each sentence xi. Even though some work includes
features of the surrounding sentences for xi, e.g.
?class label of xi?1 sentence,? ?class label of xi+1
sentence,? and ?unigram in xi?1 sentence,? the clas-
sifier determines the class label yi for each sentence
xi independently. It has been an assumption for text
classification tasks to decide a class label indepen-
dently of other class labels.
However, as described in Section 1, scientific ab-
stracts have typical moves of rhetorical roles: it
would be very peculiar if result sentences appear-
ing before method sentences were described in an
abstract. Moreover, we would like to model the
structure of abstract sentences rather than model-
ing just the section label for each sentence. Thus,
the task is more suitably formalized as a sequence
labeling problem: given an abstract with sentences
x = (x1, ..., xn), determine the optimal sequence of
section names y = (y1, ..., yn) of all possible se-
quences.
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been
successfully applied to various NLP tasks includ-
ing part-of-speech tagging (Lafferty et al, 2001) and
shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003). CRFs de-
fine a conditional probability distribution p(y|x) for
output and input sequences, y and x,
p(y|x) =
1
Z?(x)
exp {? ? F (y,x)} . (1)
Therein: function F (y,x) denotes a global feature
vector for input sequence x and output sequence y,
F (y,x) =
?
i
f(y,x, i), (2)
i ranges over the input sequence, function f(y,x, i)
is a feature vector for input sequence x and output
sequence y at position i (based on state features and
transition features), ? is a vector where an element
?k represents the weight of feature Fk(y,x), and
Z?(x) is a normalization factor,
Z?(x) =
?
y
exp {? ? F (y,x)} . (3)
The optimal output sequence y? for an input se-
quence x,
y? = argmax
y
p(y|x), (4)
is obtained efficiently by the Viterbi algorithm. The
optimal set of parameters ? is determined efficiently
by the Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) (Darroch
and Ratcliff, 1972) or Limited-memory Broyden-
Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) (Nocedal and
Wright, 1999) method.
3.2 Features
We design three kinds of features to represent each
abstract sentence for CRFs. The contributions of
these features will be evaluated later in Section 4.
Content (n-gram) This feature examines the exis-
tence of expressions that characterize a specific sec-
tion, e.g. ?to determine ...,? and ?aim at ...? for stat-
ing the objective of a study. We use features for sen-
tence contents represented by: i) words, ii) word bi-
grams, and iii) mixture of words and word bigrams.
Words are normalized into their base forms by the
GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005), which
is a part-of-speech tagger trained for the biomedical

domain. We measure the co-occurrence strength (?2
value) between each feature and section label. If a
feature appears selectively in a specific section, the
?2 value is expected to be high. Thus, we extract the
top 200,000 features2 that have high ?2 values to re-
duce the total number of features. Table 3.2 shows
examples of the top five bigrams that have high ?2
values.
Relative sentence location An abstract is likely to
state objective of the study at the beginning and its
conclusion at the end. The position of a sentence
may be a good clue for determining its section la-
bel. Thus, we design five binary features to indicate
relative position of sentences in five scales.
Features from previous/next w sentences This
reproduces features from previous and following w
sentences to the current sentence (w = {0, 1, 2}),
so that a classifier can make use of the content of
the surrounding sentences. Duplicated features have
prefixes (e.g. PREV_ and NEXT_) to distinguish
their origins.
3.3 Section labels
It would require much effort and time to prepare a
large amount of abstracts annotated with section la-
bels. Fortunately, some Medline abstracts have sec-
tion labels stated explicitly by its authors. We ex-
amined section labels in 7,811,582 abstracts in the
whole Medline3, using the regular-expression pat-
tern:
?[A-Z]+([ ][A-Z]+){0,3}:[ ]
A sentence is qualified to have a section name if it
begins with up to 4 uppercase token(s) followed by

periments.

a colon ?:?. This pattern identified 683,207 (ca. 9%)
abstracts with structured sections.
Table 3 shows typical moves of sections in Med-
line abstracts. The majority of sequences in this
table consists of four sections compatible with the
ANSI standard, purpose, methods, results, and con-
clusions. Moreover, the most frequent sequence
is ?OBJECTIVE ? METHOD(S) ? RESULTS
? CONCLUSION(S),? supposing that AIM and
PURPOSE are equivalent to OBJECTIVE. Hence,
this study assumes four sections, OBJECTIVE,
METHOD, RESULTS, and CONCLUSIONS.
Meanwhile, it is common for NP chunking tasks
to represent a chunk (e.g., NP) with two labels,
the begin (e.g., B-NP) and inside (e.g., I-NP) of
a chunk (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). Although
none of the previous studies employed this repre-
sentation, attaching B- and I- prefixes to section la-
bels may improve a classifier by associating clue
phrases (e.g., ?to determine?) with the starts of sec-
tions (e.g., B-OBJECTIVE). We will compare clas-
sification performances on two sets of label repre-
sentations: namely, we will compare four section
labels and eight labels with BI prefixes attached to
section names.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Experiment
We constructed two sets of corpora (?pure? and ?ex-
panded?), each of which contains 51,000 abstracts
sampled from the abstracts with structured sections.
The ?pure? corpus consists of abstracts that have the
exact four section labels. In other words, this cor-
pus does not include AIM or PURPOSE sentences
even though they are equivalent to OBJECTIVE sen-
tences. The ?pure? corpus is useful to compare the
performance of this study with the previous work.

bels found in the Medline. The ?expanded? corpus
is close to the real situation in which the proposed
method annotates unstructured abstracts.

Table 6: Classification performance (accuracy) on ?expanded? corpus (n = 10, 000)
measured the classification accuracy of sentences
(per-sentence accuracy) and abstracts (per-abstract
accuracy). In per-abstract accuracy, an abstract is
considered correct if all constituent sentences are
correctly labeled.
Trained with n = 50, 000 abstracts from ?pure?
corpus, the proposed method achieved 95.5% per-
sentence accuracy and 68.8% per-abstract accuracy.
The F-score for each section label was 98.7% (O),
95.8% (M), 95.0% (R), and 94.2% (C). The pro-
posed method performed this task better than the
previous studies by a great margin. Figure 2 shows
the training curve for the ?pure? corpus with all fea-
tures presented in this paper. CRF and SVM meth-
ods performed better with more abstracts used for
training. This training curve demonstrated that, with
less than half the number of training corpus, the pro-
posed method could achieve the same accuracy as
the baseline method.
Tables 5 and 6 report the performance of the
proposed and baseline methods on ?pure? and ?ex-
panded? corpora respectively (n = 10, 000). These
tables show per-sentence accuracy followed by per-
abstract accuracy in parentheses with different con-
figurations of features (row) and label representa-
tions (column). For example, the proposed method
obtained 94.3% per-sentence accuracy and 62.9%
per-abstract accuracy with 10,000 training abstracts
from ?pure? corpus, all features, and BI prefixes for
class labels.
The proposed method outperformed the baseline
method in all experimental configurations. This
suggests that CRFs are more suitable for modeling
moves of rhetorical roles in scientific abstracts. It
is noteworthy that the CRF classifier gained higher
per-abstract accuracy than the SVM. For example,
both the CRF classifier with features from surround-
ing sentences (w = 1), and SVM classifier with full
features, obtained 93.3% per-sentence accuracy in
Table 5. Nevertheless, the per-abstract accuracies of
the former and latter were 60.4% and 55.5% respec-
tively: the CRF classifier had roughly 5% advantage
on per-abstract accuracy over SVM. This analysis
reflects the capability of CRFs to determine the op-
timal sequence of section names.
Additional features such as sentence position and
surrounding sentences improved the performance by
ca. 5?10%. The proposed method achieved the best
results with all features. Another interesting discus-
sion arises with regard to the representations of sec-
tion labels. The BI representation always boosted
the per-abstract accuracy of CRF classifiers by ca.
4?14%. In contrast, the SVM classifier could not
leverage the BI representation, and in some configu-
rations, even degraded the accuracy.

5 Conclusion
This paper presented a novel approach to identifying
rhetorical roles in scientific abstracts using CRFs.
The proposed method achieved more successful re-
sults than any other previous reports. The CRF clas-
sifier had roughly 5% advantage on per-abstract ac-
curacy over SVM. The BI representation of section
names also boosted the classification accuracy by
5%. In total, the proposed method gained more than
10% improvement on per-abstract accuracy.
We have evaluated the proposed method only on
medical literatures. In addition to improving the
classification performance, a future direction for this
study would be to examine the adaptability of the
proposed method to include other types of texts. We
are planning to construct a summarization system
using the proposed method.
