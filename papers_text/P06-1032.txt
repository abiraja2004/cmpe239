Abstract 
This paper presents a pilot study of the 
use of phrasal Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) techniques to identify and 
correct writing errors made by learners of 
English as a Second Language (ESL). 
Using examples of mass noun errors 
found in the Chinese Learner Error Cor-
pus (CLEC) to guide creation of an engi-
neered training set, we show that applica-
tion of the SMT paradigm can capture er-
rors not well addressed by widely-used 
proofing tools designed for native speak-
ers. Our system was able to correct 
61.81% of mistakes in a set of naturally-
occurring examples of mass noun errors 
found on the World Wide Web, suggest-
ing that efforts to collect alignable cor-
pora of pre- and post-editing ESL writing 
samples offer can enable the develop-
ment of SMT-based writing assistance 
tools capable of repairing many of the 
complex syntactic and lexical problems 
found in the writing of ESL learners. 
1 Introduction 
Every day, in schools, universities and busi-
nesses around the world, in email and on blogs 
and websites, people create texts in languages 
that are not their own, most notably English. Yet, 
for writers of English as a Second Language 
(ESL), useful editorial assistance geared to their 
needs is surprisingly hard to come by. Grammar 
checkers such as that provided in Microsoft 
Word have been designed primarily with native 
speakers in mind. Moreover, despite growing 
demand for ESL proofing tools, there has been 
remarkably little progress in this area over the 
last decade. Research into computer feedback for 
ESL writers remains largely focused on small-
scale pedagogical systems implemented within 
the framework of CALL (Computer Aided Lan-
guage Learning) (Reuer 2003; Vanderventer 
Faltin, 2003), while commercial ESL grammar 
checkers remain brittle and difficult to customize 
to meet the needs of ESL writers of different 
first-language (L1) backgrounds and skill levels.  
  Some researchers have begun to apply statis-
tical techniques to identify learner errors in the 
context of essay evaluation (Chodorow & Lea-
cock, 2000; Lonsdale & Strong-Krause, 2003), to 
detect non-native text (Tomokiyo & Jones, 2001), 
and to support lexical selection by ESL learners 
through first-language translation (Liu et al, 
2000). However, none of this work appears to 
directly address the more general problem of 
how to robustly provide feedback to ESL writ-
ers?and for that matter non-native writers in 
any second language?in a way that is easily tai-
lored to different L1 backgrounds and second-
language (L2) skill levels.  
In this paper, we show that a noisy channel 
model instantiated within the paradigm of Statis-
tical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al, 
1993) can successfully provide editorial assis-
tance for non-native writers. In particular, the 
SMT approach provides a natural mechanism for 
suggesting a correction, rather than simply 
stranding the user with a flag indicating that the 
text contains an error. Section 2 further motivates 
the approach and briefly describes our SMT sys-
tem. Section 3 discusses the data used in our ex-
periment, which is aimed at repairing a common 
type of ESL error that is not well-handled by cur-
rent grammar checking technology: mass/count 
noun confusions. Section 4 presents experimental 
results, along with an analysis of errors produced 
by the system. Finally we present discussion and 
some future directions for investigation.

2 Error Correction as SMT 
2.1 Beyond Grammar Checking 
A major difficulty for ESL proofing is that errors 
of grammar, lexical choice, idiomaticity, and 
style rarely occur in isolation. Instead, any given 
sentence produced by an ESL learner may in-
volve a complex combination of all these error 
types. It is difficult enough to design a proofing 
tool that can reliably correct individual errors; 
the simultaneous combination of multiple errors 
is beyond the capabilities of current proofing 
tools designed for native speakers. Consider the 
following example, written by a Korean speaker 
and found on the World Wide Web, which in-
volves the misapplication of countability to a 
mass noun:  
 
And I knew many informations 
about Christmas while I was 
preparing this article. 
 
The grammar and spelling checkers in Microsoft 
Word 2003 correctly suggest many ? much 
and informations ? information. 
Accepting these proposed changes, however, 
does not render the sentence entirely native-like. 
Substituting the word much for many leaves 
the sentence stilted in a way that is probably un-
detectable to an inexperienced non-native 
speaker, while the use of the word knew repre-
sents a lexical selection error that falls well out-
side the scope of conventional proofing tools. A 
better rewrite might be: 
 
And I learned a lot of in-
formation about Christmas 
while I was preparing this 
article. 
 
or, even more colloquially: 
 
And I learned a lot about 
Christmas while I was pre-
paring this article 
 
Repairing the error in the original sentence, 
then, is not a simple matter of fixing an agree-
ment marker or substituting one determiner for 
another. Instead, wholesale replacement of the 
phrase knew many informations with 
the phrase learned a lot is needed to pro-
duce idiomatic-sounding output. Seen in these 
terms, the process of mapping from a raw, ESL-
authored string to its colloquial equivalent looks 
remarkably like translation. Our goal is to show 
that providing editorial assistance for writers 
should be viewed as a special case of translation. 
Rather than learning how strings in one language 
map to strings in another, however, ?translation? 
now involves learning how systematic patterns of 
errors in ESL learners? English map to corre-
sponding patterns in native English    
2.2 A Noisy Channel Model of ESL Errors 
If ESL error correction is seen as a translation 
task, the task can be treated as an SMT problem 
using the noisy channel model of (Brown et al, 
1993): here the L2 sentence produced by the 
learner can be regarded as having been corrupted 
by noise in the form of interference from his or 
her L1 model and incomplete language models 
internalized during language learning. The task, 
then, is to reconstruct a corresponding valid sen-
tence of L2 (target). Accordingly, we can seek to 
probabilistically identify the optimal correct tar-
get sentence(s) T* of an ESL input sentence S by 
applying the familiar SMT formula: 
 
( ){ }
{ })P()|P(maxarg
|Pmaxarg*
TTS
STT
T
T
=
=
 
In the context of this model, editorial assis-
tance becomes a matter of identifying those seg-
ments of the optimal target sentence or sentences 
that differ from the writer?s original input and 
displaying them to the user. In practice, the pat-
terns of errors produced by ESL writers of spe-
cific L1 backgrounds can be captured in the 
channel model as an emergent property of train-
ing data consisting ESL sentences aligned with 
their corrected edited counterparts. The highest 
frequency errors and infelicities should emerge 
as targets for replacement, while lesser frequency 
or idiosyncratic problems will in general not sur-
face as false flags. 
2.3 Implementation 
In this paper, we explore the use of a large-scale 
production statistical machine translation system 
to correct a class of ESL errors. A detailed de-
scription of the system can be found in (Menezes 
& Quirk 2005) and (Quirk et al, 2005). In keep-
ing with current best practices in SMT, our sys-
tem is a phrasal machine translation system that 
attempts to learn mappings between ?phrases? 
(which may not correspond to linguistic units) 
rather than individual words. What distinguishes 
250
this system from other phrasal SMT systems is 
that rather than aligning simple sequences of 
words, it maps small phrasal ?treelets? generated 
by a dependency parse to corresponding strings 
in the target. This ?Tree-To-String? model holds 
promise in that it allows us to potentially benefit 
from being able to access a certain amount of 
structural information during translation, without 
necessarily being completely tied to the need for 
a fully-well-formed linguistic analysis of the in-
put?an important consideration when it is 
sought to handle ungrammatical or otherwise ill-
formed ESL input, but also simultaneously to 
capture relationships not involving contiguous 
strings, for example determiner-noun relations.  
In our pilot study, this system was em-
ployed without modification to the system archi-
tecture. The sole adjustment made was to have 
both Source (erroneous) and Target (correct) sen-
tences tokenized using an English language to-
kenizer. N-best results for phrasal alignment and 
ordering models in the decoder were optimized 
by lambda training via Maximum Bleu, along the 
lines described in (Och, 2003).  
3 Data Development 
3.1 Identifying Mass Nouns 
In this paper, we focus on countability errors as-
sociated with mass nouns. This class of errors 
(involving nouns that cannot be counted, such as 
information, pollution, and home-
work) is characteristically encountered in ESL 
writing by native speakers of several East Asian 
languages (Dalgish, 1983; Hua & Lee, 2004).1 
We began by identifying a list of English nouns 
that are frequently involved in mass/count errors 
in by writing by Chinese ESL learners, by taking 
the intersection of words which: 
? occurred in either the Longman Dictionary 
of Contemporary English or the American 
Heritage Dictionary with a mass sense 
? were involved in n ? 2 mass/count errors in 
the Chinese Learner English Corpus 
CLEC (Gui and Yang, 2003), either tagged 
as a mass noun error or else with an adja-
cent tag indicating an article error.2  
                                                 
1
 These constructions are also problematic for hand-
crafted MT systems (Bond et al, 1994). 
2
 CLEC tagging is not comprehensive; some common 
mass noun errors (e.g., make a good progress) 
are not tagged in this corpus. 
This procedure yielded a list of 14 words: 
knowledge, food, homework, fruit, 
news, color, nutrition, equipment, 
paper, advice, haste, information, 
lunch, and tea. 3   Countability errors in-
volving these words are scattered across 46 sen-
tences in the CLEC corpus.   
For a baseline representing the level of writing 
assistance currently available to the average ESL 
writer, we submitted these sentences to the 
proofing tools in Microsoft Word 2003. The 
spelling and grammar checkers correctly identi-
fied 21 of the 46 relevant errors, proposed one 
incorrect substitution (a few advice ? a few 
advices), and failed to flag the remaining 25 
errors. With one exception, the proofing tools 
successfully detected as spelling errors incorrect 
plurals on lexical items that permit only mass 
noun interpretations (e.g., informations), 
but ignored plural forms like fruits and pa-
pers even when contextually inappropriate. The 
proofing tools in Word 2003 also detected singu-
lar determiner mismatches with obligatory plural 
forms (e.g. a news).  
3.2 Training Data 
The errors identified in these sentences provided 
an informal template for engineering the data in 
our training set, which was created by manipulat-
ing well-formed, edited English sentences. Raw 
data came from a corpus of ~484.6 million words 
of Reuters Limited newswire articles, released 
between 1995 and 1998, combined with a 
~7,175,000-word collection of articles from mul-
tiple news sources from 2004-2005. The result-
ing dataset was large enough to ensure that all 
targeted forms occurred with some frequency. 
From this dataset we culled about 346,000 
sentences containing examples of the 14 targeted 
words. We then used hand-constructed regular 
expressions to convert these sentences into 
mostly-ungrammatical strings that exhibited 
characteristics of the CLEC data, for example:  
? much ? many: much advice ? 
many advice  
? some ? a/an: some advice ? 
an advice  
? conversions to plurals: much good 
advice ? many good advices  
                                                 
3
 Terms that also had a function word sense, such as 
will, were eliminated for this experiment.  
251
? deletion of counters: piece(s)/ 
item(s)/sheet(s) of)  
? insertion of determiners  
These were produced in multiple combinations 
for broad coverage, for example: 
 
I'm not trying to give you 
legal advice. ? 
? I'm not trying to give you a 
legal advice. 
? I'm not trying to give you 
the legal advice. 
? I'm not trying to give you 
the legal advices. 
A total of 24128 sentences from the news data 
were ?lesioned? in this manner to create a set of 
65826 sentence pairs. To create a balanced train-
ing set that would not introduce too many arti-
facts of the substitution (e.g., many should not 
always be recast as much just because that is the 
only mapping observed in the training data), we 
randomly created an equivalent number of iden-
tity-mapped pairs from the 346,000 examples, 
with each sentence mapping to itself. 
Training sets of various sizes up to 45,000 
pairs were then randomly extracted from the le-
sioned and non-lesioned pairs so that data from 
both sets occurred in roughly equal proportions.  
Thus the 45K data set contains approximately 
22,500 lesioned examples. An additional 1,000 
randomly selected lesioned sentences were set 
aside for lambda training the SMT system?s or-
dering and replacement models. 
4  Evaluation 
4.1 Test Data 
The amount of tagged data in CLEC is too small 
to yield both development and test sets from the 
same data. In order to create a test set, we had a 
third party collect 150 examples of the 14 words 
from English websites in China. After minor 
cleanup to eliminate sentences irrelevant to the 
task,4 we ended up with 123 example sentences 
to use as test set. The test examples vary widely 
in style, from the highly casual to more formal 
public announcements. Thirteen examples were 
determined to contain no errors relevant to our 
experiment, but were retained in the data.5  
4.2 Results 
Table 1 shows per-sentence results of translating 
the test set on systems built with training data 
sets of various sizes (given in thousands of sen-
tence pairs). Numbers for the proofing tools in 
Word 2003 are presented by way of comparison, 
with the caveat that these tools have been inten-
tionally implemented conservatively so as not to 
potentially irritate native users with false flags. 
For our purposes, a replacement string is viewed 
as correct if, in the view of a native speaker who 
might be helping an ESL writer, the replacement 
would appear more natural and hence potentially 
useful as a suggestion in the context of that sen-
tence taken in isolation. Number disagreement 
on subject and verb were ignored for the pur-
poses of this evaluation, since these errors were 
not modeled when we introduced lesions into the 
data. A correction counted as Whole if the sys-
tem produced a contextually plausible substitu-
tion meeting two criteria: 1) number and 2) de-
terminer/quantifier selection (e.g., many in-
formations ? much information). 
Transformations involving bare singular targets 
(e.g., the fruits ? fruit) also counted 
as Whole.  Partial corrections are those where 
only one of the two criteria was met and part of 
the desired correction was missing (e.g., an 
                                                 
4
 In addition to eliminating cases that only involved 
subject-verb number agreement, we excluded a small 
amount of spam-like word salad, several instances of 
the word homework being misused to mean ?work 
done out of the home?, and one misidentified quota-
tion from Scott?s Ivanhoe.

equipments ? an equipment versus the 
targeted bare noun equipment). Incorrect sub-
stitutions and newly injected erroneous material 
anywhere in the sentence counted as New Errors, 
even if the proposed replacement were otherwise 
correct. However, changes in upper and lower 
case and punctuation were ignored.  
The 55.28% per-sentence score for Whole 
matches in the system trained on the 45K data set 
means that it correctly proposed full corrections 
in 61.8% of locations where corrections needed 
to be made. The percentage of Missed errors, i.e., 
targeted errors that were ignored by the system, 
is correspondingly low. On the 45K training data 
set, the system performs nearly on a par with 
Word in terms of not inducing corrections on 
forms that did not require replacement, as shown 
in the Correctly Left column.  The dip in accu-
racy in the 30K sentence pair training set is an 
artifact of our extraction methodology: the rela-
tively small lexical set that we are addressing 
here appears to be oversensitive to random varia-
tion in the engineered training data. This makes 
it difficult to set a meaningful lower bound on 
the amount of training data that might be needed 
for adequate coverage. Nonetheless, it is evident 
from the table, that given sufficient data, SMT 
techniques can successfully offer corrections for 
a significant percentage of cases of the phenom-
ena in question.  
Table 2 shows some sample inputs together 
with successful corrections made by the system. 
Table 3 illustrates a case where two valid correc-
tions are found in the 5-best ranked translations; 
intervening candidates were identical with the 
top-ranked candidate.   
4.3 Error Analysis 
Table 1 also indicates that errors associated with 
the SMT system itself are encouragingly few. A 
small number of errors in word order were found, 
one of which resulted in a severely garbled sen-
tence in the 45K data set. In general, the percent-
age of this type of error declines consistently 
with growth of the training data size. Linearity of 
the training data may play a role, since the sen-
tence pairs differ by only a few words. On the 
whole, however, we expect the system?s order 
model to benefit from more training data.  
The most frequent single class of newly intro-
duced error relates to sporadic substitution of the 
word their for determiners a/the. This is 
associated with three words, lunch, tea, and 
haste, and is the principal contributor to the 
lower percentages in the Correctly Left bin, as 
compared with Word. This overgeneralization 
error reflects our attempt to engineer the discon-
tinuous mapping the X of them ? their 
X, motivated by examples like the following, 
encountered in the CLEC dataset: 
Input Shanghai residents can buy the fruits for a cheaper price than before.  
Replacement Shanghai residents can buy fruit for a cheaper price than before . 
Input Thank u for giving me so many advice. 
Replacement thank u for giving me so much advice . 
Input Acquiring the knowledge of information warfare is key to 
winning wars 
Replacement acquiring knowledge of information warfare is key to win-
ning wars 
Input Many knowledge about Li Bai can be gain through it. 
Replacement much knowledge about Li Bai can be gain through it . 
Input I especially like drinking the tea. 
Replacement i especially like drinking tea . 
Input Icons printed on a paper have been brought from Europe, 
and were pasted on boards on Taiwan. 
Replacement icons printed on paper have been brought from Europe , and 
were pasted on boards on Taiwan .

In this equal world, lots of 
people are still concerned 
on the colors of them ? 
 
The inability of our translation system to handle 
such discontinuities in a unitary manner reflects 
the limited ability of current SMT modeling 
techniques to capture long-distance effects. Simi-
lar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., 
ne?pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable 
prefixes in German (Collins et al 2005). As 
SMT models become more adept at modeling 
long-distance effects in a principled manner, 
monolingual proofing will benefit as well. 
The Missed category is heterogeneous. The 
SMT system has an inherent bias against deletion, 
with the result that unwanted determiners tended 
not to be deleted, especially in the smaller train-
ing sets.  
Other errors related to coverage in the devel-
opment data set. Several occurrences of green-
grocer?s apostrophes (tea?s, equipment?s) 
caused correction failures: these were not antici-
pated when engineering the training data. Like-
wise, the test data presented several malformed 
quantifiers and quantifier-like phrases (plenty 
tea ? plenty of tea, a lot infor-
mation ? a lot of information, 
few information ? too little in-
formation) that had been unattested in the 
development set. Examples such as these high-
light the difficulty in obtaining complete cover-
age when using handcrafted techniques, whether 
to engineer errors, as in our case, or to handcraft 
targeted correction solutions.    
The system performed poorly on words that 
commonly present both mass and count noun 
senses in ways that are apt to confuse L2 writers. 
One problematic case was paper. The follow-
ing sentences, for example, remained uncor-
rected:  
  
He published many paper in 
provincial and national pub-
lication. 
He has published thirty-two 
pieces of papers. 
 
Large amounts of additional training data 
would doubtless be helpful in providing contex-
tual resolutions to the problems. Improved 
alignment models may also play a role here in 
capturing complex structures of the kind repre-
sented by constructions involving counters.     
5 Discussion 
The artificially-engineered training data that we 
relied on for our experiments proved surprisingly 
useful in modeling real errors made by non-
native speakers. However, this is obviously a less 
than ideal data source, since the errors introduced 
by regular expressions are homogenously dis-
tributed in a way that naturally-occurring errors 
are not, creating artifacts that undoubtedly impair 
our SMT models.  
Artificial data of this sort may be useful as 
proof of concept, but hand engineering such data 
plainly does not present a viable path to develop-
ing real world applications. In order to be able to 
handle the rich panoply of errors and error inter-
actions encountered in the text of second lan-
guage learners large quantities of naturally-
occurring ?before? and ?after? texts will need to 
be collected. By way of illustration, Table 4 
shows the output of results of ?translating? our 
test data into more natural English by hand and 
dumping the pre- and post-editing pairs to the 
45K training set.6 Although we were unable to 
exactly recover the target sentences, inspection 
showed that 25 sentences had improved, some 
significantly, as Table 4 shows. Under the right 
conditions, the SMT system can capture contex-
tual morphological alternations (nutri-
tion/nutritious), together with complex 
mappings represented by the dependencies 
learn ? knowledge ? many (ESL) and

 Since a single example of each pair was insufficient 
to override the system?s inherent bias towards uni-
gram mappings, 5 copies of each pair were appended 
to the training data.

gain ? knowledge ? a lot of (Eng-
lish). In a rule-based correction system, an im-
mense amount of hand-coding would be required 
to handle even a small subset of the potential 
range of such mismatches between learner and 
native-like English. This knowledge, we believe, 
is best acquired from data.  
5.1 The Need for Data Collection 
Given a sufficiently large corpus of aligned sen-
tences containing error patterns produced by ESL 
writers of the same L1 background and their cor-
rected counterparts we expect eventually to be 
able to capture the rich complexity of non-native 
error within a noisy-channel based SMT model.  
As a practical matter, however, parallel data of 
the kind needed is far from easy to come by. This 
does not mean, however, that such data does not 
exist. The void left by commercial grammar 
checkers is filled, largely unobserved, by a num-
ber of services that provide editorial assistance, 
ranging from foreign language teachers, to lan-
guage helpdesks in multinational corporations, to 
mentoring services for conferences. Translation 
bureaus frequently offer editing services for non-
native speakers. Yet, unlike translation, the ?be-
fore? and ?after? texts are rarely recycled in a 
form that can be used to build translation models. 
Although collecting this data will involve a large 
investment in time, effort, and infrastructure, a 
serious effort along these lines is likely to prove 
fruitful in terms of making it possible to apply 
the SMT paradigm to ESL error correction.  
5.2 Feedback to SMT 
One challenge faced by the SMT model is the 
extremely high quality that will need to be at-
tained before a system might be usable. Since it 
is highly undesirable that learners should be pre-
sented with inaccurate feedback that they may 
not have the experience or knowledge to assess, 
the quality bar imposed on error correction is far 
higher than is that tolerated in machine transla-
tion. Exploration of error correction and writing 
assistance using SMT models may thus prove an 
important venue for testing new SMT models. 
5.3 Advantages of the SMT Approach 
Statistical Machine Translation has provided a 
hugely successful research paradigm within the 
field of natural language processing over the last 
decade. One of the major advantages of using 
SMT in ESL writing assistance is that it can be 
expected to benefit automatically from any pro-
gress made in SMT itself. In fact, the approach 
presented here benefits from all the advantages 
of statistical machine translation. Since the archi-
tecture is not dependent on hard-to-maintain 
rules or regular expressions, little or no linguistic 
expertise will be required in developing and 
maintain applications. As with SMT, this exper-
tise is pushed into the data component, to be 
handled by instructors and editors, who do not 
need programming or scripting skills.  
We expect it to be possible, moreover, once 
parallel data becomes available, to quickly ramp 
up new systems to accommodate the needs of

learners with different first-language back-
grounds and different skill levels and to writing 
assistance for learners of L2s other than English. 
It is also likely that this architecture may have 
applications in pedagogical environments and as 
a tool to assist editors and instructors who deal 
regularly with ESL texts, much in the manner of 
either Human Assisted Machine Translation or 
Machine Assisted Human Translation. We also 
believe that this same architecture could be ex-
tended naturally to provide grammar and style 
tools for native writers.  
6 Conclusion and Future Directions 
In this pilot study we have shown that SMT tech-
niques have potential to provide error correction 
and stylistic writing assistance to L2 learners. 
The next step will be to obtain a large dataset of 
pre- and post-editing ESL text with which to 
train a model that does not rely on engineered 
data. A major purpose of the present study has 
been to determine whether our hypothesis is ro-
bust enough to warrant the cost and effort of a 
collection or data creation effort.  
Although we anticipate that it will take a sig-
nificant lead time to assemble the necessary 
aligned data, once a sufficiently large corpus is 
in hand, we expect to begin exploring ways to 
improve our SMT system by tailoring it more 
specifically to the demands of editorial assistance. 
In particular, we expect to be looking into alter-
native word alignment models and possibly en-
hancing our system?s decoder using some of the 
richer, more structured language models that are 
beginning to emerge.
