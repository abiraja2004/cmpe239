Abstract 
This paper describes experiment's in the automat'ic 
construction of lexicons that would be useflfl in 
searching large document collect'ions tot text frag~ 
ments tinct address a specific inibrmation eed, such 
as an answer to a quest'ion. 
1 Introduct ion 
In develot)ing a syst'em to find answers in text to 
user questions, we mmovered a major obstacle: Doe- 
mnent sentences t'hat contained answers dkl not of_ 
ten use the same expressions as the question. While 
an:;wers in documents and questiolts llse terms that' 
are relat'e(l to each other, a system that sear(:hes for 
answers based on the quesl:ion wording will often 
fail. 3.b address t'his probleln, we develol)ed tech- 
niques to al,tomatically build a lexicon of associated 
terms t'hat can be used to hell) lind al)lIrol/riate bext' 
seglllent,s. 
The mismatch })et'ween (tuestion an(l doctlttlent 
wording was I)rought home to us in an analysis of a 
testbed of question/answer l/airs. \~Ze had a collec- 
tion of newswire articles about the Clinton impeach- 
ment t'() use as a small-scale corl)uS fin' development 
of ;_t system. V~Ze asked several )eol)le to 1)ose ques- 
tions about this well-known t'opic, but we (lid not 
make the corpus availal)le to our cont'ril)utors. \~Ze 
wanted to avoid quest'ions that tracked t'he terminol- 
ogy in t'he corlms too (:losely to s innl late quest'ions 
t'o a real-world syst'em. The result was a set of ques- 
tions that  used language that' rarely nmtched t'he 
phrasing in the. corl)us. \,Ve had expected t'hat' we 
would be able to make most of these lexical connec- 
tions with the hel l) of V~rordnet (Miller, 1990). 
For example, consider a simple quest'ion al)out tes- 
timony: "Did Secret Service agents give testimony 
about' Bill Clinton?" There is no reason t'o expect 
that' the answer would appear 1)aldly st'ated as "Se- 
cret Service. agents dkl testi(y ..." What  we need 
to know is what' testimony is about', where it: occurs, 
who gives it. The answer would lie likely to be found 
in a passage ment'ioning juries, or 1)roseeut'ors, like 
these tbund in our Clinton corl)uS: 
Starr immediately brought Secret Service 
employees before tim grand jury for ques- 
tioning. 
Prosecutors repeat'edly asked Secret Ser- 
viee 1)ersonnel to rel)eat' gossil) they may 
have heard. 
Yet, tile V~ordnet synsets fbr "testinlony" offer: 
"evidence, assertion, averment alia asseveration," 
not a very hell)tiff selection here. -Wordnet hyper- 
nyms become general quickly: "declarat'ion," indi- 
cat'ion" and " infor lnat ion" are only one st, eli u 1) in 
t'lle hierarehy. Following these does not lead us into 
a courtroom. 
We asked our cont'ril)ut'ors for a second round of 
questions, but this time made the corpus available 
to them, exl)laining t'hat we wanted to be sure the 
answers were contained in t'he collection of articles. 
'J'he result was a set of questions that' mueh more 
closely matched t'he wording in the corpus. This was~ 
in t'aet, what' the 1999 DARPA question-answering 
(:oml)et'ition did in order t'o ensure that their ques- 
tions couhl be answered (Singhal, 1!199). The sec- 
trod quest ion-answer ing  conference adopted a new 
approach to gathering questions and verifying sepa- 
rately that' they a.re answerable. 
Our intuition is t'hat if we can lind the tyl)ical 
lexical neighborhoods of concept's, we can efficiently 
locate a concept described in a query or a question 
without needing to know the precise way the answer 
is phrased and without relying on a cost'ly, hand- 
built concept' hierarchy. 
The example above illustrat'es the 1)oint. Tes- 
t imony is given 1) 3, wit'nesses, defendant's, eyewit- 
nesses. It is solicited by 1)rosecutors, counsels, 
lawyers. It is heard by judges, juries at trials, hear- 
ings, and recorded in depositions and transcripts. 
What' we wanted was a complete description of t'he 
world of testimony - the who, what, when and 
where of the word. Or, in other words, the "meta- 
aboutness" of terms. 
To this end, we exl)erimented /tSitlg shallow lin- 
guist.k: techniques t'o gat'her and analyze word co- 
occurrence data in various configurat'ions. Unlike 
previous collocation research, we were int'erested 
in an expansive set' of relationships between words 
719 
rather than a specific relationship. More important, 
we felt that the information we needed could be de- 
rived from an analysis that crossed clause and sen- 
tence boundaries. We hyl)othesized that news ar- 
ticles would be coherent so that the sequences of 
sentences and clauses would be linked conceptually. 
We exanfined the nouns in a number of configura- 
tions - paragraphs, entences, clauses and sequences 
of clauses - and obtained tile strongest results from 
configurations that count co-occurrences across the 
surface subjects of sequences of two to six clauses. 
Exl)eriments with multi-clause configurations were 
generally more accurate in a variety of experiments. 
In the next section, we briefly review related re- 
search. In section 3 we describe our experiments. 
In section 4, we discuss the problem of evaluation, 
and look ahead to future directions in the concluding 
sections. 
2 Re la ted  Work 
There has been a large body of work ill the collec- 
tion of co-occurrence data from a broad spectrum of 
perspectives, fi'om information retrieval to the devel- 
opnlent of statistical methods for investigating word 
similarity and classification. Our efforts fall some- 
where in tile middle. 
Compared with document retrieval tasks, we are 
more closely focused on the words themselves and 
on specific concepts than on document "aboutness." 
Jing and Croft (1994) exanfined words and phrases 
in paragraph units, and found that the association 
data improves retrieval performance. Callan (1994) 
compared paragraph units and fixed windows of text 
in examining passage-level retrieval. 
In the question-answering context, Morton (1999) 
collected document co-occurrence statistics to un- 
cover 1)art-whole and synonymy relationships to use 
in a question-answering system. The key differ- 
ence here was that co-occurrence was considered on 
a whole-docmnent basis. Harabagiu and Maiorano 
(1999) argued that indexing in question answering 
should be based on 1)aragraphs. 
One recent al)proach to automatic lexicon build- 
ing has used seed words to lmild up larger sets of 
semmltically similar words in one or nlore categories 
(Riloff and Shepherd, 1997). In addition, Strza- 
lkowski and Wang (1996) used a bootstrapping tech- 
nique to identify types of references, and Riloff and 
Jones (1999) adapted bootstrapping techniques to 
lexicon building targeted to information extraction. 
In the same vein, researchers at Brown Univer- 
sity (Caraballo and Charniak, 1999)~ (Berland and 
Charniak, 1999), (Caraballo, 1999) and (Roark and 
Charniak, 1998) focused on target constructions, in
particular complex noun t)hrases, and searched for 
information ot only on identifying classes of nouns, 
lint also hypernyms, noun specificity and meronymy. 
We have a diflbrent perspective than these lines of 
inquiry. They were specifying various semantic rela- 
tionships and seeking ways to collect similar pairs. 
We. have a less restrictive focus and are relying on 
surface syntactic information about clauses. 
For more than a decade, a variety of statistical 
techniques have been developed and refilled. Tile 
focus of much of this work was to develop the 
methods themselves. Church and Hanks (1989) ex- 
plored tile use of mutual information statistics in 
ranking co-occurrences within five-word windows. 
Smadja (1992) gathered co-occurrences within five- 
word windows to find collocations, particularly in 
specific domains. Hindle (1990) classified nouns 
on the basis of co-occurring patterns of subject- 
verb and verb-object pairs. Hatzivassiloglou and 
MeKeown (1993) clustered adjectives into semantic 
classes, and Pereira et al (1993) clustered nouns on 
their appearance ill verb-object pairs. We are try- 
ing to be less restrictive in learning multiple salient 
relationshil)s between words rather than seeldng a 
particular elationship. 
Ill a way, our idea is the mirror image of Barzilay 
and Elhadad (1997), who used Wordnet to identify 
lexical chains that would coincide with cohesive text 
segments. We assunmd that documents are cohesive 
and that co-occurrence l)atterns call uncover word 
relationships. 
3 Experiments 
Tile focus of onr experiment was on units of text in 
which the constituents must fit together in order for 
the discourse to be coherent. We made the assump- 
tion that the documents in our corpus were coherent 
and reasoned that if we had enough text, covering 
a broad range of topics, we could pick out domain- 
independent associations. For example, testimony 
can be about virtually anything, since anything can 
wind up in a court dispute. But over a large enough 
collection of text, the terms that directly relate to 
tile "who," "what" and "where" of testimony per 
se should appear in segments with testimony more 
frequently than chance. 
These associations do not necessarily appear in a 
dictionary or thesaurus. When huntans explain all 
unfamiliar word, they often use scenarios and analo- 
gies. 
We divided the experiments in two groups: one 
group that looks at co-occurrences within a single 
unit, and another that looks at a sequence of units. 
In the first group of experinmnts, we considered 
paragraphs, sentences and clauses, each with and 
without prepositional phrases. 
? Single paragraphs with/without PP 
? Single sentences with/without PP 
? Single clauses with/without PP 
720 
\]in the second group, we considered two clauses 
and sequences of subject 110un phrases from two to 
six chmses. Ill this group, we had: 
,, Two clauses with/without Pl) 
,, A sequence of subject NPs fl'onl 2 clauses 
A sequence of subject NPs Dora 3 clauses 
,, A sequence of subject NPs from 4 clauses 
? A sequence of subject NPs fi'om 5 clauses 
,, A sequence of subject NPs from 6 clauses 
The intuition for the second groul) is that a topic 
flows from one granmm.tical unit to another so that 
the salient nouns, l)articularly the surface subjects, 
in successive clauses should reveal the associations 
we are seeldng. 
'\[lo illustrate the method, consider the three-clause 
configuration: Say that ~vordi apl)ears in clausc,~. 
We maintain a table of all word pairs and increment 
the entries for O,,o,'(h , ',,,o,'d~ ), where , ,0 ,% is a sub- 
ject noun in cla'usc,~, clauscn+~, or ell'use,+2. No 
effort was made to resolve pronomial references, and 
these were skipped. 
We used nollnS Olfly' because l)reliminary tests 
showed that pairings between ouns seemed to stand 
out. V~Te included tokens that were tagged as 1)roper 
nall leS when they also have have con ln lon  n lean ings .  
For example, consider the Linguistic Data Consor- 
l;ium at the University of Pennsylvania. Data, Con- 
sortium and University wouM be on tile list used to 
build the table of nmtchul)s with other nouns, \])lit 
l)emlsylvania would not. V~To also collected noun 
modifiers as well as head nouns as they can carry 
more information than the surface heads, such as 
"business group", '".science class" or "crinm scene." 
The corpus consisted of all tile general-interest ar- 
ticles from the New York Tinms newswire in 1996 
in the North American News Corlms , and (lid not 
include either st)orts or l)usiness news. We tirst re- 
moved dul)licate articles. The data fl'om 1996 was 
too slmrse for the sequence-of-subjects ontigura- 
lions. '\]'o l)alance the expcrinmnts better, we added 
another year's worth of newswire articles, from 1995, 
tbr the sequence-of subject configurations sothat we 
had more than one million matchups for each con- 
figuration (Table 1). 
The I)roeess is flflly automatic, requiring no su- 
1)ervision or training examples. The corpus was 
tagged with a decision-tree tagger (Schmid, 1994) 
and parsed with a finite-state parser (Abney, 1996) 
using a specially written context-fi'ee-grannnar that 
focused on locating clause boundaries. The gram- 
mar also identified extended noun l)hrases in tile sub- 
ject position, verb l)hrases and other noun l)hrases 
and prepositional 1)hrases. The nouns in the tagged, 
parsed corl)uS were reduced to their syntactic roots 
(removing l)lurals from nouns) with a lookup table 
created t'rom Wordnet (Miller, 1990) and CELEX 
(1995). We. performed this last step mainly to ad- 
dress the sparse data problem. There were a sub- 
stantial nunfl)er of paMngs that occurred only once. 
We elinfinated from considerat;ion all such single- 
tons, although it did not al)peal to have much etfect 
on the overall outcome.

Td)le 2: Distinct Nouns, 1996 Data 
To score the nmtchups in our initial exlmriments , 
we used the Dice Coeliicient, which l)roduces values 
i'ronl 0 to 1, to measure the association between pairs 
of words and then produced an ordered association 
list fl'om the co-occurrence table, ranked according 
to the scores of the entries. 
2 ? f, '~q(wo,.,h n ,oo ,%)  
score,, = frcq(wordi) + frcq(wordj) 
One 1)roblem was immediately al)parent: The 
quality of tile association lists wxried greatly. Tile 
scoring was doing an acceptable job in ranking the 
words within each list, but tile scores varied greatly 
from one list to another. Our initial strategy was 
to choose a cutoff, which we set at 21 tbr each list, 
and we tried several alternatives to weed out weak 
associations. 
721 
In one method, we filtered the association lists 
by cross-referencing, removing from the association 
list for wordi any wordj that failed to reciprocate 
and to give a high rank to wordi on its association 
list. Another similar approach was to try to con> 
bine evidence fl'om different experiments by taking 
the results fl'om two configurations into considera- 
tion. A third strategy was to calculate the mutual 
information between the target word and the other 
words on its association list. 
scorc,,i = p(xy) * log \p(z)p(y) ( (xy) ) 
Using the mutual information computation pro- 
vided an way of using a single measure that was able 
to compare matchups across lists. We set a threshold 
of lxl.0 -6 for all matchups. Thus these association 
lists vary in length, depending on the distributions 
for the words, allowing them to grow up to 40, while 
some ended up with only one or two words. 
4 Evaluation 
The evaluation of a system like ours is problematic. 
The judgments we made to determine correctness 
were not only highly subjective but time-consunfing. 
We had 12 large lexicons fl'om the different config- 
urations. We had chosen a random sample of 10 
percent of the 2,700 words that occurred at least 
100 times in tile corpus, and manually constructed 
an answer key, which ended up with ahnost 30,000 
entries. 
From the resulting 270 words, we discarded 15 of 
those that coincided with common names of peo- 
ple, such as "carter," which could refer to the for- 
mer American president, Chris Carter (creator of 
tile television show "X-Files"), among others. We 
thought it better to delay making decisions on how 
to handle such cases, especially since it would require 
distinguishing one Carter fl'om another. Such words 
presented several difficulties. Unless the individuals 
involved were well-known, it was often impossible to 
distinguish whether the system was making errors 
or whether the resulting descriptive terms were in- 
tbrmative. 
Tables 3 and 4 show an example from the answer 
key tbr the word "faculty." 
The overall results from the first stage of the pro- 
cess, before the cross-referencing filter are shown in 
Table 5, ranging from 73% to 80% correct. The con- 
figurations that included prepositional phrases and 
those that used sequences of subject noun phrases 
outperformed the configurations that relied on suh- 
jects and objects in a single grammatical unit. These 
differences were statistically significant, with p < 
0.01 in all eases. 
The overall results after cross-referencing, in Ta- 
ble 6, showed improvements of 5 to 10 percentage

Table 4: Answer Key ff)r Faculty: Wrong 
points, while the effect of the number of matchups 
was diminished. Here, the subject-sequence onfig- 
urations showed a distinct advantage. While more 
noise might be expected when a large segment of text; 
is considered, these results support the notion that 
the nnderlying coherence of a discourse can be recov- 
ered with the prol)er selection of linguistic features. 
The improvements in each configuration over the 
corresponding configuration in the first stage were 
all statistically significant, with p < 0.01. Likewise, 
the edge the sequence-of subjects configurations had 
over tile other configurations, was also statistically 
significant. 
The results fl'om combining the evidence from dif- 
ferent configurations, in Table 7, showed a much 
higher accnrae> but a sharp drop in the total nnm- 
ber of associated words found. The most fl'uitful 
pairs of experiments were those that combined dis- 
tinct approaches, for example, tile five-subject con- 
figuration with either fifll paragraphs or with sen- 
tences with prepositional phrases. It will remain 
unclear until we conduct a task-based evaluation 
whether the smaller number of associations will be 
harnfful. 
The final experiment, computing the mutual in- 
formation statistic tbr the matchul)s of a key word 
with co-occurring words was perhaps the most ill- 
teresting because it gave us the ability to apply a

and a fair amount of overlap between the two.

Finally, the even-sparser mutual information list 
for the paragraph configuration lists only "navy" 
and "suicide." 
5 Conc lus ion  
Our results are encouraging. We were able to deci- 
pher a broad type of word association, and showed 
that our method of searching sequences of subjects 
outperformed the snore traditional approaches in 
finding collocations. We believe we can use tiffs tech- 
nique to build a large-scale l xicon to help in diffi- 
cult information retrieval and information extraction 
tasks like question answering. 
The most interesting aspect of" this work lies in 
the system's ability to look across several clauses 
and strengthen tile connections between associated 
words. We are able to deal with input that con- 
tains numerous errors from the tagging and shallow 
parsing processes. Local context has been studied 
extensively in recent years with sophisticated statis- 
tical tools and the availability of enormous amounts 
of text in digital form. Perhaps we can expand this 
perspective to look at a window of perhaps everal 
sentences by extracting the correct linguistic units in 
order to explore a large range of language processing 
problems.

6 Future  Work  
? We will have the scoring key itself evaluated by 
people who are not involved in tile research. 
? ~re are planning to conduct ask-based evalua- 
tion in question answering. 
? We are considering deploying a named entity 
module to provide sonic classification of which 
proper nouns should be counted and which 
should not. 
? We 1)lan to experiment with ways to incorpo- 
rate using examining verbs and making use of 
surface objects in the configurations with se- 
quences of clauses, as well as strengthen the fi- 
nite state grammar. 
? We will explore using tile system to extract bi- 
ographic information.
