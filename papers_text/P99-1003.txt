Abstract 
Computational linguistics is generally considered to be the branch 
of engineering that uses computers to do useful things with linguistic 
signals, but it can also be viewed as an extended test of computational 
theories of human cognition; it is this latter perspective that psychol- 
ogists find most interesting. Language provides a critical test for the 
hypothesis that physical symbol systems are adequate to perform all 
human cognitive functions. As yet, no adequate system for natural 
language processing has approached human levels of performance. 
Of the various problems that natural anguage processing has re- 
vealed, polysemy is probably the most frustrating. People deal with 
polysemy so easily that potential abiguities are overlooked, whereas 
computers must work hard to do far less well. A linguistic approach 
generally involves a parser, a lexicon, and some ad hoc rules for using 
linguistic ontext o identify the context-appropriate sense. A statisti- 
cal approach generally involves the use of word co-occurrence statistics 
to create a semantic hyperspace where each word, regardless ofits pol- 
ysemy, is represented asa single vector. Each approach as strengths 
and limitations; some combination is often proposed. Various possibil- 
ities will be discussed in terms of their psychological p ausibility.
