Abstract 
As interest grows in the use of linguistically 
annotated corpora in research and teaching of 
foreign languages and literature, treebanks of 
various historical texts have been developed.  
We introduce the first large-scale dependency 
treebank for Classical Chinese literature.  De-
rived from the Stanford dependency types, it 
consists of over 32K characters drawn from a 
collection of poems written in the 8th century 
CE.  We report on the design of new depend-
ency relations, discuss aspects of the annota-
tion process and evaluation, and illustrate its 
use in a study of parallelism in Classical Chi-
nese poetry. 
1 Introduction 
Recent efforts in creating linguistically annotated 
text corpora have overwhelmingly focused on 
modern languages.  Among the earliest and most 
well-known are the part-of-speech (POS) tagged 
Brown Corpus (Francis & Ku?era, 1982), and the 
syntactically analyzed Penn Treebank (Marcus et 
al., 1993). However, the first digital corpus, which 
emerged soon after the invention of computers, had 
as its subject matter a collection of 13th-century 
texts --- in 1949, Roberto Busa initiated the POS 
tagging of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas, 
written in Latin. 
In the past decade, Humanities scholars have 
begun to use digital corpora for the study of an-
cient languages and historical texts. They come in 
a variety of languages and genres, from Old Eng-
lish (Taylor et al, 2003) to Early New High Ger-
man (Demske et al, 2004) and Medieval Portu-
guese (Rocio et al 2000); and from poetry 
(Pintzuk & Leendert, 2001) to religious texts such 
as the New Testament (Haug & J?hndal, 2008) and 
the Quran (Dukes & Buckwalter, 2010).  They are 
increasingly being leveraged in teaching (Crane et 
al., 2009) and in research (Lancaster, 2010). 
This paper describes the first large-scale de-
pendency treebank for Classical Chinese.  The 
treebank consists of poems from the Tang Dynasty 
(618 ? 907 CE), considered one of the crowning 
achievements in traditional Chinese literature.  The 
first half of the paper reviews related work (section 
2), then describes the design of the treebank (sec-
tion 3), its text and evaluation (section 4).  The 
second half shows the research potentials of this 
treebank with a study on parallelism in (section 5).  
2 Previous Work  
Existing linguistic resources for Chinese is pre-
dominantly for the modern language.  This section 
first describes the major Modern Chinese treebanks 
on which we based our work (section 2.1), then 
summarizes previous research in word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging, two pre-requisites for build-
ing a Classical Chinese treebank (section 2.2). 
2.1 Modern Chinese 
Most treebanks have been annotated under one of 
two grammatical theories, the phrase structure 
grammar, which is adopted by the Penn Treebank 
(Marcus et al, 1993), or dependency grammar, 
adopted by the Prague Dependency Treebank 
191
(Hajic, 1998).  The most widely used treebank for 
Modern Chinese, the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue 
et al, 2005), belongs to the former kind. 
Rather than encoding constituency information, 
dependency grammars give information about 
grammatical relations between words.  Modern 
Chinese has been analyzed in this framework, for 
example at Stanford University (Chang et al, 
2009).  The dependency relations follow the design 
principles of those initially applied to English (de 
Marneffe and Manning, 2008), with a few added 
relations to accommodate Chinese-specific fea-
tures, such as the ?ba?-construction.  Their POS 
tagset is borrowed from that of the Penn Chinese 
Treebank. 
2.2 Classical Chinese 
Like its modern counterpart, two pre-requisites for 
constructing a Classical Chinese treebank are word 
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. In this 
section, we first summarize existing POS tagging 
frameworks, then describe the only current tree-
bank of Classical Chinese.  
Word boundaries and parts-of-speech tags have 
been added to the Academia Sinica Ancient Chi-
nese Corpus (Wei et al, 1997) and the Sheffield 
Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al, 2005). Since there is 
not yet a scholarly consensus on word segmenta-
tion in Chinese (Feng 1998), it is not surprising 
that there are wide-ranging levels of granularity of 
the POS tagsets.  They range from 21 tags in 
(Huang et al, 2002), 26 in the Peking University 
corpus (Yu et al, 2002), 46 in the Academia Sini-
ca Balanced Corpus (Chen et al, 1996), to 111 in 
the Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al, 2005).   
This treebank uses a system of nested POS tags 
(Lee, 2012), which accommodates different poli-
cies for word segmentation and maximize interop-
erability between corpora. 
The only previous syntactic treebank for Classi-
cal Chinese is a constituent-based one (Huang et 
al., 2002), composed of 1000 sentences from pre-
Tsin Classical Chinese. No word segmentation was 
performed for this treebank. 
3 Treebank design  
Although Classical Chinese is not mutually intelli-
gible with Modern Chinese, the two share consid-
erable similarities in vocabulary and grammar.  
Given the seminal work already achieved for Mod-
ern Chinese, our principle is to borrow from exist-
ing annotation framework as much as possible. For 
example, our POS tagset is based on that of the 
Penn Chinese Treebank, after a slight revision of 
its 33 tags (Lee, 2012). This approach not only 
gives users a familiar point of reference, and also 
makes the treebank interoperable with existing 
Modern Chinese resources.  Interoperability allows 
the potential of bootstrapping with Modern Chi-
nese data, as well as contrastive studies for the two 
languages.

lines (forming a parallel couplet)1.  The POS tags are 
based on (Xue et al, 2005); the dependency relations on 
(Chang et al, 2009).  The two lines are perfectly paral-
lel both in terms of POS and dependencies. 
 
A dependency framework is chosen for two rea-
sons.  First, words in Classical Chinese poems, our 
target text (section 4), tend to have relatively free 
word order.  Dependency grammars can handle 
this phenomenon well.  Second, our treebank is 
expected to be used pedagogically, and we expect 
explicit grammatical relations between words to be 
helpful to students.  These relations also encode

semantic information, which lend themselves to 
meaning extraction applications. 
Our set of dependency relations is based on 
those developed at Stanford University for Modern 
Chinese (see section 2.2).  Our approach is to map 
their 44 dependency relations, as much as possible, 
to Classical Chinese.  Modern Chinese, a non-
inflectional language, does not mark many linguis-
tic features, including person, gender, and number, 
etc.  It uses a small number of function words to 
encode other features, such as tense, voice, and 
case. Many of these function words do not exist in 
Classical Chinese.  In particular, prepositions are 
rare 2 ; instead, nouns expressing time, locations, 
instruments, indirect recipients, etc., modify the 
verb directly. This phenomenon prompted the in-
troduction of two new relations ?locative modifi-
ers? (section 3.1) and ?oblique objects? (section 
3.2); and the re-instatement of two relations, ?noun 
phrases as adverbial modifiers? (section 3.3) and 
?indirect objects?, from the Stanford dependencies 
(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) that are exclud-
ed from the Modern Chinese variant (Chang et al, 
2009) .  An overview is provided in Table 1. 
 
Table 1.  Comparison of our set of dependency relations 
with the Stanford dependencies for English (de Marnef-
fe and Manning, 2008) and for Modern Chinese (Chang 
et al, 2009). All other relations from Stanford Modern 
Chinese are retained and are not listed here.   
3.1 Locative modifiers 
To indicate time, English usually requires a prepo-
sition (e.g., ?on Monday?), but sometimes does not 
                                                          
2 Classical Chinese has a category of verbs called ?coverbs? 
which function like prepositions, but are less frequently used. 
(Pulleyblank, 1995). 
(e.g., ?today?).  For the latter case, the bare noun 
phrase is considered a ?temporal modifier? in a 
tmod relation with the verb in (de Marneffe and 
Manning, 2008). 
Similarly, to indicate locations, a preposition is 
normally required in English (e.g., ?on the hill?).  
However, in Classical Chinese, the preposition is 
frequently omitted, with the bare locative noun 
phrase modifying the verb directly.  To mark these 
nouns, we created the ?locative modifier? relation 
(lmod). Consider sentence (1) in Table 2.  Alt-
hough the word ?hill? occupies the position nor-
mally reserved for the subject, it actually indicates 
a location, and is therefore assigned the lmod rela-
tion.  In sentence (2), the locative noun ?alley? is 
placed after the verb. 
3.2 Oblique objects 
Oblique objects are a well-known category in the 
analysis of ancient Indo-European languages, for 
example Latin and ancient Greek.  In the PROIEL 
treebank (Haug and J?hndal, 2008), for example, 
the ?oblique? (obl) relation marks arguments of 
the verb which are not subjects or non-accusative 
?objects?.  These are most commonly nouns in the 
dative or ablative case, as well as prepositional 
phrases.  It is believed that oblique objects exist in 
Classical Chinese, but have been replaced by prep-
ositional phrases in Modern Chinese (Li and Li, 
1986). 
The obl relation is imported to our treebank to 
mark nouns that directly modify a verb to express 
means, instrument, and respect, similar to the func-
tions of datives and ablatives. They typically come 
after the verb.  In sentence (6) in Table 2, the noun 
?cup? is used in an instrumental sense to modify 
?drunk? in an obl relation. 
3.3 Noun phrase as adverbial modifier  
A temporal modifier such as ?today? is an example 
where a noun phrase serves as an adverbial modifi-
er in English.  This usage is more general and ex-
tends to other categories such as floating reflexives 
(e.g., it is itself adequate), and other PP-like NPs 
(e.g., two times a day).  These noun phrases are 
marked with the relation npadvmod in (de Marn-
effe and Manning, 2008).

In Modern Chinese, this usage is less frequent4, 
perhaps leading to its exclusion in (Chang et al, 
2009).  In contrast, in Classical Chinese, nouns 
function much more frequently in this capacity, 
expressing metaphoric meaning, reasons, moods,

repetitions, etc., and typically preceding the verb 
(Li and Li, 1986).  Sentences (4) and (5) in Table 2 
provide examples of this kind, with the noun ?self? 
as a reflexive, and the noun ?year? indicating repe-
tition. 
3.4 Indirect objects  
The double object construction contains two ob-
jects in a verb phrase.  The direct object is the 
thing or person that is being transferred or moved 
(e.g., ?he gave me a book?); the indirect object is 
the recipient (?he gave me a book?).  In inflected 
languages, the noun representing the indirect ob-
ject may be marked by case. Since Classical Chi-
nese does not have this linguistic device, the 
indirect object is unmarked; we distinguish it with 
the ?indirect object? label (iobj). 
The iobj label exists in Stanford English de-
pendencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but 
was not included in the Modern Chinese version 
(Chang et al, 2009), likely due to its infrequent 
appearance in Modern Chinese. It is re-instated in 
our Classical Chinese treebank.  Sentence (3) in 
Table 2 provides an example, with ?word? as the 
direct object and ?person? as the indirect. 
3.5 Absence of copular verbs  
In a copular construction such as ?A is B?, A is 
considered the ?topic? (top) of the copular verb 
?is? (Chang et al, 2009).  The copular, however, is 
rarely used in Classical Chinese (Pulleyblank, 
1995). In some cases, it is replaced by an adverb 
that functions as a copular verb. If so, that adverb 
is POS-tagged as such (VC) in our treebank, and 
the dependency tree structure is otherwise normal.  
In other cases, the copular is absent altogether.  
Rather than inserting implicit nodes as in (Haug 
and J?hndal, 2008), we expand the usage of the 
top relation.  It usually connects the subject (?A?) 
to the copular, but would in this case connect it 
with the noun predicate (?B?) instead.  In the ex-
ample sentence below, the relation top(?capable?, 
?general?) would be assigned.

3.6 Discourse relations  
Two clauses may be connected by a discourse rela-
tion, such as causal or temporal.  In English, these 
relations may be explicitly realized, most common-
ly by discourse connectives, such as ?because? or 
?when?.  Even in the absence of these connectives, 
however, two adjacent clauses can still hold an 
implicit discourse relation. A detailed study, which 
resulted in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et 
al., 2008), found that explicit relations outnumber 
implicit ones in English, but the latter is nonethe-
less quite common and can be annotated with high 
inter-annotator agreement.  
 
 
Table 3.  Example sentences illustrating the use of dis-
course labels for discourse relations6. 
 
In many ancient languages, explicit realization 
of discourse relations is less frequent.  In Latin and 
Ancient Greek, for instance, these connectives are 
often replaced by a participial clause.  The partici-
ple is marked only by the genitive or ablative case, 
leaving the reader to decide from context how it 
relates to the main clause.  As a non-inflectional 
language, Classical Chinese cannot use this device, 
and instead typically constructs a complex sen-
tence with a series of verbs without any marking 
(Pulleyblank, 1995). For example, sentence (2) in

6 From top to bottom, Meng Haoran ???????,???
????, and Du Fu  ??????? 
Table 3 literally says ?not capable, good ruler for-
sake?; the onus is put on the reader to interpret the 
first two characters to form a clause that provides 
the reason for the rest of the line. 
This condensed style of expression often erects a 
barrier for understanding.  Although the focus of 
the treebank is on syntax rather than discourse, we 
decided to annotate these relations. Implicit con-
nectives are more difficult to achieve inter-
annotator agreement (Prasad et al, 2008); since 
they are mostly implicit in Classical Chinese, we 
adopted a coarse-grained classification system, 
rather than the hierarchical system of sense tags in 
the Penn Discourse Treebank.  More precisely, it 
contains only the four categories posited by 
(Wang, 2003) --- causal, concessive, temporal, and 
conditional.  Table 3 gives some examples. 
When it is impossible to determine the discourse 
relation between two lines, the default ?dependent? 
(dep) label is assigned.  This label is originally 
used when ?the system is unable to determine a 
more precise dependency relation between two 
words? (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). 
4 Data  
Among the various literary genres, poetry enjoys 
perhaps the most elevated status in the Classical 
Chinese tradition. The Tang Dynasty is considered 
the golden age of shi, one of the five subgenres of 
Chinese poetry7.  The Complete Shi Poetry of the 
Tang (Peng, 1960), originally compiled in 1705, 
consists of nearly 50,000 poems by more than two 
thousand poets. This book is treasured by scholars 
and the public alike.  Even today, Chinese people 
informally compose couplets (see section 5), in the 
style of shi poetry, to celebrate special occasions 
such as birthdays.  Indeed, NLP techniques have 
been applied to generate them automatically (Jiang 
and Zhou, 2008). 
4.1 Material  
This treebank contains the complete works, a total 
of over 32,000 characters in 521 poems, by two 
Chinese poets in the 8th century CE, Wang Wei and 
Meng Haoran.  Wang, also known as the Poet-
Buddha (shifo ??), is considered one of the three 
most prominent Tang poets.   Meng is often asso-

ciated with Wang due to the similarity of his po-
ems in style and content. 
Aside from the dependency relations, word 
boundaries and POS tags, the treebank contains a 
number of metadata.  For each character, the tone 
is noted as either level (ping?) or oblique (ze ?).  
Each poem is also recorded for its title, author, and 
genre, which may be ?recent-style? (jintishi ???
) or ?ancient-style? (gutishi ???).    
This choice of our text stems from three motiva-
tions.  Classical Chinese is typically written in a 
compressed style, especially so with poetry, where 
the word order is relatively flexible, and grammati-
cal exceptions are frequent.  These characteristics 
pose a formidable challenge for students of Classi-
cal Chinese, for whom Tang poetry often forms 
part of the introductory material.  It is hoped that 
this treebank will serve a pedagogical purpose.  
Second, this challenging text makes it more likely 
that the resulting dependency framework can suc-
cessfully handle other Classical Chinese texts.  
Third, Tang poetry is an active area of research in 
Chinese philology, and we aspire to contribute to 
their endeavor. 
4.2 Inter-annotator agreement  
Two annotators, both university graduates with a 
degree in Chinese, created this treebank.  To meas-
ure inter-annotator agreement, we set apart a subset 
of about 1050 characters, on which both of them 
independently perform three tasks: POS tagging, 
head selection, and dependency labeling. 
Their agreement rate is 95.1%, 92.3%, and 
91.2% for the three respective tasks. For POS tag-
ging, the three main error categories are the confu-
sion between adverbs (AD) and verbs with an 
adverbial force, between measure words (M) and 
nouns (NN), and between adjectives (JJ) and 
nouns.  The interested reader is referred to (Lee, 
2012) for a detailed analysis.   
These differences in POS tags trickle down to 
head selection and dependency labeling. In fact, all 
words which received different POS tags also re-
ceived different dependency relations.  To illus-
trate with a disagreement between adverb and verb, 
consider the following sentence. The word ? 
kong ?afraid? may be considered as an adverb, ex-
pressing the psychological state for the verb ?at-
tract?; or, alternatively, as a verb in its own right.  
Depending on the decision, it bears either the rela-
tion advmod or root. 
 
? ? ? ? ? 
?afraid? ?attract? ?burden? ?fame? ?affect? 
[I am] afraid [I] will attract and be burdened by fame8. 
 
Some differences are genuine alternative annota-
tions, resulting from a mixture of polysemy and 
flexible word order.  Consider the sentence ???
? dan shi yi he, consisting of four characters 
meaning, in order, ?bowl / blanket?, ?food?, a copu-
lar or a particle, and ?what?.  If the meaning ?bowl? 
and copular is taken, it means ?What food is con-
tained in that bowl?? In this case, the relation clf 
is required for ? dan, and ? yi is the root word. 
Alternatively, if the meaning ?blanket? and particle 
is taken, it is interpreted as ?What food is placed on 
the blanket??  Here, dan takes on the relation nn, 
and the root word would be ? he instead. 
 
5 Application: Parallel Couplets  
We now demonstrate one use of this treebank by 
analyzing a well-known but understudied feature 
of Classical Chinese poetry: the parallel couplets. 
5.1 Introduction 
Parallelism in poetry refers to the correspondence 
of one line with another; the two lines may bear 
similar or opposite meaning, and have comparable 
grammatical constructions.  This phenomenon is 
perhaps most well known in classical Hebrew po-
etry, but it is also one of the defining features of 
Chinese poetry; ?it pervades their poetry universal-
ly, forms its chief characteristic feature, and is the 
source of a great deal of its artificial beauty?, ob-
served Sir John Francis Davis, author of one of the 
earliest commentaries on Chinese poetry published 
in the West (Davis 1969).   
The lines in a Chinese poem almost always con-
tain the same number of characters, most common-
ly either five or seven characters.  This exact 
equality of the number of characters makes it espe-
cially suited for expressing parallelism, which be-
came a common feature ever since ?recent-style? 
poetry (section 4.1) was developed during the Tang

Dynasty.  Unlike those in ?ancient-style?, poems of 
this style are tonally regulated and assume a high 
degree of parallelism within a couplet, i.e., two 
adjacent lines.  See Figure 1 for an example. 
5.2 Methodology 
The couplet in Figure 1 is undisputedly symmetric, 
both in terms of POS tags and dependency labels.  
The definition for parallelism is, however, quite 
loose; in general, the corresponding characters 
must ?agree? in part-of-speech and have related 
meaning.  These are unavoidably subjective no-
tions. 
While a vast amount of Tang poems have been 
digitized, they have not been POS-tagged or syn-
tactically analyzed in any significant amount.  It is 
not surprising, therefore, that no large-scale, em-
pirical study on how, and how often, the characters 
?agree?.  There have been a study on 1,000 cou-
plets (Cao, 1998), and another on a small subset of 
the poems of Du Mu (Huang, 2006), but neither 
clarify the criteria for parallelism. We undertake a 
descriptive, rather than prescriptive, approach, us-
ing only the treebank data as the basis. 
Character-level parallelism.   Even given the 
POS tags, this study is not straightforward. The 
naive metric of requiring exactly matched POS 
tags yields a parallel rate of only 74% in the corpus 
as a whole.  This figure can be misleading, because 
it would vary according to the granularity of the 
POS tagset: the more fine-grained it is, the less 
agreement there would be.  As a metric for paral-
lelism, it has high precision but lower recall, and 
would only be appropriate for certain applications 
such as couplet generation (Jiang and Zhou, 2008).

?equivalence sets? of POS tags, shown in Table 4. 
Two tags in the same set are considered parallel, 
even though they do not match.  In many sets, a tag 
needs to be qualified with its dependency relations, 
since it is considered parallel to other members in 
the set only when it plays certain syntactic roles.   
When applying these equivalence sets as well as 
exact matching, the parallel rate increases to 87%. 
The algorithm is of course not perfect9.  It can-
not detect, for example, parallelism involving the 
use of a polysemous character with a ?out-of-
context? meaning (jieyi ??).  For instance, the 
character ? zhe, the fourth character in the second 
line in the couplet10 ????????????,? 
means ?person?. On the surface, it does not match 
its counterpart, ? yan, the fourth character in the 
first line, since yan is a sentence particle and zhe is 
a noun. However, the poet apparently viewed them 
as parallel, because zhe can also function as a sen-
tence particle in other contexts. 
Phrase-level parallelism. The character-level 
metric, however, still rejects some couplets that 
would be deemed parallel by scholars.  Most of 
these couplets are parallel not at the character lev-
el, but at the phrase level. 
A line in a ?recent-style? poem is almost always 
segmented into two syntactic units (Cai, 1998). A 
pentasyllabic (5-character) line is composed of a 
disyllabic unit (the first two characters) followed 
by a trisyllabic unit (the last three characters)11.  
Consider two corresponding disyllabic units, ?? 
bao qin ?hold? ?violin?, and ?? sui diao ?look 
down? ?fish?.  They are tagged as bao/VV qin/NN 
and sui/AD diao/VV, respectively.  There is a 
complete mismatch at the character level: bao is a 
verb but sui is an adverb; qin is a noun but diao is 
a verb.  Taken as a whole, however, both units are 
verb phrases describing an activity (?to hold a vio-
lin? and ?to fish while looking down?), and so the 
poet likely considered them to be parallel at the 
unit, or phrase, level. 
                                                          
9 The quality of these equivalence sets were evaluated on 548 
characters.  The human expert agrees with the decision of the 
algorithm 96.4% of the time at the character level, and 94% of 
the time at the phrase level.

11 Equivalently, the seven characters in the heptasyllabic regu-
lated verse are segmented in a 4+3 fashion.

The dependencies provide a convenient way to 
gauge the level of parallelism at the phrase level.  
One can extract the head word in the correspond-
ing units in the couplet (bao/VV and diao/VV in the 
example above), then compare their POS tags, us-
ing the algorithm for character-level parallelism 
describe above. 
5.3 Results 
The results are shown in Table 5.  All couplets 
from an ?ancient-style? poem are considered ?par-
allelism optional?.  A couplet from a ?recent-style? 
poem with eight or more lines12 is either ?parallel-
ism not expected?, if it is the first or last couplet in 
the poem; or ?parallelism expected?, if it is in the 
middle of the poem.  We first determine whether a 
character is parallel to its counterpart in the couplet 
at the character level; if not, then we back off to 
the phrase level. 
In the ?parallelism expected? category, the cou-
plets of Wang are highly parallel, at both the char-
acter (91%) and phrase levels (95%).  This is 
hardly surprising, given that his poems are highly 
regarded.  It is notable, however, that the propor-
tion is still relatively high (57% at the character 
level) even among those couplets for which paral-
lelism is not expected, suggesting that the poet 
placed a high view on parallelism.  He also em-
ployed much parallelism (64% at the character lev-
el) in ?ancient-style? poems, perhaps to aim at a 
higher artistic effect. 
Among the couplets of Wang which are not par-
allel at the phrase level, the most frequent combi-
nation is a verb phrase matching a noun phrase.  
The verb, as the second character, is modified by 
an adverb; the noun, also as the second character, 
is modified by an adjective.  This implies that the 
?AD VV? vs. ?JJ NN? combination may be con-
sidered to be parallel by poets at the time. 
The trends for Meng are similar, with a signifi-
cantly higher score for couplets expected to be par-
allel than those that are not (82% vs. 53% at the 
character level).  Compared to Wang, however, 
both percentages are lower. One wonders if this 
has any correlation with Meng being commonly 
considered a less accomplished poet.  Since the 
?rules? for parallelism have never been codified, 
                                                          
12 These are known as the ?regulated verse? (lushi ??) and 
are subject to definite patterns of parallelism.  Those with 
fewer lines are left out, since their patterns are less regular. 
Meng may also have simply espoused a more 
coarse-grained view of parts-of-speech.  This hy-
pothesis would be consistent with the fact that, at 
the phrase level, the proportion of parallelism for 
Meng is much closer to that for Wang. This sug-
gests that Meng was content with parallelism at the 
phrase level and emphasized less on matching 
character to character. 
  
 
Table 5. The proportion of characters that are parallel to 
their counterparts in the couplet (see section 5.2). The 
couplets are classified into three types, depending on the 
genre of poetry and their position in the poem (see sec-
tion 5.3). 
6 Conclusion  
We have presented the first large-scale dependency 
treebank of Classical Chinese literature, which en-
codes works by two poets in the Tang Dynasty.  
We have described how the dependency grammar 
framework has been derived from existing tree-
banks for Modern Chinese, and shown a high level 
of inter-annotator agreement.  Finally, we have 
illustrated the utility of the treebank with a study 
on parallelism in Classical Chinese poetry. 
Future work will focus on parsing Classical 
Chinese poems of other poets, and on enriching the 
corpus with semantic information, which would 
facilitate not only deeper study of parallelism but 
also other topics such as imagery and metaphorical 
coherence (Zhu and Cui, 2010).
