Abstract 
 
Machine translation began in 1947 with an 
influential memo by Warren Weaver.  In that 
memo, Weaver noted that human code-breakers 
could transform ciphers into natural language 
(e.g., into Turkish)  
? without access to parallel 
ciphertext/plaintext data, and  
? without knowing the plaintext 
language?s syntax and semantics.   
Simple word- and letter-statistics seemed to be 
enough for the task.  Weaver then predicted that 
such statistical methods could also solve a 
tougher problem, namely language translation.   
This raises the question: can sufficient 
translation knowledge be derived from 
comparable (non-parallel) data? 
 In this talk, I will discuss initial work in 
treating foreign language as a code for English, 
where we assume the code to involve both word 
substitutions and word transpositions.  In doing 
so, I will quantitatively estimate the value of 
non-parallel data, versus parallel data, in terms 
of end-to-end accuracy of trained translation 
systems.  Because we still know very little about 
solving word-based codes, I will also describe 
successful techniques and lessons from the 
realm of letter-based ciphers, where the non-
parallel resources are (1) enciphered text, and (2) 
unrelated plaintext.  As an example, I will 
describe how we decoded the Copiale cipher 
with limited ?computer-like? knowledge of the 
plaintext language.   
 The talk will wrap up with challenges in 
exploiting comparable data at all levels: letters, 
words, phrases, syntax, and semantics.
