There are two basic mysteries about natural lan- 
guage. The speed and ease with which i t  is acquired by 
a ch i ld  and the speed and ease with which i t  is pro- 
cessed. S imi la r ly  to language acquis i t ion,  language 
processing faces a strong input -data-def ic iency pro- 
blem. When we speak we a l te r  a great lo t  in the ideal -  
ized phonological and phonetic representat ions.  We de- 
lete whole phonemes, we rad ica l ly  change allophones, 
we sh i f t  stresses, we break up in tonat iona l  patterns,  
we insert  the pauses at the most unexpected places, 
etc. I f  to th is  cr ippled 'phonological s t r ing '  we add 
a l l  the noise from the surroundings which does not 
help comprehension e i ther ,  i t  is bewildering that  the 
parser is supposed to recognize anything at a l l .  How- 
ever, even in the most d i f f i cu l t  circumstances ( for -  
eign accent, loud environment, being drunk, etc . )  we 
do comprehend speech quick ly  and e f f i c ient ly .  There 
must be then some signals in the phonetic s t r ing which 
are par t i cu la r ly  easy to grasp and to process. I ca l l  
these signals 'p ivots '  and parsers working with these 
signals I cal l  'p ivot  parsers' .  
What are then the pivots in the phonetic str ing? 
I am not proclaiming any heresy by saying that the 
pivots should correspond to the most audible parts of 
the phonetic s t r ing .  I f  we look at the in tens i ty  t rac-  
ing of speech we w i l l  notice a fa i r l y  regular sequence 
of peaks. At the lowest prosodic leve l ,  the level  of 
the sy l lab le ,  these peaks correspond to the vowels 
forming sy l lab ic  nuclei .  In my view, the parser w i l l  
or ient  i t se l f  foremostly on these vocal ic  peaks. That 
is to say, the parser in my model is a 'jumper' which 
recognizes the best audible units of speech - vowels 
bui ld ing sy l lab ic  nuclei - and disregards everything 
else. Such a parser is de f in i te ly  very Fast but i t  is 
also very ine f f i c ient .  Having recognized just  a s t r ing  
of vowels we do not have enough information to f ind a 
word which contains these vowels. Or does anyone sub- 
consciously 'know' which word the st r ing of vowels / 
.a .a . i .e .  / corresponds to?! The parser needs def i -  
n i te ly  more information,  but how much more? This is 
where my hypothesis about ' idea l  prosodic types' comes 
into  play. 
In Dogil: 1985, I argued that at each level  of pro- 
sodic organizat ion there ex is t  p ro to typ ica l ,  unmarked 
structures which manifest themselves not only in pat- 
terns of a l l  natural  languages but are also c lear ly  
v i s ib le  in the areas of external  evidence such as lan- 
guage acquis i t ion,  language loss, and language change. 
Here I w i l l  argue that these ' idea l  prosodic types' 
play an important ro le in language processing. 
At the lowest prosodic level - the level of the 
sy l lab le  - such an ideal type is const i tuted by a CV 
sy l lab le .  That is ,  the proto typ ica l ,  unmarked sy l la -  
ble consist of a s ingle consonant fol lowed by a vowel. 
There is p lenty of evidence for  this prototype (cf .  
Clements & Keyser: 1983, 28f f . ,  Ohala & Kawasaki: 
1984, 115-119). For example: 
- there is no language which would not have CV syl -  
lables, but there are many languages which have on- 
ly CV sy l lab les  
- phonological rules which ob l i te ra te  sy l lab ic  struc- 
ture usually spare CV sy l lables 
- CV sy l lab les  are acquired as f i r s t  in the process 
of language acquis i t ion 
- CV sy l lab les  are preserved even in the most severe 
forms of motor aphasia (cf.  Dogil: 1985) 
- h i s to r i ca l  sy l lab ic  restructur ing rules tend to- 
wards the creat ion of CV sy l \ ]ab les .  
A l l  this evidence c lear ly  i l l us t ra tes  the proto- 
typ ica l  character of t l \ ] is  uni t .  i claim that  th is  
unit is also essential  For p re - lex ica l  parsing. What 
the parser essent ia l l y  does is recognize CV sy l lab les  
in the st r ing.  I propose i t  does this in the fo l low-  
ing way: 
-- The parser searches for  the f i r s t  in tens i ty  
peak and once i t  has found i t  i t  stops there. As 
I said before these in tens i ty  peaks are cotermi- 
nous with vowels (most sonorous sound types) form- 
ing sy l lab ic  nuclei .  The parser goes back in 10 msec. 
steps making a diphone ! of the vowel and the con- 
sonant preceding i t .  This gives a diphonic repre- 
sentat ion of CV sy l lab les .  The di f ference between 
the diphone scanner in my model and in a l l  other 
models is that my scanner works backwards s tar t ing  
at the peak of the vowel. 
- -  The parser recognizes the sy l lab le .  S t r i c t ly  
speaking i t  recognizes only the unmarked, proto- 
typ ica l  CV part of the sy l lab le .  These prototyp-  
ica l  CV's are stored as diphones in the diphone 
d ic t ionary .  I f  the sy l lab le  contains other units ,  
for  example i f  i t  is CCVCC sy l lab le  ( l i ke  in the 
name 'P lanck')  these other units w i l l  be disre-  
garded, and only the CV ( / la /  of /p laok/ )  w i l l  
be ava i lab le  a f ter  the in i t ia l  parse. 
- -  Having ident i f ied  the sy l lab le  the parser 
makes i ts  f i r s t  hypothesis about the word that  
this sy l lab le  is a part of. 
-- The parsing strategy is carr ied on by jump- 
ing to the next in tens i ty  peak, i .e .  the next 
vowel. 
Consider a simple example of a parse by a sy l lab ic  
p ivot  parser of a German sentence "Ich gehe zum Max- 
P lanck - lns t i tu t "  - I am going to the Max-Planck- 
Ins t i tu t :  
(I) \[ ?g gee tsum maks plaok ?institut \] 
I did some simple speech ed i t ing  which monitors the 
'Diphones' are defined as transitions from the 
middle of one phone to the midpoint of the pre- 
ceding one.

function of my parser. From the phonetic st r ing in (1) 
I cl ipped off  the parts of the onset and the codas 
which according to the pivot parser are not processed 
on the in i t ia l  parse. The result ing str ing in (2) was 
fu l l y  recognizable. 
(2) \[ '?i ge tsu ma \[a ?1 t ;  tu \] 
Actually i t  strongly reminded of fast/casual German 
speech. 
When I cl ipped off  these parts of the str ing which 
the pivot parser considers relevant - i .e .  consonants 
immediately preceding the vowels - the str ing was not 
recognizable any more. Consider the t ranscr ipt ion in 
(3): 
(3) \[ i~ ee um aks aqk ins I ut \] 
Actually, some of my informants claimed that i t  was 
not a sentence of the i r  language. Needless to say the 
str ing was not recognizable when the vowels were ob- 
l i te rated .  2 
Given a l l  the grammatical, contextual and back- 
ground knowledge that we possess when parsing str ings,  
the sy l lab ic  v ivot parser might be actual ly su f f i -  
cient for  comprehension. Even i f  i t  is insu f f i c ient  
in the form that I have presented i t  so far ,  i t  is 
fast enough to incorporate a number of repair strate-  
gies that can make i t  su f f i c ient  for comprehension. I
w i l l  just  mention some of these possible repair  s t ra t -  
egies without going into any deta i l .  
1. Phonemic Restoration Strategy - recovers sounds 
which are adjacent to the CV pivot.  For example, in 
case the sy l lab le  / la /  in our example sentence did 
not contain enough information to recognize the cor- 
responding name 'Planck',  the consonant /p/  preceding 
/ la /  and the consonant /~/ fol lowing / la  d would have 
to be recovered by this  repair  strategy. ~ 
2. Pivot parsing at higher prosodic levels - for  in- 
stance recovering ' ideal  types' at the level of the 
foot or the prosodic word. As I understand i t  this 
is exactly what Taft: 1984 has proposed. Another pos- 
s ib le  method here is f inding the patterns of intona- 
t ional  morphemes and pauses and matching these to the 
I did this speech editing using the SPED software 
on PDP Ii. I thank Carla Coenders of the MPl for 
assisting me in speech editing. 
Warren: 1970, who first argued for the Phonemic 
Restoration Strategy, replaced the first phoneme 
/s/ in a word like 'legislature' with a coughing 
sound of about the same intensity as the speech. 
He then presented this word to subjects, and asked 
them to indicate where in the word the cough oc- 
curred. The subjects were unable to accurately lo- 
cate the cough. More important, the missing pho- 
neme was completely 'restored'; that is, it was 
not perceived as missing. The subjects heard the 
/s/ in 'legislature', and the cough was heard as 
background noise. Hence, a listener can generate 
phonemes (given contextual information) that do 
not exist in the speech string. He can do this, I 
would predict, only in these positions that are 
outside of the CV pivot. If we replaced some part 
of the pivot with noise, the subjects would not be 
able to restore it - just as it was the case with 
my example (3).

dialogue structure~ as was proposed in Gibbon: 1985. 
3. Faking advantage of the language spec i f ic  phono- 
tac t i c  constraints - for  example, the fact that in a 
language long vowels may occur only in open syl lables 
takes a great load of f  the parser which has discovered 
a long vowel? 
4. Allophonic f i x ing  of constituent boundaries. l-his 
sort of parsing strategy is central in Church's: 1983 
phonological parser, which I w i l l  have something to 
say about later .  Obviously, because allophones are a 
very much language speci f ic  matter, the allophonic 
parser is also language speci f ic .  
5. Using higher level representational knowledge (mor- 
pho-syntactic and semantic knowledge) in order to re- 
pair  the result  of the prosodic pivot parse - for  ex- 
ample, i f  we parse a word l ike {export} with an in i -  
t ia l  ( i .e .  'nouny' stress) in a syntact ic posit ion of 
a verb, we w i l l  probably not think twice about i ts  
prosodic 'nouniness' but in terpret  i t  as a verb (cf .  
Cutler & Cl i f ton:  1984). I guess we use the s imi lar  
strategy to recover suff ixes which are in i t ia l l y  not 
parsed. 
Most of these parsing strategies presented above 
are language speci f ic ,  and I do not see them as a l te r -  
natives to my pivot parser but as additions to i t .  
The pivot parser which orients i t se l f  on the prototyp- 
ical  l ingu is t i c  units is obviously universal ly appl i -  
cable. 
The pivot parser is fast .  I t  is de f in i te ly  faster  
than the f in i te  state parser developed by Church: 
1983. Church's parser also divides the str ing of 
speech into the sequence of syl lables (and metrlcal 
feet ) .  However, instead of prototypical  pivots i t  
uses the constraints that the sy l lab le  imposes on the 
d i s t r ibut ion  of allophones. I t  is tuned to the analy- 
sis of these phonetic features which are typica l  of 
sy l lab le  in i t ia l  and sy l lab le  f ina l  posit ions.  Church 
has shown that his method greatly reduces the number 
of competing sy l lab ic  analyses compatible with a given 
utterance. Nonetheless, some unresolved ambiguity a- 
bout the correct sy l lab ic  segmentation persists des~ 
pi te the effect  of the phonotactic constraints.  Note 
that the sy l lab ic  pivot parser does not give r ise to 
any ambiguity of this  sort .  The str ings are sy l lab i -  
f ied to the ' idea l '  CV chunks. 
Church's parser is slower than the sy l lab ic  pivot 
parser because i t  has to wait unt i l  i t  reaches the 
sy l lable f ina l  posit ion~in order to f i x  the boundary 
of the recognit ion un i tX  This, in turn, makes the 
parser very ine f f i c ient  and, actual ly ,  inadequate 
given the input-data-def ic iency problem that I dis-  
cussed at the beginning of this paper. The sy l lab le  
f ina l  posit ion that Church's parser c r i t i ca l ly  de- 
pends upon is the most vulnerable posi t ion for  phono- 
logical  obscuration processes (cf .  Dressler: 1984). 
These processes which weaken, ob l i te ra te  or even de- 
lete sy l lab le  f ina l  allophones are very operative in 
natural (par t i cu la r ly  fast/casual)  speech. Thus, i f  
these processes apply and the posit ions which Church's 
parser depends on are not there any more, the parse 
w i l l  break down. I am concluding then that Church's 
All psycholinguistic experiments (cf, Frauenfelder: 
1985 for an overview) speak against this waiting 
strategy. Actually the words are recognized long 
before (2-3 phonemes before) their final segments 
have been processed. 
language specif ic  allophonic parser is slower than my 
universal sy l lab ic  pivot parser and that i t  also faces 
a strong inef f ic iency problem. 
Similar problems apply to a l l  the phonemic parsers. 
As an example let  us discuss a parser assumed in the 
widespread Cohort Model of word recognit ion. The par- 
ser imp l i c i t  in the Cohort Model is a sequential cate- 
gor ia l ,  correct,  phonemic parser (cf .  Frauenfelder: 
1985). I ts purpose is f inding the 'uniqueness point '  
for word recognit ion. Let us assume (af ter  Marslen- 
Wilson: 1984, 141-142) that the word to be recognized 
is "trespass". Given the phonemic information, we can 
determine the point at which "trespass" becomes 
uniquely dist inguishable.  There are many words that 
begin with / i re / ,  and at least two that share the in i -  
t ia l  sequence / i res /  ( t res t le ,  tress) .  But immediate- 
ly fol lowing the /s /  only "trespass" remains. The dis- 
crimination point for  this word is therefore at the 
/p / .  I t  is here, and no later ,  that an optimal system 
should discriminate the word. 
Now, what is the strategy of the pivot parser to 
recognize a word l ike "trespass"? F i rst  i t  w i l l  f ind 
the intens i ty  peak and recognize i t  as the vowel /e / .  
Then i t  w i l l  bind the consonant preceding this vowel 
and recognize i t  as / t r / .  I assume that /~r /  is a mo- 
nosegmental a f f r i cate .  The parser w i l l  recognize the 
f i r s t  sy l lab le  as / i re /  and make a f i r s t  hypothesis a- 
bout the word. The cohort of compatible words w i l l  in- 
clude a l l  the words in Marslen-Wilson's cohort, plus 
some more words that have the in i t ia l  sy l lab le  / s i re /  
(strength, stress, stretch) .  Then the parser w i l l  jump 
to the next intensi ty  peak and recognize i t  as the 
vowel /a / .  I t  w i l l  bind the preceding consonant and 
recognize i t  as /p / .  Now i t  possesses two syl lables 
/~re/ and /pa/ for  the next hypothesis as to word re- 
cognition. This is actual ly enough as there is just  
one word in English containing these two syl lables in 
that order - th is  word is "trespass". 
The whole procedure lasts approximately 400 msec., 
and 4 segments have to be recognized unt i l  the 
'uniqueness point '  has been reached. Hence, nw parser 
is possibly not less e f f i c ient  than the sequential 
phonemic parser, and i ts  uniqueness recognit ion point 
does not come later  than predicted by studies connec- 
ted with the Cohort Model's phonemic parser (cf.  Carl- 
son, Elenius, Granstrom and Hunnicutt: 1985). 
Obviously sy l labic  pivot parser:requires a d i f fe r -  
ent structur ing of the lexicon than the standard pho- 
nemic structur ing imp l i c i t  in the Cohort Model parser. 
Let us imagine a lexicon which is organized according 
to the CV sy l lab ic  pivots.  In order to foster our 
imagination I w i l l  compare such a lexicon to a ware- 
house. Imagine that words are the spare parts that 
the machines (sentences) are made of. Al l  the spare 
parts have screws that keep them together. Imagine now 
that these screws are the prototypical  CV syl lables.  
Our warehouse ( lexicon) is organized according to 
which screws (CV syl lables)  f i t  which spare parts 
(words). I f  you need a spare part (a word), but you 
know only what type of a screw (CV sy l lab le)  you have 
in i t  and what type of machine (context and sentence 
information) i t  might be used in, the warehouse admin- 
i s t ra t ion  (the parser) w i l l  provide you with the spare 
part you have been looking for .  I have been told that 
warehouses organized according to this  pr inc ip le  ac- 
tua l ly  exist  ( in industry) and that they work much 
more e f f i c ient ly  than the warehouses which l i s t  the 
deta i ls  of a l l  of the i r  spare parts. 
There is, however, one major advantage which my 
parser has over any phonemic parser. Phonemic parsers 
require that a l l  decisions on the sensory input are 
always made correct ly .  That is,  every single phoneme 
in the str ing must be correct ly recognized. Given the 
deficiency of the input str ing which I kept mention- 
ing through my paper, tiTis correctness requirement may 
never be fu l f i l l ed  (except maybe in a psychol inguist ic 
lab). 
Even in the most ideal ized and ar t i f i c ia l  labora- 
tory s i tuat ion the acoustic manifestation of many pho- 
nemes depends upon the context. For example, the sec- 
ond formant of /d /  in the sy l lab le  /d i /  has a r is ing 
t rans i t ion ,  whereas in /du/ i t  has a fa l l ing  one. A 
parser which takes no account of the vowel in the syl-  
lable cannot be expected to real ize that a r i s ing  and 
a fa l l ing  t rans i t ion  are cues for the same phoneme. 
My parser does not face this sort of problem be: 
cause the phonological properties i t  is tuned to are 
the most sa l ient  ones from the perceptual point of 
view (cf .  Marcus: 1981)and are best preserved in pho- 
netic str ings.  
I have presented to you an idea of what a fast 
parser which requires the minimum of phonlogical ly in- 
variant information might look l ike .  This parser works 
in a sequential ly- looping manner and the decisions i t  
makes are non-determinist ic.  I t  is universal ly appl i -  
cable, i t  is faster ,  and i t  seems to be no less e f f i -  
cient than other phonological parsers that have been 
proposed.
