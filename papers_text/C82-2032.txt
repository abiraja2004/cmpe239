The ob jec t ive  of  th i s  cont r ibut ion  i s  to  descr ibe  two 
procedures employed in  the quest ion  answering method TIBAQ 
(~ext-and In fe rence-Based  Answering of  ~uest io r  ~, an overa l l

( i )  The procedure of  in fe renc ing  i s  ac t ivated  a f te r  the 
i nput  sentence  has been recogn ized  as a quest ion .  However, i t  
would be use less  to search  through the whole data  base.  Thus 
on ly  a smal l  par t  of  the data  base SQ, v i z .  the set  of  re -  
p resentat ions  of sentences  re levant  wi th  respect  to  a g iven  
quest ion  Q, i s  ac t ivated ,  which cons is ts  of those sentences  
that  conta in  at  leas t  one term sem~ut ica l ly  equ iva lent  w i th  
an element ac tua l ly  occur r ing  in  Q, i .e .  in  the quest ion  to  
be answered. This se t  i s  se lec ted  from the data  base fo r  the  
in fe rence  ru les  to  operate  on i t .  Let us denote by Cn(SQ) the  
set  of  a l l  consequences of  SQ. Thus Cn(SQ) i s  the  theoret i ca l  
se t  of  s ta tements  re levant  fo r  the bu i ld -up  of  the  answer. 
Such a set  of  consequences would grow beyond any l im i ts ,  so 
that  i t  i s  necessary  to fo rmula te  a s t ra tegy  which cont ro l s  
the whole process .  Two d i f fe rent  s t ra teg ies  w i l l  be d i scussed .  
In  the f i r s t  experimen%e wi th  TIBAQ, we  represent  the  
meaning of  the  sentence  by a dependency t ree .  In fe rences  are

performed by us ing  ru les  fo r  nondest ruct ive  cond i t iona l  re -  
wr i t ing  o f  such t rees .  Prom a fo rmal  po in t  o f  v iew a set  o f  
i n fe rence  ru les  can be cons idered  as a se t  of  product ions  
over  o r iented  pro jec t ive  labe l led  t rees .  Labels  are  used fo r  
represent ing  e lementary  terms of  knowledge (meaning) ,  whi le  
p ro~ect iv i ty  permits  a t reatment  of  the  contextua l  ro le  of  
the words in  the  sentence .  For l ingu is t i ca l l y  mot ivated  ru les ,  
which are emphasized in  our paper ,  we can use a bottom-up 
s t ra tegy  car r ied  out here by us ing  Colmerauer?s  Q-systems.  
Such a s t ra tegy  i s  not  fu l l y  sa t i s fac tory  fo r  an in fe rence  
process  cont ro l led  by log ica l  pat te rns .  The log ica l  deduct ive  
ab i l i ty  of  the system should ra ther  be connected w i th  back-  
ward cha in ing  s t ra teg ies  and thus more advanced dev ices ,  
using e .g .  backt rack ing  mechanism, are  needed.  
( i i )  The procedure of  the  search  fo r  an answer to the 
quest ion  Q operates  in  the set  Cn(SQ). A consequence cECn(SQ) 
must fu l f i l  the fo l low ing  cond i t ions  to be chosen as a ( fu l l  
or  par t ia l )  answer to Q: 
(a) the root  of  c must be e i ther  ident i ca l  w i th  the  
root  of  Q ( ident i ty  means co inc idence  in  a l l  par ts  of  the  
complex labe l  of  the node, where "co inc idence"  i s  de f ined  as 
a l low ing  fo r  cer ta in  spec i f i c  d i f fe rences  such as that  of  
s ingu lar  vs .  p lu ra l  under cer ta in  cond i t ions ,  of  an adverb ia l  
o f  Manner vs .  adverb ia l  of  Regard, e tc . ) ,  o r ,  i f  the lex ica l  
part  of  the labe l  of the  root  of  Q equals  "d~lat "  (Eng l i sh  do 
in  the  meaning o f  a fu l l  verb) ,  then the lex ica l  par t  of the 
labe l  of  the root  of  c may have any shape prov ided i t  inc ludes  
and index  denot ing  the feature  "Act iv i ty"  ! 
(b) c must comprise a path that  i s  ident i ca l  w i th  the 
path in  Q that  leads  to the node labe l led  by the representat -  
i on  of  the quest ion  word (WH), except that  the lex ica l  par t  
of  the labe l  of  the counterpar t  of WH in  c cons is ts  in  a con-  
c re te  lex ica l  word, poss ib ly  accompanied by words dependent on 
i t .  
- 140  - 
(c)  ? and Q must have at  leas t  one more node in  common 
(w i th  a co inc id ing  and lex ica l ly  spec i f ied  labe l ) ,  dependent 
on an ident i ca l  node on the path to  WH ( in  c ) .  
I f  there  i s  no c matching the cond i t ions  (a) to  (c ) ,  
th~ system answers I don?t  know. The d i s t inc t ion  between a 
fu l l  and a par t ia l  answer i s  determined as fo l lows :  i f  the 
dependency t rees  of  Q and ? match the cond i t ions  (a) to  (c)  
and Q does not comprise any nods not having a counterpar t  in  
c ,  then _o i s  p r in ted  as a fu l l  answer, o therw ise  i t  i s  p r in t -  
ed as a partial answer, prefixed by "I know that ...". 
This procedure makes it possible to respect among other 
re levant  i ssues  a l so  the dichotomy of  top ic  and focus ,  so that  
e .g .  i f  the set  of  s ta tements  conta ins  the asser t ion  .Ar i thmet -  
i ca l  operat ions  are car r ied  out by the dev ice  D" ( ra ther  than 
"The dev ice  D car r ies  out a r i thmet ica l  operat ions" ) ,  then the 
quest ions  "What i s  car r ied  out by the dev ice  D?" w i l l  be 
answered " I  know that  a r i thmet ica l  operat ions  are car r ied  out 
by the dev ice  D", which po in ts  out the poss ib i l i ty  that  
a r i thmet ica l  operat ions  const i tu te  only an unimportant  par t  
of  the set  of  p rocesses  car r ied  out by D.
