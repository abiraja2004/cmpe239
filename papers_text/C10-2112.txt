Abstract
We demonstrate the use of context fea-
tures, namely, names of places, and un-
labelled data for the detection of per-
sonal name language of origin.
While some early work used either
rule-based methods or n-gram statisti-
cal models to determine the name lan-
guage of origin, we use the discrimi-
native classification maximum entropy
model and view the task as a classifica-
tion task. We perform bootstrapping of
the learning using list of names out of
context but with known origin and then
using expectation-maximisation algo-
rithm to further train the model on
a large corpus of names of unknown
origin but with context features. Us-
ing a relatively small unlabelled cor-
pus we improve the accuracy of name
origin recognition for names written
in Chinese from 82.7% to 85.8%, a
significant reduction in the error rate.
The improvement in F -score for infre-
quent Japanese names is even greater:
from 77.4% without context features to
82.8% with context features.
1 Introduction
Transliteration is a process of rewriting a
word from a source language to a target lan-
guage in a different writing system using the
word?s phonological equivalent. Many techni-
cal terms and proper nouns, such as personal
names, names of places and organisations are
transliterated during translation of a text from
one language to another. A process reverse
to the transliteration, which is recovering a
word in its native language from its translit-
eration in a foreign language, is called back-
transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998). In
many natural language processing (NLP) tasks
such as machine translation and cross-lingual
information retrieval, transliteration is an im-
portant component.
Name origin refers to the language of ori-
gin of a name. For example, the origin of En-
glish name ?Smith? and its Chinese transliter-
ation ???? (Shi-Mi-Si)? is English, while
both ?Tokyo? and ??? (Dong-Jing)? are of
Japanese origin.
For machine transliteration the name origins
dictate the way we re-write a foreign name.
For example, given a name written in Chi-
nese for which we do not have a translation
in an English-Chinese dictionary, we first have
to decide whether the name is of Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, English or another origin.
Then we follow the transliteration rules im-
plied by the origin of the name. Although
all English personal names are rendered in
26 letters, they may come from different ro-
manization systems. Each romanisation sys-
972
tem has its own rewriting rules. English name
?Smith? could be directly transliterated into
Chinese as ???? (Shi-Mi-Si)? since it fol-
lows the English phonetic rules, while the Chi-
nese translation of Japanese name ?Koizumi?
becomes ??? (Xiao-Quan)? following the
Japanese phonetic rules. The name origins
are equally important in back-transliteration.
Li et al (2007b) demonstrated that incorpo-
rating name origin recognition (NOR) into a
transliteration system greatly improves the per-
formance of personal name transliteration. Be-
sides multilingual processing, the name origin
also provides useful semantic information (re-
gional and language information) for common
NLP tasks, such as co-reference resolution and
name entity recognition.
Unfortunately, not much attention has been
given to name origin recognition (NOR) so far
in the literature. In this paper, we are inter-
ested in recognition of the origins of names
written in Chinese, which names can be of
three origins: Chinese, Japanese or English,
where ?English? is a rather broad category that
includes other West European and American
names written natively in Latin script.
Unlike previous work (Qu and Grefenstette,
2004; Li et al, 2007a; Li et al, 2007b),
where NOR was formulated with a genera-
tive model, we follow the approach of Zhang
et al (2008) and regard the NOR task as a
classification problem, using a discriminative
learning algorithm for classification. Further-
more, in the training data with names labelled
with their origin is rather limited, whereas
there is vast data from news articles that con-
tains many personal names without any labels
of their origins. In this research we propose
a method to harness the power of the unla-
belled noisy news data by bootstrapping the
learning process with labelled data and then
using the personal name context in the unla-
belled data to improve the NOR model. We
achieve that by using the maximum entropy
model and the expectation-maximisation train-
ing, and demonstrate that our method can sig-
nificantly improve the accuracy of NOR com-
pared to the baseline model trained only from
the labelled data.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows:
in Section 2 we review the previous research.
In Section 3 we present our approach, and in
Section 4 we describe our experimental setup,
the data used and the evaluation method. We
conclude in Section 5.
2 Related research
Most the research up to date focuses primar-
ily on recognition of origin of names written
in Latin script, called English NOR (ENOR),
although the same methods can be extended to
names in Chinese script (CNOR). We notice
that there are two informative clues that used
in previous work in ENOR. One is the lexi-
cal structure of a romanisation system, for ex-
ample, Hanyu Pinyin, Mandarin Wade-Giles,
Japanese Hepbrun or Korean Yale, each has
a finite set of syllable inventory (Li et al,
2007a). Another is the phonetic and phono-
tactic structure of a language, such as phonetic
composition, syllable structure. For example,
English has unique consonant clusters such
as ?str? and ?ks? which Chinese, Japanese
and Korean (CJK) do not have. Consider-
ing the NOR solutions by the use of these
two clues, we can roughly group them into
two categories: rule-based methods (for solu-
tions based on lexical structures) and statisti-
cal methods (for solutions based on phonotac-
tic structures).
Rule-based method Kuo et al (2007) pro-
posed using a rule-based method to recog-
nise different romanisation system for Chinese
only. The left-to-right longest match-based
lexical segmentation was used to parse a test
word. The romanisation system is confirmed
973
if it gives rise to a successful parse of the test
word. This kind of approach (Qu and Grefen-
stette, 2004) is suitable for romanisation sys-
tems that have a finite set of discriminative
syllable inventory, such as Pinyin for Chinese
Mandarin. For the general tasks of identifying
the language origin and romanisation system,
rule based approach sounds less attractive be-
cause not all languages have a finite set of dis-
criminative syllable inventory.
N-gram statistics methods
N-gram sum method Qu and Grefenstette
(2004) proposed a NOR identifier us-
ing a trigram language model (Cavnar
and Trenkle, 1994) to distinguish per-
sonal names of three language origins,
namely Chinese, Japanese and English.
In their work the training set includes
11,416 Chinese, 83,295 Japanese and
88,000 English name entries. How-
ever, the trigram is defined as the joint
probability p(cici?1ci?2) rather than the
commonly used conditional probability
p(ci|ci?1ci?2). Therefore it is basically
a substring unigram probability. For ori-
gin recognition of Japanese names, this
method works well with an accuracy of
92%. However, for English and Chinese,
the results are far behind with a reported
accuracy of 87% and 70% respectively.
N-gram perplexity method Li et al (2007a)
proposed a method of NOR using n-gram
character perplexity PPc to identify the
origin of names written in Latin script.
Using bigrams, the perplexity is defined
as
PPc = 2
?1
Nc
?Nc
i=1 log p(ci|ci?1)
whereNc is the total number of characters
in a given name, ci is the i-th character
in the name and p(ci|ci?1) is the bigram
probability learned from a list of names
of the same origin. Therefore, PPc can
be used to measure how well a new name
fits the model learned from the training
set of names. The origin is assigned ac-
cording to the model that gives the lowest
perplexity value. Li et al (2007a) demon-
strated that using PPc gives much better
performance than with the substring uni-
gram method.
Classification method Zhang et al (2008)
proposed using a discriminative classification
approach and extract features from the names.
They use Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model
and a number of features based on n-grams,
character positions, word length as well as
some rule-based phonetic features. They per-
formed both ENOR and CNOR and demon-
strated that their method indeed leads to better
performance in name origin recognition then
the n-gram statistics method. They attribute
that to the fact their model incorporates more
robust features than the n-gram statistics based
models.
In this paper we too follow the discriminat-
ing classification approach, but we add fea-
tures based on the context of a personal name.
These features require the original text with the
names to be available. Our approach closely
models the real-life situation when large cor-
pora of articles with personal names is read-
ily available in the Web, yet the origins of the
names are unknown.
3 Model and training methods
3.1 Maximum entropy model for NOR
The principle of maximum entropy is that
given a collection of facts we should choose
a model that is consistent with all the facts but
otherwise as uniform as possible (Berger et al,
1996). maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) is
known to easily combine diverse features and
974
has been used widely in natural language pro-
cessing research. Given an observation x the
probability of outcome label ci, i = 1 . . . N
given x is given by
p(ci|x) =
1
Z exp
?
?
n?
j=1
?jfj (x, ci)
?
? (1)
where N is the number of the outcome labels,
which is the number of name origins in our
case, n is the number of features, fj are the
feature functions and ?j are the model param-
eters. Each parameter corresponds to exactly
one feature and can be viewed as a ?weight?
for the corresponding feature. Z is the normal-
isation factor given by
Z =
N?
i=1
p(ci|x) (2)
In the problem at hand x is a personal name
and all the features are binary. The features,
also known as contextual predicates, are in the
form
fi(x, c) =
{
1 if c = ci and cp(x) = true
0 otherwise
(3)
where cp is the contextual predicate that maps
a pair (ci, x) to {true, false}.
In our experiments we use Zhang?s maxi-
mum entropy library1.
3.2 Initial training with labelled data and
n-gram features
For the initial training of MaxEnt model we
use labelled data: personal names of Chinese,
Japanese or English origin written in Chinese.
The origin of each name is known. Following
paper by Zhang et al (2008) and their findings
1http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/
maxent toolkit.html
regarding the contribution value of each fea-
ture that they studied, we extract unigram, po-
sitional unigram and word length features. For
example, Chinese name ????? has the fol-
lowing features:
??? (?,0) (?,1) (?,2) 3
We restrict the n-gram features to unigram
only to avoid the data sparseness, because our
data contains a number of Chinese surnames
and given names, which have a length of one
or two characters.
3.3 Further training with unlabelled data
and context features
For further training of MaxEnt model we use
unlabelled data collected from news articles.
The name origin is not known but each per-
sonal name is in a context and is often sur-
rounded by names of places that may give a
hint about the personal name origin. For each
personal name we extract all names of places
in the same paragraph and use them as fea-
tures. If a place name is repeated many times
in the same paragraph we only include it once
in the feature list.
For example, paragraph containing passage
?The U.S. President Barack Obama ...? will
result in two personal names ?Barack? and
?Obama? having ?U.S.? as their context fea-
ture. Due to the diversity of place names we
also attempt to map the names of the places
into the country names. In this case, features
like ?U.S.?, ?USA?, ?America? are manually
substituted with ?USA?. In our experiments we
also try to narrow the place name extraction
to windows of different sizes surrounding the
personal name. The rationale here is that the
closer a place name is to the personal name,
the more likely it has a connection to the ori-
gin of the personal name.
In summary, our algorithm includes two
steps.
975
First, we use the boostrap data and n-gram,
positional n-gram and name length features to
do the initial training (the 0-th iteration) of
MaxEnt model with L-BFGS method (Byrd et
al., 1995). After that we use the model to as-
sign origin labels to names of the training set
of the unlabelled data.
Next, we use both the bootstrap data and
the training set of the unlabelled data, labelled
in the previous step, and add the context fea-
tures to the already used n-gram, positional n-
gram and name length features. Since there is
no context available for the bootstrap data, the
context features for it are missing, which can
be handled by the MaxEnt model. We perform
the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) iterations
by using the mixed data to train the i-th itera-
tion of the MaxEnt model, then use the model
to re-label the training set of the unlabelled
data and repeat the training of the model for
the (i + 1)-st iteration. We stop the iterations
when the ratio of patterns that change the ori-
gin labels becomes less than 0.01%.
4 Experiments
4.1 Corpora
The corpora consists of two datasets. One
dataset, called the ?bootstrap data?, is a set of
Chinese, Japanese and English names written
in Chinese following the respective translitera-
tion rules according to the name origins. The
names are a mixture of full names, first (given)
names and surnames. Table 1 shows the num-
ber of names of each origin. This is the la-
belled data; the origin of each name is known.
The data is used to start the MaxEnt model
training.
The second dataset, called the ?unlabelled
data?, is Chinese, Japanese and English per-
sonal names written in Chinese, which have
been extracted from the news articles col-
lected over 6 months from Xinhua news web-
site. The articles have been processed by an

automatic part-of-speech (POS) tagger, after
which personal names and names of places
have been manually identified (the latter for
extracting the context features). Normally the
first (given) name and surnames are identi-
fied as two separate personal names. The data
is split into a training set of 27,882 names
with unknown origin and a testing set of 1,476
names whose origin was manually assigned.
We split data in such a way that there is no
overlap between patterns in the training and
testing sets, although there may be overlap be-
tween names. For example, if a name may
be present in both training and testing sets but
in a different context, making the two names
two distinct patterns. The number of names
of each origin in the testing set is shown in
Table 2. As seen from the table, the number

of Chinese names exceeds the number of En-
glish or Japanese names. This is an expected
consequence of using articles from a Chinese
news agency because many of the articles are
reporting on local affairs. We have manually
removed a number of Chinese name patterns
from the testing set, since the original percent-
age of Chinese names in the articles is about
83%.

4.2 Evaluation method
Following Zhang et al (2008) to make
our results comparable to theirs, we eval-
uate our system using precision Po, recall
Ro and F -score Fo for each origin o ?
{?Chinese ?? ?Japanese ?? ?English ??}. Let
the number of correctly recognised names of
a given origin o be ko, and the total number of
names recognised as being of origin o be mo,
while the actual number of names of origin o
be no. Then the precision, recall and F -score
are given as:
Po =
ko
mo
Ro =
ko
no
Fo =
2? Po ?Ro
Po +Ro
We also report the overall accuracy of the sys-
tem (or, rather the overall recall), which is the
ratio of the total number of correctly recog-
nised names to the number of all names:
Acc = kChinese + kJapanese + kEnglishnChinese + nJapanese + nEnglish
4.3 Results
After each iteration of our MaxEnt-based EM
algorithm, we record the number of patterns in
the training set that changed their origin labels,
as well as calculate the precision, recall and
F -score for each origin as well as the overall
accuracy. The results are reported in Tables 3
and 4, where for the sake of brevity the origin
subscripts are ?C?, ?J? and ?W? for Chinese,
Japanese and English name origin respectively.
Compared to the 0-th iteration there is an
significant improvement in accuracy, particu-
larly in recognition of Japanese names, which
are relatively infrequent compared to Chinese
and English ones in the unlabelled training
data. This clearly shows the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

5 Conclusions
We propose extension of MaxEnt model for
NOR task by using two types of data for train-
ing: origin-labelled names alone and origin-
unlabelled names in their context surrounding.
We show how to apply a simple EM method to
make use of the contextual words as features,
and improve the NOR accuracy from 82.9%
to 84.9% overall, while for rare names such
as Japanese the effect of using unlabelled data
with context features is even greater.
The purpose of this research is to demon-
strate how the unlabelled data can be used. In
the future we hope to investigate the use of
other context features, as well as to study the
effect of data size on the NOR accuracy im-
provement.
The feature of names? places normally ex-
hibit great variation: one country name may be
spelled in many different ways, and often there
are names of cities etc that surround personal
names. We will explore to normalise names
of places by substituting each name with name
of the country where the place is in the future
work.
