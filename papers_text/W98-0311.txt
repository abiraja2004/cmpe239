Some Exotic Discourse Markers of Spoken Dialog 
Nige l  Ward  1 
Un ivers i ty  o f  Tokyo  
Abst rac t :  In Japanese and English conver- 
sation corpora we have found an interesting 
discourse marker: a 110 millisecond region of 
low pitch region, which can cue back-channel 
feedback from the hearer. We have also found 
that many back-channel responses appear to be 
more explainable if considered not as words, but 
as complex sounds which directly convey dis- 
course functions with sotmd symbolism. 
c) coming after at least 700ms of speech, 
d) providing you have not output back-channel 
feedback within the preceding 1.0 seconds, 
e) after 350ms wait 
you should produce back-channel feedback. 
Our model for English is the same except for some 
parameters: pitch level (clause a) 26th-percentile, re- 
covery time (clause d) 800ms, and delay (clause e) 
700ms. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Back-channel feedback, also called "listener re- 
sponses'~ is, to a first approximation, those responses 
produced by one participant which do not interfere 
with utterances by the other participant. In Ameri- 
can English yeah, mm and uh huh are typical back- 
channel feedback. In Japanese un is most typical. 
This paper summarizes ome findings on back- 
channels and their cues, as primitive examples of dis- 
course markers in spoken dialog. Definitions, details, 
discussion, and references appear elsewhere (Ward 
1996; ~Vard 1998; Ward & Tsukahara to appear: 
~vVard submitted; Ward & Tsukahara 1998). The 
findings arose from our corpora of unrestricted two- 
person conversations in Japanese and in American 
English, and might not apply to ta,sk-directed is- 
courses, small talk, multi-party conversations, and 
conversations with audiences. 
2 A Cue for Back-channel Feedback 
In Japanese and in English, the prosody of the 
speaker's utterances can mark times when the lis- 
tener is welcome to produce back-channel feedback. 
One specific cue is a region of low pitch. Behavior of 
Japanese listeners can be modeled with the following 
rule: 
Upon detection of 
a) a region of pitch less than the 28th-percentile 
pitch level and 
b) continuing for at least 110ms,

3 Corpus -based  Eva luat ion  
We have tested the predictions of the above rule 
against a corpus of ca~sual, mostly friendly Japanese 
conversations between mostly students (80 minutes 
total). 
The rule gave a coverage of 56(~ (of 873 back- 
channels in the corpus, the rule predicted 496, using 
a 500 ms tolerance) and an accuracy of 34~ (of 1447 
predictions, 496 were correct). This did better than a 
rule which makes predictions at random (while obey- 
ing clauses c, d, and e), both on average (Table 1), 
and for most speakers in most conversations: in 34 
cases out of 36 (2 sides times 18 conversations) the 
figure of nlerit (namely the product of coverage and 
accuracy) was higher for the low pitch rule. 
Analysis of the false predictions for Japanese sug- 
gests that roughly half are due to inter-speaker dif- 
ferences in back-channel behavior; this is the source 
of the "'eavesdropping" estimate. 
Similar results were obtained for a corpus of 68 
minutes of English conversation data for the English 
rule (Table 2), although the accuracy was much lower, 
suggesting that in English factors other than low 
pitch are relatively more important han in Japanese. 
4 Informal Exper iments 
We have also tested the performance of the rules in 
live conversation, mostly over the telephone. We used 
a human decoy to start the conversation. After the 
subject started talking, the decoy shut up and the 
system took over, producing back-channel feedback 
in response to regions of low pitch, This feedback 
was un  for Japanese and a random selection between 
uh-huh and mm for English. \~  used pre-recorded 
samples of the decoy's voice to make it impossible for

and the system's output. If the conversation flagged. 
the decoy would speak up with another question or 
comment o get the subject talking again. 
We have done a few dozen runs in both Japanese 
and English. In general third party judges listen- 
ing to the conversations could distinguish the low 
pitch based aizuchis from randomly produced ones: 
the former sounded natural and the latter sounded 
odd, with clear cases of inappropriate aizuchis and 
of inappropriate silences when an alzuchi was called 
for. However, those who were actually talking to the 
system were apparently seldom aware of nor affected 
much by when or whether back-channels were pro- 
duced. 
5 Communicat ive Functions 
The 110ms low pitch region has no single fixed mean- 
ing or function, at least in our data. 
One thing it often co-occurs with is completion of 
a grammatical clause. Here it often seems to serve 
as an indication that the speaker considers that he 
has transmitted some new information, and so the 
hearer is welcome to confirm receipt or understand- 
ing or interest, with a back-channel. (We can think 
of it as conveying "this completes that thought, did 
you follow?") Sometimes what has been transmit- 
ted is a complete new fact or proposition, but often 
it is the introduction of just enough information for 
the listener to infer the speaker's point, especially 
in Japanese. In such causes back-channel feedback 
can appear before the speaker has completed a gram- 
marital phrase or logical proposition, and sometimes 
back-channel feedback ill such causes rakes the form of 
completing the speaker's thought or sentence. 
The low pitch region also often co-occurs with rep- 
etitions of a word previously spoken, produced for 
emphasis or clarity and/or when recovering from a 
false start, especially in English. In such cases it often 
welcomes back-channel feedback, perhaps conveying 
"'I said it again, did you get it that time?" 
The low pitch region also occurs frequently with 
disfluencies and markers of formulation difficulties, 
especially in English. In these cases we can imag- 
ine that the low pitch region conveys, "I'm stuck. 
but keep listening, something meaningful will come 
out soon". It also occasionally occurs as a speaker 
takes the floor. In some of these cases, especially for 
Japanese, it elicits back-channel feedback, presum- 
ably as encouragement to continue. 
Another place where the low pitch region often 
occurs is together with back-channel feedback itself. 
Such cases of back-channel feedback themselves oc- 
casionally elicit a confirmatory word or sigh. 
6 Co-occurr ing Markers 
The low pitch cue tends to occur together with other 
discourse markers. 
63 
It co-occurs frequently with specific lexical items, 
as one would expect from the communicative func- 
tions identified in the previous section. In Japanese 
it often occurs with clause connectives (most com- 
monly kara, -te and kedo), with 'agreement seeking 
sentence-final particles', especially he, and with the 
back-channel un. In English the association with spe- 
cific lexical items is less strong, but the low pitch re- 
gion falls most frequently on the (almost always in 
the lengthened, unreduced pronunciation indicating 
difficulty finding the next word to say), and, and urn. 
The low pitch region is often followed by silence 
at the end of a speaker's utterance. The energy 
drop that marks the start of this silence is, counter- 
intuitively, not much of a cue for back-channel feed- 
back, providing little or no information beyond that 
provided by the low pitch cue, as seen in the tables 
(results are for a rule which predicts a back-channel in
response to 150ms of silence, subject to clauses c, d. 
and e of the corresponding low pitch rule). This also 
implies that the low pitch region is often a valid cue 
even when it appears in the middle of an utterance. 
The low pitch region occasionally segues into a 
rise in intonation (uptalk). This seems to turn an 
invitation for feedback into a demand for it. 
The low pitch cue sometimes co-occurs with vowel 
lengthening. This may be a consequence of the need 
to produce a low pitch region of sufficient length, in 
those cases where there is.only a single syllable of 
lexical content to work with, for example with ne 
('you know'). 
Gaze, posture, and facial and hand gestures also 
may correlate with low pitch regions. 
Given all these correlations, it is natural to won- 
der whether it is necessary to invoke a notion of low 
pitch cue to explain the data. We have found that 
no other single factor can for all the occurrences of 
back-channels that low pitch regions can; to say nmre 
will require further analysis. 
7 Responses Evoked 
There have been many studies of the lexical items 
used in back-channels and the types of semantic func- 
tions served thereby. 
This section discusses one problematic subset of 
back-channels, those sounds which do not seem to 
be words, For example, in the Japanese corpus, in 
addition to the ubiquitous un, there is also uu, uh, 
uun, ununun, huun, huh. hmrnm, hrn-um, and over a 
hundred other items not found in dictionaries, with 
diverse prosody and voicing. In English, there is a 
family containing uh-huh, um-hm, uh-hrn, hm, hmm, 
mm, un, and ahhh. and another containing okay, kay, 
and n-kay. 
Rather than consider each of these a distinct 
lexical item, a nmre parsimonious account may be 
reached by means of the following hypotheses: A: 
these sounds are not fixed sequences of phonemes, 
but are formed for each occasion from basic acoustic 
components; B: these acoustic components individ- 
ually bear meanings; C: the meaning of a combina- 
tion of acoustic omponents i  the combination of the 
meanings of each component. 
Some specific hypothesized meanings, 
for Japanese and possibly English too, are agreement 
for na.salization, contemplation for m, deference for 
breathiness and h, willingness to listen for number of 
syllables, and coldness for sharpness of final energy 
drop. In addition energy and pitch height and slope 
appear to bear the usual meanings. 
If these hypotheses are correct, then these con- 
versational sounds are "iconic', or, in other words, 
involve "sound symbolism" or 'synaesthesia'. This 
discourse-functionM system of sound symbolism ap- 
pears to be distinct from the onomatopoeic and 
mimetic systems Of sound symbolism.

Examination of simple markers for some cross- 
speaker discourse relations in spoken dialog has 
shown that  prosody plays an important role. An 
important next topic is study of the interplay be- 
tween prosodic discourse markers and lexical dis- 
course markers.
