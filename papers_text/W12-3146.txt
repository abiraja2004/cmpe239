Abstract
We present an improved version of DEPFIX
(Marec?ek et al, 2011), a system for auto-
matic rule-based post-processing of English-
to-Czech MT outputs designed to increase
their fluency. We enhanced the rule set used
by the original DEPFIX system and measured
the performance of the individual rules.
We also modified the dependency parser of
McDonald et al (2005) in two ways to adjust
it for the parsing of MT outputs. We show that
our system is able to improve the quality of the
state-of-the-art MT systems.
1 Introduction
The today?s outputs of Machine Translation (MT)
often contain serious grammatical errors. This
is particularly apparent in statistical MT systems
(SMT), which do not employ structural linguistic
rules. These systems have been dominating the area
in the recent years (Callison-Burch et al, 2011).
Such errors make the translated text less fluent and
may even lead to unintelligibility or misleading
statements. The problem is more evident in lan-
guages with rich morphology, such as Czech, where
morphological agreement is of a relatively high im-
portance for the interpretation of syntactic relations.
The DEPFIX system (Marec?ek et al, 2011) at-
tempts to correct some of the frequent SMT sys-

tems? errors in English-to-Czech translations.1 It an-
alyzes the target sentence (the SMT output in Czech
language) using a morphological tagger and a de-
pendency parser and attempts to correct it by apply-
ing several rules which enforce consistency with the
Czech grammar. Most of the rules use the source
sentence (the SMT input in English language) as a
source of information about the sentence structure.
The source sentence is also tagged and parsed, and
word-to-word alignment with the target sentence is
determined.
In this paper, we present DEPFIX 2012, an im-
proved version of the original DEPFIX 2011 system.
It makes use of a new parser, described briefly in
Section 3, which is adapted to handle the generally
ungrammatical target sentences better. We have also
enhanced the set of grammar correction rules, for
which we give a detailed description in Section 4.
Section 5 gives an account of the experiments per-
formed to evaluate the DEPFIX 2012 system and
compare it to DEPFIX 2011. Section 6 then con-
cludes the paper.
2 Related Work
Our approach can be regarded as converse to the
more common way of using an SMT system to auto-
matically post-edit the output of a rule-based transla-
tion system, as described e.g. in (Simard et al, 2007)
or (Lagarda et al, 2009).
The DEPFIX system is implemented in the
1Although we apply the DEPFIX system just to SMT systems
in this paper as it mainly targets the errors induced by this type
of MT systems, it can be applied to virtually any MT system
(Marec?ek et al, 2011).

TectoMT/Treex NLP framework (Popel and
Z?abokrtsky?, 2010),2 using the Morc?e tagger (Spous-
tova? et al, 2007) and the MST parser (McDonald
et al, 2005) trained on the CoNLL 2007 Shared
Task English data (Nivre et al, 2007) to analyze the
source sentences. The source and target sentences
are aligned using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).
3 Parsing
The DEPFIX 2011 system used the MST parser (Mc-
Donald et al, 2005) with an improved feature set
for Czech (Nova?k and Z?abokrtsky?, 2007) trained on
the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) 2.0 (Hajic?
and others, 2006) to analyze the target sentences.
DEPFIX 2012 uses a reimplementation of the MST
parser capable of utilizing parallel features from the
source side in the parsing of the target sentence.
The source text is usually grammatical and there-
fore is likely to be analyzed more reliably. The
source structure obtained in this way can then pro-
vide hints for the target parser. We use local features
projected through the GIZA++ word alignment ? i.e.
for each target word, we add features computed over
its aligned source word, if there is one.
To address the differences between the gold stan-
dard training data and SMT outputs, we ?worsen?
the treebank used to train the parser, i.e. introduce
errors similar to those found in target sentences:
The trees retain their correct structure, only the word
forms are modified to resemble SMT output.
We have computed a ?part-of-speech tag er-
ror model? on parallel sentences from the Prague
Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT) 2.0
(Bojar et al, 2012), comparing the gold standard
Czech translations to the output of an SMT system
(Koehn et al, 2007) and estimating the Maximum
Likelihood probabilities of errors for each part-of-
speech tag. We then applied this error model to the
Czech PCEDT 2.0 sentences and used the resulting
?worsened? treebank to train the parser.
4 Rules
DEPFIX 2012 uses 20 hand-written rules, address-
ing various frequent errors in MT output. Each
rule takes an analyzed target sentence as its in-
put, often together with its analyzed source sen-
2http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex
tence, and attempts to correct any errors found ?
usually by changing morphosyntactic categories of
a word (such as number, gender, case, person and
dependency label) and regenerating the correspond-
ing word form if necessary, more rarely by deleting
superfluous particles or auxiliary words or changing
the target dependency tree structure. However, nei-
ther word order problems nor bad lexical choices are
corrected.
Many rules were already present in DEPFIX 2011.
However, most were modified in DEPFIX 2012 to
achieve better performance (denoted as modified),
and new rules were added (new). Rules not modified
since DEPFIX 2011 are denoted as reused.
The order of rule application is important as there
are dependencies among the rules, e.g. FixPrepo-
sitionNounAgreement (enforcing noun-preposition
congruency) depends on FixPrepositionalCase (fix-
ing incorrectly tagged prepositional case). The rules
are applied in the order listed in Table 2.
4.1 Analysis Fixing Rules
Analysis fixing rules try to detect and rectify tagger
and parser errors. They do not change word forms
and are therefore invisible on the output as such;
however, rules of other types benefit from their cor-
rections.
FixPrepositionalCase (new)
This rule corrects part-of-speech-tag errors in
prepositional phrases. It looks for all words that de-
pend on a preposition and do not match its part-of-
speech tag case. It tries to find and assign a com-
mon morphological case fitting for both the word
form and the preposition. Infrequent preposition-
case combinations are not considered.
FixReflexiveTantum (new)
If the word form ?se? or ?si? is classified as reflex-
ive tantum particle by the parser, but does not be-
long to an actual reflexive tantum verb (or a dever-
bative noun or an adjective), its dependency label is
changed to a different value, based on the context.
FixNounNumber (reused)
If a noun is tagged as singular in target but as plu-
ral in source, the tag is likely to be incorrect. This
rule tries to find a tag that would match both the
363
source number and the target word form, changing
the target case if necessary.
FixPrepositionWithoutChildren (reused)
A target preposition with no child nodes is clearly
an analysis error. This rule tries to find children for
childless prepositions by projecting the children of
the aligned source preposition to the target side.
FixAuxVChildren (new)
Since auxiliary verbs must not have child nodes,
we rehang all their children to the governing full
verb.
4.2 Agreement Fixing Rules
These rules relate to morphological agreement re-
quired by Czech grammar, which they try to enforce
in case it is violated. Czech grammar requires agree-
ment in morphological gender, number, case and
person where applicable.
These rules typically use the source sentence only
for confirmation.
FixRelativePronoun (new)
The Czech word relative pronoun ?ktery?? is as-
signed gender and number identical to the closest
preceding noun or pronoun, if the source analysis
confirms that it depends on this noun/pronoun.
FixSubject (modified)
The subject (if the subject dependency label is
confirmed by the source analysis) will have its case
set to nominative; the number is changed if this leads
to the word form staying unchanged.
FixVerbAuxBeAgreement (modified)
If an auxiliary verb is a child of an infinitive, the
auxiliary verb receives the gender and number of the
subject, which is a child of the infinitive (see also
FixAuxVChildren).
FixSubjectPredicateAgreement (modified)
An active verb form receives the number and per-
son from its subject (whose relation to the verb must
be confirmed by the source).
FixSubjectPastParticipleAgreement (modified)
A past participle verb form receives the number
and gender from its subject (confirmed by the source
analysis).
FixPassiveAuxBeAgreement (modified)
An auxiliary verb ?by?t? (?to be?) depending on a
passive verb form receives its gender and number.
FixPrepositionNounAgreement (modified)
A noun or adjective depending on a preposition
receives its case. The dependency must be con-
firmed in the source.
FixNounAdjectiveAgreement (modified)
An adjective (or an adjective-like pronoun or nu-
meral) preceding its governing noun receives its
gender, number and case.
4.3 Translation Fixing Rules
The following rules detect and correct structures of-
ten mistranslated by SMT systems. They usually de-
pend heavily on the source sentence.
FixBy (new)
English preposition ?by? is translated to Czech us-
ing the instrumental case (if modifying a verb, e.g.
?built by David?: ?postaveno Davidem?) or using the
genitive case (if modifying a noun, e.g. ?songs by
David?: ?p??sne? Davida?).
FixPresentContinuous (modified)
If the source sentence is in a continuous tense (e.g.
?Ondr?ej isn?t experimenting.?), the auxiliary verb ?to
be? must not appear on the output, which is often
the case (e.g. *?Ondr?ej nen?? experimentovat.?). This
rule deletes the auxiliary verb in target and transfers
its morphological categories to the main verb (e.g.
?Ondr?ej neexperimentuje.?).
FixVerbByEnSubject (new)
If the subject of the source sentence is a personal
pronoun, its following morphological categeries are
propagated to the target predicate:
? person
? number (except for ?you?, which does not ex-
hibit number)
? gender (only in case of ?he? or ?she?, which ex-
hibit the natural gender)
FixOf (new)
English preposition ?of? modifying a noun is
translated to Czech using the genitive case (e.g. ?pic-
tures of Rudolf?: ?obra?zky Rudolfa?).
364
FixAuxT (reused)
Reflexive tantum particles ?se? or ?si? not belong-
ing to any verb or adjective are deleted. This situa-
tion usually occurs when the meaning of the source
verb/adjective is lost in translation and only the par-
ticle is produced.
4.4 Other Rules
VocalizePrepos (reused)
Prepositions ?k?, ?s?, ?v?, ?z? are vocalized (i.e.
changed to ?ke?, ?se?, ?ve?, ?ze?) where neces-
sary. The vocalization rules in Czech are similar to
?a?/?an? distinction in English.
FixFirstWordCapitalization (new)
If the first word of source is capitalized and the
first word of target is not, this rule capitalizes it.
5 Experiments and Results
For parameter tuning, we used datasets from the
WMT10 translation task and translations by ON-
LINEB and CU-BOJAR systems.
5.1 Manual Evaluation
Manual evaluation of both DEPFIX 2011 and DEP-
FIX 2012 was performed on the WMT113 test set
translated by ONLINEB. 500 sentences were ran-
domly selected and blind-evaluated by two indepen-
dent annotators, who were presented with outputs of
ONLINEB, DEPFIX 2011 and DEPFIX 2012. (For
246 sentences, at least one of the DEPFIX setups
modified the ONLINEB translation.) They provided
us with a pairwise comparison of the three setups,
with the possibility to mark the sentence as ?indef-
inite? if translations were of equal quality. The re-
sults are given in Table 1.
In Table 2, we use the manual evaluation to mea-
sure the performance of the individual rules in DEP-
FIX 2012. For each rule, we ran DEPFIX 2012 with
this rule disabled and compared the output to the
output of the full DEPFIX 2012. The number of
affected sentences on the whole WMT11 test set,
given as ?changed?, represents the impact of the
rule. The number of affected sentences selected for
manual evaluation is listed as ?evaluated?. Finally,

(suggesting whether the rule improved or worsened
the translation, or whether the result was indefinite)
were counted and divided by the number of anno-
tators to get the average performance of each rule.
Please note that the lower the ?evaluated? number,
the lower the confidence of the results.
The inter-annotator agreement matrix for com-
parison of ONLINEB + DEPFIX 2012 (denoted as
Setup 1) with ONLINEB (Setup 2) is given in Ta-
ble 3. The results for the other two setup pairs were
similar, with the average inter-annotator agreement
being 77%.
5.2 Automatic Evaluation
We also performed several experiments with auto-
matic evaluation using the standard BLEU metric
(Papineni et al, 2002). As the effect of DEPFIX in
terms of BLEU is rather small, the results are not as
confident as the results of manual evaluation.4
In Table 4, we compare the DEPFIX 2011 and
DEPFIX 2012 systems and measure the contribution
of parser adaptation (Section 3) and rule improve-
ments (Section 4). It can be seen that the com-
bined effect of applying both system modifications
is greater than when they are applied alone. The im-
provement of DEPFIX 2012 over ONLINEB without
DEPFIX is statistically significant at 95% confidence
level.
The effect of DEPFIX 2012 on the outputs of some
of the best-scoring SMT systems in the WMT12
Translation Task5 is shown in Table 5. Although
DEPFIX 2012 was tuned only on ONLINEB and CU-
BOJAR system outputs, it improves the BLEU score
of all the best-scoring systems, which suggests that
4As already noted by Marec?ek et al (2011), BLEU seems
not to be very suitable for evaluation of DEPFIX. See (Kos and
Bojar, 2009) for a detailed study of BLEU performance when
applied to evaluation of MT systems with Czech as the target
language.

6 Conclusion
We have presented two improvements to DEPFIX,
a system of rule-based post-editing of English-to-
Czech Machine Translation outputs proven by man-
ual and automatic evaluation to improve the qual-
ity of the translations produced by state-of-the-art
SMT systems. First, improvements in the existing
rules and implementation of new ones, which can be
regarded as an additive, evolutionary change. Sec-
ond, a modified dependency parser, adjusted to pars-
ing of SMT outputs by training it on a parallel tree-
bank with worsened word forms on the Czech side.
We showed that both changes led to a better perfor-
mance of the new DEPFIX 2012, both individually
and combined.
In future, we are planning to incorporate deeper
analysis, devising rules that would operate on the
deep-syntactic, or tectogrammatical, layer. The
Czech and English tectogrammatical trees are more
similar to each other, which should enable us to ex-
ploit more information from the source sentences.
We also hope to be able to perform more complex
corrections, such as changing the part of speech of a
word when necessary.
Following the success of our modified parser, we
would also like to modify the tagger in a similar way,
since incorrect analyses produced by the tagger of-
ten hinder the correct function of our rules, some-
times leading to a rule worsening the translation in-
stead of improving it.
As observed e.g. by Groves and Schmidtke (2009)
for English-to-German and English-to-French trans-
lations, SMT systems for other language pairs also
tend to produce reoccurring grammatical errors. We
believe that these could be easily detected and cor-
rected in a rule-based way, using an approach similar
to ours.
