Abstract 
This paper presents our work for partici-
pation in the Third International Chinese 
Word Segmentation Bakeoff. We apply 
several processing approaches according 
to the corresponding sub-tasks, which are 
exhibited in real natural language. In our 
system, Trigram model with smoothing 
algorithm is the core module in word 
segmentation, and Maximum Entropy 
model is the basic model in Named En-
tity Recognition task. The experiment 
indicates that this system achieves F-
measure 96.8% in MSRA open test in the 
third SIGHAN-2006 bakeoff. 
1 Introduction 
Word is a logical semantic and syntactic unit in 
natural language. Unlike English, there is no de-
limiter to mark word boundaries in Chinese lan-
guage, so in most Chinese NLP tasks, word seg-
mentation is a foundation task, which transforms 
Chinese character string into word sequence. It is 
prerequisite to POS tagger, parser or further ap-
plications, such as Information Extraction, Ques-
tion Answer system. 
Our system participated in the Third Interna-
tional Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, 
which held in 2006. Compared with our system 
in the last bakeoff (Jiang 2005A), the system in 
the third bakeoff is adjusted intending to have a 
better pragmatic performance. This paper mainly 
focuses on describing two sub-tasks: (1) The ba-
sic Word Segmentation; (2) Named entities rec-
ognition. We apply different approaches to solve 
above two tasks, and all the modules are inte-
grated into a pragmatic system (ELUS). 
2 System Description 
All the words in our system are categorized into 
five types: Lexicon words (LW), Factoid words 
(FT), Morphologically derived words (MDW), 
Named entities (NE), and New words (NW). 
Figure 1 demonstrates our system structure.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The input character sequence is converted into 
one or several sentences, which is the basic deal-
ing unit. The ?Basic Segmentation? is used to 
identify the LW, FT, MDW words, and ?Named 
Entity Recognition? is used to detect NW words. 
We don?t adopt the New Word detection algo-
rithm in our system in this bakeoff. The ?Disam-
biguation? module performs to classify compli-
cated ambiguous words, and all the above results 
are connected into the final result, which is de-
noted by XML format. 
2.1 Trigram and Smoothing Algorithm 
We apply the trigram model to the word segmen-
tation task (Jiang 2005A), and make use of Ab-
solute Smoothing algorithm to overcome the 
sparse data problem. 
Trigram model is used to convert the sentence 
into a word sequence. Let w = w1 w2 ?wn be a 
word sequence, then the most likely word se-
quence w* in trigram is: 
?

where let P(w0|w-2 w-1) be P(w0) and let P(w1|w-1 
w0) be P(w1|w0), and wi represents LW or a type 
of FT or MDW. In order to search the best seg-
mentation way, all the word candidates are filled 
in the word lattice (Zhao 2005). And the Viterbi

algorithm is used to search the best word seg-
mentation path.  
FT and MDW need to be detected when con-
structing word lattice (detailed in section 2.2). 
The data structure of lexicon can affect the effi-
ciency of word segmentation, so we represent 
lexicon words as a set of TRIEs, which is a tree-
like structure. Words starting with the same 
character are represented as a TRIE, where the 
root represents the first Chinese character, and 
the children of the root represent the second 
characters, and so on (Gao 2004). 
When searching a word lattice, there is the 
zero-probability phenomenon, due to the sparse 
data problem. For instance, if there is no cooc-
curence pair ???/?/???(we eat bananas) in 
the training corpus, then P(??|????) = 0. 
According to formula (1), the probability of the 
whole candidate path, which includes ???/?/
??? is zero, as a result of the local zero prob-
ability. In order to overcome the sparse data 
problem, our system has applied Absolute Dis-
counting Smoothing algorithm (Chen, 1999).

The notation N1+ is meant to evoke the number 
of words that have one or more counts, and the ?  
is meant to evoke a free variable that is summed 
over. The function ()c  represents the count of 
one word or the cooccurence count of multi-
words. In this case, the smoothing probability

Because we use trigram model, so the maxi-
mum n may be 3. A fixed discount D (0 ?D ? 1) 
can be set through the deleted estimation on the 
training data. They arrive at the estimate

nD +=                                              (5) 
where n1 and n2 are the total number of n-grams 
with exactly one and two counts, respectively. 
After the basic segmentation, some compli-
cated ambiguous segmentation can be further 
disambiguated. In trigram model, only the previ-
ous two words are considered as context features, 
while in disambiguation processing, we can use 
the Maximum Entropy model fused more fea-
tures (Jiang 2005B) or rule based method. 
2.2 Factoid and Morphological words 
All the Factoid words can be represented as regu-
lar expressions. So the detection of factoid words 
can be achieved by Finite State Automaton(FSA). 
In our system, the following categories of factoid 
words can be detected, as shown in table 1.

Deterministic FSA (DFA) is efficient because 
a unique ?next state? is determined, when given 
an input symbol and the current state. While it is 
common for a linguist to write rule, which can be 
represented directly as a non-deterministic FSA 
(NFA), i.e. which allows several ?next states? to 
follow a given input and state.  
Since every NFA has an equivalent DFA, we 
build a FT rule compiler to convert all the FT 
generative rules into a DFA. e.g.  
z ?< digit > -> [0..9]; 
z < year > ::= < digit >{< digit >+}??; 
z < integer > ::= {< digit >+}; 
where ?->? is a temporary generative rule, and 
?::=? is a real generative rule. 
As for the morphological words, we erase the 
dealing module, because the word segmentation 
definition of our system adopts the PKU standard. 
3 Named Entity Recognition 
We adopt Maximum Entropy model to perform 
the Named Entity Recognition. The extensive 
evaluation on NER systems in recent years (such 
as CoNLL-2002 and CoNLL-2003) indicates the 
best statistical systems are typically achieved by 
using a linear (or log-linear) classification algo-
rithm, such as Maximum Entropy model, to-
gether with a vast amount of carefully designed 
linguistic features. And this seems still true at 
present in terms of statistics based methods. 
Maximum Entropy model (ME) is defined 
over H? T in segmentation disambiguation, 
where H is the set of possible contexts around 
target word that will be tagged, and T is the set of 
allowable tags, such as B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, 
I-LOC etc. in our NER task. Then the model?s 
conditional probability is defined as 
190

),(),( ???                              (7) 
where h is the current context and t is one of the 
possible tags.  
The several typical kinds of features can be 
used in the NER system. They usually include 
the context feature, the entity feature, and the 
total resource or some additional resources.  
Table 2 shows the context feature templates. 
Table2 NER feature template1 
Type Feature Template 
One order feature wi-2, wi-1, wi, wi+1, wi+2 
Two order feature wi-1:i, wi:i+1 
NER tag feature t i-1 
While, we only point out the local feature 
template, some other feature templates, such as 
long distance dependency templates, are also 
helpful to NER performance. These trigger fea-
tures can be collected by Average Mutual Infor-
mation or Information Gain algorithm etc. 
Besides context features, entity features is an-
other important factor, such as the suffix of Lo-
cation or Organization. The following 8 kinds of 
dictionaries are usually useful (Zhao 2006): 
Table 3 NER resource dictionary2  
List Type Lexicon Example 
Place lexicon ??, ??, ???Word list 
Chinese surname ?, ?, ?, ?? 
Prefix of PER ?, ?, ? 
Suffix of PLA ?, ?, ?, ?, ? String list 
Suffix of ORG ?, ??, ??, ? 
Character for CPER ?,?, ?, ?, ? 
Character for FPER ?, ?, ?, ?, ? Character list 
Rare character ?, ?, ? 
In addition, some external resources may im-
prove the NER performance too, e.g. we collect a 
lot of entities for Chinese Daily Newspaper in 
2000, and total some entity features. 
However, our system is based on Peking Uni-
versity (PKU) word segmentation definition and 
PKU NER definition, so we only used the basic 
features in table 2 in this bakeoff.  Another effect 
is the corpus: our system is training by the Chi-
nese Peoples? Daily Newspaper corpora in 1998, 
which conforms to PKU NER definition. In the 
section 4, we will give our system performance 
with the basic features in Chinese Peoples? Daily 
Newspaper corpora.

4 Performance and analysis 
4.1 The Evaluation in Word Segmentation 
The performance of our system in the third bake-
off is presented in table 4 in terms of recall(R), 
precision(P) and F score in percentages. The 
score software is standard and open by SIGHAN. 
Table 4 MSRA test in SIGHAN2006 (%) 
MSRA R P F OOV Roov Riv
Close 96.3 91.8 94.0 3.4 17.5 99.1
Open 97.7 96.0 96.8 3.4 62.4 98.9
Our system has good performance in terms of 
Riv measure. The Riv measure in close test and in 
open test are 99.1% and 98.9% respectively. This 
good performance owes to class-based trigram 
with the absolute smoothing and word disam-
biguation algorithm. 
In our system, it is the following reasons that 
the open test has a better performance than the 
close test: 
(1) Named Entity Recognition module is 
added into the open test system. And Named En-
tities, including PER, LOC, ORG, occupy the 
most of the out-of-vocabulary words. 
(2) The system of close test can only use the 
dictionary that is collected from the given train-
ing corpus, while the system of open test can use 
a better dictionary, which includes the words that 
exist in MSRA training corpus in SIGHAN2005. 
And we know, the dictionary is the one of impor-
tant factors that affects the performance, because 
the LW candidates in the word lattice are gener-
ated from the dictionary. 
As for the dictionary, we compare the two col-
lections in SIGHAN2005 and SIGHAN2006, and 
evaluating in SIGHAN2005 MSRA close test. 
There are less training sentence in SIGHAN2006, 
as a result, there is at least 1.2% performance 
decrease. So this result indicates that the diction-
ary can bring an important impact in our system. 
Table 5 gives our system performance in the 
second bakeoff. We?ll make brief comparison. 
Table 5 MSRA test in SIGHAN 2005 (%) 
MSRA R P F OOV Roov Riv
Close 97.3 94.5 95.9 2.6 32.3 99.1
Open 98.0 96.5 97.2 2.6 59.0 99.0
Comparing table 4 with table 5, we find that 
the OOV is 3.4 in third bakeoff, which is higher 
than the value in the last bakeoff. Obviously, it is 
one of reasons that affect our performance. 
In addition, based on pragmatic consideration, 
our system has been made some simplifier, for 
instance, we erase the new word detection algo-
rithm and the is no morphological word detection.

4.2 Named Entity Recognition 
In MSRA NER open test, our NER system is 
training in prior six-month corpora of Chinese 
Peoples? Daily Newspaper in 1998, which were 
annotated by Peking University. Table 6 shows 
the NER performance in the MSRA open test. 
Table 6 The NER performance in MSRA Open test 
MSRA NER Precision Recall  F Score 
PER 93.68% 86.37% 89.87 
LOC 85.50% 59.67% 70.29 
ORG 75.87% 47.48% 58.41 
Overall 86.97% 65.56% 74.76 
As a result of insufficiency in preparing bake-
off, our system is only trained in Chinese Peo-
ples? Daily Newspaper, in which the NER is de-
fined according to PKU standard. However, the 
NER definition of MSRA is different from that 
of PKU, e.g, ???/LOC ???, ??/PER ?
/PER??? in MSRA, are not entities in PKU. 
So the training corpus becomes a main handicap 
to decrease the performance of our system, and it 
also explains that there is much difference be-
tween the recall rate and the precision in table 6. 
Table 7 gives the evaluation of our NER sys-
tem in Chinese Peoples? Daily Newspaper, train-
ing in prior five-month corpora and testing in the 
sixth month corpus. We also use the feature tem-
plates in table 2, in order to make comparison 
with table 6. 
Table 7 The NER test in Chinese Peoples? Daily 
MSRA NER Precision Recall  F Score 
CPN 93.56 90.96 92.24 
FPN 90.42 86.47 88.40 
LOC 91.94 90.52 91.22 
ORG 88.38 84.52 86.40 
Overall 91.35 88.85 90.08 
This experiment indicates that our system can 
have a good performance, if the test corpus and 
the training corpora conform to the condition of 
independent identically distributed attribution. 
4.3 Analysis and Discussion 
Some points need to be further considered: 
(1) The dictionary can bring a big impact to 
the performance, as the LW candidates come 
from the dictionary. However a big dictionary 
can be easily acquired in the real application. 
(2) Due to our technical and insufficiently 
preparing problem, we use the PKU NER defini-
tion, however they seem not unified with the 
MSRA definition. 
(3) Our NER system is a word-based model, 
and we have find out that the word segmentation 
with two different dictionaries can bring a big 
impact to the NER performance. 
(4) We erase the new word recognition algo-
rithm in our system. While, we should explore 
the real annotated corpora, and add new word 
detection algorithm, if it has positive effect. e.g. 
???  ??(lotus prize) can be recognized as one 
word by the conditional random fields model. 
5 Conclusion 
We have briefly described our word segmenta-
tion system and NER system. We use word-
based features in the whole processing. Our sys-
tem has a good performance in terms of Riv 
measure, so this means that the trigram model 
with the smoothing algorithm can deal with the 
basic segmentation task well. However, the result 
in the bakeoff indicates that detecting out-of-
vocabulary word seems to be a harder task than 
dealing with the segmentation-ambiguity task. 
The work in the future will concentrate on two 
sides: improving the NER performance and add-
ing New Word Detection Algorithm.
