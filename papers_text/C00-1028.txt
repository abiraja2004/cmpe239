tim nlt',asur(; of scmmlt;ic well-forlnedness, in- 
v('stigating SI ) might hel l) us to understand the 
structure of the mental lexicon. 
Systems for mlsupervised learning of SP usu- 
ally combine statistical aim knowledge-1)ased 
approaches. The knowledge-base component 
is typicMly a database that  groups words into 
classes. In the models w(' will see. the knowl- 
edge base is Wordnet (Miller, 1990). Word- 
net groups nouns into c, lasses of synonyms 
ret)resenting concel)ts , called synsets ,  e.g., 
{car,,,'ld, o,a, 'utomobilc,. . .}. A noun that lm- 
hmgs to sew:ral synsets is ambiguous .  A t ran-  
187 
sitive and asymmetrical relation, hyponymy,  
is defined between synsets. A synset is a hy- 
ponym of another synset if the tbrmer has the 
latter as a broader concept; for example, BEV- 
ERAGE is a hyponym of LIQ UID. Figure 1 de- 
picts a portion of the hierarchy. 
The statistical component consists of 
predicate-argument pairs extracted from a 
corpus in which the semantic lass of the words 
is not indicated. A trivial algorithm might 
get a list of words that occurred as objects 
of the verb and output the semantic classes 
the words belong to according to Wordnet. 
For example, if the verb drink occurred with 
'water and water E L IQUID,  the nlodel would 
learn that drink selects tbr LIQUID. As Resnik 
(1997) and abney and Light (1999) have found, 
the main problem these systems face is the 
presence of ambiguous words in the training 
data. If the word java also occurred as an 
object of drink, since java C BEVERAGE 
and java C ISLAND,  this model would learn 
that drink selects tbr both BEVERAGE and 
ISLAND.  
More complex models have been t)roposed. 
These models, though, deal with word sense 
ambiguity by applying an unselective strategy 
similar to the one above; i.e., they assmne that 
anfl)iguous words provide equal evidence tbr all 
their senses. These models choose as the con- 
eepts the verb selects tbr those that are in com- 
mon among several words (e.g., BEVERAGE 
above). This strategy works to the extent that 
these overlapping senses are also the concepts 
the verb selects tbr. 
2 Prev ious  approaches to learn ing  
se lect iona l  preference 
2.1 P~esnik's model 
Ours system is closely related to those proposed 
in (Resnik, 1997) and (Atmey and Light, 1999). 
The fact; that a predicate p selects for a class 
c, given a syntactic relation r, can be repre- 
sented as a relation, selects(p, r, c); e.g., that 
eat selects for FOOD in object position can 
be represented as selects(eat, object, FOOD). 
In (Resnik, 1997) selectional preference is quan- 
tiffed by comparing the prior distribution of 
a given class c appearing as an argument, 
P(c)~ and the conditional probability of |;lie 
same class given a predicate and a syntac- 
COGNI770N 1/4 FOOD 7/4 
ESSENCE 1/4 FLESH 1/4 FRUH" 1/2 BREAD I/2 DAIRY I/2 
l' J l l l 
idea(O) meal(l) apple(I) bagel(l) cheese(l) 
Figure 2: Simplified Wordnet. The numbers 
next to the synsets represent he values of 
freq(p, r, c) estimated using (3), the nmnbers in 
l)arentheses represent the values of frcq(p, r, w). 
tic relation P(c\[p,r),  e.g., P(FOOD) and 
J ( OODleat, object), The relative ntropy be- 
tween P(c) and P(clp, r) measures how nmch 
the predicate constrains its arguments: 
S(p,r) = D(P(clp, r) II P(c)) (1) 
Resnik defines the se lect ional  assoc iat ion of 
a predicate for a particular class c to be the por- 
tion of the selectional preference strength due to 
that class: 
P(clP, ~') 1 P(clp , r) log (2) A(p,, . ,  c) - S(v, , ' )  P(c)  
Here the main problem is the estimation of 
P(clp, r). Resnik suggests  as  a plausil)le esti- 
mator /5(clp, r) de=r freq(p, r, c)/freq(p, r). 13ut 
since the model is trained on data that are not 
sense-tagged, there is no obvious way to esti- 
mate freq(p, r, c). Resnik suggests considering 
each observation of a word as evidence tbr each 
of the classes |;lie word belongs to, 
count(p, r, w) 
c) aasses(w) (3) 
~uc:e 
where count(p, r, w) is the nmnber of times 
the word w occurred as an argument of p in 
relation r, and classes(w) is the number of 
classes w belongs to. For exmnple, suppose 
the system is trained on (eat, object) pairs and 
the verb occurred once each with meat, ap- 
ple, bagel, and cheese, and Wordnet is simpli- 
fied as in Figure 2. An ambiguous word like 
meat provides evidence also tbr classes that ap- 
pear unrelated to those selected by the verb. 
Resnik's assumption is that only the classes e- 
lected by the verb will be associated with each

Atmey and Light dis(:overed that the EM al- 
goril;hm tinds t)arameter wflues that associate 
some t)rol)ability mass with all the trmlsitions 
in the lnultil)le paths that lead to an ambigu- 
ous word. In other words, when there are sev- 
eral state sequences fi)r the same word, \]DM does 
not select one of l;hen: over the others. I Figure 3 
shows the I)arameters esl;imated by EM for the 
same examt)le as above. The transit ion to the 
COGNITION sl;ate has \])een assigne(t a t)rol)a-

frequen(:y of oceurren(:e of an aml)iguous word

this is a serious l)roblem, par|;i(:iilarly when l;he 
aml)iguous word is a ti'equent one, and cruised 
the model to learn the wrong seleel;ional pref- 
eren('es. To (:orre(:i; this undesiral)le outcome 
they introduced some smoothing and t)alam:ing

knowledge base. The verb occurred with java 
and water. This situation can be ret)resented 
as a Bayesian network. The variables ISLAND 
and BEVERAGE represent concepts in a se- 
mantic hierarchy. The wtriables java and water 
stand for I)ossible instantiations of the concet)ts. 
All the w,riables are Boolean; i.e., they are as- 
sociated with two states, true or false. Suppose 
the tbllowing CPTs define the priors associated 
with each node. 2 The unconditional probabili- 
ties are P ( I  = t,'~,,e) = P (B  = t,'~,,~0 = 0.01 and 
P( I  = false) = I"(13 = false) = 0.99, and the 
CPTs for the child nodes are 
I =>)  I 
1,13 1, ~13 ~I,13 -~I, ~f3 
j = true 0.99 (I.99 0.99 0.01 
j = false 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.99 
w = true 0.99 0.99 0.01 (I.01 
w false. 0.01 0.01 0.99 0.99 
These vahms mean that the occu,'rence of either 
concept is a priori unlikely. If either concept is 
true the word java is likely to occur. Similarly, 
if BE VERA GE occurs it; is likely to observe also 
the word water. As the posterior probabilities 
show, if java occurs, the belief~ in both concepts 
increase: P(II.j) = P(B I j  ) = 0.3355. However, 
'water provides evidence for BEVERAGE only. 
Overall there is more evidence for the hypoth- 
esis that the concept being expressed is BEV- 
ERAGE and not ISLAND. Bayesian networks 
implement his inference scheme; if we compute 
the conditional probabilities given that both 
words occurred, we obtain P(BI j  , w) = 0.98 and 
P(I\[ j ,  w) = 0.02. The new evidence caused the 
"island" hyt)othesis to be explained away! 
3.1 The relevance of priors 
Explaining away seems to depend on the spec- 
ification of the prior prolmt)ilities. The priors 
2I, 13, j and w abbrev ia te  ISLAND, 1lEVERAGE, 
java and water, respect ively.

define the background knowledge awdlable to 
the model relative to the conditional probabili- 
ties of the events represented by the variables, 
but also about the joint distributions of several 
events. In the simple network above, we de- 
fined the probat)ility that either concept is se- 
lected (i.e., that the correst)onding variable is 
true) to be extremely small. Intuitively, there 
are many concepts and the probability of ob- 
serving any particular one is small. This means 
that the joint probability of the two events is 
much higher in the case in which only one of 
them is true (0.0099) than in the case in which 
they are both true (0.0001). Therefore, via the 
priors, we introduced a bias according to which 
the hypothesis that one concept is selected will 
be t/wored over two co-occurring ones. This is a 
general pattern of Bayesian networks; the prior 
causes impler explanations to be preferred over 
more complex ones, and thereby the explaining 
away effect. 
4 A Bayesian network approach to 
learning select ional  preference 
4.1 Structure and parameters of the 
model 
The hierarchy of nouns in Wordnet defines a 
DAG. Its mapping into a BBN is straightibr- 
ward. Each word or synset in Wordnet is a 
node in the network. If A is a hyponym of B 
there is an are in the network from B to A. All 
the variables are Boolean. A synset node is true 
if the verb selects for that class. A word node is 
true if the word can appear as an argument of 
the verb. The priors are defined tbllowing two 
intuitive principles. First, it is unlikely that a 
verb a priori selects for troy particular synset. 
Second, if a verb does select for a synset, say 
FOOD, then it; is likely that it also selects tbr 
190 
i(;s hyl)onyms, say FR.UFI'. The sam(', l>rin(:il)les 
;H)t)Iy (;o words: it is likely l;h~t a wor(t ;q)I)ears 
as an m:gmnent of t,h(; verl) if the vert) seh;(:l;s for 
any of il;s possible senses. On l;he other h~m(t, 
if (,he verb does nol; selecl; for a synsel;, it; is 
'u, nlikely that  the words insl;anl;b~l;ing (;he synse(;

network with variables X1,..., Xn, its joint dis-

tional probabilities pecified in the network,

where pa(X) is the set of parents of X. A BBN 
generates a factorization of the joint distribu- 
tion over its variables. Consider a network of 
three nodes A, B~ C with arcs fl'om A to \]5 and 
C. Its joint distribution can be characterized as 
P(A, B, C) = P(A)P(BIA)P(CIA ). If there is 
no evidence for C the joint distribution is 
P(A ,B ,C)  = P(A)P(BIA ) ~ P(CIA ) 
c 
= P(A)P(B IA  ) 
= P(A, B) 
The node C gets marginalized out. Marginaliz- 
ing over a childless node is equivalent o remov- 
ing it with its connections from the network. 
Therefore the subnetworks are equivalent to the 
whole network; i.e., they have the same joint 
distribution. 
Our model comtmtes the value of P(c\[p,r), 
lint we did not compute the prior P(c) for all 
n(mns in the cortms. We assumed this to be 
a constant, equal to the 'u'nlihcly wflue, for all 
classes. In a BBN the wdues of the marginals 
increase with their distance fl'om the root nodes. 
To avoid undesired bias (see table of results) we 
defined a balancing formula that adjusted the 
conditional probabilities of the CPTs in such a 
way that we got; all tim marginals to have ap- 
proximately the same wdue)

When trained on t)redicate-argument pairs ex- 
tracted from a large corpus, the San .Jose Mer- 
cury Corpus, the model gave very good results. 
The corpus contains about 1.a million verb- 
object tokens. The obtained rankings of classes 
according to their posterior marginal probabili- 
ties were good. Table 1 shows the top and the

of other plausible classes, hyponynls of I/EHI - 
CLE. It also learned that the verb does not 
select for direct; objects that are inembers of 
(:lasses, like CONCEPT or PItILOSOPltY. 
5.2 Word  sense d i sambiguat ion  test  
A direct ewfluation measure for unsupervised 
learning of SP models does not exist. These 
lnodels are instead evaluated on a word-sense 
disambiguation test (WSD). The idea is that 
systems that learn SP produce word sense dis- 
amt)iguation as a side-effect. Java might be in- 
terl)reted as the island or the beverage, but in a 
context like "the tourists flew to Java" the for- 
mer seems more correct, because fly could select 
for geographic locations but not for beverages. 
A system trained on a predicate p should he 
able to disambiguate arguments of p if it has 
learned its selectional restrictions. 
We tested our model using the test and 
training data developed by Resnik (see Resnik, 
1997). The same test was used in (Almey 
and Light, 1999). The training data consists 
of predicate-object ounts extracted fl'oln 4/5 
of the Brown corpus (at)out 1M words). The 
test set consists of predicate-object pairs from 
the remaining 1/5 of the corpus, which has 
been manually sense-annotated by Wordnet re- 
searchers. The results are shown in Table 2. 
The baseline algorithm chooses at random one 
of the multiple senses of an ambiguous word. 
The "first sense" method always chooses the 
most frequent sense (such a system should be 
trained on sense-tagged data). Our model per-
