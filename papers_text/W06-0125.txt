Abstract  
This paper briefly describes our system in the 
third SIGHAN bakeoff on Chinese word 
segmentation and named entity recognition. 
This is done via a word chunking strategy 
using a context-dependent Mutual 
Information Independence Model. 
Evaluation shows that our system performs 
well on all the word segmentation closed 
tracks and achieves very good scalability 
across different corpora. It also shows that 
the use of the same strategy in named entity 
recognition shows promising performance 
given the fact that we only spend less than 
three days in total on extending the system in 
word segmentation to incorporate named 
entity recognition, including training and 
formal testing. 
1  Introduction 
Word segmentation and named entity recognition 
aim at recognizing the implicit word boundaries 
and proper nouns, such as names of persons, 
locations and organizations, respectively in plain 
Chinese text, and are critical in Chinese 
information processing.  However, there exist two 
problems when developing a practical word 
segmentation or named entity recognition system 
for large open applications, i.e. the resolution of 
ambiguous segmentations and the identification 
of OOV words or OOV entity names.  
In order to resolve above problems, we 
developed a purely statistical Chinese word 
segmentation system and a named entity 
recognition system using a three-stage strategy 
under an unified framework.  
The first stage is called known word 
segmentation, which aims to segment an input 
sequence of Chinese characters into a sequence of 
known words (called word atoms in this paper). In 
this paper, all Chinese characters are regarded as 
known words and a word unigram model is 
applied to perform this task for efficiency.  Also, 
for convenience, all the English characters are 
transformed into the Chinese counterparts in 
preprocessing, which will be recovered just 
before outputting results. 
The second stage is the word and/or named 
entity identification and classification on the 
sequence of atomic words in the first step. Here, a 
word chunking strategy is applied to detect words 
and/or entity names by chunking one or more 
atomic words together according to the word 
formation patterns of the word atoms and optional 
entity name formation patterns for named entity 
recognition. The problem of word segmentation 
and/or entity name recognition are re-cast as 
chunking one or more word atoms together to 
form a new word and/or entity name, and a 
discriminative Markov model, named Mutual 
Information Independence Model (MIIM), is 
adopted in chunking. Besides, a SVM plus 
sigmoid model is applied to integrate various 
types of contexts and implement the 
discriminative modeling in MIIM. 
The third step is post processing, which tries 
to further resolve ambiguous segmentations and 
unknown word segmentation. Due to time limit, 
this is only done in Chinese word segmentation. 
No post processing is done on Chinese named 
entity recognition. 
The rest of this paper is as follows: Section 2 
describes the context-dependent Mutual 
Information Independence Model in details while 
purely statistical post-processing in Chinese word 
segmentation is presented in Section 3. Finally, 
we report the results of our system in Chinese 
word segmentation and named entity recognition 
in Section 4 and conclude our work in Section 5.

2 Mutual Information Independence 
Model  
In this paper, we use a discriminative Markov 
model, called Mutual Information Independence 
Model (MIIM) as proposed by Zhou et al(2002), 
for Chinese word segmentation and named entity 
recognition. MIIM is derived from a conditional 
probability model. Given an observation sequence 
n
n oooO L211 = , MIIM finds a stochastic optimal 
state(tag) sequence nn sssS L211 =  that 
maximizes:

We call the above model the Mutual 
Information Independence Model due to its 
Pair-wise Mutual Information (PMI) assumption 
(Zhou et al2002). The above model consists of 
two sub-models: the state transition model

probability-based classifier, such as a maximum 
entropy classifier or a SVM plus sigmoid 
classifier (Zhou et al2006).  In this competition, 
the SVM plus sigmoid classifier is used in 
Chinese word segmentation while a simple 
backoff  approach as described in Zhou et al
(2002) is used in named entity recognition. 
Here, a variant of the Viterbi algorithm 
(Viterbi 1967) in decoding the standard Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner 1989) is 
implemented to find the most likely state 
sequence by replacing the state transition model 
and the output model of the standard HMM with 
the state transition model and the output model of 
the MIIM, respectively. The above MIIM has 
been successfully applied in many applications, 
such as text chunking (Zhou 2004), Chinese word 
segmentation ( Zhou 2005), English named entity 
recognition in the newswire domain (Zhou et al
2002) and the biomedical domain (Zhou et al
2004; Zhou et al2006). 
For Chinese word segmentation and named 
entity recognition by chunking, a word or a entity 
name is regarded as a chunk of one or more word 
atoms and we have: 
? >=< iii wpo , ; iw is the thi ?  word atom in 
the sequence of word atoms nn wwwW L211 = ; 
ip  is the word formation pattern of the word 
atom iw . Here ip  measures the word 
formation power of the word atom iw  and 
consists of: 
o The percentage of iw  occurring as a whole 
word (round to 10%) 
o The percentage of iw  occurring at the 
beginning of other words (round to 10%) 
o The percentage of iw  occurring at the end 
of other words (round to 10%) 
o The length of iw  
o Especially for named entity recognition, 
the percentages of a word occurring in 
different entity types (round to 10%). 
? is : the states are used to bracket and 
differentiate various types of words and 
optional entity types for named entity 
recognition. In this way, Chinese word 
segmentation and named entity recognition 
can be regarded as a bracketing and 
classification process. is  is structural and 
consists of two parts: 
o Boundary category (B): it includes four 
values: {O, B, M, E}, where O means that 
current word atom is a whOle word or 
entity name and B/M/E means that current 
word atom is at the Beginning/in the 
Middle/at the End of a word or entity name. 
o Unit category (W): It is used to denote the 
type of the word or entity name.  
Because of the limited number of boundary 
and unit categories, the current word atom 
formation pattern ip  described above is added 
into the state transition model in MIIM. This 
makes the above MIIM context dependent as 
follows:

3 Post Processing in Word 
Segmentation 
The third step is post processing, which tries to 
resolve ambiguous segmentations and false 
unknown word generation raised in the second 
step. Due to time limit, this is only done in 
Chinese word segmentation, i.e. no post 
processing is done on Chinese named entity 
recognition. 
155
A simple pattern-based method is employed to 
capture context information to correct the 
segmentation errors generated in the second steps. 
The pattern is designed as follows: 
<Ambiguous Entry (AE)> | <Left Context, 
Right Context> => <Proper Segmentation> 
The ambiguity entry (AE) means ambiguous 
segmentations or forced-generated unknown 
words. We use the 1st and 2nd words before AE as 
the left context and the 1st and 2nd words after AE 
as the right context. To reduce sparseness, we also 
only use the 1st left and right words as context. 
This means that there are two patterns generated 
for the same context. All the patterns are 
automatically learned from training corpus using 
the following algorithm.

(5) Generating disambiguation patterns using

different right hand side.

4 Evaluation 
We first develop our system using the PKU data 
released in the Second SIGHAN Bakeoff last 
year. Then, we train and evaluate it on the Third 
SIGHAN Bakeoff corpora without any 
fine-tuning. We only carry out our evaluation on 
the closed tracks. It means that we do not use any 
additional knowledge beyond the training corpus. 
Precision (P), Recall (R), F-measure (F), OOV 
Recall and IV Recall are adopted to measure the 
performance of word segmentation. Accuracy 
(A), Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F) 
are adopted to measure the performance of NER. 
Tables 1, 2 and 3 in the next page report the 
performance of our algorithm on different corpus 
in the SIGHAN Bakeoff 02 and Bakeoff 03, 
respectively. For the performance of other 
systems, please refer to 
http://sighan.cs.uchicago.edu/bakeoff2005/data/r
esults.php.htm for the Chinese bakeoff 2005 and 
http://sighan.cs.uchicago.edu/bakeoff2006/longst
ats.html for the Chinese bakeoff 2006.  
Comparison against other systems shows that 
our system achieves the state-of-the-art 
performance on all Chinese word segmentation 
closed tracks and shows good scalability across 
different corpora. The small performance gap 
should be able to overcome by replacing the word 
unigram model with the more powerful word 
bigram model. Due to very limited time of less 
than three days, although our NER system under 
the unified framework as Chinese word 
segmentation does not achieve the 
state-of-the-art, its performance in NER is quite 
promising and provides a good platform for 
further improvement. Error analysis reveals that 
OOV is still an open problem that is far from to 
resolve. In addition, different corpus defines 
different segmentation principles. This will stress 
OOV handling in the extreme. Therefore a system 
trained on one genre usually performances worse 
when faced with text from a different register. 
5 Conclusion 
This paper proposes a purely unified statistical 
three-stage strategy in Chinese word 
segmentation and named entity recognition, 
which are based on a context-dependent Mutual 
Information Independence Model. Evaluation 
shows that our system achieves the 
states-of-the-art segmentation performance and 
provides a good platform for further performance 
improvement of Chinese NER.
