Abstract
In this study, we explore several popular
techniques for obtaining corpora for decep-
tion research. Through a survey of tra-
ditional as well as non-gold standard cre-
ation approaches, we identify advantages
and limitations of these techniques for web-
based deception detection and offer crowd-
sourcing as a novel avenue toward achiev-
ing a gold standard corpus. Through an in-
depth case study of online hotel reviews,
we demonstrate the implementation of this
crowdsourcing technique and illustrate its
applicability to a broad array of online re-
views.
1 Introduction
Leading deception researchers have recently ar-
gued that verbal cues are the most promising indi-
cators for detecting deception (Vrij, 2008) while
lamenting the fact that the majority of previous
research has focused on nonverbal cues. At the
same time, increasing amounts of language are
being digitized and stored on computers and the
Internet ? from email, Twitter and online dating
profiles to legal testimony and corporate commu-
nication. With the recent advances in natural lan-
guage processing that have enhanced our ability
to analyze language, researchers now have an op-
portunity to similarly advance our understanding
of deception.
One of the crucial components of this enter-
prise, as recognized by the call for papers for the
present workshop, is the need to develop corpora
for developing and testing models of deception.
To date there has not been any systematic ap-
proach for corpus creation within the deception
field. In the present study, we first provide an
overview of traditional approaches for this task
(Section 2) and discuss recent deception detec-
tion methods that rely on non-gold standard cor-
pora (Section 3). Section 4 introduces novel ap-
proaches for corpus creation that employ crowd-
sourcing and argues that these have several ad-
vantages over traditional and non-gold standard
approaches. Finally, we describe an in-depth
case study of how these techniques can be im-
plemented to study deceptive online hotel reviews
(Section 5).
2 Traditional Approaches
The deception literature involves a number of
widely used traditional methods for gathering
deceptive and truthful statements. We classify
these according to whether they are sanctioned,
in which the experimenter supplies instructions to
individuals to lie or not lie, or unsanctioned ap-
proaches, in which the participant lies of his or
her own accord.
2.1 Sanctioned Deception
The vast majority of studies examining deception
employ some form of the sanctioned lie method.
A common example is recruiting participants for a
study on deception and randomly assigning them
to a lie or truth condition. A classic example of
this kind of procedure is the original study by Ek-
man and Friesen (1969), in which nurses were
required to watch pleasant or highly disturbing
movie clips. The nurses were instructed to indi-
cate that they were watching a pleasing movie,
which required the nurses watching the disturbing
clips to lie about their current emotional state.
In another example, Newman et. al. (2003) ask
23
participants about their beliefs concerning a given
topic, such as abortion, and then instruct partici-
pants to convince a partner that they hold the op-
posite belief.
Another form of sanctioned deception is to in-
struct participants to engage in some form of
mock crime and then ask them to lie about it. For
example, in one study (Porter and Yuille, 1996),
participants were asked to take an item, such as
a wallet, from a room and then lie about it after-
wards. The mock crime approach improves the
ecological validity of the deception, and makes it
the case that the person actually did in fact act a
certain way that they then must deny.
2.1.1 Advantages and Limitations
The advantages are obvious for these sanc-
tioned lie approaches. The researcher has large
degrees of experimental control over what the par-
ticipant lies about and when, which allows for
careful comparison across the deceptive and non-
deceptive accounts. Another advantage is the rel-
ative ease of instructing participants to lie vs. try-
ing to identify actual (but unknown) lies in a dia-
logue.
The limitations for this approach, however, are
also obvious. In asking participants to lie, the
researcher is essentially giving permission to the
person to lie. This should affect the partici-
pant?s behavior as the lie is being conducted at
the behest of a power figure, essentially acting
out their deception. Indeed, a number of schol-
ars have pointed out this problem (Frank and Ek-
man, 1997), and have suggested that unless high
stakes are employed the paradigm produces data
that does not replicate any typical lying situation.
High stakes refers to the potential for punishment
if the lie is detected or reward if the lie goes unde-
tected. Perhaps because of the difficulty in creat-
ing high-stakes deception scenarios, to date there
are few corpora involving high-stakes lies.
2.2 Unsanctioned Deception
Unsanctioned lies are those that are told without
any explicit instruction or permission from the re-
searcher. These kinds of lies have been collected
in a number of ways.
2.2.1 Diary studies and surveys
Two related methods for collecting information
about unsanctioned lies are diary studies and sur-
vey studies. In diary studies participants are asked
on an ongoing basis (e.g., every night) to recall
lies that they told over a given period (e.g., a day,
a week) (DePaulo et al, 1996; Hancock et al,
2004). Similarly, recent studies have asked par-
ticipants in national surveys how often they have
lied in the last 24 hours (Serota et al, 2010).
One important feature of these approaches is
that the lies have already taken place, and thus
they do not share the same limitations as sanc-
tioned lies. There are several drawbacks, how-
ever, especially given the current goal to collect
deception corpora. First, both diary studies and
survey approaches require self-reported recall of
deception. Several biases are likely to affect the
results, including under-reporting of deception in
order to reduce embarrassment and difficult-to-
remember deceptions that have occurred over the
time period. More importantly, this kind of ap-
proach does not lend itself to collecting the actual
language of the lie, for incorporation into a cor-
pus: people have a poor memory for conversation
recall (Stafford and Sharkey, 1987).
2.2.2 Retrospective Identification
One method for getting around the memory
limitations for natural discourse is to record the
discourse and ask participants to later identify any
deceptions in their discourse. For instance, one
study (Feldman and Happ, 2002) asked partici-
pants to meet another individual and talk for ten
minutes. After the discussion, participants were
asked to examine the videotape of the discussion
and indicated any times in which they were de-
ceptive. More recently, others have used the ret-
rospective identification technique on mediated
communication, such as SMS, which produces
an automatic record of the conversation that can
be reviewed for deception (Hancock, 2009). Be-
cause this approach preserves a record that the
participant can use to identify the deception, this
technique can generate data for linguistic analy-
sis. However, an important limitation, as with the
diary and survey data, is that the researcher must
assume that the participant is being truthful about
their deception reporting.
2.2.3 Cheating Procedures
The last form of unsanctioned lying involves
incentivizing participants to first cheat on a task
and to then lie when asked about the cheating be-
havior. Levine et al (2010) have recently used
24
this approach, which involved students perform-
ing a trivia quiz. During the quiz, an opportunity
to cheat arises where some of the students will
take the opportunity. At this point, they have not
yet lied, but, after the quiz is over, all students
are asked whether they cheated by an interviewer
who does not know if they cheated or not. While
most of the cheaters admit to cheating, a small
fraction of the cheaters deny cheating. This sub-
set of cheating denials represents real deception.
The advantages to this approach are three-
fold: (1) the deception is unsanctioned, (2) it
does not involve self-report, and (3) the decep-
tions have objective ground-truth. Unfortunately,
these kinds of experiments are extremely effort-
intensive given the number of deceptions pro-
duced. Only a tiny fraction of the participants
typically end up cheating and subsequently lying
about the cheating.
2.2.4 Limitations
While these techniques have been useful in
many psychology experiments, in which assess-
ing deception detection has been the priority
rather than corpus creation, they are not very
feasible when considering obtaining corpora for
large-scale settings, e.g., the web. Furthermore,
the techniques are limited in the kinds of con-
texts that can be created. For instance, in many
cases, e.g., deliberate posting of fake online re-
views, subjects can be both highly incentivized
to lie and highly concerned with getting caught.
One could imagine surveying hotel owners as to
whether they have ever posted a fake review?but
it would seem unlikely that any owner would ever
admit to having done so.
3 Non-gold Standard Approaches
Recently, alternative approaches have emerged to
study deception in the absence of gold standard
deceptive data. These approaches can typically
be broken up into three distinct types. In Sec-
tion 3.1, we discuss approaches to deception cor-
pus creation that rely on the manual annotation of
deceptive instances in the data. In Section 3.2, we
discuss approaches that rely on heuristic methods
for deriving approximate, but non-gold standard
deception labels. In Section 3.3, we discuss a re-
cent approach that uses assumptions about the ef-
fects of deception to identify examples of decep-
tion in the data. We will refer to the latter as the
unlabeled approach to deception corpus creation.
3.1 Manual Annotations of Deception
In Section 2.2, we discussed diary and self-report
methods of obtaining gold standard labels of de-
ception. Recently, work studying deceptive (fake)
online reviews has suggested using manual anno-
tations of deception, given by third-party human
judges.
Lim et al (2010) study deceptive product re-
views found on Amazon.com. They develop a
sophisticated software interface for manually la-
beling reviews as deceptive or truthful. The inter-
face allows annotators to view all of each user?s
reviews, ranked according to dimensions poten-
tially of importance to identifying deception, e.g.,
whether the review is duplicated, whether the re-
viewer has authored many reviews in a single day
with identical high or low ratings, etc.
Wu et al (2010a) also study deceptive online
reviews of TripAdvisor hotels, manually labeling
a set of reviews according to ?suspiciousness.?
This manually labeled dataset is then used to val-
idate eight proposed characteristics of deceptive
hotels. The proposed characteristics include fea-
tures based on the number of reviews written, e.g.,
by first-time reviewers, as well as the review rat-
ings, especially as they compare to other ratings
of the same hotel.
Li et al (2011) study deceptive product reviews
found on Epinions.com. Based on user-provided
helpfulness ratings, they first draw a subsample of
reviews such that the majority are considered to
be unhelpful. They then manually label this sub-
sample according to whether or not each review
seems to be fake.
3.1.1 Limitations
Manual annotation of deception is problematic
for a number of reasons. First, many of the same
challenges that face manual annotation efforts in
other domains also applies to annotations of de-
ception. For example, manual annotations can be
expensive to obtain, especially in large-scale set-
tings, e.g., the web.
Most seriously however, is that human abil-
ity to detect deception is notoriously poor (Bond
and DePaulo, 2006). Indeed, recent studies have
confirmed that human agreement and deception
detection performance is often no better than
chance (Ott et al, 2011); this is especially the
25
case when considering the overtrusting nature of
most human judges, a phenomenon referred to in
the psychological deception literature as a truth
bias (Vrij, 2008).
3.2 Heuristically Labeled
Work by Jindal and Liu (2008) studying the char-
acteristics of untruthful (deceptive) Amazon.com
reviews, has instead developed an approach for
heuristically assigning approximate labels of de-
ceptiveness, based on a set of assumptions spe-
cific to their domain. In particular, after re-
moving certain types of irrelevant ?reviews,? e.g.,
questions, advertisements, etc., they determine
whether each review has been duplicated, i.e.,
whether the review?s text heavily overlaps with
the text of other reviews in the same corpus. Then,
they simply label all discovered duplicate reviews
as untruthful.
Heuristic labeling approaches do not produce a
true gold-standard corpus, but for some domains
may offer an acceptable approximation. How-
ever, as with other non-gold standard approaches,
certain behaviors might have other causes, e.g.,
duplication could be accidental, and just because
something is duplicated does not make the origi-
nal (first) post deceptive. Indeed, in cases where
the original review is truthful, its duplication is
not a good example of deceptive reviews written
from scratch.
3.3 Unlabeled
Rather than develop heuristic labeling ap-
proaches, Wu et al (2010b) propose a novel strat-
egy for evaluating hypotheses about deceptive ho-
tel reviews found on TripAdvisor.com, based on
distortions of popularity rankings. Specifically,
they test the Proportion of Positive Singletons and
Concentration of Positive Singletons hypotheses
of Wu et al (2010a) (Section 3.1), but instead of
using manually-derived labels they evaluate their
hypotheses by the corresponding (distortion) ef-
fect they have on the hotel rankings.
Unlabeled approaches rely on assumptions
about the effects of the deception. For example,
the approach utilized by Wu et al (2010b) observ-
ing distortion effects on hotel rankings, relies on
the assumption that the goal of deceivers in the
online hotel review setting is to increase a hotel?s
ranking. And while this may be true for positive
hotel reviews, it is likely to be very untrue for fake
negative reviews intended to defame a competitor.
Indeed, great care must be taken in making such
assumptions in unlabeled approaches to studies of
deception.
4 Crowdsourcing Approaches
As with traditional sanctioned deception ap-
proaches (see Section 2.1), one way of obtain-
ing gold standard labels is to simply create gold
standard deceptive content. Crowdsourcing plat-
forms are a particularly compelling space to pro-
duce such deceptive content: they connect people
who request the completion of small tasks with
workers who will carry out the tasks. Crowd-
sourcing platforms that solicit small copywriting
tasks include Clickworker, Amazon?s Mechanical
Turk, Fiverr, and Worth1000. Craigslist, while not
a crowdsourcing platform, also promotes similar
solicitations for writing. In the case of fake online
reviews (see Section 5), and by leveraging plat-
forms such as Mechanical Turk, we can often gen-
erate gold standard deceptive content in contexts
very similar to those observed in practice.
Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009) were among
the first to use Mechanical Turk to collect decep-
tive and truthful opinions ? personal stances on
issues such as abortion and the death penalty. In
particular, for a given topic, they solicited one
truthful and one deceptive stance from each Me-
chanical Turk participant.
Ott et al (2011) have also used Mechanical
Turk to produce gold standard deceptive content.
In particular, they use Mechanical Turk to gener-
ate a dataset of 400 positive (5-star), gold stan-
dard deceptive hotel reviews. These were com-
bined with 400 (positive) truthful reviews cov-
ering the same set of hotels and used to train a
learning-based classifier that could distinguish de-
ceptive vs. truthful positive reviews at 90% accu-
racy levels. The truthful reviews were mined di-
rectly from a well-known hotel review site. The
Ott et al (2011) approach for collecting the gold
standard deceptive reviews is the subject of the
case study below.
5 Case Study: Crowdsourcing Deceptive
Reviews
To illustrate in more detail how crowdsourcing
techniques can be implemented to create gold
standard data sets for the study of deception, we
26
draw from the Ott et al (2011) approach that
crowdsources the collection of deceptive positive
hotel reviews using Mechanical Turk. The key
assumptions of the approach are as follows:
? We desire a balanced data set, i.e., equal
numbers of truthful and deceptive reviews.
This is so that statistical analyses of the data
set won?t be biased towards either type of re-
view.
? The truthful and deceptive reviews should
cover the same set of entities. If the two
sets of reviews cover different entities (e.g.,
different hotels), then the language that dis-
tinguishes truthful from deceptive reviews
might be attributed to the differing entities
under discussion rather than to the legiti-
macy of the review.
? The resulting data set should be of a rea-
sonable size. Ott et al (2011) found that
a dataset of 800 total reviews (400 truthful,
400 deceptive) was adequate for their goal
of training a learning-based classifier.
? The truthful and deceptive reviews should
exhibit the same valence, i.e., sentiment.
If the truthful reviews gathered from the on-
line site are positive reviews, the deceptive
reviews should be positive as well.
? More generally, the deceptive reviews
should be generated under the same ba-
sic guidelines as governs the generation
of truthful reviews. E.g., they should have
the same length constraints, the same quality
constraints, etc.
Step 1: Identify the set of entities to be cov-
ered in the truthful reviews. In order to de-
fine a set of desirable reviews, a master database,
provided by the review site itself, is mined to
identify the most commented (most popular) en-
tities. These are a good source of truthful re-
views. In particular, previous work has hypoth-
esized that popular offerings are less likely to
be targeted by spam (Jindal and Liu, 2008), and
therefore reviews for those entities are less likely
to be deceptive?enabling those reviews to later
comprise the truthful review corpus. The review
site database typically divides the entity set into
subcategories that differ across contexts: in the
case of hotel reviews the subcategories might re-
fer to cities, or in the case of doctor reviews
subcategories might refer to specialties. To en-
sure that enough reviews of the entity can be col-
lected, it may be important to select subcategories
that themselves are popular. The study of Ott et
al. (2011), for example, focused on reviews of ho-
tels in Chicago, IL, gathering positive (i.e., 5-star)
reviews for the 20 most popular hotels.
Step 2: Develop the crowdsourcing prompt.
Once a set of entities has been identified for the
deceptive reviews (Step 1), the prompt for Me-
chanical Turk is developed. This begins with a
survey of other solicitations for reviews within the
same subcategory through searching Mechanical
Turk, Craigslist, and other online resources. Us-
ing those solicitations as reference, a scenario can
then be developed that will be used in the prompt
to achieve the appropriate (in our case, positive)
valence. The result is a prompt that mimics the
vocabulary and tone that ?Turkers? (i.e., the work-
ers on Mechanical Turk) may find familiar and de-
sirable.
For example, the prompt of Ott et al (2011)
read: Imagine you work for the marketing depart-
ment of a hotel. Your boss asks you to write a fake
review for the hotel (as if you were a customer) to
be posted on a travel review website. The review
needs to sound realistic and portray the hotel in
a positive light. Look at their website if you are
not familiar with the hotel. (A link to the website
was provided.)
Step 3: Attach appropriate warnings to the
crowdsource solicitation. It is important that
warnings are attached to the solicitation to avoid
gathering (and paying for) reviews that would
invalidate the review set for the research. For
example, because each review should be written
by a different person, the warning might disallow
coders from performing multiple reviews; forbid
any form of plagiarism; require that reviews be
?on topic,? coherent, etc. Finally, the prompt
may inform the Turker that this exercise is for
academic purposes only and will not be posted
online, however, if such a notice is presented
before the review is written and submitted, the
resulting lie may be overly sanctioned.
27
Step 4: Incorporate into the solicitation a
means for gathering additional data. Append
to the end of the solicitation some mechanism
(e.g., Mechanical Turk allows for a series of ra-
dio buttons) to input basic information about age,
gender, or education of the coder. This allows for
post-hoc understanding of the demographic of the
participating Turkers. Ott et al (2011) also sup-
ply a space for comments by the workers, with an
added incentive of a potential bonus for particu-
larly helpful comments. Ott et al (2011) found
this last step critical to the iterative process for
providing insights from coders on inconsistencies,
technical difficulties, and other unforeseen prob-
lems that arise in the piloting phase.
Step 5: Gather the deceptive reviews in
batches. The solicitation is then published in a
small pilot test batch. In Ott et al (2011), each pi-
lot requested ten (10) reviews from unique work-
ers. Once the pilot run is complete, the results
are evaluated, with particular attention to the com-
ments, and is then iterated upon in small batches
of 10 until there are no technical complaints and
the results are of desired experiment quality.
Once this quality is achieved, the solicitation is
then published as a full run, generating 400 re-
views by unique workers. The results are man-
ually evaluated and cleaned to ensure all reviews
are valid, then filtered for plagiarism. The result-
ing set of gold standard online deceptive spam is
then used to train the algorithm for deceptive pos-
itive reviews.
5.1 Handling Plagiarism
One of the main challenges facing crowdsourced
deceptive content is identifying plagiarism. For
example, when a worker on Mechanical Turk
is asked to write a deceptive hotel review, that
worker may copy an available review from var-
ious sources on the Internet (e.g., TripAdvisor).
These plagiarized reviews lead to flaws in our
gold standard. Hence there arises a need to detect
such reviews and separate them from the entire
review set.
One way to address this challenge is to do
a manual check of the reviews, one-by-one, us-
ing online plagiarism detection web services, e.g.,
plagiarisma.net or searchenginereports.net. The
manual process is taxing, especially when there
are reviews in large numbers (as large as 400) to
be processed. This illustrates a need to have a
tool which automates the detection of plagiarized
content in Turker submissions. There are several
plagiarism detection softwares which are widely
available in the market. Most of them maintain
a database of content against which to check for
plagiarism. The input content is checked against
these databases and the content is stored in the
same database at the end of the process. Such
tools are an appropriate fit for detecting plagia-
rized content in term papers, course assignments,
journals etc. However, online reviews define a
separate need which checks for plagiarism against
the content available on the web. Hence the avail-
able software offerings are not adequate.
We implemented a command line tool using the
Yahoo! BOSS API, which is used to query sen-
tences on the web. Each of the review files is
parsed to read as individual sentences. Each sen-
tence is passed as a query input to the API. We
introduce the parameters, n and m, defined as:
1. Any sentence which is greater than n words
is considered to be a ?long sentence? in the
application usage. If the sentence is a ?long
sentence? and the Yahoo! BOSS API returns
no result, we query again using the first n
words of the sentence. Here n is a config-
urable parameter, and in our experiments we
configured n = 10.
2. A sentence that is commonly used on the
web can return many matches, even if it was
not plagiarized. Thus, we introduce another
parameter, m, such that if the number of
search results returned by the Yahoo! BOSS
API is greater than m, then the sentence is
considered common and is ignored. Our ob-
servations indicate that such frequently used
sentences are likely to be short. For exam-
ple: ?We are tired,? ?No room,? etc. For our
usage we configured m = 30.
We consider a sentence to be plagiarized if the
total number of results returned by the Yahoo!
BOSS API is less than m. Hence each sentence
is assigned a score as follows:
? If the total number of results is greater than
m: assign a score of 0
? If the total number of results is less than or
equal to m: assign a score of 1
28
We then divide the sum of the sentence scores in a
review by the total number of sentences to obtain
the ratio of the number of matches to total num-
ber of sentences. We use this ratio to determine
whether or not a review was plagiarized.
6 Discussion and Conclusion
We have discussed several techniques for creating
and labeling deceptive content, including tradi-
tional, non-gold standard, and crowdsourced ap-
proaches. We have also given an illustrative in-
depth look at how one might use crowdsourcing
services such as Mechanical Turk to solicit decep-
tive hotel reviews.
While we argue that the crowdsourcing ap-
proach to creating deceptive statements has
tremendous potential, there remain a number of
important limitations, some shared by the pre-
vious traditional methods laid out above. First,
workers are given ?permission? to lie, so these
lies are sanctioned and have the same concerns
as the traditional sanctioned methods, including
the concern that the workers are just play-acting
rather than lying. Other unique limitations in-
clude the current state of knowledge about work-
ers. In a laboratory setting we can fairly tightly
measure and control for gender, race, and even
socioeconomic status, but this is not the case for
the Amazon Turkers, who potentially make up a
much more diverse population.
Despite these issues we believe that the ap-
proach has much to offer. First, and perhaps most
importantly, the deceptions are being solicited in
exactly the manner real-world deceptions are ini-
tiated. This is important in that the deception task,
though sanctioned, is precisely the same task that
a real-world deceiver might use, e.g., to collect
fake hotel reviews for themselves. Second, this
approach is extremely cost effective in terms of
the time and finances required to create custom
deception settings that fit a specific context. Here
we looked at creating fake hotel reviews, but we
can easily apply this approach to other types of
reviews, including reviews of medical profession-
als, restaurants, and products.
