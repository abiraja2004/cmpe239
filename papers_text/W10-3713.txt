Abstract
The Varro toolkit offers an intuitive mech-
anism for extracting syntactically mo-
tivated multi-word expressions (MWEs)
from dependency treebanks by looking for
recurring connected subtrees instead of
subsequences in strings. This approach
can find MWEs that are in varying orders
and have words inserted into their compo-
nents. This paper also proposes descrip-
tion length gain as a statistical correlation
measure well-suited to tree structures.
1 Introduction
Automatic MWE extraction techniques operate
by using either statistical correlation tests on the
distributions of words in corpora, syntactic pat-
tern matching techniques, or by using hypothe-
ses about the semantic non-compositionality of
MWEs. This paper proposes a purely statistical
technique for MWE extraction that incorporates
syntactic considerations by operating entirely on
dependency treebanks. On the whole, dependency
trees have one node for each word in the sentence,
although most dependency schemes vary from this
to some extent in practice. See Figure 1 for an
example dependency tree produced automatically
by the Stanford parser from the English language
data in the Europarl corpus. (Marneffe, 2008;
Koehn, 2005)
Identifying MWEs with subtrees in dependency
trees is not a new idea. It is close to the formal def-
inition offered in Mel?c?uk (1998), and is applied
computationally in Debusmann (2004) However,
using dependency treebanks to automatically ex-
tract MWEs is fairly new and few MWE extrac-

tion projects to date take advantage of dependency
information directly. There are a number of rea-
sons why this is the case:
? String-based algorithms are not readily ap-
plicable to trees.
? Tree structures yield a potentially combina-
torial number of candidate MWEs, a prob-
lem shared with methods that look for strings
with gaps.
? Statistical techniques used in MWE extrac-
tion, like pointwise mutual information, are
two-variable tests that are not easy to apply
to larger sets of words.
The tool and statistical procedures used in this
research are not language dependent and can op-
erate on MWE of any size, producing depen-

dency pairs, short phrases of any syntactic cate-
gory, lengthy formulas and idioms. There are no
underlying linguistic assumptions in this method-
ology except that a MWE must consist of words
that have a fixed set of dependency links in a
treebank. Even word order and distance between
words is not directly assumed to be significant.
The input, however, requires substantial linguis-
tic pre-processing ? particularly, the identification
of at least some of the dependency relations in
the corpora used. Retrieving MWEs that contain
abstract categories, like information about the ar-
guments of verbs or part-of-speech information
for unincluded elements, requires using treebanks
that contain that information, rather than purely
lexical dependency trees.
2 Varro Toolkit for Frequent Subtree
Discovery
The Varro toolkit is an open-source application for
efficiently extracting frequent closed unordered
induced subtrees from treebanks with labeled
nodes and edges. It is publicly available under an
open source license.1 For a fuller description of
Varro, including the algorithm and data structures
used and a formal definition of frequent closed un-
ordered induced subtrees, see Martens (2010).
Given some tree like the one in Figure 1, an in-
duced subtree is a connected subset of its nodes
and the edges that connect them, as shown in
Figure 2. Subtrees do not necessarily represent
1http://varro.sourceforge.net/
fixed sequences of words in the original text,
they include syntactically motivated discontinu-
ous phrases. This dramatically reduces the num-
ber of candidate discontinuous MWEs when com-
pared to string methods. An unordered induced
subtree is a subtree where the words may appear
with different word orders, but the subtree is still
identified as the same if the dependency structure
is the same. A frequent closed subtree is a sub-
tree of a treebank that appears more than some
fixed number of times and where there is no sub-
tree that contains it and appears the same number
of times. Finding only closed subtrees reduces the
combinatorial explosion of possible subtrees, and
ensures that each candidate MWE includes all the
words the that co-occur with it every time it ap-
pears.
3 Preprocessing and Extracting Subtrees
The English language portion of the Europarl
Corpus, version 3 was parsed using the Stanford
parser, which produces both a constituentcy parse
and a dependency tree as its output.2 The depen-
dency information for each sentence was trans-
formed into the XML input format used by Varro.
The result is a treebank of 1.4 million individual
parse trees, each representing a sentence, and a to-
tal of 36 million nodes.
In order to test the suitability of Varro for large
treebanks and intensive extractions, all recurring
closed subtrees that appear at least twice were ex-
tracted. This took a total of 129,312.27 seconds
(just over 34 hours), producing 9,976,355 frequent
subtrees, of which 9,909,269 contain more than
one word and are therefore candidate MWEs.
A fragment of the Varro output can be seen in
Figure 3. The nodes of the subtrees returned are
not in a grammatical surface order. However, the
original source order can be recovered by using
the locations where each subtree appears to find
the order in the treebank. Doing so for the tree
in Figure 3 shows what kinds of MWEs this ap-
proach can extract from treebanks. The under-
lined words in the following sentences are the
ones included in the subtree in Figure 3:

4 Statistical Methods for Evaluating
Subtrees as MWEs
To evaluate the quality of subtrees as MWEs,
we propose to use a simplified form of de-
scription length gain (DLG), a metric derived
from algorithmic information theory and Mini-
mum Description Length methods (MDL). (Ris-
sanen, 1978; Gru?nwald, 2005) Given a quantity of
data of any kind that can be stored as a digital in-
formation in a computer, and some process which
transforms the data in a way that can be reversed,
DLG is the measure of how the space required to
store that data changes when it is transformed.
To calculate DLG, one must first decide how to
encode the trees in the treebank. It is not neces-
sary to actually encode the treebank in any par-
ticular format. All that is necessary is to be able
to calculate how many bits the treebank would re-
quire to encode it.
Space prevents the full description of the en-
coding mechanism used or the way DLG is cal-
culated. The encoding mechanism is largely the
same as the one described in Luccio et al (2001)
Converting the trees to strings makes it possible to
calculate the encoding size by calculating the en-
tropy of the treebank in that encoding using clas-
sical information theoric methods.
In effect, the procedure for calculating DLG is
to calculate the entropy of the whole treebank,
given the encoding method chosen, and then to
recalculate its entropy given some subtree which
is removed from the treebank and replaced with a
symbol that acts as an abbreviation. That subtree
is then be added back to the treebank once as part
of a look-up table. These methods are largely the
same as those used by common data compression
software.
DLG is the difference between these two en-
tropy measures.3
Because of the sensitivity of DLG to low fre-
quencies, it can be viewed as a kind of non-
parametric significance test. Any frequent struc-
ture that cannot be used to compress the treebank
has a negative DLG and is not frequent enough or
large enough to be considered significant.
Varro reports several statistics related to DLG
for each extracted subtree, as shown in Figure 3:
? Unique appearances (reported by the root-
Count attribute) is the number of times the
extracted subtree appears with a different
root node.
? Entropy is the entropy of the extracted sub-
tree, given the encoding scheme that Varro
uses to calculate DLG.
? Algorithmic mutual information (AMI) (re-
ported with the mi attribute) is the DLG of
the extracted subtree divided by its number
of unique appearances in the treebank.
? Compression is the AMI divided by the en-
tropy.
AMI is comparable to pointwise mutual infor-
mation (PMI) in that both are measures of redun-
dant bits, while compression is comparable to nor-
malized mutual information metrics.
3This is a very simplified picture of MDL and DLG met-
rics.

5 Results and Conclusions
We used the metrics described above to sort the
nearly 10 million frequent subtrees of the parsed
English Europarl corpus. We found that:
? Compression and AMI metrics strongly fa-
vor very large subtrees that represent highly
formulaic language.
? DLG alone finds smaller, high frequency ex-
pressions more like MWEs favoured by ter-
minologists and collocation analysis.
For example, the highest DLG subtree matches
the phrase ?the European Union?. This is not
unexpected given the source of the data and con-
stitutes a very positive result. Among the nearly
10 million candidate MWEs extracted, it also
places near the top discontinuous phrases like
?... am speaking ... in my ... capacity as ...?.
Using both compression ratio and AMI, the
same subtree appears first. It is present 26 times
in the treebank, with a compression score of 0.894
and an AMI of 386.92 bits. It corresponds to the
underlined words in the sentence below:
The next item is the recommendation for
second reading (A4-0245/99), on behalf of
the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on
the common position adopted by the Council
(13651/3/98 - C4-0037/99-96/0182 (COD) with
a view to adopting a Council Directive on the
charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of
certain infrastructures.
This is precisely the kind of formulaic speech,
with various gaps to fill in, which is of great inter-
est for sub-sentential translation memory systems.
(Gotti et al, 2005; Vandeghinste and Martens,
2010)
We believe this kind of strategy can substan-
tially enhance MWE extraction techniques. It in-
tegrates syntax into MWE extraction in an intu-
itive way. Furthermore, description length gain
offers a unified statistical account of an MWE as
a linguistically motivated structure that can com-
press relevant corpus data. It is similar to the types
of statistical tests already used, but is also non-
parametric and suitable for the study of arbitrary
MWEs, not just two-word MWEs or phrases that
occur without gaps.
