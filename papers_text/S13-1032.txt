Abstract
This article provides a detailed overview of the
CPN text-to-text similarity system that we par-
ticipated with in the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity task evaluations hosted at *SEM 2013. In
addition to more traditional components, such
as knowledge-based and corpus-based met-
rics leveraged in a machine learning frame-
work, we also use opinion analysis features to
achieve a stronger semantic representation of
textual units. While the evaluation datasets are
not designed to test the similarity of opinions,
as a component of textual similarity, nonethe-
less, our system variations ranked number 38,
39 and 45 among the 88 participating systems.
1 Introduction
Measures of text similarity have been used for a long
time in applications in natural language processing
and related areas. One of the earliest applications
of text similarity is perhaps the vector-space model
used in information retrieval, where the document
most relevant to an input query is determined by
ranking documents in a collection in reversed or-
der of their angular distance with the given query
(Salton and Lesk, 1971). Text similarity has also
been used for relevance feedback and text classifi-
cation (Rocchio, 1971), word sense disambiguation
(Lesk, 1986; Schutze, 1998), and extractive summa-
rization (Salton et al, 1997), in the automatic evalu-
ation of machine translation (Papineni et al, 2002),
?carmen.banea@gmail.com

text summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003), text co-
herence (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005) and in plagia-
rism detection (Nawab et al, 2011).
Earlier work on this task has primarily focused on
simple lexical matching methods, which produce a
similarity score based on the number of lexical units
that occur in both input segments. Improvements
to this simple method have considered stemming,
stopword removal, part-of-speech tagging, longest
subsequence matching, as well as various weight-
ing and normalization factors (Salton and Buckley,
1997). While successful to a certain degree, these
lexical similarity methods cannot always identify the
semantic similarity of texts. For instance, there is an
obvious similarity between the text segments ?she
owns a dog? and ?she has an animal,? yet these
methods will mostly fail to identify it.
More recently, researchers have started to con-
sider the possibility of combining the large number
of word-to-word semantic similarity measures (e.g.,
(Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Leacock and Chodorow,
1998; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995)) within a semantic
similarity method that works for entire texts. The
methods proposed to date in this direction mainly
consist of either bipartite-graph matching strate-
gies that aggregate word-to-word similarity into a
text similarity score (Mihalcea et al, 2006; Islam
and Inkpen, 2009; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011;
Mohler et al, 2011), or data-driven methods that
perform component-wise additions of semantic vec-
tor representations as obtained with corpus mea-
sures such as latent semantic analysis (Landauer et
al., 1997), explicit semantic analysis (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007), or salient semantic analysis
221
(Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011).
In this paper, we describe the system variations
with which we participated in the *SEM 2013 task
on semantic textual similarity (Agirre et al, 2013).
The system builds upon our earlier work on corpus-
based and knowledge-based methods of text seman-
tic similarity (Mihalcea et al, 2006; Hassan and
Mihalcea, 2011; Mohler et al, 2011; Banea et al,
2012), while also incorporating opinion aware fea-
tures. Our observation is that text is not only similar
on a semantic level, but also with respect to opin-
ions. Let us consider the following text segments:
?she owns a dog? and ?I believe she owns a dog.?
The question then becomes how similar these text
fragments truly are. Current systems will consider
the two sentences semantically equivalent, yet to a
human, they are not. A belief is not equivalent to a
fact (and for the case in point, the person may very
well have a cat or some other pet), and this should
consequently lower the relatedness score. For this
reason, we advocate that STS systems should also
consider the opinions expressed and their equiva-
lence. While the *SEM STS task is not formulated
to evaluate this type of similarity, we complement
more traditional corpus and knowledge-based meth-
ods with opinion aware features, and use them in
a meta-learning framework in an arguably first at-
tempt at incorporating this type of information to in-
fer text-to-text similarity.
2 Related Work
Over the past years, the research community has
focused on computing semantic relatedness using
methods that are either knowledge-based or corpus-
based. Knowledge-based methods derive a measure
of relatedness by utilizing lexical resources and on-
tologies such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) to measure
definitional overlap, term distance within a graph-
ical taxonomy, or term depth in the taxonomy as
a measure of specificity. We explore several of
these measures in depth in Section 3.3.1. On the
other side, corpus-based measures such as Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al, 1997),
Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007), Salient Semantic Analysis
(SSA) (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011), Pointwise Mu-
tual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990),
PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), Second Order PMI (Islam
and Inkpen, 2006), Hyperspace Analogues to Lan-
guage (Burgess et al, 1998) and distributional simi-
larity (Lin, 1998) employ probabilistic approaches
to decode the semantics of words. They consist
of unsupervised methods that utilize the contextual
information and patterns observed in raw text to
build semantic profiles of words. Unlike knowledge-
based methods, which suffer from limited coverage,
corpus-based measures are able to induce a similar-
ity between any given two words, as long as they
appear in the very large corpus used as training.
3 Semantic Textual Similarity System
3.1 Task Setup
The STS task consists of labeling one sentence pair
at a time, based on the semantic similarity existent
between its two component sentences. Human as-
signed similarity scores range from 0 (no relation)
to 5 (semantivally equivalent). The *SEM 2013 STS
task did not provide additional labeled data to the
training and testing sets released as part of the STS
task hosted at SEMEVAL 2012 (Agirre et al, 2012);
our system variations were trained on SEMEVAL
2012 data.
The test sets (Agirre et al, 2013) consist of
text pairs extracted from headlines (headlines,
750 pairs), sense definitions from WordNet and
OntoNotes (OnWN, 561 pairs), sense definitions
from WordNet and FrameNet (FNWN, 189 pairs),
and data used in the evaluation of machine transla-
tion systems (SMT, 750 pairs).
3.2 Resources
Various subparts of our framework use several re-
sources that are described in more detail below.
Wikipedia1 is the most comprehensive encyclo-
pedia to date, and it is an open collaborative effort
hosted on-line. Its basic entry is an article which in
addition to describing an entity or an event also con-
tains hyperlinks to other pages within or outside of
Wikipedia. This structure (articles and hyperlinks)
is directly exploited by semantic similarity methods
such as ESA (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007),
or SSA (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011)2.

2In the experiments reported in this paper, all the corpus-
based methods are trained on the English Wikipedia download
from October 2008.
222
WordNet (Miller, 1995) is a manually crafted lex-
ical resource that maintains semantic relationships
such as synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, etc., be-
tween basic units of meaning, or synsets. These rela-
tionships are employed by various knowledge-based
methods to derive semantic similarity.
The MPQA corpus (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) is
a newswire data set that was manually annotated
at the expression level for opinion-related content.
Some of the features derived by our opinion extrac-
tion models were based on training on this corpus.
3.3 Features
Our system variations derive the similarity score of a
given sentence-pair by integrating information from
knowledge, corpus, and opinion-based sources3.
3.3.1 Knowledge-Based Features
Following prior work from our group (Mihalcea
et al, 2006; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009), we em-
ploy several WordNet-based similarity metrics for
the task of sentence-level similarity. Briefly, for each
open-class word in one of the input texts, we com-
pute the maximum semantic similarity4 that can be
obtained by pairing it with any open-class word in
the other input text. All the word-to-word similarity
scores obtained in this way are summed and normal-
ized to the length of the two input texts. We provide
below a short description for each of the similarity
metrics employed by this system.
The shortest path (Path) similarity is equal to:
Simpath =
1
length
(1)
where length is the length of the shortest path be-
tween two concepts using node-counting.
The Leacock & Chodorow (Leacock and
Chodorow, 1998) (LCH) metric is equal to:
Simlch = ? log
length
2 ?D
(2)
where length is the length of the shortest path be-
tween two concepts using node-counting, and D is
the maximum depth of the taxonomy.
The Lesk (Lesk) similarity of two concepts is de-
fined as a function of the overlap between the cor-
responding definitions, as provided by a dictionary.
3The abbreviation in italics accompanying each method al-
lows for cross-referencing with the results listed in Table 2.
4We use the WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al,
2004).
It is based on an algorithm proposed by Lesk (1986)
as a solution for word sense disambiguation.
The Wu & Palmer (Wu and Palmer, 1994) (WUP )
similarity metric measures the depth of two given
concepts in the WordNet taxonomy, and the depth
of the least common subsumer (LCS), and combines
these figures into a similarity score:
Simwup =
2 ? depth(LCS)
depth(concept1) + depth(concept2)
(3)
The measure introduced by Resnik (Resnik, 1995)
(RES) returns the information content (IC) of the
LCS of two concepts:
Simres = IC(LCS) (4)
where IC is defined as:
IC(c) = ? logP (c) (5)
and P (c) is the probability of encountering an in-
stance of concept c in a large corpus.
The measure introduced by Lin (Lin, 1998) (Lin)
builds on Resnik?s measure of similarity, and adds
a normalization factor consisting of the information
content of the two input concepts:
Simlin =
2 ? IC(LCS)
IC(concept1) + IC(concept2)
(6)
We also consider the Jiang & Conrath (Jiang and
Conrath, 1997) (JCN ) measure of similarity:
Simjnc =
1
IC(concept1) + IC(concept2)? 2 ? IC(LCS)
(7)
3.3.2 Corpus Based Features
While most of the corpus-based methods induce
semantic profiles in a word-space, where the seman-
tic profile of a word is expressed in terms of its co-
occurrence with other words, LSA, ESA and SSA
rely on a concept-space representation, thus express-
ing a word?s semantic profile in terms of the im-
plicit (LSA), explicit (ESA), or salient (SSA) con-
cepts. This departure from the sparse word-space to
a denser, richer, and unambiguous concept-space re-
solves one of the fundamental problems in semantic
relatedness, namely the vocabulary mismatch.
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al,
1997). In LSA, term-context associations are cap-
tured by means of a dimensionality reduction op-
erated by a singular value decomposition (SVD)
223
on the term-by-context matrix T, where the ma-
trix is induced from a large corpus. This reduc-
tion entails the abstraction of meaning by collaps-
ing similar contexts and discounting noisy and ir-
relevant ones, hence transforming the real world
term-context space into a word-latent-concept space
which achieves a much deeper and concrete seman-
tic representation of words5.
Random Projection (RP ) (Dasgupta, 1999). In RP,
a high dimensional space is projected onto a lower
dimensional one, using a randomly generated ma-
trix. (Bingham and Mannila, 2001) show that unlike
LSA or principal component analysis (PCA), RP
is computationally efficient for large corpora, while
also retaining accurate vector similarity and yielding
comparable results.
Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007). ESA uses encyclopedic
knowledge in an information retrieval framework to
generate a semantic interpretation of words. It relies
on the distribution of words inside Wikipedia arti-
cles, thus building a semantic representation for a
given word using a word-document association.
Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) (Hassan and Mi-
halcea, 2011). SSA incorporates a similar seman-
tic abstraction as ESA, yet it uses salient con-
cepts gathered from encyclopedic knowledge, where
a ?concept? represents an unambiguous expression
which affords an encyclopedic definition. Saliency
in this case is determined based on the word being
hyperlinked in context, implying that it is highly rel-
evant to the given text.
In order to determine the similarity of two text
fragments, we employ two variations: the typical
cosine similarity (cos) and a best alignment strat-
egy (align), which we explain in more detail in
the paragraph below. Both variations were paired
with the ESA, and SSA systems resulting in four
similarity scores that were used as features by our
meta-system, namely ESAcos, ESAalign, SSAcos,
and SSAalign; in addition, we also used BOWcos,
LSAcos, and RPcos.

removing all stopwords, we first determine the num-

ber of shared terms (?) between Ta and Tb. Second,
we calculate the semantic relatedness of all possible
pairings between non-shared terms in Ta and Tb. We
further filter these possible combinations by creating
a list ? which holds the strongest semantic pairings
between the fragments? terms, such that each term
can only belong to one and only one pair.
Sim(Ta, Tb) =

?|?|
i=1 ?i)? (2ab)
a+ b
(8)
where ?i is the similarity score for the ith pairing.
3.3.3 Opinion Aware Features
We design opinion-aware features to capture sen-
tence similarity on the subjectivity level based on the
output of three subjectivity analysis systems. Intu-
itively, two sentences are similar in terms of sub-
jectivity if there exists similar opinion expressions
which also share similar opinion holders.
OpinionFinder (Wilson et al, 2005) is a publicly
available opinion extraction model that annotates the
subjectivity of new text based on the presence (or
absence) of words or phrases in a large lexicon. The
system consists of a two step process, by feeding
the sentences identified as subjective or objective
by a rule-based high-precision classifier to a high-
recall classifier that iteratively learns from the re-
maining corpus. For each sentence in a STS pair,
the two classifiers provide two predictions; a subjec-
tivity similarity score (SUBJSL) is computed as fol-
lows. If both sentences are classified as subjective
or objective, the score is 1; if one is subjective and
the other one is objective, the score is -1; otherwise
it is 0. We also make use of the output of the sub-
jective expression identifier in OpinionFinder. We
first record how many expressions the two sentences
have: feature NUMEX1 and NUMEX2. Then we
compare how many tokens these expressions share
and we normalize by the total number of expressions
(feature EXPR).
We compute the difference between the probabil-
ities of the two sentences being subjective (SUBJD-
IFF), by employing a logistic regression classifier
using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al, 2008) trained on the
MPQA corpus. The smaller the difference, the more
similar the sentences are in terms of subjectivity.
We also employ features produced by the opinion-
extraction model of Yang and Cardie (Yang and
Cardie, 2012), which is better suited to process ex-
224
pressions of arbitrary length. Specifically, for each
sentence, we extract subjective expressions and gen-
erate the following features. SUBJCNT is a binary
feature which is equal to 1 if both sentences con-
tain a subjective expression. DSEALGN marks the
number of shared words between subjective expres-
sions in two sentences, while DSESIM represents
their similarity beyond the word level. We repre-
sent the subjective expressions in each sentence as
a feature vector, containing unigrams extracted from
the expressions, their part-of-speech, their WordNet
hypernyms and their subjectivity label6, and com-
pute the cosine similarity between the feature vec-
tors. The holder of the opinion expressions is ex-
tracted with the aid of a dependency parser7. In most
cases, the opinion holder and the opinion expression
are related by the dependency relation subj. This re-
lation is used to expand the verb dependents in the
opinion expression and identify the opinion holder
or AGENT.
3.4 Meta-learning
Each metric described above provides one individ-
ual score for every sentence-pair in both the train-
ing and test set. These scores then serve as in-
put to a meta-learner, which adjusts their impor-
tance, and thus their bearing on the overall similar-
ity score predicted by the system. We experimented
with regression and decision tree based algorithms
by performing 10-fold cross validation on the 2012
training data; these types of learners are particularly
well suited to maintain the ordinality of the seman-
tic similarity scores (i.e. a score of 4.5 is closer
to either 4 or 5, implying that the two sentences
are mostly or fully equivalent, while also being far
further away from 0, implying no semantic relat-
edness between the two sentences). We obtained
consistent results when using support vector regres-
sion with polynomial kernel (Drucker et al, 1997;
Smola and Schoelkopf, 1998) (SV R) and random
subspace meta-classification with tree learners (Ho,
1998) (RandSubspace)8.
We submitted three system variations based
on the training corpus (first word in the sys-

formed on the merged version of the entire 2012 SE-

and SMT test data were based on training on
matching OnWN and SMT 9 data from 2012, pre-
dictions for the other test sets were computed using
the combined version (comb).
4 Results and Discussion
Table 2 lists the correlations obtained between
the scores assigned by each one of the features
we used and the scores assigned by the human
judges. It is interesting to note that overall, corpus-
based measures are stronger performers compared to
knowledge-based measures. The top contenders in
the former group are ESAalign, SSAalign, LSAcos,
and RPcos, indicating that these methods are able to
leverage a significant amount of semantic informa-
tion from text. While LSAcos achieves high corre-
lations on many of the datasets, replacing the singu-
lar value decomposition operation by random pro-
jection to a lower-dimension space (RP ) achieves
competitive results while also being computation-
ally efficient. This observation is in line with prior
literature (Bingham and Mannila, 2001). Among
the knowledge-based methods, JCN and Path
achieve high performance on more than five of the
datasets. In some cases, particularly on the 2013
test data, the shortest path method (Path) peforms
better or on par with the performance attained by
other knowledge-based measures, despite its com-
putational simplicity. While opinion-based mea-
sures do not exhibit the same high correlation, we
should remember that none of the datasets displays
consistent opinion content, nor were they anno-
tated with this aspect in mind, in order for this in-
formation to be properly leveraged and evaluated.

Nonetheless, we notice several promising features,
such as DSEALIGN and EXPR. Lower cor-
relations seem to be associated with shorter spans
of text, since when averaging all opinion-based cor-
relations per dataset, MSRvid (x2), OnWN (x2),
and headlines display the lowest average correla-
tion, ranging from 0 to 0.03. This matches the
expectation that opinionated content can be easier
identified in longer contexts, as additional subjective
elements amount to a stronger prediction. The other
seven datasets consist of longer spans of text; they
display an average opinion-based correlation be-
tween 0.07 and 0.12, with the exception of FNWN
and SMTnews at 0.04 and 0.01, respectively.
Our systems performed well, ranking 38, 39 and
45 among the 88 competing systems in *SEM 2013
(see Table 1), with the best being comb.SVR and
comb.RandSubspace, both with a mean correlation
of 0.494. We noticed from our participation in
SEMEVAL 2012 (Banea et al, 2012), that training
and testing on the same type of data achieves the
best results; this receives further support when con-
sidering the performance of the indv.RandSubspace
variation on the OnWN data10, which exhibits a

tem (comb.RandSubspace). While we do surpass the
bag-of-words cosine baseline (baseline-tokencos)
computed by the task organizers by a 0.13 differ-
ence in correlation, we fall short by 0.124 from the
performance of the best system in the STS task.
5 Conclusions
To participate in the STS *SEM 2013 task, we con-
structed a meta-learner framework that combines
traditional knowledge and corpus-based methods,
while also introducing novel opinion analysis based
metrics. While the *SEM data is not particularly
suited for evaluating the performance of opinion fea-
tures, this is nonetheless a first step toward conduct-
ing text similarity research while also considering
the subjective dimension of text. Our system varia-
tions ranked 38, 39 and 45 among the 88 participat-
ing systems.
