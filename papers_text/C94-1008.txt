free phrase order (Schi;ufelc 1991). A difli-

Depending on the context,, different word 
orders are eii, her required or, at the very lcasi,, 
they are more natural l,han others. Although 
in 3 and 4 the context is represented by ques- 
t;ions, it is not normally limited to I;hese. 3a, 
which is i;he most natural answer to 3, is very 
unnatural, if not ungrammatical, in 4. Al- 
though not all contexts restrict the order of 
consti/;uents as drastically as 3 and 4, it is a 
general rule for German an<l similar languages 
that sentences are more natural if they are 
properly embedded in their contexts:

It is generally acknowledged thai; the com- 
bination <>f several factors determines the or- 
der of eonstituenl, s in German and similar lan- 
guages, in Steinberger (1994)~ eleven princi- 
ples acting on the pragmatic, semantic and 
syntactic levels are listed, each of which can 
be reformulated as one or several inear prece- 
dence (LP) rules. The :factors comprise of 
t:he tendencies to order ele.ments according to 
the theme-rheme st,ructure and/or I,d the fimc- 
tional sentence perspective. Furthermore, t;hcy 
concern verb ben<ling, animacy, heaviness, the 
importarl<:e of semantic roles for phrase order- 
ing, and others. A disl;inct feature of the order- 
ing r<.'gularil, ies is that none of l, he feel,ors can 
be formulated as an absolute l,P rule, which 
makes word order description dimcull; to deal 
with in NI,P. In receni; years several proposi- 
tions were made to deal with this phenomenon 
in either analysis or general, ion, or both. 
3 Recent  Suggest ions  on 
Treat ing Free Phrase  
Order 
Uszkoreit (1,087) suggests overcoming t;lle lack 
of absohg;e, rules by using disjuncl, iorts of I,P 
rules. The idea is that if at least one IA ~ 
rule sanctions a sequence of constituenl;s, the 
sentence is grammatical. The mode\[ thus ex- 
presses competence, ral;her than performance, 
as it either accepl.s or rejects a senl, ence, with- 
out maldng a judgement on accel%ability dif- 
ferences as in 1. 
Anothe.r idea put forward by \]);rbach 
(1993) accoum;s h)r grades of acceptability. Er- 
bach assume, s thai; the order of verb comple- 
ments ideally is according to an obliqueness 
hierarchy, and thai; each deviation from this o f  
der decreases the acceptability of t.he sentence 
I:)y a factor of 0.8. 'l'wo divergences result in 
an a(:(:el)tabilii,y s(:orc of 0.64 (0.8 * 0.8), e(;c. 
Problems we see linked to this approach are 
I, he use of l;hc obliqueness hierarchy, which lim- 
its l, he preference mechanism to complements, 
and the fact, that every diw~'rsion decreases the 
score invariably, without considering the vary- 
ing effec(; of differen(, wn'iaI, ions. 
A proposal which (;akes into account the 
different importance, or weight, of preference 
rules, is presenl;cd in .lacobs (71988). Jacobs 
assigns each of his preference rules a specific 
numerical weight. If a rule applies in a giwm 
sentence, its value is added to the acceptability 
score of the sentCfl(X',, if it i's violated, its value 
is subtracted. The higher the final score, I;he 
more nal, ural, or the ~bettev' tim senl, ence is.

Some of thorn concern the ordoring of (xm- 
ers (AbtSmmgspar(,ilwln; Thurma:r 1989) and 
other modifier subgroups (Stcinl:)ergc,r \]99,t). 
Some o:f (;ho criticism could be overcome 
by changing l;I'le different propositions lightly.

Table 1: ~Themat iea l ly - tagged'  Canonica l  Form for German 
Before showing some example sentences 
generated by ~his CF~ we have to mention 
one particularity of German, which is that the 
verb is in second position in declarative ma- 
trix clauses (verb-second, or V2 position), and 
in final position in subordinate clauses (verb- 
final, or VI e position). Nearly any element can 
take the one position preceding the verb in V'2, 
,-ailed the. Vo~J'd~t ("p,'e-(verbal)field'). Nor- 
mally a thematic element is placed into the 
Vorfeld. According to IIoberg's (1.981) analy- 
sis of the Mannhe imer  l)'uden Korpus, in 63% 
of al\[ V2 sentences the nominative complement 
(sub jet6) takes this place. A convenient way of 
seeing it is that all elements fol|ow the. verb in 
V2 position according to tile CF, and that one 
(thematic) element is moved int;o the Vorfeld 
position. We suggest hat if the analysis of the 
source language fails to recognise the theme of 
the sentence, the subject takes this place. 
In our model, most elements can cith(,r I)e 
thematic, rhematic, or neutral (i.e. unnmrked 
with respect to theme and theme). Sent(?nce 
variations as different as shown in the exam- 
ples 5a to 5d can be generated using tim canon- 
ical form presented above, depending on t;he 
parameterisation f the features theme, rheme 
and focus for the different constituents. The 
order of elements in 5a corresponds to the de- 
faull, order. Itowever, the same order would be 
general;ed if the personal pronoun was marked 
as being thematic, and/or if the adverb gest.ern 
was rhematic. We put the information -t-theme 
in 5a to 5e in brackets to indicate that this 
feaLm'e is not a requirement to generate I,he 
respect;ire word orders. The relaJ;ive order el' 
the adverb and the accusative NP in 51) dif- 
hn's fi'om the one in 5a, becaus(" I, he object den 
Mann is rhematic. In 5c and 5(I, 9estcr'n and 
den Mam~ arc thematic, respectively, in ad-- 
dition t;o this, the persorm.l pronoun in 5(l is 
marked as being stressed contrastiw'.ly. We 
used eapii;al letters 1,o express the obligatory 
h~cus, ll; is easy to think of more phrase order' 
combinations caused by further parameterisa- 
lions.

Modi tiers shou l<l 1)e classified according to 
ltoberg's (71981) d4 modifier position classes,

modifier indexes are l;he r(.'sult of the stal;istical 
veril~cai,ion of lintel s intuitive classes (1970). 
As modifiers do not alw~ys follow in l, he same 
order, ltoberg chose a classl fication which lead 
to least deviations between her cla.ssiflcation 
72 
and i;he order in the corpus used (Mannheimer 
Duden Korpus). The following sentet~ces ex- 
emplify the order of Lhe CI ~ for modifiers:

ments from 1)eing rho.m~tie. In Germ~m, 1;hese 
inhere.rH, ly nou-rhemi~t,ic eleme.rM;s include per- 
sonM pronouns, as we'll as a limited set of 
too(lifters such as 'wohl in 12. Although some 
modifier groups tend to be potential  rhcmes,

r\]lem&tic elemenLs occur seml;e~n(:e-ihmlly, it, is 
Z3 
likely that either the verb in V2 position, or 
the Vorfeld element, carry heavy stress (12a vs. 
12b).

Haji(:ov~ et el. (1993) suggest hat verbs 
are generally marked as rhemes, except if they 
have very general exical meaning (su(:h as be, 
have, happen, carT'y oul, become). As our main 
concern is word order, and German verb pie{:(> 
ment is restricted by rules which do not al- 
low variation, our algorithm does not allow 
the recognition of verbs as rhemes. In 12, no 
constituent wou\[d be recognised as being the- 
matic. 
Not all languages express theme, rheme 
and focus as distinctly by word order vari- 
ation as German does. Either they rely on 
1;he context to find out which constituents 
(have to) carry stress, or they use other \]Tleans 
such as clefting, pseudo-clefting, topicatisa- 
tion, dislocat;ion, voice, impersonal construc- 
{.ions, partMes, and morphological as well as 
lexical means (Foley/Van Valin 1988). How- 
ever, even in English, which is often r(.'h;rr(,(l 
to as a, fixed wor(\[ order language, irlforma{,io,i 
on theme an{l rheme can be extracted auto- 
matically (Hajiaov? el;. al. \]993; .qt(;i,~l)('rg{.'r 
1992a). To which (tegr{'c this information is 
conveyed in other languages, and 1\]y which 
means, must be subject to a language pair- 
specific investigation. The extraction of infor- 
mation on theme, rheme an(t focus is more im- 
portant when translating from one \[rce phrase 
order la.nguage int, o another, than when trans- 
lating into a fixed-word order language. }low- 
ever, there are independent reasons for recog- 
nislng the sentence focus, namely the. correb> 
{ion between stress on the one hand, and scope 
of negation (Payne 1985) and of degree modi- 
tiers (Steinberger 1992\[)) on the other. 
7 Ambigu i ty  Reso lut ion  
Findings on natural, less natural an(1 ungram- 
matical word order w~riations can also be used 
to iruprove sentence analysis with respect go 
some cases of ambiguity resolution. In the 
case of Tl3, chef' can l)e recognised as denoting 
earlier (e.her2(;), as the homonymous adverb 
(ehers, "ra~her") must not \[)e negated. Fur- 
flmrmore., some cases of unlikely PP attach- 
ment can he nearly excluded. In ld, the I}P 
expressing local;ion (vor der \]lank) is unlikely 
to be a sentence modifier, as this would result 
in (:on{restive focussing of the personal pro- 
noun ihn. This can be seen in 15, where the 
PP car\]not 1)e an ad,iunct l,o the preceding NP, 
b(,(:mlse the Nil ) is realised as a pronoun. The 
PP in 14 is thus more likely to be an adjunct o 
{,he nomi n al;i ve N P (ler M ann (TI 4 a) t h an a sen- 
ten(:e modifier (1,tb). The genera.l principle is 
that focussing constru(;t;ions a.re relatively un- 
lil(ely to occur ill written text, and therefore 
one should avoid the an~dysis involving focus 
when another analysis is possible. This is the 
case when the analysis of the PP as an adjunct 
results in a sentence without toni, restive stress.

8 Conclusion 
The order of constituents in free phrase or- 
der languages is det, crmined by a set of :fac- 
tors which const, itute tendencies rather than 
clear-cut rules. The fact; thi~t most;, hut not all, 
constituent orders are possible, an(1 that some 
74 
orders are more n,~tura\[ than others poses a 
considerable problem for NI,P. 
In this paper,  we presented a method t,o 
deal with these problems from the analysis and 
l;he generation point of view. Concerning anal- 
ysis, the znMn idc~ is (.hat single sentences re- 
flect the theme-rheme structure irnpos(,d l)y 
the context,  so that  thematic ,  rhcmat ic  and 
(contrastivcly) focussed const i tuents can often 
I)e recognised, in generation, wc can convey 
gills knowledge, by diN'.ring word order depend- 
ing on the context. This is achieved by using a 
c~monical form which includes l;he flea:ible cal,- 
cgories l heine, theme and conZraslive focus. 
A major  a(twmtage ()vet: methods sug- 
gested in the past is that  ~cceptz~bilit, y differ- 
ences between sentences can be dealt with, and 
thai: even modifier sequences, which are tra- 
ditionally left ou(; in word order descripLion, 
can be handled. Wrong const,il;uent; or(lets are 
avoided, because the order of t,h<' major part; 
of the sentence is fi?ed, and only sir@c' con- 
st i tuents move to the theme and theme posi- 
tions. 'Fhc difficulty arising from the unclear 
l)orderline between free and fixed phrase or- 
der, which is typical of most free phrase order 
htngua.qes, is dealt with successfully.
