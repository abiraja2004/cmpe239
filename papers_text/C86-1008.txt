ABSTRACT 
In this paper a two level dialogue representation 
system is presented? It is intended to recognize 
the  s t ruc ture  of a large range of d ia logues  
including some nonverbal communicative acts which 
may be involved in an interaction. It provides a 
syntactic description of a dialogue which can be 
expressed  in terms of re -wr i t ing  rules.  The 
semantic level of the proposed representation system 
is g iven  by  the goa l  and subgoa l  s t ruc ture  
underlying the dialogue syntactic units. Two types 
of goal are identified; goals which relate to the 
content of the dialogue, and those which relate to 
cormaunicating the content? 
i. INTRODUCTION 
Research on computational modelling of discourse has 
highlighted some important aspects of hun~an dialogic 
communication. In some cases (Reichman, 1984), a 
structural description of linguistic communication 
has been attempted altklough not for proper dialogue. 
What is requ i red  is a s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ion  
identifying a corresponding set of con~nunicative 
acts which can be confined in a fixed pattern, to 
form higher level communication act categories or 
dialogue constituents. 
The importance of such a structural description, if 
a t ta ined,  is that  it wou ld  make poss ib le  an 
axiomatic theory of dialogue, embedding rhetorical 
patterns, focusing, and focus shifting. 
A possible basis for such a structural description 
is Burton's (1981) taxonomy of communication acts, 
with some modifications. 
Such a formalization of dialogue, however, is a 
fully syntactic one which needs to be augmented with 
some semantics. Our assumption is that dialogue 
constituents have a semantic interpretation in terms 
of goals and subgoals. 
A theoretical frame for a dialogue classification 
system based on these assunptions is being developed 
with the aim of providing a coherent basis for the 
computational modelling of dialogue. 
The final aim of our project is, in fact the design 
and implementation of a computat iona l  d ia log ic  
interaction system, with the ability to recover fr~n 
communication failure. 
2. STRUCZURAL DESCRIPTION 
The syntactic level of a dialogue description system 
has to meet three requirements: 
(a) It must consist of a model whose genera l i ty  
makes it applicable to both person-person and

progranme of the CEC under contract AIP P527. 
person-machine dialogues, irrespective of the 
soc io - ins t i tu t iona l  d i spos i t ion  of any  
speaker/user. 
(b) It must be capable of describing in terms of 
communication concepts the i~teractive nature of 
dialogue exchanges. 
(c) It must be capable of "naming" the units which 
compose  the  d ia logue  exchanges ,  i .eo  
identifying an utterance as both of a particular 
type and playing a cez%ain role in a part icular 
exchange. 
The dialogue units taxonomy proposed  by Bur ton  
(\].981) seems to sat i s fy  these requ i rements .  
According to her analysis systen\[ we distinguish four 
h ierarchica l ly  related levels: the interaction~ 
which is the largest unit; the transaction; the 
exchange; the move; and the act. An interaction 
consists of a number of transactions, a transaction 
consists of a number of exchanges, and so on. ~e  
smallest interactive unit in this system is the 
move. A move can consist of a number of linguistic 
and non-linguistic "acts" which are realised either 
as utterances or physical actions. 
2.1 ACTS 
An act is a way of c lassi fying utterances which 
occur in a conversational move. The act is a level 
above that of the utterance, and a move can consist 
of a number of acts. For example, ~le following is 
an opening n~veby  a teacher in a classroom dialogue 
consisting of two acts (in brackets): 
T: those letters have a special name (Starter) 
do you know what it is (Elicitation) 
Most acts are real isedby a wide range of utterance 
types? For example, the act called 'starter' can be 
real ised by either a statement, question, conraand, 
or a moodless item. 
we d is t ingu ish  the fo l low ing  15 acts, marker, 
summons, silent stress, starter, metastatements, 
conclusion, informative, elicitation, directive, 
comment, accept, reply, react, acknowledge, preface, 
prompt, null. Their definition is always given in 
terms of both l inguistic structure and function. 
Thus, for instance, the starter act, whose structure 
has been described above, has the funct ion  of 
providing information about, directing attention to, 
or thought towards an area, in order to increase the 
l i ke l ihood  of making a correct response to the 
subsequent initiation. An informative act has the 
structure of a statea~nt and serves the function of 
providing information. Some of these acts are more 
directly relevant to the problem of analysing person 
machine dialogues than others. However, together 
they provide a broad fran~work, incorporating both 
verbal and non-verbal aspects of dialogue, within 
which we can situate a detailed analysis of the more 
relevant acts.

2.2 MOVES 
At a h igher  leve l  seven  types  of move are  
recogn ized :  de l ineat ing ,  sketch ing ,  opening, 
supporting, challenging, bound-opening, and re-  
opening. 
Moves are the basic units of a dyadic exchange and 
can consist of a ntnnber of acts. We will define the 
var ious  moves  in a semi - fo rmal  manner .  'fhe 
formal ism is a type of context-sensitive grammar. 
If an element is enclosed in { \] it indicates that 
the item is optional. The symbol I indicates that 
the elements it separates are alternatives. If an 
element is enclosed in < > it indicates that the 
symbol  is non- termina l  and requ i res  fu r ther  
expansion. The following is the formal description 
of a sketching move: 
<sketching move> 
<signal> 
<pre-head> 
<head> 
:= \[<signal>\] {<pre-head>\] <head> 
:=marker I su~nons 
:= starter 
:= metastatement I conclusion 
Similar descriptions are also given for the other 
moves. 
In addition to these standard conventions we adopt a 
special convention to i l lustrate the effects of 
context. ~ is  takes the form: 
C\[<argl> <~g2>\]  := expansion 
Where C is a function which, when evaluated, expands 
<arg2> subject to something being true of <argl>. 
For example, we might want to restrict the expansion 
of <arg2> ~ only those situation in which <argl> 
has already occurred as an act in the previous move. 
This can be accomplished by an appropriately defined 
C function? 
2.3 EXCHANGES 
Sequences of moves compose an exchange. According 
to Burton two types of exchange are distinguished: 
expl icit  boundary (EB) exchanges and conversational 
(C) exchanges. Explicit boundary exchanges occur, 
as the i r  name suggests ,  at the boundary  of 
transactions. They can include del ineating and/or 
sketching moves which must be supported by another 
speaker. 
Conversat iona l  exchanges  consist  of chains of 
opening, challenging and/or supporting moves. EB 
exchanges have the following structure: 
<EB-exchange> := {<delineating move>} 
{<sketching move>} 
<supporting move> 
ffhe structure of a C-exchange is as follows: 
<C-exchange> := <initiation> 
\[<supporting move> 
{<bound-opening move> 
<supporting move> 
{<supporting move>}l\]m\] n\] 
<initiation> := <openingmove>l<challenging move>l 
<re-opening> 
The superscr ip ts  i, m, and n represent sets of 
numbers of repetitions ~ Where \[" contains m numbers, 
m contains n numbers v and n ~onsists o~ just one 
~umber. Th~ numbers ,  the - repet i t ion  factors  
themselves, can range from 0 upwards. However, when 
n is 0, m and 1 are also 0. This arr~\]gement allows 
~s to ge-nerat~ a different bound-opening/supporting 
pattern for each m. 
2.4 TRANSACTIONS AND INTERACTIONS 
Transactions and interactions are the final two 
leve ls  o f  the  c lass i f i ca t ion  h ie rarchy .  
Transactions consist of patterns of exchanges, and 
in teract ions  cons is t  of unordered  str ings of 
transactions. Transactions have the following form: 
<transaction> := {<EB-exchange>} 
C\[<opening n~)ve> <C-exchange>\] 
{C\[<challenging move> <C-exchange>\] 
{C\[<re-openingmove> <C-exchange>\]}l} m 
The C funct ion  in this case expands its second 
argument if the first argument, a move,  is the 
initiator of the C-exchange. 
Finally interactions t~ke the form: 
<interaction> := <transaction> 1 
3. %~E COMV~\]NICATIVE COMPONENT 
The fol lowing two assumptions form the basis for a 
pair ing of a dialogue p lann ing  mechan ism wi th  
elexents of the clialogue description system: 
dialogue participants always have two cooperating 
types of goals, substantive real life goals (S- 
goals),  wh ich  determine  "what to say", and 
l inguist ic/communicative goals (C-goals), which 
determine "how to say it". No re la t ion  of 
necessity seems to hold between them. In fact, in 
most cases there are many d i f fe rent  ways of 
expressing the same goal. 
it is possible to identify hierarchical relations 
between goals and subgoals both for substantive 
and communicative goals. However, in the h igh  
level dialogue description system units S-goals 
see/~1 to be more important, while at the low levels 
C-goal seem to prevail. 
The highest level of the discourse structure is the 
transaction. Given that the dialogue as a whole is a 
means of effecting the high-level goals of one or 
o ther  of the participants, we can functionally 
define transaction as the unit of dialogue concerned 
with effecting these high-level goals. 
At  the h ighest  lewi.~l of the d ia logue 's  goa l  
s t ruc ture  the dominant  goals  mot ivat ing  the 
transaction are those concerned with the substance 
of  the  d ia logue,  not  the means  by wh ich  the 
substance is conveyed.  As we move down this 
hierarchy it is possible to discern a bifurcation of 
goals into one group concerned with the substance of 
the  d ia logue ,  and  the other  concerned  w i th  
communication of this substance. These are the S- 
goa ls  and C-goa ls  (or more  proper ly ,  S and C 
subgoals) mentioned above. 
43 
A transaction is always motivatedby a general goal 
such as seek information, make a t ra in  journey  
(Al len, 1982),  make a reservation. The social 
context, for example the relation between speaker 
and hearer  or s imply  a social  convention, can 
suggest rhetorical choices. Among these might be 
the direct stating of the general goal, the indirect 
revelation o f the  general goal by several related 
questions, the questioning of a system's general 
capabilities before asking, and so on. 
Essent ia l ly,  exchanges can be thought of as the 
topic-bearing elements of the dialogue. New topics 
are introduced by either an EB-exchange (explicit 
boundary), a C-exchange (conversational) with an 
opening move as its first move, or a C-exchange with 
a challenge as its first move. Topics that have 
been discussed prior to the most recent challenge 
are re-introducedby a C-exchange with a re-opening 
move as its f i rst  move. Topics that have been 
discussed less recently are re- introduced by means 
of an EB-exchange containing a sketching move. 
There is, therefore, a strong connection between the 
exchange s t ructure  of the transaction and the 
pattern of topic-shifts in the dialogue. These 
top ic -sh i f t s ,  in tu rn ,  a re  re la ted  to the 
conversant's shift ing goal structure.  This is 
especial ly true in task-oriented dialogues, where 
the component operations of the task are mirrored in 
the topic structure of the dialogue (Grosz, 1981). 
A general goal can be, therefore, sp l i t  into a 
sequence of subgoals bof/n because the task consists 
in reality of a sequence of subtasks (Grosz, 1981) 
and because of rhetorical reasons. This gives a 
very  spec ia l  s ta tus  to exchanges  in  our  
classif icat ion system. A transaction is in fact, 
divided into several exchanges determined either by 
the structure of the task to be carried out, or by 
rhetor i ca l  cons iderat ions ,  or by  both .  In 
particular, we should distinguish between two types 
of exchange: 
- a subtask exchange, which aims at reaching some 
substantive subgoal 
- an instrumental exchange, which aims at attaining 
some communicative (sub)goal, such as introducing 
the terms of the conversation, or clarifying some 
unclear substantive goal or subgoal. 
Every exchange is conloosed of moves and is, in most 
cases, opened by some form of topic shift ing move 
and  c losed  by  a conc lud ing  move.  Other  
sabcategories of exchanges can be found. However, a 
pattern of moves is associated with every exchange. 
At th is  leve l  d i f fe rent  rhetor i ca l  cho ices  
(motivated by C-goals) may appear in the form of 
different distr ibutions of instrumental or non-  
clar i fying exchanges within a transaction. The S- 
goals of an exchange can be computed  f rom the 
interpretat ion of the utterances comprising it, 
ut i l is ing some notion of general focus (Sidner, 
1979). 
At a lower level, the goals that motivate the moves 
are drawn equally from S-goals and C-goals. At the 
move level, the S-goal  s t ruc ture  becomes  less 
relevant to the sequence of moves. Moves are mostly 
rhetorical elements. They signal the pushing to a 
(new) topic (topic shifting and topic re-introducing 
moves) ,  the cont inuat ion  of a top ic  ( top ic  
44 
maintaining moves), and the popping of a topic (non- 
introduction). 
Push ing and popping are the opening and closing 
moves of an exchange. The coherence of the topic is 
to be expected within an exchange and should be 
perhaps checked from one move to the other. A topic 
shift is in itself a pushing move. The notion of 
topic probably coincides with the notion of focused 
goal. 
Moves serve as syntactic components of exchanges and 
every move is a step in a linguistic goal structure. 
Therefore, every exchange consists of a pattern of 
moves representing the communicative choices of the 
dialogue participants. In some cases, there is a 
correspondence between the S-goal associated with an 
exchange and some move (chal lenge) .  A l so  a 
communicative adherence between one move and the 
following should hold. Coherence means that the 
top ic  must be roughly the same, while adherence 
moans that the given move canbe followed only by a 
specific set ofmoves. 
Finally, an act is a limited linguistic act, uttered 
to effect very local communicative/rhetoric goals. 
In a dialogue most moves consists of a single act, 
but this does not. always hold. A distinction can be 
made at the act level between acts which are drawn 
from a l imited class of utterances, and acts which 
are not l imited in this way. We wil l  call these 
closed and open classes, respectively. Most of the 
closed class items are associated with acts which 
subserve C-goals rather than S-goals. This is not 
too surprising since the items from the closed class 
do not usually convey substantive information but 
usually serve as go-ahead signals in a dialogue. 
Whereas the primary function of open class items is 
to convey task-relevant information. 
4. SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE AND GOAL STRUCTURE 
From the previous paragraph it has been clear that 
there is a different distribution of S and C-goals 
a long the h ie rarchy  of d ia logue  un i ts .  In 
particular, higher level units are more related to 
S-goals, while low level units are connected to C- 
goals. 
The model presented is intended to serve main ly  
descr ip t ive  and representational purposes. No 
definition is given of the process of inference of 
the goal structure from the syntactic structure of 
dialogue. However it is possible to imagine that 
such a process rely, among others, on 
- the functions assigned to ~ialogue subunits 
- the actions mentioned in any specific utterance. 
5. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES 
The advantages of the proposed dialogue description 
system are the following: 
- the design of a grammar for the description of 
dialogue units and subunits is madepossible; 
- the distinction between S- and C-goals allows the 
treata~nt of possible interrupt and clarif ication 
subd ia logues  in the same frame as the goal 
directed parts of the dialogue; 
Fur ther  research  wi l l  be devoted  to the 
spec i f icat ion of a more deta i led grammar  of 
exchanges and moves, and to the establishing of a 
stricter correspondence between more types of goals. 
However ,  a stil l  more important point to be 
clarified is the specification of the for1~al devices 
by which the semantic (goal) structure can be 
inferred from utterance and act elements and 
'raised' to the higher dialogue units.
