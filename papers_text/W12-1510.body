Abstract 
Linguist?s Assistant (LA) is a large scale se-
mantic analyzer and multi-lingual natural lan-
guage generator designed and developed 
entirely from a linguist?s perspective.  The 
system incorporates extensive typological, 
semantic, syntactic, and discourse research in-
to its semantic representational system and its 
transfer and synthesizing grammars.  LA has 
been tested with English, Korean, Kewa (Pa-
pua New Guinea), Jula (Cote d?Ivoure), and 
North Tanna (Vanuatu), and proof-of-concept 
lexicons and grammars have been developed 
for Spanish, Urdu, Tagalog, Chinantec (Mexi-
co), and Angas (Nigeria).  This paper will 
summarize the major components of the NLG 
system, and then present the results of exper-
iments that were performed to determine the 
quality of the generated texts.  The experi-
ments indicate that when experienced mother-
tongue translators use the drafts generated by 
LA, their productivity is typically quadrupled 
without any loss of quality. 
1 Introduction 
The fundamental goal underlying LA was to de-
velop a system capable of generating high quality 
texts in a wide variety of languages, particularly 
minority and endangered languages.  Drafts pro-
duced by LA are always easily understandable, 
grammatically correct, semantically equivalent to 
the source documents, and at approximately a sixth 
grade reading level.  Because the system is based 
on linguistic research, LA is expected to work well 
for typologically diverse languages; it works equal-
ly well for languages that are coranking or clause 
chaining, highly isolating or highly polysynthetic, 
fusional or agglutinative, etc.  A natural language 
generator of this type is practical only when trans-
lating large quantities of texts into many different 
languages.  Therefore semantic representations for 
a large variety of texts are being developed for LA.  
This system is a tool which enables linguists to 
document a language and simultaneously generate 
numerous texts for the speakers of that language.  
A model of LA is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Model of Linguist?s Assistant 
As seen in the figure, there are five primary com-
ponents: 1) the ontology, 2) the semantic represen-
tations, 3) the lexicon, 4) the transfer grammar, and 
5) the synthesizing grammar.  The two components 
59
in ovals are static knowledge which is supplied 
with LA, and the three items in rectangles are user-
supplied target language knowledge.  The final 
product of LA is target text. 
2 The Ontology  
One of the foundational principles of Natural Se-
mantic Metalanguage theory (Goddard & 
Wierzbicka, 1994; Wierzbicka, 1996) proposes 
that there is a small set of innate concepts which 
are present in every language.  These innate con-
cepts can be used to explicate every word in every 
language.  If semantic representations were devel-
oped using only these innate primitives, the prob-
lem of lexical mismatch between languages would 
be eliminated.  However, building semantic repre-
sentations using only the innate concepts is un-
wieldy, so semantically simple molecules were 
identified in a principled manner.  For our seman-
tic molecules, we elected to use the defining vo-
cabulary in Longman?s Contemporary English 
Dictionary (2003).  By using these semantically 
simple concepts, the problem of lexical mismatch 
between source and target languages is significant-
ly reduced.  There are certainly still instances of 
lexical mismatch, and we have an approach for 
dealing with them which will be described below.  
LA also permits the automatic insertion of seman-
tically complex concepts into the semantic repre-
sentations, but only if the linguist indicates that the 
target language has a lexical equivalent. 
3 LA?s Semantic Representational System  
The development of an adequate method of mean-
ing representation for LA?s source texts proved to 
be a challenge.  Formal semantics (Cann, 1993; 
Rosner, 1992), conceptual semantics (Jackendoff, 
1990) and generative semantics (Lakoff, 1987) 
were each considered but found unsuitable because 
they didn?t include sufficient information for mi-
nority languages.  Therefore a new format was de-
veloped specifically for LA?s semantic 
representational system.  LA?s semantic represen-
tations are comprised of a controlled, English in-
fluenced metalanguage augmented by a feature 
system which was designed to accommodate a 
wide variety of languages.  Fundamentally these 
semantic representations consist of concepts, struc-
tures, and features.  The concepts that are permit-
ted in the semantic representations are all semanti-
cally simple as was described earlier.  The struc-
tures permitted in the semantic representations are 
a small restricted set of English-like sentence 
structures.  The feature system developed for LA 
includes semantic, syntactic, and discourse infor-
mation.  The feature values have been gleaned 
from a wide variety of diverse languages.  Table 1 
shows a few examples of these features and their 
values.

The semantic representation for ?Paulus started

Terpen? is shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. LA?s Semantic Representational System 
As seen in Figure 2, every concept, phrase, and 
proposition has numerous features associated with 
it; the letters and numbers below the concepts and 
beside the phrase and proposition boundaries rep-
resent specific feature values.  For example, the 
60
phrase containing Paulus has its Semantic Role set 
to Agent, the phrase containing market has its Se-
mantic Role set to Source, the phrase containing 
village has its Semantic Role set to Destination, the 
event walk has its Time set to Discourse and its 
Aspect set to Inceptive, the proposition?s Illocu-
tionary Force is set to Declarative and its Salience 
Band is set to Pivotal Storyline, etc. 
4 LA?s Lexicon  
The target lexicon serves as a repository for all of 
the target language?s words and their associated 
features and forms.  Within the lexicon a linguist 
defines the features that are pertinent to each syn-
tactic category for his particular target language.  
For example, each noun can be assigned a gender 
value, an honorific value, a class value, etc.  Simi-
larly the required forms are defined in the target 
lexicon (e.g., English verbs have a stem plus a past 
tense form, a perfect participle form, a gerund 
form, and a third singular present form).  Then lex-
ical spellout rules are used to generate the various 
forms of each target word.  All instances of supple-
tion are entered into the target lexicon manually.  
5 LA?s Transfer Grammar  
The purpose of LA?s transfer grammar1 is to re-
structure the English influenced semantic represen-
tations in order to produce a new underlying 
representation that is appropriate for the target lan-
guage.  This new underlying representation con-
sists of the target language?s words, structures, and 
features.  For example, many languages have rules 
that are based on grammatical relations, but the 
object phrases in the semantic representations are 
marked with semantic roles rather than grammati-
cal relations.  Therefore a rule in the transfer 
grammar must generate grammatical relations from 
the semantic roles.  For another example, many 
languages in the world are clause chaining rather 
than coranking, so a rule in the transfer grammar 
must build appropriate clause chains from the 
coranking propositions in the semantic representa-
                                                          
1 The translation process is often divided into three fundamen-
tal steps: 1) analysis: analyze the source document to deter-
mine its meaning, 2) transfer: reconstruct that meaning using 
the target language?s lexemes, structures, and world view, and 
3) synthesis: synthesize the final surface forms.  The term 
?Transfer Grammar? here refers to the grammar in LA that 
performs the second step of the translation process.   
tions.  A model of LA?s transfer grammar is shown 
in Figure 3.  The transfer grammar consists of nine 
different types of rules, several of which will be 
briefly described below. 
 
Figure 3. Model of LA?s Transfer Grammar 
Complex Concept Insertion Rules: These rules 
are prebuilt for specific complex concepts and may 
be activated by the user if his target language has a 
lexical equivalent for a particular complex concept.  
For example, the concept blind is semantically 
complex and is not permitted in the semantic rep-
resentations.  Whenever the adjective ?blind? is 
used attributively in a source document, it is re-
placed in the semantic representations with the rel-
ative clause who is not able to see.  But if the 
target language has a lexical equivalent for blind, 
the user can activate the complex concept insertion 
rule which will replace all occurrences of who is 
not able to see in the semantic representations with 
blind.  
Styles of Direct Speech: Many languages employ 
techniques for indicating relative status when two 
people talk to one another.  Therefore in the se-
mantic representations all propositions that are di-
61
rect speech are marked with five features indicat-
ing: 1) the general category of the speaker (e.g., 
father, mother, child, political leader, religious 
leader, employer, employee, etc.), 2) the general 
category of the listener, 3) the speaker?s attitude, 4) 
the speaker?s approximate age, and 5) the age of 
the speaker relative to the listener.  Linguists are 
able to define the styles of direct speech that are 
pertinent to the target language, and then use these 
features and rules to set the style appropriately.  
Subsequent rules then insert the appropriate pro-
nouns or honorific morphology to indicate the rela-
tive status of the speaker to the listener. 
Relative Clause Strategies: Extensive typological 
research has been done regarding relative clauses 
(Comrie 1989:138, Giv?n 1990:645), and linguists 
have found that languages apply a limited number 
of strategies to a limited number of grammatical 
relations in what is commonly called the NP Ac-
cessibility Hierarchy (Keenan & Comrie 1977, 
Comrie 1989:156).  Cross-linguistically relative 
clauses may be classified as either embedded or 
adjoined.  If a language uses embedded relative 
clauses, they may be pre-nominal, post-nominal, or 
circum-nominal.  If a language uses adjoined rela-
tive clauses, they are either sentence initial or sen-
tence final.  There are generally three strategies for 
encoding the coreferential noun in a relative 
clause: the gap strategy, the pronoun retention 
strategy, and the relative pronoun strategy.  The 
relative clause rules in LA enable a linguist to de-
scribe what types of relative clauses are employed 
in his target language, and which strategies are 
used at the various positions in the Accessibility 
Hierarchy. 
Collocation Correction Rules:  Collocation deals 
with how certain words go together, and how 
words and phrases co-occur with certain grammat-
ical choices.  Every word in every language has its 
own collocational range and restrictions.  There-
fore collocation correction rules are used to change 
one target word to another target word in a particu-
lar environment.  For example, in English a king 
wears his crown, but in Korean, a king ?? [sseu 
da] uses his crown.  So a collocation correction 
rule will change the Korean verb ?? [ip da] ?to 
wear? to ?? [sseu da] ?to use? whenever the agent 
is a king or queen and the patient is a crown. 
Theta Grid Adjustment Rules:  Every verb in 
every language has an associated theta grid which 
describes its argument structure.  The theta grids 
for the events in the semantic representations are 
very similar to the theta grids for the equivalent 
English verbs.  However, the verbs in other lan-
guages have different argument structures, so the 
theta grid adjustment rules enable a linguist to easi-
ly restructure an event?s arguments according to 
the theta grid of the target language?s equivalent 
verb.  The Korean theta grid adjustment rule for 
the concept walk is shown in Figure 4.  That rule 
inserts the appropriate Korean postpositions into 
the source and destination phrases. 
 
Figure 4. Korean Theta Grid Adjustment Rule 
Structural Adjustment Rules: The structural ad-
justment rules are used to restructure the semantic 
representations in any way that?s necessary in or-
der to construct an appropriate underlying repre-
sentation for the target language.  These rules may 
be used to handle lexical mismatch, convert predi-
cate adjective constructions to verbal construc-
tions, build clause chains from coranking 
propositions, make adjustments for various views 
of time, etc.  The structural adjustment rules look 
identical to the theta grid adjustment rule shown in 
Figure 4, but they are grouped separately because 
they perform a variety of tasks.   
The final product of the transfer grammar is a 
new underlying representation that is appropriate 
for the target language.  This underlying represen-
tation consists of the target language?s words, 
structures, and features.  This underlying represen-
tation serves as the input to the synthesizing 
grammar. 
6 LA?s Synthesizing Grammar  
LA?s synthesizing grammar is responsible for syn-
thesizing the final surface forms of the target text.  
62
LA?s synthesizing grammar was designed to re-
semble as closely as possible the descriptive 
grammars that field linguists routinely write.  Be-
fore developing this grammar, dozens of descrip-
tive grammars written by field linguists were 
examined in order to observe the capabilities that 
are required to synthesize surface text.  A model of 
the final result is shown in Figure 5, and several of 
these rule types will be briefly described below. 
 
 
Figure 5. Model of LA?s Synthesizing Grammar 
Feature Copying Rules: The feature copying 
rules copy features from one constituent to another 
constituent so that the spellout rules can add the 
necessary morphology to indicate appropriate 
agreement.  For example, certain Jula nouns agree 
in person and number with their object nouns, so a 
feature copying rule copies the person and number 
of the object noun to the verb.  Then a spellout rule 
adds the appropriate morphology to the verb. 
Spellout Rules: The spellout rules add contextual 
morphology in order to synthesize the final form of 
each target word.  There are four basic types of 
spellout rules: (i) simple spellout rules which add a 
prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix, or a new word to an 
existing word, or they provide a new translation of 
a particular target word in a given context; (ii) 
form selection rules which select a form of a target 
word from the target lexicon; (iii) morphophone-
mic rules which perform morphophonemic opera-
tions on the affixes that were added to the stem; 
and (iv) table spellout rules which group a com-
mon set of affixes together into a single rule.  After 
these spellout rules have been executed, each target 
word is in its final surface form. A table spellout 
rule that adds tense suffixes to Kewa verbs is 
shown in Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6. Spellout Rule that adds Kewa Tense Affixes 
Clitic Rules: Linguists have found that languages 
employ three different types of clitics (Payne, 
1997): (i) pre-clitics which attach to the beginning 
of the first word in a phrase, (ii) second position 
clitics which attach to the end of the first word in a 
phrase, and (iii) post-clitics which attach to the end 
of the last word in a phrase.  A clitic rule that adds 
the post-clitic ?me to Kewa subjects is shown in 
Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7. A Clitic Rule for Kewa 
Pronoun Rules: There are no pronouns in the 
semantic representations because each language 
63
has its own rules for determining when and where 
pronouns are appropriate.  Therefore, after the 
phrase structure rules have moved each constituent 
into its final position, the pronoun rules identify 
the nominals that should be realized with pro-
nouns, and then supply the appropriate surface 
forms. 
Word Morphophonemic Rules: The word mor-
phophonemic rules are similar to the morphopho-
nemic rules described in the spellout rule section 
above, but these morphophonemic rules operate 
across word boundaries rather than morpheme 
boundaries.  For example, the English indefinite 
article a changes to an whenever the next word 
begins with a vowel. 
7 LA?s Target Text  
After the synthesizing grammar has been executed 
and produced the final form of the target text, 
mother-tongue speakers edit the text to improve 
the naturalness and information flow.  Samples of 
English and Korean texts generated by LA are 
shown in Figure 8.  The texts in that figure have 
not been edited; they are the actual texts that were 
generated by LA.  These texts occur at the begin-
ning of a story that describes how to prevent the 
spread of Avian Influenza. 
One day a doctor named 
Paulus returned from the 
market to his village named 
Terpen. While Paulus had 
been at the market, some 
people had told him about a 
certain disease. So when 
Paulus returned to his vil-
lage, he said to Isak, who 
was the village chief, and 
the other people who lived 
in Terpen, "A new disease 
named Avian Influenza has 
killed most of the birds that 
are at the market. This dis-
ease has killed many chick-
ens and many ducks.

8 LA?s Results  
Extensive grammars and lexicons were developed 
for English, Korean, Kewa, and Jula.  We began 
each project by working through a set of sentences 
called the Grammar Introduction.  The Grammar 
Introduction consists of approximately 500 basic 
sentences, each illustrating a particular feature or 
construction of the semantic representational sys-
tem.  For example, the Grammar Introduction in-
cludes a series of propositions dealing with the 
various tenses, aspects, and moods, there?s a set of 
propositions dealing with relative clauses, object 
complement clauses, and adverbial clauses, anoth-
er set of propositions dealing with pronouns, etc.  
After completing the Grammar Introduction 2 , a 
very thorough foundation has been developed for 
the lexicon and grammar, but the Grammar Intro-
duction is intentionally restricted to a very small 
set of concepts.  Therefore rules that deal with 
concept-specific issues must be dealt with while 
working through actual texts.  While working 
through the semantic representations of these texts, 
a very clear trend developed for each of the test 
languages: the number of new grammatical rules 
required per chapter of text decreased very quickly 
as seen in Figures 9 through 12.

duction took approximately 40 to 50 hours.

The graphs shown above conclusively demonstrate 
that the grammars developed in LA are accurately 
capturing the significant generalizations of these 
four languages. 
9 Quality of Generated Texts  
After generating texts in Korean, Kewa, and Jula, 
experiments were performed to determine whether 
or not the drafts generated by LA are of sufficient 
quality that they improve the productivity of expe-
rienced mother-tongue translators.  Two sets of 
experiments were performed: the first set tested for 
increased productivity, and the second set tested 
for quality.  The first set compared the quantity of 
text an experienced translator could translate in a 
given period of time with the quantity of text gen-
erated by LA that the same person could edit in the 
given time.  Eight professional mother-tongue 
translators participated in the Jula experiment, one 
translator participated in the Kewa experiment, and 
eighteen translators participated in the Korean ex-
periment.  In these experiments, quantity was de-
termined by word count.  Table 2 summarizes the 
results of these productivity experiments. 
Language Ratio of Edited Words to 
Manually Translated Words 
Jula 4.3 
Kewa 6.7 
Korean 4.6 
Table 2. Summary of Productivity Experiments 
The table shown above indicates that in each test 
language, the drafts generated by LA were of such 
high quality that they more than quadrupled the 
productivity of experienced mother-tongue transla-
tors.  The results of these experiments were cer-
tainly encouraging, but at this point we didn?t 
know whether or not the editors had done a thor-
ough job of editing the generated texts.  Therefore 
we performed another set of experiments to deter-
mine whether or not the edited texts were compa-
rable in quality with professionally translated texts. 
10 Quality of Edited Texts  
The second set of experiments was performed with 
Jula and Korean speakers in order to determine the 
quality of the edited LA drafts.  Speakers of these 
languages were asked to compare the edited LA 
texts with the manually translated texts.  These 
evaluations were performed by people who did not 
know how either of the texts had been produced.  
Forty evaluations were performed by Jula speak-
ers, and 192 evaluations were performed by Kore-
an speakers.  Although no evaluations were 
performed by Kewa speakers, the edited Kewa 
draft was ultimately published.  Table 3 summariz-
es the Jula and Korean evaluations.

Table 3. Summary of the Evaluation Experiments 
In Table 3, the column labeled ?LA Texts? indi-
cates the number of evaluators who said that the 
edited LA text was better3 than the manually trans-
lated text, the column labeled ?Manual Texts? in-
dicates the number of evaluators who said the 
manually translated text was better than the edited 
LA text, and the column labeled ?Equal? indicates 
the number of evaluators who said that the edited 
LA text was equal in quality to the manually trans-
                                                          
3 The term ?better? is intentionally very generic.  We didn?t 
want to ask the evaluators which text was more natural, or was 
easier to read, etc.  Instead we let the evaluators choose 
whichever text they thought was better for any reason. 
65
lated text.  In both languages the evaluation exper-
iments indicate that the edited LA texts are consid-
ered as good as the manually translated texts. 
11 Conclusions  
LA is a tool which drastically reduces the amount 
of time and effort required to produce an initial 
draft of a translation of a text.  This tool enables 
linguists to build large scale lexicons and gram-
mars for a very wide variety of languages, particu-
larly minority and endangered languages.  After a 
lexicon and grammar have been completed, LA 
generates drafts of texts which are at approximate-
ly a sixth grade reading level.  We hope to eventu-
ally have a large library of community 
development texts which will describe how to pre-
vent the spread of various diseases such as AIDS, 
Avian Influenza, etc.  This tool works equally well 
for languages that are thoroughly studied, lan-
guages that have only slightly been studied, and 
languages that are endangered.  Similarly, this tool 
works equally well for languages that are typologi-
cally diverse with respect to their morphological 
and syntactic features.  It is hoped that this tool 
will empower speakers of minority languages 
around the world by providing them with transla-
tions of vital information, which will not only ena-
ble them to live longer, healthier, and more 
productive lives, but will also enable them to par-
ticipate in the larger world.
