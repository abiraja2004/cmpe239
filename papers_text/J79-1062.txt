This knowledae base  is  made UD o f  static  
domain-specif  ic knowledge ( both f a c t u a l  and jud m e n t a l )  
and dynamf,~ knowledge specific to a particular problem' 
1.2 Performance Characteristics of  an Explanation Capability 
The purpose of  an explanation c a ~ a b i l i t v  (KC) i s  t o  qive the user 
access to  a s  much of the system s knowledge as posbible. Ideal ly ,  i t  should 
be easy for  a user t o  get a complete, understandable answer t o  anv sor t  of 
question about t h e  system's knowledge and  pera at ion -- both i n  general, and 
with  reference t o  a particular consultation. This l l p l i e s  three major goals 
i n  t h e  development of an explanation capabili ty.  
1) To ensure that the EC can handle questions about a l l  
relevant aspects o f  the system'$ knowledge and actions. It 
should be capable of giving a few baslo types of 
explanations, for  example. 
How it made a certain decision 
How i t  used a piece of information 
What decision ~t made about aome subproblem 
Why i t  didn  t use a certain plece of  information 
Why it  failed t o  ma!ce a certain decision 
Why it required a cer ta in  piece o f  in forna t lon  
Why it didn t require a certain ~ i e c e  of information 
How i t  w i l l  find o u t  a certain plece of Information 
[while tRe consultatinn i s  i n  oroqress] 
What the system i s  currently doing? [while t h e  
consultation is i n  ~ r o a r e s s ]  
The mec i f i c  s e t  of explanation types which are chosen as 
basics, however, w i l l  depend on the part icular  system. 
2 )  To enable t h e  user t o  get an explanation which 
answers t h e  question completely and comprehensively. 
3)  To make the EC easy t o  use. A novice should be able 
t o  use t h e  EC without f i r s t  spending a large amount of time 
lehrninq how to  request explanations. 
We will d i s t i n g u i s h  two s l ighf ly  different  functions f o r  an EC and 
d i v i d e  it into two components. the reasoning-status checker (RSC) t o  be used 
during t h e  consultation, and the general question answerqr (GQA) t o  be used 
during the consultation or af ter  the system has  ~ r i n t e d  its results.

1.3 Knowledge Requirements of an Exp lana t ion  Capability 
An EC must know what is i n  t h e  system's knowledge base, and how it 
is organized.  In  o rde r  t o  give e x p l a n a t i o n s  o f  t h e  svstem's c u r r e n t  ( o r  
p r e v i o u s )  actions, an  EC also needs  t o  unders tand  how t h e  system s r u l e  
i n t e r p r e t e r  works. when ruces w ~ l l  be  tried how t h e y  can fall, what c a u s e s

a$ a basis fbr  e x p l a i n i n g  t h e  r e s u l t s  of that  c a n s u l t a t i o n .  
A r e a s o n i n g - s t a t u s  checker  w i l l  need d record o f  what t h e  system h a s

e x p l a i n  why it was necessary  to u s e  t h i s  rule, or may affect  which fu tupe  
rules w i l l  be t r l e d .  
A g e n e r a l  quest ion-answerer  will need more ~ n f o m a t l o n  about t h e  
system since t h e  scope o f  i t s  e x p l a n a t i o n s  is much broader .  i ts  t a s k  is t o  
answer g e n e r a l  questions about  Lhe system's knowledge base. To do this, i t  
must know how the system stores knowledge about i t s  area of e x p e r t i s e  ( t h e  
static kdowledge with which it starts each c o n s u l t a t i o n )  and how it stores 
facts gathered  d u r i n g  a p a r t i c u l a r  c o n s u l t a t i o n  (its dynamlc knowledge).

A c l i n i c a l  pa rame te r ' s  v a l u e  may be de t e rmined  by a s k i n g  t h e  user,

Each d e c i s i o n  r u l e  has a s i t u a t i o r l  p a r t  called i ts  PREMISE. This

Each c o n t e x t  is named uniquely, allowing the system t o  refer t o  
CULTURE-2, meaning t h e  second culture, o r  ORGANISM-3, meaning t h e  third

context tree, which defines r e l a t i o n s h i p s  among them. For example, an 
organism is t h e  d i r e c t  descendent  of' t h e  c u l t u r e  from w h i c l ~  it was isolated.

The rule i n t e r p r e t e r  (MYCIV'S c o n t r o l  s t r u c t u r e ,  described i n  detail

parameters  i n  a given c o n t e x t .  A r u l e  is app l i ed  t o  t h e  lowest c o n t e x t  i n  
t h e  c o n t e x t  tree whose parameters  are mentioned by the  rule .  The r u l e  can 
use ( o r  conclude abou t )  parameters of t h i s  c o n t e x t ,  o r  of anv  c o n t e x t  which 
1s i t s  ancestor I n  t h e  tree. For example, i f  RULE209 were apolied t o  
ORGANISM-3 (see Figure 3) i t  would need t h e  S I T E  of the culture from which 
t h e  STREPTOCOCCUS was i so la ted .  The tree ind ica te s  t h a t  t h i s  is CULTURE-2, 
Rather t h a n  being a s e q u e n t i a l  c y c l e  throuqh t h e  rule set ,  wher-e 
each  rule is  t r i e d  i n  some predetepmined order, t h e  flow of  c o n t r o l  is qoal -  
directed. This means that only rules which conclllde about t h e  c u r r e n t  goal 
(to f ind  out the value of a given parameter )  are examined. The PREMISE of 
one of these rules may need t o  use  some ~ a r a m e t e r  whose va lue  is unknown, 
This sets  up a subgoal, namely t o  deterqine t h e  v a l u e  of t h i s  parameter so  
that t h e  r u l e  can be used.  MYCIN's goal-direcrted approach means t h a t  t h e  
system (and n o t  the user) takes t h e  initiative d u r i n g  a c o n s u l t a t i o n .  The

2.2.3 Organization of Factual Knowledge 
As discussed i n  Section 2 . 1 ,  a l l  knowledge which is gathered durinq 
t h e  consultation i s  organized into attribute-object-value triples. For 
consistency, many facts i n  t h e  static knowledqe base also have t h i s  format. 
This  includes objects such as bacteria and antibiotics,  and attributes such 
as  t h e  staininrg characteristics of a bacterium or t h e  recommended dosage of 
an antibiot ic  : 
ATTRIBUTE OBJECT VALUE 
------.I-- ------ ----- 
GRAM E .COLI GRAMNEG 
DOSE GENTAMICIN 1.7 mq kg q8h IV (or IM) 
The remainder of the factual knowledge consists o f  l i s t s  and tables: 
pieces of aedical knowledge, organized m such a way t h a t  they can be used 
t o  augment the  producbion rules. For example, one such piece of knowledqe 
is the l ist of the possible culture s i tes  which are normallv nonsterile, 
NONSTERILESITES : ( CERVIX CUTANEOUS-ULCER LOCHIA NOSE SKIN 
STOOL THROAT URETHRA VAGINA) 
The l ikely pathogens associated with the different culture s i t e s  are 
organized i n  a table, with different entries for the different s i t e s ,  
PATH-FLORA 
-------..-- 
THROAT : (STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE STREPTOCOCCUS- 
GROUP-A NEISSERI A-MENINGITIDIS )

GROUP-A STAPHYLOCOCCUS-COAG-NEG) 
CERVIX: ( STREPTOCOCCUS CLOST RIDIUM-GANGRENE 
NEISSERIA-GONORRHA STREPTOCOCCUS- 
GROUP-A ) 
Production rules can make use of t h i s  tabularized information: 
RULE058 
--"-I-- 
If: 1 )  The s i t e  of  the culture is one of :  those sites 
that are normally nonsterile, and 
2 )  This organism and at least one of t h e  likely 
pathogens associated with t h e  s i t e  of t h e  c u l t u r e  
agree wi'th respect to  t h e  following properties: 
gram morph air 
Then: There i s  strongly sugaestive evidence (.9) that 
each o f  these pathogens is the i d e n t i t v  of the 
organism 
Note that the information i n  t h e  table could have been 0r~anized as 
attribute-object-value triples (where the object would be a culture site). 
If t h i s  had been done, however, the above rule could not have been written. 
To accomplish the same purpose (without a change i n  the  control structure), 
the svstem would have needed several rules -- a separate one for each entry 
i n  the table. Structurinq certain facts into l ists  an.d tables er~ables 
individual product ion rules t o  exDress general theories which allow a number 
of specific deduct ions t o  be made. 
2.2.2 Procedural Knowledge 
Each o f  MYCIN'S approximately 400 rules i s  composed of a small 
number of conceptual primitives. A total  of  60 such primitives make up the 
language i n  which rules &re written, This design f a c i l i t a t e d  the 
implementation of a mechanisp for translating rules in to  Enql iah ( d e s c r i b e d  
i n  detail i n  171). Each p r i m i t i v s  functions has a translation template w i t h  
blanks to  be filled i n  with translations of the function's arquments. A 
larrr;e part of MYCIN'S exolanation c a p a b i l i t v  depends on t h i s  abi l i ty  to 
translate rules into a form t h a t  the user can understand. 
Having a small number of rule components a lso  faci l i tates  the 
examination of rules t o  see which might be apnlicable t o  the  explanation a t  
hand. MYCIN'S knowledge of production ru les ,  therefore, takes t h e  form of  a 
general mechanlsrn for "readinq" rules,  On t h e  o t h e r  hand, no attempt has 
been made t o  read t h e  code o f  the rule interpreter. Procedural knowledge 
about the interpreter is embodied i n  n s p e c i a l i s t s u ,  epch capable of 
answerinq a single type o f  question. Each specialist knows how the re levant  
part of the c o n t r o l  structure works and what pieces  of knowledge it  uses. 
I n  order t o  understand r u l e s ,  the system's various specialists use a 
small amount o f  knowledge about rules in general, tosether with descriptions 
or templates of each of  the rule components. A s  an example, t h e  following 
rule i s  composed o f  t h e  units S A N D ,  SAME, and CONCLUDE.

Using t emp la t e s  o f  t h e  v a r l o u s  ACTION f u n c t i o n s  which appear i n  each o f

2.2.3 The History Tree 
Many of t h e  exp lana t ion  capability's specialists need a record o f  
the c o n s u l t a t i o n .  This record 1s b u i l t  d u r i n g  t h e  c o n s u l t a t i o n ,  and is 
organized into a t ree  s t r u c t u r e  called t h e  history tree which reflects 
MYCIN'S goal -d i rec ted  approach. Each node i n  the tree r e p r e s e n t s  a goal and 
c o n t a i n s  Informat ion  about how t h e  system tried t o  accomplish this goa l :  bv 
a s k i n g  t h e  user  o r  by t r y i n g  r u l e s .  Associated with each r u l e  i s  a record  
of whether t h e  rule succeeded, and i f  n o t ,  why it f a i l e d .  If t r y i n g  some 
r u l e  c ause s  t h e  system t o  trace a new parameter ,  thereby setting up a 
subgoal, the node for t h i s  subgoal is the offspring of the node containins 
the rule which caused the t r a c i n g .  Figure 4 i l l u s t r a t e s  how part  of  ii

2.2.4 Other Doma in-Independent Knowledge 
i 
MYCIN'S question-answering a b i l i t y  i s  limited to describing the 
- 
system's ac t ions ,  and explaining what facts  the system knows. Some of the 
specialists for answering questions about the consultation make use of  loqic 
J 
goal:  GRAM of  ORGANISM-1 
ask: question 1 1  
i n  arriving at t h e i r  answers. In particular,  t o  explain why a decis ion

wasn 't ade, the appropriate specialist uses t h e  logical conclusion t h a t  the 
answer consists of  e x ~ l a i n i n g  what prevented the system from us ing  each o f

If deduc t ions  or comparisons are needed to answer questions of a 
specific type ,  t h e n  t h e  necessary logic  is b u i l t  into the appropriate 
specialist. There i s  no general r ep re sen ta t i on  of knowledge about logic, 
arithmetic, o r  set t h e o r y  that t h e  explanation capabil i ty  can use t o  make 
inferences from dif ferent  facts  in its knowledge base. To find out whether 
ORGANISM- I and ORGANISM-2 have t h e  same identity, f o r  example, it is 
necessary f o r  t h e  user t o  ask separately f o r  t h e  i d e n t i t y  of each organism, 
t h en  bo compare t h e  answers t o  these questions. 
2.3 Scope of MYC~N'S Explana t ion  Capability 
The ourpose of t h e  explanation system is t o  enable a user  t o  see how 
MCIN makes decisions, both i n  general and with r e f e r e n c e  t o  a particular 
consultation. To make t h i s  f a c i l i t y  as useful as possible,  we have t r l e d  t o  
an t idpa t e  a11 t y p e s  of q u e s t i o n s  whlch a user rnlpht ask, and t o  make every 
part of t h e  system's khowledge base and reaqoning process accessible through 
clear explanations, 
The entire explanat ion f ac i l i t y  consists of  a number of components 
or wspecialistsm each capable of  giving a single type o f  explanation. These 
components are grouped into three sets: one for explaining what the system 
i s  doing a t  a given time, one for answering questions about t h e  system's 
s t a t i c  knowledge base, and one f o r  answering quest ions  about t h e  dynamic 
knowledge base. The f i r& set  forms MYCIN 's reasoning-status checker ; the 
second and t h i r d  together make up the system s general question-answer. 
2.3.1 MYCIN 'a Reasoning-St atus Cheaker 
Whenever MYCIN asks a q u e s t i o n ,  t h e  user i s  a l l o w e d  to  interrogate 
the  status  o f  MYCIN'S r eanon inq  c h a i n  bv a s k i n g  WHY this piece of 
information i s  important. As explained in  s e c t i o n s  2. 1 and 2.2, the system 
asks a quest ion  i n  order to f i n d  out about its curpent goal .  Conslder t h e

The ffreasonff for  adkinq whether t h e  infection was hospital-acquired, then, 
is based on an attempt t o  use t h i s  rule t o  determxne the  h i ~ h e r  subgoal. 
The answer to  WHY a t  t h i s  p a n t  i s  simply a display of t h e  goals and the 
rules linkin8 them. We have given considerable attention t o  rnakin~ t h i s  as 
l u c i d  a display as p o s s i b l e .  First, s i n c e  mwhvrf has several o t h e r  
interpretations,  and no more extensive natural languase processinq is  used 
in this component of MYCIN'S E C ,  the q u e s t i o n  is expanded to i n d i c a t e  t h e  
sense i n  which it w i l l  be  answered. The higher g o a l  i s  then p r e s e n t e d ,  
f o l l o w e d  bv t h e  r u l e .  The clauses  i n  the PREMISE of the rule are d i v i d e d  
into those a l r e a d y  e s f . a b l i s h e d  and those  y e t  t o  be de termined .  F i n a l l y ,  
since rules may have multiple conelusions about d i f f e r e n t  c l i n i c a l  
parameters, the relevant conclusion i s  presented first and all others 
fb l low.  
A s  Fiaure 5 i l l u s t r a t e s ,  f u r t h e r  sections of  the reasoning chain can 
be examined by repeat ing  the  WHY command. For any of t h e  subgoa l s  mentioned

type includes a variety of ways in which the question can be worded, some 
specifying the parameter's value ,  some phrased in the  negative, and so 
forth. MYCIN'S natural-language Drocessor must classify the questions, then 
determine what cllnLcal parameters, etc. t h e  question references. 
2,4 Understanding The Question 
The main emphasis i n  t h e  development of t h e  MYCIV system h a s  been 
the c r e a t i o n  of a product ion  system which can provide  sound d i a q n o a t i c  and 
t h e r a p e u t i c  adv ice  i n  the field of i n f e c t i o u s  disease. The explanation 
sfatem was inc luded  i n  t h e  system's o r i g i n a l  des iqn  i n  order  t o  make t h e  
c o n s u l t a t i o n  program's d e c i s i o n s  a c c e p t a b l e ,  j u s t i f i a b l e ,  and i n s t r u c t i v e .  
S i n c e  t h e  quest ion-answerina f a c i l i t y  was n o t  t h e  primary focus  o f  t h e  
research, it is not des igned  t o  be  a sophisticated natural-lanquage 
unders t ander .  Rather ,  i t  u s e s  c rude  t e c h n i q y e s ,  r e l y i n g  s t r o n g l y  on t h e  
ve ry  s p e c i f i c  vocabulary of t h e  domain, t o  l l ~ n d e r s t a n d ~ ~  whst i n fo rmat ion  i s  
being requested. 
The analysis o f  a q u e s t i o n  i s  broken i n t o  three phases:  t h e  first 
c r e a t e s  a list of terminal or r o o t  words; t h e  second de te rmines  what type of 
q u e s t i o n  i s  beinq asked (see t h e  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n  o f  q u e s t i o n s  i n  Section 
2.3) ;  and t h e  l a s t  de te rmines  what p a r t i c u l a r  parameters, lists, etc. are 
r e l e v a n t  t o  the q u e s t i o n .  
I n  t h e  first and l a s t  s t e p s ,  t h e  system d i c t i o n a r y  is impor tan t ,  
The d i c t i o n a r y  Conta ins  approximate ly  1400 words t h a t  are commonly used  in 
the domain of i n f e c t i o u s  disease. It if ic ludes  a l l  words that are a c c e p t a b l e  
v a l u e s  f o r  a parameter ,  common synonyms of t h e s e  words, and words used 
elsewhere by t h e  system i n  d e s c r i b i n g  the parameter ( e . q . ,  when translating 
a rule i n t o  Eng l i sh  o r  r e q u e s t i n g  t h e  value of t h e  parameter). 
2.4.1 Reducing the Question t o  Terminal Words 
Each word in the dictionary has a synonym p o i n t e r  t o  i ts t e r m i n a l  
word (terminal words p o i n t  t o  themselbes) .  F o r  the purpose of  analyzing the  
q u e s t i o n ,  a non-terminal  word is cons idered  t o  be equivalent  t o  its 
( terminal) aynonym. 
Terminal words may have p r o p e r t i e s  i n d i c a t i n g :  
1) t h a t  t h i s  word is an  acceptable value for  some 
c l i n i c a l  parameter(s) 
2)  t h a t  this word always i m p l i c a t e s  a certain c l i n i c a l  
parameter ,  system l i s t ,  o r  table (e.g. t h e  word " i d e n t i t v l l  
always impl icates  t h e  parameter  IDENTITY, which means t h e  
i d e n t i t y  of an  organism) 
3) t h a t  this word might Xmplicate a c e r t a i n  parameter, 
system l i s t ,  o r  table (e.3. t h e  word t l p o s i t i v e n  might  
i m p l i c a t e  t h e  parameter  NUMPOS, which means the number o f  
p o s i t i v e  c u l t u r e s  i n  a series) 
4 )  t h a t  t h i s  word is part of a p h r a s e  which can be 
thought  of  a s  a sinqle word (examples of such phrases are

table has an a s s o c i a t e d  list of key words t h a t  are commonly used when 
t a l k i n g  about this parameter ,  l ist, or table. These words are d i v i d e d  
according t o  hoM s u r e  we can be  that  a d o c t o r  is referring t o  this

During t h e  f irs t  phase o f  parsing, e a c h  word i n  t h e  o r i g i n a l  t e x t  is

b u i l t - i n  knowledge about  t h e  r u l e  set,  p l u s  t h e  a b i l i t y  t o  tlreadll t h e  rules. 
By t h e  time t h e  question has been ana lyzed ,  the m e c i a l i s t  knows exactly 
which parameters  must appear  i n  the PREMISE, and which must apDear i n  the 
ACTION of any rule which answers t h e  ques t i on .  Values may be s p e c i f i e d  f o r  
any of t h e  parameters. To answer t h e  question, t h e  r u l e - r e t r i e v a l  s p e c i a l i s t  
must f i r s t  f i n d  eve ry  rule whose PREMISE and ACTION satisfy t h e s e  
constraints. To do t h i s ,  i t  needs t o  know t h a t  there are two special lists 
associated with each parameter: one contain in^ every rule that uses the 
parameter i n  its PREMISE, and the other containinq every rule t h a t  concludes 
about the parameter i n  its ACTION. Using these l ists for  t h e  various 
parameters mentioned i n  the quest ion,  the spec ia l i s t  can find those rules 
that  might answer the question. I f  no values were soecified, the job is 
done a n d  t h e  relevant rules can b e  displayed without further anslvsis; 
otherwise, i t  i s  necessary t o  read each of the rules i n  t he  l ist  and to  
eliminate those which do n o t  mention the correct values f o r  t h e  ~arameter ,  
The rule-retrieval specia l is t  also makes use of a piece of MYCIN'S 
knowledge which was not discussed ear l ie r .  The system contains models of 
i t s  own knowledge (cal led rule models) which are used primarily during 
acquisition of new medical knowledge from an expert [4]. These models, 
however, can be put to many uses -- one is  t o  explain aeneral patterns i n  
decision making. The rule models are abstract  descriptions of a subsets o f  
rules and are generated automatically by readinq the rules. For  examole, 
t h e  model for IDENT-IS-PSEUDOMONAS tells what features are common t o  the 
majority of rules which conclude t h a t  t h e  ident i ty  of an oraanism i s  
pseudomonas . 
I f  a model exists describing t h e  rules about which the question is  
asking, t he  rule-retrieval soecialist incorporates t h i s  model's information 
i n t o  i t s  answer (Figure 11). Thus the question-answering facility is able 
t o  give some information about s t ra tegies  for achieving some of the svstem's 
goals, as  well as t h e  individual rules which use t h e  s trateqies.

In questicns asking about  the a p p l i c a t i o n  of  a r u l e  t o  a c o n t e x t  
there are three poss*~bi l i t ies :  the ru l e  told u s  somethinq abou t  t h e  c o n t e x t ;  
t h e  rule f a i l ed  when applier! t o  that context; or t h e  rule was never tried i n

Furthermore, if a rule succeeded, there is a record of all the conclusions

could not a p p l y  t o  t h e  context mentioned i n  t h e  q u e s t i o n ,  b u t  m i ~ h t  be 
relevant when appl i ed  t o  soae o t h e r  context [which is an ancestor o r  
descendent  i n  t h e  c o n t e x t  tree], then the q u e s t i o n  is answered as  i f  it had 
mentioned t h e  r e l e v a n t  c o n t e x t .  
There  are i n t e r a c t i o n s  among t h e  d i f f e r e n t  types of questions which 
weren't mentioned ear l ier  for t h e  sake of c l a r i t y .  Sometiaes  a q u e s t i o n  ray 
i n d i c a t e  a n  incorrect assumption about the s a t e  of MYCIN'S knowledge. For 
examole a q u e s t i o n  could a s k  "Whv don't you think that ORGANISM-1 is 
E.coli?" when, i n  fact ,  the system has concluded t h a t  the organism is 
E.coli. To answer t h i s  q u e s t i o n ,  t h e  e x p l a n a t i o n  system would explain how it 
d i d  make such a d e c i s i o n ,  d e s p i t e  t h e  ~ h r a s i n q  o f  the question. Similarlv, 
when asked how t h e  system used (o r  concluded about)  some mrameter t h a t  was 
never traced, the system e x p l a i n s  why it d i d n  't need t o  f i n d  out about t h e  
parameter ,  reflardless of how t h e  question was bhrased.  
** DID RULE 116 TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT INFECTION-I? 
~ulell6 would be relevant to the primary-bacteremia when applied 
t :  ORGANISM-1 
Clause 5 of rulel 16 ["the infection is m e n i n q i t i s n ]  was already 
known to be false for ORGANISM-I, so the rule was never t r i e d .  
** HOW WAS RULE. 178 HELPFUL WHEN YOU WERE CONSIDERING ORGANISM-13 
~ule178 would be relevant to ORGARISM-1 when applied to: 
CULTURE-I 
I never had reason t o  try t o  a p p l y  rule178 t o  t h i s  blood c u l t u r e .  
X would have needed to use r u l e 1 7 8  i n  order t o  find out 
whether t h i s  blood culture was taken from a sterile s o u r c e .  
However, I was already certain t h a t  t h i s  blood culture was 
t&ken from a qterile source, 
** WHAT DID RULE 295 TELL YOU ABOUT ORGANISM-I? 
I used rule295 to conclude that the identity of ORGANISM-1 $3 
hemophilus-influenzae. This gave a cumulative c.f. of (25). 
The l a s t  ques t ion  asked before the conclusion w a s  made 
was 36. 
+* WHY DIDN'T YOU USE.RULE112 TO FIND OUT ABOUT ORGANISM-I? 
RULE1 12 was not executed because it would have caused circular 
reasoning when a p p l i e d  to ORGANISM-?. Would you like ta 
see t h e  chain of rules and parameters which makes up t h i s  
circle? 
** YES 
1 wanted to know about the identity of ORGANISM-1 -because I 
try to find out the i d e n t i t v  of the organism for a l l  
current organisms of t h e  p a t i e n t .  
To find out about the i d e n t l t y  of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use 
ruleO21. Before I could use rule021, I needed to know about 
a prior orqanism with p o s s i b l y  the same identity as 
ORGANISM-1 . 
To f i n d  out about a prior organism w i t h  poss ib ly  the same 
i d e n t i t y  as ORGANISM-1, I trred t o  use rule005. Before I 
could use rule005, I needed to know about the aerobicity of 
ORGANISM-1 . 
To firid out about the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use 
rule031 .  Before I could use rule031, I needed to know about 
the category of ORGANISM-1 .  
T o  f i n d  out about the category of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use 
rulel 12. Before I could use rulel 12, I needed to know about 
the i d e n t i t y  of ORGANISM-1 . 
But t h i s  is the unknown parameter I sought o r i g i n a l l y .

3 Conclusions 
C o n s u l t a t i o n  system8 which g i v e  e x p e r t  a d v i c e  i n  some domain form 
one class of a r t i f i c i a l  i n t e l l i g e n c e  programs which can provide  useful 
solut ions t o  real-world ppoblems. The u t i l i t y  of such a system, however, 
depends on its a c c e p t a b i l i t y  t o  human users. One fea ture  which can Increase 
a system's a c c e p t a b i l i t y  is a mechanism whereby the  system can explain or 
j u s t i f y  i t s  a d v i c e .  
The development bf an explanation mechanism f o r  a consultation 
system i s  v e r y  much related t o  the  problems o f  r e p r e s e n t i n g  knowledge and of 
making use of d i f f e r e n t  s o u r c e s  of knowledge, Since t h e  product ion  system 
formalism p r o v i d e s  a unified way t o  r e p r e s e n t  modular pieces of  knowledae, 
the task of d e s i g n i n g  an e x p l a n a t i o n  c a p a b i l i t v  is s i m p l i f i e d  f o r  
production-based consultation systems, The example of MYCIN shows how t h i s  
can be done and i l l u s t r a t e s  further t h a t  a svsterll desiqned for a s ingle  
domain with a small, t e c h n i c a l  vocabulary can give comprehensive answers t o  
a wide range  of q u e g t i o n s  without s o p h i s t i c a t e d  na tu ra l - l anguage  processing.

CBCT court action. Fedgral courts i n  various jur isdict ions have bean almost 
unanimous i n  the i r  in terpre ta t ion  of  the  McFad&n Act disallowing off-premises 
CBCTs. Last August, the U.S. Court of Appeals fo r  the Tenth Circui t ,  ru l ing  
i n  a Colorado case, upheld a lower d i s t r i c t  court judgment t h a t  r ece ip t  of 
deposits by CBCTs v ia la tes  the  McFadden Act. 
The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in a separate case, last 
July upheld a d i s t r i c t  court ruling in  Missouri that the First National Bank 
i n  S t .  Louis must remove CBCTs at two St. Louis County locations. The district 
court said that any one of  the three major services provided by CBCTs consti- 
tuted branch banking, which is limited in Missouri. 
In the cases of  the two petitioning Chicago banks, decided by the Federal Court 
of Appeals in Illinois last May, all functions performed by CBCTs were deemed 
to constitute branch banking, which is forbidden in  11,Jinoi.s. 
However, a Federal District Court in Oklahoma approved all three uses o f  CBCTs, 
finding terminals "only processors ,Iv and as such legal. An appeal of the case 
was mooted when the. state legislature authorized legislation aaactioning the 
use of CBCTs. 
GOVERNhIENT OPERATIONS COMMITTliE CRITICIZESNONCOMPETITIVljG PROCUREMENTS 
Following hekrings last June (Washinqton R e ~ m t ,  8/76), the House Cornittee on 
Government Operations stated i n  October that "the low level of fully competitive 
ADP promrements, coupled with the apparent lack of effective utilization of 
ADP resources will, if allowed to  continue, ultimately result in seriously 
jeopardizing the effectiveness of the Brooks Act [P.L. 89-3061, at a cost of 
millions of dollars annually to the taxpayers." 
Reexam.inution of 'true -ct of computere ' suggee.ted. In a report, titled 
Administration of P. L. 89-306, Procwernnt of ADP Re8omes By ths FedemZ 
Covement (II,), the Committee said: "If'the full benefits of the'Act are to be 
achieved, GSA, OMB, NBS, and the user agencies must join together i n  a commit- 
ment t b  ful ly  support and adhere to the provisions of the Act." 
The report suggested a reexamination sf "the true impact of computers on govern- 
ment operations." It raised the question of whether "acquisition of ADP 
resources is necessary to carry on an essential program, or whether such 
acquisition will foster non-essential activity because the computer is available." 
ADP ~ t .  . . receive a t t e n t h  of top management. The Committee concluded 
that ADP Itcam no longer be viewed as a mere tool, but must now be treated in the 
same way as other major programs and, as such, receive top attention of  top 
management." The report attributed the basic causes of noncompetitive procure- 
ments to a lack of: (1) adequate justifications for ADP acquisition; (2) 
long-range planning; (3) standards ; (4) high level languages ; (5) utilization 
~euiews; and (6) use of functional specifications. 
OMB directs GSA to use vfbwtiomZ ADP specifiwtions*. Responding directly t o  
the Committee report and other criticisms, OMB Dlrector James T. L 
letter last month to GSA Administrator Jack ECkerd, wrote that "[t $a o preclude in a 
the adverse effects of unduly restrictive specifications, agsncies shall, t o  
the maximum practical exrent, express their ADP requirements in terms of 
functional performance specifications rather than equipment specifications . " 
Lynn added: "GSA should strive for expeditious review of agency submission 
to avoid delays in the procurement process. Agencies should cooperate with 
GSA to  expedite these reviews. An undue length of time for the normal ADP 
procurement process may be considered a disagreement by GSA with the request 
of the agency, and may be appealed t o  the Office of Management and Budget. 
fvConsistent with the poliw expressed herein, any such appeal will be handled 
expeditiously, but the burden w i l l  be upon the agency t o  demonstrate the need 
to specify the particular make or model of equipment or its functional 
equivalent when such specification i s  at issue," he said. The GSA has 60 
days f i -  October 6 ,  the date of thb letter, to comply with the directive. 
HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS SUBCOWITTGE CHAIRMAN RECOMMENDS OVERHAUL OF 1934 
COM~UNICATIONS ACT 
A "basement - to-at t icl' overhaul of the 1834 Federa2 Commmications Act, the 
statute which provides the basis for regulation of  the nation's telecomuni- 
cations systems, was proposed t o  the next Congress last month by Rep. Lionel 
V a  Deerlin (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Communications Subcommittee. 
The Submcomittee has just completed three day* of hearings on the proposed 
Cone~wr  Comnications R e f o n  Act of 19F6 (Waehh-gton Report, lo/ 76) . 
Joined by Rep. Lou Erey.@-Fla.), Van Deerlin said the original Act is out- 
dated. 
According to the trade press, issues to  be considered by the Subcommittee 
include : whether the FCC has established fair coppetiti:~.: ground rules; 
whether business telephone services really subsidize residential services; 
and what the implications of changing FCC policies are toward competition. 
NEW TAX ACT REPEALS PART OF 1974 PRIVACY ACT ON STATE USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY

pemktting state governments to demand and retain an individual's Social 
Security Number [SSN) to a id  i n  searches for parents not supporting their 
children. The amendment repeals part of the Acivacy Act of 1974. 
In addition, state and local governments can now use the SSN as an identifier 
for tax administrative programs, for drivers ' licenses, and for motor vehicle 
registration. However, government officials who disclose the nmber without 
authorization are subject to  a f i n e  o!f up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS, FHLBB APPEAL RULING PROHIBITING DP SERVICE OFFERINGS 
BY BANKS 
Federal Home Loan Banks i n  Cincinnati, New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and 
Des Moines have joined Washington's Federal Home Loan Rank Board (FHLBB) t o  
appeal a September ru l ing  by a Federal Dis t r i c t  Court Judge i n  Cincinnati 
t h a t  Federal Home Loan Banks can not provide computer services t o  savings 
and loan associations.  Five of the 12 regional Home Loan Banks, which a re  
o r  a t  one time have been suppliers of data processing services,  are involved 
in the Cincinnati appeal. 
ADAPSO, United Data Procesahg obtain irr;junct;on. The original  case was 
brought against t h e  FHLBB and a Cincinnati Home Loan Bank by t h e  Association 
of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO) and United Data Processing, 
Inc, In October, 1973. The remaining four Home Loan Banks joined the s u i t  as 
intervenors i n  November, 1973. The d i s t r i c t  court rul ing enjoined a l l  f ive 
banks from offer ing data  processing services beginning January 1, 1977. A 
modified s tay of t h e  injunction has been obtained by the FHLBB pending the 
present appeal. 
District court bZds  that F e h Z  Rome Loan Banks aro not permitted t o  provide 
D In the o r ig ina l  s u i t ,  ADAPSO argued tha t  the  Federal Home Loan Banks 
posed "a form of unfa i r  competition1' t o  pr iva te  enterprise because they are  
exempted from taxat  ion. William W. Fletcher, president of Midwest Advanced 
Computer Services, inc . ,  Warren, Mlcigan, and ADAPSO member, has been quoted 
as saying tha t  hls firm can not compete with the Federal Home Loan Banks I 
"30 per cent lower" r a t e s .  In  addition, ADAPSO said tha t  t h e  PederaZ Rome 
Loan Bank Act of 2932 forbids banks from part ic ipat ing In  nonbanking commercial 
a c t i v i t i e s  such as those provided by computer service centers. 
Federal Dis t r i c t  Judge Carl B. Rubin, i n  h i s  ruling last September, held that 
"the providing of data  processing services t o  member ins t i tu t ions  is not an 
express power granted t o  the Federal Home Loan Banks or  Federal Hone Loan Bank 
Board1' by the  FedsmZ Home Loan Bunk Act. ADAPSO Executive Vice-President 
Jerome L. Dreyer has c r i t i c i z e d  the FHLBB fo r  encouraging i t s  members t o  market 
data  processing services t o  t h e  same banks which the FHLBB regulates.  
Further adverse court ruzings eouM proscribe future DP offerings by Home Loan 
Banks. ADAPSO Attorney Herbert E. Marks, who is handling the  FHLBB case, to ld  
AFIPS Phshington Report tha t  the  New York Federal Home Loan Bank has ceased 
offer ing data processing services since the d i s t r i c t  court injunction was 
obtained. Marks noted tha t  fur ther  adverse rul ings against the Home Loan Banks 
could proscribe future data processing offerings by t h e  seven other Federal 
Home Loan Banks. He a l so  said that  i f  the d i s t r i c t  court i s  upheld by the 
appeals court in Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board could appeal to 
the Supreme Court. 
A spokeswoman for the FHLBB in Washington told AFIPS that the FHLBB had no 
comment on the case since it is in litigation. She stated that the New York 
Federal Home Loan Bank ceased providing data processing services prior to the 
district court ruling, not after the injunction, as Marks contended. 
NEW CBCT REGULATIONS MAY SANCTION OPERATION OF ,NON-FEDERALLY REGUtATED EFTS 
TERMINALS 
Acting Comptroller of the Currency Robert Bloom last month announced new 
customer-bank comntunicat ions t erkninal (CBCT) regulations for national banks. 
The new regulations allow national banks to apply for permission to establish 
CBCTs as branches in states where state-chartered banRs are permitted to 
establish branches. Bloom's action follows the Supreme Court's refusal to 
consider consolidated petitions from two Chicago banks and the Comptroller of 
the Currency seeking review of Federal Appeals Court decisions which equate 
CBCTs with bank branches and forbid CBCTs in non-branching states (Washington 
R 6 p P t ,  11/76]. 
The Comptroller has unsuccessfully argued in the courts that CBCTs are not 
branches, and are not forbidden in states which limit or disallow branching. 
The trade press suggests that the new regulations may sanction the operation 
of non-federally regulated EFTS terminals by retailers, shopping mall operatorsf 
owners of apartment complexes, or operators of transportation terminals. Thus, 
the effect of these regulations may be to extend the present list of EFTS 
ilprovidersff beyond financial institutions, i.e., to include what were formerly 
on13 EFTS users. 
The Comptroller's new regulations state that capitalization required for a 
CBCT branch may now be shared among the participants, thus lowering the cost of 
operating a CBCT, and presumably making CBCTs available to smaller banks with 
less capital (see Washington Report, 11/76). Also, in contrast to the $500 
application fee for a traditional branch, the application fee for a CBCT branch 
is $200. 
In the section of the Acting Comptroller's statement, said to sanction operation 
of non-federally regulated EFTS  terminal^, Bloom held that "any CBCT which is 
not established by a national bank . . . is not a branch of a national bani, 
and not subject to the provisions oftf the applicable section of the federal bank 
regulation, the McFadden Act, which the courts have held forbids CBCTs in non- 
branching states .

FCC COMPUTER COMJNICATIONS PLANNING CONFERENCE: 'NO LOGICAL TECHNICAL BOUNDARY' 
BETWl!EN COMPUTING AND CO~ICATIONS 
Summarizing the technical presentations a t  the  FCC P~unning C'onfermee on 
Comter Colmnurica6~ons Novenber 8-9 in Washington, organized by the AFIPS 
Washington Office, rrr. Vinton G. Cerf of the Information Processing Techniques 
Office, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA] , noted: (1) There is no 
"logical technical boundary'? between computing and communications; (2) Packet 
switching is  having an ttimportant effectw on computer comnmications today, and 
w i l l  have a ftprofound effect" on frequency allocation in  the future; (3) High 
local access costs, international link costs, and user learning costs are 
(Ilimiting" the growth of computer communications services; (4) The prime opportu- 
nities for network costs and tariff improvement lie in the development of new 
facilities for local access and for intercontinental links; and (5) A regulatory 
climate is needed "which encourages innovation, ensures reliable interconnection 
of primary services, and promotes the acquisition of capital for growth.11 
Witey says FCC p02ioy deoisions must be bused on under8tunding of technoZogy. 
Opening the conference, FCC Chairman Richard E. Wiley stated his view that a 
computer is a comunications device, not a data processing device, when it is used 
in a traditional communications service. However, Wiley also noted that the use 
of computer technology may result in an enhanced service, offering more than 
traditional communications. 
He predicted that Similar technological forces will develop in several areas of 
communications service. Wiley said: "1 firmly believe that, in this grbat free 
enterprise society of ours, government regulations must not be permitted to stand 
in the way of thchnological development. If the new technology creates adminis- 
trative difficulties for the government, it is the regulations that must be 
conformed and not the technology." 
According to the FCC chairman, "We will see more instances in the future where, 
as here, the technology is developing in a manner that blurs traditional inter- 
faces. In cases of this sort, the policymakers mu8t have direct access to 
technical experts and decisions must be based upon an understanding of the 
technology. 
Wiley also said, "It is our belief that AFIPS is a particularly appropriate 
entity to present this conference fur the Commission, in view of the Federation's 
sponsorship of the National Computer Conference, and the Joint Comput el' Conferences 
prior to that. Moreover, it is also our view that AFIPS i s  a basically impartial 
organization in relation to our policy concerns,bringing to us the objective views 
of a group of highly qualified experts .'I 
Computer communieutions aceaunts for 20 per cent of a22 acpenditmes in computgr 
f ie td .  In the conference I s  first presentation on "Computer Communications ; An 
Introduct $on and Overview ," Lynn Hopewell (chairman, IEEE Computer Society 
Technical Committee on Computer Communications ; and senior member, executive staff , 
Coihputer Sciences Corp.] said that computer communications systems had first been 
used in control I i n g ~lcomplexfl operations of industry and government. Hopewell 
added that the most common use of computer commun2cations is in data base applica- 
t ions. 
The speaker suggested that the computer communications industry accounts for 20 
per cent of all expenditures in the computer field, Examples of industrial areas 
affected by computer communications technology were listed as law enforcement, se- 
curities brokerage, insurance, reservations systems and banking. Hopewell said 
that 75 per cent of the top 500 industry corporations are now using camputer 
communications. 
Distributing samples of a microcomputer-on-a-chip , he noted technological changes 
that have produced a 1976 microcomputer CPU costing $20 in contrast to a 1960 IBM 
CPU costing $30,000. Hopewell added that microprocessors which cost $20 today 
cost $100 only a year ago. He indicated that such differentials represent only 
the beginning of extremely low cost computing. 
Hopewell said that the proposed definitions employed in the new "Computer Inquiryff 
aid in qlclarifying the permitted uses of computers by common carriers, but in 
no way allow the proposed abandonment of the 'hybrid1 service concept He 
noted that the hybrid concept should be retained "because some service offerings 
have mixes .ob both computing and communications  function^,^' not because of un- 
clear definitions. 
Since "hybrid services will become even more common in the future," Hopewell 
continued, elimination of the hybrid concept will "ineyitably suppress innovation 
because any services that have communication fact ions  inextricably bound into 
them will be defined as subject to regulation." The speaker concluded that he 
saw no "technological or economic reason for the regulation of the resale industry.?l 
Te~htu,Z~gy $8 'mov;ng t d 8  tntegmted &deband 8 e h e s .  ' In his presentation 
on "Research Topics in Computer Conwnmicati~n ," Vinton G. Cerf summarized 
t ethnological factors influencing the development of computer comhunicat ions, : the 
availability of wideband transmission media; the use of computers to control the 
switching and allocation of transmission bandwidth; the trend towards all-digital 
telephone networks; and interconnection of computer cornmuhications networks. 
Cerf said the "technology is leading away from separate, distinct narrowband 
services . . twoards integrated widenband services. The potential social impact 
is pervasive; the possibilities for new wealth-creating activity, almost incalcu- 
lable; and the need for regulatory adjustment, inevitableeft 
With the juxtaposition of computing and connnunication, he suggested the FCC could:

presentation on the MDimensions of t&e Need for Computer Communications ," Alex 
Cupan, president, BNR, Inc., suggested that domestic users must seek to reduce 
the cost of network access for smaller users, especially in the ltsmaller urban 
centers .'! FCC Interconnection Chief Louis Feldenr , in a question-and-answer 
period following Currants presentation, stressed the Itneed for computer powervf in 
rural areas. 
In his formal presentation, Curran continued that the cost of intercontinental 
transmission must also be reduced. According to the speaker, these measnres 
would help to insure that Ifthe common carrier networks can cope with the data 
communications traffic of commercial users.11 
Curran stated that some of the office and home services associated with computer 
communications could require reintegration of voice and data capabilities. He 
provided several current examples of personal computing including: Vieuduta, the 
embryonic electronic newspaper in the' United Kingdom; Icasthzg, instantaneous 
voting and data collectio~~ in Canada; MzCZgram, a precursor of electronic mail in 
the U. S.; and CAJ, computer-assisted instruction. 
Curran also said that other services will require switching machines "capable 
of recognizing information [interest] specifications as valid addresses For 
example, s w i  thcing machines could recognize selective informat ion dissemination 
interest profiles as valid addresses, he noted. Curran concluded : 'Thus, the boundary

WAS1 IINGTON DEVELOPMENTS 
FEDERAL DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD APPROVED BY COMMERCE DEPARTMENT 
A data encryption algorithm, designed to protect digital information, was 
approved in November ad a Federal .Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 
by the Department of Commerce. The new standard will be described and 
promulgated in FIPS PUB 46. 
The algorithm was first proposed by the Institute for Computer Science 
and Technology (ICST) of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS') in 1973. 
The encrypt ion algorithm converts informat Ion into -an encoded [C. e. , encrypted) 
form which can be transmitted or stored, but which cannot be read without the 
appropriate key. Thus, it can be used to protect inforfiation communicated 
between a terminal and a computer, as well as between computers; in addition, 
it can be used to protect information stored in off-line media. 
Mandatory stundiud for Federa2 agewies .  As a FIPS, Federal agencies wlll 
be requ~red to use the encryption algorithm, whenever encryption of data is 
deemed necessary. However, data subject to the ilu:iona2 Security Act of 1967 
and the Atomic Enenergy Act of 1952 are exempted from the standard. The 
encryption algorithm may also be used on a voluntary basis by organizations 
and individuals outside the Federal government. 
Primary ini t ial  appJication in EFTS. The new standard's primary application 
is, initially expected to be in Electronic Funds Transfer Systems [EFTS). The 
algorithm can be employed in EFTS to discourage l1skinuning" of bank card 
information for the purpose of gaining access to automated te l ler  machines 
(ATMs). It can also be employed to prevent interception of compute1 messages 
authorizing transactions at the ATM. Several non-standard encryption 
algorithms, including one developed by Diebold, Inc,, are already in use by 
some banks. 
Strength ofaZgcwith estimated. NBS said technical workshops have been held 
to measure the strength of the algorithm in terms of time and money that must 
be spent in finding the key. In November, a t  the Dartmouth College Symposim 
on Man and the Computer, ICST Director Dr. Ruth M. Davis stated that, while 
go code is ~theordtically unbreakable," 2,500 years of computer tine on a 
general-purpose computer Ilslgnlficantly faster" than a CDC 7600 would be 
required to derive a key. With respect to future technology, Dr. Davis 
estimated that "working from matched sets of clear and clpher data, well over 
$300 millionH could be spent five years from now to find a key. With technology 
available in 10 years, it could take $70 million t o  derive a key, she said. 
IBM 'e cr~~ori thm choeen; compan%es to manufauture devices $morporatl'ng 
c~ta?t.durd thuut  paying royuztiee. ICST began so l ic i t ing  encryption 
algorithms in 1973 and 1974. IBM's proposed algorithm was chosen in 1975. 
While IBM has patent rights in the standard, the company has .agreed to 
grant royalty-free licenses to other companies which wish to manufacture 
devices incorporating the algorithm. The trade press notes that Motorola 
an& Rockwell ~nternational are planning t o  manufacture integrated cirduit 
chips which incorporate the encryption algorithm. 
Stundcql -too be pubtished 2/I5/77; oonfepeme echeduted. PIPS PUB 46 is. 
expected-to be published February 15, 1977. and to become effective Augrut  
15, 1977. Copies of the standard will be available after February 15 from 
the National Technical Informatibn Service (NTIS),  DOC, 5285 Port Royal Roa& 
Springfield, Virginia 22161, or through the MIPS Washington Office. NBS will 
hold I conference on February 15, 1977, at its Gaithersburg, Maryland, 
facil~tiss to discuss !'IPS PUB 46 in relation t o  other security measures, 
TERMINAL MANUFACTURERS, INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS CRITICIZE FCC APPROVAL OF 
DATASPEED 4014 
Independent terminal manufacturers and industry associations Bast month 
criticized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for its  approval of 
t a r i f f  filrings on AT&Tts Dataspeed 4014 terminal device (Washington Report, 
12/76). me FCC's approval, announced in November, reverses a previous 
proposed decision by the Commission's Common Carrier Buresd. which rejected the 
Dataspeed 40/4 tariff (Washington aeport, 4 / 7 6 ) .  Under the new FCC ruszng, 
ATGT will be permitted to provide the Dataspeed 4014 service. 
Primmy Issue. pe debate centers on whether the terminal bffering const i tu tes  
a data communicat~ons service or a data processing service. If it is a data 
conununications service, a s  held in the present donunission ruling, ATGT can 
provide the service. However, if it is a data processing service, as the Chief 
of the C ~ m o n  Carrier Bureau stated last March, ATET cannot provide the service 
The FCC had held earlier in i t s  original lvCompute]r Inquiry" that common 
carriers may pr(wi.de data processing services, but only through unregulated 
subsidiaries. However, AT&T is  even pre6luded. Zrom this option by its 
agreemept in a 1956 consent decree (with the U.S. Department of Justice) not t o  
participate in unregulated industries. 
Specif ic  industry criticism. The independent terminal manhfacturers and 
computer industry groups charged that the development o f  the Dataspeed 40/4 
terminal is subs id ized  by profi ts  from ATGT's regulated communications service 
offerings. Thus, they contend that the device represents "unfairff competition 
by ATGT against unregulatedb industries. 
Possible further a e t h .  The FCC has stated that its latest ruling is 
contingent on the outcome of the Comrnissionts new 'IComputer Iuquiryvt (see 
Wash6zgtun Report, 8/76). (Comments i n  this proceeding are now due April 11, 
1977; replies are due May 25, 1977.) However, the trade press speculates that 
it is unlikely that the Dataspeed 40/4 offering, once tariffed, w i l l  be 
"detariffedat' 
The Computer and~Communications Industry Association [CCIA) has indicated its 
intention t o  f i l e  suit against the Commission in the U.S. Court of Appeals in 
the District of Columbia. CCIA seeks t o  enjoin implementation of  the FCC's 
ruling, pending a full wurt review on the merits. 
CCPA APPROVES PATENT FOR SOFTWARE PROGRAM SECOND TIME 
Some software programs are eligible for patents, according to the U.S. Court 
of? Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), which l a s t  November reversed %he U.S. 
Patent Office for the second time on the issue of software patentability. 
The CCPA decision involves the  l'Regulatort' program (developed by Glen F. 
Chatfield, pres ident  of Duquesne Systems, Incl), whfch adjus t s  the priorities 
op computer programs. 
In two previous cases, the Supreme Court (prior to the latest Chatf5eZd 
decision)has reversed the CCPA, deciding in  favor of the Patent Office on 
limited grounds and not addressing t h e  question of software patentability. 
In CottschaZk v .  Benson, the Court ruled four years ago 'that a program to 
convert binary-coded decimal was not a patentable llprocessh as defined in tt ie 
U.S.  Code, In 'Dann, ComrnissZoner of Patenes a d  Truemarks v .  Johnston, the 
C m r t  held last April (WashCngton Repor t ,  5/76) that a computerized record- 
keeping system, developed for banks by Thomas R. Johnston, is ltotnrious to one 
reasonably s k i l l e d  in [the applicable] art, and is therefore not patentable. 
CCPA Chief Jud e Harold T. Markey ruled in the ChatfisZd case that "no prior 
art was cited f by the Patent office] against the appealed claims, and, 
accordingly, [the] invention must be considered to have been new and unobvious." 
The judge also held that' Chatfield's invention meets the U.S. Code requirement 
for t l p r o ~ e ~ ~ ' l  claims. 
TELEPROCESSING SERVICE P R O G W  INITIATED BY GSA, TO HELP REDUCE $10 BILLION 
FEDERAL DATA PROCESSING BUDGET 
The General Services Administration (GSA) in November signed its first two 
teleprocessing services schedule contracts, permitting agencies to  order 
services at government-wide volume discounts!, rather than make separate 
procurements at greater cost. The contracts, effective December 1, provide 
for interactive and remote batch proc'essing services &timated at between $50 
to $80 million over the next year. Computer Network C o w .  and First Data Corp. 
rece ived  the first two contracts. 
The trade press suggeststhat the teleprocessing services program is the f i ~ s t  
of several steps the Government is implementing to reduee its $10 billion in 
yearly expenditures on data processing. For example, the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB], Executive Office of the President,is encouraging greater use 
of outside service bureaus as well as third-party leasing firms. In addition, 
each Federal agency has been d i r e c t e d  by OMB to determine five operations now 
being performed on its own computers that could be performed on service bureau 
computers. 
OMB i s  expected to continue ~ t s  moves to cut DP expenses through the 
transition t~ the Carter Administration. 
@lNSUMER BENEFITS IF EFT TERMINALS ARE NOT CONSIQERED BRANCHES: NCEFT 
TELLS SENATq 
Members of the National Commission on Electronic Fund Transfers [NCEFT) last 
month told a Senate Subcornittee that the Arner1ea.n consumer "may suffer 
unnecessary inconveniences and may pay higher prices for payment services" 
if EFT terminals are governed by the saw, laws and regulations that apply to 
bank branches. Such Federal laws equate EFT terminal's wiTh branches thus 
forbidding EFT terminals in non-brandring states. [See Wash5ngton Repop** 
12/76.) 
In testimony presented to the Subcommittee on Financial Iristitutions, chaired 
by Sen. Thomas d .  McIntyre (D-N.H.), NCBFT Chairman William B. Widnall and 
Executive Director John 0. Benton agreed that "[tlhe greatest current impediment 
t o  putting into place the technology which can provide the benefits of EFT to 
the consumer is the uncertainty which exists about the legal environment within 
wllich EFT systems will operate in the future." The chairman and executive 
director, joined by three NCEFT commissioners, said that a competitive 
imbalance is created when federally-chartered savings institutions have greater 
freedom in deploying EFT terminals than national bahks,which are governed by 
more restrictive legislation. The NCEFT representatives+ added that business 
enterprises, such as retail chains, "should not be considered , , . regulated 
institutions or branches thereof," when they employ electronic terminals to 
communicate with depository institutions. 
Last month, the NCEFT convened hearings on competition and sharing. The 
Commi$sionfs interim report is due February 23. 
RGD HAMPERED BY LACK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ENTERPRISE: 
- 
"Lack of teamwork between the Government and private enterprise is the number 
one bottleneck in the nation's pursuit of research and development," said 
Dr. Simon Ramo, vice chairman of the board and chairman of TRW, Inc. Speaking 
last November in Washington at the annual f a l l  meeting of the National Academy 
of Engineering, Dr. Ramo added, "Even the nation's most capable researchers 
spend much of their time defending their selection of projects and describing 
potential results, rather than in carrying on research. We are persisting in 
this tendency even with growing indications that the U.S. is losing its leader- 
ship position as to the fraction of gross national product being devoted to basic 
research." The TRW Executive, who is also chairman of the President * s  Science 
and Technology Committee,expressed the hope that the new Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, will contribute to the 
formation of llsoundlt national policy. 
ASST. COMMERCE SECKETARY RECOMMENDS USPS COMPROMISE ON-PAGE CHARGES FOR NON- 
PROFIT SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNICAL JOURNALS AND PERIODICALS 
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is ItwillSng to modify1' the USPS regulation 
requiring reading matter in all non-profit, second class publications to  be 
marked ~ladvertisementv when contributors are required to pay page charges on 
their submissions, Dr .  Betsy Ancker-Johnson, the Department of Commercets 
Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology, last month said the USPS is 
l lwill ing to modify the regulation so long as contributions to publishing costs 
arenlt mandatary but vol~ntary.~' 
Convening a meeting last month of the Committee on In te l lec tua l  Property and 
Information, Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and 
Technology, Dr. Anclcer- Johnson, committee chairman, indicated that this 
voluntary arrangement should be clarified in the publicationts masthead. 
The regulation could affect the  policy of AFIPS constituent societies which 
must publish a non-profit j ournal as one qualification for membership. 
Page charges, paid by researchers, are viewed by journal publishers as one 
method of defraying the cost of reporting research. In many cases, page 
charges are paid by funds obtained through research grants. Charges may be 
voluntary,far example, with researchers who are not supported by grants. 
Dr. Bernard Forscher, managing editor of the National Academy of Sciences' 
Prooasdhgs, suggested in an interview with AFlPS Washington Report, that page 
charges should be considered i n  research budgets. D r .  Forscher compared publi- 
cation of research findings with "staking a claim t o  a d i s c ~ v e r y , ~ ~  o r  "obtaining 
a deed." Forty per cent of the production costs of the ProoeedjnSs are defrayed 
through page charges; the remaining 60 per cent is covered by sales of 
subscriptions as well as repr in ts  and back issues, he said. 
The meeting of the Committee on In te l lec tua l  Property and- Information was 
attended by rep~esentatives of IEEE, the  National Science Foundation, the 
American Astronomical Society, as well as AFIPS and others.  A representative 
of the Federation of American Societ ies i n  Experimental Biology said  that the 
s c i e n t i f i c  community,will not accept the compromise solution. He indicated that 
unless page charges ire mandatory, they "won1 t work. The biology society's 
representative recommended a special exemption from the regulation f o r  s c i e n t i f i c  
j ournails . 
The counsel for the National Academy o f  Sciences agreed that pa e charges cannot 
be voluntary. He said "those who now pay must contlnue [to pay f or serious 
problems [ w i l l  arise]." He stated that scientific j o u q a l  ar t i c l e s  are Itas 
deserving of second-class [mailing privileges] as anything tha t  goes through the  
mail, " 
There was, however, somq support for the USPS compromise. One society repre- 
sentative suggested that attendance a t  the meeting, re f lec t ing  opposition t o  
the voluntary page charges, was not representative of most professional socie t ies  
views. 
Ancker-Johnson stated that her committee could tlmonitorlf cases brought to its 
attention and ac t  as "brokersv in situations in which voluntary payments, once 
agreed to, werenot made. She confirmed t h a t  the compromise is about t o  be put 
i n  writing (#I by USPS counsel. 
Ancker-Johnson suggested that further comments concerning the  regulation and 
the  proposed compromise be directed t o  her i n  Room 3862, DOC. 14th Street 
between Constitution Avenue and E Street, N.W. Washington, DCmZO23O; telephone

AFIPS PANEL MEMBERS COMMENT ON USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AT REQUEST OF 
. 
PRIVACY COMMISSION: ADDITIONAL RESPONSES DESCRIBED 
Last month. AFIPS Washington Report described responses of some members of 
an AFIPS panel on private sector usage of the Social Security Number (SSN) 
to a position paper on this subject issued by the Privacy Protection Study 
Commission. We now report several additional responses which have since been 
received from: Jeffrey V. White, president, The Credit Bureau, Inc. (CBI), 
Atlanta, Georgia; John J. Stiqlemeier, director, Information Center on 
Education, New York State Emucation Department; Alden R .  Dalzell, director 
of Data Processing, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio; J.M. Moore, section head, 
Exxon Corp., Florham Park, New Jersey; and William E .  Perry, director of EDP 
and Research, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Orlando, Florida. 
Credit Bureau President White wrote: "Since one of CBI's primary obligations 
is to maintain the confidentiality of the informatibn in its data base, we 
would be opposed to any general prohibitions against the use of the Social 
Security Number in the private sector. While CBI does not use this number as 
a universal identif ier or as a sole factor in the identification or authenti- 
cation process, it is an aid in maintaining confidentiality in a small number 
of cases. Therefore, eliminating the use of the Social Security Number would 
have an adverse impact on our ability to serve the consumer and the credit 
granting community. 
Bxxon Section Head Moore wrote:  he presence of the SSN in the record 
constitutes unique identification and restricting its use as a formal record 
identifier would serve no useful purpose," Ohio University Data Processing 
Director Dalzell said: "I would question whether the individual's knowledge 
and consent should be s complete qualifier. Ark individual may be informed 
that he need not supply information i f  he does not wish, and he may be in- 
formed of how it will be used, but that does not completely answer the 
question of whether the information should he gathered and used, even with 
h i s  permission ." 
New York State Education Department Director Stiglemeier wrote that the 
Commission's position paper constituted an "excellentn outline of the project 
boundaries and issues, but the paper's introduction omitted discussion of 
"goals. infomation needs, and inte~relationships with other pro j ects . He 
called these omissions "criticalv1 t o  the success of the project. 
IIA EDP/Research Director Perry ci ted example's of what he called vlsome 
preconceived findings and conclusion sf^ of theposition paper, described by the 
Commission as av@oblem and issue ~tatement.~~ He mentioned such Commission 
flfindingss" as "the use of the SSN for personal authentication does not appear 
in itself t o  constitute an unfair information practice," and Ifthe exchange of 
information without the knowledge or consent of an individual may constitute 
an unfair information practice.ll Perry also wrote that individuals who fee l  
that divulging the SSN f o r  personal authentication is dehumanizing "would 
probably object t o  the alternatives even moreaVr
