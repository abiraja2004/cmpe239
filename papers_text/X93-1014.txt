1. BACKGROUND 
The data selection and data preparation efforts which 
led to the TIPSTER and Fifth Message Understanding Con- 
ference (MUC-5) corpora involved substantial effort, time 
and resources. The Government commitment to these 
selection and preparation efforts stems from four TIPSTER 
Program objectives: (1) to provide training 4ata that would 
promote the development of information extraction tech- 
nology, (2) to provide accurate test data to evaluate and 
baseline system performance inan objective manner, (3) to 
provide baseline data for human performance tounderstand 
and interpret machine performance, and (4) to support he 
larger Natural Language Processing community by making 
available a unique set of texts and templates in multiple 
domains and languages under ARPA support. This commit- 
ment was demonstrated through the managerial, technical, 
and administrative support o these efforts from various 
Government agencies, as well as through the contractual 
efforts with the Institute for Defense Analyses for data 
preparation and New Mexico State University for software 
tool development. 
2. DOCUMENT CORPORA 
Four language-domain pairs were used in the TIP- 
STER exercise, abbreviated as EJV, JJV, EME, JME to 
reflect he language (English or Japanese) and the domain 
(Joint Ventures or MicroElectronics). Each of the four lan- 
guage-domain pairs has an associated set of 1200 to 1600 
documents (a corpus), divided into a development set and 
the multiple test sets. During the course of the TIPSTER 
program, up to three test sets were prepared for each lan- 
guage-domain pair, in addition to approximately 1000 
development set documents for each corpus. These test 
sets, which were used for the TIPSTER 12-, 18-, and 24- 
month evaluations, ranged from 50 to 300 documents each. 
For MUC-5, the first test set was added tothe development 
corpus, the second test set was used for the MUC-5 dry run, 
and the third test set was used for the MUC-5 evaluation. 
Randomly selected from the overall pool of documents, the 
test sets reflect a similar distribution of sources, relevancy, 
and other document attributes as the development sets. 
There are a few exceptions, e.g., the first EJV test set does 
not contain documents from one of the sources added to the 
development and subsequent test sets. 
These corpora consist of documents from a variety of 
newswire or newspaper sources, selected by a combination 
of automatic retrieval and manual filtering techniques. For 
example, the EJV corpus was retrieved from three text data 
sources (LEXUS/NEXUS, PROMT, and Wall Street Jour- 
nal from ACL/DCI or TIPSTER Detection database 
CDROMs) by using traditional keyword-based document 
retrieval systems. These keywords for EJV included such 
sterns as joint venture, joint, venture, tie-up, collaborate, 
cooperate. Though the majority of the documents were 
pulled by the keyword method, additional candidates were 
retrieved by random browsing through the corpora sources 
and identifying documents which appeared to be relevant. 
After a large pool of candidate documents was retrieved, 
these documents were manually scanned and separated into 
two groups: relevant or irrelevant. In order to test whether 
the Information Extraction systems were able to discrimi- 
nate between relevant and irrelevant documents, the four 
corpora were then seeded with a certain number of irrele- 
vant documents. The percentage of irrelevant documents 
functioning as "distractors" ranges from about 5% (for 
English Joint Ventures) to 30% (for Japanese Microelec- 
tronics). By comparison, the corpora used for previous 
MUCs used up to 50% irrelevant documents, tressing the 
document detection aspect of the task more strenuously 
than in TIPSTER/MUC-5. 
The 200+ different sources used to build the English- 
language corpora include the Wall Street Journal, Jiji 
Press, New York Iimes, Financial imes, Kyodo News Ser- 
vice, and a variety of technical publications in fields such 
as communications, airline transportation, rubber & plas- 
tics, and food marketing. The Japanese-language sources

Table 1: Template Counts 
used for the Japanese corpora include Asahi, Nikkei, and 
Yomiuri. 
Each document in the four development corpora has 
an associated filled-in template (see appendices to "Tasks, 
Domains and Languages for Information Extraction" in this 
volume), representing the correct template or "answer key" 
for that document. The development corpora along with 
their associated templates were provided to the program 
participants during the course of the program. 
3. TEMPLATE CORPORA 
In order to provide the system developers with train- 
ing data to illustrate the task and benchmark their develop 
ment, filled-out templates for the approximately 1000 
documents of each training set were provided as "keys". In 
addition, templates were produced for the initial TIPSTER 
program test cycles (12 and 18 months) and for the final 
joint TIPSTER (24 month)/MUC-5 test. Table 1 provides 
the number of templates in each development and test set 
The templates were filled by experienced human ana- 
lysts according to the same fill rules document (see below) 
and other supporting documentation that was provided to 
the system developers to define the exact syntax and 
semantics of the template fills. 
4. FILL RULES 
In addition to the template definition itself, which only 
defines the syntax in a BNF-like notation (see "Template 
Design for Information Extraction" in this volume), the 
analysts and participants in TIPSTER and MUC-5 were 
provided with fill rules for each domain. At the highest 
level, the fill rules specify the reporting conditions for a 
given domain; that is, what information in the document is 
to be extracted and coded as part of the template. These 
reporting conditions correspond to the general goals of the 
extraction task. For example, the fill rules document for the 
JV domain defines what information in a text constitutes 
sufficient evidence to report a joint venture. Of note is that 
the conditions enumerated in the fill rules were determined 
from the document corpus and refined through the actual 
application of (earlier versions of) the fill rules to the cor- 
pus. At a more specific level, the fill rules delineate the con- 
ditions for instantiating an object, object by object, and for 
filling a slot, slot by slot. At the object and dot levels, the 
rules specify (1) what kind of evidence in the text is 
required for instantiation or fills and what, if anything, can 
be inferred, (2) the formatting conditions for data represen- 
tation, and (3) the semantics of the data elements. Examples 
are often provided to highlight any one of these aspects. 
The fill rules served as guidelines for two very differ- 
ent sets of users--the analysts and the system developers. 
Since the evolution of a Fill Rule document was driven to a 
large extent by its application to a text corpus, the analysts 
were key contributors to the fill rules in that they applied the 
rules and in so doing identified discrepancies, omissions, 
and exceptions to the rules. System developers, on the other 
hand, were mainly "consumers" of the rules, even though 
the TIPSTER participants did provide substantial input to 
the fill rules through questions and comments. Although 
reporting conditions as well as object and slot specifications 
need to be implemented in the extraction systems, the 
developers of those systems also relied on the text corpus 
itself and analyst-filled templates to direct development. 
In support of the fill rules document, other specialized 
documents were also provided, for example, expanding on 
the definition of a joint venture, or on the semantics of rep- 
resenting time expressions. programs, and the test sets were used to measure system 
wrformance at six-month intervals (see above under TEM- 
5. OTHER SUPPORTING MATERIAL 
The Government also supplied on-line supporting 
materials to the analysts and the TIPSTERIMUC-5 partici- 
pants. In many cases, this material was used to regularize or 
normalize the template fills. For example, it was necessary 
to use the English language Gazetteer to regularize geo- 
graphic locations. Compiled from a variety of sources, this 
resource provides place names for more than 240,000 loca- 
tions around the world. For example, Baltimore is identified 
as a CITY, located in the PROVINCE (state) of Maryland, 
which is in the COUNTRY USA. The entire gazetteer entry 
for a location is used as the normalized fill for locational 
information in the template. Due to the small number of on- 
line geographic resources available for Japanese, a much 
more limited version of a Japanese gazetteer was manually 
produced by one of the Japanese analysts, with entries for 
all of the countries in the world, detailed listings for Japa- 
nese provinces, U. S. states, major cities for both countries, 
and other major cities worldwide that appeared in the JJV 
corpus. The Japanese language Gazetteer contains 1882 dif- 
ferent locations. 
In the Joint Venture domain, the reporting of the prod- 
ucts or business of the joint venture included classifying the 
product or service using the Standard Industrial Classifica- 
tion Manual compiled by the U. S. Office of Management 
and Budget. This resource contains a hierarchical classifica- 
tion of all the industry or business types in the U. S., for 
example, avocado farms, electric popcorn popper sales, 
management consulting. The template-filling task required 
that products or services be coded as a two-digit classifica- 
tion representing the second level in the hierarchy. 
Other supporting resources for fill regularization 
include lists of currency names and abbreviations (e.g., the 
Dutch guilder is abbreviated NLG), lists of corporate abbre- 
viations (e.g., Inc, GMBH, and Ltd.) along with lists of 
countries where those abbreviations are typically used, and 
nationality adjectives (e.g., Iraqi, Irish). An additional set of 
resources was provided to system developers to assist in the 
extraction task, for example, lists of people's first names. 
All of these resources have been made available to the 
research community through the Consortium for Lexical 
Research at New Mexico State University. 
6. DATA PREPARATION 
The goal of data preparation was to have human ana- 
lysts produce sets of development and test templates for 
each of the four corpora. The development templates served 
as models for system developers in the TIPSTER and MUC 
PLATE CORPORA). For each of the four languageldomain 
pairs, a group of experienced analysts was hired. These ana- 
lysts met regularly over the course of 12 - 21 months 
(depending on the domain) to discuss domain and language- 
specific issues, iron out differences, and provide input to the 
fill rules, which evolved over time. The human analysts 
used a window-based tool for Sun Microsystems worksta-. 
tions, developed for the template-filling task by New Mex- 
ico State University's Computing Research Laboratory. One 
additional sub-task undertaken as part of the data prepara- 
tion was the establishment of a performance baseline by 
measuring the performance of human analysts against each 
other and against the final "correct" version of various tem- 
plates (see Table 2 below; for more &tail, see also "Com- 
paring Human and Machine Performance for Natural 
Language Information Extraction: Results from the Tipster 
Text Evaluation" in this volume). 
Eleven of the nineteen analysts which comprised the 
four teams were hied by the Institute for Defense Analyses 
(IDA) in Virginia; additional analysts from various Govern- 
ment facilities joined these teams. The Government techni- 
cal management team (including the authors) led the effort 
to specify the domain, the definition of the templates, and 
the development of fill rulesfill rules and other supporting 
materials, in addition to directing IDA, which was responsi- 
ble for tracking template production and delivering pre- 
pared materials to the contractor sites, among other tasks. 
In order to ensure maximal consistency and correct- 
ness in the analyst-produced keys, a variety of template-fill- 
ing schemes were tried. Essentially, the schemes used 
different degrees of redundancy in producing each filled 
template, then used different methods to compare those 
template versions and to produce one final "most correct" 
version. Table 2 summarizes the different strategies that 
were tried. Most templates were produced using AB+B or 
AB+C; JME was entirely produced using A+A. For the 
other three corpora, the A, B, C, and D positions were 
rotated among the analysts. Even though redundant coding 
and checking methods were utilized, the templates that were 
produced were not perfect; anomalies found by system 
developers were reviewed and changes were incorporated 
into the templates as appropriate. 
7. TEMPLATE-FILLING STRATEGIES 
The methodology used by the human analysts in fill- 
ing templates was studied during the course of the task, 
partly to drive redesign of the tools and documentation to 
support the analysts' efforts. Although available resources 
did not permit extensive cognitive study of the mechanisms

Each of four analysts produces coding

used by analysts, we did make some general observations 
about he strategies used by analysts. 
A variety of approaches were used by the human ana- 
lysts in filling out the templates. What follows is a charac- 
terization of the different strategies used by the five 
Japanese joint venture analysts (referred to as Analysts A, 
B, C, D and E) in analyzing the documents and filling out 
the corresponding templates. 
The analysts' task can be divided into two parts: a 
start-up procedure and the actual template filling process, 
using the on-line tool. The start-up rocedure includes both 
reading the text, and annotating a hard copy of the docu- 
ment. The template-filling process addresses the order in 
which the analysts actually filled out the objects and slots 
that represented the various pieces of information to be 
extracted from the text. 
For the start-up procedure, three distinct approaches 
were identified. Scheme 1, used by two analysts, is charac- 
terized by minimal marking of the hard-copy text before 
starting to code the template using the on-line tool. Analyst 
B would read the article twice through, then underline and 
label just the tie ups and entities before going to the tool. 
Analyst D would read and simultaneously underline ntities 
and place check marks by other pertinent data; then he 
would begin coding. 
In Scheme 2, also used by two analysts, a more 
detailed annotation of the hard-copy text was made. Analyst 
E would read through the hard-copy text and simulta- 
neously underline and number entities, circle and number 
tie ups, and make comments, uch as "El alias," "E2 offi- 
cial" (for alias or official~associated with a particular entity). 
Moreover, this analyst would draw links between related 
pieces of information in the text, and would outline in the 
138 
margins more complex objects, such as ACTIVITY, OWN- 
ERSHIP, and REVENUE. After this process was complete, 
the coding would begin. Analyst C's approach was simi- 
larly detailed, the only difference being that she would label 
all pertinent information using color-coded highlighters, 
e.g., green for ENTITYS, yellow for product/service 
strings, blue for FACILITY and TIME objects. 
The thkd scheme, used only by Analyst A, involved a
mixture of initial marking, skimming, initial coding, anno- 
tating in detail, and then final coding. This analyst would 
read the beginning of the article, marking potential entities 
until a "tie-up verb" was found. Now certain that he article 
had a valid tie up, she would proceed to skim the remainder 
of the text, underlining or circling additional pertinent 
information. At this point, she would use the tool to code 
the initial portion of the template, i.e., the TIE-UPs, 
ENTITYs, and ENTITY-RELATIONSHIPS. After this key 
structure was in place, she would read through the remain- 
der of the text, annotating indetail all potential product/ser- 
vice strings and information about FACILITYs, 
REVENUE, OWNERSHIP, etc. Finally, the remainder of the 
template was coded using the tool. 
In the templateTfilling process, avariety of breadth vs. 
depth-first trategies were used by the analysts. Four of the 
analysts would completely fill in all information about he 
first tie up before coding any additional tie ups. Analysts A, 
B, and E would fill in the TEMPLATE, TIE-UP, ENTITY, 
and ENT ITY-RELAT IONSHIP  objects first. Then TIME, 
REVENUE, OWNERSHIP, PERSON and FACIL ITY  
objects were instantiated in no particular order. The 
ACTIVITY and INDUSTRY objects were filled in concur- 
rently, usually last. This procedure was then repeated for 
additional tie ups. Analyst D followed a complete depth- 
first strategy for coding each tie up, filling in each slot in 
turn, so that if a slot pointed to another object, that object 
would then be filled in completely before proceeding to the 
next slot in the top level object. A breadth-first rategy for 
coding was used by Analyst C, who would fill in all tie-up 
objects and their respective entities first, and then code the 
remaining information for each tie up. 
These varying strategies for annotating texts and cod- 
ing templates did not seem to have a significant effect on 
the quality of the templates produced, and seemed to be a 
matter of personal preference. However, they give insight 
into the different ways in which humans approach a particu- 
lar analytic task, and suggest hat on-line analytic tools 
need to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the styles of 
different human users.
