Abstract 
Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts be-
have quite differently from normal written 
texts and have some very special phenom-
ena. To translate SMS texts, traditional 
approaches model such irregularities di-
rectly in Machine Translation (MT). How-
ever, such approaches suffer from 
customization problem as tremendous ef-
fort is required to adapt the language 
model of the existing translation system to 
handle SMS text style. We offer an alter-
native approach to resolve such irregulari-
ties by normalizing SMS texts before MT. 
In this paper, we view the task of SMS 
normalization as a translation problem 
from the SMS language to the English 
language 1  and we propose to adapt a 
phrase-based statistical MT model for the 
task. Evaluation by 5-fold cross validation 
on a parallel SMS normalized corpus of 
5000 sentences shows that our method can 
achieve 0.80702 in BLEU score against 
the baseline BLEU score 0.6958. Another 
experiment of translating SMS texts from 
English to Chinese on a separate SMS text 
corpus shows that, using SMS normaliza-
tion as MT preprocessing can largely 
boost SMS translation performance from 
0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score. 
1 Motivation 
SMS translation is a mobile Machine Translation 
(MT) application that translates a message from 
one language to another. Though there exists 
many commercial MT systems, direct use of 
such systems fails to work well due to the special 
phenomena in SMS texts, e.g. the unique relaxed 
and creative writing style and the frequent use of 
unconventional and not yet standardized short-
forms. Direct modeling of these special phenom-
ena in MT requires tremendous effort. Alterna-
tively, we can normalize SMS texts into

grammatical texts before MT.  In this way, the 
traditional MT is treated as a ?black-box? with 
little or minimal adaptation. One advantage of 
this pre-translation normalization is that the di-
versity in different user groups and domains can 
be modeled separately without accessing and 
adapting the language model of the MT system 
for each SMS application. Another advantage is 
that the normalization module can be easily util-
ized by other applications, such as SMS to 
voicemail and SMS-based information query. 
In this paper, we present a phrase-based statis-
tical model for SMS text normalization. The 
normalization is visualized as a translation prob-
lem where messages in the SMS language are to 
be translated to normal English using a similar 
phrase-based statistical MT method (Koehn et al, 
2003). We use IBM?s BLEU score (Papineni et 
al., 2002) to measure the performance of SMS 
text normalization. BLEU score computes the 
similarity between two sentences using n-gram 
statistics, which is widely-used in MT evalua-
tion. A set of parallel SMS messages, consisting 
of 5000 raw (un-normalized) SMS messages and 
their manually normalized references, is con-
structed for training and testing. Evaluation by 5-
fold cross validation on this corpus shows that 
our method can achieve accuracy of 0.80702 in 
BLEU score compared to the baseline system of 
0.6985. We also study the impact of our SMS 
text normalization on the task of SMS transla-
tion. The experiment of translating SMS texts 
from English to Chinese on a corpus comprising 
402 SMS texts shows that, SMS normalization as 
a preprocessing step of MT can boost the transla-
tion performance from 0.1926 to 0.3770 in 
BLEU score. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 
summarizes the characteristics of English SMS 
texts. Section 4 discusses our method and Sec-
tion 5 reports our experiments. Section 6 con-
cludes the paper. 
2 Related Work 
There is little work reported on SMS normaliza-
tion and translation. Bangalore et al (2002) used 
33
a consensus translation technique to bootstrap 
parallel data using off-the-shelf translation sys-
tems for training a hierarchical statistical transla-
tion model for general domain instant messaging 
used in Internet chat rooms. Their method deals 
with the special phenomena of the instant mes-
saging language (rather than the SMS language) 
in each individual MT system.  Clark (2003) 
proposed to unify the process of tokenization, 
segmentation and spelling correction for nor-
malization of general noisy text (rather than SMS 
or instant messaging texts) based on a noisy 
channel model at the character level. However, 
results of the normalization are not reported. Aw 
et al (2005) gave a brief description on their in-
put pre-processing work for an English-to-
Chinese SMS translation system using a word-
group model. In addition, in most of the com-
mercial SMS translation applications 2 , SMS 
lingo (i.e., SMS short form) dictionary is pro-
vided to replace SMS short-forms with normal 
English words. Most of the systems do not han-
dle OOV (out-of-vocabulary) items and ambigu-
ous inputs. Following compares SMS text 
normalization with other similar or related appli-
cations. 
2.1 SMS Normalization versus General 
Text Normalization 
General text normalization deals with Non-
Standard Words (NSWs) and has been well-
studied in text-to-speech (Sproat et al, 2001) 
while SMS normalization deals with Non-Words 
(NSs) or lingoes and has seldom been studied 
before. NSWs, such as digit sequences, acronyms, 
mixed case words (WinNT, SunOS), abbrevia-
tions and so on, are grammatically correct in lin-
guistics. However lingoes, such as ?b4? (before) 
and ?bf? (boyfriend), which are usually self-
created and only accepted by young SMS users, 
are not yet formalized in linguistics. Therefore, 
the special phenomena in SMS texts impose a 
big challenge to SMS normalization. 
2.2 SMS Normalization versus Spelling 
Correction Problem 
Intuitively, many would regard SMS normaliza-
tion as a spelling correction problem where the 
lingoes are erroneous words or non-words to be 
replaced by English words. Researches on spell-
ing correction centralize on typographic and 
cognitive/orthographic errors (Kukich, 1992) and 
use approaches (M.D. Kernighan, Church and 
                                                          
2 http://www.etranslator.ro and http://www.transl8bit.com 
Gale, 1991) that mostly model the edit operations 
using distance measures (Damerau 1964; Leven-
shtein 1966), specific word set confusions (Gold-
ing and Roth, 1999) and pronunciation modeling 
(Brill and Moore, 2000; Toutanova and Moore, 
2002). These models are mostly character-based 
or string-based without considering the context. 
In addition, the author might not be aware of the 
errors in the word introduced during the edit op-
erations, as most errors are due to mistype of 
characters near to each other on the keyboard or 
homophones, such as ?poor? or ?pour?.  
In SMS, errors are not isolated within word 
and are usually not surrounded by clean context. 
Words are altered deliberately to reflect sender?s 
distinct creation and idiosyncrasies. A character 
can be deleted on purpose, such as ?wat? (what) 
and ?hv? (have).  It also consists of short-forms 
such as ?b4? (before), ?bf? (boyfriend). In addi-
tion, normalizing SMS text might require the 
context to be spanned over more than one lexical 
unit such as ?lemme? (let me), ?ur? (you are) etc. 
Therefore, the models used in spelling correction 
are inadequate for providing a complete solution 
for SMS normalization. 
2.3 SMS Normalization versus Text Para-
phrasing Problem 
Others may regard SMS normalization as a para-
phrasing problem. Broadly speaking, paraphrases 
capture core aspects of variability in language, 
by representing equivalencies between different 
expressions that correspond to the same meaning. 
In most of the recent works (Barzilay and 
McKeown, 2001; Shimohata, 2002), they are 
acquired (semi-) automatically from large com-
parable or parallel corpora using lexical and 
morpho-syntactic information. 
Text paraphrasing works on clean texts in 
which contextual and lexical-syntactic features 
can be extracted and used to find ?approximate 
conceptual equivalence?. In SMS normalization, 
we are dealing with non-words and ?ungram-
matically? sentences with the purpose to normal-
ize or standardize these words and form better 
sentences. The SMS normalization problem is 
thus different from text paraphrasing. On the 
other hand, it bears some similarities with MT as 
we are trying to ?convert? text from one lan-
guage to another. However, it is a simpler prob-
lem as most of the time; we can find the same 
word in both the source and target text, making 
alignment easier.

3 Characteristics of English SMS  
Our corpus consists of 55,000 messages collected 
from two sources, a SMS chat room and corre-
spondences between university students. The 
content is mostly related to football matches, 
making friends and casual conversations on 
?how, what and where about?. We summarize 
the text behaviors into two categories as below. 
3.1 Orthographic Variation 
The most significant orthographic variant in 
SMS texts is in the use of non-standard, self-
created short-forms. Usually, sender takes advan-
tage of phonetic spellings, initial letters or num-
ber homophones to mimic spoken conversation 
or shorten words or phrases (hw vs. homework or 
how, b4 vs. before, cu vs. see you, 2u vs. to you, 
oic vs. oh I see, etc.) in the attempt to minimize 
key strokes. In addition, senders create a new 
form of written representation to express their 
oral utterances. Emotions, such as ?:(? symboliz-
ing  sad, ?:)? symbolizing smiling, ?:()? symbol-
izing shocked, are representations of body 
language. Verbal effects such as ?hehe? for 
laughter and emphatic discourse particles such as 
?lor?, ?lah?, ?meh? for colloquial English are 
prevalent in the text collection. 
The loss of ?alpha-case? information posts an-
other challenge in lexical disambiguation and 
introduces difficulty in identifying sentence 
boundaries, proper nouns, and acronyms. With 
the flexible use of punctuation or not using punc-
tuation at all, translation of SMS messages with-
out prior processing is even more difficult. 
3.2 Grammar Variation 
SMS messages are short, concise and convey 
much information within the limited space quota 
(160 letters for English), thus they tend to be im-
plicit and influenced by pragmatic and situation 
reasons. These inadequacies of language expres-
sion such as deletion of articles and subject pro-
noun, as well as problems in number agreements 
or tenses make SMS normalization more chal-
lenging. Table 1 illustrates some orthographic 
and grammar variations of SMS texts. 
3.3 Corpus Statistics  
We investigate the corpus to assess the feasibility 
of replacing the lingoes with normal English 
words and performing limited adjustment to the 
text structure. Similarly to Aw et al (2005), we 
focus on the three major cases of transformation 
as shown in the corpus: (1) replacement of OOV 
words and non-standard SMS lingoes; (2) re-
moval of slang and (3) insertion of auxiliary or 
copula verb and subject pronoun.

If we include the word ?null? in the English 
vocabulary, the above model can fully address 
the deletion and substitution transformations, but 
inadequate to address the insertion transforma-
tion. For example, the lingoes ?duno?, ?ysnite? 
have to be normalized using an insertion trans-
formation to become ?don?t know? and ?yester-
day night?. Moreover, we also want the 
normalization to have better lexical affinity and 
linguistic equivalent, thus we extend the model 
to allow many words to many words alignment, 
allowing a sequence of SMS words to be normal-
ized to a sequence of contiguous English words. 
We call this updated model a phrase-based nor-
malization model.  
normalization with a total of 2300 transforma-
tions. Substitution accounts for almost 86% of all 
transformations. Deletion and substitution make 
up the rest. Table 3 shows the top 10 most com-
mon transformations. 
4 SMS Normalization  
We view the SMS language as a variant of Eng-
lish language with some derivations in vocabu-
lary and grammar. Therefore, we can treat SMS 
normalization as a MT problem where the SMS 
language is to be translated to normal English. 
We thus propose to adapt the statistical machine 
translation model (Brown et al, 1993; Zens and 
Ney, 2004) for SMS text normalization. In this 
section, we discuss the three components of our 
method: modeling, training and decoding for 
SMS text normalization. 
4.2 Phrase-based Model 
Given an English sentence e  and SMS sentence 
s , if we assume that e  can be decomposed into 
 phrases with a segmentation T , such that 
each phrase e  in  can be corresponded with 
one phrase s  in

rewritten in equation (3).  
4.1 Basic Word-based Model  
The SMS normalization model is based on the 
source channel model (Shannon, 1948). Assum-
ing that an English sentence e, of length N is 
?corrupted? by a noisy channel to produce a 
SMS message s, of length M, the English sen-
tence e, could be recovered through a posteriori 
distribution for a channel target text given the 
source text P s , and a prior distribution for 
the channel source text .

This is the basic function of the channel model 
for the phrase-based SMS normalization model, 
where we used the maximum approximation for 
the sum over all segmentations. Then we further 
decompose the probability 1 1( | )

Assuming that one SMS word is mapped ex-
actly to one English word in the channel model 
 under an alignment , we need to con-
sider only two types of probabilities: the align-
ment probabilities denoted by P m  and the 
lexicon mapping probabilities denoted by 
(Brown et al 1993). The channel 
model can be written as in the following equation

The statistics in our training corpus shows that 
by selecting appropriate phrase segmentation, the 
position re-ordering at the phrase level occurs 
rarely. It is not surprising since most of the Eng-
lish words or phrases in normal English text are 
replaced with lingoes in SMS messages without 
position change to make SMS text short and con-
cise and to retain the meaning. Thus we need to 
consider only monotone alignment at phrase 
level, i.e., k , as in equation (4). In addition, 
the word-level reordering within phrase is 
learned during training. Now we can further de-
rive equation (4) as follows:

The alignment process given in equation (8) is 
different from that of normalization given in

4.3 Training Issues 
For the phrase-based model training, the sen-
tence-aligned SMS corpus needs to be aligned 
first at the phrase level. The maximum likelihood 
approach, through EM algorithm and Viterbi 
search (Dempster et al, 1977) is employed to 
infer such an alignment. Here, we make a rea-
sonable assumption on the alignment unit that a 
single SMS word can be mapped to a sequence 
of contiguous English words, but not vice verse. 
The EM algorithm for phrase alignment is illus-
trated in Figure 1 and is formulated by equation 
(8).

graphic similarities

Since EM may fall into local optimization, in 
order to speed up convergence and find a nearly 
global optimization, a string matching technique 
is exploited at the initialization step to identify 
the most probable normalization pairs. The or-
37
thographic similarities captured by edit distance 
and a SMS lingo dictionary3  which contains the 
commonly used short-forms are first used to es-
tablish phrase mapping boundary candidates. 
Heuristics are then exploited to match tokens 
within the pairs of boundary candidates by trying 
to combine consecutive tokens within the bound-
ary candidates if the numbers of tokens do not 
agree. 
Finally, a filtering process is carried out to 
manually remove the low-frequency noisy 
alignment pairs. Table 4 shows some of the ex-
tracted normalization pairs. As can be seen from 
the table, our algorithm discovers ambiguous 
mappings automatically that are otherwise miss-
ing from most of the lingo dictionary.

Table 4. Examples of normalization pairs 
 
Given the phrase-aligned SMS corpus, the 
lexical mapping model, characterized by 
( | )k kP s e  , is easily to be trained using equation 
(6). Our n-gram LM 1( | )n nP e e ? is trained on 
English Gigaword provided by LDC using 
SRILM language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 
2002). Backoff smoothing (Jelinek, 1991) is used 
to adjust and assign a non-zero probability to the 
unseen words to address data sparseness. 
4.4 Monotone Search  
Given an input , the search, characterized in 
equation (7), is to find a sentence e that maxi-
s
mizes  using the normalization 
model. In this paper, the maximization problem 
in equation (7) is solved using a monotone search, 
implemented as a Viterbi search through dy-
namic programming.

5 Experiments 
The aim of our experiment is to verify the effec-
tiveness of the proposed statistical model for 
SMS normalization and the impact of SMS nor-
malization on MT. 
A set of 5000 parallel SMS messages, which 
consists of raw (un-normalized) SMS messages 
and reference messages manually prepared by 
two project members with inter-normalization 
agreement checked, was prepared for training 
and testing. For evaluation, we use IBM?s BLEU 
score (Papineni et al, 2002) to measure the per-
formance of the SMS normalization. BLEU score 
measures the similarity between two sentences 
using n-gram statistics with a penalty for too

5.1 Baseline Experiments: Simple SMS 
Lingo Dictionary Look-up and Using 
Language Model Only 
The baseline experiment is to moderate the texts 
using a lingo dictionary comprises 142 normali-
zation pairs, which is also used in bootstrapping 
the phrase alignment learning process.  
Table 5 compares the performance of the dif-
ferent setups of the baseline experiments. We 
first measure the complexity of the SMS nor-
malization task by directly computing the simi-
larity between the raw SMS text and the 
normalized English text. The 1st row of Table 5 
reports the similarity as 0.5784 in BLEU score, 
which implies that there are quite a number of 
English word 3-gram that are common in the raw 
and normalized messages. The 2nd experiment is 
carried out using only simple dictionary look-up.

Lexical ambiguity is addressed by selecting the 
highest-frequency normalization candidate, i.e., 
only unigram LM is used. The performance of 
the 2nd experiment is 0.6958 in BLEU score. It 
suggests that the lingo dictionary plus the uni-
gram LM is very useful for SMS normalization. 
Finally we carry out the 3rd experiment using 
dictionary look-up plus bi-gram LM. Only a 
slight improvement of 0.0128 (0.7086-0.6958) is 
obtained. This is largely because the English 
words in the lingo dictionary are mostly high-
frequency and commonly-used. Thus bi-gram 
does not show much more discriminative ability 
than unigram without the help of the phrase-
based lexical mapping model. 
Experimental result analysis reveals that the 
strength of our model is in its ability to disam-
biguate mapping as in ?2? to ?two? or ?to? and 
?w? to ?with? or ?who?. Error analysis shows 
that the challenge of the model lies in the proper 
insertion of subject pronoun and auxiliary or 
copula verb, which serves to give further seman-
tic information about the main verb, however this 
requires significant context understanding. For 
example, a message such as ?u smart? gives little 
clues on whether it should be normalized to ?Are 
you smart?? or ?You are smart.? unless the full 
conversation is studied.

5.2 Using Phrase-based Model 
We then conducted the experiment using the pro-
posed method (Bi-gram LM plus a phrase-based 
lexical mapping model) through a five-fold cross 
validation on the 5000 parallel SMS messages. 
Table 6 shows the results. An average score of 
0.8070 is obtained. Compared with the baseline 
performance in Table 5, the improvement is very 
significant. It suggests that the phrase-based 
lexical mapping model is very useful and our 
method is effective for SMS text normalization. 
Figure 2 is the learning curve. It shows that our 
algorithm converges when training data is 
increased to 3000 SMS parallel messages. This 
suggests that our collected corpus is representa-
tive and enough for training our model. Table 7 
illustrates some examples of the normalization 
results.

5.3 Effect on English-Chinese MT 
An experiment was also conducted to study the 
effect of normalization on MT using 402 mes-
sages randomly selected from the text corpus. 
We compare three types of SMS message: raw 
SMS messages, normalized messages using sim-
ple dictionary look-up and normalized messages 
using our method. The messages are passed to 
two different English-to-Chinese translation sys-
tems provided by Systran4 and Institute for Info-
comm Research5(I2R) separately to produce three 
sets of translation output. The translation quality 
is measured using 3-gram cumulative BLEU 
score against two reference messages. 3-gram is

used as most of the messages are short with aver-
age length of seven words. Table 8 shows the 
details of the BLEU scores. We obtain an aver-
age of 0.3770 BLEU score for normalized mes-
sages against 0.1926 for raw messages. The 
significant performance improvement suggests 
that preprocessing of normalizing SMS text us-
ing our method before MT is an effective way to 
adapt a general MT system to SMS domain.

6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we study the differences among 
SMS normalization, general text normalization, 
spelling check and text paraphrasing, and inves-
tigate the different phenomena of SMS messages. 
We propose a phrase-based statistical method to 
normalize SMS messages. The method produces 
messages that collate well with manually normal-
ized messages, achieving 0.8070 BLEU score 
against 0.6958 baseline score. It also signifi-
cantly improves SMS translation accuracy from 
0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score without adjust-
ing the MT model. 
This experiment results provide us with a good 
indication on the feasibility of using this method 
in performing the normalization task. We plan to 
extend the model to incorporate mechanism to 
handle missing punctuation (which potentially 
affect MT output and are not being taken care at 
the moment),  and making use of pronunciation 
information to handle OOV caused by the use of 
phonetic spelling. A bigger data set will also be 
used to test the robustness of the system leading 
to a more accurate alignment and normalization.
