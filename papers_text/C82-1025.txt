A special programme converting classes of words 
of international usage directly from English to 
Czech is described in its application in an ex- 
periment of machine translation as well as in 
general environments. The words undergo special 
morphemic analysis, they are adapted morphemic- 
ally and orthographical ly to the target langu- 
age form and,in the experimental version, they 
are assigned pertinent grammatical and semantic 
information. 
Dictionary operations in automatic processing of natural lang- 
uage involve, as a rule, a number of problems, most of which being 
connected with the fact that lexicons general ly tend to grow beyond 
tolerable measure. That is also why the ideal but hardly feasible 
principle of l isting in the lexicon only "irregularities" has re- 
tained its methodological  appeal, especially in the automatic analys- 
is of natural language. Various solutions may be found to the prob- 
lem of reducing the size of dictionaries; the one pre~ent~l here may 
be of some interest, because the algorithm described performs the 
task of substituting classes of target language equivalents for 
classes of source language expressions. 
Replacing the source language words by target language equiv- 
alents must be regarded as an operation involving changes "irregular" 
if not by nature with some pairs of languages, then certainly in 
point of fact in actual practice everywhere. Most languages that have 
or are supposed to have had a common ancestor dlffer at the lexical 
level to such an extent that it is impossible to cover the etymolog- 
ical changes by any applicable set of rules, and even if this were 
possible, semantic shift would interfere in an incontrollable way. 
However, the impact of some relatively recent historical changes 
(economic, political and cultural)has led to a specific and partial 
rapprochement of languages: the assimilation of words of foreign 
origin caused by these processes usually happens in conformity with 
standard morphemic and orthographic rules and, since most of the new 
acquisit ions stay beyond the reach of common usage, semantic shift 
is rare. 
On this basis the so-called "translational" or "transducing" 
dictionary (henceforth TD) has been developed in the experiments 
with machine translation carried out in the l inguistic group at the 
faculty of mathematics and physics, Charles University, Prague. This

device converts the words of international usage from their source 
language (English) form into the morphemical ly and orthographical ly 
adapted target language (Czech) counterparts in a three-step proced- 
ure, which involves also the modif ications in the corresponding der- 
ived parts-of-speech, i.e. adjectives derived from nouns, adverbs 
from adjectives, etc. In its present form, the TD covers the classes 
of English nouns ending in CE, CY, EGY, ENT, ER, ERE, GRAM, GRAPH, 
ICS, ID, ISM, ITY, IUM, ODE, OGY, ON, ONY, OPY, OR, ORY, PHONE, PHY, 
SCOPE, SIS, TRY, URE, adjectives in ABLE, IBLE, AL, ARY, IC, IVE, 
OUS, RSE, and verbs in ATE, FY, ZE, and it can be extended as requi- 
red. Most of these classes fall into more subclasses to meet the 
specific requirements based on grammatical, semantic, or, as the case 
may be, orthographic distinctions. The equivalent forms need not 
differ at all, as e.g. in IMPEDANCE <but the adjective derived is 
IMPEDAN~Nf), or they differ very little <DIODE ~ DIODA, GRAPH =GRAF, 
etc.), or differ considerably (OPTIMIZATION = OPTIMALIZACE, INTENS- 
IFIER = INTENZIFIKATOR, DEMONSTRATE = DEMONSTROVAT, ADAPTABLE = 
ADAPTOVATELN~). 
In the overall algorithm, the main dict ionary precedes the TD, 
so that all grammatical ly and/or semantical ly idiosyncratic words 
formally belonging to the classes enumerated above can evade the 
treatment in TD: e.g. ICE, ICY, WENT, SCOPE, or even APPLICATION (a 
noun with partial ly idiomatic properties taken over from the cor- 
responding verbal frame), etc. The forms of words that passed through 
the main dictionary, failed to be identified, and were reconstructed 
again, enter the first step of the TD procedure: a special morphemic 
analysis concerning forms of unrecognized words that are potential 
members of the classes covered by TD. Thus, e.g., the normal form 
ILLUSTRATE,<+ED) is reconstructed from the form ILLUSTRATED, STRATEGY 
(+S) from STRATEGIES (but not OPTIC (+S) from OPTICS, where 
a restriction interferes). Some words undergo special modif icat ions 
in the first step, most ly to be adapted to more frequent usage or to 
more profound changes in the target language (e.g., with both kinds 
of adaptations in one, MINIMISE becomes temporari ly MINIM-ALIZE; 
LOCALIZE, of course, remains unaffected). 
The second step selects the words to be treated and replaces 
the source language suffixes or endings by the corresponding target 
language ones: as examples, three rules can be quoted, the first for 
nouns ending in ITY (permeability, viscosity, thermoelasticity, etc.), 
the second for verbs in ATE (demonstrate, il lustrate, etc.), and the 
third for adjectives in SSIVE <aggressive, passive, massive, etc.). 
The words enter this step desintegrated, as lists of ordered charact- 
ers. In the following rules, a, b are variables for labels - indiv- 
idual Characters or strings of characters - u, v, w variables for 
lists - e.g., one or more characters, labels, etc.; they can be 
empty lists, too. Capital letters and digits constitute constants; 
the double sign ~ or ~ indicates that the following label is des- 
integrated and represents a list of characters. The rest of characters 
used convey grammatical, semantic and/or technical information. The 
conventional signs A ,  =, /, ~ , C have their usual meaning, viz. 
conjunction, equality, non-equality, set- intersection and set-inclus- 
ion, respectively; == means "rewrite as". 
ATOM (u,I,T,Y) == PN (u,I ,T,~(~93V2),~A,*PROP,/,~). 
ATOM (u,A,T,E) == PV (u,U,J ,*(21~2WW5UIX3), I(*A,*H,*C),2(*A,~C,~OB), 
/ ,? ) .  
ATOM (u ,a ,~b)  == PA (u ,a ,~SI2VNI2,~(Y) ,*A,~C,~MNR)/a~S \b~SIVE. 
The third step is closely connected with the second and per- 
forms the necessary orthographic adjustments. E.g., the rule 
ON A DEVICE IN DICTIONARY OPERATIONS 159 
C0(u,?,a,b,v,#,w) == C~(u,a,?,v,#,w)/a=TAb=HVa:b. ' , ({b} 
{c,o,s}):~. 
applied recursively until v equals one single character or is empty, 
changes TH into T; any doubled character (with the exception of C,O,S) 
becomes single. Very similar rules handle the groups PH, QU, etc.; 
e.g., another rule 
C~(u,~,a,b,v,~,w) == C~(u,E,b,~,v,~w)/a=C,N{b}c {A,L,O,R,T,U}. 
&pplied recursively in the same way changes C which immediately prec- 
edes A or L or O or R or T or U into K. There is a set of such rules 
dealing with groups of two or, as the case may be, more characters; 
complementary rules control the movement of the ~ sign in case the 
first character, the second or the following ones do not correspond 
to the condition. To quote the simplest example, the following rule 
moves the ~ sign by one place only in case the first character 
(standing in the posit ion indicated by the variable a) is not T or P 
or Q or C, and the two characters tested are not equal: 
C@(u,~,a,b,v,~,w) == C~(u,a,~,b,v,#,w)/({a}n {T,P,Q,C})=~A a/b. 
The actual writ ing of rules is, of course, more economical, e.g. the 
left members are not repeated, etc. Thus, original English words like 
THERMOELASTICITY, PHILOSOPHY, QUANTIFIER, ILLUSTRATE, MASSIVE become 
Czech stems TERMOELASTICIT, FILOSOFI, KVANTIFIKA2~OR,L~SI2VNI2 (note 
that the digit 2 following a vowel denotes the diacrit ical mark "'" 
indicating length), respectively; first, of course, they are provided 
with all necessary information, reintegrated and brought to the can- 
onical form required by the system. 
In our experimental system, the TD operates on a relatively 
narrow, semantical ly circumscribed domain of scientific and technic- 
al sublanguage concerned with microelectronics: this makes it possib- 
le to keep the semantic description apparatus at an adequate and, at 
the same time, suff iciently general level, a condit ion on which the 
"profitableness" of TD depends under circumstances described. The 
programme of TD written in Colmerauer's Q-systems (Q-language) 
consists of less than 90 instructions (rules with a relatively high 
degree of recursion involved) and it is supposed to cover a set of 
thousands of lexical items, most of which represent very frequent 
terms or term components. In the described environments (experiment- 
ing with Engl ish-Czech machine translation, microelectronics) the 
device disclosed has proved extremely effective and there are reasons 
to believe that it can serve its purpose in other conditions as well: 
e.g. in application to other pairs or multiplets of languages, in 
other domains, and/or applied in a different, theoretical ly more 
scrupulous manner, it may give even better results. 
The latter observation deserves some comment. So far, the appl- 
ication of transducing dictionary in the framework of our experiment 
has benn considered. However, this particular way of application must 
not be regarded as anything else than purely experimental testing of 
this device in partial ly simpified conditions; in fact, the results 
of such a testing have been reported on in the preceding paragraphs. 
In a full-f ledged system of natural language analysis and synthesis, 
the considerably more developed semantic apparatus would impose much 
more rigorous restrictions on the constitution of uniform, semantic- 
ally homogeneous, classes to be covered by TD, which might impair its 
effectivity considerably. The proper place of TD is at the morphemic 
or morphonemic level. If the operation of TD is confined to these 
domains only (grammatical and semantic information being assigned in 
another place), its use can be generalized, so that, in substance, all 
words formally belonging to the classes defined purely on morphemic 
and orthographic grounds can be transduced by it. Exceptions are rare; 
some of them can be solved in the framework of special morphemic de-

compos i t ion  (as in the above example - ~IINI~IISE vs. LOCALISE>, some 
must be handled by the d ic t ionar ies  that precede the app l icat ion  of 
TD in the a lgor i thm - stat ist ics  must  decide what should be regarded 
as except ional  (e.g. the ending -XIAL in Engl ish may give -XNf or 
-X IALNf  in Czech - EP ITAXIAL  vs. COAXIAL ; however, it should be 
observed in this place that both vers ions - the genera l ly  accepted 
one (EPITAXNf) and the other (EPITAXI~LNf)  would be undoubted ly  under- 
stood without  any d i f f i cu l ty  by the reader>. In this connect ion,  it 
should be pointed out, that, in such h ighly spec ia l i zed domains as 
microe lect ron ics  or computer  system programming,etc ,  the widely used 
pract ice  of taking over and adapt ing foreign express ions  af fects  
in a high degree regions t rad i t iona l ly  "protected" by normat ive 
grammar ians  and patr iot ic  termino log is ts  (GETTER = "GETR", CHIP = 
"~IP", HOLD ="HOLDOVAT",  AEEND = "ABENDOVAT", PRI~TER = "PRINTR", 
etc.>; in our opinion,  this pract ice  is very often ful ly just i f ied 
and it should be rather coord inated than condemned,  since it makes 
prompt and correct  unders tand ing  between experts  possible,  and it

to a new phase in the rapprochement  ment ioned above. Nhether  a new 
or adapted TD l ike device may be found usefu l ' in  this domain, too, 
remains to be seen.
