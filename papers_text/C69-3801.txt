Chinese machine t rans la t lon  can be achieved by organ iz ing  a l l  
the  necessary  l lng~is t i c  data  in such a way that  the  computer can 
compare and re t r ieve  them in the most economical  way. We are 
constant ly  reminded that  the  s torage  space in the  co~uter  i s  
l im i ted ,  and the  process ing  t ime is  expens ive .  We mmst aim at  the  
e f f i c iency  of  the  system wi thout  sacr i f i c ing  accuracy .  
Five types  of l ingu is t i c  data have to  be s tored  in the  computer 
be fore  a t rans la t ion  can be rendered:  (1) a Chinese to  Eng l i sh  
d ic t ionary ,  (2) Chinese syntact i c  ru les ,  (3) syntact i c  convers lon  
ru les  from Chinese s t ruc ture  to  Eng l i sh  s t ruc ture ,  (4) Eng l i sh  
morpholog ica l  ru les ,  and (5) the text  to  be t rans la ted .  
(1) The d ic t ionary  must have the  capab i l i ty  to  d i s t ingu ish  
automat ica l ly  the  d i f fe rent  meanings which a Chinese lexeme represents .  
l~anmn readers  can do th i s  and 8o can the  machine i f  enough l ingu is t i c  
in fo rmat ion  is  s to red  in the  computer.  To a cer ta in  extent  the  
meanings of  a g iven lexema can be d i f fe rent ia ted  by i t s  d i f fe rent  
syntact i c  funct ions .  For example the  word i means 'one '  when i t  
18 used as a numeral .  A numeral i8 de f ined  as the  c lass  of  words 
which is  fo l lowed by a c lass i f ie r ,  a measure,  a co l lec t ive  and a 
par t i t i ve  noun and o ther  numera ls .  I means 'once '  when i t  i8 used 
as an adverb  which i s  a lways fo l lowed by a verb .  Anything e l se  which 
i s  not covered  by these  two ru les  w i l l  have to  be l i s ted  in the  
d ic t ionary  e i ther  as an idiom or as a laxeme with i t s  immediate 
const i tuent .  Sometimes a ,,ore re f ined  syntact i c  codes are  needed 
to  d i s t ingu ish  the  d i f fe rent  meanings of a g iven  verb ,  as in  the 
case of  t zuoh  ~.  When i t  i s  fo l lowed by an inan imate  noun, i t  
i s  t rans la ted  to  'make ' ,  by an abst rac t  noun, i t  i8 t rans la ted  to  
'do ' ,and  by a human noun, i t  i s  t rans la ted  to  'be ' .  Any o ther  
const i tu tes  which are  except ions  to  the ru les  w i l l  have to  be l i s ted  
in  the  d ic t ionary ,  such as tzuoh  ran 'behave ' ,  tzuoh fann ' cook ' ,  
and tzuoh  show 'ce lebrate  a b i r thday ' .  
For the  conven ience  of  programming, each d ic t ionary  ent ry .  
which may be a lexeme, an id iom or a const i tu te ,  has only one syn-  
tac t i c  code and i t s  respect ive  meaning.  A f te r  a sentence  has been 
anal~.eed by the  automat ic  parser ,  the  syntact i c  funct ion  o f  each 
lexeme i8 determined .  Together  w i th  the  method of longest  match 
in  d ic t ionary  lookup,  the  cor rec t  meaning of  a g iven  lexeme in a 
g iven  context  can be chosen by the  machine.  
(2) The Ch inese syntact i c  ru les  are fo rmulated  in such a way 
that  they  may reduce the  ambigu i t ies  in pars ing  to  a minimum. I t  i s  
assumed that  in a good sc ient i f i c  wr i t ing ,  tl~e sentences  are  not 
ambiguous and there  i s  on ly  one cor rec t  way of  pars ing  which can 
car ry  the  process  to  the  end of the  sentence .  Anybody who has had 
any exper ience  w i th  the  automat ic  parser  w i l l  know th i s  goa l  i s  
3 
hard to  ach ieve .  Severa l  ways have been found to  reduce the m~bigu l -  
t ies ,  and probab ly  there  are o thers .  
One of the  methods i s  to  add more re f inements  to  the  syntact i c  
codes.  Semantic e lements  mere in t roduced in the fo rau la t lon  of  the  
syntact i c  codes,  so that  the  const i tu tes  must be meaningfu l  as we l l  
g rammat ica l .  For example:  by adding the human e lement to  the  codes,  
on ly  the  human nouns can be the agents  of the  human verbs .  I f  an 
inan imate  noun occurs  before  a human verb ,  i t  i s  l i ke ly  to  be the  
goal  ra ther  than the  agent of the  verb .  For fu r ther  re f inement ,  
the  e lement  of p lu ra l i ty  i s  a l so  added to  the  codes,  so that  on ly  
the p lu ra l  nouns can be the agents  of p lu ra l  verbs .  There i s  a c lass  
of adverbs ,  such as i torng * together ' ,  huh sh iang *mutua l ly '  end 
b i i  t syy  ' to  each other*  usua l ly  p lu ra l i ze  any verb that  fo l lows  them. 
The second method of reduc ing  ambigu i t ies  i s  to  in t roduce  h igher  
leve ls  to  the  noun and verb phrases .  There are  ~ive leve ls  of  noun 
phrases  for  example.  The te rmina l  code i s  ca l led  leve l  1. When the  
noun i s  modi f ied  by an ad jec t ive ,  a noun or an ad jec t ive  phrase,  the  
noun phrase  i s  ca l led  leve l  2. Level 1 or 2 modi f ied  by a number 
and a c lass i f ie r  i s  ca l led  leve l  3. Modi f ied  by e determiner ,  it i s  
ca l led  leve l  4. When the la t te r  i s  mod i f ied  by a pronoun, a re la t ive  
c lause  or an appos i t ion ,  i t  i s  ca l led  leve l  5. The noun phrase of  
leve l  5 i s  a c losed  noun phrase ;  noth ing  e l se  can be added to  i t .  
The const i tu te  IRD ( ind icat ive  express ion)  i s  formed by a c losed  
noun phrase  and a c losed  verb phrase .  Even i f  the  noun phrase  
cons is ts  of  on ly  the  te rmina l  code,  th i s  ru le  a l so  app l ies  l inear ly .

The th i rd  way o f  reduc ing  the  ambigu i t ies  i s  to  adopt  the  
pr inc ip le  o f  the  longest  match  in  the  d ic t ionary  lookup.  Jus t  take  
the  four  characters  yen  yan  shyue  j ia  ' l i ngu is t '  as  an  exsmple ;  a l l  
four  o f  them can  be  used  f ree ly  or  ind iv idua l ly .  The f i r s t  th ree  
characters  a re  both  nouns  and  verbs .  AS nouns  the  f i r s t  two mean 
both  ' language '  and  'word ' ,  and  the  th i rd  means ' learn ing ' .  As verbs ,  
the  f i r s t  two mean ' speak '  and  th i rd ,  ' l earn ' .  The four th  one means 
' - i s t ' ,  ' fami ly '  and  'home' .  The compound o f  the  f i r s t  two means 
' language '  and  that  o f  the  las t  two means ' - i s t  ' .  The compound o f  the  
f i r s t  th ree  characters  means  ' l ingu is t i cs ' .  S ix ty  unwanted  const i tu tes  
can  resu l t  f rom these  four  characters  a lone .  With  the  longest  match  
w i th  the  d ic t ionary  ent ry ,  the  four  characters  ac t  as  a s ing le  un i t ,  
and  thus  s ix ty  ambigu i t ies  can  be e l iminated .  
(3)  The syntact i c  convers ion  ru les  f rom Ch inese  to  Eng l i sh  
are  fo rmulated  on the  bas is  o f  comparat ive  s tudy  o f  the  s t ructures  
o f  both  Ch inese  and  Eng l i sh  sentences  wh ich  represent  the  same mean-  
lug .  I t  i s  assumed that  i f  the  s t ructure  o f  the  Eng l i sh  sentence  
or  phrase  i s  the  same as  that  o f  the  Ch inese  sentence  or  phrase ,  
no syntactical conversion is necessary. Simple lexical substitution 
and the application o? the English morphological rules will render 
the correct translation. Diagram I shows that the structure of the 
I 
Eng l i sh  i s  the  same as  that  o f  the  Ch inese .  By p lac ing  the  Eng l i sh  
equ iva lents  in  the  locat ion  o f  the  grammar  codes  (The grammar  codes  
are  used  in  pars ing . ) ,  the  t rans la t ion  i s  a l ready  rendered  in  the  
c i ta t ion  fo rms.  The las t  th ing  that  needs  to  be done i s  to  app ly  
the English morphological rules to the citation forms, so that 'that' 
is changed to 'those' and 'linguist' to 'linguists' and 'write' '~d '  
to 'wrote ' 
The structures of many Engl?sh phrases are not the same as those 
of the Chinese phrases .  In cases  l i ke  these ,  some syntact i c  conver -  
s ions ,  in the forms of permutat ion,  add i t ion  or de le t ion  are needed. 
The fo~lowin~ examples will illustrate the logic on the basis of 
which the syntactic conversion rules are formulated. 
The verb phrase which consists of a prepositional phrase and 
a main verb calls for a simple permutation in the conversion. The 
code for such a verb phrase is VI*R (or VIHtR if the human element 
is added) where * indicates that a conversion is needed aud R indi- 
cates that the conversion is in the form of permutation of the two 
const i tuents .

The arrow (used in the sense of programming language)  ind icates  
where the  convers ion  occurs .  The two i tems on the le f t  s ide  of the  
ar roe  are  rep laced  by the two i tems on the  r ight  s ide .  The const i -  
tuents  of these  two eonst f tu tesw?11 fo l lo~ accord ing ly .  This 
convers ion  can be eas i ly  man ipu la ted  by the  machine. 
Even though the Chinese pret rans i t l ve  prepos i t ion ,  ba__~eor jlan_._.~g, 
i s  the  same as o ther  p repos i t ions  s t ruc tura l ly ,  i t  i s  de le ted  in 
the English structure. Therefore an additional conversion rule NB*L 
is needed. The L after the * indicates that the l e f t  constituent is 
to  be de le ted .

The conversion rule for the passive construction on the other 
hand requires addition. For example: 
VI*P 
WP2 VTH*B < VTH*B ~372 
~ - -~ $~ "~ ~ '~,.- ~ be break~en by one ch i ld  
A l l  the  syntact i c  convers ion  ru les  are e i ther  unary or b inary  
(some longer  ones are  fo rced  to  be b inary )  in order  to  save tab le  
space in the  computer.  The tab le  of const i tu tes  resu l ted  from the  
automatic parser consists of three columns: the array of the constitutes, 
the array of the left constituents and the array of the right constitu- 
ents. A search through the array of the constitutes, the computer 
will know where and what conversion rules are, to be applied. For 
example :

Another  advantage  o f  such  a sys tem i s  that  fu r ther  d i f fe rent ia t ion  
o f  mean ings  i s  made poss ib le .  I t  has  been ment ioned ear l ie r  that  the  
mean ings  o f  a g iven  lexeme can  be  d i f fe rent ia ted  by i t s  context .  When 
the  context  i s  as  long  as  a c lause  or  a phrase ,  i t  i s  best  hand led  by 
syntact i c  convers ion  ru les .  For  example :  the  character  ~'~ de  i s  t rans la ted  
to  ' ' s ' ,  "o f ' ,  'who (wh ich ,  when or  where) ' ,  ' the  one who (wh ich ,  when 
or  where) '  and  '~ '  under  d i f fe rent  cond i t ions ,  a prob lem cannot  be 
so lved  by  d ic t ionary  lookup,  but  can  be so lved  by the  d i f fe rent  
const i tu tes  i t  fo rms w i th  o ther  const i tuents .  
The const i tu te  NDE, whose le f t  const i tuent  i s  a noun or  verb  
phrase  o f  any  leve l  o r  a who le  c lause  and whose  r ight  const i tuent  i s  
de ,  can  be  an  ad jec t ive  or  a noun.  I t  i s  an  ad jec t ive  when i t  i8  
fo l lowed by  a noun phrase  and i t  i s  a noun when i t  i s  p receded or  
fo l lowed by  a verb  phrase .  F i r s t  o f  a l l  i t s  funct ion  shou ld  be 
determined by  the  automat ic  parser~ the  noun (NNDE) i s  d i s t ingu ished  
f rom the  ad jec t ive  (NDE). The in terna l  s t ructures  o f  both  are  the  
same in  Ch inese ,  but  they  represent  d i f fe rent  mean ings  wh ich  are  re -  
p resented  by  d i f fe rent  Eng l i sh  lexemes .  Emphas is  shou ld  be made here  
that  th i s  i s  not  an  ad  hoc  a t tempt  to  wr i te  a Ch inese  grammar  on the  
bas is  o f  Eng l i sh  t rans la t ion ,  but  an  a t tempt  to  incorporate  semant ic  
I0 
information into the system as demanded by the machine. Very fre- 
quently the different English translations point out the fact that 
a given Chinese lexeme represents different meanings in different 
contexts. A closer analysis of the contexts will reveal that the 
conditions which produce the same translation are usually consistent- 
ly similar. 
The two sub-classes of NDE and NNDE are not sufficient to differ- 
entiate the various meanings de represents. Further refinements have 
to be made within each subclass of NDE or NNDE. The following pairs 
(NDE and NNDE) of conversion rules will illustrate this point. 
(a) Possession The meaning of possession is represented by 
de in Chinese and 's  in English when they are preceded by animate 
nouns, especially human nouns,and pronouns. Both the adjective 
and the nominal forms can be converted the same way.

(b) Part of a whole When de is preceded by an inanimate noun 
or an abstract noun, it represents the meaning 'part of a whole' which 
is  usual ly  t rans la ted  to 'o f '  in Engl ish.  For example: 
NB*R NB*R

~ ~ ~? be on~ude~of wood 
If the class of bin only includes material nouns, such as cloth, 
wood, metal and others, then the DE can be replaced by ONE MADE OF. 
Otherwise it can only be converted to ONE OF. 
(c) A connective which represents no meaning When de is 
preceded by an ad jec t ive ,  i t  has no meaning. Therefore i t  is 
deleted in the conversion.

(f) A translated syntactic connective The de connects a verb 
phrase to a noun represents no meaning, but it has an English equiva- 
lent in the form of a relative pronoun. The case of the pronoun 
depends on the constituent that precedes the de. 
If the verb phrase consists of an intransitive verb phrase, 
the noun that the NDE modifies, or the NNDE implies is the subject 
of the verb phrase. For example: 
NH* R NH* R

VC VTH NN DE VC ONEWHO ~ NN 
~ ~ ~-~ he the o~e who ~o, boo~ 
WHO and ONEWHO are used as codes for subjective relative pro- 
nouns. They may be where, which or when depending on their antece- 
dents. In order to make the computer to choose between where, who, 
which and when, more re f inements  have to  be in t roduced  to  the  
codes of h igher  nodes.  
I f  the  verb  phrase be fore  the de cons is ts  of a sub jec t  (or  agent )  
and a t rans i t i ve  verb ,  the  noun that  the  NDE mod i f ies  and the  NNDE 
impl ies  i s  the  ob jec t  of the  verb phrase .  For example:

When the  const i tu te  i s  formed by a complete c lause  and de, i t  can 
only be an ad jec t ive  which usua l ly  mod i f ies  the  nouns such as t ime,  
p lace ,  method, ins t rument ,  manner and cond i t ion .  I t s  convers ion  ru le  
i s  the  same as that  for  the  in t rans i t i ve  verb phrase .  
Of the  mi l l i ons  of  de phrases ,  ten  convers ion  ru les  are  su f f l -  
c ient  to  d i f fe rent ia te  the  many meanings that  d_~e represents ,  and render  
a rough but  adequate  t rans la t ion .  In  fac t  not many convers ion  ru lQe are 
needed. In  add i t ion  to  those  ment ioned above, there  a re  those for  
comparat ive  const ruct ions ,  locat ive  phrase and some minor ones. 
(~) Eng l i sh  morpho log ica l  ru les  have been worked out by o thers .  
How they  w i l l  be app l ied  to  machine t rans la t ion  from Chinese to  Eng- 
l i sh  i s  a problem yet  to  be so lved .  Some of  the  so lu t ions  can be 
wr i t ten  in to  the  d ic t ionary ,  and some, incorporated  in to  the  syntact i c  
convers ion  ru les .  A great  deal  of  research  have been done in th i s  
a rea ;  the  main problem i s  to  implement he in fo rmat ion  to  the 
ex is t ing  system. 
(5) The Ch inese text  to  be t rans la ted  i s  encoded in the 
Chinese te legraph ic  codes.  The problem of a l lographs  ( inc lud ing  
abbrev ia t ions )  are  taken  care  of  by the d ic t ionary  lookup.  The 
a l lographs  represent  the  same lexeme are re fer red  to  that  lexeme by 
the  sys tem.  Punctuat ions  prove to  be confus ing .  The per iod  i s  used 
to  te rminate  a sentence ,  any o ther  usage of the per iod ,  such as 
marking the  end of  a sub- t i t le ,  shou ld  be e l iminated .  Otherwise 
every  sentence  can be nomina l i zed  by the automat ic  parser .  
With some knowledge of PL / I ,  I am tempted to  say that  machine 
t rans la t ion  from Chinese to  Eng l i sh  i s  not only  poss ib le ,  i t  is  a l so  
easy  to  program. A program can be wr i t ten  to  read the d ic t ionary ,  
the  syntact i c  ru les  and the text ,  parse  the  sentences  and s tore  
the  const i tu tes .  The program searches  through the ar ray  of const i tu tes  
for  the  symbol of *, and then per forms the syntact i c  convers ions  as 
ind icated  by the codes  that  fo l low the *. Once th i s  i s  done, the 
r 
program ret r ieves  the  const i tuents  of each  const i tu te  unt i l  the 
const i tuents  are the  te rmina l  laxemes? Then the t rans la t ion  i s  
a l ready  rendered  in the  c i ta t ion  forms. 
I t  i s  un for tunate  that  machine t rans la t ion  was cons idered  
15 
imposs ib le  a few years  ago. and research  e f fo r ts  were cur ta i led .  
Cor rec t  machine t rans la t ion  of modern sc ient i f i c  wr i t ing  i s  poss ib le  
i f  enough organ ized  l ingu is t i c  data  are  s to red  in the computer.  
In the  past  twe lve  years  the r ig id  demands imposed by the computer 
have acce le ra ted  the progress  of l ingu is t i c  research  on many nat ive  
languages .  I t  i s  due to  the demand of the  automat ic  parser ,  the  
sys temat i zed  syntact i c  ru les  were fo rmulated .  I t  i s  due the 
demand of choos ing automat ica l ly  the cor rec t  t rans la t ion  by the  com- 
puter ,  the Study of semant ics  was in i t ia ted .  Now the meanings of 
a g iven  lexeme can be d i f fe rent ia ted  in terms of i t s  context .  With 
more soph is t i ca ted  l ingu is t i c  data  of both source and ta rget  languages ,  
more e f f i c ient  prograu~ing language,  and b igger  and fas ter  computers ,  
machine t rans la t ion  can be a rea l i ty  in the near fu ture .
