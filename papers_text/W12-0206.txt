Abstract
We demonstrate how data-driven ap-
proaches to learner corpora can support
Second Language Acquisition research
when integrated with visualisation tools.
We present a visual user interface support-
ing the investigation of a set of linguistic
features discriminating between pass and
fail ?English as a Second or Other Lan-
guage? exam scripts. The system displays
directed graphs to model interactions
between features and supports exploratory
search over a set of learner scripts. We
illustrate how the interface can support
the investigation of the co-occurrence
of many individual features, and discuss
how such investigations can shed light on
understanding the linguistic abilities that
characterise different levels of attainment
and, more generally, developmental aspects
of learner grammars.
1 Introduction
The Common European Framework of Reference
for Languages (CEFR)1 is an international bench-
mark of language attainment at different stages of
learning. The English Profile (EP)2 research pro-
gramme aims to enhance the learning, teaching
and assessment of English as an additional lan-
guage by creating detailed reference level descrip-
tions of the language abilities expected at each
level. As part of our research within that frame-
work, we modify and combine techniques devel-
oped for information visualisation with method-
ologies from computational linguistics to support
a novel and more empirical perspective on CEFR

levels. In particular, we build a visual user in-
terface (hereafter UI) which aids the develop-
ment of hypotheses about learner grammars us-
ing graphs of linguistic features discriminating
pass/fail exam scripts for intermediate English.
Briscoe et al (2010) use supervised discrimi-
native machine learning methods to automate the
assessment of ?English as a Second or Other Lan-
guage? (ESOL) exam scripts, and in particular, the
First Certificate in English (FCE) exam, which
assesses English at an upper-intermediate level
(CEFR level B2). They use a binary discrimina-
tive classifier to learn a linear threshold function
that best discriminates passing from failing FCE
scripts, and predict whether a script can be clas-
sified as such. To facilitate learning of the clas-
sification function, the data should be represented
appropriately with the most relevant set of (lin-
guistic) features. They found a discriminative fea-
ture set includes, among other feature types, lexi-
cal and part-of-speech (POS) ngrams. We extract
the discriminative instances of these two feature
types and focus on their linguistic analysis3. Ta-
ble 1 presents a small subset ordered by discrimi-
native weight.
The investigation of discriminative features can
offer insights into assessment and into the linguis-
tic properties characterising the relevant CEFR
level. However, the amount and variety of data
potentially made available by the classifier is con-
siderable, as it typically finds hundreds of thou-
sands of discriminative feature instances. Even
if investigation is restricted to the most discrim-
inative ones, calculations of relationships be-

tween features can rapidly grow and become over-
whelming. Discriminative features typically cap-
ture relatively low-level, specific and local prop-
erties of texts, so features need to be linked to the
scripts they appear in to allow investigation of the
contexts in which they occur. The scripts, in turn,
need to be searched for further linguistic prop-
erties in order to formulate and evaluate higher-
level, more general and comprehensible hypothe-
ses which can inform reference level descriptions
and understanding of learner grammars.
The appeal of information visualisation is to
gain a deeper understanding of important phe-
nomena that are represented in a database (Card et
al., 1999) by making it possible to navigate large
amounts of data for formulating and testing hy-
potheses faster, intuitively, and with relative ease.
An important challenge is to identify and assess
the usefulness of the enormous number of pro-
jections that can potentially be visualised. Explo-
ration of (large) databases can lead quickly to nu-
merous possible research directions; lack of good
tools often slows down the process of identifying
the most productive paths to pursue.
In our context, we require a tool that visu-
alises features flexibly, supports interactive inves-
tigation of scripts instantiating them, and allows
statistics about scripts, such as the co-occurrence
of features or presence of other linguistic proper-
ties, to be derived quickly. One of the advantages
of using visualisation techniques over command-
line database search tools is that Second Lan-
guage Acquisition (SLA) researchers and related
users, such as assessors and teachers, can access
scripts, associated features and annotation intu-
itively without the need to learn query language
syntax.
We modify previously-developed visualisation
techniques (Di Battista et al, 1999) and build a
visual UI supporting hypothesis formation about
learner grammars. Features are grouped in terms
of their co-occurrence in the corpus and directed
graphs are used in order to illustrate their rela-
tionships. Selection of different feature combi-
nations automatically generates queries over the
data and returns the relevant scripts as well as as-
sociations with meta-data and different types of
errors committed by the learners4. In the next sec-
4Our interface integrates a command-line Lucene search
tool (Gospodnetic and Hatcher, 2004) developed by Gram
and Buttery (2009).

tions we describe in detail the visualiser, illustrate
how it can support the investigation of individual
features, and discuss how such investigations can
shed light on the relationships between features
and developmental aspects of learner grammars.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to visually analyse as well as perform
a linguistic interpretation of discriminative fea-
tures that characterise learner English. We also
apply our visualiser to a set of 1,244 publically-
available FCE ESOL texts (Yannakoudakis et al,
2011) and make it available as a web service to
other researchers5.
2 Dataset
We use texts produced by candidates taking the
FCE exam, which assesses English at an upper-
intermediate level. The FCE texts, which are
part of the Cambridge Learner Corpus6, are pro-
duced by English language learners from around
the world sitting Cambridge Assessment?s ESOL
examinations7. The texts are manually tagged
with information about linguistic errors (Nicholls,
2003) and linked to meta-data about the learners
(e.g., age and native language) and the exam (e.g.,
grade).
3 The English Profile visualiser
3.1 Basic structure and front-end
The English Profile (EP) visualiser is developed
in Java and uses the Prefuse library (Heer et
al., 2005) for the visual components. Figure 1
shows its front-end. Features are represented

by a labelled node and displayed in the central
panel; positive features (i.e., those associated with
passing the exam) are shaded in a light green
colour while negative ones are light red8. A field
at the bottom right supports searching for fea-
tures/nodes that start with specified characters and
highlighting them in blue. An important aspect is
the display of feature patterns, discussed in more
detail in the next section (3.2).
3.2 Feature relations
Crucial to understanding discriminative features
is finding the relationships that hold between
them. We calculate co-occurrences of features at
the sentence-level in order to extract ?meaningful?
relations and possible patterns of use. Combi-
nations of features that may be ?useful? are kept
while the rest are discarded. ?Usefulness? is mea-
sured as follows:
Consider the set of all the sentences in the cor-
pus S = {s1, s2, ..., sN} and the set of all the fea-
tures F = {f1, f2, ..., fM}. A feature fi ? F is
associated with a feature fj ? F , where i 6= j
and 1 ? i, j ? M , if their relative co-occurrence
score is within a predefined range:
score(fj , fi) =
?N
k=1 exists(fj , fi, sk)
?N
k=1 exists(fi, sk)
(1)
8Colours can be customised by the user.
where sk ? S, 1 ? k ? N , exists() is a
binary function that returns 1 if the input fea-
tures occur in sk, and 0 ? score(fj , fi) ? 1.
We group features in terms of their relative co-
occurrence within sentences in the corpus and dis-
play these co-occurrence relationships as directed
graphs. Two nodes (features) are connected by
an edge if their score, based on Equation (1), is
within a user-defined range (see example below).
Given fi and fj , the outgoing edges of fi are mod-
elled using score(fj , fi) and the incoming edges
using score(fi, fj). Feature relations are shown
via highlighting of features when the user hovers
the cursor over them, while the strength of the re-
lations is visually encoded in the edge width.
For example, one of the highest-weighted pos-
itive discriminative features is VM RR (see Ta-
ble 1), which captures sequences of a modal
auxiliary followed by an adverb as in will al-
ways (avoid) or could clearly (see). Investigat-
ing its relative co-occurrence with other features
using a score range of 0.8?1 and regardless of
directionality, we find that VM RR is related to
the following: (i) POS ngrams: RR VB? AT1,
VM RR VB?, VM RR VH?, PPH1 VM RR,
VM RR VV?, PPIS1 VM RR, PPIS2 VM RR,
RR VB?; (ii) word ngrams: will also, can only,
can also, can just. These relations show us the
37
syntactic environments of the feature (i) or its
characteristic lexicalisations (ii).
3.3 Dynamic creation of graphs via selection
criteria
Questions relating to a graph display may include
information about the most connected nodes, sep-
arate components of the graph, types of intercon-
nected features, etc. However, the functionality,
usability and tractability of graphs is severely lim-
ited when the number of nodes and edges grows
by more than a few dozen (Fry, 2007). In order
to provide adequate information, but at the same
time avoid overly complex graphs, we support dy-
namic creation and visualisation of graphs using
a variety of selection criteria. The EP visualiser
supports the flexible investigation of the top 4,000
discriminative features and their relations.
The Menu item on the top left of the UI in Fig-
ure 1 activates a panel that enables users to select
the top N features to be displayed. The user can
choose whether to display positive and/or neg-
ative features and set thresholds for, as well as
rank by discriminative weight, connectivity with
other features (i.e., the number of features it is
connected to), and frequency. For instance, a
user can choose to investigate features that have
a connectivity between 500 and 900, rank them
by frequency and display the top 100. Highly-
connected features might tell us something about
the learner grammar while infrequent features, al-
though discriminative, might not lead to useful
linguistic insights. Additionally, users can in-
vestigate feature relations and set different score
ranges according to Equation (1), which controls
the edges to be displayed.
Figure 2(a) presents the graph of the 5 most
frequent negative features, using a score range
of 0.8?1. The system displays only one edge,
while the rest of the features are isolated. How-
ever, these features might be related to other fea-
tures from the list of 4,000 (which are not dis-
played since they are not found in the top N
list of features). Blue aggregation markers in the
shape of a circle, located at the bottom right of
each node, are used to visually display that in-
formation. When a node with an aggregation
marker is selected, the system automatically ex-
pands the graph and displays the related features.
The marker shape of an expanded node changes
to a star, while a different border stroke pattern

quent negative features using a

is used to visually distinguish the revealed nodes
from the top N . Figure 2(b) presents the ex-
panded graph when the aggregation marker for the
feature VVD II is selected. If the same aggrega-
tion marker is selected twice, the graph collapses
and returns to its original form.
3.4 Feature?Error relations
The FCE texts have been manually error-coded
(Nicholls, 2003) so it is possible to find associa-
tions between discriminative features and specific
error types. The Feature?Error relations compo-
nent on the left of Figure 1 displays a list of the
features, ranked by their discriminative weight,
together with statistics on their relations with er-
rors. Feature?error relations are computed at the
sentence level by calculating the proportion of
sentences containing a feature that also contain
a specific error (similar to Equation (1)). In the
example in Figure 1, we see that 27% of the sen-
tences that contain the feature bigram the people
also have an unnecessary determiner (UD) error,
while 14% have a replace verb (RV) error9.
9In the example image we only output the top 5 errors
(can be customised by the user).

gives error frequencies for the matching scripts, including the frequencies of lemmata and POSs inside an error.
3.5 Searching the data
In order to allow the user to explore how fea-
tures are related to the data, the EP visualiser
supports browsing operations. Selecting multiple
features ? highlighted in yellow ? and clicking
on the button get scripts returns relevant scripts.
The right panel of the front-end in Figure 1 dis-
plays a number of search and output options.
Users can choose to output the original/error-
coded/POS-tagged text and/or the grammatical
relations found by the RASP parser (Briscoe et
al., 2006), while different colours are used in or-
der to help readability. Data can be retrieved at
the sentence or script level and separated accord-
ing to grade. Additionally, Boolean queries can be
executed in order to examine occurrences of (se-
lected features and) specific errors only10. Also,
users can investigate scripts based on meta-data
information such as learner age.
Figure 3 shows the display of the system when
the features how to and RGQ TO VV? (how to
followed by a verb in base form) are selected. The
text area in the centre displays sentences instanti-
ating them. A search box at the top supports nav-

taining replace or word order errors.
igation, highlighting search terms in red, while
a small text area underneath displays the current
search query, the size of the database and the num-
ber of matching scripts or sentences. The Errors
by decreasing frequency pane on the left shows
a list of the errors found in the matching scripts,
ordered by decreasing frequency. Three different
tabs (lemma, POS and lemma POS) provide in-
formation about and allow extraction of counts of
lemmata and POSs inside an error tag.
3.6 Learner native language
Research on SLA highlights the possible effect of
a native language (L1) on the learning process.
Using the Menu item on the top left corner of
Figure 1, users can select the language of inter-
est while the system displays a new window with
an identical front-end and functionality. Feature?
error statistics are now displayed per L1, while
selecting multiple features returns scripts written
by learners speaking the chosen L1.
4 Interpreting discriminative features: a
case study
We now illustrate in greater depth how the EP vi-
sualiser can support interpretation of discrimina-
tive features: the POS trigram RG JJ NN1 (?) is
39
the 18th most discriminative (negative) feature. It
corresponds to a sequence of a degree adverb fol-
lowed by an adjective and a singular noun as in
very good boy. The question is why such a fea-
ture is negative since the string is not ungrammat-
ical. Visualisation of this feature using the ?dy-
namic graph creation? component of the visualiser
allows us to see the features it is related to. This
offers an intuitive and manageable way of inves-
tigating the large number of underlying discrimi-
native features.
We find that RG JJ NN1 is related to its dis-
criminative lexicalisation, very good (?), which
is the 513th most discriminative feature. Also,
it is related to JJ NN1 II (?) (e.g., difficult sport
at), ranked 2,700th, which suggests a particular
context for RG JJ NN1 when the noun is fol-
lowed by a preposition. Searching for this con-
junction of features in scripts, we get production
examples like 1a,b,c. Perhaps more interestingly,
RG JJ NN1 is related to VBZ RG (?) (ranked
243rd): is followed by a degree adverb. This
relation suggests a link with predicative struc-
tures since putting the two ngrams together yields
strings VBZ RG JJ NN1 corresponding to exam-
ples like 1c,d; if we also add II we get examples
like 1c.
1a It might seem to be very difficult sport at the
beginning.
1b We know a lot about very difficult situation
in your country.
1c I think it?s very good idea to spending vaca-
tion together.
1d Unix is very powerful system but there is one
thing against it.
The associations between features already give
an idea of the source of the problem. In the se-
quences including the verb be the indefinite ar-
ticle is omitted. So the next thing to investigate
is if indeed RG JJ NN1 is associated with ar-
ticle omission, not only in predicative contexts,
but more generally. The Feature?Error relations
component of the UI reveals an association with
MD (missing determiner) errors: 23% of sen-
tences that contain RG JJ NN1 also have a MD
error. The same holds for very good, JJ NN1 II
and VBZ RG with percentages 12%, 14% and

15% respectively. We then compared the num-
ber of MD errors per script across different types
of scripts. Across all scripts the ratio MD:doc
is 2.18, that is, approximately 2 MD errors per
script; in RG JJ NN1 scripts this ratio goes up
to 2.75, so that each script has roughly 3 MD
errors. VBZ RG follows with 2.68, JJ NN1 II
with 2.48, and very good with 2.32. In scripts
containing all features the ratio goes up to 4.02
(3.68 without very good), and in scripts contain-
ing VBZ RG JJ the ratio goes up to 2.73. Also,
in most of these scripts the error involves the in-
definite article. The emerging picture then is that
there is a link between these richer nominal struc-
tures that include more than one modifier and the
omission of the article. Two questions arise: (i)
why these richer nominals should associate with
article omission and (ii) why only singular nouns
are implicated in this feature.
Article omission errors are typical of learn-
ers coming from L1s lacking an article sys-
tem (Robertson, 2000; Ionin and Montrul, 2010;
Hawkins and Buttery, 2010). Trenkic (2008) pro-
poses that such learners analyse articles as adjecti-
val modifiers rather than as a separate category of
determiners or articles. When no adjective is in-
volved, learners may be aware that bare nominals
are ungrammatical in English and provide the ar-
ticle. However, with complex adjectival phrases,
learners may omit the article because of the pres-
ence of a degree adverb. In order to evaluate this
hypothesis further we need to investigate if arti-
cle omission is indeed more pronounced in our
data with more complex adjectival phrases e.g.,
very difficult situation than with simpler ones e.g.,
nice boy and whether this is primarily the case for
40
learners from L1s lacking articles.
Again, using the Errors by decreasing fre-
quency pane we found that the MD:doc ratio in
scripts containing the bigram JJ NN1 is 2.20. Ad-
ditionally, in scripts containing JJ NN1 and not
RG JJ NN1 it goes down to 2.04. These results
are much lower compared to the MD:doc ratio
in scripts containing RG JJ NN1 and/or the fea-
tures with which it is related (see above), fur-
ther supporting our hypothesis. We also found
the ratio of RG JJ NN1 (f1) occurrences per doc-
ument across different L1s, as well as the ratio
of VBZ RG JJ (f2), VBZ RG JJ NN1 (f3) and
RG JJ NN1 II (f4). As shown in Table 2 there
is no correlation between these features and the
L1, with the exception of f1 and f2 which are
more pronounced in Korean and Russian speak-
ers, and of f3 which seems completely absent
from French, German and Spanish which all have
articles. The exception is Greek which has articles
but uses bare nominals in predicative structures.
However, a more systematic pattern is revealed
when relations with MD errors are considered (us-
ing the Feature?Error relations and Errors by de-
creasing frequency components for different L1s).
As shown in Table 3, there is a sharp contrast be-
tween L1s with articles (French, German, Spanish
and Greek) and those without (Turkish, Japanese,
Korean, Russian, Chinese), which further sup-
ports our hypothesis. A further question is why
only the singular article is implicated in this fea-
ture. The association with predicative contexts
may provide a clue. Such contexts select nomi-
nals which require the indefinite article only in the
singular case; compare Unix is (a) very powerful
system with Macs are very elegant machines.
In sum, navigating the UI, we formed some
initial interpretations for why a particular feature
is negatively discriminative. In particular, nomi-
nals with complex adjectival phrases appear par-
ticularly susceptible to article omission errors by
learners of English with L1s lacking articles. The
example illustrates not just the usefulness of visu-
alisation techniques for navigating and interpret-
ing large amounts of data, but, more generally
the relevance of features weighted by discrimina-
tive classifiers. Despite being superficial in their
structure, POS ngrams can pick up syntactic envi-
ronments linked to particular phenomena. In this
case, the features do not just identify a high rate of
article omission errors, but, importantly, a partic-

5 Previous work
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first at-
tempt to visually analyse as well as perform a
linguistic interpretation of discriminative features
that characterise learner English.
Collins (2010) in his dissertation addresses vi-
sualisation for NLP research. The Bubble Sets vi-
sualisation draws secondary set relations around
arbitrary collections of items, such as a linguis-
tic parse tree. VisLink provides a general plat-
form within which multiple visualisations of lan-
guage (e.g., a force-directed graph and a radial
graph) can be connected, cross-queried and com-
pared. Moreover, he explores the space of content
analysis. DocuBurst is an interactive visualisation
of document content, which spatially organizes
words using an expert-created ontology (e.g.,
WordNet). Parallel Tag Clouds combine keyword
extraction and coordinated visualisations to pro-
vide comparative overviews across subsets of a
faceted text corpus. Recently, Rohrdantz et al
(2011) proposed a new approach to detecting and
investigating changes in word senses by visually
modelling and plotting aggregated views about
the diachronic development in word contexts.
Visualisation techniques have been success-
fully used in other areas including the humanities
(e.g., Plaisant et al (2006) and Don et al (2007)),
as well as genomics (e.g., Meyer et al (2010a)
and Meyer et al (2010b)). For example, Meyer
41
et al (2010a) present a system that supports the
inspection and curation of data sets showing gene
expression over time, in conjunction with the spa-
tial location of the cells where the genes are ex-
pressed.
Graph layouts have been effectively used in
the analysis of domains such as social networks
(e.g., terrorism network) to allow for a system-
atic exploration of a variety of Social Network
Analysis measures (e.g., Gao et al (2009) and
Perer and Shneiderman (2006)). Heer and Boyd
(2005) have implemented Vizster, a visualisation
system for the exploration of on-line social net-
works (e.g., facebook) designed to facilitate the
discovery of people, promote awareness of com-
munity structure etc. Van Ham et al (2009) intro-
duce Phrase Net, a system that analyses unstruc-
tured text by taking as input a predefined pattern
and displaying a graph whose nodes are words
and whose edges link the words that are found as
matches.
We believe our integration of highly-weighted
discriminative features identified by a supervised
classifier into a graph-based visualiser to support
linguistic SLA research is, however, novel.
6 Conclusions
We have demonstrated how a data-driven ap-
proach to learner corpora can support SLA re-
search when guided by discriminative features
and augmented with visualisation tools. We de-
scribed a visual UI which supports exploratory
search over a corpus of learner texts using di-
rected graphs of features, and presented a case
study of how the system allows SLA researchers
to investigate the data and form hypotheses about
intermediate level learners. Although the use-
fulness of the EP visualiser should be con-
firmed through more rigorous evaluation tech-
niques, such as longitudinal case studies (Shnei-
derman and Plaisant, 2006; Munzner, 2009) with
a broad field of experts, these initial explorations
are encouraging. One of the main advantages of
using visualisation techniques over command-line
database search tools is that SLA researchers can
start developing and testing hypotheses without
the need to learn a query syntax first.
We would also like to point out that we adopted
a user-driven development of the visualiser based
on the needs of the third author, an SLA re-
searcher who acted as a design partner during
the development of the tool and was eager to use
and test it. There were dozens of meetings over
a period of seven months, and the feedback on
early interfaces was incorporated in the version
described here. After the prototype reached a sat-
isfactory level of stability, the final version overall
felt enjoyable and inviting, as well as allowed her
to form hypotheses and draw on different types of
evidence in order to substantiate it (Alexopoulou
et al, 2012). Future work will include the devel-
opment, testing and evaluation of the UI with a
wider range of users, as well as be directed to-
wards investigation and evaluation of different vi-
sualisation techniques of machine learned or ex-
tracted features that support hypothesis formation
about learner grammars.
