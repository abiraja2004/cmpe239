Abstract
Conversational participants tend to immedi-
ately and unconsciously adapt to each other?s
language styles: a speaker will even adjust the
number of articles and other function words in
their next utterance in response to the number
in their partner?s immediately preceding utter-
ance. This striking level of coordination is
thought to have arisen as a way to achieve so-
cial goals, such as gaining approval or empha-
sizing difference in status. But has the adap-
tation mechanism become so deeply embed-
ded in the language-generation process as to
become a reflex? We argue that fictional di-
alogs offer a way to study this question, since
authors create the conversations but don?t re-
ceive the social benefits (rather, the imagined
characters do). Indeed, we find significant co-
ordination across many families of function
words in our large movie-script corpus. We
also report suggestive preliminary findings on
the effects of gender and other features; e.g.,
surprisingly, for articles, on average, charac-
ters adapt more to females than to males.
1 Introduction
?...it is dangerous to base any sociolinguistic argu-
mentation on the evidence of language in fictional
texts only? (Bleichenbacher (2008), crediting Mare?
(2000))
The chameleon effect is the ?nonconscious
mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, facial expres-
sions, and other behaviors of one?s interaction part-
ners? (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999).1 For exam-
ple, if one conversational participant crosses their
1The term is a reference to the movie Zelig, wherein a ?hu-
arms, their partner often unconsciously crosses their
arms as well. The effect occurs for language, too,
ranging from matching of acoustic features such as
accent, speech rate, and pitch (Giles et al, 1991;
Chartrand and van Baaren, 2009) to lexico-syntactic
priming across adjacent or nearby utterances (Bock,
1986; Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Ward and Lit-
man, 2007; Reitter et al, 2011).
Our work focuses on adjacent-utterance coordina-
tion with respect to classes of function words. To ex-
emplify the phenomenon, we discuss two short con-
versations.
? First example: The following exchange from the
movie ?The Getaway? (1972) demonstrates quanti-
fier coordination.
Doc: At least you were outside.
Carol: It doesn?t make much difference where you are [...]
Note that ?Carol? used a quantifier, one that is differ-
ent than the one ?Doc? employed. Also, notice that
?Carol? could just as well have replied in a way that
doesn?t include a quantifier, for example, ?It doesn?t
really matter where you are...?.
? Second example: Levelt and Kelter (1982) report
an experiment involving preposition coordination.
Shopkeepers who were called and asked ? At what
time does your shop close?? were significantly more
likely to say ? At five o?clock? than ?five o?clock?.2
man chameleon? uncontrollably takes on the characteristics of
those around him. The term is meant to contrast with ?aping?,
a word connoting intentional imitation.
Related terms include adaptation, alignment, entrainment,
priming, and Du Bois? dialogic syntax.
2This is an example of lexical matching manifested as part
of syntactic coordination.
76
Coordination of function-word class has been pre-
viously documented in several settings (Niederhof-
fer and Pennebaker, 2002; Taylor and Thomas,
2008; Ireland et al, 2011; Gonzales et al, 2010),
the largest-scale study being on Twitter (Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al, 2011).
Problem setting People don?t consciously track
function words (Levelt and Kelter, 1982; Segalowitz
and Lane, 2004; Petten and Kutas, 1991) ? it?s not
easy to answer the question, ?how many preposi-
tions were there in the sentence I just said??. There-
fore, it is quite striking that humans nonetheless in-
stantly adapt to each other?s function-word rates. In-
deed, there is active debate regarding what mecha-
nisms cause nonconscious coordination (Ireland et
al., 2011; Branigan et al, 2010).
One line of thought is that convergence represents
a social strategy3 whose aim is to gain the other?s so-
cial approval (Giles, 2008; Street and Giles, 1982)
or enhance the other?s comprehension (Clark, 1996;
Bortfeld and Brennan, 1997).4 This hypothesis is
supported by studies showing that coordination is af-
fected by a number of social factors, including rel-
ative social status (Natale, 1975; Gregory and Web-
ster, 1996; Thakerar et al, 1982) and gender role
(Bilous and Krauss, 1988; Namy et al, 2002; Ire-
land and Pennebaker, 2010).
But an important question is whether the adap-
tation mechanism has become so deeply embed-
ded in the language-generation process as to have
transformed into a reflex not requiring any social
triggering.5 Indeed, it has been argued that un-
conscious mimicry is partly innate (Chartrand and
Bargh, 1999), perhaps due to evolutionary pressure
to foster relationships (Lakin et al, 2003).
To answer this question, we take a radical ap-
proach: we consider a setting in which the per-
sons generating the coordinating dialog are different
from those engaged in the dialog (and standing to
reap the social benefits) ? imagined conversations,
specifically, scripted movie dialogs.
3In fact, social signaling may also be the evolutionary cause
of chameleons? color-changing ability (Stuart-Fox et al, 2008).
4For the purpose of our discussion, we are conflating social-
approval and audience-design hypotheses under the category of
social strategy.
5This hypothesis relates to characterizations of alignment as
an unmediated mechanism (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).
Life is beautiful, but cinema is paradise A pri-
ori, it is not clear that movie conversations would ex-
hibit convergence. Dialogs between movie charac-
ters are not truthful representations of real-life con-
versations. They often are ?too carefully polished,
too rhythmically balanced, too self-consciously art-
ful? (Kozloff, 2000), due to practical and artis-
tic constraints and scriptwriting practice (McKee,
1999). For example, mundane phenomena such as
stuttering and word repetitions are generally nonex-
istent on the big screen. Moreover, writers have
many goals to accomplish, including the need to ad-
vance the plot, reveal character, make jokes as funny
as possible, and so on, all incurring a cognitive load.
So, the question arises: do scripted movie di-
alogs, in spite of this quasi-artificiality and the
aforementioned generation/engagement gap, exhibit
the real-life phenomenon of stylistic convergence?
When imagining dialogs, do scriptwriters (noncon-
sciously6) adjust the respondent?s replies to echo the
initiator?s use of articles, prepositions, and other ap-
parently minor aspects of lexical choice? According
to our results, this is indeed the case, which has fas-
cinating implications.
First, this provides evidence that coordination, as-
sumed to be driven by social motivations, has be-
come so deeply embedded into our ideas of what
conversations ?sound like? that the phenomenon oc-
curs even when the person generating the dialog is
not the recipient of the social benefits.7
Second, movies can be seen as a controlled en-
vironment in which preconceptions about the rela-
tion between communication patterns and the social
features of the participants can be studied. This
gives us the opportunity to understand how people
(scriptwriters) nonconsciously expect convergence
to relate to factors such as gender, status and rela-
tion type. Are female characters thought to accom-
modate more to male characters than vice-versa?
Furthermore, movie scripts constitute a corpus
that is especially convenient because meta-features
6The phenomenon of real-life language convergence is not
widely known among screenplay authors (Beth F. Milles, pro-
fessor of acting and directing, personal communication).
7Although some writers may perhaps imagine themselves
"in the shoes" of the recipients, recall that authors generally
don?t include in their scripts the repetitions and ungrammati-
calities of "real-life" speech.

like gender can be more or less readily obtained.
Contributions We check for convergence in a
corpus of roughly 250,000 conversational exchanges
from movie scripts (available at http://www.
cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/movies).
Specifically, we examine the set of nine families of
stylistic features previously utilized by Ireland et
al. (2011), and find a statistically significant con-
vergence effect for all these families. We thereby
provide evidence that language coordination is so
implanted within our conception of conversational
behavior that, even if such coordination is socially
motivated, it is exhibited even when the person
generating the language in question is not receiving
any of the presumed social advantages.
We also study the effects of gender, narrative im-
portance, and hostility. Intriguingly, we find that
these factors indeed ?affect? movie characters? lin-
guistic behavior; since the characters aren?t real,
and control of stylistic lexical choice is largely non-
conscious, the effects of these factors can only be
springing from patterns existing in the scriptwriters?
minds.
Our findings, by enhancing our understanding of
linguistic adaptation effects in stylistic word choice
and its relation to various socially relevant factors,
may in the future aid in practical applications. Such
an understanding would give us insight into how
and what kinds of language coordination yield more
satisfying interactions ? convergence has been al-
ready shown to enhance communication in organiza-
tional contexts (Bourhis, 1991), psychotherapy (Fer-
rara, 1991), care of the mentally disabled (Hamilton,
1991), and police-community interactions (Giles et
al., 2007). Moreover, a deeper understanding can aid
human-computer interaction by informing the con-
struction of natural-language generation systems,
since people are often more satisfied with encoun-
ters exhibiting appropriate linguistic convergence
(Bradac et al, 1988; van Baaren et al, 2003), even
when the other conversational participant is known
to be a computer (Nass and Lee, 2000; Branigan et
al., 2010).

Linguistic style and human characteristics Us-
ing stylistic (i.e., non-topical) elements like arti-
cles and prepositions to characterize the utterer in
some way has a long history, including in author-
ship attribution (Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Juola,
2008), personality-type classification (Argamon et
al., 2005; Oberlander and Gill, 2006; Mairesse et al,
2007), gender categorization (Koppel et al, 2002;
Mukherjee and Liu, 2010; Herring and Paolillo,
2006), identification of interactional style (Jurafsky
et al, 2009; Ranganath et al, 2009), and recognizing
deceptive language (Hancock et al, 2008; Mihalcea
and Strapparava, 2009).
Imagined conversations There has been work in
the NLP community applying computational tech-
niques to fiction, scripts, and other types of text
containing imagined conversations. For example,
one recent project identifies conversational networks
in novels, with the goal of evaluating various liter-
ary theories (Elson et al, 2010; Elson and McKe-
own, 2010). Movie scripts were used as word-sense-
disambiguation evaluation data as part of an effort
to generate computer animation from the scripts (Ye
and Baldwin, 2006). Sonderegger (2010) employed
a corpus of English poetry to study the relation-
ship between pronunciation and network structure.
Rayson et al (2001) computed part-of-speech fre-
quencies for imaginative writing in the British Na-
tional Corpus, finding a typology gradient progress-
ing from conversation to imaginative writing (e.g.,
novels) to task-oriented speech to informative writ-
ing. The data analyzed by Oberlander and Gill
(2006) consisted of emails that participants were in-
structed to write by imagining that they were going
to update a good friend on their current goings-on.
3 Movie dialogs corpus
To address the questions raised in the introduc-
tion, we created a large set of imagined conver-
sations, starting from movie scripts crawled from
various sites.8 Metadata for conversation analy-
sis and duplicate-script detection involved mostly-
automatic matching of movie scripts with the IMDB
movie database; clean-up resulted in 617 unique ti-
tles tagged with genre, release year, cast lists, and

IMDB information. We then extracted 220,579
conversational exchanges between pairs of charac-
ters engaging in at least 5 exchanges, and auto-
matically matched these characters to IMDB to re-
trieve gender (as indicated by the designations ?ac-
tor? or ?actress?) and/or billing-position information
when possible (?9000 characters, ?3000 gender-
identified and ?3000 billing-positioned). The latter
feature serves as a proxy for narrative importance:
the higher up in the credits, the more important the
character tends to be in the film.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
dataset of (metadata-rich) imaginary conversations
to date.
4 Measuring linguistic style
For consistency with prior work, we employed the
nine LIWC-derived categories (Pennebaker et al,
2007) deemed by Ireland et al (2011) to be pro-
cessed by humans in a generally non-conscious fash-
ion. The nine categories are: articles, auxiliary
verbs, conjunctions, high-frequency adverbs, im-
personal pronouns, negations, personal pronouns,
prepositions, and quantifiers (451 lexemes total).
It is important to note that language coordination
is multimodal: it does not necessarily occur simulta-
neously for all features (Ferrara, 1991), and speakers
may converge on some features but diverge on others
(Thakerar et al, 1982); for example, females have
been found to converge on pause frequency with
male conversational partners but diverge on laugh-
ter (Bilous and Krauss, 1988).
5 Measuring convergence
Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002) use the correla-
tion coefficient to measure accommodation with re-
spect to linguistic style features. While correlation
at first seems reasonable, it has some problematic as-
pects in our setting (we discuss these problems later)
that motivate us to employ an alternative measure.
We instead use a convergence measure introduced
in Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al (2011) that quan-
tifies how much a given feature family t serves as an
immediate trigger or stimulus, meaning that one per-
son?s utterance exhibiting such a feature triggers the
appearance of that feature in the respondent?s imme-
diate reply.
For example, we might be studying whether one
person A?s inclusion of articles in an utterance trig-
gers the usage of articles in respondent B?s reply.
Note that this differs from asking whether B uses ar-
ticles more often when talking to A than when talk-
ing to other people (it is not so surprising that peo-
ple speak differently to different audiences). This
also differs from asking whether B eventually starts
matching A?s behavior in later utterances within the
same conversation. We specifically want to know
whether each utterance by A triggers an immediate
change in B?s behavior, as such instantaneous adap-
tation is what we consider the most striking aspect
of convergence, although immediate and long-term
coordination are clearly related.
We now describe the statistic we employ to mea-
sure the extent to which person B accommodates to
A. Consider an arbitrary conversational exchange
started by A, and let a denote A?s initiating utterance
and b??a denote B?s reply to a.9 Note that we use
lowercase to emphasize when we are talking about
individual utterances rather than all the utterances of
the particular person, and that thus, the arrow in b??a
indicates that we mean the reply to the specific sin-
gle utterance a. Let at be the indicator variable for a
exhibiting t, and similarly for bt??a. Then, we define
the convergence ConvA,B(t) of B to A as:
P (bt??a = 1|a
t = 1)? P (bt??a = 1). (1)
Note that this quantity can be negative (indicating
divergence). The overall degree Conv(t) to which t
serves as a trigger is then defined as the expectation
of ConvA,B(t) over all initiator-respondent pairs:
Conv(t)
def
= Epairs(A,B)(ConvA,B(t)). (2)
Comparison with correlation: the importance
of asymmetry10 Why do we employ ConvA,B ,
Equation (1), instead of the well-known correlation
coefficient? One reason is that correlation fails to
9We use ?initiating? and ?reply? loosely: in our terminology,
the conversation ?A: ?Hi.? B: ?Eaten?? A: ?Nope.?? has two
exchanges, one initiated by A?s ?Hi?, the other by B?s ?Eaten??.
10Other asymmetric measures based on conditional prob-
ability of occurrence have been proposed for adaptation
within monologues (Church, 2000) and between conversations
(Stenchikova and Stent, 2007). Since our focus is different, we
control for different factors.
79
capture an important asymmetry. The case where
at = 1 but bt??a = 0 represents a true failure to ac-
commodate; but the case where at = 0 but bt??a = 1
should not, at least not to the same degree. For ex-
ample, a may be very short (e.g., ?What??) and thus
not contain an article, but we don?t assume that this
completely disallows B from using articles in their
reply. In other words, we are interested in whether
the presence of t acts as a trigger, not in whether
b??a exhibits t if and only if a does, the latter being
what correlation detects.11
It bears mentioning that since at and bt??a are
binary, a simple calculation shows that the covari-
ance12 cov(at, bt??a) = ConvA,B(t) ? P (a
t = 1).
But, the two terms on the right hand side are
not independent: raising P (at = 1) could cause
ConvA,B(t) to decrease by affecting the first term
in its definition, P (bt??a = 1|a
t = 1) (see eq. 1).
6 Experimental results
6.1 Convergence exists in fictional dialogs
For each ordered pair of characters (A,B) and for
each feature family t, we estimate equation (1) in a
straightforward manner: the fraction of B?s replies
to t-manifesting A utterances that themselves ex-
hibit t, minus the fraction of all replies of B to A
that exhibit t.13 Fig. 1 compares the average values
of these two fractions (as a way of putting conver-
gence values into context), showing positive differ-
ences for all of the considered families of features
(statistically significant, paired t-test p < 0.001); this
demonstrates that movie characters do indeed con-
verge to each other?s linguistic style on all consid-
ered trigger families.14
11One could also speculate that it is easier for B to (uncon-
sciously) pick up on the presence of t than on its absence.
12The covariance of two random variables is their correlation
times the product of their standard deviations.
13For each t, we discarded pairs of characters where some
relevant count is < 10, e.g., where B had fewer than 10 replies
manifesting the trigger.
14We obtained the same qualitative results when measuring
convergence via the correlation coefficient, doing so for the sake
of comparability with prior work (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker,
2002; Taylor and Thomas, 2008).

All differences are statistically significant (paired t-test).
In all figures in this paper, error bars represent standard
error, estimated via bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).
(Here, the error bars, in red, are very tight.)
Movies vs. Twitter One can ask how our results
on movie dialogs correspond to those for real-life
conversations. To study this, we utilize the results
of Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al (2011) on a large-
scale collection of Twitter exchanges as data on
real conversational exchanges. Figure 2 depicts the
comparison, revealing two interesting effects. First,
Twitter users coordinate more than movie characters
on all the trigger families we considered, which does
show that the convergence effect is stronger in actual
interchanges. On the other hand, from the perspec-
tive of potentially using imagined dialogs as prox-
ies for real ones, it is intriguing to see that there is
generally a correspondence between how much con-
vergence occurs in real dialogs for a given feature
family and how much convergence occurs for that
feature in imagined dialogs, although conjunctions
and articles show a bit less convergence in fictional

Adjacent
Non-adjacent
Figure 3: Immediate vs. within-conversation effects
(for conversations with at least 5 utterances). Sup-
pose that we have a conversation a1 b2 a3 b4 a5 . . .. The
lefthand/dark-green bars show the usual convergence
measure, which involves the utterance pair a1 and b2. The
righthand/mustard-green bars show convergence based
on pairs like a1 and b4 ? utterances in the same con-
versation, but not adjacent. We see that there is a much
stronger triggering effect for immediately adjacent utter-
ances.
exchanges than this pattern would suggest.
6.2 Potential alternative explanations
Immediate vs. within-conversation effects An
additional natural question is, how much are these
accommodation effects due to an immediate trigger-
ing effect, as opposed to simply being a by-product
of utterances occurring within the same conversa-
tion? For instance, could the results be due just to
the topic of the conversation?
To answer this question requires measuring ?con-
vergence? between utterances that are not adjacent,
but are still in the same conversation. To this end,
we first restricted attention to those conversations
in which there were at least five utterances, so that
they would have the structure a1 b2 a3 b4 a5.... We
then measure convergence not between adjacent ut-
terances, like a1 and b2, but where we skip an utter-
ance, such as the pair a1, b4 or b2, a5. This helps
control for topic effects, since b4 and a1 are still
close and thus fairly likely to be on the same sub-
ject.15
Figure 3 shows that the level of convergence al-
ways falls off after the skipped utterance, sometimes
dramatically so, thus demonstrating that the level
of immediate adaptation effects we see cannot be
solely explained by the topic of conversation or other
conversation-level effects. These results accord with
the findings of Levelt and Kelter (1982), where in-
terposing ?interfering? questions lowered the chance
of a question?s preposition being echoed by the re-
spondent, and Reitter et al (2006), where the effects
of structural priming were shown to decay quickly
with the distance between the priming trigger and
the priming target.
Towards the same end, we also performed ran-
domization experiments in which we shuffled the or-
der of each participant?s utterances in each conversa-
tion, while maintaining alternation between speak-
ers. We again observed drop-offs in this randomized
condition in comparison to immediate convergence,
the main focus of this paper.
Self-coordination Could our results be explained
entirely by the script author converging to their own
self, given that self-alignment has been documented
15It is true that they might be on different topics, but in fact
even b2 might be on a different subject from a1.
81
(Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Reitter et al, 2006)?
If that were the case, then the characters that the au-
thor is writing about should converge to themselves
no more than they converge to different characters.
But we ran experiments showing that this is not the
case, thus invalidating this alternative hypothesis. In
fact, characters converge to themselves much more
than they converge to other characters.
6.3 Convergence and imagined relation
We now analyze how convergence patterns vary with
the type of relationship between the (imagined) par-
ticipants. Note that, given the multimodal charac-
ter of convergence, treating each trigger family sep-
arately is the most appropriate way to proceed, since
in past work, for the same experimental factor (e.g.,
gender), different features converge differently (re-
fer back to ?4). For clarity of exposition, we discuss
in detail only the results for the Articles feature fam-
ily; but the results for all trigger families are sum-
marized in Fig. 7, discussed later.
Imagined gender Fig. 4(a) shows how conver-
gence on article usage depends on the gender of the
initiator and respondent. Females are more influ-
ential than males: movie characters of either gen-
der accommodate more to female characters than to
male characters (compare the Female initiator bar
with the Male initiator bar, statistically significant,
independent t-test, p < 0.05). Also, female char-
acters seem to accommodate slightly more to other
characters than male characters do (though not sta-
tistically significantly so in our data).
We also compare the amount of convergence be-
tween all the possible types of gendered initiator-
respondent pairs involved (Fig. 4(b)). One can ob-
serve, for example, that male characters adapt less in
same-gender situations (Male-Male conversations)
than in mixed-gender situations (Female initiator-
Male respondent), while the opposite is true for fe-
male characters (Female-Female vs. Male-Female).
Interpreting these results lies beyond the scope
of this paper. We note that these results could be
a correlate of many factors, such as the roles that
male and female characters are typically assigned in
movie scripts.16
16A comparison to previously reported results on real-life
gender effects is not straightforward, since they pertain to differ-
Narrative importance Does the relative impor-
tance bestowed by the scriptwriter to the characters
affect the amount of linguistic coordination he or she
(nonconsciously) embeds in their dialogs? Fig. 5
shows that, on average, the lead character converges
to the second-billed character more than vice-versa
(compare left bar in 1st resp. group with left bar in
2nd resp. group).
One possible confounding factor is that there is
significant gender imbalance in the data (82% of all
lead characters are males, versus only 51% of the
secondary characters). Could the observed differ-
ence be a direct consequence of the relation between
gender and convergence discussed above? The an-
swer is no: the same qualitative observation holds if
we restrict our analysis to same-gender pairs (com-
pare the righthand bars in each group in Fig. 517).
It would be interesting to see whether these re-
sults could be brought to bear on previous results
regarding the relationship between social status and
convergence, but such interpretation lies beyond the
scope of this paper, since the connection between
billing order and social status is not straightforward.
Quarreling The level of contention in conversa-
tions has also been shown to be related to the amount
of convergence (Giles, 2008; Niederhoffer and Pen-
nebaker, 2002; Taylor and Thomas, 2008). To test
whether this tendency holds in the case of imagined
conversations, as a small pilot study, we manually
classified the conversations between 24 main pairs
of characters from romantic comedies18 as: quarrel-
ing, some quarreling and no quarreling. Although
the experiment was too small in scale to provide
statistical significance, the results (Fig. 6) suggest
that indeed the level of convergence is affected by
ent features; Ireland and Pennebaker (2010) show that females
match their linguistic style more than males, where style match-
ing is averaged over the same 9 trigger families we employ (they
do not report gender effect for each family separately).
17Figure 5 also shows that our convergence measure does
achieve negative values in practice, indicating divergence. Di-
vergence is a rather common phenomenon which deserves at-
tention in future work; see Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al
(2011) for an account.
18We chose the romantic comedy genre since it is often char-
acterized by some level of contention between the two people
in the main couple.

Figure 7: Summary of the relation between convergence and imagined gender (a and b), billing order (c), and quarrel-
ing (d). The bars represent the difference between the convergence observed in the respective cases; e.g., the Article
(red) bar in (a) represents the difference between the F resp. and the M resp. bars in Fig. 4(a). In each plot, the
trigger families are sorted according to the respective difference, but the color assigned to each family is consistent
across plots. The scale of (d) differs from the others.
the presence of controversy: quarreling exhibited
considerably more convergence for articles than the
other categories (the same holds for personal and in-
definite pronouns; see Fig. 7). Interestingly, the
reverse is true for adverbs; there, we observe di-
vergence for contentious conversations and conver-
gence for non-contentious conversations (detailed
plot omitted due to space constraints). This corre-
sponds to Niederhoffer and Pennebaker?s (2002) ob-
servations made on real conversations in their study
of the Watergate transcripts: when the relationship
between the two deteriorated, Richard Nixon con-
verged more to John Dean on articles, but diverged
on other features.19
Results for the other features Our results above
suggest some intriguing interplay between conver-
gence and gender, status, and level of hostility in
imagined dialogs, which may shed light on how
people (scriptwriters) nonconsciously expect con-
19Adverbs were not included in their study.

vergence to relate to such factors. (Interpreting these
sometimes apparently counterintuitive findings is
beyond the scope of this paper, but represents a fas-
cinating direction for future work.) Fig. 7 shows
how the nature of these relations depends on the trig-
ger family considered. The variation among families
is in line with the previous empirical results on the
multimodality of convergence in real conversations,
as discussed in ?4.
7 Summary and future work
We provide some insight into the causal mecha-
nism behind convergence, a topic that has gener-
ated substantial scrutiny and debate for over 40 years
(Ireland et al, 2011; Branigan et al, 2010). Our
work, along with Elson and McKeown (2010), ad-
vocates for the value of fictional sources in the study
of linguistic and social phenomena. To stimulate
such studies, we render our metadata-rich corpus of
movie dialog public.
In ?1, we described some practical applications
of a better understanding of the chameleon effect in
language; it boils down to improving communica-
tion both between humans and between humans and
computers. Also, our results on contention could

be used to further automatic controversy detection
(Mishne and Glance, 2006; G?mez et al, 2008).
Moreover, if we succeeded in linking our results
on narrative importance to relative social status, we
might further the development of systems that can
infer social relationships in online social networks
when conversational data is present but other, more
explicit cues are absent (Wyatt et al, 2008; Bram-
sen et al, 2011). Such systems could be valuable to
the rapidly expanding field of analyzing social net-
works.
