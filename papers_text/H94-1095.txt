PROJECT GOALS 
Our research focuses on the identification of word usage con- 
straints fi'om large text corpora. Such constraints are useful 
both for the problem of selecting vocabulary for language 
generation and for disambiguating lexical meaning in inter- 
pretation. We are developing systems that can automatically 
extract such constraints from corpora nd empirical methods 
for analyzing text. Identified constraints will be represented 
in a lexicon that will be tested computationally aspart of a 
natural language system. We are also identifying lexical con- 
straints for machine translation using the aligned Hansard cor- 
pus as training data and are identifying many-to-many word 
alignments. 
One primary class of constraints we are examining is lexical; 
that is, constraints on word usage arriving from collocations 
(word pairs or phrases that commonly appear together). We 
are also looking at constraints deriving from domain scales 
which influence use of scalar adjectives and determiners, con- 
straints on temporal markers and tense, constraints on refer- 
ence over text, and constraints on cue words and phrases that 
may be used to convey explicit information about discourse 
structure. 
RECENT RESULTS 
? Licensed Xtract, a collocation extraction system with 
windows interface, to 26 sites, including 1 commercial 
site. 
? Completed implementation f a collocation translation 
system called Champollion, which uses an incremental, 
statistical lgorithm and ported Champollion from a DOS 
to Unix platform. 
, Evaluated Champollion using 3 human judges on 2 year's 
worth of Hansard's data, yielding an average of 77% 
accuracy on one year and 61% accuracy on the other 
with problems on the second set due to reference database 
corpus ize. 
? Developed a system that automatically extracts relevant 
data from text corpora nd corpora-based databases for 
linguistic tests proposed for determining which is the 
marked ement of a pair of antonymous adjectives. 
Assessed the statistical significance of the markedness re- 
suits, showing that some simple linguistic tests are good 
indicators of markedness, while others fail to perform 
well. We combined the tests using a smoothed log-linear 
regression model yielding a small, but statistically sig- 
nificant improvement. 
Using the results of a corpus analysis of automatically 
collected pairs of conjoined adjectives, designed a graph 
model to separate adjectives into sub-scales (positive and 
negative) according to the sub-graphs formed. 
Implemented and evaluated a genetic programming al- 
gorithm to induce decision trees for cue word disam- 
biguation based on lexical and part of speech data in a 
large text corpus. 
Analyzed istribution of NPs in Pear corpus of oral nar- 
ratives, leading to new, more comprehensive formulation 
of the factors correlated with definiteness. 
Analyzed co-occurrence data of 16 aspectual verbs in 
Brown corpus (e.g., 'begin', 'continue') to rank them by 
their ability to categorize aspectual class of their verb 
arguments. Six aspectual verbs account for 90% of the 
different verbs appearing as arguments. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
For collocation translation, we are continuing evaluation of 
Champollion, using several years worth of the Hansard as a 
reference corpus and testing on separate data. We will also 
investigate methods for including prepositions in the transla- 
tion algorithm. For scalar adjectives, we are implementing the 
graph model so that we can automatically partially order de- 
ments of groups of semantically related scalar adjectives that 
are produced by a program we implemented in earlier years. 
For analysis of aspectual verbs, we plan to compare aspectual 
data derived from Brown with similar data from a new corpus, 
or to integrate a supplementary classification method (e.g., use 
of independent semantic net) with the current distributional 
model.
