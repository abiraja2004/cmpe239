Abstract
LXGram is a hand-built Portuguese computational grammar based on
HPSG (syntax) and MRS (semantics). The LXGram system participated
in the STEP 2008 shared task which aims at comparing semantic repre-
sentations produced by NLP systems such as LXGram. Every partici-
pating team had to contribute a small text. The text that we submitted
for the shared task was originally in Portuguese (an excerpt from a news-
paper) and translated into English, to make a meaningful comparison at
the shared task possible. Likewise, the English texts contributed by the
other participating teams were translated into Portuguese. Because the
LXGram generates many different analyses (mainly due to PP attach-
ment ambiguities), the preferred analysis was selected manually. It was
required to extend LXGram?s lexicon and inventory of syntax rules to be
able to get a reasonable performance on the shared task data. Eventually,
our system was able to produce an analysis for 20 out of the 30 sentences
of the shared task data.

1 Introduction
This paper describes the participation of the Portuguese grammar LXGram in the
Shared Task of STEP 2008 ?Comparing Semantic Representations? (Bos, 2008). This
Shared Task was held in the University of Venice on 22?24 September 2008, with the
purpose of comparing semantic representations produced by different natural language
processing systems. This task had seven participating teams. Each team contributed
with a small text (up to five sentences long) to be processed by all the systems.
LXGram is a hand-built, general purpose computational grammar for the deep lin-
guistic processing of Portuguese. It is developed under the grammatical framework
of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987, 1994; Sag
et al, 2003) and uses Minimal Recursion Semantics, MRS (Copestake et al, 2005) for
the representation of meaning. This grammar implementation is undertaken with the
LKB (Copestake, 2002) grammar development environment and its evaluation and
regression testing is done via [incr tsdb()] (Oepen, 2001). It is also intended to be
compatible with the PET parser (Callmeier, 2000).
The LinGO Grammar Matrix (version 0.9), an open-source kit for the rapid devel-
opment of grammars based on HPSG and MRS, was used as the initial code upon
which to build LXGram. The grammar is implemented in the LKB using the T DL
formalism (Krieger and Sch?fer, 1994), based on unification and on typed feature
structures, and whose types are organized in a multiple inheritance hierarchy.
For more information, please refer to a detailed implementation report (Branco and
Costa, 2008a) or on pages 31?43 of this volume (Branco and Costa, 2008b). A free
version of the grammar can also be obtained at http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/lxgram,
under an ELDA research license.
Section 2 introduces the main features of the Minimal Recursion Semantics for-
mat, which is employed in the semantic representations produced by LXGram. In
Section 3, the sample text that the LXGram team submitted is described, together
with an explanation of the representations derived by the grammar. Finally, Section 4
discusses the results for the full data set of the Shared Task.
2 Semantic Formalism
In LXGram, semantic information is encoded following Minimal Recursion Seman-
tics (MRS) format for semantic representation (Copestake et al, 2005). MRS has
several properties that makes it an interesting semantic representation format from the
point of view of computational semantics.
Notoriously, it allows underspecification of the scope of relevant operators, which
permits that a sentence with scope ambiguities can be given a single, underspeci-
fied representation. For some applications, for instance machine translation between
closely related languages from the same language family, the underspecified repre-
sentations may be sufficient and bring the benefit of avoiding possible combinatorial
explosion into as many parses as readings.
In a nutshell, the underspecification of scope is achieved by associating every basic
relation to a handle (in the feature structure for a relation, the feature LBL encodes
this handle) and describing the constraints that hold between these handles (in the
feature HCONS, handle constraints). These constraints can be stated in a way such that
LXGram in the Shared Task ?Comparing Semantic Representations? 301
some scope resolution options are allowed while others are discarded. Nevertheless,
there may applications for which it may be important to get fully specified semantic
representations. In this case, MRS permits that the different scope possibilities be
computed on demand from the underspecified representation.
Also worth referring in this very brief presentation of the gist of MRS, it is the
representation of conjunction with the relative order of conjuncts underspecified, by
giving the same handle to the different conjuncts. This avoids computing associativity
and commutativity of conjunction in situations where spurious overgeneration may
arise.
Please consult Branco and Costa (2008a) in this volume (pages 31?43) for an ex-
ample illustrating quantifier scope ambiguities and underspecification. Due to space
limitations, it is not possible to provide further details on the MRS formalism here.
For the presentation of MRS, please consult Copestake et al (2005).

These sentences were adapted from newspaper text. We have chosen them because
they display interesting phenomena.
The semantic representations that LXGram produces for these sentences are pre-
sented at the Shared Task website http://www.sigsem.org. An example is included
in Appendix B. Several analyses are obtained for these examples (e.g. one of the sen-
tences got 540 parses), the main reason being PP attachment ambiguity. The semantic
representations we present are the ones associated to the preferred analyses, which
were selected manually.
Note that since the representations could not be displayed in a single page, the value
of the feature RELS was split across multiple pages. To ensure readability, the values
of the other features (LTOP, INDEX and HCONS) are repeated on every page pertaining
to the same representation.
Some comments are in order concerning these representations:
? The morphological person, number and gender are encoded as features (PER-
SON, NUMBER, GENDER) of the relevant index (quantified variable) that is
present there. For indices, the boolean feature DIV is also used, that shows
the value + for plurals and mass nouns.
? Event variables are included for the relations introduced by verbs, adjectives,
prepositions and adverbs (under their ARG0 feature). The morphological in-
formation on the verbs is also encoded as features of these events. This is the
purpose of the features MOOD, TENSE and ASPECT. There is also a feature
SF (sentence force) that represents whether a sentence denotes a proposition, a
question or a command. The feature ELLIPTICAL-PUNCT denotes whether the
sentence ends with an ellipsis (. . .) and is useful in order to constrain what is
generated by the grammar.
? There is a tense_rel relation associated to each verb form. Its ARG0 feature is
the same as the ARG0 of the verb it is associated with. The purpose of this extra
relation is to make an event variable present in the semantic representations for
the copular sentences where the relevant predicate is provided by a noun (none
of these examples). In such cases this event will contain the morphological
information of the copular verb.
? Note that the information about whether adjectives have intersective semantics
(see ?franc?s???French??in sentence (3)) or non-intersective semantics (see
LXGram in the Shared Task ?Comparing Semantic Representations? 303
?futuro???future??in sentence (5)) is visible in the corresponding semantic
representations.
The names of the predicates that correspond to lexical items of several classes
(common nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc.) follow a naming con-
vention that includes a lemma field, a part-of-speech field and an optional sense field
(often reflecting subcategorization). Table 1 lists the predicates present in these rep-
resentations and provides the corresponding English lemmas. There are other special
relations in these representations:
? udef_q_rel
the quantifier for bare NPs
? proper_q_rel
the quantifier for proper names
? tense_rel
associated to every verbal relation (see discussion above)
? named_rel
associated to proper names
? name-precedes_rel
associated to proper names
? string-equals_rel
equality between strings
? indef_q_rel
associated to some indefinites. In particular it is the quantifier used for NPs that
are introduced by elements that can also follow determiners (e.g. cardinals and
vague quantifiers like ?v?rios???several?)
? cardinal_rel
constrains the cardinality of the set denoted by the expression linked to its ARG1
feature
? greater-or-equal_rel
the integer in its ARG0 is greater than or equal to the integer in its ARG1 feature
? plus_rel
the integer in its ARG0 is the result of summing the two integers in the TERM0
and TERM1 features
? int-equals_rel
equality between integers
? ellipsis-or-generic_n_1_rel
placeholder relation when there are missing nouns

LXGram in the Shared Task ?Comparing Semantic Representations? 305
Sometimes some details of the semantic representations that are possible to obtain
depend on the features of the system where LXGram is developed and runs. In partic-
ular, for each feature that represents an argument of a relation (ARG0, ARG1, ARG2,
CARG, . . .), it must be stated in the configuration files whether it will contain a constant
(e.g. a string literal). For instance, we must say that the feature CARG always contains
a value, for visualization purposes. This fact sometimes constrains the display of the
semantic representations. It is the reason why the semantics for proper names and for
cardinals is more copious than what would seem necessary at first.
For instance, the semantics associated to ?7 pessoas? (?7 people?) in sentence (2)
is roughly ?x.cardinal_rel(e,_pessoa_n_rel(x), j1)? greater-or-equal_rel( j1, j2)?
int-equals( j2,7) (note that conjunction is denoted in MRS via identical labels for
relations). The information conveyed by the last two predicates could be simply given
by greater-or-equal_rel( j1,7). However, for that to display correctly we would have
to configure the system to display the second argument of the greater-or-equal_rel
relation as a constant. This will not always be the case: in the semantics for ?22? that
argument is the integer that is the result of summing ?20? and ?2? (number expressions
receive compositional semantics), represented with the help of the plus_rel relation.
The LKB does not allow one to compute arithmetic expressions.
These few sentences present some interesting problems for the computation of se-
mantic representation in general.
Typically, one is not able to resolve missing nouns, as this sometimes requires
access to pragmatic information. As a consequence, the semantics produced for sen-
tences with a missing noun (see sentence (5)) includes an ellipsis-or-generic_n_1_rel
instead of the relation corresponding to that noun.
Also, it is very hard if not impossible to recover missing arguments. See for in-
stance the semantics for the adjective ?semelhante? (?similar?) in sentence (3). The
missing argument is given the type r, instead of the type x of quantified variables, so
that we can omit a quantifier for it in the semantics and still be able to ask the system
for scoped solutions (the system would complain about free variables if these elements
were given the type x).
Finally, it is worth noting that there are some limitations of the semantic represen-
tations obtained given that the empirical coverage of the grammar is still in develop-
ment. Currently, the grammar does not make yet any distinction between restrictive
and non-restrictive relative clauses, as we have not focused on the fully-fledged im-
plementation of the semantics of non-restrictive relative clauses yet. This can be seen
in the semantics for the last example, where both relative clauses are semantically
combined with their head in the same way.
4 Performance in the Shared Task
There are seven small texts in the Shared Task. The sample text we submitted is text
4. We translated the other six texts into Portuguese before passing them to the system.
Translation of the Texts
The translations were done by the authors. We tried to make them as literal as possi-
ble in order to support comparability of the different systems taking part in the Shared
Task, but some bits were not literally translated as that would have produced unnatural
306 Branco and Costa
sentences. We also tried not to make the texts easy to parse by the system by simpli-
fying the texts in the translations. We present the translation for the texts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
and 7 in the Appendix A, with English glosses.
Initial Coverage
When we tried to parse the other six texts of the Shared Task, we got 0% coverage.
The causes for parse failure were missing words in the lexicon and missing syntactic
constructions.
Since the aim of the Shared Task is not to evaluate data coverage but rather to
compare the semantic representations output by different NLP systems, we made an
effort to expand LXGram by enlarging the lexicon and implementing some syntax
rules, with the purpose of producing semantic representations for as many sentences
in the Shared Task data as possible, within the time constraints.
During this grammar expansion, we tried not to tune the grammar to these particular
sentences. We tried to make the implementation of new phenomena general. For this
reason, some phenomena were not implemented deliberately, because we felt that we
would not be able to produce general solutions for them within the time limit. This is
the case of WH- questions (present in the first text), which are not yet supported by
LXGram and whose implementation we did not want to rush.
Grammar Expansion
We added 97 lexical entries to the grammar. For some of these items, we had to create
new lexical types, because they have subcategorization frames for which there was
still no lexical type in the grammar. One example is the noun ?pedido? (order), which
was implemented as having two arguments realized by prepositional phrases, the first
one headed ?de? and the second one headed by ?a?. LXGram already contained lex-
ical types for nouns with two arguments, but introduced by different prepositions.
Although these two arguments of the noun were not present in the example where
this noun occurs (the third sentence of text 3), we nevertheless created a new lexical
type for this subcategorization frame. We could have used an existing lexical type for
nouns with no complements and that particular sentence would have parsed fine, but
the predicate for that noun would not be a two-place predicate in the MRS represen-
tation. We added 10 new lexical types.
The constructions that were implemented in LXGram in order to parse these sen-
tences were:
? the progressive. In European Portuguese, the progressive is expressed via a
form of the verb ?estar? (to be) combined with an infinitive preceded by the
preposition ?a?.
? temporal expressions headed by the verb ?haver? (there to be). The temporal
expression for some time (second sentence of text 2) is expressed in Portuguese
as ?h? algum tempo? (literally: there is some time). The verb form cannot be
analyzed as a preposition, because this sort of expression is syntactically com-
positional. For instance, the verb inflects for tense (it can appear in the imper-
fect if the main verb of the clause is in a past tense) and there can be adverbs
modifying it to its right (?h? j? algum tempo?, there is already some time, i.e.
LXGram in the Shared Task ?Comparing Semantic Representations? 307
for some time now). We created a unary syntax rule that takes as daughter a
clause headed by this verb and produces a mother node with the syntactic char-
acteristics of a clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction and modifying
another clause. This rule adds a relation similar to a relation introduced by
a subordinating conjunction, and it?s called abstract-temporal_x_rel. We take
this relation as having the meaning of ?since?, but with the two arguments re-
versed, and the Portuguese clause for that is known for some time gets analyzed
as meaning roughly there is some time (some time has passed) since that is
known. That is a very literal semantic representation, but it allows us to keep
the semantic composition mechanism completely monotonic.
? the impersonal pronoun ?se?. The most naturally sounding translation of it was
suspected that (last sentence of text 5) is ?suspeitou-se que?, with a verb in the
active voice and its subject being realized by a clitic pronoun. This clitic has to
appear adjacently to the verb, which is atypical for subjects in Portuguese.
? NP appositives. We also implemented a rule to allow NP apposition. This was
because of sentences like the second sentence in text 6.
Additionally, a few preprocessor rules were expanded. For instance, sentences like
the last sentence of text 7 require integer literals to be considered as proper names. We
cannot create lexical entries for all integers, so we added preprocessor rules in order
to contemplate the possibility of integers as proper names.
Final Results
After grammar expansion, 20 sentences out of the 30 sentences in all the texts of the
Shared Task got an analysis. The sentences that could not be parsed are the following:
? Text 1: sentences (c) and (d).
? Text 5: sentences (a), (c) and (d)
? Text 6: all sentences
? Text 7: sentences (a) and (b)
The two sentences of text 1 that could not be parsed contain WH- questions, which
are currently not supported by the system.
The sentence (a) of text 5 could not be parsed because it contains two sentences as
the complement of a verb. LXGram cannot yet combine two independent sentences,
and we chose to not implement this possibility because the combination of an n-way
ambiguous sentence with another m-way ambiguous sentence would be n ? m-way
ambiguous.
The sentence (c) of the same text was not parsed because of a semantically vacuous
clitic (not implemented yet) and a relative clause modifying another clause (also not
covered). LXGram does not support sentence relatives and we chose not to imple-
ment them yet because, if the relative pronoun is filling a subject position (as in that
sentence), the verb has to allow for propositional subjects. In LXGram, we currently
only have subcategorization frames for verbs that take NPs as subjects, and we have
to review all lexical entries for verbs before we can parse that sentence.
308 Branco and Costa
For the remaining sentences without a parse, the reason was efficiency. Several of
the sentences in the Shared Task data translate to Portuguese sentences that are very
long (over 40 words) or have a very high number of prepositions, producing many
attachment possibilities. Note that we were doing exhaustive search. In many cases
the parser would run out of memory. In order to alleviate this problem, we used the
PET parser instead of the LKB parser for the longer sentences. PET is considerably
faster, because it is implemented in C (the LKB is in Lisp), and it precompiles the
grammar into a binary format. Also, the input to PET can be preprocessed by a POS
tagger, in order to reduce lexical ambiguity. We did this preprocessing for some of the
longer sentences.
However, PET dumps MRS representations as text, and choosing the best parse
from this sort of output is not practical, especially for sentences with many readings.
So we exported the results into a format that can be read by [ incr tsdb() ], a tool for
the management of test suites and corpora. With this tool, it is possible to choose
parses by choosing discriminants derived from all analyses. Choosing or rejecting a
single discriminant can eliminate a large number of analyses in one step. However,
[ incr tsdb() ] calls the LKB to reconstruct the trees based on the output of PET (which
includes the names of the rules used and syntactic constituency), when one wants to
choose the best parse. Even though the parse forest has already been built by the
PET parser, the LKB can still run out of memory when it is reconstructing the feature
structures if the number of analyses is sufficiently large (we had a sentence with over
18000 parses).
We also tried commenting out some rules that were not necessary to parse these
sentences, with the purpose of reducing the search space. Examples include robustness
rules, for parsing strings with no verb.
In the near future, we will be working on a stochastic disambiguation module,
which PET supports, in order to constrain the parser?s search space and to keep only
the best n parses, so that we can avoid the efficiency problems that we are facing at
the moment.
Analyses
The semantic representations for the sentences that LXGram parsed successfully are
presented in the appendix. As mentioned before, we performed exhaustive search. We
chose the best parse manually.
We used [ incr tsdb() ] associated to the LKB in order to choose the preferred
reading. After that we exported the MRS representation. The LKB exports LaTeX
directly. We edited the exported LaTeX in order to make the representations fit into
the pages of the appendix. This involved manually adding newlines and page breaks.
We also corrected characters with diacritics, which did not display correctly, and we
removed characterization information: after the name of each predicate, there is a
pair of character positions indicating the substring in the input spanned by the lexical
items or rules associated to that predicate; they were removed because they are not
interpretable by someone who does not know the implementation details, e.g. the
semantics for null subjects span the substring of the entire VP since this piece of
semantics is introduced by a unary rule that takes a VP as daughter.
LXGram in the Shared Task ?Comparing Semantic Representations? 309
Discussion of the Results
We would like to comment on some of the semantic representations obtained with
LXGram.
As we have pointed out before, some details of the semantics are not completely
independent of language. For an example, see the discussion above about temporal
expressions headed by the verb ?haver?.
MRS does not directly support a treatment of intentionality. For instance, sentence
(c) of text 2 contains an intentional context: it does not assert the existence of ?other
cancers caused by viruses?. There is no standard way of representing this sort of
intentionality with MRS.
Also, MRS does not support conjunction of quantifiers. There is no MRS equiva-
lent to a lambda expression like ?P.Quant1(x,P(x))?Quant2(y,P(y)). The usual MRS
representations associated with NP coordination have to include an explicit relation for
the truth function involved (but taking referential indices as arguments), as well as an
extra quantifier relation (the relation used in these cases is called ude f_q_rel, which
is also the name for the quantifier of bare NPs).
Some phenomena are difficult to analyze. An example is in sentence (c) of text 7.
In the Portuguese translation, we have two coordinated NPs at the end of the sentence
(the best sounding translation requires a determiner before each of the two nouns),
which are followed by a PP. The Portuguese translation interprets this PP as realizing
an argument of both nouns (cf. federal government interest and federal government
tax incentives). We could not get this reading, because we do not allow PP arguments
to attach higher than determiners. The analysis that we present leaves the first noun
with this argument underspecified, as this PP attaches directly to the second noun in
the corresponding syntax tree. This possibility of PP attachment seems to be required
for cases of NP coordination like this one, but it can be a source of overgeneration
for NPs that are not coordinated. This phenomenon affects other NP elements, like
adjective phrases, that can also take scope over a coordination of NPs. The current
implementation forces all noun dependents that have a restrictive interpretation to
attach lower than determiners, as that is the place where the restrictor of the quantifier
for that NP is visible in the feature structures.
