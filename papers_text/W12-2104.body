Abstract
We examine the response to the recent nat-
ural disaster Hurricane Irene on Twitter.com.
We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages re-
lating to Hurricane Irene from August 18th to
August 31st, 2011, and group them by loca-
tion and gender. We train a sentiment classi-
fier to categorize messages based on level of
concern, and then use this classifier to investi-
gate demographic differences. We report three
principal findings: (1) the number of Twit-
ter messages related to Hurricane Irene in di-
rectly affected regions peaks around the time
the hurricane hits that region; (2) the level of
concern in the days leading up to the hurri-
cane?s arrival is dependent on region; and (3)
the level of concern is dependent on gender,
with females being more likely to express con-
cern than males. Qualitative linguistic vari-
ations further support these differences. We
conclude that social media analysis provides
a viable, real-time complement to traditional
survey methods for understanding public per-
ception towards an impending disaster.
Introduction
In 2011, natural disasters cost the United States
more than 1,000 lives and $52 billion. The num-
ber of disasters costing over $1 billion in 2011
(twelve) is more than in the entire decade of the
1980s.1 As the number of people living in disaster-
prone areas grows, it becomes increasingly impor-
tant to have reliable, up-to-the-minute assessments
of emergency preparedness during impending disas-

cember 7, 2011.
ters. Understanding issues such as personal risk per-
ception, preparedness, and evacuation plans helps
public agencies better tailor emergency warnings,
preparations, and response.
Social scientists typically investigate these issues
using polling data. The research shows significant
demographic differences in response to government
warnings, personal risk assessment, and evacuation
decisions (Perry and Mushkatel, 1986; Perry and
Lindell, 1991; Goltz et al., 1992; Fothergill et al.,
1999; West and Orr, 2007; Enarson, 1998). For ex-
ample, Fothergill et al. (1999) find that minorities
differ in their risk perception and in their response to
emergency warnings, with some groups having fa-
talistic sentiments that lead to greater fear and less
preparedness. Goltz et al. (1992) find that people
with lower income and education, Hispanics, and
women all expressed greater fear of earthquakes.
This past research suggests governments could
benefit by tailoring their messaging and response to
address the variability between groups. While sur-
vey data have advanced our knowledge of these is-
sues, they have two major drawbacks for use in
disaster research. First, most surveys rely on re-
sponses to hypothetical scenarios, for example by
asking subjects if they would evacuate under cer-
tain scenarios. This hypothetical bias is well-known
(Murphy et al., 2005). Second, surveys are often im-
practical in disaster scenarios. In a rapidly-changing
environment, governments cannot wait for a time-
consuming survey to be conducted and the results
analyzed before making warning and response de-
cisions. Additionally, survey response rates shortly
before or after a disaster are likely to be quite low, as
citizens are either without power or are busy prepar-
ing or rebuilding. Thus, it is difficult to collect data
27
during the critical times immediately before and af-
ter the disaster.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
assessing public risk perception using social me-
dia analysis. Social media analysis has recently
been used to estimate trends of interest such as
stock prices (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2010), movie
sales (Asur and Huberman, 2010), political mood
(O?Connor et al., 2010a), and influenza rates (Lam-
pos and Cristianini, 2010; Culotta, 2010; Culotta,
2012). We apply a similar methodology here to as-
sess the public?s level of concern toward an impend-
ing natural disaster.
As a case study, we examine attitudes toward
Hurricane Irene expressed on Twitter.com. We col-
lect over 65,000 Twitter messages referencing Hur-
ricane Irene between August 18th and August 31st,
2011; and we train a sentiment classifier to annotate
messages by level of concern. We specifically look
at how message volume and sentiment varies over
time, location, and gender.
Our findings indicate that message volume in-
creases over the days leading up to the hurricane,
and then sharply decreases following its dispersal.
The timing of the increase and subsequent decrease
in messages differs based on the location relative to
the storm. There is also an increasing proportion of
concerned messages leading up to Hurricane Irene?s
arrival, which then decreases after Irene dissipation.
A demographic analysis of the proportion of con-
cerned messages shows significant differences both
by region and gender. The gender differences in par-
ticular are supported by previous survey results from
the social science literature (West and Orr, 2007).
These results suggest that social media analysis is a
viable technology for understanding public percep-
tion during a hurricane.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: First, we describe the data collection method-
ology, including how messages are annotated with
location and gender. Next, we present sentiment
classification experiments comparing various classi-
fiers, tokenization procedures, and feature sets. Fi-
nally, we apply this classifier to the entire message
set and analyze demographic variation in levels of
concern.
Data Collection
Irene became a tropical storm on August 20th, 2011,
and hit the east coast of the United States between
August 26th and 28th. This hurricane provides a
compelling case to investigate for several reasons.
First, Irene affected many people in many states,
meaning that regional differences in responses can
be investigated. Second, there was considerable me-
dia and political attention surrounding Hurricane
Irene, leading to it being a popular topic on social
network sites. Third, the fact that there was fore-
warning of the hurricane means that responses to it
can be evaluated over time.
Twitter is a social networking site that allows
users to post brief, public messages to their follow-
ers. Using Twitter?s API2, we can sample many mes-
sages as well as their meta-data, such as time, loca-
tion, and user name. Also, since Twitter can be used
on smart phones with batteries, power outages due
to natural disasters will presumably have less of an
effect on the volume of messages.
Using Twitter?s sampling API (?spritzer?), we
sample approximately uniformly from all messages
between August 18 and August 31. We then per-
form keyword filtering to collect messages contain-
ing the words ?Irene? or ?Hurricane?, or the hashtag
?#Irene?. During the period of August 18th to Au-
gust 31st, messages containing these keywords are
overwhelmingly related to Hurricane Irene and not
some other event. This results in 65,062 messages.
Inferring Location
In order to determine the location of the message
sender, we process the user-reported location data
from that user?s profile. Since not all users enter ac-
curate location data, we search for specific keywords
in order to classify the messages by state. For exam-
ple, if the location data contains a token ?VT? or
?Vermont,? it is labeled as coming from Vermont.
(See Appendix A for more details.) The locations
we consider are the 13 states directly affected by
Hurricane Irene, plus Washington DC. These loca-
tions are then grouped into 3 regions. First, the New
England region consists of the states of Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Ver-
mont, and Maine. Second, the Middle States region

posted during each hour.
consists of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylva-
nia. Third, the Upper South region consists of North
Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Wash-
ington DC.
Of the messages that we collect between Au-
gust 18th and August 31st, 15,721 are identified
as belonging to one of the directly affected areas.
Grouped into regions, we find that 2,424 are from
New England, 8,665 are from the Middle-States re-
gion, and 4,632 are from the Upper South region.
Figure 1 displays the messages per hour from
each of the three regions. The y-axis is normalized
over all messages from that region ? e.g., a value
of 0.02 for New England means that 2% of all mes-
sages from New England over the 10 day span were
posted in that hour. This allows us to see which time
periods were the most active for that region. Indeed,
we see that the spikes occur in geographical order
of the hurricane?s path, from the South, to the Mid-
Atlantic region, and finally New England. Addition-
ally, Figure 1 is marked with data points indicating
which events were occurring at that time.
There are several obvious limitations of this ap-
proach (as explored in Hecht et al. (2011)). For ex-
ample, users may enter false location information,
have an outdated profile, or may be posting mes-
sages from a different location. Assuming these is-
sues introduce no systemic bias, aggregate analyses
should not be significantly impacted (as supported
by the observed trends in Figure 1).
Inferring Gender
To determine the gender of the message sender, we
process the name field from the user?s profile ob-
tained from the Twitter API. The U.S. Census Bu-
reau provides a list of the most popular male and
female names in the United States. The lists con-
tain over 1,000 of the most common male names
and over 4,000 of the most common female names.
After removing names that can be either male or fe-
male (for example, Chris or Dana), we match the
first name of the user to the list of names obtained
from the census. Users that cannot be classified in
such a manner are labeled as unsure. The data con-
tains a total of 60,808 distinct users, of which 46%
are assigned a gender (of those, 55% are female,
45%male). We find that many of the unlabeled users
are news agencies. A similar methodology is used by
Mislove et al. (2011). As with geographic inference,

we make no attempt to model any errors introduced
by this process (e.g., users providing false names).
Table 1 displays statistics of the overall dataset. A
sample of 100 messages revealed no misattributed
location or gender information.
Sentiment Classification
In this section, we describe experiments applying
sentiment classification to assess the level of con-
cern of each message. Our goal is not to investigate
new sentiment classification techniques, but instead
to determine whether existing, well-known methods
are applicable to this domain. While there is an ex-
tensive literature in sentiment classification technol-
ogy (Pang and Lee, 2008), binary classification us-
ing a bag-of-words assumption has been shown to
provide a strong baseline, so that is the approach we
use here. We also evaluate the impact of lexicons and
tokenization strategies.
We define ?concerned? messages to be those
showing some degree of apprehension, fear, or gen-
eral concern regarding Hurricane Irene. Examples of
unconcerned messages include links to news reports
or messages expressing an explicit lack of concern.
The idea is to assess how seriously a particular group
is reacting to an impeding disaster.
To train the classifier, we sample 408 messages
from the 66,205 message collection and manually
annotate them as concerned or unconcerned. The fi-
nal training set contains 170 concerned messages.
Examples are shown in Table 2. To estimate inter-
annotator agreement, we had a second annotator
sample 100 labeled messages (50 concerned, 50
unconcerned) for re-annotation. The inter-annotator
agreement is 93% (Cohen?s kappa ? = .86).
Examples of concerned messages
wonderful, praying tht this hurricane goes
back out to sea.
Im actually scared for this hurricane...
This hurricane is freaking me out.
hope everyone is #safe during #irene

sages from the training set.
Tokenization and features
We train a simple bag-of-words classifier, where the
basic feature set is the list of word frequencies in
each message. Given the brevity and informality
of Twitter messages, tokenization choices can have
a significant impact on classification accuracy. We
consider two alternatives:
? Tokenizer0: The tokenizer of O?Connor et
al. (2010b), which does very little normaliza-
tion. Punctuation is preserved (for the purpose
of identifying semantics such as emoticons),
URLs remain intact, and text is lower-cased.
? Tokenizer1: A simple tokenizer that removes
all punctuation and converts to lowercase.
We also consider two feature pruning options:
? Stop Words: Remove words matching a list of
524 common English words.
? Frequency Pruning: Remove words occurring
fewer than 2 times in the labeled data.
We also consider the following features:
? Worry lexicon: We heuristically create a small
lexicon containing words expressing worry of
some kind, based on a brief review of the data.3
We replace all such tokens with a WORRIED
feature.
3The words are afraid, anxiety, cautious, die, died, nervous,
pray, prayers, prayin, praying, safe, safety, scared, scary, terri-
fied, thoughts, worried, worry, worrying

Table 3: Average accuracy (with standard error) and
micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 for the three sen-
timent classifiers, using their best configurations. The dif-
ference in accuracy between MaxEnt and the other clas-
sifiers is statistically significant (paired t-test, p < 0.01).
? Humor lexicon: Similarly, we create a small
lexicon containing words expressing humor.4
We replace all such tokens with a HUMOR
feature.
? Emoticon: Two common emoticons ?:)? and
?:(? are detected (prior to tokenization in the
case of Tokenizer 1).
Finally, we consider three classifiers: MaxEnt
(i.e., logistic regression), Naive Bayes, and a De-
cision Tree (ID3) classifier, as implemented in
the MALLET machine learning toolkit (McCallum,
2002). We use all the default settings, except we set
the maximum decision tree depth to 50 (after pre-
liminary results suggested that the default size of 4
was too small).
Enumerating the possible tokenization, features,
and classifier choices results in 192 possible sys-
tem configurations. For each configuration, 10-fold
cross-validation is performed on the labeled training
data. Table 3 reports the results for each classifier
using its best configuration. The configuration To-
kenizer1/Remove Stop Words/Freq. Pruning/Worry
lexicon/Humor lexicon/Emoticons was the best con-
figuration for both MaxEnt and Naive Bayes. Deci-
sion Tree differed only in that its best configuration
did not use Frequency Pruning. Table 3 also com-
pares to a simple baseline that classifies messages
as concerned if they contain any of the words in the
worry lexicon (while accuracy is competitive, recall
is quite low).
MaxEnt exhibits the best accuracy, precision, and
F1; Naive Bayes has slightly better recall. Table 4

configuration choice has. Using MaxEnt, we com-
pute the accuracy over every possible system config-
uration, then average the accuracies to obtain each
row. Thus, the Tokenizer1 row reports the average
accuracy over all configurations that use Tokenizer1.
Additionally, we report the highest accuracy of any
configuration using that setting. These results in-
dicate that Tokenizer1, Remove Stop Words, and
Worry Lexicon result in the largest accuracy gains.
Thus, while some unsupervised learning research
has suggested that only light normalization should
be used for social media text analysis (O?Connor et
al., 2010b), for this supervised learning task it ap-
pears that more aggressive normalization and feature
pruning can improve accuracy.
We select the best performing MaxEnt classifier
for use in subsequent experiments. First we retrain
the classifier on all the labeled data, then use it
to label all of the unlabeled data from the original
65,062 messages. To estimate performance on this
new data, we sample 200 additional documents of
this testing data and manually label them (35 posi-
tive, 165 negative). We find that the automated clas-
sifications are accurate in 86% of these documents.
Many of the remaining errors appear to be diffi-
cult cases. For example, consider the message: ?1st
an earthquake, now a hurricane? Damn NY do you
31
miss me that bad?? The classifier labels this as con-
cerned, but the message is likely intended to be hu-
morous. In another message (?#PrayForNYC and
everyone that will experience Hurricane Irene?), a
hashtag #PrayForNYC complicates tokenization, so
the word ?pray? (highly correlated with concern) is
not detected, resulting in a false negative.
Demographic Analysis
We next apply this classifier to assess the demo-
graphic determinants of concerned messages. By
classifying all remaining messages, we can analyze
trends in sentiment over time by gender and region.
Figure 2 displays the total number of messages
by day as well as the subset (and percentage) that
are classified as concerned. Consulting the timeline
in Figure 1, we see that the peak volume occurs on
August 27th, the day the eye of the hurricane makes
landfall. The percentage of messages labeled as con-
cerned actually peaks a day earlier, on August 26th.
Geographic Analysis
We first make several observations concerning Fig-
ure 1, which does not use the sentiment classifier,
but only displays message volume. There appears to
be a regional difference in when message volume
peaks. Data point C in the figure, which marks the
time around 2pm on August 23rd, represents the first
noticeable spike in message count, particularly in the
Upper South region. Two important events were oc-
curring around this time period. First, the strongest
earthquake to hit the Eastern United States since
WWII (measured as 5.8 on the Richter scale) oc-
curs near Richmond, Virginia. Also on August 23rd,
a few hours prior to the earthquake, FEMA holds a
press conference regarding the impeding threat that
Hurricane Irene will pose to East Coast states. It
appears likely that the combination of these events
leads to the increase in messages on August 23rd
as revealed in the figure. In fact, in examining some
of the messages posted on Twitter during that time
period, we notice some people commenting on the
unlikeliness that two natural disasters would hit the
region in such a narrow time frame.
Also in Figure 1, we see that the frequency of
Twitter messages relating to Hurricane Irene for
each region increases greatly over roughly the pe-

riod of August 25th to August 28th, before decreas-
ing later on August 28th and beyond. The increase
and decrease roughly parallel the approach of Hurri-
cane Irene toward and then beyond each region. Data
point I represents the time (August 27th at 8am)
when the center of Hurricane Irene makes landfall
on the North Carolina coast. This point represents
the highest message count for the Upper South re-
gion. Later on August 27th, as the hurricane moves
north toward New Jersey and then New York, we
see the peak message count for the Middle States
region (Data point K). Finally, on August 28th in
the late morning, as Hurricane Irene moves into the
New England region, we see that the New England
regions peak message count occurs (Data Point L).
With the sentiment classifier from the previous
section, we can perform a more detailed analysis
of the regional differences than can be performed
using message volume alone. Figure 3 applies the
sentiment classifier to assess the proportion of mes-
sages from each region that express concern. Figure
3 (top) shows the raw percentage of messages from
each region by day, while the bottom figure shows
the proportion of messages from each region that ex-
press concern. While the New England region has
the lowest volume of messages, on many days it has
the highest proportion of concerned messages.
Comparing regional differences in aggregate
across all 10 days would be misleading ? after the
hurricane passes a region, it is expected that the level
of concern should decrease. Indeed, these aggregate
regional differences are not statistically significant
(NE=15.59%, MID=15.4%, SOUTH=15.69%). In-
stead, for each day we compare the levels of concern

August 26: NE=18.5%, SOUTH=15.1%). It is diffi-
cult to directly attribute causes to these differences,
although on August 25, a Hurricane Watch was is-
sued for the New England area, and on August 27
that Watch was upgraded to a Warning. It is also
possible that states that experience hurricanes more
frequently express lower levels of concern. Further
sociological research is necessary to fully address
these differences.
Gender Analysis
We apply a similar analysis to assess the differ-
ences in levels of concern by gender. Figure 4 shows
that for roughly the period between August 24th
and August 29th, messages written by females are
more likely to express concern than those written
by males. Over the entire period, 18.7% of female-
authored messages are labeled as concerned, while
over the same period 13.9% of male-authored mes-
sages are labeled as concerned. We perform a Chi-

squared test over the entire period, and find that gen-
der differences in concern are significant (p < .01).
We conclude that messages attributed to female au-
thors are significantly more likely to be classified as
concerned than messages authored by males.
In order to assess a possible gender bias in our
classifier, we examine the proportion of concern for
males and females in the labeled training set. We
find that of the original 408 labeled messages, 69
are from males, 112 are from females, and 227 can-
not be determined. 24 male messages, or 34.8%, are
marked as concerned. In contrast, 57 female mes-
sages, or 50.9%, are marked as concerned. 88 of the
undetermined gender messages, or 38.9%, are con-
cerned. We therefore down-sample the female mes-
sages from our labeled training set until the propor-
tion of female-concerned messages matches that of
male-concerned messages. Repeating our classifica-
tion experiments shows no significant difference in
the relative proportions of messages labeled as con-
cerned by gender. We therefore conclude that the
training set is not injecting a gender bias in the clas-
sifier.

Table 5: Top 30 words for each demographic ranked by
Information Gain.
Qualitative Analysis
In Table 5 we provide a brief qualitative analy-
sis by displaying the top 30 words for each demo-
graphic obtained using Information Gain (Manning
and Schtze, 1999), a method of detecting features
that discriminate between document classes. To pro-
vide some of the missing context: ?jada? refers to
the divorce of celebrities Will Smith and Jada Pin-
kett; ?hurac? refers to the Spanish word Huraca?n;
?smem? stands for Social Media for Emergency
Management; ?dolphin? refers to a joke that was cir-
culated referencing the hurricane; ?lls? is an abbre-
viation for ?laughing like shit?.
Some broad trends appear: male users tend to ref-
erence news, politics, or jokes; the Middle States
reference the evacuation of New York City, and the
South refers back to other disasters (the earthquake,
the sniper attacks of 2002, Hurricane Isabel).
Related Work
Recent research has investigated the effectiveness of
social media for crisis communication (Savelyev et
al., 2011) ? indeed, the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency now uses Twitter to dissem-
inate information during natural disasters (Kalish,
2011). Other work has examined the spread of
false rumors during earthquakes (Mendoza et al.,
2010) and tsunamis (Acar and Muraki, 2011) and
characterized social network dynamics during floods
(Cheong and Cheong, 2011), fires (Vieweg et al.,
2010), and violence (Heverin and Zach, 2010).
While some of this past research organizes messages
by topic, to our knowledge no work has analyzed
disaster sentiment or its demographic determinants.
Survey research by West and Orr (2007) con-
cluded that women may feel more vulnerable dur-
ing hurricanes because they are more likely to have
children and belong to a lower socio-economic class.
Richer people, they find, tend to have an easier time
dealing with natural disasters like hurricanes. These
reasons might explain our finding that women are
more likely on Twitter to show concern than men
about Hurricane Irene. West and Orr also find dif-
ferences in regional perceptions of vulnerability be-
tween coastal areas and non-coastal areas. Our loca-
tion annotation must be more precise before we can
perform a similar analysis.
More generally, our approach can be considered
a type of computational social science, an emerging
area of study applying computer science algorithms
to social science research (Lazer et al., 2009; Hop-
kins and King, 2010).
Conclusion and Future Work
Our results show that analyzing Twitter messages
relating to Hurricane Irene reveals differences in
sentiment depending on a person?s gender or loca-
tion. We conclude that social media analysis is a vi-
able complement to existing survey methodologies,
providing real-time insight into public perceptions
of a disaster. Future directions include investigating
how to account for classifier error in hypothesis test-
ing (Fuller, 1987), adjusting classification propor-
tions using quantification methods (Forman, 2007),
as well as applying the approach to different disas-
ters and identifying additional sentiment classes of
interest. Finally, it will be important to infer a greater
variety of demographic attributes and also to adjust
for the demographic bias inherent in social media.
