Abstract
This paper proposes a probabilistic approach
to the resolution of referring expressions for
task-oriented dialogue systems. The approach
resolves descriptions, anaphora, and deixis in
a unified manner. In this approach, the notion
of reference domains serves an important role
to handle context-dependent attributes of enti-
ties and references to sets. The evaluation with
the REX-J corpus shows promising results.
1 Introduction
Referring expressions (REs) are expressions in-
tended by speakers to identify entities to hearers.
REs can be classified into three categories: descrip-
tions, anaphora, and deixis; and, in most cases,
have been studied within each category and with a
narrowly focused interest. Descriptive expressions
(such as ?the blue glass on the table?) exploit at-
tributes of entities and relations between them to
distinguish an entity from the rest. They are well
studied in natural language generation, e.g., (Dale
and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer et al., 2003; Dale and Vi-
ethen, 2009). Anaphoric expressions (such as ?it?)
refer to entities or concepts introduced in the pre-
ceding discourse and are studied mostly on textual
monologues, e.g., (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Mitkov,
2002; Ng, 2010). Deictic (exophoric) expressions
(such as ?this one?) refer to entities outside the pre-
ceding discourse. They are often studied focusing
on pronouns accompanied with pointing gestures in
physical spaces, e.g., (Gieselmann, 2004).
Dialogue systems (DSs) as natural human-
machine (HM) interfaces are expected to han-
dle all the three categories of referring expres-
sions (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001). In fact, the
three categories are not mutually exclusive. To be
concrete, a descriptive expression in conversation is
either deictic or anaphoric. It is, however, not easy to
tell whether a RE is deictic or anaphoric in advance
of a resolution (regardless of whether the RE is de-
scriptive or not). Therefore, we propose a general
unified approach to the above three kinds of REs.
We employ a Bayesian network (BN) to model a
RE. Dealing with continuous information and vague
situations is critical to handle real world problems.
Probabilistic approaches enable this for reference re-
solvers. Each BN is dynamically constructed based
on the structural analysis result of a RE and contex-
tual information available at that moment. The BN
is used to estimate the probability with which the
corresponding RE refers to an entity.
One of the two major contributions of this paper is
our probabilistic formulation that handles the above
three kinds of REs in a unified manner. Previously
Iida et al. (2010) proposed a quantitative approach
that handles anaphoric and deictic expressions in a
unified manner. However it lacks handling of de-
scriptive expressions. Our formulation subsumes
and extends it to handle descriptive REs. So far, no
previously proposed method for reference resolution
handles all three types of REs.
The other contribution is bringing reference
domains into that formulation. Reference do-
mains (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2000) are sets of
referents implicitly presupposed at each use of REs.
By considering them, our approach can appropri-
ately interpret context-dependent attributes. In ad-
dition, by treating a reference domain as a referent,
REs referring to sets of entities are handled, too. As
far as the authors know, this work is the first that
takes a probabilistic approach to reference domains.

1.1 Reference domains
First, we explain reference domains concretely. Ref-
erence domains (RDs) (Salmon-Alt and Romary,
2000; Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001; Denis, 2010)
are theoretical constructs, which are basically sets
of entities presupposed at each use of REs. RDs in
the original literature are not mere sets of entities
but mental objects equipped with properties such
as type, focus, or saliency and internally structured
with partitions. In this paper, while we do not ex-
plicitly handle partitions, reference domains can be
nested as an approximation of partitioning, that is,
an entity included in a RD is either an individual en-
tity or another RD. Each RD d has its focus and de-
gree of saliency (a non-negative real number). Here-
after, two of them are denoted as foc(d) and sal(d)
respectively. RDs are sorted in descending order ac-
cording to saliency.
We illustrate reference domains with figure 1. It
shows a snapshot of solving a Tangram puzzle (the
puzzle and corpus are explained in section 3.1). RDs
are introduced into our mental spaces either linguis-
tically (by hearing a RE) or visually (by observing
a physical situation). If one says ?the two big tri-
angles? in the situation shown in figure 1, we will
recognize a RD consisting of pieces 1 and 2. If we
observe one moves piece 1 and attaches it to piece
2, we will perceptually recognize a RD consisting
of pieces 1, 2, and 6 due to proximity (Tho?risson,
1994). In a similar way, a RD consisting of pieces 5
and 7 also can be recognized. Hereafter, we indicate
a RD with the mark @ with an index, and denote
its elements by enclosing them with [ ]. E.g., @1 =
[1, 2], @2 = [1, 2, 6], @3 = [5, 7]. The focused en-
tity is marked by ?*?. Thus, foc([1?, 2]) = 1.
The referent of a RE depends on which RD is pre-
supposed. That is, if one presupposes @1 or @2, the
referent of ?the right piece? should be piece 1. If
one presupposes @3, the referent of the same RE
should be piece 5. This is the context-dependency
mentioned above.
Previous work on RDs (Salmon-Alt and Romary,
2000; Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001; Denis, 2010)
employ not probabilistic but formal approaches.
1.2 Probabilistic approaches to REs
Here, previous probabilistic approaches to REs are
explained and differences between ours and theirs
Figure 1: Tangram puzzle. (The labels 1 to 7 are for il-
lustration purposes and not visible to participants.)
are highlighted. Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988;
Jensen and Nielsen, 2007) have been not often but
occasionally applied to problems in natural language
processing/computational linguistics since (Char-
niak and Goldman, 1989). With regard to REs,
Burger and Connolly (1992) proposed a BN special-
ized for anaphora resolution. Weissenbacher (2005;
2007) proposed a BN for the resolution of non-
anaphoric ?it? and also a BN for the resolution of
pronominal anaphora. They used pre-defined fixed
BNs for their tasks while our approach dynamically
tailors a BN for each RE.
Cho and Maida (1992) and Roy (2002) adopted
not exactly BNs but similar probabilistic approaches
for reference resolution and generation respectively.
However, their foci are only on descriptions.
Lison et al. (2010) proposed an approach using
Markov logic networks (MLNs) (Richardson and
Domingos, 2006) to reference resolution. They
dealt with only deictic and descriptive REs. Even
though MLNs are also a probabilistic framework, it
is difficult for DS developers to provide quantitative
domain knowledge needed to resolve REs because
MLNs accept domain knowledge in the form of for-
mal logic rules with weights, which must be deter-
mined globally. In contrast, BNs are more flexible
and easy in providing quantitative knowledge to DSs
in the form of conditional probability tables, which
can be determined locally.
As just described, there are several probabilis-
tic approaches to REs but none of them incorpo-
rates reference domains. In the next section, we in-
troduce our REBNs (Referring Expression Bayesian
Networks), a novel Bayesian network-based model-
ing approach to REs that incorporates reference do-
mains.

2 Bayesian Network-based Modeling of
Referring Expressions
Each REBN is dedicated for a RE in the context at
the moment. Its structure is determined by the syn-
tactic and semantic information in the RE and prob-
ability tables are determined by the context.
2.1 Structures
Figure 2 shows the fundamental network structure
of REBNs. We call this structure WCXD. The four
nodes (random variables)W ,C,X , andD represent
an observed word, the concept denoted by the word,
the referent of the RE, and the presupposed RD, re-
spectively. Here, a word means a lexical entry in
the system dictionary defined by the DS developer
(concept dictionary; section 3.2.1).
Each REBN is constructed by modifying or mul-
tiply connecting the WCXD structure as shown in
figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the network for REs
indicating one referent such as ?that table.? EachWi
node has a corresponding word wi. Figure 4 shows
the network for REs indicating two referents such as
?his table.? We call the class of the former REs s-
REX (simple Referring EXpression) and the class of
the latter REs c-REX (compound Referring EXpres-
sion). Although REBNs have the potential to deal
with c-REX, hereafter we concentrate on s-REX be-
cause the page space is limited and the corpus used
for evaluation contains very few c-REX instances.
Although, in section 1, we explained that (Iida et
al., 2010) handles anaphoric and deictic expressions
in a unified manner, it handles anaphora to instances
only and does not handle that to concepts. There-
fore, it cannot satisfactorily resolve such an expres-
sion ?Bring me the red box, and the blue one, too.?
Here, ?one? does not refer to the physical referent
of ?the red box? but refers to the concept of ?box?.
TheC nodes will enable handling of such references
to concepts. This is one of the important features of
REBNs but will be investigated in future work.

2.2 Domains of random variables
A REBN for an s-REX instance of N words
has 2N + 2 discrete random variables:
W1, . . . ,WN , C1, . . . , CN , X , and D. The do-
main of each variable depends on the corresponding
RE and the context at the moment. Here, D(V )
denotes the domain of a random variable V .
D(Wi) contains the corresponding observed word
wi and a special symbol ? that represents other pos-
sibilities, i.e., D(Wi) = {wi,?}. Each Wi has a
corresponding node Ci.
D(Ci) containsM concepts that can be expressed
by wi and a special concept ? that represents other
possibilities, i.e., D(Ci) = {c1i , . . . , cMi ,?}. cji
(j = 1 . . .M ) are looked up from the concept dic-
tionary (see section 3.2.1, table 2).
D(D) contains L + 1 RDs recognized up to that
point in time, i.e., D(D) = {@0,@1, . . . ,@L}. @0
is the ground domain that contains all the individ-
ual entities to be referred to in a dialogue. At the
beginning of the dialogue, D(D) = {@0}. Other
L RDs are incrementally added in the course of the
dialogue.
D(X) contains all the possible referents, i.e., K
individual entities and L + 1 RDs. Thus, D(X) =
{x1, . . . , xK ,@0, . . . ,@L}. Including RDs enables
handling of references to sets.
Then reference resolution is formalized as below:
x? = argmax
x?D(X)
P (X = x|W1 = w1, . . . ,WN = wN ). (1)
P (X|W1, . . . ,WN ) is obtained by marginalizing
the joint probabilities that are computed with the
probability tables described in the next subsection.
239
2.3 Probability tables
Probability distributions are given as (conditional)
probability tables since all the random variables
used in a REBN are discrete. Here, four types of
probability tables used by REBNs are described.
2.3.1 P (Wi|Ci, X)
P (Wi = w|Ci = c,X = x) is the probability that
a hearer observes w from c and x which the speaker
intends to indicate.
In most cases, Wi does not depend on X , i.e.,
P (Wi|Ci, X) ? P (Wi|Ci). X is, however, nec-
essary to handle individualized terms (names).
There are several conceivable ways of probabil-
ity assignment. One simple way is: for each cji ,
P (W = wi|C = cji ) = 1/T, P (W = ?|C =
cji ) = (T ? 1)/T , and for ?, P (W = wi|C =
?) = ", P (W = ?|C = ?) = 1 ? ". Here T is the
number of possible words for cji . " is a predefined
small number such as 10?8. We use this assignment
in the evaluation.
2.3.2 P (Ci|X,D)
P (Ci = c|X = x,D = d) is the probability that
concept c is chosen from D(Ci) to indicate x in d.
The developers of DSs cannot provide
P (Ci|X,D) in advance because D(Ci) is context-
dependent. Therefore, we take an approach of
composing P (Ci|X = x,D = d) from R(cji , x, d)
(cji ? D(Ci)\{?}). Here R(cji , x, d) is the rele-
vancy of concept cji to referent x with regard to d,
and 0 ? R(cji , x, d) ? 1. 1 means full relevancy
and 0 means no relevancy. 0.5 means neutral. For
example, a concept BOX will have a high relevancy
to a suitcase such as 0.8 but a concept BALL will
have a low relevancy to the suitcase such as 0.1.
If x is not in d, R(cji , x, d) is 0. Algorithm 1
in appendix A shows an algorithm to compose
P (Ci|X = x,D = d) from R(cji , x, d). Concept
? will be assigned a high probability if none of
cji ? D(Ci)\{?} has a high relevancy to x.
If cji is static,1 R(cji , x, d) is numerically given in
advance in the form of a table. If not static, it is im-
plemented as a function by the DS developer, that is,
R(cji , x, d) = fcji (x, d, I). Here I is all the informa-tion available from the DS.
1Whether a concept is static or not depends on each DS.
For example, given a situation such as shown in
figure 1, the relevancy function of a positional con-
cept LEFT (suppose a RE such as ?the left piece?)
can be implemented as below:
fLEFT(x, d, I) = (ux ? ur)/(ul ? ur). (2)
Here, ux, ul and ur are respectively the horizontal
coordinates of x, the leftmost piece in d, and the
rightmost piece in d, which are obtained from I . If
x is a RD, the relevancy is given as the average of
entities included in the RD.
2.3.3 P (X|D)
P (X = x|D = d) is the probability that entity x
in RD d is referred to, which is estimated according
to the contextual information at the time the corre-
sponding RE is uttered but irrespective of attributive
information in the RE. The contextual information
includes the history of referring so far (discourse)
and physical statuses such as the gaze of the referrer
(situation). We call P (X = x|D = d) the predic-
tion model.
The prediction model can be constructed by us-
ing a machine learning-based method. We use a
ranking-based method (Iida et al., 2010). The score
output by the method is input into the standard sig-
moid function and normalized to be a probability. If
x is not in d, P (X = x|D = d) is 0.
2.3.4 P (D)
P (D = d) is the probability that RD d is presup-
posed at the time the RE is uttered. We cannot col-
lect data to estimate this probabilistic model because
RDs are implicit. Therefore, we examine three a pri-
ori approximation functions based on the saliency of
d. Saliency is proportional to recency.2
Uniformmodel This model ignores saliency. This
is introduced to see the importance of saliency.
P (D = d) = 1/|D(D)| (3)
Linear model This model distributes probabilities
in proportion to saliency. This is an analogy of the
method used in (Denis, 2010).
P (D = d) = sal(d)?
d??D(D) sal(d?)
(4)
2Assignment of saliency is described in section 3.2.3.
240
Exponential model This model puts emphasis on
recent RDs. This function is so called soft-max.
P (D = d) = exp(sal(d))?
d??D(D) exp(sal(d?))
(5)
3 Experimental Evaluation
We evaluated the potential of the proposed frame-
work by using a situated human-human (HH) dia-
logue corpus.
3.1 Corpus
We used the REX-J Japanese referring expression
corpus (Spanger et al., 2010). The REX-J corpus
consists of 24 HH dialogues in each of which two
participants solve a Tangram puzzle of seven pieces
(see figure 1). The goal of the puzzle is combining
seven pieces to form a designated shape (such as a
swan). One of two subjects takes the role of opera-
tor (OP) and the other takes the role of solver (SV).
The OP can manipulate the virtual puzzle pieces dis-
played on a PC monitor by using a computer mouse
but does not know the goal shape. The SV knows
the goal shape but cannot manipulate the pieces. The
states of the pieces and the mouse cursor operated by
the OP are shared by the two subjects in real time.
Thus, the two participants weave a collaborative dia-
logue including many REs to the pieces. In addition
to REs, the positions and directions of the pieces, the
position of the mouse cursor, and the manipulation
by the OP were recorded with timestamps and the
IDs of relevant pieces.
3.1.1 Annotation
Each RE is annotated with its referent(s) as shown
in table 1. The 1st RE okkiisankaku3 big triangle ?a
big triangle? in the table is ambiguous and refers to
either piece 1 or 2. The 7th and 8th REs refer to
the set of pieces 1 and 2. The other REs refer to an
individual piece.
To skip the structural analysis of REs to avoid
problems due to errors in such analysis, we have
additionally annotated the corpus with intermediate
structures, from which REBNs are constructed. Be-
cause we focus on s-REX only in this paper, the
3Words are not separated by white spaces in Japanese.
intermediate structures are straightforward:4 paren-
thesized lists of separated words as shown in ta-
ble 1. The procedure to generate a REBN of s-REX
from such an intermediate structure is also straight-
forward and thus it is not explained due to the page
limitation.
3.2 Implementations
We use BNJ5 for probabilistic computation. Here
we describe the implementations of resources and
procedures that are more or less specific to the task
domain of REX-J.
3.2.1 Concept dictionary
Table 2 shows an excerpt of the concept dictio-
nary defined for REX-J. We manually defined 40
concepts by observing the dialogues.
3.2.2 Static relevancy table and relevancy
functions
For 13 concepts out of 40, their relevancy values
were manually determined by the authors. Table 3
shows an excerpt of the static relevancy table defined
for the seven pieces shown in figure 1. TRI is rele-
vant only to pieces 1 to 5, and SQR is relevant only
to pieces 6 and 7 but is not totally relevant to piece 7
because it is not a square in a precise sense. FIG is
equally but not very relevant to all the pieces,6
For the remaining 27 concepts, we implemented
relevancy functions (see appendix B).
3.2.3 Updating the list of RDs
In our experiment, REs are sequentially resolved
from the beginning of each dialogue in the corpus.
In the course of resolution, RDs are added into a list
and updated by the following procedure. RDs are
sorted in descending order according to saliency.
At each time of resolution, we assume that all the
previous REs are correctly resolved. Therefore, af-
ter each time of resolution, if the correct referent of
the last RE is a set, we add a new RD equivalent
to the set into the list of RDs, unless the list con-
tains another equivalent RD already. In either case,
the saliency of the RD equivalent to the set is set to
?+1 unless the RD is at the head of the list already.
4In the case of c-REX, graph-like structures are required.
5http://bnj.sourceforge.net/
6This is because concept FIG in REX-J is usually used to
refer to not a single piece but a shaped form (combined pieces).

Here, ? is the largest saliency value in the list at the
moment (the saliency value of the head RD).
Before each time of resolution, we check whether
the piece that is most recently manipulated after the
previous RE constitutes a perceptual group by using
the method explained in section 3.2.4 at the onset
time of the target RE. If such a group is recognized,
we add a new RD equivalent to the recognized group
unless the list contains another equivalent RD. In ei-
ther case, the saliency of the RD equivalent is set to
?+1 unless the RD is at the head of the list already,
and the focus of the equivalent RD is set to the most
recently manipulated piece.
When a new RD@m is added to the list, a comple-
mentary RD @n and a subsuming RD @l are also in-
serted just after @m in the list. Here, @n = @0\@m
and @l = [@m?,@n]. This operation is required to
handle a concept REST, e.g., ?the remaining pieces.?
3.2.4 Perceptual grouping
There is a generally available method of simulated
perceptual grouping (Tho?risson, 1994). It works
well in a spread situation such as shown in figure 1
but tends to produce results that do not match our
intuition when pieces are tightly packed at the end
of a dialogue. Therefore, we adopt a simple method
that recognizes a group when a piece is attached to
another. This method is less general but works sat-
isfactorily in the REX-J domain due to the nature of
the Tangram puzzle.
3.2.5 Ranking-based prediction model
As mentioned in section 2.3.3, a ranking-based
method (Iida et al., 2010) using SVMrank (Joachims,
2006) was adopted for constructing the prediction
model P (X|D). This model ranks entities accord-
ing to 16 binary features such as whether the tar-
get entity is previously referred to (a discourse fea-
ture), whether the target is under the mouse cursor
(a mouse cursor feature), etc.7
When a target is a set (i.e., a RD), discourse fea-
tures for it are computed as in the case of a piece;
meanwhile, mouse cursor features are handled in a
different manner. That is, if one of the group mem-
bers meets the criterion of a mouse cursor feature,
the group is judged as meeting the criterion.
In (Iida et al., 2010), preparing different models
for pronouns and non-pronouns achieved better per-
formance. Therefore we trained two linear kernel
SVM models for pronouns and non-pronouns with
the 24 dialogues.
3.3 Experiment
We used the 24 dialogues for evaluation.8 As men-
tioned in section 2.1, we focused on s-REX. These
24 dialogues contain 1,474 s-REX instances and 28
c-REX instances. In addition to c-REX, we ex-
cluded REs mentioning complicated concepts, for
which it is difficult to implement relevancy func-
tions in a short time.9 After excluding those REs,
7Following the results shown in (Iida et al., 2010), we did
not use the 6 manipulation-related features (CO1 . . . CO6).
8We used the same data to train the SVM-rank models. This
is equivalent to assuming that we have data large enough to sat-
urate the performance of the prediction model.
9Mostly, those are metaphors such as ?neck? and concepts
related to operations such as ?put.? For example, although

REs (13.9%) refers to sets, and 612 REs (46.7%) are
demonstrative pronouns such as sore ?it.?
3.3.1 Settings
We presupposed the following conditions.
Speaker role independence: We assumed REs
are independent of speaker roles, i.e., SV and OP.
All REs were mixed and processed serially.
Perfect preprocessing and past information:
As mentioned in sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.3, we as-
sumed that no error comes from preprocessing in-
cluding speech recognition, morphological analysis,
and syntactic analysis;10 and all the correct referents
of past REs are known.11
No future information: In HH dialogue, some-
times information helpful for resolving a RE is pro-
vided after the RE is uttered. We, however, do not
consider such future information.
Numeral information: Many languages includ-
ing English grammatically require indication of nu-
meral distinctions by using such as articles, singu-
lar/plural forms of nouns and copulas, etc. Although
Japanese does not have such grammatical devices,12
it would be possible to predict such distinctions by
using a machine learning technique with linguistic
?putting a piece? and ?getting a piece out? are distinguished
due to speakers? intentions, they are (at least superficially) ho-
mogeneous in the physical data available from the corpus and
difficult for machines to distinguish each other.
10In general, the speech and expressions in human-machine
(HM) dialogue are less complex and less difficult to process
than those in HH dialogue data. This is typcially observed as
fewer disfluencies (Shriberg, 2001) and simpler sentences with
fewer omissions (Itoh et al., 2002). Therefore, when we apply
our framework to real DSs, we can expect clearer and simpler
input and thus better performance. We supposed that the condi-
tion of perfect preprocessing in HH dialogue approximates the
results to those obtained when HM dialogue data is used.
11If a reference is misinterpreted (i.e., wrongly resolved) in a
dialogue, usually that misinterpretation will be repaired by the
interlocutors in the succeeding interaction once the misinterpre-
tation becomes apparent. Therefore, accumulating all past er-
rors in resolution is rather irrational as an experimental setting.

and gestural information. Therefore we observed the
effect of providing such information. In the follow-
ing experiment we provide the singular/plural dis-
tinction information to REBNs by looking at the an-
notations of the correct referents in advance. This
is achieved by adding a special evidence node C0,
where D(C0) = {S,P}. P (C0 = S|X = x) = 1
and P (P|x) = 0 if x is a piece. On the contrary,
P (S|x) = 0 and P (P|x) = 1 if x is a set.
3.3.2 Baselines
To our best knowledge, there is no directly com-
parable method. We set up two baselines. The first
baseline uses the most recent as the resolved refer-
ent for each RE (Initial resolution of each dialogue
always fails). This baseline is called Most-recent.
As the second baseline, we prepared another
P (D) model in addition to those explained in sec-
tion 2.3.4, which is called Mono-domain. In Mono-
domain, D(D) consists of only a single RD @?0,
which contains individual pieces and the RDs recog-
nized up to that point in time. That is, @?0 = D(X).
Resolution using this model can be considered as
a straightforward extension of (Iida et al., 2010),
which enables handling of richer concepts in REs13
and handling of REs to sets14.
3.3.3 Results
The performance of reference resolution is pre-
sented by category and by condition in terms of ac-
curacy (# of correctly resolved REs/# of REs).
We set up the three categories in evaluating res-
olution, that is, Single, Plural, and Total. Category
Single is the collection of REs referring to a single
piece. Plural is the collection of REs referring to a
set of pieces. Total is the sum of them. Ambigu-
ous REs such as the first one in table 1 are counted
as ?Single? and the resolution of such a RE is con-
sidered correct if the resolved result is one of the
possible referents.
13(Iida et al., 2010) used only object types and sizes. Other
concepts such as LEFT were simply ignored.
14(Iida et al., 2010) did not deal with REs to sets.

?w/o S/P info.? indicates experimental results
without singular/plural distinction information. ?w/
S/P info.? indicates experimental results with it.
Table 4 shows the results of reference resolution
per P (D) modeling method.15 Obviously S/P infor-
mation has a significant impact.
While the best performance for category Single
was achieved with the Linear model, the best perfor-
mance for Plural was achieved with the Exponen-
tial model. If it is possible to know whether a RE
is of Single or Plural, that is, if S/P information is
available, we can choose a suitable P (D) model.
Therefore, by switching models, the best perfor-
mance of Total with S/P information reached 83.4%,
and a gain of 2.0 points against Mono-domain was
achieved (sign test, p < 0.0001).
Because the corpus did not include many in-
stances to which the notion of reference domains is
effective, the impact of RDs may appear small on the
whole. In fact, the impact was not small. By intro-
ducing RDs, resolution in category Plural achieved
a significant advancement. The highest gain from
Mono-domain was 9.3 points (sign test, p < 0.005).
Moreover, more REs containing positional concepts
such as LEFT and RIGHT were correctly resolved
in the cases of Uniform, Linear, and Exponential.
Table 5 summarizes the resolution results of four
positional concepts (with S/P information). While
Mono-domain resolved 65% of them, Linear cor-
rectly resolved 75% (sign test, p < 0.05).
As shown in table 4, the performance of the Uni-
form model was worse than that of Mono-domain.
This indicates that RDs introduced without an ap-
propriate management of them would be harmful
noise. Conversely, it also suggests that there might
be a room for improvement by looking deeply into
the management of RDs (e.g., forgetting old RDs).
4 Conclusion
This paper proposed a probabilistic approach to ref-
erence resolution, REBNs, which stands for Refer-
ring Expression Bayesian Networks. At each time
of resolution, a dedicated BN is constructed for the
15According to the results of preliminary experiments, even
in the case of the Uniform/Linear/Exponential models, we re-
solved the REs having demonstratives with the Mono-domain
model. This is in line with the finding of separating models
between pronouns and non-pronouns in (Iida et al., 2010).

RE in question. The constructed BN deals with ei-
ther descriptive, deictic or anaphoric REs in a uni-
fied manner. REBNs incorporate the notion of ref-
erence domains (RDs), which enables the resolution
of REs with context-dependent attributes and han-
dling of REs to sets. REBNs are for task-oriented
dialogue systems and presuppose a certain amount
of domain-dependent manual implementation by de-
velopers. Therefore, REBNs would not be suited
to general text processing or non-task-oriented sys-
tems. However, REBNs have the potential to be a
standard approach that can be used for any and all
task-oriented applications such as personal agents in
smart phones, in-car systems, service robots, etc. ?
The proposed approach was evaluated with the
REX-J human-human dialogue corpus and promis-
ing results were obtained. The impact of incorpo-
rating RDs in the domain of the REX-J corpus was
recognizable but not so large on the whole. How-
ever, in other types of task domains where grouping
and comparisons of objects occur frequently, the im-
pact would be larger. Note that REBNs are not lim-
ited to Japanese, even though the evaluation used a
Japanese corpus. Evaluations with human-machine
dialogue are important future work.
Although this paper focused on the simple type of
REs without relations, REBNs are potentially able
to deal with complex REs with relations. The eval-
uation for complex REs is necessary to validate this
potential of REBN. Currently REBN assumes REs
whose referents are concrete entities. An extension
for handling abstract entities (Byron, 2002; Mu?ller,
2007) is important future work. Another direction
would be generating REs with REBNs. A generate-
and-test approach is a naive application of REBN
for generation. More efficient method is, however,
necessary.
