Abstract
We present an information theoretic objec-
tive for bilingual word clustering that in-
corporates both monolingual distributional
evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence
from parallel corpora to learn high qual-
ity word clusters jointly in any number of
languages. The monolingual component
of our objective is the average mutual in-
formation of clusters of adjacent words in
each language, while the bilingual com-
ponent is the average mutual information
of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our
method, we use the word clusters in an
NER system and demonstrate a statisti-
cally significant improvement in F1 score
when using bilingual word clusters instead
of monolingual clusters.
1 Introduction
A word cluster is a group of words which ideally
captures syntactic, semantic, and distributional
regularities among the words belonging to the
group. Word clustering is widely used to reduce
the number of parameters in statistical models
which leads to improved generalization (Brown et
al., 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993; Clark, 2003; Koo
et al, 2008; Turian et al, 2010), and multilingual
clustering has been proposed as a means to im-
prove modeling of translational correspondences
and to facilitate projection of linguistic resource
across languages (Och, 1999; Ta?ckstro?m et al,
2012). In this paper, we argue that generally more
informative clusters can be learned when evidence
from multiple languages is considered while cre-
ating the clusters.
We propose a novel bilingual word clustering
objective (?2). The first term deals with each
language independently and ensures that the data
is well-explained by the clustering in a sequence
model (?2.1). The second term ensures that the
cluster alignments induced by a word alignment
have high mutual information across languages
(?2.2). Since the objective consists of terms rep-
resenting the entropy monolingual data (for each
language) and parallel bilingual data, it is partic-
ularly attractive for the usual situation in which
there is much more monolingual data available
than parallel data. Because of its similarity to the
variation of information metric (Meila?, 2003), we
call this bilingual term in the objective the aligned
variation of information.
2 Word Clustering
A word clustering C is a partition of a vocabulary
? = {x1, x2, . . . , x|?|} into K disjoint subsets,
C1, C2, . . . , CK . That is, C = {C1, C2, . . . , CK};
Ci ? Cj = ? for all i 6= j and ?Kk=1Ck = ?.
2.1 Monolingual objective
We use the average surprisal in a probabilistic se-
quence model to define the monolingual clustering
objective. Let ci denote the word class of word
wi. Our objective assumes that the probability of
a word sequence w = ?w1, w2, . . . , wM ? is
p(w) =
M?
i=1
p(ci | ci?1)? p(wi | ci), (2.1)
where c0 is a special start symbol. The term p(ci |
ci?1) is the probability of class ci following class
ci?1, and p(wi | ci) is the probability of class ci
emitting word wi. Using the MLE esitmates after
taking the negative logarithm, this term reduces to
777
the following as shown in (Brown et al, 1992):
H(C;w) = 2
K?
k=1
#(Ck)
M log
#(Ck)
M
?
?
i
?
j 6=i
#(Ci, Cj)
M log
#(Ci, Cj)
M
where #(Ck) is the count of Ck in the corpus w
under the clustering C, #(Ci, Cj) is the count of
the number of times that cluster Ci precedes Cj
and M is the size of the corpus. Using the mono-
lingual objective to cluster, we solve the following
search problem:
C? = arg min
C
H(C;w). (2.2)
2.2 Bilingual objective
Now let us suppose we have a second lan-
guage with vocabulary ? = {y1, y2, . . . , y|?|},
which is clustered into K disjoint subsets D =
{D1, D2, . . . , DK}, and a corpus of text in the
second language, v = ?v1, v2, . . . , vN ?. Obvi-
ously we can cluster both languages using the
monolingual objective above:
C?, D? = arg min
C,D
H(C;w) +H(D; v).
This joint minimization for the clusterings for both
languages clearly has no benefit since the two
terms of the objective are independent. We must
alter the object by further assuming that we have
a priori beliefs that some of the words in w and v
have the same meaning.
To encode this belief, we introduce the notion
of a weighted vocabulary alignment A, which is
a function on pairs of words in vocabularies ? and
? to a value greater than or equal to 0, i.e., A :
?? ? 7? R?0. For concreteness, A(x, y) will be
the number of times that x is aligned to y in a word
aligned parallel corpus. By abuse of notation, we
write marginal weights A(x) = ?y??A(x, y)
and A(y) = ?x??A(x, y). We also define the
set marginals A(C,D) = ?x?C
?
y?DA(x, y).Using this weighted vocabulary alignment, we
state an objective that encourages clusterings to
have high average mutual information when align-
ment links are followed; that is, on average how
much information does knowing the cluster of a
word x ? ? impart about the clustering of y ? ?,
and vice-versa?

& proposed bilingual clustering problem (right).
We call this quantity the aligned variation of
information (AVI).
AVI(C,D;A) =
EA(x,y) [? log p(cx | dy)? log p(dy | cx)]
Writing out the expectation and gathering terms,
we obtain
AVI(C,D;A) = ?

y??
A(x, y)
A(?, ?) ?
[
2 log A(C,D)A(?, ?) ? log p(C)? log p(D)
]
,
where it is assumed that 0 log x = 0.
Our bilingual clustering objective can therefore
be stated as the following search problem over a
linear combination of the monolingual and bilin-
gual objectives:
arg min
C,D
monolingual? ?? ?
H(C;w) +H(D; v) +
??bilingual? ?? ?
?AVI(C,D) .
(2.3)
Understanding AVI. Intuitively, we can imag-
ine sampling a random alignment from the distri-
bution obtained by normalizing A(?, ?). AVI gives
us a measure of how much information do we ob-
tain, on average, from knowing the cluster in one
language about the clustering of a linked element
chosen at random proportional to A(x, ?) (or con-
ditioned the other way around). In the following
sections, we denote AVI(C,D;A) by AVI(C,D).
To further understand AVI, we remark that AVI re-
duces to the VI metric when the alignment maps
words to themselves in the same language. As a
proper metric, VI has a number of attractive prop-
erties, and these can be generalized to AVI (with-
out restriction on the alignment map), namely:
? Non-negativity: AVI(C,D) ? 0;
? Symmetry: AVI(C,D) = AVI(D,C);
? Triangle inequality:
AVI(C,D) + AVI(D,E) ? AVI(C,E);
778
? Identity of indiscernables:
AVI(C,D) = 0 iff C ? D.1
2.3 Example
Figure 2 provides an example illustrating the dif-
ference between the bilingual vs. monolingual
clustering objectives. We compare two different
clusterings of a two-sentence Arabic-English par-
allel corpus (the English half of the corpus con-
tains the same sentence, twice, while the Ara-
bic half has two variants with the same mean-
ing). While English has a relatively rigid SVO
word order, Arabic can alternate between the tradi-
tional VSO order and an more modern SVO order.
Since our monolingual clustering objective relies
exclusively on the distribution of clusters before
and after each token, flexible word order alterna-
tions like this can cause unintuitive results. To
further complicate matters, verbs can inflect dif-
ferently depending on whether their subject pre-
cedes or follows them (Haywood and Nahmad,
1999), so a monolingual model, which knows
nothing about morphology and may only rely
on distributional clues, has little chance of per-
forming well without help. This is indeed what
we observe in the monolingual objective opti-
mal solution (center), in which AwlAd (boys) and
yElbwn (play+PRES + 3PL) are grouped into a
single class, while yElb (play+PRES + 3SG) is in
its own class. However, the AVI term (which is of
course not included) has a value of 1.0, reflecting
the relatively disordered clustering relative to the
given alignment. On the right, we see the optimal
solution that includes the AVI term in the cluster-
ing objective. This has an AVI of 0, indicating that
knowing the clustering of any word is completely
informative about the words it is aligned to. By in-
cluding this term, a slightly worse monolingual so-
lution is chosen, but the clustering corresponds to
the reasonable intuition that words with the same
meaning (i.e., the two variants of to play) should
be clustered together.
2.4 Inference
Figure 1 shows the factor graph representation
of our clustering models. Finding the optimal
clustering under both the monolingual and bilin-
gual objectives is a computationally hard combi-
natorial optimization problem (Och, 1995). We
use a greedy hill-climbing word exchange algo-
rithm (Martin et al, 1995) to find a minimum
1C ? D iff ?i|{D(y)|?(x, y) ? A, C(x) = i}| = 1
value for our objective. We terminate the opti-
mization procedure when the number of words
exchanged at the end of one complete iteration
through both the languages is less than 0.1% of
the sum of vocabulary of the two languages and
at least five complete iterations have been com-
pleted.2 For every language the word clusters are
initialised in a round robin order according to the
token frequency.
3 Experiments
Evaluation of clustering is not a trivial problem.
One branch of work seeks to recast the problem
as the of part-of-speech (POS) induction and at-
tempts to match linguistic intuitions. However,
hard clusters are particularly useful for down-
stream tasks (Turian et al, 2010). We therefore
chose to focus our evaluation on the latter prob-
lem. For our evaluation, we use our word clusters
as an input to a named entity recognizer which
uses these clusters as a source of features. Our
evaluation task is the German corpus with NER
annotation that was created for the shared task
at CoNLL-2003 3. The training set contains ap-
proximately 220,000 tokens and the development
set and test set contains 55,000 tokens each. We
use Stanford?s Named Entity Recognition system4
which uses a linear-chain conditional random field
to predict the most likely sequence of NE la-
bels (Finkel and Manning, 2009).
Corpora for Clustering: We used parallel cor-
pora for {Arabic, English, French, Korean &
Turkish}-German pairs from WIT-3 corpus (Cet-
tolo et al, 2012) 5, which is a collection of trans-
lated transcriptions of TED talks. Each language
pair contained around 1.5 million German words.
The corpus was word aligned in two directions
using an unsupervised word aligner (Dyer et al,
2013), then the intersected alignment points were
taken.
Monolingual Clustering: For every language
pair, we train German word clusters on the mono-
lingual German data from the parallel data. Note
that the parallel corpora are of different sizes and
hence the monolingual German data from every
parallel corpus is different. We treat the F1 score
2In practice, the number of exchanged words drops of exponentially,
so this threshold is typically reached in not many iterations.

obtained using monolingual word clusters (? = 0)
as the baseline. Table 1 shows the F1 score of
NER6 when trained on these monolingual German
word clusters.
Bilingual Clustering: While we have formu-
lated a joint objective that enables using both
monolingual and bilingual evidence, it is possible
to create word clusters using the bilingual signal
only by removing the first term in Eq. 2.3. Ta-
ble 1 shows the performance of NER when the
word clusters are obtained using only the bilingual
information for different language pairs. As can
be seen, these clusters are helpful for all the lan-
guage pairs. For Turkish the F1 score improves
by 1.0 point over when there are no distributional
clusters which clearly shows that the word align-
ment information improves the clustering quality.
We now need to supplement the bilingual infor-
mation with monolingual information to see if the
improvement sustains.
We varied the weight of the bilingual objec-
tive (?) from 0.05 to 0.9 and observed the ef-
fect in NER performance on English-German lan-
guage pair. The F1 score is maximum for ? =
0.1 and decreases monotonically when ? is ei-
ther increased or decreased. This indicates that
bilingual information is helpful, but less valuable
than monolingual information. Preliminary exper-
iments showed that the value of ? = 0.1 is fairly
robust across other language pairs and hence we
fix it to that for all the experiments.
We run our bilingual clustering model (? =

0.1) across all language pairs and note the F1
scores. Table 1 (unrefined) shows that except for
Arabic-German & French-German, all other lan-
guage pairs deliver a better F1 score than only us-
ing monolingual German data. In case of Arabic-
German there is a drop in score by 0.25 points.
Although, we have observed improvement in F1
score over the monolingual case, the gains do
not reach significance according to McNemar?s
test (Dietterich, 1998).
Thus we propose to further refine the quality of
word alignment links as follows: Let x be a word
in language ? and y be a word in language ? and
let there exists an alignment link between x and
y. Recall that A(x, y) is the count of the align-
ment links between x and y observed in the par-
allel data, and A(x) and A(y) are the respective
marginal counts. Then we define an edge associ-
ation weight e(x, y) = 2?A(x,y)A(x)+A(y) This quantityis an association of the strength of the relationship
between x and y, and we use it to remove all align-
ment links whose e(x, y) is below a given thresh-
old before running the bilingual clustering model.
We vary e from 0.1 to 0.7 and observe the new F1
scores on the development data. Table 1 (refined)
shows the results obtained by our refined model.
The values shown in bold are the highest improve-
ments over the monolingual model.
For English and Turkish we observe a statisti-
cally significant improvement over the monolin-
gual model (cf. Table 1) with p < 0.007 and
p < 0.001 according to McNemar?s test. Ara-
bic improves least with just an improvement of
0.02 F1 points over the monolingual baseline. We

see that the optimal value of e changes from one
language pair to another. For French and English
e = 0.1 gives the best results whereas for Turk-
ish and Arabic e = 0.5 and for Korean e = 0.7.
Are these thresholds correlated with anything? We
suggest that higher values of e correspond to more
intrinsically noisy alignments. Since alignment
models are parameterized based on the vocabu-
laries of the languages they are aligning, larger
vocabularies are more prone to degenerate solu-
tions resulting from overfitting. So we are not
surprised to see that sparser alignments (resulting
from higher values of e) are required by languages
like Korean, while languages like French and En-
glish make due with denser alignments.
Evaluation on Test Set: We now verify our re-
sults on the test set. We take the best bilin-
gual word clustering model obtained for every lan-
guage pair (e = 0.1 for En, Fr. e = 0.5 for Ar,
Tr. e = 0.7 for Ko) and train NER classifiers
using these. Table 1 shows the performance of
German NER classifiers on the test set. All the
values shown in bold are better than the mono-
lingual baselines. English again has a statistically
significant improvement over the baseline. French
and Turkish show the next best improvements.
The English-German cluster model performs bet-
ter than the mkcls7 tool (72.83%).
4 Related Work
Our monolingual clustering model is purely distri-
butional in nature. Other extensions to word clus-
tering have incorporated morphological and or-
thographic information (Clark, 2003). The work
of Snyder and Barzilay (2010), which focused on
POS induction is very closely related. The ear-
liest work on bilingual word clustering was pro-
posed by (Och, 1999) which, like us, uses a lan-
7http://www.statmt.org/moses/giza/mkcls.html
guage modeling approach (Brown et al, 1992;
Kneser and Ney, 1993) for monolingual optimiza-
tion and a similarity function for bilingual simi-
larity. Ta?ckstro?m et al (2012) use cross-lingual
word clusters to show transfer of linguistic struc-
ture. While their clustering method is superficially
similar, the objective function is more heuristic in
nature than our information-theoretic conception
of the problem. Multilingual learning has been
applied to a number of unsupervised and super-
vised learning problems, including word sense dis-
ambiguation (Diab, 2003; Guo and Diab, 2010),
topic modeling (Mimno et al, 2009; Boyd-Graber
and Blei, 2009), and morphological segmenta-
tion (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008).
Also closely related is the technique of cross-
lingual annotation projection. This has been
applied to bootstrapping syntactic parsers (Hwa
et al, 2005; Smith and Smith, 2007; Co-
hen et al, 2011), morphology (Fraser, 2009),
tense (Schiehlen, 1998) and T/V pronoun us-
age (Faruqui and Pado?, 2012).
5 Conclusions
We presented a novel information theoretic model
for bilingual word clustering which seeks a clus-
tering with high average mutual information be-
tween clusters of adjacent words, and also high
mutual information across observed word align-
ment links. We have shown that improvement in
clustering can be obtained across a range of lan-
guage pairs, evaluated in terms of their value as
features in an extrinsic NER task. Our model can
be extended for clustering any number of given
languages together in a joint framework, and in-
corporate both monolingual and parallel data.
