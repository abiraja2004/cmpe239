Abstract 
We present discourse annotation work aimed at con- 
structing a parallel corpus of Rhetorical Structure 
trees for a collection of Japanese texts and their cor- 
responding English translations. We discuss impli- 
cations of our empirical findings for the task of text 
planning in the context of implementing multilingual 
natural anguage generation systems. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
The natural anguage generation community has em- 
phasized for a number of years the strengths of mul- 
tilingual generation (MGEN) systems (Iordanskaja 
et al, 1992; RTsner and Stede, 1992; Reiter and Mel- 
lish, 1993; Goldberg et al, 1994; Paris et al, 1995; 
Power and Scott, 1998). These strengths concern the 
reuse of knowledge, the support for early drafts in 
several anguages, the support for maintaining con- 
sistency when making changes, the support for pro- 
ducing alternative formulations, and the potential 
for producing higher quality outputs than machine 
translation. (The weaknesses concern the high-cost 
of building large, language-independent k owledge 
bases, and the dilficulty of producing high-quality. 
broad-coverage neration algorithms.) 
From an economic perspective, the more a sys- 
tem can rely on language independent modules for 
the purpose of multilingual generatiom the better. 
If an MGEN system needs to develop language de- 
pendent knowledge bases, and language dependent 
algorithms for content selection, text planning, and 
sentence planning, it-is difficult to justify its eco- 
nomic viability. However, if most of these compo- 
nents are language independent and/or much of the 
code can be re-used, an MGEN system becomes a
viable option. 
.Many of the earl3 implementations of MGEN sys- 
tems have adopted the perspective that text plan- 
ners can be implemented as language-independent 
modules (lordanskaja el, ;11., 1992: Goldberg et el., 
1994), possibly followed by a hm:aricatwn stage, 
in which discourse l.rees are re-written to refleet~ 
language-specific constraints (R6sner and Stede. 
1992; St,ede, 1999). Although such an approach may 
17 
be adequate for highly restricted text genres, such 
as weather forecasts, it usually poses problems for 
less restricted genres. Studies of instruction man- 
uals (RTsner and Stede, 1992; Delin et al, 1994: 
Delin et al, 1996) suggest hat there are variations 
with respect to the way high-level communicative 
goals  are realized across languages. For example, 
Delin et al (1994) noticed that sentences (1), (2), 
and (3), which were taken from a trilingual instruc- 
tion manual for a step-aerobics machine, yield non- 
isomorphic Rhetorical Structure (Mann and Thomp- 
son, 1988) analyses in English, French, and German 
respectively (see Figure 1). 
English: \[The stepping load can be altered I \] 
\[by loosening the locking lever 2\] \[and changing 
the position of the cylinder foota\].

Hmvever, previous.discourse ,studies do .not es- 
timate how ubiquitous uch non-isomorphic analy- 
ses are. Are the examples above an exception or 
the norm? Are non-isomorphic analyses specific 
to discourse structures built, across elementary dis- 
course units of single sentences, or do they also 
occur across sentences and paragraphs? If non- 
isomorphism is ubiquitous, how should an MGEN 
system be designed in order to effectively deal wit h 
non-isomorphic discourse structures when mapping 
knowledge bases into multiple languages? 
In this paper, we describe an experiment that was 
designed to answer these questions. To investigate

how discourse structures differ across languages, we 
manual ly built a parallel corpus of discourse trees of 
newspaper Japanese texts and their corresponding 
English translations. In section 2, we present some 
of the problems pecific to the construction of such 
a corpus. In section 3, we present our experiment 
and discuss our empirical findings. In Section 4, we 
discuss the implications of our work for the task of 
text planning, in the context of multi l ingual natural 
language generation. 
2 Towards bu i ld ing a paral le l  corpus 
of d iscourse trees: an example  
Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (4), a 
word-by-word "gloss" of it (5), and a two-sentence 
translation of it that was produced by a professional 
translator (6).

Thompson,  1988). If we analyze the text frag- 
ments closely, we will notice that in translat ing sen- 
tence (4), a professional translator chose to realize 
the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in 
text (4) corresponds roughly to unit I in text (6)); 
to realize then some of the information in Japanese 
unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (4) corresponds to unit 
2 in text (6)); to fuse then information given in units 
1, 3, and 5 in text (4) and realize it in English as 
unit 3; and so on. Also, the translator chose to re- 
package the information in the original Japanese sen- 
tence into two English sentences. 
At the elementary unit level, the correspondence 
between Japanese sentence (4) and its English trans- 
lation (6) can be represented as in (7), where j C e 
denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit 
j is realized fully in unit e; j D e denotes the fact 
that the semantic content of unit e is realized fully 
in unit. j; j = e denotes the fact that units j and e 
are semantical ly equivalent; and j ~ e denotes the 
fact that  there is a semantic overlap between units j 
and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equiv- 
alence.

Hence, tile mappings in (7) provide an explicit, rep- 
resentation of the way information is re-ordered and 
re-packaged when translated from Japanese into En- 
glish. However, when translating text, it is not only 
that information is re-packaged and re-ordered; it 
is also that the rhetorical rendering changes. What  
is realized in Japanese using an ELABORATION rela- 
tion can be realized in English using, for example, a 
CON' I 'RAST  or  a CONCESSION relation.

son (1988) the discourse structures of text frag- 
ments (4) and (6). Each discourse structure is a 
tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose 
internal nodes correspond t.o contiguous text spans. 
Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or 
SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a re- 
lation that holds between two non-overlapping text 
spans. (There are a few exceptions to this rule: some 
relations, such as the CONTRAST relation that holds 
between unit \[3\] and span \[4,.5\] in the structure of the 
English text are multinuclear.) The distinction be- 
tween nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical 
observation that the nucleus expresses what is more 
essential to the writer's intention than the satellite: 
and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is com- 
prehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice 
versa. Rhetorical relations'that end.in the.suffix :'-e". 
denote relations that correspond to embedded syn- 
tactic constituents. For example, the ELABORATION- 
OBJEC'T-ATTRIBUTE-E relation that holds between 
units 9. and 1 in the English discourse structure cor- 
responds to a restrictive relative. We chose to label 
these relations because we have noticed that they 
often dominate complex discourse trees, whose ele- 
nlentary units are fully fleshed clauses. 
If one knows the mappings at the ed~l level, 
one can determine the mappings at. the span (dis- 
course constituent) level as well. For example, us- 
19 
ing the elementary mappings in (7), one can deter- 
mine that Japanese span \[1,2\] corresponds to English 
span \[1,2\], Japanese unit \[4\] to English span \[4,5\]. 
,Japanese span \[6,7\] to English unit \[6\], Japanese 
span \[1,5\] to English span \[1,5\], and so on. As Fig- 
ure 2 shows, the CONCESSION relation that holds be- 
tween spans \[1,5\] and \[6,7\] in the Japanese tree corre- 
sponds to a similar relation that holds between span 
\[I.5\] and unit \[6\] in the English tree (modulo the fact 
that, in Japanese, the relation holds between sen- 
tence fragments, while in English it holds between 
fldl sentences). However, the TEMPORAL-AFTER re- 
lation that holds between units \[3\] and \[4\] in the 
Japanese tree is realized as a CONTRAST relation 
between unit  \[3\] and span \[4,5\] in the English tree: 
And because Japanese units \[6\] and \[7\] are fused 
into: unit \[6\] ing:nglish, the  rel,ation .ELA-BORAT.ION- 
OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E iS no longer made explicit in 
the English text. 
Assume now that it is the task of an MGEN sys- 
tem to produce from a knowledge base texts (4) 
and (6). The system will have to select, the ap- 
propriate information, generate text plans for the 
two texts, generate sentence plans, and realize them. 
Should the syst.en~ generate a text plan having a 
structure similar to the PtST analysis at. the top or 
the bottom of Figure 2"? Or something in between'? 
As one can see, the discourse trees in Figure 2 are 
quite different: they suggest hat depending on the 
output language, text plans should use different re- 
lations, different orderings of elementary units, dif- 
ferent aggregations across semantic units, etc. 
Some researchers may argue that the two RST 
analyses in Figure 2 are too specific. That  they, 
figures. 
In computing Position-Dependent (P-D) recall 
and precision figures, a Japanese span was consid- 
ered to match an English span when the Japanese 
span contained all the Japanese edus that cor- 
responded to the edus in the English span, and 
in fact, correspond t0.:text.,~plaz!s .,tha-t .l!.ave bee.n 
already refined by an aggregation module and ar- 
guably, even by a sentence planner. After all, the 
re-ordering of units 1 and 2 can be explained only 
in terms of different syntactic ontraints in Japanese 
and English. We agree with such a concern. Never- 
theless, as our experiment shows, significant differ- 
ences across discourse trees are found not only for 
trees built at the sentence level, but also for trees 
built at the paragraph and text levels. For these lev- 
els, it is difficult to explain the differences in terms 
of language-specific syntactic onstraints. Rather, it 
seems more adequate to assume that there are sig- 
nificant differences with respect o the way informa- 
tion is organized rhetorically across languages. The 
experiment described in the next section estimates 
quantitatively this difference. 
3 Exper iment  
In order to assess how similar discourse structures 
are across languages, we built manually a cor- 
pus of discourse trees for 40 Japanese texts and 
their corresponding translations. The texts, se- 
lected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White 
and O'Connell, 1994), contained on average about 
460 words. We developed a discourse annota- 
tion protocol for ,Japanese and English along the 
lines followed by Marcu et al (1999). We used 
Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order 
to manually construct he discourse structure of all 
Japanese and English texts it, the corpus. 10~. of 
the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically 
labeled by two of us. The agreement was sta- 
tistically significant (Kappa = 0.65.0 > 0.01 for 
Japanese and Kappa = 0.748,0 > 0.01 for En- 
glish (Carletta, 1996; Siegel-and Castellan, 1988)). 
The tool and the annotation protocol are available 
at. http://www, isi.edt,/~r, zarcu/softwa,-e/. For each 
pair of Japanese-English discourse, structures, we 
also built, manually an alignment file, which specified 
the correspondence b tween the edus of the Japanese 
and English texts. 
Using labeled recall and precision figures, we com- 
puted the similarity between English and Japanese 
discourse trees with respect t,o their assignment of 
edu boundaries, hierarchical spans, nuclearity, and 
rhetorical relations, Because the trees we comparod 
differ from one language to the other ill the ntnnber 
of elernent ary units, the order, of these units, and the 
way the units are grouped rectirsively into discourse 
spans, we comptlted two types of recall and precision 
, :+when :~e.J~laa~tese:~-and.~En~lish::spans -ap eared-in 
the same position linearly. For example, the En- 
glish tree in Figure 2 is characterized by 10 sub- 
sentential spans, which span across positions \[1,1\], 
\[2,2\], \[3,3\], \[4,4\], \[5,5\], \[6,6\], \[1,2\], \[4,5\], \[3,5\], and 
\[1,5\]. (Span \[1,6\] subsumes 2 sentences, so it is 
not sub-sentential.) The Japanese discourse tree has 
only 4 spans that could be matched in the same po- 
sitions with English spans, namely spans \[1,2\]. \[4,4\], 
\[5,5\], and \[1,5\]. Hence the similarity between the 
Japanese tree and the English tree with respect to 
their discourse structure below the sentence level has 
a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4 / l l  (in Figure 2, 
there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans). 
In computing Position-Independent (P-I) recall 
and precision figures, even when a Japanese span 
"floated" during the translation to a position in the 
English tree that was different from the position 
in the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision fig- 
ures are affected less than when computing Position- 
Dependent figures. The position-independent fig- 
ures reflect the intuition that if two trees tl and t2 
both have a subtree t, tl and 12 are more similar 
than if they were if they didn't share ally subtree. 
For instance, for the spans at the sub-sentential level 
in the trees in Figure 2 the position-independent 
recall is 6/10 and the position-independent preci- 
sion is 6/11 because in addition to spans \[1,2\], \[4,4\], 
\[5,5\], and \[1,5\], one can also match Japanese spat, 
\[1,1\] to English spa,, \[2,2\] and Japanese spa,, \[2,2\] 
to Japanese span \[1,1\]. The Position-Independent 
figures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing 
discourse trees. They span a wider range of values 
than the Position-Dependent figures, which enables 
a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables 
a better characterization of the differ.ences between 
Japanese and English discourse structures. 
In order to provide a better estimate of how close 
two  discourse trees were, we computed Position- 
Dependent and -Independent recall and precision fig- 
ures for the sentential evel (where units are given 
by edus and spans are given by sets of edus or single 
sentences); paragraph level (where units are given by 
sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences or 
single paragraphs): and text level (where units are 
given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets of 
paragraphs). These figures offer a detailed picture of 
how discourse structures and relations are mapped 
-from one languageto the other. Some of the differ- 
ences at the sentence level can be explained by differ- 
ences between the syntactic structures of Japanese

Table 1: Similarity of the Japanese and English discourse structures 
and English. The differences at the paragraph and 
text levels have a purely rhetorical explanation. 
As expected, when one computes the recall and 
precision figures with respect to the nuclearity and 
relation assignments, one also factors in the nucle- 
arity status and the rhetorical relation that is asso- 
ciated with each span. 
Table 1 summarizes the results (P-D and P-I 
(R)ecall and (P)recision figures) for each level (Sen- 
tence, Paragraph, and Text). It presents Recall and 
Precision figures with respect to span assignment, 
nuclearity status, and rhetorical relation labeling of 
discourse spans. The numbers in the "Weighted 
Average" line report averages of the Sentence-, 
Paragraph-, and Text-specific figures, weighted ac- 
cording to the number of units at each level. The 
numbers in the "All" line reflect recall and precision 
figures computed across the entire trees, with no at- 
tention paid t.o sentence and paragraph boundaries. 
Given the significantly different syntactic struc- 
tures of Japanese and English. we were not surprised 
by tile low recall and precision results that reflect 
the similarity between discourse trees built below 
the sentence level. However, as Table 1 shows, there 
are astonishing differences between discourse trees 
at the paragraph and text. levels as well. For exam- 
pie, the Position-Independent figures show that only 
about 62% of the sentences: and only :about 53% of 
the hierarchical spans built across sentences could be 
matched between the two corpora. When one looks 
at the nuclearity status and rhetorical relations as- 
sociated with the spans built across sentences, the 
P-I recall and precision figures drop to about 43c2~ 
and :/5~ respectively. 
The differences in recall and precision are ex- 
l)lained both by differen,-es in the way information is 
packaged rote paragraphs in the-two languages arid 
the way it is structured rhetorically both within and 
above the paragraph level. 
4 How shou ld  a mul t i l i ngua l  text  
p lanner  work?  
The results in Section 3 strongly suggest hat if one 
is to build text plans in the context of a Japanese- 
English multilingual generation system, a language- 
independent text planning module whose output is 
mapped straightforwardly into sentence plans (Ior- 
danskaja et al, 1992; Goldberg et al, 1994) will not 
do. The differences between the rhetorical structures 
of Japanese and English texts are simply too big to 
support the derivation of a unique text plan, which 
would subsume both the Japanese- and English- 
specific realizations. If we are to build MGEN sys- 
tems capable of generating rich texts in languages 
as distant as English and Japanese, we would need 
to use more sophisticated techniques. In the rest of 
this section, we discuss a set of possible approaches, 
which are consistent with work that has been carried 
out to date in the NLG field. 
4.1 Use text  p lan representat ions  that  are 
more  abst rac t  than  d iscourse trees 
Delin et al (1994) have shown that although tile 
rhetorical renderings in Figure 1 are non-isomorphic. 
dmy are alt subsumed by one .commol~, more.ab- 
stract t.ext.-plan representation language that for- 
realizes the procedural relations of Generation and 
Enablement (Goldman, 1970). One caa~ conceive of. 
text plans being represented as sequences of actions 
or hierarchies of actions and goals over which one can 
identify Generation and Enablement relations that 
hold between them. In such a framework, text plan- 
ning is carried out ill a language-independent man- 
ner. which is then followed by a rhetorical "'fleshing 
out". (Delin et al (1994) have shown how Gener- 
ation and Enablenlent relations are realized rhetor- 
ically in various languages using relations such as 
PURPOSE, 'SEQUENCE, CONDITION, and MEANS.) 
Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) suggest that the 
variability present in Delin et al's Rhetorical Struc- 
21 
ture analyses in Figure 1 can be explained by the 
inadequate mixture of intentional and semantic re- 
lations, at different levels of granularity. They pro- 
pose that discourse phenomena should be accounted 
for at a more abstract level than RST relations 
and they present a classification system in terms 
discourse-tree r writing module capable of rewriting 
P-specific discourse structures into O-specific dis- 
course structures. When generating texts in lan- 
guage P, the MGEN system works as a monolin- 
gum generator. When generating texts in language 
O, the MGEN system generates a text plan in lan- 
of "stratification", ..'!me?afunction?., ,,and .::p~radig,: ........ guage.-~, xnapsitdr~to.=taaag,uageO.,~ anti then ~proceeds - .. 
matic/syntagmatic axiality" that enables one to rep- 
resent discourse structures at multiple levels of ab- 
straction. 
Adopting such an approach could be an extremely 
rewarding enterprise. Unfortunately, the research 
of Delin et al (1994) and Bateman and Rond- 
huis (1997) cannot be applied yet to unrestricted o- 
mains. Generation and Enablement are only two of 
the abstract relations that can hold between actions 
and goals. And some texts, such as descriptions, are 
difficult to characterize only in terms of actions and 
goals. Building a "complete" taxonomy of such ab- 
stract relations and identifying adequate mappings 
between there relations and rhetorical relations are 
still open problems. 
4.2 Derive a language- independent 
discourse structure, and then l inearize 
it 
RSsner and Stede (1992) and Stede (1999) assume 
that a discourse representation g la Mann and 
Thompson imposes no contraints on the linear order 
of the leaves. For tile purpose of multilingual text 
planning, one can, hence, assume that a language- 
independent text planner derives first a language- 
independent rhetorical structure and then linearizes 
it, i.e., transforms it to make it language specific. 
The transformations that RSsner and Stede have ap- 
plied concern primarily re-orderings of the children 
of some nodes and re-assignment of rhetorical rela- 
tion labels. But given, for example, tile significant 
differences between the discourse structures in Fig- 
ure 2, it is difficult to envision what the language- 
independent text plan might look like. It is deft- 
nitely possible to conceive of such a text plan rep- 
resentation. However, the linearization module will 
need then to be much more sophisticated: it will 
need to be able to rewrite full structures, re-order 
constituents, aggregate_across possibly non-adjacent 
units, etc. 
4.3 hnp lement  a text  p lann ing  a lgor i thm 
for one language only. For all o ther  
languages,  dev ise d i scourse - t ree  
rewr i t ing  modu les  
In this approach, the system developer assigns a pre- 
ferrential status to one of the languages that are 
to be handled I) 3 ' the MGEN system. Lot's call 
this language P. The system developer implenlents 
text planning algorithms only for this language. For 
any other language O, the developer itnplements a 
22 
further with the sentence planning and realization 
stages. Marcu et al (2000) present and evaluate a 
discourse-tree r writing algorithm that exploits ma- 
chine learning methods in order to map Japanese 
discourse trees into discourse trees that resemble 
English-specific renderings. 
The advantage of such an approach is that the 
tree-rewriting modules can be also used in the con- 
text of machine translation systems in order to re- 
package and re-organize the input text rhetorically, 
to reflect constraints pecific to the target language. 
The disadvantage is that, from an NLG perspective, 
there is no guarantee that such a system could pro- 
duce better results than a system that implements 
language-dependent text planning modules. 
4.4 Derive language-dependent  text plans 
Another viable approach is to acknowledge that 
text plans vary significantly across languages and, 
therefore, should be derived by language-dependent 
planners. To this end, one could use both top- 
down (How, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993) and 
bottom-up (Marcu, t997; Mellish et al, 1998) text 
planning algorithms. The advantage of this ap- 
proach is that it has the potential of producing trees 
that reflect tile peculiarities specific to any language. 
The disadvantage is that only the text planning al- 
gorithms are general: the plan operators and the 
rhetorical relations they operate with are language- 
dependent, and hence, more expensive to develop 
and maintain. 
4.5 Discuss ion 
Depending oil tile languages and text genres it op- 
erates with, all MGEN system may get away with 
a language-independent text planner. However, 
for sophisticated genres and distant languages, im- 
plementing a language-independent planner that is 
straightforwardly'mapped i:nto sentence, plans does 
not appear to be a felicitous solution. We enu- 
merated four possible alternatives for addressing the 
text planning problem in an MGEN system. Each 
of tile approaches has its own pluses and minuses. 
Which will eventually win in large-scale deployable 
MGEN systems remains an open question.
