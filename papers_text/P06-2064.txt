Abstract
We propose a novel method for automat-
ically interpreting compound nouns based
on a predefined set of semantic relations.
First we map verb tokens in sentential con-
texts to a fixed set of seed verbs using
WordNet::Similarity and Moby?s
Thesaurus. We then match the sentences
with semantic relations based on the se-
mantics of the seed verbs and grammatical
roles of the head noun and modifier. Based
on the semantics of the matched sentences,
we then build a classifier using TiMBL.
The performance of our final system at in-
terpreting NCs is 52.6%.
1 Introduction
The interpretation of noun compounds (hereafter,
NCs) such as apple pie or family car is a well-
established sub-task of language understanding.
Conventionally, the NC interpretation task is de-
fined in terms of unearthing the underspecified se-
mantic relation between the head noun and modi-
fier(s), e.g. pie and apple respectively in the case
of apple pie.
NC interpretation has been studied in the con-
text of applications including question-answering
and machine translation (Moldovan et al, 2004;
Cao and Li, 2002; Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004;
Lauer, 1995). Recent work on the automatic/semi-
automatic interpretation of NCs (e.g., Lapata
(2002), Rosario and Marti (2001), Moldovan et al
(2004) and Kim and Baldwin (2005)) has made as-
sumptions about the scope of semantic relations or
restricted the domain of interpretation. This makes
it difficult to gauge the general-purpose utility of
the different methods. Our method avoids any
such assumptions while outperforming previous
methods.
In seminal work on NC interpretation, Finin
(1980) tried to interpret NCs based on hand-coded
rules. Vanderwende (1994) attempted the auto-
matic interpretation of NCs using hand-written
rules, with the obvious cost of manual interven-
tion. Fan et al (2003) estimated the knowledge
required to interpret NCs and claimed that perfor-
mance was closely tied to the volume of data ac-
quired.
In more recent work, Barker and Szpakowicz
(1998) used a semi-automatic method for NC in-
terpretation in a fixed domain. Lapata (2002)
developed a fully automatic method but focused
on nominalizations, a proper subclass of NCs.1
Rosario and Marti (2001) classified the nouns in
medical texts by tagging hierarchical information
using neural networks. Moldovan et al (2004)
used the word senses of nouns based on the do-
main or range of interpretation of an NC, leading
to questions of scalability and portability to novel
domains/NC types. Kim and Baldwin (2005) pro-
posed a simplistic general-purpose method based
on the lexical similarity of unseen NCs with train-
ing instances.
The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic
method for interpreting NCs based on semantic re-
lations. We interpret semantic relations relative to
a fixed set of constructions involving the modifier
and head noun and a set of seed verbs for each
semantic relation: e.g. (the) family owns (a) car
is taken as evidence for family car being an in-
stance of the POSSESSOR relation. We then at-
tempt to map all instances of the modifier and head
noun as the heads of NPs in a transitive senten-
tial context onto our set of constructions via lex-
ical similarity over the verb, to arrive at an inter-
pretation: e.g. we would hope to predict that pos-
sess is sufficiently similar to own that (the) family
possesses (a) car would be recognised as support-
1With nominalizations, the head noun is deverbal, and in
the case of Lapata (2002), nominalisations are assumed to
be interpretable as the modifier being either the subject (e.g.
child behavior) or object (e.g. car lover) of the base verb of
the head noun.

ing evidence for the POSSESSOR relation. We use
a supervised classifier to combine together the evi-
dence contributed by individual sentential contexts
of a given modifier?head noun combination, and
arrive at a final interpretation for a given NC.
Mapping the actual verbs in sentences to ap-
propriate seed verbs is obviously crucial to the
success of our method. This is particularly im-
portant as there is no guarantee that we will find
large numbers of modifier?head noun pairings in
the sorts of sentential contexts required by our
method, nor that we will find attested instances
based on the seed verbs. Thus an error in map-
ping an attested verb to the seed verbs could result
in a wrong interpretation or no classification at all.
In this paper, we experiment with the use of Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) and word clusters (based on
Moby?s Thesaurus) in mapping attested verbs to
the seed verbs. We also make use of CoreLex in
dealing with the semantic relation TIME and the
RASP parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) to de-
termine the dependency structure of corpus data.
The data source for our set of NCs is binary
NCs (i.e. NCs with a single modifier) from the
Wall Street Journal component of the Penn Tree-
bank. We deliberately choose to ignore NCs with
multiple modifiers on the grounds that: (a) 88.4%
of NC types in the Wall Street Journal component
of the Penn Treebank and 90.6% of NC types in
the British National Corpus are binary; and (b) we
expect to be able to interpret NCs with multiple
modifiers by decomposing them into binary NCs.
Another simplifying assumption we make is to re-
move NCs incorporating proper nouns since: (a)
the lexical resources we employ in this research
do not contain them in large numbers; and (b)
there is some doubt as to whether the set of seman-
tic relations required to interpret NCs incorporat-
ing proper nouns is that same as that for common
nouns.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
takes a brief look at the semantics of NCs and the
basic idea behind the work. Section 3 details the
set of NC semantic relations that is used in our
research, Section 4 presents an extended discus-
sion of our approach, Section 5 briefly explains the
tools we use, Section 6.1 describes how we gather
and process the data, Section 6.2 explains how we
map the verbs to seed verbs, and Section 7 and
Section 8 present the results and analysis of our
approach. Finally we conclude our work in Sec-
tion 9.
2 Motivation
The semantic relation in NCs is the relation be-
tween the head noun (denoted ?H?) and the mod-
ifier(s) (denoted ?M?). We can find this semantic
relation expressed in certain sentential construc-
tions involving the head noun and modifier.
(1) family car
CASE: family owns the car.
FORM: H own M
RELATION: POSSESSOR
(2) student protest
CASE: protest is performed by student.
FORM: M is performed by H
RELATION: AGENT
In the examples above, the semantic relation
(e.g. POSSESSOR) provides an interpretation of
how the head noun and modifiers relate to each
other, and the seed verb (e.g. own) provides a para-
phrase evidencing that relation. For example, in
the case of family car, the family is the POSSES-
SOR of the car, and in student protest, student(s)
are the AGENT of the protest. Note that voice is im-
portant in aligning sentential contexts with seman-
tic relations. For instance, family car can be repre-
sented as car is owned by family (passive) and stu-
dent protest as student performs protest (active).
The exact nature of the sentential context varies
with different synonyms of the seed verbs.
(3) family car
CASE: Synonym=have/possess/belong to
FORM: H own M
RELATION: POSSESSOR
(4) student protest
CASE: Synonym=act/execute/do
FORM: M is performed by H
RELATION: AGENT
The verb own in the POSSESSOR relation has
the synonyms have, possess and belong to. In
the context of have and possess, the form of re-
lation would be same as the form with verb, own.
However, in the context of belong to, family car
492
would mean that the car belongs to family. Thus,
even when the voice of the verb is the same
(voice=active), the grammatical role of the head
noun and modifier can change.
In our approach we map the actual verbs in sen-
tences containing the head noun and modifiers to
seed verbs corresponding to the relation forms.
The set of seed verbs contains verbs representa-
tive of each semantic relation form. We chose two
sets of seed verbs of size 57 and 84, to examine
how the coverage of actual verbs by seed verbs af-
fects the performance of our method. Initially, we
manually chose a set of 60 seed verbs. We then
added synonyms from Moby?s thesaurus for some
of the 60 verbs. Finally, we filtered verbs from the
two expanded sets, since these verbs occur very
frequently in the corpus (as this might skew the
results). The set of seed verbs {have, own, pos-
sess, belong to} are in the set of 57 seed verbs,
and {acquire, grab, occupy} are added to the set
of 84 seed verbs; all correspond to the POSSES-
SOR relation.
For each relation, we generate a set of con-
structional templates associating a subset of seed
verbs with appropriate grammatical relations for
the head noun and modifier. Examples for POS-
SESSOR are:
S({have, own, possess}V,M SUBJ,H OBJ) (5)
S({belong to}V,H SUBJ,M OBJ) (6)
where V is the set of seed verbs, M is the modifier
and H is the head noun.
Two relations which do not map readily onto
seed verbs are TIME (e.g. winter semester) and
EQUATIVE (e.g. composer arranger). Here, we
rely on an independent set of contextual evidence,
as outlined in Section 6.1.
Through matching actual verbs attested in cor-
pus data onto seed verbs, we can match sentences
with relations (see Section 6.2). Using this method
we can identify the matching relation forms of se-
mantic relations to decide the semantic relation for
NCs.
3 Semantic Relations in Compound
Nouns
While there has been wide recognition of the need
for a system of semantic relations with which to
classify NCs, there is still active debate as to what
the composition of that set should be, or indeed

whether it is reasonable to expect that all NCs
should be interpretable with a fixed set of semantic
relations.
Based on the pioneering work on Levi (1979)
and Finin (1980), there have been efforts in com-
putational linguistics to arrive at largely task-
specific sets of semantic relations, driven by the
annotation of a representative sample of NCs from
a given corpus type (Vanderwende, 1994; Barker
and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and Marti, 2001;
Moldovan et al, 2004). In this paper, we use the
set of 20 semantic relations defined by Barker and
Szpakowicz (1998), rather than defining a new set
of relations. The main reasons we chose this set
are: (a) that it clearly distinguishes between the
head noun and modifiers, and (b) there is clear
documentation of each relation, which is vital for
NC annotation effort. The one change we make
to the original set of 20 semantic relations is to ex-
clude the PROPERTY relation since it is too general
and a more general form of several other relations
including MATERIAL (e.g. apple pie).
4 Method
Figure 1 outlines the system architecture of our
approach. We used three corpora: the Brown
corpus (as contained in the Penn Treebank), the
Wall Street Journal corpus (also taken from the
Penn treebank), and the written component of the
British National Corpus (BNC). We first parsed
each of these corpora using RASP (Briscoe and
Carroll, 2002), and identified for each verb to-
ken the voice, head nouns of the subject and
object, and also, for each PP attached to that
verb, the head preposition and head noun of the
493
NP (hereafter, PPN). Next, for our test NCs, we
identified all verbs for which the modifier and
head noun co-occur as subject, object, or PPN.
We then mapped these verbs to seed verbs us-
ing WordNet::Similarity and Moby?s The-
saurus (see Section 5 for details). Finally, we iden-
tified the corresponding relation for each seed verb
and selected the best-fitting semantic relation us-
ing a classifier. To evaluate our approach, we built
a classifier using TiMBL (Daelemans et al, 2004).
5 Resources
In this section, we outline the tools and resources
employed in our method.
As our parser, we used RASP, generating a
dependency representation for the most probable
parse for each sentence. Note that RASP also lem-
matises all words in a POS-sensitive manner.
To map actual verbs onto seed verbs,
we experimented with two resources:
WordNet::Similarity and Moby?s the-
saurus. WordNet::Similarity2 is an open
source software package that allows the user
to measure the semantic similarity or related-
ness between two words (Patwardhan et al,
2003). Of the many methods implemented in
WordNet::Similarity, we report on results
for one path-based method (WUP, Wu and Palmer
(1994)), one content-information based method
(JCN, Jiang and Conrath (1998)) and two semantic
relatedness methods (LESK, Banerjee and Peder-
sen (2003), and VECTOR, (Patwardhan, 2003)).
We also used a random similarity-generating
method as a baseline (RANDOM).
The second semantic resource we use for verb-
mapping method is Moby?s thesaurus. Moby?s
thesaurus is based on Roget?s thesaurus, and con-
tains 30K root words, and 2.5M synonyms and re-
lated words. Since the direct synonyms of seed
verbs have limited coverage over the set of sen-
tences used in our experiment, we also experi-
mented with using second-level indirect synonyms
of seed verbs.
In order to deal with the TIME relation, we used
CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998). CoreLex is based on a
unified approach to systematic polysemy and the
semantic underspecification of nouns, and derives
from WordNet 1.5. It contains 45 basic CoreLex
types, systematic polysemous classes and 39,937
nouns with tags.

As mentioned earlier, we built our supervised
classifier using TiMBL.
6 Data Collection
6.1 Data Processing
To test our method, we extracted 2,166 NC types
from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) component of
the Penn Treebank. We additionally extracted sen-
tences containing the head noun and modifier in
pre-defined constructional contexts from the amal-
gam of: (1) the Brown Corpus subset contained
in the Penn Treebank, (2) the WSJ portion of the
Penn Treebank, and (3) the British National Cor-
pus (BNC). Note that while these pre-defined con-
structional contexts are based on the contexts in
which our seed verbs are predicted to correlate
with a given semantic relation, we instances of all
verbs occurring in those contexts. For example,
based on the construction in Equation 5, we ex-
tract all instances of S(Vi,M SUBJj ,H OBJj ) for all
verbs Vi and all instances of NCj = (Mj ,Hj) in
our dataset.
Two annotators tagged the 2,166 NC types in-
dependently at 52.3% inter-annotator agreement,
and then met to discus all contentious annotations
and arrive at a mutually-acceptable gold-standard
annotation for each NC. The Brown, WSJ and
BNC data was pre-parsed with RASP, and sen-
tences were extracted which contained the head
noun and modifier of one of our 2,166 NCs in sub-
ject or object position, or as (head) noun within the
NP of an PP. After extracting these sentences, we
counted the frequencies of the different modifier?
head noun pairs, and filtered out: (a) all construc-
tional contexts not involving a verb contained in
WordNet 2.0, and (b) all NCs for which the modi-
fier and head noun did not co-occur in at least five
sentential contexts. This left us with a total of 453
NCs for training and testing. The combined total
number of sentential contexts for our 453 NCs was
7,714, containing 1,165 distinct main verbs.
We next randomly split the NC data into 80%
training data and 20% test data. The final number
of test NCs is 88; the final number of training NCs
varies depending on the verb-mapping method.
As noted in Section 2, the relations TIME and
EQUATIVE are not associated with seed verbs. For
TIME, rather than using contextual evidence, we
simply flag the possibility of a TIME if the modifier
is found to occur in the TIME class of CoreLex. In
the case of TIME, we consider coordinated occur-

rences of the modifier and head noun (e.g. coach
and player for player coach) as evidence for the
relation.3 We thus separately collate statistics
from coordinated NPs for each NC, and from this
compute a weight for each NC based on mutual
information:
TIME(NCi) = ?log2
freq(coord(Mi, Hi))
freqMi ? freq(Hi)
(7)
where Mi and Hi are the modifier and head of
NCi, respectively, and freq(coord(Mi,Hi)) is the
frequency of occurrence of Mi and Hi in coordi-
nated NPs.
Finally, we calculate a normalised weight for
each seed verb by determining the proportion of
head verbs each seed verb occurs with.
6.2 Verb Mapping
The sentential contexts gathered from corpus
data contain a wide range of verbs, not just
the seed verbs. To map the verbs onto seed
verbs, and hence estimate which semantic rela-
tion(s) each is a predictor of, we experimented
with two different methods. First we used the
WordNet::Similarity package to calculate
the similarity between a given verb and each
of the seed verbs, experimenting with the 5
methods mentioned in Section 5. Second, we
used Moby?s thesaurus to extract both direct syn-
onyms (D-SYNONYM) and a combination of direct
and second-level indirect synonyms of verbs (I-
SYNONYM), and from this, calculate the closest-
matching seed verb(s) for a given verb.
Figure 2 depicts the procedure for mapping
verbs in constructional contexts onto the seed
verbs. Verbs found in the various contexts in the

NPs is considered to be irrelevant, i.e. player and coach and

corpus (on the left side of the figure) map onto one
or more seed verbs, which in turn map onto one
or more semantic relations.4 We replace all non-
seed verbs in the corpus data with the seed verb(s)
they map onto, potentially increasing the number
of corpus instances.
Since direct (i.e. level 1) synonyms from
Moby?s thesaurus are not sufficient to map all
verbs onto seed verbs, we also include second-
level (i.e. level 2) synonyms, expanding from di-
rect synonyms. Table 1 shows the coverage of
sentences for test NCs, in which D indicates direct
synonyms and I indicates indirect synonyms.
7 Evaluation
We evaluated our method over both 17 semantic
relations (without EQUATIVE and TIME) and the full
19 semantic relations, due to the low frequency
and lack of verb-based constructional contexts for
EQUATIVE and TIME, as indicated in Table 2. Note
that the test data set is the same for both sets of
semantic relations, but that the training data in
the case of 17 semantic relations will not con-
tain any instances for the EQUATIVE and TIME re-
lations, meaning that all such test instances will
be misclassified. The baseline for all verb map-
ping methods is a simple majority-class classifier,
which leads to an accuracy of 42.4% for the TOPIC
relation. In evaluation, we use two different val-
ues for our method: Count and Weight. Count
is based on the raw number of corpus instances,
while Weight employs the seed verb weight de-
scribed in Section 6.1.
4There is only one instance of a seed verb mapping to
multiple semantic relations, namely perform which corre-
sponds to the two relations AGENT and OBJECT.

Table 3: Results of combining the proposed method and with the method of Kim and Baldwin (2005)
As noted above, we excluded all NCs for which
we were unable to find at least 5 instances of the
modifier and head noun in an appropriate senten-
tial context. This exclusion reduced the original
set of 2,166 NCs to only 453, meaning that the
proposed method is unable to classify up to 80% of
NCs. For real-world applications, a method which
is only able to arrive at a classification for 20% of
instances is clearly of limited utility, and we need
some way of expanding the coverage of the pro-
posed method. This is achieved by adapting the
similarity method proposed by Kim and Baldwin
(2005) to our task, wherein we use lexical simi-
larity to identify the nearest-neighbour NC for a
given NC, and classify the given NC according to
the classification for the nearest-neighbour. The
results for the combined method are presented in
Table 3.
8 Discussion
For the basic method, as presented in Table 2, the
classifier produced similar results over the 17 se-
mantic relations to the 19 semantic relations. Us-
ing data from Weight and Count for both 17 and
19 semantic relations, the classifier achieved the
best performance with VECTOR (context vector-
based distributional similarity), followed by JCN
and LESK. The main reason is that VECTOR is
more conservative than the other methods at map-
ping (original) verbs onto seed verbs, i.e. the aver-
age number of seed verbs a given verb maps onto
is small. For the other methods, the semantics of
the original sentences are often not preserved un-
der verb mapping, introducing noise to the classi-
fication task.
Comparing the two sets of semantic relations
(17 vs. 19), the set with more semantic rela-
tions achieved slightly better performance in most
cases. A detailed breakdown of the results re-
vealed that TIME both has an above-average clas-
sification accuracy and is associated with a rela-
tively large number of test NCs, while EQUATIVE
has a below-average classification accuracy but is
associated with relatively few instances.
While an increased number of seed verbs gener-
ates more training instances under verb mapping,
it is imperative that the choice of seed verbs be
made carefully so that they not introduce noise
into the classifier and reducing overall perfor-
mance. Figure 4 is an alternate representation of
the numbers from Table 2, with results for each in-
dividual method over 57 and 84 seed verbs juxta-
posed for each of Count andWeight. From this, we
get the intriguing result that Count generally per-
forms better over fewer seed verbs, while Weight
performs better over more seed verbs.

Table 4: Results for the method of Kim and Baldwin (2005) over the test set used in this research
For the experiment where we combine our
method with that of Kim and Baldwin (2005), as
presented in Table 3, we find a similar pattern of
results to the proposed method. Namely, VECTOR
and LESK achieve the best performance, with mi-
nor variations in the absolute performance relative
to the original method but the best results for each
relation set actually dropping marginally over the
original method. This drop is not surprising when
we consider that we use an imperfect method to
identify the nearest neighbour for an NC for which
we are unable to find corpus instances in sufficient
numbers, and then a second imperfect method to
classify the instance.
Compared to previous work, our method pro-
duces reasonably stable performance when op-
erated over the open-domain data with small
amounts of training data. Rosario and Marti
(2001) achieved about 60% using a neural net-
work in a closed domain, Moldovan et al (2004)
achieved 43% using word sense disambiguation
of the head noun and modifier over open domain
data, and Kim and Baldwin (2005) produced 53%
using lexical similarities of the head noun and
modifier (using the same relation set, but evaluated
over a different dataset). The best result achieved
by our system was 52.6% over open-domain data,
using a general-purpose relation set.
To get a better understanding of how our
method compares with that of Kim and Baldwin
(2005), we evaluated the method of Kim and Bald-
win (2005) over the same data set as used in this
research, the results of which are presented in Ta-
ble 4. The relative results for the different sim-
ilarity metrics mirror those reported in Kim and
Baldwin (2005). WUP produced the best perfor-
mance at 47-48% for the two relation sets, sig-
nificantly below the accuracy of our method at
53.3%. Perhaps more encouraging is the result
that the combined method?where we classify at-
tested instances according to the proposed method,
and classify unattested instances according to the
nearest-neighbour method of Kim and Baldwin
(2005) and the classifications from the proposed
method?outperforms the method of Kim and
Baldwin (2005). That is, the combined method
has the coverage of the method of Kim and Bald-
win (2005), but inherits the higher accuracy of the
method proposed herein. Having said this, the per-
formance of the Kim and Baldwin (2005) method
over PRODUCT, TOPIC, LOCATION and SOURCE is
superior to that of our method. In this sense,
we believe that alternate methods of hybridisation
may lead to even better results.
Finally, we wish to point out that the method
as presented here is still relatively immature, with
considerable scope for improvement. In its current
form, we do not weight the different seed verbs
497
based on their relative similarity to the original
verb. We also use the same weight and frequency
for each seed verb relative to a given relation, de-
spite seed verbs being more indicative of a given
relation and also potentially occurring more often
in the corpus. For instance, possess is more related
to POSSESSOR than occupy. Also possess occurs
more often in the corpus than belong to. As future
work, we intend to investigate whether allowances
for these considerations can improve the perfor-
mance of our method.
9 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a method for au-
tomatically interpreting noun compounds based
on seed verbs indicative of each semantic re-
lation. For a given modifier and head noun,
our method extracted corpus instances of the
two nouns in a range of constructional contexts,
and then mapped the original verbs onto seed
verbs based on lexical similarity derived from
WordNet::Similarity, and Moby?s The-
saurus. These instances were then fed into the
TiMBL learner to build a classifier. The best-
performing method was VECTOR, which is a con-
text vector distributional similarity method. We
also experimented with varying numbers of seed
verbs, and found that generally the more seed
verbs, the better the performance. Overall, the
best-performing system achieved an accuracy of
52.6% with 84 seed verbs and the VECTOR verb-
mapping method.
