Abstract
Although researchers have conducted exten-
sive studies on relation extraction in the last
decade, supervised approaches are still limited
because they require large amounts of training
data to achieve high performances. To build
a relation extractor without significant anno-
tation effort, we can exploit cross-lingual an-
notation projection, which leverages parallel
corpora as external resources for supervision.
This paper proposes a novel graph-based pro-
jection approach and demonstrates the mer-
its of it by using a Korean relation extrac-
tion system based on projected dataset from
an English-Korean parallel corpus.
1 Introduction
Relation extraction aims to identify semantic rela-
tions of entities in a document. Although many
supervised machine learning approaches have been
successfully applied to relation extraction tasks (Ze-
lenko et al., 2003; Kambhatla, 2004; Bunescu and
Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006), applications of
these approaches are still limited because they re-
quire a sufficient number of training examples to ob-
tain good extraction results. Several datasets that
provide manual annotations of semantic relation-
ships are available from MUC (Grishman and Sund-
heim, 1996) and ACE (Doddington et al., 2004)
projects, but these datasets contain labeled training
examples in only a few major languages, includ-
ing English, Chinese, and Arabic. Although these
datasets encourage the development of relation ex-
tractors for these major languages, there are few la-
beled training samples for learning new systems in
other languages, such as Korean. Because manual
annotation of semantic relations for such resource-
poor languages is very expensive, we instead con-
sider weakly supervised learning techniques (Riloff
and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000;
Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006) to learn the rela-
tion extractors without significant annotation efforts.
But these techniques still face cost problems when
preparing quality seed examples, which plays a cru-
cial role in obtaining good extractions.
Recently, some researchers attempted to use ex-
ternal resources, such as treebank (Banko et al.,
2007) and Wikipedia (Wu and Weld, 2010), that
were not specially constructed for relation extraction
instead of using task-specific training or seed exam-
ples. We previously proposed to leverage parallel
corpora as a new kind of external resource for rela-
tion extraction (Kim et al., 2010). To obtain training
examples in the resource-poor target language, this
approach exploited a cross-lingual annotation pro-
jection by propagating annotations that were gener-
ated by a relation extraction system in a resource-
rich source language. In this approach, projected
annotations were determined in a single pass pro-
cess by considering only alignments between entity
candidates; we call this action direct projection.
In this paper, we propose a graph-based projec-
tion approach for weakly supervised relation extrac-
tion. This approach utilizes a graph that is con-
stucted with both instance and context information
and that is operated in an iterative manner. The goal
of our graph-based approach is to improve the ro-
bustness of the extractor with respect to errors that
are generated and accumulated by preprocessors.

2 Cross-lingual Annotation Projection for
Relation Extraction
Relation extraction can be considered to be a classi-
fication problem by the following classifier:
f
(
ei, ej
)
=
{
1 if ei and ej have a relation,
?1 otherwise. ,
where ei and ej are entities in a sentence.
Cross-lingual annotation projection intends to
learn an extractor ft for good performance with-
out significant effort toward building resources for
a resource-poor target language Lt. To accomplish
that goal, the method automatically creates a set of
annotated text for ft, utilizing a well-made extractor
fs for a resource-rich source language Ls and a par-
allel corpus of Ls and Lt. Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of annotation projection for relation extraction
with a bi-text in Lt Korean and Ls English. Given an
English sentence, an instance ?Barack Obama, Hon-
olulu? is extracted as positive. Then, its translational
counterpart ?beo-rak-o-ba-ma, ho-nol-rul-ru? in the
Korean sentence also has a positive annotation by
projection.
Early studies in cross-lingual annotation projec-
tion were accomplished for various natural lan-
guage processing tasks (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001;
Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Zitouni and
Florian, 2008; Pado and Lapata, 2009). These stud-
ies adopted a simple direct projection strategy that
propagates the annotations in the source language
sentences to word-aligned target sentences, and a
target system can bootstrap from these projected an-
notations.
For relation extraction, the direct projection strat-
egy can be formularized as follows: ft
(
eit, e
j
t
)
=
fs
(
A(eit), A(e
j
t )
)
, where A(et) is the aligned entity
of et. However, these automatic annotations can be
unreliable because of source text mis-classification
and word alignment errors; thus, it can cause a criti-
cal falling-off in the annotation projection quality.
Although some noise reduction strategies for pro-
jecting semantic relations were proposed (Kim et al.,
2010), the direct projection approach is still vulner-
able to erroneous inputs generated by submodules.
We note two main causes for this limitation: (1)
the direct projection approach considers only align-
ments between entity candidates, and it does not
consider any contextual information; and, (2) it is
performed by a single pass process. To solve both of
these problems at once, we propose a graph-based
projection approach for relation extraction.
3 Graph Construction
The most crucial factor in the success of graph-
based learning approaches is how to construct a
graph that is appropriate for the target task. Das
and Petrov (Das and Petrov, 2011) proposed a graph-
based bilingual projection of part-of-speech tagging
by considering the tagged words in the source lan-
guage as labeled examples and connecting them to
the unlabeled words in the target language, while re-
ferring to the word alignments. Graph construction
for projecting semantic relationships is more com-
plicated than part-of-speech tagging because the unit
instance of projection is a pair of entities and not a
word or morpheme that is equivalent to the align-
ment unit.
3.1 Graph Vertices
To construct a graph for a relation projection, we
define two types of vertices: instance vertices V and
context vertices U .
Instance vertices are defined for all pairs of en-
tity candidates in the source and target languages.
Each instance vertex has a soft label vector Y =
[ y+ y? ], which contains the probabilities that
the instance is positive or negative, respectively. The
larger the y+ value, the more likely the instance has
a semantic relationship. The initial label values of an
instance vertex vijs ? Vs for the instance
?
eis, e
j
s
?
in
the source language are assigned based on the con-
fidence score of the extractor fs. With respect to the
target language, every instance vertex vijt ? Vt has
49
the same initial values of 0.5 in both y+ and y?.
The other type of vertices, context vertices, are
used for identifying relation descriptors that are con-
textual subtexts that represent semantic relationships
of the positive instances. Because the characteristics
of these descriptive contexts vary depending on the
language, context vertices should be defined to be
language-specific. In the case of English, we define
the context vertex for each trigram that is located be-
tween a given entity pair that is semantically related.
If the context vertices Us for the source language
sentences are defined, then the units of context in
the target language can also be created based on the
word alignments. The aligned counterpart of each
source language context vertex is used for generat-
ing a context vertex uit ? Ut in the target language.
Each context vertex us ? Us and ut ? Ut also has
y+ and y?, which represent how likely the context
is to denote semantic relationships. The probability
values for all of the context vertices in both of the
languages are initially assigned to y+ = y? = 0.5.
3.2 Edge Weights
The graph for our graph-based projection is con-
structed by connecting related vertex pairs by
weighted edges. If a given pair of vertices is likely to
have the same label, then the edge connecting these
vertices should have a large weight value.
We define three types of edges according to com-
binations of connected vertices. The first type of
edges consists of connections between an instance
vertex and a context vertex in the same language.
For a pair of an instance vertex vi,j and a context
vertex uk, these vertices are connected if the context
sequence of vi,j contains uk as a subsequence. If
vij is matched to uk, the edge weight w
(
vi,j , uk)
)
is assigned to 1. Otherwise, it should be 0.
Another edge category is for the pairs of context
vertices in a language. Because each context vertex
is considered to be an n-gram pattern in our work,
the weight value for each edge of this type represents
the pattern similarity between two context vertices.
The edge weight w(uk, ul) is computed by Jaccard?s
coefficient between uk and ul.
While the previous two categories of edges are
concerned with monolingual connections, the other
type addresses bilingual alignments of context ver-
tices between the source language and the target lan-
guage. We define the weight for a bilingual edge
connecting uks and ult as the relative frequency of
alignments, as follows:
w(uks , u
l
t) = count
(
uks , u
l
t
)
/
?
umt
count
(
uks , u
m
t
)
,
where count (us, ut) is the number of alignments
between us and ut across the whole parallel corpus.
4 Label Propagation
To induce labels for all of the unlabeled vertices on
the graph constructed in Section 3, we utilize the
label propagation algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani,
2002), which is a graph-based semi-supervised
learning algorithm.
First, we construct an n ? n matrix T that rep-
resents transition probabilities for all of the vertex
pairs. After assigning all of the values on the ma-
trix, we normalize the matrix for each row, to make
the element values be probabilities. The other input
to the algorithm is an n ? 2 matrix Y , which indi-
cates the probabilities of whether a given vertex vi is
positive or not. The matrix T and Y are initialized
by the values described in Section 3.
For the input matrices T and Y , label propagation
is performed by multiplying the two matrices, to up-
date the Y matrix. This multiplication is repeated
until Y converges or until the number of iterations
exceeds a specific number. The Y matrix, after fin-
ishing its iterations, is considered to be the result of
the algorithm.
5 Implementation
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph-based
projection approach for relation extraction, we de-
veloped a Korean relation extraction system that was
trained with projected annotations from English re-
sources. We used an English-Korean parallel cor-
pus 1 that contains 266,892 bi-sentence pairs in En-
glish and Korean. We obtained 155,409 positive in-
stances from the English sentences using an off-the-
shelf relation extraction system, ReVerb 2 (Fader et
al., 2011).

The English sentence annotations in the parallel
corpus were then propagated into the correspond-
ing Korean sentences. We used the GIZA++ soft-
ware 3 (Och and Ney, 2003) to obtain the word align-
ments for each bi-sentence in the parallel corpus.
The graph-based projection was performed by the
Junto toolkit 4 with the maximum number of itera-
tions of 10 for each execution.
Projected instances were utilized as training ex-
amples to learn the Korean relation extractor. We
built a tree kernel-based support vector machine
model using SVM-Light 5 (Joachims, 1998) and
Tree Kernel tools 6 (Moschitti, 2006). In our model,
we adopted the subtree kernel method for the short-
est path dependency kernel (Bunescu and Mooney,
2005).
6 Evaluation
The experiments were performed on the manu-
ally annotated Korean test dataset. The dataset
was built following the approach of Bunescu and
Mooney (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). The dataset
consists of 500 sentences for four relation types: Ac-
quisition, Birthplace, Inventor of, and Won Prize. Of
these, 278 sentences were annotated as positive in-
stances.
The first experiment aimed to compare two sys-
tems constructed by the direct projection (Kim et al.,
2010) and graph-based projection approach. Table 1
shows the performances of the relation extraction of
the two systems. The graph-based system achieved
better performances in precision and recall than the

system with direct projection for all of the four re-
lation types. It outperformed the baseline system by
an F-measure of 3.63.
To demonstrate the merits of our work against
other approaches based on monolingual external re-
sources, we performed comparisons with the fol-
lowing two baselines: heuristic-based (Banko et
al., 2007) and Wikipedia-based approaches (Wu and
Weld, 2010). The heuristic-based baseline was built
on the Sejong treebank corpus (Kim, 2006) and the
Wikipedia-based baseline used Korean Wikipedia
articles 7. Table 2 compares the performances of the
two baseline systems and our method. Our proposed
projection-based approach obtained better perfor-
mance than the other systems. It outperformed the
heuristic-based system by 47.21 and the Wikipedia-
based system by 9.51 in the F-measure.
7 Conclusions
This paper presented a novel graph-based projection
approach for relation extraction. Our approach per-
formed a label propagation algorithm on a proposed
graph that represented the instance and context fea-
tures of both the source and target languages. The
feasibility of our approach was demonstrated by our
Korean relation extraction system. Experimental re-
sults show that our graph-based projection helped to
improve the performance of the cross-lingual anno-
tation projection of the semantic relations, and our
system outperforms the other systems, which incor-
porate monolingual external resources.
In this work, we operated the graph-based pro-
jection under very restricted conditions, because of
high complexity of the algorithm. For future work,
we plan to relieve the complexity problem for deal-
ing with more expanded graph structure to improve
the performance of our proposed approach.
