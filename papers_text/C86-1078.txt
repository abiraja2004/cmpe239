TEXAN is a sysLem of bransfer,.oriented text  analysis.  
I ts  l ingu is t i c  concept is based on a communicative 
appY'oacll wi th in the framework of speech act theory. 
In this view texts are considered to be the resu l t  of 
l ingu is t i c  actions? I t  is assumed that  they control  
the select ion of t rans la t ion  equivalents.  The trans- 
i t i on  of th is  concept of l ingu is t i c  actions ( text  
acts) to the model of computer analysis is performed 
by a context - f ree i l l ocut ion  grammar processing cate- 
gories of actions and a proposit ional  structure of 
states of a f fa i r s .  The grammar whicll is re lated to a 
text  lexicon provides the connection of these catego- 
r ies and the l ingu is t i c  surface units of a single 
language. 
I .  The Problem 
One of the main tasks of machine t rans la t ion ,  besides 
the resolut ion of ambiguities and the generation of 
appropriate structura l  analyses, is tlle select ion of 
adequate t rans la t ion  equivalents.  I t  has been Found 
that  an analysis which even produces unequivocal re- 
suits does not suf f ice for  the production of pragma- 
t i ca l l y  adequate texts in the target language. 
a d i f fe rent  text  type i t  may be r ight  or even must 
have th is  form. On the other hand, regulat ions (REGU- 
LATE) d i f fe r  in verb forms. Thus in German present 
tense is to be used, in English shal l - forms, and in 
French present and future may be a l te rnat ives .  A ge- 
neral p r inc ip le  is,  that  the part ic ipants  never are 
pronominalize(lo 
The question now is what kind of l ingu is t i c  model can 
hell) us to structure the re\].evanL components of the 
analysis system? 
2. Concept of Text Acts (TA) 
Our system needs a l ingu is t i c  model in which content, 
function and form of l ingus i t i c  expressions in a text  
are connected. We think that  a ~ood concept for  th is  
purpose may be the concept of text  acts (Rothkegel 
1984). TA are speech acts in which texts are produced. 
When we t rans la te ,  we are producing a new text .  
We fo l low Searle's analysis of speecll acts into i l l o -  
cut ionary,  proposi t ional  and locut ionary parts and 
assume, with respect to texts ,  the existence of three 
There are problems wiLh respect to the select ion of 
appropriate lexemes, co l locat ions ,  idiomatic expres- 
sions on the one hand. On the otl ler hand we have to 
know what kind of syntact ic  patterns and anaphorica\] 
or e l l ip t i ca l  constructions usual ly are applied with 
respect to t.he text  type. What we need is informaLion 
on cummunicative norms. In addit ion to a syrYtacLic 
and/or semantic analysis we have to provide a pragma- 
t i c  component especia l ly  in order to solve problems 
on the \]eve\] of transfer? 
The notion that  l ingu is t i c  usage and tlle select ion of 
rneans of expression ( \ ]ex is  and syntax) is directed by 
or at least influenced by -communicative intent -  
ions has received increasing at tent ion  witl l  respect 
to problems of t rans la t ion?  Recent research in th is  
area include communicative grammars for  foreign-\]an~ 
guage learning (e.g. Leech/Svartvik 1975), but also 
more speci f ic  Studies which exp l i c i ty  Lake account of 
text  function (ReiS/Vermeer 1984., ThJel 1980) and as- 
pects of action in texts (HOnig/KuSmaul 1982). These 
studies have influenced the theoret ica l  foundations 
of TEXAN to the extent tt lat we view communicative as- 
pects as decis ive for  the solut ion of t rans la t ion  
problems. 
Some stlort examples of our texts ( interact ing-regula~ 
Ling texts ,  especia l ly  in ternat iona l  t reat ies )may 
i l lus t ra te  th is  approach. We should know when a spe~ 
c ia i  pattern has to be applied in d i f fe rent  languages 
and when iL has to be changed. I t  has been found in 
these texts that there is a special type of de f in i -  
t ion (DEFINE) with lex ica l  res t r i c t ions  and which a l -  
ways is real ized by par t i c ip le  constructions in Eng- 
l i sh ,  German, French, I ta \ ] ien ,  etc. A t rans la t ion  by 
a re la t ive  clause, e.g. in German, would be wrong. In 
parts of text  acts ( I :  tex t  i l l ocut ion ;  T: tl lematic 
spec i f i cat ion  of Bile proposi t ional  part;  R: reper- 
to i res of lex ica l  and grammatical expressions which 
are typ ica l ly  used For a speci f ic  communicative task) .  
\]A : ( l ,  T, R ) 
Automatic procedures for tile processing of speech act 
bas ica l ly  have to do with the select ion and represen- 
ta t ion  of contextual factors? They determine the as- 
signment oF i l l ocut ions  to l ingu is t i c  utterances (Gaz- 
dar 1981). What models developed for  th is  purpose have 
in common is the use of overa l l  schemas whithin which 
the respective speech acts can be interpreted.  While 
Evans (1981)l landles general de f in i t ions  of s i tuat ion ,  
A l \ ]en/Perrau l t  (1980), Cohen (1978) and Grosz (1982) 
use general action plans in which the speech acts oF 
interest  are embedded. This p r inc ip le ,  which is appl- 
ied to dialogues in the models mentioned, we have 
applied to wr i t ten texts in TEXAN (example of an art.. 
ic le  in F ig . l ) .  
3. Model of Analysis 
l-he analysis of text  acts is or iented conceptual ly in 
a top-down fashion. In tile context of machine proces- 
sing, however, we have to re ly  on the l ingu is t i c  sur- 
face as input data. TEXAN is a system which bui lds on 
other programs already completed with in our pro ject .  
We use a syntax parser (SAIAN, cf.  SALEM 1980), for  
instance, which provides a descr ipt ion of const i tuent 
structure and valencies. Furthermore, we use a program 
for  ease-grammatical analysis (PROLID, cf.  Harbusch/ 
Rothkege\] 1984) which provides a ro le in terpreta t ion  
on the descr ipt ion of const i tuent  structure.  Input in- 
to TEXAN , then, is a complete st ructura l  and case- 
re la t iona l  descr ipt ion of sentences. This determines

to a large extent the strategy of analysis within 
TEXAN. In pr ic ip le ,  the task here is to bundle the 
available information on syntax, lexis and thematic 
roles in a form suitable to the determination of the 
underlying i l l ocut ion .  Nevertheless, the concept of 
text acts is the basis for  the structure of data. We 
dist inguish the fol lowing components (Fig. 2):

The components of the automatic analysis are GRILL 
(grammar of i l l ocut ions) ,  TEL (text lexicon) and TEF 
(sequence of propositions of the text ) .  INT (schema 
of interpretat ion for the structure of states of af- 
fa i rs  and communicative tasks) and HAS (action struc- 
ture of the text)  are preconditions in order to for-  
mulate the rules of GRILL. ' text '  represents the in- 
put structure. This means that the sentences are syn- 
tac t i ca l ly  analyzedand ordered according to a propo- 
s i t ional  l i s t ing .  ' text  representation' is output in 
the form of Fig. I .  
In the fol lowing we w i l l  sketch the structure of the 
components. 
INT represents the structure in which knowledge of 
states of af fa i rs  is embedded into knowledge of l ing- 
u i s t i c  action. I t  consists of 4 parts which can be 
combined. States of af fa i rs  (see Fig. 3): 
(a) actions (a (x, (y), ( z ) ) )  
states of af fa i rs  occur as act ions/ interact ions

(b) states of af fa i rs  occur as events concerning 
abstract objects: b (z) 
(c) s i tuat ion (m,n,o,p . . . .  ) 
actions are embedded in a s i tuat ion described by pa- 
rameters of time, location, personal relat ionship,  
domain, procedures, etc.

(d) the verbal ization of an action can be seen in the 
status of condition, norm, purpose, permission,etc. 
Linguist ic actions: 
They are interpretations of states of af fa i rs  with re- 
spect to communicative Basks and can be described as 
predications on propositions. Thus we can add several 
types of i l locut ions to (a)-(d). Examples are: 
CONCRETIZE (a (x, (y), ( z ) ) )  
FIX (condition (b ( z ) ) )  
HAS (Fig. 4) represents the action structure of 'trea~ 
t ies of trade' in terms of text acts. Our example in 
Fig.1 shows a segment of REGULATE (case).

TEL represents the text lexicon. According to the two 
tasks of TEXAN TEl_ includes hwo sections of informa- 
tion: an idenhif icat ion section concerning the text 
act structure (TAS) which is described by types of i l -  
locution and roles such as REGULATE (case) ,  SPECIFY 
(object), etc.,  and a selection section consisting of 
l i s ts  of repertoires which belong to several single 
languages (TAE:R(LI . . . . .  Ln). As a third par\[ a key (K) 
is established which provides the connection of input 
data and the TA-information. On the level of simple 
i l locut ions the key represented by the lemma of the 
head of the respective phrase; on the level of complex 
i l locut ions the key is the i l locuhion of a lower level. 
An entry of IEL has the fol lowing design: 
TELl: I. key (lemma or i l locut ionc)  
2. TAS (I/T) 
3. TAE (R (LI: \],g) 
R (L2: l ,g)  
R.(LAI l ,g)) 
I t  is possible that one key corresponds to several en- 
tries of TEL. This is the case i f  there are different 
TAS. 
GRILL provides rules which represent the structure of 
INT and HAS and which transform them into procedures. 
GRILL (grammar' of i l \ ]ocut ions) has such a form that i t  
can be processed by a context-free grammar parser. A 
parser has been developed according to the structure 
of the programming language COMSKEE. Elements of the 
TEF-component ( l i s t ing  of propositions of the text) 
are integrated as parameter (F) into the rules. 
a) rule (RIO) for terminals (lexicon rule): 
I e (T i ) / (F ' )  := lemma z, (T i) / (F ' )  
e.g. CONCRETIZE (contact)/(F1) := "inform" (cont)/(F1) 
b) rule for non-terminals (RI-R9), general form: 
Ic(Tj ) / (F i_  m) := 
I I (T f ) / (F  i) + < I Ig(Th), R In/ (Fo_ p) >

4. Transfer 
Orl the basis oF ident i f ied i \ ] \ ]ocutions with respect to 
L1 we have access to tile Iexical  and grammatical in- 
Formation of R with regard to L2, L3, etc. This infor-  
mation is offered by TEL. We apply a further assign- 
ment rule of the fol lowing type (e=engtish, d=german, 
l=\]exical in f . ,  g=syntactic in f . ) :  
for 'lemma'(Lx), ) := R(I~, gk ) (Ly)

Examples: 
for 'subject ' (e) ,  CONCRETIZE(commerce) := 
R(l : 'einf i Jhren',  'anwenden' 
g: f in i te  verb)(d) 
for GENERALIZE (case) (e):=
