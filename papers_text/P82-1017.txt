REFLECTIONS ON 20 YEARS OF THE ACL 
AN INTRODUCTION

Our society was founded on 13 June 1962 as 
the Association for Machine Translation and 
Computational Linguistics. Consequently, this 
1982 Annual Meeting represents our 20th 
anniversary. We did, Of course, change our name 
to the Association for Computational Linguistics 
in 1968, but that did not affect the continuity of 
the organization. The date of this panel, 17 
June, misses the real anniversary by four days, 
but no matter; the occasion still allows us to 
reflect on where we have been and where we are 
going. I seem to be sensitive to opportunities 
for celebrations. In looking through my AMTCL/ACL 
correspondence over the years, I came across a 
copy of a memo sent to Bob Simmons and Hood 
Roberts during our lOth anniversary year, 
recommending that something in commemoration might 
be appropriate. I cannot identify anything in the 
program of that meeting or in my notes about it 
that suggests they took me seriously then, but 
that reflects the critical difference between 
volunteering a recommendation and Just plain 
volunteerlngl 
My invitation to participate in this panel 
was sent out to the presidents of the Association, 
who were, in order, Vic Yngve, Dave Hays, Win 
Lehmann, Paul Garvin, Susumo Kuno, (I fit here in 
the sequence), Martin Kay, Warren Plath, Joyce 
Friedman, Bob Simmons, Bob Barnes, Bill Woods, 
Aravind Joshi, Stan Petrick, Paul Chapin, Jon 
Allen, RonKaplan,  Bonnie Webber, Norm Sondheimer, 
and Jane Robinson, and to my predecessor as 
Secretary-Treasurer, Hood Roberts. Harry 
Josselson, our first Secretary-Treasurer, is no 
longer among us, but he would have enjoyed such a 
gathering, being one for ceremony and celebration. 
Vic, Dave, Martin, Warren, Joyce, Bob 
Simmons, Bill, Aravind, Stan, Paul, Jon, Ron, 
Bonnie, and Norm agreed to Join me on the panel. 
Jane refused on the grounds that she was not yet 
part of history and that her Presidential Address 
provided ample platform to convey her reflections. 
Win, Paul, Susumo, and Bob Barnes were not able to 
come, and Hood was still waffling when this piece 
was being written. Vic, Dave, Win, Bob Simmons, 
Aravind, Paul, Jon, Norm, and I have written down 
some of our reflections; they appear on the 
following pages. 
My charge to the panelists, with respect to 
both oral and written tradition, was quite broad: 
"You are asked to reflect on significant 
experiences during your tenure of that office, in 
particular as they reflect on the state of 
computational linguistics then and now, and 
perhaps with some suggestions for what the future 
will bring." The written responses are varied, as 
you can see; I am sure that the oral responses 
will prove to be equally so. 
To provide some perspective--and record some 
history, I am attaching a synopsis of "officers, 
editors, committees, meetings, and program 
chairing" (please let me know about errors!). It 
is interesting to note the names of people--many 
of whom are still prominent in the field, the 
practices associated with our annual meetings, and 
our publication history. I will comment on the 
latter two. 
Our first meeting was held in conjunction 
with the 1963 ACM National Conference, but it is 
clear that our primary allegiance has been with 
the Linguistic Society of America, since we met 
seven times in conjunction with its summer 
meetings. For a period, we alternated between the 
LSA and the Spring Joint Computer Conference--and 
actually included that schedule in our membership 
flyer. We Joined with the American Society for 
Information Science twice, and the Cognitive 
Science Society once. The convocation of the 
first International Conference on Computational 
Linguistics, now known popularly as COLING, 
replaced our annual meeting in 1965, and we are 
scheduled to host COLING-84 in two years. 
Recently, we have been meeting independently, 
reflecting an increased confidence in our ability 
to "make it on our own!" 
The publication history of the Association 
has been equally varied. The Finite String, our 
newsletter, was published as a separate under the 
editorship of Hood Roberts from 1964 through 1973, 
and has continued in various forms ever since. In 
1965, the Association adopted MT: Mechanical 
Translation, a Journal founded by Vic Yngve in 
1954, changing its name to Mechanical Translation 
and Computational Linguistics in the process. 
However, that Journal was not able to sustain a 
sufficient flow of manuscripts, and the last 
issue, dated 1968, was published in 1970. After a 
lengthy exploration of an alternative primary 
Journal, Dave Hays brought the American Journal of 
Computational Linguistics into being in 1974. Hi-as 
intention had been to create a printed Journal 
that contained extended abstracts, supplemented by 
microfiches that provided details, programs, and 
computer listings. This proposal was submitted to 
the National Science Foundation for support. A 
grant was approved, but it stipulated that we 
publish a microfiche-only Journal, and we did that 
until 1978, The Finite String being issued as a 
separate microfiche during this period. It became 
increasingly clear during the five microfiche 
years that the micropublishing industry was not 
going to develop as predicted in the early 1970s. 
89 
Microfiche readers that were both inexpensive and 
convenient had not materialized, and our members 
were reluctant to commit their manuscripts to a 
medium that restricted readership to a dedicated 
few. Consequently, George Heldorn set about 
converting the AJCL to a printed Journal, the 
first issue of which appeared in 1980. Respectful 
of its microformal origins, it is distributed with 
a microfiche that duplicates the printed version 
but sometimes contains additional material. The 
Finite Strin~ Newsletter continues to provide 
general information of interest to the membership 
as a special section. 
To complete our publlcatlon history, I can 
announce a new venture that the Association is 
Just beginning, Studies in Natural Language 
Processln~, a monograph series under the 
Editorship of Aravlnd Joshl. It was prompted by 
Norm Sondheimer and brought into being through the 
organizatlonal efforts of Paul Chapln. We are 
Just completing negotiations with Cambridge 
University Press, which will publish it for us. 
So much for general history, I will reserve 
my proper place down the llne for other kinds of 
commentary.
