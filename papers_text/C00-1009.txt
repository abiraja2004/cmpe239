This t)al)t;r de, scribes a hybrid prol)osal to 
combine n-grams and Stochastic Context-Free 
Grammars (SCFGs) tbr language modeling. A 
classical n-gram model is used to cat)lure the 
local relations between words, while a stochas- 
tic grammatical inodel is considered to repre- 
sent the hmg-term relations between syntactical 
stru(:tm'es. In order to define this granmlatical 
model, which will 1)e used on large-vo(:almlary 
comph'~x tasks, a eategory-t)ased SCFG and a 
prol)abilisti(" model of' word (tistrilmtion in the 
categories have been 1)rol)osed. Methods for 
leanfing these stochastic models tTor complex 
tasks are described, and algorithms for con> 
puting the word transition probal)ilities are also 
1)resented. Filmily, ext)erilnents using the Penn 
Treel)ank corpus improved by 30% the test; set; 
l)erph~xity with regard to the classical n-gram 
models. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Language modeling is an important asl)e('t to 
consider in large-vocabulary Sl)eeeh recognition 
systenls (Bahl et al, 1983; ,lelinek, 1998). The 
n--grain models are the most widely-used for a 
wide range of domains (Bahl et al, 1983). The 
n-grams are simple and robust models and ad- 
equately capture the local restrictions between 
words. Moreover, it is well-known how to es- 
timate the parameters of the lnodet and how 
to integrate them in a speech recognition sys- 
tem. However, the n-grmn models cannot ad- 
equately characterize the long-term constraints 
of the sentences of the tasks. 
On the other hand, Stochastic Context-Free 
Grammars (SCI)'Gs) allow us a better model-

CICYT under contract (TIC98/0423-C(16). 
ing of long-term relations and work well on 
lhnited-domain tasks of low perplexity. How- 
ever, SCFGs work poorly for large-vocabulary, 
general-purpose tasks because learning SCFGs 
and the (:Olnlmtation of word transition 1)roba - 
bilities present serious 1)roblenls tLr ('olnplex real 
tasks. 
In the literature, a nulnber of works have pro- 
posed ways to generalize the n-gram models (.le- 
linek, 1998; Siu and Ostendorf, 2000) or com- 
1)ining with other structural models (Bellegarda, 
1998; Gilet and Ward, 1998; Chellm and Jelinek, 
1998). 
In this iml)er, we present a confl)ined lan- 
guage model defined as a linear combination of 
n-grams, whk'h are llse(t to capture the local re- 
lations between words, and a stoehasti(: gram- 
matieal model whi(:h is used to represent he 
glottal relation 1)etw(x'dl synl:aetie strll(;tllrt~s, hi 
or(ter to (:at)turc, these lollg-terltl relations an(t to 
solve the main 1)rolflems derived Dora the large- 
vocabulary complex tasks, we 1)l'Ol)ose here to 
detine: a eategory--ba,~ed SCFG and a prolmbilis- 
tic model of word distrilmt;ion in the categories. 
Taking into a(:count his proposal, we also de- 
scribe here how to solve the learning of these 
stochastic models and their integrati(m prol> 
1CIlIS. 
With regard to the learning problem, several 
algorithms that learn SCFGs by means of es- 
timation algorithms have been 1)reposed (Lari 
and Young, 1990; Pereira and Schal)es, 1992; 
Sfinehez and Benedi, 1998), and pronfising re- 
suits have been achieved with category-based 
SCFGs on real tasks (Sfi.nchez and Benedi, 
\]999). 
In relation to the integration problem, we 
l)resent wo algorithms that compute the word 
transition 1)robability: the first algorithm is 
based on the l~efl;-to-ll,ight Inside algorithln 
55 
(LRI) (Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991), and the sec- 
ond is based on an application of a Viterbi 
scheme to the LRI algorithm (the VLRI algo- 
rithm) (S~nehez and Benedf, 1997). 
Finally, in order to evaluate the behavior of 
this proposal, experiments with a part of the 
Wall Street Journal processed in the Penn Tree- 
bank project were carried out and significant im- 
provements with regard to the classical n-gram 
models were achieved. 
2 The  language mode l  
An important problem related to language mod- 
eling is the evaluation of Pr(wk I w l . . .  wk-1). 
In order to compute this probability, we pro- 
pose a hybrid language model defined as a sire- 
ple linear combination of n-gram models and a 
stochastic grammatical model G~: 
Pr(wklwl . . .w~_l)  = c~Pr(~klwk-n.. .wt~-l)  
+(1 - c~) P"(wklw~... wk-,, G~), (1) 
where 0 < c~ < 1 is a weight factor which de- 
pends on the task. 
The expression Pr(w/~lwk_n...wk-,) is the 
word probability of occurrence of w/~ given by 
the n-gram model. The parameters of this 
model can be easily estinmted, and the ex- 
pression Pr(wl~lWl~_n...  wtc-1) can be efficiently 
computed (Bahl et al, 1983; Jelinek, 1998). 
In order to define the stochastic gram- 
matical model G~ of the expression 
Pr(wk\]w~ . . . wk_ j ,  G~) for large-vocabulary 
complex tasks, we propose a combination of 
two different stochastic models: a category- 
based SCFG (G~), that allows us to represent 
the long-term relations between these syntacti- 
cal structures and a probabilistic model of word 
distribution into categories (Cw). 
This proposal introduces two imlmrtant as- 
peels, which are the estimation of the parame- 
ters of the stochastic models, Gc and Cw, and 
the computation of the following expression: 
Pr(~klWl... Wk-1, ac, Cw) 
= Pr(wl . . .  wk.. .  la~, c~) (2) 
IC , C,,,) 
3 Training of the models 
The parameters of the described model are es- 
timated fi'om a training sample, that is, from 
a set of sentences. Each word of the sentence 
has a part-of  speech tag (POStag) associated 
to it. These POStags are considered as word 
categories and are the terminal symbols of the 
SCFG. h 'om this training sample, the parame- 
ters of G~ and C~ can be estimated as tbllows. 
First, tile parameters of Cw, represented by 
Pr(w\[c), are computed as: 
= 
E,o,  (3) 
where N(w,c) is the number of times that the 
word w has been labeled with the POStagc.  It 
is important o note that a word w can belong to 
different categories. In addition, it may hapt)en 
that a word in a test set does not appear in 
the training set, and therefore some smoothing 
technique has to be carried out. 
With regard to the estimation of the category- 
based SCFGs, one of the most widely-known 
methods is the Inside-Outside (IO) algo- 
rithln (Lari and Young, 1990). The application 
of this algorithm presents important problems 
which are accentuated in real tasks: the time 
complexity per iteration and the large number 
of iterations that are necessary to converge. An 
alternative to the IO algorithm is a.n algorithm 
based on the Viterbi score (VS algorithm) (Ney, 
1992). The convergence of the VS algorithm 
is faster than the IO algorithm. However, the 
SCFGs obtained are, in genera.l, not as well 
learned (Simchez et al, 1996). 
Another possibility for estimating SCFCs, 
which is somewhere between the IO and VS al- 
gorithms, has recently been proposed. This ap- 
proach considers only a certain subset of deriva- 
tions in the estimation process. In order to 
select this subset of derivations, two alterna- 
tives have been considered: froln structural in- 
formation content in a bracketed corpus (Pereira 
and Schabes, 1992; Amaya et al, 1999), and 
from statistical information content in the k- 
best derivations (Sgmchez and Benedl, 1998). 
In the first alternative, the IOb and VSb algo- 
rithms which learn SCFGs from partially brack- 
eted corpora were defined (Pereira and Schabes, 
1992; Amaya et al, 1999). In the second alter- 
native, the kVS algorithm for the estimation of 
the probability distributions of a SCFG fl'om the 
k-best derivations was proposed (Shnchez and 
Benedi, 1998). 
56 
All of these algorithms have a tilne (:omi)lexity 
O('n,a\[PI), where 'n is the length of the input 
st;ring, and \[1)1 is the size. of the SCFG. 
These algorithms have been tested in 
real tasks fl)r estimating cat(,gory-1)ased 
SCFOs (Sfinchez and Benedf, 1999) and the 
results obtained justify their applicatiol, in 
complex real tasks. 
4 In tegrat ion  o f  the  mode l  
l?rom exl)ression (2), it can bee se(m that in or- 
der to integrate the too(M, it is necessary to 
efli(:iently ('oml)ute the expression: 
P~0,,~... ',,,k... la,.., <,,). (4) 
In order to describo how this computation (:an 
l)e m~de, we tirst introduce some notation. 
A Court:el-Free, Grammar G is a four-tul)le 
(N, E, P, S), wher(; N is the tinit(; set of nont(;r- 
minals, )2 is the tinite sol; of terminals (N ~-/E =

1' is the finite set of t)rodu(:tions or ruh;s of the 
tbrm A -+ it, where A c N a.nd c~ C (N U E) +

Now, we pr(:sent two algorithms ill order to 
compute the word transition 1)rol)at)ility. The 
first algorithm is based on the Ll/i algorithm, 
a.nd the second is based on an apt)li('atiou of a 
Viterbi s(:heme to the LRI algorithln (the VLI/\] 
a.lgorithm). 
P robab i l i ty  of  generat ing  an init ial  
subst r ing  
The COmlmtation of (4) is l)as('.d on an algo- 
rithm which is a modith:ation of the I,RI algo- 
rithm (aelinek and Lafl'erty, 1991). This new 
algorithln is based on the detlnition of Pr(A << 
i , j ) )  = Pr(A ~ wi . . .w j  . . .  Ic . .  c,,,) as th(, 
1)robability that A generates the initial sul)string 
wi . . .  w j . . .  given Gc and C.,,,. This can l)e com- 
puted with the following (lynamic 1)rogrmmning 
s(:henl(;: 
c 
+ ~ Q(A ~ D)p(D ~ ~)P"(~"~l~)), 
D

Pr (d<<i , j )=  E ~ Q(A ~ BC)

pl.(J~ < ~:, 1 >) p,.(c << 1 + 1, j ) .  
::: this way, Pr (~,~. . .~,k . . . IG, : ,6 ' , , , )  = 
Pr(S << l,k).  
In this cxi)ression, Q(A ~ D) is the proba- 
bility that D is the leftmost nol:terminal in all 
sentential fOHllS which are derived from A. The 
vahu; Q(A ~ BC)  is the probability that BC 
is th(; initial substring of all sentential forms de- 
riv(;d from i\. Pr(H < i, l  >) is th{; probability 
that the substring "wi... wz is generated from/~ 
given G,: and C.,,,. Its contlmt;ation will be de- 
fined \]ater. 
It shouh:l be noted that th(; combination of 
the models G,. and C~,, in carried out in the vah:e 
P'r(A << i, i). This is the lnain difl:'crcnce with 
resp(wt the \]A/I algorithm. 
P robab i l i ty  of  the  best  der ivat ion  
generat ing  an init ial  subst r ing  
An algorithm whi(:\]l is similar to the previous 
(>he (-m~ l)e (l(~fin(~d t)ased on the \;iterl)i ,~(:lmme. 
In this way, it is l)onsil)le to obtain the \])cst; pars- 
ing of an initial sul)string. This new algorithm is 
also related to the \/'Lll.I algol'ithni (Shn(:hez and 
B('aw, di, 1997) and is 1)ased on the (lciinition of 
P,~'(A << ',:, J)) = P,~'(A ~ ",,i . . . ',,j . . . IG~:, Cw) 
as the probability of the most probal)le 1)arsing 
which generates wi . . .w j . . ,  from A given G,: 
and C,,. This can 1)(i (:omputcd as follows: 
p:(A << i , , : )=  m:?x(p(A ~ c)l),(~,,~l,.'), 
m~Lx(Q(A => D)'p(D ~ c)Pr('wi\[c))), 
D

A A 
Thorcfo,o >4",~...'wk... \[a,:, <,,)  -- p , . (s  << 
1,k). 
In this expression, Q(A ~ D) is the t)rob - 
al)ility that D is the leftmost nontermina, l in 
57 
the most t)robable sentential form which is de- 
rived ti'om d. The value Q(A ~ BC) is the 
probability that BC is the initial substring of 
most the probable sentential form derived from 
A. Pr(B < i, 1 >) is the probability of the most 
probable parse which generates wi ? ? ? wl froli1 B. 
P robab i l i ty  of generating a string 
The wflue Pr(A < i , j  >) = Pr(A d> 
wi...'u;jlG~,Go) is defined as the probability 
that the substring wi... wj is generated from 
A given G~ and C,~. To calculate this proba- 
bility a modification of the well-known Inside 
algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990) is proposed. 
This computation is carried out by using the 
following dynamic progralmning scheme: 
Pr(A < i,i >) -- ~p(A-~ c) Pr(wilc) , 
c 
j - - I  
Pr (A<i , j>)  : E E p(A -+ BC) 
B,CcN l=i 
pr(B < i,l >)Pr (C < 1 + 1,j >). 
In this way, Pr(w~ ...whiGs, C,,) = Pr(S < 
1,n >). 
As we have commented above, the combina- 
tion of the two parts of the grammatical model 
is carried out in the value Pr(A < i, i >). 
Probabi l i ty of the best derivation 
generating a string 
The t)rol)abitity of the best derivation that 
genel'~-gtes a s t r ing ,  P r ( 'u ,1 . . .  ~t/2,~l~c, 6 'w)  , can  
be evaluated using a Viterbi-like scheme (Ney, 
1992). As in the previous case, the computation 
of this probability is based on the definition of 
p .(A < g,j >) = pU-(A <,,) as 
the probability of the best derivation that gen- 
erates the substring wi... wj fi'om A given Gc 
and Cw. Similarly: 
P r (A<i , i>)  = 
Pr(A < i , j  >) =

Finally, the time complexity of these algo- 
rithms is the same as the algorithms they are 
related to, there%re the time colnplexity is 
O(k:alrl), where tc is the length of the input 
string and IPI is the size of the SCFG. 
5 Exper iments  w i th  the  Penn 
Treebank  Corpus  
The corpus used in the experiments was the part 
of the Wall Street Journal which had been pro- 
cessed in the Petal %'eebank project 1 (Marcus el: 
al., 1993). This corpus consists of English texts 
collected from the Wall Street Journal from edi- 
tions of the late eighties. It contains approx- 
imately one million words. This corpus was 
automatically labelled, analyzed and manually 
checked as described in (Marcus et 31., 1993). 
There are two kinds of labelling: a POStag la- 
belling and a syntactic labelling. The size of 
the vocalmlary is greater than 25,000 diil'erent 
words, the POStag vocabulary is composed of 
45 labels 2 and the syntactic vocabulary is com- 
posed of 14 labels. 
The corpus was divided into sentences accord- 
ing to the bracketing. In this way, we obtained 
a corpus whose main characteristics are shown 
in Table 1.

We took advantage of the category-based 
SCFGs estimated in a previous work (Simchez 
and Benedf, 1998). These SCFGs were esti- 
mated with sentences which had less than 15 
words. Therefore, in this work, we assumed such 
restriction. The vocabulary size of the new cor- 
pus was 6,333 different words. For the exper- 
iments, the corpus was divided into a training 
corpus (directories 00 to 1.9) and a test corpus 
(directories 20 to 24). The characteristics of 
these sets can be seen in Table 2. The part of the 
1Release 2 of this data set can be ob- 
tained t'rmn the Linguistic Data Consor- 
tium with Catalogue number LDC94T4B

grammatical model which is used to represent 
the global relation between syntactic structures. 
The stochastic graminatical model is composed 
of a category-based SCFG and a probabilistic 
model of word distribution in the categories. 
Several algorithms have been described to esti- 
mate the parameters of the model flom a the 
smnple. In addition, efficient algorithms tbr 
solving the problem of the interpretation with 
this model have been presented. 
The proposed model has been tested on the 
part of Wall Street .Journal processed in the 
Penn Treebank project, and the results obtained 
improved by more tlmn 30% the test set; per- 
plexity over results obtained by a simple 3-grain 
model.
