1, In t roduct ion  
At  the  Cent re  fo r  Computat iona l  
L inguist ics,  we are des ign ing and imp lement ing  
an Eng l i sh - to - Japanese  in teract ive  mach ine  
t rans la t ion  sys tem.  Tile p ro jec t  is  funded 
jo in t ly  by  the  Alvey  D i rec torate  and  
In ternat iona l  Computers  L imi ted  ( ICL) .  'Pile 
p ro to type  sys tem runs  on the  ICL PERQ, though 
much of the deve lopment  work has been done on a 
VAX \]\]./750. It is imp lemented  in Prolog, in the 
interests  of rap id  protohyping,  but intended for 
opt imizat ion.  The in forming pr inc ip les  are those 
of modern  complex- feature -based  l ingu is t i c  
theor ies ,  in  par t i cu la r  Lex ica l - -Funct iona l  
Grammar  (Bresnan (ed.) 1982, Kap lan  and Bresnan 
1982), and Genera \ ] i zed  Phrase St ructure  Grammar 
(Gazdar  et  al. 1985). 
For  deve lopntent  purposes  we are us ing  an 
ex is t ing  corpus  o f  10 ,000  words  o f  cont inuous  
prose from tile PERQ's graphics  documentat ion;  in 
the long  term, the  sys tem wi l l  be extended for  
use  by techn ica l  wr i te rs  in f ie lds  o ther  than  
software. At the t ime of writ ing, we have  we l l -  
deve loped sys tem deve lopment  so f tware ,  user  
interface, and grammar and d ic t ionary  hand l ing  
ut i l i t ies .  Tile Eng l i sh  ana lys i s  grammar  hand\ ]es  
most  of the syntact ic  s t ructures  of the corpus, 
and we have  a range  of  fo rmats  for  output  of 
l ingu is t i c  representat ions  and Japanese text. A 
t rans fer  g:camnlar for Eng l i sh - Japanese  has been 
prototyped, but is not *lot yet  fu l l y  adequate to 
hand le  a l l  const ruct ions  in the  corpus ;  a 
fac i l i ty  fo r  d ic t ionary  ent ry  in kan J i  is 
incorporated .  The aspect  of  the  sys tem we w i l l  
focus on in the present  paper  is its in teract ive  
nature, di,qcussing the range of d i f ferent  types 
of in teract ion  wh ich  a're prov ided  or  permi t ted  
for d i f fe rent  types of user. 
2. %'he re la t ionsh ip  between buman and machine 
The complex i ty  of the t rans la t ion  task, and 
the dlver.~:kty of the knowledge types invo lved ,  
makes  the  imp lementat ion  of all MT  sys tem a 
research  prob lem in knowledge eng ineer ing .  In 
o rder  fo r  in termed ia te  resu l t s  to  be of  
p ract l ca l  va lue ,  it  is necessary  to in tegrate  
human exper t i se  in to  the  mach ine  t rans la t ion  
process .  A f te r  th i s  input ,  the  mach ine 's  
knowledge must  be complete ,  adequate  fo r  
car ry ing  out a l l  later  stages in the t rans la t ion  
chain. Three s t ra teg ies  are recogn ized  for this 
invo lvement ,  pos t -ed i t lng ,  p re -ed i t  ing, and 
in teract ive  t rans la t ion  (see further Whi te lock  
(ed.) 1985). 
Of  these  three  s t ra teg ies ,  pos t -ed i ted  
t rans la t ion  is obv ious ly  the safest; the human 
has  the  f ina l  say,  and  so  can  cor rect  any  
t rans la t ion  e, rrors made by tile machine. However,  
? tile post -ed~tor  must  be exper t  in the  source  
language (at leas t  for  the  text - type) ,  ta rget  
language,  and  sub jec t  inatter, i.e. a competent  
t rans la tor  in h i s /her  own right. The major i ty  of 
current  mach ine  t rans la t ion  systems are of this 
type - it has proved  to be cost e f fec t ive  - but 
post -ed i t ing  is both  revet i t i ve  and to ta l ly  
ind ispensable .  Current  in teract ive  systems, too, 
typ ica l ly  requ i re  a h igh  degree  of  b i l ingua l  
competence on the humen's part. 
The pre -ed i t ing  opt ion  assumes input wh ich  
has  been  e i ther  d ra f ted  or  ed i ted  to use  on ly  a 
res t r i c ted  sub<language.  Desp i te  i t s  
demonst ra ted  ut i l i ty  (e.g. Meteo  (Cheva l ie r  et 
al. 1978), Xerox  Syst ran  (Ruf f ino  1982)), it is 
o f ten  v iewed as a poor  a l te rnat ive ,  convey ing  
connotat ions  of severe  res t r i c t ions  on input. We 
be l ieve  that  the not ion  of p re -ed i t ing  shou ld  be 
reexamined in  the  l ight  of  Kay's  remark  that  
mach ine  t rans la t ion  :is in p r inc ip le  poss ib le  
on ly  between fo rmal  languages  (fn 1). Any  MT 
sys tem wi l l  p roduce  in te l l ig ib le  output  f rom 
on ly  a proper  subset  of  texts  in what  is c la imed 
? to be the  source  language.  T rans la t ion  of a 
natura l  language in its ent i re ty  is an i l l usory  
goa l .  I f  the  par t i cu la r  subset  wh ich  can  be 
automat ica l ly  t rans la ted  is not  fo rmal i sed  
independent l  V of its ins tant ia t ion  as a computer  
system, the ent i re  output  must  be checked after  
t rans la t ion ,  in con junct ion  w i th  the  source  
text. We be l ieve  that it is p re ferab le  to def ine 
exp l i c i t l y  the  subset  of  the  source  language 
tbat  the  mach ine  can  t rans la te .  Moreover ,  we 
be l ieve  that  the  dra f t ing  of  texts  in such  a 
res t r i c ted  language is an idea l  cand idate  for  
automation.  
We have  there fore  des igned a sys tem to 
ef fect  mono l ingua l  in teract ive  pre -ed i t ing  for 
p re -ed i ted  t rans la t ion ,  quest ion ing  the human 
user  about  the  source  text ,  not  about  i t s  
t rans la t ion  (cf. J ohnson  & Whi te lock  1985). An 
in teract ive  sys tem of th i s  type  shou ld  be ab le  
to accept  an adequate  subset  of g rammat ica l ly  
we l l - fo rmed input, query ing  the user  to reso lve  
ambigu i t ies  o r  indeterminac ies  unt i  1 a 
representat ion  is reached which is su f f i c ient ly  
deta i led  and  prec ise  to  guarantee  acceptab le  
t rans la t ion  to  a g iven  language ( fn  2). A 
i, ono l ingua l  wr i te r  can  thus  produce  f in i shed  
ta rget  language text  w ihout  fu r ther  human 
intervent ion.  As an inc identa l  benefit,  s/he can 
be expected  to learn  f rom exper ience  wh ich  
sentence pat terns  w i l l  not be accepted and which 
w i l l  g ive  many ambigu i t ies ,  and avo id  them. 
Indeed it  cou ld  be argued that  such  a sys tem is 
va luab le  even  mono l ingua l ly ,  as an ' intel l igent'  
s ty le  checker, w i th  t rans la t ion  capab i l i ty  as an 
inc identa l  benefit.

Thus we do not  concur  w i th  S locum's  (\].985) 
assessment  of the potent ia l  of interact ion.  
S locum character i zes  in teract ive  mach ine  
t rans la t ion  as "Human Ass i s ted  Mach ine  
Translation" as distinct from 'full' MT, on the 
grounds that the exploitat ion of the bi l ingual  
expertise of a human is inter leaved with that of 
the machine.  It appears  that the mach ine  is not 
car ry ing  out  the  task  of  t rans la t ion  
automatically. 
However ,  it seems more  appropr ia te  to 
cons ider  the complete  cha in  of p rocesses  from 
source  language text  compos i t ion  to target  
language text completion. From this perspective, 
any  type  of  mach ine  t rans la t ion  is human 
assisted. It is important to assess the quantity 
and character  of huma~ in tervent ion  as we l l  as 
its posit ion in the system. A post-edlted system 
res igns  i t se l f  f rom the start  to inadequacy,  
bu i ld ing  in the requ i rement  for (more or less) 
radical human revis ion of its output, so that it 
might  bet ter  be ca l led  pro - t rans la t ion  than 
t rans la t ion  proper;  wh i le  many cur rent  pro- 
ed i t ing  sys tems,  a l though o f fe r ing  fu l l y  
automat ic  p roduct ion  of target  language text 
f rom source language text, requ i re  a human 
contribution in the pre-input stage, control l ing 
and res t r i c t ing  that  source  text,  wh ich  
qua l i ta t ive ly  far exceeds the demands of on- l ine 
interaction (fn 3). 
Moreover ,  the  fu ture  o f  mach ine  
translation, and natural language processing in 
general, seems certain to lie with systems based 
on A* techn iques  such as the use of in fe rence  
fo r  ambigu i ty  reso lu t ion .  A pr imary  
consideration wil l  be to faci l itate the transfer 
of exper t i se  from human to machine,  by means of 
modu lar  p rogramming,  knowledge eng ineer ing  
techniques, and, ultimately, machine learning. 
In teract ive  sys tem des ign may we l l  be the type 
most  read i ly  extended to incorporate  such  
techn iques  as they are deve loped;  the forms of 
in teract ion  imp lemented  for the present  human 
user can be progress ively  delegated to a virtual  
or mach ine  "user". Thus desp i te  the admi t ted  
l imitations of interactive translat ion per se, 
systems including some sort of interaction offer 
bQth the most eff icient use of current resources 
and the most  conv inc ing  bas is  and mode l  for 
research aimed at great ly  improving translat ion 
quality. 
3. System development tools 
Wi th  the  a im of p roduc ing  a too l  for  
cont inu ing  research  as we l l  as a sys tem of 
p ract i ca l  u t i l i ty ,  we have  conce ived  our  
t rans la t ion  sys tem i t se l f  and  the sys tem 
deve lopment  too ls  as an in tegrated  entity. 
Recogn is ing  a var ie ty  of types of 'user', from 
end-user  to sys tem designer,  our  deve lopment  
sys tem is o rgan ized  as a tree of fac i l i t ies ,  
where  d i f fe rent  types of user  are a l lowed or 
offered access at different levels. Faci l i t ies 
supported include: 
i) us ing  the system for writ ing,  ed i t ing  
and translating, 
2) writ ing the grammars, 
3) deve lop ing  the grammat ica l  theory  and 
the translat ion chain, 
4) designing the system itself. 
A l l  tasks are carried out by traversing the tree 
under  the gu idance  of menus. The menu system is 
des igned to a l low non-programmers  (fn 4) to 
specify both the conversion of l inguistic data 
to menus ,  and  the  in terpretat ion  of  menu 
cho ices .  Th is  p rov ides  the organ isat ion  
necessary to control : 
a) d i f fe rent  v iews  of the data  by 
different users, and 
330 
b) different processing/compilat ion of 
data according to its type. 
Cor respond ing  to the four types of task 
given above, we recognise four (idealised) types 
of user: 
1 the end user, 
2 theh igh- leve l  l ingu is t  (g rammar  
writer), 
3 the low- leve l  \ ] ingu is t  (g rammar  
designer), 
4) the system designer~ 
They have access rights as follows: 
i) The  end user  w i l l  be a mono l ingua l  
(Eng l i sh )  techn ica l  wr i te r ,  w i th  exper t  
knowledge of the  techn ica l  f ie ld  and i ts  
termino logy,  but no knowledge of the target  
language. (For deve lopment  purposes  we are 
work ing  w i th  extant  texts  chose*\] to be typ ica l  
of the i r  kind; but  the in tent ion  is to prov ide  
the wr i te r  w i th  a too l  for  the  in i t ia l  
compos i t ion  of such texts. The end user  w i l l  
thus be ab le  to respond .lore f lex ib ly  to the 
system, and make bet ter  use of its fac i l i t ies ,  
than we can ourselves do at the moment; although 
we in tend it to produce  its own documentat ion. )  
The fac i l i t ies  ava i lab le  to the end user w i l l  
include: 
a) standard monol ingual text/document 
processing facilities, 
b) on - l ine  mono l ingua l  d ic t ionary  
update, into "supp lementary"  d ic t ionary  f i les  
for  la ter  b i l ingua l  complet ion  and fu l l  
incorporation by some lower- level  user, 
c) t ree -s t ructured  document  
organ isat ion ,  w i th  an assoc ia ted  d ic t ionary  
structure, that handles terminology, including 
proper  (e.g. procedure)  names, at d i f fe rent  
leve ls  of genera l i ty .  This is impor tant  from 
both mono l ingua l  and b i l ingua l  perspect ives .  
Monol ingual ly,  it provides a basis for indexing, 
document  re t r ieva l ,  g lossary  product ion ,  
spe l l ing  checks etc. B i l ingua l ly ,  in terms of 
t rans la t ion  into Japanese, these d is t inc t ions  
map wel l  onto orthographic conventions: general 
vocabulary is represented in kanji (ideographic) 
script, Japanese techn ica l  vocabu lary  from 
fore ign  languages  in kana ( Japanese sy l lab ic )  
script, and proper nouns such as procedure names 
are s imply  car r ied  over  in Roman (a lphabet ic )  
script. 
2) The second level of user, the high- level  
linguist, is responsible for writing the rules 
wh ich  compute  we l l - fo rmed sets  of  feature  
spec i f i ca t ions  (e.g. F -s t ructures)  f rom other  
sets, for source  language analys is ,  transfer,  
and target language synthesis. A variety of ruIe 
types could be provided for these purposes. The 
system as implemented supports the following: 
a) d ic t ionary  entries, wh ich  spec i fy  
id iosyncrat i c  in fo rmat ion  of al l  kinds. These 
def ine  a mapp ing  between lexemes  and 
(underdeterminsd)  sets  o f  feature  
specifications, for analysis, and between pairs 
of sets of feature specifications, for transfer. 
b) Context - f ree  rules, augmented  in 
the manner  of LFG or PATR II (Shieber 1984), 
that  is, regu lar  express ions  over  s t r ings  of 
sets of feature  spec i f i ca t ions  (i.e. lex ica l  
entr ies)  that def ine  a mapp ing  to h ie rarch ica l  
(dependency) representat ions.  
e) recurs ive ly  s t ructured  sets of 
features, permitting grouping of features along 
var ious  d imens ions ,  e.g.  noun/verb ,  
syntactic/semantic, lexical/phrasal, etc. 
d) feature co-occurrence restrictions 
(FCRs) in the manner  of GPSG. These can be used 
to  de f ine  sets  o f  features  as mutua l ly  
exc lus ive ,  and  to spec i fy  that  cer ta in  feature  
va lues  necessar i l y  fo l low from the presence or 
va lues  of o ther  features. 
e) de fau l t  .va lues  of  lex ica l  feature  
spec i f icat ions .  
f) ru les  wh ich  determine  (sur face)  
re la t iona l  labe ls  ,on the  bas is  o f  feature  
values.  By recogn is ing  these as a d is t inct  ru le  
type, we make a substant ive  c la im equ iva lent  to 
the  fo rmal  c la im embod ied  in the  typ ica l  LFG 
ana lys i s  of p repos i t iona l  phrases  - that  the  
va lue  of  a p repos i t iona l  feature  becomes  the  
re la t ion  of the (F-structure of the) PP to (that 
of) i ts  head.  
g) subcat  ru les ,  wh ich  re la te  
subcategor i sa t lon  features f rom the lex icon to 
funct ion -argument  (deep to sur face)  mapp ings .  
Such  features  may be spec i f ied  in a lex ica l  
ent ry  i t se l f ,  or  f i l l ed  in by FCR. Funct ion -  
a rgument  mapp ings  are  mere ly  pa i rs  of  atoms,  
that  i s ,  each  const i tuent  i s  mapped 
independent ly  of its sisters. This a l lows  us to 
def ine e f f io ient  contro l  s t rateg ies  over  these 
ru les  for use in e i ther  d i rect ion  - ana lys i s  or 
synthesis. The contro l  strategy, in combinat ion  
w i th  the  un iqueness  cond i t ion  on f - s t ruc tures ,  
embod ies  the  funct ion -argument  b iun iqueness  
pr inc ip le  of  Bresnan (1982,p163) ,  and rea l i ses  
the  coherence  cond i t ion .  Completeness  is 
spec i f ied  independent ly ,  or, in the case  of 
Japanese, not at all. 
The task  of the  h lgh- leve l  l ingu is t  is to 
de f ine  par t i cu la r  ins tances  of  ru les  of these  
types,  for  the  purpose  of  descr ib ing  texts  in a 
par t i cu la r  language and  "the re la t ionsh ip  
between texts in a par t i cu la r  pair  of languages. 
3) The  low- leve l  l ingu:\[st (the grammar  
des igner )  is respons ib le  fo r  de f in ing  the 
fo rmal i sm,  or  metatheory ,  in wh ich  the  h igh-  
leve l  l ingu is t  w i l l  work  (cf. Sh isber  1985). 
This includes:  
a)  def in ing  the nature  and number  of 
leve ls  o f  text  representat ion  dur ing  the  
t rans la t ion  process ?  Th is  inc ludes  dec id ing  
between phrase  s t ruc ture  and  dependency  
represe*r tat lons ,  the  par t i t ion  between the  
lex ica l  and syntact i c  colaponents in ana lys i s ,  
and the par t i t ion  between ana lys i s  and transfer. 
b) de f in ing  the ru le  types to re f lec t  
these  par t i t ions  and  spec i fy  the  mapp ings  
between levels .  
c) de f in i t ion  o f  the  dec la ra t ive  
semant ics  of the operators  by which the ru les  of 
var ious  types  are  app l ied ,  and  thence  the  
de f in i t ion  of the  compi la t ion  of l ingu is t i c  
informat ion.  
4) The  sys tem des igner  is concerned  w i th  
both  the  h ighest  and  lowest  leve ls  o f  the  
sys tem:  on  the  one  hand,  w i th  the  most  genera l  
overa l l  cons iderat ions  of system architecture,  
inc lud ing  the  po in ts  and  types  of  in teract ion ;  
on  the  o ther ,  w i th  ensur ing  that  the  
meta l ingu is t i c  dec is ions  made by tbe  grammar  
des igner  have  a t rac tab le  computat iona l  
rea l i sa t ion  (procedura l  semant ics )  and can  be 
in tegrated  wi th  interact ion.  
For  each  leve l  o f  user ,  there  is a 
d i f fe rent ,  appropr ia te  cor respondence  of  
p r iv i lege  and  respons ib i l i ty ;  each  shou ld  be 
ab le  to  use  h i s /her  spec ia l i s t  competence  
(monol ingua l  techn ica l  writ ing, the wr i t ing  of 
grammars, the  des ign of grammat ica l  theory, and 
the des igh of knowledge-based  systems) wi th  the 
fu l l  benef i t  of al I fac i l i t i es  def ined at lower 
leve ls ,  w i thout  c'oncern fo r  the  par t i cu la r  
deta i l s  of e i ther  lower - leve l  imp lementat ion  or 
h igher-  leve l  appl icat ion.  
Fur ther  cor respond ing  to these four c lasses  
of  user,  the  CCL  Japanese  sys tem incorporates  
in teract ive  rout ines  o f  var iab le  'user -  
f r iend l iness '  appropr ia te  to  the  presumed 
competence  of  a user  at that  leve l .  
The l ingu is t ,  for  example ,  can  enter  the 
grammar  to  rev ise  or  expand it. The  menu of  the  
"Grammar  Deve lopment  System"  at wh ich  the  h igh  
leve l  l ingu is t  is rooted prov ides  the opt ion  
Edit  a f i le  of l ingu is t i c  data. 
Th is  takes  one  to  n nested  menu wh ich  
prov ides  the a l te rnat ives :  
I. l ex icon  
2. grammar  
3. feature system 
Se lec t ing  "2" takes  one  to a fu r ther  menu 
cont ro l l ing  the ed i t ing of the augmented phrase 
s t ruc ture  ru les ,  f rom wh ich  one  can  choose  the  
appropr iate  rule, e.g. 
i. sentence 
2. nounphrase  
3. verb  phrase  
M\[ remove nontermina l  category  
N. add new nontermina l  category  
Cont ro l  l ing  access  to  l ingu is t i c  
in fo rmat ion  by  means  of menu ensures  that  the  
updated  f i les  are appropr ia te ly  recompi led  into 
the form used by the program. For instance, when 
the  grammar  wr i te r  updates  the  de f in i t ion  of 
feature sets  and/or  FCI~s, a compi la t ion  process  
is in i t ia ted .  Th is  expands  the  t ree  s t ruc ture  
into an extens iona l  de f in i t ion  of the procedure  
wh ich  adds  a feature  spec i f i ca t ion  to an f- 
s t ruc ture .  Th is  rea l i ses  f - s t ruc ture  (graph)

translat ion.  
For  open  c lass  words ,  on the  o ther  hand,  
where  update  by  the  end-user  is  the  norm,  
in teract ive  rout ines  are prov ided .  In these  
cases  the  user  never  sees  the  program form. 
Quest ions  are  asked  enab l ing  the  sys tem to 
determine the appropr ia te  in f lec t iona l  paradigm: 
syntact ic  category, mass (i.e. w i thout  a p lu ra l  
form) or  count, etc. P laus ib le  sur face forms are 
then generated  by a morpho log ica l  component,  and 
presented  to  the  user  fo r  conf i rmat ion  or  
cor rec t ion .  The  same component  is used  dur ing  
morpho log ica l  ana lys i s .  Thus  i f  the  user  
conf i rms the mach ine-generated  form, the machine 
w i l l  be  ab le  to  ana lyse  that  fo rm when i t  
appears in a text, and need not store it. 
331 
The syntact i c  and  semant ic  feature  
spec i f i ca t ions  for new d ic t ionary  ent r ies  are 
a lso  bu i l t  up in teract ive ly .  Where reasonab le  
defaults can be established, these are presented 
to the user for confirmation or override. Verbs, 
for example, are assumed to be transit ive unless 
the user  exerc i ses  the opt ion  to spec i fy  some 
other  va lency  pattern;  nouns are assumed to be 
countable. Where a va lue is less predictable, 
the user  is s imply  asked to prov ide  it: does a 
given noun denote a physical object, a software 
object,  or  an abst ract ion?  Verbs  are descr ibed  
w i th in  a mod i f ied  Vend ler /Dowty- type  
c lass i f i ca t ion  (Vend ler  1967, Dowry  1979, 
S teedman &Moens  1986); the user  is asked to 
spec i fy  the  appropr ia te  va lue  f rom a set  
inc lud ing  state, act iv i ty ,  ach ievement ,  and 
accomplishment. 
The menu in terpreter  c reates  and stores  
from this input a dictionary entry in a neutral 
format. Subsequent ly ,  th is  is compi led  to a 
program form entry. The new entries thus created 
are not added immediate ly  to the master  f i les, 
but are held in supplementary files, where they 
are ava i lab le  to the system, but a l so  c lear ly  
isolated for the high- level  linguist, who wi l l  
eventua l ly  add translat ion equivalents (of which 
the end-user  is p resumed to be ignorant)  and 
incorporate  the completed  ent r ies  into the 
master dict ionary(s).  
The c reat ion  of an in termediate  neut ra l -  
form d ic t ionary  o f fe rs  a fac i l i ty  for g loba l  
rev is ion  of the program form of the complete  
dictionaries. The neutral form and program form 
are related by FCRs which embody general isat ions 
about the syntactic behaviour of various Iexical 
features.  For instance,  the count /mass  feature 
on noun ent r ies  is re la ted  to two features  in 
the program form spec i fy ing  the va lues  for 
number  agreement  and eoocur rence  w i th  an 
article. The low- level  l inguist need only change 
such facts  and recompi le  the re levant  neut ra l  
fo rm f i les  to generate  a new program- form 
dictionary. 
Cur rent ly ,  the d ic t ionary  c reat ion  menu 
sys tem must  be  wr i t ten  by  hand.  We are  
exper iment ing  w i th  the  poss ib i l i ty  of  
constructing it automatical ly  from the feature 
system. 
4o Interact ive disambiguation 
The two principal considerations re levant  
to interact ive disambiguation are at what point 
it shou ld  take place,  and what  form it shou ld  
take. We wi l l  discuss these in order? 
i) Where should disambiguation take place? 
One answer  to the quest ion  of  when to 
in teractw i th  a user  is : st d i f fe rent  po ints  
accord ing  to the type of ambiguity.  We be l ieve  
that  th is  is not  the correct  answer, but that 
al l  ambiguity resolut ion should be deferred to 
t rans fer .  A d i s t inc t ion  between types  of  
ambigu i ty  accord ing  to the i r  po int  of o r ig in  
does not he lp  in the i r  reso lut ion.  Nor is it 
poss ib le  to draw a sharp d iv id ing  l ine between 
'spurious' and 'real' ambiguit ies.  Rather, we 
der ive  a character i sa t ion  of ambigu i ty  types 
f rom the types  of knowledge needed to reso lve  
them. 
Ambigu i t ies  reso lvab le  by syntact i c  
knowledge,  such as the ambigu i t ies  in major  
syntactic category so common in English, seem to 
present l i t t le problem. MT systems whose output 
is in tended for post -ed i t lng  o f ten  inc lude  a 
'homograph reso lut ion '  phase devoted  to this  
type of ambigu i ty  reso lut ion .  Though la rge ly  
successful, such an approach is obviated by the 
332 
use of the s imples t  phrase  s t ructure  grammars.  
Conversely, expl ic it  homograph resolut ion seems 
unavoidable when the system must not, under any 
c i rcumstances ,  re jec t  input  as i l l - fo rmed and 
untranslatable. (fn 5) 
Ambiguities reso lvab le  by consideration of 
the sub-categorisat ion/valency/case patterns of 
lex ica l  i tems inc lude  both  lex ica l  and  
a t tachment  ambigui t ies ,  but not a l l  cases of 
either. For instance: 
"... p rov ides  the in ter face  to the system" 
appears  to requ i re  domain  spec i f i c  knowledge;  
and 
"...is ach ieved  by ca l l ing  theprocedure  
X" 
requ i res  fa i r ly  soph is t i ca ted  knowledge 
concerning the re lat ive l ikel ihood of achieving 
s state by g iv ing  an ent i ty  a par t i cu la r  name or 
giving it control. 
The  quest ion  of  how an ambigu i ty  is 
reso lved  is thus a lmost  independent  of how it 
arises. Even word-class ambiguities occas ional ly  
persist through a syntactic analysis and require 
knowledge of the discourse for resolution, e.g. 
" load ing  ins t ruct ions  w i l l  s ta r t  
processing" 
A v iew of o rgan is ing  reso lu t ion  so that 
each  s tage  of  p rocess ing  reso lves  the  
ambiguities introduced by the previous stage is 
thus naive. 
In terms of interact ion,  quest ion ing  the 
user too early in the translat ion chain wi l l  be 
unacceptab le .  The  user  must  appear  to the  
disambiguator as just another knowledge source, 
the last to be exploited. 
If ambigu i t ies  are to remain  unreso lved  
through severa l  s tages  of process ing,  compact  
representat ions  of mul t ip le  read ings  of texts  
seem essent ia l .  The chart  (Kay, 1973, Mar t in  et 
al., 1981), and s imi lar  devices such as Tomita's 
(1985) 'shared packed forest' are impor tant  
contributions to the solut ion of this problem. 
The  approach  to ambigu i ty  typ ica l  in 
l ingu is t i c  theory  is to a l low the grammar  to 
induce it, and to t reat  the quest ion  of its 
compact representation as a matter for parsing, 
i r re levant  to dec la rat ive  descr ipt ion.  We are 
invest igat ing  the  a l te rnat ive  not ion  that  
l inguistic description itself should expl ic i t ly  
MndeKdeterm!ne  representat ion .  An approach  to 
syntactic underdetermination is that of Marcus 
(1985) .  We have  not  yet  examined i t s  
app l i cab i l i ty  to the cur rent  task. The 9R~\ [~ 
semant ics  of Aronof f  (1980, see a l so  M i l le r  
(197--87 ~-- Wood (1985) )  is  a theory  o f  
underdeterminat ion  of lex ica l  entries. Such 
lexical entries become more fu l ly  determined in 
context .  One might  say that  they  become 
ambiguated  and reso lved  s imul taneous ly .  (\]in 
fact, depend ing  on the use wh ich  is %o be made 
of the resu l ts  of analys is ,  they may never  
become determined.) This approach is appl icable 
even to ambiguities in major syntactic category. 
Then pars ing  can be cons idered  as ambiguat ing  
them to the  extent  l i censed  by the phrase  
structure rules and textual context. 
Such ideas are part icu lar ly  interesting in 
the context of our system. The GPSG-I ike feature 
sys tem is a means  fo r  descr ib ing  the  
redundancies in the lexicon; the LFG-l ike notion 
of mul t i - leve l  l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ion  (see 
l<aplan 1985) offers the possibi l i ty of ut i l is ing 
such descr ip t ions  to 'expand' the lex icon  in 
severa l  stages. In our system, ambigu i t ies  in 
subcategor i sa t ion  behav iour  ( inc lud ing  that 
between past  and pass ive  par t i c ip les )  do not  
exist during surface syntactic parsing. We think 
of such  an i tem as be ing  a s ing le  morph-  
syntactic entity, but a pair of 'semantic' ones. 
Thi's i s  important  in t rans lat ion,  s ince the 
indeterminac les  o f  the  source  language may or 
may not  become ambigu i t ies  in t rans la t ion .  For  
example,  the s ta te -event  ambiva lence  of pass ive  
participle,~\] in many languages  must  be recogn ised  
and reso lved  in t rans fer  to Japanese (though not 
in go ing  f rom French  to Eng l i sh ,  for  example) .  
For  a l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ion  of  the  source  
language not to inc lude  this ambiva lence  wou ld  
render  it incomplete;  for ana lys i s  to treat it, 
and many s imi la r  cases ,  as genu ine  ambigu i t ies  
wou ld  be prob lemat ic  COlnputationally, 
We be l ieve  that  tile invocat ion  or  
app l i ca t ion  of mono l ingua l  (source) knowledge by 
a b i l lngua\ ]  component  is an a t t rac t ive  approach 
to this problem. A good human trans\].ator infers  
f rom the  source  text  what  is  needed fo r  
t rans lat ion,  and a mach ine  system shou ld  exhib i t  
th i s  same, goa l -d r iven ,  behav iour .  In the  same 
way  that  a human t rans la tor ,  in  the  event  of 
be ing  unab le  to reso lve  an ambigu i ty  whose  
reso lu t ion  is  crucial,  fo r  t rans lat ion,  migIlt 
contact  the  or ig ina l  author ,  so the  mach ine 's  
knowledge must  be organ ised  to a l low the same 
fa i l - sa fe  interact ion.  
2) What form shou ld  in teract ion  take? 
We can  recogn ise  a var ie ty  of  fo rms that  
in teract ion  cou ld  take, on a sca le  of increas ing  
independence  f rom l ingu is t i c  ana lyses ,  as 
fol lows : 
a) P resentat ion  of  a l te rnat ives  as 
the i r  l ingu is t i c  representat ions  (e.g. t rees) .  
Though unsu i tab le  for  a l i ngu is t l ca l l y -na ive  
end-user, this type of in teract ion  is important  
dur ing system deve lopment .  Whi le  the h igh- leve l  
l ingu is t  is exper iment ing  with d i f ferent  ways in 
whicIl the s~stem's knowledge can be dep loyed  for 
sutomat ic  ambigu i ty  reso lu t ion ,  s /he  must  be 
ab le  to .inspect a deta i led  representat ion  of 
those  cases  where  tile cur rent  s t ra tegy  and/or  
knowledge are inadequate. In addit ion, this form 
of  p resentat ion  is  a p rerequ is i te  'to de f in ing  
more user - f r iend ly  forms? 
b) S t r ing  template  presentat ions .  At 
its s implest ,  for, say, at tachment  ambiguit ies,  
th i s  invo lves  present ing  tile ambiguous ly  
a t tached s t r ing  w i th  a s lo t  f i l l ed  by  the  
d i f fe rent  heads.  Th is  was  the  appnoach  adopted  
in Kay's  (1973) M IND system,  eog? 
"They f i l l ed  the tank wi th  gas" 
This means: 
1. F i l l ed  wi th  gas 
2. Tank  w i th  gas  
A more soph is t i ca ted  template  s t ructure  is 
used  by Tomi ta  (1985). Th is  invo lves  the  use  of  
what  Hudson  (1985)  has  te rmed 'natura l  
meta languago ' ,  e.g. 
"I saw a man in 'the park"  
i? The act ion  \[saw\] takes  p lace  \[ in the 
park\] 
2. \[a man\]  is \[ in the  park \ ]  
We be l ieve  that  th i s  is  an impor tant  
d i rec t ion  to  exp lore ,  though it  may lead  to 
obv ious  absurd i t ies ,  depend ing  on  the  
soph is t i ca t ion  w i th  wh ich  templates  are def ined  
and chosen ,  e.g. 
"Th is  modu le  prov ides  tile in ter face  to tile 
system" 
io The act ion \ [provides\]  takes p lace  \[to 
tile system\] 
2. \[Tile inter face\]  is \[to the system\] 
C) D isambiguat lng  paraphrase .  Th is  car* be 
i l l us t ra ted  for the same sentence as above: 
I. The  in ter face  to  the  sys tem is  
p rov ided  by this module.  
2. Th is  modu le  prov ides  the  sys tem 
wi th  an interface. 
The  success  o f  th i s  approach  depends  
c ruc ia l l y  on f ind ing the set of re la t iona l  ru les  
(in the  example ,  pass ive  and  benefact ive)  that  
w i l \ ]  generate  d i sambiguat ing  paraphrases .  We 
hope  that  our  approach  'to subcategor i sa t ion ,  
wi th  independent  funct ion -argument  mapp ings  for 
each  const i tuent ,  w i l l  make  th i s  poss ib le ,  but  
it is too  ear ly  to say. 
5. Imp l i ca t ions  and conc lus ions  
Our  pract i ca l  exper ience  of  imp lement ing  
the  CCL  Japanese  t : rans la t ion  sys tem,  some 
aspects  o f  wh ich  we have  descr ibed  above ,  
suggests  a number  of  po in ts  of  more  genera l  
in teres t  and  s ign i f i cance  fo r  mach ine  
t rans la t ion  and indeed for  any  computat iona l  
t reatment  of  natura l  language.  We w i l l  end  our  
paper  w i th  an ind icat ion  of  a few of these w ider  
imp l i ca t ions  and conc lus ions.  
It becomes increas ing ly  c lear  wi th  t ime and 
exper ience  that  mach ine  t rans la t ion  and  
l ingu is t i c  theory  can  be  o f  g reat  mutua l  
benefit? Ear ly  at tempts  at MT, which made l i t t le  
or  no use  of  any  sor t  o f  l ingu is t i c  theory ,  can  
now be seen as, in pr inc ip le ,  dead ends, desp i te  
the commex?c ia l  success  of  some (cf. Hutch ins  
1982). We can  now draw on a va luab le  body  of  
research, par t i cu la r ly  on syntax and semantics,  
which a l lows  us to hand le  language wi th  a depth 
and  soph is t i ca t ion ,  and  thus  a chance  o f  
adequate  t rans la t ion ,  far  g reater  than  was  
poss ib le  for tile ear ly  pioneerSo 
Converse ly ,  as we l l  as put t ing  a pract i ca l  
task  on a sound foot ing ,  tile g round ing  of  MT in 
l ingu is t i c  theory  prov ides  an ideal  tes t -bed for 
eva luat ion  and  deve lopment  of  such  a theory .  
Even  mono l ingua l  computat iona l  imp\ ] .ementat ion  
imposes  va luab le  demands  of  exp l i c i tness  and 
accuracy ,  and can  have  a s ign i f i cant  in f luence  
on the organizat ion,  content, and notat ion  of a 
theory (cf. the evo lu t ion  of GPSG, as descr ibed  
in Gazdar  et al 1985);  t rans la t ion  requ i res  a 
comprehens ive  and  t rac tab le  account  of  (at 
least) two languages  and of the mappings  between 
theta. It is a lso  easy to eva luate  one's resu l ts  
for beth thoroughness  of coverage  and qua l i ty  of 
output?  In o ther  words ,  the  pract i ce  of  mach ine  
l:ranslation shou ld  be seen  as a resource  for  
research  in l ingu is t i c  theory? 
Most  impor tant ly ,  we wou ld  l i ke  to  re-. 
a f f i rm our  espousa l  o f  in teract ive  sys tem 
des ign.  It shou ld  be uncontent lous  that  the 
pr inc ipa l  p rob lem in  the  des ign  of  any  
knowledge-based  sys tem is  the  t rans fer  of  
expert ise  f rom human to machine? 
Thus we have  des igned our  system with  three 
par t i cu la r  aims: 
i) to p rov ide  a means of express ing  eas i ly  
and  natu~-a\]  l y  the  fo rms of  knowledge we 
cur rent ly  understand;  
2) to recogn ise  and cope wi th  tile l imi ts  of 
cur rent ly  fo rmal l sed  knowledge,  by interact ion;  
3) to prov ide  an env i ronment  w i th in  wh ich  we 
can exper iment  w i th  redef in ing  those l imits.

i. Remark during discussion of King (1984). This 
v iewpoint ,  of course, begs the quest ion  of the

2. We have  g lossed  over  the mat ter  of t rans fer  
ambigu i t ies .  We assume that  these  can  be 
expressed  in source  language terms for  
interactive disambiguation. In this respect, the 
mach ine  is in a pre ferab le  pos i t ion  to that  of a 
human t rans la tor ,  who  must  in most  cases  
determine  the reso lu t ion  of such ambigu i t ies  
f rom the  text  a lone .  Were  our  assumpt ion  
incorrect ,  it wou ld  throw ser ious  doubt  on the 
possibi l i ty of human translation. 
3. We might even suggest that there is something 
pos i t ive ly  perverse about the assumption that a 
mach ine  wh ich  can in i so la t ion  conver t  raw to 
ha l f -baked (post -ed l ted)  or p re -cooked to 
f in i shed  text  (p re -ed i ted)  is in some way 
super io r  to one wh ich  can carry  out  the ent i re  
process  asked of it, recogn iz ing  the po ints  at 
wh ich  it needs  he lp  and tak ing  appropr ia te  
action. 
4. It shou ld  be po in ted  out here, however ,  that 
we do not  see  programming as inherent ly  
rad ica l ly  d i s t inc t  f rom other  types of formal  
descr ipt ion.  This is par t i cu la r ly  t rue for a 
h igh- level  "programming language" like Prolog. 
5. This is a good example  of how 'have a go at 
anyth ing '  sys tems may be  h indered  f rom 
incorporat ing  l ingu is t i ca l ly  mot ivated  
techniques.
