Abstract 
Low frequency words tend to be rich in content, and vice versa. But not all equally frequent words are 
equally mean!ngful. We will use inverse document frequency (IDF), a quantity borrowed from 
Information Retrieval, to distinguish words like somewhat and boycott. Both somewhat and boycott 
appeared approximately 1000 times in a corpus of 1989 Associated Press articles, but boycott is a better 
keyword because its IDF is farther from what would be expected by chance (Poisson). 
1. Document frequency is similar to word frequency, but different 
Word frequency is commonly used in all sorts of natural anguage applications. The practice implicitly 
assumes that words (and ngrams) are distributed by a single parameter distribution such as a Poisson or 
a Binomial. But we find that these distributions do not fit the data very well. Both the Poisson and 
Binomial assume that the variance over documents i no larger than the mean, and yet, we find that it 
can be quite a bit larger, especially for interesting words such as boycott where there are hidden 
variables uch as topic that conspire to undermine the independence assumption behind the Poisson and 
the Binomial. Much better fits are obtained by introducing a second parameter such as inverse 
document frequency (IDF). 
Inverse document frequency (IDF) is commonly used in Information Retrieval (Sparck Jones, 1972). 
IDF is defined as -log2dfw/D, where D is the number of documents in the collection and dfw is the 
document frequency, the number of documents that contain w. Obviously, there is a strong relationship 
between document frequency, dfw, and word frequency, fw. The relationship is shown in Figure 1, a 
plot of iog\]0fw and IDF for 193 words selected from a 50 million word corpus of 1989 Associated 
Press (AP) Newswire stories (D = 85,432 stories). 
Although log lofw is highly correlated with IDF (p =-0.994),  it would be a mistake to assume that the 
two variables are completely predictable from one another. Indeed, the experience of the Information 
Retrieval community has indicated that IDF is a very useful quantity. Attempts to replace IDF with fw 
(or some simple transform offw) have not been very successful. 
Figure 2 shows one such attempt. It compares the observed IDF with II~F, an estimate based on f 
Assume that a document is merely a "bag of words" with no interesting structure (content). Words are 
randomly generated by a Poisson process, n. The probability of k instances of a word w is n(0,k) 
fw where O= - - :

121 
e-O O k

In particular, the probability that w will not be found in a document is n(0,0). Conversely, the 
probability of at least one w is 1 -n (0 ,0) .  And therefore, IDF ought o be: 
119F = - log 2 ( 1 - rt (0,0) ) = - log 2 ( 1 - e - 0 ) Predicted IDF 
Figure 2 compares IDF with Ii)F. Note that I1)F is systematically too low, indicating that the 
predictions are missing crucial generalizations. Documents are more than just a bag of words. 
The prediction errors are shown in more detail in Figure 3, which plots the residual IDF (difference 
between predicted and observed) as a function of log lofw for the same 193 words shown in Figure 2. 
The prediction errors are relatively large in the middle of the frequency range, and smaller at both ends. 
Unfortunately, we believe the words in the middle are often the most important words for Information 
Retrieval purposes.

Figure 1" IDF is highly correlated with log frequency (p =-0.994). The 
circles show lOgl0f and IDF for 193 words selected from a corpus of 
1989 Associated Press Newswire stones (D = 85,432). 
2. A Good Keyword is far from Poisson 
To get a better look at the crucial differences between IDF and f in  the middle frequency range ~= 103), 
we selected a set of 53 words for further investigation with 1000 <f< 1020 in the 1989 AP corpus. The 
53 words are shown in Table 1, sorted by dr. Note that the words near the top of the list tend to be more 
appropriate for use in an information retrieval system than the words toward the bottom of the list. 
Stories that mention the word boycott, for example, are likely to be about boycotts. In contrast, stories 
that mention the word somewhat could be about practically anything.\]

observed IDF 
Figure 2: The observed IDF is systematically ower than what would be 
expected under a Poisson, - log2 ( 1 - e -ff/D ). All but 6 of the circles fall 
below the x =y line. The data are the same as in Figure 1. 
Why is IDF such a useful quantity? One might try to answer the question in terms of information 
theory (Shannon, 1948). IDF can be thought of as the usefulness in bits of a keyword to a keyword 
retrieval system. If we tell you that the document that we are looking for has the keyword boycott, then 
we have narrowed the search space down to just 676/D documents. 
But, this answer doesn't explain the fundamental difference between boycott and somewhat, boycott 
has an IDF of - log2676/D =7.0  bits, only a little more than somewhat, which has an IDF of 
- log 2 979/D = 6.4. And yet, boycott is a reasonable keyword and somewhat is not. 
A good keyword, like boycott, picks out a very specific set of documents. The problem with somewhat 
is that it behaves almost like chance (Poisson). Under a Poisson, the 1013 instances of somewhat 
should be found in approximately D( 1 - n (0 ,0 ) )  =D( 1 - n(1013/85432,0))  = 1007 documents. In fact, 
somewhat was found in 979 documents, only a little less than what would have been expected by 
chance. Good keywords tend to bunch up into many fewer documents, boycott, for example, bunches 
up into only 676 documents, much less than chance (D(1- r r (1009/85432,0) )=1003) .  Almost all 
words are more "interesting" in this sense than Poisson, but good keywords like boycott are a lot more 
interesting than Poisson, and crummy ones like somewhat are only a little more interesting than 
Poisson. 
There is a weak tendency for nouns to appear higher on the list than non-nouns, though tendency is too weak to 
explain the pattern of the systematic deviations from Poisson. In addition, there are plenty of exceptions in both 
directions: raPe, pool, grants, code and premier are not necessarily nouns, and sweeping, leads, bound and worry 
are not necessarily non-nouns.

Figure 3: The Prediction errors are systematically positive. The errors 
tend to be larger in the middle of the frequency range (Germans), and 
smaller at both ends (Fromm, which). The data are the same as in 
Figures 1-2. 
On this account, a good keyword is one that behaves very differently from the null hypothesis 
(Poisson). We conjecture that the best keywords tend to be found toward the middle of the frequency 
range, where there are relatively large deviations from Poisson, as illustrated in Figure 3. This 
hypothesis runs counter to the standard practice in Information Retrieval of weighting words by IDF, 
favoring extremely rare words, no matter how they are distributed. 
Of course, IDF is but one of many ways to show deviations from chance. Figure 4 shows the 
distributions for boycott and somewhat. Note that somewhat is much "closer" to Poisson in almost any 
sense of closeness that one might consider. Three measures of "closeness" are presented in Table 2: 
IDF, variance (o2), and entropy (H). Table 2 compares the top 10 words in Table 1 (labeled "better 
keywords") with the bottom 10 words in Table 1 (labeled "worse keywords"). The better keywords 
have more IDF, more variance and less entropy than what would be expected under a Poisson with 
O= f /D= 1000/85,432=0.012. 
3. How robust are these deviations f rom chance? 
We were concerned that the crucial deviations from Poisson behavior might not hold up if we looked at 
another corpus of similar material. Figure 5 shows the word boycott in five different years of the AP 
news. The "fat tails" show up in each of the five years. Clearly, the non-Poisson phenomenon is
robust. 
Figures 6 and 7 compare IDF and log 10 o 2 for the 53 words in Table 1, and find that IDF and log lo (I2 
are reasonably stable across years. The correlations of IDF and log 10 (y2 across years are presented in 
Tables 3-4. All of the correlations are quite large. The correlations for IDF are perhaps somewhat 
larger than those for log\]0 O2, suggesting that IDF may be somewhat more robust, which is not

Figure 4: Most words have a fatter tail than Poisson (solid line). The 
deviations from Poisson are more salient for good keywords like 
boycott, than for crummy keywords like somewhat. 
surprising iven that empirical estimates of variance are notoriously subject o outliers. None of the 
correlations in Tables 3 and 4 can be attributed to word frequency effects ince the 53 words were all 
chosen with almost he same 1989 frequency. 
In general, the correlations in Tables 3-4 are larger near the diagonal, suggesting that estimates degrade 
over time. If you want to predict next year's IDF, it is better to use this year's estimate than a ten-year- 
old estimate.

Figure 5: The strong deviations from Poisson for the word boycott show 
up very clearly in the AP in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 (dotted 
lines). Katz' K-mixture (Katz, personal communication), the solid line 
labelled "K ,"  fits the data better than the Poisson. 
Another way to confirm that our measurements of IDF, variance and H have consequences across years 
in the AP data, is to note that measurements of IDF, variance and H in 1989 can be used to predict word 
frequency in some other year. The correlations are shown in Table 5. They may not not be large, but 
they are too large to be due to chance and they all point in the same direction. The correlations cannot 
be attributed to variations in frequency in 1989, since all 53 words have almost the same 1989 
frequency. Clearly, there are some interesting systematic relationships between IDF/variance/H and f 
that hold up to replication across multiple years in the AP, measurement errors, and other sources of 
noise.

Figure 6: IDF in one year of the AP is very predictive of IDF in another 
(for the 53 words in Table 1). Each scatter plot compares IDF in one 
year with IDF in another. The fact that most of the points line up fairly 
well indicates that IDF values are strongly correlated across years. The 
correlations are shown in Table 3. 
4. Katz' K-mixture 
Clearly, the Poisson does not fit our data very well, especially for good keywords like boycott. 
however, a negative result. Can we say something more constructive? 
This is, 
Katz (personal communication) proposed the following alternative to the Poisson. Prg(k) is the 
probability of k instances of w in a document. 
o~ 13 k Prg(k) = ( l - c0  ~k,0 + ~-  (~- )  K-mixture 
5k,0 is 1 when k=0, and 0 otherwise. Katz' K-mixture distribution can be thought of as a mixture of 
Poissons. Suppose that, within documents, boycott is distributed by a Poisson process, but, across 
documents, the Poisson parameter 0 is allowed to vary from one document to another depending on 
how much the document is about boycotts. In other words, Prg(k) can be expressed as a convolution 
of Poissons with a density function ~: 
oo 
Pr(k) = f ~(0) n(O,k)dO for k = 0, 1, ? ? ? Poisson Mixture 
0 
In this way, the 0s can depend on an infinite number of unknowable hidden variables, e.g., what the 
documents are about, who wrote them, when they were written, what was going on in the world when 
they were written, etc., but we don't need to know these dependencies for any particular document. All 
we need to know is ~, the density of 0s, aggregated over all possible combinations of hidden variables.

Katz' K-mixture has two parameters, ccand \[3. The ~ parameter determines the fraction of relevant and 
irrelevant documents. 1 -  cx of the documents have no chance of mentioning boycott (0 = 0) because 
they are totally irrelevant o boycotts. The \[3 parameter determines the average 0 among the relevant 
documents. 
The two parameters, txand \[3, can be fit from almost any pair of variables considered thus far, e.g., f, 
IDF, t~ 2, H. We have found thatfand IDF are particularly easy to work with, and are more robust han 
some others such as ~2.

It has been our experience that Katz' K-mixture fits the data much better than the Poisson, as can be 
seen in Figure 5. Unlike the Poisson, the K-mixture has two parameters, tx and \[3, and can therefore 
account for the fact that IDF and fare not completely predictable from one another. 
In related work (Church and Gale, submitted), we looked at a number of different Poisson mixtures, and 
found that our data can also be fit by a negative binomial, which can be viewed as a Poisson mixture 
where Oun (0) is a Gamma distribution (Johnson and Kotz, 1969). See Mosteller and Wallace (1964) 
for an example of how to use the negative binomial in a Bayesian discrimination task. It is 
straightforward to generalize the Mosteller and Wallace approach to use Katz' K-mixture or any other 
mixture of Poissons. 
5. Conclusions 
Documents are much more than just a bag of words. The Poisson distribution predicts that lightning is 
unlike to strike twice in a single document. We shouldn't expect to see two or more instances of 
boycott in the same document (unless there is some sort of hidden dependency that goes beyond the 
Poisson). But when it rains, it pours. If a document is about boycotts, we shouldn't be surprised to find 
two boycotts or even a half dozen in a single document. The standard use of the Poisson in modeling 
the distribution of words and ngrams fails to fit the data except where there are almost no interesting 
hidden dependencies a in the case of somewhat. 
Why are the deviations from Poisson more salient for "interesting" words like boycott than for 
"boring" words like somewhat? Many applications uch as information retrieval, text categorization, 
author identification and word-sense disambiguation attempt to discriminate documents on the basis of 
certain hidden variables uch as topic, author, genre, style, etc. The more that a keyword (or ngram) 
deviates from Poisson, the stronger the dependence on hidden variables, and the more useful the 
keyword (or ngram) is for discriminating documents on the basis of these hidden dependences. Similar 
arguments apply in a host of other important applications uch as text compression and language 
modeling for speech recognition where it is desirable for word and ngram probabilities to adapt 
appropriately tofrequency changes due to various hidden dependencies. 
We have used document frequency, df, a concept borrowed from Information Retrieval, to find 
deviations from Poisson behavior. Document frequency is similar to word frequency, but different in a 
subtle but crucial way. Although inverse document frequency (IDF) and log 10f are extremely highly 
129 
correlated (p =-  0.994), it would be a mistake to try to model one with a simple transform of the other. 
Figure 5 showed one such attempt, where f was transformed into a predicted IDF by introducing a
Poisson assumption: I / )F=- log2( l -e - ? ) ,  with 0=--.fw Unfortunately, the prediction errors were 
D 
relatively large for the most important keywords, words with moderate frequencies such as Germans. 
To get a better look at the subtle differences between document frequency and word frequency, we 
focused our attention on a set of 53 words that all had approximately the same word frequency in a 
corpus of 1989 AP stories. Table 1 showed that words with larger IDF tend to have more content. 
boycott, for example, is a better keyword than somewhat because it bunches up into a relatively small 
set of documents. Table 2 showed that variance and entropy can also be used as a measure of content 
(at least among a set of words with more or less the same word frequency). A good keyword like 
boycott is farther from Poisson (chance) than a crummy keyword like somewhat by almost any sense of 
closeness that one might consider, e.g., IDF, variance, entropy. These crucial deviations from Poisson 
are robust. We showed in section 4 that deviations from Poisson in one year of the AP can be used to 
predict deviations in another year of the AP.
