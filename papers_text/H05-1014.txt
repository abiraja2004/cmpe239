Abstract
A challenge for search systems is to de-
tect not only when an item is relevant to
the user?s information need, but also when
it contains something new which the user
has not seen before. In the TREC novelty
track, the task was to highlight sentences
containing relevant and new information in
a short, topical document stream. This
is analogous to highlighting key parts of a
document for another person to read, and
this kind of output can be useful as input to
a summarization system. Search topics in-
volved both news events and reported opin-
ions on hot-button subjects. When peo-
ple performed this task, they tended to se-
lect small blocks of consecutive sentences,
whereas current systems identified many
relevant and novel passages. We also found
that opinions are much harder to track than
events.
1 Introduction
The problem of novelty detection has long been a sig-
nificant one for retrieval systems. The ?selective dis-
semination of information? (SDI) paradigm assumed
that the people wanted to be able to track new in-
formation relating to known topics as their primary
search task. While most SDI and information filter-
ing systems have focused on similarity to a topical
profile (Robertson, 2002) or to a community of users
with a shared interest (Belkin and Croft, 1992), re-
cent efforts (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Allan et
al., 2000; Kumaran et al, 2003) have looked at the
retrieval of specifically novel information.
The TREC novelty track experiments were con-
ducted from 2002 to 2004 (Harman, 2002; Soboroff
and Harman, 2003; Soboroff, 2004). The basic task
was defined as follows: given a topic and an ordered
set of documents related to that topic, segmented
into sentences, return those sentences that are both
relevant to the topic and novel given what has al-
ready been seen previously in that document set.
This task models an application where a user is skim-
ming a set of documents, and the system highlights
new, on-topic information.
There are two problems that participants must
solve in this task. The first is identifying relevant
sentences, which is essentially a passage retrieval
task. Sentence retrieval differs from document re-
trieval because there is much less text to work with,
and identifying a relevant sentence may involve ex-
amining the sentence in the context of those sur-
rounding it. The sentence was specified as the unit
of retrieval in order to standardize the task across a
variety of passage retrieval approaches, as well as to
simplify the evaluation.
The second problem is that of identifying those rel-
evant sentences that contain new information. The
operational definition of ?new? here is information
that has not appeared previously in this topic?s set
of documents. In other words, we allow the system to
assume that the user is most concerned about find-
ing new information in this particular set of docu-
ments, and is tolerant of reading information he al-
ready knows because of his background knowledge.
Since each sentence adds to the user?s knowledge,
and later sentences are to be retrieved only if they
contain new information, novelty retrieval resembles
a filtering task.
Novelty is an inherently difficult phenomenon to
operationalize. Document-level novelty detection,
while intuitive, is rarely useful because nearly ev-
ery document contains something new, particularly
when the domain is news. Hence, our decision to
use sentences as the unit of retrieval. Moreover, de-
termining ground truth for a novelty detection task
is more difficult than for topical relevance, because
one is forced not only to face the idiosyncratic na-
105
ture of relevance, but also to rely all the more on
the memory and organizational skills of the assessor,
who must try and remember everything he has read.
We wanted to determine if people could accomplish
this task to any reasonable level of agreement, as well
as to see what computational approaches best solve
this problem.
2 Input Data
The first year of the novelty track (Harman, 2002)
was a trial run in several ways. First, this was a new
task for the community and participating groups had
no training data or experience. But second, it was
unclear how humans would perform this task and
therefore creating the ?truth? data was in itself a
large experiment. NIST decided to minimize the cost
by using 50 old topics from TRECs 6, 7, and 8.
The truth data was created by asking NIST asses-
sors (the humans performing this task) to identify
the set of relevant sentences from each relevant doc-
ument and then from that set of relevant sentences,
mark those that were novel. Specifically, the asses-
sors were instructed to identify a list of sentences
that were:
1. relevant to the question or request made in the
description section of the topic,
2. their relevance was independent of any sur-
rounding sentences,
3. they provided new information that had not
been found in any previously picked sentences.
Most of the NIST assessors who worked on this
task were not the ones who created the original top-
ics, nor had they selected the relevant documents.
This turned out to be a major problem. The as-
sessors? judgments for the topics were remarkable
in that only a median of 2% of the sentences were
judged to be relevant, despite the documents them-
selves being relevant. As a consequence, nearly ev-
ery relevant sentence (median of 93%) was declared
novel. This was due in large part to assessor dis-
agreement as to relevancy, but also that fact that
this was a new task to the assessors. Additionally,
there was an encouragement not to select consecu-
tive sentences, because the goal was to identify rel-
evant and novel sentences minimally, rather than to
try and capture coherent blocks of text which could
stand alone. Unfortunately, this last instruction only
served to confuse the assessors. Data from 2002 has
not been included in the rest of this paper, nor are
groups encouraged to use that data for further ex-
periments because of these problems.
In the second year of the novelty track (Soboroff
and Harman, 2003), the assessors created their own
new topics on the AQUAINT collection of three con-
temporaneous newswires. For each topic, the asses-
sor composed the topic and selected twenty-five rele-
vant documents by searching the collection. Once se-
lected, the documents were ordered chronologically,
and the assessor marked the relevant sentences and
those relevant sentences that were novel. No instruc-
tion or limitation was given to the assessors concern-
ing selection of consecutive sentences, although they
were told that they did not need to choose an other-
wise irrelevant sentence in order to resolve a pronoun
reference in a relevant sentence. Each topic was in-
dependently judged by two different assessors, the
topic author and a ?secondary? assessor, so that the
effects of different human judgments could be mea-
sured. The judgments of the primary assessor were
used as ground truth for evaluation, and the sec-
ondary assessor?s judgments were taken to represent
a ceiling for system performance in this task.
Another new feature of the 2003 data set was a di-
vision of the topics into two types. Twenty-eight of
the fifty topics concerned events such as the bombing
at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, while the remain-
ing topics focused on opinions about controversial
subjects such as cloning, gun control, and same-sex
marriages. The topic type was indicated in the topic
description by a <toptype> tag.
This pattern was repeated for TREC 2004 (Sobo-
roff, 2004), with fifty new topics (twenty-five events
and twenty-five opinion) created in a similar man-
ner and with the same document collection. For
2004, assessors also labeled some documents as irrel-
evant, and irrelevant documents up through the first
twenty-five relevant documents were included in the
document sets distributed to the participants. These
irrelevant documents were included to increase the
?noise? in the data set. However, the assessors only
judged sentences in the relevant documents, since,
by the TREC standard of relevance, a document is
considered relevant if it contains any relevant infor-
mation.
3 Task Definition
There were four tasks in the novelty track:
Task 1. Given the set of documents for the topic,
identify all relevant and novel sentences.
Task 2. Given the relevant sentences in all docu-
ments, identify all novel sentences.
Task 3. Given the relevant and novel sentences in
the first 5 documents only, find the relevant
106
and novel sentences in the remaining documents.
Note that since some documents are irrelevant,
there may not be any relevant or novel sentences
in the first 5 documents for some topics.
Task 4. Given the relevant sentences from all doc-
uments, and the novel sentences from the first
5 documents, find the novel sentences in the re-
maining documents.
These four tasks allowed the participants to test
their approaches to novelty detection given different
levels of training: none, partial, or complete rele-
vance information, and none or partial novelty infor-
mation.
The test data for a topic consisted of the topic
statement, the set of sentence-segmented documents,
and the chronological order for those documents. For
tasks 2-4, training data in the form of relevant and
novel ?sentence qrels? were also given. The data was
released and results were submitted in stages to limit
?leakage? of training data between tasks. Depending
on the task, the system was to output the identifiers
of sentences which the system determined to contain
relevant and/or novel relevant information.
4 Evaluation
Because novelty track runs report their relevant and
novel sentences as an unranked set, traditional mea-
sures of ranked retrieval effectiveness such as mean
average precision can?t be used. One alternative is
to use set-based recall and precision. Let M be the
number of matched sentences, i.e., the number of
sentences selected by both the assessor and the sys-
tem, A be the number of sentences selected by the
assessor, and S be the number of sentences selected
by the system. Then sentence set recall is R = M/A
and precision is P = M/S.
However, set-based recall and precision do not av-
erage well, especially when the assessor set sizes A
vary widely across topics. Consider the following ex-
ample as an illustration of the problems. One topic
has hundreds of relevant sentences and the system
retrieves 1 relevant sentence. The second topic has 1
relevant sentence and the system retrieves hundreds
of sentences. The average for both recall and preci-
sion over these two topics is approximately .5 (the
scores on the first topic are 1.0 for precision and es-
sentially 0.0 for recall, and the scores for the second
topic are the reverse), even though the system did
precisely the wrong thing. While most real systems
wouldn?t exhibit this extreme behavior, the fact re-
mains that set recall and set precision averaged over
a set of topics is not a robust diagnostic indicator

of system performance. There is also the problem
of how to define precision when the system returns
no sentences (S = 0). Leaving that topic out of the
evaluation for that run would mean that different
systems would be evaluated over different numbers
of topics. The standard procedure is to define preci-
sion to be 0 when S = 0.
To avoid these problems, the primary measure
used in the novelty track was the F measure. The
F measure (which is itself derived from van Rijsber-
gen?s E measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979)) is a function
of set recall and precision, together with a parameter
? which determines the relative importance of recall
and precision:
F = (?
2 + 1)PR
?2P + R
A ? value of 1, indicating equal weight, is used in
the novelty track:
F?=1 =
2PR
P + R
Alternatively, this can be formulated as
F?=1 =
2? (# relevant retrieved)
(# retrieved) + (# relevant)
For any choice of ?, F lies in the range [0, 1], and
the average of the F measure is meaningful even when
the judgment sets sizes vary widely. For example,
the F measure in the scenario above is essentially
0, an intuitively appropriate score for such behavior.
Using the F measure also deals with the problem of
107
what to do when the system returns no sentences
since recall is 0 and the F measure is legitimately 0
regardless of what precision is defined to be.
Note, however, that two runs with equal F scores
do not indicate equal precision and recall. The con-
tour lines in Figure 1 illustrate the shape of the F
measure in recall-precision space. An F score of 0.5,
for example, can describe a range of precision and re-
call scores. Figure 1 also shows the per-topic scores
for a particular TREC run. It is easy to see that
topics 98, 83, 82, and 67 exhibit a wide range of per-
formance, but all have an F score of close to 0.6.
Thus, two runs with equal F scores may be perform-
ing quite differently, and a difference in F scores can
be due to changes in precision, recall, or both. In
practice, if F is used, precision and recall should also
be examined, and we do so in the analysis which fol-
lows.
5 Analysis
5.1 Analysis of truth data
Since the novelty task requires systems to automat-
ically select the same sentences that were selected
manually by the assessors, it is important to ana-
lyze the characteristics of the manually-created truth
data in order to better understand the system re-
sults. Note that the novelty task is both a passage
retrieval task, i.e., retrieve relevant sentences, and
a novelty task, i.e., retrieve only relevant sentences
that contain new information.
In terms of the passage retrieval part, the TREC
novelty track was the first major investigation into
how users select relevant parts of documents. This
leads to several obvious questions, such as what per-
centage of the sentences are selected as relevant, and
do these sentences tend to be adjacent/consecutive?
Additionally, what kinds of variation appear, both
across users and across topics. Table 1 shows the
median percentage of sentences that were selected
as relevant, and what percentage of these sentences
were consecutive. Since each topic was judged by two
assessors, it also shows the percentage of sentences
selected by assessor 1 (the ?official? assessor used in
scoring) that were also selected by assessor 2. The
table gives these percentages for all topics and also
broken out into the two types of topics (events and
opinions).
First, the table shows a large variation across the
two years. The group in 2003 selected more rele-
vant sentences (almost 40% of the sentences were se-
lected as relevant), and in particular selected many
consecutive sentences (over 90% of the relevant sen-
tences were adjacent). The median length of a string
of consecutive sentences was 2; the mean was 4.252
sentences. The following year, a different group of
assessors selected only about half as many relevant
sentences (20%), with fewer consecutive sentences.
This variation across years may reflect the group of
assessors in that the 2004 set were TREC ?veterans?
and were more likely to be very selective in terms of
what was considered relevant.
The table also shows a variation across topics, in
particular between topics asking about events versus
those asking about opinions. The event topics, for
both years, had more relevant sentences, and more
consecutive sentences (this effect is more apparent in
2004).
Agreement between assessors on which sentences
were relevant was fairly close to what is seen in docu-
ment relevance tasks. There was slightly more agree-
ment in 2003, but there were also many more relevant
sentences so the likelihood of a match was higher.
There is more agreement on events than on opinions,
partially for the same reason, but also because there
is generally less agreement on what constitutes an
opinion. These medians hide a wide range of judging
behavior across the assessors, particularly in 2003.
The final two rows of data in the table show the
medians for novelty. There are similar patterns to
those seen in the relevant sentence data, with the
2003 assessors clearly being more liberal in judging.
However, the pattern is reversed for topic types, with
more sentences being considered relevant and novel
for the opinion topics than for the event topics. The
agreement on novelty is less than on relevance, par-
ticularly in 2004 where there were smaller numbers
of novel and relevant sentences selected.
Another way to look at agreement is with the
kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960). Kappa computes
whether two assessors disagree, with a correction for
?chance agreement? which we would expect to occur
randomly. Kappa is often interpreted as the degree
of agreement between assessors, although this inter-
pretation is not well-defined and varies from field
to field (Di Eugenio, 2000). For relevant sentences
across all topics in the 2004 data set, the kappa value
is 0.549, indicating statistically significant agreement
between the assessors but a rather low-to-moderate
degree of agreement by most scales of interpretation.
Given that agreement is usually not very high for
relevance judgments (Voorhees, 1998), this is as ex-
pected.
5.2 Analysis of participants results
Most groups participating in the 2004 novelty track
employed a common approach, namely to measure
relevance as similarity to the topic and novelty as

dissimilarity to past sentences. On top of this frame-
work the participants used a wide assortment of
methods which may be broadly categorized into sta-
tistical and linguistic methods. Statistical methods
included using traditional retrieval models such as
tf.idf and Okapi coupled with a threshold for retriev-
ing a relevant or novel sentence, expansion of the
topic and/or document sentences using dictionaries
or corpus-based methods, and using named entities
as features. Some groups also used machine learning
algorithms such as SVMs in parts of their detection
process. Semantic methods included deep parsing,
matching discourse entities, looking for particular
verbs and verb phrases in opinion topics, coreference
resolution, normalization of named entities, and in
one case manual construction of ontology?s for topic-
specific concepts.
Figure 2 shows the Task 1 results for the top run
from each group in TREC 2004. Groups employing
statistical approaches include UIowa, CIIR, UMich,
and CDVP. Groups employing more linguistic meth-
ods include CLR, CCS, and LRI. THU and ICT took
a sort of kitchen-sink approach where each of their
runs in each task tried different techniques, mostly
statistical.
The F scores for both relevance and novelty re-
trieval are fairly uniform, and they are dominated by
the precision component. The top scoring systems by
F score are largely statistical in nature; for example,
see (Abdul-Jaleel et al, 2004) (CIIR) and (Eichmann
et al, 2004) (UIowa). CLR (Litkowski, 2004) and

Figure 2: Task 1 precision, recall, and F scores for
the top run from each group in TREC 2004
LRI (Amrani et al, 2004), which use much stronger
linguistic processing, achieve the highest precision at
the expense of recall. Overall, precision is quite low
and recall is high, implying that most systems are
erring in favor of retrieving many sentences.
A closer comparison of the runs among them-
selves and to the truth data confirms this hypothe-
sis. While the 2004 assessors were rather selective in
choosing relevant and novel sentences, often selecting
just a handful of sentences from each document, the
systems were not. The systems retrieved an average
of 49.5% of all sentences per topic as relevant, com-
pared to 19.2% chosen by the assessor. Furthermore,
the runs chose 41% of all sentences (79% of their own
relevant sentences) as novel, compared to the asses-
sor who selected only 8.4%. While these numbers
are a very coarse average that ignores differences be-
tween the topics and between the documents in each
set, it is a fair summary of the data. Most of the sys-
tems called nearly every sentence relevant and novel.
By comparison, the person attempting this task (the
second assessor, scored as a run and shown as hor-
izontal lines in Figure 2) was much more effective
than the systems.
The lowest scoring run in this set, LRIaze2, actu-
ally has the highest precision for both relevant and
109
novel sentences. The linguistics-driven approach of
this group included standardizing acronyms, build-
ing a named-entity lexicon, deep parsing, resolving
coreferences, and matching concepts to manually-
built, topic-specific ontologies (Amrani et al, 2004).
A close examination of this run?s pattern shows that
they retrieved very few sentences, in line with the
amounts chosen by the assessor. They were not of-
ten the correct sentences, which accounts for the low
recall, but by not retrieving too many false alarms,
they managed to achieve a high precision.
Our hypothesis here is that the statistical systems,
which are essentially using algorithms designed for
document retrieval, approached the sentences with
an overly-broad term model. The majority of the
documents in the data set are relevant, and so many
of the topic terms are present throughout the docu-
ments. However, the assessor was often looking for
a finer-grained level of information than what ex-
ists at the document level. For example, topic N51
is concerned with Augusto Pinochet?s arrest in Lon-
don. High-quality content terms such as Pinochet,
Chile, dictator, torture, etc appear in nearly every
sentence, but the key relevant ones ? which are very
few ? are those which specifically talk about the ar-
rest. Most systems flagged nearly every sentence as
relevant, when the topic was much narrower than the
documents themselves.
One explanation for this may be in how thresholds
were learned for this task. Since task 1 provides no
data beyond the topic statement and the documents
themselves, it is possible that systems were tuned
to the 2003 data set where there are more relevant
sentences. However, this isn?t the whole story, since
the difference in relevant sentences between 2003 and
2004 is not so huge that it can explain the rates of re-
trieval seen here. Additionally, in task 3 some topic-
specific training data was provided, and yet the ef-
fectiveness of the systems was essentially the same.
Of those systems that tried a more fine-grained
approach, it appears that it is complicated to learn
exactly which sentences contain the relevant informa-
tion. For example, nearly every system had trouble
identifying relevant opinion sentences. One might
expect that those systems which analyzed sentence
structure more closely would have done better here,
but there is essentially no difference. Identifying rel-
evant information at the sentence level is a very hard
problem.
We see very similar results for novel sentence re-
trieval. Rather than looking at task 1, where systems
retrieved novel from their own selection of relevant
sentences, it?s better to look at runs in task 2 (Fig-
ure 3). Since in this task the systems are given all rel-

Figure 3: Task 2 scores for the top run from each
group in TREC 2004
evant sentences and just search for novelty, the base-
line performance for comparison is just labeling all
the sentences as novel. Most systems, surprisingly in-
cluding the LRI run, essentially do retrieve nearly ev-
ery sentence as novel. The horizontal lines show the
baseline performance; the baseline recall is 1.0 and is
at the top of the Y axis. All the runs except clr04n2
are just above this baseline, with cdvp4NTerFr1 and
novcolrcl the most discriminating.
The approach of Dublin City University
(cdvp4NTerFr1) is essentially to set a thresh-
old on the tf.idf value of the unique words in the
given sentence, but their other methods which incor-
porate the history of unique terms and the difference
in sentence frequencies between the current and
past sentences perform comparably (Blott et al,
2004). Similarly, Columbia University (novcolrcl)
focuses on previously unseen words in the current
sentence as the main evidence of novelty (Schiffman
and McKeown, 2004). As opposed to the ad hoc
threshold in the DCU system, Columbia employs
a hill-climbing approach to learning the threshold.
This particular run is optimized for recall; another
optimized for precision achieved the highest preci-
sion of all task 2 runs, but with very low recall. In
general, we conclude that most systems achieving
high scores in novelty detection are recall-oriented
and as a result still provide the user with too much
information.
As was mentioned above, opinion topics proved
much harder than events. Every system but one did
better on event topics than on opinions in task 1

Figure 4: F scores for event and opinion topics in
task 1.
(Figure 4). In task 2, where all relevant sentences
were provided, many runs do as well or better on
opinion topics than events. Thus, the complexity for
opinions is more in finding which sentences contain
them, than determining which opinions are novel.
6 Conclusion
The novelty track in TREC examined a particular
kind of novelty detection, that is, finding novel, on-
topic sentences within documents that the user is
reading. Both statistical and linguistic techniques, as
well as filtering and learning approaches can be ap-
plied to detecting novel relevant information within
documents, but nevertheless it is a hard problem for
several reasons. First, because the unit of interest
is a sentence, there is not a lot of data in each unit
on which to base the decision. When the document
as a whole is relevant, techniques designed for docu-
ment retrieval seem unable to make fine distinctions
about which sentences within the document contain
the relevant information. Initial threshold setting is
critical and difficult.
When we examined human performance on this
task, it is clear that users do make very fine distinc-
tions. Looking particularly at the 2004 set of relevant
and novel sentences, less than 20% of the sentences
in relevant documents were marked as relevant, and
only 40% of those (or 8% of the total sentences) were
marked as both relevant and novel.
The TREC novelty data sets themselves support
some interesting uses outside of the novelty track.
Whereas the data from 2002 is clearly flawed and
should not be used, the data from 2003 and 2004
can be regarded as valid samples of user input in
terms of relevant sentence selection, and further re-
duction of those sentences to those presenting new
information. One obvious use is in the passage re-
trieval arena, e.g., using the relevant sentences for
testing passage retrieval, either at the single sentence
level or using the consecutive sentences to test when
to retrieve multiple sentences. A second use is for
summarization, where the relevant AND novel sen-
tences can serve as the truth data for the extraction
phase (and then compressed in some manner). Other
uses of the data include manual analysis of user be-
havior when processing documents in response to a
question, or looking further into the user agreement
issues, particularly in the summarization area.
The novelty data is also unique in that it delib-
erately contains a mix of topics on events and on
opinions regarding controversial subjects. The opin-
ions topics are quite different in this regard than
other TREC topics, which have historically focused
on events or narrative information on a subject or
person. This exploration has been an interesting and
fruitful one. By mixing the two topic types within
each task, we see that identifying opinions within
documents is hard, even with training data, while
detecting new opinions (given relevance) seems anal-
ogous to detecting new information about an event.
