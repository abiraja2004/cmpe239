In t roduct ion  
In our  work  on  ana lyz ing  Swed ish  nomina l  phrases  as  they  
appear  as  document  t i t les  - par t i cu la r ly  t i t les  o f  a r t i c les  in  per i -  
od ica ls  - we  have  pr imar i ly  u t i l i zed  context - f ree  ru les .  In an  
endeavour  to  reduce  the  cumbersomeness  of  such  ru les ,  we  
have  used  the  notat ion :  
(1) a b ~ c fo r  x = p, q, r and  y = u,  v xy  xy  xy  
as  a shor thand fo r  s ix  substant ia l l y  s imi la r  ru les .  The  ga in  i s  
not  mere ly  that  of  avo id ing  sc r ivener ' s  pa lsy  - and  puncher ' s  
impat ience ,  s ince  the  ana lys i s  p rogram a lso  accepts  th i s  shor t -  
hand - but  a l so  that  of  c la r i fy ing  the  para l le l i sm between the  ru les .  
The  ru le  schema reads  Ha syntagm of type  a combines  w i th  one  of  
type  b to  fo rm one  of  type  c ,  each  be ing  respect ive ly  of  subc lass  
p,  q o r  r and  u or  v '~. I f  the  subscr ip ts  a re  in terpretab le  as

what  these  ru les  a re  requ i red  to  do  in  the  domain  where  we 
have  a cho ice ,  namely  to  br ing  out  the  common pat tern  and  
leave  as ide  fo r  la ter  cons iderat ion  the  minor  ad jus tments .  
Now,  in  pract i ce ,  we  have  fo r  each  word  or  syntagm not  
one  subscr ip t  but  a set  of  a l te rnat ive  subscr ip ts .  On  the  in i t ia -  
t i ve  o f  Gunnar  Ehr l ing ,  who wrote  the  ana lyzer ,  we  fur ther  re -  
duce  the  notat ion  by  g iv ing  a name to a l l  such  sets  of  a l te rna-  
t i ves  and  by  spec i fy ing  in  a "mul t ip l i ca t ion  tab le ' the  name o f  
the  set  o f  a l te rnat ives  fo rming  the  in tersect ion  between any  pa i r  
o f  such  sets .  Thus ,  in  p lace  o f  (1) our  ru les  ac tua l ly  read

where  the  va lues  o f  i f l j  and  kN1 are  taken  f rom the  "mul t ip l i -

We now ask  what  w i l l  happen i f  we  genera l i ze  th i s  index  
"mul t ip l i ca t ion"  so  that  i t  w i l l  represent  not  in tersect ion  of  in -  
dex  sets  but  an  arb i t ra ry  b inary  operat ion  on  the  set  of  index  
symbols .  Par t i cu la r ly ,  we  are  in teres ted  in  the  case  where  
th i s  mul t ip l i ca t ion  i s  non-assoc ia t ive  and  the  set  o f  index  sym-  
bo ls  i s  not  c losed  under  mul t ip l i ca t ion .  Th is  wou ld  mean that  
the  res t r i c t ions  imposed by  the  indexes  on  the  sentence  or  par t  
thereof  cou ld ,  in  the i r  tu rn ,  be  wr i t ten  as  a context - f ree  - not  
a f in i te -s ta te  - g rammar  over  the  index  symbols .  
When the  subscr ip t  mul t ip l i ca t ion  ru les  a re  genera l i zed  
so  fa r ,  they  are  of  the  same k ind  as  the  " " ' on  mul t lphcat ion"  the

We note  that ,  in  genera l ,  these  ru les  cannot  be  reduced 
to  a f in i te  l i s t  o f  common context - f ree  ru les ,  as  cou ld  ru les  
l i ke  ( i )  and  (Z).  For  i f  we  can  rep lace  ab  by  c, we  may we l l

co lumn j,  s ince  i and  j may,  in  tu rn ,  be  s t r ings  and  not  e le -

indexes  are  de f ined  by  a genera l  context - f ree  grammar  and  
not  by  a f in i te -s ta te  one ,  we  cannot  remedy th i s  by  add ing  more  
symbols  to  the  index  set :  the  set  of  t r ip les  i ,  j ,  i j  may  then  
be  in f in i te .  
Th is  paper  i s  an  a t tempt  to  invest igate  th i s  p rob lem,

we may be excused for making a summary  of the background 
of the recognition grarnrnar problems for which such a calculus 
may be useful. The reader who expects tD be bored by such a

L = L (S ,  R,  I, L '  )

We say  that  G"  = <S,  R ,  I, A> i s  a ~rammar  component  and  
note  that  G"  and  G I together  complete ly  spec i fy  L .  We sha l l

1. A reduct ion  ru le  where  the  r ight  hand s ide  conta ins  ex -  
ac t ly  one symbo l  i s  ca l led  a context - f ree  ru le .  I f  a l l  the ru les  
a re  context - f ree  we say  the  grammar  and  the  language is  con-  
text - f ree .  
I f  the  grammar  is  context - f ree  we may g ive  it  the fo l -  
l ow ing  in terpretat ion .  Let  the  le t te rs  of  I be  sets ,  "categor ies" ,  
of s t r ings  of l ingu is t i c  s igns .  Let  a._.bb mean the set  of s t r ings  
cons is t ing  of one s t r ing  conta ined  in  category  a fo l towed by  one  
conta ined  in b . Le t  the  reduct ion  ru les  mean inc lus ion  so  that ,  
e .g . ,  ab  c c means  that  the  set  a~b i s  inc luded in the  set  c .  
A s t r ing  o over  I then  represents  a grammat ica l  sentence  
of type  t , i f  and  on ly  i f ,  R m (yc  t sT .  
2. A context - f ree  const i tuent  g rammar ,  then ,  can  be ade-  
quate ly  descr ibed  as  a c lass i f i ca t iona l  sys tem wi th  f iner  and  
broader  te rms where  a l l  c lasses  can  be wr i t ten  as  cdncatena-  
t ions  - in terpreted  as  the  set  of concatenat ions  of the car tes ian  
products  - of a f in i te  se t  S of ca tegor ies .  The  process  of ana-  
l yz ing  sentences  of such  a language can  be per fo rmed as  a c las -  
s i f i ca t iona l  p rocedure  and  the  resu l t  i s  adequate ly  and  exhaust ive ly  
s ta tab le  as  the c lass  adherence  of se ts  of success ive  subst r ings ,  
representab le ,  e .g . ,  by a t ree  wi th  no c ross ing  branches .  
One may note that  the character  of a context - f ree  language 
we l l  con forms wi th  what  used  to be def ined  as  agg lu t inat ive  lan -  
guages ,  that  i s  w i th  the agg lu t inat ive  languages  as  they  were  
commonly  def ined,  not as  any  ex is t ing  natura l  l anguage of any  
par t i cu la r  group.  
The assumpt ions  beh ind an a t tempt  to descr ibe  a rea l  
language by a context - f ree  grammar ,  there fore ,  a re  very  
s t rong .  It i s  not as ton ish ing  that  these  a t tempts  par t ia l l y  fa i l ;  
i t  i s  as ton ish ing  that  they  have  car r ied  as  fa r  as  they  have .  For  
ins tance ,  there  i s  no conv inc ing  empi r i ca l  ev idence  that  a dec i -  
s ion  grammar  for  a natura l  l anguage cannot  be wr i t ten  as  a 
context - f ree  grammar ,  though there  are  ample  theoret i ca l  rea -  
sons  not to s take  too much on the pred ic t ion  that  no pract i ca l  
counter -examples  w i l l  tu rn  up in the fu ture .  
3. If we add to our  context - f ree  grammar  ru les  of the type 
ab .-* bc  
or,  genera l ly ,  permutat ion  ru les  where  the same e lements  recur  
on the r ight ,  though in d i f fe rent  o rder ,  we broadens  of course ,  
the fami ly  of languages  under  cons iderat ions  and the in terpreta -  
t ion above under  2. no more  ho lds  t rue .  But  a l l  what  was  sa id  
about  the h igh ly  spec ia l i zed  character  of the languages  remains  
t rue ,  except  that  c lass  adherence  i s  now not conf ined to se ts  
of success ive  subst r ings ;  the language i s  character i zed  by the 
ex is tence  of d i scont inuous  const i tuents~ and except  that  the t ree  
drawn w i l l  have  c ross ing  branches  here  and there .  But i t  i s  s t i l l  
poss ib le  to ass ign  each  subst r ing  to exact ly  one immediate ly  
h igher  o rder  const i tuent  and  i t  i s  s t i l l  poss ib le  to  draw a t ree .  
We may summar ize  the  const i tuent  
so  fa r  ment ioned under  the  name ~-const i tuent  grammars ,  
i .e . ,  g rammars  where  each  const i tuent  i s  e i ther  d i s jo in t  f rom 
or  inc luded in  another  and  where ,  accord ing ly ,  the  const i tuents  
can  be  def ined  as  a h ie rarch ia l  se t  of  equ iva lence  c lasses  over  
the  subst r ings  of  the  g iven  input  s t r ing .  
Such  a c lass i f i ca t ion  of  subst r ings  i s  ca l led  a p -marker .  
The  hope  of  express ing  the  essence  of  the  syntact i ca l  s t ruc ture  
of  a sentence  by  one  p -marker  there fore  imp l ies  s t rong  assump-  
t ions  about  the  language.  
Over lapp ing  const i tuent  grammar  
I f  the  ru les  of  R do  not  obey  the  res t r i c t ions  ment ioned 
fo r  d i s jo in t -const i tuent  s t ructure  grammars ,  that  i s ,  i f  ru les

or

no  equ iva lence  c lass i f i ca t ion  o f  subst r in~ i s  obv ious  and  no  t ree  
can  be  drawn wi thout  fu r ther  assumpt ions .  
The  most  natura l  wou ld  be  to  draw a graph o f  the  fo l -

Unl ike  p -markers ,  th i s  g raph  at t r ibutes  one  and  the  same

ent  a l so  when these  h igher  const i tuents  a re  d i s jo in t .  Here  abc  
be longs  to  d and  to  e,  to  k and  to  i .  
I t  i s  by  no  means  an  unnatura l  descr ip t ion  of  a sentence  
to  le t  one  segment  have  more  than  one  funct ion ,  nor  i s  i t  im-  
pract i ca l  to  represent  such  s t ructures  as  graphs .  On  the  cont -  
ra ry ,  that  i s  what  graphs  are  fo r ,  and  in  the  spec ia l  case  where  
no  two branches  ever  coa lesce ,  the  graph seems to  be  so  u t ter ly  
s imple  that  i t  i s ,  a t  any  ra te ,  ra ther  a waste  of  paper  to  pr in t  
d rawings  o f  i t .  
For  a subset  o f  the  grammars  now under  d i scuss ion  we 
can ,  w i th  some good w i l l ,  const ruct  p -markers ,  a l though the  
same ru les  conta in  more  than  a s ing le  r ight  handed e lement .

Nobody seems to be over -happy  wi th  th is  a t tempt  to 
"add conditions to guarantee that a p -marker  for a terminal 
string can be recovered uniquely f rom its derivation" and for 
this and more  serious reasons linguists turn away  f rom these 
types of constituent g rammars  altogether. But it is character- 
istic that one attempts to find "unique" equivalence classifica- 
tions, i.e., tree graphs of the simple kind described. "We 
assume that such a tree graph must  be a part of the structu- 
ral description of any sentence; we  refer to it as a phrase- 
marker  p -marker .  A grammar  must  for adequacy  provide a 
p -marker  for each sentence". ~ In other words, rather than 
modi fy  the kind of graph employed, one replaces it, in trans- 
formational g rammar ,  by an ordered set of such simple graphs. 
The  multi- index notation permits  an alternative mode of 
presentation, as will appear in the next few paragraphs.

We now consider the case where  a grammar  G = < S, i~, I, T>

In particular, We consider the set S of vectors over a

We see that segmentat ion  is over lapp ing but that each 
level of: indexes represents  one equivalence c lass i f i ca t ion  and 
one t ree -shape  graph.  
In many cases ,  context - f ree  mul t i - index  ru les  are  
weakly  equivalent  to context -sens i t ive  ru les ,  as  Will appear  
f rom the fol lowing few examples  of languages  which notor ious -  
ly cannot be descr ibed  with o rd inary  context - f ree  ru les .  Crude-  
ly, we may say  that taking an index on another  level  into ac- 
count is  an impl ic i t  way of regard ing  context.

and  to prov ide  a means  of  represent ing  p -markers .

In a transformational g rammar ,  we  interpret G"  as a 
grammar  component, adding to our g rammar  a component  
G' -- < S l, R I, I i, T '>  where  1 I- is the set T" of p-markers, 
T i is a subset thereof and R ! is a set of multi- index re- 
writing rules such as 
alx ~ a'y 
atx bly ~ clx 
a~x alx bly ~ a!x bly alx bty 
a tx .  bly ~ b ly .  alx 
for specified sets of values for x, y, etc., that is, substi- 
tution, reduction, expansion and permutation rules for which 
the conditions are not confined to one index level at a time. 
Regard ing the analysis as a syntactic tree, we  may 
characterize transformational rules as such where  the con- 
ditions for some symbol(s) to be rewritten in a specified way  
refer to the "vertical" neighbours (not to the "horizontal" 
neighbours as in context-sensitive rules). We might  speak 
about pretext and posttext sensitive rules, or generally 
about "kintext sensitive" rules: Obviously and notoriously, 
"kintext" must  play a different role in generative and in 
recognition procedures, since pretext in one case is post- 
text in another. 
Thus, one component  may map the input strings on 
T" = \[ ti lxl ti 6 T ;  x 6 S"\ ]  and ~a transforma-tion compo-  
nent may map I I. = T" on T' = \ [ t ly l t  6A \ ]  and 
y ={a!l az la31 ...la i 6B  } where  B is a subset of S" and 
A___C T .  Or  we may def ine  the  ta rget  set  fo r  each  component 
in other ways.

Mult i - index ca lcu lus  in a t rans format iona l  g rammar  
Given a const i tuent  s t ruc ture  grammar  G = < S, R, I, T> 
we obtain an infinite grammar  G" by rep lac ing  S by 
S" = SU { s I Is2 ts3,  . . . \ [  s iES" \ ]  and R by 
g"  = \ [a ,az . . .  a n ~ b ' (a ,aZ . . ,  an) l (a ,az . - -  a n ~ b)  eR\] 
if K is  context - f ree  and o therwise  
R"= \ [a laz . . .a  n ~ b,' (a iaz . . .an) 'b  z '  (a iaz . . .a  n ) . . . .  " bm'  
(a laz . . :  an)  \[ (a la2 . . .  a n ~ b lbz . . ,  bm)ER} 
and rep lac ing  T = { t 1, t z . . . . .  tk} by 
T" = {t i ' x \ [ t iETxES" \ ] .  
That is,  we obtain a grammar*  which maps  given s t r ings  on 
an inf inite set  which may be cons idered  as a set  of p -mar -  
kers  ~. G" is then an in terpretat ion  grammar ,  cor respond ing  
to G.

a decidable one, see p. i3 above, footnote.  The 
number  of leve ls  does increase ,  but all ru les  re fer

These  mul t i - index  express ions  natura l ly  contain all 
in fo rmat ion  that t rans format ions  operate  upon.  Indeed, 
they wi l l  often contain too much,  but super f luous  in- 
dexes  can eas i ly  be e l iminated by mul t i - index  ru les ;  
the point is that no side condit ions for  permiss ib le  
t rans format iona l  rewr i t ings  need be observed .  Every -  
thing needed for  the ca lcu lus  is  in the s t r ing .

Thus,  one-level reduction rules suffice for a decision 
grammar  for a constituent-structure language and multi- index 
reduction rules suffice for an interpretation grammar  for such 
languages. Multi- index rules also suffice for a decision gram-  
mar  for a transformationally defined language. ~ The  question 
remains  if they suffice for an interpretation grammar  for the 
l a t te r .  
A structural description of the sentence may be given 
as the sequence of p -markers  obtained during the analysis. 
Now,  since the relative order of operations is not inherently 
fixed, we  would like to find a representation of such sequen- 
ces such that equivalence can easily,be defined. That is, we  
want  to f ind an adequate  in terpreta t ive  grammar  cor respond-  
ing to G I . Can mul t i - index  ru les  serve  those  purposes  ? 
The un i f ied  fo rmal i za t ion ,  p rov ided  by the mul t i - index  
representat ion ,  might  p rove  an a id  to f ind ing  an e f fec t ive  
interpretative ca lcu lus  for transformationally defined l angua-  
ges .  
Conclusion 
The mul t i - index  ca lcu lus  seems promis ing  for  severa l .  
l i ngu is t i c  purposes ,  espec ia l l y  where  res t r i c t ions  can be 
ass igned  to severa l ,  weak ly  in teract ing  leve ls .  
if this is decidable. They  may also, incidentally, 
provide simple decidability criteria for a transform- 
ational g rammar .  Cf. tile hints above (p. 13).
