Abstract
We show that existing methods for training
preposition error correction systems, whether
using well-edited text or error-annotated cor-
pora, do not generalize across very differ-
ent test sets. We present a new, large error-
annotated corpus and use it to train systems
that generalize across three different test sets,
each from a different domain and with differ-
ent error characteristics. This new corpus is
automatically extracted from Wikipedia revi-
sions and contains over one million instances
of preposition corrections.
1 Introduction
One of the main themes that has defined the field of
automatic grammatical error correction has been the
availability of error-annotated learner data to train
and test a system. Some errors, such as determiner-
noun number agreement, are easily corrected us-
ing rules and regular expressions (Leacock et al,
2010). On the other hand, errors involving the usage
of prepositions and articles are influenced by sev-
eral factors including the local context, the prior dis-
course and semantics. These errors are better han-
dled by statistical models which potentially require
millions of training examples.
Most statistical approaches to grammatical error
correction have used one of the following training
paradigms: 1) training solely on examples of cor-
rect usage (Han et al, 2006); 2) training on exam-
ples of correct usage and artificially generated er-
rors (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010); and 3) training
on examples of correct usage and real learner er-
rors (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Dale et al, 2012).
The latter two methods require annotated corpora of
errors, and while they have shown great promise,
manually annotating grammatical errors in a large
enough corpus of learner writing is often a costly
and time-consuming endeavor.
In order to efficiently and automatically acquire a
very large corpus of annotated learner errors, we in-
vestigate the use of error corrections extracted from
Wikipedia revision history. While Wikipedia re-
vision history has shown promise for other NLP
tasks including paraphrase generation (Max and
Wisniewski, 2010; Nelken and Yamangil, 2008) and
spelling correction (Zesch, 2012), this resource has
not been used for the task of grammatical error cor-
rection.
To evaluate the usefulness of Wikipedia revision
history for grammatical error correction, we address
the task of correcting errors in preposition selection
(i.e., where the context licenses the use of a prepo-
sition, but the writer selects the wrong one). We
first train a model directly on instances of correct
and incorrect preposition usage extracted from the
Wikipedia revision data. We also generate artificial
errors using the confusion distributions derived from
this data. We compare both of these approaches to
models trained on well-edited text and evaluate each
on three test sets with a range of different character-
istics. Each training paradigm is applied to multiple
data sources for comparison. With these multiple
evaluations, we address the following research ques-
tions:
1. Across multiple test sets, which data source
507
is more useful for correcting preposition er-
rors: a large amount of well-edited text, a large
amount of potentially noisy error-annotated
data (either artificially generated or automati-
cally extracted) or a smaller amount of higher
quality error-annotated data?
2. Given error-annotated data, is it better to train
on the corrections directly or to use the con-
fusion distributions derived from these correc-
tions for generating artificial errors in well-
edited text?
3. What is the impact of having a mismatch in the
error distributions of the training and test sets?
2 Related Work
In this section, we only review work in preposi-
tion error correction in terms of the three training
paradigms and refer the reader to Leacock et al
(2010) for a more comprehensive review of the field.
2.1 Training on Well-Edited Text
Early approaches to error detection and correction
did not have access to large amounts of error-
annotated data to train statistical models and thus,
systems were trained on millions of well-edited ex-
amples from news text instead (Gamon et al, 2008;
Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; De Felice and Pul-
man, 2009). Feature sets usually consisted of n-
grams around the preposition, POS sequences, syn-
tactic features and semantic information. Since the
model only had knowledge of correct usage, an error
was flagged if the system?s prediction for a particu-
lar preposition context differed from the preposition
the writer used.
2.2 Artificial Errors
The issue with training solely on correct usage was
that the systems had no knowledge of typical learner
errors. Ideally, a system would be trained on ex-
amples of correct and incorrect usage, however, for
many years, such error-annotated corpora were not
available. Instead, several researchers generated ar-
tificial errors based on the error distributions derived
from the error-annotated learner corpora available at
the time. Izumi et al (2003) was the first to evaluate
a model trained on incorrect usage as well as artifi-
cial errors for the task of correcting several different
error types, including prepositions. However, with
limited training data, system performance was quite
poor. Rozovskaya and Roth (2010) evaluated dif-
ferent ways of generating artificial errors and found
that a system trained on artificial errors could outper-
form the more traditional training paradigm of using
only well-edited texts. Most recently, Imamura et al
(2012) showed that performance could be improved
by training a model on artificial errors and address-
ing domain adaptation for the task of Japanese par-
ticle correction.
2.3 Error-Annotated Learner Corpora
Recently, error-annotated learner data has become
more readily and publicly available allowing models
to be trained on both examples of correct usage as
well typical learner errors. Han et al (2010) showed
that a preposition error detection and correction sys-
tem trained on 100,000 annotated preposition errors
from the Chungdahm Corpus of Korean Learner En-
glish (in addition to 1 million examples of correct
usage) outperformed a model trained only on 5 mil-
lion examples of correct usage. Gamon (2010) and
Dahlmeier and Ng (2011) showed that combining
models trained separately on examples of correct
and incorrect usage could also improve the perfor-
mance of a preposition error correction system.
3 Mining Wikipedia Revisions for
Grammatical Error Corrections
3.1 Related Work
Many NLP researchers have taken advantage of the
wealth of information available in Wikipedia revi-
sions. Dutrey et al (2011) define a typology of mod-
ifications found in the French Wikipedia (WiCo-
PaCo). They show that the kinds of edits made range
from specific lexical changes to more general rewrite
edits. Similar types of edits are found in the En-
glish Wikipedia. The data extracted from Wikipedia
revisions has been used for a wide variety of tasks
including spelling correction (Max and Wisniewski,
2010; Zesch, 2012), lexical error detection (Nelken
and Yamangil, 2008), sentence compression (Ya-
mangil and Nelken, 2008), paraphrase generation
(Max and Wisniewski, 2010; Nelken and Yamangil,
2008), lexical simplification (Yatskar et al, 2010)
and entailment (Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010;

Cabrio et al, 2012). To our knowledge, no one has
previously extracted data for training a grammatical
error detection system from Wikipedia revisions.
3.2 Extracting Preposition Correction Data
from Wikipedia Revisions
As the source of our Wikipedia revisions, we used an
XML snapshot of Wikipedia generated in July 2011
containing 8,735,890 articles and 288,583,063 revi-
sions.1 We then used the following process to ex-
tract preposition errors and their corresponding cor-
rections from this snapshot:
Step 1: Extract the plain text versions of all revi-
sions of all articles using the Java Wikipedia
Library (Ferschke et al, 2011).
Step 2: For each Wikipedia article, compare each
revision with the revision immediately preced-
ing it using an efficient diff algorithm.2
Step 3: Compute all 1-word edit chains for the arti-
cle, i.e., sequences of related edits derived from
all revisions of the same article. For example,
say revision 10 of an article inserts the preposi-
tion of into a sentence and revision 12 changes
that preposition to on. Assuming that no other
revisions change this sentence, the correspond-
ing edit chain would contain the following 3 el-
ements: ?of?on. The extracted chains con-
tain the full context on either side of the 1-word
edit, up to the automatically detected sentence
boundaries.
Step 4: (a) Ignore any circular chains, i.e., where
the first element in the edit chain is the same as
the last element. (b) Collapse all non-circular
1http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/
2http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/
chains, i.e., only retain the first and the last ele-
ments in a chain. Both these decisions are mo-
tivated by the assumption that the intermediate
links in the chain are unreliable for training an
error correction system since a Wikipedia con-
tributor modified them.
Step 5 : From all remaining 2-element chains, find
those where a preposition is replaced with an-
other preposition. If the preposition edit is the
only edit in the sentence, we convert the chain
into a sentence pair and label it clean. If there
are other 1-word edits but not within 5 words of
the preposition edit on either side, we label the
sentence somewhat clean. Otherwise, we label
it dirty. The motivation is that the presence of
other nearby edits make the preposition correc-
tion less reliable when used in isolation, due to
the possible dependencies between corrections.
All extracted sentences were part-of-speech tagged
using the Stanford Tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003).
Using the above process, we are able to extract ap-
proximately 2 million sentences containing preposi-
tions errors and their corrections. Some examples
of the sentences we extracted are given in Figure 1.
Example (4) shows an example of a bad correction.
4 Corpora
We use several corpora for training and testing our
preposition error correction system. The proper-
ties of each are outlined in Table 1, organized by
paradigm. For each corpus we report the total num-
ber of prepositions used for training, as well as the
number and percentage of preposition corrections.
4.1 Well-edited Text
We train our system on two well-edited corpora.
The first is the same corpus used by Tetreault and

and 12 of the MetaMetrics Lexile Corpus. Our sec-
ond corpus is a random sample of 10 million sen-
tences containing at least one preposition from the
June 2012 snapshot of English Wikipedia Articles.4
4.2 Artificially Generated Errors
Similar to Foster and Andersen (2009) and Ro-
zovskaya and Roth (2010), we artificially introduce
preposition errors into well-edited corpora (the two
described above). We do this based on a distribu-
tion of possible confusions and train a model that
is aware of the corrections. The two sets of con-
fusion distributions we used were derived based on
the errors extracted from Wikipedia revisions and
Lang-8 respectively (discussed in Section 4.3). For
each corrected preposition pi in the revision data,
we calculated P (pi|pj), where pj is each of the pos-
sible original prepositions that were confused with
pi. Then, for each sentence in the well-edited text,
all prepositions are extracted. A preposition is ran-
domly selected (without replacement) and changed
based on the distribution of possible confusions
(note that the original preposition is also included
in the distribution, usually with a high probabil-

tic Data Consortium (catalog number LDC93T3A).

edited text, since we assume that more recent versions of the
text will be most grammatical, and therefore closer to well-
edited.
ity, meaning that there is a strong preference not to
change the preposition). If a preposition is changed
to something other than the original preposition, all
remaining prepositions in the sentence are left un-
changed.
4.3 Naturally Occurring Errors
We have a number of corpora that contain annotated
preposition errors. Note that we are only considering
incorrectly selected prepositions, we do not consider
missing or extraneous.
NUCLE The NUS Corpus of Learner English (NU-
CLE)5 contains one million words of learner
essay text, manually annotated with error tags
and corrections. We use the same training, dev
and test splits as Dahlmeier and Ng (2011).
FCE The CLC FCE Dataset6 is a collection of
1,244 exam scripts written by learners of En-
glish as part of the Cambridge ESOL First Cer-
tificate in English (Yannakoudakis et al, 2011).
It includes demographic metadata about the
candidate, a grade for each essay and manually-
annotated error corrections.
Wikipedia We use three versions of the preposi-
tion errors extracted from the Wikipedia revi-
sions as described in Section 3.2. The first in-
cludes corrections where the preposition was
the only word corrected in the entire sentence

(clean). The second contains all clean cor-
rections, as well as all corrections where there
were no other edits within a five-word span on
either side of the preposition (?clean). The
third contains all corrections regardless of any
other changes in the surrounding context (all).
Lang-8 The Lang-8 website contains journals writ-
ten by language learners, where native speakers
highlight and correct errors on a sentence-by-
sentence basis. As a result, it contains typical
grammatical mistakes made by language learn-
ers, which can be easily downloaded. We auto-
matically extract 75,622 sentences with prepo-
sition errors and corrections from the first mil-
lion journal entries.7
HOO 2011 We take the test set from the HOO 2011
shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011) and ex-
tract all examples of preposition selection er-
rors. The texts are fragments of ACL papers
that have been manually annotated for gram-
matical errors.8
It is important to note that the three test sets we use
are from entirely different domains: exam scripts
from non-native English speakers (FCE), essays by
highly proficient college students in Singapore (NU-
CLE) and ACL papers (HOO). In addition, they have
a different number of total prepositions as well as er-
roneous prepositions.
5 Preposition Error Correction
Experiments
We use the preposition error correction model de-
scribed in Tetreault and Chodorow (2008)9 to eval-
uate the many ways of using Wikipedia error cor-
rections as described in the Section 4. We use this
system since it has been recreated for other work
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Tetreault et al, 2010) and
is similar in methodology to Gamon et al (2008)
7Tajiri et al (2012) extract a corpus of English verb phrases
corrected for tense/aspect errors from Lang-8. They kindly pro-
vided us with their scripts to carry out the scraping of Lang-8.
8The results of the HOO 2011 shared task were not reported
at level of preposition selection error, therefore it is not possible
to compare the results presented in this paper with those results.
9Note that in that work, the model was evaluated in terms of
preposition error detection rather than correction, however the
model itself does not change.
and De Felice and Pulman (2009). In short, the
method models the problem of preposition error cor-
rection (for replacement errors) as a 36-way classifi-
cation problem using a multinomial logistic regres-
sion model.10 The system uses 25 lexical, syntac-
tic and n-gram features derived from the contexts of
each preposition training instance.
We modified the training paradigm of Tetreault
and Chodorow (2008) so that a model could be
trained on examples of correct usage as well as ac-
tual errors. We did this by adding a new feature
specifying the writer?s original preposition (as in
Han et al (2010) and Dahlmeier and Ng (2011)).
5.1 Results
We train a preposition correction system using each
of the three data paradigms and test on the FCE,
NUCLE and HOO 2011 test corpora. For each
preposition in the test corpus, we record whether
the system predicted that it should be changed,
and if so, what it should be changed to. We then
compare the prediction to the annotation in the test
corpus. We report results in terms of f-score, where
precision and recall are calculated as follows:11
Precision = Number of correct preposition correctionsTotal number of corrections suggested
Recall = Number of correct preposition correctionsTotal number of corrections in test set
Note that due to the high volume of unchanged
prepositions in the test corpus, we obtain very high
accuracies, which are not indicative of true perfor-
mance, and are not included in our results.
The results of our experiments are presented in
Table 2.12 The first part of the table shows the f-
scores of preposition error correction systems that
10We use liblinear (Fan et al, 2008) with the L1-regularized
logistic regression solver and default parameters.
11As Chodorow et al (2012) note, it is not clear how to han-
dle cases where the system predicts a preposition that is neither
the same as the writer preposition nor the correct preposition.
We count these cases as false positives.
12No thresholds were used in the systems that were trained
on well-edited text. Traditionally, thresholds are applied so as
to only predict a correction when the system is highly confident.
This has the effect of increasing precision at the cost of recall,
and sometimes leads to an overall improved f-score. Here we
take the prediction of the system, regardless of the confidence,
reflecting a lower-bound of this method.

one might be able to train with publicly available
data excluding the Wikipedia revisions that we have
extracted. We refer to these systems as nonWikiRev
systems. The second part of the table shows the f-
scores of systems trained on the Wikipedia revisions
data ? either directly on the annotated errors or on
the artificial errors produced using the confusion dis-
tributions derived from these annotated errors. We
refer to this second set of systems as WikiRev sys-
tems. The nonWikiRev systems perform inconsis-
tently, heavily dependent on the characteristics of
the test set in question. On the other hand, it is
obvious that the WikiRev systems ? while not al-
ways outperforming the best nonWikiRev systems
? generalize much better across the three test sets.
In fact, for the NUCLE test set, the best WikiRev
system performs as well as the nonWikiRev system
trained on data from the same domain and with iden-
tical error characteristics as the test set. The distri-
butions of errors in the three test sets are not sim-
ilar, and therefore, the stability in performance of
the WikiRev systems cannot be attributed to the hy-
pothesis that the WikiRev training data error distri-
butions are more similar to the test data than any of
the other training corpora. Therefore, we claim that
if a preposition error correction system is to be de-
ployed on data for which the error characteristics are
not known in advance, i.e. most real-world scenar-
ios, training the system using Wikipedia revisions is
likely to be the most robust option.
6 Discussion
We examine the results of our experiments in light
of the research questions we posed in Section 1.
6.1 Which Data Source is More Useful?
We wanted to know whether it was better to have
a smaller corpus of carefully annotated corrections,
or a much larger (but automatically generated, and
therefore noisier) error-annotated corpus. We also
wanted to compare this scenario to training on large
amounts of well-edited text. From our experiments,
it is clear that the composition of the test set plays
a major role in answering this question. On a test
set with few corrections (NUCLE), training on well-
edited text (and without using thresholds) performs
particularly poorly. On the other hand, when eval-
uating on the FCE test set which contains far more
errors, training on well-edited text performs reason-
ably well (though statistically significantly worse
than training on all of the Wikipedia errors). Sim-
ilarly, training on the smaller, high-quality NU-
CLE corpus and evaluating on the NUCLE test set
achieves good results, however training on NUCLE
and testing on FCE achieves the lowest f-score of all
our systems on that test set.
Figure 2 shows the learning curves obtained by
increasing the size of the training data for two
of the test sets.13 Although one might assume

Figure 2: The effect of varying the size of the training corpus
that Wikipedia-clean would be more reliable than
Wikipedia-all, the cleanness of the Wikipedia data
seems to make very little difference, probably be-
cause the data extracted in the dirty contexts is not
as noisy as we expected. Interestingly, it also seems
that additional data would lead to further improve-
ments for models trained on artificial errors in Lexile
data and for those trained on all of the automatically
extracted Wikipedia errors.
Another interesting aspect of Figure 2 is that
since we were sampling at specific data points which did not
correspond exactly to the total sizes of the training corpora.
training on the Lang-8 data shows a very steep rising
trend. This suggests that automatically-scraped data
that is highly targeted towards language learners is
very useful in correcting preposition errors in texts
where they are reasonably frequent.
6.2 Natural or Artificially Generated Errors?
Table 2 shows that training on artificially generated
errors via Wikipedia revisions performs fairly con-
sistently across test corpora. While using Lang-8
for artificial error generation is also quite promis-
ing for FCE, it does not generalize across test sets.

Figure 3: The effect of varying the percentage of errors in the training corpus
On FCE it achieves the highest results, on NUCLE
it performs statistically significantly worse than the
best system, and on HOO 2011 it achieves a lower
(though not statistically significant) result than the
best system. This highlights that extracting errors
from Wikipedia is useful in two ways: (1) training a
system on the errors alone works well and (2) gener-
ating artificial errors in well-edited corpora of differ-
ent domains and training a system on that also works
well. It also indicates that if the system were to be
applied to a specific domain, applying the confusion
distributions to a domain specific corpus ? if avail-
able ? would likely yield the best results.
6.3 Mismatching Distributions
The proportion of errors in the training and test data
plays an important role in the performance of any
preposition error correction system. This is clearly
evident by comparing system performances across
the three test sets which have fairly different compo-
sitions. FCE contains a much higher proportion of
errors than NUCLE, and HOO falls somewhere in
between. Interestingly, the system trained on Lang-
8 data (which contains the highest proportion of er-
514
rors among all training corpora) performs best on
the FCE data. On the other hand, the same sys-
tem performs poorly on NUCLE test which contains
far fewer errors. In this instance, the system learns
to predict an incorrect preposition too often. We
see a similar pattern with the system trained on the
NUCLE training data. It performs poorly on FCE
which contains many errors, but well on NUCLE
test which contains a similar proportion of errors.
In order to better understand the relationship be-
tween the percentage of errors in the training data
and system performance, we vary the percentage of
errors in each training corpus from 1-50% and test
on the unchanged FCE and NUCLE test corpora.
For each training corpus, we reduce the size to be
twice the size of the total number of errors.14 Keep-
ing this size constant, we then artificially change the
percentage of errors. Note that because the total size
of the corpus has changed, the results in Table 2 may
not appear in the graph. Figure 3 shows the effect on
f-score when the data composition is changed. For
both test sets, there is a peak after which increas-
ing the proportion of errors in the training corpus is
detrimental. For NUCLE test with its low number
of preposition errors, this peak is very pronounced.
For FCE, it is more of a gentle degradation in per-
formance, but the pattern is clear. Also noteworthy
is the fact that the degradation for models trained on
artificial errors is less steep suggesting that they may
be more stable across test sets.
In general, these results indicate that when
building a preposition error detection using error-
annotated data, the characteristics of the data to
which the system will be applied should play a vital
role in how the system is to be trained. Our results
show that the WikiRev systems are robust across
test sets, however if the exact distribution of errors
in the data is known in advance, other models may
perform better.
7 Conclusion
Although previous approaches to preposition er-
ror correction using either well-edited text or small
hand-annotated corrections performed well on some
specific test set, they did not generalize well across
14We omit the NUCLE train corpus from this comparison,
because it contains too few errors to obtain a meaningful result.
very different test sets. In this paper, we present
work that automatically extracts preposition error
corrections from Wikipedia Revisions and uses it
to build robust error correction systems. We show
that this data is useful for two purposes. Firstly, a
model trained directly on the corrections performs
well across test sets. Secondly, models trained on ar-
tificial errors generated from the distribution of con-
fusions in the Wikipedia data perform equally well.
The distribution of confusions can also be applied to
other well-edited corpora in different domains, pro-
viding a very powerful method of automatically gen-
erating error corpora. The results of our experiments
also highlight the importance of the distribution of
expected errors in the test set. Models that perform
well on one kind of distribution may not necessar-
ily work on a completely different one, as evident
in the performances of the systems trained on either
Lang-8 or NUCLE. In general, the WikiRev mod-
els perform well across distributions. We also con-
ducted some preliminary system combination exper-
iments and found that while they yielded promising
results, further investigation is necessary. We have
also made the Wikipedia preposition correction cor-
pus available for download.15
In future work, we will examine whether the
results we obtain for English generalize to other
Wikipedia languages. We also plan to extract multi-
word corrections for other types of errors and to ex-
amine the usefulness of including error contexts in
our confusion distributions (e.g., preposition confu-
sions following verbs versus those following nouns).
