It is difficult to deter,nine the tmrameter values 
directly front the natural  language descriptions. 
beeattse of the I)artiality of the information and 
tim vagueness about the sttatial rehttions alnollg 
tile entities. So. at first, we extract such informa- 
tion as the qual itat ive spatial  constraints among 
the spatial attr ibutes of the entities, and then. 
interpret hese COllstrailltS alld calcuhtte the t>a: 
ranleter values. This process is shown in figure 1. 
Given ~ text, SPR INT  makes a sm'faee ease 
structure using the lexical information. Each en- 
t ity is described ms a noltlt. Next, SPR INT  ex- 
tracts spatial  constraints about the entit ies by 
analyzing the related words in the case. struc- 
ture. At this time. SPR INT  also extracts the 
sequence of the information references fl'om the 
lexical mtbrmation as dependencies, which are 
used as cues in the calculation of the paranw- 
ters. 
At the next stage, the extracted qual i tat ive 
constraints are intertn'eted as the nmnerical  con- 
straints among the e,ltity paranletc.rs. These nu- 
l l lerical COllstrailltS :4re repl 'esented }kS the COlllbi- 
natiolt of the primit ive constraints. Tit(! tmten - 
tial energy function is one of such primitives, and 
this is an efficient method to treat the vagllelteSS 
in the constraints. Other primit ives are the tot m- 
logical constraints and the regions. The potent ia l  
energy flmction is a kind of the cost fllnetiolls 
which t~tkes all related paranmters and output  
the ('()st. The less the wthm of the potential  (m- 
ergy flmction, the more credit the combinatiml 
of the gemnetric parameters gains. Using the 
gradient descendent method, the solution with 
nl ininnnn cost is calculated. The t)otcntial (m- 
c.rgy flmction 1)rovides a means for accmnulat ing 
f l 'om fragnmntal'y infornuttion. (Tit(; bas ic  i(te~

Suptlose that the fi)llowing sentences are the in- 
puts to SPR INT .

~)5o j (There is a marine tOwl.r to tit(. right

Frmn these sentences, SPR INT  gets the sur- 
fttee eR.se str lwt l t res  a, ttd interprel, s each eOllltec- 
tion in tit(! structures to extr;u:t sp;ttial con-  
s t ra ints .  Tit(; ext.racled constraints in this ex- 
ample is shown in table 1. 
Then SPR INT  calculates the entity parame- 
ter vahles based Oll these COllstrailltS llSillg po- 
tential c.nergy flmctions. The exanq)le of the t)l)- 
tentiM energy fllllctioll is showlt ill figm'e 2. This 
is one which is used to calculate the location of 
the ship. In this figure, the line repre.sents the 
edge of the park. and the thither side of the line 
me;ms the inside of the t)ark. Finally SPR INT  
draw a world image (m the graphic display. This 
is shown in figure 3.

means put it between the p()int of the observer

5 Re la ted  Work  
From the lmrc l inguistic point of view, A. Her- 
skovits \[1\] analyzed locativ(~ expr(~ssi(ms in En- 
glish. As for constructing a ('Oml)uter model, 
conventional logic fMls short of ore" tmrpose. 
Anlong the formulations based Imrely on C()llVell- 
t ioual logic, n,ost, t,ypical is slot-til ler et)resen~a- 
|,ion such as a tbrmulal:ion by Gordon Nowtk ,It" 
\[2\]. Tlmre also is a work |,y D. Waltz\[3\]. i1 is 
however hlu'd to draw logical c(mchmion out. of a 
set of axioms which ll iay involve predicates vague 
and to get a reusable model of the world toni|g- 
unction. 
Ore' apln'oach allows both cont, ii luous and dis-

stxMnts, so that the prot)abil ity changes eit:lwr 
contimumsly and discontilmously. 
It Mso works as ~t clmnk of the information. 
Though it seems that our aptn'oach is rathm' sub- 
jective, it seems imtiossil)le to construct a model 
for the worhl without smnc kind of subjective.
