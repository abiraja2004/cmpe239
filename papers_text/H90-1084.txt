Carnegie Mellon University is engaged in a broad 
program of research whose goal is to provide the 
knowledge, currently missing, that will allow us to effec- 
tively integrate speech into the computer interface. We 
have identified a number of areas that we believe are of 
crucial importance to the acceptance of speech as a stan- 
dard modality of human-computer communication. Our 
separate r search areas are united by the common theme of 
eliminating the fundamental limitations of current speech 
recognition technology. We are currently working in the 
following areas: 
? Improved Recogn i t ion  Techn iques  - -  We are 
beginning the development of a 5000-word, speaker 
independent, connected speech recognition system. 
To maintain high accuracy on these larger tasks, we 
are pursuing anumber of different strategies. We are 
investigating better subword models, improved 
learning algorithms, and rapid configuration for new 
vocabularies and tasks. We are also collecting a large 
database of task-independent speech and investigating 
more efficient ways of handling larger amounts of 
training data. 
? F luent  Human/Mach ine  In ter faces  - -  We are 
investigating the utility of speech in several 
day-to-day interactive tasks. We have developed an 
effective interface for complex problem-solving 
applications using spoken language, and implemented 
a real-time spoken-language system for the Office 
Manager (OM) system. We have also developed 
strategies that will allow users to dynamically modify 
tasks by adding new words and grammatical 
constructs. Our plans include extending the OM 
system and deploying it within the group to study 
spoken-language interaction for meaningful daily 
tasks like mail, management, appointment scheduling, 
and personal database manipulation. 
* Acoust i ca l  and  Env i ronmenta l  Robustness  - -  We 
have recently developed algorithms that deal with 
several classes of variability in the speech signal, 
including noise-subtraction algorithms based on 
traditional approaches that substantially eliminate 
stationary noise interference. More recently, we have 
developed techniques that allow us to approach 
comparable r cognition performance from a variety of 
microphones, including table-top microphones, 
without he need to specifically train for each 
microphone. This latter esult has brought us close to 
microphone independence. 
? Unders tand ing  Spontaneous  Spoken Language - -  
Moving beyond small languages and rigid syntax, 
situations in which the user cannot (or will not) learn 
a restricted command language, requires the use of 
sophisticated parsing techniques that can deal with 
ill-formed speech. M-formedness can be 
mispronunciation, agrammaticality, he presence of 
restarts, as well as more mundane phenomena such as 
interjections (um's and ah's) and pauses. We have 
developed a frame-based parsing approach that has 
been remarkably successful inparsing ill-formed 
input and in dealing with a variety of common 
natural-language phenomena such as anaphora nd 
ellipsis. We have successfully integrated this parser 
into ATIS, the Air Travel Information System, and 
OM, the Office Manager system. 
? Dialog Modeling - -  Real-world tasks have numerous 
constraints that allow us to predict successfully the 
course of an interaction. We have been extending the 
work begun with the MINDS system to additional 
domains and have successfully demonstrated that 
similar dialog-level constraints can be applied to 
recognition. We are currently focusing on the ATIS 
domain to develop dialog models which have the 
potential to reduce perplexity by an order of 
magnitude.
