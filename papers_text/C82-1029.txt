The work we describe here is a prel iminary study concerning 
the automatic translation of natura l language statements 
into the RESEDA semantic metalanguage. A first stage of the 
procedure consists in marking the "triggers", defined as 
lexical units which call upon one  or more of the predicative 
patterns al lowed for in the metalanquage. The predicative 
patterns obtained are then merged, and their case slots 
fil led with the elements found in surface structure according 
to the predict ions associated with the slots. 
INTRODUCTION 
1 The work that we intend to present here is a prel iminary study concerning the 
automatic translation of natural language statements - which describe the 
biographies of historical personages taken into account by the RESEDA system - 
into the RESEDA semantic metalanguage. 
The RESEDA project itself concerns the creation and practical exploitation of a 
database containing the biographies of historical personages of the late Middle 
Ages in France. The most important characteristic of the system'l ies in the 
possibi l i ty of using inference procedures to question the database about causal 
relationships which may exist between the different recorded facts, and which 
are not expl icit ly declared at the time of data entry (Zarri 1979, 1981)'.

THE RESEDA METALANGUAGE 
The biographical information which constitutes the system's database is organized 
in the form of units called "planes". There are several different types of plane ; 
the "predicative planes", the most important, correspond to a "flash" which illus- 
trates a particular moment in the "life story" of one or more personages. A 
predicative plane is made up of one of five possible "predicates" (BE-AFFECTED-BY, 
BEHAVE, BE-PRESENT, MOVE, PRODUCE) ; to each predicate, one or more "modulators" 
may be attached. The modulator's function is to specify and delimit the semantic 
role of the predicate. Each predicate is accompanied by "case slots" which 
introduce the predicative arguments ; dating and space location is also given 
within a predicative plane, as is the bibl iographic authority for the statement. 
Predicative planes can be linked together in a number of ways ; one way is to use 
explicit links of "coordination", "alternative", "causality", "finality", "condi- 
tion", etc. (Zarri et al 1977). 
For example, the data "Andr4 Marchant was named provost of paris by the King's 
Council on 22nd September 1413 ; he lost his post on 23rd October 1414, to the 
benefit of Tanguy du Ch~tel, who was granted this office", will be represented in 
three planes - that of the nomination of Andr~ Marchant, his dismissal and the 
nomination of Tanguy du Ch~tel. The coding of information must be made on two 
distinct levels: an "external" coding, realized manual ly by the analyst, gives 
rise to a first type of representation, formalized according to the categories of 
the RESEDA metalanguage ; a second automatic step results in the "internal" 
numeric code. The external "manual" coding of the three events just stated will 
be the following: 
I) begin+soc+BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ Andr~-Marchant 
OBJ provost : Paris 
SOURCE king's-council  
datel : 22-september-1413 
date2 : 
bibl: Demurgerl,273 
2) end+BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ Andr~-Marchant 
OBJ provost : Paris 
datel : 23-october-1414 
date2 : 
bibl: Demurgerl,273 
3) begin+BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ Tanguy-du-Ch~tel 
OBJ provost : Paris 
datel : 23-october-1414 
date2 : 
bibl: Demurgerl,273 
The code in capital letters indicates a predicate and its associated "case slots". 
Every predicative plane is characterized by a pair of "time references" (datel- 
date2) which give the duration of the episode in question. In these three planes, 
the second date slot (date2) is empty, because their modulators (begin, end) 
specify a change of state associated with a punctual event."Andr~-Marchant" and 
"Tanguy-du-Ch~tel" are historical personages known to the system ; "provost", 
"king's-Council" and "letters-of-nomination" are terms of RESEDA's lexicon. The 
classif ications associated with terms of the lexicon provide the major part of 
the system's socio-historical knowledge of the period. "Paris" is the "location 
of the object". If the historical sources analysed gave us the exact causes of 
these events, we would introduce into the database the corresponding planes and 
associate them with these three planes by an explicit link of type "CAUSE".

DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED 
In the field of the application of Artif icial Intell igence techniques to natural 
language processing, from the very beginning, stress was put on the importance of 
semantic and pragmatic components. In this framework, creating a formal represen- 
tation of the message carried by a surface expression is usual ly achieved by one 
of two methods. 
The first, and most traditional, respects the usual progression of the three 
levels of analysis, morphological, syntactic and semantic whilst combining their 
results in a final interpretation : for discussion, see for example Winograd 
(1972), Woods (1973), Marcus (1979), etc. 
Schank and Wilks, on the contrary, put forward the idea, which was subsequently 
taken up by many researchers, that a predominantly semantic analysis, with syntax 
relegated to a secondary role, was possible. The deep structure representation 
that is being created is thus used to make appropriate predict ions about the 
logico-semantic function of the elements ; these expectations are progressively 
met during the examination of the surface structure representation, see Schank 
(1975), Wilks (1975), etc. 
-The hypothesis adopted for our project draws more from this second method, in 
that the structures of RESEDA's internal representation provide, beforehand, a 
very complete framework of the predictions which are to be a guide in scanning 
the text to be translated into the system's metalanguage. 
To describe our approach, we will uti l ize theabove  example. The initial text in 
natural language is first (pre)processed to obtain its constituent structure. For 
this purpose, we have used the French surface grammar implemented in DEREDEC, a 
software package developed at the University of Quebec at Montreal by Pierre 
Plante (1980a, 1980b). This system, comparable to an ATN parser, permits a break- 
down of the surface text into its syntactic constituents, and establishes, between 
these constituents, syntagmatic relationships of the type topic-comment, determi- 
nation and coordination. This prel iminary analysis provide a context for subse- 
c t processing, without necessari ly removing all the ambiguities : in the same 
w . see Boguraev and Sparck Jones (1982). 
The ~pecific tools that we intend to develop for this project are of two types : 
a g~neral procedure which can be likened to a sort of semantic parsing, and a 
system of heuristic rules. 
Semantic parsing 
The first stage of the general procedure consists of marking the "triggers", 
defined as lexical units which call one or more of the predicative patterns 
allowed for in RESEDA's metalanguage. Thus we do not take into consideration every 
one of the lexical items met in thesur face  text, retaining only those directly 
pertaining to the "translation" to be done ; this is not without similarity with 
the "skimming" found in DeJong (1979a, 1979b). 
However, we do not limit ourselves to a simple keyword approach. Certain lexical 
items are potential triggers, but their actual triggering in a given context 
depends on rules using both the morpho-syntactic analysis provided by DEREDEC and 
the socio-historical knowledge stored in the RESEDA system. These rules intervene 
at this stage to decide whether triggering should take place and to choose the 
predicative patterns. In the sentence given, belong to the list of potential 
triggers the verbal forms : "named", "lost", "granted" ; terms pertaining directly 
to the metalanguage : "office", synonymous with <post> in RESEDA, and its speci- 
fication "provost" ; date elements : "september", "october". After applying the 
rules, the fol lowing patterns have been triggered :

was named begin+(soc+)BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ <personage>-surface subject of the 
trigger 
OBJ <post>-surface complement 
(SOURCE <personage>l<social-body>-sur- 
face complement of the agent of 
the trigger)

date2 : prohibited

date2 : optional 
bibl. : obligatory 
23 october 14~4 ~ date b 
was granted ~ begin+(soc+)BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ <personage>-surface subject of 
the trigger 
OBJ <post>-surface complement 
(SOURCE <personage>l<social-body>- 
complement of the surface agent) 
MODAL letters-of-nomination 
datel : obligatory 
date2 : prohibited 
bibl. : obligatory 
office ~ (SOc+)BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ <personage> 
W OBJ <post> 
(SOURCE <personage>l<social-body>) 
datel : obligatory 
date2 : optional 
bibl. : obligatory 
The second stage of this general procedure consists of examining the triggers be- 
longing to the same morpho-syntactic environment. If there are several predicate 
triggers in the same environment, and if the predicates triggered are the same 
- which means that the predicates and case slots must be the same and that the 
modulators, dates and the space location information must be compatible - then it 
can be said that the triggers refer to the same situation. As a result, the predi- 
cative patterns are merged as to obtain the most complete description possible ; 
the predictions about filling the slots linked with the cases of the resulting 
pa~terns, together govern the search for fillers in the surface expression. 
CONVERSION INTO THE RESEDA METALANGUAGE 187 
Thus, the first three tri@gers of the example, recognized as relevant to the same 
environment, are combined in the following formula : 
begin+(soc+)BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ <personage>-surface subject of "is named" 
OBJ <post>-"provost" 
(SOURCE <personage>I<soclal-body>-surface complement of 
the agent of "is named" 
datel : date a 
date2 : prohibited 
blbl. : obl igatory 
The units of the surface expression corresponding to the predictions of the pat- 
tern obtained are then retrieved and standardized according to RESEDA's cat- 
egories imposed by the pattern (Andr~ Marchant : Andr~-Marchant, personage ; 
provost : provost, post ; King's Council : king's-council, social-body, etc.). 
Eventually, we obtain pla~e 1 in Andr~ Marchant's biography. 
The example we have shown il lustrates a part icular ly simple case, in which it is 
not necessary to establish links between the planes created. If we had to process 
the sentence "Phil ibert de St L~ger is nominated seneschal of Lyon on the 30th of 
July 1412, in lieu of the late A. de Viry", three planes should be generated : 
one for the nomination of Phil ibert de St L~ger, one for the death of A. de Viry, 
and another one establishing a weak causality link ("CONFER", in our metalanguage) 
between the first two planes. Surface items such as conjunctions, preposit ions and 
sentential adverbs can be used to infer links between planes : causality, f inal- 
ity, coordination, etc. More precisely, in the last example, "in lieu of" is a 
potential trigger according to the following rule : if the main noun group of the 
surface preposit ional phrase contains a trigger, this phrase constitutes a plane 
environment and CONFER introduces the plane created. 
Heurist ic rules 
The process we have sketched so far requires a corpus of heuristic rules, to solve 
am~gui t les  which are left aside by the predict ion system - which cannot go beyond 
the 5apabil it ies of RESEDA's predicative patterns. 
We s:~ll say just a few words about the heuristic rules designed to solve cases 
of anaphora (as in our first example, "he", "this office", "who"). 
In the approach that we propose, marks of anaphora are identif ied during the gen- 
eral analysis procedure with unassumed predictions, tr iggering the appropriate 
heuristic rules. The actual solving, after val idation of the marks, brings into 
play a number of criteria from simple pair ing off and morphological agreement to 
more subtle criteria, like contextual proximity, persistance of theme, etc. Thus, 
morphological agreement and contextual proximity are used to replace "who" by 
"Tanguy du Ch~tel" in our first example ; persistance of theme enables us to make 
up for the missing date of Tanguy du Ch~tel's posting by date b in the list of 
triggers. 
We would like to integrate this approach, which has been purely empirical up to 
now, into the framework of a more general theory. Two directions of enquiry seem 
part icular ly interesting in order to develop our own phi losophy of the subject. 
The PAL system of Candace Sidner, is a top-down anaphora resolution method which 
makes use of the notion of focus (likened to the theme of the discourse). By 
searching in the text for "focuses" which refer to a system of representation 
organized as a series of "frames", it is able to solve references. If the refer- 
ence is not found by using the frames themselves, At is inferred from other 
frames contained in the database (Sidner 1978, 1979). 
188 J. LEON et al 
The interest for our study lies in the fact that RESEDA already has, as permanent 
data, a certain amount of general knowledge organized in a form very similar to 
that of frames. Thus, in Our example, the nomination and dismissal of Andr~ Mar- 
chant refers to the context of the "civil war at the beginning of the 15th cen- 
tury" which is one of those frames. 
The approach used by Klappholz and Lockman depends on the hypothesis that there is 
a strong link between coreference and the cohesive links of a discourse. These 
links, when marked progressively in the text, become the indices of a structure of 
the discourse, organized as a tree structure and created dynamical ly (Lockman 1978~ 
These cohesive links (effect, cause, syllogism, exemplif ication, etc.) are very 
similar to the logical connections between planes in RESEDA (causality, finality, 
condition, etc.). 
CONCLUSION 
The study that we describe here is intended to automatical ly attain a representa- 
tion of fundamental underlying semantic relationships corresponding to a French 
surface expression. These results can, in principle, be used not only in the 
framework of RESEDA, but in a number of different app!ications such as, for ex- 
ample, automatic abstraction, paraphrase, machine translation, direct encoding 
of natural language documents in a factual database.
