This paper presents the analyser for type-written Ital- 
ian sentences used in the LISA system. 
This system has been developed in ELSAG within the 
researches on Natt~rel Language Processing aimed at making the 
dialogue with the user easier and more graceful. 
The analyser was designed to accept input sentences 
without any constraint on how they are formed (e.g. in active 
or passive form, with a variable number and position of compl-  
ements, etc.), and to accept such irregularities as ellipsis, 
idioms and small grammatical errors. The present version works 
for simple sentences that are introduced one at a time. 
The output of the system is an internal conceptual re- 
presentation that we defined, according to Schank, "concept- 
ualization". It represents the meaning of the sentence in a 
non-ambiguous way and we can define it as an organized set of 
pred ioate~argument  l i s t s ,  each of  which can have some modi f -  
i e rs .  One feature  of the conceptua l i za t ion  format i s  i t s  
genera l i ty ,  which permits  to  eas i l y  adapt the system to any 
new application. 
The analyser makes use of a dictionary that includes a 
lexicon, a set of syntactic descriptions and a set of semantic 
descr ip t ions .

The lex icon ,  in  the vers ion  present ly  implemented, con-  
ta ins  about 2500 words that  permit  the user  to  in t roduce  
sentences  ( s ta tements  or  quest ions  or  answers) con ern ing  
people character i s t i cs  l i ke  age,  p ro fess ion ,  hea l th  and 
the i r  ac t ions  and re la t ions  wi th  the externa l  wor ld,  l i ke  to  
go, to  come, to  t rave l ,  to g ive ,  to  take (TRANSFER), to  know 
(~OrhEDGE), to  speak, to say (COm~JNICATION), to  own, to  
conta in  (RELATION), e tc .  The lex icon  i s  broken down in to  
severa l  sec t ions  in  o rder  to  opt imize  the memory usage aocord-  
ing  to  an exhaust ive  study of a root -end ing  representat ion  
of  i ta l ian  words. 
The syntact i c  descr ip t ions  are d i rec t ly  re la ted  to 
lex ioa l  ent r ies  and conta in  a t t r ibutes  l i ke  gender  and number 
of  the nouns or  l i ke  mood and tense  of  the verbs .  
The semant ic  descr ip t ions  represent  the conceptua l  
ent i t ies  re la ted  to  lex ioa l  ent r ies ;  they main ly  conta in  
in fo rmat ions  about the cons is tency  between pred icates  (named 
"operators" )  and the i r  a r~mente  and prov ide a c lass i f i ca t ion  
of  the conceptua l  ent i t ies .  
The ana lys i s  process  works in  th ree  main s teps :  the 
lex ica l  ana lys i s ,  a bottom-up reoo~l i t ion  of  "syntact i c  and 
semant ic  Groups" and a top-down inser t ion  of these  Groups in  
the  semantic  s t ruc ture  (conceptua l i za t ion) .  
The lex ica l  ana lys i s  recogn izes  the s ing le  words in  
the  input  s t r ing  and compares them with the lex icon  compon- 
ents  in  o rder  to  recover  e l l  poss ib le  in terpreta t ions .  The 
sequence of  the syntact i c  and semant ic  descr ip t ions  obta ined 
forms the output  of  th i s  s tep .  Unknown terms are neg lec ted  
at  th i s  po in t ,  but the d ia logue  oont ro l l ing  module i s  in form-  
ed about that .

The las t  s tep  of  the ana lys i s  re la tes  the e lements  in  
the prev ious ly  bu i l t  Groups wi th  the ro les  in  the conceptua l  
s t ruc ture  (conceptua l i za t ion) .  
This s t ruc ture  in  i t s  main peat ( "nuc leus" )  i s  determin -  
ed by the verbs  in  the Verb-Group; some other  ro les ,  su88ested 
by the "expectat ions"  in  the  Noun-Groups and in  the  Adverb- 
Groups can be assoc ia ted  to the nuc leus  through RELATION oper -  
a tors .  The main o r i te~on that  gu ides  the assoc ia t ion  between 
Groups ~d conceptua l i za t ion  ro les  i s  based on expectat ions

A semant ic  approach character i zes  th i s  method of  ana lys -  
i s :  in  fac t  a syntact i c  representat ion  of  the input  i s  not  
at tempted and the semantic descr ip t ions  of  concepts  are  d i rec t -  
l y  access ib le .  
This makes i t  eas ie r  to ~?de the ana lys i s  towards the 
in terna l  representat ion ,  at  the same time reduc in  8 the number 
of  the a l te rnat ives  generated  and consequent ly  a lso  the prob-  
lem of dea l ing  wi th  ambigu i t ies .  
A fu r ther  fundamental  feattLre i s  the co -operat ion  bet~ 
ween bottom-up and top-down techn iques  in  the organ izat ion  of  
the  input  in  Groups and in  the f i l l i ng  of  the output  s t ruc tu -  
re .  The f i r s t  o f  them i s  best  su i ted  to deal  w i th  grem~at ic~ 
dev ia t ions ,  incor rec t  in f le~ons  and f ragmentary  u t te r~uces ,  
a l so  because of  the mani fo ld  scanning and non r igorous  const r -  
a?nts on the word pos i t ions .  
At th i s  leve l  pattern-matc~Lng mechanisms can a l so  be 
used to handle id ioms and o thers  f i xed  phrases ;  the reco~Lt -  
ion  of  these  forms, may need both syntact i c  and semantic  de-  
sc r ip t ions .
