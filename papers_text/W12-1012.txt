Abstract
A significant amount of information about
Cultural Heritage artefacts is now available
in digital format and has been made avail-
able in digital libraries. Being able to iden-
tify items that are similar would be use-
ful for search and navigation through these
data sets. Information about items in these
repositories is often multimodal, such as
pictures of the artefact and an accompa-
nying textual description. This paper ex-
plores the use of information from these
various media for computing similarity be-
tween Cultural Heritage artefacts. Results
show that combining information from im-
ages and text produces better estimates of
similarity than when only a single medium
is considered.
1 Introduction and Motivation
In recent years a vast amount of Cultural Heritage
(CH) artefacts have been digitised and made avail-
able on-line. For example, the Louvre and the
British Museum provide information about ex-
hibits on their web pages1. In addition, informa-
tion is also available via sites that aggregate CH
information from multiple resources. A typical
example is Europeana2, a web-portal to collec-
tions from several European institutions that pro-
vides access to over 20 million items including
paintings, films, books, archives and museum ex-
hibits.
However, online information about CH arte-
facts is often unstructured and varies by collec-
1http://www.louvre.fr/,
http://www.britishmuseum.org/
2http://www.europeana.eu
tion. This makes it difficult to identify informa-
tion of interest in sites that aggregate informa-
tion from multiple sources, such as Europeana,
or to compare information across multiple collec-
tions (such as the Louvre and British Museum).
These problems form a significant barrier to ac-
cessing the information available in these online
collections. A first step towards improving access
would be to identify similar items in collections.
This could assist with several applications that are
of interest to those working in CH including rec-
ommendation of interesting items (Pechenizkzy
and Calders, 2007; Wang et al, 2008), generation
of virtual tours (Joachims et al, 1997; Wang et al,
2009), visualisation of collections (Kauppinen et
al., 2009; Hornbaek and Hertzum, 2011) and ex-
ploratory search (Marchionini, 2006; Amin et al,
2008).
Information in digital CH collections often in-
cludes multiple types of media such as text, im-
ages and audio. It seems likely that informa-
tion from all of these types would help humans
to identify similar items and that it could help to
identify them automatically. However, previous
work on computing similarity in the CH domain
has been limited and, in particular, has not made
use of information from multiple types of media.
For example, Grieser et al (2011) computed sim-
ilarity between exhibits in Melbourne Museum
by applying a range of text similarity measures
but did not make use of other media. Tech-
niques for exploiting information from multi-
media collections have been developed and are
commonly applied to a wide range of problems
such as Content-based Image Retrieval (Datta et
al., 2008) and image annotation (Feng and Lap-
ata, 2010).
85
This paper makes use of information from two
media (text and images) to compute the similar-
ity between items in a large collection of CH
items (Europeana). A range of similarity mea-
sures for text and images are compared and com-
bined. Evaluation is carried out using a set of
items from Europeana with similarity judgements
that were obtained in a crowdsourcing experi-
ment. We find that combining information from
both media produces better results than when ei-
ther is used alone.
The main contribution of this paper is to
demonstrate the usefulness of applying informa-
tion from more than one medium when compar-
ing CH items. In addition, it explores the effec-
tiveness of different similarity measures when ap-
plied to this domain and introduces a data set of
similarity judgements that can be used as a bench-
mark.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes some relevant previous
work. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe the text and im-
age similarity measures applied in this paper and
how they are combined. Sections 6 describes the
experiments used in this paper and the results are
reported in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 draws
the conclusions and provides suggestions for fu-
ture work.
2 Background
2.1 Text Similarity
Two main approaches for determining the similar-
ity between two texts have been explored: corpus-
based and knowledge-based methods. Corpus-
based methods rely on statistics that they learn
from corpora while knowledge-based methods
make use of some external knowledge source,
such as a thesaurus, dictionary or semantic net-
work (Agirre et al, 2009; Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007).
A previous study (Aletras et al, 2012) com-
pared the effectiveness of various methods for
computing the similarity between items in a CH
collection based on text extracted from their
descriptions, including both corpus-based and
knowledge-based approaches. The corpus-based
approaches varied from simple word counting ap-
proaches (Manning and Schutze, 1999) to more
complex ones based on techniques from Infor-
mation Retrieval (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
1999) and topic models (Blei et al, 2003). The
knowledge-based approaches relied on Wikipedia
(Milne, 2007). Aletras et al (2012) concluded
that corpus-based measures were more effective
than knowledge-based ones for computing simi-
larity between these items.
2.2 Image Similarity
Determining the similarity between images has
been explored in the fields such as Computer Vi-
sion (Szeliski, 2010) and Content-based Image
Retrieval (CBIR) (Datta et al, 2008). A first step
in computing the similarity between images is to
transform them into an appropriate set of features.
Some major feature types which have been used
are colour, shape, texture or salient points. Fea-
tures are also commonly categorised into global
and local features.
Global features characterise an entire image.
For example, the average of the intensities of red,
green and blue colours gives an estimation of the
overall colour distribution in the image. The main
advantages of global features are that they can be
computed efficiently. However, they are unable
to represent information about elements in an im-
age (Datta et al, 2008). On the other hand, lo-
cal features aim to identify interesting areas in
the image, such as where significant differences
in colour intensity between adjacent pixels is de-
tected.
Colour is one of the most commonly used
global features and has been applied in sev-
eral fields including image retrieval (Jacobs et
al., 1995; Sebe and Michael S. Lew, 2001;
Yu et al, 2002), image clustering (Cai et al,
2004; Strong and Gong, 2009), database index-
ing (Swain and Ballard, 1991) and, object/scene
recognition (Schiele and Crowley, 1996; Ndjiki-
Nya et al, 2004; Sande et al, 2008). A common
method for measuring similarity between images
is to compare the colour distributions of their his-
tograms. A histogram is a graphical representa-
tion of collected counts for predefined categories
of data. To create a histogram we have to specify
the range of the data values, the number of dimen-
sions and the bins (intervals into which ranges
of values are combined). A colour histogram
records the number of the pixels that fall in the
interval of each bin. Schiele and Crowley (1996)
describe several common metrics for comparing
colour histograms including ?2, correlation and
86
intersection.
2.3 Combining Text and Image Features
The integration of information from text and im-
age features has been explored in several fields.
In Content-based Image Retrieval image features
are combined together with words from captions
to retrieve images relevant to a query (La Cas-
cia et al, 1998; Srihari et al, 2000; Barnard
and Forsyth, 2001; Westerveld, 2002; Zhou and
Huang, 2002; Wang et al, 2004). Image cluster-
ing methods have been developed to combine in-
formation from images and text to create clusters
of similar images (Loeff et al, 2006; Bekkerman
and Jeon, 2007). Techniques for automatic image
annotation that generate models as a mixture of
word and image features have also been described
(Jeon et al, 2003; Blei and Jordan, 2003; Feng
and Lapata, 2010).
2.4 Similarity in Cultural Heritage
Despite the potential usefulness of similarity in
CH, there has been little previous work on the
area. An exception is the work of Grieser et al
(2011). They computed the similarity between a
set of 40 exhibits from Melbourne Museum by
analysing the museum?s web pages and physi-
cal layout. They applied a range of text similar-
ity techniques (see Section 2.1) to the web pages
as well as similarity measures that made use of
Wikipedia. However, the Wikipedia-based tech-
niques relied on a manual mapping between the
items and an appropriate Wikipedia article. Al-
though the web pages often contained images of
the exhibits, Grieser et al (2011) did not make use
of them.
3 Text Similarity
We make use of various corpus-based approaches
for computing similarity between CH items since
previous experiments (see Section 2.1) have
shown that these outperformed knowledge-based
methods in a comparison of text-based similarity
methods for the CH domain.
We assume that we wish to compute the simi-
larity between a pair of items, A and B, and that
each item has both text and an image associated
with it. The text is denoted as At and Bt while
the images are denoted by Ai and Bi.
3.1 Word Overlap
A common approach to computing similarity is to
count the number of common words (Lesk, 1986).
The text associated with each item is compared
and the similarity is computed as the number of
words (tokens) they have in common normalised
by the combined total:
simWO(A,B) =
|At ?Bt|
|At ?Bt|
3.2 N-gram Overlap
The Word Overlap approach is a bag of words
method that does not take account of the order
in which words appear, despite the fact that this
is potentially useful information for determining
similarity. One way in which this information can
be used is to compare n-grams derived from a text.
Patwardhan et al (2003) used this approach to ex-
tend the Word Overlap measure. This approach
identifies n-grams in common between the two
text and increases the score by n2 for each one
that is found, where n is the length of the n-gram.
More formally,
simngram(A,B) =
?
n ? n?gram(At,Bt)
n2
|At ?Bt|
where n?gram(At, Bt) is the set of n-grams that
occur in both At and Bt.
3.3 TF.IDF
The word and n-gram overlap measures assign
the same importance to each word but some are
more important for determining similarity be-
tween texts than others. A widely used approach
to computing similarity between documents is to
represent them as vectors in which each term is
assigned a weighting based on its estimated im-
portance (Manning and Schutze, 1999). The vec-
tors can then be compared using the cosine met-
ric. A widely used scheme for weighting terms
is tf.idf, which takes account of the frequency of
each term in individual documents and the num-
ber of documents in a corpus in which it occurs.
3.4 Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Topic models (Blei et al, 2003) are a useful tech-
nique for representing the underlying content of
documents. LDA is a widely used topic model
87
that assumes each document is composed of a
number of topics. For each document LDA re-
turns a probability distribution over a set of topics
that have been derived from an unlabeled corpus.
Similarity between documents can be computed
by converting these distributions into vectors and
using the cosine metric.
4 Image Similarity
Two approaches are compared for computing the
similarity between images. These are largely
based on colour features and are more suitable for
the images in the data set we use for evaluation
(see Section 6).
4.1 Colour Similarity (RGB)
The first approach is based on comparison of
colour histograms derived from images.
In the RGB (Red Green Blue) colour model,
each pixel is represented as an integer in range of
0-255 in three dimensions (Red, Green and Blue).
One histogram is created for each dimension. For
grey-scale images it is assumed that the value of
each dimension is the same in each pixel and a
single histogram, called the luminosity histogram,
is created. Similarity between the histograms in
each colour channel is computed using the inter-
section metric. The intersection metric (Swain
and Ballard, 1991) measures the number of cor-
responding pixels that have same colour in two
images. It is defined as follows:
Inter(h1, h2) =
?
I
min(h1(I), h2(I))
where hi is the histogram of image i, I is the set
of histogram bins and min(a, b) is the minimum
between corresponding pixel colour values.
The final similarity score is computed as the av-
erage of the red, green and blue histogram simi-
larity scores:
simRGB(Ai, Bi) =
?
i?{R,G,B}
Inter(hAi , hBi)
3
4.2 Image Querying Metric (imgSeek)
Jacobs et al (1995) described an image similar-
ity metric developed for Content-based Image Re-
trieval. It makes use of Haar wavelet decompo-
sition (Beylkin et al, 1991) to create signatures
of images that contain colour and basic shape in-
formation. Images are compared by determining
the number of significant coefficients they have in
common using the following function:
distimgSeek(Ai, Bi) = w0|CAi(0, 0)? CBi(0, 0)|
+
?
i,j:C?Ai (i,j) 6=0
wbin(i,j)(C?Ai(i, j) 6= C?Bi(i, j))
where wb are weights, CI represents a single
colour channel for an image I , CI(0, 0) are scal-
ing function coefficients of the overall average in-
tensity of the colour channel and C?I(i, j) is the
(i, j)-th truncated, quantised wavelet coefficient
of image I . For more details please refer to Ja-
cobs et al (1995).
Note that this function measures the distance
between two images with low scores indicating
similar images and high scores dis-similar ones.
We assign the negative sign to this metric to assign
high scores to similar images. It is converted into
a similarity metric as follows:
simimgSeek(Ai, Bi) = ?distimgSeek(Ai, Bi)
5 Combining Text and Image Similarity
A simple weighted linear combination is used to
combine the results of the text and image similar-
ities, simimg and simt. The similarity between a
pair of items is computed as follows
simT+I(A,B) = w1 ? simt(At, Bt)
+ w2 ? simimg(Ai, Bi)
where wi are weights learned using linear regres-
sion (see Section 6.4).
6 Evaluation
This section describes experiments used to evalu-
ate the similarity measures described in the previ-
ous sections.
6.1 Europeana
The similarity measures are evaluated using infor-
mation from Europeana3, a web-portal that pro-
vides access to information CH artefacts. Over
2,000 institutions through out Europe have con-
tributed to Europeana and the portal provides ac-
cess to information about over 20 million CH arte-
facts, making it one of the largest repositories
3http://www.europeana.eu
88
of digital information about CH currently avail-
able. It contains information about a wide vari-
ety of types of artefacts including paintings, pho-
tographs and newspaper archives. The informa-
tion is in a range of European languages, with
over 1 million items in English. The diverse na-
ture of Europeana makes it an interesting resource
for exploring similarity measures.
The Europeana portal provides various types of
information about each artefact, including textual
information, thumbnail images of the items and
links to additional information available for the
providing institution?s web site. The textual in-
formation is derived from metadata obtained from
the providing institution and includes title, de-
scription as well as details of the subject, medium
and creator.
An example artefact from the Europeana por-
tal is shown in Figure 1. This particular artefact
is an image showing detail of an architect?s office
in Nottingham, United Kingdom. The informa-
tion provided for this item is relatively rich com-
pared to other items in Europeana since the title is
informative and the textual description is of rea-
sonable length. However, the amount of informa-
tion associated with items in Europeana is quite
varied and it is common for items to have short
titles, which may be uninformative, or have very
limited textual descriptions. In addition, the meta-
data associated with items in Europeana is poten-
tially a valuable source of information that could
be used for, among other things, computing simi-
larity between items. However, the various pro-
viding institutions do not use consistent coding
schemes to populate these fields which makes it
difficult to compare items provided by different
institutions. These differences in the information
provided by the various institutions form a signif-
icant challenge in processing the Europeana data
automatically.
6.2 Evaluation Data
A data set was created by selecting 300 pairs of
items added to Europeana by two providers: Cul-
ture Grid4 and Scran5. The items added to Eu-
ropeana by these providers represent the major-
ity that are in English and they contain different
types of items such as objects, archives, videos
and audio files. We removed five pairs that did
4http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/
5http://www.scran.ac.uk/
not have any images associated with one of the
items. (These items were audiofiles.) The result-
ing dataset consists of 295 pairs of items and is
referred to as Europeana295.
Each item corresponds to a metadata record
consisting of textual information together with a
URI and a link to its thumbnail. Figure 1 shows an
item taken from the Europeana website. The title,
description and subject fields have been shown
to be useful information for computing similar-
ity (Aletras et al, 2012). These are extracted and
concatenated to form the textual information as-
sociated with each item. In addition, the accom-
panying thumbnail image (or ?preview?) was also
extracted to be used as the visual information. The
size of these images varies from 7,000 to 10,000
pixels.
We have pre-processed the data by removing
stop words and applying stemming. For the
tf.idf and LDA the training corpus was a total of
759,896 Europeana items. We have filtered out
all items that have no description and have a ti-
tle shorter than 4 words, or have a title which has
been repeated more than 100 times.
6.3 Human Judgements of Similarity
Crowdflower6, a crowdsourcing platform, was
used to obtain human judgements of the simi-
larity between each pair of items. Participants
were asked to rate each item pair using a 5 point
scale where 4 indicated that the pair of items were
highly similar or near-identical while 0 indicated
that they were completely different. Participants
were presented with a page containing 10 pairs of
items and asked to rate all of them. Participants
were free to rate as many pages as they wanted up
to a maximum of 30 pages (i.e. the complete Eu-
ropeana295 data set). To ensure that the annota-
tors were not returning random answers each page
contained a pair for which the similarity had been
pre-identified as being at one end of the similarity
scale (i.e. either near-identical or completely dif-
ferent). Annotations from participants that failed
to answer correctly these questions or participants
that have given same rating to all of their answers
were removed. A total of 3,261 useful annotations
were collected from 99 participants and each pair
was rated by at least 10 participants.
The final similarity score for each pair was gen-
6http://crowdflower.com/
89
Figure 1: Example item from Europeana portal showing how both textual and image information are displayed.
(Taken from http://www.europeana.eu/portal/)
erated by averaging the ratings. Inter-annotator
agreement was computed as the average of the
Pearson correlation between the ratings of each
participant and the average ratings of the other
participants, a methodology used by Grieser et
al. (2011). The inter-annotator agreement for the
data set was ? = +0.553, which is comparable
with the agreement score of ? = +0.507 previ-
ously reported by Grieser et al (2011).
6.4 Experiments
Experiments were carried out comparing the re-
sults of the various techniques for computing text
and image similarity (Sections 3 and 4) and their
combination (Section 5). Performance is mea-
sured as the Pearson?s correlation coefficient with
the gold-standard data.
The combination of text and image similarity
(Section 5) relies on a linear combination of text
and image similarities. The weights for this com-
bination are obtained using a linear regression
model. The input values were the results obtained
for the individual text and similarity methods and
the target value was the gold-standard score for
each pair in the dataset. 10-fold cross-validation
was used for evaluation.
7 Results
An overview of the results obtained is shown in
Table 1. Results for the text and image similarity
methods used alone are shown in the left and top
part of the table while the results for their combi-

ficient).
nation are in the main body.
The best performance for text similarity (0.487)
is achieved by Word Overlap and the lowest by
N-gram Overlap (0.399). The results are surpris-
ing since the simplest approach produces the best
results. It is likely that the reason for these re-
sults is the nature of the textual data in Europeana.
The documents are often short, in some cases the
description missing or the subject information is
identical to the title.
For image similarity, results using imgSeek are
higher than RGB (0.370 and 0.254 respectively).
There is also a clear difference between the per-
formance of the text and image similarity meth-
ods and results obtained from both image similar-
ity measures is lower than all four that are based
on text. The reason for these results is the nature
of the Europeana images. There are a large num-
ber of black-and-white image pairs which means
that colour information cannot be obtained from
90
many of them. In addition, the images are low
resolution, since they are thumbnails, which lim-
its the amount of shape information that can be
derived from them, restricting the effectiveness of
imgSeek. However, the fact that performance is
better for imgSeek and RGB suggests that it is still
possible to obtain useful information about shape
from these images.
When the image and text similarity measures
are combined the highest performance is achieved
by the combination of the Word Overlap and
imgSeek (0.554), the best performing text and im-
age similarity measures when applied individu-
ally. The performance of all text similarity mea-
sures improves when combined with imgSeek.
All results are above 0.5 with the highest gain
observed for N-gram Overlap (from 0.399 to
0.504), the worst performing text similarity mea-
sure when applied individually. On the other
hand, combining text similarity measures with
RGB consistently leads to performance that is
lower than when the text similarity measure is
used alone.
These results demonstrate that improvements
in similarity scores can be obtained by making
use of information from both text and images. In
addition, better results are obtained for the text
similarity methods and this is likely to be caused
by the nature of the images which are associated
with the items in our data set. It is also impor-
tant to make use of an appropriate image similar-
ity method since combing text similarity methods
with RGB reduces performance.
8 Conclusion
This paper demonstrates how information from
text and images describing CH artefacts can be
combined to improve estimates of the similarity
between them. Four corpus-based and two image-
based similarity measures are explored and eval-
uated on a data set consisting of 295 manually-
annotated pairs of items from Europeana. Results
showed that combing information from text and
image similarity improves performance and that
imgSeek similarity method consistently improves
performance of text similarity methods.
In future work we intend to make use of other
types of image features including the low-level
ones used by approaches such as Scale Invari-
ant Feature Transformation (SIFT) (Lowe, 1999;
Lowe, 2004) and the bag-of-visual words model
(Szeliski, 2010). In addition we plan to apply
these approaches to higher resolution images to
determine how the quality and size of an image
affects similarity algorithms.
