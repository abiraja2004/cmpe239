1 PROJECT H ISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS 
1.1 OVERVIEW 
Spanish-English machine translation (SPANAM) has been 
operational at the Pan American Health Organization 
(PAHO) since 1980. As of May 1984, the system's 
services had been requested by 87 users under 572 job 
orders, and the project's total output corresponded to 
7,040 pages (1.76 million words) that had actually been 
used in the service of PAHO's activities. The translation 
program runs on an IBM mainframe computer (4341 
DOS/VSE), which is used for many other purposes as 
well. Texts are submitted and retrieved using the ordi- 
nary word-processing workstation (Wang OIS/140) as a 
remote job-entry terminal. Production is in batch mode 
only. The input texts come from the regular flow of 
documentation i  the Organization, and there are no 
restrictions as to field of discourse or fype of syntax. A 
trained full-time post-editor, working at the screen, 
produces polished output of standard professional quality 
at a rate between two and three times as fast as tradi- 
tional translation (4,000-10,000 words a day versus 
1,500-3,000 for human translation). The post-edited 
output is ready for delivery to the user with no further 
preparation required. 
The SPANAM program is written in PL/I. It is 
executed on the mainframe at speeds as high as 700 
words per minute in clock time (172,800 words an hour 
in CPU time), and it runs with a size parameter of 215 K. 
Its source and target dictionaries (60,150 and 57,315 
entries, respectively, as of May 1984) are on permanent- 
ly mounted isks and occupy about 9 MB each. 
While SPANAM continues to build its reputation as a 
work horse, at the same time development is well 
advanced on a parallel system that translates from 
English into Spanish, ENGSPAN. Also written in PL/I, 
ENGSPAN uses essentially the same modular system 
architecture that has been developed for SPANAM, but it 
is conceived on the basis of up-to-date linguistic theory 
leading to rule-based strategies for the parsing of syntac- 
tic and semantic information. The overall policy is to 
regularly upgrade SPANAM as breakthroughs become 
available in the more sophisticated ENGSPAN. In this 
way it has been possible to maintain ongoing production 
with SPANAM while its capabilities are gradually 
enhanced and expanded. Because of this dynamic mode 
of development, information about the theoretical status 
of either SPANAM or ENGSPAN is necessarily short- 
lived. 
1.2 EARLY HISTORY: 1976-1979 
The Pan American Health Organization, with headquar- 
ters in Washington, D.C., is the specialized international 
agency in the Americas that has responsibility for action 
in the field of public health. It comes under the umbrel- 
las of both the Inter-American System and the UN fami- 
ly, serving in the latter instance as Regional Office of the 
World Health Organization. In addition to its headquar- 
ters staff of 546 in Washington, PAHO has a field staff of 
652 that supports both the operational programs in its 10 
Pan American centers, located in eight different coun- 
tries, and its 30 representational offices, in 28 countries. 
Business may be conducted in any of the four official 
languages: Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French. 
The translation demand is greatest into Spanish, which 
over the years has corresponded .to more than half the 
total workload, and, after that~ into English. The 
demand for Portuguese is considerably smaller, and there 
is only an occasional requirement for French. 
In 1975 the Organization's administrators undertook a
feasibility study and determined that MT might be a 
means of reducing the expenditure for translation. There 
was already a mainframe computer, then an IBM 360, at 
the headquarters ite, and the decision was made to 
l Respectively, Chief, Terminology and Machine Translation Program, 
PAHO, and Senior Computational Linguist, Machine Translation 
Project, PAHO.

Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Learn SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
develop an MT system that would run on this installation 
on a time-sharing basis. Work was to focus on the Span- 
ish-English and English-Spanish combinations. The 
effort was to be supported under the Organization's 
regular budget. 
The intention from the outset was that MT should 
articulate with the routine flow of text in PAHO. Post- 
editing was considered to be unavoidable, since the 
system would have to deal with free syntax, with any 
vocabulary normally used in the Organization, and, in 
time, with a large range of subjects and different genres 
of discourse. No serious thought was given to a mode of 
operation that would require pre-editing. 
Initial work was begun in 1976. A team of three part- 
time consultants worked for the Organization for two 
years, and one of these consultants remained with the 
project for a third year. In the beginning the approach 
drew upon a number of the principles that had evolved at 
Georgetown University in the late 1950s and early 1960s 
in the course of work on the Russian-English system 
known as GAT (Georgetown Automatic Translation, 
described in Zarechnak 1979). 
The first language combination to be addressed was 
Spanish-English. The consultants had opted for this 
direction recognizing that results could be available arli- 
er than if they had started with English as the source. 
Parallel efforts were concentrated on the architecture 
itself of the system and the extensive supporting soft- 
ware. The period 1976-1978 saw the mounting of this 
architecture and the writing of a basic algorithm for the 
translation of Spanish into English. At the end of three 
years the Spanish-English algorithm was in place, as well 
as eight other PL/I support programs that performed a
variety of related tasks. The Spanish source dictionary 
had been built to a level of 48,000 entries (at that time 
the verbs required full-form entries), with corresponding 
English glosses in the separate target dictionary. Work 
on the dictionaries was supported by mnemonic, user- 
friendly software developed in 1978-1979 to facilitate 
the operations of updating, side-by-side printing, and 
retrieval of individual records. A corpus of about 50,000 
words had been translated from Spanish into English. 
Efforts from English into Spanish had produced one page 
of text. 
Human resources during the period 1976-1978 
consisted of the three part-time consultants together with 
PAHO's contribution in the form of dictionary manpower 
(total of 24 staff-months in the three-year period) and, 
starting in 1977, half-time participation of the staff 
terminologist, who assumed the responsibility of coordi- 
nation. A full-time computational linguist was recruited 
and assigned to the project in 1979. 
The year 1980 was a turning point for MT at PAHO. 
Advances came together which made it possible to move 
into a production mode. To begin with, the computa- 
tional linguist took full charge of the system software, 
replacing the consultants. Up to that time production 
had not been feasible because there was no morphologi- 
cal analysis of verbs: the failure to find a high percent- 
age of inflected verbs had meant that many sentences in 
random text were barred from even the most rudimentary 
analysis. Thus the first order of business was to develop 
the needed morphological lookup. 
At the same time, the operational problems of text 
input, another major impediment o production, were 
also resolved. An interface stablished between the IBM 
mainframe and the Organization's word-processing facili- 
ty (then a Wang System 30) enabled MT to take its place 
in the text-processing chain and tap into a large body of 
text that had been made machine-readable for other 
purposes. A conversion program was written which 
handled the differences in representation of characters, 
solved ambiguities of punctuation, and made certain deci- 
sions about the format. From the time this program was 
installed, any Spanish text that had been keyed onto the 
word processor, regardless of the purpose for which it 
was entered, was available for machine translation. 
1.3 OPERATIONAL PHASE: 1980-PRESENT 
As production gained momentum, the MT staff was 
increased by the assignment of a full-time post-editor and 
by greater participation of the terminologist as head of 
the project. 
Over the next two years, the sources of machine-read- 
able text for SPANAM increased at a steady pace. The 
use of word processing at PAHO expanded, and, in addi- 
tion, another mode of input became possible through 
optical character recognition (OCR). Whereas word proc- 
essing had previously been restricted to special services 
provided by a typing pool, after the installation of word- 
processing hardware throughout he headquarters build- 
ing (Wang OIS/140), all program units eventually came 
to participate in the text-processing chain. Furthermore, 
the optical character eader (a Compuscan Alphaword 
II), previously used only for Telex transmission, was 
interfaced with the word-processing system; this meant 
that existing typewriters could also be used as input 
devices, and therefore that texts could be prepared in the 
field and machine-read in Washington. 
With accelerated production, improvements to 
SPANAM have followed in tandem. From the beginning 
it has been the policy, and continues to be so today, that 
the output from production serves not only to meet the 
purpose for which it was requested but also to provide 
feedback for further development of the algorithm and 
dictionaries. As post-editing proceeds, note is made of 
recurring problems at all levels. Capture of this informa- 
tion at the time of post-editing saves much work later on. 
The messages written by the post-editor on the side-by- 
side text serve as a basis both for updating the diction- 
aries and for making enhancements, as feasible, in the 
algorithm. 
In this way the Spanish source dictionary had grown to 
a total of 60,120 entries as of May 1984. Of this total, 
94% were bases or stems and 6% were full forms, all 
with corresponding entries in the English target. Since 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 123 
Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie LeOn SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
1981 the incidence of not-found words in random text 
has been well under 1% - limited usually to proper 
names, scientific names, new acronyms, and nonce 
formations. Through coordination with the terminology 
side of the program, the glosses have been increasingly 
tailored to the specific requirements of PAHO. In addi- 
tion, microglossaries have been established for various 
users, so that specialized translations can be elicited. 
In its four years of operation, SPANAM has become 
not only wiser but more efficient as well. The program's 
speed of run time has increased from 160 words per 
minute to over 700 wpm. Yet the algorithm, even though 
it has sustained a major reorganization into modular 
structure and regularly undergoes enhancement, remains 
approximately the same size (2,085 statements as of May 
1984). 
Further details about the working environment of 
SPANAM are given in sections 2 and 6. 
1.4 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT SPANAM/ENGSPAN: 
1981-PRESENT 
In early 1981 a long-range strategy was decided on for 
the continued improvement of SPANAM and the develop- 
ment of a parallel system from English into Spanish. 
Two consultants from Georgetown University, Professors 
Ross Macdonald and Michael Zarechnak, undertook 
separate evaluations of SPANAM at that time. Their 
recommendations led to the adoption of a combined 
working mode in which improvements were to be intro- 
duced in SPANAM according to a predetermined schedule 
while at the same time development began on the other 
system, ENGSPAN. Recognizing that each language 
combination imposed a different set of linguistic priori- 
ties, the consultants nevertheless emphasized that greatly 
expanded parsing was needed in both cases, especially in 
the analysis of English as a source language. Such pars- 
ing, in turn, called for revision of the dictionary record in 
order to allow for a broader range of syntactic and 
semantic oding. It was felt that the basic modular archi- 
tecture of SPANAM, as well as the dictionary record in its 
essential format, should also be used for ENGSPAN. A 
common architecture for the two systems meant hat they 
could continue to share the same supporting software. 
Thus, improvements could migrate readily from one 
system to the other; it wouid be easy for them to cross- 
fertilize. 
Having adopted this approach to development, with 
each side to benefit systematically from the work being 
done on the other, the project addressed its attention in 
1981 to the enhancements hat had been recommended 
for SPANAM. Then, as the SPANAM effort tapered off, 
time was devoted increasingly to ENGSPAN. By the end 
of 1982, the ENGSPAN program and dictionaries (about 
40,000 source entries, most of them with acceptable 
glosses in the Spanish target) were in place. 
Translation from English into Spanish has special 
importance for public health in the developing countries, 
and this fact provided the incentive for seeking extrabud- 
getary support from the U.S. Agency for International 
Development (AID). In August 1983, AID gave the 
Organization a two-year grant for the accelerated evel- 
opment of ENGSPAN. 2 This funding has made it possible 
to have a second computational linguist for the grant 
period, as well as consultants and part-time dictionary 
assistants who have undertaken specific tasks within the 
approved plan of work. 
With the added manpower, the project has made 
significant progress on the English-Spanish algorithm. 
Particular focus has been placed on the development of a 
parser using an augmented transition network (ATN), 
which as of April 1984 was integrated into the rest of the 
ENGSPAN program. The dictionary record has been 
modified, without any increase in its overall size, so that 
it can now accommodate 211 fields, as compared with 82 
in the 1980 version of SPANAM. Deep syntactic and 
semantic coding has been introduced for dictionary 
entries corresponding to a sizable proportion of the 
experimental corpus of 50,000 running words. 
2 APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT 
2.1 PRE-EDITING POLICY 
As indicated above, it has always been expected that the 
output of SPANAM and ENGSPAN would have to be 
post-edited. There was no application of MT at PAHO 
for which a customized language would be feasible. 
Since post-editing was inevitable, it was felt that a pre- 
editing step would be anti-economic: the advantages to 
be gained would not be sufficient o offset the added cost 
of a second human pass. Moreover, in order for pre-edit- 
ing to be worthwhile, the process would have to draw on 
a high degree of linguistic sophistication, and adequate 
manpower for this purpose would be scarce: the pre-edi- 
tor would need to be well prepared not only in trans- 
lation skills but also in knowledge of the algorithm, or at 
least a number of its capabilities and limitations. 
Thus, pre-editing in the linguistic sense has been ruled 
out for SPANAM and ENGSPAN. In theory, a document 
can be sent for execution by SPANAM without being seen 
by any human eyes. If the operator has keyed in the 
original Spanish document using normal in-house typing 
conventions, no adjustments whatsoever are required. 
With inexperienced operators, however, and with texts 
read automatically by the OCR, the precaution is taken to 
check the format, particularly the line-spacing and page 
width, since deviations from the standard at that level 
can disrupt the work of the algorithm. 
Production texts are run only once. Demonstrations 
are always performed on random text.

2.2 POST-EDITING POLICY 
2.2.1 GENERAL POSITION 
The multifaceted approach to post-editing is an impor- 
tant feature of SPANAM. On one level, consideration is
given to the user's needs and capabilities and to the 
purpose of the translation. At the same time, specific 
linguistic strategies developed by the project are often 
used in order to minimize the recasting of certain 
unwieldy constructions which frequently recur - mainly 
the result of verbs in sentence-initial position in Spanish. 
Finally, there is a series of word-processing aids that help 
to speed up the physical process of editing and to deal 
with pragmatic decisions in the SPANAM output which 
are not handled by syntactic rules. 
The degree of post-editing is determined by: 
1. the purpose of the translation, 
2. the user's own resources for editing, 
3. the time frame, and 
4. structural linguistic considerations in the text itself. 
A text may be needed for information only, for publica- 
tion, or for a variety of uses between these two extremes. 
If it is to be edited by the requesting office, only the most 
glaring problems are dealt with by the post-editor. On 
the other hand, if it is to be published without much 
further review, the post-editor devotes careful attention 
to the quality of the text. These factors are determined 
in a conference with the user at the time the job is 
submitted. As to time constraints, it may happen that the 
work has to be delivered under considerable pressure: 
information-only translations of 20-25 pages may have to 
be delivered within a couple of hours, and once a 
40-page proposal for funding was delivered in polished 
form the same day it was requested. With translation for 
publication, however, longer periods are negotiated. 
Contrary to what might be deduced from the nature of 
PAHO's mission, SPANAM is asked to cope with a wide 
range of subject areas and types of text. There have 
been: documents for meetings, international agreements, 
technical and administrative r ports, proposals for fund- 
ing, summaries and protocols for international data 
bases, journal articles and abstracts, published 
proceedings of scientific meetings, training manuals, 
letters, lists of equipment, material for newsletters - even 
film scripts. 
In an open, "try-anything" (Lawson 1982:5) system 
such as SPANAM, with its highly varied applications, 
experience has led to the conclusion that post-editing 
requires a trained professional translator. Whereas 
Martin Kay (1982:74) suggests that the person who 
interprets machine output "would not have to be a trans- 
lator and could quite possibly be drawn from a much 
larger segment of the labor pool", the SPANAM experi- 
ence suggests that this conclusion would be valid only for 
technical experts working on a text for information 
purposes only. Even in such cases, the technicians at 
PAHO are encouraged to request a more careful trans- 
lation of passages that are of particular interest. 
Only an experienced translator will be aware of the 
words whose variable meanings are dependent on extra- 
linguistic context. For example proyecto in Spanish can 
mean 'project', 'proposal', or 'draft', and the choice 
depends on full knowledge of the situation to which the 
text refers. Esperar can mean 'hope' or 'expect', and the 
distinction is essential in English - sometimes even 
crucial. Such ambiguities require the attention of a trans- 
lator with training, experience, good knowledge of the 
subject matter vocabulary in both languages, and a tech- 
nical understanding of what is meant by the text. Only a 
person with this combined background is in a position to 
make the choices that will fully reflect the intention of 
the original author. Another area in which the transla- 
tor's role is important is in interpretation of the degree of 
intensity associated with relative terms. For example, 
trascendente in Spanish can have much less force than its 
English cognate, and the entire tone of a message may be 
over- or underdrawn, depending on the interpretation 
given to a key term of this nature. Indeed, it has been 
the experience of SPANAM that users, even technical 
experts, can misinterpret he glosses appearing in the 
machine output and assign an altogether incorrect mean- 
ing in the process of "correcting" the text. The role of 
the experienced translator is not to be underestimated. 
2.2.2 LINGUISTIC STRATEGIES 
In addition to experience in the interpretation of nuances, 
the post-editor needs a strong linguistic background in 
order to master the particular strategies that have proved 
to be effective in the processing of SPANAM output. For 
the inexperienced post-editor, the most time-consuming 
task is the recasting that is deemed to be "required" 
when machine-translated constructions turn out to be 
ungrammatical or intolerably awkward in the English 
output. SPANAM has addressed this problem by devel- 
oping a series of "quick-fix" post-editing expedients 
(QFP) for dealing with the typical problems of Spanish- 
to-English translation. For example, certain maneuvers 
are suggested as being useful in the case of fronted verb 
constructions in Spanish, which occur frequently and 
present difficulties for the standard SVO pattern in 
English. The purpose of the QFP is to minimize the 
number of steps required in order to make the sentence 
work. Since it was a V(S)O construction that triggered 
the problem in the first place, any solution that avoids 
reordering will necessarily depart from one-on-one 
syntactic fit. In other words, in the example of the front- 
ed verb, one might try to see if the opening phrase, which 
will be a discourse adjunct, a cognitive adjunct (terms 
from Halliday 1967), or the main verb itself, could be 
nominalized so that it might serve as the subject of the 
sentence in English. Such an approach manages to 
preserve in the theme position (Halliday 1967) the cogni- 
tive material which had been thematic in the source text, 
usually with a parallel effect on the focus position as well 
(Vasconcellos 1985b). For this reason, the result is often 
quite satisfactory, even compared with a translation that 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 125 
Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Leon SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
is syntactically more "faithful" (see Section 6 below and 
also Vasconcellos, in preparation)? The examples below 
compare QFPs with solutions that were actually proposed 
by translator-post-editors (traditional human translation 
- THT). 
In example (1), the semantic ontent of the fronted 
verb is reworked into a noun phrase that can serve as the 
subject of the sentence. Time is saved by leaving the 
rheme of the sentence untouched; only a few characters, 
highlighted inside the box, were changed. Moreover, 
additional speed was gained by making changes from left 
to right, in the same direction in which the text is being 
reviewed.

MT: During 1983 t~e \[ was initiated already \[ the

THT: During 1983 these proposals already began to be

keystrokes) 
QFP: During 1983 \[ progress began toward \[ the 
gradual transformation f these proposals into 
actions. (27 keystrokes) 
In example (2), on the other hand, the adjunct itself is 
nominalized, again with a significant saving of time and 
keystrokes. 
(2) En este estudio se buscarfi contestar dos preguntas 
fundamentales: 
MT: ~ this study \[ it will be sought \[ to 
answer two fundamental questions: 
THT: In this study answers to two fundamental ques- 
tions will be sought: (53 keystrokes) 
QFP: This study l, seeks | to answer two fundamental 
questions: (14 keystrokes) 
Use of the foregoing approach, wherever feasible, 
adds up to substantial economy, with apparently little or 
no deterioration in the quality of the translation (see 
Section 6 below)? However, knowing when and how to 
make such changes requires considerable skill. This is 
one more reason why the post-editor should have a 
strong background both in translation and, if possible, in 
hngulsttcs as well? 
It is always emphasized in SPANAM that editorial 
changes hould be kept to the minimum needed in order 
to make the output intelligible and acceptable for its 
intended purpose? 
2.2.3 WORD-PROCESSING STRATEGIES 
The SPANAM post-editors work directly on-screen. 
Experience has shown that post-editing on hard copy, 
with the changes entered by a "word-processing 
operator", is not a highly efficient mode. Accordingly, 
attention has also been given to speeding up the post-edit 
by automating as many of the recurring operations as 
possible. 
The SEARCH-and-REPLACE function on the word 
processor is heavily used in post-editing. In addition, 
SPANAM has a set of special aids developed for the 
purposes of MT. Besides a full set of possible word 
switches ( lx l ,  l x2 ,  2x l ,  2x2,  l x3 ,  3x l ,  3x3,  etc.), 
there are routines that deal with the character strings that 
most often have to be changed in SPANAM output? For 
example, only a single "glossary" keystroke is needed to 
perform the following editorial operations: 
SEAR CH-and-DELETE: 
the, of, there, to, in order to 
SEAR CH-and-REPLA CE: 
from~of, for~of, for~by, in order to - / for  -ing, a/the, 
which~that, who~that, every~each, among~between, such 
as~as, some of the~some 
The inventory can be changed or expanded at will. 
2.2.4 OTHER TIME-SAVERS 
From the discussion above, it can be seen that speed in 
post-editing is achieved by a combination of strategies. 
Some of the points made may appear on the surface to be 
almost trivial, but yet they can add up to a significant 
difference? One example of an apparently trivial factor is 
the method of positioning the cursor under the string to 
be-modified. Delays at this point can add up to a surpris- 
ing proportion of total time spent on post-editing, since 
they will occur with every change that is made. Informal 
experiments suggest hat the most efficient approach for 
positioning the cursor is to always use the SEARCH key. 
The "mouse" and the light pencil appear to be less effec- 
tive. The slowest method, unfortunately, seems to be the 
one that is most often used, namely simple manual strik- 
ing of the directional keys. Since people tend to rely on 
the directional keys unless otherwise trained, this point is 
emphasized with the post-editors who work on SPANAM. 
The staff of the project are constantly on the lookout 
for new ways of saving time. All tasks are streamlined as 
much as possible? A series of programs have been devel- 
oped on the word processor for automating the house- 
keeping support that has to be done apart from 
post-editing, and recently some of this work was made 
even more efficient by passing it on to the mainframe 
computer. Printing is kept to a minimum; finished 
production is delivered to the user either on a diskette or 
by a telephone call notifying the office that the job is 
available on the system? 
2.3 POST-EDITING VIS-a-VIS OTHER ASPECTS 
OF THE SYSTEM 
In the SPANAM environment here is a close link 
between post-editing and the other aspects of the system. 
The staff post-editor has been trained to update the 
dictionaries, and currently almost all the dictionary work 
126 Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 
Muriei Vasconcellos and Marjorie Le~n SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
on SPANAM is done by this person. Required changes to 
the dictionaries are proposed at the time of post-editing. 
Hence there is no need to go through the text a second 
time. Also, glosses and other solutions seem to come to 
mind most readily when the whole text is actually being 
worked on. The post-editor, if adequately trained in 
updating, is in the best position to see what dictionary 
changes are necessary in order to deal with the specific 
constructions that tend to recur in production trans- 
lations. 
The post-editor also alerts the computational linguist 
to areas where the algorithm needs improvement. 
2.4 INTEGRATION OF THE SYSTEM INTO A COMPLETE 
TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENT 
SPANAM/ENGSPAN, the terminology activity, and the 
traditional human translation unit are in the process of 
being merged into a single program of language services 
at PAHO. While human and machine translation even 
now coordinate the workload to a certain extent, as of 
May 1984 there was not yet any centralized screening of 
incoming jobs. It is expected that such a triage will make 
it possible to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the respective services. 
Combination of the two activities will also make for a 
more rational utilization of the manpower available at 
any given time, with the staff being assigned to a variety 
of different duties, depending on both needs and skills. 
It is also a goal to reduce a given person's day in front of 
the screen from eight hours to six through the rotation of 
assignments. 
In the area of management, the SPANAM/ENGSPAN 
programs on the mainframe computer are also helping 
with labor-intensive operations for which the human 
translation service is responsible: it is already performing 
automatic word counts, and spelling check systems are 
being developed for both English and Spanish. 
In terms of the linguistic work of the human translator, 
SPANAM/ENGSPAN can help to lighten the load in a 
number of ways. To begin with, technical and scientific 
terms are retrieved in context, which means that MT is a 
sort of very efficient lexical data base. With an ordinary 
LDB, the translator has to go to the terminal (which is 
not usually at his desk for his use alone), sign on, and 
initiate a search. After he has performed all the mechan- 
ical steps, there is still the possibility that the term is not 
in the data base at all, and his effort will have been wast- 
ed. When this happens repeatedly over time, a cumula- 
tive frustration builds up. With SPANAM/ENGSPAN, on 
the other hand, not only does the translator know imme- 
diately what translation has been assigned to the term, he 
is also told its degree of reliability and whether or not it is 
in the WHOTERM data base. The status of the terms is 
indicated by small superscript symbols which can be 
requested at the time the text is sent for translation. 
WHOTERM is also on the word-processing system. Its 
general file contains: a definition of each term in 
English, translation equivalents in up to four languages 
besides English, synonyms if there are any, a reliability 
code for the primary term in each language, scope notes, 
and a subject code. In addition to the general file, it has 
files with: names of organizational entities, full equiv- 
alents for abbreviations, cientific names of pathogens, 
generic names of drugs in three languages, and chemical 
names of pesticides with trade names cross-referenced to 
them (Ahlroth & Lowe 1983). 
SPANAM also aids the translator with its system of 
microglossaries for specialized subject areas (see Section 
4.3 below). When a text is known to deal with a certain 
subject, the translator can request a corresponding micro- 
glossary which will contain alternate glosses. One or 
more of these microglossaries can be specified at the time 
the job is submitted. The translator can also have a 
mieroglossary of his own in which he can store special 
terms he prefers to use. 
It is also possible for SPANAM to provide alternate 
choices in the output entry, such as project/ 
proposal~draft, hope~expect, time~weather, tc., although 
this is not the regular policy. These alternatives can be 
stored in a microglossary. In the output, the undesired 
translation is eliminated by striking a single glossary key. 
If the translator provides feedback in the form of 
suggested or requested changes in the dictionaries, the 
updating can be done immediately. Some of SPANAM's 
users have developed the habit of providing regular feed- 
back, and this means that their translations become 
increasingly tailored to their specific requirements. 
While there is no doubt that SPANAM/ENGSPAN 
reach their maximum efficiency when post-edited 
on-screen, at the same time studies are being done on 
ways in which a translator can dictate his changes o that 
they can be entered by a word-processing operator work- 
ing from a tape. 
The human translation service stands to benefit, also, 
from the sophisticated facilities that have been developed 
on the word processor for editing and housekeeping 
support. 
3 GENERAL TRANSLATION APPROACH 
Since the bulk of the Organization's translation work 
involves only Spanish and English, the machine trans- 
lation system was developed specifically for this pair of 
languages. No consideration was given to using the 
interlingua pproach. The broad range of subject areas 
to be dealt with precluded the use of a knowledge-based 
approach or one based on a representation of the mean- 
ing of the text. Although the systems are currently 
language-specific, significant portions of the algorithm 
could be adapted for use in a system involving 
Portuguese or French, the other official languages of the 
Organization. Because SPANAM and ENGSPAN were 
developed separately, they reflect different theoretical 
orientations and utilize different computational tech- 
niques. At the same time, they have many features in 
common.

Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Le6n SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
SPANAM was originally designed as a direct trans- 
lation system. The translation is produced through a 
series of operations which analyze the Spanish source 
string, transform the surface structure to produce a 
syntactic frame for the English target string, substitute 
the English glosses indicated by the results of the analy- 
sis, insert and/or delete certain grammatical morphemes, 
and synthesize the required endings on the English 
words. The principal stages involved in the translation 
algorithm are: morphological analysis and single-word 
lookup, gap analysis, multi-word unit lookup, homograph 
resolution, subject identification, treatment of prep- 
ositions, object pronoun movement, verb string analysis, 
subject insertion, do-insertion, noun phrase rearrange- 
ment, target lookup, target synthesis. 
ENGSPAN is a lexical and syntactic transfer system 
based on the slot-and-filler approach to language struc- 
ture. It performs a separate analysis of the English 
source string, applies transfer routines based on the 
contrastive analysis of English and Spanish, and then 
synthesizes the Spanish target string. The principal stag- 
es of this algorithm are: morphological analysis and 
single-word lookup, gap analysis, substitution and analy- 
sis unit lookup, sentence-level parse, transfer unit lookup, 
target lookup, syntactic transfer, and target synthesis. 
The program includes backup modules for homograph 
resolution, verb string analysis, and noun phrase analysis, 
which are called in if the sentence-level parse is unsuc- 
cessful. 
4 LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES 
4.1 MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
SPANAM's morphological lookup procedure makes it 
possible to find most Spanish words in their stem forms. 
The algorithm recognizes plural and feminine endings for 
nouns, pronouns, determiners, quantifiers, and adjec- 
tives; person, number and tense endings for verbs; and 
derivational endings such as -mente/-ly. Bound clitic 
pronouns are separated from verb forms, and any accent 
mark related to the presence of the clitic is removed. 
Another subroutine adds missing accent marks when the 
source word is written with an initial capital or in all capi- 
tal letters. The components of compounds formed with 
hyphens or slashes are looked up as separate words. A 
few prefixes are also removed from words without a 
hyphen. 
ENGSPAN's morphological nalysis procedure, known 
as LEMMA, is called if the full-form is not found in the 
dictionary and the word consists of at least four alpha- 
betic characters. This procedure checks for the presence 
of a number of different endings, including -'s, -s; -s, -ly, 
-ed, -ing, -er, -est, and -n't. Each time an ending is 
removed, the new form of the word is looked up. 
LEMMA uses morphological nd spelling rules and short 
lists of exceptions in order to determine when to remove 
or add a final -e, when the word ends in a double conso- 
nant, etc. If a lemmatized form of the word is found in 
the dictionary, its record is checked to make sure that its 
part of speech corresponds with the ending which was 
removed. If LEMMA exhausts all its possibilities, the 
word is checked against a small list of prefixes (re-, non-, 
un-, sub-, and pre-). If one of these prefixes can be 
removed, another lookup is performed. If this final look- 
up is unsuccessful, a dummy record is created for the 
word and a gap analysis routine is called. "Not-found" 
words are initially considered to be nouns and given the 
possibility of also functioning as verbs and adjectives. 
Information from both LEMMA and derivational suffixes 
is used in order to confirm or reassign the main part of 
speech, as well as to confirm, remove, or add possibilities 
for ambiguities. 
The lookup strategy used in both SPANAM and 
ENGSPAN keeps down the size of the dictionary while 
allowing a good deal of flexibility. The dictionary coder 
has the option of entering a word in its full form, in one 
or more of its inflected forms, or in its stem form. With 
irregular forms and homographs, the full form must be 
used. For example, in the Spanish source dictionary the 
only entries for the word esperar are the stem esper and 
the verb/noun homograph espera. The English source 
dictionary contains an entry for expect and unexpected, 
but not for expects, expected, expecting, or unexpectedly. 
4.2 HOMOGRAPH RESOLUTION 
SPANAM deals with homographs at several different 
stages of the program. Ambiguities that can be resolved 
by morphological clues or capitalization are handled by 
the lookup procedure. Proper names are also identified 
at this stage. One-character words are distinguished 
from letters of the alphabet after the lookup has been 
completed. The homograph resolution module handles 
other types of homographs by examining the surrounding 
context. 
The possible parts of speech for a word are indicated 
in the dictionary record in a series of bit fields which 
include: verb, noun, adjective, pronoun, determiner, 
numerative, preposition, modifier, adverb, conjunction, 
auxiliary, and prefix. Any combination of two or more 
bits may be coded. Other sequences of bit codes are 
used to distinguish between different ypes of pronouns, 
adverbs, and conjunctions: relative, interrogative, nomi- 
nal, adverbial, connector, compound, and coordinate. 
The use of multiple-word substitution units reduces 
the number of lexical ambiguities which must be resolved 
by the algorithm. Analysis units may also be used to 
selectively specify the part of speech of any or all of the 
words covered by the unit. 
ENGSPAN's front-line approach to homograph resol- 
ution is embodied in the ATN parser, described in Section 
5.3. The English words can be coded for the same possi- 
ble parts of speech as in SPANAM. Determination of the 
function of each word depends on the path taken through 
the network. The sequence of parts of speech which 
leads to the first successful parse is used as the basis for 
the transfer stage. 
128 Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 
Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Leon SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
There are three ways in which lexical information 
from the dictionary is used to help the parser arrive at the 
correct analysis. Substi;ution units compress idioms into 
one record with a single part of speech. Analysis units 
can be used to indicate that a group of words can be 
expected to occur in a collocation with a particular func- 
tion. This information may be overridden, whenever 
necessary, by the parser. An individual word may also be 
coded to indicate which of its possible parts of speech is 
statistically most frequent. Again, the final decision is 
made by the parser based on the results of the sentence- 
level analysis. 
4.3 POLYSEMY 
SPANAM/ENGSPAN have two principal tools for dealing 
with polysemy: microglossaries and transfer units. 
Substitution units and analysis units are also used when 
common collocations are involved. 
A microglossary is a sub-dictionary of target glosses 
which can be set up for a particular subject area, 
discourse register, or specific user. Glosses pertaining to 
the subject area of international public health form part 
of the main dictionary. Microglossaries are in use for 
special translations of terms in the fields of law, finance, 
sanitary engineering, statistics, and scientific research. 
The system may have up to 99 microglossaries with any 
number of entries in each one. The microglossaries to be 
consulted during the translation of a particular text are 
specified at run time. The existence of a specific micro- 
glossary entry is indicated in the target record containing 
the principal gloss for the word. Thus, no time is wasted 
looking for special translations of every word. More than 
one microglossary may be activated for the same trans- 
lation, in which case they are listed and consulted in 
order of priority. 
The transfer unit is a rule that is stored in the source 
dictionary and is retrieved after the analysis of the 
sentence has been completed. The existence of a trans- 
fer unit is indicated in the record corresponding to the 
individual source word. A transfer unit contains a condi- 
tion to be tested and an action to be performed. Exam- 
ples of conditions are: 
? Subject of this verb has X feature(s) or is word W. 
? Object of this verb (or preposition) has X feature(s) 
or is word W. 
? This word modifies a word with X feature(s) or modi- 
fies word W. 
? This word has N object(s). 
? Context N word(s) to left/right contains word with X 
feature(s). 
Transfer units are explicitly ordered in the dictionary. 
The action may either select an alternative translation, 
insert a word such as a preposition, or delete one or more 
words. The action also indicates whether or not addi- 
tional transfer entries should be sought for the same 
word. 
4.4 SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC FEATURES 
The dictionary record for each lexical item (including 
substitution units) contains bit fields that are used to 
store information about its syntactic and semantic 
features. These features are used in both the analysis 
and transfer stages of the translation. For example, 
verbs and deverbal nouns are specified as occurring with 
one or more of the following codes: no object, one 
object, two objects, complement, no passive, locative, 
marked infinitive, unmarked infinitive, declarative clause, 
imperative clause, interrogative clause, gerund, adjunct, 
bound preposition, and object followed by bound prepo- 
sition. Subject and object preferences can be specified as 
_+Human, +Animate, and +Concrete. Other fields are 
reserved for case frames. Features which can be coded 
for nouns include Count, Bulk, Concrete, Human, 
Animate, Feminine, Proper, Collective, Device, Location, 
Time, Quantity, Scale, Color, Nationality, Material,  
Apposition, Body part, Condition, and Treatment. 
Adjectives are coded for many of the same features 
mentioned above. In addition, they can be coded as 
Inflectable, Optionally Inflectable, General, Temporary 
condition, Positive connotation, and Negative connota- 
tion. Adverbs can be coded as Time, Place, Manner, 
Motive, Interruptive, and Connector. One of the refer- 
ences used in developing the coding scheme for the 
English entries was Naomi Sager's Natural Language 
Information Processing ( 1981). 
4.5 ANNOTATED SURFACE STRUCTURE NODES 
In ENGSPAN, the structure produced by the parser 
consists of a graph containing nodes corresponding to 
each clause and phrase. Each node contains a list of its 
constituents, their roles, and their locations. If the 
constituent is a lexical item, the location is a word 
number; if it is a phrase or a clause, the location is the 
pointer to the appropriate node. Each node is annotated 
with features applicable to the type of phrase or clause 
involved. These features include Type, Mood, Person, 
Number, Tense, Aspect, and Voice. 
Both the ATN formalism and the structural represen- 
tation used in ENGSPAN draw heavily on the presenta- 
tion of ATN parsers and systemic grammar in Winograd 
(1983). Winograd's discussion, in turn, is based on the 
work of Woods (1970, 1973) and Kaplan (1973). Of 
course, the ATN parser has necessarily had to be adapted 
to the needs and computational environment of the 
PAHO project. 
4.6 SPANISH VERB SYNTHESIS 
The procedure for the synthesis of Spanish verb forms is 
based on principles of generative morphology and 
phonology. The program synthesizes all regular and 
most of the irregular verbs, in all tenses and moods 
except the future subjunctive, and in all persons except 
the second person plural. The verb is entered in the 
target dictionary in its stem form. Binary codes are used 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 1 I, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 129 
Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie LeOn SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
to specify the conjugation class and the 11 exception 
features which govern the synthesis of the irregular 
forms. Only one dictionary entry is needed for each 
verb. A small number of highly irregular stems and full 
forms (74 in all) are listed in a table. The majority of 
"stem-changing" verbs require no special synthesis 
coding. The procedure consists of a series of morpholog- 
ical spellout rules; raising, lowering, diphthongization, 
and deletion rules based on phonological processes; 
stress assignment rules; and orthographic rules to handle 
predictable spelling changes. 
5 COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES 
5.1 DICTIONARIES 
The SPANAM/ENGSPAN dictionaries are VSAM files 
stored on a permanently mounted disk. The source and 
target dictionaries are separate files. The basic record 
has a fixed length of 160 bytes. The source entry is 
linked to its target gloss by means of a 12-digit lexical 
number (LEX). The first six digits of the LEX are the 
unique identification umber assigned to each pair when 
it is added to the dictionary. The second half of the LEX 
is used to specify alternative target glosses associated 
with the same source entry. The main or default target 
gloss for each pair has zeroes in these positions. 
5.1.1 SINGLE-WORD ENTRIES 
The key for a source entry is the lexical item itself, which 
may be up to 30 characters in length. The source 
dictionary is arranged alphabetically. The key for a 
target entry is the LEX, and the target dictionary is 
arranged in numerical order. 
Words may be entered in the source dictionary either 
with or without inflectional endings. Most nouns are 
entered only in the singular and adjectives only in the 
masculine singular. Verbs are entered as stems. Full- 
form entries are required for auxiliary verbs, words with 
highly irregular morphology, and homographs. 
Several source items may be linked to the same target 
gloss by assigning them to the same LEX. For example, 
irregular forms of the same verb or alternative spellings 
of a word require only one entry in the target dictionary. 
Likewise, more than one target gloss can be linked to the 
same source word through the lexical number. In this 
case, each alternative gloss is distinguished by coding in 
the second half of the LEX. Two positions are used to 
designate terms belonging to microglossaries, two for 
glosses corresponding to different parts of speech, and 
two for context-sensitive glosses which are triggered by 
transfer units. 
5.1.2 MULTIPLE-WORD ENTRIES 
The dictionaries contain four types of multiple-word 
entries: substitution units (SU), analysis units (AU), 
delayed substitution units (DSU), and transfer units (TU). 
The key for a multiple-word entry in the source diction- 
ary is a string consisting of the first six digits of the LEX 
for each word in the unit. In the case of an SU or an AU, 
the words must occur consecutively in the sentence in 
order for the unit to be activated. A DSU or a TU can 
cover either a continuous or discontinuous string. 
The basic SU contains from two to five words. A 
different record structure is used for longer entries, such 
as names of organizations and titles of publications. 
When an SU is retrieved, the dictionary records corre- 
sponding to the individual words are replaced with one 
record corresponding to the entire sequence. The gloss 
for the unit is also found in a single entry in the target 
dictionary. This type of unit is essential in order to 
obtain the correct translation of names of organizations, 
titles of publications, slogans, etc., and is an efficient way 
of handling some fixed idioms, phrasal prepositions, and 
certain technical terminology. An SU record has the 
same format as a single-word entry. In addition, it 
contains a character string which indicates the part of 
speech of each of its members. This information can be 
used by the parser if it is unable to parse the sentence 
using the single part of speech specified by the unit. 
Examples of phrases entered as SUs are by leaps and 
bounds, International Drinking Water Supply and Sanita- 
tion Decade, and Health for All by the Year 2000. 
The AU, which also contains from two to five words, 
has several functions. At the very least, it alerts the anal- 
ysis routines to the possible presence of a common 
phrase and provides information on its length and func- 
tion. It can also be used to resolve the part-of-speech 
ambiguity of any of its members. Finally, it can specify 
an alternative translation for one or more of its parts. 
The AU is an entry in the source dictionary but has no 
counterpart in the target dictionary. The record for each 
source word is retained in the representation of the 
sentence, but the last two digits of its lexical number are 
modified if a translation other than the main gloss is 
desired. When the target lookup is performed, the gloss 
for each word is retrieved separately. This ensures that 
the rules for analysis and synthesis of conjoined modifi- 
ers will be able to access information about the individual 
words of the phrase. It also makes it possible for the 
parser to determine whether or not the individual words 
are being used as a unit in the given context. Examples 
of phrases entered as AUs are drinking water and patient 
care. The algorithm is still able to correctly analyze 
sequences uch as the children have been drinking water 
with a high fluoride content, and it is essential that the 
patient care for himself. 
The DSU is used to handle lexical items such as phrasal 
verbs which are likely to occur as noncontiguous words 
in the input. The existence of a DSU is indicated in the 
source record of the first word of the unit. The unit is 
retrieved from the dictionary during the sentence-level 
parse. The decision of whether or not to accept he unit 
is based on both syntactic and semantic requirements of 
the parser. If the unit is accepted, it replaces the individ- 
ual records and causes a different target gloss to be 
130 Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 
Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Le~n SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
retrieved. Examples of DSUs are look up, put on, and 
carry out. 
The TU is used to specify an alternate translation of a 
word or words which depends on the occurrence of a 
specific word or set of features in one of its arguments or 
in a specified environment. These entries are stored in 
the source dictionary only and are retrieved after the 
analysis "has been completed. If the conditions pecified 
in the transfer entry are met, the corresponding lexical 
numbers are modified so that the desired target gloss is 
selected during the target lookup. For example, if the 
object of know is coded as+Human,the v rb is translated 
as conocer instead of saber. If female and male modify a 
noun coded as -Human,  they are translated as hembra 
and macho instead of mujer and hombre. 
5.2 GRAMMAR RULES 
SPANAM, up to now, uses two basic types of grammar 
rules: pattern matching and transformations. Pattern 
matching is used for the recognition and reordering of 
noun phrases. The grammatical patterns are stored in a 
file which can be updated without recompiling the 
program. The patterns are applied by searching for the 
longest match first. Transformations are used to identify 
and synthesize the verb phrases and clitic pronouns. The 
rules are expressed in PL/I  code and are grouped in 
modules according to the part of speech of the head 
word. Each group of rules is tested once for each 
sentence. The structural description of each rule is 
compared with the input string. The description may 
require a match of parts of speech, syntactic features, or 
specific lexical items. If a match is found, the rule is 
applied. The rule may permute, add, delete, or substitute 
lexical items or features associated with them. 
As indicated earlier, ENGSPAN's grammar ules are 
expressed in the form of an ATN. The network config- 
uration indicates possible sequences of constituents. The 
rules governing the acceptability of any specific input 
string are contained in the conditions attached to the 
various arcs of the network. The building of the nodes of 
the structural representation and the assignment of 
features and roles is determined by actions associated 
with each arc. The conditions and actions are contained 
in separate modules which are part of the compiled 
program. The configuration of states and arcs is speci- 
fied in a file which is updated on-line. The contents of 
this file also determine which of the conditions and 
actions are actually attached to specific arcs for a partic- 
ular run. 
As of May 1984 the ATN grammar had seven 
networks: sentence, clause, noun phrase, verb phrase, 
sentence nominalization, hyphenated compound, and 
prepositional phrase. Each network consists of a set of 
states connected by arcs. Four types of arcs are used: 
category arcs, which can be taken if the part of speech 
matches that of the input word; jump arcs, which can be 
taken without matching a word of the input; seek arcs, 
which initiate recursive calls to a network; and send arcs, 
which return control to the calling network after the 
successful parsing of a constituent. 
5.3 PARSING ALGORITHM 
The ENGSPAN algorithm performs a top-down, left-to- 
right sequential parse using a combination of chronologi- 
cal and explicit backtracking. The parser stops after 
completing the first successful parse. The path taken 
through the network depends on the ordering of the arcs 
at each state, the structural information already deter- 
mined by the parser, and the codes contained in the 
dictionary record for each lexical item and multiple-word 
entry. Also available to the parser is information regard- 
ing sentence punctuation, capitalization, parenthetical 
material, etc., which has been gathered by an earlier 
procedure. The algorithm processes the words of the 
input string one at a time, moving from left to right. At 
each state, all arcs are tested to determine whether they 
may be taken for the current word. The possible arcs are 
placed on a pushdown stack and the top arc on the stack 
is taken. The parser continues through the input string as 
long as it can find an arc that it is allowed to take. If no 
arc is found for the current word, the parser backtracks. 
Which of the alternative arcs is taken off the stack 
depends on the situation which caused the parser to 
backtrack. If the end of the string is reached and the 
algorithm is at a final state in the network, the parse is 
successful. If no path can be found through the network, 
the parse fails. 
Long-distance dependencies such as those involved in 
relative clauses and WH-questions are parsed by using a 
hold Hst. When the parser encounters a noun phrase 
followed by a relative pronoun, a copy of the phrase is 
placed on the hold list. When a question is being parsed, 
the questioned element is placed on the list. When a gap 
is detected in the relative clause or interrogative 
sentence, the phrase on the hold list is used to fill the 
appropriate slot. 
Whenever backtracking is required, a wel l - fo rmed 
phrase list is used to save a copy of the phrases that have 
been completed but are about to be modified or rejected. 
For all seek arcs, the parser checks to see if a phrase of 
the appropriate type is already on the well-formed phrase 
list. If there are several phrases on the list that begin 
with the same word, the longest phrase is tried first. A 
new phrase is parsed only if there is nothing on the well- 
formed phrase list that satisfies the seek arc. In this way, 
large amounts of reparsing are avoided. 
Conjoining is currently being handled by a configura- 
tion of arcs at the end of each subnetwork which allows 
additional phrases of the same type to be parsed recur- 
sively. When partial phrases are conjoined, the end of 
the subnetwork is reached by traversing one or more 
jump arcs. 
In the event of an unsuccessful parse, ENGSPAN is 
still expected to produce a translation. The longest 
successful path is always saved, and information from 
this "partial parse" can be used by the synthesis routines. 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 131 
Muriel VasconceHos and Marjorie Ledn SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
Local routines are used to analyze the remainder of the 
input string. These routines function as a "safety net". 
They resolve homograph ambiguities and analyze verb 
strings and noun strings, adding as much information as 
they can to the structural description of the sentence as a 
whole. 
The ATN parsing algorithm is being developed in an 
independent PL/I program, using the ENGSPAN input 
and dictionary lookup modules. 3 It is also totally compat- 
ible with SPANAM. The network grammar is read in at 
runtime, making it possible to experiment with different 
network configurations without recompiling the program. 
Each time an enhanced version of the parser has been 
tested and debugged, it replaces the working version in 
the ENGSPAN program. The diagram in Figure 1 shows 
the relationship between the parser and the "safety net" 
routines in ENGSPAN. The parser is to be incorporated 
in a similar way into SPANAM as well. 
A complete description of the ATN grammar and 
parser will be found in the report to be submitted to the 
U.S. Agency for International Development at the end of 
the grant period (October 1985). 
6 PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 
6.1 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE 
6.1.1 DICTIONARIES: SPANAM 
As of May 1984, the Spanish source dictionary had 
60,150 entries and the English target had 57,315. The 
program for updating the SPANAM dictionaries is user- 
friendly. Many default codes are entered by the update 
program automatically. Even though there are now 211 
possible fields in which codes can be entered, as opposed 
to the original 82, almost all of them can be specified 
using mnemonic descriptors and code names. 
Today, updating is done almost exclusively on the 
basis of production text. Every job reveals ways in which 
the dictionaries can be improved, with either new glosses 
for individual words or idiomatic phrases, especially in 
the case of technical terminology, or deeper coding of 
existing entries. The steady, ongoing development of the 
dictionaries (Table 1) has ensured both a decrease in 
not-found words, with advantages for program effective- 
ness, and closer correspondence to the type of language 
used in the Organization, leaving less work for the post- 
editor. 
As indicated earlier, it is the post-editor who notes the 
changes needed at the time of post-editing and who later 
updates the dictionaries. An hour is reserved for this 
work at the end of the day. When production permits, 
the post-editor may spend extra time on dictionary work; 
3 A major portion of the parsing routines have been developed by Lee 
Ann Schwartz, who has participated in this activity on a full-time basis 
since August 1983. 
if there is pressure, the work may have to be postponed 
for a while. Because of the integration of dictionary- 
building into the work of the post-editor, the cost is no 
longer an element that can be clearly identified.

corresponding target records were deleted by a special-purpose 
program after selection of the desired gloss. 
3 1,000 irregular verb forms were deleted by a special-purpose program. 
6.1.2 DICTIONARIES: ENGSPAN 
ENGSPAN has the same user-friendly software as 
SPANAM for updating its dictionaries. As of May 1984, 
the English source dictionary had 41,210 entries and the 
Spanish target had 42,638. 
The AID project has provision for two half-time 
dictionary assistants, one a linguist of English mother 
tongue and one a translator of Spanish mother tongue. A 
new deeply coded source entry costs from $0.60 to 
$1.00; Spanish target glosses that require research are 
about the same. Simple changes in existing entries aver- 
age about $0.25 each. 
6.1.3 OTHER SYSTEM MAINTENANCE 
The SPANAM programs are maintained by the staff 
computational linguist, who carries out these tasks in 
addition to development work on ENGSPAN. 
Hardware and system support are provided by the Pan 
American Health Organization. There is no separate 
charge for utilization of the computer, either for time or 
storage space. The project has a permanently assigned 
partition of 512 K in core, as well as 1 MB on disk for 
work space, 8.5 MB for program libraries, and 33.2 MB 
for dictionaries and other permanently mounted files.

6.2 TESTING 
6.2.1 SPANAM 
The output of SPANAM is subject o daily scrutiny by the 
project staff. In addition, weekly demonstrations are 
given for visitors, using random text as input. 
An experimental version of the program is used to test 
and debug system enhancements resulting from 
production feedback and from the research and develop- 
ment being done for ENGSPAN. Before the experimental 
version of the program replaces the production version, a 
control test is performed by translating the same text 
with both programs and comparing the output, using the 
Document Compare software available on the Wang 
OIS/140. This utility program compares the output charac- 
ter by character. The CPU time, throughput ime, and 
number of disk I /O's for both versions are also 
compared. 
6.2.2 ENGSPAN 
An experimental corpus of over 50,000 words was 
selected at the beginning of the project. Sentences are 
chosen from this corpus for the testing of specific 
program modules. Following every major enhancement 
of the algorithm or dictionary, the corpus texts are 
retranslated and the results are compared with previous 
translations. The system is also tested using new texts 
which are translated without previous review by the 
project staff. After the first translation run, the diction- 
ary is updated in order to add not-found words and miss- 
ing codes, and then the translation is rerun. Problem 
sentences from these random texts are retained for use in 
subsequent development tasks. 
6.3 MEASUREMENT CRITERIA 
6.3.1 SPEED: CPU/THROUGHPUT TIME 
SPANAM's speeds, both CPU and throughput time, have 
steadily improved over the years (Table 2). The best 
throughput time speeds are obtained at night, when there 
are fewer users working on the computer. During the 
day, turnaround at peak periods can be considerably 
slower. The speed is adequate for the current load of 
production. 
When major changes are made in the program, care is 
always taken to make sure that they do not cause any 
extensive degradation of speed. 
The CPU and throughput imes for ENGSPAN are 
1,400 and 400 words per minute, respectively. These 
speeds are expected to decrease as the coverage of the 
ATN grammar is expanded.

6.3.2 COMPARISON WITH HUMAN TRANSLATION SPEED 
With a trained post-editor, SPANAM's output is never 
slower than that of a human translator. The range is 
from one and a half to four times as fast, with the aver- 
age falling between two and three times as fast. The 
SPANAM output ranges from 4,000 to 10,000 words a 
day per post-editor, depending on all the factors 
mentioned above, as well as the sheer difficulty of the 
text. On the other hand, human translators working in 
the international organizations commonly produce 
around 2,000 words a day, although some services report 
an average of 1,500 and others an average of 2,500. It is 
possible to reach 3,000 or even higher, but usually not on 
a regular basis. Free lances report much higher rates. 
Given the variability of both sets of figures, it would be 
difficult to make any hard-and-fast comparisons. 
However, for the same person using both modes, it might 
be possible to draw some conclusions: one translator 
who post-edits for SPANAM reports that she consistently 
produces about three times as much output with MT as 
she does in the traditional way. 
6.3.3 QUALITY: CORRECTNESS 
No systematic error analysis has ever been done of 
SPANAM or ENGSPAN. Three consultants were engaged 
under different contracts to evaluate the overall status of 
the project: Professors Yorick Wilks (1978), Ross 
Macdonald (1981), and Michael Zarechnak (1981). 
While they commented on general characteristics of the 
output, they were more concerned with underlying proc- 
esses that might produce the errors than the errors as 
such. Referring to the quality of the output, Professor 
Macdonald (1981:7) reported: 
The current output is rather good. If a human being had 
written it, perhaps the output would be considered to be 
defective in many respects. When it is known, however, 
that it was produced by a machine, the basis of judgment 
shifts, and the output seems really very presentable. Any 
person of good will can understand this output, and I 
134 Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Numbers 2-3, April-September 1985 
Muriel Vasconcelios and Marjorie Le~n SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
assume that no misleading translations have been discov- 
ered that would vitiate the intent of any article. 
6.3.4 QUALITY: POST-EDITING EFFORT/HUMAN TRANS- 
LATION QUALITY 
The question of effort required for post-editing is inextri- 
cably tied up with standards of human translation. Both 
these issues are highly colored by subjective criteria. In 
Section 2.2 there was a discussion of linguistic strategies 
for reducing the time spent on post-editing. The "quick- 
fix" post-edit takes much less time than a traditional 
revision. 
In an effort to see how translators would handle some 
of the same sentences that had been fixed up quickly in 
post-editing, a set of 17 Spanish source sentences was 
given to 12 trained translators who were asked to provide 
spontaneous human versions in English (Vasconcellos, in 
preparation). No one sentence was translated twice in 
the same way; apart from lexical differences, there was a 
variety of combinations and permutations in the ordering 
of the various phrasal elements. However, when the 
respondents were subsequently shown the "quick-fix" 
alternatives, they agreed that the latter were at least as 
good, or in some cases even better, than what they them- 
selves had proposed - probably because there was great- 
er cohesion in the presentation of the semantic 
components (Vasconcellos 1985b, in preparation). This 
exercise underscored the difficulty of measuring the 
quality of a translation. 
6.4 COST EFFECTIVENESS 
Because of all the variables involved, including in partic- 
ular the purpose of the translation, it is usually rather 
difficult to make clear-cut comparisons between 
SPANAM production and traditional translation at PAHO. 
On one large project, however, such a comparison was 
possible because about half the original text was in Span- 
ish and the other half was in English. The former was 
done on SPANAM and the latter was farmed out to 
human translators who worked in the traditional mode. 
For 101,296 words of machine translation, the cost was 
$3,218, including a hypothetical cost for machine time, 
and 36 staff-days were devoted to the activity. Had the 
same number of words been farmed out in the traditional 
mode, the cost would have been $8,196 and the number 
of staff- and contract-days (based on an output of 2,000 
words a day) would have amounted to 65.75. Hence 
there was a monetary saving of $5,078 (61%) and the 
staff-days were reduced by 29.5 (45%). 
It 'is safe to say that the economy effeeted with 
SPANAM is sufficient o cover the salary of the post-edi- 
tor and perhaps another salary at the same level as well. 
It may yet be some time, however, before the early 
investment in the project is fully recovered. 
Sometimes it is hard to know whether or not SPANAM 
is translating text that would otherwise have been 
submitted for human translation. Quite possibly the user 
is less hesitant to request a machine translation than a 
human one. B. Dostert (1979) has reported this 
phenomenon i a survey of 58 users of MT. 
In the past PAHO has farmed out a large percentage of 
its translation load. As SPANAM and ENGSPAN increas- 
ingly reduce that direct cost, there is clear evidence of 
savings. 
6.5 SUBJECTIVE FACTORS 
The SPANAM staff have come to the understanding that 
in the end an MT system will stand or fall depending on 
the human environment in which it is placed, and that 
some of the most important factors cannot be measured. 
In the broad sense, these include: long-term commitment, 
positive attitudes, innovative responses, creative prob- 
lem-solving. At the more specific level, they include also 
the real availability of input in machine-readable form, a 
cooperative spirit among the staff who must share the 
oversaturated word-processing equipment, willingness on 
the part of the post-editor to use the word processor for 
long periods, resourceful post-editing, and a host of other 
factors of nonresistance that are seldom taken into 
account. 
In addition, if human translators are to be enlisted as 
post-editors, they must have a positive attitude toward 
the capabilities of MT, and, for true gains in productivity, 
they must be willing to use the keyboard and to become 
adept with the special editing features that have been 
developed for the word processor. 
In dealing with the output, there must be flexibility 
and compromise in regard to quality. For example, if the 
rapporteur of a meeting has an hour in which to write up 
what her speakers said, and she can't understand the 
Spanish without a translation, there must be a "can-do" 
type of staff that will produce a document hat can be 
worked from. The need met is the true criterion. 
7 DISCUSSION OF APPROACH ADOPTED 
Macdonald (1979:130-145) has pointed out that MT 
systems tend to polarize toward either an empirical or a 
theoretical approach. Development of the empirical 
system proceeds "on the basis of actual experience with 
appropriate texts" (1981:1), whereas the theoretical 
approach begins by postulating the adequacy of some 
particular model of language description which it is 
hoped will be able to cover all contingencies (1979:130, 
1981:1). 
Each position has its advantages and its disadvantages 
(1981:1). In an empirical approach, the main advantage 
is that the system is more compact in that it concentrates 
on only that which is of immediate usefulness for the task 
at hand. The main disadvantage is that, as the system 
expands, "it becomes difficult to add in new operations 
without reworking some of what has already been done" 
(1981:1). The theoretical system, on the other hand, is 
able to proceed with less disruption, but the disadvantage 
is that "it is extremely difficult to predict as to which of 
all the complexities will actually arise; complexities may

Muriel Vasconcellos and Marjorie Leon SPANAM and ENGSPAN 
be foreseen and planned for in the system which do not 
actually appear in the type of texts to be translated" 
(1981:1). 
Rather than advocate one extreme or the other, 
Macdonald believed that benefit was to be gained from 
both; ideally, he felt, the two positions should be 
combined in a melded system (1979:143): 
On the whole, the best approach is a compromise 
between the two extremes, a basically empirical approach 
in which, however, the researchers strive for an overall 
perspective (1981:1) . . .  
The preliminary research on the empirical system will 
serve the purpose of establishing the nature and extent of 
the problem of machine translation clearly and definitive- 
ly. When the nature of the problem has been recognized 
as fully as possible, a rigorous and elegant solution of the 
problem can be devised (1979:145). 
This view, which came through strongly in the 1981 
recommendations of Macdonald and Zarechnak, is what 
has guided the development of SPANAM/ENGSPAN in 
the last three years. While SPANAM began as a purely 
empirical system, ENGSPAN is now well on its way to 
being a melded system. The flexibility of the basic 
SPANAM/ENGSPAN architecture has made it possible to 
introduce a theoretical focus while still preserving that 
part of the working system which could be used both in 
the interim and as a "safety net" in the event of failed 
parses. 
Rather than weighing the techniques of one MT 
system against those of another, it is felt that a more 
fruitful approach is to establish certain "positive criteria 
of relevance": 
? Who are the system's users? 
? In what environment is it being implemented? 
? What purpose does it serve? 
? On what basis is its use to be justified? 
The strength of a system will lie in its capacity to be rele- 
vant for its users, its environment, its purpose, its justi- 
fication. Judgment from this standpoint is believed to be 
more effective in the long run than evaluation of the rela- 
tive success or failure of a given theory. 
By these standards, SPANAM has proved itself through 
its four years of ongoing production: through the accessi- 
bility of its programs, the user-friendliness of its diction- 
aries, its rapid throughput time, the broad range of text 
for which it produces a usable translation, and the 
savings it has effected in terms of both time and money. 
ENGSPAN is soon to follow suit.
