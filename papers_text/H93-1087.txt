PROJECT GOALS 
The goal of LINGSTAT is to produce an interactive ma- 
chine translation system designed to increase the produc- 
tivity of a user, with little knowledge of the source lan- 
guage, in translating or extracting information from for- 
eign language documents. This system will make use of 
statistical information gathered from parallel and single- 
language corpora, and linguistic information at all levels 
(lexical, syntactic, and semantic). Initial efforts have 
been focused on the translation of Japanese to English, 
but work has also begun on a Spanish version of the sys- 
tem. As resources become available, particularly parallel 
corpora, the Spanish system will be further developed 
and work will be extended to include other European 
languages. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Productivity tests have been conducted on the rudimen- 
tary Spanish version of the workstation. This system in- 
corporates a Spanish de-inflector, provides word for word 
translation to English, and has fast access to an online 
dictionary. On a scaled down version of the DARPA test 
of 7/92 (6 documents instead of 18, including 3 by hand 
and 3 with the aid of the system), a fluent speaker of 
Italian (a language very similar to Spanish) showed no 
productivity gain. At the other extreme, a user with no 
Spanish knowledge and no recent raining in any Euro- 
pean language was about 50% faster using the system's 
online tools than with a paper dictionary. 
There are currently two programs underway to improve 
the translation system. The first is an effort to ex- 
pand the Japanese and Spanish dictionaries, which re- 
quires not only adding words, but also glosses, pronun- 
ciations (for Japanese), and multi-word objects. Part 
of this task involves updating the Japanese and Spanish 
word frequency statistics, which will improve the perfor- 
mance of the tokenizer in Japanese and the de-inflector 
in both languages. Part of speech information is also 
being added, in anticipation of the use of grammatical 
tools.

The second program is the development of a probabilistic 
grammar to parse the source and provide grammatical 
information to the user. This will supplement or replace 
the current rule-based finite-state parser currently im- 
plemented in the system. In the current phase, Dragon 
has chosen a lexicalized context-free grammar, which has 
the property that the probability of choosing aparticular 
production rule in the grammar is dependent on head- 
words associated with each non-terminal symbol. Lexi- 
calization is a useful tool for resolving attachment ques- 
tions and in sense disambiguation. This grammar will be 
trained using the inside-outside algorithm on Japanese 
and Spanish newspaper articles. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
The grammar will be used to provide more accurate 
glossing of the source by making use of co-occurrence 
statistics among the phrase headwords. This requires 
developing an English word list with frequency and part 
of speech information, as well as constructing an English 
inflector-deinflector. These tools, along with an English 
grammar, will enable us to construct candidate transla- 
tions of Japanese phrases and simple Spanish sentences. 
For Japanese sentences and more sophisticated Span- 
ish, Dragon plans to implement lexicalized tree-adjoining 
grammars in both source and target. Tree-adjoining 
grammars provide a rich framework for handling the dif- 
ficult rearrangement of Japanese syntax into English. 
As in the case of context-free grammar, lexicalization 
helps keep the grammar small by resolving attachment 
and disambiguation questions. A translation can be con- 
structed by transferring a parse in the source grammar 
into a parse in the (synchronized) target grammar. 
Each of the analysis methods may produce several can- 
didate translations ofphrases or sentences in the target 
language. All of these candidates will then be rescored 
using a statistical language model in the target language, 
as well as translation and alignment probabilities with 
the source text. The maximum likelihood candidate will 
then be chosen for display to the user, who may then ask 
for more information or alternate translations.
