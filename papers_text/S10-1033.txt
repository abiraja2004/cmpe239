Abstract
In this paper we present a chunk based
keyphrase extraction method for scientific
articles. Different from most previous sys-
tems, supervised machine learning algo-
rithms are not used in our system. Instead,
document structure information is used to
remove unimportant contents; Chunk ex-
traction and filtering is used to reduce the
quantity of candidates; Keywords are used
to filter the candidates before generating
final keyphrases. Our experimental results
on test data show that the method works
better than the baseline systems and is
comparable with other known algorithms.
1 Introduction
Keyphrases are sequences of words which cap-
ture the main topics discussed in a document.
Keyphrases are very useful in many natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications such as doc-
ument summarization, classification and cluster-
ing. But it is an expensive and time-consuming job
for users to tag keyphrases of a document. These
needs motivate methods for automatic keyphrase
extraction.
Most existing algorithms for keyphrase extrac-
tion treat this task as a supervised classifica-
tion task. The KEA algorithm (Gordon et al,
1999) identifies candidate keyphrases using lex-
ical methods, calculates feature values for each
candidate, and uses a machine-learning algorithm
to predict which candidates are good keyphrases.
A domain-specific method (Frank et al, 1999)
was proposed based on the Naive Bayes learn-
ing scheme. Turney (Turney, 2000) treated a
document as a set of phrases, which the learn-
ing algorithm must learn to classify as positive or
negative examples of keyphrases. Turney (Tur-
ney, 2003) also presented enhancements to the
KEA keyphrase extraction algorithm that are de-
signed to increase the coherence of the extracted
keyphrases. Nguyen and yen Kan (Nguyen and
yen Kan, 2007) presented a keyphrase extraction
algorithm for scientific publications. They also in-
troduced two features that capture the positions
of phrases and salient morphological phenom-
ena. Wu and Agogino (Wu and Agogino, 2004)
proposed an automated keyphrase extraction al-
gorithm using a nondominated sorting multi-
objective genetic algorithm. Kumar and Srinathan
(Kumar and Srinathan, 2008) used n-gram filtra-
tion technique and weight of words for keyphrase
extraction from scientific articles.
For this evaluation task, Kim and Kan (Kim
and Kan, 2009) tackled two major issues in au-
tomatic keyphrase extraction using scientific ar-
ticles: candidate selection and feature engineer-
ing. They also re-examined the existing features
broadly used for the supervised approach.
Different from previous systems, our system
uses a chunk based method to extract keyphrases
from scientific articles. Domain-specific informa-
tion is used to find out useful parts in a document.
The chunk based method is used to extract candi-
dates of keyphrases in a document. Keywords of a
document are used to select keyphrases from can-
didates.
In the following, Section 2 will describe the ar-
chitecture of the system. Section 3 will introduce
functions and implementation of each part in the
system. Experiment results will be showed in Sec-
tion 4. The conclusion will be given in Section 5.
2 System Architecture
Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system. The
system accepts a document as input (go through
arrows with solid lines), then does the preprocess-
ing job and identifies the structure of the docu-
ment. After these two steps, the formatted doc-
ument is sent to the candidate selection module

which first extracts chunks from the document,
then uses some rules to filter the extracted chunks.
After candidate selection, the system will choose
top fifteen (ordered by the position of the first oc-
currence in the original document) chunks from
the candidates as the keyphrases and output the
result (?Output1? in Figure 1) which is our sub-
mitted result. The candidates will also be sent
to keyphrase selection module which first extracts
keywords from the formatted document, then uses
keywords to choose keyphrases from the candi-
dates. Keywords extraction needs some training
data (go through arrows with dotted lines) which
also needs first two steps of our system. The result
of keywords selection module will be sent to ?Out-
put2? as the final result after choosing top fifteen
chunks.
OpenNLP

and KEA

are used in chunk extrac-
tion and keywords extraction respectively.
3 System Description
3.1 Preprocessing
In preprocessing, our system first deletes line
breaks between each broken lines to reconnect the
1
http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
2
http://nzdl.org/Kea/
broken sentences while line breaks after title and
section titles will be reserved. Title and section
titles are recognized through some heuristic rules
that title occupies first few lines of a document
and section titles are started with numbers except
abstract and reference. The system then deletes
brackets blocks in the documents to make sure
no keyphrases will be splitted by brackets blocks
(e.g., the brackets in ?natural language processing
(NLP) applications? could be an obstacle to ex-
tracting phrase ?natural language processing ap-
plications?).
3.2 Document Structure Identification
Scientific articles often have similar structures
which start with title, abstract and end with con-
clusion, reference. The structure information is
used in our system to remove unimportant con-
tents in the input document. Based on the anal-
ysis of training documents, we assume that each
article can be divided into several parts: Title, Ab-
stract, Introduction, Related Work, Content, Ex-
periment, Conclusion, Acknowledgement and Ref-
erence, where Content often contains the descrip-
tion of theories, methods or algorithms.
To implement the identification of document
structure, our system first maps each section ti-
tle (including document title) to one of the parts
in the document structure with some rules derived
from the analysis of training documents. For each
part except Content, we have a pattern to map the
section titles. For example, the section title of Ab-
stract should be equal to ?abstract?, the section ti-
tle of Introduction should contain ?introduction?,
the section title of Related Work should contain
?related work? or ?background?, the section title
of Experiment should contain ?experiment?, ?re-
sult? or ?evaluation?, the section title of Conclu-
sion should contain ?conclusion? or ?discussion?.
Section titles which do not match any of the pat-
terns will be mapped to the Content part. After
mapping section titles, the content between two
section titles will be mapped to the same part as
the first section title (e.g., the content between the
section title ?1. Introduction? and ?2. Related
Work? will be mapped to the Introduction part).
In our keyphrase analysis, we observed that
most keyphrases appear in the first few parts of
a document, such as Title, Abstract, and Introduc-
tion. We also found that parts like Experiment,
Acknowledgement and Reference almost have no
159
keyphrases. Thus, Experiment, Acknowledgement
and Reference are removed by our system and
other parts are sorted in their original order and
outputted as formatted document(s) (see in Fig-
ure 1) for further process.
3.3 Candidate Selection
The purpose of candidate selection is to find out
potential keyphrases in a document. Traditional
approaches just choose all the possible words se-
quences and filters them with part-of-speech tags.
This approach may result in huge amount of candi-
dates and lots of meaningless candidates for each
document.
Our system uses chunk based method to solve
these problems.
?A chunk is a textual unit of adjacent
word tokens which can be mutually
linked through unambiguously identi-
fied dependency chains with no recourse
to idiosyncratic lexical information.?
3
Our approach significantly reduces the quantity
of candidates and keep the meanings of origi-
nal documents. For example, for an article ti-
tle, ?Evaluating adaptive resource management
for distributed real-time embedded systems?, the
traditional method will extract lots of meaning-
less candidates like ?adaptive resource? and ?dis-
tributed real-time?, while our method just extract
?adaptive resource management? and ?distributed
real-time embedded systems? as candidates.
3.3.1 Chunk Extraction
The first step of candidate selection is chunk ex-
traction which extract chunks from a document.
Four tools in OpenNLP, SentenceDetector, Tok-
enizer, PosTagger and TreebankChunker, are uti-
lized in our system. The system first evokes Sen-
tenceDetector to split the formatted document into
sentences. Then uses Tokenizer and PosTagger to
label all the words with part-of-speech tag. At last,
TreebankChunker is used to extract chunks from
the document.
3.3.2 Chunk filtering
Not all the extracted chunks can be the candidates
of keyphrases. Our system uses some heuristic
rules to select candidates from extracted chunks.
3
http://www.ilc.cnr.it/sparkle/wp1-prefinal/node24.html
The types of rules range from statistic informa-
tion to syntactic structures. The rules that our sys-
tem uses are based on some traditional methods
for candidate filtering. They are:
1. Any chunks in candidates should have less
than 5 words.
2. Any single word chunks in candidates should
be found at least twice in a document.
3. Any chunks in candidates should be noun
phrases.
4. Any chunks in candidates must start with the
word with the part-of-speech tag (defined in
OpenNLP) NN, NNS, NNP, NNPS, JJ, JJR
or JJS and end with the word with the part-of-
speech tag NN, NNS, NNP or NNPS. Chunks
that do not match these rules will be removed.
Chunks that haven?t been removed will be the
candidate keyphrases of the document.
3.4 Keyphrase Selection
Our analysis shows that keywords are helpful to
extract keyphrases from a document. Thus, key-
words are used to select keyphrases from candi-
date chunks.
3.4.1 Keywords Extraction
KEA is a keyphrase extraction tool, it can also be
used to extract keywords with some appropriate
parameters. We observed that most keyphrases
extracted by KEA only contain one word or two
words which describe the key meaning of the doc-
ument, even when the max length is set to 5 or
more. There are four parameters to be set, in or-
der to get best results, we set maximum length of
a keyphrase to 2, minimum length of a keyphrase
to 1, minimum occurrence of a phrase to 1 and
number of keyphrases to extract to 30. Then, the
output of the KEA system contains thirty keywords
per document.
As showed in Figure 1, KEA needs training data
(provided by the task owner). Our system uses for-
matted documents (generated by the first two steps
of our system) of training data as the input training
data to KEA.
3.4.2 Chunk Selection
After extracting thirty keywords from each docu-
ment, our system uses these keywords to filter out
non-keyphrase chunks from the candidates. The
160
system completes the task in two steps: 1) Re-
move candidates of a document that do not have
any keywords of the document extracted by KEA;
2) Choose the top fifteen (ordered by the position
of the first occurrence in the orginal document)
keyphrases as the answer of a document (?Out-
put2? in Figure 1).
4 Experiment Result
Table 1 shows the F-score of two outputs of our
system and some baseline systems. The first three
methods are the baselines provided by the task
owner. TFIDF is an unsupervised method to rank
the candidates based on TFIDF scores. NB and
ME are supervised methods using Navie Bayes
and maximum entropy in WEKA
4
. KEA refers to
the KEA system with the parameters that can out-
put the best results. OP1 is our system with
the ?Output1? as result and OP2 is our system
with the ?Output2? as result (see Figure 1). In
second column, ?R? means to use the reader-
assigned keyphrases set as gold-standard data and
?C? means to use both author-assigned and reader-
assigned keyphrases sets as answers.

C 17.91% 20.52% 20.36%
Table 1: The comparison of F-score of our system
with other systems.
From the table, we can see that, both two out-
puts of our system made an improvement over the
baseline systems and got better results than the
well known KEA system.
We submitted both results of OP1 and OP2 to
the evaluation task. Because of some misunder-
standing over the result upload system, only the
4

result of OP1 (with bold style) was successfully
submitted.
5 Conclusion
We proposed a chunk based method for keyphrase
extraction in this paper. In our system, document
structure information of scientific articles is used
to pick up significant contents, chunk based candi-
date selection is used to reduce the quantity of can-
didates and reserve their original meanings, key-
words are used to select keyphrases from a docu-
ment. All these factors contribute to the result of
our system.
