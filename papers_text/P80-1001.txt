ON THE SPATIAL USES OF PREPOSITIONS 
Annette Herskovlts 
L ingu is t i cs  Department, Stanford University 
At f i r s t  glance, the spat ia l  uses of prepositions seem 
to const i tu te  a good semantic domain for  a 
computat ional  approach. One expects such uses w i l l  
re fe r  more or less s t r i c t ly  to a closed, exp l i c i t ,  and 
prec i se  chunk of world knowledge. Such an at t i tude  Is 
expressed in the fo l lowing statement: 
"Given descr ip t ions  of the shape of two objects, given 
the i r  l ocat ion  ( for  example, by means ox coordinates in 
Some system of reference),  and, In some cases, the 
locat ion  of  an observer, one can select an appropriate 
prepos i t ion . "  
This paper shows the fa l lacy  of this claim. It 
addresses the problem of interpret ing and generating 
" locat ive  pred icat ions"  (expressions made up of two 
noun-phrases governed by a preposit ion used spat ia l ly ) .  
It i dent i f ies  and describes a number of ob ject  
character i s t i cs  beyond shape (section I) and contextual 
fac tors  (sect ion 2) which bear on these processes. 
Drawing on these descr ipt ions,  the th i rd  section 
proposes core meanings for two categories of 
p repos i t ions ,  and describes some of the t rans for~t tons  
these core meanings are subject to in context. The last  
sec t ion  out l ines  the main d i rect ions of Inquiry 
suggested by the examples and observations in the 
paper. 
1. ~BJECT CHARACTERISTIC~ 
Throughout the paper, I use the term "object ~, meaning, 
s t r i c t ly  speaking, the object together with some 
lextca l  label .  In e f fec t ,  the choice of preposit ion 
depends on the l ex ica l  category  associated with the 
ob jec t  by the noun-phrase used to refer to I t .  And such 
a category  i s  not un ique ly  defined. There are d i f fe rent  
l eve ls  In the categor i za t ion  hierarchy (e.g. "end 
tab le" ,  " tab le" ,  "p iece  of fu rn i tu re ' ) ,  but a l so  
d i f fe rent  perspect ives  on the object .  Consider the 
p ic ture  below. 
,~, , ~ ,  
That patch of  grass could be referred to a l ternate ly  as 
a front.yard, a larun, grass, a patch of pass, etc.  (to assume 
that  these phrases re fe r  to the sane object, one must 
see the grass as a metonymlc subst i tu te  for  tMs patcA of 
grass, and the front.yard as some "area" ra ther  than a 
"s l i ce"  lnc lud ln~ a i r  above and ground under; neither 
view is unreasonable). The permissible prepositions, 
and the i r  in terpreta t ion ,  vary with each re fe r r ing  
phrase: compare in/on the ~ass, ~nion tA~ patcA of ~as~, inK*on) 
tan front.~:rd, onl(*~n) the /reran \ [F i l lmore 1971\]. With this 
warn ing ,  I w i l l  go on speaking of "object 
character i s t i cs ' ,  "object  ident i ty" ,  etc. 
Some of  the ob ject  character i s t i cs  used in production 
and in terpreta t ion  can be computed from the shape of 
the ob jec ts  - -  the axes of symmetry (needed for across tan 
road and along tan ro~d), the "top sur face"  (on t&e label), the 
~out l lne"  (tA, #ird in t~ tree), etc.  (for a descr ip t ion  of 
some of these characteristics, and of their role In 
comprehension, see \[Boggess 1979\]). 
Other character i s t i cs  are not deducible from shape. 
These include: 
1. 1, ALTERNATE GEOM~'I'RIC DESCRIPTIONS 
Objects  ident i ca l  in shape may be "conceived m 
d i f fe rent ly ,  for  instance as surface or as enclosure. 
This may be a choice avai lable to the speaker to 
emphasize cer ta in  aspects (inlon t~$e rug), or I t  may be 
determined for  the category of the reference object (on 
tAe football f ield). 
In under t/te aJater, the water stands for tAe upper free surface 
of tAn ruater; in in the water, i t  .is conceived as a volume. A 
whole category of objects fol lows this rule: see 
(undtr l ln)  tan (snowllakeloceanlsan41.). Such objects tend to be 
viewed only as volumes with "underneath': undcrn~A fat 
lake i s  genera l ly  interpreted as meaning "under the 
lower surface of that  body of water'.  
In tan crack In tan 6~wl, the crack Is In the volume defined 
by the normal surface of the bowl in I ts  uncracked 
s ta te .  In tan milk in tat bowl ,  the milk Is In the volume 
enclosed by the bowl and l imited upward by a plone 
through the rim. 
1.2. FUNCTION 
One says in ran disk and on the tray though these objects uy  
be essent ia l l y  Ident ica l  in shape. One w i l l  not 
o rd inar i l y  say tan cat Is in :At t~e,  but un~r tan t~e,  even 
w i th  the cage- l i ke  table below. 
/oAn is et X Often means that  John Is using I as one 
normal ly  uses i t  (JoAn is at his desk). I f  normal use 
imp l ies  being on or m X, then at Is not used (John is in 
or on the bed, but not at). And to the right of the chadr Is 
de f ined  by reference to a typical  user of the chair. 
1.3. TYPICAl, PHYSICAl, OR GEOMETRICAL CONTEXT 
When using in with areas, i t  Is not su f f i c ient  that the 
re ference object  be two-dimensional; that object must 
be par t  of  a surface divided into cel ls .  One does not 
draw a l ine  in a blackboard; but in tat nlargin is acceptable, 
because the margin is a subdivision of a page. In the 
same fashion, ' geograph ica l  areas (England, tat county, 
etc . )  are sect ions of a divided surface. Some objects 
are exc lus ive ly  conceptualized as parts of a "cel l  
s t ruc ture"  and cannot then fol low at (*at his room, *at 
England). Other  objects can be conceptualized both as 
elements of a ce l l  s t ructure (in the village), or as one of 
a set of  separate  places (at tat ~illage). Or consider ~ard: 
when 1~ is a part  of the grounds of a house, one is 
res t r i c ted  to In. But of somebody working In a Junkyard, 
one could say he is at the )?rd, re f lect ing  a view of the 
yard  as one of  a set of separate locations. 
I f  a door is in i t s  typical  context, i .e.  part of a 
wal l ,  then in terpretat ion  of  m tk~ right of Me d~r must be 
based on the door ' s  own axes. Otherwise ( In a hardware 
s tore  fo r  example) an observer ' s  l ine  of s ight  my 
over r ide  the door ' s  c ross -ax is .  
1.4.  RELATIVE MOBILITY 
The mob i l i ty  of  the reference ob ject  re la t ive  to the 
located  ob jec t  in f luences  the order of the nominals 
a round the prepos i t ion :  the more mobile ob ject  normal ly 
precedes  the prepos i t ion .  One wi l l  not say t/ur ~&,n~ bot~t 
i~ tam one in a cap, but tke one ~dk a ~p on it. Following Tally 
(1978a\ ] ,  I will call the l ocated  object  the "F igure" ,  
and the  re ference  ob jec t  the "Ground", when discuss ing 
the  order  of  the nominals. 
Human beings tend to  p lay  havoc wi th  the re la t ive  
mob i l i ty  ru le ,  e i ther  because  they  are  the pre fer red  
top ic  (flee man i~ a Nu~ coat), or - -  as center of  the 
un iverse  - -  p re fer red  reference ob ject  (tke EmpOe 3t~e 
building i~ in front of me). 
Typ ica l i ty  p lays  an i lpor tant  ro le  in deter l ln lng  an 
appropr ia te  locat ive  pred icat ion  (and no doubt other  
types  o f  express ions) .  The choice of  expression tends 
to  depend not on par t i cu la r  (non prototyp ica I )  
a t t r ibutes  of  the ob jects  considered, but rather  on 
typ ica l  a t t r ibutes  of  the  category to  which they are 
ass igned by the l ingu is t i c  expression. I f  typ ica l  
cond i t ions  do not  obta in ,  they tend to be ignored, 
un less  one has so le specia l  reason to br ing a t tent ion  
to  the a typ ica l  cond i t ions .  I f  fo r  Instance the cap of  
a bot t le  were glued to the wal l ,  one would s t i l l  say tk~ 
bo~tit wLtk a cap on it. Even I f  a t ray  has very high sides, 
one w i l l  say on the tr? 7. Consider also the table  p ic tured  
above.  Imagine the space under i t  p rogress ive ly  more 
so l id ly  enclosed;  there  Is  s po in t  at  which one might 
be s t ruck  by th i s  and say in tat t<d~le. But th i s  po in t  is 
ra ther  fa r  a long;  even w i th  a tab le  wi th  a so l id  sheZt 
a t  f loor  leve l ,  people cons is tent ly  describe ob jects  on 
that  she l f  as  unde~tkt  ta~e. 
2. ~QHTEXTUAL FACTORS 
The cho ice  o f  an appropr ia te  locat ive  pred icat ion  41st  
depends on var ious  aspects of  the context .  Some o~ 
these  contextua l  character i s t i cs  are discussed In th i s  
sect ion  as. i f  they were neat ly  separable; in fac t ,  a l l  
are  in terdependent  in complex ways, and these 
ln ter r re la t ions  must become c lear  before we can design 
models o f  comprehension and product ion.  
2. I .  CONTEXT DEPENDENT PARAMETERS. 
These Inc lude  the locat ion  of  an observer, fo r  the 
de ic t i c  uses of  some prepos l t lons  ~n fro~t oJ'lkt t ry ) ,  and 
an implicit ( fuzzy)  d is tance threshold for  the 
prepos i t ions  ind icat ing  prox imi ty  (Denofsgy 1975\]. 
\ ]n the gas-sfat~ ~s at fat freta~rJ, an impl i c i t  cross-path is 
assumed. To say that  " f reeway"  occurs as a le tony l i c  
subst i tu te  fo r  "a t  the in tersect ion  of a cross-rood 
w i th  the f reeway"  is  not very usefu l ,  since no general 
ru le  o f  metonymy wi l l  pred ic t  th i s  one (as natura l  as  
such a subst i tu t ion  may sound to Engl ish speakers, i t  
i s  not  acceptab le  in French: see ~t  poste ~es~tct ~t ~ la 
route). 
2.2 .  F}GURE/GROUND AS 1GNM~T 
The ass ignment of  the ro les  of  Figure and Ground 
depends pr i~r i l y  on which of  the two ob jects '  l ocat ion  
I s  a t  i ssue.  The ob jec t  whose locat ion  is at  issue 
precedes the prepos i t ion :  compare the tenue nt~zr tam cku~k 
and fA, ?kurcA n~r  tat kouJt. BUt the assigment must also 
respect  the  re la t ive  mob i l i ty . ru le .  TAt kouJe n~r  far ~urck 
i s  revers ib le  because both house and church are equa l ly  
immobi le ;  but  tam ~cycle near tam ?ku~h Is not. When one 
wishes  to  locate  a less mobile ob ject  wi th  respect to a 
more mobi le  one, : there  are a number of per iphras t i c  
dev ices  - -  one" being the use of  "w i th  ~ as in the 
ear l ie r  example (tat bottlt with ? ~p on ~t); "w i th" ,  not 
be ing  bas ica l ly  locat ive ,  Is not subject to th i s  
re la t ive  mob i l i ty  ru le .  See a lso t/~ /~se  is n~r  wk~t tat 
~?~t  Is (but  *tat ko~e is ne?r the ~?')cie ~almy 1978aj); th i s  
tu rns  b~jc/e In to  an immovable ent i ty ,  namely a piece. 
The mob i l i ty  ru le  Is  In fac t  a consequence of  the 
pr inc ip le  that  the ob jec t  whose locat ion  is at  Issue 
shou ld  precede the prepos i t ion .  The Ground is typ ica l ly  
b igger  and less  mobile than the Figure, since those 
ob jec ts  whose locat ion  is most commonly at issue are 
those  which move around, and a good reference ob ject  is  
one whose locat ion  can be In fer red  from I t s  name, and 
thus  had bet ter  be the sase over some time. 
What I s  a t  issue in turn  depends on the speaker's 
purpose  i n  const ruct ing  the locat ive  pred icat ion ,  and 
how I t  f i t s  In to  h i s /her  overa l l  d iscourse plan. 
2. 3. VARYING V|EWPO\[NT ON THE OBJECT 
Ma in ly  th i s  Invo lves  the cont ras t  between a close-up 
and a remote view of  the ob jects .  Most of ten ,  th i s  is 
not  a Bat ter  o f  ac tua l  d is tance,  but s way of  viewing 
an ob jec t  fo r  a g iven purpose: one Jay choose to ignore 
one or  more dimensions, or ln terna l  character i s t i cs  of  
the  ob jec t .  For example, a road uy  be seen as a s t r ip  
(a truck On tke ro?d), or a l i ne  (a oUlateon Mr ro~L~don) .  
Normal ly  beMnd tar kouJt v i i i  be based on the house's own 
axes.  But  when l ook ing  from some distance,  one My use 
one 's  l ine  of  s ight  as  ax is .  
Another  aspect  o f  v iewpo int ,  is the bounded/unbounded 
d is t inc t ion .  Compare w~ng f~rougk versus across the ~at~ 
\[Talmy 1978b\]:  in the former the boundaries of the body 
o f  water  are  Ignored,  but in the la t te r ,  the extension 
o f  the body of  water  from one end to another is  
i nvo lved .  
2 .4 .  RELEVANCE 
G ive= the  p ic tures  below, one w i l l  say t/~ ~,~d un~r  tat 
bomt, but  rht bulb in Mt s~k~.  
The socket  is  s t i l l  funct ion ing  as a socget when fac ing 
down, the bowl not  as a bowl. I f  funct ion  is the 
re levant  aspect ,  i t  Is  of  no In teres t  to d i s t ingu ish  
between s i tuat ions  where bulb and socket are as above, 
and the i r  ups ide down vers ions.  With the bowl, th i s  
d i s t inc t ion  matters .  
Similarly, the pear in 6 is m tke ~I .  It is not 
normal ly  use fu l  to  d is t ingu ish  between s i tuat ion  A and 
A E 
For the  two examples Just  descr ibed, one could cont r ive  
Contexts  in  which the d is t inc t ions  norsa l ly  ignored 
would be impor tant .  And cer ta in ly  adequate lOdels of 
language should account for  th is  poss ib i l i ty .  
A locat ive  expression may describe the general 
in tent ion  of a per}on over some time, rather than his 
p rec i se  locat ion  at the tlme of speaking. I could say 
L~nn is.at.t~e store even if l knew .Lynn might still be on 
her way. But th is  may not be appropriate (e.g. i f  I 
know the addressee is at the s tore ) .  
Relevance is important for Grlcean inferences. For 
instance, from /on is near his desk, one can generally infer 
i on  t~ not at his desk. I f  however I asked a fr iend on the 
phone "are you near your desk? could you look up the 
address . . . " ,  an appropriate answer is "yes", even if my 
f r iend  is at  h is /her  desk. In ~hls context proximity is 
the re levant  aspect, and "near" becomes appropriate. 
2.5. SALIENCE 
The book below le f t  is on the table, the l id  (r ight) is 
not,  because the intervening re lat ion between the l id  
and the jar is salient. Such salience Is not primarily 
a umtter  of the size of some intervening object. 
~#.book  ~5 ' l~ l id  
One genera l ly  says that  X is tn eke field and in the ~mi, 
whenever field or bowl contain X. One ~ay however say 
the dust on the ~ml, and the fertilizer on the ~eid. An adhering 
thln lamina brings attention to contact rather than 
i nc lus ion .  
2.6. HIGHLIGHTING SOME BACKGROUND ELEMENT 
The choice between expressions is often a matter of 
b r ing ing  attention to some. background element rather 
than s igna l l ing  d i f ferences of fact. Thus to tke right, as 
cont ras ted  with on the rigM, tends to highl ight the 
d i s tance  between the two objects, and to evoke travel 
away from the reference object; the contrast cannot 
always be described in terms of objective dif ferences 
in the situations ( i t  sometimes is: thus i f  a th i rd 
ob jec t  of the same kind Is between the two considered, 
only  to the right is appropriate).  And on the right side of the 
bu~lW~ng as contrasted with on the rigkt ~ the b~l~ng brings 
at tent ion  to the wal l .  Consider also Bogota is melon the 
equator; "a t "  will be preferred I f  one wishes to signal 
the presence of some transverse l ine (e.g. a travel 
t ra Jec tory~.  
2. 7. INDETERMINACY 
Most spat ia l  re la t ions  are true given a certa in 
to lerance.  The tolerance has a lower l im i t  defined by 
the nature of the objects; i t s  e f fect ive  value depends 
on one's purpose, and the precision of one's knowledge. 
Thus, the angular precis ion with which ~r~tly to the ~gM 
i s  def ined var ies with si lverware on the table, chess 
pieces on a board, or houses on a block. 
2.8. CONTRAST 
"Po lar  concepts", i .e. terms like to the ngkG may behave 
l lke imp l i c i t  comparatives. In some sense, to the right is 
bet ter  rea l i zed  the closer the located object is to the 
" r ight  axis". Thus, i f  I said put the ckair to the righ! of tke 
desk, I would expect you to put it more or less on the 
r lght  ax is  of the desk. And, in the f igure below, A ls to 
tAe right of B only in the absence of C. The location of A 
must be contrasted with that of similar objects in the 
re levant  part of space. 
(One could however say here: A ls to the right and behind B, or 
A is ~agonally to the right of B. This suggests that even in 
the presence of C, A is to the algae of B is true, but 
"uncooperat ive"  \[Grice 1974\]. However, It is 
"uncooperative" precisely because of some intrinsic 
proper ty  of the concept to the right - -  l .e. because 
".closer to the axis" is in some sense a better way tO 
rea l i ze  to the right. Even I f  one grants some usefulness to 
the semantic/pragmatic distinction, i t  does not neatly 
apply here.)  
A similar use of contrast  can be seen with the ch.,~r is In 
the corner in the f igure below. I t  is not appropriate 
unless the armchair be removed. 
,@.-.cha i r 
The concept of a "corner" has bu i l t  In that In the corner 
becomes less appropr iate as one gets further from the 
vertex itself, 
2. 9. (~THERS 
Many uses of  the preposit ions cannot be explained in 
terms of any of the above factors.  One then needs a 
descr ip t ion  of the context of use at a rather specif ic  
leve l .  Consider for  example the contexts in which one 
will say Suzy is at the playground versus in the playp'ound. In 
would be ( i )  preferred i f  the  speaker can see Suzy, 
( i l )  required I f  the addressee expects Suzy to be Just 
outs ide  the playground, ( t i t )  required i f  the speaker 
her /h imse l f  Is in the playground (an analogous contrast 
ex i s ts  between at the be~k and on the beach). These 
cond i t ions  "suggest" a close-up view, and that the 
speaker 's  knowledge is precise; by contrast, "at" 
suggests  a remote view, and imprecise knowledge. But 
" to  suggest" is not to imply: one cannot infer these 
cond i t ions  of use from the ideas of a remote versus a 
c lose-up view. 
3. COR~ MEANIN~ 
With most of the examples given, the explanation 
suggested fo r  the choice of a preposition assumes the 
ex is tence  of  a "core meaning". This core meaning is 
bas ica l ly  a geometrical relat ionship between 
geometr ica l  ent i t ies .  Thus, in a given context, 
"geometr i ca l  descr ipt ions"  (say a point, l ine, surface, 
volume, lamina, etc . )  are mapped onto the subject and 
object of the preposition. Strictly speaking, the core 
meanings are -- at best -- true only of these geometric 
descr ip t ions .  In fact ,  they may not even hold for any 
such geometric descr ipt ion - -  see the pear in ? ~ml 
example above, assuming the natural core meaning for 
" lne ,  i .e .  " inc lus ion" .  Yet, the core meaning is then 
present  as "prototype".  
Here are informal de f in i t ions  of the core meanings for  
two categories of prepositions, designated as 
" topo log ica l "  (at. on. in),  and "project ive"  (to the right, 
be~nd, etc . ) .  
Topo log ica l  prepos i t ions:  
in: par t ia l  inc lus ion  of a geometr i ca l  construct in a 
vo lume,  an area ,  or a l ine .  
on: cont igu i ty ,  ad jacency  of a geometr i ca l  const ruct  
w i th  a sur face ,  or a l ine .  
~:  co inc idence  of  a po in t  with a po int  in space. 
In actua l  context ,  inc lus ion,  cont igu i ty ,  and 
co inc idence  need not be true. Thus the book on top of a 
p i le  of  books on the table  can be said on tie ta~e, and 
Mar~ ts eJ the gate when very close to It. But the re la t ions  
represent  the " idea l "  around which par t i cu la r  instances 
grav l ' ta te .  Thus at Impl ies the c losest  reasonable 
re la t ionsh ip  between two objects,  and coincidence where 
sens ib le  (tie cent~oftke drclems attkeint~s~t~onoftke axe).  Of 
course,  the core meanings are not su f f i c ient  to 
determine  the cond i t ions  of use of a given preposi t ion:  
one must a lso  know prec ise ly  which deviat ions from the 
idea l  are permit ted.  One pr inc ipa l  process Jed lat tng 
between core meanings and actual condit ions of use Is 
the  mapping o f  ob jects  onto points,  surfaces, and 
volumes. 
I am not  saying that  the core meanings presented here 
are  the only  poss ib le  ones. Only when core meanings are 
Incorporated  in a global  explanatory system wi l l  I t  be 
poss ib le  to make r igorous arguments for  a l te rnate  
cho ices .  Those proposed here represent a good s tar t ing  
po in t .  
P ro jec t ive  prepos i t ions :  
Each o f  these prepos i t ions  involves - -  through fact ,  
suppos i t ion ,  or metaphor - -  a "po int  of observat ion ' ,  k 
po in t  of  observat ion  consists of two vectors, one 
Ind icat ing  the intrinsic ver t i ca l  of the observer  (it 
wi l l  not  be the grav i ta t iona l  ver t i ca l  I f  the observer 
I s  l y ing  down, or  not In the grav i ta t iona l  f ie ld ) ,  and 
the o ther  orthogonal  to the f i r s t  along the l ine  of 
s ight .  These two vectors completely speci fy four 
cop lanar  or tho$ona l  ha l f - l ine  axes associated with the 
po in t  o f  observat ion :  the " f ront" ,  " r ight" ,  "back", and 
" le f t "  axes ,  in c lockwise  order .  
In the core meaning de f in i t ion  of these preposit ions,  
re fe rence  and located objects  are points.  Given a po int  
o f  observat ion ,  one can speci fy  axes aSSOCiated with 
the re ference  ob ject  - -  the "base axes" ( r ight ,  l e f t ,  
front, and back) by re ference  to which to the ri~w,kt, be~nd, 
etc . ,  w i l l  be def ined.  These axes or ig inate  at the 
re fe rence  ob ject .  If the point  of observation (PObs) 
co inc ides  w i th  the reference object  (PRef) ( f igure A 
be low) ,  the base axes are Ident ica l  to those of  the 
po in t  o f  observat ion .  I f  the point  of observation Is 
away from the reference object  ( f igure B), the base 
axes  are  a mi r ro r  iMge  of those of the po int  of 
observat ion  - -  the  mtzror  p lane being the b i sector  of 
the  segment jo in ing  point of observation to reference 
ob jec t .

There are thus two poss ib le orders of the base axes, as 
shown In A and B. 
I wl l l  def ine  the core meaning of each pro jec t ive  
prepos i t ion  as fo l lows:  given a punctual reference 
ob jec t  (PRef), punctual located object  (PLoc), and a 
po in t  o f  observat ion ,  base axes can be constructed 
accord ing  to the procedure out l ined above: PLoc Is to tie 
left. of  PRef i f f  i t  i s  located  on the le f t  base ax is .  
Analogous d~f in i t ions  for  the other preposit ions are  
easy  to fo rmulate .  
A few examples w i l l  help understand how these co're 
meanings are  man i fes t  in the actua l  uses of the 
prepos i t ions .  
In in fremt of a r~ling st~me, the point of observation Is 
"vlrtual"-- l.e. It Is an hypothetical locatlon and 
direction for vlewlng: the location is coincident with 
the stone,, and the direction Is the direction of 
movement. One must of course assume - -  as with the 
ob jec ts  In tit= examples that fo l low - -  that the stone 
I s  as lmi la ted  to a point. 
In to tie ~gkt of tle char, the base axes may be spec i f ied as 
those in t r ins ic  to the cha i r  -o I .e .  by reference to a 
typ ica l  user.  The point  of observation is then 
co inc ident  w i th  the reference object  o- namely the 
cha i r .  Coincidence may be the case when the base axes 
are  not  In t r ins ic  to the reference object:  for  Instance 
on the ri\[M of the sto0/ lay be def ined with respect to 
somebody s i t t ing  on i t ,  given a round stool with no 
in t r ins ic  f ront  ax is .  
Reference ob jec t  and po int  of observation are separated 
In  the moon ~kind the clou~\[. They can also be separated when 
the  base  axes  are  in t r ins ic  to the re ference  ob jec t :  
wlth on t~ r i \ [kt side of tle closet, the point  of observation Is 
de f ined  by a typ ica l  user facing the c loset .  
Again,  one might def ine  the core meanings d i f fe rent ly .  
In .par t i cu la r  one could def ine  the core meaning of " to  
the  r ight"  say, as implying locat ion  In the whole 
r ight -hand ha l f - space  instead of on the axis. The 
cho ice  adopted here re f lec ts  the fact  noted In ear l ie r  
examples that  the " idea l "  rea l i za t ion  of to the ngkt is 
with the located ob jec t  on the right base axis.  
Processes o ther  than the mapping of objects onto points 
may mediate between core meanings and actual condit ions 
o f  use. The re ference ob ject  amy rotate:  where is on t~e 
right nd, r of the ~nt ing  when the painting is tllted7 Tie tree 
to t ie ri@kt of tie ro(~ actua l ly  means "at  sob  point of the 
road"  - -  th ink  of a curv ing  road) ,  end the ~ ~nd tat 
barbed wirefence assumes " in tegrat ion"  along the length of 
the fence (note one cannot say t /~ty  to tie ntkt o f tke f~ce 
to the Same effect -- that is re fe r r ing  In thls way to 
the whole c i ty .  The l ine  of  s ight  Is a favored axis,  as 
compared to r ight ,  le f t ,  and hack axes). 
4. SOME CONCLUS|( .'S 
Here are the main problels and directions of inquiry 
suggested by the examples in this paper. 
One cannot fu l l y  expla in the use of a locat ive  
pred icat ion  in a given s i tuat ion  in terms of the core 
meanings together  wi th  some inferences from general 
p r inc ip les  invo lv ing  ob ject  knowledge, sal ience, 
re levance ,  the  prec is ion  des i red ,  etc. There w111 
always remain uses involving some degree of 
arbitrariness (most uses are "motivated", I f  not 
"compositional" \[Flllmore Ig?9\] -- i.e. the morphemes 
composing the appropriate expression are normally 
selected from "reasonable" candidates). Even where such 
principles are at play, they may operate not at the 
comprehens ion/product ion  l eve l ,  but ra ther  a t  the 
phy logenet ic  leve l .  To sort pr incipled aspects of use 
from arb i t ra ry  ones, and to understand exactly where 
such pr inc ip les  operate, one must of course f i r s t  
estab l i sh  the i r  existence and nature. 
In te rms  o f  knowledge of the  phys ica l  world, I be l ieve 
one importan~ step. toward adequate representations is 
to  put  the  exper iencer  back into the p icture.  That is ,  
I t  is  not enough - -  or even always necessary - -  to know 
where what objects are; one must also consider how much 
f i t s  in to  one f ie ld  of view, how th ings "appear" as 
opposed, to how they "are",  how this changes with 
viewing distance, v i s ib i l i ty ,  obstruction, etc. 
General p r inc ip les  of salience should ue studied: how 
some ob ject  parts or re lat ions  are selected as most 
important  - -  e i ther  in a l l  imaginable contexts, or in 
some contexts .  Salience underlies many Instances of 
metonymy (in at t~e front of tAe t~atre, "theatre" actua l ly  
re fe rs  to the part  occupied by the audience). 
Many'quest ions revolve around the issue of "relevance" 
- -  of "what matters, to whom, in what circumstances" 
ra ther  than the t rad i t iona l  concern with what is true. 
A l l  ex i s t ing  ar t i f i c ia l  Inte l l igence programs have 
ignored th i s  problem by using a l imited vocabulary In a 
l im i ted  domain, so that the question of selecting 
re levant  utterances never arises. 
Relevance is l inked to the speaker's purpose, as uny  
o f  the contextual  factors  described in this paper - -  
indeterminacy,  Gricean inferences, highl ighting of 
background elements, determination of the Figure/Ground 
re la t ionsh ip ,  etc. The set of "expressible" 8oals is 
const ra ined  by the "potent ia l "  of the language, i .e .  by 
a semantic system with f in i te ly  many options. One can 
only  want to say what can be said, and said in a 
reasonab le  amount of time. Clear ly ,  "planning" for 
natura l  language process ing  is  a very Important 
problem.  
Purpose however, w i l l  not explain everything one says. 
Simple assoc ia t ive  mechanisms must sometimes be 
respons ib le  for  what one says. For instance, some 
background element may be highlighted - -  provided Some 
l inguist ic  means to do so exists  - -  only because some 
passive assoc ia t ive  l ink has brought i t  to attent ion.  
Once general pr inc ip les  are better understood, I t  Is an 
open quest ion whether they are used by speakers, or 
whether the i r  explanatory power Is at the phyiogenettc 
leve l  (and w i l l  thus be only Impl ic i t  in the structure 
o f  the knowledge representation).  For instance, 
a l though there is a general pr inc io le  that  the located 
ob jec t  should be more mobile than the reference object, 
product ion may not proceed by inferences from this  
general  p r inc ip le  together with scenarios Involving the 
two objects .  The l ingu is t i c  expression (or pattern for 
expressions)  may be attached to some representation of 
a "s i tuat ion  type" invo lv ing  the two objects (or two 
superord inate  objects) .  And although "at" generally 
impl ies  the c losest  reasonable relat ionship between two 
ob jec ts ,  such a de f in i t ion  may never be used by a 
speaker - -  or used only In the creation or 
understanding of novel types of expressions, metaphors, 
w i t t i c i sms ,  etc. 
What speakers do, and what conputer models of 
comprehension and production processes should be made 
to do, are two d i f fe rent  things: the la t te r  depends on 
the const ructer ' s  goals, which should be subjected to 
some scrut iny .  
A computational treatment of the use of prepositions 
w i l l  require much greater sophist icat ion than naive 
representat ion  theory would lead us to expect.
