2 L ingu is t i c  p roper t ies  of  re lat ional  
ad ject ives  
Ac(:ording to linguistic and gralnlnaticM tradi- 
tion, there are two nlain categories aUlOllg adjec- 
tives: el)ithetic slM1 as important (,sign'~ificant) 
and relatio11M adjectives uch as laitier Malty). 
The tirst ones cannot \]l~ve an ~gentive interl)re- 
215 
ration in contrast to the second: tile adjective 
laiticr (dairy) within the uoun phrase pr'oduc- 
lion laiti~re (dairy production) is an argument 
to the predicative noun production (production) 
and this is not the case fbr the adjective impof 
tant (significant) within the phrase production 
importante (significant production). Relation- 
al adjectives (RAdj) possess the following well- 
known linguistic properties: 
? they are either denonfinal adjectives - -  
morphologically derived from a noun 
thanks to suttix--, or adjectives having a 
noun usage such as mathdmatique (math- 
cmatical/mathcmatics). For the former, 
not all the adjective-tbrming sufiqxes lead 
to relational adjectives. The following suf- 
tixes are considered by (Dubois, 1962) as 
appropriate:-ain, -air'e, -al, -el, -estr'c, 
ien,-icr',-il(e),-in,-ique. However, (Guy- 
on, 1993) remarks that a suffix, even 
the most appropriate, is never necessary 
nor sufficient. Several adjectives carry- 
ing a favorable suffix are not relationah 
this is the case with the adjectives ending 
with -iquc (-ic), which characterize chem- 
istry and which are not derived from a 
noun, such as ddsox!/ribonucldique (deoryri- 
bonucleic), dodecanoiquc Modecanoic), etc. 
Other suffixes inappropriate are sometimes 
used such as the suffixes -d and -e'a:~:: car- 
bone &,'bon) -* car'bon~J (~.a,'bo,,,,eeo'a,~), 
c,,,,ce," #a,,,cer9 + ca,~c~r'e'a:~ &ancc','o'~,~), 
etc. 
? they own tile possibility, in special condi- 
tions, of replacing tile attributiw'~ use of 
a corresponding prepositional phrase. The 
preposition employed, as well as tile pres- 
ence or not of a deternfiner, depends on the 
head noun of the noun phrase: 
aciditd sanguine (blood acidity) ~_ aciditd 
du sang (acidity of the blood) 
conqugtc spatiale (space conquest) ~_ con- 
qu~tc de l'espace (conquest of space) 
ddbit horairc (hourly rate) ~- ddbit par' 
heure (rate per" h, our) 
cxpdrimentations animales (animal experi- 
mentation) ~ cxpdrimcntations sur lea an- 
imaux (experimentation on animals) 
? and several other properties uch the im- 
possibility of a predicative position, the ill- 
compatibility with a degree modification, 
etc. 
3 Morphological Rule I nduct ion  
~lb identify RAdj trough a term extractor, we 
use their paraphrastic property which inchldes 
the morphological property, the morl)hological 
property being insufficient alone. We need rules 
to recover the lemma of the noun fl'om which the 
lemma of the RAdj has been derived. 
These rules tbllow the tbllowing schemata: 
r~ = \[-S +M \]{exceptions} where: 
S is the relational suffix to be deleted from the 
end of an adjective. The result of this dele- 
tion is the stem R; 
M is the mutative segment o be concatenated 
to R in order to tbrm a noun; 
except ions  list the adjectives that should not 
be submitted to this rule. 
For example, the rule \[-d -l-e \]{agd} says that 
if there is an adjective which ends with d, we 
should strip this ending from it and append tile 
string c to tile stem except if this a4jective be- 
longs to tile list of exceptions, namely agd. 
We extract these mort)hological rules Kom 
the corpora following the method presented in 
(Mikheev, 1997) with the difl'erenee that we 
don't limit the length of the mutative segmen- 
t. The relational suffixes are known, only the 
nmtative segments have to be guessed. For tlm 
lemma of an adjective ending with a relational 
suffix in the corpus Adji, we strip this suffix of 
Adji and store the resulting stem ill R. Then, 
wc try to segment this stein R to each noun 
Nounj at)pearing in the corpus. If the subtrac- 
tion result in all non-empty string, the system 
creates a morphological rule where tile muta- 
tive segment is tile result of the subtraction of 
R to Nounj. We thus obtained couples (Ad.ii, 
Nounj) associated to a morphological rule. For 
example: (gazeux, gaz) \[-cux +""\]. 
This schemata doesn't take into account stem 
alternants uch as: 
el6 alphabe t/ aph, abd t-ique 
~/~ hygi~ ne/hygidn-ique 
e/ i  polle n/polli n-ique 
x /c  th, orux / thorac-ique 
216 
In order to h~mdle this alh)mort)hy, we, use the 
Lcvenshtein's weighted distance (l ,cvenshtcin, 
1.966) which determines the min imum numl)e,r of 
insertions or deletions of characters to transfor- 
m one word into another. (Wagner and Fisher, 
1974) presents  n re(:nrsive ~dgorithm to (:ah:ulate 
this dist~mcc. 
? ! 
&.s t ('w ~,i, 'w~ ,j ) = 
min(di.st (w~ ,i-~, ""~ ,j) + q,

we add the constraint hat l/. ~m(1 the n(mn must

rel;~fin cout)les comi)oscd of ml ~uljectivc and a

1)re('iscly, we (:onsidcr theft such suffixes are, al- 
lomorphic w~rbmts of the relation suffixes. Wc 
also add new mort)hok)gic;d ruh',s. For cxam- 
ple, for the couple (hygi&t,c, hygidniquc,), we add 
the suffix -~niquc which is conside, red as an al- 
lomorph of the sutfix -iquc, mid creatc tim rule:

Noun1 5_ V in f  v iandes  ~t 9riller (grill meat) 
These base structures are not frozen structures 
and do accept several variations. Those which 
are taken into account are: 
1. Inflexional and Internal morphosyntactic 
variants: 
? graphic and orthographic variants 
which gather together predictable in- 
flexional variants: conservation de 
p~vduit (product preservation), conser- 
vations de p'rvduit (product preserva- 
tions), or not: conservation dc prod'ait- 
s (products preservation) and ease d i f  
ferences. 
? variations of the preposition: eh, w- 
matographie en colonne (column 
chrwnatography), chromatographic sur 
colonne (chrvmatograph, y on col'area); 
? optional character of the preposition 
and of the z~rticle: fixation azote (hi- 
trogen fization), fixation d'azote (fiz- 
ation of nitrogen), fi.~:ation de l~azote 
(fization of the nitrogen); 
2. Intermfl modification variants: insertion in- 
side the base-term structure of a modifi- 
er such as the adjective inside the Noun1 
(Prep (Det)) Nom~2 structure: lair de bre- 
bis (goat's milk), lait cru de brebis (milk 
straigh, t .from the goat); 
3. Coordinational w~riants: coordination of 
base term structures: alimentation hu- 
maine (human diet), alimentation animale 
et hnmaine (human and animal diet); 
4. Predicative variants: the predicative role of 
the adjective: peetinc mdthylgc (mcthylate 
pectin), cos pectines ont m6thyldes (these 
pectins are metylated). 
The corpus is tagged and lemmatized. The pro- 
gram scans the corpus, counts and extracts col- 
locations whose syntax characterizes base-terms 
or one of their variants. This is done with shal- 
low parsing using local grammars based on reg- 
ular expressions (Basili et al, 1993). These 
grammars use the morphosyntactie information 
associated with the words of the corpus by the 
tagger. The different occurrences are grouped 
as pairs formed by lemmas of the candidate ter- 
m and sorted following an association measure 
which takes into account the frequence of the 
COOCCtlrrOllCeS. 
4.2 Term Ext rac tor  mod i f i ca t ions  
The identilication of relational adjective takes 
place afl;er extraction of the occurrences of the 
candidate terms and their syntactic variation- 
s. The algorithm below resmnes the successive 
steps tbr identifying relational adjectives: 
1. Examine ach candidate of Noun Adj struc- 
ture; 
2. Apply a transtbrmational rule in order 
to generate all the possible corresponding 
base nouns. We added morphosyntactie 
constraints for some suffixes, such as tbr 
the suffix -er, that the identitied adjective 
is not a past-participle; 
3. Search the set of candidate terms tbr a pair 
formed with Nomtl (identical between a 
Noun1 (Prep (l)?t)) Nou,~2 and a Noun1 
Adj structures) and Noun2 generated from 
step 2. 
4. If step 3 succeeds, group the two base struc- 
tures mlcter a new candidate term. Take 
out all the Noun Adj structures owing this 
adjective from the set; of Noun Adj candi- 
dates and rename them as a Nomt RAdj 
structure. 
I11 Step 2, morl)hoh)gical rules generate one or 
several nouns tbr a given adjective. We gener- 
ate a notllt for each relational suffix class. A 
class of suffixes includes the allomorphic vari- 
ants. This overgeneration method used in in- 
forlnation retrieval by (aacquemin and Tzouk- 
ermann, 1999) gives low noise because the base 
noun must not only be an attested for in the 
corpus, but must also appear as an extension of 
a head noun. For exanti)le, with the adjective 
ioniqne (ionic), we generate both ionic ('ionia) 
and ion (ion), but only ion (ion) is an attested 
tbrm; with the adjective gazeux (gaseous), the 
noun forms gaz #as) and gaze #auze); are gen- 
erated and the two of them are attested; but, 
the adjective gazeux (gaseous) appears with the

bank), c'alt'a,'e de ecUules (e~tlt~u'e of cells). 
C A the number of candidate terms of Noun 
RAdj structure. For example, CA=61 for 
the adjective celluIaire (cellular) because it 
appears in 61candidate terms such as acidc 
cellulaire (cellular acid), activitd cell'alaire 
(cclluhtr activity), agr@at cell'ulaire (ccll'a- 
la'r aggregate). 
C N the munber of candidate terms of Noun1 
Prep (Det) NounltAd j structure.  For exam- 
ple CN=58 tbr the noun eellule (cell) be- 
cause it appears in 58 candidate terms such 
as ADN de cellule &ell DNA), addition de 
cellules (cell addition). 
Then, tbr each candidate term of CA and CN, 
we checked tbr their presence in AGROVOC. 
Tile only matches that we have accepted are 
exact matches. With this comparison, we ob- 
tained the following indexes: 
a the number of candidate terms of Noun RAdj 
structure tbund in AGR.OVOC under the 
Noun RAdj structure. 
b the number of candidate terms of Noun RAdj 
structure tbund in AGROVOC muler the 
Nounl Prep (Det) NounlIAdj structure.

Figure 3: Averages of precisions and recalls 
c the number of candidate l;erms of Nounl 
Prep (Det) Nounl~Adj structure found in A- 
GROVOC under the Noun RAdj structure. 
d the number of candidate terms of Nounl. 
Prep (Det) Noun~Adj structure found in 
AGROVOC under the Noun1 Prep (Det) 
NounRAdj structure. 
These indexes allow us to compute precision 
P and recall R for each Noun RAdj structure 
and each Noun1 Prep (Det) Noun~Adj structure 
with the help of the fbllowing tbrmula: 
((,, + b) 
I'No~,~A~j -- C~ (1) 
+ d) (2) 
aNounPrep(Del.)Nounl~A,lj -- CN 
(a + t,) (3) ~NounRAdj  -- TA 
(c +d) 
l~,Nounl)rep(Det)Nounl?A4i -- TAr (4) 
The averages of precision and recall for the t- 
wo structures are summarized in table 3. This 
comparison of the average of precision comput- 
ed shows that candidate terms with a Noun 
RAdj structure are 10 times more likely to be 
terms than their eqniwflent in Nounl Prep (De- 
t) Nounl~.Adj. The analysis of the average of re- 
call is also impressive: it is generally difficult to 
obtain a recall sut)erior to 25 % when comparing 
candidate terms extracted from a corpus and 
a thesaurus of the same domain (Daille et el., 
1998). The average of recalls obtained thanks 
to the identification of RAdj shows that nearly 
half of the terms lmilt with the defined RAdj are 
identified. These good wflues of precision and 
recall have been obtained on linguistic criteria 
only without taking into account frequency.
