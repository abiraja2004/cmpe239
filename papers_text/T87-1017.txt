As far as I can tell the most exciting thing happening in AI these days is the inva- 
sion of the brain people (a.k.a. the connectionists). The connectionists haven't really 
invaded the AI community in the sense of making a planned assault - it just seems 
that connectionism is the sexiest hing around. The AI community has very suddenly 
become very interested in connectionist techniques and it is only a slight exaggera- 
tion for me to say thai all the first year graduate students I meet express an interest 
in connectionism. So perhaps it would be useful to talk about the status of connec- 
tionism with respect o the old formal/commonsense semantic arguments. Let's try to 
pigeon-hole this new paradigm in terms of our old formal/procedural/episodic/semantic 
distinctions and see what happens. 
1. What About Symbols? 
The first thing we have to grapple with is the fact that the connectionists are operat- 
ing within a sphere of assumptions that is problematic to mainstream AI research. The 
cornerstone of mainstream AI is the idea of symbol manipulation. Interestingly, many 
of the most exciting efforts in connectionism {the "Parallel Distributed Processing" 
(PDP) models described by Rumelhart & McClelland (1986)) do not utilize explicit 
symbols at all. But this does not prevent PDP systems from manipulating informa- 
tion: it just means that a concept in a PDP system is not present in that system as 
an explicit data structure. Concepts (and attributes and categories) manifest hem- 
selves as patterns of activation distributed throughout a strongly connected network 
of nodes, where the nodes ~by themselves signify nothing in particular. Distributed 
representations of this sort can be manipulated to exhibit useful I /O behavior, but our 
traditional ideas of data and control fail to provide the descriptive framework needed 
to understand these systems. 
The implications of this are important. In mainstream AI, a successful system 
can be said to embody a theor~ of human information processing. But this claim is 
evaluated on the basis of what we understand about that program. An explanation at 
the level of machine code is not very useful, but a high level flow chart might be. The 
PDP systems do not lend themselves to this explanatory aspect of AI very readily.

"The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not 
lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation i  a conven- 
tional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the 
processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements." 
(Hinton, McClelland, Rumelhart 1986). 
In some sense, the task of understanding how a given PDP system works is very 
much like trying to understand machine code. This should not be surprising, given 
the intimacy of PDP models with low-level computing mechanisms, but it does tend 
to alienate those elements of the AI community who are interested in "understanding" 
their programs in traditional information processing terms. It is no small accomplish- 
ment to stop thinking in terms of primitive symbols, data structures, and procedures, 
in order to start thinking in terms of input vectors, linear thresholds, and necessary 
conditions for stabilization. 
While the presence or absence of explicit symbols may at first seem to be an in- 
surmountable hurdle to any intelligent comparisons between AI and connectionism, it 
is sobering to consider what the connectionists have accomplished using distributed 
representations. Connectionists have traditionally looked at "low-level"" information 
processing problems: motor feedback, stereoscopic vision processing, visual letter recog- 
nition, and lexical access for natural anguage are typical examples. If the AI commu- 
nity has been slow to embrace the lessons of connectionism, it is "because mainstream 
AI is more concerned with "high-level" information processing: text comprehension, 
problem solving, scene recognition, and inductive learning are closer to the heart of 
mainstream AI. But now we are beginning to see connectionism "trickle-up" into higher 
task orientations. 
Connectionist systems are now being designed to: 
1. Translate sentences into case-frame representations 
(McClelland & Kawamoto 1986) 
2. Index causal chains for narrative recall 
(Golden 1986) 
3. Handle the script activation problem 
(Sharkey, Sutcliffe, and Wobcke 1986) 
4. Index memory for a case-based reasoner 
(Stanfill & Waltz 1986) 
5. Store and retrieve relational data 
(Hinton 1986) 
81 
These tasks are firmly situated in the realms of "high-level" information processing 
- or at least they used to be. No one is claiming to have solved these problems, but 
one cannot resist the feeling that a breath of fresh air is clearing a musty old closet. 
2. The TWITIT Methodology 
Connectionists are generally attentive to the physical properties and limitations of 
the human brain. At the same time, they experiment with programmable systems and 
bend an occasional constraint as needed. They are exploiting an interesting mix of 
science (brain theory) and engineering (TWeak It Til It Thinks). On the one hand, 
connectionists are more constrained than traditional AI researchers: AI people do not 
think in terms of hardware constraints. On the other hand, connectionists have no 
shame when it comes to actually making something work: The business of finding a 
correct set of weights (or initial values, or network architecture, or whatever) is closer 
to the Quest for the Holy Grail than any knowledge ngineer has cared to go. The AI 
community became understandably nervous about the TWlTIT paradigm for system 
design shortly after Samuel's checkers playing system failed to extrapolate up to chess. 
I suppose we never quite got over that one. 
Even so, as far as methodological styles go, the connectionist enterprise seems capa- 
ble of accommodating both "neats" and "scruffies" (Abelson 1981). The neat AI camp 
can optimize learning rules, establish tests for Boltzmann-equivalence," andworry about 
decidability as a problem in linear algebra. While all this is going on, the scruffies can 
revel in the pursuit of graceful degradation, operate on the basis of elusive concept def- 
initions, and learn from experience. Wherever the chips may fall, it is nevertheless true 
that the connectionist turf is up for grabs in the mainstream AI community. What 
is the relationship between formal logic and connectionism? Theories of reminding 
and connectionism? Opportunistic planning and connectionism? Teams are just now 
forming and the sides are still being chosen. 
3. A ROSE is a ROZE is a ROZ is a WOZ 
Having said all that, maybe we can now try to say something about our original topic 
of discussion: how the connectionists weigh in on the formal/procedural/episodic/semantic 
scales. 
To begin, let's consider the problem of representing word meanings. In traditional 
AI there are basically two competing approaches to the representation f word mean- 
ings. (1) The formalist fans assume a componential view in which a word's meaning 
is represented by a set of semantic features. (2) The episodic enthusiasts assume a 
82 
structuralist position in which the meaning of word must be defined in terms of its 
relationship to other words and available memory structures. Interestingly, there are 
PDP models inspired by both viewpoints (Hinton, McClelland, and Rumelhart 1986) 
describe componential systems, while (McClelland and Kawamoto 1986) discuss truc- 
turalist PDP systems. ~
If we look a bit closer at the PDP models for lexical access, we discover that they are 
governed by remarkably predictable task orientations. The componential systems are 
all concerned with the problem of mapping single isolated words to their word senses, 
while the structuralist systems are all trying to resolve word senses during sentence 
comprehension. Plus ca qhange... 
On the surface, at least, it seems that connectionist techniques can be applied to 
any traditional view one wants to promote. But there are some undercurrents afoot 
that might tip the balance away from a fully neutral position of non-alignment. The 
undercurrent to watch is the question of learning. 
One of the reasons why connectionists (at least the PDP variety) are preoccupied 
with learning is because they see no other systematic way to approach the design of 
large (at least 100,000 nodes) networks which cannot be understood as static data 
structures. Coincidentally, a similar preoccupation with learning has risen in recent 
years among the proponents of episodic memory. It is easy to build a limited prototype 
that illustrates the utility of episodic memory structures - but it is much harder to scale 
up from that to a practical system which utilizes a lot of episodic knowledge ffectively. 
This parallel is at least suggestive ofsome common ground, although the lisp-lovers and 
the TWITIT set will have to stretch considerably in bringing their respective method- 
ologies together. I think it will happen. The episodic camp is populated primarily by 
closet psychologists, and the TWITIT group seems to be dominated by closet neurolo- 
gists. Whatever other differences exist, both groups build systems in order to test their 
theories and this requires a healthy respect for engineering. The engineering compo- 
nents of both groups are sufficiently simpatico to encourage a few curious adventurers 
into crossing over. 
The formalists operate with a very different methodological style, one that is domi- 
nated by a much more philosophical orientation. The formalists prefer to study knowl- 
edge in a competence framework rather than a performance framework. This is the 
study of knowledge as it might be if we could factor out the imperfections of the hu- 
A number of research efforts which qualify as connectionist efforts are not PDP systems ince they 
employ "local" representations rather than "distributed" representations. The work of Small, Cotrell & 
Small, Waltz & Pollack, and Charniak fall into this category.

man mind that conceives it. Never mind the fact that "Three dogs ate four bones" is 
problematic only for graduate students - these are the problems we can study without 
reference to performance criteria or subject data or anything else that relies on a con- 
cern for human memory organization. References to "semantic memory" confuse the 
issue (as do those who take formal semantics seriously as a model of human memory), 
but the difference in methodological styles is obvious. 2 
The advocates of semantic features, quantification, and intension/intention distinc- 
tions, are almost never people who design psychological experiments or worry about 
models of human information processing as a precursor to intelligent information pro- 
cessing. 
Given all this, it seems to me that the formalists will be even more uncomfortable 
with the TWITIT mentality than they were with the old-style scrutfies. Of course there 
will always be room for people who want to nail down optimal annealing schedules 
and mathematical foundations. So the job prospects for formalists look healthy if the 
connectionists stage a complete takeover of AI in the next decade. As for the scruffy AI 
types, it seems that the future depends on whether one is primarily a closet psychologist 
or a latent engineer. The engineers will undoubtedly find work in the brave new world 
(they always do), but the closet psychologists will be interesting to watch. They will 
either retreat with queasy feelings of paradigm failure, or stage a revolution that's 
tough to call. If the connectionists should ever come to dominate AI, we will have to 
deal with the very real possibility that we might be able to simulate something without 
really understanding it very well at all. But that's another panel discussion altogether.
