Methods of text compression in Navy messages are 
not limited to sentence fragments and the omissions of 
function words such as the copula be. Text compression 
is also exhibited within ~grammatieal" sentences and is 
identified within noun phrases in Navy messages. 
Mechanisms of text compression include increased fre- 
quency of complex noun sequences and also increased 
usage of nominalizations. Semantic relationships among 
elements of a complex noun sequence can be used to 
derive a correct bracketing of syntactic onstructions. 
I INTRODUCTION 
At the Navy Center for Applied Research in 
Artificial Intelligence, we have begun computer-analyzing 
and processing the compact text in Navy equipment 
failure messages, specifically equipment failure messages 
about electronics and data communications systems. 
These messages are required to be sent within 24 hours of 
the equipment casualty. Narrative remarks are restricted 
to a length of no more than 99 lines, and each line is res- 
tricted to a length of no more than 69 characters. 
Because hundreds of these messages are sent daily to 
update ship readiness data bases, automatic procedures 
are being implemented to handle them efficiently. Our 
task has been to process them for purposes of dissemina- 
tion and summarization, and we have developed a proto- 
type system for this purpose. To capture the information 
in the narrative, we have chosen to use natural language 
understanding techniques developed at the Linguistic 
String Project \[Sager 1981\]. 
These messages, like medical reports \[Marsh 1982\] 
and technical manuals \[Lehrberger 1982\], exhibit proper- 
ties of text compression, in part due to imposed time and 
length constraints. Some methods of compression result 
in sentences that are usually called ill-formed in normal 
English texts \[Eastman 1981\]. Although unusual in nor- 
mal, full English texts, these are characteristic of mes- 
sages. Recent work on these properties' include discus- 
sions of omissions of function words such as the copula 
be, which results in sentence fragments and omissions of 
articles in compact text \[Marsh 1982, 1983; Bachenko 
1983\]. However, compact ext also utilizes mechanisms of
compression that are present in normal English but are 
used with greater frequency in messages and technical 
reports. Although the messages contain sentence frag- 
ments, they also contain many complete sentences. 
These sentences are long and complicated in spite of the 
telegraphic style often used. The internal structure of 
noun phrases in these constructions i often quite com- 
plex, and it is in these noun phrases that we find syntac- 
tic constructions characteristic of text compression. Simi- 
lar properties have been noted in other report sub- 
languages \[Lehrberger, 1982; Levi, 1978\]. 
When processing these messages it becomes impor- 
tant to recognize signs of text compression since the func- 
tion words that so often direct a parsing procedure and 
reduce the choice of possible constructions are frequently 
absent. Without these overt markers of phrase boun- 
daries, straightforward parsing becomes difficult and 
structural ambiguity becomes a serious problem. For 
example, sentences (1)-(2) are superficially identical, how- 
ever in Navy messages, the first is a request for a part (an 
antenna) and the second a sentence fragment specifying 
an antenna performing a specific function. (a transmit 
antenna). 
(1) Request antenna shipped by fastest available means. 
(2) Transmit antenna shipped by fastest available 
means. 
The question arises of how to recognize and capture these 
distinctions. We have chosen to take a sublangnage, or 
domain specific, approach to achieving correct parses by 
specifying the types of possible combinations among ele- 
ments of a construction in both structural and semantic 
terms. 
This paper discusses a method for recognizing 
instances of textual compression and identifies two types 
of textual compression that arise in standard and sub- 
language texts: complex noun sequences and nominaliza- 
tions. These are both typically found in noun phrase 
constructions. We propose a set of semantic relations for 
complex noun sequences, within a sublanguage analysis, 
that permits the proper bracketing of modifier and host 
for correct interpretation of noun phrases. 
II TEXT COMPRESSION IN NOUN PHRASES 
We can recognize the sources of text compression by 
two means: (1) comparing a full grammar of the standard 
language to that of the domain in which we are working, 
505 
and {2) comparing the distribution of constructions in 
two different sublanguages. The first comparison distin- 
guishes those constructions that are peculiar to a sub- 
language /el. Marsh 1982\]. A comparison of a full gram- 
mar with two sublanguage grammars, the equipment 
failure messages discussed here and a set of patient medi- 
cal histories, disclosed that the sublanguage grammars 
were substantially smaller than full English grammars, 
having fewer productions and reflecting a more limited 
range of modifiers and complements \[Grishman 1984\]. 
The second comparison identifies the types of construc- 
tions that exhibit text compression. These are common 
even in full sentences. For example, we found that simi- 
lar sets of modifiers were used in the two different sub- 
languages \[Grishman 1984\]. However, the equipment 
failure messages had significantly more left and right 
modifier constructions than the medical, even though the 
equipment failure messages had about one-half the 
number of sentences of the patient histories. 236 sen- 
tences in the medical domain were analyzed and 123 in 
the Navy domain. The statistics are presented in Tables 
1 and 2. 
In particular, there were significantly more noun 
modifiers of nouns constructions (Noun + Noun construc- 
tions) in the equipment failure messages than there were 
in the medical records, and more prepositional phrase 
modifiers of noun phrases. Further analysis suggested 
these constructions are symptomatic of two major 
mechanisms text compression i Navy messages: of com- 
plex noun sequences and nominalizations. 
Complex noun sequences. A major feature of noun 
phrases in this set of messages i the presence of many 
long sequences of left modifiers of nouns, (3). 
{3) (a) forward kingpost sliding padeye unit 
(b) coupler controller standby light 
(c) base plate insulator welds 
{d) recorder-reproducer tape transport 
(e) nbsv or ship-shore tty sat communications 
(f) fuze setter extend/retract ycle 
Complex noun sequences like these can cause major prob- 
lems in processing, since the proper bracketing requires 
an understanding of the semantic/syntactic relations 
between the components. \[Lehrberger 1982\] identifies 
similar sequences (empilage) in technical manuals. As he 
notes, this results from having to give highly descriptive 
names to parts in terms of their function and relation to 
other parts.

the sublanguage of Navy messages, unmarked verb 
modifiers of nouns also occur. This construction is not 
common in standard English or in the medical record 
sublanguage mentioned above. It is illustrated above in 
(2) and below in (4). 
(4) (a) receive sensitivity 
(b) operate mode 
(c) transmit antenna 
Because the verbs are unmarked for tense or aspect, they 
can be mistaken by the parsing procedure for imperative 
or present ense verbs. Furthermore, in this domain the 
problem is compounded by the frequent use of sentence 
fragments consisting of a verb and its object, with no 
subject present (1) repeated as (5) below. 
(5) Request antenna... 
Complex noun sequences also commonly arise from 
the omission of prepositions from prepositional phrases. 
The resulting long sequences of nouns are not easily 
bracketed correctly. In this data set, the omission of 
prepositions is restricted to place and time sequences (6- 
7). 
(6) Request NAVSTA Guantanamo Bay Cuba coordi- 
nate ... 
Request RSG Mayport arrange .... 
(7) Original antenna replaced by outside contractor 
through RSG Mayport 7 JUN 82. 
In (6), prepositions marking time phrases have been omit- 
ted, and in (7) both time and place prepositions have 
been omitted. 
Nominalizations. The increased frequency of preposi- 
tional modifiers in the equipment failure messages was 
traced to the frequent use of nominalizations in Navy 
messages. Out of a preliminary set of 89 prepositional 
modifiers of nouns, 42 were identified as arguments to 
nominalized verbs (47%), the other 52% were attributive. 
Examples of argument prepositional phrases are given in 
(8), attributive in (9). 
(8) (a) assistance from MOTU 12 
(b) failure of amplifier 
(c) cause of casualty 
(d) completion of assistance 
(9) (a) short circuit between amplifier and power supply 
(b) short in cable 
(c) receipt NLT 4 OCT 82 
(d) burned spots on connector 
In these texts, in which nominalization serves as an 
important mechanism of text compression, it therefore 
becomes important to distinguish prepositional phrases 
that serve as arguments of nominalizations from 
attributive ones. 
The syntax of complex modifier sequences in noun 
phrases and the identification of nominalizations, both 
characteristic of text compression, eed to be consistently 
defined f~,~ ~ r)roper understanding of the text being pro- 
cessed. By utilizing the semantic patterns that are 
derived from a sublanguage analysis, it becomes possible 
to properly bracket complex noun phrases. This is the 
subject of the next section. 
HI SEMANTIC PATTERNS IN 
COMPLEX NOUN SEQUENCES 
Noun phrases in the equipment failure messages typ- 
ically include numerous adjectival and noun modifiers on 
the head, and additional modifier types that are not so 
common in general English. The relationships expressed 
by this stacking are correspondingly complex. The 
sequences are highly descriptive, naming parts in terms of 
their function and relation to other parts, and also 
describing the status of parts and other objects in the 
sublanguage. Domain specific information can be used to 
derive the proper bracketing, but it is first necessary to 
identify the modifier-host semantic patterns through a 
distributional analysis of the texts. The basis for sub- 
language work is that the semantic patterns are a res- 
tricted, limited set. They talk about a limited number of 
classes and objects and express a limited number of rela- 
tionships among these objects. These objects and rela- 
tionships are derived through distributional analysis, and 
can ultimately be used to direct the parsing procedure. 
Complex noun sequences. Semantic patterns in complex 
noun phrases fall into two types: part names and other 
noun phrases. Names for pieces of equipment often con- 
tain complex noun sequences, i.e. stacked nouns. The 
relationships among the modifiers in the part names may 
indicate one of several semantic relations. They may 
indicate the levels of components. For example, 
assembly/component relationships are expressed. In cir- 
cuit diode, diode is a component of a circuit. In antenna 
coupler, coupler is a component part of an antenna. Part 
names may also describe the function of the piece of 
equipment. For example, in the phrase high frequency 
transmit antenna, trqlnsmit is the function of the antenna. 
The semantic relations among the modifiers of a part are 
strictly ordered are shown in (10a); examples are provided 
in (10b). 
(10) (a) ID REPAIR SIGNAL FUNCTION PART. 
(b) CU-t~O07 antenna coupler; HF XMIT antenna; 
deflection amplifier; UYA. 4 display system; primary 
HF receive antenna 
The component relations in part names are especially 
closely bound and are best regarded as a unit for process- 
ing. Thus antenna coupler in CU-~O07 antenna coupler 
can be considered a unit. We would not expect to find 
antenna CU-~O07 coupler or coupler CU-~007 antenna. 
In other noun phrases, i.e. those that are not part 
names, the head nouns can have other semantic 
categories. For example, looking back at the sentences in 
(3), the head noun of a noun sequence can be an equip- 
ment part ( unit, light ), a process that is performed on 
electrical signals ( cycle ), a part function (communica- 
507 
tions ). In addition, it can be a repair action (alignment, 
repair), an assistance actions ( assistance ), and so on. 
Only modifiers with appropriate semantic and syntactic 
category can be adjoined. For example, in the phrase fuze 
setter eztend/retract ycle, semantic information is neces- 
sary to attain the correct bracketing. Since only function 
verbs can serve as noun modifiers, eztend/retraet can be 
analyzed as a modifier of cycle, a process word. Fuze 
setter, a part name, can be treated as a unit because 
noun sequences consisting of part names are generally 
local in nature. Fuze setter is prohibited from modifying 
eztend/retract, since verb modifiers do not themselves 
take noun modifiers. 
Other problems, such as the omissions of preposi- 
tions resulting in long noun sequences (ef. (8) and (0) 
above), can also be treated in this manner. By identify- 
ing the semantic lasses of the noun in the object of the 
prepositionless prepositional phrase and its host's class, 
the occurrence of these prepositionless phrases can he res- 
tricted. The date and place strings can then be properly 
treated as a modifier constructions instead as head nouns. 
IV CONCLUSION 
Methods of text compression are not limited to omis- 
sions of lexical items. They also include mechanisms for 
maximizing the amount of information that can he 
expressed within a limited time and space. These 
mechanisms include increased frequency of complex noun 
sequences and also increased usage of nominalizations. 
We would expect o find similar methods of text compres- 
sion in other types of scientific material and message 
traffic. The semantic relationships among the elements of 
a noun phrase permit the proper bracketing of complex 
noun sequences. These relationships are largely domain 
specific, although some patterns may be generalizable 
across domains \[Marsh 1084 I.
The approach taken here for Navy messages, which 
uses suhlanguage s leetional patterns for disambiguation, 
was developed, esigned, and implemented initially at the 
New York University Linguistic String Project for medi- 
cal record processing \[Friedman 1984; Grishman 1983; 
Hirschman 1982 I. It was implemented with the capability 
for transfer to other domains. We anticipate using a 
similar mechanism, based partially on the analysis 
presented here, on Navy messages in the near future.
