Abstract
This paper describes the results of cor-
pus and experimental investigation into
the factors that affect the way clarifica-
tion questions in dialogue are interpreted,
and the way they are responded to. We
present some results from an investigation
using the BNC which show some general
correlations between clarification request
type, likelihood of answering, answer type
and distance between question and an-
swer. We then describe a new experi-
mental technique for integrating manip-
ulations into text-based synchronous dia-
logue, and give more specific results con-
cerning the effect of word category and
level of grounding on interpretation and
response type.
1 Introduction
Requesting clarification is a vital part of the com-
municative process and has received attention from
both the formal semantic (Ginzburg and Cooper,
2001; Ginzburg and Cooper, forthcoming) and con-
versation analytic traditions (Schegloff, 1987), but
little in the computational dialogue system commu-
nity. In theory, a perfect dialogue system should be
able to interpret and deal with clarification requests
(CRs) made by the user in order to elicit clarifica-
tion of some part of a system utterance, and be able
to request clarification itelf of some part of a user ut-
terance. This is no easy task ? CRs may take many
different forms (often highly elliptical), and can be
intended to be interpreted with many different read-
ings which query different aspects of the original ut-
terance. As a result, dialogue system design has tra-
ditionally attempted to avoid the necessity for CR
interpretation by making system utterances as clear
and precise as possible, and avoid having to generate
all but the most simple CRs by using robust shallow
methods of interpretation or by relying on highly
domain-dependent lexicons and grammars. How-
ever, as systems become more human-like, it seems
likely that we will have to cope with user CRs at
some stage; and the ability to generate system CRs
can be useful in order to repair misunderstanding,
disambiguate other utterances, and learn new words
? see (Knight, 1996; Dusan and Flanagan, 2002;
Purver, 2002).
The investigations presented here had two main
aims: to examine (a) how CRs are interpreted, and
(b) how they are responded to. The two are clearly
dependent ? the response must depend on the inter-
pretation ? but there are many other influencing fac-
tors such as CR form, context and level of ground-
ing. Answers to (a) should help us with the follow-
ing questions:
? What factors can help us disambiguate and cor-
rectly interpret user CRs?
? What factors should govern generation of sys-
tem CRs such that they are correctly interpreted
by the user?
Answers to (b) should help with the following re-
lated questions:
? How (and when) should we answer user CRs?
? How (and when) should we expect users to re-
spond to system CRs?
The paper is organised as follows. The next sec-
tion gives a brief overview of CRs in general and
some previous corpus work. Section 3 describes fur-
ther corpus work which gives some general results
concerning response type. Section 4 then describes
a text-based dialogue experiment examining the de-
tailed effects on interpretation and response of part-
of-speech (PoS) type and level of grounding for one
particular CR form, and section 5 then draws some
general conclusions.
2 Clarification Requests
Purver et al (2001; 2002) presented a taxonomy
of CR forms and readings derived from a corpus
study using the British National Corpus (BNC) ?
see (Burnard, 2000). This showed that some forms
showed a high correlation with certain readings, but
that some were highly ambiguous.
Purver et al (2002)?s taxonomy of CR forms is
given in table 1 and CR readings in table 21. Some
CRs (the non-reprise class) explicitly identify the
clarification required, e.g. ?What did you say?? or
?What do you mean??, and some forms (e.g. literal
reprises) appear to favour a particular reading almost
exclusively, but most are more ambiguous. Indeed,
they found that the two most common forms (the
conventional and reprise fragment form) could take
any reading.
Although this corpus study provided informa-
tion about the distribution of different CR forms
and readings, it did not provide any information
about the specific conditions which prompt partic-
ular readings and affect how the CR is answered.
In this paper we concentrate mostly on the reprise
fragment (RF) form, where only a single part of
the problem utterance, possibly a single word, is
reprised2 as in example (1). This form is not only
1They also give a correction reading, which we have ex-
cluded here: such CRs are almost exclusively self-corrections
and as such do not fit well with our discussion here. They are
also very rare compared with the other classes, making up only
about 2% of CRs.
2Such reprises need not be verbatim repeats: users may use
anaphoric terms or use a clearer expression in order to clarify
the fragment in question.
common (approximately 30% of CRs in the previ-
ous study) and can appear with many readings (al-
though biased towards a clausal reading ? 87% of
occurrences), but specifies the problematic element
that it clarifies quite precisely, and therefore should
give us scope for examining the effect of features of
that element.

Gary: Aye, but <pause> you
know <pause> like you
se- she mentioned one in
particular, like
Jake: What?
Gary: the word skeilth
Jake: Skeilth?
Lilias: Mm.
Gary: Aha.
Jake: Aye, yeah, yeah, take skeilth.
Intuitively, at least two such features would be
expected to affect the type of reading assigned to
a RF: PoS category and level of grounding.4 The
PoS category of the reprised word should influence
expectations about what is being clarified. For ex-
ample, reprise of a content word (e.g. noun or verb)
should be more likely to signal a constituent problem
than a reprise of a function word (e.g. preposition or
determiner). Dialogue participants would normally
assume that the meaning of function words is well
known in a particular linguistic community and that,
as a result, a reprise of a function word is more likely
to signal clausal or lexical problems. RF interpreta-
tion should also depend on whether a reprised frag-
ment is already considered to have been grounded
by the participants in a conversation. For example,
a reprise of a proper noun would be more likely to
be read as signalling a constituent problem if it oc-
curs on the first mention than on second mention.
All things being equal, the content of a constituent
is already considered to have been established by the
time a second mention occurs.
3 Corpus Investigation
Accordingly we have re-examined the corpus from
the above study in order to add information about

information in the BNC. In the future we hope to investigate
this using other corpora and experimental methods.

3.1 Method
The same corpus was re-marked for four attributes:
response type and CR-answer distance, and the PoS
and last mention of the original source element.
The markup scheme used for response type
evolved during the study and is shown in table 3:
it includes classification of apparently unanswered
CRs into those that may have been answered, but
the sentence possibly containing an answer was tran-
scribed in the BNC as <unclear>; those that ap-
pear to have remained unanswered because the CR
initiator continued their turn without pause; and
those that are not answered at all (or at least where
we have no indication of an answer ? eye contact,
head movement etc. are not recorded in the BNC but
could function as answers). In cases where the ini-
tial response was followed by further information,
both were recorded, but the results here are pre-
sented only for the initial response. Further work
later may take both into account, along the lines of
(Hockey et al, 1997) who showed this to be impor-
tant for questions in general.
CR-answer distance was marked in terms of the
sentence numbering scheme in the BNC ? in these
cases it corresponds very closely to distance in
speaker turns, although the correspondence is not
exact.
PoS category and time of last mention of the
source element were marked, but have not currently
been used due to lack of useful data (see below).
Reliability of the markup has not yet been exam-
ined. However, the method is close to that of (Purver
et al, 2002) (and the corpus is identical), where re-
liability was examined and found to be acceptable.
We then examined the correlation between CR type
and response type, between reading and response
type, and the spread of CR-answer distance.
3.2 Results
3.2.1 Response Type
Results for response type are shown in table 4 as
raw numbers, and also in table 5 as percentages for
each CR type, with the none, cont, uncl and qury
classes conflated as one ?unanswered? class, and
only the most common 4 CR forms shown.
The most striking result is perhaps the high over-
all number of CRs that do not receive an answer:
39% of all CRs do not appear to be answered overall,
although this reduces to 17% when taking account
of those marked uncl (possible answers transcribed
none No answer
cont CR initiator continues immediately
uncl Possible answer but transcribed as <unclear>
qury CR explicitly queried
frg Answered with parallel fragment
sent Answered with full sentence
yn Answered with polar particle
Table 3: CR response types
as <unclear>) and cont (the CR-raiser continues
without waiting). The most common forms (conven-
tional and RF) appear to be answered least ? around
45% go unanswered for both. The form which ap-
pears to be most likely to be answered overall is the
explicit non-conventional form.
Some forms appear to have high correlations
with particular response types. As might be ex-
pected, sluices (which are wh-questions) are gen-
erally answered with fragments, and never with a
polar yes/no answer. Yes/no answers also seem to
be unsuitable for the conventional CR form, which
is generally answered with a full sentence. RFs,
conversely, are not often answered with full sen-
tences, but can be responded to either by fragments
or yes/no answers.
Similarly, from tables 6 and 7 (again, percentages
given for each CR reading, with ?unanswered? re-
sponse types conflated and only the most common 3
readings shown) we can see that there is a correla-
tion between reading and response type, but that this
correlation is also not as simple as a direct reading-
answer correspondence. Clausal CRs are unlikely to
be answered with full sentences, but can get either
fragment or yes/no responses. Constituent CRs are
less likely to get yes/no responses but could get ei-
ther other type. Interestingly, constituent CRs seem
to be roughly twice as likely to get a response as
clausal or lexical CRs (even though there are fewer
examples of constituent CRs than the others, this
difference is statistically significant, with a ?2(1) test
showing <0.5% probability of independence).
3.2.2 Answer Distance
Results for CR-answer distance are shown in ta-
ble 8. It is clear that the vast majority (94%) of CRs
that are answered are answered in the immediately

equivalent figures for non-clarificational questions,
a study is in progress and initial indications are that
in general, answers are less immediate: only about
70% have distance 1, with some up to distance 6.5
We therefore expect that (a) answering user CRs
must be done immediately, and that any dialogue
management scheme must take this into account,
and (b) we should expect answers to any system
CRs to come immediately ? interpretation routines
(we are thinking especially of any ellipsis resolution
routines here) should not assume that later turns are

3.2.3 Further Details
While interesting, we would like to know more
detail than the general trends described above: in
particular we would like to know the effect of
the factors we have mentioned (word category and
grounding) for particular forms. As stated above,
we concentrate here on the reprise fragment form.
Examination of original CR source fragment PoS
category, in order to test the effect of the con-
tent/function distinction, showed that almost all RFs
were of content words or whole phrases: only 6 of
118 RFs were of function words, all of which were
determiners (mostly numbers). This is interesting in
itself: perhaps RFs are unlikely to be used to clarify
uses of e.g. prepositions. However, the effect may
be due to lack of data, and does not provide us with
any way of testing the distinction between clausal
and constituent reading that we expect.
Markup of last mention of the original source
fragment has also not given results in which we can
be confident. For RFs, we have seen that all con-
stituent readings occur on the first mention of the
fragment (as expected) ? but there are too few of
these examples to draw any firm conclusions. It is
also impossible to know whether first mention in the
transcription is really the first mention between the
participants: we do not know what happened before
the tape was turned on, what their shared history is,
or what is said during the frequent portions marked
as <unclear>.
So we need more information than our current
corpus can provide. In order to examine these ef-
fects properly we have therefore designed an exper-
imental technique to allow dialogues to be manipu-
lated directly, with reprises with the desired proper-
ties automatically introduced into the conversation.
The next section describes this technique and the ex-
periment performed.
4 Experimental Work
Empirical analyses of dialogue phenomena have
typically focused either on detailed descriptive anal-
yses of corpora of conversations (Schegloff, 1987)
or on the experimental manipulation of relatively
global parameters of interaction such as task type or
communicative modality (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs,
1986), (Garrod and Doherty, 1994). These stud-
ies have been used to to motivate a variety of pro-
posals about turn-level mechanisms and procedures
that sustain dialogue co-ordination. Further devel-
opment and testing of these proposals has, how-
ever, been limited by the indirect nature of the avail-
able evidence. Corpus studies provide, retrospec-
tive, correlational data which is susceptible to chal-
lenge and re-interpretation. Current psycholinguis-
tic techniques do not provide ways of integrating ex-
perimental manipulations into interactions in a man-
ner that is sensitive to the linguistic and conversa-
tional context. This section introduces a technique
for carrying out experiments in which text-based in-
teractions can be directly manipulated at the turn
level, and gives the results of an experiment which
uses this approach to investigate the effects of the
factors mentioned above on interpretation and re-
ponse to RFs. We also briefly discuss the range of
potential applications and some of the practical lim-
itations of the approach in the context of the experi-
mental results.
4.1 Manipulating ?Chat? Interactions
The experimental technique presented here draws on
two general developments. Firstly, the increasing
use of text-based forms of synchronous conversa-
tional interaction, for example: chat rooms (MUD?s,
MOO?s etc.), instant messaging, and some online
conferencing tools. Secondly, advances in natural
language processing technology which make some
forms of text processing and transformation fast
enough to be performed on a time scale consistent
with exchanges of turns in synchronous text chat.
The basic paradigm involves pairs of subjects,
seated in different rooms, communicating using a
synchronous text chat tool (see figure 1 for an ex-
ample). However, instead of passing each completed
turn directly to the appropriate chat clients, each turn
is routed via a server. Depending on the specific
goals of the experiment, the server can be used to
systematically modify turns in a variety of ways. For
example, some simple forms of mis-communication
can be introduced into an interaction by transform-
ing the order of characters in some of the input
words or by substituting words with plausible non-
words. Importantly, the server controls which mod-
ifications are broadcast to which participant. So, if
participant A types the word ?table? the sever can
echo back A: table to participant A and a trans-
formed version, say, ?blate? to participant B who
sees A: blate. The ability to set up controlled
asymmetries of this kind between the participants in
a interaction creates a powerful range of experimen-
tal possibilities. Here, we describe an application of
this technique to the investigation of reprise clarifi-
cation requests (CR?s).
A chat-tool experiment was designed to test the
following hypotheses:
1. RFs for function words will normally receive
clausal readings, whereas both clausal and con-
stituent readings will be available for content
words.
2. RFs for content words will receive more con-
stituent readings on first mention than on sec-
ond mention.
3. No difference is predicted for RFs for function
words on first vs. second mention.
4.2 Method
Two tasks were used to elicit dialogue, a balloon
debate and a story-telling task. In the balloon de-
bate subjects are presented with a fictional scenario
in which a balloon is losing altitude and about to
crash. The only way for any of three passengers to
survive is for one of them to jump to a certain death.
The three passengers are; Dr. Nick Riviera, a can-
cer scientist, Mrs. Susie Derkins, a pregnant primary
school teacher, and Mr. Tom Derkins, the balloon
pilot and Susie?s husband. Subjects are asked to de-
cide who should jump. The advantages of this task
are that it is effective at generating debates between
subjects and involves repeated references to particu-
lar individuals.
Following (Bavelas et al, 1992), the second di-
alogue task used was the story-telling task. In this
case subjects are asked to relate a ?near-miss? story
about some experience in which something bad al-
most happened but in the end everything was okay.
This was chosen because, unlike the balloon task,
the topic of the exchange is unrestricted, in effect
a random factor, and the interaction relates to real
events.
4.2.1 Subjects
Twenty-eight subjects were recruited, 20 male
and 8 female, average age 19 years, from computer
science and IT undergraduate students. They were
recruited in pairs to ensure that the members of a
pair were familiar with one another and only sub-
jects who had experience with some form of text
chat such as chat rooms, IRC, ICQ or other mes-
saging systems were used. Each subject was paid
at a rate of ?7.50 per hour for participating in the
experiment.
4.2.2 Materials
A custom experimental chat tool, written in Java
and Perl, was used for the experiment. The user in-
terface is similar to instant messaging applications:
a lower window is used to enter text, and the con-
versation is displayed in the main upper window as
it emerges (see figure 1). The chat clients were run
on two Fujitsu LCD tablet computers with text in-
put via standard external keyboards, with the server
running on a standard PC in a separate room.
User Interface The Chattool client user interface
is written in Java and is designed to be familiar
to subjects experienced with instant messaging/chat
applications. The application window is split into
two panes: a lower pane for text entry and an up-
per pane in which the conversation is displayed (see
figure 1). A status display between the two panes
shows whether the other participant is active (typ-
ing) at any time. This can be artificially controlled
during the generation of artificial turns to make it
appear as if they are generated by the other partici-
pant. The client also has the ability to display an er-
ror message and prevent text entry: this can be used
to delay one participant while the other is engaged
in an artificially-generated turn sequence.
Server Each turn is submitted to a server (also
written in Java) on a separate machine when a ?Send?
button or the ?Return? key is pressed. This server
passes the text to a NLP component for processing
and possible transformation, and then displays the
original version to the originator client, and the pro-
cessed (or artificially generated) version to the other
client. The server records all turns, together with
each key press from both clients, for later analysis.
This data is also used on the fly to control the speed
and capitalisation of artificially generated turns, to
be as realistic a simulation of the relevant subject as
possible.
NLP Component The NLP component consists
of a Perl text-processing module which commu-
nicates with various external NLP modules as re-
quired: PoS tagging can be performed using LT-
POS (Mikheev, 1997), word rarity/frequency tag-
ging using a custom tagger based on the BNC (Kil-
garriff, 1997), and synonym generation using Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998).
Experimental parameters are specified as a set of
rules which are applied to each word in turn. Pre-
conditions for the application of the rule can be spec-
ified in terms of PoS, word frequency and the word
itself, together with contextual factors such as the
time since the last artificial turn was generated, and
a probability threshold to prevent behaviour appear-
ing too regular. The effect of the rule can be to
transform the word in question (by substitution with
another word, a synonym or a randomly generated
non-word, or by letter order scrambling) or to trigger
an artificially generated turn sequence (currently a
reprise fragment, followed by an acknowledgement,
although other turn types are possible).
The current experimental setup consists of rules
which generate pairs of RFs and subsequent
acknowledgements6, for proper nouns, common
nouns, verbs, determiners and prepositions, with
probabilities determined during a pilot experiment
to give reasonable numbers of RFs per subject. No
use is made of word rarity or synonyms.
The turn sequences are carried out by (a) present-
ing the artificially-generated RF to the relevant client
only; (b) waiting for a response from that client, pre-
venting the other client from getting too far ahead
by locking the interface if necessary; (c) presenting
an acknowledgement to that response; and (d) pre-
senting any text typed by the other client during the
sequence.
4.2.3 Procedure
Prior to taking part subjects were informed that
the experimenters were carrying out a study of the
effects of a network-based chat tool on the way peo-
6Acknowledgements are randomly chosen amongst: ?ah?,
?oh?, ?oh ok?, ?right?, ?oh right?, ?uh huh?, ?i see?, ?sure?.
ple interact with one another. They were told that
their interaction would be logged, anonymously, and
kept for subsequent analysis. Subjects were advised
that they could also request the log to be deleted af-
ter completion of the interaction. They were not in-
formed of the artificial interventions until afterwards
(see below).
At the start of the experiment subjects were given
a brief demonstration of the operation of the chat
tool.
To prevent concurrent verbal or gestural interac-
tion subjects were seated in separate rooms. Each
pair performed both dialogue tasks and were given
written instructions in each case. The balloon task
was carried out once and the story-telling task twice;
one story for each participant. To control for or-
der effects the order of presentation of the two tasks
was counterbalanced across pairs. A 10-minute time
limit was imposed on both tasks. At the end of
the experiment subjects were fully debriefed and the
intervention using ?artificial? clarifications was ex-
plained to them.
This resulted in a within-subjects design with two
factors; category of reprise fragment and level of
grounding (first vs. second mention).
After the experiment, the logs were manually cor-
rected for the PoS category of the RF and for the
first/second mention clarification. PoS required cor-
rection as the tagger produced incorrect word cate-
gories in approximately 30% of cases. In some in-
stances this was due to typing errors or text-specific
conventions, such as ?k? for ?okay?, that were not
recognised. Detection and classification of proper
nouns was also sensitive to capitalisation. Subjects
were not consistent or conventional in their capitali-
sation of words and this caused some misclassifica-
tions. In addition a small proportion of erroneous
tags were found. Each system-generated CR was
checked and, where appropriate, corrected. Because
pairs completed both tasks together CRs classified
as ?first mentions? were checked to ensure that they
hadn?t already occured in a previous dialogue.
4.3 Results
The readings attributed to each RF were classified
in the same way as the original BNC-based cor-
pus, with the addition of one further category: non-
clarificational, referring to situations in which the
fragment is treated as something other than a CR
(this did not apply when building the original cor-
pus, as only utterances treated as CRs were con-
sidered). In the experimental results, gap, lexical
and non-clarificational readings were low frequency
events (4, 1 and 8 instances respectively) and no in-
stances of correction readings were noted. These fig-
ures are comparable with (Purver et al, 2002)?s ob-
servations for the BNC. For statistical analysis these
three categories of reading were grouped together as
?Other?.
Across the corpus as a whole a total of 215
system-generated RFs were produced. In 50% of
cases the system-generated clarification received no
response from the target participant. This may be
due in part to the medium: unlike verbal exchanges,
participants in text-chat can produce their turns si-
multaneously. This can result in turns getting out
of sequence since users may still be responding to a
prior turn when a new turn arrives. Users must then
trade off the cost of undoing their turn in progress
to respond to the new one, against going ahead any-
way and responding to the new turn later if it seems
necessary. Thus in some cases we observed that the
response to a clarification was displaced to the end
of the turn in progress or to a subsequent turn. How-
ever, comparison with the BNC results from sec-
tion 3 above show similar figures: only 56% of the
frg class received a clear answer. Although the
true figure will be higher (of the 56%, 5% may have
been answered, but the next turn was transcribed as
<unclear>, and we cannot know in how many
cases the reprise may have been answered using
non-verbal signals), it seems likely that a significant
proportion may simply be ignored.

Table 9: Frequency of Reading Types By RF Cate-
gory and Mention
The distribution of reading types according to
word category was tested firstly by comparing the
frequency of Clausal, Constituent, and Other read-
ings for content words and function words. This
proved to be reliably different (?2(2) = 35.3, p =
0.00).7 As table 9 shows, RFs of Function words
were almost exclusively interpreted as Other, i.e. ei-
ther Gap, Lexical or Non-clarificational. By contrast
Content word reprises were interpreted as Clausal
CRs 53% of the time, as Constituent CRs 29% of
the time and as Other 18% of the time.
Content word and Function word clarifications
were also compared for the the frequency with
which they received a response. This showed no
reliable difference (?2(1) = 1.95, p = 0.16) indicat-
ing that although the pattern of interpretation for
Content and Function reprises is different they are
equally likely to receive some kind of response.
The influence of grounding on reading type was
assessed firstly by comparing the relative frequency
of Constituent, Clausal and Other readings on first
and second mention. This was reliably different
(?2(2) = 6.28, p = 0.04) indicating that level of
grounding affects the reading assigned. A focussed
comparison of Constituent and Clausal readings on
first and second mention shows no reliable differ-
ence (?2(1) = 0.0, p = 0.92). Together these findings
indicate that, across all word categories, Constituent
and Clausal readings are more likely for RF?s of a
first mention than a second mention and, conversely,
Other readings are less likely for RF?s to a first men-
tion than a second mention.
The effect of grounding on the relative frequency
with which a clarification received a response was
also tested. This indicated a strong effect of mention
(?2(1) = 12.01, p = 0.00); 58% of reprise clarifications
of first mentions recieved a response whereas only
33% of second mention clarifications did.
4.4 Discussion
The experimental results support two basic conclu-
sions. Firstly, people?s interpretation of the type of
CR a reprise fragment is intended to make is influ-
enced both by the category of the reprise fragment
and its level of grounding. Secondly, reprise frag-
ment CRs to first mentions are much more likely to
be responded to than reprise fragment CRs for sec-

ond mentions.
Text-based and verbal interaction have different
properties as communicative media. Amongst other
things, in text-chat turns take longer to produce,
are normally produced in overlap, and they persist
for longer. However, even given these differences,
the general pattern of clarifications observed in the
experimental task is similar to that noted in ver-
bal dialogue. In particular, Lexical, Gap and Non-
clarificational readings are infrequent and reprise
fragment clarifications are ignored with surprising
frequency. In the present data, the clearest contrast
between text-based and verbal interaction is in the
relative frequency of Constituent and Clausal read-
ings. In the BNC reprise fragments receive Clausal
readings in 87% of cases, and constituent readings in
6% of cases. In the experimental corpus they receive
Clausal readings in 48% of cases and Constituent
readings in 34% of cases.
These findings demonstrate the viability, and
some limitations, of investigating dialogue co-
ordination through the manipulation of chat-tool
based interactions. The chat tool was successful
in producing plausible clarification sequences. Al-
though in some cases participants had difficulty
making sense of the artificial clarifications this did
not make them distinguishable from other, real, but
equally problematic turns from other participants.
The clarifications were mostly successful in creat-
ing realistic exchanges such as those illustrated in
figures 2 and 3. When questioned during debriefing,
no participants reported any suspicions about the ex-
perimental manipulation.
The main practical difficulty encountered in the
present study related to text-chat conventions such
as novel spellings, abbreviations, and use of ?smi-
leys?. This created specific problems for the PoS
tagger which assumes a more standard form of En-
glish. These problems were also compounded by the
noise introduced by typing errors and inconsistency
in spelling and capitalisation.
The experiment presented here exploits only one
possibility for the use of this technique. Other
prossible manipulations include; manipulation of
distance, in turns or time, between target and probe,
substitution of synonyms, hyponyms and hyper-
nyms, introduction of artifical turns, blocking of
certain forms of response. The important potential
it carries, particularly in comparison with corpus-
based techniques, is in the investigation of dialogue
phenomena which for various reasons are infrequent
in existing corpora.
5 Conclusions
The main conclusions we draw from the results pre-
sented here are as follows:
? Reprise CRs appear to go without response far
more often than might be expected, both in the
BNC and in our experimental corpus. Both
may be effects of the media (transcription in
one case, turn sequencing overlap in the other),
but the figures are large enough and similar
enough to warrant further investigation.
? Corpus investigation shows some strong corre-
lations between CR form and expected answer
type. It also shows that responses to CRs, when
they come, come immediately.
? Both word PoS category and first/second men-
tion appear to be reliable indicators of RF read-
ing. This can help us in disambiguating user
CRs, and in choosing forms when generating
system CRs.
? RFs generated on the first mention of a word
have a higher likelihood of receiving a response
than on second mention.
? We have presented a new experimental tech-
nique for manipulating dialogue, which we be-
lieve has many potential uses in dialogue re-
search.
