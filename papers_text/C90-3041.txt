Semantic Features proposed 
regulate co-occurence of verbs 
with their non-obli?atory 
dependents - such as Modifiers 
of place or time; Instrumental 
and Benefactive objects and the 
l i ke .  
( concern i n~ both i nd i v i dual 
words and semantic  c lasses  of  
words) and with concordances 
made on the bas i s of a 
suffi c i ent ly re presentat i ve 
corpus of  Russian texts .  
One of the bas ic  components of 
the system is its lexicon; the 
lexicon contains information not 
only about ind iv idua l  lexer~s,  
but a l so  about sen~nt ic  and 
syntact i c  c lasses  of  lexemes. 
Thus, fo r  nominal lexe~es such 
features are ~iven as: "NATURAL 
CLASS", "ARTEFACT", "MASS TERM", 
"SET", "BODY PART" and the l ike.  
For predicates the lexicon 
i yes the values of such

features as Vendlerian classes 
(STATE, ACT IV ITY, 
ACCOMPL I SHMENT, ACH I EVEIvENT), 
of. \ [ I \ ] ;  
NONCONTROLLED 
poss ib i l i ty  
subordinate 
\ [g \ ] ,  etc. 
I t  is argued that 
cases combinab i l i ty  of  
CONTROLLED vs. 
action \[2, p. 32\]; 
off having a 
i nd i rec t  question 
in many 
a. word 
can be predicted on the basis off 
the semantic class(es) it 
belongs to. Thus, semar~tic 
classifications will be the main 
topic off our expos i t ion .  
It turned out that altogether 
different approaches ar'e 
requ i red  for semant ic  
c lass i f i ca t ions  off p red icates  
and For lexemes with non 
predicative neaning. In this 
paper we give central attention 
to the predicative zone off the 
lexicon. 
Semantics of verbs has been 
studied intensely in recent 
year's, of. works by Ch. Fillmore 
\[3\], Z. Vendler \[i\], L. Karttunen 
\[3\]. it was a long tradition for 
linguists to lay the strongest 
emphasis on the 
se,emtic properties 
verbs. Our ~oal 
will be to attract 
individual 
off separate 
in this paper 
attention to 
those semant ic  properties of 
verbs that affect their 
combinab i l i ty  and s t i l l  are 
common to more or less numerous 
verb classes. 
Thus, combinability of verbs 
with subordinated noun phrases 
or adverbials designating place, 
time~ re&~on~ purpose~ 
Instrun~nt and other parameters 
of the situation denoted by a 
predicate (taken together with 
its arguments) was usually. 
assumed to be non-restricted. 
This is definitely not the case, 
and the problem deserves special 
attention. There are some well 
known important observations 
made in this area. Thus, as is 
known, one of the Vendlerian 
classes - accomplishment verbs - 
is  singled out by the fact that 
some verbs combine with a 
special kind of time adverbials, 
such as  in  two hours ;  these 
adverbials designate a per iod of 
ti~re dur'in~ which 
went on and f ina l ly  
inFerent  l im i t .  
In what follows 
the process 
reached its 
we shall 
demonstrate severa l  sen~nt ic 
cl&sses of Russian verbs with 
the correspond i ng rules of 
sen~nt i c co- ocourence 
restraints. We ar,~ue that the 
restr.ai nts d i soussed are 
semantic in the i r  nature; thus, 
it is natural to suppose, that 
some analogous or. co~nate 
r-estrai nts would hold For 
corresponding sel~ntic classes 
of verbs in other" languages. CF. 
the look by A. Wierzhbioka \[8\] 
where the author strives for 
selm%ntic explar,ations in ~r,a~zr 
in a broad sense of the word, 
namely, tries to find semantic 
mot i vat i on for every 
co-occurrence restriction in the 
cho ice of morphemes or 
grammat i cal construct ions.

I ndeed,  fo r  a s i tuat ion  
descr ibed  by a verb  de;waTb ? to  
run  ? or, peaaTz~ ? to  cut"  (both  o f  
them concrete) it is always 
possible to say, for every fixed 
~on~nt, what the subject 
involved in the situation is 
doing at this moment. On the 
other hand, there are verbs that 
p~esent the situation in such a 
way that they emphasize the 
final result of the action 
described while the rrea~s used 
in  o rder  to  ach ieve  th i s  resu l t  
remain in  the shadow; and t t~ is

ca l l  such  verbs  r~-~rete .  
Thus, OTOMOTMTb means  " to  
reven~e onese l f  for" an ev i l  
committed eaz ' l i e r "  ; but the 
means used in order to attain 
this goal are irrelevant. As a 
consequence, no concrete phases 
can be discerned in the action 
denoted by this verb: the verb 
OTO~CT~Crb does not express "an 
unfolding a~t ion", even when 
used in the Imperfective. The 
same is true for the verb ncnop- 
T~ " to  spo i l " ,  wh ich  i s  a l so  
non-concrete: ~c no pTzT~ means 
"to deprive of the possibility 
of normal functioning'; but the

fu l f i l l ed  i s  i r re levant  fo r  the  
meart in~ of the wor'd~ so it+ has  
no phases, it does not denote a 
developin\[ process. 
Non-concrete verbs very often 
are aspectual ly defective; 
namely, they either have no 
Imperfective or, bein~ used in 
the Imperfect ive, they lack 
Progressive meaning. Thus, amon~ 
the verbs that, accordin~ to Ju. 
Apresjan \[7\] belong to the class 
of the so-called momentary verbs 
(ach ievements  in  Vend ler '  s 
terminology) and thus lack a

the verb ~wi~cTbca, denotin\[ an

It is a well-known fan~t that 
verbs denotin~ non-controlled
