Abstract 
In this paper, we present a new word alignment 
combination approach on language pairs where 
one language has no explicit word boundaries. 
Instead of combining word alignments of dif-
ferent models (Xiang et al, 2010), we try to 
combine word alignments over multiple mono-
lingually motivated word segmentation. Our 
approach is based on link confidence score de-
fined over multiple segmentations, thus the 
combined alignment is more robust to inappro-
priate word segmentation. Our combination al-
gorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to 
implement. In the Chinese-English experiment, 
our approach effectively improved word align-
ment quality as well as translation performance 
on all segmentations simultaneously, which 
showed that word alignment can benefit from 
complementary knowledge due to the diversity 
of multiple and monolingually motivated seg-
mentations. 
1 Introduction 
Word segmentation is the first step prior to word 
alignment for building statistical machine transla-
tions (SMT) on language pairs without explicit 
word boundaries such as Chinese-English.  Many 
works have focused on the improvement of word 
alignment models. (Brown et al, 1993; Haghighi et 
al., 2009; Liu et al, 2010). Most of the word 
alignment models take single word segmentation 
as input. However, for languages such as Chinese, 
it is necessary to segment sentences into appropri-
ate words for word alignment. 
A large amount of works have stressed the im-
pact of word segmentation on word alignment. Xu 
et al (2004), Ma et al (2007), Chang et al (2008), 
and Chung et al (2009) try to learn word segmen-
tation from bilingually motivated point of view; 
they use an initial alignment to learn word segmen-
tation appropriate for SMT. However, their per-
formance is limited by the quality of the initial 
alignments, and the processes are time-consuming. 
Some other methods try to combine multiple word 
segmentation at SMT decoding step (Xu et al, 
2005; Dyer et al, 2008; Zhang et al, 2008; Dyer et 
al., 2009; Xiao et al, 2010). Different segmenta-
tions are yet independently used for word align-
ment. 
Instead of time-consuming segmentation optimi-
zation based on alignment or postponing segmenta-
tion combination late till SMT decoding phase, we 
try to combine word alignments over multiple 
monolingually motivated word segmentation on 
Chinese-English pair, in order to improve word 
alignment quality and translation performance for 
all segmentations. We introduce a tabular structure 
called word segmentation network (WSN for short) 
to encode multiple segmentations of a Chinese sen-
tence, and define skeleton links (SL for short) be-
tween spans of WSN and words of English 
sentence. The confidence score of a SL is defined 
over multiple segmentations. Our combination al-
gorithm picks up potential SLs based on their con-
fidence scores similar to Xiang et al (2010), and 
then projects each selected SL to link in all seg-
mentation respectively. Our algorithm is simple, 
efficient, easy to implement, and can effectively 
improve word alignment quality on all segmenta-
tions simultaneously, and alignment errors caused 
1
by inappropriate segmentations from single seg-
menter can be substantially reduced. 
Two questions will be answered in the paper: 1) 
how to define the link confidence over multiple 
segmentations in combination algorithm? 2) Ac-
cording to Xiang et al (2010), the success of their 
word alignment combination of different models 
lies in the complementary information that the 
candidate alignments contain. In our work, are 
multiple monolingually motivated segmentations 
complementary enough to improve the alignments? 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: 
WSN will be introduced in section 2. Combination 
algorithm will be presented in section 3. Experi-
ments of word alignment and SMT will be reported 
in section 4. 
2  Word Segmentation Network 
We propose a new structure called word segmenta-
tion network (WSN) to encode multiple segmenta-
tions. Due to space limitation, all definitions are 
presented by illustration of a running example of a 
sentence pair: 
 
???? (xia-yu-lu-hua)  
Road is slippery when raining 
 
We first introduce skeleton segmentation. Given 
two segmentation S1 and S2 in Table 1, the word 
boundaries of their skeleton segmentation is the 
union of word boundaries (marked by ?/?) in S1 
and S2. 
 
 Segmentation 
S1 ? / ? / ?? 
S2 ?? / ? / ? 
skeleton ? / ? / ? / ? 
 
Table 1: The skeleton segmentation of two seg-
mentations S1 and S2. 
 
The WSN of S1 and S2 is shown in Table 2.  As 
is depicted, line 1 and 2 represent words in S1 and 
S2 respectively, line 3 represents skeleton words. 
Each column, or span, comprises a skeleton word 
and words of S1 and S2 with the skeleton word as 
their morphemes at that position. The number of 
columns of a WSN is equal to the number of skele-
ton words. It should be noted that there may be 
words covering two or more spans, such as ???? 
in S1, because the word ???? in S1 is split into 
two words ??? and ??? in S2.  
S1 ? 1 ? 2 ?? 3 
S2 ?? 1 ? 2 ? 3 
skeleton ? 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 
 
Table 2:  The WSN of Table 1. Subscripts 
indicate indexes of words. 
 
The skeleton word can be projected onto words 
in the same span in S1 and S2. For clarity, words in 
each segmentation are indexed (1-based), for ex-
ample, ???? in S1 is indexed by 3. We use a pro-
jection function       to denote the index of the 
word onto which the j-th skeleton word is project-
ed in the k-th segmentation, for example,       
  and        . 
In the next, we define the links between spans of 
the WSN and English words as skeleton links (SL), 
the subset of all SLs comprise the skeleton align-
ment (SA). Figure 1 shows an SA of the example. 
 
Figure 1: An example alignment between WSN in 
Table 2 and English sentence ?Road is slippery 
when raining?. (a) skeleton link; (b) skeleton 
alignment. 
 
Each span of the WSN comprises words from 
different segmentations (Figure 1a), which indi-
cates that the confidence score of a SL can be de-
fined over words in the same span. By projection 
function, a SL can be projected onto the link for 
each segmentation. Therefore, the problem of 
combining word alignment over different segmen-
tations can be transformed into the problem of se-
lecting SLs for SA first, and then project the 
selected SLs onto links for each segmentation re-
spectively.

of the Chinese WSN and its parallel English sen-
tence. Suppose     is the SL between the j-th span 
   and i-th English word   ,    
   is the link between 
the j-th Chinese word   
  in    and   . Inspired by 
Huang (2009), we define the confidence score of 
each SL as follows 
 (   |   )  ?             
           (1) 
 
where          
       is the confidence score of the 
link        
 , defined as 
 (       
 |   )
 ?    (       
 |   )              
       
(2) 
where c-to-e link posterior probability is defined as 
    (       
 |   )  
            
  
?               
   
    
  
 (3) 
and I is the length of  . E-to-c link posterior prob-
ability     (       
 |   )  can be defined similarly,  
Our alignment combination algorithm is as fol-
lows.  
1. Build WSN for Chinese sentence. 
2. Compute the confidence score for each SL 
based on Eq. (1). A SL     gets a vote from    
if        
  appears in             . Denote 
the set of all SLs getting at least one vote by 
  . 
3. All SLs in    are sorted in descending order 
and evaluated sequentially. A SL     is includ-
ed if its confidence score is higher than a tuna-
ble threshold  , and one of the following is 
true1: 
? Neither    nor    is aligned so far; 
?    is not aligned and its left or right neigh-
boring word is aligned to    so far; 
?    is not aligned and its left or right 
neighboring word is aligned to    so far. 
4. Repeat 3 until no more SLs can be included. 
All included SLs comprise   . 
5. Map SLs in    on each    to get k new align-
ments   
  respectively, i.e.   
          
      
   2         . For each  , we sort all 
                                                          
1 SLs getting   votes are forced to be included without further 
examination. 
2 Two or more SLs in    may be projected onto one links in 
  
 , in this case, we keep only one in   
 . 
links in   
  in ascending order and evaluated 
them sequentially  Compare   
  and   , A link 
    
  is removed from   
  if it is not appeared in 
  , and one of the following is true: 
? both   
 and    are aligned in   
 ; 
? There is a word which is neither left nor 
right neighboring word of    but aligned 
to   
  in   
 ; 
? There is a word which is neither left nor 
right neighboring word of   
  but aligned 
to    in   
 . 
The heuristic in step 3 is similar to Xiang et al 
(2010), which avoids adding error-prone links. We 
apply the similar heuristic again in step 5 in each 
  
            to delete error-prone links. The 
weights in Eq. (1) and   can be tuned in a hand-
aligned dataset to maximize word alignment F-
score on any   
  with hill climbing algorithm. 
Probabilities in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) can be estimat-
ed using GIZA. 
4 Experiment 
4.1   Data 
Our training set contains about 190K Chinese-
English sentence pairs from LDC2003E14 corpus. 
The NIST?06 test set is used as our development 
set and the NIST?08 test set is used as our test set. 
The Chinese portions of all the data are prepro-
cessed by three monolingually motived segmenters 
respectively. These segmenters differ in either 
training method or specification, including 
ICTCLAS (I)3, Stanford segmenters with CTB (C) 
and PKU (P) specifications4 respectively. We used 
a phrase-based MT system similar to (Koehn et al, 
2003), and generated two baseline alignments us-
ing GIZA++ enhanced by gdf heuristics (Koehn et 
al., 2003) and a linear discriminative word align-
ment model (DIWA) (Liu et al, 2010) on training 
set with the three segmentations respectively. A 5-
gram language model trained from the Xinhua por-
tion of Gigaword corpus was used.  The decoding 
weights were optimized with Minimum Error Rate 
Training (MERT) (Och, 2003). We used the hand-
aligned set of 491 sentence pairs in Haghighi et al 
(2009), the first 250 sentence pairs were used to 
tune the weights in Eq. (1), and the other 241 were

used to measure the word alignment quality. Note 
that we adapted the Chinese portion of this hand-
aligned set to segmentation C. 
4.2 Improvement of Word Alignment 
We first evaluate our combination approach on the 
hand-aligned set (on segmentation C). Table 3 
shows the precision, recall and F-score of baseline 
alignments and combined alignments. 
As shown in Table 3, the combination align-
ments outperformed the baselines (setting C) in all 
settings in both GIZA and DIWA. We notice that 
the higher F-score is mainly due to the higher pre-
cision in GIZA but higher recall in DIWA. In 
GIZA, the result of C+I and C+P achieve 8.4% and 
9.5% higher F-score respectively, and both of them 
outperformed C+P+I, we speculate it is because 
GIZA favors recall rather than DIWA, i.e. GIZA 
may contain more bad links than DIWA, which 
would lead to more unstable F-score if more 
alignments produced by GIZA are combined, just 
as the poor precision (69.68%) indicated. However, 
DIWA favors precision than recall (this observa-
tion is consistent with Liu et al (2010)), which 
may explain that the more diversified segmenta-
tions lead to better results in DIWA.

Figure 2 gives baseline alignments and com-
bined alignments on two sentence pairs in the 
training data. As can be seen, alignment errors 
caused by inappropriate segmentations by single 
segmenter were substantially reduced.  For exam-
ple, in the second example, the word ??????
?? hksar? appears in segmentation I of the Chi-
nese sentence, which benefits the generation of the 
three correct links connecting for words ??
?? ,????, ????? respectively in the com-
bined alignment. 
4.3   Improvement in MT performance 
We then evaluate our combination approach on the 
SMT training data on all segmentations. For effi-
ciency, we just used the first 50k sentence pairs of 
the aligned training corpus with the three segmen-
tations to build three SMT systems respectively. 
Table 4 shows the BLEU scores of baselines and 
combined alignment (C+P+I, and then projected 
onto C, P, I respectively). Our approach achieves 
improvement over baseline alignments on all seg-
mentations consistently, without using any lattice 
decoding techniques as Dyer et al (2009).  The 
gain of translation performance purely comes from 
improvements of word alignment on all segmenta-
tions by our proposed word alignment combination.

5 Conclusion 
We evaluated our word alignment combination 
over three monolingually motivated segmentations 
on Chinese-English pair. We showed that the com-
bined alignment significantly outperforms the 
baseline alignment with both higher F-score and 
higher BLEU score on all segmentations. Our work 
also proved the effectiveness of link confidence 
score in combining different word alignment mod-
els (Xiang et al, 2010), and extend it to combine 
word alignments over different segmentations. 
Xu et al (2005) and Dyer et al (2009) combine 
different segmentations for SMT. They aim to 
achieve better translation but not higher alignment 
quality of all segmentations. They combine multi-
ple segmentations at SMT decoding step, while we 
combine segmentation alternatives at word align-
ment step. We believe that we can further improve 
the performance by combining these two kinds of 
works. We also believe that combining word 
alignments over both monolingually motivated and 
bilingually motivated segmentations (Ma et al, 
2009) can achieve higher performance. 
In the future, we will investigate combining 
word alignments on language pairs where both 
languages have no explicit word boundaries such 
as Chinese-Japanese.
