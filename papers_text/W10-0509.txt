1 Introduction
Recent years have shown a large increase in the
usage of content creation platforms?blogs, com-
munity QA sites, forums, etc.?aimed at the gen-
eral public.User generated data contains emotional,
opinionated, sentimental, and personal posts. This
characteristic makes it an interesting data source
for exploring new types of linguistic analysis, as is
demonstrated by research on, e.g., sentiment analy-
sis [4], opinion retrieval [3], and mood detection [1].
We introduce the task of experience mining. Here,
the goal is to gain insights into criteria that people
formulate to judge or rate a product or its usage.
These criteria can be formulated as the expectations
that people have of the product in advance (i.e., the
reasons to buy), but can also be expressed as reports
of experiences while using the product and compar-
isons with other products. We focus on the latter:
reports of experiences with products. In this paper,
we define the task, describe guidelines for manual
annotation and analyze linguistic features that can
be used in an automatic experience mining system.
2 Motivation
Our main use-case is user-centered design for prod-
uct development. User-centered design [2] is an in-
novation paradigm where users of a product are in-
volved in each step of the research and development
process. The first stage of the product design process
is to identify unmet needs and demands of users for
a specific product or a class of products. Forums,
?This research was supported by project STE-09-12 within
the STEVIN programme funded by the Dutch and Flemish gov-
ernments, and by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific
Research (NWO) under projects 640.001.501, 640.002.501,
612.066.512, 612.061.814, 612.061.815, 640.004.802.
review sites, and mailing lists are platforms where
people share experiences about a subject they care
about. Although statements found in such platforms
may not always be representative for the general user
group, they can accelerate user-centered design.
Another use-case comes from online communi-
ties themselves. Users of online forums are often in-
terested in other people?s experiences with concrete
products and/or solutions for specific problems. To
quote one such user: [t]he polls are the only in-
formation we have, though, except for individual
[users] giving their own evaluations. With the vol-
ume of online data increasing rapidly, users need im-
proved access to previously reported experiences.
3 Experience mining
Experiences are particular instances of personally
encountering or undergoing something. We want
to identify experiences about a specific target prod-
uct, that are personal, involve an activity related to
the target and, moreover, are accompanied by judge-
ments or evaluative statements. Experience mining
is related to sentiment analysis and opinion retrieval,
in that it involves identifying attitudes; the key dif-
ference is, however, that we are looking for attitudes
towards specific experiences with products, not atti-
tudes towards the products themselves.
4 An explorative study
To assess the feasibility of automatic experience
mining, we carried out an explorative study: we
asked human assessors to find experiences in ac-
tual forum data and then examined linguistic fea-
tures likely to be useful for identifying experiences
automatically.

Table 1: Comparison of surface text features for posts
with and without experience; p(?) denotes probability.
We acquired data by crawling two forums on
shaving,1 with 111,268 posts written by 2,880 users.
Manual assessments Two assessors (both authors
of this paper) were asked to search for posts on five
specific target products using a standard keyword
search, and label each result post as:
? reporting no experience, or
? reporting an off-target experience, or
? reporting an on-target experience.
Moreover, posts should be marked as reporting an
experience only if (i) the author explicitly reports
his or someone else?s (a concrete person?s) use of
a product; and (ii) the author makes some conclu-
sions/judgements about the experience.
In total, 203 posts were labeled by the two asses-
sors, with 101 posts marked as reporting an experi-
ence by at least one assessor (71% of those an on-
target experience). The inter-annotator agreement
was 0.84, with Cohen?s ? = 0.71. If we merge
on- and off-target experience labels, the agreement
is 0.88, with ? = 0.76. The high level of agreement
demonstrates the validity of the task definition.
Features for experience mining We considered a
number of linguistic features and compared posts re-
porting experience (on- or off-target) to the posts

with no experience. Table 1 lists the features and
the comparison results. Remarkably, the subjectiv-
ity score is lower for experience posts: this indicates
that our task is indeed different from sentiment re-
trieval. Experience posts are on average twice as
long as non-experience posts and contain more sen-
tences with pronoun I. They also contain more con-
tent (non-modal) verbs, especially past tense verbs.
Table 2 presents a more detailed analysis of the verb
use. Experience posts appear to contain more verbs
referring to concrete actions rather than to attitude
and perception. It is still to be seen, though, whether
this informal observation can be quantified using re-
sources such as standard semantic verb classification
(state, process, action), WordNet verb hierarchy or
FrameNet semantic frames.
5 Conclusions
We introduced the novel task of experience min-
ing. Users of products share their experiences, and
mining these could help define requirements for
next-generation products. We developed annotation
guidelines for labeling experiences, and used them
to annotate data from online forums. An initial ex-
ploration revealed multiple features that might prove
useful for automatic labeling via classification.
