Some ~roblems of Word-Formation ~'ithin the Framework of 
a Generative Grammar 
Szab6 Zolt&n 
Word-formation has not yet received due attention in 
~enerat ive  grammars, p robab ly  becal~se i t  i s  an in ter im 
problem between that  of  the more-or - less  c lear ly  es tab l i -  
shed ~orpho-phonological possibi l i t ies and the problem of 
the lexicon, which h~s not yet been worked out (re~ardin~ 
wor@formation see the product ive  a t tempts  o f  Chomsky, 7,o 
Worth, ~,otsch, Vo lo tska ia ,  Zimmer). 
~;y intention is to examine word-formation from a 6e- 
nerative approach, i.e. to trace the possibi l it ies of ~e- 
neratia c derivatives.l shall base my attempLs on e~amples 
drawn from word-form~tion in liuncarian , a lanouaoe excep- 
tionally rich ia for,n~tive devices. 
I. Une first step is the separation of ~rars,~atical and 
lex ico l%ica l  derivatives.\['his is necessary in order to 
show wnafi belonbs to the lexicon and wJ.at does not.To ma - 
ke this de\]i~,itation we can use a relatively simple brans i 
fomrration: derivation ( D ) ~  syntactic construction 
(SC).ilere the meanirl 6 of the stem ($tM) and of the suf- 
fix (Su~) is carried by dif'ferent elements of the sen- 
tactic construction, e. G . STY': predicate, word qualif ied
