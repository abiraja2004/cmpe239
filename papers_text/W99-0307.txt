Abstract 
We discuss a tagging schema nd a tagging tool for 
labeling the rhetorical structure of texts. We also 
propose a statistical method for measuring agree- 
ment of hierarchical structure annotations and we 
discuss its strengths and weaknesses. The statis- 
tical measure we use suggests that annotators can 
achieve good levels of agreement on the task of 
determining the high-level, rhetorical structure of 
texts. Our empirical experiments also suggest that 
building discourse parsers that incrementally de- 
rive correct rhetorical structures of unrestricted texts 
without applying any form of backtracking is unfea- 
sible. 
1 Introduction 
Empirical studies of discourse structure have pri- 
marily focused on identifying discourse segment 
boundaries and their linguistic correlates. Very 
little attention has been paid so far to the high- 
level, rhetorical relations that hold between dis- 
course segments. In some cases, the role of these 
relations was considered to fall outside the scope of 
a study (Flammia and Zue, 1995); in other cases, 
judgements were made with respect o a taxon- 
omy of very few intention-based relations (usually 
dominance and satisfaction-precedence) (Grosz and 
Hirschberg, 1992; Nakatani et al, 1995; Hirschberg 
and Litman, 1987; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; 
Carletta et al, 1997). And in the only case in which 
a rich taxonomy of 29 relations was used (Moser 
and Moore, 1997), the corpus was small and spe- 
cific to a very restricted genre: written interactions 
between a student and tutor on the subject of fault 
location and repair in electronic ircuitry. 
In spite of many influential proposals in the lin- 
guistic of discourse structures and relations (Ballard 
et al, 1971; Grimes, 1975; Halliday and Hasan, 
1976; Martin, 1992; Mann and Thompson, 1988; 
Sanders et al, 1992; Sanders et al, 1993; Asher, 
1993; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Knott, 1995; 
Hovy and Maier, 1993), a number of empirical 
questions remain to be answered. 
? Can human judges construct rich discourse 
structures in a manner that ensures inter-judge 
agreement that is statistically significant? 
? How can one measure the agreement? 
#" How should judges (and programs) construct 
the discourse structure of texts; should they 
follow a top-down, bottom-up, or an incremen- 
tal procedure? 
? How does the genre of a text influence the de- 
gree to which judges achieve agreement on the 
task of rhetorical tagging? 
In this paper, we describe an experiment designed 
to answer these questions. 
2 The exper iment 
2.1 Tools 
We used as starting point O'Donnell's discourse an- 
notation tool (1997), which we improved signifi- 
cantly. The original tool constrains human judges to 
construct rhetorical structures in a bottom-up fash- 
ion: as a first step, judges determine the elementary 
discourse units (edu) of a text; subsequently, they 
recursively assemble the units into discourse trees, 
in a bottom-up fashion. As texts get larger, the an- 
notation process becomes impractical. 
We modified O'Donnell's tool in order to enable 
annotators to construct discourse structures in an in- 
cremental fashion as well. At any time t during the 
annotation process, annotators have access to two 
panels (see figure 1 for an example): 
? The upper panel displays in the style of Mann 
and Thompson (1988) the discourse structure 
built up to time t. The discourse structure is

Figure 1: A snapshot of our annotation tool 
a tree whose leaves correspond to edus and 
whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous 
text spans. Each internal node is characterized 
by a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that 
holds between two non-overlapping text spans 
called NUCLEUS and SATELLITE. (There are 
a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, 
such as the LIST relation that holds between 
units 4 and 5 and the CONTRAST relation that 
holds between spans \[6,7\] and \[8,9\] in figure 1, 
are multinuclear.) The distinction between u- 
clei and satellites comes from the empirical 
observation that the nucleus expresses what is 
more essential to the writer's purpose/intention 
than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a 
rhetorical relation is comprehensible indepen- 
dent of the satellite, but not vice versa. Some 
edus may contain parenthetical units, i.e., em- 
bedded units whose deletion does not affect he 
understanding ofthe edu to which they belong. 
For example, the unit shown in italics in (1) is 
parenthetic. 
This book, which 1 have received (1) 
from John, is the best book that I 
have read in a while. 
? The lower panel displays the text read by 
the annotator up to time t and only the first 
sentence that immediately follows the labeled 
edus. 
Annotators can create elementary and parenthetical 
units by clicking on their boundaries; immediately 
49 
add a newly created unit to a partial discourse struc- 
ture using operations specific to tree-adjoining and 
bottom-up arsers; postpone the construction of a 
partial discourse structure until the understanding 
of the text enables them to do so; take discourse 
structures apart and re-connect them; change rela- 
tion names and nuclearity assignments; undo any 
number of steps; etc. In other words, annotators 
have complete control over the discourse construc- 
tion strategy that hey employ. 
All actions taken by annotators are automatically 
logged. 
2.2 Annotation protocol 
One of us initially prepared a manual that contained 
instructions pertaining to the functionality of the 
tool, definitions of edus and rhetorical relations, and 
a protocol that was supposed to be followed during 
the annotation process (Marcu, 1998). 
Edus were defined functionally as clauses or 
clause-like units that are unequivocally the NU- 
CLEUS or SATELLITE of a rhetorical relation that 
adds some significant information to the text. For 
example, because of the low atmospheric pressure 
in text (2) is not a fully fleshed clause. However, 
since it is the SATELLITE of an EXPLANATION rela- 
tion, it should be treated as elementary. 
\[Only the midday sun at tropical atitudes (2) 
is warm enough\] [to thaw ice on occa- 
sion,\] \[but any liquid water formed in 
this way would evaporate almost instantly\] 
\[because ofthe low atmospheric pressure.\] 
A total of 70 rhetorical relations were partitioned 
into clusters, each cluster containing a subset of re- 
lations that shared some rhetorical meaning. For 
example, one cluster contained the contrast-like 
rhetorical relations of ANTITHESIS, CONTRAST, 
and CONCESSION. Another cluster contained REA- 
SON, EVIDENCE, and EXPLANATION. Each rela- 
tion was paired with an informal definition given in 
the style of Mann and Thompson (1988) and Moser 
and Moore (1997) and one or more examples. No 
explicit distinction was made between intentional 
and informational relations. In addition, we also 
marked two constituency relations that were ubiqui- 
tous in our corpora nd that often subsumed com- 
plex rhetorical constituents, and one textual rela- 
tion. The constituency relations were ATTRIBUTION, 
which was used to label the relation between a re- 
porting and a reported clause, and APPOSITION. The 
textual relation was TEXTUALORGANIZATION; it 
was used to connect in an RST-like manner the tex- 
tual spans that corresponded to the title, author, and 
textual body of each document in the corpus. We 
also enabled the annotators touse the label OTHER- 
RELATION whenever they felt that no relation in the 
manual captured sufficiently well the meaning of a 
rhetorical relation that held between two text spans. 
In an attempt to manage the inherent rhetorical 
ambiguity of texts, we also devised a protocol that 
listed the clusters of relations in decreasing order of 
specificity. Hence, the relations at the beginning of 
the protocol were more specific than the relations 
at the end of the protocol. The protocol specified 
that in assigning rhetorical relations judges should 
choose the first relation in the protocol whose def- 
inition was consistent with the case under consid- 
eration. For example, it is often the case that when 
an EVIDENCE relation holds between two segments, 
an ELABORATION relation holds as well. Because 
EVII~ENCE is more specific than ELABORATION, it 
comes first in the protocol, and hence, whenever 
both of these relations hold, only EVIDENCE is sup- 
posed to be used for tagging. 
The protocol specified that the rhetorical tagging 
should be performed incrementally. That is, if an 
annotator c eated an edu at time t and if she knew 
how to attach that edu to the discourse structure, she 
was supposed to do so at time t + 1. If the text read 
up to time t did not warrant such a decision, the 
annotator was supposed to determine the edus of the 
subsequent text and complete the construction ofthe 
discourse structure as soon as sufficient information 
became available. 
2_3 Materials and method 
Since we were aware of no previous tudy that in- 
vestigated thoroughly the coverage of any set of 
rhetorical relations or any protocol, we felt neces- 
sary to divide the experiment into a training and an 
annotation stage. During the training stage, each 
of us built the discourse structures of 10 texts that 
varied in size from 162 to 1924 words. The texts 
belonged to the news story, editorial, and scientific 
genres. We had extensive discussions after the tag- 
ging of each text. During these discussions, we 
refined the definition of edu, the definitions and 
number of rhetorical relations that we used, and 
the order of the relations in the protocol. Eventu- 
ally, our protocol comprised 50 mononuclear rela- 
tions and 23 multinuclear relations. All relations 
were divided into 23 clusters of rhetorical similarity

Table 1: Distribution of the most frequent rhetorical relations in each of the three corpora. 
(see (Marcu, 1998) for the complete list of rhetori- 
cal relations and protocol). 
During the annotation stage, we independently 
built the discourse structures of 90 texts by follow- 
ing the instructions in the protocol; 30 texts were 
taken from the MUC7 co-reference corpus, 30 texts 
from the Brown-Learned corpus, and 30 texts from 
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. The MUC 
corpus contained news stories about changes in cor- 
porate xecutive management personnel; the Brown 
corpus contained long, highly elaborate scientific 
articles; and the WSJ corpus contained editorials. 
The average number of words for each text was 405 
in the MUC corpus, 2029 in the Brown corpus, and 
878 in the WSJ corpus. The average number ofedus 
in each text was 52 in the MUC corpus, 170 in the 
Brown corpus, and 95 in the WSJ corpus. Each of 
the MUC texts was tagged by all three of us; each 
of the Brown and WSJ texts was tagged by only two 
of us. Table 1 shows the 15 relations that were used 
most frequently by annotators in each of the three 
corpora; the associated percentages reflect averages 
computed over all annotators. The table also shows 
the percentage ofcases in which the annotators used 
the label OTHER-RELAT1 ON. 
Problems with the method. It has been argued 
that the reliability of a coding schema can be as- 
sessed only on the basis of judgments made by 
naive coders (Carletta, 1996). Although we agree 
with this, we believe that more experiments of the 
kind reported here will have to be carried out before 
we can produce a tagging manual that is usable by 
naive coders. In our experiment, it is not clear how 
much of the agreement came from the manual and 
how much from the common understanding that we 
reached uring the training session. For our annota- 
tion task, we felt that it was more important to arrive 
at a common understanding instead of tightly con- 
trolling how this understanding was reached. This 
position was taken by other computational linguists 
as well (Carletta et al, 1997, p. 25). 
3 Computing agreement among judges 
We computed agreement figures with respect to the 
way we set up edu boundaries and the way we built 
hierarchical discourse structures of texts. 
3.1 Reliability of tagging the edu and 
parenthetical unit boundaries 
In order to compute how well we agreed on deter- 
mining the edu and parenthetical unit boundaries, 
we used the kappa coefficient k (Siegel and Castel- 
lan, 1988), a statistic used extensively in previous 
empirical studies of discourse. The kappa coeffi- 
cient measures palrwise agreement among a set of 
coders who make category judgements, correcting 
for chance xpected agreement (see equation (3) he- 
low, where P(A) is the proportion of times a set of 
coders agree and P(E) is the proportion of times a 
set of coders are expected to agree by chance). 
k -~ P(A) - P(E) (3) 
1 -  P (E )  
Carletta (1996) suggests that the units over which 
the kappa statistic is computed affects the outcome. 
To account for this, we computed the kappa statis- 
tics in two ways: 
51 
1. The first statistic, kw, reflects inter-annotator 
agreement under the assumption that edu and 
parenthetical unit boundaries can be inserted 
after any word in a text. Because many of 
the words occur within units and not at their 
boundaries, the chance agreement is very high, 
and therefore, k~ tends to be higher than the 
statistic discussed below. 
2. The second statistic, ku, reflects inter- 
annotator agreement under the assumption that 
edu and parenthetical unit boundaries can oc- 
cur only at locations judged to be boundaries 
by at least one annotator. This statistic offers 
the most conservative measure of agreement. 
3.2 Reliability of tagging the discourse 
structure of texts 
3.2.1 Previous work 
We are aware of only one proposal for computing 
agreement with respect o the way human judges 
construct hierarchical structures, that of Flammia 
and Zue (1995). This proposal appears to be ade- 
quate for computing the observed agreement, but it 
provides only a lower bound on the chance agree- 
ment, and hence, only an upper bound on the kappa 
coefficient. With the exception of Flammia and 
Zue, other esearchers elied primarily on cascaded 
schemata for computing agreement among hierar- 
chical structures. For example, Carletta et al (1997) 
computed agreement on a coarse segmentation level 
that was constructed on the top of finer segments, 
by determining how well coders agreed on where 
the coarse segments started, and, for agreed starts, 
by computing how coders agreed on where coarse 
segments ended. Moser and Moore (1997) deter- 
mined first the kappa coefficient with respect to the 
way judges assigned boundaries at the highest level 
of segmentation. Then judges met and agreed on a 
particular segmentation. Each high-level segment 
was then independently broken into smaller seg- 
ments and the process was repeated recursively un- 
til the elementary unit level was reached. Although 
Moser and Moore's approach accommodates read- 
ily the traditional computation of kappa, it is im- 
practical for large texts. In addition, since judges 
meet and agree on every level, it is likely that the 
agreement at finer levels of detail is influenced by 
judges' interaction. 
3.2.2 Our approach 
In order to compute the kappa statistics we devised 
a new method whose core idea is to map hierar- 
chical structures into sets of units that are labeled 
with categorial judgments (see (Marcu and Hovy, 
1999) for details). Consider, for example, the two 
hierarchical structures shown in figure 2.a, in which 
for simplicity, we focus only on the nuclear status 
of each segment (Nucleus or Satellite). In order to 
enable the computation of the kappa agreement we 
take as elementary all textual units found between 
two consecutive t xtual boundaries, independent of
whether one or multiple judges chose those bound- 
aries. Hence, for the segmentations in figure 2.a we 
consider that the text is made of 7 units;judge 1took 
as elementary segments \[0,1 \], \[2,2\], \[3,3\], \[4,5\] and 
\[6,6\], while judge 2 took as elementary segments 
\[0,0\], \[1,1\], \[2,2\], \[3,3\], \[4,4\] and \[5,6\]. 
The mapping between the hierarchical structure 
and a set of units labeled with categorial judgments 
is straightforward if we consider not only the seg- 
ments that play an active role in the structure (the 
nuclei and the satellites) but also the segments that 
are hot explicitly represented. For example, for seg- 
mentation 1, there is no active segment across units 
\[2,4\], \[2,5\], and \[2,6\]. Similarly, for segmentation 
2, there is no active segment across units \[4,5\] and 
\[6,6\]. By associating the label NONE to the textual 
units that do not play an active role in a hierarchi- 
cal representation, each discourse structure can be 
mapped into a set that explicitly enumerates all pos- 
sible spans that range over the units in the text. For 
a text of n units there are n spans of length 1, n - 1 
spans of length 2 . . . . .  and 1 span of length n. Hence, 
each hierarchical structure of n units can be mapped 
intoa set of n+ (n -  1 )+. . .  + 1 = n(n+ 1)/2 units, 
each labeled with a categorial judgment. And com- 
puting the kappa statistic for such sets is a prob- 
lem with a textbook solution (Siegel and Castellan, 
1988). 
In the example in figure 2, we therefore compute 
the kappa statistics between the two hierarchies by 
computing the kappa statistics between the two sets 
that are represented in figure 2.b. 
The hierarchical structures in figure 2 correspond 
to nuclearity judgments. However, the schema we 
use here is general, since it can accommodate he 
computation of kappa statistic for judgments at the 
segmentation a d rhetorical levels as well. In fact, 
the schema can be applied to any discourse, syntac- 
tic, or semantic hierarchical labeling. 
In our experiment, we computed the kappa statis- 
tic with respect to four categorial judgments:

We chose to compute krr in order to estimate 
whether the confusion in assigning rhetorical rela- 
tions lay within the clusters or across them. 
Problems with the proposed method. In inter- 
preting the statistical Significance of the results re- 
ported in this paper, the readers hould bear in mind 
that the method we propose and use here is not per- 
fect. The biggest problem we perceive concerns the 
violation of the independence assumption between 
the categorial judgments hat are usually associated 
with the computation f the kappa statistics. Obvi- 
ously, in our proposal, since the decisions taken at 
2Some relations were used so rarely in our  corpus that we 
decided to cluster them into only one group  in spite o f  not be- 
longing to the same cluster o f  rhetorical  s imi lar i ty.  
one level in the tree affect decisions taken at other 
levels in the tree, the data points over which the 
kappa coefficient is computed are not independent. 
However, it is not clear what the effect on kappa 
this interdependence has: if two judges agree, for 
example, on the labels associated with two large 
spans, they automatically agree on many other spans 
that do not play an active role in the representa- 
tion. When this happens, it is likely that the value of 
kappa increases. However, if two judges disagree on 
two high-level spans, they automatically disagree on 
other spans that play an active role in the representa- 
tion. When this happens, it is likely that the value of 
kappa decreases. Therefore, it is not very clear how 
much the final value of kappa is skewed in one di- 
rection or another. Most likely, if two judges agree 
significantly, the kappa coefficient will be skewed to 
higher values; if two judges disagree significantly, 
the kappa coefficient will be skewed to smaller val- 
t ies .  
Another problem concerns the effect of NONE- 
agreements onthe computation ofkappa. Although 
the kappa statistics makes corrections for chance 
agreement, it is likely that the kappa coefficient 
is "artificially" high, because of the large numbers 
of non-active spans that are labelled NONE. Typi- 
cally, a hierarchical structure with n leaves will be 
mapped into n(n + 1)/2 categorial judgments, of 
53 
which only 2n - 1 have values different than NONE. 
Hence, it is possible the kappa coefficient to be "ar- 
tificially" high because of many agreements onnon- 
active spans. However, the interdependence effect 
discussed above may equally well "artificially" de- 
crease the value of the kappa coefficient. One may 
imagine variants of our method in which all NONE- 
NONE agreements are eliminated, or in which only 
2n - 1 are preserved. The first variant may be in- 
felicitous because its adoption may artificially pre- 
vent judges to agree on NONE labels. Adopting 
the second variant is problematic because we don't 
know exactly how many NONE labels to keep in the 
mapped representation. 
Another potential problem stems from assigning 
the same importance to agreements atall levels in 
the hierarchy. For some classes of problems, one 
may argue that achieving agreement a higher lev- 
els in the hierarchy should be more important than 
achieving agreement a lower levels. Obviously, the 
method we described here does not enable such an 
intuition to be properly accounted for. However, 
for the discourse annotation task, we are quite am- 
bivalent about his intuition. It is not clear to us 
whether we should consider the annotations that 
have high agreements with respect o large textual 
segments and low agreements with respect to small 
segments better than the annotations that have low 
agreements with respect o large textual segments 
and high agreements with respect to small segments. 
The first group of annotations would correspond to 
an ability to deal properly with global discourse 
phenomena, but no ability to deal with local dis- 
course phenomena. The second group of annota- 
tions would correspond to an ability to deal properly 
with local discourse phenomena, but no ability to 
deal with global discourse phenomena. Which one 
is "better"? The method we propose treats all spans 
equally. It is similar in this respect to the labeled re- 
call and precision methods used to evaluate parsers, 
for example, which also do not consider that it is 
more important to agree on high level constituents 
than low level constituents. 
The method we propose does not enable one to 
assess agreement a different levels of granularity; it 
produces one number, which cannot be used to di- 
agnose where the disagreements are coming from. 
Although we believe that cascade techniques that 
were used to measure agreement between hierar- 
chies (Moser and Moore, 1997; Carletta et al, 1997) 
are more adequate for diagnosing problems in the 
annotation, we found these techniques difficult to 
apply on our data. Some of our trees have more 
than 200 elementary units; and carrying out and in- 
terpreting a cascade analysis at potentially 200 lev- 
els of granularity is not straightforward either. 
Another choice for computing agreement of hi- 
erarchical annotations would be to devise a method 
similar to that used in the Kendall's 7- statistic, in 
which one computes the minimal number of op- 
erations that can map one annotation i to another. 
Since the problem of finding the minimal number 
of operations that rewrite a tree into another tree 
is NP-complete, devising an operational method for 
computing agreement does not seem computation- 
ally feasible. After all, the number of possible trees 
that can be built for a text with 200 units is a number 
larger than 1 followed by 110 zeroes. 
3.3 Tagging consistency 
For each corpus, table 2 displays the numbers of 
coders that annotated each text in the corpus (#c) 
and the average numbers of data points (N~ and 
N~) over which the kappas were computed for each 
text in the corpus. In the first three rows, the table 
also shows the average kappa statistics computed 
for each text in the corpus with respect o judges' 
ability to agree on elementary discourse boundaries 
(k~ and k~,) and the average value of the corre- 
sponding z statistics (zw and zu) that were com- 
puted to test the significance of kappa (Siegel and 
Castellan, 1988, p. 289). The last three rows show 
the same statistics computed over all data points in 
each corpus. 
The field of content analysis uggests that values 
of k higher than 0.6 indicate good agreement. Val- 
ues of z that are higher than 2.32 correspond to sig- 
nificance levels that are higher than a = 0.01. The 
results in table 2 indicate that high, statistically sig- 
nificant agreement was achieved for all three cor- 
pora with respect to the task of determining the ele- 
mentary discourse units. 
For each corpus, table 3 displays in its first three 
rows the number of coders (#c) that annotated the 
texts and the average number of points (N) over 
which the agreements were computed for each text 
in the corpus. In the first three rows, the table dis- 
plays the average kappa statistics with respect to the 
judges' ability to agree on each text on discourse 
segmentation, ks, nuclearity assignments, kn, and 
rhetorical relation assignments, kr and kr~. In the 
last three rows, the table displays the kappa statistics 
computed over all the data points in each corpus. If

Table 3: Inter-annotator agreem6nt - - discourse trees. 
the statistical method we proposed oes not skew 
the values of k - -  a fact that we have not demon- 
strated - -  the data in table 3 suggest that reliable 
agreement is obtained across all three corpora with 
respect to the assignment ofdiscourse segments and 
nuclear statuses. Reliable agreement is obtained 
with respect to the rhetorical labeling only for the 
MUC corpus. The results in table 3 also show that 
a significant reduction in the size of the taxonomy 
of relations may not have a significant impact on 
agreement (k~T is only about 4% higher than k~). 
This suggests that choosing one relation from a set 
of rhetorically similar relations produces ome, but 
not too much, confusion. However, it may also sug- 
gest hat it is more difficult o assess where to attach 
an edu in a discourse tree than what relation to use. 
The results in tables 2 and 3 also show that the 
agreement figures vary significantly from one cor- 
pus to another: the news story genre of the MUC 
texts yields higher agreement figures than the edi- 
torial genre of the WSJ texts, which yields higher 
agreement figures than the scientific genre of the 
Brown texts. One possible xplanation is that some 
of the Brown texts, which dealt with advanced top- 
ics in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, were 
difficult o understand. 
Overall, if our method for computing the kappa 
statistic is not skewed towards higher values, our 
experiment suggests that even simple, intuitive def- 
initions of rhetorical relations, textual saliency, and 
discourse structure can lead to reliable annotation 
schemata. However, the results do not exclude that 
better definitions of edu and parenthetical units and 
rhetorical relations can lead to significant improve- 
ments in the reliability scores. 
4 Tagging style 
The vast majority of the computational pproaches 
to discourse parsing rely on models that implic- 
itly or explicitly assume that parsing is incremen- 
tal (Polanyi, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; 
Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997; van den Berg, 1996; 
Cristea and Webber, 1997). That is, as edus are 
processed, they are immediately added to one par- 
tial discourse structure that subsumes all previous 
text. However, the logs of our experiment show that, 
quite often, annotators axe unable to decide where 
to attach a newly created edu. The annotation style 
varies significantly among annotators; but neverthe- 
less, even the most aggressive annotator still needs 
to postpone 9.2% of the time the decision of where 
to attach anewly created edu (see table 4). Note that 
this percentage does not reflect UNDO steps, which 
may also correlate with attachment decisions that 
are eventually proven to be incorrect. 2 
We noticed that managing multiple partial dis- 
2UNDO operations may reflect ypo-like rrors'as well.

course trees during the annotation process is the 
norm rather than the exception. In fact it is not 
that edus are attached incrementally to one partial 
discourse structure, although the annotators were 
asked to do so, but rather that multiple partial dis- 
course structures are created and then assembled 
using a rich variety of operations, which are spe- 
cific to tree-adjoining and bottom-up arsers. More- 
over, even this strategy proves to be somewhat inad- 
equate, since annotators need from time to time to 
change rhetorical relation labels (2-3% of the op- 
erations) and re-structure completely the discourse 
(1-2% of the operations). 
This data suggests that it is unlikely that we will 
be able to build perfect discourse parsers that can in- 
crementally derive discourse trees without applying 
any form of backtracking. If humans are unable to 
decide incrementally, in 100% of the cases, where to 
attach the edus, it is unlikely we can build computer 
programs that are.
