Abstract
Unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging has recently been shown to greatly
benefit from Bayesian approaches where
HMM parameters are integrated out, lead-
ing to significant increases in tagging ac-
curacy. These improvements in unsuper-
vised methods are important especially in
specialized social media domains such as
Twitter where little training data is avail-
able. Here, we take the Bayesian approach
one step further by integrating semantic in-
formation from an LDA-like topic model
with an HMM. Specifically, we present
Part-of-Speech LDA (POSLDA), a syntac-
tically and semantically consistent genera-
tive probabilistic model. This model dis-
covers POS specific topics from an unla-
belled corpus. We show that this model
consistently achieves improvements in un-
supervised POS tagging and language mod-
eling over the Bayesian HMM approach
with varying amounts of side information
in the noisy and esoteric domain of Twitter.
1 Introduction
The explosion of social media in recent years has
led to the need for NLP tools like part-of-speech
(POS) taggers that are robust enough to handle
data that is becoming increasingly ?noisy.? Unfor-
tunately, many NLP systems fail at out-of-domain
data and struggle with the informal style of social
text. With spelling errors, abbreviations, uncom-
mon acronyms, and excessive use of slang, sys-
tems that are designed for traditional corpora such
as news articles may perform poorly when given
difficult input such as a Twitter feed (Ritter et al.,
2010).
Recognizing the limitations of existing sys-
tems, Gimpel et al. (2011) develop a POS tagger
specifically for Twitter, by creating a training cor-
pus as well as devising a tag set that includes parts
of speech that are uniquely found in online lan-
guage, such as emoticons (smilies). This is an im-
portant step forward, but a POS tagger tailored to
Twitter cannot tackle the social Web as a whole.
Other online communities have their own styles,
slang, memes, and other idiosyncrasies, so a sys-
tem trained for one community may not apply to
others.
For example, the 140-character limit of Twit-
ter encourages abbreviations and word-dropping
that may not be found in less restrictive venues.
The first-person subject is often assumed in ?sta-
tus messages? that one finds in Twitter and Face-
book, so the pronominal subject can be dropped,
even in English (Weir, 2012), leading to messages
like ?Went out? instead of ?I went out.? Not
only does Twitter follow these unusual grammat-
ical patterns, but many messages contain ?hash-
tags? which could be considered their own syn-
tactic class not found in other data sources. For
these reasons, POS parameters learned from Twit-
ter data will not necessarily fit other social data.
In general, concerns about the limitations of
domain-dependent models have motivated the use
of sophisticated unsupervised methods. Inter-
est in unsupervised POS induction has been re-
vived in recent years after Bayesian HMMs are
shown to increase accuracy by up to 14 percent-
age points over basic maximum-likelihood esti-
mation (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007). Despite
falling well short of the accuracy obtained with
supervised taggers, unsupervised approaches are
preferred in situations where there is no access to
1
large quantities of training data in a specific do-
main, which is increasingly common with Web
data. We therefore hope to continue improving
accuracy with unsupervised approaches by intro-
ducing semantics as an additional source of infor-
mation for this task.
The ambiguities of language are amplified
through social media, where new words or
spellings of words are routinely invented. For ex-
ample, ?ow? on Twitter can be a shorthand for
?how,? in addition to its more traditional use as
an expression of pain (ouch). While POS assign-
ment is inherently a problem of syntactic disam-
biguation, we hypothesize that the underlying se-
mantic content can aid the disambiguation task.
If we know that the overall content of a message
is about police, then the word ?cop? is likely to
be a noun, whereas if the context is about shop-
ping, this could be slang for acquiring or stealing
(verb). The HMM approach will often be able to
tag these occurrences appropriately given the con-
text, but in many cases the syntactic context may
be limited or misleading due to the noisy nature
of the data. Thus, we believe that semantic con-
text will offer additional evidence toward making
an accurate prediction.
Following this intuition, this paper presents a
semantically and syntactically coherent Bayesian
model that uncovers POS-specific sub-topics
within general semantic topics, as in latent Dirich-
let allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), which we
call part-of-speech LDA, or POSLDA. The re-
sulting posterior distributions will reflect special-
ized topics such as ?verbs about dining? or ?nouns
about politics?. To the best of our knowledge, we
also present the first experiments with unsuper-
vised tagging for a social media corpus. In this
work, we focus on Twitter because the labeled
corpus by Gimpel et al. (2011) allows us to quan-
titatively evaluate our approach. We demonstrate
the model?s utility as a predictive language model
by its low perplexity on held-out test data as com-
pared to several related topic models, and most
importantly, we show that this model achieves
statistically significant and consistent improve-
ments in unsupervised POS tagging accuracy over
a Bayesian HMM. These results support our hy-
pothesis that semantic information can directly
improve the quality of POS induction, and our ex-
periments present an in-depth exploration of this
task on informal social text.
The next section discusses related work, which
is followed by a description of our model,
POSLDA. We then present POS tagging results
on the Twitter POS dataset (Gimpel et al., 2011).
Section 5 describes further experiments on the
POSLDA model and section 6 includes a discus-
sion on the results and why POSLDA can do bet-
ter on POS tagging than a vanilla Bayesian HMM.
Finally, section 7 concludes with a discussion on
future work.
2 Related Work
Modern unsupervised POS tagging originates
with Merialdo (1993) who trained a trigram
HMM using maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE). Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) improved
upon this approach by treating the HMM in a
Bayesian sense; the rows of the transition matrix
are random variables with proper Bayesian priors
and the state emission probabilities are also ran-
dom variables with their own priors. The posterior
distribution of tags is learned using Gibbs sam-
pling and this model improves in accuracy over
the MLE approach by up to 14 percentage points.
In the ?Topics and Syntax? model (or
HMMLDA), the generative process of a corpus
is cast as a composite model where syntax is
modeled with an HMM and semantics are mod-
eled with LDA (Griffiths et al., 2005). Here, one
state of an HMM is replaced with a topic model
such that the words with long-range dependen-
cies (?content? words) will be drawn from a set
of topics. The remaining states are reserved for
?syntax? words that exhibit only short-range de-
pendencies. Griffiths et al. (2005) briefly touch
on POS tagging with their model, but its supe-
riority to a plain Bayesian HMM is not shown
and the authors note that this is partially because
all semantic-like words get assigned to the sin-
gle semantic class in their model. This misses the
distinction between at least nouns and verbs, but
many other semantic-dependent words as well. If
more variation could be provided in the seman-
tic portion of the model, the POS tagging results
would likely improve.
3 Part-of-Speech LDA (POSLDA)
In their canonical form, topic models do not cap-
ture local dependencies between words (i.e. syn-
tactic relations), but they do capture long-range

context such as the overall topical content or gist
of a document. Conversely, under an HMM,
words are assumed completely independent of
their broader context by the Markov assumption.
We seek to bridge these restrictions with our uni-
fied model, Part-of-Speech LDA (POSLDA).
Under this model, each word token is now asso-
ciated with two latent variables: a semantic topic
z and a syntactic class c. We posit that the top-
ics are generated through the LDA process, while
the classes are generated through an HMM. The
observed word tokens are then dependent on both
the topic and the class: rather than a single multi-
nomial for a particular topic z or a particular class
c, there are distributions for each topic-class pair
(z, c) from which we assume words are sampled.
We denote the set of classes C = CCON ? CFUN,
which includes the set of content or ?semantic?
classes CCON for word types such as nouns and
verbs that depend on the current topic, and func-
tional or ?syntactic-only? classes CFUN. If a word
is generated from a functional class, it does not
depend on the topic. This allows our model to
accommodate functional words like determiners
which appear independently of the topical content
of a document.
We use the same notation as LDA, where ? is a
document-topic distribution and ? is a topic-word
distribution. Additionally, we denote the HMM
transition rows as pi, which we assume is drawn
from a Dirichlet with hyperparameter ?. Denote
S = |C| and K = |Z|, the numbers of classes
and topics, respectively. There are SFUN word
distributions ?(FUN) for function word classes and
K ? SCON word distributions ?(CON) for content
word classes. A graphical model depiction of
POSLDA is shown in Figure 1.
Thus, the generative process of a corpus can be
described as:
1. Draw pi ? Dirichlet(?)
2. Draw ? ? Dirichlet(?)
3. For each document d ? D:
(a) Draw ?d ? Dirichlet(?)
(b) For each word token wi ? d:
i. Draw ci ? pici?1
ii. If ci /? CCON:
A. Draw wi ? ?
(FUN)
ci
iii. Else:
A. Draw zi ? ?d
B. Draw wi ? ?
(CON)
ci,zi
In topic models, it is generally true that com-
mon function words may overwhelm the word
distributions, leading to suboptimal results that
are difficult to interpret. This is usually accom-
modated by data pre-processing (e.g. stop word
removal), by backing off to ?background? word
models (Chemudugunta et al., 2006), or by per-
forming term re-weighting (Wilson and Chew,
2010). In the case of POSLDA, these common
words are naturally captured by the functional
classes.
3.1 Relations to Other Models
The idea of having multinomials for the cross
products of topics and classes is related to multi-
faceted topic models where word tokens are as-
sociated with multiple latent variables (Paul and
Girju, 2010; Ahmed and Xing, 2010). Under such
models, words can be explained by a latent topic
as well as a second underlying variable such as
the perspective or dialect of the author, and words
may depend on both factors. In our case, the sec-
ond variable is the part-of-speech ? or functional
purpose ? of the token.
We note that POSLDA is a generalization of
many existing models. POSLDA becomes a
Bayesian HMM when the number of topics K =
1; the original LDA model when the number of
3
classes S = 1; and the HMMLDA model of Grif-
fiths et al. (2005) when the number of content
word classes SCON = 1. The beauty of these gen-
eralizations is that one can easily experiment with
any of these models by simply altering the model
parameters under a single POSLDA implementa-
tion.
3.2 Inference
As with many complex probabilistic models, ex-
act posterior inference is intractable for POSLDA.
Nevertheless, a number of approximate inference
techniques are at our disposal. In this work, we
use collapsed Gibbs sampling to sample the latent
class assignments and topic assignments (c and
z), and from these we can compute estimates of
the multinomial parameters for the topics (?), the
document-topic portions (?), and the HMM tran-
sition matrix (pi). Under a trigram version of the
model ? which we employ for all our experiments
in this work ? the sampling equation for word to-
ken i is as follows:
p(ci, zi|c?i, z?i,w) ?
?
??
??
?ci ?
n(d)zi +?zi
n(d). +?.
n
(ci,zi)
w +?
n(ci,zi). +W?
ci ? SCON
?ci ?
n
(ci)
w +?
n(ci). +W?
ci ? SFUN
where
?ci =
n(ci?2,ci?1,ci)+?ci
n(ci?2,ci?1)+?.
?
n(ci?1,ci,ci+1)+?ci
n(ci?1,ci)+?.
?
n(ci,ci+1,ci+2)+?ci
n(ci,ci+1)+?.
Although we sample the pair (ci, zi) jointly as a
block, which requires computing a sampling dis-
tribution over SFUN +K ?SCON, it is also valid to
sample ci and zi separately, which requires only
S + K computations. In this case, the sampling
procedure would be somewhat different. Despite
the lower number of computations per iteration,
however, the sampler is likely to converge faster
with our blocked approach because the two vari-
ables are tightly coupled. The intuition is that a
non-block-based sampler could have difficulty es-
caping local optima because we are interested in
the most probable pair; a highly probable class
c sampled on its own, for example, could pre-
vent the sampler from choosing a more likely pair
(c?, z).
4 POS Tagging Experiments
To demonstrate the veracity of our approach, we
performed a number of POS tagging experiments
using the POSLDA model. Our data is the re-
cent Twitter POS dataset released at ACL 2011 by
Gimpel et al. (2011) consisting of approximately
26,000 words across 1,827 tweets. This dataset
provides a unique opportunity to test our unsuper-
vised approach in a domain where it would likely
be of most use ? one that is novel and therefore
lacking large amounts of training data. We feel
that this sort of specialized domain will become
the norm ? particularly in social media analysis
? as user generated content continues to grow in
size and accessibility. The Twitter dataset uses a
domain-dependent tag set of 25 tags that are de-
scribed in (Gimpel et al., 2011).
For our experiments, we follow the established
form of Merialdo (1993) and Goldwater and Grif-
fiths (2007) for unsupervised POS tagging by
making use of a tag dictionary to constrain the
possible tag choices for each word and there-
fore render the problem closer to disambiguation.
Like Goldwater and Griffiths (2007), we employ
a number of dictionaries with varying degrees of
knowledge.
We use the full corpus of tweets1 and construct
a tag dictionary which contains the tag informa-
tion for a word only when it appears more than d
times in the corpus. We ran experiments for d =
1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and ? where the problem becomes
POS clustering. We report both tagging accu-
racy and the variation of information (VI), which
computes the information lost in moving from
one clustering C to another C ?: V I(C,C ?) =
H(C) +H(C ?)? 2I(C,C ?) (Meila?, 2007). This
can be interpreted as a measure of similarity be-
tween the clusterings, where a smaller value indi-
cates higher similarity.
We run our Gibbs sampler for 20,000 iterations
and obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) esti-
mate for each word?s tag by employing simulated
annealing. Each posterior probability p(c, z|?) in
the sampling distribution is raised to the power of
1
? where ? is a temperature that approaches 0 as
the sampler converges. This approach is akin to
1The Twitter POS dataset consists of three subsets of
tweets: development, training, and testing. Because we are
performing fully unsupervised tagging, however, we com-
bine these three subsets into one.

with the lowest energy, thus viewing the Gibbs
sampling procedure as a random search whose
goal is to identify the MAP tag sequence ? a tech-
nique that is also employed by Goldwater and
Griffiths (2007). Finally, we run each experiment
5 times from random initializations and report the
average accuracy and variation of information.
4.1 Results for Twitter Dataset
In our experiments, we use 8 content classes
that correspond to the following parts-of-speech:
noun, proper noun, proper noun + possessive,
proper noun + verbal, verb, adjective, adverb, and
other abbreviations / foreign words. We chose
these classes because intuitively they are the types
of words whose generative probability will de-
pend on the given latent topic. As the Twitter POS
data consists of 25 distinct tags, this leaves 17 re-
maining classes for function words. In this sec-
tion, we report results for K = 10 topics. We
will discuss the effect of varyingK in section 4.2.
We set symmetric priors with ? = 1.0/K = 0.1,
? = 0.5, and ? = 0.01.
As is demonstrated in Table 1, our POSLDA
model shows marked improvements over a ran-
dom tag assignment and, more importantly, the
Bayesian HMM approach described by Goldwa-
ter and Griffiths (2007). It does so for every set-
ting of d on both accuracy and variation of infor-
mation. For d = 1 our method outperforms the
BHMM by 2.5 percentage points. With higher
values of d, however, POSLDA increases its im-
provement over the BHMM to up to 4.1 percent-
age points. The increase in tagging accuracy as
d increases suggests that our method may be par-
ticularly suitable for domains with little training

data.2 For d = ?, where we are performing
POS clustering, our model improves the variation
of information by 0.11. Each of these improve-
ments over the Bayesian HMM is statistically sig-
nificant with p  0.01. Despite the clear im-
provements in POS tagging accuracy and cluster-
ing that we demonstrate in this section, we trained
our POSLDA model with a ?blind? topic setting
of K = 10. In the following section, we will
investigate how this parameter affects the achiev-
able results with our technique.
4.2 Topic Variance
In the previous section we set the number of topics
a priori to K = 10. However, it is well known in
topic modeling research that different datasets ex-
hibit different numbers of ?inherent? topics (Blei
et al., 2003). Therefore, a POSLDA model fit with
the ?correct? number of topics will likely achieve
higher accuracy in POS tagging. A standard ap-
proach to tuning the number of topics to fit a topic
model is to try a number of different topics and
choose the one that results in the lowest perplexity
on a held-out test set (Claeskens and Hjort, 2008).
Here, we can choose the optimal K more directly
by trying a number of different values and choos-
ing the one that maximizes the POS tagging accu-
racy.
For this experiment, we again make use of the
Twitter POS dataset (Gimpel et al., 2011). We use
the same setup as that described above with sim-
ulated annealing, 20,000 iterations, and a tag dic-

centage points between POSLDA and the BHMM for
d = {1, 2, 3, 5, 10} are ?a = {2.5, 2.1, 3.0, 4.1, 3.6},
respectively. For clustering, the increases in VI are
even more clear as d increases. They are ?V I =

tionary with d = 1. As before, we set ? = 1.0/K,
? = 0.5, and ? = 0.01. We perform experiments
with K = {1, 5, 10, . . . , 40, 45}, where K = 1
corresponds to the Bayesian HMM. The results
averaged over 3 runs are tabulated in Table 2 with
the associated standard deviations (?), and shown
graphically in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Number of topics K vs. POS tagging ac-
curacy on the Twitter dataset. The average accuracies,
along with their standard errors, are shown in black,
while a smoothed curve of the same data is shown in
blue.
As we expect, the tagging accuracy depends on
the number of topics specified by the model. In
fact, the accuracy improves by nearly a full per-
centage point from both the previous and next
topic settings when we hit a critical point at
K = 10. When K = 1 the model reduces to
the Bayesian HMM and our accuracy suffers. It
steadily increases until we hit the critical point
and then drops off again but plateaus at a level
that is approximately 1.5 percentage points higher
than the BHMM. This shows that determining an
appropriate setting for the number of topics is es-
sential for the best possible tagging accuracy us-
ing POSLDA. Nevertheless, even with a ?blind?
setting within a large range of topic values (here
from K = 5 to at least K = 45), we see marked
improvements over the baseline system that does
not include any semantic topic information.
5 Model Evaluation
In this section we present further experiments
on the raw output of POSLDA to demonstrate
its capabilities beyond simply POS tagging. We
show the model?s ability both qualitatively and
quantitatively to capture the semantic (or ?con-
tent?) and syntactic (or ?functional?) axes of in-
formation prevalent in a corpus made up of social
media data. We begin qualitatively with topic in-
terpretability when the model is learned given a
collection of unannotated Twitter messages, and
then present quantitative results on the ability of
POSLDA as a predictive language model in the
Twitter domain.
5.1 Topic Interpretability
Judging the interpretability of a set of topics is
highly subjective, and there are understandably
various differing approaches of evaluating topic
cohesiveness. For example, Chang et al. (2009)
look at ?word intrusion? where a user determines
an intruding word from a set of words that does
not thematically fit with the other words, and
?topic intrusion? where a user determines whether
the learned document-topic portion ?d appropri-
ately describes the semantic theme of the doc-
ument. In this section, we are most interested
in subjectively demonstrating the low incidence
of ?word intrusion? both in terms of semantics
(theme) and syntax (part-of-speech). We do not
conduct formal experiments to demonstrate this,
but we subjectively show that our model learns
semantic and syntactic word distributions that are
likely robust towards problems of word intrusion
and that are therefore ?interpretable? for humans
examining the learned posterior word distribu-
tions.
Table 3 shows three topics ? manually la-
belled as ?party?, ?status update?, and ?politics?
? learned from the relatively small Twitter POS
dataset. We set the number of topics K = 20,
the number of classes S = 25, and the num-
ber of content word classes SCON = 8, following
our earlier POS tagging experiments. We show
the top five words from three POS-specific top-
ics labelled manually as noun, verb, and adjec-
tive. Given the relatively small size of the dataset,
the short length of the documents, and the eso-
teric language and grammar use, the interpretabil-
ity of the topics is reasonable. All three topics
assign high probability to words that one would

expect to have high importance with one or two
outliers. More importantly, however, the POS-
specific topics also generally reflect their syntac-
tic roles. Each of the verbs is assuredly (even
without the proper context) a verb (with the sin-
gle outlier being the word ?so?), and the same
thing for the nouns. The adjectives seem to fit
as well; though many of the words could be con-
sidered nouns depending on the context, it is clear
how given the topic each of the words could very
well act as an adjective. A final point worth
mentioning is that, unlike LDA, we do not per-
form stopword removal. Instead, the POSLDA
model has pushed stopwords to their own func-
tion classes (rather than content) freeing us from
having to perform pre- or post-processing steps
to ensure interpretable topics. The top words in
four of these topic-independent function classes,
learned from the Twitter POS dataset, are shown
in Table 4.3 These function word distributions are
even more cohesive than the content word distri-
butions, showing that the standard stopwords have
been accounted for as we expect in their respec-
tive function classes.
3Note that we make use of the tag dictionary when learn-
ing these word distributions.
5.2 Predictive Language Modeling
While we have demonstrated that our model can
achieve improved accuracy in POS tagging for
Twitter data, it can also be useful for other kinds
of language analysis in the social media do-
main. In the following experiments, we test the
POSLDA model quantitatively by determining its
ability as a predictive language model. Follow-
ing a standard practice in topic modeling research
(Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths et al., 2005), we fit a
model to a training set and then compute the per-
plexity of a held-out test set. For this experiment,
we use the Twitter POS training dataset described
earlier (16,348 words across 999 tweets). We then
perform testing on the Twitter POS testing dataset
(8,027 words across 500 tweets). We compare
the perplexity ? a monotonically decreasing func-
tion of the log likelihood ? to LDA, a Bayesian
HMM, and HMMLDA. Finally, we use Minka?s
fixed-point method (Wallach, 2008) to optimize
the hyperparameters ? and ?.

Figure 3 shows the perplexity on the held-out
Twitter test set for models trained with K =
{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30}. The Bayesian HMM is not
affected by the number of topics and is able to
beat the HMMLDA model at K = 5. It also
achieves lower perplexity than the LDA model at
K = 5, 25, and 30. Our POSLDA model, how-
ever, achieves the lowest perplexity of all tested
models at all topic settings that we tested. This
demonstrates that POSLDA is a good candidate
for both language modeling and for further la-
tent probabilistic model-based analysis of Twitter

In the previous section we demonstrated both
qualitatively and quantitatively that our model
captures two sources of information from unstruc-
tured texts: thematic (or semantics) and func-
tional (or syntactic). An important question to
consider is why ? as we demonstrated in sec-
tion 4 ? learning this sort of information im-
proves our ability to perform unsupervised POS
tagging. One reason is discussed in the introduc-
tion: semantic information can help disambiguate
the POS for a word that typically serves a differ-
ent function depending on the topic that it is nor-
mally associated with. This phenomenon likely
plays an important role in the accuracy improve-
ments that we observe. However, another feature
of the model is the distinction between ?content?
POS classes and ?function? POS classes. The for-
mer will depend on the current topic while the
latter are universal across thematic space. This
will also represent an improvement over the bare
HMM because words that depend on the cur-
rent topic ? typically nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs ? will be forced to these classes due
to their long-range thematic dependencies while
words with only short-range dependencies will be
pushed to the function POS classes. This latter
type of words ? conjunctions, determiners, etc.
? naturally do not depend on themes so as they
are pushed to the function-only POS classes, and
so one step of disambiguation has already been
performed. This is the same behaviour as in the
HMMLDA model by Griffiths et al. (2005), but
here we are able to perform proper POS tagging
because there is more than just a single content
word class and we are therefore able to discern
between the topic-dependent parts-of-speech.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have shown that incorporating
semantic topic information into a Bayesian HMM
can result in impressive increases in accuracy for
unsupervised POS tagging. Specifically, we pre-
sented POSLDA ? a topic model consistent across
the axes of both semantic and syntactic meanings.
Using this model to perform unsupervised POS
tagging results in consistent and statistically sig-
nificant increases in POS tagging accuracy and
decreases in variation of information when per-
forming POS clustering. These improvements are
demonstrated on a novel release of data from the
microblogging social network site Twitter. This
type of dataset is of particular interest because un-
supervised POS tagging will likely be most im-
portant in specialized idiosyncratic domains with
atypical features and small amounts of labelled
training data. Crucially, we showed that even
with the inconsistent and at times strange use of
grammar, slang, and acronyms, the syntactic por-
tion of the model demonstrably improves not only
the predictive ability of the model in terms of
perplexity, but also the accuracy in unsupervised
POS tagging. This is important because in gen-
eral tweets are far from being representative of
?proper? grammar. Nevertheless, there clearly ex-
ists some adherence to syntactic structure as the
use of the HMM within our model improves word
prediction and POS tagging.
This work represents the first ? to our knowl-
edge ? application of latent thematic information
to the unsupervised POS tagging task.4 How-
ever, due to the encouraging results, there are a
number of future research directions that present
themselves from this work. One immediate task is
to extend POSLDA to a nonparametric Bayesian
model. Section 4.2 shows how varying the num-
ber of topics K in the model can affect the tag-
ging accuracy by up to a full percentage point. A
nonparametric version of the model would free us
from having to perform the initial model selection
step to get the best accuracy. Another avenue for
future work is to infuse more structure into the
model such as word morphology.
4There has been some work done to include semantic in-
formation collected separately in a supervised POS tagging
approach (Toutanova and Johnson, 2008).
