Abstract: A formalism for ~he representation 
of "semantic emphases" is introduced, using 
principal and accessory instantiatiQns. It 
m~es  it possible to convert predicate ex- 
pressions inbo network-like structures. As 
an application criteria for ooligatory and 
optional actants are dealt with. 
I. The formal framework 
- A set X of objects, denoted by x, y, Zo 
- A set E of events, states, actions, ..., 
denoted by el, e2, .... 
- A set L of places, denoted by 11, 12, .... 
- A set T of intervals (span~or moments) on 
the time axis, denoted by tl, t2, .... 
- A se~ of functions f1' f2' ..o, which are 
mappings between the sets X, E, L and T. 
- A se~ of relaUions in E, L and T as e. g. 
e I ~e  2 (e I is a partial event, ... of e2J 
11 ~ 12, t I ~ t2, t I starts t2, 
t I finishes t 2 etco (Allen (1984); Bier- 
winch (1988) for the general framework). 
- Finally a set of primitive semantic predl- 
cares BI, B2, .o., ~hat may have as argu- 
ments elements of X, L and T as well as 
propositions A, ioe .  predicates B wluh 
their (aopropriate) arguments. 
While ~he elements of the first four sets 
have the character of variables, the func- 
tions, relations and predicates are fixed 
and interpreted in a characteristic way. 
We use here the following functions: 
loc(e) = l: The location of e is 1. 
~ime(e) = t: The time of e is to 
If e is a path, one may define Init(e) = e' 
and fln(e) = e" (cf. Bierwisch 41988)). One 
has time(inlt(e)) starts time(e) etc. 
We will use the following predicates: 
ACT(x) CAUSE(A 1 ,A 2) 
HAVE(x,y) CHANGE(A1,A2) (from A I ~o A 2) 
NOT (A) aT( A I , A 2) ( o onj unct i on) 
BECome(A) d~f CHANGE(NOT(A),A) 
On the basis of these formal components 
one has to give a definition of wellformed 
expressions. One needs furthermore an axiom 
system expressing the fundamental properties 
of the predicates. We skip this here? 
2. Instaatiations 
For each proposition A we assume an addi- 
tlonal argument place that is fi l led in by an 
element e of Eo We say that "e is an Instan- 
tiation of A" or "e instantiates A" and write 
A~\ ]  (Bierwisch (1988), Reichenbach (19#8))o 
We introduce here a distinction between 
two types of Instantiations, namely 
- principal instantiations, representing a 
semantic emphasis, denoted by e p, 
- accessory instantlations, denoted by eao 
For each primitive predicate in a given 
inventory one Instantiatlon rule has to be 
formulated. The rules are applied recurslvely 
and provide a means for "calculating" the 
Instantlations for complex propositions. The 
results are network-like structures consistq 
ing of conditions only on the level of the 
sets X, E, L and T. 
ACT(x) Is\]| e is an action of x. 
HAVE(x,y)\[e\] , e is a state, that involves 
x's having (owning, ...) of yo 
NOT(A) \[e\]$ a condition, that implies ~.&~e\]. 
It should be note~ that for concrete A's con- 
crete rules can be formulated (preserving 
presuppositions and certain arguments). 
In the next rules the index i = 1,2 indi- 
cates whether the first or the second argumen~ 
yields the principal Instantlation. For the 
index j = 1,2 we use ~he convention "j ? i"o 
CAUSEi(A1,A a) \[e\] : 
(e is a pair (el,e2)) ^ (A l \ [e~)  ^ (A2\[e2\]) ^ 
(e I causes e2) ^ (e i = e p) A (ej = e a) ^ 
(tlme(el) = tlme(e2) = time(e)) ^ 
(loc(e I) = loc(e 2) = lot(e)) 
This is the rule for simultaneous causation 
356 
where one has unity of time and place. 
CH~NGEi(A1,A2)\[e\]: 
(~ is a path) A( init(e) = el) ^ (fin(e) = e2)A 
(~21(AI,NOT(A~)) \[e~ ^  ET'(Aj,NOT(AI)) \[ej\] 
(e l  = ep) A (e~ = e a) 
This preserves the semantic emphasis on A i 
and allows a new index for the second ~\]T. 
From this rule one obtains the conditions for 
B~O 1(A) = CHANGE 1(NOT(A), A) (=CFASE(NOT(A) ) ) 
B\]6C2(A) = CHANGE2(NOT(A),A) (usual  BEC(A)). 
Note thai; ETk(A,A)\[e\] eq A\[eJ for all k, A 
and e, BEC has one "degree of freedom" lesso 
ETi(A 1 ~A 2 ) e : 
(e i = e ) A(  j = )^ 
(time(el) = time(e2) = time(e)) 
This way )~T becomes an unsymmetric predicate? 
3o Instanl;iations and actants 
We illust:eate the notions defined above by a 
sample of German verbs with three necessary 
actants: the source x, the goal z, end the 
(transferred) Object y. Under some simplifi- 
cations we may assume the following expres- 
slon-scheme as basic pattern for this group: 
( 1 ) O,~s~fl/a(ACT(x/z), 
CHANGE1/2(HAV~(x,y),HAVE(z,y))) 
In (1) 16 expressions are summarized, which 
one may obtain by choosing the upper index 
of CAUSE, the argument of AOT, the upper In- 
dex of CH~GE and the upper index of the sec- 
ond occurrence of ~ in the CHANGEi-~le.  
An occurrence of a predicate in an expres- 
sion representing a certain sememe is called 
an inhere~:,.t occurrence, if this occurrence 
has to be instantiated for a sufficlen~ de- 
scriptlon of ~hls sememe. The inherent occur~ 
fences have to fulfil some condi~ionsl 
The inheren~ occurrences ~e closed under 
principal instantiations: If B(..o,A,..o) 
is an i~herent  occurrence of B, and the 
predicate A yleids the principal insian- 
tia~ion of B, then the uppermost predicate 
of A is an inherent occurrence? 
The Inheren~ occurrences are closed bottom- 
up: if :In B(?..,A,...) the occurrence @f 
the upper.mos~ predicate of A is inherent, 
then th~ occurrence of B is ~mherento 
in (I) it is sufficient to mark (after thelr 
i~stan~ia~:\[e~) both occurrences of ET as pri- 
ma~ely i~1~rent occurrences (i. e. init(e) 
a~d fln(e) are necessary). For co~cre~e some- 
mes one may add further inherent occurrences 
in accordance with the afore~said conditions. 
The possibil it ies depend on the distribution 
of principal instantiationso 
Each element of X occurring in an expres- 
sion a role can be assigned tos 
- ACT( ) defines in (I) the role "agent". 
By spelling out the second argument of CAUSE 
in (1) without the details of Instantlatlons 
we obtain four partial conditions: 
HAVE(x,y) \[inlt(e)\] A NOT(HAVE(z,y)) \[init(e)\] 
NOT(HAVE(x,y)) \[fln(e)\] A HAVE(z,y) \[fin(e)\] 
Here e is the instantiation of CHANGE. 
- The occurrences of x in the first and the 
third partial expression define together 
the role "source" for Xo 
- The occurrences of z in the second and the 
fourth partial expression define together 
the role "goal" for Zo 
- The occurrences of y in the first and the 
fourth partial expression define together 
the role "object" for y. 
In this sense we may speak of role defin- 
ing occurrences. They are independent of the 
distribution of the hypes of insbantiations. 
Now we are able to formulate the follow- 
ing principle: 
(2) An actant is obligatory in a certain role 
iff all its defining occurrences for 
this role are direct arguments in inher- 
ent occurrences of predicates. 
In order to avoid mixing up surface and 
deep phenomena one should note thaS the argu- 
ments of ACT in (1) for the verbs considered 
under A. ~ H. are subjects (in active voice) 
and hence "obligatory". This assigmnent pre- 
dominates over (2) in passive voice, too: In 
C. the aciant z e. g. is according to (2) ob- 
ligatory as goal and agent, but being the 
subject in active voice, not obligatory in 
passive voice. The same applies for the sub- 
jects in passive voice. 
In (3) we list the first eight possibil i- 
ties of (1) with the following abbreviations 
in the corresponding columns: 
1. upper index of CAUSE 
2o argument 9f ACT 
3 .  upper index of CHANGE and the first ET 
4. upper index of the second ET 
5. distribution of source, object and goal 
according to (2) (optional: in brackets) 
357 
6. the principal instantions within the 
predicate CHANGE express an emphasis on 
BEC(NOT(HAVE(x,y))) : from 
BEC(HAVE(z,y)) ~ to 
one argument of CHANGE: from to 
7. distribution of the actants taking into 
account the agent in active voice 
(3) 1. 2. 3. ~. 5. G. 7. 
A. I z I ~ (x )y (z )  from to (x )y  z 
B. I z I 1 x(y(k)) from x(y)z 
c. 1 z 2 2 ( (x )y )z  to ( (x )y )z  
D. I z 2 I (x)y(z) from to (x)y z 
E. I x I 2 (x)y(z) from to x y(z) 
F. I x I I x(y(z) ) from x(y(z)) 
G. 1 x 2 2 ( (x )y )z  to x (y )z  
H. I x 2 I (x)y(z) from to x y(z) 
These eight possibilities refer to the fol- 
lowing German verbs (among many others): 
A. wegnehmen, abnehmen (take aw~/of_~f), 
entwenden ( ~ ,  filch) 
(~) Die Oma nasa (dem Baby) die Schere weg. 
(5) Er hat (der alien Frau) de~ schweren Kof- 
fer abgenommen. (so she needn't carry it) 
B. besteblen (ro_~b, steal from) 
(6) Er hat die Frau (um 1OOO Mark ) bestohlen. 
C. stehlen (steal) 
(7) Er hat ((der Frau) 1000 ~ark) gestohlen. 
D. annehmen ( ~ ~  (borrow) 
(8) Rr hat (yon der Frau) 1000 Mark geb orgt. 
(so he has some money now) 
E. verschenken (give aw~) ,  ~ ,  ausgebeq 
(give ou__~t, ~ ) ,  ausliefern (delive__~r), 
verleihen (lend (out)) 
(9) Gebe junge Katzen ab! (somebody wants to 
get rid of the kittens) 
(10) Hams ha~ das Spielzeug (an die Kinder) 
verschenkt. (so he has no toys any more) 
Fo liefern (delive_~r) 
(11) Die Firma liefert ~uns) das Papier). 
G. beschenken ( rp_~nt  s. o.), bellefern 
(furnis____~h, ~ )  
(12) Hans hat die Kinder (mit Spielzeug) be- 
schenkt. (so taey have some toys now) 
(13) Die Firma bellefert uns (mit Papier). 
H. schenken (make A present of s. th. ~o 
s. o_.__~.), lelhen (lend, not borrow) 
(I@) Hans schenkte (den Kindern) Spielzeug. 
There is some support for 6.  in (3) by 
- the resultatlve aspect (a clear difference 
between A. and D. and between E. and H., on 
the other hand a great similarity between 
A. and E. and between D. and H.), 
- the  pre f ixes ,  fo rming  three  types  ( " f rom" ,  
"over"  and " to"  except  be - ,  ve t - ,  o .o ) .  
In  German ex is ts  a r i ch  system of  p re f txu  
der ivat ives  in  th i s  group,  the i r  deta i led  
examination confirmes the distinctions 
proposed here. Verbs like Gbernehme~ (tak~ 
over) or ~bcrgeben, Gberreichen (ban 
ove___~r) belong to both from-to-cases A. and 
D. or E. and H., respectively? 
The remaining eight cases (upper index of 
CAUSE is 2) represent the passive voice of 
A. - H. a~d some other verbs, e. g. 
H~ bekommen, erhalten (receiv_~e) 
(15) Die Kinder bekamen (yon Hans) Spielzeug0 
The distribution (x)y(z) (under 5.) turns 
into (x)y z (under (7.). For these verbs the 
passive voice is impossible? 
Just the basic verbs nehmen and eb~ (and 
some more, e. g. fibergeben) do not meet the 
scheme in every detail: They may occupy sev~ 
eral positions of show a different distri- 
bution or optional ao~ants. It goes without 
s~ylng that for many of the considered verbs 
the expression (I) has to be specified, i. eo 
HAVE is too general. Moreover stealln~ is 
against the law, presentlng is connected 
with some benefit of z etc . . . .  
The classification of this verb group is 
in keeping with Schumacher (1986), p. 72d fro 
Other groups of verbs (e. g. "Informing"~ 
mitteile~, oo., e rfahren) have been dealt 
with the same way. Pairs of the type ~o fill 
the bottle with wate~r and to fill water i~o  
the bottle Field another confirmation of 
this formal approach.
