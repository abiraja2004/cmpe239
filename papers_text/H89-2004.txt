1 Can We Predict  Intonat ion? 
It is generally acknowledged today that, while the intonational features speakers 
select when they utter a sentence are not determined by the syntax, semantics 
or discourse context of that sentence, knowledge of these factors can help to con- 
strain the possible intonational features peakers are likely to choose. So, while 
intonational variation poses a challenge to speech recognition i  one sense - in 
presenting yet another indicator of over-all utterance meaning to be recognized 
- regularities noted between intonational features and the syntax, semantics and 
discourse features of an utterance also present rich possibilities for help in the 
recognition task. 
The many-to-many mapping between intonational features and syntactic and 
discourse features can be illustrated by considering the various ways of uttering 
the sentences in (1). 1 
(1) a. 560 CAN KIRK GET TO KODIAK BY MONDAY 
b. Kirk can get to Kodiak by Monday. 
For example, a senior officer might choose a falling pitch contour over (la) to 
convey an indirect request hat Kirk reach Kodiak by Monday. A less senior 
speaker, however, might produce (la) with rising (yes-no question) intonation, 
conveying merely a request for information. Alternatively, the syntactically 
related but distinct form of (la), (lb), might be produced with rising intonation 
to convey the same request for information, or with falling intonation to convey 
the information thus requested. So, different contours can be used over the same

database.

sentence to convey different meanings, and the same contour may be used over 
sentences differing only in syntactic structure to convey a similar meaning. 
Despite such possibilities for variation, research in intonational meaning and 
more practical application of such research in speech synthesis indicates that 
there are  regularities that recognition systems may be able to utilize. For ex- 
ample, knowledge of likely relationships between syntax and intonation tell us 
that, when (lb) is uttered in natural speech, it will be more likely to be said 
with falling intonation than with rising. And given that we know the speaker of 
(la) and have some rough idea of that speaker's authority, we can also predict 
whether that speaker will be likely to use rising intonation or not, based on 
whether that speaker will be likely to be trying to convey an indirect request or 
simply to gain information. So, knowledge of the structure of an utterance and 
knowledge of the overall context in which it is uttered help to constrain the set 
of intonational possibilities. Thus, intonational features uch as contour type 
provide indirect evidence as to what the syntactic structure of the associated 
sentence might be, given that we know the likelihood that a sentence like (la) 
might be uttered to convey an indirect request rather than a request for infor- 
mation. That is, in the general case, given that we know the likely utterer of 
(la) to be a clerk, we will expect (la) to be uttered as a request for information, 
and, thus with rising intonation. 
2 Can We Use Intonat ional  Information to Aid 
Speech Recognit ion? 
Interest in using higher-level intonational information such as pitch contour, 
intonational phrasing, and pitch accent placement to aid speech recognition has 
been intermittent.\[Lea79, Pie83, Wai88\] Progress in this area has been hindered 
by a) the difficulty of extracting higher level intonational characteristics auto- 
matically with any reliability; b) the lack of representations of the features to 
be extracted such that information can be incorporated into the recognition 
process; and c) an imperfect understanding of the particular constraints syntax, 
semantics and discourse features impose on a speaker's choice of intonational 
features. Thus, practical problems of feature detection have gone hand in hand 
with more theoretical issues of representation a d interpretation. However, 
there has been some progress in developing algorithms to extract and identify 
at least partial information about higher-level intonational features, uch as dif- 
ferentiation of stressed and unstressed syllables and distinction of rising from 
falling contours. 
At this stage, it does seem likely, that particular recognition tasks and par- 
ticular domains will find some higher-level intonational cues more useful than 
others. For testing the utility of predicting the syntactic 'type' of an utterance 
from its intonational contour, for example, domains in which there are broad 
23 
classes of utterances which can be reliably partitioned according to both into- 
national and syntactic ategory appear promising. Database query tasks, for 
example, where there is a reasonable balance between inverted yes-no questions 2,
which are commonly uttered with final rising intonation, and wh-questions 3, or 
imperatives 4, which are both commonly uttered with final fall - -  and in which 
there is relatively little likelihood of speech act ambiguity, seem well-suited 
to such an experiment. The DARPA Resource Management (RM) task thus 
seemed a good place to look for such distinctions. 
In domains uch as this, we might expect that distinguishing likely yes-no 
questions from other sentences might be a useful augmentation for traditional 
recognition methodologies, acting as a filter on matches proposed by the rec- 
ognizer or even providing an initial state in a regular grammar partitioned by 
broad syntactic 'type'. 5 The utility of adding such information is supported 
by certain classes of recognition errors, such as those illustrated in (2). 6 These 
errors represent instances in which the ability to distinguish yes-no questions 
intonationally from wh-questions, imperatives, and other sentence 'types' typ- 
ically uttered with falling intonation might serve as an aid to recognition (In 
each case, the (a) sentences represents the test sentence and the (b) sentence 
represents the recognizer's hypothesis.): 
(2) a. REF: IS kennedy+s arrival hour in pearl harbor AFTER ** fifteen 
hundred hours 
HYP: GIVE kennedy+s arrival hour in pearl harbor HAVE TO fif- 
teen hundred hours 
b. REF: WHAT IS the total fuel aboard THE mars 
HYP: WAS ** the total fuel aboard *** mars 
c. REF: IS shasta within six kilometers of thirteen north forty east 
HYP: THE shasta within six kilometers of thirteen orth forty east 
d. REF: WHEN+LL enterprise next be in home PORT 
HYP: WILL enterprise next be in home PORTS 
e. REF: *** FIND speeds available for england and fox 
HYP: ARE THE speeds available for england and fox 
That is, the test sentence represents a sentence type likely to be uttered with an 
intonational contour which would distinguish it from the sentence incorrectly 
2Sentences in which aux- or copula-inversion has occurred, such as 'IS MARS+S LAST  
LA T IN NORTH ATLANTIC  OCEAN ' where the copula is has been inverted (cf. 'Mars's 
last lat is in North Atlantic Ocean.'. 
3Questions beginning with who, what, when, where or how. 
4Such as 'D ISPLAY METEOR4-S LON USING OVERLAY BOX '. 
SThat is, inverted yes-no questions might be separated from other syntactic onstructions 
in the grammar. 
6These were some of the errors made on the DARPA February89 training set by one of the 
Bell Labs recognizers.\[Lee89, LRPW89\]

hypothesized by the recognizer. Among these errors, distinguishing between 
'when'll' and 'will' and between 'what is' and 'was' would appear to be partic- 
ularly difficult tasks for a recognizer on acoustic grounds. In fact, about 8% of 
sentence rrors made in this test were due at least in part to one of these two 
confusions. Table 1 shows all sentence errors in the test run in which yes-no ques- 
tions were confused with wh-questions, imperatives, or declarative sentences. 7 
(Column 2 shows the category of the actual utterance; column 3 show the cat- 
egory of the utterance recognized (yes-no question (ynq),wh-question (whq) or 
imperative (imp)); and column 4 show the lexical items confused.)

rising intonation and other utterance types with falling intonation - -  15 of the 
misrecognized utterances in fact were spoken with the 'likely' contour for their 
syntactic type. That is, in fifteen cases a yes-no question uttered with rising 
intonation was misrecognized as a syntactic type (wh-question or imperative) 
which would have been unlikely to have been uttered with rising intonation - 
or a non-yes-no question uttered with falling intonation was misrecognized asa 
yes-no question. 
However, while these errors might thus have been filtered by this simple 
association between contour and sentence type, it is not at all clear how well 
this solution might generalize ven to other sentences within the same domain. 
While yes-no questions are typically uttered with rising intonation in natural 
speech - -  and wh-questions and imperatives commonly uttered with utterance- 
final fall, it is not clear whether such distinctions appear with the same likelihood 
in sentences read in isolation, the data which most recognizers train and test 
upon. To investigate the possibility then of predicting structural distinctions 
from intonational ones, it is useful to examine the prosody of the training and 
test data itself. 
3 Are Yes-No Questions Intonational ly Distin- 
guished in the RM Database? 
To assess the potential for using contour to distinguish inverted yes-no questions 
from other constructions in current recognition tasks, I sampled inverted yes- 
no questions and wh-questions from the training and test data of the speaker 
independent RM database.\[PFBP88\] Of the 2810 sentence types in the RM 
Table 2: Sentence Types and Tokens in the RM Database

Total Questions ~ 1694 (60%) 
Total YNQs ~ 670 (24%)

\[\[ Sample

database, approximately 60% can be classed either as inverted yes-no questions 
(24%) or wh-questions (36%). I sampled 100 utterances of yes-no questions 
(from 50 types) and 100 utterances of wh-questions (from 53 types) to deter- 
26 
mine whether sentences were uttered with rising intonation or not.S The yes-no 
questions chosen were inverted copula questions in the present tense of the form 
' I s  .... '; no alternative questions were included in the sample, since these tend 
to be uttered with falling intonation. Both sample yes-no questions and sample 
wh-questions were selected from among the sentences in the database f wer than 
9 words in length, to minimize the likelihood of multiple intonational phrases 
in the utterance or of performance error in the production of the utterance. 
Of the 100 yes-no questions ampled from the RM database, only 55 were 
uttered with final rise. Only 9 of the wh-questions were similarly uttered, with 
the majority uttered with falling or level pitch. While the latter results seem 
consistent with previous observation about he tendency of wh-questions tofall, 
the findings for yes-no questions seem far too low. 
Table 3: RM Sample

WH-Q 91 9 100 
To test the representativeness of the contours in the sample, I examined 
samples of 50 inverted yes-no questions and 50 wh-questions from the TIMIT 
database (All were of distinct ypes.). 9 The results, presented in Table 4 appear 
much more consistent with observations of questions asked in natural speech. 
Thus, while only 55% of yes-no questions in the RM database were uttered 
Table 4:TIMIT1 Sample

with rising intonation, over 80% of yes-no questions in the TIMIT1 sample rose. 
Production of wh-questions appears imilar in both databases, with only 8% of 
the TIMIT1 wh-questions and 9% of the RM wk-questions uttered with final 
rise. 
8Note that this distinction oversimplifies the distinctions observed in natural speech be- 
tween question-rise and question-rise, but the results of this simple analysis did not warrant 
more refinement. 
9TIMIT has a much lower proportion of questions than the RM database, with only 142 
questions among TIMITI 's 1726 sentence types, some of them not syntactic yes-no questions 
or wh-questions. These were not considered in the sample. 
27 
The question then arises: why are yes-no questions produced so differently 
in the RMsentences than in the TIMIT1 sentences? Several explanations come 
to mind. First, one might hypothesize that certain yes-no questions would be 
more likely than others to be uttered with falling intonation, depending upon 
their semantic ontent. Those that might be interpreted as indirect requests, 
for example, like (la), might tend to be uttered with falling intonation, as noted 
above. If the RM sentences were ambiguous with respect o speech act, then 
readers might favor falling intonation with such sentences. Unfortunately, the 
contours in Figure 1 illustrate a not-uncommon finding in the sample of yes-no 
questions elected from the RM database - a pair of utterances of the same 
yes-no question, one uttered with a rising contour and the other with a falling 
contour; 19 other pairs reflect this dichotomy. The commonality of varying 
contours over the same sentence type together with the fact that I avoided yes- 
no questions with seeming potential for speech act ambiguity in this domain 
makes this explanation unlikely. 
A similar alternation is evident among the (many fewer) wh-questions uttered 
with rising intonation, which are illustrated by f0 contours from the same two 
speakers from Figure 1. For the wh-questions, it appears likely that speaker 
variability might account for the rising contours, since 6 of the 9 rising wh- 
questions were produced by a single speaker. However, a similar account does 
not appear possible for the 45 falling yes-no questions; no single speaker was 
responsible for more than 3. 
Another explanation for the results of Table 3 is suggested by the sort of 
contour illustrated in Figure 3. The lack of variation in pitch prominence and 
range shown in these f0 contours eems to be not atypical of much of the RM 
database - -  and appears to reflect a lack of engagement in the subjects, an 
absence of any attempt o reflect sentence 'meaning' in their productions, and 
- -  in the type of disfluencies that mark much of the data - -  some difficulty in 
performing the task. In short, the data do not appear to have been produced 
so as to maximize their reflection of the higher-level intonational characteristics 
of natural speech. 
So far the discussion of contour variation in the RM database has focussed 
on the disparity between subject performance in these sentences and observa- 
tions from natural speech. Nonetheless, even with data not intended to provide 
material for detecting and using contour variation, the possibilities for using 
such intonational cues are still substantially supported. The difference between 
subject tendency to use rising intonation with wh-questions and with yes-no 
questions, like the difference in propensity to use non-rising intonation with 
yes-no questions and wh-questions, is in fact still quite significant, l? And, while 
yes-no questions in the RM database are only uttered with rising intonation 55% 
of the time, note that approximately 86% of utterances with rising intonation in 
1?For example, a simple X 2 test of the data in Table 3 is significant at the .001 level (The 
X 2 statistic is 48.6 with df=l.)

the sample are indeed yes-no questions. And utterances characterized byfalling 
intonation are fully twice as likely to be wh-questions as yes-no questions, ac- 
cording to our sample. So, even though we might expect a contour distinction 
to be even more successful in recognizing data from, say, TIMIT1, even the 
apparently much less 'natural' data of the RM sentences provides a good case 
for the idea that sentence classes might indeed be distinguished by the contour 
with which they are uttered. 
4 Conclus ion 
While the RMsentences thus appear less than ideal in providing data for explor- 
ing the notion that distinguishing among general classes of pitch contour can be 
useful in distinguishing among structural classes of sentence for speech recog- 
niz ers, this database nonetheless provides evidence that even subjects reading 
sentences in isolation will approximate some of the distinctions made in real 
speech. As one example, the association between contour type and sentence 
type appears ignificant enough to permit overall contour type to serve as a fil- 
ter for recognition - at least for rising contours. That is, a rising contour should 
be a fairly reliable indicator of a yes-no question. 
Nonetheless, it is also clear that this association should be providing even 
better discriminatory power than it does in this database. If future data collec- 
tion efforts are to support more sophisticated uses of higher-level intonational 
information in the aid of speech recognition, then the standard ata-collection 
paradigm of sentences read in isolation must certainly be abandoned. Just as 
recognizing connected speech poses different problems from isolated word recog- 
nition, recognizing real, interactive speech poses different problems from recog- 
nizing isolated sentences. In natural speech, speakers use intonation to convey 
the meaning of a sentence and to convey relationships between that meaning and 
the meanings of other sentences. But speakers will not use prosody to convey 
meaning unless they understand the meaning to be conveyed. And speakers will 
not use prosody to convey relationships among sentences in a discourse if they 
are not generating larger pieces of text. So long as recognition systems are tested 
merely on isolated sentences, ofcourse, the difference between training and test 
data will be less important. But systems that are expected to supported even 
minimally longer dialogues will suffer, since intonational contours, phrasing, 
and stress assignment in interactive speech will vary significantly from isolated 
sentence data. In sum, training data and test data should mimic as much as 
possible the speech recognizers hope to recognize if both the problems presented 
by intonational variability and the possiblities presented by intonational regu- 
larities are to be adequately explored.
