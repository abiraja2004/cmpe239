This paper presents an algorithm capable of identifying the translation for each word in a bilingual 
corpus. Previously proposed methods rely heavily on word-based statistics. Under a word-based 
approach, frequent words with a consistent translation can be aligned at a high rate of precision. 
However, words that are less frequent or exhibit diverse translations generally do not have sta- 
tistically significant evidence for confident alignment, hereby leading to incomplete or incorrect 
alignments. The algorithm proposed herein attempts to broaden coverage by exploiting lexico- 
graphic resources. To this end, we draw on the two classification systems of words in Longman 
Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) and Tongyici Cilin (Synonym Forest, CILIN). Au- 
tomatically acquired class-based alignment rules are used to compensate for what is lacking in a 
bilingual dictionary such as the English-Chinese version of the Longman Dictionary of Contem- 
porary English (LecDOCE). In addition, this alignment method is implemented using LecDOCE 
examples and their translations for training and testing, while further examples from a technical 
manual in both English and Chinese are used for an open test. Quantitative r sults of the closed 
and open tests are also summarized. 
1. Introduction 
Brown, Cocke, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Jelinek, Laffert~ Mercer, and Roosin (1990) 
advocate a statistical pproach to machine translation (MT) and initiate much of the 
recent interest in bilingual corpora. Statistical machine translation (SMT) can be un- 
derstood as a word-by-word model consisting of two submodels: a language model 
for generating a source text segment S and a translation model for mapping S to its 
translation T. They recommend using a bilingual corpus to train the parameters of
translation probability, Pr(S I T) in the translation model. For MT and other pur- 
poses, many methods have been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, 
an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai, and Mer- 
cer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Sirnard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993; Gale 
and Church 1993), and for other language pairs, including English-German, English- 
Chinese, and English-Japanese (Kay and ROscheisen 1993; Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, 
Helfman, and Satish 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu 1994). Alignment at other 
levels of resolution is obviously useful. A section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, col- 
location, or word can be aligned to its translation (Kupiec 1993; Smadja, McKeown, 
and Hatzivassiloglou 1996). Other logical approaches involve aligning parse trees of 
a sentence and its translation (Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Meyers, Yan- 
garber, and Grishman 1996), or simultaneously generating parse trees and alignment 
arrangements (Wu 1995).

In addition to machine translation, many applications for aligned corpora have 
been suggested, including machine-aided translation (Shemtov 1993), translation as- 
sessment and critiquing tools (Isabelle 1992; des Tombe and Armstrong-Warwick 1993; 
Macklovitch 1994), text generation (Smadja 1992; Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivas- 
siloglou 1996), bilingual exicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Church and 
Gale 1991; Daille, Gaussier, and Lange 1994; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993; Li 1994; 
Wu and Xia 1994), and word-sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; 
Chang, Chen, Sheng, and Ker 1996). For these applications, we must go one step fur- 
ther from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process 
of word alignment, he translation of each source word is identified. This study con- 
centrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence 
and its translation. 
In the context of SMT, Brown et al (1993) present aseries of five models of Pr(S I T) 
for word alignment. Model 1 assumes that Pr(S \] T) depends only on lexical transla- 
tion probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates 
into the jth word t in T. The pair of words (s, t), or more precisely (s, t, i,j) since there 
could be more than one instance of s or t, is called a connection. Model 2 enhances 
Model I by considering the dependence of Pr(S I T) on the distortion probability (DP) 
d(i I J, l, m) where I and m are the respective l ngths of S and T measured in number of 
words. Brown et al (1990) propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization 
(EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters for LTP and DP from a bilingual corpus. 
The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both 
functions converge. In the expectation phase, the parameters t(s I t) and d(i I J, l, m) in 
the SMT model for all possible values of s, t, i, j, I, and m are estimated from the sample 
of an aligned bilingual corpus. In the maximization phase, each sentence-translation 
pair in the corpus is aligned by maximizing the translation probability, Pr(S I T). They 
examine the feasibility of aligning the English-French Hansards corpus using the SMT 
model, on both the sentence l vel and the word level. The SMT model is then tested 
for the task of machine translation. The model produces 35 acceptable translations for 
73 sentences. However, to our knowledge, the degree of success of word alignment 
has not yet been explored. 
Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) observe that reliably distinguishing sentence 
boundaries for a noisy bilingual text scanned by an OCR device is quite difficult. In 
such a circumstance, they recommend aligning words directly without he preprocess- 
ing phase of sentence alignment. Under that proposal, a rough character-by-character 
alignment is first performed. Based on the character alignment, words are subsequently 
aligned based on a modified version of Brown et al's Model 2. The authors report 
that 60.5% of 65,000 words in a noisy document are correctly aligned. For 84% of the 
words, the offset from correct alignment is at most 3. 
Gale and Church (1991b) present an alternative algorithm that does not estimate 
and store probabilities for all word pairs to reduce memory requirement and to ensure 
robustness ofprobability estimation. Instead, for each source word s, only a handful of 
target words strongly associated with s are found and stored. Such a task is achieved 
by applying a X2-1ike statistic. They report that the method produces highly precise 
(95%) alignment for 61% of the words in the 800 sentences tested. 
This paper is motivated by the following observations: First, the above survey 
dearly reveals that word-based methods offer only limited coverage ven after they 
are trained with an extremely large bilingual corpus. Second, we believe that for most 
applications, low coverage is just as serious as low precision. For aligned corpora to 
be useful for NLP tasks such as machine translation and word-sense disambiguation, 
a coverage rate higher than 60% is desirable, even at the expense of a slightly lower 
precision rate.

This paper presents a word alignment algorithm based on classification i existing 
thesauri. The proposed algorithm, called ClassAlign, relies on an automatic procedure 
to acquire class-based alignment rules; it does not employ word-by-word translation 
probabilities, nor does it use an iterative EM algorithm for estimating such proba- 
bilities. Experimental results indicate that classification based on existing thesauri is 
highly effective in broadening coverage while maintaining a high precision rate. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we briefly discuss the 
nature of text and translation that justifies a class-based approach. A set of three al- 
gorithms leading to class-based alignment are outlined in Section 3. The algorithms' 
effectiveness i  demonstrated through examples and their translations in the LecDOCE 
(Longman Group 1992), a bilingual version of the Longman Dictionary of Contempo- 
rary English (LDOCE, Proctor 1988), as well as sentences from bilingual texts in the 
LightShip User's Guide (Pilot Software Inc. 1993; Galaxy Software Services 1994). The 
experiments we undertook to assess the performance of these algorithms are the topic 
of Section 4. Quantitative experimental results are also summarized. In Section 5, we 
analyze the experimental results and consider ways in which the proposed algorithms 
might be extended and improved. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6. 
2. Text and Translation as a Class-to-Class Mapping 
The discussion in Section 1 indicates the limitations of statistical methods. As an 
alternative, we examine the feasibility of using an everyday bilingual dictionary in 
machine-readable form for word alignment. With tens of thousands of headword-and- 
translation pairs that can be used to propose high-precision connections, a bilingual 
machine-readable dictionary (MRD) surprisingly leads to even lower coverage than a 
statistically-derived l xicon. Below, observations are made to account for the reason 
why a substantial portion of translations deviate from what is listed in the bilingual 
MRD or what is statistically probable. Such deviations inhibit word-based methods ' 
from achieving broad coverage. We contend that a word's translational deviation is 
mostly bounded within the relevant semantic lasses, thus justifying a class-based 
approach to word alignment. 
2.1 Diverse In-Context Translations 
Given that the translations for a headword (dictionary translations, DTs for short) can 
be extracted from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE, a word in S can be aligned 
at a high precision rate with its DTs found in T. Headword-and-translation pairs are 
a reliable knowledge source for word alignment. However, they cover only a small 
part of the connections in an average sentence and its translation. Our experiments 
reveal that the translations ofa word in context (in-context translations, ICTs for short) 
are frequently more diversified than the offerings in an everyday bilingual dictionary. 
More specifically, less than 30% of the English words in the context of LecDOCE 
examples translate into one of the relevant DTs in the same dictionary. 
Translations in an everyday dictionary are meant o provide the reader with the 
idea of what is implied by the headword out of context; they are frequently more of 
an explanation than a translation. For instance, one LecDOCE sense entry defines the 
word boy as 'infml esp. AmE a male person, of any age, from a given place' and gives 
~Z~,) , .  (modi lai zhi nanren) as the translation relevant o this particular sense. 
Such a 'translation' per se seems unlikely to appear as the ICT of boy. Aside from this 
fundamental difference, behind the disparity between DT and ICT are a plethora of 
factors. These include (1) a failure on the dictionary's (or the statistically derived lexi- 
con's) part to cover a needed word sense, (2) mismatches in sense specificity between 
315 
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 
the two languages, (3) collocation pattern, and (4) frequent use of interchangeable syn- 
onymous translation ot covered in the dictionary. These factors are the reasons why 
many translations are statistically unlikely, thereby leading to a low coverage rate for 
word-based methods. 
Sense Gaps. Dictionary and statistically derived translations might not cover the word 
sense appropriate to a given word in context. This is particularly true when using an 
everyday dictionary for aligning bilingual technical manuals. For instance, the Lec- 
DOCE lists four senses and relevant translations for the word click, including (1) ~ 
~ ~ { ~  'to make a slight and short sound', (2 ) /~ 'to succeed', (3) { ,~ 
~ 'to fall into place', (4) ~ ,K~,~ 'to be a quick success, esp. with members of 
the opposite sex', none of which is the right sense for ~ 'to press', the translation of 
click in the context of (El): 
(El) Click anywhere lse on the screen background or press ESC. 
(C1) ~ i~ l~f l J~ : l~ i '~__ - -F \ ]~ ESCo 
Mismatch in Sense Specificity. Dictionary treatment of word senses in the source lan- 
guage might not correspond to the level of specificity for the relevant concepts in the 
target language. For instance, the LecDOCE differentiates two word senses for the 
word news by the means in which it is reported: whether it is via electronic (radio or 
television) or non-electronic (newspaper) media. In Chinese, the relevant concept is 
also differentiated according to how it is reported; however, the difference is between 
mass media (translated as ~r~)  and personal communication (translated as ~,~,). 
The following examples (E2, C2) and (E3, C3) demonstrate his particular instance of 
mismatch in sense specificity. 
(E2) to listen to the 7 o'clock news broadcast. 
(C2) ~ t ~ t i ~ ~ o  
(E3) Our latest news of our son was a letter a month ago. 
(C3) ~ J  ~-~ ~ ~i i~ l .~  ~ f~I-- ~ ~J ~/0~J ~ ~l~ o 
Collocation Pattern. The collocation pattern often forces the choice of an ICT quite dif- 
ferent from the DTs. For instance, the LecDOCE lists ~r~ 'news' and ~ r ~  'news 
reportage' as the translations for news. However, the translation for news modified 
by bad is usually ~j0~, 'message'. Similarly, lady modified by old almost surely trans- 
lates into 5~ 'wife' rather than the DTs, ~ 'lady' or ~;~f'~ 'woman' given in the 
LecDOCE. The following examples provide further details. 
(E4) Nothing but bad news in the newspaper today. 
(C4) @3~.~_L~ ~ 0g, o

Interchangeable Synonymous Translation. Disparity might arise simply because an in- 
terchangeable synonym of a DT is used. For instance, for the following LecDOCE 
examples, the synonyms ~| ,  ~g,  and ,~oF,~ are present in the translations, instead 
of the respective DTs, ~| ,  ~ J ,  and ,~,~. If these ICTs in (C7, C8, C9) are replaced 
by the DTs, the subsequent translations (C7 ~, C8', C9') remain correct.

A statistically-derived l xicon generally fares better than MRDs in covering such syn- 
onymous translations. However, this is limited to synonyms that appear as an alter- 
native translation frequently and consistently in a bilingual corpus. 
Bounding the ICTs. An ICT may deviate from the relevant DTs for a variety of reasons, 
but the deviation is not without constraints. Table 1 lists some examples of deviating 
translations taken from the LecDOCE. Examples include the words news, meet, lady, 
grief, care, and child and their respective translations ~j,~,, ~ j~,  ~,  ,~ ,  ~,  
and q~.  Notice that most in-context and dictionary translations of source words 
are bounded within the same category in a typical thesaurus uch as the LLOCE 
(McArthur 1992) and CILIN (Mei et al 1993). For instance, Da19-class words in CILIN 
(news and messages), ~J~,~,, ~r~,  ~ appear as the translations (DTs and ICTs) for 
Ge194-words in LLOCE (information and news) such as news and report. Similarl3~ 
Idl8-class words (hitting, touching, meeting, and missing), ~ ,  ~ J ,  ~ ,  Mi~ 
appear as the translations for McO72-words (meeting people and things) such as meet 
and encounter. This finding suggests that LTP can be estimated more robustly via class- 
to-class mapping. Furthermore, such ICTs and DTs are often synonymous compounds

number of high-precision connections. Experimental results indicate that a DT-based 
method connects over 40% of words in LecDOCE examples with their ICTs using this 
rudimentary method. Table 2 presents ome examples from the experiments, indicating 
the connections that are attributed to a complete or partial match using headword-and- 
DT pairs extracted from the LecDOCE. For instance, partial match enables the method 
to pair up only and F~ according to its DT J~ ' .  These connections can be subsequ6ntly 
used as the basis for generalizing to a class-based alignment rule in the form of (X, Y), 
which stipulate the connection between an X-class word and a Y-class word. 
2.2 Class-based Word Alignment 
To ensure broad coverage, the class-based approach seems to be a promising alter- 
native to word-based methods. Classes can be formed from words in more than one 
way. Automatic statistical methods for derived classes (Brown, Della Pietra, deSouza, 
Lai, and Mercer 1992) are not appropriate, since they also suffer low coverage due to 
data sparseness. Classes formed from morphologically related words are easy to de- 
rive and apply. Morphological classes can be formed, either from words that start with 
the same five-character p efix as in Gale and Church (1991b), or rigorous analysis as 
suggested in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Lafferty, and Mercer (1992). Although 
easily applicable, morphological classes are not particularly effective in broadening 
coverage of word alignment. Chang and Chen (1994) also examine the feasibility of 
using part-of-speech lasses. A potential alternative involves adopting categories avail- 
able in machine-readable lexicographic resources such as Roget's thesaurus (Chapman 
1977) or hand-crafted computer lexicons (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, and Miller 
1990; McRoy 1992). 
3. Algorithms Leading to Class-based Word Alignment 
This section describes a series of three algorithms leading to a class-based system 
for word alignment. The first algorithm attempts to obtain reliable connections. The 
second algorithm generalizes the connections into a list of class-based rules, which 
stipulate that a pair of classes of words in the source and target languages are likely 
mutual translations. The third algorithm performs the actual word alignment based 
on the acquired rules, in addition to DTs. 
319 
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 
3.1 Dictionary-based Word Alignment 
This section describes a rudimentary word-alignment algorithm, DictAlign, based on 
the DTs from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE. Consider a text and translation 
pair (S, T), a word s in S, and its ICT, t in T. Let DTs denote the set of translations 
listed in the LecDOCE for the headword s. Recall that if for a word t in T, there is a dt 
in DTs such that t matches dt completely or partially, then, t is likely to be the ICT of 
s. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, DictAlign computes the set WT = {t \] t is a 
word in T} and calculates the similarity between each t and the DTs relevant o S. A 
similarity measure based on the unweighted Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) can be given 
as follows: 
2 x Id n tl (1) 
Sim(d, t) - id \[ + it I 
where d, t 
Idl 
Itl 
la n tl 
= Mandarin morpheme strings, 
= the number of the morphemes in d, 
= the number of the morphemes in t, 
= the number of the morphemes in the intersection of d and t. 
Based on this similarity measure, the likelihood of a connection can be associated with 
the following formulation that links the likelihood of a connection to similarity with 
a DT: 
DTSim(s, t) = max Sire(d, t) (2) 
dEDTs 
For instance, consider the following sentence and its Mandarin translation, focusing 
on the word encounter: 
S = He encountered many difficulties. 
T = 
We will have the following: 
Ws = {he, encounter, many, difficulty} 
wT = 2 ,  iil, Iil , } 
DTencounter = {~,  ~11~, ~ }. 
Therefore, the connections relevant o encounter with nonzero DTSim values based on 
unweighted Dice coefficient are as follows: 
DTSim( encounter, ~ ) 
DTSim( encounter, ~\ ]  ) 
= max{S im(~,  ~),Sim(itl l~, ~),Sim(~tl~, ~)}  
2x l  0 2x l~ 
= max 1+2,1_T_2, i_T_~j=0.67 
= max{S im(~,  ~t \ ]  ),Sim(i~t~, ~f \ ] ) ,S im(~,  ~! \ ]  )} 
{2x l  0 2x1~ 
= max 2+2'2+2'2+2j=0"5  
The head morpheme in a word is usually more relevant in determining a word's 
meaning, just as content words carry more meaning than function words. Matching 
such a morpheme often implies a higher likelihood of finding the ICT. For instance, 
is the head morpheme of the DT ~I \ ] ,  and should be given a heavier weight. Our 
320 
Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment 
experiments indicate that by weighting morphemes, ICT ambiguity can be resolved 
more successfull3a Assuming that such weights can be obtained in a manner similar 
to what is done in IR when assigning weights to index terms, the weighted Dice 
coefficient can be used by substituting weights for counts in equation (1) to arrive at 
the following: 
2 x \[d A t\[ (3) 
Sim(d,t) - jd l+ it\] 
where d, t 
lal 
itl 
lantl 
= the Mandarin morpheme strings, 
= total weights for the morphemes in d, 
= total weights for the morphemes in t, 
= total weights for the morphemes in the intersection of d and t. 
The above descriptions are summarized as the DictAlign Algorithm: 
Algorithm 1 (DictAlign) Align each word s in S with the ICT t in T based on DTs. 
Step 1: Remove all stop words in S to obtain a list of keywords, Ws. 
Step 2: Lookup all possible words WT of T in a dictionary. 
Step 3: For each s in Ws, look up the root of s in a bilingual dictionary to obtain DTs. 
Step 4: For all d E DTs and all t E WT, calculate Sire(d, t) according to equation (3). 
Step 5: For each (s, t) E Ws x WT, calculate DTSim(s, t) according to equation (2). 
Step 6: For each word s, produce a connection (s, t), if DTSim(s, t) is maximized over 
t E WT and DTSim(s, t) > hi where hi is a preset hreshold. 
Step 7: Compile the list of Connections and denote the list as CONN. 
To illustrate how DictAlign works, consider the sentence pair (El0, C10). After the 
stopwords are removed, we obtain Ws = {old, lady, clad,fur, coat}. The list of words 
in T is also obtained by consulting a Chinese dictionary. 2 Subsequently, for each s in 
Ws, we lookup s in the LecDOCE to obtain DTs. Table 3 shows dictionary translations 
relevant o (El0). Table 4 lists all Ws words along with the relevant DTs, possible 
translation t, as well as the values of Sim(d, t) and DTSim(s, t). Table 5 displays the 
result CONN for various values of threshold hi. 
(El0) The old lady was clad in a fur coat.

3.2 Acquisition of Mutually Translatable Class Pairs 
ClassAlign is conceived to capture the diversity of translations for broad-coverage 
alignment. One way to do so is via the classification of words in thesauri. More 
specifically, one can generalize from a connection (s, t) to a class-to-class mapping 
(X, Y) where X and Y are thesaurus classes containing s and t respectively. However, 
this simple intuition is complicated by the fact that a word might belong to more 
than one class, that is, if the classification is based on a thesaurus that allows for 
word-sense ambiguity. For a word in a particular context, if one considers classes that 
are not intended for the context, noise can be introduced. For instance, consider the

connection (have, ?Z) found in the context of Example (Ell, Cll). According to the 
LLOCE, have belongs to the following topical sets: Cb024 (relating to sex), De081 (hav- 
ing and owning), EaO03 (eating and drinking), Li273 (auxiliary related to time), and 
Nil59 (making necessary). The LLOCE class EaO03 and CILIN class Fc06 (to eat, chew, 
suck, and drink) are intended for this context. However, without hat information, the 
following noisy rules might be introduced: (Cb024, Fc06), (De081, Fc06), (Li273, Fc06), 
(Nf/59, Fc06), along with the signal (EaO03, Fc06).

The noise is usually distributed randomly while the signal tends to repeat itself. 
Nevertheless, connections (s, t) related to some ambiguous words s or t may cause 
noise to accumulate, leading to erroneous generalization. Therefore, one should try to 
throw away such noise. Moreover, any signal that gets thrown away by not considering 
(s, t) is often filled by a connection (s', t) where s' is a synonym of s. For instance, get is 
many ways ambiguous, as indicated in diversified ICTs in the LecDOCE examples in 
Table 6. However, each of these ICTs seems to form a connection with a less-ambiguous 
synonym of get such as receive, reach, and understand in LecDOCE examples. Table 6 
provides further details. 
As is typical in IR research, highly frequent and ambiguous words (known as 
stopwords in the IR literature) can be thrown out to reduce such noise. A list of 
stopwords used in the experiments includes the following: 
a, at, be, drive, eye, field, fix, for, from, function, get, go, have, head, idea, in, into, 
lot, of, on, place, the, to, up, with . . . .  3

With the difficulties of finding appropriate classification systems and suppress- 
ing noise now resolved, the question remains: How can class-to-class mapping be 
acquired? Just as with the derivation of a bilingual lexicon from a corpus, acquisition 
of such mapping requires a statistical measure. The Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) is a 
similarity measure that gauges the ratio of the members in one collection being iden- 
tical to those of another collection. Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou (1996) 
propose to link co-occurrence to the Dice coefficient in their study of bilingual collo- 
cations. They observe that, unlike statistical measures related to mutual  information, 
the Dice coefficient is insensitive to sample size and, thus, more effective for acquiring 
bilingual collocations from a bilingual corpus. Our experimental results confirm their 
observation. Under a formulation linking translation to conceptual similarity, the Dice 
coefficient is a very useful estimator of the class-to-class mapping. 
Therefore, in this work, we measure the likelihood of class-to-class translation 
mapping in terms of the ratio of member pairs that are connections observed in a 
bilingual corpus. This ratio can be easily measured using the Dice coefficient as follows: 
From(a, Y) + ~ To(X, b) 
ClassSim(X, Y) = acx bEY 
IX\[ + \]Y\] 
(4) 
where IXI = the total number of the words in X, 
IYI = the total number of the words in Y, 
From(a,Y) = 1, if (3y E Y)(a,y) E ALLCONN, 
= 0, otherwise, 
treated as such because of their high frequency in the LDOCE and their involvement indiverse LLOCE 
topics and CILIN categories. For instance, the LLOCE lists eye under the following topical sets: Ac051 
(part of an animal), Aj151 (part of a plant), Bc023 (part of human body), Dg152 (part of a shoe), Hd126 
(part of a needle), etc.

To(X, b) = 1, if (3x E X)(x, b) E ALLCONN, 
= 0, otherwise, 
ALLCONN = the word-translation pairs compiled from the results of running 
DictAlign on all sentence-translation pairs of a bilingual corpus. 
This naive estimator works efficiently for classes of compatible sizes. Occasion- 
ally, for extremely small or large classes, the coefficient does not accurately reflect 
how likely words in one class are to translate to words in another class. To remedy 
this problem, we explore the feasibility of weighting the member words. According 
to our result, weighting eradicates most instances of the problem caused by uneven 
classification. The weight assigned to each word should positively correlate to the 
frequency of the word so it reflects the expected ratio of word-translation pairs. As- 
suming that such weights can be obtained on the basis of each word's frequency in 
a bilingual corpus, weights can substitute for counts in equation (4) to arrive at the 
weighted version of the Dice coefficient shown below: 
~ From(a, Y)+ y~To(X,b) 
ClassSim(X, Y) = a~x bEY 
IXI + IYI (5) 
where IXI = the total weights of the words in X, 
IYI = the total weights of the words in Y, 
From (a,Y) = the weight of a, if (3y E Y)(a,y) E ALLCONN, 
= 0, otherwise, 
To(X,b) -- the weight of b, if (3x E X)(x,b) E ALLCONN, 
= 0, otherwise,

translations in the training corpus using Algorithm 1.

Table 7 presents a random sample of class-based rules acquired from connections 
found in LecDOCE examples and translations.

Step 1: Run DictAlign on the sentences in a bilingual corpus to obtain a list of initial

Step 2: For all X E CX and all Y E CY, compute similarity ClassSim(X, Y) based on

tion of words in the source and target languages, respectively. 
Step 3: Produce an alignment rule (X, Y),

The main step in ClassRule is illustrated through the calculation of the ClassSim 
value between LLOCE topical set CaO05 (kinds of woman) and CILIN category Ab01 
(man and woman, ~\].h., ~ ,  ~) .  For simplicity, the unweighted value of Class- 
Sim(CaO05, Ab01) is calculated. CaO05 and Ab01 contain 11 and 92 words, respectively. 
In ALLCONN, six words in CaO05, i.e. dame, female, girl, lady, Madam, and miss, trans- 
late into words listed under AbO1. In the other direction, seven words listed under 
Ab01, i.e. !~J~, !~, !~,  ~-~,  ~,  t J~ ,  and 5~.h., are the translations from words 
listed under CaO05. Thus, the ClassSim value between CaO05 and Ab01 can be valued 
at (7 + 6)/(11 + 92) = 0.13. Figure 1 presents further details. 
3.3 Class-based Word Alignment 
The proposed alignment algorithm ClassAlign is based on the following observations: 
First, dictionary translations can be used to produce high-precision connections. Thus, 
DictAlign should be employed to produce initial connections whose translations ex- 
hibit a high similarity to a DT. That is, a relatively high threshold, 0.7 should be used. 
Second, the class-based rules acquired through the ClassRule Algorithm should cap- 
ture the diversity of translations to a large extent. According to the observations in
Section 2, the rules should stipulate most of the connections left out in the DictAlign 
step. Nevertheless, conflicting connections do occasionally arise. Such conflicts can be 
resolved according to an additional consideration of distortion mentioned in Section I 
Estimating the Likelihood of a Connection Candidate. The above observations can be stated 
formally from the perspective of Brown et al's (1993) Model 2. As mentioned earlier, 
the model stipulates that a connection be given a probability value Pr(s, t), the product 
of lexical translation probability t(s I t) and distortion probability, d(i I j, 1, m). Also 
according to the model, we give each connection candidate a probabilistic value based 
on lexical and positional considerations: 
Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i,j) (6) 
We argue, however, that it is difficult to robustly estimate t(s, t) and d(i,j) for all the 
values of s, t, i, and j. Therefore, the two functions are defined and estimated by a 
limited number of cases, according to lexical, conceptual, and positional conditions. 
327 
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 
For this purpose, we define conceptual similarity between s and t as follows: 
ConceptSim(s, t) = max ClassSim(X, Y) (7) 
sE X, tE Y 
Lexical and conceptual conditions are set up based on DTSim and ConceptSim, while 
positional conditions are set up based on dislocation, a distortion measure relative to 
both left and right context. 
Estimation of LTP Based on Lexical and Conceptual Conditions. The LTP t(s, t) is defined by 
the following cases: 
Case 1. 
Case 2. 
Case 3. 
Case 4. 
Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical and conceptual similarit)5 
i.e., ConceptSim (s, t) ~ hi and DTSim(s, t) > h2. 
Connection (s, t) exhibits high conceptual similarity, i.e., 
ConceptSim (s, t) _> hi and DTSim(s, t) < h2. 
Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical similarity, i.e., 
ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DTSim(s, t) _> h2. 
Otherwise, ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DTSim(s, t) < h2. 
The connections satisfying each condition are given the same probability value 
determined by maximal likelihood estimation (MLE). For instance, if there are k true 
connections in a sample of n candidates (s, t) such that ConceptSim(s, t) > hi and 
DTSim(s, t) > h2, then all these candidates are given the same MLE value for LTP, i.e., 
t(s, t) = tl = k/n. Equation (8) sums up the above discussion: 
t(s,t) = { 
tl if ConceptSim (s, t) _> hi and DtSim(s, t) _> h2, 
t2 if ConceptSim (s, t) > hi and DtSim(s, t) < h2, 
t3 if ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DtSim(s, t) ~ h2, 
t4 if ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DtSim(s, t) < h2. 
(8) 
Estimation of Distortion Probability (DP). In a similar fashion, we formulate the distor- 
tion function by cases related to the monotonicity of translational position with respect 
to context. Such a formulation is inspired by Gale and Church's (1991b) treatment of 
distortion. In their study, the authors replace the distortion probability with a proba- 
bility function defined by different values of slope, a measure of the position of t with 
respect o the left context of s. This measure is generally quite accurate, leading to 
a distribution function concentrating at slope 1. Nevertheless, room for improvement 
still exists, as can be illustrated using the concept of a binary inversion transduction 
tree (ITT) proposed by Wu (1995). The ITT is a shared parse tree depicting the struc- 
tural difference between a sentence S and its translation T. Figure 2 presents the ITT 
of (E12, C12). The horizontal bar denotes that the noun phrase such a lazy mortal and 
the prepositional phrase as you are inverted when translated into Mandarin. The slope 
of the first word in such an inverted structure is typically quite large, making the dis- 
tribution of the slope function slightly fiat. If multiword structural inversion occurs, 
as it frequently does, then the slope of the first word according to the right context is 
still very small.

ITT of the example-translation pair (E12, C12). 
For instance, the first word as in the inverted structure as you has a high slope value 
with respect o its left context such a lazy mortal. However, since the words as and you 
translate into the fifth and sixth words in (C12), the word as has a slope value of 1 
with respect o its right context, you. 
We believe that by considering the translational position relative to both the left 
and right contexts, one obtains a distribution function with a smaller deviation, thereby 
making a tighter estimation possible for d(i,j). To this end, we define dislocation, dis, 
for the connection (s, t) of the ith and jth words in S and T to denote I(J - j ' )  - (i - i')\[, 
where i' is the position of a word s' sharing the minimum syntactic structure with 
s, and s' translates into t', the j 'th word in T. Short of syntactic analysis, dis(i,j) can 
be calculated with respect o a nearby connection in CONN, the initial connections 
established by DictAlign. Such treatment closely approximates the dislocation value. 
In light of this, dislocation can be defined as follows: 
dis(i,j) = ( \[j - j ' \ [  if 3(j')(i,j') E CONN, 
min(\[dL\[, \[dR\[) otherwise, (9) 
where i = the sequence number of s in S,

Dislocation values for the example-translation pair (E12, C12). Each connection candidate in 
(E12, C12) is represented as a cell. The connections in CONN are shown as a bold face 0. Each 
of these zero dislocation values extends vertically, incrementing by one for each upward or 
downward move, resulting in a shaded vertical bar of dislocation values. All other 
connections take their dislocation values from the minimum diagonal projection of the related 
cell on the two bounding bars. For instance, the projections of the connection (such, ~_~ ) 
(shaded in figure) on the left and right bounding bars (/-connections and lazy-connections) are 
2 and 1, respectively. Therefore, the dislocation value is 1, the minimum of 2 and 1. 
CONN>i = {(k, I) I kth and Ith word  in (S, T) form a connect ion in CONN, k > i}, 
CONN = the initial connections establ ished according to DT. 
The distort ion funct ion def ined by cases can now be given according to dislocation 
values. 
{ dl if dis(i, j) = 0, 
d(i, j) = d2 if dis(i, j) 1, (10) 
d3 if dis(i,j) 2, 
d4 if dis(i,j) > 3. 
The connect ion candidates with small  dislocation values tend to be true connec- 
tions. For instance, 8 out of 15 zero-dislocation connections for (E12, C12) are correct, 
whi le only 1 out of 20 candidates with a dislocation of 1 is a true connection. All 
candidates wi th  dislocation values greater than 1 are false. Figure 3 provides further 
details. Again, all connections atisfying a certain case in equat ion (10) are given the 
same MLE value. For instance, if there are k true connections in a sample of n can- 
didates (i,j) with 0 dislocation, then all of these candidates are given the same MLE 
value for DP, i.e., d(i, j) = dl = k/n for all i and j such that dis(i,j) = 0. 
By using a small  sample of 200 sentences from the LecDOCE, the LTP and DP

Algorithm 3. (ClassAlign) Class-based word alignment for a pair of sentences (S, T). 
Step 1: Tag each word in S with POS information and convert each word to the 
root form to obtain the set Ws of words in S. 
Step 2: Initialize the result ANS to an empty list. Run DictAlign on (S, T) to obtain 
a list of initial connections, CONN. 
Step 3: Look up the dictionary to obtain the set WT of possible words in T. 
Step 4: For each connection candidate (s, t) E Ws x WT, compute Pr(s, t) according 
to equations (6) through (10). 
Step 5: Add to ANS the connection (s*,t*) that maximizes Pr(s,t) over all 
s, t E Ws x Ww with a value greater than h3. 5 Remove all conflicting 
candidates involving s* and t* from subsequent consideration. This step 
repeats itself until the candidates run out or every remaining candidate 
(s, t) is associated with a Pr(s, t) value lower than h 3. 
Step 6: Output ANS as the final result of word alignment.

the WT words and their relevant CILIN categories. Table 13 presents the dislocation 
values for all connection candidates in Ws x WT. The cells with a boldface 0 in Table 13 
represent the initial connections in CONN and two dummy connections placed at the 
beginning and end of both sentences. Table 14 lists the connection candidates with 
higher Pr(s, t) values. 
After executing Step 5, ClassAlign selects the candidates, (lady, ~,k.) ,  6 (fur, ~. 
), both with Pr(s, t) value of 0.392, in terms at Step 6. These connections are added 
to ANS and the conflicting candidates uch as (old, ~i~),  (old, ~, \ ]k ) ,  (old, ~A,),  
(lady, ~),  (lady, Jk), (in, gl,), (coat, gF.), (fur, ~l~), etc. are removed. In the subsequent 
iterations, connections (coat, ~)  (Pr(s, t) = 0.208), (old, ~)  (Pr(s, t) = 0.080), (clad, ~)  
(Pr(s, t) = 0.080), and (The, ~)7 (Pr(s, t) = 0.005), are selected. ClassAlign stops after 
running out of connections with a probabilistic value greater than h3, 0.005. Table 15 
summarizes the connections chosen to form the solution. The success rate is evaluated

according to how many English words are correctly aligned. 8 Evaluation is based on 
100% coverage, i.e., each word in the English sentence is checked for correct alignment. 
A word not given a connection is considered a failure if it should be connected to a 
Mandarin word; otherwise it is considered a success. For this example, all nine words 
are aligned correctly. Therefore, the success rate is 9/9 = 100%. 
4. Experiments with ClassAlign 
To assess the proposed method's effectiveness, we have implemented the algorithms 
described in Section 3 and conducted a series of experiments. Tests are performed on 
the sentences found in the LecDOCE and a user's manual available in both languages 
to assess the method's robustness and generality. The similarities and differences be- 
tween English and Mandarin texts are briefly reviewed, since our experiments involve 
the alignment of English-Mandarin parallel corpora. A general description of the ma- 
terials used in the experiments follows. Finally, the success rates are quantitatively 
evaluated. 
4.1 Contrastive Analysis of English and Mandarin Chinese 
Language typology is the study of similarities and differences between languages, 
formalized in terms of parameters such as word order and morphological structure. 
Li and Thompson (1981) examine Mandarin Chinese according to four typological 
parameters that reveal the basic structure of Mandarin Chinese as compared to those 
of other languages, English in particular. These four parameters are the morphological 
structure of words, the number of syllables per word, topic prominence, and word 
order. Li and Thompson's typological description of Mandarin is described below, 
from the perspective of the task of word alignment. 
8 A small percentage of connections (7.8%) in our evaluation are incomplete ones and are considered to
be correct. Melamed (1996) takes the same stance in his study of deriving a probabilistic lexicon. He 
observes that even incomplete entries are useful for many applications and there are ways of expanding 
incomplete morphemes orwords in a connection, sothat they become complete (Smadja 1992).

Morphological Structure of Words. The most striking feature of Mandarin as compared to 
English is the relative simplicity of word structure. That is, most Mandarin words are 
comprised of a single morpheme rather than a stem morpheme and a suffix serving 
grammatical functions uch as case (as in Turkish and Japanese), number, agreement, or
tense (as in many other languages including English). Mandarin verbs do have aspect 
morphemes, including -j" (-le, perfective), ~ (-guo, experienced action) and ,~(-zhe, 
durative). Other grammatical functions are either non-existent or expressed through 
an additional function word. In contrast o this lack of inflectional morphological 
complexity, Mandarin is relatively rich in other types of morphological combinations, 
including compounding. 
These morphological differences result in a difference in the number of words in 
an English sentence and its Mandarin translation. In terms of alignment, this word- 
number difference means that mult iword connections must be considered, a task which 
334 
Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment 
is beyond the reach of methods proposed in recent alignment works based on Brown 
et al's (1993) Model 1 and 2. 
Basic Orientation of the Sentence: Topic vs. Subject. Another feature distinguishing Man- 
darin from other languages i topic prominence. In addition to the grammatical rela- 
tion of subject, a description of Mandarin must include the topic element, which can 
be characterized asfollows: First, a topic always comes first in the sentence and is op- 
tionally followed by a pause in speech. Second, a topic is the old information of which 
both the speaker and listener have some knowledge. Third, what distinguishes a topic 
from a subject is that the subject must always have a direct syntactic and semantic 
relation with the verb, but the topic does not need to. For instance, in the sentence 
(E13, C13), the first word ~ (daxiang, 'elephant') is the topic and the second word 
~ (bizi, 'nose') is the subject; ~ 'elephant' is the focus of the discourse, but it is 
the subject ~ 'nose' that is very long; not ~ 'elephant'. 
(E13) The elephant has a very long nose. 
(C13) ~ ~:~ ql~ ~o 
Daxiang bizi hen chang 
Elephant nose very long 
The topic prominence of Mandarin sentences represents alignment connections 
with a large distortion in position, leading to difficulty in estimating the likelihood of 
a connection according to translational position. 
Word Order. Greenberg (1963) stated that the world's languages fall into three word 
order groups according to the order of the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) in a 
simple transitive sentence. A language, in general, belongs to one of three basic word 
order types, SVO, SOV, and VSO. By this notion, English is an SVO language in which 
the verb typically follows the subject and precedes the object. For most languages, 
other aspects of word order, such as that of modifier and modified elements, correlate 
with the order of V and O. However, Mandarin is not an easy language to classify 
according to this typology for a number of reasons. First, the notion of subject is not 
well-defined. Second, unlike in English, word order in Mandarin is not determined 
solely on grammatical grounds but rather depends on semantics. For instance, whether 
an adverbial expression appears in pre- or postverbal position depends on subtle 
semantic differences. More specificall~ a time phrase in preverbal position tends to 
denote punctual time, while that in postverbal position signals durative time, as in: 
(E14) I have a meeting at three o'clock. 
(C14) ~J~ -~ ~d~ ~\]~o 
I three o'clock have-a-meeting 
(E15) I slept for three hours. 
(C15) ~  T ---~ ~i~o 
I sleep ASPECT three o'clock 
(C15') ~ ~ ~!  t~ m To 
I three o'clock sleep ASPECT 
In contrast, both kinds of time phrase appear in postverbal position in English. As a 
result of facts such as these, many linguists contend that Mandarin is a language in 
transition from SVO to SOV. Further details can be found in Li and Thompson (1981). 
335 
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 
Similar to the situation created for topic prominent sentences, the SOV features 
of Mandarin represent a deviation from the SVO order of English. Such a deviation 
further worsens our ability to estimate the likelihood of a connection according to 
translational position. 
4.2 The Experimental Setup 
The experimental results obtained from the proposed algorithm with respect o word 
alignment are presented in this section. Nearly 42,000 example sentences and their 
translations from the LecDOCE were used as training data, primarily to acquire rules 
and to determine MLE estimates for the cases of LTP and DP. The algorithm's per- 
formance was evaluated using the two sets of data. The closed test set consists of 
200 examples and their Mandarin translations randomly selected from the LecDOCE. 
The English examples range from 8 to 23 words long; average xample length is 11.5 
words. There are, on average, 1.56 inversions per example-translation pair. The open 
test set consists of 200 sentences randomly drawn from the English and Chinese ver- 
sions of the LightShip User's Guide. The English sentences in this test set range from 
4 to 34 words long; average sentence length is 11.8 words. There are, on average, 1.60 
inversions per sentence pair. Table 16 provides some examples from the LightShip 
User's Guides. 
The two thesauri, LLOCE and CILIN, are used as the classification systems of 
source and target words. The LLOCE contains 23,769 entries and CILIN contains 63,754 
entries. Both thesauri cover just over 90% of the words in the test sets. 
4.3 Evaluation 
The first three experiments were designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
naive DictAlign algorithm based on a bilingual MRD. According to the experimental 
results, although DictAlign produces high-precision alignment, the coverage for both 
test sets is below 30%. However, if the thesaurus effect is exploited, the coverage can 
be increased considerably, atthe cost of a decrease of less than 4% in precision. Table 17 
provides further details. 
In the fourth experiment, he ClassAlign algorithm is employed to align both sets 
of test data again. Table 18 reveals that the acquired conceptual information compen- 
sates for what is lacking in the LecDOCE to yield optimum alignment results. The 
ClassAlign algorithm expands coverage almost twofold to over 80%, while maintain- 
ing the same level of precision. The generality of the approach is evident from the 
open test's comparably high coverage and precision rates. As shown in Table 18, over 
80% of the source words in both test sets are connected to a target and over 90% of 
the connections are true ones. 
5. Discussion 
This section thoroughly analyzes the alignment results from the experiments described 
in Section 4 and, in particular, the data relating to cases where the algorithms failed. 
Analytical results demonstrate he strengths and limitations of the methods and sug- 
gest possible improvements o the algorithms. 
5.1 Compounding in Mandarin 
As stated earlier, the compounding effect in Mandarin frequently results in a change 
in the number of words between an English sentence and its Mandarin translation. 
The correct alignment decision for a Mandarin compound frequently involves more 
than one English word. ClassAlign often fails under such circumstances. For instance,

(E16) She is a star with the theatre company. 
(C16) ~1~ I~l I~ i~,,~ i! o 
Other methods for aligning English and Mandarin texts in the literature also fall 
prey to the problem of Mandarin compounds. For instance, the following partially 
correct connections complicated by compounding are reported in a recent study on 
alignment of Hong Kong Basic Law (Fung and McKeown 1994). 
(E17) monoxide 
(C17) - -~q~ ('carbon monoxide') 
(E18) Basic 
(C18) : ~  ('Basic Law') 
(E19) second 
(C19) - '~  ('second reading') 
Because it is not limited to the connections involved in a presegmented target sen- 
tence (Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu and Xai 1994), ClassAlign avoids most instances of 
these errors. In addition, with elaborate preprocessing such as parsing, phrase group- 
ing, and collocation analysis (Smadja 1992), the problem of word-number difference 
338

can be averted by performing alignment at various levels: parse tree (Matsumoto, 
Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman 1996), phrase (Kupiec 
1993), and collocation (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996). 
5.2 Funct ion Words,  Co l locat ion ,  and Free Translat ion 
Language-Specific Function Words. The morphological differences between English and 
Mandarin give rise to many language-specific function words. Such Mandarin function 
words are often quite ambiguous in part of speech as well as in word sense, leading to 
numerous alignment errors. For instance, ClassAlign connects the words for and of in 
(E20) erroneously to the morphemes T and ~ in (C20), respectively. Table 19 presents 
further details. 
(E20) He abdicated all responsibility for the care of the child. 
(C20) ~ ~ iF ~, @-~,\], ~x ~- -  ty-J ~ ~ o 
Collocation. As mentioned in the previous section, collocation is one of the reasons 
why in-context translation usually deviates from the dictionary translation. However, 
unlike other deviations, bilingual collocation is not easily bounded within a couple 
of classes. For instance, the translation for take (Mb051, carrying, taking and bring) in 
the collocation take effect is usually ~ ('see') (Fc04, seeing and looking), as in example 
(E21, C21). However, there is insufficient evidence to support a class-to-class mapping 
from Mb051 to Fc04. In any case, deriving the MbO51-to-Fc04 mapping would be an 
overgeneralization. 
(E21) How soon does the medicine take effect? 
(C21) :~  3K~_ ~ ? 
Paraphrased and Free Translations. For various reasons, such as language typology, style, 
and cultural differences, a translator does not always translate literally on a word- 
by-word basis. Adding and deleting words is commonplace, sometimes resulting in a 
paraphrased or free translation. Such translations obviously create problems for word 
alignment. For instance, in example (E24, C24), only one word, I, is translated literally, 
into ~.  The main verb angle in example (E25) is given a paraphrased translation 
~g~ ('to change the angle'). The noun phrase the people she is speaking to in (E25) 
is paraphrased as ~ 'audience.' A significant amount of free translation arises due 
to the use of four-morpheme Mandarin idioms for stylistic reasons. For instance, the 
clause as long as I breathe in (E22) translates into an idiom ~'al~.%Zde~ and the sentence 
339 
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 
(E23) translates into , , k ,~) .  Such free or paraphrased translations are beyond the 
reach of the proposed method. 
(E22) I shall love you as long as I breathe!

(C25) ~ g ~ ~ ~ @ ,  J ; ~ ~ o  
5.3 Class-based versus Word-based Models 
ClassAlign achieves a degree of generality in the sense that a true connection can 
be identified, even when it occurs only rarel}~ or not at all, in the training corpus. 
This kind of generality is unattainable with statistically trained word-based models. 
Moreover, class-based models offer the advantages of a smaller storage requirement 
and higher system efficiency. Unfortunately, they have the disadvantage of erroneous 
overgeneralization from word-specific onnections. For instance, due to the acquired 
mapping from Gg273 (element of sound in language) to Bg07 (sound, tone, etc.), the 
verb accent in (E26) is connected erroneously to ~\ [~ ('syllable') in (C26). 
(E26) The accent in the word "important" is on the second syllable. 
(C26) Important ~.~-~-~i~3~?~?~\[~.~ o 
Nevertheless, our experiment has shown that the advantages outweigh the disadvan- 
tages, at least for this particular formulation of a class-based approach to alignment. 
6. Concluding Remarks 
In this paper, we have presented an algorithm capable of identifying words and their 
in-context ranslations in a bilingual corpus. The algorithm is effective for specific 
linguistic reasons. First, a significant majority of words have diversified translations 
that are not found in a bilingual dictionary or statistically-derived l xicon but that are 
largely bounded within the word classes in thesauri. Therefore, we contend that a more 
successful alignment can be achieved using a class-based approach. Our assumption 
seems to hold, for the experiments in this study demonstrate hat the method provides 
broad-coverage alignment with almost no loss in precision. 
In a broader sense, we have shown that thesauri and corpora can be used in 
combination to address the critical issues of generality and efficiency. The thesaurus 
provides classification that can be used to generalize the empirical knowledge gleaned 
340 
Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment 
from a corpus. The corpus provides training and testing materials, thereby allowing 
knowledge to be derived and evaluated objectively. 
The algorithm's performance could definitely be improved by enhancing the var- 
ious modules of the algorithms, e.g., morphological analyses, bilingual dictionar~ 
monolingual thesauri, and rule acquisition. Nevertheless, this work presents a func- 
tional core for processing bilingual corpora at lexical and conceptual levels. 
While this paper has specifically addressed English-Chinese corpora, the linguistic 
issues motivating the algorithms eem to be quite general and are, to a large extent, 
language independent, which means that the algorithm presented here should be 
adaptable to other language pairs. The prospects for English-Japanese or Chinese- 
Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising.
