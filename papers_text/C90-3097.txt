Parallel ing recent shifts within 
Grammatical Theory away from rule-based and 
toward principle-based systems, there has arisen 
widespread interest in the possibility of similar 
refocusing with respect to natural language 
processing (cf. Abney (1988), Berwick & 
Weinberg (1984), Clark (1987), Fong (1990), 
Gibson (1987), Johnson (1988), Kashket (1988), 
Pritchett (1987, 1988, 1990, in press, 
forthcoming), Stabler (1989), among others). 
Fundamental to principle-based as opposed to 
rule-based models of parsing is the hypothesis 
that the Parser itself adheres to a version of the 
Projection Principle which maintains that 
each level of syntactic representation is a 
projection of the lexical properties of heads. 
With respect o parsing, the PP implies that a 
node emmet be projected before the occurrence of
its head since the relevant features which 
determine its categorical identity and license its 
own and its arguments'  attachment are 
theretofore undetermined. This paper describes 
an ongoing project in the implementation f an 
object-oriented (Smalltalk-80 TM) Government and 
Binding parser which adheres to Ihe strong 
competence hypothesis that principles of 
Universal Grammar are emp!oyed irectly in 
parsing. Specifically, the parse operates by 
projecting phrasal structure as determined by the 
lexical properties of heads and licensing local 
attachments which maximally satisfy on-line 
principles of Universal Grammar at every point 
during a parse. Though this model was 
originally motivated with regard to its 
psychological plausibility, in this paper we 
tbcus primarily on issues of implementation (see 
Pritchett: op. cir. for a more detailed iscussion 
of the psycho!inguistic issues). 
In the implemented parser, the following 
new Ob ject  subclasses are defined: 
Object 
PrincipleBasedParser 
Lexicon 
LexicalItem 
Node 
EmptyNode 
FullNode 
DoubleBarNode 
SingleBarNode 
ZeroBarNode 
Chain 
LicensingRelation 
ThetaRoleAs signment 
CaseAssignment 
SpecHe adAgreement 
XPSe lection 
An instance of PrincipleBasedParser 
(henceforth simply the parse,') itself7 acts as the 
buffer for tree structures. The parse of a string 
succeeds if at the end of input, there is exactly 
one tree in the parser and all grammatical 
principles are satisfied for every Node in that 
tree. 
The syntactic structures actually created and 
manipulated by the parser are subinstances of the 
class Node. Nodes accord with a binary- 
branching version of X' Theory and each Node 
exists as an element of a maximal projection: 
\[xP \[vP \] \[x' \[X\] \[zP \]\]\]. Phrase Structure 
constraints on the linear order of Nodes is 
specified in the pool variable, HeadParameter; in 
this note we assume the English configuration. 
The speci f ier  and complement positions 
themselves are either fully specified maximal 
projections or instances of the special class 
EmptyNode. Nodes respond in the expected 
fashion to a range of messages concerning 
eonf igurat ional  structure, such as c -  
commands :, m-commands ::, governs:, 
mother, sister, etc. 
Each Node may be associated (coindexed) 
wittl other Nodes via an instance of the class 
cha in ,  a subclass of Sor ted  Co l lec t ion ,  
where Node ct precedes Node 13 in an instance 
of Cha in  iff a c-commands 13. Given this 
definition, two Nodes may cooccur within the 
same Cha in  only if they are contained in the 
same tree structure. Every Node has an 
associated Chain,  though in the default case a 
Node is the Cha in '  s singleton member. For 
a Node to be global ly licit, all relevant 
grammatical principles must be satisfied with 
respect to a its Chain.  
Subinstances of tt~e abstract class 
LicensingRelation represent he actual 
principles of Grammar which license Nodes, 
such as the 0-criterion and Case Theory. Each 
Node keeps track of all licensing relations in 
which it participates via the instance variables 
licenserRelations 
licenseeRelations. 
As an illustration of the model as discussed 
so far, consider how a simple sentence, 
Vampires were seen, is processed. 
This sentence is fed to the processor one PF- 
word at a time by the procedure: 
I parser  \] 
parser<- PrincipleBasedParser 
newEnglishParser ? 
parser newWord. 'vampires ' 
parser newWord: 'wex"e ' 
parser newWord: 'seen' 
%parser output 
First a parser with an English lexicon and 
English parameter  settings; (e.g. the 
1 437 
HeadParameter)  is created by sending 
PrincipleBasedParser the message 
newEng l i shParser .  Next, the string 
'vampires' is sent to the parser with the message 
newWord:, which operates as follows: 
newWord: aWord 
\[ lexical Item maximalProject ion I 
maximalPr o j e c tion<--I exicon 
project: aWord. 
self addLast: maximalProjection. 
self changed 
The lexicon is queried and returns a maximal 
project ion in response to the message 
project : ' vampires'. This maximal 
Projection: \[.xv \[e\] [~, \[y vampires\] \[e\]\]\] is added 
to the parser, where the e indicates instances of 
the class EmptyNode, which may ultimately 
be filled by or eoindexed with other Nodes. 
Next, and crucial to the on-line application of 
grammatical principles, the changed message 
is sent, indicating that the parser's contents have 
altered and signaling that the reapplication of 
grammatical principles is relevant. Whenever 
the parser eceives the message changed,  it is 
automatically sent the message update :  by 
the Smalltalk-80 TM system, which is defined as 
follows: 
update: dummy 
self attachLastTwoTrees. 
self expandLastTree. 
self bui ldChains InLastTree 
The most important message in this method is 
attachLastTwoTrees wherein the 0- 
criterion and Case Theory (among others) 
actively determine attachments. Furthermore, if 
any of the three messages ent by update  : 
itself makes changes to the parser's contents, it
too will in turn send changed messages to the 
parser, again tr iggering the sending of 
update  :. In tlais way, the parser manipulates 
its contents continually until a local steady state 
is reached with all grammatical principles 
maximally satisfied. Hence, this 
changed/update :  message sequence is 
fundamental to the parser's operation as it is in 
this fashion that grammatical principles are 
represented as on-line in the system. 
Returning to the example, none of the 
messages within update has any effect when the 
parser comains only the NP vmnpires, and the 
parser eaches a steady state with no licenser 
available and the NP unavoidably left locally 
role!ess. No higher structure, including IP, is 
projected as relevant heads have not been 
encounterS. 
Next, the word 'were' is sent to the parser, 
and its maximal projection, an I_P, added: \[yp \[e\] 
\[~, \[~ vampires\] tell\], tip \[e\] [i, \[i were \[e\]\]\]. As
a result, a changed message is sent, and the 
update  : message's method is executed. This 
time, the message attachLastTwoTrees 
will have an effect. This method examines the 
last two trees in the parser and attempts all 
possible attachments of one into positions in the 
other. The method then chooses the attachment 
which is licensed to the highest degree. An 
attachment is defined as licensed to degree nif by 
making the attachment, n different licensing 
relations will be newly discharged. (See 
Pritchett cited above for psycholinguistic 
justification of this selection procedure as well 
as some alternative approaches to the notion 
'maximal ly  l icensed' . )  Given adjacency 
requirements, two attachments are considered In
this example: the attachment of the IP into the 
complement ofNP and the attachment of the NP 
into the specifier of IE Only the second results 
in the discharge of a licensing relation, namely 
the case assigned by I under government. Hence, 
this attachment is chosen, so that the parser now 
contains only one element: \[Iv \[vampires\] it' \[~ 
were\] \[e\]\]\]. The requirements of Case Theory are 
satisfied to the maximum degree possible in the 
local string- both with respect o the target NP 
which requires these features and the head which 
must discharge them. 
Next the method expandLastTree  is 
sent. In this case, the method causes the IP to 
expand into a CE As a result, the contents of 
the parser becomes: \[cv \[e\] [c' \[c \] tip \[vampires\] 
it' \[i were\] tel\]I\]\]. The last message in the 
method for update :, 
bui ldChainsInLastTree is sent but has 
no effect. Since the first two messages sent in 
update  : caused changes to the contents of the 
parser, they both send changed messages, with 
the result that update  : is executed again. 
However,  none of the three messages in 
update  : has any effect this time around as 
there is a single tree in the parser, and a local 
steady state has been reached, with all structure 
licensed to the maximum degree possible with 
respect to UG principles. 
Finally, the word seen is sent to the parser. 
Seen is identified as a passive participle which, 
as a lexical property, assigns an internal 0-role 
but no Case. In the VP which is projected, the 
V acts as the licenser in a licensing relation, 
namely an instance of ThetaRoleAssignment 
under government. Again, since the parser's 
contents have changed, update  : is sent, 
invoking a t tachLastTwoTrees  forcingthe 
VP attachment asa complement of INt,L: \[cp tel 
\[c' \[c \] tip \[vampires\] it' \[t were\] \[\[vP \[e\] iv' \[v 
seen\] \[e\]\]\]\]\]\]\]. (This is carried out by means of 
an instance of XPSelection- a subclass of 
LicensingRelation relevant o functional heads.) 
The message xpandLastTree is sent but 
has no effect.  Next,  the message 
bu i ldCha ins InLastTree  is sent. The 
method associated with this message attempts to 
associate Nodes and EmptyNodes (through 
Cha in  building) in order to more fully satisfy 
Case Thee D' and the 0-criterion. In this example 
the empty complement of VP is added to the 
Cha in  associated with the NP vampires and the 
V's 0-role assigned to this empty position. As a 
438 2 
result, the Cha in  possesses both a 0-role and 
Case since its head (the NP) is in a Case 
position and its tail (the empty node) in 0- 
position. The contents of the parser are now: 
\[cP \[e\] [c' \[c \] \[iP \[NP vampires\]l \[l' \[I were\] \[\[ve 
\[e\] Iv' \[v seen\] \[e\]l\]\]\]\]\]\]. Inputterminates and 
the message output  is sent to the parser, 
which checks that all mandatory licensing 
relations have been fulfilled and returns the final 
structure. 
At this point, we will briefly discuss how 
the head-driven principle-based model here 
predicts certain psycholinguistic facts. This 
discussion will be schematic and the reader is 
refen'ed to Pritchett (op. cit.). Consider for 
example, well-known garden-path effects of the 
sort found in an example like, After John drank 
the water evaporated Informally, the problem 
for the human parser in such examples is that 
the post verbal NP is prematurely construed as 
the complement of the verb, which causes 
difficulty when it must be reinterpreted as a 
subject. In terms of our implementation, once 
the parser has been sent the words up through 
water, it contains the following tree: \[cP \[e\] \[c' 
\[c after\] ~1, \[NP John\] \[i' \[I el\] \[\[ve \[e\] Iv' \[v 
drank:t\] \[nr the water\]\]\]\]\]\]\]. Subsequently, the 
word evaporated is sent, and the projected VP 
added to the parser, however there is no licensing 
position into which it can attach. This remains 
true when the VP subsequently expands to IP 
and CP: \[CP \[e\] [C' \[C\] lIP \[e\] \[I' \[I e\] \[\[VP \[eli 
Iv' \[vevaporatedl\] \[e\]\]\]\]\]\]\]. The initial 
misanalysis of the NP the water results from the 
parser's premature construal of a global subject 
as a local object in order to satisfy Case and 0- 
theory, which results in global failure. The 
reason that reanalysis is not possible in 
instances of this sort is due to the hypothesis 
licensed positions are indelible and is discussed 
in detail in Pritehett (op. cit.). What is crucial 
is that a principle-based parser of this sort makes 
the initial parsing error as a result of its 
fundamental strategy to maximally satisfy 
grammatical principles locally at every point 
during the parse. 
The architecture of the parser also arguably 
provides a processing, as opposed to a 
grammatical, account of effects deriving from 
Huang's (1982) Constraint on Extraction 
Domains which prohibits movement from 
within posit ions which are not properly 
governed. For example, it proscribes examples 
such as, *Who i do pictures of e i bother John. 
To give just one example, according to our 
parsing-theoretic a count, extraction from within 
subjects is impossible since there is simply no 
local option of forming the requisite cha in  at 
the time the subject constituent is being parsed, 
given the fact that the parser is strictly head 
driven. Recall that a sentence (IP) is not 
projected until either an inflectional element or a 
verb possessing inflectional features is 
processed. Before a category is projected, it is 
impossible to license its specifier, the subject. 
Consequently, in the previous example, after the 
word of is processed, the parser contains the 
following two unintegrated Nodes: Ice \[NP 
who\] \[c' \[c do\] \[e\]\]\], and \[yp \[el \[s'\[s pictures\] 
\[pp \[p of\] \[e\]\]\]\]\]. These two Nodes cannot be 
locally integrated before the projection of IP and 
hence the requisite Cha in  cannot be formed 
between the wh-word in SPEC-CP into the NP 
pictures of as the two phrases are not locally 
constituents of the same parse tree. in other 
words, the NP is not locally a subject at that 
point during the parse but i,; rather unattached. 
See Pritchett (to appear) for details. Thus our 
implementation begins to provide an existence 
proof that a parser driven by the Projection 
Principle and the on.-line application of global 
grammatical principles is both psychologically 
and implementationally realistic.
