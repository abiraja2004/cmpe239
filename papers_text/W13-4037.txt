Abstract
Due to the mobile Internet revolution, peo-
ple tend to browse the Web while driv-
ing their car which puts the driver?s safety
at risk. Therefore, an intuitive and non-
distractive in-car speech interface to the
Web needs to be developed. Before de-
veloping a new speech dialog system in a
new domain developers have to examine
what the user?s preferred interaction style
is in order to use such a system. This pa-
per reports from a very recent driving sim-
ulation study and its preliminary results
which are conducted in order to compare
different speech dialog strategies. The
use of command-based and conversational
SDS prototypes while driving is evaluated
on usability and driving performance. Dif-
ferent GUIs are designed in order to sup-
port the respective dialog strategy the most
and to evaluate the effect of the GUI on us-
ability and driver distraction. The prelim-
inary results show that the conversational
speech dialog performs more efficient than
the command-based dialog. However, the
conversational dialog distracts more from
driving than the command-based. Further-
more, the results indicate that an SDS sup-
ported by a GUI is more efficient and bet-
ter accepted by the user than without GUI.
1 Introduction
The pervasive use of smartphones in daily situ-
ations impacts the automotive environment. In
order to stay ?always connected? people tend to
use their smartphone?s Internet functions manually
while driving. However, using a smartphone man-
ually while driving, distracts the driver and endan-
gers the driver?s safety. According to Governors
Highway Safety Association (2011) 25% of U.S.
car crashes are related to drivers using their cell-
phones while driving. Therefore, the development
of an intuitive and non-distractive in-car speech in-
terface to the Web is essential in order to increase
driver safety (Peissner et al, 2011).
Before developing a new speech dialog system
(SDS) in a new domain developers have to ex-
amine how users would interact with such a sys-
tem. An Internet user study by Hofmann et al
(2012a) in which the subjects had to solve Internet
tasks orally, revealed that concerning communica-
tional (e.g. sending an Email) and transactional
tasks (e.g. booking a hotel) conversational and
command-based speaking styles were used with
equal frequency. Because of the equal frequency
of occurrence you have to examine which speech
dialog strategy - the command-based or the con-
versational - is the most suitable for these tasks.
First studies on the evaluation of dialog strate-
gies have been conducted by Devillers and
Bonneau-Maynard (1998) who compare two SDS
allowing the user to retrieve touristic information.
One dialog strategy guides the user via system
suggestions, the other does not. The evaluated di-
alog strategies comprise the fundamental ideas the
command-based and conversational dialog strat-
egy consist of. By applying qualitative and quan-
titative criteria they conclude that user guidance is
suitable for novices and appreciated by all kinds
of users. However, there was no GUI involved
and the speech interaction was performed as pri-
mary task. Considering the driving use case other
results may be achieved since the primary task is
driving. Furthermore, the use of these SDS among
advanced users needs to be investigated.
In the TALK project, Mutschler et al (2007)
compared a command-based speech dialog to a
conversational dialog where the driver had to con-
trol the in-car mp3-player by speech while driving.
The same graphical user interface (GUI) was used
for both dialog strategies. Although the conver-
233
sational dialog was more efficient the command-
based dialog was more appreciated by the sub-
jects. According to Mutschler et al the high error
rate of the conversational strategy was the reason
for the higher acceptance of the command-based
dialog. There were no significant differences in
the driving performance revealed when using the
different SDS.
The speech recognizer quality has improved
enormously within the last five years. There-
fore, the weak speech recognition performance of
Mutschler et al?s conversational dialog may be
nowadays less significant. Furthermore, the use of
the same GUI for different dialog strategies could
have additionally influenced the result. The GUI
should be adapted to the particular dialog strategy
in order to benefit from the advantages of the re-
spective strategy the most and to allow for a com-
parison of optimal systems.
This paper reports from a very recent driving
simulation study and its preliminary results which
are conducted in order to compare different speech
dialog strategies. The use of command-based and
conversational SDS prototypes while driving is
evaluated on usability and driving performance.
The systems have been developed for German and
allows users to perform a hotel booking by speech.
Different GUIs are designed in order to support the
respective dialog strategy the most and to evaluate
the effect of the GUI on usability and driver dis-
traction. The experiments have been conducted
at DFKI, Saarbru?cken using the OpenDS1 driv-
ing simulation. The research work is performed
within the scope of the EU FP7 funding project
GetHomeSafe2.
The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: In Section 2, the developed SDS prototypes
are briefly described. Section 3 presents the ex-
perimental setup and its results and finally, con-
clusions are drawn.
2 SDS Prototype Concepts
The chosen use case for the design of the SDS
concepts is booking a hotel by speech while driv-
ing since it covers many different subdialog types
(parameter input, list presentation and browsing,
etc.). For this purpose, the online hotel booking
service HRS3 has been used as data provider for
1http://www.opends.eu/
2http://www.gethomesafe-fp7.eu
3http://www.hrs.com
the SDS.
Each SDS prototype concept offers the same
functionality: First, the user has to input his search
parameter to retrieve a list of hotels. The user
can browse the list and ask for detailed informa-
tion about a certain hotel. If the hotel matches his
needs he is able to book the hotel. In addition, the
user can change the search parameters.
In the following, the different speech dialog
strategies and the corresponding GUI designs are
briefly decribed. A detailed description of the
human-machine interface (HMI) concepts can be
found in Hofmann et al (2012b).
2.1 Speech Dialog Strategy Design
SDS Prototypes for German language have been
developed including the following SDS features:
In order to speak to the system the driver has to
press a Push-To-Activate (PTA) button. Further-
more, the driver is able to interrupt the system
while prompting the user (?barge-in?). When de-
signing the different dialog strategies we particu-
larly focused our attention on the dialog initiative,
the possibility to enter multiple input parameters
and the acoustic feedback.
2.1.1 Command-based Speech Dialog
Strategy
The dialog behavior of the command-based dialog
strategy corresponds to the voice-control which
can be found in current state-of-the-art in-car SDS.
By calling explicit speech commands the speech
dialog is initiated and the requested information is
delivered or the demanded task is executed. There
are several synonyms available for each command.
By using implicit feedback in the voice prompts
the driver is informed about what the system has
understood. After the first command the user is
guided by the system and executes the steps which
are suggested and displayed by the system. The
GUI supports the speech dialog by showing the
?speakable? commands as widgets on the screen
(see Section 2.2). A sample dialog is illustrated in
the following:
Driver: Book a hotel.
System: Where would you like to book a hotel?
Driver: In Berlin.
System: When do you want to arrive in Berlin?
Driver: Tomorrow.
System: How long would you like to stay in Berlin?
Driver: Until the day after tomorrow.
234
2.1.2 Conversational Speech Dialog Strategy
In the conversational dialog strategy the dialog ini-
tiative switches during the speech interaction. The
driver is able to speak whole sentences where mul-
tiple parameters can be set within one single ut-
terance. Thereby, the dialog can be more natural,
flexible and efficient. The driver is informed about
what the system has understood by using implicit
feedback. The GUI does not present the ?speak-
able? commands on the screen. In order to indi-
cate the possible functions icons are displayed (see
Section 2.2). A sample dialog is presented in the
the following:
Driver: I would like to book a hotel in Berlin.
System: When do you arrive in Berlin?
Driver: I?ll arrive tomorrow and leave
the day after tomorrow.
As illustrated in the example the driver can al-
ready indicate some input parameters when ad-
dressing the system for the first time. The system
verifies which input parameters are missing in or-
der to send a hotel request. The system prompts
the user and collects the missing information. Al-
though the system asks for only one parameter, the
user is able to give more or other information than
requested.
2.2 GUI Design
The different GUIs have been designed in order to
support the speech dialog strategies and to eval-
uate the effect of the GUI on usability and driv-
ing performance. The different GUIs have been
customized corresponding to the dialog strate-
gies only as much as necessary since an objec-
tive comparison is targeted. When designing the
screens we followed the international standard-
ized AAM-Guidelines (Driver Focus-Telematics
Working Group, 2002).
2.2.1 Command-based GUI Design
In the command-based dialog strategy the driver
uses commands to speak to the system. In order
to give the driver an understanding of the ?speak-
able? commands, the speech dialog is supported
by the GUI. For that reason the currently possible
speech commands are displayed on the screen at
all times which may lead to a high visual distrac-
tion. Hence, in automotive terms the command-
based speech dialog strategy is also called ?speak-
what-you-see? strategy.
Figure 1(a) illustrates the main screen of the ho-
tel booking application at the beginning of the ho-
tel booking dialog. Here, the first input parameter
?destination? (?Ziel? in German) is requested by
the system. Afterwards the user is guided step-by-
step by the system. When the driver has given the
requested information, a new widget appears on
the screen and the system asks the driver for the
corresponding input.
2.2.2 Conversational GUI Design
In the conversational dialog strategy the driver can
speak freely and does not have to use certain com-
mands. There is no need to give the driver a vi-
sual feedback of the currently ?speakable? com-
mands whereby the visual distraction may be low-
ered. For that reason, the content on the head unit
screen does not have to indicate the possible op-
tions to proceed with the speech dialog. The sub-
function line which was used to indicate the avail-
able commands is replaced by only few symbols
which resemble the current GUI state. Figure 1(b)
shows the form filling main screen at the begin-
ning of the speech interaction where the user is
already able to input several parameters at once.
2.2.3 Without GUI
We also investigated the need for a visual feed-
back, why the two speech dialog strategies are
also evaluated ?without GUI?. In this case, with-
out GUI means that no content information is dis-
played on the screen. However, a visual feedback
which indicates if the user is allowed to talk is
presented in the top bar of the screen (see Figure
1(c)).
3 Evaluation
3.1 Method
3.1.1 Participants
The experiment was conducted at DFKI,
Saarbru?cken. In total, 24 German participants
(mainly students) participated in the experiment.
All participants received a monetary expense
allowance and possessed a valid driver?s license.
Due to missing data recordings during the exper-
iment data of 1 participant had to be excluded
from the analyses. The remaining participants
comprised 9 male and 14 female subjects and the
average age was 26 years (standard deviation (SD)
= 4,1). 56,5% of the participants were driving
their car at least once a day. 56,5% had little to no
experience with speech-controlled devices.

3.1.2 Experimental Design
Four different HMI concept variants were evalu-
ated in a 2x2 (speech dialog strategy: command-
based vs. conversational, GUI: with vs. without)
design. The Command-based and Conversational
GUI were only used with the corresponding dialog
strategy. The 4 HMI concepts were the following:
? Command-based speech dialog (?Comm?)
? with GUI (?CommGUI?) and
? without GUI (?CommNoGUI?)
? Conversational speech dialog (?Conv?)
? with GUI (?ConvGUI?) and
? without GUI (?ConvNoGUI?)
Each participant encountered all four conditions
(?within-design?). For each condition, two tasks
had to be accomplished. We investigated the
participants speech dialog performance and in-
fluences on driving performance while using the
SDS.
3.1.3 Materials
Speech Dialog Prototypes: In the experiment,
the speech dialog prototypes described in Section
2 have been used. In order to explain the func-
tionality and the control of the SDS prototypes to
the user, instruction videos for each speech dia-
log strategy were presented. By presenting tutorial
videos, we ensured that each participant was given
identical instructions.
During the experiment, participants had to solve
several tasks: They had to book a certain hotel
according to given search parameters. The tasks
were verbalized as little stories which contained
the necessary parameters in a memorable manner.
A sample task in English is presented below:
Imagine, you and your colleague are on the way
to Cologne for a two-day meeting right now. You
need two single rooms for these two nights which
you have not booked, yet. Your appointment
takes place in the city center of Cologne, where
you would like to spend your night. Please look
for a matching hotel for those nights.
In total, participants had to perform 16 tasks. Four
tasks were used as sample tasks to familiarize par-
ticipants with the respective speech dialog strategy
after showing the instruction video. The remain-
ing eight tasks were used for the data collection.
Questionnaires: During the experiment differ-
ent questionnaires were used:
? Preliminary Interview: In a preliminary ques-
tionnaire we collected demographical infor-
mation (age, gender, etc.) about the partic-
ipants. Furthermore, we surveyed driving
habits, experience with speech-controlled de-
vices, and hotel booking habits.
? SASSI questionnaire (Hone and Graham,
2001): The SASSI questionnaire covering 6
dimensions consists of 34 questions and is
widely used to measure subjective usability
evaluation of SDS.
? DALI questionnaire (Pauzie, 2008): The
DALI questionnaire covers 6 dimensions in
order to evaluate the user?s cognitive load.
The applied questionnaire consisted of 7
questions covering each dimension and an
additional question addressing the manual
demand.
? Final Interview: This questionnaire was de-
signed to allow for a direct comparison of the
respective SDS prototypes at the end of the
experiment. Each participant had to rate the
different SDS on a scale from 1 - 10 regard-
ing several subjective measures. For each of
the six SASSI dimensions, one question was
asked. Additionally, we asked questions to
directly compare cognitive load and to get
information about the participants? personal
preference of interaction style with the sys-
tem at different sub dialogs.
Driving Simulation Setup: The experiment
was conducted in the driving simulator at DFKI?s
?future lab? (see Figure 2). The participants were
236
sitting on the driver?s seat in a car which was
placed in front of a canvas onto which the driving
simulation was projected. The participants con-
trolled the driving simulation by the car steering
wheel and pedals. During the experiment the ex-
aminer was sitting on the passenger seat.
Figure 2: DFKI Driving Simulator Setup.
Previous driving simulation studies employ the
standard Lane Change Test (LCT) by Mattes
(2003). However, this driving task does not con-
tinuously mentally demand the user and thus, does
not reflect the real cognitive load while driving.
Furthermore, LCT is based on single tracks which
limits the recordings to a certain time. We em-
ployed the ConTRe (Continuous Tracking and Re-
action) task as part of the OpenDS1 driving sim-
ulation software which complements the de-facto
standard LCT including higher sensitivity and a
more flexible driving task without restart interrup-
tions. The steering task for lateral control resem-
bles a continuous follow drive which will help to
receive more detailed results about the two diverse
dialog strategies. Furthermore, mental demand is
addressed explicitly by employing an additional
reaction task implemented as longitudinal control.
A detailed description of the ConTRe task can be
found in Mahr et al (2012).
In the experiment, after giving the participant
the hotel booking task instructions, the experi-
menter started the driving simulation. When the
participant has crossed the start sign in the simula-
tion he had to begin the speech dialog. When the
hotel booking was completed, the experimenter
stopped the driving simulation. Thereby, driving
performance was only recorded during the speech
dialog.
3.1.4 Procedure
In the experiment, 4 conditions were evaluated:
The conversational speech dialog (with and with-
out GUI) and the command-based speech dialog
(with and without GUI). We did not randomize
all four conditions, because the participants might
have been confused if the speech dialog styles vary
too often. Therefore, we decided to employ dialog
styles blockwise (see Figure 3). In one block, only
one speech dialog variant with the two GUI condi-
tions was tested. The order of the two blocks was
counterbalanced between participants to control
for learning and order effects. Thereby, half of the
participants were first introduced to the command-
based dialog, whereas the other half of the partic-
ipants started with the conversational dialog. Fur-
thermore, the order of GUI conditions within one
block was balanced between participants. In each
of the four conditions, the participants had to per-
form two tasks. The order of the tasks was the
same for all participants regardless of the system
condition. Hence, all tasks were encountered in
all dialog and GUI combinations. When the sec-
ond task was finished, participants had to fill out
the SASSI and the DALI questionnaire for each
condition.

The overall procedure of the experiment is il-
lustrated in Figure 4. At the beginning of the
experiment, participants had to fill out the pre-
liminary questionnaire. Afterwards they had the
possibility to get to know the driving simulation
in a test drive lasting at least 4 minutes. After
the test drive, the participants completed a 4 min-
utes baseline drive and had to fill out the DALI
questionnaire afterwards to assess driving perfor-
237
mance without secondary task. Next, the partic-
ipants were shown the video of their first speech
dialog variant and became familiar with the SDS
by performing the 4 explorative tasks. Subse-
quently, participants performed the first SDS con-
dition (SDS Type 1) both with and without GUI.
After testing SDS Type 1, SDS Type 2 was intro-
duced by presenting its instruction video and again
the explorative tasks were performed. Participants
performed the second SDS condition (SDS Type
2) also with and without GUI. Finally, participants
completed a second baseline drive and filled out
the final questionnaire.

3.1.5 Dependent Variables
In the experiment, we collected several types of
data to evaluate the speech dialog and the driv-
ing performance data. During speech interaction
the SDS produces log files, which contain the link
to the recorded audio file of the spoken user ut-
terance, the speech recognizer result, the inter-
pretation of the natural language understanding
(NLU) module, and the text-to-speech (TTS) out-
put. Based on the log file, the whole speech di-
alog can be reconstructed. The driving simula-
tion OpenDS also produces log files at runtime,
which contain the steering wheel deviation for lat-
eral control and the reaction times for longitudinal
control for each recorded time frame. During the
experiment, the examiner was observing the test
procedure in order to take notes on task success.
Based on the collected data, the measures illus-
trated in Table 1 were computed in order to evalu-
ate the speech dialog and the driving performance.
A detailed description and definition of the mea-
sures can be found in (Mo?ller, 2005).
In this preliminary analysis, due to time con-
straints, only the first block of each participant
could be transcribed and analyzed. In this report,

we focus on the SDS performance. Based on the
observations the task success (TS) of each speech
dialog is assessed. The speech dialog logs are used
to compute the Number of Turns (NoT) and the
dialog duration (DD) of each dialog. We assess
the concept error rate (CER) of each user utter-
ance within a dialog instead of the word error rate
(WER) since this value is crucial to a successful
speech dialog. A subjective usability assessment is
achieved by employing the SASSI questionnaire.
Based on the OpenDS logs we compute the mean
deviation (MDev) of the steering wheel. In the
next step, the reaction time, the DALI question-
naire and the final interview are analyzed.
Overall, we expect better usability evaluation
for the conversational dialog conditions compared
with the command-based condition. The partic-
ipants will accept the conversational dialog bet-
ter than the command-based dialog because if re-
flects the human-human communication. Further-
more, we expect the conversational dialog to dis-
tract less than the command-based dialog because
it is easier to control. Generally, a visual feed-
back makes it more comfortable to interact with
an SDS. Therefore, we expect the participants to
accept the SDS with GUI better than without GUI.
However, concerning the influence of the GUI on
the driving performance, we expect the GUI to
cause more driver distraction due to the glances
onto the GUI screen.
3.2 Results
In the following, the preliminary results concern-
ing SDS quality and driving performance are pre-
sented. In total, 48 command-based dialogs and
44 conversational dialogs were transcribed and an-
alyzed. First, the results of the speech dialog eval-
uation are described, followed by the results of
the driving performance evaluation. When com-
paring the two speech dialog strategies (?Comm?
vs. ?Conv?) dependent t-tests for paired exam-
ples have been applied. Concerning the compar-
ison of the 4 GUI conditions (?CommGUI? vs.
?CommNoGUI?, ?ConvGUI? vs. ?ConvNoGUI?)
238
the repeated measures anova test was applied. For
each comparison, a significance level ? =0,05 was
assumed.
3.2.1 Speech Dialog
In this Section, first, the results of the speech dia-
log performance measures are presented, followed
by the results of the questionnaires.
Task Success: In the first block of each experi-
ment, each participant had to solve 4 tasks while
data was recorded. Each of the 92 dialogs were
finished with a hotel booking. If the participant
booked a hotel, which did not match the task re-
quirements the task was annotated as failed. Fig-
ure 5 shows the percentage of solved tasks for
both speech dialog strategies (left) and addition-
ally split according to the two GUI conditions
(right). Using the command-based SDS prototype,
participants were able to solve 95,8% of the tasks.
93,8% of the tasks could be solved when using
the conversational prototype. Participants solved
tasks more effective when using the command-
based prototype with GUI than without GUI. In
contrast, the participants solved more tasks suc-
cessfully when using the conversational prototype
without GUI than with GUI. However, none of the
differences was found to be significant.

Number of Turns: Figure 6 presents the aver-
age NoT. The high number of turns is due to the
list browsing the user has to perform in order to
find the matching hotel. Using the conversational
SDS prototype, significantly fewer dialog turns
were needed than using the command-based SDS
prototype (p=0,047). The conditions without GUI
needed less turns than the conditions with GUI.
However, no significant differences were found
when comparing the conditions with GUI with the
conditions without GUI.

speech dialogs were significantly shorter than the
command-based speech dialogs (p=0,003). Com-
paring the GUI conditions within one speech di-
alog strategy, it seems that participants using the
conversational speech dialog needed less time to
accomplish a task when they could use the GUI.
However, there was no significant difference re-
vealed. Concerning the GUI conditions of the
command-based dialog, no significant differences
could be found, too.

cept errors occurred when the participants used the

SASSI: The overall result of the SASSI ques-

achieve a positive usability assessment. The con-
versational dialog is slightly better accepted by the
user. It seems that the users accept the SDS sup-
ported by a GUI better than without a GUI. How-
ever, for none of the comparisons significant dif-
ferences were found.

3.2.2 Driving Performance
In this Section a preliminary driving performance
result is presented.
Mean Deviation: Figure 10 shows the MDev of
the baseline drive (left), both speech dialog strate-
gies (middle) and additionally split according to
the two GUI conditions (right). The MDev of the
baseline drive is 0,1. The MDev was significantly
smaller when the participants used the command-
based speech dialog (p=0,01) while driving com-
pared to the conversational dialog. No significant
differences were found when comparing the con-
ditions with GUI with the conditions without GUI.

3.3 Discussion
The preliminary results show that the participants
were able to successfully finish the tasks with
both SDS prototype variants. All SDS proto-
types achieved a positive subjective usability as-
sessment. Although the CER is higher when using
the conversational dialog, it performs more effi-
cient than the command-based dialog which is due
to the possibility to input multiple parameters at
once. The MDev of the baseline drive is as high
as when using the command-based speech dialog
while driving. Usually, one would expect a bet-
ter driving performance when performing no sec-
ondary task. However, the ConTRe task is a quite
difficult task since it continuously mentally de-
mands the user. Therefore, the MDev is relatively
high when only the driving task is performed. The
conversational speech dialog distracts more from
driving than the command-based dialog. Using the
command-based dialog, the user is guided by the
system step-by-step, which makes it easier to use.
The mental demand when using the command-
based SDS might be lower and therefore, this dia-
log strategy might be less distractive.
Concerning the comparison of the GUI condi-
tions the results indicate that the conditions with
GUI are more user-friendly than the conditions
without GUI. However, we did not find any sig-
nificant differences, yet, since the data set is too
small when comparing the GUI conditions. When
the whole data set of the experiment is analyzed
further significances might be revealed.
4 Conclusions
This paper reports from a very recent driving sim-
ulation study and its preliminary results which are
conducted in order to compare different speech di-
alog strategies. The use of command-based and
conversational SDS prototypes while driving is
evaluated on usability and driving performance.
Different GUIs are designed in order to support
the respective dialog strategy the most and to eval-
uate the effect of the GUI on usability and driver
distraction. The preliminary results show that the
conversational speech dialog performs more effi-
cient than the command-based dialog. However,
the conversational dialog distracts more from driv-
ing than the command-based. Furthermore, the re-
sults indicate that an SDS supported by a GUI is
more efficient and better accepted by the user than
without GUI.
In the next step, the data set will be analyzed on
all mentioned usability and driving performance
measures. The different subdialog types of each
dialog will be investigated in detail on dialog per-
formance and speaking styles. Furthermore, cross-
links between subdialogs and the driving perfor-
mance measures are analyzed.
