Abstract 
Conversational Agents have been shown to be 
effective tutors in a wide range of educational 
domains. However, these agents are often ig-
nored and abused in collaborative learning 
scenarios involving multiple students. In our 
work presented here, we design and evaluate 
interaction strategies motivated from prior re-
search in small group communication. We 
will discuss how such strategies can be im-
plemented in agents. As a first step towards 
evaluating agents that can interact socially, we 
report results showing that human tutors em-
ploying these strategies are able to cover more 
concepts with the students besides being rated 
as better integrated, likeable and friendlier. 
1 Introduction 
Conversational Agents (CAs) are autonomous in-
terfaces that interact with users via spoken or writ-
ten conversation. One of the applications of CAs is 
tutoring. Various research groups have developed 
tutoring agents in domains like reading, algebra, 
geometry, calculus, physics, computer literacy, 
programming, foreign languages, research methods 
and thermodynamics. Many of the evaluations 
show that CAs can be effective tutors (Arnott et. 
al., 2008; Kumar et. al., 2007; Graesser et. al., 
2005). 
Most systems that use CAs as tutors have been 
built for learning scenarios involving one student. 
Evaluation of learning technologies involving stu-
dents working in groups with interactive agents has 
shown that learners are helped both by learning as 
a group and receiving tutorials from agents (Kumar 
et. al., 2007). However, some previous studies 
have reported that students learning in groups ig-
nore the tutor?s messages, unlike the case where 
students are individually tutored. Groups are more 
likely to abuse tutors than individual students.  
We reason that the presence of other students in 
collaborative learning scenarios causes the agents 
to compete for the attention of the students. Since 
the agents are not adept at performing social inter-
active behavior, which makes up the bulk of for-
mative communication in a group, they are quickly 
pushed to the periphery of the group. 
Research on small group communication has 
identified twelve interaction categories that are 
commonly observed in small groups (Bales, 1950). 
These categories are broadly classified into task 
and social-emotional categories. Content presented 
by most current CAs mostly classifies under the 
task categories. In section 2, we will list the con-
versational strategies motivated from the three pos-
itive social-emotional interaction categories. 
Thereafter, the implementation and evaluation of a 
CA that interleaves these social interaction strate-
gies while executing a task plan will be described. 
2 Social Interaction Strategies 
Balesian methodology (Bales, 1950) identifies 
three positive social-emotional interaction catego-
ries: showing solidarity, showing tension release 
and agreeing. Participants contribute turns of these 
categories to address the problems of re-
integration, tension release and decision respec-
tively. We have mapped these categories to practi-
cally implementable conversational strategies. This 
mapping is shown in table 1 ahead. 
Each strategy is implemented as an instantiation 
of a conversational behavior. Most of the strategies 
listed in Table 1 are realized as prompts, triggered 
by rules based on agent plan, discourse and context 
features. For example, strategy 1e is triggered 
677
when one or more students in the group are found 
to be inactive for over 5 minutes. In this event, the 
tutor chooses to raise the status of the inactive stu-
dents by eliciting contributions from them through 
a prompt like: Do you have any suggestions Mike? 
More implementation details of these strategies 
and triggers are discussed in the following section. 
 
1. Showing Solidarity 
Raises other's status, gives help, reward 
1a. Do Introductions 
Introduce and ask names of all participants 
1b. Be Protective & Nurturing 
Discourage teasing 
1c. Give Re-assurance 
When student is discontent, asking for help 
1d. Complement / Praise 
To acknowledge student contributions 
1e. Encourage 
When group or members are inactive 
1f. Conclude Socially 
2. Showing Tension Release 
Jokes, laughs, shows satisfaction 
2a. Expression of feeling better 
After periods of tension, work pressure 
2b. Be cheerful 
2c. Express enthusiasm, elation, satisfaction 
On completing significant steps of the task 
3. Agreeing 
Shows passive acceptance, understands, 
concurs, complies 
3a. Show attention 
To student ideas as encouragement 
3b. Show comprehension / approval 
To student opinions and orientations

3 WrenchTalker: Implementation 
WrenchTalker is a CA we have built to employ the 
social interaction strategies listed in section 2. It 
helps teams of engineering students learn and ap-
ply basic concepts of mechanical stress while they 
participate in a freshmen lab project to design an 
aluminum wrench. Students can interact with this 
agent using a text-based chat environment. 
The agent is built using the Basilica architecture 
(Kumar and Ros?, 2009). Under this architecture, 
CAs are modeled as a network of behavioral 
components. There are three types of components: 
actors (actuators / performers), filters (perceptors / 
annotators / cordinators) and memories. Figure 1 
below shows a simplified depiction of the 
WrenchTalker component network. 
 
 
Figure 1. Component Network of WrenchTalker 
Three of the actor and filter components 
correspond to three observable behaviors of the 
tutor, i.e., Introducing (ai, fi), Prompting (ap, fp) and 
Tutoring (at, ft). Most of the other filter 
components form a sub-network that annotates 
turns with applicable semantic categories, 
accumulates them to identify inactive students and 
generates events that regulate the controllers. 
The plan controller (fplan) is responsible for 
executing the agent?s interaction plan, which is 
comprised of 37 steps. The plan is executed largely 
sequentially; however the plan controller can 
choose to skip some steps in the interest of time. In 
the experiment described in section 5, the same 
plan controller is used in all three conditions. The 
social controller (fsocial) implements the 12 
strategies listed earlier. The strategies are triggered 
by rules based on combinations of three 
conditions: the last executed plan step, semantic 
categories associated with the most recent student 
turns and the ratio of tutor turns generated by fsocial 
to fplan. The first two conditions attempt to ensure 
that social behavior is suitable in the current 
conversational context and the third condition 
regulates the amount of social behavior by the CA. 
The plan and social controllers are connected so 
that they regulate each other. For instance, when 
the plan controller is working, it blocks fsocial. Upon 
completion of the blocking step, fsocial is given 
control, which can then choose to perform a 
strategy by blocking fplan before it progresses to the 
next step. Reflex strategies like 1b are not blocked. 
Once the controllers determine a step or a strat-
egy that is to be generated, the actors generate their 
turns. For example, strategy 1a is generated by ac-
tor ai after it is triggered by the social controller. 
We note that Basilica provides the flexibility to 
build complicated pipelines, as demonstrated in 
this case by the use of two controllers.

4 Related Work 
To contextualize our research with other work on 
CAs, we classify agents with the social interaction 
strategies listed in Table 1 as social interfaces fol-
lowing the taxonomy proposed by Isbister (2002). 
Within this class of CAs, researchers have investi-
gated the technical challenges and effects of con-
versational behavior that are similar in motivation 
to the ones we are exploring. Bickmore et. al. 
(2009) report that users found agents with autobio-
graphies, i.e., back stories in first person more en-
joyable and they completed more conversations 
with such agents. Dybala et. al. (2009) found that 
agents equipped with humor were evaluated as 
more human-like, funny and likeable. In a multi-
party conversational scenario, Dohsaka et. al. 
(2009) found that an agent?s use of emphatic ex-
pressions improved user satisfaction and user rat-
ing of the agent. We note that use of CAs as social 
interfaces has been found to have effects on both 
performance and perception metrics. 
5 Experimental Design 
In order to evaluate the effect of social interaction 
strategies listed in Table 1, we designed an expe-
riment with three conditions. In the experimental 
condition (Social), students interacted with an 
agent that was equipped with our social interaction 
strategies, unlike the control condition (Task). In 
the third condition, a human tutor was allowed to 
intervene while the students interacted with a Task 
agent. In all three conditions, students go through 
the same task plan. However, the degree of social 
performance is varied from minimal (Task) to ideal 
(Human). We hypothesize that the human and so-
cial agents will be rated better than the Task agent. 
We conducted a between subjects experiment 
during a freshmen computer aided engineering lab. 
98 students participated in the experiment, which 
was held over six sessions spread evenly between 
two days. The two days of the experiment were 
separated by two weeks. Students were grouped 
into teams of three to four individuals. Students 
were grouped so that no two members of the same 
team sat next to each other during the lab, to en-
sure all communication was recorded. The teams 
were distributed between the three conditions. 
Each session started with a follow-along tutori-
al of computer-aided analysis where the students 
analyzed a wrench they had designed earlier. The 
experimental manipulation happened during a col-
laborative design competition after the tutorial. 
Students were asked to work as a team to design a 
better wrench considering three aspects: ease of 
use, cost and safety. Students were instructed to 
make three new designs and calculate success 
measures of each of the three considerations. They 
were also told that a tutor will help them with two 
designs so that they are well-prepared to do the 
final design. No additional details about the tutor 
were given. The students communicated with each 
other and with the tutors using ConcertChat, an on-
line environment that provides text-based instant 
messaging and workspace sharing facilities. 
After spending 30-35 minutes on the design 
competition, each student filled out a question-
naire. It was comprised of eighteen questions on a 
seven point Likert-scale ranging from Strongly 
Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (7). The questions 
were designed to elicit four types of ratings. 
? Ratings about the tutor 
? Ratings about the other team members 
? Ratings about the design task 
? Ratings about the team functioning 
The questions in the first two classes elicited 
perceived liking and integration and checked 
whether the students noticed the tutor?s display of 
the social interaction strategies. Task related ques-
tions asked about satisfaction, perceived legitimacy 
and discussion quality.

Table 2 below shows the mean values for ques-
tionnaire categories apart from ratings about team 
members, since there were no significant effects 
related to those questions.

differences from Day1 to Day2 and between the 
Task condition and each of the other two using a 
pairwise Tukey comparison. 
First of all, we note that there is a significant 
difference in task satisfaction between the two 
days. We fine-tuned the timing parameters of the 
plan controller after day 1 so that the students had 
sufficient time to follow along with each of the 
steps. This was particularly useful for the task con-
dition where the steps would be executed rapidly 
due to lack of regulation by the social controller. 
On the right side of Table 2, we notice that the 
human tutors (H) were rated higher on being part 
of the team (Integration), being more liked, being 
friendlier and keeping the group more socially 
comfortable (T.Releasing). On the other hand, the 
social tutors (S) were rated to be friendlier and 
were only marginally better at being seen as part of 
the team.

Note that human tutors were restricted to exhi-
bit only social behaviors, which were displayed in 
addition to the same task related content given to 
students in the other two conditions. Clearly, the 
human tutors were better at employing the social 
interaction strategies. To further investigate this, 
we compare the number of turns corresponding to 
the broad categories of strategies in Table 3. Hu-
man tutors performed significantly more (p<0.001) 
social turns than the automated tutors in all strate-
gies except showing tension release. 
7 Conclusions 
In order to make CAs that can participate in multi-
party conversational scenarios, the agents must be 
able to employ Social Interaction Strategies. Here 
we have shown that the human tutors that use these 
strategies are better integrated into the group, and 
are considered more likeable and friendlier. These 
tutors also cover more steps and concepts and take 
less time to tutor the concepts, suggesting that the 
students are more engaged and responsive to them. 
On the other hand, automated tutors that employ 
these strategies in our current implementation do 
not show significant differences compared to task 
tutor. 
We note a contrast between the performance of 
the human and the automated tutors with respect to 
the frequency with which they employ these strat-
egies. Besides the frequent use of these strategies, 
we believe human tutors were better at identifying 
opportunities for employing these strategies, and 
they are able to customize the prompt to better suit 
the discourse context.
