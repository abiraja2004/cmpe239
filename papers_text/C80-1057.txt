We wish to explore some of the aspects 
of the explo i tat ion of two d ict ionary f i l es  
by LONGHAN Ltd, one for 'core '  \[mglish and 
one for Imglish idioms. 
We'll t ry  to show the feas ib i l i ty  of  an 
approach to language processing based on a 
lexicon, conceived of as the repository of 
grammatical, semantic and knowledge-of-the- 
world information. 
After giving a br ie f  descr ipt ion of the 
computer :files (Section I) we ' l l  focus on the 
following points : 
a) a lexical  approach to granmar allows 
a considerable s impl i f icat ion of the PSG 
component of  a parsing system (Section I I ,  
Part One)~ 
b) the syntact ic  potent ia l  of many 
lexemes (at surface structure level) can 
serve as a guide to the i r  deep structure 
configurations (Section I I sPart  Two)j 
c) provided that a d ict ionary makes use 
of a l imited defining vocabulary, the texts of 
the d ict ionary def in i t ions can be processed on 
the basis of corre lat ions between syntact ic  
structures ( f i l l ed  with individual lexenms or 
lexemes belonging to speci f iable classes) and 
semantic re lat ionships uch as that between a 
process verb and an instrument (Section I I I ) .  
SECTION I. DESCRIPTION OF THE COxlPUTER FILES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
A contract with LON@IAN Ltd has made it 
possible for us to have access to the computer 
files of two dictionaries, LDOCE (LONDON 
DICTIONARY OF CONTF~IPORARY ENGLISH) and LDOEI 
(LON(~IAN DICTIONAI~OF ENGLISII IDIOMS). I% 
have had the LDOCE file for some time but have 
only just received the LDOEI one. 
spe~c~aThe features LDOCE make of  which it 
lly useful for language processing are 
the following : 
a) it reflects the surface structure 
environment of its entries by means of a 
sophisticated system of grammatical codes, 
most of which can be thought of as strict 
subcategorization features. For instance, 
IDOCE specifies 
i.- that nouns like FACT or CLAIM can be 
followed by a THAT-clause, 
2.- that a verb such as WATCH can occur follo- 
wed by an NP followed by an ING-form (we 
watched the soldiers bleeding). 
Though it is mainly concerned with 
SURFACE structure, LDOCE nevertheless distin- 
guishes between an NP pair follow in~ GIVE (He 
gaveJhi.s b.rotl!e~la new bicycle) \[DJcode 
NP I N 2 
and one following CO~SIDER (He considered 
this brother, a f ~ )  ~X1lcode 
T NP 1 NP 2 - -  
b) through a system of semantic codes of 
the Katz-and-Fodor type (these codes do ~mt 
appear in the printed version of the d ict iona-  
ry),  LDOCE places semantic res t r i c t ions  on the 
subjects and objects of verbs (or on the type 
of noun that an adject ive can modify), speci-  + ing for instance that PERSUADE requires a t~A~ object ,  and EXTFNPORIZE a \[+ ItU~4AN~ 
subject. 
c) LDOCE makes use of a defining vocabula- 
ry of some 2,000 items - all the definitions 
and all the examples associated with the 60,000 
entries are couched in that restricted vocabu- 
lary. 
Concerning points a and b it should be 
emphasized that the gra~natical and semantic 
codes can appear at two different levels : 
i.- ENTRY level : the code is appropriate to 
all the definitions of the entry in ques- 
tion, 
2.- DEFINITION level : the code is not appro- 
priate to the whole entry (i.e. in all its 
senses) but only to those readings that 
correspond to the definitions that the 
code is tagged to. 
For instance, READ cannot be assigned the 
same grammatical and semantic codes in senten- 
ces 1 and 2 : 
1.-  He rnana~e~ tr~ ro.ad nt \]~a.~t r~no honk 
every day 
2.- Your paper doesn't  read too well. 
This second level makes i t  possible to 
avoid a pro l i fe ra t ion  of indiscriminate d is -  
junctions in the spec i f icat ion of the codes to 
be associated with a given lexeme. It seems to 
us that by restricting the occurrence of code 
specifications at only one level (nmnely, the 
374 
i~NTRY level), one reduces the predictive power 
of both grammatical and semantic codes to 
practically nil in the case of complex entries. 
On the ot\]~r hand, the codes that are appro- 
priate at DEFINITION level provide an interes- 
ting type of correlation between strict sub- 
categorization and selection rules on the one 
hand and choice of appropriate reading on the 
other : such a type of correlation is bound to 
prove very useful for machine translation pur- 
poses. 
voc~au ~ing  to the use of the same defining 
lary, LDOEI is a natural extension of 
LDOCE. Whereas the latter merely lists the 
idiomatic phrases under the relevant headwords, 
LDOEI gives the information necessary for re- 
cognizing and generating all the syntactic and 
morphological variants of each idi~n. To give 
only one example, in the entry "TELL ? I WHERE 
TO GET OFF IV : Pass 2\]" the sign o indicates 
that ~LL  admits of morphological variation 
in this phrase, I specifies the place of the 
indirect object (which does not belong to the 
idiomatic phrase as such) and the grammatical 
note iV : Pass 2Jinforms the user that the 
syntactic value of the ~4~ole phrase is verbal 
(i. e. that it functions as a VP) and that the 
passive is to be formed by selecting the 
indirect object as subject (,'Ib was told where 
to get off"). 
(LONGMAN LEXICON) 
~\] is  forthcoming thesaurus is also 
designed to t ie  in with LDOCE, of  which i t  is 
par t ly  a by-product.  As Section I I I  wi l l  make 
clear, our analysis of LDOCE definitions will 
have to rely on a thesaurus, but we do not 
know yet whether LOLEX will be available in 
machine-readable form. 
SECTION II. TOWAPd)S A S~4ANTICALLY ENRICI~JD 
SURFACE PARSER BASED ON LDOCE 
I . -  ~_!~!~!!z_~_~.  
It stands to reason that automatic parsing 
programmes have to have access to at least two 
linguistic components : a grammar and a lexicon. 
In most systems that we know something 
about, the gra~nar is a good deal more sophis- 
ticated than the lexicon. The latter includes 
only a small sub-part of the total lexicon for 
the language under study, while the grsmar 
takes care of a large proportion of the basic 
gran~natical structures. 
We would like to explore a diametrically 
opposed approach : our starting-point is a 
sophisticated lexicon for co:re English and our 
aim is to make maximum use of the information 
it contains to keep our grmmnar within strict 
bounds. 
An obvious first step in developing a 
parser based on LDOCE is to write algorithms 
that translate the various grammatical codes 
into scanning procedures . Most of these algo- 
rithms are fairly straightforward and have 
already been written. What we would like to 
focus on here is the simplification of the cate- 
gorial component that such a lexically based 
syntax permits. Consider 3 : 
3. The claim that he has succeeded is patent- 
ly false. Since there is a code (namely, 5 ) 
that stipulates whether an element (in this 
case, a countable noun coded C - the whole 
code is therefore \[~51 ) can be followed by a 
~IAT-clause, we will not attempt to account 
for T~T-clauses via rewrite rules for the cate- 
gory NP, i. e. we won't have such a rule as : 
NP---~NP ~T S 
Naturally enough, there is no LDOCE code sti- 
pulating that a noun can be followed by a rela- 
tive clause (such a code would be meaningless 
since virtually all nouns can have a relative 
clause - if not a restrictive, thln at least an 
appositive one - tagged on their right). We will 
therefore have to include relative clauses some- 
where in our rewrite rules for the category NP. 
Here too, however, the lexical approach to syn- 
tax can prove useful. To show this, let us 
first define a CONCATENATION as a string every 
member of which is tied to some other by means 
of a LDOCE grammatical code (it requires the 
other member for the satisfaction of its code 
or it serves to satisfy the other member's 
code). The concept of CONCATENATION can be 
equated with that of CLAUSE if it is extended 
to cover : 
i.- free elements, i, e. elements which are not 
bound to one particular word or phrase in- 
side the clause (both sentential adjuncts 
and linking words such as conjunctions 
would fall into this category). 
2.- a subject role, i. e. the creation of a 
link between a tensed V (the starting-point 
for the concatenation - see below) and an 
NP to be found on its right or on its left. 
We have already looked into the mechanisms 
of tensed V searches and subject role assign- 
ments and we have found that various properties 
of English make the task of algorithmizing 
these mechanisms less formidable than it 
appears at first sight. The most prominent 
among these properties are the following : 
I.- the conditions of use of the auxiliary DO; 
2.- the fact that only tensed Vs require a 
subject; 
3.- the fact that only the first (i. e. left- 
most) member of a verbal ~roup can bear 
tense; 
4.- the fact that it must bear tense; 
S.- the morphological contrast between verb and 
noun with respect to m~ber (- S marks sin- 
gular verbs but plural nouns). 
Turning now to relative clauses, we see 
that we can characterize them with great ease : 
a relative clause is s concatenation that opens 
with a relative phrase (one of whose realiza- 
tions is ~ and another the multi-purpose word 
THAT, so that a recognition procedure based on 
375- 
the occurrence of particular morphemes is bound 
to fail in some cases) and that misses an NP 
(it is this second property that has to be re- 
garded as essential). 
The readers who are familiar with Hudson 
1976 will have realized that the approach 
advocated here is nearer to Hudson's version of 
systemic gra~nar than to transfornmtional gram- 
mar : we make full use of sister-dependencies, 
starting with the tensed V, which we believe to 
provide the best entry-point into the network 
of relationships woven by the various code- 
bearing elements in a sentence. 
II.- _Dee_~_st~Ljcture_conf_igkjratitins _. 
It is obvious that our parser will have to 
be able to : 
I.- recognize the situations in which the basic 
order of the constituents (i. e. the one 
stipulated in the scanning procedures asso- 
ciated with the gra~atical codes) is dis- 
rupted under the effect of transformations 
such as PASSIVIZATION, TOPICALIZATION, 
PJ~LATIVE CLAUSE FOt~IATION, GAPPING, . . . )  
2.- keep track of the constituents that have 
been moved. 
We do not intend to deal with these 
points here but we would like to stress that 
the problems for RECOGNITION are very different 
from those for GENERATION. RAISING and EQUI, 
for instance, are rather formidable and 
problem-ridden rules from the point of view 
of generation but we shall argue that we do not 
need their counterparts for recognition pur- 
poses. We shall illustrate this point by look- 
ing at verb complementation - at the same time 
we will show that the syntactic potential of a 
verb can be used as a guide to its deep 
structure configuration. 
In a VP the SYNTACTIC head is always the 
first, i. e. tensed verb. As we have seen, the 
way the parser builds up concatenations re- 
flects this property. As for the SEMANTIC head, 
it is very often another verb than the first 
one. This, however, does not matter in so far as 
the auxiliaries and semi-m~xiliaries (IIAPPiZ~4, 
SEEM, ...) do not have any semantic code asso- 
ciated with them and can therefore be regarded 
as semantically transparent : they have no 
effect whatsoever on the pailts that the 
semantic component will be called on to examine 
for compatibility. Consider such a sentence 
as4  : 
4.- b{y father seems to have been reading too 
many strips. 
11-te starting-point for building the 
concatenation would be the tensed V, i. e. 
SED{S : the concatenation would be allowed to 
grow both to the left (assigrunent of subject 
role to the NP 'my father') and to the right : 
he~appropriate syntactic code for SEI~,IS is 
3J here (i. e. followed by an infinitive 
with TO) : g .~ 
ub~j  e~t fathers s e e m ~  
NP/ ~atisf igs g3 \ ]  code of SED.~S 
SI!Di is not coded semantically, so that the 
semantic component would not be called on at 
this stage. In the next step, IIAVE would be 
examined and its ~I ~ code seen to be 
applicable ~ 8Jspecifies that the code-bearing 
element be followed by an EN-form) so that a 
new sister dependency would be established : 
_ . /4-- -~ ~ 
My father seems to have |been J 
sa~tisfies CI 8J code of HAVE 
In similar fashion, BEEN would have an 
~13~ code (i. e. + ING-form) satisfied by 
IIEADING : 
!ly lather seems to nave been reading 
Neither HAVE nor BE are semantically 
coded with restrict to the definitions that have 
been chosen onYDasis of the grammatical codes 
that are satisfied in the sentence .~ READING 
on the other hand, will be coded sy~ttactically 
(it requires one NP as object-code ~Ti| ) and 
semantically (it requires a ~ ~ANJ  subject). 
Since SED4, HAVE and BEEN are semantically 
transparent, the semantic component will exa- 
mine the pair ~JX father and re.ading and find 
them to be compatible as a subject-verb configu- 
ration. But how does the parser know that 
fathe__j is the subject of reading ? A very 
simple-minded rule states that there is no 
change in subject in a verbal complex as long 
as there is no interrupting NP; if there is one, 
it is to be regarded as the subject of the 
following verb(s) : 
I want to read -~ 
I started to read ~ subject of READ 
"i happened to be reading. 
Y want g~. to ready ~" 
I saw you read ing~you subject of READ 
I made ~ read 
This rule admits of at least one exception, 
namely PROMISE : 
I promised you to read (I subject of READ 
in spite of interrupting YOU). 
Another problem relating to deep structure 
configurations is that of determining, in 
v + NP + J (TO) + INFINrrIVE l 
+ ING-FOR~ J 
structures, whether the NP is to be regarded as 
the object of the V or not (contrast 'I want 
him to go' with 'I persuaded him to go'). 
Instead of going into each deep structure 
distinction that can be drawn within the field 
of verb complementation, we will show that the 
verb classes which Akmajian and Heny 1975 
(p. 364 and fell.) find it necessary to set up 
in their introduction to transformational 
grammar to account for deep structure distinc- 
tions (Figure i) can be held apart on the 
basis of their surface structure potential as 
captured in their LDOCE gran~natical codes.

The NP fo l lowing the verb is its deep 
ob ject  only in the case of Class II 
verbs (I persuaded him to go ~ I  
persuaded him); there is no NP in Class 
IV (* I fa i led him to go) and the NP is 
not the object  in Class I or in Class 
III (I want him to go ~ I  want  him; I 
bel ieve him to have gone-4-~I  bel ieve | r  
him) . 
As for PROMISE (not d iscussed in  
Akmaj ian  and Heny 1975) it could be 
def ined by means of the fo l lowing 
feature row : + T3, + T5, + V 3 : 
I promised to go (T3) 
I promised him to ~o (V3) 
I promised that I would go (T5) 
The NP between PROMISE and the TO- 
INF INIT IVE is the object  (as in the 
PERSUADE class) but it is not the sub- 
ject of the inf in i t ive.  
SECTION THREE : LDOCE DEF IN IT IONS : AN 
IR APPROACH TO SEMANTIC AND KNOWLEDGE-OF-  
THE-WORLD INFORMATION. 
/ 
LDOCE def in i t ions  convey semantic  infor- 
mat ion in a fair ly expl ic i t ,  but non- 
formatted, form. Even though all def in i -  
t ions are wr i t ten in a DEFINING VOCABU- 
LARY (not to be confused with a BASIC 
VOCABULARY - see below), no at tempt has 
been made to stick to a l imited number 
of DEFINING FORMULAE. To g ivean  example 
of what we mean by DEFINING FORMULA, and 
to ant ic ipate  on what wi l l  be the main 
concern of this section, we wish to look 
at the class of INSTRUMENTS.  In theory, 
it could be agreed by the d ic t ionary-  
makers that all inst ruments  have to 
include the phrase " instrument  used for 
Ving" in their def in i t ions .  In such a 
def in ing formula the word INSTRUMENT 
would be a DEFINING PR IMIT IVE  and the 
pred icate  USED FOR would be a DEFINING 
RELATION (in this case, between an 
instrument  and a predicate) .  Such a kind 
of formatted def in i t ion  would be less 
prec ise and less exact, but inf in i te ly  
more usable, than a common type def in i -  
tion. Smith and Maxwel l  1973 (p2) point  
out that in a typical  d ic t ionary  
approx imate ly  50 % of the vocabulary  
appears in the def in i t ions .  LDOCE is a 
major improvement  on such a typical  
d ic t ionary  in that its def in ing 
--377-- 
vocabulary  is restr ic ted to some 2,000 
items (used to def ine some 60,000 
entr ies).  My purpose in this sect ion is 
to ref lect  on the poss ib i l i ty  of 
turning a s ign i f i cant  number of LDOCE 
def in i t ions  into ful ly formatted ones 
(i.e. making use of def in ing formulae).  
Consider the sentence : 
I saw the man in the park with a 
te lescope 
\ [Woods  in Rust in 1973, p. 17~ 
The PREFERRED reading is the one that 
assoc iates  'with a telescope' with the 
pred icate  'saw' rather than with either 
of the NP heads 'man' or 'park' : 'saw 
with a telescope' rather than 'man with 
a telescope' or 'park with a telescope'. 
If we had ava i lab le  a formatted def in i -  
t ion of TELESCOPE (" instrument used for 
seeing ..."), there would be no 
prob lem in a system of p re ferent ia l  
semant ics  : the l ink between 'saw' and 
'telescope' (embodied in the def in i t ion  
of the latter) would lead to the 
se lect ion of the pre fer red reading on 
the basis of the DENSEST MATCH FIRST 
pr inc ip le.  As a matter of fact, the 
LDOCE def in i t ion  for 'telescope' is 
very near ly  what we need : 
"a tubel ike sc ient i f ic  instrument 
used for seeing d is tant  ob jects  by 
making them appear nearer and 
larger" 
A s imple matching procedure  between our 
suggested def in ing formula for 
instruments  and the LDOCE def in i t ion  
for 'telescope' would have been 
suf f ic ient  in this case. The problem, 
of course, is that there is abso lute ly  
no guarantee that the def in ing formula 
wi l l  be part of the def in i t ion  of all 
instruments.  HAMMER, for instance, is 
def ined as : 
"a tool with a heavy head for 
dr iv ing nai ls into wood or for 
str ik ing things to break them or 
move them" (Def in i t ion I) 
No simple procedure wi l l  assoc iate  
INSTRUMENT with HAMMER. The fact that 
LDOCE makes use of a def in ing vocabu- 
lary, however,  ensures that the defining 
noun (TOOL in this case) is a member of 
a f in ite list, namely the LDOCE defining 
vocabulary  itself. One can go a step 
further and make the hypothes is  that 
the def in ing noun wi l l  belong to a 
def in i te  subset wi th in  the def in ing 
vocabulary.  One can go through that 
vocabulary  and select  the words that 
could stand for INSTRUMENTS.  The subset 
that this procedure y ie lds can fair ly 
eas i ly  be d iv ided into two further 
groups : on the one hand one f inds 
such genera l  words as TOOL and APPARATUS 
(note that the latter would not be 
included in a BASIC VOCABULARY) which 
could also be used in def in ing formulae; 
on the other hand one has to include 
such speci f ic  items as BOAT, B ICYCLE 
and GUN, which are instances of instru- 
ments. The second group is of course 
much more prob lemat ic  than the f i rst  : 
one has to be concerned with TYPICAL 
instruments,  o therw ise  all PHYSICAL 
OBJECTS would have to be included : 
He hit her with the tail of a dead 
snake. 
The INSTRUMENT reading of the 'with' - 
phrase is not due to any intr ins ic  
property  of either 'tail' or 'snake', 
but rather to four factors : 
--378-- 
a) WITH often introduces an instrumental 
adjunct; 
b) the 'with' -phrase in this sentence 
cannot be read as postmodi fy ing  
'her'; 
c) it cannot  be read as an accompaniment 
adjunct  for 'he' either; 
d) the pred icate  'hit' can take an 
instrumental  adjunct.  
The reader wi l l  have not iced that 
factors a, c and d also apply - mutatis 
mutandis  - to the example involving the 
predicate SEE. This, however, does not 
imply that the link between TELESCOPE 
and SEE was of no use in preferr ing the 
instrument reading for the 'with' 
-phrase - note that 'with a telescope' 
COULD postmodi fy  the NP heads 'man' and 
'park'; besides, even if it could not, 
we would sti l l  have to find a way of 
tel l ing the system and this task may 
wel l  prove cons iderab ly  more formidable 
than that of assoc iat ing instruments 
and predicates.  
The fo l lowing items in the LDOCE 
def in ing vocabulary  could be regarded 
as making up the subset for the 
concept  INSTRUMENT :

NOTES 
I. For all items in both groups, 
POS (Part of Speech) = n 
2. All items in Group I - except MEANS, 
which is itself a head - appear 
under the head TOOL in Roget's 
Thesaurus.  
3. In Group II the items fol lowed by 
\ [R \ ]  occur in Roger's Thesaurus under 
the head TOOL. 
--379-- 
4. The under l ined items in Group II are 
more general  and could perhaps be 
s ingled out in a third group, 
intermediate between I and II. 
Obviously,  the l ists as such are not 
suf f ic ient  for our purpose  : words such 
as SPRING and MEDICINE are not re levant 
to the INSTRUMENT concept in some of 
their most f requent  uses - for our 
purposes the def in ing vocabulary  should 
not have been l imited to a l ist of 
LEXICAL ITEMS; in case of po lysemic  
words, numbers should have been added 
to make clear which def in i t ions  were to 
be assoc iated with the def in ing word : 
SPRING I (= a source), 2 (= a season), 
4 (= elast ic i ty) ,  5 (= an act ive 
heal thy quality) and 6 (= an act of 
spr inging),  are not re levant  to the 
INSTRUMENT concept. Since - in theory - 
the noun SPRING can be used with all 
six meanings in LDOCE def in i t ions,  its 
inc lus ion in our l ist is l iable to 
prove detr imenta l  : it can lead the 
system to assoc iate the INSTRUMENT 
concept  with a def in ing word that has 
nothing to do with instrumental i ty ?  
Going back to the LDOCE def in i t ion  for 
HAMMER, we real ize that the a lgor i thm 
that wi l l  assoc iate instruments and 
predicates  wi l l  have to take into 
account, not only the Ving form (in the 
formula 'for Ving'),  but also its 
object; otherwise a hammer is going to 
be thought of as a kind of vehic le : 
Compa r e 
a tool ... for driving DRIVE 1 2/3 in LDOCE 
with 
a tool ... for driving DRIVE 1 5/6 in LDOCE 
nails 
A second d i f f i cu l ty  that we must face 
up to is that there may be no def in ing 
NOUN, but an a l l -purpose indef in i te 
such as SOMETHING or ANYTHING. In that 
case, however,  the INSTRUMENT concept 
is l ikely to be expressed somewhere 
else in the def in i t ions,  by means of 
(USED) FOR Ving, for instance. This 
last point  leads us to an examinat ion 
of the var ious ways in which the link 
between instrument and predicate can be 
conveyed; the existence of a def in ing 
vocabulary  is a help but the range of 
SYNTACTIC poss ib les  remains enormous; 
however, there is something that could 
be cal led the LEX ICOGRAPHICAL  TRADIT ION 
and fami l iar i ty  with that t radi t ion can 
help cut down on the number of poss ib le  
formulae - the fo l lowing stand a good 
chance of being rather heavi ly  used : 
\[~OME THING

"INSTRUMENT ...

Obviously,  process ing LDOCE def in i t ions  
is a lot of work in terms of the 
necessary a lgor i thms and in terms of 
the sheer volume of language data to be 
scrut in ized.  We suggest  that a useful  
approach is provided by IR ( Information 
Retrieval) techniques as embodied in 
- -380--  
the IBM system known as STAIRS. 
STAIRS processes  var ious objects,  which 
can be worked into the fo l lowing 
h ierarchy : 
DOCUMENTS (TOP) / 
PARAGRAPHS / 
SENTENCES / 
WORDS (BOTTOM) 
The var ious paragraphs of a g iven 
document  can be ass igned labeL5, so 
that the search wi th in  a s ingle 
document  can be or iented.  
STAIRS prov ides  a number of SEARCH 
OPERATORS, which wi l l  be br ie f ly  char-  
acter ized below. A ~77~,?/ search 
operator  can be used to link any o{ the 
fo l lowing three categor ies  : 
I. word tokens, e.g. DISEASES, APPLIES,  
COMPUTERIZED,  IF~ 
2.a) stems, e.g. RUN-, ANTAGONIZ- ,  
MOTHER-  (the use of a character  mask 
enables the system to ass ign RUNNING 
RUNS, RUNNER, RUNNERS, etc. to the 
stem RUN-) and b) lexemes for which 
STAIRS generates  the morpho log ica l  
var iants~ 
3. any express ion  cons is t ing of elements 
of type I or 2 l inked by STAIRS 
SEARCH OPERATORS (the def in i t ion  is 
therefore recursive,  and al lows any 
degree of embedding) .  
Let A and B stand for e lements 
be longing to any of the above three 
types. The operato~that  STAIRS 
works with are the fo l lowing : 
A ADJ B : A and B occur next to 
each other and in that 
order in the document  
to be retr ieved. 
A SYN B : A and B are to be re- 
garded as synonymS\[or  
a g iven search operation 
A WITH B : A and B occur in the 
same sentence 
A SAME B : A and B occur in the 
same paragraph 
NOT B : B doesn ' t  occur in the 
document  to be retrieved 
A AND B : both A & B 
A OR B : inclusive OR 
A XOR B : exc lus ive OR 
In our system the STAIRS h ierarchy would 
cor respond to the fo l lowing : 
A. A DOCUMENT -A HOMOGRAPH (e.g. 
DOUBT 2) or AN ENTRY 
WITHOUT HOMOGRAPHS 
(e.g. PONDEROUS) in 
the LDOCE fi le 
B. A PARAGRAPH -a spec i f ied F IELD 
wi th in  A, e.g. POS 
(part of speech), 
GRAMMATICAL  CODE, 
SEMANTIC CODE, TEXT 
OF THE DEFINIT ION, . . .  
C. A SENTENCE -any sentence included 
in the text of a given 
de f in i t ion  
D. A WORD -the var ious words 
wi th in  a def in i t ion  
or the var ious codes 
and POS wi th in  a code 
field or a POS field. 
It wi l l  be apparent  that in order to 
rewrite FIG. 2 as a set of search oper-  
at ions in a STAIRS - l ike system we 
need to be able to refer to speci f ied 
morpho log ica l  analyses.  Moreover,  V and 
NP are neither  word tokens nor stems : 
they refer to categor ies  ( respect ively 
lexical  and phrase structure) and we 
wi l l  have to extend the poss ib i l i t ies  of 
the system so that such categor ies  can 
be included in the express ions  guiding 
the search and retr ieva l  operat ions.  
Phrase structure categor ies  are a hard 
nut to crack, and we wi l l  probably  have 
to do wi thout  them in a f irst stage, but 
lexical  categor ies  such as V can be 
housed in a STAIRS - l ike system : a V 
is the name of any document  that includes 
V among its POS - paragraph.  
Leaving aside the reference to NPs, 
FIG. 2 can be rewr i t ten as a complex 
STAIRS - l ike search operation with six 
levels. The embedding of STAIRS ex- 
press ions  wi th in  STAIRS express ions  
gives rise to the use of labels such as 
--381-- 
At, BI, etc; the co lon  is to be read 
as "can be def ined as""  
AI OR A2 
AI : BI WITH B2 
BI :~NYTHING'  OR 'SOMETHING' 
B2 : CI OR C2 OR C3 
CI :---'USE~- WITH 'FOR' 
ADJ V- ING 
C2 : ~-~R ~ ADJ V- ING 
C3 : 'MADE' ADJ 'TO' ADJ V 
A2 : B3 WITH B4 
B3 . '~NSTRUMENT'  OR SYN- 
INSTRUMENT 
B4 : C4 OR C5 OR C6 OR C7 
C4 ~--DI AD--J D2 - -  
DI : 'WHICH' OR 'THAT' 
D2  : Vs OR EI-'OR E2 
El : 'CANrADJ V

C7 : D3 OR D4 
D3 'USED' WITH 
'FOR' ADJ V- ING 
D4 : 'FOR' ADJ V- ING _ _  - - - - -  
N o t e  that to be real ly useful, the 
a lgor i thms that assoc iate pred icates  
and instruments should have access to 
a thesaurus- l ike  c lass i f i cat ion  of 
predicates.  Take for instance the defi -  
n i t ion of M ICROSCOPE : 
"an instrument that makes very small  
near objects  seem larger, and so can 
be used for examining them" 
The pre ferent ia l  l ink is between 
MICROSCOPE and EXAMINE and a sentence 
such as : 
"He examined the new virus with an 
extremely  power fu l  microscope"  
wi l l  be interpreted the r ight way. But 
what about 
"He studied the new virus with an 
extremely  powerfu l  microscope"  ? 
We could get around this prob lem if we 
had access to a thesaurus like Roget's: 
since STUDY and EXAMINE share a SUBHEAD 
in Roget's, viz. SCAN in 438 VISION, a 
link between STUDY and MICROSCOPE 
could be establ ished.
