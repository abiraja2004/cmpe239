he used. hi one of tile approaches all availahle engines 
are "unleashed" on an input text and file liJml otntpul is 
assembled from the best rex! segmeras, i,'respective of  
which engine prodtmcd them. We. call this approach 
lhe Best Otttput Segment (B()S) approach, hi another 
approach a heuristic "dispatcher" decides which of the 
available engines holds tile highest p,-omise for it given 
input text and then assigns the job to that engine. This is 
tile DiSlmtcher-Based (DB) approach. The B()S approach 
involves more processing bill ~lllows an ,.7 posreriori se- 
lection of the best results. Tile DB approach saves cycles 
but relies on heuristic ,,., priori selection of the best oulput. 
hi this latter case, lhe quality of the dispalchermodule is 
crucial, but additionally, the DP, approach expecls each c,f 
the component engines to be of rather Irish quality, since 
they would not (as is the case in lhe BOS apF, rOach) he 
"bailed onl" hy olher engines in case of failure. 
hi what lk-dlows we hrielly describe our lirst experiment 
with tile B()S approach and discuss tile requirements for 
tile DB approach. 
2. The  Best  Output  Segment  Appr tmch to  
Adapt lv i ty  
()ur B()S Itpproach experiment was cmried out lor a Span- 
ish - English Iranslation sel-u F, in the fran/ework of Ihe 
Pangloss MT project (F'angloss, 1994)and used Ihrce. MT 
engines - -  KBMT, EBMT, and TBMT. 
Tile KBMT engine we used was tile. mainline engine 
of tile Pangh./ss ystem, a lradilional KBMT environment 
described in some detail in (Pangloss, 1994). It was im- 
portant for tile BOS experiment that this engine genernlcd 
an internal quality rating for each OUtlmt segment it pro- 
duced. 
The tmsic idea of EBMT ix simple (cf. Nagao, 19g4): 
an input passage S is comlmred with the sourcc-I:mguage 
"side" of a bilingual exl archive, where lexl passages are 
slored witll their Iransllitions ill|() It flu'gel langtmge (or a 
set of such). TIle "closesl" matcll, passage S' is selecled 
and lhe lranslation of lhis clos'ast malch, the passage 7" is 
accepled as tile IranslaliOn of S. Our EBMT engine iiscd 
a 100MB bilingual Spmfish - English archive of UN cdti- 
cial documents, hi preparation fc, r processir~g, die archive 
was idigned at tile sentence level. Tile lnalching of input 
passages with the Spanish side of the archive was allowed 
to be inexact. Penalties were assessed for omitted and ex- 
Ira words, word occurrences ill different rnorphological 
forms and differences in word order. The English siring 
lranslaling lhe best Spanish archive candidale wlts then 
lound in tile English sentence aligned with tile Spanish 
sentence in which lhe hest match candidme appea,',ad. A
.Spanish - English MRD win; used in determining Iransht- 
lions of individual words inside the candidale segmenis. 
A special ronlinc then calculated lhe expected quality o1 
the resulting Iranslatiorl, which helped .;it lhe restlll inle- 
gralion stage of nnllti-engine MT syslenl operaliOn. ()ur 
EBMT approach ix described in Nirenln.~g el al., 1993 
and Nirenburg ,at al., s.bmiHed). 
Our transfer systenl was very simple. It was Ilascd on 
direct Icxical substitution fo English words and phrases 
for Spanish words and phrase, forlilied wilh n/orpholog- 
ical analysis at/d synlhesis modifies. Tile process relied 
on ii tltllllber of dalabases - it Slmnish - English MRD, 
lhe lexicons used by ll/e KBMT engine, a large sel of 
user-generated bilingual glossaries as well as a gltzetleer 
and It list of proper and orglll/izaliOll names. The user- 
gerler.:llcd glossaries for our experiment corllained aboul 
174,000 entries. Glossary enlires conlained variahles to 
allow feature matching and indices U.i link the parts of 
phrasal elllries Ilia\[ translated Olle anolller. Fof illS\[ante, 
lhe following glossary enlry 
abso lver<l> ~t <dop:2> de 
--po::s:2> promesa  
:=> 
re lease<l> <dop:2> f rom 
<po:;s : 2- prolfli~31 ~
can help to generate such English sentences as 
I r~9\].ease yo~l froln your  p romise ;  
He re leased  me f rom my promise ;  
You w i l l  be re leas ing  her  f rom 
her p romisa  ; 
i~ t c . 
In tile rule above dop stands for"dhecl object pronoun" 
and poss for "possessive." l, fl-,les of feIflure correspon- 
dences were prepared to make the translation possible. 
Note that in many CltSCS Spanish features and English 
fealurcs were quile differenl (rlot;ih, ly, for verbs). The 
rltn,nbers in "mgtthlr brackets are indices which show the 
mo,pht+logical synthesizer which word Io put in a par- 
ticular form at generation time. In lifts expe,iment we 
used variables for the lollowing word classes: proper 
IlllllICS, such as imlividual, ct'mlplllly and ill:tee Illlllies; 
litltllllcrs itl/d the vltriotls classes of prollotlns - -  persorml, 
possessive, rellcxive, direcl ohjccl, indirecl olljecl and 
possessive al~st)hile. 
2.1. Combin ing Results 
The crux of tile B()S melhod is combining, results from 
indivhlual engines. A clmrl data strllCltlrc wil~ Itge(\] tO 
COlllbinc resells l\]t)lii Ihc individual engines. Bclbre the 
lranshffion process, the edges of lhe chart were made to 
correspond to indivkhml words in the input. New edges 
are added It) the ch:lrl tilrougtl tile operation of the throe 
MT erlgines labeled wilh tim Iransration of a scgmenI of 
tile inpul siring and indexed hy this segment's heginning 
and end positions. The KBM'I\[ and EBMT engines also 
carried a quality score for each ioulpul elemenl. 
After all lima engines finished their work il is lleC(b;- 
126 
sary lo lind the sequence of transhltion candidates vehich 
~0 cover the input string as densely as possible (so Ihat 
there is a Iraiislalion for ak I\]laI/y source lexl elements as 
possil',le); b) use the "hesl" of lhe available canditlales. 
q~'~ lind the best candidates three heuristics were used 
a) intern'd quatily ratings produced by the KP, MT and 
EBMT engines; h) stalic relative qu;dity assessmcnl of 
the protitular engines wc used and c) the length of lhe 
translation segment (the longer, Ihe hetter). Enhancing 
lhe quality of lhese hemistics antl generally tinding more 
Sol)hislicated ways of combining timlings of  individual 
engines is the most important direction of improvenlenl 
of ollr BOS system. 
The chart walk algorithm l)roducing the final result of 
lhe B()S system used lhe above heuristics. The algorilhm 
uses dynamic programming to lind the Ol~linmI cover (a 
cover with the best cnmtllative score), aSS\]lining correct 
component qualily scores. 11 ix dcscrihed in some detail 
and illustralcd in Nirenhurg and l:rcdcrking, 1994 and 
Frederking an(I Nirenburg, sttl,tfftted. 
3. The  l ) i s l )a tcher -Based  A I ) l ) roach  to 
Adapt iv i ty  
In this apfuoach, ,'t dispalcher nlodule ix used to break up 
the input text into segments and assign each segmcnl Io 
one or another o1' tile avaihtble MT engines. Among Ihc 
possible diagnoslics l~'~r the dispatcher are: 
* q~ype of translation - -  whether the rcstilt of lransht- 
lion is intended for disscmin:ttion or for assimihttitm; 
whether a complete lranslaticm is nccdetl or an ab- 
st,act or even a simple categorizalitm of a Iext (e.g., 
as a text Ihat is iml~ort;mt CllOIIgh Io be Iranshdcd in 
its entirety). 
. Availability of parallel lext iu a parlicuhu domain 
'm(I on a Imrticular topic. This ix lhe crucial cnal'fling 
condition 15r EBMT and SP, MT. 
t, Amoltnl of ambiguity in Ihc source passage, hoth 
in tile source language itself and vis-a-vis a I;irget 
language. The smaller the tlegrce of anlhilmily, Ihe 
more attractive the KBMT approach. 
.t. Size and quality of available KBMT resolnces (on- 
tology, lexicons,  etc.). 
The work on the dislmtcher, thus, includes a) evalual- 
ing tile translation contcxL with rcspccl to tile fore" crilc- 
ria above and 1"0 pulling Iogelher a decision mechanism 
which will establish the relative ,:q:,propriatcncss of each 
of tile available ngines lbr treating all input passage in a 
given context. All additionaI important parameter in Ihe 
operation of tile dispatcher is determirung the most ap- 
prol)riate size of input passage to be dispatched It) an MT 
engine. Since tin entire input text c~.tn t'~C processed hy a 
combination of MT engines, it is necessary to maximize 
tilt: cxpcclcd quality of Otllllllt OVCf ;I vark.'Ay of possil'~le 
ways of"chunking" tile input Icxl for processing. This has 
some similarity with the chart walk in file B()S alqm)ach. 
The disimtchcr will unsc an additional set of diagnostics 
dctcrlllillcd by file slntlClllre of Ihe spccitic MT engine. 
Tim dcvelt)l'llllel/I ()\[lhe:.;c dispatcher heuristics - ill (,lhcr 
words, how the dispalchcr is to be h-ained (see below) .... 
is a key l)Oinl of  tile \[l\[of~ose(I research. A prel inunary

An additional tliagnoslic heuristic lot  SBMT inspects

SRMT engine will produce \[,,ood tlualily OUtlml. 
The ahovc heuristic will also serve tile EI',MT engine. 
A heuristic uscfut spccilically for EBMT is the ~llllOtll\]t of

which will include a cOIlll)llriSOll of the rcstllts of our sys-

itions about tile texl type (where the human lagged it hy 
127 
tile module type that he considered would be needed; this 
would be essentially a difficulty rating the text a priori). 
and again a,;sessing this against system results. As the 
size of such an experiment carl be quite signilicant, we 
envisage the use of some form of qtmsi-automalie quality 
scoring for MT of the sort proposed recently by Henry 
Thompson and his colleagues (e.g., Brew and Thompson, 
1994).
