Abstract
We present BEETLE II, a tutorial dialogue sys-
tem which accepts unrestricted language in-
put and supports experimentation with differ-
ent dialogue strategies. Our first system eval-
uation compared two dialogue policies. The
resulting corpus was used to study the impact
of different tutoring and error recovery strate-
gies on user satisfaction and student interac-
tion style. It can also be used in the future to
study a wide range of research issues in dia-
logue systems.
1 Introduction
There has recently been much interest in develop-
ing tutorial dialogue systems that understand student
explanations (Graesser et al, 1999; Aleven et al,
2001; Nielsen et al, 2008; VanLehn et al, 2007),
because it has been shown that high percentages of
self-explanation and student contentful talk are cor-
related with better learning in human-human tutor-
ing (Chi et al, 1994; Litman et al, 2009). How-
ever, most existing systems use pre-authored tutor
responses for addressing student errors. The advan-
tage of this approach is that tutors can devise reme-
diation dialogues that are highly tailored to specific
misconceptions, providing step-by-step scaffolding
and potentially suggesting additional exercises. The
disadvantage is a lack of adaptivity and generality:
students often get the same remediation for the same
error regardless of their past performance or dia-
logue context. It also becomes more difficult to ex-
periment with different dialogue policies (including
error recovery and tutorial policies determining the
most appropriate feedback), due to the complexities
in applying tutoring strategies consistently in a large
number of hand-authored remediations.
The BEETLE II system architecture is designed to
overcome these limitations (Callaway et al, 2007).
It uses a deep parser and generator, together with
a domain reasoner and a diagnoser, to produce de-
tailed analyses of student utterances and to generate
feedback automatically. This allows the system to
consistently apply the same tutorial policy across a
range of questions. The system?s modular setup and
extensibility also make it a suitable testbed for both
computational linguistics algorithms and more gen-
eral questions about theories of learning.
The system is based on an introductory electric-
ity and electronics course developed by experienced
instructional designers, originally created for use in
a human-human tutoring study. The exercises were
then transferred into a computer system with only
minor adjustments (e.g., breaking down compound
questions into individual questions). This resulted
in a realistic tutoring setup, which presents interest-
ing challenges to language processing components,
involving a wide variety of language phenomena.
We demonstrate a version of the system that un-
derwent a user evaluation in 2009, which found sig-
nificant learning gains for students interacting with
the system. The experimental data collection com-
pared two different dialogue policies implemented
in the system, and resulted in a corpus supporting
research into a variety of questions about human-
computer dialogue interaction (Dzikovska et al,
2010a).

2 Example Interaction
The BEETLE II system delivers basic electricity and
electronics tutoring to students with no prior knowl-
edge of the subject. A screenshot is shown in Figure
1. The student interface includes an area to display
reading material, a circuit simulator, and a dialogue
history window. Currently all interactions with the
system are typed. Students read pre-authored cur-
riculum slides and carry out exercises which in-
volve experimenting with the circuit simulator and
explaining the observed behaviour. The system also
asks some high-level questions, such as ?What is
voltage??.
An example dialogue with the system, taken from
the evaluation corpus, is shown in Figure 2. It shows
three key system properties: after the student?s first
turn, which was correct but incomplete, the system
rephrases the correct part of the student answer and
prompts for the missing information. In the second
turn, the system cannot interpret the student utter-
ance, so it responds with a targeted help message
and a hint about the object that needs to be men-
tioned. Finally, in the last turn the system com-
bines the information from the tutor?s hint and the
student?s answers and restates the complete answer
since the current answer was completed over multi-
ple turns.
3 Data Analysis and Future Work
The data collected with the BEETLE II system has
been used to investigate several research questions
regarding discourse and dialogue: the effectiveness
of different error recovery strategies (Dzikovska et
al., 2010b); the underlying dimensions of user sat-
isfaction and their relationship with learning gain
(Dzikovska et al, 2011); the relationship between
(student) alignment in dialogue and learning gain
(Steinhauser et al, 2011); and the differences be-
tween students? social and metacognitive statements
depending on the interaction style (Dzikovska et al,
2010a). We are currently annotating the data with
additional interaction parameters, including correct-
ness of student answers and appropriateness of sys-
tem hints. This will allow us to apply PARADISE

Tutor: Why was bulb A on when switch Y
was open and switch Z was closed?
Student: because it had a closed path
Tutor: Right. There is a closed path. Keep
going.
Student: there was a closed path not effected by
the switch
Tutor: I?m sorry, I?m having a problem un-
derstanding. I don?t understand the
word ?effect? here. Here?s a hint. Your
answer should mention a battery.
Student: it has a closed path with the battery
Tutor: You?re on the right track. Here?s the
answer. Bulb A is still contained in a
closed path with the battery.

methodology to get additional insight into which pa-
rameters of tutorial dialogue affect learning gain and
user satisfaction.
We are also adding a speech interface to the sys-
tem, which will open new and interesting research
questions. Students often fail to use domain termi-
nology correctly, and in the tutoring domain it is
important to teach students to use proper terminol-
ogy, so incorrect usage must be detected and cor-
rected. This means that grammar-based language
models are not appropriate for the language mod-
elling, and opens new questions about robust ASR
and language interpretation in such domains.
