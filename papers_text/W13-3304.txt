Abstract
We present a suggestive finding regarding
the loss of associative texture in the pro-
cess of machine translation, using com-
parisons between (a) original and back-
translated texts, (b) reference and system
translations, and (c) better and worse MT
systems. We represent the amount of as-
sociation in a text using word association
profile ? a distribution of pointwise mu-
tual information between all pairs of con-
tent word types in a text. We use the av-
erage of the distribution, which we term
lexical tightness, as a single measure of
the amount of association in a text. We
show that the lexical tightness of human-
composed texts is higher than that of the
machine translated materials; human ref-
erences are tighter than machine trans-
lations, and better MT systems produce
lexically tighter translations. While the
phenomenon of the loss of associative tex-
ture has been theoretically predicted by
translation scholars, we present a measure
capable of quantifying the extent of this
phenomenon.
1 Introduction
While most current approaches to machine trans-
lation concentrate on single sentences, there is
emerging interest in phenomena that go beyond a
single sentence and pertain to the whole text being
translated. For example, Wong and Kit (2012)
demonstrated that repetition of content words is
a predictor of translation quality, with poorer
translations failing to repeat words appropriately.
Gong et al (2011) and Tiedemann (2010) present
caching of translations from earlier sections of a
document to facilitate the translation of its later
sections.
In scholarship that deals with properties of hu-
man translation of literary texts, translation is of-
ten rendered as a process that tends to deform
the original, and a number of particular aspects
of deformation have been identified. Specifically,
Berman (2000) discusses the problem of quantita-
tive impoverishment thus:
This refers to a lexical loss. Every
work in prose presents a certain pro-
liferation of signifiers and signifying
chains. Great novelist prose is ?abun-
dant.? These signifiers can be described
as unfixed, especially as a signified may
have a multiplicity of signifiers. For
the signified visage (face) Arlt employs
semblante, rosto and cara without jus-
tifying a particular choice in a particu-
lar sentence. The essential thing is that
visage is marked as an important real-
ity in his work by the use of three sig-
nifiers. The translation that does not re-
spect this multiplicity renders the ?vis-
age? of an unrecognizable work. There
is a loss, then, since the translation con-
tains fewer signifiers than the original.?1
While Berman?s remarks refer to literary trans-
lation, recent work demonstrates its relevance for
machine translation, showing that MT systems
tend to under-use linguistic devices that are com-
monly used for repeated reference, such as super-
ordinates or meronyms, although the pattern with
synonyms and near-synonyms was not clear cut
(Wong and Kit, 2012). Studying a complemen-
tary phenomenon of translation of same-lemma
lexical items in the source document into a target
language, Carpuat and Simard (2012) found that
when MT systems produce different target lan-
guage translations, they are stylistically, syntac-
tically, or semantically inadequate in most cases
1italics in the original
27
(see upper panel of Table 5 therein), that is, diver-
sifying the signifiers appropriately is a challeng-
ing task. For recent work on biasing SMT systems
towards consistent translations of repeated words,
see Ture et al (2012) and Xiao et al (2011).
Moving beyond single signifieds, or concepts,
Berman faults translations for ?the destruction of
underlying networks of signification?, whereby
groups of related words are translated without
preserving the relatedness in the target language.
While these might be unavoidable in any trans-
lation, we show below that machine translation
specifically indeed suffers from such a loss (sec-
tion 3) and that machine translation suffers from it
more than the human translations (section 4).
2 Methodology
We define WAPT ? a word association profile
of a text T ? as the distribution of PMI(x, y) for
all pairs of content2 word types (x, y) ?T.3 We es-
timate PMIs using same-paragraph co-occurrence
counts from a large and diverse corpus of about 2.5
billion words: 2 billion words come from the Gi-
gaword 2003 corpus (Graff and Cieri, 2003); an
additional 500 million words come from an in-
house corpus containing popular science and fic-
tion texts. We further define LTT ? the lexical
tightness of a text T ? as the average value of the
word association profile. All pairs of words in T
for which the corpus had no co-occurrence data
are excluded from the calculations. We note that
the database has very good coverage with respect
to the datasets in sections 3-5, with 94%-96%
of pairs on average having co-occurrence counts
in the database. A more detailed exposition of
the notion of a word association profile, includ-
ing measurements on a number of corpora, can be
found in Beigman Klebanov and Flor (2013).
Our prediction is that translated texts would be
less lexically tight than originals, and that better
translations ? either human or machine ? would be
tighter than worse translations, incurring a smaller
amount of association loss.
3 Experiment 1: Back-translation
For the experiment, we selected 20 editorials on
the topic of baseball from the New York Times
2We part-of-speech tag a text using OpenNLP tagger
(http://opennlp.apache.org) and only take into account com-
mon and proper nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
3PMI = Pointwise Mutual Information
Annotated Corpus.4 The selected articles had
baseball annotated as their sole topic, and ranged
from 250 to 750 words in length. We expect
these articles to contain a large group of words
that reflects vocabulary that is commonly used in
discussing baseball and no other systematic sub-
topics. All articles were translated into French,
Spanish, Arabic, and Swedish, and then translated
back to English, using the Google automatic trans-
lation service. Our goal is to observe the effect of
the two layers of translation (out of English and
back) on the lexical tightness of the resulting texts.
Since baseball is not a topic that is commonly
discussed in the European languages or in Ara-
bic, this is a case where culturally foreign material
needs to be rendered in a host (or target) language.
This is exactly the kind of situation where we ex-
pect deformation to occur ? the material is either
altered so that is feels more ?native? in the host
language (domestication) or its foreigness is pre-
served (foreignization) in that the material lacks
associative support in the host language (Venuti,
1995). In the first case, the translation might be
associatively adequate in the host language, but,
being altered, it would produce less culturally pre-
cise result when translated back into English. In
the second case, the result of translating out of En-
glish might already be associatively impoverished
by the standards of the host language.
The italicized phrases in the previous paragraph
underscore the theoretical and practical difficulty
in diagnozing domestication or foreignization in
translating out of English ? an associative model
for each of the host languages will be needed,
as well as some benchmark of the lexical tight-
ness of native texts written on the given topic
against which translations from English could be
judged. While the technique of back-translation
cannot identify the exact path of association loss
? through domestication or foreignization ? it can
help establish that association loss has occurred
in at least one or both of the translation processes
involved, since the original native English version
provides a natural benchmark against which the
resulting back-translations can be measured.
To make the phenomenon of association loss
more concrete, consider the following sentence:
Original Dave Magadan, the hard-hitting rookie
third baseman groomed to replace Knight,
has been hospitalized.
4LDC2008T19 in LDC catalogue
28
Arabic Dave Magadan, the stern rookie 3 base-
man groomed to replace Knight, is in the hos-
pital.5
Spanish Dave Magadan, the strong rookie third
baseman who managed to replace Knight,
has been hospitalized.
French Dave Magadan, the hitting third rookie
player prepared to replace Knight, was hos-
pitalized.
Swedish Dave Magadan, powerful rookie third
baseman groomed to replace Knight, has
been hospitalized.
Observe the translations of the phrase ?hard-
hitting rookie third baseman.? While substituting
strong and powerful for hard-hitting might seem
acceptable semantically, these terms are not asso-
ciated with the other baseball terms in the text,
whereas hitting is highly associated with them:6
Table 1 shows PMI scores for each of hitting,
stern, strong, powerful with the baseball terms
rookie and baseman. The French translation got
the hitting, but substituted the more generic term
player instead of the baseball-specific baseman.
As the bottom panel of Table 1 makes clear, while
player is associated with other baseball terms, the
associations are lower than those of baseman.
rookie baseman hitting
hitting 3.54 5.29
stern 0.35 -1.60
strong 0.54 -0.08
powerful -0.62 -0.63
player 3.95 2.73
baseman 5.11 5.29
Table 1: PMI associations of words introduced in
back-translations with baseball terms rookie, base-
man, and hitting.
Table 2 shows the average lexical tightness
values across 20 texts for the original version as
well as for the back translated versions. The origi-
nal version is statistically significantly tighter than
each of the back translated versions, using 4 ap-
plications of t-test for correlated samples, n=20,
p<0.05 in each case.
5We corrected the syntax of all back-translations while
preserving the content-word vocabulary choices.
6Our tokenizer splits words on hyphens, therefore exam-
ples are shown for hitting rather than for hard-hitting. The
point still holds, since hitting is a baseball term on its own.

4 Experiment 2: Reference vs Machine
Translation
We use a part of the dataset used in the NIST Open
MT 2008 Evaluation.7 Our set contains transla-
tions of 120 news and web articles from Arabic to
English. For each document, there are 4 human
reference translations and 17 machine translations
by various systems that participated in the bench-
mark. Table 3 shows the average and standard de-
viation of lexical tightness values across the 120
texts for each of the four reference translations,
each of the 17 MT systems, as well as an average
across the four reference translations, and an aver-
age across the 17 MT systems. Each of the 17 MT
systems is statistically significantly less tight than
the average reference human translation (17 appli-
cations of the t-test for correlated samples, n=120,
p<0.05); 12 of the 17 MT systems are statistically
significantly less tight than the least tight human
reference (reference translation #3) at p<0.05; the
average system translation is statistically signifi-
cantly less tight that the average human translation
at p<0.05.
To exemplify a large gap in associative texture
between reference and machine translations, con-
sider the following extracts.8 As the raw MT ver-
sion (MT-raw) is barely readable, we provide a
version where words are re-arranged for readabil-
ity (MT-read), preserving most of the vocabulary.
Since lexical tightness operates on content word
types, adding or removing repetitions and function
words does not impact the calculation, so we re-
moved or inserted those for the sake of readability

Ref A Dream. My sister came to tell me about a
dream she had while she slept. She was say-
ing: I saw you preparing to travel to an Arab
country, myself and a group of girlfriends.
You were sent on a scholarship abroad, and
you were preparing to travel quickly. You
were with one of the girls, who appeared to
be closer to you than the others, and I was
happy and excited because you were travel-
ing. The end. I now know !
The use of vision instead of dream, state in-
stead of country, friends instead of girlfriends,
mission instead of scholarship, raised instead of
excited, along with the complete disapperance
of slept, sister, preparing, abroad, all contribute
to a dramatic loss of associative texture in the
MT version. Highly associated pairs like dream-
slept, tell-saying, girlfriends-girls, travel-abroad,
sister-girls, happy-excited, travel-traveling are all
missed in the machine translation, while the newly
introduced word raised is quite unrelated to the
rest of the vocabulary in the extract.
5 Experiment 3: Quality of Machine
Translation
5.1 System-Level Comparison
In this experiment, we address the following ques-
tion: Is it the case that when a worse MT system A
and a better MT system B translate the same set of
materials, B tends to provide more lexically tight
translations?
To address this question, we use the Metrics-
MATR 2008 development set (Przybocki et al,
2009) from NIST Open MT 2006 evaluation.
Eight MT systems were used to translate 25 news
articles from Arabic to English, and humans pro-
vided scores for translation adequacy on a 1-7
scale. We calculated the average lexical tightness
over 25 texts for each of the eigth MT systems, as
well as the average translation score for each of the
systems. We note that human scores are available
per text segments (roughly equivalent to a sen-
tence, 249 segments in total for 25 texts), rather
than for whole texts. We first derive a human score
for the whole text for a given system by averaging
the scores of the system?s translations of the differ-
ent segments of the text. We then derive a human
score for an MT system by averaging the scores of
its translations of the 25 texts. We found that the
average adequacy score of a system is statistically
significantly positively correlated with the average
lexical tightness that the system?s translations ex-
hibit: r=0.630, n=8, df = 6, p<0.05.
30
5.2 Translation-Level Comparison
The same data could be used to answer the ques-
tion: Is it the case that better translations are
lexically tighter? Experiment 2 demonstrated that
human reference translations are tighter than ma-
chine translations; does the same relationship hold
for better vs worse machine translations? To ad-
dress this question, 25 x 8 = 200 instances of (sys-
tem, text) pairs can be used, where each has a
human score for translation adequacy and a lexi-
cal tightness value. Human scores and lexical
tightness of a translated text are significantly pos-
itively correlated, r=0.178, n=200, p<0.05. Note,
however, that this analysis is counfounded by the
variation in lexical tightness that exists between
texts: As standard deviations and ranges in Ta-
bles 2 and 3 make clear, original human texts, as
well as reference human translation for different
texts, vary in their lexical tightness. Therefore, a
lower lexical tightness value can be expected for
certain texts even for adequate translations, while
for other texts low values of lexical tightness sig-
nal a low quality translation. System-level anal-
ysis as presented in section 5.1 avoids this con-
founding, since all systems translated the same set
of texts, therefore average tightness values per sys-
tem are directly comparable.
6 Discussion and Conclusion
We presented a suggestive finding regarding the
loss of associative texture in the process of ma-
chine translation, using comparisons between (a)
original and back-translated texts, (b) reference
and system translations, (c) better and worse ma-
chine translations. We represented the amount of
association in a text using word association pro-
file ? a distribution of point wise mutual infor-
mation between all pairs of content word types
in a text. We used the average of the distribu-
tion, which we term lexical tightness ? as a sin-
gle measure of the amount of association in a text.
We showed that the lexical tightness of human-
composed texts is higher than that of the machine
translated materials. While the phenomenon of the
loss of associative texture has been theoretically
predicted by translation scholars, lexical tightness
is a computational measure capable of quantifying
the extent of this phenomenon.
Our work complements that of Wong and
Kit (2012) in demonstrating the potential utility
of discourse-level phenomena to assess machine
translations. First, we note that our findings are
orthogonal to the main finding in Wong and Kit
(2012) regarding loss of cohesion through insuffi-
cient word repetition, since our measure looks at
pairs of word types, hence disregards repetitions.
Second, the notion of pairwise word association
generalizes the notion of lexical cohesive devices
by looking not only at repeated reference with dif-
ferent lexical items or at words standing in cer-
tain semantic relations to each other, but at the
whole of the lexical network of the text. Third, dif-
ferently from the cohesion measure proposed by
Wong and Kit (2012), the lexical tightness mea-
sure does not depend on lexicographic resources
such as WordNet that do not exist in many lan-
guages.
