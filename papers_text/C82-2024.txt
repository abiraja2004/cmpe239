Th is  paper  i s  a cont inuat ion  o f  the  paper  by lh -o fessor  
I~AMSEY on the  use  o f  the  de f in i te  a r t i c le  In  Eng l i sh .  
P ro fessor  Kramsk~y found that  the  de f in i te  a r t i c le  I s  
less  used  in  newspapers  than  In  sc ient i f i c  texts ,  and i s  less  
used  In  l i te rary  texts  than  In  newspapers .  
Our analysis of English scientific texts led us ~o pro- 
pose a theory which distInguishes In sclentiflc texts two 
d i f fe rent  types  of propos i t ions :  
- those  wh lchoonvey  the  sc ient i f i c  message o f  the  
author ,  1 .e .  the  new theory  or  po ln t  o f  theory  he proposes?  
These propositions we call the language propositions In the 
text .  
- those  wh ich  are  used  to  exp la in ,  i l l us t ra te  and comment 
on the  language propos i t ions .  They he lp  the  reader  unders tand  
and approve  o f  the  author*s  new Ideas .  These we ca l l  d i scourse  
propos i t ions .  
The def in i te  a r t i c le  I s  used  An these  two types  o f  p ro -  
pos i t ions  In  s d i f fe rent  way: 
- In language propositions, the definite article intro- 
duces the terms or expressions used to designate the concepts 
operative for the analysis presented by the author. 
- In  d l scqurs~ propos i t ions ,  the  de f in i te  a r t i c le  i s  
used  to  in t roduce  the  te rms or  express ions  wh ich  des ignate  
the  examples ,  I l l us t ra t ions  wh ich  the  author  re fers  to  in  
o rder  to  exp la in  h i s  theory  to  the  reader .

F~om this analysis of the use of the definite article 
An English scientific texts, there can be devised a quasi 
automatic content analysis of a scientific text, through the 
analysis of the words introduced by the definite articles 
In the text. 
Fromthls  analysis of the use of definite articles An 
scientific texts, we proceeded to an analysis of the defin- 
Ite article in literature. 
We f i r s t  worked on V ic tory  by Joseph Conrad ,  and then  
on  the  ~ by Shakespeare .  
From this analysis, we can say that, whether the author 
of a g iven  text  be a sc ient i s t  or  a poet ,  there  is at  work a 
log ica l  p rocess  wh ich  can  be t raced  through the  use  o f  the  
de f in i te  a r t i c le .  
The prob lem o f  the  d i f fe rence  An the  number  o f  tames 
the  de f in i te  a r t i c le  i s  used  An sc ient i f i c  texts  end An l i t -  
e ra ture  As due to  the  fac t  that  the  sc ient i s t  has  to  demon- 
s t ra te  a theory, which is a purely logical process, whereas 
the poet aims at creating beauty end an J~aglnaT,y world which 
the reader must accept of. That Is why there As more emphasis 
In literature on whet we call ~ propositions than on 
what we call language propositions. 
Nevertheless t there can be traced In both types of croat- 
Ave work some similar patterns through which the human mlnd 
finds and expresses new things, which can be Illustrated by 
an analysis of the use made ~y the author of the definite 
artlcle.
