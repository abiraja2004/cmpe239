PROJECT GOALS 
Our objective is to enhance the effectiveness and 
efficiency of ad hoe and routing retrieval for large 
scale textbases. Effective retrieval means ranking 
relevant answer documents of a user's information 
need high on the output list. Our text processing and 
retrieval system PIRCS ( Probabilisitc Indexing and 
Retrieval -Components- System) handles English text 
in a domain independent fashion, and is based on a 
probabilistic model but extended with the concept of 
document components as discussed in our last year's 
site report. Our focus for enhancing effectiveness 
remains on three areas: 1) improvements ondocument 
representation; 2) combination of retrieval algorithms; 
and 3) network implementation with learning 
capabilities. Using representation with more restricted 
contexts uch as phrases or subdocument units help to 
decrease ambiguity in both retrieval and learning. 
Combining evidences from different retrieval 
algorithms is known to improve results. Viewing 
retrieval in a network helps to implement query- 
focused and document-focused r trieval and feedback, 
as well as query expansion. 
Efficiency of retrieval concerns time, space and cost 
issues of a system. These become important as the 
data one deals with grows larger and larger. Our 
focus for efficiency is to reduce time and space 
requirements in our system without sacrificing 
flexibility, robustness and our achieved retrieval 
effectiveness. 
RECENT RESULTS 
During 1993, we participated in TREC2 handling the 
full 2GB textbase provided. We redesign our system 
in two aspects: 1) on-demand network creation for 
retrieval and learning - this eliminates full 'inverted 
file' creation saving space and reducing 'dead time' 
between a collection is acquired and made searchable, 
and provides for fast learning capability; 2) 
'subeollecfions within a master' file design - this 
enables us to handle very large collections in an 
incremental nd robust fashion, yet retaining retrieval 
ranking flexibility as if all items are in one single 
large file. 
Experiments in retrieval effectiveness shows that 
query training from past known relevant documents in
a routing environment can improve average precision 
over all recall points by about 40% compared with no 
learning. Short relevant documents are the quality 
items for training; they are efficient and effective. A
ranking of the relevants and choosing the best 'n' 
appears not necessary. Breaking documents into 
subdocuments improves retrieval for lengthy items 
such as those from the Federal Registry, and 
facilitates choices of quality items for learning. Terms 
with high document frequencies are necessary for 
good representation a d performance. A choice of 
Zipf high frequency cut-off of 50,000 appears a good 
compromise between efficiency and effectiveness. Our 
item self-learning procedure to initialize edge weights 
works well as attested by our ad hoc retrieval results. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
We plan to employ 'local matching' such as sentence- 
sentence comparisons toimprove the precision of our 
retrieval. Better learning samples from the relevants 
will be explored for routing experiments. Additions to 
our two-word adjacency phrase dictionary will be 
generated from the new collections in TREC2. 
Methods to enhance ad hoe retrieval will also be 
investigated.
