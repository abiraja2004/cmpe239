Automatic lustering of languages eems to be one possible application that arose during our 
study of mathematical methods for computing dissimilarities between strings. The results of this 
experiment are discussed. 
1. Introduction 
The purpose of this paper is to show that current mathematics and computer science 
can offer expertise to various "soft" sciences, e.g., linguistics. Sixty-five languages 
are automatically grouped into clusters according to the analysis of sixteen common 
words. The authors regard the results presented in this paper merely as an example 
of a possible application of cluster analysis to linguistics. The results should not be 
regarded as conclusive but rather as suggestions to linguists that similar projects can 
be carried out on a much greater scale, hopefully yielding similar results and better 
understanding of language families. 
This is by no means the first application of mathematical methods to this problem; 
see for instance Kruskal, Dyen, and Black (1971) and Sujold~i~ et al (1987). 
2. Problem and Data 
It is more or less clear that some words are similar in certain languages and dissimilar 
in other languages. Obviously two languages are similar if most words are similar. 
Therefore the most general problem is to determine for each pair of languages how 
similar or how dissimilar they are. Is Spanish closer to Latin than English to Danish? 
In general, perhaps such quantitative questions do not always make sense. But sup- 
pose we decide to make an experiment. Suppose we decide to measure dissimilarity 
between two languages by defining it in a strict mathematical manner. From the lin- 
guistic viewpoint his may be quite absurd. Nevertheless we have defined certain ways 
to measure dissimilarity between two words and used this to measure dissimilarity 
between two languages. There are several ways one can define such a dissimilarity. In 
this paper we will show some examples. The choice of the dissimilarity will of course 
influence the outcome. It is interesting that changing the choice of the dissimilarity 
does not affect the outcome too drastically. It is for the linguists to tell whether this 
can be interpreted by saying that the results are stable, i.e., "almost independent" of
the choice of dissimilarity functions and make sense for the languages.

Let u be a word in a language L1 and let v be its translation into another 
language L2. Let d(u, v) be a dissimilarity measure or simply 
dissimilarity between the two words as it is described below. Hence 
d(u, v) is a nonnegative integer. In order to make things simpler we 
assume that both languages are written in the same alphabet. Let us give 
some examples for dissimilarity d(u, v). 
(a) Assume that dl(U, v) is the minimum number of the letters that 
have to be inserted or deleted in order to change u into v. For 
example: 
u = belly 
v = bauch. 
(b) 
Obviously in order to transform u into v we have to delete 
the letters "elly" and insert the letters "auch." Hence 
dl (belly, bauch ) = 8. 
The second possibility is the smallest number of substitutions, 
deletions, and insertions to change u into v. 
In our example: 
u = belly, v = bauch, d2(belly, bauch) = 4. 
We have to substitute the letters "elly" with letters "auch" 
and this is the shortest way to change u into v. 
Both dl(u, v) and d2(u, v) are called the Levenshtein distance 
(Kruskal 1983). 
(c) We can measure dissimilarity between two words also with the 
length of their shortest common supersequence (LSCS). Any 
"word" (string) z is a supersequence of a word u if it can be 
obtained from u by inserting letters into it. 
For example: 
if u = belly, v = bauch, then some possibilities for their shortest 
common supersequence are "bellyauch," "bealulcyh," 
"belauchly,"... They all contain 9 characters. Therefore, 
d3 (belly, bauch ) -- 9. 
There are other possibilities for defining dissimilarity d(u, v) 
that have been used in data analysis; see for instance Kashyap 
and Oommen (1983). 
In our study we have used only written languages and dialects. We used 
transliterations into standard Latin (English) alphabet. The data were 
provided from a variety of sources uch as native speakers and 
dictionaries. However, transliterations were not checked. The translations 
were not given by experts; hence it is quite likely that there are several 
inconsistencies present both in translations and in transliterations. 
Obviously the choice of a particular method of transliteration and 
translation may influence the outcome. 
The letters that do not appear in the Latin alphabet were changed 
into similar letters of the Latin alphabet. For example: in the Slovenian 
alphabet here are three nonstandard letters ~, ~, ~. We have chosen to 
omit diacritical marks: c, s, and z. A possible alternative would be to use 
ch, sh, zh. Also we omit diacritical marks in other languages. For 
instance: ~i, fi, ~ are represented as a.

3. We have chosen 16 English words. Actually, we have started with data in 
Hartigan's Clustering Algorithms, page 243. Later we used The Concise 
Dictionary of 26 Languages in Simultaneous Translation to expand the data. 
Over 30 people all over the world have given corrections and data for 
lesser known languages and dialects. The resulting data are given in 
Appendix A. 
Only linguists hould carefully select he words that would be used 
in the "real" project. We hope that they will contact us in order to carry 
out the "big" project. For some well-studied sets of words the reader 
should consult Kruskal, Dyen, and Black (1971) and Sujold~i4 et al 
(1987). 
4. The computer program for computing dissimilarity measure uses the 
data about he languages in the large array shown in Figure 1. 
There are m languages and n words in each language. We have 
selected m = 65 languages and n = 16 words. 
Note that Appendix A gives essentially this array for our experiment. 
For instance L1 = Albanian, wl~ = keq. 
5. Once we select a dissimilarity measure d(u, v) between two words, the 
next step is to define the dissimilarity D(Li, Lj) between two languages. 
There are many possibilities. We decided to take the sum of dissimilarity 
measures of words. Mathematically, it is defined as: 
. 
D(Li,  Lj) -~ d(Wil, Wjl ) q-d(wi2,wj2) -}- . . .  q-d(win,Wjn).  
We would like to point out that this is studied by data analysis; the 
reader is referred to Hartigan (1971) for further discussion and 
background. 
The next step is to select an appropriate clustering method. There are 
many different methods available (Hartigan 1971). We wanted to have 
the results expressed in the form of a binary tree (see Aho, Hopcroft, and 
Ullman 1974 for the discussion of binary trees) or more precisely in the 
form of a dendrogram; see for instance Anderberg (1973) and Gordon 
(1981). 
We selected Ward's method, which tends to give realistic results. 
This method is discussed in Anderberg (1973) and Gordon (1981).

3. Results and Comments 
The results are presented in Appendix B in the form of three dendrograms. Each 
of them corresponds to a specified dissimilarity measure. The three results are not 
identical; however, they are quite similar. 
If we cut the dendrogram horizontally at any height we obtain a partition of the set 
of the languages into a certain umber of parts that we call clusters. The dendrogram 
tells us how many clusters are suitable for data that we analyze. The number of clusters 
we obtain from the cut at the largest "jump" of two neighboring levels of the union. 
Looking at our three dendrograms we can easily notice that our data form five 
clusters: 
? Slavic 
? Germanic 
? Romance 
? Indic 
? all others. 
We can also notice that first the Slavic branch is formed. Next the Germanic and 
the Romanic languages form their groups (clusters) nearly at the same point. At the 
end the Indic languages are branching off the others. The remaining languages do not 
form any other evident cluster. See Figure 2. 
The five clusters that are formed are very stable. Any pair of languages classified 
in one of our clusters in the first dendrogram are also in the same class in the other 
two dendrograms. Notice that in some clusters languages also form subclusters. For 
example look at the Germanic languages in any dendrogram where two parts are 
very pronounced: the Scandinavian languages and the German-related languages and 
dialects. It is interesting that the simplest dissimilarity measure dl (i.e., the number of 
insertions and deletions) gives the best separation of languages.

Vladimir Batagelj et al Automatic Clustering of Languages 
We can mention that clusters we found with cluster analysis are very close to the 
language families established in linguistics (Kruskal, Dyen, and Black 1971). 
Obviously one could ask the following questions or problems that can only be 
answered by a large-scale project. 
1. In our case all treated words have equal weight. The similarity measure 
between two languages can also be defined in such a way that different 
weights (based on linguistic theory) are given to the words and/or  
transformations. 
2. How much does the choice of words influence the final tree structure? In 
our analysis English belongs to the Germanic luster, when we know 
that it also has a strong Romance component. 
3. Obviously a larger number of words would give a more accurate picture. 
The question is: how much and in what way do the results vary if we 
increase the number of words? 
4. How much would the results differ if we study spoken language instead 
of written language? We can consider for example some phonetic 
properties of written letters or strings of letters. 
5. Any choice of transliteration i troduces a "systematic error" in the 
results. One way of eliminating such an error would be to test for 
patterns and then not to penalize patterns that occur often. For example: 
if we find that "tch" ~ "zh" very often then we would not count it 
every time it occurs but only once. 
Of course for such precise analysis one needs much better knowledge of the lin- 
guistic field than we have as laypersons.
