Objective 
An understanding ofalgorithmic and engineering techniques 
for the construction fa high-quality microphone array system 
for speech input to machines is the goal of this project; it 
implicitly assumes that wearing a head-mounted microphone, 
or sitting at a fixed location in front of a table microphone is
most often an unacceptable imposition for a user of a speech 
recognizer. Rather, the array system should electronically 
track a particular talker in a small room having other talkers 
and noise sources and should provide a signal of quality 
comparable to that of the head-mounted microphone. In 
particular, the project is focused on the measurement of small- 
room acoustic properties and the derivation of underlying 
mathematical algorithms for the acoustic field, for talker 
tracking and characterization, for array layout, for correlated 
and uncorrelated noise elimination, and for beamforming. 
Simultaneously, digital array systems are being designed, 
built, and used. 
Approach 
The current approach is one in which many of the issues 
for these systems are being investigated simultaneously. We 
are using a linear (1D) array to gather eal data for both 
online and offline experimentation with beamforming, lo- 
cation, tracking, and "talker elimination" algorithms. At 
the same time, new 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays and associated 
all-digital data processors are being completed, allowing the 
facile acquisition of data from various transducers and acous- 
tic conditions. Acoustic repeatability is deemed essential to 
understanding; thus, a sound-field robot is used to automat- 
ically move transducers. Careful experimental technique is
being used to understand the properties of such systems, as 
well as develop algorithms and systems. 
Recent Accomplishments 
During the last year, the current system has been fiarther 
upgraded for more flexible conversion of existing, stored 
digital data. The properties of our high-performance output 
transducer have been measured and inverse-filter mechanisms 
now are used to acoustically reproduce a speech output 
without coloration. Automatic systems have been written to 
convert large, stored speech databases to another acoustical 
situation. For example, the array may be used to collect 
speech from a target aler and an interfering talker, both with 
known locations and output levels. New results for talker 
location are about o be published. The method works about 
95% of the time the talker is speaking, and incorporates a two- 
stage search and our Stochastic Region Contraction algorithm 
for nonlinear optimization to find the source location in real- 
time ona typical, fixed-point DSP chip. Our 128-microphone, 
all-digital system should be operational before this summer. 
The architecture is both simple and elegant and there is 
some interest in it on the part of NUWC for ultrasonic data 
acquisition. This system allows the formation of up to 
128 total microphones in virtually any spatial arrangement. 
This array should allow for very flexible experimentation 
with spatial filtering of all sorts. A recent experiment has 
set a baseline for the performance of our speech recognizer 
relative to its close-talking performance. A 12% performance 
degradation resulted from using a simple beamformer system 
with no noise compensation asinput o the recognizer. Now, 
all new algorithms can be quantitatively tested for effect. 
Plans for the Coming Interval 
Continue the modeling of the properties of the room, 
transducers, and electronics, so that effective "decon- 
volving" algorithms may be designed. 
Finish the 128-microphone system and apply it in many 
spatial variants to the problem of filtering out reverbera- 
tions. 
Continue the development of better algorithms for loca- 
tion, tracking, beamforming, and talker elimination. 
Incorporate noise-reduction mechanisms into the current 
real-time array for cleaning the signal for recognition. 
Compare these results to the current baseline. 
Continue to use and gain understanding of the SRC 
nonlinear minimization algorithm.
