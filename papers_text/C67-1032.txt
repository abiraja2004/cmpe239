Statistical and Linguistic Strategies in the 
Computer Grading:of Essays

Essay tests are used in the schools and colleges of 
all nations, and in major testing programs of national 
and eveh international size. Potentially, such essay 
tests are an important applied field for computational 
linguistics, and.should eventually provide focus for 
much work. Yet in the past, little direct attention has 
been paid to such grading, although there are ways to 
begin investigation which would not necessarily require 
much linguistic knowledge beyond that now available. 
Beginning in December of 1964, Project Essay Grade 
(PEG), at the University of Connecticut, has investi- 
gated the c0mpute~lanalysis and evaluation of student 
writing. In February, 1965, the project was given 
pilot funding by the College Entrance Examination 
Board of New York City, and in June, 1966, the United 
3tares Office of Education gave it much larger ~upport. 
Zhrough this period of preliminary investigation, icer- 
tainproblems have become much better understood 
(Daigon, 1966; Page, 1966, 1967). ~his paper discusses 
these problems, relates certain major findings to date, 
and outlines apparently promising avenues for future 
work by linguists, computer scientists, psychologists, 
and educators. 
Background 
It'is useful to conceptualize the field of essay 
grading in two dimensions, as represented in Figure 1;

Analysis 
Any serious effort to grade essays must obviously 
face problems of "content" as in Column I, and of "style" 
as in Column II. Yet it is obvious that these columns 
are not mutually exclusive. Similarly, the  rows are not 
mutually exclusive either; but their general meaning 
must be mastered to understand the work to date and the ~ 
problems of the field. The first row refers to the 
simulation of the human judgment, without great concern 
about the way this judgment was produced. The second 
row refers to the accurate, deep, "true" analysis of 
the essay. 
We have coined two terms to describe this differ- 
ence. Since the top row is concerned with approximation, 
we speak of the computer-variables employed as ~ .  
Since the bottom row is concerned with the true intrin- 
sic" variables of interest, we speak of such var iab l -~  
as trins. A trin, then, is a variable of intrinsic 
interest to the human judge, for example, "aptness of 
word choice". Usually a trin is not directly measurable 
by present computer strategies. And a prox is any 
var iab le  measured by the computer, as an approximation 
(or correlate) of some trin, for example, proportion of 
uncommon words used by a student (where common words are 
discovered by a list look-up procedure in computer 
memory). 
In the early par? of our investigations, we concen- 
trated on the right column and top row of Figure i, look- 
ing for actuarial strategies, seeking out those proxes 
which would be of most immediate use in the simulation 
of the final human product, the ratings of stylistic 
factors. 
For the first attempts, we evolved a general research 
design, which we have more or less followed to date: 
(i) Samples of essays were judged by a number of 
independent experts. For our first trial 272 essays ,  
written by students in Grades 8 to 12 in an American 
high school, and judged by at least four independent 
teachers. These judgments of overall quality formed the 
trins. 
(2) Hypotheses were generated about the variables 
which might be associated with these judgments. If 
measurable by computer, and feasible to program within 
the logistics of the study, these computer variables be- 
came the proxes of the study. 
(3) Computer routines were written to measure these 
proxes in the essays. These were written in FJORTRAN IV, 
for the IBM 7040 computer, and are highly modular and 
mnemonic programs, fairly well documented and available 
to computational linguists interested in using them or 
adapting them. 
(4) Essays were prepared for computer input. In 
the present stage of data processing, this means that 
they were typed by clerical workers on an ordinary key- 
punch. They were punched into cards, and these cards 
served as input for the next stage. 
(5) The essays were passed through the computer, 
under the control of the program which collected data 
about the proxes. The output was as appears in Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows a piece of output from PEG-IA. Line 
A shows the way a sentence from the student essay is re- 
written in 12-character double-precision computer "words" 
and stored in memory. Line B shows the summary of data 
for that sentence just analyzed. The first number is 
the essay identification. The other numbers of Line B 
are some counts from that sentence. Line C shows a 
summary of these counts, across sentences, for this whole 
essay. And Line D are these measures transformed in a 
number of simple ways, and ready for input into the f ina l  
analysis. 
(6) These scores were then analyzed for their mul- 
tivariate relationship to the human ratings, were weighted 
appropriately, and were used to maximize the prediction 
of the expert human ratings. This was all done by use of 
standard mult iple-regression programs. 
The first analyses produced results as shown in 
Table i. Here it is possible to read the list of proxes 
(Col. A), "and their correlation, after transformation, 
with the human judgments of overall quality (Col. B). 
Col. C shows their contribution to the total multiple 
regression, and Col. D indicates the test-retest relia- 
bil ity of the proxes themselves, as discovered from two 
essays written by the same students, with about a month 
between writings.

The overall accuracy of this beginning strategy was 
startling. The proxes achieved a mult iple-correlat ion of 
.71 for the first set of essays analyzed and, by chance, 
achieved the identical coefficient for the second Set. 
Furthermore, the beta weightings from one set of essays 
did well in predicting the human judgments for the second 
set of  essays written by the same youngsters. All in all, 
the computer did a respectable, "human-expert" job in 
grading essays, as is visible in Table 2.

Here we see the results of a cross-validation. 
These are correlations between judgments of 138 essays 
done by five "judges," four of them human and one of 
them the computer. The computer judgments were the 
grades given by the regression weightings based on 138 
other essays by other students. This cross-validation, 
then,  is very conservative. Yet, from a practical 
point of view, the five judges are indistinguishable 
from one another. 
However useful such an overall rat ing m&ght be, 
we of course still wished greater detail in our analysis. 
We therefore broadened the ana lys i s - - -~ ive  traits be- 
lieved important in essays, adapted partly from those 
of Paul Diederich. They may be summarized as: ideas, 
organization, st__~, mechanics, and creativity. We 
had a partfcular interest in creativity, since some ? 
critics from the beginning have believed that the com- 
puter must founder on this kind of measure. "YOU migh t 
gra~e mechanics all right," someone will say, "but what 
about originality? What about the fellow who is really 
different? The machine can't handle him~" 
Therefore, in 1966 we called together a group of 
32 highly qualif ied Eng l i shteachers  from the schools 
of Connecticut to see how they would handle creativity 
and these other traits. Each of 256 essays wes rated 
on a five-point scale on each of these five important 
traits, by eight such expert judges, each acting inde- 
pendently of any other judge. The teacher ratings were 
then analyzed, and it was found that the essay and the 
trait contributed significant variances, as did the 
trait-by-essay interaction, (perhaps the clearest demon-  
stration'of the ipsative profile). To investigate each 
o f  these five trait ratings, the same 30 proxes were 
again employed, with the results to be seen in Table 3.

Note: 
Coi. B represents the reliabil ity of the human judg-

Col. C represents the mult iple-regression coeffi- 
cients found in predicting the pooled human ratings 
with 30 independent proxes found in the essays by the 
computer  program of PEG-IA. 
Col. D presents these same coefficients, shrunken 
to eliminate capitalization on chance from the number 
of predictor variables (cf. McNemar, 1962, p. 184~ 
Col. E presents these coefficients, both shrunken 
and corrected for the unreliabil ity of the human groups 
(cf. McNemar, 1962, p. 153.) 
In our rapidly growing knowledge, Table 3 may 
temporarily say the most to us about the computer anal- 
ysis of important essay traits. Column A of course 
gives the titles of the five traits (more complete 
descriptions of the rating instructions may be supplied 
on request). Column B shows the rather low rel iabil ity 
of the group of eight human judges, computed by anal- 
ysis of variance. 
Here in Column B "creativity" is less reliably 
judged by these experts than are the other traits, 
even when eight judgments are pooled. And mechanics 
may be the most reliably graded of these five traits. 
Surely, then, humans seemed to have a harder time 
with c reat iv i t~wi th  mechanics. 
What of the computer? Column C shows the\[raw 
multiple correlations of the proxes with these rather 
unre l iab le  group judgments. These were the coeffi- 
cients produced by the standard regression program run 
by Dieter Paulus and myself. Column D simply shows 
the same coefficients after the necessary shrinking to ? 
avoid the Capitalization on chance which is inherent 
with multiple predictors. Finally, in order for a 
fair comparison to be made among the traits, the 
criterion's unreliabil ity should be taken into account, 
as in Column E. Here such difficult variables as 
creativity and organization no longer seem to suffer; 
the computer's difficulty is apparently in the criter- 
ion itself, and is therefore attributable to human 
limitations, rather than to machine or program limita- 
tions. Column E, then, exhibits what might be the 
expectable cross-validation from a similar set of 
essays, if predicting a perfectly reliable set of human 
judgments. 
Current and Projected Problems 
Of course, all this is a temporary reading taken 
in the middle of the research s t ream.  Our investigators 
have also gone on Withjother strategies. Donald Mar- 
cotte (1967) has developed a phrase analyzer, and has 
discovered that cliches, as usually listed, were largely 
irrelevant to the judgment of such essays. Dieter 
Paulus (1967a) has studied the Curvil inearity of proxes, 
and concluded that much elaborate statistical optimiza- 
tion may be a?waste of time; and that the most major 
improvements should probab lybe  made in other ways. He 
also has studied feedback to the student writer, using 
an on-line time-sharing console (Paulus, 1967b), as 
has also Michael Zieky. Another researcher, Jack H. 
Hiller (1967), has investigated quasi-psychological 
dimensions (including opinionation and vagueness)as 
predictors of the human judgments. Using techniques 
familiar from automatic content analysis (cf. Stone et al 
1966), he constructed lists of words and ph-{ases to ~-6 - ?-  
fine the variables of psychological interest, and found 
these negatively correlated, as he predicted, with writ- 
ing quality. And, in May, 1967, a sizeable improvement 
was made in the statistical accuracy, increasing the 
multiple-regression coefficient from about .71 to about 
.77, and improving the variance accounted for by around 
20%. In other words, the newest programs apparently do 
better than the indiyidual, expert English teacher. 
The early strategies, then, have provided fertile 
ground for statistical investigation of essay grading, 
especially in the actuarial simulation of rating of 
style. But what of the deeper dimensions of stylistic 
analysis, and what of subject-matter ?content, as in 
essay questions in history, philosophy, or science? 
7 
Possible contributory linguistic strategies have 
been under more intensive study in recent months, with 
the advice and help of Susumu Kuno (1964), Stanley 
Petrick (Keyser and Petrick, 1967), John Olney (Olney 
and Londe, 1966; also see Harris, 1952) and others. 
(Of course these workers are not resppnsible for errors 
or misconceptions in the present paper.) Anticipated 
f~ture strategies are currently summarized in Table 4. 
This table is based partly on work already accomplished 
in Project Essay Grade, partly on suggested minor 
adaptations of systems already working for others, and 
partly on projected programs which are not yet appar- 
ently operative in any system, but which do not seem 
impossibly difficult at the efficiency desired.

INPUT and PUNCH. Handwritten or typewritten or 
other raw response of the writer is converted 
for computer input. 
SNTORG. Creates arrays of words and sentences as 
found in prose. This is just as performed in 
PEG-I. 
DICT. Assignment of available syntactic roles to 
each word. This is currently done by many pro- 
grams, but needs an expanded dictionary, and 
ambiguity resolver.' At the same time, the 
semantic information will be stored in the work- 
space for reference of other parts of program. 
Availabil ity of the tape-written Random House 
Dictionary (Unabridged) has been promised. 
PARS. A modified Kuno (1964) program seems most 
promising, and is currently being programmed for 
both the 7094 and the 360 by workers at IBM. 
Alterations will be hecessary to accep? welln 
formed substrings.: 
REFER. This is intended to identify and encode the 
most likely referents of pronouns and other 
anaphoric expressions. (Cf. Olney and Londe, 
1966). This process must employ both syntactic 
features and semantic information from DICT.

Table 4 (Continued) 
6.  KERNEL and STRUC. From the rewritten string output 
of (5), KERNEL would establish a set  of elemen- 
tary propositfons, and STRUC would encode the 
relationships among these elements. This step 
would retain all the information of an essay in 
simplest possible units, yet would retain addi- 
tional information about emphasis, subordination, 
causal relation, etc., among these units. 
. 
i0. 
7 .  EQUIV. The elementary units would be augmented b.y 
the semantic information in DICT. To each word 
would be assigned a cluster of permissible 
synonyms, with weightings of semantic distance. 
This permits an analysis of redundance and 
emphasis in the essay, and permits a comparison 
of the content of the student essay with that of 
the key or master essay. 
8. STYLE. Descriptions of the surface structure char- 
acteristics of the essay~ parts of speech, 
organization of themes, types and varieties of 
sentence structure, grammatical dePths, tightness 
of reference, etc~ information about grammatical 
errors and strengths. 
CONTNT. Comparison of the agreement of student and 
master essay, through measure of kernel hits and 
struc hits, these weighted by semantic distance 
of~language chosen. 
J 
SCOR.  Multivariate prediction of appropriate pro- 
f i le for the immediate purpose .  
The limitations of space will permit only a few 
comments on this table, which may be seen as representing 
a hypothetical, ideal essay grader. For large grading 
systems, over established substantive content, it would 
be possible, for the key or master ~ ,  to edit by hand 
the output fro--m-ce--~ain ro-utln~s(especlally REFER and 
STRUC). Of course, four of the most important routines 
listed in Table 4 are far from perfected in any existing 
programs. Ideally, they would assume better solutions to 
certain major, stubborn problems in computational linguis- 
tics. 
? 
Indeed, the steps in this hypothetical essay 
grader are close to the heart of the most persistent 
and  troublesome problems in linguistics. Is it 
necessary that sentences be syntactically analyzed 
before mapping into deep structure? What is the proper 
role of semantics in such deep structure? How can the 
outside knowledge of the reader be incorporated into 
the machine analysis? (For some discussion of this pro- 
blem, see Quillian, 1966). In general, how may we in- 
corporate some of the intuitive richness which the 
literate hu~lan brings to his reading? 
It is not expected that workers in essay grading 
will suddenly resolve all such questions. They may be 
recognized as those which so trouble linguists as to 
contribute to the recent official pessimism, in the 
United States, about the future of mechanical transla- 
tion. After 15 years of effort, mechanical translation 
is still regarded as disappointing in quality, and vir- 
tually no sustained output of any machine program would 
be ordinarily mistaken for the work of a professional 
human t rans la tor .  
On the other hand, the earliest attempts at essay 
grading by computer have, in a very limited way, leaped 
ahead of machine translation. And if the expert human 
ratings of high school essays may be regarded as an 
acceptable goal, then the machine program appears to  
have reached such a goal already. For that matter, 
improved performance, even superior to that of the in- 
dividual human expert, appears to be immediately practi- 
cable as well. 
The explanation of this advantage, of course, is 
that the-problem of essay grading as attacked in the 
current work is much easier than the problem of machine 
translation. In translation, every nuance of the input 
s t r ingshou ld  be accounted for in the output string. 
In essay grading, only-a certain portion of the input 
text needs to be accounted for, and the output .doesnot  
depend on the existence of any large,language-generating 
system. High quality machine translation apparently de- 
mands a fair portion of the total language-manipulating 
capability of the human, but essay grading may use only 
a fraction of it, and may process language in ways quite 
different from that of the human being. For example, our 
present programs have to date largely ignored order and 
sequence in the essays, although to the human th--~rder 
of words is, of course , of crucial and unceasing import- 
ance. 
Since essay grading can work with such fractional 
information, then, why pursue the deeper analysis of 
Table 4? Clearly, the purpose is not entirely the same 
as it would be for the usual linguist. At any d iscrete 
i0 
time in research, what is sought is not necessarily the 
perfect humanoid behavior, but rather those portions of 
that  behavior which, given any current state of the art, 
will contribute optimally to efficient and practicable 
improvements in output. Indeed, regardless of the 
eventual perfection of deep linguistic behavior, for any 
specific application to essay grading, at any one moment, 
large portions of such available behavior may be irrele- 
vant, just as it seems that ordinary human language 
processing does not usually call for our full l inguistic 
effort. 
Yetwe regard it as eventually important to be 
~ble to perform these various kinds of advanced machine 
analysis when required. Therefore, the eventual uses 
of the ideal essay analyzer may require analytic capa- 
bility as deep as may be imagined. Writing out suitable 
comments for the student, for example, will in some 
cases~ tax any system which may be foreseen. 
Even approximate solutions to these problems, how- 
ever, though unsatisfactory for certain scientific pur- 
poses,  could make important contributions to the educa- 
tional description and evaluation of essays. For such 
evaluation is itself probabilistic, l imited by imperfect 
asymptotes of writer consistency and rater agreement. 
And such evaluation therefore does not require, to be 
practicable and satisfactory, the same deterministic 
perfection which has continued to elude and frustrate 
researchers ~ mechanical translation. ~ There is a fund, 
amental difference in goals, which must be realized. As 
has been demonstrated here, the output from much cruder 
statistical programs has already reached a quality not 
too remote from usefulness. The more advanced strate- 
gies currently seem, at least to the present workers, 
bright with promise,
