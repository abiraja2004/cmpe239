There are hardly any an_notation schemes including semantic information, with the exception of Princeton 
WordNet (which will be extended by EuroWordNet for European languages). But some projects already 
addressed this topic, like FraCaS (Framework for Computational Semantics), or are starting to do this, like 
DIET (Diagnostic and Evaluation Tools for NL Applications, an extension of the TSNLP framework, see 
Lehmann et al, Coling 96) 1. 
What makes semantic tagging appealing is, among others, the (justified) hope that it will contribute to 
the improvement of the performances and the robustness of NLP systems. Besides this aspect, evaluation 
will also benefit from semantically tagged test corpora. 
In this working session, we focus on both the question how semantic tagging can support he development 
of NLP applications and, the other way round, how NLP systems can support semantic tagging. Among the 
different NLP projects making a (limited) use of semantic annotations, we are aiming at common annotation 
methodologies beyond particular approaches. 
As an example we describe a scenario which has been adopted within the context of a NLP project con- 
cerned with appointment sched~lling (COSMA, see Bnsem~_nn etal., ANLP 97), where information extraction 
techniques combined with a shallow-parsing strategy (see Neumann, ANLP 97) have been used in order to 
process just the relevant fragments of input texts. 
To support the development of the system and to delimit the linguistic coverage of the NLP  application, a 
small corpus has been semantically hand-tagged, where the semantic annotations have been added to the 
mainly syntactic annotation scheme of the TSNLP  framework. Thus the evaluation tool of TSNLP  has been 
extended by a certain class of semantic information (non-ambiguous temporal expressions). Furthermore the 
FST  automata developed for the purpose of messag e extraction have been designed along the lines of this 
annotation scheme. And the output of the FST automata has been defined in such a way that they can be 
used for an automatic (rule-based) semantic annotation of new text input (the annotation being limited to 
the temporal expression). 
Other NLP  applications could reuse such a simple annotation in order to determlne, for example, selectional 
restrictions or text classifications. Addressing the reusability of annotation schemes for particular domains, 
one will have to consider if they can be just added to existing morpho-syntactic annotation schemes, as we 
described in the example above, or if the annotation work should be started from scratch, which could be 
necessary for more complex applications. A recently developed annotation scheme (see Skut et al, ANLP  97) 
is proposing an architecture with multiple levels of linguistic representation, for argument structure, gram- 
matical function and syntactic category. We will investigate how semantic information can be integrated in 
such a framework and if the bidirectional interface between semantic tagging and NLP  system, described 
above, can be adopted to this architecture.
