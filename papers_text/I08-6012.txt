Abstract 
 
This paper describes our first participation in the Indian language sub-task of 
the main Adhoc monolingual and bilingual track in CLEF competition. In 
this track, the task is to retrieve relevant documents from an English corpus 
in response to a query expressed in different Indian languages including 
Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi. Groups participating in this 
track are required to submit a English to English monolingual run and a 
Hindi to English bilingual run with optional runs in rest of the languages. 
We had submitted a monolingual English run and a Hindi to English cross-
lingual run. 
 
We used a word alignment table that was learnt by a Statistical Machine 
Translation (SMT) system trained on aligned parallel sentences, to map a 
query in source language into an equivalent query in the language of the 
target document collection. The relevant documents are then retrieved using 
a Language Modeling based retrieval algorithm. On CLEF 2007 data set, our 
official cross-lingual performance was 54.4% of the monolingual 
performance and in the post submission experiments we found that it can be 
significantly improved up to 73.4%.
