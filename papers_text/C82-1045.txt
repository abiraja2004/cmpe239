Practical machine translation must be considered from a 
heuristic point of view rather than from a purely rigid analytical 
linguistic method. An English-into-Japanese translation system 
named ATHENE based on a Heuristic Parsing Model (HPM) has been 
developed. The experiment shows some advantageous points such 
as simplification of transforming and generating phase, semi- 
localization of multiple meaning resolution, and extendability 
for future grammatical refinement. HPM-base parsing process, 
parsed tree, grammatical data representation, and translation 
results are also described. 
\]. INTRODUCTION 
Is i t  true that the recipe to realize a successful machine translation is in 
precise and rigid language parsing? So far many studies have been done on rigid 
and detailed natural language parsing, some of which are so powerful as to detect 
some ungrammatical sentences If ,  2, 3, 4\]. Notwithstanding i t seems that the 
detailed parsing is not always connected with practically satisfying machine 
translations. On the other hand actual human, even foreign language learners, can 
translate fair ly di f f icult  English sentences without going into details of parsing. 
They only use an elementary grammatical knowledge and dictionaries. 
Thu. we have paid attention on the heuristic methods of language-learners and have 
dew~ed a rather non-standard linguistic model named HPM (= Heuristic Parsing 
Model). Here, "non-standard" implies that sentential constituents in HPM are 
different from those in widely accepted modern English grammars \[5\] or in phrase 
structure grammars \[6\]. In order to prove the reasonability of HPM, we have 
developed an English-into-Japanese translation system named ATHENE (= Automatic 
T_ranslation of Hitachi from E_nglish into Nihongo with Editing Support)~f. Fig. I). 
The essential features of heuristic translation are summarized as in following 
three points. 
(I) To segment an input sentence into new elements named Phrasal Elements (PE) 
and Clausal Elements (CE), 
(2) To assign syntactic roles to PE's and CE's, and restructure the segmented 
elements into tree-forms by inclusive relation and into list-forms by modify- 
ing relation. 
(3) To permute the segmented elements, and to assiqn appropriate Japanese equiva- 
lents with necessary case suffixes and postpos~tions. 
The next section presents an overview of HPM, which is followed in Sec. 3 by a 
rough explication of machine translation process in ATHENE. Sec. 4 discusses the 
experimental results. Sec. 5 presents cohcluding remarks and current plans for

Fig. 3 Intermediate Parsed Tree on HPM (Part 2: from "PE" to Sentence) 
2.1 Parsed Tree: A parsed sentence is represented in a "tree" or " l ist"  of nodes 
linked by pointers. Each node corresponds to a certain "constituent of 
sentence". "Tree (~/)" is for inclusive relation, and " l i s t  ( '~)"  is for 
modifying relation. 
2.2 Constituent: Constituents of sentence is classified into five elements uch 
as: Word Element, Phrasal Element, Clausal Element, Delimiting Element, and 
Sentence. And these elements have two values: Attribute and Syntactic Role. 
2.3 Word Element (WE)~ WE is the smallest consti'tuent, and therefore is an in- 
separable element in HPM. 
2.4 Phrasal Element (PE): PE is composed of one or more WE('s) which carries a 
part of sentential meaning in the smallest possible form. PE's are mutually 
exclusive. Typical examples are: "his very ski l l ful  technique (N)", "would 
not have been doen (V)", and "for everyday production use (PNAL)". 
2.5 Clausal Element (CE): CE is composed of one or more PE('s) which carries a 
part of sentential meaning in a nexus-like form. CE is nearly corresponding 
to a Japanese simple sentence such as:"'v{wa/ga/wo/no}~,{suru/dearu} \[koto\]~' 
CE's allow mutual intersection. Typical examples are the underlined parts in 
the following: " I t  is important for you to do so." 
2.L Sentence (SE): SE is composed of one or more CE('s) and is located at the 
bottom of a parsed tree. 
2.7 Dependency Pattern of Verb: Verb-dependency-type code is deten~ined by 
simplifying Hornby's classification\[ 7\], as i

2.8 Sub-Attribute of Noun: Noun is classified from somewhat semantical viewpoints 
(cf. Table 2). 
2.9 Syntactic Role (SR): SR is important o represent parsing results and to 
generate Japanese sentences. For example, the sequencWof SR such as "SUBJ + 
GOV + OBJ" wi l l  readily imply the Japanese sentence such as "SUBJ + {ga/wa/ 
no} + OBJ + {wo/ni} + GOV". This implication may be quite natural for 
language-learners.

3. TRANSLATION PROCESS 
From the viewpoint of simplicity and maintenability, i t might be desirable to des- 
cribe all the Grammatical Data (GD) in static pattern form. But unfortunately, 
the pattern form description is lacking in the f lex ib i l i ty  to change control 
structures. Thus we have adopted a combination of "program" and "pattern" to 
describe GD. 
In the followings, we will describe the translation process along with the ex- 
amples of grara~atical data (GD) to be referred. The essential point of the trans- 
lation process is "to replace some specified node pattern sequences with others, 
under the appropriate control with grammatical data". This replacement process is 
composed of following twelve steps: 
(I) Text Input: To produce upper-most node sequence in the parsed tree. 
(2) Morphological Resolution: To reduce the inflected word to root form. 
(3) Lexicon Retrieval and Attribute Assignment: To assign all  possible attributes 
to "WE's". 
(4) Ambiguity Resolution in Attributes: To select most l ikely one from among 
many possibi)ities. 
(5) Segmentation i to "PE's" and Attribute Assignment: To make a PE from matched 
WE group and give attribute(s). 
(6) Re-retrieval of Lexicon: To find again possible WE or PE, especially for 
? I I  "the separated PE" such as " take , in to  consideratlon .
(7) Syntactic Role Assignment to PE's: To determine Syntactic Role of PE's by 
referring a pattern GD as in Fig. 4.

4. EXPERIi4ENTAL RESULTS 
A pro~pe machine translation system from English in~ Japanese named ATHENE, as 
is sketched in Fig. l ,  has been implemented. The lexicons contain nearly.ten 
thousand words, not counting idioms and other multi-word groups, which are mainly 
composed of educational basic words (up to senior-high-school-level in Japan) and 
of about a thousand computer terminologies. Our system has translated a series of 
t t passages extracted randomly from English readers of senior high school and 
c~ outer system journals. 
The results of the tests are encouraging on the whole. The system can trans- 
late fair ly complicated sen~nces when equiped with the adequate gram~tical data 
and idiomatic phrases. Output sen~nces, even though far from eloquent style, are 
worth post-editing, and can be considerably improved with multiple meaning 
correction through interactive work. Some interesting technical findings are the 
following: 
(1) The ~llowing items are sometimes yntactically ambiguous to the system. 
(i) ING + N (ambiguity among ADJ + SUBJ/OBJ, GOV + OBJ, and ~e like). 
( i i )  To-infinitives (ambigui~ be~een adjective and adverbial). 
( i i i )  Linking scope ambigui~ w.r.t .  "and", "or", "of" (A and B of C for D). 
(iv) Embedded appositional phrases. 
(2) Very long PE's (Phrasal Elements) appear occasionally. (eg. the PE node 
numbered 52 in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). 
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this paper we t~ to contend that machine translation should be studied from 
more heuristic side, or from actual language-learner's methodology side rather 
than from purely rigid liguistical analysis side. Researchers of ve~ "high level" 
linguistic analysis side, as is poin~d out by Boitet \[8\], "seem too often to con- 
centrate on in,rest ing high level phenomena s anaphoric re~rence, discourse 
288 I Y. NITTA et al 
structure, causality and reasoning and to forget at the same time persisting and 
very frequent lower-level difficulties . . . .  " This "frequent lower-level d i f f i -  
culty" is the very problem to be solved in practical machine translation, and is 
actually solved easily by naive foreign language learners only with the help of 
elementary grammatical knowledge. You had better recall that language-learners 
must solve the whole even though i t  is incomplete, on the other hand, pure 
linguists must solve completely even though i t  is very limited. 
In the light of this contention, we have devised a heuristic parsing model named 
HPM to accommodate he machine translation to the actual human translation 
methodologies, and at the same time, on HPM we have constructed a machine trans- 
lation system named ATHENE. Experimental translation by ATHNE shows the follow- 
ing advantageous points of our heuristic approach. 
(1) Contribution to the f lex ib i l i ty ,  simplicity and maintenability in grammatical 
description. 
(2) Contribution to the simplicity and transparency in transforming phase and 
generating phase. 
One of further problems is to extend the grammatical data heuristically, so as to 
intensify our machine translation system from learner's level to expert's level. 
Though our system can translate fair ly complex sentences, i t  s t i l l  commits learn- 
er's level errors when encountering difficulties such as ambiguity of preposi- 
tional group modification or of word linking scope for conjunction. Heuristic 
aspects of semantics are also our current interests of research. Especially the 
case-grammetical idea \[9\] seems to be useful to refine our syntactic-role assign- 
ment process so as to improve the quality of generated Japanese sentences. A 
kind of semantic ode system (or thesaurus) will also be required to be introduced 
in our lexicons. Space limitation of this proceeding does not allow us to des- 
cribe Our linguistic model: HPM in detail. We are planning to present he more 
detailed version of HPM together with later improvement in some appropriate 
journals.
