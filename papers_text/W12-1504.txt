Abstract
Commonly, the result of referring expression
generation algorithms is a single noun phrase.
In interactive settings with a shared workspace,
however, human dialog partners often split re-
ferring expressions into installments that adapt
to changes in the context and to actions of their
partners. We present a corpus of human?human
interactions in the GIVE-2 setting in which in-
structions are spoken. A first study of object
descriptions in this corpus shows that refer-
ences in installments are quite common in this
scenario and suggests that contextual factors
partly determine their use. We discuss what
new challenges this creates for NLG systems.
1 Introduction
Referring expression generation is classically consid-
ered to be the problem of producing a single noun
phrase that uniquely identifies a referent (Krahmer
and van Deemter, 2012). This approach is well suited
for non-interactive, static contexts, but recently, there
has been increased interest in generation for situated
dialog (Stoia, 2007; Striegnitz et al, 2011).
Most human language use takes place in dynamic
situations, and psycholinguistic research on human?
human dialog has proposed that the production of
referring expressions should rather be seen as a pro-
cess that not only depends on the context and the
choices of the speaker, but also on the reactions of
the addressee. Thus the result is often not a single
noun phrase but a sequence of installments (Clark
and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), consisting of multiple utter-
ances which may be interleaved with feedback from
the addressee. In a setting where the dialog partners
have access to a common workspace, they, further-
more, carefully monitor each other?s non-linugistic
actions, which often replace verbal feedback (Clark
and Krych, 2004; Gergle et al, 2004). The following
example from our data illustrates this. A is instructing
B to press a particular button.
(1) A: the blue button
B: [moves and then hesitates]
A: the one you see on your right
B: [starts moving again]
A: press that one
While computational models of this behavior are still
scarce, some first steps have been taken. Stoia (2007)
studies instruction giving in a virtual environment
and finds that references to target objects are often
not made when they first become visible. Instead in-
teraction partners are navigated to a spot from where
an easier description is possible. Garoufi and Koller
(2010) develop a planning-based approach of this be-
havior. But once their system decides to generate a
referring expression, it is delivered in one unit.
Thompson (2009), on the other hand, proposes a
game-theoretic model to predict how noun phrases
are split up into installments. While Thompson did
not specify how the necessary parameters to calculate
the utility of an utterance are derived from the context
and did not implement the model, it provides a good
theoretical basis for an implementation.
The GIVE Challenge is a recent shared task on sit-
uated generation (Striegnitz et al, 2011). In the GIVE
scenario a human user goes on a treasure hunt in a
virtual environment. He or she has to press a series of
buttons that unlock doors and open a safe. The chal-
lenge for the NLG systems is to generate instructions
in real-time to guide the user to the goal. The instruc-
tions are presented to the user as written text, which
12
means that there is less opportunity for interleaving
language and actions than with spoken instructions.
While some systems generate sentence fragments in
certain situations (e.g., not this one when the user
is moving towards the wrong button), instructions
are generally produced as complete sentences and
replaced with a new full sentence when the context
changes (a strategy which would not work for spoken
instructions). Nevertheless, timing issues are a cause
for errors that is cited by several teams who devel-
oped systems for the GIVE challenge, and generating
appropriate feedback has been an important concern
for almost all teams (see the system descriptions in
(Belz et al, 2011)). Unfortunately, no systematic er-
ror analysis has been done for the interactions from
the GIVE challenges. Anecdotally, however, not re-
acting to signs of confusion in the user?s actions at
all or reacting too late seem to be common causes for
problems. Furthermore, we have found that the strat-
egy of replacing instructions with complete sentences
to account for a change in context can lead to con-
fusion because it seems unclear to the user whether
this new instruction is a correction or an elaboration.
In this paper we report on a study of the com-
municative behavior of human dyads in the GIVE
environment where instead of written text instruction
givers use unrestricted spoken language to direct in-
struction followers through the world. We find that
often multiple installments are used to identify a ref-
erent and that the instruction givers are highly respon-
sive to context changes and the instruction followers?
actions. Our goal is to inform the development of a
generation system that generates object descriptions
in installments while taking into account the actions
of its interaction partner.
2 A corpus of spoken instructions in a
virtual environment
Data collection method The setup of this study
was similar to the one used to collect the GIVE-2
corpus of typed instructions (Gargett et al, 2010).
Instruction followers (IFs) used the standard GIVE-2
client to interact with the virtual environment. In-
struction givers (IGs) could observe the followers?
position and actions in the world using an interactive
map, and they were also provided with the same 3D
view into the scene that the IFs saw on their screen.
Differently from the normal GIVE-2 scenario, the
IGs did not type their instructions but gave spoken
instructions, which were audio recorded as well as
streamed to the IFs over the network. A log of the IFs?
position, orientation and actions that was updated ev-
ery 200ms was recorded in a database.
Participants were recruited in pairs on Bielefeld
University?s campus and received a compensation
of six euros each. They were randomly assigned
to the roles of IG and IF and were seated and in-
structed separately. To become familiar with the task,
they switched roles in a first, shorter training world.
These interactions were later used to devise and test
the annotation schemes. They then played two dif-
ferent worlds in their assigned roles. After the first
round, they received a questionnaire assessing the
quality of the interaction; after the second round, they
completed the Santa Barbara sense of direction test
(Hegarty et al, 2006) and answered some questions
about themselves.
Annotations The recorded instructions of the IGs
were transcribed and segmented into utterances (by
identifying speech pauses longer than 300ms) using
Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2011). We then created
videos showing the IGs? map view as well as the IFs?
scene view and aligned the audio and transcriptions
with them. The data was further annotated by the first
two authors using ELAN (Wittenburg et al, 2006).
Most importantly for this paper, we classified ut-
terances into the following types:
(i) move (MV) ? instruction to turn or to move
(ii) manipulate (MNP) ? instruction to manipulate an object
(e.g., press a button)
(iii) reference (REF) ? utterance referring to an object
(iv) stop ? instruction to stop moving
(v) warning ? telling the user to not do something
(vi) acknowledgment (ACK) ? affirmative feedback
(vii) communication management (CM) ? indicating that the
IG is planning (e.g., uhmm, just a moment, sooo etc.)
(viii) negative acknowledgment ? indicating a mistake on the
player?s part
(ix) other ? anything else
A few utterances which contained both move and
press instructions were further split, but in general
we picked the label that fit best (using the above list
as a precedence order to make a decision if two labels
fit equally well). The inter-annotator agreement for
utterance types was ? = 0.89 (Cohen?s kappa), which
13
is considered to be very good. Since the categories
were of quite different sizes (cf. Table 1), which may
skew the ? statistic, we also calculated the kappa per
category. It was satisfactory for all ?interesting? cate-
gories. The agreement for category REF was ? = 0.77
and the agreement for other was ? = 0.58. The kappa
values for all other categories were 0.84 or greater.
We reviewed all cases with differing annotations and
reached a consensus, which is the basis for all results
presented in this paper. Furthermore, we collapsed
the labels warning, negative acknowledgment and
other which only occurred rarely.
To support a later more in depth analysis, we also
annotated what types of properties are used in object
descriptions, the givenness status of information in
instructions, and whether an utterance is giving pos-
itive or negative feedback on a user action (even if
not explicitly labeled as (negative) acknowledgment).
Finally, information about the IF?s movements and
actions in the world as well as the visible context was
automatically calculated from the GIVE log files and
integrated into the annotation.
Collected data We collected interactions between
eight pairs. Due to failures of the network connection
and some initial problems with the GIVE software,
only four pairs were recorded completely, so that
we currently have data from eight interactions with
four different IGs. We are in the process of collect-
ing additional data in order to achieve a corpus size
that will allow for a more detailed statistical analy-
sis. Furthermore, we are collecting data in English
to be able to make comparisons with the existing
corpus of written instructions in the GIVE world and
to make the data more easily accessible to a wider
audience. The corpus will be made freely available
at http://purl.org/net/sgive-corpus.
Participants were between 20 and 30 years old and
all of them are native German speakers. Two of the
IGs are male and two female; three of the IFs are
female. The mean length of the interactions is 5.24
minutes (SD= 1.86), and the IGs on average use 325
words (SD = 91).
Table 1 gives an overview of the kinds of ut-
terances used by the IGs. While the general pic-
ture is similar for all speakers, there are statisti-
cally significant differences between the frequen-
cies with which different IGs use the utterance types

two rounds that each pair played.
3 How instruction givers describe objects
We now examine how interaction partners establish
what the next target button is. Overall, there are 76
utterance sequences in the data that identify a target
button and lead to the IF pressing that button. We
discuss a selection of seven representative examples.
(2) IG: und dann dr?ckst du den ganz rechten Knopf den
blauen (and then you press the rightmost button the
blue one; MNP)
IF: [goes across the room and does it]
In (2) the IG generates a referring expression iden-
tifying the target and integrates it into an object ma-
nipulation instruction. In our data, 55% of the tar-
get buttons (42 out of 76) get identified in this way
(which fits into the traditional view of referring ex-
pression generation). In all other cases a sequence of
at least two, and in 14% of the cases more than two,
utterances is used.
The transitional probabilities between utterance
types shown in Table 2 suggest what some common
patterns may be. For example, even though move
instructions are so prevalent in our data, they are
uncommon after reference or manipulate utterances.
14
Instead, two thirds of the reference utterances are
followed by object manipulation instruction, another
reference or an acknowledgement. In the remaining
cases, IFs press a button in response to the reference.
(3) IG: vor dir der blaue Knopf (in front of you the blue button;
REF)
IF: [moves across the room toward the button]
IG: drauf dr?cken (press it; MNP)
(4) IG: und auf der rechten Seite sind zwei rote Kn?pfe (and
on the right are two red buttons; REF)
IF: [turns and starts moving towards the buttons]
IG: und den linken davon dr?ckst du (and you press the left
one; MNP)
In (3) and (4) a first reference utterance is followed
by a separate object manipulation utterance. While
in (3) the first reference uniquely identifies the target,
in (4) the first utterance simply directs the player?s
attention to a group of buttons. The second utterance
then picks out the target.
(5) IG: dreh dich nach links etwas (turn left a little; MV)
IF: [turns left] there are two red buttons in front of him
(and some other red buttons to his right)
IG: so, da siehst du zwei rote Schalter (so now you see two
red buttons; REF)
IF: [moves towards buttons]
IG: und den rechten davon dr?ckst du (and you press the
right one; MNP)
IF: [moves closer, but more towards the left one]
IG: rechts (right; REF)
Stoia (2007) observed that IGs use move instruc-
tions to focus the IF?s attention on a particular area.
This is also common in our data. For instance in (5),
the IF is asked to turn to directly face the group of
buttons containing the target. (5) also shows how IGs
monitor their partners? actions and respond to them.
The IF is moving towards the wrong button causing
the IG to repeat part of the previous description.
(6) IG: den blauen Schalter (the blue button; REF)
IF: [moves and then stops]
IG: den du rechts siehst (the one you see on your right;
REF)
IF: [starts moving again]
IG: den dr?cken (press that one; MNP)
Similarly, in (6) the IG produces an elaboration
when the IF stops moving towards the target, indicat-
ing her confusion.
(7) IG: und jetzt rechts an der (and now to the right on the;
REF)
IF: [turns right, is facing the wall with the target button]
IG: ja . . . genau . . . an der Wand den blauen Knopf (yes
. . . right . . . on the wall the blue button; ACK, REF)
IF: [moves towards button]
IG: einmal dr?cken (press once; MNP)
In (7) the IG inserts affirmative feedback when
the IF reacts correctly to a portion of his utterance.
As can be seen in Table 2, reference utterances are
relatively often followed by affirmative feedback.
(8) IF: [enters room, stops, looks around, ends up looking at
the target]
IG: ja genau den gr?nen Knopf neben der Lampe dr?cken
(yes right, press the green button next to the lamp;
MNP)
IGs can also take advantage of IF actions that are
not in direct response to an utterance. This happens
in (8). The IF enters a new room and looks around.
When she looks towards the target, the IG seizes the
opportunity and produces affirmative feedback.
4 Conclusions and future work
We have described a corpus of spoken instructions in
the GIVE scenario which we are currently building
and which we will make available once it is com-
pleted. This corpus differs from other corpora of task-
oriented dialog (specifically, the MapTask corpus
(Anderson et al, 1991), the TRAINS corpus (Hee-
man and Allen, 1995), the Monroe corpus (Stent,
2000)) in that the IG could observe the IF?s actions
in real-time. This led to interactions in which in-
structions are given in installments and linguistic and
non-linguistic actions are interleaved.
This poses interesting new questions for NLG sys-
tems, which we have illustrated by discussing the
patterns of utterance sequences that IGs and IFs use
in our corpus to agree on the objects that need to
be manipulated. In line with results from psycholin-
guistics, we found that the information necessary to
establish a reference is often expressed in multiple
installments and that IGs carefully monitor how their
partners react to their instructions and quickly re-
spond by giving feedback, repeating information or
elaborating on previous utterance when necessary.
The NLG system thus needs to be able to de-
cide when a complete identifying description can
be given in one utterance and when a description in
installments is more effective. Stoia (2007) as well
as Garoufi and Koller (2010) have addressed this
question, but their approaches only make a choice be-
tween generating an instruction to move or a uniquely
identifying referring expression. They do not con-
sider cases in which another type of utterance, for
instance, one that refers to a group of objects or gives
15
an initial ambiguous description, is used to draw the
attention of the IF to a particular area and they do not
generate referring expressions in installments.
The system, furthermore, needs to be able to in-
terpret the IF?s actions and decide when to insert an
acknowledgment, elaboration or correction. It then
has to decide how to formulate this feedback. The
addressee, e.g., needs to be able to distinguish elabo-
rations from corrections. If the feedback was inserted
in the middle of a sentence, if finally has to decide
whether this sentence should be completed and how
the remainder may have to be adapted.
Once we have finished the corpus collection, we
plan to use it to study and address the questions dis-
cussed above. We are planning on building on the
work by Stoia (2007) on using machine learning tech-
niques to develop a model that takes into account var-
ious contextual factors and on the work by Thompson
(2009) on generating references in installments. The
set-up under which the corpus was collected, further-
more, lends itself well to Wizard-of-Oz studies to test
the effectiveness of different interactive strategies for
describing objects.
