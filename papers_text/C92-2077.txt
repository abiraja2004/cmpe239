Abstract  
This paper presents a 
descr ipt ion of automatic 
d ict ionar ies (ADs) and dict ionary 
entry (DE) schemes for NLP 
systems deal ing with Or iental  
languages. The uni formity of the 
AD organizat ion and of the DE 
pattern does not prevent the 
system from taking into account 
the structural  d i f ferences of 
isolat ing (analytical),  aggluti -  
nat ing and internal - f lect ion 
languages. 
The "Speech Stat ist ics" (SpSt) 
pro ject  team has been des igning a 
l inguist ic  automaton aimed at NL 
process ing in a var iety of forms. 
In addit ion to Germanic and 
Romance languages the system 
under development is to handle 
text process ing of a number of 
Or iental  languages. The strategy 
adopted by th~ SpSt ~roup is 
character ized by a lex ical ized 
approach: the NLP algorit}nns for 
any language are ent i re ly AD 
dependent, i.e., a large lexicon 
database has been provided, its 
entr ies being loaded with 
informat ion inc luding not only 
lexical, but also morphological ,  
syntact ic  and semantic data. This 
information concentrated in 
d ict ionary entr ies (DEs) is 
essential  for both source text 
analysis and target (Russian) 
text generation. 
The DE structure is largely 
determined by the typological  
features of the source language. 
The SpSt group has hi therto had 
to deal w.ith European languages 
and it was for these languages 
( inf lect ive and inf lect ive - 
analytical)  that the prototype 
entry schemes were e laborated and 
adopted. No doubt, the 
typological  character is t ics  of 
Or iental  languages required 
certain modi f icat ions to be made 
%o the basic scheme. Hence in the 
present paper each of the 
language types is given 
considerat ion.  Agg lut inat ing  
languages proved to be the most 
suitable to process according to 
the SpSt strategy. But an isolat- 
ing language will be the f irst 
to be proposed for discussion. 
I. The AD organizat ion for a~ 
isolat ing language: Chinese 
For the purposes of NLP it is 
p laus ib le  to assume written 
Chinese as exc lus ive ly  isolat ing 
language where af f ixat ion is 
v i r tual ly  non-existent.  The few 
inf lect ive word-forms are entered 
into the lexicon as unana l i zab le  
lexical items, whereas mult ip le  
grammar formants are t reated as 
free structural elements. High 
degree of lexical ambiguity 
making syntact ic  d isambiguat ion  a 
must, and the fact that word 
boundar ies are not expl ic i t ly

marked in the text are wel l -known 
problems with Chinese text 
analysis. (Actually, in the 
MULTIS project e laborated by the 
SpSt group Chinese characters are 
t ransformed into 4-digit  str ings 
in conformity with Chinese 
Standard Telegraph Code). 
Thus grammatical  and logico - 
semantic relat ions in the text 
are expressed by  word order, 
structural words and semantic 
valencies. In addit ion to their 
role of the labels for syntactic 
units (predicate, direct and 
indirect objects, etc.) the 
structural  words funct ion as 
del imitators  s ingl ing out 
word-forms and phrases. A 
separate sub- lexicon for 
structural  words is accordingly 
provided within the whole lexicon 
database of Chinese as source 
language. The fi le of not ional  
words comprises lexical items of 
var ious lengths ranging from 
one-character  items to 
eight-character ones, no 
d i f ferent iat ion being made among 
one-stem words, composite words 
and phrases. A dist inct vers ion 
of the DE scheme is assigned to 
each of the two classes of 
lexical items: notional words (N/ 
W) and structural  words (S/W). 
The DE scheme for N/W 
includes, along with syntact ic 
and semantic, the fo l lowing data: 
i) Part - of - ~pcech assignment; 
2) Information on the lexical 
ambiguity. Thus, by way of 
example, the one-stem word sudan 
'sultan' and composite beida 
'Bei j ing University' are coded 
N00, where N denotes noun, whi le 
q ianding 'to sign a treaty' is 
coded 0S0 where S denotes 
verb/noun lexicui ambiguity (to 
be eventual ly  d isambiguated by 
syntactic means). 
As to the DE schemes for 
S/Ws, each of these should 
include posit ional  
character ist ics  of the lexieal 
item and provide information on 
the way the given part ic le 
affects formation of the Russian 
equivalent. E.g., in the 
grammatical  coding of the verbal 
aspect S/W le and nominal  S/Ws de 
and ba the fo l lowing points are 
marked: i) part - of - speech 
dependence; 2) posit ion (pro- or 
post -pos i t ion  with respect to the 
N/W); 3) Russian matching;. 
4) syntact ic function. 
The information placed in a DE 
may be used in t ranslat ing 
sentences as i l lustrated below: 
Sudan ba heyue qi-~sding 
The sultan the peace treaty signed 
In carry ing out the lexico - 
syntact ical  analysis of this 
sentence two word groups are 
del imitated : nominal  group ba 
heyue and verbal  group 
quanding le. In the ba-DE there 
are data to define ba as a S/W in 
preposi t ion to a direct object 
which is equivalent  to a Russian 
noun in the Accusat ive Case. In 
the le-OE there are data to 
def ine le as a verbal index in a 
post -pos i t ion  to a verbal 
predicate and indicat ing the 
complet ion of an action, 
equivalent  to a Russian verb in 
the Past Tense, Perfective. (For 
the sake of s impl ic i ty the 
polyvalent  and polysemant ic  
nature of these part ic les is 
ignored in this example). 
2. The AD organizat ion for an 
agglut inat ing language: Turkish 
The agglut inat ive 
word- format ion technique is 
character ized by ordered addit iun 
of aff ixes to the stem to preOuce 
formant str ings of various 
lengths. An outstanding feature 
of agglut inat ing languages is 
that these word- forms are not 
reproduced ready-made in speech 
but are constructed by the 
speaker actual ly 'ad hoc' 
according to def in i te rules. Each 
of the l imited set of aff ixes 
imparts 'a semantic quant' or

analysis  restarts with access to 
Graph 2 on the assumption that 
the input text word is a f inite 
verb form, etc. This sequential  
access to graphs does not take 
place at random but has been 
programmed according to the 
f requency data received by a 
prel iminary quant i tat ive analysis 
of some text corpora. 
3. The AD organizat ion for 
internal - f lect ion languages: 
Arabic and Hebrew. 
The word morphology of Arabic 
and Hebrew is not only 
character ized by internal 
f lect ion but also by a rather 
wide use of agglut inat ive formants 
and external flection. Taking 
into account these features of 
the Semit ic word-form structure 
three di f ferent approaches to AD 
design seem plausible. 
i. Representat ion of lexicon 
items by word-forms l isted in 
a lphabet ical  order; in this case 
the fo l lowing Hebrew words would 
have three independent DEs: 
1 ~f~ SiLTWoN suit.an 6~@ SiLTWoNJ iM sultans S~LT~Ne;. sultans 
~ (status constructus)  
2. An alphabetical  arrangement 
of machine stems as has been made 
for European languages; in this 
case the above Hebrew wordforms 
may be reduced to only one item. 
3. Designing the source 
lexicon as a lexicon of roots; 
all above-ment ioned Hebrew 
word-forms would then be 
representated by the root ~ .~.~ 
SLTN supplemented 
with l ists of internal and 
external  affixes. 
Since word- format ion and word- 
bu i ld ing  in Semitic languages are 
pract ica l ly  l imit less the option 
of the f irst or second approaches 
would cause a dimension crisis 
with respect to the lexicon size: 
the AD would surpass the cr it ical  
storage capacity whi le the 
dict ionary search would be 
strongly impeded. 
With root-based AD 
organizat ion the root-or ig inated 
word- form development process 
fol lows the order: 
"root-der ivat ion - internal 
f lect ion types rules of 
combinat ion with def inite 
external  affixes". Unfortunately,  
this kind of AD organizat ion 
requires, for the purposes of the 
text-word lex ico-grammatical  
analysis, a mult ip le access to 
the hard disk, and this would 
again cause a d imension crisis, 
now with respect to the system 
operat ing speed. 
To rel ieve the dimension 
crisis a trade-off  may be 
suggested: combined root-based 
and alphabet ic  approach to 
construct ion, operat ion and 
maintenance of the AD. With this 
approach five lists (sub- 
lexicons) of l inguist ic  units are 
dist inguished. 
i. List of roots actual ly in use 
(some 500 for Hebrew, 200 for 
Arabic). 
2. List of internal f lect ions 
(some 800 for Hebrew, 900 for 
Arabic). 
3. A lphabet ic  list of words with 
regular word- format ion (nouns, 
adjectives, also basic forms of 
verbs); 
4. List of words of Semit ic 
or igin with irrigular 
word- format ion and borrowed words 
(i.e., those where tr i l i teral  
scheme is not observed). E.g., 
,/)t' 'day', , _O '~ days (this 
is one of the" few Hebrew nouns 
where the internal f lect ion is 
changed with word-formation) .  
~ f ~  'to telegraph' 
(a borrowed word, not subject to 
conjugat ion rules). 
~ 'to take' root 
I~4,), two root letters are omitted
