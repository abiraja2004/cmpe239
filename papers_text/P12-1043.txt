Abstract
Extracting sentiment and topic lexicons is im-
portant for opinion mining. Previous works
have showed that supervised learning methods
are superior for this task. However, the perfor-
mance of supervised methods highly relies on
manually labeled training data. In this paper,
we propose a domain adaptation framework
for sentiment- and topic- lexicon co-extraction
in a domain of interest where we do not re-
quire any labeled data, but have lots of labeled
data in another related domain. The frame-
work is twofold. In the first step, we gener-
ate a few high-confidence sentiment and topic
seeds in the target domain. In the second
step, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive
bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the
seeds in the target domain by exploiting the
labeled source domain data and the relation-
ships between topic and sentiment words. Ex-
perimental results show that our domain adap-
tation framework can extract precise lexicons
in the target domain without any annotation.
1 Introduction
In the past few years, opinion mining and senti-
ment analysis have attracted much attention in Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) and Information Re-
trieval (IR) (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010). Senti-
ment lexicon construction and topic lexicon extrac-
tion are two fundamental subtasks for opinion min-
ing (Qiu et al, 2009). A sentiment lexicon is a list
of sentiment expressions, which are used to indicate
sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative). The
sentiment lexicon is domain dependent as users may
use different sentiment words to express their opin-
ion in different domains (e.g., different products). A
topic lexicon is a list of topic expressions, on which
the sentiment words are expressed. Extracting the
topic lexicon from a specific domain is important
because users not only care about the overall senti-
ment polarity of a review but also care about which
aspects are mentioned in review. Note that, similar
to sentiment lexicons, different domains may have
very different topic lexicons.
Recently, Jin and Ho (2009) and Li et al (2010a)
showed that supervised learning methods can
achieve state-of-the-art results for lexicon extrac-
tion. However, the performance of these meth-
ods highly relies on manually annotated training
data. In most cases, the labeling work may be time-
consuming and expensive. It is impossible to anno-
tate each domain of interest to build precise domain-
dependent lexicons. It is more desirable to automat-
ically construct precise lexicons in domains of inter-
est by transferring knowledge from other domains.
In this paper, we focus on the co-extraction task
of sentiment and topic lexicons in a target domain
where we do not have any labeled data, but have
plenty of labeled data in a source domain. Our
goal is to leverage the knowledge extracted from the
source domain to help lexicon co-extraction in the
target domain. To address this problem, we propose
a two-stage domain adaptation method. In the first
step, we build a bridge between the source and tar-
get domains by identifying some common sentiment
words as sentiment seeds in the target domain, such
as ?good?, ?bad?, ?nice?, etc. After that, we gener-
ate topic seeds in the target domain by mining some
general syntactic relation patterns between the sen-
timent and topic words from the source domain. In
the second step, we propose a Relational Adaptive
bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the seeds
in the target domain. Our proposed method can uti-
410
lize useful labeled data from the source domain as
well as exploit the relationships between the topic
and sentiment words to propagate information for
lexicon construction in the target domain. Experi-
mental results show that our proposed method is ef-
fective for cross-domain lexicon co-extraction.
In summary, we have three main contributions: 1)
We give a systematic study on cross-domain senti-
ment analysis in word level. While, most of previous
work focused on document level; 2) A new two-step
domain adaptation framework, with a novel RAP al-
gorithm for seed expansion, is proposed. 3) We con-
duct extensive evaluation, and the experimental re-
sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
2 Related Work
2.1 Sentiment or Topic Lexicon Extraction
Sentiment or topic lexicon extraction is to iden-
tify the sentiment or topic words from text. In the
past, many machine learning techniques have been
proposed for this task. Hu and Liu et al (2004)
proposed an association-rule-based method to ex-
tract topic words and a dictionary-based method to
identify sentiment words, independently. Wiebe et
al. (2004) and Rioff et al (2003) proposed to
identify subjective adjectives and nouns using word
clustering based on their distributional similarity.
Popescu and Etzioni (2005) proposed a relaxed la-
beling approach to utilize linguistic rules for opinion
polarity detection. Some researchers also proposed
to use topic modeling to identify implicit topics and
sentiment words (Mei et al, 2007; Titov and Mc-
Donald, 2008; Zhao et al, 2010; Li et al, 2010b),
where a topic is a cluster of words, which is differ-
ent from our fine-grained topic-word extraction.
Jin and Ho (2009) and Li et al (2010a) both pro-
posed to use supervised sequential labeling methods
for topic and opinion extraction. Experimental re-
sults showed that the supervised learning methods
can achieve state-of-the-art performance on lexicon
extraction. However, these methods need to manu-
ally annotate a lot of training data in each domain.
Recently, Qiu et al (2009) proposed a rule-based
semi-supervised learning methods for lexicon ex-
traction. However, their method requires to manu-
ally define some general syntactic rules among sen-
timent and topic words. In addition, it still requires
some annotated words in the target domain. In this
paper, we do not assume any predefined rules and
labeled data be available in the target domain.
2.2 Domain Adaptation
Domain adaptation aims at transferring knowledge
across domains where data distributions may be dif-
ferent (Pan and Yang, 2010). In the past few years,
domain adaptation techniques have been widely ap-
plied to various NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech
tagging (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Jiang and Zhai,
2007; Daume? III, 2007), named-entity recognition
and shallow parsing (Daume? III, 2007; Jiang and
Zhai, 2007; Wu et al, 2009). There are also
lots of studies for cross-domain sentiment analy-
sis (Blitzer et al, 2007; Tan et al, 2007; Li et al,
2009; Pan et al, 2010; Bollegala et al, 2011; He
et al, 2011; Glorot et al, 2011). However, most
of them focused on coarse-grained document-level
sentiment classification, which is different from our
fine-grained word-level extraction. Our work is sim-
ilar to Jakob and Gurevych (2010) which proposed a
Conditional Random Field (CRF) for cross-domain
topic word extraction. However, the performance
of their method highly depends on the manually de-
signed features. In our experiments, we compare our
method with theirs, and find that ours can achieve
much better results on cross-domain lexicon extrac-
tion. Note that our work is also different from a re-
cent work (Du et al, 2010), which focused on identi-
fying the polarity of adjective words by using cross-
domain knowledge. While we extract both topic and
sentiment words and allow non-adjective sentiment
words, which is more practical.
3 Cross-Domain Lexicon Co-Extraction
3.1 Problem Definition
Recall that, we focus on the setting where we have
no labeled data in the target domain, while we have
plenty of labeled data in the source domain. De-
note DS = {(wSi , ySi)}n1i=1 the source domain data,
where wSi represents a word in the source domain.
ySi ? Y is the corresponding label of wSi . Simi-
larly, we denote DT = {wTj}n2j=1 the target domain
data, where the input wTj is a word in the target do-
main. In lexicon extraction, Y ? {1, 2, 3}, where
yi = 1 denotes the corresponding word wi a sen-
timent word, yi = 2 denotes wi a topic word, and
yi = 3 denotes wi neither a sentiment nor topic
word. Our goal is to predict labels on DT to extract
topic and sentiment words for constructing topic and
411
sentiment lexicons, respectively.
3.2 Motivating Examples
In this section, we use some examples to introduce
the motivation behind our proposed method. Table 1
shows several reviews from two domains: movie and
camera. From the table, we can observe that there
are some common sentiment words across different
domains, such as ?great?, ?excellent? and ?amaz-
ing?. However, the topic words may be different.
For example, in the movie domain, topic words in-
clude ?movie? and ?script?. While in the camera do-
main, topic words include ?camera? and ?photos?.
Domain Review
camera
The camera is great.
it is a very amazing product.
i highly recommend this camera.
takes excellent photos.
photos had some artifacts and noise.
movie
This movie has good script, great
casting, excellent acting.
I love this movie.
Godfather was the most amazing movie.
The movie is excellent.
Table 1: Reviews in camera and movie domains. Bold-
faces are topic words and Italics are sentiment words.
Based on the observations, we can build a connec-
tion between the source and target domains by iden-
tifying the common sentiment words. Furthermore,
intuitively, there are some general syntactic relation-
ships or patterns between topic and sentiment words
across different domains. Therefore, if we can mine
the patterns from the source and target domain data,
then we are able to construct an indirect connection
between topic words across domains by using the
common sentiment words as a bridge, which makes
knowledge transfer across domains possible.
Figure 1 shows two dependency trees for the sen-
tence ?the camera is great? in the camera domain
and the sentence ?the movie is excellent? in the
movie domain, respectively. As can be observed, the
relationships between the topic and sentiment words
in the two sentences are the same. They both share
a ?TOPIC-nsubj-SENTIMENT? relation. Let the
camera domain be the source domain and the movie
domain be the target domain. If the word ?excel-
lent? is identified as a common sentiment word, and
the ?TOPIC-nsubj-SENTIMENT? relation extracted
from the camera domain is recognized as a common
syntactic pattern, then the word ?movie? can be pre-
dicted as a topic word in the movie domain with high
probability. After new topic words are extracted in
the movie domain, we can apply the same syntac-
tic pattern or other syntactic patterns to extract new
sentiment and topic words iteratively.

Figure 1: Examples of dependency tree structure.
More specifically, we use the shortest path be-
tween a topic word and a sentiment word in the cor-
responding dependency tree to denote the relation
between them. To get more general paths, we do
not take original words in the path into considera-
tion, but use their POS tags instead, such as ?NN?,
?VB?, ?JJ?, etc. As an example shown in Figure 2,
we can extract two paths or relationships between
topic and sentiment words from the dependency tree
of the sentence ?The movie has good script?: ?NN-
amod-JJ? from ?script? and ?good?, and ?NN-nsubj-

In the following sections, we present the proposed
two-stage domain adaptation framework: 1) gener-
ating some sentiment and topic seeds in the target
domain; and 2) expanding the seeds in the target do-
main to construct sentiment and topic lexicons.
4 Seed Generation
Our basic idea is to first identify several common
sentiment words across domains as sentiment seeds.
Meanwhile, we mine some general patterns between
sentiment and topic words from the source domain.
Finally, we use the sentiment seeds and general pat-
terns to generate topic seeds in the target domain.
412
4.1 Sentiment Seed Generation
To identify common sentiment words across do-
mains, we extract all sentiment words from the
source domain as candidates. For each candidate,
we calculate its score based on the following metric:
S1(wi) = (pS(wi) + pT (wi)) e(?|pS(wi)?pT (wi)|), (1)
where pS(wi) and pT (wi) are the probabilities of the
word wi occurring in the source and target domains,
respectively. If a word wi has high S1 score, which
implies that the word wi occurs frequently and simi-
larly in both domains, then it can be considered as a
common sentiment word (Pan et al, 2010; Blitzer et
al., 2007). We select top r candidates with highest
S1 scores as sentiment seeds.
4.2 Topic Seed Generation
We extract all patterns between sentiment and topic
words in the source domain as candidates. For each
pattern candidate, we calculate its score based on a
metric defined in AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996):
S2(Rj) = Acc(Rj)? log2(Freq(Rj)), (2)
where Acc(Rj) is the accuracy of the pattern Rj in
the source domain, and Freq(Rj) is the frequency
of the pattern Rj observed in target domain. This
metric aims to identify the patterns that are precise
in the source domain and observed frequently in the
target domain. We also select the top r patterns
with highest S2 scores. With the patterns and sen-
timent seeds, we extract topic-word candidates and
measure their scores based on a variant metric of
quadratic combination (Zhang and Ye, 2008):
S3(wk) =
?
Rj?A, wi?B
(S2(Rj)? S1(wi)) , (3)
where B is a set of sentiment seeds and A is a set of
patterns which the words wi and wk satisfy. We then
select the top r candidates as topic seeds.
5 Seed Expansion
After generating the topic and sentiment seeds, we
aim to expand them in the target domain to construct
topic and sentiment lexicons. In this section, we pro-
pose a new bootstrapping-based method to address
this problem.
Bootstrapping is the process of improving the per-
formance of a weak classifier by iteratively adding
training data and retraining the classifier. More
specifically, bootstrapping starts with a small set
of labeled ?seeds?, and iteratively adds unlabeled
data that are labeled by the classifier to the train-
ing set based on some selection criterion, and retrain
the classifier. Many bootstrapping-based algorithms
have been proposed to information extraction and
other NLP tasks (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Riloff
and Jones, 1999; Jones et al, 1999; Wu et al, 2009).
One important issue in bootstrapping is how to
design a criterion to select unlabeled data to be
added to the training set iteratively. Our proposed
bootstrapping for cross-domain lexicon extraction
is based on the following two observations: 1) Al-
though the source and target domains are different,
part of source domain labeled data is still useful for
lexicon extraction in the target domain after some
adaptation; 2) The syntactic relationships among
sentiment and topic words can be used to expand the
seeds in the target domain for lexicon construction.
Based on the two observations, we propose a
new bootstrapping-based method named Relational
Adaptive bootstraPping (RAP), as summarized in
Algorithm 1, for expanding lexicons across do-
mains. In each iteration, we employ a cross-domain
classifier trained on the source domain lexicons and
the extracted target domain lexicons to predict the
labels of the target unlabeled data, and select top k2
predicted topic and sentiment words as candidates
based on confidence. With the extracted syntactic
patterns in the previous iterations, we construct a
bipartite graph between sentiment and topic words
on the extracted target domain lexicons and candi-
dates. After that, a graph-based score refinement al-
gorithm is performed on the graph, and the top k1
candidates are added to the extracted lexicons based
on the final scores. Accordingly, with the new ex-
tracted lexicons, we update the syntactic patterns in
each iteration. The details of RAP are presented in
the following sections.
5.1 Cross-Domain Classifier
In this paper, we employ Transfer AdaBoost (TrAd-
aBoost) (Dai et al, 2007) as the cross-domain learn-
ing algorithm in RAP. In TrAdaBoost, each word
wSi (or wTj ) is represented by a feature vector xSi
(or xTj ). A classifier trained on the source domain
data DS = {(xSi , ySi)} may perform poor on xTj
because of domain difference. The main idea of
TrAdaBoost is to re-weight the source domain data
based on a few of target domain labeled data, which
is referred to as seeds in our task. The re-weighting
413
aims to reduce the effect of the ?bad? source do-
main data while encourage the ?good? ones to get
a more precise classifier in target domain. In each
iteration of RAP, we train cross-domain classifiers
fTO and fTP for sentiment- and topic- word extrac-
tion using TrAdaBoost separately (taking sentiment
or topic words as positive instances). We use linear
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as the base clas-
sifier in TrAdaBoost. For features to represent each
word, we use lexicon features, such as the previous,
current and next words, and POS tag features, such
as the previous, current and next words? POS tags.

Update S?1(wi) and S?3(wj) accordingly.

5.2 Graph Construction
Based on the cross-domain classifiers fTO and fTP ,
we can predict the sentiment label score hTfO(wTi)
and topic label score hTfP (wTi) for the target domain
data wTi . According to all predicted values, we re-
spectively select top k2 new sentiment- and topic-
words as candidates. Together with the extracted
sentiment and topic lexicons in the target domain,
we build a bipartite graph among them as shown in
Figure 3. In the bipartite graph, one set of nodes
represents topic words, including new topic candi-
dates and words in the lexicon C, and the other set
of nodes represents sentiment words, including new
sentiment candidates and words in the lexicon B.
For a pair of sentiment and topic words wOTi and w
P
Tj ,
if there is a pattern Rj in the pattern set A that they
can satisfy, then there exists an edge eij between
them. Furthermore, each edge eij is associated with
a nonnegative weight ?ij , which is measured as fol-
lows, ?ij =
?
Rk?E S?2(Rk), where S?2 is the pattern
score. Similar to the metric defined in Eq. (3), the
pattern score is defined as:
S?2(Rj) =
?
{wi,wk}?E
(
S?1(wi)? S?3(wk)
)
, (4)
where E = {{wi, wj}|, wi ? B,wj ? C and
wi, wj satisfy Rj , Rj ? A}. Note that in the be-
ginning of each iteration, S?2 is updated based on the
new sentiment score S?1 and topic score S?3. We fur-
ther normalize ?ij by ??ij = ?ij/(
?
ij ?ij).

5.3 Score Computation
We construct the bipartite graph to exploit the re-
lationships between sentiment and topic words to
propagate information for lexicon extraction. We
use the following reinforcement formulas to itera-
tively update the final sentiment score S?1(wTj ) and
topic score S?3(wTi), respectively:
S?1(wTj ) = ?
?
i
S?3(wTi)??ij + (1? ?)hTfO (wTj ), (5)
S?3(wTi) = ?
?
j
S?1(wTj )??ij + (1? ?)hTfP (wTi), (6)
where ? is a trade-off parameter between the pre-
dicted value by cross-domain classifier and the re-
inforcement scores from other nodes connected by
414
edge eij . Here ? is empirically set to be 0.5. With
Eqs. (5) and (6), the sentiment scores and topic
scores are iteratively refined until the state of the
graph trends to be stable. This can be considered
as an extension to the HITS algorithm(Kleinberg,
1999). Finally, we select k1 ? k2 sentiment and
topic words from the k2 candidates based on their
refined scores, and add them to the target domain
lexicons, respectively. We also update the sentiment
score S?1 and topic score S?3 for next iteration.
5.4 Special Cases
We now introduce two special cases of the RAP al-
gorithm. In Eqs. (5) and (6), if the parameter ? = 1,
then RAP only uses the relationships between sen-
timent and topic words with their patterns to propa-
gate label information in the target domain without
using the cross-domain classifier. We call this reduc-
tion relational bootstrapping. If ? = 0, then RAP
only utilizes useful source domain labeled data to as-
sist learning of the target domain classifier without
considering the relationships between sentiment and
topic words. We call this reduction adaptive boot-
strapping, which can be considered as a bootstrap-
ping version of TrAdaBoost. We also empirically
study these two special cases in experiments.
6 Experiments on Lexicon Evaluation
6.1 Data Set and Evaluation Criteria
We use the review dataset from (Li et al, 2010a),
which contains 500 movie and 601 product reviews,
for evaluation. The sentiment and topic words are
manually annotated. In this dataset, all types of
sentiment words are annotated instead of adjective
words only. For example, the verbs, such as ?like?,
?recommend?, and nouns, such as ?masterpiece?,
are also labeled as sentiment words. We construct
two cross-domain lexicon extraction tasks: ?prod-
uct vs. movie? and ?movie vs. product?, where the
word before ?vs.? corresponds with the source do-
main and the word after ?vs.? corresponds with the
target domain. We evaluate our methods in terms of
precision, recall and F-score (F1).
6.2 Baselines
The results of in-domain classifiers, which are
trained on plenty of target domain labeled data, can
be treated as upper-bounds. We denote iSVM and
iCRF the in-domain SVM and CRF classifiers in
experiments, and compare our proposed methods,
RAP, relational bootstrapping, and adaptive boot-
strapping, with the following baselines,
Unsupervised Method (Un) we implement a rule-
based method for lexicon extraction based on (Hu
and Liu, 2004), where adjective words that match
a rule is recognized as sentiment words, and nouns
that match a rule are recognized as topic words.
Semi-Supervised Method (Semi) we implement
the double propagation model proposed in (Qiu et
al., 2009). Since this method requires some target
domain labeled data, we manually label 30 senti-
ment words in the target domain.
Cross-Domain CRF (Cross-CRF) we implement
a cross-domain CRF algorithm proposed by (Jakob
and Gurevych, 2010).
TrAdaBoost We apply TrAdaBoost (Dai et al,
2007) on the source domain labeled data and the
generated seeds in the target domain to train a lexi-
con extractor.
6.3 Comparison Results
Comparison results on lexicon extraction are shown
in Table 2 and Table 3. From Table 2, we can ob-
serve that our proposed methods are effective for
sentiment lexicon extraction. The relational boot-
strapping method performs better than the unsuper-
vised method, TrAdaBoost and the cross-domain
CRF algorithm, and achieves comparable results
with the semi-supervised method. However, com-
pared to the semi-supervised method, our proposed
relational bootstrapping method does not require any
labeled data in the target domain. We can also ob-
serve that the adaptive bootstrapping method and the
RAP method perform much better than other meth-
ods in terms of F-score. The reason is that part of
the source domain labeled data may be useful for
learning the target classifier after reweighting. In
addition, we also observe that embedding the TrAd-
aBoost algorithm into a bootstrapping process can
further boost the performance of the classifier for
sentiment lexicon extraction.
Table 3 shows the comparison results on topic lex-
icon extraction. From the table, we can observe that
different from the sentiment lexicon extraction task,
the relational bootstrapping method performs better
than the adaptive bootstrapping method slightly. The
reason may be that for the sentiment lexicon extrac-
tion task, there exist some common sentiment words

across domains, thus part of the labeled source do-
main data may be useful for the target learning task.
However, for the topic lexicon extraction task, the
topic words may be totally different, and as a result,
we may not be able to find useful source domain
labeled data to boost the performance for lexicon
extraction in the target domain. In this case, mu-
tual label propagation between sentiment and topic
words may be more reasonable for knowledge trans-
fer. RAP absorbs the advantages of the adaptive and
relational bootstrapping methods, thus can get the
best results in both lexicon extraction tasks.
We also observe that relational bootstrapping can
get better recall, but lower precision, compared to
adaptive bootstrapping. This is because relational
bootstrapping only utilizes the patterns to propagate
label information, which may cover more topic and
sentiment seeds, but include some noisy words. For
example, given two phases ?like the camera? and
?recommend the camera?, we can extract a pattern
?VB-dobj-NN?. However, by using this pattern and
the topic word ?camera?, we may extract ?take? as
a sentiment word from another phase ?take the cam-
era?, which is incorrect. The adaptive bootstrapping
method can utilize various features to make predic-
tions more precisely, which may have higher preci-
sion, but encounter the lower recall problem. For ex-
ample, ?flash? is not identified as a topic word in the
target product domain (camera domain). Our RAP
method can exploit both relationships between sen-
timent and topic words and part of labeled source
domain data for cross-domain lexicon extraction. It
can correctly identify the above two cases.
6.3.1 Parameter Sensitivity Study
In this section, we conduct experiments to study
the effect of different parameter settings. There are
several parameters in the framework: the number
of generated seeds r, the number of new candidates
k2 and the number of selections k in each iteration,
and the number of iterations M (? is empirically set
to 0.5 ). For the parameter k2, we just set it to a
large number (k2 = 100) such that have rich candi-
dates to build the bipartite graph. In the experiments
reported in the previous section, we set r = 20,
k1 = 10 and M = 50. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show
the results under varying values of r in the ?product
vs. movie? task. Observe that for sentiment word
extraction, the results of the proposed methods are
not sensitive to the values of r. While for the topic
word extraction, the proposed methods perform well
when r falls in the range from 15 to 20.

7 Application: Sentiment Classification
To further verify the usefulness of the lexicons ex-
tracted by the RAP method, we apply the extracted
sentiment lexicon for sentiment classification.
7.1 Experiment Setting
Our work is motivated by the work of (Pang and
Lee, 2004), which only used subjective sentences
for document-level sentiment classification, instead
of using all sentences. In this experiment, we only
use sentiment related words as features to represent
opinion documents for classification, instead of us-
ing all words. Our goal is compare the sentiment
lexicon constructed by the RAP method with other
general lexicons on the impact of for sentiment clas-
sification. The general lexicons used for comparison
are described in Table 4.
We use the dataset from (Blitzer et al, 2007) for
sentiment classification. It contains a collection of
product reviews from Amazon.com. The reviews are
about four product domains: books, dvds, electron-
ics and kitchen appliance. In each domain, there are
1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. To con-
struct domain specific sentiment lexicons, we apply
RAP on each product domain with the movie domain
described in Section 6.1 as the source domain. Fi-
nally, we use linear SVM as the classifier and the
classification accuracy as the evaluate criterion.

7.2 Experimental Results
Experimental results on sentiment classification are
shown in Table 5, where we denote ?All? using all
unigram and bigram features instead of using sub-
jective words. As we can see that a classifier trained
with features constructed by our RAP method per-
formance best in all domains. Note that the num-
ber of features (sentiment words) constructed by our
method is much smaller than that of all unigram
and bigram features, which can reduce the classi-
fier training time dramatically. These promising re-
sults imply that our RAP can be applied for senti-
ment classification effectively and efficiently.

8 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for
co-extraction of sentiment and topic lexicons across
domains where we have no labeled data in the tar-
get domain but have plenty of labeled data in an-
other domain. In the first stage, we propose a sim-
ple strategy to generate a few high-quality sentiment
and topic seeds for the target domain. In the second
stage, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive boot-
straPping (RAP) method to expand the seeds, which
can exploit the relationships between topic and opin-
ion words, and make use of part of useful source do-
main labeled data for help. Extensive experimental
results show our proposed method can extract pre-
cise sentiment and topic lexicons from the target do-
main. Furthermore, the extracted sentiment lexicon
can be applied to sentiment classification effectively.
In the future work, besides the heterogeneous
relationships between topic and sentiment words,
we intend to investigate the homogeneous relation-
ships among topic words and those among sentiment
words (Qiu et al, 2009) to further boost the perfor-
mance of RAP method. Furthermore, in our frame-
work, we do not identify the polarity of the extracted
sentiment lexicon. We also plan to embed this com-
ponent into our unified framework. Finally, it is also
interesting to exploit multi-domain knowledge (Li
and Zong, 2008; Bollegala et al, 2011) for cross-
domain lexicon extraction.
