Abstract 
Identification of complex clinical phenotypes 
among critically ill patients is a major chal-
lenge in clinical research. The overall research 
goal of our work is to develop automated ap-
proaches that accurately identify critical illness 
phenotypes to prevent the resource intensive 
manual abstraction approach. In this paper, we 
describe a text processing method that uses 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and su-
pervised text classification methods to identify 
patients who are positive for Acute Lung Inju-
ry (ALI) based on the information available in 
free-text chest x-ray reports. To increase the 
classification performance we enhanced the 
baseline unigram representation with bigram 
and trigram features, enriched the n-gram fea-
tures with assertion analysis, and applied sta-
tistical feature selection. We used 10-fold 
cross validation for evaluation and our best 
performing classifier achieved 81.70% preci-
sion (positive predictive value), 75.59% recall 
(sensitivity), 78.53% f-score, 74.61% negative 
predictive value, 76.80% specificity in identi-
fying patients with ALI. 
1 Introduction 
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical illness con-
sisting of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that is associ-
ated with pulmonary and non-pulmonary risk 
factors. ALI and its more severe form, acute res-
piratory distress syndrome (ARDS), represent a 
major health problem with an estimated preva-
lence of 7% of intensive care unit admissions 
(Rubenfeld et al, 2005) for which the appropri-
ate treatment is often instituted too late or not at 
all (Ferguson et al, 2005; Rubenfeld et al, 
2004). Early detection of ALI syndrome is essen-
tial for appropriate application of the only thera-
peutic intervention demonstrated to improve 
mortality in ALI, lung protective ventilation 
(LPV).   
The identification of ALI requires recognition 
of a precipitating cause, either due to direct lung 
injury from trauma or pneumonia or secondary to 
another insult such as sepsis, transfusion, or pan-
creatitis. The consensus criteria for ALI include 
the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on 
chest radiograph, representing non-cardiac pul-
monary edema as evidenced by the absence of 
left atrial hypertension (Pulmonary Capillary 
Wedge Pressure < 18 mmHg (2.4 kPa)) or ab-
sence of clinical evidence of congestive heart 
failure, and oxygenation impairment as defined 
by an arterial vs. inspired oxygen level ratio 
(PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg (40 kPa))  (Argitas et 
al., 1998; Dushianthan et al, 2011; Ranieri et al, 
2012).  
In this paper, we describe a text processing 
approach to identify patients who are positive for 
ALI based only on the free-text chest x-ray re-
ports. 
2 Related Work 
Several studies demonstrated the value of Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) in a variety of 
health care applications including phenotype ex-
traction from electronic medical records (EMR) 
(Demner-Dushman et al, 2009). Within this do-
main, chest x-ray reports have been widely stud-
ied to extract different types of pneumonia (Tep-
per et al, 2013; Elkin et al, 2008; Aronsky et al, 
2001; Fiszman et al, 2000). Chest x-ray reports 
have also been studied for ALI surveillance by 
other researchers. Two of the prior studies relied 
on rule-based keyword search approaches. He-
rasevich et al (2009) included a free text Boole-
an query containing trigger words bilateral, infil-
trate, and edema. Azzam et al (2009) used a 
more extensive list of trigger words and phrases 
to identify the presence of bilateral infiltrates and 
10
ALI. In another study, Solti et al (2009) repre-
sented the content of chest x-ray reports using 
character n-grams and applied supervised classi-
fication to identify chest x-ray reports consistent 
with ALI. In our work, different from prior re-
search, we proposed a fully statistical approach 
where (1) the content of chest x-ray reports was 
represented by token n-grams, (2) statistical fea-
ture selection was applied to select the most in-
formative features, and (3) assertion analysis was 
used to enrich the n-gram features. We also im-
plemented Azzam et al?s approach based on the 
information available in their paper and used it as 
a baseline to compare performance results of our 
approach to theirs. 
3 Methods  
The overall architecture of our text processing 
approach for ALI identification is illustrated in 
Figure 1. In the following sections, we will de-
scribe the main steps of the text processing ap-
proach as well as the annotated chest x-ray cor-
pus used in training and test. 
3.1 Chest X-ray Corpora 
To develop the ALI extractor, we created a cor-
pus composed of 1748 chest x-ray reports gener-
ated for 629 patients (avg number of re-
ports=2.78, min=1, max=3). Subjects for this 
corpus were derived from a cohort of intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients at Harborview Medical 
Center that has been described previously (Gla-
van et al, 2011). We selected 629 subjects who 
met the oxygenation criteria for ALI 
(PaO2/FiO2<300 mmHg) and then three con-
secutive chest radiographs were pulled from the 
radiology database. Three Critical Care Medicine 
specialists reviewed the chest radiograph images 
for each patient and annotated the radiographs as 
consistent (positive) or not-consistent (negative) 
with ALI. We assigned ALI status for each sub-
ject based on the number of physician raters call-
ing the chest radiographs consistent or not con-
sistent with ALI. Table 1 shows the number of 
physicians with agreement on the radiograph in-
terpretation. There were 254 patients in the posi-
tive set (2 or more physicians agreeing on ALI 
positive) and 375 patients in the negative set (2 
or more physicians agreeing on ALI negative). 
Table 1 includes the distribution of patients over 
the positive and negative classes at different 
agreement levels. We will refer to this annotated 
corpus as the development set in the remaining 
of the paper.  
For validation, we used a second dataset gen-
erated in a similar fashion to the development 
set.  We obtained chest radiographs for 55 sub-
jects that were admitted to ICU and who met ox-
ygenation criteria for ALI (1 radiograph and re-
port per patient). A specialized chest radiologist 
annotated each report for the presence of ALI. 
There were 21 patients in the positive set and 34 
in the negative set. We will refer to this corpus as 
the validation set in the remaining of the paper. 
The retrospective review of the reports in both 
corpora was approved by the University of 
Washington Human Subjects Committee of Insti-
tutional Review Board who waived the need for 
informed consent. 
3.2 Pre-processing ? Section and Sentence 
Segmentation 
Although radiology reports are in free text for-
mat, they are somewhat structured in terms of 
sections. We used a statistical section segmenta-
tion approach we previously built to identify the 
boundaries of the sections and their types in our 
corpus of chest x-ray reports (Tepper et al, 
2012). The section segmenter was trained and 
tested with a corpus of 100 annotated radiology 
reports and produced 93% precision, 91% recall 
and 92% f-score (5-fold cross validation).

After identifying the report sections, we used the 
OpenNLP 1  sentence chunker to identify the 
boundaries of sentences in the section bodies. 
This pre-processing step identified 8,659 sec-
tions and 15,890 sentences in 1,748 reports of the 
development set and 206 sections and 414 sen-
tences in 55 reports of the validation set. We 
used the section information to filter out the sec-
tions with clinician signatures (e.g., Interpreted 
By, Contributing Physicians, Signed By). We 
used the sentences to extract the assertion values 
associated with n-gram features as will be ex-
plained in a later section. 
3.3 Feature Selection 
Representing the information available in the 
free-text chest x-ray reports as features is critical 
in identifying patients with ALI. In our represen-
tation, we created one feature vector for each 
patient. We used unigrams as the baseline repre-
sentation. In addition, we used bigrams and tri-
grams as features. We observed that the chest x-
ray reports in our corpus are short and not rich in 
terms of medical vocabulary usage. Based on this 
observation, we decided not to include any medi-
cal knowledge-based features such as UMLS 
concepts or semantic types. Table 2 summarizes 
the number of distinct features for each feature 
type used to represent the 1,748 radiology reports 
for 629 patients. 
As can be seen from the table, for bigrams and 
trigrams, the feature set sizes is quite high. Fea-
ture selection algorithms have been successfully 
applied in text classification in order to improve 
the classification accuracy (Wenqian et al, 
2007). In previous work, we applied statistical 
feature selection to the problem of pneumonia 
detection from ICU reports (Bejan et al, 2012). 
By significantly reducing the dimensionality of 
the feature space, they improved the efficiency of 
the pneumonia classifiers and provided a better 
understanding of the data. 
We used statistical hypothesis testing to de-
termine whether there is an association between 
a given feature and the two categories of our 
problem (i.e, positive and negative ALI). Specif-
ically, we computed the ?2 statistics (Manning 
                                                 
1 OpenNLP. Available at: http://opennlp.apache.org/ 
and Schutze, 1999) which generated an ordering 
of features in the training set. We used 10-fold 
cross validation (development set) in our overall 
performance evaluation. Table 3 lists the top 15 
unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams ranked by ?2 
statistics in one of ten training sets we used in 
evaluation. As can be observed from the table, 
many of the features are closely linked to ALI. 
Once the features were ranked and their corre-
sponding threshold values (N) were established, 
we built a feature vector for each patient. Specif-
ically, given the subset of N relevant features 
extracted from the ranked list of features, we 
considered in the representation of a given pa-
tient?s feature vector only the features from the 
subset of relevant features that were also found 
in the chest x-ray reports of the patient. There-
fore, the size of the feature space is equal to the 
size of relevant features subset (N) whereas the 
length of each feature vector will be at most this 
value.  
3.4 Assertion Analysis 
We extended our n-gram representation with as-
sertion analysis. We built an assertion classifier 
(Bejan et al, 2013) based on the annotated cor-
pus of 2010 Integrating Biology and the Beside 
(i2b2) / Veteran?s Affairs (VA) NLP challenge 
(Uzuner et al, 2011). The 2010 i2b2/VA chal-
lenge introduced assertion classification as a

shared task, formulated such that each medical 
concept mentioned in a clinical report (e.g., 
asthma) is associated with a specific assertion 
category (present, absent, conditional, hypothet-
ical, possible, and not associated with the pa-
tient). We defined a set of novel features that 
uses the syntactic information encoded in de-
pendency trees in relation to special cue words 
for these categories. We also defined features to 
capture the semantics of the assertion keywords 
found in the corpus and trained an SVM multi-
class classifier with default parameter settings. 
Our assertion classifier outperformed the state-
of-the-art results and achieved 79.96% macro-
averaged F-measure and 94.23% micro-averaged 
F-measure on the i2b2/VA challenge test data.  
For each n-gram feature (e.g., pneumonia), we 
used the assertion classifier to determine whether 
it is present or absent based on contextual infor-
mation available in the sentence the feature ap-
peared in (e.g., Feature: pneumonia, Sentence: 
There is no evidence of pneumonia, congestive 
heart failure, or other acute process., Assertion: 
absent). We added the identified assertion value 
to the feature (e.g., pneumonia_absent). The fre-
quencies of each assertion type in our corpus are 
presented in Table 4. Because chest x-rays do not 
include family history, there were no instances of 
not associated with the patient. We treated the 
three assertion categories that express hedging 
(conditional, hypothetical, possible) as the pre-
sent category. 
3.5 Classification  
For our task of classifying ALI patients, we 
picked the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algo-
rithm due to its good performance in text classi-
fication tasks (Berger et al, 1996). In our exper-
iments, we used the MaxEnt implementation in a 
machine learning package called Mallet2.  
4 Results 
4.1 Metrics  
We evaluated the performance by using precision 
(positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), 
negative predictive value, specificity, f-score, 
and accuracy. We used 10-fold cross validation 
to measure the performance of our classifiers on 
the development set. We evaluated the best per-
forming classifier on the validation set.  
4.2 Experiments with Development Set  
We designed three groups of experiments to ex-
plore the effects of (1) different n-gram features, 
(2) feature selection, (3) assertion analysis of 
features on the classification of ALI patients. We 
defined two baselines to compare the perfor-
mance of our approaches. In the first baseline, 
we implemented the Azzam et. al.?s rule-based 
approach (2009). In the second baseline, we only 
represented the content of chest x-ray reports 
with unigrams. 
4.3 N-gram Experiments  
Table 5 summarizes the performance of n-gram 
features. When compared to the baseline uni-
gram representation, gradually adding bigrams 
(uni+bigram) and trigrams (uni+bi+trigram) to 
the baseline increased the precision and specifici-
ty by 4%. Recall and NPV remained the same. 
Azzam et. al.?s rule-based baseline generated 
higher recall but lower precision when compared 
to n-gram features. The best f-score (64.45%) 
was achieved with the uni+bi+trigram represen-
tation. 
4.4 Feature Selection Experiments  
To understand the effect of large feature space on 
classification performance, we studied how the 
performance of our system evolves for various 
threshold values (N) on the different combina-
tions of ?2 ranked unigram, bigram, and trigram 
features. Table 6 includes a subset of the results 
we collected for different values of N. As listed

in this table, for N=100, the unigram represen-
tation performed better than uni+bigram, 
uni+bi+trigram feature combinations; however, 
as N increased, the performance of 
uni+bi+trigram performed better, reaching the 
best f-score (78.53%) at N=800. When compared 
to the two defined baselines, the performance 
results of uni+bi+trigram at N=800 were signifi-
cantly better than those of the baselines.

sifier with uni+bi+trigram at N=800 in our ex-
periments. We applied assertion analysis to all 
800 features as well as only a small set of top 
ranked 10?k (1?k?5) features which were ob-
served to be closely related to ALI (e.g., diffuse, 
opacities, pulmonary edema). We hypothesized 
applying assertion analysis would inform the 
classifier on the presence and absence of those 
terms which would potentially decrease the false 
positive and negative counts. 
Table 7 summarizes the results of our experi-
ments. When we applied assertion analysis to all 
800 features, the performance slightly dropped 
when compared to the performance with no as-
sertion analysis. When assertion analysis applied 
to only top ranked features, the best f-score per-
formance was achieved with assertion analysis 
with top 30 features; however, it was still slightly 
lower than the f-score with no assertion analysis.  
The differences are not statistically significant. 
4.6 Experiments with Validation Set  
We used the validation set to explore the general-
izability of the proposed approach. To accom-
plish this we run the best performing classifier 
(uni+bi+trigram at N=800) and two defined 
baselines on the validation set. We re-trained the 
uni+bi+trigram at N=800 classifier and unigram 
baseline on the complete development set. 
Table 8 includes the performance results. The 
second baseline with unigrams performed the 
best and Azzam et. al.?s baseline performed the 
worst in identifying the patients with ALI in the 
validation set. 
5 Discussion 
Our best system achieved an f-score of 78.53 
(precision=81.70, recall=75.59) on the develop-
ment set. While the result is encouraging and 
significantly better than the f-score of a previous-
ly published system (f-score=62.23, preci-
sion=51.27, recall=79.13), there is still room for 
improvement. 
There are several important limitations to our 
current development dataset. First, the annotators 
who are pulmonary care specialists used only the 
x-ray images to annotate the patients. However, 
the classifiers were trained based on the features 
extracted from the radiologists? free-text inter-
pretation of the x-ray images. In one false posi-
tive case, the radiologist has written ?Bilateral 
diffuse opacities, consistent with pulmonary 
edema. Bibasilar atelectasis.? in the chest x-ray 
report, however all three pulmonary care special-
ists annotated the case as negative based on their 
interpretation of images. Because the report con-
sisted of many very strong features indicative of 
ALI, our classifier falsely identified the patient 
as positive with a very high prediction probabil-
ity 0.96. Second, although three annotators anno-
tated the development set, there was full agree-
ment on 42.12% (107/254) of the positive pa-
tients and 45.33% (170/375) of the negative pa-
tients. Table 9 includes the false positive and 
negative statistics of the best performing classifi-
er (uni+bi+trigrams at N=800). As can be seen 
from the table, the classifier made more mistakes 
on patients where the annotator agreement was 
not perfect. The classifier predicted 13 of the 28 
false positives and 23 of the 39 false negatives 
with probabilities higher than 0.75. When we 
investigated the reports of those 13 false posi-
tives, we observed that the radiologists used 
many very strong ALI indicative features (e.g., 
diffuse lung opacities, low lung volumes) to de-
scribe the images. On the contrary, radiologists 
did not use as many ALI indicative features in 
the reports of 23 false negative cases. 
In our experiments on the development set, we 
demonstrated the positive impact of statistical 
feature selection on the overall classification per-
formance. We achieved the best f-score, when 
we used only 2.67% (800/29,914) of the com-
plete n-gram feature space. We enriched the 
highly ranked features with assertion analysis. 
However, unlike feature selection, assertion 
analysis did not improve the overall perfor-
mance. To explore the reasons, we analyzed re-
ports from our corpus and found out that the cur-
rent six assertion classes (present, absent, condi-
tional, hypothetical, possible) were not sufficient 
to capture true meaning in many cases. For ex-
ample, our assertion classifier assigned the class 
present to the bigram bibasilar opacities based 
on the sentence ?There are bibasilar opacities 
that are unchanged?. Although present was the 
correct assignment for bibasilar opacities, the 
more important piece of information was the 
change of state in bibasilar opacities for ALI 
diagnosis. X-rays describe a single snapshot of 
time but the x-ray report narrative makes explicit

or, more often implicit references to a previous 
x-ray. In this way, the sequence of x-ray reports 
is used not only to assess a patient?s health at a 
moment in time but also to monitor the change. 
We recently defined a schema to annotate change 
of state for clinical events in chest x-ray reports 
(Vanderwende et al, 2013). We will use this an-
notation schema to create an annotated corpus 
for training models to enrich the assertion fea-
tures for ALI classification.  
The results on the validation set revealed that 
the classification performance degraded signifi-
cantly when training and test data do not come 
from the same dataset. There are multiple rea-
sons to this effect. First, the two datasets had dif-
ferent language characteristics. Although both 
development and validation sets included chest 
x-ray reports, only 2,488 of the 3,305 (75.28%) 
n-gram features extracted from the validation set 
overlapped with the 29,914 n-gram features ex-
tracted from the development set. We suspect 
that this is the main reason why our best per-
forming classifier with feature selection trained 
on the development set did not perform as well 
as the unigram baseline on the validation set. 
Second, the validation set included only 55 pa-
tients and each patient had only one chest x-ray 
report unlike the development set where each 
patient had 2.78 reports on the average. In other 
words, the classifiers trained on the development 
set with richer content made poor predictions on 
the validation set with more restricted content. 
Third, because the number of patients in the val-
idation set was too small, each false positive and 
negative case had a huge impact on the overall 
performance. 
6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we described a text processing ap-
proach to identify patients with ALI from the 
information available in their corresponding free-
text chest x-ray reports. To increase the classifi-
cation performance, we (1) enhanced the base-
line unigram representation with bigram and tri-
gram features, (2) enriched the n-gram features 
with assertion analysis, and (3) applied statistical 
feature selection. Our proposed methodology of 
ranking all the features using statistical hypothe-
sis testing and selecting only the most relevant 
ones for classification resulted in significantly 
improving the performance of a previous system 
for ALI identification. The best performing clas-
sifier achieved 81.70% precision (positive pre-
dictive value), 75.59% recall (sensitivity), 
78.53% f-score, 74.61% negative predictive val-
ue, 76.80% specificity in identifying patients 
with ALI when using the uni+bi+trigram repre-
sentation at N=800. Our experiments showed 
that assertion values did not improve the overall 
performance. For future work, we will work on 
defining new semantic features that will enhance 
the current assertion definition and capture the 
change of important events in radiology reports.
