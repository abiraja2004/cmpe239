Abstract
In this paper we investigate a new source of
information for syntactic category acquisition:
sentence type (question, declarative, impera-
tive). Sentence type correlates strongly with
intonation patterns in most languages; we hy-
pothesize that these intonation patterns are a
valuable signal to a language learner, indicat-
ing different syntactic patterns. To test this hy-
pothesis, we train a Bayesian Hidden Markov
Model (and variants) on child-directed speech.
We first show that simply training a separate
model for each sentence type decreases perfor-
mance due to sparse data. As an alternative, we
propose two new models based on the BHMM
in which sentence type is an observed variable
which influences either emission or transition
probabilities. Both models outperform a stan-
dard BHMM on data from English, Cantonese,
and Dutch. This suggests that sentence type
information available from intonational cues
may be helpful for syntactic acquisition cross-
linguistically.
1 Introduction
Children acquiring the syntax of their native language
have access to a large amount of contextual informa-
tion. Acquisition happens on the basis of speech, and
the acoustic signal carries rich prosodic and intona-
tional information that children can exploit. A key task
is to separate the acoustic properties of a word from the
underlying sentence intonation. Infants become attuned
to the pragmatic and discourse functions of utterances
as signalled by intonation extremely early; in this they
are helped by the fact that intonation contours of child
and infant directed speech are especially well differen-
tiated between sentence types (Stern et al, 1982; Fer-
nald, 1989). Children learn to use appropriate intona-
tional melodies to communicate their own intentions at
the one word stage, before overt syntax develops (Snow
and Balog, 2002).
It follows that sentence type information (whether a
sentence is declarative, imperative, or a question), as
signaled by intonation, is readily available to children
by the time they start to acquire syntactic categories.
Sentence type also has an effect on sentence structure
in many languages (most notably on word order), so
we hypothesise that sentence type is a useful cue for
syntactic category learning. We test this hypothesis by
incorporating sentence type information into an unsu-
pervised model of part of speech tagging.
We are unaware of previous work investigating the
usefulness of this kind of information for syntactic
category acquisition. In other domains, intonation has
been used to identify sentence types as a means of im-
proving speech recognition language models. Specifi-
cally, (Taylor et al, 1998) found that using intonation
to recognize dialogue acts (which to a significant extent
correspond to sentence types) and then using a special-
ized language model for each type of dialogue act led
to a significant decrease in word error rate.
In the remainder of this paper, we first present the
Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (BHMM; Goldwater
and Griffiths (2007)) that is used as the baseline model
of category acquisition, as well as our extensions to
the model, which incorporate sentence type informa-
tion. We then discuss the distinctions in sentence type
that we used and our evaluation measures, and finally
our experimental results. We perform experiments on
corpora in four different languages: English, Spanish,
Cantonese, and Dutch. Our results on Spanish show no
difference between the baseline and the models incor-
porating sentence type, possibly due to the small size of
the Spanish corpus. Results on all other corpora show
a small improvement in performance when sentence
type is included as a cue to the learner. These cross-
linguistic results suggest that sentence type may be a
useful source of information to children acquiring syn-
tactic categories.
2 BHMM Models
2.1 Standard BHMM
We use a Bayesian HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths,
2007) as our baseline model. Like a standard trigram
HMM, the BHMM assumes that the probability of tag
ti depends only on the previous two tags, and the proba-
bility of word wi depends only on ti. This can be written
as
ti|ti?1 = t, ti?2 = t
?,?(t,t
?) ? Mult(?(t,t
?)) (1)
wi|ti = t,?
(t) ? Mult(?(t)) (2)
where ?(t,t
?) are the parameters of the multinomial dis-
tribution over following tags given previous tags (t, t ?)
1
and ?(t) are the parameters of the distribution over out-
puts given tag t. The BHMM assumes that these param-
eters are in turn drawn from symmetric Dirichlet priors
with parameters ? and ?, respectively:
?(t,t
?)|? ? Dirichlet(?) (3)
?(t)|? ? Dirichlet(?) (4)
Using these Dirichlet priors allows the multinomial dis-
tributions to be integrated out, leading to the following
predictive distributions:
P(ti|t?i,?) =
C(ti?2, ti?1, ti)+?
C(ti?2, ti?1)+T?
(5)
P(wi|ti, t?i,w?i,?) =
C(ti,wi)+?
C(ti)+Wti?
(6)
where t?i = t1 . . . ti?1, w?i = w1 . . .wi?1, C(ti?2, ti?1, ti)
and C(ti,wi) are the counts of the trigram (ti?2, ti?1, ti)
and the tag-word pair (ti,wi) in t?i and w?i, T is the
size of the tagset, and Wti is the number of word types
emitted by ti.
Based on these predictive distributions, (Goldwa-
ter and Griffiths, 2007) develop a Gibbs sampler for
the model, which samples from the posterior distri-
bution over tag sequences t given word sequences w,
i.e., P(t|w,?,?)? P(w|t,?)P(t|?). This is done by us-
ing Equations 5 and 6 to iteratively resample each tag
ti given the current values of all other tags.1 The re-
sults show that the BHMM with Gibbs sampling per-
forms better than the standard HMM using expectation-
maximization. In particular, the Dirichlet priors in the
BHMM constrain the model towards sparse solutions,
i.e., solutions in which each tag emits a relatively small
number of words, and in which a tag transitions to few
following tags. This type of model constraint allows
the model to find solutions which correspond to true
syntactic parts of speech (which follow such a sparse,
Zipfian distribution), unlike the uniformly-sized clus-
ters found by standard maximum likelihood estimation
using EM.
In the experiments reported below, we use the Gibbs
sampler described by (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007)
for the BHMM, and modify it as necessary for our own
extended models. We also follow (Goldwater and Grif-
fiths, 2007) in using Metropolis-Hastings sampling for
the hyperparameters, which are inferred automatically
in all experiments. A separate ? parameter is inferred
for each tag.
2.2 BHMM with Sentence Types
We wish to add a sentence type feature to each time-
step in the HMM, signalling the current sentence type.
We treat sentence type (s) as an observed variable, on
the assumption that it is observed via intonation or
1Slight corrections need to be made to Equation 5 to ac-
count for sampling tags from the middle of the sequence
rather than from the end; these are given in (Goldwater and
Griffiths, 2007) and are followed in our own samplers.

served variable on tag transitions (but not emissions).
punctuation features (not part of our model), and these
features are informative enough to reliably distinguish
sentence types (as speech recognition tasks have found
to be the case, see Section 1).
In the BHMM, there are two obvious ways that sen-
tence type could be incorporated into the generative
model: either by affecting the transition probabilities
or by affecting the emission probabilities. The first case
can be modeled by adding si as a conditioning variable
when choosing ti, replacing line 1 from the BHMM
definition with the following:
ti|si = s, ti?1 = t, ti?2 = t
?,?(t,t
?) ? Mult(?(s,t,t
?)) (7)
We will refer to this model, illustrated graphically in
Figure 1, as the BHMM-T. It assumes that the distribu-
tion over ti depends not only on the previous two tags,
but also on the sentence type, i.e., that different sen-
tence types tend to have different sequences of tags.
In contrast, we can add si as a conditioning variable
for wi by replacing line 2 from the BHMM with
wi|si = s, ti = t,?
(t) ? Mult(?(s,t)) (8)
This model, the BHMM-E, assumes that different sen-
tence types tend to have different words emitted from
the same tag.
The predictive distributions for these models are
given in Equations 9 (BHMM-T) and 10 (BHMM-E):
P(ti|t?i,si,?) =
C(ti?2, ti?1, ti,si)+?
C(ti?2, ti?1,si)+T?
(9)
P(wi|ti,si,?) =
C(ti,wi,si)+?
C(ti,si)+Wti?
(10)
Of course, we can also create a third new model,
the BHMM-B, in which sentence type is used to con-
dition both transition and emission probabilities. This
model is equivalent to training a separate BHMM on
each type of sentence (with shared hyperparameters).
Note that introducing the extra conditioning variable
in these models has the consequence of splitting the
counts for transitions, emissions, or both. The split dis-
tributions will therefore be estimated using less data,
which could actually degrade performance if sentence
type is not a useful variable.
2
Our prediction is that sentence type is more likely
to be useful as a conditioning variable for transition
probabilities (BHMM-T) than for emission probabili-
ties (BHMM-E). For example, the auxiliary inversion
in questions is likely to increase the probability of
the AUX? PRO transition, compared to declaratives.
Knowing that the sentence is a question may also af-
fect emission probabilities, e.g., it might increase the
probability the word you given a PRO and decrease the
probability of I; one would certainly expect wh-words
to have much higher probability in wh-questions than
in declaratives. However, many other variables also af-
fect the particular words used in a sentence (princi-
pally, the current semantic and pragmatic context). We
expect that sentence type plays a relatively small role
compared to these other factors. The ordering of tags
within an utterance, on the other hand, is principally
constrained by sentences type (especially in the short
and grammatically simple utterances found in child-
directed speech).
3 Sentence Types
We experiment with a number of sentence-type cate-
gories, leading to increasingly fine grained distinctions.
The primary distinction is between questions (Q) and
declaratives (D). Questions are marked by punctuation
(in writing) or by intonation (in speech), as well as by
word order or other morpho-syntactic markers in many
languages.
Questions may be separated into categories, most
notably wh-questions and yes/no-questions. Many lan-
guages (including several English dialects) have dis-
tinct intonation patterns for wh- and yes/no-questions
(Hirst and Cristo, 1998).
Imperatives are a separate type from declaratives,
with distinct word order and intonation patterns.
Declaratives may be further subdivided into frag-
ments and full sentences. We define fragments as ut-
terances without a verb (including auxiliary verbs).
As an alternate sentence-level feature to sentence
type, we use length. Utterances are classified accord-
ing to their length, as either shorter or longer than av-
erage. Shorter utterances are more likely to be frag-
ments and may have distinct syntactic patterns. How-
ever these patterns are likely to be less strong than in
the above type-based types. In effect this condition is
a pseudo-baseline, testing the effects of less- or non-
informative sentence features on our proposed models.
4 Evaluation Measures
Evaluation of fully unsupervised part of speech tagging
is known to be problematic, due to the fact that the
part of speech clusters found by the model are unla-
beled, and do not automatically correspond to any of
the gold standard part of speech categories. We report
three evaluation measures in our experiments, in order
to avoid the weaknesses inherent in any single measure
and in an effort to be comparable to previous work.
Matched accuracy (MA), also called many-to-one
accuracy, is a commonly used measure for evaluating
unlabeled clusterings in part of speech tagging. Each
unlabeled cluster is given the label of the gold category
with which it shares the most members. Given these la-
bels, accuracy can be measured as usual, as the percent-
age of tokens correctly labeled. Note that multiple clus-
ters may have the same label if several clusters match
the same gold standard category. This can lead to a de-
generate solution if the model is allowed an unbounded
number of categories, in which each word is in a sepa-
rate cluster. In less extreme cases, it makes comparing
MA across clustering results with different numbers of
clusters difficult. Another serious issue with MA is the
?problem of matching? (Meila, 2007): matched accu-
racy only evaluates whether or not the items in the clus-
ter match the majority class label. The non-matching
items within a cluster might all be from a second gold
class, or they might be from many different classes. In-
tuitively, the former clustering should be evaluated as
better, but matched accuracy is the same for both clus-
terings.
Variation of Information (VI) (Meila, 2007) is a
clustering evaluation measure that avoids the match-
ing problem. It measures the amount of information
lost and gained when moving between two clusterings.
More precisely:
V I(C,K) = H(C)+H(K)?2I(C,K)
= H(C|K)+H(K|C)
A lower score implies closer clusterings, since each
clustering has less information not shared with the
other: two identical clusterings have a VI of zero. How-
ever, VI?s upper bound is dependent on the maximum
number of clusters in C or K, making it difficult to com-
pare clustering results with different numbers of clus-
ters.
As a third, and, in our view, most informative
measure, we use V-measure (VM; Rosenberg and
Hirschberg (2007)). Like VI, VM uses the conditional
entropy of clusters and categories to evaluate cluster-
ings. However, it also has the useful characteristic of
being analogous to the precision and recall measures
commonly used in NLP. Homogeneity, the precision
analogue, is defined as
V H = 1?
H(C|K)
H(C)
.
VH is highest when the distribution of categories
within each cluster is highly skewed towards a small
number of categories, such that the conditional entropy
is low. Completeness (recall) is defined symmetrically
to VH as:
VC = 1?
H(K|C)
H(K)
.
VC measures the conditional entropy of the clusters
within each gold standard category, and is highest if
each category maps to a single cluster so that each

model cluster completely contains a category. The V-
measure VM is simply the harmonic mean of VH and
VC, analogous to traditional F-score. Unlike MA and
VI, VM is invariant with regards to both the number of
items in the dataset and to the number of clusters used,
and consequently it is best suited for comparing results
across different corpora.
5 English experiments
5.1 Corpora
We use the Eve corpus (Brown, 1973) and the
Manchester corpus (Theakston et al, 2001) from the
CHILDES collection (MacWhinney, 2000). The Eve
corpus is a longitudinal study of a single US Ameri-
can child from the age of 1.5 to 2.25 years, whereas
the Manchester corpus follows a cohort of 12 British
children from the ages of 2 to 3. Using both corpora
ensures that any effect is not due to a particular child,
and is not specific to a type of English.
From both corpora we remove all utterances spoken
by a child; the remaining utterances are nearly exclu-
sively child-directed speech (CDS). We use the full Eve
corpus and a similarly sized subset of the Manchester
corpus, consisting of the first 70 CDS utterances from
each file. Files from the chronological middle of each
corpus are set aside for development and testing (Eve:
file 10 for testing, 11 for dev; Manchester: file 17 from
each child for testing, file 16 for dev).
Both corpora have been tagged using the relatively
rich CHILDES tagset, which we collapse to a smaller
set of thirteen tags: adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries,
conjunctions, determiners, infinitival-to, nouns, nega-
tion, participles, prepositions, pronouns, verbs and
other (communicators, interjections, fillers and the
like). wh-words are tagged as adverbs (why,where,
when and how, or pronouns (who and the rest).
Table 1 show the sizes of the training sets, and
the breakdown of sentence types within them. Each
sentence type can be identified using a distinguish-
ing characteristic. Sentence-final punctuation is used to
differentiate between questions and declaratives; wh-
questions are then further differentiated by the pres-
ence of a wh-word. Imperatives are separated from the
declaratives by a heuristic (since CHILDES does not
have an imperative verb tag): if an utterance includes
a base verb within the first two words, without a pro-
noun proceeding it (with the exception of you, as in
you sit down right now), the utterance is coded as an
imperative. Fragments are also identified using the tag
annotations, namely by the lack of a verb or auxiliary
tag in an utterance.
The CHILDES annotation guide specifies that the
question mark is to be used with any utterance with ?fi-
nal rising contour?, even if syntactically the utterance
might appear to be a declarative or exclamation. The
question category consequently includes echo ques-
tions (Finger stuck?) and non-inverted questions (You
want me to have it?).
5.2 Inference and Evaluation Procedure
Unsupervised models do not suffer from overfitting,
so generally it is thought unnecessary to use separate
training and testing data, with results being reported
on the entire set of input data. However, there is still
a danger, in the course of developing a model, of over-
fitting in the sense of becoming too finely attuned to a
particular set of input data. To avoid this, we use sep-
arate test and development sets. The BHMM is trained
on (train+dev) or (train+test), but evaluation scores are
computed based on the dev or test portions of the data
only. 2
We run the Gibbs sampler for 2000 iterations, with
hyperparameter resampling and simulated annealing.
Each iteration produces an assignment of tags to the
tokens in the corpus; the final iteration is used for eval-
uation purposes. Since Gibbs sampling is a stochas-
tic algorithm, we run all models multiple times (three,
except where stated otherwise) and report average val-
ues for all evaluation measures, as well as confidence
intervals. We run our experiments using a variety of
sentence type features, ranging from the coarse ques-
tion/declarative (Q/D) distinction to the full five types.
For reasons of space we do not report all results here,
instead confining ourselves to representative samples.
5.3 BHMM-B: Type-specific Sub-Models
When separate sub-models are used for each sen-
tence type, as in the BHMM-B, where both transition
and emission probabilities are conditioned on sentence
type, the hidden states (tags) in each sub-model do
not correspond to each other, e.g., a hidden state 9 in
one sub-model is not the same state 9 in another sub-
model. Consequently, when evaluating the tagged out-
put, each sentence type must be evaluated separately
(otherwise the evaluation would equate declaratives-
tag-9 with questions-tag-9).
2The results presented in this paper are all evaluated on
the dev set; preliminary test set results on the Eve corpus
show the same patterns.

Table 2 shows representative results for the W/Q/D
condition on the Manchester corpus, separated into wh-
questions, other questions, and declaratives. For each
sentence type, the BHMM-B performs significantly
worse than the BHMM. The wh-questions sub-model,
which is trained on the smallest subset of the input cor-
pus, performs the worst across all measures except VI.
This suggests that lack of data is why these sub-models
perform worse than the standard model.
5.4 BHMM-E: Type-specific Emissions
Having demonstrated that using entirely separate sub-
models does not improve tagging performance, we turn
to the BHMM-E, in which emission probability distri-
butions are sentence-type specific, but transition prob-
abilities are shared between all sentence types.
The results in Table 3 show that BHMM-E does re-
sult in slightly better tagging performance as evaluated
by VI (lower VI is better) and VM and its components.
Matched accuracy does not capture this same trend. In-
specting the clusters found by the model, we find that
clusters for the most part do match gold categories. The
tokens that do not fall into the highest matching gold
categories are not distributed randomly, however; for
instance, nouns and pronouns often end up in the same
cluster. VI and VM capture these secondary matches
while MA does not. Some small gold categories (e.g.
the single word infinitival-to and negation-not cate-
gories) are often merged by the model into a single
cluster, with the result that MA considers nearly half
the cluster as misclassified.
The largest increase in performance with regards to
the standard BHMM is obtained by adding the distinc-
tion between declaratives and questions. Thereafter,
adding the wh-question, fragment and imperative sen-
tence types does not worsen performance, but also does
not significantly improve performance on any measure.
5.5 BHMM-T: Type-specific Transitions
Lastly, the BHMM-T shares emission probabilities
among sentence types and uses sentence type specific
transition probabilities.
Results comparing the standard BHMM with the
BHMM-T with sentence-type-specific transition prob-
abilities are presented in Table 4. Once again, VM
and VI show a clear trend: the models using sen-
tence type information outperform both the standard
BHMM and models splitting according to utterance
length (shorter/longer than average). MA shows no sig-
nificant difference in performance between the differ-
ent models (aside from clearly showing that utterance
length is an unhelpful feature). The fact that the MA
measure shows no clear change in performance is likely
a fault of the measure itself; as explained above, VI and
VM take into account the distribution of words within
a category, which MA does not.
As with the BHMM-E, the improvements to VM and
VI are obtained by distinguishing between questions
and declaratives, and then between wh- and other ques-
tions. Both of these distinctions are marked by intona-
tion in English. In contrast, distinguishing fragments
and imperatives, which are less easily detected by in-
tonation, provides no obvious benefit in any case. Us-
ing sentence length as a feature degrades performance
considerably, confirming that improvements in perfor-
mance are due to sentence types capturing useful infor-
mation about the tagging task, and not simply due to
splitting the input in some arbitrary way.
One reason for the improvement when adding the
wh-question type is that the models are learning to
identify and cluster the wh-words in particular. If we
evaluate the wh-words separately, VM rises from 32.3

in the baseline BHMM to 41.5 in the W/Q/D condition
with the BHMM-T model and 46.8 with the BHMM-
E model. Performance for the non-wh-words also im-
proves in the W/Q/D condition, albeit less dramati-
cally: from 61.1 in the baseline BHMM to 63.6 with
BHMM-T and 62.0 with BHMM-E. The wh-question
type enables the models to pick up on the defining char-
acteristics of these sentences, namely wh-words.
We predicted the sentence-type specific transition
probabilities in the BHMM-T to be more useful than
the sentence-type specific emission probabilities in the
BHMM-E. The BHMM-T does perform slightly better
than the BHMM-E, however, the effect is small. Word
or tag order may be the most overt difference between
questions and declaratives in English, but word choice,
especially the use of wh-words varies sufficiently be-
tween sentence types for sentence-type specific emis-
sion probabilities to be equally useful.
6 Crosslinguistic Experiments
In the previous section we found that sentence type
information improved syntactic categorisation in En-
glish. In this section, we evaluate the BHMM?s perfor-
mance on a range of languages other than English, and
investigate whether sentence type information is use-
ful across languages. To our knowledge this is the first
application of the BHMM to non-English data.
Nearly all human languages distinguish between
yes/no-questions and declaratives in intonation; ques-
tions are most commonly marked by rising intonation
(Hirst and Cristo, 1998). wh-questions do not always
have a distinct intonation type, but they are signalled
by the presence of members of the small class of wh-
words.
The CHILDES collection includes tagged corpora
for Spanish and Cantonese: the Ornat corpus (Ornat,
1994) and the Lee Wong Leung (LWL) corpus (Lee
et al, 1994) respectively. To cover a greater variety of
word order patterns, a Dutch corpus of adult dialogue
(not CDS) is also tested. We describe each corpus in
turn below; Table 5 describes their relative sizes.

6.1 Spanish
The Ornat corpus is a longitudinal study of a single
child between the ages of one and a half and nearly
four years, consisting of 17 files. Files 08/09 are used
testing/development.
We collapse the Spanish tagset used in the Ornat cor-
pus in a similar fashion to the English corpora. There
are 11 tags in the final set: adjectives, adverbs, con-
juncts, determiners, nouns, prepositions, pronouns, rel-
ative pronouns, auxiliaries, verbs, and other.
Spanish wh-questions are formed by fronting the
wh-word (but without the auxiliary verbs added in
English); yes/no-questions involve raising the main
verb (again without the auxiliary inversion in English).
Spanish word order in declaratives is generally freer
than English word order. Verb- and object-fronting is
more common, and pronouns may be dropped (since
verbs are marked for gender and number).
6.2 Cantonese
The LWL corpus consists of transcripts from a set of
children followed over the course of a year, totalling
128 files. The ages of the children are not matched, but
they range between one and three years old. Our train-
ing set consists of the first 500 utterances of all train-
ing files, in order to create a data set of similar size as
the other corpora used. Files from children aged two
6
years and five months are used as the test set; files from
two years and six months are the development set files
(again, the first 500 utterances from each of these make
up the test/dev corpus).
The tagset used in the LWL is larger than the En-
glish corpus. It consists of 20 tags: adjective, ad-
verb, aspectual marker, auxiliary or modal verb, clas-
sifier, communicator, connective, determiners, genitive
marker, preposition or locative, noun, negation, pro-
nouns, quantifiers, sentence final particle, verbs, wh-
words, foreign word, and other. We remove all sen-
tences that are encoded as being entirely in English but
leave single foreign, mainly English, words (generally
nouns) in a Cantonese context.
Cantonese follows the same basic SVO word order
as English, but with a much higher frequency of topic-
raising. Questions are not marked by different word or-
der. Instead, particles are inserted to signal questioning.
These particles can signal either a yes/no-question or a
wh-question; in the case of wh-questions they replace
the item being questioned (e.g., playing-you what?),
without wh-raising as in English or Spanish. Despite
the use of tones in Cantonese, questions are marked
with rising final intonation.
6.3 Dutch
The Corpus of Spoken Dutch (CGN) contains Dutch
spoken in a variety of settings. We use the ?spontaneous
conversation? component, consisting of 925 files, since
it is the most similar to CDS. However, the utterances
are longer, and there are far fewer questions, especially
wh-questions (see Table 5).
The corpus does not have any meaningful timeline,
so we designated all files with numbers ending in 0 as
test files and files ending in 9 as dev files. The first
60 utterances from each file were used, to create train-
ing/test/dev sets similar in size to the other corpora.
The coarse CGN tagset consists of 11 tags, which
we used directly: adjective, adverb, conjunction, deter-
miner, interjection, noun, number, pronoun/determiner,
preposition, and verb.
Dutch follows verb-second word order in main
clauses and SOV word order in embedded clauses.
Yes/no-questions are created by verb-fronting, as in
Spanish. wh-questions involve a wh-word at the begin-
ning of the utterance followed by the verb in second
position.
6.4 Results
We trained standard BHMM, BHMM-T and BHMM-E
models in the same manner as with the English corpora.
Given the poor performance of the BHMM-B, we did
not test it here.
Due to inconsistent annotation and lack of familiar-
ity with the languages we tested only two sentence type
distinctions, Q/D and W/Q/D. Punctuation was used
to distinguish between questions and declaratives. wh-
questions were identified by using a list of wh-words
for Spanish and Dutch; for Cantonese we relied on the
wh-word tag annotation.
Results are shown in Table 6. Since the corpora
are different sizes and use tagsets of varying sizes, VI
and MA results are not comparable between corpora.
VM (and VC and VH) are more robust, but even so
cross-corpora comparisons should be made carefully.
The English corpora VM scores are significantly higher
(around 10 points higher) than the non-English corpora
scores.
In Cantonese and Dutch, the W/Q/D BHMM-T
model performs best; in both cases significantly bet-
ter than the BHMM. In Cantonese, the separation of
wh-questions improves tagging significantly in both the
BHMM-T and BHMM-E models, whereas simply sep-
arating questions and declaratives helps far less. In
the Dutch corpus, wh-questions improved only in the
BHMM-T, not in the BHMM-E.
The Spanish models have higher variance, due to the
small size of the corpus. Due to the high variance, there
are no significant differences between any of the con-
ditions; it is also difficult to spot a trend.
7 Future Work
We have shown sentence type information to be use-
ful for syntactic tagging. However, the BHMM-E and
BHMM-T models are successful in part however be-
cause they also share information as well as split it;
the completely split BHMM-B does not perform well.
Many aspects of tagging do not change significantly
between sentence types. Within a noun phrase, the or-
dering of determiners and nouns is the same whether
it is in a question or an imperative, and to a large ex-
tent the determiners and nouns used will be the same
as well. Learning these patterns over as much input as
possible is essential. Therefore, the next step in this line
of work will be to add a general (corpus-level) model
alongside type-specific models. Ideally, the model will
learn when to use the type-specific model (when tag-
ging the beginning of questions, for instance) and when
to use the general model (when tagging NPs). Such a
model would make use of sentence-type information in
a better way, hopefully leading to further improvements
in performance. A further, more sophisticated model
could learn the useful sentence types distinctions auto-
matically, perhaps forgoing the poorly performing im-
perative or fragment types we tested here in favor of a
more useful type we did not identify.
8 Conclusions
We set out to investigate a hitherto unused source of
information for models of syntactic category learning,
namely intonation and its correlate, sentence type. We
showed that this information is in fact useful, and in-
cluding it in a Bayesian Hidden Markov Model im-
proved unsupervised tagging performance.
We found tagging performance increases if sentence
type information is used to generate either transition
probabilities or emission probabilities in the BHMM.
However, we found that performance decreases if sen-
tence type information is used to generate both transi-

tion and emission probabilities (which is equivalent to
training a separate BHMM for each sentence type).
To test the generality of our findings, we carried out a
series of cross-linguistic experiments, integrating sen-
tence type information in unsupervised tagging mod-
els for Spanish, Cantonese, and Dutch. The results for
Cantonese and Dutch mirrored those for English, show-
ing a small increase in tagging performance for models
that included sentence type information. For Spanish,
no improvement was observed.
