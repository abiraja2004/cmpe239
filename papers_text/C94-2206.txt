1 In t roduct ion  
This paper presents an incremental construction 
method of a lex iea l  t ransducer  (LT) for Korean. 
A lexical transducer, lirst described by Karttunen, 
Kaplan, and Zaencn (KKZ) (Karttunen, 1992a), is 
a speeialized tinite state transducer (FST) that maps 
canonical citation forms of words and morphological 
categories to infh.'cted surface forms, and vice versa. 
l;\]'s have many advantages for stemming, morpholog- 
ical analysis, and generation. They are 
(i) b ld i rec t lonah  the same structure (:an be used for 
stemming and generation. 
( i i )  ett ic ient:  the recognition and generation of word 
tbrms does not require the application of any mor- 
phological rules at runtime. 
LTs for li',nglish and French have been built at Xe- 
rox PARC within a t}amework nown as two- level  
Inorpho logy  (Koskenniemi, 1983). As described by 
KKZ(Karttuneu, 1992a), this can be done in three 
steps: (i) we construct a simple flnite-state automa 
ton (LA) that defines all valid lexical tbrms (LFs) of 
the language.. A I,F is a eoncateuation of stems and 
morphemes in their canonical dictionary representa- 
tion. (ii) We describe morphological alternations by 
means of two-lew,.1 rules(Koskeuniemi, 1983; Kin't- 
1 '\['his p~per was partially supporl;ed by t(orcan Science and 
h\]nginecring l,'onndation. 
tunen, 1993), compile the rules to finite-state trans- 
ducers, and intersect hem to form a single rule trans- 
ducer (RSF). (iii) We merge the LA with the ffF by 
composition producing the 1/\[' that has on its lexi- 
cal side every valid lexical form of the language and 
on the surface side the corresponding realization as 
determined by the morphological alternations of the 
language. 
KKZ argued that for l!'rench, it, was best to divide 
step (ii) into two stages. A three-level description was 
required to give a linguistically satisfactory account of 
the plural lbrmation of eompomld nouns .  KKZ opted 
for two cascading two-level rule systems thai; are corn- 
piled separately, then intersected laterally and finally 
composed to a single RT. 
The task of building a morphological analyzer for ~t 
language such as Korean or ,I apanese is a much higher 
challenge than it is for l';uglish and French. A Ko- 
re.an verb may have more than fifty thousand inflected 
forms. = The Korean writing system (l\]anaul) does 
not consistently distinguish be.tween single and eom- 
pound nouns. Because llangul uses syllabic charac- 
ters, changes in syllable strucl, ure are directly reflected 
in the. orthography. 
Because o\[' the complexity of the morphological al- 
ternations in Korean, it; is very difficult, although not 
impossible in principle, to describe them in a single 
two-level rule system or in a system that is limited to 
just three levels like the KKZ system for French. The 
most natural  description of the Korean alternation is 
a cascade of rules of greater depth. 
2 Morpho log ica l  A l te rnat ions  
in Korean  
3'he \[langul is a phonemic syllabic-based script where 
morphologieal alternations that change the syllable 
strllctnre of the word are rellected in the orthogra- 
phy (Korean Ministry of Education, 1988; Kim, 1990). 
This paper uses the so-called Yale system for repre- 
senting llaugul in a Romanized \[brm, except; that we

sist, of a verb stem, scwu'al endings and pnstpositions. The A,I

3 Const ruc t ion  o f  a Korean

The first, st(q) in the coustruet;ion of a lexieM trans- 
dueer is to create a simple linite--state automaton  for 
all wdid k'.xical tbrms of Korean. The lexical aul, oma- 
ton (I,A) is eomllosed wit;h l,he first set of rule trans- 
ducers (R;I'). The result;ing transducer has on its "Ul/ 
per" side, |,he valid lexical forms, and on the "lower" 
si(le, interm0.(tiate represenl;aJ, ions derived fly the lirst 
set C' rules. This inl;ermediate t ransducer  is composed 
with |,he second set of rule trmlsducers and tim in'o 
tess is itera|,ed several l;imes. At each stage ill tit(! 
process, the lexicaI si(le remains unchanged and the 
iut, erme(liate re\[)resenl,atious are changed by the new 
set C' rules. The \[ilml result is a transducer t im|  asso 
clare's the valid lexic~d forms with their proper surface 
realizations. Concel)tual ly this is similar to what  hap.

it is for general;lolL 
The compila|,ioll aml int;ei:seel,ion of rule d;lNtlls(ltle- 
ers was done with the I.wole eompihw, the cousl;ruetio, 
126.3 
of the LA and the compositions we carried out with 
the Xerox interactive finite-state calculus ('ifsm'). 
3.1 Construction of Lexical Automa- 
ton(Lh) 
The ifsm-utility enabled us to assemble the LA incre- 
mentally. The first step was to divide the total list 
of morphemes into snblexicons on the basis of their 
morphological type and to make a text file for each 
sublexieon. We added diacritic markers to the edges 
of certain types of morphemes in order to be able to 
enforce morphotactie constraints on valid morpheme 
sequences .  
Each sublexicon was compiled separately to a finite- 
state automaton. The sublexicons were used to con 
struct the LA with the help of the regular expression 
facility in the ifsm-toolkit..For example, having com- 
piled a simple automaton from the list ofsm@le nouns, 
we could expand it to an infinite lexicon of compound 
nouns with the regular expression 
"noun.auto" \ [# "noun.auto"l* 
'\]'his regular expression reads the noun automaton 
from a file and concatenates it with itself any number 
of times and marks the internal word boundaries with 
#.  
The first version of the LA was made in this way by 
combining sublexicons with regular operations (con- 
catenation, union, iteration). 
In order to enforce morphotactic constraints on the 
concatenation of some classes of snflixes, we wrote a 
set of two-level rules that require or prohibit he occur- 
fence of particular diacritics at certain suffix bound- 
aries. Lexieal forms that do not satisfy the morpho- 
tactic constraints get eliminated in the composition 
with the well-formedness rules. The diacritics them- 
selves are realized as zero so that they are not present 
in the lower side of the resulting transducer. The final 
form of the lexical automaton is obtained by extract- 
ing the lower-side from that transducer as a simple 
automaton. 
We believe that  this incremental method of lexi- 
con construction is better suited to morphologically 
complex languages than the lexicon format commonly 
used in two-level morphology. In standard two-level 
lexicons, individual entries contain intbrmation about 
which sublexicon they may concatenate with. The en- 
tire lexical structure is compiled in one step to large 
letter tree (Karttunen, 1993; Antworth, 1990). Our 
method is more tractable in two ways. Firstly, the 
lexicon can be developed and refined stepwise. Sec- 
ondly, the morphotactic rules of the language are de- 
scribed explicitly as the regular expressions that con- 
struct the LA in conjunction with the well-formedness 
constraints that eliminate certain types of concatena- 
tions. In two-level lexicons of the standard variety, 
the morphotactic structure of the language is not de- 
scribed explicitly at; all. l~,ather, it is expressed in a 
very opaque and indirect way, in the sequences of links 
between entries and snblexicons. 
Sproat argued thai; two-level morphology of mor- 
photactics leads to a somewhat inelegant model of 
long-distance dependencies and suggested the unfica- 
lion scheme, due to Bear, as a solution (Sproat, 1992). 
But unification scheme introduces additional runtime 
overhead. The above approach can easily and explic- 
itly describe the fact that "-able" attaches to verbs 
formed with the prefix "en-" and does not require ad- 
ditional runtime overhead. 
We give a few examples of the difficulties in the de- 
scription of Korean morphol;artics. There are two dif- 
ferent types of endings: (i) non-tinM (verbal) endings 
for tense, modality, subject honorific or aspect, and 
(it) final (verbal) endings as cornplementizer, nomi- 
nalizer and adjectivizer. The non-tinal endings are 
placed in fl'ont of final endings and must be followed 
by a suflix of the second type. 
(4) shows the ordering restrictions of non-finM end- 
ings. The parentheses indicate optionality. 
(4.) (+ lion) (4- t'~st 4- Perf (4- Will) 
I (+ Past ) (+ Will) (4- Beta'o)) 
(Hon:Honorific; \]~etro:I{ei~rospection ; 
Perf: Perfect Aspect) 
(4) compiles to a lexicon covering 20 difi>rent com- 
pound non-final ending sequenees including null. 'l'his 
representation is clearly more informative than a sim- 
ple listing of the members of the class. The proM- 
bition of "Past+Perf+Will+l{.etro" in (4) can not be 
described by an adjacency table. 
In (4) we do not need any morphotactic diacritics 
on the left, because all non-final endings can combine 
with any verb and adjective stems arm the combina- 
tion of non-final and final endings is controlled by the 
diacritics of the latter group. 
(5) shows three entries in the suhlexiron of final 
endings. Tim elements in square brackets are morpho 
tactic diacritics. (Square brackets indicate grouping, 
the vertical bar marks a disjunction.) 'Phe diacritics 
are deleted by well-formedness rules when the final 
endings are combined with other morphemes. The di- 
acritics on the left of nun and nuu-ka shows that they 
can not combine with adjectives.

The success of our work on Korean further underscores 
the point made by KKZ(Karttnncn, 1992a) thai; the 
most salient property of two-level morphology is not 
the number of levels but the fact two-level rules de- 
scribe regular elations (just like classical phonological 
rewrite rnles) (Kaplan, 1988; Ritehie, 1992). Conse- 
quently, it is possible to combine sets of parallel two- 
level rules by intersection and merge them with the 
lexicon and other rule systems in a cascade, of compo- 
sitions. The complexities of Korean morphology make 
it desirable both tbr linguistic and computational rea- 
sons to allow for many more intermediate l vels than 
assumed in previous works on English and t,~reneh, l{.e- 
gardless of the nnmber of intervening levels, the out- 
come is a single lexieal transduce.r thaw directly maps 
lexical forms to their intlected surface realizations, and 
vice versa. 
In the construction of the lexieal automaton for Ko-. 
rean, we have put two-level rules to a novel use as well- 
formedness constraints on lexical tbrms. The sublex- 
icons from which the LA is constructed contain (tia- 
critic marks on the outer edge that identify the type of 
morphoh)gical constituents that the lexicon contains. 
The role of rules in the \[,A constructions i to enforce 
morphotaetics and, at the same time, to eliminate the 
diacritics that encode them. 
Theoretically, we can get the same LT to compose 
the morphotactic and phonological >ties all together 
into one. rule and compose it with the initial LA or 
to compose the initial LA with each rule of the mor 
photaetic and phonological rules one by one in order. 
Practically, the composition of all the morphotactic 
and phonologieal rules into one rule causes the combi- 
natorial explosion of states. This shows that ordered 
rules can be used to avoid the combinatorial explosion 
of states in one two level rule system too.
