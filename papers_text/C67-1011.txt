I .  Long-term querying of the current  s ta te  of 
despondenc ~ with regard to the prospects of 
Mechanics1 Trans lat ion.  
The immediate effect of the recently issued 
Report on Computers inTranslation and 
L~is t i cs .  LANGUAGE ~ MACHINES ~J3 has 
been to spread the view that there is no 
future at all for research in Mechanical 
Translation as such; a view which contrasts 
sharply with the earlier, euphoric view that 
(now that disc-files provide computers with 
indefinitely large memory-systems which can be 
quickly searched by random-access procedures) 
the Mechanical Translation research problem 
was all but "solved". 
It is possible, however, that this second, ultra- 
despondent view is as exaggerated as the first 
one was; all the more so as t h e ~  is written 
from a very narrow research background without 
iny indication of this narrowness being ~iven. 
F~r example, an M.T. Thesaurus has never yet 
been put on a machine; (_~ and the analogy between 
M.T. and Information-Retrieval has never yet been 
explored, (yet retrieving a translation in res- 
ponse to a user's request is basically the same 
as retrieving any other piece of information in 
response to a user's request~ ~ No mention, 
moreover, is made in the Re~ort of the work of 
.2. 
(e.g.) Dolby and Resnikoff in analysing the nature ~ structure of natural-language dictionaries, nor is any recommendation made that more of 
this evidently necessary work should be done.MoTeO~?/~ 
~he need for basic research into the trueproblem 
posed by the ambiguity and extensibility of in- 
dividual language-signals of any order of length, 
and the connection of this with other learning- 
problems and character-recognition-problems~ has 
never yet been faced. In fact, the situation is 
worse; a particular application has been pronounced 
useless and/or impossible before the general field 
of examining the basic semantic nature of human 
communicationhas been created. 
II. R0commendation: do not look at the theoretic com- 
plexities of current researches into language- 
problems: look rather at the techuolo~ical advances 
which have alread 2 been made. 
Thus the basic recommendation given in the Report, 
nalely that practical research into Mechanical 
Translation should be discontinued, while present, 
very narrowand fragmentary trends of "pure" 
theoretic linguistics research should be supported, 
can be queried both ways round. For the advances 
in this field are precisely comlmg from the tech- 
nologies, as the Report itself shows, and that in 
several areas i) Thus computer-tTpe-setting, in 
which hyphenation can be done with a "logic", that 
is, without a dictionary, is now an accomplished 
fact ~ ii) within information retrieval, mech- 
anized retrieval systems of increasing sophisti- 
cation and efficiency, are being constructed for 
practical use at Universities and within industry: 
iii) synthetic speech considered as synthetic 
message, - passed over in the Report because 
created by telephone engineers and not by linguists, 
- is making great strides ahead; iv) high-level 
programming languages increasingly operate more 
llke natural languages, so that the machine can 
pick up and process something more like the user's 
normal way of thinking; v) the Mannheim and 
Luxembourg machine-aided translation-systems are 
acknowledged in the ~ to save 40 - 60 per 
emat of a translator s time; 6(~3 and vi) research 
in automatic character-recogniti0n has now reached 
such a point that consideration of the extent to 
which this will slash M.T. costs and increase M.T. 
usefulness should have not been ignored. C~

I I I .  The Basic Principle of the Man-Machine interact!on. 
The input  to  the  machine i s  a s t ressed  and contoured  
phrasing, i.e. a phrasing with some stresses marked and 
minimal syntactic naming of the constituent words. 
Research to produce this input mechanically, by a 
phrasing-stresser-and-parse~ is currently being supported 
by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, 
London; at present the program (Mark II) segments the 
text into phrasings mechanically, but does not either 
mark the stressed words or provide any snytactic naming. 
(see Appendix A). In the mini-demonstation of the ~an- 
maahine interaction, therefore, (the only one which is 
already operational as a machine,) the operator at present 
types in a single phrasing at a time minus the stressed 
words, which have been pre-marked on his text. Thus, he 
does not type in a complete phrasing, but what we have 
called a phrasing-frame. (Later the machine will compute 
the phrasing-frame from the text~ Examples of assorted 
phrasing-frames are given below:

N.B. Other markers e.g. ~he marker J to set in 
operation a routine to inter-connect syntactiaally 
connected phrasings will be discussed in a further 
publication 
On receiving the phrasing-frame, the machine questions 
the opea~or in order to make him specify further, from 
his general knowledge of the text and of its subject, 
what the cOntext of the particular phraslng-frame is. 
The example given below, in which is progressively 
specified the correct French translation of an English 
~erb of motion (one of the notoriously difficult ~ l i sh  
forms to  t rans la te  in to  French)  shows how compl i ca ted  
th i s  quest ion ing  can be.  Not more than  three  rounds o f

below, however, the d i f fe r~ French translations of all 
possible answers obtainable under Round II and Round III 
of the inter-action are set out immediately underneath 
the English statements which the machine would actually 
print out on the console, in order to show the under- 
lying reason for the whole enterprise.

The o~erator then types in the two stressed words:

and immediately, for the text:

Detailed examination of this example shows that 
~ hind this particular way of making an on-line system teract with an operator there lies a strategy, a 
hyDothes~s and a ~ros~ect ,  
V. The s t ra tegy  i s  a t  a l l  cos ts  to  avo id  post -ed i t ing ;  
but  to  a l low maximal p re -process ing  o f  the  input  text  
by the  machine in teract ing  w i th  the  operat .or ,  a l l  the  
quest ion -and-answer  rout ines  be ing  in  the  operator ' s  
nat ive  language.  
Th@ argument aga ins t  post -ed i t ing  (as  the  U.S.  Repor t  
conc lus ive ly  shows) i s  that  i t  i s  e i ther  mechan ica l  
e .g .  the  reso lu t ion  o f  F rench gender -concord  - in  which 
case  the  machine i t se l f  can be programmed to  do i t  - 
or  i t  i s  c reat ive  and/or  in tu i t i ve ; in  which cgse  i t  can-  
not  be done a t  a l l  w i thout  extens ive  re ference  back to  
the  input  text~ho cou ld  in terpret  "Shakespeare  Overspat" ,  
which was the title of a Russian "Pravda" article as 
translated by the U.S. Air Force ccmputer~ The real 
meaning was "Shakespeare is now a back number"), in 
which case the post-editor might as well have translated 
the whole text h~se l f  in the first place. 
To avoid post-editing, however, the output produced 
by a man-machine reactive M.T. program has either got 
to be a blamk space (when the program fails), or a 
unique translation which is known to be correct. Now 
uniqueness of output can be brutally produced, as every- 
body knows~programming the machine only to print out 
one eg any set of alternatives. Correctness, however, 
can only be achieved by the target-language translation 
having been approved beforehand by the operator, from ~: 
cues which the machine gives him, or which he gives the 
machine - i~ his own language; i.e. in the source 
language. The real use, therefore, of the three-stage 
question-and-answer routine exemplified above, is that 
it enables an Englishman with a console but who does 
.8. 
not know any French to produce a unique and correct 
idiomatic French translation of an English textrprovided 
that he is prepared to take the trouble to pre-process 
the English text so that it is finally restated in a 
Frenchified sort of way. After this the machine can 
of course transcribe it into French. 
In other words, a machine-aided translation program 
basically consists - 
a) of programming the machine to pick up t~e ambiguities 
in the source language which the target-language 
will not tolerste (not the other way round) and 
of making the operator produce the additional 
information which will resolve them. 
Take, as example, the phrasing 
/ fo r  a s tandb2for~.  
This looks technical and unambiguous in the English, 
but comparative examination of bi-lingual text showed 
that it translated into French (and in the same document) 
as either 
i)/d'une force d'urgence~ i.e./"of an emer~ency force/ 
or il) /pour une force de r6serve/ i.e. /"for a reserve 
fo rce" / ,  
accord ing to  soph is t i ca ted  cons iderat ions  of  context .  
Therefore ,  when the operator  types  the techn ica l  term 
STANDBY FORCE in to  the machine, in order  to  f i l l  up the 
gaps in the phrasing-frame /FOR A .......... \ [NS~\ ]  \[AdjJ 
the machine has got to answer him back: 
DO YOU MEAN 
A AN EMERGENCY FORCE 
B A RESERVE FORCE 
The operator then has to choose, and type back into 
the machine the alternative he wants, after which the 
machine can make the translation. 
b) 8imil&z~,,.~ way mustmbefound~ef  emab~ng the 
machine to p ick  up, from cues in the source language,  the 
metaphors and idioms which the ta rget - language w i l l  not  
to le ra te /and  to ass i s t  the operator  to  rephrase  the 
s t re tch  of  text  concerne~d~in terms which the ta rget -  
language w i l l  to le ra te~he d i f fe rence  between idioms 
and metaphors i s  that  id iems can be mechanica l ly  p icked 
up and matched by an idiom d ic t ionary ,  whereas metaphors 
can ' t .  
c) Similarly again, the machine must be programmed to 
pick up, from the source language input, the con- 
structions which the target-language will not tolerate, 
and assist the operator to transform these into con- 
structions which the target-language will tolerate 
(e.g. to turm English passives into FreL~ch actives, 
and the adjectives of English adjective-noun strings 
into French post-positioned prepositional phrases). 
Thus the whole translating work, really, is done 
within the source language. Once you can preprocess 
your English input into a Frenchified shape in the 
respects a), b), c), above, the machine can transform 
this Frenchified English, with no trouble at all, into 
elegant French. 
The strategic hope, of course, is that by analysing 
the printouts produced by a large number of sequences 
of such machine-man interactions, in translating many 
types of texts, we shall ultimately learn how to make the 
machine answer, as well as ask, some of the rounds of 
questions, (as is already being done in a whole range 
of machine "edit" programs), so that the machine shall 
progressively become able to do more of the Frenchifi- 
cation process for itself; thus finally producing, (if 
the machine ever became able completely to take over) 
exceedingly slow but reliable machine translation, - 
which could~subsequsntly again)be speeded up. 
Before further discussion of the extent to which this 
strategic hope is a real hope and haw much a mere pious 
aspiration, i.e. the prospect, I will now set out the 
kvpothesis (as opposed to the strategy) of the experi- 
ment. 
VI. The hypothesis which the translation-model gives is 
the following: 
ATranslation consists of the pairing of a phrasing, 
P7 ' in Language A, with another ~hrasing, P2 ~ in 
Language B, in such a way that PI ~ ~1~forms 
an analogy with PI A, in a sense of "analogy" which 
cam be ostensively defined intterms of the model. 
Thus translating a phrasing into another language is 
no different, (according to this translation-model) 
from defining it, producing a parallel-phrasing to it, 
reiterating or otherwise further specifying it, in the 
same language. ~ 
The advantage of the model is that unambiguous 
criteria of the formation of such a pairing can be given. 
Por any response given by the operator to a machine-ques~ 
tion will form such a ,pair: the first member of the pair 
will be the original phrasing, (in English), the second 
the chosen machine-specification (called by us a template) 
.10. 
also in English. Then another pair will be formed 
whenever the machine translates the operator's final 
choice of template into French; the first member of the 
pair in this case, will be the final template chosen, 
and the seoond member will be the translation into French, 
with the stressed words translated and inserted into 
their correct places. Then again, an intermediate pair 
may be formed of which each member is a template; the 
first member of such a pair will be a more abstract 
template chosen a t the  first round of man-machine inter- 
action, while the second member of it will be the more 
concrete template chosen by the operator at the Second 
round of man-machine interaction; and so on recursively. 
Any such pairing formed by the translation model, 
whether between English phrasing and template, or between 
template and template, or between template and French 
phrasing, we shall call a semantic square. A philosophic 
discussion of the notion of semantic square is given in 
another publication ~.  
A semantic sauare (in terms of thls model) consists 
of the pairing of any two linguistic sequences P1 an.d P2, 
PI and P2 each having the following characteristics. 
i) each has two stressed segments (which when PI is 
paired to P2, form points of the square). 
ii) each has these embedded in some phrasing-frame, 
(which, when PI is paired to P2 forms the fram._.._! of the 
square). 
iii) each has been selected as synonymous @ith the 
other at least once,either by the operator or by the 
machine. 
Thus, according to the model, translation consists 
of sequential semantic-square forming, the sequence of 
semantic squares thus formed continuing until it is 
brought to an end by the machine printim~ out a square 
which has a target-language phrasing as its second ~amber. 
To make all this clearer, let us further develop 
the example of man-machine interaction given above>by 
assumin~ that the phrasing to be translated is 
/HE WENTto  the o l~q~/,  
To translate this, the operator types in 
/HE...E AST~aDVER3~tO the.....8~/~ ~ 
and chooses, at the first round of questioning, the 
abstract template 
H~' COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIF~TE BEING 
.11. 
The first semantic aquare of this sequence formed by 
the model is thus: 
/HE wm+_._~o TH~Po~_~ 
/HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING/. 
The machine then asks: DO YOU MEAN 
A HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY 
B HE TOLD-A~STORY TO SOME LISTENER 
C HE CONSULTED WITH SOME AUTHORITY 
The operator chooses A, thus forming the second 
semantic square in the sequence: 
/HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE-BEING/ 
/HE HEVEAZm>-AI~ TO raRE E~Emr/ 
The operator then types in the stressed word /POLICE/ 
(to specify the nature of the enemy), and the machine 
then forms the final semamtic-square: 
/HE ~VE~mD-ALL  TO THE 
d 
/IL TOUT RE~ELA AUX FLICS/ 
"FLICS" having been pro-chosen by the operator's choices 
of template from a bi-lingual tree-dictionary-entry for 
the English word "police" with nodes as follows: 
Ng:Xl 
lie coa~IAssariat' I 
Thus the sequence of semantic',~squares formed by 
this operation of. the model is 
HE WENT TO THE POLICE 
HE C-~---MMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE-BEING 
2 HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY 
.12. 
HE REVEAlED-ALL TO THE ENEMY 
3 IL TOUT REVELA AUX FLICS----- 
This square-sequence, with its AB BC CD overlap of 
content, I will call the semantic deep-structure of 
the mode~s translation-operation, and the tree-structure 
given above I will call the semantic deep-structure of 
the dictionary-entry. 
The totality of semantic deep-structures given by 
the model is the modei ls ~otal semantic-field. 
V_~ This, stated in the briefest possible terms, is 
the hypothesis given by the model. Now as to the pros- 
pect of developing this line of research. 
The first thing to say is that the model makes clear 
the unsuitability of the ordinary digital computer as 
compared to a human being for performing translation. 
For in this translation-model the computer handles each 
phrasing of the input text as a separate unit, and forces 
the operator, by successive rounds of questioning, so to 
specify it that it can be translated unambi~aously into 
French. But the human being, who does not treat each 
phrasing of a text as a separate unit, but who uses his 
understanding of the sarlier phrasings of a text to 
~aide him in hls understanding of the later ones, does 
not have to ask himself nearly so many questions. A 
progressive learning-model of translation, then, is what 
is really required, rather than the present single- 
phrasing-matching model. On the other hand, the com- 
plezity which has to be introduced into the model to 
account for all the differing French translations which 
have to be made of a single piece of English, according 
to its context, this would have to be introduced into 
any effective M.T. program: since you cannot retrieve 
from any computerised data-system any data which you 
have not first put in. But this second t~pe of com- 
plexity can be put into the machine gradually, by 
feeding in data obtained from examining the inter- 
lingual correspondenc~in a large corpus of bi-lingual 
text. 
There is, however, another, muc~ deeper obstacle 
to developing this research, and that is that (as M.T. 
research-workers have for some time past muspected) 
bi-lingual dictionaries provide almost no clue to 
semantic deep-structure. 
Within the context of the present experiment this 
became apparent in examining the English word "deliber- 
ations". The examination began with the construction 
of a dictionary-entry-card of the following form: 
English: DELIBERATIONS 
French: ~ OELIB~Pd~TIONS 
This entry being queried (and the maker of it having 
defended himself by saying that "deliberations" was 
the only word he knew of in English which could really 
be translated by the corresponding word in French), it 
was checked with Vinay's Dictionary~1~which ~ave the 
entry /d~bats mp1, discussion/. However, w~en an 
investigation whs made of how it was act~l ly  ~ranslated 
in the corpus of text, it only occurred once, where it 
was translated "membres", as follows: 
English 
The illustrative and comparative 
materials presented 
may~he lp fu l  
to the deliberations of this committee 
French 
Les donn~'es explicatives 
et comuaratives ( )  
se r~v~leront, peut-etre 
tr~s utiles 
pou--'~ les me-------mbres du comit~ 
Moreover, the tramslator, in translating it t~us, was 
quite right; not only because "utiles" in French, likes 
a concrete complement, but also because this is what

However, this t ~ a  semantic deep-structure 
for the hi-lingual dictlonary-entry of ~deliberations" 
of the following form:

It becomes evident, then, that if we are to make a 
~r Chlne account for the translations~ which good human anslators actually produce~using the kind of modern 
which has been reported o ~  this paper, the problem 
is that of finding the ~ structures of the dlc- 
tionary-entries from the data actually given by a bi- 
lingual corpus; for the construction of the square- 
forming templates must depend on these- that is if the 
template-glossary and the bi-llngual dictionary are to 
interlock. 
Present resmarch efforts are ~herefore being con- 
centrated on the problem o f  "f~rming up" the whole notion 
of semantic dictionary-entry deep-structure.

CONCLUSION 
In view of the great interest which has already 
been aroused by this experiment, its small scale and 
pilot nature must be emphasized. (Actual output from 
a trial run of the program is given in Appendix ~). 
It has been implemented only on an I.C.T. 1202 computer, 
with T.R.A.C. facility, to which a single keyboard 
has been attlched, just under the print-out, on which 
the machine's "replies" to the operator, as well as his 
"questions" appear. This machine has only 4K store 
with no back-up, and 2K of this is occupied by the 
T.R.A.C. facility; the rest of the store will therefore 
only hold enough Thesaurus to process an average of lO 
"phrasing-frames" at ~ny one time, so the sections of 
Thesaurus which are needed for any particular test have 
to be prechosen by hand f romthe larger deck of punched 
cards of which the Thesaurus, in its machine-readable 
form, consists. Even these cards, however, are only 
punched as required; the basic triple dictionary, from 
which the Thesaurus is being built up, is being stored on 
ordinary business equipment, (Twinlock Hand i~e~inder  
HRA3 handled with a Shunic Signalling System ~ Paper 
and a SASCO System so as to ensure maximum flexibility 
and ease of entry-cham~e)o 
Mark II of this program is to be implemented on ~n 
I.CoT. 1903 with disc-file and multiple-access T.R.A.Co 
facility, but this is not expected to be operational 
till 1968.

. A project supported by the U.S. National Science 
Foundation at the University of Bloomington, 
Indiana, has just been started, to make a Thesaurus 
for Information Retrieval in 50 languages. 
Also a historical Thesaurus of English is being 
compiled on a long-term basis by Professor Samuel 
at the University of Glasgow; and another, compiled 
by John Bromwich, is being put on magnetic tape at 
the Linguistics Computation Centre, Cambridge 
University. 
The properties and structure of thesauruses and/or 
conceptual dictionaries have never yet, however, 
been mechanically examined; partly because, until 
lately, machines with rapld-access-time to suffic- 
iently large memories were not available, and 
partly because of the overall cost of such a project.

The phrasing method offers two operational 
simplifications 
i) by mapping the distribution of stresses on to 
a binary frame; 
il) by applying a phonetlcally-derived feature 
to Ear ,  instead of to syllables or phonemes.
