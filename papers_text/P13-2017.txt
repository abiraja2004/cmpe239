Abstract
We present a new collection of treebanks
with homogeneous syntactic dependency
annotation for six languages: German,
English, Swedish, Spanish, French and
Korean. To show the usefulness of such a
resource, we present a case study of cross-
lingual transfer parsing with more reliable
evaluation than has been possible before.
This ?universal? treebank is made freely
available in order to facilitate research on
multilingual dependency parsing.1
1 Introduction
In recent years, syntactic representations based
on head-modifier dependency relations between
words have attracted a lot of interest (Ku?bler et
al., 2009). Research in dependency parsing ? com-
putational methods to predict such representations
? has increased dramatically, due in large part to
the availability of dependency treebanks in a num-
ber of languages. In particular, the CoNLL shared
tasks on dependency parsing have provided over
twenty data sets in a standardized format (Buch-
holz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al, 2007).
While these data sets are standardized in terms
of their formal representation, they are still hetero-
geneous treebanks. That is to say, despite them
all being dependency treebanks, which annotate
each sentence with a dependency tree, they sub-
scribe to different annotation schemes. This can
include superficial differences, such as the renam-
ing of common relations, as well as true diver-
gences concerning the analysis of linguistic con-
structions. Common divergences are found in the

analysis of coordination, verb groups, subordinate
clauses, and multi-word expressions (Nilsson et
al., 2007; Ku?bler et al, 2009; Zeman et al, 2012).
These data sets can be sufficient if one?s goal
is to build monolingual parsers and evaluate their
quality without reference to other languages, as
in the original CoNLL shared tasks, but there are
many cases where heterogenous treebanks are less
than adequate. First, a homogeneous represen-
tation is critical for multilingual language tech-
nologies that require consistent cross-lingual anal-
ysis for downstream components. Second, consis-
tent syntactic representations are desirable in the
evaluation of unsupervised (Klein and Manning,
2004) or cross-lingual syntactic parsers (Hwa et
al., 2005). In the cross-lingual study of McDonald
et al (2011), where delexicalized parsing models
from a number of source languages were evalu-
ated on a set of target languages, it was observed
that the best target language was frequently not the
closest typologically to the source. In one stun-
ning example, Danish was the worst source lan-
guage when parsing Swedish, solely due to greatly
divergent annotation schemes.
In order to overcome these difficulties, some
cross-lingual studies have resorted to heuristics to
homogenize treebanks (Hwa et al, 2005; Smith
and Eisner, 2009; Ganchev et al, 2009), but we
are only aware of a few systematic attempts to
create homogenous syntactic dependency anno-
tation in multiple languages. In terms of auto-
matic construction, Zeman et al (2012) attempt
to harmonize a large number of dependency tree-
banks by mapping their annotation to a version of
the Prague Dependency Treebank scheme (Hajic?
et al, 2001; Bo?hmova? et al, 2003). Addition-
ally, there have been efforts to manually or semi-
manually construct resources with common syn-
92
tactic analyses across multiple languages using al-
ternate syntactic theories as the basis for the repre-
sentation (Butt et al, 2002; Helmreich et al, 2004;
Hovy et al, 2006; Erjavec, 2012).
In order to facilitate research on multilingual
syntactic analysis, we present a collection of data
sets with uniformly analyzed sentences for six lan-
guages: German, English, French, Korean, Span-
ish and Swedish. This resource is freely avail-
able and we plan to extend it to include more data
and languages. In the context of part-of-speech
tagging, universal representations, such as that of
Petrov et al (2012), have already spurred numer-
ous examples of improved empirical cross-lingual
systems (Zhang et al, 2012; Gelling et al, 2012;
Ta?ckstro?m et al, 2013). We aim to do the same for
syntactic dependencies and present cross-lingual
parsing experiments to highlight some of the bene-
fits of cross-lingually consistent annotation. First,
results largely conform to our expectations of
which target languages should be useful for which
source languages, unlike in the study of McDon-
ald et al (2011). Second, the evaluation scores
in general are significantly higher than previous
cross-lingual studies, suggesting that most of these
studies underestimate true accuracy. Finally, un-
like all previous cross-lingual studies, we can re-
port full labeled accuracies and not just unlabeled
structural accuracies.
2 Towards A Universal Treebank
The Stanford typed dependencies for English
(De Marneffe et al, 2006; de Marneffe and Man-
ning, 2008) serve as the point of departure for our
?universal? dependency representation, together
with the tag set of Petrov et al (2012) as the under-
lying part-of-speech representation. The Stanford
scheme, partly inspired by the LFG framework,
has emerged as a de facto standard for depen-
dency annotation in English and has recently been
adapted to several languages representing different
(and typologically diverse) language groups, such
as Chinese (Sino-Tibetan) (Chang et al, 2009),
Finnish (Finno-Ugric) (Haverinen et al, 2010),
Persian (Indo-Iranian) (Seraji et al, 2012), and
Modern Hebrew (Semitic) (Tsarfaty, 2013). Its
widespread use and proven adaptability makes it a
natural choice for our endeavor, even though ad-
ditional modifications will be needed to capture
the full variety of grammatical structures in the
world?s languages.

Figure 1: A sample French sentence.
We use the so-called basic dependencies (with
punctuation included), where every dependency
structure is a tree spanning all the input tokens,
because this is the kind of representation that most
available dependency parsers require. A sample
dependency tree from the French data set is shown
in Figure 1. We take two approaches to generat-
ing data. The first is traditional manual annotation,
as previously used by Helmreich et al (2004) for
multilingual syntactic treebank construction. The
second, used only for English and Swedish, is to
automatically convert existing treebanks, as in Ze-
man et al (2012).
2.1 Automatic Conversion
Since the Stanford dependencies for English are
taken as the starting point for our universal annota-
tion scheme, we begin by describing the data sets
produced by automatic conversion. For English,
we used the Stanford parser (v1.6.8) (Klein and
Manning, 2003) to convert the Wall Street Jour-
nal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al,
1993) to basic dependency trees, including punc-
tuation and with the copula verb as head in cop-
ula constructions. For Swedish, we developed a
set of deterministic rules for converting the Tal-
banken part of the Swedish Treebank (Nivre and
Megyesi, 2007) to a representation as close as pos-
sible to the Stanford dependencies for English.
This mainly consisted in relabeling dependency
relations and, due to the fine-grained label set used
in the Swedish Treebank (Teleman, 1974), this
could be done with high precision. In addition,
a small number of constructions required struc-
tural conversion, notably coordination, which in
the Swedish Treebank is given a Prague style anal-
ysis (Nilsson et al, 2007). For both English and
Swedish, we mapped the language-specific part-
of-speech tags to universal tags using the map-
pings of Petrov et al (2012).
2.2 Manual Annotation
For the remaining four languages, annotators were
given three resources: 1) the English Stanford
93
guidelines; 2) a set of English sentences with Stan-
ford dependencies and universal tags (as above);
and 3) a large collection of unlabeled sentences
randomly drawn from newswire, weblogs and/or
consumer reviews, automatically tokenized with a
rule-based system. For German, French and Span-
ish, contractions were split, except in the case of
clitics. For Korean, tokenization was more coarse
and included particles within token units. Annota-
tors could correct this automatic tokenization.
The annotators were then tasked with producing
language-specific annotation guidelines with the
expressed goal of keeping the label and construc-
tion set as close as possible to the original English
set, only adding labels for phenomena that do not
exist in English. Making fine-grained label dis-
tinctions was discouraged. Once these guidelines
were fixed, annotators selected roughly an equal
amount of sentences to be annotated from each do-
main in the unlabeled data. As the sentences were
already randomly selected from a larger corpus,
annotators were told to view the sentences in or-
der and to discard a sentence only if it was 1) frag-
mented because of a sentence splitting error; 2) not
from the language of interest; 3) incomprehensible
to a native speaker; or 4) shorter than three words.
The selected sentences were pre-processed using
cross-lingual taggers (Das and Petrov, 2011) and
parsers (McDonald et al, 2011).
The annotators modified the pre-parsed trees us-
ing the TrEd2 tool. At the beginning of the annota-
tion process, double-blind annotation, followed by
manual arbitration and consensus, was used itera-
tively for small batches of data until the guidelines
were finalized. Most of the data was annotated
using single-annotation and full review: one an-
notator annotating the data and another reviewing
it, making changes in close collaboration with the
original annotator. As a final step, all annotated
data was semi-automatically checked for annota-
tion consistency.
2.3 Harmonization
After producing the two converted and four an-
notated data sets, we performed a harmonization
step, where the goal was to maximize consistency
of annotation across languages. In particular, we
wanted to eliminate cases where the same label
was used for different linguistic relations in dif-
ferent languages and, conversely, where one and

the same relation was annotated with different la-
bels, both of which could happen accidentally be-
cause annotators were allowed to add new labels
for the language they were working on. Moreover,
we wanted to avoid, as far as possible, labels that
were only used in one or two languages.
In order to satisfy these requirements, a number
of language-specific labels were merged into more
general labels. For example, in analogy with the
nn label for (element of a) noun-noun compound,
the annotators of German added aa for compound
adjectives, and the annotators of Korean added vv
for compound verbs. In the harmonization step,
these three labels were merged into a single label
compmod for modifier in compound.
In addition to harmonizing language-specific la-
bels, we also renamed a small number of relations,
where the name would be misleading in the uni-
versal context (although quite appropriate for En-
glish). For example, the label prep (for a mod-
ifier headed by a preposition) was renamed adp-
mod, to make clear the relation to other modifier
labels and to allow postpositions as well as prepo-
sitions.3 We also eliminated a few distinctions in
the original Stanford scheme that were not anno-
tated consistently across languages (e.g., merging
complm with mark, number with num, and purpcl
with advcl).
The final set of labels is listed with explanations
in Table 1. Note that relative to the universal part-
of-speech tagset of Petrov et al (2012) our final
label set is quite rich (40 versus 12). This is due
mainly to the fact that the the former is based on
deterministic mappings from a large set of annota-
tion schemes and therefore reduced to the granu-
larity of the greatest common denominator. Such a
reduction may ultimately be necessary also in the
case of dependency relations, but since most of our
data sets were created through manual annotation,
we could afford to retain a fine-grained analysis,
knowing that it is always possible to map from
finer to coarser distinctions, but not vice versa.4
2.4 Final Data Sets
Table 2 presents the final data statistics. The num-
ber of sentences, tokens and tokens/sentence vary
3Consequently, pobj and pcomp were changed to adpobj
and adpcomp.
4The only two data sets that were created through con-
version in our case were English, for which the Stanford de-
pendencies were originally defined, and Swedish, where the
native annotation happens to have a fine-grained label set.

due to the source and tokenization. For example,
Korean has 50% more sentences than Spanish, but
?40k less tokens due to a more coarse-grained to-
kenization. In addition to the data itself, anno-
tation guidelines and harmonization rules are in-
cluded so that the data can be regenerated.
3 Experiments
One of the motivating factors in creating such a
data set was improved cross-lingual transfer eval-
uation. To test this, we use a cross-lingual transfer
parser similar to that of McDonald et al (2011).
In particular, it is a perceptron-trained shift-reduce
parser with a beam of size 8. We use the features
of Zhang and Nivre (2011), except that all lexical
identities are dropped from the templates during
training and testing, hence inducing a ?delexical-
ized? model that employs only ?universal? proper-
ties from source-side treebanks, such as part-of-
speech tags, labels, head-modifier distance, etc.
We ran a number of experiments, which can be
seen in Table 3. For these experiments we ran-
domly split each data set into training, develop-
ment and testing sets.5 The one exception is En-
glish, where we used the standard splits. Each
row in Table 3 represents a source training lan-
guage and each column a target evaluation lan-
guage. We report both unlabeled attachment score
(UAS) and labeled attachment score (LAS) (Buch-
holz and Marsi, 2006). This is likely the first re-
liable cross-lingual parsing evaluation. In partic-
ular, previous studies could not even report LAS
due to differences in treebank annotations.
We can make several interesting observations.
Most notably, for the Germanic and Romance tar-
get languages, the best source language is from
the same language group. This is in stark contrast
to the results of McDonald et al (2011), who ob-
serve that this is rarely the case with the heteroge-
nous CoNLL treebanks. Among the Germanic
languages, it is interesting to note that Swedish
is the best source language for both German and
English, which makes sense from a typological
point of view, because Swedish is intermediate be-
tween German and English in terms of word or-
der properties. For Romance languages, the cross-
lingual parser is approaching the accuracy of the
supervised setting, confirming that for these lan-
guages much of the divergence is lexical and not
structural, which is not true for the Germanic lan-
guages. Finally, Korean emerges as a very clear
outlier (both as a source and as a target language),
which again is supported by typological consider-
ations as well as by the difference in tokenization.
With respect to evaluation, it is interesting to
compare the absolute numbers to those reported
in McDonald et al (2011) for the languages com-

mon to both studies (DE, EN, SV and ES). In that
study, UAS was in the 38?68% range, as compared
to 55?75% here. For Swedish, we can even mea-
sure the difference exactly, because the test sets
are the same, and we see an increase from 58.3%
to 70.6%. This suggests that most cross-lingual
parsing studies have underestimated accuracies.
4 Conclusion
We have released data sets for six languages with
consistent dependency annotation. After the ini-
tial release, we will continue to annotate data in
more languages as well as investigate further au-
tomatic treebank conversions. This may also lead
to modifications of the annotation scheme, which
should be regarded as preliminary at this point.
Specifically, with more typologically and morpho-
logically diverse languages being added to the col-
lection, it may be advisable to consistently en-
force the principle that content words take func-
tion words as dependents, which is currently vi-
olated in the analysis of adpositional and copula
constructions. This will ensure a consistent analy-
sis of functional elements that in some languages
are not realized as free words or are not obliga-
tory, such as adpositions which are often absent
due to case inflections in languages like Finnish. It
will also allow the inclusion of language-specific
functional or morphological markers (case mark-
ers, topic markers, classifiers, etc.) at the leaves of
the tree, where they can easily be ignored in appli-
cations that require a uniform cross-lingual repre-
sentation. Finally, this data is available on an open
source repository in the hope that the community
will commit new data and make corrections to ex-
isting annotations.
