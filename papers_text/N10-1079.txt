Abstract
State-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT)
systems are still far from being perfect. An al-
ternative is the so-called Interactive Machine
Translation (IMT) framework. In this frame-
work, the knowledge of a human translator is
combined with a MT system. The vast ma-
jority of the existing work on IMT makes use
of the well-known batch learning paradigm.
In the batch learning paradigm, the training of
the IMT system and the interactive translation
process are carried out in separate stages. This
paradigm is not able to take advantage of the
new knowledge produced by the user of the
IMT system. In this paper, we present an ap-
plication of the online learning paradigm to
the IMT framework. In the online learning
paradigm, the training and prediction stages
are no longer separated. This feature is par-
ticularly useful in IMT since it allows the user
feedback to be taken into account. The online
learning techniques proposed here incremen-
tally update the statistical models involved in
the translation process. Empirical results show
the great potential of online learning in the
IMT framework.
1 Introduction
Information technology advances have led to the
need for more efficient translation methods. Current
MT systems are not able to produce ready-to-use
texts. Indeed, MT systems usually require human
post-editing to achieve high-quality translations.
One way of taking advantage of MT systems is to
combine them with the knowledge of a human trans-
lator in the IMT paradigm, which is a special type of
the computer-assisted translation paradigm (Isabelle
and Church, 1997). An important contribution to
IMT technology was pioneered by the TransType
project (Foster et al, 1997; Langlais et al, 2002)
where data driven MT techniques were adapted for
their use in an interactive translation environment.
Following the TransType ideas, Barrachina et
al. (2009) proposed a new approach to IMT, in which
fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems are used
to produce full target sentence hypotheses, or por-
tions thereof, which can be partially or completely
accepted and amended by a human translator. Each
partial, correct text segment is then used by the
SMT system as additional information to achieve
improved suggestions. Figure 1 illustrates a typical
IMT session.

Figure 1: IMT session to translate a Spanish sen-
tence into English. In interaction-0, the system sug-
gests a translation (es). In interaction-1, the user
moves the mouse to accept the first eight characters
?To view ? and presses the a key (k), then the sys-
tem suggests completing the sentence with ?list of
resources? (a new es). Interactions 2 and 3 are sim-
ilar. In the final interaction, the user accepts the cur-
rent suggestion.
In this paper, we also focus on the IMT frame-
work. Specifically, we present an IMT system that is
able to learn from user feedback. For this purpose,
we apply the online learning paradigm to the IMT
framework. The online learning techniques that we
propose here allow the statistical models involved in
the translation process to be incrementally updated.

Figure 2 (inspired from (Vidal et al, 2007)) shows
a schematic view of these ideas. Here, f is the in-
put sentence and e is the output derived by the IMT
system from f . By observing f and e, the user inter-
acts with the IMT system until the desired output e? is
produced. The input sentence f and its desired trans-
lation e? can be used to refine the models used by the
system. In general, the model is initially obtained
through a classical batch training process from a pre-
viously given training sequence of pairs (fi,ei) from
the task being considered. Now, the models can be
extended with the use of valuable user feedback.

2 Interactive machine translation
IMT can be seen as an evolution of the SMT frame-
work. Given a sentence f from a source lan-
guage F to be translated into a target sentence e
of a target language E , the fundamental equation of
SMT (Brown et al, 1993) is the following:
e? = argmax
e
{Pr(e | f)} (1)
= argmax
e
{Pr(f | e)Pr(e)} (2)
where Pr(f | e) is approximated by a translation
model that represents the correlation between the
source and the target sentence and where Pr(e) is
approximated by a language model representing the
well-formedness of the candidate translation e.
State-of-the-art statistical machine translation
systems follow a loglinear approach (Och and Ney,
2002), where direct modelling of the posterior prob-
ability Pr(e | f) of Equation (1) is used. In this case,
the decision rule is given by the expression:
e? = argmax
e
{
M
?
m=1
?mhm(e, f)
}
(3)
where each hm(e, f) is a feature function represent-
ing a statistical model and ?m its weight.
Current MT systems are based on the use of
phrase-based models (Koehn et al, 2003) as transla-
tion models. The basic idea of Phrase-based Trans-
lation (PBT) is to segment the source sentence into
phrases, then to translate each source phrase into a
target phrase, and finally to reorder the translated
target phrases in order to compose the target sen-
tence. If we summarize all the decisions made dur-
ing the phrase-based translation process by means of
the hidden variable a?K1 , we obtain the expression:
Pr(f |e) =
?
K,a?K1
Pr(f?K1 , a?K1 | e?K1 ) (4)
where each a?k ? {1 . . .K} denotes the index of the
target phrase e? that is aligned with the k-th source
phrase f?k, assuming a segmentation of length K.
According to Equation (4), and following a max-
imum approximation, the problem stated in Equa-
tion (2) can be reframed as:
e? ? arg max
e,a
{
p(e) ? p(f ,a | e)
}
(5)
In the IMT scenario, we have to find an extension
es for a given prefix ep. To do this we reformulate
Equation (5) as follows:
e?s ? arg max
es,a
{
p(es | ep) ? p(f ,a | ep, es)
}
(6)
where the term p(ep) has been dropped since it does
depend neither on es nor on a.
Thus, the search is restricted to those sentences e
which contain ep as prefix. It is also worth mention-
ing that the similarities between Equation (6) and
Equation (5) (note that epes ? e) allow us to use
the same models whenever the search procedures are
adequately modified (Barrachina et al, 2009).
Following the loglinear approach stated in Equa-
tion (3), Equation (6) can be rewriten as:
e?s = argmax
es,a
{
M
?
m=1
?mhm(e,a, f)
}
(7)
547
which is the approach that we follow in this work.
A common problem in IMT arises when the user
sets a prefix (ep) which cannot be found in the
phrase-based statistical translation model. Differ-
ent solutions have been proposed to deal with this
problem. The use of word translation graphs, as a
compact representation of all possible translations
of a source sentence, is proposed in (Barrachina
et al, 2009). In (Ortiz-Mart??nez et al, 2009), a
technique based on the generation of partial phrase-
based alignments is described. This last proposal has
also been adopted in this work.
3 Related work
In this paper we present an application of the online
learning paradigm to the IMT framework. In the on-
line learning setting, models are trained sample by
sample. Our work is also related to model adapta-
tion, although model adaptation and online learning
are not exactly the same thing.
The online learning paradigm has been previ-
ously applied to train discriminative models in
SMT (Liang et al, 2006; Arun and Koehn, 2007;
Watanabe et al, 2007; Chiang et al, 2008). These
works differ from the one presented here in that we
apply online learning techniques to train generative
models instead of discriminative models.
In (Nepveu et al, 2004), dynamic adaptation of
an IMT system via cache-based model extensions to
language and translation models is proposed. The
work by Nepveu et al (2004) constitutes a domain
adaptation technique and not an online learning
technique, since the proposed cache components re-
quire pre-existent models estimated in batch mode.
In addition to this, their IMT system does not use
state-of-the-art models.
To our knowledge, the only previous work on on-
line learning for IMT is (Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2008),
where a very constrained version of online learn-
ing is presented. This constrained version of online
learning is not able to extend the translation models
due to technical problems with the efficiency of the
learning process. In this paper, we present a purely
statistical IMT systemwhich is able to incrementally
update the parameters of all of the different models
that are used in the system, including the transla-
tion model, breaking with the above mentioned con-
straints. What is more, our system is able to learn
from scratch, that is, without any preexisting model
stored in the system. This is demonstrated empiri-
cally in section 5.
4 Online IMT
In this section we propose an online IMT system.
First, we describe the basic IMT system involved
in the interactive translation process. Then we in-
troduce the required techniques to incrementally up-
date the statistical models used by the system.
4.1 Basic IMT system
The basic IMT system that we propose uses a log-
linear model to generate its translations. According
to Equation (7), we introduce a set of seven feature
functions (from h1 to h7):
? n-gram language model (h1)
h1(e) = log(
?|e|+1
i=1 p(ei|ei?1i?n+1)), 1 where
p(ei|ei?1i?n+1) is defined as follows:
p(ei|ei?1i?n+1) =
max{cX(eii?n+1)?Dn, 0}
cX(ei?1i?n+1)
+
Dn
cX(ei?1i?n+1)
N1+(ei?1i?n+1?) ? p(ei|ei?1i?n+2) (8)
where Dn = cn,1cn,1+2cn,2 is a fixed discount (cn,1
and cn,2 are the number of n-grams with one
and two counts respectively),N1+(ei?1i?n+1?) is the
number of unique words that follows the history
ei?1i?n+1 and cX(eii?n+1) is the count of the n-gram
eii?n+1, where cX(?) can represent true counts
cT (?) or modified counts cM (?). True counts are
used for the higher order n-grams and modified
counts for the lower order n-grams. Given a cer-
tain n-gram, its modified count consists in the
number of different words that precede this n-
gram in the training corpus.
Equation (8) corresponds to the probability given
by an n-gram language model with an interpolated
version of the Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and
Goodman, 1996).
1|e| is the length of e, e0 denotes the begin-of-sentence sym-
bol, e|e|+1 denotes the end-of-sentence symbol, e
j
i ? ei...ej
548
? target sentence-length model (h2)
h2(e, f) = log(p(|f | | |e|)) = log(?|e|(|f |+0.5)?
?|e|(|f | ? 0.5)), where ?|e|(?) denotes the cumula-
tive distribution function (cdf) for the normal dis-
tribution (the cdf is used here to integrate the nor-
mal density function over an interval of length 1).
We use a specific normal distribution with mean
?|e| and standard deviation ?|e| for each possible
target sentence length |e|.
? inverse and direct phrase-based models (h3, h4)
h3(e,a, f) = log(
?K
k=1 p(f?k|e?a?k)), where
p(f?k|e?a?k) is defined as follows:
p(f?k|e?a?k) = ? ? pphr(f?k|e?a?k) +
(1? ?).phmm(f?k|e?a?k) (9)
In Equation (9), pphr(f?k|e?a?k) denotes the proba-
bility given by a statistical phrase-based dictionary
used in regular phrase-based models (see (Koehn
et al, 2003) for more details). phmm(f?k|e?a?k) is
the probability given by an HMM-based (intra-
phrase) alignment model (see (Vogel et al, 1996)):
phmm(f? |e?) = ?
?
a|f? |1
|f? |
?
j=1
p(f?j |e?aj ) ? p(aj |aj?1, |e?|)
(10)
The HMM-based alignment model probability is
used here for smoothing purposes as described
in (Ortiz-Mart??nez et al, 2009).
Analogously h4 is defined as:
h4(e,a, f) = log(
?K
k=1 p(e?a?k |f?k))
? target phrase-length model (h5)
h5(e,a, f) = log(
?K
k=1 p(|e?k|)), where p(|e?k|) =
?(1? ?)|e?k|. h5 implements a target phrase-length
model by means of a geometric distribution with
probability of success on each trial ?. The use of a
geometric distribution penalizes the length of tar-
get phrases.
? source phrase-length model (h6)
h6(e,a, f) = log(
?K
k=1 p(|f?k| | |e?a?k |)),
where p(|f?k| | |e?a?k |) = ?(1? ?)abs(|f?k|?|e?a?k |) and
abs(?) is the absolute value function. A geometric
distribution is used to model this feature (it penal-
izes the difference between the source and target
phrase lengths).
? distortion model (h7)
h7(a) = log(
?K
k=1 p(a?k|a?k?1)), where
p(a?k|a?k?1) = ?(1 ? ?)abs(ba?k?la?k?1 ), ba?k
denotes the beginning position of the source
phrase covered by a?k and la?k?1 denotes the last
position of the source phrase covered by a?k?1.
A geometric distribution is used to model this
feature (it penalizes the reorderings).
The log-linear model, which includes the above
described feature functions, is used to generate the
suffix es given the user-validated prefix ep. Specif-
ically, the IMT system generates a partial phrase-
based alignment between the user prefix ep and a
portion of the source sentence f , and returns the suf-
fix es as the translation of the remaining portion of
f (see (Ortiz-Mart??nez et al, 2009)).
4.2 Extending the IMT system from user
feedback
After translating a source sentence f , a new sen-
tence pair (f , e) is available to feed the IMT system
(see Figure 1). In this section we describe how the
log-linear model described in section 4.1 is updated
given the new sentence pair. To do this, a set of suf-
ficient statistics that can be incrementally updated is
maintained for each feature function hi(?). A suffi-
cient statistic for a statistical model is a statistic that
captures all the information that is relevant to esti-
mate this model.
Regarding feature function h1 and according to
equation (8), we need to maintain the following data:
ck,1 and ck,2 given any order k, N1+(?), and cX(?)
(see section 4.1 for the meaning of each symbol).
Given a new sentence e, and for each k-gram eii?k+1
of e where 1 ? k ? n and 1 ? i ? |e|+1, we mod-
ify the set of sufficient statistics as it is shown in Al-
gorithm 1. The algorithm checks the changes in the
counts of the k-grams to update the set of sufficient
statistics. Sufficient statistics forDk are updated fol-
lowing the auxiliar procedure shown in Algorithm 2.
Feature function h2 requires the incremental cal-
culation of the mean ?|e| and the standard deviation
?|e| of the normal distribution associated to a target
sentence length |e|. For this purpose the procedure
described in (Knuth, 1981) can be used. In this pro-
cedure, two quantities are maintained for each nor-
mal distribution: ?|e| and S|e|. Given a new sentence
549
input : n (higher order), eii?k+1 (k-gram),
S = {?j(cj,1, cj,2), N1+(?), cX(?)}
(current set of sufficient statistics)
output : S (updated set of sufficient statistics)
begin
if cT (eii?k+1) = 0 then
if k ? 1 ? 1 then
updD(S,k-1,cM (ei?1i?k+2),cM (ei?1i?k+2)+1)
if cM (ei?1i?k+2) = 0 then
N1+(ei?1i?k+2) = N1+(ei?1i?k+2) + 1
cM (ei?1i?k+2) = cM (ei?1i?k+2) + 1
cM (eii?k+2) = cM (eii?k+2) + 1
if k = n then
N1+(ei?1i?k+1) = N1+(ei?1i?k+1) + 1
if k = n then
updD(S,k,cT (eii?k+1),cT (eii?k+1) + 1)
cT (ei?1i?k+1)=cT (ei?1i?k+1) + 1
cT (eii?k+1)=cT (eii?k+1) + 1
end
Algorithm 1: Pseudocode for updating the suf-
ficient statistics of a given k-gram

(order), c (current count), c? (new count)
output : (ck,1, ck,2) (updated sufficient statistics)
begin
if c = 0 then
if c? = 1 then ck,1 = ck,1 + 1
if c? = 2 then ck,2 = ck,2 + 1
if c = 1 then
ck,1 = ck,1 ? 1
if c? = 2 then ck,2 = ck,2 + 1
if c = 2 then ck,2 = ck,2 ? 1
end
Algorithm 2: Pseudocode for the updD proce-
dure
pair (f , e), the two quantities are updated using a re-
currence relation:
?|e| = ?
?
|e| + (|f | ? ?
?
|e|)/c(|e|) (11)
S|e| = S
?
|e| + (|f | ? ?
?
|e|)(|f | ? ?|e|) (12)
where c(|e|) is the count of the number of sentences
of length |e| that have been seen so far, and ??|e| and
S?|e| are the quantities previously stored (?|e| is ini-
tialized to the source sentence length of the first sam-
ple and S|e| is initialized to zero). Finally, the stan-
dard deviation can be obtained from S as follows:
?|e| =
?
S|e|/(c(|e|)? 1).
Feature functions h3 and h4 implement inverse
and direct smoothed phrase-based models respec-
tively. Since phrase-based models are symmetric
models, only an inverse phrase-based model is main-
tained (direct probabilities can be efficiently ob-
tained using appropriate data structures, see (Ortiz-
Mart??nez et al, 2008)). The inverse phrase model
probabilities are estimated from the phrase counts:
p(f? |e?) = c(f? , e?)
?
f? ? c(f? ?, e?)
(13)
According to Equation (13), the set of suffi-
cient statistics to be stored for the inverse phrase
model consists of a set of phrase counts (c(f? , e?) and
?
f? ? c(f? ?, e?) must be stored separately). Given a
new sentence pair (f , e), the standard phrase-based
model estimation method uses a word alignment ma-
trix between f and e to extract the set of phrase pairs
that are consistent with the word alignment ma-
trix (see (Koehn et al, 2003) for more details). Once
the consistent phrase pairs have been extracted, the
phrase counts are updated. The word alignment ma-
trices required for the extraction of phrase pairs are
generated by means of the HMM-based models used
in the feature functions h3 and h4.
Inverse and direct HMM-based models are used
here for two purposes: to smooth the phrase-based
models via linear interpolation and to generate word
alignment matrices. The weights of the interpola-
tion can be estimated from a development corpus.
Equation (10) shows the expression of the probabil-
ity given by an inverse HMM-based model. The
probability includes lexical probabilities p(fj |ei)
and alignment probabilities p(aj |aj?1, l). Since the
alignment in the HMM-based model is determined
by a hidden variable, the EM algorithm is required
to estimate the parameters of the model (see (Och
and Ney, 2003)). However, the standard EM algo-
rithm is not appropriate to incrementally extend our
HMM-based models because it is designed to work
in batch training scenarios. To solve this problem,
we apply the incremental view of the EM algorithm
described in (Neal and Hinton, 1998). According
to (Och and Ney, 2003), the lexical probability for a
550
pair of words is given by the expression:
p(f |e) = c(f |e)?
f ? c(f ?|e)
(14)
where c(f |e) is the expected number of times that
the word e is aligned to the word f . The alignment
probability is defined in a similar way:
p(aj |aj?1, l) =
c(aj |aj?1, l)
?
a?j
c(a?j |aj?1, l)
(15)
where c(aj |aj?1, l) denotes the expected number of
times that the alignment aj has been seen after the
previous alignment aj?1 given a source sentence
composed of l words.
Given the equations (14) and (15), the set of suf-
ficient statistics for the inverse HMM-based model
consists of a set of expected counts (numerator and
denominator values are stored separately). Given a
new sentence pair (f , e), we execute a new iteration
of the incremental EM algorithm on the new sample
and collect the contributions to the expected counts.
The parameters of the direct HMM-based model
are estimated analogously to those of the inverse
HMM-based model. Once the direct and the inverse
HMM-based model parameters have been modified
due to the presentation of a new sentence pair to the
IMT system, both models are used to obtain word
alignments for the new sentence pair. The resulting
direct and inverse word alignment matrices are com-
bined by means of the symmetrization alignment op-
eration (Och and Ney, 2003) before extracting the
set of consistent phrase pairs.
HMM-based alignment models are used here
because, according to (Och and Ney, 2003)
and (Toutanova et al, 2002), they outperform IBM 1
to IBM 4 alignment models while still allowing the
exact calculation of the likelihood for a given sen-
tence pair.
The ? parameters of the geometric distributions
associated to the feature functions h5, h6 and h7 are
left fixed. Because of this, there are no sufficient
statistics to store for these feature functions.
Finally, the weights of the log-linear combination
are not modified due to the presentation of a new
sentence pair to the system. These weights can be
adjusted off-line by means of a development corpus
and well-known optimization techniques.
5 Experiments
This section describes the experiments that we car-
ried out to test our online IMT system.
5.1 Experimental setup
The experiments were performed using the XE-
ROX XRCE corpus (SchlumbergerSema S.A. et
al., 2001), which consists of translations of Xe-
rox printer manuals involving three different pairs
of languages: French-English, Spanish-English, and
German-English. The main features of these cor-
pora are shown in Table 1. Partitions into training,
development and test were performed. This corpus
is used here because it has been extensively used in
the literature on IMT to report results.
IMT experiments were carried out from English
to the other three languages.
5.2 Assessment criteria
The evaluation of the techniques presented in this
paper were carried out using the Key-stroke and
mouse-action ratio (KSMR) measure (Barrachina
et al, 2009). This is calculated as the number of
keystrokes plus the number of mouse movements
plus one more count per sentence (aimed at simulat-
ing the user action needed to accept the final transla-
tion), the sum of which is divided by the total num-
ber of reference characters. In addition to this, we
also used the well-known BLEU score (Papineni et
al., 2001) to measure the translation quality of the
first translation hypothesis produced by the IMT sys-
tem for each source sentence (which is automatically
generated without user intervention).
5.3 Online IMT results
To test the techniques proposed in this work, we
carried out experiments in two different scenarios.
In the first one, the first 10 000 sentences extracted
from the training corpora were interactively trans-
lated by means of an IMT system without any pre-
existent model stored in memory. Each time a new
sentence pair was validated, it was used to incremen-
tally train the system. Figures 3a, 3b and 3c show the
evolution of the KSMR with respect to the number
of sentence pairs processed by the IMT system; the
results correspond to the translation from English to
Spanish, French and German, respectively. In addi-

tion, for each language pair we interactively trans-
lated the original portion of the training corpus and
the same portion of the original corpus after being
randomly shuffled.
As these figures show, the results clearly demon-
strate that the IMT system is able to learn from
scratch. The results were similar for the three lan-
guages. It is also worthy of note that the obtained
results were better in all cases for the original cor-
pora than for the shuffled ones. This is because,
in the original corpora, similar sentences appear
more or less contiguosly (due to the organization of
the contents of the printer manuals). This circum-
stance increases the accuracy of the online learning,
since with the original corpora the number of lat-
eral effects ocurred between the translation of sim-
ilar sentences is decreased. The online learning of
a new sentence pair produces a lateral effect when
the changes in the probability given by the models
not only affect the newly trained sentence pair but
also other sentence pairs. A lateral effect can cause
that the system generates a wrong translation for a
given source sentence due to undesired changes in
the statistical models.
The accuracy were worse for shuffled corpora,
since shuffling increases the number of lateral ef-
fects that may occur between the translation of sim-
ilar sentences (because they no longer appear con-
tiguously). A good way to compare the quality of
different online IMT systems is to determine their
robustness in relation to sentence ordering. How-
ever, it can generally be expected that the sentences
to be translated in an interactive translation session
will be in a non-random order.
Alternatively, we carried out experiments in a dif-
ferent learning scenario. Specifically, the XEROX

the training corpora
test corpora were interactively translated from the
English language to the other three languages, com-
paring the performance of a batch IMT system with
552
that of an online IMT system. The batch IMT sys-
tem is a conventional IMT system which is not able
to take advantage of user feedback after each transla-
tion while the online IMT system uses the new sen-
tence pairs provided by the user to revise the sta-
tistical models. Both systems were initialized with
a log-linear model trained in batch mode by means
of the XEROX training corpora. The weights of the
log-linear combination were adjusted for the devel-
opment corpora by means of the downhill-simplex
algorithm. Table 2 shows the obtained results. The
table shows the BLEU score and the KSMR for the
batch and the online IMT systems (95% confidence
intervals are shown). The BLEU score was calcu-
lated from the first translation hypothesis produced
by the IMT system for each source sentence. The ta-
ble also shows the average online learning time (LT)
for each new sample presented to the system2. All
the improvements obtained with the online IMT sys-
tem were statistically significant. Also, the average
learning times clearly allow the system to be used in
a real-time scenario.

Finally, in Table 3 a comparison of the KSMR re-
sults obtained by the online IMT system with state-
of-the-art IMT systems is reported (95% confidence
intervals are shown). We compared our system with
those presented in (Barrachina et al, 2009): the
alignment templates (AT), the stochastic finite-state
transducer (SFST), and the phrase-based (PB) ap-
proaches to IMT. The results were obtained using
the same Xerox training and test sets (see Table 1)
for the four different IMT systems. Our system out-
performed the results obtained by these systems.
2All the experiments were executed on a PC with a 2.40 Ghz
Intel Xeon processor with 1GB of memory.

6 Conclusions
We have presented an online IMT system. The pro-
posed system is able to incrementally extend the sta-
tistical models involved in the translation process,
breaking technical limitations encountered in other
works. Empirical results show that our techniques
allow the IMT system to learn from scratch or from
previously estimated models.
One key aspect of the proposed system is the use
of HMM-based alignment models trained by means
of the incremental EM algorithm.
The incremental adjustment of the weights of the
log-linear models and other parameters have not
been tackled here. For the future we plan to incor-
porate this functionality into our IMT system.
The incremental techniques proposed here can
also be exploited to extend SMT systems (in fact,
our proposed IMT system is based on an incremen-
tally updateable SMT system). For the near future
we plan to study possible aplications of our tech-
niques in a fully automatic translation scenario.
Finally, it is worthy of note that the main ideas
presented here can be used in other interactive ap-
plications such as Computer Assisted Speech Tran-
scription, Interactive Image Retrieval, etc (see (Vi-
dal et al, 2007) for more information). In conclu-
sion, we think that the online learning techniques
proposed here can be the starting point for a new
generation of interactive pattern recognition systems
that are able to take advantage of user feedback.
