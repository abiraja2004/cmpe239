The primary goal of this basic research is to develop improved methods and models for acoustic recognition 
of continuous speech. The work has focussed on developing accurate and detailed mathematical models of phonemes 
and their coarticulation for the purpose of large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Important goals of this 
work are to achieve the highest possible word recognition accuracy in continuous peech and to develop methods 
for the rapid adaptation of phonetic models to the voice of a new speaker. 
Major Accomplishments 
? Developed context-depen~nt phonetic models based on the hidden Markov modeling (HMM)  formalism to 
describe the acoustic variability of speech due to coarticulation with neighboring phonemes. The method 
resulted in a reduction of the word error rate by a factor of two over using context-independent models. 
? Developed and demonstrated the effectiveness of the "time-synchronous" search strategy for finding the most 
likely sequence of words, given the input speech. 
? Incorporated the various techniques in a complete continuous peech recognition system, called BYBLOS, 
and demonstrated it first in 1986. It was, and continues to be, the highest-performing continuous recognition 
system for large vocabularies, with a recognition accuracy of 98% with a grammar of perplexity 60. The 
basic methodology of BYBLOS has since been adopted by other DARPA sites. 
? Developed a new formalism for phonetic modeling, called "'stochastic segment modeling", which can model 
the cowclation between different parts of a phoneme directly. Initial experiments with this model on context- 
independent phonetic units reduced the recognition error by a factor of two compared to the corresponding 
context-independent HMM models. However, the new method requires ignificantly more computation. 
? Developed a novel "'probabilistic spectral mapping" technique for rapid speaker adaptation whereby the 
phonetic models of a new speaker are estimated by performing a Wansformation on the phonetic models of 
a reference speaker, using only a small amount of speech from the new speaker. Using this technique, the 
recognition accuracy with only 2 minutes of training from the new speaker is equal to that usually achieved 
with 20 minutes of speaker-dependent training or with speaker-independent training (which requires peech 
from over 100 speakers). 
? With multiple reference models, the error rate with speaker adaptation is cut in half relative to the single- 
reference case. This constitutes the first time that speaker adaptation has been successful in improving 
performance over a speaker-independent system. 
? A new paradigm for speaker-independent training has been developed. Instead of using speech from over 100 
speakers, the new method uses 30 minutes from each of only a dozen speakers. This new, more practical, 
paradigm promises to be the key to future developments in improved speaker-independent r cognition.
