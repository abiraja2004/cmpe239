Abstract 
Corpus-based thesaurus construction for Mor-
phologically Rich Languages (MRL) is a com-
plex task, due to the morphological variability 
of MRL. In this paper we explore alternative 
term representations, complemented by cluster-
ing of morphological variants. We introduce a 
generic algorithmic scheme for thesaurus con-
struction in MRL, and demonstrate the empiri-
cal benefit of our methodology for a Hebrew 
thesaurus. 
1 Introduction 
Corpus-based thesaurus construction has been an 
active research area (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran 
and Moens, 2002; Kilgarriff, 2003; Rychly and 
Kilgarriff, 2007). Typically, two statistical ap-
proaches for identifying semantic relationships 
between words were investigated: first-order, co-
occurrence-based methods which assume that 
words that occur frequently together are topically 
related (Schutze and Pederson, 1997) and second-
order, distributional similarity methods (Hindle, 
1990; Lin, 1998; Gasperin et al 2001; Weeds and 
Weir, 2003; Kotlerman et al, 2010), which suggest 
that words occurring within similar contexts are 
semantically similar (Harris, 1968).  
While most prior work focused on English, we 
are interested in applying these methods to MRL. 
Such languages, Hebrew in our case, are character-
ized by highly productive morphology which may 
produce as many as thousands of word forms for a 
given root form.    
Thesauri usually provide related terms for each 
entry term (denoted target term). Since both target 
and related terms correspond to word lemmas, sta-
tistics collection from the corpus would be most 
directly applied at the lemma level as well, using a 
morphological analyzer and tagger (Linden and 
Piitulainen, 2004; Peirsman et al, 2008; Rapp, 
2009). However, due to the rich and challenging 
morphology of MRL, such tools often have limited 
performance. In our research, the accuracy of a 
state-of-the-art modern Hebrew tagger on a cross 
genre corpus was only about 60%. 
Considering such limited performance of mor-
phological processing, we propose a schematic 
methodology for generating a co-occurrence based 
thesaurus in MRL. In particular, we propose and 
investigate three options for term representation, 
namely surface form, lemma and multiple lemmas, 
supplemented with clustering of term variants. 
While the default lemma representation is depend-
ent on tagger performance, the two other represen-
tations avoid choosing the right lemma for each 
word occurrence. Instead, the multiple-lemma rep-
resentation assumes that the right analysis will ac-
cumulate enough statistical prominence throughout 
the corpus, while the surface representation solves 
morphological disambiguation "in retrospect", by 
clustering term variants at the end of the extraction 
process. As the methodology provides a generic 
scheme for exploring the alternative representation 
levels, each corpus and language-specific tool set 
might yield a different optimal configuration. 
2 Methodology  
Thesauri usually contain thousands of entries, 
termed here target terms. Each entry holds a list of 
related terms, covering various semantic relations. 
In this paper we assume that the list of target terms 
59
is given as input, and focus on the process of ex-
tracting a ranked list of candidate related terms 
(termed candidate terms) for each target term. The 
top ranked candidates may be further examined 
(manually) by a lexicographer, who will select the 
eventual related terms for the thesaurus entry. 
Our methodology was applied for statistical 
measures of first order similarity (word co-
occurrence). These statistics consider the number 
of times each candidate term co-occurs with the 
target term in the same document, relative to their 
total frequencies in the corpus. Common co-
occurrence metrics are Dice coefficient (Smadja et 
al, 1996), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) 
(Church and Hanks, 1990) and log-likelihood test 
(Dunning, 1993). 
2.1 Term Representation 
Statistical extraction is affected by term 
representation in the corpus. Usually, related terms 
in a thesaurus are lemmas, which can be identified 
by morphological disambiguation tools. However, 
we present two other approaches for term 
representation (either a target term or a candidate 
related term), which are less dependent on 
morphological processing.  
Typically, a morphological analyzer produces 
all possible analyses for a given token in the cor-
pus. Then, a Part Of Speech (POS) tagger selects 
the most probable analysis and solves morphology 
disambiguation. However, considering the poor 
performance of the POS tagger on our corpus, we 
distinguish between these two analysis levels. 
Consequently, we examined three levels of term 
representation: (i) Surface form (surface) (ii) Best 
lemma, as indentified by a POS tagger (best), and 
(iii) All possible lemmas, produced by a morpho-
logical analyzer (all). 
2.2 Algorithmic Scheme 
We used the following algorithmic scheme for the-
saurus construction. Our input is a target term in 
one of the possible term representations (surface, 
best or all). For each target term we retrieve all the 
documents in the corpus where the target term ap-
pears. Then, we define a set of candidate terms that 
consists of all the terms that appear in all these 
documents (this again for each of the three possible 
term representations). Next, a co-occurrence score 
between the target term and each of the candidates 
is calculated. Then, candidates are sorted, and the 
highest rated candidate terms are clustered into 
lemma-oriented clusters. Finally, we rank the clus-
ters according to their members' co-occurrence 
scores and the highest rated clusters become relat-
ed terms in the thesaurus. 
Figure 1 presents the algorithm?s pseudo code. 
The notion rep(term) is used to describe the possi-
ble term representations and may be either surface, 
best or all. In our experiments, when 
rep(target_term)=best, the correct lemma was 
manually assigned (assuming a lexicographer in-
volvement with each thesaurus entry in our set-
ting). While, when rep(word)=best, the most prob-
able lemma is assigned by the tagger (since there 
are numerous candidates for each target term we 
cannot resort the manual involvement for each of 
them).  The two choices for rep(term) are inde-
pendent, resulting in nine possible configurations 
of the algorithm for representing both the target 
term and the candidate terms. Thus, these 9 con-
figurations cover the space of possibilities for term 
representation. Exploring all of them in a systemat-
ic manner would reveal the best configuration in a 
particular setting.

2.3 Clustering 
The algorithm of Figure 1 suggests clustering the 
extracted candidates before considering them for 
the thesaurus. Clustering aims at grouping together 
related terms with the same lemma into clusters, 
using some measure of morphological equivalence. 
Accordingly, an equivalence measure between re-
lated terms needs to be defined, and a clustering

algorithm needs to be selected. Each obtained clus-
ter is intended to correspond to the lemma of a sin-
gle candidate term. Obviously, clustering is mostly 
needed for surface-level representation, in order to 
group all different inflections of the same lemma. 
Yet, we note that it was also found necessary for 
the lemma-level representations, because the tag-
ger often identifies slightly different lemmas for 
the same term.  
The equivalence measure is used for building a 
graph representation of the related terms. We rep-
resented each term by a vertex and added an edge 
between each pair of terms that were deemed 
equivalent. We investigated alternative equiva-
lence measures for measuring the morphological 
distance between two vertices in our graph. We 
considered the string edit distance measure and 
suggested two morphological-based equivalence 
measures. The first measure, given two vertices' 
terms, extracts all possible lemmas for each term 
and searches for an overlap of at least one lemma. 
The second measure considers the most probable 
lemma of the vertices' terms and checks whether 
these lemmas are equal. The probability of a lem-
ma was defined as the sum of probabilities for all 
morphological analyses containing the lemma, us-
ing a morpho-lexical context-independent proba-
bilities approximation (Goldberg et al, 2008). The 
clustering was done by finding the connected com-
ponents in our graph of terms using the JUNG1 
implementation (WeakComponentVertexClusterer 
algorithm with default parameters). The connected 
components are expected to correspond to different 
lemmas of terms. Hierarchical clustering methods 
(Jain et al, 1999) were examined as well (Single-
link and Complete-link clustering), but they were 
inferior.  
After applying the clustering algorithm, we re-
ranked the clusters aiming to get the best clusters 
at the top of clusters list. We investigated two scor-
ing approaches for cluster ranking; maximization 
and averaging. The maximization approach assigns 
the maximal score of the cluster members as the 
cluster score. While the averaging approach as-
signs the average of the cluster members' scores as 
the cluster score. The score obtained by either of 
the approaches may be scaled by the cluster length, 
to account for the accumulative impact of all class

of the candidate term).  
3 Case Study: Cross-genre Hebrew 
Thesaurus 
Our research targets the construction of a cross 
genre thesaurus for the Responsa project 2 . The 
corpus includes questions posed to rabbis along 
with their detailed rabbinic answers, consisting of 
various genres and styles. It contains 76,710 arti-
cles and about 100 million word tokens, and was 
used for previous IR and NLP research (Choueka, 
1972; Fraenkel, 1976; Choueka et al, 1987; Kernel 
et al 2008). 
Unfortunately, due to the different genres in the 
Responsa corpus, available tools for Hebrew pro-
cessing perform poorly on this corpus. In a prelim-
inary experiment, the POS tagger (Adler and 
Elhadad, 2006) accuracy on the Responsa Corpus 
was less than 60%, while the accuracy of the same 
tagger on modern Hebrew corpora is ~90% (Bar-
Haim et al, 2007).  
For this project, we utilized the MILA Hebrew 
Morphological Analyzer3 (Itai and Wintner, 2008; 
Yona and Wintner, 2008) and the (Adler and 
Elhadad 2006) POS tagger for lemma representa-
tion. The latter had two important characteristics: 
The first is flexibility- This tagger allows adapting 
the estimates of the prior (context-independent) 
probability of each morphological analysis in an 
unsupervised manner, from an unlabeled corpus of 
the target domain (Goldberg et al, 2008). The se-
cond advantage is its mechanism for analyzing un-
known tokens (Adler et al, 2008). Since about 
50% of the words in our corpora are unknown 
(with respect to MILA's lexicon), such mechanism 
is essential.  
For statistics extraction, we used Lucene4. We 
took the top 1000 documents retrieved for the tar-
get term and extracted candidate terms from them. 
Dice coefficient was used as our co-occurrence 
measure, most probable lemma was considered for 
clustering equivalence, and clusters were ranked 
based on maximization, where the maximal score 
was multiplied by cluster size.

4 Evaluation 
4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Measures 
The results reported in this paper were obtained 
from a sample of 108 randomly selected terms 
from a list of 5000 terms, extracted from two pub-
licly available term lists: the University of Haifa?s 
entry list5 and Hebrew Wikipedia entries6. 
In our experiments, we compared the perfor-
mance of the alternative 9 configurations by four 
commonly used IR measures: precision (P), rela-
tive recall (R), F1, and Average Precision (AP). 
The scores were macro-averaged. We assumed that 
our automatically-generated candidate terms will 
be manually filtered, thus, recall becomes more 
important than precision. Since we do not have any 
pre-defined thesaurus, we evaluated the relative-
recall. Our relative-recall considered the number of 
suitable related terms from the output of all meth-
ods as the full set of related terms. As our system 
yielded a ranked sequence of related terms clusters, 
we also considered their ranking order. Therefore, 
we adopted the recall-oriented AP for ranking 
(Voorhees and Harman, 1999). 
4.2  Annotation Scheme 
The output of the statistical extraction is a ranked 
list of clusters of candidate related terms. Since 
manual annotation is expensive and time consum-
ing, we annotated for the gold standard the top 15 
clusters constructed from the top 50 candidate 
terms, for each target term. Then, an annotator 
judged each of the clusters' terms. A cluster was 
considered as relevant if at least one of its terms 
was judged relevant7. 
4.3 Results 
Table 1 compares the performance of all nine term 
representation configurations. Due to data sparse-
ness, the lemma-based representations of the target 
term outperform its surface representation. How-
ever, the best results were obtained from candidate 
representation at the surface level, which was 
complemented by grouping term variants to lem-
mas in the clustering phase.

 This was justified by empirical results that found only a few 
clusters with some terms judged positive and others negative

Furthermore, we note that the target representa-
tion by all possible lemmas (all) yielded the best R 
and AP scores, which we consider as most im-
portant for the thesaurus construction setting. The 
improvement over the common default best lemma 
representation, for both target and candidate, is 
notable (7 points) and is statistically significant 
according to the two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test (Wilcoxon, 1945) at the 0.01 level for AP and 
0.05 for R.  
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
We presented a methodological scheme for ex-
ploring alternative term representations in statisti-
cal thesaurus construction for MRL, complemented 
by lemma-oriented clustering at the end of the pro-
cess. The scheme was investigated for a Hebrew 
cross-genre corpus, but can be generically applied 
in other settings to find the optimal configuration 
in each case. 
We plan to adopt our methodology to second 
order distributional similarity methods as well. In 
this case there is an additional dimension, namely 
feature representation, whose representation level 
should be explored as well. In addition, we plan to 
extend our methods to deal with Multi Word Ex-
pressions (MWE).
