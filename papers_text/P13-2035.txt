Abstract
In this paper, we relook at the problem
of pronunciation of English words using
native phone set. Specifically, we in-
vestigate methods of pronouncing English
words using Telugu phoneset in the con-
text of Telugu Text-to-Speech. We com-
pare phone-phone substitution and word-
phone mapping for pronunciation of En-
glish words using Telugu phones. We are
not considering other than native language
phoneset in all our experiments. This dif-
ferentiates our approach from other works
in polyglot speech synthesis.
1 Introduction
The objective of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system is
to convert a given text input into a spoken wave-
form. Text processing and waveform generation
are the two main components of a TTS system.
The objective of the text processing component is
to convert the given input text into an appropriate
sequence of valid phonemic units. These phone-
mic units are then realized by the waveform gener-
ation component. For high quality speech synthe-
sis, it is necessary that the text processing unit pro-
duce the appropriate sequence of phonemic units,
for the given input text.
There has been a rise in the phenomenon of
?code mixing? (Romaine and Kachru, 1992). This
is a phenomenon where lexical items of two lan-
guages appear in a single sentence. In a multi-
lingual country such as India, we commonly find
Indian language text being freely interspersed with
English words and phrases. This is particularly no-
ticeable in the case of text from web sources like
blogs, tweets etc. An informal analysis of a Telugu
blog on the web showed that around 20-30% of the
text is in English (ASCII) while the remaining is
in Telugu (Unicode). Due to the growth of ?code
mixing? it has become necessary to develop strate-
gies for dealing with such multilingual text in TTS
systems. These multilingual TTS systems should
be capable of synthesizing utterances which con-
tain foreign language words or word groups, with-
out sounding unnatural.
The different ways of achieving multilingual
TTS synthesis are as follows (Traber et al, 1999;
Latorre et al, 2006; Campbell, 1998; Campbell,
2001).
1. Separate TTS systems for each language:
In this paradigm, a seperate TTS system is
built for each language under consideration.
When the language of the input text changes,
the TTS system also has to be changed.
This can only be done between two sen-
tences/utterances and not in the middle of a
sentence.
2. Polyglot speech synthesis:
This is a type of multilingual speech syn-
thesis achieved using a single TTS system.
This method involves recording a multi lan-
guage speech corpus by someone who is flu-
ent in multiple languages. This speech cor-
pus is then used to build a multilingual TTS
system. The primary issue with polyglot
speech synthesis is that it requires develop-
ment of a combined phoneset, incorporating
phones from all the languages under consid-
eration. This is a time consuming process
requiring linguistic knowledge of both lan-
guages. Also, finding a speaker fluent in mul-
196
tiple languages is not an easy task.
3. Phone mapping:
This type of multilingual synthesis is based
upon phone mapping, whereby the phones
of the foreign language are substituted with
the closest sounding phones of the primary
language. This method results in a strong
foreign accent while synthesizing the foreign
words. This may not always be acceptable.
Also, if the sequence of the mapped phones
does not exist or is not frequently occurring
in the primary language, then the synthesized
output quality would be poor. Hence, an aver-
age polyglot synthesis technique using HMM
based synthesis and speaker adaptation has
been proposed (Latorre et al, 2006). Such
methods make use of speech data from dif-
ferent languages and different speakers.
In this paper, we relook at the problem of pro-
nunciation of English words using native phone
set. Specifically, we investigate methods of pro-
nouncing English words using Telugu phoneset in
the context of Telugu Text-to-Speech. Our moti-
vation for doing so, comes from our understand-
ing of how humans pronounce foreign words while
speaking. The speaker maps the foreign words to
a sequence of phones of his/her native language
while pronouncing that foreign word. For exam-
ple, a native speaker of Telugu, while pronounc-
ing an English word, mentally maps the English
word to a sequence of Telugu phones as opposed
to simply substituting English phones with the cor-
responding Telugu phones. Also, the receiver of
the synthesized speech would be a Telugu native
speaker, who may not have the knowledge of En-
glish phone set. Hence, approximating an English
word using Telugu phone sequence may be more
acceptable for a Telugu native speaker.
We compare phone-phone substitution and
word-phone mapping (also referred to LTS rules)
for the pronunciation of English words using Tel-
ugu phones. We are not considering other than
native language phoneset in all our experiments.
This differentiates our work from other works in
polyglot speech synthesis.

glish phone-Telugu phone mapping and English
word-Telugu phone mapping, along with the cor-
responding IPA transcription. The English word-
Telugu phone mapping is not a one to one map-
ping, as it is in the case of English phone-Telugu
phone mapping. Each letter has a correspondence
with one or more than one phones. As some let-
ters do not have a equivalent pronunciation sound
(the letter is not mapped to any phone) the term
epsilon is used whenever there is a letter which
does not have a mapping with a phone.
To compare word-phone (W-P) mapping and
phone-phone (P-P) mapping, we manually pre-
pared word-phone and phone-phone mappings for
10 bilingual utterances and synthesized them us-
ing our baseline Telugu TTS system. We then per-
formed perceptual listening evaluations on these
synthesized utterances, using five native speakers
of Telugu as the subjects of the evaluations. The
perceptual listening evaluations were setup both
as MOS (mean opinion score) evaluations and as
ABX evaluations. An explanation of MOS and
ABX evaluations is given in Section 4. Table 2
shows that results of these evaluations.

An examination of the results in Table 2 shows
that manually prepared word-phone mapping is
preferred perceptually when compared to manual
phone-phone mapping. The MOS score of 3.48
indicates that native speakers accept W-P mapping
for pronouncing English words in Telugu TTS.
For the remainder of this paper, we focus ex-
clusively on word-phone mapping. We propose a
method of automatically generating these word-
phone mapping from data. We experiment our
approach by generating a word-phone mapping
which maps each English word to a Telugu phone
sequence (henceforth called EW-TP mapping).
We report the accuracy of learning the word-phone
mappings both on a held out test set and on a test
set from a different domain. Finally, we incorpo-
rate this word-phone mapping in our baseline Tel-
ugu TTS system and demonstrate its usefulness by
means of perceptual listening tests.
3 Automatic generation of word-phone
mapping
We have previously mentioned that letter to phone
mapping is not a one to one mapping. Each let-
ter may have a correspondence with one or more
than one phones, or it may not have correspon-
dence with any phone. As we require a fixed sized
learning vector to build a model for learning word-
phone mapping rules, we need to align the letter
(graphemic) and phone sequences. For this we use
the automatic epsilon scattering method.
3.1 Automatic Epsilon Scattering Method
The idea in automatic epsilon scattering is to esti-
mate the probabilities for one letter (grapheme) G
to match with one phone P , and then use string
alignment to introduce epsilons maximizing the
probability of the word?s alignment path. Once
the all the words have been aligned, the associa-
tion probability is calculated again and so on until
convergence. The algorithm for automatic epsilon
scattering is given below (Pagel et al, 1998).
3.2 Evaluation and Results
Once the alignment between the each word and the
corresponding phone sequence was complete, we
built two phone models using Classification and
Regression Trees (CART). For the first model, we
used data from the CMU pronunciation dictionary
where each English word had been aligned to a se-
quence of US English phones (EW-EP mapping).
Algorithm for Epsilon Scattering :
/*Initialize prob(G,P ) the probability of G
matching P*/
1. for each wordi in training set
count with string alignment all possible G/P
association for all possible epsilon positions in the
phonetic transcription
/* EM loop */
2. for each wordi in training set
alignment path = argmax
?
i,j
P (Gi, Pj)
compute probnew(G,P ) on alignment path
3. if(prob 6= probnew) go to 2
The second model was the EW-TP mapping.
Once both the models had been built, they were
used to predict the mapped phone sequences for
each English word in the test data. For the pur-
poses of testing, we performed the prediction on
both held out test data as well as on test data from
a different domain. The held out test data was pre-
pared by removing every ninth word from the lex-
icon.
As we knew the correct phone sequence for
each word in the test data, a ground truth against
which to compute the accuracy of prediction was
available. We measured the accuracy of the pre-
diction both at the letter level and at the word level.
At the letter level, the accuracy was computed by
counting the number of times the predicted letter
to phone mapping matched with the ground truth.
For computing the accuracy at the word level, we
counted the number of times the predicted phone
sequence of each word in the test data matched
with the actual phone sequence for that word (de-
rived from the ground truth). We also varied the
size of the training data and then computed the
prediction accuracy for each model. We did so in
order to study the effect of training data size on the
prediction accuracy.
Tables 3, 4 show the accuracy of the models.
An examination of the results in the two tables
shows that incrementally increasing the size of the
training data results in an increase of the predic-
tion accuracy. The native speakers of Indian lan-
guages prefer to speak what is written. As a result
there are fewer variations in word-phone mapping
as compared to US English. This is reflected in
our results, which show that the word level pre-
diction accuracy is higher for EW-TP mapping as
compared to EW-EP mapping.

4 Integrating word-phone mapping rules
in TTS
For the purpose of perceptual evaluations we built
a baseline TTS systems for Telugu using the
HMM based speech synthesis technique (Zen et
al., 2007).
To conduct perceptual evaluations of the word-
phone mapping rules built from data in 3.2, we
incorporated these rules in our Telugu TTS sys-
tem. This system is henceforth refered to as T A.
A set of 25 bilingual sentences were synthesized
by the Telugu TTS, and ten native speakers of Tel-
ugu performed perceptual evaluations on the syn-
thesized utterances. As a baseline, we also synthe-
sized the same 25 sentences by incorporating man-
ually written word-phone mapping for the English
words, instead of using the automatically gener-
ated word-phone mapping rules. We refer to this
system as T M.
The perceptual evaluations were set up both
as MOS (mean opinion score) evaluations and as
ABX evaluations. In the MOS evaluations, the
listeners were asked to rate the synthesized utter-
ances from all systems on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being
worst and 5 best), and the average scores for each
system was calculated. This average is the MOS
score for that system. In a typical ABX evalua-
tion, the listeners are presented with the the same
set of utterances synthesized using two systems A
and B, and are asked to mark their preference for
either A or B. The listeners also have an option of
marking no preference. In this case, the listeners
were asked to mark their preference between T A
and T M. The results of the perceptual evaluations
are shown in Table 5.

An examination of the results shows that per-
ceptually there is no significant preference for the
manual system over the automated system. The
MOS scores also show that there is not much sig-
nificant difference between the ratings of the man-
ual and the automated system.
5 Conclusions
In this paper we present a method of automati-
cally learning word-phone mapping rules for syn-
thesizing foreign words occurring in text. We
show the effectiveness of the method by com-
puting the accuracy of prediction and also by
means of perceptual evaluations. The synthe-
sized multilingual wave files are available for
