Abstract
This paper explores the relationship between explicit
and predictive models of incremental speech under-
standing in a dialogue system that supports a finite
set of user utterance meanings. We present a method
that enables the approximation of explicit under-
standing using information implicit in a predictive
understanding model for the same domain. We show
promising performance for this method in a corpus
evaluation, and discuss its practical application and
annotation costs in relation to some alternative ap-
proaches.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing interest among
researchers in methods for incremental natural language
understanding (NLU) for spoken dialogue systems; see
e.g. (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Sagae et al, 2009;
Schlangen et al, 2009; Heintze et al, 2010; DeVault et
al., 2011a; Selfridge et al, 2012). This work has gen-
erally been motivated by a desire to make dialogue sys-
tems more efficient and more natural, by enabling them to
provide lower latency responses (Skantze and Schlangen,
2009), human-like feedback such as backchannels that in-
dicate how well the system is understanding user speech
(DeVault et al, 2011b; Traum et al, 2012), and more in-
teractive response capabilities such as collaborative com-
pletions of user utterances (DeVault et al, 2011a), more
adaptive handling of interruptions (Buschmeier et al,
2012), and others.
This paper builds on techniques developed in previous
work that has adopted a predictive approach to incremen-
tal NLU (DeVault et al, 2011a). On this approach, at
specific moments while a user?s speech is in progress,
an attempt is made to predict what the full meaning of
the complete user utterance will be. Predictive models
can be contrasted with explicit approaches to incremen-
tal NLU. We use the term explicit understanding to refer
to approaches that attempt to determine the meaning that
has been expressed explicitly in the user?s partial utter-
ance so far (without predicting further aspects of mean-
ing to come). Explicit understanding of partial utterances
can be implemented using statistical classification or se-
quential tagging models (Heintze et al, 2010).
Both predictive and explicit incremental NLU capabil-
ities can be valuable in a dialogue system. Prediction
can support specific response capabilities, such as sys-
tem completion of user utterances (DeVault et al, 2011a)
and reduced response latency.1 However, explicit models
support additional and complementary capabilities. For
instance, depending on the application domain (Heintze
et al, 2010) and on the individual utterance (DeVault et
al., 2011b), it may be difficult for a system to predict a
user?s impending meaning with confidence. Neverthe-
less, it may often be possible for systems to determine
the meaning of what a user has said so far, and to take
action based on this partial understanding. As one exam-
ple, items in a user interface could be highlighted when
mentioned by a user (Bu? and Schlangen, 2011). An-
other capability would be to provide grounding feedback,
such as verbal back-channels or head nods (in embod-
ied systems), to indicate when the system is understand-
ing the user?s meaning (Traum et al, 2012). Explicit ut-
terance meanings also allow a system to distinguish be-
tween meaning that has been expressed and meaning that
is merely implied or inferred, which may be less reliable.
In the near future, as incremental processing capabilities
in dialogue systems grow, it may prove valuable for di-
alogue systems to combine both predictive and explicit
incremental understanding capabilities.
In this paper, we present a technique for approximating
a user?s explicit meaning using an existing predictive un-
derstanding framework (DeVault et al, 2011a). The spe-
cific new contributions in this paper are (1) to show that
1A simple approach to reducing response latency is to begin to plan
a response to the predicted meaning while the user is still speaking.
1092
an estimate of a user?s explicit utterance meaning can be
derived from this kind of predictive understanding model
(Section 2); (2) to quantify the performance of this new
method in a corpus evaluation (Section 3); (3) to provide
concrete examples and discussion of the annotation costs
associated with implementing this technique, in relation
to some alternative approaches to explicit understanding
(Section 4). Our results and discussion show that the
proposed method offers promising performance, has rela-
tively low annotation costs, and enables explicit and pre-
dictive understanding to be easily combined within a di-
alogue system. It may therefore be a useful incremental
understanding technique for some dialogue systems.
2 Technical Approach and Data Set
In Sections 2.1-2.3, we briefly summarize the data set and
approach to predictive incremental NLU (DeVault et al,
2011a) that serves as the starting point for the new work
in this paper. Sections 2.4 and 2.5 present our new ap-
proach to explicit understanding based on this approach.
2.1 Data set
For the experiments reported here, we use a corpus of
user utterances collected with the SASO-EN spoken dia-
logue system (Hartholt et al, 2008; Traum et al, 2008).
Briefly, this system is designed to allow a trainee to prac-
tice multi-party negotiation skills by engaging in face to
face negotiation with virtual humans. The scenario in-
volves a negotiation about the possible re-location of a
medical clinic in an Iraqi village. A human trainee plays
the role of a US Army captain, and there are two virtual
humans that he negotiates with: Doctor Perez, the head
of an NGO clinic, and a local village elder, al-Hassan.
The captain?s main objective is to convince the doctor and
the elder to move the clinic out of an unsafe marketplace
area.
The corpus used for the experiments in this paper in-
cludes 3,826 training and 449 testing utterances drawn
from user dialogues in this domain. The corpus and its se-
mantic annotation are described in (DeVault et al, 2010;
DeVault et al, 2011a). All user utterances have been au-
dio recorded, transcribed, and manually annotated with
the correct NLU output frame for the entire utterance.
(We discuss the cost of this annotation in Section 4.) Each
NLU output frame contains a set of attributes and values
that represent semantic information linked to a domain-
specific ontology and task model (Traum, 2003). Exam-
ples of the NLU output frames are included in Figures 2,
3, and 5.
2.2 Predictive incremental NLU
This approach uses a predictive incremental NLU mod-
ule, mxNLU (Sagae et al, 2009; DeVault et al, 2011a),
which is based on maximum entropy classification. The
approach treats entire individual frames as output classes,
and extracts input features from partial ASR results. To
define the incremental understanding problem, the audio
of the utterances in the training data were fed through
an ASR module, PocketSphinx (Huggins-Daines et al,
2006), in 200 millisecond chunks, and each partial ASR
result produced by the ASR was recorded. Each par-
tial ASR result then serves as an incremental input to
mxNLU. NLU is predictive in the sense that, for each
partial ASR result, the task of mxNLU is to produce as
output the complete frame that has been associated by a
human annotator with the user?s complete utterance, even
if that utterance has not yet been fully processed by the
ASR.
The human annotation defines a finite set S =
{S1, ..., SN} of possible NLU output frames, where each
frame Si = {e1, ..., en} is a set of key-value pairs or
frame elements. For notation, a user utterance u generally
creates a sequence of m partial ASR results ?r1, ..., rm?,
where each ASR result rj is a partial text such as we need
to move. Let Gu denote the correct (or ?gold?) frame for
the complete utterance u. For each result rj and for each
complete frame Si, the maximum entropy model pro-
vides P (Gu = Si|rj). The NLU output frame SNLUj is
the complete frame for which this probability is highest.
2.3 Performance of predictive incremental NLU
The performance of this predictive incremental NLU
framework has been evaluated using the training and
test portions of the SASO-EN data set described in Sec-
tion 2.1. Performance is quantified by looking at pre-
cision, recall, and F-score of the frame elements that
compose the predicted (SNLUj ) and correct (Gu) frames
for each partial ASR result. When evaluated over all
the 5,736 partial ASR results for the 449 test utterances,
the precision/recall/F-Score of this predictive NLU, in
relation to the complete frames, are 0.67/0.47/0.56, re-
spectively. When evaluated on only the ASR results
for complete test utterances, these scores increase to
0.81/0.71/0.76, respectively.
2.4 Assigning probability to frame elements
An interesting question is whether we can use this model
to attach useful probabilities not only to complete pre-
dicted frames but also to the individual frame elements
that make up those frames. To explore this, for each par-
tial ASR result rj in each utterance u, and for each frame
element e in SASO-EN, let us model the probability that
e will be part of the correct frame for the complete utter-
ance as:
P (e ? Gu|rj) =
?

Figure 1: Calibration of frame element probabilities.
This method derives the probability of frame elements
from the probabilities assigned to the possible frames that
contain them. Computing this sum is straightforward in a
finite semantic domain such as SASO-EN.
We computed this probability for all frame elements
e and all partial ASR results rj in our test set, yielding
approximately 478,000 probability values. We grouped
these probability values into bins of size 0.05, and cal-
culated the frequency with which the frame elements in
each bin were indeed present in the correct frame Gu for
the relevant utterance u. The results are presented in Fig-
ure 1, which shows that the probability values derived
from Equation (1) are relatively ?well calibrated?, in the
sense that the relative frequency with which a frame el-
ement is in the final frame is very close to the numeric
probability assigned by Equation (1). The figure also
shows how frequently the model assigns various proba-
bility ranges to frame elements (blue dotted line, plotted
against the secondary right axis). Note that most frame
elements are assigned very little probability for most par-
tial ASR results.
We conclude from these observations that the probabil-
ities assigned by (1) could indeed carry useful informa-
tion about the likelihood that individual key values will
be present in the complete utterance meaning.
2.5 Selecting probable frame elements
In exploring the model of frame element probabilities
given in Equation (1), we observed that often the reason
a frame element has lower probability, at a given point
within a user utterance, is that it is a prediction rather than
something that has been expressed explicitly. Building on
this observation, our technique for estimating the user?s
explicit meaning uses a probability threshold to select
those individual frame elements which are most likely to
be in the frame for a complete utterance, according to the
predictive model. That is, at each partial result rj , we
estimate the user?s explicit meaning using a constructed
frame:
SSUBj = {e|P (e ? Gu|rj) ? ?} (2)
This approximation could work well if, in practice, the
most probable frame elements prove to match fairly
closely the user?s non-incremental utterance meaning at
the point this frame is constructed. We evaluate this in
the next section.
Note that, in general, the returned subset of frame
elements may not be identical to any complete frame
Si ? S; rather it will correspond to parts of these com-
plete frames or ?subframes?.
3 Performance Evaluation
To evaluate this technique, we constructed subsets of
frame elements or ?explicit subframes? using Equation
(2) and various minimum probability thresholds ? for par-
tial ASR results in our test set. We then compared the
resulting subframes both to the final complete frame Gu
for each utterance u, and also to manually annotated sub-

frames that represent human judgments of explicit incre-
mental utterance meaning.
To collect these judgments, we hand-annotated a word-
meaning alignment for 50 random utterances in our test
set.2 To perform this annotation, successively larger pre-
fixes of each utterance transcript were mapped to succes-
sively larger subframes of the full frame for the complete
utterance. The annotated subframes for each utterance
prefix were selected to be explicit; they include only those
frame elements that are explicitly expressed in the corre-
sponding prefix of the user?s utterance. (We discuss the
cost of this annotation in Section 4.)
We provide a simple concrete example in Figure 2.
This example shows two partial ASR results during
an utterance of hello elder by a user. For each par-
tial ASR result, three frames are indicated horizon-
tally. At the right, labeled ?Annotated subframe?, we
show the human judgment of explicit incremental ut-
terance meaning for this partial utterance. Our hu-
man judge has indicated that the word hello corresponds
to the frame element <S>.sem.speechact.type
greeting, and that the words hello elder correspond
to an expanded frame that includes the frame element
<S>.addressee elder-al-hassan.
At the left, labeled ?Explicit subframe?, we show
the subframe selected by Equation (2) for each par-
tial ASR result, with threshold ? = 0.5. A relevant
background fact for this example is that in this sce-
nario, the user can generally address either of two vir-
tual humans who are present, Doctor Perez or Elder
Al-Hassan. After the user has said hello, the frame
element <S>.sem.speechact.type greeting is
assigned probability 0.813 by Equation (1), and only this
frame element appears in the explicit subframe.
In the middle, labeled ?Predicted complete frame?, the
figure also shows the full predicted frame from mxNLU
at each point. After the user has said hello, the full
predicted output includes an additional frame element,
<S>.addressee doctor-perez, indicating a pre-
diction that the addressee of this user utterance will be
Doctor Perez rather than Elder al-Hassan. However, the
2Note that no utterances in our training set were annotated.
probability assigned to this prediction by Equation (1) is
less than 0.5, and so this predicted frame element is ex-
cluded from the explicit subframe. And indeed, this is the
correct explicit representation of the meaning of hello in
this system.
This simple example illustrates how our proposed tech-
nique can enable a dialogue system to have access to both
explicit and predicted utterance meaning as a user?s ut-
terance progresses. An excerpt from a more complex
utterance is given in Figure 3. This example shows in-
cremental outputs for two partial ASR results during a
user utterance of we will provide transportation at no
cost. In this example, the explicit subframe for we
will includes frame elements that convey that the cap-
tain (i.e. the user) is promising to do something. This
subframe does not exactly match the human judgment
of explicit meaning at the right, which does not include
at this point the <S>.sem.agent captain-kirk
and <S>.sem.type event frame elements. How-
ever, the explicit subframe more closely matches the hu-
man judgment than does the predicted complete frame
from mxNLU (middle column), which includes an in-
correct prediction that the captain is promising to de-
liver medical supplies (represented by the key values
<S>.sem.event deliver and <S>.sem.theme
medical-supplies). For the next partial ASR re-
sult shown in the figure, the explicit subframe correctly
adds several additional frame elements which formalize
the meaning of the phrase provide transportation in this
scenario as having the army move the clinic out of the
market area.
To understand more quantitatively how well this tech-
nique works, we evaluated this technique in the SASO-
EN test corpus, using different probability thresholds in
the range [0.5,1.0). We present the results in Figure 4. To
understand the effect of the threshold ? , note that, in gen-
eral, the effect of selecting a higher threshold should be to
?cherry pick? those frame elements which are most likely
to appear in the complete frame Gu, thereby increasing
precision while decreasing recall of the frame elements in
SSUBj in relation to Gu. In the figure, we can see that this
is indeed the case. The lines marked ?(complete frame)?

in the figure evaluate the returned subframes in relation
to the complete frameGu associated with the user?s com-
plete utterance. We see that this method enables us to
select subsets of frame elements that are most likely to
appear in Gu: by increasing the threshold, it is possible
to return subframes which are of increasingly higher pre-
cision in relation to the final frame Gu, but that also have
lower recall.
We also evaluated the returned subframes in relation to
the hand-annotated subframes, to assess its performance
at identifying the user?s explicit meaning. For an utter-
ance u that generates partial ASR results ?r1, ..., rm?,
we denote the hand-annotated subframe corresponding to
partial ASR result rj by GSUBj . In the lines marked ?(an-
notated subframe)?, we show the precision, recall, and
F-score of the explicit subframe for each ASR result rj
in relation to the annotated subframe GSUBj .
As a first observation, note that at any threshold level,
the explicit subframes do better at recalling the hand-
annotated subframe elements than they do at recalling the
complete frame elements. This means our new method is
better at recalling what has been said already by the user
than it is at predicting what will be said, as intended. We
have seen two examples of this already, for the partial
ASR result hello in Figure 2, and for the partial ASR re-
sult we will in Figure 3.
A second observation in Figure 4 is that precision re-
mains better against the complete utterance frame than
against the hand-annotated subframe (at all threshold lev-
els). This indicates that the explicit subframes are often
still predicting some aspects of the full frame. An exam-
ple of this is given in Figure 5, where the user?s partial
utterance we need to is assigned an explicit subframe that
includes frame elements describing an event of moving
the clinic, which the user has not said explicitly. This
happens because, in the SASO-EN domain, in fact there
is nothing else that the interlocutors need to do besides
move the clinic. So based on the NLU training data,
the data-driven probabilities assigned by Equation (1) de-
scribe the additional frame elements as about as probable
as the ones capturing the we need to part of the semantics
(given at the right).
Finally, a third observation is that overall, the preci-
sion, recall, and F-score results against the annotated sub-
frames using our method are surprisingly strong. For
example, when evaluating the explicit subframes over
all partial ASR results, an F-score of 0.75 is attained at
thresholds in the range 0.5-0.55. This F-score is sub-
stantially better than the F-score of our predictive NLU
in relation to the final full frames, which is 0.56 when
evaluated over all partial ASR results. This means that
our proposed model works better as an explicit incre-
mental NLU than mxNLU works as a predictive incre-
mental NLU. Further, we observe that this F-score of
0.75 against hand-annotated subframes is approximately
as good as the F-score of 0.76 that is achieved when
mxNLU is used to interpret complete utterances. We
therefore conclude that the proposed model is a promis-
ing and viable approach to explicit incremental NLU in
SASO-EN.
4 Discussion and Related Approaches
In this section, we discuss some of the practical aspects
of using the technique presented here, in relation to some
alternative approaches.
An important consideration for NLU techniques is the
cost, in both time and knowledge, of the annotation that
is needed. One attractive aspect of our technique is that
the only semantic annotation that is required is the asso-
ciation of complete user utterances with complete NLU
output frames. This task can be performed by anyone fa-
miliar with the scenario and the semantic frame format,
such as a system developer or scenario designer. In fact,
the annotation of the SASO-EN data set we use in this
paper has been described in (DeVault et al, 2010), which
reports that the overall corpus of 4678 token utterances
was semantically annotated at an average rate of about 10
seconds per unique utterance.
The model in Equation (2) is what (Heintze et al,
2010) call a hybrid output approach, in which larger and
larger frames are provided as partial input grows, but
in which a detailed alignment between surface text and
frames is not provided by the incremental NLU compo-
nent. They contrast hybrid output systems with tech-
niques that deliver either whole-frame output (like the
predictive mxNLU) or aligned output that connects indi-
vidual words to their meanings. A data-driven approach
to providing aligned outputs would involve preparing
a more detailed annotated corpus that aligns individ-
ual words and surface expressions to their corresponding
frame elements. Given such a word-aligned corpus, one
could train several kinds of models to produce the aligned
outputs incrementally. One strategy would be to use a se-
quential tagging model such as a CRF to tag partial utter-
ances with the frame elements that capture their explicit
meaning, as in (Heintze et al, 2010).
Using a machine learning approach that models a
more detailed alignment between surface text and frames
would be one way to more cleanly separate explicit from
predictive aspects of meaning. Preparing the training data
for such models, however, would create additional an-
notation costs. As part of creating the annotated sub-
frames for the evaluation presented in Section 3, we mea-
sured the time requirement for such annotation of word-
meaning alignments at about 30 seconds per unique ut-
terance. Performing full word-meaning alignment there-
fore takes about three times as much time as the com-
plete utterance annotation needed for our technique. Ad-

ditionally, this task requires a greater degree of linguis-
tic knowledge and sophistication, as the annotator must
be able to segment the utterance and align specific sur-
face segments with potentially complex aspects of mean-
ing such as modality, polarity, speech act types, and
others. An example of the kinds of complexities that
arise is illustrated in Figure 3, where the relationship be-
tween specific words like ?provide? and ?transportation?
to frame elements like <S>.sem.event move and
<S>.sem.theme clinic is not transparent, even if
it is straightforward to mark the whole utterance as con-
veying that meaning in this domain. We have generally
found this alignment task challenging for people without
advanced linguistics training.
The reason we describe the method in this paper as an
approximation of explicit NLU is that, partly because it
is trained without detailed word-meaning alignments, it
can be expected to occasionally include some predictive
aspects of user utterance meaning. An example of this is
the method?s explicit subframe output for the phrase we
need to in Figure 5.
Another way to approximate explicit NLU would be
using the method (Heintze et al, 2010) call an ensem-
ble of classifiers; it involves training an individual clas-
sifier for each frame key. Like the method presented
here, an ensemble of classifiers can be easily trained to
predict those frame elements that will appear in the fi-
nal frame Gu for each utterance. And like our method,
prediction with an ensemble of classifiers does not re-
quire detailed annotation of word-meaning alignment in
the training data. One difference is that, with our method,
by selecting an appropriate threshold, it is easy to enforce
certain consistency properties on subframe outputs. In an
ensemble of classifiers approach, there is no immediate
guarantee that the output frame constructed by the inde-
pendent classifiers will be internally consistent from the
standpoint of downstream system modules (Heintze et al,
2010). For example, in the SASO-EN domain, an NLU
frame should not contain frame elements that mix aspects
of events and states in the SASO-EN ontology; e.g., the
frame element <S>.sem.type event should not co-
occur in an NLU output frame with the frame element
<S>.sem.object-id market (which would be ap-
propriate for a state frame but not for an event frame).
With the method proposed here, if we select a threshold
? that is greater than 0.5, and if none of the complete
NLU frames contain incompatible key values (which is
relatively easy to enforce as part of the annotation task),
then it will be mathematically impossible for two incom-
patible frame elements to be returned in a subframe.3
Ultimately, a classification method that is trained on
word-meaning aligned data and that uses additional tech-
niques to ensure that only valid, grammatical output
frames are produced could prove to be an attractive ap-
proach. In future work, we will explore such techniques,
and compare both their performance as well as their anno-
tation and development costs to the approximation tech-
nique presented here.
5 Conclusion
The analysis in this paper has explored a method of ap-
proximating explicit incremental NLU using predictive
3Suppose frame element ei is incompatible with ej , and that
P (ei ? Gu|rj) > 0.5. By stipulation, no complete frame S ? S
such that ei ? S will also contain ej . Since we know that the total
probability of all the frames containing ei must be greater than 0.5 in
order for ei to be selected, we can infer that the total probability of all
frames including ej must be less than 0.5, and thus that ej will not be
selected.

techniques in finite semantic domains. We have shown
that an estimate of a user?s explicit utterance meaning
can be derived from an existing predictive understand-
ing model in an example domain. We have quantified
the performance of this new method in a corpus evalu-
ation, showing that the method returns incremental ex-
plicit subframes with performance ? as measured by pre-
cision, recall, and F-Score against hand-annotated sub-
frames ? that is competitive with a current statistical,
data-driven approach for understanding complete spoken
utterances in the same domain. We have provided ex-
amples that illustrate its strengths and weaknesses, and
discussed the annotation costs associated with imple-
menting this technique in relation to some alternative ap-
proaches. The method requires no additional annotation
beyond what is needed for training an NLU module to
understand complete spoken utterances. (Hand annota-
tion of word-meaning alignment for a small number of
utterances may be performed in order to tune the se-
lected threshold and evaluate explicit understanding per-
formance.) The method provides a free parameter that
can be used to target the most advantageous levels of pre-
cision and recall for a particular dialogue system applica-
tion. In future work, we will explore additional machine
learning models that leverage richer training data, and in-
vestigate further the combination of explicit and predic-
tive techniques.
