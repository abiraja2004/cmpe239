The relevance of context in disambiguat- 
ing natural anguage input has been widely 
acknowledged in the literature. However, 
most attempts at formalising the intuitive 
notion of context tend to treat the word and 
its context symmetrically. We demonstrate 
here that traditional measures such as mu- 
tual information score are likely to overlook 
a significant fraction of all co-occurrence 
phenomena in natural language. We also 
propose metrics for measuring directed lex- 
ical influence and compare performances. 
Keywords:  contextual post-processing,

tionality of context 
1 In t roduct ion  
It is widely accepted that context plays a significant 
role in shaping all aspects of language. Indeed, com- 
prehension would be utterly impossible without the 
extensive application of contextual information. Ev- 
idence from psycholinguistic and cognitive psycho- 
logical studies also demonstrates that contextual in- 
formation affects the activation levels of lexical can- 
didates during the process of perception (Weinreich, 
1980; McClelland, 1987). Garvin (1972) describes 
the role of context as follows: 
\[The meaning of\] a particular text \[is\] not 
the system-derived meaning as a whole, but 
that part of it which is included in the con- 
textually and situationally derived mean- 
ing proper to the text in question. (p. 69- 
70) 
In effect, this means that the context of a word serves 
to restrict its sense. 
The problem addressed in this research is that 
of improving the performance of a natural-language 
recogniser (such as a recognition system for hand- 
written or spoken language). The recogniser out- 
put typically consists of an ordered set of candidate 
words (word-choices) for each word position in the 
input stream. Since natural language abounds in 
contextual information, it is reasonable to utilise this 
in improving the performance of the recogniser (by 
disambiguating among the word-choices). 
The word-choices (together with their confidence 
values) constitute a confusion set. The recogniser 
may further associate a confidence-value with each of 
its word choices to communicate finer resolution in 
its output. The language module must update these 
confidence values to reflect contextual knowledge. 
2 L ingu is t i c  post -process ing  
The language module can, in principle, perform 
several types of "post-processing" on the word- 
candidate lists that the recogniser outputs for the 
different word-positions. The most promising possi- 
bilities are: 
? re-ranking the confusion set (and assigning new 
confidence-values to its entries), and, 
? deleting low-confidence entries from the confu- 
sion set (after applying contextual knowledge) 
Several researchers in NLP have acknowledged the 
relevance of context in disambiguating natural an- 
guage input ((Evett et al, 1991); (Zernik, 1991); 
(Hindle & Rooth, 1993); (Rosenfeld, 1994)). In fact, 
the recent revival of interest in statistical language 
processing is partly because of its (comparative) suc- 
cess in modelling context. However, a theoretically 
sound definition of context is needed to ensure that 
such re-ranking and deleting of word-choices helps 
and not hinders (Gale & Church, 1990). 
Researchers in information theory have come up 
with many inter-related formalisations ofthe ideas of 
context and contextual influence, such as mutual in- 
formation and joint entropy. However, to our knowl- 
edge, all attempts at arriving at a theoretical basis 
for formalising the intuitive notion of context have 
treated the word and its context symmetrically. 
Many researchers ((Smadja, 1991); (Srihari & Bal- 
tus, 1993)) have suggested that the information- 
theoretic notion of mutual information score (MIS) 
directly captures the idea of context. However, MIS 
332 
is deficient in its ability to detect one-sided correla- 
tions (cf. Table 1), and our research indicates that 
asymmetric nfluence measures are required to prop- 
erly handle them (Krip?sundar, 1994). 
For example, it seems quite unlikely that any 
symmetric information measure can accurately cap- 
ture the co-occurrence r lationship between the two 
words 'Paleolithic' and 'age' in the phrase 'Pale- 
olithic age'. The suggestion that 'age' exerts as much 
influence on 'Paleolithic' as vice versa seems ridicu- 
lous, to say the least. What is needed here is a di- 
rected (ie, one-sided)influence measure  (DIM), some- 
thing that serves as a measure of influence of one 
word on another, rather than as a simple, symmet- 
ric, "co-existence probability" of two words. Table 1 
illustrates how a DIM can be effective in detecting 
lexical and lexico-semantic associations. 
3 Compar ing  measures  o f  lex ica l  
in f luence  
We used a section of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) 
corpus containing 102K sentences (over two million 
words) as the training corpus for the partial results 
described here. The lexicon used was a simple 30K- 
word superset of the vocabulary of the training cor- 
pus. 
The results shown here serve to strengthen our 
hypothesis that non-standard information measures 
are needed for the proper utilisation of linguistic 
context. Table 1 shows some pairs of words that 
exhibit differing degrees of influence on each other. 
It also demonstrates very effectively that one-sided 
information measures are much better than sym- 
metric measures at utilising context properly. The 
arrow between each pair of words in the table in- 
dicates the direction of influence (or flow of infor- 
mation). The preponderance of word-pairs that ex- 
hibit only one direction of significant influence (eg, 
'according'---~'to') shows that no symmetric score 
could have captured the correlations in all of these 
phrases. 
Our formulation of directed influence is still evolv- 
ing. The word-pairs in Table 1 have been selected 
randomly from the test-set with the criterion that 
they scored "significantly" (ie, > 0.9) on at least 
one of the three measures D1, D2 and D3. The four 
measures (including MIS) are defined as follows: 
? , "  P(w,w2) MIS(wlw2) = log\[e(,$,)e(w2) j 
Dl(wl/w2) = P(w~) = #~2 
D2(wl/w2) = ste~l  ( w /w1~ ~ n l  
r" k~Cmax\ ]  "" 
D3(wl/w2) = ote,,O? ~--v-x_~--z~ ,, r~l ~''\ #Cmax\] . . . .  
In these definitions, #wlw2 denotes the frequency 
of co-occurrence of the words wl and w2,1 while 
1Note that the exact word order of wl and w2 is ir- 
relevant here. 
#Wl, and #w~ represent (respectively) the frequen- 
cies of their (unconditional) occurrence. 
#Cmax a~--! max(@wlw2) is defined to be the 
Wlt~2 
maximum co-occurrence frequency in the corpus, 
and appears to be a better normalisation factor than 
the size of the corpus itself. 
The definition of MIS implicitly incorporates the 
size of the corpus, since it has two P0  terms in the 
denominator, and only one in the numerator. The 
DIM's, on the other hand, have balanced fractions. 
Therefore, we have not included a log-term in the 
definitions of D1, D2, and D3 above. 
D1 is a straightforward estimation of the condi- 
tional probability of co-occurrence. It forms a base- 
line for performance valuations, but is prone to 
sparse data problems (Dunning, 1993). 
The s tep( )  functions in D2 and D3 represent two 
attempts at minimising such errors. These functions 
are piecewise-linear mappings of the normalised co- 
occurrence frequency, and are used as scaling factors. 
Their effect is apparent in Table 1, especially in the 
bottom third of the table, where the low frequency 
of the primer pushes D3 down to insignificant levels. 
The metrics D2 and D3 can and should be nor- 
mMised, perhaps to the 0-1 range, in order to fa- 
cilitate integration with other metrics such as the 
recogniser's confidence value. Similarly, the lack of 
normalisation of MIS hampers direct comparison of 
scores with the three DIM's. 
4 D iscuss ion  
Of the several different ypes of word-level associ- 
ations, lexical and lexico-semantic associations are 
among the most significant local associations. Lexi- 
cal (or associative) context is characterised by rigid 
word order, and usually implies that the primer and 
the primed together act as one lexical unit. Lexico- 
semantic associations are exemplified by phrasal verbs 
(eg, 'fix up'), and are characterised by morphological 
complexity in the verb part and spatial flexibility in 
the phrase as a whole. 
It is noteworthy that all the three DIM's capture 
the notions of lexical (ie, fixed) and lexico-semantic 
associations in one formula (albeit to differing de- 
grees of success). Thus we have 'staff' and 're- 
porter' influencing each other almost equally, while 
the asymmetric influence on 'in' from its right con- 
text ('addition') is also detected by the DIM's. 
It is our contention that symmetric measures 
constrain the re-ranking/proposing process signifi- 
cantly, since they are essentially blind to a signif- 
icant fraction (perhaps more than ha/f) of all co- 
occurrence phenomena in natural anguage.

Table 1: Asymmetry  in co-occurrence relationships: Word-pairs with "significant" influence in either 
direction have been selected randomly from the test-set. Note that very few of these pairs exhibit comparable 
influence on each other. The arrows indicate the direction of lexical influence (or information flow). A DIM 
score of 1 or more implies a significant association, whereas an MIS below 4 is considered a chance association. 
influence bear much promise. In fact, what we re- 
ally need is a generalised information score, a measure 
that takes into account several factors, such as: 
? directionality in correlation 
? multiple words participating in a lexical rela- 
tionship 
? different (morphological) forms of words, and, 
? spatial flexibility in the components of a collo- 
cation 
The generalised information score would capture all 
the variations that are introduced by the above fac- 
tors, and allow for the variants so as to reflect a 
"normalised" measure of contextual influence. 
We have also been working with experimental 
measures which attach higher significance to the 
collocation frequency, (measures which, in essence, 
"trust" the recogniser more often). Our future work 
will involve bringing these various factors together 
into one integrated formalism.
