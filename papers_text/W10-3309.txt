Abstract 
Opinion mining is a growing research 
area both at the natural language proc-
essing and the information retrieval 
communities.  Companies, politicians, 
as well as customers need powerful 
tools to track opinions, sentiments, 
judgments and beliefs that people may 
express in blogs, reviews, audios and 
videos data regarding a prod-
uct/service/person/organisation/etc. This 
work describes our contribution to fea-
ture based opinion mining where opin-
ions expressed towards each feature of 
an object or a product are extracted and 
summarized. The state of the art has 
shown that the hierarchical organization 
of features is a key step. In this context, 
our goal is to study the role of a domain 
ontology to structure and extract object 
features as well as to produce a compre-
hensive summary. This paper presents 
the developed system and the experi-
ments we carried out on a case study: 
French restaurant reviews. Our results 
show that our approach outperforms 
standard baselines. 
1 Introduction  
Opinion mining is a growing research area both 
in natural language processing and information 
retrieval communities. Companies, politicians, 
as well as customers need powerful tools to 
track opinions, sentiments, judgments and be-
liefs that people may express in blogs, reviews, 
audios and videos data regarding a prod-
uct/service/person/organisation/etc. The impor-
tance of emotion-oriented computing in the 
Web 2.0 has encouraged the creation of new 
search engines (like Tweetfeel 
(www.tweetfeel.com)) as well as the creation of 
a new research group within the W3C, namely 
the Emotion Markup Language, that aims to 
develop a representation language of the emo-
tional states of a user or the emotional states to 
be simulated by a user interface. In addition, 
most information retrieval evaluation campaigns 
(TREC, NTCI, etc.) have already integrated an 
opinion track.  
Computational approaches to sentiment analysis 
focus on extracting the affective content of a 
text from the detection of expressions of ?bag of 
sentiment words? at different levels of granular-
ity. These expressions are assigned a positive or 
a negative scalar value, representing a positive, 
a negative or neutral sentiment towards some 
topic. Roughly, research in this field can be 
grouped in four main categories (which are not 
exclusive):  
? Development of linguistic and cognitive 
models of opinion/sentiment where already 
existing psycholinguistic theories of emo-
tions are used to analyse how opinions are 
lexically expressed in texts (Wiebe et al 
2005; Read et al 2007; Asher et al 2009) 
? Elaboration of linguistic resources where 
corpus based and dictionary based ap-
proaches are used to automatically or semi-
automatically extract opinion bearing  
terms/expressions as well as their sentiment 
orientation (Strapparava et al, 2004; Turney 
and Littman, 2002) 
? Opinion extraction/analysis at the document 
(Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 2002), at the 
sentence or at the clause level (Kim et 
al., 2006; Choi et al, 2005) where local 
77
opinions are aggregated in order to compute 
the overall orientation of a docu-
ment/sentence/clause. 
? Feature based opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 
2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Carenini 
et al, 2005; Cheng and Xu, 2008) where 
opinions expressed towards the features of 
an object or a product are exacted and 
summarized. 
The work described in this paper feats into the 
last category. The aim is not to compute the 
general orientation of a document or a sentence, 
since a positive sentiment towards an object 
does not imply a positive sentiment towards all 
the aspects of this object, as in: I like this res-
taurant even if the service is slow. In feature 
based opinion mining, a holder (the person who 
posts the review) expresses a positive/negative 
or neutral opinions towards a main topic (the 
object or the product on which the holder ex-
presses his opinions) and its associated features. 
As defined in (Hu and Liu, 2004), a feature can 
be a ?part-of? of a topic (such as the screen of a 
camera) or a property of the ?part-of? of the 
topic (such as the size of the screen).  The ex-
pressed opinion can be explicit, as in ?the 
screen of this camera is great?, or implicit, as in 
?the camera is heavy?, that expresses a negative 
opinion towards the weight of the camera. Same 
features can also be expressed differently, for 
example, ?drink? and ?beverage? refer to the 
same restaurant feature. 
Having, for an object/product, the set of its as-
sociated features F={f1,?fn}, research in fea-
ture based opinion mining mostly focus on 
extracting the set F from reviews, and then, for 
each feature fi of F, extract the set of its associ-
ated opinion expressions OE={OE1,?OEj}. 
Once the set of couples (fi, OE) were extracted, 
a summary of the review is generally produced. 
During this process, the key questions are: how 
the set F of features can be obtained? How they 
are linguistically expressed? How they are re-
lated to each other ? Which knowledge repre-
sentation model can be used to better organize 
product features and to produce a comprehen-
sive summary?  
To answer these questions, we propose in this 
paper to study the role of an ontology in feature 
based opinion mining. More precisely, our aim 
is to study how a domain ontology can be used 
to: 
? structure features: we show that an ontol-
ogy is more suitable than a simple hierarchy 
where features are grouped using only the 
?is-a? relation (Carenini et al, 2005; Blair-
Goldensohn et al, 2008) 
? extract explicit and implicit features from 
texts: we show how the lexical component 
as well as the set of properties of the ontol-
ogy can help to extract, for each feature, the 
set of the associated opinion expressions.  
? produce a discourse based summary of the 
review: we show how the ontology can 
guide the process of identifying the most 
relevant discourse relations that may hold 
between elementary discourse  units.  
The paper is organised as follows. We give in 
section 2, a state of the art of the main ap-
proaches used in the field as well as the motiva-
tions of our work. We present in the next sec-
tion, our approach. Finally, in section 4, we de-
scribe the experiments we carried out on a case 
study: French restaurant reviews 
  
2 Feature based Opinion mining 
2.1 Related Works 
Overall, two main families of work stand out: 
those that extract a simple list of features and 
those that organize them into a hierarchy using 
taxonomies or ontologys. The feature extraction 
process mainly concerns explicit features. 
 
Works without knowledge representation 
models : The pioneer work in feature based 
opinion mining is probably the one of Hu and 
Liu (2004) that applies association rule mining 
algorithm to discover product features (nouns 
and noun-phrases). Heuristics (frequency of 
occurrence, proximity with opinion words, 
etc...) can eliminate irrelevant candidates. Opin-
ion expressions (only adjective phrases) which 
are the closest to these features are extracted. A 
summary is then produced and displays, for 
each feature, both positive and negative phrases 
and the total number of these two categories. 
To improve the feature extraction phase, Pope-
scu and Etzioni (2005) suggest in their system 
78
OPINE, to extract only nominal groups whose 
frequency is above a threshold determined ex-
perimentally using the calculation of PMI 
(Point-wise Mutual Information) between each 
of these nouns and meronymy expressions asso-
ciated with the product. No summary is pro-
duced.  
The main limitation of these approaches is that 
there are a great many extracted features and 
there is a lack of organization. Thus, similar 
features are not grouped together (for example, 
in restaurant domain, ?atmosphere? and ?ambi-
ence?), and possible relationships between fea-
tures of an object are not recognized (for exam-
ple, ?coffee? is a specific term for ?drink?). In 
addition, polarity analysis (positive, negative or 
neutral) of the document is done by assigning 
the dominant polarity of opinion words it con-
tains (usually adjectives), regardless of polari-
ties individually associated to each feature. 
 
Works using feature taxonomies. Following 
works have a different approach: they do not 
look for a ?basic list? of features but rather a list 
hierarchically organized through the use of tax-
onomies. We recall that a taxonomy is a list of 
terms organized hierarchically through speciali-
zation relationship type ?is a sort of?.  
Carenini et al (2005) use predefined taxono-
mies and semantic similarity measures to auto-
matically extract classic features of a product 
and calculate how close to predefined concepts 
in the taxonomy they are. This is reviewed by 
the user in order to insert missing concepts in 
the right place while avoiding duplication. The 
steps of identifying opinions and their polarity 
and the production of a summary are not de-
tailed. This method was evaluated on the prod-
uct review corpus of Hu and Liu (2004) and 
resulted in a significant reduction in the number 
of extracted features. However, this method is 
very dependent on the effectiveness of similar-
ity measures used.  
In their system PULSE, Gamon et al (2005) 
analyze a large amount of text contained in a 
database. A taxonomy, including brands and 
models of cars, is automatically extracted from 
the database. Coupled with a classification 
technique, sentences corresponding to each leaf 
of the taxonomy are extracted. At the end of the 
process, a summary which can be more or less 
detailed is produced. 
The system described in (Blair-Goldensohn et 
al., 2008) extracts information about services, 
aggregates the sentiments expressed on every 
aspect and produces a summary. The automatic 
feature extraction combines a dynamic method, 
where the different aspects of services are the 
most common nouns, and a static method, 
where a taxonomy grouping the concepts con-
sidered to be the most relevant by the user is 
used to manually annotate sentences. The re-
sults also showed that the use of a hierarchy 
significantly improves the quality of extracted 
features. 
 
Works using ontologys. These works aim at 
organizing features using a more elaborated 
model of representation: an ontology Unlike 
taxonomy, ontology is not restricted to a hierar-
chical relationship between concepts, but can 
describe other types of paradigmatic relations 
such as synonymy, or more complex relation-
ships such as composition relationship or space 
relationship.  
Overall, extracted features correspond exclu-
sively to terms contained in the ontology. The 
feature extraction phase is guided by a domain 
ontology, built manually (Zhao and Li, 2009), 
or semi-automatically (Feiguina, 2006; Cheng 
and Xu, 2008), which is then enriched by an 
automatic process of extraction / clustering of 
terms which corresponds to new feature identi-
fication.  
To extract terms, Feiguina (2006) uses pattern 
extraction coupled to a terminology extractor 
trained over a set of features related to a product 
and identified manually in a few reviews. Same 
features are grouped together using semantic 
similarity measures. The system OMINE 
(Cheng and Xu, 2008) proposes a mechanism 
for ontology enrichment using a domain glos-
sary which includes specific terms such as 
words of jargon, abbreviations and acronyms. 
Zhao and Li (2009) add to their ontology con-
cepts using a corpus based method: sentences 
containing a combination of conjunction word 
and already recognized concept are extracted. 
This process is repeated iteratively until no new 
concepts are found. 
Ontologys have also been used to support polar-
ity mining. For example, (Chaovalit and Zhou, 
2008) manually built an ontology for movie re-
views and incorporated it into the polarity clas-
79
sification task which significantly improve per-
formance over standard baseline. 
 
2.2 Towards an ontology based opinion 
mining 
Most of the researchers actually argue that 
the use of a hierarchy of features improves the 
performance of feature based opinion mining 
systems.  However, works that actually use a 
domain ontology (cf. last section) exploit the 
ontology as a taxonomy using only the is-a rela-
tion between concepts. They do not really use 
all data stored in an ontology, such as the lexical 
components and other types of relations. In ad-
dition, in our knowledge, no work has investi-
gated the use of an ontology to produce com-
prehensive summaries. 
 We think there is still room for improvement 
in the field of feature based sentiment analysis. 
To get an accurate appraisal of opinion in texts, 
it is important for NLP systems to go beyond 
explicit features and to propose a fine-grained 
analysis of opinions expressed towards each 
feature. Our intuition is that the full use of on-
tology would have several advantages in the 
domain of opinion mining to:  
Structure features: ontologys are tools that 
provide a lot of semantic information. They help 
to define concepts, relationships and entities 
that describe a domain with unlimited number 
of terms. This set of terms can be a significant 
and valuable lexical resource for extracting ex-
plicit and implicit features. For example, in the 
following restaurant review: cold and not tasty 
the negative opinion not tasty is ambiguous 
since it is not associated to any lexicalised fea-
ture. However, if the term cold is stored in the 
ontology as a lexical realization of the concept 
quality of the cuisine, the opinion not tasty can 
be easily associated to the feature cuisine of the 
restaurant (note that the conjunction and plays 
an important role in the desambiguisation proc-
ess). We discuss this point at the last section of 
the paper.   
 
Extract features: ontologys provide structure 
for these features through their concept hierar-
chy but also their ability to define many rela-
tions linking these concepts. This is also a valu-
able resource for structuring the knowledge ob-
tained during feature extraction task. In addi-
tion, the relations between concepts and lexical 
information can be used to extract implicit fea-
tures. For example, if the concept customer is 
linked to the concept restaurant by the relation 
to eat in,  a positive opinion towards the restau-
rant can be extracted from the review: we eat 
well. Similarly, if the concept restaurant is 
linked to the concept landscape with the rela-
tion to view, a positive opinion can be extracted 
towards the look out of the restaurant from the 
following review:  very good restaurant where 
you can savour excellent Gratin Dauphinois 
and admire the most beautiful peak of the Pyr?-
n?es 
 
Produce summaries. Finally, we also believe 
that ontologys can play a fundamental role to 
produce well organised summary and discursive 
representation of the review. We further detail 
this point at the last section of the paper. 
3 Our approach 
Our feature based opinion mining system needs 
three basic components: a lexical resource L of 
opinion expressions, a lexical ontology O where 
each concept and each property is associated to 
a set of labels that correspond to their linguistic 
realizations and a review R.   
Following the idea described in (Asher et al 
2009), a review R is composed of a set of ele-
mentary discourse units (EDU). Using the dis-
course theory SDRT (Asher and Lascarides 
2003) as our formal framework, an EDU is a 
clause containing at least one elementary opin-
ion unit (EOU) or a sequence of clauses that 
together bear a rhetorical relation to a segment 
expressing an opinion. An EOU is an explicit 
opinion expression composed of a noun, an ad-
jective or a verb with its possible modifiers (ac-
tually negation and adverb) as described in our 
lexicon L. 
We have segmented conjoined NPs or APs 
into separate clauses?for instance, the film is 
beautiful and powerful is taken to express two 
segments: the film is beautiful and the film is 
powerful. Segments are then connected to each 
other using a small subset of ?veridical? dis-
course relations, namely: 
? Contrast (a,b), implies that a and b are both 
true but there is some defeasible implication 
80
of one that is contradicted by the other. Pos-
sible markers can be although, but. 
? Result(a,b) indicated by markers like so, as 
a result, indicates that the EDU b  is a con-
sequence or result of the EDU a.  
? Continuation(a,b ) corresponds to a series 
of speeches in which there are no time con-
straints and where segments form part of a 
larger thematic. For example, "The average 
life expectancy in France is 81 years. In 
Andorra, it reaches over 83 years. In Swazi-
land it does not exceed 85 years." 
? Elaboration(a,b) describes global informa-
tion that was stated previously with more 
specific information. For example, "Yester-
day, I spent a wonderful day. I lounged in 
the sun all morning. I ate in a nice little res-
taurant. Then at night,  I met my friend Emi-
ly." 
 
 In a review R, an opinion holder h comments 
on a subset S of the features of an ob-
ject/product using some opinion expressions. 
Each feature corresponds to the set of linguistic 
realizations of a concept or a property of the 
domain ontology O. For example, in the follow-
ing product review, EDUs are between square 
brackets, EOUs are between embraces whereas 
object features are underlined. There is a 
contrast relation between the EDUb and EDUc 
which makes up the opinion expressed within 
the EDUd. 
[I bought the product yesterday]
 a. [Even if the 
product is {excellent}]b, [the design and the size 
are  {very basic}]
 c, [which is {disappointing}  
in this brand]
 c.  
 
The figure below gives an overview of our sys-
tem. First, each review R is parsed using the 
French syntactic parser Cordial 1 , which pro-
vides, for each sentence, its POS tagging and 
the set of dependency relations. The review is 
then segmented in EDUs using the discourse 
parser described in (Afantenos and al, 2010).  
 
For each EDU, the system : 
1. Extracts EOUs using a rule based approach  
2. Extracts features that correspond to the 
process of term extraction using the domain 
ontology

3. Associates, for each feature within an EDU, 
the set of opinion expressions 
4. Produces a discourse based summary. 
 
Since the summarization module is not done 
yet, we detail below the three first steps.  
 
3.1 Extracting Elementary Opinion Units 
We recall that an EOU is the smallest opinion 
unit within an EDU. It is composed of one and 
only one opinion word (a noun, an adjective or a 
verb) possibly associated with some modifiers 
like negation words and adverbs. For example, 
?really not good? is an EOU.  An EOU can also 
be simply an adverb as in too spicy. Adverbs are 
also used to update our opinion lexicon, as in 
too chic where the opinion word chic is added.  
Finally, we also extract expressions of recom-
mendation, such as : go to this restaurant, you 
will not regret it, which are very frequent in 
reviews. 
3.2 Extracting features  
This step aims at extracting for the review all 
the labels of the ontology. Since each concept 
and its associated lexical realizations corre-
spond to explicit features, we simply project the 
lexical component of the ontology in the review 
in order to get, for each EDU, the set of features 
F. Of course, since our lexical ontology does not 
81
cover all the linguistic realizations of concepts 
and properties in a given domain, many terms in 
the review can be missed. We show, in the next 
section, that linking features to opinion expres-
sions can partially solve this problem. 
To extract implicit features, ontology proper-
ties are used. We recall that these properties 
define relations between concepts of the ontol-
ogy. For example, the property ?look at? links 
?customer? and ?design? concepts.  
3.3 Associating opinions expressions to 
extracted features  
In this step, the extracted opinion expressions in 
step 1 have to be linked to the features extracted 
in step 2 i.e. we have to associate to each EDUi 
the set of couples (fi, OEi). During this step, we 
distinguish the following cases : 
 
Case 1. Known features and known opinion 
words. For example, if the lexicon contains the 
words really, good and excellent and the ontol-
ogy contains the terms eating place and food  as 
a linguistic realization of the concepts restau-
rant and food, then this step allows the extrac-
tion from the EDU ?really good restaurant with 
excellent food?? the couples (restaurant, really 
good) and (food, excellent). This example is 
quite simple but in many cases, features and 
opinion words are not close to each other which 
make the link difficult to find. Actually, our 
system deals with conjunctions (including co-
mas) as in: ?I recommend pizzas and ice 
creams?, ?very good restaurant but very expen-
sive?  
 
Case 2. Known features and unknown opinion 
expressions, as in the EDU ?acceptable prices? 
where the opinion word acceptable has not been 
extracted in step 1 (cf. section 3.1). In this case, 
the opinion lexicon can be automatically up-
dated with the retrieved opinion word. 
 
Case 3. Unknown features and known opinion 
expressions, as in the EDU ?old fashion restau-
rant? where the features fashion has not been 
extracted in step 2 (cf. section 3.2). In this case, 
the domain ontology can be updated by adding a 
new label to an existing concept or property or 
by adding a new concept or a new property in 
the right place to the ontology. However, since a 
user may express an opinion on different objects 
within a review, this step has to be done care-
fully. To avoid errors, we propose to manually 
update the ontology.  
 
Case 4. Opinion expressions alone, as in the 
EDU ?It?s slow, cold and not good?. This kind 
of EDU expresses an implicit feature. In this 
case, we use the ontology properties in order to 
retrieve the associated concept in the ontology. 
For example, in the sentence ?we eat very well?, 
the property ?eat? of the ontology which links 
?customer? and ?food? will allow the system to 
determine that ?very well? refers to ?food?. 
 
Case 5. Features alone, as in the EDU: ?Nice 
surrounding on sunny days with terrace?, even 
if the feature ?terrace? is not associated to any 
opinion word, it is important to extract this in-
formation because it gives a positive opinion 
towards the restaurant. An EDU with features 
alone can also be an indicator of the presence of 
an implicit opinion expression towards the fea-
ture as in this restaurant is a nest of tourists 
 
Actually, our system deals with all these cases 
except the last one.  
4 Case study : mining restaurant re-
views 
In this section, we present the experiments we 
carried out on a case study: French restaurant 
reviews.  
4.1 Corpus 
For our experiments, we use a corpus of 58 
restaurant reviews (40 positive reviews and 18 
negatives reviews, for a total of 4000 words) 
extracted from the web site Qype2. Each review 
contains around 70 words and is composed of 
free comments on restaurants (but also on other 
objects like pubs, cinemas, etc.) with a lot of 
typos and syntactic errors. Each review appears 
in the web site with additional information such 
as the date of the review, the user name of the 
holder and a global rate from 1 (bad review) to 
5 (very good review). In this experiment, we 
only use the textual comments posted. Figure 2 
shows an example of a review form our corpus.

4.2 Ontology 
Since our aim is to study the role of a domain 
ontology to feature based opinion mining, we 
choose to reuse an existing ontology. However, 
for the restaurant domain, we do not find any 
public available ontology for French. We thus 
use a pre-existent ontology 3  for English as a 
basis coupled with additional information that 
we gather from several web sites 4 . We first 
translate the existing ontology to French and 
then adapt it to our application by manually re-
organize, add and delete concepts in order to 
describe important restaurant features. Dispari-
ties between our ontology and the one we found 
in the web mainly come from cultural consid-
erations. For example, we do not found in the 
English ontology concepts like terrace. 
Our domain ontology has been implemented 
under Prot?g?5 and actually contains 239 con-
cepts (from which we have 14 concepts directly 
related to the superclass owl:think), 36 object 
properties and 703 labels (646 labels for con-
cepts and 57 labels for properties). The left part 
of figure 3 shows an extract of our restaurant 
domain ontology.  
4.3 Opinion Lexicon 
Our lexicon contains a list of opinion terms 
where each lexical entry is of the form:  
[POS, opinion category, polarity, strength] 
where POS is the part of speech tagging of the 
term, opinion category can be a judgment, a 
sentiment or an advice (see (Asher et al 2009) 
for a detailed description of these categories), 
polarity and strength corresponds respectively 
to the opinion orientation (positive, negative 
and neutral) and the opinion strength (a score 
between 0 and 2). For example, we have the 
following entry for the term good: [Adj, judg-
ment, +, 1].

 The lexicon actually contains 222 adjectives, 
152 nouns, 157 verbs. It is automatically built 
following the algorithm described in (Chardon, 
2010). We then add manually to this lexicon 98 
adverbs and 15 expressions of negation.

4.4 Experiments 
We conduct three types of experiment: the 
evaluation of the extraction of elementary opin-
ion units (cf. section 3.1), the evaluation of the 
features extraction step (cf. section 3.2) and fi-
nally, the evaluation of the link between the re-
trieved opinion expressions and the retrieved 
object features (cf. section 3.3).  
These experiments are carried out using   
GATE 6  toolkit.  To evaluate our system, we 
create a gold standard by manually annotate in 
the corpus implicit and explicit elementary 
opinion units, implicit and explicit object fea-
tures as well as for each opinion expression its 
associated feature.  
 
Evaluation of the EOU extraction step. 
The table below shows our results. Our system 
misses some EOU for two main reasons. The 
first one is due to missed opinion words in the 
lexicon and to implicit opinion expressions, 
such as breathtaking, since our extraction rules 
do not manage these cases (note that implicit 
opinion detection is still an open research prob-
lem in opinion mining).

83
The second reason is the errors that come from 
the syntactic parser mainly because of typos and 
dependency link errors. Concerning precision, 
false positives are mainly due to some opinion 
words that are in our lexicon but they do not 
express opinions in the restaurant domain. In 
addition, some of our extraction rules, espe-
cially those that extract expression of recom-
mendations, do not perform very well which 
imply a loss of precision.

Since the corpus is in the restaurant domain, the 
precision of this task is very good because most 
of the extracted features are relevant. However, 
recall is not as good as precision because the set 
of ontology labels do not totally cover the terms 
of the corpus. Another limitation of our system 
is that we do not take into account the cases 
where a term can be a linguistic realization of 
many concepts (ex. caf? can be a drink or a 
place to drink).  
Figure 4 shows an example of the result we ob-
tain for this step.

Evaluation of the link between EOU and fea-
tures. 
The figure below shows our result on a sample. 
In this example, the system is able to extract 
opinion expressions which do not contain words 
present in the lexicon. It is the case with ?sympa 
(nice)? which has been correctly associated to 
?resto (restaurant)? and ?deco (interior de-
sign)? even if the word nice was not in the lexi-
con.  
In order to evaluate the added value of using an 
ontology to feature based opinion mining, we 
compare our system to the well known ap-
proaches of Hu and Liu and Popescu and Etzi-
oni (cf. section 2.1) that do not use any knowl-
edge representation. We have also compared 
our approach to those that use taxonomies of 
concepts by deleting the properties of our do-
main ontology. The results are shown in table 2.

Table 2. Evaluation of our system and its 
comparison to existing approaches 
 
In the Hu and Liu approach, features are nomi-
nal groups. We first extract all frequent features 
from our corpus that appear in more than 1% of 
the sentences. Then we extract EOU from those 
sentences (note that contrary to Hu and Liu, we 
do not extract only adjectives, but also nouns, 
verbs and adverbs). Non frequent features are 
finally removed as described in (Hu and Liu, 
2004). In order to improve the extraction of 
relevant features, we extract features that have a 
good point mutual information value with the 
word restaurant, as described in (Popescu and 
Etzioni, 2005). The precision of our system is 
better compared to the approach of Hu and Liu 
that extracts too many irrelevant features (such 
as any doubt, whole word). Our system is also 
better compared to the PMI approach even if it 
performs better than Hu and Liu?s approach. 
Recall is also better because our system can ex-
tract implicit features such as well eating,  lot of 
noise,  thanks to the use of ontology properties.   
Finally, when using only taxonomy of concepts 
instead of the ontology, we observe that the F-
measure is slightly better because actually fea-
84
tures related to object properties represent only 
1,6% of feature cases in our corpus. Using, the 
ontology, our approach is able to extract from 
sentences like "we eat good and healthy" the 
couples (eat, good) and (eat, healthy) and then 
to link the opinion expressions to the concept 
dish whereas when using only the taxonomy, 
these opinion expressions are related to any fea-
ture. 
5 Conclusion and prospects 
5.1 Contribution of our system 
Our method is promising because the use of the 
ontology allows to improve the feature extrac-
tion and the association between an opinion ex-
pressions and object features. On the one hand, 
the ontology is useful thanks to its concept list 
which brings a lot of semantic data in the sys-
tem. Using concept labels the ontology allows 
to recognize terms which refer to the same con-
cepts and brings some hierarchy between these 
concepts. On the other hand, the ontology is 
useful thanks to its list of properties between 
concepts which allows recognizing some opin-
ions expressed about implicit features.  
 
5.2 Prospects 
Opinion lexicon improvement.  
The opinion extraction we achieved is naive 
because we use a simple opinion word lexicon 
which is not perfectly adapted to the domain. To 
improve this part of the treatment, it would be 
interesting to use opinion ontology. As illus-
trated in section 2.2, constructing a domain on-
tology for the purpose of opinion mining poses 
several interesting questions in term of knowl-
edge representation, such as: what are the fron-
tiers between knowledge, where concepts are 
domain dependent, and opinion, where expres-
sions can be at the same time dependent (the 
term long can be positive for a battery life but 
negative if it refers to a the service of a restau-
rant) and independent (the term good is posi-
tive) from a domain. Our intuition is that the 
two levels have to be separated as possible.  
 
Natural Language processing (NLP) rules 
improvement.  
Our system is limited by some current NLP 
problems. For example, the system does not 
treat the anaphora. For example, in the sentence 
?Pizzas are great. They are tasty, original and 
generous?, it does not recognize that the three 
last adjectives refer to ?pizzas?.  There is also 
the problem of conditional proposition. For ex-
ample, in the sentence ?affordable prices if you 
have a fat wallet?, the system is not able to de-
termine that ?affordable prices? is subject to a 
condition. 
  
Ontology and lexicon enrichment. 
 Thanks to the ability to link opinion expression 
and ontological term extractions, our system is 
able to extract some missing opinion words and 
labels of the ontology. We think it could be in-
teresting to implement a module which allows 
the user to easily enrich opinion word lexicon 
and ontology. Furthermore, it will be interesting 
to evaluate the benefit of this method in both 
opinion mining and ontological domains.   
 
Towards a discourse based summary.  
The last step of the system is to produce a sum-
mary of the review that presents to the user all 
the opinion expressions associated to the main 
topic and all its features. This summary does not 
pretend to aggregate opinions for each feature 
or for the global topic. Instead, the aim is to or-
ganize the opinions of several reviews about 
one restaurant in order to allow the user to 
choose what feature is important or not for him. 
In addition to this kind of summarization, we 
want to investigate how the domain ontology 
can be used to guide the process of identifying 
the most relevant discourse relations between 
elementary discourse units (EDU).  Actually, 
the automatic identification of discourse rela-
tions that hold between EDUs is still an open 
research problem. Our idea is that there is con-
tinuation relation between EDU that contain 
terms that refer to concepts which are at the 
same level of the ontology hierarchy, and there 
is an elaboration relation when EDU contains 
more specific concepts than those of the previ-
ous clause.
