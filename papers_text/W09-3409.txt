Abstract
We present for the first time a compu-
tational model for the reduplication of
the Vietnamese language. Reduplication
is a popular phenomenon of Vietnamese
in which reduplicative words are created
by the combination of multiple syllables
whose phonics are similar. We first give
a systematical study of Vietnamese redu-
plicative words, bringing into focus clear
principles for the formation of a large class
of bi-syllabic reduplicative words. We then
make use of optimal finite-state devices,
in particular minimal sequential string-to
string transducers to build a computational
model for very efficient recognition and
production of those words. Finally, sev-
eral nice applications of this computa-
tional model are discussed.
1 Introduction
Finite-state technology has been applied success-
fully for describing the morphological processes
of many natural languages since the pioneer-
ing works of (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Kosken-
niemi, 1983). It is shown that while finite-state
approaches to most natural languages have gen-
erally been very successful, they are less suitable
for non-concatenative phenomena found in some
languages, for example the non-concatenative
word formation processes in Semitic languages
(Cohen-Sygal and Wintner, 2006). A popular non-
concatenative process is reduplication ? the pro-
cess in which a morpheme or part of it is dupli-
cated.
Reduplication is a common linguistic phe-
nomenon in many Asian languages, for exam-
ple Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Thai,
Malay, Indonesian, Chamorro, Hebrew, Bangla,
and especially Vietnamese.
We are concerned with the reduplication of
Vietnamese. It is noted that Vietnamese is a mono-
syllabic language and its word forms never change,
contrary to occidental languages that make use of
morphological variations. Consequently, redupli-
cation is one popular and important word forma-
tion method which is extensively used to enrich the
lexicon. This follows that the Vietnamese lexicon
consists of a large number of reduplicative words.
This paper presents for the first time a compu-
tational model for recognition and production of a
large class of Vietnamese reduplicative words. We
show that Vietnamese reduplication can be sim-
ulated efficiently by finite-state devices. We first
introduce the Vietnamese lexicon and the struc-
ture of Vietnamese syllables. We next give a com-
plete study about the reduplication phenomenon
of Vietnamese language, bringing into focus for-
mation principles of reduplicative words. We then
propose optimal finite-state sequential transducers
recognizing and producing a substantial class of
these words. Finally, we present several nice ap-
plications of this computational model before con-
cluding and discussing the future work.
2 Vietnamese Lexicon
In this section, we first present some general char-
acteristics of the Vietnamese language. We then
give some statistics of the Vietnamese lexicon and
introduce the structure of Vietnamese syllables.
The following basic characteristics of Viet-
namese are adopted from (?o?n, 2003; ?o?n et
al. , 2003; H?u et al , 1998; Nguy?n et al , 2006).
2.1 Language Type
Vietnamese is classified in the Viet-Muong group
of the Mon-Khmer branch, that belongs to the
Austro-Asiatic language family. Vietnamese is
also known to have a similarity with languages
in the Tai family. The Vietnamese vocabulary fea-
tures a large amount of Sino-Vietnamese words.
63
Moreover, by being in contact with the French lan-
guage, Vietnamese was enriched not only in vo-
cabulary but also in syntax by the calque of French
grammar.
Vietnamese is an isolating language, which is
characterized by the following properties:
? it is a monosyllabic language;
? its word forms never change, contrary to oc-
cidental languages that make use of morpho-
logical variations (plural form, conjugation,
etc.);
? hence, all grammatical relations are mani-
fested by word order and function words.
2.2 Vocabulary
Vietnamese has a special unit called ?ti?ng? that
corresponds at the same time to a syllable with re-
spect to phonology, a morpheme with respect to
morpho-syntax, and a word with respect to sen-
tence constituent creation. For convenience, we
call these ?ti?ng? syllables. The Vietnamese vo-
cabulary contains
? simple words, which are monosyllabic;
? reduplicative words composed by phonetic
reduplication;
? compound words composed by semantic co-
ordination and by semantic subodination;
? complex words phonetically transcribed from
foreign languages.
The Vietnamese lexicon edited recently by the
Vietnam Lexicography Center (Vietlex1) contains
40, 181 words and idioms, which are widely used
in contemporary spoken language, newspapers
and literature. These words are made up of 7, 729
syllables. Table 1 shows some interesting statistics
of the word length measured in syllables. 6, 303
syllables (about 81.55% of syllables) are words by
themselves. Two-syllable words are the most fre-
quent, consisting of nearly 71% of the vocabulary.
2.3 Syllables
In this paragraph, we introduce phonetic attributes
of Vietnamese syllables. In addition of the mono-
syllabic characteristic, Vietnamese is a tonal lan-
guage in that each syllable has a certain pitch char-
acteristic. The meaning of a syllable varies with its

tone. This phonetic mechanism can also be found
in other languages such that Chinese or Thai.
There are six tones in Vietnamese as specified
in Table 2. The letter a denotes any non-accent syl-
lable. These six tones can be roughly classified
into two groups corresponding to low and high
pitches in pronunciation. The first half of the ta-
ble contains three low tones and the second half
contains three high tones. In addition, the differ-
ence in the tone of two syllables are distinguished
by flat property of tones. The 1st and 4th tones in
Table 2 are flat (b?ng), the other tones are non-flat
(tr?c).
The structure of a Vietnamese syllable is given
in Table 3. Each syllable can be divided into three
parts: onset, rhyme and tone. The onset is usually
a consonant, however it may be empty. The rhyme
contains a vowel (nucleus) with or without glide
/w/, and an optional consonant (coda). It is no-
ticed that the initial consonant of a syllable does
not carry information of the tone, the Vietnamese
tone has an effect only on the rhyme part of the
syllable (Tran et al, 2006). This result reinforces
the fact that a tone is always marked by the nucleus
composant of the rhyme which is a vowel. Readers
who are interested in detail the phonetic composi-
tion of Vietnamese syllables may refer to (Tran et
al., 2006; Vu et al, 2005).

Table 3: Phonetic structure of Vietnamese sylla-

tive word is characterized by a phenomenon called
phonetic interchange, in which one or several pho-
netic elements of a syllable are repeated following
a certain number of specific rules.
From the point of view of sense, the redupli-
cation in Vietnamese usually indicates a diminu-
tive of adjectives, which can also be found in He-
brew, or a pluralization in Malay, in Thai and in
Indonesian, or an intensivity as the use of par-
tial reduplication in Japanese, Thai, Cantonese and
Chamorro (an Austronesian language spoken on
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands). In this
aspect, Vietnamese reduplication serves similar
functions as those of reduplication in several Asian
languages, as reported in an investigation of Asian
language reduplication within the NEDO project
(Tokunaga et al , 2008a; Tokunaga et al , 2008b).
The Vietnamese reduplication creates an ex-
pressional sense connecting closely to the pho-
netic material of Vietnamese, a language of rich
melody. Consequently, there are many Vietnamese
reduplicative words which are difficult to inter-
pret to foreigners, though in general, native Viet-
namese speakers always use and understand them
correctly (Di?p, 1999).
Vietnamese reduplicative words can be classi-
fied into three classes basing on the number of
syllables they contain: two-syllable (or bi-syllabic)
reduplicative words, three-syllable (or tri-syllabic)
reduplicative words and four-syllable reduplicative
words. The bi-syllabic class is the most important
class because of two reasons: (1) bi-syllabic redu-
plicative words make up more than 98% amount of
reduplicative words, that is, almost reduplicative
words has two syllables; and (2) bi-syllabic redu-
plicative words embody principle characteristics
of the reduplication phenomenon in both phone as-
pect and sense formation aspect. For these reasons,
in this paper, we address only bi-syllabic redu-
plicative words and call them reduplicative words
for short, if there is no confusion.
As presented in the previous section, a syllable
has a strict structure containing three parts: the on-
set, the rhyme and the tone. Basing on the phonetic
interchange of a syllable, we distinguish two types
of reduplication:
? full reduplication, where the whole syllable is
repeated;
? partial reduplication, where either the onset
is repeated or the rhyme and the tone are re-
peated.
In this work, we constraint ourselves by focus-
ing only on the construction of an efficient com-
putational model applied for reduplicative words
which have clear and well-defined formation prin-
ciples. These words can be classified into three
types investigated in detail in the following sub-
sections. In given examples, the base syllables (or
root syllable, or root for short) are the ones which
are underlined. The reduplication that has unde-
fined or incomplete formation rules will be tackled
in future works.
3.1 Full Reduplication
In this type of reduplication, the root is identically
repeated; there is only a slight difference on stress
in pronunciation. For example, hao hao (a little
similar), l?m l?m (intentional), ??ng ??ng (acci-
dentally dertermined), l? l? (silently). In the Viet-
namese lexicon there are 274 reduplicative words
of this type.
In principle, there appears to be many redu-
plicative words of this type whose their roots may
be whatever syllables bearing whatever tone, for
instance ?? ??, h? h?, s?ng s?ng, ch?m ch?m.
However, in consequence of the difference of
stress between the root and the reduplicant, the
tone of the reduplicant is changed in order to be
in harmony with the root, for the sake of more
readability and audibility (?easier to read, easier
to hear?). This consequence leads to the formation
of reduplicative words of the second type which
we call reduplication with tone according.
3.2 Reduplication with Tone According
As presented above, the difference between tone of
the root and the reduplicant is a consequence of the
difference between their stress which is expressed
by their tones. This creates reduplicative words of
the second type; for example, ?o ?? (reddish), h?
h? (in the bloom of youth), s?ng s?ng (statly, high
and majestic), ch?m ch?m (rather slow). The tone
properties (low or high pitch, flat or non-flat) are
now put into use.

Table 4: Statistic of the second type reduplication
The prosodic influence is responsible for the
creation of the reduplicant from its root. As a re-
sult, the combination of tones between two sylla-
bles is realized in the following principle: non-flat
tones of the roots are matched against a corre-
sponding flat tones of their reduplicants. That is,
the non-flat root has to select for it the flat redupli-
cant belonging to the same pitch, i.e., in the same
row. In this type of reduplicative words, the root is
stressed in pronunciation.
A detailed statistic about these reduplicative
words with respect to the combination of tones
is given in Table 4. There are 307 reduplicative
words of the second type.
3.3 Reduplication with Final Consonant
According
In this type of reduplication, there is not only the
difference between tones of the root and the redu-
plicant but also the difference between their final
consonants (hence their penultimates). Some ex-
amples of this type of reduplication which we call
the third reduplication type are:
? c?m c?p (clatter, shiver), l?m l?p (pop pop),
x?m x?p (a little full), thi?m thi?p (fall
asleep), n?m n?p (be in a state of suspense)
? gi?n gi?t (sourish), ng?n ng?t (burn vio-
lently), ph?n ph?t (light red), hun h?t (pro-
found), san s?t (be very close to, adjoining)
? v?ng v?c (very clear), nh?ng nh?c (a little
ache), r?ng r?c (brightly), ph?ng ph?c (very
silent), ch?nh ch?ch (a little oblique), anh ?ch
(feeling bloated).
The practical observation shows that the modifica-
tion of final consonant from the root to the dupli-
cate also has a clear rule: the noisy phone of the
root is transformed to a nasal phone of the redu-
plicant as shown in Table 5.
Example At root At reduplicant
Noisy phone Nasal phone
?m ?p -p -m
ph?n ph?t -t -n
v?ng v?c -c -ng
anh ?ch -ch -nh

Sum 232
Table 6: Statistic of the third type reduplication
The transformation of final consonant occurs
only with the roots having as final consonant p,
t, or c. The principle of tone combination is the
same as that of the second reduplication type.
A detailed statistic about these reduplicative
words is given in the Table 6. There are 232 redu-
plicative words of the third type.
Briefly, the total number of reduplicative words
of all the three types of reduplication is 813, mak-
ing up about 813/28, 416 ? 2.86% of the number
of two-syllable words.
4 Implementation
We report in this section the construction of a com-
putational model for recognition and production
of the three types of reduplication presented in
the previous section. We have implemented finite-
state sequential transducers (FSTs) which are able
to recognize and produce corresponding types of
reduplicative words. These devices operate on the
same input and output alphabets, say?, containing
all Vietnamese characters.
FSTs are formal devices for encoding regular re-
lations. A regular relation is a mapping between
two regular languages. In our cases, these lan-
guages are sets of Vietnamese root and reduplicant
syllables.
We adapted nice and efficient algorithms devel-
oped by (Daciuk et al, 2000) to incrementally con-
struct minimal transducers from a source of data.
These algorithms are originally designed to build
optimal deterministic finite-state automata on-the-
fly but they can also be used to construct optimal
66
sequential transducers. We could consider simply
that the alphabet of the automata would be ???;
output strings of ?? are associated with the fi-
nal states of the lexicon and they are only out-
puted once corresponding valid inputs from ? are
recognized. Interested readers are invited to refer
to (Daciuk et al, 2000) for further detail of the al-
gorithms for building optimal automata on-the-fly.
4.1 First Type Transducer
In the first type reduplication, the root and the
reduplicant is completely identical in writing; they
are only distinguished by a stress in pronunciation.
We can simply construct a deterministic finite-
state transducer (FST) f1 that produces redupli-
cants from their roots in which the output string la-
beled on each arc is the same as its input character;
that is f1(x) = x where x is a syllable in the first
type duplication. As an illustration, the following
minimal FST recognizes and generates three first
type reduplicative words lu?n lu?n (always), l? l?
(silently), kh?n kh?n (raucous).

The minimal FST f1 recognizing all 274 redu-
plicative words of the first type consists of 90
states in which 16 states are final ones. It has 330
transitions, the maximum number of outtransitions
from a state is 28.
4.2 Second Type Transducer
In the second type reduplication, the root has an
non-flat tone while its reduplicant has the corre-
sponding flat tone. A root determines for it the
unique reduplicant. Hence we can construct a se-
quential FST f2 which is able to generate redupli-
cants from roots.
For instance, consider two reduplicative words
of the second type lem l?m (glib) and lem l?m
(voluble). They can be recognized by the minimal
sequential FST f2 such that f2(l?m) = lem and
f2(l?m) = lem as depicted in the following figure:
q0 q1 q2 q3l:l
?:e
?:e
m:m
Similarly, the minimal FST f2 which gener-
ates three reduplicative words gi?ng gi?ng (a little
similar), ??ng ??ng (interminable) and ??m ??m
(fixedly) is as follows:
q0 q1
q2
q3 q4
q5q6 q7

m:m
The minimal FST f2 recognizing all 307 redu-
plicative words of the second type consists of 93
states in which 11 states are final ones. It has 371
transitions, the maximum number of outtransitions
from a state is 22.
4.3 Third Type Transducer
The roots and reduplicants in the third type redu-
plication are not only combined by principles of
flat and non-flat tones, they are also distinguised
by last consonants. We know that in the case the
root ends with c, its reduplicant is one character
longer than it. The other three transformations of
last consonants do not change the length of the
reduplicants with respect to that of the roots.
Hence the FST f3 which recognizes the third
type reduplication is required to modify the tones
of the reduplicants with respect to those of the
roots on the one hand, and to transform last conso-
nants of the roots on the other hand. For example,
the minimal FST f3 recognizing four reduplicative
words bi?ng bi?c (bluish green), bi?n bi?t (leave
behind no traces whatsoever), b?nh b?ch (a series
of thudding blows) and b?m b?p (pop pop) is given
in the figure below:

The minimal FST f3 recognizing all 232 redu-
plicative words of the third type consists of 59
67
states in which 2 states are final ones. It has 262
transitions, the maximum number of outtransitions
from a state is 19.
Once all the three transducers have been con-
structed, we can unify them by making use of
the standard union operation on transducers to
obtain a sequential FST which is able to recog-
nize all the three class of reduplication presented
above (Mohri, 1996; Mohri, 1997).
4.4 A Software Package
We have developed a Java software package named
vnReduplicator which implements the above-
mentioned computational model of Vietnamese
reduplication. The core component of this pack-
age is a minimal FST which can recognize a sub-
stantial amount of reduplicative bi-syllabic words
found in the Vietnamese language.
The first application of this core model which
we have developed is a reduplication scanner for
Vietnamese. We use the minimal FST of the core
model to build a tool for fast detection of redu-
plication. The tool scans a given input text and
produces a list of all the recognized reduplicative
words. The detection process is very fast since the
underlying transducer operates in optimal time in
the sense that the time to recognize a syllable cor-
responds to the time required to follow a single
path in the deterministic finite-state machine, and
the length of the path is the length of the syllable
measured in characters.
As an example, given the following input text
?Anh ?i bi?n bi?t. C? v?n ch? anh h?n 20 n?m
??ng ??ng.?2,
the scanner marks two reduplicative words as
shown in the italic face.
We are currently investigating another useful
application of the core model for a partial spell
checking of Vietnamese text. It is observed that
people may make typhographical errors in writing
like ??ng ??ng instead of the correct word ??ng
??ng. In such cases, the computational model can
be exploited to detect the potential errors and sug-
gest corrections.
The reduplication model could also help im-
prove the accuracy of Vietnamese lexical rec-
ognizers in particular and the accuracy of Viet-
namese word segmentation systems in general.
2He has left behind no traces whatsoever. She has been
waiting for him for 20 years.
The reduplication scanner will be integrated to vn-
Tokenizer3 - an open source and highly accurate
tokenizer for Vietnamese texts (Le et al, 2008).
The software and related resources will be dis-
tributed under the GNU General Public Lisence4
and it will be soon available online5.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented for the first time a compu-
tational model for the reduplication of the Viet-
namese language. We show that a large class of
reduplicative words can be modeled effectively by
sequential finite-state string-to-string transducers.
The analysis of the various patterns of redu-
plication of the Vietnamese language has twofold
contributions. On the one hand, it gives useful
information on identification of spelling variants
in Vietnamese texts. On the other hand, it gives
an explicit formalization of precedence relation-
ships in the phonology, and as a result helps or-
dering and modeling phonological processes be-
fore transfer of the presentation to the articulatory
interface.
It is argued that the relation between morphol-
ogy and phonology is an intimate one, both syn-
chronically and diachronically. As mentioned ear-
lier, Vietnamese reduplication is always accompa-
nied by a modification of phone and tone for a
symmetric and harmonic posture. We thus believe
that the compact finite-state description of a large
class of reduplication would help connect mor-
phosyntactic attributes to individual phonological
components of a set of Vietnamese word forms
and contribute to the improvement of Vietnamese
automatic speech recognition systems.
As mentioned earlier, the current work does not
handle partial reduplication in which either the on-
set is repeated or the rhyme and the tone of sylla-
bles are repeated, for example b?ng b?nh (bob),
ch?m ch?m (open slightly one?s lips), l?m c?m
(doting), l?ng t?ng (perplexed, embarrassed). Par-
tial reduplication is a topic which has been well
studied for a long time by Vietnamese linguists
community. It has been shown that partial redu-
plicative words also have certain principle forma-
tion rules (Di?p, 1999; UBKHXH, 1983). Hence,
partial reduplicative words could also be gener-
ated and recognized by an appropriate finite-state

68
model which encodes precisely their formation
rules. This is an interesting topic of our future
work in constructing a rather complete computa-
tional model for Vietnamese bi-syllabic reduplica-
tion.
Furthermore, in addition to the bi-syllabic redu-
plication forms, there exists also three or four syl-
lable reduplication forms, for example c?n c?n con
(very little), t?o t?o teo (very small), or v?i v?i
v?ng v?ng (hurry), ??ng ?? ??ng ??nh (deliber-
ate). These reduplication forms involve the copy-
ing operation of morphological structures which
is a non-regular operation. Non-regular operations
are problematic in that they cannot be cast in terms
of composition ? the regular operation of ma-
jor importance in finite-state devices, while finite-
state devices cannot handle unbounded copying.
However, the question of the possibility for an el-
egant account to reduce these specific kinds of
reduplication to purely regular mechanisms would
be of interest for further research to extend and im-
prove the core reduplication components for Viet-
namese. Unknown reduplicative word guessing is
another interesting and useful topic since the lexi-
con can never cover all reduplicative words.
