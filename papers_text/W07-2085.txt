Abstract
This paper describes a supervised,
knowledge-intensive approach to the auto-
matic identification of semantic relations
between nominals in English sentences.
The system employs different sets of new
and previously used lexical, syntactic, and
semantic features extracted from various
knowledge sources. At SemEval 2007 the
system achieved an F-measure of 72.4% and
an accuracy of 76.3%.
1 Introduction
The SemEval 2007 task on Semantic Relations be-
tween Nominals is to identify the underlying se-
mantic relation between two nouns in the context
of a sentence. The dataset provided consists of a
definition file and 140 training and about 70 test
sentences for each of the seven relations consid-
ered: Cause-Effect, Instrument-Agency, Product-
Producer, Origin-Entity, Theme-Tool, Part-Whole,
and Content-Container. The task is defined as a
binary classification problem. Thus, given a pair
of nouns and their sentential context, the classifier
decides whether the nouns are linked by the target
semantic relation. In each training and test exam-
ple sentence, the nouns are identified and manu-
ally labeled with their corresponding WordNet 3.0
senses. Moreover, each example is accompanied by
the heuristic pattern (query) the annotators used to
extract the sentence from the web and the position
of the arguments in the relation.
(1) 041 ?He derives great joy and <e1>happiness</e1>
from <e2>cycling</e2>.? WordNet(e1) =
?happiness%1:12:00::?, WordNet(e2) = ?cy-
cling%1:04:00::?, Cause-Effect(e2,e1) = ?true?,
Query = ?happiness from *?
Based on the information employed, systems can
be classified in four types of classes: (A) systems
that use neither the given WordNet synsets nor the
queries, (B) systems that use only WordNet senses,
(C) systems that use only the queries, and (D) sys-
tems that use both.
In this paper we present a type-B system that re-
lies on various sets of new and previously used lin-
guistic features employed in a supervised learning
model.
2 Classification of Semantic Relations
Semantic relations between nominals can be en-
coded by different syntactic constructions. We
extend here over previous work that has focused
mainly on noun compounds and other noun phrases,
and noun?verb?noun constructions.
We selected a list of 18 lexico-syntactic and se-
mantic features split here into three sets: feature set
#1 (core features), feature set #2 (context features),
and the feature set #3 (special features). Table 1
shows all three sets of features along with their defi-
nitions; a detailed description is presented next. For
some features, we list previous works where they
proved useful. While features F1 ? F4 were selected
from our previous experiments, all the other features
are entirely the contribution of this research.
Feature set #1: Core features
This set contains six features that were employed
in all seven relation classifiers. The features take
into consideration only lexico-semantic information
386
No. Feature Definition
Feature Set #1: Core features
F1 Argument position indicates the position of the arguments in the semantic relation
(Girju et al, 2005; Girju et al, 2006) (e.g., Part-Whole(e1, e2), where e1 is the part and e2 is the whole).
F2 Semantic specialization this is the prediction returned by the automatic WordNet IS-A semantic
(Girju et al, 2005; Girju et al, 2006) specialization procedure.
F3, F4 Nominalization indicates whether the nouns e1 (F3) and e2 (F4) are nominalizations
(Girju et al, 2004) or not. Specifically, we distinguish here between agential nouns,
other nominalizations, and neither.
F5, F6 Spatio-Temporal features indicate if e1 (F5) or e2 (F6) encode time or location.
Feature Set #2: Context features
F7, F8 Grammatical role describes the grammatical role of e1 (F7) and e2 (F8). There are three
possible values: subject, direct object, or neither.
F9 PP Attachment applies to NP PP constructions and indicates if the prepositional phrase
containing e2 attaches to the NP containing e1.
F10, F11 Semantic Role is concerned with the semantic role of the phrase containing
either e1 (F10) or e2 (F11). In particular, we focused on three semantic
roles: Time, Location, Manner. The feature is set to 1 if the target noun
is part of a phrase of that type and to 0 otherwise.
F12, F13, Inter-noun context sequence is a set of three features. F12 captures the sequence of stemmed
F14 words between e1 and e2, while F13 lists the part of speech sequence in
between the target nouns. F14 is a scoring weight (with possible values
1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125) which measures the similarity of an unseen
sequence to the set of sequence patterns associated with a relation.
Feature Set #3: Special features
F15, F16 Psychological feature is used in the Theme-Tool classifier; indicates if e1 (F15) or e2 (F16)
belong or not to a predefined set of psychological features.
F17 Instrument semantic role is used for the Instrument-Agency relation and indicates whether
the phrase containing e1 is labeled as em Instrument or not.
F18 Syntactic attachment is used for the Instrument-Agent relation and indicates whether the phrase
containing the Instrument role attaches to a noun or a verb
Table 1: The three sets of features used for the automatic semantic relation classification.
about the two target nouns.
Argument position (F1) indicates the position of
the semantic arguments in the relation. This infor-
mation is very valuable, since some relations have a
particular argument arrangement depending on the
lexico-syntactic construction in which they occur.
For example, most of the noun compounds encod-
ing Stuff-Object / Part-Whole relations have e1 as
the part and e2 as the whole (e.g., silk dress).
Semantic specialization (F2) is a binary feature
representing the prediction of a semantic specializa-
tion learning model. The method consists of a set
of iterative procedures of specialization of the train-
ing examples on the WordNet IS-A hierarchy. Thus,
after all the initial noun?noun pairs are mapped
through generalization to entity ? entity pairs in
WordNet, a set of necessary specialization iterations
is applied until it finds a boundary that separates pos-
itive and negative examples. This boundary is tested
on new examples for relation prediction.
The nominalization features (F3, F4) indicate if
the target noun is a nominalization and, if yes, of
what type. We distinguish here between agential
nouns, other nominalizations, and neither. The
features were identified based on WordNet and
NomLex-Plus1 and were introduced to filter some
of negative examples, such as car owner/THEME.
Spatio?Temporal features (F5, F6) were also in-
troduced to recognize some near miss examples,
such as Temporal and Location relations. For in-
stance, activation by summer (near-miss for Cause-
Effect) and mouse in the field (near-miss for Content-
Container). Similarly, for Theme-Tool, a word act-
ing as a Theme should not indicate a period of time,
as in <e1>the appointment</e1> was for more
than one <e2>year</e2>. For this we used the in-
formation provided by WordNet and special classes
generated from the works of (Herskovits, 1987),
(Linstromberg, 1997), and (Tyler and Evans, 2003).
1NomLex-Plus is a hand-coded database of 5,000 verb nom-
inalizations, de-adjectival, and de-adverbial nouns.

Feature set #2: Context features
This set takes advantage of the sentence context to
identify features at different linguistic levels.
The grammatical role features (F7, F8) determine
if e1 or e2 is the subject, direct object, or neither.
This feature helps filter out some instances with poor
context, such as noun compounds and identify some
near-miss examples. For example, a restriction im-
posed by the definition of Theme-Tool indicates that
in constructions such as Y/Tool is used for V-ing
X/Theme, neither X nor Y can be the subject of
the sentence, and hence Theme-Tool(X, Y) would be
false. This restriction is also captured by the nomi-
nalization feature in case X or Y is an agential noun.
PP attachment (F9) is defined for NP PP construc-
tions, where the prepositional phrase containing the
noun e2 attaches or not to the NP (containing e1).
The rationale is to identify negative instances where
the PP attaches to any other word before NP in the
sentence. For example, eat <e1>pizza</e1> with
<e2>a fork</e2>, where with a fork attaches to
the verb to eat (cf. (Charniak, 2000)).
Furthermore, we implemented and used two se-
mantic role features which identify the semantic role
of the phrase in a verb?argument structure, phrase
containing either e1 (F10) or e2 (F11). In particular,
we focus on three semantic roles: Time, Location,
Manner. The feature is set to 1 if the target noun
is part of a semantic role phrase and to 0 otherwise.
The idea is to filter out near-miss examples, expe-
cially for the Instrument-Agency relation. For this,
we used ASSERT, a semantic role labeler developed
at the University of Colorado at Boulder2 which was
queried through a web interface.
Inter-noun context sequence features (F12, F13)
encode the sequence of lexical and part of speech
information between the two target nouns. Feature
F14 is a weight feature on the values of F12 and
F13 and indicates how similar a new sequence is to
the already observed inter-noun context associated
with the relation. If there is a direct match, then the
weight is set to 1. If the part-of-speech pattern of the
new substring matches that of an already seen sub-
string, then the weight is set to 0.5. Weights 0.25
and 0.125 are given to those sequences that overlap
entirely or partially with patterns encoding other se-
2http://oak.colorado.edu/assert/
mantic relations in the same contingency set (e.g.,
semantic relations that share syntactic pattern se-
quences). The value of the feature is the summation
of the weights thus obtained. The rationale is that
the greater the weight, the more representative is the
context sequence for that relation.
Feature set #3: Special features
This set includes features that help identify specific
information about some semantic relations.
Psychological feature was defined for the Theme-
Tool relation and indicates if the target noun (F15,
F16) belongs to a list of special concepts. This fea-
ture was obtained from the restrictions listed in the
definition of Theme-Tool. In the example need for
money, the noun need is a psychological feature, and
thus the instance cannot encode a Theme-Tool rela-
tion. A list of synsets from WordNet subhierarchy
of motivation and cognition constituted the psycho-
logical factors. This was augmented with precondi-
tions such as foundation and requirement since they
would not be allowed as tools for the theme.
The Instrument semantic role is used for the
Instrument-Agency relation as a boolean feature
(F17) indicating whether the argument identified as
Instrument in the relation (e.g., e1 if Instrument-
Agency(e1, e2)) belongs to an instrument phrase as
identified by a semantic role tool, such as ASSERT.
The syntactic attachment feature (F18) is a fea-
ture that indicates whether the argument identified
as Instrument in the relation attaches to a verb or to
a noun in the syntactically parsed sentence.
3 Learning Model and Experimental
Setting
For our experiments we chose libSVM, an open
source SVM package3. Since some of our features
are nominal, we followed the standard practice of
representing a nominal feature with n discrete val-
ues as n binary features. We used the RBF kernel.
We built a binary classifier for each of the seven
relations. Since the size of the task training data per
relation is small, we expanded it with new examples
from various sources. We added a new corpus of
3,000 sentences of news articles from the TREC-9
text collection (Girju, 2003) encoding Cause-Effect
(1,320) and Product-Producer (721). Another col-

lection of 3,129 sentences from Wall Street Journal
(Moldovan et al, 2004; Girju et al, 2004) was con-
sidered for Part-Whole (1,003), Origin-Entity (167),
Product-Producer (112), and Theme-Tool (91). We
also extracted 552 Product-Producer instances from
eXtended WordNet4 (noun entries and their gloss
definition). Moreover, for Theme-Tool and Content-
Container we used special lists of constraints5. Be-
sides the selectional restrictions imposed on the
nouns by special features such as F15 and F16 (psy-
chological feature), we created lists of containers
from various thesauri6 and identified selectional re-
strictions that differentiate between containers and
locations relying on taxonomies of spatial entities
discussed in detail in (Herskovits, 1987) and (Tyler
and Evans, 2003).
Each instance in this text collection had the tar-
get nouns identified and annotated with WordNet
senses. Since the annotations used different Word-
Net versions, senses were mapped to sense keys.
4 Experimental Results
Table 2 shows the performance of our system for
each semantic relation. Base-F indicates the base-
line F-measure (all true), while Base-Acc shows the
baseline accuracy score (majority). The Average
score of precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy
is macroaveraged over all seven relations. Overall,
all features contributed to the performance, with a
different contribution per relation (cf. Table 2).
5 Conclusions
This paper describes a method for the automatic
identification of a set of seven semantic relations

5The Instrument-Agency classifier was trained only on the
task dataset.
6Thesauri such as TheFreeDictionary.com.
based on support vector machines (SVMs). The ap-
proach benefits from an extended dataset on which
binary classifiers were trained for each relation. The
feature sets fed into the SVMs produced very good
results.
