Abstract
Resolving ambiguity associated with names
found on the Web, Wikipedia or medical texts
is a very challenging task, which has been
of great interest to the research community.
We propose a novel approach to disambiguat-
ing names using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
where the learned topics represent the under-
lying senses of the ambiguous name. We con-
duct a detailed evaluation on multiple data sets
containing ambiguous person, location and or-
ganization names and for multiple languages
such as English, Spanish, Romanian and Bul-
garian. We conduct comparative studies with
existing approaches and show a substantial
improvement of 15 to 35% in task accuracy.
1 Introduction
Recently, ambiguity resolution for names found on
the Web (Artiles et al, 2007), Wikipedia articles
(Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), news texts (Pedersen et
al., 2005) and medical literature (Ginter et al, 2004)
has become an active area of research. Like words,
names are ambiguous and can refer to multiple enti-
ties. For example, a Web search for Jerry Hobbs on
Google returns a mixture of documents associated
with two different entities in the top 10 search re-
sults. One refers to a computational linguist at Uni-
versity of Southern California and the other refers to
a fugitive and murderer. Disambiguating the names
and identifying the correct entity is very important
especially for Web search applications since 11-17%
of the Web search queries are composed of person
name and a term (Artiles et al, 2009a).
In the past, there has been a substantial body of
work in the area of name disambiguation under a va-
riety of different names and using diverse set of ap-
proaches. Some refer to the task as cross-document
coreference resolution (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998),
name discrimination (Pedersen et al, 2005) or Web
People Search (WebPS) (Artiles et al, 2007). The
majority of the approaches focus on person name
ambiguity (Chen and Martin, 2007; Artiles et al,
2010), some have also explored organization and lo-
cation name disambiguation (Pedersen et al, 2006).
The intuition behind most approaches follows the
distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) according
to which ambiguous names sharing the same con-
texts tend to refer to the same individual. To model
these characteristics, Bunescu and Pasca (2006)
and Cucerzan (2007) incorporate information from
Wikipedia articles, Artiles et al (2007) use Web
page content, Mann and Yarowsky (2003) extract bi-
ographic facts. The approaches used in the WebPS
tasks mainly rely on bag-of-words representations
(Artiles et al, 2007; Chen and Martin, 2007; Artiles
et al, 2009b). Most methods suffer from a com-
mon drawback?they rely on surface features such
as word co-occurrences, which are insufficient to
capture hidden information pertaining to the entities
(senses) associated with the documents.
We take a novel approach for tackling the prob-
lem of name ambiguity using an unsupervised topic
modeling framework. To our knowledge, no one
has yet explored the disambiguation of names using
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) nor has shown
LDA?s behavior on multiple data sources and set-
tings. Our motivation for using an unsupervised
105
topic modeling framework for name disambiguation
is based on the advantages generative models offer
in contrast to the existing ones. For instance, topic
models such as Latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA)
method (Blei et al, 2003) have been widely used in
the literature for other applications to uncover hid-
den (or latent) groupings underlying a set of obser-
vations. Topic models are capable of handling ambi-
guity and distinguishing between uses of words with
multiple meanings depending on context. Thereby,
they provide a natural fit for our name disambigua-
tion task, where latent topics correspond to the en-
tities (name senses) representing the documents for
an ambiguous name. Identifying these latent topics
helps us identify the particular sense of a given am-
biguous name that is used in the context of a particu-
lar document and hence resolve name ambiguity. In
addition, this approach offers several advantages?
(1) entities (senses) can be learnt automatically from
a collection of documents in an unsupervised man-
ner, (2) efficient methods already exist for perform-
ing inference in this model so we can easily scale
to Web data, and (3) unlike typical approaches, we
can easily apply our learnt model to resolve name
ambiguity for unseen documents.
The main contributions of this paper are:
? We propose a novel model for name disam-
biguation using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
? Unlike previous approaches, which are de-
signed for specific tasks, corpora and lan-
guages, we conduct a detailed evaluation taking
into consideration the multiple properties of the
data and names.
? Our experimental study shows that LDA can be
used as a general name disambiguation frame-
work, which can be successfully applied on
any corpora (i.e. Web, news, Wikipedia), lan-
guages (i.e. English, Spanish, Romanian and
Bulgarian) and types of ambiguous names (i.e.
people, organizations, locations).
? We conduct a comparative study with existing
state-of-the-art clustering approaches and show
substantial improvements of 15 to 35% in task
accuracy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2 we describe related work. Section 3 describes
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model used to dis-
ambiguate the names. Section 4 describes the exper-
iments we have conducted on multiple data sets and
languages. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Ambiguous names have been disambiguated with
varying success from structured texts (Pedersen et
al., 2006), semi-structured texts such as Wikipedia
articles (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007)
or unstructured texts such as those found on the Web
(Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2007; Artiles et al, 2009b).
Most approaches (Artiles et al, 2009b; Chen et al,
2009; Lan et al, 2009) focus on person name dis-
ambiguation, while others (Pedersen et al, 2006)
also explore ambiguity in organization and location
names. In the medical domain, Hatzivassiloglou et
al. (2001) and Ginter et al (2004) tackle the problem
of gene and protein name disambiguation.
Due to the high interest in this task, researchers
have explored a wide range of approaches and fea-
tures. Among the most common and efficient ones
are those based on clustering and bag-of-words rep-
resentation (Pedersen et al, 2005; Artiles et al,
2009b). Mann and Yarowsky (2003) extract bio-
graphic facts such as date or place of birth, occu-
pation, relatives among others to help resolve am-
biguous names of people. Others (Bunescu and
Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Nguyen and Cao,
2008) work on Wikipedia articles, using infobox
and link information. Pedersen et al (2006) rely
on second order co-occurrence vectors. A few oth-
ers (Matthias, 2005; Wan et al, 2005; Popescu and
Magnini, 2007) identify names of people, locations
and organizations and use them as a source of evi-
dence to measure the similarity between documents
containing the ambiguous names. The most simi-
lar work to ours is that of Song et al (2007) who
use a topic-based modeling approach for name dis-
ambiguation. However, their method explicitly tries
to model the distribution of latent topics with regard
to person names and words appearing within docu-
ments whereas in our method, the latent topics rep-
resent the underlying entities (name senses) for an
ambiguous name.
Unlike the previous approaches which were
specifically designed and evaluated on the WebPS
106
task or a corpus such as Wikipedia or the Web, in
this paper we show a novel unsupervised topic mod-
eling approach for name disambiguation for any cor-
pora (i.e. Web, news, Wikipedia), languages (i.e.
English, Spanish, Romanian and Bulgarian) and se-
mantic categories (i.e. people, location and organi-
zation). The obtained results show substantial im-
provements over the existing approaches.
3 Name Disambiguation with LDA
Recently, topic modeling methods have found
widespread applications in NLP for various
tasks such as summarization (Daume? III and
Marcu, 2006), inferring concept-attribute attach-
ments (Reisinger and Pasca, 2009), selectional
preferences (Ritter et al, 2010) and cross-document
co-reference resolution (Haghighi and Klein, 2010).
Topic models such as LDA are generative models
for documents and represent hidden or latent top-
ics (where a topic is a probability distribution over
words) underlying the semantic structure of docu-
ments. An important use for methods such as LDA
is to infer the set of topics associated with a given
document (or a collection of documents). Next, we
present a novel approach for the task of name dis-
ambiguation using unsupervised topic models.
3.1 Method Description
Given a document corpus D associated with a cer-
tain ambiguous name, our task is to group the docu-
ments into K sets such that each document set cor-
responds to one particular entity (sense) for the am-
biguous name. We first formulate the name disam-
biguation problem as a topic modeling task and then
apply the standard LDA method to infer hidden top-
ics (senses). Our generative story is as follows:
for each name sense sk where k ? {1, ...,K} do
Generate ?sk according to Dir(?)
end for
for each document i in the corpus D do
Choose ?i ? Dir(?)
for each word wi,j where j ? {1, ..., Ni} do
Choose a sense zi,j ?Multinomial(?i)
Choose a word wi,j ?Multinomial(?zi,j )
end for
end for
3.2 Inference
We perform inference on this model using collapsed
Gibbs sampling, where each of the hidden sense
variables zi,j are sampled conditioned on an as-
signment for all other variables, while integrating
over all possible parameter settings (Griffiths and
Steyvers, 2002). We use the MALLET (McCallum,
2002) implementation of LDA for our experiments.
We ran LDA with different parameter settings on a
held out data set and found that the following con-
figuration resulted in the best performance. We set
the hyperparameter ? to the default value of 0.01.
For the name discrimination task, we have to choose
from a smaller set of name senses and each docu-
ment is representative of a single sense, so we use
a sparse prior (?=0.1). On the other hand, the Web
People Search data is more noisy and also involves
a large number of senses, so we use a higher prior
(?=50).
For the name discrimination task (Section 4.1),
we are given a set of senses to choose from and
hence we can use this value to fix the number of top-
ics (senses) K in LDA. However, it is possible that
the number of senses may be unknown to us apriori.
For example, it is difficult to identify all the senses
associated with names of people on the Web. In such
scenarios, we set the value ofK to a fixed value. For
experiments on Web People Search, we set K = 40,
which is roughly the average number of senses as-
sociated with people names on the Web. An alter-
native strategy is to automatically choose the num-
ber of senses based on the model that leads to the
highest posterior probability (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004). It is easy to incorporate this technique into
our model, but we leave this for future work.
3.3 Interpreting Name Senses From Topics
As a result of training, our model outputs the topic
(sense) distributions for each document in the cor-
pus. Although the LDA model can assign multi-
ple senses to a document, the name disambiguation
task specifies that each document should be assigned
only to a single name sense. Hence, for each docu-
ment i we assign it the most probable sense from its
sense distribution. This allows us to cluster all the
documents in D into K sets.
To evaluate our results against the gold standard
107
data, we further need to find a mapping between our
document clusters and the true name sense labels.
For each cluster k, we identify the true sense labels
(using the gold data) for every document which was
assigned to sense k in our output, and pick the ma-
jority sense label labelkmaj. as being representative
of the entire cluster (i.e., all documents in cluster k
will be labeled as belonging to sense labelkmaj.). Fi-
nally, we evaluate our labeling against the gold data.
4 Experimental Evaluation
Our objective is to study LDA?s performance on
multiple datasets, name categories and languages.
For this purpose, we evaluate our approach on two
tasks: name discrimination and Web People Search,
which are described in the next subsections. We use
freely available data from (Pedersen et al, 2006) and
(Artiles et al, 2009b), which enable us to compare
performance against existing methods.
4.1 Name Discrimination
Pedersen et al (2006) create ambiguous data by
conflating together tuples of non-ambiguous well
known names. The goal is to cluster the contexts
containing the conflated names such that the origi-
nal and correct names are re-discovered. This task is
known as name discrimination.
An advantage of the name conflation process is
that data can be easily created for any type of names
and languages. In our study, we use the whole data
set developed by Pedersen et al (2006) for the En-
glish, Spanish, Romanian and Bulgarian languages.
Table 1 shows the conflated names and the seman-
tic category they belong to (i.e. person, organization
or location) together with the distribution of the in-
stances for each underlying entity in the name. In
total there are eight person, eight location and three
organization conflated name pairs which represent a
diverse set of names of politicians, countries, cities,
political parties and software companies. For four
conflated name pairs the data is balanced. For ex-
ample, there are 3800 examples in total for the con-
flated name Bill Clinton ? Tony Blair of which 1900
are for the underlying entity Bill Clinton and 1900
for Tony Blair. For the rest of the cases the data is
imbalanced. For example, there are 3344 examples
for the conflated name Yaser Arafat ? Bill Clinton of
which 1004 belong to Yaser Arafat and 2340 to Bill
Clinton. The balanced and imbalanced data also lets
us study whether LDA?s performance if affected by
the different sense distributions.
Next, we show in Table 2 the overall results from
the disambiguation process. For each name, we first
show the baseline score which is calculated as the
percentage of instances belonging to the most fre-
quent underlying entity over all instances of that
conflated name pair. For example, for the Bill Clin-
ton ? Tony Blair conflated name pair, the baseline
is 50% since both underlying entities have the same
number of examples. This baseline is equivalent to
a clustering method that would assign all of the con-
texts to exactly one cluster.
The second column corresponds to the results
achieved by the second order co-occurrence cluster-
ing approach of (Pedersen et al, 2006). This ap-
proach is considered as state-of-the-art in name dis-
crimination after numerous features like unigram,
bigram, co-occurrence and multiple clustering algo-
rithms were tested. We denote this approach in Table
2 as Pedersen and use it as a comparison. Note that
in this experiment (Pedersen et al, 2006) predefine
the exact number of clusters, therefore we also use
the exact number of senses for the LDA topics. The
third column shows the results obtained by our LDA
approach. The final two columns represent the dif-
ference between our LDA approach and the baseline
denoted as ?B , as well as the difference between
our LDA approach and those of Pedersen denoted as
?P . We have highlighted in bold the improvements
of LDA over these methods.
The obtained results show that for all experiments
independent of whether the name sense data was bal-
anced or imbalanced, LDA has a positive increase
over the baseline. For some conflated tuples like the
Spanish NATO?ETZIN, the improvement over the
baseline is 47%. For seventeen out of the twenty
name conflated pairs LDA has also improved upon
Pedersen. The improvements range from +1.29 to
+19.18.
Unfortunately, we are not deeply familiar with
Romanian to provide a detailed analysis of the con-
texts and the errors that occurred. However, we no-
ticed that for English, Spanish and Bulgarian often
the same context containing two or three of the con-
flated names is used multiple times. Imagine that

there is a single context in which both names Nade-
jda Mihaylova and Stoyan Stoyanov are mentioned.
This context is used to create two name conflated
examples. In the first case only the name Nadejda
Mihaylova was hidden with the Nadejda Mihaylova
? Nikolay Vasilev ? Stoyan Stoyanov label while the
name Stoyan Stoyanov was preserved as it is. In
the second case, the name Stoyan Stoyanov was hid-
den with the label Nadejda Mihaylova ? Nikolay
Vasilev ? Stoyan Stoyanov while the name Nadejda
Mihaylova was preserved. Since the example con-
tains two name conflations of the same context, it
becomes very difficult for any algorithm to identify
this phenomenon and discriminate the names cor-
rectly.
According to a study conducted by (Pedersen et
al., 2006), the conflated entities in the automatically
collected data sets can be ambiguous and can be-
long to multiple semantic categories. For example,
they mention that the city Varna occurred in the col-
lection as part of other named entities such as the
University of Varna, the Townhall of Varna. There-
fore, by conflating the name Varna in the organiza-
tion named entity University of Varna, the context
starts to deviate the meaning of Varna as a city into
the meaning of university. Such cases transmit ad-
ditional ambiguity to the conflated name pair and
make the task even harder.
Finally, our current approach does not use stop-
words except for English. According to Pedersen et
al. (2006) the usage of stop-words is crucial for this
task and leads to a substantial improvement.
4.2 Web People Search
Recently, Artiles et al (2009b) introduced the Web
People Search task (WebPS), where given the top
100 web search results produced for an ambiguous
person name, the goal is to produce clusters that con-
tain documents referring to the same individual.
We have randomly selected from the WebPS-2
test data three names from the Wikipedia, ACL?08
and Census categories. Unlike the previous data,
WebPS has (1) names with higher ambiguity from
3 to 56 entities per name, (2) only person names and
(3) unstructured and semi-structured texts from the
Web and Wikipedia1. Table 3 shows the number of
1We clean all html tags and remove stopwords.
entities (senses) (#E) and the number of documents
for each ambiguous name (#Doc).
In contrast to the previous task where the number
of topics is equal to the exact number of senses, in
this task the number of topics is approximate to the
number of senses2. In our experiments we set the
number of topics to 40. We embarked on this exper-
imental set up in order to make our results compara-
ble with the rest of the systems in WebPS. However,
if we use the exact number of name senses then LDA
achieves higher results.
To evaluate the performance of our approach, we
use the official WebPS evaluation script. We re-
port BCubed Precision, Recall and F-scores for our
LDA approach, two baseline systems and the ECNU
(Lan et al, 2009) system from the WebPS-2 chal-
lenge. We compare our results against ECNL, be-
cause they use similar word representation but in-
stead of relying on LDA they use a clustering algo-
rithm. We denote in Table 3 the difference between
the F-score performances of LDA and the ECNU
system as ?F1 . We highlight the differences in bold.
Since a name disambiguation system must have
good precision and recall results, we decided to
compare our results against two baselines which rep-
resent the extreme case of a system that reaches
100% precision (called ONE-IN-ONE) or a sys-
tem that reaches 100% recall (called ALL-IN-ONE).
Practically ONE-IN-ONE corresponds to assign-
ing each document to a different cluster (individ-
ual sense), while the ALL-IN-ONE baseline groups
together all web pages into a single cluster corre-
sponding to one name sense (the majority sense). A
more detailed explanation about the evaluation mea-
sures and the intuition behind them can be found in
(Artiles et al, 2007) and (Artiles et al, 2009b).
For six out of the nine names, LDA outperformed
the two baselines and the ECNU system with 5 to
41% on F-score. Precision and recall scores for LDA
are comparable except for Tom Linton and Helen
Thomas where precision is much higher. The de-
crease in performance is due to the low number of
senses (entities associated with a name) and the fact
that LDA was tuned to produce 40 topics. To over-
come this limitation, in the future we plan to work
on estimating the number of topics automatically.
2Researchers use from 15 to 50 number of clusters/senses.

5 Conclusion
We have shown how ambiguity in names can be
modeled and resolved using a generative probabilis-
tic model. Our LDA approach learns a distribution
over topics which correspond to entities (senses) as-
sociated with an ambiguous name. We evaluate our
novel approach on two tasks: name discrimination
and Web People Search. We conduct a detailed eval-
uation on (1) Web, Wikipedia and news documents;
(2) English, Spanish, Romanian and Bulgarian lan-
guages; (3) people, location and organization names.
Our method achieves consistent performance and
substantial improvements over baseline and existing
state-of-the-art clustering methods.
In the future, we would like to model the bi-
ographical fact extraction approach of (Mann and
Yarowsky, 2003) in our LDA model. We plan to es-
timate the number of topics automatically from the
distributions. We want to explore variants of our
current model. For example, currently all words are
generated by multiple topics (senses), but ideally we
want them to be generated by a single topic. Finally,
