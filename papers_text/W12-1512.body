Abstract
During the last decade, there has been
a shift from developing natural lan-
guage generation systems to developing
generic systems that are capable of pro-
ducing natural language descriptions di-
rectly from Web ontologies. To make
these descriptions coherent and accessi-
ble in different languages, a methodol-
ogy is needed for identifying the gen-
eral principles that would determine the
distribution of referential forms. Pre-
vious work has proved through cross-
linguistic investigations that strategies for
building coreference are language depen-
dent. However, to our knowledge, there is
no language generation methodology that
makes a distinction between languages
about the generation of referential chains.
To determine the principles governing
referential chains, we gathered data from
three languages: English, Swedish and
Hebrew, and studied how coreference is
expressed in a discourse. As a result of
the study, a set of language specific coref-
erence strategies were identified. Using
these strategies, an ontology-based mul-
tilingual grammar for generating writ-
ten natural language descriptions about
paintings was implemented in the Gram-
matical Framework. A preliminary eval-
uation of our method shows language-
dependent coreference strategies lead to
better generation results.

1 Introduction
During the last decade, there has been a shift
from developing natural language generation
systems to developing generic systems that are
capable of producing natural language descrip-
tions directly from Web ontologies (Schwitter
and Tilbrook, 2004; Fuchs et al., 2008; Williams
et al., 2011). These systems employ controlled
language mechanisms and Natural Language
Generation (NLG) technologies such as dis-
course structures and simple aggregation meth-
ods to verbalise Web ontology statements, as
exemplified in figure 1.
If we want to adapt such systems to the gen-
eration of coherent multilingual object descrip-
tions, at least three language dependent prob-
lems must be faced, viz. lexicalisation, aggre-
gation and generation of referring expressions.
The ontology itself may contain the lexical in-

formation needed to generate natural language
(McCrae et al., 2012) but it may not carry any
information either about the aggregation of se-
mantic concepts or the generation of a coher-
ent discourse from referring expressions. Hall-
iday and Hasan (1976), and other well known
theories such as Centering Theory (Grosz et
al., 1995), propose establishing a coherent de-
scription by replacing the entity referring to the
Main Subject Reference (MSR) with a pronoun
? a replacement which might result in sim-
ple descriptions such as illustrated in figure 2.
Although these descriptions are coherent, i.e.
they have a connectedness that contributes to
the reader?s understanding of the text, they are
considered non-idiomatic and undeveloped by
many readers because of consecutive pronouns
? a usage which in this particular context is un-
acceptable.
Since previous theories do not specify the
types of linguistic expressions different enti-
ties may bear in different languages or do-
mains, there remain many open questions that
need to be addressed. The question addressed
here is the choice of referential forms to re-
place a sequence of pronouns, which makes
the discourse coherent in different languages.
Our claim is that different languages use dif-
ferent linguistic expressions when referring to
a discourse entity depending on the seman-
tic context. Hence a natural language gen-
erator must employ language dependent co-
referential strategies to produce coherent de-
scriptions. This claim is based on cross-
linguistic investigations into how coreference
is expressed, depending on the target language
and the domain (Giv?n, 1983; Hein, 1989; Ariel,
1990; Prince, 1992; Vallduv? and Engdahl, 1996).
In this paper we present a contrasting study
conducted in English, Swedish and Hebrew to
learn how coreference is expressed. The study
was carried out in the domain of art, more
specifically focusing on naturally-occurring
museum object descriptions. As a result of the
study, strategies for generating coreference in
three languages are suggested. We show how
these strategies are captured in a grammar de-
veloped in the Grammatical Framework (GF).1
We evaluated our method by experimenting
with lexicalised semantic web ontology state-
ments which were structured according to par-
ticular organizing principles. The result of the
evaluation shows language-dependent corefer-
ence strategies lead to better generation results.
2 Related work
Also Prasad (2003) employed a corpus-based
methodology to study the usage of referring ex-
pressions. Based on the results of the analy-
sis, he developed an algorithm to generate ref-
erential chains in Hindi. Other algorithms for
characterizing referential expressions based on
corpus studies have been proposed and imple-
mented in Japanese (Walker et al., 1996), Ital-
ian (Di Eugenio, 1998), Catalan and Spanish
(Potau, 2008), and Romanian (Harabagiu and
Maiorano, 2000).
Although there has been computational
work related to Centering for generating a co-
herent text (Kibble and Power, 2000; Barzilay
and Lee, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2009), we are
not aware of any methodology or NLG system
that employs ontologies to guide the generation
of referential chains depending on the language
considered.

To study the domain-specific conventions and
the ways of signalling linguistic content in En-

glish, Swedish and Hebrew, we collected ob-
ject descriptions written by native speakers of
each language from digital libraries that are
available through on-line museum databases.
The majority of the Swedish descriptions were
taken from the World Culture Museum.2 The
majority of the English descriptions were col-
lected from the Metropolitan Museum.3 The
majority of the Hebrew descriptions were taken
from Artchive.4 Table 1 gives an overview of
the three text collections. In addition, we ex-
tracted 40 parallel texts that are available under
the sub-domain Painting from Wikipedia.

3.2 Syntactic annotation
All sentences in the reference material were
tokenised, part-of-speech tagged, lemmatized,
and parsed using open-source software. We
used Hunpos, an open-source Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) tagger (Hal?csy et al., 2007) and
Maltparser, version 1.4 (Nivre et al., 2007). The
English model for tagging was downloaded
from the Hunpos web page.5 The model for
Swedish was trained on the Stockholm Ume?
Corpus (SUC) and is available to download
from the Swedish Language Bank web page.6
The Hebrew tagger and parsing models are de-
scribed in Goldberg and Elhadad (2010).
3.3 Semantic annotation
The texts were semantically annotated by the
author. The annotation schema for the seman-
tic annotation is taken from the CIDOC Con-

3.4 Referential expressions annotation
The task of identifying referential instances of
a painting entity, which is our main subject
reference, requires a meaningful semantic def-
inition of the concept Man-Made Object. Such
a fine-grained semantic definition is available
in the ontology of paintings (Dann?lls, 2011),9
which was developed in the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) to allow expressing useful
descriptions of paintings.10 The ontology con-
tains specific concepts of painting types, exam-
ples of the hierarchy of concepts that are speci-
fied in the ontology are listed below.
subClassOf(Artwork, E22_Man-Made_Object)
subClassOf(Painting, Artwork)
subClassOf(PortraitPainting, Painting and
depicts(Painting, AnimateThing))
subClassOf(OilPainting, Painting and
hasMaterial(Painting, OilPaint))
When analysing the corpus-data, we look
closer at two linguistic forms of reference ex-
pressions: definite noun phrases and pronouns,
focusing on three semantic relations: direct hy-
pernym (for example Painting is direct hyper-
nym of Portrait Painting), higher hypernym (for
example, both Artwork and Man-Made Object
are higher hypernyms of Portrait Painting) and

reference expressions belonging to the same
concept.
3.5 Data analysis and results
The analysis consisted of two phases: (1) anal-
yse the texts for discourse patterns, and (2)
analyse the texts for patterns of coreference in
the discourse.
Discourse patterns A discourse pattern (DP)
is an approach to text structuring through
which particular organizing principles of the
texts are defined through linguistic analysis.
The approach follows McKeown (1985) to for-
malize principles of discourse for use in a com-
putational process. Following this approach,
we have identified three discourse patterns for
describing paintings that are common in the
three languages. These are summarised below.
? DP1 Man-Made_Object, Object-Type, Ac-
tor, Time-span, Place, Dimension
? DP2 Man-Made_Object, Time-span,
Object-Type, Actor, Dimension, Place
? DP3 Man-Made_Object, Actor, Time-span,
Dimension, Place
Patterns of coreference In the analysis for
coreference, we only considered entities ap-
pearing in subject positions. Below follows ex-
amples of the most common types of corefer-
ence found in the corpus-data.
As seen in (1b) and in many other exam-
ples, the first reference expressions are the def-
inite noun phrase the painting, i.e. coreference
is build through the direct hypernym relation.
The choice of the reference expression in the fol-
lowing sentence (1c) is the definite noun phrase
the work, which is a higher hypernym of the
main subject of reference The Old Musician.
(1) a. The Old Musician is an 1862 painting
by French painter, ?douard Manet.
b. The painting shows the influence of
the work of Gustave Courbet.
c. This work is one of Manet?s largest
paintings and ? is now conserved at
the National Gallery of Art in
Washington.
Sentence (2b) shows a noun is avoided; the
linguistic unit of the reference expression is a
pronoun preceding a conjunction, followed by
an ellipsis.
(2) a. The Birth of Venus is a painting by
the French artist Alexandre Cabanel.
b. It was painted in 1863, and ? is now
in the Mus?e d?Orsay in Paris.
In the Swedish texts we also find occurrences
of pronouns in the second sentence of the dis-
course, as in (3b). We learn that the most com-
mon linguistic units of the reference expres-
sions also are definite noun phrases given by
the direct hypernym relation.

1889. (b) Since 1941 it was in the
permanent exhibition of the museum in
New York. (c) The picture is widely
hailed as his magnum opus and has been
reproduced many times.)
Similar to English, the most common linguis-
tic units of the reference expressions are definite
noun phrases, as in (4b). However, the relation
of these phrases with respect to the main sub-
ject of reference is either a direct hypernym or a
synonym, such as tavlan in (3c) and (5b).

((a) The Baptists is a painting by Gustaf
Cederstr?m from 1886, and depicts
baptists that have gathered for a bad.
(b) The picture can be seen in Betel at the
people?s high school premises.)
The Hebrew examples also include definite
noun phrases determined by the direct hyper-
nym relation, as hastiyor in (6b). Pronouns only
occur in a context that contains a comparison,
for example (6c). In other cases, e.g. (7b), (7c),
the relation selected for the reference expres-
sion is higher-hypernym.

3.6 The results of the analysis
The above examples show a range of differ-
ences in the way chains of coreference are con-
structed. Table 3 summarizes the results the
analysis revealed. 1st, 2nd and 3rd correspond
to the first, second and third reference expres-
sion in the discourse. In summary, we found:
? Pronoun is common in Swedish and En-
glish, and rare in Hebrew
? Direct-hypernym is common in English,
Swedish and Hebrew
? Higher-hypernym is rare in English and
Swedish, and common in Hebrew
? Synonym is common in Swedish, less fre-
quent in English, and rare in Hebrew

Although the identified strategies are con-
strained by a relatively simple syntax and
a domain ontology, they show clear differ-
ences between the languages. As table 3
shows, consecutive pronouns occur commonly
in English, while consecutive higher hypernym
noun phrases are common in Hebrew.
4 Generating referential chains from
Web ontology
4.1 Experimental data
We made use of the data available in the paint-
ing ontology presented in section 3.4 to gener-
ate multilingual descriptions by following the
domain discourse patterns. The data consists of
around 1000 ontology statements and over 250
lexicalised entities extracted from the Swedish
National Museums of World Culture and the
Gothenburg City Museum.
4.2 The generation grammar
The grammar was implemented in GF, a gram-
mar formalism oriented toward multilingual
grammar development and generation (Ranta,
2004). It is a logical framework based on a gen-
eral treatment of syntax, rules, and proofs by
means of a typed ?-calculus with dependent
types (Ranta, 1994). Similar to other logical
formalisms, GF separates between abstract and
concrete syntaxes. The abstract syntax reflects
the type theoretical part of a grammar. The con-
crete syntax is formulated as a set of lineariza-
tion rules that can be superimposed on an ab-
stract syntax to generate words, phrases, sen-
tences, and texts of a desirable language. In ad-
dition, GF has an associated grammar library
(Ranta, 2009); a set of parallel natural language
grammars that can be used as a resource for
various language processing tasks.
Our grammar consists of one abstract mod-
ule that reflects the domain knowledge and is
common to all languages, plus three concrete
modules, one for each language, which en-
code the language dependent strategies. Rather
than giving details of the grammatical formal-
ism, we will show how GF captures the con-
straints presented in section 3.6. The examples
include the following GF constructors: mkText
(Text), mkPhr (Phrase), mkS (Sentence), mkCl
(Clause), mkNP (Noun Phrase), mkVP (Verb
Phrase), mkAdv (Verb Phrase modifying ad-
verb), passiveVP (Passive Verb Phrase), mkN
(Noun).

The above extracts from the concrete mod-
ules follow the observed organization prin-
ciples concerning the order of semantic in-
formation in a discourse and the generation
of language-dependent referential chains (pre-
sented in the right-hand column of table 4). In
these extracts, variations in referential forms
are captured in the noun phrase of str2. In the
English module, the paintingtype that is the di-
rect hypernym of the painting object is coded,
while in the Swedish module, a synonym word
of the painting concept is coded, e.g tavla. In
the Hebrew module, a higher concept in the hi-
erarchy of paintings, artwork_N.s is coded.
4.3 Experiments and results
A preliminary evaluation was conducted to test
how significant is the approach of adapting
language-dependent coreference strategies to
produce coherent descriptions. Nine human
subjects participated in the evaluation, three
native speakers of each language.
The subjects were given forty object descrip-
tion pairs. One description containing only
pronouns as the type of referring expressions
and one description that was automatically
generated by applying the language dependent
coreference strategies. Examples of the descrip-
tion pairs the subjects were asked to evaluate
are given in table 4. We asked the subjects to
choose the description they find most coherent
based on their intuitive judgements. Partici-
pant agreement was measured using the kappa
statistic (Fleiss, 1971). The results of the evalu-
ation are reported in table 5.
Pronouns Pronouns/NPs K

Table 5: A summary of the human evaluation.
On average, the evaluators approved at least
half of the automatically generated descrip-
tions, with a considerably good agreement. A
closer look at the examples where chains of pro-
nouns were preferred revealed that these oc-
curred in English when a description consisted
of two or three sentences and the second and
third sentences specified the painting dimen-
sions or a date. In Swedish, these were pre-
ferred whenever a description consisted of two
sentences. In Hebrew, the evaluators preferred
a description containing a pronoun over a de-
scription containing the higher hypernym Man-
made object, and also preferred the pronoun
when a description consisted of two sentences,

5 Conclusions and future work
This paper has presented a cross-linguistic
study and demonstrated some differences
in how coreference is expressed in English,
Swedish and Hebrew. As a result of the in-
vestigation, a set of language-specific coref-
erence strategies were identified and imple-
mented in GF. This multilingual grammar was
used to generate object descriptions which
were then evaluated by native speakers of each
language. The evaluation results, although per-
formed with a small number of descriptions
and human evaluators, indicate that language-
dependent coreference strategies lead to better
output. Although the data used to compare
the co-referential chains was restricted in size, it
was sufficient to determine several differences
between the languages for the given domain.
Future work aims to extend the grammar to
cover more ontology statements and discourse
patterns. We will consider conjunctions and el-
lipsis in these patterns. We intend to formalize
and generalize the strategies presented in this
paper and test whether there exist universal co-
referential chains, which might result in coher-
ent descriptions in more than three languages.
