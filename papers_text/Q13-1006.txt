Abstract
Unsupervised parsing is a difficult task that
infants readily perform. Progress has been
made on this task using text-based models, but
few computational approaches have considered
how infants might benefit from acoustic cues.
This paper explores the hypothesis that word
duration can help with learning syntax. We de-
scribe how duration information can be incor-
porated into an unsupervised Bayesian depen-
dency parser whose only other source of infor-
mation is the words themselves (without punc-
tuation or parts of speech). Our results, evalu-
ated on both adult-directed and child-directed
utterances, show that using word duration can
improve parse quality relative to words-only
baselines. These results support the idea that
acoustic cues provide useful evidence about
syntactic structure for language-learning in-
fants, and motivate the use of word duration
cues in NLP tasks with speech.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised learning of syntax is difficult for NLP
systems, yet infants perform this task routinely. Pre-
vious work in NLP has focused on using the implicit
syntactic information available in part-of-speech
(POS) tags (Klein and Manning, 2004), punctuation
(Seginer, 2007; Spitkovsky et al, 2011b; Ponvert et
al., 2011), and syntactic similarities between related
languages (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Cohen et al,
2011). However, these approaches likely use the data
in a very different way from children: neither POS
tags nor punctuation are observed during language
acquisition (although see Spitkovsky et al (2011a)
and Christodoulopoulos et al (2012) for encourag-
ing results using unsupervised POS tags), and many
children learn in a broadly monolingual environment.
This paper explores a possible source of information
that NLP systems typically ignore: word duration, or
the length of time taken to pronounce each word.
There are good reasons to think that word dura-
tion might be useful for learning syntax. First, the
well-established Prosodic Bootstrapping hypothesis
(Gleitman and Wanner, 1982) proposes that infants
use acoustic-prosodic cues (such as word duration)
to help them identify syntactic structure, because
prosodic and syntactic structures sometimes coincide.
More recently, we proposed (Pate and Goldwater,
2011) that infants might use word duration as a di-
rect cue to syntactic structure (i.e., without requir-
ing intermediate prosodic structure), because words
in high-probability syntactic structures tend to be
pronounced more quickly (Gahl and Garnsey, 2004;
Gahl et al, 2006; Tily et al, 2009).
Like most recent work on unsupervised parsing,
we focus on learning syntactic dependencies. Our
work is based on Headden et al (2009)?s Bayesian
version of the Dependency Model with Valence
(DMV) (Klein and Manning, 2004), using interpo-
lated backoff techniques to incorporate multiple infor-
mation sources per token. However, whereas Head-
den et al used words and POS tags as input, we
use words and word duration information, presenting
three variants of their model that use this information
in slightly different ways.1
1By using neither gold-standard nor learned POS tags as
input, our work differs from nearly all previous work on unsuper-
vised dependency parsing. While learned tags might be plausible
63
To our knowledge, this is the first work to incor-
porate acoustic cues into an unsupervised system for
learning full syntactic parses. The methods in this
paper were inspired by our previous approach (Pate
and Goldwater, 2011), which showed that word dura-
tion measurements could improve the performance
of an unsupervised lexicalized syntactic chunker over
a words-only baseline. However, that work was lim-
ited to HMM-like sequence models, tested on adult-
directed speech (ADS) only, and none of the models
outperformed uniform-branching baselines. Here, we
extend our results to full dependency parsing, and
experiment on transcripts of both spontaneous ADS
and child-directed speech (CDS). Our models us-
ing word duration outperform words-only baselines,
along with the Common Cover Link parser of Seginer
(2007), and the Unsupervised Partial Parser of Pon-
vert et al (2011), unsupervised lexicalized parsers
that have obtained state-of-the-art results on standard
newswire treebanks (though their performance here
is worse, as our input lacks punctuation). We also
outperform uniform-branching baselines.
2 Syntax and Word Duration
Before presenting our models and experiments, we
first discuss why word duration might be a useful cue
to syntax. This section reviews the two possible rea-
sons mentioned above: duration as a cue to prosodic
structure, or as a cue to predictability.
2.1 Prosodic Bootstrapping
Prosody is the structure of speech as conveyed by
rhythm and intonation, which are, in turn, conveyed
by such measurable phenomena as variation in fun-
damental frequency, word duration, and spectral tilt.
Prosodic structure is typically analyzed as imposing
a shallow, hierarchical grouping structure on speech,
with the ends of prosodic phrases (constituents) be-
ing cued in part by lengthening the last word of the
phrase (Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986).
The Prosodic Bootstrapping hypothesis (Gleit-
man and Wanner, 1982) points out that prosodic
phrases are often also syntactic phrases, and proposes
that language-acquiring infants exploit this correla-
tion. Specifically, if infants can learn about prosodic
phrase structure using word duration (and fundamen-
in a model of language acquisition, gold tags certainly are not.
tal frequency), they may be able to identify syntactic
phrases more easily using word strings and prosodic
trees than using word strings alone.
Several behavioral experiments support the con-
nection between prosody and syntax and the prosodic
bootstrapping hypothesis specifically. For example,
there is evidence that adults use prosodic information
for syntactic disambiguation (Millotte et al, 2007;
Price et al, 1991) and to help in learning the syntax
of an artificial language (Morgan et al, 1987), while
infants can use acoustic-prosodic cues for utterance-
internal clause segmentation (Seidl, 2007).
On the computational side, we are aware of only
our previous HMM-based chunkers (Pate and Gold-
water, 2011), which learned shallow syntax from
words, words and word durations, or words and hand-
annotated prosody. Using these chunkers, we found
that using words plus prosodic annotation worked
better than just words, and words plus word duration
worked even better. While these results are consistent
with the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis, we sug-
gested that predictability bootstrapping (see below)
might be a more plausible explanation.
Other computational work has combined prosody
with syntax, but only in supervised systems, and typi-
cally using hand-annotated prosodic information. For
example, Huang and Harper (2010) used annotated
prosodic breaks as a kind of punctuation in a su-
pervised PCFG, while prosodic breaks learned in a
semi-supervised way have been used as features for
parse reranking (Kahn et al, 2005) or PCFG state-
splitting (Dreyer and Shafran, 2007). In contrast to
these methods, our approach observes neither parse
trees nor prosodic annotations.
2.2 Predictability Bootstrapping
On the basis of our HMM chunkers, we introduced
the predictability bootstrapping hypothesis (Pate and
Goldwater, 2011): the idea that word durations could
be a useful cue to syntactic structure not (or not only)
because they provide information about prosodic
structure, but because they are a direct cue to syntac-
tic predictability. It is well-established that talkers
tend to pronounce words more quickly when they
are more predictable, as measured by, e.g., word
frequency, n-gram probability, or whether or not the
word has been previously mentioned (Aylett and Turk,
2004; Bell et al, 2009). However, syntactic proba-
64

bility also seems to matter, with studies showing that
verbs tend to be pronounced more quickly when they
are in their preferred syntactic frame?transitive vs.
intransitive or direct object vs. sentential comple-
ment (Gahl and Garnsey, 2004; Gahl et al, 2006;
Tily et al, 2009). While this syntactic evidence is
only for verbs, together with the evidence that effects
of other notions of predictability, it suggests that such
syntactic effects may also be widespread. If so, the
duration of a word could give clues as to whether it
is being used in a high-probability or low-probability
structure, and thus what the correct structure is.
We found that our syntactic chunkers benefited
more from duration information than prosodic an-
notations, providing some preliminary evidence in
favor of predictability bootstrapping, but not ruling
out prosodic bootstrapping. So, we are left with two
plausible mechanisms by which word duration could
help with learning syntax. Slow pronunciations may
cue the end of a prosodic phrase, which is sometimes
also the end of a syntactic phrase. Alternatively, slow
pronunciations may indicate that the hidden syntactic
structure is low probability, facilitating the induc-
tion of a probabilistic grammar. This paper will not
seek to determine which mechanism is useful, instead
taking the presence of two possible mechanisms as
encouraging for the prospect of incorporating word
duration into unsupervised parsing.
3 Models2
As mentioned, we will be incorporating word dura-
tion into unsupervised dependency parsing, produc-
ing analyses like the one in Figure 1. Each arc is
between two words, with the head at the non-arrow
end of the arc, and the dependent at the arrow end.
One word, the root, depends on no word, and all
other words depend on exactly one word. Following
previous work on unsupervised dependency parsing,
we will not label the arcs.
2The implementation of these models is available at
http://github.com/jpate/predictabilityParsing
3.1 Dependency Model with Valence
All of our models are ultimately based on the De-
pendency Model with Valence (DMV) of Klein and
Manning (2004), a generative, probabilistic model
for projective (i.e. no crossing arcs), unlabeled de-
pendency parses, such as the one in Figure 1.
The DMV generates dependency parses using
three probability distributions, which together com-
prise model parameters ?. First, the root of the
sentence is drawn from Proot . Second, we decide
whether to stop generating dependents of the head
h in direction dir ? {left, right} with probability
Pstop(?|h, dir , v), where v is T if h has a dir-ward
dependent and F otherwise. If we decide to stop,
then h takes no more dependents in the direction of
dir. If we don?t stop, we use the third probability
distribution Pchoose(d|h, dir) to determine which de-
pendent d to generate. The second and third step
repeat for each generated word until all words have
stopped generating in both directions.
The DMV was the first unsupervised parsing
model to outperform a uniform-branching baseline
on the Wall Street Journal corpus. It was trained
using EM to obtain a maximum-likelihood estimate
of the parameters ?, and learned from POS tags to
avoid rare events. However, all work on syntactic
predictability effects on word duration has been lexi-
calized (looking at, e.g., the transitivity bias of par-
ticular verbs). In addition, it is unlikely that children
have access to the correct parts of speech when first
learning syntactic structure. Thus, we want a DMV
variant that learns from words rather than POS tags.
We therefore adopt several extensions to the DMV
due to Headden et al (2009), described next.
3.2 The DMV with Backoff
Headden et al (2009) sought to improve the DMV by
incorporating lexical information in addition to POS
tags. However, arcs between particular words are
rare, so they modified the DMV in two ways to deal
with this sparsity. First, they switched from MLE to a
Bayesian approach, estimating a probability distribu-
tion over model parameters ? and dependency trees
T given the training corpus C and a prior distribution
? over models: P (T, ?|C,?).
Headden et al avoided overestimating the proba-
bility of rare events that happen to occur in the train-
65
ing data by picking ? to assign low probability to
models ? which give high probability to rare events.
Accordingly, models that overcommit to rare events
will contribute little to the final average over models.
Specifically, Headden et al use Dirichlet priors, with
? being the Dirichlet hyperparameters.
Headden et al?s second innovation was to adapt in-
terpolated backoff methods from language modeling
with n-grams, where one can estimate the probabil-
ity of word wn given word wn?1 by interpolating
between unigram and bigram probability estimates:
P? (wn|wn?1) = ?P (wn|wn?1) + (1? ?)P (wn)
with ? ? [0, 1]. Ideally, ? should be large whenwn?1
is frequent, and small when wn?1 is rare. Headden et
al. (2009) apply this method to the DMV by backing
off from Choose and Stop distributions that condition
on both head word and POS to distributions that
condition on only the head POS.
In the equation above, ? is a scalar parameter.
However, it actually specifies a probability distri-
bution over the decision to back off (B) or not back
off (?B), and we can use different notation to reflect
this view. Specifically, ?stop(?) and ?choose(?) will
represent our backoff distributions for the Stop and
Choose decision, respectively. Using hp and dp to
represent head and dependent POS tag and hw and
dw to represent head and dependent word, one of the
models Headden et al explored estimates:
P? choose(dp|hw, hp, dir , val) =
?choose(?B|hw, hp, dir)Pchoose(dp|hw, hp, dir)
+?choose(B|hw, hp, dir)Pchoose(dp|hp, dir) (1)
with an analogous backoff for Pstop . We can see
from Equation 1 that P?choose backs off from a dis-
tribution that conditions on hw to a distribution that
marginalizes out hw, and that the extent of backoff
varies across hw; we can use this to back off more
when we have less evidence about hw. This model
only conditions on words; it does not generate them
in the dependents. This means it is actually a condi-
tional, rather than fully generative, model of observed
POS tags and unobserved syntax conditioned on the
observed words.
Since identifying the true posterior distribution
P (T, ?|C,?) is intractable, Headden et al use Mean-
field Variational Bayes (Kurihara and Sato, 2006;
Johnson, 2007), which finds an approximation to the
posterior using an iterative EM-like algorithm. In the
E-step of VBEM, expected countsE(ri) are gathered
for each latent variable using the Inside-Outside algo-
rithm, exactly as in the E-step of traditional EM. The
Maximization step differs from the M-Step of EM in
two ways. First, the expected counts for each value
of the latent variable ri are incremented by the hy-
perparameter ?i. Second, the numerator and denom-
inator are scaled by the function exp(?(?)), which
reduces the probability of rare events. Specifically,
the Pchoose distribution is estimated using expecta-
tions for each arc adp,h,dir from head h to dependent
POS tag dp in direction dir, and the update equation
for Pchoose from iteration n to n+ 1 is:
P?n+1choose(dp|h, dir) =
exp(?(En(adp,h,dir ) + ?dp,h,dir ))
exp(?(
?
c(En(ac,h,dir ) + ?c,h,dir )))
(2)
where h is the head POS tag for the backoff distri-
bution, and the head (word, POS) pair for the no
backoff distribution. The update equation for Pstop
is analogous.
Now consider the update equations for ?choose :
??n+1choose(?B|hw, hp, dir) =
exp(?(??B +
?
c(En(ac,hw,hp,dir ))))
exp(?(?B + ??B +
?
c(En(ac,hw,hp,dir ))))
??n+1choose(B|hw, hp, dir) =
exp(?(?B))
exp(?(?B + ??B +
?
c(En(ac,hw,hp,dir ))))
Only the ?B numerator includes the expected counts,
so as we see hw in direction dir more often, the ?B
numerator will swamp the B numerator. By picking
?B larger than ??B, we can bias our ? distribution to
prefer backing off until we expect at least ?B ? ??B
arcs out of hw with tag hp in the direction of dir.
To obtain good performance, Headden et al re-
placed each word that appeared fewer than 100 times
in the training data with the token ?UNK.? We will
also use such an UNK cutoff.
3.3 DMV with Duration
We explore three models. One is a straightforward
application of the DMV with Backoff to words and
66
(quantized) word duration, and the other two are fully-
generative variants. We also consider using words
and POS tags as input to these models. Backoff mod-
els are given two streams of information, providing
two of word identity, POS tag, or word duration for
each observed token. We call one stream the ?back-
off? stream, and the other the ?extra? stream. Backoff
models learn a probability distribution conditioning
on both streams, backing off to condition on only the
backoff stream.
Our first words and duration model takes the du-
ration as the extra stream and the word identity as
the backoff stream, and, using ha to represent the
acoustic information for the head, defines:
P? choose(dw|hw, ha, dir) =
?choose(?B|hw, ha, dir)Pchoose(dw|hw, ha, dir)
+?choose(B|hw, ha, dir)Pchoose(dw|hw, dir) (3)
with an analogous backoff scheme for Pstop . We will
refer to this conditional model as ?Cond.? in our
experiments. This equation is similar to Equation 1,
except it uses words and duration instead of words
and POS tags, and backs off to, not away from, words.
We back off to the sparse words, rather than the less
sparse duration, because duration provides almost no
information about syntax in isolation.3
Directly modelling the extra stream among the
dependents may allow us to capture selectional re-
strictions in POS and words models, or exploit ef-
fects of syntactic predictability on dependent dura-
tion. We therefore explore variants that generate both
streams in the dependents. First, we examine a model
(?Joint?) that generates them jointly:
P?choose(dw, da|hw, hp, dir) =
?choose(?B|hw, ha, dir)
Pchoose(dw, da|hw, ha, dir)
+?choose(B|hw, ha, dir)
Pchoose(dw, da|hw, dir) (4)
However, this joint model will have a very large state-
space and may suffer from the same data sparsity, so
we also explore a model (?Indep.?) that generates the
3Preliminary dev-set experiments confirmed this intuition, as
models that backed off to word duration performed poorly.
extra and backoff independently:
P?choose(dw, da|hw, hp, dir) =
?choose(?B|hw, ha, dir)
Pchoose backoff (dw|hw, ha, dir)
Pchoose extra(da|hw, ha, dir)
+ ?choose(B|hw, ha, dir)
Pchoose backoff (dw|hw, dir)
Pchoose extra(da|hw, dir) (5)
We also modified the DMV with Backoff to handle
heavily lexicalized models. In Headden et al (2009),
arcs between words that never appear in the same
sentence are given probability mass only by virtue
of the backoff distribution to POS tags, which all
appear in the same sentence at least once. We want to
avoid relying on POS tags, and we also want to use
held-out development and test sets to avoid implicitly
overfitting the data when exploring different model
structures. To this end, we add one extra ?UNK hyper-
parameter to the Dirichlet prior of Pchoose for each
combination of conditioning events. This hyperpa-
rameter reserves probability mass for a head h to take
a word dw as a dependent if h and dw never appeared
together in the training data. The amount of probabil-
ity mass reserved decreases as we see hw more often.
This is implemented in training by adding ?UNK to
the denominator of the Pchoose update equation for
each h and dir. At test time, if a word dw appears
as an unseen dependent for head h, h takes dw as a
dependent with probability:
P? choose(dw|h, dir) = (6)
exp(?(?UNK))
exp(?(?UNK +
?
c(Elast(rc,h,dir ) + ?c,h,dir )))
Here, h may be a word, (word, POS) pair, or (word,
duration) pair. Since this event by definition never
occurs in the training data, ?UNK does not appear in
the numerator during training. 4
Finally, the conditional model ignores the extra
stream in Proot , and the generative models estimate
4Note also that ?UNK is different from a global UNK cutoff,
which is imposed in preprocessing, and so effects every occur-
rence of an an UNK?d word in the model. ?UNK affects only
dependents in Pchoose , and treats a dependent as UNK iff it did
not occur on that particular side of that particular head word in
any sentence. We used both global UNK cutoffs (optimized on
the dev set) and these ?UNK hyperparameters.

4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Datasets
We evaluate on three datasets: wsj10, sentences of
length 10 or less from the Wall Street Journal por-
tion of the Penn Treebank; swbdnxt10, sentences
of length 10 or less from the Switchboard dataset
of ADS used by Pate and Goldwater (2011); and
brent, part of the Brent corpus of CDS (Brent and
Siskind, 2001). Table 1 presents corpus statistics.
4.1.1 wsj10
We present a new evaluation of the DMV with
Backoff on wsj10, which does not have any acous-
tic information, simply to verify that ?UNK performs
sensibly on a standard corpus. Additionally, Headden
et al (2009) use an intensive initializer that relies on
dozens of random restarts, and so, strictly speaking,
only show that the backoff technology is useful for
good initializations. Our new evaluation will show
that the backoff technology provides a substantial
benefit even for harmonic initialization.
wsj10 was created in the standard way; all punc-
tuation and traces were removed, and sentences con-
taining more than ten tokens were discarded. For
our fully lexicalized version of wsj10, all words
were lowercased, and numbers were replaced with
the token ?NUMBER.?5 Following standard practice,
we used sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for
development, and section 23 for test. wsj10 con-
tains hand-annotated constituency parses, not depen-
dency parses, so we used the standard ?constituency-

to-dependency? conversion tool of Johansson and
Nugues (2007) to obtain high-quality CoNLL-style
dependency parses.
4.1.2 swbdnxt10
Next, we evaluate on swbdnxt10, which con-
tains all sentences up to length 10 from the same
sections of the swbdnxt version of Switchboard
used by Pate and Goldwater (2011). Short sentences
are usually formulaic discourse responses (e.g. ?oh
ok?), so this dataset alo excludes sentences shorter
than three words. As our models successfully use
word durations, this evaluation provides an important
replication of the basic result from Pate and Goldwa-
ter (2011) with a different kind of syntactic model.
swbdnxt10 has a forced alignment of a
dictionary-based phonetic transcription of each ut-
terance to audio, providing our word duration infor-
mation. As a very simple model of hyper-articulation
and hypo-articulation, we classify a word as in the
longest third duration, shortest third, or middle third.
To minimize effects of word form, this classification
was based on vowel count (counting a diphthong as
one vowel): each word with n vowels is classified as
in the shortest, longest, or middle tercile of duration
among words with n vowels.
Like wsj10, swbdnxt10 is annotated only
with constituency parses, so to provide approximate
?gold-standard? dependencies, we used the same
constituency-to-dependency conversion tool as for
wsj10. We evaluated 200 randomly-selected sen-
tences to check the accuracy of the conversion tool,
which was designed for newspaper text. Excluding
arcs involving words with no clear role in depen-
dency structure (such as ?um?), about 86% of the
arcs were correct. While this rate is uncomfortably
low, it is still much higher than unsupervised depen-
dency parsers typically achieve, and so may provide
a reasonable measure of relative dependency parse
quality among competing systems.
4.1.3 brent
We also evaluated our models on the ?Large Brent?
dataset introduced in Rytting et al (2010), a por-
tion of the Brent corpus of child-directed speech
(Brent and Siskind, 2001). We call this corpus
brent. It consists of utterances from four of the
mothers in Brent and Siskind?s (2001) study, and, like
68
swbdnxt10, has a forced alignment from which we
obtain duration terciles. Rytting et al (2010) used
a 90%/10% train/test partition. We extracted every
ninth utterance from the original training partition to
create a dev set, producing an 80%/10%/10% parti-
tion. We also separated clitics from their base word.
This dataset only has 186 sentences longer than ten
words, with a maximum length of 22 words, so we
discarded only sentences shorter than three words
from the evaluation sets.
The Brent corpus is distributed via CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000) with automatic dependency an-
notations. However, these are not hand-corrected,
and rely on a different tokenization of the dataset
than is present on the transcription tier. To produce a
reliable gold-standard,6 we annotated all sentences of
length 2 or greater from the development and test sets
with dependencies drawn from the Stanford Typed
Dependency set (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)
using the annotation tool used for the Copenhagen
Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003).
4.2 Parameters
In all experiments, hyperparameters for Proot , Pstop ,
and Pchoose (and their backed-off distributions, and
including ?UNK) were 1, ?B was 10, and ??B was 1.
VBEM was run on the training set until the data
log-likelihood changed by less than 0.001%, and
then the parameters were held fixed and used to
obtain Viterbi parses for the evaluation sentences.
Finally, we explored different global UNK cutoffs,
replacing each word that appeared less than c times
with the token UNK. We ran each model for each
c ? {0, 1, 25, 50, 100}, and picked the best-scoring
c on the development set for running on the test set
and presentation here. We used a harmonic initializer
similar to the one in Klein and Manning (2004).
4.3 Evaluation
In addition to evaluating the various incarnations of
the DMV with backoff and input types, we compare
to uniform branching baselines, the Common Cover
Link (CCL) parser of Seginer (2007), and the Unsu-
pervised Partial Parser (UPP) of Ponvert et al (2011).
The UPP produces a constituency parse from words
and punctuation using a series of finite-state chun-
6Available at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0930006/brentDep/
kers; we use the best-performing (Probabilistic Right
Linear Grammar) version. The CCL parser produces
a constituency parse using a novel ?Cover Link? rep-
resentation, scoring these links heuristically. Both
CCL and UPP rely on punctuation (though according
to Ponvert et al (2011), UPP less so), which our in-
put is missing. The left-headed ?LH? (right-headed
?RH?) baseline assumes that each word takes the first
word to its right (left) as a dependent, and corre-
sponds to a uniform right-branching (left-branching)
constituency baseline.
We evaluate the output of all models in terms
of both constituency scores and dependency accu-
racy. Our wsj10 and swbdnxt10 corpora are
originally annotated for constituency structure, with
the dependency gold standard derived as described
above, while our brent corpus is originally anno-
tated for dependency structure, with the constituency
gold standard derived by defining a constituent to
span a head and each of its dependents (ignoring
any one-word ?constituents?). As the CCL and
UPP parsers don?t produce dependencies, only con-
stituency scores are provided.
For constituency scores, we present the standard
unlabeled Precision, Recall, and F-measure scores.
For dependency scores, we present Directed attach-
ment accuracy, Undirected attachment accuracy, and
the ?Neutral Edge Detection? (NED) score intro-
duced by Schwartz et al (2011). Directed attachment
accuracy counts an arc as a true positive if it correctly
identifies both a head and a dependent, whereas undi-
rected attachment accuracy ignores arc direction in
counting true positives. NED counts an arc as a true
positive if it would be a true positive under the Undi-

To assess statistical significance, we carried out
stratified shuffling tests, with 10, 000 random shuf-
fles, for all measures. Tables indicate significance

competitive baseline model on that measure, indi-
cated by an italic score. A star (?) indicates p < 0.05,
and a dagger (?) indicates p < 0.01. To see the di-
rection of a significant difference (i.e. whether the
backoff model is better or worse than the baseline),

5 Results
In all results, when a model sees only one kind of
information, that is expressed by writing out the ab-
breviation for the relevant stream: ?Wds? for words,
?POS? for Part-Of-Speech, ?Dur? for word duration.
For baseline models that see two streams, the abbre-
viations are joined by a ??? symbol (as they treat
input pairs as atoms drawn in the cross-product of the
two streams? vocabulary). For the backoff models,
the abbreviations are joined by a ?+? symbol (as they
combine the information sources with a weighted
sum), with the ?extra? stream name first.
5.1 Results: wsj10
The left half of Table 2 presents results on wsj10.
For the baseline models, the first column with hori-
zontal text indicates the input, while for the backoff
(Wds+POS) models, the first column with horizontal
text indicates whether and how the extra stream is
modeled in dependents (as described in Section 3.3).
The EM model with POS input is largely a repli-
cation of the original DMV, differing in the use of
separate train, dev, and test sets, and possibly the
details of the harmonic initializer. Our replication
achieves an undirected attachment score of 63.8 on
the test set, similar to the score of 64.5 reported by
Klein and Manning (2004) when training and evalu-
ating on all of wsj10. Cohen et al (2008) use the
same train/dev/test partition that we do, and report
a directed attachment score of 45.8, similar to our
directed attachment score of 46.4.
The VB model which learns from POS tags does
not outperform the EM model which learns from POS
tags, suggesting that data sparsity does not hurt the
DMV when using POS tags. As expected, the words-
only models perform much worse than both the POS
input models and the uniform LH baseline. VB does
improve the words-only constituency performance.
The Cond. and Indep. backoff models outperform
the POS-only baseline on all measures, but the Joint
backoff model does not demonstrate a clear advan-
tage over the POS-only baseline on any measure. The
success of the Indep. model indicates that modelling
dependent word identity does provide enough infor-
mation to justify the increase in sparsity. The failure
of the Joint model to provide a further improvement
indicates that the extra information in the full joint
over dependents does not justify the large increase
in parameters. We also see that several models out-
perform the LH baseline on dependencies, but the
advantage is much less in F-Score, underscoring the
loss of information in the conversion of dependen-
cies to constituencies. Finally, all models outperform
CCL and UPP on F-score, emphasizing their reliance
on the punctuation we removed.

5.2 Results: swbdnxt10
The right half of Table 2 presents performance fig-
ures on swbdnxt10 for input involving words and
POS tags. As expected, the EM and VB baselines
perform best when learning from gold-standard POS
tags, and we again see no benefit for the VB POS-
only model compared to the EM POS-only model.
The POS-only baselines far outperform the uniform-
attachment baselines on the dependency measures; to
our knowledge this is the first demonstration outside
the newspaper domain that the DMV outperforms a
uniform branching strategy on these measures.
The other comparisons among systems listed in
Table 2 are largely inconclusive. Models do com-
paratively well on either the constituency or depen-
dency evaluation, but not both. The backoff mod-
els outperform the baseline POS-only models in the
constituency evaluation, but underperform or match
those same models in the dependency evaluation.
Conversely, most models outperform the LH base-
line in the dependency evaluation, but not in the
constituency evaluation. There are probably two
causes for the ambiguity in these results. First, the
noise in the dependency gold-standard may have over-
whelmed any advantage from backoff. Second, as we
saw with wsj10, the conversion from dependencies
to constituencies removes information, which may
explain the failure of any model to outperform the
LH baseline in the constituency evaluation.
Table 3 presents performance figures on
swbdnxt10 for input involving words and duration,
including a scatter-plot of Undirected attachment
against constituency F-Score for the interesting
comparisons. In the scatter-plot, models up and
to the right performed better, and we see that the
negative correlation between the dependency and
constituency evaluations persists in words and dura-
tion input. VB substantially outperforms EM in the
baselines, indicating that good smoothing is helpful
when learning from words. Other comparisons
are again ambiguous; the dependency evaluation
is noisy, and backoff models outperform baseline
models on the constituency evaluation but not the
LH baseline. Still, the backoff models outperform
all words-only baselines in constituency score, with
two performing slightly worse in dependency score
and one performing much better. So there is some
evidence that word duration is useful, but we will
find clearer evidence on the brent corpus.
5.3 Results: brent
Table 4 presents results on the brent dataset. VB
is even more effective than in the other datasets for
improving performance among baseline models, lead-
ing to double-digit improvements on some measures.
Moreover, the best dev-set UNK cutoff drops to 1
for all VB models, indicating that, on this dataset,
VB provides good smoothing even in models without
backoff. This difference between datasets is likely
related to differences in vocabulary diversity; the

type:token ratio in the brent training set is about
1:15, compared to 1:5 and 1:9 in the wsj10 and
swbdnxt10 training sets, respectively.
More importantly for our main hypothesis, all
three backoff models using words and duration out-
perform the words-only baselines (including CCL
and UPP) on all dependency measures?the most
accurate measures on this corpus, which has hand-
annotated dependencies?and the Cond. model also
wins on F-score.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we showed how to use the DMV with
Backoff and two fully-generative variants to explore
the utility of word duration in fully lexicalized un-
supervised dependency parsing. Although other re-
searchers have incorporated features beyond words
and POS tags into DMV-like models (e.g., semantics:
Naseem and Barzilay (2011); morphology: Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al (2009)), we believe this is the first
example based on Headden et al (2009)?s backoff
method. As far as we know, our work is also the first
test of a DMV-based model on transcribed conver-
sational speech and the first to outperform uniform-
branching baselines without using either POS tags or
punctuation in the input. Our results show that fully-
lexicalized models can do well if they are smoothed
properly and exploit multiple cues.
Our experiments also suggest that CDS is espe-
cially easy to learn from. Model performance on
the brent dataset was generally higher than on
swbdnxt10, with a much lower UNK threshold.
This latter point, and the fact that brent has a much
lower word type/token ratio than the other datasets,
suggest that CDS provides more and clearer evidence
about words? syntactic behavior.
Finally, our results provide more evidence, using
a different, more powerful syntactic model than that
of Pate and Goldwater (2011), that word duration
is a useful cue for unsupervised parsing. We found
that several ways of incorporating duration were use-
ful, although the extra sparsity of Joint emissions
was not justified in any of our investigations. Our
results are consistent with both the prosodic and pre-
dictability bootstrapping hypotheses of language ac-
quisition, providing the first computational support
for these using a full syntactic parsing model and
tested on child-directed speech. While our models do
not provide a mechanistic account of how children
might use duration information to help with learning
syntax, they do show that this information is useful
in principle, even without any knowledge of latent
prosodic structure or its relationship to syntax. In ad-
dition, our results suggest it may be useful to explore
using word duration to enrich NLP tasks in speech-
related technologies, such as syntactically-inspired
language models for text-to-speech generation. In
the future, we also hope to investigate why duration
is helpful, designing experiments to tease apart the
role of prosody and predictability in learning syntax.
