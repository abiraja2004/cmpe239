Abstract
In this paper we investigate the rela-
tion between positive and negative pairs
in Textual Entailment (TE), in order to
highlight the role of contradiction in TE
datasets. We base our analysis on the de-
composition of Text-Hypothesis pairs into
monothematic pairs, i.e. pairs where only
one linguistic phenomenon at a time is re-
sponsible for entailment judgment and we
argue that such a deeper inspection of the
linguistic phenomena behind textual en-
tailment is necessary in order to highlight
the role of contradiction. We support our
analysis with a number of empirical ex-
periments, which use current available TE
systems.
1 Introduction
Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan et al, 2009) pro-
vides a powerful and general framework for ap-
plied semantics. TE has been exploited in a series
of evaluation campaigns (RTE - Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment) (Bentivogli et al, 2009), where
systems are asked to automatically judge whether
the meaning of a portion of text, referred as Text
(T), entails the meaning of another text, referred
as Hypothesis (H).
RTE datasets have been mainly built with the
purpose of showing the applicability of the TE
framework to different semantic applications in
Computational Linguistics. Starting from 2005,
[T,H] pairs were created including samples from
summarization, question answering, information
extraction, and other applications. This evaluation
provides useful cues for researchers and develop-
ers aiming at the integration of TE components in
larger applications (see, for instance, the use of a
TE engine for question answering in the QALL-
ME project system
1
, the use in relation extraction
(Romano et al, 2006), and in reading comprehen-
sion systems (Nielsen et al, 2009)).
Although the RTE evaluations showed pro-
gresses in TE technologies, we think that there is
still large room for improving qualitative analysis
of both the RTE datasets and the system results. In
particular, we intend to focus this paper on contra-
diction judgments and on a deep inspection of the
linguistic phenomena that determine such judg-
ments. More specifically, we address two distin-
guishing aspects of TE: (i) the variety of linguis-
tic phenomena that are relevant for contradiction
and how their distribution is represented in RTE
datasets; (ii) the fact that in TE it is not enough to
detect the polarity of a sentence, as in traditional
semantic analysis, but rather it is necessary to ana-
lyze the dependencies between two sentences (i.e.
the [T,H] pair) in order to establish whether a con-
tradiction holds between the pair. Under this re-
spect we are interested to investigate both how
polarity among Text and Hypothesis affects the
entailment/contradiction judgments and how dif-
ferent linguistic phenomena interact with polarity
(e.g. whether specific combinations of phenomena
are more frequent than others).
As an example, let us consider the pair:
T: Mexico?s new president, Felipe Calderon, seems to be
doing all the right things in cracking down on Mexico?s drug
traffickers.[...]
H: Felipe Calderon is the outgoing President of Mexico.
In order to detect the correct contradiction judg-
ment between T and H it is necessary to solve the
semantic inference that being the new President of
a country is not compatible with being the outgo-
ing President of the same country. This kind of
inference requires that (i) the semantic opposition
is detected, and that (ii) such opposition is consid-

Table 1: Application of the decomposition methodology to an original RTE pair
ered relevant for the contradiction judgment in the
specific context of the pair.
In order to address the issues above, we pro-
pose a methodology based on the decomposition
of [T,H] pairs into monothematic pairs, each rep-
resenting one single linguistic phenomenon rele-
vant for entailment judgment. Then, the analy-
sis is carried out both on the original [T,H] pair
and on the monothematic pairs originated from
it. In particular, we investigate the correlations on
positive and on negative pairs separately, and we
show that the strategies adopted by the TE sys-
tems to deal with phenomena contributing to the
entailment or to the contradiction judgment come
to light when analyzed using qualitative criteria.
We have experimented the decomposition method-
ology over a dataset of pairs, which either are
marked with a contradiction judgment, or show a
polarity phenomenon (either in T or H) which, al-
though present, is not relevant for cotradiction.
The final goal underlying our analysis of con-
tradiction in current RTE datasets is to discover
good strategies for systems to manage contradic-
tion and, more generally, entailment judgments.
To this aim, in Section 5 we propose a comparison
between two systems participating at the last RTE-
5 campaign and try to analyze their behaviour ac-
cording to the decomposition into monothematic
pairs.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
presents the main aspects related to contradiction
within the RTE context. Section 3 explains the
procedure for the creation of monothematic pairs
starting from RTE pairs. Section 4 describes the
experimental setup of our pilot study, as well as
the results of the qualitative analysis. Section 5
outlines the preliminary achievements in terms of
comparison of systems? strategies in order to man-
age contradiction. Finally, Section 6 reports on
previous work on contradiction and textual entail-
ment.
2 Contradiction and Textual Entailment
In RTE, two kinds of judgment are allowed: two
ways (yes or no entailment) or three way judg-
ment. In the latter, systems are required to decide
whether the hypothesis is entailed by the text (en-
tailment), contradicts the text (contradiction), or
is neither entailed by nor contradicts the text (un-
known). The RTE-4 and RTE-5 datasets are anno-
tated for a 3-way decision: entailment (50% of the
pairs), unknown (35%), contradiction (15%). This
distribution among the three entailment judgments
aims at reflecting the natural distribution of en-
tailment in a corpus, where the percentage of text
snippets neither entailing nor contradicting each
other is higher than the contradicting ones. Even if
this balance seems artificial since in a natural set-
ting the presence of unknown pairs is much higher
than the other two judgments (as demonstrated in
the Pilot Task proposed in RTE-5 (Bentivogli et
al., 2009)), the reason behind the choice of RTE
organizers is to maintain a trade-off between the
natural distribution of the data in real documents,
and the creation of a dataset balanced beween pos-
itive and negative examples (as in two way task).
As already pointed out in (Wang, 2009), the
similarity between T?s and H?s in pairs marked as
entailment and contradiction is much higher with
respect to the similarity between T?s and H?s in
pairs marked as unknown. To support this in-
tuition, (Bentivogli et al, 2009) provides some
data on the lexical overlap between T?s and H?s
in the last RTE Challenges. For instance, in RTE-
4 the lexical overlap is 68.95% in entailment pairs,
67.97% in contradiction pairs and only 57.36% in
87
the unknown pairs. Similarly, in RTE-5 the lexical
overlap between T?s and H?s is 77.14% in entail-
ment pairs, 78.93% in contradiction pairs and only
62.28% in the unknown pairs.
For this reason, for contradiction detection it is
not sufficient to highlight mismatching informa-
tion between sentences, but deeper comprehension
is required. For applications in information anal-
ysis, it can be very important to detect incompat-
ibility and discrepancies in the description of the
same event, and the contradiction judgment in the
TE task aims at covering this aspect. More specif-
ically, in the RTE task the contradiction judgment
is assigned to a T,H pair when the two text frag-
ments are extremely unlikely to be true simultane-
ously.
According to Marneffe et al (2008), contra-
dictions may arise from a number of different
constructions, defined in two primary categories:
i) those occurring via antonymy, negation, and
numeric mismatch, and ii) contradictions arising
from the use of factive or modal words, structural
and subtle lexical contrasts, and world knowledge.
Comparing the distribution of contradiction types
for RTE-3 and the real contradiction corpus they
created collecting contradiction ?in the wild? (e.g.
from newswire, Wikipedia), they noticed that in
the latter there is a much higher rate of negations,
numeric and lexical contradictions with respect
to RTE dataset, where contradictions of category
(ii) occur more frequently. Analyzing RTE data
of the previous challenges, we noticed that the
tendency towards longer and more complex
sentences in the datasets in order to reproduce
more realistic scenarios, is also reflected in more
complex structures determining contradictions.
For instance, contradictions arising from overt
negation as in (pair 1663, RTE-1 test set):
T: All residential areas in South Africa are segregated by
race and no black neighborhoods have been established in
Port Nolloth.
H: Black neighborhoods are located in Port Nolloth.
are infrequent in the datasets of more recent RTE
challenges. For instance, in RTE-5 test set, only in
4 out of 90 contradiction pairs an overt negation
is responsible for the contradiction judgment.
In agreement with (Marneffe et al, 2008), we
also remarked that most of the contradiction
involve numeric mismatch, wrong appositions,
entity mismatch and, above all, deeper inferences
depending on background and world knowledge,
as in (pair 567, RTE-5 test set):
T: ?[...] we?ve done a series of tests on Senator Kennedy
to determine the cause of his seizure. He has had no further
seizures, remains in good overall condition, and is up and
walking around the hospital?.
H: Ted Kennedy is dead.
These considerations do not mean that overt
negations do not appear in the RTE pairs. On the
contrary, they are often present in T,H pairs, but
most of the times their presence is irrelevant in the
assignment of the correct entailment judgment to
the pair. For instance, the scope of the negation
can be a phrase or a sentence with additional infor-
mation with respect to the relevant parts of T and
H that allow to correctly judge the pair. This fact
could be misleading for systems that do not cor-
recly exploit syntactic information, as the experi-
ments using Linear Distance described in (Cabrio
et al, 2008).
3 Decomposing RTE pairs
The qualitative evaluation we propose takes
advantage of previous work on monothematic
datasets. A monothematic pair (Magnini and
Cabrio, 2009) is defined as a [T,H] pair in which a
certain phenomenon relevant to the entailment re-
lation is highlighted and isolated. The main idea is
to create such monothematic pairs on the basis of
the phenomena which are actually present in the
original RTE pairs, so that the actual distribution
of the linguistic phenomena involved in the entail-
ment relation emerges.
For the decomposition procedure, we refer to
the methodology described in (Bentivogli et al,
2010), consisting of a number of steps carried
out manually. The starting point is a [T,H] pair
taken from one of the RTE datasets, that should be
decomposed in a number of monothematic pairs
[T,H
i
]
mono
, where T is the original Text and H
i
are the Hypotheses created for each linguistic phe-
nomenon relevant for judging the entailment rela-
tion in [T,H].
In detail, the procedure for the creation of
monothematic pairs is composed of the following
steps:
1. Individuate the linguistic phenomena which
contribute to the entailment in [T,H].
2. For each phenomenon i:
88
(a) Individuate a general entailment rule r
i
for the phenomenon i, and instantiate
the rule using the portion of T which ex-
presses i as the left hand side (LHS) of
the rule, and information from H on i as
the right hand side (RHS) of the rule.
(b) Substitute the portion of T that matches
the LHS of r
i
with the RHS of r
i
.
(c) Consider the result of the previous step
as H
i
, and compose the monothematic
pair [T,H
i
]
mono
. Mark the pair with
phenomenon i.
3. Assign an entailment judgment to each
monothematic pair.
Relevant linguistic phenomena are grouped us-
ing both fine-grained categories and broader cate-
gories. Macro categories are defined referring to
widely accepted linguistic categories in the liter-
ature (e.g. (Garoufi, 2007)) and to the inference
types typically addressed in RTE systems: lexical,
syntactic, lexical-syntactic, discourse and reason-
ing. Each macro category includes fine-grained
phenomena (Table 2 reports a list of some of the
phenomena detected in RTE-5 dataset).
Table 1 shows an example of the decomposi-
tion of a RTE pair (marked as contradiction) into
monothematic pairs. At step 1 of the methodology
both the phenomena that preserve the entailment
and the phenomena that break the entailment rules
causing a contradiction in the pair are detected,
i.e. argument realization, apposition and seman-
tic opposition (column phenomena in the table).
While the monothematic pairs created basing on
the first two phenomena preserve the entailment,
the semantic opposition generates a contradiction
(column judgment).
As an example, let?s apply step by step the
procedure to the phenomenon of semantic oppo-
sition. At step 2a of the methodology the general
rule:
Pattern: x ? / ? y
Constraint: semantic opposition(y,x)
is instantiated (new? / ?outgoing), and at step
2b the substitution in T is carried out (Mexico?s
outgoing president, Felipe Calderon [...]). At
step 2c a negative monothematic pair T,H
1
is
composed (column text snippet in the table) and
marked as semantic opposition (macro-category
lexical), and the pair is judged as contradiction.
In (Bentivogli et al, 2010), critical issues con-
cerning the application of such procedure are dis-
cussed in detail, and more examples are provided.
Furthermore, a pilot resource is created, composed
of a first dataset with 60 pairs from RTE-5 test
set (30 positive, and 30 negative randomly ex-
tracted examples), and a dataset composed of all
the monothematic pairs derived by the first one
following the procedure described before. The
second dataset is composed of 167 pairs (134 en-
tailment, 33 contradiction examples, considering
35 different linguistic phenomena).

4 Analysis and discussion
Our analysis has been carried out taking advan-
tage of the pilot resource created by Bentivogli
et al (2010). From their first dataset we ex-
tracted a sample of 48 pairs ([T,H]
sample?contr
)
composed of 30 contradiction pairs and 18 entail-
ment pairs, the latter containing either in T or in
H a directly or an indirectly licensed negation.
3
Furthermore, a dataset of 129 monothematic pairs
(96 entailment and 33 contradiction examples),
i.e. [T,H]
mono?contr
, was derived by the pairs
in [T,H]
sample?contr
applying the procedure de-
scribed in Section 3. The linguistic phenomena
isolated in the monothematic pairs (i.e. considered
relevant to correctly assign the entailment judg-
ment to our sample) are listed in Table 2.
In RTE datasets only a subpart of the potentially
problematic phenomena concerning negation and
negative polarity items is represented. At the same
time, the specificity of the task lies in the fact that
it is not enough to find the correct representation
of the linguistic phenomena underlying a sentence
meaning, but correct inferences should be derived
from the relations that these phenomena contribute
to establish between two text fragments. The
mere presence of a negation in T is not relevant
for the TE task, unless the scope of the negation (a
token or a phrase) is present as non-negated in H

Following (Harabagiu et al, 2006) overt (directly li-
censed) negations include i) overt negative markers such as
not, n?t; ii) negative quantifiers as no, and expressions such
as no one and nothing; iii) strong negative adverbs like never.
Indirectly licensed negations include: i) verbs or phrasal
verbs (e.g. deny, fail, refuse, keep from); ii) prepositions (e.g.
without, except); weak quantifiers (e.g. few, any, some), and
iv) traditional negative polarity items (e.g. a red cent or any-
more).

Table 2: Occurrences of linguistic phenomena in
TE contradiction pairs
(or viceversa), hence a contradiction is generated.
For this reason, 18 pairs of [T,H]
sample?contr
are judged as entailment even if a negation is
present, but it is not relevant to correctly assign
the entailment judgment to the pair as in (pair
205, RTE-5 test set):
T: A team of European and American astronomers say
that a recently discovered extrasolar planet, located not far
from Earth, contains oceans and rivers of hot solid water. The
team discovered the planet, Gliese 436 b [...].
H: Gliese 436 b was found by scientists from America and
Europe.
As showed in Table 2, only in one pair of
our sample the presence of a negation is relevant
to assign the contradiction judgment to the pair.
In the pairs we analyzed, contradiction mainly
arise from quantity mismatching, semantic oppo-
sition (antonymy), mismatching appositions (e.g.
the Swiss Foreign Minister x contradicts y is the
Swiss Foreign Minister), and from general infer-
ence (e.g. x became a naturalized citizen of the
U.S. contradicts x is born in the U.S.). Due to the
small sample we analyzed, some phenomena ap-
pear rarely, and their distribution can not be con-
sidered as representative of the same phenomenon
in a natural setting. In 27 out of 30 contradiction
pairs, only one monothematic pair among the ones
derived from each example was marked as con-
tradiction, meaning that on average only one lin-
guistic phenomenon is responsible for the contra-
diction judgment in a TE original pair. Hence the
importance of detecting it.
Given the list of the phenomena isolated in
[T,H]
mono?contr
with their frequency both in
monothematic positive pairs and monothematic
negative pairs, we derived the probability of lin-
guistic phenomena to contribute more to the as-
signment of a certain judgment than to another
(column probab. in Table 2). Such probability P
of a phenomenon i to appear in a positive (or in a
negative) pair is calculated as follows:
P (i|[T,H]
positive
) =
#(i|[T,H]
RTE5?positive?mono
)
#(i|[T,H]
RTE5?mono
)
(1)
For instance, if the phenomenon semantic op-
position appears in 3 pairs of our sample and all
these pairs are marked as contradiction, we as-
sign a probability of 1 to a pair containing a se-
mantic opposition to be marked as contradiction.
If the phenomenon apposition (syntax) appears in
9 monothematic positive pairs and in 6 negative
pairs, that phenomenon has a probability of 0.6 to
appear in positive examples and 0.4 to appear in
negative examples. Due to their nature, some phe-
nomena are strongly related to a certain judgment
(e.g. semantic opposition), while other can appear
both in positive and in negative pairs. Learning
such correlations on larger datasets could be an in-
teresting feature to be exploited by TE systems in
the assignment of a certain judgment if the phe-
nomenon i is detected in the pair.
Table 3 reports the cooccurrences of the linguis-
tic phenomena relevant to inference in the pairs
marked as contradiction. On the first horizontal
row all the phenomena that at least in one pair
determine contradiction are listed, while in the
first column there are all the phenomena cooc-
curring with them in the pairs. The idea un-
delying this table is to understand if it is possi-
ble to identify recurrent patterns of cooccurrences
between phenomena in contradiction pairs. As
can be noticed, almost all phenomena occur to-
gether with expressions requiring deeper inference

5 Comparing RTE systems? behaviour
on contradiction pairs
As introduced before, from a contradiction pair it
is possible to extract on average 3 monothematic
pairs (Bentivogli et al, 2009), and only one of
these monothematic pairs is marked as contradic-
tion. This means that on average only one lin-
guistic phenomenon is responsible for the contra-
diction judgment in a RTE pair, while the others
maintain the entailment relation (i.e. it is possible
to correcly apply an entailment rule as exemplified
in Section 3). On the contrary, in a pair judged
as entailment, all the monothematic pairs derived
from it are marked as entailment.
These observations point out the fact that if a
TE system is able to correctly isolate and judge
the phenomenon that generates the contradiction,
the system should be able to assign the correct
judgment to the original contradiction pair, despite
possible mistakes in handling the other phenom-
ena present in that pair.
In order to understand how it is possible to
take advantage of the data analyzed so far to
improve a TE system, we run two systems that
took part into the last RTE challenge (RTE-5) on
[T,H]
mono?contr
.
The first system we used is the EDITS system
(Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite) (Negri et
al., 2009)
4
, that assumes that the distance between
T and H is a characteristics that separates the pos-
itive pairs, for which entailment holds, from the
negative pairs, for which entailment does not hold
(it is developed according to the two way task). It
is based on edit distance algorithms, and computes
the [T,H] distance as the overall cost of the edit op-
erations (i.e. insertion, deletion and substitution)
that are required to transform T into H. In partic-
ular, we applied the model that produced EDITS
best run at RTE-5 (acc. on RTE-5 test set: 60.2%).
The main features of this run are: Tree Edit Dis-
tance algorithm on the parsed trees of T and H,
Wikipedia lexical entailment rules, and PSO opti-
mized operation costs, as described in (Mehdad et
al., 2009).
The other system used in our experiments
is VENSES
5
(Delmonte et al, 2009), that ob-
tained performances similar to EDITS at RTE-5
(acc. on test set: 61.5%). VENSES applies a
linguistically-based approach for semantic infer-
ence, composed of two main components: i) a
grammatically-driven subsystem that validates the
well-formedness of the predicate-argument struc-
ture and works on the output of a deep parser
producing augmented (i.e. fully indexed) head-
dependency structures; and ii) a subsystem that
detects allowed logical and lexical inferences bas-
ing on different kind of structural transformations
intended to produce a semantically valid mean-
ing correspondence. The system has a pronomi-
nal binding module that works at text/hypothesis
level separately for lexical personal, possessive
and reflexive pronouns, which are substituted by
the heads of their antecedents. Also in this case,
we applied the same configuration of the system
used in RTE evaluation.
Table 4 reports EDITS and VENSES accuracies
on the monothematic pairs of [T,H]
mono?contr
.
As said before, the accuracy reported for some
very rare phenomena cannot be considered com-
pletely reliable. Nevertheless, from these data the
main features of the systems can be identified. For
instance, EDITS obtains the highest accuracies on
the positive monothematic pairs, while it seems it
has no peculiar strategies to deal with phenomena

Table 4: RTE systems? accuracy on phenomena
that generally cause contradiction (e.g. seman-
tic opposition, negation, and quantity mismatch-
ing). On the contrary, VENSES shows an oppo-
site behaviour, obtaining the best results on the
negative cases. Analysing such data it is possible
to hypothesize systems? behaviours: for example,
on the monothematic dataset EDITS produces a
pretty high number of false positives, meaning that
for this system if there are no evidences of con-
tradiction, a pair should be marked as entailment
(in order to improve such system, strategies to de-
tect contradiction pairs should be thought). On the
contrary, VENSES produces a pretty high number
of false negatives, meaning that if the system is not
able to find evidences of entailment, it assigns the
contradiction value to the pairs (for this system,
being able to correctly detect all the phenomena
contributing to entailment in a pair is fundamen-
tal, otherwise it will be marked as contradiction).

Condoravdi et al (2003) first proposed contra-
diction detection as an important NLP task, then
(Harabagiu et al, 2006) provided the first em-
pirical results for it, focusing on contradiction
caused by negation, antonymy, and paraphrases.
Voorhees (2008) carries out an analysis of RTE-
3 extended task, examining systems? abilities to
detect contradiction and providing explanations
of their reasoning when making entailment deci-
sions.
Beside defining the categories of construction
from which contradiction may arise, Marneffe et
al. (2008) provide the annotation of the RTE
datasets (RTE-1 and RTE-2) for contradiction.
Furthermore, they also collect contradiction ?in
the wild? (e.g. from newswire, Wikipedia) to sam-
ple naturally occurring ones.

Ritter et al (2008) extend (Marneffe et al,
2008)?s analysis to a class of contradiction that can
only be detected using backgroud knowledge, and
describe a case study of contradiction detection
based on functional relations. They also automat-
ically generate a corpus of seeming contradiction
from the Web text.
7
Furthermore, some of the systems presented in
the previous editions of the RTE challenges at-
tempted specic strategies to focus on the phe-
nomenon of negation. For instance, (Snow et al,
2006) presents a framework for recognizing tex-
tual entailment that focuses on the use of syntactic
heuristics to recognize false entailment. Among
the others, heuristics concerning negation mis-
match and antonym match are defined. In (Tatu
et al, 2007) the logic representation of sentences
with negated concepts was altered to mark as
negated the entire scope of the negation. (Ferran-
dez et al, 2009) propose a system facing the en-
tailment recognition by computing shallow lexical
deductions and richer inferences based on seman-
tics, and features relating to negation are extracted.
In (Iftene et al, 2009) several rules are extracted
and applied to detect contradiction cases.
7 Conclusion
We have proposed a methodology for the qualita-
tive analysis of TE systems focusing on contradic-
tion judgments and on the linguistic phenomena
that determine such judgments. The methodology
is based on the decomposition of [T,H] pairs into
monothematic pairs, each representing one sin-
gle linguistic phenomenon relevant for entailment

judgment.
In particular, the phenomena from which con-
tradiction may arise and their distribution in RTE
datasets have been highlighted, and a pilot study
comparing the performancies of two RTE systems
both on monothematic pairs and on the corre-
sponding original ones has been carried out. We
discovered that, although the two systems have
similar performances in terms of accuracy on the
RTE-5 datasets, they show significant differences
in their respective abilities to correctly manage dif-
ferent linguistic phenomena that generally cause
contradiction. We hope that the analysis of con-
tradiction in current RTE datasets may bring inter-
esting elements to TE system developers to define
good strategies to manage contradiction and, more
generally, entailment judgments.
