Abstract 
We outline a set of key challenges for dialog 
management in physically situated interactive 
systems, and propose a core shift in perspec-
tive that places spoken dialog in the context of 
the larger collaborative challenge of managing 
parallel, coordinated actions in the open 
world.  
Multiple models for dialog management have been 
proposed, studied, and evaluated in the research 
community (i.a. Allen et al, 2001; Bohus and Rud-
nicky, 2009; Rich and Sidner, 1998; Traum and 
Larsson, 2003; Williams and Young, 2007). In the 
process, a diverse set of problems have come to 
light and have been pursued. These include the 
challenges of modeling initiative in interaction, 
contextual interpretation and processing, the man-
agement of uncertainty, grounding, error handling 
and recovery, turn-taking and, more recently, in-
cremental processing in dialog systems. Analyses 
of existing approaches (Allen et. al, 2001; Church-
er et. al, 1997; McTear 2002; Paek and Pieraccini, 
2008) reveal a constellation of benefits but also 
shortcomings along multiple dimensions, where no 
single technique provides the benefits of all. 
While taking incremental, focused steps is im-
portant for making progress within a mature disci-
pline, we believe that the current scope and 
conceptual borders of work in spoken dialog con-
strains thinking about possibilities and gets in the 
way of achieving breakthrough advances. Research 
to date on dialog management has focused almost 
exclusively on dyadic settings, where a single user 
interacts with a system over a relatively narrow, 
speech-only channel. Characteristics of this domi-
nant and shared worldview on dialog research have 
driven modeling and architectural choices, and of-
ten done so in an implicit, hidden manner. For in-
stance, dialog is often viewed as a collection of 
dialog moves that are timed in a relatively well-
structured, sequential fashion. As a consequence, 
dialog management models typically operate on a 
?per-turn? basis: inputs are assumed to arrive se-
quentially and are processed one at a time; for each 
received input, discourse understanding is per-
formed, and a corresponding response is generated.  
In reality, interactions among actors situated in 
the open, physical world depart deeply from com-
mon assumptions made in spoken dialog research 
and bring into focus an array of important, new 
challenges (Horvitz, 2007; Bohus and Horvitz, 
2010; Bohus, Horvitz, Kanda et al., eds., 2010).  
We describe some of the challenges with respect to 
dialog management, and re-frame this problem as 
an instance of the larger collaborative challenge of 
managing parallel, coordinated actions amidst a 
dynamically changing physical world.  
As an example, consider a robot that has been 
given the responsibility of greeting, interacting, 
and escorting visitors in a building. In this setting, 
reasoning about the actors, objects and events and 
relationships in the scene can play a critical role in 
understanding and organizing the interactions. The 
surrounding environment provides rich, continu-
ously streaming situational context that is relevant 
for determining the best way an agent might con-
tribute to interactions. Because the situational con-
text can evolve asynchronously with respect to 
turns in the conversation, systems that operate in 
the open world must be able to plan continuously, 
13
in stream, rather than on a ?per-turn? basis. Inter-
action and collaboration in these settings is best 
viewed as a flow of coordinated, parallel actions. 
The sequential structure of turns in dyadic interac-
tions is but one example of such coordination, fo-
cused solely on linguistic actions. However, to 
successfully interact and collaborate with multiple 
participants in physically situated settings, an agent 
must be able to recognize, plan, and produce both 
linguistic and non-linguistic actions, and reason 
about potentially complex patterns of coordination 
between actions, in-stream?as they are being pro-
duced by the participants in the collaboration. 
We argue that attaining the dream of fluid, 
seamless spoken language interaction with ma-
chines requires a fundamental shift in how we view 
dialog management. First, we need to move from 
per-turn to continual in-stream planning. Second, 
we need to move from reasoning about sequential 
actions to reasoning about parallel and coordinat-
ed actions and their influence on states in the 
world. And third, we need models that can track 
and leverage the streaming situational context, 
from noisy observations, to make decisions about 
how to best contribute to collaborations.  
Spoken dialog is an important channel for ex-
pressing coordinative information. However, we 
need to recognize and begin to tackle head on the 
larger challenge of situated collaborative activity 
management.  We understand that taking this per-
spective introduces new complexities?and that 
some of our colleagues will view diving into the 
larger problems in advance of solving simpler ones 
as being unwise. However, we believe that we 
must embrace the larger goals to make significant 
progress on the struggles with the simpler ones, 
and that the investment in solving challenges with 
physically situated collaboration will have eventual 
payoffs in enabling progress in spoken dialog.   
Making progress on the broader challenge re-
quires technical innovations, tools, and data. Con-
sider for instance one sub-problem of belief 
tracking in these systems: continuously updating 
beliefs over the state of the collaborative activity 
and the situational context requires the develop-
ment of new types of models that can combine 
streaming evidence about context collected 
through sensors, with discrete evidence about the 
actions performed or the turns spoken collected 
through speech, gesture or other action-recognition 
components. In addition, progress hinges on identi-
fying a set of relevant problem domains, and coor-
dinating efforts in the community to collect data, 
and comparatively evaluate proposed approaches. 
New tools geared towards analysis, visualization 
and debugging with streaming multimodal data are 
also required.   
We propose a core shift of perspective and as-
sociated research agenda for moving from dialog 
management to situated collaborative activity 
management. We invite discussion on these ideas.
