Abstract
In recent years microblogs have taken on an
important role in the marketing sphere, in
which they have been used for sharing opin-
ions and/or experiences about a product or ser-
vice. Companies and researchers have become
interested in analysing the content generated
over the most popular of these, the Twitter
platform, to harvest information critical for
their online reputation management (ORM).
Critical to this task is the efficient and accurate
identification of tweets which refer to a com-
pany distinguishing them from those which do
not. The aim of this work is to present and
compare two different approaches to achieve
this. The obtained results are promising while
at the same time highlighting the difficulty of
this task.
1 Introduction
Twitter1 - a microblog of the Web 2.0 genre that al-
lows users to publish brief message updates - has
become an important channel through which users
can share their experiences or opinions about a prod-
uct, service or company. In general, companies have
taken advantage of this medium for developing mar-
keting strategies.
Online reputation management - the monitoring
of media and the detection and analysis of opinions
about an entity - is becoming an important area of
research as companies need up to the minute infor-
mation on what is being send on the WWW about
them and their products. Being unaware of negative
1http://twitter.com
comments regarding a company may affect its repu-
tation and misguide consumers into not buying par-
ticular products. On the other hand companies may
identify user feedback and use it in order to provide
better products and services which could make them
more competitive.
A first step in this process is the automatic col-
lection of tweets relating to a company. In this pa-
per we present an approach to the categorisation of
tweets which contain a company name, into two
clusters corresponding to those which refer to the
company and those which do not. Clearly this is not
as straightforward as matching keywords due to the
potential for ambiguity. Providing a solution to this
problem will allow companies to access to the im-
mediate user reaction to their products or services,
and thereby manage their reputations more effec-
tively (Milstein et al, 2008).
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the problem and the related work.
Section 3 presents the data set used in the experi-
ments. Section 4 explains the approaches used in
this research work. Section 5 shows the experi-
ments, the obtained results and a discussion of them.
Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions.
2 Problem Description and Related Work
We are interested in discriminating between Twit-
ter entries that correspond to a company from those
that do not, in particular where the company name
also has a separate meaning in the English language
(e.g. delta, palm, ford, borders). In this research
work, we regard a company name as ambiguous if
the word/s that comprise its name can be used in
146
different contexts. An example can be seen in Ta-
ble 1 where the word borders is used in the con-
text of a company (row 1 & 3) and as the bound-
ary of a country (row 2). We adapt a clustering ap-
proach to solving this problem although the size of
tweets presents a considerable challenge. Moreover
the small vocabulary size in conjunction with the
writing style makes the task more difficult. Tweets
are written in an informal style, and may also con-
tain misspellings or be grammatically incorrect. In
order to improve the representation of the tweets we
have proposed two approaches based on an expan-
sion procedure (enriching semantic similarity hid-
den behind the lexical structure). In this research

work we demonstrate that a term expansion method-
ology, as presented in this paper, can improve the
representation of the microblogs from a clustering
perspective, and as a consequence the performance
of the clustering task. In addition, we test the hy-
pothesis that specific company names - names that
can not be found in a dictionary - such as Lennar or
Warner may be more easily identified than generic
company names such as Borders, Palm or Delta,
because of the ambiguity of the latter.
We describe briefly here the work related to the
problem of clustering short texts related to compa-
nies. In particular those works in the field of cate-
gorisation of tweets and clustering of short texts.
In (Sankaranarayanan et al, 2009) an approach is
presented for binary classification of tweets (class
?breaking news? or other). The class ?breaking
news? is then clustered in order to find the most
similar news tweets, and finally a location of the
news for each cluster is provided. Tweets are con-
sidered short texts as mentioned in (Sriram et al,
2010) where a proposal for classifying tweets is pre-
sented. This work addressed the problem by using a
small set of domain-specific features extracted from
the author?s profile and the tweet text itself. They
claim to effectively classify the tweet to a predefined
set of generic classes such as News, Events, Opin-
ions, Deals, and Private Messages. Therefore, it is
important to analyse some techniques for categori-
sation of short texts.
The main body of relevant related research em-
anates from the WePS-3 evaluation campaign in
the task 2 called Online Reputation Management
(Amigo? et al, 2010). In (Garc??a-Cumbreras et al,
2010) the authors based their approach on recog-
nising named entities, extracting external informa-
tion and predefining rules. They use the well-known
Name Entity Recogniser (NER) included in GATE2
for recognising all the entities in their Tweets. They
also use the web page of the organisation, Wikipedia
and DBpedia3. Predefined rules are then applied to
determine if a Twitter entry belongs to an organisa-
tion or not.
The work presented in (Kalmar, 2010) uses data
from the company website. This data is used to cre-
ate a initial model from which to bootstrap a model
from the Tweets, the keywords and description are
weighted. The features used are the co-occurring
words in each tweet and the relevance of them was
calculated according to the Pointwise Mutual Infor-
mation value. Although it seems to be an interesting
approach the results shown are disappointing.
In (Yerva et al, 2010) a support vector machine
(SVM) classifier is used with the profiles built a
priori. Profiles are constructed for each company
which are sets of keywords that are related to the
company or sets of keywords unrelated to the com-
pany. This system uses external resources such as
Wordnet4, meta-data from the company web page,
GoogleSet5 and user feedback. The research pre-
sented in (Yoshida et al, 2010) propose that organi-
sation names can be classified as ?organization-line
names? or ?general-word-like names?. The authors
have observed that the fact that ratio of positive or
negative (if the tweet is related to the organisation or
not) has a strong correlation with the types of organ-
isation names i.e., ?organization-like names? have
high percentages of tweets related to the company

147
and when compared to ?general-word-like names?
Another approach is described in (Tsagkias and Ba-
log, 2010), in which the authors trained the well-
known J48 decision tree classifier using as features
the company name, content value such as the pres-
ence of URLs, hashtags or is-part-of-a-conversation,
content quality such as ratio of punctuation and cap-
ital characters and organisational context. This ap-
proach is quite interesting but they require a training
set.

The corpus was obtained from the trial and train-
ing data sets of this evaluation campaign. The trial
corpus of task 2 contains entries for 17 (English)
6WePS3: searching information about entities in the Web,
http://nlp.uned.es/weps/, February 2010
and 6 (Spanish) organisations; whereas the train-
ing data set contains 52 (English) organisations. The
corpus was labelled by five annotators: the true la-
bel means that the tweet is associated to a company,
whereas the false one means that the tweet is not
related to any company, and the unknown label is
used where the annotators were unable to make a
decision.
In order to gauge the problem and to estab-
lish a baseline for the potential of a clustering ap-
proach. We decided to cluster the data sets (trial
and training) using the K-means algorithm (Mac-
Queen, 1967) with k equal to three in order to have
a clear reference and detect possible drawbacks that
the collections may contain. The results were eval-
uated using the F-measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979)
and gave values of 0.52 and 0.53 for the trial and
training data sets respectively. This was expected, as
clustering approaches typically work best with long
documents and balanced groups (Perez-Tellez et al,
2009). Using this baseline, we then considered how
a clustering approach could be improved by apply-
ing text enrichment methods. In order to compare
only the effect of the enrichment however, we have
modified the data set by including only those tweets
written in English and for which a true or false
label has been established, i.e., in the experiments
carried out we do not consider the unknown label.
Furthermore, the subset used in the experiments
includes only those 20 companies with a sufficient
number of positive and negative samples (true/false),
i.e., at least 20 items must be in each category. Fi-
nally, each selected company must contain at least
90 labeled tweets, which was the minimum num-
ber of tweets associated with a company found in
the collection. In Table 2 we present a detailed de-
scription of the corpus features such as the number
of true and false tweets, the average length of the
tweets (average number of words),the minimum and
maximum number of words contained in tweets. In
the following section we present and compare the
different approaches we propose for dealing with
this problem.
4 Clustering Company Tweets
The purpose of this research work is to cluster tweets
that contain a possible company entity into two
148
groups, those that refer to the company and those
that refer to a different topic. We approach this
problem by introducing and, thereafter, evaluating
two different methodologies that use term expan-
sion. The term expansion of a set of documents is a
process for enriching the semantic similarity hidden
behind the lexical structure. Although the idea has
been previously studied in literature (Qiu and Frei,
1993; Grefenstette, 1994; Banerjee and Pedersen,
2002; Pinto et al, 2010) we are not aware of any
work in which has applied it to microblog texts. In
this paper, we evaluate the performance of two dif-
ferent approaches for term enriching in the task of
clustering company tweets.
In order to establish the difficulty of clustering
company tweets, we split the 20 companies group
into two groups that we hypothetically considered
easier and harder to be clustered. The first group
is composed of 10 companies with generic names,
i.e., names that can be ambiguous (i.e., they have an-
other common meaning and appear in a dictionary).
The second group contains specific names which are
considered to be less ambiguous (words that can be
used in limited number of contexts or words that do
not appear in a dictionary). We expect the latter
group will be easier to be categorised than the for-
mer one. In Table 3 we see the distribution of the
two groups. We have selected the K-means cluster-

ing method (MacQueen, 1967) for the experiments
carried out in this paper. The reason is that it is a
well-known method, it produces acceptable results
and our approaches may be compared with future
implementations. The clustering algorithm (includ-
ing the representation and matrix calculation) is ap-
plied after we have improved the representation of
tweets in order to show the improvement gained by
applying the enriching process.
Figure 1: Full Term Expansion Methodology
4.1 Full Term Expansion Methodology
(TEM-Full)
In this methodology we expand only the ambiguous
word (the company name) with all the words that co-
occur alongside it, without restrictions for the level
of co-occurrence. Our hypothesis states that the
ambiguous words may bring important information
from the identification of co-occurrence-relations to
the next step of filtering relevant terms. It is impor-
tant to mention that we have used the Term Selection
technique in order to select the most discriminative
terms for the categories. The process is shown in
Figure 1. Note that this expansion process does not
use an external resource. We believe that due to the
low term frequency and the shortness of the data, it
is better to include all the information that co-occurs
in the corpus of a company and provide more infor-
mation to the enriching process.
The Term Selection Technique helps us to identify
the best features for the clustering process. How-
ever, it is also useful to reduce the computing time
of the clustering algorithms.
4.2 Full Tem Expansion Methodology with a
Text Formaliser (TEM-Full+F)
In this approach, we test the hypothesis that we can
improve the cluster quality by increasing the level
of formality in the document text. Due to the length
restriction of 140 characters users tend to write com-
ments using abbreviations. We have used an ab-
breviation dictionary7 that contains 5,173 abbrevi-
ations commonly used in microblogs, tweets and
short messages. After the formalisation step, the ex-
pansion is performed but it is only applied to the
ambiguous word (the company name) and words
7http://noslang.com/dictionary
149
Figure 2: Full Term Expansion Methodology with a Text
Formaliser (TEM-Full+F)
which highly co-occur with it. These words were
selected as they appear in frequently with the am-
biguous word in positive tweets (i.e., those related
to the companies). We consider that this kind of
word may help us take the correct decision during
the clustering process because they are highly re-
lated with the company tweets. The words selected
to be expanded were closely related to the company
such as crew, jet, flight, airlines, airplane for Delta
company name. In the case of the Opera company
name the words expanded were software, technol-
ogy, developers, interface, web, browser. The num-
ber of words per company name were between five
and ten, showing that even a small number of words
that co-occur highly may help in the enriching pro-
cess. We have used the Term Selection Technique
as described in 4.1 and no external resource. The
process is shown in Figure 2.
5 Experimental Results
In this section we present the results obtain by the
related approaches and also the results obtained by
our methodologies proposed.
5.1 Related Approaches
Although the results are not directly comparable
with our approaches due to the slightly different
dataset used in the experiments (see Section 3), we
would like to provide a clear description of the dif-
ferent approaches with the objective of highlight the
strengths of the related approaches developed for
this purpose.

(Amigo? et al, 2010). It is important to mention that
all these systems used the whole collection even if
the companies subsets where very imbalanced. In
our case, we are interested in proposing approaches
that can deal with two different kind of company
names such as ?generic? and ?specific? rather than
one methodology for both.
In Table 4 the LSIR-EPFL system (Yerva et al,
2010) showed very good performance even when
the subsets are very imbalanced. The SINAI sys-
tem (Garc??a-Cumbreras et al, 2010) took advan-
tage of the entity recognition process and they re-
port that named entities contained in the microblog
documents seem to be appropriate for certain com-
pany names. ITC-UT (Yoshida et al, 2010) incor-
porated a classifier and made use of Named Entity
Recognition and Part-of-Speech tagger is also good
in their performance but as the authors in (Amigo?
et al, 2010) have mentioned ?it is difficult to know
what aspect lead the system to get ahead other sys-
tems? as each takes advantage of different aspects
available such as external resources or tools. UVA
(Tsagkias and Balog, 2010) is an interesting contri-
bution but the only problem is training data will not
always be available for some domains. Finally, the
KALMAR system (Kalmar, 2010) seems to achieve
good performance when applied to well-balanced
collections. In contrast to these approaches, we
would like to emphasize that our approaches are pre-
dominantly based on the information to be clustered.
5.2 Results of Our Experiments
In order to present the performance of the different
proposed approaches, we have calculated a baseline
based on clustering, with K-means, and with no en-
riching procedure. The obtained results using the
two methodologies are compared in Table 5. We
have shown in bold text the cases in which the result
equalled or improved upon the baseline. We have
compared the methodologies presented with the two
150
subsets (generic and specific company names sub-
sets) described previously.

to one baseline using the F -measure.

We consider that there still some limitations on
obtaining improved results due to the particular writ-
ing style of tweets. The corpus exhibits a poor
grammatical structure and many out-of-vocabulary
words, a fact that makes the task of clustering tweets
very difficult. There is, however, a clear improve-
ment in most cases in comparison with the baseline.
This indicates that the enriching procedure yields
benefits for the clustering process.
The TEM-Full methodology has demonstrated
good performance with the corpus of generic com-
pany names with 0.70 average (F-measure value) 8
points over the average baseline. In this case, we
have expanded only the ambiguous word (the name
of the company), whereas the TEM-Full+F method-
ologies performed well (0.74 F-measure) with the
corpus of specific company names. We have ob-
served that, regardless of whether or not we are
using an external resource in TEM-Full and TEM-
Full+F approaches, we may improve the representa-
tion of company tweets for the clustering task. It
is important to mention that the good results pre-
sented in companies such as Bestbuy or Lennar
were obtained because the low overlapping vocabu-
lary between the two categories (positive and neg-
ative) and, therefore, the clustering process could
find well-delimited groups. We also would like to
note that sometimes the methodologies have pro-
duced only minor performance improvement. This
we believe is largely due to the length of the tweets,
as it has been demonstrated in other experiments that
better results can be achieved with longer documents
(Perez-Tellez et al, 2009; Pinto et al, 2010).
The best result has been achieved with the TEM-
Full+F methodology which achieved an overall av-
erage F-measure value 0.72, it is 8 points more than
the overall average of the baseline. This methodol-
ogy has not disimproved on the baseline in any in-
stance and it produces good results in most cases.
Although the term expansion procedure has been
shown to be effective for improving the task of clus-
tering company tweets, we believe that there is still
room for improving the obtained F -Measure values
by detecting and filtering stronger relations that may
help in the identification of the positive company
tweets. This fact may lead us to consider that re-
gardless of the resource used (internal or external),
the clustering company tweets is a very difficult task.
6 Conclusions
Clustering short text corpora is a difficult task. Since
tweets are by definition short texts (having a maxi-
mum of 140 characters), the clustering of tweets is
also a challenging problem as stronger results typ-
ically achieved with longer text documents. Fur-
thermore, due to the nature of writing style of these
kinds of texts - typically they exhibits an informal
writing style, with poor grammatical structure and
many out of vocabulary words - this kind of data
typically causes most clustering methods to obtain
poor performance.
The main contribution of this paper has been to
propose and compare two different approaches for
representing tweets on the basis term expansion and
their impact on the problem of clustering company
151
tweets. In particular, we introduced two methodolo-
gies for enriching term representation of tweets. We
expected that these different representations would
lead classical clustering methods, such as K-means,
to obtain a better performance than when clustering
the same data set and the enriching methodology is
not applied.
We consider that TEM-Full performed well on
the former data set and, another methodology ob-
tained the best results on the latter data set TEM-
Full+F. However, the TEM-Full+F methodology
appears suitable for both kinds of corpora, and
does not require any external resource. TEM-Full
and TEM-Full+F are completely unsupervised ap-
proaches which construct a thesaurus from the same
data set to be clustered and, thereafter, uses this re-
source for enriching the terms. On the basis of the
results presented, we can say that using this par-
ticular data, the unsupervised methodology TEM-
Full+F has shown improved results.
This paper has reported on our efforts to ap-
ply clustering and term enrichment to the important
problem of company identification in microblogs.
We expect to do further work in proposing highly
scalable methods that may be able to deal with the
huge amounts of information published every day in
Twitter.
