A b strac t
After the release of the open sou rce softw are
implementation of M orfessor alg orithm, a se-
ries of several open evalu ations has b een or-
g aniz ed for u nsu pervised morpheme analy -
sis and morpheme-b ased speech recog nition
and information retrieval. T he u nsu pervised
morpheme analy sis is a particu larly attrac-
tive approach for speech and lang u ag e tech-
nolog y for the morpholog ically complex lan-
g u ag es. W hen the amou nt of distinct w ord
forms b ecomes prohib itive for the constru c-
tion of a su ffi cient lex icon, it is important
that the w ords can b e seg mented into smaller
meaning fu l lang u ag e modeling u nits. In this
presentation w e w ill demonstrate the resu lts
of the evalu ations, the b aseline sy stems b u ilt
u sing the open sou rce tools, and invite re-
search g rou ps to participate in the nex t eval-
u ation w here the task is to enhance statistical
machine translation b y morpheme analy sis.

1 .1 T he segmentation of w ords into
morphemes
O ne of the fu ndamental task s in natu ral lang u ag e
processing applications, su ch as larg e-vocab u lary
speech recog nition (L V CS R), statistical machine
translation (S M T ) and information retrieval (IR),
is the morpholog ical analy sis of w ords. It is par-
ticu larly important for the morpholog ically com-
plex lang u ag es, w here the amou nt of different
w ord forms is su b stantially increased b y infl ection,
derivation and composition. T he decomposition of
w ords is req u ired not only for u nderstanding the sen-
tence, b u t in many lang u ag es also for ju st represent-
ing the lang u ag e b y any tractab le and trainab le sta-
tistical model and lex icon. T he manu ally composed
ru le-b ased morpholog ical analy z ers can solve these
prob lems to some ex tent, b u t only a fraction of the
ex isting lang u ag es have b een covered so far, and for
many the coverag e of the relevant content is insu ffi -
cient.
T he ob jective of the M orpho Challeng e1 is to de-
sig n and evalu ate new u nsu pervised statistical ma-
chine learning alg orithms that discover w hich mor-
phemes (smallest individu ally meaning fu l u nits of
lang u ag e) w ords consist of. T he g oal is to discover
b asic vocab u lary u nits su itab le for different task s,
su ch as L V CS R, S M T and IR. In u nsu pervised learn-
ing the list of morphemes is not pre-specifi ed for
each lang u ag e, b u t the optimal morpheme lex icon
and morpheme analy sis of all different w ord forms
is statistically optimiz ed from a larg e tex t corpu s in
a completely data-driven manner.
T he evalu ation of the morpheme analy sis alg o-
rithms is performed b oth b y a ling u istic and an ap-
plication oriented task . T he analy sis ob tained for
a long list of w ords is fi rst compared to the lin-
g u istic g old standard representing a g rammatically
correct analy sis b y verify ing that the morpheme-
sharing w ord pairs are the correct ones (K u rimo et
al., 2 0 0 7 ) . T his is repeated in different lang u ag es
and then the ob tained decomposition of w ords is
applied in state-of-the-art sy stems ru nning variou s

NLP applications. The suitability of the morphemes
is v erifi ed by comparing the performance of the sys-
tems to each other and to systems using unprocessed
w ord s or conv entional w ord processing alg orithms
lik e stemming or rule-based d ecompositions.
A s a baseline method in all application, w e hav e
built systems by applying the M orfessor alg orithm,
w hich is an unsuperv ised w ord d ecomposition alg o-
rithm d ev eloped at our research g roup (C reutz and
Lag us, 20 0 2) and released as open source softw are
implementation2.
1.2 Morphemes in Information Retrieval
In information retriev al ( I R ) from tex t d ocuments a
typical task is to look for the most relev ant d ocu-
ments for a g iv en q uery. O ne of the k ey challeng es
is to red uce all the infl ected w ord forms to a common
root or stem for effectiv e ind ex ing . F rom the mor-
pheme analysis point of v iew this task is to d ecom-
pose all the w ord s in the q uery and tex t d ocuments
and fi nd out those common morphemes w hich form
the most relev ant link s.
In M orpho C halleng e the IR systems built using
the unsuperv ised morpheme analysis alg orithms are
compared in state-of-the-art C LE F task s in F innish,
G erman and E ng lish (K urimo and Turunen, 20 0 8 )
using the mean av erag e precision metric. The results
are also compared to those obtained by the g rammat-
ical morphemes as w ell as the stemming and w ord
normaliz ation method s conv entionally used in IR .
1.3 Morphemes in S peec h Rec og nition
In larg e-v ocabulary continuous speech recog nition
(LV C S R ) one k ey part of the process is the statis-
tical lang uag e mod eling w hich d etermines the prior
probabilities of all the possible w ord seq uences. A n
especially challeng ing task is to cov er all the pos-
sible w ord forms w ith suffi cient accuracy, because
any out-of-v ocabulary w ord s w ill not only be nev er
correctly recog niz ed , but also sev erely d eg rad e the
mod eling of the other nearby w ord s. B y d ecompos-
ing the w ord s into meaning ful sub-w ord units, such
as morphemes, larg e-v ocabulary lang uag e mod els
can be successfully built ev en for the most d iffi cult
ag g lutinativ e lang uag es, lik e F innish, E stonian and
Turk ish (K urimo et al, 20 0 6 b).
2S ee http://w w w .cis.hut.fi /projects/morpho/
In M orpho C halleng e the unsuperv ised mor-
pheme alg orithms hav e been compared by using
the morphemes to train statistical lang uag e mod els
and applying the mod els in state-of-the-art LV C S R
task s in F innish and Turk ish (K urimo et al, 20 0 6 a) .
B enchmark s for the same task s w ere obtained by
mod els that utiliz e the g rammatical morphemes as
w ell as trad itional w ord -based lang uag e mod els.
1.4 Morphemes in Mac hine T ranslation
The state-of-the-art statistical machine translation
(S M T) systems are affected by the morpholog ical
v ariation of w ord s at tw o d ifferent stag es (V irpi-
oja et al, 20 0 7 ) . In the fi rst stag e, the alig nment
of the source and targ et lang uag e w ord s in a par-
allel training corpus and the training of the transla-
tion mod el can benefi t from the d ecomposition of
complex w ord s into morphemes. This is particularly
important w hen either the targ et or the source lan-
g uag e, or both, are morpholog ically complex . The
fi nal stag e w here the targ et lang uag e tex t is g ener-
ated , may also req uire morpheme-based mod els, be-
cause the larg e-v ocabulary statistical lang uag e mod -
els are applied in the same w ay as in LV C S R .
In the on-g oing M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9 compe-
tition, the morpheme analysis alg orithms are com-
pared in S M T task s, w here the analysis is need ed
for the source lang uag e tex ts. The E uropean Par-
liament parallel corpus (K oehn, 20 0 5 ) is used in
the ev aluation. The source lang uag es are F innish
and G erman and the targ et in both task s is E ng lish.
To obtain a state-of-the-art performance in the task s
the morpheme-based S M T w ill be combined w ith a
w ord -based S M T using the M inimum B ayes R isk
( M B R ) interpolation of the N-best translation hy-
pothesis of both systems (d e G ispert et al, 20 0 9 ) .
1.5 Morpho C halleng e 20 0 9
A s its pred ecessors, the M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9
competition is open to all and free of charg e. The
participants? are ex pected to use their unsuperv ised
machine learning alg orithms to analyz e the w ord
lists of d ifferent lang uag es prov id ed by the org aniz -
ers and submit the results of their morpheme analy-
sis. The org aniz ers w ill then run the ling uistic ev al-
uations and build the IR and S M T systems and pro-
v id e all the results and comparisons of the d ifferent
systems. The participated alg orithms and ev aluation

results will be presented at the Morpho Challenge
work shop that is c urrently planned to tak e plac e
within the H L T - N A A CL 2 0 1 0 c onferenc e.
