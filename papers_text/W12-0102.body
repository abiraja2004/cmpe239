Abstract
In this paper we present and evaluate three
approaches to measure comparability of
documents in non-parallel corpora. We de-
velop a task-oriented definition of compa-
rability, based on the performance of auto-
matic extraction of translation equivalents
from the documents aligned by the pro-
posed metrics, which formalises intuitive
definitions of comparability for machine
translation research. We demonstrate ap-
plication of our metrics for the task of
automatic extraction of parallel and semi-
parallel translation equivalents and discuss
how these resources can be used in the
frameworks of statistical and rule-based
machine translation.
1 Introduction
Parallel corpora have been extensively exploited
in different ways in machine translation (MT)
? both in Statistical (SMT) and more recently,
in Rule-Based (RBMT) architectures: in SMT
aligned parallel resources are used for building
translation phrase tables and calculating transla-
tion probabilities; and in RBMT, they are used
for automatically building bilingual dictionaries
of translation equivalents and automatically deriv-
ing bilingual mappings for frequent structural pat-
terns. However, large parallel resources are not
always available, especially for under-resourced
languages or narrow domains. Therefore, in re-
cent years, the use of cross-lingual comparable
corpora has attracted considerable attention in
the MT community (Sharoff et al., 2006; Fung
and Cheung, 2004a; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005;
Babych et al., 2008).
Most of the applications of comparable cor-
pora focus on discovering translation equivalents
to support machine translation, such as bilingual
lexicon extraction (Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999;
Morin et al., 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Li and
Gaussier, 2010; Prachasson and Fung, 2011), par-
allel phrase extraction (Munteanu and Marcu,
2006), and parallel sentence extraction (Fung and
Cheung, 2004b; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005;
Munteanu et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2010).
Comparability between documents is often un-
derstood as belonging to the same subject domain,
genre or text type, so this definition relies on these
vague linguistic concepts. The problem with this
definition then is that it cannot be exactly bench-
marked, since it becomes hard to relate automated
measures of comparability to such inexact and un-
measurable linguistic concepts. Research on com-
parable corpora needs not only good measures for
comparability, but also a clearer, technologically-
grounded and quantifiable definition of compara-
bility in the first place.
In this paper we relate comparability to use-
fulness of comparable texts for MT. In particu-
lar, we propose a performance-based definition of
comparability, as the possibility to extract parallel
or quasi-parallel translation equivalents ? words,
phrases and sentences which are translations of
each other. This definition directly relates compa-
rability to texts? potential to improve the quality
of MT by adding extracted phrases to phrase ta-
bles, training corpus or dictionaries. It also can be
quantified as the rate of successful extraction of
translation equivalents by automated tools, such
as proposed in Munteanu and Marcu (2006).
Still, successful detection of translation equiv-
alents from comparable corpora very much de-
10
pends on the quality of these corpora, specifically
on the degree of their textual equivalence and suc-
cessful alignment on various text units. There-
fore, the goal of this work is to provide compa-
rability metrics which can reliably identify cross-
lingual comparable documents from raw corpora
crawled from the Web, and characterize the de-
gree of their similarity, which enriches compara-
ble corpora with the document alignment infor-
mation, filters out documents that are not useful
and eventually leads to extraction of good-quality
translation equivalents from the corpora.
To achieve this goal, we need to define a
scale to assess comparability qualitatively, met-
rics to measure comparability quantitatively, and
the sources to get comparable corpora from. In
this work, we directly characterize comparability
by how useful comparable corpora are for the task
of detecting translation equivalents in them, and
ultimately to machine translation. We focus on
document-level comparability, and use three cat-
egories for qualitative definition of comparability
levels, defined in terms of granularity for possible
alignment:
? Parallel: Traditional parallel texts that are
translations of each other or approximate
translations with minor variations, which can
be aligned on the sentence level.
? Strongly-comparable: Texts that talk about
the same event or subject, but in different
languages. For example, international news
about oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, or
linked articles in Wikipedia about the same
topic. These documents can be aligned on
the document level on the basis of their ori-
gin.
? Weakly-comparable: Texts in the same sub-
ject domain which describe different events.
For example, customer reviews about hotel
and restaurant in London. These documents
do not have an independent alignment across
languages, but sets of texts can be aligned
on the basis of belonging to the same subject
domain or sub-domain.
In this paper, we present three different ap-
proaches to measure the comparability of cross-
lingual (especially under-resourced languages)
comparable documents: a lexical mapping based
approach, a keyword based approach, and a ma-
chine translation based approach. The experimen-
tal results show that all of them can effectively
predict the comparability levels of the compared
document pairs. We then further investigate the
applicability of the proposed metrics by measur-
ing their impact on the task of parallel phrase ex-
traction from comparable corpora. It turns out
that, higher comparability level predicted by the
metrics consistently lead to more number of paral-
lel phrase extracted from comparable documents.
Thus, the metrics can help select more compara-
ble document pairs to improve the performance of
parallel phrase extraction.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses previous work. Section
3 introduces our comparability metrics. Section
4 presents the experimental results and evaluation.
Section 5 describes the application of the metrics.
Section 6 discusses the pros and cons of the pro-
posed metrics, followed by conclusions and future
work in Section 7.
2 Related Work
The term ?comparability?, which is the key con-
cept in this work, applies to the level of corpora,
documents and sub-document units. However, so
far there is no widely accepted definition of com-
parability. For example, there is no agreement on
the degree of similarity that documents in com-
parable corpora should have or on the criteria for
measuring comparability. Also, most of the work
that performs translation equivalent extraction in
comparable corpora usually assumes that the cor-
pora they use are reliably comparable and focuses
on the design of efficient extraction algorithms.
Therefore, there has been very little literature dis-
cussing the characteristics of comparable corpora
(Maia, 2003). In this section, we introduce some
representative work which tackles comparability
metrics.
Some studies (Sharoff, 2007; Maia, 2003;
McEnery and Xiao, 2007) analyse comparability
by assessing corpus composition, such as struc-
tural criteria (e.g., format and size), and linguistic
criteria (e.g., topic, domain, and genre). Kilgarriff
and Rose (1998) measure similarity and homo-
geneity between monolingual corpora. They gen-
erate word frequency list from each corpus and
then apply ?2 statistic on the most frequent n (e.g.,
500) words of the compared corpora.
11
The work which deals with comparability
measures in cross-lingual comparable corpora is
closer to our work. Saralegi et al. (2008) measure
the degree of comparability of comparable cor-
pora (English and Basque) according to the dis-
tribution of topics and publication dates of docu-
ments. They compute content similarity for all the
document pairs between two corpora. These sim-
ilarity scores are then input as parameters for the
EMD (Earth Mover?s Distance) distance measure,
which is employed to calculate the global com-
patibility of the corpora. Munteanu and Marcu
(2005; 2006) select more comparable document
pairs in a cross-lingual information retrieval based
manner by using a toolkit called Lemur1. The
retrieved document pairs then serve as input for
the tasks of parallel sentence and sub-sentence ex-
traction. Smith et al. (2010) treat Wikipedia as
a comparable corpus and use ?interwiki? links to
identify aligned comparable document pairs for
the task of parallel sentence extraction. Li and
Gaussier (2010) propose a comparability met-
ric which can be applied at both document level
and corpus level and use it as a measure to se-
lect more comparable texts from other external
sources into the original corpora for bilingual lex-
icon extraction. The metric measures the propor-
tion of words in the source language corpus trans-
lated in the target language corpus by looking up
a bilingual dictionary. They evaluate the met-
ric on the rich-resourced English-French language
pair, thus good dictionary resources are available.
However, this is not the case for under-resourced
languages in which reliable language resources
such as machine-readable bilingual dictionaries
with broad word coverage or word lemmatizers
might be not publicly available.
3 Comparability Metrics
To measure the comparability degree of document
pairs in different languages, we need to translate
the texts or map lexical items from the source lan-
guage into the target languages so that we can
compare them within the same language. Usually
this can be done by using bilingual dictionaries
(Rapp, 1999; Li and Gaussier, 2010; Prachasson
and Fung, 2011) or existing machine translation
tools. Based on this process, in this section we
present three different approaches to measure the

comparability of comparable documents.
3.1 Lexical mapping based metric
It is straightforward that we expect a bilingual dic-
tionary can be used for lexical mapping between a
language pair. However, unlike the language pairs
in which both languages are rich-resourced (e.g.,
English-French, or English-Spanish) and dictio-
nary resources are relatively easy to obtain, it is
likely that bilingual dictionaries with good word
coverage are not publicly available for under-
resourced languages (e.g., English-Slovenian, or
English-Lithuanian). In order to address this
problem, we automatically construct dictionaries
by using word alignment on large-scale parallel
corpora (e.g., Europarl and JRC-Acquis2).
Specifically, GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney,
2000) with default setting is used for word align-
ment on the JRC-Acquis parallel corpora (Stein-
berger et al., 2006). The aligned word pairs to-
gether with the alignment probabilities are then
converted into dictionary entries. For example,
in Estonian-English language pair, the alignment
example ?kompanii company 0.625? in the word
alignment table means the Estonian word ?kom-
panii? can be translated as (or aligned with) the
English candidate word ?company? with a prob-
ability of 0.625. In the dictionary, the transla-
tion candidates are ranked by translation proba-
bility in descending order. Note that the dictio-
nary collects inflectional form of words, but not
only base form of words. This is because the dic-
tionary is directly generated from the word align-
ment results and no further word lemmatization is
applied.
Using the resulting dictionary, we then per-
form lexical mapping in a word-for-word map-
ping strategy. We scan each word in the source
language texts to check if it occurs in the dic-
tionary entries. If so, the first translation candi-
date are recorded as the corresponding mapping
word. If there are more than one translation can-
didate, the second candidate will also be kept as
the mapping result if its translation probability is
higher than 0.33. For non-English and English
2The JRC-Acquis covers 22 European languages and
provides large-scale parallel corpora for all the 231 language
pairs.
3From the manual inspection on the word alignment re-
sults, we find that if the alignment probability is higher than
0.3, it is more reliable.
12
language pair, the non-English texts are mapped
into English. If both languages are non-English
(e.g., Greek-Romanian), we use English as a pivot
langauge and map both the source and target
language texts into English4. Due to the lack
of reliable linguistic resources in non-English
languages, mapping texts from non-English lan-
guage into English can avoid language process-
ing in non-English texts and allows us to make
use of the rich resources in English for further
text processing, such as stop-word filtering and
word lemmatization5. Finally, cosine similarity
measure is applied to compute the comparability
strength of the compared document pairs.
3.2 Keyword based metric
The lexical mapping based metric takes all the
words in the text into account for comparability
measure, but if we only retain a small number of
representative words (keywords) and discard all
the other less informative words in each docu-
ment, can we judge the comparability of a doc-
ument pair by comparing these words? Our in-
tuition is that, if two document share more key-
words, they should be more comparable. To
validate this, we then perform keyword extrac-
tion by using a simple TFIDF based approach,
which has been shown effective for keyword or
keyphrase extraction from the texts (Frank et al.,
1999; Hulth, 2003; Liu et al., 2009).
More specifically, the keyword based metric
can be described as below. First, similar to the
lexical mapping based metric, bilingual dictionar-
ies are used to map non-English texts into En-
glish. Thus, only the English resources are ap-
plied for stop-word filtering and word lemmatiza-
tion, which are useful text preprocessing steps for
keyword extraction. We then use TFIDF to mea-
sure the weight of words in the document and rank
the words by their TFIDF weights in descending
order. The top n (e.g., 30) words are extracted
as keywords to represent the document. Finally,
the comparability of each document pair is deter-
mined by applying cosine similarity to their key-
4Generally in JRC-Acquis, the size of parallel corpora
for most of non-English langauge pairs is much smaller than
that of language pairs which contain English. Therefore, the
resulting bilingual dictionaries which contain English have
better word coverage as they have many more dictionary en-
tries.

tion.
word lists.
3.3 Machine translation based metrics
Bilingual dictionary is used for word-for-word
translation in the lexical mapping based metric
and words which do not occur in the dictionary
will be omitted. Thus, the mapping result is like
a list of isolated words and information such as
word order, syntactic structure and named entities
can not be preserved. Therefore, in order to im-
prove the text translation quality, we turn to the
state-of-the-art SMT systems.
In practice, we use Microsoft translation API6
to translate texts in under-resourced languages
(e.g, Lithuanian and Slovenian) into English and
then explore several features for comparability
metric design, which are listed as below.
? Lexical feature: Lemmatized bag-of-word
representation of each document after stop-
word filtering. Lexical similarity (denoted
by WL) of each document pair is then ob-
tained by applying cosine measure to the lex-
ical feature.
? Structure feature: We approximate it by
the number of content words (adjectives, ad-
verbs, nouns, verbs and proper nouns) and
the number of sentences in each document,
denoted by CD and SD respectively. The in-
tuition is that, if two documents are highly
comparable, their number of content words
and their document length should be similar.
The structure similarity (denoted by WS) of
two documentsD1 andD2 is defined as bel-
low.
WS = 0.5 ? (CD1/CD2)+ 0.5 ? (SD1/SD2)
suppose that CD1<=CD2, and SD1<=SD2.
? Keyword feature: Top-20 words (ranked by
TFIDF weight) of each document. keyword
similarity (denoted by WK) of two docu-
ments is also measured by cosine.
? Named entity feature: Named entities of
each document. If more named entities co-
occur in two documents, they are very likely
to talk about the same event or subject and

translator-java-api/
13
thus should be more comparable. We use
Stanford named entity recognizer7 to extract
named entities from the texts (Finkel et al.,
2005). Again, cosine is then applied to mea-
sure the similarity of named entities (denoted
by WN ) between a document pair.
We then combine these four different types of
score in an ensemble manner. Specifically, a
weighted average strategy is applied: each indi-
vidual score is associated with a constant weight,
indicating the relative confidence (importance) of
the corresponding type of score. The overall com-
parability score (denoted by SC) of a document
pair is thus computed as below:
SC = ? ?WL + ? ?WS + ? ?WK + ? ?WN
where ?, ?, ?, and ? ? [0, 1], and ?+?+?+? =
1. SC should be a value between 0 and 1, and
larger SC value indicates higher comparability
level.
4 Experiment and Evaluation
4.1 Data source
To investigate the reliability of the proposed
comparability metrics, we perform experiments
for 6 language pairs which contain under-
resoured languages: German-English (DE-EN),
Estonian-English (ET-EN), Lithuanian-English
(LT-EN), Latvian-English (LV-EN), Slovenian-
English (SL-EN) and Greek-Romanian (EL-RO).
A comparable corpus is collected for each lan-
guage pair. Based on the definition of compa-
rability levels (see Section 1), human annota-
tors fluent in both languages then manually anno-
tated the comparability degree (parallel, strongly-
comparable, and weakly-comparable) at the doc-
ument level. Hence, these bilingual comparable
corpora are used as gold standard for experiments.
The data distribution for each language pair, i.e.,
number of document pairs in each comparability
level, is given in Table 1.
4.2 Experimental results
We adopt a simple method for evaluation. For
each language pair, we compute the average
scores for all the document pairs in the same com-
parability level, and compare them to the gold

standard comparability labels. In addition, in or-
der to better reveal the relation between the scores
obtained from the proposed metrics and compara-
bility levels, we also measure the Pearson correla-
tion between them8. For the keyword based met-
ric, top 30 keywords are extracted from each text
for experiment. For the machine translation based
metric, we empirically set ? = 0.5, ? = ? = 0.2,
and ? = 0.1. This is based on the assumption
that, lexical feature can best characterize the com-
parability given the good translation quality pro-
vided by the powerful MT system, while keyword
and named entity features are also better indica-
tors of comparability than the simple document
length information.
The results for the lexical mapping based met-
ric, the keyword based metric and the machine
translation based metric are listed in Table 2, 3,
and 4, respectively.

responding average comparability scores automatically de-

Table 4: Average comparability scores for machine
translation based metric
ably reflect the comparability levels across dif-
ferent language pairs, as the average scores
for higher comparable levels are always sig-
nificantly larger than those of lower compara-
ble levels, namely SC(parallel)>SC(strongly-
comparable)>SC(weakly-comparable). In addi-
tion, in all the three metrics, the Pearson correla-
tion scores are very high (over 0.93) across dif-
ferent language pairs, which indicate that there
is strong correlation between the comparability
scores obtained from the metrics and the corre-
sponding comparability level.
Moreover, from the comparison of Table 2, 3,
and 4, we also have several other findings. Firstly,
the performance of keyword based metric (see
Table 3) is comparable to the lexical mapping
based metric (see Table 2) as their comparability
scores for the corresponding comparability levels
are similar. This means it is reasonable to deter-
mine the comparability level by only comparing a
small number of keywords of the texts. Secondly,
the scores obtained from the machine translation
based metric (see Table 4) are significantly higher
than those in both the lexical mapping based met-
ric and the keyword based metric. Clearly, this
is due to the advantages of using the state-of-the-
art MT system. In comparison to the approach
of using dictionary for word-for-word mapping,
it can provide much better text translation which
allows detecting more proportion of lexical over-
lapping and mining more useful features in the
translated texts. Thirdly, in the lexical mapping
based metric and keyword based metric, we can
also see that, although the average scores for EL-
RO (both under-resourced languages) conform to
the comparability levels, they are much lower than
those of the other 5 language pairs. The reason
is that, the size of the parallel corpora in JRC-
Acquis for these 5 language pairs are significantly
larger (over 1 million parallel sentences) than that
of EL-EN, RO-EN9, and EL-RO, thus the result-
ing dictionaries of these 5 language pairs also con-
tain many more dictionary entries.
5 Application
The experiments in Section 4 confirm the reli-
ability of the proposed metrics. The compara-
bility metrics are thus useful for collecting high-
quality comparable corpora, as they can help filter
out weakly comparable or non-comparable doc-
ument pairs from the raw crawled corpora. But
are they also useful for other NLP tasks, such as
translation equivalent detection from comparable
corpora? In this section, we further measure the
impact of the metrics on parallel phrase extraction
(PPE) from comparable corpora. Our intuition is
that, if document pairs are assigned higher com-
parability scores by the metrics, they should be
more comparable and thus more parallel phrases
can be extracted from them.
The algorithm of parallel phrase extraction,
which develops the approached presented in
Munteanu and Marcu (2006), uses lexical over-
lap and structural matching measures (Ion, 2012).
Taking a list of bilingual comparable document
pairs as input, the extraction algorithm involves
the following steps.
1. Split the source and target language docu-
ments into phrases.
2. Compute the degree of parallelism for each
candidate pair of phrases by using the bilin-
gual dictionary generated from GIZA++
(base dictionary), and retain all the phrase
pairs with a score larger than a predefined
parallelism threshold.
9Remember that in our experiment, English is used as the
pivot language for non-English langauge pairs.
15
3. Apply GIZA++ to the retained phrase pairs
to detect new dictionary entries and add them
to the base dictionary.
4. Repeat Step 2 and 3 for several times (empir-
ically set at 5) by using the augmented dic-
tionary, and output the detected phrase pairs.
Phrases which are extracted by this algorithm
are frequently not exact translation equivalents.
Below we give some English-German examples
of extracted equivalents with their corresponding
alignment scores:
1. But a successful mission ? seiner u?beraus
erfolgreichen Mission abgebremst ?
0.815501989333333
2. Former President Jimmy Carter ? Der
ehemalige US-Pra?sident Jimmy Carter ?
0.69708324976825
3. on the Korean Peninsula ? auf der koreanis-
chen Halbinsel ? 0.8677432145
4. across the Muslim world ? mit der muslim-
ischen Welt ermo?glichen ? 0.893330864
5. to join the United Nations ? der Weg
in die Vereinten Nationen offensteht ?
0.397418711927629
Even though some of the extracted phrases are
not exact translation equivalents, they may still
be useful resources both for SMT and RBMT if
these phrases are passed through an extra pre-
processing stage, of if the engines are modified
specifically to work with semi-parallel translation
equivalents extracted from comparable texts. We
address this issue in the discussion section (see
Section 6).
For evaluation, we measure how the metrics af-
fect the performance of parallel phrase extraction
algorithm on 5 language pairs (DE-EN, ET-EN,
LT-EN, LV-EN, and SL-EN). A large raw compa-
rable corpus for each language pair was crawled
from the Web, and the metrics were then applied
to assign comparability scores to all the docu-
ment pairs in each corpus. For each language pair,
we set three different intervals based on the com-
parability score (SC) and randomly select 500
document pairs in each interval for evaluation.
For the MT based metric, the three intervals are
(1) 0.1<=SC<0.3, (2) 0.3<=SC<0.5, and (3)
SC>=0.5. For the lexical mapping based metric
and keyword based metric, since their scores are
lower than those of the MT based metric for each
comparability level, we set three lower intervals at
(1) 0.1<=SC<0.2, (2) 0.2<=SC<0.4, and (3)
SC>=0.4. The experiment focuses on counting
the number of extracted parallel phrases with par-
allelism score>=0.410, and computes the average
number of extracted phrases per 100000 words
(the sum of words in the source and target lan-
guage documents) for each interval. In addition,
the Pearson correlation measure is also applied to
measure the correlation between the interval11 of
comparability scores and the number of extracted
parallel phrases. The results which summarize the
impact of the three metrics to the performance of
parallel phrase extraction are listed in Table 5, 6,
and 7, respectively.

Table 6: Impact of the keyword based metric to parallel
phrase extraction
From Table 5, 6, and 7, we can see that
for all the 5 language pairs, based on the aver-
age number of extracted aligned phrases, clearly
we have interval (3)>(2)>(1). In other words, in
any of the three metrics, a higher comparability
level always leads to significantly more number

shows that parallel phrases with parallelism score>=0.4 are
more reliable.

vals are numerically calibrated as ?1?, ?2?, and ?3?, respec-
tively.

Table 7: Impact of the machine translation based met-
ric to parallel phrase extraction
of aligned phrases extracted from the comparable
documents. Moreover, although the lexical map-
ping based metric and the keyword based metric
produce lower comparability scores than the MT
based metric (see Section 4), they have similar
impact to the task of parallel phrase extraction.
This means, the comparability score itself does
not matter much, as long as the metrics are re-
liable and proper thresholds are set for different
metrics.
In all the three metrics, the Pearson correla-
tion scores are very close to 1 for all the language
pairs, which indicate that the intervals of compa-
rability scores obtained from the metrics are in
line with the performance of equivalent extrac-
tion algorithm. Therefore, in order to extract more
parallel phrases (or other translation equivalents)
from comparable corpora, we can try to improve
the corpus comparability by applying the compa-
rability metrics beforehand to add highly compa-
rable document pairs in the corpora.
6 Discussion
We have presented three different approaches to
measure comparability at the document level. In
this section, we will analyze the advantages and
limitations of the proposed metrics, and the feasi-
bility of using semi-parallel equivalents in MT.
6.1 Pros and cons of the metrics
Using bilingual dictionary for lexical mapping is
simple and fast. However, as it adopts the word-
for-word mapping strategy and out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words are omitted, the linguistic structure
of the original texts is badly hurt after mapping.
Thus, apart from lexical information, it is diffi-
cult to explore more useful features for the com-
parability metrics. The TFIDF based keyword ex-
traction approach allows us to select more repre-
sentative words and prune a large amount of less
informative words from the texts. The keywords
are usually relevant to subject and domain terms,
which is quite useful in judging the comparabil-
ity of two documents. Both the lexical mapping
based approach and the keyword based approach
use dictionary for lexical translation, thus rely on
the availability and completeness of the dictionary
resources or large scale parallel corpora.
For the machine translation based metric, it
provides much better text translation than the
dictionary-based approach so that the comparabil-
ity of two document can be better revealed from
the richer lexical information and other useful
features, such as named entities. However, the
text translation process is expensive, as it depends
on the availability of the powerful MT systems12
and takes much longer than the simple dictionary
based translation.
In addition, we use a translation strategy of
translating texts from under-resourced (or less-
resourced) languages into rich-resourced lan-
guage. In case that both languages are under-
resourced languages, English is used as the pivot
langauge for translation. This can compensate the
shortage of the linguistic resources in the under-
resourced languages and take advantages of vari-
ous resources in the rich-resourced languages.
6.2 Using semi-parallel equivalents in MT
systems
We note that modern SMT and RBMT sys-
tems take maximal advantage of strictly parallel
phrases, but they still do not use full potential
of the semi-parallel translation equivalents, of the
type that is illustrated in the application section
(see Section 5). Such resources, even though they
are not exact equivalents contain useful informa-
tion which is not used by the systems.
In particular, the modern decoders do not work
with under-specified phrases in phrase tables, and
do not work with factored semantic features. For
example, the phrase:
But a successful mission ? seiner u?beraus er-
folgreichen Mission abgebremst
The English side contains the word but, which
pre-supposes contrast, and on the Greman side
words u?beraus erfolgreichen (?generally success-
ful?) and abgebremst (?slowed down?) ? which
taken together exemplify a contrast, since they
12Alternatively, we can also train MT systems for text
translation by using the available SMT toolkits (e.g., Moses)
on large scale parallel corpora.

have different semantic prosodies. In this example
the semantic feature of contrast can be extracted
and reused in other contexts. However, this would
require the development of a new generation of
decoders or rule-based systems which can suc-
cessfully identify and reuse such subtle semantic
features.
7 Conclusion and Future work
The success of extracting good-quality translation
equivalents from comparable corpora to improve
machine translation performance highly depends
on ?how comparable? the used corpora are. In this
paper, we propose three different comparability
measures at the document level. The experiments
show that all the three approaches can effectively
determine the comparability levels of comparable
document pairs. We also further investigate the
impact of the metrics on the task of parallel phrase
extraction from comparable corpora. It turns out
that higher comparability scores always lead to
significantly more parallel phrases extracted from
comparable documents. Since better quality of
comparable corpora should have better applica-
bility, our metrics can be applied to select highly
comparable document pairs for the tasks of trans-
lation equivalent extraction.
In the future work, we will conduct more com-
prehensive evaluation of the metrics by capturing
its impact to the performance of machine transla-
tion systems with extended phrase tables derived
from comparable corpora.
