ABSTRACT 
The limited capacity of working memory is 
intrinsic to human sentence processing, and 
therefore must be addressed by any theory 
of human sentence processing. This paper 
gives a theory of garden-path effects and pro- 
cessing overload that is based on simple as- 
sumptions about human short term memory 
capacity. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The limited capacity of working memory is intrinsic 
to human sentence processing, and therefore must be 
addressed by any theory of human sentence process- 
ing. I assume that the amount of short term memory 
that is necessary at any stage in the parsing process is 
determined by the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic 
properties of the structure(s) that have been built up to 
that point in the parse. A sentence becomes unaccept- 
able for processing reasons if the combination of these 
properties produces too great a load for the working 
memory capacity (cf. Frazier 1985): 
(1) 
n 
E Aixi > K 
i=1 
where: 
K is the maximum allowable processing load 
(in processing load units or PLUs), 
xl is the number of PLUs associated with prop- 
erty i, 
n is the number of properties, 
Ai is the number of times property i appears in 
the structure in question. 
Furthermore, the assumptions described above pro- 
vide a simple mechanism for the explanation of com- 
mon psycholinguistic phenomena such as garden-path 
effects and preferred readings for ambiguous sentences. 
Following Fodor (1983), I assume that the language 
processor is an automatic device that uses a greedy al- 
gorithm: only the best of the set of all compatible r p- 
resentations for an input string are locally maintained 
from word to word. One way to make this idea explicit 
is to assume that restrictions on memory allow at most 
one representation foran input string at any time (see, 
for example, Frazier and Fodor 1978; Frazier 1979; 
Marcus 1980; Berwick and Weinberg 1984; Pritchett 
1988). This hypothesis, commonly called the serial 
39 
hypothesis, is easily compatible with the above view 
of processing load calculation: given a choice between 
two different representations forthe same input string, 
simply choose the representation that is associated with 
the lower processing load. 
The serial hypothesis  just one way of placing local 
memory restrictions on the parsing model, however. In 
this paper I will present an alternative formulation of 
local memory restrictions within a parallel framework. 
There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguis- 
tic literature as to whether or not more than one rep- 
resentation for an input can be maintained in parallel 
(see, for example, Kurtzman (1985) or Gorrell (1987) 
for a history of the debate). It turns out that the par- 
aUel view appears to handle some kinds of data more 
directly than the serial view, keeping in mind that the 
data are often controversial. For example, it is difficult 
to explain in a serial model why relative processing 
load increases as ambiguous input is encountered (see, 
for example, Fodor et al 1968; Rayner et al 1983; 
GorreU 1987). Data that is normally taken to be support 
for the serial hypothesis includes garden-path effects 
and the existence of preferred readings of ambiguous 
input. However, as noted above, limiting the number 
of allowable representations is only one way of con- 
straining parallelism so that these effects can also be 
accounted for in a parallel framework. 
As a result of the plausibility of a parallel model, I
propose to limit the difference in processing load that 
may be present between two structures for the same in- 
put, rather than limit the number of structures allowed 
in the processing of an input (cf. Gibson 1987; Gibson 
and Clark 1987; Clark and Gibson 1988). Thus I as- 
sume that the human parser prefers one structure over 
another when the processing load (in PLUs) associated 
with maintaining the first is markedly lower than the 
processing load associated with maintaining the sec- 
ond. That is, I assume there exists some arithmetic 
preference quantity P corresponding to a processing 
load, such that if the processing loads associated with 
two representations for the same string differ by load P, 
then only the representation associated with the smaller 
of the two loads is pursued. 1 Given the existence of a 
lit is possible that he preference factor is a geometric one 
rather than an arithmetic one. Given a geometric preference 
factor, one structure ispreferred over another when the ratio 
of their processing loads reaches athreshold value. I explore 
only the arithmetic possibility in this paper; it is possible 
that the geometric alternative gives results that are as good, 
although I leave this issue for future research. 
preference factor P, it is easy to account for garden-path 
effects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences. 
Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity which 
is resolved in favor of one reading. In the case of a 
garden-path effect, the favored reading is not compati- 
ble with the whole sentence. Given two representations 
for the same input string that differ in processing load 
by at least the factor P, only the less computationally 
expensive structure will be pursued. If that structure 
is not compatible with the rest of the sentence and the 
discarded structure is part of a successful parse of the 
sentence, a garden-path effect results. If the parse is 
successful, but the discarded structure is compatible 
with another reading for the sentence, then only a pre- 
ferred reading for the sentence has been calculated. 
Thus if we know where one reading of a (temporarily) 
ambiguous entence becomes the strongly preferred 
reading, we can write an inequality associated with 
this preference: 
(2) 
n B 
ZA,x,- Z ,x, 
i=1 i=1 
where: 
P is the preference factor (in PLUs), 
xi is the number of PLUs associated with prop- 
erty i, 
n is the number of properties, 
Ai is the number of times property i appears in 
the unpreferred structure, 
Bz is the number of times property i appears in 
the preferred structure. 
Given a parsing algorithm together with n proper- 
ties and their associated processing loads x~ ...xn, we 
may write inequalities having the form of (1) and (2) 
corresponding to the processing load at various parse 
states. An algebraic technique called iinearprogram- 
ruing can then be used to solve this system of linear 
inequalities, giving an n-dimensional space for the val- 
ues ofxi as a solution, any point of which satisfies all 
the inequalities. 
In this paper I will concentrate on syntactic 
properties: 2 in particular, I present wo properties 
based on the 0-Criterion of Government and Binding 
Theory (Chomsky 1981). 3 It will be shown that these 
properties, once associated with processing loads, pre- 
dict a large array of garden-path effects. Furthermore, 
it is demonstrated that these properties also make de- 
2Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and 
pragmatic properties which are associated with significant 
processing loads, but which axe not discussed here. 
3In another syntactic theory, similar properties may be ob- 
tained from the principles that correspond to the 0-Criterion 
in that heory. For example, the completeness and coherence 
conditions of Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 1982) 
would derive properties imilar to those derived from the 
0-Criterion. The same empirical effects should result from 
these two sets of properties. 
sirable predictions with respect o unacceptability due 
to memory capacity overload. 
The organization of this paper is given as follows: 
first, the structure of the underlying parser is described; 
second, the two syntactic properties are proposed; 
third, a number of locally ambiguous entences, in- 
cluding some garden-paths, are examined with respect 
to these properties and a solution space for the process- 
ing loads of the two properties i calculated; fourth, it 
is shown that his space seems to make the right predic- 
tions with respect o processing overload; conclusions 
are given in the final section. 
2 THE UNDERLY ING PARSER 
The parser to which the memory limitation constraints 
apply must construct representations in such a way 
so that incomplete input will be associated with some 
structure. Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, in 
principle, allow more than one structure for an input 
string, so that the general constraints described in the 
previous ection may apply to restrict he possibilities. 
The parsing model that I will assume is an extension of 
the model described in Clark and Gibson (1988). When 
a word is input, representations for each of its lexical 
entries axe built and placed in the buffer, a one cell 
data structure that holds a set of tree structures. The 
parsing model contains a second data structure, the 
stack-set, which contains a set of stacks of buffer cells. 
The parser builds trees in parallel based on possible 
attachments made between the buffer and the top of 
each stack in the stack-set. The buffer and stack-set 
are formally defined in (3) and (4). 
(3) A buffer cell is a set of structures { SI,... ,S, }, 
where each Si represents he same segment of the input 
string. The buffer contains one buffer cell. 
(4) The stack-set isa set of stacks of buffer cells, where 
each stack represents the same segment of the input 
string: 
40 
{ ( { S1,1,1,S1,1,2, ...,Sl,l,nl,l }, 
{ S1,2,1, S1,2,2,..., S1,2,nt,2 } ... .  
{ S1,.,,,1,S1,.,1,2 .... , $1,.,, .,,., } ) 
i"{ s.,,,1,s.,1,2, ...,s.,,,..,, ). 
{ s.,2,1, s.,2,2, ...,s.,2,.... } .... 
( .... } ) } 
where: 
p is the number of stacks; 
ml is the number of buffer cells in stack i; 
and nij is the number of tree structures in the 
jth buffer cell of stack i. 
The motivation for these data structures is given 
by the desire for a completely unconstrained parsing 
algorithm upon which constraints may be placed: this 
algorithm should allow all possible parser operations 
to occur at each parse state. There are exactly two 
parser operations: attaching a node to another node and 
pushing a buffer cell onto a stack. In order to allow 
both of these operations to be performed in parallel, 
it is necessary to have the given data structures: the 
buffer and the stack-set. For example, consider a parser 
state in which the buffer is non-empty and the stack-set 
contains only a single cell stack: 
(5) 
Stack-set: { { { $1, ...,Sn } } } 
Buffer: { Bt, ...,Bin } 
Suppose that attachments are possible between the 
buffer and the single stack cell. The structures that 
result from these attachments will take up a single stack 
cell. Let us call these resultant s ructures A1, Az, ...,Ak. 
If all possible operations are to take place at this parser 
state, then the contents of the current buffer must also 
be pushed on top of the current stack. Thus two stacks, 
both representing the same segment of the input string 
will result: 
(6) 
Stack 1: { { {at , . . . ,ak  } } } 
Stack 2: { { { B1, ...,Bin } { St, ...,S, } } } 
Since these two stacks break up the same segment 
of the input string in different ways, the stack-set data 
structure is necessary. 
3 TWO SYNTACTIC  PROPERTIES  
DERIVABLE FROM THE 
0 -CRITERION 
Following early work in linguistic theory, I distin- 
guish two kinds of categories: functional categories 
and thematic or content categories (see, for example, 
Fukui and Speas (1986) and Abney (1987) and the ref- 
erences cited in each). Thematic ategories include 
nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions; functional 
categories include determiners, complementizers, and 
inflection markers. There are a number of properties 
that distinguish functional elements from thematic ele- 
ments, the most crucial being that functional elements 
mark grammatical orrelational features while thematic 
elements pick out a class of objects or events. I will as- 
sume as a working hypothesis that only those syntactic 
properties that have to do with the thematic elements of 
an utterance are relevant to preferences and overload 
in processing. One principle of syntax that is directly 
involved with the thematic ontent of an utterance in a 
Government-Binding theory is the 0-Criterion: 
(7) Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (the- 
matic role) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only 
one argument (Chomsky 1981:36). 
I hypothesize that the human parser attempts to lo- 
caUy satisfy the 0-Criterion whenever possible. Thus 
given a thematic role, the parser prefers to assign that 
role, and given a thematic element, he parser prefers 
to assign a role to that element. These assumptions are 
made explicit as the following properties: 
(8) The Property of Thematic Reception (PTR): 
Associate a load of XrR PLUs of short term memory 
to each thematic element that is in a position that can 
receive a thematic role in some co-existing structure, 
but whose 0-assigner isnot unambiguously identifiable 
in the structure in question. 
(9) The Property of Thematic Assignment (PTA): 
Associate a load of XTA PLUs of short term memory 
to each thematic role that is not assigned to a node 
containing a thematic element. 
Note that the Properties of Thematic Assignment 
and Reception are stated in terms of thematic elements. 
Thus the Property of Thematic Reception doesn't apply 
to functional categories, whether or not they are in 
positions that receive thematic roles. Similarly, if a 
thematic role is assigned to a functional category, the 
Property of Thematic Assignment does not notice until 
there is a thematic element inside this constituent.

4 AMBIGUITY  AND THE 
PROPERTIES  OF  THEMATIC  
ASS IGNMENT AND RECEPT ION 
Consider sentence (10) with respect o the Properties 
of Thematic Assignment and Reception: 
(10) John expected Mary to like Fred. 
The verb expect is ambiguous: either it takes an NP 
complement asin the sentence John expected Mary or 
it takes an IP complement as in (10). 4 Consider the 
state of the parse of (10) after the word Mary has been 
processed: 
(11) a. \[re Lvt, John \] \[v? expected ~e Mary \]\]\] 
b. \[tp \[~p John \] \[vp expected \[tp Lvp Mary \] \]\]\] 
In (1 la), the NP Mary is attached as the NP com- 
plement of expected. In this representation there is no 
load associated with either of the Properties of The- 
matic Assignment or Reception since no thematic ele- 
ments need thematic roles and no thematic roles are left 
unassigned. In ( l lb), the NP Mary is the specifier of 
a hypothesized IP node which is attached as the com- 
plement of the other reading of expected. 5 This rep- 
resentation is associated with at least xrR PLUs since 
the NP Mary is in a position that can be associated 
with a thematic role, the subject position, but whose 
0-assigner is not yet identifiable. No load is associated 
with the Property of Thematic Assignment, however, 
since both thematic roles of the verb expected are as- 
signed to nodes that contain thematic elements. Since 
4Following current notation in GB Theory, IP (Inflection 
Phrase) = S and CP (Complementizer Phrase) = S' (Chomsky 
1986). 
51 assume some form of hypothesis-driven node projec- 
tion so that noun phrases are projected to those categories that 
they may specify. Motivation for this kind of projection algo- 
rithm is given by the processing of Dutch (Frazier 1987) and 
the processing of certain English noun phrase constructions 
(Gibson 1989). 
there is no difficulty in processing sentence (10), the 
load difference between these two structures cannot be 
greater than P PLUs, the preference factor in inequality 
(2). Thus the inequality in (12) is obtained: 
(12) xrR < P 
Since the load difference between the two struc- 
tures is not sufficient to cause a strong preference, both 
structures are maintained. Note that this is an im- 
portant difference between the theories presented here 
and the theory presented in Frazier and Fodor (1978), 
Frazier (1979) and Pritchett (1988). In each of these 
theories, only one representation can be maintained, 
so that either ( l la)  or ( l lb)  would be preferred. In 
order to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing 
(10), Frazier and Pritchett both assume that reanalysis 
in certain situations is not expensive. No such stipu- 
lation is necessary in the framework given here: it is 
simply assumed that all reanalysis i expensive. 6 
Consider now sentence (13) with respect to the Prop- 
erties of Thematic Assignment and Reception: 
(13) John expected her mother to like Fred. 
Consider the state of the parse of (13) after the word 
her has been processed. In one representation the NP 
her will be attached as the NP complement ofexpected: 
(14) \[tp \[up John \] \[vp expected Lvv her \]\]\] 
In this representation there is no load associated with 
either of the Properties of Thematic Assignment or Re- 
ception since no thematic objects need thematic roles 
and no thematic roles are left unassigned. In another 
representation the NP her is the specifier of a hypoth- 
esized NP which is pushed onto a substack containing 
the other eading of the verb expected: 
(15){ { \[tp \[ueJohn\] [vpexpected \[tp e\]\]\] } 
{ \[~p ~p her \] \] } } 
This representation is associated with at least xra 
PLUs since the verb expected has a thematic role to as- 
sign. However, no load is associated with the genitive 
NP specifier her since its a-assigner, although not yet 
present, is unambiguously identified as the head of the 
NP to follow (Chomsky (1986a)). 7 Thus the total oad 
associated with (15) is xra PLUs. Since there is no dif- 
ficulty in processing sentence (10), the load difference 
6See Section 4.1 for a brief comparison between the model 
proposed here and serial models uch as those proposed by 
Frazier and Fodor (1978) and Pritchett (1988). 
7Note that specifiers do not always receive their thematic 
roles from the categories which they specify. For example, 
a non-genitive noun phrase may specify any major category. 
In particular, itmay specify an IP or a CP. But the specifier of 
these categories may receive its thematic role through chain 
formation from a distant 0-assigner, as in (16): 
(16) John appears to like beans. 
Note that here is no NP that corresponds to(16) (Chomsky 
(1970)): 
(17) * John's appearance to like beans. 
42 
between these two structures cannot be greater than P 
PLUs. Thus the second inequality, (18), is obtained: 
(18) xra < P 
Now consider (19): s 
(19) # I put the candy on the table in my mouth. 
This sentence becomes ambiguous when the prepo- 
sition on is read. This preposition may attach as an 
argument of the verbput or as a modifier of the NP the 
candy: 
(20) a. I \[vv Iv, Iv put \] Lvv the candy \] \[ee on \] \]\] 
b. I \[vv Iv, Iv put \] Lvv the candy \[ep on \] \] \]\] 
At this point the argument attachment is strongly 
preferred. However, this attachment turns out to be 
incompatible with the rest of the sentence. When the 
word mouth is encountered, no pragmatically coherent 
structure can be built, since tables are not normally 
found in mouths. Thus a garden-path effect results. 
Consider the parse state depicted in (20) with respect to 
the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Reception. 
The load associated with the structure resulting from 
argument attachment is XrA PLUs since, although the a- 
grid belonging to the verbput is filled, the thematic role 
assigned by the preposition on remains unassigned. On 
the other hand, the load associated with the modifier 
attachment is 2 *XrA +xrR PLUs since 1) both the verb 
put and the preposition on have thematic roles that need 
to be assigned and 2) the PP headed by on receives 
a thematic role in the argument attachment s ructure, 
while it receives no such role in the structure under 
consideration. Thus the difference between the loads 
associated with the two structures i  XrA + XrR PLUs. 
Since the argument attachment structure is strongly 
preferred over the other structure, I hypothesize that 
this load is greater than P PLUs: 
(21) Xra + XTR > P 
Now consider the the well-known garden-path sen- 
tence in (22): 
(22) # The horse raced past the barn fell. 
The structure for the input the horse raced is am- 
biguous between at least the two structures in (23): 
(23) a. be bvp the horse \] \[vp raced \]\] 
b. bp Lvp the Lv, Lv, horse/\] \[cp Oi raced \] \]\] \] 
Structure (23a) has no load associated with it due 
to either the PTA or the PTR. Crucially note that the 
verb raced has an intransitive reading so that no load 
is required via the Property of Thematic Assignment. 
On the other hand, structure (23b) requires a load of 
2 ? xrR PLUs since 1) the noun phrase the horse is in a 
position that can receive a thematic role, but currently 
does not and 2) the operator Oi is in a position that 
may be associated with a thematic role, but is not yet 
sI will prefix sentences that are difficult to parse because 
of memory limitations with the symbol "#". Hence sen- 
tences that are unacceptable due to processing overload will 
be prefixed with "#", as will be garden-path sentences. 
associated with one. 9 Thus the difference between 
the processing loads of structures (23a) and (23b) is 
2 ? xrR PLUs. Since this sentence is a strong garden- 
path sentence, it is hypothesized that a load difference 
of 2 ? xrR PLUs is greater than the allowable limit, P 
PLUs: 
(24) 2 ? xrR > P 
A surprising effect occurs when a verb which op- 
tionally subcategorizes for a direct object, like race, is 
replaced by a verb which obligatorily subcategorizes 
for a direct object, likefind: 
(25) The bird found in the room was dead. 
Although the structures and local ambiguities in (25) 
and (22) are similar, (22) causes a garden-path effect 
while, surprisingly, (25) does not. To determine why 
(25) is not a garden-path sentence we need to examine 
the local ambiguity when the word found is read: 
(26) a. be Me the bird \] Ire Iv, Iv found \] \[He \] \]\]\] 
b. \[m Lvt, the ~, ~, bird/\] \[c/, Oi found \] \]\] \] 
The crucial difference between the verb found and 
the verb raced is that found requires a direct object, 
while raced does not. Since the 0-grid of the verb 
found is not filled in structure (26a), this representation 
is associated with xrA PLUs of memory load. Like 
structure (23b), structure (26b) requires 2 ? xrR PLUs. 
Thus the difference between the processing loads of 
structures (26a) and (26b) is 2 *xrR - XTA PLUs. Since 
no garden-path effect results in (25), I hypothesize that 
this load is less than or equal to P PLUs: 
(27) 2 * xrR - XTA <_ P 
Furthermore, these results correctly predict hat sen- 
tence (28) is not a garden-path sentence ither: 
(28) The bird found in the room enough debris to build 
a nest. 
Hence we have the following system of inequalities: 
(29) a. xrR < P 
b. XTA < P 
C. XTA "4-XTR > P 
d. 2*XTR > P 
e. 2 * XTR -- XrA < P 
This system of inequalities is consistent. Thus it 
identifies a particular solution space. This solution 
space is depicted by the shaded region in Figure 1. 
Note that, pretheoretically, there is no reason for 
this system of inequalities to be consistent. It could 
have been that the parser state of one of the example 
sentences forced an inequality that contradicted some 
previously obtained inequality. This situation would 
have had one of three implications: theproperties being 
considered might be incorrect; the properties being 
considered might be incomplete; or the whole approach 
9In fact, this operator will be associated with a thematic 
role as soon as a gap-positing algorithm links it with the 
object of the passive participle raced. However, when the 
attachment is initially made, no such link yet exists: the 
operator will initially be unassociated with a thematic role.

might be incorrect. Since this situation has not yet been 
observed, the results mutually support one another. 
4.1 A COMPARISON WITH SERIAL MODELS 
Because serial models of parsing can maintain at most 
one representation for any input string, they have dif- 
ficulty explaining the lack of garden-path effects in 
sentences like (10) and (25): 
(10) John expected Mary to like Fred. 
(25) The bird found in the room was dead. 
As a result of this difficulty Pritchett (1988) proposes 
the Theta Reanalysis Constraint:l? 
(30) Theta Reanalysis Constraint (TRC): Syntactic re- 
analysis which interprets a 0-marked constituent as 
outside its current 0-Domain and as within an exist- 
ing 0-Domain of which it is not a member is costly. 
(31) 0-Domain: c~ is in the 7 0-Domain of/3 iff c~ 
receives the 7 0-role from/3 or a is dominated by a 
constituent that receives the 3' 0-role from/3. 
As a result of the Theta Reanalysis Constraint, the 
necessary reanalysis in each of (10) and (25) is not 
expensive, so that no garden-path effect is predicted. 
Furthermore, the reanalysis in sentences like (22) and 
(19) violates the TRC, so that the garden-path effects 
are predicted. 
However, there are a number of empirical problems 
with Pritchett's theory. First of all, it turns out that the 
l?Frazier and Rayner (1982) make a similar stipulation to 
account for problems with the theory of Frazier and Fodor 
(1978). However, their account fails to explain the lack 
of garden-path effect in (25). See Pritcheu (1988) for a 
description of further problems with their analysis. 
Theta Reanalysis Constraint as defined in (30) incor- 
rectly predicts that the sentences in (32) do not induce 
garden-path effects: 
(32) a. # The horse raced past the barn was failing. 
b. # The dog walked to the park seemed small. 
c. # The boat floated own the river was a canoe. 
For example, consider (32a). When the auxiliary 
verb was is encountered, reanalysis is forced. How- 
ever, the auxiliary verb was does not have a thematic 
role to assign to its subject, the dog, so the TRC is not 
violated. Thus Pritchett's theory incorrectly predicts 
that these sentences do not cause garden-path effects. 
Other kinds of local ambiguity that do not give the 
human parser difficulty also pose a challenge to serial 
parsers. Marcus (1980) gives the sentences in (33) as 
evidence that any deterministic parser must be able to 
look ahead in the input string: 11 
(33) a. Have the boys taken the exam today? 
b. Have the boys take the exam today. 
Any serial parser must be able to account for the 
lack of difficulty with either of the sentences in (33). 
It turns out that the Theta Reanalysis Constraint does 
not help in cases like these: no matter which analysis 
is pursued first, reanalysis will violate the TRC. 
4.2 EMPIRICAL SUPPORT: FURTHER 
GARDEN-PATH EFFECTS 
Given the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Re- 
ception and their associated loads, we may now explain 
many more garden-path effects. Consider (34): 
(34) # The Russian women loved died. 
Up until the last word, this sentence is ambiguous 
between two readings: one where loved is the matrix 
verb; and the other where loved heads a relative clause 
modifier of the noun Russian. The strong preference 
for the matrix verb interpretation f the word loved 
can be easily explained if we examine the possible 
structures upon reading the word women: 
(35) a. \[u, \[we the Russian women\] 
b. \[u, \[We the IN, \[W, Russian/\] [cl, \[We Oi \] \[tP \[We 
women \] \]\] \]\] \] 
Structure (35a) requires xrR PLUs since the NP the 
Russian women needs but currently lacks a thematic 
role. Structure (35b), on the other hand, requires at 
least 3 ? xTR PLUs since 1) two noun phrases, the Rus- 
sian and women, need but currently lack thematic roles; 
and 2) the operator in the specifier position of the mod- 
ifying Comp phrase can be associated with a thematic 
role, but currently is not linked to one. Since the dif- 
ference between these loads is 2 ? XTR, a garden-path 
effect results. 
Consider now (36): 
(36) # John told the man that Mary kissed that Bill saw 
Phil. 
11Note that model that I am proposing here is a parallel 
model, and therefore isnondeterministic. 
44 
When parsing sentence (36), people will initially 
analyze the CP that Mary kissed unambiguously as
an argument of the verb told. It turns out that this 
hypothesis i  incompatible with the rest of the sentence, 
so that a garden-path effect results. In order to see how 
the garden-path effect comes about, consider the parse 
state which occurs after the word Mary is read: 
(37) a. \[tp ~P John \] Ice Iv, Iv told \] \[wp the man \] \[cp 
that \] be ~P Mary \] \]\] \]\]\] 
b. bp \[We John \] \[vp \[v, \[v told \] \[wp the \[W, \[W, 
man/\] \[cp bvp O/\] that bp bvp Mary \] \]\] \]\]7 
Structure (37a) requires no load by the PTA since 
the 0-grid of the only 0-assigner is filled with struc- 
tures that each contain thematic elements. However, 
the noun phrase Mary requires XrR PLUs by the Prop- 
erty of Thematic Reception since this NP is in a the- 
matic position but does not yet receive athematic role. 
Thus the total load associated with structure (37a) is 
xrR PLUs. Structure (37b), on the other hand, requires 
a load OfXTA +2*XTR since 1) the thematic role PROPOSI- 
TION is not yet assigned by the verb told; 2) the operator 
in the specifier position of the CP headed by that is not 
linked to a thematic role; and 3) the NP Mary is in 
thematic position but does not receive a thematic role 
yet. Thus the load difference isxrA +XrR PLUs, enough 
for the more expensive one to be dropped. Thus only 
structure (37a) is maintained and a garden-path effect 
eventually results, since this structure is not compati- 
ble with the entire sentence. Hence the Properties of 
Thematic Assignment and Reception make the correct 
predictions with respect to (36). 
Consider the garden-path sentence in (38): 
(38) # John gave the boy the dog bit a dollar. 
This sentence causes a garden-path effect since the 
noun phrase the dog is initially analyzed as the direct 
object of the verb gave rather than as the subject of a 
relative clause modifier of the NP the boy. This garden- 
path can be explained in the same way as previous 
examples. Consider the state of the parse after the NP 
the dog has been processed: 
(39) a. be \[We John \] \[vP Iv, \[v gave \]\[Ne the boy \] \[W~, 
the dog 1\]\]\] 
b. \[u, ~t, John \] \[re \[v, \[v gave \] \[wp the \[N, \[W, 
boyi \] Ice \[we Oi\] be \[we the dog \] \]\] \[we \] 777\]7 
While structure (39a) requires no load at this stage, 
structure (39b) requires 2 ? xrR + XrA PLUs since 1) 
one thematic role has not yet been assigned by the verb 
gave; 2) the operator in the specifier position of the 
CP modifying boy is not linked to a thematic role; and 
3) the NP the dog is in a thematic position but does 
not yet receive a thematic role. Thus structure (39a) is 
strongly preferred and a garden-path effect results. 
The garden-path effect in (40) can also be easily 
explained in this framework: 
(40) # The editor authors the newspaper hired liked 
laughed. 
Consider the state of the parse of (40) after the word 
authors has been read: 
(41) a. \[o, bop the editor \] \[w, Iv, Iv authors \] bee \] \]\]\] 
b. \[n, ~e the be, be, editor/\] \[cp Lvp Oi \] \[11, Me 
authors \] \]\] \]\]\] 
The word authors is ambiguous between ominal 
and verbal interpretations. The structure including the 
verbal reading is associated with XrA PLUs since the 
0-grid for the verb authors includes an unassigned role. 
Structure (41b), on the other hand, includes three 
noun phrases, each of which is in a position that may 
be linked to a thematic role but currently is not linked 
to any 0-role. Thus the load associated with structure 
(41b) is 3 ? XrR PLUs. Since the difference between 
the loads associated with structures (41b) and (41a) is 
so high (3 ? XrR -- XTA PLUs), only the inexpensive 
structure, structure (41a), is maintained. 
5 PROCESSING OVERLOAD 
The Properties of Thematic Assignment and Recep- 
tion also give a plausible account of the unacceptability 
of sentences with an abundance of center-embedding. 
Recall that I assume that a sentence is unacceptable 
because of short term memory overload if the com- 
bination of memory associated with properties of the 
structures built at some stage of the parse of the sen- 
tence is greater than the allowable processing load K. 
Consider (42): 
(42) # The man that the woman that the dog bit likes 
eats fish. 
Having input the noun phrase the dog the structure 
for the partial sentence is as follows: 
(43) \[o, \[top the \[to, \[/?, mani \] \[o, ~p Oi \] that \[tP \[s,P 
the \[~, ~, womanj \] \[cP \[NP Oj \] that \[lP \[NP the dog \] 
\]\]\] 
In this representation there are three lexical noun 
phrases that need thematic roles but lack them. Fur- 
thermore, there are two non-lexical NPs, operators, that 
are in positions that may prospectively be linked to 
thematic roles. Thus, under my assumptions, the load 
associated with this representation is at least 5 ? xrR 
PLUs. I assume that these properties are responsible 
for the unacceptability of this sentence, resulting in the 
inequality in (44): 
(44) 5 * xTR > K 
Note that sentences with only one relative clause 
modifying the subject are acceptable, asis exemplified 
in (45) 
(45) The man that the woman likes eats fish. 
Since (45) is acceptable, its load is below the max- 
imum at all stages of its processing. After processing 
the noun phrase the woman in (45), there are three noun 
phrases that currently lack 0-roles but may be linked to 
0-roles as future input appears. Thus we arrive at the 
inequality in (46): 
(46) 3 ? XTR <_ K 
45 
Thus I assume that the maximum processing load 
that people can handle lies somewhere above 3 ? xrR 
PLUs but somewhere below 5 ? xrR PLUs. Although 
these data are only suggestive, they clearly make the 
right kinds of predictions. Future research should es- 
tablish the boundary between acceptability and unac- 
ceptability more precisely. 
6 CONCLUSIONS 
Since the structural properties that are used in the for- 
marion of the inequalities are independently motivated, 
and the system of inequalities i solvable, the theory 
of human sentence processing presented here makes 
strong, testable predictions with respect to the process- 
ability of a given sentence. Furthermore, the success of 
the method provides empirical support for the particu- 
lar properties used in the formation of the inequalities. 
Thus a theory of PLUs, the preference factor P and 
the overload factor K provides a unified account of 1) 
acceptability and relative acceptability; 2)garden-path 
effects; and 3) preferred readings for ambiguous input.
