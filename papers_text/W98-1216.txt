This paper explores the use of weighted cusums, a 
technique found in authorship attribution studies, for 
the purpose of identifying sublanguages. The tech- 
nique, and its relation to standard cusums (cumulative 
sum charts) is first described, and the formulae for 
calculations given in detail. The technique compares 
texts by testing for the incidence of linguistic 'features' 
of a superficial nature, e.g. proportion of 2- and 
3---letter words, words beginning with a vowel, and. so 
on, and measures whether two texts differ significantly 
in respect of these features. The paper describes an 
experiment inwhich 14 groups of three texts each repre- 
senting different sublanguages are compared with each 
other using the technique. The texts are first compared 
within each group to establish that the technique can 
identify the groups as being homogeneous. The texts 
are then compared with each other, and the results 
analysed. Taking the average of seven different ests, 
the technique is able to distinguish the sublanguages in 
only 43% of the case. But if the best score is taken, 
79% of pairings can be distinguished. This is a better 
result, and the test seems able to quantify the difference 
between sublanguages. 
Keywords: sublanguage, genre, register, weighted 
cusum. 
1 Introduction 
This paper concerns a technique which we use to 
measure whether two texts are representative of the 
same text genre or sublanguage. It is very much in the 
spirit of the well-known work in this field by Douglas 
Biber (1988, 1990, 1995), but differs crucially in that 
we avoid the explicit selection of linguistic features 
thought a priori likely to be important in distinguishing 
sublangnages, and instead use a set of low-level features 
based on trivial aspects of the words such as length 
and initial letter. Our technique is borrowed from 
the neighbouring field of authorship attribution (for 
an overview of this field see Ule 1982; Smith 1982; 
Potter 1991; Burrows 1992; Holmes 1994). It is a 
straightforward calculation, simple to implement, and 
very general in application. It can be used with 
fairly small texts. This paper describes an experiment 
to see whether the technique can be used for the 
sublanguage identification task, even though it was 
originally designed for a somewhat different problem. 
In Somers (forthcoming), we used a technique 
called 'weighted cusums' to investigate how well a 
parody of Lewis Carroll had imitated his style. Look- 
hag also at other writings by Carroll, including his 
'serious' mathematical works (under his real name, 
Charles Dodgson), letters to adults and children, his 
diaries, formal and whimsical articles in newspapers, 
we found that the technique, although unable to identify 
Carroll/Dodgson as the unique author of all the texts, as 
the authorship attribution literature would demand and 
expect, seemed to be able to group together his writings 
according to genre and/or topic. This was an interesting 
finding, because the technique, as has already been 
hinted, measures the most banal of linguistic features. 
This finding suggested to us the idea of the experiment 
reported ha this paper: could the technique be used to 
identify sublanguages? 
2 Background 
2.1 Sublanguage 
We will assume that readers of this paper are fairly fa- 
miliar with the literature on sublanguage ( .g. Kittredge 
& Lehrberger 1982; Grishman & Kittredge 1986), 
including definitions of the notion, history of the basic 
idea, and, above all, why it is a useful concept. Some 
readers will prefer terms like 'register' (which Biber 
uses); an affinity with work on genre detection will also 
be apparent. Because there is sometimes some dispute 
about the use of the term 'sublanguage', let us clarify 
from the start that for our purposes a sublanguage is
an identifiable genre or text-type in a given subject 
field, with a relatively or even absolutely closed set of 
syntactic structures and vocabulary. In recent years, 
the availability of large corpora and 'new' methods 
to process them have led to renewed interest in the 
question of sublanguage identification (e.g. Sekine 
1997), while Karlgren & Cutting (1994) and Kessler 
et al (1997) have focussed on the narrower but clearly 
related questio.n of genre. 
Our purpose in this paper is to explore a technique 
for identifying whether a set of texts 'belong to' the

Harold Somers (1998) An Attempt to Use Weighted Cusums to Identify Sublanguages. In D.M.W. Powers (ed.) 
NeMLaP3/CoNLL 98 : New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, ACL, pp 131-139. 
same sublanguage, and of quantifying the difference 
between texts: our technique compares texts palrwise 
and delivers a 'score' which can be used to group texts 
judged similar by the technique. As we shall see later, 
what is of interest here is that the score is derived 
from a simple count of linguistic features uch as word 
length and whether words begin with a vowel; yet 
this apparently unpromising approach seems to deliver 
usable results. 
In his well-known study, Biber (1988) took a 
number of potentially distinct ext genres and measured 
the incidence of 67 different linguistic features in 
the texts to see what correlation there was between 
genre and linguistic feature. He also performed factor 
analysis on the features to see how they could be 
grouped, and thereby see if sublanguages could be 
defined in terms of these factors. 
The linguistic features that Biber used I are a 
mixture of lexical and syntactic ones, and almost all 
require a quite sophisticated level of analysis of the 
text data - dictionary look-up, tagging, a parser. They 
are presumably also, it should be said, hand-picked as 
features whose use might differ significantly from one 
genre to another. Although Biber gives details of the 
algorithms used to extract he features, it is not a trivial 
matter to replicate his experiments. 
Kessler et al (1997) make the same criticism of 
Biber and of Karlgren & Cutting (1994), and restrict 
their experimentation genre recognition to "surface 
cues". In their paper they do not give any detail 
about the cues they use, except to say that they are 
"mainly punctuation cues and other separators and 
delimiters used to mark text categories like phrases, 
clauses, and sentences" (p. 34); however, Hinrich 
Schfitze (personal eornmunication) has elaborated that 
"The cues are punctuation, non-content words (pro- 
nouns, prepositions, auxiliaries), counts of words, \[of\] 
unique words, \[of\] sentences, and \[of\] characters; and 
deviation features (standard eviation of word length 
and sentence length)". As we shall see below, the use 
of superficial linguistic aspects of the text is a feature 
of the approach described here. 
2.2 Authorship attribution and weighted eusums 
Authorship attribution has for a long time been a 
significant part of literary stylistics, familiar even to 
lay people in questions uch as "Did Shakespeare ally 
write all of his plays?", "Who wrote the Bible?", and 
I The features can be grouped into "sixteen major categories: (A) 
tense and aspect markers, (B) place and time adverbials, (C) pronouns 
and pro-verbs, (D) questions, (E) nominal forms, (F) passives, ((3) 
stative forms, (H) subordination features, (I) adjectives and adverbs, 
(J) lexical specificity, (K) specialized lexical classes, (L) medals, 
(M) specialized verb classes, (hi) reduced or dispreferred forms, (O) 
coordination, and (P) negation." (Biber 1988:223) 
so on. With the advent of computers, this once rather 
subjective field of study has become more rigorous, 
attracting also the attention of statisticians, o that now 
the field of 'stylometrics' - the objective measurement 
of (aspects) of literary style - has become a precise 
and technical science. 
One technique that has been used in authorship 
attribution studies, though not without controversy, is
the cumulative sum chart ('cusum') technique, a variant 
of which: we shall be using for our own investigation. 
Since we" are not actually using standard cusums here, 
our explanation can be relatively brief. Cusums are 
a fairly well-known statistical device used in process 
control. The technique was adapted for author identifi- 
cation by Morton (1978) - see also Farringdon (1996) 
- and achieved some notoriety for its use in court cases 
(e.g. to identify faked or coerced confessions) as well as 
in literary studies. The technique is easy to implement, 
and requires only small mounts of text. 
A cusum is a graphic plot based on a sequence 
of measures. For example, suppose we have a set 
of measures (11,7,4, 10,2 . . . .  ) with a mean value of 
6. The corresponding divergences from the mean 
are (5 ,1 , -2 ,4 , -4 , . . . ) .  The cusum chart plots 
not these divergences, but their aggregate sum, i.e. 
(5, 6, 4, 8, 4, . . . ) ,  the sequence inevitably ending in 0. 
The plot reflects the variability of the measure: the 
straighter the line, the more stable the measure. In 
authorship attribution studies, the eusum chart is used 
to plot the homogeneity of a text with respect to a 
linguistic 'feature' such as use of two- and three-letter 
words on a sentence-by-sentence basis. Two graphs 
are plotted, one for the sentence lengths, the other for 
the incidence of the feature, and superimposed after 
scaling so that they cover roughly the same range. The 
authorship identification technique involves taking the 
texts in question, concatenating them, and then plotting 
the eusum chart. I f  the authors differ in their use of 
the linguistic feature chosen, this will manifest itself 
as a marked divergence in the two plots at or near the 
point(s) where the texts have been joined. 
There are a number of drawbacks with this 
method, the main one being the manner in which 
the result of the test is arrived at, namely the need to 
scrutinize the plot and use one's skill and experience 
(i.e. subjective judgment) to determine whether there 
is a "significant discrepancy" at or near the join point 
in the plot. 
A solution to this and several other problems with 
the standard cusum technique is offered by Hilton & 
Holmes (1993) and Bissell (1995a,b) in the form of 
weighted cusums (henceforth WQsums). Since this is 
the technique we shall use for our experiments, we need 
to describe it in full detail.

3 Weighted cusums 
3.1 The calculations 
As in the standard cusum, the WQsum is a measure 
of the variation and homogeneity of use of a linguistic 
feature on a sentence-by-sentence basis throughout a
text. It captures not only the relative amount of use of  
the feature, but also whether its use is spread evenly 
throughout the texts in question. 
In a WQsum, instead of summing the divergence 
from the mean wi - ~ for the sentence lengths w and 
similarly xi-?" for the linguistic feature x, we sum x i -  
~'wi, where /r, the 'weight', is the overall proportion 
of feature words in the whole text, as given by (I). 
As Hilton & Holmes (1993) explain, this weighting 
means that we are calculating "the cumulative sum of 
the difference between the observed number of feature 
occurrences and the 'expected' number of occurrences" 
(p. 75). 
~_  E~i  (1) 
As we shall see shortly, the variation in a WQsum 
can be measured systematically, and its statistical sig- 
nificance quantified with something like a t-test. This 
means that visual inspection of the WQsum plot is not 
necessary. There is no need, either, to concatenate or
sandwich the texts to be compared. For the t-test, the 
two texts, .4 and B, are treated as separate samples. 
The formula for t is (2). 
t = I~rA -- ~'S\[ (2) 
The t-value is, in the words of Hilton & Holmes, "a ? 
measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis 
that the frequency of usage of the habit \[i.e. linguistic 
feature\] under consideration is the same in Text A 
and Text B. The higher the t-value, the more evidence 
against he hypothesis" (.p. 76). The formula chosen 
for the calculation of variance e in (2) is given in (3), 
where n is the number of sentences in the text. 
The resulting value is looked up in a standard t- 
table, which will tell us how confidently we can assert 
that the difference is significant. For this we need to 
know the degrees of freedom v, which depends on the 
number of sentences in the respective t xts, and is given 
by (4). Tradition suggests that p < .05 is the minimum 
acceptable confidence level, i.e. the probability is less 
than 5% that the differences between the texts are due 
to chance. 
v = nA + nB - 2 (4) 
3.2 The linguistic features 
A point of interest for us is that both the cusums and 
WQsums have been used in the stylometrics field to 
measure the incidence of linguistically banal features, 
easily measured and counted. The linguistic features 
proposed by Farringdon (1996:25), and used in this 
experiment, involve the number of words of a given 
length, and/or beginning with a vowel, as listed in Table 
1. 
Table 1 Linguistic features 
identified by Farringdon (1996:25). 
Habit Abbreviation 
Two- and three-letter words Iw23 
Two-, three- and four-letter words 1w234 
Three- and four-letter words lw34 
Initial-vowel words vowel 
Two- and three-letter words or lw23v 
initial-vowel words 
Two-, three- and four-letter words or lw234v 
initial-vowel words 
Three- and four-letter words or lw34v 
initial-vowel words 
Other experimemers have suggested counting the 
number of nouns and other parts of speech, but it is 
not clear if there are any limitations on the linguistic 
features that could be used for this test, except the obvi- 
ous one that the feature should in principle be roughly 
correlated with sentence length. In any case, part of 
the attraction for our experiment is that the features are 
so fundamentally different from the linguistic features 
used by Biber in his experiments, and so will offer a 
point of comparison. Furthermore, they are easy to 
compute and involve no overheads (lexicons, parsers 
etc.) whatsoever. 
It is also interesting to note that the WQsum is a 
measure of  variation, a type of metric which, according 
to Kessler et al (1997) has not previously used in this 
type of study. 
In authorship identification, it is necessary first 
to determine which of these features is "distinctive" 
for a given author, and then to test the documents in 
question for that feature. This is not appropriate for our 
sublanguage experiment, so for each text comparison 
we run all seven tests. Each test gives us a t-score from 
which a confidence l vel can be determined. Obviously, 
the result over the seven tests may vary somewhat. 
For our experiment we simply take the average of the 
seven t-scores as the result of text comparison. It 
Somers 133 Use Weighted Cusums to Idenn'fy Sublanguages 
is not obvious that it makes sense any more to treat 
this as a t-score, and in the experiments described 
below we tend to treat it as a raw score, a lower 
score indicating cohesion, a higher score suggesting 
difference. Nevertheless it is useful to bear in mind 
that, given the degrees of freedom involved in all eases 
(the texts are all roughly the same length), the threshold 
for siguifieance is around 1.65. 
4 The method 
Our experiment is to use the WQsum test on a corpus of  
small texts which we believe can be grouped according 
to genre or sublanguage. We gathered 15 sets of 
different ext-types: each set of three texts is assumed 
to represent a different sublanguage, and each text was 
written, as far as we know, by a different author. The 
15 groups of texts were as follows: 
blurbs publishers' announcements of scientific text- 
books 
BMJ abstracts of articles appearing in the British 
Medical Journal 
childrcns extracts from children's tories 
church articles from local Catholic church newsletters 
economy economic reports from a Swiss bank 
e-mails discussing arrangement of a meeting 
footie reports of soccer matches from the same news- 
paper, same date 
lawreps extracts from The Weekly Law Reports 
obits obituaries of Jacques Cousteau, from different 
newspapers 
recipes recipes from the Interact Chef web site 
TVscripts Autocue scripts from Central TV News 
programmes 
tourism extracts from the "Shopping" seetiorL of 
Berlitz guides 
univs descriptions of  Computer Science courses 
weather state-wide general weather forecasts from US 
National Weather Service 
xwords sets of  clues to cryptic crosswords 
Our first task is to see that the WQsum test can 
confirm the homogeneity of the text triplets. For each 
group of three texts, we ran our test and averaged the 
t-scores for each group. Table 2 shows an example of  
this for the "church' group of texts. Table 3 lists the 14 
groups together with some information about the texts, 
including their 'homogeneity score', an indication of 
their length (average number of sentences, and average 
words per sentence), and their source. 
The first thing to note is that all the groups of  
texts are well within the 1.65 threshold of significant 
difference. In other words, the pairwise WQsum test 
for each group firmly indicates homogeneity within the 
groups.

We now proceed to compare all the texts with 
each other, pairwise. It is fortunate that the WQsum 
procedure is so simple, since this pairwise comparison 
involves a huge number of iterations: each text com- 
parison involves even applications of the WQsum test, 
each group comparison i volves nine text comparisons, 
and there are 105 pairwise group comparisons, making 
a total of 6615 tests. In the following section we will 
attempt to summarize the findings to be had from this 
large body of data. 
5 Results 
The full results of the comparison are given in Table 4. 
This table shows the pairwise average t-scores, repli- 
cated for ease of consultation. The groups are ordered 
as in Table 3, so that results in the top left-hand comer

of the table are between the most homogeneous groups, 
results in the bottom right the least homogeneous. The 
scores given on the diagonal are repeated from Table 3 
and show the average score for the internal comparison 
of the texts in that group. 
This time we are looking for high scores to 
support he hypothesis that the WQsum test can identify 
the texts as belonging to different sublanguages. At first 
glance the results look disappointing. If we again take 
a score of  1.65 as the notional cut-off point, then only 
43% (45 out of 105) of the results qualify. On the 
other hand, if we compare the scores with those for the 
group-internal comparisons (Table 3), we may view the 
results more positively. The average internal score was 
0.885 (s.d. = 0.232), the worst score 1.175; 67% of our 
scores are better than that. 
One problem stems from averaging the scores 
for all the tests. When the WQsum test is used in 
authorship attribution, it is necessary first to determine 
which linguistic feature is significant for the author 
under investigation. Looking at the raw scores for our 
experiment, we see that very often consistently high 
scores with one test are undermined by low scores on 
others. Table 5 shows an example of this, where an 
average score of 2.197 on the '1w34' test is mitigated by 
insignificant scores on the other test, giving an overall 
average of 1.074.

So an alternative that suggests itself is to take 
in each case the highest of the average scores for each 
linguistic feature, on a pairwise basis. These alternative 
results are presented in Table 6, which also shows in 
each ease which linguistic feature gave the best result. 
Since we are now taking the highest rather than the 
average score for the pairwise comparisons, we should 
also take the highest score for within-group comparison, 
which is again shown on the diagonal. As in Table 4, 
the groups are ordered from 'best' to 'worst' within- 
group score. 
The 'improvement' in the results is considerable: 
this time 82 of the 105 results (78%) are above the 
1.650 threshold. However, taking the highest rather 
than the average score for the within-groups comparison 
leaves four of the groups -  'TVseripts', 'recipes', 
'tourism' and 'childrens' m with scores above the 1.65 
threshold, and a fifth group, 'weather', has a score very 
close to this. The scores for these groups are otten high 
for comparisons with other texts, but they are also high 
for the within-group comparison: this suggests that the 
texts in these groups are not homogeneous, so we have 
to take this into account when we consider the results 
in the discussion that follows. 
6 Discussion 
6.1 Does the WQsum test identify 
different sublanguages? 
Let us consider first the results as shown in Table 6. 
Our main concern of course is to see whether the 
WQsurn test can identify and distinguish the groups. 
Taking 1.65 as our threshold, we can rank the groups 
according to the number of other groups with which 
each gets a pairwise score average above this threshold. 
In addition, since the 'ideal' situation as far as our 
hypothesis goes would be for a low within-group aver- 
age score suggesting homogeneity, and a high average 
score for comparisons with other groups, suggesting 
distinctiveness, as a further, informal measure of the 
extent to which the groups meet this condition, we 
can divide the average comparison score by the within- 
group score. Table 7 shows a ranking of the groups 
along these lines. 
The groups eem to divide into roughly four types. 
The first type, groups which support our hypothesis 
the best, have a low within-group average, a high 
pairwise average, and can easily be distinguished from 
most of  the other groups. In this group are 'xwords', 
'univs', 'blurbs', 'BMJ', and 'economy'. At the other 
end of the scale, at the bottom of Table 7, are those 
groups which can have a low 'Sig.' score. This group 
is not necessarily marked by a low pairwise average 
or a high within-group score: the 'obits' group for 
example has the second lowest within-group average, 
and scores quite highly on our informal ratio score. Yet 
the WQsum test cannot distinguish it from six of the 
other groups. 
A third type is where the 'Sig.' score is high 
despite a high within-group average which would sug- 
gest lack of homogeneity. The 'recipes' group, for 
example, stands out as a distinct sublanguage, with 
highly significant scores compared to all other groups. 
Despite the fact that the within-group score is above the

Table 7 The 15 groups ranked first according to total of 
pairwise averages above the 1.65 threshold ('Sig.'), 
and secondly according to the informal score 
described in the text. An asterisk indicates a group where 
the within-group average isabove the 1.65 threshold.

1.65 threshold, suggesting lack of homogeneity among 
the recipes, the average of the scores for pairwise 
comparisons with other groups is sufficiently high to 
compensate this: as Table 6 shows, the average scores 
for recipes are consistently high, and ot~en the highest 
in any row. This can be contrasted with the case of 
the 'church' group, where the within-group average is 
below the 1.65 threshold, but so are nearly half the 
scores for pairwise comparisons. But the situation can 
also be contrasted with the 'TVseripts' and 'childrens' 
groups: pairwise scores with all the other grofaps 
indicate significant differences, but so does the within- 
group average. This means that each TV script or 
children's story seems significantly different from all 
the other samples, including the other TV scripts or 
children's stories. For the 'tourism' group, too, the 
scores for pairwise comparison are about the same as 
the within-group score. It so happens that these scores 
are a bit nearer the threshold, so we get a 10-4 'Sig.' 
score rather than 14--0, but the conclusion is the same: 
the WQsum earmot distinguish these sublanguages. 
Finally we have the case of the 'lawreps' and 
'emails', which are internally homogenous, and can be 
distinguished from some, but not all of the other groups. 
Let us now summarize these observations, and 
categorize the four types: 
A Good result. Homogeneous and distinctive sub- 
language: 'xwords', 'univs', 'blurbs', 'BMJ', and 
'economy'. 
Somers 138 
B1 Distinctive sublanguage though internally less ho- 
mogeneous: 'recipes' 
B2 Coherent sublanguage though not always distinc- 
tive: 'lawreps', 'emails' 
C Distinctive but not coherent: 'TVscripts', 'chil- 
drens' 
D Not distinguishable from other groups: "obits', 
'tourism', 'footie', 'church', 'weather' 
Not surprisingly, if we look at an ordered list of 
the individual pairwise scores, we find that the worst 
scores (Table 8) are mostly between the groups of type 
Bz and D.

This suggests that the WQsum test is able to 
quantify the similarity of individual groups, as well as 
to distinguish sublanguages. In this experiment we have 
taken groups of texts and compared them, but in fact 
the WQsum algorithm is designed to work on the basis 
of  individual texts. In principle, we could simply take 
a pair of texts and use the algorithm to determine to 
what extent they are the same sublanguage. It must 
be said however that it seems to make more sense to 
use the test in the comparative manner illustrated here, 
for example comparing three texts to see which pair is 
most similar. It also seems important to have a baseline 
score for an established group of texts belonging to the 
same sublanguage. 
6.2 Reservations and future directions 
A very short time before the final version of this paper 
was due to be delivered, a further possibility came 
to our notice. Tweedie & Donnelly (1996) describe 
an alternative, multivariate st using weighted eusurns 
to compare more than two texts. Although we have 
not had a chance to study this proposal, it claims to 
give more accurate results than the pairwise application 
of the WQsum formula that has been reported in this 
paper. An obvious next step is to try their proposal. 
Also, a further step that we might ake would be to 
answer the criticism that the scale of our investigation 
is too small. The fact that we have taken only three 25- 
sentence samples of each sublanguage obviously means

that our conclusions must be somewhat limited. An 
anonymous reviewer commented that "the texts were so 
different, that it shouldn't be hard at all to discriminate 
between them". The results in Tables 4 and 6 show 
that this is not the ease at all: the groups that the test 
failed to distinguish are not necessarily those which to 
the human eye are most similar (see Table 8), nor are 
the successfully identified groups necessarily the most 
dissimilar. Perhaps this finding is not so surprising 
when we consider that the linguistic features that are 
used in the test are so superficial: there is no reason 
to expect that the incidence of words beginning with 
a vowel, for example, would correlate highly with 
sublanguage type. And therein lies the real interest 
of this technique: because the linguistic features are 
superficial, it seems that there is no intuition that we 
can appeal to here. 
Finally, throughout this paper we have referred 
to 'sublanguage', and the possibility that bur WQsum 
algorithm can identify different sublanguages. It seems 
that the algorithm can distinguish texts, but it is by 
no means clear what aspect of their difference it is 
capturing. It could for example be merely genre, or 
some other aspect of sublanguage, that it is capturing 
though again intuitions are difficult to appeal to because 
of the superficiality of the linguistic features used. We 
need to look more closely at the differences between 
the text pairs it fails to distinguish and those where it 
succeeds, in order to try to get a feel for what, exactly, 
the test is capturing. Nevertheless, we feel that it is an 
interesting avenue to explore, the more so as it seems to 
be quite unlike the other methods described in this field.
