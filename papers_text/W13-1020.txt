Abstract
Multiword expressions as they appear as nominal
compounds, collocational forms, and idioms are
now leveraged in educational technology in assess-
ment and instruction contexts. The talk will focus on
how multiword expression identification is used in
different kinds of educational applications, includ-
ing automated essay evaluation, and teacher pro-
fessional development in curriculum development
for English language learners. Recent approaches
developed to resolve polarity for noun-noun com-
pounds in a sentiment system being designed to han-
dle evaluation of argumentation (sentiment) in test-
taker writing (Beigman-Klebanov, Burstein, and
Madnani, to appear) will also be described.
