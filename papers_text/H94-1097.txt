PROJECT GOALS 
The primary long term goal of speech research at Dragon 
Systems is to develop algorithms that are capable of 
achieving very high performance large vocabulary con- 
tinuous speech recognition. At the same time, we are 
also concerned to keep the demands of those algorithms 
for computational power and memory as modest as pos- 
sible, so that the results of our research can be incorpo- 
rated into products that will run on moderately priced 
personal computers. 
RECENT RESULTS 
This past year's effort has been devoted to further work 
on speaker independent training and recognition, as well 
as to the problem of adapting to new speakers and new 
microphones. Important projects in the past year have 
included the incorporation of a trigram language model 
into the forward pass, the use of phonetically tied mix- 
ture models, studies in adaptation, and experiments in- 
volving time resolution issues including the effects of the 
frame rate, the number of nodes per triphone model, and 
the skipping of nodes. 
We implemented our trigram language model in the for- 
ward pass of our time synchronous decoder. This was 
done in an attempt o avoid the search errors being re- 
ported at the last HLT meeting when using them only 
in the final pass of a multipass algorithm. This archi- 
tecture, however, required much more memory than a 
multipass implementation. As a result, we hit against 
the memory limitations of our machines while we still 
had a significant percentage of search errors. In spite 
of this, we obtained a substantiM reduction in the er- 
ror rate with trigrams. We also developed our own code 
for constructing trigram language models from a body 
of training text. 
Our experiments with phonetically tied mixture mod- 
els showed that these models appear to have an ad- 
vantage over ordinary tied mixture models in terms of 
their speaker independent recognition performance as

well as in the area of speaker and microphone adaptation. 
By adapting the phonetically specific basis distributions, 
one can, in essence, obtain phonetically specific nonpara- 
metric transformations of acoustic space so as to quickly 
capture important speaker or microphone characteris- 
tics and correct for them. In addition, phonetically tied 
mixture models generally require less memory since they 
tend to need fewer components per mixture. 
Unlike most other sites, Dragon continues to favor the 
use of 20 ms frames over that of 10 ms frames. Our 
recent experiments indicate that as long as we retain the 
ability to skip nodes in our triphone models, there is 
little advantage to the faster frame rate. We also have 
generally found that there is an advantage to allowing 
the number of nodes to be variable across triphones. The 
use of as many as 5 nodes per triphone has been found 
to be useful for some contexts of some phonemes. 
A number of attempts to improve the signal processing 
of our system led to negative results. We have not yet 
obtained any benefit from the use of second difference 
parameters, nor did we obtain any advantage from the 
application of linear discriminant analysis to a series of 
concatenated frames. On the other hand, we did find 
that it was important for us to use gender dependent 
linear discriminant based transformations. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
We intend to explore the use of decision trees and gen- 
eral mixture models. In addition we hope to compare the 
value of full Baum-Welch training to that of the method 
we currently use, which relies on explicit phoneme align- 
ments. Multipass algorithms will also be implemented, 
as a vehicle for a more efficient implementation of tri- 
grams and other longer context language models, as well 
as for speeding up the recognizer. Since the phoneme 
alignments off of which we build our models do not cor- 
respond as closely to human judgement as we might 
have expected, we plan to explore the question of how 
difference parameters may influence alignments, espe- 
cially when mediated through linear discriminant analy- 
sis based transformations.
