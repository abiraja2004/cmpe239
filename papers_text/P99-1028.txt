Abstract 
This paper deals with translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy problems together. Two 
monolingual balanced corpora are employed to 
learn word co-occurrence for translation 
ambiguity resolution, and augmented translation 
restrictions for target polysemy resolution. 
Experiments show that the model achieves 
62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and 
is 40.80% addition to the select-all model. 
Combining the target polysemy resolution, the 
retrieval performance is about 10.11% increase to 
the model resolving translation ambiguity only. 
1. Introduction 
Cross language information retrieval (CLIR) 
(Oard and Dorr, 1996; Oard, 1997) deals with the 
use of queries in one language to access 
documents in another. Due to the differences 
between source and target languages, query 
translation is usually employed to unify the 
language in queries and documents. In query 
translation, translation ambiguity is a basic 
problem to be resolved. A word in a source 
query may have more than one sense. Word 
sense disambiguation identifies the correct sense 
of each source word, and lexical selection 
translates it into the corresponding target word. 
The above procedure is similar to lexical choice 
operation in a traditional machine translation (MT) 
system. However, there is a significant 
difference between the applications of MT and 
CLIR. In MT, readers interpret he translated 
results. If the target word has more than one 
sense, readers can disambiguate its meaning 
automatically. Comparatively, the translated 
result is sent to a monolingual information 
retrieval system in CLIR. The target polysemy 
adds extraneous senses and affects the retrieval 
performance. 
Some different approaches have been proposed 
for query translation. Dictionary-based approach 
exploits machine-readable dictionaries and 
selection strategies like select all (Hull and 
Grefenstette, 1996; Davis, 1997), randomly select 
N (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Kwok 1997) and 
select best N (Hayashi, Kikui and Susaki, 1997; 
Davis 1997). Corpus-based approaches exploit 
sentence-aligned corpora (Davis and Dunning, 
1996) and document-aligned corpora (Sheridan 
and Ballerini, 1996). These two approaches are 
complementary. Dictionary provides translation 
candidates, and corpus provides context to fit user 
intention. Coverage of dictionaries, alignment 
performance and domain shift of corpus are major 
problems of these two approaches. Hybrid 
approaches (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Bian and 
Chen, 1998; Davis 1997) integrate both lexical 
and corpus knowledge. 
All the above approaches deal with the 
translation ambiguity problem in query translation. 
Few touch on translation ambiguity and target 
polysemy together. This paper will study the 
multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy in cross-language information 
retrieval systems, and propose a new translation 
method to resolve these problems. Section 2 
shows the effects of translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy in Chinese-English and English- 
Chinese information retrievals. Section 3 
presents several models to revolve translation 
ambiguity and target polysemy problems. 
Section 4 demonstrates the experimental results, 
and compares the performances of the proposed 
models. Section 5 concludes the remarks. 
2. Effects of Ambiguities 
Translation ambiguity and target polysemy are 
two major problems in CLIR. Translation 
ambiguity results from the source language, and 
target polysemy occurs in target language. Take 
Chinese-English information retrieval (CEIR) and 
English-Chinese information retrieval (ECIR) as 
examples. The former uses Chinese queries to 
215

retrieve English documents, while the later 
employs English queries to retrieve Chinese 
documents. To explore the difficulties in the 
query translation of different languages, we gather 
the sense statistics of English and Chinese words. 
Table 1 shows the degree of word sense ambiguity 
(in terms of number of senses) in English and in 
Chinese, respectively. A Chinese thesaurus, i.e., 
~~$~k (tong2yi4ci2ci21in2), (Mei, et al, 
1982) and an English thesaurus, i.e., Roget's 
thesaurus, are used to count the statistics of the 
senses of words. On the average, an English 
word has 1.687 senses, and a Chinese word has 
1.397 senses. If the top 1000 high frequent 
words are considered, the English words have 
3.527 senses, and the bi-character Chinese words 
only have 1.504 senses. In summary, Chinese 
word is comparatively unambiguous, so that 
translation ambiguity is not serious but target 
polysemy is serious in CEIR. In contrast, an 
English word is usually ambiguous. The 
translation disambiguation is important in ECIR. 
Consider an example in CEIR. The Chinese 
word ",~,It" (yin2hang2) is unambiguous, but its 
English translation "bank" has 9 senses (Longman, 
1978). When the Chinese word " ,~ 45- " 
(yin2hang2) is issued, it is translated into the 
English counterpart "bank" by dictionary lookup 
without difficulty, and then "bank" is sent o an IR 
system. The IR system will retrieve documents 
that contain this word. Because "bank" is not 
disambiguated, irrelevant documents will be 
reported. On the contrary, when "bank" is 
submitted to an ECIR system, we must 
disambiguate itsmeaning at first. If we can find 
that its correct ranslation is "-~g-#5"" (yin2hang2), 
the subsequent operation is very simple. That is, 
"~'~5-" (yin2hang2) is sent into an IR system, and 
then documents containing "~l~5"" (yin2hang2) 
will be presented. In this example, translation 
disambiguation should be done rather than target 
polysemy resolution. 
The above examples do not mean translation 
disambiguation is not required in CEIR. Some 
Chinese words may have more than one sense. 
For example, "k-~ ~ " (yun4dong4) has the 
following meanings (Lai and Lin, 1987): (1) sport, 
(2) exercise, (3) movement, (4) motion, (5) 
campaign, and (6) lobby. Each corresponding 
English word may have more than one sense. 
For example, "exercise" may mean a question or 
set of questions to be answered by a pupil for 
practice; the use of a power or right; and so on. 
The multiplication effects of translation ambiguity 
and target polysemy make query translation 
harder. 
3. Translation Ambiguity and Polysemy 
Resolution Models 
In the recent works, Ballesteros and Croft 
(1998), and Bian and Chen (1998) employ 
dictionaries and co-occurrence statistics trained 
from target language documents to deal with 
translation ambiguity. We will follow our 
previous work (Bian and Chen, 1998), which 
combines the dictionary-based and corpus-based 
approaches for CEIR. A bilingual dictionary 
provides the translation equivalents of each query 
term, and the word co-occurrence information 
trained from a target language text collection is 
used to disambiguate the translation. This 
method considers the content around the 
translation equivalents to decide the best target 
word. The translation of a query term can be 
disambiguated using the co-occurrence of the 
translation equivalents of this term and other 
terms. We adopt mutual information (Church, et 
al., 1989) to measure the strength. This 
disambiguation method performs good 
translations even when the multi-term phrases are 
not found in the bilingual dictionary, or the 
phrases are not identified in the source language. 
Before discussion, we take Chinese-English 
information retrieval as an example to explain our 
methods. Consider the Chinese query ",~I~'~5-" 
(yin2hang2) to an English collection again. The 
ambiguity grows from none (source side) to 9 
senses (target side) during query translation. 
How to incorporate the knowledge from source 
side to target side is an important issue. To 
avoid the problem of target polysemy in query 
216 
translation, we have to restrict he use of a target 
word by augmenting some other words that 
usually co-occur with it. That is, we have to 
make a context for the target word. In our 
method, the contextual information is derived 
from the source word. 
We collect the frequently accompanying nouns 
and verbs for each word in a Chinese corpus. 
Those words that co-occur with a given word 
within a window are selected. The word 
association strength of a word and its 
accompanying words is measured by mutual 
information. For each word C in a Chinese 
query, we augment i with a sequence of Chinese 
words trained in the above way. Let these words 
be CW~, CW2, ..., and CWm. Assume the 
corresponding English translations of C, CW~, 
CW2, ..., and CWm are E, EW,, EW2, ..., and EWm, 
respectively. EWe, EW2, ..., and EWm form an 
augmented translation restriction of E for C. In 
other words, the list (E, EW1, EW2, ..., EWm) is 
called an augmented translation result for C. 
EWe, EWe, ..., and EWm are a pseudo English 
context produced from Chinese side. Consider 
the Chinese word "~I~gS"" (yin2hang2). Some 
strongly co-related Chinese words in ROCLING 
balanced corpus (Huang, et al, 1995) are: "I!.g.~," 
(tie 1 xian4), "~ ~"  (ling3chu 1), "_-~_. ~"  (li3ang2), 
"~ 1~" (yalhui4), ";~ ~"  (hui4dui4), etc. Thus 
the augmented translation restriction of "bank" is 
(rebate, show out, Lyons, negotiate, transfer, ...). 
Unfortunately, the query translation is not so 
simple. A word C in a query Q may be 
ambiguous. Besides, the accompanying words 
CW~ (1 < i < m) trained from Chinese corpus may 
be translated into more than one English word. 
An augmented translation restriction may add 
erroneous patterns when a word in a restriction 
has more than one sense. Thus we devise several 
models to discuss the effects of augmented 
restrictions. Figure 1 shows the different models 
and the model refinement procedure. A Chinese 
query may go through translation ambiguity 
resolution module (left-to-right), target polysemy 
resolution module (top-down), or both (i.e., these 
two modules are integrated at the right corner). 
In the following, we will show how each module 
is operated independently, and how the two 
modules are combined. 
For a Chinese query which is composed of n 
words C~, C2, ..., Ca, find the corresponding 
English translation equivalents in a Chinese- 
English bilingual dictionary. To discuss the 
propagation errors from translation ambiguity 
resolution part in the experiments, we consider the 
following two alternatives: 
(a) select all (do-nothing) 
The strategy does nothing on the translation 
disambiguation. All the English translation 
equivalents for the n Chinese words are selected, 
and are submitted to a monolingual information 
retrieval system. 
(b) co-occurrence model (Co-Model) 
We adopt the strategy discussed previously 
for translation disambiguation (Bian and Chen, 
1998). This method considers the content 
around the English translation equivalents to 
decide the best target equivalent. 
For target polysemy resolution part in Figure 1, 
we also consider two alternatives. In the first 
alternative (called A model), we augment 
restrictions to all the words no matter whether 
they are ambiguous or not. In the second 
alternative (called U model), we neglect hose Cs 
that have more than one English translation. 
Assume Co~), C~2) .... , Co~p) (p < n) have only one 
English translation. The restrictions are 
augmented toCo~), C~2) ..... Co~p) only. We apply 
the above corpus-based method to find the 
restriction for each English word selected by the 
translation ambiguity resolution model. Recall 
that the restrictions are derived from Chinese 
corpus. The accompanying words trained from 
Chinese corpus may be translated into more than 
one English word. Here, the translation 
ambiguity may occur when translating the 
restrictions. Three alternatives are considered. 
In U1 (or A1) model, the terms without ambiguity, 
i.e., Chinese and English words are one-to-one 
correspondent in a Chinese-English bilingual 
dictionary, are added. In UT (or AT) model, th/~ 
terms with the same parts of speech (POSes) are 
added. That is, POS is used to select English 
word. In UTT (or ATT) model, we use mutual 
information to select op 10 accompanying terms 
of a Chinese query word, and POS is used to 
obtain the augmented translation restriction.

Figure 1. Models for Translation Ambiguity and Target Polysemy Resolution 
In the above treatment, a word C~ in a query Q 
is translated into (Ei, EWil, EWi2 . . . .  , EWimi). Ei 
is selected by Co-Model, and EWi~, EWi2 . . . .  , 
EWimi are augmented by different target polysemy 
resolution models. Intuitively, Ei, EWil, EWi2 .. . .  , 
EWim~ should have different weights. Ei is 
assigned a higher weight, and the words EWil, 
EWi2 ..... Eim~ in the restriction are assigned lower 
weights. They are determined by the following 
formula, where n is number of words in Q and mk 
is the number of words in a restriction for Ek. 
1 weight(Ei) - 
n+l  
1 
weight(EWij) = n 
(n + 1) * E mk 
k=l 
Thus six new models, i.e., A1W, ATW, ATTW, 
U1W, UTW and UTTW, are derived. Finally, 
we apply Co-model again to disambiguate the 
pseudo contexts and devise six new models 
(A1WCO, ATWCO, ATTWCO, U1WCO, 
UTWCO, and UTTWCO). In these six models, 
only one restriction word will be selected from the 
words  EWil, EWiz, ..., EWim i via disambiguation 
with other estrictions. 
4. Experimental Results 
To evaluate the above models, we employ 
TREC-6 text collection, TREC topics 301-350 
(Harman, 1997), and Smart information retrieval 
system (Salton and Buckley, 1988). The text 
collection contains 556,077 documents, and is 
about 2.2G bytes. Because the goal is to 
evaluate the performance of Chinese-English 
information retrieval on different models, we 
translate the 50 English queries into Chinese by 
human. The topic 332 is considered as an 
example in the following. The original English 
version and the human-translated Chinese version 
are shown. A TREC topic is composed of 
several fields. Tags <num>, <title>, <des>, and 
<narr> denote topic number, title, description, and 
narrative fields. Narrative provides a complete 
description of document relevance for the 
218 
assessors. In our experiments, only the fields of 
title and description are used to generate queries. 
<top> 
<num> Number: 332 
<title> Income Tax Evasion 
<desc> Description: 
This query is looking for investigations that have 
targeted evaders of U.S. income tax. 
<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document would mention investigations 
either in the U.S. or abroad of people suspected of evading 
U.S. income tax laws. Of particular interest are 
investigations involving revenue from illegal activities, as 
a strategy to bring known or suspected criminals to justice.

<C-desc> Description: 
<C-narr> Narrative:

</top> 
Totally, there are 1,017 words (557 distinct 
words) in the title and description fields of the 50 
translated TREC topics. Among these, 401 
words have unique translations and 616 words 
have multiple translation equivalents in our 
Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. Table 2 
shows the degree of word sense ambiguity in 
English and in Chinese, respectively. On the 
average, an English query term has 2.976 senses, 
and a Chinese query term has 1.828 senses only. 
In our experiments, LOB corpus is employed to 
train the co-occurrence statistics for translation 
ambiguity resolution, and ROCLING balanced 
corpus (Huang, et al, 1995) is employed to train 
the restrictions for target polysemy resolution. 
The mutual information tables are trained using a 
window size 3 for adjacent words. 
Table 3 shows the query translation of TREC 
topic 332. For the sake of space, only title field 
is shown. In Table 3(a), the first two rows list 
the original English query and the Chinese query. 
Rows 3 and 4 demonstrate the English translation 
by select-all model and co-occurrence model by 
resolving translation ambiguity only. Table 3(b) 
shows the augmented translation results using 
different models. Here, both translation 
ambiguity and target polysemy are resolved. 
The following lists the selected restrictions in A1 
model. 
i~_~(evasion): ~ .~_N (N: poundage), ~/t~_N (N: 
scot), ~ . tkV  (V: stay) 
?~-(income): I~g~_N (N: quota) 
~(tax): i /~_V (N: evasion), I~_N (N:surtax), ~t 
~,_N (N: surplus), ,g '~_N (N: sales tax) 
Augmented translation restrictions (poundage, 
scot, stay), (quota), and (evasion, surtax, surplus, 
sales tax) are added to "evasion", "income", and 
"tax", respectively. From Longman dictionary, 
we know there are 3 senses, 1 sense, and 2 senses 
for "evasion", "income", and "tax", respectively. 
Augmented restrictions are used to deal with 
target polysemy problem. Compared with A1 
model, only "evasion" is augmented with a 
translation restriction in U1 model. This is 
because " "~ ~ " (tao21uo4) has only one 
translation and "?~-"  (suo3de2) and "~"  (sui4) 
have more than one translation. Similarly, the 
augmented translation restrictions are omitted in 
the other U-models. Now we consider AT 
model. The Chinese restrictions, which have the 
matching POSes, are listed below: 
i~  (evasion): 
~_N (N: poundage), ~l~t~0~,_N (N: scot), L~_V (V: 
stay), ~N (N: droit, duty, geld, tax), li~l~f~ N (N: 
custom, douane, tariff), /~.~ V (V: avoid, elude, 
wangle, welch, welsh; N: avoidance, elusion, evasion, 
evasiveness, miss, runaround, shirk, skulk), i.~)~_V 
(V: contravene, infract, infringe; N: contravention, 
infraction, infringement, sin, violation) 
~" ~- (income): 
~_V (V: impose; N: division), ~.&~,_V (V: assess, put, 
tax; N: imposition, taxation), ~A~_N (N: Swiss, 
Switzer), i~_V  (V: minus, subtract), I~I\[$~_N (N: 
quota), I~l ~_N (N: commonwealth, folk, land, nation, 
nationality, son, subject) 
(tax): 
I~h~_N (N: surtax), .~t~g, N (N: surplus), ~ '~ 
_N (N: sales tax), g~V (V: abase, alight, debase, 
descend), r~_N (N: altitude, loftiness, tallness; ADJ: 
high; ADV: loftily), ~V (V: comprise, comprize, 
embrace, ncompass), -~V (V: compete, mulate, vie; 
N: conflict, contention, duel, strife)

Those English words whose POSes are the 
same as the corresponding Chinese restrictions are 
selected as augmented translation restriction. 
For example, the translation o f "~"_V  (tao2bi4) 
has two possible POSes, i.e., V and N, so only 
"avoid", "elude", "wangle", "welch", and "welsh" 
are chosen. The other terms are added in the 
similar way. Recall that we use mutual 
information to select the top 10 accompanying 
terms of a Chinese query term in ATT model. 
The 5 ~ row shows that the augmented translation 
restrictions for "?)i"~-" (suo3de2) and "~," (sui4) 
are removed because their top 10 Chinese 
accompanying terms do not have English 
translations of the same POSes. Finally, we 
consider ATWCO model. The words "tax", 
"land", and "surtax" are selected from the three 
lists in 3 rd row of Table 3(b) respectively, by using 
word co-occurrences. 
Figure 2 shows the number of relevant 
documents on the top 1000 retrieved documents 
for Topics 332 and 337. The performances are 
stable in all of the +weight (W) models and the 
enhanced CO restriction (WCO) models, even 
there are different number of words in translation 
restrictions. Especially, the enhanced CO 
restriction models add at most one translated 
restriction word for each query tenn. They can 
achieve the similar performance to those models 
that add more translated restriction words. 
Surprisingly, the augmented translation results 
may perform better than the monolingual retrieval. 
Topic 337 in Figure 2 is an example. 
Table 4 shows the overall performance of 18 
different models for 50 topics. Eleven-point 
average precision on the top 1000 retrieved 
documents i adopted to measure the performance 
of all the experiments. The monolingual 
information retrieval, i.e., the original English 
queries to English text collection, is regarded as a 
baseline model. The performance is 0.1459 
under the specified environment. The select-all 
model, i.e., all the translation equivalents are 
passed without disambiguation, has 0.0652 
average precision. About 44.69% of the 
performance of the monolingual information 
retrieval is achieved. When co-occurrence 
model is employed to resolve translation 
ambiguity, 0.0831 average precision (56.96% of 
monolingual information retrieval) is reported. 
Compared to do-nothing model, the performance 
is 27.45% increase. 
Now we consider the treatment of translation 
ambiguity and target polysemy together. 
Augmented restrictions are formed in A1, AT, 
ATT, U1, UT and UTT models, however, their 
performances are worse than Co-model 
(translation disambiguation only). The major

reason is the restrictions may introduce errors. 
That can be found from the fact that models U 1, 
UT, and UTT are better than A1, AT, and ATT. 
Because the translation of restriction from source 
language (Chinese) to target language (English) 
has the translation ambiguity problem, the models 
(U1 and A1) introduce the unambiguous 
restriction terms and perform better than other 
models. Controlled augmentation shows higher 
performance than uncontrolled augmentation. 
When different weights are assigned to the 
original English translation and the augmented 
restrictions, all the models are improved 
significantly. The performances of A1W, ATW, 
ATTW, U1W, UTW, and UTTW are about 
10.11% addition to the model for translation 
disambiguation only. Of these models, the 
performance change from model AT to model 
ATW is drastic, i.e., from 0.0419 (28.72%) to 
0.0913 (62.58%). It tells us the original English 
translation plays a major role, but the augmented 
restriction still has a significant effect on the 
performance. 
We know that restriction for each English 
translation presents a pseudo English context. 
Thus we apply the co-occurrence model again on 
the pseudo English contexts. The performances 
are increased a little. These models add at most 
one translated restriction word for each query 
term, but their performances are better than those 
models that adding more translated restriction 
words. It tells us that a good translated 
restriction word for each query term is enough for 
resolving target polysemy problem. U1WCO, 
which is the best in these experiments, gains 
62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and 
40.80% increase to the do-nothing model (select- 
all).

5. Concluding Remarks 
This paper deals with translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy at the same time. We utilize 
two monolingual balanced corpora to learn useful 
statistical data, i.e., word co-occurrence for 
translation ambiguity resolution, and translation 
restrictions for target polysemy resolution. 
Aligned bilingual corpus or special domain corpus 
is not required in this design. Experiments how 
that resolving both translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy gains about 10.11% performance 
addition to the method for translation 
disambiguation in cross-language information 
retrieval. We also analyze the two factors: word 
sense ambiguity in source language (translation 
ambiguity), and word sense ambiguity in target 
language (target polysemy). The statistics of 
word sense ambiguities have shown that target 
polysemy resolution is critical in Chinese-English 
information retrieval. 
This treatment is very suitable to translate very 
short query on Web, The queries on Web are 
1.5-2 words on the average (Pinkerton, 1994; 
Fitzpatrick and Dent, 1997). Because the major 
components of queries are nouns, at least one 
word of a short query of length 1.5-2 words is 
noun. Besides, most of the Chinese nouns are 
unambiguous, so that translation ambiguity is not 
serious comparatively, but target polysemy is 
critical in Chinese-English Web retrieval. The 
translation restrictions, which introduce pseudo 
contexts, are helpful for target polysemy 
resolution. The applications of this method to 
cross-language Internet searching, the 
applicability of this method to other language 
pairs, and the effects of human-computer 
interaction on resolving translation ambiguity and 
target polysemy will be studied in the future.
