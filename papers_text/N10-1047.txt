Abstract
This paper presents an empirical comparison
of similarity measures for pairs of concepts
based on Information Content. It shows that
using modest amounts of untagged text to de-
rive Information Content results in higher cor-
relation with human similarity judgments than
using the largest available corpus of manually
annotated sense?tagged text.
1 Introduction
Measures of semantic similarity based on WordNet
have been widely used in Natural Language Pro-
cessing. These measures rely on the structure of
WordNet to produce a numeric score that quantifies
the degree to which two concepts (represented by
a sense or synset) are similar (or not). In their sim-
plest form these measures use path length to identify
concepts that are physically close to each other and
therefore considered to be more similar than con-
cepts that are further apart.
While this is a reasonable first approximation to
semantic similarity, there are some well known limi-
tations. Most significant is that path lengths between
very specific concepts imply much smaller distinc-
tions in semantic similarity than do comparable path
lengths between very general concepts. One pro-
posed improvement is to augment concepts in Word-
Net with Information Content values derived from
sense?tagged corpora or from raw unannotated cor-
pora (Resnik, 1995).
This paper shows that Information Content mea-
sures based on modest amounts of unannotated cor-
pora have greater correlation with human similarity
judgements than do those based on the largest corpus
of sense-tagged text currently available.1 The key
to this success is not in the specific type of corpora
used, but rather in increasing the number of con-
cepts in WordNet that have counts associated with
them. These results show that Information Content
measures of semantic similarity can be significantly
improved without requiring the creation of sense?
tagged corpora (which is very expensive).
1.1 Information Content
Information Content (IC) is a measure of specificity
for a concept. Higher values are associated with
more specific concepts (e.g., pitch fork), while those
with lower values are more general (e.g., idea). In-
formation Content is computed based on frequency
counts of concepts as found in a corpus of text. The
frequency associated with a concept is incremented
in WordNet each time that concept is observed, as
are the counts of the ancestor concepts in the Word-
Net hierarchy (for nouns and verbs). This is neces-
sary because each occurrence of a more specific con-
cept also implies the occurrence of the more general
ancestor concepts.
When a corpus is sense?tagged, mapping occur-
rences of a word to a concept is straightforward
(since each sense of a word corresponds with a con-
cept or synset in WordNet). However, if the text has
not been sense?tagged then all of the possible senses
of a given word are incremented (as are their ances-
tors). For example, if tree (as a plant) occurs in a
sense?tagged text, then only the concept associated

Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al, 2004).

with tree as a kind of plant would be incremented. If
the text is untagged, then all of the possible senses
of tree would be incremented (such as the mathe-
matical sense of tree, a shoe tree, a plant, etc.) In
this case the frequency of all the occurrences of a
word are divided equally among the different pos-
sible senses. Thus, if a word occurs 42 times in a
corpus and there are six possible senses (concepts),
each sense and all of their ancestors would have their
frequency incremented by seven.2
For each concept (synset) c in WordNet, Informa-
tion Content is defined as the negative log of the
probability of that concept (based on the observed
frequency counts):
IC(c) = ?logP (c)
Information Content can only be computed for
nouns and verbs in WordNet, since these are the only
parts of speech where concepts are organized in hi-
erarchies. Since these hierarchies are separate, In-
formation Content measures of similarity can only
be applied to pairs of nouns or pairs of verbs.
2 Semantic Similarity Measures
There are three Information Content measures im-
plemented in WordNet::Similarity: (res) (Resnik,
1995), (jcn) (Jiang and Conrath, 1997), and (lin)
(Lin, 1998).
These measures take as input two concepts c1 and
c2 (i.e., senses or synsets in WordNet) and output a
numeric measure of similarity. These measures all
rely to varying degrees on the idea of a least com-
mon subsumer (LCS); this is the most specific con-
cept that is a shared ancestor of the two concepts.
For example, the LCS of automobile and scooter is
vehicle.
The Resnik (res) measure simply uses the Infor-
mation Content of the LCS as the similarity value:
res(c1, c2) = IC(LCS(c1, c2))
The Resnik measure is considered somewhat
coarse, since many different pairs of concepts may
share the same LCS. However, it is less likely to
suffer from zero counts (and resulting undefined val-
ues) since in general the LCS of two concepts will
not be a very specific concept (i.e., a leaf node in
2This is the ?resnik counting option in WordNet::Similarity.
WordNet), but will instead be a somewhat more gen-
eral concept that is more likely to have observed
counts associated with it.
Both the Lin and Jiang & Conrath measures at-
tempt to refine the Resnik measure by augmenting it
with the Information Content of the individual con-
cepts being measured in two different ways:
lin(c1, c2) =
2?res(c1,c2)
IC(c1)+IC(c2)
jcn(c1, c2) = 1IC(c1)+IC(c2)?2?res(c1,c2)
All three of these measures have been widely
used in the NLP literature, and have tended to per-
form well in a wide range of applications such as
word sense disambiguation, paraphrase detection,
and Question Answering (c.f., (Resnik, 1999)).
3 Experimental Data
Information Content in WordNet::Similarity is (by
default) derived from SemCor (Miller et al, 1993), a
manually sense?tagged subset of the Brown Corpus.
It is made up of approximately 676,000 words, of
which 226,000 are sense?tagged. SemCor was orig-
inally created using sense?tags from version 1.6 of
WordNet, and has been mapped to subsequent ver-
sions to stay current.3 This paper uses version 3.0 of
WordNet and SemCor.
WordNet::Similarity also includes a utility (raw-
textFreq.pl) that allows a user to derive Information
Content values from any corpus of plain text. This
utility is used with the untagged version of SemCor
and with various portions of the English GigaWord
corpus (1st edition) to derive alternative Information
Content values.
English GigaWord contains more than 1.7 billion
words of newspaper text from the 1990?s and early
21st century, divided among four different sources:
Agence France Press English Service (afe), Associ-
ated Press Worldstream English Service (apw), The
New York Times Newswire Service (nyt), and The
Xinhua News Agency English Service (xie).
This paper compares the ranking of pairs of con-
cepts according to Information Content measures in
WordNet::Similarity with a number of manually cre-
ated gold standards. These include the (RG) (Ruben-
stein and Goodenough, 1965) collection of 65 noun

pairs, the (MC) (Miller and Charles, 1991) collec-
tion of 30 noun pairs (a subset of RG), and the (WS)
WordSimilarity-353 collection of 353 pairs (Finkel-
stein et al, 2002). RG and MC have been scored for
similarity, while WS is scored for relatedness, which
is a more general and less well?defined notion than
similarity. For example aspirin and headache are
clearly related, but they aren?t really similar.
4 Experimental Results
Table 1 shows the Spearman?s rank correlation of
several other measures of similarity and relatedness
in WordNet::Similarity with the gold standards dis-
cussed above. The WordNet::Similarity vector relat-
edness measure achieves the highest correlation, fol-
lowed closely by the adapted lesk measure. These
results are consistent with previous findings (Pat-
wardhan and Pedersen, 2006). This table also shows
results for several path?based measures.4
Table 2 shows the correlation of jcn, res, and lin
when Information Content is derived from 1) the
sense-tagged version of SemCor (semcor), 2) Sem-
Cor without sense tags (semcor-raw), and 3) steadily
increasing subsets of the 133 million word xie por-
tion of the English GigaWord corpus. These sub-
sets start with the entire first month of xie (199501,
from January 1995) and then two months (199501-
02), three months (199501-03), up through all of
1995 (199501-12). Thereafter the increments are an-
nual, with two years of data (1995-1996), then three
(1995-1997), and so on until the entire xie corpus is
used (1995-2001). The afe, apw, and nyt portions of
GigaWord are also used individually and then com-
bined all together along with xie (all).
4wup is the Wu & Palmer measure, lch is the Leacock &
Chodorow measure, path relies on edge counting, and random
provides a simple sanity check.
The size (in tokens) of each corpus is shown in the
second column of Table 2 (size), which is expressed
in thousands (k), millions (m), and billions (b).
The third column (cover) shows what percentage
of the 96,000 noun and verb synsets in WordNet re-
ceive a non-zero frequency count when Information
Content is derived from the specified corpus. These
values show that the 226,000 sense?tagged instances
in SemCor cover about 24%, and the untagged ver-
sion of SemCor covers 37%. As it happens the cor-
relation results for semcor-raw are somewhat better
than semcor, suggesting that coverage is at least as
important (if not more so) to the performance of In-
formation Content measures than accurate mapping
of words to concepts.
A similar pattern can be seen with the xie results
in Table 2. This again shows that an increase in
WordNet coverage is associated with increased per-
formance of the Information Content measures. As
coverage increases the correlation improves, and in
fact the results are better than the path?based mea-
sures and approach those of lesk and vector (see Ta-
ble 1). The one exception is with respect to the WS
gold standard, where vector and lesk perform much
better than the Information Content measures. How-
ever, this seems reasonable since they are related-
ness measures, and the WS corpus is annotated for
relatedness rather than similarity.
As a final test of the hypothesis that coverage
matters as much or more than accurate mapping of
words to concepts, a simple baseline method was
created that assigns each synset a count of 1, and
then propagates that count up to the ancestor con-
cepts. This is equivalent to doing add-1 smoothing
without any text (add1only). This results in corre-
lation nearly as high as the best results with xie and
semcor-raw, and is significantly better than semcor.
5 Conclusions
This paper shows that semantic similarity mea-
sures based on Information Content can be signif-
icantly improved by increasing the coverage of the
frequency counts used to derive Information Con-
tent. Increased coverage can come from unannotated
text or simply assigning counts to every concept in
WordNet and does not require sense?tagged text.
