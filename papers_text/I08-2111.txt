Abstract
In this article we want to demonstrate that
annotation of multiword expressions in the
Prague Dependency Treebank is a well de-
fined task, that it is useful as well as feasible,
and that we can achieve good consistency of
such annotations in terms of inter-annotator
agreement. We show a way to measure agree-
ment for this type of annotation. We also ar-
gue that some automatic pre-annotation is
possible and it does not damage the results.
1 Motivation
Various projects involving lexico-semantic annota-
tion have been ongoing for many years. Among those
there are the projects of word sense annotation, usu-
ally for creating training data for word sense disam-
biguation. However majority of these projects have
only annotated very limited number of word senses
(cf. Kilgarriff (1998)). Even among those that aim
towards ?all words? word-sense annotation, multi-
word expressions (MWE) are not annotated adequa-
tely (see (Mihalcea, 1998) or (Hajic? et al, 2004)),
because for their successful annotation a method-
ology allowing identification of new MWEs during
annotation is required. Existing dictionaries that in-
clude MWEs concentrate only on the most frequent
ones, but we argue that there are many more MWEs
that can only be identified (and added to the dictio-
nary) by annotation.
There are various projects for identification of na-
med entities (for an overview see (?evc??kov? et al,
2007)). We explain below (mainly in Section 2) why
we consider named entities to be concerned with lex-
ical meaning. At this place we just wish to recall that
these projects only select some specific parts of text
and provide information only for these. They do not
aim for full lexico-semantic annotation of texts.
There is also another group of projects that have to
tackle the problem of lexical meaning, namely tree-
banking projects that aim to develop a deeper layer
of annotation in adition to a surface syntactic layer.
This deeper layer is generally agreed to concern lex-
ical meaning. Therefore the units of this layer cannot
be words anymore, they should be lexias.
Lexia is defined by Filipec and C?erm?k (1986)
as equivalent to a ?monosemic lexeme? of (Filipec,
1994) or a ?lexical unit? of (Cruse, 1986): ?a pair
of a single sense and a basic form (plus its derived
forms) with relatively stable semantic properties?.
We work with the Prague Dependency Treebank
(PDT, see Hajic? (2005)), which has in addition to
the morphemic and the surface syntactic layers also
the tectogrammatical layer. The latter has been con-
strued as the layer of the (literal) meaning of the sen-
tence and thus should be composed of lexias (lexical
units) and the relations between their occurrences.1
On the tectogrammatical layer only the autose-
mantic words form nodes in a tree (t-nodes). Synse-
mantic (function) words are represented by various
attributes of t-nodes. Each t-node has a lemma: an at-
tribute whose value is the node?s basic lexical form.
Currently t-nodes, and consequently their t-lemmas,
are still visibly derived from the morphological di-
vision of text into tokens. This preliminary handling

refer to other lexias) or coordination heads.

has always been considered unsatisfactory in FGD.2
There is a clear goal to distinguish t-lemmas through
their senses, but this process has not been completed
so far.
Our project aims at improving the current state
of t-lemmas. Our goal is to assign each t-node a
t-lemma that would correspond to a lexia, i.e. that
would really distinguish the t-node?s lexical mean-
ings. To achieve this goal, in the first phase of the
project, which we report on in this paper, we iden-
tify multiword expressions and create a lexicon of
the corresponding lexias.
2 Introduction
We annotate all occurrences of MWEs (including
named entities, see below) in PDT 2.0. When we
speak of multiword expressions we mean ?idiosyn-
cratic interpretations that cross word boundaries?
(Sag et al, 2002). We understand multiword expres-
sions as a type of lexias. We distinguish also a spe-
cial type of MWEs, for which we are mainly inter-
ested in its type, rather than individual lexias, during
the annotation: named entities (NE).3 Treatment of
NEs together with other MWEs is important, be-
cause syntactic functions are more or less arbitrary
inside a NE (consider an address with phone num-
bers, etc.) and so is the assignment of semantic roles.
That is why we need each NE to be combined into a
single node, just like we do it with MWEs in general.
For the purpose of annotation we have built a repos-
itory of lexias corresponding to MWEs, which we
call SemLex. We have built it using entries from
some existing dictionaries and it is being enriched
during the annotation in order to contain every lexia
that was annotated. We explain this in detail in Sec-
tion 4.1.
3 Current state of MWEs in PDT 2.0
During the annotation of valency that is a part of
the tectogrammatical layer of PDT 2.0 the t-lemmas
2Functional Generative Description (FGD, (Sgall et al,
1986; Hajic?ov? et al, 1998)) is a framework for system-
atic description of a language, that the PDT project is based
upon. In FGD units of the t-layer are construed equivalently to
monosemic lexemes (lexias) and are combined into dependency
trees, based on syntactic valency of the lexias.
3NEs can in general be also single-word, but in this phase of
our project we are only interested in multiword expressions, so
when we say NE in this paper, we always mean multiword.
that correspond to lexias have been basically iden-
tified for all the verbs and some nouns and adjec-
tives. The resulting valency lexicon is called PDT-
VALLEX (Hajic? et al, 2003) and we can see it as
a repository of lexias based on verbs, adjectives and
nouns in PDT that have valency. 4
This is a starting point for having t-nodes corre-
sponding to lexias. However in the current state it is
not fully sufficient even for verbs, mainly because
parts of MWEs are not joined into one node. Parts
of frames marked as idiomatic are still represented
by separate t-nodes in a tectogrammatical tree. Ver-
bal phrasemes are also split into 2 nodes, where the
nominal part is governed by the verb. Non-verbal id-
ioms have not been annotated at all.
Below we give an example of the current state:
an idiom meaning ?in a blink (of an eye)? ? literally
?*what not-see? (Figure 1).
Figure 1: ?Co nevide?t? (in a blink)
4 Methodology
4.1 Building SemLex
Each entry we add into SemLex is considered to be
a lexia. We have also added 9 special entries to iden-
tify NE types, so we do not need to add the expres-
sions themselves. These types are derived from NE
classification by (?evc??kov? et al, 2007). Some fre-
quent names of persons, institutions or other objects
(e.g. film titles) are being added into SemLex dur-
ing annotation (while keeping the information about
a NE type), because this allows for their following
occurrences to be pre-annotated automatically (see
Section 5). For others, like addresses or bibliographic
4It is so because in PDT-VALLEX valency is not the only
criterion for distinguishing frames (=meanings). Two words
with the same morphological lemma and valency frame are as-
signed two different frames if their meaning differs. Thus the
PDT-VALLEX frames correspond to lexias.
794
entries, it makes but little sense, because they most
probably will not reappear during the annotation.
Currently (for the first stage of lexico-semantic
annotation of PDT) SemLex contains only lexias cor-
responding to MWEs. Its base has been composed of
MWEs extracted from Czech WordNet (Smr?, 2003),
Eurovoc (Eurovoc, 2007) and SC?FI (C?erm?k et al,
1994).5 Currently there are over 30,000 multi-word
lexias in SemLex and more are being added during
annotations.
The entries added by annotators must be lexias as
defined above. Annotators define their ?sense? infor-
mally (as much as possible) and we extract an exam-
ple of usage and the basic form from the annotation
automatically. The ?sense? information shall be re-
vised by a lexicographer, based on annotated occur-
rences.
4.2 Annotation
PDT 2.0 uses PML (Pajas and ?te?p?nek, 2005),
which is an application of XML that utilises a stand-
off annotation scheme. We have extended the PDT-
PML with a new schema for so-called s-files. We
use these files to store all of our annotation without
altering the PDT itself. These s-files are very sim-
ple: basically each of them consists of a list of s-
nodes. Each s-node corresponds to an occurrence of
a MWE and it is composed of a link to the entry in
SemLex and a list of identifiers of t-nodes that cor-
respond to this s-node.
Our annotation program reads in a tectogrammati-
cal representation (t-file) and calls TrEd (Pajas, 2007)
to generate plain text. This plain text (still linked to
the tectogrammatical representation) is presented to
the annotator. While the annotator marks MWEs al-
ready present in SemLex or adds new MWEs into
SemLex, tree representations of these MWEs extrac-
ted from underlying t-trees are added into their Sem-
Lex entries via TrEd scripts.
5 Pre-annotation
Because MWEs tend to occur repeatedly in a text,
we have decided to test pre-annotation both for the
speed improvement and for improving the consis-
tency of annotations. On the assumption that all oc-
5Slovn?k c?esk? frazeologie a idiomatiky (Dictionary of
Czech Phraseology and Idiomatics)
currences of a MWE share the same tree structure,
while there are no restrictions on the surface word
order other than those imposed by the tree structure
itself we have decided to employ four types of pre-
annotation:
A) External pre-annotation provided by our col-
league (see Hn?tkov? (2002)). With each MWE a
set of rules is associated that limits possible forms
and surface word order of parts of a MWE. This ap-
proach was devised for corpora that are not syntac-
tically annotated.
B) Our one-time pre-annotation with those lexias
from SemLex that were already used in annotation,
and thus have a tree structure as a part of their entry.
C) Dynamic pre-annotation as in B, only with the
SemLex entries that have been recently added by the
annotator.
D) When an annotator tags an occurrence of a
MWE in the text, other occurrences of this MWE
in the article are identified automatically.6
(A) was executed once for all of the PDT. (B) is
performed each time we merge lexias added by an-
notators into the main SemLex. We carry out this
annotation in one batch for all PDT files remaining
to annotate. (C) should be done for each file while
it is being opened in LexemAnn GUI. (D) happens
each time the annotator adds a new lexia into Sem-
Lex and uses it to annotate an occurrence in the text.
In subsequent files instances of this lexia are already
annotated in step (C), and later even in (B).
After the pilot annotation without pre-annotation
(D) we have compared instances of the same tags
and found that 10.5% of repeated lexias happened
to have two different trees. After closer examination
this 10.5% group is negligible because these cases
are caused by ellipses, variations in lexical form such
as diminutives etc., or wrong lemmatisation, rather
than inconsistencies in the tree structure. These cases
show us some issues of PDT 2.0, for instance:
? ji?n? ? Ji?n? Korea [southern ? South Korea] ?
wrong lemmatisation
6This is exactly what happens: 1) Tree structure of the se-
lected MWE is identified via TrEd 2) The tree structure is added
to the lexeme?s entry in SemLex 3) All the sentences in the
given file are searched for the same MWE using its tree structure
(via TrEd) 4) Other occurrences returned by TrEd are tagged
with this MWE?s ID, but these occurrences receive an attribute
?auto?, which identifies them (both in the s-files and visually in
the annotation tool) as annotated automatically.

? obchodn? r?editel ? r?editelka [managing direc-
tor ? man ? woman] ? in future these should
have one t-lemma and gender should be speci-
fied by an attribute of a t-node.
We have not found any case that would show that
there is such a MWE that its structure cannot be rep-
resented by a single tectogrammatical tree. 1.1% of
all occurences were not connected graphs, but this
happened due to errors in data and to coordination.
This corroborates our assumption that (disregarding
errors) all occurrences of a MWE share the same
tree structure. As a result, we started storing the tree
structures in the SemLex entries and employ them in
pre-annotation (D). This also allows us to use pre-
annotations (B) and (C), but we have decided not
to use them at the moment, in order to be able to
evaluate each pre-annotation step separately. Thus
the following section reports on the experiments that
employ pre-annotation (A) and (D).
6 Analysis of Annotations
Two annotators already started to use (and test) the
tool we have developed. They both have got the same
texts. The text is generated from the t-trees and pre-
sented as a plain text with pre-annotated words mark-
ed by colour labels. Annotators add their tags in the
form of different colour labels and they can delete
the pre-annotated tags. In this experiment data con-
sists of approx. 120,000 tokens that correspond to
100,000 t-nodes. Both annotators have marked about
15,200 t-nodes (~15%) as parts of MWEs. annotator
A has grouped them into 7,263 MWEs and annota-
tor B into 6,888. So the average length of a MWE is
2.2 t-nodes.
The ratio of general named entities versus Sem-
Lex lexias was 52:48 for annotator A and 49:51 in
case of annotator B. Annotator B used 10% more
lexias than annotatorA (3,279 and 3,677), while they
both used almost the same number of NEs. Some
comparison is in the Table 1.

Named Entities 3,553 3,587

- institution 842 772
Table 1: Annotated instances of significant types of
MWEs
Both annotators also needed to add missing en-
tries to the originally compiled SemLex or to edit
existing entries. annotatorA added 722 entries while
the annotator B added 861. They modified 796 and
809 existing entries, respectively.
6.1 Inter-anntator Agreement
In this section our primary goal is to assess whether
with our current methodology we produce reliable
annotation of MWEs. To that end we measure the
amount of inter-annotator agreement that is above
chance. There are, however, a few sources of com-
plications in measuring this agreement:
? Each tag of a MWE identifies a subtree of a tec-
togrammatical tree (represented on the surface by a
set of marked words). This allows for partial agree-
ment of tags at the beginning, at the end, but also in
the middle of a surface interval (in a sentence).
? A disagreement of the annotators on the tag is
still an agreement on the fact that this t-node is a part
of a MWE and thus should be tagged. This means we
have to allow for partial agreement on a tag.
? There is not any clear upper bound as to how
many (and how long) MWEs are there in texts.
? There is not a clear and simple way to esti-
mate the amount of the agreement by chance, be-
cause it must include the partial agreements men-
tioned above.
Since we want to keep our agreement calculation
as simple as possible but we also need to take into
account the problems above, we have decided to start
from pi as defined in (Artstein and Poesio, 2007) and
to make a few adjustments to allow for types of par-
tial agreement and estimated maximal agreement.
Because we do not know how many MWEs there
are in our texts, we need to calculate the agreement
over all t-nodes, rather than the t-nodes that ?should
be annotated?. This also means, that the theoretical
maximal agreement (upper bound) U , cannot be 1.
If it was 1, it would be saying that all nodes are part
of a MWE.
Since we know that U < 1 but we do not know
it?s exact value, we use the estimated upper bound
U? (see Equation 1). Because we calculate U? over all
t-nodes, we need to account not only for agreement
on tagging a t-node, but also for agreement, that the
t-node is not a part of a MWE, therefore it is not
796
tagged.7
If N is the number of all t-nodes in our data and
nA?B is the number of t-nodes annotated by at least
one annotator, then we estimate U? as follows:
U? =
nA?B
N
+ 0.052 ?
N ? nA?B
N
= 0.215 (1)
The weight 0.052 used for scoring the t-nodes that
were not annotated is explained below. Because U?
includes all the disagreements of the annotators, we
believe that the real upper bound U lies somewhat
below it and the agreement value 0.215 is not some-
thing that should (or could) be achieved. This is how-
ever based on the assumption that the data we have
not yet seen have similar ratio of MWEs as the data
we have used.
To account for partial agreement we divide the t-
nodes into 5 classes c and assign each class a weight
w as follows:
c1 If the annotators agree on the exact tag from Sem-
Lex, we get maximum information: w = 1
c2 If they agree, that the t-node is a part of a NE or
they agree it is a part of some lexia from Sem-
Lex, but they do not agree which NE or which
lexia, we estimate we get about a half of the in-
formation compared to c1: w = 0.5
c3 If they agree that the t-node is a part of a MWE,
but disagree whether a NE or a lexia from Sem-
Lex, it is again half the information compared to
c2, so w = 0.25
c4 If they agree that the t-node is not a part of a
MWE, w = 0.052. This low value of w accounts
for frequency of t-nodes that are not a part of a
MWE, as estimated from data: Agreement on not
annotating provides the same amount of infor-
mation as agreement on annotating, but we have
to take into account higher frequency of t-nodes
that are not annotated:
c4 = c3 ?
P
annotated
P
not annotated
= 0.25 ?
12797
61433
? 0.052
c5 If the annotators do not agree whether to anno-
tate a t-node or not, w = 0.
The number of t-nodes (n) and weights w per class
c are given in Table 2.
7If we did not do this, there would be no difference between
t-nodes, that were not tagged (annotators agreed they are not a
part of a MWE) and the t-nodes that one annotator tagged and
the other did not (i.e. they disagreed).

weight w 1 0.5 0.25 0.052 0
Table 2: The agreement per class and the associated
weights
Now that we have estimated the upper bound of
agreement U? and the weights w for all t-nodes we
can calculate our weighted version of pi:
piw =
Ao ?Ae
U? ?Ae
Ao is the observed agreement of annotators and
Ae is the agreement expected by chance (which is
similar to a baseline). piw is thus a simple ratio of our
observed agreement above chance and maximum a-
greement above chance.
Weights w come into account in calculation ofAo
and Ae.
We calculate Ao by multiplying the number of t-
nodes in each category c by that category?s weight
w, summing these 5 weighted sums and dividing this
sum of all the observed agreement in the data by
the total number of t-nodes: Ao = 1N
?5
c=1 ncwc =
0.160.
Ae is the probability of agreement expected by
chance over all t-nodes. This means it is the sum of
the weighted probabilities of all the combinations of
all the tags that can be obtained by a pair of annota-
tors. Every possible combination of tags (including
not tagging a t-node) falls into one of the categories
c and thus gets the appropriate weight w. Calculat-
ing the value of Ae depends not only on values of
w (see Table 2), but also on the fact that SemLex is
composed of 9 entries for NE types and over 30,000
entries for individual lexias. Based on this we have
obtained Ae = 0.047.
The resulting piw is then
piw =
Ao ?Ae
U? ?Ae
=
0.160? 0.047
0.215? 0.047
= 0.6760
When we analyse the cases of disagreement and
partial agreement we find that most of it has to do
with SemLex lexias rather than NEs. This is mostly
due to imperfectness of the dictionary and its size
(annotators could not explore each of almost 30,000
797
of SemLex entries). Our current methodology, which
relies too much on searching the SemLex, is also to
blame. This should, however, improve by employing
pre-annotation (B) and (C).
One more reason for disagreement consists in the
fact that there are cases, for which non-trivial knowl-
edge of the world is needed: ?Jang Di Pertuan Agong
Sultan Azlan ??h, the sultan of the state of Perak,
[ . . . ] flew back to Perak.? Is ?Sultan Azlan ??h? still
a part of the name or is it (or a part of it) a title?
The last important reason of disagreement is sim-
ple: both annotators identify the same part of text
as MWE instances, but while searching the SemLex
they choose different lexias as the tags. This can be
rectified by:
? Removing duplicate entries from SemLex (cur-
rently there are many close identical entries orig-
inating from Eurovoc and Czech WordNet).
? Imploring improved pre-annotation B and C, as
mentioned above.
7 Conclusion
We have annotated multi-word lexias and named en-
tities in a part of PDT 2.0. We use tectogrammati-
cal tree structures of MWEs for the automatic pre-
annotation. In the analysis of inter-annotator agree-
ment we show that a weighted measure that accounts
for partial agreement as well as the estimation of
maximal agreement is needed.
The resulting piw = 0.6760 is statistically sig-
nificant and should gradually improve as we clean
up the annotation lexicon, more entries can be pre-
annotated automatically, and further types of pre-
annotation are employed.
