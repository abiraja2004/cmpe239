Abstract 
In this paper, we present a user study where a 
robot instructs a human on how to draw a 
route on a map, similar to a Map Task. This 
setup has allowed us to study user reactions to 
the robot?s conversational behaviour in order 
to get a better understanding of how to gener-
ate utterances in incremental dialogue systems. 
We have analysed the participants' subjective 
rating, task completion, verbal responses, gaze 
behaviour, drawing activity, and cognitive 
load. The results show that users utilise the ro-
bot?s gaze in order to disambiguate referring 
expressions and manage the flow of the inter-
action. Furthermore, we show that the user?s 
behaviour is affected by how pauses are real-
ised in the robot?s speech.  
1 Introduction 
Dialogue systems have traditionally relied on 
several simplifying assumptions. When it comes 
to temporal resolution, the interaction has been 
assumed to take place with a strict turn-taking 
protocol, where each speaker takes discrete turns 
with noticeable gaps in between. While this as-
sumption simplifies processing, it fails to model 
many aspects of human-human interaction such 
as turn-taking with very short gaps or brief over-
laps and backchannels in the middle of utteranc-
es (Heldner & Edlund, 2010). Recently, re-
searchers have turned to more incremental mod-
els, where the dialogue is processed in smaller 
units (Schlangen & Skantze, 2011). On the out-
put side, this allows dialogue systems to start 
speaking before processing is complete, generat-
ing and synthesizing the response segment by 
segment, until the complete response is realised. 
If a segment is delayed, there will be a pause in 
the middle of the system?s speech. While previ-
ous studies have clearly shown the potential ben-
efits of incremental speech generation (Skantze 
& Hjalmarsson, 2012; Dethlefs et al, 2012; 
Buschmeier et al, 2012), there are few studies on 
how users react to pauses in the middle of the 
system?s speech.  
Apart from the real-time nature of spoken in-
teraction, spoken dialog technology has for a 
long time also neglected the physical space in 
which the interaction takes place. In application 
scenarios which involve situated interaction, 
such as human-robot interaction, there might be 
several users talking to the system at the same 
time (Bohus & Horvitz, 2010), and there might 
be physical objects in the surroundings that the 
user and the system refer to during the interac-
tion (Boucher et al, 2012). In such settings, gaze 
plays a very important role in the coordination of 
joint attention and turn-taking. However, it is not 
clear to what extent humans are able to utilize 
the gaze of a robot and respond to these cues.  
Here, we present a user study where a robot 
instructs a human on how to draw a route on a 
map, similar to a Map Task. The nature of this 
setting allows us to study the two phenomena 
outlined above. First, we want to understand how 
a face-to-face setting facilitates coordination of 
actions between a robot and a user, and how well 
humans can utilize the robot's gaze to disambig-
uate referring expressions in situated interaction. 
The second purpose of this study is to investigate 
how the system can either inhibit or encourage 
different types of user reactions while pausing by 
using filled pauses, gaze and syntactic complete-
ness.   
2 Background 
2.1 Gaze in situated interaction 
Gaze is one of the most studied visual cues in 
face-to-face interaction, and it has been associat-
ed with a variety of functions, such as managing 
attention (Vertegaal et al, 2001), expressing in-
timacy and exercising social control (Kleinke, 
163
1986), highlighting the information structure of 
the propositional content of speech (Cassell, 
1999) as well as coordinating turn-taking 
(Duncan, 1972). One of the most influential pub-
lications on this subject (Kendon, 1967) shows 
that speakers gaze away when initiating a new 
turn. At the end of a turn, in contrast, speakers 
shift their gaze towards their interlocutors as to 
indicate that the conversational floor is about to 
become available. Furthermore, it has been 
shown that gaze plays an important role in col-
laborative tasks. In a map task study by Boyle et 
al. (1994), it was shown that speakers in a face-
to-face setting interrupt each other less and use 
fewer turns, words, and backchannels per dia-
logue than speakers who can not see each other. 
A lot of research has also been done on how 
gaze can be used to facilitate turn-taking with 
robots (Mutlu et al, 2006; Al Moubayed et al, 
2013) and embodied conversational agents 
(Torres et al, 1997). Several studies have also 
explored situated human-robot interaction, where 
the interlocutors sit around a table with objects 
that can be referred to, thus constituting a shared 
space of attention (Yoshikawa et al, 2006; John-
son-Roberson et al, 2011). However, there are 
very few studies on how the robot?s gaze at ob-
jects in the shared visual scene may improve task 
completion in an interactive setting. One excep-
tion is a controlled experiment presented by 
Boucher et al (2012), where the iCub robot in-
teracted with human subjects. While the study 
showed that humans could utilize the robot?s 
gaze, the interaction was not that of a free con-
tinuous dialogue.  
Similarly to the study presented here, Nakano 
et al (2003) presented a system that describes a 
route to a user in a face-to-face setting. Based on 
studies of human-human interaction, they im-
plemented a model of face-to-face grounding. 
However, they did not provide a detailed analysis 
of the users? behaviour when interacting with 
this system. 
Even if we successfully manage to model hu-
man-like behaviour in a system, it is not certain 
to what extent humans react to these signals 
when interacting with a robot. In the current 
work, we investigate to what extent the robot?s 
gaze can be used to: (1) help the user disambigu-
ate referring expressions to objects in the shared 
visual scene, and (2) to either inhibit or encour-
age different types of user reactions while the 
system pauses or at turn endings. 
2.2 Pauses in the system's speech 
Speakers in dialogue produce speech piece by 
piece as the dialogue progresses. When starting 
to speak, dialogue participants typically do not 
have a complete plan of how to say something or 
even what to say. Yet, they manage to rapidly 
integrate information from different sources in 
parallel and simultaneously plan and realize new 
dialogue contributions (Levelt, 1989). Still, 
pauses occur frequently within utterances and it 
has been shown that these play a significant role 
in human-human dialogue (for an overview, see 
Rochester, 1973). For example, the timing and 
duration of pauses have important structural 
functions (Goldman-Eisler, 1972), pauses (filled 
and silent) are associated with high cognitive 
load and planning difficulties (Brennan & Wil-
liams, 1995), and whether a pause is detected or 
not does not only depend on duration but also on 
its linguistic context (Boomer & Dittmann, 
1962). 
Recently, several studies have looked into the 
possibilities of replicating the incremental behav-
iour of humans in human-machine interaction. 
Work on incremental speech generation has fo-
cused on the underlying system architecture 
(Schlangen & Skantze, 2011), how to incremen-
tally react to events that occur while realizing an 
utterance (Dohsaka & Shimazu, 1997, 
Buschmeier et al, 2012), and how to make the 
incremental processes more efficient in order to 
reduce the system?s response time (e.g. Dethlefs 
et al, 2012). In a recent study, we implemented a 
model of incremental speech generation in a dia-
logue system (Skantze & Hjalmarsson, 2012). By 
allowing the system to generate and synthesize 
the response segment by segment, the system 
could start to speak before the processing of the 
input was complete. However, if a system seg-
ment was delayed for some reason, the system 
generated a response based on the information 
obtained so far or by generating a pause (filled or 
unfilled). The system also employed self-repairs 
when the system needed to revise an already re-
alised speech segment. Despite these disfluencies 
(filled pauses and self-repairs), an evaluation of 
the system showed that in comparison to a non-
incremental version, the incremental version had 
a shorter response time and was perceived as 
more efficient by the users. 
However, pauses do not only have to be a 
side-effect of processing delays. Pauses could 
also be used wisely to chunk longer instructions 
into shorter segments, giving the user enough 
164
time to process the information. In this case, the 
system should instead invite user reactions dur-
ing the course of its utterance. In the current 
work, we investigate to what extent the system 
can use filled pauses, syntactic completeness and 
gaze as cues to either inhibit or encourage the 
user to react when the system pauses.  
3 Human-robot Map Task data 
Map Task is a well establish experimental para-
digm for collecting data on human-human dia-
logue [30]. Typically, an instruction-giver has a 
map with landmarks and a route, and is given the 
task of describing this route to an instruction-
follower, who has a similar map but without the 
route drawn on it. In a previous study, (Skantze, 
2012) we used this paradigm for collecting data 
on how humans elicit feedback in human-
computer dialogue. In that study, the human was 
the instruction-giver. In the current study, we use 
the same paradigm for a human-robot dialogue, 
but here the robot is the instruction-giver and the 
human is the instruction-follower. This has re-
sulted in a rich multi-modal corpus of various 
types of user reactions to the robot?s instructions, 
which vary across conditions.  
 
Figure 1: The experimental setup. 
3.1 A Map Task dialogue system 
The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. 
The user is seated opposite to the robot head 
Furhat (Al Moubayed et al, 2013), developed at 
KTH. Furhat uses a facial animation model that 
is back-projected on a static mask. The head is 
mounted on a neck (with 3 degrees of freedom), 
which allows the robot to direct its gaze using 
both eye and head movements. The dialogue sys-
tem was implemented using the IrisTK frame-
work developed at KTH (Skantze & Al Mou-
bayed, 2012), which provides a set of modules 
for input and output, including control of Furhat 
(facial gestures, eye and head movements), as 
well as a statechart-based authoring language for 
controlling the flow of the interaction. For 
speech synthesis, we used the CereVoice unit 
selection synthesizer developed by CereProc 
(www.cereproc.com). 
Between the user and the robot lies a large 
map printed on paper. In addition, the user has a 
digital version of the map presented on a screen 
and is given the task to draw the route that the 
robot describes with a digital pen. However, the 
landmarks on the user?s screen are blurred and 
therefore the user also needs to look at the large 
map in order to identify the landmarks. This map 
thereby constitutes a target for joint attention. 
While the robot is describing the route, its gaze is 
directed at the landmarks under discussion (on 
the large map), which should help the user to 
disambiguate between landmarks. In a previous 
study, we have shown that human subjects can 
identify the target of Furhat's gaze with an accu-
racy that is very close to that of observing a hu-
man (Al Moubayed et al, 2013). At certain plac-
es in the route descriptions, the robot also looks 
up at the user. A typical interaction between the 
robot and a user is shown in Table 1. As the ex-
ample illustrates, each instruction is divided into 
two parts with a pause in between, which results 
in four phases per instruction: Part I, Pause, Part 
II and Release. Whereas user responses are not 
mandatory in the Pause phase (the system will 
continue anyway after a short silence threshold, 
as in U.2), the Release requires a verbal re-
sponse, after which the system will continue. We 
have explored three different realisations of 
pauses, which were systematically varied in the 
experiment: 
COMPLETE: Pauses preceded by a syntactically 
complete  phrase (R.5). 
INCOMPLETE: Pauses preceded by a syntactical-
ly incomplete phrase (R.9).  
FILLED: Pauses preceded by a filled pause (R.1). 
The phrase before the filled pause was some-
times incomplete and sometimes complete. 
To make the conditions comparable, the amount 
of information given before the pauses was bal-
anced between conditions. Thus, the incomplete 
phrases still contained an important piece of in-
formation and the pause was inserted in the be-
ginning of the following phrase (as in R.9).

Figure 2: An example map. 
Given the current limitations of conversational 
speech recognition, and lack of data relevant for 
this task, we needed to employ some trick to be 
able to build a system that could engage in this 
task in a convincing way in order to evoke natu-
ral reactions from the user. One possibility would 
be to use a Wizard-of-Oz setup, but that was 
deemed to be infeasible for the time-critical be-
haviour that is under investigation here. Instead, 
we employed a trick similar to the one used in 
(Skantze, 2012). Although the users are told that 
the robot cannot see their drawing behaviour, the 
drawing on the digital map, together with a voice 
activity detector that detects the user?s verbal 
responses, is actually used by the system to se-
lect the next action. An example of a map can be 
seen in Figure 2. On the intended route (which 
obviously is not shown on the user?s screen), a 
number of hidden ?spots? were defined ? posi-
tions relative to some landmark (e.g. ?east of the 
field?). Each instruction from the system was 
intended to guide the user to the next hidden 
spot. Each map also contained an ambiguous 
landmark reference (as ?the tower? in the exam-
ple). 
Pilot studies showed that there were three 
basic kinds of verbal reactions from the user: (1) 
an acknowledgement of some sort, encouraging 
the system to continue, (2) a request for repeti-
tion, or (3) a statement that some misunderstand-
ing had occurred. By combining the length of the 
utterance with the information about the progres-
sion of the drawing, these could be distinguished 
in a fairly robust manner. How this was done is 
shown in Table 2. Notice that this scheme allows 
for both short and long acknowledgements (U.4, 
U.6 and U.12 in the example above), as well as 
clarification requests (U.8). It also allows us to 
explore misunderstandings, i.e. cases where the 
user thinks that she is at the right location and 
makes a short acknowledgement, while she is in 
fact moving in the wrong direction. Such prob-
lems are usually detected and repaired in the fol-
lowing turns, when the system continues with the 
instruction from the intended spot and the user 
objects with a longer response. This triggers the 
system to either RESTART the instruction from a 
previous spot where the user is known to have 
been ("I think that we lost each other, could we 
start again from where you were at the bus 
stop?"), or to explicitly CHECK whether the user 
is at the intended location ("Are you at the bus 
stop?"), which helps the user to correct the path.

the user?s voice activity and drawing.

3.2 Experimental conditions  
In addition to the utterance-level conditions 
(concerning completeness) described above, 
three dialogue-level conditions were implement-
ed:  
CONSISTENT gaze (FACE): The robot gazes at 
the landmark that is currently being described 
during the phases Part I, Pause and Part II. In 
166
accordance with the findings in for example 
Kendon (1967), the robot looks up at the end 
of phase Part II, seeking mutual gaze with the 
user during the Release phase. 
RANDOM gaze (FACE): A random gaze behav-
iour, where the robot randomly shifts between 
looking at the map (at no particular landmark) 
and looking at the user, with an interval of 5-
10 seconds. 
NOFACE: The robot head was hidden behind a 
paper board so that the user could not see it, 
only hear the voice. 
3.3 Data collection and analysis 
We collected a corpus of 24 subjects interacting 
with the system, 20 males and 4 females between 
the ages of 21-47. Although none of them were 
native speakers, all of them had a high proficien-
cy in English. First, each subject completed a 
training dialogue and then six dialogues that 
were used for the analysis. For each dialogue, 
different maps were used. The subjects were di-
vided into three groups with 8 subjects in each:  
Group A: Three maps with the CONSISTENT 
(FACE) version and three maps with the 
NOFACE version. All pauses were 1.5 s. long. 
Group B: Three maps with the RANDOM (FACE) 
version and three maps with the NOFACE ver-
sion. All pauses were 1.5 s. long. 
Group C: Three maps with the CONSISTENT ver-
sion and three maps with the NOFACE ver-
sion. All pauses were 2-4 s. long (varied ran-
domly with a uniform distribution).  
For all groups, the order between the FACE 
and the NOFACE condition was varied and bal-
anced. Group A and Group B allow us to explore 
differences between the CONSISTENT and RAN-
DOM versions. This is important, since it is not 
evident to what extent the mere presence of a 
face affects the interaction and to what extent 
differences are due to a consistent gazing behav-
iour. Group C was added to the data collection 
since we wanted to be able to study users' behav-
iour during pauses in more detail. Thus, Group C 
will only be used to study within-group effects of 
different pause types and will not be compared 
against the other groups.  
After the subjects had interacted with the sys-
tem, they filled out a questionnaire. First, they 
were requested to rate with which version (FACE 
or NOFACE) it was easier to complete the task. 
Second, the participants were requested to rate 
whether the robot?s gaze was helpful or confus-
ing when it came to task completion, landmark 
identification and the timing of feedback. All 
ratings were done on a continuous horizontal line 
with either FACE or ?the gaze was helpful? on 
the left end and NOFACE or ?the gaze was con-
fusing? on the right end. The centre of the line 
was labelled with ?no difference?. 
During the experiments, the users? speech and 
face were recorded and all events in the system 
and the drawing activity were automatically 
logged. Afterwards, the users' voice activity that 
had been automatically detected online was 
manually corrected and transcribed. Using the 
video recordings, the users? gaze was also manu-
ally annotated, depending on whether the user 
was looking at the map, the screen or at the ro-
bot.  
 In this study, we also wanted to explore the 
possibility of measuring cognitive load in hu-
man-robot interaction using EDA (electrodermal 
activity). Hence, in an explorative manner, we 
investigated how the realisation of the system?s 
pauses and the presence of the face affected the 
cognitive costs of processing the system?s in-
structions. For measuring this, we used a weara-
ble EDA device, which exerts a direct current on 
the skin of the subject in order to measure skin 
conductance responses. For these measurements 
as well as the logging of the data the Q-Sensor 
developed by Affectiva 1  was used. The meas-
urements were taken from the fingertips of the 
subjects. The sampling rate was 8 Hz. All post 
processing was carried out in Ledalab2. We first 
applied the Butterworth filter and then carried 
out a Continuous Decomposition Analysis. All 
skin conductance responses (SCR) with a mini-
mum amplitude of 0.01 muS and a minimal dis-
tance of 700ms were used for further analysis. 
Due to problems with the EDA device, we only 
have data for six subjects in Group A, six in 
Group B and none in Group C.  
4 Results 
Analyses of the different measures used here re-
vealed that they were not normally distributed. 
We have therefore consistently used non-
parametric tests. All tests of significance are 
done using two-tailed tests at the .05 level.

4.1 Subjective ratings 
The questionnaire was used to analyse differ-
ences in subjective ratings between Group A and 
B. The marks on the horizontal continuous lines 
in the questionnaire were measured with a ruler 
based on their distance from the midpoint (la-
belled with ?no difference?) and normalized to a 
scale between 0 and 1. A Wilcoxon Signed 
Ranks Test was carried out, using these rankings 
as differences. The results show that the Con-
sistent version differed significantly from the 
midpoint (?no difference?) in four dimensions 
whereas there were no significant differences 
from the midpoint for RANDOM version. More 
specifically, Group A (CONSISTENT) (n=8) found 
it easier to complete the task in the face condi-
tion than in the no face condition (Mdn=0.88, 
Z=-2.54, p=.012). The same group thought that 
the robot?s gaze was helpful rather than confus-
ing when it came to task completion (Mdn=0.84, 
Z=-2.38, p=.017), landmark identification 
(Mdn=0.83, Z=-2.52, p=.012) and to decide 
when to give feedback (Mdn=0.66, Z=-1.99, 
p=.046). The results of the questionnaire are pre-
sented in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3: The results from the questionnaire. The 
bars show the median rating for Group A (con-
sistent) and Group B (random). 
4.2 Task completion 
Apart from the subjective ratings, we also want-
ed to see whether the face-to-face setting affect-
ed task completion. In order to explore this, we 
analysed the time and number of utterances it 
took for the users to complete the maps. On av-
erage, the dialogues in Group A (CONSISTENT) 
were 2.5 system utterances shorter and 8.9 sec-
onds faster in the FACE condition than in the 
NOFACE condition. For Group B (RANDOM), the 
dialogues were instead 2.3 system utterances and 
17.3 seconds longer in the FACE condition 
(Mann-Whitney U-test, p<.05). Thus, it seems 
like the face facilitates the solving of the task, 
and that this is not just due to the mere presence 
of a face, but that the intelligent gaze behaviour 
actually contributes. In fact, the RANDOM gaze 
worsens the performance, possibly because sub-
jects spent time on trying to make sense of sig-
nals that did not provide any useful information. 
Looking at more local phenomena, it seems 
like there was also a noticeable difference when 
it comes to miscommunication. The dialogues in 
the RANDOM/FACE condition had a total of 18 
system utterances of the type RESTART (vs. 7 in 
CONSISTENT), and a total of 33 CHECK utteranc-
es (vs. 15 in CONSISTENT). A chi-square test 
shows that the differences are statistically signif-
icant (?2(1, N=25) = 4.8, p =.028; ?2(1, N=48) = 
6.75, p=.009). This indicates that the users that 
did not get the CONSISTENT gaze to a larger ex-
tent did not manage to follow the system?s in-
structions, most likely because they did not get 
guidance from the robot?s gaze in disambiguat-
ing referring expressions. 
4.3 Gaze behaviour 
In order to analyse the users? direction of atten-
tion during the dialogues, the manual annotation 
of the participants? gaze was analysed. First, we 
explored how the completion type of the robot's 
utterance affected the users? gaze. In this analy-
sis, FILLED and INCOMPLETE have been merged 
(since there was no difference in the users? gaze 
between these conditions). The percentage of 
gaze at the robot over the four different utterance 
phases for complete and incomplete utterances is 
plotted in Figure A in the Appendix. Note that 
the different phases actually are of different 
lengths depending on the actual content of the 
utterance and the length of the pause. However, 
these lengths have been normalized in order to 
make it possible to analyse the average user be-
haviour. For each phase, a Mann-Whitney U-test 
was conducted. The results show that the per-
centage of gaze at Furhat during the mid-
utterance pause is higher when the first part of 
the utterance is incomplete than when it is com-
plete (U=7573.0, p<.001). There were, however, 
no significant differences in gaze direction be-
tween complete and incomplete utterance during 
the other three phases (p>.05). This indicates that 
users gaze at the robot to elicit a continuation of 
the instruction when it is incomplete. 
Second, we wanted to explore if gaze direction 
can be used as a cue of whether the user will 
provide a verbal response in the pause or not.

without user response in the pause is plotted in 
Figure B in the Appendix. For each phase, a 
Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted. The re-
sults show that the percentage of gaze at Furhat 
during the mid-utterance pause (U=1945.5, 
p=.008) and Part II (U=2090.0, p=.008) of the 
utterance is lower when the user gives a verbal 
response compared to when there is no response. 
There were however no significant differences in 
gaze direction between complete and incomplete 
utterance during the other two phases (p>.05). 
4.4 Verbal feedback behaviour 
Apart from the user?s gaze behaviour, we also 
wanted to see whether syntactic completeness 
before pauses had an effect on whether the users 
gave verbal responses in the pause. Figure 4 
shows the extent to which users gave feedback 
within pauses, depending on pause type and 
FACE/NOFACE condition. As can be seen, COM-
PLETE triggers more feedback, FILLED less feed-
back and INCOMPLETE even less. Interestingly, 
this difference is more distinct in the FACE con-
dition (?2(2, N=157) = 10.32, p<.01). In fact, the 
difference is not significant in the NOFACE con-
dition (p >.05).

pause type (Group C). 
In Skantze et al (2013), we have also done a 
more thorough analysis of the verbal acknowl-
edgements from the users. The analysis shows 
that the prosody and lexical choice in these 
acknowledgements ("okay", "yes", "yeah", 
"mm", "mhm", "ah", "alright" and "oh") to some 
extent signal whether the drawing activity is 
about to be initiated or has been completed. The 
analysis also shows how these parameters are 
correlated to the perception of uncertainty. 
4.5 Drawing behaviour 
Whereas gaze and verbal responses can be re-
garded as communicative signals, the users were 
told that the robot could not observe their draw-
ing activity. However, the drawing of the route 
can be regarded as the purpose of the interaction 
and it is therefore important to understand how 
this is affected by the system?s behaviour under 
different conditions. First, we wanted to see how 
the completeness of the robot's utterance in com-
bination with the presence of the face affected 
the drawing activity. In this analysis, FILLED and 
INCOMPLETE have been merged (since there was 
no clear difference). The mean drawing activity 
over the four phases of the descriptions is plotted 
in Figure C in the Appendix. For each phase, a 
Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted showing that 
there is a significant difference between the con-
ditions in the Pause phase (H(3) = 28.8, p<.001). 
Post-hoc tests showed that FACE/INCOMPLETE 
has a lower drawing activity than the other con-
ditions, and that NOFACE/INCOMPLETE has a 
lower drawing activity than the COMPLETE con-
dition. Thus, INCOMPLETE phrases before pauses 
seem to have an inhibiting effect on the user?s 
drawing activity in general, but this effect ap-
pears to be much larger in the FACE condition. 
Second, we aimed to investigate to what ex-
tent the robot?s gaze at landmarks during ambig-
uous references helps users to discriminate be-
tween landmarks.  The mean drawing activity 
over the four phases of the descriptions of am-
biguous landmarks is plotted in Figure D in the 
Appendix. For each phase, a Kruskal-Wallis test 
was conducted showing that there is a significant 
difference between the conditions in the Part II 
phase (H(2)=10.2, p=.006). Post-hoc tests 
showed that CONSISTENT has a higher drawing 
activity than the RANDOM and NOFACE condi-
tions. However, there is no such difference when 
looking at non-ambiguous descriptions. This 
shows that robot?s gaze at the target landmark 
during ambiguous references makes it possible 
for the subjects to start to draw quicker.  
4.6 Cognitive load 
As mentioned above, we also wanted to study the 
cognitive costs of processing the system?s in-
structions, as measured with a wearable EDA 
device. For each system utterance part (Part I and 
Part II), we calculated the sum of the amplitudes 
of the skin conductance responses (SoSCR) dur-
ing the following three seconds. The SoSCR dur-
ing the pause, depending on pause type are 
shown in Figure 5. A Kruskal-Wallis test re-
vealed that there is an overall effect (H(2)=8.7, 
p=.13), and post-hoc tests showed that there is a 
significant difference between utterances which 
are incomplete and those with filled pauses, indi-
169
cating that the syntactic incompleteness without 
a filled pause leads to a higher cognitive load.  
We have no good explanation for this, and we do 
not know whether this is due to how the syntacti-
cally incomplete segments were realised by the 
synthesizer, or whether the same effect would 
appear in human-human interaction.

and B). 
A similar analysis was done after both Part I and 
Part II to see if there is any difference in SoSCR 
between ambiguous and non-ambiguous refer-
ences in the different conditions, as shown in in 
Figure 6. No such differences were found for 
Group B, but for Group A, ambiguous references 
were followed by a higher SoSCR in the 
NOFACE condition, indicating that the robot?s 
gaze helps in disambiguating the referring ex-
pressions and reduces cognitive load (Mann-
Whitney U-test; U = 6585, p = .001).

5 Conclusions and Discussion 
In this study, we have investigated to what extent 
the robot?s gaze can be used to: (1) help the user 
disambiguate referring expressions to objects in 
the shared visual scene, and (2) to either inhibit 
or encourage different types of user reactions 
while the system pauses. The  results show  that  
the robot?s gaze behaviour  was  rated  as  help-
ful  rather  than  confusing for  task completion,  
landmark  identification and feedback timing. 
These effects were not present when the robot 
used a random gaze behaviour. The efficiency of 
the gaze was further supported by the time it 
took to complete the task and the number of mis-
understandings. These results in combination 
with a faster drawing activity and lower cogni-
tive load when system?s reference was ambigu-
ous, suggest that the users indeed utilized the 
system?s gaze to discriminate between land-
marks.  
The second purpose of this study was to inves-
tigate to what extent filled pauses, syntactic 
completeness and gaze can be used as cues to 
either inhibit or encourage the user to react in 
pauses. First, the results show that pauses pre-
ceded by incomplete syntactic segments or filled 
pauses appear to inhibit user activity. Thus, our 
analyses of gaze and drawing activity show that 
users give less feedback, draw less and look at 
the robot to a larger extent when the preceding 
system utterance segment is incomplete than 
when it is complete. An interesting observation is 
that the inhibiting effect on drawing activity ap-
pears to be more pronounced in the face-to-face 
condition, which indicates that gaze also plays an 
important role here (since the robot looked down 
at the map during the pauses). Additionally, there 
is less cognitive load when the silence is preced-
ed by a filled pause. These results suggest that 
incomplete system utterances prevent further 
user processing; instead the user waits for more 
input from the system before starting to carry out 
the system?s instruction. After complete utter-
ance segments, however, there is more drawing 
activity and the user looks less at the robot, sug-
gesting that the user has already started to carry 
out the system?s instruction. 
The results presented in this study have impli-
cations for generating multimodal behaviours 
incrementally in dialogue systems for human-
robot interaction. Such a system should be able 
to generate speech and gaze intelligently in order 
to inhibit or encourage the user to act, depending 
on the state of the system's processing. In future 
studies, we plan to extend our previous model of 
incremental speech generation (Skantze & 
Hjalmarsson, 2012) with such capabilities.
