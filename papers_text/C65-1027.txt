ABSTRACT 
TOSH 
The following paper discusses the preparation of 
syntactic data for use in a generalized language transla- 
tion systemj developed by the Linguistics Research Center 
at The University of Texas. Capabilities and limitations 
of translation by syntactic model are outlined and compared 
with the word-for-word model.

BACKGROUND 
In January  o f  th i s  year  the  L ingu is t i cs  Research  
Center  he ld  i t s  f i r s t  demonst ra t ion  of  an operat iona l  system 
for  exper imenta l  t rans la t ion  oF languages .  We prepared  n 
l im i ted  set  of  tes t  data  and used a pre -se lec ted  input  text  
to  demonst ra te  the  operat iona l  s ta tus  o f  computer  programs 
in the system. I shall discuss briefly the model on which 
the translation system is based and the preparation of lin- 
1 guistic data used in the demonstration. 
LINGUISTICS RESEARCtl CENTER 
Two pr inc ipa l  ob iec t ives  at  the  L ingu is t i cs  
Research  Center  have been the  deve lopment  o f  a genera l i zed  
automat ic  t rans la t iun  system and the  deve lopment  of  a l in -  
gu is t i cs  computer  system cons is t ing  o f  programs des igned 
to fac i l i ta te  the  co l lec t ion  and maintenance  of  data  fo r  
the  t rans la t ion  system \ [7 \ ] .  In add i t ion  to  these  ob jec -  
t i ves ,  we have under taken  re la ted  s tud ies  in  in fo rmat ion  
re t r ieva l  and automat ic  c lass i f i ca t ion  \[1, 2\ ] .  The ph i l -  
osophy beh ind  our research  e f fo r t  may be character i zed  as 
one of seeking general solutions to language description 
and translation as opposed to one of designing specialized 
TOSH 2 
algorithms. The general principles underlying our research 
have beBn discussed elsewhere) and I shall not dwell on them 
here \[4; 5; 6; 8, pp. 3-14; 9\]. 
Three organizational subdivisions of the Center 
are the Theoretical Linguistics Group, the Descriptive Lin- 
guistics Group and the Systems Group. Activities at the 
Center are distributed over these and other specialized 
are:~s in order to facilitate research. Results reported 
in this paper are presented from the point of view of acti- 
2 vities in the Descriptive Linguistics Group. 
The Descriptive Linguistics Group is currently 
engaged in maintaining research data in six languages: 
Chinese, English, German, Hebrew) Russian and Spanish. 
We are also maintaining data for independent) non-supported 
rescarch in Hindi and Old Saxon. We have just begun main- 
taining data for Japanese. Plans are being made to add 
French to the data in the Linguistics Research System in 
the near future. 
LINGUISTICS RESEARCII SYSTEM 
The Linguistics Research System is a hierarchical 
system of computer programs) which, in addition to programs 
in the experimental translation system, includes programs de- 
signed to support a stratified description of language data 
TOSH 3 
(see fo ld -out  ent i t led  LINGUISTICS RESEARCH SYSTE~). In 
the  i l l us t ra t ion  the  la rge  boxes marked k~AINTAINANCE at  
the  upper  and lower par t  o f  the  page represent  the  system 
of  p rograms in which we co l lec t  and mainta in  language and 
descr ip t ive  l ingu is t i c  data .  The system of  la rge  boxes 
runn ing  across  the  midd le  of  the  page represents  the  
t rans la t ion  sys tem.  Deta i l s  o f  these  programs w i l l  be 
found in \[8, pp. 83 -103\ ] .  I out l ine  the  funct ions  of  p ro -  
grams in the translation system below. 
TRANSLATION ~!ODELS 
Var ious  models  have been proposed  for  automat ic  
t rans la t ion  of  languages .  The models have been character -  
i zed  in to  at  leas t  th ree  leve ls  o f  inc reas ing  complex i ty  
and soph is t i ca t ion :  1. Word- fo r -word ,  2. Ru le - fo r - ru le  
or syntact i c ,  3. T rans format iona l - semant ic .  The inade-  
quac ies  of  type  1. a re  known. ~lest of  cur rent  invest ipa -

1. and 2. 
In model 1. we may per fo rm word- fo r -word  t rans -  
la t ion  by present ing  an input  corpus  (see fo ld -out )  to  
TOSH 4 
the LEXICAL ANALYSIS program. Analysis results in recog- 
nition of whatever forms have been defined in the lexical 
grammar. The results are transferred from the analysis 
program in ~ONOLINGUAL RECOGNITION to the LEXICAL ANALYSIS 
program in INTERLINGUAL RECOGNITION. Intermediate display 
programs are ordinarily by-passed in the translation mode. 
The data then pass to an INPUT TRANSFER tape before enter- 
ing the TRANSFER program. This program processed INPUT 
TRANSFER data against data from the INTERLINGUA tape to 
produce an OUTPUT TRANSFER tape. OUTPUT TRANSFER data 
pass into the LEXICAL SYNTIIESIS program in INTERLINGUAL 
PRODUCTION to be converted to an acceptable form for in- 
put to LEXICAL SYNTIIESIS in HONOLINGUAL PRODUCTION. The 
resulting data pass on to the OUTPUT CORPUS tape which 
serves as input to the CORPUS DISPLAY program. 
Output from this lowest level of translation 
would be word-for-word, morph-for-morph, etc. matching 
the order of input forms. There would be no control 
over output morphology or syntax. We have not considered 
it worthwhile to attempt to use model I. translation inde- 
pendently of model 2. 
Model 2. translation in the Linguistics Research 
System performs in a fashion operationally similar to model 
i. Instead of operating (horizontally on the fold-out) 
directly through the lexical level, however, we initiate 
TOSH 5 
the translation input in LEXICAL ANALYSIS and pass the 
resulting data (vertically) into SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS. 
Model 2. translation now continues horizontally on the 
syntactic level analogously to the manner described for 
tile lexical level. 
Output resulting from the syntactic transla- 
tion model observes the requirements for well-formedness 
in output language morphology and syntax. Examples from 
the January demonstration are given below. With large 
volumes of grammar data, this model is not expected to 
provide all the semantic collocational controls which we 
as linguists will want to maintain. Nor will it properly 
account for problems such as pronominal reference. These 
and other transformational problems will be dealt with in 
a still higher order of description and programming. The 
semantic order of programming has only recently been 
undertaken. 
The translation model used in the January demon- 
stration is essentially a type 2. model, although it con- 
tains some features proposed for type 5. models. Analysis 
is performed on the input language with a context-free 
phrase structure grammar. The structures which are thus 
identified are transformed into equivalent output language 
structures by the so-called transfer grammar. Translation 
output is then generated through a context-free phrase 
structure grammar o? the output language \[15\]. 
TOStl 6 
Rules fo r  use in a s imi la r  model are g iven by 
I l se  Langerhans \ [3 \ ] .  The essent ia l  d i f fe rence ,  however,  
between our model and that  proposed by Langerhans is  
that  in the la t te r  the input  language is  ana lyzed  in to  
kerne ls ,  the kerne ls  matched with equ iva lent  output  lan -  
guage kerne ls ,  and the output  language kerne ls  t rans formed 
in to  f in i shed  express ions .  
PREPARATION OF DATA 
For the demonst ra t ion ,  we se lec ted  a text  in 
psycho logy  to use as a tes t  corpus in German, the input  
language (Appendix A). The corpus consisted of the first 
six paragraphs of an essay appearing in UNIVERSITAS \[I0\]. 
Members of our staff then prepared an English translation 
to be used as a test corpus in the output language (Appen- 
dix B). We use test corpora for verifying the morpho- 
syntactic description in each language before attempting 
to use the grammars in the translation system. To illus- 
trate the details of data preparation, I have chosen the 
second sentence from the third paragraph of text (Fig. I). 
This sentence was chosen for reasons of simplicity and 
economy of description. It is typical, however, of trans- 
formational problems in syntactic translation. We pro-

vided a phrase structure description for the sentence, 
labelling those features of construction which would be 
necessary for morpho-syntactic (as opposed semantic) 
grammaticality in German. The description contains, 
therefore, more information than is necessary for recog- 
nition. But we are designing our grammars, in general, 
for bi-directional use. A similar description was pro- 
vided for the English translation (Fig. 2). 
After diagramming each sentence, we encoded 
the information contained ill the diagrams ill an equiva- 
lent phrase structure notation \[14\]. The data were then 
compiled in the computer system. As rules are compiled 
for each language, each rule is randomly assigned a per- 
manent identification number. After the respective 
grammars are compiled and displayed, we refer to them 
for the identification of each rule and record the appro- 
priate number by each occurrence of a rule in the diagram. 
The diagrams then appear as in Figures 3 and 4. 
VERIFICATION OF DATA 
To insure that a description for any given sen- 
tence is complete, we perform analysis on tlle sentence in 
the computer, using the grammar data accumulated up to 
that point. If automatic analysis is successful, we ex-

TRANSLATIONAL TRANS FOR~;IATIONS 
Af ter  we ver i f ied  the  descr ip t ions  in each 
language,  we went on to  de f ine  the  bas is  o f  in ter l in -  
gua l  t rans format ion  re la t ionsh ips .  We se lec ted  a pa i r  
o f  sentences ,  one from each o f  the  two languages .  They 
are de f ined  as equ iva lent  in  meaning by b i - l ingua l  in -  
fo rmants .  Given the  pa i r  o f  sentences ,  we mapped cor res -  
pond ing  sub-s t ruc tures  from one sentence  on to the  o ther .  
Th is  in fo rmat ion  was recorded  on the  d iagrams by c i rcum-  
sc r ib ing  the  sub-s t ruc tures  (F ig .  S) .  Normal ly  these  
l ines  a re  added d i rec t ly  to the  d iagrams.  For the  sake 
of  s imp l i c i ty ,  I have omi t ted  branch ing  d iagrams and 
c lass  names from the  i l l us t ra t ions .  A f te r  we es tab l i shed  
the  cor respondences  between each pa i r  of  sub-s t ruc tures ,  
we inspected  each sub-s t ruc ture  to see of  what i t  was 
TOStt 13 
composed. I have represented this information in Figures 
6 and 7 by the rule number(s) contained in each sub-structure. 
Suppose now we want to "transforms" i.e.~ trans- 
late the expression Bewusstsein into the expression con- 
sciousness. Bewusstsein (Figs. 3, 6) is represented by 
the rule 
42321: NIOW ? Bewusstsein 
Consciousness (Figs. 4, 7) is  represented  by the ru le  
27951: NSF ? consc iousness  
We def ine  the equiva lence of these two express ions  by 
wr i t ing  the b i -d i rec t iona l  t rans format ion  Tx: 
\[42321\]g + T x + \[27951\] e 
This is equivalent to writing a reversible transformation 
between the structures of Figure R.

Similarly, we may translate from an infinitive 
construction in the one language into a corresponding 
construction in the other. The infinitive of umschreib- 
is formed with -en by the rule

to define the translation equivalence. This is equivalent 
to writing the transformation in Figure 9.

Tile foregoing examples are typical of the many rule-for- 
rule correspondences to be found in a pair of structurally 
similar languages. 
Of greater interest are those transformations 
of pairs of structures which are dissimilar in terms of 
constituent rules. In Figure 6 the sub-string kann (man) 
nicht (naeher umschreiben) is analyzed in part by the 
rule sequence 10234 + 10241 + 1035 + 626. The sub-string 
consists, furthermore, of a subject-verb inversion char- 
acteristic of German syntax. We may transform this con- 
struction of four rules into the corresponding English 
construction (Fig. 7) of three rules $33 + 466 + 28792 
by writing the transformation Tz: 
\[10234 + 10241 + 1035 + 626\] ~ T ? \ [533  + 466  + 28792\] g z e 
This is equivalent to writing a transformation on the 
structures in Figure iO.

TRANSLATION OUTPUT 
After all translation data have been collected 
and compiled for a given test corpus, the next step is to 
verify the data in the computer system by attempting to 
carry out automatic translation. As in the case of auto- 
matic analysis, we expect translation output corresponding 
at least to the target language structures for which we 
have set up translation rules. That is, we expect in the 
case of successful translation an output which resembles 
within satisfactory limits the human translation given as 
the ideal goal. There may be, in addition, various alter- 
native paraphrases, but the content should be essentially 
the same. The more likely case in the beginning stages, 
naturally, is partial success mixed with failure. 
Our first output for German to English transla- 
tion is given in Appendix C. The unsatisfactory quality 
TOSll 18 
in this example is the result of a combination of program 
errors and inadequate linguistic data. Word-for-word out- 
put would produce results quite similar to this sample. 
Receiving such results, we referred back to the appropri- 
ate sentence diagrams and lists of translation rules to 
reconstruct the rules necessary for we11-formed output. 
A subsequent run with the needed additional translation 
3 rules is displayed in Appendix D. 
If we compare the computer translation (Appendix 
D) with tile human translation (Appendix B), they appear 
quite similar at first glance, as indeed we should hope 
they would be. A closer inspection, however, reveals 
numerous differences. Some of these result from weak- 
nesses in description as limited by the model, while some 
result from the alternatives implicit in the descriptive 
data -- alternatives which the model is designed to cope 
with. 
In the first or title paragraph, the German 
title is constructed in the framework of a prepositional 
phrase beginning with ueber. Since the human translation 
was prepared without a preposition, transformation rules 
were set up to delete the preposition accordingly in the 
computer version of the English output. This is probably 
not advisable, however, since in the syntactic model there 
TOStl 19 
is no satisfactory way to distinguish contextually a 
prepositional phrase functioning as a title from its 
other uses. The implication is, then, that we should re- 
formulate our transformation for this context to produce 
an English preposition like on. 
The human and machine translations are identi- 
cal in the first sentence o? paragraph I denoted by the 
numbers 74 001 in the left margin (Appendices A, B, D). 
The German adverb allein, which is an element in the rela- 
tive clause modifying the subject-noun head, has been 
transformed into the English adverb only, which now is 
a member of the corresponding English subject-noun head 
construction and not an element of the following relative 
clause. For the German clause das Problem...so verzwei~t, 
we have transformed into the corresponding English clause 
the problem...so complex, inserting a copula verb i__ss. 
Finally, in the last clause of the German sentence there 
is a passive construction which has been transformed into 
an equivalent English active construction. There are 
transformations of similar complexity throughout the re- 
mainder of the corpus. 
There is an interesting difference between the 
last sentence of the human translation of paragraph I and 
the machine translation. In the human translation the 
sentence ends ...problem of a dependence of mental pro- 
cesses on the bed Z. In the machine translation the sen-

tence  ends . . .p rob lem of  a phys ica l  dependence  o f  menta l  
p rocesses .  A l though a l l  the  necessary  grammar ru les  and 
t rans format ions  were ava i lab le  to  the  t rans la t ion  sys tem 
for  p roduc ing  an output  ident i ca l  w i th  that  o f  the  human 
translation, it is interesting that the system picked 
instead an alternative paraphrase (and a potential ly con- 
fusing one) which was more similar to the syntax of the 
original German input. The system's choice was made on 
the basis of certain probabil ity parameters available to 
it and with which we are in continual experimentation. 
It is not surprising that the system selected such an 
alternative, for we expect such to be the case in the pre- 
sent model. What is interesting, however, is the fact 
that a choice was available even within the limited data 
set which we prepared for these few paragraphs. For this 
experiment the system had available to it dictionary data 
for the entire article of 52 paragraphs. With respect to 
syntactic data, however, it was quite limited since we 
supplied just the rules necessary to carry out analysis 
and/or synthesis of the six paragraphs involved in the 
experiment. Furthermore, we had limited ourselves in the 
transformation data to a choice of one syntactic output 
for each sentence -- the output identical with that of 
the human translation. Nonetheless, it is evident that 
in this small data set there are already sufficient 
TOSIt 22 
implicit relationships to permit unplanned for if not 
unexpected paraphrases. 
LIMITATIONS IN THE MODEL 
Paragraph  2 o f  Appendix D conta ins  probab ly  t i le 
most f requent  and character i s t i c  examples  o f  dev ia t ion

aber rant  p ronomina l  fo rms.  S ince  German conta ins  the  forms

these  :forms are  u l t inate ly  cor re la tab le  w i th  a l l  forms of  
Eng l i sh  he,  she ,  i t ,  i t  fo l lows  that  we may generate  any 
one of the  Eng l i sh  th i rd  s ingu lar  p ronouns  from any one o f  
the  German th i rd  s ingu lar  p ronouns .  In the  model p resented  
hcre ,  we have not ,  fo r  ins tance ,  c lass i f ied  nouns on the  
bas is  of  such features  as gender ,  an imateness ,  concreteness ,  
e tc .  Thus,  in  the  f i r s t  sentence  o f  paragraph  2, we have 
not  c lass i f ied  e i ther  reader  or b ra in  as to re ferent ia l  
gender .  Consequent ly ,  a t  the  moment when the  t rans la t ion

form of )  a l l  th ree  th i rd  s ingu lar  p ronouns .  Which one i s  
generated  depends  on which ru le  has the  h ighest  p robab i l i ty  
va lue ,  in  th i s  case  the  ru le  produc ing  the  express ion  ij.t, 
s ince  th i s  i s  the  most f requent  of  the  pronouns  in the text .  
I t  i s  not  c lear  that  the proper  cho ice  o f  Eng l i sh  
pronoun gender  cou ld  be spec i f ied  even i f  we inc luded  in  
the  syntact i c  descr ip t ion  such features  as gender ,  an imate -  
ness ,  e tc .  For some ins tances  o f  p ronoun-antecedent  agree-  
ment will remain ambiguous, given two or more antecedents. 
The ambiguity occasionally cannot be resolved without resort 
to reference to the extra-linguistic environment. The first 
sentence of paragraph 2 is perhaps a case in point. Given 
the general context of psychology in which the test corpus 
was written, it is conceivable that either the pronoun he 
or it could refer back to the appropriate respective ante- 
cedents reader or brain. 
In those cases where pronoun-antecedent agreement 
can be stated within the linguistic environment, we should 
of course be prepared to build such features as gender, 
animateness, concreteness, countableness, and a host of 
other such features into our grammars--features which have 
been difficult to account for systematically before the 
advent of stratificational, tagmemic and transformational 
techniques. 
TOSt.! 24 
In the  grammars we have under taken  so fa r  fo r  
the  severa l  languages ,  we have tended to exc lude  such

EXPANDING THE MODEL 
We sha l l  inc lude  features  such as lex ica l  co l -  
l ocat ion  (agent -ac t ion  agreement )  and t rans format ions  of  
semant ic  equ iva lence  in a sys temat ic  descr ip t ion  o f  a 
h igher  o rder  which presupposes  a morpho-syntact i c  descr ip -  
t ion  fo r  each language \[8, pp. 65-71 \ ] .  The fo l low ing  
ana logy  might  be drawn: jus t  as s t r ings  o f  a lphabet ic  and 
o ther  characters  are  taken  as a body of  data  to  be parsed  
and c lass i f ied  by a phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar, we may re -  
gard the s t r ing  o f  ru le  numbers generated  from a phrase  
s t ruc ture  ana lys i s  as a s t r ing  of  symbols  to  be parsed  
and c lass i f ied  in a s t i l l  h igher  o rder  grammar \[11; 13, 
pp. 67-83\], for which there is as yet no universally 
accepted nomenclature. The term transformational strongly 
suggests itself and is widely used, but the term semantic 
4 may seem more appropriate to others.

PROJECTIONS 
During the coming year  we sha l l  proceed to 
expand syntact i c  descr ip t ion  of a l l  languages  now under 
invest igat ion .  Su f f i c ient  t rans fer  data w i l l  be com- 
p i led  between pa i rs  of  languages  to tes t  the genera l  
va l id i ty  of the model and the genera l  adequacy of the 
system of programs we are now us ing .  Severa l  quest ions  
suggest themselves with respect to limitations of the 
model, among them: I. how large will the syntactic 
description of a language be in terms of rules before 
the grammar converges on the languages, and 2. in what 
ways can we improve the quality of translation by using 
a more soih\[sticated model, say one in which there is 
a grammar of structural semantics? We shall be occupied 
primarily with these two questions in an e~fort to anti- 
cipate the need for modifying elements of the transla- 
tion programs and in an effort to test empirically with a 
comprehensive data base some of the more recent theories 
and notions of linguistics.

2. Recognition is due the entire LRC staff) present and

the linguists who contributed more immediately to the 
underlying data are: T. Baker, T. Git) M. Prince) 
K. Ryan) R. Stachowitz, A. Staves, C. Swinburn. In= 
tensive preparation of test data for the demonstra- 
tion covered the period from August) 1964 to January) 
1965. General research and development of programs 
have been under way since May) 19S9. 
3. On comparing the computer and human versions of the 
English translation with the German version, the 
reader is reminded that nowhere are any corpus data 
stored explicitly in the translation system of programs. 
Only raw corpus data in the source language are fed in 
as input to the analysis programs in the system. The 
analysis and synthesis programs use grammatical des- 
criptions in both languages with attendant transfor- 
mation/translation rules to produce output in the 
target language from the analysis-transfer-synthesis 
cycle. 
4. Perhaps a passing observation is in order. The term 
transformational) borrowed from mathematics) is a 
term generally applicable to any process of mapping 
equivalences of one structure onto another and so 
is applicable to all levels of linguistic description.

THE ONLY BODILY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS IS POSSIBLE 
ARE QUITE DIVERSE AND THE PROBLEM OF CONNECTING THE PSYCHIC WITH 
THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BRAIN IS SO COMPLEX THAT IN AN ESSAY ONE CAN 
ONLY SELECT A PARTIAL PROBLEM. THE SUBJECT TO BE CONSIDERED HERE 
REPRESENTS (IN MY OPINION) THE MOST ESSENTIAL PROBLEM OF A 
DEPENDENCE OF MENTAL PROCESSES ON THE BODY. 
THE CONDITION OF THE READERI6/S BRAIN AT THIS MOMENT WHEN HE HAS 
DECIDED TO CONSIDER WITH THE AUTHOR SUCH A COMPLICATED SUBJECT IS 
THAT OF WAKEFUL ATTENTIVENESS. IN ITp I .E .  IN THAT PART OF HIS 
PERSON WHICH HE CALLS HIS ~5~EGO~5/ AND WHICH AT THIS MOMENT IS 
OPEN TO HIS SELF-OBSERVATICN, HE NOW DISCOVERS A SERIES OF 
REFLECTIONS, WHICH ARE PARTLY IDENTICAL WITH THE AUTHOR/61S 
REFLECTIONS AT THE TIME THIS ESSAY WAS WRITTEN. PARTLY~ HIS 
THOUGHTS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM THE AUTHOR/6/St WHICH IS 
UNDERSTANDABLE MERELY THRCUGH THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR PRODUCED 
THESE THOUGHTS, AND FURTHERMORE CONSIDERS THEM CORRECT, WHILE THE 
READER IS THE RECEIVING PARTY AND THEREFORE THE /5/MEDITATOR,/5/ 
AND~ HOPEFULLY, DOES NOT IN THE PROCESS LOSE THE COMPULSION TO 
EXAMINE WHAT HE IS BEING TOLD AS TO ITS CORRECTNESS. 
ALL THIS/ HOWEVER, PROCEEDS IN THE READER AS /5/CONSCIOUSNESS,/5/ 
.I.E. IN THAT AREA WHERE /S/HE HIMSELFI51 IS AT HOME.~ 
CONSCIOUSNESS IS, ONE CANNOT FURTHER CIRCUMSCRIBE'ITHERE IS NO 
MEANS CF DESCRIPTION FOR SOMETHING WHICH ITSELF PRECEDES ANY 
DESCRIPTION OF ALL THINGS. EVERYTHING WE DESCRIBE CONSISTS OF 
PROCESSES WHICH HAVE FIRST ENGRAVED THEIR TRACES IN OUR 
CONSCIOUSNESS. 
IF WE LET OUR ATTENTION ROAM ABOUT FOR A MOMENT IN THE ROOM IN 
WHICH WE ARE SITTING/I/ MAYBE WE NOW HEAR THE TICKING OF A CLOCK, 
THE PEAL OF A BELL MAY REACH OUR EARS FROM OUTSIDE, OR A CHILD 
BABBLES TO HIMSELF . . .  NOTHING OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED EARLIER. IF WE 
ARE ATTENTIVE READERS, WE WILL FORGET EVERYTHING AROUND US/ MAYBE 
NOT ALWAYS WITH A SCIENTIFIC TEXT LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE SUCH 
CONCENTRATION WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT. BUT WHO DOES NOT KNOW 
THE READER OF A DETECTIVE STORY WHO, LOST IN HIMSELF, FORGETS THE 
WORLD . . .  EVEN THE THUNDER OF THE SUBWAY WHICH HE WANTED TO TAKE 
AND WHICH NOW THE STARTLED READER, JUMPING UP, HAS ALREADY MISSED. 
THIS SHORT JOINT REFLECTION HAS BEEN A KIND OF EXPERIMENT WITH 
OURSELVES IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THREE CONCEPTS/L/ CONSCIOUSNESS, 
I .E .  ThAT WHICH WE FIND DIRECTLY IN OURSELVES/2/ ATTENTIVENESS AS 
A TERM FOR A FORCE WHICH IS AT FIRST INEXPLICABLE, WHICH DRAWS 
AWAY OUR CONSCIOUSNESS FROM MOST OBJECTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND

SUBSECUENTLY ABOUT THAT WHICH TOOK PLACE AROUND OUR ABSORBED 
READER WHILE HE WAS READING THE DETECTIVE STORY, HE WILL REMEMBER 
SOME THINGSj IF ONLY DIMLY SO. IN CERTAIN CASES SUCH MEMORY TRACES 
MAY BE ILLUMINATED EVEN FURTHER UNDER HYPNOSIS AND MAY BE RAISED

74 THE PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF CONSCIOUSNESS {ESSAY BY PROF. 
DR. HANS SCHAEFER, UNIVERSITY OF HEIDELBERG, IN I I I  UNIVERSITAS, 
OCTOBER 1959, VOLUME 14, NUMBER i0, PAGES 1079 - IOgO.) 
THE ONLY BODILY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS IS 
POSSIBLE ARE QUITE DIVERSE AND THE PROBLEM OF CONNECTING THE 
PSYCHIC WITH THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BRAIN IS $0 COMPLEX THAT IN AN 
ESSAY ONE CAN ONLY SELECT A PARTIAL PROBLEM. THE SUBJECT TO BE 
CONSIDERED HERE REPRESENTS {IN MY OPINION) THE MOST ESSENTIAL 
PROBLEM OF A PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE OF MENTAL PROCESSES. 
I THE CONDITION OF THE READER/6/S BRAIN AT THIS MOMENT WHEN IT 
HAS DECIDED TO CONSIDER WITH THE AUTHOR SUCH A COMPLICATED 
SUBJECT IS THAT OF WAKEFUL ATTENTIVENESS. IN IT, I .E .  IN THAT 
PART OF ITS PERSON WHICH IT CALLS ITS /5/EG0/5/ AND WHICH AT THIS 
MOMENT IS OPEN TO ITS SELF-OBSERVATION, IT NOW DISCOVERS A SERIES 
OF REFLECTIONS, WHICH ARE PARTLY IDENTICAL WITH THE AUTHORI61S 
REFLECTIONS AT THE TIME WHEN THIS ESSAY WAS WRITTEN. PARTLY, ITS 
THOUGHTS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM THE AUTHOR/6/S, WHICH IS 
UNDERSTANDABLE MERELY THROUGH THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR PRODUCED 
THESE THOUGHTS, AND FURTHERMORE CONSIDERS THEM CORRECT, WHILE THE 
READER IS THE RECEIVING PARTY AND THEREFORE THE /5/MEDITATOR,/5/ 
AND~ HOPEFULLY, DOES NOT IN THE PROCESS LOSE THE COMPULSION TO 
EXAMINE WHAT HE IS BEING TOLD AS TO ITS CORRECTNESS. 
ALL THIS, HOWEVER, PROCEEDS IN THE READER AS 
~5~CONSCIOUSNESS,~5/ I.E. IN THAT AREA WHERE /5/HE HIMSELF/5/ IS 
AT HOME. IWHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS, ONE CANNOT FURTHER 
CIRCUMSCRIBE. I THERE IS NO MEANS OF DESCRIPTION FOR SOMETHING 
WHICH ITSELF PRECEOES ANY DESCRIPTION OF ALL THINGS. EVERYTHING 
WE DESCRIBE CONSISTS OF PROCESSES WHICH HAVE FIRST ENGRAVED ITS 
TRACES IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. 
IF WE LET OUR ATTENTION ROAM ABOUT FOR A MOMENT IN THE ROOM IN 
WHICH WE ARE SITTING/I/ MAYBE WE NOW HEAR THE TICKING OF A CLOCK, 
THE PEAL OF A BELL MAY REACH OUR EARS FROM OUTSIDE, OR A CHILD 
BABBLES TO HIMSELF . . .  NOTHING OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED EARLIER. IF 
WE ARE ATTENTIVE READERS, WE WILL FORGET EVERYTHING AROUND US, 
MAYBE NOT ALWAYS WITH A SCIENTIFIC TEXT LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE SUCH 
CONCENTRATION WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT. BUT WHO DOES NOT KNOW 
THE READER OF A DETECTIVE STORY WHO, LOST IN HIMSELF, FORGETS THE 
WORLD . . .  EVEN THE THUNDER OF THE SUBWAY WHICH IT WANTED TO TAKE 
AND WHICH NOW THE STARTLED READER, JUMPING UP, HAS ALREADY 
MISSED. 
THIS SHORT JOINT REFLECTION HAS BEEN A KIND OF EXPERIMENT WITH 
US IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THREE CONCEPTS/b/ CONSCIOUSNESS, I .E .  THAT 
WHICH WE FIND DIRECTLY IN US/2/ ATTENTIVENESS AS A TERM FOR A 
FORCE WHICH IS AT FIRST INEXPLICABLE WHICH DRAWS AWAY OUR 
CON?CIOUSNESS FROM MOST OBJECTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND DIRECTS IT 
TOWARD A SINGLE PROCESS/2/ FINALLY, THINGS WHICH MEET OUR SENSE 
ORGANS (E.G. NOISES) AND, AS WE DEFINITELY KNOW, SEND MESSAGES 
FROM THEM TO OUR BRAIN, BUT DO NOT PENETRATE INTO CONSCIOUSNESS 
IN OUR BRAIN, THUS REMAIN UNCONSCIOUS. THEY ESCAPE OUR ATTENTION

BUT LEAVE ITS TRACES, FOR IF ASKED SUBSEQUENTLY ABOUT THAT WHICH 
TOOK PLACE AROUND OUR ABSORBED READER WHILE HE WAS READING THE 
DETECTIVE STORY~ IT WILL REMEMBER SOME THINGS, IF ONLY DIMLY SO. 
IN CERTAIN CASES SUCH MEMORY TRACES MAY BE ILLUMINATED EVEN 
FURTHER UNDER HYPNOSIS AND MAY BE RAISED INTO THE LIGHT nF 
CONBCIOUSNESS. 
CONSCIOUSNESS ... SEEN FROM WITHIN ... IS THUS SOMETHING TIED 
TO A STREAM OF STIMULI, WHICH RUSHES FROM OUR SENSES BY WAY OF 
OUR NERVES IN CENTRAL NERVOUS STRUCTURES, LIGHTS UP HERE AND 
THERE, TAKES POSSESSION 0F A PART OF THIS STREAM AND, DEPENDING 
ON THE PARTICULAR CIRECTION OF THE ATTENTIVENESS, PERCEIVES 
SOMETHING HERE AND THERE. /5/TO PERCEIVE/5/ HAS TO 00 WITH /5/TO 
TAKE,/5/ AND EXPRESSES AN ACTIVE INTEREST OF OUR EGO IN SELECTING 
FROM THE SUM OF POSSIBLE EXPERIENCES.
