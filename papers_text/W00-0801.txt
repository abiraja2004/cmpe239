Abstract 
With an increasing number of languages 
making their way to our desktops everyday 
via the Internet, researchers have come to 
realize the lack of linguistic knowledge 
resources for scarcely represented/studied 
languages. In an attempt to bootstrap some 
of the required linguistic resources for some 
of those languages, this paper presents an 
unsupervised method for automatic 
multilingual word sense tagging using 
parallel corpora. The method is evaluated on 
the English Brown corpus and its translation 
into three different languages: French, 
German and Spanish. A preliminary 
evaluation of the proposed method yielded 
results of up to 79% accuracy rate for the 
English data on 81.8% of the SemCor 
manually tagged ata.

1. Introduction 
With the term "globalization" becoming the 
theme of cuxrent political and economic 
discourse, communications technology - 
exemplified by the World Wide Web OVWW) - 
has become a source of an abundance of 
languages. Language researchers are faced with 
an ever so present challenge and excitement of 
being able to study and process these languages 
and create the appropriate NLP applications for 
them. Yet, a major bottleneck for many NLP 
applications uch as machine translation, cross 
language information retrieval, natural language 
understanding, etc, is word sense ambiguity. The 
problem escalates as we deal with languages that 
are scarce in processing resources and 
knowledge bases. The availability of large scale, 
accurately, sense tagged data should help 
alleviate the problem. 
It has been acknowledged that best way to 
acquire sense tags for words in a corpus is 
manually, which has proven to be a very 
expensive and labor intensive ndeavor. In an 
attempt to approximate the human effort, both 
supervised \[Bruce & Weibe, 1994; Lin, 
1999;etc.\] and unsupervised methods \[Resnik 
1997; Yarowsky, 1992&1995; etc.\] have been 
proposed to solve the problem automatically. On 
average supervised methods report higher 
accuracy rates, but they are faced with the 
problem of requiring large amounts of sense 
tagged data as training material. Most of the 
methods, to date, aim at solving the problem for 
one language, namely the language with the 
most available linguistic resources. Moreover, 
most of the proposed approaches report results 
on a handful of the data, rendering them 
solutions for a small scale of the data. 
Many researchers in the field have looked at 
language translations as a source for sense 
distinctions \[Dagan & Itai, 1994; Dyvik, 1998; 
Ide, in press; Resnik & Yarowsky, 1999; etc.\]. 
The idea is that polysemons words in one 
language can be translated as distinct words in a 
different language. The problem has always 
been the availability of large corpora in 
translation, i.e. parallel corpora. Resnik \[1999\] 
proposed a method for facilitating the 
acquisition of parallel corpora from the WWW. 
Potentially, we can have parallel corpora in a 
myriad of languages, yet the downside is the 
scarcity of  linguistic knowledge resources and 
processing tools for less widely 
represented/studied languages. Consequently, 
we decided to bootstrap the process of word 
sense tagging for both languages in a parallel 
corpus using the translations a  a source of word 
sense distinction. Thereby, attaining sense 
tagged ata for languages with scarce resources 
as well as creating a supply of large-scale, 
automatically sense tagged data for a the 
language with more knowledge resources -albeit 
noisy - to be utilized by supervised algorithms. 
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised 
method for word sense tagging of' both corpora 
automatically. The algorithm assumes the 
availability of a word sense inventory in one of 
the languages. The preliminary evaluation of 
the method on the nouns in an English corpus, 
yielded accuracy rates in the range of 69-77% 
against he polysemous nouns in a hand tagged 
test set, which contrasts with a random baseline 
of 25.6%, and a baseline of the most frequent 
sense of 67.6%. 
In the following section we describe the 
proposed method, followed by a preliminary 
evaluation of the method. Section 4 discusses 
related work and we conclude with some 
thoughts on future directions in section 5. 
2. Proposed method 
We propose amethod that utilizes translations a  
filters for sense distinctions. The method is 
unsupervised since it does not rely on the 
availability of sense tagged data. As an 
illustration, i f  we look up the canonical 
ambiguous word bank in the Oxford Hachette 
English-French dictionary, we find that it 
translates toseveral words indicating its possible 
senses. Bank, as a noun, translates to the French 
words banque, rive, bord, etc. If we reverse the 
French translations into English, we get the 
original word bank as well as other English 
equivalents. Accordingly, rive translates back 
into English as bank and shore; bord translates 
into bank, edge, and rim. Therefore, given a 
parallel corpus with a source and target 
language, if there exists a method of finding 
word afignments from the source language 
corpus to words in the target language corpus, 
one can create a set of all the words in the target 
corpus that are aligned with a word in the source 
corpus. For example, given a French/English 
parallel corpus, we would expect he word rive, 
on the French side, to align with the words bank 
and shore, on the English side, in the correct 
contexts with a high probability. This approach 
essentially hinges upon the diversity of contexts 
in which words are translated. 
We will refer to the English side of the parallel 
corpus as the target language corpus since we 
assume the knowledge resources exist for 
English. The foreign language side is referred to 
as the source corpus. 
The required linguistic knowledge resource is a 
lexical ontology that has the words in the target 
language and a listing of their associated senses. 
There are several databases of that sort available 
for language researchers, among which is 
WordNet \[Fellbanm, 1998; Miller et al, 1990\]. 
WordNet is a lexical ontology - a variant on 
semantic networks with more of a hierarchical 
structure, even though some of the nodes can 
have multiple parents - that was manually 
constructed for the English language. It 
comprises four taxonomies for four parts of 
speech: nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. 
Accordingly, given a taxonomy like WordNet 
for the target language, and an appropriate 
distance measure between words with their 
associated senses, the distance between all the 
senses for both shore and bank is calculated. In 
WordNet 1.6, bank has 10 senses, the 3 topmost 
frequent senses are: 
I. a financial institution that accepts 
deposits and channels the money into 
lending activities 
2. sloping land (especially the slope beside 
a body of  water) 
3. a supply or stock held in reserve 
especially for future use (especially in 
emergencies) 
shore has two senses listed: 
1. the land along the edge of  a body of  
water (a lake or ocean or r/vet) 
2. a beam that is propped against a 
structure to provide support 
One would expect that the distance between 
sense #2 of bank and sense #1 of shore to be 
smaller than the latter's distance from the other 
two senses of bank. Accordingly, with an 
appropriate optimization function over the 
distance measures between all the senses of the 
two words, sense #2 for bank and sense # 1 for 
shore are assigned as the correct ags for the 
words, respectively. In effect, we have assigned 
sense tags to rfi, e in its respective alignments, in
the appropriate contexts. Therefore the instances 
where rive is aligned with bank gets assigned 
sense #2 for the noun bank; instances where rive 
is aLigned with shore is assigned sense #1 for 
shore. Furthermore, we created linEq 
automatically in WordNet for the French word 
rive. Our approach is described as follows: 
? Preprocessing ofcorpora 
Tokenizc both corpora 
Align the sentences of the corpora such 
that each sentence in the source corpus 
is aligned with one corresponding 
sentence in the target corpus. 
? For each source and corresponding target 
sentence, find the best token level 
alignments. Methods for automating this 
process have been proposed in the Literature. 
\[A10naizan et al, 1999; Melamed, 2000; 
etc.\] 
? For each source language token, create aList 
of its alignments o target language tokens, 
target set 
? Using the taxonomy, calculate the distance 
between the senses of the tokens in the 
target set; assign the appropriate sense(s) to 
each of the tokens in the target set based on 
an optimiTation function over the entire set 
of target token senses 
* Propagate the assigned senses back to both 
target and source corpora tokens, 
effectively, creating two tag sets, one for 
each the target and source corpus 
? Evaluate the resnlting tag sets against ahand 
tagged test set. 
3. Preliminary Evaluation 
3.1. Materials 
We chose the Brown Corpus of American 
English \[Francis & Kutera, 1982\] - of one 
milLion words - as our target language corpus. It 
is a balanced corpus and it has more than 200K 
words that are manually sense tagged as a 
product of the semantic oncordance (SemCor) 
effort using WordNet \[Miller et al 1994\]. The 
SemCor data is tagged in lamning text - words 
of varying parts of speech are tagged in context 
- using WordNet 1.6. Hence, we used WordNet 
1.6 taxonomy as the Linguistic knowledge 
resource. \[Fellbaum, 1998\] For purposes of this 
preliminary investigation, we only explored 
nouns in the corpus, yet there are no inherent 
restrictions inthe method for applying it to other 
parts of speech. Accordingly, we used part of 
speech tags that were available in the Penn Tree 
Bank for the Brown Corpus. 
The test set was created from the polysemous 
nouns in SemCor. The nouns were extracted 
from the Brown corpus with their relative corpus 
and sentence position information. The test set 
comprised 58372 noun instances of 6824 
polysemous nouns. The nouns were not 
lemmatized. 
Two baselines were cons~ucted. A random 
baseline (RBL), where each noun instance inthe 
test set was assigned a random sense from the 
List of senses pertaining to that noun in the 
taxonomy. And a default baseline (DBL), where 
each noun instance in the test set is assigned its 
most frequent sense according to WordNet 1.6. 
The Brown Corpus only exists in English; 
therefore, we decided to automatically translate 
it into three different languages using two 
commercially available machine translation 
(MT) packages, Systran Professional 2.0 (SYS) 
and Globalink Power Translator Pro v.6.4 (GL). 
We used two different ranslation packages to 
maximize the variability of the word translation 
selection, in an attempt to approximate a human 
translation. The idea is that different MT 
packages use different bilingual exicons in the 
translation process. Moreover, we decided to use 
more than one language since polysemous words 
can be translated in different ways in different 
languages, i.e. an ambiguous word that has two 
senses could be translated into two distinct 
words into one language but into one word in 
another language. We translated the Brown 
Corpus into French, German and Spanish, since 
these are considered the most reliable languages 
for the translation quality of the MT packages. 
Furthermore, the fact that EuroWordNet exists 
for these languages faciLitates the process of 
evaluating the source language tag set. 
3.2. Experiments 
Once we had the translations available, the 
seven corpora - namely, English Brown corpus, 
French GL, German GL, Spanish GL, French 
SYS, German SYS, and Spanish SYS - were 
tokenized and the sentences were alignedk For 
1 This was a relatively easy task since the corpora re 
artificially created, therefore there was a one to one 
token level alignments, we used the GIZA 
program \[Al Onaizan et al 1999\]\[. GIZA is an 
intermediate program in a statistical machine 
translation system, EGYPT. It is an 
implementation f Models 1-4 of Brown et al 
\[1993\], where each of these models produces a
Viterbi alignment. The models are trained in 
succession where the final paraaneter values 
from one model are used as the starting 
parameters for the next model. We trained each 
model for I0 iterations. Given a source and 
target pair of  afigned sentences, GIZA produces 
the most probable token-level alignments. 
Multiple token alignments are allowed on the 
target language side, i.e. a token in English 
could align with multiple tokens :in the foreign 
language. Tokens on either side could align with 
nothing, designated as a null token. GIZA 
requires a large corpus in order to produce 
reliable alignments, hence, the use of  the entire 
Brown corpus: both the SemCor tagged data 
without the tags and the untagged data. 
Therefore, we produced the alignments for the 6 
parallel corpora - a parallel cortms comprises 
the English eorpns and its translation i to one of 
the three languages using one of  the MT 
packages - with English as the target language. 
The Brown Corpus has 52282 sentences. Due to 
processing limitations, GIZA ignores sentences 
that exceed 50 words in length, therefore it 
ignored -3000 sentences on average per parallel 
corpus alignment. GIZA output was converted to 
an internal format: sentence number followed by 
all the tokens 2 in the sentence represented as 
token positions in the target language aligned 
with corresponding source language token 
positions in the aligned foreign sentence. 
All the token positions were replaced by the 
actual tokens from the corresponding corpora. 
Tokens that were aligned with null tokens on 
either side of  the parallel corpus were ignored. 
All the tokens were tagged with the sentence 
number and sentence position. In order to reduce 
the search space, we reduced the list to the 
nouns in the corpus. We created a list of  the 
source language words that were aligned to 
nouns in the target language, thereby creating a
source-target noun list for each source word. We 
correspondence between the 
sentences. 
2 Tokens include punctuation 
source and target 
removed punctuation marks and their 
corresponding afignments; also, we filtered out 
stop words from the source language. Finally, 
we compressed the source-target list to have the 
following format: 
Src wdi trgt_nnl, trgt_nnz,...,trgt_nn, 
where Src wdi is a word J in the source 
corpus and trgt_nnj is the noun 4 it 
aligned to in the target corpus. 
Source words that were aligned with one target 
word only throughout the corpus were excluded 
from the final fist of  words to be tagged in our 
tag set. Each resulting set - a set had to include 
at least 2 nouns - of  Engfish target nouns, 
corresponding to a source word, was passed on 
to the distance measure routine. 
We used an optimization function over the 
senses of  the nouns in a set. The function aims at 
maximizing a similarity of  meaning over all the 
members of  a set based on a pair wise similarity 
calculation over all the listed senses in WordNet 
1.6. The algorithm~ disambiguate_class, which 
is implemented by Resnik and described in 
detail in \[Resnik, 1999\], calculates the similarity 
between all the words' senses of  words in a set. 
R assigns a confidence score based on shared 
information content of  the sense combinations, 
which is measured via the most informative 
subsumer in the taxonomy. The senses with the 
highest confidence scores are the senses that 
contribute the most to the maximization function 
for the set. The algorithm expects the words to 
be input as a set for calculating the confidence 
scores. In many instances, we observed 
considerable noise in the target noun set. For 
example, the French source word accord was 
aligned with the English nouns accord, 
agreement, signing, consonance, and 
encyclopaedia n the target corpus. All but the 
last word in the target set seem to be related to 
the word accord in French except 
encyclopaedia. The source of  noise can be 
attributed to the specific translation system, or to 
the alignment program~ or in other cases to the 
3 Parts of speech are not necessarily symmetric in 
alignments, i.e. nouns could very well map to verbs 
or other parts of speech. 
4 Note that the nouns at this point are types not 
tokens, i.e. not instances in the corpus rather a 
conflafion of instances 
4 
fact that the source language word itself is 
ambiguous. 
Consequently, we conducted three types of 
experiments in an attempt to reduce the noise in 
the target sets: Class sire, Pair_sinai  and 
Pair_simall .  They essentially varied in input 
format o disambiguate_class. 
For Class sire, the target noun data was 
produced irectly from the source-target list and 
input to the distance measure routine with no 
special formatting. Each of the target nouns was 
assigned the sense(s) that had the maximum 
confidence level from among the senses listed 
for it in the taxonomy. Thereby creating the tag 
set for the target language, English. If a noun 
does not have an entry in the taxonomy, it is 
assigned a null sense. 
On the other hand, for both Pair_sire 1 and 
Pair_siin all the nouns in the target fist for each 
source word were formatted into all pair 
combinations in the set and then sent to 
disambiguate_class. The idea was to localize the 
noise to the pair level comparison, since 
disambiguate_class optimizes over the entire set 
of nouns. The senses that were selected were the 
ones with the maximum confidence score from 
the noun pair sense comparison. All the senses 
with a maximum confidence score for a noun 
were aggregated into a final list of senses for 
that noun and duplicates were removed. 
In Pair_sinu1, only the senses that had a 
confidence score of 100% were considered, i.e. 
if disambiguate_class is agnostic as to whether 
the senses of the target noun pair are similar, 
each noun in this pak comparison is assigned a 
null sense, for the noun pair in the local 
comparison, respectively. That does not 
necessarily mean that either noun will have a 
final null sense in the aggregate list, it rather 
depends on the sum total of comparisons for 
each of them with all the nouns in the set. 
In Pair sire all, the same conditions apply as in 
Pair_sinai, yet there is no threshold of a 100%. 
A pair of nouns in a local comparison is 
assigned a null sense if one of the nouns in the 
pair is not in WordNet or all the senses get a 
confidence score of 0%. 
Once we had the tag set for each of our parallel 
corpora, we evaluated it against he manually 
tagged test set. So far, we only evaluated the tag 
set for the target language, English. Evaluation 
of the source tag set is in progress; a serious 
hurdle is that EuroWordNet is interfaced with 
WordNet 1.5 only. The preliminary evaluation 
metric is: 
~ co .~ta~o~joU~, lO0 \[I\] 
ace  = total hum testsenses 
We only considered the first sense assigned in 
the test set for any noun instance in the process 
of our evaluation. The system was not penalized 
if it assigned more than one sense to the noun in 
the tag set i f  the correct sense was among the 
senses assigned. 
We conducted the three types of experiments on 
the 6 parallel corpora. In the following section, 
we present the results for GL translations for the 
three languages and the SYS translation for 
Spanish, since we found no significant 
difference in the results across the two 
translation systems for the three experiment 
types. Furthermore, we wanted to test the effect 
of merging the token alignments of the two MT 
systems on the accuracy rates. For all the 
experiment conditions, the noun instances that 
were excluded from the tag set and were in the 
test set were sense tagged using the default 
baseline of 67.6%, in order to report he results 
at 100% coverage for the test set, the results of 
which are presented in table 2 below.

Table 1: Results for the different experiment 
types at various coverage levels of the test set 
Table 1. presents the results at different 
coverage percentages of the test set data for the 
English target corpus. The first cohunn has the 5 
experiment conditions used as source language 
filters of the English target corpus, and the first 
row has the three experiment types. FG is the 
French translation of the Brown corpus rendered 
by the MT system GL; GG is the German 
translation by GL; SG is the Spanish translation 
by GL; SS is the Spanish translation by the MT 
system SYS; and MSp is the merged Spanish 
translations from both NIT systems. All the 
results are presented as percentages, where the 
Coy. indicates the percentage covered by the tag 
set of the test set. Ace. is the percent correct at 
the coverage level based on the evaluation 
measure in \[ 1\]. 
Across the board, the results from Pair sire all 
for all the experiment conditions are hider than 
the results from Pai~sin~l,  which in turn are 
higher than Class sire results. The results do not 
seem to suggest any significant difference in the 
results from the two Spanish translations SG and 
SS across the three expernnent types. On the 
other hand, results from MSp outperform the 
individual Spanish translation systems for the 
Pair_sire 1 and Pair sire all experiments by a 
margin ~-25% more in coverage and -6% in 
accuracy rates. In the Class_sire xperiment, the 
individual Spanish translations outperform the 
MSp condition. We also note that coverage is 
higher for all the experiment conditions.

Table 2: Results at 100% coverage of the test

Table 2 reports the results at 100?,6 coverage of 
the test set data for the target ag set. FG, GG, 
SG, SS, MSp, are the same as in table 1. RBL is 
the random baseline, while DBL is the default 
baseline. All the experimental conditions 
significantly outperformed the random baseline. 
None of the conditions outperformed the default 
baseline, DBL, in both Class_sire and 
Pair sire 1 experiments. Pair_sinai had a 
higher accuracy rate than Class_sire for all the 
experiment conditions. Similar to the 
observations in table I, Pair sire all 
outperformed the other two experiment types for 
all the experiment conditions. Pair sire all also 
outperformed the default baseline with an 
improvement of 1.4 (marginal in this case) to 
9%. It is worth noting that there was no 
significant difference between the experimental 
conditions SG and SS across the experiment 
types. As in Table 1, the results from MSp are 
significantly higher than those obtained from the 
individual Spanish translation conditions for 
both Pair sire 1 and Pair sire all, while the 
results for Class sire were much lower than the 
individual Spanish conditions. This can be 
attributed to the fact that while combining 
evidence from both translations, we aggregated 
the noise in the target set from both translations. 
The noise causes disambiguate class to get 
trapped into assizning higher confidences to 
irrelevant senses. 
In terms of the overall performance of the 
different conditions, the results suggest that 
merging the two translation systems yields the 
best results, with an improvement of 6% over 
the individual translations independently for 
Spanish in PaL_sire_all. Examining the results 
across the three languages, it seems there were 
slight variations in the accuracy rates in the 
Pair sire 1 and Pair sire all experiments atfull 
coverage, exemplified in table 2. Yet we note 
the low relative coverage of the test data in the 
German, GG condition, as shown in table 1. This 
can be explained as a result of the nature of the 
German language, which is highly agglutinative, 
thereby affecting the quality of the alignments. 
Also it could be a reflection of the quality of the 
GL MT system for the German language. 
The most interesting result is the result of  the 
MSp condition in table 1, which indicates that 
81.8% of the target data can be sense tagged 
with an accuracy of  79%, significantly higher 
than chance (25.6%) as well as it is higher than 
the default tagging of 67.6%. We have yet to 
investigate the source tag set in order to see how 
many of these source words can transparently 
acquire the target noun senses. The fine 
graininess of WordNet leads us to suspect hat 
the appropriate l vel of  evaluation will be at the 
most informative subsumer level in the 
taxonomy (a coarser grain) as opposed to the 
actual sense tagged for the corresponding 
aligned target noun. 
The low accuracy rates over the full test set 
(table 2) may be attributed to the cascading of 
different sources of noise in the evaluation 
method, starting off with a less than perfect 
translation s and an automated alignment 
program with a reported accuracy rate of ~92% 
for word alignments, English to German. \[Och 
& Ney, 2000\] The latter result has to be 
considered with caution in the present 
experimental design context since the evaluation 
of the alignments was done with a human 
translation on a closed domain corpus, for only 
one of the languages under consideration i the 
current investigation. A large-scale multilingual 
evaluation of the alignment program is much 
needed. By qualitatively looking at some of the 
automatic ali~ments, some of the cases had 
very fight all,merits in the target language. For 
instance, the French word abr/was aligned with 
cover and shed; agitation, in French, was 
aligned with the nouns agitation, bustle, 
commotion, flurry, fuss, restlessness, and 
turmoil. 
Word ambiguity in the source language could 
have contributed to the low accuracy rates 
attained. In many cases, we noticed that the 
source language seemed to preserve the 
ambiguity found in the target language. For 
example, (a) the French word canon was aligned 
with the target nouns: cannon, cannonball, 
canon, theologian; Co) the French word bandes 
was aligned with the target nouns: band, gang, 
mob, streaks, strips, tapes, tracks. In both 
examples we see at least two clusters in the 
target noun sets, in (a), cannon and cannonball 
are one cluster and canon and theologian form 
the other cluster; in Co), the word band is 
ambiguous, we can see that band, gang and mob 
can form a cluster, while band, streaks, strips, 
tapes and tracks could form another. We are 
currently investigating the effect of 
incorporating co-occurrence information as a 
means of clustering the words in the target set, 
aiming at delineating the senses for the source 
language word. Another source of noise is the 
metaphoric as well as slang usage of some of the 
words in the target language, for instance, be'b~s, 
in French, was aligned with babes and babies in 
the target language. 
We expect the results to improve the more 
distant he language pair. Moreover, combining 
different language sources imultaneously could 
yield improved results due to the fact that 
5 We do not know of any formal evaluation on the 
quality of the two wanslation packages used 
languages will differ in the manner in which 
they conflate senses. 
We would like to explore different evaluation 
metrics for the target language, which are fine- 
tuned to the fine granularity of WordNet. As 
well as, devise methods for obtaining a 
quantitative measure of evaluation for the source 
tag set. 
4. Related Work 
There are many proposed unsupervised methods 
in the literature addressing the problem of sense 
ambiguity in language. All the reported 
unsupervised methods use monolingual 
materials, therefore comparable to the results 
obtained on the target ag set of our preliminary 
investigation. Moreover, due to differences in 
the knowledge resources and evaluation material 
it is hard to establish a direct comparison. For 
instance, Yarowsky \[1992&1995\] reports the 
highest accuracy rates, to date, for an 
unsupervised method of a mean of 92%, yet his 
evaluation was measured using a knowledge 
resource, Roget's thesaurus, which has a coarser 
granularity in its sense representation than 
WordNet. 
The most comparable results to our preliminary 
results are those reported by Resnik \[1997\] since 
he used the same corpus and evaluated against 
the same test set. He did not restrict his 
evaluation to nouns only. Resnik proposed an 
unsupervised method for sense disambiguation 
using selectional preference information, thereby 
using grammatical relations between words in a 
corpus in order to arrive at the correct sense for 
a word. He reports accuracy rates in the range of 
40.1% on average for five grammatical relations. 
Yet, Resnik explores a different dimension of 
meaning that uses a linguistically motivated 
context window which we expect will be very 
useful if combined with our approach for 
examining the verb data, for example. 
The most related work reported in the literature 
is that of Ide \[in press\]. Ide explores the question 
of whether using cross-linguistic nformation for 
sense distinction is worth pursuing. She reported 
a preliminary analysis of translation equivalents 
in four different languages of George OrweU's 
Nineteen-Eighty-four. The translations were 
human translations, i.e. natural parallel corpora. 
In her study, only 4 words were considered. 
Native speakers of the four respective languages 
7 
aligned the chosen English words to their 
foreign translations manually. The goal of her 
research was to explore the degree to which 
words are lexiealized ifferently in translated 
text. Ide classifies translation types based on 
how much they vary in what they align with in 
translation, for example, if a word aligns with a 
single word or a phrase or nothing, etc. She 
reports that in Nineteen-Eighty-Four, only 
86.6% of the English words have a single lexical 
item used in the translation. This suggests that 
with using alignment methods that target single 
word to single word alignments he upper bound 
that the approach can yield is 86.6% for this 
specific corpus. It will be interesting to conduct 
a similar study here of the Brown corpus. 
5. Conclusion and Future Directions 
We presented an unsupervised method for word 
sense tagging for both the source and the target 
languages ina parallel corpus. The :method relies 
on translations as a source of sense distinction. 
The goal of the proposed algorithm is to 
bootstrap the process of word sense tagging on a 
large scale for a language vdth linguistic 
knowledge resources as well as for languages 
with scarce resources. As a proof of concept, we 
evaluated the approach on 6 artificially created 
translation corpora. The preliminary evaluation 
yielded accuracy rates of up to 79% for 81.8% 
of the test set in the target language. The source 
language tag set is yet to be evaluated. Future 
directions include devising methods for reducing 
the noise in the target sets. Moreover, testing the 
approach on other parts of speech. Furthermore, 
it would be interesting to test the method on 
naturally created parallel corpora.
