The pr imary  cask  o f  semant ic  p rocess ing  
i s  to  prov ide  an  appropr ia te  mapp ing  between 
the  synCact lc  consC lCuanCs  o f  a parsed  
sentence and the arguments  of the semanclc  
predlcaces impl ied by the verb. This is 
known as the  Al ignment  Problem.\ [Lev ln\ ]  
Sect loo One of  thls paper gives an 
overv iew of a genera l ly  accepted approach to 
semant ic  process ing that goes through several  
levels of  representat ion  to achieve this 
mapping.  A l though somewhat  inf lex ib le  and 
cumbersome,  the d i f ferent  levels succeed in 
preserv ln  S the context  sens i t ive in format ion  
prov ided  by verb  semant ics.  Sect ion Two 
presents  the  author ' s  ru le -dr iven  approach  
which is more un i fo rm and f lex ib le yet st i l l  
accommodates  context  sens lC lve constra ints .  
This approach is based on genera l  under ly ing 
pr inc ip les  for syntact ic  methods of 
Incroduc lns  semant ic  arguments  and has 
interest ing impl icat ions  for l inguist ic  
theor ies about case. These impl icat ions  are 
d icuesed in Sect ion Three. A system that 
implements this approach has been des igned 
for and tested on pul ley prob lem statements 
gathered from several  physics text 
books . \ [Pa lmer \ ]  
1 .0  MULTI -STAGE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS  
A popu lar  approach  \ [Woods \ ] ,  \ [S immons\ ] ,  
\ [Novak \ ]  fo r  ass i sn lng  semant ic  ro les  Co 
syntact i c  coosClcueoCs can  be descr ibed  with 
three levels of representat ion  - a schema 
level, a canonical  level, and a pred icate  
level. These levels are used to br idge the 
gap between the surface syncact lc  
representat ion  and the  "deep" conceptua l  
represeoCat lon  necessary  for communicat ing  
wlth the Incernal  database.  Whi le the 
fo l lowing descr ipt ion  of these levels may not 
correspond to any one Implementac lon  in 
part icu lar ,  It wi l l  give the f lavor of the 
overal l  approach .  
I . i  Schema Leve l  The f i r s t  leve l  cor responds  
to  the  poss ib le  sur face  order  conf igurat ions  
a verb  can  appear  in .  In  a domain  o f  
equ i l ib r ium prob lems the  sentence  
"A rope  suppor ts  one  end o f  a sca f fo ld . "  
cou ld  match  a schema l i ke  "<physob J> SUPPORTS 
<locpar t> of  <physob J>" .  The word  order ing  
here  impl ies chec  the  f irst <physob J> is the  
SUBJ and the <locpart> is the OBJ. Other 
l ikely schemes for sentences  involv ing the 
SUPPORT verbs  are  "<physob J> SUPPORTS 
<physob J> AT < locpar t>,"  "<physob J> SUPPORTS 
<force>,"  "<physobJ> IS SUPPORTED,"  sod 
"<locpart> IS SUPPORTED." \ [Novak\ ]  Once a 
part icu lar  sentence has marched a schema, it 
is useful  to  rephrase the in format ion in a 
more "canonica l"  form, so Chac a s ingle of 
inference rules can apply Co a group of 
schemas. 
1.2  Canon ica l  Leve l  Th is  in termediate  leve l  
o f  representat ion  usua l ly  cons is ts  o f  the  
verb  i t se l f ,  (o r  perhaps  a more  pr imi t ive  
semant ic  p red icate  chosen  to  represent  the  
verb)  and a l i s t  o f  poss ib le  ro les ,  e .g .  
a rguments  to  the  pred icate .  These  ro les  
cor respond loose ly  to  a un ion  o f  the  var ious  
semant ic  types  ind icated  in  the  schemas .  The 
schemas  above  cou ld  a l l  eas i ly  map in to :  
SUPPORTS(<physob J> l ,<physob J>2,  
< Iocpar t>,<force>) .  
The "canon ica l "  verb  representat ion  
found at  th i s  leve l  bears  cer ta in  
s imi la r i t ies  to  a s tandard  verb  case  f rame,  
\ [S immons ,  Bruce \ ]  in  the  ro les  p layed  by the  
arguments  to  that  p red icate .  There  has  been 
some cont roversy  over  whether  o r  not  any  
benef i t s  a re  ga ined  by labe l ing  these  
arguments "cases" and aCtempt ing  to apply 
l inguist ic  genera l i t ies  about case. 
\ [F i l lmore \ ]  The poss ib le  benef i t s  do not  seem 
to  have  been rea l i zed ,  w l th  a resu l t ing  sh i f t  
away f rom exp l i c i t  t ies  to  case  in  recent  
work .  \ [Charn lak \ ] ,  \[Wilks\] 
1.3  Pred icate  Leve l  However ,  the  imp l ied  
re la t ionsh ips  between the  arguments  s t i l l  
have  to  be spe l led  out ,  and  th l s  i s  the  
funct ion of our th i rd  and final l eve l  of 
representat ion.  This level necessar i ly  makes 
use of predicates  chat can be found in the 
data  base ,  and  fo r  the  purposes  o f  the  
program is e f fec t ive ly  s "deep" semanclc 
representaClon.  A verb such  as  SUPPORT would 
require several  pred icates  in an equ i l ib r ium 
domain. For example,  the "scaffold" sentence 
above could result  in the fo l lowln S llst 
cor respond ing  Co the  general  predlcaCes 
l isted immediate ly  below. 
"Scaf fo ld"  Example  
SUPPORT(rope ,sca f fo ld )  
UP(F l , rope)  
UOWN(F2 ,sca f fo ld )  
CONTACT(rope ,sca f fo ld )  
LOCPT( r tend l , rope)  
LOCPT( r tend2,sca f fo ld )  
SAMEPLACE(rceod l , r tend2)  
Genera l  P red icates  
SUPPORT(<physob J> l ,<physob J>2)  
UP(<force>l ,<physob J>1)  
OOWN(<force>2,<physob j>2)  
CONTACT(<physob J> l ,<physob J>2)  
LOCPT(<locparc>l ,<physob J> l )  
LOCPT(<locpar t>2,<physob J>2)  
SAMEPLACE(<locpar t>t ,< locper t>2)  
125 
Produc ing  the  above  l i s t  requ i res  common 
sense  deduct ions  \ [Bundy l  about  the  ex is tence  
of objects f l l l lng arguments  chat do not 
cor respond d i rect ly  Co the  canon ica l  
arguments ,  i.e. the two <locpt>s,  and any 
arguments  that were miss ing  from the exp l ic i t  
seuteoce.  For  ins tance ,  in our  scaf fo ld  
example,  no <force> was ment ioned,  and must 
be inferred.  The use fu lness  of the canon ica l  
form is i l lus t ra ted  here,  as It prevents  
ted ious  dup l i ca t ion  of in fe rence  rules for 
s l ight ly  vary ing schemas .  
The re levant  in fo rmat ion  f rom the 
sentence has now been expressed  in a form 
compat ib le  wlth some in terna l  database.  The 
goal of th l s  semant ic  ana lys i s  has been to 
prov ide  a mapp ing  between the or ig ina l  
syntact i c  const i tuents  and the pred icate  
arguments  in the f inal  representat ion .  For 
our scaf fo ld  example  the  fo l low ing  mapping  
has been ach ieved.  The f i l l i ng  in of gaps  in 
the f inal  representat ion ,  a l though mot ivated  
by the  needs  of  the  database ,  a l so  serves  to  
res t  and expand the  mapp ing  o f  the  syntact i c  
const i tuents .  
SUBJ <- rope  <physob J> l  
OBJ <- end <pbysob J>2 
OFPP<- sca f fo ld  < locpar t>2 
An obv ious  quest ion  a t  th i s  po in t  i s  
whether  or  not  the  mapp ings  f rom syntact i c  
const i tuents  to pred icate  arguments  can be 
ach ieved  d i rect ly ,  s ince the above 
mul t i - s tage  approach  has  a t  leas t  th ree  major  
d i sadvantages :  
1) I t  is ted ious  fo r  the  programmer  co 
produce  the  or ig ina l  schemas,  and the  
resu l t ing  amount  of  spec ia l  purpose  code  i s  
cumbersome.  I t  is d i f f i cu l t  . for the 
programmer  to  guarantee  that  al l  schemas  have  
been  accounted  fo r .  
2) Th is  type  o f  sys tem i s  not  very  
robust .  A schema that  has  been  le f t  out  
s imp ly  cannot  be matched no mat ter  how much 
i t  has  in  common wi th  s to red  schemas .  
3) Because  of  the  in f lex ib i l i ty  of  the  
sys tem I t  i s  f requent ly  des i rab le  co add  new 
I n fo rmac lon .  Add ing Just  one schema, much 
less an ent i re verb ,  can be clme consuming.  
How much of a h indrance  thls wi l l  be is 
dependent  on the extent  Co which the semant ic  
in fo rmat ion  has been embedded in the code. 
The LUNAR pro jec t ' s  use of a mean lns  
representat ion  language great ly  inc reased  the  
ef f i c iency  of add ing new in format ion .  
The fo l low ing  sect ion  presents  a sys tem 
thaC uses  syntact i c  cues  a t  the  semant ic  
p red icate  leve l  to  f ind  mapp ings  d i rec t ly .  
Th is  method  has  Inceresc lng  imp l i ca t ions  fo r  
theor ies  about  cases.  
2.0 RULE-DRIVEN SEMANTIC ANALYSIS  
Th is  sect ion  presents  a sys tem for  
semant ic  p rocess in  S that  maps syntact i c  
const i tuents  d i rec t ly  onto  the  arguments  of  
the  semant ic  p red icates  suggested  by the  
verb .  In  o rder  Co make these  ass ignments ,  
the  poss ib le  syntact i c  mapp ings  must  be 
assoc ia ted  w i th  each  argument  p lace  in  the  
or ig ina l  semant ic  p red icates .  For  ins tance ,  
the  on ly  poss ib le  syntact i c  const i tuent  that  
can  be ass igned  to  the  <physob J>1 p lace  o f  a 
SUPPORT pred icate  i s  the  SUBJ, and a 
<physob J>2 can  on ly  be f i l l ed  by an OBJ.  But 
a < locpar t> might  be an OBJ o r  the  ob jec t  of  
an AT prepos i t ion ,  as  in  "The sca f fo ld  iS  
suppor ted  a t  one end . "  (The sca f fo ld  in  th i s  
example  i s  the  syntact i c  sub ject  of  a pass ive  
sentence ,  so iC i s  a l so  cons idered  the  
l og ica l  ob jec t .  For  our  purposes  we wi l l  
l ook  on i t  as an OBJ).  I t  m ight  seem at  
f i r s t  g lance  chat  we wou ld  want  to  a l low our  
<physob J>2 to  be the  ob jec t  o f  ao OF 
prepos i t ion ,  as  in  "The rope  suppor ts  one end 
of  the  sca f fo ld . "  But that  i s  on ly  t rue  i f  
the  OFPP fo l lows  someth ing  l l ke  a < locpar t> 
which  can  be an OgJ in  a sentence  about  
SUPPORT. (Of course ,  Jus t  any  OPPP w i l l  not  
supp ly  a <physob J>2.  In  "The rope  suppor ts  
the  end of  g reates t  we ight . " ,  the  ob jec t  of  
the  OPPP I s  not  a <physob J> so cou ld  not  
sa t i s fy  <physob J>2.  The <physob J>2 in  th l s  
case  must  be prov ided  by the  prev ious  
context . )  
I t  i s  th i s  very  dependency  on the  
ex is tence  o f  o ther  spmc i f i c  types  o f  
syntact i c  const i tuents  chat  was captured  by 
the  schemas  ment ioned  above .  I t  i s  necessary  
fo r  an a l te rnat ive  sys tem to  a l so  hand le  
context  sens i t i ve  const ra in ts .  
2.1  Dec is ion  Trees  The three  leve ls  o f  
representat ion  ment ioned in  Sect ion  One can 
be v iewed as the  bot tom,  midd le  and top  of  a 
tree.

"The rope  suppor ts  one  and of  the  sca f fo ld . "  
126 
The in ference  ru les  that  l ink  the  three  
leve ls  dea l  ma in ly  w i th  any  necessary  
renaming  o f  the  ro le  an argument  p lays .  The  
SUBJ of the schema level is renamed 
<physobJ>1 or pl at the canonica l  level, and 
is st i l l  pl at the pred icate  level. 
One way of v iewing the schemas is as 
l ea f  nodes  produced by a dec is ion  t ree  that  
starts at the pred icate  level. The levels of 
the tree cor respond to the d i f ferent  
syntact ic  const i tuents  that can map onto the 
arguments  of the or ig ina l  set of predicates .  
Since more than one argument can be renamed 
as a part icu lar  syntact ic  const i tuent ,  there  
can be more than one branch at each level. 
If a semant ic  argument might not be ment ioned 
exp l ic i t ly  in the syntact ic  conf igurat ion,  
this also has to  be  expressed as a rule, ex. 
pl -> NULL. (Ex. "The scaf fo ld  is 
supported." )  When all of the branches have 
been taken, each terminal  node represents  the 
set of dec is ions cor respond ing  to  a 
par t icu lar  schema. (See Append ix  A.) Note  
that the canonica l  level never has co be 
expressed expl ic i t ly .  By work ing top down 
instead of bot tom up unnecessary  dup l icat ion  
of inference rules iS automat ica l ly  avoided. 
The in format ion  in the or ig ina l  three 
levels can be stored equ iva lent ly  as the top 
node of the dec is ion tree along with the 
renaming rules for the semant ic  arguments  
(rewrite rules).  This would reverse  the  
order of analys is  from the bottom-up mode 
suggested in sect ion one to a cop-down mode. 
This uses a more compact representat ion,  but  
would be computat iona l ly  less ef f ic ient .  
Growing the ent ire dec is ion tree every time a 
sentence needed to be matched would be quite 
cumbersome.  However,  if only the path to the 
correct terminal  node needed to be generated,  
this approach would be computat lona l ly  
compet i t ive.  By order ing the dec is ions 
accord ing to  syntact ic  precedence,  and by 
using the data from the sentence in quest ion 
to prune the tree WHILE it is being 
generated,  the correct  dec is ions can usual l ly  
be made, with the only path explored being 
the  path to  the  cor rec t  schema. 
2.2 Context  Sens i t ive Constra ints  Context  
sens l t iv i ty  can be preserved by only a l lowing 
the p2->OPPP rule to apply after a mappin S 
for Iptl has been found, ev idence that an 
Ipt l ->OBJ  rule could have already appl ied.  
To tes t  whether  such a mapping has been made 
given a LOCPT predicate,  it is only necessary  
tO see if the iptl argument has been renamed 
by a syntact ic  const i tuent .  The renaming 
process can be thought of as an ins tant la t lon  
of typed var iab les ,  - the semant ic  arguments  
by syntact ic  const i tuents .  \[Palmer, 
Gal l ler ,  and Welner\] Then the fo l lowing 
precond i t ions  must be sat is f ied before 
apply ing the p2->OFPP rule: ( /\ stands for 
AND) 
p2->OFPP/  LOCPT( Ipt l ,p2)  
/\ not (var lab le ( ip t l ) )  
These precond i t ions  wi l l  st i l l  need to 
be sat is f ied when a LOCPT predicate is part 
of another verb representat ion.  Anyt ime a 
<locpart> is ment ioned It can be fo l lowed by 
an OFPP in t roduc ing  the  <physob J> of which  I t  
i s  a locat ion  par t .  Th is  re la t ionsh ip  
between a < locparc> and a <physob J> i s  Jus t  
as  va l id  when the  verb  i s  "hang"  o r  
"connect . "  Ex .  "The  pu l ley  i s  connected  to  
the  r ight  end  o f  the  s t r ing . "  " The par t i c le  
is hung from the r ight  end of the str ing."  
These par t icu lar  const ra ints  are general  to 
the domain rather than being restr icted to 
"support ' .  This i l lustetes  the e f f lc lency of 
assoc ia t ing  const ra ints  with semant ic  
predicates  rather than verbs,  a l lowing for 
more advantage to be taken of genera l i t ies .  
There is an obvious resemblance here to 
the  notat ion used for Local Constra ints  
grammars \[Joshi and Levy\]:  
p2->OFPP/  DOM(LOCPT)  /\ 
LMS( Ipt l )  /\ not (var( ipt l ) )  
DOM - DOMinate,  
LMS - Left Most S ister  
I t  can  be  demonst ra ted  that  the  context  
sens i t ive  const ra in ts  p resented  here  are  a 
simple specia l  case of their Local  
Constra ints ,  s ince the dominat ing  node is 
l imited to being the immediate predicate 
head.  Whether  o r  not  such  a res t r i c ted  loca l  
context  will  prove  suf f ic ient  fo r  more  
complex domains remains to  be  proven. 
2.3 Overv iew As i l lus t ra ted  above, our 
mappings from syntact i c  const i tuents  to  
semant ic  a rguments  can  be  found d i rec t ly ,  
thus gain ing f lex ib i l i ty  and un i formity  
without  losing context  sens i t iv i ty .  Once the  
verb has been recognized,  the semant ic  
pred icates  represent ing the verb can dr ive 
the se lect ion of renaming rules direct ly,  
avo id ing the necess i ty  of an intermediate  
level of representat ion .  The contextual  
dependenc ies  or ig ina l ly  captured by the 
schemes are preserved in precondi t ions  that 
are assoc iated with the app l icat ion  of the 
renaming rules. Since the renaming rules and 
the precond i t ions  refer only to semant ic  
predicates  and arguments  to the predicates,  
there is a sense in which they are 
i ndependent  of ind iv idua l  verbs .  By app ly ing  
only those rules that are relevant to the 
sentence in quest ion,  the correct mappings 
can be found quickly and ef f ic ient ly .  The 
resul t ing system is h ighly f lexible,  since 
the  same pred icates  a re  used  in  the  
representat ion  o f  a l l  the  verbs ,  and  many o f  
the  precond i t ions  a re  genera l  to  the  domain .  
This fac i l l i tates  the addi t ion of s imi lar  
verbs since most of the  necessary  semant ic  
pred icates  with the appropr ia te  renaming 
rules wil l  a l ready be present.

3.0 THE ROLE OF CASE INFORMATION 
A l though the canon ica l  level has often 
been v iewed as the case frame level, doing 
away with the canon ica l  level does not 
necessar i l y  imply chat cases are no longer  
re levant  to semant ic  p rocess ing .  On the 
cont rary ,  the  impor tance  here of syntacc lc  
cues for in t roduc ing  semant ic  a rguments  
p laces even more emphas is  on the t rad i t iona l  
noc lon of case. The suggest ion  is chat the 
appropr ia te  level for case in format ion  is in 
fact the pred icate  level,  and that most 
c rad lC lona l  cases should be seen as arguments  
to  c lear ly  def ined semant ic  p red icates .  
These  pred icates  a re  no~ mere ly  the  
s imp le  set  of  f l a t  p red icates  ind icated  in  
the  prev ious  sect ions .  There  i s  an imp l i c i t  
s t ruc tur ihg  to  chat  se t  of pred icates  
ind icated  by the  imp l i ca t ions  ho ld ing  between 
them.  A SUPPORT re la t ionsh ip  impl ies  the  
ex is tence  of UP and DOWN forces and a CONTACT 
re la t ionsh ip .  A CONTACT re la t ionsh ip  impl ies  
the  ex is tence of LOCPT's  and a SAMEPLACE 
re la t ionsh ip  between them.  The set of 
pred icates  descr ib ing  "suppor t "  can  be 
produced  by expand ing  the  imp l i ca t ions  o f  the  
SUPPORT(p l ,p2)  p red icate  in to  UP( f l ,p l )  and 
DOWN(f2 ,p2)  and CONTACT(p l ,p2) .  
CONTACT(p l ,p2)  is in turn expanded into 
LOCPT( Ip t l ,p l )  and LOCPT( ip t2 ,p2)  and 
SAMEPLACE( Ip I , Ip t2 ) .  These def ln ic lons ,  or 
expans ions ,  are represented  as the fo l lowing  
rewr i te  rules: 
supporc<->SUPPORT(p l ,p2)  
SUPPORT(p l ,p2)<-> 
UP( f I ,p I ) / \DOWN(f2 ,p2)  
/ \CONTACT(p l ,p2)  
CONTACT(p l ,p2)<-> 
LOCPT( IpC I ,p I ) / \ LOCPT( Ip t2 ,p2)  
/ \SAMEPLACE(p l ,p2)  
When "suppor t "  has  been  recogn ized  as  
the  verb ,  these  ru les  can  be app l ied ,  to  
bui ld  up the set of semant ic  p red icates  
needed to  represent  suppor t .  I f  there  were  
expans ions  for UP and DOWN they could be 
app l ied  as wel l .  As the rules are be ing 
app l ied  the mapp ings  of  syntact ic  
const i tuents  to pred icate  arguments  can be 
made at the same time, as each argument  is 
in t roduced.  The case in format ion  is not 
mere ly  the set of semant ic  p red icates  or Just 
the SUPPORT(p I ,p2)  p red icate  alone.  Rather ,  
the  case in format ion  is represented  by the  
set  of pred icates ,  the  dependenc ies  ind icated  
by the  expans ions  fo r  the  pred icates ,  and the  
renaming rules that arm needed to f led the 
appropr ia te  mapp ings .  The renaming  ru les  
cor respond to  the  t rad i t iona l  syntact i c  cues  
fo r  in t roduc ing  par t i cu la r  cases .  They are  
fur ther  res t r i c ted  by be ing  assoc ia ted  wlth 
the  pred icate  context  of an argument  ra ther  
than the argument  i n  I so laC lon .  
When this s t ructured  case in format ion  i s  
used to dr ive semant ic  p rocess ing ,  It is not 
a pass ive  frame that wai ts  for its s lots to 
be f i l l ed ,  but  ra ther  an ac t ive  s t ruc ture  
that goes in search of f i l lers  for i t s -  
arguments .  If these Ins tant ia t lons  are sot  
i nd icated  exp l i c i t l y  by syntax,  they must be 
in ferred from a wor ld  model.  The fo l lowing 
example i l lus t ra tes  how the acClve case 
s t ruc ture  can  a l so  supp ly  cases  not  ment ioned  
exp l i c i t l y  in  the  sentence .  
3 .1  Example  G iven  a pa i r  o f  sentences  l i ke  
"Two men are  l i f t ing  a dresser .  A rope  
suppor ts  the  end of  g reates t  weight . "  
we wi l l  assume that  the  f i r s t  sentence  
has  a l ready  been  processed .  Hav ing  
recogn ized  that  the  verb  of the  second 
sentence  i s  "suppor t ' ,  the  appropr ia te  
expans ion  can  be app l ied  co produce :  
SUPPORT( rope ,p2)  
Th is  wou ld  in  tu rn  be expanded to :  
UP( f l , rope)  
DOWN(f2,p2)  
CONTACT( rope ,p2)

3.2 Assoc iat ions  wlt____~h l lnsulst lcs  A recent 
trend in l ingu is t ics  co cons ider  cases as 
&rguments  to thematic  re lat ions offers a 
surpr is ing  amount of support  for this 
pos i t ion.  Without denying the ext remely  
usefu l  tles between syntact ic  const l tuencs  
sod semant ic  cases, Jackendof f  quest ions the 
abi l lcy  of case to  capture complex semant ic  
re lat ionsh ips .  \ [ Jackendoff\]  His main 
ob ject ion  is that s tandard case theory does 
not a l low a noun phrase to be ass igned more 
than one case. In examples l lke "Esau traded 
h ls  b i r th r ight  ( to  Jacob)  fo r  a mess  o f  
pottage,"  Jackendof f  sees two related 
act ions:  "The f irst is the change of hands 
of the b i r thr ight  from Esau to Jacob. The 
direct object is Theme, the sub~ect  is 
Source, and the to -ob jec t  is Goal. Also 
there is what I wi l l  cal l  the secondary  
act ion, the changlnS of hands of the mess of 
pot tage  in  the  ocher  d i rec t ion .  In  th i s  
ac t ion ,  the  fo r -phrase  i s  Secondary  Theme,  
the  sub ject  is Secondary  Goal, and the  
to-phrase is Secondary Source."  \[p.35\] This, 
of course, could not be captured by a 
F i l lmore- l lke  case frame. Jackendof f  
concludes that, "A theory of case grammar in 
which each noun phrase has exact ly  one 
semant ic  funct ion in deep st ructure  cannot 
provide deep st ructures  which sat is fy  the 
stron S Katz -Posta l  Hypothes is ,  that is, which 
provide all semant ic  in format ion  about the 
sentence."  Jackendoff  i s  sot complete ly  
d lscard ln  E case in format ion,  but rather 
suggest ing a new level of semant ic  
representat ion  that tr ies to incorporate  some 
of the advantages of case. Mak ing 
const ruct ive  use of Gruber 's  system of 
thematic re lat ionsh ips  \[Gruher\],  Jackendof f  
postu lates  "The thematic re lat ions can now be 
def ined in terms of \[these\] semant ic  
subfunct lons.  Agent is the argument of CAUSE 
chat is an indiv idual ;  Theme Is the argument 
of CHANGE that is an indiv idual ;  Source and 
Goal are the in i t ia l  and f inal state 
arguments  of CHANGE. Locat ion wi l l  be 
def ined in terms of a further semanclc  
funct ion BE thac  takes an ind iv idual  (the 
Theme) and a state (the Locat lon) .  \[p.39\] 
I ndeed,  Jackendof f  i s  one  example  o f  a 
t rend  noted  by  Janet  Fodor  She  po in ts  out  
chat  " i t  may be  more  revea l ing  to  regard  the  
noun phrases which are assoc iated in a 
var iety  of case re lat ions with the LEXICAL 
verb as the arguments  of the pr imi t ive  
SEMANTIC pred icates  into which It i s  
analyzed.  These semant ic  predicates  
typ ica l ly  have very few arguments,  perhaps 
three at the most, but there are a lot of 
them and hence there wi l l  be a lot of 
d i s t ingu ishab le  "case caCesor les . ' (Those  
which F i l lmore has ident i f ied  appear to be 
those assoc iated wlth semant ic  components  
that  a re  part icu lar ly  f requent  o r  p rominent ,  
such as CAUSE, USE, BECOME, AT.)"  \[p.93\] 
Fodor summarizes with, "As a cont r ibut ion  CO 
semant ics ,  therefore,  it seems best to regard 
F i l lmore's  analyses as mere ly  scepplng stones 
on the way Co a more  complete spec i f i ca t ion  
of the meanings of verbs ."  The one loose end 
in thls neat summat ion  of case is its 
re lat ion to  syntax. Fodor conclnues,  
"Whether  there are any SYNTACTIC propert ies  
of case categor ies  that F i l lmore 's  theory 
pred ic ts  but  wh ich  are  missed  by  the  semant ic  
approach  i s  another  quest ion . . . . "  
I t  I s  the  thes is  o f  th l s  paper  that  
these  synCact lc  p roper t ies  o f  case  categor ies  
a re  the  very  cues  that  a re  used  to  dr ive  the  
f i l l ing of semant ic  arguments  by syntact ic  
const i tuents .  Thls system also al lows the 
same syntact ic  const i tuent  to fl l l  more than 
one argument,  e.g. case category .  The 
fo l lowing sect ion presents  further  ev idence 
chat  thls system could have direct  
impl icat ions  for l ingu is t ic  theor ies about 
case. A l though it may at f irst seem that  the 
ana lys i s  o f  the  INSTRUMENT case  cont rad ic ts  
cer ta in  assumpt ions  that  have  been made,  i t  
actua l ly  serves  to  preserve  a useful  
d isc t inc t ion  between marked  end  unmarked 
INSTRUMENTS.  
3.3 The INSTRUMENT Case 
The cases necessary  for "suppor t "  were 
all accomodated as arguments  to semant ic  
pr imit ives .  Thls does  not  imp ly ,  however,  
that  cases  can  never  p lay  a more  impor tant  
ro le  In  the  semant ic  representat ion .  I t  i s  
poss ib le  fo r  a case  to  have  I t s  own expans ion  
which contains in format ion  about how semant ic  
pred icates  shou ld  be  s t ructured .  There  i s  
qu i te  conv inc ing  ev idence  in  the  pu l ley  
domain for the in f luent ia l  ef fect  of one 
par t icu lar  case, 
In thls domaln INSTRUMENTS are 
essent ia l l y  " in termediar ies"  in "hang" and 
"connect" re lat ionsh ips .  An <inter>medlary  
is a f lex ib le l lne segment that ef fects a 
LOCATION or CONTACT re la t ionsh ip  respect ive ly  
between two phys ica l  objects.  Example 
sentences are "A par t ic le  is hung by a str ing 
from a pul ley,"  and "A par t ic le  is connected 
to  another  par t i c le  by  a s t r ing . "  The  
fo l lowing rewri te rules ere the expans ions 
fo r  the  "hang"  and  "connect  ? verbs ,  where  the  
EFFECT pred icate  wl l l  have Its own expans ion 
cor responding to the def in i t ion  of an 
i n termed iary .  
han S <-> EFFECT( ln ter ,LOCATION(p I , Ioc ) )  
connect <-> EFFECT( In ter ,CONTACT(p I ,F2) )  
App l i cat ion  of these rules repect lve ly  
results in the fo l lowing representat ion  for 
the example sentences:  
EFFECT(s t r ing ,LOCATION(per t i c le l ,pu l ley l ) )  
EFFECT(s t r lng ,CONTACT(par r l c le l ,ps r t l c le2) )  
129 
The expans ion of EFFECT itself  is: 
EFFECT( inter ,  REL(arg l ,a rg2) )  <-> 
REL(arg l , in ter ) ,  
REL( in ter ,a rg2) )  
where REL stands for any semant ic  
predicate.  The app l i ca t ion  of this expans ion 
to the above representat ions  results in: 
LOCATION(par t i c le l , s t r ing)  
LOCATION(s t r lng ,pu l lay l )  
and 
CONTACT(par t i c le l , s t r ins )  
CONTACT(sCr lng ,par t l c la2)  
These  pred icates  can  then  be  expanded,  
w i th  LOCATION br ing ing  in  SUPPORT and 
CONTACT, and  CONTACT br ing ing  in  LOCPT.  
3 .4  Poss ib le  Imp l i ca t ions  There  seams to  be  a 
d i rec t  connect ion  between the  prev ious  
expans ion  of in termediary  and the analys is  of 
the INSTRUMENT case done by  Beth Levln at  
MIT. \ [Lev ln \ ]  She po inted  out a d is t inct  
d i f fe rence  in the  use of the  same INSTRUMENT 
in the  fo l lowing two sentences:  
" John cut his foot with a rock." 
"John cut his foot on a rock." 
In the first sentence there is an 
impl i cat ion  that John was in some way 
"contro l l ing"  the cutt ing of his foot ,  and 
us ing  the  rock  to  do  so .  In  the  second 
sentence there is no such  impl icat ion,  and 
John  probab ly  cut  h i s  foot  acc identa l ly .  The  
use  o f  the  "w i th"  prepos i t ion  marks  the  rock  
as  an  INSTRUMENT. that  i s  be ing  man ipu la ted  
by  John ,  whereas  "on"  in t roduces  an  unmarked 
INSTRUMENT with no impl ied  ra la t ionsh ion  to  
John. It would seem that someth ing llke the 
expans ion for EFFECT could he lp  to capture 
par t  of what is being impl ied by the 
"control"  re la t ionsh ip .  Br ing ing  in the 
t rans i t iv i ty  re la t ionsh ip  makes expl ic i t  a 
connect ion  between John and the rock as well  
as between the foot and the rock. ~n the 
second sentence on ly  the connect ion  between 
the foot and the rock is impl ied.  The 
connect ion  impl ied here is cer ta in ly  more 
compl icated  than a s imple  CONTACT 
re lat ionsh ip ,  and would neccsss i ta te  a more 
deta i led unders tand ing  of "cut." But  the 
suggest ion  of "control"  is at  least ind icated 
by the embedd ing  of the  CUT pred icate  wi th in  
EFFECT and CAUSE. 
CAUSE( John ,EFFECT( rock , (CUT( foot -o f - John) ) )  
The tie between the AGENT and the 
INSTRUMENT is another  imp l i cat ion  of 
"cont ro l "  that  shou ld  be  exp lored .  
That the d i s t inc t ion  between marked and 
unmarked INSTRUMENTS can be captured by the 
EFFECT re lat ionsh ip  is i l lust rated by the 
process ing  of the fo l lowing two sentences:  
"The part ic le  is hung from a pul ley by a 
str ing."  
"The par t ic le  is hung on a str ing."  
In the first sentence an "inter" (a 
marked INSTRUMENT) is suppl ied by the BYPP, 
and the fo l lowing representat ion  is produced: 
EFFECT(s t r ing ,LOCATION(par t l c le ,pu l ley ) )  
In the second sentence no "inter" is 
found, and in the absence of an "inter" the 
EFFECT re la t ionsh ip  cannot  be expanded. The 
LOCATION(par t i c le , s t r lng)  pred icate  is left 
to stand alone and is in turn expanded.  (The 
ONPP can indicate a "lot. ?) 
The int r igu ing poss ib i l i ty  of verb 
independent  def in i t ions  for cases requires 
much more exp lorat ion .  \[Charniak\] The 
suggest ion  here is that a deeper level of 
representat ion ,  the  pred icate  leve l ,  is 
appropr ia te  fo r  invest igat ing  case  
impl icat ions ,  and that impor tant  cases llke 
AGENTS and INSTRUMENTS have impl icat ions  fo r  
mats - leve l  s t ructur ing  of those pred icates .  
3.5 Summary In summary,  there is a surpr is ing  
amount of in fo rmat ion  a t  the semant ic  
pred icate  level that a l lows syntact ic  
const i tuents  to  be  mapped d i rec t ly  onto  
semant ic  a rguments .  Th is  resu l ts  in  a 
semant ic  p rocesser  that  has  the  advantage  o f  
be ing  easy  to  bu i ld  and  more  f lex ib le  than  
ex is t ing  processers .  I t  a l so  br ings  to  l ight  
substant ia l  ev idence  that  cases  shou ld  not  be  
d iscarded but  shou ld  be  reexamined w i th  
respect  to  the  ro les  they  p lay  as  a rguments  
to  semant ic  p red icates .  The  INTERMEDIAKY 
case  is seen to  p lay  a par t i cu la r ly  impor tant  
ro le  hav ing  to  do  not  w i th  any  par t i cu la r  
semant ic  p red icate ,  but  w i th  the  cho ice  o f  
semant ic  p red icates  in  genera l .
