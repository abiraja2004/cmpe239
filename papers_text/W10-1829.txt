Abstract
We propose in this paper a broad-coverage
approach for multimodal annotation of
conversational data. Large annotation pro-
jects addressing the question of multimo-
dal annotation bring together many dif-
ferent kinds of information from different
domains, with different levels of granula-
rity. We present in this paper the first re-
sults of the OTIM project aiming at deve-
loping conventions and tools for multimo-
dal annotation.
1 Introduction
We present in this paper the first results of the
OTIM1 project aiming at developing conventions
and tools for multimodal annotation. We show
here how such an approach can be applied in the
annotation of a large conversational speech cor-
pus.
Before entering into more details, let us men-
tion that our data, tools and conventions are des-
cribed and freely downlodable from our website
(http ://www.lpl-aix.fr/ otim/).
The annotation process relies on several tools
and conventions, most of them elaborated within
the framework of the project. In particular, we pro-
pose a generic transcription convention, called En-
riched Orthographic Trancription, making it pos-
sible to annotate all specific pronunciation and
speech event, facilitating signal alignment. Dif-
ferent tools have been used in order to prepare
or directly annotate the transcription : grapheme-
phoneme converter, signal alignment, syllabifica-
tion, prosodic analysis, morpho-syntactic analysis,
chunking, etc. Our ambition is to propose a large
corpus, providing rich annotations in all the dif-
1OTIM stands for Outils pour le Traitement de l?Informa-
tion Multimodale (Tools for Multimodal Annotation). This
project in funded by the French ANR agency.
ferent linguistic domains, from prosody to gesture.
We describe in the following our first results.
2 Annotations
We present in this section some of the annota-
tions of a large conversational corpus, called CID
(Corpus of Interactional Data, see (Bertrand08)),
consisting in 8 dialogues, with audio and video si-
gnal, each lasting 1 hour.
Transcription : The transcription process is
done following specific conventions derived from
that of the GARS (Blanche-Benveniste87). The
result is what we call an enriched orthographic
construction, from which two derived transcrip-
tions are generated automatically : the standard or-
thographic transcription (the list of orthographic
tokens) and a specific transcription from which
the phonetic tokens are obtained to be used by the
grapheme-phoneme converter.
From the phoneme sequence and the audio si-
gnal, the aligner outputs for each phoneme its
time localization. This aligner (Brun04) is HMM-
based, it uses a set of 10 macro-classes of vowel
(7 oral and 3 nasal), 2 semi-vowels and 15 conso-
nants. Finally, from the time aligned phoneme se-
quence plus the EOT, the orthographic tokens is
time-aligned.
Syllables : The corpus was automatically seg-
mented in syllables. Sub-syllabic constituents (on-
set, nucleus and coda) are then identified as well
as the syllable structure (V, CV, CCV, etc.). Sylla-
bic position is specified in the case of polysyllabic
words.
Prosodic phrasing : Prosodic phrasing refers
to the structuring of speech material in terms of
boundaries and groupings. Our annotation scheme
supposes the distinction between two levels of
phrasing : the level of accentual phrases (AP, (Jun,
2002)) and the higher level of intonational phrases
186
(IP). Mean annotation time for IPs and APs was
30 minutes per minute.
Prominence : The prominence status of a syl-
lable distinguishes between accentuability (the
possibility for syllable to be prominent) and pro-
minence (at the perception level). In French the
first and last full syllables (not containing a
schwa) of a polysyllabic word can be prominent,
though this actual realization depends on spea-
kers choices. Accentuability annotation is auto-
matic while prominence annotation is manual and
perceptually based.
Tonal layer : Given a lack of consensus on the
inventory of tonal accents in French, we choose to
integrate in our annotation scheme three types of
tonal events : a/ underlying tones (for an eventual
FrenchToBI annotation) ; b/ surface tones (anno-
tated in terms of MOMel-Intsint protocol Hirst et
al 2000) ; c/ melodic contours (perceptually anno-
tated pitch movements in terms of their form and
function). The interest to have both manual and
automatic INTSINT annotations is that it allows
the study of their links.
Hand gestures : The formal model we use for
the annotation of hand gestures is adapted from
the specification files created by Kipp (2004) and
from the MUMIN coding scheme (Allwood et al,
2005). Among the main gesture types, we anno-
tate iconics, metaphoric, deictics, beats, emblems,
butterworths or adaptors.
We used the Anvil tool (Kipp, 2004) for the ma-
nual annotations. We created a specification files
taking into account the different information types
and the addition of new values adapted to the
CID corpus description (e.g. we added a separate
track Symmetry). For each hand, the scheme has 10
tracks. We allowed the possibility of a gesture per-
taining to several semiotic types using a boolean
notation. A gesture phrase (i.e. the whole gesture)
can be decomposed into several gesture phases i.e.
the different parts of a gesture such as the prepara-
tion, the stroke (the climax of the gesture), the hold
and the retraction (when the hands return to their
rest position) (McNeill, 1992). The scheme also
enables to annotate gesture lemmas (Kipp, 2004),
the shape and orientation of the hand during the
stroke, the gesture space, and contact. We added
the three tracks to code the hand trajectory, ges-
ture velocity and gesture amplitude.
Discourse and Interaction : Our discourse an-
notation scheme relies on multidimensional fra-
meworks such as DIT++ (Bunt, 2009) and is com-
patible with the guidelines defined by the Semantic
Annotation Framework (Dialogue Act) working
group of ISO TC37/4.
Discourse units include information about their
producer, have a form (clause, fragment, dis-
fluency, non-verbal), a content and a communi-
cative function. The same span of raw data may
be covered by several discourse units playing dif-
ferent communicative functions. Two discourse
units may even have exactly the same temporal ex-
tension, due to the multifonctionality that cannot
be avoided (Bunt, 2009).
Compared to standard dialogue act annotation
frameworks, three main additions are proposed :
rhetorical function, reported speech and humor.
Our rhetorical layer is an adaptation of an exis-
ting schema developed for monologic written data
in the context of the ANNODIS project.
Disfluencies : Disfluencies are organized
around an interruption point, which can occur al-
most anywhere in the production. Disfluencies can
be prosodic (lenghtenings, silent and filled pauses,
etc.), or lexicalized. In this case, they appear as a
word or a phrase truncation, that can be comple-
ted. We distinguish three parts in a disfluency (see
(Shriberg, 1994), (Blanche-Benveniste87)) :
? Reparandum : what precedes the interruption
point. This part is mandatory in all disfluen-
cies. We indicate there the nature of the inter-
rupted unit (word or phrase), and the type of
the truncated word (lexical or grammatical) ;
? Break interval. It is optional, some disfluen-
cies do not bear any specific event there.
? Reparans : the part following the break, repai-
ring the reparandum. We indicate there type
of the repair (no restart, word restart, determi-
ner restart, phrase restart, etc.), and its func-
tion (continuation, repair without change, re-
pair with change, etc.).
3 Quantitative information
We give in this section some indication about
the state of development of the CID annotation.
Hand gestures : 75 minutes involving 6 spea-
kers have been annotated, yielding a total number
of 1477 gestures. The onset and offset of gestures
correspond to the video frames, starting from and
187
going back to a rest position.
Face and gaze : At the present time, head move-
ments, gaze directions and facial expressions have
been coded in 15 minutes of speech yielding a to-
tal number of 1144 movements, directions and ex-
pressions, to the exclusion of gesture phases. The
onset and offset of each tag are determined in the
way as for hand gestures.
Body Posture : Our annotation scheme consi-
ders, on top of chest movements at trunk level,
attributes relevant to sitting positions (due to the
specificity of our corpus). It is based on the Pos-
ture Scoring System (Bull, 1987) and the Annota-
tion Scheme for Conversational Gestures (Kipp et
al., 2007). Our scheme covers four body parts :
arms, shoulders, trunk and legs. Seven dimensions
at arm level and six dimensions at leg level, as well
as their related reference points we take in fixing
the spatial location, are encoded.
Moreover, we added two dimensions to describe
respectively the arm posture in the sagittal plane
and the palm orientation of the forearm and the
hand. Finally, we added three dimensions for leg
posture : height, orientation and the way in which
the legs are crossed in sitting position.
We annotated postures on 15 minutes of the cor-
pus involving one pair of speakers, leading to 855
tags with respect to 15 different spatial location
dimensions of arms, shoulder, trunk and legs.

Disfluencies At the moment, this annotation is
fully manual (we just developed a tool helping the
process in identifying disfluencies, but it has not
yet been evaluated). Annotating this phenomenon
requires 15mns for 1 minute of the corpus. The
following table illustrates the fact that disfluen-
cies are speaker-dependent in terms of quantity
and type. These figures also shows that disfluen-
cies affect lexicalized words as well as grammati-
cal ones.

Syntax We used the stochastic parser developed
at the LPL (Blache&Rauzy, 2008) to automaticaly
generate morppho-syntactic and syntactic annota-
tions. The parser has been adapted it in order to ac-
count for the specificities of speech analysis. First,
the system implements a segmentation technique,
identifying large syntactic units that can be consi-
dered as the equivalent of sentences in written
texts. This technique distinguishes between strong
and weak or soft punctuation marks. A second mo-
dification concerns the lexical frequencies used by
the parser model in order to capture phenomena
proper to conversational data.

4 Evaluations
Prosodic annotation : Prosodic annotation of
1 dialogue has been done by 2 experts. The
annotators worked separately using Praat. Inter-
transcriber agreement studies were done for the
annotation of higher prosodic units. First anno-
tator marked 3,159 and second annotator 2,855
188
Intonational Phrases. Mean percentage of inter-
transcriber agreement was 91.4% and mean
kappa-statistics 0.79, which stands for a quite sub-
stantial agreement.
Gesture : We performed a measure of inter-
reliability for three independent coders for Gesture
Space. The measure is based on Cohen?s correc-
ted kappa coefficient for the validation of coding
schemes (Carletta96).
Three coders have annotated three minutes for
GestureSpace including GestureRegion and Ges-
tureCoordinates. The kappa values indicated that
the agreement is high for GestureRegion of right
hand (kappa = 0.649) and left hand (kappa =
0.674). However it is low for GestureCoordinates
of right hand (k= 0.257) and left hand (k= 0.592).
Such low agreement of GestureCoordinates might
be due to several factors. First, the number of ca-
tegorical values is important.
Second, three minutes might be limited in terms
of data to run a kappa measure. Third, GestureRe-
gion affects GestureCoordinates : if the coders di-
sagree about GestureRegion, they are likely to also
annotate GestureCoordinates in a different way.
For instance, it was decided that no coordinate
would be selected for a gesture in the center-center
region, whereas there is a coordinate value for ges-
tures occurring in other parts of the GestureRe-
gion. This means that whenever coders disagree
between the center-center or center region, the an-
notation of the coordinates cannot be congruent.
5 Information representation
5.1 XML encoding
Our approach consists in first precisely define
the organization of annotations in terms of typed-
feature structures. We obtain an abstract descrip-
tion from which we automatically generate a for-
mal schema in XML. All the annotations are then
encoded following this schema.
Our XML schema, besides a basic encoding of
data following AIF, encode all information concer-
ning the organization as well as the constraints on
the structures. In the same way as TFS are used
as a tree description language in theories such as
HPSG, the XML schema generated from our TFS
representation also plays the same role with res-
pect to the XML annotation data file. On the one
hand, basic data are encoded with AIF, on the
other hand, the XML schema encode all higher
level information. Both components (basic data +
structural constraints) guarantee against informa-
tion loss that otherwise occurs when translating
from one coding format to another (for example
from Anvil to Praat).
5.2 Querying
To ease the multimodal exploitation of the data,
our objective is to provide a set of operators dedi-
cated to concurrent querying on hierarchical an-
notation. Concurrent querying consists in que-
rying annotations belonging to two or more mo-
dalities or even in querying the relationships bet-
ween modalities. For instance, we want to be able
to express queries over gestures and intonation
contours (what kind of intonational contour does
the speaker use when he looks at the listener ?).
We also want to be able to query temporal relation-
ships (in terms of anticipation, synchronization or
delay) between both gesture strokes and lexical af-
filiates.
Our proposal is to define these operators as an
extension of XQuery. From the XML encoding
and the temporal alignment of annotated data, it
will possible to express queries to find patterns and
to navigate in the structure. We also want to en-
able a user to check predicates on parts of the cor-
pus using classical criteria on values, annotations
and existing relationships (temporal or structural
ones corresponding to inclusions or overlaps bet-
ween annotations). First, we shall rely on one of
our previous proposal called MSXD (MultiStruc-
tured XML Document). It is a XML-compatible
model designed to describe and query concurrent
hierarchical structures defined over the same tex-
tual data which supports Allen?s relations.
6 Conclusion
Multimodal annotation is often reduced to
the encoding of gesture, eventually accompa-
nied with another level of linguistic information
(e.g. morpho-syntax). We reported in this paper a
broad-coverage approach, aiming at encoding all
the linguistic domains into a unique framework.
We developed for this a set of conventions and
tools making it possible to bring together and align
all these different pieces of information. The result
is the CID (Corpus of Interactional Data), the first
large corpus of conversational data bearing rich
annotations on all the linguistic domains.
