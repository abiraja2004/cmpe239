Abstract 
Speech recognition affords automobile 
drivers a hands-free, eyes-free method of 
replying to Short Message Service (SMS) 
text messages. Although a voice search 
approach based on template matching has 
been shown to be more robust to the chal-
lenging acoustic environment of automo-
biles than using dictation, users may have 
difficulties verifying whether SMS re-
sponse templates match their intended 
meaning, especially while driving. Using a 
high-fidelity driving simulator, we com-
pared dictation for SMS replies versus 
voice search in increasingly difficult driv-
ing conditions. Although the two ap-
proaches did not differ in terms of driving 
performance measures, users made about 
six times more errors on average using 
dictation than voice search. 
1 Introduction 
Users love Short Message Service (SMS) text 
messaging; so much so that 3 trillion SMS mes-
sages are expected to have been sent in 2009 
alone (Stross, 2008). Because research has 
shown that SMS messaging while driving results 
in 35% slower reaction time than being intox-
icated (Reed & Robbins, 2008), campaigns have 
been launched by states, governments and even 
cell phone carriers to discourage and ban SMS 
messaging while driving (DOT, 2009). Yet, au-
tomobile manufacturers have started to offer in-
fotainment systems, such as the Ford Sync, 
which feature the ability to listen to incoming 
SMS messages using text-to-speech (TTS). Au-
tomatic speech recognition (ASR) affords users a 
hands-free, eyes-free method of replying to SMS 
messages. However, to date, manufacturers have 
not established a safe and reliable method of le-
veraging ASR, though some researchers have 
begun to explore techniques. In previous re-
search (Ju & Paek, 2009), we examined three 
ASR approaches to replying to SMS messages: 
dictation using a language model trained on SMS 
responses, canned responses using a probabilistic 
context-free grammar (PCFG), and a ?voice 
search? approach based on template matching. 
Voice search proceeds in two steps (Natarajan et 
al., 2002): an utterance is first converted into 
text, which is then used as a search query to 
match the most similar items of an index using 
IR techniques (Yu et al, 2007). For SMS replies, 
we created an index of SMS response templates, 
with slots for semantic concepts such as time and 
place, from a large SMS corpus. After convolv-
ing recorded SMS replies so that the audio would 
exhibit the acoustic characteristics of in-car rec-
ognition, they compared how the three approach-
es handled the convolved audio with respect to 
the top n-best reply candidates. The voice search 
approach consistently outperformed dictation and 
canned responses, achieving as high as 89.7% 
task completion with respect to the top 5 reply 
candidates. 
Even if the voice search approach may be 
more robust to in-car noise, this does not guaran-
tee that it will be more usable. Indeed, because 
voice search can only match semantic concepts 
contained in the templates (which may or may 
not utilize the same wording as the reply), users 
must verify that a retrieved template matches the 
semantics of their intended reply. For example, 
suppose a user replies to the SMS message ?how 
about lunch? with ?can?t right now running er-
rands?. Voice search may find ?nope, got er-
rands to run? as the closest template match, in 
which case, users will have to decide whether 
this response has the same meaning as their re-
ply. This of course entails cognitive effort, which 
is very limited in the context of driving. On the 
other hand, a dictation approach to replying to 
SMS messages may be far worse due to misre-
cognitions. For example, dictation may interpret 
?can?t right now running errands? as ?can right 
313
now fun in errands?. We posited that voice 
search has the advantage because it always gene-
rates intelligible SMS replies (since response 
templates are manually filtered), as opposed to 
dictation, which can sometimes result in unpre-
dictable and nonsensical misrecognitions. How-
ever, this advantage has not been empirically 
demonstrated in a user study. This paper presents 
a user study investigating how the two approach-
es compare when users are actually driving ? that 
is, when usability matters most. 
2 Driving Simulator Study 
Although ASR affords users hands-free, eyes-
free interaction, the benefits of leveraging speech 
can be forfeit if users are expending cognitive 
effort judging whether the speech interface cor-
rectly interpreted their utterances. Indeed, re-
search has shown that the cognitive demands of 
dialogue seem to play a more important role in 
distracting drivers than physically handling cell 
phones (Nunes & Recarte, 2002; Strayer & 
Johnston, 2001). Furthermore, Kun et al (2007) 
have found that when in-car speech interfaces 
encounter recognition problems, users tend to 
drive more dangerously as they attempt to figure 
out why their utterances are failing. Hence, any 
approach to replying to SMS messages in auto-
mobiles must avoid distracting drivers with er-
rors and be highly usable while users are en-
gaged in their primary task, driving. 
2.1 Method 
To assess the usability and performance of both 
the voice search approach and dictation, we con-
ducted a controlled experiment using the STISIM 
Drive? simulator. Our simulation setup con-
sisted of a central console with a steering wheel 
and two turn signals, surrounded by three 47?? 
flat panels placed at a 45? angle to immerse the 
driver. Figure 1 displays the setup. 
We recruited 16 participants (9 males, 7 fe-
males) through an email sent to employees of our 
organization. The mean age was 38.8. All partic-
ipants had a driver?s license and were compen-
sated for their time.  
We examined two independent variables: SMS 
Reply Approach, consisting of voice search and 
dictation, and Driving Condition, consisting of 
no driving, easy driving and difficult driving. We 
included Driving Condition as a way of increas-
ing cognitive demand (see next section). Overall, 
we conducted a 2 (SMS Reply Approach) ? 3 
(Driving Condition) repeated measures, within-
subjects design experiment in which the order of 
SMS Reply for each Driving Condition was coun-
ter-balanced. Because our primary variable of 
interest was SMS Reply, we had users experience 
both voice search and dictation with no driving 
first, then easy driving, followed by difficult 
driving. This gave users a chance to adjust them-
selves to increasingly difficult road conditions. 
 
Driving Task: As the primary task, users were 
asked to drive two courses we developed with 
easy driving and difficult driving conditions 
while obeying all rules of the road, as they would 
in real driving and not in a videogame. With 
speed limits ranging from 25 mph to 55 mph, 
both courses contained five sequential sections 
which took about 15-20 minutes to complete: a 
residential area, a country highway, and a small 
city with a downtown area as well as a busi-
ness/industrial park. Although both courses were 
almost identical in the number of turns, curves, 
stops, and traffic lights, the easy course consisted 
mostly of simple road segments with relatively 
no traffic, whereas the difficult course had four 
times as many vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. 
The difficult course also included a foggy road 
section, a few busy construction sites, and many 
unexpected events, such as a car in front sudden-
ly breaking, a parked car merging into traffic, 
and a pedestrian jaywalking. In short, the diffi-
cult course was designed to fully engage the at-
tention and cognitive resources of drivers.  
 
SMS Reply Task: As the secondary task, we 
asked users to listen to an incoming SMS mes-
sage together with a formulated reply, such as: 
(1) Message Received: ?Are you lost?? Your 
Reply: ?No, never with my GPS? 
The users were asked to repeat the reply back to 
the system. For Example (1) above, users would 
have to utter ?No, never with my GPS?. Users

314
could also say ?Repeat? if they had any difficul-
ties understanding the TTS rendering or if they 
experienced lapses in attention. For each course, 
users engaged in 10 SMS reply tasks. SMS mes-
sages were cued every 3000 feet, roughly every 
90 seconds, which provided enough time to 
complete each SMS dialogue. Once users uttered 
the formulated reply, they received a list of 4 
possible reply candidates (each labeled as ?One?, 
?Two?, etc.), from which they were asked to ei-
ther pick the correct reply (by stating its number 
at any time) or reject them all (by stating ?All 
wrong?). We did not provide any feedback about 
whether the replies they picked were correct or 
incorrect in order to avoid priming users to pay 
more or less attention in subsequent messages. 
Users did not have to finish listening to the entire 
list before making their selection.  
 
Stimuli: Because we were interested in examin-
ing which was worse, verifying whether SMS 
response templates matched the meaning of an 
intended reply, or deciphering the sometimes 
nonsensical misrecognitions of dictation, we de-
cided to experimentally control both the SMS 
reply uttered by the user as well as the 4-best list 
generated by the system. However, all SMS rep-
lies and 4-best lists were derived from the logs of 
an actual SMS Reply interface which imple-
mented the dictation and the voice search ap-
proaches (see Ju & Paek, 2009). For each course, 
5 of the SMS replies were short (with 3 or fewer 
words) and 5 were long (with 4 to 7 words). The 
mean length of the replies was 3.5 words (17.3 
chars). The order of the short and long replies 
was randomized. 
We selected 4-best lists where the correct an-
swer was in each of four possible positions (1-4) 
or All Wrong; that is, there were as many 4-best 
lists with the first choice correct as there were 
with the second choice correct, and so forth. We 
then randomly ordered the presentation of differ-
ent 4-best lists. Although one might argue that 
the four positions are not equally likely and that 
the top item of a 4-best list is most often the cor-
rect answer, we decided to experimentally con-
trol the position for two reasons: first, our pre-
vious research (Ju & Paek, 2009) had already 
demonstrated the superiority of the voice search 
approach with respect to the top position (i.e., 1-
best), and second, our experimental design 
sought to identify whether the voice search ap-
proach was more usable than the dictation ap-
proach even when the ASR accuracy of the two 
approaches was the same. 
In the dictation condition, the correct answer 
was not always an exact copy of the reply in 0-2 
of the 10 SMS messages. For instance, a correct 
dictation answer for Example (1) above was ?no 
I?m never with my GPS?. On the other hand, the 
voice search condition had more cases (2-4 mes-
sages) in which the correct answer was not an 
exact copy (e.g., ?no I have GPS?) due to the 
nature of the template approach. To some degree, 
this could be seen as handicapping the voice 
search condition, though the results did not re-
flect the disadvantage, as we discuss later. 
 
Measures: Performance for both the driving task 
and the SMS reply tasks were recorded. For the 
driving task, we measured the numbers of colli-
sions, speeding (exceeding 10 mph above the 
limit), traffic light and stop sign violations, and 
missed or incorrect turns. For the SMS reply 
task, we measured duration (i.e., time elapsed 
between the beginning of the 4-best list and 
when users ultimately provided their answer) and 
the number of times users correctly identified 
which of the 4 reply candidates contained the 
correct answer. 
Originally, we had an independent rater verify 
the position of the correct answer in all 4-best 
lists, however, we considered that some partici-
pants might be choosing replies that are semanti-
cally sufficient, even if they are not exactly cor-
rect. For example, a 4-best list generated by the 
dictation approach for Example (1) had: ?One: 
no I?m never want my GPS. Two: no I?m never 
with my GPS. Three: no I?m never when my 
GPS. Or Four: no no I?m in my GPS.? Although 
the rater identified the second reply as being 
?correct?, a participant might view the first or 
third replies as sufficient. In order to avoid am-
biguity about correctness, after the study, we 
showed the same 16 participants the SMS mes-
sages and replies as well as the 4-best lists they 
received during the study and asked them to se-
lect, for each SMS reply, any 4-best list items 
they felt sufficiently conveyed the same mean-
ing, even if the items were ungrammatical. Par-
ticipants were explicitly told that they could se-
lect multiple items from the 4-best list. We did 
not indicate which item they selected during the 
experiment and because this selection task oc-
curred months after the experiment, it was un-
likely that they would remember anyway. Partic-
ipants were compensated with a cafeteria vouch-
er. 
In computing the number of ?correct? an-
swers, for each SMS reply, we counted an an-
315
swer to be correct if it was included among the 
participants? set of semantically sufficient 4-best 
list items. Hence, we calculated the number of 
correct items in a personalized fashion for every 
participant. 
2.2 Results 
We conducted a series of repeated measures 
ANOVAs on all driving task and SMS reply task 
measures. For the driving task, we did not find 
any statistically significant differences between 
the voice search and dictation conditions. In oth-
er words, we could not reject the null hypothesis 
that the two approaches were the same in terms 
of their influence on driving performance. How-
ever, for the SMS reply task, we did find a main 
effect for SMS Reply Approach (F1,47 = 81.28, p < 
.001, ?Dictation = 2.13 (.19), ?VoiceSearch = .38 (.10)). 
As shown in Figure 2, the average number of 
errors per driving course for dictation is roughly 
6 times that for voice search. We also found a 
main effect for total duration (F1,47 = 11.94, p < 
.01, ?Dictation = 113.75 sec (3.54) or 11.4 sec/reply, 
?VoiceSearch = 125.32 sec (3.37) or 12.5 sec/reply). 
We discuss our explanation for the shorter dura-
tion below. For both errors and duration, we did 
not find any interaction effects with Driving 
Conditions. 
3 Discussion 
We conducted a simulator study in order to ex-
amine which was worse while driving: verifying 
whether SMS response templates matched the 
meaning of an intended reply, or deciphering the 
sometimes nonsensical misrecognitions of dicta-
tion. Our results suggest that deciphering dicta-
tion results under the duress of driving leads to 
more errors. In conducting a post-hoc error anal-
ysis, we noticed that participants tended to err 
when the 4-best lists generated by the dictation 
approach contained phonetically similar candi-
date replies. Because it is not atypical for the dic-
tation approach to have n-best list candidates 
differing from each other in this way, we rec-
ommend not utilizing this approach in speech-
only user interfaces, unless the n-best list candi-
dates can be made as distinct from each other as 
possible, phonetically, syntactically and most 
importantly, semantically. The voice search ap-
proach circumvents this problem in two ways: 1) 
templates were real responses and manually se-
lected and cleaned up during the development 
phase so there were no grammatical mistakes, 
and 2) semantically redundant templates can be 
further discarded to only present the distinct con-
cepts at the rendering time using the paraphrase 
detection algorithms reported in (Wu et al, 
2010). 
Given that users committed more errors in the 
dictation condition, we initially expected that 
dictation would exhibit higher duration than 
voice search since users might be spending more 
time figuring out the differences between the 
similar 4-best list candidates generated by the 
dictation approach. However, in our error analy-
sis we observed that most likely users did not 
discover the misrecognitions, and prematurely 
selected a reply candidate, resulting in shorter 
durations. The slightly higher duration for the 
voice search approach does not constitute a prob-
lem if users are listening to all of their choices 
and correctly selecting their intended SMS reply. 
Note that the duration did not bring about any 
significant driving performance differences. 
Although we did not find any significant driv-
ing performance differences, users experienced 
more difficulties confirming whether the dicta-
tion approach correctly interpreted their utter-
ances than they did with the voice search ap-
proach. As such, if a user deems it absolutely 
necessary to respond to SMS messages while 
driving, our simulator study suggests that the 
most reliable (i.e., least error-prone) way to re-
spond may just well be the voice search ap-
proach.
