Abstract
A robust system that understands route instructions
should be able to process instructions generated nat-
urally by humans. Also desirable would be the abil-
ity to handle repairs and other modifications to exist-
ing instructions. To this end, we collected a corpus
of spoken instructions (and modified instructions)
produced by subjects provided with an origin and
a destination. We found that instructions could be
classified into four categories, depending on their
intent such as imperative, feedback, or meta com-
ment. We asked a different set of subjects to fol-
low these instructions to determine the usefulness
and comprehensibility of individual instructions. Fi-
nally, we constructed a semantic grammar and evalu-
ated its coverage. To determine whether instruction-
giving forms a predictable sub-language, we tested
the grammar on three corpora collected by others
and determined that this was largely the case. Our
work suggests that predictable sub-languages may
exist for well-defined tasks.

1 Introduction
Generating and interpreting instructions is a topic of en-
during interest. Cognitive psychologists have examined
how people perceive spatial entities and structure route
instructions (Daniel and Denis, 1998; Allen, 1997). Lin-
guists and others have investigated how people articulate
route instructions in conversation with people or agents
(Eberhard et al., 2010; Gargett et al., 2010; Stoia et al.,
2008; Marge and Rudnicky, 2010). Artificial intelligence
researchers have shown that under supervised conditions
autonomous agents can learn to interpret route instruc-
tions (Kollar et al., 2010; MacMahon et al., 2006; Ma-
tuszek et al., 2010; Bugmann et al., 2004; Chen and
Mooney, 2010).
While the subject has been approached from different
perspectives, it has been generally held that the language
of directions is mostly limited and only parts of the vo-
cabulary (such as location names) will vary from case to
case. We are interested in being able to interpret natural
directions, as might be given to a robot, and generating
corresponding trajectory. But natural directions contain
different types of information, some (more-or-less) eas-
ily interpreted (e.g., "go to the end of the hall") while
others seem daunting (e.g., "walk past the abstract mural
with birds"). So the question might actually be "is there
enough interpretable data in human directions to support
planning a usable trajectory?".
The language of instructions contains a variety of rel-
evant propositions: a preface to a route, an imperative
statement, or a description of a landmark. Previous work
has proposed both coarse and fine-grained instruction
taxonomies. (Bugmann et al., 2004) proposed a taxon-
omy of 15 primitive categories in a concrete ?action?
framework. In contrast, (Daniel and Denis, 1998) sug-
gested a five-way categorization based on cognitive prop-
erties of instructions.
Instructions vary greatly and can include superfluous
detail. (Denis et al., 1999) found that when people were
asked to read and assess a set of instructions some of the
instructions were deemed unnecessary and could be dis-
carded. There is some evidence (Lovelace et al., 1999;
Caduff and Timpf, 2008) that only the mention of sig-
nificant landmarks along the route leads to better-quality
instructions. Computational (rather than descriptive) ap-
proaches to this problem include: using sequence label-
ing approach to capture spatial relations, landmarks, and
action verbs (Kollar et al., 2010), generating a frame
structure for an instruction (MacMahon et al., 2006), or
using statistical machine translation techniques to trans-
late instructions into actions (Matuszek et al., 2010).
We describe a new instructions corpus, its analysis in
terms of a taxonomy suitable for automated understand-
ing and a verification that the instructions are in fact us-
able by humans. With a view to automating understand-
ing, we also constructed a grammar capable of processing
this language, and show that it provides good coverage
99
for both our corpus and three other corpora (Kollar et al.,
2010; Marge and Rudnicky, 2010; Bugmann et al., 2004)
This paper is organized as following: Section 2 de-
scribes the corpus collection study. Then in Section 3,
we discuss the taxonomy of route instructions. Section 4
focuses on which categories are important for navigation.
In Section 5, we report our results and error analysis on
parsing instructions from our corpus and three other cor-
pora containing route instructions, followed by lessons
learned and future work.
2 The Navagati1 Corpus
We collected a corpus of spoken instructions describing
how to get from one part of a large building complex
to another. To ensure consistency we recruited individ-
uals who were familiar with the environment and conse-
quently could formulate such instructions without refer-
ence to maps or other materials. Since we are ultimately
interested in how such instructions are edited, we also in-
cluded conditions in which subjects were asked to modify
their instructions in several ways. The corpus is publicly
available2.
2.1 Participants and Procedure
We recruited subjects who were both fluent English
speakers and were also familiar with the environment (a
university building complex). Subjects were told to imag-
ine that they had encountered a visitor, not familiar with
the campus, at a specific location (in front of elevators on
a particular floor) who needed instructions to a specific
location, a caf? two buildings away.
For each set of instructions, subjects were asked to
think about the route and their instructions, then record
them as a single monologue. Subjects sat in front of
a computer and wore a close-talking microphone. Ini-
tially no map was provided and they were expected to
rely on their memory. In subsequent tasks they were
shown a floor-plan indicating a specific location of the
visitor and asked to modify their instructions. Speech
was transcribed using Amazon Mechanical Turk, shown
to be a reliable resource for spoken language transcription
(Marge et al., 2010). Transcriptions were normalized to
standardize spellings (e.g., building names).
2.2 Design
Previous works have focused on eliciting route instruc-
tions between multiple pairs of locations. There is a gen-
eral agreement that the structure of instructions did not
vary with the increase in number of start-end location
pairs. However previous works have not looked at how
instructions would be modified under different situations.

We were interested in two general cases: normal in-
structions (Simple scenario) and repairing existing in-
structions (Repair scenario). Each scenario included
three tasks, as described below.
We selected two locations that could be walked be-
tween without necessarily going outside. However the
subjects were free to to give instructions for a route of
their choice between a location pair. The first location (A)
was in front of an elevator on the seventh floor of Gates
Hillman Center, the second location (B) was a cafe on the
fifth floor of Wean Hall. The expected pathway included
changes in floor, direction and passing through a different
building. It required reasonably detailed instructions.
In the Simple scenario, subjects were asked to generate
three variants, as follows: (1) instructions for A? B; (2)
for B ? A; and (3) a simplified version of (2).
The motivation behind (2) is to learn whether people
would make references about the parts of the route that
were previously traversed in the opposite direction. In
the case of (3), we were interested in the degree of in-
struction reuse and the condensation strategy. We explic-
itly told the subject ?Imagine that the visitor found your
instructions confusing. They asked you to simplify the
instructions. How would you do that??
The Repair scenario was designed to probe how a sub-
ject would alter their instructions in response to compli-
cations. Subjects were asked to modify their intial Simple
instructions (A ? B) to cope with: (1) visitor missing a
landmark and takes a wrong turn; (2) an obstruction (con-
struction) blocking the original path; and (3) the visitor
getting lost and ends up in an unknown part of the (mid-
dle) building. For each case, the subject was given a map
(as in figure 1) that marked the visitor?s location and had
to get the visitor back on track.
Figure 1: Map of the construction area (marked as star)
The tasks in this scenario were designed to see whether
people modify directions differently when three different
situations are presented. Precisely, we want to know if
100
there is any difference in the discourse structure and ver-
bosity of the directions.
2.3 Analysis
Nine subjects performed 6 tasks each, producing 54 sets
of instructions, for a total of 65 minutes of speech. Please
note that other corpora in the route instructions domain
have similiar scale (see Figure 5(a)). The transcriptions
were segmented semi-automatically into atomic units
corresponding to instruction steps. For example, the in-
struction ?Go left, then turn right? was segmented into:
?go left?, and ?then turn right? based on bigram heuris-
tics. We compiled a list of most frequent bigrams and
trigrams in the corpus e.g., ?and then?, ?after that? etc.
The transcriptions were segmented at the bigram/trigram
boundaries and were manually verified for the correctness
of a segment. The Simple scenario generated 552 instruc-
tions, the Repair part contained 382 instructions, a total
of 934. The vocabulary has 508 types and 7937 tokens.
Table 1 summarizes the factors measured in both the sce-
narios. Only two (marked by *) differed between scenar-
ios (t-test at p < 0.05). We examined acoustic properties
(for example mean pitch) but did not find any significant
differences across scenario type.
Table 1: Simple vs Repair Scenario
Factors Simple Repair
# Tokens 4461 3476
# Types 351 375
# Instructions 552 382
# Words-per-Instruction* 7.5 8.0
# Landmarks 450 314
# Motion Verbs* 775 506
# Spatial Prepositions 61 60
# Filler Phrases 414 380
We can compare language similarity across scenar-
ios by comparing the perplexity of text in the two sce-
narios. If the instructions and repairs are similar, we
would expect that a model built from one scenario should
be able to capture data from the other scenario. We
randomly divided data from each scenario into training
(70%) and testing data (30%). We built a trigram lan-
guage model (LM) smoothed with absolute discounting
using the CMU-SLM toolkit (Rosenfield, 1995). Then,
we computed the perplexity on testing data from each
scenario against each model. From Table 2, Simple-
LM has lower perplexity compared to Repair-LM on the
test sets. The perplexity of Simple-LM on Repair-Test
is slightly higher when compared to Simple-Test. This
could be due to the lexical diversity of the Repair scenario
or simply to the smaller sample size. Table 1 (row 1) indi-
cates that the data in Repair scenario is smaller than data
in Simple scenario. To explore the lexical diversity of
these two scenarios we conducted a qualitative analysis
of the instructions from both the scenarios.
In Task 1 of the Simple scenario, we only observed
a sequence of instructions. However in Task 2 of Simple
Scenario, we noticed references to instructions from Task
1 via words like ?remember?, ?same route?, etc. This
suggests that instructions may be considered in context of
previous exchanges and that this history should normally
be available for interpretation purposes. In Task 3 of the
Simple scenario, 7 out of 9 subjects simply repeated the
instructions from Task 2 while the rest provided a differ-
ent version of the same instructions. We did not observe
any other qualitative differences across three tasks in the
Simple scenario.
In Task 1 of the Repair scenario, all but one subject
gave instructions that returned the visitor to the missed
landmark, instead of bypassing the landmark. In Task 2,
the obstruction on the path could be negotiated through
a shorter or longer detour. But only 4 out of 9 partici-
pants suggested the shorter detour. In Task 3, we did not
observe anything different from Task 2. Despite the dif-
ference in the situations, the language of repair was found
to be quite similar. The structure of the delivery was orga-
nized as follows: (1) Subjects introduced the situation of
the visitor; (2) then modified the instructions according to
the situation. Introduction of the situation was different
in each task, (e.g., ?you are facing the workers? vs ?looks
like you are near office spaces? vs ?if you have missed
the atrium you took a wrong turn?). But the modification
or repair of the instructions was similar across the situa-
tions. The repaired instructions are sequences of instruc-
tions with a few cautionary statements inserted between
instructions. We believe that subjects added cautionary
statements in order to warn the visitor from going off-the-
route. We observed that 6.3% of the repaired instructions
were cautionary statements; we did not observe caution-
ary statements in the original Simple scenario. In order
to see the effect of these cautionary statements we re-
moved them from both training and testing sets of the
Repair scenario, then built a trigram LM using this con-
densed training data (Repair?w/o-cautionLM). Table 2
shows that perplexity drops when cautionary statements
are excluded from the repair scenario, indicating that
Simple and Repair scenarios are similar except for these
cautionary statements.
3 Taxonomy of Route Instructions
Taxonomies have been proposed in the past. Daniel
and Denis (1998) proposed a taxonomy that reflected at-
tributes of spatial cognition and included 5 classes: (1)
Imperatives; (2) Imperatives referring a landmark; (3)
Introduction of a landmark without an action; (4) Non-
spatial description of landmarks and (5) Meta comments.

Bugmann et al. (2004) suggested 15 primitive (robot-
executable) actions. We present a hierarchical instruction
taxonomy that takes into account both cognitive proper-
ties and the needs of robot navigation. This taxonomy is
based on 934 route instruction monologues. It should be
noted that this taxonomy is not based on dialog acts but
rather takes the intent of the instruction into the account.
3.1 Categories
We segmented the spoken instructions using a criterion
that split individual actions and observations. Our taxon-
omy is roughly comparable to that of (Daniel and Denis,
1998) but differs in the treatment of landmarks because
the mention of the landmarks in an instruction can be of
two types: contextual mention and positional mention.
Contextual Mention means when a landmark in the sur-
roundings but it is not on the path. On the other hand, po-
sitional mention requires the landmark to be on the path.
In our taxonomy, contextual mention becomes Advisory
instruction and positional mention is called Grounding
instruction. The taxonomy has four major categories that
subsume 18 sub-categories; these are given in Table 3.
For instance, ?You want to take a right? belongs to the
Imperative category. ?You will see a black door? is an
Advisory instruction about the surroundings. ?You are on
the first floor? denotes Grounding. ?Your destination is
located in another building and you will walk across three
buildings in this route? gives an overview of the route, a
Meta Comment. From Figure 2, we see that majority of
the route instructions are Imperative.

Figure 2: First Tier Instruction Categories
3.1.1 Imperative Instructions
Imperative instructions are executable and can result
in physical displacement. We identified seven subcate-
gories of Imperatives that distinguish different contexts
(e.g., going along a corridor, changing floors via elevator
or stairs, or going to a specific location).
Imperative instructions can also include preconditions
or postconditions. The order of their execution varies
based on the directionality of the condition between two
instructions. Continue is interesting because it can
have travel-distance and travel-direction arguments, or
even no arguments. In the latter case the follower contin-
ues an action (e.g., ?keep walking?), until some unspeci-
fied condition ends it.
3.1.2 Advisory Instructions
While giving route instructions people mention land-
marks along the route as feedback to the direction-
follower. Some of these landmarks are not part of the path
but do serve as waypoints for the follower (e.g., ?you will
see a hallway right there?). We observe that landmarks
are distinct either functionally and/or physically. For ex-
ample, a hallway is both functionally and physically dif-
ferent from an elevator but only physically different from
a door because both function as an instrument (or path) to
get from one place to another. Based on this distinction,
we divided advisory instructions into five sub-categories
depending on the type of landmark mentioned in the in-
struction (see Table 3).
Compound locations (see Table 3) are closely located
but physically distinct. They may constitute part-whole
relationships e.g., ?TV screen with a motion sensor?.
We observed that compound locations are used to disam-
biguate when multiple instances of a landmark type are
present e.g., ?chair near the elevator vs ?chair near the
hallway?.
3.1.3 Grounding Instructions
Grounding instructions report absolute position. These
instructions indicate current view or location as opposed
to future view or location (indicated through advisory
instructions). These instructions constitute a landmark
name similar to advisory instructions and also follow the
distinction between the type of landmark mentioned in
the instruction (see Table 3).
3.1.4 Meta Comments
Meta comments are non-executable instructions added
to route instructions. People often make these comments
at the beginning of instructions and sometimes in be-
tween two imperative statements e.g., a precautionary
statement. In our corpus we found meta-comments in
two situations: (1) Preface or introduction of the route;
(2) Caution against a (metaphorical) pitfall in the route.

Preface 49.3% I will guide you to the cafe in that building
Table 3: Taxonomy of Categories with Examples
Both the example instructions and the distribution of the
subcategories are given in Table 3.
The language of meta comments is more diverse than
that of the other three categories. If we build trigram
language models for each category and measure the per-
plexity on a held-out set from same category the perplex-
ity is relatively high for Meta (49.6) compared to other
categories (Advisory: 19.5; Imperative: 18.5; Ground-
ing: 11.4). This suggests that automatic understanding
of meta comments might be problematic, consequently it
would be useful to determine the ralative utility of differ-
ent instruction categories. The next section describes at
attempt to do this.
4 Which Instructions are Relevant?
Given a variety of information present in a set of route
instructions, we wanted to investigate whether all that in-
formation is relevant for navigation. In order to find that
out we devised a user study asking people to follow in-
structions collected in our previous study. (Daniel and
Denis, 1998) conducted a similar study where they asked
subjects to read a set of instructions and strike-off in-
structions with too much or too little information. How-
ever, people may or may not feel the same when they fol-
low (physically navigate) these instructions. Therefore,
in our study the experimenter read instructions (of vary-
ing amount of detail) to the subjects while they physically
navigated through the environment.
4.1 Participants and Procedure
We chose 5 out of the 9 instruction sets, spoken by differ-
ent subjects (of average length 26.8 instructions per set)
from Task 1 of the Simple scenario discussed above. We
did not use the others because they contained few instruc-
tions (average of 13.5) and provided fewer instances of
instructions in different categories. Also, we did not use
instructions from Repair Scenario because those instruc-
tions dependent on a scenario and a set of instructions
that were already provided to the direction follower.
Our set of instructions included the full set, a set with
only imperatives and additional sets adding only one of
the remaining categories to the imperative set (see Ta-
ble 4), producing 25 distinct sets of instructions. Addi-
tionally, building names and the destination name (tran-
scribed in the instructions) were anonymized to avoid re-
vealing the destination or the ?heading? at the early stage
of the route.
We recruited 25 subjects, each doing one variant of the
instructions. In the session, the experimenter read one in-
struction at a time to the subject and walked behind the
subject as they proceeded. Subjects were asked to say
?done? when ready for the next instruction; they were
allowed to ask the experimenter to repeat instructions but
otherwise were on their own. The experimenter kept track
of how and where a subject got lost on their way to des-
tination. (No systematic effects were observed, but see
below.) At the end subjects were handed the entire set of
instructions and were asked to mark which instructions
were difficult to follow and which were redundant. Re-
maining instructions were deemed to be useful and inter-
pretable.

4.2 Analysis
Except for one subject, everybody reached the destina-
tion. Subjects found Imperative and Advisory instruc-
tions more useful compared to Grounding instructions
and Meta comments, irrespective of the instruction-set
they followed (see Figure 3). Figure 3(a) shows percent-
age of category-wise difficult instructions in each vari-
ant of an instruction set and 3(b) shows percentage of
category-wise redundant instructions in each variant of an
instruction set. For e.g., Diff-Imp/Imp+Meta means that
12% of imperative-instructions are difficult in the Imper-
ative+Meta variant.
16 out 25 Subjects got lost at least once i.e., they misin-
terpreted an instruction, followed along wrong path, then
they realized inconsistencies with spatial information and
the following instruction, and finally recovered from the
misinterpreted instruction. A subject lost thrice in the en-
tire experiment who misunderstood one instruction twice
and another instruction once. The subject was lost at an
intersection of three hallways and only one of them leads
towards the destination. This instruction did not have
sufficient information about the next heading. All sub-
jects who recovered from misinterpretation informed that
landmark?s attributes such as number of floors in a build-
ing (if building is the landmark) and the spatial orienta-
tion of the landmark helped them in recovery.
Instructions that lacked spatial orientation were found
to be particularly difficult to follow. Subjects found a few
of the imperative and advisory instructions difficult to fol-
low. While following these difficult instructions, people
realized that they got lost and asked the experimenter to
repeat the instructions. Examples of difficult instructions
and the people?s complaint on that instruction are as fol-
lows:
? So you kind of cross the atrium Complaint: partic-
ipants reported that they were not sure how far they
had to walk across the atrium.
? Go beside the handrails till the other end of this
building Complaint: no absolute destination, mul-
tiple hallways at the end of handrails
? Just walk down the hallway exit the building Com-
plaint: multiple exits to the building
? After you get off the elevator, take a left and then left
again Complaint: more than one left confused the
subjects
? You can see the building just in front of you Com-
plaint: there were three buildings standing in front
and the target building was slightly to the left.
? You will see the corridor that you want to take Com-
plaint: there were two corridors and the orientation
was unspecified in the instruction
5 Understanding Experiments
The Navagati (NAV) corpus instructions were divided
into training set (henceforth abbreviated as NAV-train)
and testing set (abbreviated as NAV-test) of size 654 (of 6
subjects) and 280 (of 3 subjects). The training set was
used to create a grammar based on the taxonomy de-
scribed in Section 3.
5.1 Grammar
A domain-specific grammar was written to cover most
frequent phrases from the training set using the Phoenix
(Ward, 1991) format. Phoenix grammars specify a hier-
archy of target concepts and is suited to parsing spon-
taneous speech. The resulting grammar produced cor-
rect and complete parses on 78% of the training data
(NAV-train). The remaining training instances were not
included due to unusual phrasing and disfluencies. The
concepts in the grammar are listed in the Table 5.
5.1.1 Managing Variable Vocabulary
Concepts such as Locations, Pathways and Adjectives-
of-Location use vocabulary that is specific to an environ-
ment, and the vocabulary of these concepts will change

with surroundings. We used an off-the-shelf part-of-
speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) on NAV-train to
identify ?location-based? nouns and adjectives. These
were added to the grammar as instances of their respec-
tive concepts.
5.2 Parsing NAV Instructions
A parse can fall into one of the following categories: 1)
Complete: clean and correct parse with all concepts and
actions mentioned in the instruction. 2) Incomplete: If
some arguments for an action are missing. 3) Misparse:
no usable parse produced for an instruction.
Table 6 shows that 87% of the instructions from the
NAV corpus (excluding meta comments) are parsed cor-
rectly. Correct parses were produced for 89% of Imper-
atives, 87% of Advisory and 73% of Grounding instruc-
tions. Meta comments were excluded because they do
not constitute any valid actions and can be ignored. Nev-
ertheless 20% of the meta comments produced a valid
parse (i.e. unintended action).
5.3 Grammar Generality
The results for the NAV corpus seem encouraging but it
would be useful to know whether the NAV grammar gen-
eralizes to other directions scenarios. We selected three
corpora to examine this question: MIT (Kollar et al.,
2010), IBL3 (Bugmann et al., 2004) and TTALK4 (Marge
and Rudnicky, 2010). All were navigation scenarios but
were collected in a variety of settings (see Figure 4(a)).
Corpus vocabularies were normalized using the process
described in 5.1.1 and location specific nouns and adjec-
tives added to the grammar. Punctuation was removed.
Figure 4(b) shows the type-token ratios for ?variable?
concepts. There are more landmarks and adjectives (that
tag along landmarks) in NAV and MIT compared to IBL
and fewest in TTALK corpus (a closed space with two
robots). Since, IBL and TTALK do not involve exten-
sive navigation inside the buildings there are no instances
of the elevator concept. However, IBL corpus has ?ex-
its, roads, streets? in the city environment which were
included in the PathWay concept.
5.4 Performance across Corpora
We randomly sampled 300 instructions from each of the
three corpora (MIT, IBL and TTALK) and evaluated their
parses against manually-created parses. Table 6) shows
results for each type of parse (Complete, Incomplete, or
Misparse). Meta comments were excluded, as discussed
earlier. The NAV grammar appears portable to three other
corpora. As shown in Category-Accuracy of Table 6 Im-
peratives and Advisory instructions are well-parsed by
the grammar. In TTALK corpus, there are very few land-
mark names but there are certain unusual sentences e.g.,
?she to the rear left hand wall of the room? causing lower
accuracy in Advisory instructions. We noticed that MIT
corpus had longer description of the landmarks, leading
to lower accuracy for Grounding. From Table 6 11% to
16% of Imperative instructions fail to get parsed across
the corpora. We consider these failures/errors below.
5.5 Error Analysis
We found six situations that produced incomplete and
misparsed instructions: (1) Underspecified arguments;
(2) Unusual or unobserved phrases; (2) False-starts and
ungrammatical language; (3) Uncovered words; (4) Pro-
longed description of landmarks within an instruction;

5.5.1 Incomplete and Misparsed Instructions
Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words were responsible for
the majority of incomplete parses across all the corpora;
many were singletons. Unusual phrases such as ?as if you
are doubling back on yourself? caused incomplete parses.
We also observed lengthy descriptions in instructions in
the MIT corpus, leading to incomplete parses. This cor-
pus was unusual in that it is composed of written, as op-
posed to spoken, instructions.
Misparsed instructions were caused due to both un-
grammatical phrases and OOV words. Ungrammatical
instructions contained either missed key content words
like verbs or false starts. These instructions did contain
meaningful fragments but they did not form a coherent
utterance e.g., ?onto a roundabout?.
We note that incomplete or otherwise non-
understandable utterancess can in principle be recovered
through clarification dialog (see e.g., (Bohus and Rud-
nicky, 2005). Direction giving should perhaps not be
limited to monologue delivery.

6 Conclusion
To better understand the structure of instructions and to
investigate how these might be automatically processed,
we collected a corpus of spoken instructions. We found
that instructions can be organized in terms of a straighfor-
ward two-level taxonomy. We examined the information
contents of different components and found that that the
Imperative and Advisory categories appear to be the most
relevant, though our subjects had little difficulty dealing
with instructions composed of only Imperatives; physical
context would seem to matter.
We found that it was possible to design a grammar that
reasonably covered the information-carrying instructions
in a set of instructions. And that a grammar built from our
corpus generalized quite well to corpora collected under
different circumstances.
Our study suggests that robust instruction-
understanding systems can be implemented and,
other than the challenge of dealing with location-specific
data, can be deployed in different environments. We
believe that this study also highlights the importance
of dialog-based clarification and the need for strate-
gies that can recognize and capture out-of-vocabulary
words. These capabilities are being incorporated into a
robot navigation system that can take instructions from
humans.
