ABSTRACT 
This paper looks at the use in machine Trans lat ion 
systems of the l inguist ic models of Case and Valency. 
It is argued that neither of these models was 
or iginal ly developed with this use in mind, and both 
must be adapted somewhat to meet this purpose. In 
part icular,  the tradit ional  Valency dist inct ion of 
complements and adjuncts leads to conf l icts when 
valency frames in di f ferent languages are compared: a 
finer but more f lexible dist inct ion is required. 
Also, these concepts must be extended beyond the 
verb, to include the noun and adjective as valency 
bearers. As far as Case is concerned, too narrow an 
approach has tradit ional ly  been taken: work in this 
f ield has been too conerned only with cases for 
arguments in verb frames; case label systems for non- 
valency bound elements and also for elements Jn 
nominal groups must be elaborated. The paper 
suggests an integrated approach speci f ical ly  or iented 
towards the part icular  problems found in MT. 
\ ] .  Introduct ion 
Most (though not all) MT systems claim to incorporate 
versions of Valency grammar, and more recent ly  have 
also looked to Case grammar. However, whatever  
theory they use is often imported more or less 
directly, without taking account of the fact that a 
model developed for one purpose may not be ent irely 
appropriate for another. This is a less serious 
problem for Valency, though this was or iginal ly 
designed with a monol ingual  didactic purpose in mind 
(see Helbig & Schenkel, 1973:5) rather than the 
mult i l ing~al  needs of translation. With Case 
however, it is often the much-mal igned and quickly 
supereeded Fi l lmore (1968) model which is adopted, or 
at best a 'consensus' model like that of F i l lmore 
(1971) or Chafe (1970), loosely extended. What is 
not taken into account is the fact that these models 
typical ly concentrate on 'nuclear' arguments in verb- 
phrases, saying l itt le about 'peripheral' roles, or 
about the structure of nominal or even adject ival  
groups. This paper will show need for a more task- 
specif ic model, combining Valency and Case into an 
integrated theory for the purposes of translat ion. 
More specif ical ly,  we will show (a) the need for a 
more f lexible Valency system with six degrees of 
valency-binding instead of the usual two; (b) the 
need for a f inely tuned version of Case to fit the 
new version of Valency proposed: in part icular  what 
depth of abstract ion is appropriate; and (c) the need 
for this combined Case and Valency model to extend 
beyond verbs, especial ly to nominal groups. 
2. Valency in exist ing MT sys tems 
The essential  notion borrowed from Valency theory 
found in MT is the dist inct ion between 'complements' 
and 'adjuncts'. In several MT systems we find that 
the lexicon contains information equivalent to that 
given in a valency dict ionary like that of Helbig & 
Schenkel (1973) l ist ing the complements predicted by 
the verb together with associated syntactic and 
semantic features. This lexical information is used 
in a stra ightforward manner to assist in the 
computat ion of structured representat ions for the 
source text, with the complements and adjuncts 
label led appropriately.  In this way for example, the 
funct ions of the preposi t ions in sentences like (la) 
and (2a) can be di f ferent iated,  and the correct 
translat ions (ib-2b) arr ived at. 
la) Er wartet auf seinem Freund. 
\]b) He is wait ing for his fr iend. 
2a) Er wafter auf dem Bahnhof. 
2b) He is wait ing at the station. 
The ident i f icat ion of complements is useful in the 
bi l ingual  transfer stage (or equivalent) of the MT 
system, and it is appropr iate at this point to 
provide a set of example translat ion pairs (3)-(5) 
that i l lustrate an important problem that Valency can 
help with. 
(3a) He l ikes the girl. 
(3b) La fi l le lui plait. 
4a) The farmer suppl ied the grocer with milk. 
4b) Le fermier fournit du lait a l '$picier.  
5a) CharIes entered the'restaurant.  
(5b) Charles entra darts le restaurant.  
Each of the sentence-pairs  in (3)-(5) i l lustrates a 
change in complement structure between Engl ish and 
French. The example with l ike and plaire is 
something of a classic, involving a double argument 
change; but examples l ike (4) and (5), which, whi le 
less extreme, are nevertheless typical, suggest that 
the phenomenon is widespread. 
The Valency approach to this problem recognises each 
of the three verb pairs in (3)-(5) as having the same 
valency, but as having dif ferent valency patterns, 
which must be mapped onto each other. 
In the case of Rothkegel (1976), this mapping is 
achieved by simpIy juxtaposing the two entries, with 
equivalent arguments next to each other, roughly as 
in Figure i. 
supply Ns (animate) No (animate) Np (with,physobj) 
fournir  Ns (animate) Ni (animate) No (physobj) 
Figure i. Valency patterns in Rothkegel (1976) 
Alternat ively,  in GETA's ARIANE-78 (Vauquois, 1978) 
and TAUM-Aviat ion (Lehrberger, 1981), the complements 
are assigned dist inct ive labels: in both systems the 
label ARG(ument)  is used with a dist inct ive aff ixed 
numeral,  roughly as in (6).

less free in this sense. These are sentence 
modif iers,  such as as ment ioned above, indeed, inn 
contrast to this and so on. 
Notice that the scope of each type of element is the 
predicate plus those elements above it on the scale. 
Thus, middles pertain to the predicate plus 
complements; adjuncts modi fy  this extended 
predication; extra-per ipherals  range over the entire 
sentence. 
4? How the extended system helps in MT 
Let us now consider the effect of this concept on 
mapping of arguments in transfer in MT. We assume 
that the general transfer a lgor i thm has the 
possib i l i ty  of correct ly matching complements in 
corresponding valency patterns (whether by arbi i t rary 
numbering, on a verb-by-verb basis, or using Case). 
We also assume that adjuncts and extra-per ipherals  
can be dealt with sat isfactor i ly.  We must now 
consider what to do when, on a bi l ingual  basis, 
there is some mismatch between the valency bindings 
of corresponding elements. Notice that this is a 
major problem in the old two-valued system. 
Tile most l ikely rea l isat ion of this problem seems to 
be as  follows: assume that in a source l anguage 
analysis of (8), with a stone has been assigned our 
'middle' label, whereas in the target language either 
(i) the equivalent argument is considered to be 
valency-bound for the predicate; or (ii) the 
equivalent argument would be regarded as whol ly 
circumstantial .  In the case of (i) we can treat the 
element as if it had been a complement all along: the 
valency pattern for the target verb wil l  tell us what 
to do with it. L ikewise in the case of (ii) we can 
treat it as if we always knew it was an adjunct: 
depending on the nature of the a lgor i thm for treat ing 
ad juncts ,  we  may be  requ i red  to  compute  some more  
in fo rmat ion  about  i t  ( i t s  case  ro le  fo r  example) ,  but  
th i s  i s  no  prob lem.  
It is easy to see that a genera l isat ion of this 
solut ion is one in which each degree of valency-  
binding in Figure 2 is al lowed to map onto either 
itself, or its nearest neighbour in either direct ion. 
Thus, integral complements and ordinary complements 
should be compatible, as should adjuncts and extra- 
peripherals.  This blurr ing of the dist inct i ions up 
and down the hierarchy accords well with intuit ions, 
which suggest that because the syntactic (and 
semantic) behaviour of elements at neighbourdng 
points on the hierarchy have aspects in common, 
partial  compatibi l i ty  should be achievable. If we 
add, at the very top of the hierarchy, a not ional  
empty or 'zero' binding, we are even able to account 
for those cases where a verb plus integral complement 
in one language is expressed as a simple lexical verb 
in another, as for example with the Engl ish and 
French pairs in (9): 
(9 )  take part part ic iper  
make a mistake se tromper 
catch cold s enrhumer 
welcome fairs accueil  
reverse marcher  en arr iSre 
stroke donner une carcase 
Problems would arise if analyses of two languages 
were so dif ferent that a complement in one was 
120 
regarded as an adjunct in another (though note that 
in the current two-value system, this is common), or 
an integral  mapped onto a middle,  and so on. Nothing 
much could be done in such a case, and it can only be 
said that the single condit ion upon which this system 
depends is that that s i tuat ion simply does not arise. 
However, there is a second problem aris ing from the 
quest ion of non-match ing valency patterns, and 
indeed, this is a problem for which Case seems to 
offer a solution. The problem is this: in language 
A, verb V is considered to have two valency-bound 
arguments,  but in language B, the corresponding verb 
takes three complements.  When we come to transfer 
between A and B, how do we know which two of the 
three complements speci f ied for V in language B map 
onto the two speci f ied for V in language A? 
5. Case in MT 
Compared to the number of systems using Valency, 
there are re lat ive ly  few systems that use Case in MT, 
even though there are a number of problems, as we 
have seen, with the bare Valency approach. Yet Case 
obviously has attract ions for MT, especia l ly  due to 
its character as a bridge between syntax and 
semantics. There is some dispute as to what amount 
of 'semantics' is needed for successful  t ranslat ion,  
or indeed whether  Case can properly be descr ibed as 
being part of this ~omain. 
Nevertheless,  we have seen in the previous sections 
at least two problems which, we suggested, could be 
solved using Case. The f irst was the l ike/p la i re 
example, wbere we had to have a special mapping 
algorithm, whether  between arbitrary ARG labels, or 
between numbered ARG labels interpreted in terms of 
syntactic function. The point about case labels in 
this example is that they will provide a non- 
arbitrary transfer medium which is intuit ive in both 
languages. If we extend the system to make it 
mult i l ingual ,  the case for Case is even stronger, 
since it provides a single language-pair  independent 
mapping in contrast to the necessary n(n-l) (for 
languges) bi l ingual  mappings,  which might, remember, 
need to be repl icated for almost every verb. Even in 
the problem case above, where analyses required non- 
neighbour mapping, a solut ion in terms of case labels 
suggests that the va lency-b lnding labels can be 
ignored where they do not help us. And the Case 
solut ion to the f inal problem ment ioned above - how 
to identi fy which arguments are considered in both 
languages to be va lency-bound - is self -evident.  
The point about Case is that it exact ly meets the 
need in MT for a level of representat ion that is both 
deep enough to serve in a manner  re lat ive ly  
independent of surface form, while stil l  being 
shal low enough to al low a fair ly stra ightforward 
mapping from and onto these other levels of 
descr ipt ion (i.e. surface syntax, canonical  form, 
etc.). This view is countered by Tsuj i i  (1982:382), 
who claims that with only the shal low meaning 
representat ion af forded by Case, one does not avoid 
the necessi ty to look still at specif ic verbs in 
order to interpret the case labels and so to 
determine the appropr iate strategy. But Tsuj i i  
wrongly attr ibutes to advocates of Case for MT the 
idea that it should replace other forms of label l ing 
in the representat ion of analysis. 
It should be made clear that indeed information about 
syntact ic conf igurat ion goes hand in hand with case 
structure information.  The int roduct ion of case 
labels permits certain genera l i sat ions  that can act 
as defaults to reduce the amount of expl ic i t  
in format ion associated with each verb, in the manner 
of lexical  rules in LFG or metaru les  in GPSG. 
A l though we may consider F i l lmore's  (1968) not ions of 
a case-h ierarchy for subject select ion, or the 
associat ion of preposi t ions with cases to be 
overstated, this is only because he made the mistake 
of posi t ing these as genera l isat ions  rather than 
defaults.  
Of course, Case does introduce new problems, not 
least of which is the def in i t ion of a comfortable 
case set. But this is not a design problem, but a 
development problem, and one would like to bel ieve 
that the appropr iate case d ist inct ions wil l  become 
evident during a period of exper imentat ion with a 
prototype system. Like in any engineer ing (as 
opposed to theoret ical)  undertak ing,  one must be 
prepared for a per iod of flux where the appropr iate 
tools are developed and modif ied.  
It is appropr iate at this point to look br ief ly  at 
the extent to which Case is current ly  used in MT 
systems. Perhaps the most extensive use of Case is 
found in LRC's METAL system (Lehmann et al1980). 
The system is bas ica l ly  t ransfer-based,  with the 
results  of a context - f ree parse of the source text 
passed to the 'case frame processor ' .  Case frames 
are also used Jn transfer.  The cases in the system 
are divided into two types, 'central.' and 
'peripheral ' ,  corresponding roughly to the 
tradit ional  Valency d ist inct ion between complements 
and adjuncts respect ively.  
A key aspect of the METAL concept ion of central  and 
per ipheral  cases is that these form two discrete sets 
of eases. This means that each of the cases that are 
recognized is regarded as either typical ly  
"condit ioned by the part icular  verb" or not verb- 
specif ic.  However,  it is reeognised that "... a few 
classes of verbs may be closely assoc iated with 
arguments which are usual ly  cons idered per ipheral  for 
most verb classes" (Lehmann et al 1980:1-24),  the 
example given being verbs of mot ion which often 
specify a locat ive complement.  
Lexieal  entr ies indicate the range of cases for each 
verb, for each of which three types of 
subcategor izat ion informat ion are given, as follows: 
(a) the '~emantic type' of the argument; (b) its 
canonical  syntactic role (surface case); (c) the 
syntact ic form of the argument, i.e. the kind of 
const i tuent  expected for each argument,  c.g. clause, 
noun-phrase,  prepos i t ional  phrase, adverb. 
In addit ion, verbs are ass igned to a ' transit iv ity 
type'. This feature gives the "potential  
conf igurat ion of arguments",  that is, re lat ing the 
possible ease roles to the canonical  syntact ic roles 
according to the mood and voice of the verb. This 
feature does add informat ion not expressed elsewhere, 
even though at f irst sight it would appear only to 
corroborate t i le correspondence between deep and 
surface caI~e: it is according to t rans i t iv i ty  type 
that rules regarding sentence forms other than simple 
active indicat ive can be general ised.  
In contrast with tradit ional  approaches to Case, note 
that requirements  regard ing semantic and syntact ic 
restr ict ions are not necessar i ly  d irect ly  associated 
with the cases, as was found in F i l lmore's  or iginal 
(1968) proposal,  but can be speci f ied for individual  
verbs, though a system of defaults  does apply. 
The case frame processor attempts to 'use up' the 
avai lable arguments by matching them to the 
speci f icat ions given in the lexical  entry for the 
verb, and then appl ies general  'case functions' 
assoc iated with the per ipheral  cases to the remaining 
arguments.  If all the arguments can be legal ly 
ass igned case roles, then the clause Js considered 
wel l - formed.  Otherwise,  tile rule in deemed to have 
fai led, and an a l ternat ive frame processor  is tried. 
Case frames are also used in transfer,  pr imari ly  to 
order the const i tuents and assign them appropr iate 
syntact ic funct ion markers.  Sometimes, if a case is 
'marked', there might also be a change in syntactic 
form, most often (presumably) from noun-phrase to 
preposi t ional  phrase or vice versa. 
Lack of space prevents us from looking closely at the 
list of cases used. The list of central roles more 
or less ref lects  the consensus view. In addit ion, 
ful ly 25 major  and addit ional  per ipheral  ro\].es of a 
rather less abstract nature are proposed. 
Of interest in the documentat ion descr ib ing the case 
roles Js that some of them are exempl i f ied in noun 
frames rather than verb frames (see below). More 
bizarre perhaps is that although these roles are 
al legedly typical ly  per ipheral ,  many of the examples 
given show them being used as 'obligatory' arguments,  
somewhat undermin ing the centra l -per ipheral  
d ist inct ion.  This leads us to our most important 
comment on the METAL system, with regard to the 
centra l -per iphera l  dist inct ion.  There is a serious 
problem, if we admit the poss ib i l i ty  of using these 
cases also for 'obligatory' roles, of confl ict  
between these more specif ic and the sl ightly more 
general central cases. For example, there is an 
Mater ial  case, as in (10a), which would however also 
seem a good al ternat ive candidate to Target 
(=Patient) for the surface object of use in (iOb). 
(10a) John built the wall out of bricks. 
(10b) John used bricks to bui ld the wall. 
My own proposals wil l  show how this kind of problem 
might be addressed, in part icular  by making a 
str icter d is t inct ion between 'central' and 
'peripheral' cases, though al lowing the latter as 
'secondary' labels attaching to the former where 
necessary. 
6. Valency and Case in MT 
In this sect ion I wish to present a synthesised view 
of the use of Valency and Case in MT, taking into 
account the points raised above. In the fo l lowing 
discussion, I assume a transfer-  rather than 
inter l ingua-based approach, in keeping with current 
views on this dichotomy. 
Remember ing the necess i ty  to keep transfer as small 
as possible, we can see the mot ivat ion for 
introducing the degree of shal low semantics offered 
by Case. We saw in Sect ion 2 the problems associated 
with transfer based solely on labels d ist inguishing 
only between complements and adjuncts.  We have also 
seen in Sect ion 5 how the additional, informat ion 
12t 
carr ied by case labels s impl i f ies the mapping of 
arguments i n  transfer.  We should also take  into 
considerat ion the fact (cf. Somers, in press) that 
all the tradi t ional ly  proposed cases (with the 
except ion of Patient) can occur both as complements 
and adjuncts, even simultaneously.  It seems 
therefore that the key to transfer  is a label 
indicat ing both a case re lat ion and the va lency-  
binding of that element, so that each const i tuent is 
uniquely identi f iable.  We also seek to incorporate 
the addit ional  va lency-b ind ing values (integral, 
middle and extra-per ipheral )  introduced in Sect ion 3. 
For guidance as regards the choice of a set of cases, 
I would l ike to propose an adaptat ion of the approach 
found in METAL (discussed above), where there is a 
strJ.ct d ist inct ion between the cases used for central  
and per ipheral  roles. We saw in our d iscuss ion above 
that some uneasiness results  from the combinat ion of 
general  and specif ic cases, since often both a 
general  (tradit ional) and a specif ic case ass ignment 
seems appropriate.  The approach I wish to propose 
here involves the def in i t ion of a re lat ive ly  small 
set of tradit ional  cases which are assoc iated 
pr imari ly  with complements.  The notion 'relat ively 
small' must of course be expanded. The cases in this 
set wil l  be rather abstract in the manner of 
tradit ional  cases. Because they are to be used 
essent ia l ly  to d ist inguish va lency-bound elements,  
and because the maximum possible valency for any verb 
is probably four, we could argue for having only that 
many of these 'inner cases'. However,  we also want 
to take advantage of the mnemonic value of the case 
names, so as to make assignment of case labels (by 
humans, perhaps in re lat ive ly  independent research 
groups) as easy as possible. The number and exact 
values of these cases is to be f ixed by some 
pre l iminary research, and is not in my v iew an issue 
of import. The important point is that this set be 
fixed, i.e. forming a c losed set, so that one of the 
cases can be used quite expl ic i t ly  as a 'wastebasket' 
or neutral  case (cf. Mellema, 1974) for those 
instances where there is no obvious case assignment.  
Judic ious and mot ivated e laborat ion of the case-set 
wil l  reduce such instances to a minimum. 
A further range of less abstract cases wil l  serve for 
the remaining degrees of va lency-b ind ing - middles,  
adjuncts and extra-per ipherals .  These wil l  typical ly  
be more specif ic,  and their character  determined by 
part icular  t rans lat ion problems as they arise during 
the development stage of the system. Some 
suggest ions of candidates for this l ist can be found 
in the METAL documentat ion.  Given the existence of 
these specif ic cases, it would be quite acceptable  to 
use them as secondary labels in conjunct ion with the 
tradit ional  cases (part icular ly,  perhaps, the neutral  
case), again as and where necessary or helpful,  
though their presence would not typical ly  be a 
requirement for transfer.  They might, for example, 
be found to be of ass istance in choosing appropr iate 
surface structures in generat ion for some target 
language, though not for another. 
There remains the problem of the roles of arguments 
in non-verbal  const i tuents,  since these too have a 
dependency structure. Furthermore,  the recogni t ion 
of the nature of these relatJ.onships is often 
essential  in translat ion.  Compare the noun groups in 
(11), all of which have a s imi lar syntact ic 
structure, but which represent  di f ferent t rans lat ion 
patterns in French, depending on the re lat ionsh ip  
122 
between the modi f ier  and the head. 
(11a) a steam train un train ~ vapeur 
(111)) a footbal l  pitch un terrain de foot 
( l l c )  a cot ton  sh i r t  une  chemise  en  coton  
( l ld )  the  baby  l inen  le  l inge  pour  bSbK 
A l though i t  cou ld  be  argued that  these  noun-phrases  
cou ld  be  t reated  as ind iv idua l  compound lex ica \ ]  
i tems,  the  type  o f  const ruc t ion  they  exempl i fy  is  
typ ica l ,  w idespread ,  and  such  ' compounds '  occur  
freely in novel combinat ions,  often involv ing a 
larger number of elements (12): 
(12a) the Geneva peace talks 
(12b) SDP elect ion campaign promises 
(12c) North Sea oil. f ield of fshore r ig admin is t rat ion 
These pose considerable problems when they are 
translated into languages in which such opaque 
compounds cannot be formed and where the 
re lat ionships between the elements are made more 
explicit .  Therefore,  these re lat ionships must be 
represented at i nput  to transfer.  Indeed this has 
been recognised as a problem in t rans lat ion (human or 
mechanical ) ,  and Case suggested as a descr ipt ive 
mechanism for such structures (e.g. Bauer, 1978; 
Mackenzie,  1983). . My own approach would be to 
propose that the case set be supplemented by a number 
of re lat ions speci f ica l ly  su i ted  to noun groups: 
these would be compat ib le with the cases already 
establ ished, with as large an overlap as possible.  
Clearly, in the case of complex noun groups whose 
head is der ived from a verb, either as a direct 
nominal isat Jon (13a), as a cognate form (14a) or even 
perhaps when the l ink is essent ia l ly  semantic (15a), 
there is no reason why the range of cases (and 
valency bindings) that would apply in the 
corresponding verbal predicat ions (13b, 14b, 15b) 
could not be employed within the noun group. 
(13a) the possib le future dismissal  of teachers for 
incompetence 
(13b) Teachers wil l  possib ly be d ismissed in future 
for incompetence. 
(14a) my mother 's  temporary loss of memory 
(14b) My mother  has temporar i ly  lost her memory. 
(15a) Everton's  recent 6-1 home victory over Arsenal  
(15b) Everton recent ly  beat Arsenal  by 6-1 at home. 
By the same token, nouns not so re lated to verbs must 
be seen as heads with arguments in some relat ion.  
Work on nominal  valency (e.g. Sommerfeldt  & 
Schreiber,  1977; Teubert,  1979) has recognised that 
many nouns can be att r ibuted 'valency patterns' ,  and 
Pi~ha (1980) and Mackenzie  (1983) have taken a Case 
approach to the problem. Among their f indings is the 
observat ion that whi le almost no nouns take 
obl igatory complements,  many noun modi f iers  can be 
regarded as va lency-bound (e .g .  the noun book  has 
complements indicat ing author, subject and contents,  
s ignal led by by, about and of  respect ive ly) .  
Furthermore,  there are a number of case- l ike 
relat ions that are appropr iate for noun modif iers ,  
among them almost certa in ly  an essent ia l ly  nentra\]  
one, for use - in the context of MT - when there 
turns out to be no need to compute the reJat ionship:  
atLr ihut ive adject ives may be an example of this. 
It is not my intent ion here to establ ish,  discuss and 
justify such  a set of rela~.ions. In any case, on ly  
by extensJ ve research and exper imentat ion with a 
working sys t, em could sne expect be be ab\] e to 
discover the range of relat ions needed. 
7. Conc lus ion  
It has been the :intent\]on of th:is paper to nlake a 
s ta tement  about  t i l e  p roper  approach  to  the  use  o f  
case and Va lency  J.n MT. On tile one ha l ld ,  I have  
presented a proposal to abandon the old two-~Jerm 
Valency system ill favour of a new six-term system, 
and have explored the consequences of such a change. 
In connect ion with this, I have tried to show where 
Case fits in. What this research perhaps lacks at 
this point in time is empirical evidence that such an 
approach is valid, and an accompany:ing set of case 
names for the various relations. It could be argued 
that t l le latter is a prerequis i te for the former, 
though I would prefer to claim that the demonstrat ion 
of the val id i ty of the approach and the elaborat ion 
of a 'comfortable' set of cases form an essenl;ially 
un i f : ied  research task. Th is  paper, ellen , has 
explained tile Lheoretica\] background to such a Lask.
