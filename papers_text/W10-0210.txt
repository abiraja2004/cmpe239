Abstract 
The automatic analysis and classification of 
text using fine-grained attitude labels is the 
main task we address in our research. The de-
veloped @AM system relies on compositio-
nality principle and a novel approach based on 
the rules elaborated for semantically distinct 
verb classes. The evaluation of our method on 
1000 sentences, that describe personal expe-
riences, showed promising results: average 
accuracy on fine-grained level was 62%, on 
middle level ? 71%, and on top level ? 88%. 
1 Introduction and Related Work 
With rapidly growing online sources aimed at en-
couraging and stimulating people?s discussions 
concerning personal, public or social issues (news, 
blogs, discussion forums, etc.), there is a great 
need in development of a computational tool for 
the analysis of people?s attitudes. According to the 
Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005), atti-
tude types define the specifics of appraisal being 
expressed: affect (personal emotional state), judg-
ment (social or ethical appraisal of other?s behav-
iour), and appreciation (evaluation of phenomena). 
To analyse contextual sentiment (polarity) of a 
phrase or a sentence, rule-based approaches (Na-
sukawa and Yi, 2003; Mulder et al, 2004; Moila-
nen and Pulman, 2007; Subrahmanian and 
Reforgiato, 2008), a machine-learning method us-
ing not only lexical but also syntactic features 
(Wilson et al, 2005), and a model of integration of 
machine learning approach with compositional 
semantics (Choi and Cardie, 2008) were proposed. 
With the aim to recognize fine-grained emotions 
from text on the level of distinct sentences, re-
searchers have employed a keyword spotting tech-
nique (Olveres et al, 1998; Chuang and Wu, 2004; 
Strapparava et al, 2007), a technique calculating 
emotion scores using Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (PMI) (Kozareva et al, 2007), an approach 
inspired by common-sense knowledge (Liu et al, 
2003), rule-based linguistic approaches (Boucou-
valas, 2003; Chaumartin, 2007), machine-learning 
methods (Alm, 2008; Aman and Szpakowicz, 
2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and an 
ensemble based multi-label classification technique 
(Bhowmick et al, 2009). 
Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude types 
in the task of attitude analysis were made by Ta-
boada and Grieve (2004), who determined a poten-
tial value of adjectives for affect, judgement and 
appreciation by calculating the PMI with the pro-
noun-copular pairs ?I was (affect)?, ?He was 
(judgement)?, and ?It was (appreciation)?, and 
Whitelaw et al (2005), who used machine learning 
technique (SVM) with fine-grained semantic dis-
tinctions in features (attitude type, orientation) in 
combination with ?bag of words? to classify movie 
reviews. However, the concentration only on ad-
jectives, that express appraisal, and their modifiers, 
greatly narrows the potential of the Whitelaw et 
al.?s (2005) approach. 
In this paper we introduce our system @AM 
(ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifies 
80
sentences according to the fine-grained attitude 
labels (nine affect categories (Izard, 1971): ?anger?, 
?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?, ?sadness?, 
?shame?, ?surprise?; four polarity labels for judg-
ment and appreciation: ?POS jud?, ?NEG jud?, 
?POS app?, ?NEG app?; and ?neutral?); (2) assigns 
the strength of the attitude; and (3) determines the 
level of confidence, with which the attitude is ex-
pressed. @AM relies on compositionality principle 
and a novel approach based on the rules elaborated 
for semantically distinct verb classes. 
2 Lexicon for Attitide Analysis 
We built the lexicon for attitude analysis that in-
cludes: (1) attitude-conveying terms; (2) modifiers; 
(3) ?functional? words; and (4) modal operators. 
2.1 The Core of Lexicon 
As a core of lexicon for attitude analysis, we em-
ploy Affect database and extended version of Sen-
tiFul database developed by Neviarouskaya et al 
(2009). The affective features of each emotion-
related word are encoded using nine emotion labels 
(?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?, 
?sadness?, ?shame?, and ?surprise?) and correspond-
ing emotion intensities that range from 0.0 to 1.0. 
The original version of SentiFul database, which 
contains sentiment-conveying adjectives, adverbs, 
nouns, and verbs annotated by sentiment polarity, 
polarity scores and weights, was manually ex-
tended using attitude labels. Some examples of 
annotated attitude-conveying words are listed in 
Table 1. It is important to note here that some 
words could express different attitude types (affect, 
judgment, appreciation) depending on context; 
such lexical entries were annotated by all possible 
categories.

their annotations. 
2.2 Modifiers and Functional Words 
The robust attitude analysis method should rely not 
only on attitude-conveying terms, but also on mod-
ifiers and contextual valence shifters (term intro-
duced by Polanyi and Zaenen (2004)), which are 
integral parts of our lexicon. 
We collected 138 modifiers that have an impact 
on contextual attitude features of related words, 
phrases, or clauses. They include: 
1. Adverbs of degree (e.g., ?significantly?, 
?slightly? etc.) and adverbs of affirmation (e.g., 
?absolutely?, ?seemingly?) that have an influence on 
the strength of attitude of the related words. 
2. Negation words (e.g., ?never?, ?nothing? 
etc.) that reverse the polarity of related statement. 
3. Adverbs of doubt (e.g., ?scarcely?, ?hardly? 
etc.) and adverbs of falseness (e.g., ?wrongly? etc.) 
that reverse the polarity of related statement. 
4. Prepositions (e.g., ?without?, ?despite? etc.) 
that neutralize the attitude of related words. 
5. Condition operators (e.g., ?if?, ?even though? 
etc.) that neutralize the attitude of related words. 
Adverbs of degree and adverbs of affirmation af-
fect on related verbs, adjectives, or another adverb. 
Two annotators gave coefficients for intensity de-
gree strengthening or weakening (from 0.0 to 2.0) 
to each of 112 collected adverbs, and the result was 
averaged (e.g., coeff(?perfectly?) = 1.9, 
coeff(?slightly?) = 0.2). 
We distinguish two types of ?functional? words 
that influence contextual attitude and its strength:  
1. Intensifying adjectives (e.g., ?rising?, ?rap-
idly-growing?), nouns (e.g., ?increase?, ?up-tick?), 
and verbs (e.g., ?to grow?, ?to rocket?), which in-
crease the strength of attitude of related words. 
2. Reversing adjectives (e.g., ?reduced?), nouns 
(e.g., ?termination?, ?reduction?), and verbs (e.g., 
?to decrease?, ?to limit?, ?to diminish?), which re-
verse the prior polarity of related words. 
2.3 Modal Operators 
Consideration of the modal operators in the tasks 
of opinion mining and attitude analysis is very im-
portant, as they indicate a degree of person?s belief 
in the truth of the proposition, which is subjective 
in nature. Modal expressions point to likelihood 
and clearly involve the speaker?s judgment (Hoye, 
1997). Modals are distinguished by the confidence 
level. 
81
We collected modal operators of two categories:  
1. Modal verbs (13 verbs). 
2. Modal adverbs (61 adverbs). 
Three human annotators assigned the confidence 
level, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, to each modal 
verb and adverb; these ratings were averaged (e.g., 
conf(?vaguely?) = 0.17, conf(?may?) = 0.27, 
conf(?arguably?) = 0.63, conf(?would?) = 0.8, 
conf(?veritably?) = 1.0).  
3 Compositionality Principle 
Words in a sentence are interrelated and, hence, 
each of them can influence the overall meaning 
and attitudinal bias of a statement. The algorithm 
for the attitude classification is designed based on 
the compositionality principle, according to which 
we determine the attitudinal meaning of a sentence 
by composing the pieces that correspond to lexical 
units or other linguistic constituent types governed 
by the rules of polarity reversal, aggregation (fu-
sion), propagation, domination, neutralization, and 
intensification, at various grammatical levels. 
Polarity reversal means that phrase or statement 
containing attitude-conveying term/phrase with 
prior positive polarity becomes negative, and vice 
versa. The rule of polarity reversal is applied in 
three cases: (1) negation word-modifier in relation 
with attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?never? & 
POS(?succeed?) => NEG(?never succeed?)); (2) 
adverb of doubt in relation with attitude-conveying 
statement (e.g., ?scarcely? & POS(?relax?) => 
NEG(?scarcely relax?)); (3) functional word of 
reversing type in relation with attitude-conveying 
statement (e.g., adjective ?reduced? & 
POS(?enthusiasm?) => NEG(?reduced enthusi-
asm?)). In the case of judgment and appreciation, 
the use of polarity reversal rule is straightforward 
(?POS jud? <=> ?NEG jud?, ?POS app? <=> ?NEG 
app?). However, it is not trivial to find pairs of op-
posite emotions in the case of a fine-grained classi-
fication, except for ?joy? and ?sadness?. Therefore, 
we assume that (1) opposite emotion for three posi-
tive emotions, such as ?interest?, ?joy?, and ?sur-
prise?, is ?sadness? (?POS aff? => ?sadness?); and 
(2) opposite emotion for six negative emotions, 
such as ?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?sadness?, 
and ?shame?, is ?joy? (?NEG aff? => ?joy?). 
The rules of aggregation (fusion) are as follows: 
(1) if polarities of attitude-conveying terms in ad-
jective-noun, noun-noun, adverb-adjective, adverb-
verb phrases have opposite directions, mixed po-
larity with dominant polarity of a descriptive term 
is assigned to the phrase (e.g., POS(?beautiful?) & 
NEG(?fight?) => POS-neg(?beautiful fight?); 
NEG(?shamelessly?) & POS(?celebrate?) => NEG-
pos(?shamelessly celebrate?)); otherwise (2) the 
resulting polarity is based on the equal polarities of 
terms, and the strength of attitude is measured as a 
maximum between polarity scores (intensities) of 
terms (max(score1,score2)).  
The rule of propagation is useful, as proposed in 
(Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), for the task of detection 
of local sentiments for given subjects. ?Propaga-
tion? verbs propagate the sentiment towards the 
arguments; ?transfer? verbs transmit sentiments 
among the arguments. The rule of propagation is 
applied when verb of ?propagation? or ?transfer? 
type is used in a phrase/clause and sentiment of an 
argument that has prior neutral polarity needs to be 
investigated (e.g., PROP-POS(?to admire?) & ?his 
behaviour? => POS(?his behaviour?); ?Mr. X? & 
TRANS(?supports?) & NEG(?crime business?) => 
NEG(?Mr. X?)).  
The rules of domination are as follows: (1) if po-
larities of verb (this rule is applied only for certain 
classes of verbs) and object in a clause have oppo-
site directions, the polarity of verb is prevailing 
(e.g., NEG(?to deceive?) & POS(?hopes?) => 
NEG(?to deceive hopes?)); (2) if compound sen-
tence joints clauses using coordinate connector 
?but?, the attitude features of a clause following 
after the connector are dominant (e.g., ?NEG(It 
was hard to climb a mountain all night long), but 
POS(a magnificent view rewarded the traveler at 
the morning).? => POS(whole sentence)). 
The rule of neutralization is applied when 
preposition-modifier or condition operator relate to 
the attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?despite? & 
NEG(?worries?) => NEUT(?despite worries?)). 
The rule of intensification means strengthening 
or weakening of the polarity score (intensity), and 
is applied when: 
1. adverb of degree or affirmation relates to at-
titude-conveying term (e.g., Pos_score(?extremely 
happy?) > Pos_score(?happy?)); 
2. adjective or adverb is used in a comparative 
or superlative form (e.g., Neg_score(?sad?) < 
Neg_score(?sadder?) < Neg_score (?saddest?)). 
Our method is capable of processing sentences of 
different complexity, including simple, compound, 
complex (with complement and relative clauses), 
82
and complex-compound sentences. To understand 
how words and concepts relate to each other in a 
sentence, we employ Connexor Machinese Syntax 
parser (http://www.connexor.eu/) that 
returns lemmas, parts of speech, dependency func-
tions, syntactic function tags, and morphological 
tags. When handling the parser output, we repre-
sent the sentence as a set of primitive clauses. Each 
clause might include Subject formation, Verb for-
mation and Object formation, each of which may 
consist of a main element (subject, verb, or object) 
and its attributives and complements. For the 
processing of complex or compound sentences, we 
build a so-called ?relation matrix?, which contains 
information about dependences (e.g., coordination, 
subordination, condition, contingency, etc.) be-
tween different clauses in a sentence. 
The annotations of words are taken from our at-
titude-conveying lexicon. The decision on most 
appropriate label, in case of words with multiple 
annotations (e.g., word ?unfriendly? in Table 1), is 
made based on (1) the analysis of morphological 
tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the 
sentence (e.g., first person pronoun, third person 
pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or 
genitive noun, etc.); (2) the analysis of the se-
quence of hypernymic semantic relations of a par-
ticular noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990), which 
allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g., 
?person, human being?, ?artifact?, ?event?, etc.). 
For ex., ?I feel highly unfriendly attitude towards 
me? conveys ?NEG aff? (?sadness?), while ?Shop 
assistant?s behavior was really unfriendly? and 
?Plastic bags are environment unfriendly? express 
?NEG jud? and ?NEG app?, correspondingly. 
While applying the compositionality principle, 
we consecutively assign attitude features to words, 
phrases, formations, clauses, and finally, to the 
whole sentence. 
4 Consideration of the Semantics of Verbs 
All sentences must include a verb, because the 
verb tells us what action the subject is performing 
and object is receiving. In order to elaborate rules 
for attitude analysis based on the semantics of 
verbs, we investigated VerbNet (Kipper et al, 
2007), the largest on-line verb lexicon that is orga-
nized into verb classes characterized by syntactic 
and semantic coherence among members of a 
class. Based on the thorough analysis of 270 first-
level classes of VerbNet and their members, 73 
verb classes (1) were found useful for the task of 
attitude analysis, and (2) were further classified 
into 22 classes differentiated by the role that mem-
bers play in attitude analysis and by rules applied 
to them. Our classification is shown in Table 2. 
 
Verb class (verb samples) 
1 Psychological state or emotional reaction 
1.1 Object-centered (oriented) emotional state (adore, re-
gret) 
1.2 Subject-driven change in emotional state (trans.)
(charm, inspire, bother) 
1.3 Subject-driven change in emotional state (intrans.) (ap-
peal to, grate on) 
2 Judgment 
2.1 Positive judgment (bless, honor) 
2.2 Negative judgment (blame, punish) 
3 Favorable attitude (accept, allow, tolerate) 
4 Adverse (unfavorable) attitude (discourage, elude, forbid) 
5 Favorable or adverse calibratable changes of state (grow, 
decline) 
6 Verbs of removing 
6.1 Verbs of removing with neutral charge (delete, remove)
6.2 Verbs of removing with negative charge (deport, expel)
6.3 Verbs of removing with positive charge (evacuate, 
cure) 
7 Negatively charged change of state (break, crush, smash) 
8 Bodily state and damage to the body (sicken, injure) 
9 Aspectual verbs 
9.1 Initiation, continuation of activity, and sustaining (be-
gin, continue, maintain) 
9.2 Termination of activity (quit, finish) 
10 Preservation (defend, insure) 
11 Verbs of destruction and killing (damage, poison) 
12 Disappearance (disappear, die) 
13 Limitation and subjugation (confine, restrict) 
14 Assistance (succor, help) 
15 Obtaining (win, earn) 
16 Communication indicator/reinforcement of attitude (guess, 
complain, deny) 
17 Verbs of leaving (abandon, desert) 
18 Changes in social status or condition (canonize, widow) 
19 Success and failure 
19.1 Success (succeed, manage) 
19.2 Failure (fail, flub) 
20 Emotional nonverbal expression (smile, weep) 
21 Social interaction (marry, divorce) 
22 Transmitting verbs (supply, provide) 
Table 2. Verb classes defined for attitude analysis. 
 
For each of our verb classes, we developed set 
of rules that are applied to attitude analysis on the 
phrase/clause-level. Some verb classes include 
verbs annotated by attitude type, prior polarity 
orientation, and the strength of attitude: ?Psycho-
logical state or emotional reaction?, ?Judgment?, 
?Verbs of removing with negative charge?, ?Verbs 
83
of removing with positive charge?, ?Negatively 
charged change of state?, ?Bodily state and dam-
age to the body?, ?Preservation?, and others. The 
attitude features of phrases, which involve posi-
tively or negatively charged verbs from such 
classes, are context-sensitive, and are defined by 
means of rules designed for each of the class. 
As an example, below we provide short descrip-
tion and rules elaborated for the subclass ?Object-
centered (oriented) emotional state?. 
Features: subject experiences emotions towards 
some stimulus; verb prior polarity: positive or neg-
ative; context-sensitive. 
Verb-Object rules (subject is ignored): 
1. ?Interior perspective? (subject?s inner emotion 
state or attitude): 
S & V+(?admires?) & O+(?his brave heart?) => 
(fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?POS aff?. 
S & V+(?admires?) & O-(?mafia leader?) => 
(verb valence dominance, V_score) => ?POS aff?. 
S & V-(?disdains?) & O+(?his honesty?) => 
(verb valence dominance, V_score) => ?NEG aff?. 
S & V-(?disdains?) & O-(?criminal activities?) 
=> (fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?NEG aff?. 
2. ?Exterior perspective? (social/ethical judgment): 
S & V+(?admires?) & O+(?his brave heart?) => 
(fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?POS jud?. 
S & V+(?admires?) & O-(?mafia leader?) => 
(verb valence reversal, max(V_score,O_score)) => 
?NEG jud?. 
S & V-(?disdains?) & O+(?his honesty?) => 
(verb valence dominance, max(V_score,O_score)) 
=> ?NEG jud?. 
S & V-(?disdains?) & O-(?criminal activities?) 
=> (verb valence reversal, max(V_score,O_score)) 
=> ?POS jud?. 
3. In case of neutral object => attitude type and 
prior polarity of verb, verb score (V_score). 
Verb-PP (prepositional phrase) rules: 
1. In case of negatively charged verb and PP start-
ing with ?from? => verb valence dominance:  
S & V-(?suffers?) & PP-(?from illness?) => inte-
rior: ?NEG aff?; exterior: ?NEG jud?. 
S & V-(?suffers?) & PP+ (?from love?) => inte-
rior: ?NEG aff?; exterior: ?NEG jud?. 
2. In case of positively charged verb and PP start-
ing with ?in?/?for?, treat PP same as object (see 
above): 
S & V+(?believes?) & PP-(?in evil?) => interior: 
?POS aff?; exterior: ?NEG jud?. 
S & V+(?believes?) & PP+(?in kindness?) => in-
terior: ?POS aff?; exterior: ?POS jud?. 
In the majority of rules the strength of attitude is 
measured as a maximum between attitude scores of 
a verb and an object (max(V_score,O_score)), be-
cause strength of overall attitude depends on both 
scores. For example, attitude conveyed by ?to suf-
fer from grave illness? is stronger than that of ?to 
suffer from slight illness?. 
In contrast to the rules of ?Object-centered 
(oriented) emotional state? subclass, which ignore 
attitude features of a subject in a sentence, the rules 
elaborated for the ?Subject-driven change in emo-
tional state (trans.)? disregard the attitude features 
of object, as in sentences involving members of 
this subclass object experiences emotion, and sub-
ject causes the emotional state. For example (due 
to limitation of space, here and below we provide 
only some cases): 
S(?Classical music?) & V+(?calmed?) & O-
(?disobedient child?) => interior: ?POS aff?; exte-
rior: ?POS app?. 
S-(?Fatal consequences of GM food intake?) & 
V-(?frighten?) & O(?me?) => interior: ?NEG aff?; 
exterior: ?NEG app?. 
The Verb-Object rules for the subclasses ?Positive 
judgment? and ?Negative judgment? (verbs from 
?Judgment? class relate to a judgment or opinion 
that someone may have in reaction to something) 
are very close to those defined for the subclass 
?Object-centered (oriented) emotional state?. 
However, Verb-PP rules have some specifics: for 
both positive and negative judgment verbs, we 
treat PP starting with ?for?/?of?/?as? same as object 
in Verb-Object rules. For example: 
S(?He?) & V-(?blamed?) & O+(?innocent per-
son?) => interior: ?NEG jud?; exterior: ?NEG jud?. 
S(?They?) & V-(?punished?) & O(?him?) & PP-
(?for his misdeed?) => interior: ?NEG jud?; exte-
rior: ?POS jud?. 
Verbs from classes ?Favorable attitude? and ?Ad-
verse (unfavorable) attitude? have prior neutral 
polarity and positive or negative reinforcement, 
correspondingly, that means that they only impact 
on the polarity and strength of non-neutral phrase 
(object in a sentence written in active voice, or 
subject in a sentence written in passive voice, or 
PP in case of some verbs).  
Rules: 
1. If verb belongs to the ?Favorable attitude? class 
and the polarity of phrase is not neutral, then the 
84
attitude score of the phrase is intensified (we use 
symbol ?^? to indicate intensification): 
S(?They?) & [V pos. reinforcement](?elected?) & 
O+(?fair judge?) => ?POS app?; O_score^. 
S(?They?) & [V pos. reinforcement](?elected?) & 
O-(?corrupt candidate?) => ?NEG app?; O_score^. 
2. If verb belongs to the ?Adverse (unfavorable) 
attitude? class and the polarity of phrase is not neu-
tral, then the polarity of phrase is reversed and 
score is intensified: 
S(?They?) & [V neg. reinforcement](?prevented?) 
& O-(?the spread of disease?) => ?POS app?; 
O_score^. 
S+(?His achievements?) & [V neg. reinforce-
ment](?were overstated?) => ?NEG app?; S_score^. 
Below are examples of processing the sentences 
with verbs from ?Verbs of removing? class. 
?Verbs of removing with neutral charge?: 
S(?The tape-recorder?) & [V neutral 
rem.](?automatically ejects?) & O-neutral(?the 
tape?) => neutral. 
S(?The safety invention?) & [V neutral 
rem.](?ejected?) & O(?the pilot?) & PP-(?from 
burning plane?) => ?POS app?; PP_score^. 
?Verbs of removing with negative charge?: 
S(?Manager?) & [V neg. rem.](?fired?) & O-
(?careless employee?) & PP(?from the company?) 
=> ?POS app?; max(V_score,O_score).  
?Verbs of removing with positive charge?: 
S(?They?) & [V pos. rem.](?evacuated?) & 
O(?children?) & PP-(?from dangerous place?) => 
?POS app?; max(V_score,PP_score). 
Along with modal verbs and modal adverbs, mem-
bers of the ?Communication indica-
tor/reinforcement of attitude? verb class also 
indicate the confidence level or degree of certainty 
concerning given opinion.  
Features: subject (communicator) expresses state-
ment with/without attitude; statement is PP starting 
with ?of?, ?on?, ?against?, ?about?, ?concerning?, 
?regarding?, ?that?, ?how? etc.; ground: positive or 
negative; reinforcement: positive or negative. 
Rules: 
1. If the polarity of expressed statement is neutral, 
then the attitude is neutral: 
S(?Professor?) & [V pos. ground, pos. rein-
forcement, confidence:0.83](?dwelled?) & PP-
neutral(?on a question?) => neutral. 
2. If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-
tral and the reinforcement is positive, then the po-
larity score of the statement (PP) is intensified: 
S(?Jane?) & [V neg. ground, pos. reinforcement, 
confidence:0.8](?is complaining?) & PP-(?of a 
headache again?) => ?NEG app?; PP_score^; con-
fidence:0.8. 
3. If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-
tral and reinforcement is negative, then the polarity 
of the statement (PP) is reversed and score is inten-
sified: 
S(?Max?) & [V neg. ground, neg. reinforcement, 
confidence:0.2](?doubt?) & PP-{?that? S+(?his 
good fortune?) & [V termination](?will ever end?)} 
=> ?POS app?; PP_score^; confidence:0.2.  
In the last example, to measure the sentiment of 
PP, we apply rule for the verb ?end? from the 
?Termination of activity? class, which reverses the 
non-neutral polarity of subject (in intransitive use 
of verb) or object (in transitive use of verb). For 
example, the polarity of the following sentence 
with positive PP is negative: ?They discontinued 
helping children?. 
5 Evaluation 
In order to evaluate the performance of our algo-
rithm, we conducted experiment on the set of sen-
tences extracted from personal stories about life 
experiences that were anonymously published on 
the social networking website Experience Project 
(www.experienceproject.com). This web-
site represents an interactive platform that allows 
people to share personal experiences, thoughts, 
opinions, feelings, passions, and confessions 
through the network of personal stories. With over 
4 million experiences accumulated (as of February 
2010), Experience Project is a perfect source for 
researchers interested in studying different types of 
attitude expressed through text. 
5.1 Data Set Description 
For our experiment we extracted 1000 sentences 
from various stories grouped by topics within 13 
different categories, such as ?Arts and entertain-
ment?, ?Current events?, ?Education?, ?Family and 
friends?, ?Health and wellness?, ?Relationships 
and romance? and others, on the Experience 
Project. Sentences were collected from 358 dis-
tinct topic groups, such as ?I still remember Sep-

We considered three hierarchical levels of atti-
tude labels in our experiment (see Figure 1). Three 
independent annotators labeled the sentences with 
one of 14 categories from ALL level and a corres-
ponding score (the strength or intensity value). 
These annotations were further interpreted using 
labels from MID and TOP levels. Fleiss? Kappa 
coefficient was used as a measure of reliability of 
human raters? annotations. The agreement coeffi-
cient on 1000 sentences was 0.53 on ALL level, 
0.57 on MID level, and 0.73 on TOP level. 
Only those sentences, on which at least two out 
of three human raters completely agreed, were in-
cluded in the ?gold standard? for our experiment. 
Three ?gold standards? were created according to 
the hierarchy of attitude labels. Fleiss? Kappa coef-
ficients are 0.62, 0.63, and 0.74 on ALL, MID, and 
TOP levels, correspondingly. Table 3 shows the 
distributions of labels in the ?gold standards?.

5.2 Results 
After processing each sentence from the data set by 
our system, we measured averaged accuracy, pre-
cision, recall, and F-score for each label within 
ALL, MID, and TOP levels. The results are shown 
in Table 4. The ratio of the most frequent attitude 
label in the ?gold standard? was considered as the 
baseline. As seen from the obtained results, our 
algorithm performed with high accuracy signifi-
cantly surpassing the baselines on all levels of atti-
tude hierarchy (except ?neutral? category on the 
TOP level, which is probably due to the unbal-
anced distribution of labels in the ?gold standard?, 
where ?neutral? sentences constitute less than 9%).

and ?joy? (0.905) emotions at the cost of low preci-
sion (0.528 and 0.439, correspondingly). The algo-
rithm performed with the worst results in 
recognition of ?NEG app? and ?neutral?. 
The analysis of a confusion matrix for the ALL 
level revealed the following top confusions of our 
system (see Table 5): (1) ?anger?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, 
?shame?, ?NEG jud?, ?NEG app? and ?neutral? were 
predominantly incorrectly predicted as ?sadness? 
(for ex., @AM resulted in ?sadness? for the sen-
tence ?I know we have several months left before 
the election, but I am already sick and tired of see-
ing the ads on TV?, while human annotations were 
?anger?/?anger?/?disgust?); (2) ?interest?, ?POS jud? 
and ?POS app? were mostly confused with ?joy? by 
our algorithm (e.g., @AM classified the sentence 
?It?s one of those life changing artifacts that we 
must have in order to have happier, healthier lives? 
as ?joy?(-ful), while human annotations were ?POS 
app?/?POS app?/?interest?).

Table 5. Data from a confusion matrix for ALL level. 
 
Our system achieved high precision for all cate-
gories on the MID level (Table 4), with the excep-
tion of ?NEG app? and ?neutral?, although high 
recall was obtained only in the case of categories 
related to affect (?POS aff?, ?NEG aff?). These re-
sults indicate that affect sensing is easier than rec-
ognition of judgment or appreciation from text. 
TOP level results (Table 4) show that our algo-
rithm classifies sentences that convey positive or 
negative sentiment with high accuracy (92% and 
91%, correspondingly). On the other hand, ?neu-
tral? sentences still pose a challenge. 
The analysis of errors revealed that system re-
quires common sense or additional context to deal 
with sentences like ?All through my life I?ve felt 
like I?m second fiddle? (?gold standard?: ?sadness?; 
@AM: ?neutral?) or ?For me every minute on my 
horse is alike an hour in heaven!? (?gold stan-
dard?: ?joy?; @AM: ?neutral?).  
We also evaluated the system performance with 
regard to attitude intensity estimation. The percen-
tage of attitude-conveying sentences (not consider-
ing neutral ones), on which the result of our system 
conformed to the fine-grained ?gold standard? 
(ALL level), according to the measured distance 
between intensities given by human raters (aver-
aged values) and those obtained by our system is 
shown in Table 6. As seen from the table, our sys-
tem achieved satisfactory results in estimation of 
the strength of attitude expressed through text.

6 Conclusions 
In this paper we introduced @AM, which is so far, 
to the best of our knowledge, the only system clas-
sifying sentences using fine-grained attitude types, 
and extensively dealing with the semantics of 
verbs in attitude analysis. Our composition ap-
proach broadens the coverage of sentences with 
complex contextual attitude. The evaluation results 
indicate that @AM achieved reliable results in the 
task of textual attitude analysis. The limitations 
include dependency on lexicon and on accuracy of 
the parser. The primary objective for the future 
research is to use the results of named-entity rec-
ognition software in our algorithm.
