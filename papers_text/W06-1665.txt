Abstract 
Co-occurrence analysis has been used to 
determine related words or terms in many 
NLP-related applications such as query 
expansion in Information Retrieval (IR). 
However, related words are usually 
determined with respect to a single word, 
without relevant information for its 
application context. For example, the word 
?programming? may be considered to be 
strongly related to ?Java?, and applied 
inappropriately to expand a query on ?Java 
travel?. To solve this problem, we propose 
to add another context word in the relation 
to specify the appropriate context of the 
relation, leading to term relations of the 
form ?(Java, travel) ? Indonesia?. The 
extracted relations are used for query 
expansion in IR. Our experiments on 
several TREC collections show that this 
new type of context-dependent relations 
performs much better than the traditional 
co-occurrence relations.  
1. Introduction 
A query usually is a poor expression of an 
information need. This is not only due to its short 
length (usually a few words), but also due to the 
inability of users to provide the best terms to 
describe their information need. At best, one can 
expect that some, but not all, relevant terms are 
used in the query. Query expansion thus aims to 
improve query expression by adding related 
terms to the query. However, the effect of query 
expansion is strongly determined by the term 
relations used (Peat and Willett, 1991). For 
example, even if ?programming? is strongly 
related to ?Java?, if this relation is used to 
expand a query on ?Java travel?, the retrieval 
result will likely deteriorate because the 
irrelevant term ?programming? is introduced, 
leading to the retrieval of irrelevant documents 
about ?programming?.  
    A number of attempts have been made to deal 
with the problem of selecting appropriate 
expansion terms. For example, Wordnet has been 
used in (Voorhees, 1994) to determine the 
expansion terms. However, the experiments did 
not show improvement on retrieval effectiveness. 
Many experiments have been carried out using 
associative relations extracted from term co-
occurrences; but they showed variable results 
(Peat and Willett, 1991). In (Qiu and Frei, 1993), 
it is observed that one of the reasons is that one 
tried to determine expansion terms according to 
each original query term separately, which may 
introduce much noise. Therefore, they proposed 
to determine the expansion terms by summing up 
the relations of a candidate expansion term to 
each of the query terms. In so doing, a candidate 
expansion term is preferred if it has a strong 
relationship with many of the query terms. 
However, it is still difficult to prevent the 
expansion process from adding ?programming? 
to a query on ?Java travel? because of its very 
strong relation with ?Java?. 
The approach used in (Qiu and Frei, 1993) 
indeed tries to correct a handicap inherent in the 
relations: as term relations are created between 
two single words such as ?Java ? 
programming?, no information is available to 
help determine the appropriate context to apply 
it. The approach used in (Qiu and Frei, 1993) can 
simply alleviate the problem without solving it 
radically. 
    In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in 
the relations themselves. They have to contain 
more information to help determine the 
appropriate context to apply them. We thus 
propose a way to add some context information 
into the relations: we introduce an additional 
word into the condition part of the relation, such 
as ?(Java, computer) ? programming?, which 
551
 means ?programming? is related to ?(Java, 
computer)? together. In so doing, we would be 
able to prevent from extracting and applying a 
relation such as ?(Java, travel) ? 
programming?.  
    In this paper, we will test the extracted 
relations in query expansion for IR. We choose to 
implement query expansion within the language 
modeling (LM) framework because of its 
flexibility and high performance. The 
experiments on several TREC collections will 
show that our query expansion approach can 
bring large improvements in retrieval 
effectiveness. 
    In the following sections, we will first review 
some of the relevant approaches on query 
expansion and term relation extraction. Then we 
will describe our general IR models and the 
extraction of term relations. The experimental 
results will be reported and finally some 
conclusions will be drawn. 
2. Query Expansion and Term Relations 
It has been found that a key factor that 
determines the effect of query expansion is the 
selection of appropriate expansion terms (Peat 
and Willett, 1991). To determine expansion 
terms, one possible resource is thesauri 
constructed manually, such as Wordnet. Thesauri 
contain manually validated relations between 
terms, which can be used to suggest related 
terms. (Voorhees, 1994) carried out a series of 
experiments on selecting related terms (e.g. 
synonyms, hyonyms, etc.) from Wordnet. 
However, the experiments did not show that this 
can improve retrieval effectiveness. Some of the 
reasons are as follows: Although Wordnet 
contains many relations validated by human 
experts, the coverage is far from complete for the 
purposes of IR: not only linguistically motivated 
relations, but also association relations, are useful 
in IR. Another problem is the lack of information 
about the appropriate context to apply relations. 
For example, Wordnet contains two synsets for 
?computer?, one for the sense of ?machine? and 
another for ?human expert?. It is difficult to 
automatically select the correct synset to expand 
the word ?computer? even if we know that the 
query?s area is computer science. 
Another often used resource is associative 
relations extracted from co-occurrences: two 
terms that co-occur frequently are thought to be 
associated to each other (Jing and Croft, 1994). 
However, co-occurrence relations are noisy: 
Frequently co-occurring terms are not necessarily 
related. On the other hand, they can also miss 
true relations. The most important problem is still 
that of ambiguity: when one term is associated 
with another, it may be related for one sense and 
not for other possible senses. It is then difficult to 
determine when the relation applies. 
In most of the previous studies, relations 
extracted are restricted between one word and 
another. This limitation makes the relations 
ambiguous, and their utilization in query 
expansion often introduces undesired terms. We 
believe that the key to make a relation less 
ambiguous is to add some contextual 
information. 
In an attempt to select better expansion terms, 
(Qiu and Frei, 1993) proposed the following 
approach to select expansion terms: terms are 
selected according to their relation to the whole 
query, which is calculated as the sum of their 
relations to each of the query terms. Therefore, a 
term that is related to several query terms will be 
favored. In a similar vein, (Bai et al 2005) also 
try to determine the relationship of a word to a 
group of words by combining its relationships to 
each of the words in the group. This can indeed 
select better expansion terms. The consideration 
of other query terms produces a weak contextual 
effect. However, this effect is limited due to the 
nature of the relations extracted, in which a term 
depends on only one other term. Much of the 
noise in the sets will remain after selection.  
For a query composed of several words, what 
we would really like to have is a set of terms that 
are related to all the words taken together (and 
not separately). By combining words in the 
condition part such as ?(Java, travel)? or ?(base, 
bat)?, each word will serve as a context to the 
other in order to constrain the related terms. In 
these cases, we would expect that ?hotel?, 
?island? or ?Indonesia? would co-occur much 
more often with ?(Java, travel)? than 
?programming?, and ?ball?, ?catcher? etc. co-
occur much more often with ?(base, bat)? than 
?animal? or ?foundation?. 
One naturally would suggest that compound 
terms can be used for this purpose. However, for 
many queries, it is difficult to form a legitimate 
compound term. Even if we can detect one 
occurrence of a compound, we may miss others 
that use its variants. For example, if ?Java travel? 
is used as a query, we will likely be able to 
consider it as a compound term. The same 
compound (or its variant) would be difficult to 
552
 detect in a document talking about traveling to 
Java: the two words may appear at some distance 
or not in some specific syntactic structure as 
required in (Lin, 1997). This will lead to the 
problem of mismatching between document and 
query. 
In fact, compound terms are not the only way 
to add contextual information to a word. By 
putting two words together (without forming a 
compound term), we usually obtain a more 
precise sense for each word. For example, from 
?Java travel?, we can guess that the intended 
meaning is likely related to ?traveling to Java 
Island?. People will not interpret this 
combination in the sense of ?Java 
programming?. In the same way, people would 
not consider ?animal? to be a related term to 
?base, bat?. These examples show that in a 
combination of words, each word indeed serves 
to specify a context to interpret another word. It 
then suggests the following approach: we can 
adjunct some additional word(s) in the condition 
part of a relation, such as ?(Java, travel) ? 
Indonesia?, which means ?Indonesia? is related 
to ?(Java, travel)? together. It is expected that 
one would not obtain ?(Java, travel) ? 
programming?. 
Owing to the context effect explained above, 
we will call the relations with multiple words in 
the condition part context-dependent relations. In 
order to limit the computation complexity, we 
will only consider adding one additional word 
into relations.  
The proposed approach follows the same 
principle as (Yarowsky, 1995), which tried to 
determine the appropriate word sense according 
to one relevant context word. However, the 
requirement for query expansion is less than 
word sense disambiguation: we do not need to 
know the exact word sense to make expansion. 
We only need to determine the relevant 
expansion terms. Therefore, there is no need to 
determine manually a set of seeds before the 
learning process takes place. 
To some extent, the proposed approach is also 
related to (Sch?tze and Pedersen, 1997), which 
calculate term similarity according to the words 
appearing in the same context, or to second-order 
co-occurrences. However, a key difference is that 
(Sch?tze and Pedersen, 1997) consider only 
separate context words, while we consider 
multiple context words together. 
Once term relations are determined, they will 
be used in query expansion. The basic IR process 
will be implemented in a language modeling 
framework. This framework is chosen for its 
flexibility to integrate term relations. Indeed, the 
LM framework has proven to be capable of 
integrating term relations and query expansion 
(Bai et al, 2005; Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Zhai 
and Lafferty, 2001). However, none of the above 
studies has investigated the extraction of strong 
context-dependent relations from text collections. 
In the next section, we will describe the 
general LM framework and our query expansion 
models. Then the extraction of term relation will 
be explained. 
3. Context-Dependent Query Expansion 
in Language Models 
The basic IR approach based on LM (Ponte and 
Croft, 1998) determines the score of relevance of 
a document D by its probability to generate the 
query Q. By assuming independence between 
query terms, we have: 
??
??
?=
Qw
i
Qw
i
ii
DwPDwPDQP )|(log)|()|(  
where )|( DwP i denotes the probability of a word 
in the language model of the document D. As no 
ambiguity will arise, we will use D to mean both 
the language model of the document and the 
document itself (similarly for a query model and 
a query Q). 
Another score function is based on KL-
divergence or cross entropy between the 
document model and the query model: 
?
?
=
Vw
ii
i
DwPQwPQDscore )|(log)|(),(
 
where V is the vocabulary. Although we have 
both document and query models in the above 
formulation, usually only the document model is 
smoothed, while the query model uses Maximum 
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) )|( QwP iML . Then 
we have: 
?
?
=
Qw
iiML
i
DwPQwPQDscore )|(log)|(),(  
However, it is obvious that a distance (KL-
divergence) measured between a short query of a 
few words and a document cannot be precise. A 
better expression would contain all the related 
terms. The construction of a better query 
expression is the very motivation for query 
expansion in traditional IR systems. It is the same 
in LM for IR: to create a better query expression 
(model) to be able to measure the distance to a 
553
 document in a more precise way. The key to 
creating the new model is the integration of term 
relations. 
3.1 LM for Query Expansion 
Term relations have been used in several recent 
language models in IR. (Berger and Lafferty, 
1999) proposed a translation model that expands 
the document model. The same approach can also 
be used to expand the query model. Following 
(Berger and Lafferty, 1999), we arrive at the first 
expansion model as follows, which has also been 
used in (Bai et al, 2005): 
Model 1: Context-independent query 
expansion model (CIQE) 
??
??
==
Qq
jMLjiR
Vq
jiRiR
jj
QqPqwPQqwPQwP )|()|()|,()|(  
In this model, each original query term qj is 
expanded by related terms wi. The relations 
between them are determined by )|( jiR qwP . We 
will explain how this probability is defined in 
Section 3.2. However, we can already see here 
that wi is determined solely by one of the query 
term qj. So, we call this model ?context-
independent query expansion model? (CIQE). 
The above expanded query model enables us 
to obtain new related expansion terms, to which 
we also have to add the original query. This can 
be obtained through the following smoothing: 
?

)|()|(
1
1
?
?
      (1) 
where 1? is a smoothing parameter. 
However, if the query model is expanded on 
all the vocabulary (V), the query evaluation will 
be very time consuming because the query and 
the document have to be compared on every word 
(dimension). In practice, we observe that only a 
small number of terms have strong relations with 
a given term, and the terms having weak relations 
usually are not truly related. So we can limit the 
expansion terms only to the strongly related ones. 
By doing this, we can also expect to filter out 
some noise and considerably reduce the retrieval 
time. 
Suppose that we have selected a set E of 
strong expansion terms. Then we have: 
?

i
DwPQwP
DwPQwPQDscore
)|(log)|(                    
)|(log)|(),(
 
This query expansion method uses the same 
principle as (Qiu and Frei, 1993), but in a LM 
setting: the selected expansion terms are those 
that are strongly related to all the query terms 
(this is what the summation means). The 
approach used in (Bai et al, 2005) is slightly 
different: A context vector is first built for each 
word; then a context vector for a group of words 
(e.g. a multi-word query) is composed from the 
context vectors of the words of the group; finally 
related terms to the group of words are 
determined according to the similarity of their 
context vectors to that of the group. This last step 
uses second-order co-occurrences similarly to 
(Sch?tze and Pedersen, 1997). In both (Qiu and 
Frei, 1993) and (Bai et al, 2005), the terms 
related to a group of words are determined from 
their relations to each of the words in the group, 
while the latter relations are extracted separately. 
Irrelevant expansion terms can be retained. 
As we showed earlier, in many cases, when 
one additional word is used with another word, 
the sense of each of them can usually be better 
determined. This additional word may be 
sufficient to interpret correctly many multi-word 
user queries. Therefore, our goal is to extract 
stronger context-dependent relations of the form 
(qj qk) ? wi, or to build a probability 
function )|( kjiR qqwP . Once this function is 
determined, it can be integrated into a new 
language model as follows.

As )|( kjiR qqwP  is a relation with two terms as 
condition, we will also call it a biterm relation. 
The name ?biterm? is due to (Srikanth and 
Srihari, 2002), which means two terms co-
occurring within some distance. Similarly, 
)|( jiR qwP  will be called unigram relation. The 
corresponding query models will be called biterm 
relation model and unigram relation model.  
As in general LM, the biterm relation model 
can be smoothed with a unigram model. Then we 
have the following score function:

 where 2?  is another smoothing parameter. 
3.2 Extraction of Term Relations 
The key problem now is to obtain the relations 
we need: )|( jiR wwP  and )|( kjiR wwwP . For the first 
probability, as in many previous studies, we 
exploit term co-occurrences. )|( jiR wwP  could be 
built as a traditional bigram model. However, this 
is not a good approach for IR because two related 
terms do not necessarily co-occur side by side. 
They often appear at some distance. Therefore, 
this model is indeed a biterm model (Srikanth 
and Srihari, 2002), i.e., we allow two terms be 
separated within some distance. We use the 
following formula to determine this probability: 
?=
lw
jl
ji
jiR
wwc
wwc
wwP
),(
),()|(  
where ),( ji wwc  is the frequency of co-occurrence 
of the biterm ),( ji ww , i.e. two terms in the same 
window of fixed size across the collection. In our 
case, we set the window size at 10 (because this 
size turned out to be reasonable in our pilot 
experiments). 
For )|( kji wwwP , we further extend the biterm 
to triterm, and we use the frequency of co-
occurrences of three terms ),,( kji wwwc  within the 
same windows in the document collection: 
?=
lw
kjl
kji
kjiR
wwwc
wwwc
wwwP
),,(
),,()|(  
The number of relations determined in this 
way can be very large. The upper bound for 
)|( ji wwP  and )|( kji wwwP  are respectively 
O(|V|2) and O(|V|3). However, many relations 
have very low probabilities and are often noise. 
As we only consider a subset of strong expansion 
terms, the relations with low probability are 
almost never used. Therefore, we set two filtering 
criteria: 
? The biterm in the condition of a relation should 
be higher than a threshold (10 in our case); 
? The probability of a relation should be higher 
than another threshold (0.0001 in our case). 
? One more filtering criterion is mutual 
information (MI), which reflects the 
relatedness of two terms in their combination 
),( kj ww . To keep a relation )|( kji wwwP , we 
require ),( kj ww  be a meaningful combination. 
We use the following pointwise MI (Church 
and Hanks 1989): 
)()(
),(
log),(
kj
kj
kj
wPwP
wwP
wwMI =  
 We only keep meaningful combinations such 
that 0),( >kj wwMI .  
By these filtering criteria, we are able to 
reduce considerably the number of biterms and 
triterms. For example, on a collection of about 
200MB, with a vocabulary size of about 148K, 
we selected only about 2.7M useful biterms and 
about 137M triterms, which remain tractable. 
3.3 Probability of Biterms 
In LM used in IR, each query term is attributed 
the same weight. This is equivalent to a uniform 
probability distribution, i.e.: 
U
i QQqP ||
1)|( =  
where |Q|U is the number of unigrams in the 
query. In CIQE model, we use the same method.  
In CDQE, we also need to attribute a 
probability )|( QqqP kj , to the biterm ),( kj qq . 
Several options are possible. 
Uniform probability 
This simple approach distributes the probability 
uniformly among all biterms in the query, i.e.: 
B
kj QQqqP ||
1)|( =  
where BQ ||  is the number of biterms in Q.  
According to mutual information 
In a query, if two words are strongly associated, 
this also means that their association is more 
meaningful to the query, thus should be weighted 
higher. Therefore, a natural way to assign a 
probability to a biterm in the query is to use 
mutual information, which denotes the strength 
of association between two words. We use again 
the pointwise mutual information MI(qj, qk). If it 
is negative, we consider that the biterm is not 
meaningful, and is ignored. Therefore, we arrive 
at the following probability function: 
?
?
=
Qqq
ml
kj
kj
ml
qqMI
qqMIQqqP
)(
),(
),()|(  
where Qqq ml ?)(  means all the meaningful 
biterms in the query.  
555
 Statistical parsing 
In (Gao et al, 2002), a statistical parsing 
approach is used to determine the best 
combination of translation words for a query. The 
approach is similar to building a minimal 
spanning tree, which is also used in (Smeaton and 
Van Rijsbergen, 1983), to select the strongest 
term relations that cover the whole query. This 
approach can also be used in our model to 
determine the minimal set of the strongest 
biterms that cover the query.  
In our experiments, we tested all the three 
weighting schemas. It turns out that the best 
weighting is the one with MI. Therefore, in the 
next section, we will only report the results with 
the second option. 
4. Experimental Evaluation 
We evaluate query expansion with different 
relations on four TREC collections, which are 
described in Table 1. All documents have been 
processed in a standard manner: terms are 
stemmed using Porter stemmer and stopwords are 
removed. We only use titles of topics as queries, 
which contain 3.58 words per query on average.

In our experiments, the document model 
remains the same while the query model changes. 
The document model uses the following Dirichlet

Dirichlet prior, which is set at 1000 following 
(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).  
There are two other smoothing parameters 1? , 
and 2?  to be determined. In our experiments, we 
use a simple method to set them: the parameters 
are tuned empirically using a training collection 
containing AP1989 documents and queries 101-
150. These preliminary tests suggest that the best 
value of 1?  and 2?  (in Equations 1-2) are 
relatively stable (we will show this later). In the 
experiments reported below, we will use 4.01 =? ,  
and 3.02 =? . 
4.1 Experimental Results 
The main experimental results are described in 
Table 2, which reports average precision with 
different methods as well as the number of 
relevant documents retrieved. UM is the basic 
unigram model without query expansion (i.e. we 
use MLE for the query model, while the 
document model is smoothed with Dirichlet 
method). CIQE is the context-independent query 
expansion model using unigram relations (Model 
1). CDQE is the context-dependent query 
expansion model using biterm relations (Model 
2). In the table, we also indicate whether the 
improvement in average precision obtained is 
statistically significant (t-test).

significant according to t-test: * indicates p<0.05, **

compared to CIQE. 
CIQE and CDQE vs. UM 
It is interesting to observe that query expansion, 
either by CIQE or CDQE, consistently 
outperforms the basic unigram model on all the 
collections. In all the cases except CIQE for 
WSJ, the improvements in average precision are 
statistically significant. At the same time, the 
increases in the number of relevant documents 
retrieved are also consistent with those in average 
precision. 
The improvement scales obtained with CIQE 
are relatively small: from 1% to 10%. These 
correspond to the typical figure using this 
method.  
Comparing CIQE and CDQE, we can see that 
context-dependent query expansion (CDQE) 
556
 always produces better effectiveness than 
context-independent expansion (CIQE). The 
improvements range between 10% and 17%. All 
the improvements obtained by CDQE are 
statistically significant. This result strongly 
suggests that in general, the context-dependent 
term relations identify better expansion terms 
than context-independent unigram relations. This 
confirms our earlier hypothesis.  
Indeed, when we look at the expansion 
results, we see that the expansion terms 
suggested by biterm relations are usually better. 
For example, the (stemmed) expansion terms for 
the query ?insider trading? suggested 
respectively by CIQE and CDQE are as follows:

drexel:0.0075 fraud:0.0071 law:0.0063 
ivan:0.0060 ? 
We can see that in general, the terms suggested 
by CDQE are much more relevant. In particular, 
it has been able to suggest ?boeski? (Boesky) 
who is involved in an insider trading scandal. 
Several other terms are also highly relevant, such 
as scandal, investing, sec, drexel, fraud, etc. 
The addition of these new terms does not only 
improve recall. Precision of top-ranked 
documents is also improved. This can be seen in 
Figure 1 where we compare the full precision-
recall curve for the AP collection for the three 
models. We can see that at all the recall levels, 
the precision values always follow the following 
order: CDQE > UM. The same observation is 
also made on the other collections. This shows 
that the CDQE method does not increase recall to 
the detriment of precision, but both of them. In 
contrast, CIQE increases precision at all but 0.0 
recall points: the precision at the 0.0 recall point 
is 0.6565 for CIQE and 0.6699 for UM. This 
shows that CIQE can slightly deteriorate the top-
ranked few documents.

CDQE vs. Pseudo-relevance feedback 
Pseudo-relevance feedback is widely considered 
to be an effective query expansion method. In 
many previous experiments, it produced very 
good results. The mixture model (Zhai and 
Lafferty, 2001) is a representative and effective 
method to implement pseudo-relevance feedback: 
It uses a set of feedback documents to smooth the 
original query model. Compared to the mixture 
model, our CDQE method is also more effective: 
By manually tuning the parameters of the mixture 
model to their best, we obtained the average 
precisions of 0.3171, 0.2393 and 0.2565 
respectively for AP, SJM and WSJ collections. 
These values are lower than those obtained with 
CDQE, which has not been heavily tuned.  
For the same query ?insider trading?, the mixture 
model determines the following expansion terms: 
Mixture: stock:0.0259256 secur:0.0229553 
market:0.0157057 sec:0.013992 
inform:0.011658 firm:0.0110419

commiss:0.0059618 foreign:0.00582441 
bank:0.00572947 investig:0.00572276 
We can see that some of these terms overlap with 
those suggested by biterm relations. However, 
interesting words such as boeski, drexel and 
scandal are not suggested. 
The above comparison shows that our method 
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of query 
expansion developed so far. 
4.2 Effect of the Smoothing Parameter  
In the previous experiments, we have fixed the 
smoothing parameters. In this series of tests, we 
557
 analyze the effect of this smoothing parameter on 
retrieval effectiveness. The following figure 
shows the change of average precision (AvgP) 
using CDQE (Model 2) along with the change of 
the parameter 2? (UM is equivalent to 12 =? ).

We can see that for all the three collections, 
the effectiveness is good when the parameter is 
set in the range of 0.1-0.5. The best value for 
different collections remains stable: 0.2-0.3.  
The effect of 1?  on Model 1 is slightly 
different, but we observe the same trend. 
4.3 Number of Expansion Terms 
In the previous tests, we limit the number of 
expansion terms to 80. When different numbers 
of expansion terms are used, we obtain different 
effectiveness measures. The following figure 
shows the variation of average precision (AvgP) 
with different numbers of expansion terms, using 
CDQE method.

We can see that when more expansion terms 
are added, the effectiveness does not always 
increase. In general, a number around 80 will 
produce good results. In some cases, even if 
better effectiveness can be obtained with more 
expansion terms, the retrieval time is also longer. 
The number 80 seems to produce a good 
compromise between effectiveness and retrieval 
speed: the retrieval time remains less than 1 sec. 
per query. 
4.4 Suitability of Relations Across 
Collections 
In many real applications (e.g. Web search), we 
do not have a static document collection from 
which relations can be extracted. The question is 
whether it is possible and beneficial to extract 
relations from one text collection and use them to 
retrieve documents in another text collection. Our 
intuition is that this is possible because the 
relations (especially context-dependent relations) 
encode general knowledge, which can be applied 
to a different collection. In order to show this, we 
extracted term relations from each collection, and 
applied them on other collections. The following 
tables show the effectiveness produced using 
respectively unigram and bi-term relations. 
Table 3. Cross-utilization of relations 
 
Unigram relation Biterm relation 
   Rel. 
Coll. AP SJM WSJ AP SJM WSJ 
AP 0.2902  0.2803  0.2793 0.3383 0.3057 0.2987 
SJM 0.2271 0.2225 0.2267 0.2424 0.2448 0.2453 
WSJ 0.2541  0.2445  0.2393 0.2816 0.2636 0.2710 
 
From this table, we can observe that relations 
extracted from any collection are useful to some 
degree: they all outperform UM (see Table 2). In 
particular, the relations extracted from AP are the 
best for almost all the collections. This can be 
explained by the larger size and wider coverage 
of the AP collection. This suggests that we do not 
necessarily need to extract term relations from 
the same text collection on which retrieval is 
performed. It is possible to extract relations from 
a large text collection, and apply them to other 
collections. This opens the door to the possibility 
of constructing a general relation base for various 
document collections. 
5. Related Work 
Co-occurrence analysis is a common method to 
determine term relations. The previous studies 
have been limited to relations between two 
words, which we called unigram relations. This 
expansion approach has been integrated both in 
traditional retrieval models (Jing and Croft, 
1994) and in LM (Berger and Lafferty 1999). As 
we observed, this type of relation will introduce 
much noise into the query, leading to unstable 
effectiveness. 
Several other studies tried to filter out noise 
expansion (or translation) terms by considering 
the relations between them (Gao et al, 2002; 
558
 Jang et al 1999; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al 
2005). However, this is insufficient to detect all 
the noise. The key issue is the ambiguity of 
relations due to the lack of context information in 
the relations. In this paper, we proposed a method 
to add some context information into relations.  
 (Lin, 1997) also tries to solve word ambiguity 
by adding syntactic dependency as context. 
However, our approach does not require 
determining syntactic dependency. The principle 
of our approach is more similar to (Yarowsky, 
1995). Compared to this latter, our approach is 
less demanding: we do not need to identify 
manually the exact word senses and seed context 
words. The process is fully automatic. This 
simplification is made possible due to the 
requirement for IR: only in-context related words 
are required, but not the exact senses.  
Our work is also related to (Smadja and 
McKeown, 1996), which tries to determine the 
translation of collocations. Term combinations or 
biterms we used can be viewed as collocations. 
Again, there is much less constraint for our 
related terms than translations in (Smadja and 
McKeown, 1996). 
6. Conclusions 
In many NLP applications such as IR, we need to 
determine relations between terms. In most 
previous studies, one tries to determine the 
related terms to one single term (word). This 
makes the resulting relations ambiguous. 
Although several approaches have been proposed 
to remove afterwards some of the inappropriate 
terms, this only affects part of the noise, and 
much still remains. In this paper, we argue that 
the solution to this problem lies in the addition of 
context information in the relations between 
terms. We proposed to add another word in the 
condition of the relations so as to help constrain 
the context of application. Our experiments 
confirm that this addition of limited context 
information can indeed improve the quality of 
term relations and query expansion in IR. 
In this paper, we only compared biterm 
relations and unigram relations, the general 
method can be extended to triterm relations or 
more complex relations, provided that they can 
be extracted efficiently.  
This paper only investigated the utilization of 
context-dependent relations in IR. These relations 
can be applied in many other tasks, such as 
machine translation, word sense disambiguation / 
discrimination, and so on. These are some 
interesting research work in the future.
