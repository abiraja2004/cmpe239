Abstract
In this work, we try a hybrid methodology for
language modeling where both morphological
decomposition and factored language model-
ing (FLM) are exploited to deal with the com-
plex morphology of Arabic language. At the
end, we are able to obtain from 3.5% to 7.0%
relative reduction in word error rate (WER)
with respect to a traditional full-words sys-
tem, and from 1.0% to 2.0% relative WER re-
duction with respect to a non-factored decom-
posed system.
1 Introduction
Arabic language is characterized by a complex mor-
phological structure where different kinds of pre-
fixes and suffixes are appended to the word stems
producing a very large number of inflectional forms.
This leads to poor language model (LM) probabil-
ity estimates, and thus high LM perplexities (PPLs)
causing problems in large vocabulary continuous
speech recognition (LVCSR). One successful ap-
proach to deal with this problem is to consider LMs
including morphologically decomposed words. An-
other approach is to use the factored language mod-
els (FLMs) which are powerful models that com-
bine multiple sources of information and efficiently
integrate them via a complex backoff mechanism
(Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003).
Morphological decomposition is successfully
used for Arabic LMs in several previous works.
Some are based on linguistic knowledge, and oth-
ers are based on unsupervised methods. Some of the
linguistic methods are based on the Buckwalter Ara-
bic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) like in (Lamel
et al, 2008). Alternatively, in our previous work
(El-Desoky et al, 2009), we use the Morphological
Analyzer and Disambiguator for Arabic (MADA)
(Habash and Rambow, 2007). On the other side,
most of the unsupervised methods are based on the
minimum description length principle (MDL) like in
(Creutz et al, 2007).
Another type of models is the FLM, in which
words are viewed as vectors of K factors, so that
wt := {f1:Kt }. A factor could be any feature of the
word such as morphological class, stem, root or even
a semantic feature. An FLM is a model over factors,
i.e., p(f1:Kt |f
1:K
t?1 , f
1:K
t?2 , ..., f
1:K
t?n+1), which could be
reformed as a product of probabilities of the form
p(f |f1, f2, ..., fN ). The main idea of the model is to
backoff to other factors when some word n-gram is
not observed in the training data, thus improving the
probability estimates.
In this work we try to combine the strengths
of morphological decomposition and factored lan-
guage modeling. Therefore, language models with
factored morphemes are used. For this purpose, the
LM training data are processed such that full-words
are decomposed into prefix-stem-suffix format with
different added features. We compare our approach
with the standard full-word, decomposed word, and
factored full-word n-gram approaches.
2 Factorization and Decomposition
We use MADA 2.0 in order to perform morphologi-
cal analysis and attach a complete set of morpholog-
ical tags to Arabic words in context. From those tags
701
we derive three different features. Moreover, we de-
rive a fourth feature based on the root of the word
generated by ?Sebawai? (Darwish, 2002). The list
of features is:
? ?W? (Word): word surface form.
? ?L? (Lexeme): word lexeme.
? ?M? (Morph): morphological description.
? ?P? (Pattern): word after subtracting root.
The LM training corpora are processed so that
words are replaced by the factored representation as
required by SRILM-FLM extensions (Kirchhoff et
al., 2008). Then, word decomposition is performed
based on MADA as described in our previous publi-
cation (El-Desoky et al, 2009).
3 FLM topologies
In order to obtain a good performance via FLMs, we
need to optimize the FLM parameters: the combi-
nation of the conditioning factors, backoff path, and
smoothing options. For this purpose, we use a Ge-
netic Algorithm based FLM optimization tool (GA-
FLM) developed by Kirchhoff (2006) which seeks to
minimize the PPL over some held-out text. Further-
more, we apply some manual optimization to fine
tune the FLM parameters. For memory limitations,
we only use factors up to 2 previous time slots (tri-
gram like models). Finally, we come up with a set
of competing FLMs with rather close PPLs. In Ta-
ble 1, we record the PPLs measured for some held-
out text. The first column gives the combination of
the parent factors. So that, FLM1 corresponds to
the model P (Wt|Wt?1,Wt?2), which is the FLM
equivalent of the standard tri-gram LM (our base-
line model), while FLM2 & FLM3 correspond to
the model P (Wt|Wt?1,Mt?1, Lt?1, Pt?1,Wt?2),
however FLM4 & FLM5 correspond to the model
P (Wt|Wt?1,Mt?1, Lt?1,Wt?2,Mt?2, Lt?2). The
?gtmin? refers to the count threshold that is suffi-
cient to have a language model hit at some node of
the the backoff graph (for exact topologies, contact
the first author). From Table 1, comparing PPLs
(non-normalized) across factored and non-factored
LMs, we see that using more factors other than the
normal word could help decreasing the PPL. This is
true for all the used types of vocabulary units.

In order to select the best FLM topology, we run
a simple one pass recognition for a small internal
dev corpus derived from GALE data sets, consists
of 40 minutes of audio data recorded during January
to March 2007. The acoustic models are within-
word tri-phone models trained using 1100h of au-
dio material. The basic acoustic models are trained
based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Then,
a discriminative training based on Minimum Phone
Error (MPE) criterion is performed to enhance the
models. A 70k full-words lexicon is used. The
FLM training data consists of 206 Million running
full-words. A standard bi-gram LM based on full-
words is used to generate N-best lists, then N-best
list rescoring is performed using the different FLM
topologies shown in Table 1. We start by N = 1000-
best down to 3-best sentences. Using N = 10 always
gives the best results. The recognition WERs are
recorded in Table 2. The least WER is obtained with
FLM4. We note that the best FLM does not corre-
spond to the least PPL. This is because a higher ?gt-
min? value causes more backoff in cases of insuffi-
cient data leading to better estimates. Therefore, we
select FLM4 for the coming experiments.

4 Experimental Setup
Our recognition system is close to the one described
in section 3. However, we use within and across-
word models at different recognition passes. In ad-
dition, we use 70k or 256k lexicon of full-words or
partially decomposed words. Alternatively, we eval-
uate the results on the GALE 2007 development and
evaluation sets (dev07: 2.5h; eval07: 4h). Our rec-
ognizer works in 3 passes. In the first pass, within-
word acoustic models are used with no adaptation,
along with a standard bi-gram LM to generate lat-
tices, followed by a standard tri-gram or 4-gram LM
rescoring of lattices. The second pass does the same,
but it uses across-word models with Constrained
Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (CMLLR)
adaptation. Then, a third pass with additional Max-
imum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) adap-
tation is performed, using a standard bi-gram LM to
generate lattices or N-best lists. Then, one of the fol-
lowing is performed: 1) lattice rescoring using stan-
dard tri-gram or 4-gram LM, 2) N-best list rescoring
using FLMs based on full-words, partially or fully
decomposed words.
5 Experiments
In this section, we record our recognition results
for: 1) systems based on full-words, and 2) systems
based on decomposed words. Also, we introduce
additional results for larger lexicon sizes.
5.1 Systems Based on Full-words
In this section, we present the WERs of our recogni-
tion systems based on full-words. Where, during the
search, we use a lexicon of 70K full-words. In the
first 2 passes, we use a standard bi-gram LM to gen-
erate lattices, followed by a standard tri-gram LM
rescoring of lattices. However, in the third pass, we
generate both lattices and N-best lists based on the
same bi-gram LM. The final lattices and N-best lists
are rescored using different LMs as shown in Table
3. In case we perform N-best list rescoring with a
FLM, the N-best lists are processed to produce fac-
tored representation, followed by partial or full de-
composition as previously described in section 2.
It is clear from Table 3 that the least WER is
achieved when using N-best list rescoring using a
full-words based FLM. This gives an absolute im-

provement of 0.8% (about 4.8% relative) compared
to the standard tri-gram lattice rescoring. On the
other hand, we have 0.6% absolute improvement
(about 3.7% relative) compared to the standard 4-
gram lattice rescoring. Decomposition does not help
in this case. This is because the original N-best lists
are generated in full-words format, whose decom-
position might not lead to better LM scores. For this
reason, we expect that it is better to start with a de-
composed LM for lattice and N-best generation.
5.2 Systems Based on Decomposed Words
This section introduces the WERs of our systems
based on decomposed words. We use a similar setup
as in section 5.1. However, we use a lexicon and a
bi-gram LM based on a 70k partially decomposed
words (20k full-words + 50k morphemes). Table 4
presents the results. As expected, we get the best
WER when using N-best list rescoring with a FLM
based on partially decomposed words. An absolute
improvement of 0.4% (2.7% relative) is achieved
compared to the new baseline. Compared to the old
baseline of Table 3, we get an absolute improvement
of 2.2% (13.3% relative).
5.3 Larger Lexicon Sizes
Now, we increase the size of our lexicon to 256k
partially decomposed words (20k full-words + 236k

morphemes). In addition, we use a standard 4-
gram LM for rescoring the bi-gram lattices in the
first 2 passes. To complete our comparisons, we
record the WERs using traditional 256k full-words
lexicon, standard bi-gram search, and standard 4-
gram LM for lattice rescoring, with no decomposi-
tion or factorization. In Table 5, we see that the im-
provement persists for the larger lexicon. Compared
to the new baseline, the 256k decomposed system
achieves WER reductions of [dev07: 0.3% absolute
(2.1% relative); eval07: 0.2% absolute (1.2% rela-
tive)] when using N-best list rescoring with a FLM
based on partially decomposed words. Moreover, it
improves over the traditional full-words by [dev07:
1.0% absolute (6.7% relative); eval07: 0.6% abso-
lute (3.6% relative)]. The out-of-vocabulary rates
(OOVs) are given in Table 6. It is worth noting that
using fully decomposed lexicons as well as higher
order LMs could not improve WERs, this we previ-
ously proved in (El-Desoky et al, 2009).
6 Conclusions
We have introduced a hybrid approach to Ara-
bic language modeling. Our approach combines
the strengths of both morphological decomposition
and factored language modeling. Thus, we have
used language models with factored morphemes.
We have compared our approach to traditional ap-
proaches like: standard full-word n-grams, standard
decomposed n-grams, and full-word based factored
language models. Finally, we could achieve some
improvements over all the traditional approaches.
Nevertheless, we have only considered the use of
factored language models in the rescoring phase.
