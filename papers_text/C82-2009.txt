The project "COMMENTATOR" at the department of general 
l i ngu is t i cs  a t  the  un ivers i ty  o f  Lund i s  in tended to  tes t  
ideas  about  language product ion .  The sys tem implemented  in  
BASIC on  the  ABC80 micro -computer  generates  a scene  on the  
mon i to r  where  two persons ,  Adam and Eve,  move randomly  around 
a gate .  Not on ly  the  present  pos i t ions  of  Adam and Eve are  
shown on  the  sc reen  but  even  the  pos i t ions  be fore  the  las t  
Jump. Th is  se t t ing  i s  a l so  used  fo r  e l i c i t ing  comments f rom 
human sub jec ts .  The moves are  generated  randomly  but  the  oper -  
a tor  can  choose  the  length  o f  the  Jumps.  The in i t ia l  p lace -  
ment  o f  Adam and Eve can  be determined  by the  operator ,  as  
we l l  as  the  ins t ruct ions  fo r  the  mach ine  concern ing  the  focus  
o f  a t tent ion  (Adam or  Eve)  and the  pr imary  goa l  o f  the  ac tors  
( the  gate  or  the  o ther  ac tor ) .  On the  operator ' s  command the  
computer  p roduces  a set  o f  wr i t ten  comments on the  deve lopment  
o f  the  scene .  COM~ENTATOR i s  a research  too l ,  and  does  not  use  
any  ready-made sentences  descr ib ing  fo rseab le  s i tuat ions .  
The sys tem works as  fo l lows :  From the  pr imary  in fo rmat ion  
( the  coord inates  of  the  gate  and the  two actors )  some more 
complex  va lues  are  der ived  (d i s tances ,  re la t ions  " to  le f t " ,  " to  
r ight"  e tc . ) .  The cond i t ions  fo r  us ing  abst rac t  p red icates  
equ iva lent  to  " to  le f t "  e tc .  in  the  g iven  s i tuat ion  are  tes ted  
accoMin  6 to  a quest ion  menu. Th is  resu l t s  in  pos i t i ve  or  
negat ive  abst rac t  sentences .  The abst rac t  sentence  const i tuents  
- 42  - 
are ordered as sub. leers,  p red icates  , and oh, leers.  Connect ive  
e lements ,  such as "a l so" ,  "e i ther" ,  "yet " ,  a re  added I f  poss ib -  
le .  These connect  the las t  p ropos i t ion  to the prev ious  ones .  
Proper namesp pronouns, or  o ther  NPs are  chosen on the 
bas i s  of  re fe rence  re la t ions  to the  preced ing propos i t ion .  The 
abst rac t  p ropos i t ions  are  subst i tu ted  by sur face  phrases and 
words. The assembled s t ruc ture  i s  p r in ted .  (For a more extens -

The text  produced by COMMENTATOR may look l i ke  th i s :  
Eva ~r t i l l  h~ger om Adam. (Eve i s  to the r ight  of  Adam.) 
Hen ar  t i l l  vanster  om henne. (He I s  to the le f t  of  her . )  
Hen ~r t i l l  vanster  om por ten  cokeS. (He i s  to ~he le f t  of  the 
gate ,  too . )  
Hen n~zmar s lg  den. (He i s  approaching i t . )  
Hen n~u~na~ s ig  Eva coke&. (He i s  approaching ~re ,  too . )  
Hen ~r n~rmast por ten  dock. (L i t .  She i s  c loses t  to  the gate ,  
however. ) 
Hen ~r in te  n~ra den. (She i s  not c lose  to i t . )  
Adam ~r ln te  n~ra den he l le r .  (Adam i s  not c lose  to i t ,  e i ther . )  
COMMIE 
COMMIE is a semantically and psychollngulstlcally more 
advanced program, which i s  in tended to overcome cer ta in  shor t -  
comlngs exper ienced wi th  the or ig ina l  COMMENTATOR. This more 
complex pro~am generates  a more soph is t i ca ted  and more dynamic 
s t imulus  inc lud ing  more ob jec ts  and persons on the  scene and 
the vocabulary  i s  about ten  t imes la rger .  COMMIE i s  to produce 
human- l ike texts .  One important  task  i s  to avo id  unnecessary  
redundanc ies .  The commentaries produced have to be based on 
re levant  changes of  the scene and they must avoid repet i t ions ,  
inc lud ing  in fo rmat ion  impl ied  by prev ious  u t te rances .  (g .g . ,  
"Adam i s  to  the le f t  of  Eve" imp l ies  "Eve i s  to the r ight  o f  
Adam", e tc . )  Not a l l  p ropos i t ions  that  ere  not t rue  in  the 
given.moment deserve to be ment ioned,  e i ther .  Negated s ta te -  
- 43 - 
ments are meaningfu l  on ly  as answers to expectat ions  evoked 
by the pre~ou8 context .  (E .g . ,  "Ber t i l  i s  chas ing  Eve. He i s  
not ver~ near  her  yet ,  however."  but not l "Ber t i l  i s  chas in  K 
Eve. Ne i ther  of  them i s  in  the  .upper r iEht  corner" . )  
A l l  in fo rmat ion  about the world o f  the ~V screen  i s  
s to red  in  a two-d~nensione? ar ray  as mi~L-thouKhte - two-p lace  
pred icat ions  that  are  e i ther  t rue  or  fa l se  at  the  g iven  moment. 
Yorget t ln8  i s  s~nu la ted  by 8radu~l ly  le t t ing  the contents  of  
the  ar ray  pass a hor i zon  of  fo rget t ing .  In  a fu ture  vers ion  
the bas ic  contents  may be s tored  in  & lon8 term memory. The 
p~ed?cat ions  of  the ar ray  serve  88 inputs  fo r  generat i~  complex 
semantic  structu~res,  which are  inputs  to  the product ion  of  
commentaries proper .  Re fer r ing  in  OOU~IE i s  to  be based on the 
theory  of  FSP. By computiz~ "de~rees  of  ~Lveness" ,  i t  shoUld 
be ab le  to  cope wi th  even such problems as the d i f fe rence  
between themat ic  pronominal vs .  themat ic  zero sub jec ts  in  
Sla3~o langusKes genera l ly  or the enc l i t i o  vs .  fu l l  forms of  
ob l ique  pronominal cases  in  West S lav ic  le~gue~es e tc .  (Cfe 
B i ly  1981a, Chapter  Three . )  The deep s t ruc tures  are  to be 
"un ivers8~"  enough to  a l low generat ion  of  comments~es in  
severa l '  lan~ae~es.  
COMMIE w i l l  a l so  have more soph is t i ca ted  cond i t ions  fo r  
the  use of  the two-p lace  pred icates .  Ins tead  o f ,  e .g . ,  pure ly  
geometr i ca l l y  de f ined  cond i t ions  fo r  "X i s  to the  le f t  of  Y" 
to  be t rue ,  a cer ta in  l im i t  i s  put on the a l lowed ver t i ca l  
d i s tance .  The l im i t  seems to  be a funct ion  of  the s i ze  of  X 
and ?,  the s i ze  of  the re ferent ia l  frame and the  focus of  
a t tent ion .  (Cf .  B i l y  1981b)
