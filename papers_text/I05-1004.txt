Abstract. Automatic image annotation is a newly developed and promising 
technique to provide semantic image retrieval via text descriptions. It concerns 
a process of automatically labeling the image contents with a pre-defined set of 
keywords which are exploited to represent the image semantics. A Maximum 
Entropy Model-based approach to the task of automatic image annotation is 
proposed in this paper. In the phase of training, a basic visual vocabulary con-
sisting of blob-tokens to describe the image content is generated at first; then 
the statistical relationship is modeled between the blob-tokens and keywords by 
a Maximum Entropy Model constructed from the training set of labeled images. 
In the phase of annotation, for an unlabeled image, the most likely associated 
keywords are predicted in terms of the blob-token set extracted from the given 
image. We carried out experiments on a medium-sized image collection with 
about 5000 images from Corel Photo CDs. The experimental results demon-
strated that the annotation performance of this method outperforms some tradi-
tional annotation methods by about 8% in mean precision, showing a potential 
of the Maximum Entropy Model in the task of automatic image annotation. 
1   Introduction 
Last decade has witnessed an explosive growth of multimedia information such as 
images and videos. However, we can?t access to or make use of the relevant informa-
tion more leisurely unless it is organized so as to provide efficient browsing and que-
rying. As a result, an important functionality of next generation multimedia informa-
tion management system will undoubtedly be the search and retrieval of images and 
videos on the basis of visual content.  
In order to fulfill this ?intelligent? multimedia search engines on the world-wide-
web, content-based image retrieval techniques have been studied intensively during 
the past few years. Through the sustained efforts, a variety of state-of-the-art methods 
employing the query-by-example (QBE) paradigm have been well established. By this 
we mean that queries are images and the targets are also images. In this manner, vis-
ual similarity is computed between user-provided image and database images based 
on the low-level visual features such as color, texture, shape and spatial relationships. 
However, two important problems still remain. First, due to the limitation of object 
recognition and image understanding, semantics-based image segmentation algorithm 
 Automatic Image Annotation Using Maximum Entropy Model 35 
is unavailable, so segmented region may not correspond to users? query object. Sec-
ond, visual similarity is not semantic similarity which means that low-level features 
are easily extracted and measured, but from the users? point of view, they are non-
intuitive. It is not easy to use them to formulate the user?s needs. We encounter a so-
called semantic gap here. Typically the starting point of the retrieval process is the 
high-level query from users. So extracting image semantics based on the low-level 
visual features is an essential step. As we know, semantic information can be repre-
sented more accurately by using keywords than by using low-level visual features. 
Therefore, building relationship between associated text and low-level image features 
is considered to an effective solution to capture the image semantics. By means of this 
hidden relationship, images can be retrieved by using textual descriptions, which is 
also called query-by-keyword (QBK) paradigm. Furthermore, textual queries are a 
desirable choice for semantic image retrieval which can resort to the powerful text-
based retrieval techniques. The key to image retrieval using textual queries is image 
annotation. But most images are not annotated and manually annotating images is a 
time-consuming, error-prone and subjective process. So, automatic image annotation 
is the subject of much ongoing research. Its main goal is to assign descriptive words 
to whole images based on the low-level perceptual features, which has been recog-
nized as a promising technique for bridging the semantic gap between low-level im-
age features and high-level semantic concepts. 
Given a training set of images labeled with text (e.g. keywords, captions) that de-
scribe the image content, many statistical models have been proposed by research-
ers to construct the relation between keywords and image features. For example, co-
occurrence model, translation model and relevance-language model. By exploiting 
text and image feature co-occurrence statistics, these methods can extract hidden 
semantics from images, and have been proven successful in constructing a nice 
framework for the domain of automatic image annotation and retrieval.  
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the task of automatic image anno-
tation using Maximum Entropy Model. Though Maximum Entropy method has 
been successfully applied to a wide range of application such as machine transla-
tion, it is not much used in computer vision domain, especially in image auto  
annotation.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 de-
scribes the representation of labeled and unlabeled images, gives a brief introduc-
tion to Maximum Entropy Model and then details how to use it for automatically 
annotating unlabeled images. Section 4 demonstrates our experimental results. Sec-
tion 5 presents conclusions and a comment for future work. 
2   Related Work 
Recently, many statistical models have been proposed for automatic image annotation 
and retrieval. The work of associating keywords with low-level visual features can be 
addressed from two different perspectives.  
36 W. Li and M. Sun 
2.1   Annotation by Keyword Propagation  
This kind of approach usually formulates the process of automatic image annotation 
as one of supervised classification problems. With respect to this method, accurate 
annotation information is demanded. That is to say, given a set of training images 
labeled with semantic keywords, detailed labeling information should be provided. 
For example, from training samples, we can know which keyword corresponds to 
which image region or what kind of concept class describes a whole-image. So each 
or a set of annotated keyword can be considered as an independent concept class, 
followed by training each class model with manually labeled images, then the model 
is applied to classify each unlabeled image into a relevant concept class, and finally 
producing annotation by propagating the corresponding class words to unlabeled 
images.  
Wang and Li [8] introduced a 2-D multi- resolution HMM model to automate lin-
guistic indexing of images. Clusters of fixed-size blocks at multiple resolution and the 
relationships between these clusters is summarized both across and within the resolu-
tions. To annotate the unlabeled image, words of the highest likelihood is selected 
based on the comparison between feature vectors of new image and the trained con-
cept models. Chang et al[5] proposed content-based soft annotation (CBSA) for pro-
viding images with semantic labels using (BPM) Bayesian Point Machine. Starting 
with labeling a small set of training images, an ensemble of binary classifier for each 
keyword is then trained for predicting label membership for images. Each image is 
assigned one keyword vector, with each keyword in the vector assigned a confidence 
factor. In the process of annotation, words with high confidence are considered to be 
the most likely descriptive words for the new images. The main practical problem 
with this kind of approaches is that a large labeled training corpus is needed. More-
over, during the training and application stages, the training set is fixed and not in-
cremented. Thus if a new domain is introduced, new labeled examples must be pro-
vided to ensure the effectiveness of such classifiers. 
2.2   Annotation by Statistical Inference 
More recently, there have been some efforts to solve this problem in a more general 
way. The second approach takes a different strategy which focuses on discovering the 
statistical links between visual features and words using unsupervised learning meth-
ods. During training, a roughly labeled image datasets is provided where a set of se-
mantic labels is assigned to a whole image, but the word-to-region information is 
hidden in the space of image features and keywords. So an unsupervised learning 
algorithm is usually adopted to estimate the joint probability distribution of words and 
image features.  
Mori et al[4] were the earliest to model the statistics using a co-occurrence prob-
abilistic model, which predicate the correct probability of associating keywords by 
counting the co-occurrence of words with image regions generated using a fixed-size 
blocks. Blocks are vector quantized to form clusters which inherit the whole set of  
 
 Automatic Image Annotation Using Maximum Entropy Model 37 
keywords assigned to each image. Then clusters are in turn used to predict the key-
words for unlabeled images. The disadvantage is that the model is a little simple and 
the rough fixed-size blocks are unable to model objects effectively, leading to poor 
annotation accuracy. Instead of using fixed-size blocks, Barnard et al[1] performed 
Blobworld segmentation and Normalized cuts to produce semantic meaningful re-
gions. They constructed a hierarchical model via EM algorithm. This model combines 
both asymmetric clustering model which maps words and image regions into clusters 
and symmetric clustering model which models the joint distribution of words and 
regions. Duygulu et al[2] proposed a translation model to map keywords to individ-
ual image regions. First, image regions are created by using a segmentation algorithm. 
For each region, visual features are extracted and then blob-tokens are generated by 
clustering the features for each region across whole image datasets. Each image can 
be represented by a certain number of these blob-tokens. Their Translation Model 
uses machine translation model ?of IBM to annotate a test set of images based on a 
large number of annotated training images. Another approach using cross-media rele-
vance models (CMRM) was introduced by Jeon et al[3]. They assumed that this 
could be viewed as analogous to the cross-lingual retrieval problem and a set of key-
words{ }nwww ...,,, 21  is related to the set of blob-tokens{ }nbbb ...,,, 21 , rather 
than one-to-one correspondence between the blob-tokens and keywords. Here the 
joint distribution of blob-tokens and words was learned from a training set of anno-
tated images to perform both automatic image annotation and ranked retrieval. Jeon et 
al [9] introduced using Maximum Entropy to model the fixed-size block and key-
words, which gives us a good hint to implement it differently. Lavrenko et al[11] 
extended the cross-media relevance model using actual continuous-valued features 
extracted from image regions. This method avoids the clustering and constructing the 
discrete visual vocabulary stage. 
3   The Implementation of Automatic Annotation Model 
3.1   The Hierarchical Framework of Automatic Annotation and Retrieval 
The following Fig. 1 shows the framework for automatic image annotation and key-
word-based image retrieval. Given a training dataset of images labeled with key-
words. First, we segment a whole image into a collection of sub-images, followed by 
extracting a set of low-level visual features to form a feature vector to describe the 
visual content of each region. Second, a visual vocabulary of blob-tokens is generated 
by clustering all the regions across the whole dataset so that each image can be repre-
sented by a number of blob-tokens from a finite set of visual symbols. Third, both 
textual information and visual information is provided to train the Maximum Entropy 
model, and the learned model is then applied to automatically generate keywords to 
describe the semantic content of an unlabeled image based on the low-level features. 
Consequently, both the users? information needs and the semantic content of images 
can be represented by textual information, which can resort to the powerful text IR 
techniques to implement this cross-media retrieval, suggesting the importance of 
textual information in semantics-based image retrieval.

3.2   Image Representation and Pre-processing 
A central issue in content-based image annotation and retrieval is how to describe the 
visual information in a way compatible with human visual perception. But until now, 
no general framework is proposed. For different tasks and goals, different low-level 
features are used to describe and analyze the visual content of images. On the whole, 
there are two kinds of interesting open questions remain unresolved. First, what fea-
ture sets should be selected to be the most expressive for any image region. Second, 
how blob-tokens can be generated, that is to say, how can one create such a visual 
vocabulary of blob-tokens to represent each image in the collection using a number of 
symbols from this finite set? In our method, we carried out these following two steps: 
First, segment images into sub-images, Second, extract appropriate features for any 
sub-images, cluster similar regions by k-means and then use the centroid in each clus-
 Automatic Image Annotation Using Maximum Entropy Model 39 
ter as a blob-token. The first step can be employed by either using a segmentation 
algorithm to produce semantically meaningful units or partitioning the image into 
fixed-size rectangular grids. Both methods have pros and cons, a general purpose 
segmentation algorithm may produce semantic regions, but due to the limitation in 
computer vision and image processing, there are also the problems of erroneous and 
unreliable region segmentation. The advantage of regular grids is that is does not need 
to perform complex image segmentation and is easy to be conducted. However, due to 
rough fixed-size rectangular grids, the extracted blocks are unable to model objects 
effectively, leading to poor annotation accuracy in our experiment.  
                   
Fig. 2. Segmentation Results using Normalized cuts and JSEG 
In this paper, we segment images into a number of meaningful regions using Nor-
malized cuts [6] against using JSEG. Because the JSEG is only focusing on local 
features and their consistencies, but Ncuts aims at extracting the global impression of 
an image data. So Ncuts may get a better segmentation result than JSEG. Fig. 2 shows 
segmentation result using Normalized cuts and JSEG respectively, the left is the origi-
nal image, the mid and the right are the segmentation result using Ncuts and JSEG 
respectively. After segmentation, each image region is described by a feature vector 
formed by HSV histograms and Gabor filters. Similar regions will be grouped to-
gether based on k-means clustering to form the visual vocabulary of blob-tokens. Too 
much clusters may cause data sparseness and too few can not converge. Then each of 
the labeled and unlabeled images can be described by a number of blob-tokens, in-
stead of the continuous-valued feature vectors. So we can avoid the image data mod-
eling in a high-dimensional and complex feature space. 
3.3   The Annotation Strategy Based on Maximum Entropy 
Maximum Entropy Model is a general purpose machine learning and classification 
framework whose main goal is to account for the behavior of a discrete-valued ran-
dom process. Given a random process whose output value y may be influenced by 
some specific contextual information x, such a model is a method of estimating the 
conditional probability.

In the process of annotation, images are segmented using normalized cuts, every 
image region is represented by a feature vector consisting of HSV color histogram 
and the Gabor filters, and then a basic visual vocabulary containing 500 blob-tokens 
is generated by k-means clustering. Finally, each segmented region is assigned to the 
label of its closest blob-token. Thus the complex visual contents of images can be 
40 W. Li and M. Sun 
represented by a number of blob-tokens. Due to the imbalanced distribution of key-
words frequency and the data sparseness problem, the size of the pre-defined keyword 
vocabulary is reduced from 1728 to 121 keywords, by keeping only the keywords 
appearing more than 30 times in the training dataset. 
We use a series of feature function ( )ji wbf ,Label,FC  to model the co-occurrence 
statistics of blob-tokens ib  and keywords jw , where FC denote the context of feature 
constraints for each blob-token. The following example represents the co-occurrence 
of the blob-token 
?
b  and the keyword ?water? in an image I.

If blob-token ib  satisfies the context of feature constraints and keyword ?water? 
also occurs in image I. In other words, if the color and texture feature components are 
coordinated with the semantic label ?water?, and then the value of the feature function 
is 1, otherwise 0. 
The following Fig. 3 shows the annotation procedure that using MaxEnt captures 
the hidden relationship between blob-tokens and keywords from a roughly labeled 
training image sets. 
 
Fig. 3. Learning the statistics of blob-tokens and words 
In the recent past, many models for automatic image annotation are limited by the 
scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit the context in the images 
and words. It is the context in which an image region is placed that gives it meaning-
ful interpretation. 
 
 Automatic Image Annotation Using Maximum Entropy Model 41 
In our annotation procedure, each annotated word is predicted independently by the 
Maximum Entropy Model, word correlations are not taken into consideration. How-
ever, correlations between annotated words are essentially important in predicting 
relevant text descriptions. For example, the words ?trees? and ?grass? are more likely 
to co-occur than the words ?trees? and ?computers?. In order to generate appropriate 
annotations, a simple language model is developed that takes the word-correlation 
information into account, and then the textual description is determined not only by 
the model linking keywords and blob-tokens but also by the word-to-word correla-
tion. We simply count the co-occurrence information between words in the pre-
defined textual set to produce a simple word correlation model to improve the annota-
tion accuracy. 
4   Experiments and Analysis 
We carried out experiments using a mid-sized image collection, comprising about 
5,000 images from Corel Stock Photo CDs, 4500 images for training and 500 for 
testing. The following table 1 shows the results of automatic image annotation using 
Maximum Entropy.

For our training datasets, the visual vocabulary and the pre-defined textual set con-
tain 500 blob-tokens and 121 keywords respectively, so the number of the training 
pairs ( )ji wb ,  is 60500. After the procedure of feature selection, only 9550 pairs left. 
For model parameters estimation, there are a few algorithms including Generalized 
Iterative Scaling and Improved Iterative Scaling which are widely used. Here we use 
Limited Memory Variable Metric method which has been proved effective for Maxi-
mum Entropy Model [10]. Finally, we can get the model linking blob-tokens and 
keywords, and then the trained model ( )xyp  is applied to predict textual annota-
tions { }nwww ,,, 21 K  given an unseen image formed by{ }mbbb ,,, 21 K . 
To further verify the feasibility and effectiveness of Maximum Entropy model, we 
have implemented the co-occurrence model as one of the baselines whose conditional

Where A denote the number of relevant images retrieved, B denote the number of

the image datasets, and images whose labels containing the query keyword is consid-
ered relevant, otherwise irrelevant.

Method Mean precision Mean recall

Maximum Entropy 0.17 0.25 
44 W. Li and M. Sun 
The above experimental results in table 2 show that our method outperforms the 
Co-occurrence model [4] in the average precision and recall. Since our model uses the 
blob-tokens to represent the contents of the image regions and converts the task of 
automatic image annotation to a process of translating information from visual lan-
guage (blob-tokens) to textual language (keywords). So Maximum Entropy Model is 
a natural and effective choice for our task, which has been successfully applied to the 
dyadic data in which observations are made from two finite sets of objects. But disad-
vantages also exist. There are two fold problems to be considered. First, since Maxi-
mum Entropy is constrained by the equation ( ) ( )fpfp ~= , which assumes that the 
expected value of output of the stochastic model should be the same as the expected 
value of the training sample. However, due to the unbalanced distribution of key-
words frequency in the training subset of Corel data, this assumption will lead to an 
undesirable problem that common words with high frequency are usually associated 
with too many irrelevant blob-tokens, whereas uncommon words with low frequency 
have little change to be selected as annotations for any image regions, consider word 
?sun? and ?apple? , since both words may be related to regions with ?red? color and 
?round? shape, but it is difficult to make a decision between the word ?sun? and ?ap-
ple?. However, since ?sun? is a common word as compared to ?apple? in the lexical 
set, the word ?sun? will definitely used as the annotation for these kind of regions. To 
address this kind of problems, our future work will mainly focus on the more sophis-
ticated language model to improve the statistics between image features and key-
words. Second, the effects of segmentation may also affect the annotation perform-
ance. As we know, semantic image segmentation algorithm is a challenging and com-
plex problem, current segmentation algorithm based on the low-level visual features 
may break up the objects in the images, that is to say, segmented regions do not defi-
nitely correspond to semantic objects or semantic concepts, which may cause the 
Maximum Entropy Model to derive a wrong decision given an unseen image. 
5   Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic image annotation and re-
trieval using Maximum Entropy Model. Compared to other traditional classical meth-
ods, the proposed model gets better annotation and retrieval results. But three main 
challenges are still remain: 
1) Semantically meaningful segmentation algorithm is still not available, so the 
segmented region may not correspond to a semantic object and region features 
are insufficient to describe the image semantics. 
2) The basic visual vocabulary construction using k-means is only based on the 
visual features, which may lead to the fact that two different semantic objects 
with similar visual features fall into the same blob-token. This may degrade the 
annotation quality. 
3) Our annotation task mainly depend on the trained model linking image features 
and keywords, the spatial context information of image regions and the word cor-
relations are not fully taken into consideration. 
In the future, more work should be done on image segmentation techniques, clus-
tering algorithms, appropriate feature extraction and contextual information between 
regions and words to improve the annotation accuracy and retrieval performance.
