Abstract
Numerative classifiers are ubiquitous in
many Asian languages. This paper pro-
poses a method to construct a taxonomy
of numerative classifiers based on a noun-
classifier agreement database. The taxon-
omy defines superordinate-subordinate rela-
tion among numerative classifiers and rep-
resents the relations in tree structures. The
experiments to construct taxonomies were
conducted for evaluation by using data from
three different languages: Chinese, Japanese
and Thai. We found that our method was
promising for Chinese and Japanese, but in-
appropriate for Thai. It confirms that there
really is no hierarchy among Thai classifiers.
1 Introduction
Many Asian languages do not mark grammatical
numbers (singular/plural) in noun form, but use nu-
merative classifiers together with numerals instead
when describing the number of nouns. Numerative
classifiers (hereafter ?classifiers?) are used with a
limited group of nouns, in particular material nouns.
In English, for example: ?three pieces of paper?. In
Asian languages these classifiers are ubiquitous and
used with common nouns. Therefore the number of
classifiers is much larger than in Western languages.
An agreement between nouns and classifiers is also
necessary, i.e., a certain noun specifies possible clas-
sifiers. The agreement is determined based on var-
ious aspects of a noun, such as its meaning, shape,
pragmatic aspect and so on.
This paper proposes a method to automati-
cally construct a taxonomy of numerative classi-
fiers for Asian languages. The taxonomy defines
superordinate-subordinate relations between classi-
fiers. For instance, the Japanese classifier ?? (to?)?
is used for counting big animals such as elephants
and tigers, while ?? (hiki)? is used for all animals.
Since ??? can be considered more general than ?
??, ??? is the superordinate classifier of ???, rep-
resented as ???  ??? in this paper. The taxon-
omy represents such superordinate-subordinate rela-
tions between classifiers in the form of a tree struc-
ture. A taxonomy of classifiers would be fundamen-
tal knowledge for natural language processing. In
addition, it will be useful for language learners, be-
cause learning usage of classifiers is rather difficult,
especially for Western language speakers.
We evaluate the proposed method by using the
data of three Asian languages: Chinese, Japanese
and Thai.
2 Noun-classifier agreement database
First, let us introduce usages of classifiers in Asian
languages. In the following examples, ?CL? stands
for classifier.
? Chinese: yi-ju
(CL)
dian-hua
(telephone)
? ? ? a telephone
? Japanese: inu
(dog)
2 hiki
(CL)
? ? ? 2 dogs
? Thai: nakrian
(student)
3 khon
(CL)
? ? ? 3 students

As mentioned earlier, the agreement between nouns
and classifiers is observed. For instance, the
Japanese classifier ?hiki? in the above example
agrees with only animals. The agreement is also
found in Chinese and Thai.
The proposed method to construct a classifier tax-
onomy is based on agreement between nouns and
classifiers. First we prepare a collection of pairs
(n, c) of a noun n and a classifier c which agrees
with n for a language. The statistics of our Chinese,
Japanese, and Thai database are summarized in Ta-
ble 1.
Table 1: Noun-classifier agreement database
Chinese Japanese Thai
No. of (n,c) pairs 28,202 9,582 9,618
No. of nouns (type) 10,250 4,624 8,224
No. of CLs (type) 205 331 608
The Japanese database was built by extracting
noun-classifier pairs from a dictionary (Iida, 2004)
which enumerates nouns and their corresponding
classifiers. The Chinese database was derived from
a dictionary (Huang et al, 1997). The Thai database
consists of a mixture of two kinds of noun-classifier
pairs: 8,024 nouns and their corresponding classi-
fiers from a dictionary of a machine translation sys-
tem (CICC, 1995) and 200 from a corpus. The pairs
from the corpus were manually checked for their va-
lidity.
3 Proposed Method
3.1 Extracting superordinate-subordinate
relations of classifiers
We extracted superordinate-subordinate classifier
pairs based on inclusive relations of sets of nouns
agreeing with those classifiers. Suppose that Nk is
a set of nouns that agrees with a classifier ck. If Ni
subsumes Nj (Ni ? Nj), we can estimate that ci
subsumes cj (ci  cj). For instance, in our Japanese
database, the classifier ?? (ten)? agrees with shops
such as ?drug store?, ?kiosk? and ?restaurant?, and
these nouns also agree with ?? (ken)?, since ??? is
a classifier which agrees with any kind of building.
Thus, we can estimate the relation ???  ???.
Given a certain classifier cj , ci satisfying the fol-
lowing two conditions (1) and (2) is considered as a
N
j

Condition (1) requires that a superordinate classifier
agrees with more nouns than a subordinate classifier.
IR(ci, cj) is an inclusion ratio representing to what
extent nouns in Nj are also included in Ni (the ratio
of the light gray area to the area of the small circle
in Figure 1).
Condition (2) means that if IR(ci, cj) is greater
than a certain threshold T
ir
, we estimate a
superordinate-subordinate relation between ci and
cj . The basic idea is that superordinate-subordinate
relations are extracted when Nj is a proper subset
of Ni, i.e. IR(ci, cj) = 1, but this is too strict. In
order to extract more relations, we loosen this condi-
tion such that relations are extracted when IR(ci, cj)
is large enough. If we set Tir lower, more relations
can be acquired, but they may be less reliable.

Table 2 shows the results of our experiments to
extract superordinate-subordinate relations of classi-
fiers. The threshold T
ir
was determined in an ad hoc
manner for each language. The numbers of extracted
superordinate-subordinate relations are shown in the
second row in the table. Manual inspection of the
sampled relations revealed that many reasonable re-
lations were extracted. The objective evaluation of
these extracted relations will be discussed in 4.2.

The third row in Table 2 indicates the numbers of
classifiers which were not included in the extracted
superordinate-subordinate relations with its ratio to
the total number of classifiers in the database in
parentheses. We found that no relation is extracted
for a large number of Thai classifiers.
3.2 Constructing structure
The structure of a taxonomy is constructed based
on a set of superordinate-subordinate relations be-
tween classifiers. Currently we adopt a very naive
approach to construct structures, i.e., starting from
the most superordinate classifiers as roots, we ex-
tend trees downward to less general classifiers by
using the extracted superordinate-subordinate rela-
tions. Note that since there is more than one classi-
fier that does not have any superordinate classifiers,
we will have a set of trees rather than a single tree.
When constructing structures, redundant relations
are ignored in order to make the structures as concise
as possible. A relation is considered redundant if the
relation can be inferred by using other relations and
transitivity of the relations. The formal definition of
redundant relations is given below:
ca  cb is redundant iff ?cm : ca  cm, cm  cb
Statistics of constructed structures for each lan-
guage are shown in Table 3. More than 50 iso-
lated structures (trees) were obtained for Chinese
and Japanese, while more than 100 for Thai. We ob-
tained several large structures, the largest containing
45, 85 and 23 classifiers for Chinese, Japanese and
Thai, respectively. As indicated in the fifth row in
Table 3, however, many structures consisting of only
2 classifiers were also constructed.

4 Discussion
In this section, we will discuss the results of our
experiments. First 4.1 discusses appropriateness of
our method for the three languages. Then we eval-
uate our method in more detail. The evaluation of
extracted superordinate-subordinate relations is de-
scribed in 4.2, and the evaluation of structures in 4.3.
4.1 Comparison of different languages
According to the results of our experiments, the
proposed method seems promising for Chinese and
Japanese, but not for Thai. From the Thai data,
no relation was obtained for about 60% of classi-
fiers (Table 2), and many small fragmented struc-
tures were created (Table 3).
This is because of the characteristic that nouns
and classifiers are strongly coupled in Thai, i.e.,
many classifiers agree with only one noun. In our
Thai database, 252 (41.5%) classifiers agree with
only one noun. This means that the overlap between
two noun sets Ni and Nj can be quite small, making
the inclusion ratio IR(ci, cj) very small. Out basic
idea is that we can extract superordinate-subordinate
relations between two classifiers when the overlap of
their corresponding noun sets is large. However, this
assumption does not hold in Thai classifiers. The
above facts suggest that there seems to be no hierar-
chical taxonomy of classifiers in Thai.
4.2 Evaluation of extracted relations
4.2.1 Analysis of Nouns in Nj \ Ni
As explained in 3.1, our method extracts a relation
ci  cj even when Ni does not completely subsume
Nj . We analysed nouns in the relative complement
of Ni in Nj (Nj \Ni), i.e., the dark gray area in Fig-
ure 1. The relation ci  cj implies that all nouns
which are countable with a subordinate classifier cj
are also countable with its superordinate classifier ci,
but there is no guarantee of this for nouns in Nj \Ni,
since we loosened the condition as in (2) by intro-
ducing a threshold.
To see to what extent nouns in Nj \ Ni agree
with ci as well, we manually verified the agreement
of nouns in Nj \ Ni and ci for all extracted rela-
tions ci  cj . The verification was done by native
speakers of each language. Results of the valida-
tion are summarized in Table 4. For Japanese and
Chinese, multiple judges verified the results. When
judgments conflicted, we decided the final decision
by a discussion of two judges for Japanese, and by
majority voting for Chinese. The 4th and 5th rows
399
in Table 4 show the agreement of judgments. The
?Agreement ratio? is the ratio of cases that judg-
ments agree. Since three judges verified nouns for
Chinese, we show the average of the agreement ra-
tios for two judges out of the three. The agreement
ratio and Cohen?s ? is relatively high for Japanese,
but not for Chinese. We found many uncertain cases
for Chinese nouns. For example, ?? (wei)? is a clas-
sifier used when counting people with honorific per-
spective. However, judgement if ??? can modify
nouns such as ?political prisoner? or ?local villain?
is rather uncertain.

Table 4 reveals that a considerable number of
nouns in Nj \ Ni are actually countable with ci,
meaning that our databases do not include noun-
classifier agreement exhaustively.
4.2.2 Reliability of relations ??
Based on the analysis in 4.2.1, we evaluate ex-
tracted superordinate-subordinate relations. We de-
fine the reliability R of the relation ci  cj as
R(ci  cj) =
|Ni ? Nj |+ |NCj,i|
|Nj |
, (3)
where, NCj,i is a subset of Nj \ Ni consisting of
nouns which are manually judged to agree with ci.
We can consider that the more strictly this statement
holds, the more reliable the extracted relations will
be.
Figure 2 shows the relations between the thresh-
old T
ir
and both the number of extracted relations
and their reliability. The horizontal axis indicates
the threshold T
ir
in (2). The bar charts indicate the
number of extracted relations, while the line graphs
indicate the averages of reliability of all extracted re-
lations. Of course, if we set T
ir
lower, we can extract
more relations at the cost of their reliability. How-
ever, even when T
ir
is set to the lowest value, the
averages of reliability are relatively high, i.e. 0.98
(Chinese), 0.91 (Japanese) and 0.99 (Thai). Thus
we can conclude that the extracted superordinate-
subordinate relations are reliable enough.
4.3 Evaluation of structures
As in ordinary ontologies, we will assume that prop-
erties of superordinate classifiers can be inherited to
their subordinate classifiers. In other words, a clas-
sifier taxonomy suggests transitivity of agreement
with nouns over superordinate-subordinate relations
as
c
1
 c
2
? c
2
 c
3
? c
1
 c
3
.
In order to evaluate the structures of our taxonomy,
we verify the validity of transitivity.
First, we extracted all pairs of classifiers having
an ancestor-descendant relation from our classifier
taxonomy. Hereafter we denote ancestor-descendant
pairs of classifiers as (ca, cd), where ca is an ances-
tor and cd an descendant. The path from ca to cd on
the taxonomy can be represented as
c
0
(= ca)  c1  ...  cn(= cd). (4)
We denote a superordinate-subordinate relation de-
rived by transitivity as
?
, such as c
0
?
 cn. Among
all ancestor-descendant relations, we extracted ones
with a path length of more than one, or n > 1
in (4). Then we compare R(ca
?
 cd), the re-
liability of a relation derived by transitivity, with
R(ci  ci+1) (0 ? i < n), the reliability of di-
rect relations in the path from ca to cd. If these are
comparable, we can conclude that transitivity in the
taxonomy is valid.
Table 5 shows the results of the analysis of transi-
tivity. As indicated in the column ?all? in Table 5, 78
and 86 ancestor-descendant pairs (ca, cd) were ex-
tracted from the Chinese and Japanese classifier tax-
onomy, respectively. In contrast, only 6 pairs were
extracted from the Thai taxonomy, since each struc-
ture of the Thai taxonomy is rather small as we al-
ready discussed with Table 3. Thus we have omit-
ted further analysis of Thai. The extracted ancestor-
descendant pairs of classifiers are then classified into
three cases, (A), (B) and (C). Their numbers are
shown in the last three rows in Table 5, where mini
and maxi denote the minimum and maximum of re-
liability among all direct relations R(ci  ci+1) in
the path from ca to cd.

In case (A), reliability of a relation derived by
transitivity, R(ca
?
 cd), is less than that of any di-
rect relations, R(ci  ci+1). In case (B), reliability
of a transitive relation is comparable with that of di-
rect relations, i.e. R(ca
?
 cd) is greater or equal to
mini and less than maxi. In case (C), the transitive
relation is more reliable than direct relations.
The average of the reliability of ca
?
 cd is rela-
tively high, 0.88 for Chinese and 0.77 for Japanese.
We also found that more than 70% of derived rela-
tions (case (B) and case (C)) are comparable to or
greater than direct relations. The above facts indi-
cate transitivity on our structural taxonomy is valid
to some degree.
From a different point of view, we divided pairs
of (ca, cd) into two other cases, ?direct? and ?indi-
rect? as shown in the columns of Table 5. The ?di-
rect? case includes the relations which are also ex-
tracted by our method. Note that such relations are
discarded as redundant ones. On the other hand, the
?indirect? case includes the relations which can not
be extracted from the database but only inferred by
using transitivity on the taxonomy. That is, they are
truly new relations. In order to calculate reliability
of ?indirect? cases, we performed additional manual
validation of nouns in Nd\Na.
However, the average of R(ca
?
 cd) in ?in-
direct? cases is not so high for both Chinese and
Japanese, as a large amount of pairs are classi-
fied into case (A). Thus it is not effective to infer
new superordinate-subordinate relations by transi-
tivity. Since we currently only adopted a very naive
method to construct a classifier taxonomy, more so-
phisticated methods should be explored in order to
prevent inferring irrelevant relations.
5 Related Work
Bond (2000) proposed a method to choose an appro-
priate classifier for a noun by referring its seman-
tic class. This method is implemented in a sentence
generation module of a machine translation system.
Similar attempts to generate both Japanese and Ko-
rean classifiers were also reported (Paik and Bond,
2001). Bender and Siegel (2004) implemented a
HPSG that handles several intricate structures in-
cluding Japanese classifiers. Matsumoto (1993)
reported his close analysis of Japanese classi-
fiers based on prototype semantics. Sornlertlam-
vanich (1994) presented an algorithm for selecting
an adequate classifier for a noun by using a cor-
pus. Their research can be regarded as a method to
construct a noun-classifier agreement database au-
401
tomatically from corpora. We used databases de-
rived from dictionaries except for a small number
of noun-classifier pairs in Thai, because we believe
dictionaries provide more reliable and stable infor-
mation than corpora, and in addition they were avail-
able and on hand. Note that we are not concerned
with frequencies of noun-classifier coocurrence in
this study. Huang (1998) proposed a method to
construct a noun taxonomy based on noun-classifier
agreement that is very similar to ours, but aims at
developing a taxonomy for nouns rather than one for
classifiers. There has not been very much work on
building resources concerning noun-classifier agree-
ment. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
construct a classifier taxonomy.
6 Conclusion
This paper proposed a method to construct a tax-
onomy of numerative classifiers based on a noun-
classifier agreement database. First, superordinate-
subordinate relations of two classifiers are extracted
by measuring the overlap of two sets of nouns agree-
ing with each classifier. Then these relations are
used as building blocks to build a taxonomy of
tree structures. We conducted experiments to build
classifier taxonomies for three languages: Chinese,
Japanese and Thai. The effectiveness of our method
was evaluated by measuring reliability of extracted
relations, and verifying validity of transitivity in the
taxonomy. We found that extracted relations are re-
liable, and the transitivity in the taxonomy relatively
valid. Relations inferred by transitivity, however, are
less reliable than those directly derived from noun-
classifier agreement.
Future work includes investigating a way to en-
large classifier taxonomies. Currently, not all clas-
sifiers are included in our taxonomy, and it con-
sists of a set of fragmented structures. A more so-
phisticated method to build a large taxonomy in-
cluding more classifiers should be examined. Our
method should also be refined in order to make
superordinate-subordinate relations inferred by the
transitivity more reliable. We are now investigat-
ing a stepwise method to construct taxonomies that
prefers more reliable relations, i.e. an initial tax-
onomy is built with a small number of highly reli-
able relations, and is then expanded with less reli-
able ones.
