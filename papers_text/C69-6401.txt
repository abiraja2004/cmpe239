A PROGRESS REPORT ON 
THE USE OF  SLANT GRAMMAR CALCULUS FOR 
AUTOMATIC  ANALYS IS  
Ferenc  K ie fer  
The KVAL-approach  to syntact i c  ana lys i s  has  been  based  
on categor ia l  g rammar  as  propounded by Bar -H i l l e l  and Lambek.  
It was  c lear  at the very  outset  that the or ig ina l  fo rm of ca tegor ia l  
g rammar  is  not su i tab le  fo r  the purpose  of automat i zed  syntact i c  
ana lys i s  in p ract i ce .  The f i r s t  a t tempts  at deve lop ing  a more  
adequate  notat ion  as  wel l  as  at the c loser  examinat ion  of var ious  
proper t ies  of ca tegor ia l  g rammar  go back  to 1965 and 1966 
/KVAL  PM Z37, 248, 298, 302/ .  In o rder  to d i s t ingu ish  our  
approach  f rom or ig ina l  ca tegor ica l  g rammar  we have  te rmed it 
slant g rammar  calculus. 
Our  practical concern has been to write a grammar  for 
Swedish nominal phrases which would enable us to automatize 
some linguistic aspects of documentation research. Such a gram-  
mar  has been compiled by Bengt Svensson. The rules utilize 
lexical andd morphological information. In other words, no strict 
line is d rawn between morphological and syntactic rules. A sub- 
stantial part of this preliminary grammar  has already been 
checked generatively by means  of a special string processing 
a lgor i thm /STR IP / .  
As  known one of the most  tedious prob lems in connect ion 
with  categor ia l  g rammar  is  the great  number  of categor ies  
ass ignab le  to most  "of the un i ts  in  the s t r ing  to be ana lyzed .  Th is  
is  a par  exce l lence  :p ract i ca l  p rob lem but i t  does  not  lack  theor -  
e t i ca l  imp l i ca t ions .  The most  in teres t ing  of these  can  be rough ly  
phrased  as  fo l lows :  If syntax  is  to be kept  as  s imp le  as  poss ib le ,  
then  the lex icon  wi l l  get  compl i ca ted .  If we a im at  the opt ima l  
s imp l i f i ca t ion  of the lex icon ,  then  the burden  of our  g rammar  
wi l l  be taken  over  by  syntax .  (Reca l l  that  in  categor ia l  g rammar  
we have  on ly two ru les  fo r  the b id i rec t iona l  case .  There fore ,  a l l  
poss ib le  syntact i c  funct ions  fo r  each  lex ica l  ent ry  must  be l i s ted  
in the lex icon . )  Now we may ask  quest ions  about  the opt ima l  
d i s t r ibut ion  of tasks  of a g rammar  between syntax  and lex icon  in 
o rder  to ach ieve  an overa l l  s imp l i f i ca t ion  in g rammat ica l  descr ip -  
t ion.  (Not i ce  that  the same quest ion  can  be asked  wi th  respect  to 
syntax  and semant ics ,  or  st i l l  bet te r ,  w i th  respect  to syntax ,  se -  
mant ics  and the lex icon . )  Th is  p rob lem has ,  of course ,  not  yet  
been  so lved  and consequent ly ,  one is  fo rced  to work  in genera l  
w i th  severa l  a l te rnat ives .  
On the o ther  hand,  one can neg lec t  th i s  theoret i ca l  i ssue  
P 
and concent ra te  on s t ra teg ies  that  would lead  to an essent ia l  re -  
duct ion  of the poss ib le  ambigu i t ies  fo r  a g iven  s t r ing .  Some pro -  
posa ls  to th is  e f fec t  can be found in KVALPM 327 and 373. One 
of these  s t ra teg ies  fo l lows  the usua l  path :  the po int  i s  being made 
that  the  es tab l i shment  of  the  cor rec t  syntact i c  s t ruc ture  /o r  s t ruc -  
tu res /  shou ld  be  car r ied  out  in  severa l  /a t  leas t  two/  s teps .  
Thus ,  ins tead  of  hav ing  ru les  of  the  fo rm 
a/b  b -~ a 
/i/ 
a a \b  -~ b 
we wr i te  ru les  l i ke  
/Z /  x o y -~ z 
wh ich  may mean either 
Z/X  X -~ Z 
or  
X X\  Z -* Z 
i n / z /  we neglect the dominance relation / see  below/ hold- 
ing between the  two  const i tuents  and  a l so  the i r  l i near  o rder .  For  
the  la t te r  po in t  not i ce  that  /Z /  cor responds  to  two  phrase  s t ruc ture -  
type  ru les :  
z ~ a+b 
/3 /  
z ~ b + a 
where  + s tands  fo r  concatenat ion .  
As  to  the  dominance  re la t ion  i t  s tands  to  reason  to in terpret  
z /x  in  a s t r ing  z /x  x as  be ing  the  head  or  governor  of  the  cons -  
t ruc t ion .  S imi la r ly ,  fo r  a s t r ing  x x \ z we  wou ld  say  that  x 
i s  governed  by  x I z .  In  v iew of  the  way  the  cance l la t ion  ru les  of  
the  s lant  g r&mmar  ca lcu lus  a re  bu i l t  up  we may say  that  the  
"more  complex"  or  " longer"  category  i s  the governor  of a g iven  
express ion .  Th is  in fo rmat ion  is  c lear ly  los t  in  /2 / .  
However ,  as  spec i f ied  in In ter im Repor t  No | I ,  we are  not  
forced to make  this interpretation. The slant calculus as such 
l ends  i t se l f  to phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  too, context - f ree  or  
context -  sens i t i ve .  
Instead of / l /  our g rammar  would now contain a set of 
s ta tements  of the fo rm /Z / :  
a I o b I = c 1 
/4 /  a z o b z : c z 
, . *  
a o b c n n n 
Each  s ta tement  in /4/ cor responds  to a syntagm type in the g iven  
grammar .  Of course ,  i t  i s  not  necessary  to have  b inary  ru les  
only .  One might  a l so  have  
a I o a 2 o . . .  am = c l  
e tc  
Now a s t r ing  of ca tegor ies  in  te rms of our  s lant  g rammar  
ca lcu lus  can  cance l  to a "s imp ler"  ca tegory  if, and on ly  if,  one of  
the ru le  schemata  in /4 /  ho lds .  But  ~t se t  of such  schemata  wi l l  
y ie ld  many d i f fe rent  categor ia l  g rammars ,  vary ing  as  to the in ter -  
p re ta t ion  of dependency ,  
With the he lp  of /4 /  one can determine  a sor t  of "deep"  
s t ruc ture  fo r  a g iven  sequence  of morphemes .  
4 
Af ter  hav ing determined  th is  deep  s t ruc ture  we can proceed 
by f ind ing out more  about  the actua l  s t ruc ture .  
Another  approach  cons is ts  of combin ing  the a forement ioned  
mul t i - l eve l  method  with probab i l i s t i c  cons iderat ions .  For  deta i l s  
see  KVAL  In ter im Repor t  No 12. 
S ince  we have in terpreted  categor ies  in te rms of dependenc ies  
it is  read i ly  seen  that s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  can be cons idered  
as a dependency- type  grammar .  The dependency  s ta tement  fo r  the 
ru les  /1 /  can be rendered  as  /5 / :  
a/b (~ \[b\]). 
a\b  ( \ [a \ ]  x )  
We fu l ly  subscr ibe  to the v iew that  the determinat ion  of the 
head  or  governor  of a const ruct ion  is  an impor tant  and ind ispensab le  
task .  /See ,  a lso ,  Jane  Rob inson/  There fore ,  we think that  depend-  
ency  grammar  in whatever  notat iona l  convent ions  it is  expressed ,  
is  super io r  to phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar .  Jane  Rob inson  has  ar -  
gued that  many t rans format ions  need  a re ference  to the head  of 
const ruct ion  wh ich  in usua l  phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  can only  be 
Prov ided  by some ad hoc dev ice .  Al l  cons iderat ions  wi th  respect  to 
dependency  grammar  hold  wi th  equal  fo rce  wi th  respect  to s lant  
grammar  calculus. The  latter can be used as a base for transform- 
ations in the same way as dependency grammar  can. Following 
Robinson we may make use of the following notational concentions 
that differentiate dependency structures f rom phrase structures: 
we  may use asterisks to mark  governing occurrences, parentheses 
to mark  boundaries and a special pair of symbols /labels/, de- 
noting a variable depth of nesting. For  example, 
(A* B ~() => 2 I 3 
1 2 3 
. In o ther  words ,  the t rans format ion  rule app l ies  to a fami ly  of 
t rees  w i th  the s t ruc ture  
A 
/ 
e /~, \  X i S`` . 
/" ", / s  ? / s  "~ 
and as a result we  get a family with the structure 
A 
I S ? / ~. / ? 
/Robinson, op. cit. pp. 26-27/. 
It is now of little importance what the symbols A, B and X 
denote, i.e. whether they denote categories characteristic of depend- 
ency grammar  or of slant g rammar  calculus. We can thus conceive 
of a grammar  that has as its base /"categorial component" /  a de- 
pendency-tTpe grammar  which is context-free and a transformational 
component  that operates on structures generated by  the categorial 
- - - - .  . " . .  
component .  In th is  case  we can expect  f rom s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  
a notat iona l  advantage  at best .  
In fact ,  th is  seems to be the case .  Thus ,  in  many cases  
one can take advantage  of the resemblance  between categor ies  of 
the s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  and ord inary  f rac t ions .  Under  cer ta in  
cond i t ions  we can determine  the type of syntagm by ass ign ing  to 
each  symbo l  in the sequence  of ca tegor ies  a pr ime number  and 
then car ry  out the cance l la t ion  in an ar i thmet ica l  sense .  Then,  
sequences  of ca tegory  symbo ls  in  the s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  can 
eas i ly  be hand led  wi thout  any  re ference  to the i r  mean ings .  Severa l  
p roposa ls  have  been  worked  out that  take advantage  of exact ly  
th is  t ra i t  /KVAL  PM 367/ .  One de f inement  i s  p roposed  in In ter im 
Repor t  5, where  re la t ive ly  p r ime 2 x Z matr ixes  wi th  in teger  e le -  
ments  a re  ass igned  to the a toms of any  categor ia l  g rammar ,  so 
that  a s t r ing  is  g rammat ica l  if, and only  if, the product  of the 
ass igned  matr ixes  i s  equal  to some "un i t " .  
On the o ther  hand,  we may ask  to what  extent  t rans forma-  
t iona l  ru les  a re  rea l ly  necessary  fo r  our  purpose .  Could they  not 
a l l  be rep laced  by context -sens i t i ve  ru les?  Th is  p rob lem has  been  
examined in some deta i l  in In ter im Repor t  i f .  Another  k ind of 
ca tegor ia l  symbo ls ,  w i th  se lec tors  as  we l l  as  numerators  and de-  
nominators  and the cance l la t ion  ru le  /5 /  were  proposed  in o rder  
to cover  the context -sens i t i ve  case  ins tead  of / l / :  
x lly y-x  y 
151 
y Y l lx  - .y  x 
and in "mixed"  cases: 
/6/ u z z ullxlyllv V y -~ U X V 
Some fo rmal  quest ions  concern ing  the var ious  grammars  in 
the f ramework  of s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  have  been  tack led  in 
H. Kar lg ren :  Mu l t i - index  Syntact i c  Ca lcu lus .  
So fa r  it i s  not c lear  whether  ru les  of type /5 /  o r  /6 /  wi l l  
so lve  a l l  our  p rob lems.  But  i t  i s  in th is  d i rec t ion  that  we want  
to work  next .
