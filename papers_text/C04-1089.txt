Abstract 
New words such as names, technical terms, 
etc appear frequently. As such, the bilingual 
lexicon of a machine translation system has 
to be constantly updated with these new word 
translations. Comparable corpora such as 
news documents of the same period from dif-
ferent news agencies are readily available. In 
this paper, we present a new approach to min-
ing new word translations from comparable 
corpora, by using context information to 
complement transliteration information. We 
evaluated our approach on six months of Chi-
nese and English Gigaword corpora, with en-
couraging results. 
1. Introduction 
New words such as person names, organization 
names, technical terms, etc. appear frequently. In 
order for a machine translation system to trans-
late these new words correctly, its bilingual lexi-
con needs to be constantly updated with new 
word translations. 
Much research has been done on using parallel 
corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 
1997; Moore, 2003). But parallel corpora are 
scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan-
guage pairs. Comparable corpora refer to texts 
that are not direct translation but are about the 
same topic. For example, various news agencies 
report major world events in different languages, 
and such news documents form a readily avail-
able source of comparable corpora. Being more 
readily available, comparable corpora are thus 
more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of 
acquiring new word translations, although rela-
tively less research has been done in the past on 
comparable corpora. Previous research efforts on 
acquiring translations from comparable corpora 
include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 
1999). 
When translating a word w, two sources of in-
formation can be used to determine its transla-
tion: the word w itself and the surrounding words 
in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w. Most 
previous research only considers one of the two 
sources of information, but not both. For exam-
ple, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; 
Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and 
Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in 
translation. On the other hand, the work of (Cao 
and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and 
Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the 
context of w to locate its translation in a second 
language. 
In this paper, we propose a new approach for 
the task of mining new word translations from 
comparable corpora, by combining both context 
and transliteration information. Since both 
sources of information are complementary, the 
accuracy of our combined approach is better than 
the accuracy of using just context or translitera-
tion information alone. We fully implemented 
our method and tested it on Chinese-English 
comparable corpora. We translated Chinese 
words into English. That is, Chinese is the source 
language and English is the target language. We 
achieved encouraging results. 
While we have only tested our method on Chi-
nese-English comparable corpora, our method is 
general and applicable to other language pairs. 
2. Our approach 
The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; 
Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e  is 
the translation of a Chinese word c , then the 
contexts of the two words are similar. We could 
view this as a document retrieval problem. The 
context (i.e., the surrounding words) of c  is 
viewed as a query. The context of each candidate 
translation 'e  is viewed as a document. Since the 
context of the correct translation e  is similar to 
the context of c , we are likely to retrieve the 
context of e  when we use the context of c  as 
the query and try to retrieve the most similar 
document. We employ the language modeling 
approach (Ng, 2000; Ponte and Croft, 1998) for 
this retrieval problem. More details are given in 
Section 3. 
On the other hand, when we only look at the 
word w itself, we can rely on the pronunciation 
of w to locate its translation. We use a variant of 
the machine transliteration method proposed by 
(Knight and Graehl, 1998). More details are 
given in Section 4. 
Each of the two individual methods provides a 
ranked list of candidate words, associating with 
each candidate a score estimated by the particular 
method. If a word e  in English is indeed the 
translation of a word c  in Chinese, then we 
would expect e  to be ranked very high in both 
lists in general. Specifically, our combination 
method is as follows: we examine the top M  
words in both lists and find keee ,...,, 21 that ap-
pear in top M positions in both lists. We then 
rank these words keee ,...,, 21  according to the 
average of their rank positions in the two lists. 
The candidate ei that is ranked the highest ac-
cording to the average rank is taken to be the cor-
rect translation and is output. If no words appear 
within the top M positions in both lists, then no 
translation is output.  
Since we are using comparable corpora, it is 
possible that the translation of a new word does 
not exist in the target corpus. In particular, our 
experiment was conducted on comparable cor-
pora that are not very closely related and as such, 
most of the Chinese words have no translations 
in the English target corpus. 
3. Translation by context 
In a typical information retrieval (IR) problem, a 
query is given and a ranked list of documents 
most relevant to the query is returned from a 
document collection. 
For our task, the query is )(cC , the context 
(i.e., the surrounding words) of a Chinese word 
c . Each )(eC , the context of an English word 
e , is considered as a document in IR. If an Eng-
lish word e  is the translation of a Chinese word 
c , they will have similar contexts. So we use the 
query )(cC  to retrieve a document )( *eC  that 
best matches the query. The English word *e  
corresponding to that document )( *eC  is the 
translation of c . 
Within IR, there is a new approach to docu-
ment retrieval called the language modeling ap-
proach (Ponte & Croft, 98). In this approach, a 
language model is derived from each document 
D . Then the probability of generating the query 
Q  according to that language model, )|( DQP , 
is estimated. The document with the highest 
)|( DQP  is the one that best matches the query. 
The language modeling approach to IR has been 
shown to give superior retrieval performance 
(Ponte & Croft, 98; Ng, 2000), compared with 
traditional vector space model, and we adopt this 
approach in our current work. 
To estimate )|( DQP , we use the approach of 
(Ng, 2000). We view the document D as a mul-
tinomial distribution of terms and assume that 
query Q  is generated by this model: 
??= t
c
t t
tDtPnDQP
c
)|(
!
!)|(  
where t  is a term in the corpus, tc  is the number 
of times term t  occurs in the query Q ,  
?= t tcn is the total number of terms in query 
Q . 
For ranking purpose, the first fraction 
?t tcn !/!  can be omitted as this part depends on 
the query only and thus is the same for all the 
documents. 
In our translation problem, )(cC  is viewed as 
the query and )(eC  is viewed as a document. So 
our task is to compute ))(|)(( eCcCP for each 
English word e  and find the e  that gives the 
highest ))(|)(( eCcCP , estimated as: 
?

lingual dictionary. If an English word is ambigu-
ous and has K translated Chinese words listed in

lated Chinese words is counted as occurring 1/K

mated similarly by counting the occurrences of 
ct  in the Chinese translation of the whole Eng-
lish corpus. ?  is set to 0.6 in our experiments. 
4. Translation by transliteration 
For the transliteration model, we use a modified 
model of (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and (Al-
Onaizan and Knight, 2002b). 
Knight and Graehl (1998) proposed a prob-
abilistic model for machine transliteration. In this 
model, a word in the target language (i.e., Eng-
lish in our task) is written and pronounced. This 
pronunciation is converted to source language 
pronunciation and then to source language word 
(i.e., Chinese in our task). Al-Onaizan and 
Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can 
be skipped and the target language letters can be 
mapped directly to source language letters. 
Pinyin is the standard Romanization system of 
Chinese characters. It is phonetic-based. For 
transliteration, we estimate )|( ceP as follows: 
??
?
=
=
=
a i
i
a
i
a
plP
pinyinaeP
pinyinePceP
)|(
)|,(
)|()|(
 
First, each Chinese character in a Chinese 
word c is converted to pinyin form. Then we sum 
over all the alignments that this pinyin form of c 
can map to an English word e. For each possible 
alignment, we calculate the probability by taking 
the product of each mapping. ip  is the ith sylla-
ble of pinyin, ail  is the English letter sequence 
that the ith pinyin syllable maps to in the particu-
lar alignment a. 
Since most Chinese characters have only one 
pronunciation and hence one pinyin form, we 
assume that Chinese character-to-pinyin mapping 
is one-to-one to simplify the problem. We use the 
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to 
generate mapping probabilities from pinyin syl-
lables to English letter sequences. To reduce the 
search space, we limit the number of English 
letters that each pinyin syllable can map to as 0, 
1, or 2. Also we do not allow cross mappings. 
That is, if an English letter sequence 1e  precedes 
another English letter sequence 2e in an English 
word, then the pinyin syllable mapped to 1e  
must precede the pinyin syllable mapped to 2e . 
Our method differs from (Knight and Graehl, 
1998) and (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) in 
that our method does not generate candidates but 
only estimates )|( ceP for candidates e appear-
ing in the English corpus. Another difference is 
that our method estimates )|( ceP  directly, in-
stead of )|( ecP  and )(eP . 
5. Experiment 
5.1  Resources 
For the Chinese corpus, we used the Linguistic 
Data Consortium (LDC) Chinese Gigaword Cor-
pus from Jan 1995 to Dec 1995. The corpus of 
the period Jul to Dec 1995 was used to come up 
with new Chinese words c for translation into 
English. The corpus of the period Jan to Jun 
1995 was just used to determine if a Chinese 
word c from Jul to Dec 1995 was new, i.e., not 
occurring from Jan to Jun 1995. Chinese Giga-
word corpus consists of news from two agencies: 
Xinhua News Agency and Central News Agency. 
As for English corpus, we used the LDC Eng-
lish Gigaword Corpus from Jul to Dec 1995. The 
English Gigaword corpus consists of news from 
four newswire services: Agence France Press 
English Service, Associated Press Worldstream 
English Service, New York Times Newswire 
Service, and Xinhua News Agency English Ser-
vice. To avoid accidentally using parallel texts, 
we did not use the texts of Xinhua News Agency 
English Service. 
The size of the English corpus from Jul to Dec 
1995 was about 730M bytes, and the size of the 
Chinese corpus from Jul to Dec 1995 was about 
120M bytes. 
We used a Chinese-English dictionary which 
contained about 10,000 entries for translating the 
words in the context. For the training of translit-
eration probability, we required a Chinese-
English name list. We used a list of 1,580 Chi-
nese-English name pairs as training data for the 
EM algorithm. 
5.2 Preprocessing 
Unlike English, Chinese text is composed of 
Chinese characters with no demarcation for 
words. So we first segmented Chinese text with a 
Chinese word segmenter that was based on 
maximum entropy modeling (Ng and Low, 
2004). 
We then divided the Chinese corpus from Jul 
to Dec 1995 into 12 periods, each containing text 
from a half-month period. Then we determined 
the new Chinese words in each half-month pe-
riod p. By new Chinese words, we refer to those 
words that appeared in this period p but not from 
Jan to Jun 1995 or any other periods that pre-
ceded p. Among all these new words, we se-
lected those occurring at least 5 times. These 
words made up our test set. We call these words 
Chinese source words. They were the words that 
we were supposed to find translations from the 
English corpus. 
For the English corpus, we performed sen-
tence segmentation and converted each word to 
its morphological root form and to lower case. 
We also divided the English corpus into 12 pe-
riods, each containing text from a half-month 
period. For each period, we selected those Eng-
lish words occurring at least 10 times and were 
not present in the 10,000-word Chinese-English 
dictionary we used and were not stop words. We 
considered these English words as potential 
translations of the Chinese source words. We call 
them English translation candidate words. For a 
Chinese source word occurring within a half-
month period p, we looked for its English trans-
lation candidate words occurring in news docu-
ments in the same period p. 
5.3 Translation candidates 
The context )(cC  of a Chinese word c was col-
lected as follows: For each occurrence of c, we 
set a window of size 50 characters centered at c. 
We discarded all the Chinese words in the con-
text that were not in the dictionary we used. The 
contexts of all occurrences of a word c were then 
concatenated together to form )(cC . The context 
of an English translation candidate word e, 
)(eC , was similarly collected. The window size 
of English context was 100 words. 
After all the counts were collected, we esti-
mated ))(|)(( eCcCP  as described in Section 3, 
for each pair of Chinese source word and English 
translation candidate word. For each Chinese 
source word, we ranked all its English translation 
candidate words according to the esti-
mated ))(|)(( eCcCP . 
For each Chinese source word c  and an Eng-
lish translation candidate word e , we also calcu-
lated the probability )|( ceP  (as described in 
Section 4), which was used to rank the English 
candidate words based on transliteration. 
Finally, the English candidate word with the 
smallest average rank position and that appears 
within the top M positions of both ranked lists is 
the chosen English translation (as described in 
Section 2). If no words appear within the top M 
positions in both ranked lists, then no translation 
is output. 
Note that for many Chinese words, only one 
English word e  appeared within the top M posi-
tions for both lists. And among those cases where 
more than one English words appeared within the 
top M positions for both lists, many were multi-
ple translations of a Chinese word. This hap-
pened for example when a Chinese word was a 
non-English person name. The name could have 
multiple translations in English. For example, 
???? was a Russian name. Mirochina and 
Miroshina both appeared in top 10 positions of 
both lists. Both were correct. 
5.4 Evaluation 
We evaluated our method on each of the 12 half-
month periods. The results when we set M = 10 
are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Accuracy of our system in each period (M = 
10) 
 
In Table 1, period 1 is Jul 01 ? Jul 15, period 2 
is Jul 16 ? Jul 31, ?, period 12 is Dec 16 ? Dec 
31. #c is the total number of new Chinese source 
words in the period. #e is the total number of 
English translation candidates in the period. #o is 
the total number of output English translations. 
#Cor is the number of correct English transla-
tions output. Prec. is the precision. The correct-
ness of the English translations was manually 
checked. 
Recall is somewhat difficult to estimate be-
cause we do not know whether the English trans-
lation of a Chinese word appears in the English 
part of the corpus. We attempted to estimate re-
call by manually finding the English translations 
for all the Chinese source words for the two peri-
ods Dec 01 ? Dec 15 and Dec 16 ? Dec 31 in the 
English part of the corpus. During the whole De-
cember period, we only managed to find English 
translations which were present in the English 
side of the comparable corpora for 43 Chinese 
words. So we estimate that English translations 
are present in the English part of the corpus for  
3624499)205329(43 =?+  words in all 12 pe-
riods. And our program finds correct translations 
for 115 words. So we estimate that recall (for M 
= 10) is approximately %8.31362/115 = . 
We also investigated the effect of varying M . 
The results are shown in Table 2.

The past research of (Fung and Yee, 1998; 
Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) utilized context infor-
mation alone and was evaluated on different cor-
pora from ours, so it is difficult to directly 
compare our current results with theirs. Simi-
larly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) 
only made use of transliteration information 
alone and so was not directly comparable. 
To investigate the effect of the two individual 
sources of information (context and translitera-
tion), we checked how many translations could 
be found using only one source of information 
(i.e., context alone or transliteration alone), on 
those Chinese words that have translations in the 
English part of the comparable corpus. As men-
tioned earlier, for the month of Dec 1995, there 
are altogether 43 Chinese words that have their 
translations in the English part of the corpus. 
This list of 43 words is shown in Table 3. 8 of 
the 43 words are translated to English multi-word 
phrases (denoted as ?phrase? in Table 3). Since 
our method currently only considers unigram 
English words, we are not able to find transla-
tions for these words. But it is not difficult to 
extend our method to handle this problem. We 
can first use a named entity recognizer and noun 
phrase chunker to extract English names and 
noun phrases. 
The translations of 6 of the 43 words are 
words in the dictionary (denoted as ?comm.? in 
Table 3) and 4 of the 43 words appear less than 
10 times in the English part of the corpus (de-
noted as ?insuff?). Our method is not able to find 
these translations. But this is due to search space 
pruning. If we are willing to spend more time on 
searching, then in principle we can find these 
translations.

Table 3. Rank of correct translation for period Dec 01 
?   Dec 15 and Dec 16 ? Dec 31. ?Cont. rank? is the 
context rank, ?Trans. Rank? is the transliteration rank. 
?NA? means the word cannot be transliterated. ?insuff?

?comm? means the correct translation is a word ap-
pearing in the dictionary we used or is a stop word.

ple English words. 
 
As shown in Table 3, using just context infor-
mation alone, 10 Chinese words (the first 10) 
have their correct English translations at rank one 
position. And using just transliteration informa-
tion alone, 9 Chinese words have their correct 
English translations at rank one position. 
On the other hand, using our method of com-
bining both sources of information and setting M 
= ?, 19 Chinese words (i.e., the first 22 Chinese 
words in Table 3 except ???,??,???) 
have their correct English translations at rank one 
position. If M = 10, 15 Chinese words (i.e., the 
first 19 Chinese words in Table 3 except 
???,???,??,???) have their correct 
English translations at rank one position. Hence, 
our method of using both sources of information 
outperforms using either information source 
alone. 
6. Related work 
As pointed out earlier, most previous research 
only considers either transliteration or context 
information in determining the translation of a 
source language word w, but not both sources of 
information. For example, the work of (Al-
Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and 
Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used 
only the pronunciation or spelling of w in transla-
tion. On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 
2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 
1999) used only the context of w to locate its 
translation in a second language. In contrast, our 
current work attempts to combine both comple-
mentary sources of information, yielding higher 
accuracy than using either source of information 
alone. 
Koehn and Knight (2002) attempted to com-
bine multiple clues, including similar context and 
spelling. But their similar spelling clue uses the 
longest common subsequence ratio and works 
only for cognates (words with a very similar 
spelling). 
The work that is most similar to ours is the re-
cent research of (Huang et al, 2004). They at-
tempted to improve named entity translation by 
combining phonetic and semantic information. 
Their contextual semantic similarity model is 
different from our language modeling approach 
to measuring context similarity. It also made use 
of part-of-speech tag information, whereas our 
method is simpler and does not require part-of-
speech tagging. They combined the two sources 
of information by weighting the two individual 
scores, whereas we made use of the average rank 
for combination. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we proposed a new method to mine 
new word translations from comparable corpora, 
by combining context and transliteration infor-
mation, which are complementary sources of 
information. We evaluated our approach on six 
months of Chinese and English Gigaword cor-
pora, with encouraging results.
