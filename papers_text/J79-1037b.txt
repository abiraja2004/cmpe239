' 'Semantics: Theory and Application' ' 
March 11 ,  12,  13, 1976 
The theme of the Georgetown University on Thursday evening, on Friday mcr.rine and after- 
Round Table on Languages and Linguistics 1976 noon, and on Saturday morning, March 1 I -?  3 On 
is semantics. There will br two types of meetings: Friday esening. Georgetown University will hast a 
(1 ) fourtcen Interest Group Sessions on Thursday budet reception for those attending the Round Table. 
afternoon, March 1 1; and ( 2 ) four Plenary Sessions 
The Interest Group Sessions will provide an oppor- 
tunicy for informal discussion of various related topics. 
These sessions will be chaired and their topics wjli be in- 
troduced by scholars in the various fields. A limit of 25 
participants for each Group should provide a manageable 
interchange of iieas. Acceptance for each group will depend 
on early preregistratim. On the form below participants 
should indicate their preferred Interest Group and list any 
speciiic topic they desire d i d .  Those not registering 
until the Round Table itself cannot be guaranteed par- 
ricipacion in an Interest Group. 
The Plenary Sessions will explore the relationship of 
semantics to various theoretical viewpoints in  linguistics, 
to problems in applied linguistics and to problems in 
language teaching. The Plenary Sessions will also discuss the 
relationships of semantics to anthropology, computer sci- 
ence, philosophy, and psychology.

THE PERISHING PUBLISHING PROSPECT FOR SCIENTIFIC AUTHORS 
Economics and a resourceful technology are  eroding the comfor- 
table system by which post-World War I1 scientists have gained 
credit  for  results of their  research. Existing arrangements 
for ci ta t ion and indexing for reference and retrieval are simi- 
l a r ly  threatened. This Symposium will attempt t o  a le r t  scien- 
tific authors to trends, opportunities, and dangers they must 
face in the next decade, as foreseen by knowledgable communica- 
t o r s  with experties and occupational mandates to define and 
pred ic t  the future. Emphasis in a l l  presentations will be on 
the impact of imminent changes on individual authors rather than 
on specialized problems in technical and scientific information

SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE 
Information is both the input of raw rraterial and the output of 
scientific and engineering activities. Comunica.tions services 
are the means by which scientists and engineers are able to 
b u i l d  upon the results of p r i o r  work even though that work may 
have been done at a distant place or in a different discipline. 
Many prestigious committees and study groups have analyzed the 
information problems of scientists and engineers and offered a 
broad range of recommendations for improvement. But very little 
has changed. This symposium will review the problems with, and 
needs for, co~unications services by the scientific community 
and suggest new approaches to the problem of maintaining an eco- 
nomically viable and user responsive scientific and technical 
comunications enterprise in the U.S. Speakers will deal with 
a variety of specific questions including: What is the role of 
information in science and engineering? How much progress have 
w e  made in improving information services during the last 10 
years? What are the current problems in financial support, or- 
ganization, and management of the scientific communication enter- 
prise? What can be done to improve the extisting situation and 
enhance the value of scientific and technical information ser- 
vices to users engaged in scientific research?

COMPUTERS AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: EXTENDING THE AVAILABILITY 
AND USE OF KNOWLEDGE I N  MEDICINE 
The symposium explores new directions of development extending 
the use of medical knowledge via c~mputer-based systems. In 
one category of such systems, knowledge is extracted automati- 
cally from the aggregate of patient records (medical data banks); 
another category encapsulates and makes available decision 
making rules of human experts. The program describes the cur- 
rent state of the art in the development of these systems; 
reviews research i n  the modeling of clinical decision processes; 
examines the implications of computer-aided consulting on medi- 
cal practice and education; and surveys Federal programs which 
support the training of manpower f o r  biomedical information pro-

Stokoe (1960) has des igned  a model of the structure of the 
American Sign Language (ASL) which is amenable to computer si- 
mulation. He has proposed that signs comprising the ASL lexi- 
con are composed of three basic aspects, location (TAB), hand 
configuration I (DEZ) , and movement (SIG) . He has identified a 
finite number of each of these elements, and he has proposed 
that they may be combined in various ways to constitute recog- 
nizable and meaningful signs. Recent reformulations have ven- 
t u r ed  some modifications ( e . g . ,  Stokoe, 1972), but the basic 
approach remains the same. 
Such a conceptualization of ASL implies that if a computer were 
furnished a set of each of these types of elements, it ought  to

be able t o  compile t h e  signs that are composed of the features 
in its r e p e r t o i r e  I t  needs t o  be emphasized that such a com- 
pute r  s imula t ion  i s  not  mere ly  a matter of car tooning,  a l though  
t h i s  l i e s  w i t h i n  the c a p a b i l i t y  of computer g r aph i c s  t o  p o r t r a y .  
METHOD 
APPARATUS. Our principal apparatus was an Owens-Illinois 
Digivue Plasma Display Unit attached to a Nova 1220 minicomputer 
The Digivue Display Unit is an electronic device with a gas- 
filled display matrix and activating circuitry. An electr ical  
signal is passed through each of two very f i n e  wires at right 
angles to one another .  When the gas is activated, it lights up 
at the poiat of intersection. There a r e  512 g r i d  lines in each 
d i r e c t i o n ,  making a t o t a l  of 262,144 addressable points. Points 
can be written or erased at the rate of 50,000 dots p e r  second. 
The program language used was Graphic Basic, a version of Data 
General Corporation's time-shared BASIC, modified for use wi th  
the Digivue Display Unit (Fulton, 1974). Access to the computer 
was gained through the Digivue keyboard and through a teletype- 
writer. Paper tape output from the teletypewriter provided 
permanent storage of previously written programs. 
PROCEDURE. AS a concession to storage limitations, t h e  p ro j ec t  
was, a t  f i r s t ,  limited to one-handed signs located on or near 
the face. An oval shape with stylized browline, nose, and 
mouth was stored in memory and served as the reference for any 
sign which the computer was r e q u i r e d  to generate  
Hand c o ~ ~ f i g u r a t i o n s  (DEZ) were constructed by jo in ing  coordinate 
p o i n t s  with line segments. The points were s t o r e d  in t h e  memory 
of t h e  computer, and g r a p h i c  commands were i s sued  t o  form t h e  
l i n e  segments. 
As a program was f ed  i n t o  the  computer, it s t o r e d  in memory in- 
formation about t h e  DEZ and t h e  initial TAB while t h e  face was 
drawn on the  screen. Another series of subroutines drew the  
DEZ in its initial TAB and moved it to another TAB so as t o  re- 
present a movement (SIG). I f  the sign required a change of DEZ,  
the program could call the new DEZ up from memory and place it 
in the sign's final p o s i t i o n .  
VALIDATION. The adequacy of the simulated signs rests with 
t h e i r  intelligibility. Deaf and hearing persons who were fluent 
users of ASL were t e s t e d  to verify that the  graphic  display 
y i e l d e d  signs t h a t  could be recognized as par t  of t h e  ASL lex icon.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Thus far 11 DEZ, 8 TABs, and 7 SIGs have been programed and 
s t o r e d  on a single paper tape.  I f  d i s c  storage and the necessary 
interface were added to our  Nova, it is likely t h a t  we could 
represent all 12 TABs, 19 DEZ, and 24 SIGs identified by Stokoe 
as primes  of his model. Meanwhile, the subset of structural 
features programed thus f a r  constitute a suitable feasibility 
study of a computer simulation of ASL. The following results 
have been achieved 
It has been ver i f ied  that t h e  features of ASL identified by 
Stokoe as structural elements may also function as distinctive 
features. The same DES and SIG executed with different TABs 
may result in signs with d i f f e r e n t  meanings ( f a t h e r  and mother, 
s u m m e r  and d r y  in our data). The same TAB and SIG executed with 
d i f f e r e n t  DEZ may a l so  result in signs with different meanings 
(who and lipread in our data). Finally, the same DEZ and TAB 
with di f fe ren t  SIGs may a l s o  result in signs with d i f f e ren t  
meanings (summer and w i s e ,  face and who in our data) . 
Secondly ,  i f  any one of these aspects (TAB, DEZ, or SIG) of a 
sign is altered, the resulting sign compiled by the computer is 
1) likely to be nonsense" in ASL. In our data, the 11 DEZ,  8 
TABs, and 7 SIGs yield potentially 11 x 8 x 7 or 616 signs. 
Over 600 of them are nonsense. This indicates that most signs 
in ASL differ from one a n o t h e r  i n  more than one distinctive fea- 
ture. Also, since many signs change DEZ and involve more than 
one SIG, there is a low probability of confusing one sign with 
another, even when the signs are presented out of con tex t .  
Finally, our data indicate that the orientation of the hands 
a l so  constitutes a distinctive feature i n  ASL. Inappropriate 
hand orientation can disrupt intelligibility even when the o the r  
three aspects are compiled correctly. Stokoe's model seems to 
be sufficiently robust t o  assimilate t h e  required revision with- 
out altering h i s  basic approach. 
This computer simulation of ASL was l i m i t e d  t o  t he  structural 
features o f  individual s i g n s ,  and it corresponds t o  a study of 
the  phonological structure of spoken languages. (Stokoe refers 
t o  h i s  analysis as CHEROLOGY a f t e r  the Greek chc i r  or  hand . )  No 
attempt was made in this simulation t o  present the signs in a 
linguistic context o r  to represent t h e  structure of A S  sentences 
Future studies are planned in which the graphic  d i ~ p l a y  o f  indi- 
vidual signs will be subject  t o  systematic distortion to discover 
whether TAB or SIG aspects of signs are perceived categorically 
by native users of ASL.

I In t roduc t ion  
In t h i s  paper we describe a new programming language which is designed 
to facilitate the writing of natural language grammars. A s i m p l e  structural 
analysis program using this language is given as an example. There are two 
key issues in analyzing natural language by computer: 1) how to represent 
knowledge (semantics, pragmatics) and t h e  state (context) of the  world, and 
2) how to advance the programming technology appropriate for syntactic- 
semantic, syntactic-contextual interface. The point in designing a programming 
language is  to make this kind of programming less painful. 
T r a d i  t i m a 1  systems whi.ch r e p r e s e n t  grammars as  a set  of rewrit ing 
rules ust ia l ly  'have poor c o n t r o l  mechanisms, and flexible in teract ion  between 
thc syntac t  LC and other con~ponents is not  possible. Systems in which rules  
o f  gr-;lnmlilrs . r l rc  cn11,i-dilcd i n  proccdrlrcs ,  an.  tllc other hand, make it p o s s i b l c  
to  i n t  t - r m i s  ttrct 6 yrltnc t 'lc and seniant i c  anaIyst?s  i n  an i r~t i innte  way. Llowcvcr, 
thest. systcos are apt. t . 0  c.lestroy the i n t c . l l i g i h : i l  ity and r e g u l a r i t y  o f  
natural  language gramars,  because i n  these systems both ru le s  and their 
control  mechanisms are contained i n  the same program. 
Recently various syscems for natural  language a n a l y s i s  have  been 
developed T .  Winograd's (1971) "PROGRAMMAR" i s  a typ ica l  example of 
procedure oriented systems. In this system the syntactic and other components 
can interact c l o s e l y  i n  the course of analyzing sentences.  However, d e t a i l s  
o f  the program are lost i n  the richness  o f  this in teract ion .  LINGOL, 
developed by V .  Pratt (1973) a t  MIT, is  a language appropriate to  syntax- 
semantics interface and in which it is easy t o  write grammars in t h e  form of 
rewriting r u l e s .  The TAUM group a t  Montreal University (1971)  has evolved a 
programming languagc name : I  System-Q in which expressions of t r e e s ,  strings 
and lists o f  them can be  matched against  p a r t i a l  expressions ( s t r u c t u r a l  
patterns) c o n t a i n i n g  variables and can be transformed i n  any a r b i t r a r y  
fast1 i 0 1 1 .  
Thc augmcn t c d  t r i111~ i L I o n  ilc twork (A1l'N) proposccl by W Woods (19 70) 
from our p o i n t  of view gives an e spec ia l l y  good framework for natural  
Xa~~guage a n a l y s i s  systems. One of- t h e  most attract ive  features is the  clear 
dtscrimination between grammatical rules and t h e  control mechanism. T h i s  
enables us t o  develop the  model by adding various f a c i l i t i e s  to  its control 
mechanism. 
The ATN model has the following additional merits :. 
30 
1. It prov ides  power of e x p r e s s i o n  equiva len t  t o  t r a n s f o r m a t i o n a l  
grammars 
2. I t  mai11tai .n~ much of the r e n d a b i l i t y  of context-free grammars. 
3 .  R u l e s  of n grammar can b e  changed easily, so we can improve them 
through a t r i a l - a n d - e r r o r  process whi1.e w r i t i n g  t h e  grammar. 
4. I t  i s  p o s s i b l e  t o  impose various types of semant ic  and pragmat ic  
c o n d i t i o n s  on the branches  between s ta tes .  By doing  this, c l o s e  i n t e r a c t i o n s  
between the s y n t a c t i c  and other components can be  e a s i l y  accomplished.  
However ATN h a s  the f o l l o w i n g  shor tcomings ,  e s p e c i a l l y  when we a p p l y  
i t  to the p a r s i n g  of Japanese s e n t e n c e s :  
1. It scans words one-by-one from the leftmost end of an input 
s e n t e n c e ,  checks t h e  a p p l i c a b i l i t y  of a r u l e ,  and makes t h e  t r a n s i t i o n  from 
one s t a t e  t o  ano the r .  This method may be  w e l l  s u i t e d  for Engl i sh  s e n t e n c e s ,  
but because  t h e  o r d e r  of words and p h r a s e s  i n  Japanese sen tences  is r e l a t i v e l y  
free, i t  is preferable t o  check t h e  a p p l i c a b i l i t y  o f  a r u l e  by a flexible 
pat te rn-matching  method. I n  a d d i t i o n ,  w i t h o u t  a p a t t e  rn-matching mechanism, 
a s ingle  rewriting ru le  of an o r d i n a r y  grammar i s  often to b e  expressed by 
several rules belonging to d i f f e r e n t  states i n  Woods ATN parser. 
2. An ATN model e s s e n t i a l l y  performs a k ind  of top-down analysls of 
s e n t e n c e s .  Therefore  recovery f ronl f a i l u r e s  in predic t f .on  is most d1.f f i c u l t .  
Consider ing these fac tors ,  w e  d e v e l o p e d  PLATON (a Programming 
Lhnguage f o r  Tree-Ol>cratioN), which is based  on the A1'N model and has v a r i o u s  
a d d i t i o n a l  c a p a b i l i t i e s  such as pattern-matching, f l e x i b l e  back t rack ing ,  and 
so  on. As in S y s t e w Q  and LINGOL, PLATON's pat tern-matching fac i l i ty  makes 
i t  e a s y  to write rewriting r u l e s .  Moreover, i t  extracts s u b s t r u c t u r e s  from 
the i n p u t s  and invokes a p p r o p r i a t e  semant ic  and  c o n t e x t u a l  checking func t ions .  
31 
These may be arbitrary LISP functions def ined  by t h e  user, the arguments of 
w h i ~ n  are the  extracted substructures.  
A backtracking mechanism is a l so  necessary for l a n g u ~ e  understanding 
as in other fields of a r t i f i c i a l  intelligence. During t h e  analysis, various 
sorts of h e u r i s t i c  information should be u t i l i z a b l e .  A t  any s tage ,  analysis 
based on criteria which may re la te  t o  syntactic, semantic or contextual 
considerat ions taken separately may be unre l iable .  The result which f u l f i l s  
all the criteria, however, w i l l  b e  a correct one. The program shou ld  b e  
designed such  that i t  can choose the most satisfactory rule from many 
cand ida te s  according t o  the criteria at hand. In further processing, i f  the 
choice i s  found to  b e  wrong by other criteria, the  program must be able to  
backtrack to  the p o i n t  at which the .relevant decision w a s  made. In PLATON 
we can e a s i l y  set  up arbitrary numbers of dec i s ion  po int s  in t h e  program. 
Then, i f  subsequent processing resu l t s  i n  some failure, control w i l l  come 
back t o  the points relevant t o  the cause of the f a i l u r e .  
11. Pattern-matching 
Before proceeding to  the detailed description of  PLATON, w e  w i l l  
explain the  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  schema for i n p u t  sentences and parsed trees. The 
process of analyzing a sentence, roughly speaking, may be regarded as the 
process of transforming an ordered list of words t o  a tree s tructure ,  which 
shows e x p l i c i t l y  the interrelationships of each word in the input  sentence. 
During the process, trees which correspond to the parts already analyzed, and 
1 h t s  which have not been processed y e t ,  may c o e x i s t  together i n  a s i n g l e  
s tructure .  We therefore wish to represent such a coexisting structure o f  
trees and lists. A l ist  structure is a s tructure  i n  which the order of element 
i s  not changeable. On the other hand, a tree structure cons i s t s  of a single 
root node and several nodes which are tied t o  the root node by d i s t inguishable  
re lat ions .  Because relations between the root and the  other nodes are 
e x p l i c i t l y  spec i f ied ,  t he  order  of nodes in a tree is changeable except for 
the root node which is placed in the leftmost posit ion.  Different matching 
schemas w i l l  be a p p l i e d  to  trees and lists. 
The formal definition of such coexisting structures is as f o l l o w s .  
<structure> i s  the fundamental data-structure into which a l l  data processed 
by PLATON must be transformed. Hereafter we refer to  this  as the "structure" 
The formal definition of <structure) is: 
(list) ::= ($ ts tructures> ) 
(structures> : := 1 <structure> ( structures > 
<tree> : := ( node, I ( (node) < branches) ) 
<branches> : := (brancl~) 1 (branch, branches ) 
(branch) ::= ( < r e l a t i o n >  (tree, ) 
( node, : := C l i s  t > I !UBITRARY LISP-ATOM 
< relation > : := ARBITRARY LISP-ATOM 
A simple example is shown in Figure 1.

Two lists which have the same elements but dif ferent  orderings (for example, 
( X  A B C) and ($ A C B)) , should be regarded as different structures.  On 
the other hand, two tree structures such  as ( A ( R1 B ) ( R2 C ) )  and 
( A ( R2 C ) (  R1 B ) )  are regarded as i d e n t i c a l .  Besides the usual rewrite 
rules which treat such s tr ings ,  s tructural patterns  which contain variable 
expressions are permitted in PLATON. The PLATON-interpreter matches 
structural patterns containing variable expressions against the structure 
under process and  checks whether the s p e c i f i e d  p a t t e r n  is found in it. At 
the same time, the variables in the pattern are bound t o  the corresponding 
subs tructurzs . 
Variables  i n  patterns are indicated as :X (X i s  an arbitrary LISP 
atom). The following can be expressed by variables in the above definition 
(1) arbitrary numbers of < structures> , that i s  to say, l i s t  elements in 
the definition of < list > (Figure  2, Ex. 1). We can also specify the

variable several times i n  a p a t t e r n ,  we can express a structure i n  which  t he

111 Basic Operat ions  of PLATON 
A grammar, whether gene ra t ive  o r  a n a l y t i c a l .  is represen ted  as a 
d i r e c t e d  graph with labeled states  and branches. There is one state d i s  tin- 
guished as the Start State  and a s e t  of sta tes  called F i n a l  States.  Each 
branch is a rewriting r u l e  and has the fol lowing elements: 
(1) applicability condi t ions  of t h e  rule, typical ly  represen ted  as 
a  structural p a t t e r n  
(2)  a c t i o n s  which must be executed, i f  the r u l e  is a p p l i c a b l e  
(3) a s t r u c t u r a l  pa t tern  i n t o  which the i n p u t  s t r u c t u r e  should  be  
t ransformed.  
Each s ta te  has  several branches ordered according t o  the preference  of tho 
rules. When the control jumps to  a state ,  i t  checks t h e  rules associated 
with the state  one-by-one until it finds an appl i cab le  rule. If such a rule 
is found, the i n p u t  s t r u c t u r e  is transformed i n t o  another  s t r u c t u r e  s p e c i f i e d  
by t h e  r u l e  and the control makes the s t a t e  t r a n s i t i o n .  
35 
In addit ion to  the above basic mechanism t h e  system i s  provided with 
push-down and pop-up operations. The push-down operat ion  is such that i n  t h e  
process of a p p l y i n g  a rule ,  several substructures  are extracted from the 
whole s t r u c t u r e  by v a r i a b l e  binding mechanisms of pattern-matching. Then each 
i s  analyzed from a dif ferent  state. The pop-up operation i s  such that after 
each substructure i s  analyzed appropriately, control comes back to the 
suspended rule  and execution continues. Usills these operations, embedded 
s t r u c t u r e s  can b e  handled e a s i l y  (See Figure 3) .

Besides the pattern-matching, < peon> and < con ) can . ~ l s o  check

t i o n  of p rev ious  rules are conta ined  i n  r e g i s t e r s ,  n o t  in the s t r u c t u r e .  
We can check the c o n t e n t s  of t h e s e  r e g i s t e r s  by using < pcon > -part functions 
like GR, GU, e t c .  (these f u n c t i o n s  are l i s ted  i n  Table  2) and o t h e r  LISP 
functions d e f i n e d  by the usual LISP function, DEFINE. (See following page for 
Table  2 . )  
Semantic and c o n t e x t u a l  co-ord ina t ian  between s u b s t r u e t u r e s  can b e  
checked by using appropriate functions in the (con > - p a r t  o f  a r u l e .  
Semantic and contextual analyses cannot be expressed in the  form of s i m p l e  
r e w r i t i n g  rules. These analyses have differing requirements  such as l e x i c a l  
information about words which may in turn represent knowledge of t h e  world 
and contextual in format ion  which may. express t h e  s t a t e  of the world. We can 
use arbitrary LISP-forms i n  the 4 con 7 -part ,  according to what semantic and 
contextual models we choose.

3. POP-type : The (end > -part of t h i s  type is in the form (POP < s  try > ) 
When i t  is applied, the  processing of this l e v e l  is ended and the 
c o n t r o l  r e t u r n s  t o  t he  h igher  l e v e l  with the  va lue  s t r y  > . 
4 .  FM-type: The <end ) - p a r t  of this t y p e  is  i n  t h e  form (FM <failure-

inpu t  s t r i n g  = C D E ( A ( R l ( *  B ) ) ) F G )

I f  the r u l e  is a POP-type one, then this s t r u c t u r e  w i l l  be returned t o  the  
h igher  level processing. If i t  is NEXT- or NEXTB-type, then the c o n t r o l  w i l l  
move t o  the  s p e c i f i e d  state with t h i s  s t r u c t u r e .  
IV Push-down and Pop-up Operations 
By means of NEXTB-type r u l e s ,  w e  can s e t  up decision poin t s  i n  a 
program. We can a l s o  do this by using push-down and pop-up operat ions.  A 
ru l e  i n  PLATON f i n d s  particular s y n t a c t i c  c lues  by i ts  s t r u c t u r a l  desc r ip t ion  
( strx> ; and a t  the same time, extracts  substructures from the input 
st'king From the structural description i t  i s  predicted that the substructures 
may have particular constructions, that is ,  t h e y  may comprise noun phrases, 
relative clauses or whatever. It is-necessary to transfer the subst~r~ctures  
t o  s t a t e s  appropriate f o r  analyzing these constructions predicted and to return 
the analyzed structures back into the appropriate places In PLATON, these 
operations can be described in the Ctrans > -part o f  a rule. For example, 
suppose the <trans >-part of a rule is 
( ( (  Sl :K :K ) )  ( (  S2 ( :I : J ) / R E G  ) )  ) 
When the cantrol interprets t h i s  statement, the substructures corresponding 
to  the v a r u b l e  :K and ( :I : J ) are transferred t o  the s t a t e s  S1 and S 2  
respectively If the process ings  starting from these s t a t e s  are normally 
completed (by a POP-type r u l e ) ,  then the resu l t s  are stored i? the variable 
:K and the regzster /REG. In this manner, by means of the push-down and 
pop-up mechanisms, substructures can be analyzed from appropriate states. 
Processing from kese s t a t e s ,  however, may sometimes result in failure, 
That is ,  predictions that certain relationships w i l l  be  found among the 
elements of  substructures may not be f u l f i l l e d .  In such instances the pushed 
down state  w i l l  send an error-message appropriate t o  the cause of the failure 
by an W t y p e  rule.  An FM-type rule points o u t  that a certain error has 
occurred in the processing. If NEXTB-type rules were used i n  the previous 
processing a t  this l e v e l ,  control w i l l  go back to  the most recently used 
NEXTB-type r u l e .  If NEXTB-type rules were not used at this  processing leve l ,  
tne error-message specif ied by the FM-type rule w i l l  be sent t o  the <trans> 
part of the rule which directed this push-down operation ( see  Figure 4)

According t o  these error-messages, control-flow can be changed 
appropriately. For example, w e  can direct  processings by describing the 
4 trans > -part i n  the following way. 
( ( (  s l  :K :K ) (  ERR1 ( EXEC ( (  S5 :K :K 1) (( 56 ( :I :J ) /REG ) ) ) )  
( ERR2 ( T U N S  ( S8 / ) ) I  
( ( S 2  (j6 : I  :J ) /REG ) )  ) 
I n  t h e  above example, the processing of the substructure :K from the s t a t e  
S1 will produce one of the  fo l lowing  three results .  According to the 
returned value, the appropriate  step w i l l  b e  taken: 
(1) Normal return: the processing of :K is ended by a POP-type 
rule. The resul t  i s  s t o r e d  i n  the variable  :K and the n e x t  push-down 
performed, that i s  : I  : J ) w i l l  be  transferred t o  the state S2. 
(2) Return w i t h  an error-message: t h e  processing of :K results in 
a f a i l u r e  and an FM-type r u l e  sends up an error-message. If the  message is 
ERR1, them :K and :f :J ) w i l l  b e  analyzed from the states S5 and S6 
respectively (EXEC-type). If i t  is  ERRS, the interpreter  w i l l  give up the  
application o f  the present  rule, and pass the control to another state  S8 
(TRANS- type) .  If it is neither ERRl nor ERR2, the  same s t e p  as (3) w i l l  be 
taken 
(3)  Re turn w i t h  the value NIL: the processing Prom t h e  state S1 
w i l l  send up the value NIL if it runs into a blind alley, that is, there are no 
appl icable  r u l e s .  The interpreter w i l l  give up the a p p l i c a t i o n  of the present  
rule and proceed to the next rule attached t o  th is  state .  
Mechanisms, such that control flow can be appropriately changed 
according to the error-messages from lower level processings are n o t  found in 
Woods ATN parser, We can obtain flexible backtracking f a c i l i t i e s  by combining 
these mechanisms wi th  NEXTB- type rules.

A verb may govern several noun phrases preceding it. A relative clause 
modifying a noun may appear  i n  t he  form -- verD + noun -- The r i g h t  
boundary of t h e  clause is easily identified by f i n d i n g  the verb. The left 
boundary i s  o f t e n  much more d i f f i c u l t  t o  i d e n t i f y .  I n  Figure  5, t h e  noun 
phrase N P k r  is a c a s e  element of t he  verb V On the o t h e r  hand, t h e  noun 
phrase NPi is governed by the  verb Va Because the  r u l e  of p r o j e c t i o n s  holds 
i n  JaFnese as i n  o t h e r  languages, a l l  the noun phrases between NP c'+ I and 
V are governed by V , and the noun phrases b e f o r e  NP,: are governed by VA 
However, i n  the cou.rse of a n a l y s i s ,  such boundaries cannot be determined 
uniquely. The analysis program fixes a temporary boundary and proceeds t o  
the next s t e p  i n  process ing I f  the temporary boundary is not correct,  the 
succeeding processing w i l l  f a i l  and the con t ro l  w i l  come back to t he  po in t  
a t  which the temporary boundary was fixed. 
Now we w i l l  show a simple example of structural ana lys i s  by PLATON 
The example explains how the backtracking f a c i l i t y  is  used i n  analyzing 
Japanese sentences. Because we want t o  v i sua l i ze  t h e  operations of PLATON 
w i t h o u t  bo the r ing  w i t h  microscopic d e t a i l s  of Japanese sentences, we w i l l  
take an imaginary problem as an example. The parser which is written in 
PLATON is described in another paper by M Nagao and J. T s u j i i  (1976) 
An input s t r i n g  is assumed to be a l i s t .  The elements of the  list 
are in tegers  and trees are i n  the form of ( X (SUM 0)). Here 'X' may be  
regarded as a term modif ied  by 'SUM 0' These two kinds of elements are 
arranged i n  an arbitrary order, except that the last element i s  the tree 
(X(SUM 0)). The following is an example of an  i n p u t  s t r i n g :  
( 5 2 1 3  (x ( S r n  0)) 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 ( x (SUM 0)) ) 
Figure 6 An Example String t o  be Analyzed 
The result of the transformation is  expected to be i n  the following fotm: 
( ( X  (Sm4)) (XSm6)) (X (Sm9)) 1 
This result is regarded as representing the following relationships between 
integers and 'X' . 
The number associated with  an 'X' by the relation 'SUM' shows the sum of 
the integers which are governed by the X .  We can look upon the relations 
r between integers and an X' as the re la t ions  between noun phrases and the verb 
i n  Japanese sentences. The resul t  of the analysis  is assumed to satisfy 
the following conditions. 
46 
(1) Governor-governed re la t ionsh ips  between in tegers  and an 'X' must obey 
the project ion rule (i.e., clauses  do not  over lap) .  
( 2 )  A s  a simulation o f  a semantic r e s t r i c t i o n ,  w e  attach a condit ion that 
the sum of the in tegers  governed by an ' X '  should not  erceed ten .  
(3 )  As a s imulat ion  of a contextual r e s t r i c t i o n ,  w e  attach the condit ion 
that  a r e s u l t  (F ( X  (SUM num-1)) (X (SUM num-2)) . . . . ( X  (SUM num-N)) )

The input  string is  the! l is t  shown i n  Figure 6. Since the start state 
is S W P ,  the f i r s t  r u l e  attached t o  this state  is app l i ed .  This  r u l e  w i l l  
find the l e f tmos t  'x' and an integer just before  t he  ' x '  (by SUMUP -I-, strx). 
The v a r i a b l e  :I1 is bound to tius i n t e g e r .  This i n t e g e r  is added t o  t h e  sum 
of the i n t e g e r s ,  :N,  i f  the t o t a l  does n o t  exceed t en  (SUMUP -I-, con) .  
PUSHR, used i n  the  < a c t  > - p a r t ,  i s  a PLATON funct ion which puts  t h e  
second a rgument  on the head of the first argument (SUMUP -I-, a c t )  After 
t h i s  r u l e  is a p p l i e d ,  t h e  con t ro l  will enter the s t a t e  SUMUP again ( S W  -I-, 
end). That is, t h i s  rtile is app l ied  u n t i l  there a r e  no ~ n t e g e r s  before the 
f i r s t  ' X' or  the sum of the integers.  exceeds ten.  A s  the result, the 
environment i s  the following: 
s t r u c t u r e  under processing 
= qY 5 (X (SUM 6 ) )  3 1 ( X  ( S U M  0)) 2 2 ( X  (SUM 0)) ) 
r e l a t i o n s h i p  temporarily fixed be tween i n t e g e r s  and 'X' 
content  of /REG 
= ( 2 1 3 )  
The second rule of SUMUP w i l l  be a p p l i e d  next .  T h i s  rule checks by its 
1 con> p a r t  whether the r e s u l t  a t  hand s a t i s f i e s  the t h i r d  condition, 
t h a t  is, the contextual  r e s t r i c t i o n .  Because the  content  of /RESULT is NIL, 
t he  function CONTEXTCHECK r e t u r n s  the value T (SllMUl' -2-, con). So t h i s  
r u l e  i s  app l icab le .  Control makes the  s t a t e - t r a n s i t i o n  t o  the s t a t e  
BACKTRACK (SUMUP -2-, end.) Because the  first r u l e  of BACKTRACK is  a NEXTB- 
type yule,  s ta te-saving is performed. That i s ,  tbe fol lowing environment i s  
saved: content  of /REG = ( 2 1 3) 
content  of /RESULT = NIL 
structure under processing = 
# 5 (X (SUM 6 ) )  3 1 ( X (SUM 0 ) )  2 2 (X (SUM 0 ))  ) 
49 
By t h i s  ru les ,  the registers /REG and /RESULT are set  as follows ( BACKTRACK 
-I-, a c t ) .  /REG : = NIL 
/RESULT: = ( ( X (SUM 6 ) ) ) 
And the structure is transformed t o  
(X 5 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) 
A XEXTB- type  rule causes a s tate  transition as does a NEXT-type rule. So 
control returns to the state SUMUP (BACKTRACK -I-, end) . At tt.is s t a t e ,  a 
process s imilar t o  t h e  one described above is performed. As a result, the 
following governor-dependent relationships are es t a b l i s h e d .  
Here the  b o l d  l ines  indicate the  newly es tab l i shed  relat ionships.  By the 
f i r s t  rule of BACKTRACK the following environment is saved. 
conten t  of  /REG = ( 5 3 1 ) 
conten& of /RESULT = ( ( X (SLW 6 ) )  ) 
structure under processing = (# (X (SUM 9)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) 
And /REG and /RESULT are set as the following (BACKTRACK -1-, act) . 
/REG: = NIL 
/RESULT: = ( ( X  (SUM 6)) (X (SUM 9 ) )  ) 
The transformed structure is (BACKTRACK -10, end) 
Cjl 2 2 ( x  ( S U M O ) )  1 
The control is transferred to the sta te  SUMUP. By applying t h e  f irst  rule 
of t h i s  s t a t e  repeatedly on the above structure the fol lowing structure is 
obtained.  
(j( ( x SUM 4 ) )  1 
50 
However this result does not s a t i s f y  the  con textual restriction. 
So the application of t h e  second ru le  of SLJMl.JP f a i l s  because the  funct ion 
CONTEXTCHECK used i n  <con ) -part returns  the value NIL (SUMUP -2-, con) 
That is : 
con textcheck [(  (X (SUM 6 )  ) (X (SUM 9) ) ) : (X ( S U M  4 ) )  1 = N I L  
The third rule, therefore, w i l l  be  a p p l i e d  next. Because t h i s  rule is a 
%type r u l e  ( S U M U P  -3-, end) ,  it causes  an error and c o n t r o l  comes back t o  
the  point at which a NEXTB-type r u l e  w a s  appl i ed  most recently. The saved 
nv iro~ment  is restored. This is: 
/REG: = ( 5 3 1 ) 
/RESULT: = ( (X (SUM 6 ) )  ) 
s t r u c t u r e  under processing: = (* (X (SUM 9) )  2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) 
Then by applying the second rule of BACKTRACK, the governor-governed 
r e l a t i o n s h i p  e s t a b l i s h e d  l a s t l y  in the previous process  i s  c a n c e l l e d .  The 
s t r u c t u r e  and the  r e g i s t e r  /REG are changed as below (BACKTRACK -2-, act) : 
/REG: = ( 3 1 ) 
structure  under process ing:  ( 5 ( X  (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 ) )  ) 
Control enters the  BACKTRACK state again. The application of the 
first r u l e  saves the e n v i r o n ~ w n t  :
content of /REG = ( 3 1 ) 
content of /RESULT = ( (X (SUM 6 ) )  
s tructure  under processing = (1< 5 ( X (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 ) )  ) 
That is,  the  r e l a t i o n s h i p  indicated by t h e  dotted l i n e  i n  the fol lowing is  
cance l l ed:  
Control t r a n s i t s  t o  t h e  s t a t e  SUMUP (BACKTRACK -I-, end) and a 
similar process i s  performed. However, because the governor-governed 
relationship between t h e  i n t e g e r  5 and t h e  second 'Xr i s  c a n c e l l e d ,  t h e  sum 
of the i n t e g e r s  governed by the  f i r s t  'X', ( 2 1 3 ) ,  i s  g r e a t e r  than t h a t  
of the second ' X' , ( 3 1 ) . The contextual cond i t i on ,  t h e r e f o r e ,  is  no t  
fulfilled, and the a p p l i c a t i o n  of the second r u l e  of SUMUP will n o t  succeed.  
So the t emporar i ly  established relationships w i l l  be c a n c e l l e d  one-by-one as 
follows. 
After  these r e l a t i o n s h i p s  have been cance l l ed ,  the desired r e s u l t  is  obta ined 
by the f o l l owing  sequence.

V I  Conclusion 
We have described a programming language c a l l e d  PLATON f o r  n a t u r a l  
language processing.  The language has s e v e r a l  a d d i t i o n a l  capabilities beyond 
the ATN parser of W. Woods. 
Grammars written i n  t h e  language n o t  only maintain c l a r i t y  of 
representation but a l s o  provide adequately a n a t u r a l  i n t e r f a c e  between the 
s y n t a c t i c  component and o t h e r  components. By means of t h e  pa t te rn-matching  
facility, w e  can write grammars i n  a quite n a t u r a l  manner. And because of 
the  PLATON v a r i a b l e  b inding mechanism, semantic and con tex tua l  LISP f u a c t i o n s  
a e a s i l y  incorpora ted  i n  s y n t a c t i c  patterns. 
Flex ib l e  backtracking mechanisms and push-down opera t ions  make com- , 
r, Acatecr non-de te rmin i s t i c  processing possible i n  a very simple way. 
We a r e  now deveLoping an analysis program f o r  Japanese using t h i s  
language. The program can accept  f a i r l y  complicated s e n t e n c e s  i n  a textbook 
of elementary chemistry It can u t i l i z e  t h e  lexical and contextual  information 
of chemistry adequately during the  analysis. Such in format ion  i n  our system 
is expressed i n  the form of a semantic network s i m i l a r  t o  that of R. F. Simmons 
(1973 ) .  
Perhaps,  PLATON i t s e l f  must be e q u i p p e d  w i t h  more semantics and 
context-oriented o p e r a t i o n s  such as specified lexical d e s c r i p t i o n s  and funct ions  
us ing  them. However, what desc r ip t ion  method is most efficient, and moreover, 
what semantic information must be stored i n  the lexicon, a r e  not y e t  entirely 
clear. So, as the f i r s t  s t e p ,  PLATON leaves many p a r t s  of these  problems f o r  
53 
the user t o  spec i fy  by LISP programs. PLAMN is written in LIS1'1.5 and 
implemented on a FACOM 230-60 a t  the Kyoto University computing center and a 
TOSBAC-40 mini-computer in our laboratory. The interpreter of PLATON i t s e l f  
requires only 4 . 5  K c e l l s .

E D I T O R ' S  R E P O R T  
During 1975,  t h i s  Journal published 20 contributions through 
t h e  ordinary channels of review; it also published two micro- 
fiches of abstracts from the Varna conference and five 
microfiches of proceedings of the 1975 Annual Meeting of the 
Association f o r  Computational Linguistics. A d i r e c t o r y  of 
members also appeared. 
Early in 1975, the Journal announced an experimental procedure 
for review of submiesions; the author could submit a 600-word 
summary f o r  distribution t o  a l l  members of the  E d i t o r i a l  
Board, ?If the  l a s t  30 submissions, 1 5  have used this proce- 
dure. Contr ibutors  and Board members appear sat i s f ied  with 
the resul ts .  
The number of microfiches distributed in t h e  1975 s u b c r i p t i o n  
was 2 2 ,  up from the 14 distributed t o  I974 members. But the 
number of frames increased from 900 t o  1700, roughly; as 
anticipated, the average number of frames filled is going up 
Since the f i rs t  announcement of the Journal, 86 submissions 
have been received. Their present status is shown a t  the top  
of the following frame.

At the end of March, 1975, 10 manuscripts were out for ninor

for major re sion, t w o  have been published. We might thus 
expect to publish as many a s  7 or 8 of the manuscripts now 
out for  revision, making a total of about 36 of 81 received; 
our ultimate acceptance rate may be around 45%. 
The financial support of the National Science Foundation, 
which continued through 1975, and the unpaid help of both 
the State University of New York and the Xerox Palo Alto 
Research Center (the latter is processing bibliographies and 
indexes) have been most significant in establishing the new 
Journal. The work of the Editorial  Board, editorial aides,  
and the staff  of t h e  Center for Applied Linguistics are also

PRELIMINARY REPORT 
The l a s t  mailing of the L975 subscription included a question- 
naire about the level and direction of members interests, 
their use of the  J o u r n a l ,  and t h e i r  preferences among three 
forms of publication: microfiche, paper, and mixed. 
By the end of January, 200 replies had arrived and the rate of 
arrival had diminished * The present r e p o r t  makes no in terpre-  
tations or explanations; the figures are here for the Editorial 
Board, the Executive Committee, and the members to examine. 
All written comments received in response to the questionnaire 
are presented following t h e  numerical d a t a .  
Members who have strong opinions about the policy the Associa- 
tion should adopt  may write to any o f f i c e r  of the Journal  or 
Association; but prompt action is needed in order  t o  permit 
planning and development of manuscripts for t h e  1977 volume. 
* The issue l e f t  the e d i t o r  on November 7; t he  questionnaire 
was to be returned "by December 31!' Due to unforeseen delays, 
the issue reached readers beginning m e d i a t e l y  after Christmas 
in the Washington area, and la te  i n  January i n  Hawail and abroad.

LONG COMMENTS 
Here's my survey questionnaire. Anent the decision as to where 
to go from here, I have a very strong recommendation to make. I 
think you're in a pioneering position on something very important, 
and should stick with it, certainly for at least two o r  three 
more years if at a l l  possible. The major difficulty and source 
of o b j e c t i o n s ,  I think, is not any of the arguments against 
microfiche that you outline, but simply the difficulty people 
have in adopting radical ly  new habits in such a fundamental ac- 
t i v i t y  as reading. 
Which Srings me to the second point. I think that a s  a pioneer, 
the E d i t o r i a l  Board of the  AJCL has a responsibility to try to 
make the experiment- succeed, and not  just sit back and watch. 
Specifically, I think it's v e r y  important to make available to 
subscribers a microfiche reader which works reasonably well, is 
not t e r r i b l y  expensive, and most importantly, is easy to acquire. 
I would bet  that if you arranged with a manufacturer or dealer 
to supply a small, practical reader in the $25-$35 price range, 
which people could order  simply by writing their name and address 
on an addressed, postage-paid return card included in an M C L  
packet, at l ea s t  a hundred would be sold within a month You 
wbuld have done your readers a service, and would alsb have 
broadened the base of those who are in a position to make use of 
the micro? iche format. 
There are a var ie ty  of d e t a i l s  t o - b e  considered in implementing 
such a plan, for instance, that .  the supplier should be prepared 
t o  make exchanges f o r  defective units, but I ' m  sure that the 
members of the Editorial Board are  as a l e r t  to these as I am. I 
would appreciate hearing what reaction people have to this 
suggestion.

I am quite pleased  at receiving the AJCL on microfiche and would 
hope that other organizations to which I belong would at least 
offe r  optional microfiche subscriptions to their journals. I 
find myself inundated w i t h  prfnted publications and am running 
out of space to store these valuable documents; I do not want my 
of f i ce  or my home turned into a library. 
When I receive a copy of the AJCL, I read through the opaque 
cards looking for paper summaries that interest me. When I f i n d  
such a paper, I use the department's microfiche reader to browse 
through it. Occasionally I have the l ibrary  make a paper copy 
for me so that I can study papers without access to a microfiche 
viewer. 
One service which I think might be useful for ATCL subscribers 
without such convenient access to hard-copy microfiche machines 
would be an opaque card which one could use to order paper copies 
of selected articles.

The microfiche journal i s  the b e s t  thing ACL has g o t  going f o r  
it. In che las t  couple of years, I've been letting my member- 
s h i p s  in a number of organizations lapse. One of the p r i n c i p a l  
reasons is that I simply can't cope with the f l o o d  of paper 
which results from memberships. My house and o f f i c e  get c l u t -  
tered up with stacks of magazines that can't be chucked because 
one article in a dozen looks as if it ought t o  be read some time. 
It's gotten to the point where new issues go straight from the 
mailbox t o  the recyclery. For this "servfce", one pays extra. 
Microfiche solves that;  I 've  got two years' worth of ACL output 
in a 6" x 6%'' metal box, and there's room far two  more years. 
If I ever run out of room for metal boxes, I can cull out se- 
lected cards.

More notes on your questionnaire! 
(1) I have been getting IEEE Computer, IEEE Computer Transactions, 
and IEEE Spectrum since 1969 on microfiche. I no longer have 
paper copies of these earlier issues. I bought a cheap micro- 
f i c h e  reader in 1969. 
(2) I bought a Realist (Xerox 320) l.fi .rears ago.  
(3 )  1 also g e t  now AJCL Journal (yours), Scientific American 
(Bell & Howell) , IEEE Software Engineering regularly on micro- 
fiche. 
( 4 )  I buy selected t i t l e s  from NTIS and University Microfj-Lms 
(Micromedia--kids books) . 1 subscribe to NTIS computer xeekly 
abstracts @$3O/yr. No company reimbursement. 
(5) After a years research I have produced my f i r s t  amateur 
microfiche at home which dops on a Bruning. (So I now will be 
a publisher!) 
(6) I am a microfilm/microEiche COM expert in Management Systems 
a t  work (only part t ime) .  I am a systems analyst on data center 
management software . 
(7) Being an engineer and an analyst AJCL is currently a peri- 
pheral area of interest. I would not have joined your organi- 
zation if your journal was only on paper. I got into microfilming 
because I was running out of space. 
(8) I believe I will be able to keep a tremendously large number 
o f  journals, magazines, professional or pleasure reading books if 
they are on microfiche. By keeping good inventories in a safe ty  
deposit  box I will have good insurance and replacement in case of 
f i r e .  
49) Able t o  m i c r o f i l m  (fiche) myself I will be able t o  archive 
(and back u p  against f i r e )  any book or paper I work on. It would 
be easier to correspond and exchange papers with someone around 
the world or U.S. Lower postage. 
(10) I would like to see a l l  hard bound and paper back books, 
all magazines available on microfiche. The savings for the 
Library of Congress and copyright o f f  ice would be tremendous. 
These fiche should also  be available to individuals from t he  
publishers. 
(11) I also get the ACM Communications, and ACM Surveys on f i che  
I trust I will see the results  of your survey, and maybe my let- 
t e r ,  in the next AJCL Newsletter.

Your recent questionnaire on the AJCL format invited additional 
comment I may be biased but I think micropublication of our 
journal is a superb answer t o  t h e  twin problems of skyrocketing 
publication/distribution costs  and the need to disseminate more 
information to students of this growing field. 
No serious student or scholar should be without a microf iche  
reader. Good compact readers from $100 (the Bell & Howell 
Brief CaS e reader) to $214 (the Washington Scientific Industries 
Mini-Cat) are available. Surely a modest investment for a 
life-time of use. 
I do think, however, that you can more effectively package the 
microfiche for increased user convenience. There are two basic 
approaches: 1) Bind f i c h e  envelopes and the eye-legible cards 
together before they are distributed to subscribers or 2) provide 
subscribers with a conyenient microfiche binder file.

It is my opinion that far from being a disadvantage, microfiche 
is a positive advantage. Already a large amount of my home and 
office space is devoted to storing technical journals which I 
have saved over the years, and as time passes t h e  problem will 
only get worse. I only hope that you will continue to distribute 
AJCL on fiche, and that other journals will follow your example. 
I do,  h o w e v e r , f i n d  the  small s i z e  of the opaque cards to be in- 
convenient. Perhaps you could combine a l l  the opaque cards in 
each issue i n t o  one or two 85x11" sheets, which could be fo lded  
when m a i l e d ,  then spread open and c o l l e c t e d  in a looseleaf or 
other book when received.

While having the freedom to publish very d e t a i l e d  accounts of 
l a r g e  programs is useful I think that a more space conscious 
medium would encourage more concise descriptions. The freedom to 
be verbose does not strike me as a good idea  in t h i s  f i e l d !  
Also, it is difficult to judge the effect  of the microfiche format 
on soliciting manuscripts because the journal is new and thus has 
no developed prestige.

I 12lieve the best alternative would be to 1) continue journal on 
micro? iche , 2) arrange to sell inexpensive readers to subscribers 
through ACL (or widely publ ic ize  where and for how much readers 
are available) 3)  offer hard copy versions of articles by indi- 
vidual order.

I am a computer programer by profession and my interest in lin- 
guis tics extends only to those areas which are directly applica- 
ble to computers. Even there my interest is more concerned w i t h  
the practical  s ide  rather than with  esoteric theory. Since most 
of what you print can only be considered a s  future referent mate- 
r ia l  by m e ,  your printing o f  the journal on microfiche is eminently 
satisfying to me; in fact ,  if you switched entirely to paper, I 
would have to seriously consider my continued receiving of the 
j ournal .

SHORT COMMENTS 
General 
Fiche is good for scanning and storing info where only occasional 
reference is needed. Paper copy needd  for the few papers of 
frequently needed reference. 
It didn't even reach me until Jan. 5. probably due to a poorly 
registered address label. (I bet il l o t  don't make it if they're 
all a s  bad as mine.)  
I am a student and could not afford AJCL publications in  p r i n t e d  
form. 
You might make the microfiche envelope larger (to contain the 
opaque copy) and use face of envelope to print information on it 
You should  have asked how long I was a member to interpret t h i s  
stuff. 
Sorry this is late One of my major reasons f o r  subscribing to 
AJCL is tha t  it is published in microfiche. 
For $10 a year I am very satisfied. You might  consider negative 
contrast t o  ease the eye strain 
I haven't found time to read articles but  expect to and like the 
format. 
Love fiche. 
A t  th i s  moment Itan not working d i r e c t l y  i n  t h e  field of CL. 
PLEASE NOTE: Negative, rather than positive, microfiche pro- 
vides the  clearest and easiest t o  read copy. An o p t i o n  for 
negative fiche-copy would encourage a great deal of new member- 
ships.  
1) Do offer printed cop ies .  
than "prestige" (whose?) 
2) Currency is fa r  more important 
Only major complaint about fiche i s  that all the readers are 
lousy on the eyes. 
I prefer to be forced to get used t o  microfiche because paper 
should n o t  be wasted. 
D e s p i t e  the current  inconvenience for me of microfiche publica- 
tion, I am in favor of continued publication on the grounds that 
maybe it'll spread and eventually encourage better  reader tech- 
nology. 
A l o t  of good work is being done by people who are not t oo  
famous; it's very importarlt t ha t  it should be published inexpen- 
sively somewhere.

Most likely. 
B u t  it is s t i l l  experimental. Give it a chance. 
Loses some but gains others that are too long f o r  
publication elsewhere. 
Probably. Difficult ta be sure since it is a new

At least it would lose m i n e .  
B u t  because of the format, gains others. Balance 
Answer  no: Don't know but I suspect not since alternatives are 
so few. 
I feel there is more prestige in microform. 
Question 7.

Answer other: EithPr fiche or  paper but  n o t  mixed.  
Either fiche or mixed. No paper .  
Paper and mixed. Depends on m i x .  
Question 10. 
Answer no: Would use a library copy and Xerox. 
Probably not. 
Offer on paper only. 
Answer ? Yes and no; pay more for the larger journal to 
continue; prefer microfiche. 
Stupid  question--depends on question 8 situation. 
If paper copies of separate articles not available 
probably so--otherwise no t .  
Question 11.
