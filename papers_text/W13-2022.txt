Abstract
In this paper, we present the methods
we used to extract bacteria and biotopes
names and then to identify the relation
between those entities while participating
to the BioNLP?13 Bacteria and Biotopes
Shared Task. We used machine-learning
based approaches for this task, namely
a CRF to extract bacteria and biotopes
names and a simple matching algorithm to
predict the relations. We achieved poor re-
sults: an SER of 0.66 in sub-task 1, and a
0.06 F-measure in both sub-tasks 2 and 3.
1 Introduction
The BioNLP?13 Bacteria and Biotopes shared task
aims at extracting bacteria names (bacterial taxa)
and biotopes names (bacteria habitats; geographi-
cal and organization entities). The task comprises
three sub-tasks (Bossy et al, 2012b).
? Sub-task 1 aims at extracting habitat names
and linking those names to the relevant con-
cept from the OntoBiotope ontology.
? Sub-task 2 aims at identifying relations be-
tween bacteria and habitats among two kinds
of relations (localization, part-of) based on
a ground truth corpus of bacteria and habitat
names. The ?localization? relation is the link
between a bacterium and the place where it
lives while the ?part-of? relation is the rela-
tion between hosts and host parts (bacteria)
(Bossy et al, 2012a).
? Sub-task 3 aims at extracting all bacteria and
biotopes names (including both habitat and
geographical names), and then identifying re-
lations between these concepts.
In this paper, we present the methods we de-
signed as first time participant to the BioNLP Bac-
teria Biotopes Shared Task.
2 Background
Scientific documents provide useful information
in many domains. Because processing those docu-
ments is time-consuming for a human, NLP tech-
niques have been designed to process a huge
amount of documents quickly. The microorgan-
isms ecology domain involves a lot of microorgan-
isms (bacteria, living and dead cells, etc.) and
habitats (food, medical, soil, water, hosts, etc.)
that have been described in details in the literature.
NLP techniques would facilitate the access to in-
formation from scientific texts and make it avail-
able for further studies.
Bacteria and biotopes identification has been
addressed for the first time during the BioNLP
2011 Bacteria Biotopes shared task (Bossy et
al., 2012a; Kim et al, 2011). This task con-
sisted in extracting bacteria location events from
texts among eight categories (Host, HostPart, Ge-
ographical, Environment, Food, Medical, Water
and Soil).
Three teams participated in this task. All sys-
tems followed the same process: in a first stage,
they detected bacteria names, detected and typed
locations; then, they used co-reference to link the
extracted entities; the last stage focused on the
event extraction.
Bjo?rne et al (2012) adapted an SVM-based
Named Entity Recognition system and used the
list of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in
Nomenclature. Nguyen and Tsuruoka (2011) used
a CRF-based system and used the NCBI web page
about the genomic BLAST. Ratkovic et al (2012)
designed an ad hoc rule-based system based on the
NCBI Taxonomy. The participants obtained poor
results (Table 1) which underlines the complexity
of this task.

3 Corpus
3.1 Presentation
The corpus comprises web pages about bacte-
rial species written for non-experts. Each text
consists of a description of individual bacterium
and groups of bacteria, in terms of first observa-
tion, characteristics, evolution and biotopes. Two
corpora have been released including both raw
textual documents and external reference annota-
tions. The training corpus contains 52 textual doc-
uments while the development corpus contains 26
documents. No tokenization has been performed
over the documents. In Table 2, we provide some
statistics on the annotations performed over both
corpora for each type of entity to be annotated
(bacteria, habitat, and geographical).

3.2 Corpus analysis
The bacteria names appear in the texts, either in
their longer form (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.
citri), in a partial form (Xanthomonas) or in their
abbreviated form (Xac). The abbreviations are
case-sensitives since they follow the original form:
MmmSC is derived from M. mycoides ssp my-
coides SC.1 A few bacteria names can appear in
the text followed by a trigger word: Spirillum bac-
teria, but it will be abbreviated in the remainder of
the text, sometimes with a higher degree of speci-
ficity: S. volutans standing for Spirillum volutans.

Colony in its longer form.
4 Methods
This year, the BioNLP organizers encouraged the
participants to use supporting resources in order
to reduce the time-investment in the challenge.
Those resources encompass sentence splitting, to-
kenization, syntactic parsing, and biological anno-
tations. Moreover, a specific ontology has been
released for the Bacteria Biotopes task.
We used some of the resources provided and
combined them with additional resources, in a
machine-learning framework we specifically de-
signed for this task.
4.1 Linguistic resources
4.1.1 The OntoBiotope Ontology
OntoBiotope2 is an ontology tailored for the
biotopes domain. The BioNLP-ST 2013 version
has been released in the OBO format. This ontol-
ogy integrates 1,756 concepts. Each concept has
been given a unique ID and is associated with ex-
act terms and related synonyms. The concept is
also defined in a ?is a? relation. The normaliza-
tion of the habitat names in the first sub-task must
be based on this ontology.
For example, the concept microorganism
(unique id MBTO:00001516) is a living organ-
ism which unique id is MBTO:00000297. For this
concept, microbe is an exact synonym while mi-
crobial is a related synonym (see Figure 1).
[Term]
id: MBTO:00001516
name: microorganism
exact synonym: ?microbe? [TyDI:23602]
related synonym: ?microbial? [TyDI:23603]
is a: MBTO:00000297 ! living organism
Figure 1: The concept microorganism in the On-
toBiotope ontology
4.1.2 The NCBI taxonomy
In order to help our system to identify the bacte-
ria names, we built a list of 357,387 bacteria taxa
based on the NCBI taxonomy database3 (Feder-
hen, 2012). This taxonomy describes a small part
(about 10%) of the living species on earth, based
on public sequence databases.

It includes twelve categories of information
from the biological domain (bacteria, inverte-
brates, mammals, phages, plants, primates, ro-
dents, synthetics, unassigned, viruses, vertebrates
and environmental samples).
We extracted from this taxonomy all names be-
longing to the Bacteria category, which represent
24.3% of the content. This output includes a few
variants of bacteria names (see Table 3).

4.1.3 The Cocoa annotations
Cocoa is a WebAPI annotator tool for biological
text.4 We used the Cocoa annotations provided by
the organizers as part of the supporting resources.
These annotations emphasize 37 pre-defined cate-
gories. We noticed a few categories are often tied
with one of the three kinds of entities we have to
process:
? Bacteria: Cell, Chemical, Mutant Organism,
Organism, Protein, Unknown;
? Habitat: Body part, Cell, Cellu-
lar component, Chemical, Disease, Food,
Geometrical part, Habitat, Location,
Multi-tissue structure, Organism, Organ-
ism subdivision, Pathological formation,
Tissue;
? Geographical: Company, Habitat, Technique,
Unknown.
We believe these categories should be useful to
identify bacteria and biotopes entities in the texts,
and we used them as features in the CRF model
(see column #10 in Table 4).

4.2 System
4.2.1 Formalisms
Depending on the sub-task to process, we used two
distinct formalisms implemented in the Wapiti tool
(Lavergne et al, 2010) to build our models:
? Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty
et al, 2001; Sutton and McCallum, 2006)
to identify bacteria and biotopes names (sub-
tasks 1 and 3).
? Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) (Guiasu and
Shenitzer, 1985; Berger et al, 1996) to pro-
cess the relationships between entities (sub-
tasks 2 and 3).
4.2.2 Bacteria biotopes features set
We used several sets of features, including ?classi-
cal? internal features (columns #4 to #7 in Table 4:
typographic, digit, punctuation, length) and a few
semantic features. In table 4, we present a sam-
ple tabular file produced in order to train the CRF
model.
? Presence of the token in the NCBI taxonomy
(column #9);
? Presence of the token in the OntoBiotope on-
tology (column #8);
? Category of the token based on the Cocoa an-
notations (column #10);
? Unsupervised clusters (column #11) created
using Brown?s algorithm (Brown et al, 1992)
with Liang?s code5 (Liang, 2005).
Taxonomy feature. We noticed that 1,169 to-
kens out of 1,229 (95.1%) tokens we identified in
the NCBI taxonomy in both corpora correspond to
a Bacteria name in the reference (Table 5). This
characteristic should be useful to identify the bac-
teria names.
OntoBiotope feature. Regarding the presence
of the token in the OntoBiotope ontology, we no-
ticed that 1,487 tokens out of 1,906 (78.0%) from
both corpora correspond to a habitat name in the
reference (Table 6). The identification of habitat
names will benefit from this characteristic.

4.2.3 Normalization with OntoBiotope
Habitat names normalization consisted in linking
the habitat names to the relevant concept in the
OntoBiotope ontology using an exact match of the
phrase to be normalized. This exact match is based
on both singular and plural forms of the phrase
to normalize, using a home-made function that in-
cludes regular and irregular plural forms. Never-
theless, we did not manage discontinuous entities.

4.2.4 Relationships approaches
Relationships features set. Our MaxEnt model
only relies on the kind of entities that can be linked
together:
? Bacterium and Localization (Habitat) for a
?localization? relation,
? Host and Part for a ?PartOf? relation (be-
tween two entities being of the same type).
147
For example, Bifidobacterium is a bacteria
name, human and human gastrointestinal tract are
two habitats (localizations). A ?localization? re-
lation can occur between Bifidobacterium and hu-
man while a ?PartOf? relation occurs between hu-
man and human gastrointestinal tract.
Basic approach. For the official submission, we
did not use this model because of the following
remaining problems: (i) a few relations we pro-
duced were not limited to the habitat category but
also involved the geographical category, (ii) we
did not manage the relations we produced in du-
plicate, and (iii) the weight our CRF system gave
to each relation was not relevant enough to be used
(for a relation involving A with B, C, and D, the
same weight was given in each relation).
All of those problems led us to process the re-
lations between entities using a too much simple
approach: we only considered if the relation be-
tween two entities from the test exists in the train-
ing corpus. This approach is not robust as it does
not consider unknown relations.
5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Identification of bacteria and biotopes
In this subsection, we present the results we
achieved on the development corpus (Table 2) to
identify bacteria and biotopes names without link-
ing those names to the concept in the OntoBiotope
ontology. We built the model on the training cor-
pus and applied it on the development corpus. The
evaluation has been done using the conlleval.pl
script6 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)
that has been created to evaluate the results in the
CoNLL-2000 Shared Task. We chose this script
because it takes as input a tabular file which is
commonly used in the machine-learning process.
Nevertheless, the script does not take into account
the offsets to evaluate the annotations, which is
the official way to evaluate the results. We give
in Table 7 the results we achieved. Those re-
sults show our system succeed to correctly iden-
tify the bacteria and biotopes names. Neverthe-
less, the biotopes names are more difficult to pro-
cess than the bacteria names. Similarly, Kolluru
et al (2011) achieved better results on the bacteria
category rather than on the habitat, confirming this
last category is more difficult to process.

There is still room for improvement, especially
in order to improve the recall in each category. We
plan to define some post-treatments so as to iden-
tify new entities and thus, increase the recall in
those three categories.

5.2.1 Habitat entities normalization
General results. The first sub-task is evaluated
using the Slot Error Rate (Makhoul et al, 1999),
based on the exact boundaries of the entity to be
detected and the semantic similarity of the concept
from the ontology between reference and hypothe-
sis (Bossy et al, 2012b). This semantic similarity
is based on the ?is a? relation between two con-
cepts.
We achieved a 0.66 SER which places us 4th
out of four participants. Other participants ob-
tained SERs ranging from 0.46 to 0.49. Our sys-
tem achieved high precision (0.62) but low recall
(0.35). It produced two false positives and 144
false negatives. Out of 283 predicted habitats,
175.34 are correct. There was also a high number
of substitutions (187.66).
Correct entity, incorrect categorization. On
the entity boundaries evaluation, our system SER
(0.45) was similar to that of the other participants
(from 0.46 to 0.42). We achieved a 1.00 preci-
sion, a 0.56 recall and a 0.71 F-measure (the best
from all participants). Those results are consistent
with those we achieved on the development cor-
pus (Table 7) and confirm the benefit of using a
CRF-based system for entity detection.
148
While we correctly identified the habitat enti-
ties, the ontology categorization proved difficult:
we achieved an SER of 0.62 while other partic-
ipants obtained SERs ranging from 0.38 to 0.35.
For this task, we relied on exact match for map-
ping the concept to be categorized and the con-
cepts from the ontology, including both singular
and plural forms match. When no match was
found, because the categorization was mandatory,
we provided a default identifier?the first identi-
fier from the ontology?which is rarely correct.7
5.2.2 Relationships between entities
General results. The relation sub-task is evalu-
ated in terms of recall and precision for the pre-
dicted relations. On both second and third sub-
tasks, due to our too basic approach, we only
achieved a 0.06 F-measure. Obviously, because
considering only existing relations is not a robust
approach, the recall is very low (R=0.04). The
precision is not as high as we expected (P=0.19),
which indicates that if a relation exists in the train-
ing corpus for two entities, this relation does not
necessarily occur within the test for the two same
entities (two entities can occur in the same text
without any relation to be find between them). On
the second sub-task, other participants obtained
F-measures ranging from 0.42 to 0.27, while on
the third sub-task, the other participants obtained
a 0.14 F-measure, which underlines the difficulty
of the relation task.
Out of the two types of relation to be found,
this simple approach yielded better results for the
Localization relation (F=0.07) than for the PartOf
relation (F=0.02). While our results are probably
too bad to yield a definite conclusion, the results
of other participant also reflect a difference in per-
formance for relation Localization and PartOf.
Improvements. After fixing the technical prob-
lems we encountered, we plan to test other algo-
rithms such as SVM, which may be more adapted
for this kind of task.
6 Additional experiments
After the official submission, we carried out addi-
tional experiments.
7We gave the MBTO:00000001 identifier which is the id
for the concept ?gaz seep?.
6.1 Habitat entities normalization
6.1.1 Beyond exact match
The improvements we made on the habitat enti-
ties normalization are only based on the mapping
between the predicted concept and the ontology.
In our official submission, we only used an exact
match. We tried to produce a more flexible map-
ping in several ways.
First, we tried to normalize the mention gather-
ing all words from the mention into a single word.
Indeed, the concept ?rain forest? is not found in
the ontology while the concept ?rainforest? in one
word exists.
Second, we split the mention into single words
and tried matching based on the features listed be-
low, in order to manage the subsumption of con-
cepts.
? all words except the first one: ?savannah?
instead of ?brazilian savannah?,
? all words except the last one: ?glossina? in-
stead of ?glossina brevipalpis?,
? the last three words (we did not find example
in the corpus),
? the first three words: ?sugar cane fields? in-
stead of ?sugar cane fields freshly planted
with healthy plants?,
? the last two words: ?tsetse fly? instead of
?blood-sucking tsetse fly?,
? and the first two words: ?tuberculoid gran-
ulomas? instead of ?tuberculoid granulomas
with caseous lesions?.
If two parts of a mention can be mapped to two
concepts in the ontology, we added both concepts
in the output.
We also extended the coverage of the ontology
using the reference normalization from both train-
ing and development corpora, adding 316 entries
in the ontology. Those new concepts can be con-
sidered either as synonyms or as hyponyms:
? synonyms: ?root zone? is a synonym of ?rhi-
zosphere?. While only the second one occurs
in the ontology, we added the first concept
with the identifier from the second concept;
? hyponyms: ?bacteriologist? and ?entomol-
ogist? are both hyponyms of ?researcher?.
We gave the hypernym identifier to the hy-
ponym concepts.
149
At last, if no concept was found in the ontology,
instead of using the identifier of the first concept
in the ontology, we gave as a default identifier the
one of the more frequent concept in the corpora.8
This strategy improves system performance.
6.1.2 Results
The improvements we made allowed us to
achieved better results on the test corpus (table 9).
While on the official submission we achieved a
0.66 Slot Error Rate, we obtained a 0.53 SER
thanks to the improvements we made. This new
result does not lead us to obtain a better rank, but it
is closer to the ones the other participants achieved
(from 0.49 to 0.46).

These improvements led us to obtain better re-

call is still the lowest of all participants (0.48 vs.
[0.60;0.72]), our precision is the highest (0.85 vs.
[0.48;0.61]) and our F-measure is equal to the
highest one (0.61 vs. [0.57;0.61]).
6.2 Relationships between entities
6.2.1 Processing
On the relationships, as a first step, we fixed
the problems that prevented us to use the Max-
Ent model during the submission stage: (i) we
produced correct files for the algorithm, remov-
ing the geographical entities from our processing
accordingly with the guidelines, (ii) when deal-
ing with all possible combinations of entities that
can be linked together, we managed the relations
so as not to produce those relations in duplicate,
8The concept ?human? with identifier MBTO:00001402
is the more frequent concept in all corpora while the concept
?gaz seep? with identifier MBTO:00000001 was never used.
and (iii) we better managed the confidence score
given by the CRF on each relation.
6.2.2 Results
We produced new models on the training corpus
based on the following features: entities to be
linked, category of each entity, and whether a re-
lation between those entities exists in the training
corpus. We performed two evaluations of those
models: (i) on the development corpus, using the
official evaluation script, and (ii) on the test cor-
pus via the evaluation server.9 As presented in
Table 10, we achieved worse results (F=0.02 and
F=0.03) than our official submission (F=0.06) on
the test corpus.

We also noticed that we achieved very poor re-
sults on the test corpus while the evaluation on the
development corpus provided promising results,
with a F-measure decreasing from 0.26 to 0.02 on
the first experiment, and from 0.66 to 0.04 on the
second one. The difference between the results
from both development and test corpora is hard to
understand. We have to perform additional anal-
yses on the outputs we produced to identify the
problem that occurred.
Moreover, we plan to use more contextual fea-
tures (specific words that indicate the relation, dis-
tance between two entities, presence of relative
pronouns, etc.) to improve the model. Indeed, in
relations between concepts, not only the concepts
must be studied but also the context in which they
occur as well as the linguistic features used in the
neighborhood of those concepts.
9The reference annotations from the test corpus will not
be released to the participants. Instead of those relations, an
evaluation server has been opened after the official evaluation
took place.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented the methods we used
as first time participant to the BioNLP Bacteria
Biotopes Shared Task.
To detect bacteria and biotopes names, we used
a machine-learning approach based on CRFs. We
used several resources to build the model, among
them the NCBI taxonomy, the OntoBiotope on-
tology, the Cocoa annotations, and unsupervised
clusters created through Brown?s algorithm. The
normalization of the habitat names with the con-
cepts in the OntoBiotope ontology was performed
with a Perl script based on exact match of the en-
tity to be found, taking into account its plural form.
On this sub-task, we achieved a 0.66 Slot Error
Rate.
In order to process the relationships between en-
tities, our MaxEnt model was not ready for the of-
ficial submission. The simple approach we used
relies on the identification of the relation between
entities only if the relation exists in the training
corpus. This simple approach is not robust enough
to correctly process new data. On the relation sub-
tasks, due to the approach we used, we achieved a
0.06 F-measure.
On the first sub-task, we enhanced our habitat
entities normalization process, which led us to im-
prove our Slot Error Rate from 0.66 (official sub-
mission) to 0.53 (additional experiments).
On the relation detection, first, we plan to make
new tests with more features, including contextual
features. Second, we plan to test new algorithms,
such as SVM which seems to be relevant to pro-
cess relationships between entities.
