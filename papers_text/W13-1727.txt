Abstract
In this paper, we describe our approach to na-
tive language identification and discuss the re-
sults we submitted as participants to the First
NLI Shared Task. By resorting to a wide set of
general?purpose features qualifying the lexi-
cal and grammatical structure of a text, rather
than to ad hoc features specifically selected
for the NLI task, we achieved encouraging re-
sults, which show that the proposed approach
is general?purpose and portable across differ-
ent tasks, domains and languages.
1 Introduction
Since the seminal work by Koppel et al (2005),
within the Computational Linguistics community
there has been a growing interest in the NLP?based
Native Language Identification (henceforth, NLI)
task. However, so far, due to the unavailability
of balanced and wide?coverage benchmark corpora
and the lack of evaluation standards it has been dif-
ficult to compare the results achieved for this task
with different methods and techniques (Tetreault et
al., 2013). The First Shared Task on Native Lan-
guage Identification (Tetreault et al, 2013) can be
seen as an answer to the above mentioned problems.
In this paper, we describe our approach to na-
tive language identification and discuss the results
we submitted as participants to the First NLI Shared
Task. Following the guidelines by the Shared Task
Organizers based on the previous literature on this
topic, Native Language Identification is tackled as
a text classification task combining NLP?enabled
feature extraction and machine learning: see e.g.
Tetreault et al (2013) and Brooke and Hirst (2012).
Interestingly, the same methodological paradigm is
shared by other tasks like e.g. author recognition and
verification (see e.g. van Halteren (2004), author-
ship attribution (see Juola (2008) for a survey), genre
identification (Mehler et al, 2011) as well as read-
ability assessment (see Dell?Orletta et al (2011a) for
an updated survey), all relying on feature extraction
from automatically parsed texts and state?of?the?art
machine learning algorithms. Besides obvious dif-
ferences at the level of the typology of selected lin-
guistic features and of learning techniques, these dif-
ferent tasks share a common approach to the prob-
lems they tackle: i.e. they succeed in determining
the language variety, the author, the text genre or the
level of readability of a text by exploiting the distri-
bution of different types of linguistic features auto-
matically extracted from texts.
Our approach to NLI relies on multi?level lin-
guistic analysis, covering morpho?syntactic tagging
and dependency parsing. In the NLI literature, the
range of features used is wide and includes char-
acteristics of the linguistic structure underlying the
L2 text, encoded in terms of sequences of charac-
ters, words, grammatical categories or of syntac-
tic constructions, as well as of the document struc-
ture: note however that, in most part of the cases,
the exploited features are task?specific. In our ap-
proach, we decided to resort to a wide set of fea-
tures ranging across different levels of linguistic de-
scription (i.e. lexical, morpho?syntactic and syntac-
tic) without any a priori selection: the same set of
features was successfully exploited in NLI?related
tasks, i.e. focusing on the linguistic form rather than
207
the content of texts, such as readability assessment
(Dell?Orletta et al, 2011a) or the classification of
textual genres (Dell?Orletta et al, 2012).
The exploitation of general features qualifying the
lexical and grammatical structure of a text, rather
than ad hoc features specifically selected for the task
at hand, is not the only peculiarity of our approach
to NLI. Following Biber (1993), we start from the
assumption that ?linguistic features from all levels
function together as underlying dimensions of vari-
ation?. This choice stems from studies on linguis-
tic variation, in particular from Biber and Conrad
(2009) who claim that linguistic varieties ? called
?registers? from a functional perspective ? differ ?in
their characteristic distributions of pervasive linguis-
tic features, not the single occurrence of an indi-
vidual feature?. This is to say that by carrying out
the linguistic analysis of collections of essays each
written by different L1 native speakers, we need to
quantify the extent to which a given feature occurs
in each collection, in order to reconstruct the lin-
guistic profile underlying each L1 collection: dif-
ferences lie at the level of the distribution of linguis-
tic features, which can be common and pervasive in
some L1 collections but comparatively rare in oth-
ers. This approach is the basis of so?called ?linguis-
tic profiling? of texts, within which ?the occurrences
of a large number of linguistic features in a text, ei-
ther individual items or combinations of items, are
counted? (van Halteren, 2004) with the final aim of
reconstructing the profile of a text.
We carried out native language identification in
two steps. The first step consisted of the identifi-
cation of the set of linguistic features characteriz-
ing the essays written by different L1 native speak-
ers, i.e. the linguistic profiling of the different sec-
tions of TOEFL11 corpus (Blanchard et al, 2013)
distributed as training and development data. In
the second step, the features which turned out to
have highly discriminative power were used for the
classification of essays written by different L1 na-
tive speakers. Essay classification has been carried
out by experimenting with different approaches: i.e.
a single?classifier method and two different multi?
model ensemble approaches.
The paper is organised as follows: after introduc-
ing the set of used linguistic features (Section 2),
Section 3 illustrates a selection of the linguistic
profiling results obtained with respect to the train-
ing section of the TOEFL11 corpus; Section 4 de-
scribes the different classification approaches we
followed and the feature selection process; in Sec-
tion 5 achieved results are reported and discussed.
2 Features
In this study, we focused on a wide set of features
ranging across different levels of linguistic descrip-
tion. Differing from previous work on NLI, no a
priori selection of features was carried out. Instead
of focusing on particular classes of errors or on dif-
ferent types of stylistic idiosyncrasies, we took into
account a wide range of features which are typically
used in studies focusing on the ?form? of a text,
e.g. on issues of genre, style, authorship or read-
ability. As previously pointed out, this represents a
peculiarity of our approach. This choice makes the
selected features language?independent, domain?
independent and reusable across different types of
tasks, as empirically demonstrated in Dell?Orletta
et al (2011a) where the same set of features has
been successfully exploited for readability assess-
ment, and in Dell?Orletta et al (2012) where the fea-
tures have been used for the classification of differ-
ent types of textual genre. Note that in both cases the
language dealt with was Italian: for the NLI Shared
Task we had to specialize the feature extraction pro-
cess with respect to the English language as well as
to the annotation scheme used to represent the un-
derlying linguistic structure.
The whole set of features we started with is de-
scribed below, organised into four main categories:
namely, raw text and lexical features as well as
morpho-syntactic and syntactic features. This pro-
posed four?fold partition closely follows the differ-
ent levels of linguistic analysis automatically car-
ried out on the text being evaluated, i.e. tokeniza-
tion, lemmatization, morpho-syntactic tagging and
dependency parsing.
2.1 Raw and Lexical Text Features
Sentence Length, calculated as the average number
of words per sentence.
Word Length, calculated as the average number of
characters per word.
Document Length, calculated as the total number
208
of words per document.
Character bigrams.
Word n-grams, including both unigrams and bi-
grams.
Type/Token Ratio: the Type/Token Ratio (TTR) is
a measure of vocabulary variation which has shown
to be a helpful measure of lexical variety within
a text as well as style marker in an authorship at-
tribution scenario: a text characterized by a low
type/token ratio will contain a great deal of repeti-
tion whereas a high type/token ratio reflects vocabu-
lary richness and variation. Due to its sensitivity to
sample size, TTR has been computed for text sam-
ples of equivalent length (the first 50 tokens).
2.2 Morpho?syntactic Features
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech n-grams: distri-
bution of unigrams and bigrams of coarse?grained
PoS, corresponding to the main grammatical cate-
gories (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
Fine grained Part-Of-Speech n-grams: distribu-
tion of unigrams and bigrams of fine?grained PoS,
which represent subdivisions of the coarse?grained
tags (e.g. the class of nouns is subdivided into proper
vs common nouns, verbs into main verbs, gerund
forms, past particles, etc.).
Verbal chunks: distribution of sequences of verbal
PoS (also including adverbs). This feature can be
seen as a proxy to capture different aspects of verbal
predication, with particular attention to idiosyncratic
usages of verbal mood, tense, person and adverbial
modification.
Lexical density: ratio of content words (verbs,
nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the total number
of lexical tokens in a text.
2.3 Syntactic Features
Dependency types n-grams: distribution of uni-
grams and bigrams of dependency types calculated
with respect to i) the hierarchical parse tree structure
and ii) the surface linear ordering of words.
Dependency triples: distribution of triplets repre-
senting a dependency relation consisting of a syn-
tactic head (h), the dependency relation type (t) and
the dependent (d). Two different variants of this fea-
ture are distinguished, based on the fact that either
the coarse?grained PoS or the word?form of h and d
is considered: we will refer to the former as Coarse
grained Part-Of-Speech dependency triples and to
the latter as Lexical dependency triples. In both
cases, the relative ordering of h and d, i.e. whether h
precedes or follows d at the level of the linear order-
ing of words within the sentence, is also considered.
Dependency Subtrees: distribution of dependency
subtrees consisting of a dependency relation (repre-
sented as the dependency triple {h, t, d}), the head
father and the dependency relation linking the two.
As in the previous case, two different variants of this
feature are distinguished, based on the fact that ei-
ther the coarse grained PoS or the word?forms of
the nodes in the dependency subtree are considered.
Parse tree depth features: this set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the parse tree
depth and includes: a) the depth of the whole parse
tree, calculated in terms of the longest path from
the root of the dependency tree to some leaf; b)
the average depth of embedded complement ?chains?
governed by a nominal head and including either
prepositional complements or nominal and adjecti-
val modifiers; c) the probability distribution of em-
bedded complement ?chains? by depth. These fea-
tures represent reliable indicators of sentence com-
plexity, as stated by, among others, Yngve (1960),
Frazier (1985) and Gibson (1998), and they can thus
allow capturing specific difficulties of L2 learners.
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech of sentence root:
this feature refers to coarse grained POS of the syn-
tactic root of a sentence.
Arity of verbal predicates: this feature refers to
the number of dependencies (corresponding to either
subcategorized arguments or modifiers) governed by
the same verbal head. In the NLI context, it can al-
low capturing improper verbal usage by L2 learners
due to language transfer (e.g. with pro?drop lan-
guages as L1).
Subordination features: this set of features is
meant to capture different aspects of the use of sub-
ordination and includes: a) the distribution of sub-
ordinate vs main clauses; b) the average depth of
?chains? of embedded subordinate clauses and c)
the probability distribution of embedded subordinate
clauses ?chains? by depth. Similarly to parse tree
depth, this set of features can be taken to reflect the
structural complexity of sentences and can thus be
indicative of specific difficulties of L2 learners.
Length of dependency links: measured in terms
209
of the words occurring between the syntactic head
and the dependent. This is another feature which
reflects the syntactic complexity of sentences (Lin,
1996; Gibson, 1998) and which can be successfully
exploited to capture syntactic idiosyncracies of L2
learners due to L1 interferences.
2.4 Other features
Two further features have been considered for NLI
purposes, which were included in the distributed
datasets. For each document, we have also consid-
ered i) the English language proficiency level (high,
medium, or low) based on human assessment by lan-
guage specialists, and ii) the topic of the essays.
3 Linguistic Profiling of TOEFL11 Corpus
In this section, we illustrate the results of linguis-
tic profiling carried out on the training and devel-
opment sets extracted from the TOEFL11 corpus.
This corpus, described in Blanchard et al (2013),
contains 1,100 essays per 11 languages (for a to-
tal of 12,100 essays) sampled as evenly as possi-
ble from 8 prompts (i.e., topics) along with score
levels (low/medium/high) for each essay. The con-
sidered L1s are: Arabic, Chinese, French, German,
Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu,
and Turkish. For the specific purposes of the NLI
Shared Task, a total of 9,900 essays has been dis-
tributed as training data (900 essays per L1), 1,100
as development data (100 per L1) and the remaining
1,100 essays have been used as test data.
We started from the automatic linguistic annota-
tion of training and development data whose output
has been searched for with respect to the features il-
lustrated in Section 2.
3.1 Linguistic Pre?processing
Both training and development data were au-
tomatically morpho-syntactically tagged by the
POS tagger described in Dell?Orletta (2009) and
dependency?parsed by the DeSR parser using
Multi?Layer Perceptron as learning algorithm (At-
tardi et al, 2009), a state?of?the?art linear?time
Shift?Reduce dependency parser. Feature extraction
is carried out against the output of the multi?level
automatic linguistic analysis carried out during the
pre?processing stage: lexical and grammatical pat-
terns corresponding to the wide typology of selected
features are looked for within each annotation layer
and quantified.
3.2 Linguistic Profiling
Generally speaking, linguistic profiling makes it
possible to identify (groups of) texts which are sim-
ilar, at least with respect to the ?profiled? features
(van Halteren, 2004). In what follows we report
the results of linguistic profiling obtained with re-
spect to the 11 L1 sub?corpora considered in this
study. Figure 1 shows the results obtained with re-
spect to a selection of the features described in Sec-
tion 2. These results refer to the combined training
and development data sets: note, however, that we
also calculated the values of these features in the two
datasets separately and it turned out that they do not
vary significantly between the two sets. This fact
can be taken as a proof both of the reliability of our
approach to linguistic profiling and of the relevance
of these features for NLI purposes.
Starting from raw textual features (Figures 1(a)
and 1(b)), both average sentence length and aver-
age word length vary significantly across L1s. In
particular, if on the one hand the essays written by
Arabic and Spanish L1 speakers contain the shortest
words and the longest sentences, on the other hand
the Hindi and Telugu L1 essays are characterized by
the longest words; the L1 Japanese and Korean cor-
pora contain the shortest sentences.
Let us focus now on the distribution of unigrams
of coarse grained Parts?Of?Speech. If we consider
the distributions of determiners and nouns, two fea-
tures typically used for NLI purposes (Wong and
Dras, 2009) which also represent stylistic markers
associated with different linguistic varieties (Biber
and Conrad, 2009), it can be noticed (see Fig-
ures 1(c) and 1(d)) that for Japanese and Korean the
essays show the lowest percentage of determiners,
while for Hindi and Telugu they are characterized
by the highest percentage of nouns.
For what concerns syntactic features, we observe
that essays by Japanese and Korean speakers are
characterized by quite a different distribution with
respect to the other L1 corpora. In particular, they
show the shallowest parse trees, the shortest depen-
dency links as well as the shortest ?chains? of em-
bedded complements governed by a nominal head.
On the other hand, the essays by Spanish and Ara-

corpus.

bic speakers contain the deepest parse trees, for Ital-
ian and Spanish we observe the longest dependency
links and for Hindi and Telugu the longest sequences
of embedded complements. Moreover, while the
essays by Italians are characterised by the highest
value of arity of verbal predicates, for Hindi, Telugu
and Korean essays much lower values are recorded.
Interestingly, these linguistic profiling results
show similar trends across the 11 languages at dif-
ferent levels of linguistic analysis. For instance, it
can be noted that Japanese and Korean or Italian
and Spanish, which belong to two different language
families, show similar distributions of features. Sim-
ilarities have also been recorded in the sub?corpora
by Hindi and Telugu speakers, even if these lan-
guages do not belong to the same family; we can
hypothesize that this might originate from language
contact phenomena.
4 System Description
4.1 Machine Learning Classifier
Our approach to Native Language Identification has
been implemented in a software prototype, i.e. a
classifier operating on mopho?syntactically tagged
and dependency parsed texts which assigns to each
document a score expressing its probability of be-
longing to a given L1 class. The highest score rep-
resents to the most probable class. Given a set of
features and a training corpus, the classifier creates a
statistical model using the feature statistics extracted
from the training corpus. This model is used in the
classification of unseen documents. The set of fea-
tures and the machine learning algorithm can be pa-
rameterized through a configuration file.
For each feature, we have implemented three dif-
ferent variants, depending on whether the feature
value is encoded in terms of: i ) presence/absence
of the feature (binary variant), ii ) the normalized
frequency (normalized frequency variant), and iii )
the normalized tf*idf value (normalized tf*idf vari-
ant). Since the binary feature variant outperformed
the other two, in all the experiments carried out on
the development set reported in Section 5 we illus-
trate the results obtained using this variant only. This
is in line with the results obtained by Brooke and
Hirst (2012) and Tetreault et al (2013). According
to (Brooke and Hirst, 2012), a possible explanation
is that ?in these relatively short texts, there is high
variability in normalized frequencies, and a simpler
metric, by having less variability, is easier for the
classifier to leverage?. Support Vector Machines
(SVM) using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) and
Maximum Entropy (ME) using MaxEnt1 have been
used as machine learning algorithms.
We experimented two classification approaches: a
single classifier method and two ensemble systems,
combining the output of several classifiers.
The single classifier uses the set of features re-
sulting from the feature selection process described
in Section 4.2 and the SVM using linear kernel as
machine learning algorithm. This choice is due to
the fact that in all the experiments the linear SVM
outperformed the SVM using polynomial kernel.
There are two possible explanations for this fact,
namely: a) the number of features is much higher
than the number of training instances, accordingly
it might not be necessary to map data to a higher
dimensional space, therefore the nonlinear mapping
does not improve the performance; b) Weston et al
(2000) showed that SVMs can indeed suffer in high
dimensional spaces where many features are irrele-
vant. Note that in Section 5, we report the results of
this classifier using different sets of features corre-
sponding to the lexical, morpho?syntactic and syn-
tactic levels of linguistic analysis.
The two ensemble systems combine the outputs
of the component classifiers following two different
strategies. The first one is based on the majority vot-
ing method (henceforth, VoteComb ): the combina-
tion strategy is seen as a classical voting problem
where for each essay is assigned the L1 class that
has been selected from the majority of classifiers. In
case of ties, the L1 class predicted from the best indi-
vidual model (as resulting from the experiments car-
ried out on the development set) is selected. The sec-
ond strategy combines the outputs of the component
classifiers via another classifier (henceforth referred
to as meta?classifier): we will refer to this second
strategy as ClassComb. The meta?classifier uses as
a feature the probability score predicted from each
component classifier for each L1 class. Differently
from the component classifiers, the meta?classifier
is based on polynomial kernel SVM. In both en-
1https://github.com/lzhang10/maxent#readme
212
semble systems, the component classifiers use linear
SVM and ME as machine learning algorithms and
exploit different sets of features among the ones re-
sulting from the feature selection process described
below.
4.2 Features Selection Process
Since our approach to NLI relies on a wide num-
ber of general?purpose features, a feature selection
process was necessary in order to prune irrelevant
and redundant features which could negatively af-
fect the classification results. The selection process
starts taking into account all the n features described
in Section 2. In each iteration, for each feature fi we
generate a configuration ci such that fi is disabled
and all the other features are enabled. When an it-
eration finishes, we obtain for each ci a correspond-
ing accuracy score score(ci) which is computed as
the average of the accuracy obtained by the classi-
fier on the development set (ad) and on an internal
development set (ai), corresponding to the 10% of
the training set, used in order to reduce the overfit-
ting risk. Being cb the best configuration among all
the ci configurations, if score(cb) ? of the accuracy
scores resulting from the previous iterations the pro-
cess stops. Otherwise:
1. store in F the pair ?fb, disabled? ;
2. for each configuration ci, if score(ci) ? of the
accuracy scores resulting from the previous it-
erations, we store in F the pair ?fi, enabled?;
3. set C = ?cb, score(cb)?
where F is a map containing elements
feature ? {disabled, enabled} and C is a
pair that contains the current best configuration cb
and the corresponding score score(cb). In each
iteration, we consider only the features which do
not occur in F . At the initialization step F is empty
and C contains the configuration where all the
considered features are enabled.
In spite of the fact that the described selection
process does not guarantee to obtain the global opti-
mum, it however permitted us to obtain an improve-
ment of about 8% with respect to the starting model
indiscriminately using all features.
Table 1 lists the features resulting from the fea-
ture selection process. It can be noted that some
Lexical features:
Word n-grams
Morpho?syntactic features:
Coarse grained Part-Of-Speech unigrams
Fine grained Part-Of-Speech bigrams
Syntactic features:
Dependency types unigrams

cess.
of them coincide with those typically used for NLI
purposes: this is the case of n?grams of words,
Parts-Of-Speech and syntactic dependencies. Inter-
estingly, to our knowledge, other features such as ar-
ity of verbal predicates, length of dependency links
as well as subordination and parse tree depth fea-
tures have not been used for NLI so far, in spite of
their being widely exploited in the syntactic com-
plexity literature (as discussed in Section 2).
5 Results
Table 2 reports the overall Accuracy achieved with
the different classifier models in the NLI classifi-
cation task on the official test set as well as the
F-measure score recorded for each L1 class. The
first two lines show the accuracies of the two com-
bination models, while the last three report the re-
sults obtained by the single classifier using i) the set
of features resulting by the features selection pro-
cess (Best Single), ii) the selected lexical features
only (see Table 1) (Lexical ) and iii) the lexical and
morpho?syntactic features (Lex+Morph ).
The two combination models outperform all
the single model classifiers: note that ClassComb
achieved much better results with respect to Vote-
Comb. By comparing these results with the F-
measure scores obtained on the distributed develop-
ment data (see Table 3), it can be seen that the rank-
ing of the scores achieved by the different classifiers
remains the same even if on the test data we obtained
a performance of -2,2% with respect to the develop-

ment test set.
Let us consider now the results obtained by the
single model classifiers. In all cases the Best Single
outperforms the other two models demonstrating the
reliability of the features selection process and that
a combination of lexical, morpho?syntactic and syn-
tactic features leads to better results.
Although the best performing model is the Class-
Comb, this is not true for all the 11 languages. In
Table 2, the best results for each L1 are bolded. In-
terestingly, even though Lexical is the worst model,
it is the best performing one for three L1s while the
best model, i.e. ClassComb, for five only.
It can be noted that with respect to the devel-
opment data set the syntactic features used by the
Best Single model allow an increment of +1% as
opposed to the Lexical model: this represents a
much higher increase if compared with the result
obtained on the test data, which is +0,4%. This is
an unexpected result since the feature selection de-
scribed in Section 4.2 was carried out on an internal
development set in order to prevent the risk of over-
fitting on the distributed development data.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we reported our participation results
to the First Native Language Identification Shared
Task. By resorting to a wide set of general?
purpose features qualifying the lexical and grammat-
ical structure of a text, rather than to ad hoc fea-
tures specifically selected for the task at hand, we
achieved encouraging results. After a feature se-
lection process, new features which to our knowl-
edge have never been exploited so far for NLI pur-
poses turned out to contribute significantly to the
task. Interestingly, the same set of features we
started from has been previously successfully ex-
ploited in other related tasks, such as readability
assessment and genre classification, operating on
the Italian language. The obtained results suggest
that our approach is general?purpose and portable
across different domains and languages. Further di-
rections of research currently include: i) comparison
of results obtained with general purpose features and
with NLI?specific features (e.g. typical errors or dif-
ferent types of stylistic idiosyncrasies specific to L2
learners), with a view to combining them to achieve
better results; ii) design and development of new en-
semble classification methods as well as new fea-
ture selection methods considering not only classes
of features but also individual features; iii) testing
our approach to NLI on different L2s (e.g. Italian) .
