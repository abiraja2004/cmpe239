Abstract? 
This paper proposes to use monolingual 
collocations to improve Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT). We make use 
of the collocation probabilities, which are 
estimated from monolingual corpora, in 
two aspects, namely improving word 
alignment for various kinds of SMT sys-
tems and improving phrase table for 
phrase-based SMT. The experimental re-
sults show that our method improves the 
performance of both word alignment and 
translation quality significantly. As com-
pared to baseline systems, we achieve ab-
solute improvements of 2.40 BLEU score 
on a phrase-based SMT system and 1.76 
BLEU score on a parsing-based SMT 
system. 
1 Introduction 
Statistical bilingual word alignment (Brown et al 
1993) is the base of most SMT systems. As com-
pared to single-word alignment, multi-word 
alignment is more difficult to be identified. Al-
though many methods were proposed to improve 
the quality of word alignments (Wu, 1997; Och 
and Ney, 2000; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Cherry 
and Lin, 2003; Liu et al, 2005; Huang, 2009), 
the correlation of the words in multi-word 
alignments is not fully considered. 
In phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al, 2003), the 
phrase boundary is usually determined based on 
the bi-directional word alignments. But as far as 
we know, few previous studies exploit the collo-
cation relations of the words in a phrase. Some 
                                                 
This work was partially done at Toshiba (China) Research 
and Development Center. 
researches used soft syntactic constraints to pre-
dict whether source phrase can be translated to-
gether (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al, 
2009). However, the constraints were learned 
from the parsed corpus, which is not available 
for many languages.  
In this paper, we propose to use monolingual 
collocations to improve SMT. We first identify 
potentially collocated words and estimate collo-
cation probabilities from monolingual corpora 
using a Monolingual Word Alignment (MWA) 
method (Liu et al, 2009), which does not need 
any additional resource or linguistic preprocess-
ing, and which outperforms previous methods on 
the same experimental data. Then the collocation 
information is employed to improve Bilingual 
Word Alignment (BWA) for various kinds of 
SMT systems and to improve phrase table for 
phrase-based SMT. 
To improve BWA, we re-estimate the align-
ment probabilities by using the collocation prob-
abilities of words in the same cept. A cept is the 
set of source words that are connected to the 
same target word (Brown et al, 1993). An 
alignment between a source multi-word cept and 
a target word is a many-to-one multi-word 
alignment. 
To improve phrase table, we calculate phrase 
collocation probabilities based on word colloca-
tion probabilities. Then the phrase collocation 
probabilities are used as additional features in 
phrase-based SMT systems. 
The evaluation results show that the proposed 
method in this paper significantly improves mul-
ti-word alignment, achieving an absolute error 
rate reduction of 29%. The alignment improve-
ment results in an improvement of 2.16 BLEU 
score on phrase-based SMT system and an im-
provement of 1.76 BLEU score on parsing-based 
SMT system. If we use phrase collocation proba-
bilities as additional features, the phrase-based 
825
SMT performance is further improved by 0.24 
BLEU score. 
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, 
we introduce the collocation model based on the 
MWA method. In section 3 and 4, we show how 
to improve the BWA method and the phrase ta-
ble using collocation models respectively. We 
describe the experimental results in section 5, 6 
and 7. Lastly, we conclude in section 8. 
2 Collocation Model 
Collocation is generally defined as a group of 
words that occur together more often than by 
chance (McKeown and Radev, 2000). A colloca-
tion is composed of two words occurring as ei-
ther a consecutive word sequence or an inter-
rupted word sequence in sentences, such as "by 
accident" or "take ... advice". In this paper, we 
use the MWA method (Liu et al, 2009) for col-
location extraction. This method adapts the bi-
lingual word alignment algorithm to monolingual 
scenario to extract collocations only from mono-
lingual corpora. And the experimental results in 
(Liu et al, 2009) showed that this method 
achieved higher precision and recall than pre-
vious methods on the same experimental data. 
2.1 Monolingual word alignment 
The monolingual corpus is first replicated to 
generate a parallel corpus, where each sentence 
pair consists of two identical sentences in the 
same language. Then the monolingual word 
alignment algorithm is employed to align the 
potentially collocated words in the monolingual 
sentences. 
According to Liu et al (2009), we employ the 
MWA Model 3 (corresponding to IBM Model 3) 
to calculate the probability of the monolingual 
word alignment sequence, as shown in Eq. (1).

In the MWA method, the similar algorithm to 
bilingual word alignment is used to estimate the 
parameters of the models, except that a word 
cannot be aligned to itself.  
Figure 1 shows an example of the potentially 
collocated word pairs aligned by the MWA me-
thod.

2.2 Collocation probability 
Given the monolingual word aligned corpus, we 
calculate the frequency of two words aligned in 
the corpus, denoted as ),( ji wwfreq . We filtered 
the aligned words occurring only once. Then the 
probability for each aligned word pair is esti-
mated as follows:

In this paper, the words of collocation are 
symmetric and we do not determine which word 
is the head and which word is the modifier. Thus, 
the collocation probability of two words is de-
fined as the average of both probabilities, as in 
Eq. (4).

3 Improving Statistical Bilingual Word 
Alignment 
We use the collocation information to improve 
both one-directional and bi-directional bilingual 
word alignments. The alignment probabilities are 
re-estimated by using the collocation probabili-
ties of words in the same cept.

3.1 Improving one-directional bilingual 
word alignment 
According to the BWA method, given a bilingual 
sentence pair leE 1?  and mfF 1? , the optimal 
alignment sequence A  between E and F can be 
obtained as in Eq. (6). 
)|,(maxarg* EAFpA A?
                   (6) 
The method is implemented in a series of five 
models (IBM Models). IBM Model 1 only em-
ploys the word translation model to calculate the 
probabilities of alignments. In IBM Model 2, 
both the word translation model and position dis-
tribution model are used. IBM Model 3, 4 and 5 
consider the fertility model in addition to the 
word translation model and position distribution 
model. And these three models are similar, ex-
cept for the word distortion models. 
One-to-one and many-to-one alignments could 
be produced by using IBM models. Although the 
fertility model is used to restrict the number of 
source words in a cept and the position distortion 
model is used to describe the correlation of the 
positions of the source words, the quality of 
many-to-one alignments is lower than that of 
one-to-one alignments. 
Intuitively, the probability of the source words 
aligned to a target word is not only related to the 
fertility ability and their relative positions, but 
also related to lexical tokens of words, such as 
common phrase or idiom. In this paper, we use 
the collocation probability of the source words in 
a cept to measure their correlation strength. Giv-
en source words }|{ iaf jj ?  aligned to ie , their 
collocation probability is calculated as in Eq. (7).

Based on the GIZA++ package 1 , we imple-
mented a tool for the improved BWA method. 
We first train IBM Model 4 and collocation 
model on bilingual corpus and monolingual cor-
pus respectively. Then we employ the hill-
climbing algorithm (Al-Onaizan et al, 1999) to 
search for the optimal alignment sequence of a 
given sentence pair, where the score of an align-
ment sequence is calculated as in Eq. (10). 
We note that Eq. (8) only deals with many-to-
one alignments, but the alignment sequence of a 
sentence pair also includes one-to-one align-
ments. To calculate the collocation probability of 
the alignment sequence, we should also consider 
the collocation probabilities of such one-to-one 
alignments. To solve this problem, we use the 
collocation probability of the whole source sen-
tence, )(Fr , as the collocation probability of 
one-word cept. 
3.2 Improving bi-directional bilingual word 
alignments 
In word alignment models implemented in GI-
ZA++, only one-to-one and many-to-one word 
alignment links can be found. Thus, some multi-
word units cannot be correctly aligned. The 
symmetrization method is used to effectively 
overcome this deficiency (Och and Ney, 2003). 
Bi-directional alignments are generally obtained 
from source-to-target algnments 
tsA 2  and target-
to-source alignments 
stA 2 , using some heuristic 
rules (Koehn et al, 2005). This method ignores 
the correlation of the words in the same align-
ment unit, so an alignment may include many 
unrelated words2 , which influences the perfor-
mances of SMT systems. 
                                                 
1 http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html 
2 In our experiments, a multi-word unit may include up to 
40 words. 
827
In order to solve the above problem, we incor-
porate the collocation probabilities into the bi-
directional word alignment process. 
Given alignment sets 
tsA 2  and stA 2 . We can 
obtain the union 
sttsts AAA 22 ??? . The source 
sentence mf1  can be segmented into m?  cepts 
mf ?1 . The target sentence le1  can also be seg-
mented into l ?  cepts le ?1 . The words in the same 
cept can be a consecutive word sequence or an 
interrupted word sequence. 
Finally, the optimal alignments A  between 
mf ?1  and le ?1  can be obtained from tsA ?  using the 
following decision rule.

4 Improving Phrase Table 
Phrase-based SMT system automatically extracts 
bilingual phrase pairs from the word aligned bi-
lingual corpus. In such a system, an idiomatic 
expression may be split into several fragments, 
and the phrases may include irrelevant words. In 
this paper, we use the collocation probability to 
measure the possibility of words composing a 
phrase. 
For each bilingual phrase pair automatically 
extracted from word aligned corpus, we calculate 
the collocation probabilities of source phrase and 
target phrase respectively, according to Eq. (13).

tem as features.  
5 Experiments on Word Alignment 
5.1 Experimental settings 
We use a bilingual corpus, FBIS (LDC2003E14), 
to train the IBM models. To train the collocation 
models, besides the monolingual parts of FBIS, 
we also employ some other larger Chinese and 
English monolingual corpora, namely, Chinese 
Gigaword (LDC2007T38), English Gigaword 
(LDC2007T07), UN corpus (LDC2004E12), Si-
norama corpus (LDC2005T10), as shown in Ta-
ble 1. 
Using these corpora, we got three kinds of col-
location models: 
CM-1: the training data is the additional mo-
nolingual corpora; 
CM-2: the training data is either side of the bi-
lingual corpus; 
CM-3: the interpolation of CM-1 and CM-2. 
To investigate the quality of the generated 
word alignments, we randomly selected a subset 
from the bilingual corpus as test set, including 
500 sentence pairs. Then word alignments in the 
subset were manually labeled, referring to the 
guideline of the Chinese-to-English alignment 
(LDC2006E93), but we made some modifica-
tions for the guideline. For example, if a preposi-
tion appears after a verb as a phrase aligned to 
one single word in the corresponding sentence, 
then they are glued together. 
There are several different evaluation metrics 
for word alignment (Ahrenberg et al, 2000). We 
use precision (P), recall (R) and alignment error 
ratio (AER), which are similar to those in Och 
and Ney (2000), except that we consider each 
alignment as a sure link.

In order to tune the interpolation coefficients 
in Eq. (5) and the weights of the probabilities in 
Eq. (11), we also manually labeled a develop-
ment set including 100 sentence pairs, in the 
same manner as the test set. By minimizing the 
AER on the development set, the interpolation 
coefficients of the collocation probabilities on 
CM-1 and CM-2 were set to 0.1 and 0.9. And the 
weights of probabilities were set as 6.01 ?? , 
2.02 ?? and 2.03 ?? . 
5.2 Evaluation results 
One-directional alignment results 
To train a Chinese-to-English SMT system, 
we need to perform both Chinese-to-English and 
English-to-Chinese word alignment. We only 
evaluate the English-to-Chinese word alignment 
here. GIZA++ with the default settings is used as 
the baseline method. The evaluation results in 
Table 2 indicate that the performances of our 
methods on single word alignments are close to 
that of the baseline method. For multi-word 
alignments, our methods significantly outper-
form the baseline method in terms of both preci-
sion and recall, achieving up to 18% absolute 
error rate reduction. 
Although the size of the bilingual corpus is 
much smaller than that of additional monolingual 
corpora, our methods using CM-1 and CM-2 
achieve comparable performances. It is because 
CM-2 and the BWA model are derived from the 
same resource. By interpolating CM1 and CM2, 
i.e. CM-3, the error rate of multi-word alignment 
results is further reduced. 
Figure 2 shows an example of word alignment 
results generated by the baseline method and the 
improved method using CM-3. In this example, 
our method successfully identifies many-to-one 
alignments such as "the people of the world  
??". In our collocation model, the collocation 
probability of "the people of the world" is much 
higher than that of "people world". And our me-
thod is also effective to prevent the unrelated

baseline alignment "has made ... have ??", 
"have" and "has" are unrelated to the target word, 
while our method only generated "made  ?
?", this is because that the collocation probabili-
ties of "has/have" and "made" are much lower 
than that of the whole source sentence. 
Bi-directional alignment results 
We build a bi-directional alignment baseline 
in two steps: (1) GIZA++ is used to obtain the 
source-to-target and target-to-source alignments; 
(2) the bi-directional alignments are generated by 
using "grow-diag-final". We use the methods 
proposed in section 3 to replace the correspond-
ing steps in the baseline method. We evaluate 
three methods:  
WA-1: one-directional alignment method pro-
posed in section 3.1 and grow-diag-final; 
WA-2: GIZA++ and the bi-directional bilin-
gual word alignments method proposed in 
section 3.2; 
WA-3: both methods proposed in section 3. 
Here, CM-3 is used in our methods. The re-
sults are shown in Table 3. 
We can see that WA-1 achieves lower align-
ment error rate as compared to the baseline me-
thod, since the performance of the improved one-
directional alignment method is better than that 
of GIZA++. This result indicates that improving 
one-directional word alignment results in bi-
directional word alignment improvement. 
The results also show that the AER of WA-2 
is lower than that of the baseline. This is because 
the proposed bi-directional alignment method 
can effectively recognize the correct alignments 
from the alignment union, by leveraging colloca-
tion probabilities of the words in the same cept. 
Our method using both methods proposed in 
section 3 produces the best alignment perfor-
mance, achieving 11% absolute error rate reduc-
tion.

6 Experiments on Phrase-Based SMT 
6.1 Experimental settings 
We use FBIS corpus to train the Chinese-to-
English SMT systems. Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) 
is used as the baseline phrase-based SMT system. 
We use SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 
2002) to train a 5-gram language model on the 
English sentences of FBIS corpus. We used the 
NIST MT-2002 set as the development set and 
the NIST MT-2004 test set as the test set. And 
Koehn's implementation of minimum error rate 
training (Och, 2003) is used to tune the feature 
weights on the development set. 
We use BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) as eval-
uation metrics. We also calculate the statistical 
significance differences between our methods 
and the baseline method by using paired boot-
strap re-sample method (Koehn, 2004). 
6.2 Effect of improved word alignment on 
phrase-based SMT 
We investigate the effectiveness of the improved 
word alignments on the phrase-based SMT sys-
tem. The bi-directional alignments are obtained

models for translation quality improvement. The 
results are shown in Table 4. 
From the results of Table 4, it can be seen that 
the systems using the improved bi-directional 
alignments achieve higher quality of translation 
than the baseline system. If the same alignment 
method is used, the systems using CM-3 got the 
highest BLEU scores. And if the same colloca-
tion model is used, the systems using WA-3 
achieved the higher scores. These results are 
consistent with the evaluations of word align-
ments as shown in Tables 2 and 3. 
6.3 Effect of phrase collocation probabili-
ties 
To investigate the effectiveness of the method 
proposed in section 4, we only use the colloca-
tion model CM-3 as described in section 5.1. The 
results are shown in Table 5. When the phrase 
collocation probabilities are incorporated into the 
SMT system, the translation quality is improved, 
achieving an absolute improvement of 0.85 
BLEU score. This result indicates that the collo-
cation probabilities of phrases are useful in de-
termining the boundary of phrase and predicting 
whether phrases should be translated together, 
which helps to improve the phrase-based SMT 
performance. 
Figure 3 shows an example: T1 is generated 
by the system where the phrase collocation prob-
abilities are used and T2 is generated by the 
baseline system. In this example, since the collo-
cation probability of "? ??" is much higher 
than that of "?? ?", our method tends to split 
"? ?? ?" into "(? ??) (?)", rather than 
"(?) (?? ?)". For the phrase "?? ??" in 
the source sentence, the collocation probability 
of the translation "in order to avoid" is higher 
than that of the translation "can we avoid". Thus, 
our method selects the former as the translation. 
Although the phrase "?? ?? ?? ?? ?
?" in the source sentence has the same transla-
tion "We must adopt effective measures", our 
method splits this phrase into two parts "?? ?
?" and "?? ?? ??", because two parts 
have higher collocation probabilities than the 
whole phrase. 
We also investigate the performance of the 
system employing both the word alignment im-
provement and phrase table improvement me-
thods. From the results in Table 5, it can be seen 
that the quality of translation is future improved. 
As compared with the baseline system, an abso-
lute improvement of 2.40 BLEU score is 
achieved. And this result is also better than  the 
results shown in Table 4. 
7 Experiments on Parsing-Based SMT 
We also investigate the effectiveness of the im-
proved word alignments on the parsing-based 
SMT system, Joshua (Li et al, 2009). In this sys-
tem, the Hiero-style SCFG model is used 
(Chiang, 2007), without syntactic information. 
The rules are extracted only based on the FBIS 
corpus, where words are aligned by "MW-3 & 
CM-3". And the language model is the same as 
that in Moses. The feature weights are tuned on 
the development set using the minimum error

The translation results on Joshua are shown in 
Table 6. The system using the improved word 
alignments achieves an absolute improvement of 
1.76 BLEU score, which indicates that the im-
provements of word alignments are also effective 
to improve the performance of the parsing-based 
SMT systems. 
8 Conclusion 
We presented a novel method to use monolingual 
collocations to improve SMT. We first used the 
MWA method to identify potentially collocated 
words and estimate collocation probabilities only 
from monolingual corpora, no additional re-
source or linguistic preprocessing is needed. 
Then the collocation information was employed 
to improve BWA for various kinds of SMT sys-
tems and to improve phrase table for phrase-
based SMT. 
To improve BWA, we re-estimate the align-
ment probabilities by using the collocation prob-
abilities of words in the same cept. To improve 
phrase table, we calculate phrase collocation 
probabilities based on word collocation probabil-
ities. Then the phrase collocation probabilities 
are used as additional features in phrase-based 
SMT systems. 
The evaluation results showed that the pro-
posed method significantly improved word 
alignment, achieving an absolute error rate re-
duction of 29% on multi-word alignment. The 
improved word alignment results in an improve-
ment of 2.16 BLEU score on a phrase-based 
SMT system and an improvement of 1.76 BLEU 
score on a parsing-based SMT system. When we 
also used phrase collocation probabilities as ad-
ditional features, the phrase-based SMT perfor-
mance is finally improved by 2.40 BLEU score 
as compared with the baseline system.
