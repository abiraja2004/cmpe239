Abstract
Likey is an unsupervised statistical ap-
proach for keyphrase extraction. The
method is language-independent and the
only language-dependent component is
the reference corpus with which the doc-
uments to be analyzed are compared.
In this study, we have also used an-
other language-dependent component: an
English-specific Porter stemmer as a pre-
processing step. In our experiments
of keyphrase extraction from scientific
articles, the Likey method outperforms
both supervised and unsupervised baseline
methods.
1 Introduction
Keyphrase extraction is a natural language pro-
cessing task for collecting the main topics of a
document into a list of phrases. Keyphrases are
supposed to be available in the processed docu-
ments themselves, and the aim is to extract these
most meaningful words and phrases from the doc-
uments. Keyphrase extraction summarises the
content of a document as few phrases and thus
provides a quick way to find out what the docu-
ment is about. Keyphrase extraction is a basic text
mining procedure that can be used as a ground
for other, more sophisticated text analysis meth-
ods. Automatically extracted keyphrases may be
used to improve the performance of information
retrieval, automatic user model generation, docu-
ment collection clustering and visualisation, sum-
marisation and question-answering, among others.
This article describes the participation of the
Likey method in the Task 5 of the SemEval 2010
challenge, automatic keyphrase extraction from
scientific articles (Kim et al, 2010).
1.1 Related work
In statistical keyphrase extraction, many variations
for term frequency counts have been proposed in
the literature including relative frequencies (Dam-
erau, 1993), collection frequency (Hulth, 2003),
term frequency?inverse document frequency (tf-
idf) (Salton and Buckley, 1988), among others.
Additional features to frequency that have been
experimented are e.g., relative position of the first
occurrence of the term (Frank et al, 1999), im-
portance of the sentence in which the term oc-
curs (HaCohen-Kerner, 2003), and widely stud-
ied part-of-speech tag patterns, e.g. Hulth (2003).
Matsuo and Ishizuka (2004) present keyword ex-
traction method using word co-occurrence statis-
tics. An unsupervised keyphrase extraction
method by Liu et al (2009) uses clustering to find
exemplar terms that are then used for keyphrase
extraction. Most of the presented methods require
a reference corpus or a training corpus to produce
keyphrases. Statistical keyphrase extraction meth-
ods without reference corpora have also been pro-
posed, e.g. (Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Bracewell
et al, 2005). The later study is carried out for
bilingual corpus.
2 Data
The data used in this work are from the SemEval
2010 challenge Task 5, automatic keyphrase ex-
traction from scientific articles. The data consist
of train, trial, and test data sets. The number of
scientific articles and the total number of word to-
kens in each of the original data sets (before pre-
processing) are given in Table 1.
Three sets of ?correct? keyphrases are pro-
vided for each article in each data set: reader-
assigned keyphrases, author-provided keyphrases,
and a combination of them. All reader-assigned
keyphrases have been extracted manually from
the papers whereas some of author-provided

3 Methods
Likey keyphrase extraction approach comes
from the tradition of statistical machine learn-
ing (Paukkeri et al, 2008). The method has
been developed to be as language-independent as
possible. The only language-specific component
needed is a corpus in each language. This kind
of data is readily available online or from other
sources.
Likey selects the words and phrases that best
crystallize the meaning of the documents by com-
paring ranks of frequencies in the documents to
those in the reference corpus. The Likey ra-
tio (Paukkeri et al, 2008) for each phrase is de-
fined as
L(p, d) =
rank
d
(p)
rank
r
(p)
, (1)
where rank
d
(p) is the rank value of phrase p in
document d and rank
r
(p) is the rank value of
phrase p in the reference corpus. The rank val-
ues are calculated according to the frequencies of
phrases of the same length n. If the phrase p does
not exist in the reference corpus, the value of the
maximum rank for phrases of length n is used:
rank
r
(p) = max rank
r
(n) + 1. The Likey ra-
tio orders the phrases in a document in such a way
that the phrases that have the smallest ratio are the
best candidates for being a keyphrase.
As a post-processing step, the phrases of length
n > 1 face an extra removal process: if one of
the words composing the phrase has a rank of less
than a threshold ? in the reference corpus, the
phrase is removed from the keyphrase list. This
procedure excludes phrases that contain function
words such as ?of? or ?the?. As another post-
processing step, phrases that are subphrases of
those that have occurred earlier on the keyphrase
list are removed, excluding e.g. ?language model?
if ?unigram language model? has been already ac-
cepted as a keyphrase.
3.1 Reference corpus
Likey needs a reference corpus that is seen as a
sample of the general language. In the present
study, we use a combination of the English part of
Europarl, European Parliament plenary speeches
(Koehn, 2005) and the preprocessed training set as
the reference corpus. All XML tags of meta infor-
mation are excluded from the Europarl data. The
size of the Europarl corpus is 35 800 000 words
after removal of XML tags.
3.2 Preprocessing
The scientific articles are preprocessed by remov-
ing all headers including the names and addresses
of the authors. Also the reference section is re-
moved from the articles, as well as all tables, fig-
ures, equations and citations. Both scientific arti-
cles and the Europarl data is lowercased, punctua-
tion is removed (the hyphens surrounded by word
characters and apostrophes are kept) and the num-
bers are changed to <NUM> tag.
The data is stemmed with English Porter stem-
mer implementation provided by the challenge or-
ganizers, which differs from our earlier experi-
ments.
3.3 Baselines
We use three baseline methods for keyphrase ex-
traction. The baselines use uni-, bi-, and trigrams
as candidates of keyphrases with tf-idf weight-
ing scheme. One of the baselines is unsuper-
vised and the other two are supervised approaches.
The unsupervised method is to rank the candidates
according to their tf-idf scores. The supervised
methods are Na??ve Bayes (NB) and Maximum En-
tropy (ME) implementations from WEKA pack-
age1.

4 Experiments
We participated the challenge with Likey results of
three different parameter settings. The settings are
given in Table 3. Likey-1 has phrases up to 3 words
and Likey-2 and Likey-3 up to 4 words. The thresh-
old value for postprocessing was selected against
the trial set, with ? = 100 performing best. It
is used for Likey-1 and Likey-2. Also a bit larger
threshold ? = 130 was tried for Likey-3 to exclude
more function words.

Likey-2 1?4 100

An example of the resulting keyphrases ex-
tracted by Likey-1 from the first scientific arti-
cle in the test set (article C-1) is given in Ta-
ble 4. Also the corresponding ?correct? answers in
reader-assigned and author-provided answer sets
are shown. The keyphrases are given in stemmed
versions. Likey keyphrases that can be found in the
reader or author answer sets are emphasized.

Table 4: Extracted keyphrases by Likey-1 from ar-
ticle C-1 and the corresponding correct answers in
reader and author answer sets.
The example shows clearly that many of the ex-
tracted keyphrases contain the same words that
can be found in the correct answer sets but the
length of the phrases vary and thus they cannot be
counted as successfully extracted keyphrases.
The results for the three different Likey
parametrizations and the three baselines are given
in Table 5 for reader-assigned keyphrases and Ta-
ble 6 for the combined set of reader and author-
assigned keyphrases. The evaluation is conducted
by calculating precision (P), recall (R) and F-
measure (F) for top 5, 10, and 15 keyphrase candi-
dates for each method, using the reader-assigned
and author-provided lists as correct answers. The
baseline methods are unsupervised tf-idf and su-
pervised Na??ve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy
(ME).
Likey-1 performed best in the competition and
is thus selected as the official result of Likey in the
task. Anyway, all Likey parametrizations outper-
form the baselines, Likey-1 having the best pre-
cision 24.60% for top-5 candidates in the reader
data set and 29.20% for top-5 candidates in the
combined data set. The best F-measure is obtained
with Likey-1 for top-10 candidates for both reader
and combined data set: 16.24% and 17.11%,
respectively. Likey seems to produce the best
keyphrases in the beginning of the keyphrase list:
for reader-assigned keyphrases the top 5 keyphrase
precision for Likey-1 is 6.8 points better than
the best-performing baseline tf-idf and the cor-
responding F-measure is 4.0 points better. For
the combined set, the numbers are 7.2 and 3.7
points, respectively. The difference decreases for
the larger keyphrase sets.
5 Conclusions and discussion
This article describes our submission to SemEval
2010 Task 5, keyphrase extraction from scien-
tific articles. Our unsupervised and language-
independent method Likey uses reference corpus
and is able to outperform both the unsupervised
and supervised baseline methods. The best results
are obtained with the top-5 keyphrases: precision
of 24.60% with reader-assigned keyphrases and
29.20% with the combination of reader-assigned
and author-provided keyphrases.
There are some keyphrases in the answer sets
that our method does not find: due to the com-
paratively large threshold value ? many phrases
that contain function words, e.g. ?of?, cannot be
found. We also extract keyphrases of maximum
length of three or four words and thus cannot find
keyphrases longer than that. The next step of this
research would be to take these problems into ac-
count.
