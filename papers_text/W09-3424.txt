Abstract
The paper gives an overview of some of
the major primary resources and appli-
cations developed in the field of Natural
Language Processing(NLP) for the Nepali
language and their prospective for build-
ing advanced NLP applications. The pa-
per also sheds light on the approaches fol-
lowed by the current applications and their
coverage as well as limitations.
1 Introduction
NLP is a relatively new area of involvement in
the context of Nepal.The first ever NLP works
in Nepal include the Nepali Spell Checker and
Thesaurus that got released in the year 2005.
The years after that saw an increasing amount
of Research and Development of NLP resources
and applications under different programs.This in-
cluded Dobhase1, an English to Nepali Machine
Translation System, Stemmer and Morphological
Analyzer, Parts-of-Speech(POS) Tagger, Chunker,
Parser, a corpus-based on-line Nepali monolin-
gual dictionary, Text-To-Speech etc. On the re-
sources front, by 2008, we have had developed a
Lexicon, Nepali Written Corpus,Parallel Corpus,
POS Tagset,Speech Recordings etc. In the sec-
tions that follow, we will be discussing over the
current achievements and the possible advanced
applications that can be developed on the basis of
the existing resources and applications.
2 Resources
2.1 Nepali Lexicon
The process of the development of the Nepali
Lexicon(Bista et al,2004-2007;2004-2007a) un-
derwent several changes as the purpose of the lex-
icon was not very clear in the beginning.No doubt,
1http://nlp.ku.edu.np/cgi-bin/dobhase
we were aware that the usage of a lexicon would
be basically a multi-purpose one, fitting to one or
more NLP applications but we were a bit unsure
about the actual format of the lexicon.As a result,
the entries of the lexicon were maintained in dif-
ferent file formats ranging from plain spreadsheets
to XML formatted data files. In the beginning, the
attributes of the lexicon were decided to be as:
? Rootword
? Headword
? Pronunciation
? Syllablebreak
? Meaning
? PartsofSpeech
? Synonym
? Idiom
But later on, owing to time constraints and also
taking into consideration the applicability of the
lexicon to some of the immediate NLP applica-
tions being developed like the Spell Checker and
the Stemmer/Morphological Analyzer, the entries
were just made for the attributes - Rootword and
PartsofSpeech. The file format was also fixed for
the plain spreadsheet one, keeping into considera-
tion the discomfort faced by the linguists and data
entry persons with the XML data format.The lat-
est size of the lexicon is 37,000 root words with
their parts of speech category specified. Wherever
more than one category is possible, multiple cat-
egories have been entered with the comma as the
separator.
2.2 Nepali POS Tagset
The Nepali POS Tagset designed in the begin-
ning consisted of 112 tags2. These tags were
2http://www.bhashasanchar.org/pdfs/nelralec-wp-
tagset.pdf
165
used to manually and semi-automatically anno-
tate the written corpus as well. Experiences, how-
ever, showed that error rates of annotation could
be much higher when the size of the tagset was a
big one, the reason primarily being the chances of
assigning incorrect tags to the words out of con-
fusion while manually annotating the the train-
ing data itself. It was with such motivations that
a smaller sized POS Tagset3 was later on devel-
oped that consists of just 43 tags. While develop-
ing the tagset, maximum care has been taken to
ensure that this minimalist approach does not un-
necessarily eliminate the unavoidable lexical cate-
gories of the language. The design of this Nepali
POS Tagset was inspired by the PENN Treebank
POS Tagset.Hence, whenever possible, the same
naming convention has been used as in the case of
the PENN Treebank Tagset. In Table 1, we pro-
vide the summary of the small sized POS Tagset.
Owing to space constraints, we have just provided
limited examples for each of the POS category.
2.3 Nepali Written Corpus
Different efforts have been put into developing the
Nepali Written Corpus. We try to provide a brief
overview on each of them below.
With an aim to facilitate linguistic and computa-
tional/corpus linguistic researches of the Nepali
language,the compilation of different text cor-
pora got initiated under the activity, Nepali Na-
tional Corpus4. The Nepali National Corpus ba-
sically consists of three different types of corpora,
namely, the Written Corpus(monolingual and par-
allel), the Spoken Corpus and the Speech Corpus.
The monolingual Nepali Written Corpus was fur-
ther sub-divided into two types - the Core Cor-
pus and the General Corpus. The Core Corpus
consists of 398 texts from about 15 different gen-
res and amounting to 1 million words, has been
collected from different books,journals,magazines
and newspapers. The texts belong to the time pe-
riod between 1990 and 1992. The Core Corpus
has been converted into XML file format. In ad-
dition, the text has been annotated using the 112
Tagset. The General Corpus,on the other hand, is
a collection of the written texts basically from the

Nepali Language Resources and Localization for Education
and Communication(NeLRaLEC)Project.For details, please

internet. The collected texts amount to a size of 14
million words. Both the Core Corpus and the Gen-
eral Corpus above have been developed following
the internationally accepted FLOB and FROWN
framework for collecting text corpus.
Another set of collection under the Written Corpus
is the Parallel Corpus. The Parallel Corpus con-
sists of collections from two genres - computing
and national development. The one on comput-
ing sizes to be 3 million words of English-Nepali
parallel texts whereas the other one on national de-
velopment amounts to about 966,203 words.
In another bid, a Nepali Corpora parallel to
100,000 words of common English source from
PENN Treebank corpus, available through the
Linguistic Data Consortium(LDC)has been devel-
oped5.This Parallel Corpus has been also POS
Tagged with the 43 POS Tagset as presented in Ta-
ble 1.
2.4 Nepali Spoken Corpus
The Spoken Corpora has been designed on the
basis of the Goteborg Spoken Language Cor-
pus(GSLC). The Corpora have been collected
from 17 social activities and contain about
2,60,000 words. These texts are audio-video
recordings of the activities with their correspond-
ing transcriptions and annotations about the par-
ticipant?s information. Each activity is stored in
three separate files (.mpeg, .txt and .doc) respec-
tively for recording,transcription and recording in-
formation.
2.5 Nepali Speech Corpus
The Speech Corpus is a specialized recordings
of speech developed for the Nepali Text-To-
Speech(TTS) application for enabling the software
to speak Nepali from written texts.It consists of
1,880 sentences and 6053 words, extracted from
the Core Corpus and later recorded in male and
female voices. The recordings are approximately
of 3-4 hours.
3 Applications
3.1 Nepali Thesaurus
For developing the Nepali Thesaurus, we have
used the MyThes framework6 developed by Kevin
5This work has been developed with the support from the
Language Resource Association (GSK) of Japan and Inter-
national Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada,
through the PAN Localization Project(www.PANL10n.net)
6http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/MyThes-1.zip
Hendricks. MyThes is incorporated with the
OpenOffice.org suite.Originally, it did not sup-
port UTF-8 encoding but the support has been
enabled after OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 onwards.The
Nepali Thesaurus currently contains 5,500 entries
with the attributes - POS Tag, Meaning and Syn-
onym. This application has been released as an
inbuilt package with OpenOffice.org Writer local-
ized into Nepali for public usage since 2005.
3.2 Nepali Spell Checker
The Nepali Spell Checker follows the Hunspell
framework7. In essence, Hunspell is a spell
checker and morphological library.It is included
in OpenOffice.org suite 2.0 onwards by default.
Recently,it has also been adopted by the Google
Search Engine as it?s default Spell Checker. De-
pending upon the language specific terriotory,
HunSpell may be customized by using the con-
cerned locale file. HunSpell requires two files8,
respectively the dictionary file that contains the
words for the language and the affix file that
has rules associated to the words in the dictio-
nary by using flags serving as pointers. The
two files should be located in the folder openof-
ficefolder/share/dic/ooo/. Spell checking is done
using the affix file, locale and the dictionary
file.While the affix file consists of affix rules, the
dictionary file consists of root words. At the
moment,the size of the dictionary file is about
37,000 entries whereas we have about 1,800 af-
fix rules in the affix file. The word coverage
in terms of spell checking is 6.2 million Nepali
words. Random tests of the spell checker yielded
accuracies of 90%(43 words unhandled out of
450 words),94%(25 words unhandled out of 400
words),89% accuracy(100 words unhandled out of
923 words) etc. By saying unhandled, we refer to
the situation whereby the incorrect words are not
provided appropriate suggestions.
3.3 Dobhase - English to Nepali Machine
Translation System
With a view to aid to the majority of English un-
proficient Nepalis to some extent, this application
was developed under a joint collaboration between
Kathmandu University and Madan Puraskar Pus-
takalaya.The software currently is able to provide
gist translations to simple declarative sentences.It
7http://hunspell.sourceforge.net
8The two files for Nepali is available at
http://nepalinux.org/downloads/ne NP dict.zip
167
is a rule and transfer-based Machine Translation
System. More information on the software is
available at http://nlp.ku.edu.np/
3.4 The Online Nepali Dictionary
A Corpus based Online Nepali Dictionary has
been developed for Nepali and is available in the
following link http://nepalisabdakos.com
This dictionary differs from the existing ones(both
hard and soft copy versions) in that this dictionary
contains examples and meanings from the corpus
itself. The XIARA software has been used to look
for wordlists and concordances in due course of
compiling the dictionary. The dictionary currently
contains about 8,000 entries .
3.5 The Nepali Text-To-Speech
The Nepali Text-To-Speech Application has been
developed following the Festival Speech Synthe-
sis System.Currently, the Nepali Text-To-Speech
works just in the Linux environment and has the
basic capabilities of reading text from files.One
may opt to hear the texts either from a male
or a female voice.The application has been
deemed useful not only to visually impaired
but also to illiterates.Lately, there has been a
growing demand of the application for extend-
ing it to a screen reader and making it work in
cross-platforms.For more information, please visit
http://bhashasanchar.org/textspeech intro.php
3.6 Conversion Tools
Keeping into consideration that a lot of texts
both in the government and the general pub-
lic are still encoded in ASCII-based Nepali non-
unicode fonts,we have developed the Conver-
sion Tools both for converting non-unicode texts
to unicode and vice versa.For details,please visit
http://madanpuraskar.org/ Our efforts in the devel-
opment of the tool have been supplemented by
the Open Source Community as well.The latest
information on the extended work is available at
http://code.google.com/p/nepaliconverter/
3.7 The Nepali Stemmer and the
Morphological Analyzer
The Nepali Stemmer and the Morphological Ana-
lyzer combines the results of the Stemmer and the
Morphological Analyzer in the sense that besides
producing the stem or root of any word, the as-
sociated bound morphemes and their grammatical
category are also kept track of. The Nepali Stem-
mer and Morphological Analyzer is a rule-based
one and makes use of the following resources:
? Free morpheme based lexicon
? Affix file or bound morpheme list
? Database of word breaking rules
The free morpheme based lexicon consists
of free or unbound morphemes of the Nepali
language together with their respective parts-
of-speech information. Similarly, the affix file
or bound morpheme list contains the prefix
and the suffixes in Nepali.These affixes are
further associated with numbers which point to
the corresponding word breaking rules.Finally,
the word breaking rules database basically
represent the insertion and deletion rules appli-
cable once a word breaks down into the root
and the respective affixes. The application,
which is still at a prototypical stage, is available at
http://nepalinux.org/downloads/nlp/stemmer ma.zip
3.8 The Nepali Computational Grammar
Analyzer
The Nepali Computational Grammar Analyzer
is an attempt to develop a basic computational
framework for analyzing the correctness of a
given input sentence in the Nepali language.
While the primary objective remains in building
such a framework, the secondary objective lies in
developing intermediate standalone NLP modules
like the POS Tagger,chunker and the parser.In
Figure 1, we present the system architecture of
the Nepali Computational Grammar Analyzer.
Talking about the individual modules,for the POS
Tagger,we have used TNT9,a very efficient and
state-of-the-art statistical POS tagger and trained
it with around 82000 Nepali words.Currently
the accuracy of the trained TnT POS Tagger for
Nepali is 56% for unknown words and 97% for
known words.
Similarly,for the chunker module, we have devel-
oped a hand-crafted linguistic chunk rules and a
simple algorithm to process these rules.Currently,
we have around 30 chunk rules, which have
to be further optimized for better coverage and
output.The chunkset consists of 11 chunk tags at
the moment.
For the parser module, we have implemented
9http://coli.uni-saarland.de/ thorsten/tnt/
168
a constraint-based parser following the depen-
dency grammar formalism10 and in particular
the Paninian Grammar framework(Bharati et
al.,1993,1995;Pederson et al,2004).A depen-
dency parser gives us a framework to identify
the relations between the verb(s) and the other
constituents in a sentence. Such relations, which
basically occur between verb(s) and nominal
constituents are called Karaka relations.For
Nepali, we have identified altogether six different
Karaka relations, namely,Karta - K1, Karma -
K2, Karan-K3, Sampradan - K4, Apadaan-K5,
Others-KX.
The assumption is that if we can establish valid
Karaka relations between the chunks of the sen-
tence and the verb, then the given input sentence
is valid.For example, in the Nepali sentence
Ram le bhaat khaayo (meaning Ram ate rice),
there is a K1 relation between the verb khaayo
and the noun chunk Ram le, and similarly K2
relation between the verb khaayo and the noun
chunk bhaat. Next, the Karaka frame specifies
what karakas are mandatory or optional for the
verb and what vibhaktis(postpositions) they take
respectively. Each verb belongs to a specific verb
class (in our case, whether the verb is transitive
or intransitive)and each class has a basic karaka
frame. Each Tense,Aspect and Modality - TAM
of a verb specifies a transformation rule. Based
10http://w3.msi.vxu.se/nivre/papers/05133.pdf
Figure 1: System Architecture of the Nepali Com-
putational Grammar Analyzer
on the TAM of a verb, a transformation is made
on the verb frame taking reference of the TAM
frame. A detailed description of the Nepali
Computation Grammar Analyzer is available at
http://nepalinux.org/downloads/nlp/report on
nepali computational grammar.pdf
The Grammar Analyzer for Nepali currently
parses and analyzes simple declarative sentences
with just one verb candidate.We have developed
the karaka frame for around 700 Nepali verbs.An
agreement module if added to the analyzer could
further filter the parses returned by the parser
module, this time taking the feature agreements
like gender, number, person, tense, aspect and
modality. Hence,with the possible addition of the
agreement module, the robustness of the Grammar
Analyzer is believed to significantly increase.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we discussed on the different efforts
put towards developing the basic NLP resources
and applications.We also talked about the ap-
proaches followed by the applications and shed
light on their current coverage and limitations.
From the discussions above, it is quite clear
that much work has been done in developing
a basic NLP foundation for Nepali both from
resource buiding and applications development
perspectives. The way ahead is undoubtedly in
refining the current achievements and building ad-
vanced NLP applications like Statistical Machine
Translation System, Name Entity Recognition
System, Question Answering System,Information
Retrieval System, Information Extraction System
etc. Another possibility is applying the expertise
and experiences gathered while working for
Nepali to other non-Nepali languages.
