SLANT GRAMMAR CALCULUS 
By

KVAL ,  Fack, Stockholm 40, Sweden 
Summary  
Bar-Hillel and Lambek  have outlined a syntactical description where the syn- 
tactical category symbols are written as fractions and where the analysis of 
a given sentence is performed according to rules very similar to common 
arithmetical reduction of fraction expressions with factors that cancel out. 
Are there algorithms for applying such a calculus to normally complexnatur-  
al language structures ? 
1. A im 
We seek  a fo rmal  recogn i t ion  procedure  that  w i l l  enab le  us  to dec ide  fo r  any  
g iven  sequence  of e lements  f rom a g iven  language whether  or  not  the  sequence  
is grammatical. 
We consider only one method, named that of a categorial g rammar  (Bar-Hillel 
and Lambek). 
We make the fo l low ing  assumpt ions :  
(a) The  knowledge we want  to u t i l i ze  fo r  recogn i t ion  can  w i thout  res idue  be  
summar ized  in 
a l i s t ,  g iv ing  fo r  each  word  the grammat ica l  ca tegor ies  the word  
be longs  to;  a se t  of combinat ion  ru les  fo r  the  category  symbo ls .  
(h) A sequence  of e lements  is  g rammat ica l  i f  there  ex is ts  at  leas t  one word-  
fo r -word  t rans la t ion  of i t  in to  grammat ica l  ca tegory  symbo ls  wh ich  y ie lds  
a symbo l  sequence  that  is  permi t ted  accord ing  to the  set  of combinat ion  
ru les .  We say  that  a symbo l  sequence  wh ich  agrees  w i th  the combinat ion  
ru les  is  a grammat ica l  symbo l  sequence .  
Z. Shr ink ing  Procedure  
We assume that  i t  i s  poss ib le  to ver i fy  the grammat ica l i ty  of a symbo l  sequence  
by  reduct ion  of i t  to s imp ler  and  shor ter  sequences  s tep  by  s tep .  In each  s tep  
one or  more  symbols  in  the sequences  are  rep laced  by  one new symbol .  
The s t r ing  rep laced  by  one o ther  symbo l  w i l l  - to beg in  w i th  w i thout  l ingu is t i c  
in terpretat ion  - be ca l led  a syntagrn ;  the  rep lac ing  symbol  w i l l  be ca l led  the 
name of the  syntagm.  
The work  repor ted  in th i s  paper  has  been sponsored  by Humanis t i ska  fo rsk -  
n ingsr~det ,  Tekn iska  fo rskn ingsr~det  and  R iksbankens  Jub i leumsfond,  S tock -  
ho lm,  Sweden.  
By success ive  app l i ca t ion  of rewr i t ing  ru les ,  the  or ig ina l  sequence  is  shrunk  
to a no longer  reduc ib le  res idue j  wh ichmay be jus t  one symbol .  If th i s  re -  
s idue is  conta ined  in  a g iven  l i s t  of permiss ib le  sentence  pat terns ,  the sen-  
tence  is  g rammat ica l .  
3. S lant  Grammar  Ca lcu lus  
The  k ind  of g rammar  under  s tudy  we sha l l  s imp ly  ca l l  s lant  g rammar  f rom 
i t s  sa l ient  t ra i t ,  the  notat ion .  I t  is  character i zed  by the fo l low ing  proper t ies :  
a) IThe category  symbo ls  a re  a l l  of the fo rm 
a (atomic symbols) 
% 
or x /y~ (complex symbols)  \xj 
where  x and  y in  the i r  tu rn  have  the same fo rm ~atomic  or  complex)  as the 
categor--y symbo ls .  We sha l l  ca l l  a_ and  x numerators  and  X a denominator  
in  such  cases .  
b) Combinatorics is condensed to the following 
a) a sym-bol sequence is a grammat ica l  syntagm Of type t if and only if it 
can be reducedtot  by successive application of one of-the following t~o 
cancellation rules for contracting two neighbouring symbols of the - 
original or the so far reduced - sequence into one symbol: 
x /y  y~ x 
y y\x-* x 
where  x and  Z are  a tomic  or  complex  symbo ls .  
8) a grammat ica l  sentence  is a syntagm of a type  wh ich  be longs  to a shor t  1 
-7  
l i s t  of poss ib le  types  of pat terns ,  say  type  s .  
The categorial notation seems helpful in establishing a recognition calculus. 
Some programmable  algorithms will be discussed in this paper. 
I t  i s  eas i ly  seen  that  s lant  g rammars  of the  type d iscussed  are  equ iva lent  to 
context - f ree  phrase  s t ructure  grammars  (as fa r ,  i .e . ,  as  any  generat ive  
grammar  can  be "equ iva lent"  to a recogn i t ion  grammar) .  
The  cance l la t ion  ru les  presuppose  that  i f  the symbo ls  a /b  and  b are  reduced 
to a0 there  must  not  s tand  anyth ing  between the  syntagms a /b  and  b - i .e . ,  
the~e must  be no  ho le  in the  syntagm a - a l though the symbols  a /b- -and b may 
in the or ig ina l  sequence  s tand  w ide ly  apar t .  
A s lant  g rammar  fo r  one g iven  language may be  wr i t ten  in many d i f fe rent  ways .  
Thus  one may des ign  the grammar  so that  the  category  symbo ls  hav__~e at the  most  
one ~denominator  and  even  so that  they  have  on ly  le f t  denominator  o r  on ly  r ight  
denominator (Marcus). 
A natural way  to design the grammar  would be to let governed syntagms have 
simple symbols (~ and the govern ingo- -~complex symbols  x/y, or inversely, 
so that the relation operator/operand would imply dependency relation. 
However,  the number  of alternative symbols for each word  will tend to increase 
if such a priori rules should apply to the whole set of symbols. Given the algo- 
r i thm for  recogn i t ion ,  one may ask  how the categor ia l  g rammar  shou ld  be de-  
s igned  so as to g ive the min imum number  of operat ions ,  e .g . ,  so as  to y ie ld  
on an average ,  the min imum number  of poss ib le  word- fo r -word  t rans la t ions  
into grammat ica l  symbo ls .  
4. Reduct ion  P rocedure  
To beg in  w i th ,  we sha l l  inve~stigate some procedures  fo r  ana lys i s  of a g iven  se -  
quence  of ca tegory  symbo ls .  Then ,  cf .  8 be low,  we turn  to the pract i ca l ly  more  
impor tant  p rob lem when not  a sequence  o~r -symbo ls  but  a sequence  of words  is 
g iven ,  each  word  hav ing  severa l  potent ia l  ca tegor ies .  
5. Subst i tu t ing  Complex  Symbols  
We make a pre l iminary  s imp l i f i ca t ion  of the prob lem by rep lac ing  every  com-  
p lex  denominator  in the sequence  by a new,  a rb i t ra ry  a tomic  symbo l .  S imul -  
taneous ly ,  we make cor respond ing  subst i tu t ions  of numerators :  if  we rep lace  
b /c  by  x as a denominator ,  we a l so  rep lace  b /c  by, x at some other  p lace ,  where  
b /c  appears  as a numerator .  
Example :  
b/(c/a) c/a b\a/(b/c) d d\(b/c) = b/y y a/x d d\x. 
Now,  if  b /c  shou ld  happen to appear  in numerator  pos i t ion  more  o f ten  in the 
g iven sequence  than  it does  qua denominator ,  th is  rep lacement  can be per -  
fo rmed in more  than one way.  We then  do per fo rm it  in more  than one way~ 
thus  generat ing  a number  of a l te rnat ive  symbo l  s t r ings  to be processed .  Through 
th is  a r t i f i ce ,  we have sequences  where  a l l  denominators  a re  cer ta in  to be a toms,  
a fac t  wh ich  rad ica l ly  s imp l i f ies  the ana lys i s .  Ins tead  we have made the symbo l  
qe lec t ion  procedure  more  d i f f i cu l t .  
S ince  now al l  denominators  a re  a toms and s ince  {b \a ) /c  is  equ iva lent  o b / (a /c )  
and to b~a/c ,  the brackets  a re  now redundant  and can be omi t ted .  
The symbo ls ,  then  cons is t  of  a kerne l  a tom,  poss ib ly  ne ighboured  at one s ide  
or  both  by a slant__ and another  a tom,  in i ts  tu rn  poss ib ly  ne ighboured  by s lant  
p lus  a tom,  and so on, a11 s lants  to the le f t  of the kerne l  be ing  t i l ted  to the  le f t  
and those  to the r ight  t i l ted  in the oppos i te  d i rec t ion :  
r - -  
a,  a/c, b\a lc ,  g \ f \e \d \a lb lc  I . . . .  
If one knows  wh ich  e lement  is  the kerne l .one  does  not  even  need the s lants  and 
we can proceed to s imp l i fy  one s tep  fu r ther :  
a, ac,  bac ,  gfeda_bc . . . .  
where  the under l ined  characters  a re  numerator  a toms and a l l  o thers  a re  de -  
nominator  a toms.  
(If the language has  no ru les  fo r  the re la t ive  o rder  of syntagms,  g rammat ica -  
l i ty  i s  rap id ly  teste_~l~Just  check  that  to each  denominator  a tom cor responds  
one numerator  a tom of the same name,  leav ing  w i thout  a match  jus t  one numer -  
a t0r ,  wh ich  then  denotes  the type of the syntagm.  In th is  case  we are  permi t ted  
to t reat  the a toms as numerators  and denominators  in the ar i thmet ica l  sense .  
If we ass ign  pr ime numbers  to each  a tom and reduce  in the s tandard  ar i thme-  
t i ca l  way ,  we end  up w i th  the numer ica l  va lue  of the type of the syn~agm.  Th is  
s imp le  tes t  may be wor th  cons ider ing  as  a f i r s t  check ,  even  though the s t rUc -  
tu re  of the language be fa r  more  complex . )  
6. Wanted:  Non- In tersect ing  Vau l ts  
The  two above-ment ioned  cance l la t ion  ru les  a re ,  rewr i t ten  in  the  mod i f ied  
( s imp ler )  nota t ion ,  fused  in to  one :  
If  in  a s t r ing  of  characters ,  an  under l ined  character  and  a non-  
under l ined  character  appear ,  separated  on ly  by  a space  character  
and  denot ing  the  same atom,  e rase  a l l  th ree  characters .  
Our  task  may a l so  be  fo rmula ted  thus :  
Draw a connect ing  l ine  f rom each  denominator  in  the  s t r ing  to  a 
numerator  w i th  the  same name,  in  the  cor rec t  d i rec t ion  - i . e . ,  
not  over  the  numerator  of  the  own symbo l  - l i ke  vau l t s  over  the  
s t r ings ,  in  such  a way  that  no  two  such  vau l t s  in tersect  and  that  
one  numerator  - say  \[ - remains  untouched by  any  vau l t  nor  roo fed  
by  one .  I f  th i s  succeeds ,  the  s t r ing  i s  a g rammat ica l  sequence  o f  
type  t .

7. Ident i f i ca t ion  o f  the  Cor rec t  Numerator  
If  a l l  numerator  symbo ls  a re  d i f fe rent  the  task  i s  t r i v ia l .  I f  severa l  numera-  
to r  a toms car ry  the  same name,  we  have  to dec ide  wh ich  one  i s  in tended by  
a g iven  denominator .  How do we do th i s  ? 
The  prob lem i s  in  th i s  fo rm a pure ly  computat iona l  one  - and no  easy  such  
prob lem.  
8. A lgor i thm wi th  S tack ing  
One a lgor i thm can  be  summar ized  as  fo l lows :  
We have  a g iven  s t r ing  o f  words  and  want  to ascer ta in  whether  i t s  type  i s  one  
of  the  set  T = I s ,  t . . . .  \ ] .  For  each  word  we have  a g iven  set  of  a l te rnat ive  
category  symbo ls .  
We f i r s t  cons ider  the  s imp ler  p rob lem of  ana lyz ing  a g iven  s t r ing  o f  ca tegory  
symbo ls  and  see  i f  i t  can  be  reduced  to s .  
We jo in  the  (not  under l ined  symbo l )  s fo l lowed by  space  to the  beg inn ing  o f  the  
g iven  symbo l  s t r ing .  When the  reduct ion  ru les  a re  app l ied  the  resu l tant  s t r ing  
shou ld  van ish ;  we  say  i t  i s  reduced  to un i ty .  
The  s t r ing  now conta ins  exact ly  as  many ,  say  n ,  numerator  and  denominator  
a toms.  Every  numerator  shou ld  be  pa i red  w i th  one  o ther  denominator ;  the  
who le  probhefn  i s  to dec ide  wh ich  denominator .  
Whenever  we  thus  pa i r  two  a toms,  the  in terven ing  s t r ing  o f  a toms shou ld  va -  
n i sh  under  reduct ion ,  be  reduc ib le  to  un i ty .  The  same ho lds  fo r  the  res t  of  the  
o r ig ina l  s t r ing ,  a f te r  the  two  pa i red  a toms and  everyth ing  between them has  
been  removed:

s a_ ab_c'd'- d e ~-c_fg g i 
In  genera l ,  then ,  when one  wants  to tes t  whether  a pa i r ing  i s  a good  match  
or  not ,  one  i s  le f t  w i th  two  s imp ler ,  i somorph ic  p rob lems,  those  of  reduc ing  
two  s t r ings  to un i ty :  
s a ab fg  g f_; d d e e 
Normal ly  we  cannot  dec ide  be forehand wh ich  pa i r ing  to tes t ;  we  must  t ry  a l te r -  
nat ives .  For  each  arb i t ra ry  cho ice  of  p rocedure ,  we s tore  the  a l te rnat ives  in  
an  OR-s tack ,  For  each  pa i r ing  we p lace  the  bracketed-out  s t r ing  in  an  AND-  
s tack ,  to be  hand led  la ter  when and  i f  the  s t r ing  on  our  work ing  tab le  van ishes .  
I f  we  have  empt ied  the  tab le  and  the  AND-s tack ,  the  g iven  s t r ing  was  reduc ib le  
to s .  I f  we  have  an  i r reduc ib le  res idue  on  the  tab le ,  we c lear  the  tab le  and  t ry  
the  next  a l te rnat ive  i f  there  i s  one  in  the  OR-s tack ,  de le t ing  what  has  been  
s tored  in  the  AND-s tack  s ince  the  las t  a rb i t ra ry  cho ice ;  i f  we  cannot  reduce  
to un i ty  the  s t r ing  on  the  tab le  and  the  OR-s tack  i s  empty ,  we must  g ive  the  
task  up .  
To  min imize  the  number  of  pa i r ings  to tes t  fo r  each  s t r ing  we ana lyze ,  we  
draw up  a b inary  mat r ix  M of  potent ia l  matches ,  w i th  m. .  = 1, i f  the  denomi -  
nator  No .  i and  the  numerator  No .  j a re  the  same character  and  are  p laced  
in  p roper  o rder  and  reasonab ly  w ide  apar t  in  the  s t r ing .  (E .g . ,  i f  i i s  a 
"non- recurs ive"  type  o f  syntagm,  " reasonab ly"  p laced  means  that , - i s  the  
neares t  numerator  wr i t ten  w i th  the  same character  as  i and  p laced  on the  
proper  s ide  o f  i . )  
I f  any  row or  co lumn in  M i s  empty ,  the  task  i s  hope less .  Otherw ise ,  we  se -  
lec t  the  a tom whose  row or  co lumn conta ins  the  leas t  number  of  1 ~s .  
To analyze a string of words  we assign to each word  one symbol  of the type 
ABCDE,  where C is the set of numerators  in all the word  ts category sym-  
bols, B is the set of nominator atoms appearing immediately before the 
numerator  in any one of the word's  category symbols, etc. On  the string of 
these new symbols the above procedure, mutatis mutandis, is applied. Thus, 
instead of the condition in (I) above that two atoms should be the "same"  
characters, it is required that one underlined atom A and a non-underlined 
atom B appearing separated only by space should fulfill the condition A n B ~ 0.
