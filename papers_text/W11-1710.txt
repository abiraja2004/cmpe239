Abstract 
This paper reports the development of Jap-
anese WordNet Affect from the English 
WordNet Affect lists with the help of Eng-
lish SentiWordNet and Japanese WordNet. 
Expanding the available synsets of the 
English WordNet Affect using SentiWord-
Net, we have performed the translation of 
the expanded lists into Japanese based on 
the synsetIDs in the Japanese WordNet. A 
baseline system for emotion analysis of 
Japanese sentences has been developed 
based on the Japanese WordNet Affect. The 
incorporation of morphology improves the 
performance of the system. Overall, the 
system achieves average precision, recall 
and F-scores of 32.76%, 53% and 40.49% 
respectively on 89 sentences of the Japa-
nese judgment corpus and 83.52%, 49.58% 
and 62.22% on 1000 translated Japanese 
sentences of the SemEval 2007 affect sens-
ing test corpus. Different experimental out-
comes and morphological analysis suggest 
that irrespective of the google translation 
error, the performance of the system could 
be improved by enhancing the Japanese 
WordNet Affect in terms of coverage.  
1 Introduction 
Emotion analysis, a recent sub discipline at the 
crossroads of information retrieval (Sood et al, 
2009) and computational linguistics (Wiebe et al, 
2006) is becoming increasingly important from 
application view points of affective computing.  
The majority of subjective analysis methods that 
are related to emotion is based on textual keywords 
spotting that use specific lexical resources. Senti-
WordNet (Baccianella et al, 2010) is a lexical re-
source that assigns positive, negative and objective 
scores to each WordNet synset (Miller, 1995). Sub-
jectivity wordlist (Banea et al, 2008) assigns 
words with the strong or weak subjectivity and 
prior polarities of types positive, negative and neu-
tral.  Affective lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti, 
2004), one of the most efficient resources of emo-
tion analysis, contains emotion words. To the best 
of our knowledge, these lexical resources have 
been created for English. A recent study shows that 
non-native English speakers support the growing 
use of the Internet1. Hence, there is a demand for 
automatic text analysis tools and linguistic re-
sources for languages other than English.  
In the present task, we have prepared the Japa-
nese WordNet Affect from the already available 
English WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 
2004). Entries in the English WordNet Affect are 
annotated using Ekman?s (1993) six emotional 
categories (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, sur-
prise). The collection of the English WordNet Af-
fect 2 synsets that are used in the present work was 
provided as a resource in the ?Affective Text? 
shared task of SemEval-2007 Workshop.  
The six WordNet Affect lists that were provided 
in the shared task contain only 612 synsets in total 
with 1536 words. The words in each of the six 
emotion lists have been observed to be not more 
than 37.2% of the words present in the correspond-
ing SentiWordNet synsets. Hence, these six lists 
are expanded with the synsets retrieved from the

English SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al, 2010). 
We assumed that the new sentiment bearing words 
in English SentiWordNet might have some emo-
tional connotation in Japanese even keeping their 
part-of-speech (POS) information unchanged. The 
numbers of entries in the expanded word lists are 
increased by 69.77% and 74.60% at synset and 
word levels respectively. We have mapped the 
synsetID of the WordNet Affect lists with the syn-
setID of the WordNet 3.03. This mapping helps in 
expanding the WordNet Affect lists with the recent 
version of SentiWordNet 3.0 4 as well as translating 
with the Japanese WordNet (Bond et al, 2009). 
Some affect synsets (e.g., 00115193-a huffy, mad, 
sore) are not translated into Japanese as there are 
no equivalent synset in the Japanese WordNet.  
Primarily, we have developed a baseline system 
based on the Japanese WordNet Affect and carried 
out the evaluation on a Japanese judgement corpus 
of 89 sentences. The system achieves the average 
F-score of 36.39% with respect to six emotion 
classes. We have also incorporated an open source 
Japanese morphological analyser 5 . The perform-
ance of the system has been increased by 4.1% in 
average F-score with respect to six emotion classes. 
Scarcity of emotion corpus in Japanese moti-
vated us to apply an open source google translator6 
to build the Japanese emotion corpus from the 
available English SemEval-2007 affect sensing 
corpus. The baseline system based on the Japanese 
WordNet Affect achieves average precision, recall 
and F-score of 83.52%, 49.58% and 62.22% re-
spectively on 1000 translated test sentences. The 
inclusion of morphological processing improves 
the performance of the system. Different experi-
ments have been carried out by selecting different 
ranges of annotated emotion scores. Error analysis 
suggests that though the system performs satisfac-
torily in identifying the sentential emotions based 
on the available words of the Japanese WordNet 
Affect, the system suffers from the translated ver-
sion of the corpus. In addition to that, the Japanese 
WordNet Affect also needs an improvement in 
terms of coverage.  
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Different developmental phases of the Japanese 
WordNet Affect are described in Section 3. Prepa-

ration of the translated Japanese corpus, different 
experiments and evaluations based on morphology 
and the annotated emotion scores are elaborated in 
Section 4. Finally Section 5 concludes the paper. 
2 Related Works  
The extraction and annotation of subjective terms 
started with machine learning approaches (Hat-
zivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997). Some well 
known sentiment lexicons have been developed, 
such as subjective adjective list (Baroni and Veg-
naduzzo, 2004), English SentiWordNet (Esuli et. 
al., 2006), Taboada?s adjective list (Voll and 
Taboada, 2007), SubjectivityWord List (Banea et 
al., 2008) etc. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) 
present a method for extracting positive or negative 
sentiment bearing adjectives from WordNet using 
the Sentiment Tag Extraction Program (STEP). 
The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2006) 
automatically generate resources for subjectivity 
analysis for a new target language from the avail-
able resources for English. On the other hand, an 
automatically generated and scored sentiment lexi-
con, SentiFul (Neviarouskaya et al, 2009), its 
expansion, morphological modifications and dis-
tinguishing sentiment features also shows the con-
tributory results.   
But, all of the above mentioned resources are in 
English and have been used in coarse grained sen-
timent analysis (e.g., positive, negative or neutral). 
The proposed method in (Takamura et al, 2005) 
extracts semantic orientations from a small number 
of seed words with high accuracy in the experi-
ments on English as well as Japanese lexicons. 
But, it was also aimed for sentiment bearing words. 
Instead of English WordNet Affect (Strapparava 
and Valitutti, 2004), there are a few attempts in 
other languages such as, Russian and Romanian 
(Bobicev et al, 2010), Bengali (Das and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2010) etc. Our present approach is similar 
to some of these approaches but in contrast, we 
have evaluated our Japanese WordNet Affect on the 
SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus translated into 
Japanese. In recent trends, the application of me-
chanical turk for generating emotion lexicon (Mo-
hammad and Turney, 2010) shows promising 
results. In the present task, we have incorporated 
the open source, available and accessible resources 
to achieve our goals.

3 Developmental Phases  
3.1 WordNet Affect 
The English WordNet Affect, based on Ekman?s six 
emotion types is a small lexical resource compared 
to the complete WordNet but its affective annota-
tion helps in emotion analysis. Some collection of 
WordNet Affect synsets was provided as a resource 
for the shared task of Affective Text in SemEval-
2007. The whole data is provided in six files 
named by the six emotions. Each file contains a list 
of synsets and one synset per line. An example 
synset entry from WordNet Affect is as follows. 
a#00117872 angered  enraged  furious  infuri-
ated  maddened 
The first letter of each line indicates the part of 
speech (POS) and is followed by the affectID. The 
representation was simple and easy for further 
processing. We have retrieved and linked the com-
patible synsetID from the recent version of Word-
Net 3.0 with the affectID of the WordNet Affect 
synsets. We have searched each WordNet Affect 
synset in WordNet 3.0. If a matching WordNet 3.0 
synset is found, the WordNet 3.0 synsetID is 
mapped to the WordNet Affect affectID.  The link-
ing between two synsets of WordNet Affect and 
WordNet 3.0 is shown in Figure 1.

Net Affect and WordNet 
3.2 Expansion of WordNet Affect using Sen-
tiWordNet 
It has been observed that the WordNet Affect con-
tains fewer number of emotion word entries. The 
six lists provided in the SemEval 2007 shared task 
contain only 612 synsets in total with 1536 words. 
The detail distribution of the emotion words as 
well as the synsets in the six different lists accord-
ing to their POS is shown in Table 1. Hence, we 
have expanded the lists with adequate number of 
emotion words using SentiWordNet before at-
tempting any translation of the lists into Japanese. 
SentiWordNet assigns each synset of WordNet with 
two coarse grained subjective scores such as posi-
tive and negative along with an objective score. 
SentiWordNet contains more number of coarse 
grained emotional words than WordNet Affect. We 
assumed that the translation of the coarse grained 
emotional words into Japanese might contain more 
or less fine-grained emotion words. One example 
entry of the SentiWordNet is shown below. The 
POS of the entry is followed by a synset ID, posi-
tive and negative scores and synsets containing 
sentiment words.   
SentiWordNet:  
a 121184  0.25 0.25 infuri-
ated#a#1 furious#a#2 maddened#a#1 en-
raged#a#1 angered#a#1 
Our aim is to increase the number of emotion 
words in the WordNet Affect using SentiWordNet, 
both of which are developed from the WordNet. 
Hence, each word of the WordNet Affect is re-
placed by the equivalent synsets retrieved from 
SentiWordNet if the synset contains that emotion 
word. The POS information in the WordNet Affect 
is kept unchanged during expansion. A related ex-
ample is shown in Figure 2. The distributions of 
expanded synsets and words for each of the six 
emotion classes based on four different POS types 
(noun N, verb V, adjective Adj. and adverb Adv.) 
are shown in Table 1. But, we have kept the dupli-
cate entries at synset level for identifying the emo-
tion related scores in our future attempts by 
utilizing the already associated positive and nega-
tive scores of SentiWordNet. The percentage of 
entries in the updated word lists are increased by 
69.77 and 74.60 at synset and word levels.  
3.3 Translation of Expanded WordNet Affect 
into Japanese  
We have mapped the affectID of the WordNet Af-
fect to the corresponding synsetID of the WordNet 
3.0. This mapping helps to expand the WordNet 
Affect with the recent version of SentiWordNet 3.0 
as well as translating the expanded lists into Japa-
nese using the Japanese WordNet (Bond et al, 
2009).

WordNet, the synsets of the expanded lists are au-
tomatically translated into Japanese equivalent

3.4 Analyzing Translation Errors  
Some SentiWordNet synsets (e.g., 00115193-a huf-
fy, mad, sore) are not translated into Japanese as 
there are no equivalent synset entries in the Japa-
nese WordNet. There were a large number of word 
combinations, collocations and idioms in the Japa-
nese WordNet Affect. These parts of synsets show 
problems during translation and therefore manual 
83
translation is carried out for these types. Some of 
the English synsets (?07517292-n lividity?) were 
not translated into Japanese. But, an equivalent 
gloss of the word ?lividity? that is present in the 
Japanese WordNet is ?a state of fury so great the 
face becomes discolored?. One of the reasons of 
such translation problems may be that no equiva-
lent Japanese word sense is available for such Eng-
lish words. 
4 Evaluation and Analysis 
We have evaluated the lexical coverage of the de-
veloped Japanese WordNet Affect on a small emo-
tional judgment corpus and SemEval 2007 affect 
sensing corpus.  
4.1 Evaluation on Judgment Corpus    
The judgment corpus that is being developed by 
the Japan System Applications Co. Ltd. 8 contains 
only 100 sentences of emotional judgments. But, 
this corpus is not an open source till date. We have 
evaluated our Japanese WordNet Affect based base-
line system on these 100 sentences and the results 
for each of the six emotion classes are shown in 
Table 4. We have also incorporated an open source 
morphological analyzer9 in our baseline system.   
The algorithm is that, if a word in a sentence is 
present in any of the Japanese WordNet Affect lists; 
the sentence is tagged with the emotion label cor-
responding to that affect list. But, if any word is 
not found in any of the six lists, each word of the 
sentence is passed through the morphological 
process to identify its root form which is searched 
through the Japanese WordNet Affect lists again. If 
the root form is found in any of the six Japanese 
WordNet Affect lists, the sentence is tagged accor-
dingly. Otherwise, the sentence is tagged as non-
emotional or neutral. The average F-Score of the 
baseline system has been improved by 4.1% with 
respect to the six emotion classes. Due to the fewer 
number of sentential instances in some emotion 
classes (e.g., joy, sadness, surprise), the perfor-
mance of the system gives poor results even after 
including the morphological knowledge. One of 
the reasons may be the less number of words and 
synset entries in some WordNet Affect lists (e.g., 
fear). Hence, we have aimed to translate the Eng-

4.2 Evaluation on Translated SemEval 2007 
Affect Sensing Corpus    
The English SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus 
consists of news headlines only. Each of the news 
headlines is tagged with a valence score and scores 
for all the six Ekman?s emotions. The six emotion 
scores for each sentence are in the range of 0 to 
100. We have considered that each sentence is as-
signed a single sentential emotion tag based on the 
maximum emotion score out of six annotated emo-
tion scores. We have used the Google translator 
API 10to translate the 250 and 1000 sentences of 
the trial and test sets of the SemEval 2007 corpus 
respectively. The experiments regarding morphol-
ogy and emotion scores are conducted on the trial 
corpus. We have carried out different experiments 
on 1000 test sentences by selecting different ranges 
of emotion scores. The corresponding experimental 
results are also shown in Table 5. Incorporation of 
morphology improves the performance of the sys-
tem. On the other hand, it is observed that the per-
formance of the system decreases by increasing the 
range of Emotion Scores (ES). The reason may be 
that the numeric distribution of the sentential in-
stances in each of the emotion classes decreases as 
the range in emotion scores increases.

4.3 Analysis of Morphology  
Japanese affect lists include words as well as 
phrases. We deal with phrases using Japanese 
morphology tool to find affect words in a sentence 
and substitute an affect word into its original con-
jugated form. One of the main reasons of using a 
morphology tool is to analyze the conjugated form 
and to identify the phrases. For example, the Japa-
nese word for the equivalent English word ?anger? 
is "?? (o ko ru)" but there are other conjugated 
word forms such as "???(o ko tta)" that means 
?angered? and it is used in past tense. Similarly, 
other conjugated form "????? (o ko tte i ta)" 
denotes the past participle form ?have angered? of 
the original word ?anger?. The morphological form 
of its passive sense is "???? (o ko ra re ru)" 
that means ?be angered?. We identify the word 
forms from their corresponding phrases by using 
the morpheme information. For example, the 
phrase "???? (o ko ra re ru)" consists of two 
words, one is ??? (o ko ra) that is in an imper-
fective form and other word is "?? (re ru) which 
is in an original form. The original form of the im-
perfective word ?? (o ko ra) is "?? (o ko 
ru)". It has been found that some of the English 
multi-word phrases have no equivalent Japanese 
phrase available. Only the equivalent Japanese 
words are found in Japanese WordNet. For exam 
 
ple, the following synset contains a multi-word 
phrase ?see-red?. Instead of any equivalent phrases, 
only words are found in Japanese WordNet.

5 Conclusion 
The present paper describes the preparation of Jap-
anese WordNet Affect containing six types of emo-
tion words in six separate lists. The automatic 
approach of expanding, translating and sense dis-
ambiguation tasks reduces the manual effort. The 
resource is still being updated with more number 
of emotional words to increase the coverage. The 
sense disambiguation task needs to be improved 
further in future by incorporating more number of 
translators and considering their agreement into 
account. In future we will adopt a corpus-driven 
approach for updating the resource with more 
number of emotion words and phrases for extend-
ing the emotion analysis task in Japanese.
