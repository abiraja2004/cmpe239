Abstract 
There are a number of coUocational constraints in natural anguages that ought to play a more important 
role in natural anguage parsers. Thus, for example, it is hard for most parsers to take advantage of the 
fact that wine is typically drunk, produced, and sold, but (probably) not pruned. So too, it is hard for a 
parser to know which verbs go with which prepositions (e.g., set up) and which nouns fit together to 
form compound noun phrases (e.g., computer programmer). This paper will attempt to show that many 
of these types of concerns can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not 
require explicit semantic interpretation. We have found that it is possible to identify many of these 
interesting co-occurrence r lations by computing simple summary statistics over millions of words of 
text. This paper will summarize a number of experiments carried out by various subsets of the authors 
over the last few years. The term collocation will be used quite broadly to include constraints on SVO 
(subject verb object) triples, phrasal verbs, compound noun phrases, and psycholinguistic notions of 
word association (e.g., doctor~nurse). 
1. Mutual Information 
Church and Hanks (1989) discussed the use of the mutual information statistic in order to identify a 
variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type 
(content word/content word) to lexico-syntacfic co-occurrence onstraints between verbs and prepositions 
(content word/function word). Mutual information, l(x;y), compares the probability of observing word x 
and word y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently 
(chance). 
l(x;y) -= log 2 P(x,y) 
e(x) e(y) 
If there is a genuine association between x and y, then the joint probability P(x,y) will he much larger 
than chance P(x) P(y), and consequently l(x;y) >> 0, as illustrated in the table below. If there is no 
interesting relationship between x and y, then P(x,y) = P(x) P(y), and thus, I(x;y) = 0. If x and y 
are in complementary distribution, then P(x,y) will be much less than P(x) P(y), forcing l(x;y) << 0. 
Word probabilities, P(x) and P(y), are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a 
corpus, f(x) and f(y), and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus. Joint probabilities, P(x,y), are 
estimated by counting the number of times that x is followed by y in a window of w words, fw(x,y), 
and normalizing by N (w - 1). 2 
1. The paper was previously presented at International Workshop on Parsing Technologies, CMU, 1989. 
2. The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales. Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms), 
noun phrases, and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic oncepts and other 
relationships that hold over larger scales.

Church and Hanks (1989) also used the mutual information statistic in order to identify phrasal verbs, 
following up a remark by Sinclair: 
"How common are the phrasal verbs with set? Set is particularly rich in making combinations 
with words like about, in, up, out, on, off, and these words are themselves very common. How 
likely is set off to occur? Both are frequent words; \[set occurs approximately 250 times in a 
million words and\] off occurs approximately 556 dmes in a million words... \[T\]he question we 
are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur immediately after set? 
... This is 0.00025x0.00055 \[P(x) P(y)\], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 ... 
The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text \[at 
chance, in our terminology\]. It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure 
of how much set and off attract each other is to compare the probability with what actually 
happens... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus 
\[P(x,y)=70/(7.3 106) >> P(X) P(y)\]. That is enough to show its main patterning and it 
suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the description 
of a substantial collection of phrases... (Sinclair 1987b, pp. 151-152) 
It happens that set ... off was found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million 
words, about the same number of occurrences per million as Sinclair found in his (mainly British) 
corpus. Quantitatively, I (set ;of f )  = 3.7, indicating that the probability of set ... off is 23.7 = 13 times 
greater than chance. This association is relatively strong; the other particles that Sinclair mentions have 
scores of: about (-0.9), in (0.6), up (4.6), out (2.2), on (1.0) in the 1987 AP Corpus of 15 million words. 
3. Preprocessing the Corpus with a Part of Speech Tagger 
Phrasal verbs involving the preposition to raise an interesting problem because of the possible confusion 
with the infinitive marker to. We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of 
speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between 
tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following 
preposition to~in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to~to. (Part of speech notation 
is borrowed from Francis and Kucera (1982); m = preposition; to = infinitive marker; vb = bare verb; 
vbg = verb + ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb + en.) The score identifies quite a 
number of verbs associated in an interesting way with to; restricting our attention to pairs with a score 
of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated with the preposition to~in and 551 verbs with the infinitive 
marker to~to. The ten verbs found to be most associated before to~in are: 
76 
? to~in: alluding/vbg, adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, relating/vbg, amounting/vbg, revert/vb, re- 
verted/vbn, resorting/vbg, relegated/vbn 
? to/to: obligated/vbn, trying/vbg, compelled/vbn, enables/vbz, supposed/vbn, intends/vbz, vow- 
ing/vbg, tried\]vbd, enabling/vbg, tends/vbz, tend\]vb, intend\]vb, tries/vbz 
Thus, we see there is considerable verage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating 
the inventory of tokens. 
4. Preprocessing with a Syntactic Parser 
Hindle has found it useful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983) in order to ask 
about the typical arguments of verbs. Thus, for any of verb in the sample, we can ask what nouns it 
takes as subjects and objects. The following table shows the objects of the verb drink that appeared at 
least two times in a sample of six million words of AP text, in effect giving the answer to the question 
"what can you drink?" Calculating the co-occurrence weight for drink, shown in the third column, 
gives us a reasonable ranking of terms, with it near the bottom. This list of drinkable things is 
intuitively quite good. 
Object Frequency Mutual Information 
<quantity> beer 2 12.34 
tea 4 11.75 
Pepsi 2 11.75 
champagne 4 11.75 
liquid 2 10.53 
beer 5 10.20 
wine 2 9.34 
water 7 7.65 
anything 3 5.15 
much 3 2.54 
it 3 1.25 
<quantity> 2 1.22 
A standard alternative approach to the classification of entities is in terms of a hierarchy of types. The 
biological taxonomy is the canonical example: a penguin is a bird is a vertebrate and so on. Such "is- 
a" hierarchies have found a prominent place in natural language processing and knowledge 
representation because they allow generalized representation f semantic features and of rules. There is 
a wide range of problems and issues in using "is-a" hierarchies in natural anguage processing, but two 
especially recommend that we investigate alternative classification schemes like the one reported here. 
First, "is-a" hierarchies are large and complicated and expensive to acquire by hand. Attempts to 
automatically derive these hierarchies for words from existing dictionaries have been only partially 
successful (Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985). Yet without a comprehensive hierarchy, it is difficult 
to use such classifications in the processing of unrestricted text. Secondly, for many purposes, even 
knowing the subclass-superclass relations is insufficient; it is difficult to predict which properties are 
inherited from a superclass and which aren't, and what properties are relevant in a particular linguistic 
usage. So for example, as noted above, despite the fact that both potatoes and peanuts are edible foods 
that grow underground, we typically bake potatoes, but roast peanuts. A distribution-based 
classification, if successful, promises to do better at least on these two problems. 
5. Significance Levels 
If the frequency counts are very small, the mutual information statistic becomes unstable. This is the 
reason for not reporting objects that appeared only once with the verb drink. Although these objects 
have very large mutual information scores, there is also a very large chance that they resulted from some 
quirk in the corpus, or a bug in the parser. For some purposes, it is desirable to measure confidence 
rather than likelihood. Gale and Church have investigated the use of a t-score instead of the mutual 
intbrmation score, as a way of identifying "significant" bigrams. 
77 
The following table shows a few significant bigrams ending with potatoes, computed from 44 million 
words of AP news wire from 2/12/88 until 12/31/88. The numbers in the first column indicate the 
confidence in standard deviations that the word sequence is interesting, and cannot be attributed to 
chance. 
t x y 
4.6 sweet potatoes 
4.3 mashed potatoes 
4.3 , potatoes 
4.0 and potatoes 
3.8 couch potatoes 
3.3 of potatoes 
3.3 frozen potatoes 
2.8 fresh potatoes 
2.8 small potatoes 
2.1 baked potatoes 
These numbers were computed by the following formula 
E(er(x y)) - E(Pr(x) er(y)) t=  
qeZ(er(x y)) + ~2(Pr(x) Pr(y)) 
where E(Pr(x y)) and t~Z(Pr(x y)) are the mean and variance of the probability of seeing word x 
followed by word y. The means and variances are computed by the Good-Turing method (Good 1953). 
Let r be the number of times that the bigram x y was found in a corpus of N words, and let N r be the 
frequencies of frequences (the number of bigrams with count r). Then r*, the estimated expected value 
Nr+l 
of r  in similar corpus of the same size, is r* = NxE(Pr(x y)) = ( r+ l )  ~ and the variance o f r  
i s~2(r )  = N2a2(Pr(x y)) = r* (1 + ( r+ l ) *  - r*) 
6. Just a Powerfid Tool 
Although it is clear that the statistics discussed above can be extremely powerful aids to a lexicographer, 
they should not be overrated. We do not aim to replace lexicographers with self-organizing statistics; 
we merely hope to provide a set of tools that could greatly improve their productivity. Suppose, for 
example, that a lexicographer wanted to find a set of words that take sentential complements. Then it 
might be helpful to start with a table of t-scores uch as: 
t x y 
74.0 said that 
50.9 noted that 
43.3 fact that 
41.9 believe that 
40.7 found that 
40.1 is that 
40.0 reported that 
39.5 adding that 
38.6 Tuesday that 
38.4 Wednesday that 
It might be much quicker for a lexicographer to edit down this list than to construct he list from 
intuition alone. It doesn't take very much time to decide that Tuesday and Wednesday are less 
interesting than the others. Of course, it might be possible to automate some of these decisions by 
appropriately preprocessing the corpus with a part of speech tagger or a parser, but it will probably 
always be necessary to exercise some editorial judgment. 
78 
7. Practical Applications 
The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important appficadons, including: 
? enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage, 
? enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compifing lexicons of lexico-syntactic 
facts, 
? providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous yntactic structures uch as noun 
compounds, conjunctions, and prepositional phrases, 
? retrieving texts from large databases (e.g., newspapers, patents), and 
? constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition 
(OCR). 
Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR) application. Suppose that we have an OCR device such 
as (Kahan, Pavfidis, Baird 1987), and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized 
"farm" and "form," where the context is either: (1) "federal credit" or (2) "some of." We 
doubt that the reader has any trouble specifying which alternative is more likely. By using the following 
probabilities for the eight bigrams in this sequence, a computer program can rely on an estimated 
likelihood to make the same distinction. 
x y Observations per million words 
federal farm 0.50 
federal form 0.039 
farm credit 0.13 
form credit 0.026 
some form 4.1 
some farm 0.63 
form of 34.0 
farm of 0.81 
The probability of the tri-grams can be approximated by multiplying the probabilities of the the two 
constituent bigrams. Thus, the probability of federal farm credit can be approximated as 
(0.5x10-6)x(0.13x 10 -6) = 0.065? 10 -12. Similarly, the probability for federal form credit can be 
approximiated as (0.039x10-6)x(0.026x10 -6) = 0.0010?10 -12. The ratio of these likelihoods 
shows that "farm" is (0.065x10-12)/(0.0010x10-12) = 65 times more likely than "form" in this 
context. In the other context, "some of," it turns out that " form" is 273 times more likely than 
"farm." This example shows how likelihood ratios can be used in an optical character recognition 
system to disambiguate among optically confusable words. Note that alternative disambiguation 
methods based on syntactic onstraints such as part of speech are unlikely to help in this case since both 
" form" and "farm" are commonly used as nouns. 
8. Alternatives to Collocation for Recognition Applications 
There have been quite a number of attempts to use syntactic methods in speech recognition, beginning 
with the A.RPA speech project and continuing on to the present. It might be noted, however, that there 
has not been very much success, perhaps because syntax alone is not a strong enough constraint on 
language use (performance). We believe that collocational constraints should play an important role in 
recognition applications, and attempts to ignore coUocafional constraints and use purely syntactic 
methods will probably run into difficulties. 
Syntactic onstraints, by themselves, though are probably not very important. Any psycholinguist knows 
that the influence of syntax on lexical retrieval is so subtle that you have to control very carefully for all 
the factors that really matter (e.g., word frequency, word association orms, etc.). On the other hand, 
collocational factors (word associations) dominate syntactic ones so much that you can easily measure 
79 
the influence of word frequency and word association orms on lexical retrieval without careful controls 
for syntax. 
There are many ways to demonstrate he relative lack of constraint imposed by syntax. Recall the old 
television game show, "The Match Game," where a team of players was given a sentence with a 
missing word, e.g, "Byzantine icons couM murder the divine BLANK," and asked to fill in the blank 
the same way that the studio audience did. The game was 'interesting' because there are enough 
constraints in natural language so that there is a reasonably large probability of a match. Suppose, 
however, that we make our speech recognition device play the match game with a handicap; instead of 
giving the speech recognition device the word string, "Byzantine icons couM murder the divine 
BLANK," we give the speech recognition device just the syntactic parse tree, \[S \[NP nn nns\] \[VP 
\[AUX md\ ]  v \[NP at jj BLANK \]\]\], and ask it to guess the missing word. This is effectively what we 
are doing by limiting the language model to syntactic considerations alone. Of course, with this the 
handicap, the match game isn't much of a game; the recognition device doesn't have a fair chance to 
guess the missing word. 
We believe that syntax will ultimately be a very important source of constraint, but in a more indirect 
way. As we have been suggesting, the real constraints will come from word frequencies and 
collocational constraints, but these questions will probably need to be broken out by syntactic ontext. 
How likely is it for this noun to conjoin with that noun? Is this noun a typical subject of that verb? 
And so on. In this way, syntax plays a crucial role in providing the relevant representation for 
expressing these very important constraints, but crucially, it does not provide very much useful 
constraint (in the information theoretic sense) all by itself. 3 
9. Conclusion 
In any natural language there are restrictions on what words can appear together in the same 
construction, and in particular, on what can be arguments of what predicates. It is common practice in 
linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their co- 
occurrence with other words. Running through the whole Fiahian tradition, for example, is the theme 
that "You shall know a word by the company it keeps" (Firth, 1957). 
"On the one hand, bank co-occurs with words and expressions uch as money, notes, loan, 
account, investment, clerk, official, manager, robbery, vaults, working in a, its actions, First 
National, of England, and so forth. On the other hand, we find bank co-occurring with river, 
swim, boat, east (and of course West and South, which have acquired special meanings of their 
own), on top of the, and of the Rhine." (Hanks 1987, p. 127) 
Harris (1968) makes this "distributional hypothesis" central to his linguistic theory. His claim is that: 
"the meaning of entities, and the meaning of grammatical relations among them, is related to the 
restriction of combinations of these entities relative to other entities," (Harris 1968:12). Granting that 
there must be some relationship between distribution and meaning, the exact nature of such a 
relationship to our received notions of meaning is nevertheless not without its complications. For 
example, there are some purely collocational restrictions in English that seem to enforce no semantic 
distinction. Thus, one can roast chicken and peanuts in an oven, but typically fish and beans are baked 
rather than roasted: this fact seems to be a quirk of the history of English. Polysemy provides a second 
kind of complication. A sentence can be parsed and a sentence can be commuted, but these are two 
distinct senses of the word sentence; we should not be misled into positing a class of things that can be 
both parsed and commuted. 
3. Much of the work on language modeling for speech recognition has tended to concentrate on search questions. Should we still 
be using Bates' island riving approach (Bates 1975), or should we try something ewer such as Tomita's o-called generalized 
LR(k) parser (Tomita 1986)7 We suggest that he discussion should concentrate more on describing the facts, and less on how 
they are enforced. 
80 
Given these complicating factors, it is by no means obvious that the distribution of words will directly 
provide a useful semantic lassification, at least in the absence of considerable human intervention. The 
work that has been done based on Harris' distributional hypothesis (most notably, the work of the 
associates of the Linguistic String Project (see for example, Hirschman, Grishman, and Sager 1975)) 
unfortunately does not provide a direct answer, since the corpora used have been small (tens of 
thousands of words rather than millions) and the analysis has typically involved considerable 
intervention by the researchers. However, with much larger corpora (10-100 million words) and robust 
parsers and taggers, the early results reported here and elsewhere appear extremely promising.
