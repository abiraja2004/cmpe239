Abstract 
We propose an intention analysis system 
for instant messaging applications.  The 
system adopts Yahoo! directory as category 
trees, and classifies each dialogue into one 
of the categories of the directory. Two 
weighting schemes in information retrieval, 
i.e., tf and tf-idf, are considered in our ex-
periments.  In addition, we also expand 
Yahoo! directory with the accompanying 
HTML files and explore different features 
such as nouns, verbs, hypernym, hyponym, 
etc.  Experiments show that category trees 
expanded with snippets together with noun 
features under tf scheme achieves a best F-
score, 0.86, when only 37.46% of utter-
ances are processed on the average.  This 
methodology is employed to recommend 
advertisements relevant to the dialogue. 
1 Introduction 
Instant messaging applications such as Google 
Talk, Microsoft MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messen-
ger, QQ, and Skype are very popular.  In the 
blooming instant messaging markets, sponsor links 
and advertisements support the free service.  Fig-
ure 1 shows an example of sponsor links in instant 
message applications.  They are usually randomly 
proposed and may be irrelevant to the utterance.  
Thus, they may not attract users? attentions and 
have no effects on advertisements.  This paper 
deals with the analysis of intention in the dialogues 
and the recommendation of relevant sponsor links 
in an ongoing conversation. 
In the related works, Fain and Pedersen (2006) 
survey sponsored search, suggesting the impor-
tance of matching advertising content to user inten-
tions.  How to match advertiser content to user 
queries is an important issue.  Yih et al (2006) 
aimed at extracting advertisement keywords from 
the intention on the web pages.  However, these 
works did not address the issues in dialogues. 
 
Figure 1.  A Sponsor Link in an IM Application 
In conventional dialogue management, how to 
extract semantic concepts, identify the speech act, 
and formulate the dialogue state transitions are im-
portant tasks.  The domain shift is a challenging 
problem (Lin and Chen, 2004).  In instant message 
applications, more challenging issues have to be 
tackled.  Firstly, the discussing topics of dialogues 
are diverse.  Secondly, the conversation may be 
quite short, so that the system should be responsive 
instantly when detecting the intention.  Thirdly, the 
utterance itself can be purely free-style and far be-
yond the formal grammar.  That is, self-defined or 
symbolic languages may be used in the dialogues.  
The following shows some example utterances. 
 James: dud, i c ur foto on Kelly?s door~  ^^|| 
 Antony: Orz?.kill me pls. >< 
An intention detecting system has to extract words 
from incomplete sentences in dialogues. Fourthly, 
the system should consider up-to-date terms, in-
stead of just looking up conventional dictionaries.

Capturing the intention in a dialogue and rec-
ommending the advertisements before its ending 
are the goal of this approach.  This paper is organ-
ized as follows.  Section 2 shows an overview of 
the system architecture.  Section 3 discusses the 
category trees and the weighting functions for 
identifying the intention.  Section 4 presents the 
experimental results comparing with different uses 
of the category trees and word features.  Section 5 
concludes and remarks. 
2 System Overview 
Fain and Pedersen (2006) outlined six basic 
elements for sponsored search.  They are shown as 
follows: 
(1) advertiser-provided content, 
(2) advertiser-provided bids, 
(3) ensuring that advertiser content is relevant 
to the target keyword, 
(4) matching advertiser content to user queries, 
(5) displaying advertiser content in some rank 
order,  
(6) gathering data, metering clicks and charg-
ing advertisers. 
In instant messaging applications, a dialogue is 
composed of several utterances issuing by at least 
two users.  They are different from sponsored 
search in that advertiser content is matched to user 
utterances instead of user queries.  While reading 
users? conversation, an intention detecting system 
recommends suitable advertiser information at a 
suitable time.  The time of the recommendation 
and the effect of advertisement have a strong rela-
tionship.  The earlier the correct recommendation 
is, the larger the effect is. 
However, time and accuracy are trade-off.  At 
the earlier stages of a dialogue, the system may 
have deficient information to predict suitable ad-
vertisement.  Thus, a false advertisement may be 
proposed.  On the other hand, the system may have 
enough information at the later stages.  However, 
users may complete their talk at any time in this 
case, so the advertisement effect may be lowered.   
Figure 2 shows architecture of our system.  In 
each round of the conversation, we retrieve an ut-
terance from a given instant message application.  
Then, we parse the utterance and try to predict in-
tention of the dialogue based on current and previ-
ous utterances, and consult the advertisement data-
bases that provide sponsor links accordingly.  If 
the information in the utterances is enough for pre-
diction, then several candidates are proposed.  Fi-
nally, based on predefined criteria, the best candi-
date is selected and proposed to the IM application 
as the sponsor link in Figure 1. 
In the following sections, we will explore when 
to make sure the intention of a dialogue with con-
fidence and to propose suitable recommendations.  
In addition, we will also discuss what word fea-
tures (called cue words hereafter) in the utterances 
are useful for the intention determination.  We as-
sume sponsor links or advertisements are adjunct 
on the given category trees.

3 Categorization of Dialogues 
3.1 Web Directory Used for Categorization 
We employ Yahoo! directory1 to assign a dialogue 
or part of a dialogue in category representing its 
intention.  Every word in dialogues is classified by 
the directory.  For example, by searching the term 
BMW, we could retrieve the category path: 
  >Business and Economy>? Makers>Vehicles 
Each category contains subcategories, which in-
clude some subsidiary categories. Therefore, we 
could take the directory as a hierarchical tree for 
searching the intention.  Moreover, each node of 
the tree has attributes from the node itself and its 
ancestors.  Our idea is to summarize all intentions 
from words in a dialog, and then conclude the in-
tention accordingly. 
The nodes sometimes are overlapped, that is, 
one node could be found in more than one path. 
For example, the car maker BMW has at least two 
other nodes: 
                                                 
1 http://dir.yahoo.com 
626
  >Regional>Countries>Germany>Business and 
     Economy>?>Dealers 
  >Recreation>Automotive>?Clubs and Organi- 
    zations>BMW Car Club of America 
The categories of BMW include Business and 
Economy, Regional, and Recreation.  This demon-
strates the nature of the word ambiguity, and is 
challenging when the system identifies the inten-
tion embedded in the dialogs. 
The downloaded Yahoo! directory brings up 
HTML documents with three basic elements, in-
cluding titles, links and snippet as shown in Figure 
3.  The following takes the three elements from a 
popular site as an example. 
Title: The White House  
Link: www.WhiteHouse.gov  
Snippet: Features statements and press releases 
by President George W. Bush as well? 
 
Figure 3. Sample HTML in Yahoo! Directory Tree 
We will explore different ways to use the three 
elements during intention identification. Table 1 
shows different models and total nodes.  YahooO 
and YahooX are two extreme cases.  The former 
employs the original category tree, while the latter 
expands the category tree with titles, links and 
snippets.  Thus, the former contains 7,839 nodes 
and the latter 78,519 nodes. 
 
Table 1.  Tree Expansion Scenarios 
 
Table 2.  Examples of Expanded Nodes 
Table 2 lists some examples to demonstrate the 
category tree expansion.  Some words inside the 
three elements rarely appear in dictionaries or en-
cyclopedias. Thus, we can summarize these trees 
and build a new dictionary with definitions.  For 
example, we could find the hottest web sites You-
Tube and MySpace, and even the most popular 
Chinese gamble game, Mahjong. 
3.2 Scoring Functions for Categorization  
Given a fragment F of a dialogue, which is com-
posed of utterances reading up to now, Formula 1 
determines the intention IINT of F by counting total 
scores of cue words w in F contributing to I.   
?
?
?=
Fw
INT IwbwtfI ),()(maxarg  (1)
where tf(w) is term frequency of w in F, and b(w,I) 
is 1 when w is in the paths corresponding to the 
intention IINT; b(w,I) is 0 otherwise. 
Formula 2 considers the discriminating capabil-
ity of each cue word.  It is similar to tf-idf scheme 
in information retrieval.

total intentions in which w appears. 
3.3 Features of Cue Words 
The features of possible cue words including nouns,
verbs, stop-words, word length, hypernym, hypo-
nym, and synonym are sum
627
 
Table 3.  Cue Words Explored 
Nouns and verbs form skeletons of concepts are 
important cues for similarity measures (Chen et al, 
2003), so that they are considered as features in our 
model.  Word length is used to filter out some un-
necessary words because the shorter the word is, 
the less meaningful the word might be.  Here we 
postulate that instant messaging users are not will-
ing to type long terms if unnecessary. 
In this paper, we regard words in an utterance of 
dialogues as query terms.  Rosie et al (2006) 
showed that query substitution may be helpful to 
retrieve more meaningful results.  Here, we use 
hypernym, hyponym and synonym specified in 
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to expand the original 
utterance.  
3.4 Candidate Recommendation 
The proposed model also provides the ability to 
show the related advertisements after intention is 
confirmed.  As discussed, for each of node in the 
category tree, there is an accompanying HTML file 
to show some related web sites and even sponsors. 
Therefore, we can also use the category tree to put 
sponsor links into the HTML files, and just fetch 
the sponsor links from the HTML file on the node 
to the customers. 
The algorithm to select the suitable candidates 
could be shortly described as the Longest Path 
First.  Once we select the category of the intention, 
the nodes appearing in the chosen category will 
then be collected into a set. We will check the 
longest path and provide the sponsor links from the 
node. 
4 Experimental Results 
4.1 Performance of Different Models 
To prepare the experimental materials, we col-
lected 50 real dialogs from end-users, and asked 
annotators to tag the 50 dialogs with 14 given Ya-
hoo! directory categories shown in Table 4.  Aver-
age number of sentences is 12.38 and average 
number of words is 56.04 in each dialog.  We 
compare the system output with the answer keys, 
and compute precision, recall, and F-score for each 
method. 
 
Table 4.  Category Abbreviation 
Table 5 shows the performance of using For-
mula 1 (i.e., tf scheme).  This model is a combina-
tion of a scenario shown in Table 1 and features 
shown in Table 3.  For example, the YahooS-noun 
matches cue words of POS noun from utterances to 
the category tree expanded with snippets.  WL de-
notes word length.  Only cue words of length ? 
WL is considered.  C denotes the number of dia-
logues correctly analyzed.  NA denotes the number 
of undecidable dialogues.  P, R and F denote preci-
sion, recall and F-score. 
Table 5 shows that YahooS with noun features 
achieves a best performance.  Noun feature works 
impressively well with the orders, YahooS, Ya-
hooT, YahooX, and YahooL.  That meets our ex-
pectation because the information from snippets is 
well enough and does not bring in noise as the Ya-
hooX.  YahooT, however, has good but insufficient 
information, while YahooL is only suitable for dia-
logs directly related to links.  
Moreover, the experimental results show that 
verb is not a good feature no matter whether the 
category tree is expanded or not.  Although some 
verbs can explicitly point out the intention of dia-
logues, such as buy, sell, purchase, etc, the lack of 
verbs in Yahoo! directory makes the verb features 
less useful in the experiments.  Table 6 shows the 
performance of using Formula 2 (i.e., tf-idf 
scheme).  The original category tree with hyponym 
achieves the best performance, i.e., 56.56%.  How-
ever, it cannot compete with most of models with tf 
scheme.

4.2 Hit Speed 
Besides precision, recall and F-score, we are al-
so interested if the system captures the intention of 
the dialogue at better timing.  We define one more 
metric called hit speed in Formula (3).  It repre-
sents how fast the sponsor links could be correctly 
suggested during the progress of conversations.  
For each utterance in a dialogue, we mark either X 
or a predicted category.  Here X denotes undecid-
able. 
Assume we have a dialogue of 7 utterances and 
consider the following scenario.  At first, our sys-
tem could not propose any candidates in the first 
two utterances.  Then, it decides the third and the 
fourth utterances are talking about Business and 
Economy.  Finally, it determines the intention of 
the dialogue is Computer and Internet after reading 
the next three utterances.  In this example, we get 
an answer string, XXBBCCC, based on the nota-
tions shown in Table 4.  If the intention annotated 
by human is Computer and Internet, then the sys-
tem starts proposing a correct intention from the 5th 
utterance.  In other words, the information in the 
first 4 utterances is not sufficient to make any deci-
sion or make wrong decision.   
Let CPL be the length of correct postfix of an 
answer string, e.g., 3, and N be total utterances in a 
dialogue, e.g., 7.  HitSpeed is defined as follows. 
N
CPL
HitSpeed =  (3)
In this case, the hit speed of intention identification 
is 3/7.  Intuitively, our goal is to get the hit speed 
as high as possible.  The sooner we get the correct 
intention, the better the recommendation effect is. 
The average hit speed is defined by Formulas (4) 
and (5).  The former considers only the correct dia-
logues, and the latter considers all the dialogues.  
Let M and N denote total dialogues and total cor-
rect dialogues, respectively. 
N
HitSpeed
vgHitSpeed
M
i i? == 1A  (4)
M
HitSpeed
vgHitSpeed
M
i i? == 1A  (5)

Figure 5.  Average Hit Speed by Formula (5) 
629
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate average hit speeds 
computed by Formulas (4) and (5), respectively.   
Here four leading models shown in Table 5 are 
adopted and nouns are regarded as cue words. Fig-
ure 4 shows that the average hit speed in correctly 
answered dialogues is around 70%.  It means these 
models can correctly answer the intention when a 
dialogue still has 70% to go in the set of correctly 
answered dialogs. 
Figure 5 considers all the dialogues no matter 
whether their intentions are identified correctly or 
not.  We can still capture the intention with the hit 
speed 62.54% for the best model, i.e., YahooS-
noun.   
5 Concluding Remarks 
This paper captures intention in dialogues of in-
stant messaging applications.  A web directory 
such as Yahoo! directory is considered as a cate-
gory tree.  Two schemes, revised tf and tf-idf, are 
employed to classify the utterances in dialogues.  
The experiments show that the tf scheme using the 
category tree expanded with snippets together with 
noun features achieves the best F-score, 0.86.  The 
hit speed evaluation tells us the system can start 
making good decision when near only 37.46% of 
total utterances are processed.  In other words, the 
recommended advertisements can be placed to at-
tract users? attentions in the rest 62.54% of total 
utterances. 
Though the best model in the experiments is to 
use nouns as features, we note that another impor-
tant language feature, verbs, is not helpful due to 
the characteristic of the category tree we adopted, 
that is, the absence of verbs in Yahoo! directory. If 
some other data sources can provide the cue infor-
mation, verbs may be taken as useful features to 
boost the performance.  
In this paper, only one intention is assigned to 
the utterances.  However, there may be many par-
ticipants involving in a conversation, and the topics 
they are talking about in a dialogue may be more 
than one. For example, two couples are discussing 
a trip schedule together.  After the topic is finished, 
they may continue the conversation for selection of 
hotels and buying funds separately in the same in-
stant messaging dialogue.  In this case, our system 
only decides the intention is Recreation, but not 
including Business & Economy.  
Long time delay of response is another interest-
ing topic for instant messaging dialogues. Some-
times one participant could send a message, but 
have to wait for minutes or even hours to get re-
sponse.  Because the receiver might be absent, 
busy or just off-line, the system should be capable 
of waiting such a long time delay before a com-
plete dialogue is finished in practical applications. 
Opinion mining is also important to the pro-
posed model.  For example, dialogue participants 
may talk about buying digital cameras, and one of 
them has negative opinions on some products.  In 
such a case, an intelligent recommendation system 
should not promote such products.  Once opinion 
extraction is introduced to intention analysis sys-
tems, customers can get not only the conversation-
related, but also personally preferred sponsor links.
