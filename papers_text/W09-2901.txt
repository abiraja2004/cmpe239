Abstract
Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are one
of the stumbling blocks for more precise
Natural Language Processing (NLP) sys-
tems. Particularly, the lack of coverage
of MWEs in resources can impact nega-
tively on the performance of tasks and ap-
plications, and can lead to loss of informa-
tion or communication errors. This is es-
pecially problematic in technical domains,
where a significant portion of the vocab-
ulary is composed of MWEs. This pa-
per investigates the use of a statistically-
driven alignment-based approach to the
identification of MWEs in technical cor-
pora. We look at the use of several sources
of data, including parallel corpora, using
English and Portuguese data from a corpus
of Pediatrics, and examining how a sec-
ond language can provide relevant cues for
this tasks. We report results obtained by
a combination of statistical measures and
linguistic information, and compare these
to the reported in the literature. Such an
approach to the (semi-)automatic identifi-
cation of MWEs can considerably speed
up lexicographic work, providing a more
targeted list of MWE candidates.
1 Introduction
A multiword expression (MWE) can be defined
as any word combination for which the syntac-
tic or semantic properties of the whole expres-
sion cannot be obtained from its parts (Sag et
al., 2002). Examples of MWEs are phrasal verbs
(break down, rely on), compounds (police car, cof-
fee machine), idioms (rock the boat, let the cat
out of the bag). They are very numerous in lan-
guages, as Biber et al (1999) note, accouting for
between 30% and 45% of spoken English and 21%
of academic prose, and for Jackendoff (1997) the
number of MWEs in a speaker?s lexicon is of the
same order of magnitude as the number of single
words. However, these estimates are likely to be
underestimates if we consider that for language
from a specific domain the specialized vocabulary
is going to consist largely of MWEs (global warm-
ing, protein sequencing) and new MWEs are con-
stantly appearing (weapons of mass destruction,
axis of evil).
Multiword expressions play an important role
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applica-
tions, which should not only identify the MWEs
but also be able to deal with them when they are
found (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007). Failing to
identify MWEs may cause serious problems for
many NLP tasks, especially those envolving some
kind of semantic processing. For parsing, for in-
stance, Baldwin et al (2004), found that for a ran-
dom sample of 20,000 strings from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) even with a broad-coverage
grammar for English (Flickinger, 2000) missing
MWEs accounted for 8% of total parsing errors.
Therefore, there is an enormous need for robust
(semi-)automated ways of acquiring lexical infor-
mation for MWEs (Villavicencio et al, 2007) that
can significantly extend the coverage of resources.
For example, one can more than double the num-
ber of verb-particle constructions (VPCs) entries
in a dictionary, such as the Alvey Natural Lan-
guage Tools (Carroll and Grover, 1989), just ex-
tracting VPCs from a corpus like the BNC (Bald-
win, 2005). Furthermore, as MWEs are language
dependent and culturally motivated, identifying
the adequate translation of MWE occurrences is an
important challenge for machine translation meth-
ods.
In this paper, we investigate experimentally the
use of an alignment-based approach for the iden-
tification of MWEs in technical corpora. We look
at the use of several sources of data, including par-
1
allel corpora, using English and Portuguese data
from a corpus of Pediatrics, and examining how
a second language can provide relevant cues for
this tasks. In this way, cost-effective tools for the
automatic alignment of texts can generate a list
of MWE candidates with their appropriate trans-
lations. Such an approach to the (semi-)automatic
identification of MWEs can considerably speed up
lexicographic work, providing a more targeted list
of MWE candidates and their translations, for the
construction of bilingual resources, and/or with
some semantic information for monolingual re-
sources.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 briefly discusses MWEs and some
previous works on methods for automatically ex-
tracting them. Section 3 presents the resources
used while section 4 describes the methods pro-
posed to extract MWEs as a statistically-driven by-
product of an automatic word alignment process.
Section 5 presents the evaluation methodology and
analyses the results and section 6 finishes this pa-
per with some conclusions and proposals for fu-
ture work.
2 Related Work
The term Multiword Expression has been used to
describe a large number of distinct but related phe-
nomena, such as phrasal verbs (e.g. come along),
nominal compounds (e.g. frying pan), institution-
alised phrases (e.g. bread and butter), and many
others (Sag et al, 2002). They are very frequent in
everyday language and this is reflected in several
existing grammars and lexical resources, where
almost half of the entries are Multiword Expres-
sions.
However, due to their heterogeneous charac-
teristics, MWEs present a tough challenge for
both linguistic and computational work (Sag et
al., 2002). Some MWEs are fixed, and do not
present internal variation, such as ad hoc, while
others allow different degrees of internal vari-
ability and modification, such as touch a nerve
(touch/find a nerve) and spill beans (spill sev-
eral/musical/mountains of beans). In terms of se-
mantics, some MWEs are more opaque in their
meaning (e.g. to kick the bucket as to die), while
others have more transparent meanings that can be
inferred from the words in the MWE (e.g. eat up,
where the particle up adds a completive sense to
eat). Therefore, providing appropriate methods
for the automatic identification and treatment of
these phenomena is a real challenge for NLP sys-
tems.
A variety of approaches has been proposed for
automatically identifying MWEs, differing basi-
cally in terms of the type of MWE and lan-
guage to which they apply, and the sources of
information they use. Although some work on
MWEs is type independent (e.g. (Zhang et al,
2006; Villavicencio et al, 2007)), given the het-
erogeneity of MWEs much of the work looks in-
stead at specific types of MWE like collocations
(Pearce, 2002), compounds (Keller and Lapata,
2003) and VPCs (Baldwin, 2005; Villavicencio,
2005; Carlos Ramisch and Aline Villavicencio and
Leonardo Moura and Marco Idiart, 2008). Some
of these works concentrate on particular languages
(e.g. (Pearce, 2002; Baldwin, 2005) for English
and (Piao et al, 2006) for Chinese), but some
work has also benefitted from asymmetries in lan-
guages, using information from one language to
help deal with MWEs in the other (e.g. (na Vil-
lada Moiro?n and Tiedemann, 2006; Caseli et al,
2009)).
As basis for helping to determine whether a
given sequence of words is in fact an MWE (e.g.
ad hoc vs the small boy) some of these works em-
ploy linguistic knowledge for the task (Villavicen-
cio, 2005), while others employ statistical meth-
ods (Pearce, 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005; Zhang
et al, 2006; Villavicencio et al, 2007) or combine
them with some kinds of linguistic information
such as syntactic and semantic properties (Bald-
win and Villavicencio, 2002; Van de Cruys and na
Villada Moiro?n, 2007) or automatic word align-
ment (na Villada Moiro?n and Tiedemann, 2006).
Statistical measures of association have been
commonly used for this task, as they can be demo-
cratically applied to any language and MWE type.
However, there is no consensus about which mea-
sure is best suited for identifying MWEs in gen-
eral. Villavicencio et al (2007) compared some of
these measures (mutual information, permutation
entropy and ?2) for the type-independent detec-
tion of MWEs and found that Mutual Information
seemed to differentiate MWEs from non-MWEs,
but the same was not true of ?2. In addition, Ev-
ert and Krenn (2005) found that for MWE iden-
tification the efficacy of a given measure depends
on factors like the type of MWEs being targeted
for identification, the domain and size of the cor-
2
pora used, and the amount of low-frequency data
excluded by adopting a threshold. Nonetheless,
Villavicencio et al (2007), discussing the influ-
ence of the corpus size and nature over the meth-
ods, found that these different measures have a
high level of agreement about MWEs, whether
in carefully constructed corpora or in more het-
erogeneous web-based ones. They also discuss
the results obtained from adopting approaches like
these for extending the coverage of resources, ar-
guing that grammar coverage can be significantly
increased if MWEs are properly identified and
treated (Villavicencio et al, 2007).
Among the methods that use additional infor-
mation along with statistics to extract MWE, the
one proposed by na Villada Moiro?n and Tiede-
mann (2006) seems to be the most similar to our
approach. The main difference between them is
the way in which word alignment is used in the
MWE extraction process. In this paper, the word
alignment is the basis for the MWE extraction
process while Villada Moiro?n and Tiedemann?s
method uses the alignment just for ranking the
MWE candidates which were extracted on the ba-
sis of association measures (log-likelihood and
salience) and head dependence heuristic (in parsed
data).
Our approach, as described in details by Caseli
et al (2009), also follows to some extent that
of Zhang et al (2006), as missing lexical en-
tries for MWEs and related constructions are de-
tected via error mining methods, and this paper fo-
cuses on the extraction of generic MWEs as a by-
product of an automatic word alignment. Another
related work is the automatic detection of non-
compositional compounds (NCC) by Melamed
(1997) in which NCCs are identified by analyz-
ing statistical translation models trained in a huge
corpus by a time-demanding process.
Given this context, our approach proposes
the use of alignment techniques for identifying
MWEs, looking at sequences detected by the
aligner as containing more than one word, which
form the MWE candidates. As a result, sequences
of two or more consecutive source words are
treated as MWE candidates regardless of whether
they are translated as one or more target words.
3 The Corpus and Reference Lists
The Corpus of Pediatrics used in these experi-
ments contains 283 texts in Portuguese with a total
of 785,448 words, extracted from the Jornal de Pe-
diatria. From this corpus, the Pediatrics Glossary,
a reference list containing multiword terms and re-
curring expressions, was semi-automatically con-
structed, and manually checked.1 The primary aim
of the Pediatrics Glossary, as an online resource
for long-distance education, was to train, qualify
and support translation students on the domain of
pediatrics texts.
The Pediatrics Glossary was built from the
36,741 ngrams that occurred at least 5 times in the
corpus. These were automatically cleaned or re-
moved using some POS tag patterns (e.g. remov-
ing prepositions from terms that began or ended
with them). In addition, if an ngram was part of a
larger ngram, only the latter appeared in the Glos-
sary, as is the case of aleitamento materno (mater-
nal breastfeeding) which is excluded as it is con-
tained in aleitamento materno exclusivo (exclusive
maternal breastfeeding). This post-processing re-
sulted in 3,645 ngrams, which were manually
checked by translation students, and resulted in
2,407 terms, with 1,421 bigrams, 730 trigrams and
339 ngrams with n larger than 3 (not considered in
the experiments presented in this paper).
4 Statistically-Driven and
Alignment-Based methods
4.1 Statistically-Driven method
Statistical measures of association have been
widely employed in the identification of MWEs.
The idea behind their use is that they are an in-
expensive language and type independent means
of detecting recurrent patterns. As Firth famously
said a word is characterized by the company it
keeps and since we expect the component words
of an MWE to occur frequently together, then
these measures can give an indication of MWE-
ness. In this way, if a group of words co-occurs
with significantly high frequency when compared
to the frequencies of the individual words, then
they may form an MWE. Indeed, measures such
as Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), Mutual
Information (MI), ?2, log-likelihood (Press et al,
1992) and others have been employed for this
task, and some of them seem to provide more ac-
curate predictions of MWEness than others. In
fact, in a comparison of some measures for the
type-independent detection of MWEs, MI seemed

to differentiate MWEs from non-MWEs, but the
same was not true of ?2 (Villavicencio et al,
2007). In this work we use two commonly em-
ployed measures for this task: PMI and MI,
as implemented in the Ngram Statistics Package
(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).
From the Portuguese portion of the Corpus of
Pediatrics, 196,105 bigram and 362,663 trigram
MWE candidates were generated, after filtering
ngrams containing punctuation and numbers. In
order to evaluate how these methods perform with-
out any linguistic filtering, the only threshold em-
ployed was a frequency cut-off of 2 occurrences,
resulting in 64,839 bigrams and 54,548 trigrams.
Each of the four measures were then calculated for
these ngrams, and we ranked each n-gram accord-
ing to each of these measures. The average of all
the rankings is used as the combined measure of
the MWE candidates.
4.2 Alignment-Based method
The second of the MWE extraction approaches
to be investigated in this paper is the alignment-
based method. The automatic word alignment of
two parallel texts ? a text written in one (source)
language and its translation to another (target) lan-
guage ? is the process of searching for correspon-
dences between source and target words and se-
quences of words. For each word in a source sen-
tence equivalences in the parallel target sentence
are looked for. Therefore, taking into account a
word alignment between a source word sequence
S (S = s1 . . . sn with n ? 2) and a target word
sequence T (T = t1 . . . tm with m ? 1), that
is S ? T , the alignmet-based MWE extracion
method assumes that: (a) S and T share some se-
mantic features, and (b) S may be a MWE.
In other words, the alignment-based MWE ex-
traction method states that the sequence S will be
a MWE candidate if it is aligned with a sequence
T composed of one or more words (a n : m align-
ment with n ? 2 and m ? 1). For example,
the sequence of two Portuguese words aleitamento
materno ? which occurs 202 times in the cor-
pus used in our experiments ? is a MWE can-
didate because these two words were joined to be
aligned 184 times with the word breastfeeding (a
2 : 1 alignment), 8 times with the word breast-
fed (a 2 : 1 alignment), 2 times with breastfeeding
practice (a 2 : 2 alignment) and so on.
Thus, notice that the alignment-based MWE ex-
traction method does not rely on the conceptual
asymmetries between languages since it does not
expect that a source sequence of words be aligned
with a single target word. The method looks
for the sequences of source words that are fre-
quently joined together during the alignment de-
spite the number of target words involved. These
features indicate that the method priorizes preci-
sion in spite of recall.
It is also important to say that although the se-
quences of source and target words resemble the
phrases used in the phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT), they are indeed a re-
finement of them. More specifically, although
both approaches rely on word alignments per-
formed by GIZA++2 (Och and Ney, 2000), in
the alignment-based approach not all sequences of
words are considered as phrases (and MWE can-
didates) but just those with an alignment n : m
(n >= 2) with a target sequence. To confirm
this assumption a phrase-based SMT system was
trained with the same corpus used in our exper-
iments and the number of phrases extracted fol-
lowing both approaches were compared. While
the SMT extracted 819,208 source phrases, our
alignment-based approach (without applying any
part-of-speech or frequency filter) extracted only
34,277. These results show that the alignment-
based approach refines in some way the phrases
of SMT systems.
In this paper, we investigate experimentally
whether MWEs can be identified as a by-product
of the automatic word alignment of parallel texts.
We focus on Portuguese MWEs from the Corpus
of Pediatrics and the evaluation is performed us-
ing the bigrams and trigrams from the Pediatrics
Glossary as gold standard.
To perform the extraction of MWE candi-
dates following the alignment-based approach,
first, the original corpus had to be sentence and
word aligned and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagged.
For these preprocessing steps were used, re-
spectively: a version of the Translation Cor-
pus Aligner (TCA) (Hofland, 1996), the statisti-
cal word aligner GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000)
and the morphological analysers and POS taggers
from Apertium3 (Armentano-Oller et al, 2006).
2GIZA++ is a well-known statistical word aligner that can
be found at: http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html
3Apertium is an open-source machine translation en-
gine and toolbox available at: http://www.apertium.
org.
4
From the preprocessed corpus, the MWE candi-
dates are extracted as those in which two or more
words have the same alignment, that is, they are
linked to the same target unit. This initial list of
MWE candidates is, then, filtered to remove those
candidates that: (a) match some sequences of POS
tags or words (patterns) defined in previous exper-
iments (Caseli et al, 2009) or (b) whose frequency
is below a certain threshold. The remaining units
in the candidate list are considered to be MWEs.
Several filtering patterns and minimum fre-
quency thresholds were tested and three of them
are presented in details here. The first one (F1)
is the same used during the manual building of
the reference lists of MWEs: (a) patterns begin-
ning with Article + Noun and beginning or finish-
ing with verbs and (b) with a minimum frequency
threshold of 5.
The second one (F2) is the same used in the
(Caseli et al, 2009), mainly: (a) patterns begin-
ning with determiner, auxiliary verb, pronoun, ad-
verb, conjunction and surface forms such as those
of the verb to be (are, is, was, were), relatives
(that, what, when, which, who, why) and prepo-
sitions (from, to, of ) and (b) with a minimum fre-
quency threshold of 2.
And the third one (F3) is the same as (Caseli et
al., 2009) plus: (a) patterns beginning or finishing
with determiner, adverb, conjunction, preposition,
verb, pronoun and numeral and (b) with a mini-
mum frequency threshold of 2.
5 Experiments and Results
Table 1 shows the top 5 and the bottom 5 ranked
candidates returned by PMI and the alignment-
based approach. Although some of the results are
good, especially the top candidates, there is still
considerable noise among the candidates, as for
instance jogar video game (lit. play video game).
From table 1 it is also possible to notice that the
alignment-based approach indeed extracts Pedi-
atrics terms such as aleitamento materno (breast-
feeding) and also other possible MWE that are not
Pediatrics terms such as estados unidos (United
States).
In table 2 we show the precision (number of
correct candidates among the proposed ones), re-
call (number of correct candidates among those in
reference lists) and F-measure ((2 ? precision ?
recall)/(precision + recall)) figures for the as-
sociation measures using all the candidates (on the

gram and 730 trigram candidates (on the second
half). From these latter results, we can see that the
top candidates produced by these measures do not
agree with the Pediatrics Glossary, since there are
only at most 18.37% bigram and 6.03% trigram
MWEs among the top candidates, as ranked by
MI and PMI respectively. Interestingly, MI had a
better performance for bigrams while for trigrams
PMI performed better.
On the other hand, looking at the alignment-
based method, 34,277 pt MWE candidates were
extracted and Table 3 sumarizes the number of
candidates filtered following the three filters de-
scribed in 4.2: F1, F2 and F3.
To evaluate the efficacy of the alignment-based
method in identifying multiword terms of Pedi-
atrics, an automatic comparison was performed
using the Pediatrics Glossary. In this auto-

Table 4: Evaluation of MWE candidates
matic comparision we considered the final lists of
MWEs candidates generated by each filter in table
3. The number of matching entries and the values
for precision, recall and F-measure are showed in
table 4.
The different values of extracted MWEs (in ta-
ble 3) and evaluated ones (in table 4) are due to
the restriction of considering only bigrams and tri-
grams in the Pediatrics Glossary. Then, longer
MWEs ? such as doenc?a arterial coronariana
prematura (premature coronary artery disease)
and pequenos para idade gestacional (small for
gestational age) ? extracted by the alignment-
based method are not being considered at the mo-
ment.
After the automatic comparison using the Pedi-
atrics Glossary, an analysis by human experts was
performed on one of the derived lists ? that with
the best precision values so far (from filter F3).
The human analysis was necessary since, as stated
in (Caseli et al, 2009), the coverage of reference
lists may be low, and it is likely that a lot of MWE
candidates that were not found in the Pediatrics
Glossary are nonetheless true MWEs. In this pa-
per only the pt MWE candidates extracted using
filter F3 (as described in section 4.2) were manu-
ally evaluated.
From the 191 pt MWE candidates extracted af-
ter F3, 69 candidates (36.1% of the total amount)
were found in the bigrams or trigrams in the
Glossary (see table 4). Then, the remaining 122
candidates (63.9%) were analysed by two native-
speakers human judges, who classified each of the
122 candidates as true, if it is a multiword expres-
sion, or false, otherwise independently of being
a Pediatrics term. For the judges, a sequence of
words was considered a MWE mainly if it was:
(1) a proper name or (2) a sequence of words for
which the meaning cannot be obtained by com-
pounding the meanings of its component words.
The judgments of both judges were compared
and a disagreement of approximately 12% on mul-
tiwords was verified. This disagreement was also
measured by the kappa (K) measure (Carletta,
1996), with k = 0.73, which does not prevent
conclusions to be drawn. According to Carletta
(1996), among other authors, a value of k between
0.67 and 0.8 indicates a good agreement.
In order to calculate the percentage of true can-
didates among the 122, two approaches can be
followed, depending on what criteria one wants
to emphasize: precision or coverage (not recall
because we are not calculating regarding a refer-
ence list). To emphasize the precision, one should
consider as genuine MWEs only those candidates
classified as true by both judges, on the other hand,
to emphasize the coverage, one should consider
also those candidates classified as true by just one
of them. So, from 191 MWE candidates, 126
(65.97%) were classified as true by both judges
and 145 (75.92%) by at least one of them.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
MWEs are a complex and heterogeneous set of
phenomena that defy attempts to capture them
fully, but due to their role in communication they
need to be properly accounted for in NLP applica-
tions and tasks.
In this paper we investigated the identifica-
tion of MWEs from technical domain, test-
ing statistically-driven and alignment-based ap-
proaches for identifying MWEs from a Pediatrics
parallel corpus. The alignment-based method gen-
erates a targeted precision-oriented list of MWE
candidates, while the statistical methods produce
recall-oriented results at the expense of precision.
Therefore, the combination of these methods can
produce a set of MWE candidates that is both more
precise than the latter and has more coverage than
the former. This can significantly speed up lex-
icographic work. Moreover, the results obtained
6
show that in comparison with the manual extrac-
tion of MWEs, this approach can provide also a
general set of MWE candidates in addition to the
manually selected technical terms.
Using the alignment-based extraction method
we notice that it is possible to extract MWEs that
are Pediatrics terms with a precision of 38% for
bigrams and 20% for trigrams, but with very low
recall since only the MWEs in the Pediatrics Glos-
sary were considered correct. However, after a
manual analysis carried out by two native speakers
of Portuguese we found that the percentage of true
MWEs considered by both or at least one of them
were, respectively, 65.97% and 75.92%. This was
a significative improvement but it is important to
say that, in this manual analysis, the human ex-
perts classified the MWEs as true independently of
them being Pediatrics terms. So, as future work we
intend to carry out a more carefull analysis with
experts in Pediatrics to evaluate how many MWEs
candidates are also Pediatrics terms.
In addition, we plan to investigate a weighted
combination of these methods, favouring those
that have better precision. Finally, we also in-
tend to apply the results obtained in to the semi-
automatic construction of ontologies.
