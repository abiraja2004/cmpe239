Abstract
We present an ensemble-based framework
for semantic lexicon induction that incorpo-
rates three diverse approaches for semantic
class identification. Our architecture brings
together previous bootstrapping methods for
pattern-based semantic lexicon induction and
contextual semantic tagging, and incorpo-
rates a novel approach for inducing semantic
classes from coreference chains. The three
methods are embedded in a bootstrapping ar-
chitecture where they produce independent
hypotheses, consensus words are added to the
lexicon, and the process repeats. Our results
show that the ensemble outperforms individ-
ual methods in terms of both lexicon quality
and instance-based semantic tagging.
1 Introduction
One of the most fundamental aspects of meaning is
the association between words and semantic cate-
gories, which allows us to understand that a ?cow?
is an animal and a ?house? is a structure. We will
use the term semantic lexicon to refer to a dictionary
that associates words with semantic classes. Se-
mantic dictionaries are useful for many NLP tasks,
as evidenced by the widespread use of WordNet
(Miller, 1990). However, off-the-shelf resources are
not always sufficient for specialized domains, such
as medicine, chemistry, or microelectronics. Fur-
thermore, in virtually every domain, texts contain
lexical variations that are often missing from dic-
tionaries, such as acronyms, abbreviations, spelling
variants, informal shorthand terms (e.g., ?abx? for
?antibiotics?), and composite terms (e.g., ?may-
december? or ?virus/worm?). To address this prob-
lem, techniques have been developed to automate
the construction of semantic lexicons from text cor-
pora using bootstrapping methods (Riloff and Shep-
herd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Phillips and
Riloff, 2002; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Ng, 2007;
McIntosh and Curran, 2009; McIntosh, 2010), but
accuracy is still far from perfect.
Our research explores the use of ensemble meth-
ods to improve the accuracy of semantic lexicon in-
duction. Our observation is that semantic class as-
sociations can be learned using several fundamen-
tally different types of corpus analysis. Bootstrap-
ping methods for semantic lexicon induction (e.g.,
(Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002;
McIntosh and Curran, 2009)) collect corpus-wide
statistics for individual words based on shared con-
textual patterns. In contrast, classifiers for semantic
tagging (e.g., (Collins and Singer, 1999; Niu et al.,
2003; Huang and Riloff, 2010)) label word instances
and focus on the local context surrounding each in-
stance. The difference between these approaches is
that semantic taggers make decisions based on a sin-
gle context and can assign different labels to differ-
ent instances, whereas lexicon induction algorithms
compile corpus statistics from multiple instances of
a word and typically assign each word to a single
semantic category.1 We also hypothesize that coref-
erence resolution can be exploited to infer semantic
1This approach would be untenable for broad-coverage se-
mantic knowledge acquisition, but within a specialized domain
most words have a dominant word sense. Our experimental re-
sults support this assumption.
199
class labels. Intuitively, if we know that two noun
phrases are coreferent, then they probably belong to
the same high-level semantic category (e.g., ?dog?
and ?terrier? are both animals).
In this paper, we present an ensemble-based
framework for semantic lexicon induction. We in-
corporate a pattern-based bootstrapping method for
lexicon induction, a contextual semantic tagger, and
a new coreference-based method for lexicon induc-
tion. Our results show that coalescing the decisions
produced by diverse methods produces a better dic-
tionary than any individual method alone.
A second contribution of this paper is an analysis
of the effectiveness of dictionaries for semantic tag-
ging. In principle, an NLP system should be able to
assign different semantic labels to different senses
of a word. But within a specialized domain, most
words have a dominant sense and we argue that us-
ing domain-specific dictionaries for tagging may be
equally, if not more, effective. We analyze the trade-
offs between using an instance-based semantic tag-
ger versus dictionary lookup on a collection of dis-
ease outbreak articles. Our results show that the in-
duced dictionaries yield better performance than an
instance-based semantic tagger, achieving higher ac-
curacy with comparable levels of recall.
2 Related Work
Several techniques have been developed for seman-
tic class induction (also called set expansion) using
bootstrapping methods that consider co-occurrence
statistics based on nouns (Riloff and Shepherd,
1997), syntactic structures (Roark and Charniak,
1998; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), and contextual pat-
terns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff,
2002; McIntosh and Curran, 2008; McIntosh and
Curran, 2009). To improve the accuracy of in-
duced lexicons, some research has incorporated neg-
ative information from human judgements (Vyas
and Pantel, 2009), automatically discovered neg-
ative classes (McIntosh, 2010), and distributional
similarity metrics to recognize concept drift (McIn-
tosh and Curran, 2009). Phillips and Riloff (2002)
used co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) to ex-
ploit three simple classifiers that each recognized a
different type of syntactic structure. The research
most closely related to ours is an ensemble-based
method for automatic thesaurus construction (Cur-
ran, 2002). However, that goal was to acquire fine-
grained semantic information that is more akin to
synonymy (e.g., words similar to ?house?), whereas
we associate words with high-level semantic classes
(e.g., a ?house? is a transient structure).
Semantic class tagging is closely related to named
entity recognition (NER) (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1997;
Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky,
1999; Fleischman and Hovy, 2002)). Some boot-
strapping methods have been used for NER (e.g.,
(Collins and Singer, 1999; Niu et al., 2003) to
learn from unannotated texts. However, most NER
systems will not label nominal noun phrases (e.g.,
they will not identify ?the dentist? as a person)
or recognize semantic classes that are not associ-
ated with proper named entities (e.g., symptoms).2
ACE mention detection systems (e.g., (ACE, 2007;
ACE, 2008)) can label noun phrases that are asso-
ciated with 5-7 semantic classes and are typically
trained with supervised learning. Recently, (Huang
and Riloff, 2010) developed a bootstrapping tech-
nique that induces a semantic tagger from unanno-
tated texts. We use their system in our ensemble.
There has also been work on extracting semantic
class members from the Web (e.g., (Pas?ca, 2004; Et-
zioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008; Carlson et
al., 2009)). This line of research is fundamentally
different from ours because these techniques benefit
from the vast repository of information available on
the Web and are therefore designed to harvest a wide
swath of general-purpose semantic information. Our
research is aimed at acquiring domain-specific se-
mantic dictionaries using a collection of documents
representing a specialized domain.
3 Ensemble-based Semantic Lexicon
Induction
3.1 Motivation
Our research combines three fundamentally differ-
ent techniques into an ensemble-based bootstrap-
ping framework for semantic lexicon induction:
pattern-based dictionary induction, contextual se-
mantic tagging, and coreference resolution. Our
motivation for using an ensemble of different tech-
2Some NER systems will handle special constructions such
as dates and monetary amounts.
200
niques is driven by the observation that these meth-
ods exploit different types of information to infer se-
mantic class knowledge. The coreference resolver
uses features associated with coreference, such as
syntactic constructions (e.g., appositives, predicate
nominals), word overlap, semantic similarity, prox-
imity, etc. The pattern-based lexicon induction al-
gorithm uses corpus-wide statistics gathered from
the contexts of all instances of a word and compares
them with the contexts of known category members.
The contextual semantic tagger uses local context
windows around words and classifies each word in-
stance independently from the others.
Since each technique draws its conclusions from
different types of information, they represent inde-
pendent sources of evidence to confirm whether a
word belongs to a semantic class. Our hypothe-
sis is that, combining these different sources of ev-
idence in an ensemble-based learning framework
should produce better accuracy than using any one
method alone. Based on this intuition, we create
an ensemble-based bootstrapping framework that it-
eratively collects the hypotheses produced by each
individual learner and selects the words that were
hypothesized by at least 2 of the 3 learners. This
approach produces a bootstrapping process with
improved precision, both at the critical beginning
stages of the bootstrapping process and during sub-
sequent bootstrapping iterations.
3.2 Component Systems in the Ensemble
In the following sections, we describe each of the
component systems used in our ensemble.
3.2.1 Pattern-based Lexicon Induction
The first component of our ensemble is Basilisk
(Thelen and Riloff, 2002), which identifies nouns
belonging to a semantic class based on collec-
tive information over lexico-syntactic pattern con-
texts. The patterns are automatically generated us-
ing AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996). Basilisk begins
with a small set of seed words for each seman-
tic class and a collection of unannotated documents
for the domain. In an iterative bootstrapping pro-
cess, Basilisk identifies candidate nouns, ranks them
based on its scoring criteria, selects the 5 most confi-
dent words for inclusion in the lexicon, and this pro-
cess repeats using the new words as additional seeds
in subsequent iterations.
3.2.2 Lexicon Induction with a Contextual
Semantic Tagger
The second component in our ensemble is a con-
textual semantic tagger (Huang and Riloff, 2010).
Like Basilisk, the semantic tagger also begins with
seed nouns, trains itself on a large collection of
unannotated documents using bootstrapping, and it-
eratively labels new instances. This tagger labels
noun instances and does not produce a dictionary.
To adapt it for our purposes, we ran the bootstrap-
ping process over the training texts to induce a se-
mantic classifier. We then applied the classifier to
the same set of training documents and compiled a
lexicon by collecting the set of nouns that were as-
signed to each semantic class. We ignored words
that were assigned different labels in different con-
texts to avoid conflicts in the lexicons. We used
the identical configuration described by (Huang and
Riloff, 2010) that applies a 1.0 confidence threshold
for semantic class assignment.
3.2.3 Coreference-Based Lexicon Construction
The third component of our ensemble is a new
method for semantic lexicon induction that exploits
coreference resolution. Members of a coreference
chain represent the same entity, so all references to
the entity should belong to the same semantic class.
For example, suppose ?Paris? and ?the city? are in
the same coreference chain. If we know that city is
a Fixed Location, then we can infer that Paris is also
a Fixed Location.
We induced lexicons from coreference chains us-
ing a similar bootstrapping framework that begins
with seed nouns and unannotated texts. Let S de-
note a set of semantic classes and W denote a set of
unknown words. For any s ? S and w ? W , let
Ns,w denote the number of instances of s in the cur-
rent lexicon3 that are coreferent with w in the text
corpus. Then we estimate the probability that word
w belongs to semantic class s as:
P (s|w) = Ns,w?
s??S Ns?,w
We hypothesize the semantic class of w,
SemClass(w) by:
SemClass(w) = argmaxs P (s|w)
3In the first iteration, the lexicon is initialized with the seeds.
201
To ensure high precision for the induced lexicons,
we use a threshold of 0.5. All words with a prob-
ability above this thresold are added to the lexicon,
and the bootstrapping process repeats. Although the
coreference chains remain the same throughout the
process, the lexicon grows so more words in the
chains have semantic class labels as bootstrapping
progresses. Bootstrapping ends when fewer than 5
words are learned for each of the semantic classes.
Many noun phrases are singletons (i.e., they are
not coreferent with any other NPs), which limits the
set of words that can be learned using coreference
chains. Furthermore, coreference resolvers make
mistakes, so the accuracy of the induced lexicons
depends on the quality of the chains. For our experi-
ments, we used Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), a
freely available supervised coreference resolver.
3.3 Ensemble-based Bootstrapping
Framework
Figure 1 shows the architecture of our ensemble-
based bootstrapping framework. Initially, each lexi-
con only contains the seed nouns. Each component
hypothesizes a set of candidate words for each se-
mantic class, based on its own criteria. The word
lists produced by the three systems are then com-
pared, and we retain only the words that were hy-
pothesized with the same class label by at least two
of the three systems. The remaining words are dis-
carded. The consenus words are added to the lexi-
con, and the bootstrapping process repeats. As soon
as fewer than 5 words are learned for each of the
semantic classes, bootstrapping stops.
Figure 1: Ensemble-based bootstrapping framework
We ran each individual system with the same seed
words. Since bootstrapping typically yields the best
precision during the earliest stages, we used the se-
mantic tagger?s trained model immediately after its
first bootstrapping iteration. Basilisk generates 5
words per cycle, so we report results for lexicons
generated after 20 bootstrapping cycles (100 words)
and after 80 bootstrapping cycles (400 words).
3.4 Co-Training Framework
The three components in our ensemble use different
types of features (views) to identify semantic class
members, so we also experimented with co-training.
Our co-training model uses an identical framework,
but the hypotheses produced by the different meth-
ods are all added to the lexicon, so each method can
benefit from the hypotheses produced by the others.
To be conservative, each time we added only the 10
most confident words hypothesized by each method.
In contrast, the ensemble approach only adds
words to the lexicon if they are hypothesized by two
different methods. As we will see in Section 4.4,
the ensemble performs much better than co-training.
The reason is that the individual methods do not con-
sistently achieve high precision on their own. Con-
sequently, many mistakes are added to the lexicon,
which is used as training data for subsequent boot-
strapping. The benefit of the ensemble is that con-
sensus is required across two methods, which serves
as a form of cross-checking to boost precision and
maintain a high-quality lexicon.

egories. (e.g., output, information, media, point).
4.2 Data Set
We ran our experiments on ProMED-mail12 articles.
ProMED-mail is an internet based reporting system
for infectious disease outbreaks, which can involve
people, animals, and plants grown for food. Our
ProMED corpus contains 5004 documents. We used
4959 documents as (unannotated) training data for
bootstrapping. For the remaining 45 documents,
we used 22 documents to train the coreference re-
solver (Reconcile) and 23 documents as our test set.
The coreference training set contains MUC-7 style
(Hirschman, 1997) coreference annotations13. Once
trained, Reconcile was applied to the 4959 unanno-
tated documents to produce coreference chains.
4.3 Gold Standard Semantic Class Annotations
To obtain gold standard annotations for the test set,
two annotators assigned one of the 9 semantic class
labels, or Miscellaneous, to each head noun based on
its surrounding context. A noun with multiple senses
could get assigned different semantic class labels in
different contexts. The annotators first annotated 13
of the 23 documents, and discussed the cases where
they disagreed. Then they independelty annotated

13We omit the details of the coreference annotations since
it is not the focus of this research. However, the annotators
measured their agreement on 10 documents and achieved MUC
scores of Precision = .82, Recall = .86, F-measure = .84.
203
the remaining 10 documents and measured inter-
annotator agreement with Cohen?s Kappa (?) (Car-
letta, 1996). The ? score for these 10 documents was
0.91, indicating a high level of agreement. The an-
notators then adjudicated their disagreements on all
23 documents to create the gold standard.
4.4 Dictionary Evaluation
To assess the quality of the lexicons, we estimated
their accuracy by compiling external word lists
from freely available sources such as Wikipedia14
and WordNet (Miller, 1990). Table 1 shows the
sources that we used, where the bracketed items re-
fer to WordNet hypernym categories. We searched
each WordNet hypernym tree (also, instance-
relationship) for all senses of the word. Addition-
ally, we collected the manually labeled words in our
test set and included them in our gold standard lists.
Since the induced lexicons contain individual
nouns, we extracted only the head nouns of multi-
word phrases in the external resources. This
can produce incorrect entries for non-compositional
phrases, but we found this issue to be relatively rare
and we manually removed obviously wrong entries.
We adopted a conservative strategy and assumed that
any lexicon entries not present in our gold standard
lists are incorrect. But we observed many correct en-
tries that were missing from the external resources,
so our results should be interpreted as a lower bound
on the true accuracy of the induced lexicons.
We generated lexicons for each method sepa-
rately, and also for the ensemble and co-training
models. We ran Basilisk for 100 iterations (500
words). We refer to a Basilisk lexicon of size N
using the notation B[N ]. For example, B400 refers
to a lexicon containing 400 words, which was gen-
erated from 80 bootstrapping cycles. We refer to the
lexicon obtained from the semantic tagger as ST Lex.
Figure 2 shows the dictionary evaluation results.
We plotted Basilisk?s accuracy after every 5 boot-
strapping cycles (25 words). For ST Lex, we sorted
the words by their confidence scores and plotted the
accuracy of the top-ranked words in increments of
50. The plots for Coref, Co-Training, and Ensemble
B[N] are based on the lexicons produced after each
bootstrapping cycle.
14www.wikipedia.org/
The ensemble-based framework yields consis-
tently better accuracy than the individual methods
for Animal, Body Part, Human and Temporal Refer-
ence, and similar if not better for Disease & Symp-
tom, Fixed Location, Organization, Plant & Food.
However, relying on consensus from multiple mod-
els produce smaller dictionaries. Big dictionaries are
not always better than small dictionaries in practice,
though. We believe, it matters more whether a dic-
tionary contains the most frequent words for a do-
main, because they account for a disproportionate
number of instances. Basilisk, for example, often
learns infrequent words, so its dictionaries may have
high accuracy but often fail to recognize common
words. We investigate this issue in the next section.
4.5 Instance-based Tagging Evaluation
We also evaluated the effectiveness of the induced
lexicons with respect to instance-based semantic
tagging. Our goal was to determine how useful the
dictionaries are in two respects: (1) do the lexicons
contain words that appear frequently in the domain,
and (2) is dictionary look-up sufficient for instance-
based labeling? Our bootstrapping processes en-
force a constraint that a word can only belong to one
semantic class, so if polysemy is common, then dic-
tionary look-up will be problematic.15
The instance-based evaluation assigns a semantic
label to each instance of a head noun. When using a
lexicon, all instances of the same noun are assigned
the same semantic class via dictionary look-up. The
semantic tagger (SemTag), however, is applied di-
rectly since it was designed to label instances.
Table 2 presents the results. As a baseline, the
W.Net row shows the performance of WordNet for
instance tagging. For words with multiple senses,
we only used the first sense listed in WordNet.
The Seeds row shows the results when perform-
ing dictionary look-up using only the seed words.
The remaining rows show the results for Basilisk
(B100 and B400), coreference-based lexicon induc-
tion (Coref), lexicon induction using the semantic
tagger (ST Lex), and the original instance-based tag-
ger (SemTag). The following rows show the results
for co-training (after 4 iterations and 20 iterations)
15Only coarse polysemy across semantic classes is an issue
(e.g., ?plant? as a living thing vs. a factory).

Figure 2: Dictionary Evaluation Results
and for the ensemble (using Basilisk size 100 and
size 400). Table 3 shows the micro & macro average
results across all semantic categories.
Table 3 shows that the dictionaries produced by
the Ensemble w/B100 achieved better results than
the individual methods and co-training with an F
score of 80%. Table 2 shows that the ensemble
achieved better performance than the other methods
for 4 of the 9 classes, and was usually competitive
on the remaining 5 classes. WordNet (W.Net) con-
sistently produced high precision, but with compar-
atively lower recall, indicating that WordNet does
not have sufficient coverage for this domain.
4.6 Analysis
Table 4 shows the performance of our ensemble
when using only 2 of the 3 component methods.
Removing any one method decreases the average
F-measure by at least 3-5%. Component pairs
that include induced lexicons from coreference (ST
Lex+Coref and B100+Coref) yield high precision
but low recall. The component pair ST Lex+B100
produces higher recall but with slightly lower accu-
racy. The ensemble framework boosted recall even
more, while maintaining the same precision.
We observe that some of the smallest lexicons
produced the best results for instance-based seman-
tic tagging (e.g., Organization). Our hypothesis is
that consensus decisions across different methods
helps to promote the acquisition of high frequency
domain words, which are crucial to have in the dic-
tionary. The fact that dictionary look-up performed
better than an instance-based semantic tagger also
suggests that coarse polysemy (different senses that

5 Conclusions
Our research combined three diverse methods
for semantic lexicon induction in a bootstrapped
ensemble-based framework, including a novel ap-
proach for lexicon induction based on coreference
chains. Our ensemble-based approach performed
better than the individual methods, in terms of
both dictionary accuracy and instance-based seman-
tic tagging. In future work, we believe this ap-
proach could be enhanced further by adding new
types of techniques to the ensemble and by investi-
