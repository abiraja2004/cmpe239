1 Introduction 
This paper presents an overview of the GBGen system, a sentence realizer currently developped 
for French. The system is strictly deterministic, .e. it maps semantic structures to surface forms 
without either simulating parallelism or using backtracking, and the performances are accordingly 
extremely satisfying. It is procedural, based on Government & Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981): 
several levels of syntactic representation are defined, on which configurational searches and trans- 
formations apply. 
GBGen is large-scale, based on a lexicon of approximately 185.000 entries (more or less 24.000 
lexemes together with inflected word forms). The system covers simple and complex sentences, 
complex grammatical phenomena like unbounded ependencies, raising and control structures, 
intrasentential coreference, cliticization , modifiers (both clausal and prepositional) and main cases 
of coordination. It also computes Several morphosyntactic phenomena hke agreement, contractions 
or pronoun lexicalization. In what follows, we present he general characteristics of the software 
and detailits majors components. 
2: Overview of the system 
Two main components form the GBGen system. The pseudo-semantic component, which defines the 
semantic input of the generation process and the syntactic omponent, which produces a sentence 
(in written or spoken format) from the pseudo-semantic specifications. We describe the main 
aspects of these components in the following sections. 
? 2 .1  Pseudo-semant ics  
The input of the generation process is dubbed Pseudo-Semantics. A pseudo-semantic structure 
(PSS) contains both lexical and abstract information (whence the term pseudo). A PSS can be one 
of the following four semantic objects: CLS, DPS, SLS and CHS. 
CLSs (clause structures) represent events and states. They contain a predicate (usually a verb 
or an adjective), functional information such as Tense and Aspect, ? and other PSS objects that 
participate in the interpretation f the CLS (e.g., elements bearing the thematic roles assigned by 
the predicate, etc.). DPSs (DP structures) semantically characterize noun phrases. They consist

of a nominal Property along with a semantic Operator, phi-features, and a referential index used 
for Binding resolution. SLSs (Semantic Label Structures) consist of a semantic label/function and 
an associated PSS. Roughly, these objects are used to characterize thematic-role bearing elements, 
modifiers, or the semantic function of adverbs and adjectives. Finally, CHSs (Characteristic Struc- 
tures) are used to represent adjectives and adverbs. All these elements can be combined to obtain 
the desired semantic representation, but can also be used autonomously (a useful characteristic for 
the use of pseudo-semantics for machine translation). 
As an illustration, the (slightly simplified) PSS for the sentence (la) is (lb): 
(1)a. A big dog was probably killed in this bed 
b. PSS\[

Let us briefly detail the components of the above PSS. The main object is a CLS with the pred- 
icate kill. Tense is represented through a modified version of Reichenbach's analysis (\[Reichenbach 
47\]), where E is the event time point and S the speech time point, the two points being either 
equal or ordered with a precedence r lation. Combining Tense with non-lexical aspect (progressive, 
perfective) leads to verbal tenses. The other functional information states that the sentence to be 
generated is a declarative, positive and passiveone. The other elements that form part of the event 
are (unorderly)'listed in the Satellites list. The first one is an SLS with a thematic role Theme and 
a DPS bearing this role. The DPS has a lexical Property dog and an Operator some_ individual 
(the interpretation ofDPSs follows the generalized quantifiers analysis, see \[Barwise & Cooper 81\]). 
A CHS appears in the Satellite list of the DPS, restricting the set denotation of the property. The 
second SLS in the above representation contains a semantic label Eval truth and an "adverbial" 
CHS. The label states that the semantic function of the CHS is an evaluation of the truth of the 
statement expressed in the CLS. Finally, a spatial SLS is present in the Satellite list, with a spatial 
label In and a DPS with a lexical Property bed and an Operator demonstrative.

Notice, to conclude this section, that the PSSs are not syntactic in nature. They are unordered, 
closed class elements are abstractly represented, and recursiveness in these structures represents 
no more than minimal semantic scope. Hence, the efficiency of the System does not come from the 
? :fact that the input contains yntactic information, but rather from the way syntactic realization is
done. 
2.2 Syntactic Component 
The syntactic processing has three main steps. First, we map the pseudo-semantic information into 
a D-structure. This is achieved by the projection subcomponent. Briefly, each ?element of the PSS 
which has a categorial feature (X=V,N,...) is mapped into a local tree, as in (2): 
XP 
(Maximal ?Projection) 
. Spec(ifier) X Compl(ement) 
(Head) 
The Head/Projection distinction should be seen as a convenient presentational device. Actually, 
a Projection is a record of the properties of the lexical item. Thus, combination of XPs to create 
bigger structures can be done by using properties of heads (e.g., subcategorization). Spec and 
Compl are ordered lists which serve to combine all the subtrees created in the projection component, 
according to the properties of the subtrees. To give a concrete xample, assuming the PSS in (lb), 
the system creates the D-structure in (3): 
(3) \[ cP \[ TP {past} \[ vP \[ AdvP probably\] \[ v kill (perf.; passive) \] \[ DP a \[ NP \[ AdjP big\] 
dog\] \] \[AdvP \[Plain \[Dpthis \ [Npbed\ ] \ ] \ ]  \  \ \]\] 
CP is the top node of each sentence ? and always takes a TP as its complement, which contains 
tense information and the subject of the clause in most cases (in the example, a passive sentence, 
the subject is omitted). VP contains the verb, so-called VP-adverbs in its Spec list, and comple- 
ments/adjunct s in its Compl list. In our example, the latter list contains the theme noun phrase 
and an adjunct (marked with an AdvP), which is the prepositional phrase in this bed. Nous phrases 
are formed with an NP, which contains the noun, its complements and adjectives, and a DP, the 
projection Of determiners, which subcategorizes for NPs. 
Movement and Binding algorithms apply once the D-structure has been created. They merely 
consist in searches in the tree and the movement operation is the generic Move a instruction, 
familiar to GB practici0ners. In this respect, syntactic processing in the system is configurational. 
Going back to our example, the object? of the passive verbal form is moved to the first (Spec of) 
TP with finite T, leaving a coindexed empty category, and the obtained S-structure is the following 
one:  , 
(4) \[ cP \[ TP \[ DP, a \[ m~ \[ AdjP big\] dog\] \] {past} \[ vP \[ AdvP probably\] kill (perf.; passive) \[ DPI 
e\] \[ AdvP \[ PP in \[ DP this \[ NP bed\] \] \] \] \] \] \] 
Finally, we apply the morphological procedure, which computes agreement, selects the cor- 
rect verbal inflected forms, and treats other phenomena like determiner contraction or pronoun 
lexicalization. In our simple example, we would obtain the final sentence in (al).

3 Concluding Remarks 
GBGen is written in Modula-2, developed under Open VMS on a DEC-Alpha system, and also 
runs on PC-Windows. The system is being used (or will be used in the near future) in the following 
systems/projects: 
? ITS3 - a multilingual machine translation system \[Etcheg0Yhen g~ Wehrli 98\]. This system 
uses the IPS parser (\[Wehrli 92\]) to parse English, French, German or ItMian inputs and 
GBGen to generate into the target language. The French-to-French version of the system, 
used as a test tool for GBGen, is available on the web. 1 
? CSTAtt-H speech to speech machine translation project? The aim of the project is to produce 
on line translation of dialogs in the domain of hotel reservation and travel information. GBGen 
takes as input the interlingua developed for the project and produces French spoken output. 
? GENE. This is the interactive version of GBGen, in which the user interactively creates 
pseudo-semantic inputs. The system will soon be part of the SAFRAN project (\[Hamel 
Wehrli 97\], \[ttamel & Vandeventer 98\]), a toomox for computer assisted language learning. 
We presented an overview of GBGen, a large-scale domain-independent syntactic generator. At 
present, the system covers a large part of French grammar artd deals with complex grammatical 
phenomena in a highly efficient way. The system is also strongly generic, which means that its 
extension to other languages hould not require major changes in the procedures. A tentative 
orientation to English generation has shown that the system needs only small parametric variations 
in the procedures to generate major constructions of this language. Given the promising results of 
the approach to surface realization we have choosen, we will pursue the development of the GBGen 
system by extending its grammatical coverage and adding several languages to it.

since not all the relevant information is at present extracted from the parse. Major syntactic constructions are 
nonetheless treated, and the system gives a representative picture of the generator.
