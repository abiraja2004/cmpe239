Abstract 
The paper is the first report on the experimental MT 
system developed as part of the Japanese-Russian 
Automatic tra.aslation Project (JaRAP). The sys- 
tem follows the transfer approach to MT. Limited so 
far to lexico-morphologieal processing, it is seen as 
a foundation for more ambitious linguistic research. 
The system is implemented on IBM PC, MS DOS, 
in Arity Prolog (analysis and transfer) and Turbo 
Pascal (synthesis). 
1 Theoretical  background 
The development of the Jall.AP experimental sys- 
tem was preceded by a long period of purely 
theoretic research into various aspects of natu- 
ral language ~'td its functioning in translatio~t 
(see, e.g., (Shalyaplna~lO80a,1980b,1988)). Some of 
the basic principles which have evolved from this re- 
search may be summarized ~m follows. 
(1) The most adequate scheme for simulating hu- 
man translation ~ctlvity is doubtless the transfer one. 
(2) The level of transfer and the volume of struc- 
tural and semantic information explicitly represented 
at this level should be determined experimentally as
a compromise between the demands for translation 
adequacy under the given conditions and the advan- 
tages of "shortcuts" permitted by the superficial cor- 
respondences between the languages concerned. 
(3) Semantics is not in itself a level of linguistic 
representation, but rather part of linguistic descrip- 
tion at any level of representation f linguistic units. 
(4) In its semantic aspects, syntax is dependent on 
lexicon to a greater extent han vice versa. 
(5) A model aimed at faithful simulation of lin- 
guistic performance should make explicit use of the 
factor of linguistic normativity, this being, at least in 
prospect~ a building block for "self-tuning" functions 
as an analogue for human learning capabilities. 
An approach best suited for effectuating these 
principles eeirm to be that of relying on a lexicon- 
oriented lingware framework of a special kind. 
Within this framework, eTttrles of a uIfiform struc- 
ture may be provided, besides lexlcal units, also for 
morphological categories, fanctlon elements (inchd- 
lug punctuation), and all kinds of grammatical fea- 
tures, while syntagmatics of all levels may be pre- 
sented in terms of valencies of those levels, assigned 
to the corresponding lexical or grasmn.atlca\] units in 
their entries. 
The JaFtAP experimental system is meaatt o in- 
corporate this approach. 
In ~cordance with the transfer scheme of transla- 
tion, the system is made up of three major com- 
ponents: the Japanese analysis component, the 
Japanesc-Rl~ssian transfer component, and the Rus- 
sian synthesis (generation) component. It is imple- 
mented on IBM PC, MS DOS, its programming tools 
being Arity Prolog for analysis and traamfer~ and 
Turbo Pascal for synthesis. 
2 The current version of the 
JaRAP system 
At present, the JaRAP system does not go far beyond 
the i~fitial exico-morphological level of text process- 
ing (though some provision has already been made 
for further stages of its development - see See.3). 
The analysis component of the system performs 
so far three main groups of operations: segmen- 
tation of the input Japanese texts into graphico- 
morphological (CAM-) elements (stems aJtd suffixes 
of Japanese words); processing s\] tranMationally id- 
iomatic (TI-) csm6inatisns of GM-elements; and 
lezieo-rnsrpholofical (LM-) analy~i.? of the resulting 
sequence of (\]M-elements aatd the_Jr TLeomblnations. 
Segmentat ion is accomplished in two steps. 
First, the input text (= the input sequence of k~na 
and kanjl kodes) is broken up into fragments by con- 
teztual delimiters eertMn to denote word or morph 
boundaries (e.g., punctuation marks, the occurrence 
of a k~tat~na symbol after a hlragana one or vice 
verB% etc,). Then the fragmgnts obtained are seg- 
mented into GM-elements by mea~ts of dictionary 
1/2 
search. The resulting GM-elements are represented 
by the reference numbers loc~tlng their dictionary 
entries in the database used. For segmentatimtally 
ambiguous fragments, all possible segmentations are 
formed. If dictionary search is unsuccessful, the pro- 
gram draws oa ant auxiliary index of separate graphic 
symbols, so that "unknown" words can still be pro- 
cessed (nard if they axe composed of "kaatjl, be even 
provided later on with a traatslatlon of sorts). 
The processing of TI combinations of GM- 
dements is partly necessitated by the fact that frag- 
ment boundaa'ies may sometimes epszate the com- 
ponents of a. eornpottnd word~ llke 
so that these compoitents have then to be joined to- 
gether by a special procedure. The saane procedure is 
used to locate multl-word comblaatloits similar to tin- 
gle GM-elements in that they have idioms.tic trans- 
latlons ~nd do not allow of variations in their htter- 
nal structure (this is often he case with terminologi- 
cal expressions). TI-combint~tlons axe searched for as 
sequences of reference numbers identifying the GM- 
elements they ~e composed of. When. found, they 
are replaced each by a single reference number - thu.t 
of the entry for the TI-combinatlon as a whole, ~.nd 
are subsequently treated in the sumac way as individ- 
ual GM-elements (with some reservations mentioned 
in See.3). 
LM-analys ls  of a sequence of GM-elements ex- 
amines, for eazh of them, all of its alterna.tive l xico- 
morphological interpretations, or LM-elements con- 
tanned in its entry, with the aim of integnging the 
LM-elements corresponding to adjacent GM-elements 
into accepta.ble morphologtlcsl (M-) representations 
of Japnmese word-forms. The acceptzdfillty of these 
is established by checldng each M-representa-tion, as
somt as it is formed, for the co-occurrmtce restrk:- 
tions its elements may impose on eax:h other t~nd 
oft the elements of its immediate oittextual neigh- 
bours. Tlfis also serves for disaznbiguation, as all the 
LM-elements that cannot be used to form a.n accept- 
able M-represent~rtion f a word-form in the given 
sequence of GM-elements, are filtered out. 
To optimize processing where aiterna.tive pa.ths of 
analysis are concerited, all analysis procedure, a.re 
orga.nlzed so  as to lhnit sep~r~tte processing of such 
alternatives only to the subpatht; responsible for the 
ditferences between them. If some subp,~th is the 
same in two or more of the alternative axtalyses, it i~ 
processed just once, and the result is used for all the 
corresponding Mteraatives. 
The bulk of the morpho log lea l  deser lpt lon sed 
in LM-analysis is of a valeney-~ased type (an excep- 
tioa being the morphonologica\] - or, r~ther~ morpho- 
graphical - alternations: t.he 10 metarnles represent- 
ing such altentations are incorpor~Lted in the segmen- 
tation procedure). The morphological valencies are 
mostly assigned to suffixes, while stems (verbal or axL 
jecfival) ~t  as fillers. The co-occurrence r strictions 
imposed by the eh'.ments of ~ word-forra on those of 
its adjax:ent word-forms are described in much. the 
same way (the only difference bei\]tg that irt this ca~e 
the data. to be checked is assigned to stems at least 
~L8 often as to sufi'ixes). This helps to mt~ke word- 
bonnda.ries tra-nspa.rent, if necessa-ry, to morpholog- 
ical valencies, so that the borderline between mor- 
phology a.nd syntax loses something of its tradltlona\] 
r~ghtity.

meat, from the positions they initially occur in to 
tkeir appropriate word-forms. Sometimes this in- 
volves skipping a. uumber of intermediate lements, 
such as a.uxilia.rles, brackets, etc. 
Besides lexieo-morphological transfer, we ha.re 
by now implemented some very simple synts.cfieal 
a.n~ysis-and-trv.nsfer opers.tions based on the most 
general correspondences betwemt Japanese and Run- 
sian structura.l and word-order information. This is 
oitly the very first step to the synta~ctlea\] tr~itsfer 
component we are planning, but the operttt\]ons im- 
plemented ~re already suttleient o provide a,tcquate 
l:tusslan translations for Japanese sentences contain-

difficult linguistic phenomenu.

The in format ion  database  used in the analysis 
and transfer procedures is organi~,ed as an indexed 
llst of dictlon~ry entries for individual GM-elements, 
TI-comblnations of GM-elernents, and grammatical 
features ((:lasses) of LM-elements. To speed up (lle- 
113 
tionary search~ the database is provided with ~n in- 
dex organized as a superposition of b~lanced trees. 
Ewch entry (presented in the database by ~ Pro- 
log term) constitutes a list of entry zones confined 
e~ch to one type of linguistic information. A sep- 
axate zone (identified by the corresponding label) 
is used to specify, e.g., the graphical representation 
of the GM-element described, its structural (lexico- 
morphological) representation; the llst of its gram- 
matical maxkers; each type of restrictions imposed 
on the elements filling its morphological w, deneles, 
etc. The overall set of entry zones is the same for all 
types of entries, though e~ch entry cont~ns only the 
zones relevant o the element described. 
At present, the d~tabase includes over two thou- 
sand entries. 
Special emphasis has been placed upon providing 
the system with e~cient means of updating linguis- 
tic information. The environment built for this pur- 
pose is called VOCOPS ("VOCabulary updating OP- 
tionS"). 
The VOCOPS environment allows the user to 
add, delete or replace all types of dlction~ry entries 
or zones within them in a highly interactive mode. 
VOCOPS checks the updating information for its for- 
real accuracy and for its compatibility with the in- 
formation already contained in the current databa.se. 
It then proceeds to waxn the user of those con- 
sequence~ of lds updating operations which other- 
wise might have been overlooked, and to indicate 
the in~cur~ies or inconsistencies detected. If pos- 
sible, it also suggests the likely ways of their cor- 
rection. Among other things, VOCOPS keeps watch 
on the correspondence b tween the entries for indi- 
vidual GM- (and LM-) elements ~d those for their 
TI-combinatlons. E.g., if the user wishes to delete 
a GM-element which forms pazt of some of the TI- 
combinations present in the database, VOCOPS lists 
these with a warning that they will also be deleted. 
The Russian synthesis component is co~l- 
strutted as an independent subsystem, cornplete with 
a database of its own. Its functions include both mor- 
phological generation and some tmpecta of syntactic 
processing. Here we will not discuss it an any length, 
because there is ~ sepaxate paper devoted entirely to 
this component (Kanovich,ShaJyapintr,199.1). 
3 Development  work under 
way 
Implementing the most basic (however simple) of the 
linguistic functions needed in translatior h the current 
version of the Jal'tAP system constitutes the neces- 
sary foundation for further developments. Both its 
database and its programming software are struc- 
tured to a~cept any new components (new zones of 
) 
4 
the dictionary entries, new progra.ms, tetc) without 
impairing ~.hose ~Iready functioning..'\]:he VOCOPS 
updating subsystem is also general enough to be e~- 
ily tuned up to new types of linguistic d~t~ as soon 
as they are included in the system. 
Moreover, even in its present form, the JM~.AP sys- 
tem comprises ome specific features mea~tt for more 
adwnced lingulstic processing. 
Thus, aznong the grammatical markers assigned to 
the Japanese LM-elements in the current database 
axe u number of those to be used in syntactical nal- 
ysis. 
Entries for TI-comblnations of GM-elements in- 
clude specification of their syntactically ~d seman- 
tically dominant components, for use in processing 
paxallel constructions and a~taphor~. 
The list of the Russian equivalents for an LM- 
element includes, wherever desirable, different parts 
of speech, the choice between them to be effected by 
the syntactical tra~tsfer. 
The synthesis component is designed to ~cept 
syntactic',dly weighted representations of Russian 
word-forms, etc, 
Now that we have built the ba.qic groundwork, 
labor-consuming as it is, we are taking up these, more 
ambitious tasks. 
As the Japanese-Russlan pa~r of languages i vir- 
tually unexplored in its machine-tra~tslation perspec- 
tive, our immediate off'errs are being focussed on de- 
termining the reasonable minimum of grazmnatical 
knowledge of Japanese necessary for obtaining intel- 
ligible Russian output for unadapted (us-pro-edited) 
Japanese input.
