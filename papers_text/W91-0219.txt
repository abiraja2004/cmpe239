Summary 
The meth(xJology of development of the Concept Dictionary being compiled by EDR, which is to be a neutral dictionary 
for semantic processing of natural languages available for various application systems, is described. The Concept Dictionary is 
based on several linguistic semantic representation theories and consists of : a) concept descriptions, and b) the concept taxonomy. 
Moreover, pnfference knowledge is being collected fi'om output data of various testing systems. 
1. Introduction 
A dictionary in which dependencies among 400,000 word senses of the English and Japanese languages are 
described in detail (Concept Dictionary) is being developed by EDR. The goal of the development is o build a 
neutral dictionary for natural anguage semantic processing that is available for various application systems. 
The implementation of the dictionary is based on several linguistic semantic representation theories. 
For a long time, a series of trials for describing dependencies among words or word senses by bundling 
verbs, adjectives, etc., has been conducted. Establishing adeep case level and using a formalism independent 
of each language, Fillmore developed a theory of representation of dependency among words (Fillmore 1968). 
On the other hand, Fodor and Katz explained a mechanism of selecting interpretations of constituents in a 
sentence by using a formalism composed of a semantic marker, distinguisher and selection restriction (Katz 
and Fodor 1963). In contrast to these theories, Wilks proposed a point of view to consider word dependency 
not as a constraint but as a preference (Wilks 1975). In addition, Schank proposed to abstract connotations 
not only from senses of nouns but also those of verbs, and he named them "primitive actions" (Schank 1975). 
These semantic representation theories have been reviewed and used in developing practical natural language 
processing systems (Nagao 1985, etc.). 
As such development of practical natural anguage processing systems progressed, the importance of 
accumulating lexJcal descriptions became recognized by developers of such systems. That is, a dictionary large 
enough in terms of both the granularity of semantic markers and the number of words or word senses became 
necessary tobuild. Against he background of the situation, the development of the Concept Dictionary began 
(Kakizaki 1987, Yokoi et. el. 1989, Uchida, 1990, Miik? et. el. 1990a). The methodology of development of 
206 
the Concept Dictionary, which consists of a) concept descriptions, which represent dependencies among 
concepts and categories, and b) the concept axonomy, which represent super-sub relations among concepts, 
is described in sections 2 and 3. Preference knowledge, which represents preference order of concept 
descriptions, i  explained in section 4. in section 5, spheres of applications and limitations of the dictionary 
arc discussed. 
2. Development of Concept Descriptions 
Concept relations are described at the following three levels: 
a) concept-concept relation descriptions 
b) concept-category relation descriptions 
c) category-category reladon descriptions 
2.1 Concept -concept  Relat ion Descr ip t ions  
We are building an on-line corpus which includes 1,000,000 practical example sentences that are analyzed 
lexically, syntactically and semantically for the most pan manually (EDR corpus). Figure 1 is an example of 
an entry of the corpus. 
Firstly, (a) is the word sense selection (le?ical analysis) section, where a word sense (concept) has been 
selected for each word in the sentence. Secondly, (b) is the syntactic analysis section, where all binding 
relations among words has been analyzed. Finally, (c) is the semantic analysis section, where the semantic 
network representing the meaning of the sentence is decomposed into a set of triplets. These triplets 
correspond to the following concept-concept relation descriptions: 
(I) c#enlarg?--<and>-- c#new 
c#membership ---<object>~ ,#new 
c#bear --<location>'-" c#it 
c#bdng ~<?ause>--, cth'nembership

c#vulnerable ~<modify>-, c#sdll 
c#vulnerable ~<object>'-- c#the_U.N 
c#vulnerabl? ~<modify>-* c#structurally 
As shown above, concept-concept relation descriptions are extracted irectly from the semantic analysis 
secdon (and word sense selection section) in the EDR Corpus. A method of collecting and selecting source 
sentences for the EDR corpus is described in (Nakao 1990a) and a method of extracting concept descriptions 
from the FEDR corpus is explained in detail in (Nakao 1990b). 
Source texts of the EDR corpus are selected so as to diversify as much as possible the concepts in them. 
However, it is impossible to collect all concepts or concept relations from the corpus even if the amount of 
texts is very large. To compensate for the shortage of examples, we also create example sentences and analyze 
them lexically and semantically. Concept-concept relation descriptions are also extracted from ~e sentences,

2.2 Concept-category Relation Descriptions 
If some concept-concept relations share a concept, it is possible to bundle them into a representation. For 
example, concept.concept relation descriptions (2) can be bundled into a concept-category elation description 
(4), if a super-sub relation (3) is also described simultaneously within the concept axonomy. 'This level of 
description corresponds to Fodor and Katz's representation using semantic markers and selection restrictions.

(to break a rule)

(3) (rules)

(4) c#break--<object>-- (rules) 
2.3 Category-category Relation Descriptions 
In the previous section, we discussed the cases in which filler concepts of deep case pattems can be bundled 
into categories, namely concept-category elations. Moreover, frame concepts in deep case patterns can also 
be bundled and represented by categories (frame categories) (Ogino et. al. 1989). For example, the three 
categories O1.2.6, 06.8.2 and C)9.14.4 defined in Figure 2 (Hereafter, the notation "C)" also means a 
category,) bundle concepts and are linked with other categories to describe category-category elations (5), (6) 
and ("7) : 
(5) 01.2.6 --<agent>.>"-'," (Animals) 
01.2.6 --<object.>-- (Physical_Objects) 
O t.2.6 --<implement>--* (Parts_of_Animals) 
(6) 06.8.2 --<agent>-,' (Human_Beings) 
06,8.2 ---<object>'-.,. (Information) : (Things_With_Information) 
06.8.2 --<goal>'-" (Human_Beings} : (Information_Accepters) 
(7) C)9.14.4--<object>-- (Animals) 
This level of descriptions corresponds to Schank's representation using primitive actions, in a sense. For 
example, 06.8.2 includes a connotation that can be represented by MTRANS, which is one of the primitive 
actions, although other frame categories do not always correspond to a primitive action. In addition, relations 
between verbs and adverbs, for example those mentioned in (La.koff 1966), are also described at this level.

3 Development of the Concept Taxonomy 
The two kinds of concept descriptions including categories, narncly concept-category relation descriptions 
and category-category relation descriptions, mentioned in the previous sections, must have their descendant 
concept-concept relations in order to become useful. That is, concepts must be able to be actually classified 
into categories included in such descriptions. 
A concept can generally be classified into more than one categories (multiple classification). However it 
is difficult to make exhaustive multiple classification from the beginning, because in the case of multiple 
classification, we must compare concepts with categories mn times when there are m concepts and n 
categories. In the case of exclusive classification using a distinctive u'e? whose leaves mean categories, on the 
other hand, we must only compare concepts with nodes on the tree Ofrn(log n)) times. Additionally, the 
210 
number of categories which share same sub-concepts with a category (cross categories) is generally much less 
than the number of all categories. Moreover, it is not so difficult to make a list of cross categories for each 
category (cross category list) in advance. 
Considering the points mentioned above, we use the following method for concept classification : 1) 
exclusive classification : selecting categories which hardly share same sub-concepts (exclusive categories), and 
making the first classification using a distinctive tree locating the exclusive categories atits leaf level. 2) cross 
classification : making the second classification i to categories other than exclusive categories, based on cross 
category lists, and building a concept taxonomy from the results of the second classification. 3) improvement 
of the Concept Dictionary : modifying the Concept Dictionary based on the results from tests using various 
testing systems and automatic concept clustering from concept-concept relation descriptions. In the following 
sections 3.1 and 3.2, we explain the first exclusive classification and the second cross classification 
respectively. In section 3.3, we describe amethod for modification of the Concept Dictionary. 
3.1 Exc lus ive  C lass i f i ca t ion  o f  Concepts  
3.1.1 C lass i f i ca t ion  into  MONO-Categor ies  
The first classification into categories for nominal concepts (MONO-concepts) is made by using the 
MONO-concept taxonomy as shown in Figure 3 as a distinctive tree. That is, the classification starts from the 
top node, decends along branches of the tree, and when reaching a node, compares the node's children nodes 
with the input concept. This process is repeated, and if one of the leaves of the tree is reached, the 
MONO-category corresponding to the leave should ~ selected.

(R~oc i~_Pos i I i ons )  
(Races ? Ethnic_Groups) 
(Abs~,bjects) 
Figure 3. the MONO-Concept Taxonomy 
211 
For example, in the case of the concept "c#police_man", when we start with the question, "Is that a 
physical object, a place or an abstract object?" (answer. aphysical object), and pass through the questions, "Is 
that an animate object, a part of the body of an animate object, a natural object, a human artifact or an 
organization?" (answer: an animate object), "Is that a human being, an animal or a plant?" (answer: a human 
being), and "Is that a child, a relative, an occupation ...?" (answer: an occupation), then we can classify the 
concept into the category (Occupations) .
\ 
3.1,2 Classif ication into KOTO-Categor ies  
As mentioned above, the first classification of the MONO-concepts i made by using the MONO-concept 
taxonomy's hierarchy as a distinctive tree. On the other hand, the method for the first classification of verbal 
concepts (KOTO-concepts) is not made by using the hierarchy as a distinctive tree but by semantic association 
from the meanings of the concepts and examples of deap case patterns of the concepts. 
The hierarchy has three levels. The highest level has been divided coarsely based on semantic association 
(coarse semantic lusters; all can be seen in Figure 4). The second level has been also divided based on 
semantic association (fine semantic lusters; all below coarse semantic luster ~ I can be seen in Figure 5). 
On the contrar'y, the third level has been divided based on the deep case pattern shared by concepts 
(KOTO-categories; all below fine semantic luster ? 1.2 can be seen in Figure 6), where one category has 
only one deep case pattern which is specified with its distinctive pattern (expressed with the notation" \[... \] " 
as in Figure 2). We have now 14 coarse semantic lusters, 253 fine semantic clusters and 984 
KOTO-categories in the hierarchy.

Figure 6. KOTO-Categories Below ? i .2 
213 
The first classification of a concept into the KOTO-categories is made based on semantic association with 
the concept and deap case patterns created with the concept. The procedures are as follows: I) ~signing basic 
concepts into KOTO-categories: classifying about 4,000 basic concepts into fine semantic clusters, describing 
deep case patterns underlying example sentences created with the concepts and dividing the clusters into 
KOTO-categories to make each of them have only one deap case pattern. 2) Establishing two indexes :
making a) a word index for retrieving categories by a word, and b) a case frame index for retrieving 
categories by a deep case set. 3) Searching category candidates: a) searching category candidates by 
associating basic concepts which seem to share a deap case pattern with the concept and retrieving the word 
index by words meaning the basic concepts, b) In a case in that it is impossible to associate any basic concepts 
with the concept, finding category candidates by creating example sentences, making deap case frames from 
the sentences, and retrieving the case frame index by the frames to find category candidates. 4) Selecting a
category from the category candidates: classifying concepts into the most appropriate category by considering 
from the following three points of view: a) the names of the categories and their upper clusters, b) the 
distinctive patterns of the categories, and c) the basic concepts assigned to the categories. 
3.2 Cross Classification of Concepts 
Cross classification of concepts i made in the following way: 
l) Making cross category lists for each exclusive categories. Types of cross relations are assorted into 
the following three types: a) a cross category which implies an exclusive category, b) a cross 
category which intersects an exclusive category, and c) a cross category which includes an exclusive 
category. 
2) Contrasting each concept classified into an exclusive categoriy and each cross category listed in the 
cross category list of the exclusive category and judging whether or not the concept can be classified 
into the cross category. Here in the above case c), all concepts in the exclusive category can be 
automatically classified into the cross category. 
3.3 Improvement of the Concept Dictionary 
Through the following procedures, categories which should be modified ate found and improvement of the 
Concept Dictionary is made: 
1) Collecting negative xamples: 
When an answer other than correct answers is output from a testing system, an inappropriate 
concept-concept relation must be found deduced from the Concept Dictionary by viewing a debugging 
~ace of the process of/he system. Such concept-concept relations are collected as negative examples. 
2) Collecting positive xamples: 
When a correct answer is not output from a testing system, a concept-concept relation must be found 
to be added to the Concept Dictionary. Moreover, all correct answers output from all testing systems 
214 
must have their corresponding concept-concept relations deduced from the Concept Dictionary. These 
concept-concept relations are collected as positive xamples. 
3) Estimation: 
At a slage when negative and positive examples have been collected to some extent, the divisibility of 
each concept-category relation description and category-category relation description is estimated by 
using the following formula: 
(8) D ( I ,  m,  n) = "~>~ qt/ 
P(i) 
,lwO 
\[ i V" - i  
I/~m-sJ 
where P(a3 = 
. 
0 .< k ~ 1.0 (a parameter), 
n : the number of concepts under the category, 
i : the number of incorrect classifications into the category, 
m : the number of examples, 
I : the number of negative examples. 
The formula (8) is derived as follows: 
We suppose that the concept-category (or category,.cazegory) relation description (9) is an object of our 
estimation: 
(9) a-  tel " "  B 
that the number of the concepts classified under the camgory B is n: 
( I0 )  B 
bt b2 ..... b, 
and that the number of (both negauve and positive) examples is m and the number of negative examples in the 
examples is h 
( i l )  m examples 
a - -  r:l -- bt 
a - -  ml  ~ b3 
a m tel --" b4 
a m tel ~ b. 
* a - -  tel - -  bz 
* a ~ te l  ---. b5 
((re.l) positive examples) (I negative xamples) 
i f  the number of concepts which are under the category B but not appropriate for the concept description (9) is i, 
215 
the probability that 1 negative examples are found out of m examples is given by the formula (12)".' 
\ ! )~m-/ /  
(12) P(i) = 
Therefore, the probability that the ratio of the concepts not appropriate for the description (9) to the concepts 
located under the category B is more than k is given by the formula (8). Here we use Bayse's Theorem because 
sellections of the number i are events independent from each other. 
4) Deletion of the concept descriptions: 
In cases in that the value of the formula (8) is more than 0.9 when k = 0.9, the concept description 
(9) is deleted from the Concept Dictionary and remaining positive examples are asserted as concept- 
concept relation descriptions into the Concept Dictionary because most of the examples for the 
description are negative. 
5) Division of categories 
In cases in that the value of the formula (8) is more than 0.9 when k = O. I, the category B is divided 
in two in order to represent both a category satisfying the relation (9) and a category not satisfying the 
relation (9) and all concepts under the category B is reclassified into the two categories because we 
recognize that a) the number of examples are large enough for the estimation, and that b) the number of 
negative examples is too large to neglect. Here if the divided two categories exist as sub-categories of 
the category B in the concept taxonomy, the classification is not necessary. 
6) Accumulation of preference knowledge 
In cases in that the value of the formula (8) is not more than 0.9 when k = O. I, the collected negative 
examples are translated to preference knowledge (for data structures and usages of preference 
knowledge, see Section 4). From a debugging trace of a testing system, together with a negative 
example, a concept, a word or a pronumciation corresponding to the negative example and a concept 
description more appropriate than the negative example must be also gained. This information is 
represented by preterence knowdedge with the following format 03) and accumulated: 
(13) on <concept> I <word> I <pronunciation> 
give preference to 
<a-more-appropriate-concept-description> 
over 
<a-negative-example-of-.concept-description> 
. . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  o o . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
( ~., 'r) ~. We ~ay use Poisson distribution asan approximation to (12) if n is large. However. since n~ 3,000, it is realistic to 
calculate the formula (12). 
216 
7) Clustering of concept-concept relation descriptions 
Concept-concept relation descriptions remaining after all the above procedures are clustered by using 
an optimal scaling or using DM-decomposition and a probability-based estimation and the gained 
clusters are asserted as concept-category relation descriptions into the Concept Dictionary. The 
clustering algorithms are explained in detail in (Nakao 1988, Matsukawa 1989). 
8) Reconstruction f the concept taxonomy 
Category-category relation descriptions are clustered and hierachized by using DM-decomposition and 
set-relation calculations in order to bundle the descriptions into higher level categories. The 
hierachization algorithm is explained in detail in (Matsukawa 1990a, 1990b, Yokola 1990). 
4 Preference Knowledge 
All concepts, categories and concept descriptions have an ID number called concept ID. Knowledge for 
ordering input ,sentence interpretations given by using the Concept Dictionary are represented by data 
individually expressing the order of the concept \[Ds that co-occur with each word pronunciation, word and 
concept, respectively (preference knowledge). We use the following three methods for ordering concept IDs: 
a) Linear lists of concept IDs 
b) Association lists of concept IDs and the concept IDs' preference value 
c) Dbected graphs including arcs meaning preference relations between concept \[Ds 
As mentioned in section 3.3, modification of the Concept Dictionary is made based on feedback 
information from tests performed by various kinds of processes in application systems (testing systems). 
Word sense selection and translation word candidates election are ones of these processes. 'When an output 
answer given by such a testing system is different from correct answers, the reason for the difference is 
analyzod by viewing u'aces of processes of the system, and the Concept Dictionary and/or the preference 
knowledge ate/is modified. After such modifications, the correct answers become able to be selected by using 
the Concept Dictionary and the preference knowledge. For example, the word "suspend" has five senses, as 
shown in Figure 7. If the concept-concept relation shown in (14) is input, only two out of the five senses 
match the relation. The two senses are shown in (15): 
(14) c#suspend --<object>'-" c#police_man 
(to suspend the policeman) 
(15) 04.2.2 --<object>~ c#police_man

Figure 7. The Five Senses of Word "suspend" and Their Concept Descriptions 
If we have preference knowledge on "c#police_man" as shown in (I 6), we can select only one sense out of 
the two senses, namely "c#(0dbT0c)to_prevent_from_taking_part_in_a_team_for_a-time." 
(16) on c#1x)lice_man 
give preference to 
04..2.2 --<object>~ (Human_Beings) ; 
over 
O1.2.5 --<object>--" (Physical Objects) ; 
Moreover, such preference knowledge is given to each concept, word or pronunciation. For example, 
"c#bird" and "c#rabbit" have different preference knowledge as follows: 
218 
(17) on 
give preference to 
cMly --<agmat>-" (intentional-Objects) ;
over 
c~hop --<agent>-" (Animals) : 
o n c#rabbit 
give preference to  
c~hop - -<agent>""  (An ima ls )  ; 
over 
c~tly --<agent>'-,' (IntcndonaJ-Objects) : 
By using this knowledge with the concept descriptions shown in Figure 8, Japanese sentences can be 
properly translated, for example as shown in (18) (for a method for unification of concepts expressed by 
different words or in different languages, ee (Miike 1990b, Tominaga 1991)): 
(18) a) TORt  - GA 
(abe)  
TOBU. ~ . A bird flies. 
b) USAOI  - OA TOBU.  ? A rabbit hops. 
(a rabbit) 
Preference knowledge is collected not only through processings of word sense selection and translation 
word candidate selection, but also throiagh those of structual disambiguation, paraphrasing and the like. 
Therefore, the knowledge includes descriptions corresponding to lexical preference proposed by Ford, 
Bresnan and Kaplan for structual disambiguation (Ford Bresnan and Kaplan 1982). Although such knowledge 
provides just a bias of interpretations of ambiguous tructures, the knowledge is indispensable for 
deterministic sentence analysis without any knowledge about the discourse to be refered in order to use the 
principle of parsimony, the principle of a priori plausibility, etc. (Crain and Steedman 1984, Hirst 1984). 
5 Discussion 
Concept-category relations are similar to what are called selection restrictions. However, the goal of the 
development of the Concept Dictionary is not to express word sense with minimum semantic markers uch as 
in (Katz and Fodor 1963). What is important is to actualize a methodology for weeding out incorrect, too 
coarse or useless concept descriptions by using them on various application systems. For the purpose, we 
may have redundant semantic markers (namely, categories) at the first stage and do have descriptions not 
including semantic markers (namely, concept-concept relation descriptions).

We are compiling and improving the Concept Dictionary based on the results of many practical tests 
performed by various application systems. Actually, however, the number of the application systems we arc 
using for testing dictionary data is only some dozen, and the functions we require the dictionary to fulfill are 
just at the level of practical necessity for the systems. In other words, compared with "the whole knowledge", 
the Concept Dictionary actually lacks various parts. For example: 
1) Coverage of Concept Relations and Categories: 
a) Coverage of concept relations: 
The number of sentences in the EDR corpus is 1,000,000. As mentioned above, we also 
create example sentences for some concepts and we use categories to describe concept relations. 
However, the coverage of concept relations is incomplete. The situation is similar to that of 
ordinary lexicography in that even if we had a very large corpus and aboundant lexicographers, 
they could never completely assign example sentences covering all kinds of word co- 
occurrences in all types of contexts 
b) Coverage of categories: 
Some categories are useful to describe concept relations, while other categories are not. Since 
the Cost/performance of the implementation f useless categories i low, we do not implement 
such categories in the concept taxonomy. 
2) Granularity of Concepts 
Since concepts, our representation primitives, are almost as fine as translation words' senses in 
bilingual dictionaries, it is impossible to implement knowledge including finer instances. 
a) Real world instances : 
From concept-concept relations, we can extract slots of a class in the real world. For example, 
from the concept-concept relation shown in (19), we can extract slot "haveALid?" of class 
"C#vessel" as shown in (20): 
(19) c#vessel --,cpart_of> u c#lid 
(20) C#vessel 
canHaveSI0ts: (haveALid?) 
film we use the notation Cyc uses (Lenat and Ouha 1989)) 
However, we cannot extract some attributes of real world instances from concept relation 
descriptions. For example the value "yes" of the slot "have ALid?" shown at (21) can never be 
decided with the Concept Dictionary: 
(21) TheVesselOnTheDesklnFronlOfMeAtl :OOamOnMarch3rdln 199 IJST 
instanceOf: C#vessel 
haveALid?: yes 
221 
b) Distinction of pragmatic referents: 
Finer referents are used for describing pragmatic ambiguities of a sentence. For example, in 
order to express pragmatically different interpretations, different referents ate described into 
each mental space, according to Fauconnier's theory (Fauconnier 1984). For example, 
different interpretations of the sentence (22) require at least three different mental spaces and 
six different referents of the word "president". 
(22) John believes that the president was a baby in 1929. 
The Concept Dictionary can not give distinction of such referents although it can give predicate 
concepts used in annotations for mental spaces.
