3. THE SOLACE 
As  a shor tcut  towards  a lex icon  o f  
reasonab le  coverage  we dec ided  to  
build upon an available machine 
readable dictionary, which we intend 
to augment later by hand and from 
other sources. Our primary source of 
English lexical data is now CUVOALD, 
or  the Expanded Computer Usable 
Version of the Oxford Advanced 
Learner's Dictionary of  Cul.rent 
English, 3rd edition (OALD, Hornby, 
1974), w}Kch is available from Oxford 
Text Archive (see Mitten, 1986) 4 . 
CUVOALDIists all headwords, headword 
variants and derivatives with simple 
codes denoting word classes and 
inflection patterns, supplemented by 
verb pattern codes for verbs. Sense 
distinctions from OALD are not 
retained. 
Where~q the  der ivat ion  o f  lex ica l  
in fo rmat ion  as  needed by  the  ana lys i s  
f rom CUVOALD word  c lass  codes  is  
re la t ive ly  s t ra ight fo rward ,  the  OALD 
verb  pat tern  codes ,  wh ich  are  c ruc ia l  
for our purpose, present a real 
challenge. The dictionary classifies 
verbs according to the number and form 
of complements in%~ 51 "verb 
pat terns" ,  marked  by  numbers  1-25 ,  
supplemented in some cases by letters 
(4A,4B,4C,4D,4F). The number of verbs 
in a single pattern is quite variable: 
starting from a single item in \[VP4F\] 
for he followed by an infinitive up to 
4855 standard transitive verbs in 
\[VP6A\]. A pattern groups together 
verbs which exhibit the same behaviour 
in a standard context and are subject 
to the same set of transfor~tions 
under  spec i f ied  cond i t ions .  So  e.g .  
the  c lass  o f  in t rans i t ive  verbs  
\[ VP2A\ ]  can  take  in t roductory  there  and  
postpone the subject if it is 
indefinite and "heavy" : There comes 
a time when we feel we must make 
a protest. A single pattern is also 
used for verbs which allow the same 
mot phesyntactic variations of 
a complement. ( \[VPI\] : She's dark~in 
good heal th/here/a pretty girl. ) 
A different verb pattern is, however, 
used if only a subset of the relevant 
class perndLs  the variation. ( \ [VP6C\] :  
She en~oys swimmir~g / * to  swim. vs. 
\[VP6D\] : She likes swim~ting / to swim.) 
Some vat  ia t io~kq may be t reated  as  
a d i f fe rent  verb  pat tern .  (Th is  is  the  
case  o f  the  above  example :  She l i kes  
swimming. \[VP6D| and Site l ikes to 
swim. \[VPTA\] ) 
Akkerman (1989)  l i s t s  severa l  
shor tcomings  of  the  OALD verb  
pat terns .  As  Sampson (1990)  noted ,  
some o f  them are  arguab le .  For  our  
purpose ,  the  most  prob le ,~t ic  seems to  
be  the  t reatment  o f  compound verbs  
( with the resulting loss of 
infor.~tion in CUVOALD) and too 
surface-level definition of some verb 
patterns. These classes are quite 
a heterogenous collection: by \[VPI4\] 
are  marked  verbs  in  a l l  o f  the 
following uses ,  the  on ly  requ i rement  
be ing  that  the  verb  i s  fo l lowed by  
a noun and  a prepos i t iona l  phrase :  
They accused him of  steal ing the book. 
I explained my diff iculty to him. 
Compare the copy with the original. 
Another  "misbehaved"  pat tern  is  VP4A 
where ,  depend ing  on  the  verb ,  the  
infinitive can be complement or 
adjunct: 
The ~winm~er failed to reach the shore. 
lie came to see that he was mistaken. 
She stood up to see better. 
Apar t  f rom these  "sys temic"  b lemishes  
we expect  a number  o f  o ther  
incons is tenc ies  and  er rors  to  appear  
dur ing  t}~ process  o f  der ivat ion  and

The target lexicon conta: imq the

The sa,~ could \[~ expressed in a 
PATR-Iike style (Shieber (1986) ) :

< S\[; SUBJ  > = < SC f irst  > 
< US C/J)V > = s leep 
< US AC'F > = < ~7 f irst US > 
Next, we Rive two possible comple- 
mentation paradigms for a transitive 
verb. ( PAT stands for patient, 
VI prespart,  SC<N3 > \] 4 is abbreviation 
for present participle form of a verb 
whose single va/ency slot for subject 
in the SC list is co-indexed with the 
~ct~r/bearer of the n~trJx verb): 
SC < I1 \ ]  N \ [nomla  , 121 N\ [acc \ ]4  > , 
SF \[ s \ [~u 111 , OBJ \[21 I , 
US \[ C<)V en joy  , ACt 131 , PAT \ [4 \ ]  \] 
SC < \[I\] N\[nom\]a , 
\[2\] V\[prespart ,SC<N3>\]4 > , 
SF \[ S\[~J \[i\] , ()IkJ \[2\] \] , 
US \[ GOV enjoy , AUI' \ [3 \ ]  , PAT \[4\] \] 
&q the value of the attribute PAT 
of er~joy i.s shared with the value of 
the attribute US of the object, the 
correct va\]ue for the dependent 
verb's ACt attribute is supp\] led via 
co-indexing of the subject of enjoy 
wJ th the subject of the non- finite 
clause within the SC list of er~joy: 
US \[ GOV en joy  , ACt' \ [31  , 
PAT \[ GOV swim , AC? \ [3 \ ]  \] \] 
The complementation paradigm, 
rat}mr tI~n being stated within 
full-fledged feature structures, is 
expressed in terms of templates, 
pre fer rab \ ]  y a l low ing  defau l ts  and  
mul t ip le  inher i tance ,  Accord ing ly ,  the  
above  two parad ig~ wi l \ ]  be expressed  
as follows :

transi tive 
transitive , 2ing , equi 
Two verbal entries can he related 
by a lexical rule with the effect that 
one of these two entries need not be 
explicitly present (the ot}~er should 
then be ~rked  by the rule's name). 
This will solve phenomena such as 
there preposir~, dative alternation, 
and passivization. 
The collection of three "levels" of 
description within a single comple- 
mentation paradigm provides a means to 
express rather subtle differences. Let 
us take as an example four superfi- 
cially identical constructions: 
(a) I w~nted him to see the monster. 
(b) I expected him to see the monster. 
(c) I elected him to see the monster. 
(d) I told him to see the monster. 
Following Quirk et al (1985, 
p.1216), the verb is monotransitive in 
(a) ,  complex-transitive in (b) and 
(c), and ditransitive in (d). The 
example (b) is closer to the mono- 
transitive type while (c) is closer to 
the ditransitive type. 
If we have the subcategorization list 
SC < \[1\] N\[nom\]4 , \[2\] N\[acc\ ]5  , 
\[3\] V\[inf, SC<Ns>\]6 > 
to express the superficial identity of 
all the four cases, we can assume the 
above verbs to have the following 
syntactic frames: 
(a) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJ\[3\]\] 
(b) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJI2\], OBJCOMPL\[3\]\] 
(c) SF \[SUBJ\[1\], OBJ\[2\], OBJCOMPL\[3\]\] 
(d) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJ\[3\], OBJ212\]\] 
The difference between the types (a) 
and (b) vs. (c) and (d) is that 
between the Raising and Equi types. 
Therefore, (b) will have only two 
participants at the level of under- 
ly ing structure while (c) will have 
three: 
(a) US \[ACr 14\], PAT \[6\]\] 
(b) US \[ACT \[4\] ,  PAT \[6\]\] 
(c) US \[ACT \[4\],  PAT \[5\] ,  EFF \[6\]\] 
(d) US \[ACT \[4\],  PAT \[6\] ,  ADDR \[5\]\] 
The respective templates will be: 
(a) transitive, 3inf , raising 
(b) complex-transitive, 3inf , raisin~ 
(c) complex-transitive, 3inf , equi 
(d} di trensi tive, 3inf , equi 
A problem remains bow to derive 
such information from OAL/T s verb 
patterns. 
5. THE DE}{IVATION 
CUVOALD was not pri.~rily intended 
for use with a syntactic parser, so a 
few modifications were necessary. 
First, the pronunciation field was 
deleted and homograph entries with 
different pronunciations r~erged. ( In 
CUVOALD, each word, or word form, has 
only one entry, unless it has two 
different pronunciations. ) Second, 
entries headed by regular forms within 
i r regu lar  parad igms as  headwords  were  
a l so  de le ted .  And  f ina l ly ,  re ference  
to  base  fo rms was  prov ided  in  ent r ies  
o f  a l l  the  remain ing  nonbase  ( i r regu-  
la r )  fo rms.  Base  fo rms o f  i r regu lar  
parad igms were  marked  by  a code  spec i -  
fy ing  the  parad igm type .  A f te r  that ,  
we  t r ied  to  f ind  a way  how to  der ive  
the  complementat ion  parad igms.  
Idea l ly ,  templates  o f the  sor t  
descr ibed  in  Sect ion  4 shou ld  Cor res -

ca l  ru les  wou ld  account  fo r  s t ructures

idea  works  in  t}~e case  o f  the  most  
f requent  pat terns  ( \ [VP2A\ ]  , \ [VP6A\ ]  ) , 
there  are  many pat terns  where  the  
re la t ion  between pat tern  and  parad igm 
can  be  l :n ,  n : l ,  o r  even  n :n  (n  > I) 
(see Section 3). 
The case of n patterns : i paradigm 
reduces  the  number  o f  parad igms and as  
such  i s  a we lcome s i tuat ion .  The  case  
o f  1:n  can  mean (i) ambigu i ty  fo r  a l l

used valency codes in Ii)0CE (Lon~gnan 
Dictior~ary of Contemporary English) to 
autematical\]y extract the (explicitly 
unmarked) distinction between Equi and 
Raising verbs. Similar approach can be 
tNed to ,~ke this and other distinc- 
tions in OALD by taking into account 
co-occurences of verb pat terra. (Am

of verbs, for which any pessibilJty of

tion of lexica\] values of particles 
and prepositions for compound verbs 
and ass ign ing  verbs  n~rked by  verb  
pat tern  codes  such  m~ VP14 to  re levant  
subclasses. 
The correspondences between the 
OALD patterns and complementation 
paradigms are stated in the simple 
cases  by ru les  re la t ing  one or  more  
pat terns  to  one  or  more  parad igms 
- templates. Where possible, 
frequently co-occurring verb patterns 
are collapsed into a single paradigm 
with local disjuction, e.g. \[VP61)\] and 
\[VPTA\] for like (swimming/ to swim) 
give the following template: 
\[ transitive, { 2ing / 2inf }, equi \], 
which expands into: 
SC < \[I\] N \ [nomb , 
\[ 21 V\[{prespartl inf} ,SC<N3>\]4 > , 
SF \[ suB J  \[11 , OBJ lZ l  \] , 
US \[ GOV l i ke  , ACI' \[3\] , PAT \[4\]  \] 
Now t~re  are two possible strat- 
egies representing two extremes. The 
f i r s t  s t ra tegy  d is regards  the  actua l  
d i s t r ibut ion  o f  verb  pat terns  in  the  
d ic t ionary  and  at ten~ts  to  combine  
resu l ts  o f  ru le  app l i ca t ion  in to  
a compact and meaningful complementa- 
Lion paradigm. The second strategy 
starts from a list of all combinations 
of verb patterns within the dictionary 
and assigns a rule to every combina- 
tion. Let us look }mw the first 
approach  works .  
The process  o f  der ivat ion  o f  a com-  
p lementat ion  parad igm for  a verb  ent ry  
cons is ts  o f  the  fo l low ing  s teps :  
1. Application of rules rewriting 
a verb pattern code (or more verb pat- 
tern codes if the resulting paradigms 
can be related by a lexical rule) by 
a template or a sequence of templates 
collected by logical operators "and" 
and "or", the result may be marked by 
one or mere lexical rule names. Rules 
rewr i t ing  n~re  l~t ter~ are  pre fer red  
to those  rewr i t ing  fewer  i~t terns .  
A ru le  may be, supp lemented  by  a cond i -  
t ion  stipulating the presence or 
absence of' other paradigi~ within the 
same entry. A rule whose condition is 
sat i s f ied  i s  p re fer red  to  a ru le  
wJ thout  cond i t ion .  Verbs  w i th  pat ter~ 
wh ich  do  not, cor res l~nd to  a s ing le  
complementation i~radigm while co- 
occurring verb patterns do not indic- 
ate  a pre ference  ib r  one  parad igm or  
the other have to be treated ,~nu~lly. 
2. Simplif ication of 
templates by making 
as local as possible. 
the sequence of 
all disjunctions 
3. Consistency check per formed by ex- 
pansion of the sequence of templates 
into feature structures.

a) This is a condition stipulating 
that neither of the pat terrL~ should be 
present; the character ^ stands for 
negation. 
b) This is the template of a preposi- 
tional verb. The lexical value of the 
preposition should be supplied. 
This looks like a principled solu- 
tion, but step i can be a source of 
unforeseen complexities with the 
result that too ,~ny entries will have 
to he handled manually. The second 
strategy is much safer: if there are 
not too many different combinations of 
verb patterns it might not be too 
difficult to state rewriting rules for 
all of them, thus e\]iminati,~ steps 
2 and 3 from the above procedure. 
However, to make a decision, some sta- 
tistical analysis is necessary.

two and more times, 119 three and more 
times and 77 five and mere times. 
Another survey was aimed at finding 
most frequent combinations as proper 
subsets of the full combinations 
treated above. E.g. the combination of 
three  pat terns  2A ,3A,6A occurs  a lone  
in  54 ent r ies ,  but  as  a proper  subset  
o f  a la rger  combinat ion  a l ready  in  
566  ent r ies .  
F rom the  above  data  i t  seems that  
a compromise  between the  t reatment  o f  
ind iv idua l  verb  pat terns  and  o f  ent i re  
combinat ions  wou ld  be  most  e f f i c ient .  
119 combinatio~ can already be 
treated by individual rules quite 
comfortably while the rest can be com- 
posed from results of rules applied 
independently, where more alert super- 
vision is required. It also seems 
feasible to use the rules for combina- 
tions to  t reat  par ts  o f  the  remain ing  
l i s t s  o f  verb  pat terns ,  a r~ perhaps  
add  a few more ,  se#ected  accord ing  to  
the  second s ta t i s t i cs .

Lexicon and gram,~r together form 
the basis for the extraction of lexi- 
cal and structural correspondences. 
Other tools are necessary, however, 
and we are currently designing speci- 
fications for such tools. 
Besides the non-trivial task of 
text cleanup, for which no special 
tools will be used, two major needs 
remain: text unit align,~nt and data 
extraction methods. 
Automatic text unit alignment (on 
word, phrase, and sentence level ) is 
also non-trivia/. On the sentence 
level, we will employ a method for 
al igpmlent based on sentence length 
( Gale 1991 ), for which we have 
developed a f\]exible front-end for 
recognizing sentence houndaries. We 
are considering an extension of 
Church's algorithm taking into account 
lexicon-based elementary word corres- 
pendences (as in Kay (1988) and Cati- 
zone et al (1991) ) for better 
accuracy, but this extension has not 
been implemented yet. 
Methods for data extraction are 
still under development. However, it 
is clear what such data should look 
like. As our output representation is

3 As we are involved in the develop- 
ment of a practical constraint-based 
system, we are aware of the necessity 
to include some centre\] or dynamic in- 
formation in addition to the static 
description sup;x)rted by traditional 
constraint-based for,~lisms. We expect 
to deal with this issue seriously in 
later stages of the project, when par-
