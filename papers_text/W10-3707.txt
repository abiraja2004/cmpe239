Abstract 
Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in 
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (PB-SMT). In this paper, we show 
how single-tokenization of two types of 
multi-word expressions (MWE), namely 
named entities (NE) and compound 
verbs, as well as their prior alignment 
can boost the performance of PB-SMT. 
Single-tokenization of compound verbs 
and named entities (NE) provides sig-
nificant gains over the baseline PB-SMT 
system. Automatic alignment of NEs 
substantially improves the overall MT 
performance, and thereby the word 
alignment quality indirectly. For estab-
lishing NE alignments, we transliterate 
source NEs into the target language and 
then compare them with the target NEs. 
Target language NEs are first converted 
into a canonical form before the com-
parison takes place. Our best system 
achieves statistically significant im-
provements (4.59 BLEU points absolute, 
52.5% relative improvement) on an Eng-
lish?Bangla translation task. 
1 Introduction 
Statistical machine translation (SMT) heavily 
relies on good quality word alignment and 
phrase alignment tables comprising translation 
knowledge acquired from a bilingual corpus. 
Multi-word expressions (MWE) are defined 
as ?idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word 
boundaries (or spaces)? (Sag et al, 2002). Tradi-
tional approaches to word alignment following 
IBM Models (Brown et al, 1993) do not work 
well with multi-word expressions, especially 
with NEs, due to their inability to handle many-
to-many alignments. Firstly, they only carry out 
alignment between words and do not consider 
the case of complex expressions, such as multi-
word NEs. Secondly, the IBM Models only al-
low at most one word in the source language to 
correspond to a word in the target language 
(Marcu, 2001, Koehn et al, 2003). 
In another well-known word alignment ap-
proach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM: Vogel et 
al., 1996), the alignment probabilities depend on 
the alignment position of the previous word. It 
does not explicitly consider many-to-many 
alignment either. 
We address this many-to-many alignment 
problem indirectly. Our objective is to see how 
to best handle the MWEs in SMT. In this work, 
two types of MWEs, namely NEs and compound 
verbs, are automatically identified on both sides 
of the parallel corpus. Then, source and target 
language NEs are aligned using a statistical 
transliteration method. We rely on these auto-
matically aligned NEs and treat them as transla-
tion examples. Adding bilingual dictionaries, 
which in effect are instances of atomic transla-
tion pairs, to the parallel corpus is a well-known 
practice in domain adaptation in SMT (Eck et 
al., 2004; Wu et al, 2008). We modify the paral-
lel corpus by converting the MWEs into single 
tokens and adding the aligned NEs in the parallel 
corpus in a bid to improve the word alignment, 
and hence the phrase alignment quality. This 
46
preprocessing results in improved MT quality in 
terms of automatic MT evaluation metrics. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as 
follows. In section 2 we discuss related work. 
The System is described in Section 3.  Section 4 
includes the results obtained, together with some 
analysis. Section 5 concludes, and provides ave-
nues for further work. 
2 Related Work 
Moore (2003) presented an approach for si-
multaneous NE identification and translation. He 
uses capitalization cues for identifying NEs on 
the English side, and then he applies statistical 
techniques to decide which portion of the target 
language corresponds to the specified English 
NE. Feng et al (2004) proposed a Maximum 
Entropy model based approach for English?
Chinese NE alignment which significantly out-
performs IBM Model4 and HMM. They consid-
ered 4 features: translation score, transliteration 
score, source NE and target NE's co-occurrence 
score, and the distortion score for distinguishing 
identical NEs in the same sentence. Huang et al 
(2003) proposed a method for automatically ex-
tracting NE translingual equivalences between 
Chinese and English based on multi-feature cost 
minimization. The costs considered are translit-
eration cost, word-based translation cost, and NE 
tagging cost. 
Venkatapathy and Joshi (2006) reported a dis-
criminative approach of using the compositional-
ity information about verb-based multi-word 
expressions to improve word alignment quality. 
(Ren et al, 2009) presented log likelihood ratio-
based hierarchical reducing algorithm to auto-
matically extract bilingual MWEs, and investi-
gated the usefulness of these bilingual MWEs in 
SMT by integrating bilingual MWEs into Moses 
(Koehn et al, 2007) in three ways. They ob-
served the highest improvement when they used 
an additional feature to represent whether or not 
a bilingual phrase contains bilingual MWEs. 
This approach was generalized in Carpuat and 
Diab (2010). In their work, the binary feature 
was replaced by a count feature representing the 
number of MWEs in the source language phrase. 
Intuitively, MWEs should be both aligned in 
the parallel corpus and translated as a whole. 
However, in the state-of-the-art PB-SMT, it 
could well be the case that constituents of an 
MWE are marked and aligned as parts of con-
secutive phrases, since PB-SMT (or any other 
approaches to SMT) does not generally treat 
MWEs as special tokens. Another problem SMT 
suffers from is that verb phrases are often 
wrongly translated, or even sometimes deleted in 
the output in order to produce a target sentence 
considered good by the language model. More-
over, the words inside verb phrases seldom show 
the tendency of being aligned one-to-one; the 
alignments of the words inside source and target 
verb phrases are mostly many-to-many, particu-
larly so for the English?Bangla language pair. 
These are the motivations behind considering 
NEs and compound verbs for special treatment 
in this work. 
By converting the MWEs into single tokens, 
we make sure that PB-SMT also treats them as a 
whole. The objective of the present work is two-
fold; firstly to see how treatment of NEs and 
compound verbs as a single unit affects the 
overall MT quality, and secondly whether prior 
automatic alignment of these single-tokenized 
MWEs can bring about any further improvement 
on top of that. 
We carried out our experiments on an Eng-
lish?Bangla translation task, a relatively hard 
task with Bangla being a morphologically richer 
language.

3.2 Preprocessing of the Parallel Corpus 
The initial English?Bangla parallel corpus is 
cleaned and filtered using a semi-automatic 
process. We employed two kinds of multi-word 
information: compound verbs and NEs. Com-
pound verbs are first identified on both sides of 
the parallel corpus. Chakrabarty et al (2008) 
analyzed and identified a category of V+V com-
plex predicates called lexical compound verbs 
for Hindi. We adapted their strategy for identifi-
cation of compound verbs in Bangla. In addition 
to V+V construction, we also consider N+V and 
ADJ+V structures. 
NEs are also identified on both sides of trans-
lation pairs. NEs in Bangla are much harder to 
identify than in English (Ekbal and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2009). This can be attributed to the fact 
that (i) there is no concept of capitalization in 
Bangla; and (ii) Bangla common nouns are often 
used as proper names. In Bangla, the problem is 
compounded by the fact that suffixes (case 
markers, plural markers, emphasizers, specifiers) 
are also added to proper names, just like to any 
other common nouns. As a consequence, the ac-
curacy of Bangla NE recognizers (NER) is much 
poorer compared to that for English. Once the 
compound verbs and the NEs are identified on 
both sides of the parallel corpus, they are con-
verted into and replaced by single tokens. When 
converting these MWEs into single tokens, we 
replace the spaces with underscores (?_?). Since 
there are already some hyphenated words in the 
corpus, we do not use hyphenation for this pur-
pose; besides, the use of a special word separator 
(underscore in our case) facilitates the job of 
deciding which single-token (target language) 
MWEs to detokenize into words comprising 
them, before evaluation. 
3.3 Transliteration  Using Modified Joint 
Source-Channel Model 
Li et al (2004) proposed a generative framework 
allowing direct orthographical mapping of trans-
literation units through a joint source-channel 
model, which is also called n-gram translitera-
tion model. They modeled the segmentation of 
names into transliteration units (TU) and their 
alignment preferences using maximum likeli-
hood via EM algorithm (Dempster et al, 1977). 
Unlike the noisy-channel model, the joint 
source-channel model tries to capture how 
source and target names can be generated simul-
taneously by means of contextual n-grams of the 
transliteration units. For K aligned TUs, they 
define the bigram model as in (6): 
 )...,,...,(),( 2121 KK bbbeeePBEP =  
  ),...,,,( 21 KbebebeP ><><><=  
   ? ><><= K
=k
k bebeP
1
1-k
1 ),|,(         (6) 
where E refers to the English name and B the 
transliteration in Bengali, while ei and bi refer to 
the ith English and Bangla segment (TU) respec-
tively. 
Ekbal et al (2006) presented a modification to 
the joint source-channel model to incorporate 
different contextual information into the model 
for Indian languages. They used regular expres-
sions and language-specific heuristics based on 
consonant and vowel patterns to segment names 
into TUs. Their modified joint source-channel 
model, for which they obtained improvement 
48
over the original joint source-channel model, 
essentially considers a trigram model for the 
source language and a bigram model for the tar-
get, as in (7).

Ekbal et al (2006) reported a word agreement 
ratio of 67.9% on an English?Bangla translit-
eration task. In the present work, we use the 
modified joint source-channel model of (Ekbal 
et al, 2006) to translate names for establishing 
NE alignments in the parallel corpus. 
3.4 Automatic Alignment of NEs through 
Transliteration 
We first create an NE parallel corpus by extract-
ing the source and target (single token) NEs 
from the NE-tagged parallel translations in 
which both sides contain at least one NE. For 
example, we extract the NE translation pairs 
given in (9) from the sentence pair shown in (8), 
where the NEs are shown as italicized. 
(8a) Kirti_Mandir , where Mahatma_Gandhi 
was born , today houses a photo exhibition on 
the life and times of the Mahatma , a library, a 
prayer hall and other memorabilia . 
(8b) ??????_??n? , ?????? ???t?_??n? ??n????? , 
???????? ?????? ???t?? ???? o ??i ????? 
?????????? e??? ??tp????????? , e??? ??i?b?? o 
e??? p?????? ?? e?? a????? s ????????? ??????t 
??? ? 
(9a) Kirti_Mandir Mahatma_Gandhi Mahatma 
(9b) ??????_??n? ???t?_??n? ???t?? 
Then we try to align the source and target NEs 
extracted from a parallel sentence, as illustrated 
in (9). If both sides contain only one NE then the 
alignment is trivial, and we add such NE pairs to 
seed another parallel NE corpus that contains 
examples having only one token in both side. 
Otherwise, we establish alignments between the 
source and target NEs using transliteration. We 
use the joint source-channel model of translitera-
tion (Ekbal et al, 2006) for this purpose.  
If both the source and target side contains n 
number of NEs, and the alignments of n-1 NEs 
can be established through transliteration or by 
means of already existing alignments, then the 
nth alignment is trivial. However, due to the rela-
tive performance difference of the NERs for the 
source and target language, the number of NEs 
identified on the source and target sides is al-
most always unequal (see Section 4). Accord-
ingly, we always use transliteration to establish 
alignments even when it is assumed to be trivial. 
Similarly, for multi-word NEs, intra-NE word 
alignments are established through translitera-
tion or by means of already existing alignments. 
For a multi-word source NE, if we can align all 
the words inside the NE with words inside a tar-
get NE, then we assume they are translations of 
each other. Due to the relatively poor perform-
ance of the Bangla NER, we also store the im-
mediate left and right neighbouring words for 
every NE in Bangla, just in case the left or the 
right word is a valid part of the NE but is not 
properly tagged by the NER. 
As mentioned earlier, since the source side 
NER is much more reliable than the target side 
NER, we transliterate the English NEs, and try 
to align them with the Bangla NEs. For aligning 
(capitalized) English words to Bangla words, we 
take the 5 best transliterations produced by the 
transliteration system for an English word, and 
compare them against the Bangla words. Bangla 
NEs often differ in their choice of matras (vowel 
modifiers). Thus we first normalize the Bangla 
words, both in the target NEs and the transliter-
ated ones, to a canonical form by dropping the 
matras, and then compare the results. In effect, 
therefore, we just compare the consonant se-
quences of every transliteration candidate with 
that of a target side Bangla word; if they match, 
then we align the English word with the Bangla 
word. 
???? (? + ??+ ? + ?) -- ????? (? + ?? + ? + ?? + ?) 
      (10) 
The example in (10) illustrates the procedure. 
Assume, we are trying to align ?Niraj? with 
???????. The transliteration system produces 
?????? from the English word ?Niraj? and we 
compare ?????? with ???????. Since the conso-
nant sequences match in both words, ?????? is 
considered a spelling variation of ???????, and 
the English word ?Niraj? is aligned to the 
Bangla word ???????. 
In this way, we achieve word-level align-
ments, as well as NE-level alignments. (11) 
shows the alignments established from (8). The 
word-level alignments help to establish new 
49
word / NE alignments. Word and NE alignments 
obtained in this way are added to the parallel 
corpus as additional training data.

3.5 Tools and Resources Used 
A sentence-aligned English?Bangla parallel 
corpus containing 14,187 parallel sentences from 
a travel and tourism domain was used in the pre-
sent work. The corpus was obtained from the 
consortium-mode project ?Development of Eng-
lish to Indian Languages Machine Translation 
(EILMT) System? 1. 
The Stanford Parser2 and the CRF chunker3 
were used for identifying compound verbs in the 
source side of the parallel corpus. The Stanford 
NER4 was used to identify NEs on the source 
side (English) of the parallel corpus. 
The sentences on the target side (Bangla) 
were POS-tagged by using the tools obtained 
from the consortium mode project ?Develop-
ment of Indian Languages to Indian Languages 
Machine Translation (ILILMT) System?. NEs in 
Bangla are identified using the NER system of 
Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay (2008). We use the 
Stanford Parser, Stanford NER and the NER for 
Bangla along with the default model files pro-
vided, i.e., with no additional training. 
The effectiveness of the MWE-aligned paral-
lel corpus developed in the work is demonstrated 
by using the standard log-linear PB-SMT model 
as our baseline system: GIZA++ implementation 
of IBM word alignment model 4, phrase-
extraction heuristics described in (Koehn et al, 
2003), minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) 
on a held-out development set, target language 
model with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and

4 Experiments and Results 
We randomly extracted 500 sentences each for 
the development set and testset from the initial 
parallel corpus, and treated the rest as the train-
ing corpus. After filtering on maximum allow-
able sentence length of 100 and sentence length 
ratio of 1:2 (either way), the training corpus con-
tained 13,176 sentences. In addition to the target 
side of the parallel corpus, a monolingual Bangla 
corpus containing 293,207 words from the tour-
ism domain was used for the target language 
model. We experimented with different n-gram 
settings for the language model and the maxi-
mum phrase length, and found that a 4-gram 
language model and a maximum phrase length 
of 4 produced the optimum baseline result. We 
therefore carried out the rest of the experiments 
using these settings.

equal number of NEs on both sides, and 13,654 
sentences had an unequal number of NEs. Simi-
larly, for the testset, all the sentences had at least 
one NE on both sides, and none had an equal 
number of NEs on both sides. It gives an indica-
tion of the relative performance differences of 
the NERs. 6.6% and 6.58% of the source tokens 
belong to NEs in the training and testset respec-
tively. These statistics reveal the high degree of 
NEs in the tourism domain data that demands 
special treatment. Of the 225 unique NEs ap-
pearing on the source side of the testset, only 65 
NEs are found in the training set.

Table 2.  Evaluation results for different experimental setups (The ??? marked systems produce

Table 1 shows the MWE statistics of the 
parallel corpus as identified by the NERs. The 
average NE length in the training corpus is 
2.16 for English and 1.61 for Bangla. As can 
be seen from Table 1, 44.5% and 47.8% of the 
NEs are single-word NEs in English and 
Bangla respectively, which suggests that prior 
alignment of the single-word NEs, in addition 
to multi-word NE alignment, should also be 
beneficial to word and phrase alignment. 
Of all the NEs in the training and develop-
ment sets, the transliteration-based alignment 
process was able to establish alignments of 
4,711 single-word NEs, 4,669 two-word NEs 
and 1,745 NEs having length more than two. 
It is to be noted that, some of the single-word 
NE alignments, as well as two-word NE 
alignments, result from multi-word NE align-
ment. 
We analyzed the output of the NE align-
ment module and observed that longer NEs 
were aligned better than the shorter ones, 
which is quite intuitive, as longer NEs have 
more tokens to be considered for intra-NE 
alignment. Since the NE alignment process is 
based on transliteration, the alignment method 
does not work where NEs involve translation 
or acronyms. We also observed that English 
multi-word NEs are sometimes fused together 
into single-word NEs. 
We performed three sets of experiments: 
treating compound verbs as single tokens, 
treating NEs as single tokens, and the combi-
nation thereof. Again for NEs, we carried out 
three types of preprocessing: single-
tokenization of (i) two-word NEs, (ii) more 
than two-word NEs, and (iii) NEs of any 
length. We make distinctions among these 
three to see their relative effects. The devel-
opment and test sets, as well as the target lan-
guage monolingual corpus (for language mod-
eling), are also subjected to the same preproc-
essing of single-tokenizing the MWEs. For 
NE alignment, we performed experiments us-
ing 4 different settings: alignment of (i) NEs 
of length up to two, (ii) NEs of length two, 
51
(iii) NEs of length greater than two, and (iv) 
NEs of any length. Before evaluation, the sin-
gle-token (target language) underscored 
MWEs are expanded back to words compris-
ing the MWEs. 
Since we did not have the gold-standard 
word alignment, we could not perform intrin-
sic evaluation of the word alignment. Instead 
we carry out extrinsic evaluation on the MT 
quality using the well known automatic MT 
evaluation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al, 
2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), 
NIST (Doddington, 2002), WER, PER and 
TER (Snover et al, 2006). As can be seen 
from the evaluation results reported in Table 
2, baseline Moses without any preprocessing 
of the dataset produces a BLEU score of 8.74. 
The low score can be attributed to the fact that 
Bangla, a morphologically rich language, is 
hard to translate into. Moreover, Bangla being 
a relatively free phrase order language (Ekbal 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2009) ideally requires 
multiple set of references for proper evalua-
tion. Hence using a single reference set does 
not justify evaluating translations in Bangla. 
Also the training set was not sufficiently large 
enough for SMT. Treating only longer than 2-
word NEs as single tokens does not help im-
prove the overall performance much, while 
single tokenization  of two-word NEs as single 
tokens produces some improvements (.39 
BLEU points absolute, 4.5% relative). Con-
sidering compound verbs as single tokens 
(CVaST) produces a .82 BLEU point im-
provement (9.4% relative) over the baseline. 
Strangely, when both compound verbs and 
NEs together are counted as single tokens, 
there is hardly any improvement. By contrast, 
automatic NE alignment  (NEA) gives a huge 
impetus to system performance, the best of 
them (4.59 BLEU points absolute, 52.5% rela-
tive improvement) being the alignment of NEs 
of any length that produces the best scores 
across all metrics. When NEA is combined 
with CVaST, the improvements are substan-
tial, but it can not beat the individual im-
provement on NEA. The (?) marked systems 
produce statistically significant improvements 
as measured by bootstrap resampling method 
(Koehn, 2004) on BLEU over the baseline 
system. Metric-wise individual best scores are 
shown in bold in Table 2. 
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we have successfully shown 
how the simple yet effective preprocessing of 
treating two types of MWEs, namely NEs and 
compound verbs, as single-tokens, in conjunc-
tion with prior NE alignment can boost the 
performance of PB-SMT system on an Eng-
lish?Bangla translation task. Treating com-
pound verbs as single-tokens provides signifi-
cant gains over the baseline PB-SMT system. 
Amongst the MWEs, NEs perhaps play the 
most important role in MT, as we have clearly 
demonstrated through experiments that auto-
matic alignment of NEs by means of translit-
eration improves the overall MT performance 
substantially across all automatic MT evalua-
tion metrics. Our best system yields 4.59 
BLEU points improvement over the baseline, 
a 52.5% relative increase. We compared a 
subset of the output of our best system with 
that of the baseline system, and the output of 
our best system almost always looks better in 
terms of either lexical choice or word order-
ing. The fact that only 28.5% of the testset 
NEs appear in the training set, yet prior auto-
matic alignment of the NEs brings about so 
much improvement in terms of MT quality, 
suggests that it not only improves the NE 
alignment quality in the phrase table, but word 
alignment and phrase alignment quality must 
have also been improved significantly. At the 
same time, single-tokenization of MWEs 
makes the dataset sparser, but yet improves 
the quality of MT output to some extent. Data-
driven approaches to MT, specifically for 
scarce-resource language pairs for which very 
little parallel texts are available, should benefit 
from these preprocessing methods. Data 
sparseness is perhaps the reason why single-
tokenization of NEs and compound verbs, 
both individually and in collaboration, did not 
add significantly to the scores. However, a 
significantly large parallel corpus can take 
care of the data sparseness problem introduced 
by the single-tokenization of MWEs. 
The present work offers several avenues for 
further work. In future, we will investigate 
how these automatically aligned NEs can be 
52
used as anchor words to directly influence the 
word alignment process. We will look into 
whether similar kinds of improvements can be 
achieved for larger datasets, corpora from dif-
ferent domains and for other language pairs. 
We will also investigate how NE alignment 
quality can be improved, especially where 
NEs involve translation and acronyms. We 
will also try to perform morphological analy-
sis or stemming on the Bangla side before NE 
alignment. We will also explore whether dis-
criminative approaches to word alignment can 
be employed to improve the precision of the 
NE alignment.
