Abstract
Chinese and Japanese have a different sen-
tence structure. Reordering methods are
effective, but need reliable parsers to ex-
tract the syntactic structure of the source
sentences. However, Chinese has a loose
word order, and Chinese parsers that ex-
tract the phrase structure do not perform
well. We propose a framework where only
POS tags and unlabeled dependency parse
trees are necessary, and linguistic knowl-
edge on structural difference can be en-
coded in the form of reordering rules. We
show significant improvements in transla-
tion quality of sentences from news do-
main, when compared to state-of-the-art
reordering methods.
1 Introduction
Translation between Chinese and Japanese lan-
guages gains interest as their economic and polit-
ical relationship intensifies. Despite their linguis-
tic influences, these languages have different syn-
tactic structures and phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems do not perform
well. Current word alignment models (Och and
Ney, 2003) account for local differences in word
order between bilingual sentences, but fail at cap-
turing long distance word alignments. One of
the main problems in the search of the best word
alignment is the combinatorial explosion of word
orders, but linguistically-motivated heuristics can
help to guide the search.
This work explores syntax-informed pre-
reordering for Chinese; that is, we obtain syntactic
structures of Chinese sentences, reorder the words
to resemble the Japanese word order, and then
translate the reordered sentences using a phrase-
based SMT system. However, Chinese parsers
have difficulties in extracting reliable syntactic in-
formation, mainly because Chinese has a loose
word order and few syntactic clues such as inflec-
tion and function words.
On one hand, parsers implementing head-driven
phrase structure grammars infer a detailed con-
stituent structure, and such a rich syntactic struc-
ture can be exploited to design well informed re-
ordering methods. However, inferring abundant
syntactic information often implies introducing er-
rors, and reordering methods that heavily rely on
detailed information are sensitive to those parsing
errors (Han et al, 2012).
On the other hand, dependency parsers are com-
mitted to the simpler task of finding dependency
relations and dependency labels, which can also be
useful to guide reordering (Xu et al, 2009). How-
ever, reordering methods that rely on those depen-
dency labels will also be prone to errors, specially
in the case of Chinese since it has a richer set of
dependency labels when compared to other lan-
guages. Since improving parsers for Chinese is
challenging, we thus aim at reducing the influence
of parsing errors in the reordering procedure.
We present a hybrid approach that boosts the
performance of phrase-based SMT systems by
pre-reordering the source language using unla-
beled parse trees augmented with constituent
information derived from Part-of-Speech tags.
Specifically, we propose a framework to pre-
reorder a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language,
in order to improve its translation to a Subject-
Object-Verb (SOV) language, where the only re-
quired syntactic information are POS tags and un-
labeled dependency parse trees. We test the per-
formance of our pre-reordering method and com-
pare it to state-of-the-art reordering methods in the
news domain for Chinese.
In the next section, we describe similar work on
pre-reordering methods for language pairs that in-
25
volve either Chinese or Japanese, and explain how
our method builds upon them. From a linguis-
tic perspective, we describe in section 3 our ob-
servations of reordering issues between Chinese
and Japanese and detail how our framework solves
those issues. In section 4 we assess to what extent
our pre-reordering method succeeds in reordering
words in Chinese sentences to resemble the order
of Japanese sentences, and measure its impact on
translation quality. The last section is dedicated to
discuss our findings and point to future directions.
2 Related Work
Although there are many works on pre-reordering
methods for other languages to English translation
or inverse (Xia and McCord, 2004; Xu et al, 2009;
Habash, 2007; Wang et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007;
Wu et al, 2011), reordering method for Chinese-
to-Japanese translation, which is a representative
of long distance language pairs, has received little
attention.
The most related work to ours is in (Han et al,
2012), in which the authors introduced a refined
reordering approach by importing an existing re-
ordering method for English proposed in (Isozaki
et al, 2010b). These reordering strategies are
based on Head-driven phrase structure grammars
(HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994), in that the re-
ordering decisions are made based on the head of
phrases. Specifically, HPSG parsers (Miyao and
Tsujii, 2008; Yu et al, 2011) are used to extract the
structure of sentences in the form of binary trees,
and head branches are swapped with their depen-
dents according to certain heuristics to resemble
the word order of the target language. However,
those strategies are sensitive to parsing errors, and
the binary structure of their parse trees impose
hard constraints in sentences with loose word or-
der. Moreover, as Han et al (2012) noted, reorder-
ing strategies that are derived from the HPSG the-
ory may not perform well when the head definition
is inconsistent in the language pair under study. A
typical example for the language pair of Chinese
and Japanese that illustrates this phenomenon is
the adverb ?bu4?, which is the dependent of its
verb in Chinese but the head in Japanese.
The work in (Xu et al, 2009) used an English
dependency parser and formulated handcrafted re-
ordering rules with dependency labels, POS tags
and weights as triplets and implemented them re-
cursively into sentences. This design, however,
limited the extensibility of their method. Our ap-
proach follows the idea of using dependency tree
structures and POS tags, but we discard the infor-
mation on dependency labels since we did not find
them informative to guide our reordering strate-
gies in our preliminary experiments, partly due to
Chinese showing less dependencies and a larger
label variability (Chang et al, 2009).
3 Methodology
In Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) languages, objects
usually follow their verbs, while in Subject-
Object-Verb (SOV) languages, objects precede
them. Our objective is to reorder words in Chinese
sentences (SVO) to resemble the word order of
Japanese sentences (SOV). For that purpose, our
method consists in moving verbs to the right-hand
side of their objects. However, it is challenging
to correctly identify the appropriate verbs and ob-
jects that trigger a reordering, and this section will
be dedicated to that end.
More specifically, the first step of our method
consists in identifying the appropriate verb (and
certain words close to it) that need to be moved to
the right-hand side of its object argument. Verbs
(and those accompanying words) will move as a
block, preserving the relative order among them.
We will refer to them as verbal blocks (Vbs). The
second step will consist in identifying the right-
most argument object of the verb under considera-
tion, and moving the verbal block to the right-hand
side of it. Finally, certain invariable grammatical
particles in the original vicinity of the verb will
also be reordered, but their positions will be de-
cided relative to their verb.
In what follows, we describe in detail how to
identify verbal blocks, their objects and the invari-
able grammatical particles that will play a role in
our reordering method. As mentioned earlier, the
only information that will be used to perform this
task will be the POS tags of the words and their
unlabeled dependency structures.
3.1 Identifying verbal blocks (Vbs)
Verbal blocks are composed of a head (Vb-H)
and possibly accompanying dependents (Vb-D).
In the Chinese sentence ?wo3 (I) chi1 le5 (ate) li2
(pear).?1, ?chi1? refers to the English verb ?eat?
1In this paper, we represent a Chinese character by using
Pinyin plus a tone number (there are 5 tones in Chinese). In
the example, ?chi1(eat)? is a verb and ?le5(-ed)? is an aspect
particle that adds preterit tense to the verb.

need to be reordered.
and the aspect particle ?le5? adds a preterit tense
to the verb. The words ?chi1 le5? are an example
of verbal block that should be reordered as a block
without altering its inner word order, i.e. ?wo3
(I) li2 (pear) chi1 le5 (ate).?, which matches the
Japanese SOV order.
Possible heads of verbal blocks (Vb-H) are
verbs (words with POS tags VV, VE, VC and VA),
or prepositions (words with POS tag P). The Vb-H
entry of Table 1 contains the list of POS tags for
heads of verbal blocks. We use prepositions for
Vb-H identification since they behave similarly to
verbs in Chinese and should be moved to the right-
most position in a prepositional phrase to resemble
the Japanese word order. There are three condi-
tions that a word should meet to be considered as
a Vb-H:
i) Its POS tag is in the set of Vb-H in Table 1.
ii) It is a dependency head, which indicates that
it may have an object as a dependent.
iii) It has no dependent whose POS tag is in the
set of BEI in Table 1. BEI particles indicate
that the verb is in passive voice and should
not be reordered since it already resembles
the Japanese order.
Chinese language does not have inflection, con-
jugation, or case markers (Li and Thompson,
1989). For that reason, some adverbs (AD), as-
pect particles (AS) or sentence-final particles (SP)
are used to signal modality, indicate grammati-
cal tense or add aspectual value to verbs. Words
in this category preserve the order when translat-
ing to Japanese, and they will be candidates to be
part of the verbal block (Vb-D) and accompany
the verb when it is reordered. Other words in this
category are coordinating conjunctions (CC) that
connect multiple verbs, and both resultative ?de5?
(DER) and manner ?de5? (DEV). The full list of
POS tags used to identify Vb-Ds can be found in
Table 1. To be a Vb-D, there are three necessary
conditions as well:
i) Its POS tag is in the Vb-D entry in Table 1.
ii) It is a dependent of a word that is already in
the Vb.
iii) It is next to its dependency head or only a
coordination conjunction is in between.
To summarize, to build verbal blocks (Vbs) we
first find the words that meet the three Vb-H con-
ditions. Then, we test the Vb-D conditions on the
words adjacent to the Vb-Hs and extend the verbal
blocks to them if they meet the conditions. This
process is iteratively applied to the adjacent words
of a block until no more words can be added to the
verbal block, possibly nesting other verbal blocks
if necessary.
Figure 1a 2 shows an example of a dependency
tree of a Chinese sentence that will be used to il-
lustrate Vb identification. By observing the POS
tags of the words in the sentence, only the words
?bian1 ji4 (edit)? and ?chu1 ban3 (publish)? have
a POS tag (i.e. VV) in the Vb-H entry of Table 1.
Moreover, both words are dependency heads and
do not have any dependent whose POS tag is in
the BEI entry of Table 1. Thus, ?bian1 ji4 (edit)?
and ?chu1 ban3 (publish)? will be selected as Vb-
Hs and form, by themselves, two separate incipi-
ent Vbs. We arbitrarily start building the Vb from
the word ?chu1 ban3 (publish)?, by analyzing its
adjacent words that are its dependents.
We observe that only ?le5 (-ed)? is adjacent to
?chu1 ban3 (publish)?, it is its dependent, and its
POS tag is in the Vb-D list. Since ?le5 (-ed)?
meets all three conditions stated above, ?le5 (-ed)?
will be included in the Vb originated by ?chu1
ban3 (publish)?. The current Vb thus consists of
the sequence of tokens ?chu1 ban3 (publish)? and
?le5 (-ed)?, and the three conditions for Vb-D are
tested on the adjacent words of this block. Since
the adjacent words (or words separated by a coor-
dinating conjunction) do not meet the conditions,
the block is not further extended. Figure 1b shows
the dependency tree where the Vb block that con-
sists of the words ?chu1 ban3 (publish)? and ?le5
(-ed)? is represented by a rectangular box.
By checking in the same way, there are three
dependents that meet the requirements of being

Vb. The outer rectangular box in Figure 1b shows
that the Vb ?bian1 ji4 (edit)? as the Vb-H. Fig-
ure 1c shows an image of how this Vb will be
reordered while the inner orders are kept. Note
that the order of building Vbs from which Vb-Hs,
?chu1 ban3 (publish)? or ?bian1 ji4 (edit)? will not
affect any change of the final result.
3.2 Identifying objects
In the most general form, objects are dependents
of verbal blocks3 that act as their arguments.
While the simplest objects are nouns (N) or pro-
nouns (PN), they can also be comprised of noun
phrases or clauses (Downing and Locke, 2006)
such as nominal groups, finite clauses (e.g. that
clauses, wh-clauses) or non-finite clauses (e.g. -
ing clauses), among others.
For every Vb in a verb phrase, clause, or sen-
tence, we define the right-most object dependent
(RM-D) as the word that:
3Dependents of verbal blocks are dependents of any word
within the verbal block.

Figure 2: An example of a Chinese sentence with
a coordination of verb phrases as predicate. Sub-
ject(S), verbs(V), and objects(O) are displayed for
both verb phrases. Lines between the original Chi-
nese sentence and the reordered Chinese sentence
indicate the reordering trace of Verbal blocks(Vb).
i) its POS tag is in the RM-D entry of Table 1,
ii) its dependency head is inside of the verbal
block, and
iii) is the right-most object among all objects of
the verbal block.
All verbal blocks in the phrase, clause, or sen-
tence will move to the right-hand side of their cor-
respondent RM-Ds recursively. Figure 1b and Fig-
ure 1c show a basic example of object identifica-
tion. The Chinese word corresponding to ?shu1
(book)? is a dependent of a word within the verbal
block and its POS tag is within the RM-D entry
list of Table 1 (i.e. NN). For this reason, ?shu1
(book)? is identified as the right-most dependent
of the verbal block (Vb), and the Vb will move to
the right-hand side of it to resemble the Japanese
word order.
A slightly more complex example can be found
in Figure 2. In this example, there is a coordina-
tion structure of verb phrases, and the dependency
tree shows that the first verb, ?chi1 (eat)?, ap-
pears as the dependency head of the second verb,
?qu4 (go)?. The direct right-most object depen-
dent (RM-D) of the first verb, ?chi1 (eat)?, is the
word ?wu3 fan4 (lunch)?, and the verb ?chi1 (eat)?
will be moved to the right-hand side of its object
dependent.
There are cases, however, where there is no co-
ordination structure of verb phrases but a simi-
lar dependency relation occurs between two verbs.
Figure 3 illustrates one of these cases, where the
main verb ?gu3 li4 (encourage)? has no direct de-

pendent that can be considered as an object since
no direct dependent has a POS tag in the RM-D en-
try of Table 1. Instead, an embedded clause (SVO)
appears as the object argument of the main verb,
and the main verb ?gu3 li4 (encourage)? appears
as the dependency head of the verb ?can1 yu2 (par-
ticipate)?.
In the news domain, reported speech is a fre-
quent example that follows this pattern. In our
method, if the main verb of the sentence (labeled
as ROOT) has dependents but none of them is a
direct object, we move the main verb to the end of
the sentence. As for the embedded clause ?xue2
sheng1 (student) can1 yu2 (participate) she4 hui4
(social) shi2 jian4 (practice)?, the verbal block of
the clause is the word ?can1 yu2 (participate)?
and its object is ?shi2 jian4 (practice)?. Apply-
ing our reordering method, the clause order results
in ?xue2 sheng1 (student) she4 hui4 (social) shi2
jian4 (practice) can1 yu2 (participate)?. The result
is an SOV sentence with an SOV clause, which
resembles the Japanese word order.
3.3 Identifying invariable grammatical
particles
In Chinese, certain invariable grammatical parti-
cles that accompany verbal heads have a different
word order relative to their heads, when compared
to Japanese. Those particles are typically ?bei4?
particle (POS tags LB and SB) and subordinating
conjunctions (POS tag CS). Those particles appear
on the left-hand side of their dependency heads in
Chinese, and they should be moved to the right-
hand side of their dependency heads for them to
resemble the Japanese word order. Reordering in-
variable grammatical particles in our framework
can be summarized as:
i) Find dependents of a verbal head (Vb-H)
whose POS tags are in the Oth-DEP entry of
Table 1.
ii) Move those particles to the right-hand side of
their (possibly reordered) heads.
iii) If there is more than one such particle, move
them keeping the relative order among them.
3.4 Summary of the reordering framework
Based on the definitions above, our dependency
parsing based pre-reordering framework can be
summarized in the following steps:
1. Obtain POS tags and an unlabeled depen-
dency tree of a Chinese sentence.
2. Obtain reordering candidates: Vbs.
3. Obtain the object (RM-D) of each Vb.
4. Reorder each Vb in two exclusive cases by
following the order:
(a) If RM-D exists, reorder Vb to be the
right-hand side of RM-D.
(b) If Vb-H is ROOT and its RM-D does not
exist, reorder Vb to the end of the sen-
tence.
(c) If none of above two conditions is met,
no reordering happens.
5. Reorder grammatical particles (Oth-DEPs) to
the right-hand side of their corresponding
Vbs.
Note that, unlike other works in reordering dis-
tant languages (Isozaki et al, 2010b; Han et al,
2012; Xu et al, 2009), we do not prevent chunks
from crossing punctuations or coordination struc-
tures. Thus, our method allows to achieve an
authentic global reordering in reported speech,
which is an important reordering issue in news do-
mains.
In order to illustrate our method, a more compli-
cated Chinese sentence example is given in Fig-
ure 4, which includes the unlabeled dependency

parsing tree of the original Chinese sentence, and
the word alignment between reordered Chinese
sentence and its Japanese counterpart, etc.
Based on both POS tags and the unlabeled de-
pendency tree, first step of our method is to obtain
all Vbs. For all heads in the tree, according to the
definition of Vb introduced in Section 3.1, there
are six tokens which will be recognized as the can-
didates of Vb-Hs, that is ?bao4 dao3 (report)?,
?sui2 zhe5 (with)?, ?jin4 ru4 (enter)?, ?cheng2
wei2 (become)?, ?jia1 qiang2 (strengthen)?, and
?li4 cu4 (urge)?. Then, for each of the candidate,
its direct dependents will be checked if they are
Vb-Ds. For instance, for the verb of ?jin4 ru4 (en-
ter)?, its dependents of ?zhu2 jian4 (gradually)?
and ?le5 (-ed)? will be considered as the Vb-Ds.
For the case of ?jia1 qiang2 (strengthen)?, instead
of being a Vb-H, it will be recognized as Vb-D
of the Vb ?li4 cu4 (urge)? since it is one of the
direct dependents of ?li4 cu4 (urge)? with a qual-
ified POS tag for Vb-D. Therefore, there are five
Vbs in total, which are ?bao4 dao3 (report)?, ?sui2
zhe5 (with)?, ?zhu2 jian4 (gradually) jin4 ru4 (en-
ter) le5 (-ed)?, ?cheng2 wei2 (become)?, and ?jia1
qiang2 (strengthen) li4 cu4 (urge)?.
The next step is to identify RM-D for each
Vb, if there is one. By checking all conditions,
four Vbs have their RM-Ds: ?fa1 zhan3 (develop-
ment)? is the RM-D of the Vb ?sui2 zhe5 (with)?;
?zhong1 guo2 (China)? is the RM-D of the Vb
?zhu2 jian4 (gradually) jin4 ru4 (enter) le5 (-ed)?;
?jie2 ri4 (festival)? is the RM-D of the Vb ?cheng2
wei2 (become)?; ?mai3 qi4 (purchase)? is the RM-
D of the Vb ?jia1 qiang2 (strengthen) li4 cu4
(urge)?.
After obtaining all RM-Ds, we find those Vbs
that have RM-Ds and move them to right of their
RM-Ds. As for the case of ?bao4 dao3 (report)?,
since it is the root and does not have any matched
RM-D, it will be moved to the end of the sen-
tence, before any final punctuation. Finally, since
there is no any invariable grammatical particle in
the sentence that need to be reordered, reordering
has been finished. From the alignments between
the reordered Chinese and its Japanese translation
showed in the figure, an almost monotonic word
alignment has been achieved.
For comparison purposes, particle seed words
had been inserted into the reordered sentences in
the same way as the Refined-HFC method, which
is using the information of predicate argument
structure output by Chinese Enju (Yu et al, 2011).
We therefore can not entirely disclaim the use
of the HPSG parser at the present stage in our
method. However, we believe that dependency
parser can provide enough information for insert-
ing particles.
4 Experiments
We conducted experiments to assess how our pro-
posed dependency-based pre-reordering for Chi-
nese (DPC) impacts on translation quality, and
compared it to a baseline phrase-based system
and a Refined-HFC pre-reordering for Chinese to
Japanese translation.
We used two Chinese-Japanese training data

disjoint development and test sets from News cor-

We used MeCab 4 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000)
and the Stanford Chinese segmenter 5 (Chang et

tences. POS tags of Chinese sentences were ob-
tained using the Berkeley parser 6 (Petrov et al,
2006), while dependency trees were extracted us-
ing Corbit 7 (Hatori et al, 2011). Following the
work in (Han et al, 2012), we re-implemented
the Refined-HFC using the Chinese Enju to ob-
tain HPSG parsing trees. For comparison purposes
with the work in (Isozaki et al, 2010b), particle
seed words were inserted at a preprocessing stage
for Refined-HFC and our DPC method.
DPC and Refined-HFC pre-reordering strate-
gies were followed in the pipeline by a standard
Moses-based baseline system (Koehn et al, 2007),
using a default distance reordering model and a
lexicalized reordering model ?msd-bidirectional-
fe?. A 5-gram language model was built using
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) on the target side of the
corresponding training corpus. Word alignments
were extracted using MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel,
2008) and the parameters of the log-linear combi-
nation were tuned using MERT (Och, 2003).
Table 3 summarizes the results of the Baseline
system (no pre-reordering nor particle word inser-
tion), the Refined-HFC (Ref-HFC) and our DPC
method, using the well-known BLEU score (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) and a word order sensitive met-
ric named RIBES (Isozaki et al, 2010a).

As it can be observed, our DPC method obtains
around 0.7 BLEU points of improvement when
compared to the second best system in both cor-
pora. When measuring the translation quality in
terms of RIBES, our method obtains an improve-
ment of 0.3 and 0.2 points when compared to the
second best system in News and CWMT + News
corpora, respectively. We suspect that corpus di-
versity might be one of the reasons for Refined-
HFC not to show any advantage in this setting.
We tested the significance of BLEU improve-
ment for Refined-HFC and DPC when compared
to the baseline phrase-based system. Refined-HFC
tests obtained p-values 0.355 and 0.135 on News
and CWMT + News corpora, while our proposed
DPC method obtained p-values 0.002 and 0.0,
which indicates significant improvements over the
phrase-based system.
5 Conclusions
In the present paper, we have analyzed the dif-
ferences in word order between Chinese and
Japanese sentences. We captured the regulari-
ties of ordering differences between Chinese and
Japanese sentences, and proposed a framework to
reorder Chinese sentences to resemble the word
order of Japanese.
Our framework consists in three steps. First,
we identify verbal blocks, which consist of Chi-
nese words that will move all together as a block
without altering their relative inner order. Sec-
ond, we identify the right-most object of the verbal
block, and move the verbal block to the right of it.
Finally, we identify invariable grammatical parti-
cles in the original vicinity of the verbal block and
move them relative to their dependency heads.
Our framework only uses the unlabeled depen-
dency structure of sentences and POS tag informa-
tion of words. We compared our system to a base-
line phrase-based SMT system and a refined head-
finalization system. Our method obtained a Chi-
nese word order that is more similar to Japanese
word order, and we showed its positive impact on
translation quality.
6 Discussion and future work
In the literature, there are mainly two types of
parsers that have been used to extract sentence
structure and guide reordering. The first type cor-
responds to parsers that extract phrase structures
(i.e. HPSG parsers). These parsers infer a rich

annotation of the sentence in terms of semantic
structure or phrase heads. Other reordering strate-
gies use a different type of parsers, namely depen-
dency parsers. These parsers extract dependency
information among words in the sentence, often
consisting in the dependency relation between two
words and the type of relation (dependency label).
Reordering strategies that use syntactic infor-
mation have proved successful, but they are likely
to magnify parsing errors if their reordering rules
heavily rely on abundant parse information. This
is aggravated when reordering Chinese sentences,
due to its loose word order and large variety of
possible dependency labels.
In this work, we based our study of ordering
differences between Chinese and Japanese solely
on dependency relations and POS tags. This con-
trasts with the work in (Han et al, 2012) that re-
quires phrase structures, phrase-head information
and POS tags, and the work in (Xu et al, 2009)
that requires dependency relations, dependency la-
bels and POS tags.
In spite of the fact that our method uses less syn-
tactic information, it succeeds at reordering sen-
tences with reported speech even in presence of
punctuation symbols. It is worth saying that re-
ported speech is very common in the news domain,
which might be one of the reasons of the supe-
rior translation quality achieved by our reordering
method. Our method also accounted for ordering
differences in serial verb constructions, comple-
mentizers and adverbial modifiers, which would
have required an increase in the complexity of the
reordering logic in other methods.
To the best of our knowledge, dependency
parsers are more common than HPSG parsers
across languages, and our method can potentially
be applied to translate under-resourced languages
into other languages with a very different sentence
structure, as long as they count with dependency
parsers and reliable POS taggers.
Implementing our method for other languages
would first require a linguistic study on the re-
ordering differences between the two distant lan-
guage pairs. However, some word ordering differ-
ences might be consistent across SVO and SOV
language pairs (such as verbs going before or after
their objects), but other ordering differences may
need special treatment for the language pair under
consideration (i.e. Chinese ?bei? particles).
There are two possible directions to extend the
present work. The first one would be to refine the
current method to reduce its sensitivity to POS tag-
ging or dependency parse errors, and to extend our
linguistic study on ordering differences between
Chinese and Japanese languages. The second di-
rection would be to manually or automatically find
common patterns of ordering differences between
SVO and SOV languages. The objective would be
then to create a one-for-all reordering method that
induces monotonic word alignments between sen-
tences from distant language pairs, and that could
also be easily extended to account for the unique
characteristics of the source language of interest.
