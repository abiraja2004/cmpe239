Abstract 
The present study uses the dialogue paradigm 
to explore route communication. It revolves 
around the analysis of a corpus of route in-
structions produced in real-time interaction 
with the follower. It explores the variation in 
forming route instructions and the factors that 
contribute in it. The results show that visual 
co-presence influences the performance, con-
versation patterns and configuration of instruc-
tions. Most importantly, the results suggest an 
analogy between the choices of instruction-
givers and the communicative actions of their 
partners. 
1.1 Spatial language in dialogue 
  The main question this paper attempts to ad-
dress is how people produce route instructions in 
dialogue. The current zeitgeist in language re-
search and dialogue system development seems 
to be the unified investigation of spatial language 
and dialogue (Coventry et al, 2009). Indicative 
of the growing prioritisation of dialogue in the 
study of spatial language are the on-going re-
search efforts within the MapTask1 project and 
the GIVE challenge2 .  
1.2 A framework for the analysis of route 
instructions 
The study uses CORK (Communication of Route 
Knowledge, (Allen 2000)), a framework which 
provides a component-based analysis of route 
instructions. The CORK taxonomy differentiates 
between instructions that are directives (action 
statements with verbs of movement) and descrip-
tive statements (with state-of-being verbs, like 
?be? and ?see?). Descriptives present a static pic-

ture of spatial relations and provide the follower 
the opportunity to verify his position or reorient 
himself. The taxonomy also considers elements 
that provide specificity and distinguishing infor-
mation about environmental features, called de-
limiters. Within this framework, Allen (2000) 
describes a set of principles pertaining to the 
configuration of route descriptions. Namely, 
people concentrate descriptives and delimiters on 
points along the route that offer for uncertainty 
(like crossroads). Moreover, the selection and 
placement of these components depends on the 
characteristics of the environment and the per-
ceived needs of the follower. Evidence from em-
pirical work supports the framework, reporting 
that errors in navigation increased when the route 
directions violated these principles. Nevertheless, 
the applicability of the suggested principles has 
only been tested in scenarios in which the direc-
tions were produced beforehand by either the 
experimenters or a separate group of subjects. 
1.3 The effect of visual information  
Studies exploring the effect of visual information 
on task-oriented interaction converge on that vis-
ual feedback leads to more efficient interactions 
and influences the conversational patterns be-
tween participants (Clark and Krych, 2004; Ger-
gle et al, 2004; Koulouri and Lauria, 2009). 
These phenomena are generally attributed to the 
ease of establishing ?common ground? when 
visual feedback is available. However, to the au-
thors? knowledge, most related studies have fo-
cused on high-level analysis of dialogue acts and 
many aspects of how interlocutors adapt their 
linguistic choices remain undefined.  
1.4 Aims and hypotheses of study 
The present study provides an empirical account 
of route instructions, as they emerge in real-time 
interaction with the follower. We offer the fol-
95
lowing tentative hypotheses. Since visual co-
presence facilitates grounding of information, it 
is expected to have a major effect on how route 
instructions are configured. Next, putting addi-
tional emphasis on the inter-individual processes 
involved in language use, this study aims to test 
whether the linguistic options mobilised by the 
instructor ultimately depend upon the contribu-
tions of the follower. 
2 Methods 
A study was designed to elicit natural route in-
structions in a restricted context. Pairs of partici-
pants collaborated in a navigation task, in a ?Wi-
zard-of-Oz? set-up. The instructors provided in-
structions to navigate their partners to designated 
locations in a simulated town, being under the 
impression that they were interacting with a 
software agent (robot). The study manipulated 
two factors; i) availability of visual information 
on follower?s actions and ii), follower?s interac-
tive capacity. With regard to the first factor, there 
were two conditions in which the ability to moni-
tor the actions of the ?robot? was either removed 
or provided. The second factor also involved two 
conditions. In the first condition, the followers 
could interact using unconstrained language 
(henceforth, ?Free? condition). In the second 
condition (henceforth, ?Constrained? condition), 
a set of predetermined responses available to the 
followers aimed to coerce them towards more 
?automated? contributions; for instance, ?open-
ended? repairs such as ?What??, which provide 
no specific information on the source of the 
problem. However, the followers were still able 
to be interactive if they wished so, by clicking 
the relevant buttons to request clarification or 
provide location information.  
The study followed a between-subjects fac-
torial design. A total of 56 students were allo-
cated in the four conditions: Monitor-Free, 
Monitor-Constrained, No Monitor-Free, No 
Monitor-Constrained. The experimental proce-
dure is described in detail in (Koulouri and 
Lauria, 2009). 
2.1 Set-up 
The experiment relied on a custom-built sys-
tem which supported the interactive simulation 
and enabled real-time direct text communication 
between the pairs. The interfaces consisted of a 
graphical display and a dialogue box.  
The interface of the instructor displayed the 
full map of the simulated town (Figure 1). On the 
upper right corner of the interface, there could be 
a small ?monitor?, in which the robot?s imme-
diate locality was displayed, but not the robot 
itself. The presence of the monitor feature de-
pended on the experimental condition.   
The followers? interface displayed a fraction 
of the map, the surroundings of the robot?s cur-
rent position. The robot was operated by the fol-
lower using the arrow keys on the keyboard. In 
the ?Free? conditions followers could freely type 
messages. In the ?Constrained? conditions, the 
followers needed to use the buttons on the inter-
face (Figure 2).

2.2 Data analysis  
The analysis of the corpus of route instructions 
followed the CORK framework (Allen, 2000). 
Communicative statements were classified as 
Directives or Descriptives. These communica-
tive statements could contain references to envi-
ronmental features. The types of environmental 
features considered were: Locations (e.g., build-
ings or bridges), Pathways (e.g., streets), Choice 
Points (e.g., junctions) and Destination. Last, 
instructions can be composed of delimiters, 
which fall into four categories: 
1. Distance designations: e.g., ?...until you 
see a car park?. 
2. Direction designations: e.g., ?go left?. 
3. Relational terms: e.g., ?on your left?,  
4. Modifiers: e.g., ?big red bridge?, ?take 
the first/second/last road?.

3 Results  
The experiment yielded a large corpus of 160 
dialogues, composed of 3,386 turns. 1,485 in-
structions were collected. First, the analysis con-
siders some common measures of efficiency. 
Next, the results of the component analysis of 
instructions are presented.  
3.1 Efficiency of interaction 
The number and length of turns and instructions 
and time needed to complete each task are typi-
cally used as measures of the efficiency of inter-
action. Additionally, fewer execution and under-
standing failures are taken as indicators of supe-
rior performance. 
Time, number of turns, words and instruc-
tions: The ANOVA performed on time per task 
showed no reliable significant differences among 
groups. On the other hand, significant effects 
were observed with regard to all other dependent 
variables. An interaction effect was revealed af-
ter analysis on numbers of turns (F(1, 24) = 
3.993, p = .05). Pairs in the Monitor-Free condi-
tion required less turns to complete the task 
compared to the other groups (column 1 of Table 
1). It seems however that instructors in both 
Monitor conditions were dominating the conver-
sational floor, having produced about 58% of the 
turns, compared to instructors in the No Monitor 
conditions (F(1, 24) = 5.303, p = .03). Neverthe-
less, it was not the case that instructors in Moni-
tor conditions were ?wordier?. The number of 
words was similar among all instructor groups. 
The results indicated that the total number of 
words required to complete a task was much 
lower in Monitor conditions (F(1, 24) = = 5.215, 
p = 0.03) (see column 3 in Table 1). Next, in-
structors in Monitor conditions gave more in-
structions to guide the followers to the destina-
tion (F(1, 24) = 3.494, p = .07).  However, these 
instructions were considerably shorter compared 
to the instructions provided by No Monitor in-
structors (F(1, 24) = 4.268, p = .05). All differ-
ences are amplified in the Monitor-Constrained 
group, in which more turns and instructions were 
needed but with fewer words and the ?turn pos-
session? of the instructor was the highest among 
the groups.

Table 1. Summary of Results (mean values).  
Frequency of miscommunication: Miscom-
munication was calculated by considering two 
measures: the number of execution errors and of 
follower turns that were tagged as expressing 
non-understanding. The ANOVA revealed an 
interaction effect (F (1, 24) = 4.012, p = .05). 
Striking differences were observed between the 
Monitor-Constrained group and the rest; in par-
ticular, followers in this condition were twice or 
three times more likely to fail to understand and 
execute instructions (see last column in Table 1). 
3.2 Component analysis of instructions 
This section presents the results of the analysis 
on inclusion of landmark references, types of 
delimiters and communicative statements.  
Landmark references: Instructors in both No 
Monitor conditions preferred to produce instruc-
tions that were anchored on landmarks, especial-
ly on 3D locations such as buildings (28% of 
instructions contained locations vs 14% in the 
Monitor conditions, (F (1, 24) = 12.034, p = 
.002)). On the other hand, Monitor instructors 
opted for simple action prescriptions. Particular-
ly, 75% of the instructions in the Monitor-
Constrained condition omitted any kind of refer-
ence (compared to an average of 42% in the oth-
er conditions).  
Delimiters: Category 2 delimiters that pro-
vided simple direction information were preva-
lent in Monitor conditions (F (1, 24) = 11.407, p 
= .002). Further, an interaction effect was found 
(F (1, 24) = 3.802, p = .01); the number of cate-
gory 2 delimiters almost doubles in the Monitor-
Constrained condition. On the contrary, the use 
of category 1 delimiters, which provide informa-
tion on the boundary of the route is very limited 
in the Monitor-Constrained condition (F (1, 24) = 
5.350, p = .03). The third category of delimiters 
includes terms that specify the relation between 
traveller and an environmental feature (?on your 
left?) or between environmental features. Again, 
the difference arises in the Monitor-Constrained 
condition, which included the lowest number of 
category 3 delimiters (marginal effect, F (1, 24) 
= 3.392, p = .07). Finally, the analysis performed 
on the frequency of category 4 delimiters did not 
yield any significant effect.  
Directive and descriptive communicative 
statements: An interaction effect was revealed 
with regard to the proportion of directives and 
97
descriptives in the corpus (F (1, 24) = 3.830, p = 
.06). The instructors in the Monitor-Constrained 
condition produced less descriptives, which give 
information about relations among features in the 
environment and tap perceptual experience (?you 
will see a bridge?). In particular, in the Monitor-
Constrained condition, 4.7% of instructions were 
descriptives, whereas the proportion of descrip-
tives averaged 10% in all other conditions. 
4 Discussion 
The results resonate with previous research. The 
actions of the followers served as an immediate, 
accurate and effortless indicator of their current 
state of understanding, making verbal feedback 
redundant. Monitor instructors could readily con-
firm their assumptions about the information re-
quirements of followers and used linguistics 
shortcuts and simpler instructions exactly at the 
moment needed. On the other hand, in the No 
Monitor condition, uncertainty about the position 
and movement of the robot created the need for 
elaborate and explicit instructions. The contribu-
tion of the present study lies on that it grounds 
these observations on quantitative analysis, using 
measures like words, turns and the relative fre-
quencies of certain types of instruction compo-
nents that vary in information value. Most impor-
tantly, it describes the specific ways in which 
instructors configure their directions in the pres-
ence/absence of visual information.  
The CORK framework predicts that route pro-
tocols which are rich in descriptives and rela-
tional terms are associated with more successful 
navigation, compared to simple directional ones. 
Our results partially meet this expectation, since 
large numbers of execution errors and non-
understandings were only observed in the Moni-
tor-Constrained condition, whereas miscommu-
nication rates were similar across the other 
groups. Indeed, this condition was found to gen-
erally differ from the rest. In particular, In the 
Monitor-Constrained condition, the dialogues 
were the shortest in terms of words. Instructors 
produced many but short instructions. The com-
ponent-based analysis revealed that they em-
ployed overwhelmingly more action-based in-
structions without landmark references and de-
scriptives. Boundary information on the route, 
frame of reference and spatial relations between 
environmental features were typically omitted. In 
both Constrained conditions, followers were ex-
pected to resort to a ?mechanical? interaction, as 
coerced by the presence of the predefined re-
sponses. Inspection of the dialogues revealed that 
followers in the Monitor-Constrained condition 
did so, given the precedence of visual feedback. 
This was not the case with No Monitor-
Constrained followers who needed to verbally 
ground information. Dialogue examples are pro-
vided in Table 2 below. 
I: turn around 
I: go straight 
ahead 
I: stop 
I: turn left here 
I: go ahead 
F: What? 
I: Go straight 
ahead 
I: Now keep going down the road until 
you see a car park 
F: I am in front of the car park 
I: turn right and walk till the end,  
along the road you will see a gym on your 
right 
F: yes gym to my right side 
I: good, keep going straight and  
you will see a factory on your left 
Table 2. Dialogue excerpts from the Monitor-
Constrained (column 1) and No Monitor-Constrained 
(column 2) conditions. 
Thus, we propose that the linguistic choices of 
the followers ?prime? the instructor?s own strat-
egies. In the Monitor-Constrained Condition, 
followers were less interactive, and gave fewer 
responses with lower information value. In har-
mony, their partners provided less elaborate in-
structions, which also lacked important informa-
tion and specificity.  
In conclusion, the findings confirm our initial 
hypotheses. Instructions are sensitive to condi-
tions of (visual) co-presence. Moreover, a direct 
link was identified between the way in which 
instructions and follower?s contributions are 
formulated. Following this lead, we are now fo-
cusing on a fine-grained analysis of the utter-
ances of the follower.
