Abstract
Nowadays, most of the statistical translation sys-
tems are based on phrases (i.e. groups of words).
In this paper we study different improvements to
the standard phrase-based translation system. We
describe a modified method for the phrase extrac-
tion which deals with larger phrases while keeping
a reasonable number of phrases. We also propose
additional features which lead to a clear improve-
ment in the performance of the translation. We
present results with the EuroParl task in the direc-
tion Spanish to English and results from the evalu-
ation of the shared task ?Exploiting Parallel Texts
for Statistical Machine Translation? (ACL Work-
shop on Parallel Texts 2005).
1 Introduction
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is based on
the assumption that every sentence e in the target
language is a possible translation of a given sen-
tence f in the source language. The main difference
between two possible translations of a given sen-
tence is a probability assigned to each, which has
to be learned from a bilingual text corpus. Thus,
the translation of a source sentence f can be for-
mulated as the search of the target sentence e that
maximizes the translation probability P (e|f),
e? = argmax
e
P (e|f) (1)
0This work has been supported by the European Union
under grant FP6-506738 (TC-STAR project).
If we use Bayes rule to reformulate the transla-
tion probability, we obtain,
e? = argmax
e
P (f |e)P (e) (2)
This translation model is known as the source-
channel approach [1] and it consists on a lan-
guage model P (e) and a separate translation model
P (f |e) [5].
In the last few years, new systems tend to use
sequences of words, commonly called phrases [8],
aiming at introducing word context in the transla-
tion model. As alternative to the source-channel
approach the decision rule can be modeled through
a log-linear maximum entropy framework.
e? = argmax
e
{ M
?
m=1
?mhm(e, f)
}
(3)
The features functions, hm, are the system mod-
els (translation model, language model and others)
and weigths, ?i, are typically optimized to max-
imize a scoring function. It is derived from the
Maximum Entropy approach suggested by [13] [14]
for a natural language understanding task. It has
the advantatge that additional features functions
can be easily integrated in the overall system.
This paper addresses a modification of the
phrase-extraction algorythm in [11]. It also com-
bines several interesting features and it reports an
important improvement from the baseline. It is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 introduces the base-
line; the following section explains the modification
in the phrase extraction; section 4 shows the differ-
ent features which have been taken into account;
section 5 presents the evaluation framework; and
149
the final section shows some conclusions on the ex-
periments in the paper and on the results in the
shared task.
2 Baseline
The baseline is based on the source-channel ap-
proach, and it is composed of the following models
which later will be combined in the decoder.
The Translation Model. It is based on bilin-
gual phrases, where a bilingual phrase (BP ) is
simply two monolingual phrases (MP ) in which
each one is supposed to be the translation of each
other. A monolingual phrase is a sequence of words.
Therefore, the basic idea of phrase-based transla-
tion is to segment the given source sentence into
phrases, then translate each phrase and finally com-
pose the target sentence from these phrase transla-
tions [17].
During training, the system has to learn a dictio-
nary of phrases. We begin by aligning the training
corpus using GIZA++ [6], which is done in both
translation directions. We take the union of both
alignments to obtain a symmetrized word align-
ment matrix. This alignment matrix is the starting
point for the phrase based extraction.
Next, we define the criterion to extract the set of
BP of the sentence pair (f j2j1 ; e
i2
i1) and the alignment
matrix A ? J?I , which is identical to the alignment
criterion described in [11].
BP (fJ1 , eI1, A) = {(f j2j1 , e
i2
i1) :
?(j, i)?A : j1 ? j ? j2 ? i1 ? i ? i2
??(j, i)?A : j1 ? j ? j2 ? i1 ? i ? i2}
The set of BP is consistent with the alignment
and consists of all BP pairs where all words within
the foreign language phrase are only aligned to the
words of the English language phrase and viceversa.
At least one word in the foreign language phrase has
to be aligned with at least one word of the English
language. Finally, the algorithm takes into account
possibly unaligned words at the boundaries of the
foreign or English language phrases.
The target language model. It is combined
with the translation probability as showed in equa-
tion (2). It gives coherence to the target text ob-
tained by the concatenated phrases.
3 Phrase Extraction
Motivation. The length of a MP is defined as
its number of words. The length of a BP is the
greatest of the lengths of its MP .
As we are working with a huge amount of data
(see corpus statistics), it is unfeasible to build a
dictionary with all the phrases longer than length
4. Moreover, the huge increase in computational
and storage cost of including longer phrases does
not provide a significant improve in quality [8].
X-length In our system we considered two length
limits. We first extract all the phrases of length 3
or less. Then, we also add phrases up to length
5 if they cannot be generated by smaller phrases.
Empirically, we chose 5, as the probability of reap-
pearence of larger phrases decreases.
Basically, we select additional phrases with
source words that otherwise would be missed be-
cause of cross or long alignments. For example,
from the following sentence,
Cuando el Parlamento Europeo , que tan fre-
cuentemente insiste en los derechos de los traba-
jadores y en la debida proteccio?n social , (...)
NULL ( ) When ( 1 ) the ( 2 ) European ( 4
) Parliament ( 3 4 ) , ( 5 ) that ( 6 ) so ( 7 )
frequently ( 8 ) insists ( 9 ) on ( 10 ) workers ( 11
15 ) ? ( 14 ) rights ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) proper ( 19 )
social ( 21 ) protection ( 20 ) , ( 22 ) (...)
where the number inside the clauses is the
aligned word(s). And the phrase that we are look-
ing for is the following one.
los derechos de los trabajadores # workers ?
rights
which only could appear in the case the maximum
length was 5.
150
4 Phrase ranking
4.1 Conditional probability P (f |e)
Given the collected phrase pairs, we estimated the
phrase translation probability distribution by rela-
tive frecuency.
P (f |e) = N(f, e)N(e) (4)
where N(f,e) means the number of times the phrase
f is translated by e. If a phrase e has N > 1
possible translations, then each one contributes as
1/N [17].
Note that no smoothing is performed, which may
cause an overestimation of the probability of rare
phrases. This is specially harmful given a BP
where the source part has a big frecuency of ap-
pearence but the target part appears rarely. For
example, from our database we can extract the fol-
lowing BP : ?you # la que no?, where the English
is the source language and the Spanish, the tar-
get language. Clearly, ?la que no? is not a good
translation of ?you?, so this phrase should have a
low probability. However, from our aligned training
database we obtain,
P (f |e) = P (you|la que no) = 0.23
This BP is clearly overestimated due to sparse-
ness. On the other, note that ?la que no? can-
not be considered an unusual trigram in Spanish.
Hence, the language model does not penalise this
target sequence either. So, the total probability
(P (f |e)P (e)) would be higher than desired.
In order to somehow compensate these unreili-
able probabilities we have studied the inclusion of
the posterior [12] and lexical probabilities [1] [10]
as additional features.
4.2 Feature P (e|f)
In order to estimate the posterior phrase probabil-
ity, we compute again the relative frequency but re-
placing the count of the target phrase by the count
of the source phrase.
P (e|f) = N
?(f, e)
N(f) (5)
where N?(f,e) means the number of times the
phrase e is translated by f. If a phrase f has N > 1
possible translations, then each one contributes as
1/N.
Adding this feature function we reduce the num-
ber of cases in which the overall probability is over-
estimated. This results in an important improve-
ment in translation quality.
4.3 IBM Model 1
We used IBM Model 1 to estimate the probability
of a BP . As IBM Model 1 is a word translation and
it gives the sum of all possible alignment probabil-
ities, a lexical co-ocurrence effect is expected. This
captures a sort of semantic coherence in transla-
tions.
Therefore, the probability of a sentence pair is
given by the following equation.
P (f |e; M1) = 1(I + 1)J
J
?
j=1
I
?
i=0
p(fj |ei) (6)
The p(fj |ei) are the source-target IBM Model 1
word probabilities trained by GIZA++. Because
the phrases are formed from the union of source-to-
target and target-to-source alignments, there can
be words that are not in the P (fj |ei) table. In this
case, the probability was taken to be 10?40.
In addition, we have calculated the IBM?1 Model
1.
P (e|f ; M1) = 1(J + 1)I
I
?
I=1
J
?
j=0
p(ei|fj) (7)
4.4 Language Model
The English language model plays an important
role in the source channel model, see equation (2),
and also in its modification, see equation (3). The
English language model should give an idea of the
sentence quality that is generated.
As default language model feature, we use a stan-
dard word-based trigram language model generated
with smoothing Kneser-Ney and interpolation (by
using SRILM [16]).
4.5 Word and Phrase Penalty
To compensate the preference of the target lan-
guage model for shorter sentences, we added two
151

Train Sentences 1223443 1223443
Words 34794006 33379333
Vocabulary 168685 104975

Test Sentences 504 504
Words 10305 10667
OOV 36 19
Table 1: Statistics of training and test corpus
simple features which are widely used [17] [7]. The
word penalty provides means to ensure that the
translations do not get too long or too short. Neg-
ative values for the word penalty favor longer out-
put, positive values favor shorter output [7].
The phrase penalty is a constant cost per pro-
duced phrase. Here, a negative weight, which
means reducing the costs per phrase, results in a
preference for adding phrases. Alternatively, by us-
ing a positive scaling factors, the system will favor
less phrases.
5 Evaluation framework
5.1 Corpus Statistics
Experiments were performed to study the effect
of our modifications in the phrases. The training
material covers the transcriptions from April 1996
to September 2004. This material has been dis-
tributed by the European Parlament. In our ex-
periments, we have used the distribution of RWTH
of Aachen under the project of TC-STAR 1. The
test material was used in the first evaluation of the
project in March 2005. In our case, we have used
the development divided in two sets. This mate-
rial corresponds to the transcriptions of the sessions
from October the 21st to October the 28th. It has
been distributed by ELDA2. Results are reported
for Spanish-to-English translations.

5.2 Experiments
The decoder used for the presented translation sys-
tem is reported in [2]. This decoder is called
MARIE and it takes into account simultaneously
all the 7 features functions described above. It im-
plements a beam-search strategy.
As evaluation criteria we use: the Word Error
Rate (WER), the BLEU score [15] and the NIST
score [3].
As follows we report the results for several ex-
periments that show the performance of: the base-
line, adding the posterior probability, IBM Model
1 and IBM1?1, and, finally, the modification of the
phrases extraction.
Optimisation. Significant improvements can be
obtained by tuning the parameters of the features
adequately. In the complet system we have 7 pa-
rameters to tune: the relatives frecuencies P (f |e)
and P (e|f), IBM Model 1 and its inverse, the word
penalty, the phrase penalty and the weight of the
language model. We applied the widely used algo-
rithm SIMPLEX to optimise [9]. In Table 2 (line
5th), we see the final results.
Baseline. We report the results of the baseline.
We use the union alignment and we extract the
BP of length 3. As default language model fea-
ture, we use the standard trigram with smoothing
Kneser-Ney and interpolation. Also we tune the
parameters (only two parameters) with the SIM-
PLEX algorithm (see Table 2).
Posterior probability. Table 2 shows the effect
of using the posterior probability: P (e|f). We use
all the features but the P (e|f) and we optimise the
parameters. We see the results without this feature
decrease around 1.1 points both in BLEU and WER
(see line 2rd and 5th in Table 2).
IBM Model 1. We do the same as in the para-
graph above, we do not consider the IBM Model
1 and the IBM1?1. Under these conditions, the
translation?s quality decreases around 1.3 points
both in BLEU and WER (see line 3th and 5th in
Table 2).
152
Modification of the Phrase Extraction. Fi-
nally, we made an experiment without modification
of the phrases? length. We can see the comparison
between: (1) the phrases of fixed maximum length
of 3; and (2) including phrases with a maximum
length of 5 which can not be generated by smaller
phrases. We can see it in Table 2 (lines 4th and
5th). We observe that there is no much difference
between the number of phrases, so this approach
does not require more resources. However, we get
slightly better scores.
5.3 Shared Task
This section explains the participation of ?Exploit-
ing Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine Transla-
tion?. We used the EuroParl data provided for this
shared task [4]. A word-to-word alignment was per-
formed in both directions as explained in section
2. The phrase-based translation system which has
been considered implements a total of 7 features
(already explained in section 4). Notice that the
language model has been trained with the training
provided in the shared task. However, the opti-
mization in the parameters has not been repeated,
and we used the parameters obtained in the sub-
section above. We have obtained the results in the
Table 3.
6 Conclusions
We reported a new method to extract longer
phrases without increasing the quantity of phrases
(less than 0.5%).
We also reported several features as P (e|f)
which in combination with the functions of the
source-channel model provides significant improve-
ment. Also, the feature IBM1 in combination with
IBM1?1 provides improved scores, too.
Finally, we have optimized the parameters, and
we provided the final results which have been pre-
sented in the Shared Task: Exploiting Parallel
Texts for Statistical Machine Translation (June 30,
2005) in conjunction with ACL 2005 in Ann Arbor,
Michigan.
