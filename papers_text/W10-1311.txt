Abstract
Modern automatic speech recognition is inef-
fective at understanding relatively unintelligi-
ble speech caused by neuro-motor disabilities
collectively called dysarthria. Since dysarthria
is primarily an articulatory phenomenon, we
are collecting a database of vocal tract mea-
surements during speech of individuals with
cerebral palsy. In this paper, we demonstrate
that articulatory knowledge can remove am-
biguities in the acoustics of dysarthric speak-
ers by reducing entropy relatively by 18.3%,
on average. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that dysarthric speech is more precisely por-
trayed as a noisy-channel distortion of an
abstract representation of articulatory goals,
rather than as a distortion of non-dysarthric
speech. We discuss what implications these
results have for our ongoing development of
speech systems for dysarthric speakers.
1 Introduction
Dysarthria is a set of congenital and traumatic
neuro-motor disorders that impair the physical pro-
duction of speech and affects approximately 0.8% of
individuals in North America (Hosom et al, 2003).
Causes of dysarthria include cerebral palsy (CP),
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson?s disease, and amy-
otrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These impairments
reduce or remove normal control of the primary vo-
cal articulators but do not affect the abstract produc-
tion of meaningful, syntactically correct language.
The neurological origins of dysarthria involve
damage to the cranial nerves that control the speech
articulators (Moore and Dalley, 2005). Spastic
dysarthria, for instance, is partially caused by le-
sions in the facial and hypoglossal nerves, which
control the jaw and tongue respectively (Duffy,
2005), resulting in slurred speech and a less differ-
entiable vowel space (Kent and Rosen, 2004). Sim-
ilarly, damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can re-
duce control over vocal fold vibration (i.e., phona-
tion), resulting in guttural or grating raspiness. In-
adequate control of the soft palate caused by disrup-
tion of the vagus nerve may lead to a disproportion-
ate amount of air released through the nose during
speech (i.e., hypernasality).
Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech
recognition (ASR) is incompatible with dysarthric
speech, often rendering such software inaccessible
to those whose neuro-motor disabilities might make
other forms of interaction (e.g., keyboards, touch
screens) laborious. Traditional representations in
ASR such as hidden Markov models (HMMs)
trained for speaker independence that achieve
84.8% word-level accuracy for non-dysarthric
speakers might achieve less than 4.5% accuracy
given severely dysarthric speech on short sentences
(Rudzicz, 2007). Our research group is currently
developing new ASR models that incorporate em-
pirical knowledge of dysarthric articulation for use
in assistive applications (Rudzicz, 2009). Although
these models have increased accuracy, the disparity
is still high. Our aim is to understand why ASR
fails for dysarthric speakers by understanding the
acoustic and articulatory nature of their speech.
In this paper, we cast the speech-motor interface
within the mathematical framework of the noisy-
channel model. This is motivated by the charac-
80
terization of dysarthria as a distortion of parallel
biological pathways that corrupt motor signals be-
fore execution (Kent and Rosen, 2004; Freund et
al., 2005), as in the examples cited above. Within
this information-theoretic framework, we aim to in-
fer the nature of the motor signal distortions given
appropriate measurements of the vocal tract. That is,
we ask the following question: Is dysarthric speech
a distortion of typical speech, or are they both distor-
tions of some common underlying representation?
2 Dysarthric articulation data
Since the underlying articulatory dynamics of
dysarthric speech are intrinsically responsible for
complex acoustic irregularities, we are collecting
a database of dysarthric articulation. Time-aligned
movement and acoustic data are measured using
two systems. The first infers 3D positions of sur-
face facial markers given stereo video images. The
second uses electromagnetic articulography (EMA),
in which the speaker is placed within a cube that
produces a low-amplitude electromagnetic field, as
shown in figure 1. Tiny sensors within this field al-
low the inference of articulator positions and veloci-
ties to within 1 mm of error (Yunusova et al, 2009).
Figure 1: Electromagnetic articulograph system.
We have so far recorded one male speaker with
ALS, five male speakers with CP, four female
speakers with CP, and age- and gender-matched
controls. Measurement coils are placed as in
other studies (e.g., the University of Edinburgh?s
MOCHA database (Wrench, 1999) and the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison?s x-ray microbeam
database (Yunusova et al, 2008)). Specifically, we
are interested in the positions of the upper and lower
lip (UL and LL), left and right mouth corners (LM
and RM), lower incisor (LI), and tongue tip, blade,
and dorsum (TT, TB, and TD). Unfortunately, a few
of our male CP subjects had a severe gag reflex, and
we found it impossible to place more than one coil
on the tongue for these few individuals. Therefore,
of the tongue positions, only TT is used in this study.
All articulatory data are smoothed with third-order
median filtering in order to minimize measurement
?jitter?. Figure 2 shows the degree of lip aperture
(i.e., the distance between UL and LL) over time for
a control and a dysarthric speaker repeating the se-
quence /ah p iy/. Here, the dysarthric speech is no-
tably slower and has more excessive movement.

Our dysarthric speech data include random repeti-
tions of phonetically balanced short sentences origi-
nally used in the TIMIT database (Zue et al, 1989),
as well as pairs of monosyllabic words identified
by Kent et al (1989) as having relevant articula-
tory contrasts (e.g., beat versus meat as a stop-
nasal contrast). All articulatory data are aligned
with associated acoustic data, which are transformed
to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
Phoneme boundaries and pronunciation errors are
being transcribed by a speech-language pathologist
to the TIMIT phoneset. Table 1 shows pronuncia-
tion errors according to manner of articulation for
dysarthric speech. Plosives are mispronounced most
often, with substitution errors exclusively caused by
errant voicing (e.g. /d/ for /t/). By comparison, only
81
5% of corresponding plosives in total are mispro-
nounced in regular speech. Furthermore, the preva-
lence of deleted affricates in word-final positions, al-
most all of which are alveolar, does not occur in the
corresponding control data.

3 Entropy and the noisy-channel model
We wish to measure the degree of statistical disorder
in both acoustic and articulatory data for dysarthric
and non-dysarthric speakers, as well as the a posteri-
ori disorder of one type of data given the other. This
quantification will inform us as to the relative mer-
its of incorporating knowledge of articulatory be-
haviour into ASR systems for dysarthric speakers.
Entropy, H(X), is a measure of the degree of uncer-
tainty in a random variable X . When X is discrete,
this value is computed with the familiar
H(X) =?
n
?
i=1
p(xi) logb p(xi),
where b is the logarithm base, xi is a value of X ,
of which there are n possible, and p(xi) is its prob-
ability. When our observations are continuous, as
they are in our acoustic and articulatory database,
we must use differential entropy defined by
H(X) =?
?
X
f (X) log f (X)dX ,
where f (X) is the probability density function of X .
For a number of distributions f (X), the differential
entropy has known forms (Lazo and Rathie, 1978).
For example, if f (X) is a multivariate normal,
fX(x1, ...,xN) =
exp

)

H(X) = 12 ln

where ? and ? are the mean and covariances of the
data. However, since we observe that both acous-
tic and articulatory data follow non-Gaussian dis-
tributions, we choose to represent these spaces by
mixtures of Gaussians. Huber et al (2008) have de-
veloped an accurate algorithm for estimating differ-
ential entropy of Gaussian mixtures based on itera-
tively merging Gaussians and the approximation
H?(X) =
L
?
i=1
?i
(
? log?i + 12 log((2pie)
N |?i|
)
,
where ?i is the weight of the ith(1? i? L) Gaussian
and ?i is that Gaussian?s covariance matrix. This
method is used to approximate entropies in the fol-
lowing study, with L = 32. Note that while differen-
tial entropies can be negative and not invariant under
82
change of variables, other properties of entropy are
retained (Huber et al, 2008), such as the chain rule
for conditional entropy
H(Y |X) = H(Y,X)?H(X),
which describes the uncertainty in Y given knowl-
edge of X , and the chain rule for mutual information
I(Y ;X) = H(X)+H(Y )?H(X ,Y ),
which describes the mutual dependence between X
and Y . Here, we quantize entropy with the nat,
which is the natural logarithmic unit, e (? 1.44 bits).
3.1 The noisy channel
The noisy-channel theorem states that information
passed through a channel with capacity C at a rate
R ? C can be reliably recovered with an arbitrarily
low probability of error given an appropriate coding.
Here, a message from a finite alphabet is encoded,
producing signal x ? X . That signal is then distorted
by a medium which transmits signal y ? Y accord-
ing to some distribution P(Y |X). Given that there is
some probability that the received signal, y, is cor-
rupted, the message produced by the decoder may
differ from the original (Shannon, 1949).
To what extent can we describe the effects of
dysarthria within an information-theoretic noisy
channel model? We pursue two competing hypothe-
ses within this general framework. The first hypoth-
esis models the assumption that dysarthric speech is
a distorted version of typical speech. Here, signal
X and Y represent the vocal characteristics of the
general and dysarthric populations, respectively, and
P(Y |X) models the distortion between them. The
second hypothesis models the assumption that both
dysarthric and typical speech are distorted versions
of some common abstraction. Here, Yd and Yc repre-
sent the vocal characteristics of dysarthric and con-
trol speakers, respectively, and X represents a com-
mon, underlying mechanism and that P(Yd |X) and
P(Yc |X) model distortions from that mechanism.
These two hypotheses are visualized in figure 3. In
each of these cases, signals can be acoustic, articu-
latory, or some combination thereof.
3.2 Common underlying abstractions

and control speakers share a common high-level ab-

straction of the vocal tract that is in both cases dis-
torted during articulation, we incorporate the the-
ory of task dynamics (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989).
This theory represents the interface between the lex-
ical intentions and vocal tract realizations of speech
as a sequence of overlapping gestures, which are
continuous dynamical systems that describe goal-
oriented reconfigurations of the vocal tract, such as
bilabial closure during /m/. Figure 4 shows an ex-
ample of overlapping gestures for the word pub.

discretized goals, such as lip closure. Black curves repre-
sent the output of the TADA system.
The open-source TADA system (Nam and Gold-
stein, 2006) estimates the positions of various artic-
ulators during speech according to parameters that
have been carefully tuned by the authors of TADA
according to a generic, speaker-independent repre-
sentation of the vocal tract (Saltzman and Munhall,
1989). Given a word sequence and a syllable-to-
gesture dictionary, TADA produces the continuous
83
tract variable paths that are necessary to produce that
sequence. This takes into account various physio-
logical aspects of human speech production, such as
interarticulator co-ordination and timing (Nam and
Saltzman, 2003).
In this study, we use TADA to produce estimates
of a global, high-level representation of speech com-
mon to both dysarthric and non-dysarthric speakers
alike. Given a word sequence uttered by both types
of speaker, we produce five continuous curves pre-
scribed by that word sequence in order to match our
available EMA data. Those curves are lip aperture
and protrusion (LA and LP), tongue tip constriction
location and degree (TTCL and TTCD, representing
front-back and top-down positions of the tongue tip,
respectively), and lower incisor height (LIH). These
curves are then compared against actually observed
EMA data, as described below.
4 Experiments
First, in section 4.1, we ask whether the incorpo-
ration of articulatory data is theoretically useful in
reducing uncertainty in dysarthric speech. Second,
in section 4.2, we ask which of the two noisy chan-
nel models in figure 3 best describe the observed be-
haviour of dysarthric speech.
Data for this study are collected as described as in
section 2. Here, we use data from three dysarthric
speakers with cerebral palsy (males M01 and M04,
and female F03), as well as their age- and gender-
matched counterparts from the general population
(males MC01 and MC03, and female FC02). For
this study we restrict our analysis to 100 phrases ut-
tered in common by all six speakers.
4.1 Entropy
We measure the differential entropy of acoustics
(H(Ac)), of articulation (H(Ar)), and of acoustics
given knowledge of the vocal tract (H(Ac |Ar)) in
order to obtain theoretical estimates as to the utility
of articulatory data. Table 3 shows these quantities
across the six speakers in this study. As expected,
the acoustics of dysarthric speakers are much more
disordered than for non-dysarthric speakers. One
unexpected finding is that there is very little differ-
ence between speakers in terms of their entropy of
articulation. Although dysarthric speakers clearly
lack articulatory dexterity, this implies that they
nonetheless articulate with a level of consistency
similar to their non-dysarthric counterparts1. How-
ever, the equivocation H(Ac |Ar) is an order of mag-
nitude lower for non-dysarthric speakers. This im-
plies that there is very little ambiguity left in the
acoustics of non-dysarthric speakers if we have si-
multaneous knowledge of the vocal tract, but that
quite a bit of ambiguity remains for our dysarthric
speakers, despite significant reductions.

Table 4 shows the average mutual information be-
tween acoustics and articulation for each type of
speaker, given knowledge of the phonological man-
ner of articulation. In table 1 we noted a prevalence
of pronunciation errors among dysarthric speakers
for plosives, but table 4 shows no particularly low
congruity between acoustics and articulation for this
manner of phoneme. Those pronunciation errors
tended to be voicing errors, which would involve the
glottis, which is not measured in this study.
Table 4 appears to imply that there is little mu-
tual information between acoustics and articulation
in vowels across all speakers. However, this is al-
most certainly the result of our exclusion of tongue
blade and tongue dorsum measurements in order to
standardize across speakers who could not manage
these sensors. Indeed, the configuration of the en-
tire tongue is known to be useful in discriminat-
ing among the vowels (O?Shaughnessy, 2000). An
ad hoc analysis including all three tongue sensors
for speakers F03, MC01, MC03, and FC02 revealed
mutual information between acoustics and articula-

tion of 16.81 nats for F03 and 18.73 nats for the
control speakers, for vowels. This is compared with
mutual information of 11.82 nats for F03 and 13.88
nats for the control speakers across all other man-
ners. The trend seems to be that acoustics are better
predicted given more tongue measurements.
In order to better understand these results, we
compare the distributions of the vowels in acoustic
space across dysarthric and non-dysarthric speech.
Vowels in acoustic space are characterized by the
steady-state positions of the first two formants (F1
and F2) as determined automatically by applying the
pre-emphasized Burg algorithm (Press et al, 1992).
We fit Gaussians to the first two formants for each
of the vowels in our data, as exemplified in fig-
ure 5 and compute the entropy within these distri-
butions. Surprisingly, the entropies of these distri-
butions were relatively consistent across dysarthric
(34.6 nats) and non-dysarthric (33.3 nats) speech,
with some exceptions (e.g., iy). However, vowel
spaces overlap considerably more in the dysarthric
case signifying that, while speakers with CP can be
nearly as acoustically consistent as non-dysarthric
speakers, their targets in that space are not as dis-
cernible. Some research has shown larger variance
among dysarthric vowels relative to our findings
(Kain et al, 2007). This may partially be due to our
use of natural connected speech as data, rather than
restrictive consonant-vowel-consonant non-words.
4.2 Noisy channel
Our task is to determine whether dysarthric speech
is best represented as a distorted version of typi-
cal speech, or if both dysarthric and typical speech
ought to be viewed as distortions of a common ab-

stract representation. To explore this question, we
design a transformation system that produces the
most likely observation in one data space given its
counterpart in another and the statistical relationship
between the two spaces. This transformation in ef-
fect implements the noisy channel itself.
To accomplish this, we learn probability distri-
butions over our EMA data. First, we collect all
dysarthric data together and all non-dysarthric data
together. We then consider the acoustic (Ac) and
articulatory (Ar) subsets of these data. In each
case, we train Gaussian mixtures, each with 60 com-
ponents, over 90% of the data in both dysarthric
and non-dysarthric speech. Here, each of the 60
phonemes in the data is represented by one Gaussian
component, with the weight of that component de-
termined by the relative proportion of 10 ms frames
for that phoneme. Similarly, all training word se-
quences are passed to TADA, and we train a mixture
of Gaussians on its articulatory output.
Across all Gaussian mixtures, we end up with 5
Gaussians tuned to various aspects of each phoneme
p: its dysarthric acoustics and articulation (NAcp (Yd)
and NArp (Yd)), its control acoustics and articula-
tion (NAcp (Yd) and N
Ar
p (Yd)), and its prescribed ar-
ticulation from TADA (NArp (X)). Each Gaussian
NAp(B) is represented by its mean ?
(A,B)
p and its
85
covariance, ?(A,B)p . Furthermore, we compute the
cross-covariance matrix between Gaussians for a
given phoneme (e.g., ?(Ac,Yc)?(Ac,Yd)p is the cross-
covariance matrix of the acoustics of the control (Yc)
and dysarthric (Yd) speech for phoneme p). Given
these parameters, we estimate the most likely frame
in one domain given its counterpart in another. For
example, if we are given a frame of acoustics from
a control speaker, we can synthesize the most likely
frame of acoustics for a dysarthric speaker, given an
application of the noisy channel proposed by Hosom
et al (2003) used to transform dysarthric speech to
make it more intelligible. Namely, given a frame of
acoustics yc from a control speaker, we can estimate
the acoustics of a dysarthric speaker yd with:

where ?p is the proportion of the frames of phoneme

and sources of data is accomplished merely by sub-
stituting in the appropriate Gaussians above.
We now measure how closely the transformed
data spaces match their true target spaces. In each
case, we transform test utterances (recorded, or syn-
thesized with TADA) according to functions learned
in training (i.e., we use the remaining 10% of the
data for each speaker type). These transformed
spaces are then compared against their target space
in our data. Table 5 shows the Gaussian mixture

various types of source and target data, weighted by
the relative proportions of the phonemes. Each pair

Our baseline shows that control and dysarthric
speakers differ far more in their acoustics than in
their articulation. When our control data (both
acoustic and articulatory) are transformed to match
the dysarthric data, the result is predictably more
similar to the latter than if the conversion had not
taken place. This corresponds to the noisy channel
model of figure 3(a), whereby dysarthric speech is
modelled as a distortion of non-dysarthric speech.
However, when we model dysarthric and control
speech as distortions of a common, abstract repre-
sentation (i.e., task dynamics) as in figure 3(b), the
resulting synthesized articulatory spaces are more
similar to their respective observed data than the
articulation predicted by the first noisy channel
model. Dysarthric articulation predicted by trans-
formations from task-dynamics space differ signifi-
cantly from those predicted by transformations from
control EMA data at the 95% confidence interval.
5 Discussion
This paper demonstrates a few acoustic and articu-
latory features in speakers with cerebral palsy. First,
these speakers are likely to mistakenly voice un-
voiced plosives, and to delete fricatives regardless of
their word position. We suggest that it might be pru-
dent to modify the vocabularies of ASR systems to
account for these expected mispronunciations. Sec-
ond, dysarthric speakers produce sonorants signifi-
cantly slower than their non-dysarthric counterparts.
86
This may present an increase in insertion errors in
ASR systems (Rosen and Yampolsky, 2000).
Although not quantified in this paper, we detect
that a lack of articulatory control can often lead
to observable acoustic consequences. For example,
our dysarthric data contain considerable involuntary
types of velopharyngeal or glottal noise (often as-
sociated with respiration), audible swallowing, and
stuttering. We intend to work towards methods of
explicitly identifying regions of non-speech noise in
our ASR systems for dysarthric speakers.
We have considered the amount of statistical dis-
order (i.e., entropy) in both acoustic and articula-
tory data in dysarthric and non-dysarthric speak-
ers. The use of articulatory knowledge reduces the
degree of this disorder significantly for dysarthric
speakers (18.3%, relatively), though far less than for
non-dysarthric speakers (86.2%, relatively). In real-
world applications we are not likely to have access to
measurements of the vocal tract; however, many ap-
proaches exist that estimate the configuration of the
vocal tract given only acoustic data (Richmond et al,
2003; Toda et al, 2008), often to an average error of
less than 1 mm. The generalizability of such work
to new speakers (particularly those with dysarthria)
without training is an open research question.
We have argued for noisy channel models of
the neuro-motor interface assuming that the path-
way of motor command to motor activity is a lin-
ear sequence of dynamics. The biological reality
is much more complicated. In particular, the path-
way of verbal motor commands includes several
sources of sensory feedback (Seikel et al, 2005) that
modulate control parameters during speech (Gracco,
1995). These senses include exteroceptive stimuli
(auditory and tactile), and interoceptive stimuli (par-
ticularly proprioception and its kinesthetic sense)
(Seikel et al, 2005), the disruption of which can lead
to a number of production changes. For instance,
Abbs et al (1976) showed that when conduction in
the mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve is
blocked, the resulting speech has considerably more
pronunciation errors, although is generally intelligi-
ble. Barlow (1989) argues that the redundancy of
sensory messages provides the necessary input to the
motor planning stage, which relates abstract goals to
motor activity in the cerebellum. As we continue to
develop our articulatory ASR models for dysarthric
speakers, one potential avenue for future research in-
volves the incorporation of feedback from the cur-
rent state of the vocal tract to the motor planning
phase. This would be similar, in premise, to the
DIVA model (Guenther and Perkell, 2004).
In the past, we have shown that ASR systems that
adapt non-dysarthric acoustic models to dysarthric
data offer improved word-accuracy rates, but with
a clear upper bound approximately 75% below the
general population (Rudzicz, 2007). Incorporat-
ing articulatory knowledge into such adaptation im-
proved accuracy further, but with accuracy still
approximately 60% below the general population
(Rudzicz, 2009). In this paper, we have demon-
strated that dysarthric articulation can be more ac-
curately represented as a distortion of an underlying
model of abstract speech goals than as a distortion of
non-dysarthric articulation. These results will guide
our continued development of speech systems aug-
mented with articulatory knowledge, particularly the
incorporation of task dynamics.
