Abstract 
In this paper, we describe the development 
and performance of the supervised system 
UMCC_DLSI-(SA). This system uses corpora 
where phrases are annotated as Positive, 
Negative, Objective, and Neutral, to achieve 
new sentiment resources involving word 
dictionaries with their associated polarity. As 
a result, new sentiment inventories are 
obtained and applied in conjunction with 
detected informal patterns, to tackle the 
challenges posted in Task 2b of the Semeval-
2013 competition. Assessing the effectiveness 
of our application in sentiment classification, 
we obtained a 69% F-Measure for neutral and 
an average of 43% F-Measure for positive 
and negative using Tweets and SMS 
messages. 
1 Introduction 
Textual information has become one of the most 
important sources of data to extract useful and 
heterogeneous knowledge from. Texts can provide 
factual information, such as: descriptions, lists of 
characteristics, or even instructions to opinion-
based information, which would include reviews, 
emotions, or feelings. These facts have motivated 
dealing with the identification and extraction of 
opinions and sentiments in texts that require 
special attention.  
Many researchers, such as (Balahur et al, 2010; 
Hatzivassiloglou et al, 2000; Kim and Hovy, 
2006; Wiebe et al, 2005) and many others have 
been working on this and related areas. 
Related to assessment Sentiment Analysis (SA) 
systems, some international competitions have 
taken place. Some of those include: Semeval-2010 
(Task 18: Disambiguating Sentiment Ambiguous 
Adjectives 1 ) NTCIR (Multilingual Opinion 
Analysis Task (MOAT 2)) TASS 3  (Workshop on 
Sentiment Analysis at SEPLN workshop) and 
Semeval-2013 (Task 2 4  Sentiment Analysis in 
Twitter) (Kozareva et al, 2013). 
In this paper, we introduce a system for Task 2 
b) of the Semeval-2013 competition. 
1.1 Task 2 Description 
In participating in ?Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in 
Twitter? of Semeval-2013, the goal was to take a 
given message and its topic and classify whether it 
had a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment 
towards the topic. For messages conveying, both a 
positive and negative sentiment toward the topic, 
the stronger sentiment of the two would end up as 
the classification. Task 2 included two sub-tasks. 
Our team focused on Task 2 b), which provides 
two training corpora as described in Table 3, and 
two test corpora: 1) sms-test-input-B.tsv (with 
2094 SMS) and 2) twitter-test-input-B.tsv (with 
3813 Twit messages). 
The following section shows some background 
approaches. Subsequently, in section 3, we 
describe the UMCC_DLSI-(SA) system that was 
used in Task 2 b). Section 4 describes the 
assessment of the obtained resource from the 
Sentiment Classification task. Finally, the 
conclusion and future works are presented in 
section 5. 
2 Background 
The use of sentiment resources has proven to be a 
necessary step for training and evaluating  systems 
that implement sentiment analysis, which also

include fine-grained opinion mining (Balahur, 
2011). 
In order to build sentiment resources, several 
studies have been conducted. One of the first is the 
relevant work by (Hu and Liu, 2004) using lexicon 
expansion techniques by adding synonymy and 
antonym relations provided by WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al, 1990) Another one 
is the research described by (Hu and Liu, 2004; 
Liu et al, 2005) which obtained an Opinion 
Lexicon compounded by a list of positive and 
negative opinion words or sentiment words for 
English (around 6800 words). 
A similar approach has been used for building 
WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) 
which expands six basic categories of emotion; 
thus, increasing the lexicon paths in WordNet. 
Nowadays, many sentiment and opinion 
messages are provided by Social Media. To deal 
with the informalities presented in these sources, it 
is necessary to have intermediary systems that 
improve the level of understanding of the 
messages. The following section offers a 
description of this phenomenon and a tool to track 
it. 
2.1 Text normalization 
Several informal features are present in opinions 
extracted from Social Media texts. Some research 
has been conducted in the field of lexical 
normalization for this kind of text. TENOR 
(Mosquera and Moreda, 2012) is a multilingual 
text normalization tool for Web 2.0 texts with an 
aim to transform noisy and informal words into 
their canonical form. That way, they can be easily 
processed by NLP tools and applications. TENOR 
works by identifying out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
words such as slang, informal lexical variants, 
expressive lengthening, or contractions using a 
dictionary lookup and replacing them by matching 
formal candidates in a word lattice using phonetic 
and lexical edit distances. 
2.2 Construction of our own Sentiment 
Resource  
Having analyzed the examples of SA described in 
section 2, we proposed building our own sentiment 
resource (Guti?rrez et al, 2013) by adding lexical 
and informal patterns to obtain classifiers that can 
deal with Task 2b of Semeval-2013. We proposed 
the use of a method named RA-SR (using Ranking 
Algorithms to build Sentiment Resources) 
(Guti?rrez et al, 2013) to build sentiment word 
inventories based on senti-semantic evidence 
obtained after exploring text with annotated 
sentiment polarity information. Through this 
process, a graph-based algorithm is used to obtain 
auto-balanced values that characterize sentiment 
polarities, a well-known technique in Sentiment 
Analysis. This method consists of three key stages: 
(I) Building contextual word graphs; (II) Applying 
a ranking algorithm; and (III) Adjusting the 
sentiment polarity values. 
These stages are shown in the diagram in Figure 1, 
which the development of sentimental resources 
starts off by giving four corpora of annotated 
sentences (the first with neutral sentences, the 
second with objective sentences, the third with 
positive sentences, and the last with negative 
sentences). 
 
 
Figure 1. Resource walkthrough development 
process. 
2.3 Building contextual word graphs 
Initially, text preprocessing is performed by 
applying a Post-Tagging tool (using Freeling 
(Atserias et al, 2006) tool version 2.2 in this case) 
to convert all words to lemmas 5 . After that, all 
obtained lists of lemmas are sent to RA-SR, then 
divided into four groups: neutral, objective, 
positive, and negative candidates. As the first set 
                                                 
5 Lemma denotes canonic form of the words.

of results, four contextual graphs are 
obtained:  ????,   ???? , ????,  and ???? , where 
each graph includes the words/lemmas from the 
neutral, objective, positive and negative sentences 
respectively. These graphs are generated after 
connecting all words for each sentence into 
individual sets of annotated sentences in 
concordance with their annotations (??? , ??? , 
???, ??? ). 
Once the four graphs representing neutral, 
objective, positive and negative contexts are 
created, we proceed to assign weights to apply 
graph-based ranking techniques in order to auto-
balance the particular importance of each vertex ?? 
into ????, ????, ???? and ????. 
As the primary output of the graph-based ranking 
process, the positive, negative, neutral, and 
objective values are calculated using the PageRank 
algorithm and normalized with equation (1). For a 
better understanding of how the contextual graph 
was built see (Guti?rrez et al, 2013). 
2.4 Applying a ranking algorithm 
To apply a graph-based ranking process, it is 
necessary to assign weights to the vertices of the 
graph. Words involved into ????, ????, ???? 
and ???? take the default of 1/N as their weight 
to define the weight of ? vector, which is used in 
our proposed ranking algorithm. In the case where 
words are identified on the sentiment repositories 
(see Table 4) as positive or negative, in relation to 
their respective graph, a weight value of 1 (in a 
range [0?1] ) is assigned. ?  represents the 
maximum quantity of words in the current graph. 
After that, a graph-based ranking algorithm is 
applied in order to structurally raise the graph 
vertexes? voting power. Once the reinforcement 
values are applied, the proposed ranking algorithm 
is able to increase the significance of the words 
related to these empowered vertices. 
The PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) 
adaptation, which was popularized by (Agirre and 
Soroa, 2009) in Word Sense Disambiguation 
thematic, and which has obtained relevant results, 
was an inspiration to us in our work. The main 
idea behind this algorithm is that, for each edge 
between ?i and ?j in graph ?, a vote is made from 
? i to ? j. As a result, the relevance of ? j is 
increased. 
On top of that, the vote strength from ?  to ? 
depends on ???? relevance. The philosophy behind 
it is that, the more important the vertex is, the 
more strength the voter would have. Thus, 
PageRank is generated by applying a random 
walkthrough from the internal interconnection of 
? , where the final relevance of ??  represents the 
random walkthrough probability over ? , and 
ending on ??.  
In our system, we apply the following 
configuration: dumping factor ? = 0.85 and, like 
in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) we used 30 iterations. 
A detailed explanation about the PageRank 
algorithm can be found in (Agirre and Soroa, 
2009)  
After applying PageRank, in order to obtain 
standardized values for both graphs, we normalize 
the rank values by applying the equation (1), 
where ???(??) obtains the maximum rank value 
of ?? vector (rankings? vector). 
??? = ???/???(??) (1) 
2.5 Adjusting the sentiment polarity values 
After applying the PageRank algorithm on????, 
???? , ????  and ???? , having normalized their 
ranks, we proceed to obtain a final list of lemmas 
(named ?? ) while avoiding repeated elements. 
?? is represented by ???  lemmas, which would 
have, at that time, four assigned values: Neutral, 
Objective, Positive, and Negative, all of which 
correspond to a calculated rank obtained by the 
PageRank algorithm.  
At that point, for each lemma from ??,  the 
following equations are applied in order to select 
the definitive subjectivity polarity for each one: 
??? =  {
??? ? ??? ;  ??? > ???
0                ; ?????????
 (2) 
??? =  {
??? ? ??? ;  ??? > ???
0                ; ?????????
 (3) 
Where ???  is the Positive value and ???  the 
Negative value related to each lemma in ??. 
In order to standardize again the ???  and ??? 
values and making them more representative in a 
[0?1] scale, we proceed to apply a normalization 
process over the ??? and ??? values. 
From there, based on the objective features 
commented by (Baccianella et al, 2010), we 
assume the same premise to establish an 
alternative objective value of the lemmas. 
Equation (4) is used for that: 
?????? = 1 ? |??? ? ???| (4) 
Where ??????  represents the alternative 
objective value. 
445
As a result, each word obtained in the sentiment 
resource has an associated value of: positivity 
(??? , see equation (2)), negativity (??? , see 
equation (3)), objectivity(????_???,  obtained by 
PageRank over ????  and normalized with 
equation (1)), calculated-objectivity (??????, now 
cited as ???_???????? ) and neutrality (??? , 
obtained by PageRank over ???? and normalized 
with equation (1)). 
3  System Description 
The system takes annotated corpora as input from 
which two models are created. One model is 
created by using only the data provided at 
Semeval-2013 (Restricted Corpora, see Table 3), 
and the other by using extra data from other 
annotated corpora (Unrestricted Corpora, see 
Table 3). In all cases, the phrases are pre-
processed using Freeling 2.2 pos-tagger (Atserias 
et al, 2006) while a dataset copy is normalized 
using TENOR (described in section 2.1). 
The system starts by extracting two sets of 
features. The Core Features (see section 3.1) are 
the Sentiment Measures and are calculated for a 
standard and normalized phrase. The Support 
Features (see section 3.2) are based on regularities, 
observed in the training dataset, such as 
emoticons, uppercase words, and so on. 
The supervised models are created using Weka6 
and a Logistic classifier, both of which the system 
uses to predict the values of the test dataset. The 
selection of the classifier was made after analyzing 
several classifiers such as: Support Vector 
Machine, J48 and REPTree. Finally, the Logistic 
classifier proved to be the best by increasing the 
results around three perceptual points. 
The test data is preprocessed in the same way 
the previous corpora were. The same process of 
feature extraction is also applied. With the 
aforementioned features and the generated models, 
the system proceeds to classify the final values of 
Positivity, Negativity, and Neutrality.  
3.1 The Core Features 
The Core Features is a group of measures based on 
the resource created early (see section 2.2). The 
system takes a sentence preprocessed by Freeling 
2.2 and TENOR. For each lemma of the analyzed 
sentence, ??? , ??? , ???_???????? ,  ????_???, 
                                                 
6 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ 
and ???  are calculated by using the respective 
word values assigned in RA-SR. The obtained 
values correspond to the sum of the corresponding 
values for each intersecting word between the 
analyzed sentence (lemmas list) and the obtained 
resource by RA-SR. Lastly, the aforementioned 
attributes are normalized by dividing them by the 
number of words involved in this process. 
Other calculated attributes are: ???_????? , 
???_????? , ???_????????_????? , 
???_????_????? and ???_?????. These attributes 
count each involved iteration for each feature type 
( ??? , ??? , ????_??? , ??????  and ??? 
respectively, where the respective value may be 
greater than zero. 
Attributes ???  and cnn are calculated by 
counting the amount of lemmas in the phrases 
contained in the Sentiment Lexicons (Positive and 
Negative respectively).  
All of the 12 attributes described previously are 
computed for both, the original, and the 
normalized (using TENOR) phrase, totaling 24 
attributes. The Core features are described next.  
Feature Name Description 
???

Table 1. Core Features 
3.2 The Support Features 
The Support Features is a group of measures based 
on characteristics of the phrases, which may help 
with the definition on extreme cases. The emotPos 
and emotNeg values are the amount of Positive 
and Negative Emoticons found in the phrase. The 
exc and itr are the amount of exclamation and 
interrogation signs in the phrase. The following 
table shows the attributes that represent the 
support features:

chars contained in the respective 
graph ???????_???_?????_???  (in

Table 2. The Support Features 
4 Evaluation 
In the construction of the sentiment resource, we 
used the annotated sentences provided by the 
corpora described in Table 3. The resources listed 
in Table 3 were selected to test the functionality of 
the words annotation proposal with subjectivity 
and objectivity. Note that the shadowed rows 
correspond to constrained runs corpora: tweeti-b-
sub.dist_out.tsv 8  (dist), b1_tweeti-objorneu-
b.dist_out.tsv 9  (objorneu), twitter-dev-input-
B.tsv10 (dev). 
The resources from Table 3 that include 
unconstrained runs corpora are: all the previously 
mentioned ones, Computational-intelligence11 (CI) 
and stno12 corpora. 
The used sentiment lexicons are from the 
WordNetAffect_Categories13 and opinion-words14 
files as shown in detail in Table 4. 
Some issues were taken into account throughout 
this process. For instance, after obtaining a 
contextual graph ?, factotum words are present in 
most of the involved sentences (i.e., verb ?to be?). 
This issue becomes very dangerous after applying 
the PageRank algorithm because the algorithm

strengthens the nodes possessing many linked 
elements. For that reason, the subtractions ??? ?
??? and ??? ? ??? are applied, where the most 
frequent words in all contexts obtain high values. 
The subtraction becomes a dumping factor.  
As an example, when we take the verb ?to be?, 
before applying equation (1), the verb achieves the 
highest values in each subjective context graph 
(????  and ????)  namely, 9.94 and 18.67 rank 
values respectively. These values, once equation 
(1) is applied, are normalized obtaining both 
??? =  1 and ??? =  1 in a range [0...1]. At the 
end, when the following steps are executed 
(Equations (2) and (3)), the verb ?to be? 
achieves ??? = 0 , ??? = 0  and 
therefore  ?????? = 1 . Through this example, it 
seems as though we subjectively discarded words 
that appear frequently in both contexts (Positive 
and Negative).

4.1 The training evaluation 
In order to assess the effectiveness of our trained 
classifiers, we performed some evaluation tests.  
Table 5 shows relevant results obtained after 
applying our system to an environment (specific 
domain). The best results were obtained with the

restricted corpus. The information used to increase 
the knowledge was not balanced or perhaps is of 
poor quality. 
4.2 The test evaluation 
The test dataset evaluation is shown in Table 6, 
where system results are compared with the best 
results in each case. We notice that the constrained 
run is better in almost every aspect. In the few 
cases where it was lower, there was a minimal 
difference. This suggests that the information used 
to increase our Sentiment Resource was 
unbalanced (high difference between quantity of 
tagged types of annotated phrases), or was of poor 
quality. By comparing these results with the ones 
obtained by our system on the test dataset, we 
notice that on the test dataset, the results fell in the 
middle of the effectiveness scores. After seeing 
these results (Table 5 and Table 6), we assumed 
that our system performance is better in a 
controlled environment (or specific domain). To 
make it more realistic, the system must be trained 
with a bigger and more balanced dataset. 
Table 6 shows the results obtained by our 
system while comparing them to the best results of 
Task 2b of Semeval-2013. In Table 5, we can see 
the difference between the best systems. They are 
the ones in bold and underlined as target results.  
These results have a difference of around 20 
percentage points. The grayed out ones correspond 
to our runs.

Table 6 run descriptions are as follows:  
? UMCC_DLSI_(SA)-B-twitter-constrained 
(1_tw), 
? NRC-Canada-B-twitter-constrained 
(1_tw_cnd),  
? UMCC_DLSI_(SA)-B-twitter-unconstrained 
(2_tw), 
? teragram-B-twitter-unconstrained (2_tw_ter), 
? UMCC_DLSI_(SA)-B-SMS-constrained 
(1_sms), 
? NRC-Canada-B-SMS-constrained 
(1_sms_cnd), UMCC_DLSI_(SA)-B-SMS-
unconstrained (2_sms), 
? AVAYA-B-sms-unconstrained (2_sms_ava). 
As we can see in the training and testing 
evaluation tables, our training stage offered more 
relevant scores than the best scores in Task2b 
(Semaval-2013). This means that we need to 
identify the missed features between both datasets 
(training and testing). 
For that reason, we decided to check how many 
words our system (more concretely, our Sentiment 
Resource) missed. Table 7 shows that our system 
missed around 20% of the words present in the test 
dataset. 
 hits miss miss (%) 
twitter 23807 1591 6,26% 
sms 12416 2564 17,12% 
twitter nonrepeat   2426 863 26,24% 
sms norepeat 1269 322 20,24%

5 Conclusion and further work 
Based on what we have presented, we can say that 
we could develop a system that would be able to 
solve the SA challenge with promising results. The 
presented system has demonstrated election 
performance on a specific domain (see Table 5) 
with results over 80%. Also, note that our system, 
through the SA process, automatically builds 
sentiment resources from annotated corpora.  
For future research, we plan to evaluate RA-SR 
on different corpora. On top of that, we also plan 
to deal with the number of neutral instances and 
finding more words to evaluate the obtained 
sentiment resource.
