Abstract
We investigate the optimal LM treatment of
abundant filled pauses (FP) in spontaneous
monologues of a professional dictation task.
Questions addressed here are (1) how to deal
with FP in the LM history and (2) to which ex-
tent can the LM distinguish between positions
with high and low FP likelihood. Our results
differ partly from observations reported on di-
alogues. Discarding FP from all LM histories
clearly improves the performance. Local per-
plexities, entropies and word rankings at po-
sitions following FP suggest that most FP in-
dicate hesitations rather than restarts. Proper
prediction of FP allows to distinguish FP from
word positions by a doubled FP probability.
Recognition experiments confirm the improve-
ments found in our perplexity studies.
1 Introduction
Speech disfluencies are characteristic for spontaneous
speech. Different disfluency types can be distinguished:
Filled pauses (FP) such as ?UH? or ?UM?, restarts or re-
pairs, and repetitions. It is widely accepted that disflu-
encies considerably degrade the performance of speech
recognition due to unexpected word sequences and due
to the acoustic confusability of FP with short function
words.
Most publications investigate different types of disflu-
encies in spontaneous dialogues. This paper, instead, re-
ports analyses on spontaneous dictation of medical re-
ports, i.e. on spontaneous monologues. Our studies focus
on FP which are clearly dominant in our data (8% fre-
quency) and which appear to be mainly associated with
hesitations. As opposed to dialogues, FP are never used
here to prevent interruptions by the dialogue partner as
the speaker is searching for some formulation.
Central questions for language modeling are the op-
timal prediction of FP and its treatment in the LM his-
tory. Discarding FP from the history should be helpful if
the sentence is continued after the interruption. For com-
plete restarts, however, preceding words may be mislead-
ing and a conditioning on FP may be better. On Switch-
board, (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996) found that words
following FP are better predicted if FP is not discarded
from the history. This was attributed to the tendency of
FP to appear at sentence boundaries where the word con-
text from the preceding sentence appears to be harmful.
Measurements after sentence-internal FP only, however,
showed a local perplexity reduction for FP-cleaned histo-
ries by 20?30%. This was expected since most sentences
are continued after the FP. These observations were con-
firmed by (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996) for sentence-internal
FP but the local perplexity reduction due to skipping FP
was much smaller. Interestingly, there, local trigram per-
plexities after FP are about 40% worse than bigram per-
plexities, no matter whether FP was discarded from the
history or not. For a How May I Help You task, (Rose and
Riccardi, 1999) report an improved LM prediction if FP
is explicitly used for the conditioning of following words.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
the dictation task and our corpora. Section 3 lists three
basic approaches to treat FP in trigram LMs. Section 4
discusses various perplexity comparisons, especially fo-
cussing on the question how to treat FP in the LM history.
An extra study is concerned with LM uncertainties after
FP. Finally, we analyze how well our LMs can discrimi-
nate FP from word positions. Section 5 summarizes our
results and cites related speech recognition experiments.
2 Corpora
Our experiments are based on about 1.4 Mio. words of
real-life dictated medical reports from various US hospi-
tals which are partitioned into a Train, Dev, and Eval set
(Table 1). The dictation style is fully spontaneous with
repairs, repetitions, partial words, and ? most frequent ?
filled pauses. Manual transciptions of these data include
the annotation of FP. However, tags to distinguish be-
tween FP associated with hesitations, repairs, and restarts
are missing. Here, as opposed to Switchboard, most FP
are sentence-internal (ca. 70?80%).
A large background corpus provides formatted, i.e.
non-spontaneous reports which are mapped to the 60 k
word list of our recognition system. To train LMs includ-
ing FP this ?Report? corpus was stochastically enriched
with FP. Considering single or sequential FP/s as hid-
den events in the reports we randomly inserted them with
their a-posteriori probabilities in the given word contexts.
These probabilities are estimated using a bigram from the
spontaneous training data. A similar approach was men-
tioned without details in (Gauvain et al, 1997). They
report increasing error rates if too many FP are inserted
by this method into the LM training data. This might be
explained by the following observation: Adding FP in a
context-dependent fashion diminishes the number of ob-
served bi- and trigrams since words typically preceding
or following FP ?loose individual contexts? if many FP
are inserted. For our Report corpus, the number of dis-
tinct uni- + bi- + trigrams drops from 107 M (without FP)
to 98 M (after FP enrichment).

Table 1: Characteristics of text corpora including FP.
(The high OOV rate on Train is due to an extension of
this data set after fixing our 60 k word list.)
3 Language models
Mapping all filled pauses to a unique symbol FP we com-
pare three LM approaches:
1. We treat FP as a regular word which is predicted by
the LM and which conditions following words.
2. We use the LM for both words and FP but discard
all FP from the conditioning histories.
3. We use a fixed, context-independent probability for
FP of 0.08 (FP unigram). Here, words are predicted
with a FP-free LM skipping FP in the history (as in
approach 2.). Normalization is achieved by a scal-
ing of word probabilities with (1 ? pfix(FP)). This
simplistic approach relieves us from the need of FP-
tagged corpora, but we clearly loose the discrimina-
tive prediction of FP.
Approaches 1. and 2. use count statistics with FP. As
discussed above, the inclusion of FP ?destroys? some
possible word transitions. To exploit the knowledge
about possible FP-cleaned transitions we successfully
tested merged counts. Here, the sets of observed M-
Grams in the corpus with and without FP are joined and
counts of common M-Grams are added. (Doubled counts
use modified discounting and the reduced FP-rate is com-
pensated using marginal adaptation (Kneser et al, 1997).)
All reported results are obtained with linearly interpo-
lated models from the spontaneous Train and the non-
spontaneous Report corpus. (For trigrams, perplexities
of these two component LMs are 95% and 19% above
the perplexity of the interpolated LM.)
4 Experimental results
The three approaches are evaluated in terms of the overall
perplexity (PP) and local values: PPFP and PPword are
measured at FP and word positions only, and PPafter ?
are measured immediately thereafter.
The results in Table 2 show that discarding FP from the
history clearly improves the performance (2. versus 1.).
The overall PP is reduced by 4?5%. Big reductions by
30?40% are found at positions immediately following FP.
This, and the improvements as we go from bi- to trigrams
(which are contrary to (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996)), indi-
cates that sentences are ? on average ? continued after FP.
Using merged counts further improves our LMs. Gains
are (almost) additive to those from FP-skipping. Espe-
cially, PPafter FP decreases by another 10% for approach
2. which shows that the ?recovered? FP-free M-Grams
are indeed valuable if we use FP-free histories.
A comparison of PPafter FP and PPafter word confirms
the common knowledge that word prediction after FP is
pretty hard. Even the unigram perplexity is almost 50%
higher for words following FP than for words follow-
ing fluent contexts. This supports (Shriberg and Stolcke,
1996) where the reduced predictability after FP is partly
attributed to the chosen words in those positions.
For trigrams, the discrepancy between PPafter FP and
PPafter word is much larger. Asking ?how unexpected is
a word in a given context ?? we evaluated the entropy
H(hi) = ?
?
w pLM(w | hi) ? log pLM(w | hi) and the
rank Ri of wi following hi in the distribution pLM(? | hi).
Both quantities were averaged over histories hi ending on
FP or on words.1 Note that eHmean represents a perplex-
ity for the case that words following each history are dis-
tributed according to pLM(? | h). An actually measured
PP above eHmean indicates a bias in the corpus towards
words with low pLM(w | h). The results from Table 3
show almost no such bias after words. After FP, however,
following words are clearly biased to low probabilities
within the trigram distributions. Also, the mean ranks are
considerably higher after FP than after words.
Together, these findings support our impression that FP
often represents a hesitation where the speaker is search-
ing for a less common word or formulation.
1(Shriberg and Stolcke, 1996) report increasing entropies at
FP versus word positions. Our studies confirm these results.

Recall that approach 3. cannot discriminate between
positions with an increased or reduced FP probability. To
evaluate the discrimination for approaches 1. and 2. we
calculated p(FP| h) instead of p(w | h) at each position
in the corpus. The crucial result is that the mean FP prob-
ability is reduced by 48% and 45% (approach 1. and 2.)
at word as compared to FP positions. This is an important
feature of these LMs since small FP probabilities reduce
confusions of proper words with FP.
5 Summary
Concerning the question how to best predict words next
to FP we get the following results for our spontaneous
dictation task: Discarding FP from the LM histories re-
duces PPoverall by 4% and PPafter FP by 30%. (The
latter reduction is bigger than in (Stolcke and Shriberg,
1996). Note that our measurements include positions af-
ter sentence-initial FP which suffer from the FP-removal.)
Count merging with FP-free M-Grams gives an additional
reduction of PPoverall by 3% and of PPafter FP by 10%.
Comparisons of local perplexities and studies of en-
tropies and word rankings indicate that FP often repre-
sents a hesitation as speakers are searching for a less com-
mon word or formulation which is hard to predict.
At positions following FP, trigrams outperform bi-
grams. This together with gains from discarded FP sug-
gests that FP rarely represent sentence breaks or restarts.
We presented a new analysis of the LM?s power to dis-
criminate between FP and word positions. Predicting FP
with a trigram allows to lower the FP probability at word
positions by almost 50%. This is an important feature to
reduce confusions of words with FP.
Speech recognition experiments are published in
(Schramm et al, 2003). Using merged counts and dis-
carding FP from the LM history reduces the error rate on
Eval by 2.2% (relative) while PP is reduced by 7%.
