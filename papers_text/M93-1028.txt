INTRODUCTION
Presentations in the Text Analysis Techniques session covered areas related to :
? disambiguation of temporal expressions (Lois Childs, GE/Martin Marietta) ,
? trainable correction of Japanese word segmentation (Sean Boisen, BBN) ,
? principle-based parsing (Robert Belvin, Language Systems Inc .) ,
? and disambiguating with semantic tags (Jim Cowie, NMSU).
DISAMBIGUATING TEMPORAL EXPRESSION S
Lois Childs discussed GE's efforts to extract temporal expressions from text through the identification of
relevant patterns . The Shogun system used 37 patterns in English, and 7 for Japanese . Patterns wer e
context dependent, and referenced a dateline in order to handle relative time . The patterns were able to
perform temporal calculations, and the system computed a temporal structure from reference points on th e
dateline. The system was able to handle temporal references which were spread throughout a message . This
approach allowed the Shogun system to have a good coverage of time fills ; extensions to this approach wil l
provide improved handling of ambiguous dates .
AUTOMATICALLY TRAINABLE ERROR CORRECTION O F
JAPANESE SEGMENTATION AND PART-OF-SPEECH ANAL-
YSIS
Sean Boisen presented BBN 's work on a learning algorithm which was used to improve the performanc e
of the Juman Japanese word-segmentation system provided by Kyoto University . BBN used AMED (Au-
tomatic Morphological Error Detection) as a segment correction model between Juman and BBN's POS T
tagger . Using hand-produced segmentation and tagging for training purposes, the system was able to ac -
quire transformations from tags, and learn rules for segment correction, in order to reclassify words, pu t
words together, and take words apart . The system produced a chart of possible corrections . The supervised
training used Treebank software . The AMED/POST combination was able to improve segmentation and
tagging performance with little data ; this approach will be extended to parsing in the future .

SOME ASPECTS OF PRINCIPLE-BASED PARSING IN THE
MUC-5 TAS K
Robert Belvin described the use of principle-based parsing in LSI's parser, in particular the use of principle s
of grammatical theory and parsing principles (based on empirical knowledge of language) . LSI 's parser
incorporates a number of features of the Government-Binding theory of syntax, including projection and
thematic principles, in an essentially head-driven parser which employs bottom-up and expectation-base d
characteristics . The parser is designed to be language independent, to produce syntactic structures whic h
facilitate semantic processing, and to be robust enough to produce partial parses which are usable in late r
semantic processing . Robert discussed the handling of empty categories, with respect to passive constructions
and embedded infinitivals. Robert concluded with a discussion of the insertion of special structures as a mean s
of providing a "quick fix " for constructions which are not completely handled by the principles which have
been implemented .
DEALING WITH AMBIGUITY
Jim Cowie discussed experiences with NMSU's reference resolution module in their Diderot system . The
system attempted to disambiguate text into a list of sense tokens . Disambiguation was performed in parsing
and semantic tagging stages . Tagging was done using word-lists with semantic and type tags . Parsing use d
tags in conjunction with co-specification patterns . Jim discussed various problems which occurred, includin g
a lack of sense-tokens for Japanese, multiple-tagging problems, the need for a lexical database featurin g
compound terms, the need for domain-specific markers, the need for combinatorial rules, and the need fo r
negative blocking information . Future experiments will focus on the use of machine learning techniques fo r
acquiring semantic tagging information and deriving semantic patterns .
