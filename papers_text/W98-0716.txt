Abstract 
This paper presents the results of using 
Roget's International Thesaurus as the 
taxonomy in a semantic similarity 
measurement task. Four similarity metrics 
were taken from the literature and applied to 
Roget's. The experimental evaluation 
suggests that the traditional edge counting 
approach does surprisingly well (a 
correlation of r=0.88 with a benchmark set 
of human similarity judgements, with an 
upper bound of r=0.90 for human subjects 
performing the same task.) 
Introduction 
The study of semantic relatedness has been a 
part of artificial intelligence and psychology for 
many years. Much of the early semantic 
relatedness work in natural language processing 
centered around the use of Roget's thesaurus 
(Yaworsky 92). As WordNet (Miller 90) became 
available, most of the new work used it (Agirre 
& Rigau 96, Resnik 95, Jiang & Conrath 97). 
This is understandable, as WordNet is freely 
available, fairly large and was designed for 
computing. Roget's remains, though, an 
attractive l xical resource for those with access 
to it. Its wide, shallow hierarchy is densely 
populated with nearly 200,000 words and 
phrases. The relationships among the words are 
also much richer than WordNet's IS-A or HAS- 
PART links. The price paid for this richness is a 
somewhat unwieldy tool with ambiguous links. 
This paper presents an evaluation of Roget's 
for the task of measuring semantic similarity. 
This is done by using four metrics of semantic 
similarity found in the literature while using 
Roget's International Thesaurus, third edition 
(Roget 1962) as the taxonomy. Thus the results 
can be compared to those in the literature (that 
used WordNet). The end result is the ability to 
compare the relative usefulness of Roget's and 
WordNet for this type of task. 
1 Semantic Similarity 
Each metric of semantic similarity makes 
assumptions about he taxonomy in which it 
works. Generally, these assumptions go unstated 
but since they are important for the 
understanding of the results we obtain, we will 
cover them for each metric. All the metrics 
assume a taxonomy with some semantic order. 
1.1 Distance Based Similarity 
A common method of measuring semantic 
similarity is to consider the taxonomy as a tree, 
or lattice, in semantic space. The distance 
between concepts within that space is then taken 
as a measurement of the semantic similarity. 
1.1.1 Edges as distance 
If all the edges (branches of the tree) are of 
equal ength, then the number of intervening 
edges is a measure of the distance. The 
measurement usually used (Rada et al 89) is the 
shortest path between concepts. This, of course, 
relies on an ideal taxonomy with edges of equal 
length. In taxonomies based on natural 
languages, the edges are not the same length. In 
Roget's, for example, the distance (counting 
edges) between Intellect and Grammar is the 
same as the distance between Grammar and 
Phrase Structure. This does not seem intuitive. 
In general, the edges in this type of taxonomy 
tend to grow shorter with depth.

1.1.2 Related Metn'cs 
A number of different metrics related to distance 
have used edges that have been modified to 
correct for the problem of non-uniformity. The 
modifications include the density of the 
subhierarchies, the depth in the hierarchy where 
the word is found, the type of links, and the 
information content of the nodes subsuming the 
word. 
The use of density is based on the 
observation that words in a more densely part of 
the hierarchy are more closely related than 
words in sparser areas (Agirre and Rigau 96). 
For density to be a valid metric, the hierarchy 
must be fairly complete or at least the 
distribution of words in the hierarchy has to 
closely reflect he distribution of words in the 
language. Neither of these conditions ever hold 
completely. Furthermore, the observation about 
density may be an overgeneralization. In 
Roget's, for instance, category 277 Ship/Boat 
has many more words (much denser) than 
category 372 Blueness. That does not mean that 
kayak is more closely related to tugboat than sky 
blue is to turquoise. In fact, it does not even 
mean that kayak is closer to Ship/Boat han 
turquoise is to Blueness. 
Depth in the hierarchy is another attribute 
often used. It may be more useful in the deep 
hierarchy of WordNet han it is in Roget's where 
the hierarchy is fairly flat and uniform. All the 
words in Roget's are at either level 6 or 7 in the 
hierarchy. 
The type of link in WordNet is explicit, in 
Roget's it is never clear but it consists of more 
than IS-A and HAS-PART. One such link is 
HAS-ATTRIBUTE. 
Some of the researchers that have used the 
above metrics include Sussna (Sussna 93) who 
weighted the edges by using the density of the 
subhierarchy, the depth in the hierarchy and the 
type of link. Richardson and Smeaton 
(Richardson and Smeaton 95) used density, 
hierarchy depth and the information content of 
the concepts. Jiang and Conrath (Jiang and 
Conrath 95) used the number of edges and 
information content. They all reported 
improvement in results compared to straight 
edge counting. 
116 
McHale (95) decomposed Roget's taxonomy 
and used five different metrics to show the 
usefulness of the various attributes of the 
taxonomy. Two of those metrics deal with 
distance but only one is of interest to us for this 
task; the number of intervening words. The 
number of intervening words ignores the 
hierarchy completely, treating it as a flat file. 
For the measurement to be an accurate metric, 
two conditions must be met. Fi'i'st, the ordering 
of the words must be correct. Second, either all 
the words of the language must be represented 
(virtually impossible) or they must be evenly 
distributed throughout the hierarchy I. Since it is 
unlikely that either of these conditions hold for 
any taxonomy, the most that can be expected of 
this measurement is hat it might provide a 
reasonable approximation of the distance 
(similar to density). It is included here, not 
because the approximation is reasonable, but 
because it provides information that helps 
explain the other results. 
1.2 Information Based Similarity 
Given the above problems with distance related 
measures, Resnik (Resnik 95) decided to use just 
the information content of the concepts and 
compared the results to edge Counting and 
human replication of the same task. Resnik 
defines the similarity of two concepts as the 
maximum of the Information Content of the 
concepts that subsume them in the taxonomy. 
The Information Content of a concept relies on 
the probability of encountering an instance of 
the concept. To compute this probability, Resnik 
used the relative frequency of occurrence of 
each word in the Brown Corpus 2. The 
probabilities thus found should fairly well 
approximate he true values for other 
generalized texts. The concept probabilities were 
then computed from the occurrences as simply 
the relative frequency of the concept. 
I This condition certainly does not hold true in 
WordNet where animals and plants represent a 
disproportionately large section of the hierarchy. 
2 Resnik used the semantic concordance (semcor) that 
comes with WordNet. Semcor is derived from a 
hand-tagged subset of the Brown Corpus. His 
calculations were done using WordNet 1.5.

Freq(c) 
(e) = 
N 
The information content of each concept is then 
given by IC(c) = log .i ~(c), where ~(c) is the 
probability. Thus, more common words have 
lower information content. 
To replicate the metric using Roget's, the 
frequency of occurrence of the words found in 
the Brown Corpus was divided by the total 
number of occurrences of the word in Roget's 3.
From the information content of each concept, 
the information content for each node in the 
Roget hierarchy was computed. These are 
simply the minimum of the information content 
of all the words beneath the node in the 
taxonomy. Therefore, the information content of 
a parent node is never greater than any of its 
children. 
The metric of relatedness for two words 
according to Resnik is the information content of 
the lowest common ancestor for any of the word 
senses. What this implies is that, for the purpose 
of measuring relatedness, each synset in 
WordNet or each semicolon group in Roget's 
would have an information content equal to its 
most common member. For example, the words 
druid (Roget's Index number 1036.15) and pope 
(1036.8) would have an information content 
equal to that of clergy (1036). Clergy's 
information content is based on the two most 
common words below it in the hierarchy - 
brother and sister. Thus druid would have an 
information content less than that of brother, a 
situation that I do not find intuitive since druid 
appears much less frequently than brother. 
Computationally, the easiest way to compute 
the information content of a word is to 
completely compute the values for the entire 
hierarchy a priori. This involves approximately 
300,000 (200,000 words plus 100,000 nodes in 
3 The frequencies were computed for Roget's as the 
total frequency for each word divided by the number 
of senses in Roget. This gives us an approximation f 
the information content for each concept. The 
frequency data were taken from the MRC 
Psycholinguistic database available from the Oxford 
Text Archive.

the hierarchy) computations for the entire Roget 
hierarchy. This is sizeable overhead compared to 
edge counting which requires no a priori 
computations. Of course, once the computations 
are done they do not need to be recomputed until 
a new word is added to the hierarchy. Since the 
values for information content bubble up from 
the words, each addition of a word would 
require that all the hierarchy above it be 
recomputed. 
Jiang and Conrath (Jiang and Conrath 97) 
also used information content to measure 
semantic relatedness but they combined it with 
edge counting using a formula that also took into 
consideration local density, node depth and link 
type. They optimized the formula by using two 
parameters, ct and ~, that controlled the degree 
of how much the node depth and density factors 
contributed tothe edge weighting computation. 
If t~----0 and 13=1, then their formula for the 
distance between two concepts cl and c2 
simplifies to 
Dist(cl,c2) = IC(c0 + IC(c2) - 2 X \[C(LS(cbc2)) 
Where LS(cbc2) denotes the lowest super- 
ordinate ofcl and c2. 
2 Evaluation 
The above metrics are used to rate the similarity 
of a set of word pairs. The results are evaluated 
by comparing them to a rating produced by 
human subjects. Miller and Charles (199 l) gave 
a group of students thirty word pairs and asked 
the students to rate them for "similarity in 
meaning" on a scale from 0 (no similarity) to 4 
(perfect synonymy). Resnik (1995) replicated 
the task with a different set of students and 
found a correlation between the two ratings of 
r=.9011 for the 28 word pairs tested. Resnik, 
Jiang and Conrath (1997) and I all consider this 
value to be a reasonable upper-bound towhat 
one should expect from a computational method 
performing the same task. 
Resnik also performed an evaluation of two 
computational methods both using WordNet 1.5. 
He evaluated simple edge counting (r=-.6645) 
and information content (r=.791 l). Jiang and 
Conrath improved on that some (r=-.8282) using 
a version of their combined formula given above

that had been empirically optimized for 
WordNet. 
Table I gives the results from Resnik (the 
first four columns) along with the ratings of 
semantic similarity for each word pair using 
information content, he number of edges, the 
number of intervening words and Jiang and 
Conrath's implified formula (e,--0, 13=1) with 
respect to Roget's. Both the number of edges 
and the number of intervening words are given 
in their raw form. The correlation value for the 
edges was computed using (12 - Edges) where 
12 is the maximum number of edges. The 
correlation for intervening words was computed 
using (199,427 - words).

4 Discussion 
Information Content is very consistent between 
the two hierarchies. Resnik's correlation for 
WordNet was 0.7911 while the one conducted 
here for Roget's was 0.7900. This is remarkable 
in that he IC values for Roget's used the 
average number of occurrences for all the senses 
of the words whereas for WordNet he number 
of occurrences of the actual sense of the word 
was used. This may be explainable by realizing 
that in either case the numbers are just 
approximations ofwhat he real values would be 
for any particular text. 
Jiang & Conrath's metric did just a little 
worse using Roget's than the results they gave 
using WordNet but that may very well be 
because I was unable to optimize the values of ct 
and \[3 for Roget's. 
The harder esult to explain seems to be 
edge counting. It does much better in the 
118 
shallow, uniform hierarchy of Roget's than it 
does in WordNet. Why this is the case requires 
further investigation. Factors to consider include 
the uniformity of edges, the maximum number 
of edges in each hierarchy and the general 
organization of the two hierarchies. I expect hat 
major factors are the fairly uniform nature of 
Roget's hierarchy and the broader set of 
semantic relations allowed in Roget's. Currently, 
it seems that Roget's captures the popular 
similarity of isolated word pairs better than 
WordNet does. 
5 Related Work 
Agirre and Rigau (Agirre and Rigau 1996) use a 
conceptual distance formula that was created to 
by sensitive to the length of the shortest path that 
connects the concepts involved, the depth of the 
hierarchy and the density of concepts in the 
hierarchy. Their work was designed for 
measuring words in context and is not directly 
applicable to the isolated word pair 
measurements done here. Agirre and Rigau feel 
that concepts in a dense part of the hierarchy are 
relatively closer than those in a more sparse 
region; a point which was covered above. To 
measure the distance, they use a conceptual 
density formula. The Conceptual Density of a 
concept, as they define it, is the ratio of areas; 
the area expected beneath the concept divided by 
the area actually beneath it. 
Some of the results given in Table 1 seem to 
support he use of density. The word pairs 
forest-graveyard and chord-smile both have an 
edge distance of 8. The number of intervening 
words for each pair are considerably different 
(296 and 3253 respectively). For these particular 
word pairs the latter numbers more closely 
match the ranking iven by humans. If one 
considers density important then perhaps we can 
use a different measure of density by computing 
the number of intervening words per edge 4. This 
metric was tested with the 28 word pairs and the 
results were a slight improvement (r=.6472) 
over the number of intervening words but are 
still well below that attained by simple edge 
counting. 
4 Words/Edge is a metric of density analogous to 
People/Square Mile.

Conclusion 
This paper presented the results of using 
Roget's International Thesaurus as the taxonomy 
in a semantic similarity measurement task. Four 
similarity metrics were taken from the literature 
and applied to Roget's. The experimental 
evaluation suggests hat the traditional edge 
counting approach does surprisingly well (a 
correlation of r=0.8862 with a benchmark set of 
human similarity judgements, with an upper 
119 
bound of r=0.9015 for human subjects 
performing the same task.) 
The results hould provide incentive to those 
wishing to understand the effect of various 
attributes on metrics for semantic relatedness 
across hierarchies. Further investigation of why 
this dramatic improvement in edge counting 
occurs in the shallow, uniform hierarchy of 
Roget's needs to be conducted. The results 
should prove beneficial to those doing research 
with Roget's, WordNet and other semantic 
based hierarchies.
