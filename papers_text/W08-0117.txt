Abstract
An attempt was made to statistically estimate
proposals which survived the discussion to
be incorporated in the final agreement in an
instance of a Japanese design conversation.
Low level speech and vision features of hearer
behaviors corresponding to aiduti, noddings
and gaze were found to be a positive pre-
dictor of survival. The result suggests that
non-linguistic hearer responses work as im-
plicit proposal filters in consensus building,
and could provide promising candidate fea-
tures for the purpose of recognition and sum-
marization of meeting events.
1 Introduction
Non-verbal signals, such as gaze, head nods, fa-
cial expressions and bodily gestures, play signif-
icant roles in the conversation organization func-
tions. Several projects have been collecting multi-
modal conversation data (Carletta et al, 2006) for
multi-party dialogues in order to develop techniques
for meeting event recognitions from non-verbal as
well as verbal signals. We investigate, in this paper,
hearer response functions in multi-party consensus-
building conversations. We focus particularly on the
evaluative aspect of verbal and non-verbal hearer re-
sponses. During the course of a consensus-building
discussion meeting, a series of proposals are put
on the table, examined, evaluated and accepted or
rejected. The examinations of proposals can take
the form of explicit verbal exchanges, but they can
also be implicit through accumulations of hearer
responses. Hearers would express, mostly uncon-
sciously for non-verbal signals, their interest and
positive appraisals toward a proposal when it is
introduced and is being discussed, and that these
hearer responses would collectively contribute to the
determination of final consensus making. The ques-
tion we address is whether and in what degree it is
possible and effective to filter proposals and estimate
agreement by using verbal and non-verbal hearer re-
sponses in consensus-building discussion meetings.
2 Multi-Party Design Conversation Data
2.1 Data collection
We chose multi-party design conversations for the
domain of our investigation. Different from a fixed
problem solving task with a ?correct? solution, par-
ticipants are given partially specified design goals
and engage in a discussion to come up with an agree-
ment on the final design plan. The condition of our
data collection was as follows:
Number of participants: six for each session
Arrangement: face-to-face conversation
Task: Proposal for a new mobile phone business
Role: No pre-determined role was imposed
A compact meeting archiver equipment, AIST-
MARC (Asano and Ogata, 2006), which can cap-
ture panoramic video and speaker-separated speech
streams, was used to record conversations (Fig. 1).
The data we examined consist of one 30 minutes
conversation conducted by 5 males and 1 female.
Even though we did not assign any roles, a chairper-
son and a clerk were spontaneously elected by the
participants at the beginning of the session.

2.2 Data Annotation
2.2.1 Clause units
In order to provide a clause level segmentation
of a multi-channel speech stream, we extended the
notion of ?clause units (CUs)?, originally developed
for analyzing spoken monologues in the Corpus of
Spontaneous Japanese (Takanashi et al, 2003), to
include reactive tokens (Clancy et al, 1996) and
other responses in spoken conversations. Two of the
authors who worked on the Corpus of Spontaneous
Japanese independently worked on the data and re-
solved the differences, which created 1403 CUs con-
sisting of 469 complete utterances, 857 reactive to-
kens, and 77 incomplete or fragmental utterances.
2.2.2 Proposal units
We developed a simple classification scheme of
discourse segments for multi-party consensus build-
ing conversations based on the idea of ?interaction
process analysis? (Bales, 1950).
Proposal: Presentation of new ideas and their eval-
uation. Substructure are often realized through
elaboration and clarification.
Summary: Sum up multiple proposals possibly
with their assessment
Orientation: Lay out a topic to be discussed and
signal a transition of conversation phases, initi-
ated mostly by the facilitator of the discussion
Miscellaneous: Other categories including opening
and closing segments
The connectivity between clause units, the content
of the discussion, interactional roles, relationship
with adjacent segments and discourse markers were
considered in the identification of proposal units.
Two of the authors, one worked on the Corpus of
Spontaneous Japanese and the other worked for the
Figure 2: Image processing algorithm
project of standardization of discourse tagging, in-
dependently worked on the data and resolved the
differences, which resulted in 19 proposals, 8 sum-
maries, 19 orientations and 2 miscellaneouses.
2.3 Core clause units and survived proposal
units
Core clause units (CUs) were selected, out of all the
clause units, based on whether the CUs have sub-
stantial content as a proposal. A CU was judged
as a core CU, when the annotator would find it ap-
propriate to express, upon hearing the CU, either an
approval or a disapproval to its content if she were
in the position of a participant of the conversation.
Three of the authors worked on the text data exclud-
ing the reactive tokens, and the final selection was
settled by majority decision. 35 core CUs were se-
lected from 235 CUs in the total of 19 proposal PUs.
Cohen?s kappa agreement rate was 0.894.
Survived proposal units (PUs) were similarly se-
lected, out of all the proposal units, based on
whether the PUs were incorporated in the final
agreement among all the participants. 9 survived
PUs were selected from 19 proposal PUs.
3 Feature Extraction of Hearer?s Behavior
For each clause unit (CU), verbal and non-verbal
features concerning hearer?s behavior were ex-
tracted from the audio and the video data.
3.1 Non-Verbal Features
We focused on nodding and gaze, which were ap-
proximated by vertical and horizontal head move-
ments of participants.
An image processing algorithm (Figure 2) was ap-
plied to estimate head directions and motions (Mat-
susaka, 2005). Figure 3 shows a sample scene and
the results of applying head direction estimation al-
gorithm.

The circles represent detected face areas, and the lines in
the circles represent head directions.
For each CU, the vertical and horizontal compo-
nents of head movements of 5 hearers were calcu-
lated for two regions, the region inside the CU and
the 1-sec region immediately after the CU. For each
of the two regions, the mean and the peak values and
the relative location, in the region, of the peak were
computed. These 12 non-verbal features were used
for the statistical modeling.
3.2 Verbal Features
Verbal features were extracted from the audio data.
For each CU, power values of 5 hearers were ex-
tracted for two regions, ?within? and ?after? CU, and
for each of the two regions, the mean and the peak
values and the relative location, in the region, of
the peak were computed. In addition to these ver-
bal features, we also used aiduti features of reactive
tokens (RTs). The percentage of the total duration
of RTs, the total number of RTs, and the number of
participants who produced an RT were computed in
?within? and ?after? regions for each of the CUs. A
total of 12 CU verbal features were used for the sta-
tistical modeling.
4 Experiments
4.1 Overview of the Algorithm
Statistical modeling was employed to see if it is pos-
sible to identify the proposal units (PUs) that are sur-
vived in the participants? final consensus. To this
end, we, first, find the dominant clause unit (CU) in
each PU, and, then, based on the verbal and non-
verbal features of these CUs, we classify PUs into
?survived? and ?non-survived.?

4.2 Finding Dominant CUs
A logistic regression model was used to model the
coreness of CUs. A total of 24 verbal and non-verbal
features were used as explanatory variables. Since
the number of non-core CUs was much larger than
that of core CUs, down-sampling of negative in-
stances was performed. To obtain a reliable estima-
tion, a sort of Monte Carlo simulation was adopted.
A model selection by using AIC was applied for
the 35 core CUs and another 35 non-core CUs that
were re-sampled from among the set of 434 com-
plete and non-core CUs. This process was repeated
100 times, and the features frequently selected in
this simulation were used to construct the optimal
model. Table 1 shows the estimated coefficient for
the optimal model, and Table 2 shows the accu-
racy based on a leave-1-out cross validation. The
dominant CU in each PU was identified as the CU

4.3 Finding Survived PUs
The verbal and non-verbal features of the dominant
CUs of each of the PUs were used for the modeling
of the survived-PU prediction. Discriminant analy-
sis was utilized and a model selection was applied
for the 47 PUs. Table 3 shows the estimated coeffi-
cient for the optimal model, and Table 4 shows the
accuracy based on a leave-1-out cross validation.
5 Discussions
The results of our estimation experiments indicate
that the final agreement outcome of the discus-
sion can be approximately estimated at the proposal
level. Though it may not be easy to identify actual
utterances contributing to the agreement (core-CUs),
the dominant CUs in PUs were found to be effective
in the identification of survived-PUs. The prediction
accuracy of survived-PUs was about 89%, with the
chance level of 69%, whereas that of core-CUs was
about 92%, with the chance level of 86%.
In terms of hearer response features, intensity
of verbal responses (within/speech power/mean, af-
ter/speech power/mean), and immediate nodding re-
sponses (after/vertical motion/peak loc.) were the
most common contributing features in core-CU es-
timation. In contrast, occurrence of a strong aiduti
immediately after, rather than within, the core-
CU (after/speech power/peak val.), and a strong
nodding within the core-CU (within/vertical mo-
tion/peak val.) appear to be signaling support from
hearers to the proposal. It should be noted that iden-
tification of target hearer behaviors must be vali-
dated against manual annotations before these gen-
eralizations are established. Nevertheless, the re-
sults are mostly coherent with our intuitions on the
workings of hearer responses in conversations.
6 Conclusions
We have shown that approximate identification of
the proposal units incorporated into the final agree-
ment can be obtained through the use of statistical
pattern recognition techniques on low level speech
and vision features of hearer behaviors. The result
provides a support for the idea that hearer responses
convey information on hearers? affective and evalu-
ative attitudes toward conversation topics, which ef-
fectively functions as implicit filters for the propos-
als in the consensus building process.
