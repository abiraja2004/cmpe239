In  th i s  paper,  we repor t  on an exper imenta l  system of 
Japanese sentence ana lys i s ,  ca l led  ESSAY, 
Many Japanese sentence ana lys i s  systems, not on ly  Phrase  
s t ructure  ana lys i s  systems but a l so  Ke~:a,rt-D~:e ane lys i s  sys -  
tems, are usua l ly  based on ru les  in  eTntact i c  leve l  or Case 
grammatical  res t r i c t ion .  
Comparing wi th  such systems,  our system i s  unique in  
the  d ic t ionary .  In  th i s  d ic t ionary ,  funct ion  of the language 
e lements ,  such as words or aux i l i a ry  morpheme, are dbscr~bed.  
And these lex lca l  ent r ies  are automat ica l ly  const ructed  from 
ana lys i s  of rea l  text  data~ 
Xn order  to eva luate  the use fu lness  of such d ic t ionary ,  
we are  accumulat ing Japanese sentences  data ,  and applTJ -~ 
s ta t i s t i ca l  and s t ruc tura l  ana lys i s  method to th i s  data .

( 1 ) Const ruct ion  of d ic t ionary  
As the in i t ia l  data  we entered  about 2000 sentences  of 
e lementary  school  text  in  Kana- le t te r  ( Japanese sy l labary)  
not  in  KanJi  (Chinese character ) .  
Japanese i s  an agF~ut inat ive  language,  so  in  ana lyz ing  
sentences  they are u~ua l ly  separated  in to  number of par ts

ca l led  Bunsetsu.  In  enter ing  the text  at th i s  t ime,  we a l so  
used th i s  un i t .  Between these  Bunsetsu,  there  are  some depend- 
ency re la t ions  ca l led  Kakari -Uke which can be dec ided un ique ly  
fo r  a~v sentence .  We can cons ider  that  in  case there  i s  a Kaka- 
r i -Uke  re la t ion  between word A and B, A i s  modi fy ing  B. 
This t ime we def ined  the  d i s tance  between words main ly  
based on th i s  Kakari -Uke re la t ion ,  and then o lass i~fted them 
in to  number of  groups us ing  some c lus ter ing  techn iques .  Am the  
resu l t  we got  a base-d ic t ionary  which can represent  Kakari-Uke 
re la t ion  between these  groups.  
I t  i s  expected that  syntax ,  sau~nt ios  or  knowledge of  
the  world can be natura l ly  embeded in  th i s  d ic t ionary  and th i s  
type of  lex icon  i s  h igh ly  use fu l  in  the Japanese sentence

(2) Overview of  ESSAY 
ESSAY (Exper imenta l  System of  Sentence AnalYs is)  parses  
Japanese sentence  by ana lyz ing  Kakari -Uke re la t ion  between 
Bunmetsu in  input  sentences .  
This  system ham d ic t ionary  dr iven  feature ,  and does not 
depend on usua l  syntact i c  and semant ic  models.  Thus th i s  
system can be used fo r  eva luat ion  of  d ic t ionary ,  which I s  de-  
scribed in (1). 
The input  to  th i s  system i s  a Japanese sentence ,  which 
i s  segmented in  Bunsetsu un i t ,  and the output  from th i s  system 
i s  labe l led  binary t ree  s t ruc ture ,  which represents  syntnot io  
s t ruc ture  of  the  input  sentence .  
The a lgor i thm to ext rac t  th i s  s t ruc ture  i s  very  s imple ,  
and spec ia l  l i ngu is t i c  knowledge i s  not  embedded in  the 
prooedurab le  way. The dec is ion  o f  t ree  s t ruc ture  i s  based on 
Graph theoret i c  p rocess ing ,  and labe l l ing  o f  Kakari -Uke re la t -  
i on  i s  processed by us ing  S ta t i s t i ca l  dec is ion  theory .

As s ta ted  above, th i s  system has i t  s i  l i ngu is t i c  know- 
ledge in  the dec la ra t ive  way by the form of d ic t ionary ,  thus 
s t ruc ture  of system i s  s imple,  and r i ch  in  modu lar i ty ,  But 
proaedurable knowledge can be eas i ly  implemented, i f  we need 
i t .  
By tak ing  th i s  approach, i t  i s  poss ib le  to get the way 
to  const ruot  a f lex ib le  system, which has r i ch  sh i l i ty  of 
adaptat ion  to spec i f ied  world.  This po int  i s  one of the mer i t s  
of ottr approach, in  comparison wi th  usua l  approaches,  that  tend 
%0 depend on researcher ' s  framework.
