PROJECT GOALS 
The primary long term goal of speech research at Dragon 
Systems is to develop algorithms that are capable of 
achieving very high performance large vocabulary con- 
tinuous speech recognition. At the same time, in the 
long run we are also concerned to keep the demands of 
those algorithms for computational power and memory 
as modest as possible, so that the results of our research 
can be incorporated into products that will run on mod- 
erately priced personal computers. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Much of the past year's effort has been devoted to 
work on speaker independent training, linear discrim- 
inant analysis, and acoustic modeling, using the Wall 
Street Journal corpus as our development vehicle, with 
the goal of attaining very high accuracy large vocabulary 
SI CSR. In the past, Dragon had focused primarily on 
speaker dependent and speaker adaptive recognition , so 
that speaker independent research was a new departure 
for us in this past year. Similarly, in the past Dragon 
had confined itself to recognition algorithms that were 
highly parsimonious in both computation and memory 
usage, but we have now, temporarily, dropped those con- 
straints in the interest of seeing just what is attainable 
with greater computational resources. 
Our research in the area of speaker independent training 
has focused on the use of tied mixture models with mul- 
tiparameter streams in representing the effect of context 
on the acoustic realization of a phoneme. These models 
are built using Bayesian smoothing in the context of the 
EM algorithm. The prior distribution for a tied mixture 
model for a phoneme in a specific context represents our 
opinion about that model based on other more generic 
models for that phoneme that have typically been built 
from much more data. 
An important theme of our research as been the ex- 
ploration of the tradeoff between the greater ability to 
model the dependence among acoustic parameters when

Projects Agency under contract number J-FBI-92-060. 
streams are high dimensional versus the greater acous- 
tic resolution possible in streams with fewer parameters. 
Another important thread has been the investigation of
a variety of strategies for building the basis components 
for the mixtures. 
The use of |MELDA, a particular form of linear discrim- 
inant analysis, has played a crucial role in our develop- 
ment in the last year as a way of eliminating some of 
the interspeaker variability represented in the parame- 
ters and, perhaps as a consequence, some of the depen- 
dence among our parameters, thus reducing the need for 
high dimensional streams. IMELDA also was used for the 
purpose of eliminating some of the variability due to the 
microphone in the DARPA "stress test". A further ben- 
eficial effect of this method lay in the reduction of the 
number of signal processing parameters (from 32 to 16) 
and thus the size of the acoustic models. 
The need to retrain our system many times during the 
course of our research led us to re-engineer the training so 
that models for different phonemes could simultaneously 
be built on different computers. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Dragon plans to continue to focus on improving the over- 
all quality of the acoustic models for large vocabulary 
speaker independent continuous speech recognition. We 
intend to enhance the set of acoustic parameters which 
are an input to the IMELDA transform, which is likely 
to continue to play a key role in our system. We will 
again cluster the output distributions of the states into 
PELs, or phonetic elements, as our earlier systems did, 
both for the purpose of reducing the size of the models 
and for the purpose of smoothing noisy estimates based 
on insufficient training data. Another direction for ex- 
ploration will be the use of mixture models without ied 
basis components. 
We also intend to investigate cross-word modeling more 
intensively, through the use of the position of the word 
boundary as part of the context of a triphone model, and 
possibly through the use of probabilistic phonological 
rules.
