Abstract
We describe a corpus of human-written En-
glish language summaries of line graphs. This
corpus is intended to help develop a system
to automatically generate summaries captur-
ing the most salient information conveyed by
line graphs in popular media, as well as to
evaluate the output of such a system.
1 Motivation
We are developing a system designed to automati-
cally generate summaries of the high-level knowl-
edge conveyed by line graphs found in multimodal
documents from popular media sources (e.g., mag-
azines, newspapers). Intended applications include
making these graphics more accessible for people
with visual impairments and indexing their infor-
mational content for digital libraries. Information
graphics like line graphs are generally included in
a multimodal document in order to make a point
supporting the overall communicative intent of the
document. Our goal is to produce summaries that
convey the knowledge gleaned by humans when in-
formally viewing the graphic, focusing on the ?take-
away? message rather than the raw data points.1
Studies have shown (Carberry et al, 2006) that
the captions of information graphics in popular me-
dia often do not repeat the message conveyed by the
graphic itself; such captions are thus not appropriate
for use as a summary. Furthermore, while scientific
graphs are designed for experts trained in their use
1Users generally prefer conceptual image descriptions over
perceptual descriptions (Jo?rgensen, 1998; Hollink et al, 2004).
for data visualization, information graphics in pop-
ular media are meant to be understood by all read-
ers, including those with only a primary school ed-
ucation. Accordingly, summaries for these graphics
should be tailored for the same general audience.
Research into information graphics by Wu et al
(2010) has identified a limited number of intended
message categories conveyed by line graphs in pop-
ular media. Their efforts included the creation of a
corpus2 of line graphs marked with the overall in-
tended message identified by human annotators.
However, we hypothesize that an effective sum-
mary should present the graph?s intended message
plus additional informational propositions that elab-
orate on this message. McCoy et al (2001) observed
that the intended message was consistently included
in line graph summaries written by human subjects.
Furthermore, participants in that study augmented
the intended message with descriptions of salient vi-
sual features of the graphic (e.g., steepness of a trend
line, volatility of data values). As part of the pro-
cess of building a system to identify which visual
features are salient and to describe them using nat-
ural language expressions, we collected a corpus of
human-written summaries of line graphs.
2 Building the Corpus
We selected 23 different line graphs for use in build-
ing our corpus. This set covered the eight most-
common intended message categories from the Wu
corpus; only Point Correlation and Stable Trend
were omitted. Table 1 shows the distribution of

graphs across message categories.3 Ten of the line
graphs were real world examples in popular media
taken from the Wu corpus (e.g., Figure 1). Another
ten graphs were adapted from items in the Wu cor-
pus ? modified in order to isolate visual features so
that their individual effects could be analyzed (e.g.,
Figure 2). The remaining three line graphs were cre-
ated specifically to fill a gap in the coverage of in-
tended messages and visual features for which no
good example was available (e.g., Figure 3). Our
goal was to include as many different combinations
of message category and visual features as possible
(e.g., for graphs containing a dramatic change in val-
ues because of a big jump or fall, we included ex-
amples which sustained the change as well as others
that did not sustain the change).
69 subjects participated in our study. All were
native English speakers, 18 years of age or older,
without major sight impairments, and enrolled in an
introductory computer science course at a university
in the US. They received a small amount of extra
credit in their course for participating in this study.
Each participant was given the full set of 23 line
graphs in differing orders. With each graph, the sub-
jects were presented with an initial summary sen-
tence describing the overall intended message of the
graphic, as identified by a human annotator. The
captions for Figures 1, 2, and 3 each contain the cor-
responding initial summary sentence that was pro-
vided to the participants. Participants were tasked
with writing additional sentences so that the com-
3Category descriptions can be found in (Wu et al, 2010).

Laboratories stock price in August ?99.?)
pleted summary of each line graph captured the most
important information conveyed by the graphic, fin-
ishing as many or as few of the 23 graphs as they
wished during a single one-hour session.
Participants were told that we were developing a
system to convey an initial summary of an informa-
tion graphic from popular media (as opposed to text-
books or scientific articles) to blind users via speech.
We indicated that the summaries they write should
be brief (though we did not specify any length re-
quirements), but ought to include all essential infor-
mation provided by the graphic. Subjects were only
given the graphics and did not receive the original ar-
ticle text (if any existed) that accompanied the real-
world graphs. Finally, the participants were told that
a person able to see the graphics should not think
that the summaries they wrote were misleading.
3 Corpus Characteristics
A total of 965 summaries were collected, ranging
from 37 to 49 summaries for each individual line
graph. Table 2 offers some descriptive statistics for
the corpus as a whole, while Table 3 lists the ten
most commonly-occurring content words.
Sample summary 1 (18-4.txt) was written for Fig-
ure 1, summary 2 (7-40.txt) for Figure 2, and sum-
maries 3 (9-2.txt) and 4 (9-5.txt) both for Figure 3:

AMD chips,? USA Today, Oct 19, 2006. (Initial sentence:
?This line graph shows a falling trend in Dell stock from
May ?05 to May ?06.?)
From March 26, 1999 the graph rises and de-
clines up until August 1999 where it rises at
about a 90-degree angle then declines again.

The graph peaked in July ?05 but then sharply
decreased after that. It had several sharp in-
clines and declines and ended with a shaper
decline from March ?06 to May ?06.

February has a much larger amount of jackets
sold than the other months shown. From dec-
ember to january, there was a slight drop in
the amount of jackets sold and then a large
spike from january to february.
(3)
The values in November and May are pretty
close, with both being around 37 or 38
jackets. At its peak (February), around 47
jackets were sold.

4 Potential Usage
To our knowledge, this is the first and only publicly-
available corpus of line graph summaries. It has sev-
eral possible applications in both natural language
generation and evaluation tasks. By finding and ex-
amining patterns in the summaries, we can discover
which propositions are found to be most salient for
certain kinds of graphs. We are currently analyzing
the collected corpus for this very purpose ? to iden-
tify relationships between visual features, intended
messages, and the relative importance of includ-
ing corresponding propositions in a summary (e.g.,
volatility is more salient in Figure 2 than Figure 3).

Not only does this corpus offer insight into what
humans perceive to be the most important informa-
tion conveyed by line graphs, it provides a large set
of real-world expressions from which to draw when
crafting the surface realization forms for summaries
of line graphs. From a generation perspective, this
collection of summaries offers copious examples of
the expressions human use to describe characteris-
tics of information graphics. The corpus could also
be used to determine the proper structural character-
istics of a line graph summary (e.g., when multiple
information is included, how propositions are aggre-
gated into sentences, which details come first).
The evaluation of graph understanding systems
will also benefit from the use of this corpus. It will
enable comparisons between system and human-

generated descriptions at the propositional (content)
level, as well as judgments involving clarity and co-
herence. The set of summaries for each graph may
be used as a ?gold standard? against which to com-
pare automatically-generated summaries in prefer-
ence judgment experiments involving human judges.
We are currently developing rules for identifying
the most salient information conveyed by a given
line graph based on an analysis of this corpus, and
will also use the expressions in the collected sum-
maries as examples for surface realization during the
summary generation process. Additionally, we are
planning to use the corpus during part of the evalu-
ation phase of our project, by asking human judges
to compare these human-written summaries against
our system?s output across multiple dimensions of
preference. It may also be useful to perform some
additional human subjects experiments to determine
which summaries in the corpus are found to be most
helpful and understandable.
5 Related Work
Prior to this study, we performed an initial investi-
gation based on a questionnaire similar to the one
used by Demir (2010) for bar charts. A group of
human subjects was asked to review several line
graphs and indicate how important it would be to
include various propositions in an initial summary
of each graphic. Although this method was effec-
tive with bar charts, it proved to be far too cumber-
some to work with line graphs. Bar charts are some-
what simpler, propositionally-speaking, as there are
fewer informational propositions that can be ex-
tracted from data represented as discrete bars rather
than as a continuous data series in a line graph.
It required far more effort for subjects to evaluate
the relative importance of each individual proposi-
tion than to simply provide (in the form of a writ-
ten summary) the set of propositions they consid-
ered to be most important. In the end, the summary-
based approach allowed for a more direct exami-
nation of salience judgments without subjects be-
ing constrained or influenced by the questions and
structure of the questionnaire-based approach, with
the added bonus of producing a reusable corpus of
human-written summaries of line graphs.
McCoy et al (2001) performed a study in which
participants were asked to write brief summaries for
a series of line graphs. While they did not release
a corpus for distribution, their analysis did suggest
that a graph?s visual features could be used to help
select salient propositions to include in a summary.
Although several corpora exist for general im-
age descriptions, we are unaware of any other cor-
pora of human-written summaries for information
graphics. Jo?rgensen (1998) collected unconstrained
descriptions of pictorial images, while Hollink et
al. (2004) analyzed descriptions of mental images
formed by subjects to illustrate a given text pas-
sage. Aker and Gaizauskas (2010) built a corpus of
human-generated captions for location-related im-
ages. Large collections of general image captions
have been assembled for information retrieval tasks
(Smeaton and Quigley, 1996; Tribble, 2010). Roy
(2002) evaluated automatically-generated descrip-
tions of visual scenes against human-generated de-
scriptions. The developers of the iGraph-Lite system
(Ferres et al, 2007) released a corpus of descrip-
tions for over 500 graphs collected from Statistics
Canada, but these descriptions were generated auto-
matically by their system and not written by human
authors. Additionally, the descriptions contained in
their corpus focus on the quantitative data presented
in the graphics rather than the high-level message,
and tend to vary only slightly between graphs.4
Since using corpus texts as a ?gold standard? in
generation and evaluation can be tricky (Reiter and
Sripada, 2002), we tried to mitigate some of the
common problems, including giving participants as
much time as they wanted for each summary to
avoid ?hurried writing.? However, as we intend to
use this corpus to understand which propositions hu-
mans find salient for line graphs, as well as generat-

contain the same sorts of information).

ing and evaluating new summaries, a larger collec-
tion of examples written by many authors for several
different graphics was more desirable than a smaller
corpus of higher-quality texts from fewer authors.
6 Availability
The corpus is freely available for download5 without
restrictions under an open source license.
The structure of the corpus is as follows. The
?summaries? directory consists of a series of subdi-
rectories numbered 1-23 containing the summaries
for all 23 line graphs, with each summary stored in
a separate file (encoded as ASCII text). The files
are named according to the graph they are associ-
ated with and their position in that graph?s collec-
tion (e.g., 8-10.txt is the 10th summary for the 8th
line graph, and is located in the directory named 8).
The root of the distribution package contains a
directory of original image files for the line graphs
(named ?line graphs?), the initial sentences describ-
ing each graph?s intended message (which was pro-
vided to the participants) in sentences.txt, and a
README file describing the corpus layout.
The corpus is easily loaded with NLTK (Loper
and Bird, 2002) using these Python commands:
from nltk.corpus import PlaintextCorpusReader
LGSroot = './LGSummaryCorpus/summaries'
corpus = PlaintextCorpusReader(LGSroot, '.*')
