All systems of automatic text processing are explicitly 
or implicitly based on two general linguistic ~ssumptlons: 
the assumption o~ grammatioallty of the texts processed, and 
the assumption of their meaningfulness. These assumptions, 
however, cannot be considered as absolute laws: It is not un- 
oommon that a text, thongh acceptable to most speakers of the 
corresponding language, still contains some morpholoEic 
and/or syntactic lngrammatlcalitles or cannot be completely 
Interpreted In terms of "standard" semantics; and conversely, 
startlng from an acceptable (meaningful) semantic structure 
one may as often as not fail to find fully "grammatical" 
language means that could express thls structure wlth absolute 
accuracy (one of the usual translation difficulties). Thls As 
due, f~om our po in t  of view, not on ly  to Incompleteness of
l ingu is t i c  and ext ra l lngu ls t l c  knowledge of  separate  people 
or to  Imper fect ions  In  the corresponding formal models, but 
also to the following two fundamental principles of Ilnguls- 
t i c  performance: 
I) a large number of ~equlrementa on lexico-gremmatic 
(superficial) manifestation of natural-language texts, and 
on their semantic Interpretation, are relative In that they 
characterize certain manifestations or Interpretations as more 
or  less normative (preferable) in the given conditions, rather 
than obligatory vs. Inadmissible In the absolute sense;

2) the in teract ion  between the requ i rements  of grammat- 
I ca l  and semantic normat iv l ty  of texts  adheres to a so~ of 
~omDlementarlt,7 principle: if the basic meaning of a text 
fragment is supposed by Its author to be sufficiently trans- 
parent or known apr lo r i  to the text  addressee,  the grammatlc-  
allty requirement for this fragment*s surface manifestation 
may be somewhat s lackened;  i f  on the cont rary ,  the author  
be l ieves  the text  to conta in  much Important  In fo rmat ion  new 
to the addressee,  the language ru les  used in  composing i t s  
surface manifestation are apt to be as standard and rigid as 
possible. 
In  th i s  p resentat ion  we In tend  to descr ibe  one Way of 
incorporat ing  the above pr inc ip les  in  the des ign  of  the 
ana lys i s  and synthes is  (generat ion)  components of an automat-  
Ic translation system. 
The general structure of the system viewed from this 
standpoint Is planned to be as follows. 
The major pert of factual linguistic Anformatlon Is 
formulated in the system regardless of the tasks of analysis 
or synthesis. It is shaped principally as a set of descript- 
ive rules arranged into dictionary and grammar according to 
the so-called lexlco~aphlc principle and classified into two 
maln types: the context-representation rules making up the 
contextual dictionary and grammar component, and the context- 
-contrastlvs rules forming the Inter-contextual grammar. 
The rules of both types describe the possible superficial 
manifestations and semantic Interpretations for elementary 
potent ia l  components of  text  s t ruc ture .  The k ind of text  
s t ruc ture  serv ing  as the po in t  of re fe rence  fo r  th i s  descr ip t -

s ign  and roughly cor respond ing to the leve l  o f  N.Chomsky's 
deep s t ruc tures .  
The context - representat ion  ru les  proceeding from th l8  
type of  s t ruc ture  spec i fy  the contextua l  funct ion ing  of

can stats all those particulars of the surface and/or semantic 
arrangement of natural-language texts (or of a special t~pe 
of texts) whAoh involve a kind of overall stylistic comparison,

The descr ip t ive  par t  of the system i s  made operat iona l  by 
means of spec ia l  cont ro l  components ac t ing  as "p lanners"  of 
the ana lys i s  and Synthes is  processes .  One of the main tasks 
of these components w i th in  the framework out l ined  cons is ts  in  
grad ing  the a l te rnat ives  obta ined from process ing  separate  
text  f ragments ,  as more or  less  p~omisln~ fo r  accompl ish ing ? 
the ana lys i s  ( rasp.  synthes is )  of  the whole text ,  th i s  g radat -  
Ion based,  among other  th ings ,  on the pr io r i ty  coe f f i c ients  
of the ru les  used to form (or check) d i f fe rent  a i te rnat tves j  
and on the in ter re la t ion  between these ru les  with respect  to  
the grammar and semantics "complementarity" principle. In as 
much as this aspect of processing Is concerned, the approach 
accepted makes It possible to re-lnterpret the well-known idea 
of "analysis through synthesis" and "synthesis through analy- 
s is" from the "normetlvlty" angle of vlew. Thus, for analysis 
one can reduce this Idea to a formalization of the followlng 
llne of reasoning (quits popular with translators or people 
somehow concerned with texts In foreign languages): "Express- 
ion X in the text at hand cannot mean Y because had the author 
meant Y he would have much rather used expression Z". 
Apart from a f fo rd ing  bet ter  p rocess ing  accuracy and 
e f f i c iency ,  exp l i c i t  in t roduct ion  of data on normat lv l ty  and 
pre ferab i l i ty  of  l ingu is t i c  un i te  and features  throughout a l l  
the major components of  a text  p rocess ing  system, and drawing 
on s ta t i s t i ca l  character i s t i cs  of LS -un i ts"  contextua l  mani-  
fes ta t ions  and in terpretat ions  as the cont ro l l ing  fac tor  In  
se lec t ing  the more "promising" among the a l te rnat ive  routes  of  
p rocess ing  concrete  texts ,  seems to have one more asset .
