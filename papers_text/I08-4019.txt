Abstract 
This paper expounds a Chinese word seg-
mentation system built for the Fourth 
SIGHAN Bakeoff. The system participates 
in six tracks, namely the CityU Closed, 
CKIP Closed, CTB Closed, CTB Open, 
SXU Closed and SXU Open tracks. The 
model of Conditional Random Field is used 
as a basic approach in the system, with at-
tention focused on the construction of fea-
ture templates and Chinese character cate-
gorization. The system is also augmented 
with some post-processing approaches such 
as the Extended Word String, model inte-
gration and others. The system performs 
fairly well on the 5 tracks of the Bakeoff. 
1 Introduction 
The Nanjing Normal University (NJNU) team par-
ticipated in CityU Closed, CKIP Closed, CTB 
Closed, CTB Open, SXU Closed, SXU Open 
tracks in the WS bakeoff. The system employed in 
the Bakeoff is based mainly on the model of CRF, 
optimized with some pre-processing and post-
processing methods. The team has focused its at-
tention on the construction of feature templates, 
Chinese character categorization, the use of Ex-
tended Word String and the integration of different 
segmentation models in the hope of achieving bet-
ter performance in both IVs?In Vocabulary 
words? and OOVs (Out Of Vocabulary words). 
Due to time limitations, some of these methods are 
still not fully explored. However, the Bakeoff re-
sults show that the performance of the overall sys-
tem is fairly satisfactory.  
The paper is organized as follows: section 2 
gives a brief description of the system; section 3 
and 4 are devoted to the discussion of the results of 
closed test and open test; a conclusion is given to 
comment on the overall performance of the system. 
2 System Description 
Conditonal Ramdom Field (CRF) has been widely 
used by participants in the basic tasks of NLP since 
Peng(2004). In both SIGHAN 2005 and 2006 
Bakeoffs CRF-based segmenters prove to have a 
better performance over other models. We have 
also chosen CRF as the basic model for the task of 
segmentation and uses the package CRF++ devel-
oped by Taku Kudo1. Some post-processing op-
timizations are also employed to improve the over-
all segmentation performance. The general descrip-
tion of the system is illustrated in Figure 1. The 
basic segmenter and post-processing are explained 
in the next two sections. 
2.1 Basic Segmenter 
As in many other segmentation models, our system 
also treats word segmentation as a task of classifi-
cation problem. During the experiment of the 
model, two aspects are taken into consideration, 
namely tag set and feature template. The 6-tag 
(Table 1) set proposed in Zhao(2006) is employed 
to mark various character position status in a Chi-
nese word. The feature template (Table 2) consid-

ers three templates of character features and three 
templates of character type features. The introduc-
tion of character type (Table 3) is based on the ob-
servation that many segmentation errors are caused 
by different segmentation standards among differ-
ent corpora, especially between Traditional Chi-
nese corpora and Simplified Chinese Corpora.

2.2 Post-Processing 
Two methods are used in post-processing to opti-
mize the results obtained from basic segmenter. 
The first is the binding of digits and English Char-
acters. The second is the use of extended word 
string to solve segmentation ambiguity. 
2.2.1 Binding Digits and Roman Letters 
Digits (ranging from ?0? to ?9?) are always bound 
as a word in Chinese corpora, while roman letters 
are treated differently in different corpora, some 
adding a full-length blank between the letters, 
some not. The system employs rule-based ap-
proach to bind both digits and roman letters. We 
also submitted two segmentation results for the 
Bakeoff, please refer to section 3.2 for discussion 
of these results. 
2.2.2 Extended Word String (EWS) Approach 
The CRF model performs well in segmenting IV 
word strings in general, but not in all contexts. Our 
system thus uses a memory based method, which 
is named as Extended Word String approach, to 
prevent CRF from making such error. All the Chi-
nese word strings, which are of character length 
from 2 to 10 and appear more than two times, are 
stored in a hash table, together with information of 
their segmentation forms. An example of EWS is 
given in Table 5. If the same character string ap-
pears in the test data, the system can easily re-
segment them by querying the hash table. If the 
query finds that the character string has only one 
segmentation form and checking shows that the 
string has no overlapping ambiguity with its left or 
right word, the segmentation of the string is then 
modified according to the stored segmentation type. 
Our experiment shows that the approach can pro-

3 Evaluation Results on Closed Test 
3.1 CKIP Closed Test 
In CKIP Closed Test, another kind of post process-
ing is used for OOVs. Examination on the output 
from basic segmenter shows that some OOVs iden-
tified by CRFs are not OOV errors, but IV errors. 
Sometimes it can not always segment the same 
OOV correctly in different context. For example, 
the person name ????? appears three times in 
the test, but it is only correctly detected twice, and 
for once it is wrongly detected. Our approach is to 
re-segment the OOVs string (with its left and right 
word) twice. Firstly the string is segmented using 
the training data wordlist, followed by a second 
segmentation using the OOV wordlist recognized 
by the Basic Segmenter. The result with the mini-
mum number of words is accepted.  
Example: 
Basic Seg Output?/?/??/??/ 
OOV Adjusting?    /?/???/?/ 
Basic Seg Output?/??/??/?/ 
OOV Adjusting?    /?/??/??/ 
With the OOV Adjusting Approach mentioned 
above, we got the third place in the track (Table 6). 
But when we use it on other corpora, the method 
does not promote the performance. Rather, it low-
ers the performance score. The reason is still not 
clear.

3.2 CKIP and CTB Closed Test 
In CKIP Closed Test, only the basic segmenter 
introduced in section 2 is used. Two segmentation 
results, namely a and b (Table 7 and 8) are submit-
ted for the Bakeoff. Result a binds the roman let-
ters as a word, while result b does not. The scores 
of the two results show that the approach is not 
stable in terms of score. We suggest that corpora 
submitted for evaluation purposes should pay more 
attention to non-Chinese word tagging and comply 
with the request of Bakeoff organizers.

3.3 SXU Closed Test 
Four results (a, b, c and d) are submitted for this 
track (Table 9). Results a and b are dealt in the 
same way as described in section 3.2. Result c is 
obtained by incorporating results from a memory-
based segmenter. The memory-based segmenter is 
mainly based on memory-based learning proposed 
by Daelemans(2005). We tested it on the training 
data with 90% as training data and 10% as testing 
data. The result shows that performance is im-
proved. However, when the method is applied on 
the Bakeoff test data, the performance is lowered. 
The reason is not identified yet. 
Result d was based on result c. It incorporates 
OOV words recognized by the system introduced 
in (Li & Chen, 2007) in the post-processing stage. 
Based on suffix arrays, Chinese character strings 
with mutual information value above 8.0 are auto-
matically extracted as words without any manual 
operation. We can see from table 9 that the F-
measure of result d improved and Foov of d got 2rd 
place in the test. And it is likely to get higher score 
if we combine it with result a.

4.1 Methods 
More features and resources are used in open test, 
mainly applied in the modification of feature tem-
plates. Besides the features used in the close test, 
we add to feature templates more information 
about Chinese characters, such as the Chinese radi-
cals (????), tones (5 tones), and another 6 Boo-
lean values for each Chinese character. The 6 Boo-
lean values indicate respectively whether the char-
acter is of Chinese surnames (????), or of Chi-
nese names (????), or of characters used for 
western person name translation (????), or of 
character used for English location name transla-
tion(????), or of affixes (??-?,?-??), or of sin-
gle character words (????). The feature tem-
plates constructed in this way is given in Table 10.

In the post-processing stage, we also add a Chi-
nese idiom dictionary (about 27000 items) to help 
increase the OOV word recall. 
4.2 Results 
In SXU open test, we submitted 3 results (a, b and 
c), but only a achieves the 4th rank in F-measure 
(Table 11). Features and resources added to the 
system turns out not to be of much use in the task, 
compared with our score on the closed test. 
Result b, c and all the results in CTB open test 
submitted have errors due to our pre-processing 
stage with CRF. Thus, the scores of them are very 
low, and some are even lower than our scores in 
closed test (see table 12).

5 Conclusions and Future Work 
This is the first time that the NJNU team takes part 
in SIGHAN WS Bakeoff. In the construction of the 
system, we conducted experiments on the CRF-
based segmenter with different feature templates. 
We also employs different post-processing ap-
proaches, including Extended Word String ap-
proach, digit and western roman letter combination, 
and OOV detection. An initial attempt is also made 
on the integration of different segmentation models. 
Time constraint has prevented the team from fuller 
exploration of the methods used in the system.  
Future efforts will be directed towards more com-
plicated segmentation models, the examination of 
the function of different features in the task, the 
integration of different models, and more efficient 
utility of other relevant resources.
