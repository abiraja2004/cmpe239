Abstract
We discuss results on the shared task of
Romanian-English word alignment. The
baseline technique is that of symmetrizing
two word alignments automatically gener-
ated using IBM Model 4. A simple vo-
cabulary reduction technique results in an
improvement in performance. We also
report on a new alignment model and a
new training algorithm based on alternat-
ing maximization of likelihood with mini-
mization of error rate.
1 Introduction
ISI participated in the WPT05 Romanian-English
word alignment task. The system used for baseline
experiments is two runs of IBM Model 4 (Brown et
al., 1993) in the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) im-
plementation, which includes smoothing extensions
to Model 4. For symmetrization, we found that Och
and Ney?s ?refined? technique described in (Och and
Ney, 2003) produced the best AER for this data set
under all experimental conditions.
We experimented with a statistical model for in-
ducing a stemmer cross-lingually, but found that the
best performance was obtained by simply lower-
casing both the English and Romanian text and re-
moving all but the first four characters of each word.
We also tried a new model and a new training
criterion based on alternating the maximization of
likelihood and minimization of the alignment error
rate. For these experiments, we have implemented
an alignment package for IBM Model 4 using a hill-
climbing search and Viterbi training as described in
(Brown et al, 1993), and extended this to use new
submodels. The starting point is the final alignment
generated using GIZA++?s implementation of IBM
Model 1 and the Aachen HMM model (Vogel et al,
1996).
Paper organization: Section 2 is on the baseline,
Section 3 discusses vocabulary reduction, Section 4
introduces our new model and training method, Sec-
tion 5 describes experiments, Section 6 concludes.
We use the following notation: e refers to an En-
glish sentence composed of English words labeled
ei. f refers to a Romanian sentence composed of
Romanian words labeled fj . a is an alignment of e
to f . We use the term ?Viterbi alignment? to denote
the most probable alignment we can find, rather than
the true Viterbi alignment.
2 Baseline
To train our systems, Model 4 was trained two times,
first using Romanian as the source language and
then using English as the source language. For each
training, we ran 5 iterations of Model 1, 5 iterations
of the HMM model and 3 iterations of Model 4.
For the distortion calculations of Model 4, we re-
moved the dependencies on Romanian and English
word classes. We applied the ?union?, ?intersection?
and ?refined? symmetrization metrics (Och and Ney,
2003) to the final alignments output from training, as
well as evaluating the two final alignments directly.
We tried to have a strong baseline. GIZA++ has
many free parameters which can not be estimated us-
ing Maximum Likelihood training. We did not use
91
the defaults, but instead used settings which produce
good AER results on French/English bitext. We
also optimized p0 on the 2003 test set (using AER),
rather than using likelihood training. Turning off the
extensions to GIZA++ and training p0 as in (Brown
et al, 1993) produces a substantial increase in AER.
3 Vocabulary Size Reduction
Romanian is a Romance language which has a sys-
tem of suffixes for inflection which is richer than
English. Given the small amount of training data,
we decided that vocabulary size reduction was de-
sirable. As a baseline for vocabulary reduction, we
tried reducing words to prefixes of varying sizes
for both English and Romanian after lowercasing
the corpora. We also tried Porter stemming (Porter,
1997) for English.
(Rogati et al, 2003) extended Model 1 with an ad-
ditional hidden variable to represent the split points
in Arabic between the prefix, the stem and the suf-
fix to generate a stemming for use in Cross-Lingual
Information Retrieval. As in (Rogati et al, 2003),
we can find the most probable stemming given the
model, apply this stemming, and retrain our word
alignment system. However, we can also use the
modified model directly to find the best word align-
ment without converting the text to its stemmed
form.
We introduce a variable rj for the Romanian stem
and a variable sj for the Romanian suffix (which
when concatenated together give us the Romanian
word fj) into the formula for the probability of gen-
erating a Romanian word fj using an alignment aj
given only an English sentence e. We use the index
z to denote a particular stemming possibility. For a
given Romanian word the stemming possibilities are
simply every possible split point where the stem is at
least one character (this includes the null suffix).
p(fj , aj |e) =
?
z
p(rj,z, sj,z, aj |e) (1)
If the assumption is made that the stem and the
suffix are generated independently from e, we can
assume conditional independence.
p(fj , aj |e) =
?
z
p(rj,z, aj |e)p(sj,z, aj |e) (2)
We performed two sets of experiments, one set
where the English was stemmed using the Porter
stemmer and one set where each English word was
stemmed down to its first four characters. We
tried the best performing scoring heuristic for Ara-
bic from (Rogati et al, 2003) where p(sj,z, aj |e) is
modeled using the heuristic p(sj,z|lj) where sj,z is
the Romanian suffix, and lj is the last letter of the
Romanian word fj ; these adjustments are updated
during EM training. We also tried several other ap-
proximations of p(sj,z, aj |e) with and without up-
dates in EM training. We were unable to produce
better results and elected to use the baseline vocab-
ulary reduction technique for the shared task.
4 New Model and Training Algorithm
Our motivation for a new model and a new training
approach which combines likelihood maximization
with error rate minimization is threefold:
? Maximum Likelihood training of Model 4 is
not sufficient to find good alignments
? We would like to model factors not captured by
IBM Model 4
? Using labeled data could help us produce better
alignments, but we have very few labels
We create a new model and train it using an al-
gorithm which has a step which increases likelihood
(like one iteration in the EM algorithm), alternating
with a step which decreases error. We accomplish
this by:
? grouping the parameters of Model 4 into 5 sub-
models
? implementing 6 new submodels
? combining these into a single log-linear model
with 11 weights, ?1 to ?11, which we group
into the vector ?
? defining a search algorithm for finding the
alignment of highest probability given the sub-
models and ?
? devising a method for finding a ? which min-
imizes alignment error given fixed submodels
and a set of gold standard alignments
? inventing a training method for alternating
steps which estimate the submodels by increas-
ing likelihood with steps which set ? to de-
crease alignment error
The submodels in our new alignment model are
listed in table 1, where for ease of exposition we

consider English to be the source language and Ro-
manian the target language.
The log-linear alignment model is specified by
equation 3. The model assigns non-zero proba-
bilities only to 1-to-many alignments, like Model
4. (Cettolo and Federico, 2004) used a log-linear
model trained using error minimization for the trans-
lation task, 3 of the submodels were taken from
Model 4 in a similar way to our first 5 submodels.
p?(a, f |e) =
exp(?m ?mhm(f, a, e))
?
f,e,a exp(
?
m ?mhm(f, a, e))
(3)
Given ?, the alignment search problem is to find
the alignment a of highest probability according to
equation 3. We solve this using the local search de-
fined in (Brown et al, 1993).
We set ? as follows. Given a sequence A of align-
ments we can calculate an error function, E(A). For
these experiments average sentence AER was used.
We wish to minimize this error function, so we se-
lect ? accordingly:
argmin
?
?
a?
E(a?)?(a?, (argmax
a
p?(a, f |e))) (4)
Maximizing performance for all of the weights
at once is not computationally tractable, but (Och,
2003) has described an efficient one-dimensional
search for a similar problem. We search over each
?m (holding the others constant) using this tech-
nique to find the best ?m to update and the best value
to update it to. We repeat the process until no further
gain can be found.
Our new training method is:
REPEAT
? Start with submodels and lambda from previ-
ous iteration
? Find Viterbi alignments on entire training cor-
pus using new model (similar to E-step of
Model 4 training)
? Reestimate submodel parameters from Viterbi
alignments (similar to M-step of Model 4
Viterbi training)
? Find a setting for ? that reduces AER on dis-
criminative training set (new D-step)
We use the first 148 sentences of the 2003 test set
for the discriminative training set. 10 settings for ?
are found, the hypothesis list is augmented using the
results of 10 searches using these settings, and then
another 10 settings for ? are found. We then select
the best ?. The discriminative training regimen is
otherwise similar to (Och, 2003).
5 Experiments
Table 2 provides a comparison of our baseline sys-
tems using the ?refined? symmetrization metric with
the best limited resources track system from WPT03
(Dejean et al, 2003) on the 2003 test set. The best
results are obtained by stemming both English and
Romanian words to the first four letters, as described
in section 2.
Table 3 provides details on our shared task sub-
mission. RUN1 is the word-based baseline system.
RUN2 is the stem-based baseline system. RUN4
uses only the first 6 submodels, while RUN5 uses
all 11 submodels. RUN3 had errors in processing,
so we omit it.
Results:
? Our new 1-to-many alignment model and train-
ing method are successful, producing decreases
of 0.03 AER when the source is Romanian, and
0.01 AER when the source is English.

? These decreases do not translate to a large im-
provement in the end-to-end task of producing
many-to-many alignments with a balanced pre-
cision and recall. We had a very small decrease
of 0.002 AER using the ?refined? heuristic.
? The many-to-many alignments produced using
?union? and the 1-to-1 alignments produced us-
ing ?intersection? were also improved.
? It may be a problem that we trained p0 using
likelihood (it is in submodel 3) rather than op-
timizing p0 discriminatively as we did for the
baseline.
6 Conclusion
? Considering multiple stemming possibilities
for each word seems important.
? Alternating between increasing likelihood and
decreasing error rate is a useful training ap-
proach which can be used for many problems.
? Our model and training method improve upon a
strong baseline for producing 1-to-many align-
ments.
? Our model and training method can be used
with the ?intersection? heuristic to produce
higher quality 1-to-1 alignments
? Models which can directly model many-to-
many alignments and do not require heuristic
symmetrization are needed to produce higher
quality many-to-many alignments. Our train-
ing method can be used to train them.
