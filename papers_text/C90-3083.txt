Abst rac t  
In a natural  dialogue, there are many disturbances in 
the context level because of interruptions and inserted 
sentences. In spite of such phenomena, cohesion is a very 
important idea for understanding the context correctly. 
In our approach, cohesive knowledge which judges  
cohesion between sentences is given to the system and 
then  the knowledge  is used to f ind cohes ion  in 
d isarranged context. I t  is also appl ied to in terpret  
anaphora, ellipsis and pro-forms in the context. In order 
to do so, we define the knowledge and use its definition to 
abstract knowledge fl'om a linguistics database almost 
automatical ly. 
1. In t roduct ion  
When we bui ld a machine t rans lat ion system for 
dialogues, we must face a lot of contextual-phenomena 
such as ellipses, anaphoras and pro-forms. In a dialogue 
these phenomena re more complicated because of many 
disturbances uch as interruptions, inserted sentences 
and utterance disorder. The phenomena have not been 
t reated on the computer  though these phenomena 
in f luence the context -dependent  prob lems such as 
ellipses, anaphoras, pro-forms and referent-transfers. In
this paper, we propose a context processing mechanism 
which fits for the disarranged phenomena, and describe 
the  l ingu is t i c  knowledge ,  ca l led  " loca l  cohes ive  
knowledge",  which is a const ra in t  for grasp ing  the 
contextual relationship. 
In Sect ion 2 we wi l l  g ive examples  which arc 
dependent on the context and then describe the cause of 
difficulty in processing them. In Section 3 we propose 
"local cohesive knowledge" and apply the mechanism in a 
dialogue-machine translation system in Section 4. 
2. Contextua l  Robustness  in l ) ia logues  
Context -depcndent  p rob lems such as e l l ipses ,  
anaphoras, pro-forms and referent-transfers,  present 
complications as shown in Figure 1. 
(1) Anaphora:  the prev ious ut terance  is the same, 
however ,  " i t "  po ints  to the d i f fe rent  te rms,  " the  
registration fee" in Example (1) and "the conference" in 
Example  (2). Therefore  context  is compl icated.  In 
Example 1, the sequences of questions are disordered. In 
Example 2, the answer is a negation for the sentence, "I 
would like ...". 
(2) Ellipsis'. in Example  3, there is an el l ipsis in a 
Japanese sentence, (2) "motte inai no desu ga." The 
F, xample 1 : sent, ence disorder

Example 2 : sententiul negation 
(I) 1 would like to attend the colfferencc. Ilow much is the 
registration fee? 
(2) I'm sorry. ~'s closed. 
l~xample 3 : (in Japanese) 
(1) k gr@tto kaado (credit card,) no (of) namae (name) o(OBJ) 
oshicte kudasai (Could you tell). 
\[ = Could yoti tell me the name of your credit card ?1 
(2) sumimasen (I'm sorry). ~nottc (have) ina~_\[not) no desu ga 
~ .  \[= l'msorry. Idon'thaveacreditcard.l 
Example 4: (in Japanese) 
(l) totlro\[~.uryou. (registration fee) wa (topic) en (yen) de (by) 
shiharatte yoroshii dcshou ka (can I pay). 
\[ = Can I pay the registration fee in yen?l 
(2) doru (U.S. dollars) de (in) ~' ,q i sh i  ?na:s{~ (prg-\['orm = Wc 
\[ = We would like you to pay in US. doIlars,\] 
Figure 1 Examples of contextual phenomena, 
ellipsis depends on the context and means 'credit card'; it 
is both a focus and an object (OBJ). 
(3) Pro-form: in Example 4 (2), "onegaishimasu" is a pro- 
form and means 'We would like you to pay' in Japanese. 
The meaning is dependent on the context. 
We call processing the d i sar ranged phenomena 
"contextual  robustness!~". In order to process such 
phenomena, it is necessary to understand cohesion in a 
context correctly. 
3. l ,oeal cohes ive  knowledge  
We define cohesion in the view of computat iona l  
l inguist ics .  Here cohesion regu la tes  whether  two 
sentences are connected or not. However it does not 
regulate a relationship between two sentences. That is, 
cohesion is a constraint for two sentences. 
\ [The definition of "local cohesive knowledge"\]  
In our approach, "cohesion" is grasped in a context 
with "local cohesive knowledge". It includes not only the 
constraints tbr "local cohesioW~" but also its results such 
as interpretations of ellipses, anaphoras, pro-forms and 
referent-transfers. Therefm'e if constraints are satisfied, 
the in terpreta t ions  are obta ined .  There fore  " local  
cohesive knowledge" has two parts,  "constra ints  for 
cohesion" and "inter-pretations", as follows.

t2. We treat the contextual  phenomena which occur locally, thus 
we use the term, "local cehcsion".

\[ Constra ints  \]
The constra ints  are described as follows. 
verb l  < X1,Y1,Z1 > ,verb2 < X2,Y2,Z2 >.  
In the "verb l<Xl . ,Y1 ,Z l>" ,  "XI" ,  "Y I "  and "ZI"  
means  the case e lements of "verb1"; subjective (SUBJ), 
objective (OSJ) and second objective (oBJg) cases. If two 
sentences are satisf ied with these constraints,  they are 
called "local cohesion" here. As shown in F igure 2, there 
are 18 types, determined by three constra ints  for verbs 
and six constra ints  for nouns.  
Type h the same verbs and the same nouns .  
For example, 
"Could you send me a paper?" 
" \[ sent  you the paper yesterday." 
Both of the verbs in the quest ion sentence and  the 
answer  sentence are the same words, "send". Also, its 
object is the same word, "paper" .  Th is  const ra in t  is 
described as follows. 
send < Xl ,paper ,  Z1 >,  send < X2,paper,Z2 >.  
This  constra int  means  that  if two sentences include 
"send" and its object, "paper", the sentences are cohesive. 
Therefore the following sentences are cohesive because 
they satisfy the same constraint .  
For example, 
"May I send you a paper  to your office?" 
"P lease  send me the paper to my home address." 
send< Xl ,paper,  Z I>,  send< X2,paper,Z2 >.

4. Context  p roeess ing  w i th  loca l  eohes ive  knowledge 
I will now explain the mechan ism which is useful for 
"contextua l  robustness" ,  and  in terpret  contextua l  
phenomena such as anaphoras,  ell ipses and pro-forms. A 
flow of the sys tem is shown in F igure  4. Input ted  
sentences are analyzed with grammar  ules and lexicons, 
based on LexicaLfunct ional  Grammar  (LFG) (1), and then 
intermediate  representat ions ( F-structures of LFG ) are 
obtained. An in termediate  representat ion is converted 
into its skeleton, because it has too much informat ion to 
process for a context, in F igure 5. It  is used to uni fy  with 
"local cohesive knowledge" in the context processing. 
The a lgor i thm of the context processing mechan ism is 
as follows. 
(1) Make a pair  of skeletons: to check the local cohesion, 
br ing the skeletons of the previous utterance and make a 
pair  of skeletons. 
(2) Check the local cohesion: look up the table of "local 
cohesive knowledge" as a key of the pair  of skeletons. I f  
the  pa i r  sa t i s f ies  the const ra in ts  of " local  cohes ive 
knowledge" ,  the  pa i r  is cohes ive  and  then  the

5. The exper iment  
When we built the system, one of the most important 
problems was how to produce the knowledge. We defined 
the local cohesive knowledge and used its definition to 
extract knowledge from a l inguist ics database almost 
automatically. 
We have a l inguist ic  database which inc ludes 60 
keyboard dialogues. The dialogues include 70,000 words 
in total and the number of different words is more than 
3000. These dialogues are analyzed and managed by a 
l inguistic database (P-). 
We extracted local cohesive knowledge  from 60 
dialogues which include 350 verbs and 1000 nouns. First 
we made a table which includes each verb and its noun. 
Then we extracted constraints of local cohesive knowledge 
to make the pair  from the table. Constraint pattern (a), 
a:!~ shown in Figure 3, was obtained automatical ly from 
the data and patterns (b) and (e) were generated from 
pattern (a). We obtained 24531 assert ions o f " loca l  
cohesive knowledge" for types 1, 2 and 3, and 651 
a.,.;:sertions of"local cohesive knowledge" for t.ypes 7, 8 and 
9, We have learned that local cohesive knowledge is very 
sparse.  There fore  the vo lume of " local  cohes ive  
kzmwledge" is not a problem. 
We have implemented the fi'amework as a module of a

context process in a dialogue machine-translation system. 
The system is built on a Lt?G based machine-translation 
system (3). It has 200 grammar ules and more than 3000 
words. It transfers Japanese sentences into English ones. 
It was implemented in Quintus Prolog on a SUN-4 system 
and its program size was 3.4MB. 
An example is shown in Figure 5. 
(1) kurejitto kaado (credit card) no (of) namae 
(name) o (OBJ) oshiete kudasai (Could you tell). 
\[ = Could you tell me the name of credit card. 9\] 
(2) motte (have) inai (not) no desu ga (copula). 
\[ = 1 don't have a credit card. \] 
in the sentence (2) there is an ellipsis. It means 
"kurejitto kaado (credit card)". It points to the modifier in 
the previous entence, "kurejitto kaado no namae ( name 
of credit card)". In this approach, as a results of analysis, 
the skeletons of two sentences are obtained as shown in 
Figure 5. The pair of skeletons are satisfied with the local 
cohesive knowledge (c) in Figure 5. Then the ellipsis is 
obtained as a 'credit card'. 
6. CONCI :US IONS 
To bui ld a "contextua l  robustness"  system,  we 
proposed a context-processing mechanism which analyzed 
the context with "local cohesive knowledge". In order to 
apply the model into a machine-translat ion system, the 
knowledge needs to be produced effectively. Therefore we 
defined 18 types of" local cohesive knowledge" and used 
this definition to abstract knowledge from a linguistics 
database almost automatically. Some of the 18 types were 
implemented on a machine translation system. The other 
types were not  generated ,  because they inc ludes  
synonyms. In l, he future, we will construet hem with a 
thesaurus  and also extend the context  process ing 
algorithm to process more complicated phenomena such 
as parallel phrases.
