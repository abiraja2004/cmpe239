Abstract 
Words and character-bigrams are both 
used as features in Chinese text process-
ing tasks, but no systematic comparison 
or analysis of their values as features for 
Chinese text categorization has been re-
ported heretofore. We carry out here a 
full performance comparison between 
them by experiments on various docu-
ment collections (including a manually 
word-segmented corpus as a golden stan-
dard), and a semi-quantitative analysis to 
elucidate the characteristics of their be-
havior; and try to provide some prelimi-
nary clue for feature term choice (in most 
cases, character-bigrams are better than 
words) and dimensionality setting in text 
categorization systems. 
1 Introduction1 
Because of the popularity of the Vector Space 
Model (VSM) in text information processing, 
document indexing (term extraction) acts as a 
pre-requisite step in most text information proc-
essing tasks such as Information Retrieval 
(Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) and Text 
Categorization (Sebastiani, 2002). It is empiri-
cally known that the indexing scheme is a non-
trivial complication to system performance, es-
pecially for some Asian languages in which there 
are no explicit word margins and even no natural 
semantic unit. Concretely, in Chinese Text Cate-
gorization tasks, the two most important index-

ing units (feature terms) are word and character-
bigram, so the problem is: which kind of terms2 
should be chosen as the feature terms, words or 
character-bigrams? 
To obtain an all-sided idea about feature 
choice beforehand,  we review here the possible 
feature variants (or, options). First, at the word 
level, we can do stemming, do stop-word prun-
ing, include POS (Part of Speech) information, 
etc. Second, term combinations (such as ?word-
bigram?, ?word + word-bigram?, ?character-
bigram + character-trigram?3, etc.) can also be 
used as features (Nie et al, 2000). But, for Chi-
nese Text Categorization, the ?word or bigram? 
question is fundamental. They have quite differ-
ent characteristics (e.g. bigrams overlap each 
other in text, but words do not) and influence the 
classification performance in different ways. 
In Information Retrieval, it is reported that bi-
gram indexing schemes outperforms word 
schemes to some or little extent (Luk and Kwok, 
1997; Leong and Zhou 1998; Nie et al, 2000). 
Few similar comparative studies have been re-
ported for Text Categorization (Li et al, 2003) so 
far in literature. 
Text categorization and Information Retrieval 
are tasks that sometimes share identical aspects 
(Sebastiani, 2002) apart from term extraction 
(document indexing), such as tfidf term weight-
ing and performance evaluation. Nevertheless, 
they are different tasks. One of the generally ac-
cepted connections between Information Re-
trieval and Text Categorization is that an infor-
mation retrieval task could be partially taken as a 
binary classification problem with the query as 
the only positive training document. From this 
                                                 
2 The terminology ?term? stands for both word and charac-
ter-bigram. Term or  combination of terms (in word-bigram 
or other forms) might be chosen as ?feature?. 
3 The terminology ?character? stands for Chinese character, 
and ?bigram? stands for character-bigram in this paper.

viewpoint, an IR task and a general TC task have 
a large difference in granularity. To better illus-
trate this difference, an example is present here. 
The words ????(film producer)? and ???
?(dubbed film)? should be taken as different 
terms in an IR task because a document with one 
would not necessarily be a good match for a 
query with the other, so the bigram ???(film 
production)? is semantically not a shared part of 
these two words, i.e. not an appropriate feature 
term. But in a Text Categorization task, both 
words might have a similar meaning at the cate-
gory level (?film? category, generally), which 
enables us to regard the bigram ???? as a se-
mantically acceptable representative word snip-
pet for them, or for the category. 
There are also differences in some other as-
pects of IR and TC. So it is significant to make a 
detailed comparison and analysis here on the 
relative value of words and bigrams as features 
in Text Categorization. The organization of this 
paper is as follows: Section 2 shows some ex-
periments on different document collections to 
observe the common trends in the performance 
curves of the word-scheme and bigram-scheme; 
Section 3 qualitatively analyses these trends; 
Section 4 makes some statistical analysis to cor-
roborate the issues addressed in Section 3; Sec-
tion 5 summarizes the results and concludes. 
2 Performance Comparison 
Three document collections in Chinese language 
are used in this study. 
The electronic version of Chinese Encyclo-
pedia (?CE?): It has 55 subject categories and 
71674 single-labeled documents (entries). It is 
randomly split by a proportion of 9:1 into a train-
ing set with 64533 documents and a test set with 
7141 documents. Every document has the full-
text. This data collection does not have much of 
a sparseness problem. 
The training data from a national Chinese 
text categorization evaluation4 (?CTC?): It has 
36 subject categories and 3600 single-labeled5 
documents. It is randomly split by a proportion 
of 4:1 into a training set with 2800 documents 
and a test set with 720 documents. Documents in 
this data collection are from various sources in-
cluding news websites, and some documents

5 In the original document collection, a document might 
have a secondary category label. In this study, only the pri-
mary category label is reserved. 
may be very short. This data collection has a 
moderate sparseness problem. 
A manually word-segmented corpus from 
the State Language Affairs Commission 
(?LC?): It has more than 100 categories and 
more than 20000 single-labeled documents6. In 
this study, we choose a subset of 12 categories 
with the most documents (totally 2022 docu-
ments). It is randomly split by a proportion of 2:1 
into a training set and a test set. Every document 
has the full-text and has been entirely word-
segmented7 by hand (which could be regarded as 
a golden standard of segmentation). 
All experiments in this study are carried out at 
various feature space dimensionalities to show 
the scalability. Classifiers used in this study are 
Rocchio and SVM. All experiments here are 
multi-class tasks and each document is assigned 
a single category label. 
The outline of this section is as follows: Sub-
section 2.1 shows experiments based on the Roc-
chio classifier, feature selection schemes besides 
Chi and term weighting schemes besides tfidf to 
compare the automatic segmented word features 
with bigram features on CE and CTC, and both 
document collections lead to similar behaviors; 
Subsection 2.2 shows experiments on CE by a 
SVM classifier,  in which, unlike with the Roc-
chio method, Chi feature selection scheme and 
tfidf term weighting scheme outperform other 
schemes; Subsection 2.3 shows experiments by a 
SVM classifier with Chi feature selection and 
tfidf term weighting on LC (manual word seg-
mentation) to compare the best word features 
with bigram features. 
2.1 The Rocchio Method and Various Set-
tings 
The Rocchio method is rooted in the IR tradition, 
and is very different from machine learning ones 
(such as SVM) (Joachims, 1997; Sebastiani, 
2002). Therefore, we choose it here as one of the 
representative classifiers to be examined. In the 
experiment, the control parameter of negative 
examples is set to 0, so this Rocchio based classi-
fier is in fact a centroid-based classifier. 
Chimax is a state-of-the-art feature selection 
criterion for dimensionality reduction (Yang and 
Peterson, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002). Chi-
max*CIG (Xue and Sun, 2003a) is reported to be 
better in Chinese text categorization by a cen-

are not used in this study.

troid based classifier, so we choose it as another 
representative feature selection criterion besides 
Chimax. 
Likewise, as for term weighting schemes, in 
addition to tfidf, the state of the art (Baeza-Yates 
and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), we also choose 
tfidf*CIG (Xue and Sun, 2003b). 
Two word segmentation schemes are used for 
the word-indexing of documents. One is the 
maximum match algorithm (?mmword? in the 
figures), which is a representative of simple and 
fast word segmentation algorithms.  The other is 
ICTCLAS8 (?lqword? in the figures). ICTCLAS 
is one of the best word segmentation systems 
(SIGHAN 2003) and reaches a segmentation 
precision of more than 97%, so we choose it as a 
representative of state-of-the-art schemes for 
automatic word-indexing of document). 
For evaluation of single-label classifications,  
F1-measure, precision, recall and accuracy 
(Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Sebastiani, 
2002) have the same value by microaveraging9, 
and are labeled with ?performance? in the fol-
lowing figures.

ities (less than 10000 dimensions), while the CIG 
version is better at high dimensionalities and 
reaches a higher limit.10

Figure 2 shows the same group of curves for 
the CTC document collection. The curves fluctu-
ate more than the curves for the CE collection 
because of sparseness; The CE collection is more 
sensitive to the additions of terms that come with 
the increase of dimensionality. The CE curves in 
the following figures show similar fluctuations 
for the same reason. 
For a parallel comparison among mmword, 
lqword and bigram schemes, the curves in  Fig-

the following is satisfied: (a) every curve has shown its 
zenith; (b) only one curve is not complete and has shown a 
higher zenith than other curves; (c) a margin line is shown 
to indicate the limit of the incomplete curve. 
547
We can see that the lqword scheme outper-
forms the mmword scheme at almost any dimen-
sionality, which means the more precise the word 
segmentation the better the classification per-
formance. At the same time, the bigram scheme 
outperforms both of the word schemes on a high 
dimensionality, wherea the word schemes might 
outperform the bigram scheme on a low dimen-
sionality. 
Till now, the experiments on CE and CTC 
show the same characteristics despite the per-
formance fluctuation on CTC caused by sparse-
ness. Hence in the next subsections CE is used 
instead of both of them because its curves are 
smoother. 
2.2 SVM on Words and Bigrams 
As stated in the previous subsection, the lqword 
scheme always outperforms the mmword scheme; 
we compare here only the lqword scheme with 
the bigram scheme.  
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the 
best classifiers at present (Vapnik, 1995; 
Joachims, 1998), so we choose it as the main 
classifier in this study. The SVM implementation 
used here is LIBSVM (Chang, 2001); the type of 
SVM is set to ?C-SVC? and the kernel type is set 
to linear, which means a one-with-one scheme is 
used in the multi-class classification. 
Because the CIG?s effectiveness on a SVM 
classifier is not examined in Xue and Sun (2003a, 
2003b)?s report, we make here the four combina-
tions of schemes with and without CIG in feature 
selection and term weighting. The experiment 
results are shown in Figure 5. The collection 
used is CE.

Figure 5. chi-tfidf and cig-involved approaches

Here we find that the chi-tfidf combination 
outperforms any approach with CIG, which is the 
opposite of the results with the Rocchio method. 
And the results with SVM are all better than the 
results with the Rocchio method. So we find that 
the feature selection scheme and the term 
weighting scheme are related to the classifier, 
which is worth noting. In other words, no feature 
selection scheme or term weighting scheme is 
absolutely the best for all classifiers. Therefore, a 
reasonable choice is to select the best performing 
combination of feature selection scheme, term 
weighting scheme and classifier, i.e. chi-tfidf and 
SVM. The curves for the lqword scheme and the 
bigram scheme are redrawn in Figure 6 to make 
them clearer.

Figure 6. lqword and bigram on CE 
The curves shown in Figure 6 are similar to 
those in Figure 3. The differences are: (a) a lar-
ger dimensionality is needed for the bigram 
scheme to start outperforming the lqword scheme; 
(b) the two schemes have a smaller performance 
gap. 
The lqword scheme reaches its top perform-
ance at a dimensionality of around 40000, and 
the bigram scheme reaches its top performance 
at a dimensionality of around 60000 to 70000, 
after which both schemes? performances slowly 
decrease. The reason is that the low ranked terms 
in feature selection are in fact noise and do not 
help to classification, which is why the feature 
selection phase is necessary.

Up to now, bigram features seem to be better 
than word ones for fairly large dimensionalities. 
But it appears that word segmentation precision 
impacts classification performance. So we 
choose here a fully manually segmented docu-
ment collection to detect the best performance a 
word scheme could  reach and compare it with 
the bigram scheme. 
Figure 7 shows such an experiment result on 
the LC document collection (the circles indicate 
the maximums and the dash-dot lines indicate the 
superior limit and the asymptotic interior limit of 
the bigram scheme). The word scheme reaches a 
top performance around the dimensionality of 
20000, which is a little higher than the bigram 
scheme?s zenith around 70000. 
Besides this experiment on 12 categories of 
the LC document collection, some experiments 
on fewer (2 to 6) categories of this subset were 
also done, and showed similar behaviors. The 
word scheme shows a better performance than 
the bigram scheme and needs a much lower di-
mensionality. The simpler the classification task 
is, the more distinct this behavior is. 
3 Qualitative Analysis 
To analyze the performance of words and bi-
grams as feature terms in Chinese text categori-
zation, we need to investigate two aspects as fol-
lows. 
3.1 An Individual Feature Perspective 
The word is a natural semantic unit in Chinese 
language and expresses a complete meaning in 
text. The bigram is not a natural semantic unit 
and might not express a complete meaning in 
text, but there are also reasons for the bigram to 
be a good feature term. 
First, two-character words and three-character 
words account for most of all multi-character 
Chinese words (Liu and Liang, 1986). A two-
character word can be substituted by the same 
bigram. At the granularity of most categorization 
tasks, a three-character words can often be sub-
stituted by one of its sub-bigrams (namely the 
?intraword bigram? in the next section)  without 
a change of meaning. For instance, ???? is a 
sub-bigram of the word ????(tournament)? 
and could represent it without ambiguity. 
Second, a bigram may overlap on two succes-
sive words (namely the ?interword bigram? in 
the next section), and thus to some extent fills the 
role of a word-bigram. The word-bigram as a 
more definite (although more sparse) feature  
surely helps the classification. For instance, ??
?? is a bigram overlapping on the two succes-
sive words ? ? ? (weather)? and ? ? ?
(forecast)?, and could almost replace the word-
bigram (also a phrase) ?????(weather fore-
cast)?, which is more likely to be a representative 
feature of the category ????(meteorology)? 
than either word. 
Third, due to the first issue, bigram features 
have some capability of identifying OOV (out-
of-vocabulary) words 11 , and help improve the 
recall of classification. 
The above issues state the advantages of bi-
grams compared with words. But in the first and 
second issue, the equivalence between bigram 
and word or word-bigram is not perfect. For in-
stance, the word ???(literature)? is a also sub-
bigram of the word ????(astronomy)?, but 
their meanings are completely different. So the 
loss and distortion of semantic information is a 
disadvantage of bigram features over word fea-
tures.  
Furthermore, one-character words cover about 
7% of words and more than 30% of word occur-
rences in the Chinese language; they are effev-
tive in the word scheme and are not involved in 
the above issues. Note that the impact of effec-
tive one-character words on the classification is 
not as large as their total frequency, because the 
high frequency ones are often too common to 
have a good classification power, for instance, 
the word ?? (of, ?s)?. 
3.2 A Mass Feature Perspective 
Features are not independently acting in text 
classification. They are assembled together to 
constitute a feature space. Except for a few mod-
els such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) 
(Deerwester et al, 1990), most models assume 
the feature space to be orthogonal. This assump-
tion might not affect the effectiveness of the 
models, but the semantic redundancy and com-
plementation among the feature terms do impact 
on the classification efficiency at a given dimen-
sionality. 
According to the first issue addressed in the 
previous subsection, a bigram might cover for 
more than one word. For instance, the bigram 
???? is a sub-bigram of the words ???
(fabric)?,???? (cotton fabric)?, ????
(knitted fabric)?, and also a good substitute of 
                                                 
11 The ?OOV words? in this paper stand for the words that 
occur in the test documents but not in the training document. 
549
them. So, to a certain extent, word features are 
redundant with regard to the bigram features as-
sociated to them. Similarly, according to the sec-
ond issue addressed, a bigram might cover for 
more than one word-bigram. For instance, the 
bigram ???? is a sub-bigram of the word-
bigrams (phrases) ?????(short story)?, ??
???(novelette)?, ?????(novel)? and also 
a good substitute for them. So, as an addition to 
the second issue stated in the previous subsection, 
a bigram feature might even cover for more than 
one word-bigram. 
On the other hand, bigrams features are also 
redundant with regard to word features associ-
ated with them. For instance, the ???? and ??
?? are both sub-bigrams of the previously men-
tioned word ?????. In some cases, more than 
one sub-bigram can be a good representative of a 
word. 
We make a word list and a bigram list sorted 
by the feature selection criterion in a descending 
order. We now try to find how the relative re-
dundancy degrees of the word list and the bigram 
list vary with the dimensionality. Following is-
sues are elicited by an observation on the two 
lists (not shown here due to space limitations). 
The relative redundancy rate in the word list 
keeps even while the dimensionality varies to a 
certain extent, because words that share a com-
mon sub-bigram might not have similar statistics 
and thus be scattered in the word feature list. 
Note that these words are possibly ranked lower 
in the list than the sub-bigram because feature 
selection criteria (such as Chi) often prefer 
higher frequency terms to lower frequency ones, 
and every word containing the bigram certainly 
has a lower frequency than the bigram itself. 
The relative redundancy in the bigram list 
might be not as even as in the word list. Good 
(representative) sub-bigrams of a word are quite 
likely to be ranked close to the word itself. For 
instance, ???? and ???? are sub-bigrams of 
the word ????(music composer)?, both the 
bigrams and the word are on the top of the lists. 
Theretofore, the bigram list has a relatively large 
redundancy rate at low dimensionalities. The 
redundancy rate should decrease along with the 
increas of dimensionality for: (a) the relative re-
dundancy in the word list counteracts the redun-
dancy in the bigram list, because the words that 
contain a same bigram are gradually included as 
the dimensionality increases; (b) the proportion 
of interword bigrams increases in the bigram list 
and there is generally no redundancy between 
interword bigrams and intraword bigrams. 
Last, there are more bigram features than word 
features because bigrams can overlap each other 
in the text but words can not. Thus the bigrams 
as a whole should theoretically contain more in-
formation than the words as a whole. 
From the above analysis and observations, bi-
gram features are expected to outperform word 
features at high dimensionalities. And word fea-
tures are expected to outperform bigram features 
at low dimensionalities.  
4 Semi-Quantitative Analysis 
In this section, a preliminary statistical analysis 
is presented to corroborate the statements in the 
above qualitative analysis and expected to be 
identical with the experiment results shown in 
Section 1. All statistics in this section are based 
on the CE document collection and the lqword 
segmentation scheme (because the CE document 
collection is large enough to provide good statis-
tical characteristics). 
4.1 Intraword Bigrams and Interword Bi-
grams 
In the previous section, only the intraword bi-
grams were discussed together with the words. 
But every bigram may have both intraword oc-
currences and interword occurrences. Therefore 
we need to distinguish these two kinds of bi-
grams at a statistical level. For every bigram, the 
number of intraword occurrences and the number 
of interword occurrences are counted and we can 
use

+? ?? ?+? ?  
as a metric to indicate its natual propensity to be 
a intraword bigram. The probability density of 
bigrams about on this metric is shown in Figure

The figure shows a mixture of two Gaussian 
distributions, the left one for ?natural interword 
bigrams? and the right one for ?natural intraword 
bigrams?. We can moderately distinguish these 
two kinds of bigrams by a division at -1.4. 
4.2 Overall Information Quantity of a Fea-
ture Space 
The performance limit of a classification is re-
lated to the quantity of information used. So a 
quantitative metric of the information a feature 
space can provide is need. Feature Quantity (Ai-
zawa, 2000) is suitable for this purpose because 
it comes from information theory and is additive; 
tfidf was also reported as an appropriate metric of 
feature quantity (defined as ?probability ? infor-
mation?). Because of the probability involved as 
a factor, the overall information provided by a 
feature space can be calculated on training data 
by summation. 
The redundancy and complementation men-
tioned in Subsection 3.2 must be taken into ac-
count in the calculation of overall information 
quantity. For bigrams, the redundancy with re-
gard to words associated with them between two 
intraword bigrams is given by 
 { }
1,2
1 2( ) min ( ), ( )
b w
tf w idf b idf b
?
??  
in which b1 and b2 stand for the two bigrams and 
w stands for any word containing both of them. 
The overall information quantity is obtained by 
subtracting the redundancy between each pair of 
bigrams from the sum of all features? feature 
quantity (tfidf). Redundancy among more than 
two bigrams is ignored. For words, there is only 
complementation among words but not redun-
dancy, the complementation with regard to bi-
grams associated with them is given by 
 
{ } if  exists;
if  does not exists.
( ) min ( ) ,
( ) ( ),

in which b is an intraword bigram contained by 
w. The overall information is calculated by 
summing the complementations of all words. 
4.3 Statistics and Discussion 
Figure 9 shows the variation of these overall in-
formation metrics on the CE document collection. 
It corroborates the characteristics analyzed in 
Section 3 and corresponds with the performance 
curves in Section 2.  
Figure 10 shows the proportion of interword 
bigrams at different dimensionalities, which also 
corresponds with the analysis in Section 3.

The curves do not cross at exactly the same 
dimensionality as in the figures in Section 1, be-
cause other complications impact on the classifi-
cation performance: (a) OOV word identifying 
capability, as stated in Subsection 3.1; (b) word 
segmentation precision; (c) granularity of the 
categories (words have more definite semantic 
meaning than bigrams and lead to a better per-
formance for small category granularities); (d) 
noise terms, introduced in the feature space dur-
ing the increase of dimensionality. With these 
factors, the actual curves would not keep increas-
ing as they do in Figure 9.

5 Conclusion 
In this paper, we aimed to thoroughly compare 
the value of words and bigrams as feature terms 
in text categorization, and make the implicit 
mechanism explicit. 
Experimental comparison showed that the Chi 
feature selection scheme and the tfidf term 
weighting scheme are still the best choices for 
(Chinese) text categorization on a SVM classifier. 
In most cases, the bigram scheme outperforms 
the word scheme at high dimensionalities and 
usually reaches its top performance at a dimen-
551
sionality of around 70000. The word scheme of-
ten outperforms the bigram scheme at low di-
mensionalities and reaches its top performance at 
a dimensionality of less than 40000. 
Whether the best performance of the word 
scheme is higher than the best performance 
scheme depends considerably on the word seg-
mentation precision and the number of categories. 
The word scheme performs better with a higher 
word segmentation precision and fewer (<10) 
categories. 
A word scheme costs more document indexing 
time than a bigram scheme does; however a bi-
gram scheme costs more training time and classi-
fication time than a word scheme does at the 
same performance level due to its higher dimen-
sionality. Considering that the document index-
ing is needed in both the training phase and the 
classification phase, a high precision word 
scheme is more time consuming as a whole than 
a bigram scheme. 
As a concluding suggestion: a word scheme is 
more fit for small-scale tasks (with no more than 
10 categories and no strict classification speed 
requirements) and needs a high precision word 
segmentation system; a bigram scheme is more 
fit for large-scale tasks (with dozens of catego-
ries or even more) without too strict training 
speed requirements (because a high dimensional-
ity and a large number of categories lead to a 
long training time).
