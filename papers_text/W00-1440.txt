Appendix I I :  Discussion Panel on Evaluation 
Research 
in Generation 
Moderator: Inderjeet Mani 
Evaluation is critical in offering feedback on progress_toboth developers andpotential consumers 
of NLG technology. However, evaluation has thus far not been as well-established in NLG as it 
has become in NLU. This panel will discuss evaluation methods and resources. It is aimed at 
building a better understanding ofNLG evaluation methods, and hopefully arriving at steps to 
facilitate future evaluations. 
Applicable evaluation methods can be derived from work in NLG as well as Text Summarization 
and Machine Translation. The evaluation methods include intrinsic methods which test the 
generation system in itself, and extrinsic methods which test the generation system in relation to 
some other task. 
Intrinsic methods can include assessing coverage of different varieties of generation input, the 
quality of the generated output, and comparison of generated output against reference output at 
some level (e.g., by using subjective grading, comparison against emplates, or comparing human 
correctness in answering questions based on each type of output, etc.) Of course, a fundamental 
problem in evaluating NLG is that there may be many acceptable outputs. 
Extrinsic methods can include measuring efficiency in executing enerated instructions (e.g., how 
easy was it to install the component by following the generated manual?), assessing the relevance 
of generated output o some information eed or goal (e.g., are the generated business letters 
effective?), its impact on a system in which it is embedded (e.g., how much does the generation 
help the question answering system?), measuring the amount of effort required to post-edit the 
output (e.g., how much do the generated briefings need to be fixed up?), etc. 
As the generation technology becomes more mature, it is useful to assess end-user acceptability 
of generated output, extensibility and portability, throughput, cost-benefit measures, etc. it is also 
interesting for evaluations address both features important to the overall task, as well as features 
unique to NL generation. 
Participants will address the following issues: 
1. What evaluation methods are applicable to NLG? 
2. What are the pros and cons of NLG evaluations you have carried out? 
3. Can we construct corpora to help evaluate NLG systems? 
4. What steps can we collectively take to improve the role of evaluation in NLG?
