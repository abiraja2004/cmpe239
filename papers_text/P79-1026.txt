Abstract: A "Front End" for a Computer-Based Glaucoma 
Consultation System is described. The system views a 
case as a description of a particular instance of a class 
of concepts called "structured objects" and builds up a 
representation of the instance from the sentences in the 
case. The information required by the consultation 
system is then extracted and passed on to the 
consultation system in the appropriately coded form. A 
core of syntactlc, semantic end contextual rules which 
are applicable to all structured objects is being 
developed together with a representation of the 
structured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT. There is also a 
facility for add ing  domain dependent  syntax, 
abbreviations and defaults. 
system that has a core of syntax and semantics that is 
app l i cab le  to all s t ructured  ob jec ts  and wh ich  can  be  
extended by  domain  spec i f i c  syntax ,  id ioms and defau l ts .  
Cons iderab le  work  on the  in terpretat ion  o f  hosp i ta l  
discharge summaries, which are very similar to  case 
descr ip t ions ,  has  been done by  a group  at  NYU 
\[Sager 1978\]. Their work has focused on the  creation of 
formatted data bases for subsequent question answering 
and is syntax based. The research reported here is 
concerned with ext ract ing  from the  case the information 
understandable by a consultation system and is primarily 
knowledge based .  
I. STRUCTURED OBJECTS 
During the  past decade a number of Medical Consultation 
systems have been developed, for example INTERNIST 
\[Pople. Myers and Miller 1973\], CASNET/GLAUCOMA 
\[Weiss st. al. 1978\], MYCIN \[Shortliffe 1976\]. Currently 
still others are being developed. Some of these programs 
are reaching a stage where they are being used in 
hospitals and clinics. Such use brings with it the need 
for fast and natural communication with these programs 
for the reporting of the "clinical state" of the patient. 
This includes laboratory f ind ings ,  symptoms, medications 
and certain history data. Ideally the reporting would be 
done by speech but this is currently beyond the state of 
the art in speech understanding. A more reasonable goal 
is to try to capture the physicians" written "Natural 
Language" for describing patients and to write programs 
to convert these descriptions to the appropriate coded 
input to the consultation systems. 
The original motivation for this research came from the 
desire to have natural language input of cases to 
CASNET/GLAUCOMA a computer-based glaucoma consultation 
system developed at Retgers University. A case is 
several paragraphs of sentences , written by a physician, 
which describe a patient who has glaucoma or who is 
suspected of having glaucoma. It was desired to have a 
"Natural Language Front-End" which could interpret the 
cases and pass the content to the consultation system. 
In the  beg inn ing  stages it was by no means clear that it 
would even be possible to have a "front end" since it was 
expected that some sophisticated knowledge of Glaucoma 
would be necessary  and that  feedback  from the 
consu l ta t ion  sys tem would be  requ i red  in  unders tand ing  
the  input  sentences .  However dur ing  the  course  o f  the  
investigation it became clear that  certain 
generalizations could be made from the domain of 
Glaucoma. The key discovery was that under some 
reasonable assumptions the physic iane notes could be 
viewed as descriptions of instances of a class of 
concepts called structured oblects and the knowledge 
needed to interpret the notes was mostly knowledge of the 
relationship between language and structured objects 
rather than knowledge of Glaucoma. 
This observation changed the focus of the research 
somm~at  - to the investigation of the relationship 
between language and s t ructured  ob jec ts  w i th  par t i cu la r  
emphas is  on  the  s t ructured  ob jec t  GLAUCOMA-PATIENTo Th is  
change o f  focus  has  resu l ted  in  the  deve lopment  o f  a 
A s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  l i ke  a template  \ [S r idharan  1978\] 
o r  un i t  \ [gobrow and Winograd  1977\] or  concept  
\[Brachman 1978\] in that  i t  implicitly defines a set  of 
instances. It is characterized by a biererchial 
structure. This structure consists of other structured 
ob jects  which are  components (not  sub-concepts \ [ ) .  For  
example the s t ructured  ob Ject  PATIENT-LEFT-EYE i s  a 
component of the structured object PATIENT. Structured 
objects also have attributes, for exemple PATIENT-SEX is 
an attribute of PATIENT. Attributes can have numeric or 
non-nemeric vAlues. Each attribute has an associated 
"measurement concept" which defines the set of legal 
values, units etc. 
A s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  represented  as  a .  d i rec ted  graph 
~here  nodes  represent  components  and a t t r ibutes ,  and arcs  
represent relations between the concept* and its 
components. The graph has a distinguished node, 
analogous to the root of a tree, whose label is the name 
of the concept. All incoming errs to the concept enter 
only at this distinguished or "head" node. Figure I is a 
diagram of part of the structured object GLAUCOMA- 
PATIENT. There are only a limited number of relations? 
These are: 
ATTR This denotes an attribute llnk. 
MBY Associates an attribute with  its measurement. 
PART The PART relation holds between two concepts. 
CONT The CONTAINS re la t ion  holds between two concepts .  
ASS An ASSOCIATION llnk. Some relations, such as the 
relation between PATIENT and PATIENT-MEDICATION 
cannot be characterized aa ATTR, PART or CONT but 
are more complex, as shown by the followln$ 
examples: 
the age of the patient (ATTR) (I) 
The medication of the patient (ASS) (2) 
The patient is receiving medication (ASS) (3) 
The patient is receiving age (?) (4) 
Al though the  re la t ion  between PATIENT and PATIENT- 
MEDICATION has  some sur face  fo rms that  make i t  l ook  
like an ATTR re la t ion  th i s  is not  rea l ly  the case. 
A "true" s t ructured  ob jec t  would not  have  ASS links 
but  they  must  be  in t roduced to  dea l  w i th  GLAUCOMA- 
PATIENT. the  formal semantics of the ASS relation 
are very similar to those of the ATTR and PART 
relations.

PATIENT-gYE, not an Instanceo CI-PATIENT-LEFT-gYE and 
C2-PATTENT-~IGHT-EYE are two different concepts t that is 
they have d/~Joint sub-structure; they are as different 
to the system as C-AiM and C-LEG. There i s  8nod reason 
for this. It is possible that a different Instrument 
will be needed to measure the value of an attribute in 
the right eye than in the taft aye. Thls means that the 
measurement concepts got these attrlbutee will have to he 
d i f fe rent  fo r  the le f t  and r ight  eyes .  Another example 
from the d~a in  of  slancoma show th i s  more v iv id ly .  CI -  
PATIENT-LEYT-~YE-VISUAL-FIELD-~COTCMA denotes  a scotoma 
in the left eye. A particular type of scotoma is the 
arcuate  (bow-shaped) scotoma. This must be a separate  
concept s ince  i t  is meaninsful to suty "double a rcuste  
scotoma" but not "doubte scotoma", This means that the 
concept C .... -FIELD-AACUATE-SCOTflMA has an attribute ~hat 
cannot be inher i ted  from C..,-~IELD-SCOTOMA. I f  a 
measurement concept i s  the alune for  hor~ eyes (or any

There are many more levels of "sub-conceptlng" chat could 
be represented here but it is not necessary for the 
interpretation of the cases. Only those mechanisms for 
manipulating structured objects that are necessary for 
the interpretation of cases are beln E implemented. 
Brachmen \[Brachman 1978\] has examined the problems of 
representing concepts in considerably more detail. 
I. 1 MEASL~EMENT CONCEPTS 
Measurements are associated with  those  nodes of the  graph 
Chat have Ineomln8 ATTR ~rcs.  There are twn kinds of 
measurements those with numerical values and those with 
non-n~er lcn l  values. Numerical measurements have the 
followln E internal structure: 
RANGE A pair of numbers that speclfy the range. 
UNITS A set of units for the measurement. 
QVALSET A set of qualitative values for the measurement. 
TIME A dace or one of the values PAST, PRESENT. 
INSTR A set of possible instruments for taking the 
maeaur amen, ? 
CF A confidence fac tor  o r  measure of reliability fo r  
the measurement. 
There is also soma procedural knnwledge assoclatad with 
measurm-ents. This relates numerical values to 
quantitative values, fellah Ill,lea with instruments etc. 
An example  of a measurement concept  is given i n  figure 2.

Fi~ur e 2 
The Measurement Concept for Intra-ocular Pressure 
Items prefixed with  a ~ "K 't in figure 2 denote constants. 
Constants are "terminal items" having no further 
definition in the representation of the structured 
object. 
number of instances is known beforehand, for example 
there can only be one instance of CI-PATIENT~.EFT-EYE0 
while in other cases the number of instances is 
determined by the input, for example measurements of 
In,re-ocular pressure at different times are different 
instances. Instances are created along a number of 
dimensions, the most common one being TIME, for example 
pressure today, pressure on Mar 23. When different 
instruments are used to take measurements  this 
constitutes a second dimension for instances. The rules 
of instantlatlon are embedded in the core. 
A partial instantiation of CI-PATIENT can be done before 
the first sentence is processed by tracing links marked 
NECESSARY. Any component or attribute ins,an,laced at 
this stage will be introduced by a definite noun phrase 
while optional components will be introduced by 
indefinite noun phrases. 
2. SEMANTICS 
A fundamental assumption that has been made and one that 
is Justlfled by examination of several sets of cases is 
that the sentences dascrlbe an instance of a patient with  
the assumption that the reader already knows the concept. 
None of the sentences in the notes examined had an 
interpretation which would requlre updating the concept 
GLAUCCMA-PATIENT. The interpretation of a case is thus 
consldared to be the construction of the  the 
corresponding instance of GLAUCOMA-PATIENT. 
The nature of structured objects as outlined above 
dlccataa that only two fundamental kinds of assertions 
are expected in sentences. There wlll either be an 
assertion about the existence of an optional component as 
in (5) or about the value of an attribute as in (6) and 
(7) ? 
There Is an arcuete scotoma od.** 
The pressure is 20 in the left eye. 
The pressure is normal os. 
(5) 
(6)  
(7)  
Vary few of the sentences contain Just one assertion, 
most contain several as in (8) and (9). 
There is a nasal step and an arcuete 
scotoma in the left eye and a central 
island in the right eye (8)  
~he medication is I0 percent pilocarplne 
daily in both eyes. (9) 
2. I THE MEANING OF A SENTENCE 
Even though sentences are viewed as containing assertions 
their meanings can be represented as sets of instances, 
Non-nmnerlcal measurements differ from numerical given that there is a procedure which takes these 
measurements in that RANGE, UNIT and QVALSET are replaced instances and incorporates them into the growing instance 
by VALSET. One or more members of VALSET are to be of GLAUCOMA-PATIENT. Ibis is due to the tree structure 
selected in creating an instance of the measurement of instances since Instantlatlon of a concept involves 
concept, for example: Instantlatlon of all concepts between itself and the 
root. In fact, many sentences in the cases do not even 
CI-PATIENT-SEX-MSMT VALSET (ONEOF K-MALE K-FEMALE) contain a relation but merely assert the existence of an 
instance or of an attribute value as in (I0) and (\[1). 
I. 2 INSTANCES 
An ins tance  o f  a s t ruc tured  ob jec t  i s  represented  as a

Information trickles in from the case. In some cases the

** Opthalmologlsts frequently use the abbreviations "ed" 
for "in the right eye", "os" for "in the left eye" and 
"ou" for "in hor/1 ayes" 
105 
2.2 PROVISIONAL INSTANCES 
Any particular noun or  adjective could refer to a number 
of different concepts. "Medication" for" example could 
refer to CI-PATIENT-MEDICATION, CI-PATIENT-&IGHT-EYE- 
MEDICATION or (I-PATIENT-LEFT-EYE-MEDICATION. Moreover 
in any particular use it cou ld  be  referring Co one or  
more of its possible referents. In (t2) 
Medicacion consists of diamox 
and pllocarpine drops in both  eyes. (12) 
"medication" refers co all of its possible referents 
since d iamox is not  given to  the eye but  is taken orally. 
In addition to this, ic ?s generally not possible to know 
at the clme of encountering a word whether it refers to 
an existing Instance or to a new instance. This is due 
to the fact thaC at the time of encountering a reference 
to a concept all of the values of the instance dimensions 
mlghc not be known. The mechanism for dealing with these 
problems is Co assign "provisional Instances" as the 
referents of words end phrases when they are scanned 
during the parse and to turn these provisional instances 
Into "real" instances when the correct parse has been 
found. This involves finding the values of the instance 
dimensions from rest of the sentence, from knowledge of 
defaults or perhaps from values in previous sentences. 
The most common Instance dimension is TIME and its value 
is readily obtained from the tense of the verb or from a 
clme phrase. If the instance dimensions indicate an 
existing instance then the partial provisional instance 
from the sentence is incorporated into the existing real 
instance, otherwise a new instance is created. 
2.3  FINDING THE MEANING OF A SENTENCE 
Severa l  mapp ings  can  be  made f rom the  representat ion  o f  
s t ructured  ob jec ts  to  syntactic c lasses .  For  example,  
all nodes  wi l l  be re fer red  to  by nouns  and noun phrases ,  
l inks  w i l l  be  re fer red  to  by  prepos i t ions  and  verbs  and  
members o f  a VALSET or  a 0VALSET w i l l  ba  re fer red  to  by  
ad jec t ives .  The l inks  between concepts  and cha  ~rds  
that  can  be  used  to  re fer  to  them are made at  sys tem 
bu i ld  t ime when che s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  const ructed .  
Some words  such  as "both"  and "very"  re fer  to  procedures  
whose act ions  are  the  same no mat ter  what  the  s t ructured  
ob jec t .  
The nature of structured objects and of the sentences in 
cases Indicate thac a "case'* \[Bruce 1975\] approach to 
semantic analysis is a "natural". A case syecsm ham in 
fact been implemented with such cases as ATTRIBUTE, 
OBJECT, VALUE, and UNIT. One case that is particularly 
useful is FOCUS. I t  is used to  record  re ferences  Co left 
eye or  r ight  eye  fo r  use  in  embedded or  con jo ined  
sentences such as (13). 
The pressure  in  the  l e f t  eye  i s  27 
and there is an arcuate scocoma. (13) 
For the reasons discussed in section 2.2 ic is necessary 
co assign sacs of candidate referents to  soma of the  case 
values during the course of the parse. These sacs are 
pruned as higher levels of the parse tree are built. 
3. SYNTAX 
It is noc really possible to  vlew cha  sentences 
comprising a case as a subset of English since many of 
the elementary grammatical rules are broken (e.g. 
frequent omission of verbs). Rather the sentences are in 
a medical dialect and parr of the task of wrlClng an 
interpreter for cases involves an anthropological 
investlgaclon of the dialect and its definit ion in some 
formal way. An analysls of a nt~"ber of cases revealed 
the following characteristics (see also \[Sangscer 1978\]): 
I) Frequent omission of verbs and punctuation. 
2) ~ch use  o f  abbrev ia t ions  loca l  to  the  
domain .  
3) Two kinds of ellipsis are evident. In one 
kind the constituents left ouC are co be recovered 
f rom knowledge of  the  s t ructured  ob jec t ;  the  ocher  
k ind  i s  the  s tandard  k ind  o f  textua l  e l l ips i s  where  
the  miss ing  macer i s l  i s  recovered  f rom prev ious  
sentences .  
4) Two d i f fe rent  uses of ad ject iva l  and  
prepos i t iona l  qualifiers can be d is t ingu ished .  
There is a referenclal use as in "in Left eye" in 
(14) and also an attributive use as in "of elevated 
pressure"  in (14)  
There  i s  a h i s tory  o f  e levated  
pressure in the left eye .  (14)  
An adjective can only have a referential use if iC 
has previously been used attrlbucively or if i t  
refers to a focussing attribute. 
5) Sentences containing several assertions 
tend to tak~a one of two forms. In one of these cha 
focus is on an  eye and several measurements are 
given for that eye as in (15). 
In  the  le f t  eye  chars  i s  a pressure  
o f  27, .5  cupp ing  and an  ercuaCe 
ecotome.  (:5) 
In the  o ther  fo rm the  focus  i s  on  an  a t t r ibute  and

(ha qualifying phrases "in the left / rlghc/boch

sentences and conslderabla work must  be done to 
find the correct scope.
