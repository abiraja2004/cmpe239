Abstract
In order to achieve the long-range goal
of semantic interpretation of noun com-
pounds, it is often necessary to first de-
termine their syntactic structure. This pa-
per describes an unsupervised method for
noun compound bracketing which extracts
statistics from Web search engines using a
?2 measure, a new set of surface features,
and paraphrases. On a gold standard, the
system achieves results of 89.34% (base-
line 66.80%), which is a sizable improve-
ment over the state of the art (80.70%).
1 Introduction
An important but understudied language analy-
sis problem is that of noun compound bracketing,
which is generally viewed as a necessary step to-
wards noun compound interpretation. Consider the
following contrastive pair of noun compounds:
(1) liver cell antibody
(2) liver cell line
In example (1) an antibody targets a liver cell, while
(2) refers to a cell line which is derived from the
liver. In order to make these semantic distinctions
accurately, it can be useful to begin with the cor-
rect grouping of terms, since choosing a particular
syntactic structure limits the options left for seman-
tics. Although equivalent at the part of speech (POS)
level, these two noun compounds have different syn-
tactic trees. The distinction can be represented as a
binary tree or, equivalently, as a binary bracketing:
(1b) [ [ liver cell ] antibody ] (left bracketing)
(2b) [ liver [cell line] ] (right bracketing)
In this paper, we describe a highly accurate un-
supervised method for making bracketing decisions
for noun compounds (NCs). We improve on the cur-
rent standard approach of using bigram estimates to
compute adjacency and dependency scores by intro-
ducing the use of the ?2 measure for this problem.
We also introduce a new set of surface features for
querying Web search engines which prove highly ef-
fective. Finally, we experiment with paraphrases for
improving prediction statistics. We have evaluated
the application of combinations of these features to
predict NC bracketing on two distinct collections,
one consisting of terms drawn from encyclopedia
text, and another drawn from bioscience text.
The remainder of this paper describes related
work, the word association models, the surface fea-
tures, the paraphrase features and the results.
2 Related Work
The syntax and semantics of NCs is an active area of
research; the Journal of Computer Speech and Lan-
guage has an upcoming special issue on Multiword
Expressions.
The best known early work on automated un-
supervised NC bracketing is that of Lauer (1995)
who introduces the probabilistic dependency model
for the syntactic disambiguation of NCs and argues
against the adjacency model, proposed by Marcus
(1980), Pustejovsky et al (1993) and Resnik (1993).
Lauer collects n-gram statistics from Grolier?s en-
cyclopedia, containing about 8 million words. To
17
overcome data sparsity problems, he estimates prob-
abilities over conceptual categories in a taxonomy
(Roget?s thesaurus) rather than for individual words.
Lauer evaluated his models on a set of 244 unam-
biguous NCs derived from the same encyclopedia
(inter-annotator agreement 81.50%) and achieved
77.50% for the dependency model above (baseline
66.80%). Adding POS and further tuning allowed
him to achieve the state-of-the-art result of 80.70%.
More recently, Keller and Lapata (2003) evalu-
ate the utility of using Web search engines for ob-
taining frequencies for unseen bigrams. They then
later propose using Web counts as a baseline unsu-
pervised method for many NLP tasks (Lapata and
Keller, 2004). They apply this idea to six NLP tasks,
including the syntactic and semantic disambigua-
tion of NCs following Lauer (1995), and show that
variations on bigram counts perform nearly as well
as more elaborate methods. They do not use tax-
onomies and work with the word n-grams directly,
achieving 78.68% with a much simpler version of
the dependency model.
Girju et al (2005) propose a supervised model
(decision tree) for NC bracketing in context, based
on five semantic features (requiring the correct
WordNet sense to be given): the top three Word-
Net semantic classes for each noun, derivationally
related forms and whether the noun is a nominaliza-
tion. The algorithm achieves accuracy of 83.10%.
3 Models and Features
3.1 Adjacency and Dependency Models
In related work, a distinction is often made between
what is called the dependency model and the adja-
cency model. The main idea is as follows. For a
given 3-word NC w1w2w3, there are two reasons it
may take on right bracketing, [w1[w2w3]]. Either (a)
w2w3 is a compound (modified byw1), or (b)w1 and
w2 independently modify w3. This distinction can
be seen in the examples home health care (health
care is a compound modified by home) versus adult
male rat (adult and male independently modify rat).
The adjacency model checks (a), whether w2w3
is a compound (i.e., how strongly w2 modifies w3
as opposed to w1w2 being a compound) to decide
whether or not to predict a right bracketing. The
dependency model checks (b), does w1 modify w3
(as opposed to w1 modifying w2).
Left bracketing is a bit different since there is only
modificational choice for a 3-word NC. If w1 modi-
fies w2, this implies that w1w2 is a compound which
in turn modifies w3, as in law enforcement agent.
Thus the usefulness of the adjacency model vs.
the dependency model can depend in part on the mix
of left and right bracketing. Below we show that the
dependency model works better than the adjaceny
model, confirming other results in the literature. The
next subsections describe several different ways to
compute these measures.
3.2 Using Frequencies
The most straightforward way to compute adjacency
and dependency scores is to simply count the cor-
responding frequencies. Lapata and Keller (2004)
achieved their best accuracy (78.68%) with the de-
pendency model and the simple symmetric score
#(wi, wj).1
3.3 Computing Probabilities
Lauer (1995) assumes that adjacency and depen-
dency should be computed via probabilities. Since
they are relatively simple to compute, we investigate
them in our experiments.
Consider the dependency model, as introduced
above, and the NC w1w2w3. Let Pr(wi ? wj |wj)
be the probability that the word wi precedes a
given fixed word wj . Assuming that the distinct
head-modifier relations are independent, we obtain
Pr(right) = Pr(w1 ? w3|w3)Pr(w2 ? w3|w3)
and Pr(left) = Pr(w1 ? w2|w2)Pr(w2 ? w3|w3).
To choose the more likely structure, we can drop
the shared factor and compare Pr(w1 ? w3|w3) to
Pr(w1 ? w2|w2).
The alternative adjacency model compares
Pr(w2 ? w3|w3) to Pr(w1 ? w2|w2), i.e. the
association strength between the last two words vs.
that between the first two. If the first probability is
larger than the second, the model predicts right.
The probability Pr(w1 ? w2|w2) can be esti-
mated as #(w1, w2)/#(w2), where #(w1, w2) and
#(w2) are the corresponding bigram and unigram
1This score worked best on training, when Keller&Lapata
were doing model selection. On testing, Pr (with the depen-
dency model) worked better and achieved accuracy of 80.32%,
but this result was ignored, as Pr did worse on training.
18
frequencies. They can be approximated as the num-
ber of pages returned by a search engine in response
to queries for the exact phrase ?w1 w2? and for the
word w2. In our experiments below we smoothed2
each of these frequencies by adding 0.5 to avoid
problems caused by nonexistent n-grams.
Unless some particular probabilistic interpreta-
tion is needed,3 there is no reason why for a given
ordered pair of words (wi, wj), we should use
Pr(wi ? wj |wj) rather than Pr(wj ? wi|wi),
i < j. This is confirmed by the adjacency model
experiments in (Lapata and Keller, 2004) on Lauer?s
NC set. Their results show that both ways of
computing the probabilities make sense: using Al-
tavista queries, the former achieves a higher accu-
racy (70.49% vs. 68.85%), but the latter is better on
the British National Corpus (65.57% vs. 63.11%).
3.4 Other Measures of Association
In both models, the probability Pr(wi ? wj |wj)
can be replaced by some (possibly symmetric) mea-
sure of association between wi and wj , such as Chi
squared (?2). To calculate ?2(wi, wj), we need:
(A) #(wi, wj);
(B) #(wi, wj), the number of bigrams in which the
first word is wi, followed by a word other than
wj ;
(C) #(wi, wj), the number of bigrams, ending in
wj , whose first word is other than wi;
(D) #(wi, wj), the number of bigrams in which the
first word is not wi and the second is not wj .
They are combined in the following formula:
?2 =
N(AD ?BC)2
(A+ C)(B +D)(A+B)(C +D)
(1)
Here N = A + B + C + D is the total num-
ber of bigrams, B = #(wi) ? #(wi, wj) and C =
#(wj) ?#(wi, wj). While it is hard to estimate D
2Zero counts sometimes happen for #(w1, w3), but are rare
for unigrams and bigrams on the Web, and there is no need for
a more sophisticated smoothing.
3For example, as used by Lauer to introduce a prior for left-
right bracketing preference. The best Lauer model does not
work with words directly, but uses a taxonomy and further needs
a probabilistic interpretation so that the hidden taxonomy vari-
ables can be summed out. Because of that summation, the term
Pr(w2 ? w3|w3) does not cancel in his dependency model.
directly, we can calculate it asD = N?A?B?C.
Finally, we estimate N as the total number of in-
dexed bigrams on the Web. They are estimated as 8
trillion, since Google indexes about 8 billion pages
and each contains about 1,000 words on average.
Other measures of word association are possible,
such as mutual information (MI), which we can use
with the dependency and the adjacency models, sim-
ilarly to #, ?2 or Pr. However, in our experiments,
?2 worked better than other methods; this is not sur-
prising, as ?2 is known to outperform MI as a mea-
sure of association (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).
3.5 Web-Derived Surface Features
Authors sometimes (consciously or not) disam-
biguate the words they write by using surface-level
markers to suggest the correct meaning. We have
found that exploiting these markers, when they oc-
cur, can prove to be very helpful for making brack-
eting predictions. The enormous size of Web search
engine indexes facilitates finding such markers fre-
quently enough to make them useful.
One very productive feature is the dash (hyphen).
Starting with the term cell cycle analysis, if we can
find a version of it in which a dash occurs between
the first two words: cell-cycle, this suggests a left
bracketing for the full NC. Similarly, the dash in
donor T-cell favors a right bracketing. The right-
hand dashes are less reliable though, as their scope
is ambiguous. In fiber optics-system, the hyphen in-
dicates that the noun compound fiber optics modifies
system. There are also cases with multiple hyphens,
as in t-cell-depletion, which preclude their use.
The genitive ending, or possessive marker is an-
other useful indicator. The phrase brain?s stem
cells suggests a right bracketing for brain stem cells,
while brain stem?s cells favors a left bracketing.4
Another highly reliable source is related to inter-
nal capitalization. For example Plasmodium vivax
Malaria suggests left bracketing, while brain Stem
cells would favor a right one. (We disable this fea-
ture on Roman digits and single-letter words to pre-
vent problems with terms like vitamin D deficiency,
where the capitalization is just a convention as op-
posed to a special mark to make the reader think that
the last two terms should go together.)
4Features can also occur combined, e.g. brain?s stem-cells.
19
We can also make use of embedded slashes. For
example in leukemia/lymphoma cell, the slash pre-
dicts a right bracketing since the first word is an al-
ternative and cannot be a modifier of the second one.
In some cases we can find instances of the NC
in which one or more words are enclosed in paren-
theses, e.g., growth factor (beta) or (growth fac-
tor) beta, both of which indicate a left structure, or
(brain) stem cells, which suggests a right bracketing.
Even a comma, a dot or a colon (or any spe-
cial character) can act as indicators. For example,
?health care, provider? or ?lung cancer: patients?
are weak predictors of a left bracketing, showing
that the author chose to keep two of the words to-
gether, separating out the third one.
We can also exploit dashes to words external to
the target NC, as in mouse-brain stem cells, which
is a weak indicator of right bracketing.
Unfortunately, Web search engines ignore punc-
tuation characters, thus preventing querying directly
for terms containing hyphens, brackets, apostrophes,
etc. We collect them indirectly by issuing queries
with the NC as an exact phrase and then post-
processing the resulting summaries, looking for the
surface features of interest. Search engines typically
allow the user to explore up to 1000 results. We col-
lect all results and summary texts that are available
for the target NC and then search for the surface pat-
terns using regular expressions over the text. Each
match increases the score for left or right bracket-
ing, depending on which the pattern favors.
While some of the above features are clearly
more reliable than others, we do not try to weight
them. For a given NC, we post-process the returned
Web summaries, then we find the number of left-
predicting surface feature instances (regardless of
their type) and compare it to the number of right-
predicting ones to make a bracketing decision.5
3.6 Other Web-Derived Features
Some features can be obtained by using the over-
all counts returned by the search engine. As these
counts are derived from the entire Web, as opposed
to a set of up to 1,000 summaries, they are of differ-
ent magnitude, and we did not want to simply add
them to the surface features above. They appear as
5This appears as Surface features (sum) in Tables 1 and 2.
independent models in Tables 1 and 2.
First, in some cases, we can query for possessive
markers directly: although search engines drop the
apostrophe, they keep the s, so we can query for
?brain?s? (but not for ?brains? ?). We then com-
pare the number of times the possessive marker ap-
peared on the second vs. the first word, to make a
bracketing decision.
Abbreviations are another important feature. For
example, ?tumor necrosis factor (NF)? suggests a
right bracketing, while ?tumor necrosis (TN) fac-
tor? would favor left. We would like to issue exact
phrase queries for the two patterns and see which
one is more frequent. Unfortunately, the search en-
gines drop the brackets and ignore the capitalization,
so we issue queries with the parentheses removed, as
in ?tumor necrosis factor nf?. This produces highly
accurate results, although errors occur when the ab-
breviation is an existing word (e.g., me), a Roman
digit (e.g., IV), a state (e.g., CA), etc.
Another reliable feature is concatenation. Con-
sider the NC health care reform, which is left-
bracketed. Now, consider the bigram ?health care?.
At the time of writing, Google estimates 80,900,000
pages for it as an exact term. Now, if we try the
word healthcare we get 80,500,000 hits. At the
same time, carereform returns just 109. This sug-
gests that authors sometimes concatenate words that
act as compounds. We find below that comparing
the frequency of the concatenation of the left bigram
to that of the right (adjacency model for concatena-
tions) often yields accurate results. We also tried the
dependency model for concatenations, as well as the
concatenations of two words in the context of the
third one (i.e., compare frequencies of ?healthcare
reform? and ?health carereform?).
We also used Google?s support for ?*?, which al-
lows a single word wildcard, to see how often two of
the words are present but separated from the third by
some other word(s). This implicitly tries to capture
paraphrases involving the two sub-concepts making
up the whole. For example, we compared the fre-
quency of ?health care * reform? to that of ?health
* care reform?. We also used 2 and 3 stars and
switched the word group order (indicated with rev.
in Tables 1 and 2), e.g., ?care reform * * health?.
We also tried a simple reorder without inserting
stars, i.e., compare the frequency of ?reform health
20
care? to that of ?care reform health?. For exam-
ple, when analyzing myosin heavy chain we see that
heavy chain myosin is very frequent, which provides
evidence against grouping heavy and chain together
as they can commute.
Further, we tried to look inside the internal inflec-
tion variability. The idea is that if ?tyrosine kinase
activation? is left-bracketed, then the first two words
probably make a whole and thus the second word
can be found inflected elsewhere but the first word
cannot, e.g., ?tyrosine kinases activation?. Alterna-
tively, if we find different internal inflections of the
first word, this would favor a right bracketing.
Finally, we tried switching the word order of the
first two words. If they independently modify the
third one (which implies a right bracketing), then we
could expect to see also a form with the first two
words switched, e.g., if we are given ?adult male
rat?, we would also expect ?male adult rat?.
3.7 Paraphrases
Warren (1978) proposes that the semantics of the re-
lations between words in a noun compound are of-
ten made overt by paraphrase. As an example of
prepositional paraphrase, an author describing the
concept of brain stem cells may choose to write it
in a more expanded manner, such as stem cells in
the brain. This contrast can be helpful for syntactic
bracketing, suggesting that the full NC takes on right
bracketing, since stem and cells are kept together in
the expanded version. However, this NC is ambigu-
ous, and can also be paraphrased as cells from the
brain stem, implying a left bracketing.
Some NCs? meaning cannot be readily expressed
with a prepositional paraphrase (Warren, 1978). An
alternative is the copula paraphrase, as in office
building that/which is a skyscraper (right bracket-
ing), or a verbal paraphrase such as pain associated
with arthritis migraine (left).
Other researchers have used prepositional para-
phrases as a proxy for determining the semantic rela-
tions that hold between nouns in a compound (Lauer,
1995; Keller and Lapata, 2003; Girju et al, 2005).
Since most NCs have a prepositional paraphrase,
Lauer builds a model trying to choose between the
most likely candidate prepositions: of, for, in, at,
on, from, with and about (excluding like which is
mentioned by Warren). This could be problematic
though, since as a study by Downing (1977) shows,
when no context is provided, people often come up
with incompatible interpretations.
In contrast, we use paraphrases in order to make
syntactic bracketing assignments. Instead of trying
to manually decide the correct paraphrases, we can
issue queries using paraphrase patterns and find out
how often each occurs in the corpus. We then add
up the number of hits predicting a left versus a right
bracketing and compare the counts.
Unfortunately, search engines lack linguistic an-
notations, making general verbal paraphrases too ex-
pensive. Instead we used a small set of hand-chosen
paraphrases: associated with, caused by, contained
in, derived from, focusing on, found in, involved in,
located at/in, made of, performed by, preventing,
related to and used by/in/for. It is however feasi-
ble to generate queries predicting left/right brack-
eting with/without a determiner for every preposi-
tion.6 For the copula paraphrases we combine two
verb forms is and was, and three complementizers
that, which and who. These are optionally combined
with a preposition or a verb form, e.g. themes that
are used in science fiction.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Lauer?s Dataset
We experimented with the dataset from (Lauer,
1995), in order to produce results comparable to
those of Lauer and Keller & Lapata. The set consists
of 244 unambiguous 3-noun NCs extracted from
Grolier?s encyclopedia; however, only 216 of these
NCs are unique.
Lauer (1995) derived n-gram frequencies from
the Grolier?s corpus and tested the dependency and
the adjacency models using this text. To help combat
data sparseness issues he also incorporated a taxon-
omy and some additional information (see Related
Work section above). Lapata and Keller (2004) de-
rived their statistics from the Web and achieved re-
sults close to Lauer?s using simple lexical models.
4.2 Biomedical Dataset
We constructed a new set of noun compounds from
the biomedical literature. Using the Open NLP
6In addition to the articles (a, an, the), we also used quanti-
fiers (e.g. some, every) and pronouns (e.g. this, his).
21
tools,7 we sentence splitted, tokenized, POS tagged
and shallow parsed a set of 1.4 million MEDLINE
abstracts (citations between 1994 and 2003). Then
we extracted all 3-noun sequences falling in the last
three positions of noun phrases (NPs) found in the
shallow parse. If the NP contained other nouns, the
sequence was discarded. This allows for NCs which
are modified by adjectives, determiners, and so on,
but prevents extracting 3-noun NCs that are part of
longer NCs. For details, see (Nakov et al, 2005).
This procedure resulted in 418,678 different NC
types. We manually investigated the most frequent
ones, removing those that had errors in tokeniza-
tion (e.g., containing words like transplan or tation),
POS tagging (e.g., acute lung injury, where acute
was wrongly tagged as a noun) or shallow parsing
(e.g., situ hybridization, that misses in). We had to
consider the first 843 examples in order to obtain
500 good ones, which suggests an extraction accu-
racy of 59%. This number is low mainly because the
tokenizer handles dash-connected words as a single
token (e.g. factor-alpha) and many tokens contained
other special characters (e.g. cd4+), which cannot
be used in a query against a search engine and had
to be discarded.
The 500 NCs were annotated independently by
two judges, one of which has a biomedical back-
ground; the other one was one of the authors. The
problematic cases were reconsidered by the two
judges and after agreement was reached, the set con-
tained: 361 left bracketed, 69 right bracketed and
70 ambiguous NCs. The latter group was excluded
from the experiments.8
We calculated the inter-annotator agreement on
the 430 cases that were marked as unambiguous
after agreement. Using the original annotator?s
choices, we obtained an agreement of 88% or 82%,
depending on whether we consider the annotations,
that were initially marked as ambiguous by one of
the judges to be correct. The corresponding values
for the kappa statistics were .606 (substantial agree-
ment) and .442 (moderate agreement).

8Two NCs can appear more than once but with a different
inflection or with a different word variant, e.g,. colon cancer
cells and colon carcinoma cells.
4.3 Experiments
The n-grams, surface features, and paraphrase
counts were collected by issuing exact phrase
queries, limiting the pages to English and request-
ing filtering of similar results.9 For each NC, we
generated all possible word inflections (e.g., tumor
and tumors) and alternative word variants (e.g., tu-
mor and tumour). For the biomedical dataset they
were automatically obtained from the UMLS Spe-
cialist lexicon.10 For Lauer?s set we used Carroll?s
morphological tools.11 For bigrams, we inflect only
the second word. Similarly, for a prepositional para-
phrase we generate all possible inflected forms for
the two parts, before and after the preposition.
4.4 Results and Discussion
The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. As NCs
are left-bracketed at least 2/3rds of the time (Lauer,
1995), a straightforward baseline is to always as-
sign a left bracketing. Tables 1 and 2 suggest that
the surface features perform best. The paraphrases
are equally good on the biomedical dataset, but on
Lauer?s set their performance is lower and is compa-
rable to that of the dependency model.
The dependency model clearly outperforms the
adjacency one (as other researchers have found) on
Lauer?s set, but not on the biomedical set, where it
is equally good. ?2 barely outperforms #, but on the
biomedical set ?2 is a clear winner (by about 1.5%)
on both dependency and adjacency models.
The frequencies (#) outperform or at least rival the
probabilities on both sets and for both models. This
is not surprising, given the previous results by Lap-
ata and Keller (2004). Frequencies also outperform
Pr on the biomedical set. This may be due to the
abundance of single-letter words in that set (because
of terms like T cell, B cell, vitamin D etc.; similar
problems are caused by Roman digits like ii, iii etc.),
whose Web frequencies are rather unreliable, as they
are used by Pr but not by frequencies. Single-letter
words cause potential problems for the paraphrases
9In our experiments we used MSN Search statistics for the
n-grams and the paraphrases (unless the pattern contained a
?*?), and Google for the surface features. MSN always re-
turned exact numbers, while Google and Yahoo rounded their
page hits, which generally leads to lower accuracy (Yahoo was
better than Google for these estimates).

good at predicting left bracketing, but unreliable for
right-bracketed examples. This is probably in part
due to the fact that they look for adjacent words, i.e.,
they act as a kind of adjacency model.
We obtained our best overall results by combining
the most reliable models, marked in bold in Tables
1, 2 and 4. As they have independent errors, we used
a majority vote combination.
Table 3 compares our results to those of Lauer
(1995) and of Lapata and Keller (2004). It is impor-
tant to note though, that our results are directly com-
parable to those of Lauer, while the Keller&Lapata?s
are not, since they used half of the Lauer set for de-

velopment and the other half for testing.12 We, fol-
lowing Lauer, used everything for testing. Lapata &
Keller also used the AltaVista search engine, which
no longer exists in its earlier form. The table does
not contain the results of Girju et al (2005), who
achieved 83.10% accuracy, but used a supervised al-
gorithm and targeted bracketing in context. They
further ?shuffled? the Lauer?s set, mixing it with ad-
ditional data, thus making their results even harder
to compare to these in the table.
Note that using page hits as a proxy for n-gram
frequencies can produce some counter-intuitive re-
sults. Consider the bigrams w1w4, w2w4 and w3w4
and a page that contains each bigram exactly once.
A search engine will contribute a page count of 1 for
w4 instead of a frequency of 3; thus the page hits
for w4 can be smaller than the page hits for the sum
of the individual bigrams. See Keller and Lapata
(2003) for more issues.
12In fact, the differences are negligible; their system achieves
pretty much the same result on the half split as well as on the
whole set (personal communication).

5 Conclusions and Future Work
We have extended and improved upon the state-of-
the-art approaches to NC bracketing using an un-
supervised method that is more robust than Lauer
(1995) and more accurate than Lapata and Keller
(2004). Future work will include testing on NCs
consisting of more than 3 nouns, recognizing the
ambiguous cases, and bracketing NPs that include
determiners and modifiers. We plan to test this ap-
proach on other important NLP problems.
As mentioned above, NC bracketing should be
helpful for semantic interpretation. Another possi-
ble application is the refinement of parser output.
Currently, NPs in the Penn TreeBank are flat, with-
out internal structure. Absent any other information,
probabilistic parsers typically assume right bracket-
ing, which is incorrect about 2/3rds of the time for
3-noun NCs. It may be useful to augment the Penn
TreeBank with dependencies inside the currently flat
NPs, which may improve their performance overall.
