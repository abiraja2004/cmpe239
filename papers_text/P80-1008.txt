This panel was asked to cons ider  how var ious  "prob lem 
contexts"  (e .g . ,  cooperat ive ly  assembling a pump, or  
Socrat i ca l ly  teaching law) in f luence  the use o f  language. 
As a s tar t ing  po in t ,  I sha l l  regard the problem context  
as es tab l i sh ing  a set  o f  expectat ions  and assumptions 
about the shared be l ie fs ,  goa ls ,  and soc ia l  ro les  o f  
those par t i c ipants .  Just  how people negot ia te  that  they 
are in a g iven problem context  and what they know about 
those contexts  are in teres t ing  quest ions ,  but  not  ones I 
sha l l  address here.  Rather,  I sha l l  out l ine  a theory  o f  
language use that  is sens i t ive  ?o those be l ie fs ,  goa ls ,  
and expectat ions .  
The theory is being app l ied  to character i ze  actua l  
d ia logues occur r ing  in the Fami l ia r  task -or lented  s l t -  
uat ion  ~O.1, in which an exper t  ins t ructs  a novice Co do 
something, in our case to assemble a toy water  pump. In 
such c i rcumstances,  the d ia logue  par t i c ipants  can be 
viewed as per forming speech acts  p lanned,  p r lmar l \ ]y ,  to 
achieve goals set  by the task.  Other contexts  undoubted- 
ly emphasize the ins t rumenta l  uses o f  language (e .g . ,~)  
but  those problem contexts  w i l l  not  be cons idered here.  
The app l i ca t ion  o f  a model o f  speech act  use to actua l  
d ia logue st resses  the need For sources of  ev idence to 
substant ia te  pred ic t ions .  The purpose of  th i s  paper is 
to po in t  to one such source - -  speaker - re ference  ~9\] -  
The natura l  cand idate  fo r  a theory  o f  ins t rumenta l  use 
o f  speech acts is an account o f  ra t iona l  ac t ion  ~ - -  
what is typ ica l ly  termed "p lann ing" .  However, cont rary  
to the assumption of  most p lann ing systems, we are in -  
te res ted  in the p lann ing  o f  (usua l ly )  cooperat ive  agents 
who at tempt  to recognize and fac i l i ta te  the plans o f  
the i r  par tners  ~,h ,5 , \ ]6 ,20 \ ] .  Such he lp fu l  behav ior  is 
independent of  the use of  language, but  is the source o f  
much conversational coherence. 
A plan based theory  o f  speech acts spec i f ies  that  plan 
recogn i t ion  is the basis  fo r  in fe r r ing  the i l l ocuC ionary  
fo rce(s )  o f  an ut terance .  The goal o f  such a theory  is 
to fo rmal i ze  the set  o f  poss ib le  plans under ly ing  the use 
of  par t i cu la r  speech acts  Co achieve a g iven  set  o f  goa ls .  
In l ight  o f  the independent mot ivat ion  fo r  p lan generat ion  
and recogn i t ion ,  such a Formalism should t reat  commun- 
i ca t ive  and non-communlcat lve acts un i fo rmly ,  by s ta t ing  
the communicative nature  o f  an i l l ocut lonary  act  as par t  
o f  chat ac t ' s  de f in i t ion .  A reasoning system, be i t  
human or  computer,  would then not  have to employ spec ia l  
knowledge about communicative ac ts ;  i t  would s imply  a t -  
tempt Co achieve or  recognize goa ls .  
The components o f  speech act  p \ ]ann lng and recogn i t ion  
systems developed so fa r  inc lude:  a Formal language fo r  
descr ib ing  mental s ta tes  and s ta tes  o f  the phys ica l  and 
soc ia l  wor lds ,  operators  fo r  descr ib ing  changes o f  s ta te ,  
assoc ia t ions  o f  u t te rance  features  (e .g . ,  mood) w i th  cer -  
ta ln  operators ,  and a set  of  p lan const ruct ion  and re-  
cogn i t ion  in ferences .  I l l ocut ionar 'y  acts are def ined  as 
operators  that  p r imar i ly  a f fec t  the mental s ta tes  o f  
speakers and hearers L3 ,8 ,13 , I7 J .  
To be more spec i f i c ,  in the most fu l l y  developed at -  
tempt at  such a theory ,  Per rau lc  and A l len  ~ show how 
plan recogn i t ion  can "reason out"  a c lass o f  ind i rec t  
speech acts .  Br ie f ly ,  they def ine  "sur face  =' speech act  
operators ,  which depend on an ut terance 's  mood, and op- 
e ra tors  For i l l ocut ionary  acts such as request ing .  Plan 
recogn i t ion  invo lves  in ferences o f  the form " the  agent 
intended to perform act ion  X because he intended to ach- 
ieve i t s  e f fec t  in o rder  to enable him to do some other  
ac t ion  Y". Such in ferences  are app l ied  to sur face speech 
act  operators  (character i z ing ,  fo r  ins tance ,  " I s  the sa l t  
near you?")  to y ie ld  i i l ocut ionary  operators  such as

requests to pass the salt. 
The remainder of this paper attempts to i l lustrate the 
kinds of predictlons made by the theory,.and the use of 
anaphora to support one such prediction." Consider the 
following dialogue fragment (transmitted over teletype) 
in the water pump context described earl ier:  
Expert: l ) .  '~e need a clear bent tube For the bottom 
hole." 
Novice: 2). "OK, i t ' s  done." 
Expert: 3). "OK, now, start pumping" 
The example is constructed to i l lustrate my point, but i t  
does not "feel" a r t i f i c ia l .  Experiments we are conducting 
show analogous phenomena in telephone and teletype modes. 
The theory predicts two inference paths For utterance 
I -- "helpful" and "intended". In the Former case, the 
novice observes the surface-lnform speech act indicated 
by a declarative utterance, and interprets i t  simply as 
an inform act that communicates a jo int  need. Then, be- 
cause the novice is helpful, she continues to recognize 
the plan behind the expert's utterance and attempts to 
further i t  by performing the action of putting the spout 
over the hole. The novice, therefore, is acting on her 
own, evaluating the reasonableness of the plan inferred 
for the expert using private beliefs about the expert's 
beliefs and intentions. Alternatively, she could infer 
that the expert intended for i t  to be mutually believed 
that he intended her to put on the tube. Thus, the novice 
would be acting because she thinks the expert intended 
for her ?o do so. Later, she could summarize the expert's 
utterance and intentions as a request ~7\]. Perrault and 
Alien supply heuristics that would predlct-~" the preferred 
inference route to be the "intended" path since i t  is 
mutually believed that putting the tube on is the relev- 
ant act ,  and h is  in tend ing  that  she per form pump-re lated 
acts is an expected goal in th i s  problem context .  To use 
Per rau l t  and A l ien 's  model For ana lyz ing  conversat ion ,  
such pred ic t ions  must be va l idated  aga ins t  ev idence o f  
the nov ice 's  in terpretat ion  o f  the exper t ' s  in tent .  
Signalling Interpretation of Intent 
For th i s  problem context  and communication moda l i ty ,  
the novice and exper t  shared knowledge that  the exoer t  
w i l l  a t tempt  to get the nov ice  to achieve each subgoal 
o f  the phys ica l  task ,  and the nov ice  must ind icate  suc- 
cess fu l  complet ion o f  those subtasks .  However, not a l l  
communicative acts ach iev ing  the goal o f  ind icat ing  suc- 
cess fu l  complet ion prov ide  ev idence o f  the nov ice 's  in -  
te rpretat ion  o f  in tent .  For ins tance ,  the novlce might 
say " I ' ve  put the bent tube on" s imply  to keep the exper t  
informed o f  the s i tuat lon .  Such an in format ive  act  could 
ar i se  i f  the problem context  and pr io r  conversat ion  d ld  
not make the sa l ience  o f  put t ing  the tube on mutua l ly  
known. To supply ev idence o f  the nov ice 's  in terpretat ion  
of intent, her response must pragmatically presuppose 
that interpretation. 
In our example, the novice has used " i t "  to refer to 
the action she has performed. I t  has been proposed that 
definite and pronomlnal/pro-verbal reference requires 
mutual belief chat the object in question_ --is in Focus 
O0,,s\] and satisfies the "descr ip t ,on ' l  t6,l  . Assuming 
that the,_inferring of mutually believed goals places them 
in focusU~ , the shared knowledge needed to refer using 
" i t "  is supplied by only one of the above interpretations 
-- the one summarizable as an indirect request. 
Robinson ~!~ has identified this problem of reference 
to ac t ions  and has implemented a system to reso lve  them. 
In chls paper,  I s t ress  the importance o f  that  work to 
theor ies  o f  speech act  use.

Other s ignals o f  the in terpretat ion  of  intent  need to 
be ident i f ied  to expla in how the exper t i s  "OK, now s tar t  
pumping" communicates that he thinks she has in ter -  
preted him cor rect ly  - -  mutual s igna l l ing  of  intent 
and i ts  in terpretat ion  is central  to conversat ional  
Success. 
A formal theory that could capture the be l ie f ,  in-  
tent ion,  and focus condit ions fo r  speaker-reference is 
thus c lear ly  needed to va l idate  models of  speech act use. 
A plan-based theory might accomodate such an analys is  via 
a decomposition of  cur rent ly  p r imi t ive  surface speech 
acts to include reference acts \[2,18J.  By planning re f -  
erence acts to fac i l i ta te  the hearers'  plans (of .  ~43), 
a system could perhaps also answer questions coopera- 
t i ve ly  without resort ing to Gricean maxims or "room 
theor ies"  \[19.~. 
I have given a bare bones out l ine  of  how a descr ip-  
t ion of  speaker-reference can ser~e as a source of em- 
p i r i ca l  support to a theory of  speech acts. However, 
much more research must take place to f lesh out the 
theoret ica l  connections. I have also de l iberate ly  av- 
oided problems o f  computation here, but hope the panel 
w i l l  discuss these issues, espec ia l l y  the u t i l i ty  o f  
computational mode is to ethnographers of  conversat ion.
