Abstract 
The paper describes an approach to auto-
matically select from Indian Language the 
appropriate lexical correspondence of Eng-
lish simple preposition. The paper de-
scribes this task from a Machine Transla-
tion (MT) perspective. We use the proper-
ties of the head and complement of the 
preposition to select the appropriate sense 
in the target language. We later show that 
the results obtained from this approach are 
promising. 
1 Introduction 
The task of identifying the appropriate sense from 
some target language (here, Hindi and Telugu) for 
a given simple preposition in some source lan-
guage (here, English) is rather complex for an MT 
system, and noting that most foreign language 
learners are never able to get a firm hold on prepo-
sitions of a new language (Brala, 2000), this should 
not be surprising. A simple example illustrates the 
problem: 
 
(1a) He bought a shirt with tiny collars. 
       ?with? gets translated to vaalii in Hindi (hnd). 
        and as kaligi unna in Telugu (tlg). 
 (1b) He washed a shirt with soap. 
       ?with? gets translated to se in hnd. 
    and as to (suffixed to head noun) in tlg. 
 
   For the above English sentences, if we try to 
swap the senses of ?with? in their corresponding 
target translation, the resulting sentences either 
become ill-formed or unfaithful to their English 
source. The pervasive use of preposition (or its 
equivalent in a given language) in most of the lan-
guages makes it a crucial element during transla-
tion. Inappropriate sense selection of a preposition 
during machine translation can have a negative 
impact on the quality of the translation, sometimes 
changing the semantics of the sentence drastically,  
thereby making the preposition sense selection 
module a critical component of any reliable MT 
system. 
  Finding the proper attachment site for the prepo-
sition in English, i.e. getting the correct parse for 
the prepositional phrase (PP) is a classic problem 
in MT, and this information can be used to identify 
the sense of a preposition. Figure 1 and Figure 2 
below show the correct attachment site of PPs in 
example (1a) and (1b) respectively. 
 
 
 
51
   The correct parse of the PP helps us in selecting 
the appropriate sense. However, finding the appro-
priate attachment only reduces the problem. It does 
not lead to a ?complete solution?. The following 
examples (2a, 2b and 3a, 3b) have the same at-
tachment site but take different senses in the target 
language: 
 
(2a) He has had fever for two days now. 
       ?for? gets translated as se in hnd. 
    and as nundi in tlg. 
(2b) He had fever for two days. 
       ?for? gets translated as taka in hnd. 
    Not translated in tlg.  
 
(3a) He is going to Delhi. 
?to? gets translated as ko, or preferably left un-
translated in hnd. 
and in tlg as ki (suffixed to the head noun), or 
may be left un-translated. 
(3b) He is going to his mother. 
       ?to? gets translated as ke paasa in hnd. 
   and daggaraku in tlg 
 
After looking at cases such as (2a), (2b) and (3a), 
(3b) where the parse is same i.e., preposition ?for 
and ?to? get attached to the main verb ?have? and 
?go? respectively, it is clear that we need to come 
up with some criterion which can help us in 
achieving our task. 
There has been extensive work on understanding 
prepositions linguistically, often from various an-
gles. Syntactically (Jackendoff, 1977; Emonds, 
1985; Rauh, 1993; Pullum and Huddleton, 2002), 
from a Cognitive perspective (Lakoff and Johnson, 
1980; Langacker, 1987; Brala, 2000), Semantically 
by (Saint-Dizier and Vazquez, 2001; Saint-Dizier, 
2005), and the Pragmatic aspects by (Fauconnier, 
1994). 
   The work of automatically selecting the correct 
sense has also received good amount of attention 
and there have been many attempts to solve the 
problem. (Japkowicz et. al, 1991) attempts to trans-
late locative prepositions between English and 
French. The paper introduces the notion of ?repre-
sentation of conceptualization? based in turn on 
(Grimaud, 1988). The paper synthesizes this idea 
with the thesis of ideal meaning (Herskovits, 1986). 
(Tezuka et. al, 2001) have tried to resolve concep-
tual geographical prepositions using inference rule 
based on cognitive maps which people have of the 
external world. (Hartrumpf et al, 2005) use 
knowledge representation formalism for PP inter-
pretation. 
Some studies pertain to systems which have 
been implemented for MT; (Gustavii, 2005) uses 
aligned parallel corpora to induce automatic rules 
by applying transformation-based learning. (Alam, 
2004) make use of contextual information to de-
termine the meanings of over. (Trujillo, 1992) use 
a transfer rule based approach to translate locative 
PP-phrase, the approach uses the dependency rela-
tions marked as indices with individual word and a 
bilingual lexicon which has mapping between 
source and target lexical item (with indices). 
(Naskar and Bandyopadhyay, 2005) look at the 
semantics of the head noun of the reference object 
(this is their main criterion) to get the lexical 
meaning of prepositions in an English-Bengali MT 
system. 
The current paper presents a study of preposi-
tions at, for, in, on, to and with in context of Eng-
lish to Indian language MT system. The paper is 
arranged as follows; Section 2 describes our ap-
proach to solving the mentioned task, the 3rd sec-
tion shows the performance of our approach along 
with the error analysis during the testing phase, we 
conclude the paper along with some future direc-
tion in section 4. 
2 Our Approach 
All the previous attempts can be broadly classified 
into 3 main categories; one, where the preposition 
is the main focus, concentration is on the semantics 
(cognitive or lexical) of the preposition; second, 
focus on the verb and the PP which the verb takes 
as argument; and lastly, the head noun of the PP 
becomes the deciding factor to get the appropriate 
sense. 
Very few approaches, like (Alam, 2004; Saint-
Dizier and Vazquez, 2001),  consider both, the 
head (modified) and the complement (modifier) 
information, to decide the sense of the preposition. 
The modified (or head) is the head of the phrase to 
which the PP attaches. The modifier (or 
complement) is the head noun of the PP. The 
following examples show very clearly why given a 
preposition we cannot depend only on the modified 
or the modifier separately, and that we must 
consider them both to solve the problem. 
 
52
Considering only the modifier (the complement); 
 
 (4a) He apologized to his mother. 
        ?to? gets translated as se in hnd 
        & ki (suffixed to the head noun) in  tlg 
 (4b) He went to his mother. 
         ?to? gets translated as ke paasa in hnd 
         & as daggaraku in tlg 
 
Considering only the modified (the head); 
 
 (5a) He waits for her at night. 
        ?at? gets translated as meM in hnd 
        & not translated in tlg 
 (5b) He waits for her at the station. 
         ?at? gets translated as par 
         & as lo in tlg 
 
Only considering the modifer ?his mother? in 4a 
and 4b is not sufficient, likewise taking only the 
modified ?waits? in 5a and 5b will be insufficient, 
both the pairs take different senses and have the 
same partial contextual enviornment which is 
misleading. Hence, the combined context of 
complement-head forms a better candidate for 
solving the problem. We come across plenty of 
cases where isolated information of 
modifier/modified can be misleading. 
The task of preposition sense selection can be 
divided into; 
(a) Getting the correct parse (the task of PP at-
tachment, identification of phrasal verb, etc.), 
(b) Context and semantic extraction, 
(c) Sense selection. 
 
This paper describes the algorithm for achieving 
the above mentioned steps. We assume the input to 
our module has the correct parse, i.e. Step (a) 
above is assumed here. The proposed algorithm is 
a component in English to Indian language MT 
system1, therefore, the required input can be pre-
sumed to be available. Steps (b, c) above are rule 
based, which make use of the modifier-modified 
relation, these relations and the properties of modi-
fier/modified form the core of the context in step 
(b). We then apply a series of rules, which specify 
the context and semantics in which a sense  
 
         1 (http://shakti.iiit.ac.in). Note here that the proposed 
algorithm has been tested with Shakti version 0.83x which has 
still not been released. The released version is 0.73. 
is expected to occur. 
2.1 Context and semantic extraction 
Extraction of context and semantic information (of 
modifier/modified) is done automatically by vari-
ous sub-modules which are combined together to 
perform the overall task. We use the word ?con-
text? very loosely. A context for us is a combina-
tion of various properties which can be syntactic or 
lexical, or both; syntactic context can be modifier-
modified relation, lexical properties can be mor-
phological information such as TAM (tense, aspect 
and modality) of a verb, class of the verb (Levin, 
1993), category of the lexical item and in some 
cases the lexical item itself.  
The semantics of the modifier and the modified 
are captured using WordNet (Miller, 1990), and 
certain other resources such as person, place dic-
tionaries, place and time filters (these filters make 
use of syntactic cues to mark basic time and place), 
etc. We use WordNet to get the hypernyms of a 
word. By using this property we can easily get the 
broader, more general class/concept for a modi-
fier/modified. Although effective and very intui-
tive, this method has its own problems. We will 
elaborate these problems in section 3.2. WordNet 
is also used to identify person and place names by 
using the hyponym tree for person and place. 
Along with the WordNet, as mentioned above, 
we use certain other filters such as place and time. 
They are used prior to using WordNet. In case a 
rule requires the modifier to be a place (rules are 
explained in 2.2), this information is acquired from 
the place filter. If the filter?s result is negative we 
use WordNet. Dictionaries and POS tags are 
checked for identifying proper names, we use a 
proper name dictionary as POS taggers tend to 
have a fixed upper limit especially when it comes 
to the identification of named entities. In essence, 
the linguistic resources are used in the following 
order; 
(1) Dictionaries, 
(2) Time & Place filter, 
(3) WordNet. 
 
Preliminary results have shown that certain 
prepositions occurring in the PP complement of 
certain verb classes (Levin, 1993) translate to a 
specific sense in Hindi. For example, preposition 
?at? in the case of peer verbs always translates to 
kii tarapha or kii ora in Hindi. This knowledge can 
53
be very informational and we plan to pursue this 
aspect in the future. 
2.2 Sense Selection 
We have noticed in the previous examples that the 
prepositions from English either get translated as 
suffixes to the head noun of the PP (in Telugu) or 
as postpositions (in Hindi and Telugu). An 
example where a preposition in English gets 
translated as postposition in its Telugu translation 
is shown below; 
 
(6) The book is on the table.  
  ?buka     taibila     paiina   undi? 
   ?Book?  ?table?     ?on?     ?there? 
 
We select the correct sense of the preposition 
based on a series of rules which are applied 
linearly. These rules have been manually 
constructed. We have tried to make the rules 
mutually exclusive, so that there are no clashes. 
Also, by making sure that the rules are mutually 
exclusive we don?t need to worry about the order 
in which the rules are listed out in the rule file, thus 
making the rule file less fragile. These rules 
currently cover around 20 high frequency English 
prepositions, these prepositions vary in their 
degree of ambiguity; some are highly ambiguous 
(e.g. to, by, with, etc.), whereas some are less 
ambiguous (e.g. against, around, as, etc.), hence 
these are easier to handle. 
Various senses on the target side for a given 
English preposition are selected on the basis of 
rules listed out in a file. The rule file comprises of 
tuples, each having 6 attributes.  
 
The attributes are listed below; 
 
a)  Source Language preposition 
b)  Modified category 
c)  Constraints on the modified item 
d)  Modifier category 
e)  Constraints on the modifier item 
f) Dictionary sense id of the source language 
preposition 
 
 
An example of a tuple: 
# at, v, -, n, place_close, at%p%5 
 
 
(7) He has opened a school at his home. 
 ?usane   apne ghara   mem eka  skuula kholaa hei? 
?He erg? ?his? ?house? ?at? ?one? ?school??open? ?is? 
 
The rule above requires the modifier to be a 
noun and places a constraint ?place_close? on it. 
We map this constraint (place_close) with some set 
of lexical items found in a synset of a hypernym 
obtained from WordNet. For example, 
?place_close? might correspond to ?housing?, 
?lodging?, ?building?, etc in a synset. In essence 
?place_close? is place holder for different relations 
which might be present in a synset. The modified 
category and the modifier category can be ex-
tracted after the correct parse of the PP is known; 
the constraints applied on the modified and modi-
fier item (point c, e above) can be of various kinds, 
some of them are; 
 
? Semantic relations corresponding to 
WordNet hypernyms for a given word 
? Presence of the lexical item in some list 
(eg. verb class) 
? Semantic property such as ?time? or ?place? 
? Lexical property such as aspect, negativity 
etc. 
 
 
 
 
The constraints specified in a tuple can be com-
bined together using logical operators such as 
?and?, ?or?, ?negation?. So, for a single rule, multi-
54
ple constraints can be introduced. For a sense, if 
needed, complex constraints can be introduced 
which must be satisfied. 
 
#for, v, L2:for.dat && aspect:continuous, n, time, 
for%p%5 
 
 (8) He has been playing for years. 
     ?vaha   kaii      saalo   se    khela   rahaa   hai ? 
      ?He? ?many? ?years? ?for? ?play? ?cont.?  ?is? 
 
The above rule (for the Hindi translation) has 
two constraints for the modified (which is a verb in 
this case), the two constraints have been combined 
using an ?and? operator (represented using two 
ampersands, ?&&?). Only if the two constraints are 
satisfied, the constraint is considered as satisfied 
else it is considered as failed. The use of different 
logical operator gives a lot of expressive power to 
a single rule. Sometimes it might be desirable to 
place multiple constraints together, because for a 
given sense these constraints always occur together, 
and by listing them as separate rules we will miss 
out the fact that they co-occur.  
It is not always necessary (or possible) to fill the 
constraint fields. In fact, sometimes it is even de-
sirable to leave them unspecified. In such a case 
we place a hyphen in that field, such as the follow-
ing rule; 
 
# at, v, -, n, place_close, at%p%5 
 
In the above rule, the constraint for the modified 
field is unspecified. There are also cases when it is 
not desirable to have a translated preposition corre-
sponding to its source;  
 
# to, L: verbs.txt, -, n, place, ZZ 
 
(9) He went to Delhi. 
      ?vaha dilli     gayaa? (in hnd) 
       ?He? ?Delhi? ?went? 
 
The ?ZZ? in the above rule signifies that the 
translated sentence will have no preposition corre-
sponding to the preposition ?to? when it occurs 
with certain verbs which are specified by 
?L:verbs.txt? (?verbs.txt? is a list of verbs). For the 
above Hindi sentence post-position ?ko? can  
 
         2 List 
perhaps be introduced, i.e. ?vaha dilli ko gayaa?, 
but ?vaha dilli gayaa? is more natural, and the 
translated sentence is better off without a ?ko?.  
Finally, each preposition handled has a default 
rule, which is applied at the end when all the other 
rules for that preposition fail; the sense given by  
the default rule is based on the most frequent usage 
of the preposition at the target side. All the fields 
(except the first and last) in the default rule have 
hyphens. The default rule for ?to? is written below; 
 
to, -, -, -, -, to%p%1 
 
Some of the rules in the rule file are given below, 
for ease of comprehension, we mention the actual 
target sense instead of the dictionary id for the last 
field (the actual rule file has dictionary sense id) 
 
at, v, L:peer_verbs.txt, n, -, kii tarapha 
at, v, L:transaction_verbs.txt, n, price, meM 
for, v, -, n, distance, taka 
in, n, animate, n, place, kaa 
on, v, -, n, time, ko 
to, v, L:go_verbs.txt, n, animate|authority, ke 
paasa 
with, v, -, n, instrument, se 
2.3 Recap 
We briefly describe the various steps of the al-
gorithm again; 
 
(a) Given a raw sentence we feed it to the 
Shakti MT system which performs various 
source language analysis, for our algo-
rithm, information such as PP attachment 
and correct identification of the phrasal 
verb (if present) is crucial. 
(b) The output of step (a) is taken by our 
module which automatically constructs 
the six field tuple described above. At this 
point we can only fill some fields, which 
are field 1 (source language preposition), 
field 2 (modified category) and field 4 
(modifier category). 
(c) We then compare this constructed tuple 
with the appropriate tuples present in the 
rule file. For this constructed tuple to sat-
isfy the various constraints mentioned in 
the tuple with which it is compared re-
sources such as place filter, time filter, 
lists and WordNet are consulted automati-
55
cally. The order in which we use these re-
sources has been already been mentioned 
in section 2.1. The tuple for which all the 
constraints are satisfied is selected, the 
last field of this tuple contains the diction-
ary id of the sense. 
(d) Output the selected sense. 
3 Evaluation 
For the current study, experiments were conducted 
with 6 high frequency prepositions, they are; at, 
for, in, on, to, and with. The algorithm was tested 
on 100 sentences for each preposition in both the 
language pairs, i.e., 600 sentences for English-
Hindi and 600 sentences for English-Telugu. These 
sentences were randomly extracted from the 
ERDC3 corpus. The corpus contains text from dif-
ferent domains such as medicine, sports, history, 
etc. The input to the implemented system was 
manually checked and corrected to make sure that 
there were no errors in the information which is 
expected by the system. The bulk of these correc-
tions involved rectifying the wrong PP attachment 
given by the parser and the mistakes in phrasal 
verb identification.

3.1 Performance 
The tables above show the performance of the sys-
tem and compares it with the baseline score (BL). 
BL is the precision of the system with only the de-
fault sense. The tables also show the number of 
sense which English prepositions can take on the 
target side. Table 1 and Table 2 show English-
Hindi and English-Telugu results respectively. 
The implemented system gives very promising 
results. Certain prepositions give comparably low 
precision. The reasons for the inappropriate sense 
selection are discussed in the next section. The 
English-Telugu results (Table 2)  show same 
system precision and BL for some preposition (?in? 
and ?to?). This is because these prepositions have 
less number of sense on the target side and all the 
instances found in the test data had the default 
sense.   
3.2 Error analysis 
The errors made by the system were analyzed and 
the major reasons for inappropriate sense selection 
were;  
  
(a) Noise generated by WordNet, 
(b) Special constructions, 
(c) Metonymy, 
(d) Ambiguous sentences, 
(e) Presence of very general constraints. 
 
The problem of noise generation by WordNet 
sometimes leads to surprising and unexpected 
sense selection; this is because in WordNet a noun 
or verb will have multiple sense, and each of these 
senses will have various levels of hypernym syn-
sets, so, while finding various concepts/features 
(specified by the rule for a preposition) we need to 
look at each one of these senses. We need to do 
this because we currently don?t have the sense in-
formation. So, an inappropriate sense might some-
times satisfy the constraint(s) and result in inap-
propriate selection. The solution for this will obvi-
ously be to identify the correct sense of modi-
fier/modified prior to getting its semantic property 
from the WordNet.  
There are certain constructions in which the 
head noun of the PP is a pronoun, which refers 
back to a noun. For us this will create a problem, in 
such cases we will first need to get the referent 
56
noun and then apply the constraints on it, take the 
following example; 
 
(10) The rate at which these reactions occur is 
known as rate of metabolism. 
 
In the above example, the head noun of the PP 
(at which) refers to the noun (rate) on which we 
need to apply the constraints. At present the 
coreference information is not available to us, 
therefore in such cases the algorithm fails to give 
the correct output. 
The other reason for failure was the ambiguity 
of the sentence itself which could be interpreted in 
various ways, like the example below; 
 
(11) Andamaan should go to India. 
 
The above sentence can be interpreted (and 
translated) in two ways, the hindi translations for 
the two interpretation are; 
 
(11a) ?andamaan    indiaa  ko   jaanaa  chahiye? 
          ?Andamaan? ?India?  ?to?  ?go?     ?should? 
   India should get Andaman. 
 
(11b) ?andamaan   ko   indiaa   jaanaa  chahiye? 
          ?Andamaan? ?to? ?India?  ?visit?    ?should? 
   Andaman should visit India. 
 
In (11a) we get the sense that the 
possesion/control of ?Andamaan? should go to 
?India?, and in (11b) it is ?Andamaan? (the 
government of ?Andamaan?) which is going to 
?India? (the government of India), as in, The United 
States should go to UK, also in (11b) we can have 
?Andamaan? as somebodys? name, as in, Ram 
should go to India. In such cases we failed to get 
the appropriate translation of the preposition as it 
in turn depends on the correct interpretation of the 
whole sentence. Ambiguity of numerals in a 
sentence is yet another case which lead to faliure, 
like the following example; 
 
(12) At 83, Vajpayee is overweight. 
 
In the above sentence, the number 83 can either 
mean this persons? (Vajpayee) age or his weight. 
The target side translation takes different 
preposition sense for these two interpretation. 
Hindi takes para and in Telugu ?at? is not-
translated when we treat 83 as weight, and when 
treated as age, we get mem and lo/ki in Hindi and 
Telugu respectively. 
We found that certain prepositions occur in large 
number of metonymical usage, like, ?with? and 
?at?. The constraints in a rule have been formulated 
for the general usage and not the extended usage of 
a given word. The example below shows one such 
instance; 
 
(13) Great bowlers spend hours after hours at 
the nets. 
 
While looking in WordNet for the various 
senses of ?net? not a single sense matches with the 
kind of usage in which ?net? is used in the above 
sentence. 
Certain rules for some of the preposition were 
found to be very general, the low performance of 
?for? and ?to? in telugu and hindi respectively are 
mainly due to this reason. In general, formulating 
rules (English-Hindi) for preposition ?to? was very 
difficult. This was because ?to? can have around 10 
senses in Hindi. The rules with very general 
constraints tend to satisfy cases where they should 
have failed. One has to revisit them and revise 
them. 
4 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper we described an approach to select 
the appropriate sense for a preposition from an 
English to Indian language MT perspective, we 
discussed the issues involved in the task, we ex-
plained the steps to achieve the required task; 
which are, semantic and context extraction, and 
sense selection. We reported the performance of 
the system, and showed that our approach gives 
promising results. We also discussed the identified 
problems during the error analysis; such as noise 
generation by WordNet. 
One of the pertinent tasks for the future would 
be to come up with a solution to reduce the noise 
generated by WordNet. The scope of rule file in 
terms of handling more prepositions needs to be 
broadened. We would like to extend this work to 
handle complex preposition. Finally, we would like 
to explore if ML techniques can be combined with 
the rule base to exploit the benefits of both the ap-
proaches.
