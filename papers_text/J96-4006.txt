1. Introduction 
A long-standing debate in the computational linguistic community is about the gen- 
erality of lexical taxonomies. Many linguists (Nirenburg 1995; Hirst 1995) stress that 
taxonomies that are not language neutral, at least at the intermediate and high level, 
have little hope of success. On the other hand, lexicon builders who have experience 
of designing taxonomies for real applications claim that in sublanguages there exist 
very domain-dependent similarity relations. Given our experience and results, we are 
inclined to take the second position, but we are indeed sensitive to the theoretical 
motivations of the first. 
The problem is that the similarity relations uggested by the thematic structures of 
words 1 in sentences are highly domain dependent, and it is difficult, though perhaps 
not impossible, to find common invariants across sublanguages when this model of 
word similarity is adopted. On the other hand, conceptual, or compositional models 
of similarity are much more difficult to understand and formalize on a systematic 
basis, because of the difficulty of defining a commonly agreed upon set of semantic 
primitives into which words may be decomposed. 
It may be possible, however, and highly interesting, to integrate the results of a 
purely inductive method, such as the conceptual clustering system CIAULA (Basili, 
Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c, 1996a), and a hand-encoded, omain-general classifica- 
tion, such as, for example, WordNet. The purpose of one such experiment, which 
we describe in this paper, is to find some points of contact between psychologically 
motivated models, as WordNet, and data-driven models, as CIAULA. 2 
2. Detecting Verb Similarities with a Sublanguage 
To analyze verb similarities, we used CIAULA, a conceptual clustering algorithm for 
word classification, which we applied to the task of verb categorization. We will not 
provide details of the specific algorithm used (they may be found in works referred 
to above), we will simply summarize the main features of the system.

CIAULA is an unsupervised learning algorithm for incremental concept formation, 
based on an augmented version of the well-known COBWEB (Fisher 1987). 
The input observations (instances) for our concept-formation algorithm are verb 
observations in sentences, represented by their generalized thematic structures, ac- 
quired semiautomatically from corpora by ARIOSTO_LEX (Basili, Pazienza, and Ve- 
lardi 1993a, 1993b, 1996b). 
In CIAULA, the thematic roles of a verb v in a sentence are represented by a 
feature-vector: 
v/(Ri, : Catit) it @ I, jt E J t = 1,2 . . . . .  n (1) 
In (1), Ri, are the conceptual relations, or thematic roles (agentive, instrument, etc.) 
and Carl, are the conceptual types of the words to which v is related semantically. 
Conceptual relations are assigned semiautomatically. Conceptual types are assigned 
either manually (in Italian, since no on-line resources are available) or automatically, 
using WordNet. 
For example, the following sentence in an English remote sensing domain (here- 
after RSD): 
... the satellite produced information with high accuracy 
originates the instance: 
(2) produce / (MANNER: PROPERTY, 
AFFECTED: ABSTRACTION, 
INSTRUMENT: INSTRUMENTALITY ) 
Semantic similarity is strongly suggested by the observation of verb configurations, 
in which words of the same conceptual type play the same roles. 
Distinguishing features of CIAULA are:

2. 
Treatment of ambiguity and polysemy. In contrast o classical conceptual 
clustering algorithms, CIAULA accounts for multiple instances of the 
same concept, that is, of the same verb. 
Identi~cation of most representative clusters. The method identifies the 
basic-level categories (Rosch 1978) for an acquired hierarchy of verbs, 
i.e., those bringing the most predictive information about their members. 
The results of repeated experiments showed that CIAULA is able, upon an appro- 
priate setting of the model parameters, to detect similarity relations in the thematic 
structure of verbs, and to provide a probabilistic and semantic description of the ac- 
quired clusters. We observed that, by tuning the model parameters to obtain clusters 
of "very similar" instances, a percentage varying between 30% and 60% of verbs (de- 
pending upon the number of input observations) belong to singletons, that is, are not 
"similar enough" to any other verb. If we relax these constraints, we obtain larger 
clusters and fewer singletons, but verbs in a cluster are less semantically close to each 
other. 
In Figure 1 we show two basic-level categories obtained with different values of 
the model parameters, for the RSD. For each cluster member, the local and global 
membership is shown. Members of Class 1,870 are verbs that take an abstraction (ABS) 
as a direct object. Class 1,603 was generated in a different run, in which we imposed 
a tighter similarity among the cluster members. The verbs in this category take with

The similarity relations detected by CIAULA cannot be used tout court as a tax- 
onomy in a NLP system. However, they can be used to tune a general-purpose taxon- 
omy to a specific domain, by reducing sense ambiguity and identifying new, domain- 
specific senses. For example, the predicted thematic structure for the cluster 1,603 
shows that the verb to deal has a more specific use than in general language. In the 
RSD, algorithms/ABS deal with parameters/pa . . . .  
Cross-linguistic experiments (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1996b) showed that sim- 
ilarity relations are different in different domains, which raises the issue of detecting 
language invariants, that is, a language-neutral ontology (at least at the highest levels). 
Our contribution to this long-standing issue will be empirical, rather than methodolog- 
ical. 
3. Analysing the Relations between Corpus-induced and 
Human-deduced Categories 
In this section, we propose amethod to analyze the relations between a domain-general 
ontology, such as WordNet, derived by linguists eeking language-neutral principles, 
and our example-driven clusters, derived by CIAULA. The purpose of this analysis 
is not to validate CIAULA with WordNet, nor to augment WordNet with CIAULA. 
Rather, our purpose is to identify commonalities and discrepancies, and to investigate 
the possibility of profitably integrating the two approaches. 
One of the motivations for using WordNet is that, in WordNet, verb meaning is 
represented in terms of semantic relations, rather than semantic primitives (Miller and 
Fellbaum 1991). Hence, in principle, WordNet and CIAULA adopt the same relational 
561

Let C be a cluster automatically derived by CIAULA (Basili et al 1996a). A cluster 
is simply a set of verbs modeled by means of a graded membership function, 
i.e., the local membership of verbs, #(v, C) (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c). 
Let S(v) be the set of senses of the verb v. 
For each sense s in S(v), the set of WordNet hyperonims of s is defined. Let 
syns(v) denote this set, i.e., 
= { yns 13s c S(v),s is_a syns} 
The is~ relation denote the transitive closure of WordNet IS_A: syns(v) is the set 
of possible (ambiguous) WordNet hyperonims of the verb v, through its senses 
(i.e., S(v)). 
Let syns(C) denote the set of all hyperonims of at least one verb v in C, i.e., 
Let V(syns, C) be the set of verbs of a given cluster C that are hyponyms of syns. 
Formally, 
The preference score g is a real-valued function defined by: 
1 
g(syns) = Z IS(v)t 
vCV(syns,C) 
where I I denotes cardinality. 
The best Wordnet label syns for the cluster C is the one that maximizes g.

approach to describe verbs and detect similarities. To investigate the commonalities 
between CIAULA and WordNet we decided to automatically select he best WordNet 
concept as a label to assign to each acquired CIAULA cluster. 
Let vi be the members of a CIAULA basic-level cluster C, S(vi) the synsets for each 
vi and h(S(vi)), or  hi, the set of supertypes (hyperonims) ofS(vi). If gr(hi) is the number 
of incoming IS_A arcs for a supertype, that is the number of synsets of vi that point 
to hi, an intuitive algorithm would be to select as the best supertype for a cluster the 
one that maximizes gr(hi) values. 
Things, however, are more complex. First, we must apply some normalization i
order to reduce the noise caused by the more ambiguous verbs. Second, we must 
balance the effect of verbs that have more than one synset pointing to the same hi. 
In fact, a supertype could gain evidence only because several senses of the same 
verb point to it. Finally, the algorithm must avoid the selection of excessively general 
categories, like create, make. Figure 2 describes the algorithm more formally. 
During a first experiment, we ran the tagging algorithm using unrestricted sets 
of verbs first clustered by CIAULA. Because of the relatively sparse examples, the 
over generality of WordNet and the over specificity of CIAULA produced limited 
interactions. In some cases, CIAULA clusters received a "pertinent" WordNet sense 
label, but in some cases they did not. A "good" example in a legal domain in Italian

(hereafter LD) is the class: evaluate, regulate, assign, determine, xamine, resolve, maintain 
that received the label: judge, form an opinion of, pass judgement on. A "bad" choice in the 
same domain, is the class: indicate, establish, foresee, determine that received the overly 
general abel: create, make. On average, we were satisfied with one-half of the tags 
assigned to clusters. 
This evaluation was performed by inspection, hence it is purely empirical. Given 
a set of examples of verb uses, we can more or less easily tell whether a conceptual 
definition in terms of thematic structures (as provided by CIAULA) is appropriate or 
not. But it is much more difficult o say whether, for example, the CIAULA class mea- 
sure, propose, derive, evaluate, discover, classify, describe, calculate is appropriately described 
by the WordNet label communicate, transmit houghts, transmit feelings. 
In WordNet, there are limited definitions of the conceptual labels used, or hyper- 
onims. In general, lists of words or phrases are used in place of a single label, so 
that the reader may have an idea of what is really meant. But the higher the node, the 
deeper the "meaning" behind a hyperonim, the harder is the human task of evaluating 
the appropriateness of a classification. 
Looking more in detail, the problem with misclassifications is twofold. In some 
cases, the problem is the overambiguity and the very fine-grained concept labels 
adopted in WordNet. Especially with large CIAULA clusters, the number of synsets 
becomes too large, and the algorithm does not gain enough evidence of any sig- 
nificantly promising pattern in the hierarchy. The second problem is the overspeci- 
ficity of CIAULA. For example, verbs in the second cluster of the previous exam- 
ple (i.e., the "bad" choice), have been clustered because they occurred in patterns 
like: the laW~DoCUMENT indicates (establish, determine... ) the deadline/TaMeorcaa_ENT~Ty for the 
presentation .. . .  It is unlikely that the linguists who developed WordNet had in mind 
such a narrow use of these verbs when classifying them. 
WordNet labels for CIAULA classes are somewhat overly general. Different 
CIAULA clusters received the same WordNet label, and this was used as a hint to 
further structure the induced classification. An example is shown in Figure 3. The 
resulting taxonomy is built under a default node. 
In a second set of experiments, we ran CIAULA on a more homogeneous set of 
verbs. Rather than inducing verb categories from scratch, we augmented the seman- 
tic bias of CIAULA by preclassifying all the verbs in the RSD using the 15 WordNet 
semantic domains for verbs, which are: bodily care, change, cognition, communication, 
563 
Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 
competition, consumption, contact, creation, emotion, motion, perception, possession, social in- 
teraction, stative, and weather. We then fed CIAULA with groups of verbs belonging to 
each of these categories. Of course, many of these verbs are ambiguous, but we used 
a probabilistic method (Basili et al 1995) to select he observations of each verb that 
are genuine examples of a semantic domain. 
This experiment produced rather appropriate classifications. Table 1 shows the 
labels assigned to some basic-level clusters generated by CIAULA for the RSD verbs 
belonging to the semantic ategory cognition. Figure 4 shows an excerpt of the CIAULA 
clusters of Table 1, with the prototypical description of each cluster. 
In Table I the fourth column (Overlap Score) is the ratio between verbs in a cluster 
(column 1) that belong to the WordNet synset of column 3, and the cardinality of the 
cluster. In fact the best synset for a cluster does not necessarily cover all the cluster 
members. In the full experiment, 67% of the clusters have a score _> 0.5, indicating a 
good overlap between CIAULA and WordNet. Worst clusters, as far as the overlap 
score is concerned, are those in which there are very high-level and ambiguous verbs, 
like make. These verbs usually produce noise, because of WordNet ambiguity and of 
the spurious (for the category) input examples fed to CIAULA. 
There are instead clusters with a low overlap score that seem very appropriate if
one looks at the usage patterns in the corpus. For examples, the verbs of cluster 2,725 
in Table I are highly characterized (i.e., have high local membership values) by the fact 
that they take as object some physical PROPERTY (PR) of a NATURAL_OBJECT. If we 
consider the prototypical descriptions of clusters globally, we observe recurrent pat- 
terns of use of the clustered verbs. Verbs of cognition in the RSD are strongly character- 
ized by a MENTAL OBJECT (MO), or COGNITIVE_PROCESS (CO), or ABSTRACTION 
(ABS), in the position of direct object (AFFECTED). Frequently, the object of a cognition 
verb is a physical PROPERTY or a NATURAL_OBJECT, and the analysis is performed 
with some INSTRUMENTALITY (INS) (... cloud parameters are derived from satellite... )
In order to analyze the correspondence/divergence between human-coded verb 
classes and data-driven clusters we can compare the argument structure proposed 
for the synsets in WordNet and the intentional description of the classes, i.e., the 
prototypical semantic patterns of CIAULA clusters (Figure 4). 
The WordNet argument structure for verbs, however, simply provides a qualitative 
description of the possible phrasal patterns in which verbs in a given synset can be 
used. For example the sense record, enter, put down, make a record of of the verb to record 
(line 1 in Table 1), is described by 
(3) {Somebody, Something} records {something, somebody} 
Somebody records that CLAUSE 
As shown, the information available is mainly syntactic, with the exception of the 
ANIMATE/INANIMATE distinction for the arguments. 
The classification of CIAULA assigns the verb to record to four classes: (1) record, 
enter, put down, make a record of, (2) decide, make up one's mind, decide upon, determine, 
(3) create, make, and (4) investigate, look into, as shown in Table 1. The different classes 
are characterized by the following semantic patterns, as shown in Figure 4:

record. Within the general properties of taking an (INANIMATE or 
ANIMATE) entity as subject and object, however, CIAULA specifies the 
semantics of the object and subject typical of the domain. For example 
(see cluster 4,170) in this domain, the activity of recording, evaluating, 
plotting a PROPERTY (e.g., sea surface temperature, wind speed . . . .  ) is 
significant; 
In some cases the (weak) semantic expectations on the argument 
structure in WordNet are violated. For example, in pattern (ii), a 
COGNITIVE_PROCESS rather than somebody is the agentive of to record 
(e.g., the algorithm~co records the changes... ) and of the other members of 
the class labeled decide, make up one's mind, decide upon, determine (cluster 
3,637). 
Some relations are not predicted by WordNet, as for example pattern 
(iii). Locative relations are treated in WordNet as lexical adjuncts of the 
verb to record. However, they seem very relevant in the sublanguage (as 
for example in sentences like: . . .  pollutants are recorded and analyzed in 
surface waters, temperature is recorded (collected) in the bay area ...  ). It seems 
that (some) lexical adjuncts may play an important role in the definition 
of domain-specific senses of verbs. 
566 
Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi Verb Classification 
It appears that much information relevant for the lexical encoding of verbs is do- 
main specific and is completely missing in a general-purpose classification like Word- 
Net. Therefore, semantically driven NL interpreters may profitably be augmented with 
the information obtained by merging these different sources. 
A further interesting issue is related to identical tags assigned to different clus- 
ters. Verbs in these classes hould express imilar acts or events. An analysis of the 
prototypical patterns that CIAULA assigns to these classes uggests that despite the 
shared WordNet ags, verbs in these classes are very different. 
For example, the classes 2,383, 2,055, 3,518, 2,102, 914 are all labeled create, make, 
a very general synset in WordNet. Their patterns are very different, and show almost 
no overlap. The main motivation for this divergence between WordNet tagging and 
the meanings of CIAULA clusters is twofold. On the one hand, CIAULA clusters are 
very fine grained, as they are built from single observations ofverb uses. On the other 
hand, WordNet is often missing most of these precise (technical) uses of verbs. As 
a result, the labeling algorithm of Figure 2 is forced to generalize over many levels, 
with a consequent loss of information. The argument structure of the reached synset 
is thus too generic. It is worth noticing that even in these cases, we still achieve 
useful information, since the WordNet argument structure can be further specified by 
domain-specific semantic onstraints. The class 2,055, for example, may be described 
by an extended argument structure like 
(4) {Somebody, Something} makes {X}, 
where X is an ABSTRACTION 
4. Conclusions 
The results illustrated in this paper are very interesting, though not conclusive. Verbs 
are vessels for human creativity in language communication, and so much is left to 
further studies. We discovered thematic features that are apparently more "basic" than 
others, with respect o a given semantic domain (cognition) and a given sublanguage 
(RSD). We could specify features that were described at a very general level in Word- 
Net, and detect semantic restrictions specific to the sublanguage, not accounted for in 
WordNet. These results uggest that, with appropriate customization, it is still possible 
to exploit he information i  general-purpose on-line thesauri that would be otherwise 
almost unusable in real NLP applications. As proposed in this paper, an appropriate 
process of lexical tuning can significantly reduce the overgenerality (excessive am- 
biguity) and underspecificity (weak constraints on verb argument structures) that is 
typical of general-purpose resources.
