Abstract
We describe a new information fusion 
approach to integrate facts extracted 
from cross-media objects (videos and 
texts) into a coherent common represen-
tation including multi-level knowledge 
(concepts, relations and events). Beyond 
standard information fusion, we ex-
ploited video extraction results and sig-
nificantly improved text Information Ex-
traction. We further extended our meth-
ods to multi-lingual environment (Eng-
lish, Arabic and Chinese) by presenting 
a case study on cross-lingual comparable 
corpora acquisition based on video com-
parison.
1 Introduction 
An enormous amount of information is widely 
available in various data modalities (e.g. speech, 
text, image and video). For example, a Web 
news page about ?Health Care Reform in 
America? is composed with texts describing 
some events (e.g., Final Senate vote for the 
reform plans, Obama signs the reform 
agreement), images (e.g., images about various 
government involvements over decades) and 
videos/speech (e.g. Obama?s speech video about 
the decisions) containing additional information 
regarding the real extent of the events or 
providing evidence corroborating the text part. 
These cross-media objects exist in redundant 
and complementary structures, and therefore it 
is beneficial to fuse information from various 
data modalities. The goal of our paper is to 
investigate this task from both mono-lingual and 
cross-lingual perspectives. 
  The processing methods of texts and 
images/videos are typically organized into two 
separate pipelines. Each pipeline has been 
studied separately and quite intensively over the 
past decade. It is critical to move away from 
single media processing, and instead toward 
methods that make multiple decisions jointly 
using cross-media inference. For example, video 
analysis allows us to find both entities and 
events in videos, but it?s very challenging to 
specify some fine-grained semantic types such 
as proper names (e.g. ?Obama Barack?) and 
relations among concepts; while the speech 
embedded and the texts surrounding these 
videos can significantly enrich such analysis. On 
the other hand, image/video features can 
enhance text extraction.  For example, entity 
gender detection from speech recognition output 
is challenging because of entity mention 
recognition errors. However, gender detection 
from corresponding images and videos can 
achieve above 90% accuracy (Baluja and Rowley, 
2006). In this paper, we present a case study on 
gender detection to demonstrate how text and 
video extractions can boost each other. 
  We can further extend the benefit of cross-
media inference to cross-lingual information 
extraction (CLIE). Hakkani-Tur et al (2007) 
found that CLIE performed notably worse than 
monolingual IE, and indicated that a major 
cause was the low quality of machine translation 
(MT). Current statistical MT methods require 
large and manually aligned parallel corpora as 
input for each language pair of interest. Some 
recent work (e.g. Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Ji, 
2009) found that MT can benefit from multi-
lingual comparable corpora (Cheung and Fung, 
2004), but it is time-consuming to identify pairs 
of comparable texts; especially when there is 
630
lack of parallel information such as news release 
dates and topics. However, the images/videos 
embedded in the same documents can provide 
additional clues for similarity computation 
because they are ?language-independent?. We 
will show how a video-based comparison 
approach can reliably build large comparable 
text corpora for three languages: English, 
Chinese and Arabic. 
2 Baseline Systems 
We apply the following state-of-the-art text and 
video information extraction systems as our 
baselines. Each system can produce reliable 
confidence values based on statistical models. 
2.1 Video Concept Extraction 
The video concept extraction system was 
developed by IBM for the TREC Video 
Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID-2005) 
(Naphade et al, 2005). This system can extract 
2617 concepts defined by TRECVID, such as 
"Hospital", "Airplane" and "Female-Person". It 
uses support vector machines to learn the 
mapping between low level features extracted 
from visual modality as well as from transcripts 
and production related meta-features. It also 
exploits a Correlative Multi-label Learner (Qi et 
al., 2007), a Multi-Layer Multi-Instance Kernel 
(Gu et al, 2007) and Label Propagation through 
Linear Neighborhoods (Wang et al, 2006) to 
extract all other high-level features. For each 
classifier, different models are trained on a set 
of different modalities (e.g., the color moments, 
wavelet textures, and edge histograms), and the 
predictions made by these classifiers are 
combined together with a hierarchical linearly-
weighted fusion strategy across different 
modalities and classifiers. 
2.2 Text Information Extraction 
We use a state-of-the-art IE system (Ji and 
Grishman, 2008) developed for the Automatic 
Content Extraction (ACE) program1 to process 
texts and automatic speech recognition output. 
The pipeline includes name tagging, nominal 
mention tagging, coreference resolution, time 
expression extraction and normalization, rela-
tion extraction and event extraction. Entities 
1 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ 
include coreferred persons, geo-political entities 
(GPE), locations, organizations, facilities, vehi-
cles and weapons; relations include 18 types 
(e.g. ?a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg?
indicates a located relation.); events include the 
33 distinct event types defined in ACE 2005 
(e.g. ?Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief 
of Vivendi Universal Entertainment.? indicates a 
?personnel-start? event). Names are identified 
and classified using an HMM-based name tag-
ger. Nominals are identified using a maximum 
entropy-based chunker and then semantically 
classified using statistics from ACE training 
corpora. Relation extraction and event extraction 
are also based on maximum entropy models, 
incorporating diverse lexical, syntactic, semantic 
and ontological knowledge.

and Inference

approach. After we apply two baseline systems 
to the multi-media documents, we use a novel 
multi-level concept fusion approach to extract a 
common knowledge representation across texts 
and videos (section 3.2), and then apply a global 
inference approach to enhance fusion results 
(section 3.3). 
3.2 Cross-media Information Fusion 
? Concept Mapping 
For each input video, we apply automatic speech 
recognition to obtain background texts. Then we 
use the baseline IE systems described in section 
2 to extract concepts from texts and videos. We 
construct mappings on the overlapped facts 
across TRECVID and ACE. For example, 
?LOC.Water-Body? in ACE is mapped to 
?Beach, Lakes, Oceans, River, River_Bank? in 
TRECVID.
  Due to different characteristics of video clips 
and texts, these two tasks have quite different 
granularities and focus. For example, 
?PER.Individual? in ACE is an open set includ-
ing arbitrary names, while TRECVID only cov-
ers some famous proper names such as 
?Hu_Jintao? and ?John_Edwards?. Geopolitical 
entities appear very rarely in TRECVID because 
they are more explicitly presented in back-
ground texts. On the other hand, TRECVID de-
fined much more fine-grained nominals than 
ACE, for example, ?FAC.Building-Grounds? in 
ACE can be divided into 52 possible concept
types such as ?Conference_Buildings? and 
?Golf_Course? because they can be more easily 
detected based on video features. We also notice 
that TRECVID concepts can include multiple 
levels of ACE facts, for example 
?WEA_Shooting? concept can be separated into 
?weapon? entities and ?attack? events in ACE. 
These different definitions bring challenges to 
cross-media fusion but also opportunities to ex-
ploit complementary facts to refine both pipe-
lines. We manually resolved these issues and 
obtained 20 fused concept sets. 
? Time-stamp based Multi-level Projection 
After extracting facts from videos and texts, we 
conduct information fusion at all possible levels: 
name, nominal, coreference link, relation or 
event mention. We rely on the timestamp infor-
mation associated with video keyframes or shots 
(sequential keyframes) and background speech 
to align concepts. During this fusion process, we 
compare the normalized confidence values pro-
duced from two pipelines to resolve the follow-
ing three types of cases:
? Contradiction ? A video fact contradicts a 
text fact; we only keep the fact with higher 
confidence.
? Redundancy ? A video fact conveys the 
same content as (or entails, or is entailed by) 
a text fact; we only keep the unique parts of 
the facts. 
? Complementary ? A video fact and a text 
fact are complementary; we merge these 
two to form more complete fact sets. 
? A Common Representation 
In order to effectively extract compact informa-
tion from large amounts of heterogeneous data, 
we design an integrated XML format to repre-
sent the facts extracted from the above multi-
level fusion. We can view this representation as 
a set of directed ?information graphs? G={Gi
(Vi, Ei)}, where Vi is the collection of concepts 
from both texts and videos, and Ei is the collec-
tion of edges linking one concept to the other, 
labeled by relation or event attributes. An exam-
ple is presented in Figure 2. This common rep-
resentation is applied in both mono-lingual and 
multi-lingual information fusion tasks described 
in next sections.

fact representation  
3.3 Cross-media Information Inference 
? Uncertainty Problem in Cross-Media Fu-
sion
However, such a simple merging approach usu-
ally leads to unsatisfying results due to uncer-
tainty. Uncertainty in multimedia is induced 
from noise in the data acquisition procedure

(e.g., noise in automatic speech recognition re-
sults and low-quality camera surveillance vid-
eos) as well as human errors and subjectivity. 
Unstructured texts, especially those translated 
from foreign languages, are difficult to interpret. 
In addition, automatic IE systems for both vid-
eos and texts tend to produce errors.  
? Case Study on Mention Gender Detection 
We employ cross-media inference methods to 
reduce uncertainty. We will demonstrate this 
approach on a case study of gender detection for 
persons. Automatic gender detection is crucial 
to many natural language processing tasks such 
as pronoun reference resolution (Bergsma, 
2005). Gender detection for last names has 
proved challenging; Gender for nominals can be 
highly ambiguous in various contexts. Unfortu-
nately most state-of-the-art approaches discover 
gender information without considering specific 
contexts in the document. The results were 
stored either as a knowledge base with prob-
abilities (e.g. Ji and Lin, 2009) or as a static 
gazetteer (e.g. census data). Furthermore, speech 
recognition normally performs poorly on names, 
which brings more challenges to gender detec-
tion for mis-spelled names.   
  We consider two approaches as our baselines. 
The first baseline is to discover gender knowl-
edge from Google N-grams using specific lexi-
cal patterns (e.g. ?[mention] and 
his/her/its/their?) (Ji and Lin, 2009). The other 
baseline is a gazetteer matching approach based 
on census data including person names and gen-
der information, as used in typical text IE sys-
tems.  
  We introduce the third method based on 
male/female concept extraction from associated 
background videos. These concepts are detected 
from context-dependent features (e.g. face rec-
ognition). If there are multiple persons in one 
snippet associated with one shot, we propagate 
gender information to all instances.
  We then linearly combine these three methods 
based on confidence values. For example, the 
confidence of predicting a name mention n as a 
male (M) can be computed by combining prob-
abilities P(n, M, method):
confidence(n,male)=?1*P(n,M,ngram)+
?2*P(n,M,census) +?3*P(n,M,video)
  In this paper we used?1=0.1, ?2=0.1 
and?3=0.8 which are optimized from a devel-
opment set. 
4 Cross-lingual Comparable Corpora 
Acquisition
In this section we extend the information fusion 
approach to a task of discovering comparable 
corpora.
4.1 Comparable Documents  
Figure 3 presents an example of cross-lingual 
comparable documents. They are both about the 
rescue activities for the Haiti earthquake.

  Traditional text translation based methods tend 
to miss such pairs due to poor translation quality 
of informative words (Ji et al, 2009). However, 
the background videos and images are language-
independent and thus can be exploited to iden-
tify such comparable documents. This provides 
a cross-media approach to break language bar-
rier.
4.2 Cross-lingual System Overview 
Figure 4 presents the general pipeline of discov-
ering cross-lingual comparable documents based 
on background video comparison. The detailed 
video similarity computation method is pre-
sented in next section. 
4.3 Video Concept Similarity Computation 
Most document clustering systems use represen-
tations built out of the lexical and syntactic at-
tributes. These attributes may involve string 
matching, agreement, syntactic distance, and 
document release dates. Although gains have 
been made with such methods, there are clearly 
cases where shallow information will not be suf-
ficient to resolve clustering correctly. Therefore, 
we should therefore expect a successful docu-
ment comparison approach to exploit world 
knowledge, inference, and other forms of se-
mantic information in order to resolve hard 
cases. For example, if two documents include 
concepts referring to male-people, earthquake 
event, rescue activities, and facility-grounds 
with similar frequency information, we can de-
termine they are likely to be comparable. In this 
paper we represent each video as a vector of 
semantic concepts extracted from videos and 
then use standard vector space model to com-
pute similarity.  
  Let A=(a1, ?a|?|) and B=(b1, ?b|?|) be such 
vectors for a pair of videos, then we use cosine 
similarity to compute similarity:

where |? | contains all possible concepts. We 
use traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse 
Document Frequency) weights for the vector 
elements ai and bi. Let C be a unique concept, V
is a video consisting of a series of k shots V = 
{S1, ?, Sk}, then:

Let p(C, Si) denote the probability that C is ex-

compute term frequency tf (C, Si):
(1) ( , ) ( , )i itf C S confidence C S=
and
(2) ( , )( , ) iconfidence C Sitf C S ?=
Where Confidence (C, Si) denotes the probabil-
ity of detecting a concept C in a shot Si:
( , ) ( , )i iconfidence C S p C S= if ( , )ip C S ?> ,
                                       otherwise 0. 
Let: ( , ) 1idf C S = if ( , )ip C S ?> , otherwise 0,

5 Experimental Results 
This section presents experimental results of all 
the three tasks described above. 
5.1 Data
We used 244 videos from TRECVID 2005 data 
set as our test set. This data set includes 133,918 
keyframes, with corresponding automatic 
speech recognition and translation results (for 
foreign languages) provided by LDC.   
5.2 Information Fusion Results 
Table 1 shows information fusion results for 
English, Arabic and Chinese on multiple levels. 
It indicates that video and text extraction pipe-
lines are complementary ? almost all of the 
video concepts are about nominals and events; 
while text extraction output contains a large 
amount of names and relations. Therefore the 
results after information fusion produced much 
richer knowledge.

Table 1. Information Fusion Results  
  It?s also worth noting that the number of con-
cepts extracted from videos is similar across 
languages, while much fewer events are ex-
tracted from Chinese or Arabic because of 
speech recognition and machine translation er-
rors. We took out 1% of the results to measure 
accuracy against ground-truth in TRECVID and 
ACE training data respectively; the mean aver-
age precision for video concept extraction is 
about 33.6%. On English ASR output the text-
IE system achieved about 82.7% F-measure on 
labeling names, 80.5% F-measure on nominals 
(regardless of ASR errors), 66% on relations 
and 64% on events. 
5.3 Information Inference Results 
From the test set, we chose 650 persons (492 
males and 158 females) to evaluate gender dis-
covery. For baselines, we used Google n-gram 
(n=5) corpus Version II including 1.2 billion 5-
grams extracted from about 9.7 billion sentences 
(Lin et al, 2010) and census data including  
5,014 person names with gender information. 
  Since we only have gold-standard gender in-
formation on shot-level (corresponding to a 
snippet in ASR output), we asked a human an-
notator to associate ground-truth with individual 
persons. Table 2 presents overall precision (P), 
recall (R) and F-measure (F).  
Methods P R F 
Google N-gram 89.1% 70.2% 78.5%
Census 96.2% 19.4% 32.4%
Video Extraction 88.9% 73.8% 80.6%
Combined 89.3% 80.4% 84.6%
Table 2.  Gender Discovery Performance 
  Table 2 shows that video extraction based ap-
proach can achieve the highest recall among all 
three methods. The combined approach 
achieved statistically significant improvement 
on recall. 
  Table 3 presents some examples (?F? for fe-
male and ?M? for male). We found that most 
speech name recognition errors are propagated 
to gender detection in the baseline methods, for 
example, ?Sala Zhang? is mis-spelled in speech 
recognition output (the correct spelling should 
be ?Sarah Chang?) and thus Google N-gram 
approach mistakenly predicted it as a male. 
Many rare names such as ?Wu Ficzek?, 
?Karami? cannot be predicted by the baselines,  
  Error analysis on video extraction based ap-
proach showed that most errors occur on those 
shots including multiple people (males and fe-
males). In addition, since the data set is from 
news domain, there were many shots including 
reporters and target persons at the same time. 
For example, ?Jiang Zemin? was mistakenly 
associated with a ?female? gender because the 
reporter is a female in that corresponding shot. 
5.4 Comparable Corpora Acquisition Re-
sults
For comparable corpora acquisition, we meas-
ured accuracy for the top 50 document pairs. 
Due to lack of answer-keys, we asked a bi-
lingual human annotator to judge results manu-
ally. The evaluation guideline generally fol-
lowed the definitions in (Cheung and Fung, 
2004). A pair of documents is judged as compa-
rable if they share a certain amount of informa-
tion (e.g. entities, events and topics). 
Without using IDF, for different parameter ?
and ? in the similarity metrics, the results are 
summarized in Figure 5. For comparison we 
present the results for mono-lingual and cross- 
lingual separately. Figure 5 indicates that as the 
threshold and normalization values increase, the 
accuracy generally improves. It?s not surprising 
that mono-lingual results are better than cross-
lingual results, because generally more videos 
with comparable topics are in the same language.

  We then added IDF to the optimized threshold 
and obtained results in Figure 6. The accuracy 
for both languages was further enhanced. We can 
see that under any conditions our approach can 
discover comparable documents reliably. In or-
der to measure the impact of concept extraction 
errors, we also evaluated the results for using 
ground-truth concepts as shown in Figure 6. Sur-
prisingly it didn?t provide much higher accuracy 
than automatic concept extraction, mainly be-
cause the similarity can be captured by some 
dominant video concepts.

6 Related Work 
A large body of prior work has focused on multi-
media information retrieval and document classi-
fication (e.g. Iria and Magalhaes, 2009).  State-
of-the-art information fusion approaches can be 
divided into two groups: formal ?top-down? 
methods from the generic knowledge fusion 
community and quantitative ?bottom-up? tech-
niques from the Semantic Web community (Ap-
priou et al, 2001; Gregoire, 2006). However, 
very limited research methods have been ex-
636
plored to fuse automatically extracted facts from 
texts and videos/images. Our idea of conducting 
information fusion on multiple semantic levels is 
similar to the kernel method described in (Gu et 
al., 2007). 
  Most previous work on cross-media information 
extraction focused on one single domain (e.g. e-
Government (Amato et al, 2010); soccer game 
(Pazouki and Rahmati, 2009)) and struc-
tured/semi-structured texts (e.g. product cata-
logues (Labsky et al, 2005)). Saggion et al 
(2004) described a multimedia extraction ap-
proach to create composite index from multiple 
and multi-lingual sources. We expand the task to 
the more general news domain including unstruc-
tured texts and use cross-media inference to en-
hance extraction performance. 
  Some recent work has exploited analysis of as-
sociated texts to improve image annotation (e.g. 
Deschacht and Moens, 2007; Feng and Lapata, 
2008). Some recent research demonstrated cross-
modal integration can provide significant gains 
in improving the richness of information. For 
example, Oviatt et al (1997) showed that speech 
and pen-based gestures can provide complemen-
tary capabilities because basic subject, verb, and 
object constituents almost always are spoken, 
whereas those describing locative information 
invariably are written or gestured. However, not 
much work demonstrated an effective method of 
using video/image annotation to improve text 
extraction. Our experiments provide some case 
studies in this new direction. Our work can also 
be considered as an extension of global back-
ground inference (e.g. Ji and Grishman, 2008) to 
cross-media paradigm. 
  Extensive research has been done on video clus-
tering. For example, Cheung and Zakhor (2000)
used meta-data extracted from textual and hyper-
link information to detect similar videos on the 
web; Magalhaes et al (2008) described a seman-
tic similarity metric based on key word vectors 
for multi-media fusion. We extend such video 
similarity computing approaches to a multi-
lingual environment. 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
Traditional Information Extraction (IE) ap-
proaches focused on single media (e.g. texts), 
with very limited use of knowledge from other 
data modalities in the background. In this paper 
we propose a new approach to integrate informa-
tion extracted from videos and texts into a coher-
ent common representation including multi-level 
knowledge (concepts, relations and events). Be-
yond standard information fusion, we attempted 
global inference methods to incorporate video 
extraction and significantly enhanced the per-
formance of text extraction. Finally, we extend 
our methods to multi-lingual environment (Eng-
lish, Arabic and Chinese) by presenting a case 
study on cross-lingual comparable corpora acqui-
sition.
  We used a dataset which includes videos and 
associated speech recognition output (texts), but 
our approach is applicable to any cases in which 
texts and videos appear together (from associated 
texts, captions etc.). The proposed common rep-
resentation will provide a framework for many 
byproducts. For example, the monolingual fused 
information graphs can be used to generate ab-
stractive summaries. Given the fused information 
we can also visualize the facts from background 
texts effectively. We are also interested in using 
video information to discover novel relations and 
events which are missed in the text IE task.
