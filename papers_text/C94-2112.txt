In this paper, we discuss the phenomenon of logical 
polysemy in natural anguage as ~ddressed by Gener- 
ative Lexicon Theory. We discuss generally the role of 
type and sortal coercion operations in the selnantics, 
and specifically the conditions on the application of 
coercion in aspectual predicates and other contexts. 
We reply to some recent discussion regarding the use 
of coercion in the grammar, and show that type chang- 
ing operations are both useful and explanatory mecha- 
nisms for capturing linguistic and computatioiml gcll 
eraliza.tions. 
1 Introduction 
Recently, work in computational semantics and 
lexical semantics has made an interesting shift. 
Motivated by a concern for lexical organization 
and global coherence in tl~e structure of the 
language lexicon, some researchers ha,w~ moved 
towards more expressive semantic descriptions 
(\[16, 1, 5, 101), as well a.s more powerful meth- 
ods of composition (\[22, 3\]). 
Some, however, have expressed reservations a.s 
to the general applicability of type-changing op- 
erations uch as coercion, as well as the notion of 
a generative lexicon itself (\[7\]). In this pa.per, we 
address these c.riticisms directly, and show that, 
upon closer examination of the data, these cri- 
tiques either miss the. point or are not substan 
tiated by the data. Still, without a proper no- 
tion of constraints on coercion, there can indeed 
be overgeneration f forms a.nd interpretations in 
the semantics, and in fact, the notion of con- 
ditions on coercion has always been integral to 
the basic spirit of Generative Lexicon Theory (el'. 
\[19\]). The empirical study of the range and lim- 
its of type change and cocomposition operations 
in natural anguage is an essentia.l part of the re- 
search in formal smnantics. The advantages ac- 
companying elmrative mechanisnls and the char- 
acterization of languages as lmlymorphic in well- 
defined ways far outweight the explanatory in- 
adequacies inherent in traditional approaches to 
lexical design and semantic projection, what \[22\] 
have called word sense enumeration approaches. 
2 Polymorphic Languages and 
Semantic Expressiveness 
We will a, ssulne s(3me geueraJ familiarity with the 
framework of generative lexicon theory, as out- 
lined in \[16, 18, 1\]. ~'e feel it is important,  how- 
ever, to clarify the motivating principles and gen- 
era.l methodology behind SllCh work, since these 
points seem to be overlooked or misunderstood 
by some authors (\[7\]). 
In order to help characterize the generative 
power of natura.l languages in terms of seman- 
tic expressiveness, it is natural to think in terms 
of senla.ntic systenls with increasing functional 
power, l:urthel'more, a nat u ra.I wa.y of Cal)tu ring 
this might be in terms of the type system which 
the gra.mmar efers to for its interl)retation. It 
has been argued elsewhere (\[19, 20\]), that there 
are reasons for describing how semantic systems 
fall on a hierarchy of increasing expressive power. 
It seems clear at this point that the current enu- 
mera.tiw ~.techniques for lexical description are too 
impoverished to adequately describe the richness 
of semantic da.ta, much less to explain either how 
word senses relate to one a.|tother or the creative 
use of wo,'ds i .  ,,over , :o . texts 
llrieily, a. genera.tiw', lexicon can be character- 
ized as a syste.nl involving at least the tbllowing 
four levels of re.presentations: Argument Strut 
1;nre, Event Structul'e, Qnalia. Structnre, and I,ex- 
ical Inheritance Structure. A set of generative de- 
vices connects these \[bur lew~qs, providing lbr the 
compositional interpreta.tioll of words in context. 
The exact nature of these devices will determine 
706 
the polym,m'phic expressiveness of t, he semanLics 
in fa,irly del inite ways. The best st.u(lied i l lustra- 
tion of this is the phenomet,on of ::+\]p++ coc?'cio?+, 
but it, is by no mea.ns the only one.

Namely, the homomorphic rela.tion between the 
NP type (mass vs. count) gives rise to i)rocess 
and transition interpretations of event structures 
(corresponding roughly to the amorl)hous and 
bounded readings resi)ectively, of (k)(lar(\[ and 
aayez's analysis). 
If it is truly an expla.na.tory and productive op- 
eration, coercion should be trot just a property 
of object phr~tses, but affecf the semantic inter-- 
pretation of subjects and other positions a,s well 
(cf. \[17\]). For exan, ple, the interpretation o|' 
psychological predicates uch as ill (5) involves 
a inetonymic reconstruction of the subject as a.n 
e.xperiencing event. 
(5) a. Books bore me. 
b. The movie Mghtened Mary. 
c. Ma.ry's ihce / her chatter / listening to 
l'V\[ary bores nle (cf. \[7\]). 
Contrary to Godard and Ja.yez's claim, all of 
the above examples indicate very clearly a sub- 
ject event reaming; i.e., ~va(ling books, watching 
the movie, seeinq Mary's face, and listening to 
her chatter, as argued in \[J6\]. With examples 
such as *The book bcga'n last week, however, co 
ere|on is not possible for ra.ther trivial reasons; 
nalnely, as a violation o1' control. It is, by tile 
way, not surprising to lind asymmetries between 
argument positions. Anaphora., control, and ex- 
traction from subject position all behave differ- 
ently from argument positions within VP. The 
point is that linguistic evidence supl)orts an un- 
derlying semantic type, directly explaining what 
the connection between the subject and object of 
the experiencing relation is. in \[17}, the un(ler- 
lying semantics of psychological predicates uch 
as bore, anger, and frighten is a causative strue 
lure where the surfa.ee subject is the logical ob- 
ject of an experiencing relation. For example, the 
event structure for the verb an.qcr has tire tbllow- 
ing form: 
\[PTxp(el,x,y) A ~\])(er,y) A ang'ry(e2, y) A 
~e.2-< q\] > cau,se(c'l,c2) 
The qualia structure projected by the NP cow 
tributes relational information as to just wha.t 
manner of experiencing is inw)lved. Short of gen- 
eral world knowledge, how are we to infer the 1)t~r - 
t itular ma.nmu' in which Mary became bored in 
(4b)? By knowing what a. movie is, we know how 
to use it and experience it; this is the defining role 
of tire quaJia structure. And yet, to claim that 
the qualia are a useful representation (which C,o- 
dard a.nd Jayez admit),  withont exploiting them 
through type reconstruction operations (e.g. co 
ercion), is to fail to see the logical relations be~ 
tWeell lexical senses a.nd derived senses in tile lan- 
guage. It is as though we were to i)ermit traces 
ill our granuna.tical formalism without having a. 
statement of binding, or otherwise knowing what 
to do with them. 
The third argu|nent aga.inst (:oercive opera.- 
tions involves exa.mples uch as a long novel and 
a bright bulb. These. are to be contrasted with a 
red book and a,i opaque bulb. As pointed out in 
\[21\], the adjectives here modify a distinguished 
event predicate (i.e. a quale) associated with tile 
head, rcad for book, a~td ilh, min.atc tbr bulb. Go- 
dard a.nd Jayez seenl to think that because the 
NP can apl)ea.r in an environment yped for an 
individual, such as (6)below, 
(fi) .lean a. achet6 un h)ng roman. 
".John hought a long novel." 
tha.t this is a. counterexample to type coercion. 
But this surely misinterprets what role the ad- 
jective is playing in tile semantics. As already 
argued very explicitly in \[22\], the modification by 
an adjective such as long, rclpide (J?tsl), or brillant 
(bright), is a submodification on the al)propriate 
qualia of the head.

The resulting coinlmsitiona\] structure is st i l l  the

ever on selection by an outside governor such as 
acheter (buy) as in (6).

Jayez l)resent against coercion operations in- 
w)lves the apparent lexically idiosyncrati<: na.ture 
of coercion. Why should commencer an<t finir

There is no space to detail the distinction here, 
708 
but it is a i )parent  that  this is (hte to a selnanti( ;  
tyl)e distinction between these classes of pl'edi 
(;ares. 
In what follows, we demonstrate how t, he al)-

begin-predicates actually reveal a much deeper se 
mantle distinction t)etween two logically relate, d

3 The  Semant ics  of  begin 
As argued in Section 2 al>ove, the well-formedt|ess 
of object coml)lement coe+rcion with ast)ectual 
predicates uch as begin is ColMitioned by the 
event sort of the (lualia a.ssociate(1 with the NI ) 
itself. Thus, only Nl)s having associated tra.nsi+ 
tion events will allow coercion a,n(\[ control. This 
is not to sly, howew~r, that bcgi?z selects only for 
transition events. There are, of course, perfectly 
grammatical  examples of prt)cess COm l)lelnents, 
as shown in (8) below: 
(8) a. The snow began to \['all at mi(llfight. 
b. John 1)egan to feel ill. 
c. The W~/l\] ' bega.n to t'each ilttO Bestride. 
These examples il lustrate the use of begin as a 
raising verb. We will follow Perhnutter \[14\], in 
distinguishing between two senses of the. verb be- 
gin, distiuguishal)le not I)y the selectional proper- 
ties given in Codard and .layex. but, rather, con+ 
forming to the distinction that \[1.t\] ula(le; namely, 
~'~S eit\]:ter a Raisi'ng or  a (~'o?~lrol verb .  
The analysis is as folk)ws. There are in(leed 
two grammatical expressions of the verb &:gin, as 
Raising and Sul)ject-(,'outrol forms: As a control 
verb, the event sort specified as tim c(maplement 
iS a TR+ANSI3'ION. As a Raising verb, however, the 
event may be any sort. This tbllows the' typing 
assignments below: 
Cont roh  ((' .... ( r )  _ ( (  _ ( r )  
Rais ing :  (c ? ? t 'r) 
The examples above aud in (9a) and (9b) I>elow 
il lustrate the raising i||terprt~tation (~\[' bcgi~: 
(9) a. The a.cid began to corrode the marble. 
b. It. began ~o rain. 
We will assume that ra.ising is accomplished by 
function composition, in the manner of \[8\]. The 
manner in which Raising is treated a.s func- 
tion composition (FC) is as follows: begin is 
~:* -~ ~'*', to corrode the marble in the exam- 
.ple above is e -+ c t'. Then, b'C(be( j in , VP)  -- 
a?,\[b,:vi,,,'( ,,o,,,,oa,:( ?-,, O...-,..,.q,l~)\]. 
As pointed out irt \[?\], VP ellipsis can be used 
as a diagnostic for determining whether a conq)le- 
ment is l)art of a raising or control construction. 
Some l)redi(:ates permit 1)otl\] a control and non 
c()ntrol reading, such as (10)below, where John 
may I>e intentionaJly (lietitlg or he may be ill. 
(10) .\]ohn began to lose. weight. 
Notice however, that in English the sentence in 
(1 I) has only t.he intentional inclloative reading, 
aim not the raising version. 
(11) JohI| began tolose weight, and Mary began 
tot).  
What this illdicat(,s is that there are indeed two 
coJlstru(:tioJts at play here, as teased apart I)y cer-

We have argued that there are, two senses of the 
verb bc(li?~, cor|'espondit|g to raising a.ud control 
predicates. These senses, howe, ver, are not arbi- 
trary t;ypes but are logically related t,o one an 
other in the same way that tile diffe|'ent senses of 
una.ccusa.tive/causative verbs, such as break, and 
s ink are. related. In \[23\] it is shown titat verbs 
such as .~i~k and a./.fonda'rc are logically polyse- 
mous in predictabh~ ways, and don't need to be 
assigned multiple texical entries. The same geu 
eralization hohls for verl) such as begil~: begirt, is 
the lexical version of a,n u naccusative marker, 1)ut

the qualia can be seen as partial fimctions, re- 
turning the value of a particular quale for a.u NP. 
The combined set of quaiia provide a set of type 
aliases for tile expression contaiuing them (of. 
\[18\]). One particular mechanism, type pumping, 
has been explored as a means to generating the 
alias set (\[20\]). 
l,et G be the typing judgements with respect 
to a grammar. Then, by convention, C I- ~, : r 
represents a type assignment of r to the expres- 
sion ?~.1 Thus for example, the type a.wdlable to 
an expression o' with quale Qi of type r,  can be 
see,) as the following type inference: 2 
G' k-L* : or, G'~-Qi \ [~r , r \ ] :a~r  
(i' t- Qi\[cr, r\]((t) : r 
This says that,  given an expression a' of type 
(r, there is a coercion l)ossible between (r and r, 
which changes the type of a' in this composition, 
from (* to r. We will illustra.te tile further a.1)pli- 
cation of this coercion ol)eration below, as used in 
the begin examples. \[n (13a), we see how the a.s- 
pectual verb commencer selects tile COm l>lenmnt 
VP, and how in (:lab), an NP is coerced into an 
event interpretation.

Following \[2()\], we can view tile l)a.sic COml)osi- 
tion of the sentence in (13a.) as type inference in 
Figure 1.

type inference within the A-cah:ulus, and \[10, 2\], aim 
\[22, 19\] for its application to lexical ,'el)resentation.

For the deriva.tion of (131)), coercion applies to 
the corn plement N \] ), resulting in the a.l)propriate 
type selected by the verb, as illustra.ted below ill 
Figure 2 )  
In the case of b(;gin with NP co)nplements such 
as the symphony or lhe molorway, the <:oercion is 
not possible, given the type misma.tch in the in- 
tended qualia relation (i.e. li.stcning and driving 
are PROC\],~SS evelH;S). Notice, however, since the 
AGI~;NTIV\],', for each has all evellt  of  sort  TRANSI- 
TION, these ;q.Fe possible coercive interpretations; 
i.e. perform the symphony, or build the highway. 
Notice that one might expect there to l)e rais- 
ing constructious involving coerced NP com\])le- 
ments. But these do not exist:, as the ungram- 
maticality o\[' *John &tan his ~ap (non-control 
reading) illustra.tes. This ix due to the fact that 
coercion is governed by the type of the controller, 
in this case C' type c~ ~ ('c. This coercion will 
be successful if suc}l a type exists in the alia.s set 
of the complemellt. Since function composition 
is an ol)eratiou at. the level o\[' the VP, there is no 
point iu the deriva.tiou such that the. api)ropria.te 
type is availal)le \['or the rule to apply. 
As a filial ol)servation, it should be ol)vious now 
why verbs such as enjoy allow a nluch I)roader 
range of complement coercious (of. \[16\] for (h>
