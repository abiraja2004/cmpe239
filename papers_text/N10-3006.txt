Abstract 
When humans communicate via natural lan-
guage, they frequently make use of metalan-
guage to clarify what they mean and promote 
a felicitous exchange of ideas. One key aspect 
of metalanguage is the mention of words and 
phrases, as distinguished from their use. This 
paper presents ongoing work on identifying 
and categorizing instances of language-
mention, with the goal of building a system 
capable of automatic recognition of the phe-
nomenon. A definition of language-mention 
and a corpus of instances gathered from Wiki-
pedia are discussed, and the future direction of 
the project is described. 
1 Introduction 
Costello: Well then who's on first? 
Abbott: Yes. 
Costello: I mean the fellow's name. 
Abbott: Who. 
Costello: The guy on first. 
Abbott: Who. 
 
 In Abbott and Costello?s famous routine 
?Who?s on First??, Costello asks Abbott for the 
names of the players on a baseball team. In the 
above excerpt1, Abbott tries unsuccessfully to ex-
plain that the name of the first baseman is Who, but 
Costello interprets this as another question instead

of a response to his own. If Abbott had been more 
explicit and less terse (by responding with ?The 
fellow?s name is the word ?Who??, for instance), 
he would have avoided the ambiguity in his an-
swers and might have succeeded in conveying to 
Costello the name of the first baseman. Instead, 
this misunderstanding is repeated throughout the 
routine with comic results, as the two become in-
creasingly agitated by their breakdown in commu-
nication. 
 As Abbott and Costello unwittingly demon-
strated, we sometimes must refer to the language 
that we speak and write in order to understand lan-
guage itself. Metalanguage is our facility for doing 
this, and its interpretation often implicitly relies on 
the use-mention distinction?that is, simply, the 
distinction between using elements of language 
and mentioning them. In both written and spoken 
communication, the mention of letters, sounds, 
words, phrases, or entire sentences (termed lan-
guage-mention in this paper for brevity) is essen-
tial for indicating titles, explaining meaning, 
introducing new words, attributing exact utterances 
to others, and other common functions of metalan-
guage (Saka 2005). There is evidence that human 
conversation makes frequent use of the use-
mention distinction, and that we would be severely 
handicapped without it (Perlis et al, 1998). More-
over, this distinction has close ties to the appear-
ance-reality distinction in cognitive science (Miller 
1993). 
 It is surprising, then, that the use-mention dis-
tinction has thus far received little attention in 
computational linguistics. The need for greater 
study is unmistakable, as human audiences gener-
29
ally navigate through this linguistic phenomenon 
with a natural ease that computers do not possess. 
The complexity behind this natural ease is apparent 
in our ability to understand simple sentences such 
as ?Sky is spelled S K Y? and ?The letters S, K, 
and Y make the word sky?, which mean essentially 
the same thing but are structured and worded very 
differently. To gain the benefits of understanding 
the use-mention distinction, natural language 
processing systems must detect the subtle cues that 
signal this phenomenon. 
This paper presents some preliminary results 
from a project on characterizing and identifying 
instances of language-mention in the English lan-
guage. The use-mention distinction is first ex-
plained in greater detail, and a working definition 
is proposed for the phenomenon of language-
mention. A corpus of instances of language-
mention from Wikipedia is then introduced, with 
analysis of the categories in which the phenome-
non appears to occur. The hypothesis of this con-
tinuing project is that lexical and syntactic cues 
will be sufficient to automatically identify at least a 
large subset of instances of mentioned language. 
2 The Use-Mention Distinction  
The use-mention distinction, as previously stated, 
is the distinction between using linguistic entities 
(such as letters, sounds, words, phrases, or entire 
sentences) and mentioning them. Since this expla-
nation is slightly opaque at best and possibly circu-
lar, some examples and a proposal for a definition 
are appropriate. Consider the following sentences: 
(1) The cat is on the mat. 
(2) The word ?cat? is spelled with three letters. 
In (1), the reader?s attention to meaning does not 
focus on the words themselves, but instead upon 
the presumed cat on the mat. In (2), the reader un-
derstands that the word cat?a string of three let-
ters, as opposed to any particular cat or an abstract 
idea of a cat?is in the focus of the sentence. Quo-
tation marks around cat in (2) are a convention to 
further reinforce that the word is being mentioned, 
and in some contexts (such as this sentence) italics 
may serve the same purpose. 
 The other linguistic entities listed above can also 
be mentioned, and the reader may easily conjure 
appropriate examples. Of particular note is quota-
tion, a form of language-mention in which lan-
guage from another source is reproduced as part of 
a statement, as in (3) below: 
(3) Eric said, ?We should meet for lunch.? 
In (3), the phrase between quote marks is men-
tioned as what Eric has said. However, the reader 
is likely to treat the quoted text in (3) as a string 
with semantic depth, indicating that the use half of 
the use-mention distinction is present as well. Ex-
amples such as this illustrate that use and mention 
are not mutually exclusive (Maier 2007). 
 If writers always and consistently used cues 
such as quotation marks and italics, and if speakers 
followed a convention for delimiting mentioned 
utterances2, recognizing language-mention would 
be an easier task. However, it frequently falls upon 
the intuition of the audience to determine when, 
where, and how it occurs (Anderson et al 2002). 
Sentences (2) and (3) above, if typed less formally 
(sans quotation marks) or transcribed from speech, 
would still be easily understood by a human read-
er. Moreover, cues such as italics and quotation 
marks are also used for other purposes, such as 
distancing (?scare quotes?) and emphasis, meaning 
that they are uncertain indicators of language-
mention. It seems that subtler cues are responsible 
for our ability to distinguish use and mention. 
 In spite of the ubiquity of the phrase use-
mention distinction, it is difficult to find an explicit 
definition for either the distinction itself or its two 
halves. The effort here will be to define language-
mention, since this will aid in identifying where 
and how it occurs. What follows is a working defi-
nition, in the sense that it is a ?rough draft?; sug-
gestions for improvement are invited. For the 
moment, it restricts the scope of this work to sen-
tential language-mention, where the mentioned 
linguistic entity is referred to inside of the same 
sentence that it occurs. (An example of a sentence 
that fails this additional requirement is: ?Disregard 
the last thing I said.?) This restriction is necessary 
to reduce the complexity of the identification and 
labeling problems, and it will be assumed for the 
rest of the paper. 
Definition: For T a token or a set of tokens in a 
sentence, if T refers to a property of the token T or 
the type of T, then T is an instance of language-
mention.

 One might observe that spoken language sometimes contains 
nonverbal cues for language-mention. While worthy of study, 
these cues fall beyond the scope of this paper, which will fo-
cus on written or transcribed language. 
30
Here, a token can be any one of the linguistic enti-
ties listed at the beginning of this section?letters, 
sounds, words, phrases, or entire sentences.  A 
property might be its spelling, pronunciation, orig-
inal source (in the case of quotation), meaning (for 
a variety of interpretations of that term), or another 
aspect for which language is shown or demonstrat-
ed3. The type of T is relevant in some instances of 
language-mention (such as in (2)) and the token 
itself is relevant in others (including unusual cases 
such as ?The is the first word in this sentence?). 
3 A Language-Mention Corpus 
The second task of this project has been to create a 
corpus of sentences that contain instances of lan-
guage-mention. The corpus will be valuable to 
move beyond laboratory examples and to begin 
mining for patterns in syntax and vocabulary that 
predict the occurrence of the phenomenon. 
 Wikipedia was chosen as a source of text for 
several reasons. Its text is freely available and cov-
ers a wide variety of subjects. Articles are written 
to be informative, which suggests that new names 
and terms are introduced frequently?a common 
function of language-mention. Contributors tend to 
highlight language-mention with italicization, bold 
text, or quotation marks. (This convention is men-
tioned in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, though it 
is unclear whether most contributors read it there 
or simply follow it out of habit.) While language-
mention can certainly occur outside of those stylis-
tic cues, the decision was made to concentrate on 
sentences that contained them, since this greatly 
accelerated the annotation process. 
 The annotation effort focused on the markup 
text of 1000 randomly chosen articles from English 
Wikipedia. Except for delimiters for bold and italic 
text, most of the markup was removed, and the 
remaining text was segmented into sentences using 
NLTK?s implementation of the Punkt sentence 
tokenizer (Kiss and Strunk, 2006). The sentences 
then were filtered for only those that contained 
bold text, italic text, or text between single or 
double quotation marks, yielding a set of 1339 sen-
tences that contained one or more of them. 
 Hand annotation required approximately three 
person-hours, with that time heavily skewed to-
ward approximately the first third of the sentences, 
                                                          
3
 These properties are based upon the ostentions of language 
in Paul Saka?s treatment of the use-mention distinction (1998). 
as the set of categories for language-mention was 
also developed during this labeling process. Cate-
gories were formed with an informal "diagnostic 
test" of substitution of the category's theme (e.g., 
"this proper name", "this translation", "this sym-
bol", "this quotation") in the place of the candidate 
token or tokens. Only text highlighted by one of 
the cues mentioned above was considered for labe-
ling. Although only one researcher participated in 
the annotation, at the time of writing this paper an 
effort was in progress to build a much larger cor-
pus using multiple annotators via Amazon?s Me-
chanical Turk service. This service has shown 
promise in other natural language annotation tasks 
(Snow et al, 2008). 
 Out of the 1339 sentences inspected by hand, 
171 contained at least one instance of language-
mention. Many of those sentences contained sever-
al instances. Table 1 below lists the categories ob-
served and the frequencies of each one, and Table 
2 provides examples from each category.

Cat. Example 
PN In 2005, Ashley Page created another short 
piece on Scottish Ballet, a strikingly mod-
ern piece called ''The Pump Room'', set to 
pulsating music by Aphex Twin. 
TR The Latin title translates as ''a method for 
finding curved lines enjoying properties of 
maximum or minimum, or solution of iso-
perimetric problems in the broadest ac-
cepted sense''. 
AT "It is still fresh in my memory that I read a 
chess book of Karpov by chance in 1985 
which I liked very much," the 21-year-old 
said. 
WD '''Submerged forest''' is a term used to de-
scribe the remains of trees (especially tree 
31
stumps) which have been submerged by 
marine transgression, i.e. sea level rise. 
SY He also introduced the modern notation 
for the trigonometric functions, the letter 
''e'' for the base of the natural logarithm 
(now also known as Euler's number) ? 
PH The call of this species is a high pitched 
''ke-ke-ke'' like American Kestrel. 
SP '''James Breckenridge Speed''' (middle 
name sometimes spelled '''Breckinridge''') 
(1844-1912) was a successful businessman 
in Louisville, Kentucky and an important 
philanthropist. 
AB ? ''Moskovskiy gosudarstvennyy univer-
sitet putej soobshcheniya'', often abbre-
viated '''MIIT''' for '''Moscow Institute of 
Transport Engineers''' ? 
 
Table 2: Examples from the corpus of each category of 
language-mention. Triple quote marks indicate bold text 
in the original markup. The longer sentences for SY and 
AB have been truncated. The relevant instance of lan-
guage-mention in each example appears underlined. 
 
As shown, proper names were by far the most 
common category, with almost twice as many in-
stances as the next most frequent category.  This 
follows intuition, since Wikipedia articles often 
describe entities identified by proper names. In 
contrast, there were just a few instances of pronun-
ciation (phonetic/sound) or spelling. Either the pre-
filtering of sentences eliminated many instances of 
these before human annotation could find them, or 
Wikipedia is not a fertile source for them. 
Of particular note are the 46 instances of words 
or phrases as themselves, since these are examples 
of language being either introduced or clarified for 
the reader. While there exists a body of work on 
named entity recognition (Nadeau and Sekine, 
2007), very little exists on identifying when words 
serve a very similar function, essentially as rigid 
designators for their types.  One of the future goals 
of this project will be to fill that gap. 
4 Related Work 
A similar corpus-building project was undertaken 
by Anderson, et. al (2004) to study the occurrence 
of metalanguage in human dialogue. In addition to 
the difference in focus (metalanguage broadly ver-
sus language-mention in particular), their project 
concentrated on the classification of utterances 
from casual speech, as opposed to the structure of 
well-formed sentences. The automatic recognition 
of language-mention will require a specific focus 
on the phenomenon, since it differs from other 
forms of metalanguage in its unusual syntactic 
structure (as shown in the next section). 
 In applications, the use-mention distinction has 
also received some treatment within dialog man-
agement and commonsense reasoning, as imple-
mented in the ALFRED system (Josyula et al, 
2003). However, its ability to recognize language-
mention is limited to the task of learning new 
words from a limited set of sentence structures. 
The ongoing project described in this paper instead 
has the goal of recognizing and eventually inter-
preting language-mention in a wide variety of nat-
ural cases. 
5 Future Work 
The next step in this project will be to enlarge the 
language-mention corpus, using more data from 
Wikipedia and other promising sources. Language 
learning materials have also been considered for 
this purpose, as they necessarily contain a high 
frequency of metalanguage. The presence of stylis-
tic cues in the text will be useful but perhaps not 
essential, as it is anticipated that bootstrapping the 
annotation process will become possible once 
enough indicators in sentence structure and voca-
bulary have been identified. This identification will 
be accomplished through a combination of eyebal-
ling of patterns in parse trees and automated 
searching through the corpus using a tool such as 
Tregex (Levy and Andrew, 2006). 
 One eventual goal of this project is to detect 
language-mention without the presence of stylistic 
cues, with the intent of correcting egregious errors 
common in syntactic parsing of the phenomenon. 
Statistically-trained parsers have achieved great 
levels of accuracy at the macro level of examining 
large quantities of text, but this comes at a cost. 
Such accuracy tends not to include the phenome-
non of language-mention, which often has an un-
usual structure. Consider the following two 
sentences paired with the resulting output from the 
Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning 2003): 
(4a) Car is spelled c a r 
32
(4b) (ROOT (S (NP (NNP Car)) (VP (VBZ is) 
(VP (VBN spelled) (S (NP (SYM c)) (NP (DT 
a) (NN r))))))) 
(5a) The pronunciation of potato is pough tayh 
toe 
(5b) (ROOT (S (NP (NP (DT The) (NN pro-
nunciation)) (PP (IN of) (NP (NN potato)))) 
(VP (VBZ is) (NP (JJ pough) (NN tayh) (NN 
toe))))) 
Both of these sentences are easily interpretable 
by a human audience, but the parser garbles their 
structure where language-mention occurs. Such 
unusual structure and vocabulary are likely not to 
lend well to the methods used to train such a pars-
er. Because of this, the feasibility of a ?hybrid? 
system is being investigated, which would com-
bine an existing high-performance parser with a 
rule-based system to modify and correct its output 
where appropriate. 
Preliminary work on a language-mention parser 
has shown the feasibility of this hybrid approach. 
A trial system has been built that uses parse trees 
produced by the Stanford Parser as input to five 
rules that detect common syntactic patterns indicat-
ing the phenomenon occurs in a sentence. In (4a), 
for instance, the presence of the verb spell and the 
sequence of two or more single-letter words indi-
cates that the sequence is likely an instance of lan-
guage-mention and falls into the category of 
spelling. Although language-mention exhibits sub-
stantial variety in its forms (and certainly will not 
be conquered by the five rules in the trial system), 
this approach should be able to take advantage of 
additional patterns mined from the corpus of the 
phenomenon currently being created.  It is hy-
pothesized that such a parser, using lexical and 
syntactic cues, will be sufficient to identify and 
categorize a large percentage of instances of lan-
guage-mention in the absence of any stylistic cues.
