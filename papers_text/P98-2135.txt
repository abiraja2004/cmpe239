Abstract 
This paper describes the design and application of 
time-enhanced, finite state models of discourse 
cues to the automated segmentation of broadcast 
news. We describe our analysis of a broadcast 
news corpus, the design of a discourse cue based 
story segmentor that builds upon information 
extraction techniques, and finally its computational 
implementation a d evaluation in the Broadcast 
News Navigator (BNN) to support video news 
browsing, retrieval, and summarization. 
1. Introduction 
Large video collections require content-based 
information browsing, retrieval, extraction, and 
summarization to ensure their value for tasks such 
as real-time profiling and retrospective search. 
Whereas image processing for video indexing 
currently provides low level indec~s uch as visual 
transitions and shot classification (Zhang et al 
1994), some research has investigated the use of 
linguistic streams (e.g., closed captions, transcripts) 
to provide keyword-based indexes to video. Story- 
based segmentation remains illusive. For example, 
traditional text tiling approaches often 
undersegment broadcast news because of rapid 
topic shifts (Mani et al 1997). This paper takes a 
corpus-based approach to this problem, building 
linguistic models based on an analysis of a digital 
collection of broadcast news, exploiting the 
regularity utilized by humans in signaling topic 
shifts to detect story segments. 
2. Broadcast News Analysis 
Human communication is characterized by distinct 
discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) which 
is used for a variety of purposes including 
managing interaction between participants, 
mitigating limited attention, and signaling topic 
shifts. In processing enre such as technical or 
journalistic texts, programs can take advantage of 
explicit discourse cues (e.g., "the first", "the most 
important") to perform tasks such as summarization 
(Paice 1981). Our initial inability to segment topics 
in closed caption news text using thesaurus based 
subject assessments (Liddy and Myaeng 1992) 
motivated an investigation of explicit turn taking 
signals (e.g., anchor to reporter handoff). We 
analyzed programs (e.g., CNN PrimeNews) from an 
over one year corpus of closed caption texts with the 
intention of creating models of discourse and other 
cues for segmentation.

Figure 1. Closed Caption Challenges 
(CNN Prime News, August 17, 1997) 
While human captioners employ standard cues to 
signal discourse shifts in the closed caption stream 
(e.g., ">>" is used to signal a speaker shift whereas 
">>>" signals a subject change), these can be 
erroneous, incomplete, or inconsistent. Figure 1 
illustrates a typical excerpt from our corpus. Our 
creation of a gold standard corpus of a variety of 
broadcast sources indicates that transcription word 
error rates range from 2% for pre-recorded programs 
such as 60 Minutes news magazine to 20% for live 
transcriptions (including errors of insertion, 
deletion, and transposition). This noisy data 
complicates robust story segmentation.

2.1 News Story Discourse Structure 
Broadcast news has a prevalent structure with often 
explicit cues to signal story shifts. For example, 
analysis of the structure of ABC World News 
Tonight indicates: 
? broadcasts start and end with the anchor  
? reporter segments are preceded by an introductory 
anchor segment and together they form a single story 
? commercials serve as story boundaries 
Similar but unique structure is also prevalent in 
many other news programs uch as CNN Prime 
News (See Figure 1) or MS-NBC. For example, 
the structure for the Jim Lehrer News Hour 
provides not only segmentation i formation but 
also content information for each segment. Thus, 
the order of stories is consistently: 
? preview of major stories of the day or in the broadcast 
program 
? sponsor messages 
? summary of the day's news 
(including some major stories) 
? four to six major stories 
? recap summary of the day's news 
? sponsor messages 
Recovering this structure would enable a user to 
view the four minute opening summary, retrieve 
daily news summaries, preview and retrieve major 
stories, or browse a video table of contents, with or 
without commercials. 
2.2 Discourse Cues and Named Entities 
Manual and semi-automated analysis of our news 
corpora reveals that regular cues are used to signal 
these shifts in discourse, although this structure 
varies dramatically from source to source. For 
example, CNN discourse cues can be classified into 
the following categories (examples from 8/18/97): 
? Start of Broadcast 
"GOOD EVENING, I 'M KATHLEEN KENNEDY, S ITT ING 
IN FOR JOIE CHEN. " 
? Anchor-to-Reporter Handoff 
"WE'RE JO INED BY CNN'S CHARLES ZEWE IN NEW 
ORLEANS. CHARLES? 
? Reporter-to-Anchor Handoff 
"CHARLES ZEWE, CNN, NEW ORLEANS" 
? Cataphoric Segment 
"STILL  AHEAD ON PRIMENEWS" 
? Broadcast End 
"THAT WRAPS UP THIS MONDAY EDIT ION OF 
"PRIMENEWS"" 
The regularity o f  these discourse cues from 
broadcast to broadcast provides an effective 
foundat ion for discourse-based segmentat ion 
routines. We have similarly d iscovered regular 
discourse cues in other news programs. For 
example,  anchor/reporter and reporter/anchor 
handoffs  in CNN Pr ime News or ABC News and 
other network programs are identif ied through 
pattern matching o f  strings such as: 
? (word) (word) ", ABC NEWS" 
? "ABC'S CORRESPONDENT'' (word) (word) 
The pairs of words in parentheses correspond to the 
reporter's first and last names. Combining the 
handoffs with structural cues, such as knowing that 
the first and last speaker in the program will be the 
anchor, allow us differentiate anchor segments from 
reporter segments. By preprocessing the closed 
caption text with a part of speech tagger and named 
entity detector (Aberdeen et al 1995) retrained on 
closed captions, we generalize search of text strings 
to the following class of patterns: 
* (proper name) ", ABC NEWS" 
? "ABC'S CORRESPONDENT'" (proper name) 
3. Computational Implementation 
Our discourse cue story segmentor has been 
implemented in the context of a multimedia (closed 
captioned text, audio, video) analysis system for 
web based broadcast news navigation. We employ a 
finite state machine to represent discourse states 
such as an anchor, reporter, or advertisting segment 
(See Figure 2). We further enhance these with 
multimedia cues (e.g. detected Silence, black or logo 
keyframes) and temporal knowledge (indicated as 
time in Figure 2). For example, from statistical 
analysis of CNN Prime News Programs, we know 
that weather segments appear on average 18 minutes 
after the start of the news.

After segmentation, the user is presented with a 
hierarchical navigation space of the news which 
enables earch and retrieval of segmented stories or 
browsing stories by date, topic, named entity or 
keyword (see Figure 3). This is MITRE's 
Broadcast News Navigator 
(http://www.mitre.org/resources/centers/ 
advanced_info/g04f/bnn/mmhomeext.html). 
Named Ent~t~es byType Captions Story Summary 
Figure 3. Broadcast News Navigator 
We leverage the story segments and extracted 
named entities to select he sentence with the most 
named entities to serve as a single sentence 
summary of a given segment. Story structure is 
also useful for multimedia summarization. For 
example, we can select key frames or key words 
from the substructure which will likely contain the 
most meaningful content (e.g., an reporter segment 
within an anchor segment). 
4. Evaluation 
We evaluated segmentor performance by measuring 
both the precision and recall of segment boundaries 
compared to manual annotation of story boundaries 
where: 
1. Precision - # of correct segment tags 
# of total segment tags 
2. Recall = # of correct segment tags 
# of hand tags

Table 1. Segmentation Performance 
Table 1 presents average precision and recall results 
for multiple programs after applying eneralized cue 
patterns developed first for ABC as described in 
Section 2.2. Recall degrades when porting these 
same algorithms to different news programs (e.g., 
CNN, Jim Lehrer) given the genre differences as 
described in Section 2.1. 
Errors in story boundary detection include 
erroneously splitting a single story segment into two 
story segments, and merging two contiguous tory 
segments into a single story segment. Furthermore, 
given our error-driven transformation based proper 
name taggers operate at approximately 80% 
precision and recall, this can adversely impact 
discourse cue detections. Also, our preliminary 
evaluation of speech transcription results in word 
error rates of approximately 50%, which suggest 
non captioned text is not yet feasible for this class of 
segmentation. 
We have just completed an empirical study (Merlino 
and Maybury, forthcoming) with BNN users that 
explores the optimal mixture of media elements 
show in Figure 3 (e.g., keyframes, named entities, 
topics) in terms of speed and accuracy of story 
identification and comprehension tasks. Key 
findings include that users perform better and prefer 
mixed media presentations over just one media (e.g., 
named entities or topic lists), and they are quicker 
and more accurate working from extracts and 
summaries than from the source transcript or video.

6. Conclusion and Future Work 
We have described and evaluated a news story 
segmentation algorithm that detects news discourse 
structure using discourse cue, s that exploit fixed 
expressions and transformational-based, part of 
speech and named entity taggers created using 
error-driven learning. The implementation utilizes 
a time-enhanced finite state automata that 
represents discourse states and their expected 
temporal occurance in a news broadcast based on 
statistical analysis of the corpus. This provides an 
important mechanism to enable topic tracking, 
indeed we take the text from each segment an run 
this through a commercial topic identification 
rouUne an provide the user with a list of the top 
classes associated with each story (See Figure 3). 
The segmentor has been integrated into a system 
(BNN) for content-based news access and has been 
deployed in a corporate intranet and is currently 
being evaluated for deployment in the US 
government and a national broadcasting 
corporation. 
We have improved segmentation performance by 
exploiting cues in audio and visual streams (e.g., 
speaker shifts, scene changes) (Maybury et al 
1997). To obtain a better indication of annotator 
reliability and for comparative evaluation, we need 
to measure interannotator agreement. Future 
research includes investigating the relationship of 
other linguistic properties, such as co-reference, 
intonation contours, and lexical semantics 
coherence to serve as a measure of cohesion that 
might further support story segmentation. Finally, 
we are currently evaluating in user studies which 
mix of media elements (e.g., key frame, named 
entities, key sentence) are most effective in 
presenting story segments for different information 
seeking tasks (e.g., story identification, 
comprehension, correlation).
