Abstract 
Native language identification (NLI) is the 
task to determine the native language of the 
author based on an essay written in a second 
language.  NLI is often treated as a classifica-
tion problem.  In this paper, we use the 
TOEFL11 data set which consists of more 
data, in terms of the amount of essays and 
languages, and less biased across prompts, i.e., 
topics, of essays.  We demonstrate that even 
using word level n-grams as features, and sup-
port vector machine (SVM) as a classifier can 
yield nearly 80% accuracy. We observe that 
the accuracy of a binary-based word level n-
gram representation (~80%) is much better 
than the performance of a frequency-based 
word level n-gram representation (~20%).  
Notably, comparable results can be achieved 
without removing punctuation marks, suggest-
ing a very simple baseline system for NLI. 
1 Introduction 
Native language identification (NLI) is an emerg-
ing field in the natural language processing com-
munity and machine learning community (Koppel 
et al, 2005; Blanchard et al, 2013). It is a task to 
identify the native language (L1) of an author 
based on his/her texts written in a second language.  
The application of NLI can bring many benefits, 
such as providing a learner adaptive feedback of 
their writing errors based on the native language 
for educational purposes (Koppel et al, 2005; 
Blanchard et al, 2013).  
NLI can be viewed as a classification problem.  
In a classification problem, a classifier is first 
trained using a set of training examples.  Each 
training example is represented as a set of features, 
along with a class label.  After a classifier is 
trained, the classifier is evaluated using a testing 
set (Murphy, 2012). Good data representation often 
yields a better classification performance (Murphy, 
2012).  Often time, the simpler representations 
might produce better performance.  In this work, 
we demonstrate that a binary-based word level n-
gram representation yields much better perform-
ance than a frequency-based word level n-gram 
representation.  In addition, we observed that re-
moving punctuation marks in an essay does not 
make too much difference in a classification per-
formance. 
The contributions of this paper are to demon-
strate the usefulness of a binary-based word level 
n-gram representation, and a very simple baseline 
system without the need of removing punctuation 
marks and stop words. 
This paper is organized as the following.  In 
Section 2, we present related literatures.  
TOEFL11 data set is introduced in Section 3.  In 
Section 4, our features and system design are de-
scribed.  The results are presented in Section 5, 
followed by conclusion in Section 6.

2 Related Work 
The work by Koppel et al (2005) is the first study 
to investigate native language identification.  They 
use the International Corpus of Learner English 
(ICLE).  They set up this task as a classification 
problem studied in machine learning community.  
They use three types of features: function words, 
character n-gram, errors and idiosyncrasies, e.g. 
spelling and grammatical errors.   For errors and 
idiosyncrasies, they used Microsoft Office Word to 
detect those errors.  Their features were evaluated 
on a subset of the ICLE corpus, including essays 
sampled from five native languages (Russian, 
Czech, Bulgarian, French and Spanish) with 10-
fold cross validation.  They achieve an accuracy of 
80.2% by combining all of the features and using a 
support vector machine as the classification algo-
rithm. In addition, Tsur and Rappoport (2007) 
show that using character n-gram only on the ICLE 
can yield an accuracy of 66%.   
The work from Kochmar (2011) identifies an 
author?s native language using error analysis.  She 
suggests that writers with different native lan-
guages generate different grammatical error pat-
terns. Instead of using ICLE, this work uses a 
different corpus, English learner essays from the 
Cambridge Learner Corpus. She uses SVM on 
manually annotated spelling and grammatical er-
rors along with lexical features. 
Most of the systems described in NLI literature 
reach good performance in predicting an author?s 
native language, using character n-gram and part of 
speech n-gram as features (Blanchard et al, 2013).  
In recent years, various studies have started to look 
into complex features in order to improve the per-
formance.  Wong and Dras (2009) use contrastive 
analysis, a systematic analysis of structural simi-
larities and differences in a pair of languages.  A 
writer?s native language influences the target lan-
guage they aim to learn. They explore the impact 
of three English as Second Language (ESL) error 
types, subject-verb disagreement, noun-number 
disagreement and determiner errors, and use a sub-
set of ICLE with 7 languages.   However, although 
the determiner error feature seems useful, when it 
is combined with a baseline model of lexical fea-
tures, the classification performance is not signifi-
cantly improved (Wong and Dras, 2009). 
Wong and Dras (2011) use complex features 
such as production rules from two parsers and 
reranking features into the classification frame-
work, incorporating lexical features of Koppel et al 
(2005).  They achieve a classification performance 
of 81.71% on the 7-native-languages NLI, slightly 
better than 80.2% accuracy of the original Koppel 
et al (2005). 
Note that although the International Corpus of 
Learner English (ICLE) is used in most of the NLI 
studies, ICLE has been known to have fewer es-
says, and a skewed distribution toward topics of 
essays (Blanchard et al, 2013).  In addition, even 
though there are 16 native languages in ICLE, as 
each language has different numbers of essays, 
most work often uses different subsets of 7 native 
languages, which makes comparison harder across 
different studies (Blanchard et al, 2013). The NLI 
shared task 2013 provides a new data set, namely 
the TOEFL11 (Blanchard et al, 2013), which ad-
dresses these issues.  As previously discussed, 
complex features do not necessarily improve clas-
sification accuracy.  In this work, we use 
TOEFL11 to investigate the classification per-
formance using simple word n-gram based features.  
3 Data  
In this work, we use TOEFL11 as our corpus.  
TOEFL11 is a new data set for NLI (Blanchard et 
al., 2013). There are 11 native languages, including 
Arabic (ARA), Chinese (CHI), French (French), 
German (GER), Hindi (HIN), Italian (ITA), Japa-
nese (JPN), Korean (KOR), Spanish (SPA), Telugu 
(TEL), and Turkish (TUR).  Authors write essays 
based on 8 different topics in English.  There are 
1,100 essays for each language, and sampled from 
8 different topics, i.e., prompts.    Each essay is 
also annotated with an English proficiency level 
(low/medium/high) determined by assessment spe-
cialists.  Among 12,100 essays, there are 9,900 
essays in the training set, 1,100 essays in the de-
velopment set, i.e., validation set in machine learn-
ing, and 1,100 essays in the testing set.  In the 
training set and the development set, there are 
equal numbers of essays from each of the 11 native 
languages. By using TOEFL11, it makes our 
analysis less biased toward a specific topic of es-
says (Blanchard et al, 2013).

4 NIL System Design 
In this section, we describe our NLI system, the 
features, and the classifier we use. 
4.1 Data Preprocessing 
Each essay is tokenized, and then capitalizations 
are removed.  Note that we did not remove English 
stop words, which might be useful to discriminate 
the native language for a writer.  For example, 
function words, which belong to stop words, such 
as ?the?, ?at?, ?which?, have been proven to be ef-
fective to distinguish native language for writers 
(Koppel et al, 2005).  There are two settings: ei-
ther punctuation marks are removed or kept.   
When punctuation marks are kept, they are viewed 
the same as word in constructing n-grams.  For 
example, in the sentence ?NLI is fun.?, ?fun .? is 
viewed as a bigram. 
4.2 Features 
In our system, word level n-grams are used to rep-
resent an essay.  Previous studies have shown that 
word level n-grams are useful in determining the 
native language of a writer (Bykh and Meurers, 
2012).  One reasonable hypothesis is that non-
native English writers with the same native lan-
guages tend to choose more similar words to ex-
press the same or similar concepts.  In addition, the 
combination of a sequence of words might also be 
affected by the different native language of writers.  
Therefore, word n-gram is useful to distinguish the 
native language of a writer.  Even though some 
previous studies have looked into using word level 
n-grams as features, how to use word level n-
grams has not been explored too much yet on 
TOEFL11 corpus.  To our knowledge, the most 
recent study by Blanchard et al (2013) started to 
research the effect of different forms of word level 
n-gram representations. 
There could be many ways to represent an essay 
by word level n-grams.  One possible representa-
tion of an essay is to use the frequency of a spe-
cific word n-gram, i.e., the number of times a 
specific word n-gram appears in an essay divided 
by the number of times all word n-grams appear in 
an essay.  In this representation, an essay is a vec-
tor whose elements are the frequency of different 
word n-grams in the essay.  Another possible rep-
resentation is to use binary representation, i.e., 1 
indicates this word n-gram is in this essay, 0 indi-
cates this word n-gram is not in this essay.  One 
interesting question to ask is:  
Which representation can be more informative 
to distinguish the native language of writers of es-
says? 
 Here we compare the performance of a fre-
quency-based word level n-gram representation 
and a binary-based word level n-gram representa-
tion. We included all word level n-grams in the 
training set, without any frequency cutoff.  For 
both binary-based and frequency-based representa-
tions, we run the experiments on the two settings:  
punctuation marks are either removed or kept. 
In addition to word level n-grams, since 
TOEFL11 also consists of English proficiency lev-
els evaluated by assessment experts, we also in-
cluded it to test whether this feature might improve 
the classification performance.  All of the features 
used in our system are summarized in Table 1.  
Besides each feature described above, we have also 
combined different features to test whether various 
combinations of features might improve the accu-
racy performance.  Here, we simply aggregated 
different features, for example, all word level uni-
grams, combined with all word level bigrams. 
4.3 Classifier 
Previous literatures have used various methods 
such as Na?ve Bayse, logistic regression and sup-
port vector machine on NLI problem.  As it has 
been shown that when representing an essay in 
order to perform a classification task, it often re-
sults in an essay being represented in a very high 
dimensional space.  Since support vector machine 
(SVM) is known to be adaptive when the feature 
dimension is high, we chose SVM as our classifi-
cation algorithm.   We also compared the results 
from Na?ve Bayse for an experimental purpose and 
found that SVM is better. We use SVM-Light for 
our system (Joachims, 1999).  We then train our 
SVM classifier on the training set (n=9900), and 
test the trained classifier on the testing set 
(n=1100).

5 Results and Discussions 
5.1 Results 
Table 1 and Table 2 show the accuracies on the 
testing set for the different feature sets, when punc-
tuation marks are removed or kept respectively.  
As the results demonstrated, the accuracies of word 
level bigram are better than unigram using a bi-
nary-based representation.  When combining word 
level unigram and bigram, the accuracy is im-
proved in a binary-based representation.  This is 
consistent when punctuations are either removed or 
kept.  This observation is consistent with the exist-
ing NLI literatures: when combining word n-grams, 
it seems to improve the accuracy of the classifier, 
compared with a word n-gram alone. But we do 
not observe too much difference when punctuation 
marks are removed or kept, using both unigram 
and bigram. In fact, including punctuation marks 
lead to high accuracies in many scenarios, espe-
cially in unigram in a frequency-based representa-
tion, suggesting the usage of punctuation marks 
varies across native languages.

5.2 Binary Based of Word N-Gram Repre-
sentation 
We observe that the accuracy of a binary-based 
word level n-gram representation in our system is 
significantly better than a frequency-based repre-
sentation.  This is similar to the result reported by 
Blanchard et al, (2013) in TOEFL11 corpus.  The 
differences between their system and ours are that 
the system developed by Blanchard et al, (2013) 
used logistic regression with L1-regularzation, in-
stead of SVM and they did not remove all punctua-
tion marks and special characters.   
This might imply that a frequency-based word 
n-gram representation do not capture the character-
istics of the data. This might be because the data 
resides in a high dimension space, and the frequen-
cies of word level n-grams would be skewed.  In a 
future study, one might investigate a better repre-
sentation form and other complex features that 
have a stronger interpretative power of the data.  
5.3 Effects of Proficiency Level 
In our results, we have included English profi-
ciency level (low/medium/high) as a feature pro-
vided by assessment experts.  However, we did not 
find a strong improvement in accuracies, for ex-
ample, 79.13% using a binary-based word level n-
grams when punctuation marks removed.  We 
think this might be because only one feature will 
155
not dramatically change the accuracies.  This may 
be due to the fact word n-grams have already con-
tributed a large amount of features.  
6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we used a new data set, TOEFL11 to 
investigate NLI. In the most existing literatures, 
ICLE corpus was used. However, ICLE has fewer 
data and is known to be biased to topics of essays.  
The newly released corpus, TOEFL11 addresses 
these two drawbacks, which is useful for NLI 
community.  Support vector machine (SVM) was 
used as a classifier in our system.  We have dem-
onstrated that a binary-based word level n-gram 
representation has resulted in a significantly better 
performance compared to a frequency-based n-
gram representation.  We observed that there is not 
much difference in classification accuracies when 
punctuation removed or kept, when combining 
both unigram and bigram.  Interestingly, a fre-
quency-based word unigram with punctuation 
marks outperforms than the case without punctua-
tion marks, suggesting the potential of utilizing 
punctuation marks in NLI.  In addition, English 
proficiency level has also been included in our fea-
ture set, but did not yield a significant improve-
ment in accuracy.  As most of the essays are 
represented in a high dimension space using word 
level n-grams, we are looking into feature selection 
to reduce dimensionality and how to represent 
those features in order to improve accuracy, as 
well as other features.
