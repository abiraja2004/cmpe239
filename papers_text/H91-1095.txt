PROJECT GOALS 
Our primary goal is the development of robust and 
portable systems for processing natural anguage 
text, particularly for the purposes of extracting 
information or retrieving passages or documents 
from a text collection. A major focus has been on 
automatically or semi-antomatically acquiring the 
syntactic and semantic characteristics of new 
domains from samples of text. 
RECENT WORK 
Over the last few months we have begun to adapt 
our Proteus information extraction system to pro- 
cess reports of terrorist activity. This is being done 
as part of MUC (Message Understanding Confer- 
ence) -3, a comparative evaluation of information 
extraction systems organized by the Naval Ocean 
Systems Center. These reports are substantially 
more complex, both syntactically and semanti- 
cally, than the Navy operational reports we previ- 
ously processed. Considerable effort has therefore 
gone into extending our grammatical coverage and 
improving the efficiency and accuracy of our 
parser; we have experimented with several tech- 
niques, including closest attachment heuristics, 
merging of alternative analyses of constituents, 
statistically-lrained stochastic grammars, and sto- 
chastic part-of-speech tagging prior to parsing (the 
last done in collaboration with BBN Systems and 
Technologies Corp.). 
We have also begun to investigate the benefits of 
natural language processing for document 
retrieval. We have developed a fast and robust 
Tagged Text Parser, which uses text stochastically 
tagged by part-of-speech (again with the assistance 
of BBN), and generates full syntactic analyses 
(,possibly skipping some unanalyzable consti- 
tuents). These parses are then used to identify co- 
occurrence patterns and compute similarity 
coefficients between words. This work, by Strzal- 
kowski and Vauthey, is reported in a separate 
paper in these proceedings. 
Finally, as part of our research on sublanguage- 
based machine translation, we are continuing 
development of our Japanese grammar. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Our primary task for the remainder of MUC-3 
(through May 1991) will be to incorporate addi- 
tional semantic information about the terrorist 
domain. We intend to do this, as much as possible, 
through semi-automatic techniques driven by the 
parsed corpus of 1300 reports. Following comple- 
tion of the formal evaluation i  May, we expect o 
spend considerable time evaluating the contribu- 
tions of various ystem features to our overall per- 
formance. 
For document retrieval, we intend to utilize a clus- 
tering procedure which, based on the similarity 
coefficients we have generated, will form domain- 
specific word classes. We will then investigate he 
benefits of using these word classes as a thesaurus 
for keyword-based document retrieval, using a 
standard ocument test collection. 
Finally, we expect over the coming year to bring 
together our pilot study of sublanguage-based 
machine translation, our work on reversible gram- 
mars, and our Japanese and English grammars to 
create a reversible Japanese-English translation 
system, albeit initially operating on a very limited 
domain and vocabulary.
