ABSTRACT 
We have been addressing the problem of providing access to the 
free text in biomedical databases. The focus of our work is the 
development of SPECIALIST, an experimental NLP system for the 
biomedical domain. The system includes a broad coverage parser 
supported by a large lexicon, a module that provides access to 
extensive biomedical knowledge sources, and a retrieval module 
that allows us to carry out experiments in information retrieval. 
We have recently conducted experiments with a test collection of 
queries and documents retrieved for those queries. The purpose of 
the investigation has been to determine the type of information that 
is required in order to effect a map between the language of queries 
and the language of relevant documents. 
1, INTRODUCTION 
Retrieval of information from computerized atabases is 
a complex process whose success depends heavily on the 
user's knowledge of the structure and logic of the particular 
database being searched. Many databases have associated 
with them a controlled indexing vocabulary, or thesaurus, 
which is the primary access point to the material at search 
time. For example, the National of Library of Medicine's 
MESH? thesaurus includes some 16,000 headings that are 
available for indexing and searching the biomedical literature 
stored in MEDLINE?, NLM's bibliographic database. The 
major retrieval strategy is to coordinate MeSH terms with 
boolean operators, although limited text word searching of 
titles and abstracts i also possible. 
Several years ago NLM launched its Unified Medical Lan- 
guage System TM (UMLS TM) project. This is a major esearch 
initiative whose goal it is to facilitate retrieval and integration 
of information from multiple disparate biomedical databases. 
NLM itself has developed and maintains over 40 databases, 
and there are many other sources of computerized information 
in the biomedical sciences. These include factual databases 
of various kinds, diagnostic expert systems, clinical informa- 
tion systems, as well as bibliographic databases. The UMLS 
project is attempting to develop methods whereby access is 
provided to these different systems with their different vo- 
cabularies in a way which allows the user to navigate among 
them with relative ease. Recent results of the project have 
been the development of an Information Sources Map of 
biomedical databases, a Metathesaurus TM of biomedical vo- 
cabularies and a Semantic Network of high-level biomedical 
concepts\[I,2\]. The first release of the Information Sources 
Map contains a description of the scope, content, and ac- 
cess conditions for approximately fifty biomedical databases. 
The Metathesaurus includes over 67,000 biomedical concepts 
from a variety of controlled vocabularies. Definitions, lexical 
category information, hierarchical contexts, and interrela- 
tionships among many of the terms found in its constituent 
vocabularies are provided. Each concept in the Metathesaurus 
has been assigned to at least one of the 131 semantic types 
in the Semantic Network. The Network has top level nodes 
for organisms, anatomical structures, biologic function and 
dysfunction, chemicals, events, and concepts. The Network 
defines these types and establishes a set of 35 potential rela- 
tionships between them. These include physical, temporal, 
functional, and conceptual links, e.g., part of, co-occurs with, 
causes, measures. The Network and the Metathesaurus to- 
gether form a rich knowledge source of biomedical concepts. 
The knowledge sources will continue to be augmented and 
refined based on experimentation in a variety of applications, 
including our own. 
Our work is motivated by an interest in the development 
and testing of natural language processing techniques for im- 
proved methods of information retrieval. Document retrieval 
systems, in particular, are "language-rich" and afford the 
opportunity to conduct basic research in processing complex 
natural anguage text. The focus of our work is the devel- 
opment of SPECIALIST, an experimental NLP system for 
the biomedical domain\[3,4,5\]. The system includes a broad 
coverage parser 1 supported by a large lexicon, a module 
that accesses the UMLS knowledge sources, and a retrieval 
module. SPECIALIST runs on Sun workstations and is im- 
plemented in Quintus Prolog, with some support modules 
written in C. 
We have recently conducted experiments using a test collec- 
tion of user queries and MEDLINE citation records retrieved 
for those queries. The data for the test collection were se- 
1During the academic year 1988-1989 we awarded a research contract 
to the Paoli Research Center of the Unisys Corporation. As a result of 
this successful collaboration between our two research groups, the syntactic 
component of the system is extremely robusL See\[6,7\] for a description of 
the Paoli system.

lected from 2,000 search request forms submitted by health 
professionals to the NIH and NLM libraries. 155 queries 
were chosen, approximately 50 each in the three major areas 
covered by MEDLINE - clinical medicine research, basic 
science research, and health services research. Searches were 
conducted by an expert NLM searcher, and the approximately 
3,000 citations retrieved were evaluated for relevancy by a 
subject matter expert\[8\]. Each citation record in the collection 
includes a title and an author-prepared abstract. 
We parsed the queries, titles and selected portions of abstracts 
in the test collection. For all successful parses, noun phrases 
were extracted and whatever synonyms could be found in 
the Metathesaurus and in our online version of the Dorland's 
Illustrated Medical Dictionary\[5\] were added to the noun 
phrases to form a concept group. We then attempted toeffect 
a match between the concepts in the queries and the concepts 
in relevant citations. We found that the mapping involves a 
wide range of inferences. It is only in rare cases that concepts 
map directly from queries to documents. More commonly, 
several inferences are necessary in order to determine that a 
citation is in fact relevant to a request. 
The remainder of this paper begins with a discussion of 
some of the salient issues in information retrieval. This is 
followed by a brief description of the major components of 
the SPECIALIST system, and the paper ends with an account 
of our recent investigations in mapping queries to relevant 
documents. 
2. THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL 
PROBLEM 
One of the essential characteristics of document storage 
and retrieval is the parallelism between the indexing and 
searching processes. Text is subjected to either manual or 
automatic indexing. If it is manual, there will generally be 
indexing rules. For example, in the case of NLM's MEDLINE 
database, one rule says that articles hould be indexed with the 
most specific terms available in NLM's MeSH vocabulary\[9\]. 
Thus, if an article is about aplastic anemia it should be indexed 
under that term (which is a bona fide MeSH term) and not 
under either the more general term "anemia" or the even more 
general term "hematologic diseases". At search time, the user 
(or program acting on the user's behalf) needs to take this into 
account when formulating a search strategy and statement. 
Even if the indexing is automatic, and it may be as simple as 
creating an inverted index for all the words in the document, 
the user (or program) needs to be aware of the conventions 
for creating that index. This includes recognition of the fact 
that text words are generally run against a stopword list of 
function words and other highly frequent words before they 
are entered in the database. For example, if the user wants 
to query the MEDLINE database on "the effects of acidosis 
on ATP" and uses text words only, the two words "acidosis" 
and "ATP" will individually ield many postings and their 
coordination will yield another, smaller, set. However, adding 
in the word "effects" will not make the search results any 
more precise, since, as a highly frequent word in biomedical 
documents, this word has been placed on the stopword list. 
Without some knowledge of these conventions, the results 
can be confusing to end users. 
Feedback of various kinds allows the user to negotiate with 
the retrieval system. This may involve refining a search 
statement based on viewing the set of rifles or documents 
initially retrieved, or finding that because the number of 
postings for a search statement is unacceptably large or 
small that the search strategy has been too broad, or too 
narrow, or misformulated in some other way. It may also 
involve accessing information about the indexing rules or 
controlled vocabulary used in the system. The effect of this 
feedback is that it makes the user more aware of both the 
potential of the retrieval system as well as its limitations. 
Most researchers in intelligent interface design assume to 
one degree or another that the user will be "left in the loop" 
to negotiate with the system, resolving ambiguities, making 
relevancy judgements, and revising searches based on (user- 
independen0 information supplied by the system. (See\[10\] 
for a strong statement about he desirabilty of giving the user 
maximum control over the entire search interaction.) 
Many of the attempts that have been made to apply NLP 
to information retrieval have involved the search interface; 
others have involved the indexing process. See\[11\] for a 
review of some of the more recent research efforts. The results 
of applying NLP to the information retrieval problem have 
not always been encouraging\[12\]. It is important to recognize 
why this might be so. First, retrieval experiments have been 
carried out that use partially developed parsing systems and 
then compare these results with other non-NLP methods. The 
results of these comparisons hould, therefore, be viewed 
with caution. In some cases, so-called stemming procedures 
have been used which embody some linguistic sophistication, 
but, again, are not fully motivated or developed. The results 
of these experiments again underscore the limitations of the 
incomplete methods used. Second, given that the indexing 
and retrieval processes are so closely related, a successful 
application of NLP will need to be fully integrated with 
both processes. Some of the inconclusive results in\[13\], for 
example, may derive from a decision to ignore this point. 
3. THE SPECIALIST SYSTEM 
3.1 Lexicon and Parser 
Lexical information is central to our parsing system. The 
lexicon currently contains some 51,000 lexical items, with 
over 88,000 lexical forms. It includes both general English 
lexical items as well as items specific to the domain of 
219 
biomedicine. Lexical entries are created using our lexicon 
building tool called Lextool. Lextool is a menu-based system 
which accepts as input either a file of lexical items or lexical 
items typed in from the keyboard. With the interactive aid of 
the user, it generates fully specified lexical frames. Lextool 
incorporates rules that dictate which slots are permissible 
for the syntactic ategory in question. The coding system 
is closely tied to the codes given in the first edition of the 
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English\[14\], although 
we have modified this scheme somewhat, and we have added 
additional codes, for example, those for logical interpretation, 
such as subject control, object raising, etc. We do not have 
the Longman dictionary in machine readable form, but other 
online information sources are available to lexical coders 
in the Lextool environment. These include the Dorland's 
Illustrated Medical Dictionary\[5\]; Meshtool, our MeSH vo- 
cabulary browser; Meta, the Metathesaurus retrieval system; 
and access to sample sentences from MEDLINE citations 
which contain the lexical items in question. The two sample 
records hown below illustrate the type of information that is 
encoded for lexical items 2. 
base--sad 
entry=l 
cat=adj 
variants=regd 
position=attrib(1) 
position=pred 
compl=fincomp(t):subj 
compl=fincomp(t) 
nominaiization=sadness 
base=aim 
entry=l 
cat=noun 
variants=uncount 
variants=reg 
entry=2 
cat=verb 
variants=reg 
intran 
tran=infcomp:subjc 
tran=np 
tran=pphr(at,np) 
tran=pphr(at,ingcomp:subjc) 
tran=pphr(for, np) 
tran=pphr(for,ingcomp:subjc) 
ditran=np,pphr(at,np) 
2Semantic and pragmatic information is not stored irectly with lexical 
entries. We are, however, currently considering a variety of approaches to 
semantics and our future work in this area may wen have an impact on the 
structure ofthe lexical entries. 
The record for "sad" illustrates the sort of information we 
encode for adjectives. Included is variant information (i.e., 
whether the adjective forms regular comparative and superla- 
fives); positional information, e.g., whether the adjective is 
predicative, attributive, or both; adjective type (e.g., the "1" 
in "attrib(1)" indicates that this is an adjective of quality); in- 
formation about possible complements (e.g, finite, infinitival 
complements); and information about any nominalizations. 
The record for "aim" illustrates ome of the information we 
encode for nouns and verbs. Noun frames include variant 
information and information about possible complements and 
nominalizations, if relevant. Verbs are most extensively 
coded. While any particular complement slot of a verb is 
optional, at least one from the set "intran, "man", "ditran", or 
"cplxtran", must be chosen. In addition, the particular type 
of object is encoded. For example, aim as a verb may be 
transitive, and if so, it can take a single np as an object or one 
of a variety of prepositional phrase complements (e.g., "aim 
at the target", "aim at winning", "aim for the best", etc.). 
The grammar includes context-free BNF rules together with 
context-sensitive restrictions. It is based heavily on the Pundit 
grammar, but we continue to refine and modify it so that it can 
handle new constructions and additional lexical attributes. A 
slightly simplified sample parse is shown below. 
S = Rifampin is administered in the treatment of tuberculosis. 
OPS: present, passive 
VERB: administer 
SUB J: null 
OBJ: rifampin (sing,(Pharmacologic Substance)) 
PP: in 
treatment (sing,(Therapeutic Procedure)) 
RMOD: of 
tuberculosis ( ing,(Disease or Syndrome)) 
We have investigated the possiblity of using the UMLS 
semantic types for expressing selectional restrictions. Our 
initial assessment is that hey may be profitably used, but since 
we are currently developing a general approach to semantics, 
we have not yet implemented any restrictions of this sort. In 
the meantime, we report semantic types in the output parse. 
The semantic types are not directly encoded in lexical entries, 
but are looked up at parse time in our Metathesaurus retrieval 
application. 
3.2  Access  to  Knowledge Sources  
The Metathesaurus application allows users (or programs) 
to search for Metathesaurus terminology, reporting the term 
and its source vocabulary; its definition, synonyms, related 
or associated terms; its semantic types; its lexical tags and 
variants; or its contexts, e.g., its ancestors or descendants. 
220 
Simplified sample output for some queries for "Gierke's 
disease" are shown below. Note that "Gierke's disease" is 
a synonym of "Glycogen Storage Disease Type r',  and is, 
therefore, mapped to this term throughout. 
\[CN = concept name, DEF = definition, VOC = source vo- 
cabulary (MSH = MeSH, SNOMED = Systematized Nomen- 
clature of Medicine), STY = semantic type, SY = synonym\]. 
Concept Definition \[return to quit\]: Gierke's disease 
CN: Glycogen Storage Disease Type I 
DEF: An autosomal recessive disease in which gene 
expression of glucose-6-phosphatase is absent, 
resulting in hypoglycemia due to lack of glucose 
production. Accumulation of glycogen in liver and 
kidney leads to organomegaly, particularly massive 
hepatomegaly. Increased concentrations of lactic acid 
and hyperlipidemia appear in the plasma. Clinical gout 
often appears in early childhood.

3.3  Ret r ieva l  Modu le  
As noted above, we have developed a retrieval module in 
order to test he extent to which NLP techniques may improve 
information retrieval. The current implementation f the 
module processes files such as MEDLINE citation records, 
creates an index for the items in all relevant fields, including 
MeSH terminology and text words, and provides for boolean 
retrieval of these items. In addition to retrieval based on the 
MeSH vocabulary and text words, the retrieval module also 
provides for noun phrase xtraction, indexing, and retrieval. 
A noun phrase index is created by parsing the textual fields of 
input records, generating several variants of each noun phrase 
and computing synonyms of each variant. During retrieval, 
noun phrases are similarly extracted from a parse of the user's 
query and processed against he noun phrase index. 
The retrieval module gives us direct access to the test collec- 
tion of queries and citation records and was heavily used in 
the experiment reported below. 
4. MAPP ING QUERIES  TO DOCUMENTS 
Locating relevant documents in a bibliographic database is a 
complex process that involves users - their knowledge of the 
subject matter, their understanding of the conventions of the 
database, their familiarity with the interface to that database 
- and it involves the relationship between the meaning of a 
query and the meaning of a relevant document. 
A query generally is directed to just one, or perhaps a few 
aspects, of a full document. The relationship between the 
query and document may be direct, or it may be quite indirect. 
The following examples from the test collection illustrate 3.
A query in the clinical medicine research portion of the 
collection is, "Causes, treatment, signs and symptoms of 
depression specifically in the post partum period (i.e., first 
year after childbirth or traceable to the event of childbirth). 
To include mild depression (also known as 'baby blues') to 
post partum psychosis." The title of a relevant citation is, 
"A prospective study of postpartum psychoses in a high-risk 
group. Clinical characteristics of the current postpartum 
episodes." Here the title clearly answers at least part of the 
3As noted above, the queries were collected from two medical fibraries. 
They consist primarily of search request forms filled in by users of these 
fibraries. The language is, therefore, the natural language ofthe user, and it 
is directed to a human search specialist rather than to a computer interface. 
221 
query directly and is, thus, deemed relevant. 
A somewhat less direct correspondence between the query and 
document is shown by an example from the health services 
research portion of the collection. The query is, "Attitudes 
of health personnel as it relates to neoplasms, AIDS, and 
ALS." The title of one of the documents retrieved for this 
query is, "The impact of a program to enhance the compe- 
tencies of primary care physicians in caring for patients with 
AIDS." The abstract, while not directly discussing attitudes 
of physicians treating AIDS patients does indicate that of 635 
physicians interviewed, only 30 percent "demonstrated a e- 
quate knowledge of practices necessary to deal with patients' 
AIDS-related symptoms and concerns." 
Our recent investigations have looked at the degree of sim- 
ilarity between the language of a query and the language of 
a relevant document. Our experiments involved parsing the 
query and document texts, extracting the constituent noun 
phrases, augmenting these with synonyms and other variants, 
and then attempting to map queries to relevant documents. 
We found that the mappings are almost never straightforward 
and almost always involve multiple inferences. 
Our current parsing system was able to handle about 45 
percent of the 155 queries and about 55 percent of the 3,078 
titles in the collection. As we analyzed particular phenomena, 
we parsed selected portions of some of the abstracts. Both 
the queries and the titles are generally complex noun phrases, 
but queries tend to be more elliptical and much less well- 
formed than titles. Abstracts consist of well-formed English 
sentences, but some of the structures found there are highly 
specialized. The following sentence from one of the abstracts 
illustrates: "At 55-57 days of age, the animals were divided 
into the following dietary treatment groups: A) 4.5 96 fat 
\[control fat (CF)\]; B) CF + 1.0 MMOL ROA/kg diet (CF + 
ROA); C) 20.0 ~ fat \[high fat (HF)\]; D) I-IF + ROA." 
Our investigations have indicated that the mapping between 
queries and documents involves arange of phenomena. When 
concepts do not map directly to each other, it is often the case 
that various types of relations between them are the key to a 
successful mapping. The synonymy relation is clearly of great 
importance to robust retrieval systems. The more synonyms 
or closely related terms there are available at search time, the 
more likely it is that a user will find the desired ocuments. 
(For example, see\[15\] for the view that traditional retrieval 
systems would be greatly improved by the addition of huge 
numbers of synonyms, or "aliases"). The synonymy must, 
however, go beyond the word-level to the phrase-level. An 
example from our experiment illustrates. The fairly simple 
query is, "Vitamin C and immunity". The title of a relevant 
citation is "Effect of ascorbic acid on humoral and other 
factors of immunity in coal-tar exposed workers." Both the 
4For our purposes a document  consists of  a title and an abstract. 
Metatbesaurus and the Dorland dictionary list "vitamin C" 
and "ascorbic acid" as synonyms, o, in this case, parsing the 
query and title, together with a look-up in our online resources 
has the desired effect. 
Another example illustrates ome of the more complex rela- 
tions that may exist between concepts in queries and docu- 
ments. The query is, "Hematoporphyrin derivative treatment 
of tumors using a laser." The first sentence of a relevant 
citation is, "Photoradiation with photosensitizing porphyrins 
offers a potentially useful approach to the diagnosis and treat- 
ment of certain human cancers." The system must recognize 
that hematoporphyrin is a kind of porphyrin, that tumors 
are related to cancer, and that the use of a laser is implied 
by photoradiation. Access to the knowledge contained in 
the Metathesaurus does, in fact, allow these inferences to 
be made. A sub-tree in the MeSH hierarchy, one of the 
constituent vocabularies in the Metathesaurus, i  shown be- 
low. Hematoporphyrin is shown to be a narrower term than 
porphyrin and the isa link is implied: 
Chemicals and Drugs 
Growth Substances, Pigments, Vitamins 
Pigments 
Porphyrins 
Hematoporphyrins 
Tumor is listed as a synonym of neoplasm which is itself a 
broader term than cancer in the Metathesaurus, and photora- 
diation is listed as a synonym of light which is broader than 
lasers: 
Physical Sciences 
Physics 
Optics 
Light 
Lasers 
By navigating through the interrelationships expressed in 
the Metathesaurus structure, the system is able to draw the 
appropriate inferences. 
Another example illustrates a somewhat more complex case. 
The query is, "Ocular complications of Myasthenia Gravis". 
A relevant title is, "Myasthenia gravis and recurrent retrob- 
ulbar optic neuritis: an unusual combination of diseases". 
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder and is gen- 
erally associated with ocular complications of a muscular 
nature, such as ptosis, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. The 
optic neuritis mentioned in the title is, however, an inflamma- 
tory disorder. The correct inference can be made by referring 
to the Semantic Network which has established the poten- 
tial relation "complicates" between any two co-occurring 
diseases. In this case, then, the literature has actually instanti- 
222 
ated the "complicates" relationship between the two normally 
unrelated isorders mentioned in the rifle. 
It is clear that while identifying noun phrases in queries 
and documents will improve the mapping capabilities of a 
retrieval system, it will not be capable of drawing many 
of the deeper inferences that are required. A fairly simple 
example makes the point. The query is, "Thermography 
for indications other than breast." An obviously relevant title 
is, "Use of thermogram in detection of meningitis." Here a 
system needs to know that "breast" actually refers to "breast 
disorders" and that "other than" is a negative operator. As 
we incorporate more semantics into our parser, some of these 
inferences should fall out. 
Most often the process of locating a relevant document in- 
volves mapping sets of concepts and their interrelationships n 
queries onto similar sets of concepts and interrelationships n 
documents. These interrelationships between major concepts 
may be explicit or they may be implicit. An example of an 
explicit relation is shown in the following query, "Transillu- 
mination light scanning for use in the detection of diseases 
of the breast.". A relevant title for this query is "The value of 
dlaphanograpy asan adjunct o mammography in breast di- 
agnostics." Here the notion of using a particular technique to 
detect, or diagnose, the disorder is of paramount importance. 
An example of an implicit relationship is shown in the query, 
"Neoplasia in kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients." 
The user is probably interested inarticles that discuss neopla- 
sia arising as a result of of the transplant (or more likely the 
immunosuppressive th rapy associated with the transplant), 
but this is not directly stated. A relevant title for this query 
is, in fact, "Development of incidence of cancer following 
cyclosporine therapy." 
In many cases, it will not be possible for a system to draw 
the appropriate inferences without the interactive aid of the 
user. This is most likely if only noun phrases are presented as 
a search statement. For example, if a query consists imply 
of the two terms "rifampin" and "tuberculosis", multiple 
interpretations of the relationship between these terms are 
possible. The Semantic Network, for example, provides the 
following potential relationships between drugs and diseases: 
affects, prevents, complicates, treats, diagnoses, and causes. 
If the user is presented with the set of possible relations 
between drugs and diseases, a choice can be made and the 
query can be further efined. 
Our work to date has revealed a variety of inferences that must 
be made if the attempt to map a query to a relevant document 
is to be successful. We intend to continue our explorations of 
these phenomena, nd we have begun to develop an approach 
to handling some of them. Our online sources of biomedical 
information have already proven to be of direct use in making 
some of the appropriate inferences.
