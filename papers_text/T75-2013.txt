THE PHRASAL LEXICON 
Joseph D. Becker 
ABSTRACT 
Theoretical  l inguists have in 
recent years concentrated their 
attent ion on the productive aspect 
of language, wherein utterances are 
formed combinator ica l ly  from units 
the size of words or smaller. This 
paper will focus on the contrary 
aspect of language, wherein 
utterances are formed by 
repetit ion, modif icat ion, and 
concatenat ion of prev ious ly -known 
phrases consist ing of more than one 
word. I suspect that we speak 
mostly by st itching together 
swatches of text that we have heard 
before; productive processes have 
the secondary role of adapting the 
old phrases to the new situation. 
The advantage of this point of view 
is that it has the potential  to 
account for the observed l inguist ic 
behavior of native speakers, rather 
than discounting their actual 
behavior as irrelevant to their 
language. In particular, this 
point of view allows us to concede 
that most utterances are produced 
in stereotyped social situations, 
where the communicat ive and 
r i tual ist ic  functions of language 
demand not novelty, but rather an 
appropr iate combinat ion of 
formulas, cliches, idioms, 
al lusions, slogans, and so forth. 
Language must have or iginated in 
such constrained social contexts, 
and they are sti l l  the predominant 
arena for language production. 
Therefore an understanding of the 
use of phrases is basic to the 
understanding of language as a 
whole. 
You are current ly reading a 
much-abr idged version of a paper 
that wil l  be publ ished elsewhere 
later. 
It's Not WHAT You S~?,.. 
Like all other scientists, l inguists 
wish they were physicists. They dream of 
performing classic feats like dropping 
grapefruits off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, 
of stunning the world with pithy truths like 
"F=ma", and in general of having language 
behave in an orderly way so that they could 
discover the Universal  Laws behind it all. 
L inguists have a problem because language 
just ain't l ike that. Physical  laws are 
very basic, general -purpose const i tutents of 
the universe, so the Creator was forced to 
keep them elegant and potently simple. 
Language, by contrast, was recently invented 
by Man for the sole purpose of giving his 
Fel low Man the low-down; for this reason 
language is  inextr icably bound to humans, 
60 
human communication, and the c i rcumstances 
of human communication. 
Nevertheless, l inguists have tried to 
extr icate the inextricable. The first level 
of extr icat ion is to declare that there is 
such a thing as "language", and that all 
other items like human beings, psychology, 
physical objects, events, and social 
s i tuations are "non-l inguist ic" and should 
please go away. The second level of 
extr icat ion is to declare that there is such 
a thing as "competence", which is what a 
language would be like if a decent 
mathemat ic ian had drafted it, and that all 
other items like everything that people 
actual ly say, write, or think are 
"performance" and should please go away. 
And so the "modern" l inguist spends his 
or her time starr ing or unstarr ing terse 
unl ikely sentences like "John, Bil l  and Tom 
ki l led each other" (to pick one at random 
from a recent journal), which seethe with 
repressed frustrat ion and are dif f icult  to 
work into a conversation. These example 
sentences bear no discernable resemblance to 
the sentences which compose the text that 
purportedly explains them -- yet the 
l inguist 's own sentences are also al leged 
(implicit ly) to be drawn from the same 
Engl ish Language! Perhaps it is time that 
editors, or at least readers, began applying 
Becker's Cr iter ion to their readings in 
l inguist ic theory: 
BECKER'S CRITERION 
Any theory (or partial theory) of 
the Engl ish Language that is 
expounded in the Engl ish Language 
must account for (or at least apply 
to) the text of its own exposit ion. 
Using this handy guideline, you can pretty 
much wipe your theoret ical  l inguist ics shelf  
clean and start over. 
This is not to say that there has been 
no construct ive value in the attempt to 
physicize (i.e., mathematic ize)  natural  
languages. Without question, many important 
regular i t ies have been discovered thanks to 
this approach. Nevertheless,  I feel that 
for a science to attempt to deny the 
existence of nearly all of its subject 
matter (English as she is spoke) and to deny 
the existence of the substrate of its 
subject matter (communicat ion between human 
beings) is (I) sc ient i f ica l ly  dishonest, and 
therefore (2) u l t imately self -defeating. 
Modern theoret ical  l inguist ics is rather 
clearly se l f -defeated already, and l inguists 
have yielded the scienti f ic in it iatve to 
untutored computer types. The latter are 
re lat ively unski l led in sophistry, but they 
have been trained to unf l inchingly  confront 
large-scale, complex, inelegant, real -wor ld 
behavioral  systems such as language, and to 
attempt to understand the workings of these 
systems without vainly pretending that they 
can be reduced to pr ist ine-pure mathemat ica l  
formulations.

Let's Face Facts 
Most of this paper will be devoted to 
organizing and presenting the facts 
concerning our knowledge of English phrases, 
rather than to expounding a theory that 
would explain these facts. There are four 
reasons for this. First, the conspiracy of 
si lence which has surrounded these facts has 
lasted for so many years that it is 
worthwhi le to take a good look at them. 
Second, I hope to present the beginnings of 
a taxonomy for lexical phrases. Third, the 
phrases  themselves are more interest ing than 
any theory will ever be. And of course 
fourth, I don't have a theory. But actual ly 
the elements of such a theory are already 
clear and present, as I will suggest in the 
last two sections. 
The structures I am discussing in this 
paper have often been swept under the rug by 
means of the disclaimer "Oh, that's an 
idiom." The result is that we now find a lot 
of apples and oranges under the same rug. 
In order to replace the useless term "idiom" 
with a taxonomy of some substance, I am 
proposing six major categories of lexical 
phrases. The categories are l isted in order 
of increasing "size" of the members, as the 
descript ions below should make apparent. 
CLASS I: Polywords 
Nature: Mult i -word phrases admitt ing no 
variabil ity, interchangeable with 
single words or concepts. 
Function: The same as single words. 
Euphemisms sometimes fall into 
this category. 
Examples: the oldest 
profession (n.) \[= prost itut ion\]  
to blow up (vi., vt.) \[= to 
explode\] 
for good (adv.) \[= forever\] 
CLASS II: Phrasal Constraints 
Nature: Units consist ing of a small 
number of words, some of which 
constrain the var iabi l i ty of 
others; in the l imit ing case the 
whole phrase is invariable. 
Function: Often specify how a part icular 
expressive function is to be 
appl ied to part icular semantic 
material. 
Example: If we wish to say that something 
happened coincidental ly,  and we 
wish to underscore that 
assertion, we say that it 
happened "by pure coincidence"; 
stronger yet is to say "by sheer 
coincidence." 
61 
CLASS III: Deictic Locutions 
Nature: Phrases with low variabi l i ty, 
short - to-medium length. 
Function: Serve as clauses or whole 
utterances whose purpose is to 
direct the course of 
conversation, i.e. the f low of 
expectations, emotions, 
attitudes, etc. 
Examples: for that matter 
\[= "I just thought of a 
better way of making my 
point"\] 
. . . ,that's all. \[= don't get 
f lustered\] 
CLASS IV :Sentence  Builders 
Nature: Phrases up to sentence length, 
often containing slots for 
"parameters" or "arguments". 
Function: Provide the skeleton for the 
expression of an entire idea. 
Example: (person A) gave (person B) a 
(long) song and dance about (a 
topic). 
\[= "A tried to convince B of 
something, and was cynical 
and perhaps  less than 
truthful about what he 
said"\] 
CLASS V: Situat ional  Utterances 
Nature: Usual ly complete 
l itt le variabil ity. 
sentences, 
Function: Utterances which are known to be 
the appropr iate thing to say in 
certain circumstances; may be 
used out of context for effect. 
Examples: How can I ever repay you? 
\[expresses moderate-to- large 
gratitude in response to 
some kindness\] 
It only hurts when I laugh! 
\[expresses the unimportance 
of some apparent aff l ict ion; 
or ig inated as a Vaudevi l le  
joke\] 
CLASS VI: Verbat im Texts 
Nature: Texts of any length memorized 
verbatim, or approximately so. 
Function: Used as substance for quotation, 
al lusion, variation, and 
occasional ly  direct usage. 
Examples: Better late than 
never \ [p roverb \ ]  
How ya gonna keep em down on the 
farm? 
\[song title\] 
99 and 44/100 percent pure 
\[advertising slogan\] 
The Region of Extract ion and Processing 
In the textbook from which I first 
studied Russian, each lesson began with a 
section entit led "Idioms and Common 
Expressions", where they put everything the 
student couldn't understand on the basis of 
his current vocabulary. I'm sure I learned 
all of these phrases, but three in 
part icular stand out in my memory: Vyera 
Aleksyeevna otkrivayet dyyer" (Vera 
Aleksyeevna opens the door), vsya chisto 
l i teraturnaya dyeyatel 'nost"  prekonchalas" 
(all purely l iterary act iv ity came to an 
end), and raion dobichl ! obrabotki  (the 
region of extract ion and processing). Sad 
to say, this book did not prepare me for my 
visit to the Soviet Union. I d iscovered 
that the book's expression for asking the 
time of daY was not the one that people 
used, and that I had no idea whatsoever how 
to get a 10-kopek piece changed into three 
3"s and a I so I could use the vending 
machines. 
This is the real ity of language: In 
order to survive in society we ve got to 
know what to say, and we usual ly know it in 
advance by memoriz ing it. The suggest ion 
here is that the wonderful  feats of the 
human intellect, such as the use of 
language, are based at least as much on 
memorizat ion as on any impromptu 
problem-solv ing (in this case, the 
generat ion of novel utterances).  We owe 
this insight to Minsky, his), and I am glad 
to see it f inal ly being recognized. 
What does all this imply for a theory 
of language product ion? It implies to me 
that the process of speaking is 
Composit ional:  We start with the information 
we wish to convey and the att itudes toward 
that information that we wish to express or 
evoke, and we haul out of our phrasal 
lexicon some patterns that can provide the 
major elements of this expression. Then the 
problem is to stitch these phrases together 
into something roughly grammatical,  to fill 
in the blanks with the part iculars of  the 
case at hand, to modify the phrases if need 
be, and if all else fails to generate 
phrases from scratch to smooth over the 
transit ions or fill in any remaining 
conceptual  holes. 
My guess is that phrase-adapt ion and 
generative gap-f i l l ing are very roughly 
equal ly important in language production, as 
measured in processing time spent on each, 
or in const i tutents ar is ing from each. One 
way of making such an intuit ive est imate is 
simply to l isten to what people actual ly say 
when they speak. An independent way of 
gauging the importance of the phrasal 
lexicon is to determine its size. 
There is no dict ionary in Engl ish that 
comes even close to encompassing the variety 
of lexical phrases discussed in this paper, 
from cl iches to sentence patterns to 
wisecracks to song lyrics. The most 
respectable phraseological  dict ionary I have 
found is an Engl ish-Russian one which I 
bought when I found it to contain knee-high 
to a grasshopper. This book has 25,000 
entries. I estimate that I recognize about 
half of them (the rest being Brit ish or 
archaic), and that about half of the ones I 
think of are not in the book. This gives us 
a bal lpark estimate of around 25,000 
phrases, which is very much the same 
magnitude as our s ingle-word vocabular ies.  
And this does not include most of the Class 
VI Verbat im Texts. 
All in all, we must conclude that the 
phrasal lexicon is very real. Even 
excluding long verbatim texts, we probably 
know as many or more whole phrases than we 
know single words (and I suspect the 
disparity would be even greater for the 
under-educated, i.e. almost all of 
humanity, since book- learning adds more 
words but few social s i tuat ions to the 
indiv idual 's  experience). 
Because lexical phrases are real, they 
have an advantage over transformat ions and 
other such chimeras :in that they are 
actual ly  observable. Having read this 
paper, you wil l  have no trouble hearing the 
cl iches as they come tr ipping off the 
tongues of the folks that surround you. 
And, for better or for worse, you wil l  feel 
them popping out of your own brain when you 
speak and when you write. This experience 
should give you a better understanding of 
the process of language production than any 
theory I could espouse to you on paper. 
End Te~t 
Which brings us direct ly to the final 
and ult imate question: Does Becket's paper 
meet Becker's Cr i ter ion? Does the view of 
language propounded here at least apply to 
the language in which it is propounded? Well 
of course:

to have (an/the) advantage over 
tr ipping off the tongue 
for better or for worse 
which brings us to 
Yet if we look careful ly at the text of this 
paper, we find fairly long stretches without 
any apparent lexical phrases. About these, 
three points should be made. 
First, most of the lexical phrases that 
we actual ly use in speaking or writ ing are 
I so humble and uninterest ing that they would 
never appear on a list devoted to 
picturesque expressions like Dav? Jones's 
Locker. Yet these humble patterns do most 
J of the work of language production for us. 
For example, the first sentence of this 
paper (come to think of it) is composed of 
three humble patterns: 
Like all other 
scientists, l inguist ics- 
wish they were 
physicists. 
A: Like (pl. n.),... 
B: all other (pl. n.) 
C: (person) wishes (he/she) were 
(something) 
l You may say that these patterns are implicit  
in the lexical entries for the individual  
words plus the grammar of English, but I say 
that I am also famil iar with the patterns 
themselves. To write the first sentence of 
this paper, I brought forth pattern C to 
express my main thought, then took pattern A 
and nested pattern B into it to express my 
subordinate thought, and tacked this onto 
the front of pattern C. No wonder my paper 
conforms to my own theories! 
Second, nothing in this paper says that 
so-cal led "generative" processes do not play 
an important role in language production. I 
assert that their role is equal to or less 
than that of phrasal processes, but that 
does not make it zero. 
Third, writ ing is a special ized skil l 
that is not identical  to speaking, and 
technical  writ ing is especial ly so. It 
takes us years of strenuous effort to learn 
to write, beginning long after we have 
completed learning to speak, and most of us 
never learn to write very well at that. I 
I make this point, even though it somewhat 
weakens the impact of Becker's Criterion, in 
order to counteract the tendancy of 
intel lectuals to believe that their language 
i is typical of the language as a whole. It 
isn't. In particular, narrative monologues 
63 
do occur in the conversat ions of the 
unenl ightened, and I think you will find 
them to be much more phrase-based than is 
any technical essay. 
And so I conclude that the rather messy 
taxonomy given in this paper, and the messy 
Composit ional  notion of language production, 
have a fair amount of truth to them when we 
look at what people actual ly say, think and 
write. Indeed, I suggest that the realer 
the text, the messier and truer these 
notions become. All of this can of course 
be summed up in a single elegant principle, 
namely: 
BECKER'S RAZOR \] 
Elegance and truth are inversely related. 
Put that in your phrasal lexicon, and invoke 
it!
