1 Introduction
Producing detailed syntactic and semantic represen-
tations of natural language is essential for prac-
tical dialog systems such as plan-based assistants
and tutorial systems. Development of such systems
is time-consuming and costly as they are typically
hand-crafted for each application, and dialog corpus
data is more difcult to obtain than text. The TRIPS
parser and grammar addresses these issues by pro-
viding broad coverage of common constructions in
practical dialog and producing semantic representa-
tions suitable for dialog processing across domains.
Our system bootstraps dialog system development
in new domains and helps build parsed corpora.1
Evaluating deep parsers is a challenge (e.g., (Ka-
plan et al, 2004)). Although common bracketing
accuracy metrics may provide a baseline, they are
insufcient for applications such as ours that require
complete and correct semantic representations pro-
duced by the parser. We evaluate our parser on
bracketing accuracy against a statistical parser as a
baseline, then on a word sense disambiguation task,
and nally on full sentence syntactic and semantic
accuracy in multiple domains as a realistic measure
of system performance and portability.

tures. An unscoped neo-Davidsonian semantic rep-
resentation is built in parallel with the syntactic
representation. A sample logical form (LF) rep-
resentation for Load the oranges into the truck is
shown above. The TRIPS LF provides the neces-
sary information for reference resolution, surface
speech act analysis, and interpretations for a wide
variety of fragmentary utterances and conventional
phrases typical in dialog. The LF content comes
from a domain-independent ontology adapted from
FrameNet (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000; Dzikovska
et al, 2004) and linked to a domain-independent lex-
icon (Dzikovska, 2004).
The parser uses a bottom-up chart algorithm with
beam search. Alternative parses are scored with fac-
tors assigned to grammar rules and lexical entries by
hand, because due to the limited amount of corpus
data we have not yet been able to train a statistical
model that outperforms our hand-tuned factors.
3 Evaluation
As a rough baseline, we compared the bracketing
accuracy of our parser to that of a statistical parser
(Bikel, 2002), Bikel-M, trained on 4294 TRIPS
196
parse trees from the Monroe corpus (Stent, 2001),
task-oriented human dialogs in an emergency res-
cue domain. 100 randomly selected utterances were
held out for testing. The gold standard for evalu-
ation is created with the help of the parser (Swift
et al, 2004). Corpus utterances are parsed, and the
parsed output is checked by trained annotators for
full-sentence syntactic and semantic accuracy, reli-
able with a kappa score 0.79. For test utterances
for which TRIPS failed to produce a correct parse,
gold standard trees were manually constructed inde-
pendently by two linguists and reconciled. Table 1
shows results for the 100 test utterances and for the
subset for which TRIPS nds a spanning parse (74).
Bikel-M performs somewhat better on the bracket-
ing task for the entire test set, which includes utter-
ances for which TRIPS failed to nd a parse, but it
is lower on complete matches, which are crucial for
semantic interpretation.

Word senses are an important part of the LF rep-
resentation, so we also evaluated TRIPS on word
sense tagging against a baseline of the most common
word senses in Monroe. There were 546 instances of
ambiguous words in the 100 test utterances. TRIPS
tagged 90.3% (493) of these correctly, compared to
the baseline model of 75.3% (411) correct.
To evaluate portability to new domains, we com-
pared TRIPS full sentence accuracy on a subset
of Monroe that underwent a fair amount of devel-
opment (Tetreault et al, 2004) to corpora of key-
board tutorial session transcripts from new domains
in basic electronics (BEETLE) and differentiation
(LAM) (Table 2). The only development for these
domains was addition of missing lexical items and
two grammar rules. TRIPS full accuracy requires
correct speech act, word sense and thematic role as-
signment as well as complete constituent match.
Error analysis shows that certain senses and sub-
categorization frames for existing words are still

needed in the new domains, which can be rectied
fairly quickly. Finding and addressing such gaps is
part of bootstrapping a system in a new domain.
4 Conclusion
Our wide-coverage grammar, together with a
domain-independent ontology and lexicon, produces
semantic representations applicable across domains
that are detailed enough for practical dialog applica-
tions. Our generic components reduce development
effort when porting to new dialog domains where
corpus data is difcult to obtain.
