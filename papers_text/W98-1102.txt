Abstract 
This paper describes the motivation and 
design of the Corpus Encoding Standard 
(CES) (Ide, et al, (1996); Ide, 1998), an 
encoding standard for linguistic corpora 
intended to meet the need for the 
development of standardized encoding 
practices for linguistic corpora. The CES 
identifies a minimal encoding level that 
corpora must achieve to be considered 
standardized in terms of descriptive 
representation (marking of structural and 
linguistic information). It also provides 
encoding conventions for more extensive 
encoding and for linguistic annotation, as 
well as general architecture for representing 
corpora annotated for linguistic features. The 
CES has been developed taking into account 
several practical realities surrounding the 
encoding of corpora intended for use in 
language engineering research and 
applications. Full documentation of the 
standard is available on the World Wide Web 
at http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/. 
Introduction 
Today, corpora are considered to be 
indispensable to NLP work: they provide 
information for the creation of other resources 
(e.g., lexicons), enable the gathering of 
statistics on real-language use to inform 
theories and algorithms, and provide the raw 
materials for testing and training. Their 
importance is widely acknowledged: the 
creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC) in the United States and the European 
Language Resources Association (ELRA) in 
Europe shows the commitment of funding 
agencies on both sides of the Atlantic to 
gathering and distributing corpora for research 
use .  
In addition to creating large-scale corpora, it is 
also necessary to develop standards for their 
encoding, in order to ensure their usability and, 
most importantly, reusability in corpus-based 
NLP work. Many freely available tools for 
language-related tasks such as segmentation, 
part of speech tagging, etc., exist, and even 
more in-house tools exist in labs and research 
centers. Input and output formats for these 
tools are rarely, if ever, compatible with each 
other, nor with the encoding formats in 
available corpora. Translation among formats 
is not a matter of simple transduction: 
sometimes the information needed by a tool 
does not exist in the data; sometimes it is not 
unambiguously translatable; sometimes the 
tool cannot retain information present in the 
original data and it is lost in processing. As a 
result, enormous amounts of research time and 
effort are currently spent massaging data and 
tools for compatibility. This in itself motivates 
establishing common encoding formats, to 
avoid redundant effort. This need has been 
acknowledged in Europe for several years, 
through efforts such as EAGLES. Recently, 
recognizing the amount of time and effort 
involved in creating and annotating corpora, 
this need has gained the attention of North 
American researchers and funders as well (see, 
in particular, the conclusions of an NSF- 
sponsored international workshop on the 
future directions of NLP research \[Hovy and 
Ire, 1998\]). 
Designing a coherent encoding scheme is by 
no means trivial. It demands, first, the 
development of a sound model of the data to 
be represented and all its relevant features and 
attributes, as well as their structural, logical, 
linguistic, etc. relationships; together with 
consideration of processing needs). The format 
should provide for incremental encoding, 
allowing for enhancement of data with various 
kinds of annotation. Very few encoding 
formats have been designed with such 
considerations in view, resulting in the 
proliferation of a variety of encoding schemes 
(even within a common SGML/XML 
framework) which are, all too often, poorly 
designed and ultimately unsuitable for 
extensive use. 
This paper describes the motivation and design 
of the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) (Ide, 
et al, (1996); Ide, 1998), an enccding 
standard for linguistic corpora intended to 
meet the need for the principled development 
of standardized encoding practices for 
linguistic orpora. The CES was initiated within 
the European projects EAGLES (in particular, 
the EAGLES Text Representation subgroup) 
and Multext (EU-LRE), together with the 
Vassar/CNRS collaboration (supported by the 
U.S. National Science Foundation). The CES 
has so far been used in several pan-European 
corpus encoding projects, including PAROLE ~ 
and TELRI ~, as well as numerous smaller 
projects in both Europe and North America, 
and it has recently been adopted as a basis for 
the TIPSTER document attributes and 
annotation s . 
1 Goa ls  
The CES is an application of SGML ~ (ISO 
8879:1986, Information Processing--Text and 
Office Systems--Standard Generalized Markup 
Language), conformant to the TEl Guidelines 
for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange 
(Sperberg-McQueen a d Burnard, 1994). The 
CES is designed for encoding corpora used as 
a resource across a broad range of language 
processing applications, including machine 
translation, information retrieval and 
extraction, lexicography, etc. Corpora are used 
primarily in these applications to gather real 
language evidence, both qualitative and 
quantitative; therefore the CES is designed to 
enable the common operations such as 
extraction of sub-corpora; sophisticated search 
and retrieval (e.g., collocation extraction, 
concordance generation, generation of lists of 
lingui.stic elements, etc.); and the generation of 
statistics (frequency information, averages, 
mutual information scores, etc.). 
The design of the CES is motivated by three 
overall goals: 
? to provide encoding specifications that 
include elements relevant to language 
processing work and reflect best practice in 
the field, and that are both flexible enough 
to accommodate he range of current use 
and precise enough to provide clear 
guidelines for encoders and annotators; 
? to minimize the costs of corpus creation, 
annotation, and use;

4 The CES is currently being updated for conformance 
to XML (The Extensible Markup Language). 
? to provide specifications that ensure the 
maximum of usability and reusability with 
corpus-processing software and in 
integrated platforms. 
Each of these goals is discussed more fully 
below. A full treatment of the CES encoding 
principles and goals can be found in Ide and 
V6ronis (1993)and in the CES documentation 
(Ide, et al, 1996). 
1.1 Meet ing  the  needs  o f  corpus -  
based  work  
1.1.1 Adaptation of the TEl Guidelines 
The CES uses the TEI scheme as a starting 
point. However, the TEl Guidelines are 
designed to be applicable across a broad range 
of applications and disciplines and therefore 
treat a vast array of textual phenomena beyond 
what is needed for a particular application. 
Therefore, the CES limits the TEl scheme to 
include only the sub-set of the TEl tagset 
relevant for corpus-based work. The CES also 
makes choices among TEl encoding options, 
constraining or simplifying the TEl 
specifications as appropriate; for example: 
? element content models are substantially 
simplified, in order to maximize the ability 
to validate 5 encoded ocuments; 
? attributes and attribute values are 
constrained or extended to serve the needs 
of corpus-based applications; 
? the TEl element and attribute class strategy 
is  adopted, but the classes are simplified to 
form a shallow hierarchy with no overlaps; 
? the TEl Guidelines are extended to meet 
the specific needs of corpus-based work; in 
particular: 
addition of elements and DTD 
fragments for areas not covered by the 
TEl (e.g., detailed encoding of 
morpho-syntactic annotation) 
specification of precise values for some 
attributes 
specification of required, 
recommended, and optional elements 
to be marked 
detailed semantics for elements relevant 
to language ngineering (e.g., sentence, 
word, etc.) 
10 
s Validation is the process by which software checks 
that the formal specifications of a Document Type 
Definition (DTD), which is a BNF description of legal 
tag syntaxare adhered toin a document's markup (e.g., 
tags are properly nested, appear in the correct order, 
contain all required tags; attributes appear when and 
only when they should, have valid values; etc.). 
Beyond this common basis, the CES diverges 
from the TEI in two major ways: first, in its 
data architecture and supporting set of DTDs 
(as opposed to the single, encompassing TEl 
DTD); and second, in its overall design 
philosophy. The TEl began development over 
ten years ago, when very few encoded texts 
existed; as a result, the TEl Guidelines were 
developed in large part in the absence of prior 
experience and practice. Given the benefit of 
the TEl experience and the initiation of many 
corpus-encoding projects over the past ten 
years, the CES can approach the development 
of a standard for encoding linguistic corpora 
from a different perspective. In particular, the 
CES is being developed incrementally, 
evolving as consensus and best practice emerge 
within the community. Accordingly, the CES 
so far includes specifications for basic 
document structure, sentences, words, and 
several other sub-paragraph elements, as well as 
encoding conventions for incorporating part of 
speech and alignment information. We are 
working on extending the CES for additional 
kinds of markup (terminology, speech, 
discourse, lexicons, etc.), but we rely on user 
input and established practice for continued 
development of the scheme. 
1.1.2 Guidelines for encoding legacy data 
Most data encoded for NLP work is adapted 
from legacy data, that is, pre-existing electronic 
data encoded in some arbitrary format 
(typically, word processor, typesetter, etc. 
formats intended for printing). This process, 
called up-translation, involves translating 
existing encoding, that describes the printed 
presentation of the text (e.g., font shifts, page 
breaks, etc.) into an encoding which is suitable 
as a basis for general use. The resulting 
encoding uses descriptive markup to identify 
the logical and structural parts of a text. 
Because up-translation is common and costly, 
the CES provides guidelines for the process. 
In general, it is descriptive markup that is 
important for corpus-based research, and 
information about rendition in a printed 
original can or even must be ignored. For 
example, if the abbreviation for "number" 
(No.) is rendered sometimes with a 
superscripted "o" and sometimes not, a search 
on a document that retains the text in its 
original rendition will not identify the two as 
instances of the same linguistic element. 
However, for some applications it is necessary 
to retain certain information about printed 
rendering (e.g., in machine translation, where 
the resulting translated text must be rendered 
in the same fonts, etc.--but obviously not with 
the same line breaks--as the original). 
Therefore, the CES recommends retaining 
rendition information when it is cost-free or 
when it is required, but provides means to 
retain it while appropriately representing the 
content for the purposes of search and 
retrieval. 
1.2 M in imiz ing  costs  
1.2.1 Minimizing creation costs 
The minimization of the costs of corpus 
creation is a primary goal of the CES. The vast 
quantities of data involved and the difficulty 
(and cost) of up-translation i to usable formats 
dictate that the CES be designed in such a way 
that this translation does not require 
prohibitively large amounts of manual 
intervention to achieve minimum conformance 
to the standard. However, the markup that is 
most desirable for the linguist is not achievable 
by fully automatic means. Therefore, a major 
feature of the CES is the provision for a series 
of increasingly refined encodings of text, 
beyond the minimum requirements. 
The first level of encoding is the minimum 
level required to make the corpus (re)usable 
across all possible language processing 
applications. Encoding at this level includes 
elements often signalled by typography in the 
original (e.g., paragraph breaks) and is 
therefore achievable by fairly inexpensive, 
automated means. Successive ncoding levels 
provide for increasing enhancement in the 
amount of encoded information and increasing 
precision in the identification of text elements. 
Automatic methods to achieve markup at each 
level are for the most part increasingly 
complex, and therefore more costly; the 
sequence is designed to accommodate a series 
of increasingly information-rich instantiations 
of the text at a minimum of cost. Section 3 
outlines the precise requirements for each level 
of encoding defined by the CES. 
1.2.2 Minimizing processing costs 
The CES is also designed based on processing 
considerations and needs, such as the overhead 
of use of SGML mechanisms (e.g., entity 
replacement, use of optional features), as well 
as more complex textual phenomena such as 
linkage among elements and related 
information (for example, annotation, phonetic 
gloss, etc.), which can have more serious 
implications for processing (e.g., the use of 
inter-textual pointers demands that the entire 
corpus be available at all times for processing). 
It also considers processing demands of end- 
11 
use, such as the ability to (efficiently) select 
texts according to user-specified criteria, etc. 
1.2.3 A data architecture for corpus 
representation 
There are additional problems involved in 
allowing for the simultaneous representation 
of, and selected access to, multiple views of a 
document, whereby it may be seen as a logical 
structure, a rhetorical structure, a linguistic 
object, a document database, etc., all of which 
are potentially conflicting in terms of well- 
formed, hierarchical markup. The CES 
addresses this problem as well as several others 
by defining a data architecture for corpora in 
which annotation information is not merged 
with the original, but rather retained in separate 
SGML documents (with different DTDs) and 
linked to the original or other annotation 
documents. This is opposed to the classical 
view of a document prepared for use in 
corpus-based research, in which annotation is 
added incrementally to the original as it is 
generated. The separation of original data and 
annotation is consistent with other recently 
developed ata architecture models, such as the 
TIPSTER model. 
The separate markup strategy is in essence a 
finely linked hypertext format where the links 
signify a semantic role rather than navigational 
options. That is, the links signify the locations 
where markup contained in a given annotation 
document would appear in the document o 
which it is linked. As such the annotation 
information comprises remote markup which is 
virtually added to the document o which it is 
linked. In principle, the two documents could 
be merged to form a single document 
containing all the markup in each. This 
approach has several advantages for corpus- 
based research: 
? the base document may be read-only 
and/or very large, so copying it to 
introduce markup may be unacceptablei 
? the markup may include multiple 
.overlapping hierarchies; 6 
? ~t may be desirable to associate alternative 
annotations (e.g., part-of-speech 
annotation using several different schemes, 
or representing different phases of 
analysis) with the base document; 
? it avoids the creation of  potentially 
unwieldy documents; 
6 For example, lines and sentences in ~rty ,  
transcriptions of multi-party dialogues, multi-media 
corpora, etc. 
distribution of the base document may be 
controlled, but the markup is freely 
available. 
2 CES  Overv iew 
The development of the CES involves the 
following steps: (1) analysis of the needs of 
corpus-based NLP research, both in terms of 
the kinds and degree of annotation required 
and the requirements for efficient processing, 
accessibility, etc.; and (2) analysis of general 
properties and configuration of corpora, the 
relevant structural and logical features of 
component text types, and the design of 
encoding mechanisms that can represent all 
required elements and features while 
accommodating the requirements determined 
i n ( l ) .  
The CES applies to monolingual corpora 
including texts from a variety of western and 
eastern European languages, as well as multi- 
lingual corpora and parallel corpora 
comprising texts in any of these languages. 
The term "corpus" here refers to any collection 
of linguistic data, whether or not it is selected 
or structured according to some design criteria. 
According to this definition, a corpus can 
potentially contain any text type, including not 
only prose, newspapers, as well as poetry, 
drama, etc., but also word lists, dictionaries, etc. 
The CES is also intended to cover transcribed 
spoken data. 
The CES distinguishes primary data, which is 
"unannotated" data in electronic form, most 
often originally created for non-linguistic 
purposes uch as publishing, broadcasting, etc.; 
and linguistic annotation, which comprises 
information generated and added to the 
primary data as a result of some linguistic 
analysis. The CES covers the encoding of 
objects in the primary data that are seen to be 
relevant to corpus-based work in language 
engineering research and applications, 
including: 
(1) Document-wide markup: 
bibliographic description of the 
document, encoding description, etc. 
(2) Gross structural markup: 
- structural units of text, such as volume, 
chapter, etc., down to the level of 
paragraph; also footnotes, titles, headings, 
tables, figures, etc. 
- normalization to recommended character 
sets and entities 
(3) Markup for sub-paragraph structures: 
- sentence.s, quotations 
- words 
12 
- abbreviations, names, dates, terms, cited 
words, etc. 
In addition, the CES covers encoding 
conventions for linguistic annotation of text 
and speech, currently including morpho- 
syntactic tagging and parallel text alignment. 
We intend to extend the CES in the near future 
to cover speech annotation, including prosody, 
phonetic transcription, alignment of levels of 
speech analysis, etc.; discourse elements; 
terminology; and lexicon encoding. 
Markup types (2) and (3) above include text 
elements down to the level of paragraph, which 
is the smallest unit that can be identified 
language-independently, as well as sub- 
paragraph structures which are usually signaled 
(sometimes ambiguously) by typography in 
the text and which are language-dependent. 
Document-wide markup and markup for 
linguistic annotation provide "extra-textual" 
information: the former provides information 
about the provenance, form, content and 
encoding of the text, and the latter enriches the 
text with the results of some linguistic analysis. 
As such, both add information about the text 
rather than identify constituent elements. 
The CES is intended to cover those areas of 
corpus encoding on which there exists 
consensus among the language engineering 
community, or on which consensus can be 
easily achieved. Areas where no consensus can 
be reached (for example, sense tagging) are 
not treated at this time. 
3 Leve ls  of  C o n f o r m a n c e  
The CES provides a TEI-conformant 
Document Type Definition (DTD) for three 
levels of encoding for primary data together 
with its documentation (the "cesDoc DTD"): 
Level 1 : the minimum encoding level 
required for CES conformance, requiring 
markup for gross document structure (major 
text divisions), down to the level o f  the 
paragraph. Specifically, the following must be 
fulfilled: 
? The document validates against he cesDoc 
DTD, using an SGML parser such as sgmls. 
? The header provides a full description of 
all encoding formats utilized in the 
document. 
? The document does not contain foreign 
markup. 
? CES-conformant encoding to the 
paragraph level is included. However, note 
that for Level 1 CES conformance, 
paragraph-level markup need not be 
refined. For example, via automatic means 
all carriage returns may be changed to <p> 
(paragraph) tags; identification of instances 
where the carriage return signals a list, a 
long quote, etc. is not required. 
It is also recommended that there should be no 
information loss for sub-paragraph elements. 
Sub-paragraph elements identified in the 
original by special typography not directly 
representable in the SGML encoded version 
(e.g., distinction by font such as italics, vs. 
distinction by capital letters or quote marks, 
which is directly representable in the encoded 
version) should be marked, typically using a 
<hi> ("highlighted") tag. 
Leve l  2 : requires that paragraph level elements 
are correctly marked, and (where possible) the 
function of rendition information at the sub- 
paragraph level is determined and elements 
marked accordingly. Specific requirements 
are: 
? The requirements for a Level 1 document 
are satisfied. 
? If a sub-paragraph element is marked, 
every occurrence of that element has been 
identified and marked in the text. 
? SGML entities replace all special characters 
(e.g., &mdash;, &pound;, etc.). 
? Quotation marks are removed and either 
replaced by appropriate standard SGML 
entities, or represented in a rend attribute 
on a <q> or <quote> tag. 
? The document validates against he cesDoc 
DTD, using an SGML parser such as sgmls. 
It is further recommended that all paragraph 
level elements (lists, quotes, etc.) are correctly 
identified, and, where possible, <hi> tags are 
resolved to more precise tags (foreign, term, 
etc.) 
Level 3 : the most restrictive and refined level 
of markup for primary data. It places 
additional constraints on the encoding of s- 
units and quoted dialogue, and demands more 
sub-paragraph level tagging. Conformance to 
this level demands: 
? Requirements for a Level 2 document are 
satisfied. 
? All paragraph level elements (lists, quotes, 
etc.) are correctly identified 
? Where possible, <hi> tags are resolved to 
more precise tags (foreign, term, etc.) 
? The following sub-paragraph elements 
have been identified and marked (either 
with explicit tags such as <abbr>, <num.>, 
etc. or with user-defined morpho-syntactic 
tags. 
- abbreviations 
- numbers 
- names 
- foreign words and phrases 
13 
? Where s-units and dialogue are tagged:, the 
<p> - <s> - <q> hierarchy mus~t be 
followed. 
? The encoding for all elements including 
and below the level of the paragraph has 
been validated for a I0 percent sample of 
the text. Note: this does not include 
morpho-syntactic agging, if present. 
? The document validates against he cesDoc 
DTD, using an SGML parser such as sgmls. 
4 Data Architecture 
The CES adopts a strategy whereby annotation 
information is not merg.ed with the original, 
but rather retained m separate SGML 
documents (with different DTDs) and linked to 
the original or other annotation documents. 
Linkage between original and annotation 
documents is accomplished using the TEl 
addressing mechanisms for element linkage. 
The CES linkage specifications are currently 
being updated to conform to XML (Mater & 
DeRose, 1998). 
The hyper-document comprising each text in 
the corpus and its annotations consists Of 
several documents. The base or "hub" 
document is the unannotated document 
containing only primary data markup. The 
hub document is "read only" and is not 
modified in the annotation process. Each 
annotation document is a proper SGML 
document with a DTD, containing annotation 
information linked to its appropriate location 
in the hub document or another annotation 
document. 
All annotation documents are linked to the 
SGML original (containing the primary data) 
or other annotation documents using one-way 
links. The exception is output of the aligner 
for parallel texts, which consists of an SGML 
document containing only two-way links 
associating locations in two documents in 
different languages. The two linked documents 
are two documents containing the relevant 
structural information, such as sentence or 
word boundaries. The overall architecture is 
given in Figure 1. 
5 The  CES DTDs  
Because the CES is an application of SGML, 
document structure is defined using a context 
free grammar in a document ype definition 
(DTD). At present, the CES provides three 
different TEI customizafions, each instantiated 
using the TEI.2 DTD and the appropriate TEI 
customization files, for use with different 
documents. For convenience, a version of each 
of these three TEI instanfiations i provided as 
a stand-alone DTD, together with a means to 
browse the element tree as a hypertext 
document.

Figure 1. CES data architecture 
S .1  The cesDoc DTD 
The cesDoc DTD is used to encode primary 
documents, including texts with gross structural 
markup only to texts heavily and consistently 
marked for elements of relevance for corpus- 
based work. It defines the required structure 
for marking Level 1 conformant documents 
down to the paragraph level. It also defines 
additional elements at the sub-paragraph level 
which may appear, but are not required, in a 
Level 1 encoding, and which are used in Level 
2 and Level 3 encodings. 
There are five mare categories of sub- 
paragraph elements: 
? linguistic elements; 
? elements indicating editorial changes to the 
original text; 
? the <.h.i> element for marking 
typographically distinct words or phrases, 
especially when the purpose of the 
highlighting is not yet determined; 
? elements for identifying s-units (typically 
orthographic sentences) and quoted 
dialogue; 
? elements for pointing and reference. 
There have been two main defining forces 
behind the choice of linguistic elements: 
(1) the needs of corpus-annotation tools, such 
as morpho-syntactic taggers, whose 
performance can often be improved by 
pre-identification of elements such as 
14 
names, addresses, title, dates, measures, 
foreign words and phrases, etc. 
(2) the need to identify objects which have 
intrinsic linguistic interest, or are often 
useful for the purposes of translation, text 
alignment, etc., such as abbreviations, 
names, terms, linguistically distinct words 
and phrases, etc. 
The CES documentation provides an informal 
semantics for tags used in the cesDoc DTD, 
especially sub-paragraph linguistic elements. 
For example, the CES provides precise 
description of the textual phenomena that 
should be marked with <name> tags (e.g., do not 
tag laws named after people, etc.). The 
documentation also includes specifications for 
the format of such encoding. For example, 
titles and roles (e.g., "President" in "President 
Clinton) should not be included inside the 
<name> tag, punctuation not a part of the name 
is not enclosed in the <name> tag (e.g., 
"President <name type=person> 
Clinton</name>,"), etc. In addition, precise rules 
for handling punctuation in abbreviations, 
sentences, quotations, as well as apostrophes, 
etc., are provided, as well as a hierarchical 
referencing system used to generate distinct 
identifiers (SGML id's) for structural elements 
such as chapters, paragraphs, sentences, and 
words. 
In general, the rules for encoding sub- 
paragraph elements are driven by two 
considerations: 
(1) Retrieval: it is essential that items marked 
with like tags in a document represent the same 
kind of object. Therefore, while "Clinton" in a 
phrase such as "President Clinton today said..." 
is marked as a name, it is not marked as a name 
in the phrase "the Clinton doctrine". 
(2) Processing needs: There is a small class of 
tags which mark the presence of tokens that 
have been isolated and classified by the 
encoder, e.g., abbreviations, names, dates, 
numbers, terms, etc. For many language 
processing tools, when such an element is 
identified in the input stream, it is not desirable 
to further tokenize the string inside the tag; 
rather, the string inside the tag can be regarded 
as a single token (possibly with the type 
indicated by the tag name). For example, in 
some languages it may be possible for lexical 
lookup routines and morpho-syntactic taggers 
to assume that an element with the tag <name> is 
a single token with the grammatical category 
PROPER NOUN. Therefore, adjectival forms in 
English (e.g., "Estonian") are not marked as 
names; generally, for any language, only 
nouns or noun phrases are marked as names. 
Similarly, for language processing purposes 
"Big Brother" can be regarded as a single token 
instead of two distinct tokens; if marked with a 
<name> tag, processing software may opt to 
avoid further tokenization of the marked 
entity. Based on this possibility, punctuation 
that is not a part of the token is not included 
inside the tag; in English, possessives are 
marked by placing the "%" outside the tag, etc. 
The CES recommends that linguistic 
annotation be encoded in a separate SGML 
document with its own DTD, which is linked to 
the primary data. However, for some 
applications it is still desirable to retain 
morpho-syntactic annotation in the same 
SGML document as the primary data. 
Therefore, the CES provides means to 
accomplish this in-file tagging. To implement 
it, a pre-defined module containing all the 
required definitions for the morpho-syntactic 
information is brought in at the beginning of 
the document. 
5 .2  The  cesAna DTD 
The cesAna DTD is used for segmentation a d 
grammatical nnotation, including: 
? sentence boundary markup 
? tokens, each of which consists of the 
following: 
? the orthographic form of the token as it 
appears in the corpus 
? grammatical nnotation, comprising one or 
more sets of the following: 
? the base form (lemma) 
? a morpho-syntactic specification 
? acorpus tag 
Allowing more than one possible set of 
grammatical annotation enables representing 
data for which lexical lookup or some other 
morpho-syntactic analysis has been performed, 
but which has not been disambiguated. When 
disambiguation has been accomplished, an 
optional element can be included containing 
the disambiguated form. 
The structure of the DTD constituents i  based 
on the overall principle that one or more 
"chunks" of a text may be included in the 
annotation document. These chunks may 
correspond to parts of the document extracted 
at different imes for annotation, or simply to 
some subset of the text that has been extracted 
for analysis. For example, it is likely that within 
any text, only the paragraph content will 
undergo morpho-syntactic analysis, and rifles, 
footnotes, captions, long quotations, etc. will be 
omitted or analyzed separately. 
The following example, which shows the 
annotation for the first word ("le" in .French) of 
15 
a primary data document stored in a file called 
"MyTextl", shows the use of many of the 
options provided in the cesAna DTD. This set 
of annotation data could be the final result 
after tokenization, segmentation, lexical lookup 
or morpho-syntactic analysis, and part of 
speech disambiguation. All the original options 
for morpho-syntactic lass are retained here, 
and the disambiguated tag is provided in the 
<ais~b> element.

5.3  The  cesA l ign  DTD 
The cesAlign DTD defines the annotation 
document containing alignment information 
for parallel texts. It consists entirely of llinks 
between the documents that have been aligned. 
Alignment may be between primary data 
documents or between annotation documents 
containing segmentation information for the 
aligned-units (paragraphs, sentences, tokens 
etc.). Alignment may be between two or more 
16 
such documents, which are identified in the 
header of the alignment document. 
The most common situation in aligning 
parallel translations is to align data that 
comprises the content of an entire SGML 
element, such as an <s>, <par>, or <tok> 
element. Especially when the aligned data is 
not in the SGML original document, it is likely 
that the elements to be associated will have id 
attributes by which they can be referenced in 
the alignment document, in order to specify 
the elements to be aligned or "linked". 
Note that when the SGML ID and IDref 
mechanism is used to point from one element 
to another in the same SGML document, the 
SGML parser will validate the references to 
ensure that every IDREF points to a valid ID. 
In the CES, all alignment documents are 
separate from the documents that are being 
aligned, and therefore this validation of IDrefs 
by the SGML parser is lost. However, other 
software may be used to validate cross- 
document references, if necessary. 
The CES provides a simple means to point to 
SGML elements in other SGML documents by 
referring to IDs or any other unique 
identifying attribute on those elements, using 
the xtargets attribute on the <\].ink> element. 
Here is a simple example: 
DOCi: <s id=plsl>According to our survey, 
1988 sales of mineral water and soft 
drinks were much higher than in 
1987, ref lect ing the growing 
popularity of these products.</s> 
<s id=pls2>Cola drink manufacturers 
in part icular achieved above-average 
growth rates. </s> 
<I-- ... --> 
DOC2: <s id=plsl>Quant aux eaux min6rales 
et aux limonades, elles rencontrent 
toujours plus d'adeptes.</s> 
<s id=pls2>En effet, notre sondage fair 
ressort ir  des ventes nettement 
sup6rieures ~ celles de 1987, pour 
les boissons ~ base de cola 
notamment.</s> 
ALIGN DOC : 
<l inkGrp targType=" s'> 
<link xtargets="plsl  ; plsl"> 
<link xtargets='pls2 ; pls2"> 
</l inkGrp>s 
When the data to be linked does not include 
IDs on relevant elements (or for some reason it 
is not desired to use IDrefs for alignment), or 
when the data to be linked is not the entire 
content of an SGML element, it is necessary to 
reference locations in the documents using the 
CES notation, which consists of a combination 
of ESIS tree location and character offset. 
Conc lus ion  
By far the greatest need for the development of
linguistic corpora is to ensure their usability 
and reusability in integrated platforms. This 
demands (at least): 
? the development and use of consistent and 
coherent encoding formats for data 
representation, as well as standardized 
schemes for annotation of linguistic 
information; 
? the development of reusable, integrated 
systems and tool architectures for language 
processing and analysis, including the 
corresponding development of a data 
architecture tobest suit research needs. 
It is imperative that these activities be 
undertaken i  collaboration. For example, an 
encoding format that maximizes processability 
and retrievability must be devised in view of 
the capabilities and architecture of the tools 
that will handle them; similarly, reusable tool 
design must be informed by full knowledge of 
the nature and representation of linguistic 
information, desired processes, etc. 
The development of the CES is an attempt o 
achieve this kind of integration between the 
development of encoding schemes and corpus 
processing and use. Very little study has been 
made to date of the relation between encoding 
conventions and the demands of processing 
and retrieval, despite the fact that with the 
development of digital libraries and web-based 
document delivery, consideration of these 
relationships i critical. The CES is in some 
sense an experiment to develop a principled 
basis for further work on this topic; it is in no 
way intended to be the complete and final 
answer to the problem. Rather, the CES is 
being developed from the bottom-up, by 
starting with a relatively minimal set of 
encoding conventions and successively 
incorporating feedback to enlarge the standard 
as needed by the language processing 
community, and as processing and retrieval 
needs become better understood. Testing of 
the current CES specifications and feedback 
are both invited and encouraged, as well input 
and suggestions concerning the treatment of 
other areas of corpus encoding.
