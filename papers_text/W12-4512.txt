Abstract 
This paper describes a coreference resolution 
system for CONLL 2012 shared task 
developed by HLT_HITSZ group, which 
incorporates rule-based and statistic-based 
techniques. The system performs coreference 
resolution through the mention pair 
classification and linking. For each detected 
mention pairs in the text, a Decision Tree (DT) 
based binary classifier is applied to determine 
whether they form a coreference. This 
classifier incorporates 51 and 61 selected 
features for English and Chinese, respectively. 
Meanwhile, a rule-based classifier is applied to 
recognize some specific types of coreference, 
especially the ones with long distances. The 
outputs of these two classifiers are merged. 
Next, the recognized coreferences are linked to 
generate the final coreference chain. This 
system is evaluated on English and Chinese 
sides (Closed Track), respectively. It achieves 
0.5861 and 0.6003 F1 score on the 
development data of English and Chinese, 
respectively. As for the test dataset, the 
achieved F1 scores are 0.5749 and 0.6508, 
respectively. This encouraging performance 
shows the effectiveness of our proposed 
coreference resolution system. 
1 Introduction 
Coreference resolution aims to find out the 
different mentions in a document which refer to the 
same entity in reality (Sundheim and Beth, 1995; 
Lang et al 1997; Chinchor and Nancy, 1998;). It is 
a core component in natural language processing 
and information extraction.  Both rule-based 
approach (Lee et al 2011) and statistic-based 
approach (Soon et al, 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; 
Bengtson and Roth, 2008; Stoyanov et al, 2009; 
Chen et al 2011) are proposed in coreference 
resolution study. Besides the frequently used 
syntactic and semantic features, the more linguistic 
features are exploited in recent works (Versley, 
2007; Kong et al 2010). 
CoNLL-2012 proposes a shared task, ?Modeling 
multilingual unrestricted coreference in the 
OntoNotes? (Pradhan et al 2012). This is an 
extension of the CoNLL-2011 shared task. The 
task involves automatic anaphoric mention 
detection and coreference resolution across three 
languages including English, Chinese and Arabic. 
HLT_HITSZ group participated in the Closed 
Track evaluation on English and Chinese side. This 
paper presents the framework and techniques of 
HLT_HITSZ system which incorporates both rule-
based and statistic-based techniques. In this system, 
the mentions are firstly identified based on the 
provided syntactic information. The mention pairs 
in the document are fed to a Decision Tree based 
classifier to determine whether they form a 
coreference or not. The rule-based classifiers are 
then applied to recognize some specific types of 
coreference, in particular, the long distance ones. 
Finally, the recognized coreference are linked to 
obtain the final coreference resolution results. This 
system incorporates lexical, syntactical and 
semantic features. Especially for English, WordNet 
is used to provide semantic information of the 
mentions, such as semantic distance and the 
107
category of the mentions and so on. Other than the 
officially provided number and gender data, we 
generated some lexicons from the training dataset 
to obtain the values of some features. This system 
achieves 0.5861 and 0.6003 F1 scores on English 
and Chinese development data, respectively, and 
0.5749 and 0.6508 F1 scores on English and 
Chinese testing data, respectively. The achieved 
encouraging performances show that the proposed 
incorporation of rule-based and statistic-based 
techniques is effective. 
The rest of this report is organized as below. 
Section 2 presents the mention detection. Section 3 
presents the coreference determination and Section 
4 presents the coreference linking. The 
experimental results are given in Section 5 in detail. 
Finally, Section 6 concludes this report. 
2 Mention Detection 
In this stage, the system detects the mentions from 
the text. The pairs of these mentions in one 
document are regarded as the coreference 
candidates. Thus, the high recall is a more 
important target than higher precision for this stage. 
Corresponding to English and Chinese, we adopted 
different detection methods, respectively. 
2.1 Mention Detection - English 
HLT_HITSZ system chooses the marked noun 
phrase (NP), pronouns (PRP) and PRP$ in English 
data as the mentions. The system selects most 
named entities (NE) as the mentions but filter out 
some specific types. Firstly, the NEs which cannot 
be labeled either as NP or NML are filter out 
because there are too cases that the pairs of these 
NEs does not corefer even they are in the same 
form as shown in the training dataset. Second, the 
NEs of ORDINAL, PERCENT and MONEY types 
are filtered because they have very low coreference 
ratio (less than 2%). Furthermore, for the cases that 
NPs overlapping a shorter NP, normally, only the 
longer one are choose. An exception is that if the 
shorter NPs are in parallel structures with the same 
level to construct a longer NP. For example, for a 
NP ?A and B?, ?A?, ?B? and ?A and B? as 
regarded ed as three different mentions.   
2.2 Mention Detection ? Chinese 
HLT_HITSZ system extracts all NPs and PNs as 
the mention candidates. For the NPs have the 
overlaps, we handle them in three ways: 1. For the 
cases that two NPs share the same tail, the longer 
NP is kept and the rest discarded; 2. For cases that 
the longer NP has a NR as its tail, the NPs which 
share the same tail are discarded; 3. In MZ and 
NW folders, they are many mentions nested 
marked as the nested co-referent mentions. The 
system selects the longest NP as mention in this 
stage while the other mention candidates in the 
longest NP will be recalled in the post processing 
stage. 
3 Coreference Determination 
Any pair of two detected mentions in one 
document becomes one coreference candidate. In 
this stage, the classifiers are developed to 
determine whether this pair be a coreference or not. 
During the generation of mention pairs, it is 
observed that linking any two mentions in one 
document as candidates leads to much noises.  The 
statistical observation on the Chinese training 
dataset show that 90% corefered mention pairs are 
in the distance of 10 sentences. Similar results are 
found in the English training dataset while the 
context window is set to 5 sentences. Therefore, in 
this stage, the context windows for generating 
mention pairs as coreference candidates for 
English and Chinese are limited to 5 and 10 
sentences, respectively. 
3.1 The Statistic-based Coreference 
Determination 
The same framework is adopted in the statistical-
based coreference determination for English and 
Chinese, respectively, which is based on a machine 
learning-based statistical classifier and selected 
language-dependent features. Through transfer the 
examples in the training test into feature-valued 
space, the classifier is trained. This binary 
classifier will be applied to determine whether the 
input mention pair be a coreference or not. Here, 
we evaluated three machine learning based 
classifiers including Decision Tree, Support Vector 
Machines and Maximum Entropy on the training 
data while Decision Tree perform the best. Thus, 
DT classifier is selected. Since the annotations on 
the training data from different directory show 
some inconsistence, multiple classifiers 
corresponding to each directory are trained 
individually.  
108
3.1.1 Features - English 
51 features are selected for English coreference 
determination. The features are camped to six 
categories. Some typical features are listed below: 
1. Basic features: 
(1) Syntactic type of the two mentions, 
includes NP, NE, PRP, PRP$. Here, only 
the NPs which do not contain any named 
entities or its head word isn?t a named 
entity are considered as an NP while the 
others are discarded. 
(2) If one mention is a PRP or PRP$, use an 
ID to specify which one it is.  
(3) The sentence distance between two 
mentions. 
(4) Whether one mention is contained by 
another one. 
2. Parsing features: 
(1) Whether two mentions belong to one NP. 
(2) The phrase distance between the two 
mentions.  
(3) The predicted arguments which the two 
mentions belong to. 
3. Named entity related features: 
(1) If both of the two mentions may be 
considered as named entities, whether 
they have the same type. 
(2) If one mention is a common NP or PRP 
and another one can be considered as 
named entity, whether the words of the 
common NP or PRP can be used to refer 
this type of named entity. This knowledge 
is extracted from the training dataset. 
(3) Whether the core words of the two named 
entity type NP match each other.    
4. Features for PRP: 
(1) If both mentions are PRP or PRP$, use an 
ID to show what they are. The PRP$ with 
the same type will be assigned the same 
ID, for example, he, him and his. 
(2) Whether the two mentions has the same 
PRP ID. 
5. Semantic Features: 
(1) Whether the two mentions have the same 
headword. 
(2) Whether the two mentions belong to the 
same type. Here, we use WordNet to get 
three most common sense of each NP and 
compare the type they belong to.  
(3) The semantic distance between two 
mentions. WordNet is used here.  
(4) The natures of the two mentions, including 
number, gender, is human or not, and 
match each other or not. We use WordNet 
and a lexicon extracted from the gender 
and number file here. 
6. Document features: 
(1) How many speakers in this document. 
(2) Whether the mention is the first or the last 
sentence of the document. 
(3) Whether the two mentions are from the 
same speaker. 
3.1.2 Features - Chinese 
There are 61 features adopted in Chinese side. 
Because of the restriction of closed crack, most of 
features use the position and POS information. It is 
mentionable that the ways for calculating the 
features values. For instance, the sentence distance 
is not the real sentence distance in the document. 
For instead, the value is the number of sentences in 
which there are at least one mention between the 
mention pair. This ignores the sentences of only 
modal particles.  
The 61 features are camped into five groups. 
Some example features are listed below. 
1. Basic information: 
(1) The matching degree of two mentions 
(2) The word distance of two mentions 
(3) The sentence distance of two mentions 
2. Parsing information: 
(1) Predicted arguments which the two 
mentions belong to and corresponding 
layers. 
3. POS features 
(1) Whether the mention is NR 
(2) Whether the two mentions are both NR 
and are matched 
4. Semantic features: 
(1) Whether the two mention is related 
(2) Whether the two mentions corefer in the 
history. Since the restriction of closed 
track, we did not use any additional 
semantic resources. Here, we extract the 
co-reference history from the training set 
to obtain some semantic information, such 
as ?NN ??? and ?NN ??? corefered in 
the training data, and they are regarded as 
coreference in the testing data.  
5. Document Features: 
109
(1) Whether the two mentions have the same 
speaker. 
(2) Whether the mention is a human. 
(3) Whether the mention is the first mention in 
the sentence. 
(4) Whether the sentence to which the mention 
belongs to is the first sentence. 
(5) Whether the sentence to which the mention 
belongs to is the second sentence 
(6) Whether the sentence to which the mention 
belongs to is the last sentence 
(7) The number of the speakers in the 
document. 
3.2 The Rule-based Coreference 
Determination 
The rule-based classifier is developed to recognize some 
specific types of coreference and especially, the long 
distance ones.  
3.2.1 Rule-based Classifier - English 
To achieve a high precision, only the mention pairs 
of NE-NE (include NPs those can be considered as 
NE) or NP-NP types with the same string are 
classified here.  
For the NE-NE pair, the classifier identifies their 
NE part from the whole NP, if their strings are the 
same, they are considered as coreference. 
For the NP-NP pair, the pairs satisfy the 
following rules are regarded as coreference. 
(1) The POS of the first word isn?t ?JJR? or ?JJ?. 
(2) If NP has only one word, its POS isn?t ?NNS? 
or ?NNPS?. 
(3) The NP have no word like ?every?, ?every-?, 
?none?, ?no?,  ?any?,  ?some?,  ?each?. 
(4) If the two NP has article, they can?t be both 
?a? or ?an?. 
Additionally, for the PRP mention pairs, only 
?I?, ?me?, ?my? with the same speaker can be 
regarded as coreference. 
3.2.2 Rule-based Classifier - Chinese 
A rule-based classifier is developed to determine 
whether the mention pairs between PNs and 
mentions not PN corefer or not. For instance, the 
mention pairs between the PN ??? which is after a 
comma and the mention which is marked as ARG0 
in the same sentence. In the sentence ?????? 
??  ?  ?  ??  ??  ??  ??  ?  ???, 
because the mention pair between ??????? 
and the first ??? match the mentioned above rule, 
it  is classified as a positive one. The result on the 
development set shows that the rule-based 
classifier brings good improvement. 
4 Coreference Chain Construction  
4.1 Coreference Chain Construction-English 
The evaluation on development data shows that the 
achieved precision of our system is better than 
recall.  Thus, in this stage, we simply link every 
pair of mentions together if there is any links can 
link them together to generate the initial 
coreference chain. After that, the mentions have 
the distance longer than 5 sentences are observed. 
The NE-NE or NP-NP mention pairs between one 
known coreference and an observing mention with 
long distance are classified to determine they are 
corefered or not by using a set of rules. The new 
detected conference will be linked to the initial 
coreference chain.  
4.2 Coreference Chain Construction-Chinese 
The coreference chain construction for Chinese is 
similar to English. Furthermore, as mentioned 
above, in MZ and NW folders, there are many 
mentions nested marked as the nested co-
referenced mentions. In this stage, HLT_HITSZ 
system generates the nested co-reference mentions 
for improving the analysis for these two folders. 
Additionally, the system uses some rules to 
improve the coreference chain construction. We 
find that the trained classifier performs poor in co-
reference resolution related to Pronoun. So, most  
rules adopted here are related to these Pronouns: 
????, ???, ???, ???, ???, ????, ????, 
???. We use these rules to bridge the chain of 
pronouns and the chain of other type. 
Although high precision for NT co-reference 
cases are achieved through string matching, the 
recall is not satisfactory. It partially attributes to 
the fact that the flexible use of Chinese. For 
example, to express the year of 1980, we found 
???????, ??????, ? ?????, ???
? ?, ?1980 ? ?. Similar situation happens for 
month (?, ??) and day (?,?), we conclude 
most situations to several templates to improve the 
rule-based conference resolution.

English and Chinese are given in Table 5 and Table 6, 
respectively. It is shown that the OF performance drops 
0.0309(Gold) and 0.0112(Auto) from development 
dataset to test dataset on English, respectively. On the 
contrary, the OF performance increases 0.0096(Gold) 
and 0.0505(Auto) from development dataset to test 
dataset on Chinese, respectively. Compared with the 
performance reported in CoNLL2012 shared task, our 
system achieves a good result, ranked 3rd, on Chinese.

6 Conclusions 
This paper presents the HLT_HITSZ system for 
CoNLL2012 shared task. Generally speaking, this 
system uses a statistic-based classifier to handle 
short distance coreference resolution and uses a 
rule-based classifier to handle long distance cases. 
The incorporation of rule-based and statistic-based 
techniques is shown effective to improve the 
performance of coreference resolution. In our 
future work, more semantic and knowledge bases 
will be incorporated to improve coreference 
resolution in open track.
