Abstract 
This paper describes the latest version of the 
ATEC metric for automatic MT evaluation, 
with parameters optimized for word choice 
and word order, the two fundamental features 
of language that the metric relies on. The 
former is assessed by matching at various 
linguistic levels and weighting the informa-
tiveness of both matched and unmatched 
words. The latter is quantified in term of 
word position and information flow. We also 
discuss those aspects of language not yet 
covered by other existing evaluation metrics 
but carefully considered in the formulation of 
our metric.  
1 Introduction 
It is recognized that the proposal of the BLEU 
metric (Papineni et al, 2002) has piloted a para-
digm evolution to MT evaluation. It provides a 
computable solution to the task and turns it into 
an engineering problem of measuring text simi-
larity and simulating human judgments of trans-
lation quality. Related studies in recent years 
have extensively revealed more essential charac-
teristics of BLEU, including its strengths and 
weaknesses. This has aroused the proposal of 
different new evaluation metrics aimed at ad-
dressing such weaknesses so as to find some oth-
er hopefully better alternatives for the task. Ef-
fort in this direction brings up some advanced 
metrics such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 
2005) and TERp (Snover et al, 2009) that seem 
to have already achieved considerably strong 
correlations with human judgments. Nevertheless, 
few metrics have really nurtured our understand-
ing of possible parameters involved in our lan-
guage comprehension and text quality judgment. 
This inadequacy limits, inevitably, the applica-
tion of the existing metrics. 
The ATEC metric (Wong and Kit, 2008) was 
developed as a response to this inadequacy, with 
a focus to account for the process of human 
comprehension of sentences via two fundamental 
features of text, namely word choice and word 
order. It integrates various explicit measures for 
these two features in order to provide an intuitive 
and informative evaluation result. Its previous 
version (Wong and Kit, 2009b) has already illu-
strated a highly comparable performance to the 
few state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, showing 
a great improvement over its initial version for 
participation in MetricsMATR081. It is also ap-
plied to evaluate online MT systems for legal 
translation, to examine its applicability for lay 
users? use to select appropriate MT systems 
(Wong and Kit, 2009a). 
In this paper we describe the formulation of 
ATEC, including its new features and optimiza-
tion of parameters. In particular we will discuss 
how the design of this metric can complement 
the inadequacies of other metrics in terms of its 
treatment of word choice and word order and its 
utilization of multiple references in the evalua-
tion process. 
2 The ATEC Metric 
2.1 Word Choice 
In general, word is the basic meaning bearing 
unit of language. In a semantic theory such as 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al, 
1998), lexical selection is even the sole consider-
ation of the meaning of a text. A recent study of 
the major errors in MT outputs by Vilar et al 
(2006) also reveals that different kinds of error 
related to word choices constitute a majority of 
error types. It is therefore of prime importance

for MT evaluation metrics to diagnose the ade-
quacy of word selection by an MT system. 
It is a general consensus that the performance 
of an evaluation metric can be improved by 
matching more words between MT outputs and 
human references. Linguistic resources like 
stemmer and WordNet are widely applied by 
many metrics for matching word stems and syn-
onyms. ATEC is equipped with these two mod-
ules as well, and furthermore, with two measures 
for word similarity, including a WordNet-based 
(Wu and Palmer, 1994) and a corpus-based 
measure (Landauer et al, 1998) for matching 
word pairs of similar meanings. Our previous 
work (Wong, 2010) shows that the inclusion of 
semantically similar words results in a positive 
correlation gain comparable to the use of Word-
Net for synonym identification. 
In addition to increasing the number of legiti-
mate matches, we also consider the importance 
of each match. Although most metrics score 
every matched word with equal weight, different 
words indeed contribute different amount of in-
formation to the meaning of a sentence. In Ex-
ample 1 below, both C1 and C2 contain the same 
number of words matched with Ref, but the 
matches in C1 are more informative and there-
fore should be assigned higher weights. 
 
Example 1 
C1: it was not first time that prime minister con-
fronts northern league ? 
C2: this is not the prime the operation with the 
north ? 
Ref: this is not the first time the prime minister 
has faced the northern league ? 
 
The informativeness of a match is weighted by 
the tf-idf measure, which has been widely used in 
information retrieval to assess the relative impor-
tance of a word as an indexing term for a docu-
ment. A word is more important to a document 
when it occurs more frequently in this document 
and less in others. In ATEC, we have ?document? 
to refer to ?sentence?, the basic text unit in MT 
evaluation. This allows a more sensitive measure 
for words in different sentences, and gets around 
the problem of an evaluation dataset containing 
only one or a few long documents. Accordingly, 
the tf-idf measure is formulated as: 
)log(),( ,
i
ji sf
N
tfjitfidf ?=  
where tfi,j is the occurrences of word wi in sen-
tence sj, sfi the number of sentences containing 
word wi, and N the total number of sentences in 
the evaluation set. In case of a high-frequency 
word whose tf-idf weight is less than 1, it is then 
rounded up to 1. 
In addition to matched words, unmatched 
words are also considered to have a role to play 
in determining the quality of word choices of an 
MT output. As illustrated in Example 1, the un-
matched words in Ref for C1 and C2 are [this | is 
| the | the | has | faced | the] and [first | time | mi-
nister | has | faced | northern | league] respective-
ly. One can see that the words missing in C2 are 
more significant. It is therefore necessary to ap-
ply the tf-idf weighting to unmatched reference 
words so as to quantify the information missed in 
the MT outputs in question.  
2.2 Word Order 
In MT evaluation, word order refers to the extent 
to which an MT output is interpretable following 
the information flow of its reference translation. 
It is not rare that an MT output has many 
matched words but does not make sense because 
of a problematic word order. Currently it is ob-
served that consecutive matches represent a legi-
timate local ordering, causing some metrics to 
extend the unit of matching from word to phrase. 
Birch et al (2010) show, however, that the cur-
rent metrics including BLEU, METEOR and 
TER are highly lexical oriented and still cannot 
distinguish between sentences of different word 
orders. This is a serious problem in MT evalua-
tion, for many MT systems have become capable 
of generating more and more suitable words in 
translations, resulting in that the quality differ-
ence of their outputs lies more and more crucial-
ly in the variances of word order.  
ATEC uses three explicit features for word or-
der, namely position distance, order distance and 
phrase size. Position distance refers to the diver-
gence of the locations of matches in an MT out-
put and its reference. Example 2 illustrates two 
candidates with the same match, whose position 
in C1 is closer to its corresponding position in 
Ref than that in C2. We conceive this as a signif-
icant indicator of the accuracy of word order: the 
closer the positions of a matched word in the 
candidate and reference, the better match it is. 
 
Example 2 
C1: non-signatories these acts victims but it 
caused to incursion transcendant 
C2: non-signatories but it caused to incursion 
transcendant these acts victims 
Ref: there were no victims in this incident but 
they did cause massive damage 
361
The calculation of position distance is based 
on the position indices of words in a sentence. In 
particular, we align every word in a candidate to 
its closest counterpart in a reference. In Example 
3, all the candidate words have a match in the 
reference. As illustrated by the two ?a? in the 
candidate, the shortest alignments (strict lines) 
are preferred over any farther alternatives (dash 
lines). In a case like this, only two matches, i.e., 
thief and police, vary in position by a distance of 
3. 
 
Example 3 
Candidate: a thief chases a police 
Pos distance:        0     3         0      0      3 
Pos index: 1    2         3      4      5  
 
Reference: a police chases a thief 
Pos index: 1     2         3        4       5  
 
This position distance is sensitive to sentence 
length as it simply makes use of word position 
indices without any normalization. Example 4 
illustrates two cases of different lengths. The po-
sition distance of the bold matched words is 3 in 
C1 but 14 in C2. Indeed, the divergence of word 
order in C1 does not hinder our understanding, 
but in C2 it poses a serious problem. This exces-
sive length inevitably magnifies the interference 
effect of word order divergence. 
 
Example 4 
C1: Short1 and2 various3 international4 news5 
R1: International1 news2 brief3 
C2: Is1 on2 a3 popular4 the5 very6 in7 Iraq8 to9

Another feature, the order distance, concerns 
the information flow of a sentence in the form of 
the sequence of matches. Each match in a candi-
date and a reference is first assigned an order 
index in a sequential manner. Then, the differ-
ence of two counterpart indices is measured, so 
as to see if a variance exists. Examples 5a and 5b 
exemplify two kinds of order distance and their 
corresponding position distance. Both cases have 
two matches with the same sum of position dis-
tance. However, the matches are in an identical 
sequence in 5a but cause a cross in 5b, resulting 
in a larger order distance for the latter.

(2-2) + (3-1) = 2 
(2-1) + (2-1) = 2 
 
In practice, ATEC operates on phrases like 
many other metrics. But unlike these metrics that 
count only the number of matched phrases, 
ATEC gives extra credit to a longer phrase to 
reward its valid word sequence. In Example 6, 
C1 and C2 represent two MT outputs of the same 
length, with matched words underlined. Both 
have 10 matches in 3 phrases, and will receive 
the same evaluation score from a metric like 
METEOR or TERp, ignoring the subtle differ-
ence in the sizes of the matched phrases, which 
are [8,1,1] and [4,3,3] words for C1 and C2 re-
spectively. In contrast, ATEC uses the size of a 
phrase as a reduction factor to its position dis-
tance, so as to raise the contribution of a larger 
phrase to the metric score.  
 
Example 6 
C1: w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 w11 w12 w13 
C2: w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 w11 w12 w13 
2.3 Multiple References 
The availability of multiple references allows 
more legitimate word choices and word order of 
an MT output to be accounted. Some existing 
metrics only compute the scores of a candidate 
against each reference and select the highest one. 
362
This deficit can be illustrated by a well-known 
example from Papineni et al (2002), as repli-
cated in Example 7 with slight modification. It 
shows that nearly all candidate words can find 
their matches in either reference. However, if we 
resort to single reference, only around half of 
them can have a match, which would seriously 
underrate the quality of the candidate.  
 
Example 7 
C:   It is a guide to action which ensures that the 
military always obeys the commands of the 
party. 
 
R1: It is a guide to action that ensures that the 
military will forever heed Party commands. 
 
R2: It is the guiding principle which guarantees 
the military forces always being under the 
commands of the party. 
 
ATEC exploits multiple references in this fa-
shion to maximize the number of matches in a 
candidate. It begins with aligning the longest 
matches with either reference. The one with the 
shortest position distance is preferred if more 
than one alternative available in the same phrase 
size. This process repeats until no more candi-
date word can find a match. 
2.4 Formulation of ATEC 
The computation of an ATEC score begins with 
alignment of phrases, as described above. For 
each matched phase, we first sum up the score of 
each word i in the phrase as 
?
?
?=
}{
)(
phrasei i
match
typematch tfidf
Info
wW  
where wtype refers to a basic score of a matched 
word depending on its match type. It is then 
minus its information load, i.e., the tf-idf score of 
the matched word with a weight factor, Infomatch. 
There is also a distance penalty for a phrase, 
orderorder
e
pospos diswc
p
diswDis +?= )
||
||
1(
 ,
 
where dispos and disorder refer to the position 
distance and order distance, and wpos and worder 
are their corresponding weight factors, 
respectively. The position distance is further 
weighted according to the size of phrase |p| with 
an exponential factor e, in proportion to the 
length of candidate |c|.  
The score of a matched phrase is then 
computed by 
??
?
?
?=

,
DisW
LimitW

dismatch  if  Dis > Wmatch?Limitdis; 
otherwise, 
Limitdis is an upper limit for the distance penalty. 
Accordingly, the score C of all phrases in a can-
didate is  
?
?
=
}{candidatej
jPhraseC
. 
Then, we move on to calculating the informa-
tion load of unmatched reference words Wunmatch, 
approximated as

otherwise, 
LimitInfo is an upper limit for the information

Finally, the ATEC score is computed using the 
conventional F-measure in terms of precision P 
and recall R as

The parameter ? adjusts the weights of P and R, 
and |c| and |r| refer to the length of candidate and 
reference, respectively. In the case of multiple 
references, |r| refers to the average length of ref-
erences. 
We have derived the optimized values for the 
parameters involved in ATEC calculation using 
the development data of NIST MetricsMATR10 
with adequacy assessments by a simple hill 
climbing approach. The optimal parameter set-
ting is presented in Table 1 below. 
3 Conclusion 
In the above sections we have presented the lat-
est version of our ATEC metric with particular 
emphasis on word choice and word order as two 
fundamental features of language. Each of these 
features contains multiple parameters intended to 
363
have a comprehensive coverage of different tex-
tual factors involved in our interpretation of a 
sentence. The optimal offsetting for the parame-
ters is expected to report an empirical observa-
tion of the relative merits of each factor in ade-
quacy assessment. We are currently exploring 
their relation with the errors of MT outputs, to 
examine the potential of automatic error analysis.
