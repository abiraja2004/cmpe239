Abstract 
This paper presents a word-pair (WP) 
identifier that can be used to resolve 
homonym/segmentation ambiguities 
and perform syllable-to-word (STW) 
conversion effectively for improving 
Chinese input systems. The experi-
ment results show the following: (1) 
the WP identifier is able to achieve to-
nal (syllables with four tones) and 
toneless (syllables without four tones) 
STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%, 
respectively, among the identified 
word-pairs; (2) while applying the WP 
identifier, together with the Microsoft 
input method editor 2003 and an opti-
mized bigram model, the tonal and 
toneless STW improvements of the 
two input systems are 27.5%/18.9% 
and 22.1%/18.8%, respectively. 
1 Introduction 
More than 100 Chinese input methods have been 
developed in the past (Becker 1985, Huang 1985, 
Gu et al 1991, Chung 1993, Kuo 1995, Fu et al
1996, Lee et al 1997, Hsu et al 1999, Chen et 
al. 2000, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002, 
Lee 2003). Their underlying approaches can be 
classified into four types: (1) Optical character 
recognition (OCR) based (Chung 1993), (2) On-
line handwriting based (Lee et al 1997), (3) 
Speech based (Fu et al 1996, Chen et al 2000), 
and (4) Keyboard based consists of phonetic 
and pinyin based (Chang et al 1991, Hsu et al
1993, Hsu 1994, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Lua 
and Gan 1992); arbitrary codes based [Fan et al
1988]; and structure scheme based (Huang 
1985). 
Currently, the most popular method for Chi-
nese input is phonetic and pinyin based, because 
Chinese people are taught to write the corre-
sponding phonetic and pinyin syllables of each 
Chinese character and word in primary school. 
In Chinese, each Chinese character corresponds 
to at least one syllable; and each Chinese word 
can be a mono-syllabic word, such as ??
(mouse)?, a bi-syllabic word, such as ???
(kangaroo)?, or a multi-syllabic word, such as 
????(Mickey mouse).? Although there are 
more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of 
which 5,400 are commonly used), there are only 
about 1,300 distinct syllables. As per (Qiao et al
1984), each Chinese syllable can be mapped 
from 3 to over 100 Chinese characters, with the 
average number of characters per syllable being 
17. According to our computation, the minimum, 
maximum and average numbers f Chinese words 
per syllable-word in MOE-MANDARIN dic-
tionary ????????? (one of most com-
monly-used Chinese dictionaries published by 
the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, its online 
dictionary is at (MOE)) are 1, 22 and 1.5, re-
spectively. Since the size of problem space for 
syllable-to-word conversion is much less than 
that of syllable-to-character conversion, the 
most existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, 
Hsu et al 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al
2002, MSIME) are addressed on syllable-to-
word conversion, not syllable-to-character con-
version. To the research field of Chinese speech 
recognition, the STW conversion is the main 
task of Chinese language processing in typical 
Chinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al
1996, Lee et al 1993, Chien et al 1993, Su et al
1992). 
Conventionally, there are two approaches for 
syllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the lin-
guistic approach based on syntax parsing, se-
9
mantic template matching and contextual infor-
mation (Hsu 1994, Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al
1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) 
the statistical approach based on the n-gram 
models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 
1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al 1996, Ho et al
1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003). 
Although the linguistic approach requires con-
siderable effort in designing effective syntax 
rules, semantic templates or contextual informa-
tion, it is more user-friendly than the statistical 
approach on understanding why such a system 
makes a mistake (Hsu 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002). 
On the other hand, the statistical language model 
(SLM) used in the statistical approach requires 
less effort and has been widely adopted in com-
mercial Chinese input systems. 
According to previous studies (Chung 1993, 
Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao 
et al 2002, Lee 2003), homophone selection and 
syllable-word segmentation are two critical 
problems to the STW conversion in Chinese. 
Incorrect homophone selection and failed sylla-
ble-word segmentation will directly influence 
the STW conversion rate. For example, consider 
the syllable sequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 
guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4? of the sentence 
???(once)??(covet)??(China)?(of)??
(making-wine)?? (technique).? As per the 
MOE-MANDARIN dictionary, the two possible 
syllable-word segmentations (in pinyin) are: 
(F)?yi1/du4ji4/yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4ji
u3/ji4shu4?; and 
(B)?yi1/du4/ji4yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4ji
u3/ji4shu4.? 
(We use the forward (F) and the backward (B) 
longest syllable-word first strategies (Chen et al
1986, Tsai and Hsu 2002), and ?/? to indicate a 
syllable-word boundary). 
Among the above syllable-word segmentations, 
there is an ambiguous syllable-word section: 
/du4ji4/yu2/ (/{??}/{?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,
?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,? ,
?}/); and /du4/ji4yu2/ (/{?,?,?,?,?,?,
?}/{?? ,??}/), respectively. For the am-
biguous syllable-word section, the set of word-
pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese 
words (including bi-syllabic words in the fol-
lowing) and their corresponding word-pair fre-
quencies found in the UDN2001 corpus are: {?
?-??(1), ??-??(1), ??-??(4), ??-
??(1), ??-??(1), ??-??(26), ??-?
?(19)}. The UDN2001 corpus (Tsai and Hsu 
2002) is a collection of 4,539,624 Chinese sen-
tences extracted from whole 2001 articles on the 
United Daily News Website (UDN) in Taiwan. 
For this case, if the word-pair ???(China)-?
?(technique)? with the maximum frequency 26 
is used to be the key word-pair, the set of co-
occurrence word-pairs with the key word-pair 
found in the UDN2001 will be {??-??, ?
?-??, ??-??, ??-??, ??-??}. 
Then, by the key word-pair ???-??? and its 
co-occurrence word-pair set {??-??, ??-
??, ??-??, ??-??, ??-??}, the 
mentioned ambiguous syllable-word section 
(/du4ji4/yu2/ and /du4/ji4yu2/) and the homo-
phone selection of syllable-word /ji4 shu4/ (/{?
?(technique),??(count)}/) of this case can be 
resolved, simultaneously. Thus, the Chinese 
words ??? (once)?, ??? (covet)?, ???
(China)? and ???(technique)? in the syllable 
sequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 
niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4? can then be correctly iden-
tified. If we use the Microsoft Input Method 
Editor 2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) to 
translate the syllables, it will be converted into 
???(once)? (continue)?(to)??(China)?
(of)??(making-wine)??(technique).? As per 
(Gao et al 2002), MSIME is a trigam-like Chi-
nese input system. The two error converted 
words ??(continue)? and ??(to)? are widely 
recognized that unseen event (??-??) and 
over-weighting (?-??) the two major prob-
lems of SLM systems (Fu et al 1996, Gao et al
2002). 
The objective of this study is to illustrate the 
effectiveness of word-pairs for resolving the 
STW conversion for improving the Chinese in-
put systems. We also conduct STW experiments 
to show the tonal and toneless STW accuracies 
of a commercial input product and a bigram 
model can be improved by our word-pair identi-
fier without a tuning process. Here, the ?tonal? 
is to indicate the syllables input with four tones, 
such as ?niang4(?) jiu3(?) ji4(?) shu4(?)?
and the ?toneless? is to indicate the syllables 
input without four tones, such as ?niang(? )
jiu(?) ji(?) shu(?).?

The remainder of this paper is arranged as 
follows. In Section 2, we present a method for 
auto-generating word-pair (AUTO-WP) data-
base from Chinese sentences. Then, we develop 
a word-pair identifier with the WP database to 
effectively resolve homonym and segmentation 
ambiguities of STW conversion on the WP-
related portion in Chinese syllables. In Section 3, 
we present our STW experiment results. Finally, 
in Section 4, we give our conclusions and sug-
gest some future research directions. 
2 Development of Word-Pair Identifier 
The system dictionary of our word-pair identi-
fier is comprised of 155,746 Chinese words 
taken from the MOE-MANDARIN dictionary 
(MOE) and 29,408 unknown words auto-found 
in UDN2001 corpus by a Chinese word auto-
confirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al 2003). 
The system dictionary provides the knowledge 
of words and their corresponding pinyin sylla-
ble-words. The pinyin syllable-words were 
translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such 
as ?????-to-?ji4.?
2.1 Generating the Word-Pair Database 
The steps of our AUTO-WP to auto-discovery 
word-pairs from a given Chinese sentence are as 
below: 
Step 1. Segmentation: Generate the word 
segmentation for a given Chinese sen-
tence by backward maximum matching 
(BMM) techniques (Chen et al 1986) 
with the system dictionary. Take the Chi-
nese sentence ????????(bring 
the military component parts here)? as an 
example. Its BMM  word-segmentation is 
??(get)/??(military)/??(component 
parts)/ ? ? (bring)? and its forward 
maximum matching (FMM) word-
segmentation is ???(a general)/?(use)/ 
?? (component parts)/?? (bring).? 
According to our previous work (Tsai et 
al. 2004), the word segmentation preci-
sion of BMM is about 1% greater than 
that of FMM. 
Step 2. Initial WP set: Extract all the combi-
nations of word-pairs from the word 
segmentations of Step 1 to be the initial 
WP set. For the above case, there are six 
combinations of word-pairs extracted: 
{??/???, ??/???, ??/???, ??
?/???, ???/???, ???/???}. 
Step 3. Final WP set: Select out the word-
pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic 
Chinese words to be the finial WP set. 
For the final WP set, if the word-pair is 
not found in the WP database, insert it 
into the WP database and set its fre-
quency to 1; otherwise, increase its fre-
quency by 1. In the above case, the final 
WP set includes three word-pairs: {???
/???, ???/???, ???/???}.  
By applying our AUTO-WP to the UDN2001 
corpus (the training corpus), totally 25,439,679 
word-pairs were generated. From the generated 
WP database, the frequencies of word-pairs ??
?/???, ???/??? and ???/??? are 1, 
1 and 2, respectively. The frequency of a word-
pair is the number of sentences that contain the 
word-pair with the same word-pair order in the 
training corpus. 
2.2 Word-Pair Identifier 
The algorithm of our WP identifier for a given 
Chinese syllables is as follows: 
Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables. 
Step 2. Generate all possible word-pairs com-
prised of two multi-syllabic Chinese 
words for the input syllables to be the in-
put of Step 3. 
Step 3. Select out the word-pairs that match a 
word-pair in the WP database to be the 
initial WP set, firstly. Then, from the ini-
tial WP set, select the word-pair with 
maximum frequency as the key word-pair. 
Finally, find the co-occurrence word-
pairs with the key word-pair in the train-
ing corpus to be the final WP set. If there 
are two or more word-pairs with the same 
maximum frequency, one of them is ran-
domly selected as the key word-pair. 
Step 4. Arrange all word-pairs of the final WP 
set into a WP-sentence. If no word-pairs 
can be identified in the input syllables, a 
NULL WP-sentence is produced.

Table 1 is a step by step example to show 
the details of applying our WP identifier on the 
Chinese syllables ?yi1 ge5 wen2 ming2 de5 
shuai1 wei2 guo4 cheng2( ? ? [a] ? ?
[civilization]?[of]??[decay]??[process]).?  
For this case, we have a WP-sentence ????
?  de5shuai1wei2 ?? .? As we have men-
tioned in Section 1, we found this WP-sentence 
can also be used to correct the MSIME con-
verted errors in its output ???[a]??[famous]
?[of]??[decay]??[process].?

3 The STW Experiments 
To evaluate the STW performance of our WP 
identifier, we define the STW accuracy, identi-
fied character ratio (ICR) and STW improve-
ment, by the following equations: 
STW accuracy = # of correct characters / # of 
total characters.             (1) 
Identified character ratio (ICR) = # of characters 
of identified WP / # of total characters in testing 
sentences.                                (2) 
STW improvement (i.e. STW error reduction 
rate) = (accuracy of STW system with WP ? 
accuracy of STW system)) / (1 ? accuracy of 
STW system).                                    (3) 
3.1 Generation of the Word-Pair Database 
To conduct the STW experiments, firstly, use 
the inverse translator of phoneme-to-character 
(PTC) provided in GOING system to convert 
testing sentences into their corresponding sylla-
bles. Then, all the error PTC translations of 
GOING were corrected by post human-editing. 
Then, apply our WP identifier to convert these 
testing syllables back to their WP-sentences. 
Finally, calculate its STW accuracy and identi-
fied character ratio by Equations (1) and (2). 
Note that all test sentences are composed of a 
string of Chinese characters in this study. 
The training/testing corpus, closed/open test 
sets and the testing WP database used in the 
STW experiments are described as below: 
(1) Training corpus: We used the UDN2001 
corpus mentioned in Section 1 as our training 
corpus. All knowledge of word frequencies, 
word-pairs, word-pair frequencies was auto-
generated and computed by this corpus. 
(2) Testing corpus: The UDN2002 corpus was 
selected as our testing corpus. It is a collec-
tion of 3,321,504 Chinese sentences that were 
extracted from whole 2002 articles on the 
United Daily News Website (UDN).  
(3) Closed test set: 10,000 sentences were ran-
domly selected from the UDN2001 corpus as 
the closed test set. The {minimum, maximum, 
and mean} of characters per sentence for the 
closed test set were {4, 37, and 12}. 
(4) Open test set: 10,000 sentences were ran-
domly selected from the UDN2002 corpus as 
the open test set. At this point, we checked 
that the selected open test sentences were not 
in the closed test set as well. The {minimum, 
maximum, and mean} of characters per sen-
tence for the open test set were {4, 43, and 
13.7}. 
(5) Testing WP database: By applying our 
AUTO-WP on the UDN2001 corpus, we cre-
ated 25,439,679 word-pairs as the testing WP 
database. 
We conducted the STW experiment in a pro-
gressive manner. The results and analysis of the 
experiment are described in Sub-sections 3.2 
and 3.3.

3.2 STW Experiment of the WP Identifier 
The purpose of this experiment is to demon-
strate the tonal and toneless STW accuracies 
among the identified word-pairs by using the 
WP identifier with the testing WP database. 
From Table 2, the average tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of the WP identifier for the 
closed and open test sets are 98.5% and 90.7%, 
respectively. Between the closed and the open 
test sets, the differences of the tonal and tone-
less STW accuracies of the WP identifier are 
0.5% and 1.4%, respectively. These results 
strongly support that the WP identifier can be 
used to effectively perform Chinese STW con-
version on the WP-related portion.

experiment for the WP identifier on the identified 
word-pairs

Tonal  98.7% 98.2% 98.5%   (47%) 
Toneless  91.4% 90.0% 90.7%   (39%) 
3.3 A Commercial IME System and A Bi-
gram Model with WP Identifier 
We selected Microsoft Input Method Editor 
2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) as our 
experimental commercial Chinese input system. 
In addition, an optimized bigram model called 
BiGram was developed. The BiGram STW sys-
tem is a bigram-based model developing by 
SRILM (Stolcke 2002) with Good-Turing back-
off smoothing (Manning and Schuetze, 1999), 
as well as forward and backward longest sylla-
ble-word first strategies (Chen et al 1986, Tsai 
et al 2004). The training corpus and system 
dictionary of the BiGram system are same with 
that of the WP identifier. All the bigram prob-
abilities were calculated by the UDN2001 cor-
pus. 
Table 3a compares the results of MSIME 
and MSIME with the WP identifier on the 
closed and open test sentences. Table 3b com-
pares the results of BiGram and BiGram with 
the WP identifier on the closed and open test 
sentences. In this experiment, the STW output 
of the MSIME with the WP identifier, or the 
BiGram with the WP identifier, was collected 
by directly replacing the identified word-pairs 
(WP-sentences) from the corresponding STW 
output of MSIME or BiGram.

experiment for the MSIME and the MSIME with the 
WP identifier

experiment for the BiGram and the BiGram with the

Toneless    86.2% 88.8%  18.8%  
a STW accuracies of the words identified by the BiGram 
with the WP identifier
From Table 3a, the tonal and toneless STW 
improvements of MSIME by using the WP 
identifier are 27.5% and 22.1%, respectively. 
Meanwhile, from Table 3b, the tonal and tone-
less STW improvements of BiGram by using 
the WP identifier are 18.9% and 18.8%, respec-
tively. (Note that we also developed a TriGram 
STW system with the same source and tech-
niques of BiGram. However, the differences 
between the tonal and toneless STW accuracies 
of BiGram and TriGram are only about 0.2%) 
To sum up the results of this experiment, we 
conclude that the WP identifier can achieve a 
better STW accuracy than that of the MSIME 
and BiGram systems on the WP-related portion. 
The results of Tables 3a and 3b indicate that the 
WP identifier can effectively improve the tonal 
and toneless STW accuracies of MSIME and 
BiGram without tuning processing. Appendix A 
presents two cases of STW results that were 
obtained from the experiment. 
3.4 Error Analysis of the STW Conversion 
We examine the Top 300 cases in the tonal and 
toneless STW conversion errors, respectively, 
from the open testing results of BiGram with the 
WP identifier. As per our analysis, the problems 
of STW conversion errors can be classified into 
three major types: 
 (1) Unknown word problem: For any Chinese 
NLP system, unknown word extraction is 
one of the most difficult problems and a 
critical issue (Tsai et al 2003). When an er-
ror is caused only by the lack of words in 
the system dictionary, we call it unknown 
13
word problem.
(2) Inadequate syllable segmentation problem:
When an error is caused by syllable-word 
overlapping (or say ambiguous syllable-
word segmentation), instead of an unknown 
word problem, we call it inadequate sylla-
ble segmentation.
(3) Homophones problem: These are the re-
maining STW conversion errors. 
Table 4. The coverage of three problems caused the   
tonal and toneless STW conversion errors 
Problems                  Coverage (%)          
   Tonal  Toneless 
Unknown Word       12%   11% 
Inadequate Syllable 36%  51% 
Segmentation    
Homophone  53%  39% 
a STW accuracies of the words identified by the BiGram 
with the WP identifier
Table 4 is the coverage of the three problems. 
From Table 4, we have two observations:  
(1) The coverage of unknown word problem 
for tonal and toneless STW systems is 
similar. Since the unknown word problem 
is not specifically a STW problem, it can be 
easily taken care of through manual editing 
or semi-automatic learning during input. In 
practice, therefore, the tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies could be raised to 98% and 
91%, respectively. Although some of un-
known words have been incorporated in the 
system dictionary by a CWCA system (Tsai 
et al 2004), they could still face the prob-
lems: inadequate syllable segmentation and 
failed homophone disambiguation.
(2) The major problem caused error conver-
sions in tonal and toneless STW systems 
is different. To improve tonal STW sys-
tems, the major targets should be the cases 
of failed homophone selection (53% cover-
age). For toneless STW systems, on the 
other hand, the cases of inadequate syllable 
segmentation (51% coverage) should be the 
focus for improvement. 
To sum up the above two observations, the bot-
tlenecks of the STW conversion lie in the sec-
ond and third problems. To resolve these issues, 
we believe one simple and effective approach is 
to extend the size of WP database, because our 
experiment results show that the WP identifier 
can achieve better tonal and toneless STW accu-
racies than those of MSIME and BiGram on the 
WP-related portion. 
4 Conclusion and Future Directions 
In this paper, we have applied a WP identifier 
to support the Chinese language processing on 
the STW conversion and obtained a high STW 
accuracy on the identified word-pairs. All of the 
WP data can be generated fully automatically 
by applying the AUTO-WP on the system and 
user corpus. We are encouraged by the fact that 
WP knowledge can achieve tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%, respec-
tively, for the WP-related portion on the testing 
syllables. The WP identifier can be easily inte-
grated into existing Chinese input systems by 
identifying word-pairs in a post-processing step. 
Our experimental results show that, by applying 
the WP identifier together with MSIME (a tri-
gram-like model) and BiGram (an optimized 
bigram model), the tonal and toneless STW im-
provements of the two Chinese input systems 
are 27.5%/22.1% and 18.9%/18.8%, respec-
tively. For adaptation STW approach, we have 
tried to apply the AUTO-WP to extract the 
word-pairs from the 10,000 open testing sen-
tences into the testing WP database, the tonal 
and toneless STW accuracies of the MSIME 
with the adaptation WP identifier and the Bi-
Gram with the adaptation WP identifier will 
become 97.0%/97.2% and 91.1%/90.0%, re-
spectively. 
Currently, our approach is quite basic when 
more than one WP occurs in the same sentence. 
Although there is room for improvement, we 
believe it would not produce a noticeable effect 
as far as the STW accuracy is concerned. How-
ever, this issue will become important as we 
want to apply the WP knowledge to speech rec-
ognition. According to our computations, the 
collection of testing WP knowledge can cover 
approximately 50% and 40% of the characters 
in the UDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus, respec-
tively. 
We will continue to expand our collection of 
WP knowledge to cover more characters in the 
UDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus with Web 
corpus (search engine results) for improving our 
STW system. In other directions, we will try to 
improve our WP-based STW conversion with 
other statistical language models, such as HMM, 
14
and extend it to other areas of NLP, especially 
word segmentation and speech recognition.
