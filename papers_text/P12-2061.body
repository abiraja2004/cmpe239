Abstract
Reordering is a difficult task in translating
between widely different languages such as
Japanese and English. We employ the post-
ordering framework proposed by (Sudoh et
al., 2011b) for Japanese to English transla-
tion and improve upon the reordering method.
The existing post-ordering method reorders
a sequence of target language words in a
source language word order via SMT, while
our method reorders the sequence by: 1) pars-
ing the sequence to obtain syntax structures
similar to a source language structure, and 2)
transferring the obtained syntax structures into
the syntax structures of the target language.
1 Introduction
The word reordering problem is a challenging one
when translating between languages with widely
different word orders such as Japanese and En-
glish. Many reordering methods have been proposed
in statistical machine translation (SMT) research.
Those methods can be classified into the following
three types:
Type-1: Conducting the target word selection and
reordering jointly. These include phrase-based SMT
(Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrase-based SMT
(Chiang, 2007), and syntax-based SMT (Galley et
al., 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Liu et al., 2006;
Liu et al., 2009).
Type-2: Pre-ordering (Xia and McCord, 2004;
Collins et al., 2005; Tromble and Eisner, 2009; Ge,
2010; Isozaki et al., 2010b; DeNero and Uszkoreit,
2011; Wu et al., 2011). First, these methods re-
order the source language sentence into the target
language word order. Then, they translate the re-
ordered source word sequence using SMT methods.
Type-3: Post-ordering (Sudoh et al., 2011b; Ma-
tusov et al., 2005). First, these methods translate
the source sentence almost monotonously into a se-
quence of the target language words. Then, they
reorder the translated word sequence into the target
language word order.
This paper employs the post-ordering framework
for Japanese-English translation based on the dis-
cussions given in Section 2, and improves upon the
reordering method. Our method uses syntactic struc-
tures, which are essential for improving the target
word order in translating long sentences between
Japanese (a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) language)
and English (an SVO language).
Before explaining our method, we explain the pre-
ordering method for English to Japanese used in the
post-ordering framework.
In English-Japanese translation, Isozaki et al.
(2010b) proposed a simple pre-ordering method that
achieved the best quality in human evaluations,
which were conducted for the NTCIR-9 patent ma-
chine translation task (Sudoh et al., 2011a; Goto et
al., 2011). The method, which is called head final-
ization, simply moves syntactic heads to the end of
corresponding syntactic constituents (e.g., phrases
and clauses). This method first changes the English
word order into a word order similar to Japanese
word order using the head finalization rule. Then,
it translates (almost monotonously) the pre-ordered

English words into Japanese.
There are two key reasons why this pre-ordering
method works for estimating Japanese word order.
The first reason is that Japanese is a typical head-
final language. That is, a syntactic head word comes
after nonhead (dependent) words. Second, input En-
glish sentences are parsed by a high-quality parser,
Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008), which outputs syn-
tactic heads. Consequently, the parsed English in-
put sentences can be pre-ordered into a Japanese-
like word order using the head finalization rule.
Pre-ordering using the head finalization rule nat-
urally cannot be applied to Japanese-English trans-
lation, because English is not a head-final language.
If we want to pre-order Japanese sentences into an
English-like word order, we therefore have to build
complex rules (Sudoh et al., 2011b).
2 Post-ordering for Japanese to English
Sudoh et al. (2011b) proposed a post-ordering
method for Japanese-English translation. The trans-
lation flow for the post-ordering method is shown in
Figure 1, where ?HFE? is an abbreviation of ?Head
Final English?. An HFE sentence consists of En-
glish words in a Japanese-like structure. It can be
constructed by applying the head-finalization rule
(Isozaki et al., 2010b) to an English sentence parsed
by Enju. Therefore, if good rules are applied to this
HFE sentence, the underlying English sentence can
be recovered. This is the key observation of the post-
ordering method.
The process of post-ordering translation consists
of two steps. First, the Japanese input sentence is
translated into HFE almost monotonously. Then, the
word order of HFE is changed into an English word
order.
Training for the post-ordering method is con-
ducted by first converting the English sentences in
a Japanese-English parallel corpus into HFE sen-
tences using the head-finalization rule. Next, a
monotone phrase-based Japanese-HFE SMT model
is built using the Japanese-HFE parallel corpus

whose HFE was converted from English. Finally,
an HFE-to-English word reordering model is built
using the HFE-English parallel corpus.
3 Post-ordering Models
3.1 SMT Model
Sudoh et al. (2011b) have proposed using phrase-
based SMT for converting HFE sentences into En-
glish sentences. The advantage of their method is
that they can use off-the-shelf SMT techniques for
post-ordering.
3.2 Parsing Model
Our proposed model is called the parsing model.
The translation process for the parsing model is
shown in Figure 2. In this method, we first parse the
HFE sentence into a binary tree. We then swap the
nodes annotated with ? SW? suffixes in this binary
tree in order to produce an English sentence.
The structures of the HFE sentences, which are
used for training our parsing model, can be obtained
from the corresponding English sentences as fol-
lows.1 First, each English sentence in the training
Japanese-English parallel corpus is parsed into a bi-
nary tree by applying Enju. Then, for each node in
this English binary tree, the two children of each
node are swapped if its first child is the head node
(See (Isozaki et al., 2010b) for details of the head

other details of the HFE is given in Section 4.2.
312
final rules). At the same time, these swapped nodes
are annotated with ? SW?. When the two nodes are
not swapped, they are annotated with ? ST? (indi-
cating ?Straight?). A node with only one child is
not annotated with either ? ST? or ? SW?. The re-
sult is an HFE sentence in a binary tree annotated
with ? SW? and ? ST? suffixes.
Observe that the HFE sentences can be regarded
as binary trees annotated with syntax tags aug-
mented with swap/straight suffixes. Therefore, the
structures of these binary trees can be learnable by
using an off-the-shelf grammar learning algorithm.
The learned parsing model can be regarded as an
ITG model (Wu, 1997) between the HFE and En-
glish sentences. 2
In this paper, we used the Berkeley Parser (Petrov
and Klein, 2007) for learning these structures. The
HFE sentences can be parsed by using the learned
parsing model. Then the parsed structures can be
converted into their corresponding English struc-
tures by swapping the ? SW? nodes. Note that this
parsing model jointly learns how to parse and swap
the HFE sentences.
4 Detailed Explanation of Our Method
This section explains the proposed method, which
is based on the post-ordering framework using the
parsing model.
4.1 Translation Method
First, we produce N-best HFE sentences us-
ing Japanese-to-HFE monotone phrase-based SMT.
Next, we produce K-best parse trees for each HFE
sentence by parsing, and produce English sentences
by swapping any nodes annotated with ? SW?. Then
we score the English sentences and select the En-
glish sentence with the highest score.
For the score of an English sentence, we use
the sum of the log-linear SMT model score for
Japanese-to-HFE and the logarithm of the language
model probability of the English sentence.
2There are works using the ITG model in SMT: ITG was
used for training pre-ordering models (DeNero and Uszkoreit,
2011); hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2007), which is
an extension of ITG; and reordering models using ITG (Chen et
al., 2009; He et al., 2010). These methods are not post-ordering
methods.
4.2 HFE and Articles
This section describes the details of HFE sentences.
In HFE sentences: 1) Heads are final except for
coordination. 2) Pseudo-particles are inserted after
verb arguments: va0 (subject of sentence head),
va1 (subject of verb), and va2 (object of verb).
3) Articles (a, an, the) are dropped.
In our method of HFE construction, unlike that
used by (Sudoh et al., 2011b), plural nouns are left
as-is instead of converted to the singular.
Applying our parsing model to an HFE sentence
produces an English sentence that does not have
articles, but does have pseudo-particles. We re-
moved the pseudo-particles from the reordered sen-
tences before calculating the probabilities used for
the scores of the reordered sentences. A reordered
sentence without pseudo-particles is represented by
E. A language model P (E) was trained from En-
glish sentences whose articles were dropped.
In order to output a genuine English sentence E?
fromE, articles must be inserted intoE. A language
model trained using genuine English sentences is
used for this purpose. We try to insert one of the
articles {a, an, the} or no article for each word in E.
Then we calculate the maximum probability word
sequence through dynamic programming for obtain-
ing E?.
5 Experiment
5.1 Setup
We used patent sentence data for the Japanese to
English translation subtask from the NTCIR-9 and
8 (Goto et al., 2011; Fujii et al., 2010). There
were 2,000 test sentences for NTCIR-9 and 1,251
for NTCIR-8. XML entities included in the data
were decoded to UTF-8 characters before use.
We used Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) v2.4.2 for
parsing the English side of the training data. Mecab
3 v0.98 was used for the Japanese morphological
analysis. The translation model was trained using
sentences of 64 words or less from the training cor-
pus as (Sudoh et al., 2011b). We used 5-gram lan-
guage models using SRILM (Stolcke et al., 2011).
We used the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein,
2007) to train the parsing model for HFE and to

parse HFE. The parsing model was trained using 0.5
million sentences randomly selected from training
sentences of 40 words or less. We used the phrase-
based SMT system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to
calculate the SMT score and to produce HFE sen-
tences. The distortion limit was set to 0. We used
10-best Moses outputs and 10-best parsing results
of Berkeley parser.
5.2 Compared Methods
We used the following 5 comparison methods:
Phrase-based SMT (PBMT), Hierarchical phrase-
based SMT (HPBMT), String-to-tree syntax-based
SMT (SBMT), Post-ordering based on phrase-based
SMT (PO-PBMT) (Sudoh et al., 2011b), and Post-
ordering based on hierarchical phrase-based SMT
(PO-HPBMT).
We used Moses for these 5 systems. For
PO-PBMT, a distortion limit 0 was used for the
Japanese-to-HFE translation and a distortion limit
20 was used for the HFE-to-English translation.
The PO-HPBMT method changes the post-ordering
method of PO-PBMT from a phrase-based SMT
to a hierarchical phrase-based SMT. We used a
max-chart-span 15 for the hierarchical phrase-based
SMT. We used distortion limits of 12 or 20 for
PBMT and a max-chart-span 15 for HPBMT.
The parameters for SMT were tuned by MERT
using the first half of the development data with HFE
converted from English.
5.3 Results and Discussion
We evaluated translation quality based on the case-
insensitive automatic evaluation scores of RIBES
v1.1 (Isozaki et al., 2010a) and BLEU-4. The results
are shown in Table 1.

PO-HPBMT 70.47 27.49 71.34 28.78
Table 1: Evaluation results (case insensitive).
From the results, the proposed method achieved
the best scores for both RIBES and BLEU for
NTCIR-9 and NTCIR-8 test data. Since RIBES is
sensitive to global word order and BLEU is sensitive
to local word order, the effectiveness of the proposed
method for both global and local reordering can be
demonstrated through these comparisons.
In order to investigate the effects of our post-
ordering method in detail, we conducted an ?HFE-
to-English reordering? experiment, which shows the
main contribution of our post-ordering method in
the framework of post-ordering SMT as compared
with (Sudoh et al., 2011b). In this experiment, we
changed the word order of the oracle-HFE sentences
made from reference sentences into English, this is
the same way as Table 4 in (Sudoh et al., 2011b).
The results are shown in Table 2.
This results show that our post-ordering method
is more effective than PO-PBMT and PO-HPBMT.
Since RIBES is based on the rank order correla-
tion coefficient, these results show that the proposed
method correctly recovered the word order of the
English sentences. These high scores also indicate
that the parsing results for high quality HFE are
fairly trustworthy.

In these experiments, we did not compare our
method to pre-ordering methods. However, some
groups used pre-ordering methods in the NTCIR-9
Japanese to English translation subtask. The NTT-
UT (Sudoh et al., 2011a) and NAIST (Kondo et al.,
2011) groups used pre-ordering methods, but could
not produce RIBES and BLEU scores that both were
better than those of the baseline results. In contrast,
our method was able to do so.
6 Conclusion
This paper has described a new post-ordering
method. The proposed method parses sentences that
consist of target language words in a source lan-
guage word order, and does reordering by transfer-
ring the syntactic structures similar to the source lan-
guage syntactic structures into the target language
syntactic structures.
