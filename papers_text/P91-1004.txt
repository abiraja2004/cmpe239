Toward a Plan-Based Understanding Model for Mixed-Initiative Dialogues 
This paper presents an enhanced model of 
plan-based ialogue understanding. Most 
plan-based ialogue understanding models 
derived from \[Litman and Allen, 1987\] as- 
sume that the dialogue speakers have access 
to the same domain plan library, and that the 
active domain plans are shared by the two 
speakers. We call these features hared o- 
main plan constraints. These assumptions, 
however, are too strict o account for mixed- 
initiative dialogues where each speaker has a 
different set of domain plans that are housed 
in his or her own plan library, and where 
an individual speaker's domain plans may 
be activated at any point in the dialogue. 
We propose an extension to the Litman and 
Allen model by relaxing the shared omain 
plan constraints. Our extension improves (1) 
the ability to track the currently active plan, 
(2) the ability to explain the planning be- 
hind speaker utterances, and (3) the ability 
to track which speaker controls the conver- 
sational initiative in the dialogue. 
1. Introduction 
In this paper, we present an enhanced plan-based model 
of dialogue understanding that provides a framework 
for computer processing of mixed-initiative dialogues. 
In mixed-initiative dialogues, each speaker brings to 
the conversation his or her own plans and goals based 
on his or her own domain knowledge, and which do 
not necessarily match those of the other speaker, even 
in cooperative situations. Thus, mixed-initiative dia- 
logues exhibit a more complicated discourse structure 
than do dialogues in which a single speaker controls 
the conversational initiative.

ABSTRACT The existing plan-based model of dialogue under- 
standing (as represented by \[Litman and Allen, 1987\]) 
accounts for dialogues in which a single speaker con- 
trois the initiative. We call these dialogues Single- 
Initiative Dialogues. In modeling single-initiative di- 
alogues, Litman and Allen assume a shared stack that 
represents ajointplan (joint domain plan). This joint 
plan is shared by the two speakers. We claim that 
this assumption is too restrictive to apply to mixed- 
initiative dialogues, because in mixed-initiative dia- 
logues each speaker may have his or her own indi- 
vidual domain plans I. The assumption creates everal 
functional problems in the Litman and Allen model, 
namely, its inability to process mixed-initiative dia- 
logues and the need for a large amount of schema def- 
inition (domain knowledge representation) to handle 
complex conversational interactions. 
The model we present builds on the framework of 
\[Litman and Allen, 1987\]. We hypothesize, how- 
ever, that speaker-specific plan libraries are needed, 
instead of a single plan library storing joint plans, for 
a plan-based theory of discourse to account for mixed- 
initiativedialogues. In our framework, the understand- 
ing system activates the instantiated schemata (places 
them on the stack) from each speaker's individual plan 
library 2, thus creating two domain plan stacks. We 
also theorize that in addition to using the domain plans 
that are stored in a speaker's memory (plan library), 
speakers incrementally expand their domain plans in 
response to the current context of the dialogue. These 
extensions enable our model to."

2. Limitations of the Current Plan-Based 
Dialogue Understanding Model 
The current plan-based model of dialogue understand- 
ing \[Litman and Allen, 1987\] assumes a single plan 
library that contains the domain plans of the two speak- 
ers, and a shared plan stack mechanism to track the 
current plan structure of the dialogue. The shared 
stack contains the domain plans and the discourse plans 
from the plan library that are activated by the inference 
module of the dialogue understanding system. The do- 
main plan is a joint plan shared by the two dialogue 
speakers. Although this shared stack mechanism ac- 
counts for highly task-oriented and cooperative dia- 
logues where one can assume that both speakers share 
3Dialogue 1is extracted from a corpus of Japanese ATR 
(Advanced Telecommunication Research) recorded simu- 
lated conference r gistration telephone conversations. No 
visual information was exchanged between the telephone 
speakers. Dialogue 2 is extracted from a corpus of recorded 
Spanish dialogues in the travel agency domain, collected by 
the second author of this paper. These dialogues are simu- 
lated telephone conversations, where no visual information 
was exchanged. 
the same domain plan, the model does not account for 
mixed-initiative dialogues. 
In this section we examine three limitations of the 
current plan-based ialogue understanding model: 1) 
the inability to track the currently active plan, 2) the 
inability to explain a speaker's planning behind his or 
her utterances, and 3) the inability to track conversa- 
tional initiative control transfer. A dialogue under- 
standing system must be able to infer the dialogue par- 
ticipants' goals in order to arrive at an understanding 
of the speakers' actions. The inability to explain the 
planning behind speaker utterances i  a serious flaw in 
the design of a plan-based dialogue processing model. 
Tracking the conversational control initiative provides 
the system with a mechanism to identify which of a 
speaker's plans is currently activated, and which goal 
is presently being persued. We believe that an under- 
standing model for mixed-initiative dialogues must be 
able to account for these phenomena. 
2.1. Tracking the Currently Active Plan 
The Litman and Allen model lacks a mechanism to 
track which plan is the currently active plan in mixed- 
initiative dialogue where the two speakers have very 
different domain plan schemata in their individual plan 
libraries. The currently active plan is the plan or action 
that he dialogue processing system is currently consid- 
ering. In Dialogue I, after utterance (2), What am I sup- 
posed to do?, by SpA, the stack should look like Figure 
14. Although the manner in which the conference r g- 
istration domain plans may be expanded on the stack 
depends upon which domain plan schemata re avail- 
able in a speaker's domain plan library, we assume that 
a rational agent would have a schema containing the 
plan to attend aconference, A t tend-Conference .  
This plan is considered the currently active plan and 
thus marked \[Next\]. When processing the subsequent 
utterance, (3), First, you must register for the confer- 
ence., the currently active plan should be understood 
as registration, RegS.zt:er,  since SpB clearly states 
that the action 5 of registration is necessary to carry 
out the plan to attend the conference. The Litman 
and Allen model lacks a mechanism for instantiating 
a new plan within the domain unless the currently ac- 
4Notational conventions inthis paper follow \[Litman and 
Allen, 1987\]. In their model, the currently active plan is 
labeled \[Next\]. ID-PARAH in P lan2 refers to IDENTIFY- 
PARAMETER. I1 in Plan2 and AC in Plan3 are ab- 
breviated tags for INFORMREF (Inform with Reference to) 
andAttend-Conference,  respectively. Proc in Plan2 
stands for procedure. 
SThe words plan and action can be used interchangably. 
A sequence of actions as specified in the decomposition fa 
plan carry out a plan. Each action can also be a plan which 
has its own decomposition. Actions are not decomposed 
when they are primitive operators \[Litman and Alien, 1987\].

tive plan (or an action of the domain plan) marked by 
\[Next\], is executed. Thus, in this example, only if 
the plan At tend-Conference  marked as \[Next\], 
is executed, can the system process the prerequisite 
plan, Reg is ter .  Looking at this constraint from the 
point of view of an event timeline, the Litman and 
Allen model can process only temporally sequential 
actions, i.e., the At tend-Conference  event must 
be completed before the Reg is ter  event can begin. 
This problem can be clearly illustrated when we look 
at the state of the stack after utterance (4), Do you have 
a registration form?, shown in Figure 2. Utterance 
(4) stems from the action GetForm (GF) which is a 
plan for the conference office secretary to send a reg- 
istration form to the participant. It is an action of the 
Register plan. Since the Attend-Conference 
plan has not been executed, the system has two ac- 
tive plans, Attend-Conference and GetForm, 
both marked \[Next\], in the stack where only GetForm 
should be labeled the active plan. 
2.2. Explaining Speaker Planning Behind 
Utterances 
A second limitation of the Litman and Allen model 
is that it cannot explain the planning behind speaker 
utterances in certain situations. The system cannot 
process utterances stemming from speaker-specific do- 
main plans that are enacted because they are an active 
response to the previous peaker's utterance. This is 
because the model assumes ajointplan to account for 
utterances spoken in the dialogue. But utterances that 
stem from an active response stem from neither shared 
domain plans currently on the stack nor from a plan

Figure 2: State of the Stack after Utterance (4) in 
Dialogue I 
which concurrently exists in the plan libraries of the 
two speakers. 
In Figure 1, the At tend-Conference  domain 
plan from Dialogue I is expanded with the Reg is  t e r 
plan after the first utterance because utterance (4), Do 
you have a registration form?, and the subsequent con- 
versation cannot be understood without having domain 
plans entailing the Reg i  s t e r plan in the stack. If this 
were a joint domain plan, SpA's utterance What am I 
supposed to do?, could not be explained. It can be 
inferred that SpA does not have a domain plan for at- 
tending aconference, orat least hat the system did not 
activate it in the stack. The fact that SpA asks SpB 
What am I supposed to do? gives evidence that SpA 
and SpB do not share the Reg is ter  domain plan at 
that point in the dialogue. 
Another example of speaker planning that the Lit- 
man and Allen model cannot explain, occurs in Dia- 
logue II. After a series of interactions between SpA 
and SpB, SpB says in utterance (3), Couldn't we leave 
in the morning ... instead of at night?, as an active 
response to SpA. In order to explain the speaker plan- 
ning behind these utterances, the current model would 
include the schemata shown in Figure 36 . Utterance 
(3), however, does not stem from speaker action. One 
way to correct his situation within the current model 
would be to allow for the ad hoc addition of the schema, 
6This is a simplified list of schemata, excluding prereq- 
uisite conditions and effects. Like the Litman and Allen 
model, our schema definition follows that of NOAH \[Sacer- 
doti, 1977\] and STRIPS \[Fikes and Nilsson, 1971\]. 
27 
State-Preference. The consequence, however, 
of this approach is that oo large a number of schemata 
are required, and stored in the plan library, This large 
number of schemata will explode xponentially as the 
size of the domain increases. 
2.3. Tracking Conversational Initiative Control 
A third problem in the Litman and Allen model is that it 
cannot track which speaker controls the conversational 
initiative at a specific point in the dialogue, nor how 
initiatives are nested within a dialogue segment, e.g., 
within a clarification subdialogue. This is self-evident 
since the model accounts only for single-initiative di- 
alogues. Since the model calls for a joint plan, it does 
not track which of the two speakers maintains or initi- 
ates the transfer of the conversational initiative within 
the dialogue. Thus, that he conversational initiative is
transferred from SpA to SpB at utterance (3) in Dia- 
logue II, Couldn't we leave in the morning ... instead 
of at night?, or that SpA maintains the initiative during 
SpB's request for clarification about he weather, utter- 
ance (6), Really?, cannot be explained by the Litman 
and Allen model. 
3. An Enhanced Model  
In order to overcome these limitations, we propose an 
enhanced plan-based model of dialogue understand- 
ing, building on the framework described in \[Litman 
and Allen, 1987\]. Our model inherits the basic flow 
of processing in \[Litman and Allen, 1987\], such as 
a constraint-based search to activate the domain plan 
schemata in the plan library, and the stack operation. 
However, we incorporate wo modifications that enable 
our model to account for mixed-initiative dialogues, 
which the current model cannot. These modifications 
include: 
? Speaker-Specific Domain Plan Libraries and the 
Individual Placement of Speaker-Specific Plans 
on the Stack. 
? Incremental Domain Plan Expansion. 
First, our model assumes a domain plan library 
for each speaker and the individual placement of the 
speaker-specific domain plans on the stack. Figure 4 
shows how the stack is organized in our model. The 
domain plan, previously considered a joint plan, is 
separated into two domain plans, each representing a 
domain plan of a specific speaker. Each speaker can 
only be represented on the stack by his or her own 
domain plans. Progression from one domain plan to 
another can only be accomplished through the system's 
recognition of speaker utterances in the dialogue. 
Discourse Plan 
Domain Plans Domain Plans 
Speaker A Speaker B 
Figure 4: New Stack Structure 
Second, our model includes an incremental expan- 
sion of domain plans. Dialogue speakers use domain 
plans stored in their individual plan library in response 
to the content of the previous peaker's utterance. The 
domain plans can be further expanded when they ac- 
Ovate additional domain plans in the plan library of 
the current speaker. For example, if a domain plan 
is marked \[Next\] (currently active), the system de- 
composes the plan into its component plan sequence. 
Then the first element in the component plan sequence 
(which is an action) is marked \[Next\] and the previous 
plan is no longer marked. Figure 5 illustrates how 
the domain plans in Dialogue I can be incrementally 
expanded. In Figure 5(a), A t tend-Conference  
is the only plan activated, and it is marked \[Next\]. 
As the plan is expanded, \[Next\] is moved to the first 
action of the decomposition sequence (Figure 5(b)). 
This expansion is attributed to information provided 
by the previous peaker, for example, First, you must 
register for the conference. (If such an utterance is 
not made, no expansion takes place.) Then, if the 
subsequent speaker has a plan for the registration pro- 
cedure, the domain plan for Reg is ter  is expanded 
under Reg is ter .  Again, \[Next\] ismoved to the first 
element of the component plan sequence, GetForm 
(Figure 5(c)). 
We are implementing this model using the Span- 
ish travel agency domain corpus and the Japanese 
ATR conference r gistration corpus. The implemen- 
tation is in CMU CommonLisp, and uses the CMU 
FrameKit frame-based knowledge r presentation sys- 
tem. The module accepts output from the Generalized 
LR Parsers developed at Carnegie Mellon University 
\[Tomita, 1985\]. 
4. Examples  
4.1. Tracking the Currently Active Plan 
In our model, we provide a mechanism for consis- 
tently tracking the individual speaker's currently ac- 
tive plans. First, we show how the model keeps track 
of a speaker's plans within mixed-initiative dialogue. 
The state of the stack after utterance (2), What am I 
supposed to do?, in Dialogue I, should look like Fig- 
ure 6. P lan  3 represents a domain plan of SpA,

Figure 5: Incremental Domain Plan Expansion for Dialogue I 
and P lan  4 represents a domain plan of SpB. Since 
SpA does not know what he or she is supposed to do 
to attend the conference, the only plan in the stack 
is A t tend-Conference .  SpB knOWS the regis- 
tration procedure details, so his or her domain plan 
is expanded to include Reg is ter ,  and then its de- 
composition into the GetForm F i l l  Send action 
sequence. The first element of the decomposition is 
further expanded, and an action sequence notHave 
GetAdrs Send is created under GetForn~ The 
action sequence notHave GetAdrs Send is a se- 
quence where the secretary's plan is to ask whether 
SpA already has a registration form (notHave), and 
if not, to ask his or her name and address (GetAdrs), 
and to send him or her a form (Send). 
Figure 7 shows the state of the stack in Dialogue 
I after SpB's question, utterance (4), Do you have a 
registration form?. From the information given in his 
or her previous utterance, (3), First, you must register 
for the conference., SpA's domain plan (Plan3) was 
expanded downward. Thus, P lan3 has a Reg is ter  
plan, and it is marked \[Next\]. For SpB, notHave 
is marked \[Next\], indicating that it is his or her plan 
currently under consideration. Although SpB's cur- 
rently active plan is notHave, SpA considers the 
Regis ter  plan to be the current plan because SpA 
does not have the schema that includes the decompo- 
sition of the Reg is ter  plan. 
4.2. Explaining Speaker Planning Behind 
Utterances 
Second, our model explains a speaker's active plan- 
ning behind an utterance. In the Litman and Allen 
model, SpA's utterance (2) in Dialogue I, What am I 
supposed to do ?, cannot be explained if the domain plan 
At tend-Conference  is shared by the two speak- 
ers. In such a jointplan both speakers would know that 
a conference participant needs to register for a confer- 
ence. However, the rational agent will not ask What 
am I supposed to do? if he or she already knows the 
details of the registration procedure. But, if such an 
expansion isnot made on the stack, the system cannot 
process SpB's reply, First, you must register for the 
conference., because there would be no domain plan 
on the stack for Register. This dilemma cannot be 
solved with ajointplan. It, however, can be resolved by 
assuming individual domain plan libraries and an active 
domain plan for each speaker. As shown in Figure 6, 
when SpA asks What am I supposed to do?, the active 
domain plan is solely At tend-Conference ,  with 
no decomposition. SpB's domain plan, on the other 
hand, contains the full details of the conference r gis- 
tration procedure. This enables SpB to say First, you 
must register for the conference. Italso enables SpB to 
ask Do you have a registration form?, because the ac- 
tion to ask whether SpA has a form or not (notHave) 
is already on the stack due to action decomposition. 
Our model also explains speaker planning in Dia- 
logue II. In this dialogue, the traveler (SpB)'s utterance 
(3), Couldn't we leave in the morning ... instead of at

night?, can be explained by the plan specific tO SpB 
which is to State -Depar t -P re ference .  In our 
model, we assign plans to a specific speaker, depend- 
ing upon his or her role in the dialogue, e.g., traveler 
or travel agent. This eliminates the potential combina- 
torial explosion of the number of schemata required in 
the current model. 
4.3. Tracking Conversational Initiative Control 
Third, our model provides a consistent mechanism to 
track who controls the conversational initiative at any 
given utterance in the dialogue. This mechanism pro- 
vides an explanation for the initiative control rules pro- 
posed by \[Walker and Whittaker, 1990\], within the 
plan-based model of dialogue understanding. Our data 
allow us to state the following rule: 
? When Sp-X makes an utterance that instantiates 
a discourse plan based on his or her domain plan, 
then Sp-X controls the conversational initiative. 
This rule also holds in the nesting of initiatives, uch 
as in a clarification dialogue segment: 
? When Sp-X makes an utterance that instantiates a 
discourse plan based on his or her domain plans 
and Sp-Y replies with an utterance that instantiates 
a discourse plan, then Sp-X maintains control of 
the conversational initiative. 
In Dialogue II, illustrated in Figure 8, SpB's 
question, utterance (3), Couldn't we leave in the 
morning ... instead of at night?, instantiates dis- 
course P lan  5. It stems from SpB's domain plan 
State -Depar t -Pre ference .  In this case, the 
first conversational initiative tracking rule applies, and 
the initiative is transferred toSpB. 
In contrast, SpB's response of Really? to SpA's 
utterance (5), You would be traveling during the day 
which would be difficult because it's very hot., is a re- 
quest for clarification. This time, the second rule cited 
above for nested initiatives applies, and the initiative 
remains with SpA. 
5. Related Works 
allows other embedded turn-takings. 2) Communica- 
tion plans - plans that determine how to execute or 
achieve an utterance goal or dialogue goals. 3) Di- 
alogue plans - plans for establishing a dialogue con- 
struction. 4) Domain plans. The ATR model attempts 
to capture complex conversational interaction by using 
a hierarchy of plans whereas our model tries to capture 
the same phenomena by speaker-specific domain plans 
and discourse plans. Their interaction, communica- 
tion, and dialogue plans operate at a level above our 
speaker-specific domain plans. Their plans serve as a 
type of meta-planning to their and our domain plans. 
An extension enabling their plan hierarchy to operate 
orthogonally toour model would be possible. 
Our model is consistent with the initiative control 
rules presented in \[Walker and Whittaker, 1990\]. In 
their control rules scheme, however, the speaker con- 
trois the initiative when the dialogue utterance type 
(surface structure analysis) is an assertion (unless the 
utterance is a response to a question), a command, 
or a question (unless the utterance is a response to a 
question or command). In our model, the conversa- 
tional initiative control is explained by the speaker's 
planning. In our model, control is transferred from 
the INITIATING CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (ICP) 
tO the OTHER CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (OCP) 
when the utterance by the OCP is made based on the 
OCP's domain plan, not as a reply tO the utterance made 
by the ICP based on the ICP's domain plan. Cases 
where no initiative control transfer takes place despite 
the utterance type (assertion, command or question) 
substantiate hat these utterances are (1) an assertion 
which is a response by the ICP through rD-PARAM 
tO answer a question, and (2) a question to clarify the 
command or question uttered by the ICP, and which 
includes a question functioning as a clarification dis- 
course plan. Our model provides an explanation for the 
initiative control rules proposed by \[Walker and Whit- 
taker, 1990\] within the framework of the plan-based 
model of dialogue understanding. \[Walker and Whit- 
taker, 1990\] only provide a descriptive explanation of 
this phenomenon. 
Carberry \[Carberry, 1990\] discusses plan disparity in 
which the plan inferred by the user modeling program 
differs from the actual plan of the user. However, 
her work does not address mixed-initiative dialogue 
understanding where either of the speakers can control 
the conversational initaitive. 
The ATR dialogue understanding system \[Yarnaoka 
and Iida, 1990\] incorporates a plan hierarchy com- 
prising three kinds of universal pragmatic and domain 
plans to process cooperative and goal-oriented dia- 
logues. They simulated the processing of such dia- 
logues using the following plans: 1) Interaction plans 
- plans characterized by dialogue turn-taking that de- 
scribes asequence of communicative acts. Turn-taking 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper we present an enhanced model of plan- 
based dialogue understanding. Our analysis demon-

count for active planning behind speaker utterances and 
track the transfer of conversational initiative control in 
dialogues, all of which characterize mixed-initiative 
dialogues. Our model employs peaker-specific do- 
main plan libraries and the incremental expansion of 
domain plans to account for these mixed-initiative di-
alogue phenomena. We have used representative dia- 
logues in two languages todemonstrate how our model 
accounts for these phenomena.
