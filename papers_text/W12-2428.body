Abstract 
A preliminary work on symptom name recog-
nition from free-text clinical records (FCRs) 
of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is de-
picted in this paper. This problem is viewed as 
labeling each character in FCRs of TCM with 
a pre-defined tag (?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC? or ?O-
SYC?) to indicate the character?s role (a be-
ginning, inside or outside part of a symptom 
name). The task is handled by Conditional 
Random Fields (CRFs) based on two types of 
features. The symptom name recognition F-
Measure can reach up to 62.829% with recog-
nition rate 93.403% and recognition error rate 
52.665% under our experiment settings. The 
feasibility and effectiveness of the methods 
and reasonable features are verified, and sev-
eral interesting and helpful results are shown. 
A detailed analysis for recognizing symptom 
names from FCRs of TCM is presented 
through analyzing labeling results of CRFs. 
1 Introduction* 
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a comple-
mentary medical theory to western medicine, pro-
vides a distinct way to view our human life (Pal, 
2002; Barnes, et al., 2004; Molassiotis, et al., 
2005). Moreover, it has shown that TCM 
knowledge, which is accumulated in clinical prac-
tice, has become one of the most important sources 
of modern biomedical research (Zhou, et al., 2010).

In recent years, Data Mining and Machine 
Learning have been more than ever before applied 
to TCM clinical research, such as establishing 
TCM diagnosis expert systems for supporting deci-
sion making (Wang, et al., 2004; Huang and Chen, 
2007; Zhang, et al., 2008). However, most of the 
works are based on manually well-structured da-
tasets. 
Because of the high cost of manually structuring 
and maintaining free-text clinical records (FCRs) 
of TCM, large volume of such datasets has not 
been exploited effectively (Zhou, et al., 2010), alt-
hough they are significant for discovering new 
knowledge or capturing medical regularities. 
Therefore, developing appropriate information ex-
traction methods for handling FCRs of TCM is an 
urgent need to reduce the manual labor for re-
searchers. 
Automatically extracting meaningful infor-
mation and knowledge from FCRs of TCM is chal-
lenging in Data Mining and Machine Learning 
fields (Zhou, et al., 2010). As the basis, symptom 
name recognition or extraction from FCRs of TCM 
is in an early stage. To the best of our knowledge, 
there has little work to solve this problem (Wang, 
et al., 2010; Wang, et al., 2012). Symptom name 
recognition from FCRs of TCM was firstly at-
tempted in (Wang, et al., 2010) through normaliz-
ing the symptom names in clinical records based 
on literal similarity and remedy-based similarity 
methods but not directly recognizing original clini-
cal symptom names from FCRs of TCM. In 2012, 
Wang, et al. proposed a framework of automatic 
diagnosis of TCM for practice. Symptom name 
recognition is one part of the framework and simp-
223
ly attempted through a literal similarity method 
without detailed analysis (summarized procedures 
for the previous wok are shown in figure 1). 
 
Figure 1. Simple Conclusions of the Previous Work. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been 
widely studied. There have been lots of methods 
for Chinese NER (Zhang, et al., 2003; Wu, et al., 
2003; Gao, et al., 2005; Fu and Luke, 2005; Zhou, 
2006; Duan and Zhang, 2011). However, these 
methods cannot be directly applied on symptom 
name recognition from FCRs of TCM due to big 
differences of characteristics of the corpus (Wang, 
et al., 2012). There are also several related work on 
English NER, but Chinese NER has more chal-
lenges because of the distinct characteristics of 
Chinese (Wu, et al., 2003). 
In this paper, the task of symptom name recog-
nition from FCRs of TCM is studied. The symp-
tom names are recognized through finding their 
description boundaries from FCRs of TCM, and 
the method is described in section 2. Several rea-
sonable and helpful features are introduced for 
CRFs to label the characters in FCRs of TCM with 
pre-defined boundary tags to indicate their roles (a 
beginning, inside or outside part of a symptom 
name) (presented in section 3). At last, several in-
teresting and valuable experimental results are 
shown in section 4 and a conclusion is given in 
section 5. 
2 Symptom Name Recognition from FCRs 
of TCM 
The task of symptom name recognition from FCRs 
of TCM can be treated as detecting the boundaries 
of the symptom name descriptions in the sentences 
of FCRs of TCM. Therefore, this task can be 
viewed as labeling each tagging unit (e.g. word) in 
the sentences with a pre-defined tag indicating 
whether the unit is a beginning, inside, or outside 
part of a symptom name. 
Generally, the tagging unit is word (Ramshaw 
and Marcus, 1995). However, there is no natural 
segmentation for words in Chinese sentences. 
Therefore, Chinese word segmentation problem 
has to face up firstly (Gao, et al., 2005). Because of 
the characteristics of FCRs of TCM (Wang, et al., 
2012), automatically segmenting FCRs of TCM 
into words is not trivial and common Chinese word 
segmentation methods are not suitable. In order to 
tackle this problem, Chinese character is settled as 
the basic tagging unit. An example sentence of the 
labeling task is shown in figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. An Example Sentence of the Symptom Name 
Recognition Task. 
In figure 2, each character is labeled with a pre-
defined tag (?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC? or ?O-SYC?). The 
meaning of each tag is defined in table 1. 
Tag Meaning 
B-SYC Beginning of a TCM symptom name 
I-SYC Inside a TCM symptom name 
O-SYC Outside the TCM symptom names 
Table 1. Meanings of the Pre-defined Tags. 
Consequently, a recognized symptom name 
should start with a character labeled with ?B-SYC? 
and end before the character whose corresponding 
label changes from ?I-SYC? to ?B-SYC? or ?O-
SYC? for the first time. The labeling task can be 
formulated as follows: 
Given a FCR
1 2x ,x ,...,xn?x , where x i  is a 
Chinese character, the goal is to build a annotator 
p  to accurately label x  with the credible corre-
sponding tag sequence ( )p?y x , where 
1 2= y ,y ,..., yny  and y {B-SYC,I-SYC,O-SYC}n ? . 
This task can be effectively done by CRFs (Sha 
and Pereira, 2003) based on a training dataset 
which is consisted of pairs of sequences ( , )x y . 
224
3 Conditional Random Fields for Symp-
tom Name Recognition 
3.1 Conditional Random Fields 
A Conditional Random Field can be defined as an 
undirected graphical model (see figure 3) which 
consists of a sequence of vertices representing ran-
dom variables 
1 2( , ,..., )nY Y Y?Y  and edges repre-
senting conditional dependencies, conditioned on 
1 2( , ,..., )nX X X?X . The random variable iY  only 
has edges with its predecessor 
1iY ?  and successor 
1iY ? , thus, random variables 1 2, ,..., nY Y Y  obey the 
Markov property and form a linear Markov chain. 
 
Figure 3. An Undirected Graphical Structure for a Con-
ditional Random Field. 
Then the conditional probability of a label se-
quence given an input sequence can be defined as:

Where f  is a global feature vector (Sha and 
Pereira, 2003) and each element of f  is an arbi-
trary feature selection function 
kf  ( [1, ]k K? , 
where K  is the number of feature functions). ?  is 
a weight vector comprised by the learned weight 
k?  for each feature function. More detailed de-
scription is that,

The most likely label sequence for an input se-
quence x  is:  
argmax ( | )p?

It can be found with the Viterbi algorithm. We 
use the CRF++ tool in the experiments, which pro-
vides an efficient implementation for CRFs by us-
ing the limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm 
for training the models (Sha and Pereira, 2003; 
Lafferty, et al., 2001) and the default settings of 
CRF++ are used. 
3.2 Features for Labeling 
It is difficult to analyze the syntactic structure of 
the content in FCRs of TCM which has narrative 
form, concise style and nonstandard description 
characteristics. Therefore, no higher level syntactic 
features, such as POS tags or NP chunks, can be 
used at the moment. Through analyzing FCRs of 
TCM, two types of representative and reasonable 
features (i.e. literal features and positional features) 
are exploited. The features are introduced and their 
reasonableness is explained by examples as fol-
lows. 
Literal Features: the simplest and the most ob-
vious features for determining the boundaries of 
symptom name descriptions are literal features. For 
example, according to the observation that after a 
word which is used to specify time (e.g. ???? 
(yesterday)) there would usually follow a symptom 
name description, such as ???? (borborygmus). 
The best approach to get such features is to di-
vide the content of FCRs of TCM into words. 
However, as described before, Chinese word seg-
mentation is not trivial work. Fortunately, seg-
menting the content into n-grams is considerable 
and reasonable, because the indicating words 
would be mixed in the n-gram segments and could 
be helpful to determine the boundaries of symptom 
name descriptions. 
Furthermore, the FCRs of TCM have a concise 
style, i.e. the length of the clauses in FCRs of TCM 
is short and words are usually used in their brief 
form. Therefore, the n-grams as the literal features 
need not be too long. In general, the average length 
of a Chinese word approximates 2 (Nie, et al., 
2000). Consequently, the value of n  should set to 
range from 1 to 3. Moreover, according to the intu-
ition that ?the distance between current character 
and its related n-grams in FCRs of TCM would not 
be too far?, the context window size, which is the 
fragment scope picking up literal features (i.e. n-
225
grams (see examples in table 2)) in FCRs of TCM, 
would not be too large. Otherwise it would bring 
about noisy information, thereby reducing the la-
beling precision. The context window size in our 
experiment is specified smaller then 4.

Table 2. Literal Feature Examples Used in the Experi-
ments. Ci is the character at current position i in one 
clause. 
Positional Features: positions of characters in 
FCRs of TCM are also helpful. They are assistant 
features to determine the boundaries of symptom 
name descriptions. 
The start of a sentence would be usually a com-
mon character (i.e. its corresponding label is ?O-
SYC?) rather than the beginning of a symptom 
name description. On the contrary, the starting po-
sitions of the following clauses have higher proba-
bilities to be labeled with ?B-SYC?. Taking the 
FCR ?????, ???, ????? (Yesterday, 
the patient had borborygmus and more farting, and 
his/her heart was uncomfortable) as an example, it 
starts with a common word ???? (yesterday) 
followed by a symptom name ???? (borboryg-
mus). And at the same time, following clauses all 
start with symptom name descriptions. 
The example of positional features is shown in 
figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Example of Positional Features. 
In figure 4, one ?[SubSID-POS]? represents a 
positional feature, and SubSID is the index of cur-
rent clause in a FCR and POS indicates the posi-
tion of a character in current clause. 
4 Experiments 
In this section, the proposed method for symptom 
name recognition from TCM FCRs is evaluated, 
and the usefulness of the introduced features is 
verified based on a TCM clinical dataset. The re-
sults are depicted bellow. 
4.1 Experimental Datasets 
In this paper, a clinical record dataset (CRD) is 
used. It contains 11613 FCRs of TCM and was 
collected by TCM doctors during their routine di-
agnostic work. The Chinese characters in FCRs of 
CRD are annotated with tags ?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC?, 
and ?O-SYC?. The number of each type of tags is 
69193, 104243 and 142860, respectively. There are 
4235 unique symptom names in CRD, and the 
amount of annotated symptom names is 69193.

Datasets. 
CRD is divided into two sub-datasets (i.e. a 
training dataset (3483 FCRs, 25% of CRD) and a 
test dataset (8130 FCRs, 75% of CRD)). For con-
226
venience, all numbers (e.g. integers, decimals and 
fractions, etc.) in CRD are uniformly replaced by a 
English character ?N? in advance. Detailed infor-
mation of training and test datasets is listed in table 
3. 
4.2 Evaluation Metrics 
A new method for symptom name recognition 
from FCRs of TCM is proposed and two types of 
features are introduced. To evaluate the feasibility 
and effectiveness of the method and features, two 
groups of evaluation metrics are designed: (1) for 
assessing the ability of symptom name recognition, 
symptom name recognition rate, recognition error 
rate and recognition F-Measure are defined; (2) for 
giving a detailed analysis, the labeling precision, 
recall, and F-Measure are exercised. The detailed 
explanations of these metrics are described below. 
Symptom name recognition rate (RRdet), 
recognition error rate (RERdet) and recognition 
F-Measure (RFMdet): these metrics are designed 
for assessing capability of the proposed method for 
symptom name recognition from TCM FCRs. If 
and only if the boundary of a symptom name is 
labeled accurately (i.e. starting with ?B-SYC? and 
ending with the first change from ?I-SYC? to ?B--
SYC? or ?O-SYC?), the recognized symptom 
name is correct. Higher RRdet and lower RERdet are 
achieved; better symptom name recognition per-
formance RFMdet would be obtained. RRdet, RERdet 
and RFMdet are formulated as follows.

Where | |NSDC  is the number of symptom

in the test dataset, and | |SD  is the number of

Labeling precision (Prelab), recall (Reclab) and 
F-Measure (FMlab): the metrics (Prelab, Reclab and 
FMlab) are used to evaluate the performance of la-
beling Chinese character sequences of FCRs of 
TCM for giving a detailed analysis. They are de-
fined below.

4.3 Evaluation of Symptom Name Recogni-
tion Ability 
Comprehensive evaluations of symptom name 
recognition ability using CRFs with reasonable 
features are shown in figure 5, 6 and 7. These fig-
ures show that CRFs with reasonable features for 
symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM is 
feasible. The best RFMdet 62.829% (RRdet 93.403% 
and RERdet 52.665%) is achieved under settings 
CWS 3?  and features Uni+Big+Tri used. 
 
Figure 5. Symptom Name Recognition Rate. 
It obviously shows in figures 5, 6 and 7 that lit-
eral features and positional features are helpful to 
symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM. 
More types of features are used; better recognition 
performance would be obtained in most cases. 
When CWS 1?  and referred features changed 
from unigram literal features to the combination of 
unigram and bigram literal features, the highest 
growth about 3.925% of RFMdet is achieved (the 
227
RRdet increases from 87.586% to 93.034% and the 
RERdet decreases from 56.173% to 53.118%). 
 
Figure 6. Symptom Name Recognition Error Rate. 
 
Figure 7. Symptom Name Recognition F-Measure. 
As described previously, the context information 
is helpful to symptom name recognition. However, 
the context window size should not be too large. In 
figures 5, 6 and 7, it clearly shows that when CWS 
increase RRdet and RFMdet are improved and 
RFMdet is reduced. When CWS grows too large 
(larger than 3 here), RRdet and RFMdet begin, never-
theless, to descend and RERdet is raised in most 
every cases. 
Moreover, positional features are complemen-
tary features to literal features for symptom name 
recognition from FCRs of TCM. It vividly shows 
in figures 5, 6 and 7 that RRdet and RFMdet would 
be improved and RERdet would be reduced more or 
less when literal features combined with positional 
features. The highest elevation can reach 0.297% if 
the combination features of trigram literal features 
and positional features are used and CWS 1? . 
4.4 Evaluation of Labeling Performance and 
Detailed Analysis for Symptom Name 
Recognition 
In this part, firstly, an evaluation for labeling per-
formance is given, and then a detailed analysis for 
symptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM 
using CRFs with reasonable features would be de-
scribed. 
The results of Prelab and FMlab under different 
situations are shown in figure 8 and 9, respectively. 
The Reclab here are all 100%. It can be seen from 
these figures that the FMlab can reach nearly up to 
97.596% with corresponding Prelab 95.305%. The 
results can also demonstrate the feasibility of the 
proposed method for symptom name recognition 
from FCRs of TCM and the worth of the repre-
sentative and reasonable features introduced in this 
paper. The properties of literal features and posi-
tional features, which are just described in section 
4.3, are also reflected in figures 8 and 9. 
 
Figure 8. Results of Prelab under Different Situations. 
 
Figure 9. Results of FMlab under Different Situations. 
Although RRdet can achieve a very high perfor-
mance, however, RERdet is also too high. In figures 
8 and 9, high labeling results was gotten. It implies 
that the probable position of the symptom name 
can be found in TCM FCRs, but the exact bounda-
ries of the symptom name descriptions cannot be 
detected accurately yet. 
More careful results are listed in table 4. In this 
table, the average labeling Prelab of labels ?B-
228
SYC? and ?O-SYC? are always higher than the 
global average precision, but the average Prelab of 
?I-SYC? is lower than the global average precision. 
It implies that the performance of labeling the end 
position of a symptom name description is worse 
than the other position?s. In other words, the judg-
ment on whether ?I-SYC? or ?O-SYC? is more 
difficult. Therefore, as the future work, how to ac-
curately determine the end of a symptom name 
description should be paid more attention to.

5 Conclusion 
In this paper, a preliminary work on symptom 
name recognition from FCRs of TCM is described, 
and a feasible method based on CRFs with reason-
able features is investigated. Through the experi-
ments, the specialties, usage and effectiveness of 
the introduced features are verified. 
In future, particular syntactic structure and 
grammatical rules for FCRs of TCM need to be 
defined and studied based on the characteristics of 
FCRs of TCM. On the one hand, they can help the 
TCM doctors and researchers to understand the 
clinical records deeper (Spasic, et al., 2005; Zhou, 
et al., 2010), and on the other hand, technically, 
they are good for filtering and reducing feature size 
and providing basics and adequate evidence for 
symptom name normalization process and auto-
matic diagnosis procedure.
