Abstract
The GE NLTooLsET is a set of text interpretation tools designed to be easily adapted to ne w
domains . This report summarizes the system and its performance on the MUG-4 task .
INTRODUCTIO N
The GE NLTooLsET aims at extracting and deriving useful information from text using a knowledge-based ,
domain-independent core of text processing tools, and customizing the existing programs to each new task .
The program achieves this transportability by using a core knowledge base and lexicon that adapts easil y
to new applications, along with a flexible text processing strategy that is tolerant of gaps in the program 's
knowledge base .
The language analysis strategy in the NLTooLsET uses fairly detailed, chart-style syntactic parsin g
guided by conceptual expectations . Domain-driven conceptual structures provide feedback in parsing, con -
tribute to scoring alternative interpretations, help recovery from failed parses, and tie together information
across sentence boundaries. The interaction between linguistic and conceptual knowledge sources at the leve l
of linguistic relations, called "relation-driven control" was added to the system in a first implementation be -
fore MUC-4 .
In addition to flexible control, the design of the NLTooLsET allows each knowledge source to influenc e
different stages of processing . For example, discourse processing starts before parsing, although many deci-
sions about template merging and splitting are made after parsing . This allows context to guide language
analysis, while language analysis still determines context .
The NLTooLsET, now in Version 3 .0, has been developed and extended during the three years since th e
MUCK-II evaluation . During this time, several person-years of development have gone into the system . The
fundamental knowledge-based strategy has remained basically unchanged, but various modules have been
extended and replaced, and new components have been added while the system has served as a testbed for
a variety of experiments . The only new module added for MUC-4 was a mechanism for dealing with spatia l
and temporal information ; most of the other improvements to the system were knowledge base extensions ,
enhancements to existing components, and bug fixes .
The next section briefly describes the major portions of the NLTooLsET and its control flow ; the re-
mainder of the paper will discuss the application of the Toolset to the MUC-4 task .
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Processing in the NLTooLsET divides roughly into three stages : (1) pre-processing, consisting mainly o f
a pattern matcher and discourse processing module, (2) linguistic analysis, including parsing and semanti c
177
interpretation, and (3) post-processing, or template filling . Each stage of analysis applies a combination o f
linguistic, conceptual, and domain knowledge, as shown in Figure 1 .

The pre-processor uses lexico-semantic patterns to perform some initial segmentation of the text, iden-
tifying phrases that are template activators, filtering out irrelevant text, combining and collapsing som e
linguistic constructs, and marking portions of text that could describe discrete events . This component i s
described in [1] . Linguistic analysis combines parsing and word sense-based semantic interpretation wit h
domain-driven conceptual processing . The programs for linguistic analysis are largely those explained i n
[2, 3]?the changes made for MUC-4 involved mainly some additional mechanisms for recovering from faile d
processing and heavy pruning of spurious parses . Post-processing includes the final selection of template s
and mapping semantic categories and roles onto those templates . This component used the basic element s
from MUCK-II, adding a number of specialized rules for handling guerrilla warfare, types, and refines th e
discourse structures to perform the template splitting and merging required for MUC-3 and MUC-4 .
The control flow of the system is primarily from linguistic analysis to conceptual interpretation to domai n
interpretation, but there is substantial feedback from conceptual and domain interpretation to linguisti c
analysis . The MUC-4 version of the Toolset includes a version of a strategy called relation-driven control,
which helps to mediate between the various knowledge sources involved in interpretation . Basically, relation-
driven control gives each linguistic relation in the text (such as subject-verb, verb-complement, or verb -
adjunct) a preference score based on its interpretation in context . Because these relations can apply to a
great many different surface structures, relation-driven control provides a means of combining preference s
without the tremendous combinatorics of scoring many complete parses . Effectively, relation-driven contro l
permits a "beam" strategy for considering multiple interpretations without producing hundreds or thousand s
of new paths through the linguistic chart .
The knowledge base of the system, consisting of a feature and function (unification-style) grammar wit h
associated linguistic relations, and a core sense-based lexicon, still proves transportable and largely generic .
The core lexicon contains over 10,000 entries, of which 37 are restricted because of specialized usage in th e
MUC-4 domain (such as device, which always means a bomb, and plant, which as a verb usually means to
place a bomb and as a noun usually means the target of an attack) . The core grammar contains abou t
170 rules, with 50 relations and 80 additional subcategories . There were 23 MUC-specific additions to this
grammatical knowledge base, including 8 grammar rules, most of them dealing with unusual noun phrase s
that describe organizations in the corpus .
The control, pre-processing, and transportable knowledge base were all extremely successful for MUC-4 ;
remarkably, lexical and grammatical coverage, along with the associated problems in controlling search an d
selecting among interpretations, proved not to be the major stumbling blocks for our system . While the
program rarely produce an incorrect answer as a result of a sentence interpretation error, it frequently fail s
17 8
to distinguish multiple events, resolve vague or subtle references, and pick up subtle clues from non-ke y
sentences . These are the major areas for future improvements in MUC-like tasks .
ANALYSIS OF TST2-0048
Overview of Example
TST2-0048 is faily representative of how the NLTooLSET performed on MUC-4 . The program successfully
interpreted most of the key sentences but missed some references and failed to tie some additional informatio n
in to the main event . As a result, it filled two templates for what should have been one event and misse d
some additional fills . The program thus derived 53 slots out of a possible 52, with 34 correct, 19 missing ,
and 19 spurious for .65 recall, .64 precision, and .35 overgeneration . We made no special effort to adapt th e
system or fix problems for this particular example ; in fact, we used TST2 as a "blind" test and did not d o
any development on that set at all .
Detail of Message Run
This example is actually quite simple at the sentence level 1 : The sentences are fairly short and grammatical ,
especially when compared to some of the convoluted propaganda stories, and TRUMP had no real problems
with them . The story is difficult from a discourse perspective, because it returns to the main event (th e
attack on Alvarado) essentially without any cue after describing a background event (the attack on Merino' s
home) . In addition, the story is difficult and a bit unusual in the implicit information that is captured i n
the answer key?that the seven children, because they were home when Merino's house was attacked, ar e
targets . Most of the difference between our system's response and the correct templates was due to thes e
two story-level problems .
The program made one or two other minor mistakes ; for example, it was penalized for filling in "INDI-
VIDUAL" as a perpetrator (from the phrase AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF
THE ARMORED VEHICLE), an apparently correct fill that could have been resolved to "URBAN GUER-
RILLAS". It missed the SOME DAMAGE effect for the vehicle, which should have been inferred from th e
fact that the story later says the roof of the vehicle collapsed .
The system correctly parsed most of the main sentences, correctly linked the accusation in the firs t
sentence to the murder of the Attorney General in the same sentence, and correctly separated the secon d
event, which was distinguished by the temporal expression 5 days ago .
As explained earlier, the Toolset uses pattern matching for pre-processing, followed by discourse pro-
cessing, parsing and semantic interpretation, and finally template-filling . The pre-processor in this example
filters out most of the irrelevant sentences (and, in this case, two of the relevant ones), recognizes mos t
of the compound names (e .g . SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI and AT-
TORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO) . The pre-processor marks phrases that activate
templates (such as A BOMB PLACED and CLAIMED CREDIT), brackets out phrases like source an d
location (ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI and IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR), and tags a few word s
with part-of-speech to help the parser (e .g . auxiliaries (HAS), complementizers (THAT), and certain verb s
following "to" (COLLAPSE)) .
The last stage of pre-processing is a discourse processing module, which attempts a preliminary segmen-
tation of the input story using temporal, spatial, and other cues, event types, and looking for certain definit e
and indefinite descriptions of events . In this case, the module identifies five potential segments . The firs t
three turn out to be different descriptions of the same event (the killing of Alvarado), but they are late r
correctly merged into one template . The fourth segment is correctly identified as a new event (the attack o n
Merino's home). The fifth segment (describing the injury to Alvarado's bodyguards) is correctly treated a s
a new description, but is never identified as being part of the same event as the attack on Alvarado .
Linguistic analysis parses each sentence and produces (possibly alternative) semantic interpretations a t
the sentence level . These interpretations select word senses and roles, heavily favoring domain-specific senses .
The parser did fail in one important sentence in TST2-0048 : In the sentence "A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE O F
I See Appendix F for the text and answer templates for the example .
179
MERINO ' S WAS INJURED " , it could not parse the apostrophe-s construct . This was a harmless failur e
because it occurs between a noun phrase and a verb phrase, and one of the parser's recovery strategie s
attaches any remaining compatible fragments that will contribute to a template fill .
The interpretation of each sentence is interleaved with domain-driven analysis . The conceptual ana-
lyzer, TRUMPET, takes the results of interpreting each phrase and tries to map them onto domain-base d
expectations, determining, for example, the appropriate role for the FMLN in "ACCUSED THE FMLN" a s
well as associating "support" events (such as accusations and effects) with main events (such as attacks o r
bombings) . Because the discourse pre-processing module is prone to error, TRUMPET has begun to play a
major role in resolving references as well as in guiding semantic interpretation .
Post-processing maps the semantic interpretations onto templates, eliminating invalid fills (in this cas e
none), combining certain multiple references (in the attack on Alvarado), and "cleaning up" the final output .
Interpretation of Key Sentences
The TRUMP parser of the NLTooLSET successfully parsed and interpreted the first sentence (Si) and cor-
rectly applied conjunction reduction to get Cristiani as the accuser and get the `"SUSPECTED OR AC-
CUSED BY AUTHORITIES" fill. Embedded clauses are typically handled in much the same way as main
clauses, except that the main clauses often add information about the CONFIDENCE slot . The syste m
correctly treats the main event and the accusing as a single event, in spite of ignoring the definite referenc e
"THE CRIME" . In our system, linking an accusation (C-BLAME-TEMPLATE in the output below) to an
event is the default .
The following is the pre-processed input and final sentence-level interpretation of Si :

The next set of examples sentences (S11-13) are more difficult . There was one parser failure, with a
successful recovery . As we have mentioned, we correctly identify this as a new event based on tempora l
information, but filter out S12 because it has no explicit event reference . This is not a bug?this sort of
implicit target description is fairly infrequent, so we chose not to address it at this stage .

The system filters S21 (this is an omission, because "ESCAPED UNSCATHED" should be recognize d
as an effect), but successfully interprets S22 and resolves "ONE OF THEM" to "BODYGUARDS" . Note
that it is the pronoun "THEM", not "ONE", that gets resolved, using a simple reference resolution heuristi c
that looks for the most recent syntactically and semantically compatible noun phrase . However, this action
results in a penalty rather than a reward because the system does not tie the injury to the attack on Alvarad o
at the beginning of the story.

Some of the missing information in the response template comes from failing to tie information in t o
the main event or failing to recover implicit information . This is the case with the damage to the vehicle ,
which is described in passing, the children who were in Merino's home, and the driver who escaped unscathed .
Almost all the rest of the departures owe to some aspect of reference resolution?from failing to recognize th e
injury to the bodyguards as part of Alvarado ' s murder, to the extra fills "INDIVIDUAL" and "ATTORNE Y
GENERAL" that were co-referential with others . One of these turned out to be a simple bug, in that the titl e
"ATTORNEY GENERAL" in our system was interpreted as a different type (GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL )
from the noun phrase "ATTORNEY GENERAL" (LEGAL OR JUDICIAL) ; thus the system failed to unify
the references. However, the general problem of reference resolution is certainly one of the main areas wher e
future progress can come .
The other illustrative problem with this example is the degree to which relatively inconsequential fact s
can be pieced together into an interpretation . There is no theoretical reason why our system didn't know
about different forms of damage to vehicles, but we certainly wouldn ' t want to spend a lot of time encoding
this sort of knowledge . This turned out to be a rather tedious part of the MUC task . We did go so far as to
have template filling heuristics, for example, that tell the system: (1) When vehicles explode near buildings ,
it is the buildings and not the vehicles that are the targets, (2) When parts of buildings are destroyed o r
damaged (e.g . "the bomb shattered windows") this means that the buildings sustained some damage, an d
18 4
(3) When body parts are damaged (e .g . "the bomb destroyed his head"), it is the owner of the body part s
that is affected . However, such rules only scratch the surface of the reasoning that contributes to templat e
filling .
While the reference resolution problem is quite general and very interesting from a research perspective ,
the reasoning problem seems more MUC-specific, and it's hard to separate general reasoning issues from th e
peculiar details of the fill rules .
Aside from these problems, our system performed pretty well on this example, as for MUC on the whole .
The recall and precision for this message were both over .60, with the program recovering most of the
information from the text . As is typical from our MUC experience, the local processing of sentences was
very accurate and complete, while the general handling of story level details and template filling had som e
loose ends .
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
MUC-4 is a very difficult task, combining language interpretation at many levels with a variety of rules an d
strategies for template filling. The examples here illustrate some of the important characteristics of ou r
system as well as where future progress can be made . Not surprisingly, the major problems that remai n
after MUC-4 are very similar to the ones that we identified at the end of MUC-3 . This by itself might see m
discouraging, but the fact that the system did much better on MUC-4 suggests that we can expect mor e
improvements in the future . While there is a class of phenomena that we haven't really begun to address
(the body of world knowledge that contributes to interpreting events), there is also the ripe problem o f
interpreting text in context, in which MUC has given the field a leg up .
