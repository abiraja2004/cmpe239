Abstract
This paper investigates the use of prompt-
based content features for the automated as-
sessment of spontaneous speech in a spoken
language proficiency assessment. The results
show that single highest performing prompt-
based content feature measures the number
of unique lexical types that overlap with the
listening materials and are not contained in
either the reading materials or a sample re-
sponse, with a correlation of r = 0.450 with
holistic proficiency scores provided by hu-
mans. Furthermore, linear regression scor-
ing models that combine the proposed prompt-
based content features with additional spoken
language proficiency features are shown to
achieve competitive performance with scoring
models using content features based on pre-
scored responses.
1 Introduction
A spoken language proficiency assessment should
provide information about how well the non-native
speaker will be able to perform a wide range of tasks
in the target language. Therefore, in order to provide
a full evaluation of the non-native speaker?s speak-
ing proficiency, the assessment should include some
tasks eliciting unscripted, spontaneous speech. This
goal, however, is hard to achieve in the context of
a spoken language assessment which employs auto-
mated scoring, due to the difficulties in developing
accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) tech-
nology for non-native speech and in extracting valid
and reliable features. Because of this, most spo-
ken language proficiency assessments which use au-
tomated scoring have focused on restricted speech,
and have included tasks such as reading a word / sen-
tence / paragraph out loud, answering single-word
factual questions, etc. (Chandel et al, 2007; Bern-
stein et al, 2010).
In order to address this need, some automated
spoken language assessment systems have also in-
cluded tasks which elicit spontaneous speech. How-
ever, these systems have focused primarily on a non-
native speaker?s pronunciation, prosody, and fluency
in their scoring models (Zechner et al, 2009), since
these types of features are relatively robust to ASR
errors. Some recent studies have investigated the
use of features related to a spoken response?s con-
tent, such as (Xie et al, 2012). However, the ap-
proach to content scoring taken in that study requires
a large amount of responses for each prompt to be
provided with human scores in order to train the
content models. This approach is not practical for a
large-scale, high-stakes assessment which regularly
introduces many new prompts into the assessment?
obtaining the required number of scored training re-
sponses for each prompt would be quite expensive
and could lead to potential security concerns for the
assessment. Therefore, it would be desirable to de-
velop an approach to content scoring which does not
require a large amount of actual responses to train
the models. In this paper, we propose such a method
which uses the stimulus materials for each prompt
contained in the assessment to evaluate the content
in a spoken response.

2 Related Work
There has been little prior work concerning auto-
mated content scoring for spontaneous spoken re-
sponses (a few recent studies include (Xie et al,
2012) and (Chen and Zechner, 2012)); however, sev-
eral approaches have been investigated for written
responses. A standard approach for extended writ-
ten responses (e.g., essays) is to compare the con-
tent in a given essay to the content in essays that
have been provided with scores by human raters us-
ing similarity methods such as Content Vector Anal-
ysis (Attali and Burstein, 2006) and Latent Semantic
Analysis (Foltz et al, 1999). This method thus re-
quires a relatively large set of pre-scored responses
for each test question in order to train the content
models. For shorter written responses (e.g., short an-
swer questions targeting factual content) approaches
have been developed that compare the similarity be-
tween the content in a given response and a model
correct answer, and thus do not necessarily require
the collection of pre-scored responses. These ap-
proaches range from fully unsupervised text-to-text
similarity measures (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009) to
systems that incorporate hand-crafted patterns iden-
tifying specific key concepts (Sukkarieh et al, 2004;
Mitchell et al, 2002).
For extended written responses, it is less practical
to make comparisons with model responses, due to
the greater length and variability of the responses.
However, another approach that does not require
pre-scored responses is possible for test questions
that have prompts with substantial amounts of in-
formation that should be included in the answer. In
these cases, the similarity between the response and
the prompt materials can be calculated, with the hy-
pothesis that higher scoring responses will incorpo-
rate certain prompt materials more than lower scor-
ing responses. This approach was taken by (Gure-
vich and Deane, 2007) which demonstrated that
lower proficiency non-native essay writers tend to
use more content from the reading passage, which is
visually accessible and thus easier to comprehend,
than the listening passage. The current study inves-
tigates a similar approach for spoken responses.
3 Data
The data used in this study was drawn from TOEFL
iBT, an international assessment of academic En-
glish proficiency for non-native speakers. For this
study, we focus on a task from the assessment which
elicits a 60 second spoken response from the test
takers. In their response, the test takers are asked
to use information provided in reading and listen-
ing stimulus materials to answer a question concern-
ing specific details in the materials. The responses
are then scored by expert human raters on a 4-point
scale using a scoring rubric that takes into account
the following three aspects of spoken English pro-
ficiency: delivery (e.g., pronunciation, prosody, flu-
ency), language use (e.g., grammar, lexical choice),
and topic development (e.g., content, discourse co-
herence). For this study, we used a total of 1189
responses provided by 299 unique speakers to four
different prompts1 (794 responses from 199 speak-
ers were used for training and 395 responses from
100 speakers were used for evaluation).
4 Methodology
We investigated several variations of simple features
that compare the lexical content of a spoken re-
sponse to following three types of prompt materials:
1) listening passage: a recorded lecture or dialogue
containing information relevant to the test question
(the number of words contained in each of the four
listening passages used in this study were 213, 223,
234, and 318), 2) reading passage: an article or es-
say containing additional information relevant to the
test question (the number of words contained in the
two reading passages were 94 and 111), and 3) sam-
ple response: a sample response provided by the test
designers containing the main ideas expected in a
model answer (the number of words contained in the
four sample responses were 41, 74, 102, and 133).
The following types of features were investi-
gated for each of the materials: 1) stimulus cosine:
the cosine similarity between the spoken response
and the various materials, 2) tokens/response,
types/response: the number of word tokens / types
that occur in both the spoken response and each of
1Two out of the four tasks in this study had only listening
materials; responses to these tasks are not included in the results
for the features which require reading materials.
158
the materials, divided by the number of word to-
kens / types in the response,2 and 3) unique tokens,
unique types: the number of word tokens / types that
occur in both the spoken response and one or two
of the materials, but do not occur in the remaining
material(s).
As a baseline, we also compare the proposed
content features based on the prompt materials to
content features based on collections of scored re-
sponses to the same prompts. This type of feature
has been shown to be effective for content scoring
both in non-native essays (Attali and Burstein, 2006)
and spoken responses (Xie et al, 2012), and is com-
puted by comparing the content in a test response to
content models trained using responses from each of
the score points. It is defined as follows:
? Simi: the similarity score between the words
in the spoken response and a content model
trained from responses receiving score i (i ?
1, 2, 3, 4 in this study)
The Simi features were trained on a corpus of
7820 scored responses (1955 for each of the four
prompts), and we investigated two different meth-
ods for computing the similarity between the test
responses and the content models: Content Vector
Analysis using the cosine similarity metric (CVA)
and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI).
The spoken responses were processed using an
HMM-based triphone ASR system trained on 800
hours of non-native speech (approximately 15% of
the training data consisted of responses to the four
test questions in this study), and the ASR hypothe-
ses were used to compute the content features.3
5 Results
We first examine the performance of each of the
individual features by calculating their correlations
with the holistic English speaking proficiency scores
provided by expert human raters. These results for
2Dividing the number of matching word tokens / types by
the number of word tokens in the response factors out the over-
all length of the response from the calculation of the feature.
3Transcriptions were not available for the spoken responses
used in this study, so the exact WER of the ASR system is un-
known. However, the WER of the ASR system on a comparable
set of spoken responses is 28%.

As Table 1 shows, some of the individual content
features based on the prompt materials obtain higher
correlations with human scores than the baseline
CVA and PMI features based on scored responses.
Next, we investigated the overall contribution of the
content features to a scoring model that takes into
account features from various aspects of speaking
proficiency. To show this, we built a baseline lin-
ear regression model to predict the human scores us-
ing 9 features from 4 different aspects of speaking

Table 2: Baseline speaking proficiency features used in
the scoring model
In order to investigate the contribution of the vari-
ous types of content features to the scoring model,
linear regression models were built by adding the
features from each of the feature sets in Table 1 to
the baseline features. The models were trained using
the 794 responses in the training set and evaluated
on the 395 responses in the evaluation set. Table 3
presents the resulting correlations both for the indi-
vidual responses (N=395) as well as the sum of all
four responses from each speaker (N=97).5
As Table 3 shows, all of the scoring models us-
ing feature sets with the proposed content features
based on the prompt materials outperform the base-
line model. While none of the models incorporat-
ing features from a single feature set outperforms
the baseline CVA model using features based on
scored responses, a model incorporating all of the
proposed prompt-based content features, all prompt-
based, does outperform this baseline. Furthermore,
a model incorporating all of the content features
(both the proposed features and the baseline CVA /
PMI features), all content, outperforms a model us-

6 Discussion and Conclusion
This paper has demonstrated that the use of content
scoring features based solely on the prompt stimu-
lus materials and a sample response is a viable al-
ternative to using features based on content mod-
els trained on large sets of pre-scored responses for
the automated assessment of spoken language profi-
ciency. Under this approach, automated scoring sys-
tems for large-scale spoken language assessments
involving spontaneous speech can begin to address
an area of spoken language proficiency (content ap-
propriateness) which has mostly been neglected in
systems that have been developed to date. Com-
pared to an approach using pre-scored responses for
training the content models, the proposed approach
is much more cost effective and reduces the risk
that test materials will be seen by test takers prior
to the assessment; both of these attributes are cru-
cial benefits for large-scale, high-stakes language as-
sessments. Furthermore, the proposed prompt-based
content features, when combined in a linear regres-
sion model with other speaking proficiency features,
outperform a baseline set of CVA content features
which use models trained on pre-scored responses,
6While the prompt-based content features do result in im-
provements, neither of these two differences are statistically sig-
nificant at ? = 0.05 using the Hotelling-Williams Test, since
both the magnitude of the increase and the size of the data set
are relatively small.

and they add further improvement to a model incor-
porating the higher performing baseline with PMI
content features.
The results in Table 1 indicate that the indi-
vidual features based on overlapping lexical types
(types/response and unique types) perform slightly
better than the ones based on overlapping lexical to-
kens (tokens/response and unique tokens). This sug-
gests that it is important for test takers to use a range
of concepts that are contained in the stimulus mate-
rials in their responses. Similarly to the result from
(Gurevich and Deane, 2007), Table 1 also shows that
the features measuring overlap between the response
and the listening materials typically perform better
than the features measuring overlap between the re-
sponse and the reading materials; the best individ-
ual feature, LR?S? for unique types, measures the
amount of overlap with lexical types that are con-
tained in the listening stimulus, but absent from the
reading stimulus and sample response. This indi-
cates that the use of content from the listening ma-
terials is a better differentiator among students of
differing language proficiency levels than reading
materials, likely because test takers generally have
more difficulty understanding the content from lis-
tening materials.
Table 1 also shows the somewhat counterintu-
itive result that features based on no lexical over-
lap with the sample response produce higher corre-
lations than features based on lexical overlap with
the sample response, when there is lexical overlap
with the listening materials and no overlap with the
reading materials. That is, the LR?S? feature out-
performs the LR?S feature for both the unique types
and unique tokens features sets. However, as shown
in Section 4, the sample responses varied widely
in length (ranging from 41 to 133 words), and all
were substantially shorter than the listening materi-
als, which ranged from 213 to 318 words. Therefore,
it is likely that many of the important lexical items
from the sample response are also contained in the
listening materials. Thus, the LR?S feature provided
less information than the LR?S? feature.
The features used in this study are all based on
simple lexical overlap statistics, and are thus triv-
ial to implement. Future research will investigate
more sophisticated methods of text-to-text similar-
ity for prompt-based content scoring, such as those
used in (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009). Furthermore,
future research will address the validity of the pro-
posed features by ensuring that there are ways to fil-
ter out responses that are too similar to the stimulus
materials, and thus indicate that the test taker simply
repeated the source verbatim.
