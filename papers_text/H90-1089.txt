Robust Speech Recognition Technology 
Program Summary 
Principal Investigators: Clifford J. Weinstein and Douglas B. Paul 
MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high-performance 
continuous peech recognizer (CSR) techniques and systems focused on application in spoken lan- 
guage systems (SLS). A key supporting objective is to develop techniques for integration of CSR 
and natural anguage processing (NLP) systems in SLS applications. The CSR techniques are 
based on a continuous-observation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach, which has previously 
demonstrated high performance for normal speech and robustness for stressed speech. The motiva- 
tion is that current state-of-the-art CSR systems must be improved in performance and robustness 
for advanced SLS environments, with variabilities including those due to spontaneous speech, noise, 
and task-induced stress. The effort in CSR/NLP integration is focused on development of a struc- 
tured CSR/NLP interface, which will allow effective collaboration with and between other groups 
developing NLP and/or CSR systems. 
The Lincoln program began with a focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighter 
aircraft environment. A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with 
99% accuracy under stress conditions, representing more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in 
error rate relative to a baseline HMM system. A robust CSR system was then developed and 
integrated into a voice-controlled flight simulator - -  a simple, but a complete SLS involving a 
stressing, real-time task. The robust HMM recognition system was then adapted and extended 
to large vocabulary CSR. This effort has included development of a number of new modelling 
and recognition techniques which have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for both speaker- 
dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) recognition on the DARPA Resource Management 
(RM) database. 
Recent accomplishments include: (1) development of tied mixture techniques using observation 
pruning, which when incorporated with other improvements into the HMM recognizer, have yielded 
performance for both SD and SI training which is equivalent to the best reported on the October 
1989 RM test set; (2) development and implementation, i  initial prototype form, of a structured 
CSR/NLP interface including the required protocols, the stack decoder control structure, and initial 
CSR and NLP simulators to allow testing; (3) development of effective and efficient stack decoder 
search strategies for continuous speech recognition; and (4) analysis of the interaction between true 
source, training, and testing language models, and the effect of this interaction on performance 
testing of CSR systems; and (5) development of a new phonetic ontext model, the semiphone, which 
produces results similar to traditional triphone systems, but which allows significant reduction in 
the number of models which must be trained. 
Plans for the current program include: (1) continue to improve HMM CSR performance using 
tied-mixture techniques, new semiphone techniques to reduce the number of states which must 
be trained, and new acoustic-phonetic modelling and recognition techniques; (2) complete the 
development of the new stack decoder control structure, and convert he HMM CSR to this control 
structure; (3) complete the prototype implementation f the CSR/NLP interface, and collaborate 
with other groups in application of this interface to integration of CSR and NLP systems developed 
at different sites.
