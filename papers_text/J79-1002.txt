Thc N T T T  Linguistic String 1>arscr (1,SI') is a ~vorldng system for the syntactic analysis 
of Ehglish scicntifie tests. It consists of a parsing program, a large-coverage b~glish gram- 
mar,  and a Icsicon. Thc gramnlarls effcctivcncss in parsing texts is due in large part to a 
substantial Imdy of detail cvl \vc.Il -formedness rcst rictions which eliminate most incorrect syn- 
tactic parses which would be allo~vecl by a weaker grammar. The restrictions mainly test for 
compatible combinations of word subclasses. 
This paper dcfines the 109 adjective, noun and verb suhclasscs. These subolasses, as 
\'ell as others not prcscnted herc, are defined Ln such a way that they can he used as a guide 
for dassifymg new entries to the LSP lexicon and as a lingpistic reference twl. Fach defi- 
nition lncludcs a statement of the intent of tllc subclass, a diawostic frame, sentence examples 
and a worcl list draun from tho present dictionary. The subclasses are defined tro reflect pre- 
cisely the grammatical propertics tested for by the restrictiol~s of the grammar Where neces- 
sary for clariking the intent of the subclass, three additiollal criteria are employed: excision, 
implicit and co- rcfcrcncc, and paraphrase. The subclasscs have been defined so as to be con- 
sistent with a subsecluent stage of transformational analysis rilzicl~ is  currently being imp1 e -

The Lesical Subclasses of the Linguistic String Parser 
Eileen Fitzpatricl; and Naomi Sager 
New Yorl; University 
This paper defines the 109 adjective, noun and verb subclasses of the NYU Ling~~istic 
String Parser (LSP) The su~classes have bee11 treated here in such a way that they can be 
used as a guide for classifying new words for the lexicon ahd as a lineistic reference tool. 
Each entry bebm provides a definition of the subclass, a diagnostic frame, sentence examples. 
and a word list d r a m  from the lexicon of the computer-grammar (ca 10,000 word entries). 
The subclasses are defined in terms of string grammar. In string analysis, a sentence 
is decomposed into an elementary sentence, or center string, and adjunct strings. Iil a string, 
each word class may bapreceded or followed by left or right adjunct  string^,^ and the center 
string as a whole may have adjunct strings ?vhich precede or follow the center string or  occur 
at interior parts of the string. A string grammar makes restrictions as to which subclasses 
can co-occur. The subclass definitions, therefo~e, are based mainly on these ocburrence 
possibilities (e.g., a count noun is specitied as a noun which camiot occur without a preceding 
article). 
More precisely, the entire computer grammar consists of a set of approximately 200 
contest-free (BND definitions, a set of a b u t  250 restrictions, and a \lord dictionary. The 
BNF definitions define the center and adjunct strings of the language as well as sentence 
nominalization (embedded sentence) strings u;hich may occur in subject, object or  complement 
position. In parsing a sentence, once an element of a string (e.g., SUBJECT, VERB, or 
OBJECT) has been identified in the sentence, restrictioi~s are invoked to test.various pro- 
perties, including the subclasses of the words ivithin this element or within this element and 
an element previously identified. 
When a word is classified for the LSP lexicon it must be assigned to the syntactic classe 
(N, V, etc.) which appear in the context-free definitions-and to the specific subclasses (e.g., 
count noun) which are tested for by the restrictions. The trames and definitions are a com- 
pact statement of these constraints. Fbr reference to the computer grammar, we have used 
the code names of strings and restrictions, bttt the text can be read independently of the re- 
ferenced material, 
The strings have roughly mnemonic names. An explanation of some of the mnemonics 
used in the text is included in the rererence guide which follows this introduction. 
The restrictions referred to are of several main types: agreement restrictions (AGREI 
noun phrase restrictions (N) , position restrictions (POS) , quantifier restrictions (Q) , selectior 
restrictions (SEL) , restrictions on sentence embedding (SN) . and WH-string restrictions m) 
The name of each restriction is preceded by a W or D and followed by an integer, e.g.: WAGR 
'~fi addition to the Noun, Adjective and Verb classes, the other major classes are 
Adverb, Pronoun, Quantifier, Article, Subordinate Conjunction and Preposition. Coordinate 
Conjunctions and comparative connectives are treated individually. 
9 LIn this text, as in the LSP grammar, the notation LXTl (X being a wdrd class, e.g., 
N noun V verb, etc.) stands for X appearing with its optional left adjuncts (LX) and optional 
right adjuncts (RX). X is called the host of its adjunct strings. Thus, old men with canes is 
an instance ot LNR in which old -is a left adjunct of the host N man, and with caneq is a right 
-
adjunct of the host N man. 
-
While a subclass is precisely defined by its appearance in the restrictions gf the 
grammar, a person who is classifying words for the lexicon may need additional criteria 
in order to capture the intent oi the subclass. This is particularly true in defining the verb 
subclasses which specify the object strings with which a verb can occur (the OBJIIIST of 
the test). Here the frames and restrictions may not suffice to distinguish occurrences of 
the words as instances of the subclass from other possible occurrences covered by the 
grammar. 
For example, it is important to distinguish an object string occurrence of SVINGO 
insdney kept people working overtime from a non-object-string occurrence of the same word- 
class sequence,' e.g., one consistingof a noun with its adjunct such as N + reducea relative 
VINGO in  They fired people working overtime. Of course, some verbs will have ambiguous 
occurrences, e.g. ,"keep in the first example. It would' be incorrect, however. to class - fire 
as occurring with a SVINGO object on the basis of the second exzmple. We haye therefore 
used additional criteria in defining the object strings in order to clarify the intent of par- 
ticular subclasses. The criteria used are: 
(1) Ekcision. In an occurrence of an element with its adjunct in a sentence, the adlunct 
can be excised leaving a well-formed sentence unchanged in meaning and selection from the 
original sentence (except for detail added by the adjunct). Thus, we can test whether a word 
sequence in a sentence is an object string occurrence by excising the portion which might 
be an Wjunct. If the remaining sentence is either different in grammaticality , meaning d r  
selection from the original sentence, then the sequence as a whole is cansidered an object 
strifig occurrence. Fbr our purposes, i f  the sequence is an object string octurrence, then 
the verb with which it occurs must be sulxlassed for that object string. For example, - line, 
show and c a r x m u s t  be subclassed as occurring with the particle string D P ,  and walk not, 
-
s inc e 
They lined up. 
$ They lined. 
He showed off. 
He showed. (difference in meahing) 
He cam fed on. 
The point easried. (difference in selection) 
He walked on. 
He walked. (no difference in grammaticality, selection or 
meaning) 
(2) Understood reference. If a given noun in  one sequence-occurrence is understood 
as referring to a particular noun N, and, in a different occurrence as referring to an N,, 
the two occurrences must not be considered as ilistances of the same string. For example, 
since messengers in (1) refers to they and messengers in (2) refers to boys, the t~vo occur- 
rences of as - N must n& be considered a s  the same string: 
(r) They served the boys a$ messengers. 
(2) They treated the boys as messengers. 
(3) Paraphrase. If a semantic contrast can be found in otherwise identical sequeilces, 
then these sequences cannot be considered as instances of the same string when subclassing 
 he term %equencen applies to word sequences the structural description of nhich 
is under discussion. 
a verb. For example, the a s  which is equivalent to 'in the capacity oft in (3 )  functions as 
part of the object string A ~ B J B I . : ,  while the as  -which is  equivalent to 'when' in (4) func- 
tions as part of an adjunct which does not restrict the verl~: 
(3). John served as  a lieutenant. 
(4) Jollll c h a ~  a s  a lieutenant. 
hie to the difficulty of judging the appropriateness of a paraphrase, h o ~ ~ e v e r  n.e have 
used this criterion sparingly. 
As we have noted, the frames and definitions precisely reflect the use of the. major 
classes and subclasses in the presently implemented string grammar. However, it should 
also be noted that this grammar, and the associated lexical categories, have been defined 
so a s  to be consistent with a, subsequent stage of transformational analysis which is currently 
being implemented. lh some cases, the same string form has several transformational 
sources; where this affects the dictionary classification, we have noted it. 
Something should be said a b u t  the form of the dictionary entries as they appear in 
the computer lexicon. Each word is classified for all its major class occurrences (N, V, 
eCc.) and its subc~asses within each major class. The classification is based on the usage 
of the word in the language as a wllole, not its use in a particular text. Ho\vever, purely 
coIloquia1 and literary uses have not been covered because of the intended application to 
scientific tex-ts. 
The classificatio~~s of the niords are arranged in a hierarchical structure: the malor 
classes may have subelasses and the subclasses in turn may have subclasses. Fbr esample, 
the adjective - clear, which can occur as the predicate of a,sentential subject, is in the sub- 
class AS ENT1. The particular type of sentential subjects clear occurs with (IVH and THAT 
embeddings) require that it be classified in the two subclasses A\i7H and ATIlAT of ASENTI. 
This part of the lesical entry appears a s  follows: 
CLEAR 
ADJ: (ASENTI : (AWH, AT-W3) 
or alternatively : 
CLEAR 
ADJ: . l o .  
10 = ASENT.1: (AWH, ATHAT). 
where the particular line number a s s i w  (.lo) is arbitrary. Where this type of further 
subdivision of a subclass is i;acessary, a sample dictionary entry is provided along with 
the definitions and frames below. 
It should be noted that while the entries in the lexicoh are  by word rather than stem 
the word entries based on a particular stem can refer to portions of a basic entry which 
they share in common, e.g., the object list of a verb (OBJLIST) is specified once for all 
forms df the verb (tensed verb tV, - present participle Ving, past participle - Ven and infinitive 
V). - 
The notational conventions used in the subclass definitions and frames are  as follows: 
2 - an ungrammatical sequence 
x - - x Rhe underlined term) is the class being subclassed in the frame o r  a 
particular lexical item used in the frame. 
s - - s (the double undarlin.ec1 term) is the class being subclassed in the 
- 
frame where the frame also contains a particular lexical item 
(X) - in a franc! an optional element 
(S) - in a demition, a further subdivision of a subclass 
T - article 
D - adverb 
OBJ - a cover tcrm for all. the object strings (see ol~jcct string reference wide) 
Sh" - an embedded sentence of the following types: 
TEIATS '- That John was here 
FORTOVO - f q r  Mary to go 
TOVO - to live 
SVINGO - then1 worlring overtime 
C l  SIIOULD - that John b-e here 
S W I ~  - \ ~ l ~ ~ t h q + j  ~ v l i y /  how. . .he went 
It should also be noted tM-? the specified frame which delimits a word is not the only frame 
in ~vhid.~ fhiZt word can occur; it serves merely as the test frame when classifying words. 
The presellt paper is an outgrowth of ongoing work on the LSP lexicon throughout its 
various implementations and applications since 19G5. It draws particularly an a previous 
write-up of the LSP g r a m r  (fl. Sager, " i Computer String Grammar of Ehglish" ,ring 
Program Report No. 4 ,  Linguistic String Project, New York University, 1968), diagnostic 
frames prepared for LSP use by Barbara Anderson, and classification work by many members 
of the LSP staff over the years.

OBJLIST:. (ASOWBE) : 
The object string ASOBJBE must be 
distinguished from the adjwlct sequence 
as  -t NSTGO. The two may be distinguished 
-
by the fact that the as -of the ASOBJBE string 
is parapl~~asable as 'in the capacity or  char- 
acter of1, e.g., 
They servcd as InessenTers. 
in the capacity or nlessengers 
whereas the - as of the adjtmct sequence is 
pamplirasable as 'when1 or rwl~ile e.g., 
They served as young men. 
when they were young men 
The two may also be distinguished by 
the fact that in sentences containing the 
ASOBJBE string, the primary stress of the 
sentence falls on the head noun of tie noun 
phrase functioning as the OBJBE, e.g., 
Enzymes function as catalysts. 
3 Enzymes fwlction as catalysts. 
tvhereas, in sentences containing the adjunct 
sequence, the primary sentence stress falls 
on the verb, e.g., 
John cllangc(1 as  a lieutenant. 
ij John changed as a lieutenant. 
Examples : 
They served as messengers. 
Enzymes function as catalysts. 
He can act -a i  bartender. 
This ide-iginated as a vague possibility. 
That invention began as a joke. 
John applied as a mechanic.

2) passive V* + (OBJ) (War was never

of t h e  passive construction in  scientific writing, 
it is more economical to list the passive objects
