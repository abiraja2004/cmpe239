Abst ract  
A reasonably simple, domain-independent, 
large-scale approach of lexictd semantics to 
paraphrase recognition is presented in this pa- 
per. It relies on the enrichment of morpho- 
syntactic rules and the addition of fbur boolean 
syntactico-semantic features to a set of 1.,(}23 
words. It results in a significant enhancement 
of precision of 30% with a slight decrease in re- 
call of 10%. 
1 Overv iew 
The recognition ,of paraphrases and variants is 
an important issue in several areas of infornm- 
tion retrieval and text mlderstanding. Merging 
paraphrastic sentences ilnproves ummarization 
by avoiding redundancy (Barzilay et al, 1999). 
Term variant conilation enhances recall in in- 
tbrmation retrieval by pointing at documents 
that contain linguistic variants of (tuery terms 
(Arampatzis et al, 1998). 
In (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999), a 
technique is proposed for the conflation of 
morpho-syntactic variants that relies solely on 
morphological and low-level syntactic features 
(part-of-speech category, munber agreement, 
morphological relationships, and phrase struc- 
ture). An analysis of these results shows the 
limitation of this approach: correct and incor- 
rect variants cannot be separated satisfactorily 
on a purely morpho-syntactic basis. Sonic addi- 
tional lexical semantics must be taken into con- 
sideration. 
In this study we propose a reasonably sim- 
ple, domain-independent, large-scale approach 
of lexical semantics to noun-to-verb variant 
recognition. It relies on the mere addition of 
two t)oolean syntactic features to 449 verbs and 
two boolean morpho-semantic features to 574 
nouns. It result,; in a significant enhancement 
of precision of 30% with a slight decrease in re- 
call of 10%. This new al)proaeh to semantics-- 
human-based, ettlcient, involving simple linguis- 
tic tbatures --convincingly illustrates the posi- 
tive role of linguistic knowledge in information 
processing. It confirms that verbs and their se- 
mantics play a significant role in document anal- 
ysis (Klavans and Kan, 1998). 
2 Morpho-syntactic Approach to 
Nomino-verba l  Var ia t ion  
In order to illustrate the contribution of se- 
mantics to the detection of paraphrastic struc- 
tures, we focus on a specific type of wtriation: 
the vo.rl)al varbmts of Noun-Preposition-Noun 
terms o1" compounds in French. For example, 
les corttraintes rdsiduellcs darts les coques sont 
anaIysdes (the residual constraints in the shells 
~re mialyzed) is such a vert)al variant of analyse 
de corttraintc (constraint analysis). 
As a baseline tbr the extr~mtion of these vari- 
ants, we use a set of five morpho-syntactic rans- 
tbrmations fbr Noun-Preposition-Noun terms 
reported in (Jacquemin and Tzoukernlann, 
1999) (see Table 1). 1 We use the no- 
tation Ad(Ni)v for |;tie inorphological ink 
between the initial term and the trans- 
ibrmed structure. It rel)resents any verb 
in the same morphological fanfily as Ni. 
For instance, in English, and according 
to the CELEX database, Ad(analysis)v = 
{to analyze, to psychoanalyze}. 
Given a NI P2 N8 structure, these transt'ornm- 
tions are obtained through corpus-based tuning 
1The following symbols are used for syntactic ate- 
gories: N (nouI0, A (adjective), Av (adverb), V (verb), C 
(coordinating conjunction), P (pret}osition), and D (de- 
tcrminer). In the regular exl}ressions, ? denotes option- 
ality and I disjunction. Morphologically related words 
are underlined.

and correspond basically to tbur configurations: 
1. either N1 or Na (re, st)cct;ivcly head and 
modifier of the initial term) is I;r~msformed 
into a morphologically related verb V, 
2. the order of the two content words is re- 
tained or reversed, 
3. the dependency relation 1)etween 1;11(; two 
initial 11011118 is preserved. 
For instance, rule NheadqlbVl/,ev corresl)onds 
to transfi)rmations in whi(:h the, head noun 
is morphologically re,1;~t(;d to the verl) and 
t:h(; ord('r of the two words is re, verse(l; rul(; 
Nmodit'FoV (modifier transfi)rmed, order r(;- 
rained) has been divided into two sul)ruh;s: the 
first one - Nmo(tifYoV1 - re, quires the insertion 
of a pr(;positiou just 1)eft)re th(; verbal form. 
3 The L imi ts  o f  the  
Morpho-syntact i c  A I )p roach  
In the tirst step of this work, we ext)e(:ted th(, 
precision of wu:iant recoglfition to be controlled 
in two ways: firstty, by searching fi)r multi- 
term variants in which the two content words of 
the initial term are foulM, directly or via mor- 
1)hological transformation. Se(:ondly, by dell1> 
ing morpho-syntacti(: pa|;te.rns of variation in 
I;erms of l)art-of-sl)eech strings that are allowed 
to come in 1)e.tween these t;wo COlll;eltt words. 
Yet, the sequences found on su(;h a morl)ho- 
synl;acti(: basis prove to 1)e of wtrying quality 
regarding their at/ility to t)rovide t)arat)hrases 
of the initial l;erm. Consider for instance some 
of l;he vm:imlts del, eeted for the term comparai- 
son de rds'ultat (comparison of results), in which 
only t;11(; \[irst; |;we sequences are good variants: 
compare les rdsultats ((:onlpare the results) 
(rule Nhead~lbV, pattern A4 (N1)vDNa) 
r&ultats ezpdrirnc.ntauz sent compar& (exI)er- 
imental results are compared) (rule Nhead- 
toVRev, 1)atte.rn NaAVA4 (N~)v) 
com, pard.s a'ux 'rds'.,ltats (COmlmred to 
the results) (rule NheadToV, pattern 
Jt4(N1)vPN:{) 
rds'ultd d"unc eomparaison (resulted from ;t 
comparison) (rule NModiiToVRev, pattern 
J~d (Na)vPDN1 )
Such examples show that morpho-syntactie 
patterns ;~re 1;oo coarse-gr~tined to ensure l;hat 
the dependency relation between the two piv- 
ots (results is the object of the prediea?e com- 
parison) is maintained. When trying to detine 
linguistic criteria to ewfluate such w~riants, it; 
apt)ears that the frontier between good and load 
variants lies between those that preserve the ar- 
gument relation 1)etween the two content words 
and those that disrupt it. This means that, in 
the verbal wtriant, the. argument relation be- 
tween the verb and l;he noun must be l;he same 
as t;he relal;io11 between the deverl)al lOUll add 
the othe.r noun in the nominal term. 
None of the five rules ensures that the subcat- 
egorization frame is preserved. For instance, if 
we consider t;11o rule NModifI'oVl{ev, we find se- 
265 
quences that obey this constraint and sequences 
that violate it2: 
cr'itdrc d'&aluation (evaluation criterion) -+ 
dvalv, dselon les crit~r'cs (evahmted according to 
the criteria) 
syst~me d'dvaluation (evaluation system) *--+ 
dvaht6 lc syst&ne (evaluated the system) 
In the second case, the transtbrmation is un- 
acceptable because the instrumental relation ex- 
pressed in the nonfinal term becomes an ob- 
ject relation in the verbal sequence. Even 
when word order is preserved, the relation be- 
tween the pivots can be totally different in the 
term and its transformation, as i.u: contrgIe 
d'installation (installation control) and contrgle 
ccntralisd installd (installed centralized control) 
(rule NModitToV2). 
Our aim was to tbrmulate additional con- 
straints in order to control argument structure 
preservation. We thus had to cope with prob- 
lem of handling nonfinal t)hrases (NP) in which 
one of the elements is morphologically inked to 
a verb. In French, as in English, the seman- 
tics of these nominal phrases is an issue tbr lin- 
guistic description: the two nouns can be linked 
by the whole range of argmnent-predicate rela- 
tions, and very few linguistic elements can be 
used to decide what relation is expressed. Here 
is a brief list of the configurations that are likely 
to appear in such NPs: 
- the second noun is the object of the first; one: 
comparaison de rdsultat (comparison of result) 
- the second noun is the subject of the first 
one: augmentation de I'intcv, sitd (increase in in- 
tensity) 
- the second noun is an adjunct: tr'aitcment g
la chaleur (treating with heat) 
the first noun is an adjunct: taux 
d'augmentation (increase rate) 
Our aim was to find a way to use surface lin- 
guistic knowledge, as required in such an area 
of NLP, to deal with the interpretation of these 
phrases. 
4 Light Semant ics  for 
Nomino-verba l  Variat ions 
Our approach consisted of two steps: firstly, 
defining semantic lues tbr accepting or discard- 
sin what follows~ the symbols --~ and *----> respectively 
indicate correct and incorrect ransformations 
ing variants and, secondly, defining new varia- 
tion patterns based oll these features. 
4.1 F i l ter ing  Cr i te r ia  
First, using linguistic results on the semantics 
of French NPs (Fabre, 1996; Bartning, 1990), 
we identified predicate-argument configurations 
that cannot be matched by a given pattern ('re- 
ject' heuristics in the sense of (Lapata, 1999)). 
For example, when rule NmodifToVRev applies, 
N1 de N3 terms cannot be i)araphrased by ver- 
bal sequences in which N1 is the ol)ject of the 
verb, as in: ezp&iencc d'utilisation (experiment 
of use) *-+ utilisait 'uric ezpdrier~,cc (used an ex- 
periment). In such a configuration, only non-- 
thematic arguments (adjuncts) of the deverbal 
noun may be tbund inside the NP. 
Similarly, when rule NheadToVRev applies, 
N\] de N3 terms cannot be paraphrased by ver- 
bal sequences in which N\] is the subject of a 
transitive verb, as in: utilisation de l'ezp&'icnce 
(use of experiment) *-+ czpdriencc utilisant (ex- 
t)eriment using). 
This configuration provides variants only 
when the verb is intransitive or ergative: erga- 
tive verbs allow tbr alternations of the tbrm: NP 
V (la dcnsitd au.qrncntc) / one V NP (on awl- 
monte la dcnsitd). 
In this case, the tbllowing transtbrmation is 
correct: augmentation de densitd (density in- 
crease) / de,,,,s'itd av,9'mentc (density increases). 
4.2 Enriched Metarules 
Once it has 1)een established wtfich transforma- 
tions should be rejected, we searched tbr sur- 
face linguistic clues that could help us to fil- 
ter out these undesirable variants. It led us to 
the redefinition of the metarules, in two ways: 
putting additional constraints on the part-of  
speech strings that can intervene between the 
two pivots, and defining new features to add lin- 
guistic control upon the application of the rules. 
These t~atures are: the prepositional form, the 
morphological type of the noun, the transitivity 
of the verb, and the voice (active versus pas- 
sive). 
Here are two examples tbr the redefinition of 
the metarules (fllrther details and examples are 
given in table 3): 
ru le Nmodi fToVRev In this case, the 
metarule is transtbrmed into a single 
266 
17elilled rule, in whi('h the ('oml)ilm|:ion 
of parts of sl)eech is mot(; res|;riel;ed: a 
preposition is required to elinfinate object

rule NheadToVRev Here, the initial 
metarule is refined into three em'iched 
rules, mainly by means of lexical con- 
straints on the verb tbrm. Only N1 P2 Na

5 Exper iments  and  Eva luat ions  
In this section, we ew~luate the variations pro- 
duced fl'om the two preceding sets of metarules:

MS) m~d new wn:i~tions enriched through light;

tra(:ted from a l l -word window (9 intervening

In order to calculate the precision and recall of 
the rich and poor metarules and to estimate the 
gains of semantic enrichment, a set of 1,000 co- 
occurrences has been randomly chosen among 
the 159,898 co-occurrences retrieved by the sys- 
tem. They have been divided into three sets: 
S1 (500 co-occurrences) and S2 and S~ (250 co-

dently by the two judges (i.e. the two authors)

The achtition of semantics results in an in- 
(:,'ease of precision of 0.29: from 0.499 fbr MS 
to 0.789 for MS+S. The corresl)onding decrease 
of recall is nm(:h smaller: 0.11 from 0.696 for 
MS to 0.586 for MS+S. Pre(:ision and recall can 
t)e (:onfloine(t into a single me,mute such as the 
eifeetiveness measure E~ given by Fonmfla (1) 
in which t~ is a parameter (0 _< a < 1) (van 
Rijsbergen, 1975): 
Ea = 1 - (1) 
E~ varies fl:om 0 to 1.0. Low wflues of Ea cor- 
respond to combined high recall and high preci- 
I in order to assign an equal sion. If we use oe = 
trot)or|ante to precision and recall, the E1 val- 
ues are 0.419 fi)r MS and 0.327 for MS+S. They 
indicate that the addition of semantics has sig- 
nificantly improved the quality of w~riant ex- 
traction. Detailed values of recall and precision 
arc; showll ill Table 5. 
Agreement  on Judgment  
Agreement on ~ classification task can 1)e mea- 
sured through the kappa coefficient (K). It 
ewduato.s the pairwise agreement mnong a set; 
of coders making category .iudgment, correcting 
tbr expected chance agreement (Carletta, 1996). 
In our case the results of the ternary class|It- 
cation task are given by Table 6. The simple 
kappa cecil|(tent is 
Po-  P,! 
K : - -  (2 )  
I -P~.  
7232. in which P0 = E i~ and < = Ei( ,/ ~2~-) (Co- 
hen, 1960). P0 is the proportion of times the 
coders agree and I~, is the proportion of tiines 
we would expect them to agree by chance. The 
value of the kappa coetficient is 0.91 indicating

tic phenomena.  The problem of linguistic vari- 
at ion in information processing forces the lin- 
guist to reconsider parat)hrase and trm~sf'orma- 
tion mechanisms in a new perspective, based 
on real l inguistic data  and on systematic ort)us 
exploration. The  paraphrase judgment  is eval- 
uated in a new way, from a practical point of 
view: two sequences are said to be a paraphrase 
of each other if the user of an information sys- 
tem considers that  they bring identical or sin> 
ilar informat ion content. Regarding linguistic 
methodology, this work led us to find "l ight" so- 
lutions in terms of lexical encoding to describe 
complex semantic t)henomena. This approach is 
pronfising because it demonstrates that  linguis- 
tic knowledge can really enhance the results of 
term recognit ion beyond the ,norphology level, 
and that  semantics can be taken into account 
to sonm extent.
