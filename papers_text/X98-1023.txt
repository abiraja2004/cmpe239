Abstract 
We discuss those techniques which, in the 
opinion of the authors, are needed to support 
robust automatic summarization. Many of 
these methods are already incorporated in a 
multi-lingual summarization system, MINDS, 
developed at CRL. The approach is sentence 
selection, but includes techniques to improve 
coherence and also to perform sentence reduc- 
tion. Our methods are in distinct contrast o 
those approaches to summarization by deep 
analysis of a document followed by text gener- 
ation.

1 Introduction 
Summarization is the problem of presenting the 
most important information contained in one or 
more documents. The research described here 
focuses on multi-lingual summarization (MLS). 
Summaries of documents are produced in Spanish, 
Japanese, English and Russian using the same 
basic summarization engine. 
The core summarization problem is taking a 
single text and producing a shorter text in the same 
language that contains all the main points in the 
input text. We are using a robust, graded approach 
to building the core engine by incorporating statis- 
tical, syntactic and document structure analyses 
among other techniques. We have developed a sys- 
tem design which allows the parameterization both 
of the summarization process and of necessary 
information about he languages being processed. 
Document structure analysis (Salton & Singal 
94, Salton et al 95) is important for extracting the 
topic of a text. In a statistical analysis for example 
(Paice 90, Paice & Jones 93), titles and sub-titles 
would be given a more important weight than the 
body of the text. Similarly, the introduction and 
conclusion for the text itself and for each section 
are more important han other paragraphs, and the 
first and last sentences in each paragraph are more 
important han others. The applicability of these 
depends on the style adopted in a particular 
domain, and on the language: the stylistic structure 
and the presentation of arguments vary signifi- 
cantly across genres and languages. Structure anal- 
ysis must be tailored to a particular type of text in a 
particular language. In the MINDS system docu- 
ment structure analysis involves the following sub- 
tasks: 
? Language Identification 
? Document Structure Parsing 
? Multilingual Sentence Segmentation 
? Text Structure Heuristics 
In order to allow a multitude of techniques to 
contribute to sentence selection, the core engine 
adopts a flexible method of scoring the sentences 
in a document by each of the techniques and then 
ranking them by combining the different scores. 
Text-structure based heuristics provide the main 
method for ranking and selecting sentences in a 
document. These are supplemented by word fre- 
quency analysis methods. 
The core engine is designed in such a way that 
as additional resources, such as lexical and other 
knowledge bases or text processing and MT 
engines, become available from other ongoing 
research efforts they can be incorporated into the 
overall multi-engine MINDS system. The most 
promising components are part of speech tagging, 
anaphora resolution, and semantic methods to 
allow concept identification to supplement word 
171 
frequency analysis. Part of speech tagging has 
already been used to perform sentence length 
reduction by stripping out "superfluous" words and 
phrases. The other methods will be used to main- 
tain document coherence, and to improve sentence 
selection and reduction. 
In this paper we describe the architecture and 
performance of the current system and our plans 
for incorporating new NLP methods. 
2 MINDS - Mul t i -L ingual  Interact ive 
Document  Summar izat ion  
2.1 Background 
The need for summarization tools is especially 
strong if the source text is in a language different 
from the one(s) in which the reader is most fluent. 
Interactive summarization of multilingual docu- 
ments is a very promising approach to improving 
productivity and reducing costs in large-scale doc- 
ument processing. This addresses the scenario 
where an analyst is trying to filter through a large 
set of documents to decide quickly which docu- 
ments deserve further processing. This task is more 
difficult and expensive when the documents are in 
a foreign language in which the analyst may not be 
as fluent as he or she is in English. The task is even 
more difficult when the documents are in several 
different languages. For example, the analyst's task 
may be to filter through newspaper a ticles in many 
different languages published on a particular day to 
generate a report on different nations' reactions to a 
current international event, such as a nuclear test 
on the previous day. This last task is currently 
infeasible for a single analyst, unless he or she 
understands each one of those languages, since 
machine translation (MT) of entire documents can- 
not yet meet he requirements of such a task. Multi- 
lingual summarization (MLS) introduces the 
possibility of translating a summary rather than the 
entire document to the language of the summary 
(i.e., English). We hope that MLS and MT can 
mutually benefit from one another since summari- 
zation offers MT the benefit of not having to trans- 
late entire texts and also spares a user from having 
to read through an entire document produced by an 
MT system. 
2.2 Overview 
The MINDS system is a multilingual domain 
independent summarization system, which is able 
to summarize documents written in English, Japa- 
nese, Russian and Spanish. The system is intended 
to be rapidly adaptable to new language and genres 
by adjusting a set of parameters. A summarization 
system for Turkish has just been added to the sys- 
tem. This required about one programmer day of 
effort, mostly spent in preprocessing the language

resources used by the system. The types of summa- 
rization information used are also intended to be 
adjustable by a user "on the fly", to allow the tun- 
ing of the summarizers output based on length of 
summary needed, type of document structure, topic 
focus. 
The MINDS summarization system is com- 
posed of four stages. First we have an Input Pro- 
cess stage, whose main function is to get the 
relevant text in the document in UNICODE encod- 
ing. The second stage is a Document Structuring 
Stage, where paragraph and sentence recognition, 
and word tokenization are performed. All the infor- 
mation about the document structure is stored in a 
"Document Object" that will be used in the Sum- 
marization-Translation stage. In the Summariza- 
tion-Translation Stage, the text is summarized 
using sentence xtraction techniques, where the 
sentence scoring and ranking is mainly based on 
text-structure based heuristics supplemented by 
word frequency analysis methods and in some 
cases by information from a Name Recognition 
module. Once the summary is ready in the original

language, MINDS uses MT engines from other 
ongoing CRL projects to translate the summary to 
English. The final stage is the Output Process that 
generates the summary output form; SGML, 
HTML, or Plain text. This may also involve con- 
version from UNICODE to the original encoding 
of the document. 
2.3 Input Process Stage 
In the input stage, MINDS can accept docu- 
ments written in different languages and codesets: 
currently English, Japanese, Russian, Turkish and 
Spanish. Also the documents can be in different 
formats such as SGML, HTML, E-mail or Plain 
text. A parsing stage identifies the document's 
format, selects and applies the appropriate parser 
and extracts the relevant ext from the document. 
Once we have the text to be summarized a lan- 
guage recognition module determines the language 
in which the document is written and the text 
encoding used in the document. Given the encod- 
ing of the document the text is converted to UNI- 
CODE and all the rest of the processing is carried 
out on the UNICODE version of the text. 
2.4 Document Structuring Stage 
After the text to be summarized is available in 
UNICODE encoding, its structure needs to be 
determined. This is the job of the Document Struc- 
turing Stage. In this stage, three tokenization 
stages are performed. The first one pose of identi- 
fies the paragraphs in the document. The second 
tokenization stage identifies entences within each 
paragraph. To identify sentence boundaries for 
many languages requires a list of abbreviations for 
the language. Languages such as Chinese and Japa- 
nese have an unambiguous " top" character and 
thus do not present his problem. Finally, word 
tokenization is carried out to identify individual 
words in each sentence. Here Chinese and Japa- 
nese which do not use spaces between words 
require some segmentation method to be applied. 
The current system actually uses two character 
pairs, bi-grams, for all its calculations for Japanese. 
These bi-grams are produced starting at every char- 
acter position in the document. 
All the structuring information is stored in a 
"Document Object", which is the main data struc- 
ture of the system, holding all the information gen-

erated during the processing. After the 
tokenization stage is complete and depending on 
the lexical resources available for each language, 
other stages are performed, such as Morphology, 
Proper Name Recognition and Tagging. 
2.5 Summarizat ion-Translat ion Stage 
In the Summarization-Translation Stage, the 
importance of each sentence in the document is 
determined using a scoring procedure, which 
assigns scores to the sentences according to the 
position of the sentences in the document structure 
and according to the occurrences of key-words in 
the sentence which belong to the set of most fre- 
quent words in the document that are not in a "stop 
list" (the most frequent words in a language are 
considered irrelevant). We make the assumption 
that these key-word represent or identify the main 
concepts in the document, herefore if a sentence 
contains everal of them, its score should be high 
so it could be selected as part of the summary. It is 
important to note here that we need a "stop list" for 
each language considered in the summarization 
system. Also, if a Proper Name Recognition mod- 
ule is available for a specific language, we use the 
information about person names, organization 
names, places and dates to contribute in the scores 
of sentences. 
At this point if the lexical resources are avail- 
able, an optional sentence length reduction can be 
carried out using information from a tagging stage. 
This sentence length reduction includes the elimi- 
nation of adjectives from noun phrases, keeping 
only the head noun in a noun phrase, eliminating 
adverbs from verb phrases and eliminating most of 
the prepositional phrases. However, if a word 
selected for elimination is a key word, proper noun, 
the name of a place, a date or a number, the word is 
kept in the sentences. If this word happens to be in 
a prepositional phrase, then the prepositional 
phrase is kept in the sentence. 
Once the scoring process is done, the sentences 
are ranked and a summary is generated using the 
sentences with the higher scores that together do 
175 
not exceed a predetermined percentage of the doc- 
ument's length. This summary is written in the 
document's original language, so a machine trans- 
lation system is used to produce an English version 
of the summary. 
2.6 Output Process 
At this point in the summarization process we 
have a version of the document's ummary in the 
original language and a version in English, both 
encoded using UNICODE and in plain text format. 
The Output Process stage takes these two versions 
of the summary and converts the one written in the 
original language to the original encoding of the 
document (identified by the Language Recognition 
module), then it converts the version in English 
from UNICODE to "8859_1" (ISO Latin-l). 
After the summaries are in the proper output 
encoding, the system generates the summary in one 
of the following formats: SGML, HTML, E-mail 
or Plain text according to the user's specification or 
to system parametrization, for example, if the sum- 
marization system is being used for web delivery, 
then the output format will be HTML by default. 
3 Extending the Summarization 
Capability 
Our goal is to improve the usability and flexi- 
bility of the summarization system, while still 
retaining robustness. This is one of the main rea- 
sons why we favor the sentence selection method 
rather than approaches based on deep analysis and 
generation (Beale 94, Carlson & Nirenburg 90). 
Though much disparaged for lack of readability, 
cohesion etc. systems based in the sentence selec- 
tion method performed well in the recent Tipster 
summarization evaluation. In fact the readability as 
assessed by the evaluators was as high for summa- 
ties of about 30% of the document length as it was 
for the original documents. We are developing 
summarization techniques based on information 
extraction and text generation. These will not give 
very good coverage, because of their domain speci- 
ficity, but do offer advantages, particularly in the 
area of cross document summarization. 
Our experiments have shown for English that 
the inclusion of other language processing tech- 
niques Can indeed increase the flexibility and per- 
formance of the summarizer. In particular proper 
name recognition, co-reference resolution, part of 
speech tagging and partial parsing can all contrib- 
ute to the performance of the system. 
The use of proper names allows the summaries 
to be weighted towards sections of the documents 
discussing specific individuals or organizations 
rather than more general topics. In terms of pro- 
duction of informative summaries, rather than 
indicative summaries, this may be an important 
capability. This technique was used to produce 
summaries evaluated using a "question and 
answer" methodology at the Tipster evaluation and 
produced ahigh performance here. 
We have not incorporated co-reference resolu- 
tion methods in our system yet, but it would seem 
that readability can be improved by the ability to 
replace pronouns with their referents would be use- 
ful. It remains to be seen, however, whether suffi- 
cient accuracy can be achieved to support this 
method. In cases like this where an error may be 
critical for a user of the system we would normally 
mark the fact that the text had been added by the 
system. 
Part of speech tagging and phrase recognition 
allows us to carry out certain kinds of text compac- 
tion. This is particularly important when very short 
summaries (10%) of short documents are required. 
Our experiments with this kind of compaction have 
showed reductions of about 1/3 of the summary 
size with some loss of readability. A single sen- 
tence example shows the usefulness of this tech- 
nique.

Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. was denied a 
permit for a Los Angeles-area dump, threaten- 
ing more than $1 billion in revenue and the 
value of a $100 million investment. 
We hope eventually to have sentence reduction 
in place for all the languages we process, and that 
this will also improve the readability of MT output 
by allowing it to process significantly simplified 
input. 
4 Conclusions 
We feel that further research is warranted on 
improving summarization based on sentence selec- 
tion and that its bad press is largely apocryphal and 
unjustified. In fact from a document analysts point 
of view material from the original document may 
be preferable, carrying as it does, the style and tone 
of the original document. 
We see significant opportunities in carrying out 
further research to develop and integrate language 
processing and other intelligent echniques uch as 
those described above. One particularly challeng- 
ing type of document is the HTML pages found on 
the web. Here techniques to identify coherent sec- 
tions of text are required as well as methods for 
summarizing tables and groups of frames.
