Abstract
Belief tracking is a promising technique for
adding robustness to spoken dialog systems,
but current research is fractured across differ-
ent teams, techniques, and domains. This pa-
per amplifies past informal discussions (Raux,
2011) to call for a belief tracking challenge
task, based on the Spoken dialog challenge
corpus (Black et al., 2011). Benefits, limita-
tions, evaluation design issues, and next steps
are presented.
1 Introduction and background
In dialog systems, belief tracking refers to maintain-
ing a distribution over multiple dialog states as a di-
alog progresses. Belief tracking is desirable because
it provides robustness to errors in speech recogni-
tion, which can be quite common.
This distribution can be modeled in a variety
of ways, including heuristic scores (Higashinaka et
al., 2003), Bayesian networks (Paek and Horvitz,
2000; Williams and Young, 2007), and discrimi-
native models (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006). Tech-
niques have been fielded which scale to realisti-
cally sized dialog problems and operate in real time
(Young et al., 2009; Thomson and Young, 2010;
Williams, 2010; Mehta et al., 2010). In lab settings,
belief tracking has been shown to improve overall
system performance (Young et al., 2009; Thomson
and Young, 2010).
Despite this progress, there are still important un-
resolved issues. For example, a deployment with
real callers (Williams, 2011) found that belief track-
ing sometimes degraded performance due to model
mis-matches that are difficult to anticipate at train-
ing time. What is lacking is a careful comparison
of methods to determine their relative strengths, in
terms of generalization, sample efficiency, speed,
etc.
This position paper argues for a belief tracking
challenge task. A corpus of labeled dialogs and scor-
ing code would be released. Research teams would
enter one or more belief tracking algorithms, which
would be evaluated on a held-out test set.
2 Corpus
The Spoken dialog challenge corpus is an attractive
corpus for this challenge. It consists of phone calls
from real (not simulated) bus riders with real (not
imagined) information needs. There have been 2
rounds of the challenge (2010, and 2011-2012), with
3 systems in each round. The rounds differed in
scope and (probably) user population. A total of 3
different teams entered systems, using different dia-
log designs, speech recognizers, and audio output.
For each system in each round, 500-1500 dialogs
were logged. While it would be ideal if the corpus
included more complex interactions such as negotia-
tions, as a publicly available corpus it is unparalleled
in terms of size, realism, and system diversity.
There are limitations to a challenge based on this
corpus: it would not allow comparisons across do-
mains, nor for multi-modal or situated dialog. These
aspects could be left for a future challenge. An-
other possible objection is that off-line experiments
would not measure end-to-end impact on a real di-
alog system; however, we do know that good be-
lief tracking improves dialog performance (Young
23
et al., 2009; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams,
2011), so characterizing and improving belief track-
ing seems a logical next step. Moreover, building an
end-to-end dialog system is a daunting task, out of
reach of many research teams without specific fund-
ing. A corpus-based challenge has a much lower
barrier to entry.
3 Evaluation issues
There are many (not one!) metrics to evaluate. It
is crucial to design these in advance and implement
them as computer programs for use during develop-
ment. Specific metrics could draw on the follow-
ing core concepts. Baseline accuracy measures the
speech recognition 1-best ? i.e., accuracy without
belief tracking. 1-best accuracy measures how of-
ten the belief tracker?s 1-best hypothesis is correct.
Mean reciprocal rank measures the quality of the
ordering of the belief state, ignoring the probabili-
ties used to order; log-likelihood measures the qual-
ity of the probabilities. ROC curves measure the
1-best discrimination of the belief tracker at differ-
ent false-accept rates, or at the equal error rate.
An important question is at which turns to assess
the accuracy of the belief in a slot. For example, ac-
curacy could be measured at every turn; every turn
after a slot is first mentioned; only turns where a slot
is mentioned; only turns where a slot appears in the
speech recognition result; and so on. Depending on
the evaluation metric, it may be necessary to anno-
tate dialogs for the user?s goal, which could be done
automatically or manually. Another issue is how to
automatically determine whether a belief state value
is correct at the semantic level.
A final question is how to divide the corpus into a
training and test set in a way that measures robust-
ness to the different conditions. Perhaps some of the
data from the second round (which has not yet been
released) could be held back for evaluation.
4 Next steps
The next step is to form a group of interested re-
searchers to work through the issues above, partic-
ularly for the preparation of the corpus and evalu-
ation methodology. Once this is documented and
agreed, code to perform the evaluation can be de-
veloped, and additional labelling (if needed) can be
started.
