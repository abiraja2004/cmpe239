Abstract
The growth of digital clinical data has raised
questions as to how best to leverage this data
to aid the world of healthcare. Promising ap-
plication areas include Information Retrieval
and Question-Answering systems. Such sys-
tems require an in-depth understanding of the
texts that are processed. One aspect of this
understanding is knowing if a medical con-
dition outlined in a patient record is recent,
or if it occurred in the past. As well as this,
patient records often discuss other individu-
als such as family members. This presents
a second problem - determining if a medi-
cal condition is experienced by the patient de-
scribed in the report or some other individ-
ual. In this paper, we investigate the suitabil-
ity of a machine learning (ML) based system
for resolving these tasks on a previously unex-
plored collection of Patient History and Phys-
ical Examination reports. Our results show
that our novel Score-based feature approach
outperforms the standard Linguistic and Con-
textual features described in the related litera-
ture. Specifically, near-perfect performance is
achieved in resolving if a patient experienced
a condition. While for the task of establish-
ing when a patient experienced a condition,
our ML system significantly outperforms the
ConText system (87% versus 69% f-score, re-
spectively).
1 Introduction
The growth of the digitization of clinical docu-
ments has fostered interest in how to best lever-
age this data in providing assistance in the world
of healthcare, including novel information re-
trieval (Voorhees and Tong, 2010), question an-
swering (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Patrick
and Li, 2011) and clinical summarization sys-
tems (Feblowitz et al, 2011).
Given the richness of the language found in clin-
ical reports, novel systems require a deeper under-
standing of this textual data. One aspect of this un-
derstanding is the assertion status of medical condi-
tions (Demner-Fushman et al, 2011). The assertion
status of a medical condition may refer to Negation
Resolution, Temporal Grounding (deciding if a con-
dition is currently or historical, and Condition Attri-
bution (deciding if a condition is experienced by the
patient described in the report or some other individ-
ual). The focus of this paper rests on the latter two
tasks of Temporal Grounding and Condition Attribu-
tion as Negation has been satisfactorily addressed in
Chapman et al (2007).
Several approaches, ranging in complexity, have
been proposed for resolving temporal information.
Hripcsak et al (2005) modeled the task as a con-
straint satisfaction problem. Another rule-based ap-
proach that achieved moderate results uses regular
expressions matching occurrences of trigger terms
(Chapman et al 2007). A trigger term in this context
refers to a term or phrase that provides strong evi-
dence supporting the attribution (e.g., patient, fam-
ily member) or temporality (e.g., current, past) of
a condition. Given the limitations of solely us-
ing pre-composed trigger term lists, recent focus
has been placed on the use of rule-based learning
systems with different feature sets (Mowery et al,
2009). Section headers, tense and aspect are investi-
gated as features, with promising results for the tem-
porality task achieving an accuracy score of 89%.
However, the authors? acknowledge that conclusions
drawn must be tentative as a majority class classifier
achieved an accuracy of 86.9% (only 13% of condi-
tions in the dataset are historical).
38
This paper extends current work in the domain in
the following ways. The dataset used in these exper-
iments is generated from a collection of previously
unannotated History & Physical (H&P) Examina-
tion reports. Prior work has focused on other report
types such as discharge summaries and emergency
department reports. In these cases the distribution
of historical and recent conditions is often heavily
skewed in favour of descriptions of recent conditions
experienced by the patient. As H&P reports aim to
provide a comprehensive picture of a patient?s past
and present state, a more uniform distribution of his-
torical and recent conditions is present in this report
type. This work extends previous work by exploring
the use of machine learning (ML) as an alternative to
hand-crafted rule based systems and rule-based ML
approaches to resolving these tasks.
In this work, a comparative analysis of several
ML algorithms from different paradigms are eval-
uated, in order to determine the best approach for
our tasks. Building on this, the performance of four
automatically extracted feature sets are evaluated,
identifying their contributions and also their interac-
tions. This work also extends existing work by au-
tomatically extracting features that were previously
extracted manually as well as the proposal of a set
of novel score-based features. The performance of
the ML algorithms are compared to the rule-based
system - ConText. Our results show that the ML
approaches significantly outperform this rule-based
system on the Temporal Grounding task.
2 Related Work
Natural Language Processing techniques have
been shown to have many different uses in Clinical
Text Analysis, such as in the representation (Sager
et al, 1994) and understanding (Christensen, 2002)
of clinical narratives, and frequently now in the con-
text of more elaborate large-scale systems, such as a
clinical decision support system (Demner-Fushman
et al, 2009).
Given the sensitive nature of clinical narratives
and the difficulty in obtaining data collections for
experimental purposes, evaluation and comparison
of NLP systems in this domain is difficult. However,
recently anonymised data provided by the Biomedi-
cal Language Understanding (BLU) Lab at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh as well as datasets provided
as part of the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge (Uzuner et
al., 2011), has greatly aided NLP research into the
processing of clinical narratives. The dataset pro-
vided by BLU Lab and used in this work con-
sists of 101,711 reports of several different report
types ranging from discharge summaries to surgical
pathology reports. The report types differ in con-
tent, technical language and structure. For example,
surgical pathology reports are very technical and ex-
plicit in the information that they convey, e.g. results
of a biopsy, blood cell counts etc. In contrast, dis-
charge summaries and consultation reports are more
expressive, and aim to create a more complete pa-
tient profile, e.g. including work and personal cir-
cumstances. The BLU Lab have published a num-
ber of papers on the topic of resolving the assertion
status of medical conditions (Chapman et al, 2007;
Harkema et al, 2009; Mowery et al, 2009). Their
ConText algorithm (Chapman et al, 2007) uses
handcrafted regular expressions, along with trigger
terms and termination terms to determine character-
istics of a condition mention in a text. The condition
characteristics investigated included negation, tem-
porality (recent, historical, hypothetical) and experi-
encer (patient, other). Their approach worked very
well on the negation and hypothetical temporality,
achieving an f-score of 97% in determining nega-
tion and an f-score of 88% in resolving hypothetical
conditions. However, the approach was less success-
ful when determining historical conditions and their
experiencer, with f-scores of 71% and 67%, respec-
tively. These results were generated on emergency
room reports only.
In more recent work, their algorithm was ap-
plied to 5 other types of clinical document, namely:
surgical pathology, operative procedure, radiol-
ogy, echocardiogram and discharge summaries
(Harkema et al, 2009). Results achieved on these
new datasets were largely the same, with f-scores
for negation ranging between 75% and 95%, and for
hypothetical conditions ranging between 76% and
96%. Again, a marked drop-off was seen for histor-
ical conditions, with few occurrences of conditions
for other experiencers annotated in the datasets (i.e.
relatives) making it difficult to draw definitive con-
clusions from this work.
Although this manual rule based approach has
performed well and is advocated due to its ease of
implementation (Meystre et al, 2008), Harkema et
al. (2009) note its limitations in resolving historical
conditions, and encourage the possibility of statisti-
cal classifiers in which information other than lexi-
cal items, are considered as features. Further work
investigating the use of Machine Learning (Uzuner
et al, 2009; Mowery et al, 2009) has seen posi-
39
tive breakthroughs in resolving the assertion status
of medical conditions.
The 2010 i2b2 challenge (Uzuner et al, 2011)
provided a rigid and standardized platform for eval-
uating systems in resolving the assertion status of
medical conditions found in Discharge Summaries.
The challenge consisted of three subtasks:Concept
Extraction, Assertion and Relation Identification.
The second subtask of Assertion involved the devel-
opment of systems that resolved the assertion sta-
tus of medical conditions. As part of the asser-
tion task there were six possible assertion statuses:
present, absent, uncertain, conditional, or not associ-
ated with the patient. Systems submitted to this chal-
lenge ranged from more simplistic pattern matching
techniques to more complex supervised and semi-
supervised approaches (de Bruijn et al, 2011; Clark
et al, 2011). The datasets used in the 2010 i2b2
challenge were not available to non-participants at
the time the experiments presented in this work were
conducted. We plan to explore these datasets in
future work. This research investigates patient vs.
non-patient conditions as well as past vs. present
conditions in order to fine tune feature-sets that may
be generalized to further assertion statuses.
In the context of this paper, while the BLU Lab
clinical report collection is available, the medical
condition annotations are not. As already stated, our
intention is to explore a machine learning approach
to these tasks. For this purpose we annotated a por-
tion of the consultation report section of the collec-
tion. There were two reasons for this - firstly, the
BLU Lab have not reported results on this report
type so there is no duplication of annotation effort
and secondly, it turns out that the consultation re-
ports are a much richer source of historical condi-
tions and condition attribution than any of the report
types annotated previously.
3 Method
3.1 Corpus
For this task, 120 H&P reports were randomly
extracted from the BluLab?s NLP repository. As
already stated, this report type?s fuller descriptions
make it richer than previous datasets in instances
of condition attribution and temporal grounding. A
breakdown in the distributions of these annotations
can be seen in Tables 1 and 2.
H&P reports may vary in the organization of con-
tent, but the content is mostly uniform, expressing
the same information about patients (Sager et al,
1987). As well as this, many reports feature head-
ings for different sections of the report (past medical
history, impression), information which can be used
as features in a classification task. Before annotat-
ing conditions found in the text, preprocessing was
required in order to retain such information.

3.1.1 Preprocessing
Preprocessing of the data consisted of a simple
Java program that extended Lingpipe1 tools in or-
der to correctly split sentences on this dataset, and
extract the heading for the section in which the sen-
tence is contained.
The preprocessing outputs the sentence number,
followed by a separator, the sentence?s contents and
the heading under which the sentence features. Sen-
tences were split for ease of annotation and also
to allow parsing and part-of-speech tagging by the
C&C2 parsing tools. C&C was chosen for its scala-
bilty, speed and the accuracy of its biomedical lan-
guage models. A cursory analysis of its output in-
dicates that its performance is acceptable. As C&C
does not provide a sentence splitter, Lingpipe?s split-
ter was availed of for this task.
3.1.2 Annotation
Annotation of the dataset was performed by two
annotators over a 60 hour period. The inter-
annotator agreement was measured using the kappa
statistic (Carletta, 1996). A kappa statistic of 0.78
was achieved. The annotators were presented with
the collection, to annotate with an XML like tag
?CONDITION?. This tag must have two attributes,
?EXP? representing condition attribution and ?HIST?
1http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/

representing the temporal grounding of the condi-
tion.
? HIST: A value of 1 indicates the occurrence of a
historical condition, where 0 describes a current
or recent condition. e.g. ?The patient presented
with <CONDITION NUM=?1? HIST=?0?> re-
nal failure </CONDITION>? would indicate the
condition ?renal failure? is current.
? EXP: A value of 1 implies the expe-
riencer is the patient with 0 signifying
?other?. e.g. ?The patient has a fam-
ily history of <CONDITION NUM=?1?
EXP=?0?>hypertension </CONDITION>?
signifies the condition ?hypertension? is not
experienced by the patient.
3.2 Machine Learning Algorithms
Early work in the resolution of assertion status
primarily focused on the use of manually created
rule-based systems, with more recent work focusing
on statistical and ML methods. However, the do-
main of ML contains many sub-paradigms and vary-
ing approaches to classification. In this paper, three
ML methods that have not been previously applied
to this task are explored. These three classifiers,
namely Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Ran-
dom Forest represent the paradigms of probabilistic,
lazy and ensemble learning, respectively.
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier imple-
menting Bayes Theorem. As a result, features im-
plemented using this classifier are deemed to be in-
dependent. Despite this strong assumption it has
been shown to be more than successful in text classi-
fication tasks such as spam filtering (Provost, 1999).
k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) (Cover and Hart,
1967) is a simple pattern recognition algorithm that
classifies an instance according to its distance to the
k closest training instances. This algorithm has been
chosen to represent the paradigm of lazy learning,
i.e. there is no training phase as all computation
is performed at the classification stage. Despite its
simplicity, k-NN has often produce high accuracy
results in comparison to other approaches (Caruana,
2006).
The final classifier chosen for this task represents
the state-of-the-art in machine learning, namely the
Random Forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001). A Ran-
dom Forest consists of many different decision trees,
combining bagging (Breiman, 1996), and random
feature selection.
3.3 Features
In this section, a list of features contributing to
this task are presented. All features are automati-
cally extracted using a set of tools developed by the
authors. Section 3.3.1 presents score-based features
that are unique to this work. Section 3.3.2 describes
the implementation of features outlined in Chapman
et al(2007). Section 3.3.3 and Section 3.3.4 present
features similar to those investigated in Mowery et
al. (2009).
3.3.1 Score based features
Scored based features used in this system extend
and reinforce Trigger List features by computing a
normalized score for the number of occurrences of
Trigger List terms3. This feature aims to add fur-
ther granularity to the decision making of the ML al-
gorithms, presenting a floating point number rather
than a binary one.
The equation for computing these scores is de-
fined as follows.
s =
Nt
(Nw ? Sw)
(1)
Nt represents the number of trigger terms found in
the sentence that contains the condition, Nw is the
total number of words in the sentence, with Sw being
the number of stopwords4. These scores are calcu-
lated for each type of trigger term. For example, for
trigger type relative mention, a score is calculated
using mentions of relatives in the sentence.
3.3.2 Trigger List Features
? precededByHistTerm: This feature performs
a look-up for trigger terms from the historical
word list, checking if it directly precedes the
condition. An example historical trigger term
would be ?history of? as in ?a history of dia-
betes?. If a condition, such as diabetes, is mod-
ified by a historical trigger term, it will return 1,
otherwise 0.
? containsHistMention: This is a weaker
form of precededByHistTerm, checking sim-
ply if a trigger term from the historical list oc-
curs in the same sentence as the condition. If
one does, it will return 1 otherwise 0.
? hasRelativeMention: If the sentence which
contains the condition also contains a trigger

stopwords.txt
41
term from the experiencer list such as ?mother?,
?father? or ?uncle? it will return 1, otherwise 0.
? hasPatientMention: 1 if the sentence men-
tions the patient, otherwise 0.
? containsDeath: 1 if it contains the terms ?de-
ceased?, ?died? from the death trigger terms list
otherwise 0. A sentence describing death is more
likely to refer to a relative, rather than the pa-
tient.
? mentionsCommunity: 1 if one of ?area?,
?community? from the geographical trigger list
is mentioned, otherwise 0. If a sentence de-
scribes a community, as in ?there has been a re-
cent outbreak of flu in the area?, it is not refer-
ring to the patient, therefore the condition should
not be attributed to the patient.
? precededByWith: 1 if the condition is directly
preceded by ?with?, otherwise 0. ?with? was
found to have higher frequency when describ-
ing patients rather than individuals other than the
patient. e.g. ?Patient presented with high blood
pressure and fever.?
? containsPseudoTerms: Pseudo-historical
terms or phrases may mention a term that is
found in the Historical list, but do not indicate
that a condition mention in the same sentence is
being used in a historical context. For example,
?poor history? is a pseudo-historical trigger
term. It uses a historical trigger term (?history?);
however ?poor history? refers to the incomplete
nature of the patient?s medical history, not the
historical nature of their condition. This feature
returns 1 on the occurrence of a pseudo trigger
term, otherwise 0.
3.3.3 Contextual features
In resolving the textual context of conditions, it
is important to look at what surrounds the condition
beyond the lexical items. With these contextual fea-
tures, we can capture that section in which a sen-
tence occurs, and how many conditions occur in the
sentence.
? isInFamHist: The importance of header infor-
mation is motivated by the assumption that con-
ditions that fall under explicit headings, are more
than likely to have a greater affinity to the head-
ing. This feature returns 1 if it is under Family
History, 0 otherwise.
? isInList: A binary feature denoting whether
a condition occurs as part of a list of conditions,
with one condition per line. Returns 1 if it is a
member of such a list, otherwise 0.
? numOfConditions: This feature represents the
number of conditions present in a given sen-
tence. A higher number of conditions indicates
that the condition may be part of a list. Sentences
that contain a list of conditions tend to list past
conditions rather than recently suffered illnesses.
3.3.4 Linguistically motivated features
Three features were designed to monitor the ef-
fect of the verb tense on a condition. This feature
has already been shown to aid the classification pro-
cess (Mowery et al, 2009). For this task, linguistic
features were extracted from the output of the C&C
parsing tool, using both part-of-speech tags along
with dependency information.
? hasPastTense: A binary feature with 1 indi-
cating the sentence contains a past tense verb, 0
otherwise. e.g. ?The patient previously suffered
renal failure? would return 1. If a condition is
modified by a past tense verb, it has occurred in
the past.
? hasPresentTense: A binary feature with 1
indicating the sentence contains a present tense
verb, 0 otherwise. If a condition is modified by a
present tense verb, the condition is current. e.g.
?the patient presents coughing?.
? containsModalVerb: A binary feature with 1
indicating the sentence contains a modal verb,
0 otherwise. e.g. ?palpitations may have been
caused by anxiety?. The presence of the modal
?may? following the condition indicates the con-
dition is currently being examined and is there-
fore recent.
? tenseInClause: Analyzes the tense found in
the same syntactic clause as the condition being
examined. For example, in ?abdominal pain has
ceased, but patient now complains of lower ex-
tremity pain?, ?abdominal pain? has a past tense
within its clausal boundary, where the clause
which contains ?lower extremity pain? has a
present tense verb.
? tenseChange: Determines whether the verb
tense used in the clause that contains the con-
dition differs with the verb in another clause in
the sentence. e.g. ?Migraines persist yet palpi-
tations resolved?. This feature allows finer gran-
ularity in resolving the tense surrounding condi-
tions, such as the description of current condi-
tions in the context of the patient?s history.

4 Experiment Setup & Evaluation
There are two aims of the experiments reported
in this section: firstly, to evaluate the performance
of ML algorithms in resolving the assertion status of
medical conditions. Secondly, to assess the perfor-
mance of individual feature sets in order to discover
the most contributory and informatory features or
sets of features. To evaluate the latter, classifications
using all possible combinations of feature sets (listed
in Table 3) were performed.

4.1 Evaluation
The systems are evaluated by the metrics preci-
sion, recall and f-score:
precision =
TP
TP + FP
recall =
TP
TP + FN
f =
2? Precision?Recall
Precision + Recall
where TP is the number of true positives, FP is the num-
ber of false positives, FN is the number of false negatives.
Systems are evaluated using both cross-validation
and hold-out methods. In the hold-out method there
are two data sets, one used for training the classifier
and a second for testing it on a blind sub-set of test
material. 10-fold cross-validation is performed on
the training sets and final results are reported in this
paper on the held-out blind test set. Three hold-out
classification splits were experimented with (i.e.,
train/test splits: 30%/70%; 50%/50%; 70%/30%).
We found that results for each of the data splits and
cross-validation experiments were largely uniform.
To avoid repetition of results, Section 5 focuses on
experiments using a held-out method training/test
split of 70%/30%. All hold-out experiments were
implemented using Weka?s (Hall et al, 2009) Ex-
perimenter interface. Cross-Validation experiments
were performed using a script developed by the au-
thors in conjunction with Weka?s API. This allowed
the ML approaches and the ConText algorithm to be
evaluated against the same test-folds.
4.1.1 Comparison with a rule-based system
ConText (Chapman et al, 2007) is a simple yet
effective rule-based system designed to resolve the
assertion status of medical conditions. Comparative
analysis is performed between an implementation of
ConText5 and the ML approaches described in 3.2.
The ML systems were trained on 70% of the dataset
(610 conditions). The remaining 30% (262 condi-
tions) was used as a test set for both ConText and
the Machine Learning systems. For cross-validation
experiments, ConText was evaluated against each
test set fold. For the Condition Attribution exper-
iments training was performed on 675 conditions
with testing performed on 290 conditions. In eval-
uating Temporal Grounding the training set com-
prised of 610 conditions with the test-set containing
262 conditions.
5 Experimental Results
This section reports results of the experiments
outlined in Section 4.
5.1 Condition Attribution
In a system that resolves the assertion status of
medical conditions, it is of benefit to know who is
experiencing the medical condition before resolving
more complex information such as temporality. In
this section, preliminary results on Condition Attri-
bution are presented. The dataset used in evaluat-
ing the effectiveness of Condition Attribution was
highly skewed, as shown in Table 1. This is a natural
skew caused simply by the fact that reports discuss
the patient more than other individuals (e.g., blood
relatives). As a result the baseline score using a Ma-
jority Class classifier achieved an f-score of 95%
(Table 4). Given these results, the contextual fea-
ture set contributes most, as shown by the removal
of the contextual feature set in TrigLingScore coin-
ciding with a drop in performance. However, the
skewed dataset resulted in no statistical significance

between classifiers and feature-sets.

Validation for the Condition Attribution task

TrigConScore 100% 100% 100% 95%
Con 100% 100% 100% 95%
In this task, ConText achieved an f-score of 99%.
As there is little difference in scores achieved be-
tween ConText and the approaches in Table 4 - a
manual rule-based system can be considered ade-
quate for this task.
Taking a closer look at the performance of the fea-
ture sets, we see that the contextual feature set con-
tributes most to the task with the removal of contex-
tual features coinciding with a drop in performance
e.g., TrigLingScore in Table 4. The strength of this
feature set lies with the feature isInFamHist. This
feature simply checks if the condition occurs under
the heading ?Family History?. Its highly influen-
tial performance would indicate that its quite rare
for the mention of another individual anywhere else
in a clinical report. The Con run, which is solely
composed of contextual features achieves near per-
fect performance, an indication that the contribution
of other features to the task of Condition Attribu-
tion is minimal. Although this work used only H&P
reports, this finding may be generalized to other re-
port types such as Discharge Summaries which also
explicitly mark sections pertaining to other individ-
uals.
5.2 Temporal Grounding
The distribution of past and recent medical con-
ditions is not skewed (as in the Condition Attribu-
tion task), and hence it presents a more challeng-
ing classification task. Despite the varying per-
formance of individual classifiers and feature sets
the results obtained are again largely similar across
cross-validation and hold-out methods, with the per-
formance of each training set fitting the distribu-
tion in Figure 1. Initial experiments investigated the
use of another state-of-the-art classifier, the Support
Vector Machine using a polykernel, however due to
its relatively poor performance (70% f-score, with
its precision soundly beaten by other approaches) it
will not be discussed in further detail.
Random Forest proved to be the most effective
classifier across almost all feature sets. However,
kNN was a very near second place - Random Forest
only significantly6 outperformed kNN on two occa-
sions (TrigLingConScore, LingConScore). In con-
strast, Naive Bayes performed poorly - despite hav-
ing outperformed all other systems on the precision
metric, it failed to outperform the baseline majority
classifier on the recall.
Although the precision of ConText matches that
of the Random Forest and kNN (Table 5), it is also
let down by its recall performance. As a result, there
is a statistical significant difference between its f-
score and that of the Random Forest and kNN.

kNN 80% 80% 80%
RandomForest 82% 84% 83%
NaiveBayes 91% 61% 72%

Majority 55% 100% 71%
6 Discussion
The distribution of recent and historical condi-
tions for the task of Temporal Grounding is more
evenly distributed than that used in Condition Attri-
bution, allowing for a more interesting comparison
of the approaches and features employed.
Figure 1 shows the performance of each ML for
each feature-set combination. Random Forest was
expectedly the best performing algorithm. However,
more surprising was the comparative performance
of the often overlooked kNN algorithm. Both ap-
proaches statistically significantly outperformed the
rule-based system ConText. Though the rule based
system matched the high performing ML systems in
terms of precision, it was significantly outperformed
with respect to recall.
The most contributory feature set in the ML runs
was the novel score-based feature set. This feature
creates a normalized score for the occurrence of trig-
ger terms in the same sentence as the medical con-
dition in question. It was designed to reinforce the
importance of trigger terms, by providing a numeric
score to support the binary Trigger List feature. The
addition of score-based features to any of the fea-

Figure 1: Temporal Grounding f-score performance with 70% Training Data
Grounding is minimal, or even detrimental to the
task. For example, in Figure 1, the performance
of the kNN algorithm increases from TrigLingCon-
Score to TrigLingScore with the removal of contex-
tual features. The performance of the Random For-
est is unaffected by such detrimental features as it
performs its own feature selection prior to classifi-
cation. Though there are several feature set com-
binations reaching a high level of performance, the
most effective approach combines trigger list terms,
linguistic and score based features with the Random
Forest algorithm.
These experiments extend previous work by pro-
viding a systematic, automated approach to feature
extraction for the purpose of ML approaches to Tem-
poral Grounding. They also indicate the high per-
formance and contribution of our novel score-based
features. These features are not designed to solely
classify instances found in H&P reports and can
be applied to other clinical reports such as Dis-
charge Summaries and Emergency Department re-
ports. Previous work has involved the use of the
latter mentioned report types. Unfortunately, given
the terms-of-use of these datasets they could not be
made available to authors to facilitate comparative
experiments.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the use of machine
learning (ML) in resolving if and when a patient
experienced a medical condition. The implemented
ML algorithms made use of features comprising of
trigger terms, linguistic and contextual information,
and novel score-based features. In an evaluation of
these feature sets it was found that score-based fea-
tures contributed to the task of resolving when a pa-
tient experienced a medical condition.
The ML approaches were also evaluated against
the rule-based system ConText on a new annotated
dataset of History & Physical (H&P) Examination
Reports. In this evaluation it was discovered that the
task of resolving if a condition was experienced by
the patient was adequately solved by the ConText
system, achieving an f-score of 99%. Although, the
ML approaches proposed achieved perfect perfor-
mance, there is no statistical significance between
the result sets. However, the more challenging task
of deciding when a patient experienced a medical
condition is deemed to be best suited to a ML ap-
proach, with the top performing classifier Random
Forest achieving an f-score of 87%, significantly
outperforming ConText which achieved 69% on the
same dataset .
The results achieved in these tasks have paved the
way for several avenues of future work. We be-
lieve that the performance of these tasks is now suffi-
ciently accurate to justify their inclusion in an Infor-
mation Retrieval (IR) application. It is our intention
to use our medical condition analysis techniques to
annotate clinical documents and build an advanced
IR system capable of taking advantage of this mark
up in the context of the TREC Medical Records
Track 20127. With the availability of datasets such
as that of the i2b2 Shared Task 2010 data, further
work will include experimentation on these datasets
as well as an investigation into further assertion sta-
tuses.
