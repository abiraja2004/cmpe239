1. Introduction 
hi recent years many researchers working in the 
field of NLP have turned to large text resources 
such its machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) 
and text corpora, in order to cope with the major 
problem of building a large computational 
lexicon. Within the Esprit project "Acquilex ''1 
the possibility of exploiting existing mono- and 
bi-lingual MRDs of four languages 2. in order to 
develop amulti-lingual nd maximally reusable 
(by different researchers, for different NLP 
tasks) lexical knowledge base (LKB) is being 
explored m~d, indeed, we are finding evidence 
that important semantic and syntactic information 
can be semi-automatically extracted from these 
sources with significant saving in resources, 
comp,'u-ed to building a lexicon by hand. 
The task of extracting lexical information 
from MRDs is a non-trivial one iu that such 
information is mostly implicit in dictionaries 
and completely new techniques and 
methodologies have to be developed in order to 
achieve this goal. Furthermore, it is necessary 
both to take into account the peculiar 
characteristics of dictionary structures and to 
make theoretical hypotheses about the kind of 
information which can be useful for NLP 
systems and which therefore should be 
extracted. Indeed, these are two of the major 
issues being dealt with within Acquilex (another 
one being the issue regarding the representation 
of the knowledge extracted). Therefore, our 
work has been guided by theoretical hypotheses 
and empirical observations at the same time. 
First of all we assumed the centrality of the 
lexicon in the organization of natural languages; 
then, on the basis of the growing interest of 
different heoretical frameworks for semantic 
phenomena and of the fact that contemporary 
syntactic theories seem to converge on the 
hypothesis that syntactic structure is, to a large 
extent, determined by word meaning, we tried to 
see if it was possible to identify, within our 
dictionaries, that kind of semantic information 
on verbs which had been described as 
determining fundamental syntactic behaviours of 
the verbs themselves (cf. Levin 1985; Levin & 
Rappaport 1991). Finally, we tried to follow 
some indications, provided in works such as 
those of Pustejovsky (1989) or Boguraev & 
Pustejovsky (1990), relative to the kinds of 
lexical data which should be sought within 
MRDs and other computerized sources in order 
to be able to deal with problems facing the 
computational lingnist aiming at building 
components for NLP. According to Boguraev & 
Pustejovsky (1990: 39), i.e., tile following 
information should be individuated within 
sources of lexical data such as MRDs: argument 
structure; event structure (Aktionsart); qualia 
structure (Pnstejovsky (1989)); lexical 
inheritauce structure. 
Dictionary definitions are generally structured 
so that it is possible to identify two fundamental 
parts within them: the "genus term", which is 
connected with the entry-word by means of an 
IS-A (or taxonomical) relation, and the 
"differentia" part, in which what differenliates 
the entry from its hypernym is indicated 3
Within Acquilcx we are improving and 
developing techniques aimed at exploiting both 
the taxonomical organization of information in 
dictionaries and the fact that recurrent structures 
and patterns are found in the differentia; such 
patterns are being individuated through apattern-- 
matching procedure (which operates on the 
output of the syntactic analysis of definitions) in 
order to associate them with corresponding 
relations or semantic / conceptual categories (for 
descriptions of methodologies for extracting 
taxonomies fiom MRDs, see Calzolari (1984) 
aud Chodorow, Byrd & fleidorn (1985). For 
discussion of this way of analysing the 
differentia, see Calzolari (1991)). In the 
following, a research being carried out within 
this project and aimed at developing techniques 
for extracting different kinds of information 
related to motion verbs is presented. 
2. In format ion on motion verbs within 
dict ionar ies 
Motion verbs have been the subject of several 
studies by linguists because they present 
particularly interesting semantic and syntactic 
characteristics. In particular, even if they are 
often considered as being a coherent semantic 
class (and indeed we speak of "motion verbs" as 
a whole), we can find verbs displaying 
different semantic features and syntactic 
behaviour in this class. With our research, 
ACRES DE COLING-92. NANTES, 23..28 AOL"r 1992 1 3 1 5 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANrES. AUG. 23-28, 1992 
therefore, we have tried to individuate 
information on this class of verbs to be used to 
further classify them according to semantic 
characteristics which subsets of them present 
and which are connected with different syntactic 
behaviours. 
By analysing our mono-l ingual Italian 
dictionaries and the Collins bi-lingual, it is 
possible to extract the following kinds of 
syntactic and semantic information on motion 
verbs, by means of semi-automatic procedures: 
1) transitivity/ intransitivity/reflexivity4; 
2) Aktionsart (or "lexical aspect"); 
3) unaccusativity or unergativity (for 
intransitive verbs); 
4) components of meaning, typical subjects, 
thematic roles. 
While the information in the first point is 
explicitly coded within our dictionaries, a 
procedure was developed in order to extract 
information on Aktionsart (i.e., to classify 
verbs in a Vendlerian fashion (Vendler (1967))) 
which exploits the taxonomical organization of 
data in dictionaries and the possibility of having 
inheritance of information as a consequence of
the IS-A link. After classifying "genus term" 
verbs, we make each hyponym inherit the 
Aktionsart-class from its superordinate verb 
unless some specific patterns, recognized 
through a pattern-matching procedure, are found 
in the differentia part of its definition. If this is 
the case, the entry-verb considered is classified 
in a different way, according to specific rules 
stated in advance (see Alonge (1991)). 
Information on unaccusativity or unergativity of
intransitive motion verbs (in Perlmutter's (1978) 
sense) is easily extracted for Italian by taking 
into consideration the auxiliary selected by a 
verb (unaccusatives take essere (to be)), which 
is indicated in the Collins bi-lingual. 
Finally, by analyzing the differentia part of 
definitions, we find information on components 
of meaning of verbs, typical subjects and also 
thematic roles. Components of meaning and 
typical subjects are individuated by identifying 
recurrent patterns, clearly referring to specific 
semantic ategories, within the differentia. For 
the time being, a detailed analysis has been 
carried out in relation to the verbs within the 
taxonomy of muoversi (intransitive tomove) in 
GRZ (244 entries); we first examined manually 
some of the definitions of verbs within the 
taxonomy and individuated recurrent patterns 
connected with components of meaning which 
were, therefore, considered potentially relevant 
to describe the semantics of the whole class of 
verbs, even if not every pattern was found in 
each definition. The following are examples of 
the patterns found within the definitions 
analysed and of the components of meaning 
which were connected with them: 
? MANNER of MOTION: ~on / come / a 
NP; AdvP; V-ing 
? GOAL: a / incontro a / v~rs9 NP; AdvP 
? SOURCE: 
. PATH: da .,. a / da ... verso NP 
? MEDIUM: per via di / in / ~.NP 
? PURPOSE: ~ VP 
? TYPICAL SUBJECT: d~tto di / si ~ti~:g 
?_LL_,0LY_P 
A pattern-matching procedure is now being 
implemented which identifies patterns within the 
differentia and relates them to semantic 
categories (or typical subjects). Furthermore, 
each verb inherits the components of meaning 
connected with its superordinate verb(sp.  
Agitarsi (to toss) is defined (in GRZ, sense 1) 
as "muoversi con vivacit~t, con irrequietezza, con 
violenza" ("to move vivaciously, restlessly, 
violently"); the genus term muoversi simply 
refers to "the fact of motion" and is not 
connected with any other particular components 
of meaning; the PPs which we find in the 
differentia, instead, refer to MANNER of 
MOTION, so that our procedure will analyse 
agitarsi as connected with a MANNER of 
MOTION component of meaning. Fuggire (to 
escape), then, is defined (GRZ, 1) as 
"allontanarsi d corsa, per lo pih per evitare un 
pericolo o un danno" ("to go away at a run, 
mostly to avoid a danger or a damage"): since 
the genus term allontanarsi is related to a GOAL 
component of meaning, fuggire itself will be 
connected with the same component of meaning 
plus a MANNER of MOTION component (di 
and a PURPOSE component 
v_e~,am~..). 
Sometimes different semantic ategories may be 
indicated by the same lexical category / pattern, 
so that it was necessary to define lists of 
specific (sequences of) words to be connected 
with one of the components of meaning in 
order to distinguish instances of it from 
instances of the other component related to the 
same pattern. For instance, the same preposition 
can be used in Italian to express different 
meaning categories. This is the case of the 
preposition a (at, in, to...): when coupled with 
most nouns (/noun phrases) it indicates GOAL 
(with motion verbs); however, when it is used 
in conjunction with certain nouns, idiomatic 
expressions are formed which refer to 
MANNER of MOTION. Therefore, in order to 
recognize the latter cases, we identified a limited 
list of such idiomatic expressions (which can be 
found with motion verbs) so that when one of 
these xpressions i  found within a definition the 
verb defined will have a MANNER of MOTION 
component of meaning, otherwise, it will have a 
GOAL component 6. Andare (to go), e. g., is 
found together with "a cavallo" (riding) within 
the definition of cavalcare (GRZ, 1) (to ride) 
ACTES DE COLING-92, NAN'IT.S, 23-28 AOUT 1992 1 3 l 6 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, An(;. 23-28, 1992 
and it is also found with "a letto" (to bed) within 
tbe definition of coricarsi (GRZ, 1) (to go to 
bed). In the first definition the idiomatic 
expression "a cavallo" indicates MANNER of 
MOTION, while in the second definitiou we 
have the indication of a GOAL; therefore, 
cavalcare will be connected with a MANNER of 
MOTION component, while coricarsi will refer 
to motion towards a GOAL. Similar procedures 
are being applied to other cases of ambiguities 
and it seems possible to claim that, even if it is 
necessary to do some work by hand, the 
utilization of MRDs and of such semi-automatic 
methodologies of analysis represents a 
significant saving both in time and resources. 
The same information on components of 
meaning was also ntilized to identify thematic 
proto-roles, according to Dowty's (1988) 
proposal, whicll has been adopted within 
Acqui lex (Sanf i l ippo (1991)). Dowry 
individuated two sets of properties which 
contribute to the definition of "prototypical" 
agent and patient role and which are entailed by 
verb meaning: 
? CONTRIBUTING PROPERTIES FOR TIlE 
PROTO-AGENT ROLE: 
volition, sentience (and / or perception) canses 
event, movement 
? CONTRIBUTING PROPERTIES FOR THE 
PROTO-PATIENT ROLE: 
change of state, incremental theme, causally 
affected by event, stationary. 
The argument mving the highest nmnber of 
proto-agent properties entailed by the meaning of 
the verb, and inherited by default, is to be 
associated with the proto-agent role; tim 
argument of a transitive verb to which the 
highest number of proto-patient properties can 
be ascribed (inherently via entaihnent relations, 
and by default), instead, is to be associated with 
the proto-patient role (cf. Sanfilippo (1991)). 
Thus, since fundamental questions about the 
identification, individuation, and even the 
theoretical status of "traditional" thematic roles 
remain unresolved, we decided to detemfine the 
semantic ontent of these basic roles by taking 
into account proPerties which are needed for 
verb classification and which can be identified 
through the analysis of definitions described 
above. 
By examining the verbs within the taxonomy of 
muoversi, we saw that even if they can be either 
strict intransitives, or strict transitives, or 
intransitives taking an oblique object, they all 
imply a subject argument (a proto-agent) which 
corresponds to the "moving object" and for 
which either the manner of motion or the 
direction (and therefore, a change of position) 
can be inherently specified. The information that 
it is the subject of these verbs which is moving 
is inherited from the genus term muoversi; the 
specification relative to the nmnner of motion or 
the change of position is found within the 
differentia of definitions and used to encode 
more information in relation to the "moving 
object" itself. I.e., if we take into consideration 
the definitions of the verbs andare (to go) and 
oscillare (to swing) given below, we may see 
that in relation to the former verb the proto-agent 
moves along a path, while in relation to the latter 
the manner of motion of the proto-agent is 
inherently specified: 
? andare : muoversi da un luogo verso un altro 
(GRZ, 1) (to move from one place to another) 
? oscillare : muoversi alternamente in qua e in l~t 
o in sue  in gift (GRZ, 1) (to move alternately 
bern and there or up and down) 
3. Data f rom d ict ionar ies  and theoret ical  
works  
The data wc have extracted from dictionaries 
were indicated as necessary for a computational 
lexicon within theoretical works (cf. above). 
Furthermore, the data related to components of
meaning can be compared to the results of 
theoretical works in which connections among 
semantic and syntactic haracteristics of motion 
verbs were identified, in order both to verify the 
validity of hypothesis put forward on the basis 
of observation of limited data and to derive 
information on syntactic behaviours of large 
amonnts of verbs. 
Tahny (1985) deeply investigated the 
relationships among surface expressions related 
to tnotion verbs and their semantics across 
languages, lie individuated ifferent ways of 
"conflating" components of meaning across 
languages which relate to the different syntactic 
configurations allowed. The ability to refer to 
these lexicalization patterns, ome of which are 
Ulfiversal across languages while some vary 
systematically defining typologies of languages, 
can help structure a nmlti-lingual LKB of the 
sort we are building. Actually, in dictionary 
definitions we find usefid information i  relation 
to the kind of "conflation" of components of 
meaning which are allowed in Italian and it is 
possible to compare our data with Talmy's 
analyses. While English (but also Chinese, etc.) 
can express at once the "fact of Motion" and its 
manner, (post-Latin) Romance languages 
cannot, according to Talmy. However in Italian 
many verbs express at once "the fact of 
MOTION" and MANNER; what they do not 
often express is what Talmy (1985: 141) calls 
"transhttional motion", i.e. change of position, 
and MANNER together 7. For most verbs in 
Italian what is relevant is either the manner of 
motion, like, e.g., for camminare (to walk) or 
the change of position, like, e.g., for coricarsi 
(to go to bed). Actu',dly, in dictionary definitions 
ACRES DE COLING-92, NANIT..S. 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 13 1 7 I'ROC. Ol: COI.ING-92, NANrES, AOO. 23-28, 1992 
we find information on this kind of "conflation" 
of components of meaning: 
? camminare : andare ~ (GRZ, 1) 
(the pattern underlined refers to MANNER of 
MOTION); 
? coricarsi: andare aletto (GRZ, 1) 
(the pattern underlined indicates GOAL). 
Nevertheless, in Italian there are some manner of 
motion verbs which behave somewhat 
differently. They are manner of motion verbs 
which are both unergative and unaccusative. 
Correre (to run) has both an unergative and an 
unaccusative use; when it used in the 
unaccusative form it refers both to MANNER of 
MOTION and GOAL, as can be seen in the 
examples below: 
? Giovanni ha corso per tre o re /~ 
- Giovanni ~ torso 
Both sentences can indeed be translated as 
"Giovanni ran", but only with the unaccusative 
form (with the auxiliary essere) ,  the goal 
expression "a casa" is allowed. Information on 
this characteric of correre can be found within 
DMI, where ven if correre is defined as "andare 
velocemente" ("to go fast", where the adverb 
refers to MANNER of MOTION), it is also 
stated that when this verb is used with the 
auxiliary essere (and, therefore, isunaccusative) 
it implies a GOAL. 
Italian may express at once, as noted above, the 
fact of motion and a GOAL, but also motion 
plus SOURCE or PATH, with such verbs like 
entrare,  uscire,  passare ,  sal i re,  etc., which 
have direct counterparts in English, even if 
"these verbs (and the sentence patterns they call 
for) are not the most characteristic of English", 
according to Talmy, (1985: 72); indeed verbs 
such as enter ,  exit,  pass ,  descend,  etc. are 
borrowings from Romance. The fact that this 
kind of conflation is typical of Italian (and 
Romance) but not of English is further 
demonstrated by the existence of verbs such as 
the above mentioned coricarsi, or esulare (to go 
into exile), etc. which have no direct 
correspondent verbs in English. Also with 
respect to these verbs we find useful information 
within dictionary definitions, as can 
be seen in the examples below: 
? entrare : andare ~ (GRZ, 1) 
? salire : andare vCr,so l'~lto, insu (GRZ, 1) 
? uscire : andare f~_~_ (GRZ, 1) 
(patterns indicating PATH / GOAL have been 
underlined). 
According to Talmy, then, motion can never be 
conflated with PURPOSE. Nevertheless, among 
the verbs we analysed there are some which 
seem to incorporate a purpose together with 
motion. Passare  is defined (in GRZ, 1) as: 
"muoversi attraversando, percorrendo un luogo, 
per andare in un altro" ("to move crossing one 
place, in order to go to another one"), where 
"per andare in" refers to the purpose of the 
action indicated by the verb. I fpassare has to be 
seen as having this component ofmeaning, then 
all its hyponyms hould inherit it and so there 
would be some verbs indicating at once motion 
and purpose 8. 
Levin and Rappaport (1991) further investigated 
intransitive motion verbs and claimed that, on 
the basis of their syntactic behaviour / semantic 
features, it was possible to distinguish among 
three classes of intransitive motion verbs: 
1) arr ive verbs (unaccusative, implying a 
component ofmeaning DIREC'I'ION and telic); 
2) run verbs (unergative; components of 
meaning MANNER of MOTION + 
PROTAGONIST CONTROL / NO DIRECT 
EXTERNAL CAUSE); 
3) roll verbs (unaccusative; components of 
meaning MANNER of MOTION + NO 
PROTAGONIST CONTROL / DIRECT 
EXTERNAL CAUSE). 
Furthermore, these classes can be related 
systematically to Vendlerian classification (based 
on Aktior~art distinctions; Vendler (1967)). 
Information found within intransitive motion 
verb definitions, therefore, was used also for 
dividing verbs according to the distinctions 
individuated by Levin & Rappaport. 
By analysing our data we found evidence that 
the component of meaning which is relevant to 
identify "arrive" verbs is that of GOAL 
(DIRECTION); furthermore, the component of 
GOAL seems to be relevant also when it is 
missing. That is, the lack of such a component 
indicates manner of motion, even if we do not 
find patterns related to MANNER within the 
definition. Vo lare  (GRZ, 1) is defined as 
"muoversi in aria" ("to move in the air"), where 
"in aria" indicates the MEDIUM and not the 
manner of motion. However, the fact that we do 
not find an indication of a GOAL component 
seems sufficient for classifying the verb as a 
manner of motion verb and not a change of 
position one. In order to decide, then, if it is a 
"run" or a "roll" verb (see above) we use the 
information oll unaccusativity / unergativity, 
since in our dictionaries we do not find any 
references tothe existence of control on the part 
of an agent. Actually, further study seems to be 
needed with respect to such a component of 
meaning and its relation to unaccusativity / 
unergattvlty, because by analysing our data we 
found manner of motion unaccusative verbs 
which seem to imply protagonist control (which 
would contradict the hypothesis put forward by 
Levin and Rappaport). 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper it has been shown how, by 
ACRES DE COLING-92. NAN'fI'S. 23-28 AOt~'r 1992 1 3 I 8 PROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
combin ing  theoret ical  assumpt ions  with 
empir ical  observat ions,  it is possib le to 
individuate information to be used for building a 
computat iona l  lex icon for NLP with in 
dictionaries. At the moment,  we are working 
both for automating the various stages of  the 
analysis and for encoding the information 
extracted in the multi-lingual LKB which we are 
bui ld ing (which uses a typed system of  
unification as representation language). At the 
same time, our data should be related to data 
from the other dictionaries used within the 
project.

Knowledge for NLP". Research teams from the 
Universittes of Amsterdam Barcelona, Cambridge, 
Dublin and Pisa are collaborating w thin this project. 
2 In Pisa two dictionaries of Italian, ,are being used: the 
Nuovo Dizionario Garzanti (GRZ) and the Dlzionario- 
Macchina dell'ltaliano (DMI), a MRD mainly based on the 
"Vocabolario della lingua Italiana" Zingarelli. 
Furthermore, we also utilize the Collins bi-lingualTtalian- 
English dictionary. 
3 As a matter of fact, not all definitions are structured in
this way. Indeed, other relations (like, e. g., PART- 
WHOLE relation) are found. However. as lar as verb 
definitions are concerned only IS-A relations are found (at 
least in our dictionaries). 
4 In our dictionaries there is no explicit statement about 
the difference among reflexive verbs inherently reflexive 
verbs and those rgahve verbs which h~ve areflexive form 
(cf. Burzio (1986:36 ff.)). Furthermore. the terminology 
used in the two Italian sources is different; however, frr 
the time being, we have maintained the terminology which 
we find. 
5 This information is extracted by analysing the 
definition(s) given for the genus term itself m the 
dictionary being used. Then after building taxonomies 
automatically, for each genus term we have to choose 
manually (there is no possibility to do it automatically as 
far as our mono-lingual Italian dictionaries are concerned) 
in which sense, among those found within its definitions, 
the genus term is used in the definitions of its hyponyms. 
6 Actually, a PP with the preposition a may have other 
semantic values; however, within motion verb taxonomies 
extracted from our dictionaries it may only have the two 
values hown. 
7 Talmy (1985: 141) distinguishes between "translational" 
and "contained" motion: "m the former, an object's basic 
location shifts from one point to another in space. In the 
latter, the object keeps its same basic, or 'average' 
location". As a matter of fact. when he says that Romance 
languages cannot conflate Motion and Manner he rather 
seems to refer to "translational motion". 
8 It is necessary to say that within DMI definition of 
passare there is no reference to a PURPOSE. However. 
we are using different mono-lingual sources in order to 
overcome the limits which each single source present and 
that have often been emphasized; so when we find 
information in one dictionary which is missing in the 
other, we generally keep it and consider it as more 
significant than its lack.
