Whither Written Language Evaluation?

Common evaluations have grown to be a major component of all 
the ARPA Human Language Technology programs. In the written 
language community, the largest evaluation program has been the 
series of Message Understanding Conferences, which began in 1987 
\[2,3\]. These evaluations have focussed on the task of analyzing 
text and automatically filling templates describing certain classes 
of events. These conferences have certainly been a major impetus 
in the development of systems for performing such "information 
extraction" tasks, and thus in demonstrating the potential practical 
value of some of the written language processing technology. 
There have been a number of concerns expressed, however, about 
the trend of these valuations. First, these valuations - - and par- 
ticularly the most recent, MUC-5 - -  have consumed large amounts 
of time, and in particular time spent learning and encoding detailed 
information about he domain, rather than learning about how to 
process language ingeneral. Second, there has been a focus on tech- 
nologies which are effective for this task hut may not be effective 
for other, "language understanding" tasks. 
In response to these concerns, a group of ARPA contractors and 
Government representatives met on December 2-4 in San Diego to 
plan for the next written language evaluation conference (MUC-6). 
This paper is a report on the conclusions of this meeting and some 
of the electronic nterchanges which followed. 
1. EVALUATION GOALS 
Although the group met under the banner of MUC ("Message Un- 
derstanding Conference"), it examined the issues of the evaluation 
of written language processing systems more generally, and did not 
limit itself to the types of evaluations conducted in past MUCs, 
which had been restricted to "information extraction" (template fill- 
hag). The group began by considering the aims of such evaluations, 
which include 
? assessing progress in written language understanding (and in 
particular, of ARPA's Tipster Phase 2 technology program) 
? guiding research and pushing the technology (by identifying 
problems that need to be addressed) 
? maintaining and increasing the interest and participation of
potential users (by demonsl~ating systems which are "rele- 
vant" to practical applications) 
? drawing more research groups into the evaluation process 
(and thus fostering the exchange of new ideas) 
? lessening substantially the overhead associated with evalua- 
tions 
To meet hese various goals, the group proposed that MUC-6 consist 
of a menu of different evaluations. The evaluations would be run 
on a single test set, but there would be separate valuation scores 
measuring different capabilities. Individual sites would be free to 
participate in any subset of the evaluations. (Of course, for sites 
which choose- or feel obligated - to participate to the maximum, 
the richness of the menu which was developed may work against the 
stated goal of reducing the evaluation overhead.) 
The group decided that he corpus hould consist of business-related 
articles from American ewspapers and wire services. A large corpus 
of such texts, part of the corpora for the recent TREC (Text Retrieval 
Evaluation) Conferences, i  available through the Linguistic Data 
Consortium. This includes articles from the Wall Street Journal, the 
San Jose Mercury News, and the AP newswire. 
2. THE MENU 
The menu of evaluations will include rather different types of tasks in 
order to meet he range of objectives cited above. On the one hand, 
we want to continue valuation on tasks - -  such as "information 
extraction"-- which can he seen as prototypes for real applications, 
and so wiU continue to draw interest from outside the natural lan- 
guage processing community. We would like to make these tasks 
as simple as possible, consistent with a semblance ofreality, so that 
evaluationper se  does not become amajor time drain. 
On the other hand, we are interested inexploring "glass box" eval- 
uations - -  evaluations of the ability of systems to identify crucial 
linguistic relationships which we believe are relevant to a high level 
of performance on a wide variety of language understanding tasks. 
Of course, some people will believe that we have chosen the wrong 
relationships, or at least hat natural language systems need not make 
these relationships explicit in the process of performing a natural lan- 
guage analysis task, and so will decline to participate in some or all 
of the glass box evaluations. We respect these disagreements, and 
have organized the menu of evaluations totake them into account. 
Any particular choice of internal evaluations ecessarily represents 
some bet on the path of technical development. However, we be- 
lieve that the relationships we have selected are sufficiently basic 
to understanding that he bet is worth taking, and that by encourag- 
ing work on these tasks we will push research on natural language 
understanding i  ways which would not be possible with a limited 
application task such as information extraction. 
The menu we came up with includes one task (named entity recog- 
nition) which, is sufficiently basic to be characterized as both an 
internal and an application task; four internal evaluations; and two 
application-oriented evaluations:

1. Named Entity Recognition: Identify company names, or- 
. ganization ames, personal names, location names, product 
names, dates, times, and money. 
2. Parseval: Bracket he syntactic onstituents of the sentence. 
3. Predicate-Argument Structure: Identify the relationship be- 
tween lexical elements in terms of relations uch as logical- 
subject, logical-object, etc. 
4. WordSense Disambiguation: Identify the word sense of each 
noun, verb, adjective, and adverb in the text, using the inven- 
tory of word senses from WordNet 
5. Coreference Resolution: Identify identity of reference, su- 
perset, and subset relations among text elements, as well as 
situations where a text element is an implicit argument of 
another (e.g., a subject or object of a nominalization which 
appears elsewhere in the text). 
6. Mini-MUC: Identify instances of a particular class of event in 
the text, and fill a template with the crucial information about 
each instance. 
7. Cross-Document Coreference: Identify coreference r lations 
between objects and events in different articles. 
Evaluations 3, 4, and 5 are collectively known as Semeval. Each of 
the seven evaluations can be done independently, but there are poten- 
tials for using the results of the annotation for one taskin performing 
another; these relationships are shown in Figure 1. Presumably, 
most participants will generate predicate-argument structure from 
parser output, so for them good Parseval performance would be a 
prerequisite for good performance on the predicate-argument met- 
ric. Recognition of named entities is essential for good performance 
on both Semeval and Mini-MUC. Some people will want to use 
the Semeval processing/output for the Mini-MUC, and some peo- 
ple won't; it is an interesting scientific question whether it helps. 
Cross-Document Coreference r quires the output of MIni-MUC. 
It will be possible for a site to investigate only one of these links, if 
they wished, rather than starting from the raw text input. This would 
allow people to build on others' work on named entity recognition, or 
to assess, assuming perfect or typical results on Semeval, how well 
one could do on Mini-MUC. Moreover, sites may be required to not 
only do a run using the (perfectly correct) key for the input to their 
component, but also using the (imperfect) actual results of some 
site participating in the full evaluation, which would be publicly 
available. (This might be arranged by staggering the evaluations, 
with the component evaluations scheduled before the mini-MUC 
evaluation.) These experiments would be analogous to the written- 
language-only part of the SLS evaluations. 
3. THE EVALUATIONS 
In this section we briefly describe ach of the seven evaluation tasks. 
For each task we shall need to prepare a sample of text annotated 
with the information we wish the systems under evaluation to ex- 
tract. To make the annotations more manageable and inspectable, we 
have combined the annotations for named entity recognition, coref- 
erence, and word sense identification. They are all encoded using 
an SGML tagging of the text, with separate attributes to record each 
type of information. Merging the annotations does not mean that the 
corresponding evaluations will be combined. We still expect hat 
these three evaluations will be scored separately, and that text can be 
separately annotated for the three evaluations) 
To illustrate some of the annotations, members of the MUC-6 com- 
mittee have annotated one of the "joint venture" news articles from 
the MUC-5 evaluation. The first two sentences of this article are: 
Bridgestone Sports Co. said Friday it has set up a joint 
venture in Talwan with a local concern and a Japanese 
trading house to produce golf clubs to be shipped to 
Japan. The joint venture, Bridgestone Sports Taiwan 
Co., capitalized at 20 million New Talwan Dollars, 
will start production in January 1990 with production 
of 20,000 iron and "metal wood" clubs a month. 
The named-entity / coreference / word sense annotation is shown 
in Figures 2 and 3; the predicate-argument a notation is shown in 
Figure 4. All of these annotations are very preliminary; we expect 
they will be revised as annotation progresses. 
3.1. Named Entity Recognition 
The experience with MUC-5 indicated that recognition of company, 
organization, people, and location names is an essential ingredient 
in understanding business news articles, and is to a considerable 
degree separable from the other problems of language interpretation. 
In addition, such recognition can be of practical value by itself in 
tracking people and organizations in large volume of text. As a 
result, this evaluation may appeal to firms focussed on this limited 
task, who are not involved in more general language understanding. 
In Figures 2 and 3, the named entity recognition is reflected in all 
the SGML elements besides wd: entity for companies and other 
organizations, loc and complex-loc for locations, num for numbers 
(including percentages), date, and money. Additional element types 
would be provided for other constructs involving specialized lexical 
patterns, such as times and people's names. For most of these 
elements, one of the attributes gives a normalized form: the decimal 
1 Although it will be simpler if at least he demarcation ofnamed entities 
is performed first.

3.2. Parseval 
Parseval is a measure of the ability of a system to bracket he syn- 
tactic constituents in a sentence. This metric has now been in use 
for several years, and has been described elsewhere \[1\]. Parseval 
may eventually be supplanted in large part by the "deeper" and more 
detailed predicate-argument valuation. However, for the present 
Parseval is being retained in order to accomodate participants fo- 
cussed on surface grammar and participants reluctant o commit 
to predicate-argument valuation until its design is stabilized and 
proven. 
3.3. Predicate-argument structure 
A very tentative predicate-argument structure for our two sentences 
is shown in Figure 4. As much as possible, we have tried to use 
the same structures which have been adopted by the Spoken Lan- 
guage Coordinating Committee for their predicate-argument valu- 
ation. We summarize here, with some simplifications, only the most 
essential aspects of this representation. 
For each event or state in the text, we introduce aDavidsonian event 
variable i, and treat the type and each argument of the event as a 
separate predication. So, for example, Fred fed Francis on Friday 
would be represented as2 
(ev-type 1 eat) 
(1-subj 1 Fred) 
(1-obj 1 Francis) 
(on 1 Friday) 
Each elementary predication can be numbered by preceding it with 
a number and colon. Roughly speaking, a system would be scored 
on the number of such elementary predications it gets correct. Be- 
cause this notation is none too readable, however, we also allow the 
abbreviated form 
(eat \]event 1\] \[1-subj Fred\] \[1-obj Francis\] \[on Friday\]) 
where \[event 1\] could be omitted if there were no other references 
to the event variable. An entity, arising from a noun phrase with 
determiner det will be represented by 
2Assuming that on is a primitive predicate, which is not expanded using 
an event variable. Otherwise we would have the predications (ev-type 2on), 
O-subj 2 1), and (l-obj 2 Friday).

Figure 3: Named entity / word sense / coreference annotation of second sentence. 
e: (det <restrl restr2 ...>) 
Each restri is a constraint on the entity, stated as a predication 
on index e. Thus "the brown cow which licked Fred" would be 
represented by 
1: (the <(brown \[1-subj 1\]) (cow \[1-subj 1\]) 
(lick \[1-subj 1\] \[1-obj Fred\])>) 
The notation "?i" means that i is optional; the notation i / j means 
that either i or j  is allowed. 
The written language group, however, is not taking the same ap- 
proach to the selection of predicates and role-names as the spoken 
language group. The spoken language group aspires to a truly se- 
mantic representation, i dependent of the particular syntactic form 
in which it was expressed. This seems feasible in the highly circum- 
scribed omain of air traffic information. It does not seem a feasible 
near-term goal for all of language, or even for all of "business news", 
which is a very broad domain. Instead we will be initially using a 
form of grammatical functional structure, with lexical items as heads 
(predicate types), and role names uch as logical subject and logical 
object. The representation will be normalized with respect o only 
a limited number of syntactic alternations, uch as passive, dative 
with "for", and dative with "to". I expect hat the representation 
will gradually evolve to normalize a larger number of paraphrastic 
alternations. 
3.4. Coreference 
Coreference can be annotated either at the level of the word se- 
quence or at the level of predicate-argument structure. By recording 
coreference atthe word level, we lose some distinctions that can be 
captured at predicate-argument l vel. On the other hand, annotating 
at the word level allows for evaluation of coreference without gener- 
ating predicate-argument structure. So - -  in order to keep the menu 
items as independent as possible - -  our current plan is to annotate 
coreference at the word level, with the head word of the anaphor 
pointing to the head word of the antecedent. 
Coreference is recorded through attributes in the SGML annotation 
(Figures 2 and 3). For purposes of reference, lements are annotated 
with an ident attribute. Identity of reference is indicated by an 
attribute identical pointing to the antecedent. A superset/subset 
relation is indicated by asub-ofattribute. Finally, if a predication has 
implicit arguments which are coreferential with prior text elements, 
they are annotated as args = "\[role antecedent\]".

3.5. Word sense identification 
The third element of the Semeval triad is sense identification. As a 
sense inventory, we hayed used WordNet, which is widely and freely 
available and is broad in coverage \[4\]. The notation used to refer to 
particular WordNet sense was described in \[5\]. 
3.6. Mini-MUC 
This component is the direct descendant of the information extrac- 
tion tasks in the previous MUCs \[2,3\]? In response to criticism that 
the evaluation task had gotten too complex, we have endeavored to 
make the new information extraction as simple as possible? The tem- 
plate will have a hierarchical structure, as in MUC-5, but probably 
with only two levels of "objects". The objects at the lower level will 
represent common business news entities uch as people and compa- 
nies. A small inventory of such objects will be defined in advance. 
The upper level object will then be a simple structure with perhaps 
four or five slots, to capture the information about a particular type 
of event. 
The following were suggested astypical of such templates:

4. PLANS 
The menu of evaluations which has been developed for MUC-6 is 
certainly ambitious; perhaps it is too ambitious and will need to 
be scaled back. While the cost of participating in a single one of 
these evaluations should be much less than the effolt required for 
MUC-5, the effort to prepare all these evaluations will be consid- 
erable. Detailed specifications will need to be developed for each 
of the evaluations, and substantial nnotated corpora will have to be 
developed, both as the "case law" for subsequent evaluations and 
as a training corpus for trainable analyzers. If this is all success- 
ful, however, it holds the promise for fostering advances in several 
aspects of natural language understanding. 
A description of the menu of evaluations was disseminated lec- 
tronically at the end of December 1993. Further details, including 
a sample annotated message, were distributed at the end of Febru- 
ary 1994. After a period of public electronic omment, we shall 
be recruiting volunteer sites to begin annotating texts, slowly over 
the course of the spring, as the specifications are ironed out, more 
rapidly over the summer, once specifications are more stable. 
A dry run evaluation, possibly including only a subset of the menu 
items, will be conducted in late fall of 1994; MUC-6 is tentatively 
scheduled for May of 1995.

Because of the simplicity of these templates, a month was felt to be 
sufficient time for developing aparticular extraction system. In fact, 
because of concern that a single template introduced too much risk 
due to possible faulty template/problem design, itwas suggestedthat 
working on three closely related topics within a single month might 
be desirable. 
3.7. Cross-document coreference 
One way in which prior MUC tasks were unrealistic s that hey did 
not attempt to link events across documents, even though the corpus 
frequently included multiple documents about he same event. To 
remedy this shortcoming, it was suggested that the task of making 
such event coreference links across documents be included as an 
additional item on the evaluation menu.
