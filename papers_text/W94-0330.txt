PIETER A.M. SEUREN, HENK P. SCHOTEL: SEMANTIC SYNTAX AT WORK 
Nijmegen University, Dept. of General Linguistics 
MAINE, JUNE '94 
SEMANTIC SYNTAX (SeSyn) is a direct continuation of work done in the '60s and '70s under the name of GENERATIVE 
SEMANTICS. The main component of SeSyn is a rule system (the syntax) which transforms the Semantic Analysis 
(SA) of any given sentence into a Surface Structure (SS) of that sentence. The SAs represent meanings ina higher order 
Predicate Calculus, according to a small set of context-free Formation Rules and a Lexicon. SA-trees have simple 
branchings and deep S-embeddings. They are input o the Transformation Rules, which deliver a corresponding SS. The 
Transformation Rules fall into two classes, the rules of the Cycle, and those of the Postcycle. The cyclic rules start 
with the most deeply embedded S and end with the top-S. They are mostly lexicon-driven: predicates are lexically 
marked for the cyclic rules they induce. The largely structure-driven postcyclic rules apply in linear order as defined by 
the grammar. The output is near-surface: it is meant to link up with a morphology module, to be complemented with a 
phonology module. Schotel has implemented the rule system for English in Prolog. The following diagram shows the 
place of SeSyn in the wider context of a cognitive ("text-level") discourse-semantics:

The generation ofEnglish sentences will be demonstrated, with emphasis on the auxiliary system, (including 
tense, adverb placement, negation, the modals) and the complementation system. It is claimed that he theory of SeSyn 
makes for a subtler and more precise coverage of the facts of the languages treated than any other grammar system on 
either the theoretical orthe computer linguistics market. It moreover appears that language-specific differences amount 
largely to different postcyclic rule orderings, to different parameter settings in otherwise identical rules, to different 
lexical inductions of cyclic rules, or to different positions in the formation rules. When more grammars of different 
? languages are available apartial parametrization f the general theory should be feasible: the phenomena, in particular 
those relating to the Posteycle, do not offer a realistic hope for complete parametrization. 
SeSyn rule systems exist for English, French, German, Dutch. In these languages they deal principally with 
the auxiliary system (including tense, adverb placement, negation, the modals) and sentential complementation. Hardly 
any attention has been paid so far to the internal structure of NPs. The SeSyn grammar for French also contains, a
precise treatment ofthe clitic clusters. The Dutch grammar contains rules for verbal end clusters. Extensions are in an 
advanced stage of preparation for quantification phenomena, conjunction reduction. Application to Turkish is envisaged 
within a year.
