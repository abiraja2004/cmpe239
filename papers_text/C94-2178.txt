Abstract 
Various methods have been proposed for aligning 
texts in two or more languages such as the 
Canadian Parliamentary Debates (Hansards). Some 
of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a 
by-product. We present an alternative alignment 
strategy which we call K-vec, that starts by 
estimating the lexicon. For example, it discovers 
that the English word fisheries is similar to the 
French p~ches by noting that the distribution of 
fisheries in the English text is similar to the 
distribution of p~ches in the French. K-vec does 
not depend on sentence boundaries. 
1. Motivation 
There have been quite a number of recent papers on 
parallel text: Brown et al(1990, 1991, 1993), Chen 
(1993), Church (1993), Church et al(1993), Dagan 
et al(1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), 
Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), 
Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), 
Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), 
Shemtov (1993), Simard et al(1992), Warwick- 
Armstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear). 
Most of this work has been focused on European 
language pairs, especially English-French. It 
remains an open question how well these methods 
might generalize to other language pairs, especially 
pairs such as English-Japanese and English- 
Chinese. 
In previous work (Church et al 1993), we have 
reported some preliminary success in aligning the 
English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual 
(Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using 
charalign (Church, 1993), a method that looks for 
character sequences that are the same in both the 
source and target. The charalign method was 
designed for European language pairs, where 
cognates often share character sequences, e.g., 
government and gouvernement. In general, this 
approach doesn't work between languages uch as 
English and Japanese which are written in different 
alphabets. The AWK manual happens to contain a 
large number of examples and technical words that 
are the same in the English source and target 
Japanese. 
It remains an open question how we might be able 
to align a broader class of texts, especially those 
that are written in different character sets and share 
relatively few character sequences. The K-vec 
method attempts to address this question. 
2. The K-vec Algorithm 
K-vec starts by estimating the lexicon. Consider 
the example: fisheries --~ p~ches. The K-vec 
algorithm will discover this fact by noting that the 
distribution of fisheries in the English text is 
similar to the distribution of p~ches in the French. 
The concordances for fisheries and p~ches are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of this paper). 1
1. These tables were computed from a small fragment ofthe 
Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other 
studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al(1992). The 
English text has 165,160 words and the French text has 
185,615 words. 
1096 
There are 19 instances of fisheries and 21 instances 
of p~ches. The numbers along the left hand edge 
show where the concordances were found in the 
texts. We want to know whether the distribution of 
numbers in Table 1 is similar to those in Table 2, 
and if so, we will suspect hat fisheries and p~ches 
are translations of one another. A quick look at the 
two tables suggests that the two distributions are 
probably very similar, though not quite identical. 2 
We use a simple representation f the distribution 
of fisheries and p~ches. The English text and the 
French text were each split into K pieces. Then we 
determine whether or not the word in question 
appears in each of the K pieces. Thus, we denote 
the distribution of fisheries in the English text with 
a K-dimensional binary vector, VU, and similarly, 
we denote the distribution of p~ches in the French 
text with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vp. The 
i th bit of Vf indicates whether or not Fisheries 
occurs in the i th piece of the English text, and 
similarly, the ith bit of Vp indicates whether or not 
p~ches occurs in the i th piece of the French text. 
If we take K be 10, the first three instances of 
fisheries in Table 1 fall into piece 2, and the 
remaining 16 fall into piece 8. Similarly, the first 4 
instances of pgches in Table 2 fall into piece 2, and 
the remaining 17 fall into piece 8. Thus, 
VT= Vp = <2 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0 > 
Now, we want to know if VT is similar to Vp, and if 
we find that it is, then we will suspect that fisheries 
---> p~ches. In this example, of course, the vectors 
are identical, so practically any reasonable 
similarity statistic ought to produce the desired 
result. 
3. fisheries is not file translation of lections 
Before describing how we estimate the similarity of 
Vf and Vp, let us see what would happen if we tried 
to compare fisheries with a completely unrelated 
word, eg., lections. (This word should be the 
translation of elections, not fisheries.) 
2. At most, fisheries can account for only 19 instances of 
p~ches, leaving at least 2 instances ofp~ches unexplained. 
As can be seen in the concordances in Table 3,  for 
K=10, the vector is <1, 1, 0, 1, 1,0, 1, 0, 0, 0>. By 
almost any measure of similarity one could 
imagine, this vector will be found to be quite 
different from the one for fisheries, and therefore, 
we will correctly discover that fisheries is not the 
translation of lections. 
To make this argument a little more precise, it 
might help to compare the contingency matrices in 
Tables 5 and 6. The contingency matrices show: 
(a) the number of pieces where both the English 
and French word were found, (b) the number of 
pieces where just the English word was found, (c) 
the number of pieces where just the French word 
was found, and (d) the number of peices where 
neither word was found.

In general, if the English and French words are 
good translations of one another, as in Table 5, then 
a should be large, and b and c should be small. In 
contrast, if the two words are not good translations 
of one another, as in Table 6, then a should be 
small, and b and c should be large. 
4. Mutual Information 
Intuitively, these statements seem to be true, but we 
need to make them more precise. One could have 
chosen quite a number of similarity metrics for this 
purpose. We use mutual information: 
1097 
prob ( VI, Vp ) 
log2 prob(Vf) prob(Vp )
That is, we want to compare the probability of 
seeing fisheries and p~ches in the same piece to 
chance. The probability of seeing the two words in 
the same piece is simply: 
a 
prob(Vf, Vp) -  a+b+c+d 
The marginal probabilities are: 
a+b 
prob(Vf ) -  a+b+c+d 
a+c 
prob(Vp) = a+b+c+d 
For fisheries --~ p~ches, prob(Vf, Vp) =prob(Vf) 
=prob(Vp) =0.2. Thus, the mutual information is 
log25 or 2.32 bits, meaning that the joint 
probability is 5 times more likely than chance. In 
contrast, for fisheries ~ lections, prob ( V f, V p ) = O, 
prob(Vf) =0.5 and prob(Vp) = 0.4. Thus, the 
mutual information is log 2 0, meaning that the joint 
is infinitely less likely than chance. We conclude 
that it is quite likely that fisheries and p~ches are 
translations of one another, much more so than 
fisheries and lections. 
5. Significance 
Unfortunately, mutual information is often 
unreliable when the counts are small. For example, 
there are lots of infrequent words. If we pick a pair 
of these words at random, there is a very large 
chance that they would receive a large mutual 
information value by chance. For example, let e be 
an English word that appeared just once and le t fbe  
a French word that appeared just once. Then, there 
a non-trivial chance (-~) that e andf  will appear is 
in the same piece, as shown in Table 7. If this 
should happen, the mutual information estimate 
would be very large, i.e., logK, and probably 
misleading. 
Table 7: 
f 
e 1 0 
0 9 
In order to avoid this problem, we use a t-score to 
filter out insignificant mutual information values. 
prob ( Vf, Vp ) - prob (Vf) prob ( Vp ) 
t= 
1 prob(Vf,gp) 
Using the numbers in Table 7, t=l ,  which is not 
significant. (A t of 1.65 or more would be 
significant at the p > 0.95 confidence level.) 
Similarly, if e and f appeared in just two pieces 
1 
each, then there is approximately a ~ chance that 
they would both appear in the same two pieces, and 
then the mutual information score would be quite 
log, ,  ~--, but we probably wouldn't believe it high, 
Z.  
because the t-score would be only "~-. By this 
definition of significance, we need to see the two 
words in at least 3 different pieces before the result 
would be considered significant. 
This means, unfortunately, that we would reject 
fisheries --+ p~ches because we found them in only 
two pieces. The problem, of course, is that we 
don't have enough pieces. When K=10, there 
simply isn't enough resolution to see what's going 
on. At K=100, we obtain the contingency matrix 
shown in Table 8, and the t-score is significant 
(t=2.1). 
Table 8:K=100 
p~ches 
fisheries 5

94 
How do we choose K? As we have seen, if we 
choose too small a K, then the mutual information 
values will be unreliable. However, we can only 
increase K up to a point. If we set K to a 
ridiculously large value, say the size of the English 
text, then an English word and its translations are 
likely to fall in slightly different pieces due to 
random fluctuations and we would miss the signal. 
For this work, we set K to the square root of the 
size of the corpus. 
K should be thought of as a scale parameter. If we 
use too low a resolution, then everything turns into 
a blur and it is hard to see anything. But if we use 
too high a resolution, then we can miss the signal if 
7098 
it isn't just exactly where we are looking. 
Ideally, we would like to apply the K-vec algorithm 
to all pairs of English and French words, but 
unfortunately, there are too many such pairs to 
consider. We therefore limited the search to pairs 
of words in the frequency range: 3-10. This 
heuristic makes the search practical, and catches 
many interesting pairs) 
6. Results 
This algorithm was applied to a fragment of the 
Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number 
of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al
(1992). The 30 significant pairs with the largest 
mutual information values are shown in Table 9. 
As can be seen, the results provide a quick-and- 
dirty estimate of a bilingual exicon. When the pair 
is not a direct translation, it is often the translation 
of a collocate, as illustrated by acheteur ~ Limited 
and Santd -~ Welfare. (Note that some words in 
Table 9 are spelled with same way in English and 
French; this information is not used by the K-vec 
algorithm). 
Using a scatter plot technique developed by Church 
and Helfman (1993) called dotplot, we can visulize 
the alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1. The 
source text (Nx bytes) is concatenated to the target 
text (Ny bytes) to form a single input sequence of 
Nx+Ny bytes. A dot is placed in position i,j 
whenever the input token at position i is the same 
as the input token at position j. 
The equality constraint is relaxed in Figure 2. A 
dot is placed in position i,j whenever the input 
token at position i is highly associated with the 
input token at position j as determined by the 
mutual information score of their respective K- 
vecs. In addition, it shows a detailed, magnified 
and rotated view of the diagonal line. The 
alignment program tracks this line with as much 
precision as possible. 
3. The low frequency words (frequency less then 3) would 
have been rejected anyways as insignificant.

7. Conclusions 
The K-vec algorithm generates a quick-and-dirty 
estimate of a bilingual exicon. This estimate could 
be used as a starting point for a more detailed 
alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et 
al, 1993). In this way, we might be able to apply 
word_align to a broader class of language 
combinations including possibly English-Japanese 
and English-Chinese. Currently, word_align 
depends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generate 
a starting point, which limits its applicability to 
European languages since char_align was designed 
for language pairs that share a common alphabet.
