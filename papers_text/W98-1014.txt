ABSTRACT 
Since no computer based dictionaries exist for 
Maltese, the only analysis that can be made at 
present is rule based. The paper describes a rule 
based system taking into account the mixed 
origins, (semitic and romance), of Maltese to 
categorise function and verb words. The system 
separates the database, the rule formalisms and 
the rule definitions, enabling easier analysis and 
quicker changes to rules when necessary. 
~ITRODUCHON 
Maltese is written in Roman script using 30 
letters made up of six vowels and twenty four 
consonants. Of particular interest are two 
graphemes gh and ie which though written as 
two letters are actually considered as one 
grapheme in the language. A recent survey, 
based on the most well known Maltese 
dictionary \[l\], found that the origin of the 
words is 40% Semitic, 40% Romance (Italian) 
and 20% English. The linguistic processing has 
therefore to take into account this mixed 
structure. The purpose of this work was to 
analyse the words to try and distinguish 
function words and verb words in the running 
text, within a text-to-speech synthesis 
application. This is necessary to obtain pause 
information at appropriate word boundaries. 
Therefore only a partial exical analysis is being 
considered. The method used here involves a 
rule based system with separation between the 
rule definitions, the rule operations and the 
input data formalism. Two databases have the 
function words and the verb words respectively, 
to compare with the word under test. The rule 
formalisms are kept in small local tables 
pertaining to the various rules under test. In this 
way addition/deletion f the data is completely 
independent of the rule formalism, and rules 
can be added or amended independently of each 
other. 
MALTESE HNGUISTICS 
As in other Semitic languages, Maltese words 
of semitic origin do not have a stem to which 
affixes are connected, but rather use transfixes. 
The stem or root is made up of a number of 
consonants, which can never occur in isolation, 
and whose order cannot be altered. Transfixes 
are then added to the root, sometimes also with 
prefixes and suffixes. Transfixes are made up 
of a number of vowels and may include 
operation on consonants such as doubling the 
middle consonant, (geminate). On the other 
hand, words of Romance origin follow the 
usual pattern of a stem and affixes of the 
inflectional and derivational type to form other 
lexemes. For example the semitic derivations 
from k,t,b are 
kiteb to write 
kitba writing 
ktib writings 
ktieb book 
ktejjeb small book 
kittieb writer 
mikteb writing desk 
nkiteb to be written 
while romance derivations from 
deft 
adderta 
dertezza 
dertezzi 
dertam ent

~-'UNCZON WORDS 
Function words in Maltese are classified as 
p~tidelli and pronomi and they are made up of 
pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, 
interjections and adverbs. These can in turn be 
distinct words hawn, hekk, gSal, qabel, 
jien 
have personal pronoun suffixes g$~ alina, 
qablek 
composite hawnhekk, g~alhekk 
short phrases fuq il-qalb, sewwa sew 
In addition the definite article is added to the 
list of function words. The dictionary by 
Aquilina was used to obtain a comprehensive 
list of function words, for the database. 
Some function words use inflectional 
morphemes as suffixes. The definite article and 
function words that assimilate the definite 
article change their final letter for some 
consonants, distinguished as xemxin. Therefore 
morphological nalysis is essential to keep the 
function word database to a reasonable size. 
The function word types are also distinguished 
for the purposes of the application as 
article il-, ir- 
pronoun fien, huma 
adverb hekk, sewwa 
conjunction u, jekk, mela 
prepositions assimilating the article mas-, fil-, 
ta' 
This subdivision is important as it helps in the 
syntactic analysis. The definite article is 
associated with a noun or adjective, the 
pronoun is associated with a noun phrase, a 
conjunction i troduces a phrase, and the adverb 
indicates a verb phrase. Many function words 
can be of more than one type, and depend on 
the sentence syntax for the outcome. 
WORDS 
Verb words in Maltese can be, like in other 
languages, conjugated in the present and past 
tense. There is no formal future tense, as in 
Italian, and auxiliary verbs are used to obtain 
other tenses. In general the present ense has 
prefixes to distinguish person, and suffixes to 
distinguish quantity. The past tense has suffixes 
to distinguish both person and quantity. In all 
of these the surface form of the stem can 
change. Like other languages there are 
numerous exceptions. Other verb words include 
the imperative, the negation of the verb and the 
passive and reflexive forms. Additionally the 
Maltese language tends to use suffixes 
extensively within verb words, to obtain generic 
accusative and dative object. For example 
nikteb 
niktibhom. 
niktibhomlok 
kitbithiel_...d 
I am writing 
I am writing them 
I am writing them, to you 
She wrote it (fem.) to me 
The number of pronoun suffixes that can be 
added to every verb is considerable, \[2\]. 
LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS 
To keep the same formalism, the same data 
structure is defined for the analysis of the 
function words and the verb words. This 
consists essentially of the stem consonants, the 
stem word, the part of speech, and the lexical 
group. The lexical group relates to the VC, 
(vowel consonant) sequence within the word. 
This order gives rise to different manipulations 
of prefixes and suffixes with the stem, and 
therefore different sets of morphological rules. 
Function Word Analysis 
The word under test is first checked for a valid 
function word. The analysis starts by looking 
for valid suffixes. The remaining stem is 
analysed for the consonants within the stem. 
The function word database is then examined 
for keys with the same consonants or more. 
Each corresponding entry has its lexical group 
which is then used for the test. The test is 
103 
according to the morphological rule appropriate 
for that lexical group. If a match is made the 
word is assigned the corresponding function 
word category stored in the function word 
database. The rule syntax is as follows. 
Removing suffix I results in a stem that has 
operations done on stem. Stem operations are 
denoted as 
(Type)(Letter Strings)(Position) (1) 
where Type can be 
(+,, -)  meaning addition, no addition, 
deletion 
or (+/ - )  meaning delete the left string 
and add the right string. 
Letter Strings are ASCII strings to add or 
delete. In cases where no operation or only one 
type of operation is to be done, the rest of the 
field is left blank. Position is optional and 
denotes where in the stem the change should 
happen. The position is with respect o the end 
(right hand side of stem). Default is 1 and 
means abut to the stem. For example 
(+)('e')(2) means add to the stem letter e at 
position 2 from end of the stem 
(+/-)(a'/ieg~) means delete the part iegL~ from 
the stem end and substitute with 
a'. 
No operation is also valid. The decision for 
validity depends on whether the resulting stem, 
after stem operations, is a valid lexeme in the 
database. 
Verb Word Analysis 
If not a valid function word, a further test is 
made to check whether it is a valid verb word. 
Verb word analysis is initially different from 
function word analysis since verb words earl 
also have prefixes. All possible consonant 
group sequences made up of two or more 
consonants from the surface word are 
considered, starting from the sequence with all 
the consonants in the surface word. Initially 
these groups are passed through the irregular 
verb list, then through the mute verb list, and 
then through the database. (Mute verbs are 
those that have a consonant in the stem that is 
missing in the surface form). Any consonant 
groupings found in the surface form that have 
entries in the dictionaries (irregular, mute or 
main) are potential candidates. For the first 
potential candidate the lexeme stem part 
defined as that part of the surface word that 
incorporates the lexeme consonants i isolated. 
If any prefix or suffix stems result, these are 
examined using the morphological rules for 
verbs. This results in either rejection since the 
affix stems cannot result in valid affixes, or 
valid affixes. If the affix stems have any 
remaining parts after valid suffix and prefix 
assignment, it is returned to the lexeme stem. 
The lexeme stem is now examined for a valid 
lexeme stem for the particular database l xeme 
under test. This is done by a separate rule set 
for each verb type. If it is validated the stem 
has the immediate prefix and suffix restored. 
(This should exclude all pronoun suffixes). This 
results in a word form (P).X.(S), where P is an 
optional prefix, and similarly for the suffix. 
This diminished surface word form is used to 
obtain, from the linguistic database for the verb 
type, the linguistic analysis for the word. 
The rules are based on the root which is the 3rd 
person singular masculine in the past ense. The 
keys of the database contain the consonants of 
the root. Sixteen verb categories are defined in 
the database. Each verb category has a number 
of formalisms, defined as VC patterns, the 
surface word is allowed in the stem part for 
that particular verb category. Each VC formal 
pattern has in turn, a set of rules : 
(prefix) + stem + (suffix) (2) 
where the optional prefix and suffix are defined 
in the rules. One entry in the rule set for verbs 
of category type Vl 1 is as follows 
j ; u +VCCC+ verb(indicative, present, 
2nd person plural) (3) 
104 
The first column has format 
<prefix 1>, <prefix 2> ..<prefix i> ; <suffix 1>, 
<suffix 2>, .. 
The meaning is any of the prefixes is valid. 
The ' ; ' is a delimiter when there are both 
prefixes and suffixes. The second column 
defines the surface stem for the current rule in 
the verb category and the valid affixes it can 
take. The stem definition is in terms of 
consonant and vowel positions. For a given root 
the stem consonants are identical to the root 
consonants in the sequence of the root 
consonants. The vowels in the stem do not 
necessarily have to be the same vowels as in 
the root. 
For example consider the word under test 
jiksruhomlok. Initially all potential aggregate of 
consecutive consonants is examined as a 
potential verb stem. In particular for the 
consecutive consonants k, s, r, the database 
yields the verb kiser, in verb category V11. 
Using (2) the affixes are 'j'i' and 'uhomlok'. 
'uhomlok' is found in the initial analysis as 
being three valid suffixes - 'u', ~om' 'lok'. 
)" is found as a valid prefix. 
The immediate affixes are returned so that the 
lexeme under test is now )'iksru'. Out of all the 
rules defined for verb category V11 to which 
kiser belongs, the rule definition (3) gives a 
valid outcome. 
For Romance verbs a corresponding rule entry 
is as follows 
n ; a,i +< >+ verb(indicative present 
first person singular) (4) 
where the < > implies the root stem which 
remains the same in all verb forms for romance 
verbs. 
For example given the word form 
nippermettilek, the consecutive consonants 
p,p,r,m,t,t find a database entry ippermetti 
under the verb category for romance verbs. 
Using (2) 'n' and 'ilek' are found as valid 
affixes. The immediate affixes are returned and 
the rule (4) is then found to be satisfied. 
RESULTS 
The rules were tested with a series of 
sentences. Errors were considered to be of two 
types. These are no classification errors when 
either a function or a verb word was not 
classified, and misclassification when a verb 
word was classified as an adjective or noun, 
and viceversa. The results gave errors of the 
first type whenever the corresponding stem was 
not in the database. Errors of type 2 occurred in 
the case of one verb category, otherwise all 
function and verb words were classified 
correctly. The error occurs because in the verb 
category CVCV the derivational morphology 
between verb and noun or adjective involves 
only a change of vowels. For example b?da_, 
(he started); b/du (start). The analysis therefore 
yields both types as being possible valid 
answers for the word, though clearly a native 
speaker can distinguish between them. One of 
the future features to be added is to use a 
vowel tier on the present morphological 
analysis tructure. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A rule based analysis suitable for a language 
with a mixed linguistic categories was 
designed. This was based on a separation of 
database and rule definitions enabling a quicker 
analysis as well as easier addition / deletion of 
rules based on a set of rule formalisms.
