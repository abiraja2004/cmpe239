the comprehension of  the sentences.  A 
s imi la r  exper iment  was then conducted 
us ing  dapanese sentences w i th  re la t ive  
c lauses ,  and exact ly  the same two 
s t ra teg ies  were found to account for  the 
data.  The Given-New s t ra tegy  was a l so  
found to p lay  an impor tant  ro le  in the 
two languages. 
Introduction 
Over the past few years ,  funct iona l  
cons iderat ions  have come to p lay  an 
impor tant  ro le  in the empi r i ca l  s tudy  of  
language comprehension processes .  This  
funct iona l  perspect ive  assumes that  
hearers  employ a set  of  perceptua l ,  ~ 
menta l ,  2 or cogn i t ive  s t ra teg ies  to 
ext ract  semant ic  in fo rmat ion  d i rec t ly  
from sur face  s t ructure .  Throughout the 
psycho l ingu is t i c  l i te ra ture ,  a wide 
var ie ty  o f  s t ra teg ies  has been proposed, 
some wi th  a syntact i c  o r ientat ion ,  and 
o thers  hav ing  a semant ic  or even a 
d i scourse  bas is .  Moreover,  some 
s t ra teg ies  appear to be language 
spec i f i c ,  wh i le  o thers  are language 
independent .  The term "perceptua l "  i s  
somewhat inappropr ia te  in th i s  context  
s ince  the processes invo lved  typ ica l ly  
do not re fer  to percept ion  in even i t s  
most genera l  sense. The more apt term 
"cogn i t ive"  w i l l  be used throughout  th i s  
paper.  
In order  to es tab l i sh  the v iab i l i ty  
and re la t ive  importance of  var ious  
s t ra teg ies ,  both s implex  and complex 
sentences have been invest igated  
exper imenta l ly .  Eng l i sh  sentences 
conta in ing  re la t ive  c lauses  prov ide  an 
espec ia l l y  r i ch  source for  exper imenta l  
s tudy,  s ince  Eng l i sh  sanct ions  re la t ive  
c lause  fo rmat ion  on NPs p \ ]ay inc  
v i r tua l ly  any grammatical  ro le ,  wh i le  
the re la t ive  pronoun (RP) can i t se l f  
p lay  a wide var ie ty  of  grammatical  ro les  
w i th  the re la t ive  c lause  (RC). For ar 
Eng l i sh  sentence conta in ing  a sub jec t ,  a 
t rans i t ive  verb,  and a d i rec t  ob jec t ,  a 
re la t ive  c lause  can be formed on e i ther  
the sub jec t  or ob jec t  NP. Moreover,  
w i th in  a re la t ive  c lause  conta in ing  a 
t rans i t ive  verb,  the re la t ive  pronour  
can i t se l f  be sub jec t  or ob jec t .  For 
such sentence types,  the fo l low ing  four  
s t ruc tures  are permi t ted ,  assuming a 
s ing le  re la t ive  c lause  per sentence:  
SSa: NP\[RP V NP\] V NP 
The man that  chased the dog saw the 
boy. 
SOa: NP \[RP NP V\] V NP 
The man that  the dog chased saw the 
boy. 
OSa: NP V NP\[RP V N P\] 
The man saw the boy that  chased the 
dog. 
OOa: NP V NP\[RP NP V\] 
The man saw the boy that  the dog 
chased. 
In the cod ing to the le f t  of  each 
s t ructure ,  the f i r s t  le t te r  represents  
the grammatical  ro le  ( sub jec t  or ob jec t )  
of  the NP on which the re la t ive  c lause 
i s  formed, wh i le  the second le t te r  
represents  the grammatical  ro le  p layed 
by the re la t ive  pronoun.  The th i rd  
le t te r  represents  the fact  that  the 
re la t ive  c lause  i s  in the ac t ive  vo ice .  
A para l le l  set  of  s t ruc tures  can be 
const ructed  in which the re la t ive  c lause  
is  in the pass ive  vo ice .  These are:  
SSp: NP\[RP be Ved by NP\] V NP 
The man that  was chased by the dog 
saw the boy. 
SOp: NP\[RP NP be Ved by\] V NP 
The man that  the dog was chased by 
saw the boy. 
OSp: NP V NP\[RP be Ved by NP\] 
60 
The man saw the Doy that  was chased 
by the dog. 
OOp: NP V NP\[RP NP be Ved by\] 
The man saw the boy that  the dog 
was chased by. 
Several s t ra teg ies  have beery 
proposed to account for  the d i f fe rent ia l  
ease of  p rocess ing  of  s t ruc tures  
conta in ing  re la t ive  c lauses ,  a~though 
most proposa ls  have concent ra ted  on 
act ives  and have not addressed the 
problem of pass ive  re la t ive  c lauses ,  
When these s t ra teg ies  are gathered 
together ,  however, i t  becomes obv ious  
that  they make d i f fe rent  p red ic t ions .  
The or ig ina l  purpose of  the research 
repor ted  here was to eva luate  four  
impor tant  s t ra teg ies  bear ing  on re la t ive  
c lause  process ing ,  in the context  of  a 
s ing le  exper iment  w i th  s t imu l i  based on 
the e ight  s t ruc tures  d i scussed  above. 
The incorporat ion  of  pass ive  re la t ive  
c lauses  was an impor tant  added 
d imens ion ,  s ince  i t  is  the pass ives  
which serve to d i f fe rent ia te  among the 
s t ra teg ies .  A re la ted  goal was to 
e l iminate  from cons iderat ion  those 
s t ra teg ies  fo r  which empi r i ca l  support  
was not fo r thcoming .  A f ina l  goal was 
to es tab l i sh  a h ie rarchy  among the 
re levant  s t ra teg ies .  
The fo l low ing  cogn i t ive  s t ra teg ies  
are a l l  re levant  to the process ing  of  
sentences conta in ing  re la t ive  c lauses :

( i .e . ,  those not separated by another  
NP) and an ad jacent  verb not a l ready  
ass igned to a c lause .  In terpret  the 
f i r s t  NP as the sub jec t  and the second 
NP as the ob jec t  of  the verb .  e 
The Para l le l  Funct ion  s t ra tegy  was 
in i t ia l l y  proposed 8 to account fo r  
Eng l i sh  acqu is i t ion  data,  a \ ] thouqh i t  
was la ter  found 9 to be far  less 
operat ive  for  adu l ts .  There are twc 
fundamental  problems assoc ia ted  w i th  
th i s  s t ra tegy .  The f i r s t  is  that  i t  is  
not c lear  whether para l le l  funct ion  is  
to be de f ined  on under ly ing  or sur face  
grammatical  ro les .  In the pass ives  
l i s ted  above, sur face  grammatical  ro les  
are ind icated  for  a l l  NPs, inc lud ing  
re la t ive  pronouns.  However, each of  
those cou ld  a l so  be in terpreted  in 
under ly ing  terms. For example, the 
re la t ive  pronoun is  const rued  as sub jec t  
in type SSp, a l though in deep s t ructure  
terms i t  is  the ob jec t .  Consequent ly ,  
two d is t inc t  vers ions  of  the s t ra tegy  
are poss ib le ,  one based on sur face  
grammatical  re la t ions  and the o ther  
based on under ly ing  re la t ions .  Both 
vers ions  are tes ted  here.  The second 
problem is  conceptua l  in nature ,  In 
par t i cu la r ,  the s t ra tegy  seems to lack 
any exp lanatory  power, s tand ing  on ly  as 
an i so la ted  statement  of  cer ta in  
resu l t s ,  w i thout  independent mot ivat ion .  
In fac t ,  even i t s  re levance  for  the 
acqu is i t ion  data has been cha l lenged.  7 
Both the Word Order and 
In ter rupt ion  s t ra teg ies  were proposed 1? 
to deal w i th  language acqu is i t ion  
phenomena, but both can read i ly  be 
t rans la ted  in to  process ing  terms, as 
they have been here.  C lear ly ,  ne i ther  
is  language spec i f i c ,  a l though the Word 
Order s t ra tegy  assumes the ex is tence  of  
a "bas ic"  or "normal"  word order ,  
usua l ly  assumed to be that  of  the 
s imple ,  dec la ra t ive ,  a f f i rmat ive  
sentence.  On qu i te  independent grounds,  
Givon 4 has argued that  the s imple ,  
dec la ra t ive ,  a f f i rmat ive  sentence type 
is  the most bas ic  in many, i f  not a l l ,  
languages prec ise ly  because i t  i s  
p resuppos i t iona l ly  the least  burdened 
type.  The Word Order s t ra tegy  pred ic ts  
that  any c lause  which dev ia tes  from the 
normal form wi l l  be more d i f f i cu l t  to 
process than one which does not .  The 
In ter rupt ion  s t ra tegy  pred ic ts  that  any 
sentence w i th  an in terna l ly  embedded 
( in ter rupt ing)  c lause  w i l l  be more 
d i f f i cu l t  to process than one w i th  an 
embedded c lause  at one ext remi ty  or the 
o ther ,  
Sheldon e noted that  the Adjacency 
s t ra tegy  i s  bas ica l ly  an Eng l i sh  pars ing  
dev ice  which app l ies  b l ind ly  across a 
sentence from le f t  to r ight ,  ass ign ing  a 
sur face  grammatical  ro le  to each fu l l  NP 
i t  encounters ,  and leav ing  re la t ive  
pronouns unanalyzed.  She po in ted  out 
that  the s t ra tegy  sometimes fa i l s  to 
ass ign  grammatical  ro les  cor rect ly .  For 
example, in  an SSa sentence l i ke  "The 
61 
man that  chased the dog saw the boy, 
the s t ra tegy  ass igns  The man as sub jec t  
of  chased and the doq as ob jec t .  I t  
then sk ips  over that  and incor rect ly  
ass igns  the doq as sub jec t  of  saw, and 
f ina \ ] \ ]y  spec i f ies  the boy as ob jec t .  
Thus, the Adjacency s t ra tegy  makes one 
er ror  for  type SSa. She\]don 9 suggests 
that  the number of  e r rors  made by the 
s t ra tegy  determines  the re la t ive  
process ing  d i f f i cu l ty  of  that  type of  
s t ruc ture .  
Each s t ra tegy  generates  pred ic t ions  
as to the ease of  p rocess ing  o f  the 
e ight  sentence types.  I f  both Deep and 
Surface vers ions  of  Para \ ] \ ]e l  Funct ion  
are tes ted ,  f i ve  sets  of  p red ic t ions  
fo l low.  These are l i s ted  in Table 1, 
where ">" s ign i f ies  " i s  eas ie r  to 
comprehend than" or " i s  more natura l  
than . "

The natura lness  data were analyzed 
on the Un ivers i ty  of  A lber ta ' s  Amdahl 
470V/5 computer,  us ing  a packaged 
(BMD:O8V) three-way ana lys i s  of  var iance  
program, w i th  the fac tors  of  sub jec ts ,  
syntact i c  type ( four  \ ]eve \ ]s :  SS, SO, OS, 
00),  and v__gQice (two 1eve\]s:  ac t ive  and 
pass ive) .  A l l  the main e f fec ts  were 
s ign i f i cant  (~<.01) ,  but more 
impor tant ly  the type by vo ice  
in teract ion  was a l so  h igh \ ]y  s ign i f i cant  
(F (3 ,51)=20.48 ,  E<.O01), w i th  the 
sentences conta in ing  act ive  re la t ive  
clauses judged significantly more 
natural than those containing passive 
relative clauses. Consequently, the two 
groups were analyzed separately. 
Planned comparisons were carried out on 
each group to determine which types 
within each group were judged to be 
significantly the more natural. Each of 
the five strategies was tested within 
the two groups. Within the group 
containing active relative clauses, the 
on ly  s ign i f i cant  fac tor  was 
In ter rupt ion ,  w i th  types OOa and OSa 
judged s ign i f i cant ly  more natura l  than 
SSa and SOa (F (3 ,119)=14,27 ,  ~<.001) .  
None of  the Uther s t ra teg ies  was 
operat ive  in  th i s  g roup .  
Wi th in  the group conta in ing  pass ive  
re la t ive  c lauses~ the on ly  s ign i f i cant  
fac tor  was Word Order.  The types OSp 
and SSp, which have a re la t ive  c lause  
word order  of  SVO,  were judged 
s ign i f i cant ly  eas ie r  than types SOp and 
OOp, which have re la t ive  c lause  word 
order  of  OSV (L (3 ,119)=64.60 ,  ~<.001) .  
These resu l ts  are a l l  summarized in

The Eng l i sh  Experiment 
In order  to tes t  the pred ic t ions ,  a 
s ing le  exper iment  was conducted us ing  as 
s t imu l i  56 sentences in wr i t ten  form, 
w i th  seven separate  tokens 
( rep l i ca t ions)  of  each of  the e ight  
types.  The lex ica l  i tems were var ied  
across a l l  the sentences.  The task of  
the sub jec ts ,  e ighteen  nat ive  speakers 
of  Eng l i sh ,  was to eva luate  each of  the 
sentences in  terms of  re la t ive  ease of  
comprehension or natura lness  on a 
n ine -po in t  sca le ,  w i th  "1" the most 
natura l  or eas ies t  to understand and "9" 
the leas t .  Subjects  were permi t ted  to  
work at the i r  own ra tes  and were urged 
to ignore  as far  as poss ib le  the actua l  
lex ica l  i tems, focus ing  the i r  a t tent ion

Interpretation 
The first question to address in 
interpreting these data is why those 
sentences containing passive relative 
c\]auses were judged significantly more 
complex and less natural than those 
containing active relat4ves. To unravel 
62 - 
th i s  complex i ssue,  i t  is  ins t ruct ive  to 
examine severa l  fac tors  assoc ia ted  w i th  
the act ive /pass ive  d i s t inc t ion .  Wi th in  
an act ive  c lause ,  the sub jec t  of  a 
t rans i t ive  ac t ion  verb i s  typ ica l ly ,  
a l though not a lways,  in terpretab le  as a 
semantic  agent,  wh i le  for  the pass ive ,  
i t  i s  cer ta in  that  the sub jec t  i s  not an 
agent.  In fac t ,  Givon 4 has suggested 
that  an impor tant  funct ion  of  the 
pass ive  const ruct ion  is  to p lace a 
non-agent  NP in to  sub jec t  pos i t ion .  A 
pass ive  c lause  there fore  dev ia tes  from 
the "normal" case of  sub jec t  as semant ic  
agent.  Consequent ly ,  wh i le  both ac t ive  
and pass ive  c lauses  can be character i zed  
as hav ing a sur face  SVO word order ,  the 
sub jec t  of  the pass ive  i s  non-agent ,  and 
the ob jec t  is  the ob jec t  of  the 
prepos i t ion  .b_~. 
Another impor tant  d i f fe rence  i s  
that  pass ives  are far  less  f requent  than 
act ives .  In d i scuss ing  text  counts  made 
over a broad spectrum of  genres,  Givon 4 
repor ted  that  some 90% of the 
a f f i rmat ive ,  dec la ra t ive  sentences were 
act ives ,  and on ly  10% were pass ives .  
Furthermore,  on ly  20% of  the la t te r  were 
" fu l l "  pass ives  w i th  over t  agent ive  b~ 
phrases ,  wh i le  80% were t runcated  
pass ives .  Accord ing ly ,  on ly  2% of  
a f f i rmat ive ,  dec la ra t ive  sentences are 
" fu l l "  pass ives .  Givon 4 suggested the 
spec ia l  d i scourse  proper t ies  and 
presuppos i t ions  assoc ia ted  w i th  the 
pass ive  might account for  the i r  low 
f requency .  For example, the sub jec t  o f  
a pass ive  c lause  i s  not a potent ia l  
agent,  but i s  more typ ica l ly  a semant ic  
pat ient .  However, the sub jec ts  of  
dec la ra t ive  sentences tend to conta in  
Given in fo rmat ion ,  w i th  the ob jec ts  more 
l i ke ly  to be New. This  fo l lows  from the 
Given-New s t ra tegy ,  2 accord ing  to which 
Given in fo rmat ion  normal ly  precedes New 
in  a sentence.  Some 90% of  the sub jec t  
NPs in ac t ive  sentences are de f in i te ,  
wh i le  93% of  the sub jec t  NPs of  pass ive  
sentences are de f in i te .  4 In genera l ,  
then,  the sub jec ts  of  both ac t ive  and 
pass ive  sentences tend to be de f in i te  
and Given. In ac t ive  sentences,  
however, on ly  about 56% of  the d i rec t  
ob jec t  NPs are de f in i te ,  and the d i rec t  
ob jec t  i s  fa r  more l i ke ly  to conta in  New 
in format ion  than is  the sub jec t .  
S imi la r ly ,  i f  there  i s  an over t  ob jec t  
(agent ive)  phrase in  a pass ive ,  i t  i s  
almost invar iab ly  New in format ion .  
Based on these observat ions ,  we can 
ext ract  the fo l low ing  genera l  fac ts  
concern ing  the d i s t inc t ion  between 
act ive  and pass ive  c lauses .  Act ives  are 
more f requent ,  have sub jec t  as anent ,  
and ob jec t  as pat ient ,  Furthermore,  the 
sub jec t  of an ac t ive  is  typ ica l ly  
de f in i te  and Given, wh i le  the ob jec t  is  
less  l i ke ly  to be de f in i te  and more 
l i ke ly  to be New in format ion ,  The 
pass ive ,  on the o ther  hand, has a 
de f in i te ,  non-agent ive ,  typ ica l ly  Given 
sub jec t  and i f  i t  has an ob jec t  at a l l ,  
the ob jec t  is  agent,  typ ica l ly  de f in i te ,  
and New. The d i f fe rences  are c lear ly  
s igna l led  by the word order  and 
morpho log ica l  fac tors  assoc ia ted  w i th  
the pass ive .  Consequent ly ,  i t  would 
appear that  the g loba l  character i s t i c  of  
vo ice  has assoc ia ted  w i th  i t  a host  of  
syntact i c ,  semant ic ,  and d iscourse  
proper t ies ,  w i th  the pass ive  being by 
far  the more "marked" and less  expected 
form. 
Once the two groups have been 
separated by vo ice ,  we can examine the 
fac tors  w i th in  each group which g ive  
r i se  to fu r ther  subgroup ings .  Wi th in  
the act ives ,  the In ter rupt ion  s t ra tegy  
separates  the four  groups in to  two, 
demonst ra t ing  that  comprehension i s  more 
d i f f i cu l t  when a re la t ive  c lause  
in ter rupts  the main c lause .  Wi th in  the 
pass ives ,  Word Order was the on ly  
s ign i f i cant  fac tor :  a pass ive  re la t ive  
c lause  w i th  SVO word order  was judged 
eas ie r  to comprehend than one w i th  an 
OSV word order .  In ter rupt ion  p layed no 
ro le  among the subgroup ings  of  the 
pass ives .  
The exper iment  demonstrated the 
importance of  In ter rupt ion  and Word 
Order,  wh i le  ne i ther  vers ion  of  Para l le l  
Funct ion  nor Adjacency emerged as 
s ign i f i cant .  However, the two operat ive  
s t ra teg ies  are not equa l ly  sa l ient ,  and 
in par t i cu la r ,  i t  appears that  
In ter rupt ion  i s  impor tant  on ly  for  the 
ac t ive  s t ructures ,  in  which the normal 
expectat ion  of  sub jec t  as agent is  met. 
For the non-normal (pass ive~ cases, Word 
Order i s  very  impor tant .  Consequent ly ,  
i t  appears that  Word Order must be 
sat i s f ied  before  In ter rupt ion  can be 
ca l led  in to  p lay .  
At th i s  po in t ,  something fu r ther  
must be sa id  about the consequences of  
the Given-New s t ra tegy  w i th in  re la t ive  
c lauses .  Since i t  has an antecedent ,  a 
re la t ive  pronoun typ ica l ly  represents  
Given in fo rmat ion .  Consequent ly ,  in a 
re . \ ]a t ive  c lause  w i th  the s t ructure  \[RP V 
NP\], the re la t ive  pronoun is  sub jec t  and 
i s  in the pos i t ion  assoc ia ted  w i th  Given 
in fo rmat ion .  For re la t ive  c lause  
s t ructures  of  the form \[RP NP V\], the 
re la t ive  pronoun is  again the f i r s t  NP 
in  the c lause ,  and sat i s f ies  the Given 
63 
pos i t ion .  Furthermore,  i t  is  jus t  th i s  
Given RP which can be success fu l ly  
de le ted .  However, the sub jec t  NP, which 
is  a l so  typ ica l ly  Given in fo rmat ion ,  now 
f inds  i t se l f  in the New pos i t ion ,  
accord ing  to the Given-New s t ra tegy .  
Consequent ly ,  th i s  type of re la t ive  
c lause  s t ructure ,  w i th  word order  OSV, 
might be expected to be somewhat less 
natura l  in terms of  the Given-New 
s t ra tegy ,  than the former,  w i th  the word 
order  SVO. No such significant 
d i f fe rence  was found in these data,  
a l though such a resu l t  was repor ted  by 
Lynkowsky, 6 who conducted a s imi la r  
exper iment ,  but used on ly  ac t ive  
re la t ive  c lauses .  In her exper iment ,  
there  was no dev ia t ion  from the 
expected,  normal case of  sub jec t  as 
potent ia l  agent,  and consequent ly  i t  
would be expected that  the dominant Word 
Order s t ra tegy  would be the f i r s t  
s t ra tegy  to be ca l led  in to  operat ion .  
Wi th in  the pass ive  group,  the i ssue 
is  somewhat more complex. The pass ive  
re la t ive  c lauses  can have one of  two 
forms, e i ther  \[RP be Ved by NP\], w i th  
the word order  of  SVO, or \[RP NP be Ved 
by \ ] ,  w i th  an OSV word order .  In both 
cases, the normal expectat ion  of  sub jec t  
as agent is  v io la ted .  The resu l ts  of  
the exper iment  ind icate  that  i t  i s  the 
former,  SVO,  pass ives  which are judged 
far  more natura l  than the la t te r ,  OSV 
s t ructures .  In terms of  the Given-New 
s t ra tegy ,  th i s  makes a great  deal of  
sense. In the SVO case, the re la t ive  
proqoun appears to be Given for  two 
reasons:  i t  i s  a sub jec t  and i t  is  a 
re la t ive  pronoun. The agent ive  NP 
ob jec t  is  p rec ise ly  where New 
in format ion  should be. In the OSV case, 
however, the re la t ive  pronoun should  be 
Given s ince  i t  is  a re la t ive  pronoun,  
but i t  should be New s ince  i t  is  the 
ob jec t  of  the prepos i t ion  ..~. 
Furthermore,  the sub jec t  NP is  in  the 
New pos i t ion ,  but as sub jec t  i t  should 
be Given. Consequent ly ,  the Given-New 
s t ra tegy  seems to be work ing  aga ins t  
i t se l f  in  the pass ive  re la t ive  c lauses  
w i th  OSV word order ,  
One f ina l  aspect of  the Given-New 
fac tor  must a l so  be ment ioned.  
Typ ica l ly ,  de f in i te  NPs are const rued  as 
Given in fo rmat ion .  In the s t imu l i  fo r  
the present  exper iment ,  however, a11 NPs 
were de f in i te .  I f  a re la t ive  c lause  i s  
formed on a de f in i te  NP, there  may be a 
tendency to view the re la t ive  c lause  as 
adding to the de f in i teness  or 
spec i f i c i ty  of  the NP, thereby making i t  
even more "G iven , "  regard less  of  where 
i t  i s  p laced in the sentence.  
Consequent ly ,  w i th in  the act ive  group,  
the Given-New s t ra tegy  might be viewed 
as a " fo rce  ''3 favor ing  s t ructures  w i th  
the re la t ive  c lauses  on the sub jec t  NP, 
wh i le  In ter rupt ion  would be a fo rce  
favor ing  s t ructures  w i th  re la t ive  
c lauses  on ob jec t  NPs. Accord ing ly ,  
these two forces  are in compet i t ion  
w i th in  the act ives .  In the pass ive  
group, however, the Word Order s t ra tegy  
favors  re la t ive  c lauses  of  the form SVO, 
and the Given-New s t ra tegy  a l so  favors  
such s t ructures .  Here, the two 
s t ra teg ies  work together .  
The Japanese Experiment 
At th i s  po in t ,  b r ie f  ment ion w i l l  
be made of  a Japanese exper iment  s imi la r  
to the one repor ted  above, but focus ing  
on ly  on act ive  re la t ive  c lauses ,  The 
same methodology was employed, w i th  24 
nat ive  speakers of  Japanese serv ing  as 
sub jec ts .  The s t imu l i  were twelve 
sentences,  w i th  three  rep l i ca t ions  of  
four  types.  Japanese is  an SOY 
language, and the re la t ive  c lause  
precedes the mod i f ied  NP. Furthermore,  
Japanese re la t ive  c lauses  do not conta in  
re la t ive  pronouns,  but ra ther  exh ib i t  
de le t ion  of  the re \ ]a t iv i zed  NP. The 
fo l low ing  four  s t ruc tures  were tes ted :

The data were analyzed on the 
Un ivers i ty  of  A lber ta ' s  Amdah\] 470V/6 
computer,  us ing  the BMD:O8V two-way 
ana lys i s  of  var iance  program wi th  
subject.s and types ( four  leve ls :  SS, SO, 
OS, 00) as fac tors .  The on ly

s ign i f i cant  fac tor  was type (~(3 ,69)= 
115.54, ~<,001) .  Planned comparisons 
were used to tes t  for  each of the 
s t ra teg ies  except for  the 
Eng l i sh -spec i f i c  Adjacency s t ra tegy .  
The f i r s t  comparison ind icated  that  
types SS and OS were s ign i f i cant ly  
eas ie r  and more natura l  than types SO 
and O0 (F (3 ,69)=318.27 ,  ~<.001) .  There 
was no sTgn i f i cant  d i f fe rence  between O0 
and SO, a l though type SS was 
s ign i f i cant ly  eas ie r  than OS 
(L (3 ,69)=28.25 ,  ~<.001) .  These resu l ts  
are represented  in  Table 3.

The fac tor  separat ing  the f i r s t  two 
types from the second pa i r  i s  c lear ly  
Word Order: sentences conta in ing  
re la t ive  c lauses  w i th  OV word order  are 
pre fer red  over those conta in ing  re la t ive  
c lauses  w i th  the SV word order .  
Moreover,  w i th in  the pa i r  conta in ing  OV 
re la t ive  c lauses ,  In ter rupt ion  
determined that  the non- in ter rupted  SS 
type was pre fer red  over the in ter rupted  
OS type.  Consequent ly ,  in dapanese, as 
in  Eng l i sh ,  the Word Order s t ra tegy  is  
the more impor tant  of  the two, w i th  
In ter rupt ion  on ly  ca l led  in to  operat ion  
when the normal word order  is  met, In 
her s tudy  of  the acqu is i t ion  of  compound 
and complex sentences in  dapanese, 
Kawashima 5 found that  le f t -b ranch ing  
s t ructures  were mastered before  those 
conta in ing  center  embeddings, thus 
suppor t ing  In ter rupt ion  as the major 
fac tor  in the acqu is i t ion  of  re la t ive  
c lauses .  
Only specu la t ion  can be o f fe red  as 
to why the OV word order  is  p re fer red  to 
the SV. dapanese, l i ke  Eng l i sh ,  appears 
to obey the Given-New s t ra tegy ,  but 
un l ike  Eng l i sh ;  Japanese permi ts  the 
omiss ion  of an "understood"  (e .g . ,  
Given) NP, making sentences w i thout  
over t  sub jec ts  qu i te  common. Wi th in  
re la t ive  c lauses ,  the Given, re la t iv i zed  
NP is  omi t ted .  But s ince  Given sub jec ts  
may a l so  be omi t ted ,  i t  fo l lows  that  the 
OV c lause  type would be more natura l  and 
common than the SV type when the verb is  
t rans i t ive .  In shor t ,  the Japanese data 
support  the c ross - l ingu is t i c  v iab i l i ty  
of  the Word Order, In ter rupt ion ,  and 
Given-New s t ra teg ies .  
Conc lus ions  
Or ig ina l ly ,  th i s  research  was 
undertaken in an attempt to sor t  out 
competing cogn i t ive  s t ra teg ies  re levant  
to the process ing  of  complex sentences 
w i th  re la t ive  c lauses .  That goal was 
ach ieved,  and the importance of both 
Word Order and In ter rupt ion  was 
demonstrated,  wh i le  both vers ions  of  
Para l le l  Funct ion  and Adjacency were 
re jec ted .  However, o ther  s t ra teg ies  
were a l so  found to be operab le .  The 
semant ic  s t ra tegy  which assoc ia tes  
sub jec t  w i th  agent is  in fac t  a vers ion  
of  Word Order.  In add i t ion ,  and perhaps 
most impor tant ly ,  the Given-New s t ra tegy  
was found to be of  extreme importance,  
both for  Eng l i sh  and for  Japanese. 
F ina l ly ,  a h ie rarchy  of  s t ra teg ies  has 
suggested i t se l f .  The Given-New 
s t ra tegy  is  obv ious ly  of  g reat  
importance for  sentences in  context ,  and 
a l though the s t imu l i  used in  the two 
s tud ies  repor ted  here were presented  in 
i so la t ion ,  the s t ra tegy  s t i l l  seems to 
be operat ive .  Fur thermore,  w i th in  a 
par t i cu la r  sentence,  i t  appears that  
Word Order c r i te r ia  must be sat i s f ied  
be fore  In ter rupt ion  is  employed. 
There are s t i l l  numerous loose ends 
to be invest igated .  The def in i teness  of  
NPs must be var ied  exper imenta l ly  to 
t ighten  up the tentat ive  suggest ions  
concern ing  the Givenness o f  de f in i te  
NPs; sentences must be care fu l ly  s tud ied  
in  contexts ;  text  counts  should be 
undertaken to es tab l i sh  the propor t ion  
of  re la t ive  c lauses  and the i r  pos i t ions ,  
in accordance w i th  such fac tors  as 
de f in i teness ,  In ter rupt ion ,  and the 
Given-New s t ra tegy .  The present  s tudy  
has on ly  sc ra tched the sur face ,  but at 
least  the resu l ts  are encourag ing in  
that  they accord we\]\]  across two very  
d i f fe rent  languages, p rov id ing  a s tar t  
on the problem of  the in teract ion  of
