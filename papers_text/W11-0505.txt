Abstract
We establish a novel task in the spirit of news sum-
marization and topic detection and tracking (TDT):
daily determination of the topics newly popular with
Wikipedia readers. Central to this effort is a new
public dataset consisting of the hourly page view
statistics of all Wikipedia articles over the last three
years. We give baseline results for the tasks of:
discovering individual pages of interest, clustering
these pages into coherent topics, and extracting the
most relevant summarizing sentence for the reader.
When compared to human judgements, our system
shows the viability of this task, and opens the door
to a range of exciting future work.
1 Introduction
In this paper we analyze a novel dataset: we have
collected the hourly page view statistics1 for every
Wikipedia page in every language for the last three years.
We show how these page view statistics, along with other
features like article text and inter-page hyperlinks, can
be used to identify and explain popular trends, including
popular films and music, sports championships, elections,
natural disasters, etc.
Our approach is to select a set of articles whose daily
pageviews for the last fifteen days dramatically increase
above those of the preceding fifteen day period. Rather
than simply selecting the most popular articles for a given
day, this selects articles whose popularity is rapidly in-
creasing. These popularity spikes tend to be due to sig-
nificant current events in the real world. We examine 100
such articles for each of 5 randomly selected days in 2009
and attempt to group the articles into clusters such that
the clusters coherently correspond to current events and
extract a summarizing sentence that best explains the rel-
evant event. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are pro-
vided along with the evaluation dataset.

viewed the pages. See http://dammit.lt/wikistats

Figure 1: Automatically selected articles for Jan 27, 2009.
We compare our automatically collected articles to
those in the daily current events portal of Wikipedia
where Wikipedia editors manually chronicle current
events, which comprise armed conflicts, international re-
lations, law and crime, natural disasters, social, political,
sports events, etc. Each event is summarized with a sim-
ple phrase or sentence that links to related articles. We
view our work as an automatic mechanism that could po-
tentially supplant this hand-curated method of selecting
current events by editors.
Figure 1 shows examples of automatically selected ar-
ticles for January 27, 2009. We would group the arti-
cles into 3 clusters, {Barack Obama, Joe Biden, White
House, Inauguration} which corresponds to the inaugu-
ration of Barack Obama, {US Airways Flight 1549, Ches-
ley Sullenburger, Hudson River} which corresponds to
the successful ditching of an airplane into the Hudson
river without loss of life, and {Superbowl, Arizona Car-
dinals} which corresponds to the then upcoming Super-
bowl XLIII.
We further try to explain the clusters by selecting sen-
tences from the articles. For the first cluster, a good se-
lection would be ?the inauguration of Barack Obama as
the 44th president . . . took place on January 20, 2009?.
For the second cluster, ?Chesley Burnett ?Sully? Sullen-
berger III (born January 23, 1951) is an American com-
33
mercial airline pilot, . . . , who successfully carried out the
emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on
the Hudson River, offshore from Manhattan, New York
City, on January 15, 2009, . . . ? would be a nice sum-
mary, which also provides links to the other articles in
the same cluster. For the third cluster, ?Superbowl XLIII
will feature the American Football Conference champion
Pittsburgh Steelers (14-4) and the National Football Con-
ference champion Arizona Cardinals (12-7) .? would be
a good choice which delineates the association with Ari-
zona Cardinals.
Different clustering methods and sentence selection
features are evaluated and results are compared. Topic
models, such as K-means (Manning et al, 2008) vector
space clustering and latent Dirichlet alocation (Blei et
al., 2003), are compared to clustering using Wikipedia?s
link structure. To select sentences we make use of NLP
technologies such as coreference resolution, and named
entity and date taggers. Note that the latest revision of
each article on the day on which the article is selected is
used in clustering and textualization to simulate the situa-
tion where article selection, clustering, and textualization
are performed once every day.
Figure 2 illustrates the pipeline of our WikiTopics sys-
tem: article selection, clustering, and textualization.
2 Article selection
We would like to identify an uptrend in popularity of ar-
ticles. In an online encyclopedia such as Wikipedia, the
pageviews for an article reflect its popularity. Following
the Trending Topics software2, WikiTopics?s articles se-
lection algorithm determines each articles? monthly trend
value as increase in pageviews within last 30 days. The
monthly trend value tk of an article k is defined as be-
low:
tk =
15?
i=1
dki ?
30?
i=16
dki
where
dki = daily pageviews i? 1 days ago for an article k
We selected 100 articles of the highest trend value for
each day in 2009. We call the articles WikiTopics articles.
We leave as future work other possibilities to determine
the trend value and choose articles3, and only briefly dis-
cuss some alternatives in this section.
Wikipedia has a portal page called ?current events?,
in which significant current events are listed manu-
ally by Wikipedia editors. Figure 3 illustrates spikes in

events, such as Twitter feeds, etc.

to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Pageviews spike on the

pageviews of the hand-curated articles related to the in-
auguration of Barack Obama, which shows clear correla-
tion between the spikes and the day on which the relevant
event took place. It is natural to contrast WikiTopics ar-
ticles to this set of hand-curated articles. We evaluated
WikiTopics articles against hand-curated articles as gold
standard and had negative results with precision of 0.13
and recall of 0.28.
There are a few reasons for this. First, there are
much fewer hand-curated articles than WikiTopics arti-
cles: 17,253 hand-selected articles vs 36,4004 WikiTopics
articles; so precision cannot be higher than 47%. Second,
many of the hand-selected articles turned out to have very
low pageviews: 6,294 articles (36.5%) have maximum
daily pageviews less than 1,000 whereas WikiTopics arti-
cles have increase in pageviews of at least 10,000. It is ex-
tremely hard to predict the hand-curated articles based on
pageviews. Figure 4 further illustrates hand-curated arti-
cles? lack of increase in pageviews as opposed to Wiki-
Topics articles. On the contrary, nearly half of the hand-
curated articles have decrease in pageviews. For the hand-
curated articles, it seems that spikes in pageviews are
an exception rather than a commonality. We therefore
concluded that it is futile to predict hand-curated arti-
cles based on pageviews. The hand-curated articles suffer
from low popularity and do not spike in pageviews often.
Figure 5 contrasts the WikiTopics articles and the hand-
curated articles. The WikiTopics articles shown here do
not appear in the hand-curated articles within fifteen days
before or after, and vice versa. WikiTopics selected arti-
cles about people who played a minor role in the relevant
event, recently released films, their protagonists, popular
TV series, etc. Wikipedia editors selected articles about

the relevant event and their event description mentions
all of them.
For this paper we introduce the problem of topic se-
lection along with a baseline solution. There are vari-
ous viable alternatives to the monthly trend value. As
one of them, we did some preliminary experiments with
the daily trend value, which is defined by dk1 ? d
k

the difference of the pageviews between the day and the
previous day: we found that articles selected using the
daily trend value have little overlap?less than half the ar-
ticles overlapped with the monthly trend value. Future
work will consider the addition of sources other than
pageviews, such as edit histories and Wikipedia category
information, along with more intelligent techniques to
combine these different sources.

current event. Clusters, in general, may have hierarchies
and an element may be a member of multiple clusters.
Whereas Wikipedia?s current events are hierarchically
compiled into different levels of events, we focus on flat
clustering, leaving hierarchical clustering as future work,
but allow multiple memberships.
In addition to clustering using Wikipedia?s inter-page
hyperlink structure, we experimented with two families
of clustering algorithms pertaining to topic models: the
K-means clustering vector space model and the latent
Dirichlet alocation (LDA) probabilistic topic model. We
used the Mallet software (McCallum, 2002) to run these
topic models. We retrieve the latest revision of each arti-
cle on the day that WikiTopics selected it. We strip unnec-
essary HTML tags and Wiki templates with mwlib5 and
split sentences with NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002). Nor-
malization, tokenization, and stop words removal were
performed, but no stemming was performed. The uni-
gram (bag-of-words) model was used and the number

of clusters/topics K was set to 50, which is the average
number of clusters in the human clusters6. For K-means,
the common settings were used: tf and tf-idf weighting
and cosine similarity (Allan et al, 2000). For LDA, we
chose the most probable topic for each article as the clus-
ter ID. Two different clustering schemes make use of the
inter-page hyperlink structure: ConComp and OneHop.
In these schemes, the link structure is treated as a graph,
in which each page corresponds to a vertex and each link
to an undirected edge. ConComp groups a set of arti-
cles that are connected together. OneHop chooses an ar-
ticle and groups a set of articles that are directly linked.
The number of resulting clusters depends on the order
in which you choose an article. To find the minimum or
maximum number of such clusters would be computa-
tionally expensive. Instead of attempting to find the op-
timal number of clusters, we take a greedy approach and
iteratively create clusters that maximize the central node
connectivity, stopping when all nodes are in at least one
cluster. This allows for singleton clusters.
Three annotators manually clustered WikiTopics arti-
cles for five randomly selected days. The three manual
clusters were evaluated against each other to measure
inter-annotator agreement, using the multiplicity B3 met-
ric (Amigo? et al, 2009). Table 1 shows the results. The
B3 metric is an extrinsic clustering evaluation metric and
needs a gold standard set of clusters to evaluate against.
The multiplicity B3 works nicely for overlapping clus-
ters: the metric does not need to match cluster IDs and
only considers the number of the clusters that a pair of
data points shares. For a pair of data points e and e?, let
C(e) be the set of the test clusters that e belongs to, and
L(e) be the set of e?s gold standard clusters. The multi-
6K=50 worked reasonably well for the most cases. We are planning
to explore a more principled way to set the number.

plicity B3 scores are evaluated as follows:
Prec(e, e?) =
min (|C(e) ? C(e?)|, |L(e) ? L(e?)|)
|C(e) ? C(e?)|
Recall(e, e?) =
min (|C(e) ? C(e?)|, |L(e) ? L(e?)|)
|L(e) ? L(e?)|
The overall B3 scores are evaluated as follows:
Prec = AvgeAvge?.C(e)?C(e?)6=0Prec(e, e
?)
Recall = AvgeAvge?.L(e)?L(e?)6=0Recall(e, e
?)
The inter-annotator agreement in the B3 scores are in the
range of 67%?74%. K-means clustering performs best,
achieving 79% precision compared to manual cluster-
ing. OneHop clustering using the link structure achieved
comparable performance. LDA performed significantly
worse, comparable to ConComp clustering.
Clustering the articles according to the relevance to re-
cent popularity is not trivial even for humans. In Wiki-
Topics articles for February 10, 2009, Journey (band) and
Bruce Springsteen may seem to be relevant to Grammy
Awards, but in fact they are relevant on this day because
they performed the halftime show at the Super Bowl. K-
means fails to recognize this and put them into the cluster
of Grammy Awards, while ConComp merged Grammy
Awards and Super Bowl into the same cluster. OneHop
kept the two clusters intact and benefited from putting
Bruce Springsteen into both the clusters. LDA cluster-
ing does not have such a benefit; its performance might
have suffered from our allowing only a single member-
ship for an article. Clustering using the link structure per-
forms comparably with other clustering algorithms with-
out using topic models. It is worth noting that there are
a few ?octopus? articles that have links to many articles.
The United States on January 27, 2009 was disastrous,
with its links to 58 articles, causing ConComp clustering
to group 89 articles into a single cluster. OneHop clus-
tering?s condition that groups only articles that are one
hop away alleviates the issue and it also benefited from
putting an article into multiple clusters.
36
To see if external source help better clustering, we ex-
plored the use of news articles. We included the news ar-
ticles that we crawled from various news websites into
the same vector space as the Wikipedia articles, and ran
K-means clustering with the same settings as before. For
each day, we experimented with news articles within dif-
ferent numbers of past days. The results did not show
significant improvement over clustering without external
news articles. This needs further investigation7.
4 Textualization
We would like to generate textual descriptions for the
clustered articles to explain why they are popular and
what current event they are relevant to. We started with
a two-step approach similar to multi-document extrac-
tive summarization approaches (Mckeown et al, 2005).
The first step is sentence selection; we extract the best
sentence that describes the relevant event for each arti-
cle. The second step is combining the selected sentences
of a cluster into a coherent summary. Here, we focus on
the first step of selecting a sentence and evaluate the se-
lected sentences. The selected sentences for each clus-
ter are then put together without modification, where the
quality of generated summary mainly depends on the ex-
tracted sentences at the first step. We consider each article
separately, using as features only information such as date
expressions and references to the topic of the article. Fu-
ture work will consider sentence extraction, aware of the
related articles in the same cluster, and better summariza-
tion techniques, such as sentence fusion or paraphrasing.
We preprocess the Wikipedia articles using the Serif
system (Boschee et al, 2005) for date tagging and coref-
erence resolution. The identified temporal expressions
are in various formats such as exact date (?February 12,
1809?), a season (?spring?), a month (?December 1808?),
a date without a specific year (?November 19?), and even
relative time (?now?, ?later that year?, ?The following
year?). Some examples are shown in Figure 7. The en-
tities mentioned in a given article are compiled into a list
and the mentions of each entity, including pronouns, are
linked to the entity as a coreference chain. Some exam-
ples are shown in Figure 9.
In our initial scheme, we picked the first sentence
of each article because the first sentence is usually an
overview of the topic of the article and often relevant to
the current event. For example, a person?s article often
has the first line with one?s recent achievement or death.
An article about an album or a film often begins with the
release date. We call this First.
7News articles tend to group with other news articles. We are cur-
rently experimenting with different filtering and parameters. Also note
that we only experimented with all news articles on a given day. Clus-
tering with selective news articles might help.

Figure 7: Selected examples of temporal expressions identified
by Serif from 247 such date and time expressions extracted from
the article Abraham Lincoln.
We also picked the sentence with the most recent date
to the day on which the article was selected. Dates in the
near future are considered in the same way as the recent
dates. Dates may appear in various formats, so we make a
more specific format take precedence, i.e. ?February 20,
2009? is selected over vaguer dates such as ?February
2009? or ?2009?. We call this scheme Recent.
As the third scheme, we picked the sentence with the
most recent date among those with a reference to the ar-
ticle?s title. The reasoning behind this is if the sentence
refers to the title of the article, it is more likely to be rel-
evant to the current event. We call this scheme Self.
After selecting a sentence for each cluster, we substi-
tute personal pronouns in the sentence with their proper
names. This step enhances readability of the sentence,
which often refers to people by a pronoun such as ?he?,
?his?, ?she?, or ?her?. The examples of substituted proper
names appear in Figure 9 in bold. The Serif system classi-
fies which entity mentions are proper names for the same
person, but choosing the best name among the names is
not a trivial task: proper names may vary from John to
John Kennedy to John Fitzgerald ?Jack? Kennedy. We
choose the most frequent proper name.
For fifty randomly chosen articles over the five se-
lected days, two annotators selected the sentences that
best describes why an article gained popularity recently,
among 289 sentences per each article on average from
the article text. For each article, annotators picked a sin-
gle best sentence, and possibly multiple alternative sen-
tences. If there is no such single sentence that best de-
scribes a relevant event, annotators marked none as the
best sentence and listed alternative sentences that par-
tially explain the relevant event. The evaluation results
for all the selection schemes are shown in Table 2. To
see inter-annotator agreement, two annotators? selections
were evaluated against each other. The other selection
schemes are evaluated against both the two annotators?
selection and their scores in the table are averaged across
the two. The precision and recall score for best sentences
are determined by evaluating a scheme?s selection of the

often fails to relate the current event. Recent tend to pinpoint the
exact sentence that describes the relevant current event, but fails
when there are several sentences with a recent temporal expres-
sion. Self helps avoid sentences that does not refer to the topic
of the article, but suffers from errors propagated from corefer-
ence resolution.

best sentences against a gold standard?s selection. To
evaluate alternative sentences, precision is measured as
the fraction of articles where the test and gold standard
selections overlap (share at least one sentence), compared
to the total number of articles that have at least one sen-
tence selected according to the test set. Recall is defined
by instead dividing by the number of articles that have at
least one sentence selected in the gold standard.
The low inter-annotator agreement for selecting the
best sentence shows the difficulty of the task. However,
when their sentence selection is evaluated by allowing
multiple alternative gold standard sentences, the agree-
ment is higher. It seems that there are a set of articles for
which it is easy to pick the best sentence that two anno-
tators and automatic selection schemes easily agree on,
and another set of articles for which it is difficult to find
such a sentence. In the easier articles, the best sentence
often includes a recent date expression, which is easily
picked up by the Recent scheme. Figure 8 illustrates such
cases. In the more difficult articles, there are no such sen-
tences with recent dates. X2 (film) is such an example; it
was released in 2003. The release of the prequel X-Men
Origins: Wolverine in 2009 renewed its popularity and
the X2 (film) article still does not have any recent dates.
There is a more subtle case: the article Farrah Fawcett
includes many sentences with recent dates in a section,
which describes the development of a recent event. It is
hard to pinpoint the best one among them.
Sentence selection heavily depends on other NLP com-
ponents, so errors in them could result in the error in sen-
tence selection. Serena Williams is an example where an
error in sentence splitting propagates to sentence selec-
tion. The best sentence manually selected was the first
sentence in the article ?Serena Jameka Williams . . . , as of
February 2, 2009, is ranked World No. 1 by the Women?s
Tennis Association . . . .? The sentence was disastrously
divided into two sentences right after ?No.? by NLTK
during preprocessing. In other words, the gold standard
sentence could not be selected no matter how well se-
lection performs. Another source of error propagation is
coreference resolution. The Self scheme limits sentence
selection to the sentences with a reference to the articles?
title, and it failed to improve over Recent. In qualitative
analysis, 3 out of 4 cases that made a worse choice re-
sulted from failing to recognize a reference to the topic
of the article. By having it fall back to Recent?s selection
when it failed to find any best sentence, its performance
marginally improved. Improvements of the components
would result in better performance of sentence selection.
WikiTopics?s current sentence extraction succeeded in
generating the best or alternative sentences that summa-
rizes the relevant current event for more than half of the
articles, in enhanced readability through coreference res-
olution. For the other difficult cases, it needs to take dif-
ferent strategies rather than looking for the most recent
date expressions. Alternatives may consider references to
other related articles. In future work, selected sentences
will be combined to create summary of a current event,
and will use sentence compression, fusion and paraphras-
ing to create more succinct summaries.
5 Related work
WikiTopics?s pipeline architecture resembles that of news
summarization systems such as Columbia Newsblaster
(McKeown et al, 2002). Newsblaster?s pipeline is com-
prised of components for performing web crawls, article
text extraction, clustering, classification, summarization,
and web page generation. The system processes a con-
stant stream of newswire documents. In contrast, Wiki-
Topics analyzes a static set of articles. Hierarchical clus-
tering like three-level clustering of Newsblaster (Hatzi-
vassiloglou et al, 2000) could be applied to WikiTopics
to organize current events hierarchically. Summarizing
multiple sentences that are extracted from the articles in
the same cluster would provide a comprehensive descrip-
tion about the current event. Integer linear programming-
based models (Woodsend and Lapata, 2010) may prove to
be useful to generate summaries while global constraints
like length, grammar, and coverage are met.
The problem of Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT)
is to identify and follow new events in newswire, and
to detect the first story about a new event (Allan et al,
1998). Allan et al (2000) evaluated a variety of vector
space clustering schemes, where the best settings from
those experiments were then used in our work. This was
followed recently by Petrovic? et al (2010), who took an
approximate approach to first story detection, as applied
to Twitter in an on-line streaming setting. Such a system
might provide additional information to WikiTopics by
helping to identify and describe current events that have
yet to be explicitly described in a Wikipedia article. Svore
et al (2007) explored enhancing single-document sum-
mariation using news query logs, which may also be ap-
plicable to WikiTopics.
Wikipedia?s inter-article links have been utilized to
39
construct a topic ontology (Syed et al, 2008), word seg-
mentation corpora (Gabay et al, 2008), or to compute
semantic relatedness (Milne and Witten, 2008). In our
work, we found the link structure to be as useful to cluster
topically related articles as well as the article text. In fu-
ture work, the text and the link structure will be combined
as Chaudhuri et al (2009) explored multi-view hierarchi-
cal clustering for Wikipedia articles.
6 Conclusions
We have described a pipeline for article selection, clus-
tering, and textualization in order to identify and describe
significant current events as according to Wikipedia con-
tent, and metadata. Similarly to Wikipedia editors main-
taining that site?s ?current events? pages, we are con-
cerned with neatly collecting articles of daily relevance,
only automatically, and more in line with expressed user
interest (through the use of regularly updated page view
logs). We have suggested that Wikipedia?s hand-curated
articles cannot be predicted solely based on pageviews.
Clustering methods based on topic models and inter-
article link structure are shown to be useful to group
a set of articles that are coherently related to a current
event. Clustering based on only link structure achieved
comparable performance with clustering based on topic
models. In a third of cases, the sentence that best de-
scribed a current event could be extracted from the ar-
ticle text based on temporal expressions within an article.
We employed a coreference resolution system assist in
text generation, for improved readability. As future work,
sentence compression, fusion, and paraphrasing could be
applied to selected sentences with various strategies to
more succinctly summarize the current events. Our ap-
proach is language independent, and may be applied to
multi-lingual current event detection, exploiting further
the online encyclopedia?s cross-language references. Fi-
nally, we plan to leverage social media such as Twit-
ter as an additional signal, especially in cases where es-
sential descriptive information has yet to be added to a
Wikipedia article of interest.
