We propose a model of  language use that  i s  der ived  from 
wlewl~ language process ing  systems as knowledge-based sys -  
tems. The knowledge that  needs to  be represented  and organ ized  
here  i s  the la rge  amount of  knowledge about what the u t te ran-  
ces of a language mean. In this paper, I describe some of the 
theoretleel underp inn i~e of the model, and then desorlbe two 
programs, PHRAN and I~RED, that  are  based on these  ideas?  We 
have conducted a number of  exper iments  wi th  these  systems 
that  have some bear ing  on the u t i l i ty  of  the  model "s presumpt-  
ions ,  inc lud ing  tes t ing  these  systems on o ther  languages (Spa-  
h i sh  and Ch inese) ,  and implement ing one of  them in  a re la t ion -  
a l  data  base system.  
2 .0 .  The assumptions o f  the model 
2?1? The Importance of  Non-generat ive  Lan~age 
Language user  knows a great  number o f  fac t  about what 
u t te rances  o f  the i r  language mean. That i s ,  in  add i t ion  to 
knowing the meanings o f  a la rge  number of  words, they know the  
steaL%license of  a se t  of  mean ingfu l  ingu /s t to  un i t s  that  are  
not  necessar i l y  understood in  term8 of  the i~ components. Our 
con jec ture  i s  that  such un i t s  const i tu te  a very  cons iderab le  
f rac t ion  o f  the language knowledge needed by an in te l l igent  
language processor.

2.2 .  3harab le  Knowledge Base 
In  our  model, i t  i s  assumed that  the knowledge used 
fo r  analysis and fo r  product ion  is by and laxge the same. 
That i s ,  there  i s  on ly  one data  base of knowledge about the 
meanings of a language 's  forms. By having the knowledge of 
the two components be a shared data  base, on ly  one form of 
representat ion  i s  needed. Moreover, the add i t ion  of new know- 
ledge to thAs data  base extends the capab i l i t i es  of both sys -  
tems s imul taneous ly .  
As thAs requi rement  forces  knowledge to be represented  
deo lara t ive ly ,  the o ther  benef i t s  of such representat ions  eme 
en joyed  as we l l .  For exsunple, in  th i s  format,  knowledge about 
the language i s  kept separate  from the process ing  s t ra teg ies  
that  apply th i s  knowledge to the unders tand ing  and product ion  
tasks .  Thuue adding new knowledge requ i res  only adding new 
assszt ionB to the data  base,  not wr i t ing  and debug~ new 
code. In  add i t ion ,  o ther  knowledge bes ides  the mesu~ng of a 
phrase can be eas i ly  assoc ia ted  wi th  such dec la ra t ive  repres -  
entat ions .  
3 .0 .  PHRAN and P~h~ED 
We have been deve lop ing  th i s  model of language use in  
two re la ted  programs, PHRAN (PHRasal ANs~yzer) and PHRED 
(PHRasal ~ngllsh Diction). PHRAN is a language understanding 
program wr i t ten  by ? iga l  Arens.  I t  reads Eng l i sh  sentences  
and produces representat ions  from them that  encode the i r  
meaning.  PHRED is a natura l  language product ion  meohanAs~, 
developed by Steven Upst i l l .  PHRED takes meaning representat -  
ions  as input  and expresses them i~ ~ng l i sh  sentences .  
Both PHRAN and PHRED shs~e a common data  base of lang-  
uage knowledge. This data  base conta ins  dec la ra t ive  represent -  
a t ions  about what the phrase of the Eng l i sh  language mean. 
This knowledge i s  s to red  in  the form of p attex~-conoeDt pears .  
A pat tern  i s  a phrasa l  const ruct  of vary ing  de~rees of spec i -  
f i c i ty .  The concept par t  of a pat tern -concept  pa i r  i s  a ogn- 
- 297 - 
ceptua l  template  that  represents  the  meaning of  the  assoc ia t -  
ed phrase .  Together ,  these  pa i rs  assoc ia te  d i f fe rent  forms of  
u t te rances  w i th  the i r  mean ings ,  
PHRAN unders tands  by read ing  the  input  text  and t ry ing  
to  f ind  the  phrasa l  pat terns  that  app ly  to  i t .  Eventua l ly ,  the  
conceptua l  template  assoc ia ted  w i th  the  des i red  pat tern  i s  
used to  generate  the  s t ructure  denot ing  the  meaning of  the  
u t terance .  PHRED produces  sentences  that  encode an idea  by 
examin ing  the  same knowledge base .  
4 .0  Spanish and Chinese PHRAN 
We have build both a Spanish and a Chinese version of 
PHRAN s imply  by chans ing  the  pat tern -concept  data  base.  These 
programs lend  suppor t  to  some of  the  c la ims  we make fo r  our  
model .  We found that  i t  was poss ib le  to  rewr i te  most o f  the  
pat terns  in to  phrases  of  another  language w i thout  hav insgthe  
knowledge encoder  learn  anyth ing  about  the  inner  work ings  of  
the  program. Th is  suggests  that  a system l i ke  PHR~ cou ld  be 
des igned to  a l low fa i r ly  easy  const ruct ion  of  a language pro -  
cessor  fo r  a new language,  o r  to  a l low fo r  the  add i t ion  of  
spec ia l  purpose phrases  or  Ja rgon  by some user  who was not  an 
expert AI programmer. 
5.0 AI and Relation Data Bases 
We implemented a version of PHRAR in a conventional da- 
ta base system. PItR.kN was re-written in EQEEL, a query langua- 
ge for the INGRES relational data base system developed at 
Berke ley .  Tes ts  were run  to  compare the  re la t ive  per foremnce 
of  the  systems on var ious  s i ze  data  bases .  
The resu l t s  can be summarized as fo l lows :  The LISP 
vers ion  i s  cons iderab ly  fas ter  when the  data  base  of  pat tern -  
- concept  pa i rs  i s  smal l .  However, when the  data  base i s  la rge  
(2000 words and 500 patterns), the EQUEL version is about 3 
times faster than the LISP version. Thus performance problems 
in natural lan~Aag@ may be solved by importing developments in 
data  base techno logy  as  the  s i ze  of  our  knowledge bases  grow.
