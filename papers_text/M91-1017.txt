INTRODUCTIO N
The Unisys MUC-3 system is based on a three-tiered approach to text processing in which a novel an d
quite powerful knowledge-based form of information retrieval plays a central role . The main components
of this approach are as follows :
A Keyword-Based Information Retrieval Component .
This component predicts the occurrence of types of events in texts based on the presenc e
of key words and phrases .
A Knowledge-Based Information Retrieval Component .
This component, called KBIRD in the Unisys MUC-3 system, performs the followin g
tasks :
? Based on the co-occurrence of the predictions made by the keyword-based analysi s
component and expressions and concepts discovered in a given text, it predicts th e
likely occurrence of additional event types .
? It locates instances of predicted event types in texts .
? It identifies possible slot values for located instances of events .
[A Linguistic Analysis Component . ]
Although a natural language processing component was included in the design of the
Unisys MUC-3 system as a third level of text analysis, not enough time was availabl e
during the MUC-3 development cycle both to develop a knowledge-based information
retrieval component and to port the Unisys Pundit text-processing system to the MUC -
3 terrorist domain . A decision was made to focus on developing the knowledge-base d
information retrieval component and postpone the integration of Pundit until MUC-4 .
A Template Generation Component .
An application-specific Prolog program was written to merge templates describing the
same event, and to select the most likely slot values for templates in cases where multiple
slot values were proposed .
The Unisys MUC-3 development effort was comprised of two full-time Unisys staff members and on e
government employee on industrial rotation . A total of 2650 person-hours were put into the project, 80 0
of which were contributed by the government employee . The effort was partially supported by a DARP A
grant, which covered approximately 30% of the development cost .' The bulk of the effort involved the
development of the KBIRD system and its MUC-3 rule base . These two tasks took approximately the
same amount of time, and in total comprised roughly 85% of the effort .
'Work on this project was partially supported by Darpa under contract MDA-903-89-C-0041 .

Figure 1: Unisys MUC-3 System Scores
TEST RESULT S
The scores reported for the Unisys MUC-3 system are shown in Figure 1 . The low ACT and high MI S
scores reported for the template id slot indicate that event detection was a problem . 2 Poor event detectio n
performance explains the relatively low recall scores reported for all but the MATCHED ONLY summary
measurement . The MATCHED ONLY recall score is a measure of performance in which spurious (fals e
positive) and missing (false negative) templates are not factored in . The extremely low SPU score reported
for the template id slot suggests that further training of the rule base to improve event detection will no t
come at the expense of lower precision scores . In Figure 2, the performance of the Unisys system wit h
respect to other MUC-3 systems is indicated in two scatter plots .
Since template slot-filling algorithms are triggered by the detection of an event, poor event detectio n
performance has a direct negative impact on slot-filling performance . The recall scores for the Unisys
MUC-3 system reflect this fact . However, for five slots precision scores are also low . These low precisio n
scores are not a consequence of poor event detection, but result instead from a combination of poorl y
trained inference rules used to extract the sort of information expressed in the pertinent slots, and bug s
in the template generation routines that gather and merge correctly detected information into templat e
structures .
ANALYSIS
Contrary to what the low recall scores that have been reported suggest, the Unisys MUC-3 system ca n
perform well at predicting events . The keyword-based prediction of event types is very robust ; the databas e
used during this stage of processing was derived from the full 1300 message DEV corpus . Moreover, when
the rules used by KBIRD are properly trained, they do a very good job of locating instances of th e
events predicted by keyword analysis . Unfortunately, the KBIRD locator rules used to detect instance s
of events were trained on a relatively small set of messages?the 200 NOSC DEV and TST1 messages .
Consequently, even though the keyword-based analysis phase may have correctly predicted the likel y
occurrence of a given event type, KBIRD may not have been able to locate an instance of the predicte d
event type . Thus, KBIRD 's locator rules had a negating influence on the performance of the keyword -
based analysis phase . Prior to the final MUC-3 test, versions of the Unisys system with fewer, mor e
2 The template id slot is scored differently from other slots?the values reported for this slot are a measure of even t
detection performance (it doesn ' t make sense to report system performance in generating template ids, since the order i n
which templates are generated is not relevant in this task) [2]

Figure 2: The scatter plot on the left indicates the relative performance of the Unisys MUC-3 system withou t
taking into consideration false negative and false positive hits (the MATCHED-ONLY score) . The scatter plo t
on the right indicates the relative performance of the Unisys MUC-3 system when taking into consideratio n
both false negative and false positive hits (the ALL-TEMPLATES score) .
general event detection rules in place had recall scores ranging in the high 30's and low 40's for all th e
summary measures . A tactical mistake was made in attempting to replace this general rule base with a
larger, more context-sensitive one, since there was not enough time to allow the larger rule base to be
properly trained . In the evaluation, generating spurious templates tended to have much less of an impac t
on scores than failing to generate templates at all . In future evaluations, we will investigate the use o f
different locator rule sets as a settable system parameter .
Rule training was hindered during the MUC-3 development cycle by the need to concurrently build the
component that would be using the rules . In addition to this development problem, technical difficulties
in KBIRD's design began to appear once the number of rules had grown to a realistic size . These technical
problems resulted in slow message processing speeds, which further complicated the rule training process .
The following three key problems were identified :
Heavy use of forward-chaining .
There is currently too much reliance on forward-chaining in the KBIRD system . Many
KBIRD reasoning tasks could be more efficiently achieved in a backward-chaining fashion .
Expensive TMS system .
KBIRD was built on top of a very general inferencing mechanism with an expensiv e
TMS system. KBIRD's needs for truth maintenance could be accomodated using a much
simpler TMS component .
Inability to focus search .
In KBIRD, it is currently not possible to focus search on a specific region of text . The
mechanism used to satisfy a rule looks for all chart elements (concepts, words, phrases ,
and so forth) that match constituent expressions in the antecedent of a rule . If the KBIRD
rule specifies that an element of a certain type must be in the same sentence as some other
element, it would be more efficient to limit the search space to just those chart element s
that fall within the span of the sentence. However, KBIRD's algorithm currently searche s
through chart elements indexed to locations anywhere in the text for suitable candidates .

CONCLUDING REMARK S
The time constraints imposed in MUC-3 made it impossible to fully develop the Unisys MUC-3 system' s
knowledge-based information retrieval component, KBIRD, before the evaluation deadline . Consequently ,
it is not possible at this time to establish the capabilities of the three-tiered approach realized in th e
system. The system's scores indicate, however, that although the rules for locating instances of event s
were inadequately trained, its performance at identifying slot values once an instance has been found i s
quite good .
Future work on the system will solve the technical problems that have been observed . This will b e
achieved by performing the following tasks :
? The overall system flow will be restructured to allow backward-chaining to handle more of the
processing load .
? The current forward-chaining mechanism will be reimplemented so that it is specifically geared t o
the processing tasks envisoned for KBIRD .
? Subject to an appropriate funding source, the KBIRD locator rules used to detect instances o f
predicted event types will be properly trained .
In addition to solving the technical problems that have arisen in the system's KBIRD component, a
major effort will be made to incorporate the Unisys Pundit NLP system into the MUC-3 system .
