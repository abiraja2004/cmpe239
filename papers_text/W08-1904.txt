Abstract 
ProPOSEL is a prosody and PoS English lexicon, 
purpose-built to integrate and leverage domain 
knowledge from several well-established lexical 
resources for machine learning and NLP applica-
tions. The lexicon of 104049 separate entries is 
in accessible text file format, is human and ma-
chine-readable, and is intended for open source 
distribution with the Natural Language ToolKit. 
It is therefore supported by Python software tools 
which transform ProPOSEL into a Python dic-
tionary or associative array of linguistic concepts 
mapped to compound lookup keys. Users can 
also conduct searches on a subset of the lexicon 
and access entries by word class, phonetic tran-
scription, syllable count and lexical stress pat-
tern. ProPOSEL caters for a range of different 
cognitive aspects of the lexicon?.   
1 Introduction  
ProPOSEL (Brierley and Atwell, 2008) is a pros-
ody and part-of-speech (PoS) English lexicon 
which merges information from respected elec-
tronic dictionaries and databases, and which is 
purpose-built for linkage with corpora; for popu-
lating tokenized corpus text with a priori linguis-
tic knowledge; for machine learning tasks which 
involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text; 
and for open source distribution with NLTK - the 
Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et 
al, 2007a).

A pronunciation lexicon like ProPOSEL is an 
integral part of the front-end natural language 
processing (NLP) module in a generic text-to-
speech (TTS) synthesis system and constitutes a 
natural way of giving such a system phonetic, 
prosodic and morpho-syntactic insights into input 
text. For English, three such resources, originally 
developed for automatic speech recognition  
(ASR) and listing words and their phonetic tran-
scriptions, are widely used: CELEX-2 (Baayen et 
al, 1996); PRONLEX (Kingsbury et al 1997); 
and CMU, the Carnegie-Mellon Pronouncing 
Dictionary (Carnegie-Mellon University, 1998). 
The latter is used in Edinburgh?s state of the art 
Festival speech synthesis system (Black et al 
1999) and is included as one of the datasets in 
NLTK. 
The starting point for ProPOSEL is CUVPlus1 
(Pedler, 2002), a computer-usable and human-
readable dictionary of inflected forms which 
uniquely identifies word class for each entry via 
C5 PoS tags, the syntactic annotation scheme 
used in the BNC or British National Corpus 
(Burnard, 2000). CUVPlus is an updated version 
of CUV2 (Mitton, 1992), an electronic dictionary 
in accessible text file format which in turn de-
rives from the traditional paper-based Oxford 
Advanced Learner?s Dictionary of Current Eng-
lish (Hornby, 1974). 
Recently, lexica for thirteen world lan-
guages, including US-English, have been 
created via the European-funded LC-STAR 
project (Hartinkainen et al 2003) to address the 
shortage of language resources in the form of 
wide coverage lexica with detailed morpho-
syntactic information that meet the needs of 
ASR, TTS and speech-to-speech translation 
(SST) applications. The incorporation of C5 PoS-
tags in CUVPlus provides this kind of detail and

distinguishes this lexicon from other paper-based 
and electronic English dictionaries, including 
CELEX-2, PRONLEX and CMU; it also facili-
tates linkage with machine-readable corpora like 
the BNC.  
However, CUVPlus entries compact PoS vari-
ants for a given word form into a single field as 
in the following example where burning is classi-
fied as an adjective, a present participle and a 
noun in Table 1: 
 
burning|AJ0:14,VVG:14,NN1:2| 
Table 1: Sample from CUVPlus record structure 
showing PoS variants for the word form burning 
 
An early operation during ProPOSEL build was 
therefore to introduce one-to-one mappings of 
word form to word class, as defined by C5, to 
facilitate their use as compound lookup keys 
when the lexicon is transformed into a Python 
dictionary or associative array (?4). 
2 ProPOSEL: a repository of phonetic, 
syntactic and prosodic concepts  
The current revised version of ProPOSEL2 is a 
text file of 104049 separate entries, each com-
prising 15 pipe-separated fields arranged as fol-
lows: 
(1) word form; (2) BNC C5 tag; (3) CUV2 capi-
talisation flag alert for word forms which start 
with a capital letter; (4) SAM-PA phonetic tran-
scription; (5) CUV2 tag and frequency rating; (6) 
C5 tag and BNC frequency rating; (7) syllable 
count; (8) lexical stress pattern; (9) Penn Tree-
bank tag(s); (10) default content or function word 
tag; (11) LOB tag(s); (12) C7 tag(s); (13) DISC 
stressed and syllabified phonetic transcription; 
(14) stressed and unstressed values mapped to 
DISC syllable transcriptions; (15) consonant-
vowel [CV] pattern.

 April 2008 
(2002) and Mitton (1992). A full account of Pro-
POSEL build is planned for a subsequent paper, 
where phonology fields in source lexica (CU-
VPlus, CELEX-2 and CMU) and new phonology 
fields in the prosody and PoS English lexicon 
will be discussed in detail. The rationale for 
fields displaying syllable count, lexical stress 
pattern and CFP status is summarised here in 
section 3. 
Four major PoS tagging schemes have been 
included in ProPOSEL to facilitate linkage with 
several widely used speech corpora: C5 (field 2) 
with the BNC as mentioned; Penn Treebank 
(field 9) with Treebank-3 (Marcus et al 1999); 
LOB (Johansson et al 1986) (field 11) with 
MARSEC (Roach et al 1993); and C7 (field 12) 
with the 2 million-word BNC Sampler Corpus. 
The lookup mechanism described in section 4 
where a match is sought between (token, tag) 
tuples in incoming corpus text and ProPOSEL?s 
compound dictionary keys, also in the form of 
(token, tag) tuples, is possible for all four syntac-
tic annotation schemes represented in the lexi-
con.  
3 Accessing the lexicon through sound, 
syllables and rhythmic structure  
One field of particular significance for Pro-
POSEL?s target application of prosodic phrase 
break prediction (?3) is field (8) for lexical stress 
patterns, symbolic representations of the rhyth-
mic structure of word forms via a string of num-
bers. Thus the pattern for the word form 
,objec?tivity - with secondary stress on the first 
syllable and primary stress on the third syllable - 
is 20100. For some homographs, this lexical 
stress pattern can fluctuate depending on part-of-
speech category and meaning. The wordform 
present is a case in point, as demonstrated by 
fields 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 for all its entries in 
ProPOSEL shown in Table 3: 
present | AJ0 | ?preznt | 2 | 10 | C | 
present | NN1 | ?preznt | 2 | 10 | C | 
present | VVI | prI?zent | 2 | 01 | C | 
present | VVB | prI?zent | 2 | 01 | C | 
Table 3: Rhythmic structure for the homograph 
present is inverted when it functions as a verb 
 
Two well established phonetic transcription 
schemes are also represented in ProPOSEL: the 
original SAM-PA transcriptions in field 4 and 
DISC stressed and syllabified transcriptions in 
fields 13 and 14 which, unlike SAM-PA and the 
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), use a sin-
gle character to represent dipthongs: /p8R/ for 
pair, for example. 
26
 Phonology fields in ProPOSEL constitute a range 
of access routes for users. As an illustration, a 
search for like candidates to the verb obliterate 
might focus on structure and sound: verbs of 4 
syllables (fields 2 and 7), with vowel reduction 
on the first syllable (fields 8 or 14), and primary 
stress on the second syllable (again, a choice of 
fields as users may wish to use the SAM-PA 
phonetic transcriptions). This filter retrieves 
sixty-seven candidates - most but not all of them 
end in /eIt/ - and includes one oddity among 
the examples in Table 4. Further examples of live 
filtered searches are presented in section 5. 
Table 4: Sample of 8 candidate verbs retrieved 
which share requested phonological features with 
the template verb: obliterate  
 
4 ProPOSEL: domain knowledge for 
machine learning  
As previously stated, the rationale for ProPOSEL 
was to integrate information from different dic-
tionaries and databases into one lexicon, custom-
ised for language engineering tasks which in-
volve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text. 
One such task is automated phrase break predic-
tion: the classification of junctures (whitespaces) 
between words in the input text as either breaks 
(the minority class) or non-breaks. Typically, the 
machine learner is trained on PoS-tagged and 
boundary-annotated text - the speech corpus or 
gold standard - and then tested on an unseen ref-
erence dataset, minus the boundary tags, from the 
same corpus. Finally, it is evaluated by counting 
how many of the original boundary locations 
have been recaptured or predicted by the model.   
Phrase break classifiers have been trained on 
additional text-based features besides PoS tags. 
The CFP status of a token - is it a content word 
(e.g. nouns or adjectives) or function word (e.g. 
prepositions or articles) or punctuation mark? - 
has proved to be a very effective attribute in both 
deterministic and probabilistic models (Liberman 
and Church, 1992; Busser et al 2001) and there-
fore, a default content-word/function-word tag is 
assigned to each entry in ProPOSEL in field (10). 
It is anticipated that further research will suggest 
modifications to this default status when the CFP 
attribute interacts with other text-based features. 
Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have 
already been used successfully in phrase break 
models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002). 
However, they assume uniformity in terms of 
duration of syllables whereas we know that in 
connected speech, an indefinite number of un-
stressed syllables are packed into the gap be-
tween one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and an-
other, English being a stress-timed language. A 
lexical stress pattern, where syllables are 
weighted 0, 1 or 2, has therefore been included in 
fields (8) and (14) for entries in ProPOSEL be-
cause of its potential as a classificatory feature in 
the machine learning task of phrase break predic-
tion.   
The thematic programme for PASCAL 3  in 
2008 focuses on approaches to supplementing 
raw training data (e.g. the speech corpus) with a 
priori knowledge (e.g. the lexicon) to improve 
performance in machine learning. The prosody-
syntax interface is notoriously complex. Planned 
research into the phrase break prediction task 
will attempt to incorporate a dictionary-derived 
feature such as lexical stress (field 8 in Pro-
POSEL) into a data-driven model to explore this 
interface more fully. 
5 Implementing ProPOSEL as a Python 
dictionary  
The Python programming language has a dic-
tionary mapping object with entries in the form 
of (key, value) pairs. Each key must be unique 
and immutable (e.g. a string or tuple), while the 
values can be any type (e.g. a list). This data 
structure can be exploited by transforming Pro-
POSEL into a live Python dictionary, where the 
recommended access strategy is via compound 
keys (word form and C5 PoS tag) which 
uniquely identify each lexical entry. Thus, using 
a sample of 4 entries to represent ProPOSEL and 
version 0.8 of NLTK, we can use the code in 
Listing 1 (?next page) to convert this mini lexi-
con into the new formalism. The Python diction-
ary method returns an as yet unsorted dictionary, 
where the data structure itself is represented by

observations on syllable count, lexical stress pat-

proPOSEL = dict(zip(lexKeys, lexValues)) 
Listing 1: Code snippet using Python list comprehensions and built-ins to transform the prosody-PoS 
English Lexicon into an associative array 
 
 
    For linkage with corpora and for annotating 
a corpus with the prior knowledge of phonol-
ogy contained in ProPOSEL, a match is sought 
between incoming corpus text in the familiar 
(token, tag) format and the dictionary keys 
(?Table 5). Thus intersection enables corpus 
text to accumulate additional values which 
have the potential to become features for ma-
chine learning tasks. This lookup mechanism 
is relatively straightforward for corpora tagged 
with C5, the basic tagset used in the BNC. For 
corpora tagged with alternative schemes (i.e. 
Penn, LOB, and C7), incoming tokens and 
tags can either be matched against word forms 
and PoS tokens in the corresponding tagset 
field in the lexicon, or C5 tags can be ap-
pended to each item in the input text such that 
lookup can proceed in the normal way. 
6 Filtered searches and having fun 
with ProPOSEL  
ProPOSEL will be supported by a tutorial, of-
fering a range of Python software compatible 
with NLTK, to enable users to prepare the text 
file for NLP; to implement ProPOSEL as a 
Python dictionary; to cross-reference linguistic 
data in the lexicon and corpus text; and to cus-
tomise searches via multiple criteria.  
The previous section demonstrated how 
fine-grained grammatical distinctions in the 
PoS tag field(s) in ProPOSEL are integral to 
linkage with corpora. It also demonstrated how 
an electronic dictionary in the form of a simple 
text file can be reconceived and reconstituted 
as a computational data structure known as an 
associative memory or array. When Pro-
POSEL is thus transformed, filtered searches 
can be performed on the text itself. 
Brierley and Atwell (ibid.) present auto-
matic corpus annotations achieved via inter-
section of two parallel iterables: ProPOSEL?s 
keys and a LOB-tagged corpus extract (this is 
a short extract of 153 tokens just for demon-
stration) which also carries equivalent C5 tags 
generated from the lexicon. A successful 
match between C5 tags in both lists results in a 
corpus sequence object where word tokens and 
syntactic annotations have now been comple-
mented with prosodic information from se-
lected fields in ProPOSEL, as in Table 6: 
 
[["aren't", 'BER+XNOT', 'VBB+XX0', 
['1', '1', 'CF', "'#nt:1"]] 
Table 6: Entry index of length 3, with word 
token mapped to LOB and C5 tags plus sylla-
ble count, lexical stress pattern, CFP status and 
syllable-stress mapping  
 
The corpus sequence object can now be 
queried. Suppose, for instance, we wanted to 
find all bi-syllabic prepositions and particles in 
28
this extract. By specifying part-of-speech and 
syllable count, we unearth just one candidate 
matching our search criteria, as shown in Ta-
ble 7: 
 
['between', 'IN', 'PRP', ['2', '01', 
'F', "bI:0 'twin:1"]] 
Table 7: There is one candidate in the 153 
word extract which meets the condition: PoS 
equals preposition or particle and syllable 
count is 2  
 
It is not always necessary to transform Pro-
POSEL into a Python dictionary, however. 
Users can also read in the lexicon textfile, ap-
ply Python?s splitlines() method to process the 
text as a list of lines, and then apply the split() 
method, with the pipe field separator as argu-
ment, to tokenize each field. Listing 2 presents 
this much more succinctly:  
 
lexicon = open(?filepath?, ?rU?).read() 
lexicon = lexicon.splitlines() 
lexicon = [line.split('|') for line in 
lexicon] 
 
Listing2: Reading in ProPOSEL as a nested 
structure   
 
Users can then perform a search on a de-
fined subset of the lexicon. For example, users 
may wish to retrieve all entries with seven syl-
lables from the lexicon.  As well as returning 
items like: industrialisation, operating-theatre, 
and radioactivity, Listing 3 discovers the 
rather intriguing sir roger de coverley! 
  
for index in lexicon: 
if index[6] == '7': # look in the subset 
print index[0] # return word form(s) 
 
Listing 3: Searching a subset of the lexicon  
 
Another illustration would be finding words 
which rhyme. If we wanted to find all the 
words which rhyme with corpus in the lexi-
con, we could search field (4), for example, 
the SAM-PA phonetic transcriptions, for simi-
lar strings to /'kOp@s/. One way of doing 
this would be to compile a regular expression, 
substituting the metacharacter . for the ?c? in 
corpus and then seek a match in the SAM-PA 
field4. We might also look for minimal pairs, 
replacing the phoneme /s/ with the phoneme 
/z/ as in /'.Op@z/. Retaining the apostrophe 
as diacritic for primary stress before the wild-
card here imitates the lexical stress pattern for 
corpus and is part of the rhyme. It transpires 
there is only one candidate which rhymes with 
corpus in the lexicon and two half rhymes. 
Listing4 gives us porpoise /'pOp@s/ and then 
paupers /'pOp@z/ and torpors /'tOp@z/. 
  
p1 = re.compile("'.Op@s") 
p2 = re.compile("'.Op@z") 
sampa = [index[3] for index in lexicon]  
rhymes1 = p1.findall(' '.join(sampa)) 
rhymes2 = p2.findall(' '.join(sampa))

bi-syllabic words with primary stress on the 
first syllable that rhyme with corpus 
 
7 Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon 
ProPOSEL and associated access tools are 
presented to the CogALex workshop audience 
to illustrate our approach to enhancing the 
structure, indexing and entry points of elec-
tronic dictionaries. As the Call for Papers 
notes, ?Access strategies vary with the task 
(text understanding vs. text production) and 
the knowledge available at the moment of con-
sultation (word, concept, sound). Unlike read-
ers who look for meanings, writers start from 
them, searching for the corresponding words. 
While paper dictionaries are static, permitting 
only limited strategies for accessing informa-
tion, their electronic counterparts promise dy-
namic, proactive search via multiple criteria 
(meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse 
access routes. ? The goal of this workshop is 
to perform the groundwork for the next gen-
eration of electronic dictionaries, that is, to 
study the possibility of integrating the differ-
ent resources ?? ProPOSEL integrates a range 
of different resources, and enables a variety of 
access strategies, with consultation based on 
various combinations of partial syntactic and 
prosodic knowledge of the target words. It ad-
dresses the main themes of the workshop:

 Note that Python lists start at index 0, hence in 
Listing 4, the SAM-PA field is at position [3] in the 
inner list of tokenized list fields for each entry. 
29
7.1 Conceptual input of a dictionary user 
Human users of electronic dictionaries can 
start from partial concepts or patterns when 
they are generating a message or looking for a 
(target) word. Other papers in the workshop 
focus on semantic cues, such as conceptual 
primitives, semantically related words, some 
type of partial definition, something like syn-
sets etc; but speakers/writers may also be 
searching for a word which matches syntactic, 
phonetic or prosodic partial patterns, for ex-
ample seeking a matching rhythm or rhyme. 
 
7.2 Access, navigation and search strategies 
The Call for Papers notes that ?we would 
like to be able to access entries by word form 
but also by meaning and sounds (syllables) 
?Even if input is given in an incomplete, im-
precise or degraded form.? Meaning is clearly 
the main focus of many lexicography re-
searchers, but access by sound, rhythm, pros-
ody, and also syntactic similarity may also 
prove useful complementary strategies for 
some users. 
 
7.3 Indexing words and organizing the lexi-
con 
Another key issue for discussion in the Call 
for Papers is robust yet flexible organization of 
lexical resources: ?Indexing must robustly al-
low for multiple ways of navigation and ac-
cess? ?. By building on and integrating with 
Python and the NLTK Natural Language Tool 
Kit, ProPOSEL can be accessed by other NLP 
tools or via the standard Python interface for 
direct browsing and search. ProPOSEL is also 
a potential exemplar for lexical entry stan-
dardization. Many lexicographers focus on 
standardization of semantics or definitions, but 
standardization of syntactic, phonetic and pro-
sodic information is also an issue. Our prag-
matic approach is to integrate lexical entries 
from a range of resources into a standardized 
Python dictionary format.  
 
7.4 NLP Applications 
We initially developed ProPOSEL in the con-
text of research in linking lexical, syntactic 
and prosodic markup in English corpus text, 
and specifically as a resource for prosodic 
phrase break prediction (Brierley and Atwell, 
2007a,b,c).  The software developed within the 
NLTK architecture has been able to utilize 
existing NLTK tools for PoS-tagging, phrase-
chunking and partial parsing; in turn, other 
researchers in these fields may want to use the 
syntactic information in ProPOSEL in their 
future NLP applications, particularly in re-
search which attempts to compare or map be-
tween alternative tagsets or labeling systems, 
eg (Nancarrow and Atwell 2007), Atwell and 
Roberts 2006), (Atwell et al2000), (Teufel 
1995).  
8 Conclusions 
The English lexicon presented in this paper, - a 
revised version to that reported in (Brierley 
and Atwell, 2008), - is an assembly of domain 
knowledge of phonology and syntax from sev-
eral widely used lexical resources. Linkage 
with corpora is facilitated by the inclusion of 
four variant PoS tagging schemes in the lexi-
con and by re-thinking and reconstituting the 
lexicon as a Python dictionary or associative 
array. A successful match between (token, tag) 
pairings in input text and new linguistic anno-
tations mapped to ProPOSEL?s compound 
keys will in turn embed a priori knowledge 
from the lexicon in data-driven models derived 
from a corpus and enhance performance in 
machine learning. The lexicon is also human-
oriented (de Schryver, 2003). ProPOSEL?s 
software tools are compatible with NLTK and 
enable users to define and search a subset of 
the lexicon and access entries by word class, 
phonetic transcription, syllable count and 
rhythmic structure.  ProPOSEL was initially 
developed as a language engineering resource 
for use in our own research, but in the process 
of development we have also addressed sev-
eral more general issues relating to cognitive 
aspects of the lexicon: the partial patterns in 
the mind of a dictionary user; the need for ac-
cess and search by sound, rhythm, prosody, 
and also syntactic similarity; robust and stan-
dardised organization of lexical entries from 
different sources; and ease of integration into 
NLP applications.
