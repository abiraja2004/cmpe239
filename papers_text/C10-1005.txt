Abstract
Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of
text, does not end at language boundaries.
Cross-language plagiarism occurs if a text
is translated from a fragment written in a
different language and no proper citation
is provided. Regardless of the change of
language, the contents and, in particular,
the ideas remain the same. Whereas dif-
ferent methods for the detection of mono-
lingual plagiarism have been developed,
less attention has been paid to the cross-
language case.
In this paper we compare two recently
proposed cross-language plagiarism de-
tection methods (CL-CNG, based on char-
acter n-grams and CL-ASA, based on sta-
tistical translation), to a novel approach
to this problem, based on machine trans-
lation and monolingual similarity analy-
sis (T+MA). We explore the effectiveness
of the three approaches for less related
languages. CL-CNG shows not be ap-
propriate for this kind of language pairs,
whereas T+MA performs better than the
previously proposed models.
1 Introduction
Plagiarism is a problem in many scientific and cul-
tural fields. Text plagiarism may imply differ-
ent operations: from a simple cut-and-paste, to
the insertion, deletion and substitution of words,
up to an entire process of paraphrasing. Differ-
ent models approach the detection of monolin-
gual plagiarism (Shivakumar and Garc??a-Molina,
1995; Hoad and Zobel, 2003; Maurer et al, 2006).
Each of these models is appropriate only in those
cases where all the implied documents are written
in the same language.
Nevertheless, the problem does not end at lan-
guage boundaries. Plagiarism is also committed if
the reused text is translated from a fragment writ-
ten in a different language and no citation is pro-
vided. When plagiarism is generated by a transla-
tion process, it is known as cross-language plagia-
rism (CLP).
Less attention has been paid to the detection of
this kind of plagiarism due to its enhanced diffi-
culty (Ceska et al, 2008; Barro?n-Ceden?o et al,
2008; Potthast et al, 2010). In fact, in the recently
held 1st International Competition on Plagiarism
Detection (Potthast et al, 2009), no participants
tried to approach it.
In order to describe the prototypical process of
automatic plagiarism detection, we establish the
following notation. Let dq be a plagiarism suspect
document. Let D be a representative collection
of reference documents. D presumably includes
the source of the potentially plagiarised fragments
in dq . Stein et al, (2007) divide the process into
three stages1:
1. heuristic retrieval of potential source doc-
uments: given dq, retrieving an appropri-
ate number of its potential source documents
D? ? D such that |D?|? |D|;
2. exhaustive comparison of texts: comparing
the text from dq and d ? D? in order to
identify reused fragments and their potential

plagiarism detection. Nevertheless, it can be applied with-
out further modifications to the cross-language case.

sources; and
3. knowledge-based post-processing: those de-
tected fragments with proper citation are dis-
carded as they are not plagiarised.
The result is offered to the human expert to take
the final decision. In the case of cross-language
plagiarism detection (CLPD), the texts are written
in different languages: dq ? L and d? ? L?.
In this research we focus on step 2: cross-
language exhaustive comparison of texts, ap-
proaching it as an Information Retrieval problem
of cross-language text similarity. Step 1, heuristic
retrieval, may be approached by different CLIR
techniques, such as those proposed by Dumais et
al. (1997) and Pouliquen et al (2003).
Cross-language similarity between texts,
?(dq, d?), has been previously estimated on
the basis of different models: multilingual
thesauri (Steinberger et al, 2002; Ceska et
al., 2008), comparable corpora ?CL-Explicit
Semantic Analysis CL-ESA? (Potthast et
al., 2008), machine translation techniques
?CL-Alignment-based Similarity Analysis CL-
ASA? (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al, 2008; Pinto et al,
2009) and n-grams comparison ?CL-Character
n-Grams CL-CNG? (Mcnamee and Mayfield,
2004).
A comparison of CL-ASA, CL-ESA, and CL-
CNG was carried out recently by Potthast et
al. (2010). The authors report that in general,
despite its simplicity, CL-CNG outperformed the
other two models. Additionally, CL-ESA showed
good results in the cross-language retrieval of
topic-related texts, whereas CL-ASA obtained
better results in exact (human) translations.
However, most of the language pairs used in the
reported experiments (English-{German, Span-
ish, French, Dutch, Polish}) are related, whether
because they have common predecessors or be-
cause a large proportion of their vocabularies
share common roots. In fact, the lower syntactical
relation between the English-Polish pair caused
a performance degradation for CL-CNG, and for
CL-ASA to a lesser extent. In order to confirm
whether the closeness among languages is an im-
portant factor, this paper works with more dis-
tant language pairs: English-Basque and Spanish-
Basque.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 describes the motivation for working
on this research topic, stressing the situation of
cross-language plagiarism among writers in less
resourced languages. A brief overview of the few
works on CLPD is included. The three similar-
ity estimation models compared in this research
work are presented in Section 3. The experimental
framework and the obtained results are included
in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions
and discusses further work.
2 Motivation
Cases of CLP are common nowadays because in-
formation in multiple languages is available on the
Web, but people still write in their own language.
This special kind of plagiarism occurs more often
when the target language is a less resourced one2,
as is the case of Basque.
Basque is a pre-indoeuropean language with
less than a million speakers in the world and
no known relatives in the language families
(Wikipedia, 2010a). Still, Basque shares a portion
of its vocabulary with its contact languages (Span-
ish and French). Therefore, we decided to work
with two language pairs: Basque with Spanish,
its contact language, and with English, perhaps
the language with major influence over the rest of
languages in the world. Although the considered
pairs share most of their alphabet, the vocabulary
and language typologies are very different. For
instance Basque is an agglutinative language.
In order to illustrate the relations among these
languages, Fig. 1 includes extracts from the En-
glish (en), Spanish (es) and Basque (eu) versions
of the same Wikipedia article. The fragments are
a sample of the lexical and syntactic distance be-
tween Basque and the other two languages. In
fact, these sentences are completely co-derived
and the corresponding entire articles are a sample
of the typical imbalance in text available in the dif-
ferent languages (around 2, 000, 1, 300, and only
2Less resourced language is that with a low degree of rep-
resentation on the Web (Alegria et al, 2009). Whereas the
available text for German, French or Spanish is less than for
English, the difference is more dramatic with other languages
such as Basque.

The Party of European Socialists (PES) is
a European political party comprising thirty-two
socialist, social democratic and labour parties
from each European Union member state and
Norway.

cles, respectively).
Of high relevance is that the two corpora used
in this work were manually constructed by trans-
lating English and Spanish text into Basque. In the
experiments carried out by Potthast et al (2010),
which inspired our work, texts from the JCR-
Acquis corpus (Steinberger et al, 2006) and
Wikipedia were used. The first one is a multilin-
gual corpus with no clear definition of source and
target languages, whereas in Wikipedia no spe-
cific relationship exists between the different lan-
guages in which a topic may be broached. In some
cases (cf. Fig. 1) they are clearly co-derived, but
in others they are completely independent.
CLPD has been investigated just recently,
mainly by adapting models formerly proposed
for cross-language information retrieval. This
is the case of cross-language explicit seman-
tic analysis (CL-ESA), proposed by Potthast et
al. (2008). In this case the comparison be-
tween texts is not carried out directly. Instead,
a comparable corpus CL,L? is required, contain-
ing documents on multiple topics in the two im-
plied languages. One of the biggest corpora
of this nature is Wikipedia. The similarity be-
tween dq ? L and every document c ? CL
is computed based on the cosine measure. The
same process is made for L?. This step gener-
ates two vectors [cos(dq, c1), . . . , cos(dq, c|CL|)]
and [cos(d?, c?1), . . . , cos(d?, c?|CL? |)], where each
dimension is comparable between the two vectors.
Therefore, the cosine between such vectors can be
estimated in order to ?indirectly? estimate how
similar dq and d? are. The authors suggest that this
model can be used for CLPD.
Another recent model is MLPlag, proposed by
Ceska et al (2008). It exploits the EuroWord-
Net Thesaurus3, that includes sets of synonyms in
multiple European languages, with common iden-
tifiers across languages. The authors report ex-
periments over a subset of documents of the En-
glish and Czech sections of the JRC-Acquis cor-
pus as well as a corpus of simplified vocabulary4 .
The main difficulty they faced was the amount of
words in the documents not included in the the-
saurus (approximately 50% of the vocabulary).
This is a very similar approach to that pro-
posed by Pouliquen et al (2003) for the identi-
fication of document translations. In fact, both
approaches have something in common: transla-
tions are searched at document level. It is assumed
that an entire document has been reused (trans-
lated). Nevertheless, a writer is free to plagiarise
text fragments from different sources, and com-
pose a mixture of original and reused text.
A third model is the cross-language alignment-
based similarity analysis (CL-ASA), proposed by
Barro?n-Ceden?o et al (2008), which is based on
statistical machine translation technology. This
model was proposed to detect plagiarised text
fragments (similar models have been proposed for
extraction of parallel sentences from comparable
corpora (Munteanu et al, 2004)). The authors
report experiments over a short set of texts from
which simulated plagiarism was created from En-
glish to Spanish. Human as well as automatic ma-
chine translations were included in the collection.
Further descriptions of this model are included in
Section 3, as it is one of those being assessed in
this research work.
To the best of our knowledge, no work (in-
cluding the three previously mentioned) has been
done considering less resourced languages. In this
research work we approach the not uncommon
problem of CLPD in Basque, with source texts
written in Spanish (the co-official language of the

Basque Country) and English (the language with
most available texts in the world).
We compare three cross-language similarity
analysis methods: T+MA (translation followed
by monolingual analysis), a novel method based
on machine translation followed by a monolin-
gual similarity estimation; CL-CNG, a character
n-gram based comparison model; and CL-ASA
a model that combines translation and similarity
estimation in a single step. Neither MLPlag nor
CL-ESA are included in the comparison. On the
one hand, we are interested in plagiarism at sen-
tence level, and MLPlag is designed to compare
entire documents. On the other hand, in previous
experiments over exact translations, CL-ASA has
shown to outperform it on language pairs whose
alphabet or syntax are unrelated (Potthast et al,
2010). This is precisely the case of en-eu and
es-eu language pairs. Additionally, the amount
of Wikipedia articles in Basque available for the
construction of the required comparable corpus is
insufficient for the CL-ESA data requirements.
3 Definition of Models
In this section, we describe the three cross-
language similarity models we compare. For ex-
perimental purposes (cf. Section 4) we consider
dq to be a suspicious sentence written in L and
D? to be a collection of potential source sentences
written in L? (L 6= L?). The text pre-processing
required by the different models is summarised
in Table 1. Examples illustrating how the models
work are included in Section 4.3.
3.1 Translation + Monolingual Analysis
dq ? L is translated into L? on the basis of
the Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003), Moses (Koehn
et al, 2007) and SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) tools,
generating d?q . The translation system uses a
log-linear combination of state-of-the-art features,
such as translation probabilities and lexical trans-
lation models on both directions and a target lan-
guage model. After translation, d?q and d? are
lexically related, making possible a monolingual
comparison.
Multiple translations from dq into d?q are pos-
sible. Therefore, performing a monolingual sim-
ilarity analysis based on ?traditional? techniques,
such as those based on word n-grams compari-
son (Broder, 1997) or hash collisions (Schleimer
et al, 2003), is not an option. Instead, we take the
approach of the bag-of-words, which has shown
good results in the estimation of monolingual text
similarity (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al, 2009). Words in
d?q and d? are weighted by the standard tf -idf , and
the similarity between them is estimated by the
cosine similarity measure.
3.2 CL-Alignment-based Similarity Analysis
In this model an estimation of how likely is that d?
is a translation of dq is performed. It is based on
the adaptation of the Bayes rule for MT:
p(d? | dq) = p(d
?) p(dq | d?)
p(dq)
. (1)
As p(dq) does not depend on d?, it is neglected.
From an MT point of view, the conditional prob-
ability p(dq | d?) is known as translation model
probability and is computed on the basis of a sta-
tistical bilingual dictionary. p(d?) is known as lan-
guage model probability; it describes the target
language L? in order to obtain grammatically ac-
ceptable translations (Brown et al, 1993).
Translating dq into L? is not the concern of
this method, rather it focuses on retrieving texts
written in L? which are potential translations of
dq . Therefore, Barro?n-Ceden?o et al (2008) pro-
posed replacing the language model (the one used
in T+MA) by that known as length model. This
model depends on text?s character lengths instead
of language structures.
Multiple translations from d into L? are possi-
ble, and it is uncommon to find a pair of translated
texts d and d? such that |d| = |d?|. Nevertheless,
the length of such translations is closely related
to a translation length factor. In accordance with
Pouliquen et al (2003), the length model is de-
fined as:
40
?(d?) = e
?0.5
0
B
@
|d?|
|dq| ??
?
1
C
A
2
, (2)
where ? and ? are the mean and the standard devi-
ation of the character lengths between translations
of texts from L into L?. If the length of d? is not the
expected given dq, it receives a low qualification.
The translation model probability is defined as:
p(d | d?) =
Y
x?d
X
y?d?
p(x, y), (3)
where p(x, y), a statistical bilingual dictionary,
represents the likelihood that x is a valid transla-
tion of y. After estimating p(x, y) from a parallel
corpus, on the basis of the IBM statistical trans-
lation models (Brown et al, 1993), we consider,
for each word x, only the k best translations y
(those with the highest probabilities) up to a min-
imum probability mass of 0.4. This threshold was
empirically selected as it eliminated noisy entries
without discarding an important amount of rele-
vant pairs.
The similarity estimation based on CL-ASA is
finally computed as:
?(dq, d?) = ?(d?) p(dq | d?). (4)
3.3 CL-Character n-Gram Analysis
This model, the simplest of those compared in this
research, has been used in (monolingual) Author-
ship Attribution (Keselj et al, 2003) as well as
cross-language Information Retrieval (Mcnamee
and Mayfield, 2004). The simplified alphabet con-
sidered is ? = {a, . . . , z, 0, . . . , 9}; any other
symbol is discarded (cf. Table 1). The resulting
text strings are codified into character 3-grams,
which are weighted by the standard tf -idf (con-
sidering this n has previously shown to produce
the best results). The similarity between such rep-
resentations of dq and d? is estimated by the cosine
similarity measure.
4 Experiments
The objective of our experiments is to compare
the performance of the three similarity estimation
models. Section 4.1 introduces the corpora we
have exploited. The experimental framework is
described in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 illustrates
how the models work, and the obtained results are
presented and discussed in Section 4.4.
4.1 Corpora
In other Information Retrieval tasks a plethora of
corpora is available for experimental and compar-
ison purposes. However, plagiarism implies an
ethical infringement and, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there is no corpora of actual cases available,
other than some seminal efforts on creating cor-
pora of text reuse (Clough et al, 2002), artificial
plagiarism (Potthast et al, 2009), and simulated
plagiarism (Clough and Stevenson, 2010). The
problem is worse for cross-language plagiarism.
Therefore, in our experiments we use two
parallel corpora: Software, an en-eu translation
memory of software manuals generously supplied
by Elhuyar Fundazioa5; and Consumer, a cor-
pus extracted from a consumer oriented mag-
azine that includes articles written in Spanish
along with their Basque, Catalan, and Galician
translations6 (Alca?zar, 2006). Software includes
288, 000 parallel sentences; 8.66 (6.83) words per
sentence in the English (Basque) section. Con-
sumer contains 58, 202 sentences; 19.77 (15.20)
words per sentence in Spanish (Basque). These
corpora also reflect the imbalance of text available
in the different languages.
4.2 Experimental Framework
We consider Dq and D? to be two entire docu-
ments from which plagiarised sentences and their
source are to be detected. We work at this level
of granularity, and not entire documents, for two
main reasons: (i) we are focused on the exhaus-
tive comparison stage of the plagiarism detection
process (cf. Section 1); and (ii) even a single sen-
tence could be considered a case of plagiarism,
as it transmits a complete idea. However, a pla-
giarised sentence is usually not enough to auto-
matically negate the validity of an entire docu-
ment. This decision is left to the human expert,
which can examine the documents where several
plagiarised sentences occur. Note that the task be-
comes computationally more expensive as, for ev-
ery sentence, we are looking through thousands

of topically-related sentences that are potential
sources of dq, and not only those of a specific doc-
ument.
CLPD is considered a ranking problem. Let
dq ? Dq be a plagiarism suspicious sentence and
d? ? D? be its source sentence. We consider that
the result of the process is correct if, given dq, d?
is properly retrieved. A 5-fold cross validation for
both en-eu and es-eu was performed. Bilingual
dictionaries, language and length models were es-
timated with the corresponding training partitions.
The computed values for ? and ? are those in-
cluded in Table 2. The values for the different
partitions are very similar, showing the low vari-
ability in the translation lengths. On the basis of
these estimated parameters, an example of length
factor for a specific sentence is plotted in Fig. 2.
In the test partitions, for each suspicious sen-
tence dq , 11, 640 source candidate sentences exist
for es-eu and 57, 290 for en-eu. This results in
more than 135 million and 3 billion comparisons
carried out for es-eu and en-eu respectively.

4.3 Illustration of Models
In order to clarify how the different models work,
consider the following sentence pair, a suspicious
sentence dq written in Basque and its source d?
written in English (sentences are short for illustra-
tive purposes):
dq beste dokumentu batzuetako makroak ezin dira atzitu.
d? macros from other documents are not accessible.
CL-CNG Example
In this case, symbols and spaces are discarded.
Sentences become:
dq bestedokumentubatzuetakomakroakezindiraatzitu
d? macrosfromotherdocumentsarenotaccessible
Only three 3-grams appear in both sentences
(ume, men, ent). In order to keep the example sim-
ple, the 3-grams are weighted by tf only (in the
actual experiments, tf -idf is used), resulting in a
dot product of 3. The corresponding vectors mag-
nitudes are |dq| = 6.70 and |d?| = 5.65. There-
fore, the estimated similarity is ?(dq, d?) = 0.079.
CL-ASA Example
In this case, the text must be tokenised and lem-
matised, resulting in the following string:
dq beste dokumentu batzu makro ezin izan atzi .
d? macro from other document be not accessible .
The sentences? lengths are |dq| = 38 and |d?| =
39. Therefore, on the basis of Eq. 2, the length
factor between them is ?(dq, d?) = 0.998.
The relevant entries of the previously estimated
dictionary are included in Table 3. Such entries
are substituted in Eq. 3, and the overall process
results in a similarity ?(dq , d?) = 2.74. Whereas
not a stochastic value, this is a weight used when
ranking all the potential source sentences in D?.
T+MA Example
In this case, the same pre-processing than
in CL-ASA is performed. In T+MA dq is
translated into L?, resulting in the new pair:
d?q other document macro cannot be access .
d? macro from other document be not accessible .
42
Note that d?q is a valid translation of dq . Never-
theless, it has few syntactic relation to d?. There-
fore, applying more sophisticated codifications
than the cosine measure over bag-of-words is not
an option. The example is again simplified by
weighting the words based on tf . Five words ap-
pear in both sentences, resulting in a dot product
of 5. The vectors magnitudes are |d?q| = |d?| =?
7. The estimation by T+MA is ?(dq, d?) =
0.71, a high similarity level.
4.4 Results and Discussion
For evaluation we consider a standard measure:
Recall. More specifically Recall after n texts have
been retrieved (n = [1 . . . , 50]). Figure 3 plots the
average Recall value obtained in the 5-folds with
respect to the rank position (n).
In both language pairs, CL-CNG obtained
worse results than those reported for English-
Polish by Potthast et al (2010): R@50 = 0.68
vs. R@50 = 0.53 for es-eu and 0.28 for en-eu.
This is due to the fact that neither the vocabulary
nor its corresponding roots keep important rela-
tions. Therefore, when language pairs have a low
syntactical relationship, CL-CNG is not an op-
tion. Still, CL-CNG performs better with es-eu
than with en-eu because the first pair is composed
of contact languages (cf. Section 1).
About CL-ASA, the results obtained with es-
eu and en-eu are quite different: R@50 = 0.68
for en-eu and R@50 = 0.53 for es-eu. Whereas
in the first case they are comparable to those of
CL-CNG, in the second one CL-ASA completely
outperforms it. The improvement of CL-ASA ob-
tained for en-eu is due to the size of the training
corpus available in this case (approximately five
times the number of sentences available for es-
eu). This shows the sensitivity of the model with
respect to the size of the available resources.
Lastly, although T+MA is a simple approach
that reduces the cross-language similarity estima-
tion to a translation followed by a monolingual
process, it obtained a good performance (R@50=
0.77 for en-eu and R@50=0.89 for es-eu). More-
over, this method proved to be less sensitive than
CL-ASA to the lack of resources. This could
be due to the fact that it considers both direc-
tions of the translation model (e[n|s]-eu and eu-

in order to compose syntactically correct transla-
tions, reduces the amount of wrong translations
and, indirectly, includes more syntactic informa-
tion in the process. On the contrary, CL-ASA

e[n|s] and completely disregards syntactical rela-
tions between the texts.
Note that the better results come at the cost
of higher computational demand. CL-CNG only
requires easy to compute string comparisons.
CL-ASA requires translation probabilities from
aligned corpora, but once the probabilities are es-
timated, cross-language similarity can be com-
puted very fast. T+MA requires the previous
translation of all the texts, which can be very
costly for large collections.
5 Conclusions and Further Work
In a society where information in multiple lan-
guages is available on the Web, cross-language
43
plagiarism is occurring every day with increasing
frequency. Still, cross-language plagiarism de-
tection has not been approached sufficiently due
to its intrinsic complexity. Though few attempts
have been made, even less work has been made to
tackle this problem for less resourced languages,
and to explore distant language pairs.
We investigated the case of Basque, a lan-
guage where, due to the lack of resources, cross-
language plagiarism is often committed from texts
in Spanish and English. Basque has no known rel-
atives in the language family. However, it shares
some of its vocabulary with Spanish.
Two state-of-the-art methods based on trans-
lation probabilities and n-gram overlapping, and
a novel technique based on statistical machine
translation were evaluated. The novel technique
obtains the best results in both language pairs,
with the n-gram overlap technique performing
worst. In this sense, our results complement those
of Potthast et al (2010), which includes closely
related language pairs as well.
Our results also show that better results come at
the cost of more expensive processing time. For
the future, we would like to investigate such per-
formance trade-offs in more demanding datasets.
For future work we consider that exploring se-
mantic text features across languages could im-
prove the results. It could be interesting to fur-
ther analyse how the reordering of words through
translations might be relevant for this task. Addi-
tionally, working with languages even more dis-
tant from each other, such as Arabic or Hindi,
seems to be a challenging and interesting task.
