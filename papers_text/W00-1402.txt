Abstract 
We present an evaluation framework in 
which the effectiveness of evaluative 
arguments can be measured with real users. 
The framework is based on the task-efficacy 
evaluation method. An evaluative argument 
is presented in the context of a decision task 
and measures related to its effectiveness are 
assessed. Within this framework, we are 
currently running a formal experiment o 
verify whether argument effectiveness can 
be increased by tailoring the argument to the 
user and by varying the degree of argument 
conciseness. 
Introduction 
Empirical methods are fundamental in any 
scientific endeavour to assess progress and to 
stimulate new research questions. As the field of 
NLG matures, we are witnessing a growing 
interest in studying empirical methods to 
evaluate computational models of discourse 
generation (Dale, Eugenio et al 1998). 
However, with the exception of (Chu-Carroll 
and Carberry 1998), little attention as been paid 
to the evaluation of systems generating 
evaluative arguments, communicative acts that 
attempt o affect the addressee's attitudes (i.e. 
evaluative tendencies typically phrased in terms 
of like and dislike or favor and disfavor). 
The ability to generate valuative arguments i
critical in an increasing number of online 
systems that serve as .personal :assistants, 
advisors, or sales asslstants ~.For instance, a 
travel assistant may need to compare two 
vacation packages and argue that its current user 
should like one more than the other. 
i See for instance www.activebuyersguide.com 
In this paper, we present an evaluation 
framework in which the effectiveness of 
evaluative arguments can be measured with real 
users. The measures of argument effectiveness 
used in our framework are based on principles 
developed in social psychology to study 
persuasion (Miller and Levine 1996). We are 
currently applying the framework to evaluate 
arguments generated by an argument generator 
we have developed (Carenini 2000). To facilitate 
the evaluation of specific aspects of the 
generation process, the argument generator has 
been designed so that its functional components 
can be easily turned-offor changed. 
In the remainder of the paper, we first describe 
our argument generator. Then, we summarize 
literature on persuasion from social psychology. 
Next, we discuss previous work on evaluating 
NLG models. Finally, we describe our 
evaluation framework and the design of an 
experiment we are currently running. 
1 The Argument Generator 
The architecture of the argument generator is a 
typical pipelined architecture comprising a 
discourse planner, a microplanner and a sentence 
real izer. 
The input to the planning process is an abstract 
evaluative communicative action expressing: 
- The subject of the evaluation, which can be 
an entity or a comparison between two 
entities in the~.domain of interest (e.g., a 
house or a comparison between two houses 
in the real-estate domain). 
An evaluation, which is a number in the 
interval \[0,1\] where, depending on the 
subject, 0 means "terrible" or "much worse" 
and 1 means "excellent" or "much better"). 
Given an abstract communicative action, the 
discourse planner (Young and Moore 1994) 
selects and arranges the content of the argument

by decomposing abstract communicative actions 
into primitive ones and by imposing appropriate 
ordering constraints among communicative 
actions. Two knowledge sources are involved in 
this process: 
- A complex model of the user's preferences 
based on multiattribute utilility theory 
(MAUT)(Clemen 1996). 
- A set of plan operators, implementing 
guidelines for content selection and 
organ(sat(on from argumentation theory 
(Carenini and Moore 2000). 
By using these two knowledge sources, the 
discourse planner produces a text plan for an 
argument whose content and organization are 
tailored to the user according to argumentation 
theory. 
Next, the text plan is passed tO the"microptanner 
which performs aggregation, pronominalization 
and makes decisions about cue phrases. 
Aggregation is performed according to heuristics 
similar to the ones proposed in (Shaw 1998). For 
pronominalization, simple rules based on 
centering are applied (Grosz. Josh( et al 1995). 
arguments in order of decreasing expected effectiveness for the target user SUB J-26 
Finally, decisions about cue phrases are made 
according to a decision tree based on 
suggestions from (Knott 1996; di Eugenio, 
Moore et el. 1997) . The sentence realizer 
extends previous work on realizing evaluative 
statements (Elhadad 1995). 
The argument generator has been designed to 
facilitate the testing of the effectiveness of 
different aspects of the generation process. The 
experimenter can easily vary the expected 
effectiveness of the generated arguments by 
controlling whether the generator tailors the 
argument o the current user, the degree of 
conciseness of the generated arguments and 
what microplanning tasks are performed. 
Figure 1 shows three arguments generated by the 
argument generator that clearly illustrate this 
feature. We-expect the first-argument to be very 
effective for the target user. Its content and 
organization has been tailored to her 
preferences. Also, the argument is reasonably 
fluent because of aggregation, pronominalization 
and cue phrases. In contrast, we expect the 
second argument to be less effective with our 
10 
target user, because it is not tailored to her 
preferences 2, and it appears to be somewhat too 
verbose 3.Finally, we expect he third arguments 
not to be effective at all. It suffers from all the 
shortcomings of the second argument, with the 
additional weakness of not being fluent (no 
microplannig tasks were performed). 
2 
A final note-on the evaluation of arguments. An ........ 
argument can also be evaluated by the argument 
addressee with respect o several dimensions of 
quality, such as coherence, content, 
organization, writing style and convincingness. 
However, evaluations based on judgements 
along these dimensions are clearly weaker than 
evaluations measuring actual attitudinal and 
Arguing an evaluation involves an intentional 
communicative act that attempts to affect the 
current or future behavior of the addressees by 
creating, changing or reinforcing the addressees' 
attitudes. It follows that the effectiveness of an 
evaluative argument can be tested by comparing 
measurements of subjects' attitudes or behavior 
before and after their exposure to the argument. 
In many experimental situations, however, 
measuring effects on overt behavior can be 
problematic (Miller and Levine 1996), therefore 
most research on persuasion has been based 
either on measurements of attitudes or on 
declaration of behavioral intentions. The most 
common technique to measure attitudes is 
subject self-report (Miller and Levine 1996). 
Typically, self-report measurements involve the 
use of a scale that consists of two "'bipolar" 
terms (e.g., good-choice vs. bad-choice), usually 
separated by seven or nine equal spaces that 
participants use to evaluate an attitude or belief 
statement (see Figure 4 for examples). 
Research in persuasion suggests that some 
individuals may be naturally more resistant o 
persuasion than others (Miller and Levine 1996). 
Individual features that seem to matter are: 
argumentativeness (tendency to argue)(lnfante 
and Rancer 1982), intelligence, self-esteem and 
need for cognition (tendency to engage in and to 
enjoy effortful cognitive endeavours)(Cacioppo, 
Petty et al 1983). Any experiment in persuasion 
should control for these variables.

user, for whom all aspects of a house are equally 
important. With respect o the first argument, notice 
the different evaluation for the location and the 
different order between the two text segments about 
location and quality. 
3 A threshold controlling verbosity was set to its 
maximum value. 
Several empirical methods have been proposed 
and applied in the literature for evaluating NLG 
models. We discuss now why, among the three 
main evaluation methods (i.e., human judges, 
corpus-based and task efficacy), task efficacy 
appears to be the most appropriate for testing the 
effectiveness of evaluative arguments that are 
tailored to a complex model of the user's 
preferences. 
The human judges evaluation method requires a 
panel of judges to score outputs of generation 
models (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1998; Lester 
and Porter March 1997). The main limitation of  
this approach is that the input of the generation 
process needs to be simple enough to be easily 
understood by judges 4. Unfortunately, this is not 
the case for our argument generator, where the 
input consists of a possibly complex and novel 
argument subject (e.g., a new house with a large 
number of features), and a complex model of the 
user's preferences. 
The corpus-based valuation method (Robin and 
McKeown 1996) can be applied only when a 
corpus of input/output pairs is available. A 
portion of the corpus (the training set) is used to 
develop a computational model of how the 
output can be generated from the input. The rest 
of the corpus (the testing set) is used to evaluate 
the model. Unfortunately, a corpus for our 
generator does. not exist. Furthermore, it would 
be difficult and extremely time-consuming to 
obtain and analyze such a corpus given the 
complexity of our. generator..input/output pairs. 
4 See (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1998) tbr an 
illustration of how the specification of the context 
can become xtremely complex when human judges 
are used to evaluate content selection strategies for a 
dialog system.

? When a generator-is designed to generate output 
for users engaged in certain tasks, a natural way 
to evaluate its effectiveness is by experimenting 
with users performing those tasks. For instance, 
in (Young, to appear) different models for 
generating natural language descriptions of plans 
are evaluated by measuring how effectively 
users execute those plans given the descriptions. 
main sub-systems: the'IDEA system,- a Usei- ...... 
Model Refiner and the Argument Generator. The 
framework assumes that a model of the user's 
preferences based on MAUT has been 
previously acquired using traditional methods 
from decision theory (Edwards and Barron 
1994), to assure a reliable initial model. 
At the onset, the user is assigned the task to 
.This evaluatiort~ ,method,.,,~cal!ed~.:task.~.~effiea~y,,~ ~. , z,select~.?rara~,~\]~,:dataset..:.the:zfaur.most p~e?eazed ..... 
allows one to evaluate a generation model 
without explicitly evaluating its output but by 
measuring the output's effects on user's 
behaviors, beliefs and attitudes in the context of 
the task. The only requirement for this method is 
the specification of a sensible task. 
Task efficacy is the method we have adopted in 
our evaluation framework. 
4 The Evaluation Framework 
4.1 The task 
Aiming at general results, we chose a rather 
basic and frequent task that has been extensively 
studied in decision analysis: the selection of a 
subset of preferred objects (e.g., houses) out of a 
set of possible alternatives by considering trade- 
offs among multiple objectives (e.g., house 
location, house quality). The selection is 
performed by evaluating objects with respect to 
their values for a set of primitive attributes (e.g., 
house distance form the park, size of the 
garden). In the evaluation framework we have 
developed, the user performs this task by using a 
computer environment (shown in Figure 3) that 
supports interactive data exploration and 
analysis (IDEA) (Roth, Chuah et al 1997). The 
IDEA environment provides the user with a set 
of powerful visualization and direct 
manipulation techniques that facilitate user's 
autonomous exploration of the set of alternatives 
and the selection of the preferred alternatives. 
Let's examine now how the argument generator, 
that we described in Section 1, can be evaluated 
in the ,context of the ~selection =ta.sk, by gging. 
through the architecture of the evaluation 
framework. 
4.2 The f ramework  architecture 
alternatives and to place them in the Hot List 
(see Figure 3 upper right comer) ordered by 
preference. The IDEA system supports the user 
in this task (Figure 2 (I)). As the interaction 
unfolds, all user actions are monitored and 
collected in the User's Action History (Figure 2 
(2a)). Whenever the user feels that she has 
accomplished the task, the ordered list of 
preferred alternatives is saved as her Preliminary 
Decision (Figure 2 (2b)). After that, this list, the 
User's Action History and the initial Model of 
User's Preferences are analysed by the User 
Model Refiner (Figure 2 (3)) to produce a 
Refined Model of the User's Preferences (Figure 
2 (4)). 
At this point, the stage is set for argument 
generation. Given the Refined Model of the 
User's Preferences for the target selection task, 
the Argument Generator produces an evaluative 
argument tailored to the user's model (Figure 2 
(5-6)). Finally, the argument is presented to the 
user by the IDEA system (Figure 2 (7)). 
The argument goal is to introduce a new 
alternative (not included in the dataset initially 
presented to the user) and to persuade the user 
that the alternative is worth being considered. 
The new alternative is designed on the fly to be 
preferable for the user given her preference 
model. Once the argument is presented, the user 
may (a) decide to introduce the new alternative 
in her Hot List, or (b) decide to further explore 
the dataset, possibly making changes to the Hot 
List and introducing the new instance in the Hot 
List, or (c) do nothing. Figure 3 shows the 
display at the end of the interaction, when the 
user; after reading the argument, has decided to 
introduce the new alternative in the first 
position. 
Figure 2 shows the architecture of the evaluation 
framework. The framework consists of three

Figure 2 The evaluation f ramework  architecture 
Whenever the user decides to stop exploring and 
is satisfied and confident with her final 
selections, measures related to argument's 
effectiveness can be assessed (Figure 2 (8)). 
These measures are obtained either from the 
record of the user interaction with the system or 
from user self-reports (see Section 2). 
First, and most important, are measures of 
behavioral intentions and attitude change: (a) 
whether or not the user adopts the new proposed 
alternative, (b) in which position in the Hot List 
she places it, (c) how much she likes it, (d) 
whether or not the user revises the Hot List and 
(e) how much the user likes the objects in the 
Hot List. Second, a measure can be obtained of 
the user's confidence that she has selected the 
best for her in the set of alternatives. Third, a 
measure of argument effectiveness can also be 
derived by explicitly questioning the user at the 
end of the interaction, about the rationale for her 
decision. This can be done either by asking the 
user to justify her decision in a written 
.paragraph, or by asking,the user to :self-report 
for each attribute of the new house how 
important the attribute was in her decision (Olso 
and Zanna 1991). Both methods can provide 
valuable information on what aspects of the 
argument were more influential (i.e., better 
understood and accepted by the user). 
A fourth measure of argument effectiveness is to 
explicitly ask the user at the end of the 
interaction to judge the argument with respect to 
several dimensions of quality, such as content, 
organization, writing style and convincigness. 
Evaluations based on judgments along these 
dimensions are clearly weaker than evaluations 
measuring actual behavioural and attitudinal 
changes (Olso and Zanna 1991). However, these 
judgments may provide more information than 
judgments from independent judges (as in the 
"human judges" method iscussed in Section 3), 
because they are performed by the addressee of 
the argument, when the experience of the task is 
still vivid in her memory. 
To summarize, the evaluation framework just 
described supports users in performing a 
realistic task at their own pace by-interacting 
with an IDEA system. In the context of this task, 
an evaluative argument is generated and 
tneasurements ,related to its effectiveness can be.'  
performed. 
In the next section, we discuss an experiment 
that we are currently running by using the 
evaluation framework.

5 The Exper iment  
As explained in Section 1, the argument 
generator has been designed to facilitate testing 
of the effectiveness of different aspects of the 
generation process. The experimenter can easily 
control whether the generator tailors the 
argument to the current user, the degree of  
conciseness of the argument, and what 
microplanning tasks are performed. In our initial 
experiment, because of  limited financial and 
human resources, we focus on the first two 
aspects for arguments about a single entity. Not 
because we =are not int~ested in  effecti.veness of 
performing microplanning tasks, but because we 
consider effectiveness of  tailoring and 
conciseness somewhat more difficult, and 
therefore more interesting to prove. 
Thus, we designed a between-subjects 
experiment with four experimental conditions: 
No-Argument  - subjects are simply informed that 
a new house came on the market. 
Ta i lo red-Conc ise  - subjects are presented with 
an evaluation of  the new house tailored to their 
preferences and at a level of conciseness that we 
hypothesize to be optimal. 
Non-Ta i lo red-Conc ise  - subjects are presented 
with an evaluation of the new house which is not 
tailored to their preferences 5, but is at a level of 
conciseness that we hypothesize to be optimal. 
Ta i lo red-Verbose  - subjects are presented with 
an evaluation,of the .new- house..tailored to their 
preferences, but at a level of conciseness that we 
hypothesize to be too low. 
s The evaluative argument is tailored to a default 
average user, for whom all aspects of a house are 
equally important.

Figure 4 Excerpt from questionnaire that subjects fill out at the end of-the interaction 
In the four conditions, all the information about 
the new house is also presented graphically. Our 
hypotheses on the outcomes of the experiment 
can be summarized as follows. We expect 
arguments generated for the Tailored-Concise 
condition to be more effective than arguments 
generated for both the Non-Tailored-Concise 
and Tailored-Verbose conditions. We also 
expect the Tailored-Concise condition to be 
somewhat better than the No-Argument 
condititon, but to a lesser extent, because 
subjects, in the absence of any argument, may 
spend more time further exploring the dataset, 
therefore reaching a more informed and 
balanced decision. Finally, we do not have 
strong hypotheses on comparisons of argument 
effectiveness among the No-Argument, Non- 
Tailored-Concise and Tailored-Verbose 
conditions. 
The design of our evaluation framework and 
consequently the design of this experiment take 
into account hat the effectiveness of arguments 
is determined not only by the argument itselK 
but also by user's traits such as 
argumentativeness, need for cognition, self- 
esteem and intelligence (as described in Section 
2). Furthermore, we assume that argument 
effectiveness can be measured by means of the 
behavioral intentions and self-reports described 
in Section 4.2. 
The experiment is organized in two phases.-In 
the first phase, the subject fills out three 
questionnaires on the Web. One questionnaire 
implements a method from decision theory to 
acquire a model of the subject's preferences 
(Edwards and Barton 1994). The second 
questionnaire assesses the subject's 
argumentativeness (lnfante and Rancer 1982). 
The last one assesses the subject's need for 
cognition (Cacioppo, PeW et al 1984). In the 
second phase of the experiment, o control for 
other possible confounding variables (including 
intelligence and self-esteem), the subject is 
randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. 
Then, the subject interacts with the evaluation 
framework and at the end of the interaction 
measures of the argument effectiveness are 
collected. Some details on measures based on 
subjects' self-reports can be examined in Figure 
4, which shows an excerpt from the final 
questionnaire that subjects are asked to fill out at 
the end of the interaction. 
After running the experiment with 8 pilot 
subjects to refine and improve the experimental 
procedure, we are currently running a formal 
experiment involving 40 subjects, I0 in each 
experimental conditions. 
Future  Work  
In this paper, we propose a task-based 
framework to evaluate evaluative arguments. 
We are currently using this framework to run a 
formal experiment to evaluate arguments about a 
single entity. However, this is only a first step. 
The power of the framework is that it enables 
the design and execution of many different 
:experiments . about- evaluative .arguments. The 
goal of our current experiment is to verify 
whether tailoring an evaluative argument to the 
user and varying the degree of argument 
conciseness influence argument effectiveness. 
We envision further experiments along the 
following lines. 
15 
In the short "term, we plan to stcidy more 
complex arguments, including comparisons 
between two entities, as well as comparisons 
between mixtures of  entities and set of  entities. 
One experiment could assess the influence of 
tailoring and conciseness on the effectiveness of
these more complex arguments. Another 
possible experiment could compare different 
. argumentative, strategies for:~ selecting ~and 
organizing the content of these arguments. In the 
long term, we intend to evaluate techniques to 
generate evaluative arguments that combine 
natural anguage and information graphics (e.g., 
maps, tables, charts).
