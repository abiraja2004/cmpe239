Abstract
As the title suggests, our paper deals with web
discussion fora, whose content can be consid-
ered to be a special type of comparable cor-
pora. We discuss the potential of this vast
amount of data available now on the World
Wide Web nearly for every language, regard-
ing both general and common topics as well
as the most obscure and specific ones. To il-
lustrate our ideas, we propose a case study
of seven wedding discussion fora in five lan-
guages.
1 Introduction to comparable corpora
Nearly every description of comparable corpora be-
gins with the EAGLES (Expert Advisory Group on
Language Engineering Standards) definition:1
?A comparable corpus is one which selects simi-
lar texts in more than one language or variety. The
possibilities of a comparable corpus are to com-
pare different languages or varieties in similar cir-
cumstances of communication, but avoiding the in-
evitable distortion introduced by the translations of
a parallel corpus.?
(Maia, 2003), which also became nearly standard
during the recent years, emphasizes the fact that
comparable monolingual corpora usually provide us
with much better linguistic quality and representa-
tiveness than translated parallel corpora. The other
advantages over the parallel corpora, i.e. amount
and availability, are obvious.
Nowadays, the most popular usage of compara-
ble corpora is improving machine translation, more

precisely, compensating the lack of parallel train-
ing data. The articles (Munteanu et al, 2004),
(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) and (Munteanu and
Marcu, 2006) are introducing algorithms for ex-
tracting parallel sentences and sub-sententional frag-
ments from comparable corpora and using the auto-
matically extracted parallel data for improving sta-
tistical machine translation algorithms performance.
Present day most popular comparable corpora
come either from the newswire resources (AFP,
Reuters, Xinhua), leading to data sets like LDC
English, Chinese and Arabic Gigaword, or from
Wikipedia. Mining Wikipedia became very popu-
lar in the recent years. For example, (Toma?s et al,
2008) is exploring both parallel and comparable po-
tential of Wikipedia, (Filatova, 2009) examines mul-
tilingual aspects of a selected subset of Wikipedia
and (Gamallo and Lo?pez, 2010) describes convert-
ing Wikipedia into ?CorpusPedia?.
2 Introduction to fora
Just to avoid confusion: In this article, we focus only
on fora or boards, i.e. standalone discussion sites on
a stated topic. We are not talking about comments
accompanying news articles or blog posts.
The internet discussion fora cover, in surprisingly
big amounts of data and for many languages, the
most unbelievable topics (real examples from the
authors? country). People, who eat only uncooked
(?raw?) food. People, who eat only cooked food.
Mothers with young children, women trying to con-
ceive, communities of people absolutely avoiding
sex. Fans of Volvo, BMW, Maserati, Trabant cars.
Probably also in your country mothers like to talk

about their children and men like to compare their
engine?s horse power.
Everyone who has any specific interest or hobby
and is friendly with the web, probably knows at least
one discussion forum focused on his/her favourite
topic, inhabited by intelligent, friendly debaters pro-
ducing interesting, on-topic content. These types of
fora often have very active administrators, who clean
the discussions from off-topics, vulgarities, move
the discussion threads into correct thematic cate-
gories etc. The administrators? ?tidying up? effort
can be even regarded as a kind of annotation.
The rapidly growing amount of web discussion
fora was until now linguistically exploited only in a
strictly monolingual manner. To the best of our (and
Google Scholar) knowledge, nobody has published
any work regarding the possibility of using internet
discussion fora as a multilingual source of data for
linguistic or machine translation purposes.
2.1 Forum structure
A typical forum is divided into thematic categories
(larger fora split into boards and boards into cate-
gories). Every category usually contains from tens
to thousands of separate discussions. A discussion
consists of messages (posts) and sometimes its con-
tent is further arranged using threads.
A discussion should be placed in appropriate cat-
egory and messages in the discussion should hold
onto the discussion topic, otherwise the administra-
tor removes the inappropriate messages or even the
whole discussion.
Fora usually have an entire off-topic category
where their members can talk about anything ?out-
of-domain?.
To avoid spam, usually only registered members
can contribute. Some fora keep their memberlist vis-
ible to the public, some do not.
3 Why comparable fora?
Besides their amount and availability, comparable
fora have a few other advantages over other types
of comparable corpora.
They contain ?spontaneous writing? ? an original,
previously unpublished content, which is almost cer-
tainly not a translation of other language original.
This is obviously not the case of parallel corpora,
and we cannot be sure even for other popular com-
parable corpora. A journalist may be inspired by a
news agency report or by another media source, and
a Wikipedia author must also reconcile his claims
with existing resources, which more or less affects
his writing style.
The other advantage is easier domain classifi-
cation, or more effective pre-selection before run-
ning an automatic parallel sentences alignment. A
generic newspaper article is provided only with a
title, language and release date. A Wikipedia en-
try has a title, history and is classified into a the-
matic category. Fora messages have both dates, titles
and category classifications and they are available in
much larger amounts than Wikipedia entries and are
covering more thematic domains than news articles.
4 A case study: wedding sites
As a topic of our case study, we have chosen an event
which occurs to most of the people at least once in
their life ? a wedding.
4.1 General overview
We looked over five language mutations of the
same forum operated by Asmira Company ? Fi-
nalstitch.co.uk (EN), Braupunkt.de (DE), Faire-
lanoce.fr (FR), Mojasvadba.sk (SK), Beremese.cz
(CZ); and two other fora, Brides.com/forums (EN2)
and Organisation-mariage.net (FR2), which seem to
be larger and more popular in the target countries.
We have manually examined fora sizes and possi-
bilities of their alignment on the category level.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the total number of dis-
cussions and messages contained in selected cate-
gories, shared by most of the fora. For the Asmira
fora, we omitted the discussions accessible both
from CZ and SK sites.
If we assume average length of a message to be
about 60 words (see below), the proposed sites give
us a few millions of words of multilingual compa-
rable corpora in each category (focussed on very re-
stricted topic, such as wedding clothes, or hairdress-
ing & make-up) even for ?non-mainstream? lan-
guages, such as Czech or Slovak.
4.2 Quantitative characteristics
In order to learn more about the amount and textual
quality of the data, we have downloaded all the con-

tent of the five Asmira fora, extracted their messages
into five monolingual corpora and measured some
basic characteristics of the texts. The downloading
and extracting task needed about 20 minutes of cod-
ing and a few days of waiting for the result (we did
not want to overload the fora webservers).
Table 3 shows us average messages lengths (in
words) for particular categories of these fora.
In graphs 1, 2 and 3, we present normalized sen-
tence length distributions for particular fora. For
English and Czech, we added for comparison sen-
tence length distributions of reference corpora of
comparable sizes, i.e. The Penn Treebank, train-
ing set (Marcus et al, 1994), for English and The
Czech National Corpus, SYN2005 (CNC, 2005), for
Czech.
4.3 Examples of similar discussion topics
The category distinction may be still too coarse for
potential alignment. The site FR2 has a joint cate-
gory for Beauty and Wedding clothing, and on the
contrary, it has separate categories for Wedding and
Reception. Therefore, we tried to examine the fora
on a deeper level. In table 4, we present some exam-
ples of discussions on the same topic.
As you can guess, fully automatic alignment of
the discussion titles will not be an easy task. On the
other side, every machine translation specialist must

5 Technical issues
Of course, language mutations of the same forum
(sharing the same category structure and running on
the same forum engine) are a ?researcher?s dream?
and not the case of the majority of potential compa-
rable fora.
You will probably ask two questions: 1) How to
effectively extract messages from a site with undoc-
umented structure? 2) How to put together compara-
ble fora in multiple languages and how to align their
category hierarchy?
5.1 Messages mining
According to an internet source 2, about 96 % of in-
ternet discussion fora are powered by two most pop-

ular forum systems, phpBB and vBulletin, and an-
other 3 % are powered by Simple Machines Forum,
MyBB and Invision Power Board.
Our observation is, that small hobby fora run
mostly on unadapted (?as is?) phpBB or another free
system, while large commercial fora often have their
own systems.
If you intend to automatically process only a few
selected fora, you will probably use XPath queries
on the HTML Document Object Model. According
to our experience, it is very easy and straightforward
task to write a single wrapper for a particular forum.
But it would be nice, of course, to have a general
solution which does not rely on a fixed forum struc-
ture. Unfortunately, general web page cleaning al-
gorithms, e.g. Victor (Spousta et al, 2008), are not

very succesfull with this type of input (i.e. ten to
fifty rather small textual portions on one page).
However, there are some invariants shared among
all types of fora 3. The content is automatically gen-
erated and therefore all the messages on one page
(can be generalized to one site) usually ?look simi-
lar?, in terms of HTML structure. (Limanto et al,
2005) exploits this fact and introduces a subtree-
matching algorithm for detecting messages on a dis-
cussion page. (Li et al, 2009) proposes more com-
plex algorithm which extracts not only the messages
content but also the user profile information.
5.2 Fora coupling
The task of optimal fora, categories, discussions,
sentences and phrases alignment remains open. Our
article is meant to be an inspiration, thus for now,
we will not provide our reader with any surprising
practical solutions, only with ideas.
The sentence and sub-sentence level can be main-
tained by existing automatic aligners. For the rest,
we believe that combined use of hierarchical struc-
3and some other types of web sites, eg. e-shops or blogs
ture of the fora together with terms, named entities
or simple word translations can help. For example,
nearly every EU top level domain hosts a ?Volvo Fo-
rum? or ?Volvo Club?, and each Volvo Forum con-
tains some portion of discussions mentioning model
names, such as V70 or S60, in their titles.
Besides, according to our case study, the amount
of acquired data compared to the amount of hu-
man effort should be reasonable even when cou-
pling the fora sites and their top categories manu-
ally. Present day approaches to acquiring compara-
ble corpora also require some human knowledge and
effort, e.g. you need to pick out manually the most
reliable and appropriate news resources.
6 Conclusion
We have proposed an idea of using co-existent web
discussion fora in multiple languages addressing the
same topic as comparable corpora. Our case study
shows that using this approach, one can acquire large
portions of comparable multilingual data with min-
imal effort. We also discussed related technical is-
sues.
You may ask, whether the forum language is the
right (addition to a) training set for a machine trans-
lation system. The answer may depend on, what
type of system it is and what type of input do you
want to translate. If you need to translate parliamen-
tary proceedings, you will surely be more satisfied
with parliament-only training data. But do you want
an anything-to-speech machine translation system to
talk to you like a parliamentary speaker, or like a
Wikipedia author, or like a friend of yours from your
favourite community of interest?
We hope that our article drew the attention of the
linguistic audience to this promising source of com-
parable texts and we are looking forward to seeing
some interesting resources and applications.
