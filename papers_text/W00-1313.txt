Abstract 
This paper proposed a new query translation 
method based on the mutual information 
matrices of terms in the Chinese and 
English corpora. Instead of looking up a 
? bilingual phrase dictionary, the 
compositional phrase (the translation of 
phrase can be derived from the translation 
of its components) in the query can be 
indirectly translated via a general-purpose 
Chinese-English dictionary look-up 
procedure. A novel selection method for 
translations of query terms is also presented 
in detail. Our query translation method 
ultimately constructs an English query in 
which each query term has a weight. The 
evaluation results show that the retrieval 
performance achieved by our query 
translation method is about 73% of 
monolingual information retrieval and is 
about 28% higher than that of simple word- 
by-word translation way. 
Introduction 
With the rapid growth of electronic documents 
and the great development of network in China, 
there are more and more people touching the 
Intemet, on which, however, English is the most 
popular language being used. It is difficult for 
most people in China to use English fluently, so 
they would like to use Chinese to express their 
queries to retrieval the relevant English 
documents. This situation motivates research in 
Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). 
There are two approaches to CLIR, one is 
query translation; the other is translating 
original language documents to destination

Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young 
Scholars under contact 69983009. 
language quivalents. Obviously, the latter is a 
very expensive task since there are so many 
documents in a collection and there is not yet a 
reliable machine translation system that can be 
used to process automatically. Most researchers 
are inclined to choose the query translation 
approach \[Oard. (1996)\]. Methods for query 
translation have focused on three areas: the 
employment of machine translation techniques, 
dictionary based translation \[Hull & 
Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft (1996)\], 
parallel or comparable corpora for generating 
a translation model \[Davis & Dunning (1995); 
Sheridan & Ballerini (1996); Nie, Jian-Yun et 
a1.(1999)\]. Machine translation (MT) method 
has many obstacles to prevent its employment 
into CLIR such as deep syntactic and semantic 
analysis, user queries consisting of only one or 
two words, and an arduous task to build a MT 
system. Dictionary based query translation is the 
most popular method because of its easiness to 
perform. The main reasons leading to the great 
drops in CLIP,. effectiveness by this method are 
ambiguities caused by more than one translation 
of a query term and failures to translate phrases 
during query translation. Previous studies \[Hull 
& Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft 
(1996)\] have shown that automatic word-by- 
word (WBW) query translation via machine 
readable dictionary (MKD) results in a 40-60% 
loss in effectiveness below that of monolingual 
retrieval. With regard to the use of parallel 
corpora translation method, the critiques one 
often raises concern the availability of reliable 
parallel text corpora. An alternative way is that 
making use of the comparable corpora because 
they are easier to be obtained and there are more 
and more bilingual even multilingual documents 
on the Internet. From analyzing a document 
collection, an associated word list can be 
yielded and it is often used to expansion the 
query in monolingual information retrieval \[Qiu 
& Frei(1993); Jing & Croft(1994)\]. 
104 
In this paper, a new query translation is 
presented by combination dictionary based 
method with the comparable corpora analyzing. 
Ambiguity problem and phrase information lost 
are attacked in dictionary based Chinese- 
English Cross-Language information Retrieval 
(CECLIR). The remainder of this paper is 
organized as follows: section 1 gives a method 
to calculate the mutual information matrices of 
Chinese-English comparable corpora. Section 2 
develops a scheme to select the translations of 
the Chinese query terms and introduces how the 
compositional phrase can be kept in our method. 
Section 3 presents a set of preliminary 
experiment on comparable corpora to evaluate 
our query translation method and gives some 
explanations. 
1 .Mutual information matrices 
calculation 
We hypothesize that the words in a sentence 
after being removed the stop words be 
associated with each other and work together to 
express a query requirement. The association 
relationship between two words can be 
indicated by their mutual information, which 
can be further used to discover phrases \[Church 
:& Hanks (1990)\]. If two words are independent 
with each other, their mutual information would 
be close to zero. On the other hand, if they are 
strongly related, the mutual information would 
be much greater than zero and they would be 
much like to be a phrase; if they occur 
complementarily, the mutual information would 
be negative. In conclusion? the bigger the 
mutual information of word pair, the more 
probable the word phrase would be a phrase. 
According to \[Fano (1961)\], we can define the 
mutual information M1 (tl,t z) of term t I and 
t z as formula (1). 
MI(q,t2) =log  z P(t~'t2) (1) 
P(t~)P(t2) 
Where 
P(tl, t z) is the co-occurrence probability of 
t~ and t~ in a Chinese sentence. The reason we 
select a Chinese sentence to be a window other 
than a fixed length window is that a full Chinese 
sentence can keep more linguistic information 
and consequently, it is more reasonable that we 
can regard t~ and t 2 to be a phrase when they 
co-occur in a sentence. P(t l) and P(t 2) are 
the occurrence probabilities of term t I and t 2 
in a sentence. These probabilities can be 
calculated by the occurrence of term t~ and t 2 
in the collection as equation (2), (3) and (4). 
P(tl) = n,__~_ (2) 
N 
P(t2) = n,2 (3) 
N 
P(tl, t2 ) = n,,,,~ (4) 
N 
Where 
nt~ , nt2 is the individual term frequency of 
term t I and t 2 respectively if either of them 
occur in a sentence of the collection, ntt,t ~ is 
the co-occurrence frequency of term t I and t 2 
i f  they are all in a sentence of the collection. N 
is the number of sentences of the collection. 
Replacing (1) with equation (2), (3) and (4), the 
mutual information of term t I and t 2 can be 
expressed by following formula. 
n,,. N 
MI(q,t 2) = log 2 '- (5)

Table 2 and table 3 show the occurrence 
frequency values and mutual information values 
calculated by formula (5) for three Chinese 
compositional phrases and their corresponding 
English phrases respectively found in our 
comparable corpora.

Table 3: Mutual information of three English

Anal)zing the Chinese-English comparable 
corpora in this way, we can get two mutual 
information value matrices to indicate which 
two terms (as to the Chinese collection, they are 
105 
almost Chinese words after segmentation) 
would be most possible to be a phrase. A word 
list associated to each Chinese query term can 
be obtained by looking up the mutual 
information value matrix of the Chinese corpus 
with a cutoff of M1 =1.50. As discussed 
above, the bigger the mutual information value 
between two terms, the more possible the two 
words would be a phrase. We can infer that the 
associated word list of the query term contains 
the terms that are the most possible components 
of a compositional phrase. In other words, the 
phrase information can be kept by this way. The 
Chinese query is translated into English via 
looking up the English senses of Chinese query 
term and words in its associated word list in a 
Chinese-English dictionary. The procedures 
how to select appropriate tranlations and to 
construct he English query are discussed in 
section 2. 
2 Translations selection and phrase 
keeping 
It is a naive method to translate a Chinese query 
only by looking up each Chinese term to get its 
English senses in a Chinese-English dictionary. 
This method, however, results in too many 
ambiguities during the query translation and 
offers no path to select appropriate ones among 
the translations. In addition, phrases in the query 
can not be translated effectively. Previous tudy 
has showed that failure to translate phrases 
greatly reduces the performance by up to 25% 
over automatic word-by-word (WBW) query 
translation \[Ballesteros & Croft (1996)\]. 
In our method, those English translations 
most likely co-occur with each other can be 
obtained via looking up the mutual information 
value matrix of the English corpus with a cutoff 
M1 = 1.50. In this way, the English senses of 
terms in the associated word list can provide a 
good context for the translation of the Chinese 
query term and give a significant clue for its 
translations selection. In addition, the 
information of two terms (either Chinese or 
English) to be a phrase can also be stored in the 
associated word list. In the following, we firstly 
describe our method to select translations in 
detail, and then we give an example to 
demonstrate how to keep the phrase information 
in our method. 
Supposing the Chinese query is expressed by 
(e 1 ,e~ ,.--, e, ). el, e2,... , e, are the segmented 
Chinese words of the query after removing the 
stop words. The translations of 
e m (m = 1,...,r)by looking up the Chinese- 
English bilingual dictionary can be ordered in 
descending by following formula. 
W(fm t ) = lOglO(Ot'i_Ml(f ~)+ fl "o_Ml(fm t )) (6) 
l~'llgmkl" t " " 
z z 
i _M i ( fm l ) = k=l j= l  / 
I~llrmkl (7) 
k=l  
r \]~1 l 
Z ZMI(f,~,J~ k) 
o_ MI(fm l ) = i=l,i?m k=l (8) 
r  lYd 
? i=l,i~m 
Where 
f~ is one sense of the English translation set 
F m of the word e,~ (l = 1,...,IF.b g. is the 
association word set of e m . The size of E m is 
le.I and its element is e~ (k = 1 .... ,le.I) 
F~ is the English translation set of emk, its 
element is f,,~. ct is the coefficient to 
emphasize the inner mutual information 
between the English sense f t of the single 
Chinese query term e m and the English sense 
f ,~ of the e m's association word emk. The 
first part of the formula (6) i _M I ( f~)  
reflects the probability of English translation 
f,~ and f ,~ to be a phrase. /3 is the 
coefficient o emphasize the outside mutual 
information between f,~ and the English sense 
~* of the other Chinese terms included in the 
query. The second part of the formula (6) 
o_  Ml ( f~)  reflects the relevant value between 
the English sense f ,~of  e m and the whole 
query concept. 
Our method of translations selection can be 
described as follows: if the weight of any 
translation of the Chinese query term is greater 
than 1.00, the sense is selected to construct the 
English query. If there is no weight of any 
translation of the Chinese query term greater 
than 1.00, the sense with biggest one is selected 
to construct the English query. In this way, we 
can make an English query by the following 
Boolean expression. 
106 
r / I F~I .  t "~ Query =21\[ XI ~glra'W(gra))) (9) 
Where o I is set element after the English Ora  
translation sense set F m which is detruncated 
by our translation selection method. 
In order to demonstrate he procedure of our 
method, we give an example and explain how 
the English translations are selected and how the 
phrase information is kept. Given a simple 
Chinese query " ~ fi' , '~ ~ , ~ ~ (user, 
management, command)" after segmentation 
and removing stop words, the associated word 
list of term " ~ ~ (user)" is " '~" 2~ 
(management) , 4-~ ,~ (information) , --f- ~" 
(manual)" and the associated word list of term 
"'~ ~E(management)" is "~ ~ (user), *J~(harrd 
disk), ~,Aq-(file)". We process the associated 
word "'~2~2(management)" of the query term 
"~q ~ (user)" in a special way by adding an 
appropriate value to their mutual information 
value to let theirs be the biggest in the 
associated word list, because the associated 
word " '~(management)"  also occurs in the 
original query. Similar way is done with the 
associated word "~ ~ (user)" of the query term 
"~ ~ (management)". In this way, , the 
compositional phrase " h~ ~ '~ JX (user 
management)" can be kept in both associated 
word list of term " I t / "  (user)" and term "~X 
(management)". 
When term ")~ ~"  is translated into English 
by looking up the general-purpose Chinese- 
English bilingual dictionary, we get its English 
sense set "user, consumer" ordered by the 
formula (6). When term "~'JE" is translated 
into English, we get its English sense set 
"management, administration, supervision, run" 
ordered by the formula (6). We can fred the first 
positions of the English translation set of the 
query term "~ P"  and term '"~'JX" are "user" 
and "management" respectively. From the point 
of view of translation, the phrase "user 
management" can be regarded as the English 
phrase translation of "~ # '~ ~" .  According to 
our translation selection and formula (9), we can 
construct the English Boolean query as follows, 
in which each query term has a weight. 
Query = (user, 1.86)and ((management, 1.83) 
or (administration, 1.63)) and (command, 1.92). 
3 Evaluation and discussion 
To evaluate our query translation method, we 
did a set of experiment to compare it to the 
word-by-word (WBW) translation method and 
manual translation method. In the word-by- 
word translation method, the Chinese queries 
are automatically segmented and the Chinese 
terms included in them are translated into 
English only by looking up the general-purpose 
Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. In the 
manual translation method, the Chinese queries 
are translated into English by a Ph.D. student. 
The segmentation we used is based on a small 
general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual 
dictionary that only contains 46,570 pairs in 
which each Chinese word has several English 
translations. The forward and backward 
maximum matching algorithm is used to 
segment he texts and find the combinatorial 
ambiguities. Of all the combinatorial 
ambiguities, 91.2% are removed with the word 
uni-gram prior probabilities. A stop word list of 
1210 elements is set up, which contains 
frequently used functional words as well as 
symbols \[Du & Sun (2000)\]. Our Chinese query 
translation process contains following steps: 
(1) Segment the Chinese query according to the 
method introduced above. 
(2) Get the associated word list of each Chinese 
term included in the query from the Chinese 
mutual information matrix. 
(3) Look up the English sense set of each 
Chinese term and its associated word in the 
general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual 
dictionary. 
(4) Select the English translation sense by the 
method introduced in section 2 (in formula 
(6) the coefficents tx and fl are selected 
by 1.0 and 0.5 respectively in our 
experiment) and construct the English query 
on the basis of the formula (9). 
The document collection used in our 
experiments consists of several Chinese and 
corresponding English computer manuals, 
which include Linux-HOWTO, PostgreSQL 
handbook, Mysql handbook, Linux kernel* and 
Linux Gazette 17 volumes (from July, 1998 to 
Dec., 1999)". In order get a large number 
document Chinese and English collections, we 
decomposed these manuals and let every 
document no more than 15 sentences. As a

result, Chinese-English bilingual comparable 
corpora are obtained in which contain about 
8,200 Chinese documents and 12,500 English 
documents. We design 13 Chinese queries, the 
average length is about 7 single Chinese 
character (about hree Chinese words). All work 
in this study was performed on the Search2000 
information retrieval system \[Du & Zhang 
(2000)\], which can process both Chinese and 
English Boolean queries. 
Table 4 shows the precision and recall table for 
the three methods. The first column in table 4 
contains precision values averaged 13 queries and 
interpolated to eleven recall points from 0.0 to 1.0 
in steps of 0.1. The third column contains 
precision values achieved by our translation 
method (QT).

Table 4: The results of the three methods 
The results in table 4 suggest that in this case, 
the WBW query translation leads to a great drop 
in effectiveness of 42.90% below that for 
monolingual retrieval (manual translation 
method). The result of our query translation 
method greatly improves effectiveness by 
28.22% over the WBW method, and its 
effectiveness is about 73.21% of that for 
monolingual retrieval. Although phrase 
translation is not executed directly in our 
method, the phrase information is kept 
effectively in the associated word list. Therefore, 
the phrase can be well ~anslated. The associated 
word list also provides a good context for 
translation of the Chinese query terms 
(corresponding to the first part of formula (6) 
i _Ml ( f~t) )  and a good English translation is 
given a relatively high weight. The results in 
table 4 show that our query translation method 
can construct a good English query and indeed 
improve the effectiveness. 
Conclusion 
Automatic word-by-word query translation is an 
attractive method because it is easy to perform, 
resources are readily available, and performance 
is similar to that of other CLIP,. methods. 
However, there are a lot of ambiguities in 
translation of the query terms and failures to 
translate phrases correctly, which are mainly 
responsible for the large drops in effectiveness 
below monolingual retrieval performance. 
Aiming to tackle with these problems, we 
develop a new scheme for how to select 
translations in this paper. In addition, rather than 
using a bilingual phrase dictionary, we also put 
forward a new method to translate phrases 
indirectly by using the mutual information 
between two words in a full sentence and keep 
the phrase information in the associated word 
list effectively. As a result of our query 
translation method, an English query is 
constructed in which each query term has a 
weight. 
In this study, our method leads to improve 
the effectiveness by 28.22% over the word by 
word query translation method, but is still about 
27% below the monolingual retrieval 
performance. If query expansion is employed in 
our method, we expect he performance should 
be further improved. A shortcoming of our 
method is that the cost of calculation of the 
mutual information matrices is very large. We 
are currently exploring an algorithm to generate 
the matrices more efficiently and the selection 
of coefficients in formula (6) also needs further 
research.
