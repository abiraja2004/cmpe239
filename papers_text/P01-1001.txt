Abstract
The 3 billion base pair sequence of the human genome is now available, and attention is focusing on
annotating it to extract biological meaning.  I will discuss what we have obtained, and the methods
that are being used to analyse biological sequences.  In particular I will discuss approaches using
stochastic grammars analogous to those used in computational linguistics, both for gene finding and
protein family classification.
