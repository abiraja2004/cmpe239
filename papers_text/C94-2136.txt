ple smm'nce (ca.lied logk:al ,,nits) is recognized. When 
more than two siml)lc sentences(cla, uses) ,,re extracted, 
847 
they are transferred to complex sentence conversion 
based on user detlnable complex sentence J /E  transla- 
tion patterns. 
TWP can make user reach a target English by their 
monitoring and controlling Japanese-English conver- 
sion process~ so that they can feel content with each 
step of every interactive assistances or automatic pro- 
cesses. It can also save key strokes for arranging word 
order as it generates English expressions in a correct 
word order by conversion capability of a phras% a sin> 
pie sentence and a complex sentence, besides word 
level dictionary consultation facility. TWP also has 
proposed a protocol to eliminate redundant user key 
strokes for selecting menu or commanding process by 
default reasoning to guess user's next stroke. This 
means that no other key strokes are sometimes nec- 
essary than those for inputting Japanese sentences, as 
transh~tion is over at the same time of that a period of 
a Japanese sentence is keyed-in on a screen. 
Whenever any error of conversion is found while in- 
putting Japanese, any step during the conversion can 
be cancelled and corrected by adopting the second al- 
ternative automatically based on key stroke history 
learning mechanism. A cheap cancel and undo proto- 
col is the key issue to make the best use of each default 
reasoning of TWP system, because strokes to select 
correct one after cancels and undos are the sources for 
tuning up default reasoning by learning mechanism. 
2 What  is considered of for 
comfortable usabil ity? 
TWP brings about both users' contentment with func- 
tions that machine translation has failed to realize, 
and large cost reduction ibr sentence generation in tar- 
get language that simple dictionary consultation facil- 
ity has not fulfilled. No other system has ever been 
presented to satisfy two of them at the same time. 
Machine translation system takes no hmnan cost if 
complete translation is acquired. If any errors occur, 
however, manual re-translation or post-editing charges 
vast amount of expense. Post-editors have reported so 
many time high stress by repetitious or utterly unex- 
pected errors machine translation caused. Moreover, 
even when they use Japanese-English automatic trans- 
lation system~ they are required to comprehend both 
languages in reality. Experience of using dictionary 
consultation facilities and grammar checkers tells us 
that such assistance as bilingual dictionary reference, 
sample sentence reference and grammatical check does 
not contribute so much to efficiency of translation and 
that the key operation cost taken to call those func- 
tions, e.g. key strokes, is essentially no less than that 
in case of consulting paper dictionaries. 
TWP peribrms automatic recognition of a word, a 
phrase, and a simple sentence, and immediately af- 
ter that, successive conversion based on bilingual word 
dictionary ~ and simple phrase and simple sentence 
translation functim, is executed. These recognition, 
and conversion processes are supervised by the user 
in the course of inputting Japanese text. TWP users 
reserve the means of cancelling and resolving the er- 
rors that the recognition or conversion created. TWP 
makes users feel content with processes on a screen by 
confirming every step of translation with their eyes. 
TWP supports so much easy use of dictionary con- 
sultation facility in such a manner that either English 
and Japanese word on a cursor position is interpreted 
as a key word for looking up word and bilingual dic- 
tionaries, and is transferred any time automatically to 
consultation facility to retrieve and display the dictio- 
nary data on a pull-down window. Users need not to 
take a special dictionary look up procedure. 
It assists longer sentence gener,~tion i English word 
order by J /E  conversion using complex sentence trans- 
lation patterns defined by users\[5\], as well as using a 
phrase and a simple sentence translation facility. 
In the following chapter~ we explain the overview of 
TWP; English producing support system at first then 
talk about Japanese-to-English interactive conversion 
framework for comfortable English composition in par- 
ticular. 
3 Which Resources support 
English Composi t ion ? 
TWP for English composition support is constructed 
fl'om well understood and transparent resources and 
mechanisms under an extended, what is called, Kana- 
Kanji convcrsion user interface. The noble feature 
of tile (PWP iutroduced hereafter~ is of great trans- 
parency in every 1)rocess of support mechanism. ~l'he 
traceability of process and the controllability of the 
TWP based on default reasoning mechanism in recog- 
nition and conversion of logical units in Japanese in- 
put, and cheap cancellability of wrong steps selected 
by TWP or a user are a noble part of invention which 
supports a great cost reduction of English production 
on Japanese word processors with full of contentment. 
The characteristics of TWP is summarized as fol- 
lows. 
1. Japanese to English conversion interface simulat- 
ing Kana-Kanji Conversion helps an user to learn 
so easily\[i, 3, 41. 
2. User controllable complex sentence transla- 
tion pattern based cortversion achieves transla- 
tion transparency even in long sentence J /E  
conversion\[5, 8, 9\]. 
3. Automatic le~rning feature based on user key 
stroke history covers learnings for translation dis- 
ambiguations ofwords, verb phrases, complex sen- 
tential conversion patterns, etc\[6\]. 
4. It is fully equipped with consultation facilities of 
translation ex~rnples, word dictionaries, bilingual 
848 
dictionaries and so on.

10igure 1. The conligur~t.ion of TWP 
The cot,version of 2Ial)anese i~,to English exi)res- 
sion starts here with determination of scope to convert 
into English. The sequences of key strokes are trans- 
ft.'fred 1;o morl)hoh)gical processing fttnction tbr detect- 
ing logical units like words, phrases, cla.uses, etc. Any 
,I/E conversion of each unit is carted out easily with 
MT subset of I?\]IV()T ;I/l'; transla.tion system ;ts ;~ l)~ck 
end translat.or. 
The .~;trnct;ure editor (\[de;d?) on a robust .\]al)a:tese 
morphological processing function detects .'lap~umse 
logical unit,; a,nd keeps every strokes a.nd every pro 
cesses, during editing , conversion (trlmslation), dic- 
tionary look up etc., in order ti)r user to back to any 
1)oint from lmexpected result in English production by 
cancelling ctmh preceding st,rokes +rod processes. 
The c;u,celling l)rotocol between man and computer 
plays a. gre~vt role of providing users with the most 
eomfort.abk; operationtd)ility, which is backed up by 
the high traltSl>a.rency of system process. 
The transl>arency introduced here is (:mnl)osed of 
two aspects; 1) hiding primitive mechanical steps from 
a. screel, a.l,d showing ev(.u'y and only logical unit level 
stei)s of edit and conversion on a, screen, 2) letting e.ven 
phrase, clsa:se .I/1'; conversion to look like Kan;t-Kanji 
conversioi, to casuM users. 'l'h(~ similarity of user in- 
terface 1)rotocol ()i' the one we. propose here and the 
widely a.cknowh'dged Kana.-Kan.ii c(mversion interf~ce

4 TWP operat ion  and  process  
4 .1  What  meets  casua l  user ' s  requ l rc -  
I ncnt?  
There is ;L big ditl'(~rence between J /E  conversion and 
Kam>Kanji  conversion. The former requires tructural 
trar, sform;~tion like word order transformation, struc- 
tural reduction or exi)anslon , and so on, while the lat- 
ter only him(lies a Ka.na sequm,ce to produce it kanji 
sequence without any modification of the word order 
in a sentence. The fully automatic machine transh~- 
tion system c~m 1)reduce English transl;~tions of input 
,lapanese sentences, by milking word to word trans- 
lation, 1)hrase to phrase structured translation, el,rose 
to clause structurM tr+msh~tion, etc. at once within a 
second. User ha.s no chance to see what hal)pens in a 
travslatiov system, so she gets lost at a glance of the 
meaningless eque.nces of word fragInents and gets em- 
barrassesl in front of pairs of sound a~panese sentence 
~uM miser+title Fnglish output in case of failure in 1tier - 
ticulax. She, fbr ex~mq)le, a student in a. colh,.ge, even if 
she would like to h~ve a sort of help R)r English conlpo- 
sition, never try to use ~t Mg.' ~s ~ tool ag~dn, after she 
incident~dly ha~ had .~n experience to sit beside those 
kinds of unconceivable screen outputs. A person like 
her usually has :~ fltndament~d grammatlc~d and lexlc,tl 
kuowledge, tbr rc+~ding a te?tbook of English compost-- 
:ion. She needs to be able tit imp@he how computer 
works and what it i)roduces, before she starts to learn 
the operations. 
TWP does have. a very limited ~md robust c~q)~bility 
of auto:ha.tic transl~ttio:, witl, a variety of ~mcessories 
inch:din E a. relialfle text book function, an useflfl dic- 
tionary function, an easily a ccessibh; wording examples 
(l~tt~d)ase, tc. as well. It ha.s been designed for a help 
for Japanese. who has basic skill of writing English. 
Some of those persons(Group A) who compose En- 
glish need +t very slight help like English dictionary 
h)okup facility, some others(Group B) need a help 
like vi~rious consulting supports of bilingual dictionary, 
word sense detinitions, transl~tion examples, English 
g:':Unlnar text books etc., the others(Group C) need 
a, pe.rfect hell). 'I?WP helps Group A and (_4roup B 
mainly who work on aal);mese word processor and F,n- 
glish word processor for English production. They 
need very cheap, timely, comfort;~ble support, and do 
not want perfect, exl)ensive supl)ort necessarily. 
A. comfortable support in English composition on 
word processors includes the folh)wings at least. 
1.. limlted but sound translation fimility if awdh~ble, 
2. ~ w~riety of word, 1)ilingual, idiom , and wording

sponse to every key or mouse strokes,

fbre user mentions it, 
Y. Ea.sy recovery to the preceding screen from any 
unexpected result on a screen with no anxiety, 
8. System controllability based on system trans- 
parency. 
The point 1. of simple and fast translation capability 
atfords to the point 4. and the point 8. transparency. 
The points 2. and 3. very simple and fast executable 
retrieving function support the point 4. the point 7. 
and very much the point 8. The points 4. through 
8. are explicated here from now on. 
Whenever TWP finds Japanese word en(l, phrase 
end or clause end, the translation equiwdent is dis- 
played on a screen line for inputting Japanese. J /E  
conversion eeds scope determination of phrases and 
clauses. The TWP iterates scope determination and 
conversion very explicitly on a screen for realising 
traceability and transparency of translation. 
Two issues are left necessary to explain fllrther. 
1. How to determine a scope of conw',rsion ? 
2. tIow to lind an appropriate type. of conversion ?
The tlgure 2 of intuitive image of J /E  conversion 
depicts the two issues more clearly. 
4.2 How to al ign a sequence  of  conver-  
s ion step ? 
The scope determination tbr conversion is one of key 
issues to specify eemfortable user interfa.ce. The con~ 
version should be carried out successfully at any case. 
()therwise, users cannot rely on the conversion support 
and have anxiety of operation. The sequence of con- 
version steps shouhl also be Lraceable within a limited 
human's eye capacity, that is to say, which conversion 
scope selected by TWP should be able to guess, and 
what sequence of conversions also should be foresee- 
M)le. User can catch up with every proce.ss very easily 
if user conhl expect ew'xy kind of change on a screen. 
TWP's idea to resolve user's anxiety (:ome.s from the 
above observation, to afford to the items 4. and 8. 
above greatly. 
There are two reasonable scope interpretations for 
J /E  conversion on the screen1 where a cursor stays 
just after a Japanese string ~}~tNJ(~ which is con> 
posed of two Japanese phrases (bunsetsuis),\[*J,:I , }g: 
Subject-marker,"I is the head of this u.oun phrase 
"bunsetsu\],\[~3~: paper, ~:Object-marker, 'paper is 
the head of this noun phrase" bunsetsu\]. One. of the

;English word order has been produced 
by simple sentence(clause) conversion 
SM: subject-marker 
OM: object-marker 
Figure 2. Stepwise Japanese-English conversion 
alternative scopes is "~L t?~ ?3 C(cursor)", and the 
other is "~ gc C". 
TWP adopts such a simple strategy as a scope tbr 
conversion is the biggest logical unit of words, phrases, 
and clauses just adjacent o C(cursor) on the left part 
of input line. This strategy comes from Japanese in- 
trinsic linguistic structure called head final. 
Whenever an input is don% it is transihrred to mor- 
phological processing to find logical units like word, 
phrase, and clause. A logical unit is handed to J /E  
conversion function to produce English equivalent. 
Japanese logical unit has a head word in the right most 
part of it usually so that every end of Japanese unit is 
guessed much easier than that of Fnglish. Fortunately 
popular and robust algorithm of detectivg end of unit 
is widely known and it looks Mmad one word or one 
phrase to decide whether string on the left of cursor 
is on the end or not. In practice, TWP may recognize 
the end of unit more easily by hearing unit end signMs 
fi'om Kana-kanji conversion stroke as well. 
TWP can gness scope of logical unit with high preci- 
sion accordingly. The screen1 and screen2 in the figure 
3 shows a selected conversion scope is the left smallest 
phrase(bunsetsu) which is usually signMed by kana- 
hn j i  conversion key stroke. 
4.3 S imulated  Mode of Automat ic  J /E  
Convers ion  
The "look ahead" algorithm detecting conversion 
scope by finding logical unit described above is also 
usable in another way. An already guessed logical unit 
850 
~djacent {) a string on ~ cursor is llnally recognized 
as i~ logical unit a.ul;oma%icaily if the string {)it tile cur- 
sot couhl be guessed as a logical unit,. This is calhBd a 
"delayed" type of look Mw.ad algorithm to finding lug- 
ical l)ttnsc|;sll units ,which frees users from inputting 
logical unit end siEna.Is when input is disl}layed frmn 
left t{} right {}it a, screen line. This algorithm pernfits 
a,n ~ml;oma.tic detection of \]ogicM units tbr {:onversion.

The window w2 is opened with "essay" as a key in 
the pull-down window wl for further information of 
the word "essay". The window w3 has been opened 
with "paper as a. key in wJ.. Lexical inf()rmation on w2 
and w3 comes from conventional 1oilingual dictionar- 
ies. Any word in w2 or w3 ca.n be selected for a key of 
dictionary look-up. 
5 Conc lus ion  
TWP brings about both users ~ contentment with tim(:- 
tions that machine translation has failed to realize, and 
large cost reduction for sentence generation in target 
la.ngu~ge that simple dictionary consultation facility 
has not fulfilled. No other system has ever been pre- 
sented to satisfy two of them at the same time. 
TWP users reserve the means of cancelling and re- 
solving the errors that the ~rWP or users created. 
TWP makes users feel content with processes on a 
screen by confirming every step of translation with 
their eyes. These hell) them to use it so easy with 
no anxiety.
