Abstract
This paper describes our submission to
the WMT10 Shared Evaluation Task and
MetricsMATR10. We present a version
of the METEOR-NEXT metric with para-
phrase tables for five target languages. We
describe the creation of these paraphrase
tables and conduct a tuning experiment
that demonstrates consistent improvement
across all languages over baseline ver-
sions of the metric without paraphrase re-
sources.
1 Introduction
Workshops such as WMT (Callison-Burch et al,
2009) and MetricsMATR (Przybocki et al, 2008)
focus on the need for accurate automatic met-
rics for evaluating the quality of machine transla-
tion (MT) output. While these workshops evalu-
ate metric performance on many target languages,
most metrics are limited to English due to the rel-
ative lack of lexical resources for other languages.
This paper describes a language-independent
method for adding paraphrase support to the
METEOR-NEXT metric for all WMT10 target lan-
guages. Taking advantage of the large parallel cor-
pora released for the translation tasks often accom-
panying evaluation tasks, we automatically con-
struct paraphrase tables using the pivot method
(Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005). We use the
WMT09 human evaluation data to tune versions
of METEOR-NEXT with and without paraphrases
and report significantly better performance for ver-
sions with paraphrase support.
2 The METEOR-NEXT Metric
The METEOR-NEXT metric (Denkowski and
Lavie, 2010) evaluates a machine translation hy-
pothesis against a reference translation by calcu-
lating a similarity score based on an alignment be-
tween the two strings. When multiple references
are provided, the hypothesis is scored against each
and the reference producing the highest score is
used. Alignments are formed in two stages: search
space construction and alignment selection.
For a single hypothesis-reference pair, the space
of possible alignments is constructed by identify-
ing all possible word and phrase matches between
the strings according to the following matchers:
Exact: Words are matched if and only if their sur-
face forms are identical.
Stem: Words are stemmed using a language-
appropriate Snowball Stemmer (Porter, 2001) and
matched if the stems are identical.
Synonym: Words are matched if they are both
members of a synonym set according to the Word-
Net (Miller and Fellbaum, 2007) database.
Paraphrase: Phrases are matched if they are
listed as paraphrases in a paraphrase table. The
tables used are described in Section 3.
Previously, full support has been limited to En-
glish, with French, German, and Spanish having
exact and stem match support only, and Czech
having exact match support only.
Although the exact, stem, and synonym match-
ers identify word matches while the paraphrase
matcher identifies phrase matches, all matches can
be generalized to phrase matches with a start po-
sition and phrase length in each string. A word
occurring less than length positions after a match
start is considered covered by the match. Ex-
act, stem, and synonym matches always cover one
word in each string.
Once the search space is constructed, the final
alignment is identified as the largest possible sub-
set of all matches meeting the following criteria in
order of importance:
1. Each word in each sentence is covered by
zero or one matches
2. Largest number of covered words across both
339
sentences
3. Smallest number of chunks, where a chunk
is defined as a series of matched phrases that
is contiguous and identically ordered in both
sentences
4. Smallest sum of absolute distances between
match start positions in the two sentences
(prefer to align words and phrases that occur
at similar positions in both sentences)
Once an alignment is selected, the METEOR-
NEXT score is calculated as follows. The num-
ber of words in the translation hypothesis (t) and
reference (r) are counted. For each of the match-
ers (mi), count the number of words covered by
matches of this type in the hypothesis (mi(t)) and
reference (mi(r)) and apply matcher weight (wi).
The weighted Precision and Recall are then calcu-
lated:
P =
?
iwi ?mi(t)
|t|
R =
?
iwi ?mi(r)
|r|
The parameterized harmonic mean of P and R
(van Rijsbergen, 1979) is then calculated:
Fmean =
P ?R
? ? P + (1? ?) ?R
To account for gaps and differences in word or-
der, a fragmentation penalty (Lavie and Agar-
wal, 2007) is calculated using the total number of
matched words (m) and number of chunks (ch):
Pen = ? ?
(
ch
m
)?
The final METEOR-NEXT score is then calculated:
Score = (1? Pen) ? Fmean
The parameters ?, ?, ?, and wi...wn can be
tuned to maximize correlation with various types
of human judgments.
3 The METEOR Paraphrase Tables
To extend support for WMT10 target languages,
we use released parallel corpora to construct para-
phrase tables for English, Czech, German, Span-
ish, and French. These tables are used by the
METEOR-NEXT paraphrase matcher to identify
additional phrase matches in each language.
3.1 Paraphrasing with Parallel Corpora
Following Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005),
we extract paraphrases automatically from bilin-
gual corpora using a pivot phrase method. For a
given language pair, word alignment, phrase ex-
traction, and phrase scoring are conducted on par-
allel corpora to build a single bilingual phrase ta-
ble for the language pair. For each native phrase
(n1) in the table, we identify each foreign phrase
(f ) that translates n1. Each alternate native phrase
(n2 6= n1) that translates f is considered a para-
phrase of n1 with probability P (f |n1) ? P (n2|f).
The total probability of n2 paraphrasing n1 is
given as the sum over all f :
P (n2|n1) =
?
f
P (f |n1) ? P (n2|f)
The same method can be used to identify foreign
paraphrases (f1, f2) given native pivot phrases
n. To merge same-language paraphrases ex-
tracted from different parallel corpora, we take the
mean of the corpus-specific paraphrase probabili-
ties (PC) weighted by the size of the corpora (C)
used for paraphrase extraction:
P (n2|n1) =
?
C |C| ? PC(n2|n1)?
C |C|
To improve paraphrase accuracy, we apply mul-
tiple filtering techniques during paraphrase extrac-
tion. The following are applied to each paraphrase
instance (n1, f, n2):
1. Discard paraphrases with very low probabil-
ity (P (f |n1) ? P (n2|f) < 0.001)
2. Discard paraphrases for which n1, f , or n2
contain any punctuation characters.
3. Discard paraphrases for which n1, f , or
n2 contain only common words. Common
words are defined as having relative fre-
quency of 0.001 or greater in the parallel cor-
pus.
Remaining phrase instances are summed to con-
struct corpus-specific paraphrase tables. Same-
language paraphrase tables are selectively merged
as part of the tuning process described in Sec-
tion 4.2. Final paraphrase tables are further fil-
tered to include only paraphrases with probabili-
ties above a final threshold (0.01).

3.2 Available Data
We conduct paraphrase extraction using parallel
corpora released for the WMT10 Shared Trans-
lation Task. This includes Europarl corpora
(French-English, Spanish-English, and German-
English), news commentary (French-English,
Spanish-English, German-English, and Czech-
English), United Nations corpora (French-English
and Spanish-English), and the CzEng (Bojar and
Z?abokrtsky?, 2009) corpus sections 0-8 (Czech-
English). In addition, we use the German-Spanish
Europarl corpus released for WMT08 (Callison-
Burch et al, 2008).
3.3 Paraphrase Table Construction
Using all available data for each language pair,
we create bilingual phrase tables for the follow-
ing: French-English, Spanish-English, German-
English, Czech-English, and German-Spanish.
The full training corpora and resulting phrase ta-
bles are described in Table 1. For each phrase ta-
ble, both foreign and native paraphrases are ex-
tracted. Same-language paraphrases are selec-
tively merged as described in Section 4.2 to pro-
duce the final paraphrase tables described in Ta-
ble 2. To keep table size reasonable, we only ex-
tract paraphrases for phrases occurring in target
corpora consisting of the pooled development data
from the WMT08, WMT09, and WMT10 trans-
lation tasks (10,158 sentences for Czech, 20,258
sentences for all other languages).

4 Tuning METEOR-NEXT
4.1 Development Data
As part of the WMT10 Shared Evaluation Task,
data from WMT09 (Callison-Burch et al, 2009),
including system output, reference translations,
and human judgments, is available for metric de-
velopment. As metrics are evaluated primarily
on their ability to rank system output on the seg-
ment level, we select the human ranking judg-
ments from WMT09 as our development set (de-
scribed in Table 3).
4.2 Tuning Procedure
Tuning a version of METEOR-NEXT consists of
selecting parameters (?, ?, ?, wi...wn) that opti-
mize an objective function for a given language.
If multiple paraphrase tables exist for a language,
tuning also requires selecting the optimal set of ta-
bles to merge.
For WMT10, we tune to rank consistency on the
WMT09 data. Following Callison-Burch et. al
(2009), we discard judgments where system out-
puts are deemed equivalent and calculate the pro-
portion of remaining judgments preserved when
system outputs are ranked by automatic metric
scores. For each target language, tuning is con-
ducted as an exhaustive grid search over metric pa-
rameters and possible paraphrase tables, resulting
in global optima for both.
5 Experiments
To evaluate the impact of our paraphrase ta-
bles on metric performance, we tune versions of
METEOR-NEXT with and without the paraphrase
matchers for each language. For further compar-
ison, we tune a version of METEOR-NEXT using
the TERp English paraphrase table (Snover et al,
2009) used by previous versions of the metric.
As shown in Table 4, the addition of paraphrases
leads to a better tuning point for every target lan-
guage. The best scoring subset of paraphrase ta-

Table 4: Optimal METEOR-NEXT parameters with and without paraphrases for WMT10 target languages
bles for English also outperforms the TERp para-
phrase table.
Analysis of the phrase matches contributed by
the paraphrase matchers reveals an interesting
point about the task of paraphrasing for MT eval-
uation. Despite filtering techniques, the final para-
phrase tables include some unusual, inaccurate,
or highly context-dependent paraphrases. How-
ever, the vast majority of matches identified be-
tween actual system output and reference trans-
lations correspond to valid paraphrases. In many
cases, the evaluation task itself acts as a final filter;
to produce a phrase that can match a spurious para-
phrase, not only must a MT system produce incor-
rect output, but it must produce output that over-
laps exactly with an obscure paraphrase of some
phrase in the reference translation. As systems
are far more likely to produce phrases with similar
words to those in reference translations, far more
valid paraphrases exist in typical system output.
6 Conclusions
We have presented versions of METEOR-NEXT
and paraphrase tables for five target languages.
Tuning experiments indicate consistent improve-
ments across all languages over baseline versions
of the metric. Created for MT evaluation, the ME-
TEOR paraphrase tables can also be used for other
tasks in MT and natural language processing. Fur-
ther, the techniques used to build the paraphrase
tables are language-independent and can be used
to improve evaluation support for other target lan-
guages. METEOR-NEXT, the METEOR paraphrase
tables, and the software used to generate para-
phrases are released under an open source license
and made available via the METEOR website.
