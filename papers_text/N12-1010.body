Abstract
We present a model for detecting user dis-
engagement during spoken dialogue interac-
tions. Intrinsic evaluation of our model (i.e.,
with respect to a gold standard) yields results
on par with prior work. However, since our
goal is immediate implementation in a sys-
tem that already detects and adapts to user un-
certainty, we go further than prior work and
present an extrinsic evaluation of our model
(i.e., with respect to the real-world task). Cor-
relation analyses show crucially that our au-
tomatic disengagement labels correlate with
system performance in the same way as the
gold standard (manual) labels, while regres-
sion analyses show that detecting user disen-
gagement adds value over and above detecting
only user uncertainty when modeling perfor-
mance. Our results suggest that automatically
detecting and adapting to user disengagement
has the potential to significantly improve per-
formance even in the presence of noise, when
compared with only adapting to one affective
state or ignoring affect entirely.
1 Introduction
Spoken dialogue systems that can detect and adapt
to user affect1 are fast becoming reality (Schuller
et al., 2009b; Batliner et al., 2008; Prendinger and
Ishizuka, 2005; Vidrascu and Devillers, 2005; Lee
?Now at Univ. Toronto: jdrummond@cs.toronto.edu
1We use affect for emotions and attitudes that affect how
users communicate. Other speech researchers also combine
concepts of emotion, arousal, and attitudes where emotion is
not full-blown (Cowie and Cornelius, 2003).
and Narayanan, 2005; Shafran et al., 2003). The
benefits are clear: affect-adaptive systems have been
shown to increase task success (Forbes-Riley and
Litman, 2011a; D?Mello et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2008) or improve other system performance met-
rics such as user satisfaction (Liu and Picard, 2005;
Klein et al., 2002). However, to date most affec-
tive systems researchers have focused either only on
affect detection, or only on detecting and adapting
to a single affective state. The next step is thus to
develop and evaluate spoken dialogue systems that
detect and respond to multiple affective states.
We previously showed that detecting and re-
sponding to user uncertainty during spoken dialogue
computer tutoring significantly improves task suc-
cess (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a). We are
now taking the next step: incorporating automatic
detection and adaptation to user disengagement as
well, with the goal of further improving task suc-
cess. We targeted user uncertainty and disengage-
ment because manual annotation showed them to be
the two most common user affective states in our
system and both are negatively correlated with task
success (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2009; Forbes-
Riley and Litman, 2011b). Thus, we hypothesize
that providing appropriate responses to these states
would reduce their frequency, consequently improv-
ing task success. Although we address these user
states in the tutoring domain, spoken dialogue re-
searchers across domains and applications have in-
vestigated the automatic detection of both user un-
certainty (e.g. (Drummond and Litman, 2011; Pon-
Barry and Shieber, 2011; Paek and Ju, 2008; Alwan
et al., 2007)) and user disengagement (e.g., (Schuller
91
et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Schuller
et al., 2009a)), to improve system performance.
The detection of user disengagement in particular
has received substantial attention in recent years,
due to growing awareness of its potential for neg-
atively impacting commercial applications (Wang
and Hirschberg, 2011; Schuller et al., 2009a).
In this paper we present a model for automati-
cally detecting user disengagement during spoken
dialogue interactions. Intrinsic evaluation of our
model yields results on par with those of prior work.
However, we argue that while intrinsic evaluations
are necessary, they aren?t sufficient when immedi-
ate implementation is the goal, because there is no a
priori way to know when the model?s performance is
acceptable to use in a working system. This problem
is particularly relevant to affect detection because it
is such a difficult task, where no one achieves near-
perfect results. We argue that for such tasks some
extrinsic evaluation is also necessary, to show that
the automatic labels are useful and/or are a reason-
able substitute for a gold standard before undertak-
ing a labor-intensive and time-consuming evaluation
with real users. Here we use correlational analy-
ses to show that our automatic disengagement la-
bels are related to system performance in the same
way as the gold standard (manual) labels. We fur-
ther show through regression analyses that detecting
user disengagement adds value over and above de-
tecting only user uncertainty when modeling perfor-
mance. These results provide strong evidence that
enhancing a spoken dialogue system to detect and
adapt to multiple affective states (specifically, user
disengagement and uncertainty) has the potential to
significantly improve performance even in the pres-
ence of noise due to automatic detection, when com-
pared with only adapting to one affective state or ig-
noring affect entirely.
2 Related Work
Our focus in this paper is on first using machine
learning to develop a detector of user disengagement
for spoken dialogue systems, and then evaluating its
usefulness as fully as possible prior to its implemen-
tation and deployment with real users.
Disengaged users are highly undesirable in
human-computer interaction because they increase
the potential for user dissatisfaction and task fail-
ure; thus over the past decade there has already been
substantial prior work focused on detecting user dis-
engagement and the closely related states of bore-
dom, motivation and lack of interest (e.g., (Schuller
et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Jeon et
al., 2010; Schuller et al., 2009a; Bohus and Horvitz,
2009; Martalo et al., 2008; Porayska-Pomsta et al.,
2008; Kapoor and Picard, 2005; Sidner and Lee,
2003; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b)).
Within this work, specific affect definitions vary
slightly with the intention of being coherent within
the application and domain and being relevant to the
specific adaptation goal (Martalo et al., 2008). How-
ever, affective systems researchers generally agree
that disengaged users show little involvement in the
interaction, and often display facial, gestural and lin-
guistic signals such as gaze avoidance, finger tap-
ping, humming, sarcasm, et cetera.
The features used to detect disengagement also
vary depending on system domain and applica-
tion. For example, Sidner & Lee (2003) are in-
terested in modeling more natural and collabora-
tive human-robot interactions during basic conver-
sations. They define an algorithm for the engage-
ment process that involves appropriate eye gaze and
turn-taking. Martalo et al. (2008) study how user
engagement influences dialogue patterns during in-
teractions with an embodied agent that gives ad-
vice about healthy dieting. They model engage-
ment using manually coded dialogue acts based on
the SWBDL-DAMSL scheme (Stolcke et al., 2000).
Bohus and Horvitz (2009) study systems that attract
and engage users for dynamic, multi-party dialogues
in open-world settings. They model user intentions
to engage the system with cues from facial sensors
and the dialogue. Within recent spoken dialogue
research, acoustic-prosodic, lexical and contextual
features have been found to be effective detectors
of disengagement (Schuller et al., 2010; Wang and
Hirschberg, 2011; Jeon et al., 2010); we will briefly
compare our own results with these in Section 5.
While all of the above-mentioned research has
presented intrinsic evaluations of their disengage-
ment modeling efforts that indicate a reasonable de-
gree of accuracy as compared to a gold standard
(e.g., manual coding), only a few have yet demon-
strated that the model?s detected values are useful
92
in practice and/or are a reasonable substitute for
the gold standard with respect to some practical
objective (e.g., a relationship to performance). In
particular, two studies (Bohus and Horvitz, 2009;
Schuller et al., 2009a) have gone directly from in-
trinsic evaluation of (dis)engagement models to per-
forming user studies with the implemented model,
thereby bypassing other less expensive and less
labor-intensive means of extrinsic evaluation to
quantify their model?s usefulness?and potentially in-
dicate its need to be further improved?before de-
ployment with real users. Neither study reports sta-
tistically significant improvements in system perfor-
mance as a result of detecting user (dis)engagement.
Finally, while substantial spoken dialogue and af-
fective systems research has shown that users dis-
play a range of affective states while interacting with
a system (e.g. (Schuller et al., 2009b; Conati and
Maclaren, 2009; Batliner et al., 2008; Devillers and
Vidrascu, 2006; Lee and Narayanan, 2005; Shafran
et al., 2003; Ang et al., 2002)), to date only a few af-
fective systems have been built that detect and adapt
to multiple user affective states (e.g., (D?Mello et al.,
2010; Aist et al., 2002; Tsukahara andWard, 2001)),
and most of these have been deployed with cru-
cial natural language processing components ?wiz-
arded? by a hidden human agent (e.g., who performs
speech recognition or affect annotation on the user
turns); moreover, none have yet shown significant
improvements in system performance as a result of
adapting to multiple user affective states.
3 ITSPOKE: Spoken Dialogue Tutor
We develop and evaluate our disengagement detec-
tor using a corpus of spoken dialogues from a 2008
controlled experiment evaluating our uncertainty-
adaptive spoken dialogue tutoring system, IT-
SPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialog sys-
tem) (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).2
ITSPOKE tutors 5 Newtonian physics problems
(one per dialogue), using a Tutor Question - Stu-
dent Answer - Tutor Response format. After
each tutor question, the student speech is digi-
tized from head-mounted microphone input and sent

tor (VanLehn et al., 2002).
to the Sphinx2 recognizer, which yields an auto-
matic transcript (Huang et al., 1993). This an-
swer?s (in)correctness is then automatically classi-
fied based on this transcript, using the TuTalk se-
mantic analyzer (Jordan et al., 2007), and the an-
swer?s (un)certainty is automatically classified by
inputting features of the speech signal, the automatic
transcript, and the dialogue context into a logistic
regression model. We will discuss these features
further in Section 5. All natural language process-
ing components were trained using prior ITSPOKE
corpora. The appropriate tutor response is deter-
mined based on the answer?s automatically labeled
(in)correctness and (un)certainty and then sent to the
Cepstral text-to-speech system3, whose audio output
is played through the student headphones and is also
displayed on a web-based interface.
The experimental procedure was as follows: col-
lege students with no college-level physics (1) read
a short physics text, (2) took a pretest, (3) worked
5 ?training? problems with ITSPOKE, where each
user received a varying level of uncertainty adapta-
tion based on condition, (4) took a user satisfaction
survey, (5) took a posttest isomorphic to the pretest,
and (6) worked a ?test? problem with ITSPOKE that
was isomorphic to the 5th training problem, where
no user received any uncertainty adaptation.
The resulting corpus contains 432 dialogues (6
per student) and 7216 turns from 72 students, 47
female and 25 male. All turns are used in the dis-
engagement detection experiments described next.
However, only the training problem dialogues (360,
5 per student, 6044 student turns) are used for the
performance analyses in Sections 6-7, because the
final test problem was given after the instruments
measuring performance (survey and posttest).
Our survey and tests are the same as those used in
multiple prior ITSPOKE experiments (c.f., (Forbes-
Riley and Litman, 2011a)). The pretest and posttest
each contain 26 multiple choice questions querying
knowledge of the topics covered in the dialogues.
Average pretest and posttest scores in the corpus
were 51.0% and 73.1% (out of 100%) with stan-
dard deviations of 14.5% and 13.8%, respectively.
The user satisfaction survey contains 16 statements

93
vey score was 60.9 (out of 80), with a standard de-
viation of 8.5. While the statements themselves are
listed elsewhere (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009),
9 statements concern the tutoring domain (e.g., The
tutor was effective/precise/useful), 7 of which were
taken from (Baylor et al., 2003) and 2 of which
were created for our system. 3 statements concern
user uncertainty levels and were created for our sys-
tem. 4 statements concern the spoken dialogue in-
teraction (e.g., It was easy to understand the tutor?s
speech) and were taken from (Walker et al., 2002).
Our survey has also been incorporated into other re-
cent work exploring user satisfaction in spoken dia-
logue computer tutors (Dzikovska et al., 2011). In
Section 6 we discuss how user scores on these in-
struments are used to measure system performance.
See (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a) for further
details of ITSPOKE and the 2008 experiment.
Following the experiment, the entire corpus
was manually labeled for (in)correctness (cor-
rect, incorrect), (un)certainty (CER, UNC) and
(dis)engagement (ENG, DISE) by one trained an-
notator. Table 1 shows the distribution of the la-
beled turns in the 2008 ITSPOKE corpus. In prior
ITSPOKE corpora, our annotator displayed interan-
notator agreement of 0.85 and 0.62 Kappa on cor-
rectness and uncertainty, respectively (Forbes-Riley
and Litman, 2011a). For the disengagement label,
a reliability analysis was performed over several an-
notation rounds on subsets of the 2008 ITSPOKE
corpus by this and a second trained annotator, yield-
ing 0.55 Kappa (this analysis is described in detail
elsewhere (Forbes-Riley et al., 2011)). Our Kap-
pas indicate that user uncertainty and disengage-
ment can both be annotated with moderate reliabil-
ity in our dataset, on par with prior emotion anno-
tation work (c.f., (Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2011)).
Note however that the best way to label users? in-
ternal affective state(s) is still an open question.
Many system researchers (including ourselves) rely
on trained labelers (e.g., (Pon-Barry et al., 2006;
Porayska-Pomsta et al., 2008)) while others use self-
reports (e.g., (Conati and Maclaren, 2009; Gratch et
al., 2009; McQuiggan et al., 2008)). Both meth-
ods are problematic; for example both can be ren-
dered inaccurate when users mask their true feel-
ings. Two studies that have compared self-reports,
peer labelers, trained labelers, and combinations of
labelers (Afzal and Robinson, 2011; D?Mello et al.,
2008) both illustrate the common finding that hu-
man annotators display low to moderate interannota-
tor reliability for affect annotation, and both studies
show that trained labelers yield the highest reliabil-
ity on this task. Despite the lack of high interan-
notator reliability, responding to affect detected by
trained human labels has still been shown to improve
system performance (see Section 1).

4 Automatically Detecting User
Disengagement (DISE) in ITSPOKE
As noted in Section 1, we have developed a user dis-
engagement detector to incorporate into our existing
uncertainty-adaptive spoken dialogue system. The
result will be a state of the art system that adapts to
multiple affective states during the dialogue.
4.1 Binary DISE Label
Our disengagement annotation scheme (Forbes-
Riley et al., 2011) was derived from empirical ob-
servations in our data but draws on prior work,
including work mentioned in Section 2, appraisal
theory-based emotion models (e.g., Conati and Ma-
claren (2009))4, and prior approaches to annotating
disengagement or related states in tutoring (Lehman
et al., 2008; Porayska-Pomsta et al., 2008).
Briefly, our overall Disengagement label (DISE)
is used for turns expressing moderate to strong dis-
engagement towards the interaction, i.e., responses
given without much effort or without caring about
appropriateness. Responses might also be accompa-
nied by signs of inattention, boredom, or irritation.
Clear examples include answers spoken quickly in
leaden monotone, with sarcastic or playful tones,
or with off-task sounds such as rhythmic tapping or

electronics usage.5 Note that our DISE label is de-
fined independently of the tutoring domain and thus
should generalize across spoken dialogue systems.
Figure 1 illustrates the DISE, (in)correctness, and
(un)certainty labels across 3 tutor/student turn pairs.
U1 is labeled DISE and UNC because the student
gave up immediately and with irritation when too
much prior knowledge was required. U2 is labeled
DISE and UNC because the student avoided giv-
ing a specific numerical value, offering instead a
vague (and obviously incorrect) answer. U3 is la-
beled DISE and CER because the student sang the
correct answer, indicating a lack of interest in the
larger purpose of the material being discussed.6

tion? Please specify the units too.

releases them?
U3: graaa-vi-tyyyyy <sings the answer> (DISE, cor-
rect, CER)

4.2 DISE Detection Method
Machine learning classification was done at the turn
level using WEKA software7 and 10-fold cross val-
idation. A J48 decision tree was chosen because of
its easily read output and the fact that previous ex-
periments with our data showed little variance be-
5Affective systems research has found total disengagement
rare in laboratory settings (Lehman et al., 2008; Martalo et al.,
2008). As in that research, we equate the DISE label with no
or low engagement. Since total disengagement is common in
real-world unobserved human-computer interactions (deleting
unsatisfactory software being an extreme example) it remains
an open question as to how well laboratory findings generalize.
6Our original scheme distinguished six DISE subtypes
that trained annotators distinguished with a reliability of .43
Kappa (Forbes-Riley et al., 2011). However, pilot experiments
indicated that our models cannot accurately distinguish them,
thus our DISE detector focuses on the DISE label.

tween different machine learning algorithms (Drum-
mond and Litman, 2011). We also use a cost matrix,
which heavily penalizes classifying a true DISE in-
stance as false, because our class distributions are
highly skewed (16.21% DISE turns) and the cost
matrix successfully mitigated the skew?s effect in
our prior work, where the uncertainty distribution is
also skewed (20.55% UNC turns) (Drummond and
Litman, 2011).
To train our DISE model, we first extracted the set
of speech and dialogue features shown in Figure 2
from the user turns in our corpus. As shown, the
acoustic-prosodic features represent duration, paus-
ing, pitch, and energy, and were normalized by the
first user turn, as well as totaled and averaged over
each dialogue. The lexical and dialogue features
consist of the current dialogue name (i.e., one of the
six physics problems) and turn number, the current
ITSPOKE question?s name (e.g.,T3 in Figure 1 has
a unique identifier) and depth in the discourse struc-
ture (e.g., an ITSPOKE remediation question after
an incorrect user answer would be at one greater
depth than the prior question), a word occurrence
vector for the automatically recognized text of the
user turn, an automatic (in)correctness label, and
lastly, the number of user turns since the last cor-
rect turn (?incorrect runs?). We also included two
user-based features, gender and pretest score.

Note that although our feature set was drawn pri-
marily from our prior uncertainty detection exper-
iments (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a; Drum-
mond and Litman, 2011), we have also experi-
mented with other features, including state-of-the-
art acoustic-prosodic features used in the last Inter-
speech Challenges (Schuller et al., 2010; Schuller et
al., 2009b) and made freely available in the openS-
MILE Toolkit (Florian et al., 2010). To date, how-
ever, these features have only decreased the cross-
validation performance of our models.8 While some
of our features are tutoring-specific, these have sim-
ilar counterparts in other applications (i.e., answer
(in)correctness corresponds to a more general no-
tion of ?response appropriateness? in other domains,
while pretest score corresponds to the general no-
tion of domain expertise). Moreover, all of our fea-
tures are fully automatic and available in real-time,
so that the model can be directly implemented and
deployed. To that end, we now describe the results
of our intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of our DISE
model, aimed at determining whether it is ready to
be evaluated with real users.
5 Intrinsic Evaluation: Cross-Validation
Table 2 shows the averaged results of the cross-
validation with the J48 decision tree algorithm. In
addition to accuracy, we use Unweighted Aver-
age (UA) Precision9, Recall, and F-measure be-
cause they are the standard measures used to eval-
uate current affect recognition technology, particu-
larly for unbalanced two-class problems (Schuller
et al., 2009b). In addition, we use the cross corre-
lation (CC) measure and mean linear error (MLE)
because these metrics were used in recent work for
evaluating disengagement (level of interest) detec-
tors for the Interspeech 2010 challenge (Schuller et
8We also tried using our automatic UNC label as a feature in
our DISE model, but our results weren?t significantly improved.
9simply ((Precision(DISE) + Precision(ENG))/2)
al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Jeon et al.,
2010)).10 Note however that the Interspeech 2010
task differs from ours not only in the corpus and fea-
tures, but also in the learning task: they used regres-
sion to detect a continuous level of interest ranging
from 0 to 1, while we detect a binary class. Thus
comparison between our results and those are only
suggestive rather than conclusive.
As shown in Table 2, we also compare our results
with those of majority class (ENG) labeling of the
same turns. Since (7216-1170)/7216 user turns in
the corpus are engaged (recall Table 1), always se-
lecting the majority class (ENG) label for these turns
thus yields 83.8% accuracy (with 0% precision and
recall for DISE, and 83.8% precision and 100% re-
call for ENG). While our DISE model does not out-
perform majority class labeling with respect to ac-
curacy, this is not surprising given the steep skew
in class distribution, and our learned model signif-
icantly outperforms the baseline with respect to all
the other measures (p<.001).11
Our CC and MLE results are on par with the best
results from the state-of-the-art systems competing
in the 2010 Interspeech Challenge, where the task
was to detect level of interest. In particular, the win-
ner obtained a CC of 0.428 (higher numbers are bet-
ter) and an MLE of 0.146 (lower numbers are bet-
ter) (Jeon et al., 2010), while a subsequent study
yielded a CC of 0.480 and an MLE of 0.131 on
the same corpus (Wang and Hirschberg, 2011). Our
results are also on par with the best results of the
other prior research on detecting disengagement dis-
cussed in Section 2 that detects a small number of
disengagement classes and reports accuracy and/or
recall and precision. For example, (Martalo et al.,
2008) report average precision of 75% and recall

sion settings. MLE is a regression performance measure for the

of 74% (detecting three levels of disengagement),
while (Kapoor and Picard, 2005) report an accuracy
of 86% for detecting binary (dis)interest.
Our final DISE model was produced by running
the J48 algorithm over our entire corpus. The re-
sulting decision tree contains 141 nodes and 75
leaves. Inspection of the tree reveals that all of the
feature types in Figure 2 (acoustic-prosodic, lexi-
cal/dialogue, user identifier) are used as decision
nodes in the tree, although not all variations on these
types were used. The upper-level nodes of the tree
are usually considered to be more informative fea-
tures as compared to lower-level nodes, since they
are queried for more leaves. The upper level of
the DISE model consists entirely of temporal, lex-
ical, pitch and energy features as well as question
name and depth and incorrect runs, while features
such as gender, turn number, and dialogue name
appear only near the leaves, and pretest score and
turn (in)correctness don?t appear at all. The amount
of pausing prior to the start of the user turn is the
most important feature for determining disengage-
ment, with pauses shorter than a quarter second be-
ing labeled DISE, suggesting that fast answers are a
strong signal of disengagement in our system. Users
who answer quickly may do so without taking the
time to think it through; the more engaged user, in
contrast, takes more time to prepare an answer.
Three lexical items from the student turns, ?fric-
tion?, ?light?, and ?greater?, are the next most im-
portant features in the tree, suggesting that particular
concepts and question types can be typically associ-
ated with user disengagement in a system. For ex-
ample, open-ended system questions may lead users
to disengage due to frustration from not knowing
when their answer is complete. One common case
in ITSPOKE involves asking users to name all the
forces on an object; some users don?t know how
many to list, so they start listing random forces, such
as ?friction.? On the other hand, multiple choice
questions can also lead users to disengage; they be-
gin with a reasonable chance of being correct and
thus don?t take the time to think through their an-
swer. One common case in ITSPOKE involves ask-
ing users to determine which of two objects has the
greater or lesser force, acceleration, and velocity.
While our feature set is highly generalizable to
other domains, it is an empirical question as to
whether the feature values we found maximally ef-
fective for predicting disengagement also general-
ize to other domains. Intuition is often unreliable,
and it has been widely shown in affect prediction
that the answer can depend on domain, dataset, and
learning algorithm employed. Moreover, there are
many types of spoken dialogue systems with dif-
ferent styles and no single type can represent the
entire field. That said, it is also important to note
that there are lessons to be learned from the features
selected for one particular domain, in terms of the
take-home message for other domains. For example,
the fact that ?prior pause? is selected as a strong sig-
nal of disengagement in ITSPOKE dialogues may
indicate that the feature itself (regardless of its se-
lected value) could be transferred to different do-
mains, alone or in the demonstrated combinations
with the other selected features.
6 Extrinsic Evaluation: Correlation
Next we use extrinsic evaluation to confirm that our
final DISE model is both useful and a reasonable
substitute for our gold standard manual DISE la-
bels. With respect to showing the utility of detecting
DISE, we use a correlational analysis to show that
the gold standard (manual) DISE values are signif-
icantly predictive of two different measures of sys-
tem performance.12 With respect to showing the ad-
equacy of our current level of detection performance
for the learned DISE model, we demonstrate that af-
ter replacing the manual DISE labels with the au-
tomatic DISE labels when running our correlations,
the automatic labels are related to performance in
the same way as the gold standard labels.
Thus for both our automatically detected DISE la-
bels (auto) and our gold standard DISE labels (man-
ual), we first computed the total number of occur-
rences for each student, and then computed a bivari-
ate Pearson?s correlation between this total and two
different metrics of performance: learning gain (LG)
and user satisfaction (US). In the tutoring domain,
learning is the primary performance metric and as is
common in this domain we compute it as normal-
ized learning gain ((posttest score-pretest score)/(1-
12Spoken dialogue research has shown that redesigning a sys-
tem in light of such correlational analysis can indeed yield per-
formance improvements (Rotaru and Litman, 2009).

isfaction is the primary performance metric and as
is common in this domain we compute it by totaling
over the user satisfaction survey scores.13
Table 3 shows first the mean and standard devia-
tion for the DISE label over all students, the Pear-
son?s Correlation coefficient (R) and its significance
(p). As shown, both our manual and automatic DISE
labels are significantly related to performance, re-
gardless of whether we measure it as user satisfac-
tion or learning gain.14 Moreover, in both cases the
correlations are nearly identical between the man-
ual and automatic labels. These results indicate that
the detected DISE values are a useful substitute for
the gold standard, and suggest that redesigning IT-
SPOKE to recognize and respond to DISE can sig-
nificantly improve system performance.
7 Extrinsic Evaluation: Affective State
Multiple Regression
Because we are adding our disengagement detector
to a spoken dialogue system that already detects and
adapts to user uncertainty, we argue that it is also
necessary to evaluate whether greater performance
benefits are likely to be obtained by adapting to a
second state. In other words, given how difficult it is
to effectively detect and adapt to one user affective
state, is performance likely to improve by detecting
and adapting to multiple affective states?
To answer this question, we performed a multi-
ple linear regression analysis aimed at quantifying
the relative usefulness of the automatically detected
13Identical results were obtained by using an average instead
of a total, and only slightly weaker results were obtained when
normalizing the DISE totals as the percentages of total turns.
14We previously found a related correlation between different
DISE and learning measures, during the analysis of our DISE
annotation scheme (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b). In par-
ticular, we showed a significant partial correlation between the
percentage of manual DISE labels and posttest controlled for
pretest score.
disengagement and uncertainty labels when predict-
ing our system performance metrics. We ran four
stepwise linear regressions. The first regression pre-
dicted learning gain, and gave the model two possi-
ble inputs: the total number of automatic DISE la-
bels and UNC labels per user. We then ran the same
regression again, this time predicting user satisfac-
tion. For comparison, we ran the same two regres-
sions using the manual DISE and UNC labels.
As the trained regression models in Figure 3 show,
when predicting learning gain, selecting both auto-
matically detected affective state metrics as inputs
significantly increases the model?s predictive power
as compared to only selecting one.15 The (stan-
dardized) feature weights indicate relative predic-
tive power in accounting for the variance in learn-
ing gain. As shown, both automatic affect metrics
have the same weight in the final model. This re-
sult suggests that adapting to our automatically de-
tected disengagement and uncertainty labels can fur-
ther improve learning over and above adapting to un-
certainty alone. Although the final model?s predic-
tive power is low (R2=0.15), our interest here is only
in investigating whether the two affective states are
more useful in combination than in isolation for pre-
dicting performance. In similar types of stepwise re-
gressions on prior ITSPOKE corpora, we?ve shown
that more complete models of system performance
incorporating many predictors of learning (i.e. af-
fective states in conjunction with other dialogue fea-
tures) can yield R2 values of over .5 (Forbes-Riley
et al., 2008).16
15Using the stepwise method, Automatic DISE was the first
feature selected, and Automatic UNC the second. However,
note that a model consisting of only the Automatic UNC metric
also yields significantly worse predictive power than selecting
both affective state metrics. Further note that almost identical
models were produced using percentages rather than totals.
16R2 is the standard reported metric for linear regressions.
However, for consistency with Table 3, note that the two models
in Figure 3 yield R values of -.31 and -.38, respectively.

Learning Gain = -.31 * Total Automatic DISE (R2=.09, p=.009)
Learning Gain = -.24 * Total Automatic DISE - .24 * Total Automatic UNC (R2=.15, p=.004)
Figure 3: Performance Model?s Predictive Power Increases Significantly with Multiple Affective Features
Interestingly, for the regression models of learn-
ing gain that used manual affect metrics, only the
DISE metric was selected as an input. This indi-
cates that the automatic affective state labels are use-
ful in combination for predicting performance in a
way that is not reflected in their gold standard coun-
terparts. Detecting multiple affective states might
thus be one way to compensate for the noise that is
introduced in a fully-automated affective spoken di-
alogue system.
Similarly, only the DISE metric was selected
for inclusion in the regression model of user sat-
isfaction, regardless of whether manual or auto-
matic labels were used. A separate correlation
analysis showed that user uncertainty is not sig-
nificantly correlated with user satisfaction in our
system, though we previously found that multiple
uncertainty-related metrics do significantly correlate
with learning (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2009).
8 Summary and Current Directions
In this paper we used extrinsic evaluations to pro-
vide evidence for the utility of a new system de-
sign involving the complex task of user affect de-
tection, prior to undertaking an expensive and time-
consuming evaluation of an affect-adaptive system
with real users. In particular, we first presented a
novel model for automatically detecting user disen-
gagement in spoken dialogue systems. We showed
through intrinsic evaluations (i.e., cross-validation
experiments using gold-standard labels) that the
model yields results on par with prior work. We
then showed crucially through novel extrinsic eval-
uation that the resulting automatically detected dis-
engagement labels correlate with two primary per-
formance metrics (user satisfaction and learning) in
the same way as gold standard (manual) labels. This
suggests that adapting to the automatic disengage-
ment labels has the potential to significantly improve
performance even in the presence of noise from the
automatic labeling. Finally, further extrinsic anal-
yses using multiple regression suggest that adapt-
ing to our automatic disengagement labels can im-
prove learning (though not user satisfaction) over
and above the improvement achieved by only adapt-
ing to automatically detected user uncertainty.
We have already developed and implemented an
adaptation for user disengagement in ITSPOKE.
The disengagement adaptation draws on empiri-
cal analyses of our data and effective responses
to user disengagement presented in prior work
(c.f., (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b)), We are
currently evaluating our disengagement adaptation
in the ?ideal? environment of a Wizard of Oz exper-
iment, where user disengagement, uncertainty, and
correctness are labeled by a hidden human during
user interactions with ITSPOKE.
Based on the evaluations here, we believe our dis-
engagement model is ready for implementation in
ITSPOKE. We will then evaluate the resulting spo-
ken dialogue system for detecting and adapting to
multiple affective states in an upcoming controlled
experiment with real users.
