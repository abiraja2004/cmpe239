PUSHDOWN STORES AND SUBSCRIPTS  
Abst rac t  
Va~r ious  dev ices  fo r  the  imp rovement  o f  phrase  
s t ructure  grammars  (PSG) have  been suggested  
recent ly .  In  par t i cu la r ,  the  PSG mode l  w i th  
a pushdown s tore  (PSG/PDS)  a s descr ibed  by  
VoYngve ,  and the  PSG wi th  subscr ip ts  (PSG/S)  
as  descr ibed  by  G oHarman are  cons idered .  
It is contended that such  dev ices ,  even  if 
they  may do away w i th  some of the d i f f i cu l _  
t ies  of  PSG, do not conta in  su f f i c ient  gene_  
ra t ive  power  to produce  the s t ruc tura l ly  corn_ 
p l i ca ted  sentences  that are generated  by  o ther  
g ramma rs (e.g., of t rans format iona l  type) .  
The  hand l ing  of mu l t ip le  d isco ,Lt inuous  con_  
s t i tuents  (DC) in PSG/PDS,  as we l l  as the use 
of  : le let ion ru les  in PSC./S is examined  and 
c r i t i c i zed .  It is shown that  the improvements  
on PSG wi l l  not a l low the grammar  to generate  
a ii the sentences  of the language that a t rans_  
fo rmat iona l  g rammar  (TG) does ;  moreovdr ,  the 
improvements  on PSG a re obta ined  on ly  at the 
cost  of  in t roduc ing  too much power  at the PS 
leve l ,  so that the improved  gr;~mmars in some 
cases  w i l l  exceed  the requ i rem@nts  of the de_  
sc r ip t ion ,  i .e. generate  non_grammat ica l  sent_  
ences .

O. In t roduct ion  
NoChomsky  has argued that a PSG is not suff_  
ic ient  to generate  all the grammat ica l  sent_ 
ences of a language (Chomsky 1957:3~ ff.). 
Recent ly ,  this conceot ion  of PSG has been 
c r i t i c i zed  as be ing  too pr imi t ive  (Yngve 
1960:445a,  Harman 1963:604 fro), and several  
ways of improv ing  such a grammar  have been 
suggested:  a PDS has been connected  wi th  a 
PSG (Yngve 1960, 1961, 1962); the use of 
subscr ip t  notat ion  has been recommended to 
give PSG a fa i r  chance in compet i t ion  with 
TG (Harman 1963).  
i. PSG/PDS 
l.lo PSG and DC 
The prob lem of the so_ca l led  d i scont inuous  
sonst i tuents  (for a deta i led  t reatment ,  see 
Wel ls  1947:96 ff.) has always been a crux in 
IC analys is .  One of the drawbacks  of PSG as 
descr ibed  by Chomsky,  is that it is not able 
to handle  these const i tuents  in a way that 
sat i s f ies  both  the formal c r i te r ia  of the 
grammar  and the in tu i t ive  fee l ing  that ca l l  
and up in, e.g., I ca l led h im u~, be long  to_ 
gether  and shou ld  be t reated accord ing ly  in 
the analys is .  Chomsky,  in his d i scuss ion  of 
PSG l imi ta t ions ,  admits the poss ib i l i ty  of 
"extend ing  the not ions  of phrase s t ructure  
to account  for d i scont inu i t ies"  (Chomsky 
Mey 4 
1957:41) ,  but, he adds, "...fairly ser ious 
d i f f i cu l t ies  ar ise in any sys temat ic  attempt 
to pursue this course."  
An attempt in this d i rec t ion  is descr ibed  by 
V .Yngve in severa l  art ic les  (see espec ia l l y  
Yngve 1960); a l though the presence of DC 
is the most annoy ing  of the compl i ca t ions  
under  the PSG model  (Yngve 1960:448a) ,  the 
so lut ion  ~f fered  to this par t i cu la r  prob lem 
impl ies  a w ider  claim, namely,  that "any 
shor tcomings  /o f  PSG, JM/ can be overcome" 
( Ib . :445a) .  Accord ing ly ,  I wi l l  d i scuss  be_ 
low not only  the problem of DC, but also the 
more genera l  one of s t ructure in a PSG/PDS.  
1o2o DC and PDS 
The cruc ia l  step in the der ivat ion  of DC by 
the automaton  (for a full descr ip t ion ,  see 
Yngve 1960:448_9)  is the quest ion  asked: 
Does the r ight  ha l f  of the grammar  rule in 
quest ion  (GRi) conta in  the symbol  "..." ? 
(where ".. o" stands for "d i scont inu i ty  in 
rewr i t ing  the symbol  on the left  hand side 
of the rule")  I f  the answer is Yes, we have 
to roll  out the temporary  memory  (TM) ta~e 
one space (in a f low chart, one woul~ sym_ 
bo l i ze  this by the index notat ion  1 - - I  --> i, 
where 1 stands for " leftmost":  " ro l l ing  in" 
tape would then be ind icated by 1 + ? --> i, 
see Fig. ~). Dur ing  this operation, the 
or ig ina l  content  of TM 1 (the le f tmost  loca_ 
Mey 5 
t ion of TM) has to be kept in place, that is, 
the b lank  has to occur  af ter  the or ig ina l  TM 1 
(on the r ight  side, if the tape is thought of 
as mov ing  f rom the left, see Fig? ~). If, how_ 
ever, the answer  is No, we have to make sure 
that we have space for all the symbols  on the 
r ight  hand side of the rule and rol l  out tape 
accord ing ly .  Let ~ be the number  of symbols  
on the r ight hand side of GRi: then we can 
symbo l i ze  the ro l l ing  out by the index formula  
i -- (n -- ~ the f irst  symbol a lways goes 
to the comput ing  reg ister .  
Let fu r ther  ~ be the subscr ipt  for r ight  hand 
side symbols  of GR i. The rest of the operat ion  
is then per formed as rout ine count ing  on GRi.  , 
3 i be ing  set at 2 (the first symbol  has a l ready 
been taken care of). There should, of course,  
be a prov iso for the symbol "..." i tself ,  so 
that it wi l l  not be cop ied onto the TM taoe. 
The method as descr ibed  here wil l  work  neat ly  
even in those cases where DC are "nested~ that 
is, if the expans ion  of some DC turns out to 
be another  DC (and so on, at least theoret i ca l _  
ly). As an example,  one may try out the doub ly  
d i scont inuous  as far as the corner,  where all 
the necessary  rules are sDec l f ied  by Yngve 
h imse l f  (1960:449a) .  
An impl ic i t  assumpt ion  throughout  the descr ip_  
t ion  of the mechan ism is that  DC can be repres_  
ented by the s imple  fo rmula  A --> B + 9 ,o  + C .  
It fo l lows that there are two cases that  cannot  
Mey 6 
be hand led  d i rec t ly  by  the mach ine :  the f i r s t  
one can  be symbo l i zed  by A --> B + ... + C + 
... + D ( "mul~p le  d i scont inuous  const i tuents" ) ;  
th is  reduces  eas i ly  to doub le  d i scont inu i ty  by 
a su i tab le  man ipu la t ion  of the inout  ru les .  
The  o ther  case  cou ld  be labe led  "d i scont inu_  
ous mul t ip le  const i tuents" :  fo rmula  A --> B + 
C + ..o + D (or some var ia t ion  on th is  theme) ,  
wh ich  wou ld  imp ly  that  the b lank  has to occur  
two spaces  f rom le f tmost  ins~ad of one. Fo l l _  
ow ing  the ins t ruc t ions  g iven  by  Yngve  we wou ld  
not obta in  the r ight  s t r ing  of symbo ls  in this  
case (as examples ,  one may try: He 's  not that 
b in  a fool ,  or: As n ice  a l i t t le  par lo r  as ever  
you d id  see, or the Soan ish  sentence :  Hab la  mas 
de lo que sabe 'He ta lks  more  than  what  he knows '  
(Bo l inger  1957:63) ,  where  common sense wou ld  
pre fer  the ana lyses  that b i~ ... foo l ,  as n ice  
( ? .. ~ar lo r ,  mas de ... que see d iagrams in 
Fig.  2), thus pre3erv ing  ana logy  w i th  const ruc_  
t ions  l ike such  a foo l  etc. The  program cou ld  
be accommodmted to per fo rm this  by combin ing  
a count ing  operat ion  w i th  the check  on " " o .o  , 
whereaf ter  the cont inuous  part  of GR i ' s  r ight  
hand  s ide cou ld  be thrown in w i th  the non_DC 
ru les .  Der ivat ion  be ing  d i f fe rent ,  there  wou ld  
be no in ter fe rence  f rom const ruct ions  l ike 
that b ig  fool ,  that  are t reated  in the normal  
way  by the mach ine .  
A dev ice  l ike the one descr ibed  here  wi l l ,  
w i th in  its obv ious  l im i ta t ions ,  be able to 
randomly  generate  sentences  that  are for the 
most  part qu i te  grammatical (Yngve  1962:70) .  
Mey 7 
The quest ion  is: wi l l  it generate  all, and 
only, the grammat ica l  sentences  of a fang_ 
uage? I wi l l  try to answer  this quest ion  in 
the next paragraph.  
1.3. L imi ta t ions  of PSG/PD ~ 
A l though the model  as proposed  by Yngve in its 
or ig ina l  form only  uses the PDS techn ique  to 
solve a minor  prob lem in syntact i c  ana lys is  
by  the machine,  the scope and use of  PDS are 
by no means l im i ted  to this par t i cu la r  pro_ 
b lem of DC (For a deta i led  d i scuss ion ,  see 
Oet t inger  1961:126_7). The e legancy  and s im_ 
p l ic i ty  of PDS a lgor i thms make them wel l_  
su i ted for p rocedures  of automat ic  syntact i c  
analys is  of languages.  
There  are, however,  some inherent  l imi tat ions .  
Common to all  PDS techn iques  is the fact that 
in fo rmat ion  s tored  in this way on ly  is access_  
ible in accordance  wi th  the fo rmula  "last in, 
f i rst  out". Be ing essent ia l l y  a l inear  array 
of in fo rmat ion  (Oet t inger  1961: i04) ,  the user  
(the machine)  wi l l  not be able to draw on other  
in fo rmat ion  than  is g iven  by the le f tmost  sym_ 
bol in a le f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct ion  (the temDo_  
rary  memory  tape in Yngve 's  machine,  see F ig . l ) .  
Since, on the one hand, the mach ine  output is 
past contro l  (what is Dr inted,  is no longer  
ava i lab le  to the mach ine  for inspect ion)  and, 
on the other  hand, the in terna l  state of the 
machine is ent i re ly  determined by  the current  
input symbol,  one has to keep carefu l  account  
Mey 8 
not on ly  of the current  der ivat lona l  steps, 
but also of the " le f t _overs"  f rom ear l ie r  
steps. Th is  is exact ly  what  a PDS can do, 
and the ~roblems in connect ion  w i th  this 
techn ique  are, as shown above in the case 
of the so_ca l led  d i scont inuous  mul t ip le  
const i tuents ,  are main ly  techn ica l  (provid_ 
ing indexes etc.)  
The l inear  character  of the memory,  however,  
together  wi th  the f in i te state oropert ies  of 
the model  i t se l f  give r ise to a~other  prob lem 
that seems unso lvab le  under  the fo l lowing ass_ 
umpt ions  for our machine:  a f in i te  number  of 
states,  a l inear  temporary  memory,  and a 
t rans i t ion  from one state into anether  by one_ 
symbol  inout. The prob lem is the fo l lowing:  
g iven  any internal  state of th~ach ine  that  is 
determined  by more than one symbol  s imu l tane_  
ousiy,  wi l l  the supp lementary  dev ice  of a PDS 
be able to suDply the necessary  ins t ruct ions  
to the mach ine  that are not conta ined  in the 
cur rent  symbol? 
The answer  is in the negat ive ,  p rec i se ly  be_ 
cause the memory  is l inear,  and there is no 
" look_up"  for items in the memory? What is stor_ 
ed in the memory can only be brought  up to the 
sur face  by someth ing  outs ide  the memory  itself ,  
that is, I have to c reate  an "expectancy"  that 
is spec i f i c  for each i tem in the PDS. Only  
under  these cond i t ions  the state of the mach ine  
can be de f ined  as determined  by the current  
symbol  plus the oontents  of the temporary  mem_ 
ory (Yngve 1960:~49).  This  is essent ia l l y  the 
Mey 9 
procedure  descr ibed  by Har r i s  for keep ing  
t rack  of nested const ruct ions  ( " incur rence  
and d ischarge  of requ i rements" ,  Har r i s  1962: 
53). The reason why the mach ine  is able to 
hand le  DC is that this "nest ing"  occurs in 
one level,  so that the symbols  invo lved  can 
be un ique ly  determined as be long ing  to the 
same d imens ion  of analys is .  
Where  "sur face  s t ructure"  is exp la ined  only 
by under ly ing  "deed st ructure"  (Hockett  1959: 
246 ff .) ,  the mach ine  wi l l  not be able to carry  
out the analys is  correct ly .  The s t ructure  that 
under l ies  a symbol  X 1 may be bound up wi th  a 
spec ia l  PS der ivat ion ,  so that ru les  concern_  
ing s t ructures  like, say, X 1 + X 2 + X~ wi l l  
be ambiguous  in the i r  a~pl icat ion .  One could 
p lace res t r i c t ions  (in Harr is '  sense) on (one 
of) the symbols,  thus c reat ing  a mul t ip le  path 
through the der ivat ion ,  poss ib ly  combined with 
a cyc l ing  device: this is what the subscr iot  
techn ique  does, see 2.4 for a deta i led  d iscuss_  
ion. Some of the d i f f i cu l t ies  are removed in 
this way, but others pers ist ,  l ike those cases 
where  pairs  of symbol  formulae  are invo lved 
(the so_ca l led  "~enera l i zed  t rans format ions"  of 
ear ly  TG, Chomsky  1957:113) ;  this point is also 
d i scussed  below. Whi le  p lac ing  too many restr_  
i c t ions  on the symbols  has ser ious d i sadvant_  
ages (some of wh ich  wi l l  be d i scussed  in sect_ 
ion 2 of this paper),  it cer ta in ly  exceeds the 
capac i ty  of the model  as descr ibed  by Yngve: 
his ru les  are all of the context_  f ree form. 
Mey I0 
Thus,  s t ructure  in a su f f i c ient ly  powerfu l  
PSG is not only a mat ter  of spec i fy ing  the 
r ight  rules, but also of choos ing  the r ight 
ru les  and combin ing  them at the r ight  places. 
There  is sti l l  another  fac tor  that we have 
left  out of cons iderat ion  so far: the order_  
ing of the rules. Yngve states that any order 
wi l l  do: an a lphabet ica l  order  may be conven_ 
lent (1960:445)o NOW this has two consequen_  
ces: f irst,  all of the rules have to be run 
through every  t ime a symbol  is expanded (per_ 
haps on ly  a minor  drawback  in a computer_  
o r iented  analys is) ,  second, the advantages  of 
o rdered  rules (economy, e legancy,  accuracy)  
are lost ( " forc ing al l  k inds of low_ leve l  
deta i l  into the rules" , Bach  1964:53) . Besides,  
o rder ing  of the ru les is ind ispensab le  in 
cases  where  compl icated  h igh_ leve l  s t ructura l  
descr ip t ions  are involved:  thus an immediate  
der ivat ion  of each non_termina l  symbol  all the 
way  down to word level  would  not be permit ted 
in any k ind of PSG, not even the most context_  
sens i t ive  ones. Be ing  es~ent ia l l y  context_ f ree ,  
Yngve 's  grammar  wi l l  6~enerate what is usua l ly  
ca l led  "kernel  sentences"  (Chomsky 1963:152):  
unambiguous  der ivat ion  of more complex  struct_  
urea (der ived sentences)  wi l l  on ly  be feas ib le  
under  a careful  spec i f i ca t ion  of the order  in 
wh ich  the rules have to apply  (as an example,  
cf. the d i scuss ion  of w__hh_transformations as 
depend ing  on the in ter rogat ive  t rans format ion  
in Chomsky  1963:140). 
Mey ii 
There  is another  way out of the d i f f i cu l t ies  
that have been sketched in this sect ion: phrase_ 
s t ructur i z ing  at d i f fe rent  levels,  these be ing 
kept together  by the representat ion  re la t ion  
(see Sga l l  1964b). Th is  so lu t ion  is based  on 
a somewhat  d i f fe rent  in terprd~t ion  of PSG 
funct ions  (not only  syntact ic ,  but also semant_  
ic ru les  az'e inc luded);  a PDS is coup led  w i th  
the PSG of the lowest level.  A deta i led  d is_  
cuss lon  of this system wi l l  have to wait for 
more deta i l s ,  but it seems that grammars  based 
on dependency  re la t ions  have rece ived  too 
l i t t le  a t tent ion  so far (for a compal i son  of 
IC and dependency  theor ies ,  see Hays 1964: 
519_22)o 
1.4. Grammar  and psycho lqgy  
Refer r ing  to exper iments  per formed by G.Ao 
Mi l l~r ,  Yngve es tab l i shes  an analogy between 
the "depth"  of memory  ~n the human bra in  and 
the depth  of sentence const ruct ion  in the model  
(1960:452) .  The human bra in  is not capable  of 
s tv r lng  more than, say, seven plus minus two 
i tems a t a time (for re ferences ,  see Yngve 
ib id.) .  In  other words, the human bra in  has a 
l im i ted  capacity,  just l ike the temporary  mem_ 
ory of Yngve 's  machine.  One of the cond i t ions  
to be put on a f lawless  hand l ing  of "deep" 
const ruct ions  is that the storage capac i ty  is 
not exceeded by the number  of symbols  to be 
deve loped later on. In this connect ion  Yngve 
makes the in~ere~t ing  observat ion  that senten_  
ces and const ruct ions  in genera l  ac tua l ly  do 
Mey 12 
have a sort of l imi ted depth,  i.e. the number  
of regress ive  nodes is bound by more or less 
the same uoper  l imit as that for human memory 's  
s imu l taneous  storage caoac i ty .  
Now, I th ink  that the ana logy  between the two 
k inds  of "storage" should  not be overs t ressed.  
It rests  p r imar i l y  on the tacit assumpt ion  
that the model  should,  or could, be cons idered  
as a more or less t rue_ to_ l i fe  representat ion  
of human l ingu is t ic  act iv i ty .  As I have remark_  
ed before,  this suppos i t ion  is a l together  
ground less ,  and wi l l  at best hamper  an exola_  
nat ion  of such act iv i ty  in t ru ly  l ingu is t i c  
terms. A remark  made by Yn{~ve in this connect_  
ion may c la r i fy  the issue. Yngve says (1960: 
452b; see also 1961:135_6  for an even more ex_ 
p l ic i t  commitment) :  
"The depth  l im i ta t ion  does not apply  to a lgebra,  
for example,  because it is not a spoken langua_ 
ge. The user  has paper ava i lab le  for tempmrary  
s torage . " 
But so has the user  of any other  language,  e.g, 
human everyday sooken language.  The fact that 
we do not use paper ac tua l ly  when speak ing  has 
noth ing  to do wi th  greater  or lesser  depth  of 
sentences  (or, if it does, the depth  d i f fe rences  
occur  only  to one side, namely  that of decreas_  
ing depth) .  One could pursue this ana logy ad ab_ 
surdum by assuming two k inds  of depth,  one un_ 
l imited,  for wr i t ten  languages,  and one l imited, 
for spoken languages.  The resu l ts  would  be d is_  
ast rous  for any descr ip t ion  of any language: 
sentences  of the type: "That that that they are 
Mey 13 
both  isosceles is true is obvious isn't  c lear"  
(Yngve 1960:458b)  are as ungrammat ica l  in 
wr i t ten  as they are in spoken Eng l i sh .  Of  
course  Yngve is perfect ly  r ight in a t t r ibut_  
ing the d i f fe rence  between the above non_ 
grammat ica l  (deep regress iv~ that_c lause  and 
its g rammat ica l  (p rogress ive)  counterpart:  
"It isn't  c lear  that it is obv ious  that it 
is true that they are both  i sosce les"  to ex_ 
cess depth. So, there is a depth  l im i ta t ion  
and this l im i ta t ion  is g ramat ica l ly  re levant .  
But this l ingu is t i ca l ly  f ru i t fu l  concept  should 
not be confounded w i th  hypotheses  f rom des_ 
c r ip t ive  psychology.  
That  the c la im for descr ip t ive  s imi la r i ty  be_ 
tween psycho logy  and l ingu is t i cs  is latent in 
Yngve 's  model  can be seen from another  instan_ 
ce. \]Iis second assumpt ion  for the model  (1960: 
445) is that "the model  should share with the 
human speaker  o.. the prooer ty  that words are 
{~roduced one at a t ime in the proper  time se_ 
quence,  that is, in le f t _ to , r ight  order  ..." 
(the f irst assumpt ion ,  vim. that any shortcom_ 
ings of the PS model  can be overcome,  has Dart_ 
1y been  deal t  w i th  above ,  and wi l l  be t reated 
at length in the second ha l f  of this paper). 
Th is  rest r i c t ion ,  I think, on a model  (or a 
grammar,  insofar  as the grammar  is based  on 
the model)  is unnecessary  and se l f_contrad ict_  
ory. It is unnecessary ,  since the model  should 
on ly  copy re levant  t ra i ts  in the speech  pro_ 
duct ion  of the ind iv idua l ;  and even though it 
may be true that words are produced in a l inear  
Hey 14 
sequence  (as  a l ready  Saussure  has remarked) ,  i t  
has not yet been  shown how this l inear i ty  is to 
be in terpreted  in human speech  product ion:  I 
th ink  it is on ly  weak ly  re levant ,  that is to 
ssy, l inear i ty  a lone wi l l  never  suf f ice  to 
g ive a complete  p ic ture  of the speech  event.  
For a fu l l _ f ledged descr ip t ion  of speech I 
suppose the assumpt ion  that we speak in senten_  
cesra  ther  than in words  wi l l  have many advant_  
ages .  
Moreover ,  the c la im that the model  should  du_ 
p l icate  the proper ty  of le f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct_  
ion in the human speaker  cannot  be brought  to 
harmon2ze w i th  the model .  In fact, the model  can 
on ly  examine  one symbol  at a time: the mach ine  
may erase or delete or read only that sect ion  
of the memory  tape that is c losest  to the roll, 
i.e. the lef tmost  symbol  on ly  (Yngve 196o:446) .  
Now, the l im i ta t ion  of human memory  is on re_ 
I)roducing more than a cer ta in  number  of i tems 
at the same time. The ana logy  c lear ly  does not 
ho ld  between human memory  and mach ine  storage: 
the exp lanat ion  is that the machine produces 
symbols ,  whereas  the speech  of humans is s t ruct_

ion may in many cases be exp la ined  by a l inear  
s t ruc ture  in the oroducer ;  the pushdown store 
is a l inear  memory  dev ice .  But there are other  
le f t _ to_ r ight  p roduct ions  that are s t ruc tured  
in such a way that a PDS or other  le f t _ to_ r ight  
a r rangements  wi l l  not suf f ice.  It is of course 
true that  a s t ructura l  descr ip t ion  is not a l to_

produces  as its output a s t r ing of symbols

(S~al l  1963:41) ,  but on ly  inso far  as the st ruct_  
ure can be descr ibed  in one_ leve l  terms,  cf. 
d i scuss ion  above (see also Sgal l  1963; 1964a).  
The quest ion  wi l l  be t reated  at l ength  in part 
two of this paper.

2.1. The  subscr ip t  notat ion  
The subscr ip t  method re fer red  to here is not 
in the f i rst  p lace thought  of a s a mach ine  
v 
program (even though its c lose a f f in i ty  ~ i th  
the computer  language COMIT  is asser ted,  see 
Harman 1963:608fn . ) .  Accord ing ly ,  i t  has a 
more genera l  scope: namely ,  to o f fer  a fu l l_  
f ledged a l ternat ive ,  in PS form, to o ther  
grammars  (e.g. of t rans formst lona l  obed ience) ,  
thereby  prov ing  that " t rans format iona l  g ramm_ 
ar has no adva ntage over  the phrase s t ruct_  
ure grammar"  (Harman 1963:598) .  
? ubscr ip ts  are added to the PSG ru les  in two 
ways: f irst,  to in t roduce  res t r i c t ions  on such 
ru les,  second, to s:~ecify where those res t r_  
i c t ions  apply. An example  of the f i rst  k ind 
is the rule S --> S1 /NUMBER_SG (Harman 1963:609) ,  
and, in general ,  any rule of  the type A --> B/J 
+ o,o . The second case obta ins  e.g. in the 
fo l low ing  rule: NP/NOT_WI{ --> DETERMINER + NOUN, 
and, of course,  in all ru les  where subscr ip ts  
Mey 16 
a re " lost"  dur ing  expans ion .  I th ink  there wi l l  
be a th i rd type as well,  even t|iough this is not 
express ly  ment ioned in the ar t icLe ,  namely,  sub_ 
scr ipts  that do both: in t roduce  new subscr ip ts  
at p laces ind icated  by old ones;  but this is on_ 
ly a minor  point .  More impor tant  is the obser_  
vat ion  that subscr ip ts  can take care of all 
sorts  of const  itueJlts, both  cont inuous  and d is_  
cont inuous .  For  the latter,  the generat ion  ru_ 
les are adapted  Prom rules suggested  by V ic tor  
Yngve (IIarman 1963:606;  the re ference  quoted  is 
Yngve  1960). L ike  in Yngve 's  model ,  the rules 
of PSG/S  are unordered:  all necessary  in fo rma_  
t ion about when and where to a'iply a rule is 
conta ined  in the subscr ip ts  (which, by  the way 
and perhaps a for t io r i ,  are said to occur  in an 
unordered  sequence) .  But, as w i l l  be seen f rom 
the fo l low ing  paFsgraphs,  this "when"and "where" 
is not on ly  a notat iona l  problem: in fact, it 
is one of the b ig  under ly ing  d i f fe rences  be_ 
tween PSG and TG. (0n the d i f f i cu l ty  of o rder ing  
ru les in a PSG, see Chomsky  1957:35) .  A fu r ther  
impor tant  d i f fe rence  f rom other  PSG in terpreta_  
t ions is the admiss ion  of de le t ion  rules, that 
is ru les  of the form A --> @ (Harman 1963:60~); 
also this point  wi l l  be d i scussed  at length below.  
2.2 .  Subscr ip ts  And Trans format ions  
In general ,  One cannot deny  the poss ib i l i ty  of 
incorporat ing  (by means of subscr ip ts  or other  
dev ices)  some of the in fo rmat ion  that is con_ 
ta ined in a t rans format iona l  g rammar  into a 
Mey 17 
~ne_ leve l  g rammar  of PS type. 
But the grammar  thus const ructed  w i l l  never  
generate  all  and on ly  the grammat ica l  sent_  
enc~s of the language.  E i ther  it wi l l  generate  
too l i t t le  (the normal  case for PSG wi thout  
subscr ip ts  or s imi la r  dev ices )  or, if it gen_  
erates more,  it wi l l  a lso generate  some non_ 
grammat ica l  sentences  (Harman 1963:611:" . . .  
not all sentences  const ructed  in accordance  
w i th  this g rammar  'are we l l _ fo rmed." )  
A very  s imole  example wi l l  show this. Supoose  
we ~ant to t rans form opt iona l ly  a sentence in_ 
to its quest ion  counterpar t .  To do this in the 
PSG/S  accord ing  to Harman,  we have to choose  
an appropr ia te  expans ion  of  the symbol  $2 
(the same paths hold for number_  and mode_  
res t r i c ted  S : S1, resp. S2, Harman:600) ,  na_ 
mely  e i ther  the second or the four th  rule in 
3., the set of expans ion  ru les  for $2. We 
choose the second rule (normal  quest ion ,  the 
four th  rule concerns  wh_quest ions) :  
S2 --> VP /TYPE_QUES,NOT_WH + NP/CASE_NOM,NOT_WH.  
Now, note  two things: in o rder  to conform to 
the ru les  for this grammar ,  we have a l ready  
added some of  the subscr ip ts  f rom Rules  1 and 
2 to the symbol  $2 (e.g., NUMBER_SG and MODE_ACT) .  
These  subscr ip ts ,  together  w i th  the new ones, 
are to appear  on every  symbol  that is conta ined  
in every  ru le  f rom now on (unless a de le te  sub_ 
scr ipt  is in t roduced,  cf. be low) .  Th is  is nec_  
essary,  s ince we cannot let any in fo rmat ion  that 
is conveyed by the subscr ip ts  be lost, even if 
Mey 18 
it be i r re levant  to the symbol  in quest ion  (such 
as, say, a MODE res t r i c t ion  on a NP).  One can 
eas i ly  imagine that rewr i te  ru les  of this type 
soon become very  unwie ldy  ( even if we do not 
a l low ,u rse lves  to be f r ightened by the prospects  
of "mi l l i ons  of rules",  Harman:605) .  Thus, in 
rule 7 of this comparat ive ly  s imple  grammar  we 
a l ready  have 6 subscr ip ts  to each symbol.  Th is  
number  is substant ia l l y  inc reased  in the more 
e laborate  vers ion  of the grammar  (see Append ix  
to Harman 's  ar t ic le) .  Th is  is cer ta in ly  not 
what one would  cal l  s imp l i c i ty  of descr ip t ion .  
\[Jut ob jec t ions  of this k ind can be met by the 
fo l low ing  cons iderat iun :  even if  the mul t iD l i _  
ca t ion  of entia,  i.c. symbols  and subscr ipts ,  
seems wi thout  ra t iona le  for humans,  one can 
conce ive  of it as 8 necess i ty  for computer  data  
handl ing,  and the computer  cer ta in ly  does not 
mind go ing  through all the subscr ip ts ,  add ing  
some, de le t ing  others,  etc.,  every  time a sym_ 
bol  is ment ioned  or expanded.  So, if one has a 
work ing  program in wh ich  these res t r i c t ions  can 
he wr i t ten  out as subrout ines ,  and if the com_ 
i)uter space needed does not exceed that ava i l _  
able, the ob jec t ion  just made does not hold 
(cf. Harman:61Ofn . :  "Many of these grammars  are 
in the form of computer  programs for generat ing  
actual  sentences . " )  
The other  quest ion  is far more important. It can 
be spl i t  up into ~?o parts: 
i. Can all the data  of the grammar  be put into 
the subscr ip t_ res t r i c t ion  schema? 
2. Wi l l  the subscr ip t_ res t r i c t ion  schema not 
Mey 19 
put more data  into my grammar  than wnnted?  
The f i rst  quest ion  concerns  the adequate  re_ 
presentation of the structure, the o ther  ex_ 
presses  the fear that I may add s t ruc ture  to 
my grammar,  thus oroduc in~ sentences  that are 
not  g rammat ica l  (see Chomsky  1962:514f f . )  
Adopt in~ a d i s t inc t ion  made by Chomsky,  I 
make the fo l low ing  assert ion:  A PSG/S  wi l l  serve 
as a more or less adequate  observat iona l  and 
descr ip t ive  representat ion  of the facts  covered  
by a normal  PSG; as far as TG is concerndd,  the 
s t ruc ture  of the t rans format iona l  mode l  (how 
t rees  mad into trees)  wi l l  not be represented  
adequate ly  on the descr ip t ive  (and perhaps  not 
even on the observat iona l )  level by  a PSG/S.  
In no case the PSG/S  wi l l  a t ta in  the level  of 
exp lanatory  adequacy.  
The f i rs t  Dart of my asser t ion  can eas i ly  be 
proved  f rom the observat ion  that a normal  PSG 
and a PSG/S  are s t rong ly  equ iva lent  grammars ,  
the on ly  d i f fe rence  be ing  the notat ion .  (On the 
not ion  of equ iva lence ,  of. also Hays 1965:519). 
In fact,  it makes no d i f fe rence  whether  one ex_ 
pands a symbol  on the bas is  of a ru le  to be af_ 
f i xed  to the const i tuent  by  means of a sub_ 
scr ipt ,  or on the bas is  of a rule conta ined  so_ 
mewhere  else in the grammar.  The essent ia l  is 
that  ~erat ion  proceeds  f rom left to r ight,  and 
one symbol  is F)roduced at a time. (See d i scuss_  
ion above, 1.2). 
To Drove the other  ha l f  of the asser t ion  male 
above,  I wi l l  try to give an answer  to the two_ 
MeT 20 
fo ld quest ion  about representat ion  of s t ruc t_  
ure. Let ' s  go back  to the e lementary  example  
of the opt iona l  T , and try to imag ine  how this q 
is hand led  in a PSG/S.  The  main  d i f fe rence  be_ 
tween PSG and TG is that the ru les  in PSG oper_ 
ate on symbols ,  in TG on s t r ings  of symbols .  
When I put a subscr ip t  on a symbol  that is part 
of a str ing,  and I want  to mark  off  a s t ruc t_  
ure that is based  on severa l  symbols  occur r ing  
in a cer ta in  order, I w i l l  have to mark  a Ii 
the symbo ls  of my s t r ing  in the same way ,  and 
this way  of :~larking must  be unique,  i.e. de_ 
f ine a un ique path through the rules.  Th is  path 
may, in due course,  requ i re  add i t ions ,  de le t ions ,  
permutations and the like. Now, in TG these op_ 
era t ions  are car r ied  out a f ter  the PS der iv&t ion  
has been completed.  In PSG/S,  ho~Tever, the 
c leavage between a f f i rmat ive  and in ter rogat ive  
sentences  occurs  a l ready  in the th i rd  rule, 
where  $2 is expanded into NP + VP, VP + NP, 
respect ive ly  (omit t ing  the subscr ip ts ) .  The 
two der ivat ions  fo l low separate  paths through 
the rules:  in terms of tree d iagrams,  what  is 
left  in the one is r ight  in the other  of the 
two trees,  In this way, many PSG ru les  are un_ 
necessar i l y  dup l i ca ted  (see above);  moreover ,  
the re la t ionsh ip  between in ter rogat ive  and de_ 
c la ra~ive  sentences,  as de f ined  in TG, is reduced 
to a remote  common source of der ivat ion ,  namely  
$2. It is not true that "Sentences  are ~rans_  
fo rmat iona l ly  re lated'  to the extent  that the 
Mey 21 
same cho ice  of res t r i c t ions  is made in the i r  
der ivat ions  and if the same lexical  c',oices 
are made where i~ossible" (Harman:608{ s inc le  
quotes  are his), un less  one takes " ' t rans for_  
mat iona l ly  re la ted ' "  in a sense ra ther  d i f fe r_  
ent f rom Chomsky 's ,  namely:  sentences  that have 
a (part ia l )  oath through the ru les in common. 
Th is  is, in fact, the only ' t rans format iona l  
re la t ion '  that it is poss ib le  to de f ine  in a 
PSG/S,  but unfor tunate ly ,  it is not t rans for_  
mat iona l .  Even  in the case that two paths coin_ 
cide, and co inc ide  a l together ,  we do not have 
' t rans format iona l  re la tedness ' ,  but "grammat ica l  
s imi la r i ty"  (Harman:6OS) .  Lex iea l  cho ices  have 
noth ing  to do wi th  this re lat ion:  both  in PSG 
and in rG the cho ice  on the lexical  level is 
made a f ter  the aoDl i ca t ion  of expans ion,  reso_ 
ec t ive ly  t rans format iona l  rules. (This is not 
a l together  cor~.ect: lex ica l  cho ices  may be made 
ear l ie r  and thus af fect  the der ivat ion ,  but 
this is bes ide  the point; complex  symbols  (see 
K l ima 1964) are not taken  into cons iderat ion  
here, but they cou ld  be bui l t  into a PSG as 
wel l  as into any o ther  generat ive  grammar.  I 
think,  e.g., that some com,~lex symbol  could be 
dev ised  to prevent  sentences  l ike The man 
wa lks  the men, that cou ld  eas i ly  be generated  
in accordance  wi th  the rules descr ibed  on TIp. 
609_10 of Harmsn 's  ar t i c le . )  
In my opinion,  a PSG/S  wi l l  never  be able to 
show t rans format iona l  re la t ionsh ips  as fo rmal ly  
de f ined  and descr ibed  by Chomsky  and oZhers;  
hence such a grammar,  even though it may at ta in  
Mey 22 
a cer ta in  descr ip t ive  adequacy ,  w i l l  never  g ive  
an exp lanat ion  of  the fac t  that  p rec i se ly  this,  
and not  some other  sentence ,  is t~ans formed 
in to  another  s t ruc ture .  
2o3.  De le t ion  in a PSG 
Another  d i f f i cu l ty  in PSG/S  concerns  the prob lem 
of de le t ion  ru les .  In  normal  PSG, no de le tes  
are permi t ted  (Chomsky  1961:9)o  Harman g ives  as 
reason  for  th is  res t r i c t ion  that t rees  must  be 
un ique ly  recoverab le  in a I~SG (p.603) .  Th is  is, 
however ,  on ly  part  of  the mot ivat ion .  De le tes  
are not symbols :  they cannot  be expanded (un_ 
less one chooses  to ex~)and them into  de le tes ,  
wh ich  is obv ious ly  use less  in a descr ip t ion)?  
Whenever  a de le t ion  ru le  occurs ,  the s t ruc ture  
of  the  der ivate  is a l te red  in such a way that 
ru les  may a~ply  wh ich  or ig ina l ly  shou ld  not.  
One cou ld  say that de le tes  are ext remely  con_  
text_sens i t i ve :  in !{at;nan's PSG/S ,  wh ich  in 
rea l i ty  is a h igh ly  res t r i c ted  PSG, the number  
of ru les  hav ing  the fo rm A- -> Z is very  l im i ted  
indeed,  even  though the author  advocates  the i r  
use  (9 .605) .  In pass ing ,  I wou ld  l ike  to remark  
that near ly  al l  o f  the de le t ion  ru les  have to 
do w i th  the ex,oansion of  NP/I~H ( th i s  subscr ip t  
occurs  on ly  once in the smal le r  ~rammar ,  p.609, 
and shou ld  there fore  be re jec ted  by the mach ine ,  
s ince  there  are no const i tuents  on wh ich  the 
ru le  cou ld  a~ply . )  
The  rea l  reason  why  a de le te  cannot  be admi t ted  
in a PSG (espec ia l l y  a h igh ly  context_sens i t i ve  
Hey 23 
one) is that  the ru les  fo l low ing  the de le t ion  
ru les  shou ld  be mod i f ied  or alte~'ed complete ly  
, o therw ise  it wou ld  not  be poss ib le  to keep  
the d i s t inc t ion  between not_ rewr i t ten  and re_ 
wr i t ten  symbo ls  c lear:  the ru les  fo l low ing  de_  
le t ion  might  thus operate  on symbo ls  or i f~inal ly  
be long ing  to the context .  (Note,  by the x?ay, 
that  in the case  of wh_words  the context  l~ro_ 
b lem is somewhat  s imp l i f ied  by  the fact  that  
these  words  normal ly  s tand at the beg inn ing  
of  a sentence ,  so that the le f t  context  can  
be thought  of as zero . )  In  our  example ,  the 
t rans format iona l  ru le  for  in ter rogat ive  sent_  
ences  to be generated  f rom dec la ra t ive  ones 
operates  on a s t r ing  of  symbo ls  that  may be 
symbo l i zed  X 1 _ X 2 _ X 3 (Chomsky  1957: i12) ,  
car ry ing  it into the shade  X 2 _ X I - X 3. 
Now, suppose  that in the course  of  the der iv_  
Rt ion  to non_termins l  symbo ls  (the kerne l  
s t r ing)  we have a de le t lon  ru le  operat ing ,  say, 
on "( Suppose  moreover  that  the non_termina l  
i ? 
symbo l  fo l low ing  X 3 qua l i f i es  for  the cond i_  
t ions  o r ig ina l ly  put on X 5. The  t rans format io_  
nal  ru le  w i l l  then  operate  on a s t r ing  X 2 _ 
X~ _ X4, and car ry  it into  X 3 _X 2 _ X~, thus 
generat ing  a non_grammat ica l  sentence .  I do 
not  p re tend  that the ac tua l  PSG/S  as Drooosed  
and descr ibed  by Harman in his a r t i c le  ~,,ill 
generate  these  sentences :  as a l ready  sai~l, the 
grammar  makes  a very  caut ious  use of  de le t ions ,  
so that  sentences  l ike the ones  ment ioned  w i l l  
not  occur .  Th is  does  not,  ho~,yever, inva l idate  
the c r i t i c i sm.  
Mey 24 
Subscr ip ts  may not only  be added in A PSG/S, 
but also de le ted .  In this manner  a res t r i c t ion  
that has been put on a cer ta in  rule can be re_ 
moved (this de le t ion  of subscr ip ts  is of course  
qu i te  another  mat ter  than the de le t ion  of sym_ 
bols  d i scussed  above).  Subscr ip ts  may be su)er_  
f luous, such as in Rule 8.1 (p.609),  where 
the subscr ip t  AUX_MODAL is removed f rom the 
const i tuent  INF IN IT IVE  by the subscr ip t  
--AUX_MODAL, even though the lex icon  would o f fe r  
no ambiguous  rewr i tes  in the case of a non_ 
removal  of the super f luous  subscr ip t .  One could 
perhaps wonder  why this p recaut ion  is taken, 
s ince in many other  ins tances  super f luous  sub_ 
scr ipts  pers is t  all the way through the der iva_  
t ion (see d i scuss ion  above).  In other  cases, 
the removal  of subscr ip ts  can be mot ivated  
by the des i re  to orevent ungrammat ica l  " loops",  
i.e. end less  recurs ive  expans ions  that have no 
jus t i f i ca t ion  in the grammar.  Thus  in Rule 8ol 
the symbol VP3/AUX_MODAL is expanded into 
INF IN IT IVE /? . .  + VP3/AUX_HAVE, - -AUY_MODAL,  thus 
prevent ing  another  expans ion  by the same rule 
of VP 3. If, on the other  hand, we w ish  the 
symbol  in quest ion  to be expanded recurs ive ly  
(and accord ing  to the latest develo,)ment in TG 
there should be no d i f f i cu l ty  in admi t t ing  
recurs lv i ty  for all symbols,  S not excluded: 
see K l ima 1964),  we can res tar t  the cycle by 
w ip ing  our s late,  i.e. de le t ing  all the sub_ 
scr ipts  by means  of the ins t ruct ion  ERASE.0TIIERS, 
to be incorporated  as a subscr ip t  on the r ight 
Mey 25 
hand side of the ruleo Natura l ly ,  we wou ld  ex_ 
pect a subscr ipt  of this k ind to occur  in those 
cases  where a who le  sentence  is to be embedded 
into another  hy means of what in ear ly  TG was 
ca l led  "genera l i zed  t rans format ions"  (Chomsky 
1957: 113) o Th~omina l i z ing  t rans format ion  is 
an ins tance  i~ ind"  under  ~g in the extended 
PSG/S  (p.613), we find, among others ,  the entry: 
NP8 --> S l /CLAUSE.  TYPE:NOMINAL IZAT ION,  SUBJ. INo 
GENIT IVE,  B, C ,D,E, Z,Y, ERASEoOTHERS 
This  means that all the subscr ip ts  o r ig ina l ly  
found on NP8 are to be deleted;  the new sub_ 
sc r ip ts  deal  exc lus ive ly  w i th  the der ivat ion  
of the embedded c lause  (as can eas i ly  be ver i_  
f led from the ru les  of  the PSG/S  as g iven  in 
the Append ix  of the art ic le) .  1~'hereas TG keeps 
t rack  of the chan~es to be made by means of a 
s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ion  of the pair  of  kerne l  
sentences  involved,  together  wi th  a fo rmula  for 
sh~/ctural change,  in PSG/S  we have only  a con_ 
s t i tuent  NP to be expanded by means of DS rules? 
How this NP f its into the s tmucture  of the ori_ 
g ina l  kerne l  sentence  (being essent ia l l y  its 
path through the PS der ivat ion)  can be fo\] low_ 
ed in .nSG by t rac ing back  the nodes of the tree 
representat ion .  In PSG/S,  this path is marked 
by the subscr io ts  added to the NP in quest ion .  
Now, all this in fo rmat ion  is s t ruck  f rom the 
record  by the remova l  of the subscr ip ts  in 
ac,:ordance w i th  the ins t ruct ion  ERASE OTHERS? 
~st ruCtura l  descri!)t ion of the sentence  as a

It is as if we ha~een expand ing  a const i tuent

2o Conc lus ion  
Of  the two models  d i scussed  here, the f irst  one 
(PSG/PDS)  has not ac tua l ly  been proposed as a 
fu l l _sca le  grammat ica l  mo:Iel, but I have tr ied 
to show that the imp l i ca t ions  of the c la im 
that any shorgcomings  of PSG can be ow:rcome 
lead to d i f f i cu l t ies  of about  the same nature  
as those encountered  in the second molel  (PSG/S). 
Descr ip t ive  adequacy  is not a t ta ined  in those
