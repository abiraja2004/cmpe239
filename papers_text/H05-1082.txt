Abstract 
This paper reports a preliminary study 
addressing two challenges in measuring 
the effectiveness of information extrac-
tion (IE) technology: 
? Developing a methodology for ex-
trinsic evaluation of IE; and, 
? Estimating the impact of improving 
IE technology on the ability to per-
form an application task. 
The methodology described can be em-
ployed for further controlled experi-
ments regarding information extraction. 
1 Introduction 
Intrinsic evaluations of information extraction 
(IE) have a history dating back to the Third Mes-
sage Understanding Conference1 (MUC-3) and 
continuing today in the Automatic Content Ex-
traction (ACE) evaluations.2  Extrinsic evalua-
tions of IE, measuring the utility of IE in a task, 
are lacking and needed (Jones, 2005).   
In this paper, we investigate an extrinsic 
evaluation of IE where the task is question an-
swering (QA) given extracted information.  In 
addition, we propose a novel method for explor-
ing hypothetical performance questions, e.g., if 
IE accuracy were x% closer to human accuracy, 
how would speed and accuracy in a task, e.g., 
QA, improve?

We plot QA accuracy and time-to-complete 
given eight extracted data accuracy levels rang-
ing from the output of SERIF, BBN?s state-of-
the-art IE system, to manually extracted data. 
2 Methodology 
Figure 1 gives an overview of the methodol-
ogy. The left portion of the figure shows source 
documents provided both to a system and a hu-
man to produce two extraction databases, one 
corresponding to SERIF?s automated perform-
ance and one corresponding to double-
annotated, human accuracy.  By merging por-
tions of those two sources in varying degrees 
(?blends?), one can derive several extracted da-
tabases ranging from machine quality, through 
varying percentages of improved performance, 
up to human accuracy. This method of blending 
databases provides a means of answering hypo-
thetical questions, i.e., what if the state-of-the-
art were x% closer to human accuracy, with a 
single set of answer keys. 
A person using a given extraction database 
performs a task, in our case, QA.  The measures 
of effectiveness in our study were time to com-
plete the task and percent of questions answered 
correctly.  An extrinsic measure of the value of 
improved IE technology performance is realized 
by rotating users through different extraction 
databases and questions sets.   
In our preliminary study, databases of fully 
automated IE and manual annotation (the gold 
standard) were populated with entities, relation-
ships, and co-reference links from 946 docu-
ments. The two initial databases representing 
machine extraction and human extraction re-
spectively were then blended to produce a con-
tinuum of database qualities from machine to 
652
human performance. ACE Value Scores3 were 
measured for each database. Pilot studies were 
conducted to develop questions for a QA task. 
Each participant answered four sets of questions, 
each with a different extraction database repre-
senting a different level of IE accuracy. An an-
swer capture tool recorded the time to answer 
each question and additional data to confirm that 
the participant followed the study protocol. The 
answers were then evaluated for accuracy and 
the relationship between QA performance and 
IE quality was established.  
Each experiment used four databases. The first ex-
periment used databases spanning the range from 
solely machine extraction to solely human extraction. 
Based on the results of this experiment, two further 
experiments focused on smaller ranges in database 
quality to study the relationship between IE and QA 
performance.  
2.1 Source Document Selection, Annota-
tion, and Extraction 
Source documents were selected based on the 
availability of manual annotation.  We identified 
946 broadcast news and newswire articles from 
recent ACE efforts, all annotated by the LDC 
according to the ACE guidelines for the relevant 
year (2002, 2003, 2004). Entities, relations, and 
within-document co-reference were marked.  
Inter-document co-reference annotation was 
added by BBN.  The 946 news articles com-
prised 363 articles (187,720 words) from news-
wire and 583 (122,216 words) from broadcast 
news. With some corrections to deal with errors 
and changes in guidelines, the annotations were 
loaded as the human (DB-quality 100) database. 
                                                          
3 The 2004 ACE evaluation plan, available at 
http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/ace04/doc/ace04-evalplan-
v7.pdf, contains a full description of the scoring metric used in the 
evaluation.  Entity type weights were 1 and the level weights were 
NAM=1.0, NOM=0.5, and PRO=0.1. 
SERIF, BBN?s automatic IE system based on its 
predecessor, SIFT (Miller, 2000), was run on the 
946 ACE documents to create the machine (DB-
quality 0) database. SERIF is a statistically 
trained software system that automatically per-
forms entity, co-reference, and relationship in-
formation extraction. 
Intermediate IE performance was simulated 
by blending the human and automatically gener-
ated databases in various degrees using an inter-
polation algorithm developed specifically for 
this study. To create a blended database, DB-
quality n, all of the entities, relationships, and 
co-reference links common to the human and 
automatically generated databases are copied 
into a new one. Then, n% of the entity mentions 
in the human database (100), but not in the 
automatic IE system output (0), are copied; and, 
(100 ? n)% of the entity mentions in the auto-
matically generated database, but not in the hu-
man database, are copied. Next, the relationships 
for which both of the constituent entity mentions 
have been copied are also copied to the blended 
database. Finally, co-reference links and entities 
for the already copied entity mentions are copied 
into the blended database. 
For the first experiment, two intermediate ex-
traction databases were created: DB-qualities 33 
and 67. For the second experiment, two addi-
tional databases were created: 16.5 and 50. The 
first intermediate databases were both created 
using the 0 and 100 databases as seeds. The 16.5 
database was created by mixing the 0 and the 33 
databases in a 50% blend. The 50 database was 
created by doing the same with the 33 and 67 
databases.  For Experiment 3, 41 and 58 data-
bases were created by mixing the 33 and 50, and 
50 and 67 databases respectively.

Table 2: Entity, Relation and Description Counts for each DB Blend 
 
To validate the interpolation algorithm and 
blending procedure, we applied NIST?s 2004 
ACE Scorer to the eight extraction databases. 
Polynomial approximations were fitted against 
both the entity and relation extraction curves. 
Entity performance was found to vary linearly 
with DB blend (R2 = .9853) and relation per-
formance was found to vary with the square of 
DB blend (R2 = .9961). Table 1 shows the scores 
for each blend, and Table 2 shows the counts of 
entities, relationships, and descriptions. 
2.2 Question Answering Task 
Extraction effectiveness was measured by how 
well a person could answer questions given a 
database of facts, entities, and documents. Par-
ticipants answered four sets of questions using 
four databases. They accessed the database using 
BBN?s FactBrowser (Miller, 2001) and recorded 
their answers and source citations in a separate 
tool developed for this study, AnswerPad. 
Each database represented a different data-
base quality. In some databases, facts were miss-
ing, or incorrect facts were recorded. 
Consequently, answers were more accessible in 
some databases than in others, and participants 
had to vary their question answering strategy 
depending on the database. 
Participants were given five minutes to an-
swer each question. To ensure that they had ac-
tually located the answer rather than relied on 
world knowledge, they were required to provide 
source citations for every answer. The instruc-
tions emphasized that the investigation was a 
test of the system, and not of their world knowl-
edge or web search skills. Compliance with 
these instructions was high. Users resorted to 
knowledge-based proper noun searches only one 
percent of the time. In addition, keyword search 
was disabled to force participants to rely on the 
database features. 
2.3 Participants 
Study participants were recruited through local 
web lists and at local colleges and universities.  
Participants were restricted to college students 
and recent graduates with PC (not Mac) experi-
ence, without reading disabilities, for whom 
English was their native language. No other 
screening was necessary because the design 
called for each participant to serve as his or her 
own control, and because opportunities to use 
world knowledge in answering the questions 
were minimized through the interface and pro-
cedures. 
During the first two months of the study 23 
participants were used to help develop questions, 
participant criteria, and the overall test proce-
dure. Then, experiments were conducted com-
paring the 0, 33, 67, and 100 database blends 
(Experiment 1, 20 subjects); the 0, 16.5, 33, and 
50 database blends (Experiment 2, 20 subjects), 
and the 33, 41, 50, and 58 database blends (Ex-
periment 3, 24 subjects).

2.4 Question Selection and Validation 
Questions were developed over two months of 
pilot studies. The goal was to find a set of ques-
tions that would be differentially supported by 
the 0, 33, 67, and 100 databases. We explored 
both ?random? and ?engineered? approaches. 
The random approach called for creating ques-
tions using only the documents, without refer-
ence to the kind of information extracted. Using 
a list of keywords, one person generated 86 
questions involving relationships and entities 
pertaining to politics and the military by scan-
ning the 946 ACE documents to find references 
to each keyword and devising questions based 
on the information she found.  
The alternative, engineered approach involved 
eliminating questions that were not supported by 
the types of information extracted by SERIF, 
and generating additional questions to fit the 
desired pattern of increasing support with in-
creased human annotation. This approach en-
sured that the question sets reflected the 
structural differences that are assumed to exist in 
the database, and produced psychophysical data 
that link degree of QA support to human per-
formance parameters. The IE results from four 
of the databases (0, 33, 67 and 100) were used to 
develop questions that received differential sup-
port from the different quality databases. For 
example, such a question could be answered us-
ing the automatically extracted results, but might 
be more straightforwardly answered given hu-
man annotation. 
Sixty-four questions, plus an additional ten 
practice questions, were created using the engi-
neering approach. Additional criteria that were 
followed in creating the question sets were: 1) 
Questions had to contain at least one reasonable 
entry hook into all four databases, e.g., the terms 
U.S. and America were considered too broad to 
be reasonable; and, 2) For ease of scoring, list-
type questions had to specify the number of an-
swers required. Alternative criteria were consid-
ered but rejected because they correlated with 
the aforementioned set.  The following are ex-
amples of engineered questions. 
? Identify eight current or former U.S. State 
Department workers. 
? In what two West Bank towns does Fatah 
have an office? 
? Name two countries where Osama bin 
Laden has been. 
? Were Lebanese women allowed to vote in 
municipal elections between two Shiite 
groups in the year 1998? 
Two question lists, one with 86 questions 
generated by the random procedure and one with 
64 questions generated by the engineered proce-
dure, were analyzed with respect to the degree of 
support afforded by each of the four databases as 
viewed through FactBrowser. Four a priori cri-
teria were established to assess degree of support 
? or its opposite, the degree of expected diffi-
culty ? for each question in each of the four da-
tabases. Ranked from easiest to hardest, they are 
listed in Table 3. 
The question can be answered? 
1. Directly with fact or description (answer 
is highlighted in FactBrowser citation) 
2. Indirectly with fact or description (an-
swer is not highlighted) 
3. With name mentioned in question (long 
list of mentions without context) 
4. Via database crawling 
Table 3: A Priori Question Difficulty Character-
istics, listed from easiest to hardest 
Table 4 shows the question difficulty levels 
for both question types, for each of four data-
bases. Analysis of the engineered set was done 
on all 64 questions.  Analysis for randomly gen-
erated questions was done on a random sample 
of 44 of the 86 questions.  Fifteen questions did 
not meet the question criteria, leaving 29.  
The randomly generated questions showed a 
statistically significant, but small, variation in 
expected difficulty, in part due to the number of 
unanswerable questions. While the questions 
were made up with respect to information found 
in the documents, the process did not consider 
the types of extracted entities and relations. This 
problem might have been mitigated by limiting 
the search to questions involving entities and 
relations that were part of the extraction task. 
By contrast, the engineered question set 
showed a highly significant decrease in expected 
difficulty as the percentage of human annotation 
in the database increased (P < 0.0001 for chi-
square analysis). This result is not surprising, 
given that the questions were constructed with 
reference to the list of entities in the four data-
655
bases. The analysis confirms that the experimen-
tal manipulation of different degrees of support 
provided by the four databases was achieved for 
this question set.

Table 4: Anticipated Difficulty of Questions as a 
Function of Database Quality 
Preliminary human testing with both question 
sets suggested that the a priori difficulty indica-
tors predict human question answering perform-
ance. Experiments with the randomly generated 
questions, therefore, were unlikely to reveal 
much about the databases or about human ques-
tion answering performance. On the other hand, 
an examination of how different levels of data-
base quality affect human performance, in a psy-
chophysical experiment where structure is varied 
systematically, promised to address the question 
of how much support is needed for good per-
formance. 
Based on the question difficulties, and pilot 
study timing and performance results, the 64 
questions were grouped into four, 16-question 
balanced sets. 
2.5 Procedure 
Participants were tested individually at our site, 
in sessions lasting roughly four hours. Training 
prior to the test lasted for approximately a half 
hour. Training consisted of a walk-through of 
the interface features followed by guided prac-
tice with sample questions. The test consisted of 
four question sets, each with a different data-
base.  Participants were informed that they 
would be using a different database for each 
question set and that some might be easier to use 
than others. 
Questions were automatically presented and 
responses were captured in AnswerPad, a soft-
ware tool designed for the study. AnswerPad is 
shown in Figure 2.  
Key features of the tool include: 
? Limiting view to current question set ? 
disallowing participants to view previous 
question sets 
? Automatically connecting to correct db 
? Logging time spent on each question 
? Enforcing five-minute limit per question 
? Enforcing requirement that all answers in-
clude a citation 
 
Figure 2: AnswerPad Question Presentation and 
Answer Capture Interface 
Participants were given written documenta-
tion as part of their training. The participants 
were instructed to cut-and-paste question an-
swers and document citations from source 
documents into AnswerPad. 
Extracted facts and entities, and source docu-
ments were accessed through FactBrowser. 
FactBrowser, shown in Figure 3, is web-browser 
based and is invoked via a button in AnswerPad. 
FactBrowser allows one to enter a string, which 
656
is matched against the database of entity men-
tions. The list of entities that have at least one 
mention partially matching the string are re-
turned (e.g., ?Laura Bush?) along with an icon 
indicating the type of the entity and the number 
of documents in which the entity appears.  
Clicking on the entity in the left panel causes the 
top right panel to display all of the descriptions, 
facts, and mentions for the entity. Selecting one 
of these displays citations in which the descrip-
tion, fact, or mention occurs. Clicking on the 
citation opens up a document view in the lower 
right corner of the screen and highlights the ex-
tracted information in the text. When a docu-
ment is displayed, all of the entities detected in 
the document are listed down the left side of the 
document viewer.  
 
 
Figure 3: Browsing Tool Interface 
The browsing tool was instrumented to record 
command invocations so that the path a partici-
pant took to answer a question could be recre-
ated, and the participant?s adherence to protocol 
could be verified. Furthermore, the find function 
(Ctrl-F) was disabled to prevent users from per-
forming ad hoc searches of the documents in-
stead of using the extracted data. 
The order of question sets and the order of da-
tabase conditions were counterbalanced across 
participants, so that, for every four participants, 
every question set and database appeared once in 
every ordinal position, and every question set 
was paired once with every database. This 
avoided carryover effects from question order. 
2.6 Data Collected 
Based on the initial results from Experiment 1, a 
70% target effectiveness threshold was identi-
fied to occur between the 33 and 67 database 
blends. To refine and verify this finding, Ex-
periment 2 examined the 0, 16.5, 33, and 50 da-
tabase blends. Experiment 3 examined the 33, 
41, 50, and 58 database blends. 
AnswerPad collected participant-provided an-
swers to questions and the corresponding cita-
tions. In addition, AnswerPad recorded the time 
spent answering the questions. A limit of five 
minutes was imposed based on pilot study re-
sults. The browsing tool logged commands in-
voked while the user searched the fact-base for 
question answers. Questions were manually 
scored based on the answers in the provided 
corpus. No partial credit was given. The maxi-
mum score, for each database condition, was 16, 
for a total maximum score of 64. 
3 Results 
Figure 4 shows the question answer scores 
and times for each of the three individual ex-
periments, and for Experiments 1 and 2 com-
bined. Database quality affects both task speed 
(downward-sloping line) and task accuracy (up-
ward-sloping line) in the expected direction. A 
logistic fit, as for a binary-response curve, was 
used to fit the relationship between blend per-
centage and accuracy in each experiment. The 
logistic fit Goodman-Theil quasi-R2 was .9973 
for Experiment 1, .9594 for Experiment 2, .8936 
for Experiment 3, and .9959 for Experiments 1 
and 2 combined. 
For the target accuracy of 70%, the 95% con-
fidence interval for the required blend is (35,56) 
around a predicted 46% blend for Experiment 1, 
and (41,56) around a predicted 49% for Experi-
ments 1 and 2 combined.

The downward-sloping line in each graph 
displays the average time to answer a question 
as a function of the extraction blend. For this 
analysis we used strict time, the time it took the 
participant to answer the question if he or she 
answered correctly, or the full 5 minutes allowed 
for any incorrectly answered question. This ad-
dresses the situation where a person quickly an-
swers all of the questions incorrectly.  The 
average question-answer time drops 32% as one 
moves from a machine generated extraction da-
tabase to a human generated database. A 
straight-line fit to the Experiment 1 and 2 com-
bined data predicts a drop of 6.5 seconds as the 
human proportion of the database increases by 
10 percentage points. 
A one-way repeated measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was performed for Experi-
ment 1 (0-33-67-100), Experiment 2 (0-16.5-33-

summarizes the results. In Experiments 1 and 2 
the impact of database quality on QA perform-
ance and on QA time were highly significant (P 
< 0.0001), but not for the narrower range of da-
tabases in Experiment 3. Other ANOVAs 
showed that the impact of trial order and ques-
tion set on QA performance were both non-
significant (P > 0.05).

Table 5: ANOVA Analyses for QA Performance 
Expt. 1 used db blends of 0, 33, 67, and 100% 
Expt. 2 used db blends of 0, 16.5, 33, and 50% 
Expt. 3 used db blends of 33, 41, 50, and 58% 
In Experiment 1, Newman-Keuls contrasts 
indicate that the 0, 33, 67, and 100 databases 
differ significantly (P < .05) on their impact on 
QA quality. For Experiment 2, however, the 
16.5 and 33 database qualities were not shown to 
be different, nor were any of the database blends 
in Experiment 3. The data suggest that nearly 
half the improvement in QA quality from 0 to 
100 occurs by the 33 database blend, and more 
than half the improvement in QA quality from 0 
to 50 occurs by the 16.5 blend: a little ?human? 
goes a long way. Experiment 3 suggests that 
small differences in data blends make no practi-
cal difference in the results.  Alternatively, there 
might be real differences that are small enough 
such that a larger number of participants would 
be required to detect them. Experiment 3 also 
had two participants with atypical patterns of 
QA against blend, which might account for the 
failure to detect a difference between the 33 and 
50 or 58 blends as suggested by the results from 
Experiment 2. Furthermore, larger experiments 
could reveal whether the atypical participants 
were representatives of a subpopulation, or sim-
ply outliers. Bearing the possibility of outliers in 
mind, we used the combination of Experiments 
1 and 2 for the combined logistic analysis. 
4 Conclusions 
We presented a methodology for assessing in-
formation extraction effectiveness using an ex-
trinsic study. In addition, we demonstrated how 
a novel database blending (merging) strategy 
allows interpolating extraction quality from 
automated performance up through human accu-
racy, thereby decreasing the resources required 
to conduct effectiveness evaluations. 
Experiments showed QA accuracy and speed 
increased with higher IE performance, and that 
the database blend percentage was a good proxy 
for ACE value scores.  We emphasize that the 
study was not to show that IE supports QA bet-
ter than other technologies, rather to isolate util-
ity gains due to IE performance improvements. 
QA performance was plotted against human-
machine IE blend and, for example, 70% QA 
performance was achieved with a database blend 
between 41% and 46% machine extraction.  This 
corresponded to entity and relationship value 
scores of roughly 74 and 47 respectively. 
The logistic dose-response model provided a 
good fit and allowed for computation of confi-
dence bounds for the IE associated with a par-
ticular level of performance. The constraints 
imposed by AnswerPad and FactBrowser en-
sured that world knowledge was neutralized, and 
the repeated-measures design (using participants 
as their own controls across multiple levels of 
database quality) excluded inter-participant vari-
ability from experimental error, increasing the 
ability to detect differences with relatively small 
sample sizes.
