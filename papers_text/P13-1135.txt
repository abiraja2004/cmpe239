Abstract
Parallel text is the fuel that drives modern
machine translation systems. The Web is a
comprehensive source of preexisting par-
allel text, but crawling the entire web is
impossible for all but the largest compa-
nies. We bring web-scale parallel text to
the masses by mining the Common Crawl,
a public Web crawl hosted on Amazon?s
Elastic Cloud. Starting from nothing more
than a set of common two-letter language
codes, our open-source extension of the
STRAND algorithm mined 32 terabytes of
the crawl in just under a day, at a cost of
about $500. Our large-scale experiment
uncovers large amounts of parallel text in
dozens of language pairs across a variety
of domains and genres, some previously
unavailable in curated datasets. Even with
minimal cleaning and filtering, the result-
ing data boosts translation performance
across the board for five different language
pairs in the news domain, and on open do-
main test sets we see improvements of up
to 5 BLEU. We make our code and data
available for other researchers seeking to
mine this rich new data resource.1
1 Introduction
A key bottleneck in porting statistical machine
translation (SMT) technology to new languages
and domains is the lack of readily available paral-
lel corpora beyond curated datasets. For a handful
of language pairs, large amounts of parallel data
?This research was conducted while Chris Callison-
Burch was at Johns Hopkins University.

are readily available, ordering in the hundreds of
millions of words for Chinese-English and Arabic-
English, and in tens of millions of words for many
European languages (Koehn, 2005). In each case,
much of this data consists of government and news
text. However, for most language pairs and do-
mains there is little to no curated parallel data
available. Hence discovery of parallel data is an
important first step for translation between most
of the world?s languages.
The Web is an important source of parallel
text. Many websites are available in multiple
languages, and unlike other potential sources?
such as multilingual news feeds (Munteanu and
Marcu, 2005) or Wikipedia (Smith et al, 2010)?
it is common to find document pairs that are di-
rect translations of one another. This natural par-
allelism simplifies the mining task, since few re-
sources or existing corpora are needed at the outset
to bootstrap the extraction process.
Parallel text mining from the Web was origi-
nally explored by individuals or small groups of
academic researchers using search engines (Nie
et al, 1999; Chen and Nie, 2000; Resnik, 1999;
Resnik and Smith, 2003). However, anything
more sophisticated generally requires direct access
to web-crawled documents themselves along with
the computing power to process them. For most
researchers, this is prohibitively expensive. As a
consequence, web-mined parallel text has become
the exclusive purview of large companies with the
computational resources to crawl, store, and pro-
cess the entire Web.
To put web-mined parallel text back in the
hands of individual researchers, we mine parallel
text from the Common Crawl, a regularly updated
81-terabyte snapshot of the public internet hosted
1374
on Amazon?s Elastic Cloud (EC2) service.2 Us-
ing the Common Crawl completely removes the
bottleneck of web crawling, and makes it possi-
ble to run algorithms on a substantial portion of
the web at very low cost. Starting from nothing
other than a set of language codes, our extension
of the STRAND algorithm (Resnik and Smith,
2003) identifies potentially parallel documents us-
ing cues from URLs and document content (?2).
We conduct an extensive empirical exploration of
the web-mined data, demonstrating coverage in
a wide variety of languages and domains (?3).
Even without extensive pre-processing, the data
improves translation performance on strong base-
line news translation systems in five different lan-
guage pairs (?4). On general domain and speech
translation tasks where test conditions substan-
tially differ from standard government and news
training text, web-mined training data improves
performance substantially, resulting in improve-
ments of up to 1.5 BLEU on standard test sets, and
5 BLEU on test sets outside of the news domain.
2 Mining the Common Crawl
The Common Crawl corpus is hosted on Ama-
zon?s Simple Storage Service (S3). It can be
downloaded to a local cluster, but the transfer cost
is prohibitive at roughly 10 cents per gigabyte,
making the total over $8000 for the full dataset.3
However, it is unnecessary to obtain a copy of the
data since it can be accessed freely from Amazon?s
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or Elastic MapRe-
duce (EMR) services. In our pipeline, we per-
form the first step of identifying candidate docu-
ment pairs using Amazon EMR, download the re-
sulting document pairs, and perform the remain-
ing steps on our local cluster. We chose EMR be-
cause our candidate matching strategy fit naturally
into the Map-Reduce framework (Dean and Ghe-
mawat, 2004).
Our system is based on the STRAND algorithm
(Resnik and Smith, 2003):
1. Candidate pair selection: Retrieve candidate
document pairs from the CommonCrawl cor-
pus.
2. Structural Filtering:
(a) Convert the HTML of each document
2commoncrawl.org
3http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
into a sequence of start tags, end tags,
and text chunks.
(b) Align the linearized HTML of candidate
document pairs.
(c) Decide whether to accept or reject each
pair based on features of the alignment.
3. Segmentation: For each text chunk, perform
sentence and word segmentation.
4. Sentence Alignment: For each aligned pair of
text chunks, perform the sentence alignment
method of Gale and Church (1993).
5. Sentence Filtering: Remove sentences that
appear to be boilerplate.
Candidate Pair Selection We adopt a strategy
similar to that of Resnik and Smith (2003) for find-
ing candidate parallel documents, adapted to the
parallel architecture of Map-Reduce.
The mapper operates on each website entry in
the CommonCrawl data. It scans the URL string
for some indicator of its language. Specifically,
we check for:
1. Two/three letter language codes (ISO-639).
2. Language names in English and in the lan-
guage of origin.
If either is present in a URL and surrounded by
non-alphanumeric characters, the URL is identi-
fied as a potential match and the mapper outputs
a key value pair in which the key is the original
URL with the matching string replaced by *, and
the value is the original URL, language name, and
full HTML of the page. For example, if we en-
counter the URL www.website.com/fr/, we
output the following.
? Key: www.website.com/*/
? Value: www.website.com/fr/, French,
(full website entry)
The reducer then receives all websites mapped
to the same ?language independent? URL. If two
or more websites are associated with the same key,
the reducer will output all associated values, as
long as they are not in the same language, as de-
termined by the language identifier in the URL.
This URL-based matching is a simple and in-
expensive solution to the problem of finding can-
didate document pairs. The mapper will discard
1375
most, and neither the mapper nor the reducer do
anything with the HTML of the documents aside
from reading and writing them. This approach is
very simple and likely misses many good potential
candidates, but has the advantage that it requires
no information other than a set of language codes,
and runs in time roughly linear in the size of the
dataset.
Structural Filtering A major component of the
STRAND system is the alignment of HTML docu-
ments. This alignment is used to determine which
document pairs are actually parallel, and if they
are, to align pairs of text blocks within the docu-
ments.
The first step of structural filtering is to lin-
earize the HTML. This means converting its DOM
tree into a sequence of start tags, end tags, and
chunks of text. Some tags (those usually found
within text, such as ?font? and ?a?) are ignored
during this step. Next, the tag/chunk sequences
are aligned using dynamic programming. The ob-
jective of the alignment is to maximize the number
of matching items.
Given this alignment, Resnik and Smith (2003)
define a small set of features which indicate the
alignment quality. They annotated a set of docu-
ment pairs as parallel or non-parallel, and trained
a classifier on this data. We also annotated 101
Spanish-English document pairs in this way and
trained a maximum entropy classifier. However,
even when using the best performing subset of fea-
tures, the classifier only performed as well as a
naive classifier which labeled every document pair
as parallel, in both accuracy and F1. For this rea-
son, we excluded the classifier from our pipeline.
The strong performance of the naive baseline was
likely due to the unbalanced nature of the anno-
tated data? 80% of the document pairs that we
annotated were parallel.
Segmentation The text chunks from the previ-
ous step may contain several sentences, so before
the sentence alignment step we must perform sen-
tence segmentation. We use the Punkt sentence
splitter from NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) to
perform both sentence and word segmentation on
each text chunk.
Sentence Alignment For each aligned text
chunk pair, we perform sentence alignment using
the algorithm of Gale and Church (1993).
Sentence Filtering Since we do not perform any
boilerplate removal in earlier steps, there are many
sentence pairs produced by the pipeline which
contain menu items or other bits of text which are
not useful to an SMT system. We avoid perform-
ing any complex boilerplate removal and only re-
move segment pairs where either the source and
target text are identical, or where the source or
target segments appear more than once in the ex-
tracted corpus.
3 Analysis of the Common Crawl Data
We ran our algorithm on the 2009-2010 version
of the crawl, consisting of 32.3 terabytes of data.
Since the full dataset is hosted on EC2, the only
cost to us is CPU time charged by Amazon, which
came to a total of about $400, and data stor-
age/transfer costs for our output, which came to
roughly $100. For practical reasons we split the
run into seven subsets, on which the full algo-
rithm was run independently. This is different
from running a single Map-Reduce job over the
entire dataset, since websites in different subsets
of the data cannot be matched. However, since
the data is stored as it is crawled, it is likely that
matching websites will be found in the same split
of the data. Table 1 shows the amount of raw par-
allel data obtained for a large selection of language
pairs.
As far as we know, ours is the first system built
to mine parallel text from the Common Crawl.
Since the resource is new, we wanted to under-
stand the quantity, quality, and type of data that
we are likely to obtain from it. To this end, we
conducted a number of experiments to measure
these features. Since our mining heuristics are
very simple, these results can be construed as a
lower bound on what is actually possible.
3.1 Recall Estimates
Our first question is about recall: of all the pos-
sible parallel text that is actually available on the
Web, how much does our algorithm actually find
in the Common Crawl? Although this question
is difficult to answer precisely, we can estimate
an answer by comparing our mined URLs against
a large collection of previously mined URLs that
were found using targeted techniques: those in the
French-English Gigaword corpus (Callison-Burch
et al, 2011).
We found that 45% of the URL pairs would

have been discovered by our heuristics, though we
actually only find 3.6% of these URLs in our out-
put.4 If we had included ?f? and ?e? as identi-
fiers for French and English respectively, coverage
of the URL pairs would increase to 74%. How-
ever, we chose not to include single letter identi-
fiers in our experiments due to the high number of
false positives they generated in preliminary ex-
periments.
3.2 Precision Estimates
Since our algorithms rely on cues that are mostly
external to the contents of the extracted data
and have no knowledge of actual languages, we
wanted to evaluate the precision of our algorithm:
how much of the mined data actually consists of
parallel sentences?
To measure this, we conducted a manual anal-
ysis of 200 randomly selected sentence pairs for
each of three language pairs. The texts are het-
erogeneous, covering several topical domains like
tourism, advertising, technical specifications, fi-
nances, e-commerce and medicine. For German-
English, 78% of the extracted data represent per-
fect translations, 4% are paraphrases of each other
(convey a similar meaning, but cannot be used
for SMT training) and 18% represent misalign-
ments. Furthermore, 22% of the true positives
are potentially machine translations (judging by
the quality), whereas in 13% of the cases one of
the sentences contains additional content not ex-

pressed in the other. As for the false positives,
13.5% of them have either the source or target
sentence in the wrong language, and the remain-
ing ones representing failures in the alignment
process. Across three languages, our inspection
revealed that around 80% of randomly sampled
data appeared to contain good translations (Table
2). Although this analysis suggests that language
identification and SMT output detection (Venu-
gopal et al, 2011) may be useful additions to the
pipeline, we regard this as reasonably high preci-
sion for our simple algorithm.

French 81%

Table 2: Manual evaluation of precision (by sen-
tence pair) on the extracted parallel data for Span-
ish, French, and German (paired with English).
In addition to the manual evaluation of preci-
sion, we applied language identification to our
extracted parallel data for several additional lan-
guages. We used the ?langid.py? tool (Lui and
Baldwin, 2012) at the segment level, and report the
percentage of sentence pairs where both sentences
were recognized as the correct language. Table 3
shows our results. Comparing against our man-
ual evaluation from Table 2, it appears that many
sentence pairs are being incorrectly judged as non-
parallel. This is likely because language identifi-
cation tends to perform poorly on short segments.

3.3 Domain Name and Topic Analysis
Although the above measures tell us something
about how well our algorithms perform in aggre-
gate for specific language pairs, we also wondered
about the actual contents of the data. A major
difficulty in applying SMT even on languages for
which we have significant quantities of parallel
text is that most of that parallel text is in the news
and government domains. When applied to other
genres, such systems are notoriously brittle. What
kind of genres are represented in the Common
Crawl data?
We first looked at the domain names which con-
tributed the most data. Table 4 gives the top five
domains by the number of tokens. The top two do-
main names are related to travel, and they account
for about 10% of the total data.
We also applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA; Blei et al, 2003) to learn a distribution over
latent topics in the extracted data, as this is a pop-
ular exploratory data analysis method. In LDA
a topic is a unigram distribution over words, and
each document is modeled as a distribution over
topics. To create a set of documents from the ex-
tracted CommonCrawl data, we took the English
side of the extracted parallel segments for each
URL in the Spanish-English portion of the data.
This gave us a total of 444, 022 documents. In
our first experiment, we used the MALLET toolkit
(McCallum, 2002) to generate 20 topics, which
are shown in Table 5.
Some of the topics that LDA finds cor-
respond closely with specific domains,
such as topics 1 (blingee.com) and 2
(opensubtitles.org). Several of the topics
correspond to the travel domain. Foreign stop
words appear in a few of the topics. Since our sys-
tem does not include any language identification,
this is not surprising.5 However it does suggest an
avenue for possible improvement.
In our second LDA experiment, we compared
our extracted CommonCrawl data with Europarl.
We created a set of documents from both Com-
monCrawl and Europarl, and again used MAL-
LET to generate 100 topics for this data.6 We then
labeled each document by its most likely topic (as
determined by that topic?s mixture weights), and
counted the number of documents from Europarl
and CommonCrawl for which each topic was most
prominent. While this is very rough, it gives some
idea of where each topic is coming from. Table 6
shows a sample of these topics.
In addition to exploring topics in the datasets,
we also performed additional intrinsic evaluation
at the domain level, choosing top domains for
three language pairs. We specifically classified
sentence pairs as useful or boilerplate (Table 7).
Among our observations, we find that commer-
cial websites tend to contain less boilerplate ma-
terial than encyclopedic websites, and that the ra-
tios tend to be similar across languages in the same
domain.

4 Machine Translation Experiments
For our SMT experiments, we use the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007). In these experiments,
a baseline system is trained on an existing parallel
corpus, and the experimental system is trained on
the baseline corpus plus the mined parallel data.
In all experiments we include the target side of the
mined parallel data in the language model, in order
to distinguish whether results are due to influences
from parallel or monolingual data.
5We used MALLET?s stop word removal, but that is only
for English.
6Documents were created from Europarl by taking
?SPEAKER? tags as document boundaries, giving us
208,431 documents total.

4.1 News Domain Translation
Our first set of experiments are based on systems
built for the 2012 Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (WMT) (Callison-Burch et al,
2012) using all available parallel and monolingual
data for that task, aside from the French-English
Gigaword. In these experiments, we use 5-gram
language models when the target language is En-
glish or German, and 4-gram language models for
French and Spanish. We tune model weights using
minimum error rate training (MERT; Och, 2003)
on the WMT 2008 test data. The results are given
in Table 8. For all language pairs and both test
sets (WMT 2011 and WMT 2012), we show an
improvement of around 0.5 BLEU.
We also included the French-English Gigaword
in separate experiments given in Table 9, and Table
10 compares the sizes of the datasets used. These
results show that even on top of a different, larger
parallel corpus mined from the web, adding Com-
monCrawl data still yields an improvement.
4.2 Open Domain Translation
A substantial appeal of web-mined parallel data
is that it might be suitable to translation of do-
mains other than news, and our topic modeling
analysis (?3.3) suggested that this might indeed be
the case. We therefore performed an additional
set of experiments for Spanish-English, but we
include test sets from outside the news domain.

fect of such data compares with the effect of web-
mined data. The baseline system was trained using
only the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) as par-
allel data, and all experiments use the same lan-
guage model trained on the target sides of Eu-
roparl, the English side of all linked Spanish-
English Wikipedia articles, and the English side
of the mined CommonCrawl data. We use a 5-
gram language model and tune using MERT (Och,

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain meaning-
ful results on some open domain test sets such as
the Wikipedia dataset used by Smith et al (2010).
Wikipedia copied across the public internet, and
we did not have a simple way to filter such data
from our mined datasets.
We therefore considered two tests that were
less likely to be problematic. The Tatoeba cor-
pus (Tiedemann, 2009) is a collection of example
sentences translated into many languages by vol-
unteers. The front page of tatoeba.org was
discovered by our URL matching heuristics, but
we excluded any sentence pairs that were found in
the CommonCrawl data from this test set.

The second dataset is a set of crowdsourced
translation of Spanish speech transcriptions from
the Spanish Fisher corpus.7 As part of a re-
search effort on cross-lingual speech applications,
we obtained English translations of the data using
Amazon Mechanical Turk, following a protocol
similar to one described by Zaidan and Callison-
Burch (2011): we provided clear instructions,
employed several quality control measures, and
obtained redundant translations of the complete
dataset (Lopez et al, 2013). The advantage of
this data for our open domain translation test is
twofold. First, the Fisher dataset consists of con-
versations in various Spanish dialects on a wide
variety of prompted topics. Second, because we
obtained the translations ourselves, we could be
absolutely assured that they did not appear in some
form anywhere on the Web, making it an ideal
blind test.

We used 1000 sentences from each of the
Tatoeba and Fisher datasets as test. For com-
parison, we also test on the WMT 2010 test
set (Callison-Burch et al, 2010). Following
Munteanu and Marcu (2005), we show the n-gram
coverage of each corpus (percentage of n-grams
from the test corpus which are also found in the
training corpora) in Table 11. Table 12 gives
end-to-end results, which show a strong improve-
ment on the WMT test set (1.5 BLEU), and larger

5 Discussion
Web-mined parallel texts have been an exclusive
resource of large companies for several years.
However, when web-mined parallel text is avail-
able to everyone at little or no cost, there will
be much greater potential for groundbreaking re-
search to come from all corners. With the advent
of public services such as Amazon Web Services
and the Common Crawl, this may soon be a re-
ality. As we have shown, it is possible to obtain
parallel text for many language pairs in a variety
of domains very cheaply and quickly, and in suf-
ficient quantity and quality to improve statistical
machine translation systems. However, our effort
has merely scratched the surface of what is pos-
sible with this resource. We will make our code
and data available so that others can build on these
results.
Because our system is so simple, we believe that
our results represent lower bounds on the gains
that should be expected in performance of systems
previously trained only on curated datasets. There
are many possible means through which the sys-
tem could be improved, including more sophisti-
cated techniques for identifying matching URLs,
better alignment, better language identification,
better filtering of data, and better exploitation of
resulting cross-domain datasets. Many of the com-
ponents of our pipeline were basic, leaving consid-
erable room for improvement. For example, the
URL matching strategy could easily be improved
for a given language pair by spending a little time
crafting regular expressions tailored to some ma-
jor websites. Callison-Burch et al (2011) gathered
almost 1 trillion tokens of French-English parallel
data this way. Another strategy for mining parallel
webpage pairs is to scan the HTML for links to the
same page in another language (Nie et al, 1999).
Other, more sophisticated techniques may also
be possible. Uszkoreit et al (2010), for ex-
ample, translated all non-English webpages into
English using an existing translation system and
used near-duplicate detection methods to find can-
didate parallel document pairs. Ture and Lin
(2012) had a similar approach for finding paral-
lel Wikipedia documents by using near-duplicate
detection, though they did not need to apply a full
translation system to all non-English documents.

Instead, they represented documents in bag-of-
words vector space, and projected non-English
document vectors into the English vector space us-
ing the translation probabilities of a word align-
ment model. By comparison, one appeal of our
simple approach is that it requires only a table
of language codes. However, with this system
in place, we could obtain enough parallel data to
bootstrap these more sophisticated approaches.
It is also compelling to consider ways in which
web-mined data obtained from scratch could be
used to bootstrap other mining approaches. For
example, Smith et al (2010) mine parallel sen-
tences from comparable documents in Wikipedia,
demonstrating substantial gains on open domain
translation. However, their approach required seed
parallel data to learn models used in a classifier.
We imagine a two-step process, first obtaining par-
allel data from the web, followed by comparable
data from sources such as Wikipedia using mod-
els bootstrapped from the web-mined data. Such a
process could be used to build translation systems
for new language pairs in a very short period of
time, hence fulfilling one of the original promises
of SMT.
