1. An ATN parser  fo r  I ta l ian  has  been deve loped and  
tes ted  in  a ser ies  o f  exper iments  on complex  sentences  taken  
f rom nar ra t ive  texts  (1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ) .  The const ruct ion  o f  a complex  
graemmz as  we l l  as  the  resu l t s  o f  our  exper iments  showed some 
l imi ts  and inadequac ies  o f  Woods" ATN as i t  s tands  (11) ,  
espec ia l l y  when used  to  parse  I ta l ian ,  a re la t ive ly  f ree -  
o rder  language w i th  a we l l  deve loped morpho log ica l  sys tem.  
1 .1 .  "Parameter -pass ing"  ac t ions  such  as  SENDR and 
LIFTR have  been o f ten  Judged "d i r ty"  operat ions  under  a fo rm-  
a l  v iew-po in t .  Moreover  i t  i s  a lmost  imposs ib le  to  keep  the  
cont ro l  o f  the  c ross - leve l  pa~sed in fo rmat ion ,  un less  the  
~umber o f  reg is ters  i s  inc reased .  Such an  increase  i s  o ther -  
w ise  unmot ivated .  Th is  d i f f i cu l ty  i s  more ev ident  in  I ta l ian  
relative clauses such as: 
L" uomo la  cu i  c rude l ta"  tu t t i  conose iamo 
The man ( the)  whose c rue l ty  everyone  knows 
L" uomo la  c rude l ta"  de l  qua le  tu t t i  conosc ismo 
The man the  c rue l ty  o f  whom everyone  knows 
L ? uomo de l  des ider io  d i  vendet ta  de l  qua le  t i  he par la to  
The man about  the  des i re  fo r  revenge o f  whom I spoke to  you 
in  wh ich  a very  heavy  use  o f  such  act ions ,  as  we l l  as  o f  
f lags ,  i s  requ i red .  These  phenomena,  together  w i th  the  r i ch -  
ness  o f  morpho log ica l  in f lex ion ,  inc rease  the  necess i ty  fo r  
morpho log ica l  and morpho-syntact i c  shor t ,  l ong-d is tance  and 
cross-level tests.

1.2 ,  Another problem i s  proposed by the s t ruc tura l  ambi- 
8~i ty  of  sequences of  PP 's ,  fo r  which both the "embedding" and 
the "same- leve l "  hypotheses are presented!  a sentence  wi th  ) 
PP's has 5 parses accordlng to the schema 
(PPI (PP2 (PP3))), (PPI (PF2)(PP3)), (PFI (PI~) PP3),(PP1 
P~ (PP3)), (PP1 P~ PP3) 
An attempt to limit th~s explosion was made by adding oertaln. 
functional labels depending upon the verb frame. This experim- 
ent showed that  a t tent ion  should be focussed on deve lop ing  an 
adequate system of  funct iona l  tes ts .  
1 .3 .  A s ta t i s t i ca l l y  based,  dynsmic heur i s t i c  mechanism 
has been put to  work in  the t raversa l  of  the network.  Those 
paths which have been more f requent ly  t raversed  in  prev ious  
parsed f rasments  of  a g iven text  are at tempted f i r s t ,  dur ing  
the ana lys i s  of  the CUZTent sentence  (6 ) .  
In  th i s  way, the concept of  performance based syntact i c  
expectat ion  has been in t roduced  and tes ted .  I t  appeared that  
ATN i s  very  su i ted  to the  in t roduct ion  of  heur i s t i c  techn iques  
and a lso  that  these  techn iques  should inc lude  a schedu l ing  
procedure based on arc  types  (10) .  
2.  A rev is ion  of  the l ingu is t i c  formal ism as we l l  as of  
the  pars ing  a lSor i thm i s  now in  p rogress ,  and should take a l l  
these  cons iderat ions  in to  account .  Furthermore,  those  l insu is t -  
i o  phenomena re la ted  to conversat ion  such as anaphora and the 
ana lys i s  o f  par t ia l  and par t ia l l y  cor rec t  input  must be taken 
in to  account in  the  des i s~ ing  of  the formal ism and the ATN 
act ions  and forms,  not only fo r  app l i ca t ive  purposes ,  but 
above a l l  in  o rder  to en la rge  the  range of  phenomena to be 
inc luded  in  a ~ammar .  
2 .1 .  The parser  re l ies  both on s t ruc tura l  and funct iona l  
Information (7), i,e. a limited collection of surface struct- 
ures and funct iona l  labe ls .  A se t  of  f i xed  (cont ro l )  pat tsz~s  
might a l so  be inc luded  in  th i s  s ta t i c  syntact i c  knowledge 
- 102  - 
(B, 9)?  The output  representat ion ,  however, i s  in  terms of 
funct iona l  labe ls ?  The u t i l i za t ion  of these three  data  types 
w i l l  be fu l l y  d i scussed .  
2 .2 .  I t  i s  not our in tent ion  to substant ia l l y  modify 
the genera l  s t ruc ture  of  the a lgor i thm?  S tor ing  and re t r iev -  
ing  w i l l  be mod i f ied ,  in  accordance wi th  our observat ions  in  
1 .1.  A s ing le  reg is te r  externa l  to the leve ls  of  computat ion 
w i l l  be progress ive ly  se t  to the resu l t s  of  the ana lys i s  
dur ing pars ing .  Access to p rec i se  locat ion  of th i s  s t ruc ture  
is guaranteed by the functional labels. Traditional ATN 
registers can be locally used for special purposes. A detail- 
ed description of our whole mechanism including examples will 
be given? 
Already assigned functional labels cannot be chanEed! 
left concatenation of them has been preferred (8). A mechanism 
has also been provided to move pointers from constituents to 
gape or anaphorical pronouns (inside the sentence borders) (5). 
This is an attempt to treat by a uniform action or sequence 
of actions equ/-NP deletion, gapplng, coordination. 
2.3. Some local procedures connected with the lexicon 
have been added to these mechanisms. These procedures include 
the transmission of feature's to higher level nodes in the 
structure, the proceduralisation of idiosyncrasies of single 
leKical entries and "paraphrase'. The latter is expected to 
reduce nominalizatlon to the corresponding verb with its 
frame components and to account for linguistic units which 
have identical distribution and syntactic behavlour. 
2.4? The present list of "linguistically* motivated 
processes is open-ended, as we are now trying to identify 
others, which can be considered to be linguistic (procedural) 
?um/versals "?
