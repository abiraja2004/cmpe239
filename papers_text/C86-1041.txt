Abstract 
This paper gives a formal theory of presupposition using 
situation semantics developed by Barwise and Perry, We will 
slightly modify Barwise and Perry's original theory of situation 
semantics so that we can deal with non-monotonic reasonings 
which are very important for the formalization of presupposi- 
tion in natural language. This aspect is closely related to the 
formalization of incomplete knowledge in art i f ic ia l  intelligence, 
1. Introduction 
In constructing a natural language understanding system 
we face,serious problems in syntax, semantics and pragmatlcs, 
From a computational point of view, pragmatics especially 
poses the greatest problem. At present there exists no 
appropriate theory of pragmatics for natural language. A few 
approaches proposed so far seem to o f fer  linguistic or compu- 
tational diff icult ies in their foundation, for they never give 
a computational mechanism for pragmatics in an ef fect ive way. 
In understaqding the meaning of a natural language we use 
both the knowledge for the language and the so-called 
world know~ Most of the inferences used in natural 
language can be dependent upon the latter. Many researchers, 
however, have ignored in their formalism this aspect of natural 
language reasonings. 
We believe that a desirable formalism must include two 
important devices: f i rst ly  a representation of world knowledge: 
secondly, an inference system involved in the world knowledge. 
The forme," has already been realized in many A\] systems, while 
the latter  cannot be found in most systems. As for the latter," 
although there are such non-classical systems as non-monotonic 
logics and fuzzy logic, a more suitable inference system for 
incomplete knowledge is definitely in need. And linguistic 
observations have shown that traditional model-theoretic 
formalisms are inadequate in this respect. 
Presupposition is essential In understanding natural 
language. The possibility of suspending presuppositions of a 
sentence shows that presupposition has lobe  undarstobd as  
an inference in an incompletely perceived world. Hence con- 
structing a theory of natural language reasonings as presup. 
position calls for one" Incorporating non-monotonic reasonings, 
From such considerations we choose Situation Semantics 
(henceforth SS) developed by Barwise and Perry (1983) as a 
basis of our theory. In SS the meaning of a sentence is repre- 
sented as a relation between the situations in which the 
sentence is uttered and the situations described by such 
utterances. We take presuppositions to be information about 
the described situations consistently restricted by the uttered 
situations. 
In section Z we review presupposition briefly. The subsequent 
sections will provide a theoretical foundation for it on the 
basis of 5S. 
2, Presupposition 
Before formalizing pr(~supposition, we shah consider the 
important question: "what is a presupposition?" The answer to 
this question Is the kev to the construction of a formal theory 
of presupposition. 
We find in the literature- several definitions of presup- 
position. For example, many philosophers and linguists assume 
the definition generally represented as follows: 
(Def 1) A presupposes 8 i f f  
(i) A entails B 
00 -A entails B 
This definition leads the undesired conclusion that B Is a 
+.autology. Clearly an improved definl'tion is in order. 
Karttunen (1973) gives the following as an alternative: 
(IDef 2) A ~t ica l ly  presupposesB relative tq a set of 
assumed facts C i f f  it is riot acceptable to utter A In the 
context C unless C entails B, 
This definition says that a presupposition is an entailment 
of the sentence in a context. Regretablv, nowever, there are 
no formal definitions for such terms as 'entails', ' relative to', 
174 
'context, in the above definition, 
Gazdar (1979),'on the other hand, gives the following 
definition. 
(Def 3) praBmatic presupposition is entailed bv the 
context in favour of the weaker requirement hat they be 
consistent with the context. 
There he further gives the fallowing informal definitions 
of essential terms in the above definit ion @s follows, 
(Def 3.1) A sentence A is entailed bv a set of sentence B 
Just in case A is true in every possible world in which all 
members of B are true. 
(Def 3.2) A sentence A is consistent with a set of 
sentences 8 just in case A is true tn some possible world 
in which all members of B are true. 
Thus Gazdar's definition crucia}lv depends on the notion of 
consistency. 
Although llis definition seems to be more plausible than the 
other definitions based en entailments, as it enables us to 
accommodate the so-called projection prob!em at ease, yet It 
is not' entirely free from shortcomings, 
HIS theory is based on possible-world semantics, which is 
not quite adequate as a natural language semantics. The 
Inappropriateness of such a theory is discussed in BarwJse and 
Perry (1983), Akama (1986) in detail. From a computational point 
of view, especially many of its deficiencies can be stated, To 
say the least possible-world semantics seems to fail to deal 
with partial information in an ef fect ive way, And in theories 
in this tradition only restr icted statements can be derived 
from its model that is, accessibility relations af fect  logical 
structures in the model. Moreover although unrealistic 
objects may be possible in a model, they are not suitable for  
a computational paradigm. 
In computer science Mercer and Relter (1982) formulated 
presupposition, more or less In Gazdar's spirit, as an inference 
generated from a pragmatic rule, namely, default rule. Since 
their formalism ts based on f i rst -order theory, similar short- 
comings as in the case of passible-world semantics can be 
pointed cut. It is, however, interesting to notice its f lexlbi i i ty 
in the application to knowledge representation. 
To overcome the above mentioned diff icult ies in traditional 
theories, we introduces SS as an underlying theory for  presup- 
position below, 
3. Formal Theory of Presupposition 
We are concerned in this section with formalizing the 
notion of presupposition within the framework of SS. 
Our theory is a l i t t le  d i f ferent  than the version presented 
In Barwise and P(~rrv (1983) or Barwise (1985), for we Introduce 
some modifications in the theory so that we can accomodate 
presupposition in natural language, 
More specifically, our formalism assumes a non-monotonic 
relation between events called plausibility orderin9, as opposed 
to the monotonic 'persistence' relation assumed in Barwise and 
Perry (198\]). As a consequence, our theory is not only capable 
of treating presupposition In an elegant way, but is able to 
deal with default and autoepistemic reasonings as well. 
3,1 Outline of Situation Semantics 
|n this section we review brief ly some basic points of SS. 
Here we mainly follow the formalism recently introduced in 
Barwise (1984, 1985) rather than the original one in Barwise and 
Perry (1983) since it  is simpler and more comprehensive. 
The most attract ive idea of SS is the shift of attention 
from 'truth conditions to 'information conditions'. $5 can be 
said to be an attempt at explicating the nature of language 
focussing on the following two aspects: 
(1) under what conditions a sentence can be used to 
convey information. 
(2) what information the sentence conveys under those 
conditions. 
A situation S can contain information in v i r tue of  some 
constraint  the holds between types of  situations. We denote 
types of  situa.tions as S, S' .... We wr i te  s:S If s i tuat ion s is 
S, A type of s i tuat ion S is realized i f  there is a real 
s i tuat ion s such that, s:S, There are three categories of  
objects across situations: namely, individua.~ denoted as: a, 
b . . . .  ; relations: r, s . . . .  : and Iocat~ L 1 . . . .  Corresponding 
to each category, there are purely abstract ,  sort  or dummy. 
ent i t ies  called indeterminates that  stand proxy for  genuine 
objects. We represent indeterminates by So, $b . . . .  ; $r. $r' . . . .  ; 
$\], $1' . . . .  Anehorin 9 is a funct ion that  assigns individuals, 
relations, and locations to the indeterminates. 
For example, the fol lowing is a type of s i tuat ion where 
a is in re lat ion R to be b: " 
S - ($s\]ln $s: at $1: R. a, b: 1\] 
where R, a, and b denote some respect ively  speci f ic  re lat ion 
and individual, and $s and $1 are indeteminates.  
Given an anchor that  assign 1' to $1, the fol lowing can be 
a real s i tuat ion where a and b are in the same re lat ion R: 
in s: at \]' : R, a,  b; 1. 
A Constraint is a re lat ion holding between types of situa- 
tion, S -> ~r, we read i t  as S involves S'. In tu i t ive ly  this means 
that  i f  S is realized, that  is, there is a real s i tuat ion s:S, 
then there is a real s i tuat ion s' such that  s':S'. 
Given any constra int  and any anchor f fo r  some or all  of 
the parameters in S, the result  of  replacing the parameters by 
appropr iate values will give rise te an actual constraint .  
To wit, if 
S~ S' 
is actual, then so is 
S(f )  ? S ' ( f ) .  
We call the la t te r  an instance of  the former, t4ere we can 
extend the involves re lat ion to a three-place re lat ion as 
S # S'/B 
whhere B is the backcjround conditions on the s i tuat ions in 
which const ra in (between S and S' holds. 
Let R be n* l -p lace re lat ion taking n+l objects al  . . . . .  an*l. 
Suppose parameter - f ree type 
S - \ [$s l in  $s: R, al . . . . .  an, Sam1; i\] (l - 0 or  1) 
is realized. \ ] f  $an*l Js an environment constant, that  is, it Is 
f ixed in some way, then i t  only takes n objects and a t ruth  
value to determine the same proposit ion. 
In the above mentioned remark of  involves relat ion, B 
corresponds to an environment constant. Parametric Informa- 
t ion is re lat ive to some assignment to parameters in a type of  
s ituation. 
Barwise (19B~) uses the two dist inct  terms fo r  'meaning', 
namely, s i tuat ion meaning and s i tuat ion- type meanin 9, The 
former is used fo r  talk ing about the meaning of  part icu lar  
situation, while ti le la t te r  Is fo r  the meaning of  a certa in  tvPe 
of  s ituation. We can ident l fv  s i tuat ion meaning with informa- 
tion, so a part icu lar  state of af fa i r s  has a s i tuat ion meaning. 
And understanding 4he s i tuat ion meaning of  par t icu lar  mental 
state requires an understanding of  the s i tuat ion- type meaning 
of that  type of  state, as i t  normally functions in the external  
l i fe  of  the agent, Here I f  we take into account a congnit ive 
state o f  the agent we need two paral lel  sets of  constraints,  
one on some act iv i ty  A and the other  on cognit ive ac t iv i ty  
about A. '~, 
More formally, let  #S, #S' . . . .  be types of  s i tuat ion of  the 
mental state for a f ixed agent. Also tile agent is able to 
construct  #0: #S ~ #S', Usually we assume the fol lowing 
diagram of  constraints between mental s i tuat ions and situations, 
that is, 
S # S' 
t 
#S ~ #S' 
Here we assume there exists a homomorphJsm F from a 
col lect ion of  types of  s i tuat ion to a col lect ion of corre-  
sponding types of  s i tuat ion of mental states, namely there is 
an F such that  F(s) - flS, This generates that  an agent can 
in terpret  real s i tuat ions in various ways. Thus involve re lat ion 
relat ion between real s ituations and mental si%uations can be 
regarded as an inverse of F, namelv F-'(#S) - S. According to 
the above mentioned def init ions we can eostruct  some types of  
s i tuat ion of  mental state in the e f fec t ive  way, I f  there is no 
agent, as is the case in a knowledge system, #S is considered 
as se l f - re ferent ia l  statement on fie. We think its foundations 
are more or less cotrovers ia l ,  
\]n SS an inference is an ac t iv i ty  that attempts to use facts  
about the world to ext rac t  addit ional information, information 
implicit in the facts,  A sound inference then is the appropr iate 
chain of  information. 
3,2. Formalism of  Modified SS 
There are two main features to be taken into account when 
providing an appropr iate def in i t ion for  presupposition in 
natural language, One thing is to accommodate a lack of  
complete information. The other  thing is to accommodate the 
agent's bel ief  context,  fhe former is called 'defaul t '  and the 
la t te r  autoepistemic' respect ively.  Although they appear to 
be independent of  each other  in thei r  involvement in presup- 
position, our formalism is capable of dealing with both of  them. 
Our modif ication of  SS is mainly concerned with revising 
the involves re lat ion between situations. As we said at the 
outset of  this chapter, instead of  the part ia l  ordering of  
information, namely, ~ .nccA~e assumed in the original 
version of Barwise and Perry (1983), we shah introduce the 
plausibi l i ty ordering, -(, sat is fy ing the fol lowing conditions: 
(1) A -{ B implies Ac_B (=_ is an ordinary monotonic relation), 
(Z) A ~ A ( re f lex iv i ty) ,  
(3) A -( B and B -( C impllies A -C C ( t rans i t iv i tv) ,  
Although the exact  nature of' the plausibi l i ty ordering is rather  
vague, its in tu i t ive  meaning is that  any information, whether 
cor rec t  or incor rect  in the actual,  is of  use in the model for  
SS. 
For instance, we presuppose b y__defau\]t in a certa in 
cognit ive state towards the world. Presuppositions are appro- 
pr iate interpretat ions  of  information depending on the agent 
even i f  i t  includes both information and misinformation, 
We now revise the theory of  constraints on the basis of  
the plausible chain of information introduced above. 
We assume the fol lowing condit ions on the modified involves 
relat ion: 
(1) If B is f ixed, then i f  $1 $ S2/B and 62 ~ SS/B 
then $1 ~ SS/B, 
(2) I f  S ? S'/B and B'"( B, where B' is co_ompatible with S, 
then S .~ S'/B'. 
(\]) If S ~) S'/B and B'-( B, where B' is not compatible with S, 
then S e -S'/B'. 
(4) I f  S ~ S'/B then S is c.ompatible with B, that  is, SUB is 
coherent. 
(5) If S ? S-~/B and f is a coherent anchor for  some of  the 
parameters of  B. then S(f) ~ S'(f)/B(f). 
(6) I f  S ~ S'/B where B has no parameters, and i f  B is 
realized by some real situation, then S ~ S' is actual, 
(1) I f  S e S'/B and B- (  8', then S ~ S'/B' or S ~ 
It is to be noticed that  condit ion (7) means that  certa in 
parametric constra ints  can a f fec t  a t ru th  condition as informa- 
tion increases. In the original approach Jn SS i t  is nontr iv ia l  
to represent any nonmonotonicitv in the e f fec t ive  way. 
We now define presupposition in the framework of  SS as 
below: 
(Def ~) A ~ B in tile background condition C i f f  
A -) B/C and -A ,~ B/C Jr #An#B }~ 
175 
A 4 -B/C i f  #A~#B = 
where A, B denote type of situation of the world and IIA, 
t/B, types of situation of the agent's mental states 
relative r.g A, B. 
In the definil;ion we of course assume the involve relation 
satisfies'the above mentioned seven conditions. And if there 
is no agent in the krlowledge sVstem, #A is part of' A since 
any knowledge base is itself  coherent structure in the I~ruth 
eondition. In such a case presuppositions correspond to the 
default as loog as we adopt ordinary inference system. 
We can formalize va|-ious t~pes i l l  presuppositions bv 
making use el' this definition. For example, this definition 
predicts we can do valid inference from rnJsinformation arid do 
invalid inference from correct information. The inferences 
carried out by human being have manv demonstrai:ive characters 
related to tbe cognitive processes of information o f  the world. 
Here we shall regard any information to be used bvtbe  agent 
as a presupposition in a certain context, 
I~. Conclusion 
I~eehanizing presuppositions in natural language is Lr~e 
mosl. importanl:, task Fur pragmatics. Fur the sake of part ia l i ty 
or inf'eL'matiun presented in a senLeoce, SS is more suitable 
than a rllodel-Lheol'etJc selrlaatigs. In eLIr ~,l'eatmeat every 
information is considered useful tbo~J w(9 dispense with such 
ae ideal principle as persistence of information.
