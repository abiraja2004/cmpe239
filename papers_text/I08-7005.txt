Abstract 
In this paper, the authors mainly describe 
about the selections of XML tag set for 
Myanmar National Corpus (MNC). MNC 
will be a sentence level annotated corpus. 
The validity of XML tag set has been 
tested by manually tagging the sample data.  
Keywords: Corpus, XML, Myanmar, 
Myanmar Languages 
1 Introduction 
Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) is one of the 
South-East Asian countries. There are 135 ethnic 
groups living in Myanmar. These ethnic groups 
speak more than one language and use different 
scripts to present their respective languages. There 
are a total of 109 languages spoken by the people 
living in Myanmar [Ethnologue, 2005].  
There are seven major languages, according to 
the speaking population in Myanmar. They are 
Kachin, Kayin/Karen, Chin, Mon, Burmese, 
Rakhine and Shan [Ko Ko & Mikami, 2005]. 
Among them, Burmese is the official language and 
spoken by about 69% of the population as their 
mother tongue [Ministry of Immigration and 
Population, 1995]. 
Corpus is a large and structured set of texts. 
They are used to do statistical analysis, checking 
occurrences or validating linguistic rules on a 
specific universe.1  
In Myanmar, there are a plenty of text for most 
of the languages, especially Burmese and major 
languages, since stone inscription.

Myanmar Language Commission and a number 
of scholars had been collected a number of corpora 
for their specific uses [Htay et al, 2006]. But there 
is no national corpus collection, both in digital and 
non-digital format, until now. 
Since there are a number of languages used in 
Myanmar, the national level corpus to be built will 
include all languages and scripts used in Myanmar. 
It has been named as Myanmar National Corpus or 
MNC, in short form. 
 During the discussion for the selection of 
format for the corpus, XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language), a subset of SGML (Standard 
Generalized Markup Language), format has been 
chosen since XML format can be a long usable and 
possible to keep the original format of the text 
[Burnard. 1996]. The range of software available 
for XML is increasing day by day. Certainly more 
and more NLP related tools and resources are 
produced in it. This in turn makes the necessity of 
selection of XML tag set to start building of MNC. 
MNC will include not only written text but also 
spoken texts. The part of written text will include 
regional and national newspapers and periodicals, 
journals and interests, academic books, fictions, 
memoranda, essays, etc. The part of spoken text 
will include scripted formal and informal 
conversations, movies, etc. 
During the selection of XML tag sets, the 
sample for all the data which will be included in 
building of MNC, has been learnt. 
2 Myanmar National Corpus 
Myanmar is a country of using 109 different 
languages and a number of different scripts 
[Ethnologue, 2005]. In order to do language 
processing for these languages and scripts, it 
becomes a necessity to build a corpus with 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
33
languages and scripts used in Myanmar; at least 
with major languages and scripts, which will 
include almost all areas of documents. 
Among the different scripts used in Myanmar, 
the popular scripts include Burmese script (a 
Brahmi based script), Latin scripts. Building of 
MNC will be helpful for development of Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) tools (such as 
grammar rules, spelling checking, etc) and also for 
linguistic research on these languages and scripts. 
Moreover, since Burmese script is written without 
necessarily pausing between words with spaces, 
the corpus to be built is hoped to be useful for 
developing tools for automatic word segmentation. 
2.1 XML based corpus 
XML is universal format for structured documents 
and data, and can provide highly standardized 
representation frameworks for NLP (Jin-Dong 
KIM et al 2001); especially, the ones with 
annotated corpus based approaches, by providing 
them with the knowledge representation 
frameworks for morphological, syntactic, 
semantics and/or pragmatics information structure. 
Important features are: 
? XML is extensible and it does not consist 
of a fixed set of tags. 
? XML documents must be well-formed 
according to a defined syntax. 
?  XML document can be formally validated 
against a schema of some kind. 
? XML is more interested in the meaning of 
data than its presentation. 
The XML documents must have exactly one 
top-level element or root element. All other 
elements must be nested within it. Elements must 
be properly nested [Young, 2001]. That is, if an 
element starts within another element, it must also 
end within that same element. 
Each element must have both a start-tag and an 
end-tag. The element type name in a start-tag must 
exactly match the name in the corresponding end-
tag and element name are case sensitive. 
Moreover, the advantages of XML for NLP 
includes ontology extraction into XML based 
structured languages using XML Schema. The 
great benefit about XML is that the document itself 
describes the structure of data. 2 
Three characteristics of XML distinguish from 
other markup languages:3  
? its emphasis on descriptive rather than 
procedural markup; 
? its notion of documents as instances of a 
document type and 
? its independence of any hardware or 
software system. 
Since MNC is to be built in XML based format, 
the selection process for tag set of XML become 
an important process. The XML tagged corpus data 
should also keep the original format of the data. 
In order to select XML tag set for MNC, the 
sample data for the corpus has to be collected. The 
format of the sample corpus data has been studied 
for the selection of the XML tag set in appropriate 
with the data format.  
2.2 Structure of a data file at MNC 
The structure of a data file at MNC will include 
two main parts:  information of the corpus file and 
the corpus data. 
The first part, the header part of a corpus file, 
describes the information of a corpus file. The 
information of the corpus file includes the header 
which will provide sensible use of the corpus 
information in machine readable form. In this part, 
the information such as language usage and the 
description of the corpus file will be included. 
The second part, the document part, of a corpus 
file will include the source description of the 
corpus data and the corpus data, the written or 
spoken part of the text, itself. The information of 
the corpus data such as bibliographic information, 
authorship, and publisher information will be 
included in this section. Moreover, the corpus data 
itself will also be included in this section. 
The hierarchically structure of a corpus file at 
MNC will be as shown in figure 1.

3 Selection of necessary XML tag set 
After studying original formats and features of 
texts, to be used in corpus, and the structure of 
the corpus file has been determined, the 
selection procedure for XML tag set has been 
started. 
British National Corpus (BNC)4, American 
National Corpus (ANC)5 had been referenced 
for selection of XML tag set. 
The selection of XML tag set is based on the 
nature of the structure of a data file. The main 
tag for the data file will be named as <mnc> 
which is the abbreviation of Myanmar National 
Corpus. 
A data file contains two main parts, the 
header part and the document part.

3.3 Sample MNC data file 
The Myanmar National Corpus is a major 
resource for linguistic research, as well as 
computational linguistics research, lexicography, 
corpus linguistic research and a resource for the 
development of Myanmar Language teaching 
material because we expect the corpus to be 
continually expanded in the future.  
A sample MNC data is use the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) texts in 
Burmese and Karen, which is one of the major 
languages in Myanmar, has been used to sample 
tagging with the selected XML tag set.

4 Conclusion and Future work 
In this paper, the authors have clearly described 
about the selection of XML tag set for building 
of MNC. Since the word level segmentation for 
Burmese script is not yet available, the corpus 
data will be annotated only up to the sentence 
level in order to be in the same format for all 
Myanmar languages and scripts. 
In order to check whether the selected the 
XML tag set will be enough and useful for 
tagging the corpus data, the sample corpus data 
has been collected by manually tagging the data 
which includes newspapers and periodicals, 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), novels and essays. 
Since the manual tagging to the sample 
corpus data proves that the selected XML tag set 
is enough to cover a variety of data sources, the 
next step is to develop an algorithm for 
automatic tagging the data.
