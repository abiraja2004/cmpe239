ABSTRACT 
The results of an international Delphi poll on 
information linguistics which was carried out 
between 1982 and 1983 are presented. 
As part of conceptual work being done in 
information science at the University of Constance 
an international Delphi poll wss carried out from 
1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a 
mid-term pro@aosis for the development of 
"information linguistics". The term "information 
linguistics" refers to a scientific discipline 
combining the fields of linguistic data processing, 
applied computer science, linguistics, artificial 
intelligence, and information science. A Delphi 
poll is a written poll of experts - carried out in 
this case in two phases. The results of the first 
round were incorporated into the second round, so 
that participants in the poll could react to the 
trends as they took shape. 
I. Some demoscopic data 
I. I Return rate 
Based on sophisticated selection procedures 385 
international experts in the field of information 
linguistics were determined and were sent 
questionnaires in the first round (April 
1982). 90 questionnaires were returned. In the 
second round 360 questionnaires were mailed 
out (January 1983) and 56 were returned, 48 of 
these from experts who had answered in the first 
round. The last questionnaires were accepted at the 
end of June 1 983. 
Overlapping data in the two rounds 
first round (90) second round (56)

In the following we refer to four sets of data: 
Set A 90 from round I 
Set--B 48 from round I with answers in round 2 
8et--C 56 from round 2 
Set--D 48 from round 2 with answers in round I 
But we shall concentrate primarily on Set C becanse 
- according to the Delphi philosophy - t~e data of 
the second round are the most relevant. There 
were 8 persons within Set C who did not answer in 
the first round. But the~ also were aware of 
the results of the first round; therefore a 
Delphi effect was possible. (In the following the 
whole integers refer to absolute numbers; the 
decimal figures to relative/procentual numbers) 
I .2 Qualification accordin~ to academic degree 
The survey singled out highly competent people, as 
reflected in academic degree( data from A and C):

1.3 A~e 
Since Delphi polls are concerned with future 
developments, it has been claimed in the past that 
the age and experience of people in the field 
influence the rating. In this paper, however, we 
cannot prove this hypothesis. Here are the mere 
statistical facts, only taken from Set C (they do 
not differ significantly in the other--sets)

I .4 Experience 
The number of years these trained specialists have 
been working in the general area of information 
linguistics were as follows

These data in particular confirm our impression 
that very qualified and experienced people 
answered the questionnaire. Almost 60% have 
worked longer than 10 years in the general area 
of information linguistics. 
1.5 Size of research groups 
Mos~ of those answering the questionnaire work in a 
research-group. Table 4 gives an impression of the 
size of ~ne groups in SetA and Set_C:

With respect to whether participants are mainly 
involved in research (defined as: basic 
groundwork, mainly of theoretical interest, 
experimental environment) or in applica- 
tion/development (defined as: mainly of interest 
from the point of view of working systems (i.e. 
commercial, industrial), applicable to routine 
tasks) the results were as follows:

Most of the work in information linguistics so far 
has concentrated on English ~generally more than 
80%, with slight differences in the single 
sub-areas, i .e .  acoustic 80.6%, indexing 
82.5%, question-answering83.3%).

2.2 Single topics 
The sub-areas included a varying number of topics 
(from 6 to 15). These topics were chosen based 
on the author's experience in information linguis- 
tics, on a pretest with mostly German researchers 
and practitioners, on advices from members of 
FID/LD, and on long discussions with Don Walker, 
Hans Karlgren, and Udo Hahn. Altogether, there 
were 91 topics in the first round and 90 in the 
second round, as follows:.

ac2 Speaker Dependent Speech Recognition 
ac3 Speaker Independent Speech Recognition 
ac4 Speech Understanding

Each topic was defined by textual paraphrase, 
e.g. for ab4: "procedures of text condensation 
that stress the overall, true-to-scale compression 
of a given text; although varyin~ in length 
(according to the degree of reduction); can be used 
as a substitute for original texts". 
3. Answer parameters for the sub-areas 
3.1 Competence (--CO) 
At the beginning of every sub-area participants 
were requested to rate their competence accord- 
ing to three parameters "good" (with a 
speciaiist's knowledge), "fair" (with a 
working knowledge), and "superficial" (with a 
layman's knowledge). Tab.8 shows the 
self-estimation of competence within the sub-areas 
(data taken from SetC):

3.2 Desirability (=DE) 
With respect to the application oriented subject 
areas the category of desirability was used in 
order to determine the social desirability 
according to the following 4-point scale: "very 
desirable"/++ (will have a positive social effect, 
little or no negative social effect, extremely 
beneficial), "desirable"/+ (in general positive, 
minor negative social effects), "undesirable"/- 
(negative social effect, socially harmful), "very 
ur~esirable"/m (major negative social effect, 
socially not justifiable). 
Tab.9 (data from Set C) shows that the nega- 
tive parameters (--, -)--were never or only sel~om 
used. Information linguistics is not judged - 
accordir~ to the estimation of the experts - as a 
socially harmful scientific discipline. 
4. Answer parameters for the single topics 
The following parameters were used as ratin~ for 
the sub-areas and the single topics. Their 
definitions were given in more detail in the 
questionnaire. 
Tab.10 Evaluation l~arameters

1989 +/-3 
1996 +/-10 
- slightly i. - doubtf, f. 2010 +/-10 
w-un-i. --def. un-f. non-realistic 
These categories of scientific importance, 
feasibility, and date of realization were to be 
judged from tu~o points of view: 
research(=R) - defined as: basic groundwork, mainly 
of ~heoretical interest 
application/development (=A) - defined as: mainly 
of interest for working systems, applicable to 
routine tasks 
Therefore every single topic was evaluated accord- 
ing to six parameters: 
Importance for research I/R 
Importance for application I/A 
Feasibility for research F/R 
Feasibility for application A/A 
Date of realization considering research DR/R 
Date of realization considering application DR/A 
5. More detailed results 
5 ? I Sub-areas 
5.1.1 Competence 
Competence was an important influence on evalua- 
tion. In general one can say that people 
with "good" competence (or more correctly: with 
competence estimation of "good") in a sub-area 
gave topics higher ratings for importance and 
feasibility both from the research and the 
application points of view. Nevertheless, there 
were differences. Those with "good" competence 
differed more widely in evaluations of 
research-oriented topics than in applica- 
tion-oriented topics, whereas those with "super- 
ficial" competence in the sub-areas were closer to 
the average in their evaluations of applica- 
tion-oriented topics than of research-oriented 
topics. Here are some examples of the differences 
(as reflected in the averages of the sub-areas). 
Tab. 11 is to be read as follows: (line I) in the 
sub-area "Acoustic" those with "good" competence 
evaluated 5.6% higher than the average with respect 
to importance for research, whereas people with 
"superficial" competence in the same sub-area 
evaluated 6.9% lower than average. 
Tab.11 Competence differences

In5.4+ 19.8- In6.2+ 19.4- In5.0+ 19.4- 
Ab7.2+ 8.4- 
As can be seen in the column F/R, sometimes the 
general trend is reversed (Semantic: values from 
"competent" participants are lower than from par- 
ticipants with "superficial" competence). 
5.1.2 Desirability 
There is also a connection between desirability and 
the values of importance and feasibility. Those who 
gave high ratin~s for desirability (DE++) in 
general gave higher values to the single topics in 
the respective sub-areas, both in comparison to 
the average values and to the values of those who 
gave only high desirability (DE+) to a given 
sub-area. The differences between DE++ and DE+ are 
even higher than those between C/g und C/s. 0nly 
the F/R data in the translation and retrieval areas 
are lower for D++ than for D+, in all other cases 
the D++ values are higher. Some examples:

The average values in Tab. 13 and 14 should not 
be over-interpreted. In particular, ranking is 
unjustified. One cannot simply conclude that, 
say, the sub-area "Semantics" (92.6) is more 
important than that of "Abstracting" (75.6) with 
respect to research because the average value 
is higher; or that Indexing (79.2) is more 
feasible from an application point of view 
than Abstracting (52.3). $uch conclusions may be 
true, and this is why the values in Tab. 13 and 
14 are given, but the parameters should actually 
only be applied to the single topics in the 
sub-areas. Cross-group ranking is not allowed 
for methodological reasons. 
But nevertheless the 
It is obvious that 
general true: 
data are interesting enough. 
the following relation is in 
I/R (-values) > I/A > F/R > F/A 
There are some exceptions to this general rule, 
such as Re-I/A>I/R (both in Set A and Set C); 
Ha-F/R>I/R (in Set C); (Re-F/R ant F/A)>I/R--(in 
Set_C); and I1-F/R>~/R(both in Set_A and SetC). 
There seems to be a non-trivial g~p between impor- 
tance and feasibility (both with respect to 
research and application). In other words, there 
are more problems than solutions. And there is an 
even broader gap between application and research. 
From a practical point of view there is some skep- 
sis concerning the possibility of solving important 
research problems. And what seems to be feasible 
from a research point of view looks different from 
an application one. 
The values in the second round are in general 
higher than in the first one. This is an argument 
against the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that the 
feedback-mechanism - i.e. that the data of the 
previous round are made known at the start of the 
following round -has an averaging effect. The 
increase-effect can probably be explained by the 
fact that the percentage of qualified and "com- 
p etent" people was higher in the second round perhaps these were the ones who were motivated to 
take on the burden of a second round) - and, as 
Tab.11 shows, people who rated themselves "com- 
petent" tend to evaluate higher. 
Between the two rounds the decline in the 
sub-areas "Software" and "Hardware" (apart from the 
parameter F/R) is striking. There is an overall 
increase for '%lorphology" and "Information Lan- 
guages" for all parameters, and a dramatic increase 
for the topics in "Indexing" for F/R (9.7%), and a 
dramatic decline for the "Translation"- and "Ques- 
tion-Answering"-topics for the parameter F/A (9.8 
and 8.4%). 
The dates of realization do not change dramati- 
cally? On the average there is a difference of one 
year (and this makes sense because there was almost 
one year between round I and 2). There is a ten- 
dency from a research point of view for the expec- 
tation of realization to be somewhat earlier from 
an application standpoint. But the differences are 
not so dramatic as to justify the conclusion that 
researchers are more optimistic than 
developers/practitioners. 
5.2 Single topics 
Tab. 15 and 16 show the two highest rated topics in 
each sub-area in the first two columns and the two 
lowest rated topics in each sub-area in the last 
two columns. These represent average data from 
Set C. The four columns in the middle show the 
estimation of participants who work in research or 
application, respectively. As part of the demos- 
copic data it was determined whether participants 
work more in research or in application (cf. 
Tab.6). Notice that both groups answered from a 
research and application point of view. In a more 
detailed analysis (which will be published later) 
this-  and other aspects- can be pursued. In 
Tab.15 and 16 the data for very high importance 
(*+) and high importance (+) have been added 
together.

Finally I would like to thank all those who par- 
ticipated in the Delphi rounds. It was an extremely 
time-consuming task to answer the questionnaire, 
which was more like a book than a folder. I hope 
the results justify the efforts. The analysis would 
not have been possible without the help of m~ 
colleagues - Udo Hahn for the conceptual desi~a, 
and Dr.J.Staud together with Annette Woehrle, Frank 
Dittmar and Gerhard Schneider for the statistical 
analysis. This project has been partially financed 
by the FID/LD-comnittee and by the "Bundesminis- 
terium fuer Forschung und Technologie/ Gesellschaft 
fuer Information und Dokumentation", Grant PT 
200.08.
