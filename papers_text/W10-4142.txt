Abstract 
Chinese word segmentation is the initial 
step for Chinese information processing. 
The performance of Chinese word seg-
mentation has been greatly improved by 
character-based approaches in recent 
years. This approach treats Chinese 
word segmentation as a character-word-
position-tagging problem. With the help 
of powerful sequence tagging model, 
character-based method quickly rose as 
a mainstream technique in this field. 
This paper presents our segmentation 
system for evaluation of CIPS-SIGHAN 
2010 in which method combining char-
acter-based and subsequence-based tag-
ging is applied and conditional random 
fields (CRFs) is taken as sequence tag-
ging model. We evaluated our system in 
closed and open tracks on four corpuses, 
namely Literary, Computer science, 
Medicine and Finance, and reported our 
evaluation results.  
1 Introduction  
In Chinese information processing, word is the 
minimum unit to be used independently and 
meaningfully. But, Chinese sentences are writ-
ten as string of characters without clear delimit-
ers. Therefore, the first step in Chinese informa-
tion processing is to identify the sequence of 
words in a sentence, namely Chinese word seg-
mentation. It?s the foundation of syntax analysis, 
semantic analysis and discourse comprehension, 
and also the important section of machine trans-
lation, question answering, information retrieval 
and information extraction(Jiang Wei, et al, 
2007; Liu Qun, et al, 2004). 
The research of Chinese word segmentation 
has been advancing rapidly and has gained 
many exciting achievements in recent 
years(Huang Changning, Zhao Hai. 2007; Song 
Yan, et al, 2009), especially after the First In-
ternational Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-
off held in 2003. In this field, character-based 
tagging attracts more eyes and almost all excel-
lent systems in evaluations has adopted this 
technology thought(Huang Changning, Zhao 
Hai. 2007; Zhao Hai, Jie Chunyu. 2007). In 
2002, Xue presented the first paper about char-
acter-based tagging on the 1st international 
workshop of special interest group on Chinese 
language processing, SIGHAN. He segmented 
Chinese words with four character tags: LL, RR, 
MM and LR, depending on its position within a 
word using a maximum entropy tagger(Xue N 
W, Converse S P. 2002). Huang et al imple-
mented character-based segmentation system 
with conditional random fields, six word-
position tags: B, B2, B3, M, E, S,  and TMPT-6 
and achieved very excellent results(Huang 
Changning, Zhao Hai. 2006; Huang Changning, 
Zhao Hai. 2007). On this base, Zhao hai pre-
sented an effective subsequence-based tagging 
for Chinese word segmentation(Zhao Hai, Jie 
Chunyu. 2007). All these references considered 
Chinese segmentation as character or subse-
quence tagging problem and implemented with 
statistical language models.  
The evaluation for Chinese word segmenta-
tion in CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 has two subtasks: 
word segmentation for simplified Chinese text 
and for traditional Chinese text. The simplified 
Chinese corpuses are offered by Institute of 
Computing Technology(ICT) and Peking Uni-
versity(PKU), and the traditional Chinese cor-
puses are offered City University of Hong 
Kong(CityU). The corpuses involved four do-
mains: literary, computer science, medicine and 
finance. Considering plenty of abbreviations, 
numeric and other non-Chinese strings, our 
segmentation system adopted a method combin-
ing character-based and subsequence-based tag-
ging, and took CRFs as sequence tagging model. 
CRFs is a kind of conditional probability model 
for sequence tagging presented by Lafferty et al 
in 2001(Lafferty J, et al, 2001). In our experi-
ment, the CRF++0.53 toolkit1 is used. CRF++ 
is a simple, customizable, and open source im-
plementation of CRFs for segmenting sequential 
data. This paper described our system partici-
pating CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 and presented our 
word-position tag set and feature template set 
and their change in open tracks. Finally, we re-
port the results of our evaluation. 
2 Combining character-based and subse-
quence-based tagging for Chinese word 
segmentation 
In character-based tagging approach to Chinese 
word segmentation, it tags the word-position of 
non-Chinese characters, such as punctuation, 
letter words and numeric, just like what to do 
with Chinese characters. This method works 
well when there is a small quantity of these 
characters. But plenty of these characters will 
cut down the segmentation performance, 
especially some abbreviation and programming 
statement in computer science domain. 
Considering this, we used a method combining 
character-based and subsequence-based tagging 
that is to take an English word or programming 
statement as a subsequence to tag its word-
position. The correct tag for one-character word 
is S. 
2.1  Word-position tag set 
In the closed track of traditional Chinese and 
simplified Chinese, four word-position tag set is 
used: B (Beginning of word), M(Middle of 
word), E(End of word) and S(one-character 
word). The tag set is also used in open tracks of 
traditional Chinese. And we used six word-
position tag set for open tracks of simplified 
Chinese: B(Beginning of word), B2(2nd 
character of word), B3(3rd character of word)

M(Middle of word), E(End of word) and S(one-
character word). 
2.2 Feature templates 
To define the relationship of some specific 
language components or information in context 
and some being forecasted things is the main 
function of feature template. It is generally 
considered that feature template is abstracted 
from a group of context features on same 
attributes.  
In CRF++0.53 toolkit, there are two kind of 
templates: Unigram template and Bigram tem-
plate. In word-position tagging Chinese seg-
mentation, available features are rather limited. 
The main feature needed to take into account is 
character feature, which includes current char-
acter, previous and next character. Jiang, Wang 
and Guan (2007) abstracted the character fea-
tures into six templates according different dis-
tances from current character. They are Uni-
gram templates. The type and meaning of these 
templates are presented in table 1. When train-
ing with CRFs model, these templates will be 
extended to thousands of features and every fea-
ture has a group of corresponding feature func-
tions. All these functions are very important to 
CRFs model learning. Seen from table 1, Bi-
gram feature has only one template: T-1T0 which 
describes the word-position transfer feature of 
two adjacent characters or subsequences. This 
feature extends limited features in training. 
Take four-WORD-POSITION-tag for instance, 
it can be extended into sixteen features. In our 
tracks, open or closed one, the seven templates 
in table 1: C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, C-1C1, T-1T0 
are used.

3 Experiments and results 
3.1 Data set 
Our training and test corpuses are gained from 
evaluation conference. The training and test 
corpuses of simplified Chinese are offered by 
ICT and PKU, while traditional Chinese by 
CityU. These corpuses involved in four domains: 
literary(A), computer science(B), medicine(C), 
finance(D). In addition, we also use the 
CityU2005 training corpuses which gained from 
the Bakeoff2005 for open track. 
3.2 Evaluation metrics 
Five evaluation metrics: precision(P), recall(R), 
f-measue(F1), out-of-vocabulary words recall 
rate (OOV RR) and In-vocabulary words recall 
rate (IV RR) are used in our evaluation experi-
ments.  
3.3 Experiments and results 
We adopted combining character-based and 
subsequence-based tagging for Chinese word 
segmentation, and conducted closed track ex-
periments on these corpuses. Four word-
position tag set(B, M, E, S) and seven tem-
plates(C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, C-1C1, T-1T0) are 
adopted in closed tracks of simplified and tradi-
tional Chinese. Our results of the closed tracks 
are described in Table 2.  
In our open tracks of simplified Chinese, we 
used six word-position tag set: B, B2, B3, M, E, 
S and seven templates same with closed tracks. 
Tag set and templates used in open tracks of 
traditional Chinese are same with closed tracks, 
too. In open tracks of traditional Chinese, we 
trained the combination of CityU2005 and cor-
pus from this conference with CRFs model. The 
results of open tracks are shown in Table 3.

4 Conclusion 
As a fundamental task in Chinese information 
processing, Chinese segmentation gained more 
eyes in recent years and character-based tag-
ging becomes the main segmentation technol-
ogy. This paper describes our Chinese word 
segmentation system for CIPS-SIGHAN 2010. 
Then we present our word-position tag set and 
feature templates used in closed tracks and 
change of these parameters in open tracks. Fi-
nally, we report the results of the evaluation.
