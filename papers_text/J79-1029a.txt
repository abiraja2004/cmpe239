Executive Commitbee Meeting 
The C m i t t e e  decided to establish permanently the reduction of 
meeting registration fees for students, but not t o  introduce a 
reduced membership fee 
The format of the Journal was discussed; a questionnaire is to 
be d i s t r i b u t e d  t o  members, ca l l ing  f o r  their opinions about 
several combinations of printed and microfiched publication. 
The Committee decided to offer a limited subsidy to the news- 
letter proposed by Hans KarPgren of Stockholm; the proposa l  is 
f o r  10 issues per  year, free distribution, and a publication 
l i m i t e d  t o  announcements of significant events and other matters 
of general interest, with occasional short technical  notes.

A forthcoming r e p o r t  in the ALLC Bulletin written by Herbert 
Bruderer describes a demonstration canducted by Peter P. Toma 
of LATSEC, Inc., in the Enstitut fu r  I n f o m a t i k  of the Univer- 
sity of Zurich. The r e p o r t  describes the s y s t b  as having 
been proved practical by the American Air Force since 1970, 
and says that the Systran system was used for the Apollb-Soyuz 
flight. 
Mr. Bruderer writes that the text was furnished by the Qrenoble 
MT group; he descr ibes  the program as requi r ing  a large computer. 
According to his report, a Russian text of 30,060 words was 
translated into English in 6 minutes on an IBM 370/155.

Research Council. Emphasis is placed on interdisciplinary studies 
and on applications which bring to Soviet studies insights of 
sociology, social psychology, cultural anthropology, economics, 
law, and geography. Only in exceptional cases will grants be 
made i n  suppor t  of travel for brief visits abroad or. to relieve 
scholars of the necessity of teaching beyond the conventional

1. ? n t r o d u c t i o n  
This paver describes a computer model of s~stsmic grammar, a 
prammar for n a t u r a l  languages developed by H a l l i d a y  and 
colleagues at Univers i tv  College, London (Hal l iday , 1961, 197fl). 
Svstemic grammar has recentlv been o f  i n t e r e s t  t o  comoutational 
grammarians, arimarily as a result of the imn~essive work .of 
Winograd. ( 1972 ) , who develoaed a natural l a n p u a ~ e  understandinp 
system one component o f  which was s t r o n g l v  influenced bv the  
~ r i n c i p l e s  of systemic grammar. More recently, Power (1974) has 
a l s o  investigated how svstemic pramnar can be used t o  ,analvse 
natural language. There have,  however, been no attempts to use a 
computer to invest i .gate systemic grammar itself. As Friedman 
(1971) says, in introducing her computer model of 
transformational grammar, adequate n a t u r a l  lanquage grammars are 
bound to be so complex t h a t  some mechanical a i d  in investigating 
their ~ r o ~ e r t i e s  will be mandatory. 
The a ims ,  t h e n ,  of d e v e l o ~ i n g  a computer model  of svsteric 
prammar are threefold. First, t h e  model enables  the  Rrammar to 
be t e s t e d ,  i . e .  it enables contradictions, amhip,uities and 
incomnletenesses  i n  the grammas to be found.  Pecondlv ,  t h e  model 
enables systemic grammar i t s e l f  to he imnroved, s lnce t h e  
consequences of a d f u s t i n p  parameters and rules can be more e a s i l v  
followed. And, t h i r d l y ,  the model serves as a demonstration of 
how systemic grammar 'works ' 
Earlier d e s c r i ~ t i o n s  of systemic grammar were somewhat 
ihcomplete ,  b u t  that of Hudson (1971) seems s u f f i c i e n t l v  ~ r e c i s e  
t o  encourage t h e  f e e l i n g  that  a computer program could be based 
upon it. The progpam desc r ibed  below gene ra t e s  (in t h e  
linguistic sense )  n a t u r a l  language s e n t e n c e s ,  i .e. " a s s igns

2 .  The Mechanics of Svstemic Grammap 
This  sect ion b r i e f l u  d e s c r i b e s  t h e  ~ e n e r a t i v e  apnaratus of 
systemic grammar - f o r  a fuller d i s c u s s i o n ,  and for l i n g u i s t i c  
j u s t i f i c a t i o n s  of the  procgsses, the reader i s  referred t o  
Hudson (1971), from which tfrc? example gripmrnar and gene ra t i ons  
given later are taken. 
I n  sys temic  grgmmar, ' l s t r uc tu r e s  are entirely medictable 
from features: given a11 of an item's features ,  w e  can p r e d i c t  
e x a c t l y  what i t s  s t r u c t u r e .  w i l l  beff (Hudson. pg 8 7 ) .  I n  
general t'erms, an jtemTs fearures or classes are those 
categories to which it belongs i r r e s ~ e c t i v e  of t h e   articular 
sentknce t o  which the i tem belongs; an item's func t i ons  are 
- 
those c a t e g o r i e s  t o  which it belongs as a r e s u l t  of i t s  ro le  i n  
a sentence. For example, 
"mustN has the features MODAL-VERB , FINITE-VERB (among others 
and i n  t h e  sentence 
"Must it grow darker?" has the functions !PRE-SUBJECT, 
! MOOD-FOCUS (among others 
( A  preceding ! will be used t o  distinguish funct ions  from 
features.) An item's structure i s  defined by i t s  immediate 
constituents ' functions and the sequence i n  which they occur, 
~ i v e n  all the features that  an item has, tKe i tem's  
structure may be determined, according to systemic hnammar, by 
the sequential  application of rules of four kinds : 
(1)  feature-realisation rules 
In the simplest case, these rules a r e  of the form "if item 
has feature x then i t s  structure w i l l  contain function yv - y is 
said t o  be the rea l i sa t ion  p f  x .  Some rules ape conditional i n  
that the r e a l i s ~ t i o n  only holds i f  certain o the r  features are or 
are not present. Also,  some rules  specify that  tktb functions 
must be conflated, i . e .  bath functions apply t o  the same immediate 
constituent. (Further de ta i l s  of these an? the fo l lowing  rules 
ape given later when the program i s  d i s c u s s e d . )  The application 
of the feature-realisation rules provides  an unordered s o t  of 
funct ions ,  some o f  which may be conf la ted .  
( 2 )  structure-buildinp rules 
These rules expand and arder th?a set of fwnctions to provide 
the structure of the item. Structure-building rules are themselves 
of four k i n d s ,  which i n  the  simplest case are of the following form: 
(-a) a d d i t i o n  rule3: "if funct ion y (or some combination of 
funct ions)  i s  present, then so must be function z (oassibly 
conflated with other Functions 1". 
(b) conflation rules: "if some condition expressed i n  terms 
- ~ 
of functions is satisfied then some function must be conflated 
with cer ta in  other functions". 
( c )  sequence rules: "if two functicns y and z are  resent 
then y must be canflated with, orecede o r  not  follow z" . 
(d l  compatibility rules: "functiops v and z must not be 
conf lated" . 
Addition and conflation rules are onlv applicable  i f  the resultant 
structure does not  conflict with a sequence or coma t ib i l i t y  rule. 
Structure-building rules are no t  extrinsically ordered in any wav. 
After applying these rules, we have a complete. specification of 
the item's atructum , i n  that  we have spec i f i ed  function- 
"bundlesw, each of which consists of the funct ions of one sf ?he 
immediate constituents of the i t e m .  
( 3 function-realisation rules 
These rules specify  which features are implied bv an item's 
functions. They are of the form "if a structure contains 
function y the  corresponding item must have feature x l ' .  Applied 
to the function-bundles obtained from (21, these rules h e l p  to 
determine the features possessed by the immediate constituents. 
( 4) systems 
System networks spec i fy  which features are implied by other 
f e a t u r e s .  These networks are equivalent  to rules of the form 
"if feature x is present then so is one (or a l l )  of a s e t  of 
features, and conversely". These rules expand a s e t  of feature$ 
(possibly t h e  result of applying ( 3 )  , n o t  necessarily i n t o  a 
complete set, since some f e a t u r e s  mav be freely selected. "he 
feature-realisation rules may then  be recursivelv a p p l i e d  to 
this s e r  of featuren, if reQuF~ed+ 
3 ,  The Promam 
The program reads i n  a d e f i n i t i o n  of a systeric gramwar 
(provided as d a t a  so t h a t  it may be changed wi thou t  n e c e s s i t a t i n g  
major modifications to the program) and generates a structure 
from a s p e c i f i e d  l i s t  of f e a t u ~ e s .  The i n t e r e s t e d  reader should  
have no d i f f i c u l t y  in r e l a t i n g  t h e  rules given below to thb 
grammar given by Hudson ( p ~ .  53-101). The rules are shown i n  t h e  
form i n  which t h e v  are presented to the propam,  and are numbered 
to ease explanation and unders tanding  of the program's execution. 
In order t o  enable the  reader t o  follow the computer g e n e r a t i o n s  
given later, an English i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  of s e l e c t e d  rules f o l l m ~  : 
(1) feature-realisation rules 
Rule 1'3 (below) means "if an item has the feature 
INTERROGATIVE then,  provided it also is DEPENDENT, its structure 
contains the function !QUESTION (which is thereby introduced if 
not  already present) conflated w i t h  !BINDER1'.  Similarly, rule 32

taken unless there are environmental reasons for selecting 
another,  
The rules of the grammar are in fact input and stored in 
the form of McCarthy l is ts  (McCarthy , 1965) , and the program 
is written in a list-processing extension of BCPL (Self, 1975). 
It is important to realise t h a t  the Tules are not  
extrinsically ordered in any way, and t h a t  the program may 
( c o n c e p M l y )  execute the rules in any order, with the 
objective of  finding a structure consistent with a l l  ru les .  
Hence, rules are executed recursively, with backtracking when 
inconsistenices become apparent.

The progrdm may then generate the features .of t h e  immediate 
constituents , using the function-real isat ion rules and sys terns , 
and then repeat the above process t o  detemnine the structure of 
the immediate constituents. The first stage o f  t h i s  is indicated 
above. 
Of course, t h i s  is a particularly simple sentence and structure 
designed to make it easy to see what the  pTogram does, and it 
should be clear that considerably more complicated grammars can 
also be handled. The generative process i8self will not  usually 
Dnvolve such s traightfarward intermediate s,tructbres or proceed 
so immediately to  the final s tructure .  For example, the 
generation of the structure of a sentence such as. "Must it gr& 
darker?", requiring f ive  'loops' of the structure-building rules 
before a structure compatible with a l l  rules i s  obtained, is as

4 Conclusion 
' h e  obvious canelusion - that the mechanics of svstemic 
grammar (as described by Hudson) are su f f i c i en t l y  well-defined 
to form the basis of a computer vodel - is, f o r  l i n g u i s t i c  
descriptions , a s ign i f i can t  one. However, the program also 
demonstratks that  some pule-descriptions require c l a r i f  ieation . 
For examle, feature-realisation and function-realisation rules 
are impI i c i t l y  unordered (since features and functions are 
unordered) , m, more precisely,  the rules are to be considered 
to apply simultaneously. This  causes problems wi th  those rules 
which prevent features being introduced (e.g.  rules such as 
Feat-ure-realisation rule 32, which means "if !SUBLTECT is ~resent 
the realisation 1s as stated,  otherwise the first function, i .e .  
!ACTOR, must not be introduced by any other  feature-realis ation 
rulew). The solution seems to  be to reapply the  rules, 
recursively, until a structura is produced which is combatible 
with a l l  the rules. 
More seriously, the expectatiop tha t  the structure obtained 
is independent of the order of a ~ p l i c a t i o n  of structure-building 
rules is not realised, a t  least  for t h e  grammar specified. Polr 
example, considering t+re second of the above generations and 
applying rules SQ 1, SQ 2, ADDN 2 ,  SO 1, ADDN 1 (in t h a t  order)  
to the s e t  of functions obtained by t he  feature-realisation 
rules, we generate

This strmctuH cannot sa t i s  fv both sequence rules , i .e. the 
generative process is blocked. Clearly, either the grammar 
requires modification or i t  does matrer which order the 
s tructure-bailding rules are applied.  Hudson (personal 
communi"cation) has concluded that there, are l i n g u i s t i c  grounds 
fo r  ordering e tructure-building rules , s.o t hq t  ' abnormalT cases 
precede 'normal' ones, with the latter only applying i f  the 
former had not  already been applied. Whether it i e  possible to 
do sc consistently requires further experimentation. 
Further possible extensions to the work could involve  
trying t o  specify a lexicon so tha t  t h e  generative process ends 
up with a structure with words as leaves, and one could also 
attempt to apply the rules in reverse, i . e .  To start with  a 
s t r ing  of lords and produce a etructurdl description. Both 
problems are, of course, very d3f f i cu l t  ones.

Interpretation E Integration 
In a d d i t i o n  to being use fu l ,  C in the f i n a l  analysis, 
necessary for practical  problems in computer understanding or 
dacoding of bulaaa lasguage, this theory [see m y  D E S C ~ I P T I O Y S ]  
is shown to allow disambiguation of procouns v h i c h  are l e f t  
as aabiquous by contemporary theories of semantics or s y n t a x ,  
but v h i c h  in  fact  as2 no+ ambiguous. As will be note3  but- 
not eiplored, t h i s  t,heory d l s o  allows the consistect 
deteraination of the focus of a sentence from its c o n t o x t ,  
i.e. not using  positiw or prosod-ic features. 
The thaory of C-cets is i n  r a p i d  s v o l u t i o n o 2 .  The 
versioc described here is chosen partly-  because it matches 
the desp  structures o b t a i n z d  by the present  Engllsh graamsr  
of t h e  TkUl  project a t  t h e  Universite de Montreal [ TAUfl].  Ir. 
that system, a sentence is reducsd  to i t s  d e e p  s t t l u c t u ~ e  t?) a 
Q-systemoa grammar. T h i s  deep structure would then be 
converted into a D-net, a t-nrporary C-net, which i s  t h e n  
interpreted lexically (i-.e. l ex ica l  items are replakcti b y  
their concepts) E integrated i n t o  an overall C p n e t .  T h i s  C- 
nat represents the integrated meaning of that E p r p v i o u s  
sentences. I n  this theory, successful i n t e g r a t i o n  models the 
comptehensidn of the senteace, as described i n  my L C G C ] .  The 
dnterpretatiori E in tegra t ion  of D-nets are described here,  
with a demonstration of how later sentencos ars disambiguatad 
ill terms of the colnprehension of the ear l ier  ones. 
3x1 c o n t i n u a t i o n s  (a) & (b) belov ,  the s y n t a c t i c  
structures are not s i g n i f i c a n t l y  different. Yet both 
pronouns -OIL s h e  refer unambigwaus ly  to d i f f e r e n t  p e o p l e ;  to Mary 
ir, (a) G to S u s i e  i n  (b). 
Nary told Sahn that S u s h  was corning, 
(a) but shs s a i d  it! s o f t l y .  
(b )  but she didn't arrive for an houj. 
Any  n o n d i n t r ! g r a t i v e  semantic theory is forced to cdaim that 
these -.- shews both refer to t h e  same person, or that they are 
both ambiguous. E i t h e r  a lk . ernat ive  is wrong;  these pronouns  
r o f s r  u n a r n b i g u ~ u s l y  to different p e o p l e .  A sentence o f t s n  
picks u p  r n ~ a n i n g  from its l i n g u i s t i c  con t ex t .  Ths same 
sentence may express d i f f e r e n t  t h i n g s  ir. d i f f e r e n t  contexts .  
The  mechanism by which this can h a p p e n  is s x p l a i n e d  below.. 
The  only way to determint; t h e  ~ o r r e c t  referents of  
these p r o n o u n s  is to taks account ot t h e  relationships 
e x p r e s s e d  by t h e  verbs  ---- t o l d  t ---...f said be-h comiw E --I-I- arrive. An 
adequate way of doing this is to build a C-ncr't ? t h e  1st 
sentence & t h e n  i n t e g r a t e  t h a   continuation^ i n , to  it, as
