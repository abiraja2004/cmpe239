Abstract
We present an innovative application of dia-
logue processing concepts to educational tech-
nology. In a previous corpus analysis of peer
learning dialogues, we found that initiative
and initiative shifts are indicative of learning,
and of learning-conducive episodes. We have
incorporated this finding in KSC-PaL, a peer
learning agent. KSC-PaL promotes learning
by encouraging shifts in task initiative.
1 Introduction
Collaborative learning has been shown to be an ef-
fective mode of learning for potentially all partic-
ipants (Brown and Palincsar, 1989; Fisher, 1993;
Tin, 2003). While collaboration in dialogue has long
been researched in computational linguistics (Chu-
Carroll and Carberry, 1998; Constantino-Gonza?lez
and Suthers, 2000; Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997;
Soller, 2004), the study of peer learning from a com-
putational perspective is still in the early stages.
Previous research has suggested several mecha-
nisms that explain why peer learning is effective.
Among them are: self-directed explaining (Chi et
al., 1994), other-directed explaining (Ploetzner et
al., 1999; Roscoe and Chi, 2007) and Knowledge
Co-construction ? KCC for short (Hausmann et al,
2004). KCC episodes are defined as portions of the
dialogue in which students are jointly constructing
a shared meaning of a concept required for problem
solving. This last mechanism is the most interesting
from a peer learning perspective because it is a truly

collaborative construct and also because it is consis-
tent with the widely accepted constructivist view of
learning.
In our previous work (Kersey et al, 2009) we de-
rived a model of peer interactions that operational-
izes KCC via the notion of initiative shifts in dia-
logue. This model was based on an extensive corpus
analysis in which we found a strong relationship be-
tween initiative shifts and KCC episodes. A paired t-
test showed that there were significantly more initia-
tive shifts in the annotated KCC episodes compared
with the rest of the dialogue ( t(57) = 3.32, p =
0.0016). The moderate effect difference between
the two groups (effect size = 0.49 ) shows that there
is a meaningful increase in the number of initia-
tive shifts in KCC episodes compared with problem
solving activity outside of the KCC episodes. Addi-
tionally, we found moderate correlations of learning
with both KCC (R2 = 0.14, p = 0.02) and with
initiative shifts (R2 = 0.20, p = 0.00).
We have incorporated this model in an innovative
peer learning agent, KSC-PaL, that is designed to
collaborate with a student to solve problems in the
domain of computer science data structures.
2 KSC-PaL
KSC-PaL, has at its core the TuTalk System (Jordan
et al, 2007), a dialogue management system that
supports natural language dialogue in educational
applications. In developing KSC-PaL we extended
TuTalk in three ways.
The first extension is a user interface (see Fig-
ure 1) which manages communication between
TuTalk and the student. Students interact with KSC-
17

PaL using natural language and graphical actions.
The student input is processed by the interface and
its related modules into an appropriate format and
passed to TuTalk. Since TuTalk?s interpretation
module is not able to appropriately handle all stu-
dent utterances, a human interpreter assists in this
process. The interpreter receives a student utterance
along with a list of possible matching concepts from
TuTalk (see Figure 4). The interpreter then selects
the most likely matching concepts from TuTalk thus
assisting in natural language interpretation. If the
student utterance doesn?t match any of these con-
cepts, a second list of concepts, containing student
initiative utterances, are presented to the interpreter.
If none of these match then all known concepts are
presented to the interpreter for matching. Note that
the interpreter has a limited, predetermined set of
choices, corresponding to the concepts that TuTalk
is aware of. In this way, his/her intervention is cir-
cumscribed.
The second addition is the incorporation of a stu-
dent model that allows the KSC-PaL to track the
current state of problem solving and the student?s
knowledge in order to guide its behavior. TuTalk?s
student model was replaced with one that incorpo-
rates problem solution graphs (Conati et al, 2002).
Solution graphs are Bayesian networks where each
node represents either an action required to solve the
problem or a concept required as part of problem
solving. A user?s utterances and actions are then
matched to these nodes. This provides KSC-PaL
with information related to the student?s knowledge
of problem solving concepts as well as the current
topic under discussion.
Thirdly, a planning module was added to TuTalk
to make decisions on implementation of problem
solving goals and responses to student initiative in
order to manage shifts in initiative. The planning
module includes an initiative tracker that codes turns
with with either student initiative or agent initiative
using one classifier for natural language utterances
and a separate classifier for drawing and coding ac-
tions. Once a turn is classified, it is determined
whether a shift in initiative has occurred by compar-
18
ing the current classification with the classification
of the previous turn. An average level of initiative
shifts is then computed by dividing the number of
initiative shifts by the total number of turns. Based
on the initiative level, KSC-PaL encourages initia-
tive shifts by using prompts, hedging, requesting
feedback from the student and encouraging student
criticism by intentionally making errors in problem
solving.
Our evaluation of KSC-PaL (Kersey et al, June
2010) found that students learned using the agent
and that KSC-PaL was was successful in encourag-
ing shifts in initiative.
3 Demonstration Outline
We will demonstrate a problem solving episode with
KSC-PaL where a user will interact with the agent as
a student. Specifically we will show how KSC-PaL
attempts to manage the level of initiative and how
KSC-PaL reacts to student initiative.
1. Amy: hi there, are you ready
to start?
2. Mary: sure
3. Amy: where to begin?
4. Mary: i don?t know
5. Amy: maybe we should draw this
6. Amy: do you want to draw it?
7. Mary: ok
8. Amy: so, line 1 ...
9. Mary: how?s that?
10. Amy: hmmm
11. Amy: line 2: first.next=
second.next
(Mary diagrams the code segment)
12. Mary: there i finished it
13. Amy: looks good
14. Amy: i think we?re done drawing
15. Mary: yes
16. Amy: basically, it switches the
first and second elements
17. Mary: right
18. Amy: ill write the explanation
19. Mary: ok
Figure 2: Problem Solving Example
Figure 2 shows an excerpt from a typical prob-
lem solving session. Amy, the agent, attempts to
maintain a balanced level of initiative either by en-
couraging the student (Mary) to take initiative, or by
taking initiative. In lines 10 and 11, the agent uses a
prompt followed by repetition of the problem solv-
ing goal to encourage the student to retain the initia-
tive. However, in line 16 the agent takes initiative by
proposing a solution to the problem.
KSC-PaL is also able to manage the situation
where the student takes initiative in the dialogue in
an unanticipated manner, as shown in Figure 3. In
line 3, Mary asks a question that is not expected
at this point in the problem solving process and the
agent responds appropriately in line 4. KSC-PaL is
able to respond to a set of student initiations derived
from corpus data, such as the one in this excerpt.
Additionally, the agent responds in a generic man-
ner to other unanticipated initiations and directs the
student back to problem solving.
1. Mary: let?s look at the code
2. Amy: so, i think first and
second both equal bat
3. Mary: is second a reference or
a node?
4. Amy: second is a reference
