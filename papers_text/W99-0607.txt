Abstract  
Experiments are presented which measure 
the perplexity reduction derived from incor- 
porating into the predictive model utilised in 
a standard tag-n-gram part-of-speech tagger, 
contextual information from previous entences 
of a document. The tagset employed is the 
roughly-3000-tag ATR General English Tagset, 
whose tags are both syntactic and semantic in 
nature. The kind of extrasentential informa- 
tion provided to the tagger is semantic, and 
consists in the occurrence or non-occurrence, 
within the past 6 sentences of the document 
being tagged, of words tagged with particular 
tags from the tagset, and of boolean combina- 
tions of such conditions. In some cases, these 
conditions are combined with the requirement 
that the word being tagged belong to a partic- 
ular set of words thought most likely to ben- 
efit from the extrasentential information they 
are being conjoined with. The baseline model 
utilized is a maximum entropy-based tag-n-  
gram tagging model, embodying a standard 
tag-n-gram approach to tagging: i.e. con- 
straints for tag trigrams, bigrams, and and the 
word-tag occurrence frequency of the specific 
word being tagged, form the basis of prediction. 
Added into to this baseline tagging model is the 
extrasentential semantic information just indi- 
cated. The performance of the tagging model 
with and without the added contextual knowl- 
edge is contrasted, training from the 850,000- 
word ATR General English Treebank, and test- 
ing on the accompanying 53,000-word test tree- 
bank. Results are that a significant reduction in 
testset perplexity is achieved via the added se- 
mantic extrasentential nformation of the richer 
model. The model with both long-range tag 
triggers and more complex linguistic onstraints 
achieved a perplexity reduction of 21.4%. 
1 Int roduct ion 
It appears intuitively that information from 
earlier sentences in a document ought to help 
reduce uncertMnty as to a word's correct part- 
of-speech tag. This is especially so for a 
large semantic and syntactic tagset such as the 
roughly-3000-tag ATR General English Tagset 
(Black et al, 1996; Black et al, 1998). And in 
fact, (Black et al, 1998) demonstrate a signif- 
icant "tag trigger-pair" effect. That is, given 
that certain "triggering" tags have already oc- 
curred in a document, the probability of oc- 
currence of specific "triggered" tags is raised 
significantly--with respect o the unigram tag 
probability model. Table 1, taken from (Black 
et al, 1998), provides examples of the tag 
trigger-pair effect. 
Yet, it is one thing to show that extrasenten- 
tial context yields a gain in information with 
respect to a unigram tag probability model. 
But it is another thing to demonstrate that 
extrasentential context supports an improve- 
ment in perplexity vis-a-vis a part-of-speech 
tagging model which employs state-of-the-art 
techniques: such as, for instance, the tag- 
ging model of a maximum entropy tag-n-gram- 
based tagger. 
The present paper undertakes just such a 
demonstration. Both the model underlying 
a standard tag-n-gram-based tagger, and the 
same model augmented with extrasentential 
contextual information, are trMned on the 
850,000-word ATR General English Treebank 
(Black et al, 1996), and then tested on the ac- 
companying 53,000-word test treebank. Perfor- 
mance differences are measured, with the result 
that semantic information from previous sen- 
tences within a document is shown to help sig- 
nificantly in improving the perplexity of tagging

In what follows, Section 2 provides a basic 
overview of the tagging approach used (a max- 
imum entropy tagging model employing con- 
straints equivalent to those of the standard hid- 
den Markov model). Section 3 discusses and 
offers examples of the sorts of extrasententially- 
based semantic onstraints that were added to 
the basic tagging model. Section 4 describes the 
experiments we performed. Section 5 details our 
experimental results. Section 6 glances at pro- 
jected future research, and concludes. 
2 Tagg ing  Mode l  
2.1 ME Mode l  
Our tagging model is a maximum entropy 
(ME) model of the following form: 
K 
P(tlh) = 7 I~ ~ k(h't)p? (1) 
k=0 
where:  
- t is tag we are predicting; 
- h is the history (all prior words and tags) 
of t; 
- 7 is a normalization coefficient hat en- 
~L r-TK \]k(h,t) sures: ~t=oTllk=o ak P0 = 1; 
L is the number of tags in our tag set; 
- ak is the weight of trigger fk; 
fk are trigger functions and f~e{0, 1}; 
- P0 is the default agging model (in our case, 
the uniform distribution, since all of the in- 
formation in the model is specified using 
ME constraints). 
The model we use is similar to that of (Rat- 
naparkhi, 1996). Our baseline model shares the 
following features with this tagging model; we 
will call this set of features the basic n-gram 
tagger constraints: 
1. w=X&t=T 
2. t _ l=X&t=T 
3. t-2t-1 = XY  ~: t = T 
where: 
- w is word whose tag we are predicting; 
- t is tag we are predicting; 
- t-1 is tag to the left of tag t; 
- t-2 is tag to the left of tag t - l ;  
Our baseline model differs from Ratna- 
parkhi's in that it does not use any informa- 
tion about the occurrence of words in the his- 
tory or their properties (other than in con- 
straint 1). Our model exploits the same kind 
of tag-n-gram information that forms the core 
of many successful tagging models, for exam- 
ple, (Kupiec, 1992), (Merialdo, 1994), (Ratna- 
parkhi, 1996). We refer to this type of tagger 
as a tag-n-gram tagger. 
2.2 Tr igger  select ion 
We use mutual information (MI) to select the 
most useful trigger pairs (for more details, see 
(Rosenfeld, 1996)). That is, we use the follow- 
ing formula to gauge a feature's usefulness to 
1-he model: 
MI( , t) 
where: 
= P(,s,t)'tog -?~P(tl~) 
+ P(s,t)"  P(tls) ~og p(~) 
+ P(~,t) log 
+ P(~,/)lo~ P(tl~) c~ p(\[) 
- t is the tag we are predicting; 
- s can be any kind of triggering feature. 
For each of our trigger predictors, s is defined 
below: 
B igram and t r ig ram tr iggers : s is the 
presence of a particular tag as the first tag 
in the bigram pair, or the presence of two 
particular tags (in a particular order) as 
the first two tags of a trigram triple. In 
this case, t is the presence of a particular 
tag in the final position in the n-gram. 
Extrasentential tag t r iggers : 8 is the pres- 
ence of a particular tag in the extrasenten- 
tial history. 
Quest ion  tr iggers : s is the boolean answer 
to a question. 
This method has the advantage of finding 
good candidates quickly, and the disadvantage 
of ignoring any duplication of information in the 
features it selects. A more principled approach 
is to select features by actually adding them 
one-by-one into the ME model (Della Pietra et 
al., 1997); however, using this approach is very 
time-consuming and we decided on the MI ap- 
proach for the sake of speed. 
3 The Constra ints  
To understand what extrasentential semantic 
constraints were added to the base tagging 
model in the current experiments, one needs 
some familiarity with the ATR General En- 
glish Tagset. For detailed presentations, ee 
(Black et al, 1998; Black et al, 1996). An 
apercu can be gained, however, from Figure 
1, which shows two sample sentences from 
the ATR Treebank (and originally from a 
Chinese take-out food flier), tagged with 
respect to the ATR GenerM English Tagset. 
Each verb, noun, adjective and adverb in the 
ATR tagset includes a semantic label, chosen 
from 42 noun/adjective/adverb categories 
and 29 verb/verbal categories, some overlap 
existing between these category sets. Proper 
nouns, plus certain adjectives and certain 
numerical expressions, are further categorized 
via an additional 35 "proper-noun" categories. 
These semantic ategories are intended for any 
"Standard-American-English" text, in any 
domain. Sample categories include: "phys- 
ical.attribute" (nouns/adjectives/adverbs), 
"alter" (verbs/verbals), "interpersonal.act" 
(nouns/adjectives/adverbs/verbs/verbals), 
"orgname" (proper nouns), and "zipcode" 
(numericals). They were developed by the 
ATR grammarian and then proven and refined 
via day-in-day-out tagging for six months at 
ATR by two human "treebankers', then via 
four months of tagset-testing-only work at 
Lancaster University (UK) by five treebankers, 
with daily interactions among treebankers, 
and between the treebankers and the ATR 
grammarian. The semantic ategorization is, 
of course, in addition to an extensive syn- 
tactic classification, involving some 165 basic 
syntactic tags. 
Starting with a basic tag-n-gram tagger 
trained to tag raw text with respect o the ATR 
General English Tagset, then, we added con- 
straints defined in terms of "tag families". A 
tag family is the set of all tags sharing a given 
semantic ategory. For instance, the tag fam- 
ily "MONEY" contains common ouns, proper 
nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, the semantic 
component of whose tags within the ATR Gen- 
eral English Tagset, is "money": 500-stock, De- 
posit, TOLL-FREE, inexpensively, etc. 
One class of constraints consisted of the pres- 
ence, within the 6 sentences (from the same doc- 
ument) 1 preceding the current sentence, of one 
or more instances of a given tag family. This 
type of constraint came in two varieties: ei- 
ther including, or excluding, the words within 
the sentence of the word being tagged. Where 
these intrasentential words were included, they 
1 (Black et al, 1998) determined a 6-sentence window 
to be optimal for this task.

Figure h Two ATR Treebank Sentences from Chinese Take-Out Food Flier (Tagged Only - i.e. 
Parses Not Displayed) 
consisted of the set of words preceding the word 
being tagged, within its sentence. 
A second class of constraints added to the re- 
quirements of the first class the representation, 
within the past 6 sentences, of related tag fam- 
ilies. Boolean combinations of such events de- 
fined this group of constraints. An example is 
as follows: (a) an instance ither of the tag fam- 
ily "person" or of the tag family "personal at- 
tribute"(or both) occurs within the 6 sentences 
preceding the current one; or else (b) an in- 
stance of the  tag family "person" occurs in the 
current sentence, to the left of the word being 
tagged; or, finally, both (a) and (b) occur. 
A third class of constraints had to do with 
the specific word being tagged. In particular, 
the word being classified is required to belong 
to a set of words which have been tagged at 
least once, in the training treebank, with some 
tag from a particular tag family; and which, fur- 
ther, always shared the same basic syntax in the 
training data. For instance, consider the words 
"currency" and "options". Not only have they 
both been tagged at least once in the train- 
ing set with some member of the tag family 
"MONEY" (as well, it happens, as with tags 
from other tag families); but in addition they 
both occur in the training set only as nouns. 
Therefore these two words would occur on a list 
named "MONEY nouns", and when an instance 
of either of these words is being tagged, the con- 
straint "MONEY nouns" is satisfied. 
A fourth and final class of constraints com- 
bines the first or the second class, above, with 
the third class. E.g. it is both the case that 
some avatar of the tag family "MONEY" has 
occurred within the last 6 sentences to the left; 
and that the word being tagged satisfies the 
constraint "MONEY nouns". The advantage 
of this sort Of composite constraint is that it is 
focused, and likely to be'helpful when it does 
occur. The d\[isadvantage is that it is unlikely to 
occur extremely often. On the other hand, con- 
straints of the first, second, and third classes, 
above, are more likely to occur, but less focused 
and therefore less obviously helpful. 
4 The  Exper iments  
4.1 The Four Mode ls  
To evaluate the utility of long-range seman- 
tic context we performed four separate xper- 
iments. All of the models in the experiments 
include the basic ME tag-n-gram tagger con- 
straints listed in section 2. The models used in 
our experiments are as follows: 
(1) The first model is a model consisting ONLY 
of these basic ME tag-n-gram tagger con- 
straints. This model represents the base- 
line model. 
(2) The second model consists of the baseline 
model together with constraints represent- 
ing extrasentential tag triggers. This ex- 
periment measures the effect of employing 
the triggers pecified in (Black et al, 1998) 
--i.e. the presence (or absence) in the pre- 
vious 6 sentences of each tag in the tagset, 
in turn- -  to assist a real tagger, as opposed 
to simply measuring their mutual informa- 
tion. In other words, we are measuring the 
contribution of this long-range information 
over and above a model which uses local 
tag-n-grams as context, rather than mea- 
suring the gain over a naive model which 
does not take context into account, as was 
the case with the mutual information ex- 
periments in (Black et al, 1998). 
(3) The third model consists of the baseline 
model together with the four classes of 
more sophisticated question-based triggers 
defined in the previous section. 
(4) The fourth model consists of the baseline 
model together with both the long-range 
49 
tag trigger constraints and the question- 
based trigger constraints. 
\\:(~ chose the model underlying a standard 
la< n-gram tagger as the baseline because it 
represents a respectable tagging model which 
most readers will be familiar with. The ME 
framework was used to build the models since 
il provides a principled manner in which to inte- 
grate the diverse sources of information needed 
for these experiments. 
4.2 Exper imenta l  Procedure 
The performance of each the tagging models is 
measured on a 53,000-word test treebank hand- 
labelled to an accuracy of over 97% (Black et 
al., 1996; Black et al, 1998). We measure the 
model performance in terms of the perplexity 
of the tag being predicted. This measurement 
gives an indication of how useful the features 
we supply could be to an n-gram tagger when 
it consults its model to obtain a probablity dis- 
tribution over the tagset for a particular word. 
Since our intention is to gauge the usefulness 
of long-range context, we measure the perfor- 
mance improvement with respect to correctly 
(very accurately) labelled context. We chose 
to do this to isolate the effect of the correct 
markup of the history on tagging performance 
(i.e. to measure the performance gain in the ab- 
sence of noise from the tagging process itself). 
Earlier experiments using predicted tags in the 
history showed that at current levels of tagging 
accuracy for this tagset, these predicted tags 
yielded very little benefit to a tagging model. 
However, removing the noise from these tags 
showed clearly that improvement was possible 
from this information. As a consequence, we 
chose to investigate in the absence of noise, so 
that we could see the utility of exploiting the 
history when labelled with syntactic/semantic 
tags. 
The resulting measure is an idealization of a 
component of a real tagging process, and is a 
measure of the usefulness of knowing the tags in 
the history. In order to make the comparisons 
between models fair, we use correctly-labelled 
history in the n-gram components of our mod- 
els as well as for the long-range triggers. As a 
consequence of this, no search is nescessary. 
The number of possible triggers is obviously 
very large and needs to be limited for reasons of

these experiments i shown in Table 2. \[;sing 
these limits we were able to build each model 
in around one week on a 600MHz DEC-alpha. 
The constraints were selected by mutual infor- 
mation. Thus, as an example, the 82425 ques- 
tion trigger constraints hown in Table 2 repre- 
sent the 82425 question trigger constraints with 
the highest mutual information. 
The improved iterative scaling technique 
(Della Pietra et al, 1997) was used to train the 
parameters in the ME model. 
5 The  Resu l ts  
Table 4 shows the perplexity of each of the 
four models on the testset. 
The maximum entropy framework adopted 
for these experiments virtually guarantees that 
models which utilize more information will per- 
form as well as or better than models which do 
not include this extra information. Therefore, 
it comes as no surprise that all models improve 
upon the baseline model, since every model ef- 
fectively includes the baseline model as a com- 
ponent. 
However, despite promising results when 
measuring mutual information gain (Black et 
M., 1998), the baseline model combined only 
with extrasentential tag triggers reduced per- 
plexity by just a modest 7.6% . The explana- 
tion for this is that the information these trig- 
gers provide is already present to some degree 
in the n-grams of the tagger and is therefore 
redundant. 
In spite of this, when long-range information 
is captured using more sophisticated, linguisti- 
cally meaningful questions generated by an ex- 
pert grammarian (as in experiment 3), the per- 
plexity reduction is a more substantial 19.4%.

The explanation for this lies in the fact that 
these question-based triggers are much more 
specific. The simple tag-based triggers will be 
active much more frequently and often inap- 
propriately. The more sophisticated question- 
based triggers are less of a blunt instrument. 
As an example, constraints from the fourth class 
(described in the constraints section of this pa- 
per) are likely to only be active for words able 
to take the particular tag the constraint was 
designed to apply to. In effect, tuning the ME 
constraints has recovered much ground lost to 
the n-grams in the model. 
The final experiment shows that using all.the 
triggers reduces perplexity by 21.4%. This is a 
modest improvement over the results obtained 
in experiment 3. This suggests that even though 
this long-range trigger information is less useful, 
it is still providing some additional information 
to the more sophisticated question-based trig- 
gers. 
Table 3 shows the five constraints with 
the highest mutual information for the tag 
NN1PERSON (singular common noun of per- 
son, e.g. lawyer, friend, niece). All five of these 
constraints happen to fall within the twenty-five 
constraints of any type with the highest mutual 
information with their predicted tags. Within 
Table 3, "full history" refers to the previous 6 
sentences as well as the previous words in the 
current sentence, while "remote history" indi- 
cates only the previous 6 sentences. A "per- 
son word" is any word in the tag family "per- 
son", hence adjectives, adverbs, and both com- 
mon and proper nouns of person. Similarly, a 
"personal attribute word" is any word in the 
tag family "personal attribute", e.g. left-wing, 
liberty, courageously. 
6 Conc lus ion  
Our main concern in this paper has been 
to show that extrasentential nformation can 
provide significant assistance to a real tagger. 
There has been almost no research done in this 
area, possibly due to the fact that, for small 
syntax-only tagsets, very accurate performance 
can be obtained labelling the Wall Street Jour- 
nal corpus using only local context. In the 
experiments presented, we have used a much 
more detailed, semantic and syntactic tagset, on 
which the performance is much lower. Extrasen- 
tential semantic information is needed to disam- 
biguate these tags. We have observed that the 
simple approach of only using the occurrence of
tags in the history as features did not signif- 
icantly improve performance. However, when 
more sophisticated questions are employed to 
mine this long-range contextual information, a 
more significant contribution to performance is 
made. This motivates further research toward 
finding more predictive features. Clearly, the 
work here has only scratched the surface in 
terms of the kinds of questions that it is possi- 
ble to ask of the history. The maximum entropy 
approach that we have adopted is extremely ac- 
commodating in this respect. It is possible to 
51 
go much further in the direction of querying the 
historical tag structure. For example, we can, in 
effect, exploit grammatical relations within pre- 
vious sentences with an eye to predicting the 
tags of similarly related words in the current 
sentence. It is also possible to go even further 
and exploit the structure of full parses in the 
history.
