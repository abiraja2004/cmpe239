Abstract 
This paper describes first steps towards 
extending the METU Turkish Corpus 
from a sentence-level language resource to 
a discourse-level resource by annotating 
its discourse connectives and their 
arguments. The project is based on the 
same principles as the Penn Discourse 
TreeBank (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb) 
and is supported by TUBITAK, The 
Scientific and Technological Research 
Council of Turkey. We first present the 
goals of the project and the METU 
Turkish corpus. We then describe how we 
decided what to take as explicit discourse 
connectives and the range of syntactic 
classes they come from. With 
representative examples of each class, we 
examine explicit connectives, their linear 
ordering, and types of syntactic units that 
can serve as their arguments. We then 
touch upon connectives with respect to 
free word order in Turkish and 
punctuation, as well as the important issue 
of how much material is needed to specify 
an argument. We close with a brief 
discussion of current plans. 
1 Introduction 
The goal of the project is to extend the METU 
Turkish Corpus (Say et al 2002) from a sentence-
level language resource to a discourse-level 
resource by annotating its discourse connectives, 
and their arguments. The 2-million word METU 
Turkish Corpus (MTC) is an electronic resource of 
520 samples of continuous text from 291 different 
sources written between 1990-2000. It includes 
multiple genres, such as novels, short stories, 
newspaper columns, biographies, memoirs, etc. 
annotated topographically, i.e., for paragraph 
boundaries, author, publication date, and the 
source of the text. A small part of the MTC, called 
the METU-Sabanc? TreeBank (5600 sentences) has 
been annotated with morphological features and 
dependency relationships (e.g., modifier-of, 
subject-of, object-of, etc.). The result is a set of 
dependency trees. The MTC as a whole provides a 
large-scale resource on Turkish discourse and is 
being used in research on Turkish. To date, there 
have been 81 requests for permission to use the 
MTC and 31 requests to use the TreeBank sub-
corpus. Most of the users are linguists, computer or 
cognitive scientists working on Turkish, or 
graduate students of similar disciplines. Some 
users have expressed a desire for the MTC to be 
extended by annotations at the discourse level, 
which provides further impetus for the present 
project.  
 The result of annotating discourse connectives 
will be a clearly defined level of discourse 
structure on the MTC. Annotation of text from the 
multiple genres present in the MTC will allow us 
to compare the distribution of connectives and 
their arguments across genres. The annotation will 
help researchers understand Turkish discourse by 
enabling them to give concise, clear descriptions of 
the issues concerning discourse structure and 
semantics, and support a rigorous empirical

characterization of where and how the free word-
order in a language like Turkish is sensitive to 
features of the surrounding discourse. It can thus 
serve as a major resource for natural language 
processing, language technology and pedagogy. 
2 Overview of Turkish Discourse 
Connectives 
From a semantic perspective, a discourse 
connective is a predicate that takes as its 
arguments, abstract objects (propositions, facts, 
events, descriptions, situations, and eventualities). 
The primary linguistic unit in which abstract 
objects (AOs) are realized in Turkish is the clause, 
either tensed or untensed. Discourse connectives 
themselves may be realized explicitly or implicitly. 
An explicit connective is realized in the form of a 
lexical item or a group of lexical items, while an 
implicit connective can be inferred from adjacent 
text spans that realise AOs and whose AOs are 
taken to be related. To constrain the amount of text 
selected for arguments, a minimality principle can 
be imposed, limiting arguments to the minimum 
amount of information needed to complete the 
interpretation of the discourse relation. The project 
will initially focus on annotating explicit 
connectives, integrating implicit ones at a later 
stage.  
One of the most challenging issues so far has 
been determining the set of explicit discourse 
connectives in Turkish (i.e., the various linguistic 
elements that can be interpreted as predicates on 
AO arguments) and the syntactic classes they are 
identified with. In the Penn Discourse TreeBank 
(PDTB), the explicit discourse connectives were 
taken to comprise (1) coordinating conjunctions, 
(2) subordinating conjunctions, and (3) discourse 
adverbials (Forbes-Riley et al 2006). But 
coordinating and subordinating conjunctions are 
not classes in Turkish per se. Moreover, most of 
the existing grammars of Turkish describe clausal 
adjuncts and adverbs in semantic (e.g., temporal, 
additive, resultative, etc.) rather than syntactic 
terms. We therefore made a rough classification 
first and determined the broad syntactic classes by 
considering the morpho-syntactic properties shared 
by elements of the initial classification.  
As a result of this process, we have come to 
identify explicit discourse connectives in Turkish 
with three grammatical types, forming five classes: 
(a) Coordinating conjunctions such as single 
lexical items ??nk? ?because?, ama ?but,? 
ve ?and?, and the particle dA.  (N.B., dA 
can also function as a subordinator.) 
(b) Paired coordinating conjunctions such as 
hem .. hem ?both and,? ne .. ne ?neither 
nor? which link two clauses, with one 
element of the pair associated with each 
clause in the discourse relation. 
(c) Simplex subordinators (also termed as 
converbs), i.e., suffixes forming non-finite 
adverbial clauses, e.g. ?(y)kAn, ?while?, -
(y)ArAk ?by means of?. 
(d) Complex subordinators, i.e., connectives 
which have two parts, usually a 
postposition (ra?men ?despite?, i?in ?for?, 
gibi ?as well as?) and an accompanying 
suffix on the (non-finite) verb of the 
subordinate clause.1  
(e)  Anaphoric connectives such as ne var ki 
?however?, ?stelik ?what is more?, ayr?ca 
?apart from this?, ilk olarak ?firstly?, etc. 
In the PDTB, non-finite clauses have not been 
annotated as arguments. However, since all non-
finite clauses are marked with a suffix in Turkish 
(see sections 4.1 and 4.2 below) and encode a 
relation between AOs, we would have missed an 
important property of the language if we had not 
identified them as discourse connectives (cf. 
Prasad et al, 2008).  
All the discourse connectives above have 
exactly two arguments. So as in English, while 
verbs in Turkish can vary in the number of 
arguments they take, Turkish discourse 
connectives take two and only two arguments. 
These can conveniently be called ARG1 and 
ARG2. It remains an open question whether there 
is any language in which discourse connectives 
take more than two arguments. 
In the following, we give representative 
examples of each of the above five classes of 
discourse connectives and discuss the assignment 
of the argument labels, linear order of arguments 
and types of arguments. By convention, we label

 Postpositions correspond to prepositions in English, though 
there are many fewer of them. They form a subordinate clause 
by nominalizing their complements and marking them with 
the dative, ablative, or the possessive case. In the examples 
given in this paper, suffixes are shown in upper-case letters. 
Case suffixes are underlined in addition to being presented in 
upper-case letters.

the argument containing (or with an affinity for) 
the connective as ARG2 (presented in boldface) 
and the other argument as ARG1 (presented in 
italics). Discourse connectives are underlined. This 
annotation convention is used in the English 
translations as well. Except for examples (12), 
(13), (19), (20), all examples have been taken from 
the MTC.  
3 Coordinating conjunctions 
3.1 Simple coordinating conjunctions 
Coordinating conjunctions are like English and 
combine two clauses of the same syntactic type, 
e.g., two main clauses. They are typically 
sentence-medial and show an affinity with the 
second clause (evidenced in part through 
punctuation and their ability to move to the end of 
the second clause). Whether a coordinating 
conjunction links clauses within a single sentence 
or clauses across adjacent sentences (cf. Section 6), 
it shows an affinity with the second clause. Thus 
ARG2 of these conjunctions is the second clause 
and ARG1 is the first clause.  
 
(1) Yap?lar?n? kerpi?ten yap?yorlar, ama sonra ta?? 
kullanmay? ??reniyorlar. Mimarl?k a??s?ndan ?ok 
?nemli, ??nk? bu yap? malzemesini ba?ka bir 
malzemeyle beraber kullanmay?, ilk defa 
burada g?r?yoruz. 
 
?They constructed their buildings first from mud-
bricks but then they learnt to use the stone. 
Architecturally, this is very important because we 
see the use of this construction material with 
another one at this site for the first time.?  
 
    The particle dA can serve a discourse 
connective function with an additive (Example 2) 
or adversative sense (Example 3). In contrast with 
coordinating conjunctions, the order of arguments 
to dA is normally ARG2-ARG1, thus exhibiting a 
similarity with subordinators (see below). 
However, since dA combines two clauses of the 
same syntactic type, we take it to be a simple 
coordinating conjunction.  
 
(2) Konu?may? unuttum diyorum da g?l?yorlar 
bana.   
 ?I said I?ve forgotton to talk and they laughed at 
me.? 
(3) Belki bir ?ocu?umuz olsa onunla oyalan?rd?m 
da  Allah k?smet etmedi. 
 ?If we had a child I would keep myself busy 
with her/him but God did not predestine it.?  
3.2 Paired coordinating conjunctions 
Paired coordinating conjunctions are composed of 
two lexical items, with the second often a duplicate 
of the first element. These lexical items express a 
single discourse relation, such as disjunction as in 
example (4). The order of arguments is ARG1-
ARG2 and the position of the conjunctions is 
clause-initial. 
    
(4) Birilerinin ya i?i vard?r, aceleyle y?r?rler, ya 
ko?arlar. 
 ?Some people are either busy and walk hurriedly, 
or they run.?  
4 Subordinators 
4.1 Simplex subordinators 
When a subordinate clause is reduced in Turkish, it 
loses its tense, aspect and mood properties. In this 
way, it becomes a nominal or adverbial clause 
associated with the matrix verb. The relationship of 
an adverbial clause with the AO expressed by the 
matrix verb and its arguments is conveyed by a 
small set of suffixes corresponding to English 
?while?, ?when?, ?by means of?, ?as if?, or  temporal 
?since?, added to the non-finite verb of the reduced 
clause. This pair of non-finite verb and suffix, we 
call a ?converb?. The normal order of the 
arguments of a converb is ARG2-ARG1, where the 
converb appears as the last element of ARG2. The 
following example illustrates ?(y)ArAk ?by means 
of? and its arguments: 
 
(5) Kafiye Han?m beni kucaklad?, yana??n? yana??ma 
s?rterek iyi yolculuklar diledi. 
 ?Kafiye hugged me and by rubbing her cheek 
against mine, she wished me a good trip.?  
4.2 Complex subordinators 
Complex subordinators constitute a larger set than 
the set of simplex subordinators. Here, a lexical 
item, usually a postposition, must appear with a 
nominalizing suffix and, if required, a case suffix 
as well. If the verb of the clause does not have a 
subject, it is nominalized with ?mAk (the infinitive 
suffix). If  it has a subject, it is nominalized with -
DIK (past) or ?mA (non-past) and carries the 
possessive marker agreeing with the subject of the 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
67
verb. The normal order of the arguments of a 
complex subordinator is the same as with 
converbs, i.e., ARG2-ARG1. The nominalizer, the 
possessive and the case suffix (if any) appear 
attached to the non-finite verb of ARG2 in that 
order. The connective appears as the last element 
of ARG2.  
Some postpositions have multiple senses, 
depending on the type of nominalizer attached to 
the non-finite verb. For example, the postposition 
i?in means causal ?since? with ?DIK (Example 6), 
and ?so as to? with ?mA or ?mAk (Example 7). In 
these examples, the lexical part of the complex 
subordinator is underlined, and the suffixes on the 
non-finite verb of ARG2 rendered in small caps.  
 
(6) Herkes ?oktan pazara ??kTI?I i?in kentin o dar,       
e?ri b??r? arka sokaklar?n? bo?alm?? ve sessiz 
bulurduk. 
 ?Since everyone has gone to the bazaar long 
time ago, we would find the narrow and curved 
back streets of the town empty and quiet.?  
(7) [Turhan Baytop] Paris Eczac?l?k Fak?ltesi 
Farmakognozi k?rs?s?nde g?rg? ve bilgisini 
artt?rMAK i?in ?al??m??t?r. 
 ?Turhan Baytop worked at Paris Pharmacology 
Faculty so as to increase his experience and 
knowledge,?  
 
Since postpositions also have a non-discourse 
role in which they signal a verb?s arguments and/or 
adjuncts, we will only annotate postpositions as 
discourse connectives when they have clausal 
elements as arguments. Given that a clausal 
element always has a nominalizing suffix, the 
distinction will be straightforward. For example, in 
(8) i?in takes an NP complement (marked with the 
possessive case) and will not be annotated, while 
in (9) ra?men  ?despite? comes with a nominalizer 
and the dative suffix, and it will be annotated: 
 
(8) Bunun i?in paraya ihtiyac?m?z var. 
 ?We need money for this.? 
(9) ?ok iyi bir bi?imde yay?lm?? olMASINA                 
ra?men Celtis (?itlenbik) poleninin yoklu?u 
dikkate de?erdir. 
 ?Despite not dispersing well, the absence of the 
Celtis [tree] polen is worthy of attention.? 
 
In general, both parts of a complex subordinator 
must be realized in the discourse. An exception is 
?if? e?er and its accompanying suffix ?sE (and the 
marker agreeing with the subject of the subordinate 
clause where necessary). The suffix suffices to 
introduce a discourse relation on its own, even 
without the postposition e?er:  
 
(10) Salman Rushdi ?ld?r?l?rSE ?slam dini bundan 
bir onur mu kazanacak? 
 ?If Salman Rushdi was to be killed, would the 
Islam religion be honoured??  
(11) E?er sigaray? b?rakmak i?in m?kemmel 
zaman? bekliyorSAn?z asla sigaray? 
b?rakamazs?n?z. 
 ?If you are waiting for the best time to stop 
smoking, you can never stop smoking?  
5 Anaphoric connectives 
The fifth type of explicit discourse connectives are 
anaphoric connectives. Anaphoric connectives are 
distinguished from clausal adverbs like ?o?unlukla 
?usually?, mutlaka ?definitely, maalesef 
?regrettably?, which are interpreted only with 
respect to their matrix sentence. In contrast, 
anaphoric connectives also require an AO from a 
sentence or group of sentences adjacent (Example 
12) or non-adjacent (Example 13) to the sentence 
containing the connective. Another important 
property of anaphoric connectives is that they can 
access the inferences in the prior discourse 
(Webber et al2003). This material is neither 
accessible by other types of discourse connectives 
nor clausal connectives.  For example, in example 
(14), the anaphoric connective yoksa ?or else, 
otherwise? accesses the inference that the 
organizations have not united and hence did not 
introduce political strategies unique to Turkey.  
 
(12) Ali hi? spor yapmaz. Sonu? olarak ?ok istedi?i   
halde kilo veremiyor. 
 ?Ali never exercises. Consequently, he can?t lose 
weight although he wants to very much.? 
(13) Zeynep ?nceleri Bodrum?da oturdu. Krediyle 
deniz kenar?nda bir ev ald?. Evi dayad?, d??edi, 
bah?eye yasemin ekti. Ne var ki banka kredisini 
?deyemedi?inden evi satmak zorunda kald?.  
 ?Zeynep first lived in Mersin. She bought a house 
by the sea on credit. She furnished it fully and 
planted jasmine in the garden. However, she had 
to sell the house because she couldn?t pay back 
the credit.?

(14) Bu ?rg?tlerin birle?erek T?rkiye?yi etkilemesi ve 
T?rkiye?ye ?zg? politikalar? g?ndeme getirmesi 
laz?m.  Yoksa Tony Blair ??yle yapt? ?imdi biz 
de ?imdi b?yle yapaca??zla olmaz. 
 ?These organizations must unite, have an impact 
on Turkey and introduce political strategies 
unique to Turkey. Or else talking about what 
Tony Blair did and hoping to do what he did is 
outright wrong.? 
6 Ordering flexibility of explicit discourse 
connectives and their arguments 
In Turkish, the linear ordering of coordinating 
conjunctions and subordinators and the clauses in 
which they occur shows some flexibility as to 
where in the clause they appear or as to the 
ordering of the clauses. For example, coordinating 
conjunctions may appear at the beginning of their 
ARG2, i.e. S-initially. This was shown earlier in 
Example (1). The sentences below illustrate ama 
?but? and ??nk? ?because? used at this position.  
 
(15) Hatem A?a?n?n mal?na kimse yana?amaz, 
dokunamazd?. Ama Osman gitmi?, Hatem 
A?a?n?n ?iftli?ini yakm??t?. 
 ?No one could approach and touch Agha 
Hatem?s property. But Osman had burnt Agha 
Hatem?s ranch.? 
(16) S?z ?zg?rl???n?n belli yasalar, belli ilkeler 
?er?evesinde kalmak zorunda oldu?unu 
biliyoruz. ??nk?, b?t?n ?zg?rl?kler gibi, belli 
s?n?rlar a??l?nca, ba?kalar?na zarar vermek, 
ba?kalar?n?n ?zg?rl?klerini zedelemek s?z 
konusu oluyor.  
 ?We know that freedom of speech should remain 
within the limits of certain laws and principles. 
Because, like all the other freedoms, when 
certain constraints are violated, one may 
harm others? freedom.? 
  
But coordinating conjunctions may also appear at 
the end of their ARG2 and so will appear S-finally 
in sentences with ARG1-ARG2 order. Below, we 
illustrate two cases of ama ?but? and ??nk? 
?because?.    
 
(17) Kaz?yabildi?ini sildi, biriktirdi mendilinin i?ine. 
?aba isteyen zor bir i?ti bu yapt??? ama. 
 ?He wiped the area he had scraped and saved all 
he could scrape in his rag. But what he was 
doing was a difficult job, requiring effort.? 
(18) Kimi m??teriler dore rengi kuma?larla, sar? 
taftalarla gelirdi de, elim dolu yapamam, diye 
geri ?evirirdi, pek anlam veremezdim. Paray? 
severdi ??nk?. 
 ?Some customers would come with gold coloured 
fabrics and yellow taffeta weaves but he would 
reject them saying his hands were full, which I 
could not give any meaning to. Because he loved 
money.?  
 
In contrast, the position of a subordinator (both 
simplex and complex) in its ARG2 clause is fixed: 
it must appear at the end of the clause, as shown in 
example (19). However, the clause is free in the 
sentence and may be moved to the right of the 
sentence, as in example (20). It is a matter of 
empirical research to find out whether different 
genres vary more in how clauses are ordered and 
what motivates preposing of ARG1. 
 
(19) Ay?e konu?urken ben dinlemiyordum. 
 ?I was not listening while Ay?e was talking.? 
(20) Ben dinlemiyordum Ay?e konu?urken. 
 ?I was not listening while Ay?e was talking.? 
7 Issues and plans 
As mentioned above, we also plan to annotate 
implicit connectives between adjacent sentences or 
clauses whose relation is not explicitly marked 
with a discourse connective. This we will do at a 
later stage, after explicit connectives have been 
annotated, following the procedure used in 
annotating implicit connectives in the PDTB 
(PDTB-Group, 2006). Preliminary analysis has 
shown that punctuation serves as a useful hint in 
inserting a coordinating conjunctions such as ?and? 
or an anaphoric connective such as ?then? or 
?consequently? between the multiple adjacent main 
clauses that can occur in a Turkish sentence 
separated by a comma. Example (21) illustrates 
these cases. 
 
(21) Y?r?yor, Imp = THEN oturuyor, resim yapmaya 
?al???yor ama yapam?yor, tabela yazmaya 
?al???yor ama yazam?yor, Imp= CONSEQUENTLY 
s?k?l?p soka?a ??k?yor, Imp=AND bisikletine 
atlad??? gibi pedallara bas?yor. 
 ?He walks around, then sits down and tries to 
draw, but he can?t. He tries to inscribe words on 
the wooden plaque, but again he can?t. 
Consequently he gets bored, goes out, and hops 
on his bike and pedals.?

A second important issue that will have to be 
tackled in the project is determining how much 
material is needed to specify the argument of a 
discourse connective. Annotation will be on text 
spans, rather than on syntactic structure. This 
reflects two facts: First, there is only a small 
amount of syntactically treebanked data in the 
MTC, and secondly, as has been discovered for 
English, one can not assume that discourse units 
map directly to syntactic units (Dinesh et al 2005). 
Preliminary analysis also shows that discourse 
units may not coincide with a clause in its entirety. 
For example, in examples (9) and (16), one can 
take ARG1 to cover only the nominal complement 
of the matrix verb: The rest of the clause is not 
necessary to the discourse relation. The ways in 
which the arguments of a discourse connective 
may diverge from syntactic units must be 
characterized for Turkish as is being done for 
English (Dinesh et al 2005). 
A third issue we will investigate is whether 
different senses of a subordinator may be identified 
simply from the type of nominalizing suffix 
required on the subordinate verb. For example, we 
have noted in examples (6) and (7) that the two 
senses of the postposition i?in (namely, ?since 
(causal)? and ?in order to?) are disambiguated by 
the nominalizing suffixes. The extent to which 
morphology aids sense disambiguation is an 
empirical issue that will be further addressed in the 
project.
