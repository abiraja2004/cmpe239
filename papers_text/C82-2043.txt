French to Russian automatic translation system be lng  de- 
veloped In All-Unlon Centre of Translation is conceived as 
part of a multlfunctlonal information processing system in 
the sense that It should be able to use approaches and methods 
proper to the information processing field, such as summariz- 
ing, abstracting, indexing, making inferences, etc. In such a 
system translation is realized through building text informat- 
ion representation (IR). The task requires two types of ana- 
lysis: linguistic analysis (LA) and information analysis (IA) 
working in interaction, the latter being, in particular, able 
to refer to the automatic thesaurus. The ultimate aim of LA is 
the building of sentence semantic representation (SR). It is 
important that for each individual sentence its SR Is con- 
\ s t ruc ted  as a function of the IR of the whole text. (The cur- 
rent version of the system does not operate with the whole 
text but is limited for each sentence with Its more or less 
immediate context.) Linguistic analysis calculates morpholog- 
ical structure for words, syntactic and semantic structures 
for sentences. Each of these structures is determined by the 
approprlete language realities; still remaining obscurities 
can be cleared only by referring to higher levels of analysis. 
SR built for an lndlvlduel sentence without regard to other 
sentences" SR's is normally incomplete (deficient, ambiguous I 
incorrect, etc.). SR incompleteness Is manifested by incomplet- 
- 178  - 
eness of its units? The construction of text IR requires 
operations of comparison of different SR units as well as 
their comparison with thesaurus units. As a rule, incomplet- 
eness proper to SR's As cleared onl~ partially, which calls 
for some external measures to ensure a formally correct struct- 
ure ready for the synthesis of the output text. The general 
scheme of the system functioning runs as follows: 
1 ? analysis 2. reconstruc t- 3 ? summarlz- 4 ? synthesis 
(LA) ion (LA-IA) Ing (IA) 
lnl~tIal r SR corrected SR compressed SR 
input output  
sent  eric e sent  ence  
L l r~u is t l c  ana lys i s  conta ins  a se t  o f  p rocedures  aimed 
at creating initial S~'s where all cases of Incompleteness 
are exposed. Reconstruction compares SR's with each other and 
with the thesaurus and restaures the missing parts of S~'s. 
Summarizing means obtaining a klnd of an abstract from which 
all obscure and Incomplete parts are removed so that only 
essential Information Is available. 
Information processing plays an important role in ~ealle- 
ation of the scheme as the system translates only what it 
comprehends, thus the result may be called not a literal but 
a "digested" translation. The information model of automatic 
translation is based on the properties of the coherent text. 
One of the main properties Is that pieces of information 
essential for the text are repeated there In many ways and by 
various iIngulstlc means. IA alms at Identifying such infor- 
mation and making it the basis for SR reconstruction. The le- 
vel of "information noise" in the synthesized text Is expected 
to be lower than In the classical approach to AT (sentence-to- 
-sentence translation through syntactic structures). The 
degree of abstracting (summarizing) can vary depending On the 
purpose: the system can be oriented at getting a translation
