Abstract
Twitter has been shown to be a fast and reli-
able method for disease surveillance of com-
mon illnesses like influenza. However, previ-
ous work has relied on simple content anal-
ysis, which conflates flu tweets that report
infection with those that express concerned
awareness of the flu. By discriminating these
categories, as well as tweets about the authors
versus about others, we demonstrate signifi-
cant improvements on influenza surveillance
using Twitter.
1 Introduction
Twitter is a fantastic data resource for many tasks:
measuring political (O?Connor et al, 2010; Tumas-
jan et al, 2010), and general sentiment (Bollen et
al., 2011), studying linguistic variation (Eisenstein
et al, 2010) and detecting earthquakes (Sakaki et
al., 2010). Similarly, Twitter has proven useful for
public health applications (Dredze, 2012), primar-
ily disease surveillance (Collier, 2012; Signorini et
al., 2011), whereby public health officials track in-
fection rates of common diseases. Standard govern-
ment data sources take weeks while Twitter provides
an immediate population measure.
Strategies for Twitter influenza surveillance in-
clude supervised classification (Culotta, 2010b; Cu-
lotta, 2010a; Eiji Aramaki and Morita, 2011), un-
supervised models for disease discovery (Paul and
Dredze, 2011), keyword counting1, tracking geo-
graphic illness propagation (Sadilek et al, 2012b),
and combining tweet contents with the social net-
work (Sadilek et al, 2012a) and location informa-

tion (Asta and Shalizi, 2012). All of these methods
rely on a relatively simple NLP approach to analyz-
ing the tweet content, i.e. n-gram models for classi-
fying related or not related to the flu. Yet examining
flu tweets yields a more complex picture:
? going over to a friends house to check on her son.
he has the flu and i am worried about him
? Starting to get worried about swine flu...
Both are related to the flu and express worry, but
tell a different story. The first reports an infec-
tion of another person, while the second expresses
the author?s concerned awareness. While infection
tweets indicate a rise in infection rate, awareness
tweets may not. Automatically making these dis-
tinctions may improve influenza surveillance, yet re-
quires more than keywords.
We present an approach for differentiating be-
tween flu infection and concerned awareness tweets,
as well as self vs other, by relying on a deeper analy-
sis of the tweet. We present our features and demon-
strate improvements in influenza surveillance.
1.1 Related Work
Much of the early work on web-based influenza
surveillance relied on query logs and click-through
data from search engines (Eysenbach, 2006), most
famously Google?s Flu Trends service (Ginsberg et
al., 2008; Cook et al, 2011). Other sources of in-
formation include articles from the news media and
online mailing lists (Brownstein et al, 2010).
2 Capturing Nuanced Trends
Previous work has classified messages as being re-
lated or not related to influenza, with promising
surveillance results, but has ignored nuanced differ-
ences between flu tweets. Tweets that are related to
789
flu but do not report an infection can corrupt infec-
tion tracking.
Concerned Awareness vs. Infection (A/I) Many
flu tweets express a concerned awareness as opposed
to infection, including fear of getting the flu, an
awareness of increased infections, beliefs related to
flu infection, and preventative flu measures (e.g. flu
shots.) Critically, these people do not seem to have
the flu, whereas infection tweets report having the
flu. This distinction is similar to modality (Prab-
hakaran et al, 2012a). Conflating these tweets can
hurt surveillance, as around half of our annotated
flu messages were awareness. Identifying awareness
tweets may be of use in-and-of itself, such as for
characterizing fear of illness (Epstein et al, 2008;
Epstein, 2009), public perception, and discerning
sentiment (e.g. flu is negative, flu shots may be pos-
itive.) We focus on surveillance improvements.2
Self vs. Other (S/O) Tweets for both awareness
and infection can describe the author (self) or oth-
ers. It may be that self infection reporting is more
informative. We test this hypothesis by classifying
tweets as self vs. other.
Finding Flu Related Tweets (R/U) We must first
identify messages that are flu related. We construct
a classifier for flu related vs. unrelated.
3 Features
Token sequences (n-grams) are an insufficient fea-
ture set, since our classes share common vocabular-
ies. Consider,
? A little worried about the swine flu epidemic!
? Robbie might have swine flu. I?m worried.
Both tweets mention flu and worried, which distin-
guish them as flu related but not specifically aware-
ness or infection, nor self or other. Motivated by
Bergsma et al (2012), we complement 3-grams with
additional features that capture longer spans of text
and generalize using part of speech tags. We begin
by processing each tweet using the ARK POS tag-
ger (Gimpel et al, 2011) and find phrase segmen-
tations using punctuation tags.3 Most phrases were
two (31.2%) or three (26.6%) tokens long.
2While tweets can both show awareness and report an in-
fection, we formulate a binary task for simplicity since only a
small percentage of tweets were so labeled.
3We used whitespace for tokenization, which did about the
same as Jerboa (Van Durme, 2012).

Table 1: Our manually created set of word class features.
Word Classes For our task, many word types can
behave similarly with regard to the label. We create
word lists for possessive words, flu related words,
fear related words, ?self? words, ?other? words, and
fear words (Table 1). A word?s presence triggers a
count-based feature corresponding to each list.
Stylometry We include Twitter-specific style fea-
tures. A feature is included for retweet, hashtags,
and mentions of other users. We include a feature
for emoticons (based on the emoticon part-of-speech
tag). We include a more specific feature for positive
emoticons (:) :D :)). We also include a feature
for negative emoticons (:( :/). Additionally, we
include a feature for links to URLs.
Part of Speech Templates We include features
based on a number of templates matching specific
sequences of words, word classes, and part of speech
tags. Where any word included in the template
matches a word in one of the word classes, an ad-
ditional feature is included indicating that the word
class was included in that template.
? Tuples of (subject,verb,object) and pairs of (sub-
ject, verb), (subject, object), and (verb, object). We
use a simple rule to construct these tuples: the first
noun or pronoun is taken as the subject, and the first
verb appearing after the subject is taken as the verb.
The object is taken as any noun or pronoun that ap-
pears before a verb or at the end of a phrase.
790
? A pairing of the first pronoun with last noun.
These are useful for S/O, e.g. I am worried that my
son has the flu to recognize the difference between
the author (I) and someone else.
? Phrases that begin with a verb (pro-drop). This is
helpful for S/O, e.g. getting the flu! which can indi-
cate self even without a self-related pronoun. An ad-
ditional feature is included if this verb is past-tense.
? Numeric references. These often indicate aware-
ness (number of people with the flu) and are gen-
erally not detected by an n-gram model. We add a
separate feature if the word following has the root
?died?, e.g. So many people dying from the flu, I?m
scared!
? Pair of first pronoun/noun with last verb in a
phrase. Many phrases have multiple verbs, but the
last verb is critical, e.g. I had feared the flu. Ad-
ditional features are added if the noun/pronoun is in
the ?self? or ?other? word class, and if the verb is in
the ?possessive? word class.
? Flu appears as a noun before first verb in a phrase.
This indicates when flu is a subject, which is more
likely to be about awareness.
? Pair of verb and following noun. This indicates the
verbs object, which can change the focus of A/I,
e.g., I am getting a serious case of the flu vs. I am
getting a flu shot. Additional features are added if
the verb is past tense (based on word list and suffix
?-ed?.)
? Whether a flu related word appears as a noun or
an adjective. When flu is used as an adjective, it
may indicate a more general discussion of the flu,
as opposed to an actual infection I hate this flu vs. I
hate this flu hype.
? If a proper noun is followed by a possessive verb.
This may indicate others for the S/O task Looks like
Denmark has the flu. An additional feature fires for
any verb that follows a proper noun and any past
tense verb that follows a proper noun.
? Pair each noun with ???. While infection tweets
are often statements and awareness questions, the
subject matters, e.g. Do you think that swine flu
is coming to America? as awareness. An equivalent
feature is included for phrases ending with ?!?.
While many of our features can be extracted using
a syntactic parser (Foster et al, 2011), tweets are
very short, so our simple rules and over-generating
features captures the desired effects without parsing.
Self Other Total
Awareness 23.15% 24.07% 47.22%
Infection 37.21% 15.57% 52.78%
Total 60.36% 39.64%
Table 2: The distribution over labels of the data set. In-
fection tweets are more likely to be about the author (self)
than those expressing awareness.
3.1 Learning
We used a log-linear model from Mallet (McCal-
lum, 2002) with L2 regularization. For each task, we
first labeled tweets as related/not-related and then
classified the related tweets as awareness/infection
and self/others. We found this two phase approach
worked better than multi-class.
4 Data Collection
We used two Twitter data sets: a collection of 2
billion tweets from May 2009 and October 2010
(O?Connor et al, 2010)4 and 1.8 billion tweets col-
lected from August 2011 to November 2012. To
obtain labeled data, we first filtered the data sets
for messages containing words related to concern
and influenza,5 and used Amazon Mechanical Turk
(Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010) to label tweets
as concerned awareness, infection, media and un-
related. We allowed multiple categories per tweet.
Annotators also labeled awareness/infection tweets
as self, other or both. We included tweets we anno-
tated to measure Turker quality and obtained three
annotations per tweet. More details can be found in
Lamb et al (2012).
To construct a labeled data set we removed low
quality annotators (below 80% accuracy on gold
tweets.) This seemed like a difficult task for anno-
tators as a fifth of the data had no annotations after
this step. We used the majority label as truth and ties
were broken using the remaining low quality anno-
tators. We then hand-corrected all tweets, changing
13.5% of the labels. The resulting data set contained
11,990 tweets (Table 2), 5,990 from 2011-2012 for
training and the remaining from 2009-2010 as test.6
4This coincided with the second and larger H1N1 (swine
flu) outbreak of 2009; swine flu is mentioned in 39.6% of the
annotated awareness or infection tweets.
5e.g. ?flu?, ?worried?, ?worry?, ?scared?, ?scare?, etc.
6All development was done using cross-validation on train-
ing data, reserving test data for the final experiments.

5 Experiments
We begin by evaluating the accuracy on the bi-
nary classification tasks and then measure the re-
sults from the classifiers for influenza surveillance.
We created precision recall curves on the test data
(Figure 1), and measured the highest F1, for the
three binary classifiers. For A/I and S/O, our addi-
tional features improved over the n-gram baselines.
We performed feature ablation experiments (Table
3) and found that for A/I, the word class features
helped the most by a large margin, while for S/O
the stylometry and pro-drop features were the most
important after n-grams. Interestingly, S/O does
equally well removing just n-gram features, sug-
gesting that the S/O task depends on a few words
captured by our features.
Since live data will have classifiers run in stages
? to filter out not-related tweets ? we evaluated
the performance of two-staged classification. F1
dropped to 0.7250 for A/I and S/O dropped to
0.8028.
5.1 Influenza surveillance using Twitter
We demonstrate how our classifiers can improve in-
fluenza surveillance using Twitter. Our hypothesis
is that by isolating infection tweets we can improve
correlations against government influenza data. We
include several baseline methods:
Google Flu Trends: Trends from search queries.7
Keywords: Tweets that contained keywords from
the DHHS Twitter surveillance competition.
ATAM: We obtained 1.6 million tweets that were
automatically labeled as influenza/other by ATAM

(Paul and Dredze, 2011). We trained a binary classi-
fier with n-grams and marked tweets as flu infection.
We evaluated three trends using our three binary
classifiers trained with a reduced feature set close to
the n-gram features:8
All Flu: Tweets marked as flu by Keywords or
ATAM were then classified as related/unrelated.9
This trend used all flu-related tweets.
Infection: Related tweets were classified as either
awareness or infection. This used infection tweets.
Infection+Self: Infection were then labeled as self
or other. This trend used self tweets.
All five of these trends were correlated against
data from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) weekly estimates of influenza-like
illness (ILI) in the U.S., with Pearson correlations
computed separately for 2009 and 2011 (Table 4).10
Previous work has shown high correlations for 2009
data, but since swine flu had so dominated social me-
dia, we expect weaker correlations for 2011.
Results are show in Table 4 and Figure 2 shows
two classifiers against the CDC ILI data. We see
that in 2009 the Infection curve fits the CDC curve
very closely, while the All Flu curve appears to
substantially overestimate the flu rate at the peak.
While 2009 is clearly easier, and all trends have
similar correlations, our Infection classifier beats the
other Twitter methods. All trends do much worse in
8Classifiers trained on 2011 data and thresholds selected to
maximize F1 on held out 2009 data.
9Since our data set to train related or unrelated focused on
tweets that appeared to mention the flu, we first filtered out ob-
vious non-flu tweets by running ATAM and Keywords.
10While the 2009 data is a 10% sample of Twitter, we used a
different approach for 2011. To increase the amount of data, we
collected Tweets mentioning health keywords and then normal-
ized by the public stream counts. For our analysis, we excluded
days that were missing data. Additionally, we used a geolocator
based on user provided locations to exclude non-US messages.
See (Dredze et al, 2013) for details and code for the geolocator.

between the two years due to differences in data collection, but we note that the 2011-12 season was much milder.
the 2011 season, which was much milder and thus
harder to detect. Of the Twitter methods, those us-
ing our system were dramatically higher, with the
Infection curve doing the best by a significant mar-
gin. Separating out infection from awareness (A/I)
led to significant improvements, while the S/O clas-
sifier did not, for unknown reasons.
The best result using Twitter reported to date has
been by Doan et al (2012), whose best system had
a correlation of 0.9846 during the weeks beginning
8/30/09?05/02/10. Our Infection system had a cor-
relation of 0.9887 during the same period. While
Google does better than any of the Twitter systems,
we note that Google has access to much more (pro-
prietary) data, and their system is trained to predict
CDC trends, whereas our Twitter system is intrinsi-
cally trained only on the tweets themselves.
Finally, we are also interested in daily trends in
addition to weekly, but there is no available evalu-
ation data on this scale. Instead, we computed the
stability of each curve, by measuring the day-to-day
changes. In the 2009 season, the relative increase
or decrease from the previous day had a variance of
3.0% under the Infection curve, compared to 4.1%
under ATAM and 6.7% under Keywords.
6 Discussion
Previous papers have implicitly assumed that flu-
related tweets mimick the infection rate. While this
was plausible on 2009 data that focused on the swine
flu epidemic, it is clearly false for more typical flu
seasons. Our results show that by differentiating be-
tween types of flu tweets to isolate reports of infec-
tion, we can recover reasonable surveillance. This
result delivers a promising message for the NLP
community: deeper content analysis of tweets mat-
ters. We believe this conclusion is applicable to nu-
merous Twitter trend tasks, and we encourage others
to investigate richer content analyses for these tasks.
In particular, the community interested in modeling
author beliefs and influence (Diab et al, 2009; Prab-
hakaran et al, 2012b; Biran and Rambow, 2011)
may find our task and data of interest. Finally, be-
yond surveillance, our methods can be used to study
disease awareness and sentiment, which has impli-
cations for how public health officials respond to
outbreaks. We conclude with an example of this dis-
tinction. On June 11th, 2009, the World Health Or-
ganization declared that the swine flu had become a
global flu pandemic. On that day, flu awareness in-
creased 282%, while infections increased only 53%.
