Abstract 
Recent studies into Web retrieval have 
shown that word sense disambiguation 
can increase retrieval effectiveness. How-
ever, it remains unclear as to the mini-
mum disambiguation accuracy required 
and the granularity with which one must 
define word sense in order to maximize 
these benefits. This study answers these 
questions using a simulation of the effects 
of ambiguity on information retrieval. It 
goes beyond previous studies by differen-
tiating between homonymy and 
polysemy. Results show that retrieval is 
more sensitive to polysemy than ho-
monymy and that, when resolving 
polysemy, accuracy as low as 55% can 
potentially lead to increased performance. 
1 Introduction 
Lexical ambiguity refers to words that share the 
same orthography but have different meanings 
(word senses). It can be sub-divided into two dis-
tinct types, homonymy and polysemy. Homonymy 
describes when two senses of a given word (or 
derivation) are distinct. Typically, they are sepa-
rated by etymology and are therefore entirely unre-
lated in meaning. One classic example (Kilgarriff, 
1992) is ?bat? as in an airborne mammal (from the 
Middle English word ?bakke? meaning flying ro-
dent) vs. ?bat? as in an instrument used in the game 
of cricket (from the Celtic for stick or cudgel). 
There is no underlying relationship between these 
two meanings which have come about independ-
ently from differing root languages. Alternatively, 
polysemy describes where two senses of a word 
are related in that they share membership of a sub-
suming semantic classification. Consider the word 
?mouth? as in a part of the body vs. ?mouth? as in 
the outlet of a river. Both meanings are subsumed 
by a higher concept (in this case they both describe 
an opening). Homonymy and polysemy are differ-
entiated in most dictionaries by the major (homo-
nyms) and minor (polysemes) entries for a given 
word. Where a lexical resource is described in 
terms of granularity a coarse-grained approach 
only differentiates between homonymy whereas a 
fine-grained approach also considers polysemy. 
The use of word sense disambiguation in In-
formation Retrieval (IR) has been an active field of 
study for the past 30 years. Despite several failures 
(described in Sanderson, 2000) recent studies have 
begun to show increased retrieval effectiveness, 
particularly in Web retrieval. However, two key 
questions remain: (1) to what accuracy must dis-
ambiguation be performed in order to show in-
creased retrieval effectiveness and (2) to what level 
of granularity should disambiguation be performed 
in order to maximize these gains? This study an-
swers these questions by simulating the impact of 
ambiguity and its subsequent resolution on re-
trieval effectiveness. 
2 Related Work 
The motivation for this research is taken from re-
cent studies (section 2.1) which have demonstrated 
increased retrieval effectiveness by accounting for 
word sense. The methodology is derived from pre-
vious studies (section 2.2) which model the impact 
that ambiguity and its subsequent resolution have 
on IR. 
403
2.1 Accounting for Sense in IR 
One of the first studies to show increased retrieval 
effectiveness through resolving ambiguity was 
Sch?tze and Pederson (1995). They used clustering 
to discriminate between alternate uses of a word. 
The clusters they produced were apparently fine-
grained, although it is not clear if this observation 
was made with reference to a particular lexical re-
source. In terms of the accuracy to which they 
could discriminate meaning, a limited evaluation 
using a 10 word sample demonstrated accuracy 
approaching 90%. Results showed that retrieval 
effectiveness increased when documents were in-
dexed by cluster as opposed to raw terms. Per-
formance further increased when a word in the 
collection was assigned membership of its three 
most likely clusters. However, it is not clear if as-
signing multiple senses leads to coarser granularity 
or simply reduces the impact of erroneous disam-
biguation.  
Stokoe et al (2003) showed increased retrieval 
effectiveness through fine-grained disambiguation 
where a word occurrence in the collection was as-
signed one of the sense definitions contained in 
WordNet. The accuracy of their disambiguation 
was reported at 62% based on its performance over 
a large subset of SemCor (a collection of manually 
disambiguated documents). It remains unclear how 
accuracy figures produced on different collections 
can be compared. Stokoe et al (2003) did not 
measure the actual performance of their disam-
biguation when it was applied to the WT10G (the 
IR collection used in their experiments). This high-
lights the difficulty involved in quantifying the 
effects of disambiguation within an IR collection 
given that the size of modern collections precludes 
manual disambiguation.  
Finally, Kim et al (2004) showed gains through 
coarse-grained disambiguation by assigning all 
nouns in the WT10G collection (section 3) mem-
bership to 25 top level semantic categories in 
WordNet (for more detail about the composition of 
WordNet see section 4). The motivation behind 
coarse-grained disambiguation in IR is that higher 
accuracy is achieved when only differentiating be-
tween homonyms. Several authors (Sanderson, 
2000; Kim et al, 2004) postulate that fine-grained 
disambiguation may not offer any benefits over 
coarse-grained disambiguation which can be per-
formed to a higher level of accuracy. 
2.2 The Effects of Ambiguity on IR 
The studies described in section 2.1 provide em-
pirical evidence of the benefits of disambiguation. 
Unfortunately, they do not indicate the minimum 
accuracy or the optimal level of granularity re-
quired in order to bring about these benefits. Per-
haps more telling are studies which have attempted 
to quantify the effects of ambiguity on IR.  
Sanderson (1994) used pseudowords to add ad-
ditional ambiguity to an IR collection. Pseu-
dowords (Gale et al, 1992) are created by joining 
together randomly selected constituent words to 
create a unique term that has multiple controlled 
meanings. Sanderson (1994) offers the example of 
?banana/kalashnikov?. This new term features two 
pseudosenses ?banana? and ?kalashnikov? and is 
used to replace any occurrences of the constituent 
words in the collection, thus introducing additional 
ambiguity. In his study, Sanderson experimented 
with adding ambiguity to the Reuters collection. 
Results showed that even introducing large 
amounts of additional ambiguity (size 10 pseu-
dowords - indicating they had 10 constituents) had 
very little impact on retrieval effectiveness. Fur-
thermore, attempts to resolve this ambiguity with 
less than 90% accuracy proved extremely detri-
mental.  
Sanderson (1999) acknowledged that pseu-
dowords are unlike real words as the random selec-
tion of their constituents ensures that the 
pseudosenses produced are unlikely to be related, 
in effect only modeling homonymy. Several stud-
ies (Sch?tze, 1998; Gaustad, 2001) suggest that 
this failure to model polysemy has a significant 
impact. Disambiguation algorithms evaluated us-
ing pseudowords show much better performance 
than when subsequently applied to real words. 
Gonzalo et al (1998) cite this failure to model re-
lated senses in order to explain why their study 
into the effects of ambiguity showed radically dif-
ferent results to Sanderson (1994). They performed 
known item retrieval on 256 manually disambigu-
ated documents and showed increased retrieval 
effectiveness where disambiguation was over 60% 
accurate. Whilst Sanderson?s results no longer fit 
the empirical data, his pseudoword methodology 
does allow us to explore the effects of ambiguity 
without the overhead of manual disambiguation. 
Gaustad (2001) highlighted that the challenge lies 
in adapting pseudowords to account for polysemy. 
404
Krovetz (1997) performed the only study to 
date which has explicitly attempted to differentiate 
between homonymy and polysemy in IR. Using the 
Longmans dictionary he grouped related senses 
based on any overlap that existed between two 
sense definitions for a given word. His results sup-
port the idea that grouping together related senses 
can increase retrieval effectiveness. However, the 
study does not contrast the relative merits of this 
technique against fine-grained approaches, thus 
highlighting that the question of granularity re-
mains open. Which is the optimal approach? 
Grouping related senses or attempting to make 
fine-grained sense distinctions?  
3 Experimental Setup 
The experiments in this study use the WT10G cor-
pus (Hawking and Craswell, 2002), an IR web test 
collection consisting of 1.69 million documents. 
There are two available Query / Relevance Judg-
ments sets each consisting of 50 queries. This 
study uses the TREC 10 Web Track Ad-Hoc query 
set (NIST topics 501 ? 550). The relevance judg-
ments for these queries were produced using pool-
ing based on the top 100 ranked documents 
retrieved by each of the systems that participated in 
the TREC 10 Web Track. 
Initially the author produced an index of the 
WT10G and performed retrieval on this unmodi-
fied collection in order to measure baseline re-
trieval effectiveness. The ranking algorithm was 
length normalized TF.IDF (Salton and McGill, 
1983) which is comparable to the studies in section 
2. Next, two modified versions of the collection 
were produced where additional ambiguity in the 
form of pseudowords had been added. The first 
used pseudowords created by selecting constituent 
pseudosenses which are unrelated, thus introducing 
additional homonymy.  The second used a new 
method of generating pseudowords that exhibit 
polysemy (the methodology is described in section 
4.1). Contrasting retrieval performance over these 
three indexes quantifies the relative impact of both 
homonymy and polysemy on retrieval effective-
ness. The final step was to measure the effects of 
attempting to resolve the additional ambiguity 
which had been added to the collection. In order to 
do this, the author simulated disambiguation to 
varying degrees of accuracy and measured the im-
pact that this had on retrieval effectiveness.  
4 Methodology 
To date only Nakov and Hearst (2003) have looked 
into creating more plausible pseudowords. Work-
ing with medical abstracts (MEDLINE) and the 
controlled vocabulary contained in the MESH hi-
erarchy they created pseudosense pairings that are 
related. By identifying pairs of MESH subject 
categories which frequently co-occurred and se-
lecting constituents for their pseudowords from 
these pairings they produced a disambiguation test 
collection.  Their results showed that category 
based pseudowords provided a more realistic test 
data set for disambiguation, in that evaluation us-
ing them more closely resembled real words. The 
challenge in this study lay in adapting these ideas 
for open domain text.  
4.1 Pseudoword Generation 
This study used WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) to 
inform the production of pseudowords. WordNet 
(2.0) is a hierarchical semantic network developed 
at Princeton University. Concepts in WordNet are 
represented by synsets and links between synsets 
represent hypernmy (subsumes) and hyponymy 
(subsumed) relationships in order to form a hierar-
chical structure. A unique word sense consists of a 
lemma and the particular synset in which that 
lemma occurs.  WordNet is a fine-grained lexical 
resource and polysemy can be derived to varying 
degrees of granularity by traversing the link struc-
ture between synsets (figure 1).  
 
 
Figure 1. A Subsection of the Noun Hierarchy 
in WordNet

An important feature of pseudowords is the 
number of constituents as this controls the amount 
of additional ambiguity created. A feature of all 
previous studies is that they generate pseudowords 
with a uniform number of constituents, e.g. size 2, 
size 5 or size 10, thus introducing uniform levels of 
additional ambiguity. It is clear that such an ap-
proach does not reflect real words given that they 
do not exhibit uniform levels of ambiguity. The 
approach taken in this study was to generate pseu-
dowords where the number of constituents was 
variable. As each of the pseudowords in this study 
contain one query word from the IR collection then 
the number of constituents was linked directly to 
the number of senses of that word contained in 
WordNet. This effectively doubles the level of am-
biguity expressed by the original query word. If a 
query word was not contained in WordNet then 
this was taken to be a proper name and exempted 
from the process of adding ambiguity. It was felt 
that to destroy any unambiguous proper names, 
which might act to anchor a query, would dramati-
cally overstate the effects of ambiguity in terms of 
the IR simulation. The average size of the pseu-
dowords produced in these experiments was 6.4 
pseudosenses. 
When producing the traditional pseudoword 
based collection the only modification to Sander-
son?s (1994) approach (described in section 2), 
other than the variable size, involved formalizing 
his observation that the constituent words were 
unlikely to be related. Given access to WordNet it 
was possible to guarantee that this is the case by 
rejecting constituents which could be linked 
through its inheritance hierarchy. This ensures that 
the pseudowords produced only display ho-
monymy. 
In order to produce pseudowords that model 
polysemy it was essential to devise a method for 
selecting constituents that have the property of re-
latedness. The approach taken was to deliberately 
select constituent words that could be linked to a 
sense of the original query word through WordNet. 
Thus the additional ambiguity added to the collec-
tion models any underlying relatedness expressed 
by the original senses of the query word. Pseu-
dowords produced in this way will now be referred 
to as root pseudowords as this reflects that the am-
biguity introduced is modeled around one root 
constituent. Consider the following worked exam-
ple for the query ?How are tornadoes formed?? 
After the removal of stopwords we are left with 
?tornadoes? and ?formed? each of which is then 
transformed into a root pseudoword. The first step 
involves identifying any potential senses of the 
target word from WordNet. If we consider the 
word ?tornado? it appears in two synsets:  
 
1. tornado, twister -- (a localized and violently 
destructive windstorm occurring over land 
characterized by a funnel-shaped cloud ex-
tending toward the ground) 
 
2. crack, tornado -- (a purified and potent form 
of cocaine that is smoked rather than snorted) 
 
For each sense of the target word the system ex-
pands WordNet?s inheritance hierarchy to produce 
a directed graph of its hypernyms. Figure 2 shows 
an example of this graph for the first sense of the 
word ?tornado?. In order to ensure a related sense 
pair the system builds a pool of words which are 
subsumed by concepts contained in this graph. 
This is generated by recursively moving up the 
hierarchy until the pool contains at least one viable 
candidate. For a candidate to be viable it must meet 
the following criteria: 
 
1) It must exist in the IR collection. 
2) It must not be part of another pseudoword. 
3) It can not be linked (through WordNet) to 
another constituent of the pseudoword.  
 
The pool for sense 1 of ?tornado? consists of [hur-
ricane|typhoon], one of which is selected at ran-
dom. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  A Graph of the Hypernyms for the 
First Sense of the Word ?tornado?

This process is repeated for each noun and verb 
sense of the query word. In this example there is 
one remaining sense of the word ?tornado? - a 
slang term used to refer to the drug crack cocaine. 
For this sense the system produced a pool consist-
ing of [diacetylemorphine|heroin]. Once all senses 
of the query word have been expanded the result-
ing pseudoword, ?tornadoes/hurricane/heroin?, is 
then used to replace all occurrences of its constitu-
ents within the collection. Through this process the 
system produces pseudowords with pseudosense 
pairings which have subsuming relationships, e.g. 
?tornadoes/hurricane? are subsumed by the higher 
category of ?cyclone? whilst ?tornadoes/heroin? are 
subsumed by the higher semantic category of 
?hard_drug?.  
4.2 Pseudo-disambiguation 
In order to perform pseudo-disambiguation the 
unmodified collection acts as a gold standard 
model answer. Through reducing each instance of 
a pseudoword back to one of its constituent com-
ponents this models the selection process made by 
a disambiguation system. Obviously, the correct 
pseudosense for a given instance is the original 
word which appeared at that point in the collection. 
Variable levels of accuracy are introduced using a 
weighted probability model where the correct 
pseudosense for a given test instance is seeded 
with a fixed probability equivalent to the desired 
accuracy being simulated. When a disambiguation 
error is simulated one of the incorrect pseu-
dosenses is selected randomly. 
5 Results 
The first set of results (section 5.1) addresses the 
question of granularity by quantifying the impact 
that adding either additional homonymy or 
polysemy has on retrieval effectiveness. The sec-
ond set of results (section 5.2) looks at the question 
of disambiguation accuracy by simulating the im-
pact that varied levels of accuracy have on retrieval 
effectiveness.  
5.1 Homonymy vs. Polysemy 
Let us first consider the impact of adding addi-
tional homonymy. Figure 3 graphs precision across 
the 11 standard points of recall for retrieval from 
both the baseline collection and one where addi-
tional homonymy has been added. Note that the 
introduction of additional homonymy brings about 
a small drop in retrieval effectiveness. With regard 
to the single value measures contained in table 1, 
this is a decrease of 2.5% in terms of absolute R-
Precision (average precision after the total number 
of known relevant documents in the collection has 
been retrieved). This is a relative decrease of 
14.3%. Similar drops in both precision@10 (preci-
sion after the first 10 documents retrieved) and 
average precision are also seen.  
Next let us consider retrieval effectiveness over 
the root pseudoword collection where additional 
polysemy has been added (figure 4). Note that the 
introduction of additional polysemy has a more 
substantive impact upon retrieval effectiveness. In 
terms of R-Precision this decrease is 5.3% in abso-
lute terms, a relative decrease of 30% compared to 
baseline retrieval from the unmodified collection. 
In addition, an even larger decrease in preci-
sion@10 occurs where the introduction of addi-
tional polysemy brings about a 7% drop in retrieval 
effectiveness.  
In terms of the relative effects of homonymy 
and polysemy on retrieval effectiveness then note 
that adding additional polysemy has over double 
the impact of adding homonymy. This provides a 
clear indication that the retrieval process is more 
substantially affected by polysemy than ho-
monymy.

5.2 The Impact of Disambiguation 
We now address the second part of the research 
question: to what accuracy should disambiguation 
be performed in order to enhance retrieval effec-
tiveness? Figure 5 plots the impact, in terms of R-
Precision, of performing disambiguation to varying 
degrees of accuracy after additional homonymy 
has been added to the collection. The dotted line 
represents the breakeven point, with R-Precision 
below this line indicating reduced performance as 
a result of disambiguation. Results show that 
where additional homonymy has been added to the 
collection disambiguation accuracy at or above 
76% is required in order for disambiguation to be 
of benefit. Performing disambiguation which is 
less than 76% accurate leads to lower performance 
than if the additional homonymy had been left un-
resolved. 
Moving on to consider the root pseudoword 
collection (figure 6) note that the breakeven point 
is only 55% where additional polysemy has been 
added. Consider that the results in section 5.1 
showed that the introduction of additional 
polysemy had over double the impact of introduc-
ing additional homonymy. This is reflected in the 
relative effects of disambiguation in that the break-
even point is considerably lower for polysemy than 
homonymy.

6 Discussion 
The results in section 5.1 show that retrieval effec-
tiveness is more sensitive to polysemy than ho-
monymy. One explanation for this can be

hypothesized from previous studies (Krovetz and 
Croft, 1992; Sanderson and Van Rijsbergen, 1999) 
which highlight the importance of co-occurrence 
between query words. Where two (or more) words 
appear together in a query, statistical retrieval in-
herently performs some element of disambigua-
tion. However, in the case of a word with many 
closely related senses, co-occurrence between 
query words may not be sufficient for a given 
sense to become apparent. This is particularly ex-
asperated in Web retrieval given that the average 
query length in these experiments was 2.9 words. 
Clearly, the inherent disambiguation performed by 
statistical IR techniques is sensitive to polysemy in 
the same way as systems which explicitly perform 
disambiguation. 
With regard to disambiguation accuracy and IR 
(section 5.2) these experiments establish that per-
formance gains begin to occur where disambigua-
tion is between 55% and 76%.  Where within this 
range the actual breakeven point lies is dependent 
on the granularity of the disambiguation and the 
balance between polysemy and homonymy in a 
given collection. Consider that coarse-grained dis-
ambiguation is frequently advocated on the basis 
that it can be performed more accurately. Whilst 
this is undoubtedly true these results suggest that 
homonymy has to be resolved to a much higher 
level of accuracy than polysemy in order to be of 
benefit in IR.  
It would seem prudent to consider the results of 
this study in relation to the state-of-the-art in dis-
ambiguation. At Senseval-3 (Mihalcea et al, 2004) 
the top systems were considered to have reached a 
ceiling, in terms of performance, at 72% for fine-
grained disambiguation and 80% for coarse-
grained. When producing the English language test 
collections the rate of agreement between humans 
performing manual disambiguation was approxi-
mately 74%. This suggests that machine disam-
biguation has reached levels comparable to the 
performance of humans. In parallel with this the IR 
community has begun to report increased retrieval 
effectiveness through explicitly performing disam-
biguation to varying levels of granularity.  
A final point of discussion is the way in which 
we simulate disambiguation both in this study and 
those previously (Sanderson, 1994; Gonzalo et al, 
1998). There is growing evidence (Leacock et al, 
1998; Agirre and Martinez, 2004) to suggest that 
simulating uniform rates of accuracy and error 
across both words and senses may not reflect the 
performance of modern disambiguation systems. 
Supervised approaches are known to exhibit inher-
ent bias that exists in their training data. Examples 
include Zipf?s law (Zipf, 1949) which denotes that 
a small number of words make up a large percent-
age of word use and Krovetz and Croft?s (1992) 
observation that one sense of a word accounts for 
the majority of all use. It would seem logical to 
presume that supervised systems show their best 
performance over the most frequent senses of the 
most frequent words in their training data.   Not 
enough is known about the potential impact of 
these biases to allow for them to be incorporated 
into this simulation. Still, it should be noted that 
Stokoe et al (2003) utilized frequency statistics in 
their disambiguator and that a by-product of 
Sch?tze and Pederson?s (1992) approach was that 
they eliminated infrequently observed senses. 
There is supporting evidence from Sanderson and 
Van Rijsbergen (1999) to suggest that accounting 
for this frequency bias is in some way advanta-
geous. Therefore, it is worth considering that simu-
lating a uniform accuracy and error rate across all 
words and senses might actually offer a pessimistic 
picture of the potential for disambiguation and IR. 
Whilst this merits further study, the focus of this 
research was contrasting the relative effects of two 
types of ambiguity and both models were subject 
to the same uniform disambiguation.  
7 Conclusions 
This study has highlighted that retrieval systems 
are more sensitive to polysemy than homonymy. 
This leads the author to conclude that making fine-
grained sense distinctions can offer increased re-
trieval effectiveness in addition to any benefits 
brought about by coarse-grained disambiguation. It 
also emphasises that although coarse-grained dis-
ambiguation can be performed to a higher degree 
of accuracy, this might not directly translate to in-
creased IR performance compared to fine-grained 
approaches. This is in contrast to current thinking 
which suggests that coarse-grained approaches are 
more likely to bring about retrieval performance 
because of their increased accuracy. 
In terms of disambiguation accuracy and in-
creased retrieval effectiveness, results show poten-
tial benefits where accuracy is as low as 55% when 
dealing with just polysemy and rises to 76% when 
409
dealing with just homonymy. Obviously this study 
has simulated two extremes (polysemy or ho-
monymy) and the exact point where performance 
increases will occur is likely to be dependent on 
the interaction between homonymy and polysemy 
in a given query.   
With regard to simulation a more empirical ex-
ploration of the ideas expressed in this work would 
be desirable. However, the size of modern IR test 
collections dictates that future studies will need to 
rely more heavily on simulation. Therefore, until 
such time that a significant manually disambigu-
ated IR collection exists pseudowords remain an 
interesting way to explore the effects of ambiguity 
within a large collection. The challenge lies in pro-
ducing pseudowords that better model real words.
