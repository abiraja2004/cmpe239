Turkish, Finnish, and lhmgar ian Io a class called "ag

COlllbillaLiOll of several Iilorphel\]les. There is a root 
and several suffixes are conlbined lo this root in order 
to modil},' or extend its meaning. Whal  characterizes

contain words of considerable COnll~lexity, and parsing 
such languages necessitates a thorough morphological

attention ill con'tputational linguistics. Tile reason is

driwnl morpllological analyzer for Russian \[17\]. In 
addition, other tool; driwm morphological parsers for 
tile agglutinative langmtges Quechna \[9, 10\], Finnish

2.  The Turk i sh  Language 
Turkish is an agglutinative languageihat  belongs Io 
a group of \]anguagrs known as A\]taic \]anguages. For 
all agg\]ul inat ive laligllagc, t\]/c collrepl of" word is 
iuiir\]l \]arger than lhe sol c)\[ vocabil lary ileilts. ~Vord 
s lr l l r l  tll'es Call grow Io hi, relatively long b} addit ion 
of suttixes and solnetiiries contain an amount  of se- 
nlantic information equivalent to a complete sentence 
in another language. A I)opular example of coin- 
plex Turkish word formation is (,71'\]KOSI,OVAKYA- 
LILAf~TIItAMADI\['~.LAF{,IM1Z\])ANMI~SINIZ whose 
equivalent in English is "(it is speculated that) you 
had been one of those whom we could not convert 
to a Czechoslovakian." In this example, one word 
m Turkisll corresponds to a fllll sentence in English. 
Each suitix has a certain flmction and modifies the 
semantic information in the steni preceding it. In our 
example, the root mori'~heme ~EKOSLOVAKYA is 
the nalne of the country Czechoslovakia and the suffix 
- /,I converts the meaning into Czechoslovakian, while 
the following suffix LA~ makes a verb from the pre- 
vious stem meaning to become a Czechoslovakian, t, 
and so o11. 
2.1.  Turk ish  Phonet ic  Mode l  
Being phonetic, the Turkish language can be adal)ted 
t.o a number of different alphabets. In the, past, var- 
ious alphabets haw~ been used to transcribe Turkish, 
e.g., Arabic. Since 1928, Latin characters have been 
used. The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters of 
which 8 (A, E, I, L O, (3, U, (~) are vowels, and 21 
(B ,C ,C~,D,F ,G , (L  H, J ,K ,  L ,M.N,P ,R ,S , ,q , ,  
q, V, Y, Z) are consonants. 
Turkish word formation uses a number of phonetic 
harlrlony rules. Vowels and COltSOllants change in cer- 
tain ways when a suffix is apl)ended to a root, so that 
sucll harnlony constraints are not violated. 
2.1.1. Vowcl  Change iti Suff ixes 
Ahnost all suffixes in Turkish ilse one of two basic 
vowels and their allophones. We have denoted these 
sets of allophones with braces around the main vowels 
A and 1. as {A} and {I}.  The allophones of {At  are A 
and E, where {It represents I, i, U, or {r. The vowels 
O and (} are only used in root inorl)hemes (especially 
in the first syllable) of Turkish words. ~ 
The vowel harltlOllV rtlies require thai vowels in a silt L 
fix challge according to certain rules whell they are af- 
fixed to a stem. The first vowel in thr suftix changes 
according to the last vowel of the sl.em. Succeeding 
vowels ili tile suffix change according to the vowel pre- 
reding it. If we denole the preceding vowel (lie it in 
the sten, or in the suffix) by v then {At is resolved as 
A if r is A, 1. O. or U. otherwise it is resolved as E. 
OiL the other band, {I} is resolw~d as \[ if e is A or 1. as 
i i fe i sEor i ,  as U if t: is O or U. and as 0 if v is (3 or 
U. For examl)le the word "YAPMAYACAI,7.TINIZ" 
can be broken htto sutiixes as: 
YA I ' /M  {A)/\[Y\]: '{ A )C{A} { t'~)4/{l)}S {I}/N {I}Z

of the word obey the rules almve, while a spelling like

2.2. Turkish morphology 
Turkish roots can be classified into two main classes: 
,ominal and verbal. The verbal class comprises the 
verbs, while l/Olllillal chess COlllprises llOIlllS, |)rOllOilllS 
and adjecl.iw's, etc. Ti le sulfixes that can be receiw~d 
by either of these groups are different, i.e., a suffix 
which C~lll bt, a|Iix(!d to ~1 llOlllillRl l 'oot ci%11 l lot b(!

if the word YAPMAI(  (to make) were typed as YP- 
.\I,\I,2 or YAPMKA.  the word would not be matched 
by the expression and its spelling wouhl be reported 
incorrect. On tile other hand, ifil, wew written as 
YAPMEI( ,  where a vowel harmony error is made, it 
would pass the syllabification cheek, but would lie re- 
porled as misspelled during morl/holJhonemic checks. 
3.3 .  Root  Determinat ion  
Before analyzing the morpholAmnenfic and morpho 
logical structures of a Tm'kish word, the root has to 
be determined. If \[he word passes the syllabification 
check, its root is searched in the dictionary rising a 
maxilnal match algorithm. In this algorithm, lirst 
; \[he list of all \[lags can Im hmnd in Solak \[2(1\]. 
AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO6-r 1992 42  
the whole word is searched in the dictionary, If it 
is found then the word has no suffixes and therefore 
its spelling is correct. Otherwise, we remove a letter 
from tile right and search tile restllting substring. We 
continue this by removiug letters from the right until 
we find a root. If no root can be found although the 
first letter of the word is reached, tile word is reported 
as misspelled. 
The max imum length substring of the word that is 
present in tile dictionary is riot always its root. If 
fin't.her analyses how that the word is misspelled, a
new root is searched m the dictionary, this time re- 
moving letters from the end of the previous root.. If 
a Ilew root can be found the same operations are re- 
peated, otherwise tile word is reported &s misspelled. 
Root determination presents some dittieulties wheu 
the root of the word is deformed. For the root words 
which have to be deformed during certain aggluti- 
nations, a flag indicating that property is set in the 
dictionary. For example, the root of the word ,~EHRE 
(to the city) must be found as ~jglt iR (city). In order 
to determine it correctly, when the substring SEHR is 
not found in the dictionary, considering that it illay 
be a deforined root by vowel ellipsis, the vowel I is 
inserted between the consonants 11 and R, and the 
word ~EHIR is searched in the dictionary. When it 
is fotmd, tile flag corresponding to vowel ellipsis is 
checked. Since it is set for this word, the root of the 
word S,'I';IIRE is dcterlnined as ~EI I iR,  and remain- 
ins analyses are contiuued. If that word were written 
as .~EHiRE, we should report it ms incorrect although 
~Elt iR + dative ease suffix form looks correct. For all 
other root defin'mations, the real root of the word can 
be fotnld by u/aking such cheeks and some necessary 
chauges (see \[20\]). 
For some roots both of the refills above are valid. 
For example, both METN\[  (accusative of text) and 
METiN\]\[ (accusative of strong) are correct although 
the root of both words is MET\[N (text, strong) be- 
catlse this word call be used in twodifferent meanings. 
3.4 .  Morphophonemic  Check  
Turkish words obey vowel and COllSOll~lllt harmouy 
rules during agglutination (see sections :3.2.1 and 
3.2.2). The vowel harmony check may be done jnst 
after tile root determination, but other morphophone- 
mic checks should be done during morphological nal- 
3sis, 
Afier tile root of the word is found, tile rest of tile 
word is considered as its suli\]xes. The first, vowel in 
the sutfixes part must be in harmony with tile last 
vowel of the root, while tile succeediug vowels must 
be in harnmny with the vowel preceding them. Since 
there are some sulllxes, such as --KEN, whose vow- 
e\]s ilever chaugo, when a disharl!lony is fouud, we 
cimck whether it, is tile result of such a snffix (e.g., 
YANARI,2I'\]N (while iI is burning)). 
PRec. OF COLING-92. NANrEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
SomP words of foreign origin do uot ohey vowel har- 
mony rules during agglutination (e.g., KONTI IOL  
(control)). Before ttae w)wel harmony cheeks are 
doue, the tlag correslJonding to that property must 
I,e checked, If it is sol for the root of the word, 
du, vowel harmony check must he apl)lied inversely 
Thus, the first vowel in I, he sulllxes part must be 
in disharmony with the last vowel of the root (e.g,, 
I (ONTI IOI ,LEI / ,  (controls)). As another interesting

\[f a word has receiw~d more than one derivationM 
sutfixes then mauy switches between parsers will be 
necessary. For example, the root of tile word BEYAZ- 
LA~TIRMAYANLARI}AN (from those which do not 
cause to hecome white) is found as the noun BEYAZ 
(white) in our dictionary. Then comes the suffix 
L{A},5, which makes a verb from a noun, tfierefor," 
a switch t.o the verb parser ha~s to be ulade. Parsillg 
contimles there until I.he suffix M{A} is nlatched. 
This sulfix can either make a w~rh a noun or negate 
i t  First cousideriug the possibility that it is used 
as a derivationM suffix, tile noun parser is invoked. 
'file rmnaiuing part of the word can not be parsed 
by 1his parser. So accepthlg M{A} as the negation 
suffix, tile verb parser is returned to ;hid parsing con- 
tinues there. Later comes the sullix \ [Y \ ]{A}N,  which 
is a sulfix i.fiat i l lakes ;t lIOill\] fronl a verb, so ~lgS.ill 
a switch to the noun parser is made. Continuing in 
this p~trser, the word is parsed correctly. 
Some Turkish roots call take the sullixes helonging 
to both nominal or verhal chLsses. \[:or such roots if 
parsing is unsuccessfld in the first parser chosen, the 
other olle UlnSt alsG be tried. For exalnphL (fie root of 
the word A(\ ]LAR (hungry I)eOl)fi~) is At7. 'Ellis root 
may either he used as a verb (open) or as a uoun 
(hungry). If parsing is first at tempted with tile ver- 
bal parser it will he unsuccessful. So we backtrack 
aud use the nominal parser. With the nominal parser 
the word can be parsed successfully. 
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the word anM-

application to spelling checking of this language. 
Parsing agglutinative word structures necessitates 
rather nontrivial phonological and morphological 
analyses which present special difficulties in the de- 
velopment of parsers for such languages, not usually 
encountered in parsers for other languages. As a re- 
sub, the number of parsers developed for agghitina- 
five languages, and particularly for Turkish, is quite 
limit.ed, and they have certain shortcomings. We have 
solved most of the problelns encountered in the previ- 
ous parsers by lnaking a detailed and careful research 
on Turkish word formation rules and their exceptions 
\[20\]. These results may hopefully be helpful for fu- 
ture researchers on Turkish linguistics. We should 
note t.hat ewm though it is claimed that word for- 
marion rules in Turkish are well-defined and Turkish 
is a very regular language, as used today it shows 
many irregularities that cause the ln'oblem of parsing 
I.his language to become a very hard and interesting 
problem 
Many grammar  books haw~ been referred to collect, 
Turkish word format.ion rules, hi those books, af- 
ter each rule is defined, usually it is reminded that 
tliel'e lllay occur sonte exceptions to that, rule ill SOllle 
condit,ions, hut mostly those conditions can not be 
"well" defined, For example, in all Turkish grammar  
books, it is said that "When a Turkish word ending 
wit.h one of the consonants P, ~', T,  K receives a suf- 
fix beginning with a consonant, that final consonant 
is soft,cued, bul t, here are some such words whose fi- 
nal consonant does not change." \]lowever, none of 
the books says what the common propert.y of those 
words which do not obey t,o that rule is, because most

probably it is not known yet. Ill order t,o inchlde that 
rule correctly in the parser, all words having the in- 
dicated prol)erty have been examined, the list of t,he 
irregular ones have been obtained, and speeial checks

reasonably complete, there still remains many technl 
cal terms and proper names which are not included. 
Adding more and nlore words will obviously increase 
tile flmelional performance of the checker. Another 
reason is that, most of the derivational sultixes are 
not mchtded rote'die rules. I f (  stem that is derived 
by such a suffix is not present ill the dictionary, it is 
reported as misspelh~d. Additionally. for th( deriw~-

of the roots that they can be a\[lixed to may no( he

examining the dictionary As far as execution pertbr-
