Abstract 
This essay provides a summary of research 
related to My Reviewers, a web-based appli-
cation that can be used for teaching and as-
sessment purposes.  The essay concludes 
with speculation about ongoing develop-
ment efforts, including a social helpfulness 
algorithm, a badging system, and Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) features. 
1 Introduction 
The essay summarizes research that has identi-
fied ways My Reviewers can be used to:  
? integrate formative with summative 
evaluations, thereby enabling universi-
ties and teachers to alter curriculum ap-
proaches in real time in response to 
ongoing assessment information, 
? assess students? critical thinking, re-
search, and writing skills?aggregating 
not a small percentage but all of the 
marked up documents (in our case about 
16,000 evaluations by teachers of stu-
dents? intermediate and final drafts of es-
says/semester), 
? enable reviewers (teachers and students) 
to provide more objective feedback, fa-
cilitating ?Objectivity 2.0,? a form of 
evaluative consensus mediated after ex-
tensive crowdsourcing of standards, 
? provide conclusive evidence that can be 
used to compare the efficacy of particu-
lar curricular approaches, 
? enable students and writing programs to 
track progress related to specific learning 
outcomes (from project to project, course 
to course, year to year), 
? inform faculty development and teacher 
response, and 
? create an e-portfolio of students? work 
that reflects their ongoing progress.  
 
 
2 What is My Reviewers? 
My Reviewers is a web-based application that 
enables students, teachers, and universities to  
? aggregate assessment information about 
students? critical thinking and writing 
skills, 
? mark up PDF documents (with sticky 
notes, text box notes, drawing tools, 
etc.), 
? grade documents according to a rubric, 
? assign and conduct or grade peer re-
views.  (My Reviewers enables teachers 
to see at a glance each student?s in-text 
annotations, end-note comments, and ru-
bric scores), 
? use a library of comments and resources 
tailored to address common writing 
problems, and 
? crowdsource comments and resources. 
The permissions-based workflow features of 
My Reviewers enable teachers and students to use 
a rubric and commenting tools to review and 
grade student writing while protecting student 
confidentiality behind a Net ID. 
My Reviewers is founded on the assumptions 
that language and learning are social practices, 
and that students can provide valuable feedback 
to one another based on their backgrounds as 
readers and critical thinkers. 
By enabling students to track their progress (or 
lack of progress) according to various evaluative 
criteria (such as focus, evidence, organization, 
style, and format), My Reviewers clarifies aca-
demic expectations and facilitates reflection and 
awareness of teachers? evaluations and concerns, 
thereby helping students grow as writers, editors, 
and collaborators.  Furthermore, the pedagogical 
materials embedded into the tool?videos, ex-
planatory materials, exercises, library of com-
ments with supporting hyperlinks?clarify 
19
grading criteria for both students and teachers.  
In summary, by aggregating assessment results in 
innovative new ways, My Reviewers reshapes 
how teachers respond to writing, how students 
conduct peer reviews, how students track their 
development as writers and reader feedback, and 
how universities can conduct assessments of 
students? development as critical thinkers and 
writers. 
3 Context and Methods 
The FYC (First-Year Composition) Program at 
the University of South Florida is one of the lar-
gest writing programs in the U.S, serving ap-
proximately 7,500 students in two composition 
courses each year, ENC 1101 and ENC 
1102.  Thanks to funding from USF Tech Fee 
Funds and CTE21, we have piloted use of My 
Reviewers for the past three years, using My Re-
viewers to assess over 30,000 student documents.  
Last semester (Fall 2011), approximately 70 
first-year composition instructors assessed 
16,000 essays (including early, intermediate, and 
final drafts)?not counting student peer re-
views.  This semester (Spring 2012), we are on 
course for reviewing another 16,000 essays.  The 
National Council of Teachers of English awarded 
the FYC Program the 2011-12 CCCC (Confer-
ence on College Composition and Communica-
tion) Writing Program Certificate of Excellence 
Award based in part on its development of My 
Reviewers.  
Over the past eight years, our teachers and 
writing program administrators have crowd-
sourced a community rubric by employing vari-
ous peer-production technologies and face-to-
face meetings (see Table 1).  The early stages of 
our development process are reported in 
Vieregge, Stedman, Mitchell, & Moxley?s (2012) 
Agency in the Age of Peer Production, an ethno-
graphic monograph published by NCTE?s series 
on Studies in Writing and Rhetoric.  
Since moving from a requirement for our in-
structors to use a printed version of the commu-
nity rubric to using My Reviewers, which enables 
teachers to view the rubric while grading and 
associates rubric scores with marked-up texts, we 
have observed some benefits: While we may 
have 500 sections of the 1101 and 1102 courses, 
we want all of these sections to focus on shared 
outcomes.  We have found our use of My Re-
viewers helps ensure students have a more com-
parable experience than when paper rubrics were 
used.  Back in the days of the printed version of 
the rubric, at the end of the semester when we 
surveyed students about usage, about half of our 
students reported they were unfamiliar with the 
rubric.  One of the advantages of an online tool 
like My Reviewers for universities is that it en-
ables writing program administrators to better 
ensure instructors and students are keeping up 
with our shared curriculum.  Also, by using a 
single analytic rubric tool across sections, we can 
assess progress by student, teacher, section, and 
rubric criteria.

As rhetoricians, we understand the value of 
using rubrics that address the demands of spe-
cific rhetorical contexts.  When addressing dif-
ferent genres, audiences, disciplines and when 
using multiple media to remediate texts (Twitter, 
podcasts, movies, print documents), students 
clearly benefit from receiving feedback related to 
conventions in those genres, disciplines, and 
media.  Given this, we clearly understand why 
Peter Elbow, Chris Anson, William Condon, 
among other assessment leaders, fault universi-
ties for employing a generic rubric like our 
community rubric to assess texts across projects, 
genres, courses, media and so on.  Like Elbow 
(2006), Anson (2011), and Condon (2011), we 
see enormous value in clarifying specific grading

criteria for specific projects, and we understand 
grading criteria change along with changes in 
different rhetorical situations.  Plus, as composi-
tionists, we understand that writers need different 
kinds of feedback when they are in different 
stages of the composing process.  Using a rubric 
like our community rubric early in the writing 
process can clearly be overkill.  There is no point 
in discussing style, for example, when the writer 
needs to be told that his or her purpose is unclear 
or not satisfactory given the assignment specifi-
cations.  Nonetheless, we have found?as we 
discuss below?some benefits for using our 
community rubric to assess multiple projects, 
even ones that address different audiences, gen-
res, and media.  
4 Independent Validation of the Com-
munity Rubric by the USF Office of 
Institutional Effectiveness 
While we are currently seeking funding to add 
administration features that would enable users 
to write their own rubrics or import rubrics, My 
Reviewers employs a single community rubric 
(see Table 1) that has been validated by an inde-
pendent assessment conducted by the Office of 
Institutional Effectiveness at the University of 
South Florida in the spring of 2010.   
To conduct the assessment, 10 independent 
scorers reviewed the third/final drafts of 249 
students? ENC 1101 Project 2 essays and these 
same students? ENC 1102 Project 2 essays.  The 
Office of Institutional Effectiveness settled on 
this odd number?249?because it represented 
5% of our total unique student head count (4,980 
students) for the 2009/2010 academic year. The 
scorers used the same scoring rubric to evaluate 
all 498 essays according to eight criteria deline-
ated in our community rubric.  Scorers did not 
provide comments nor did they have access to 
the markup and grading provided by the stu-
dents? classroom instructors. 
Before the raters scored the randomly chosen 
student essays, an assessment expert from the 
Office of Institutional Effectiveness led a brief 
discussion of the rubric and asked the scorers to 
read sample essays.  He then computed an inter-
rater agreement of .93.  Confident our scorers 
understood our rubric and encouraged by our 
inter-rater reliability, raters subsequently scored 
the 498 essays over a three-day period. 
Naturally, we were pleased to see that our as-
sessment results suggested students were making 
some progress on all measures of writing and 
critical thinking, that their 1102 Project 2 scores 
were higher than their Project 2 scores in 1101, 
although we were underwhelmed by the degree 
of improvement.  We also were not really sur-
prised that we were able to reach a high level of 
inter-rater reliability among raters.   
However, this study did reveal a counterintui-
tive and remarkable result: by comparing the 
rankings of the independent scorers with the 
rankings of these students? classroom teachers, 
we found no statistical difference on seven of the 
eight rubric criteria. In other words, when it 
came to scoring eight criteria, the only difference 
between the independent scorers and the class-
room teachers was ?Style (Basics),? a criterion 
that represents a 5% grade weight when the ru-
bric was used to grade student papers.  This dis-
crepancy may suggest that the independent 
scorers were being more lenient regarding the 
students? grammatical and stylistic infelicities 
than the students? classroom teachers. 
Overall, the high level of agreement among 
the classroom teachers and the independent scor-
ers suggests My Reviewers (perhaps by clarifying 
the grading criteria for teachers and students) 
enables diverse reviewers to mediate a shared 
evaluation of texts, to reach an unprecedented 
level of inter-rater reliability among large groups 
of readers?what we might call ?Objectivity 
2.0.? 
In a recent exchange on the Writing Program 
Administrator Listserv, Chris Anson, this year?s 
Chair of the Conference on College Composition 
and past president of the Writing Program Ad-
ministrators writes: ?[the] Problem with [generic] 
rubrics is their usual high level of generalization 
(which makes them worthless).?  In a subsequent 
co-authored essay, ?Big Rubrics and Weird Gen-
res:  The Futility of Using Generic Assessment 
Tools Across Diverse Instructional Contexts,? 
Anson et. al. (in press) write: ?Put simply, ge-
neric, all-purpose criteria for evaluating writing 
and oral communication fail to reflect the lin-
guistic, rhetorical, relational, and contextual 
characteristics of specific kinds of writing or 
speaking that we find in higher education.? 
While we share Anson?s preferences for ru-
brics that are designed to address the particular 
conventions of specific genres, audiences and 
media, and while we hope to secure the funding 
we need to add greater flexibility to My Review-
ers?so we can better account for different rhe-
torical situations and media?, our research 
demonstrates the value and credibility of using a 
community rubric to assess multiple genres, even 
22
ones that are quite distinct, such as the personal 
narrative essays versus third-person based re-
search reports.  Perhaps our results suggest that 
the eight criteria defined by our rubric are gener-
alizable enough across disciplines, genres, and 
media that university faculty can recognize them 
and employ them in meaningful ways to reach 
Objectivity 2.0.   
To be completely frank, we are somewhat as-
tounded by the inter-rater reliability we have 
been able to achieve among such diverse readers, 
and we wonder whether a rubric such as our 
community rubric can be used meaningfully to 
overcome the ?courseocentrism? that Gerald 
Graff (2010) has described as undermining edu-
cation in the U.S.  Perhaps a tool such as My 
Reviewers can be used to leverage communica-
tion across departments, perhaps general-
education wide, to address the common charac-
teristics of academic prose that faculty across 
disciplines value.  
5 Assess Undergraduate Learning 
Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa have received 
worldwide attention for their evidence and argu-
ment in Academically Adrift (2011) that under-
graduates fail to learn much despite their 
coursework.  In contrast, by comparing students? 
scores from project to project, we have been able 
to demonstrate students? development as writers, 
researchers, and critical thinkers.  Note, for ex-
ample, our evidence, shown in Figure 2, of stu-
dent development over one academic semester?
based not on a small sample size but on all stu-
dents in ENC 1102 that semester.

6 Make Evidence-Based Curriculum 
Changes 
As any seasoned teacher or administrator knows, 
not all curricular materials are equivalent.  On 
occasion, students perform poorly not because of 
a lack of innate inability but because of poor 
curricular planning on the part of the teachers 
(e.g., inadequate scaffolding of projects).  Figure 
3 illustrates ways My Reviewers can be used to 
improve the curriculum in light of evidence?
illustrating ways assessment results can be used 
to inform curriculum changes.  In this example, 
program administrators made changes to the 
historiography project (Project 2) from the 
Spring 2010 semester, and, subsequently, in the 
Fall 2011 semester students scored significantly 
better on most measures (Langbehn, McIntyre, 
Moxley, 2012).

2010 vs. Fall 2011 Semesters 
7 Compare Alternative Curricular Ap-
proaches 
Use of a community rubric across genres, cour-
ses and disciplines can also be used to chart stu-
dent progress, or lack of progress, or to indicate 
distinctions between the levels of difficulty im-
posed by unique projects/genres.  On occasion, 
the lack of student success can be linked to issues 
pertaining to curriculum design as opposed to a 
particular student deficit.  Figure 4 shows the 
comparison of student scores in two alternative 
courses, taken in succession by students at our 
university?results that suggest we need to once 
again rethink our curriculum for 1101 despite our 
intuition that the course was well designed and 
well received:

8 Develop and Compare New Models 
for Teaching and Learning 
Writing programs can use tools such as My Re-
viewers to compare alternative curriculums. We 
are currently providing three alternative approa-
ches to teaching writing in university settings?
the traditional approach, where students meet 
three hours each week in class; an online model; 
and a collaborative model, which requires stu-
dents to use My Reviewers to conduct two cycles 
of peer review and two cycles of teacher feed-
back?as illustrated partially in Figure 5. 
9 NLP Features Under Development  
We are currently implementing a library of 
comments, which we developed by analyzing 
approximately  30,000 annotations and 20,000 
endnotes; we are in the process of developing 
resources to help students better understand tea-
cher and peer comments.   
We are seeking additional funding to develop 
an algorithm and badging system to inspire more 
effective peer-review.  By enabling students to 
earn badges according to the quality of their 
feedback, as measured by their peers and stu-
dents, we are hoping to provide a further incen-
tive for quality feedback.  We would like to tie 
the badges to the number of substantive and edi-
torial critiques that the document authors account 
for when revising, by endorsements by teachers 
for peer feedback, and by overall rankings of 
peer reviews. 
Eventually we hope to add NLP (Natural Lan-
guage Processing) tools that identify repeated 
patterns of error?as identified by past and pre-
sent teachers who have used the tool.  For exam-
ple, students could be informed when they have 
received similar feedback in the past, and they 
could be offered hyperlinks back to past, similar 
comments.  We can imagine features that high-
light for teachers common comments on specific 
sets of papers or projects.  Perhaps OER (Open 
Education Resources) such as Writing Com-
mons, http://writingcommons.org, could be sug-
gested as teachers and peers make comments. 
10 Conclusions 
In his seminal work, The Wealth of Networks, 
Yochai Benkler wisely remarks,  
 
Different technologies make different kinds 
of human action and interaction easier or 
harder to perform. All other things being 
equal, things that are easier to do are more 
likely to be done, and things that are harder 
to do are less likely to be done.  (17) 
 
My Reviewers, and other tools like it that are in 
development, shatter pedagogical practices by 
making it easier to provide comments, easier to 
organize and grade peer reviews, and easier to 
conduct assessments based on whole populations 
rather than randomly selected groups.  The Lear-
ning Analytics embedded in tools like My Re-
viewers can empower students, teachers, and 
administrators in meaningful ways.
