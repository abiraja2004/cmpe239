Abstract 
A speech-to-speech translation project 
(S2S) has been conducted since 2006 by 
the Human Language Technology labora-
tory at the National Electronics and Com-
puter Technology Center (NECTEC) in 
Thailand. During the past one year, there 
happened a lot of activities regarding tech-
nologies constituted for S2S, including 
automatic speech recognition (ASR), ma-
chine translation (MT), text-to-speech syn-
thesis (TTS), as well as technology for lan-
guage resource and fundamental tool de-
velopment. A developed prototype of Eng-
lish-to-Thai S2S has opened several re-
search issues, which has been taken into 
consideration. This article intensively re-
ports all major research and development 
activities and points out remaining issues 
for the rest two years of the project. 
1 Introduction 
Speech-to-speech translation (S2S) has been ex-
tensively researched since many years ago. Most of 
works were on some major languages such as 
translation among European languages, American 
English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. There is 
no initiative of such research for the Thai language. 
In the National Electronics and Computer Tech-
nology Center (NECTEC), Thailand, there is a 
somewhat long history of research on Thai speech 
and natural language processing. Major technolo-
gies include Thai automatic speech recognition 
(ASR), Thai text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), Eng-
lish-Thai machine translation (MT), and language 
resource and fundamental tool development. These 
basic technologies are ready to seed for S2S re-
search. The S2S project has then been conducted in 
NECTEC since the end of 2006. 
The aim of the 3-year S2S project initiated by 
NECTEC is to build an English-Thai S2S service 
over the Internet for a travel domain, i.e. to be used 
by foreigners who journey in Thailand. In the first 
year, the baseline system combining the existing 
basic modules applied for the travel domain was 
developed. The prototype has opened several re-
search issues needed to be solved in the rest two 
years of the project. This article summarizes all 
significant activities regarding each basic technol-
ogy and reports remaining problems as well as the 
future plan to enhance the baseline system.
The rest of article is organized as follows. The 
four next sections describe in details activities 
conducted for ASR, MT, TTS, and language re-
sources and fundamental tools. Section 6 summa-
rizes the integration of S2S system and discusses 
on remaining research issues as well as on-going 
works. Section 7 concludes this article. 
2 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 
Thai ASR research focused on two major topics. 
The first topic aimed to practice ASR in real envi-
ronments, whereas the second topic moved to-
wards large vocabulary continuous speech recogni-
tion (LVCSR) in rather spontaneous styles such as 
news broadcasting and telephone conversation. 
Following sub-sections give more details. 
2.1 Robust speech recognition 
To tackle the problem of noisy environments, 
acoustic model selection was adopted in our sys-
tem. A tree structure was constructed with each 
leaf node containing speaker-, noise-, and/or SNR-
specific acoustic model. The structure allowed ef-
ficient searching over a variety of speech environ-
ments. Similar to many robust ASR systems, the 
selected acoustic model was enhanced by adapting 
by the input speech using any adaptation algorithm 
such as MLLR or MAP. In our model, however, 
simulated-data adaptation was proposed (That-
phithakkul et al, 2006). The method synthesized 
an adaptation set by adding noise extracted from 
the input speech to a pre-recorded set of clean 
speech. A speech/non-speech detection module 
determined in the input speech the silence portions, 
which were assumed to be the environmental noise. 
This approach solved the problem of incorrect 
transcription in unsupervised adaptation and en-
hanced the adaptation performance by increasing 
the size of adaptation data. 
2.2 Large-vocabulary continuous speech rec-
ognition (LVCSR) 
During the last few years, researches on continuous 
speech recognition were based mainly on two da-
tabases, the NECTEC-ATR (Kasuriya et al, 
2003a) and the LOTUS (Kasuriya et al, 2003b). 
The former corpus was for general purposes, 
whereas the latter corpus was well designed for 
research on acoustic phonetics as well as research 
on 5,000-word dictation systems. A number of re-
search works were reported, starting by optimizing 
the Thai phoneme inventory (Kanokphara, 2003). 
Recently, research has moved closer to real and 
spontaneous speech. The first task collaborated 
with a Thai telephone service provider was to build 
a telephone conversation corpus (Cotsomrong et al, 
2007). To accelerate the corpus development, 
Thatphithakkul et al (2007) developed a speaker 
segmentation model which helped separating 
speech from two speakers being conversed. The 
model was based on the simple Hidden Markov 
model (HMM), which achieved over 70% accuracy.
Another on-going task is a collection of broadcast 
news video. The aim of the task is to explore the 
possibility to use the existing read-speech model to 
boot broadcast news transcription. More details 
will be given in Section 5. 
3 Machine Translation (MT) 
It was a long history of the NECTEC English-to-
Thai machine translation (MT) which has been 
publicly serviced online. The ?Parsit? 1  system 
modified from the engine developed by NEC, Ja-
pan, which was a rule-based MT (RBMT). Over 
900 parsed rules were coded by Thai linguists. The 
system recognized more than 70,000 lexical words 
and 120,000 meanings.

major problems of parsing Thai, (a) coordination 
with gapping and (b) verb serialization. 
3.1 Thai-to-English MT 
Recently, there has been an effort to develop the 
first rule-based system for Thai-to-English MT. 
The task is much more difficult than the original 
English-to-Thai translation since the Thai word 
segmentation, sentence breaking, and grammar 
parser are all not complete. Coding rules for pars-
ing Thai is not trivial and the existing approach 
used to translate English to Thai cannot be applied 
counter wise. Last year, a novel rule-based ap-
proach appropriate for Thai was proposed 
(Boonkwan and Supnithi, 2007). The approach, 
called memory-inductive categorical grammar 
(MICG), was derived from the categorical gram-
mar (CG). The MICG introduced memorization 
and induction symbols to solve problems of ana-
lytic languages such as Thai as well as many spo-

ken languages. In parsing Thai, there are two major 
problems, coordination with gapping and verb se-
rialization. Figure 1 shows examples of the two 
problems with the MICG solution, where the 
square symbol denotes the chunk to be memorized 
and the diamond symbol denotes the chunk to be 
induced. A missing text chunk can be induced by 
seeking for its associated memorized text chunk.  
3.2 TM and SMT 
In order to improve the performance of our transla-
tion service, we have adopted a translation memory 
(TM) module in which translation results corrected 
by users are stored and reused. Moreover, the ser-
vice system is capable to store translation results of 
individual users. A na?ve user can select from the 
list of translation results given by various users. 
Figure 3 captures the system interface.  
Due to powerful hardware today, research has 
turned to rely more on statistical approaches. This 
is also true for the machine translation issue. Sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) has played an 
important role on modeling translation given a 
large amount of parallel text. In NECTEC, we also 
realize the benefit of SMT especially on its adapta-
bility and naturalness of translation results. How-
ever, a drawback of SMT compared to RBMT is 
that it works quite well on a limited domain, i.e. 
translating in a specific domain. This is actually 
suitable to the S2S engine which has been designed 
to work in only a travel domain. Therefore, in par-
allel to RBMT, SMT is being explored for limited 
domains. Two parallel text corpora have been con-
structed. The first one, collected by ATR under the 
Asian speech translation advanced research (A-
STAR)2 consortium, is a Thai incorporated version 
of the Basic travel expression (BTEC) corpus (Ki-
kui et al, 2003). This corpus will seed the devel-
opment of S2S in the travel domain. The second 
parallel corpus contains examples of parallel sen-
tences given in several Thai-English dictionaries.  
The latter corpus has been used for a general 
evaluation of Thai-English SMT. Details of both 
corpora will be given in the Section 5. 
4 Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) 
Thai TTS research has begun since 2000. At pre-
sent, the system utilizes a corpus-based unit-

selection technique. A well-constructed phoneti-
cally-balanced speech corpus, namely ?TSynC-1?, 
containing approximately 13 hours is embedded in 
the TTS engine, namely ?Vaja?3. Although the lat-
est version of Vaja achieved a fair speech quality, 
there are still a plenty of rooms to improve the sys-
tem. During the past few years, two major issues 
were considered; reducing the size of speech cor-
pus and improving unit selection by prosody in-
formation. Following sub-sections describe the 
detail of each issue. 
4.1 Corpus space reduction 
A major problem of corpus-based unit-selection 
TTS is the large size of speech corpus required to 
obtain high-quality, natural synthetic-speech. Scal-
ability and adaptability of such huge database be-
come a critical issue. We then need the most com-
pact speech corpus that still provides acceptable 
speech quality. An efficient way to reduce the size 
of corpus was recently proposed (Wutiwiwatchai et 
al., 2007). The method incorporated Thai phonetics 
knowledge in the design of phoneme/diphone in-
ventory. Two assumptions on diphone characteris-
tics were proved and used in the new design. One 
was to remove from the inventory the diphone 
whose coarticulation strength between adjacent 
phonemes was very weak. Normally, the corpus 
was designed to cover all tonal diphones in Thai. 
The second strategy to reduce the corpus was to 
ignore tonal levels of unvoiced phonemes. Ex-
periments showed approximately 30% reduction of 
the speech corpus with the quality of synthesized 
speech remained. 
4.2 Prosody-based naturalness improvement 
The baseline TTS system selected speech units by 
considering only phoneme and tone context. In the 
past few years, analyses and modeling Thai pro-
sodic features useful for TTS have been exten-
sively explored. The first issue was to detect 
phrasal units given an input text. After several ex-
periments (Tesprasit et al, 2003; Hansakunbun-
theung et al, 2005), we decided to develop a clas-
sification and decision tree (CART) for phrase 
break detection.  
The second issue was to model phoneme dura-
tion. Hansakunbuntheung et al (2003) compared 
several models to predict the phoneme duration.

Mainly, we found linear regression appropriate for 
our engine as its simplicity and efficiency. Both 
two prosody information were integrated in our 
Vaja TTS engine, which achieved a better synthe-
sis quality regarding subjective and objective 
evaluations (Rugchatjaroen et al, 2007). 
5 Language Resources and Tools 
A lot of research issues described in previous sec-
tions definitely requires the development and as-
sessment of speech and language corpora. At the 
same time, there have been attempts to enhance the 
existing language processing tools that are com-
monly used in a number of advanced applications. 
This section explains the activities on resource and 
tool development. 
5.1 Speech and text corpora 
Table 1 summarizes recent speech and text corpora 
developed in NECTEC. Speech corpora in NEC-
TEC have been continuously developed since 2000. 
The first official corpus under the collaboration 
with ATR was for general purpose (Kasuriya et al, 
2003a). The largest speech corpus, called LOTUS 
(Kasuriya et al, 2003b), was well-designed read 
speech in clean and office environments. It con-
tained both phonetically balanced utterances and 
news paper utterances covering 5,000 lexical 
words. The latter set was designed for research on 
Thai dictation systems. Several research works 
utilizing the LOTUS were reported as described in 
the Section 2.2. 
The last year was the first-year collaboration of 
NECTEC and a telephone service provider to de-
velop the first Thai telephone conversation speech 
corpus (Cotsomrong et al, 2007). The corpus has 
been used to enhance the ASR capability in dealing 
with various noisy telephone speeches. 
Regarding text corpora, as already mentioned in 
the Section 3, two parallel text corpora were de-
veloped. The first corpus was a Thai version of the 
Basic travel expression corpus (BTEC), which will 
be used to train a S2S system. The second corpus 
developed ourselves was a general domain. It will 
be used also in the SMT research. Another impor-
tant issue of corpus technology is to create golden 
standards for several Thai language processing top-
ics. Our last year attempts focused on two sets; a 
golden standard set for evaluating MT and a 
golden standard set for training and evaluating 
Thai word segmentation. Finally, the most basic 
but essential in all works is the dictionary. Within 
the last year, we have increased the number of 
word entries in our lexicon from 35,000 English-
to-Thai and 53,000 Thai-to-English entries to over 
70,000 entries both. This incremental dictionary 
will be very useful in sustaining improvement of 
many language processing applications.

5.2 Fundamental language tools 
Two major language tools have been substantially 
researched, word segmentation and letter-to-sound 
conversion. These basic tools are very useful in 
many applications such as ASR, MT, TTS, as well 
as Information retrieval (IR). 
Since Thai writing has no explicit word and sen-
tence boundary marker. The first issue on process-
ing Thai is to perform word segmentation. Our 
baseline morphological analyzer determined word 
boundaries and word part-of-speech (POS) simul-
taneously using a POS n-gram model and a prede-
fined lexicon. Recently, we have explored Thai 
named-entity (NE) recognition, which is expected 
to help alleviating the problem of incorrect word 
segmentation. Due to the difficulty of Thai word 
segmentation, we initiated a benchmark evaluation 
on Thai word segmentation, which will be held in 
2008. This will gather researchers who are inter-
ested in Thai language processing to consider the 
problem on a standard text corpus. 
The problem of incorrect word segmentation 
propagates to the letter-to-sound conversion (LTS) 
module which finds pronunciations on the word 
basis. Our original LTS algorithm was based on 
probabilistic generalized LR parser (PGLR). Re-
cently, we proposed a novel method to automati-
cally induce syllable patterns from a large text with 
no need for any preprocessing (Thangthai et al, 
2006). This approach largely helped alleviating the 
tedious work on text corpus annotation. 
Another important issue we took into account 
was an automatic approach to find pronunciations 
of English words using Thai phonology. The issue 
is particularly necessary in many languages where 
their local scripts are always mixed with English 
scripts. We proposed a new model that utilized 
both English graphemes and English phonemes, if 
found in an English pronunciation dictionary, to 
predict Thai phonemes of the word (Thangthai et 
al., 2007). 
6 Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2S) 
In parallel to the research and development of in-
dividual technology elements, some efforts have 
been on the development of Thai-English speech-
to-speech translation (S2S). Wutiwiwatchai (2007) 
already explained in details about the activities, 
which will be briefly reported in this section. 
As described briefly in the Introduction, the aim 
of our three-year S2S project is to develop an S2S 
engine in the travel domain, which will be given 
service over the Internet. In the last year, we de-
veloped a prototype English-to-Thai S2S engine, 
where major tasks turned to be the development of 
English ASR in the travel domain and the integra-
tion of three core engines, English ASR, English-
to-Thai RBMT, and Thai TTS. 
6.1 System development 
Our current prototype of English ASR adopted a 
well-known SPHINX toolkit, developed by Carne-
gie Mellon University. An American English 
acoustic model has been provided with the toolkit. 
An n-gram language model was trained by a small 
set of sentences in travel domain. The training text 
contains 210 patterns of sentences spanning over 
480 lexical words, all prepared by hands. Figure 2 
shows some examples of sentence pattern. 
 
 
Figure 2. Examples of sentence patterns for lan-
guage modeling (uppercases are word classes, 
bracket means repetition). 
 
In the return direction, a Thai ASR is required. 
Instead of using the SPHINX toolkit4, we built our 
own Thai ASR toolkit, which accepts an acoustic 
model in the Hidden Markov toolkit (HTK)5 for-
mat proposed by Cambridge University. The ?iS-
peech?6 toolkit that supports an n-gram language 
model is currently under developing.  
The English ASR, English-to-Thai RBMT, and 
Thai TTS were integrated simply by using the 1-
best result of ASR as an input of MT and generat-
ing a sound of the MT output by TTS. The proto-
type system, run on PC, utilizes a push-to-talk in-
terface so that errors made by ASR can be allevi-
ated.  
6.2 On-going works 
To enhance the acoustic and language models, a 
Thai speech corpus as well as a Thai-English paral-
lel corpus in the travel domain is constructing as 
mentioned in the Section 5.1, the Thai version of 
BTEC corpus. Each monolingual part of the paral-
lel text will be used to train a specific ASR lan-
guage model. 
For the MT module, we can use the parallel text 
to train a TM or SMT. We expect to combine the 
trained model with our existing rule-based model, 
which will be hopefully more effective than each 
individual model. Recently, we have developed a 
TM engine. It will be incorporated in the S2S en-
gine in this early stage. 
In the part of TTS, several issues have been re-
searched and integrated in the system. On-going 
works include incorporating a Thai intonation

Markov model (HMM) based speech synthesis, 
which will hopefully provide a good framework 
for compiling TTS on portable devices. 
7 Conclusion 
There have been a considerable amount of research 
and development issues carried out under the 
speech-to-speech translation project at NECTEC, 
Thailand. This article summarized and reported all 
significant works mainly in the last few years. In-
deed, research and development activities in each 
technology element, i.e. ASR, MT, and TTS have 
been sustained individually. The attempt to inte-
grate all systems forming an innovative technology 
of S2S has just been carried out for a year. There 
are many research and development topics left to 
explore. Major challenges include at least but not 
limited to the following issues: 
 The rapid development of Thai-specific ele-
ments such as robust Thai domain-specific 
ASR and MT 
 Migration of the existing written language 
translation to spoken language translation 
Recently, there have been some initiations of 
machine translation among Thai and other lan-
guages such as Javi, a minor language used in the 
southern part of Thailand and Mandarin Chinese. 
We expect that some technologies carried out in 
this S2S project will be helpful in porting to the 
other pairs of languages.
