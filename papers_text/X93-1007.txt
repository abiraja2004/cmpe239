1. INTRODUCTION 
This section presents a summary of the TIPSTER results, 
including some comparative system performance and 
some conclusions about the success of the detection half 
of the TIPSTER phase I project. For more details on the 
individual experiments, please see the system overviews. 
Four contractors were involved in the document detection 
half of TIPSTER. Two of the contractors worked in En- 
glish only (Syracuse University and HNC Inc.), one con- 
tractor worked in Japanese only (TRW Systems Develop- 
ment Division), and one contractor worked in both lan- 
guages (University of Massachusetts at Amherst). The 
four contractors had extremely varied approaches to the 
detection task. TRW transformed an operational English 
retrieval system (based on pattern matching using a fast 
hardware approach), into a Japanese version of the same 
operation, with a special interface designed to facilitate 
work in Japanese. The University of Massachusetts ap- 
proach involved taking a relatively small experimental 
system using a probabilistic inference net methodology, 
scaling it up to handle the very large amounts of text and 
long topics in TIPSTER, and modifying the algorithms to 
handle Japanese. Both Syracuse University and HNC Inc. 
built completely new systems to handle the English col- 
lection. In the case of Syracuse University, their system is 
based heavily on a natural anguage approach to retrieval, 
with many of the techniques traditionally used in docu- 
ment understanding applied to the retrieval task. HNC 
Inc. took a totally different approach, applying statistical 
techniques based on robust mathematical models (includ- 
ing the use of neural networks). 
There were three evaluations of the contractors' work; one 
at 12 months, one at 18 months, and the final one at 24 
months. In each case, the contractors working in English 
have made multiple experimental runs using the test col- 
lection, and turned in the top list of documents found. 
These results were first used to create the sample pool for 
assessment, and then were scored against he correct an- 
swers based on results from all runs (including TREC-I 
runs for the 18-month evaluation and TREC-2 runs for the 
24-month evaluation). Standard tables using re- 
call/precision and recall/fallout measures were distributed 
and compared. The evaluation of the Japanese work took 
place only at the 24-month period. 
2. 12 -MONTH EVALUATION 
The work done for the 12-month evaluation was mainly a 
scaling effort. Not all data was available so only partial 
results were completed. In particular, the University of 
Massachusetts urned in 7 runs using the adhoc topics, 
with experiments rying different parts of the topic to au- 
tomatically create the query, and also adding phrases. 
Additionally they tried some manually edited queries. 
HNC Inc. turned in 4 runs using the adhoc topics, with 
experiments also using different parts of the topic to auto- 
matically generate queries. Additionally they tried vari- 
ous types of "bootstrapping" methodologies to generate 
context vectors. Syracuse University turned in no runs, 
but had completed the extensive design work as proposed 
in their timeline. The University of Massachusetts also 
did 4 runs on the routing topics, but the lack of good train- 
ing data made this very difficult. In general the results for 
the systems was good, with the University of Mas- 
sachusetts outperforming HNC Inc. on the adhoc runs, but 
it was felt by all that this evaluation represented a very 
"baseline" effort. For these reasons, no graphs of these re- 
suits will be presented. 
3. 18 -MONTH EVALUATION 
By the 18-month mark, the systems had finished much 
more extensive sets of experiments. The University of 
Massachusetts continued to investigate the effects of using 
different parts of the topic for the adhoc runs, but this time 
trying different combinations using the inference net 
methodology. Figure 1 shows three INQRY runs for the 
adhoc topics done for the 18-month evaluation. The plot 
for INQRYV represents results from queries created auto- 
matically using most of the fields of the topics. The IN- 
QRYJ results are from the same queries, but including 
phrases and concept operators. The INQRYQ results 
33 
show the effects of manually editing the INQRYJ queries, 
with those modifications restricted to eliminating words 
and phrases, adding additional words and phrases from 
the narrative field, and inserting paragraph-level operators 
around words and phrases. As can be seen, the use of 
phrases in addition to single terms helped somewhat, but 
the results from manual modification of the queries were 
the best adhoc runs. 
Figure 1 also shows the two HNC adhoc results for the 
18-month evaluation period. These runs represent final 
results from many sets of bootstrapping runs in which 
HNC evolved techniques for completely automatically 
creating context vectors for the documents. The plot 
marked HNC2aV represents he results using these con- 
text vectors for retrieval and using automatically built 
queries from the concepts field of the topic. The 
HNC2aM results adds a rough Boolean filter to the pro- 
cess, requiring that three terms in the concepts field match 
terms in the documents before the context vectors are 
used for ranking. This Boolean filter provided consider- 
able improvements. 
Figure 2 shows the routing results for the 18-month evalu- 
ation. The three plots for the INQRY system represent a 
baseline method (INQRYA, same as INQRYJ adhoc ap- 
proach), and two modifications to this method. The IN- 
QRYP results how the effect of manually modifying the 
query, similar to the method used in producing the IN- 
QRYQ adhoc results. The plot for INQRYR shows the 
first results from probabilistic query expansion and 
reweighting performed automatically using relevance 
feedback techniques on the training data. Both methods 
improve results, with the automatic feedback method re- 
suits approaching the manual-modification method, espe- 
cially at the high recall area of the curve. 
The HNC routing results hown on figure 2 represent the 
use of two different ypes of neural networks. The plot 
marked HNCrtl is the baseline result, created by using the 
adhoc methods imilar to those used in run HNC2aV. The 
HNCrt2 results represent using neural network techniques 
to learn improved stem weights for the context vectors 
based on the training data. The HNCrt3 results come 
from using the training data to determine what type of 
routing query to use, i.e. an automated adhoc query (simi- 
lar to HNC2aM), a manual query, or a query using the 
neural network techniques (HNCrt2). Clearly the neural 
network learning techniques significantly improve perfor- 
mance, with the per topic "customization" performance 
(HNCrt3) working best. 
In terms of system comparison, the University of Mas- 
sachusetts runs were consistently better than the HNC 
runs for the adhoc topics, whereas for the routing topics 
both groups were similar. The results were a major im- 
provement over their baseline (12-month) results for both 
groups. 
At the 18-month evaluation period, Syracuse University 
had the first stage of their system in operation and turned 
in results for the first time. The results for adhoc and 
routing are shown in figures 3 and 4. Since the results are 
for only a subset of the data used by the other contractors, 
they cannot be directly compared. Additionally since the 
results are only for the ffi/st stage of retrieval, which em- 
phasizes high recall, they should not be viewed as the fi- 
nal results from the system. 
Figure 3 shows four Syracuse runs on the adhoc topics. 
The documents used are the subset of the collection hav- 
ing the Wall Street Journal only. The first three plots, 
DRsfcl, DRpnal, and DRtsal, represent three operations 
in the DR-LINK system. The first operation does a rough 
filtering operation on the data, only retrieving documents 
with suitable subject field codes. The next two operations 
locate proper nouns and look at document structure. 
There is a considerable improvement in performance be- 
tween the first two operations. The fourth run (DRfull) 
used a manual version of the second stage to produce final 
results. These results are for only half the topics, so can- 
not be strictly compared to the first three runs, but they do 
indicate the potential improvements toprecision that can 
be expected from the second stage. 
Figure 4 shows the same operations, and generally the 
same improvements, for the routing topics. In this case 
the subset of documents used was the AP newswire docu- 
ments. The same three operations discussed above are 
plotted here. There was no second stage trial for the rout- 
ing topics. These two graphs represent the baseline of the 
Syracuse system. 
4. 24 -MONTH EVALUATION 
For the 24-month evaluation, all groups turned in many 
runs. The runs were much more elaborate, with many dif- 
ferent ypes of parameters being tried. The University of 
Massachusetts tried 7 experiments with the adhoc topics, 
using complex methods of combining the topic fields, 
proximity restrictions, noun phrases, and paragraph opera- 
tors. Additionally an automatically-built thesaurus was 
tried. They also did 15 runs with the routing topics, try- 
ing various experiments combining relevance feedback, 
query combinations, proximity operators and special 
phrase additions. HNC Inc. did 4 adhoc runs using vari- 
ous types of learned context vectors. Additionally they 
tried a simulated feedback query construction run. For 
routing they did 5 runs, trying multiple experiments in 
different combinations of adhoc and neural net approach- 
es. Syracuse University turned in 10 runs for their

Adhoc and routing performance at the 18-month evaluation period (using WJS or AP on- 
36 
"upstream processing module" (3 adhoc and 7 routing), 
trying various types of ranking formulas. Additionally 
they did 13 runs using the full retrieval system (4 adhoc 
and 9 routing). Full descriptions of these runs are given 
in the system overviews. 
Figures 5 through 12 show the results from the 24-month 
evaluation. Figures 5 and 6 show some of the adhoc re- 
suits for the full collection, and figures 7 and 8 show some 
of the routing results. The results from Syracuse Universi- 
ty on a smaller subset of the document collection are 
shown in figures 9 through 12. 
Figure 5 shows the recall/precision curves for the adhoc 
topics. The three INQRY runs include their baseline 
method (INQ009), which is same as the baseline method 
INQRYJ developed at the 18-month evaluation period. 
The first modification (INQ012) uses the inference net to 
"combine" weights from the documents and weights from 
the best-matching paragraphs in the document. The sec- 
ond modification (INQ015) shows the new term expan- 
sion method using an automatically-built thesaurus. Both 
modifications show some improvements over the baseline 
method. 
The three HNC runs shown on figure 5 include a baseline 
(HNCadl) that is similar to their best 18-month adhoc ap- 
proach (HNC2aM), but that uses a required match of 4 
terms rather than 3. The HNCad3 results how the effects 
of using a larger context vector of 512 terms rather than 
only 280 terms for the baseline results. This causes a 
slight improvement. The HNCad2 results are using some 
manual relevance feedback. 
The University of Massachusetts results are better than the 
HNC results, but there were improvements in both sys- 
tems over the 18-month evaluation. Figure 6 shows the 
recall/fallout curves for the best runs of these two sys- 
tems. Both plots show the same differences in perfor- 
mance, but it can be seen on the recall/fallout curve that 
both systems are retrieving at a very high accuracy. At a 
recall of about 60 percent (i.e. about 60 percent of the rel- 
evant documents have been retrieved) the precision of the 
INQRY results is about 30 percent. The fallout, however, 
is about 0.0004, meaning that most non-relevant docu- 
ments are being properly screened out. This corresponds 
to a probability of false alarm rate of 0.0004 at this point, 
in ROC terminology. 
Figure 7 shows the routing results for both groups. The 
run marked INQ026 is the baseline run of the INQRY sys- 
tem and uses the same methodology asthe adhoc INQ009 
run. The other two runs add some type of relevance feed- 
back using the training documents. The plot marked 
INQ023 uses both relevance f edback and proximity oper- 
ators to add 30 terms and 30 pairs of terms from the rele- 
vant documents to the query. The most complex~ run, 
INQ030, constructed the queries imilarly to run INQ023, 
but additionally weighted the documents using a combina- 
tion method similar to adhoc run INQ012. These runs 
represented the best results from many different experi- 
ments, and the relevance feedback gives significant im- 
provement over the baseline runs. 
The HNC routing results also represent the best of many 
experiments. The results for HNCrt5 show the neural net- 
work learning using stem weighting, similar to HNCrt2 at 
the 18-month evaluation. The second two sets of results 
represent data fusion techiques, with HNCrtl being fusion 
of four types of retrievals, using the same combinations 
for all topics, and HNCrt2 using different combinations 
for different opics. The data fusion combinations both 
work well, but the per topic combination works the best, 
just as the less sophisticated version of this run worked 
best at the I8-month evaluation. 
Again the University of Massachusetts results were better 
than the HNC results, but with major improvements in 
both systems over the 18-month evaluation. Figure 8 
shows the recall/fallout curves for the best runs of both 
groups. 
The Syracuse runs were on a subset of the full collection 
so are not directly comparable. However they also 
showed significant improvements over their 18-month 
baseline. Figure 9 shows three first-stage Syracuse runs, 
the results of trying different complex methods of com- 
bining the information (subject field code, text structure, 
and other information) that is detected in the first-stage 
modules. The results of this combination are passed to 
the second stage (figure 10). Note that due to processing 
errors there were documents lost between stages, and 
these official results are therefore inaccurate. Additional- 
ly only 19 topics (out of 50) are shown in figure I0. The 
improvements that could have been expected o not show 
because of these problems. 
Figures 11 and 12 show the Syracuse routing runs. The 
first stage runs show not only the combinations from the 
adhoc, but also additional ways of integrating the data. 
Again there were processing errors with the second stage 
results, and therefore no improvement is shown using the 
second stage.

5. COMPARISON WITH TREC RESULTS 
How do the TIPSTER results compare with the TREC-2 
results? Two of the TIPSTER contractors submitted re- 
suits for TREC-2 and these can be seen in Figures 13 and 
14. These figures show the best TREC-2 adhoc and rout- 
ing results for the full collection. More information about 
the various TREC-2 runs can be found in the TREC-2 
proceedings \[1\]. The results marked "INQ001" are the 
TIPSTER INQUERY system, using methods imilar to 
their baseline TIPSTER INQ009 run. The "dortQ2", 
"Brkly3" and "crnlL2" are all based on the use of the Cot- 
nell SMART system, but with important variations. The 
"cmlL2" run is the basic SMART system, but using less 
than optimal term weightings (by mistake). The "dortQ2" 
results come from using the training data to find parame- 
ter weights for various query factors, whereas the "Brk- 
ly3" results come from performing statistical regression 
analysis to learn term weighting. The "CLARTA" system 
adds noun phrases found in an automatically-constructed 
thesaurus to improve the query terms taken from the top- 
ic. The plot marked "HNCadl" is the baseline adhoc run 
for the TIPSTER 24-month evaluation. The TIPSTER 
INQUERY system is one of the best performing systems 
for the TREC-2 adhoc topics. 
The routing results from TREC-2 (shown in figure 14) ex- 
hibit more differences between the systems. Again three 
systems are based on the Cornell SMART system. The 
plot marked "crnlCl" is the actual SMART system, using 
the basic Rocchio relevance feedback algorithms, and 
adding many terms (up to 500) from the relevant training 
documents o the terms in the topic. The "dortPl" results 
come from using a probabilistically-based r levance feed- 
back instead of the vector-space algorithm. These two 
systems have the best routing results. The "Brkly5" sys- 
tem uses statistical regression on the relevant training doc- 
uments to learn new term weights. The "cityr2" results 
are based on a traditional probabilistic reweighting from 
the relevant documents, adding only a small number of 
new terms (10-25) to the topic. The "INQ003" results ai- 
m use probabilistic reweighting and add 30 new terms to 
the topics. The "hnc2c" results are similar to the HNCrtl 
fusion results for the 24-month TIPSTER evaluation. 
These plots mask important information as they are aver- 
ages over the 50 adhoc or routing topics. Whereas often 
the averages show little difference between systems, these 
systems are performing quite differently when viewed on 
a topic by topic basis. Table 1 shows the "top 8" TREC-2 
systems for each adhoc topic. The various ystem tags il- 
lustrate that a wide variety of systems do well on these 
topics, and that often a system that does not do well on 
average may perform best for a given topic. This is an in- 
herent performance characteristic of information retrieval 
systems, and emphasizes the importance of getting be- 
yond the averages in doing evaluation. Clearly systems 
that perform well on average reflect better overall method- 
ologies, but often much can be learned by analyzing why 
a given system performs well or poorly on a given topic. 
This is where more work is needed with respect to analyz- 
ing the TIPSTER and TREC results. 
Tables 2 and 3 show some prefiminary analysis of two of 
the topics with respect to the TIPSTER contractors. Table 
2 gives the ranks of the relevant documents retrieved ei- 
ther by the HNCrtl run or the INQ023 run. Clearly the 
HNC run is better for this topic, providing much higher 
ranks for most of the relevant documents. Note that five 
of the relevant documents were not retrieved by either 
system. 
Table 3 shows a sfighfly different view of the same phe- 
nomena, but for topic 121. There were a total of 55 rele- 
vant documents for this topic, with only 13 of them found 
by the TIPSTER systems. Table 3 fists those 13 docu- 
ments, the rank at which they were regieved, and the 
"tag" of the system retrieving them. Note that for this top- 
ic the INQUERY system is performing better than the 
HNC system. These tables illustrate the varying perfor- 
mance of different methods across the topics. A major 
challenge facing each group is to determine which strate- 
gies are successful for most topics, and which strategies 
are successful only for some topics (including how to 
identify in advance this topic subse0. 
6. JAPANESE RESULTS 
By the 24-month evaluation, only 7 topics were ready for 
testing. Both TRW and the University of Massachusetts 
ran these topics successfully, and the results are discussed 
in their system evaluations. No comparison of the results 
is possible between the two systems because of the pre- 
liminary nature of having only 7 topics. However, the 
University of Massachusetts (who did both English and 
Japanese) reported that minimal effort was necessary for 
porting their English techniques to Japanese, especially 
given the availability of the JUMAN Japanese word seg- 
mentor. Additionally the new TRW Japanese interface 
was judged a major success by the beta site tests. 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
What are some of the conclusions that can be drawn from 
the many experiments performed in the TIPSTER and 
TREC evaluations, and equally important, what is the last- 
ing value of this two-year project? 
First, the statistical techniques (using non-Boolean meth- 
ods without any formal query language) that were used on 
the smaller test collections DO scale up. The simplest ex- 
ample of this is the consistently high performance of the 
Comell SMART system in TREC. This very basic system 
42 
relies on the vector-space model and on carefully crafted 
term weighting to produce their high results. A more 
complex example of the successful se of statistical tech- 
niques is the University of Massachusetts INQUERY sys- 
tem, which uses the more sophisticated inference network 
approach to achieve their high performance. This system 
has been very successful throughout the TIPSTER pro- 
ject, and has achieved this success using variations on 
their original system rather than having to completely re- 
vise their techniques. 
Second, the results obtained by the best systems in TIP- 
STER and TREC are at a level of performance that is gen- 
erally accepted to be superior to the best current Boolean 
retrieval system. More importantly, this performance is
achieved from simple natural language input, allowing 
consistently superior retrieval performance without ex- 
haustive training or experience. These systems are clearly 
ready to be tested in fully operational environments. 
Third, the use of a large test collection has shown some 
unexpected results. Techniques that should have brought 
improvements have not done so. The use of phrases in- 
stead of single terms has not resulted in significant im- 
provements; the use of proximity or paragraph-level re- 
trieval has not shown especially good results; and the use 
of more complex NLP techniques have not worked well 
yet. Conversely, techniques that have not been successful 
before such as using types of automatic thesaurii for topic 
expansion have had unexpected success. These unexpect- 
ed results using a large test collection are reopening re- 
search on old discarded ideas and starting research in new 
areas. It is much too early to draw firm conclusions on 
any of these techniques. Often poor performance that is 
attributed to one problem may be the result of lack of bal- 
ance in parameter adjustment, e.g., the lack of im- 
provement from phrases may be caused by the difficulty 
in balancing the weights of these phrases and the weights 
of single terms. 
What is the lasting value of the document detection half 
of the TIPSTER phase I project? The first contribution in 
my opinion has been the development of a large test col- 
lection and the wide acceptance of its use via the TREC 
conferences. The lack of a large test collection has been a 
major barrier in the field of information retrieval and its 
removal allows an expansion of research by many groups 
world-wide. 
The second lasting value is the demonstration f the feasi- 
bility of using the non-Boolean, statistically-based re-
trieval systems both in the ARPA community and in the 
broader commercial sector. Not only have well- 
established small-scale research groups braved the scaling 
effort, but at least four new commercial products have 
used the TIPSTER/TREC program as launching pads. 
The TIPSTER program has caused the establishment of 
two major new retrieval research groups; both Syracuse 
University and HNC Inc. have built systems during the 
TIPSTER project hat are approaching the power of the 
best of the TIPSTER/TREC systems. Additionally many 
of the TREC systems are either new groups in the infor- 
marion retrieval research arena or are older groups ex- 
panding their small programs to tackle this major etrieval 
experiment. 
The final lasting value of the TIPSTER project has been 
the joining of the NLP community and the information re- 
trieval (IR) community in the project. This has led to the 
high expecrions for combining these disjoint echnologies 
in phase II and has helped cement the important coUabo- 
ration of two diverse groups of researchers. 
These three lasting contributions are not only of value in- 
dividnally, but will lead to a resurgence of research in the 
information retrieval area. The combination of the large 
test collection, the growing demand for improved retrieval 
products, and the increased collaboration between the 
NLP and IR communities will result in new techniques 
that will finally achieve the breakthrough in performance 
that is TIPSTER's goal.
