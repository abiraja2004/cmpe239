1. Introduction 
The automatic disambiguation of word senses hasbeen an interest and concern since 
the earliest days of computer treatment of language in the 1950s. Sense disambiguation 
is an "intermediate ask" (Wilks and Stevenson 1996), which is not an end in itself, but 
rather is necessary at one level or another to accomplish most natural anguage pro- 
cessing tasks. It is obviously essential for language understanding applications, uch 
as message understanding and man-machine communication; it is at least helpful, and 
in some instances required, for applications whose aim is not language understanding: 
? machine translation: sense disambiguation is essential for the proper 
translation of words such as the French grille, which, depending on the 
context, can be translated as railings, gate, bar, grid, scale, schedule, etc. 
(see, for instance Weaver \[1955\], Yngve \[1955\]). 
? information retrieval and hypertext navigation: when searching for specific 
keywords, it is desirable to eliminate occurrences in documents where 
the word or words are used in an inappropriate sense; for example, 
when searching for judicial references, it is desirable to eliminate 
documents containing the word court as associated with royalty, rather 
than with law (see, for instance, Salton \[1968\], Salton and McGill \[1983\], 
Krovetz and Croft \[1992\], Voorhees \[1993\], Schfitze and Pedersen \[1995\]). 
? content and thematic analysis: a common approach to content and thematic 
analysis is to analyze the distribution of predefined categories of 
words--i.e., words indicative of a given concept, idea, theme, 
etc.--across a text. The need for sense disambiguation i  such analysis, 
in order to include only those instances of a word in its proper sense, has 
long been recognized (see, for instance, Stone et al \[1966\], Stone \[1969\], 
Kelly and Stone \[1975\]; for a more recent discussion see Litowski \[1997\]). 
? grammatical analysis: sense disambiguation is useful for part-of-speech 
tagging for example, in the French sentence L'~tag~re plie sous les livres 
('The shelf is bending under \[the weight of\] the books'), it is necessary to 
disambiguate the sense of livres (which can mean 'books' or 'pounds'

and is masculine in the former sense, feminine in the latter) to properly 
tag it as a masculine noun. Sense disambiguation is also necessary for 
certain syntactic analyses, such as prepositional phrase attachment 
(Jensen and Binot 1987; Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990; Hindle 
and Rooth 1993), and, in general, restricts the space of competing parses 
(Alshawi and Carter 1994). 
speech processing: sense disambiguation is required for correct 
phonetization of words in speech synthesis, for example, the word 
conjure in He conjured up an image or in I conjure you to help me (Sproat, 
Hirschberg, and Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1997), and also for word 
segmentation and homophone discrimination in speech recognition 
(Connine 1990; Seneff 1992). 
text processing: sense disambiguation is necessary for spelling correction 
(for example, to determine when diacritics hould be inserted, such as in 
French, changing comte to comte \[Yarowsky 1994a, 1994b\]); for case 
changes (HE READ THE TIMES ~ He read the Times); for lexical access of 
Semitic languages (in which vowels are not written), etc. 
The problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been described as "AI-complete," 
that is, a problem which can be solved only by first resolving all the difficult problems 
in artificial intelligence (AI), such as the representation f common sense and encyclo- 
pedic knowledge. The inherent difficulty of sense disambiguation was a central point 
in Bar-Hillel's well-known treatise on machine translation (Bar-Hillel 1960), where he 
asserted that he saw no means by which the sense of the word pen in the sentence 
The box is in the pen could be determined automatically. Bar-Hillel's argument laid the 
groundwork for the ALPAC report (ALPAC 1966), which is generally regarded as the 
direct cause for the abandonment of most research on machine translation in the early 
1960s. 
At about the same time, considerable progress was being made in the area of 
knowledge representation, especially the emergence of semantic networks, which were 
immediately applied to sense disambiguation. Work on word sense disambiguation 
continued throughout he next two decades in the framework of AI-based natural 
language understanding research, as well as in the fields of content analysis, stylistic ?
and literary analysis, and information retrieval. In the past ten years, attempts to 
automatically disambiguate word senses have multiplied, due, like much other similar 
activity in the field of computational linguistics, to the availability of large amounts 
of machine-readable text and the corresponding development of statistical methods to 
identify and apply information about regularities in this data. Now that other problems 
amenable to these methods, such as part-of-speech disambiguation and alignment of 
parallel translations, have been fairly thoroughly addressed, the problem of word sense 
disambiguation has taken center stage, and it is frequently cited as one of the most 
important problems in natural anguage processing research today. 
Given the progress that has been recently made in WSD research and the rapid 
development of methods for solving the problem, it is appropriate at this time to stand 
back and assess the state of the field and to consider the next steps that need to be 
taken. To this end, this paper surveys the major, well-known approaches to word sense 
disambiguation and considers the open problems and directions of future research. 
Ide and V4ronis Introduction 
2. Survey of WSD Methods 
In general terms, word sense disambiguation involves the association of a given word 
in a text or discourse with a definition or meaning (sense) which is distinguishable from 
other meanings potentially attributable to that word. The task therefore necessarily 
involves two steps: (1) the determination of all the different senses for every word 
relevant (at least) to the text or discourse under consideration; and (2) a means to 
assign each occurrence of a word to the appropriate sense. 
Much recent work on WSD relies on predefined senses for step (1), including: 
? a list of senses, such as those found in everyday dictionaries; 
? a group of features, categories, or associated words (e.g., synonyms, as in 
a thesaurus); 
? an entry in a transfer dictionary, which includes translations in another 
language; 
The precise definition of a sense is, however, a matter of considerable debate within 
the community. The variety of approaches todefining senses has raised concern about 
the comparability of much WSD work, and given the difficulty of the problem of 
sense definition, no definitive solution is likely to be found soon (see Section 3.2). 
However, since the earliest days of WSD work, there has been general agreement that 
the problems of morpho-syntactic disambiguation a d sense disambiguation can be 
disentangled (see, e.g., Kelly and Stone \[1975\]). That is, for homographs with differ- 
ent parts of speech (e.g., play as a verb and noun), morphosyntactic disambiguation 
accomplishes sense disambiguation, and therefore (especially since the development 
of reliable part-of-speech taggers), WSD work has focused largely on distinguishing 
senses among homographs belonging to the same syntactic ategory. 
Step (2), the assignment of words to senses, is accomplished by reliance on two 
major sources of information: 
? the context of the word to be disambiguated, in the broad sense: this 
includes information contained within the text or discourse in which the 
word appears, together with extra-linguistic information about the text, 
such as situation, etc.; 
? external knowledge sources, including lexical, encyclopedic, etc. resources, 
as well as hand-devised knowledge sources, which provide data useful 
to associate words with senses. 
All disambiguation work involves matching the context of the instance of the word 
to be disambiguated with either information from an external knowledge source 
(knowledge-driven WSD), or information about the contexts of previously disam- 
biguated instances of the word derived from corpora (data-driven or corpus-based 
WSD). Any of a variety of association methods is used to determine the best match 
between the current context and one of these sources of information, in order to as- 
sign a sense to each word occurrence. The following sections urvey the approaches 
applied to date. 
2.1 Early WSD Work in MT 
The first attempts at automated sense disambiguation were made in the context of 
machine translation (MT). In his famous memorandum (available mimeographed in 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
1949, but not printed until 1955) Weaver discusses the need for WSD in machine 
translation and outlines the basis of an approach to WSD that underlies all subsequent 
work on the topic: 
If one examines the words in a book, one at a time as through an 
opaque mask with a hole in it one word wide, then it is obviously 
impossible to determine, one at a time, the meaning of the words . . . .  
But if one lengthens the slit in the opaque mask, until one can see not 
only the central word in question but also say N words on either side, 
then if N is large enough one can unambiguously decide the meaning 
of the central word . . . .  The practical question is: "What minimum 
value of N will, at least in a tolerable fraction of cases, lead to the 
correct choice of meaning for the central word?" (1955, 20) 
A well-known early experiment by Kaplan (1950) attempted to answer this question 
at least in part, by presenting ambiguous words in their original context and in a 
variant context providing one or two words on either side to seven translators. Ka- 
plan observed that sense resolution given two words on either side of the word was 
not significantly better or worse than when given the entire sentence. The same phe- 
nomenon has been reported by several researchers since Kaplan's work appeared: e.g., 
Masterman (1962), Koutsoudas and Korfhage (1956) on Russian, and Gougenheim and 
Mich6a (1961) and Choueka nd Lusignan (1985) on French. 
Reifler's (1955) "semantic oincidences" between a word and its context quickly 
became the determining factor in WSD. The complexity of the context, and in particular 
the role of syntactic relations, was also recognized; for example, Reifler (1955) says: 
Grammatical structure can also help disambiguate, as, for instance, 
the word keep, which can be disambiguated by determining whether 
its object is gerund (He kept eating), adjectival phrase (He kept calm), or 
noun phrase (He kept a record). 
The goal of MT was initially modest, focused primarily on the translation of techni- 
cal texts and in all cases dealing with texts from particular domains. Weaver discusses 
the role of the domain in sense disambiguation, making a point that was reiterated 
several decades later by Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992c): 
In mathematics, to take what is probably the easiest example, one 
can very nearly say that each word, within the general context of a 
mathematical article, has one and only one meaning. (1955, 20) 
Following directly from this observation, much effort in the early days of machine 
translation was devoted to the development of specialized ictionaries or "micro- 
glossaries" (Oswald 1952, 1957; Oswald and Lawson 1953; Oettinger 1955; Dostert 
1955; Gould 1957; Panov 1960). Such microglossaries contain only the meaning of a 
given word relevant for texts in a particular domain of discourse; e.g., a microglossary 
for the domain of mathematics would contain only the relevant definition of triangle, 
and not the definition of triangle as a musical instrument. 
The need for knowledge representation for WSD was also acknowledged from 
the outset: Weaver concludes by noting the "tremendous amount of work \[needed\] in 
the logical structure of languages" (1995, 23). Several researchers attempted to devise 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
an "interlingua" based on logical and mathematical principles that would solve the 
disambiguation problem by mapping words in any language to a common seman- 
tic/conceptual representation. Among these efforts, those of Richens and Masterman 
eventually led to the notion of the "semantic network" (Richens \[1958\], Masterman 
\[1962\]; see Section 2.2.1); following on this, the first machine-implemented knowledge 
base was constructed from Roget's Thesaurus (Masterman 1957). Masterman applied this 
knowledge base to the problem of WSD: in an attempt o translate Virgil's Georgics by 
machine, she looked up, for each Latin word stem, the translation in a Latin-English 
dictionary and then looked up this word in the word-to-head index of Roget's. In 
this way, each Latin word stern was associated with a list of Roget head numbers 
associated with its English equivalents. The numbers for words appearing in the same 
sentence were then examined for overlaps. Finally, English words appearing under 
the multiply-occurring head categories were chosen for the translation. ~ Masterman's 
methodology is strikingly similar to that underlying much of the knowledge-based 
WSD accomplished recently (see Section 2.3). 
It is interesting to note that Weaver's text also outlined the statistical approach to 
language analysis prevalent now, nearly fifty years later: 
This approach brings into the foreground an aspect of the matter that 
probably is absolutely basic--namely, the statistical character of the 
problem ... .  And it is one of the chief purposes of this memorandum 
to emphasize that statistical semantic studies should be undertaken, 
as a necessary primary step. (1955, 22) 
Several authors followed this approach in the early days of machine translation 
(e.g., Richards 1953; Yngve 1955; Parker-Rhodes 1958). Estimations of the degree of 
polysemy in texts and dictionaries were made: Harper, working on Russian texts, 
determined the number of polysemous words in an article on physics to be approx- 
imately 30% (Harper 1957a) and 43% in another sample of scientific writing (Harper 
1957b); he also found that Callaham's Russian-English dictionary provides, on aver- 
age, 8.6 English equivalents for each Russian word, of which 5.6 are quasi-synonyms, 
thus yielding approximately three distinct English equivalents for each Russian word. 
Bel'skaja (1957) reports that in the first computerized Russian dictionary, 500 out of 
2,000 words are polysemous. Pimsleur (1957) introduced the notion of levels of depth 
for a translation: level 1 uses the most frequent equivalent (e.g., German schwer = 
heavy), producing a text where 80% of the words are correctly translated; level 2 dis- 
tinguishes additional meanings (e.g., schwer = difficult), producing a translation which 
is 90% correct; etc. Although the terminology is different, this is very similar to the no- 
tion of baseline tagging used in modern work (see, e.g., Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 
\[1992b\]). 
A convincing implementation of many of these ideas was made several years 
later, paradoxically at the moment when MT began its decline. Madhu and Lytle 
(1965), working from the observation that domain constrains ense, calculated sense 
frequency for texts in different domains and applied a Bayesian formula to determine 
the probability of each sense in a given context--a technique similar to that applied in 
much later work and which yielded a similar 90% correct disambiguation result (see 
Section 2.4). 
1 For a detailed accounting ofMasterman's methodology, see Wilks, Slator, and Guthrie (1996). Other 
researchers have discussed the use of thesauri for disambiguation n the context of early MT work, e.g. 
Gentilhomme and Tabory (1960). 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
The striking fact about this early work on WSD is the degree to which the funda- 
mental problems and approaches to the problem were foreseen and developed at that 
time. However, without large-scale resources, most of these ideas remained untested 
and to a large extent, forgotten, until several decades later. 
2.2 AI-based Methods 
AI methods began to flourish in the early 1960s and began to attack the problem of 
language understanding. As a result, WSD in AI work was typically accomplished in
the context of larger systems intended for full language understanding. In the spirit 
of the times, such systems were almost always grounded in some theory of human 
language understanding that they attempted to model, and often involved the use 
of detailed knowledge about syntax and semantics to perform their task, which was 
exploited for WSD. 
2.2.1 Symbolic Methods. As mentioned above, semantic networks were developed 
in the late 1950s and were immediately applied to the problem of representing word 
meanings. 2 Masterman (1962), working in the area of machine translation, used a se- 
mantic network to derive the representation f sentences in an interlingua comprised 
of fundamental language concepts; sense distinctions are implicitly made by choosing 
representations that reflect groups of closely related nodes in the network. She devel- 
oped a set of 100 primitive concept ypes (THING, DO, etc.), in terms of which her 
group built a 15,000-entry concept dictionary, where concept ypes are organized in 
a lattice with inheritance of properties from superconcepts o subconcepts. Building 
on this and on work on semantic networks by Richens (1958), Quillian (1961, 1962a, 
1962b, 1967, 1968, 1969) built a network that includes links among words (tokens) and 
concepts (types), in which links are labeled with various semantic relations or simply 
indicate associations between words. The network is created starting from dictionary 
definitions, but is enhanced by human knowledge that is hand-encoded. When two 
words are presented to the network, Quillian's program simulates the gradual activa- 
tion of concept nodes along a path of links originating from each input word by means 
of marker passing; disambiguation is accomplished because only one concept node 
associated with a given input word is likely to be involved in the most direct path 
fotmd between the two input words. Quillian's work informed later dictionary-based 
approaches to WSD (see Section 2.3.1). 
Subsequent AI-based approaches exploited the use of frames containing informa- 
tion about words and their roles and relations to other words in individual sentences. 
For example, Hayes (1976, 1977a, 1977b, 1978) uses a combination of a semantic net- 
work and case frames. The network consists of nodes representing noun senses and 
links represented by verb senses; case frames impose IS-A and PART-OF relations 
on the network. As in Quillian's system, the network is traversed to find chains of 
connections between words. Hayes work shows that homonyms can be fairly accu- 
rately disambiguated using this approach, but it is less successful for other kinds 
of polysemy. Hirst (1987) also uses a network of frames and, again following Quil- 
lian, marker passing to find minimum-length paths of association between frames for 
senses of words in context in order to choose among them. He introduces "polaroid 
words," a mechanism which progressively eliminates inappropriate senses based on 
2 Semantic networks derive from much earlier work on knowledge representation using graphs, such as 
Pierce's "existential graphs" (see Roberts \[1973\]) and the graphs of the psychologist Selz (1913, 1922) 
which represent patterns of concepts and inheritance of properties. 
6 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
syntactic evidence provided by the parser, together with semantic relations found in 
the frame network. Eventually only one sense remains; however, Hirst reports that 
in cases where some word (including words other than the target) in the sentence is
used metaphorically, metonymically, or in an unknown sense, the polaroids often end 
by eliminating all possible senses, and fail. 
Wilks' preference semantics (\[1968, 1969, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c, 1975d\]; see the 
survey by Wilks and Fass \[1990\]), which uses Masterman's primitives, is essentially a 
case-based approach to natural language understanding and one of the first specifically 
designed to deal with the problem of sense disambiguation. Preference semantics 
specifies electional restrictions for combinations of lexical items in a sentence that can 
be relaxed when a word with the preferred restrictions does not appear, thus enabling, 
especially, the handling of metaphor (as in My car drinks gasoline, where the restrictions 
on drink prefer an animate subject but allow an inanimate one). Boguraev (1979) shows 
that preference semantics i inadequate odeal with polysemous verbs and attempts to 
improve on Wilks' method by using a combination of evidence, including selectional 
restrictions, preferences, case frames, etc. He integrates semantic disambiguation with 
structural disambiguation to enable judgments about he semantic coherence of a given 
sense assignment. Like many other systems of the era, these systems are sentence- 
based and do not account for phenomena atother levels of discourse, such as topical 
and domain information. The result is that some kinds of disambiguation are difficult 
or impossible to accomplish. 
A rather different approach to language understanding, which contains a sub- 
stantial sense discrimination component, is the Word Expert Parser (Small 1980, 1983; 
Small and Reiger 1982; Adriaens 1986, 1987, 1989; Adriaens and Small 1988). The 
approach derives from the somewhat unconventional theory that human knowledge 
about language is organized primarily as knowledge about words rather than rules. 
Their system models what its authors feel is the human language understanding pro- 
cess: a co-ordination of information exchange among word experts about syntax and 
semantics as each determines its involvement in the environment under question. Each 
expert contains a discrimination net for all senses of the word, which is traversed on 
the basis of information supplied by the context and other word experts, ultimately 
arriving at a unique sense, which is then added to a semantic representation f the 
sentence. The well-known drawback of the system is that the word experts need to 
be extremely large and complex to accomplish the goal, which is admittedly greater 
than sense disambiguation. 3 
Dahlgren's (1988) language understanding system includes a sense disambigua- 
tion component that uses a variety of types of information: fixed phrases, syntac- 
tic information (primarily, selectional restrictions), and commonsense r asoning. The 
reasoning module, because it is computationally intensive, is invoked only in cases 
where the other two methods fail to yield a result. Although her original assumption 
was that much disambiguation could be accomplished based on paragraph topic, she 
found that half of the disambiguation was actually accomplished using fixed phrase 
and syntactic information, while the other half was accomplished using commonsense 
reasoning. Reasoning often involves traversing an ontology to find common ancestors 
for words in context; her work anticipates Resnik's (1993a, 1993b, 1995a) results by 
determining that ontological similarity, involving a common ancestor in the ontology, 
is a powerful disambiguator. She also notices that verb selectional restrictions are an 
3 It is interesting to compare the word experts with the procedures of Kelly and Stone (1975), which 
similarly involve procedures for individual words, although t eir goal was only to disambiguate senses. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
important source of disambiguation i formation for nouns--another result that has 
been subsequently tested and noted. 
2.2.2 Connectionist Methods. Work in psycholinguistics in the 1960s and 1970s estab- 
lished that semantic priming--a process in which the introduction of a certain concept 
will influence and facilitate the processing of subsequently introduced concepts that 
are semantically related--plays a role in disambiguation by humans (see, e.g., Meyer 
and Schvaneveldt \[1971\]). This idea is realized in spreading activation models (see 
Collins and Loftus \[1975\]; Anderson \[1976, 1983\]), where concepts in a semantic net- 
work are activated upon use, and activation spreads to connected nodes. Activation is 
weakened as it spreads, but certain odes may receive activation from several sources 
and be progressively reinforced. McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) added to the model 
by introducing the notion of inhibition among nodes, where the activation of a node 
might suppress, rather than activate, certain of its neighbors (see also Feldman and 
Ballard \[1982\]). Applied to lexical disambiguation, this approach assumes that acti- 
vating a node corresponding to, say, the concept THROW will activate the "physical 
object" sense of ball, whose activation would in turn inhibit the activation of other 
senses of ball, such as "social event." 
Quillian's semantic network, described above, is the earliest implementation f a 
spreading activation etwork used for word sense disambiguation. A similar model 
is implemented by Cottrell and Small (1983); see also Cottrell (1985). In both of these 
models, each node in the network represents a specific word or concept. 4 Waltz and 
Pollack (1985) and Bookman (1987) hand-encode s ts of semantic "microfeatures," cor- 
responding to fundamental semantic distinctions (animate/inanimate, edible/inedible, 
threatening/safe, etc.), characteristic durations of events (second, minute, hour, day, 
etc.), locations (city, country, continent, etc.), and other similar distinctions, in their net- 
works. In Waltz and Pollack (1985), sets of microfeatures have to be manually primed 
by a user to activate a context for disambiguating a subsequent input word, but Book- 
man (1987) describes a dynamic process in which the microfeatures are automatically 
activated by the preceding text, thus acting as a short-term context memory. In ad- 
dition to these local models (i.e., models in which one node corresponds to a single 
concept), distributed models have also been proposed (see, for example, Kawamoto 
\[1988\]). However, whereas local models can be constructed a priori, distributed models 
require a learning phase using disambiguated xamples, which limits their practicality. 
The difficulty of hand-crafting the knowledge sources required for AI-based sys- 
tems restricted them to "toy" implementations handling only a tiny fraction of the 
language. Consequently, disambiguation procedures embedded in such systems are 
most usually tested on only a very small test set in a limited context (most often, a 
single sentence), making it impossible to determine their effectiveness on real texts. 
For less obvious reasons, many of the AI-based disambiguation results involve highly 
ambiguous words and fine sense distinctions (e.g., ask, idea, hand, move, use, work, etc.) 
and unlikely test sentences (The astronomer married the star), which make the results 
even less easy to evaluate in the light of the now-known difficulties of discriminating 
even gross sense distinctions. 
4 Note, however, that, symbolic methods uch as Quillian's implement propagation via mechanisms such 
as marker passing, whereas the neural network models developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s use 
numeric activation, inspired by the neural models of McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and Hebb's (1949) 
work on neurological development, which saw its first full development in Rosenblatt's (1958) 
"perceptrons."

Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
2.3 Knowledge-based Methods 
The AI-based work of the 1970s and 1980s was theoretically interesting but not at all 
practical for language understanding in any but extremely limited domains. A signifi- 
cant roadblock to generalizing WSD work was the difficulty and cost of hand-crafting 
the enormous amounts of knowledge required for WSD: the so-called "knowledge 
acquisition bottleneck" (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993). Work on WSD reached 
a turning point in the 1980s when large-scale lexical resources, such as dictionaries, 
thesauri, and corpora, became widely available. Attempts were made to automatically 
extract knowledge from these sources (Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2) and, more recently, to 
construct large-scale knowledge bases by hand (Section 2.3.3). A corresponding shift 
away from methods based in linguistic theories and towards empirical methods also 
occurred at this time, as well as a decrease in emphasis on do-all systems in favor of 
"intermediate" tasks such as WSD. 
2.3.1 Machine-Readable Dictionaries. Machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) became 
a popular source of knowledge for language-processing tasks following Amsler's 
(1980) and Michiel's (1982) theses. 5 A primary area of activity during the 1980s in- 
volved attempts to automatically extract lexical and semantic knowledge bases from 
MRDs (Michiels, Mullenders, and No61 1980; Calzolari 1984; Chodorow, Byrd, and 
Heidon 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens 1986; Byrd et al 1987; Nakamura 
and Nagao 1988; Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder 1990; Wilks et al 1990). This 
work contributed significantly to lexical semantic studies, but it appears that the ini- 
tial goalmthe automatic extraction of large knowledge bases--was not fully achieved: 
the only currently widely available large-scale lexical knowledge base (WordNet, see 
below) was created by hand. We have elsewhere demonstrated the difficulties of auto- 
matically extracting relations as simple as hyperonymy (V~ronis and Ide 1991; Ide and 
V~ronis 1993a, 1993b), in large part due to the inconsistencies in dictionaries them- 
selves (well-known to lexicographers, cf. Atkins and Levin \[1988\], Kilgarriff \[1994\]) 
as well as the fact that dictionaries are created for human use, and not for machine 
exploitation. 
Despite its shortcomings, the machine-readable dictionary provides a ready-made 
source of information about word senses and therefore rapidly became a staple of 
WSD research. The methods employed attempt o avoid the problems cited above 
by using the text of dictionary definitions directly, together with methods ufficiently 
robust to reduce or eliminate the effects of a given dictionary's inconsistencies. All of 
these methods (and many of those cited elsewhere in this paper) rely on the notion 
that the most plausible sense to assign to multiple co-occurring words is the one that 
maximizes the relatedness among the chosen senses. 
Lesk (1986) created a knowledge base that associated with each sense in a dictio- 
nary a "signature "6 composed of the list of words appearing in the definition of that 
sense. Disambiguation was accomplished by selecting the sense of the target word 
whose signature contained the greatest number of overlaps with the signatures of 
neighboring words in its context. The method achieved 50-70% correct disambigua- 
tion, using a relatively fine set of sense distinctions uch as those found in a typical 
learner's dictionary. Lesk's method is very sensitive to the exact wording of each deft-

Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary, typed from printed versions under the 
direction of Olney and Ziff of the System Development Corporation in 1966-68 (Olney 1968). Urdang 
(1984) describes a similar enterprise during the same period at Random House.

nition: the presence or absence of a given word can radically alter the results. However, 
Lesk's method has served as the basis for most subsequent MRD-based disambigua- 
tion work. 
Wilks et al (1990) attempted to improve the knowledge associated with each sense 
by calculating the frequency of co-occurrence for the words in definition texts, from 
which they derive several measures of the degree of relatedness among words. This 
metric is then used with the help of a vector method that relates each word and its 
context. In experiments on a single word (bank), the method achieved 45% accuracy on 
sense identification, and 90% accuracy on homograph identification. Lesk's method has 
been extended by creating a neural network from definition texts in the Collins English 
Dictionary (CED), in which each word is linked to its senses, which are themselves 
linked to the words in their definitions, which are in turn linked to their senses, etc. 
(V6ronis and Ide 1990). 7 Experiments on 23 ambiguous words, each in six contexts 
(138 pairs of words), produced correct disambiguation, using the relatively fine sense 
distinctions in the CED, in 71.7% of the cases (three times better than chance: 23.6%) 
(Ide and V6ronis 1990b); in later experiments, improving the parameters and only 
distinguishing homographs enabled a rate of 85% (vs. chance: 39%) (V6ronis and Ide 
1995). Applied to the task of mapping the senses of the CED and OALD for the same 23 
words (59 senses in all), this method obtained a correct correspondence in 90% of the 
cases at the sense level, and 97% at the level of homographs (Ide and V6ronis 1990a). 
Sutcliffe and Slater (1995) replicated this method on full text (samples from Orwell's 
Animal Farm) and found similar results (72% correct sense assignment, compared with 
a 33% chance baseline, and 40% using Lesk's method). 
Several authors (for example, Krovetz and Croft \[1989\], Guthrie et al \[1991\], Sla- 
tor \[1992\], Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie \[1992\], Janssen \[1992\], Braden-Harder \[1993\], 
Liddy and Paik \[1993\]) have attempted to improve results by using supplementary 
fields of information in the electronic version of the Longman Dictionary of Contempo- 
rary English (LDOCE), in particular, the box codes and subject codes provided for 
each sense. Box codes include primitives such as ABSTRACT, ANIMATE, HUMAN, 
etc., and encode type restrictions on nouns and adjectives and on the arguments of 
verbs. Subject codes use another set of primitives to classify senses of words by sub- 
ject (ECONOMICS, ENGINEERING, etc.). Guthrie et al (1991) demonstrate a typical 
use of this information: in addition to using the Lesk-based method of counting over- 
laps between definitions and contexts, they impose a correspondence of subject codes 
in an iterative process. No quantitative valuation of this method is available, but 
Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie (1992) improve the method using simulated anneal ing 
and report results of 47% for sense distinctions and 72% for homographs. The use 
of LDOCE box codes, however, is problematic: the codes are not systematic (see, for 
example, Fontenelle \[1990\]); in later work, Braden-Harder (1993) showed that simply 
matching box or subject codes is not sufficient for disambiguation. For example, in I 
tipped the driver, the codes for several senses of the words in the sentence satisfy the 
necessary constraints (e.g., tip-money +human object or tip-tilt + movable solid object). 
7 Note that the assumptions underlying this method are very similar to Quillian's (1968): 
Thus one may think of a full concept analogically as consisting of all the information one 
would have if he looked up what will be called the "patriarch" word in a dictionary, then 
looked up every word in each of its definitions, then looked up every word found in each of 
these, and so on, continually branching outward... (p. 238). 
However, Quillian's network also keeps track of semantic relationships among the words encountered 
along the path between two words, which are encoded in his semantic network; the neural network 
avoids the overhead of creating the semantic network but loses this relational information. 
10 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
In many ways, the supplementary information in the LDOCE, and in particular the 
subject codes, is similar to that in a thesaurus, which, however, is more systematically 
structured. 
Inconsistencies in dictionaries, noted earlier, are not the only and perhaps not 
the major source of their limitations for WSD. While dictionaries provide detailed 
information at the lexical level, they lack pragmatic information that enters into sense 
determination (see, e.g., Hobbs \[1987\]). For example, the link between ash and tobacco, 
cigarette, or tray in a network such as Quillian's is very indirect, whereas in the Brown 
corpus, the word ash co-occurs frequently with one of these words. It is therefore not 
surprising that corpora have become a primary source of information for WSD; this 
development is outlined below in Section 2.3. 
2.3.2 Thesauri. Thesauri provide information about relationships among words, most 
notably synonymy. Roget's International Thesaurus, which was put into machine-tractable 
form in the 1950s and has been used in a variety of applications including machine 
translation (Masterman 1957), information retrieval (Sparck-Jones 1964, 1986), and con- 
tent analysis (Sedelow and Sedelow \[1969\], see also Sedelow and Sedelow \[1986, 1992\]), 
also supplies an explicit concept hierarchy consisting of up to eight increasingly re- 
fined levels/Typically, each occurrence of the same word under different categories of 
the thesaurus represents different senses of that word; i.e., the categories correspond 
roughly to word senses (Yarowsky 1992). A set of words in the same category are 
semantically related. 
The earliest known use of Roget's for WSD is the work of Masterman (1957), 
described above in Section 2.1. Several years later, Patrick (1985) used Roget~ to dis- 
criminate among verb senses, by examining semantic lusters formed by "e-chains" 
derived from the thesaurus (Bryan \[1973, 1974\]; see also Sedelow and Sedelow \[1986\]). 
He uses "word-strong neighborhoods," comprising word groups in low-level semi- 
colon groups, which are the most closely related semantically in the thesaurus, and 
words connected to the group via chains. He is able, he claims, to discriminate the 
correct sense of verbs such as inspire (to raise the spirits vs. to inhale, breathe in, sniff, 
etc.), and question (to doubt vs. to ask a question) with high reliability. Bryan's earlier 
work had already demonstrated that homographs can be distinguished by applying a 
metric based on relationships defined by his chains (Bryan 1973, 1974). Similar work 
is described in Sedelow and Mooney (1988). 
Yarowsky (1992) derives classes of words by starting with words in common cat- 
egories in Roget's (4th edition). A 100-word context of each word in the category is 
extracted from a corpus (the 1991 electronic text of Grolier's Encyclopedia), nd a mutual- 
information-like statistic is used to identify words most likely to co-occur with the 
category members. The resulting classes are used to disambiguate new occurrences 
of a polysemous word: the 100-word context of the polysemous occurrence is exam- 
ined for words in various classes, and Bayes' Rule is applied to determine the class 
most likely to be that of the polysemous word. Since class is assumed by Yarowsky to 
represent a particular sense of a word, assignment to a class identifies the sense. He 
reports 92% accuracy on a mean three-way sense distinction. Yarowsky notes that his 
method is best for extracting topical information, which is in turn most successful for 
disambiguating nouns (see Section 3.1.2). He uses the broad category distinctions up- 
plied by Roget's, although e points out that the lower-level information may provide 
8 The work of Masterman (1957) and Sparck-Jones (1964) relied on a version of Roget's that was 
hand-punched onto cards in the 1950s; the Sedelows' (1969) work relied on a machine-readable version 
of the 3rd edition. Roget's i now widely available via anonymous ftp from various ites. 
11

rich information for disambiguation. Patrick's much earlier study, on the other hand, 
exploits the lower levels of the concept hierarchy, in which words are more closely 
related semantically, aswell as connections among words within the thesaurus itself; 
however, despite its promise this work has not been built upon since. 
Like machine-readable dictionaries, a thesaurus i a resource created for humans 
and is therefore not a source of perfect information about word relations. It is widely 
recognized that the upper levels of its concept hierarchy are open to disagreement 
(although this is certainly true for any concept hierarchy), and that they are so broad as 
to be of little use in establishing meaningful semantic ategories. Nonetheless, thesauri 
provide a rich network of word associations and a set of semantic categories potentially 
valuable for language-processing work; however, Roget's and other thesauri have not 
been used extensively for WSD.  9 
2.3.3 Computational Lexicons. In the mid-1980s, work began on the construction of 
large-scale knowledge bases by hand, for example, WordNet (Miller et al 1990; Fell- 
baum forthcoming-a), CyC (Lenat and Guha 1990), ACQUILEX (Briscoe 1991), COM- 
LEX (Grishman, Macleod, and Meyers 1994; Macleod, Grishman, and Myers, forthcom- 
ing). There exist two fundamental pproaches tothe construction of semantic lexicons: 
the enumerative approach, wherein senses are explicitly provided, and the generative 
approach, in which semantic information associated with given words is underspec- 
ified, and generation rules are used to derive precise sense information (Fellbaum, 
forthcoming-b). 
Enumerative L xicons. Among enumerative l xicons, WordNet (Miller et al 1990; Fell- 
baum, forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b) is at present he best-known and the most uti- 
lized resource for word sense disambiguation in English. WordNet versions for several 
western and eastern European languages are currently under development (Vossen, 
forthcoming; Sutcliffe et al, An Interactive Approach, 1996, Sutcliffe et al, IWNR, 1996). 
WordNet combines the features of many of the other resources commonly ex- 
ploited in disambiguation work: it includes definitions for individual senses of words 
within it, as in a dictionary; it defines "synsets" of synonymous words represent- 
ing a single lexical concept, and organizes them into a conceptual hierarchy, l? like 
a thesaurus; and it includes other links among words according to several semantic 
relations, including hyponymy/hyperonymy, antonymy, and meronymy. As such, it 
currently provides the broadest set of lexical information i  a single resource. Another, 
possibly more compelling, reason for WordNet's widespread use is that it is the first 
broad-coverage lexical resource that is freely and widely available; as a result, what- 
ever its limitations, WordNet's ense divisions and lexical relations are likely to impact 
the field for several years to come. 11 
Some of the earliest attempts to exploit WordNet for sense disambiguation are in 
the field of information retrieval. Using the hyponomy links for nouns in WordNet, 
Voorhees (1993) defines aconstruct called a hood in order to represent sense categories, 
much as Roget's categories are used in the methods outlined above. A hood for a given 
word w is defined as the largest connected subgraph that contains w. For each content 
9 Other thesauri have been used for WSD, e.g., the German Hallig-Wartburg (see Schmidt \[1988, 1991\]) 
and the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) (Chen and Chang, this volume). 
10 Note that the structure is not a perfect hierarchy since some of the synsets have more than one parent. 
11 A recent workshop to set up common evaluations mechanisms for word sense disambiguation 
acknowledged the fact that, due to its availability, WordNet is, at present, the most used lexical 
resource for disambiguation i English, and therefore determined that WordNet senses hould form the 
basis for a common sense inventory (Kilgarriff 1997). 
12 
Ide and Vdronis Introduction 
word in a document collection, Voorhees computes the number of times each synset 
appears above that word in the WordNet noun hierarchy, which gives a measure of the 
expected activity (global counts); she then performs the same computation for words 
occurring in a particular document or query (local counts). The sense corresponding 
to the hood root for which the difference between the global and local counts is the 
greatest is chosen for that word. Her results, however, indicate that her technique is
not a reliable method for distinguishing WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions. In a 
similar study, Richardson and Smeaton (1994) create aknowledge base from WordNet's 
hierarchy and apply a semantic similarity function (developed by Resnik--see below) 
to accomplish disambiguation, also for the purposes of information retrieval. They 
provide no formal evaluation but indicate that their results are "promising." 
Sussna (1993) computes a semantic distance metric for each of a set of input text 
terms (nouns) in order to disambiguate hem. He assigns weights based on the relation 
type (synonymy, hyperonymy, etc.) to WordNet links, and defines a metric that takes 
account of the number of arcs of the same type leaving a node and the depth of a 
given edge in the overall "tree." This metric is applied to arcs in the shortest path 
between odes (word senses) to compute semantic distance. The hypothesis i that 
for a given set of terms occurring near each other in a text, choosing the senses that 
minimize the distance among them selects the correct senses. SuSsna's disambiguation 
results are demonstrated to be significantly better than chance. His work is particularly 
interesting because it is one of the few to date that utilizes not only WordNet's IS-A 
hierarchy, but other relational links as well. 
Resnik (1995a) draws on his body of earlier work on WordNet, in which he ex- 
plores a measure of semantic similarity for words in the WordNet hierarchy (Resnik 
1993a, 1993b, 1995a). He computes the shared information content of words, which 
is a measure of the specificity of the concept hat subsumes the words in the Word- 
Net IS-A hierarchy--the more specific the concept hat subsumes two or more words, 
the more semantically related they are assumed to be. Resnik contrasts his method of 
computing similarity to those which compute path length (e.g., Sussna 1993), arguing 
that the links in the WordNet axonomy do not represent uniform distances (cf. Resnik 
1995b). Resnik's method, applied using WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions and 
measured against the performance ofhuman judges, approaches human accuracy. Like 
the other studies cited here, his work considers only nouns. 
WordNet is not a perfect resource for word sense disambiguation. The most fre- 
quently cited problem is the fine-grainedness of WordNet's ense distinctions, which 
are often well beyond what may be needed in many language-processing applications 
(see Section 3.2). Voorhees' (1993) hood construct isan attempt to access ense distinc- 
tions that are less fine-grained than WordNet's ynsets, and less coarse-grained than 
the 10 WordNet noun hierarchies; Resnik's (1995a) method allows for detecting sense 
distinctions at any level of the WordNet hierarchy. However, it is not clear what the 
desired level of sense distinction should be for WSD (or if it is the same for all word 
categories, all applications, etc.), or if this level is even captured in WordNet's hier- 
archy. Discussion within the language-processing community is beginning to address 
these issues, including the most difficult one of defining what we mean by "sense" 
(see Section 3.2). 
Generative Lexicons. Most WSD work to date has relied upon enumerative s nse distinc- 
tions as found in dictionaries. However, there has been recent work on WSD which has 
exploited generative l xicons (Pustejovsky 1995), in which related senses (i.e., system- 
atic polysemy, as opposed to homonymy) are not enumerated but rather are generated 
from rules that capture regularities in sense creation, as for metonymy, meronymy, etc. 
13 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
As outlined in Buitelaar (1997), sense disambiguation i the generative context starts 
with a semantic tagging that points to a complex knowledge representation reflecting 
all of a word's systematically related senses, after which semantic processing may de- 
rive a discourse-dependent interpretation containing more precise sense information 
about the occurrence. Buitelaar (1997) describes the use of CORELEX for underspeci- 
fled semantic tagging (see also Pustejovsky, Boguraev, and Johnston \[1995\]). 
Viegas, Mahesh, and Nirenburg (forthcoming) describe a similar approach to WSD 
undertaken i  the context of their work on machine translation (see also Mahesh et al 
\[1997\] and Mahesh, Nirenburg, and Beale \[1997\]). They access a large syntactic and se- 
mantic lexicon that provides detailed information about constraints, uch as selectional 
restrictions, for words in a sentence, and then search a richly connected ontology to 
determine which senses of the target word best satisfy these constraints. They report 
a success rate of 97%. Like CORELEX, both the lexicon and the ontology are manually 
constructed, and therefore still limited, although much larger than the resources used 
in earlier work. However, Buitelaar (1997) describes means to automatically generate 
CORELEX entries from corpora in order to create domain-specific semantic lexicons, 
thus demonstrating the potential to access larger-scale resources of this kind. 
2.4 Corpus-based Methods 
2.4.1 Growth, Decline, and Re-emergence of Empirical Methods. Since the end of 
the nineteenth century, the manual analysis of corpora has enabled the study of words 
and graphemes (Kaeding 1897-1898, Estoup 1902, Zipf 1935) and the extraction of lists 
of words and collocations for the study of language acquisition or language teaching 
(Thorndike 1921; Fries and Traver 1940; Thorndike and Lorge 1938, 1944; Gougenheim 
et al 1956; etc.). Corpora have been used in linguistics since the first half of the 
twentieth century (e.g., Boas 1940; Fries 1952). Some of this work concerns word senses, 
and it is often strikingly modern: for example, Palmer (1933) studied collocations in 
English; Lorge (1949) computed sense frequency information for the 570 most common 
English words; Eaton (1940) compared the frequency of senses in four languages; 
and Thorndike (1948) and Zipf (1945) determined that there is a positive correlation 
between the frequency and the number of synonyms of a word, the latter of which is 
an indication of semantic richness (the more polysemous a word, the more synonyms 
it has). 
A corpus provides a bank of samples that enable the development of numerical 
language models, and thus the use of corpora goes hand-in-hand with empirical meth- 
ods. Although quantitative/statistical methods were embraced in early MT work, in 
the mid-1960s interest in statistical treatment of language waned among linguists due 
to the trend toward the discovery of formal linguistic rules sparked by the theories 
of Zellig Harris (1951) and bolstered most notably by the transformational theories 
of Noam Chomsky (1957). 12 Instead, attention turned toward full linguistic analysis 
and hence toward sentences rather than texts, and toward contrived examples and 
artificially limited domains instead of general anguage. During the following 10 to 
12 Not all linguists completely abandoned the empirical approach at this time; consider, for instance, 
Pendergraft's (1967) comment: 
It would be difficult, indeed, in the face of today's activity, not to acknowledge the triumph 
of the theoretical pproach, more precisely, of formal rules as the preferred successor of 
lexical and syntactic search algorithms in linguistic description. At the same time, common 
sense should remind us that hypothesis-making is not the whole of science, and that 
discipline will be needed if the victory is to contribute more than a haven from the rigors of 
experimentation (p. 313). 
14 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
15 years, only a handful of linguists continued to work with corpora, most often 
for pedagogical or lexicographic ends (e.g., Quirk 1960; Mich6a 1964). Despite this, 
several important corpora were developed uring this period, including the Brown 
Corpus (Kucera and Francis 1967), the Tr~sor de la Langue Fran?aise (Imbs 1971), and the 
Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB) corpus (Johansson 1980). In the area of natural anguage 
processing, the ALPAC report (1966) recommended intensification of corpus-based re- 
search for the creation of broad-coverage rammars and lexicons, but because of the 
shift away from empiricism, little work was done in this area until the 1980s. Until 
then, the use of statistics for language analysis was almost the exclusive property of 
researchers in the fields of literary and humanities computing, information retrieval, 
and the social sciences. Within these fields, work on WSD continued, most notably 
in the Harvard "disambiguation project" for content analysis (Stone et al 1966; Stone 
1969), and also in the work of Iker (1974, 1975), Choueka and Dreizin (1976) and 
Choueka and Goldberg (1979). 
In the context of the shift away from the use of corpora and empirical methods, 
the work of Weiss (1973) and Kelley and Stone (1975) on the automatic extraction of 
knowledge for word sense disambiguation seems especially innovative. Weiss (1973) 
demonstrated that disambiguation rules can be learned from a manually sense-tagged 
corpus. Despite the small size of his study (five words, a training set of 20 sentences 
for each word, and 30 test sentences for each word), Weiss's results are encouraging 
(90% correct). Kelley and Stone's (1975) work, which grew out of the Harvard "disam- 
biguation project" for content analysis, is on a much larger scale; they extract KWIC 
concordances for 1,800 ambiguous words from a corpus of a half-million words. The 
concordances serve as a basis for the manual creation of disambiguation rules ("word 
tests") for each sense of the 1,800 words. The tests--also very sophisticated for the 
time examine the target word context for clues on the basis of collocational infor- 
mation, syntactic relations with context words, and membership in common semantic 
categories. Their rules perform even better than Weiss's, achieving 92% accuracy for 
gross homographic sense distinctions. 
In the 1980s, interest in corpus linguistics was revived (see, for example, Aarts 
\[1990\] and Leech \[1991\]). Advances in technology enabled the creation and storage of 
corpora larger than had been previously possible, enabling the development of new 
models most often utilizing statistical methods. These methods were rediscovered first 
in speech processing (e.g., Jelinek \[1976\]; see the overview by Church and Mercer \[1993\] 
and the collection of reprints by Waibel and Lee \[1990\]) and were immediately applied 
to written language analysis (e.g., in the work of Bahl and Mercer \[1976\], Debili \[1977\], 
etc.). For a discussion, see Ide and Walker (1992). 
In the area of word sense disambiguation, Black (1988) developed a model based 
on decision trees using a corpus of 22 million tokens, after manually sense-tagging ap- 
proximately 2,000 concordance lines for five test words. Since then, supervised learn- 
ing from sense-tagged corpora has since been used by several researchers: Zernik 
(1990, 1991), Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Gale, Church, and 
Yarowsky (1992d, 1993), Bruce and Wiebe (1994), Miller et al (1994), Niwa and Nitta 
(1994), Lehman (1994), among others. However, despite the availability of increas- 
ingly large corpora, two major obstacles impede the acquisition of lexical knowledge 
from corpora: the difficulties of manually sense-tagging a training corpus, and data 
sparseness. 
2.4.2 Automatic Sense-Tagging. Manual sense-tagging of a corpus is extremely costly, 
and, at present, very few sense-tagged corpora are available. Several efforts to create 
sense-tagged corpora have been or are being made: the Linguistic Data Consortium 
15 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
distributes a corpus of approximately 200,000 sentences from the Brown Corpus and 
the Wall Street Journal in which all occurrences of 191 words are hand-tagged with their 
WordNet senses (see Ng and Lee \[1996\]). Also, the Cognitive Science Laboratory at 
Princeton has undertaken the hand-tagging of 1,000 words from the Brown Corpus 
with WordNet senses (Miller et al 1993) (so far, 200,000 words are available via ftp), 
and hand-tagging of 25 verbs in a small segment of the Wall Street Journal (12,925 
sentences), is also underway (Wiebe et al 1997). However, these corpora re far smaller 
than those typically used with statistical methods. 
Several efforts have been made to automatically sense-tag a training corpus via 
bootstrapping methods. Hearst (1991) proposed an algorithm (CatchWord) that in- 
cludes a training phase during which each occurrence of a set of nouns to be dis- 
ambiguated is manually sense-tagged in several occurrences. 13 Statistical information 
extracted from the context of these occurrences i  then used to disambiguate other oc- 
currences. If another occurrence can be disambiguated with certitude, the system auto- 
matically acquires additional statistical information from these newly disambiguated 
occurrences, thus improving its knowledge incrementally. Hearst indicates that an 
initial set of at least 10 occurrences i necessary for the procedure, and that 20 or 
3{) occurrences are necessary for high precision. This overall strategy is more or less 
that of most subsequent work on bootstrapping. Recently, a class-based bootstrapping 
method for semantic tagging in specific domains has been proposed (Basili et al 1997). 
Sch~tze (1992, 1993) proposes amethod that avoids tagging each occurrence in the 
training corpus. Using letter fourgrams within a 1,001-character window, his method, 
building on the vector-space model from information retrieval (see Salton, Wong, and 
Yang \[1975\]), automatically clusters the words in the text (each target word is rep- 
resented by a vector); a sense is then assigned manually to each cluster, rather than 
to each occurrence. Assigning a sense demands examining 10 to 20 members of each 
cluster, and each sense may be represented by several clusters. This method reduces 
the amount of manual intervention but still requires the examination of a hundred 
or so occurrences for each ambiguous word. A more serious issue for this method is 
that it is not clear what the senses derived from the clusters correspond to (see, for 
example Pereira, Tishby, and Lee \[1993\]); moreover, the senses are not directly usable 
by other systems, since they are derived from the corpus itself. 
Brown et al (1991) and Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, (1992a, 1993) propose the 
use of bilingual corpora to avoid hand-tagging of training data. Their premise is that 
different senses of a given word often translate differently in another language (for 
example, pen in English is stylo in French for its 'writing implement' sense, and en- 
clos for its 'enclosure' sense). By using a parallel aligned corpus, the translation of 
each occurrence of a word such as pen can be used to automatically determine its 
sense. This method has some limitations, ince many ambiguities are preserved in the 
target language (e.g., French souris--English mouse); furthermore, the few available 
large-scale parallel corpora are very specialized (for example, the Hansard corpus of 
Canadian Parliamentary Debates), which skews the sense representation. 14 Dagan, Itai, 
and Schwall (1991) and Dagan and Itai (1994) propose a similar method, but instead of 
a parallel corpus use two monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary. This solves, 
in part, the problems of availability and specificity of domain that plague the parallel 
corpus approach, since monolingual corpora, including corpora from diverse domains 
and genres, are much easier to obtain than parallel corpora. 
13 This study involves only nouns. 
14 For example, Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1993) remark that it is difficult to find any sense other than 
the financial sense for the word bank in the Hansard corpus. 
16 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
Other methods attempt o avoid entirely the need for a tagged corpus, such as 
many of those cited in the section below (e.g., Yarowsky \[1992\] who attacks both the 
tagging and data sparseness problems imultaneously). However, it is likely that, as 
noted for grammatical tagging (M6rialdo 1994), even a minimal phase of supervised 
learning improves radically on the results of unsupervised methods. Research into 
means to facilitate and optimize tagging is ongoing; for example, an optimization 
technique called committee-based sample selection has recently been proposed (En- 
gelson and Dagan 1996), which, based on the observation that a substantial portion 
of manually tagged examples contribute little to performance, nables avoiding the 
tagging of examples that carry more or less the same information. Such methods are 
promising, although to our knowledge they have not been applied to the problem of 
lexical disambiguation. 
2.4.3 Overcoming Data Sparseness. The problem of data sparseness, which is common 
for much corpus-based work, is especially severe for work in WSD. First, enormous 
amounts of text are required to ensure that all senses of a polysemous word are 
represented, given the vast disparity in frequency among senses. For example, in the 
Brown Corpus (one million words), the relatively common word ash occurs only eight 
times, and only once in its sense as tree. The sense ashes = remains of cremated body, 
although common enough to be included in learner's dictionaries such as the LDOCE 
and the OALD, does not appear, and it would be nearly impossible to find the dozen 
or so senses in many everyday dictionaries such as the CED. In addition, the many 
possible co-occurrences for a given polysemous word are unlikely to be found in even 
a very large corpus, or they occur too infrequently to be significant. 15
Smoothing is used to get around the problem of infrequently occurring events, 
and in particular to ensure that non-observed events are not assumed to have a prob- 
ability of zero. The best-known smoothing methods are that of Turing-Good (Good 
1953), which hypothesizes a binomial distribution of events, and that of Jelinek and 
Mercer (1985), which combines estimated parameters on distinct subparts of the train- 
ing corpus. 16 However, these methods do not enable distinguishing between events 
with the same frequency, such as the ash-cigarette and ash-room example given in foot- 
note 15. Church and Gale (1991) have proposed a means to improve methods for 
the estimation of bigrams, which could be extended to co-occurrences: they take into 
account he frequency of the individual words that compose the bigram and make 
the hypothesis that each word appears independently of the others. However, this 
hypothesis contradicts hypotheses of disambiguation based on co-occurrence, which 
rightly assume that some associations are more probable than others. 
Class-based models attempt o obtain the best estimates by combining observa- 
tions of classes of words considered to belong to a common category. Brown et al 
(1992), Pereira and Tishby (1992), and Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) propose meth- 
ods that derive classes from the distributional properties of the corpus itself, while 
other authors use external information sources to define classes: Resnik (1992) uses 
the taxonomy of WordNet; Yarowsky (1992) uses the categories of Roget's Thesaurus, 
Slator (1992) and Liddy and Paik (1993) use the subject codes in the LDOCE; Luk 
(1995) uses conceptual sets built from the LDOCE definitions. Class-based methods 
answer in part the problem of data sparseness and eliminate the need for pretagged 
15 For example, ina window of five words to each side of the word ash in the Brown corpus, commonly 
associated words uch asfire, cigar, volcano, etc., do not appear. The words cigarette and tobacco co-occur 
with ash only once, with the same frequency aswords uch as room, bubble, and house. 
16 See the survey of methods inChen and Goodman (1996). 
17 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
data. However, there is some information loss with these methods because the hy- 
pothesis that all words in the same class behave in a similar fashion is too strong. 
For example, residue is a hypernym of ash in WordNet; its hyponyms form the class 
{ash, cotton(seed) cake, dottle}. Obviously the members of this set of words behave very 
differently in context: volcano is strongly related to ash, but has little or no relation to 
the other words in the set. 
Similarity-based methods Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993, Dagan, Pereira, 
and Lee 1994, and Grishman and Sterling 1993 exploit the same idea of grouping 
observations for similar words, but without regrouping them into fixed classes. Each 
word has a potentially different set of similar words. Like many class-based meth- 
ods, such as Brown et al (1992), similarity-based methods exploit a similarity metric 
between patterns of co-occurrence. Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993) give the 
following example: the pair (chapter, describes) does not appear in their corpus; how- 
ever, chapter is similar to book, introduction, and section, which are paired with describes 
in the corpus. On the other hand, the words similar to book are books, documentation, 
and manuals (see their Figure 1). Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch's (1993) evaluation 
seems to show that similarity-based methods perform better than class-based methods. 
Karov and Edelman (this volume) propose an extension to similarity-based methods 
by means of an iterative process at the learning stage, which gives results that are 
92% accurate on four test words--approximately thesame as the best results cited in 
the literature to date. These results are particularly impressive given that the training 
corpus contains only a handful of examples for each word, rather than the hundreds 
of examples required by most methods. 
3. Open Problems 
We have already noted various problems faced in current WSD research related to 
specific methodologies. Here, we discuss issues and problems that all approaches to 
WSD must face and suggest some directions for further work. 
3.1 The Role of Context 
Context is the only means to identify the meaning of a polysemous word. Therefore, 
all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of the target word to provide 
information to be used for its disambiguation. For data-driven methods, context also 
provides the prior knowledge with which current context is compared to achieve 
disambiguation. 
Broadly speaking, context is used in two ways: 
Bag-of-words approach: context is considered as words in some window 
surrounding the target word, regarded as a group without consideration 
for their relationships to the target in terms of distance, grammatical 
relations, etc. 
Relational information: context is considered in terms of some relation to 
the target, including distance from the target, syntactic relations, 
selectional preferences, orthographic properties, phrasal collocation, 
semantic ategories, etc. 
Information from microcontext, topical context, and domain contributes to sense 
selection, but the relative roles and importance of information from the different con- 
texts, and their interrelations, are not well understood. Very few studies have used 
18 
Ide and V4ronis Introduction 
information of all three types, and the focus in much recent work is on microcontext 
alone. This is another area where systematic study is needed for WSD. 
3.1.1 Microcontext. Most disambiguation work uses the local context of a word occur- 
rence as a primary information source for WSD. Local or "micro" context is generally 
considered to be some small window of words surrounding a word occurrence in a 
text or discourse, from a few words of context o the entire sentence in which the 
target word appears. 
Context is very often regarded as all words or characters falling within some 
window of the target, with no regard for distance, syntactic structure, or other elations. 
Early corpus-based work, such as that of Weiss (1973) used this approach; spreading 
activation and dictionary-based approaches also do not usually differentiate context 
input on any basis other than occurrence in a window. Schtitze's vector space method 
(this volume) is a recent example of an approach that ignores adjacency information. 
Overall, the bag-of-words approach as been shown to work better for nouns than 
for verbs (cf. Schtitze, this volume), and to be in general less effective than methods 
that take other relations into consideration. However, as demonstrated in Yarowsky's 
(1992) work, the approach is cheaper than those requiring more complex processing 
and can achieve sufficient disambiguation for some applications. We examine below 
some of the other parameters. 
Distance.  It is obvious from the quotation in Section 2.1 from Weaver's memorandum 
that the notion of examining a context of a few words around the target o disam- 
biguate has been fundamental toWSD work since its beginnings: it has been the basis 
of WSD work in MT, content analysis, AI-based disambiguation, and dictionary-based 
WSD, as well as the more recent statistical, neural network, and symbolic machine 
learning, approaches. However, following Kaplan's early experiments (Kaplan 1950), 
there have been few systematic attempts to answer Weaver's question concerning the 
optimal value of N. A notable xception is the study of Choueka nd Lusignan (1985), 
who verified Kaplan's finding that 2-contexts are highly reliable for disambiguation, 
and even 1-contexts are reliable in 8 out of 10 cases. However, despite these findings, 
the value of N has continued to vary over the course of WSD work more or less 
arbitrarily. 
Yarowsky (1993, 1994a, 1994b) examines different windows of microcontext, in- 
cluding 1-contexts, k-contexts, and words pairs at offsets -1 and -2, -1 and +1, and 
+1 and +2, and sorts them using a log-likelihood ratio to find the most reliable evi- 
dence for disambiguation. Yarowsky makes the observation that the optimal value of 
k varies with the kind of ambiguity: he suggests that local ambiguities need only a 
window of k = 3 or 4, while semantic or topic-based ambiguities require a larger win- 
dow of 20-50 words (see Section 3.1.2). No single best measure is reported, suggesting 
that for different ambiguous words, different distance relations are more efficient. Fur- 
thermore, because Yarowsky also uses other information (such as part of speech), it 
is difficult o isolate the impact of window-size alone. Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller 
(this volume) use a local window of ?3 open-class words, arguing that this number 
showed best performance in previous tests. 
Col locat ion.  The term "collocation" has been used variously in WSD work. The term 
was popularized by J. R. Firth in his 1951 paper "Modes of meaning": "One of 
the meanings of ass is its habitual collocation with an immediately preceding you 
s i l ly  . . . .  " He emphasizes that collocation is not simple co-occurrence but is "habitual" 
19 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
or "usual. ''17 Halliday's (1961) definition of collocation as "the syntagmatic association 
of lexical items, quantifiable, textually, as the probability that there will occur at n 
removes (a distance of n lexical items) from an item x, the items a, b, c . . ."  is more 
workable in computational terms. 
Based on this definition, a significant collocation can be defined as a syntagmatic 
association among lexical items, where the probability of item x co-occurring with 
items a, b, c . . .  is greater than chance (Berry-Rogghe 1973). It is in this sense that most 
WSD work uses the term. There is some psychological evidence that collocations are 
treated ifferently from other co-occurrences. For example, Kintsch and Mross (1985) 
show that priming words that enter frequent collocations with test words (i.e., iron-steel, 
which they call associative context) activate these test words in lexical decision tasks. 
Conversely, priming words that are in the thematic ontext (i.e., relations determined 
by the situation, scenario, or script such as plane-gate) do not facilitate the subjects' 
lexical decisions (see also Fischler \[1977\], Seidenberg et al \[1982\], De Groot \[1983\], 
Lupker \[1984\]). 
Yarowsky (1993) explicitly addresses the use of collocations in WSD work, but 
admittedly adapts the definition to his purpose as "the co-occurrence of two words in 
some defined relation." As noted above, he examines a variety of distance relations, but 
also considers adjacency by part of speech (e.g., first noun to the left). He determines 
that in cases of binary ambiguity, there exists one sense per collocation, that is, in a 
given collocation, a word is used with only one sense with 90-99% probability. 
Syntactic Relations. Earl (1973) used syntax exclusively for disambiguation in machine 
translation. In most WSD work to date, syntactic information is used in conjunction 
with other information. The use of selectional restrictions weighs heavily in AI-based 
work that relies on full parsing, frames, semantic networks, the application of se- 
lectional preferences, etc. (Hayes 1977a, 1997b; Wilks 1973 and 1975b; Hirst 1987). 
In other work, syntax is combined with frequent collocation information: Kelley and 
Stone (1975), Dahlgren (1988), and Atkins (1987) combine collocation information with 
rules for determining, for example, the presence or absence of determiners, pronouns, 
noun complements, aswell as prepositions, ubject-verb and verb-object relations. 
More recently, researchers have avoided complex processing by using shallow or 
partial parsing. In her disambiguation work on nouns, Hearst (1991) segments text 
into noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and verb groups, and discards all other syn- 
tactic information. She examines items that are within i3  phrase segments from the 
target and combines yntactic evidence with other kinds of evidence, such as capital- 
ization. Yarowsky (1993) determines various behaviors based on syntactic ategory; for 
example, that verbs derive more disambiguating information from their objects than 
from their subjects, adjectives derive almost all disambiguating information from the 
nouns they modify, and nouns are best disambiguated by directly adjacent adjectives 
or nouns. In recent work, syntactic information most often is simply part of speech, 
used invariably in conjunction with other kinds of information (McRoy 1992; Bruce 
and Wiebe 1994; Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller, this volume). 
Evidence suggests that different kinds of disambiguation procedures are needed 
depending on the syntactic ategory and other characteristics of the target word 
(Yarowsky 1993; Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller, this volume)--an idea reminiscent 
of the word expert approach. However, to date there has been little systematic study 
17 Later, several ttempts were made to define the term more precisely inthe framework ofmodern 
linguistic theory. See, for example, Haas (1966), Halliday (1961, 1966), Lyons (1966), McIntosh (1966), 
Sinclair (1966), van Buren (1967).

Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
of the contribution of different information types for different ypes of target words. 
It is likely that this is a next necessary step in WSD work. 
3.1.2 Topical Context. Topical context includes ubstantive words that co-occur with 
a given sense of a word, usually within a window of several sentences. Unlike micro- 
context, which has played a role in disambiguation work since the early 1950s, topical 
context has been less consistently used. Methods relying on topical context exploit 
redundancy in a text--that is, the repeated use of words that are semantically related 
throughout a text on a given topic. Thus, base is ambiguous, but its appearance in a 
document containing words such as pitcher, and ball is likely to isolate a given sense 
for that word (as well as the others, which are also ambiguous). Work involving topical 
context ypically uses the bag-of-words approach, in which words in the context are 
regarded as an unordered set. 
The use of topical context has been discussed in the field of information retrieval 
for several years (Anthony 1954; Salton 1968). Recent WSD work has exploited topical 
context: Yarowsky (1992) uses a 100-word window, both to derive classes of related 
words and as context surrounding the polysemous target, in his experiments using 
Roget's Thesaurus (see Section 2.3.2). Voorhees, Leacock, and Towell (1995) experiment 
with several statistical methods using a two-sentence window; Leacock, Towell, and 
Voorhees (1993, 1996) have similarly explored topical context for WSD. Gale, Church, 
and Yarowsky (1993), looking at a context of ?50 words, indicate that while words clos- 
est to the target contribute most to disambiguation, they improved their results from 
86% to 90% by expanding context from ?6 (a typical span when only microcontext is 
considered) to ~50 words around the target. In a related study, they make a claim that 
for a given discourse, ambiguous words are used in a single sense with high probability 
("one sense per discourse") (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992c). Leacock, Chodorow, 
and Miller (this volume) challenge this claim in their work combining topical and 
local context, which shows that both topical and local context are required to achieve 
consistent results across polysemous words in a text (see also Towell and Voorhees, 
this volume). Yarowsky's (1993) study indicates that while information within a large 
window can be used to disambiguate nouns, for verbs and adjectives the size of the 
usable window drops off dramatically with distance from the target word. This sup- 
ports the claim that both local and topical context are required for disambiguation, 
and points to the increasingly accepted notion that different disambiguation methods 
are appropriate for different kinds of words. 
Methods utilizing topical context can be ameliorated by dividing the text under 
analysis into subtopics. The most obvious way to divide a text is by sections (Brown 
and Yule 1983), but this is only a gross division; subtopics evolve inside sections, often 
in unified groups of several paragraphs. Automatic segmentation f texts into such 
units would obviously be helpful for WSD methods that use topical context. It has been 
noted that the repetition of words within successive segments or sentences i  a strong 
indicator of the structure of discourse (Skorochod'ko 1972; Morris 1988; Morris and 
Hirst 1991); methods exploiting this observation to segment a text into subtopics are 
beginning to emerge (see, for example, Hearst \[1994\], van der Eijk \[1994\], Richmond, 
Smith, and Amitay \[1997\]). 
In this volume, Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller consider the role of microcontext 
vs. topical context and attempt to assess the contribution of each. Their results indicate 
that for a statistical c assifier, microcontext is superior to topical context as an indicator 
of sense. However, although a distinction is made between microcontext and topical 
context in current WSD work, it is not clear that this distinction is meaningful. It may 
be more useful to regard the two as lying along a continuum, and to consider the role 
21 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
and importance of contextual information as a function of distance from the target. 
3.1.3 Domain. The use of domain for WSD is first evident in the microglossaries 
developed in early MT work (see Section 2.1). The notion of disambiguating senses 
based on domain is implicit in various AI-based approaches, uch as Schank's cript 
approach to natural anguage processing (Schank and Abelson 1977), which matched 
words to senses based on the context or "script" activated by the general topic of 
the discourse. This approach, which activates only the sense of a word relevant o the 
current discourse domain, demonstrates its limitations of this approach when used in 
isolation; in the famous example The lawyer stopped at the bar for a drink, the incorrect 
sense of bar will be assumed if one relies only on the information in a script concerned 
with law. TM 
Gale, Church, and Yarowsky's (1992c) claim for one sense per discourse is dis- 
putable. Dahlgren (1988) observes that domain does not eliminate ambiguity for some 
words: she remarks that the noun hand has 16 senses (or so) and retains 10 of them 
in almost any text. The influence of domain likely depends on factors such as the 
type of text (how technical the text is, etc.), the relation among the senses of the target 
word (strongly or weakly polarized, common vs. specialized usage, etc.). For example, 
in the French Encyclopaedia Universalis, the word intdrOt ("interest") appears 62 times 
in the article on INTEREST--FINANCE, in all cases in its financial sense; the word 
appears 139 times in the article INTEREST--PHILOSOPHY AND HUMANITIES in 
its common, nonfinancial, sense. However, in the article THIRD WORLD, the word 
int~r~t appears two times in each of these senses. 
3.2 Sense D iv is ion  
3.2.1 The Bank Model. Most researchers in WSD are currently relying on the sense 
distinctions provided by established lexical resources, uch as machine-readable dictio- 
naries or WordNet (which uses the OALD's senses), because they are widely available. 
The dominant model in these studies is the "bank" model, which attempts to extend 
the clear delineation between bank-money and bank-riverside to all sense distinctions. 
However, it is clear that this convenient delineation is by no means applicable to all 
or even most other words. Although there is some psychological validity to the notion 
of senses (Simpson and Burgess 1988; Jorgensen 1990), lexicographers themselves are 
well aware of the lack of agreement on senses and sense divisions (see, for example, 
Malakhovski \[1987\], Robins \[1987\], Ayto \[1983\], Stock \[1983\]). The problem of sense 
division has been an object of discussion since antiquity: Aristotle 19 devoted a section 
of his Topics to this subject in 350 B.C. Since then, philosophers and linguists have con- 
tinued to discuss the topic at length (see Quine \[1960\], Asprejan \[1974\], Lyons \[1977\], 
Weinrich \[1980\], Cruse \[1986\]), but the lack of resolution over 2,000 years is striking. 
3.2.2 Granularity. One of the foremost problems for WSD is to determine the appropri- 
ate degree of sense granularity. Several authors (for example, Slator and Wilks \[1987\]) 
have remarked that the sense divisions one finds in dictionaries are often too fine 
for the purposes of NLP work. Overly fine sense distinctions create practical difficul- 
18 An interesting development based on Schank's approach is described in Granger (1977), where he 
utilizes information in scripts and conceptual dependency representations of entences todetermine 
the meaning of entirely unknown words encountered in text. The approach, which examines domain 
and contextual evidence to determine meaning, is similar to that employed in much AI-based work on 
disambiguation. 
19 One of the reviewers for this special issue remarked humorously that if Aristotle had had a PC, he 
would have probably worked on word sense disambiguation! 
22 
Ide and VOronis Introduction 
ties for automated WSD: they introduce significant combinatorial effects (for example, 
Slator and Wilks \[1987\] note that the sentence There is a huge envelope of air around the 
surface of the earth has 284,592 different potential combined sense assignments using 
the moderately-sized LDOCE); they require making sense choices that are extremely 
difficult, even for expert lexicographers; and they increase the amount of data required 
for supervised methods to unrealistic proportions. In addition, the sense distinctions 
made in many dictionaries are sometimes beyond those which human readers them- 
selves are capable of making. In a well-known study, Kilgarriff (1992, 1993) shows 
that it is impossible for human readers to assign many words to a unique sense in 
LDOCE (see, however, the discussion in Wilks \[forthcoming\]). Recognizing this, Dolan 
(1994) proposes a method for "ambiguating" dictionary senses by combining them to 
create grosser sense distinctions. Others have used the grosser sense divisions of the- 
sauri such as Roget's; however, it is often difficult to assign a unique sense, or even 
find an appropriate one among the options (see, for example, Yarowsky \[1992\]). Chen 
and Chang (this volume) propose an algorithm that combines enses in a dictionary 
(LDOCE) and links them to the categories of a thesaurus (LLOCE). 
Combining dictionary senses does not solve the problem. First of all, the degree 
of granularity required is task dependent. Only homograph distinction is necessary 
for tasks such as speech synthesis or restoration of accents in text, while tasks such 
as machine translation require fine sense distinctions--in some cases finer than what 
monolingual dictionaries provide (see, for example, ten Hacken \[1990\]). For example, 
the English word river is translated as fleuve in French when the river flows into the 
ocean, and otherwise as rivi~re. There is not, however, a strict correspondence b tween 
a given task and the degree of granularity required. For example, as noted earlier, the 
word mouse, although it has two distinct senses (animal, device), translates into French 
in both cases to souris. On the other hand, for information retrieval the distinction 
between these two senses of mouse is important, whereas it is difficult to imagine 
a reason to distinguish river (sense yqeuve) - river (sense rivi~re). Second, and more 
generally, it is unclear when senses hould be combined or split. Even lexicographers 
do not agree: Fillmore and Atkins (1991) identify three senses of the word risk but find 
that most dictionaries fail to list at least one of them. In many cases, meaning is best 
considered as a continuum along which shades of meaning fall (see, for example, Cruse 
\[1986\]), and the points at which senses are combined or split can vary dramatically. 
3.2.3 Senses or usages? The Aristotelian idea that words correspond to specific objects 
and concepts was displaced in the twentieth century by the ideas of Saussure and 
others (Meillet \[1926\], Hjemslev \[1953\], Martinet \[1960\], etc.). For Antoine Meillet, for 
example, the sense of a word is defined only by the average of its linguistic uses. 
Wittgenstein takes a similar position in his Philosophische Utersuchungen 2? in asserting 
that there are no senses, but only usages: 
"For a large class of cases--though not for all--in which we employ 
the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is 
its use in the language" (1953, Sect. 43). 
Similar views are apparent in more recent heories of meaning, for example, Bloomfield 
(1933) and Harris (1954), for whom meaning is a function of distribution; and in 
Barwise and Perry's (1953) situation semantics, where the sense or senses of a word 
are seen as an abstraction of the role that it plays systematically in the discourse. 
20 Note that Wittgenstein had first defended the Aristotelian view in his Tractatus. 
23 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
The COBUILD project (Sinclair 1987) adopts this view of meaning by attempting 
to anchor dictionary senses in current usage by creating sense divisions on the basis 
of clusters of citations in a corpus. Atkins (1987) and Kilgarriff (forthcoming) also 
implicitly adopt the view of Harris (1954), according to which each sense distinction 
is reflected in a distinct context. A similar view underlies the class-based methods 
cited in Section 2.4.3 (Brown et al 1992; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and 
Lee 1993). In this volume, Schiitze continues in this vein and proposes a technique 
that avoids the problem of sense distinction altogether: he creates ense clusters from 
a corpus rather than relying on a pre-established sense list. 
3.2.4 Enumerat ion or generation? The development of generative lexicons (Puste- 
jovsky 1995) provides a view of word senses that is very different from that of almost 
all WSD work to date. The enumerative approach assumes an a priori, established 
set of senses that exist independent of context--fundamentally the Aristotelian view. 
The generative approach develops a discourse-dependent representation f sense, as- 
suming only underspecified sense assignments until context is taken into account, and 
bears closer relation to distributional nd situational views of meaning. 
Considering the difficulties of determining an adequate and appropriate set of 
senses for WSD, it is surprising that little attention has been paid to the potential of 
the generative view in WSD research. As larger and more complete generative l xicons 
become available, there is merit to exploring this approach to sense assignment. 
3.3 Evaluation 
Given the variety in the studies cited throughout the previous urvey, it is obvious 
that it is very difficult to compare one set of results, and consequently one method, 
with another. The lack of comparability results from substantial differences in test 
conditions from study to study. For instance, different ypes of texts are involved, 
including both highly technical or domain-specific texts where sense use is limited 
and general texts where sense use may be more variable. It has been noted that in 
a commonly used corpus such as the Wall Street Journal, certain senses of typical test 
words such as line are absent entirely. 21When different corpora containing different 
sense inventories and very different levels of frequency for a given word and/or sense 
are used, it becomes futile to attempt to compare results. 
Test words themselves differ from study to study, including not only words whose 
assignment toclearly distinguishable s nses varies considerably orwhich exhibit very 
different degrees of ambiguity (e.g., bank vs. line), but also words across different parts 
of speech and words that tend to appear more frequently in metaphoric, metonymic, 
and other nonliteral usages (e.g., bank vs. head). More seriously, the criteria for eval- 
uating the correctness of sense assignment vary. Different studies employ different 
degrees of sense granularity (see Section 3.2 above), ranging from identification of 
homographs to fine sense distinctions. In addition, the means by which correct sense 
assignment is finally judged are typically unclear. Human judges must ultimately de- 
cide, but the lack of agreement among human judges is well documented: Amsler and 
White (1979) indicate that while there is reasonable consistency in sense assignment 
for a given expert on successive sense assignments (84%), agreement is significantly 
lower among experts. Ahlswede (1995) reports between 63.3% and 90.2% agreement 
among judges on his Ambiguity Questionnaire; when faced with on-line sense assign- 
21 For example, the common sense of line as in the sentence, Hegave me a line of bologna, is not present in
the Wall Street Journal corpus. 
24 
Ide and V~ronis Introduction 
ment in a large corpus, agreement among judges is far less, and in some cases worse 
than chance (see also Ahlswede \[1992, 1993\], Ahlswede and Lorand \[1993\]). Jorgensen 
(1990) found the level of agreement in her experiment using data from the Brown 
Corpus to be about 68%. 
The difficulty of comparing results in WSD research as recently become a concern 
within the community, and efforts are underway to develop strategies for evaluation 
of WSD. Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992b) attempt o establish lower and upper 
bounds for evaluating the performance ofWSD systems; their proposal for overcoming 
the problem of agreement among human judges in order to establish an upper bound 
provides a starting point, but it has not been widely discussed or implemented. A 
recent discussion at a workshop sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on the 
Lexicon (SIGLEX) on "Evaluating Automatic SemanticTaggers" (Resnik and Yarowsky 
\[1997a\[; see also Resnik and Yarowsky \[1997b\], Kilgarriff \[1997\]) has sparked the forma- 
tion of an evaluation effort for WSD (SENSEVAL), in the spirit of previous evaluation 
efforts such as the ARPA-sponsored Message Understanding Conferences (e.g., ARPA 
\[1993\]), and Text Retrieval Conferences (e.g. Harman \[1993, 1995\]). SENSEVAL will see 
its first results at a subsequent SIGLEX workshop to be held at Herstmonceux Castle, 
England in September, 1998. 
As noted above, WSD is not an end in itself but rather an "intermediate ask" that 
contributes to an overall task such as information retrieval or machine translation. This 
opens the possibility of two types of evaluation for WSD work (using terminology bor- 
rowed from biology): in vitro evaluation, where WSD systems are tested independent 
of a given application, using specially constructed benchmarks; and evaluation in vivo, 
where, rather than being evaluated in isolation, results are evaluated in terms of their 
contribution to the overall performance of a system designed for a particular applica- 
tion, such as machine translation. 
3.3.1 Evaluation In Vitro. In vitro evaluation, despite its artificiality, enables close 
examination of the problems plaguing a given task. In its most basic form, this type 
of evaluation (also called variously performance evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson 
\[1996\]; assessment: Bimbot, Chollet, and Paoloni \[1994\]; or declarative valuation: Arnold, 
Sadler, and Humphreys \[1993\]) involves comparison of the output of a system for a 
given input, using measures such as precision and recall. SENSEVAL currently envis- 
ages this type of evaluation for WSD results. Alternatively, in vitro evaluation can focus 
on study of the behavior and performance of systems on a series of test suites repre- 
senting the range of linguistic problems likely to arise in attempting WSD (diagnostic 
evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson \[1996\]; or typological evaluation: Arnold, Sadler, 
and Humphreys 1993). Considerably deeper understanding of the factors involved 
in the disambiguation task is required before appropriate test suites for typological 
evaluation of WSD results can be devised. Basic questions uch as the role of part 
of speech in WSD, the treatment of metaphor, metonymy, and the like in evaluation, 
and how to deal with words of differing degrees and types of polysemy, must first 
be resolved. SENSEVAL will likely take us a step closer to this understanding; at the 
least, it will force consideration of what can be meaningfully regarded as an isolatable 
sense distinction and provide some measure of the distance between the performance 
of current systems and a predefined standard. 
The in vitro evaluation envisaged for SENSEVAL demands the creation of a man- 
ually sense-tagged reference corpus containing an agreed-upon set of sense distinc- 
tions. The difficulties of attaining sense agreement, even among experts, have already 
been outlined. Resnik and Yarowsky (1997b) have proposed that for WSD evaluation, 
25 
Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 
it may be practical to retain only those sense distinctions that are lexicalized cross- 
linguistically. This proposal has the merit of being immediately usable, but in view 
of the types of problems cited in the previous section, systematic study of interlan- 
guage relations will be required to determine its viability and generality. At present, 
the apparent best source of sense distinctions is assumed to be on-line resources uch 
as LDOCE or WordNet, although the problems of utilizing such resources are well 
known, and their use does not address issues of more complex semantic tagging that 
goes beyond the typical distinctions made in dictionaries and thesauri. 
Resnik and Yarowsky (1997b) also point out that a binary evaluation (correct/incor- 
rect) for WSD is not sufficient, and propose that errors be penalized according to a 
distance matrix among senses based on a hierarchical organization. For example, fail- 
ure to identify homographs of bank (which would appear higher in the hierarchy) 
would be penalized more severely than failure to distinguish bank as an institution 
from bank as a building (which would appear lower in the hierarchy). However, de- 
spite the obvious appeal of this approach, it runs up against the same problem of 
the lack of an established, agreed-upon hierarchy of senses. Aware of this problem, 
Resnik and Yarowsky suggest creating the sense distance matrix based on results in 
experimental psychology such as Miller and Charles (1991) or Resnik (1995b). Even 
ignoring the cost of creating such a matrix, the psycholinguistic literature has made 
clear that these results are highly influenced by experimental conditions and the task 
imposed on the subjects (see, for example, Tabossi \[1989, 1991\], Rayner and Morris 
\[1991\]); in addition, it is not clear that psycholinguistic data can be of help in WSD 
aimed toward practical use in NLP systems. 
In general, WSD evaluation confronts difficulties of criteria that are similar to, 
but orders of magnitude greater than, those facing other tasks such as part-of-speech 
tagging, due to the elusive nature of semantic distinctions. It may be that at best we 
can hope to find practical solutions that will serve particular needs; this is considered 
more fully in the next section. 
3.3.2 Evaluation In Vivo. Another approach to evaluation is to consider esults inso- 
far as they contribute to the overall performance in a particular application, such as 
machine translation, information retrieval, or speech recognition. This approach (also 
called adequacy evaluation: Hirschman and Thompson \[1996\]; or operational evaluation: 
Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys \[1993\]), although it does not assure the general appli- 
cability of a method nor contribute to a detailed understanding of problems, does not 
demand agreement on sense distinctions or the establishment of a pretagged corpus. 
Only the final result is taken into consideration, subjected to evaluation appropriate 
to the task at hand. 
Methods for WSD have evolved largely independently of particular applications, 
especially in the recent past. It is interesting to note that few, if any, systems for 
machine translation have incorporated recent methods developed for WSD, despite the 
importance of WSD for MT noted by Weaver almost 50 years ago. The most obvious 
effort to incorporate WSD methods into larger applications i in the field of information 
retrieval, and the results are ambiguous: Krovetz and Croft (1992) report only a slight 
improvement in retrieval using WSD methods; Voorhees (1993) and Sanderson (1994) 
indicate that retrieval degrades if disambiguation is not sufficiently precise. Sparck- 
Jones (forthcoming) questions the utility of any NLP technique for document retrieval. 
On the other hand, Sch~tze and Pedersen (1995) show a marked improvement in 
retrieval (14.4%) using a method that combines earch-by-word and search-by-sense. 
It remains to be seen to what extent WSD can improve results in particular ap- 
26 
Ide and V4ronis Introduction 
plications. However, if meaning is largely a function of use, it may be that the only 
relevant evaluation of WSD results is achievable in the context of specific tasks. 
4. Summary and Conclusion 
Work on automatic WSD has a history as long as automated language processing 
generally. Looking back, it is striking to note that most of the problems and the basic 
approaches to solving them were recognized at the outset. Since so much of the early 
work on WSD is reported in relatively obscure books and articles across several fields 
and disciplines, it is not surprising that recent authors are often unaware of it. What 
is surprising is that in the broad sense, relatively little progress eems to have been 
made in nearly 50 years. Even though much recent work cites results at the 90% level 
or better, these studies typically involve very few words, most often only nouns, and 
frequently concern only broad sense distinctions. 
In a sense, WSD work has come full circle, returning most recently to empirical 
methods and corpus-based analyses that characterize some of the earliest attempts to 
solve the problem. With sufficiently greater esources and enhanced statistical methods 
at their disposal, researchers in the 1990s have obviously improved on earlier results, 
but it appears that we may nearly have reached the limit of what can be achieved 
in the current framework. For this reason, it is especially timely to assess the state of 
WSD and consider, in the context of its entire history, the next directions of research. 
This paper is an attempt o provide that context, at least in part, by bringing WSD 
into the perspective of the past 50 years of work on the topic. While we are aware 
that much more could be added to what is presented here, we have made an attempt 
to cover at least the major areas of work and sketch the broad lines of development 
in the field. 22 
Of course, WSD is problematic in part because of the inherent difficulty of deter- 
mining or even defining word sense, and this is not an issue that is likely to be solved 
in the near future. Nonetheless, it seems clear that current WSD research could benefit 
from a more comprehensive consideration of theories of meaning and work in the 
area of lexical semantics. One of the obvious stumbling blocks in much recent WSD 
work is the rather narrow view of sense that comes hand-in-hand with the attempt 
to use sense distinctions in everyday dictionaries, which cannot, and are not intended 
to, represent meaning in context. A different sort of view, one more consistent with 
current linguistic theory, is required; here, we see the recent work using generative 
lexicons as providing at least a point of departure. 
Another goal of this paper is to provide a starting point for the growing number 
of researchers working in various areas of computational linguistics who want to learn 
about WSD. There is renewed interest in WSD as it contributes to various applications, 
such as machine translation and document retrieval. WSD as "intermediate task," 
while interesting in its own right, is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to 
assess in the abstract; incorporation of WSD methods into larger applications will 
therefore hopefully inform and enhance future work. 
Finally, if a lesson is to be learned from a review of the history of WSD, it is that 
research can be very myopic and, as a result, tends to revisit many of the same issues 
over time. This is especially true when work on a problem has been cross-disciplinary. 
There is some movement oward more merging of research from various areas, at 
22 There are several important topics we have not been able to treat except in a cursory way, including 
lexical semantic theory, work in psycholinguistics, and statistical methods and results from literary and 
linguistic analysis. 
27

least as far as language processing is concerned, spurred by the practical problems of 
information access that we are facing as a result of rapid technological development. 
Hopefully, this will contribute to further progress on WSD.
