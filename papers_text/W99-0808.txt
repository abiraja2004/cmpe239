Abstract 
A computer-based course addressing the 
topic of" applying Natural Language 
resources and techniques to Information 
Retrieval is presented. The course 
provides several Internet on-line 
resources to support a learning by doing 
approach in a real world context. 
Rationale for the design of the course is 
presented and a detailed description of 
the course structure and content is given. 
1 Introduction 
There are two traditional distinctions in higher 
education that are currently on a period of big 
debate. The first one concerns industrial training 
vs higher education objectives, the second one is 
related to the role of emerging technologies for 
distance learning, potentially blurring the until 
now clear separation between conventional 
universities and distance learning Institutions. 
Changes in both Education and Training 
contexts are moving closer their previously 
separate objectives. On one hand, there is much 
concern about bringing educational curricula 
more in line with vocational needs. In a variety 
of disciplines, higher education courses are 
becoming oriented to professionally recognized 
qualifications, adopting approaches to integrate 
practice in context. On the other hand, industrial 
organizations are looking for a more versatile 
way of building personal profiles to adapt 
individuals to the changing needs of their 
organizations. Thus, acquiring more general 
skill is been increasingly addressed for advanced 
training purposes. 
Distance learning Universities are operating 
since the seventies. Most of them were based on 
the industrial model characterized by the 
production of highly effective learning materials 
for independent s udy and the use of "one-way" 
media, such as print, video, radio or TV 
broadcasting. While in traditional education the 
cost of education depends on the number of 
students involved, this is not the case with the 
industrial distance education model. The cost 
depends on a fixed part for the preparation of 
materials with less investment in academic staff 
for tutoring tasks. A clear improvement of using 
new technology for this model has been the 
delivery of course materials through CD-ROM, 
and later on through the Internet. Computer- 
based materials can integrate presentations with 
simulations, problem solving tools, virtual 
laboratories and the like, to engage students in a 
process of active learning. More controversial 
is the embedding of human-human i teractive 
technologies. It is an open challenge to find new 
ways of satisfying increasing interaction 
between students and tutors when staff 
resources remain scarce. Peer collaboration is an 
idea to explore, but as it is the case in many 
industrial organizations collaborative behavior 
does not happen spontaneously just because the 
technology is available, but rather is a shift of 
culture to be established. 
The virtual campus \[1\] is a metaphor currently 
deserving a lot of attention. It is sometimes 
presented as a bridge for conventional 
universities tO extend their scope to reach 
distance learners, sometimes as an opportunity 
for distance learning institutions to provide an 
environment combining the strength of 
systematic teaching with elaborated materials to 
support more!efficiently distance study. But 
metaphors hould be carefully contrasted with 
the demand side perspective to foresee whether 
technology-baged distance teaching can succeed. 
For example, 'there is, despite the quite short 
history of desl~top computer conferencing, some 
failed pilot experiences in real-time multipoint 
teleteaching. The cost of equipment was a well- 
known factor,, but another very practical issue 
was often neglected: real distance students are 
in fact fully reluctant o participate regularly in 
synchronous events, with a fixed schedule. The 
existing technology has demonstrated to be 
powerful. Payilng due regard to usability issues 
in order to realize its potential for learning 
purposes remains an open question. 
Over the last decade the European Commission 
has launched a variety of programs to encourage 
international partnership and cooperation in the 
field of education and training. Some of the 
programs aimed at analyzing the current 
situation to recommend future action. Others 
were projects trongly technology oriented to 
develop platforms and environments specially 
focused on distance and flexible learning. In 
addition, a Set of pilot experiences and 
applications were also implemented. 
Within the :SOCRATES framework \[2\], 
ACO*HUM \[3\] is a thematic network including 
a working group on Computational linguistics 
and language ngineering. A plan for developing 
open distance learning pilot courses was 
proposed in cooperation with ELSNET \[4\], and 
finally a proposal including six pilots was 
launched in February 98. We have developed 
one of them, on the topic of Information 
Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) \[5\]. 
This topic is! especially well suited for a 
learning-by-doing web course. The Internet 
itself is the biggest IR testbed, and the web 
search engines are the most powerful 
applications of IR techniques. The students can 
be guided through on-line NLP software to 
manipulate, expand, translate queries, etc., and 
get first hand impressions on the utility of such 
processes. 
Next section discusses our approach while a 
detailed presentation is given in section three. 
2 Approach and aims 
The approach for developing our project has 
been to capture the experience of designing 
materials from the distance teaching tradition, 
while embracing two principles of recent 
learning theories in the support of both 
education and training: (i) learning by doing, 
and (ii) situated learning. The first addresses 
how to acquire knowledge \[6\] and the latter 
highlights the ability to deploy knowledge in 
real world context \[7\]. Some of the assumptions 
we consider follows: 
A first essential component of our approach is to 
provide structured access to a set of tools and 
learning resources, both internal and external to 
the site. 
In order to deploy the strategy of learning-by- 
doing, students are required to perform tasks for 
each main issue. These tasks are designed to 
encourage lots of practical work situating the 
learning experience as close to the real world as 
possible. 
A second component is to help the learner to be 
introduced in a professional community. In this 
respect we would pay special attention to 
establish for all actors (researchers, teachers, 
professionals and students) concrete ways to 
collaborate fruitfully in the evolution and 
updating of the product. This is a quite 
important aspect in an emerging field where 
changes come quite rapidly. 
A third component is to enable the learner or 
trainee to became engaged in a learning 
community, breaking the feeling of being 
isolated. Social support and participation 
improve learners' motivation: facilities for 
shared virtual spaces and personal 
communication would be included. 
A fourth component relates to our strong 
endorsement of the role of collaboration. A 
culture of collaboration eeds to be developed. 
To explore the potential of group learning we 
would provide means for developing 
collaborative activities using asynchronous 
technology. This would be applicable in 
contexts where stable small groups of learners 
could be organized. 
Based on the above argumentation the project 
aims are listed below: 
? To develop a computer-based course 
? addressing the topic of applying Natural 
Language resources and techniques to 
Information Retrieval or, to be more 
accurate, Text Retrieval, dealing with 
multilinguality issues. 
? providing or assembling Internet on- 
line resources that permit a practical 
experimentation f the issues considered 
in the course. Such facilities can be in- 
site software, including: Stemmers, 
Morphological Analysers, Part of 
Speech Taggers for different languages, 
Multilingual Lexical Databases, Cross- 
Language Mapping of Queries or 
external, public domain resources uch 
as Internet Retrieval Engines, Machine 
Translation Systems, etc. 
? To design a structured web-based site 
? allowing single learning on-line mode, 
and asynchronous collaboration mode 
? offering guidelines to support 
independent learners 
? providing an interface to facilitate 
flexible access to the content matter and 
the rest of the tools and resources 
? To involve colleagues in contributing to 
current and further development of the 
prototype 
The remaining sections of the paper describe 
how the background ideas have been articulated 
and embedded in the design of the prototype, 
further testing with users, as well as the internal 
evaluation and dissemination plan. 
3 Key features of the IR-NLP 
web site. 
Figure 1 shows the Web Site Homepage. The 
layout is homogeneous through the site: on the 
left appears the set of available options, on the 
right the contents for the selected function. 
There are two different menus: one for the 
Homepage, the other for the Contents of the 
course. 
The Homepage menu (see figure 1) offers 
General Information and Communication 
Services, and provide access to the contents of 
the course. General Information is structured in 
five sections: Using this site, Introduction, 
Syllabus outline, Requirements and Study Guide. 
As an example, Introduction gives answers to 
the following questions: (i) What is this course 
about? (ii) What will you not find here? (iii) In 
which ways can the site be exploited for 
learning purposes? Communication services 
integrate e-mail facilities with a directory of 
contacts. In addition, News will be provided 
here. It also holds room for a Frequently-Asked- 
Questions list where answers to common 
problems related to the course will be build and 
enriched with the contribution of users. 
The Contents button provides access to the main 
page of the course. The Contents menu (see 
Figure 3) contains the following functions:

examples and interactive xercises. Information 
is now mainly hyper-textual with links to a 
reading list of: references and the glossary. A 
self-test, that. ican be filled interactively and 
submitted for evaluation to obtain feedback, is 
also included for each chapter. Each exercise 
has a didactic description in terms of the 
following featu:res: 
? Estimated workload: Gives an 
estimation of the time needed to solve 
the exercise. 
? Difficulty level: three levels are 
considered, easy, medium and difficult. 
? Learning Objectives: a description of 
the main purpose of the exercise, either 
in terms of knowledge or skills. 
? Character: either Recommended or 
Optional. 
? Media needed: Paper&pencil, Software 
(provided by our site), or Links to 
external sources. 
? Solution: One of these three 
possibilities: (i) The solution is directly 
available (ii) A method to check the 
solution is provided (iii) Questions to 
think about he results are provided. 
Figure 2 shows one of the exercises for the 
Information Retrieval chapter. 
Study Guide - offers didactic support to carry 
out a distance self study of the Contents. For 
each chapter, the following items are included: 
(i) A list of the main concepts/principles or
techniques for the chapter. (ii) Learning Goals, a 
description of the concepts/ abilities the 
student/trainee should acquire by the end of her 
study. (iii) Schedule, an order of study and 
activities recommended for distance self- 
learners. The study guide provides a guided-tour 
through contents. It is the path recommended for 
the self-learner wishing to carry out the full 
course. 
The rest of the buttons provide direct access to 
the collection of on-line References, Links to 
external sites, Glossary, Examples, Exercises, 
Self-tests and Software. In this way the site can 
be exploited also as a complementary esource 
for teachers, trainees, students or professionals 
to enrich in a particular way their own learning 
framework. 
Estimated workload: 1 h. 
Difficulty level: Easy. 
Learning objectives: Get familiarized with IR processes and some of the WWW 
retrieval engines that will be used in subsequent exercises. 
Character: Recommended. 
Media: Link to external source. 
Solution: Questions to think about your results are provided. 
Try the following queries on at least four search engines here, and answer the questions. 
Search for 'Darbuka'. 
? How many documents have you found? 
? Is there a ranking of the documents retrieved? 
Search for 'Buy a Darbuka'. 
? Is there a big difference between the number of documents retrieved in 
both searches? Why? 
? Is there any difference in the ranking of documents retrieved? 
Try to use a boolean connective like AND (usually in "Advanced Search"): 'Buy 
AND Darbuka' 
? What has happened? 
? How many documents have been retrieved? 
? Is there any relevant document for the query? 
? Is the use of boolean connectives possible on all the search engines you 
have tried? 
? Is there another way to refine the query'? How? 
Now try searching for 'drums' and after for 'drums from the north of Africa'. 
? Which of both queries is more general? 
? Which retrieves more documents? 
? Can you change the expression "north of Africa" in order to get better 
results? 
? How does the type of words used affect he retrieval? For example, Do 
proper nouns give better esults? Why? 
? What happens if we give a description of the term instead of it? 
Compare the different search engines. 
? Which differences have you found in the results? 
? Do you detect differences in coverage'? How would you check if a known 
document is indexed or not for a given retrieval engine? 
? Which differences have you found in the way of querying? Is there any 
relation with the results? 
? Which are the main problems you have found?

References This is the main source of 
documentation to follow the course. There are 
three kinds of ~eferences: material from tutorials 
or reference books on IR and NLP, relevant 
papers on each of the topics covered, and 
reviews of the state-of-the-art and prospects for 
the future. We ,try to select only freely available 
on-line material, to eliminate the significant 
burden imposed on a distance self-learner if he 
has to obtain references in documentation 
centers. 
The Software button leads to a page where a 
variety of tools related to the course are 
described. In some cases they are available for 
interactive uge, in others they can be 
downloaded and installed in your own 
equipment. Tools are of three kinds: public 
domain, adapted for the course (for example the 
Porter algorithm) or specially licensed for the 
course. For the latter we have designed and 
build interactive web interfaces. Figure 3 shows 
an exercise inv.olving the use of external (links 
in part l, 2 and 6) and internal resources (part 
3). Clicking on "this interface", a window 
appears where one can write a text and submit it 
for "word by Word translation". The results of 
the morphological analysis and the tagger are 
shown on the left window, and the dictionary 
translation for lagged words appear on the right 
window. 
The Projects button is for registered groups of 
students, following a regular course (it means 
under the full responsibility and organization of 
a tutor). It provides an environment where you 
can perform co!!aboratively learning activities. 
4 Current status and Future 
Action 
The IRL & NLP Course site is currently public 
accessible on the WEB, still on a working status 
(actually we have invested much more than the 
funding). Now our strategy is to carry out a 
personalized call to improve and enrich 
collaboratively the site. We foresee a first phase 
targeting selected experts and performing a 
testbed with our Ph.D. university students. Then 
we will carry out a dissemination plan through 
specialized networks such as ACO*HUM and 
professional events. 
We will ask experts for their comments on the 
content and their willingness to establish 
different degrees of collaboration. From weak 
ones, such as notifying changes in their URLs, 
to more involved ones. For instance, 
contributing with practical material or tools or 
being included in the directory to answer 
potential user questions in order to create 
incrementally structured FAQs. 
With students we will test three issues: usability 
factors, content evaluation as well as 
experimental data to contrast the current 
workload estimations of the study guide. 
Our intention, for dissemination purposes, is to 
establish a cooperative framework where 
researchers on the field could update 
information or contribute with their points of 
view. In this way, this web site would constitute 
a comprehensive and updated reference for any 
course on the topic.
