Abstract 
Implemented methods for proper names 
recognition rely on large gazetteers of 
common proper nouns and a set of 
heuristic rules (e.g. Mr. as an indicator of a 
PERSON entity type). Though the 
performance of current PN recognizers is 
very high (over 90%), it is important o 
note that this problem is by no means a 
"solved problem". Existing systems 
perform extremely well on newswire 
corpora by virtue of the availability of 
large gazetteers and rule bases designed 
for specific tasks (e.g. recognition of 
Organization and Person entity types as 
specified in recent Message Understanding 
Conferences MUC). 
However, large gazetteers are not available 
for most languages and applications other 
than newswire texts and, in any case, 
proper nouns are an open class. 
In this paper we describe a context-based 
method to assign an entity type to 
unknown proper names (PNs). Like many 
others, our system relies on a gazetteer and 
a set of context-dependent heuristics to 
classify proper nouns. However, due to the 
unavailability of large gazetteers in Italian, 
over 20% detected PNs cannot be 
semantically tagged. 
The algorithm that we propose assigns an 
entity type to an unknown PN based on 
the analysis of syntactically and 
semantically similar contexts already seen 
in the application corpus. 
The performance of the algorithm is 
evaluated not only in terms of precision, 
fo l lowing the tradit ion of MUC 
conferences, but also in terms of 
Information Gain, an information theoretic 
measure that takes into account the 
complexity of the classification task. 
Introduction 
In terms of syntactic categories, proper 
nouns are lexical NPs that can be formed 
by primitive proper names (Adol -  
fo_Battaglia), groups of proper nouns of 
different semantic ategories (San Paolo 
di Brescia), and also of non-proper nouns 
(Banca dei regolamenti internazionali). In 
the latter case, capital letters are optional, 
making the problem of PN items 
identification even more complex. 
In the literature, it is accepted that an 
adeq.uate treatment of proper nouns 
reqmres the use of a context-sensitive 
grammar (McDonald, 1996). McDonald 
points out that the context sensitivity 
requirement involves two complementary 
types of evidence: internal and external. 
The internal evidence, can be derived from 
the sequence of words in a text (proper 
nouns and trigger words, such as Inc., &, 
Ltd., Company, etc.), and is gained in 
almost all state-of-art PNs recognisers by 
the use of large gazetteers and lists of 
trigger words. 
The external evidence is the context of a 
proper noun, that provides classificatory 
criteria to reinforce internal evidence, if 
any, or supplies some classificatory 
evidence. In fact, proper names form an 
open class, making the incompleteness of 
gazetteers an obvious problem. 
The methods for recognition of proper 
nouns (PNs) described in literature closely 
reflects this view of the problem. 
PN identification typically includes: 
? a gazetteer lookup, which locates simple 
and complex nominals identifying 
common PNs, such as companies, 
person names, locations, etc. 
? a set of patterns or rules, stated in terms 
of part-of-speech, syntactic or lexical 
features (e.g. Mr. as an indicator of a 
PERSON entity type), orthographic 
features (e.g. capitalization), etc. 
286 
Proper nouns recognition has recently 
attracted much attention especially in the 
area of Information Extraction, where this 
problem is known as the Named Entity 
recognition task. The highest performing 
systems include large numbers of hand- 
coded rules, or patterns, such as VIE 
(Humphreys et al 1996), the UMass 
system (Fisher et al 1997) and Proteus 
(Grishman et al 1992), but lately a high 
performance has been obtained by the use 
of statistical methods. For example, 
Ny.mble (Bikel et al 1997) learns names 
using a trained approach based on a 
variant of Hidden Markov Models. 
However, a 90% success rate is reached at 
the price of tagging manually around half 
a million words. Since PNs are mostly 
domain-specific, presumably a comparable 
effort is needed when shifting to different 
domains. 
High performances of the existing systems 
are by no means the result of many years 
of studies and research in the area of IE 
from newswire English texts, promoted 
and funded by the Message Understanding 
Conferences (MUC) organizers. Yet, there 
is no evidence that a similar performance 
could be obtained in other languages and 
domains, if not at the price of a similar 
effort for rule writing (or manual training), 
and for the compilation of a high- 
coverage gazetteer. A recent study (Palmer 
and Day, 1997) established that the 
basel ine performances of the PN 
recognition task for several anguages and 
application domains vary between 34% 
and 71%. The lower bound is calculated 
by considering a simple algorithm that 
recognizes PNs on the basis of a list of 
frequent proper nouns seen in a training 
set. 
The method we propose in this paper 
combines symbolic and statistical 
approaches to classify unknown PNs using 
context evidence previously extracted 
from the application corpus. The method 
can be used to overcome the limitation of 
small gazetteers and poorly encoded rule 
bases. 
Our method is untrained: what is needed is 
a learning (raw) corpus, a surface syntactic 
analyzer, a dictionary of synonyms, a list 
of category names for classifying PNs (we 
used the categories proposed in the 
forthcoming MUC-7), and a "start-up" 
gazetteer and rule base, used to acquire an 
initial model of typical PNs contexts. 
In the next section, we describe the method 
in detail. Section 3 is dedicated to a 
discussion of experimental results. 
2 The Method 
The problem of PN recognition has been 
considered in our group in the context of 
the European project ECRAN, aimed at 
improving domain adaptability of IE 
systems through the integrated use of 
corpora and MRDs. 
A first version of the Named Entity (NE) 
recognizer, in Italian, closely reproduced 
the architecture of the VIE recognizer, 
developed at the University of Sheffield 
(Humphreys et al 1996). 
Proper noun recognition is initially 
performed in two steps: 
1) common proper nouns are identified 
using a gazetteer, structured in files 
and related lists of trigger words for 
each proper nouns category (e.g. 
"Gulf" for LOCATIONs ,  or 
"Association" for ORGANIZATIONs); 
2) a context-sensitive grammar of about 
250 rules is used to parse proper 
nouns in contexts. The majority of 
rules uses internal evidence to identify 
and classify proper nouns made of 
complex NPs. For example the 
following rule is used to recognize 
street names: 
rule(tagged_location_np(s form: \[via, ", F2 
,' ',F3\],sem:A^B), 
\[nome(s..form:via, sem:_a_), 
organ_names_np( s_form: F2,sem:_^_), 
num(s_form:F3)\]) 
Ex: " via Giorgio Marini 34 " 
When running these first two modules on a 
one million word corpus of economic 
news (extracted from the newspaper II Sole 
24 Ore), we obtained the following 
performances: 84% precision, 85% recall, 
about 20% proper nouns correctly 
identified as such, but NOT classified. 
Unknown proper nouns are identified 
initially by the Brill part-of-speech tagger 
(Brill, 1995). Complex unknown nominals 
(e.g. Quick Take 200) are partly detected 
by simple heuristics. 
One of the motivations for such a high 
percentage of unknowns and relatively low 
performance (as compared with state-of- 
art PN recognizers) is that at the present 
state of implementation the gazetteer has a 
287 
l imited coveragel ;  yet, the problem of 
unknowns is generally recognized as 
crucial in real-world applications, because 
oroDer nouns are an open class. 
We have therefore devised a method to 
reinforce external evidence, using a 
corpus-driven algorithm to incrementally 
update the gazetteer and classification of 
unknown PNs in running texts. 
The algorithm to classify unknown proper 
nouns uses the fo l lowing l inguistic 
resources: a (raw text) learning corpus in 
the same domain as the application, a 
shallow corpus parser, a "seed" gazetteer, 
and a dictionary of synonyms. 
The shallow parser (Basili et al 1994), 
extracts f rom the learning corpus 
elementary syntactic relations such as 
subject-object, noun-preposition-noun, etc. 
A syntact ic l ink (hereafter esl) is 
represented as: 
esli(wj, mod(typei, wk)) 
where w i is the head word, Wk is the 
modifier, ~-ad typei is the type of syntactic 
relation (e.g. PP(of), PP(for), SUB J-Verb, 
Verb-DirectObject, etc.). 
The learning corpus is previous ly  
morpho log ica l ly  and syntact ica l ly  
processed. Step 1 and 2 described at the 
beginning of this section are used to detect 
PNs. A database of esls including known 
PNs  2 is then created and used by the 
algorithm to assign a category to unknown 
PNs. The algorithm works as follows: 
let PN_U be an unknown proper noun, i.e. 
a single word or a complex nominal. Let 
Cpn = (Cpnl, Cpn2 ..... CpnN) be the set of 
semantic ategories for proper nouns (e.g. 
Person,  Organizat ion,  Product etc.). 
Finally, let ESL  be the set of elementary 
syntactic links (esl) extracted from the 
1 The context sensitive grammar closely reflects, 
with extension, that developed for a similar 
application in the English VIE system. 
Therefore, low performance is likely due to the 
low-coverage gazzetteer. The absence of available 
linguistic resources in languages other than 
English is a well known problem. 
2Note that the database is not manually inspected 
for correctness (POS tagging and parsing errors). 
However, the parser assigns to each detected esl a 
statistical measure of confidence, called 
plausibility (Basili et al 1994b). 
learning corpus that include PN_U as one 
of its arguments. 
For each esli in ESL let: 
es li(w j, m od(typei, Wk)) = esli(x, PN U) 
where x=wj or Wk and PN_U =Wk or wj, 
typei is the syntactic type of esl (e.g. N-di- 
N, N_N, V-per-N ecc), and further let: 
pl(esli (x, PN_U) 
be the plausibility of a detected esl. The 
plausibility is a measure of the statistical 
evidence of a detected syntactic link (Basili 
et al 1994b), that depends upon local (i.e. 
at the sentence level) syntactic ambiguity 
and global corpus evidence. 
Finally, let: 
- ESLA be a set of esls defined as follows: 
for each esli(x,PN_U) in ESL  put in 
ESLA the set of es l j (x ,PNj) ,  in the 
corpus, with type=typei, x in the same 
position of esli, and PNi a known proper 
noun, in the same position as PN_U in 
esli, 
ESLB be the set of eslk defined as 
follows: for each esli(x,PN_U) in ESL  
put in ESLB the set of eslj(w,PNj), in the 
corpus, with type=typei, w in the same 
position of x in esli, Sim(w,x)> 8, and 
PNj a known proper noun, in the same 
position as PNU in esl i. Sim(w,x) is a 
similarity measure between x and w. In 
our first experiments, Sim(w,x)> 8 iff w 
is a synonym of x. 
For each semantic ategory Con i compute 
evidence(Cpnj) as shown ih-Figure 1, 
where: 
amb(esl(x, PNi)) is a measure of the 
ambiguity of x and PNj in esli; 
- tx and 13 are experimentally determined 
weights (currently, t~=0.7 and 13=0.3). 
The selected category for PN_U is: 
C=argmax( evidence( Cpnk) )=maxj( evidence( Cpnj) 
The underlying hypothesis is that, in a 
given application corpus, a PN has a 
unique sense. This is a reasonable 
restr ict ion supported by empir ica l  
evidence (see also (Gale et al 1992)). An 
alternative solution would be to select the 
"best performing" tags, and then apply

3 Discuss ion of  the Exper iment  
In our experiment, we used a corpus of 
one million words extracted from articles 
in the II Sole 24 Ore economic newspaper. 
A database of 76055 esls including proper 
nouns was obtained. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of esls by 
category, and the prior probability (i.e. 
relative distribution) of each category.

Table 1 - PN distribution by category 
The semantic ategories in Table 1, with 
the addition of Product, are those that will 
be used for Named Entity task evaluation 
in the forthcoming MUC-7 contest. 
In Figure 2, a complete experiment is 
reported. In the figure, an esl is 
represented as a list, for example (0.5 
G_N_P_N Quick_Take_200 0 1 in 
documento) .  The detected esl is 
'Quick_Take_200 in documento ' 
(Quick_Take_200 in document), the 
syntactic type is G N P N (noun- 
preposition-noun), the plausibility is 0.5, 
the initial category of Quick_Take_200 is
0 (= unknown) and its ambiguity is 
initially set to 1. 
It is seen in the figure that some detected 
esls do not contribute to the computation 
of (1) (e.g. acqu is i re  con 
Quick Take_200 to acquire with 
Quick_Take_200) while some other esl 
turns out to be particularly informative 
(e.g. qualita' di Quick_Take_200 quality 
of Quick_Take_200) 
For the name Quick_Take_200 (a software 
product), the category 8 is finally selected 
(PRODUCT, as shown in the figure). 
An extended experiment was designed as 
follows: 
We selected from the corpus 35 PNs for 
each of the . following categories: 
Organization, Person, Location and 
Product 3. The PNs are selected by ranges 
of frequency in the corpus, except for 
Producs, that are very rare in our excerpt 
of the II Sole 24 Ore: here we selected the 
35 top frequency PNs. 
We then removed each of the 140 PNs 
from the gazetteer, one at the time, and 
attempted a re-classification using our 
algorithm. 
To evaluate the performances we used, in 
addition to the classical Precision measure, 
the Information Gain (Kononenko and 
Bratko, 1991). 
The Information Gain is an information- 
theoretic measure that takes into account 
the complexity of the classification task. 
3The other categories are less interesting in our 
view. Numbers, dates etc. are recursive and 
regular phenomena that can be detected ina more 
general way by the use of specific grammars or 
pattern matchers.

If P(C) is the prior (a-priori) probability 4 
that an instance c is a member of class C, 
and P'(C) is the probability of c e C, as 
computed by the classifier in a given test ti, 
the Information Gain I(ti) is defined as: 
I(ti) = log(1-P(C)) - log(1-P'(C)) 
if P(C) > P'(C) 
or  
I(ti) = log(P'(C)) - log(P(C)) 
if P'(C) > P(C) 
That is, if the classification is wrong, I(ti) is 
a penalty as high as the classification task 
4The prior probability can be easily computed in 
a learning set as the ratio between the number of 
training instances belonging to a class C and the 
total number of training instances. In our 
experiment, the prior probabilities are listed in 
Table 1. 
was an easy one (i.e. the prior probability 
of C was high). If the classification is 
correct, I(ti) is a price as high as the 
classification task was complex (i.e. the 
prior probability of C was low). 
Over a test set of T cases, I is given by: 
I T 
I= - -z~, I ( t i )  
T i=1 
Table 2 illustrates the results. It is seen that 
unknown PNs in the three major categories 
(those for which there is evidence in the 
corpus and in the gazetteer) have a very 
high probabil ity of  being correctly 
classified (up to 100% for Organizations). 
On the contrary, we obtain poor 
performances with Products. 
However, Product is interesting because: 
- there are no more than 50-60 product 
names in the gazetteer (which we 
290 
manually added for the purpose of this 
experiment) 
there are no contextual rules for 
Products in the context-sensit ive 
grammar. 
Thus, both prior probability and prior 
knowledge on Products are close to zero. 
This is numerically evidenced by the 
Information Gain: though we are not 
learning much about Products, the 
Information Gain is higher than for the 
other categories, and also as an absolute 
value (in (Kononenko and Bratko, 1991) a 
0,5 bit improvement is among the highest 
measured values in a comparative 
experiment). In addition, the relative 
precision of classifying PNs as Product is 
100%. This means that most products are 
misclassified, but, if something is classified 
as Product, this information can be reliably 
used to enrich the gazetteer.

Here, the prior probability of Products is 
obviously higher, though -due to the poor 
gazetteer- there is an elevated number of 
unrecognized products. 
In this corpus we selected and then 
removed 35 product names, and now the 
system correctly classifies 31. Notice that 
in this experiment the gazetteer and the PN 
grammar are the same as before, The only 
difference is that the corpus provides more 
evidence (contexts) concerning those 
products that have been recognized as 
such. Notice on the other side, that the 
Information Gain now is very low. 
4 Conc lus ions  and Future  Work  
Our current implementation of a PN 
analyzer still has a limited performance, 
caused by a variety of problems that range 
from unsatisfactory performance of state- 
of-art POS taggers in inflected languages, 
to l imited availability of l inguistic 
resources,in Italian, such as PN gazetteers. 
The algorithm that we propose has indeed 
the purpose of overcoming limitations of 
gazetteers and manual ly  def ined 
contextual rules for PN recognition. In 
(Cucchiarelli et al 1998) we also show 
how to extend our method to 
incrementally update the initial gazzeteer. 
The performance of the proposed 
algorithm is more than satisfactory. A 
comparison with existing systems is 
difficult because in the literature global PN 
recognition performances are reported, 
without consider ing the semantic 
classification of unknowns as a subtask. 
The only exception is in (Wacholder et al 
1997) where the reported performance for 
the sole semantic disambiguation task of 
PNs is 79%. In that paper, however, 
semantic disambiguation is performed 
among a lower number of classes 5. 
The performance of our system is clearly 
affected by the dimension of the initial 
seed gazetteer and contextual rules. If the 
sets ESLA and ESLB are large enough, 
obviously more examples of similar 
contexts are found, even for unknown PNs 
with a single occurrence. 
In our test experiment, we always managed 
to find at least one or two similar contexts 
of an unknown PN, but in some cases they 
were misleading and caused a wrong 
classification, especially for Products. 
However, it may be possible to increase the 
evidence provided by the set ESLB by 
including contexts in which the words are 
5One of the advantages of Information Gain is 
that, if widely adopted, this measure facilitates 
the comparison among learning methods with 
different complexity of the classification task. 
291 
not strictly synonyms, but belong to the 
same semantic ategory. 
One such experiment requires a word 
taxonomy, like for example WordNet. 
WordNet is currently unavailable in Italian 
(the first known results of the 
EuroWordNet project are too preliminary), 
therefore we plan to reproduce our 
experiment in English. 
Another strategy to improve performances 
in absence of a substantial evidence is the 
definition of general (not contextual) rules 
to capture unknown complex nominals. 
For example ,  looking at the Product 
experiment in more detail, we found that 
product names are often formed by very 
complex nominals, e.g. Fiat- Marea 
Weekend 2000 (the name of a car model). 
Capturing complex nominals in absence of 
anchors and specific contextual rules (here 
the only anchor is Fiat, which appears in 
the gazetteer as an Organization ame) 
may be difficult, and if a complex nominal 
is not captured as a unit, the resulting 
syntactic ontext may be misleading (e.g. 
N_ADJ(Fiat_Marea_Weekend, 2000)). 
We believe that finding class-independent 
heuristics for capturing complex nominals 
is a more "general" way of improving the 
performance of the method, rather than 
adding specific rules for specific entity 
types and enriching the gazetteer.
