Abstract
This paper summarizes the Protein Coref-
erence Resolution task of BioNLP Shared
Task 2011. After 7 weeks of system devel-
opment period, the task received final sub-
missions from 6 teams. Evaluation results
show that state-of-the-art performance on the
task can find 22.18% of protein coreferences
with the precision of 73.26%. Analysis of
the submissions shows that several types of
anaphoric expressions including definite ex-
pressions, which occupies a significant part of
the problem, have not yet been solved.
1 Introduction
While named entity recognition (NER) and relation
or event extraction are regarded as standard tasks
of information extraction (IE), coreference resolu-
tion (Ng, 2010; Bejan and Harabagiu, 2010) is more
and more recognized as an important component of
IE for a higher performance. Without coreference
resolution, the performance of IE is often substan-
tially limited due to an abundance of coreference
structures in natural language text, i.e. information
pieces written in text with involvement of a corefer-
ence structure are hard to be captured (Miwa et al,
2010). There have been several attempts for coref-
erence resolution, particularly for newswire texts
(Strassel et al, 2008; Chinchor, 1998). It is also one
of the lessons from BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-
ST, hereafter) 2009 that coreference structures in
biomedical text substantially hinder the progress of
fine-grained IE (Kim et al, 2009).
To address the problem of coreference resolution
in molecular biology literature, the Protein Corefer-
ence (COREF) task is arranged in BioNLP-ST 2011
as a supporting task. While the task itself is not
an IE task, it is expected to be a useful compo-
nent in performing the main IE tasks more effec-
tively. To establish a stable evaluation and to observe
the effect of the results of the task to the main IE
tasks, the COREF task particularly focuses on find-
ing anaphoric protein references.
The benchmark data sets for developing and test-
ing coreference resolution system were developed
based on various manual annotations made to the
Genia corpus (Ohta et al, 2002). After 7 weeks of
system development phase, for which training and
development data sets with coreference annotation
were given, six teams submitted their prediction of
coreferences for the test data. The best system ac-
cording to our primary evaluation criteria is evalu-
ated to find 22.18% of anaphoric protein references
at the precision of 73.26%.
This paper presents overall explanation of the
COREF task, which includes task definition (Sec-
tion 2), data preparation (Section 4), evaluation
methods (Section 5), results (Section 7), and thor-
ough analyses (Section 8) to figure out what are
remaining problems for coreference resolution in
biomedical text.
2 Problem Definition
This section provides an explanation of the corefer-
ence resolution task in our focus, through examples.
Figure 1 shows an example text segmented into
four sentences, S2 - S5, where anaphoric corefer-
ences are illustrated with colored extends and ar-
rows. In the figure, protein names are highlighted in
purple, T4 - T10, and anaphoric protein references,
e.g. pronouns and definite noun phrases, are high-
lighted in red, T27, T29, T30, T32, of which the an-
74
Figure 1: Protein coreference annotation
tecedents are indicated by arrows if found in the text.
In the example, the definite noun phrase (NP), this
transcription factor (T32), is a coreference to p65
(T10). Without knowing the coreference structure,
it becomes hard to capture the information written
in the phrase, nuclear exclusion of this transcription
factor, which is localization of p65 (out of nucleus)
according to the framework of BioNLP-ST.
A standard approach would include a step to find
candidate anaphoric expressions that may refer to
proteins. In this task, pronouns, e.g. it or they, and
definite NPs that may refer to proteins, e.g. the tran-
scription factor or the inhibitor are regarded as can-
didates of anaphoric protein references. This step
corresponds to markable detection and anaphoric-
ity determination steps in the jargon of MUC. The
next step would be to find the antecedents of the
anaphoric expressions. This step corresponds to
anaphora resolution in the jargon of MUC.
3 Task Setting
In the task, the training, development and test data
sets are provided in three types of files: the text, the
protein annotation, and the coreference annotation
files. The text files contain plain texts which are tar-
get of annotation. The protein annotation files pro-
vide gold annotation for protein names in the texts,
and the coreference annotation files provide gold an-
notation for anaphoric references to those protein
names. The protein annotation files are given to the
participants, together with all the training, develop-
ment and test data sets. The coreference annotation
files are not given with the test data set, and the task
for the participants is to produce them automatically.
In protein annotation files, annotations for protein
names are given in a stand-off style encoding. For
example, those highlighted in purple in Figure 1 are
protein names, which are given in protein annotation
files as follows:
T4 Protein 275 278 p65
T5 Protein 294 297 p50
T6 Protein 367 372 v-rel
T7 Protein 406 409 p65
T8 Protein 597 600 p50
T9 Protein 843 848 MAD-3
T10 Protein 879 882 p65
The first line indicates there is a protein reference
in the span that begins at 275th character and ends
before 278th character, of which the text is ?p65?,
and the annotation is identified by the id, ?T4?
The coreference annotation files include three sort
of annotations. First, annotations for anaphoric pro-
tein references are given. For example, those in red
in Figure 1 are anaphoric protein references:
T27 Exp 179 222 the N.. 215 222 complex
T29 Exp 307 312 which
T30 Exp 459 471 this .. 464 471 complex
T32 Exp 1022 1047 this .. 1027 1047 tra..
The first line indicates that there is an anaphoric
protein reference in the specified span, of which the
text is ?the NF-kappa B transcription factor com-
plex? (truncated due to limit of space), and that its
minimal expression is ?complex?. Second, noun
phrases that are antecedents of the anaphoric refer-
ences are also given in the coreference annotation
file. For example, T28 and T31 (highlighted in blue)
are antecedents of T29 and T32, respectively, and
thus given in the file:
T28 Exp 264 297 NF-ka..
T31 Exp 868 882 NF-ka..
Third, the coreference relation between the
anaphoric expressions and their antecedents are
given in predicate-argument expressions1:
R1 Coref Ana:T29 Ant:T28 [T5, T4]
R2 Coref Ana:T30 Ant:T27
R3 Coref Ana:T32 Ant:T31 [T10]
The first line indicates there is a coreference rela-
tion, R1, of which the anaphor is T29 and the an-
tecedent is T28, and the relation involves two protein
names, T5 and T4.
Note that, sometimes, an anaphoric expression,
e.g. which (T29), is connected to more than one
protein names, e.g. p65 (T4) and p50 (T5). Some-
times, coreference structures do not involve any spe-
cific protein names, e.g. T30 and T27. In order
1Due to limitation of space, argument names are abbrevi-
ated, e.g. ?Ana? for ?Anaphora?, and ?Ant? for ?Antecedent?
75
to establish a stable evaluation, our primary evalu-
ation will focus only on coreference structures that
involve specific protein names, e.g. T29 and T28,
and T32 and T31. Among the three, only two, R1
and R3, involves specific protein references, T4 and
T5, and T10. Thus, finding of R2 will be ignored
in the primary evaluation. However, those not in-
volving specific protein references are also provided
in the training data to help system development,
and will be considered in the secondary evaluation
mode. See section 5 for more detail.
4 Data Preparation
The data sets for the COREF task are produced
based on three resources: MedCO coreference an-
notation (Su et al, 2008), Genia event annotation
(Kim et al, 2008), and Genia Treebank (Tateisi et
al., 2005). Although the three have been developed
independently from each other, they are annotations
made to the same corpus, the Genia corpus (Kim et
al., 2008). Since COREF was focused on finding
anaphoric references to proteins (or genes), only rel-
evant annotations were extracted from the MedCO
corpus though the following process:
1. From MedCo annotation, coreference entities that
were pronouns and definite base NPs were ex-
tracted, which became candidate anaphoric expres-
sions. The base NPs were determined by consulting
Genia Tree Bank.
2. Among the candidate anaphoric expressions, those
that could not be protein references were filtered
out. This process was done by checking the head
noun of NPs. For example, definite NPs with ?cell?
as their head noun were filtered out. The remaining
ones became candidate protein coreferences.
3. The candidate protein coreferences and their an-
tecedents according to MedCo annotation were in-
cluded in the data files for COREF task.
4. The protein name annotations from Genia event
annotation were added to the data files to deter-
mine which coreference expressions involve protein
name references.
Table 1 summarizes the coreference entities in the
training, development, and test sets for COREF task.
In the table, the anaphoric entities are classified into
four types as follows:
RELAT indicates relative pronouns or relative adjec-
tives, e.g. that, which, or whose.
PRON indicates pronouns, e.g. it.

DNP indicates definite NPs or demonstrative NPs, e.g.
NPs that begin with the, this, etc.
APPOS indicates coreferences in apposition.
5 Evaluation
The coreference resolution performance is evaluated
in two modes.
The Surface coreference mode evaluates the per-
formance of finding anaphoric protein references
and their antecedents, regardless whether the an-
tecedents actually embed protein names or not. In
other words, it evaluates the ability to predict the
coreference relations as provided in the gold coref-
erence annotation file, which we call surface coref-
erence links.
The protein coreference mode evaluates the per-
formance of finding anaphoric protein references
with their links to actual protein names (protein
coreference links). In the implementation of the
evaluation, the chain of surface coreference linkes
is traced until an antecedent embedding a protein
name is found. If a protein-name-embedding an-
tecedent is connected to an anaphora through only
one surfs link, we call the antecedent a direct pro-
tein antecedent. If a protein-name-embedding an-
teceden is connected to an anaphora through more
than one surface link, we call it an indirect protein
antecedent, and the antecedents in the middle of the
chain intermediate antecedents. The performance
evaluated in this mode may be directly connected
to the potential performance in main IE tasks: the
more the (anaphoric) protein references are found,
the more the protein-related events may be found.
For this reason, the protein coreference mode is cho-
sen as the primary evaluation mode.
Evaluation results for both evaluation modes are
76
given in traditional precision, recall and f-score,
which are similar to (Baldwin, 1997).
5.1 Surface coreference
A response expression is matched with a gold ex-
pression following partial match criterion. In par-
ticular, a response expression is considered cor-
rect when it covers the minimal boundary, and is
included in the maximal boundary of expression.
Maximal boundary is the span of expression anno-
tation, and minimal boundary is the head of ex-
pression, as defined in MUC annotation schemes
(Chinchor, 1998). A response link is correct when
its two argument expressions are correctly matched
with those of a gold link.
5.2 Protein coreference
This is the primary evaluation perspective of the pro-
tein coreference task. In this mode, we ignore coref-
erence links that do not reference to proteins. Inter-
mediate antecedents are also ignored.
Protein coreference links are generated from the
surface coreference links. A protein coreference link
is composed of an anaphoric expression and a pro-
tein reference that appears in its direct or indirect
antecedent. Below is an example.
Example:
R1 Coref Ana:T29 Ant:T28 [T5, T4]
R2 Coref Ana:T30 Ant:T27
R3 Coref Ana:T32 Ant:T31 [T10]
R4 Coref Ana:T33 Ant:T32
In this example, supposing that there are four surface
links in the coreference annotation file (T29,T28),
(T30,T27), (T32,T31), and (T33, T32), in which
T28 contains two protein mentions T5, T4, and T31
contains one protein mention T10; thus, the protein
coreference links generated from these surface links
are (T29,T4), (T29,T5), (T32,T10), and (T33, T10).
Notice that T33 is connected with T10 through the
intermediate expression T32.
Response expressions and generated response re-
sult links are matched with gold expressions and
links correspondingly in a way similar to the surface
coreference evaluation mode.

The tool column shows the external tools used
in resolution processing. Among these tools,
there is only one team used an external coref-
erence resolution framework, Reconcile, which
achieved the state-of-the-art performance for super-
vised learning-based coreference resolution (Stoy-
anov et al, 2010b).
7 Results
7.1 Protein coreference results
Evaluation results in the protein coreference mode
are shown in Table 3. The UU team got the high-
est f-score 34.05%. The UZ and CU teams are
the second- and third-best teams with 30.96% and
29.65% f-score correspondingly, which are compa-
rable to each other. Unfortunately, two teams, US
and UC could not produce meaningful results, and
the other four teams show performance optimized
for high precision. It was expected that the 22.18%
of protein coreferences may contribute to improve
the performance on main task, which was not ob-
served this time, unfortunately.

domain. It supports the hypothesis that machine
learning-based coreference resolution tool trained
on different domains can be helpful for the bio med-
ical domain; however, it still requires some adapta-
tions.
7.2 Surface coreference results
Table 4 shows the evaluation results in the surface
link mode. The overall performances of all the sys-
tems are low, in which recalls are much higher than
the precisions. One possible reason of the low re-
sults is because most of the teams focus on resolv-
ing pronominal coreference; however, they failed to
solve some difficult types of pronoun such as ?it?,
?its?, ?these?, ?them?, and ?which?, which occupy
the majority of anaphoric pronominal expressions
(Table 1). Definite anaphoric expressions were ig-
nored by almost all of the systems (except one sub-
mission).
The results show that the protein coreference res-
olution is not a trivial task; and many parts remains
challenging. In next section, we analyze about po-
tential reason of the low results, and discuss possible
directions for further improvement.

8 Analysis
8.1 Why the rankings based on the two
evaluation methods are not the same?
Comparing with the protein coreference mode, we
can see the rankings based on two evaluation meth-
ods are different. In order to find out what led to
this interesting difference, we further analyzed the
submissions from the two teams UT and UU. The
UT team achieved the highest f-score in the surface
evaluation mode, but was in the fourth rank in the
protein evaluation mode. Meanwhile, the score of
UU team was slightly less than the UT team in the
former mode, but got the highest in the later (Table
3 and Table 4). In other words, there is no clear cor-
relation between the two evaluation results.
Because the two precisions in surface evaluation
mode are not much different, the recalls were the
main contribution in the difference of f-score. An-
alyzing the correct and missing examples in both
evaluation modes, we found that there are anaphors
whose surface links are correct, while the protein
links with the same anaphors are evaluated as miss-
ing; and vice versa with missing surface links and
correct protein links. Counts of anaphors of each
78
type are shown in Table 5. In this table, the cell
at column UT and row S-correct and P-missing can
be interpreted as following. There are 29 anaphors
in the UT response whose surface links are correct
but protein links are missing, which contributes pos-
itively to the recall in surface coreference mode, and
negatively to that in protein coreference mode.
Table 6 shows two examples of S-correct and
P-missing. In the first example, we can see that
the gold antecedent proteins are contained in an in-
direct antecedent. Therefore, when the interme-
diate antecedent is correctly detected by the sur-
face link R1, but the indirect antecedent is not de-
tected, the anaphor is not linked to it antecedent
proteins ?DQalpha? and ?DQbeta?. Another reason
is because response antecedents do not include an-
tecedent proteins. This is actually the problem of
expression boundary detection. An example of this
is example 2 (Table 6), in which the response sur-
face link R2 is correct, but the protein links to the
four proteins are not detected, because the response
antecedent ?five members? does not include the pro-
tein mentions ?SCL, TAL-2, LYL-1 and E2A?. How-
ever, the response antecedent expression is correct
because it contains the minimal boundary ?mem-
bers?.
For S-missing and P-correct, we found that
anaphors are normally directly linked to antecedent
proteins. In other words, expression boundary is
same as protein boundary. Another case is that re-
sponse antecedents contain the antecedent proteins,
but are evaluated as incorrect because the expres-
sion boundary of the response expression is larger
than the gold expression. An example is shown in
Table 7 where the response expression ?a second
GCR, termed GCRbeta? includes the gold expres-
sion ?GCRbeta?. Therefore, although the surface
link is incorrect because the response expression is
evaluated as incorrect, the protein coreference link
receives a full score .
The difference reflects the characteristics of the
two evaluation methods. The analysis result also
shows the affect of markable detection or expression
detection on the resolution evaluation result.
8.2 Protein coreference analysis
We want to see how well each system performs on
each type of anaphor. However, the type information

T19 which

Table 7: Examples of S-missing and P-correct
is not explicitly included in the response, so it has
to be induced automatically. We done this by find-
ing the first word of anaphoric expression; then, we
combine it with 1 if the expression is a single-word
expression, or 2 if the expression is multi-word, to
create a sub type value for each anaphor of both
gold and response anaphors. After that, subtypes are
mapped with the anaphor types specified in Section
4 using the mapping in Table 10.
Protein coreference resolution results by sub type
are given in Table 9 and 8. It can be easily seen in
Table 9 which team performed well on which type
of anaphor. In particular, the CU system was good at
resolving the RELAT, APPOS and other types. The
UU team performed well on the DNP type. And for
the PRON type, UZ was the best team. In theory,
knowing this, we can combine strengths of the teams
to tackle all the types.
We analyzed false positive protein anaphora links
to see what types of anaphora are solved by each
system. The recalls in Table 11 are calculated based
on the anaphor type information manually annotated
in the gold data. Comparing with those in Table 9,
there is a small difference due to the automatic in-
duction of anaphoric types based on sub types. It
can be seen in the table 11 that only 77.5 percent of
RELAT-typed anaphora links were resolved (by CU
team), although this type is supposed to be the eas-
iest type. Examining the output data, we found that
the system tends to choose the nearest expression
as the antecedent of a relative pronoun; however,
this is not always correct, as in the following exam-
ples from the UofU submission: ?We also identified
functional Aiolos-binding sites1a in the Bcl-2 pro-
moter1b, which1 are able to activate the luciferase
reporter gene.?, and ?Furthermore, the analysis of
IkappaBalpha turnover demonstrated an increased

cates correct antecedent, and b subscript indicates
the wrong one. In these examples, the relative pro-
noun that and which are incorrectly linked with the
nearest expression, which is actually part of post-
modifier or the correct antecedent expression.
For the DNP type, recall of the best system is less
than 6 percent (Table 11), although it is an impor-
tant type which occupies almost one fifth of all pro-
tein links (Table 1). There is only one team, the UC
team, attempted to tackle the anaphor; however, it
resulted in many spurious links. The other teams
did not make any prediction on this type. A possi-
ble reason of this is because there are much more
non-anaphoric definite noun phrases than anaphoric
ones, which making it difficult to train an effective
classier for anaphoricity determination. We have to
seek for a better method for solving the DNP links,
in order to significantly improve protein coreference
resolution system.
Concerning the PRON type, Table 8 shows that
except for that-1, no other figures are higher than
50 percent f-score. This is an interesting obser-
vation because pronominal anaphora problem has
been reported with much higher results on other
domains(Raghunathan et al, 2010), and also on
other bio data (hsiang Lin and Liang, 2004). One
of the reasons for the low recall is because target
anaphoric pronouns in the bio domain are neutral-
gender and third-person pronouns(Nguyen and Kim,
2008), which are difficult to resolve than other types
of pronouns(Stoyanov et al, 2010a).
8.3 Protein coreference analysis - Intermediate
antecedent
As mentioned in the task setting, anaphors can di-
rectly link to their antecedent, or indirectly link via
one or more intermediate antecedents. We counted
the numbers of correct direct and indirect protein
coreference links in each submission (Table 12).

Table 12: Numbers of correct protein coreference links
by anaphor type and by number of antecedents, based on
manual type annotation. A=APPOS, R=RELAT, D=DNP,
P=PRON, O=Others. Di=direct, In=indirect.
APPOS and Others types do not have any intermedi-
ate antecedent, thus there is only one column marked
with D (direct protein coreference link). We can
see in this table that very few indirect links were
detected. Therefore, there is place to improve our
resolution system by focusing on detection of such
links.
8.4 Surface coreference results
Because inclusion of all expressions was not a re-
quirement of shared task submission, the submitted
results may not contain expressions that do not in-
volve in any coreference links. Therefore, it is un-
fair to evaluate expression detection based on the re-
sponse expressions.
Evaluation results for anaphoricity determination
are shown in Table 13. The calculation is performed
as following. Supposing that every anaphor has a
response link, the number of anaphors is number
of distinct anaphoric expressions inferred from the
response links, which is given in the first column.
The total number of gold anaphors are also calcu-
lated in similar way. Since response expressions
are lined with gold expressions before evaluation,

Table 13: Anaphoricity determination results. Total num-
ber of gold anaphors = 210. Resp = number of response
anchors, Align = alignment rate(%), P = precision (%), R
= recall (%), F = f-score (%)
we provided the alignment rate for reference in the
second column of the table. The third and forth
columns show the precisions and recalls. In theory,
low anaphoricity determination precision results in
many spurious response links, while low recall be-
comes the bottle neck for the overall coreference
resolution recall. Therefore, we can conclude that
the low performance of anaphoricity determination
contribute to the low coreference evaluation results
(Table 4, Table 3).
9 Conclusion
The coreference resolution supporting task of
BioNLP Shared Task 2011 has drawn attention from
researchers of different interests. Although the over-
all results are not good enough to be helpful for the
main shared tasks as expected, the analysis results in
this paper shows the coreference types which have
and have not yet been successfully solved. Tack-
ling the remained problems in expression bound-
ary detection, anaphoricity determination and reso-
lution algorithms for difficult types of anaphors such
as definite noun phrases should be the future work.
Then, it would be interesting to see how much coref-
erence can contribute to event extraction.
