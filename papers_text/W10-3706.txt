Abstract 
This paper presents the automatic ex-
traction of Complex Predicates (CPs) 
in Bengali with a special focus on 
compound verbs (Verb + Verb) and 
conjunct verbs (Noun /Adjective + 
Verb). The lexical patterns of com-
pound and conjunct verbs are extracted 
based on the information of shallow 
morphology and available seed lists of 
verbs. Lexical scopes of compound and 
conjunct verbs in consecutive sequence 
of Complex Predicates (CPs) have 
been identified. The fine-grained error 
analysis through confusion matrix 
highlights some insufficiencies of lexi-
cal patterns and the impacts of different 
constraints that are used to identify the 
Complex Predicates (CPs). System 
achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 
77.92% for compound verbs and 
89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs 
respectively on two types of Bengali 
corpus.      
1 Introduction 
Complex Predicates (CPs) contain [verb] + 
verb (compound verbs) or [noun/ 
adjective/adverb] +verb (conjunct verbs) 
combinations in South Asian languages (Hook, 
1974). To the best of our knowledge, Bengali  
 
 
is not only a language of South Asia but also 
the sixth popular language in the World 1 , 
second in India and the national language of 
Bangladesh. The identification of Complex 
Predicates (CPs) adds values for building 
lexical resources (e.g. WordNet (Miller et al, 
1990; VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)), 
parsing strategies and machine translation 
systems.  
Bengali is less computerized compared to 
English due to its morphological enrichment. 
As the identification of Complex Predicates 
(CPs) requires the knowledge of morphology, 
the task of automatically extracting the Com-
plex Predicates (CPs) is a challenge. Complex 
Predicates (CPs) in Bengali consists of two 
types, compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct 
verbs (ConjVs). 
The compound verbs (CompVs) (e.g. ? ?? 
? ?? mere phela ?kill?, ???? ???? bolte laglo 
?started saying?) consist of two verbs. The first 
verb is termed as Full Verb (FV) that is present 
at surface level either as conjunctive participial 
form -e ?e or the infinitive form -?  ?te. The 
second verb bears the inflection based on 
Tense, Aspect and Person. The second verbs 
that are termed as Light Verbs (LV) are 
polysemous, semantically bleached and 
confined into some definite candidate seeds 
(Paul, 2010).  
On the other hand, each of the Bengali con-
junct verbs (ConjVs) (e.g. ???? ??? bharsha

n.asp?by=size

kara ?to depend?, ???? ??? jhakjhak kara ?to 
glow?) consists of noun or adjective followed 
by a Light Verb (LV). The Light Verbs (LVs) 
bear the appropriate inflections based on 
Tense, Aspect and Person.   
According to the definition of multi-word 
expressions (MWEs)(Baldwin and Kim, 2010), 
the absence of conventional meaning of the 
Light Verbs in Complex Predicates (CPs) 
entails us to consider the Complex Predicates 
(CPs) as MWEs (Sinha, 2009). But, there are 
some typical examples of Complex Predicates 
(CPs), e.g. ? ?? ??? dekha kara ?see-do? that 
bear the similar lexical pattern as Full Verb 
(FV)+ Light Verb (LV) but both of the Full 
Verb (FV) and Light Verb (LV) loose their 
conventional meanings and generate a 
completely different meaning (?to meet? in this 
case).  
In addition to that, other types of predicates 
such as ???? ? ? niye gelo ?take-go? (took and 
went), ???? ? ? diye gelo ?give-go? (gave and 
went) follows the similar lexical patterns 
FV+LV as of Complex Predicates (CPs) but 
they are not mono-clausal. Both the Full Verb 
(FV) and Light Verb (LV) behave like 
independent syntactic entities and they belong 
to non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs). The 
verbs are also termed as Serial Verb (SV) 
(Mukherjee et al, 2006). 
Butt (1993) and Paul (2004) have also 
mentioned the following criteria that are used 
to check the validity of complex predicates 
(CPs) in Bengali. The following cases are the 
invalid criteria of complex predicates (CPs). 
1. Control Construction (CC): ????? ??? 
likhte bollo ?asked to write?, ????? ???? 
??? likhte badhyo korlo ?forced to 
write? 
2. Modal Control Construction (MCC): 
? ?? ??? jete hobe ?have to go? ? ?? ??? 
khete hobe ?have to eat? 
3. Passives (Pass) : ??? ??? dhora porlo 
?was caught?, ???? ?? mara holo ?was 
beaten? 
4. Auxiliary Construction (AC): ??? ??? 
bose ache ?is sitting?, ???? ??? niye chilo 
?had taken?. 
Sometimes, the successive sequence of the 
Complex Predicates (CPs) shows a problem of 
deciding the scopes of individual Complex 
Predicates (CPs) present in that sequence. For 
example the sequence, u?? ??? ? ???? uthe pore 
dekhlam ?rise-wear-see? (rose and saw) seems 
to contain two Complex Predicates (CPs) (u?? 
??? uthe pore ?rose? and ??? ? ???? pore 
dekhlam ?wore and see?). But there is actually 
one Complex Predicate (CP). The first one u?? 
??? uthe pore ?rose? is a compound verb 
(CompV) as well as a Complex Predicate (CP). 
Another one is ? ???? dekhlam ?saw? that is a 
simple verb. As the sequence is not mono-
clausal, the Complex Predicate (CP) u?? ??? 
uthe pore ?rose? associated with ? ???? dekhlam 
?saw? is to be separated by a lexical boundary. 
Thus the determination of lexical scopes of 
Complex Predicates (CPs) from a long con-
secutive sequence is indeed a crucial task.      
 The present task therefore not only aims to 
extract the Complex Predicates (CPs) 
containing compound and conjunct verbs but 
also to resolve the problem of deciding the 
lexical scopes automatically. The compound 
verbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) 
are extracted from two separate Bengali 
corpora based on the morphological 
information (e.g. participle forms, infinitive 
forms and inflections) and list of Light Verbs 
(LVs). As the Light Verbs (LVs) in the 
compound verbs (CompVs) are limited in 
number, fifteen predefined verbs (Paul, 2010) 
are chosen as Light Verbs (LVs) for framing 
the compound verbs (CompVs).  A manually 
prepared seed list that is used to frame the 
lexical patterns for conjunct verbs (ConjVs) 
contains frequently used Light Verbs (LVs).  
An automatic method is designed to identify 
the lexical scopes of compound and conjunct 
verbs in the long sequences of Complex 
Predicates (CPs). The identification of lexical 
scope of the Complex Predicates (CPs) 
improves the performance of the system as the 
number of identified Complex Predicates 
(CPs) increases.  
Manual evaluation is carried out on two 
types of Bengali corpus. The experiments are 
carried out on 800 development sentences 
from two corpora but the final evaluation is 
carried out on 1000 sentences. Overall, the 
system achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 
77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and 
89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively.

The error analysis shows that not only the 
lexical patterns but also the augmentation of 
argument structure agreement (Das, 2009), the 
analysis of Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or 
Serial Verb, Control Construction (CC), 
Modal Control Construction (MCC), Passives 
(Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) (Butt, 
1993; Paul, 2004) are also necessary to 
identify the Complex Predicates (CPs). The 
error analysis shows that the system suffers in 
distinguishing the Complex Predicates (CPs) 
from the above constraint constructions.  
The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the related work 
done in this area. The automatic extraction of 
compound and conjunct verbs is described in 
Section 3. In Section 4, the identification of 
lexical scopes of the Complex Predicates 
(CPs) is mentioned. Section 5 discusses the 
results of evaluation along with error analysis. 
Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 
2 Related Work 
The general theory of complex predicate is 
discussed in Alsina (1996). Several attempts 
have been organized to identify complex 
predicates in South Asian languages (Abbi, 
1991; Bashir, 1993; Verma, 1993) with a spe-
cial focus to Hindi (Burton-Page, 1957; Hook, 
1974), Urdu (Butt, 1995), Bengali (Sarkar, 
1975; Paul, 2004), Kashmiri (Kaul, 1985) and 
Oriya (Mohanty, 1992). But the automatic ex-
traction of Complex Predicates (CPs) has been 
carried out for few languages, especially 
Hindi. 
The task described in (Mukherjee et al, 
2006) highlights the development of a database 
based on the hypothesis that an English verb is 
projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi. 
The simple idea of projecting POS tags across 
an English-Hindi parallel corpus considers the 
Complex Predicate types, adjective-verb (AV), 
noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and 
verb-verb (VV) composites. A similar task 
(Sinha, 2009) presents a simple method for 
detecting Complex Predicates of all kinds us-
ing a Hindi-English parallel corpus. His simple 
strategy exploits the fact that Complex Predi-
cate is a multi-word expression with a meaning 
that is distinct from the meaning of the Light 
Verb. In contrast, the present task carries the 
identification of Complex Predicates (CPs) 
from monolingual Bengali corpus based on 
morphological information and lexical pat-
terns. 
The analysis of V+V complex predicates 
termed as lexical compound verbs (LCpdVs) 
and the linguistic tests for their detection in 
Hindi are described in (Chakrabarti et al, 
2008). In addition to compound verbs, the pre-
sent system also identifies the conjunct verbs 
in Bengali. But, it was observed that the identi-
fication of Hindi conjunct verbs that contain 
noun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore a 
sophisticated solution was proposed in (Das, 
2009) based on the control agreement strategy 
with other overtly case marked noun phrases. 
The present task also agrees with the above 
problem in identifying conjunct verbs in Ben-
gali although the system satisfactorily identi-
fies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs). 
Paul (2003) develops a constraint-based 
mechanism within HPSG framework for com-
posing Indo-Aryan compound verb construc-
tions with special focus on Bangla (Bengali) 
compound verb sequences. Postulating seman-
tic relation of compound verbs, another work 
(Paul, 2009) proposed a solution of providing 
lexical link between the Full verb and Light 
Verb to store the Compound Verbs in Indo 
WordNet without any loss of generalization. 
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first 
attempt at automatic extraction of Complex 
Predicates (CPs) in Bengali.  
3 Identification of Complex Predi-
cates (CPs) 
The compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct 
verbs (ConjVs) are identified from the shallow 
parsed result using a lexical pattern matching 
technique. 
3.1 Preparation of Corpora 
Two types of Bengali corpus have been con-
sidered to carry out the present task. One cor-
pus is collected from a travel and tourism do-
main and another from an online web archive 
of Rabindranath Rachanabali 2 . Rabindra 
Rachanabali corpus is a large collection of 
short stories of Rabindranath Tagore. The for-

mer EILMT travel and tourism corpus is ob-
tained from the consortium mode project ?De-
velopment of English to Indian Languages 
Machine Translation (EILMT 3) System?. The 
second type of corpus is retrieved from the 
web archive and pre-processed accordingly. 
Each of the Bengali corpora contains 400 and 
500 development and test sentences respec-
tively.   
The sentences are passed through an open 
source Bengali shallow parser 4. The shallow 
parser gives different morphological informa-
tion (root, lexical category of the root, gender, 
number, person, case, vibhakti, tam, suffixes 
etc.) that help in identifying the lexical patterns 
of Complex Predicates (CPs).  
3.2 Extracting Complex Predicates (CPs) 
Manual observation shows that the Complex 
Predicates (CPs) contain the lexical pattern 
{[XXX] (n/adj) [YYY] (v)} in the shallow 
parsed sentences where XXX and YYY repre-
sent any word. But, the lexical category of the 
root word of XXX is either noun (n) or adjec-
tive (adj) and the lexical category of the root 
word of YYY is verb (v). The shallow parsed 
sentences are pre-processed to generate the 
simplified patterns. An example of similar 
lexical pattern of the shallow parsed result and 
its simplified output is shown in Figure 1.  
 
((NP  a????  NN  <fs 
?f='a???? ,n,,sg,,d,?? ? ,?? ? '>  ))              
   
((VGF  ???????      VM       <fs 
?f='?r,v,,,5,,? ,? '>     )) 
a???? |no?n|a???? /NN/NP/ 
(a???? ^n^*^sg^*^d^?? ^?? ? )_ 
???????|v??b|???????/VM/VGF/              
(?r^v^*^*^1^*^? ^? )

parsed result.

The corresponding lexical categories of the 
root words a???? adhyan ?study? (e.g. noun 
for ?n?) and '?r  kar, ?do? (e.g. verb for ?v?) are 
shown in bold face in Figure 1. The f ollowing 
example is of conjunct verb (ConjV).  
The extraction of Bengali compound verbs 
(CompVs) is straightforward rather than con-
junct verbs (ConjVs). The lexical pattern of 
compound verb is {[XXX](v) [YYY] (v)} where 
the lexical or basic POS categories of the root 
words of  ?XXX? and ?YYY? are only verb. If 
the basic POS tags of the root forms of ?XXX? 
and ?YYY? are verbs (v) in shallow parsed sen-
tences, then only the corresponding lexical 
patterns are considered as the probable candi-
dates of compound verbs (CompVs).  
Example 1: 
??i??|v??b|??i??/VM/VGNF/? ? ^v^*^*^?ny^*^i??^i??)
#??????|v??b|??????/VM/VGF/(??^v^*^*^1^*^?^?) 
Example 1 is a compound verb (CompV) but 
Example 2 is not. In Example 2, the lexical 
category or the basic POS of the Full Verb 
(FV) is noun (n) and hence the pattern is dis-
carded as non-compound verb (non-CompV). 
Example 2: 
?k? |noun|?k? /NN/NP/(?k? ^n^*^*^*^*^*^pos
lcat="NM") #  
?????|verb|?????/VM/VGNF/(?r^v^*^*^any^*^i??
^i??) 
Bengali, like any other Indian languages, is 
morphologically very rich. Different suffixes 
may be attached to a Light Verb (LVs) (in this 
case [YYY]) depending on the various features 
such as Tense, Aspect, and Person.  
In case of extracting compound verbs 
(CompVs), the Light Verbs are identified from 
a seed list (Paul, 2004). The list of Light Verbs 
is specified in Table 1. The dictionary forms of 
the Light Verbs are stored in this list. As the 
Light Verbs contain different suffixes, the pri-
mary task is to identify the root forms of the 
Light Verbs (LVs) from shallow parsed result. 
Another table that stores the root forms and the 
corresponding dictionary forms of the Light 
Verbs is used in the present task. The table 
contains a total number of 378 verb entries 
including Full Verbs (FVs) and Light Verbs 
(LVs). The dictionary forms of the Light Verbs 
(LVs) are retrieved from the Table. 
On the other hand, the conjunctive particip-
ial form -e/i?? -e/iya or the infinitive form -
? /i?? ?te/ite are attached with the Full Verbs 
40
(FVs) (in this case [XXX]) in compound verbs 
(CompVs). i?? / iya and i??/ ite are also used 
for conjunctive participial form -e ?e or the 
infinitive form -?  ?te respectively in litera-
ture. The participial and infinitive forms are 
checked based on the morphological informa-
tion (e.g. suffixes of the verb) given in the 
shallow parsed results. In Example 1, the Full 
Verb (FV) contains -i?? -iya suffix. If the dic-
tionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) are pre-
sent in the list of Light Verbs and the Full 
Verbs (FVs) contain the suffixes of -e/i?? -
e/iya or ? /i?? ?te/ite, both verbs are combined 
to frame the patterns of compound verbs 
(CompVs). 
 
aSa ?come?          d?Ra ?stand? 
rakha ?keep?       ana ?bring?  
deoya ?give?        pOra ?fall?  
paTha ?send?       bERano ?roam? 
neoya ?take?        tola ?lift? 
bOSa ?sit?           oTha ?rise? 
jaoya ?go?           chaRa ?leave? 
phEla ?drop?       mOra ?die? 
 
Table 1. List of Light Verbs for compound 
verbs. 
The identification of conjunct verbs 
(ConjVs) requires the lexical pattern (Noun / 
Adjective + Light Verb) where a noun or an 
adjective is followed by a Light Verb (LV). The 
dictionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) that 
are frequently used as conjunct verbs (ConjVs) 
are prepared manually. The list of Light Verbs 
(LVs) is given in Table 2. The detection of 
Light Verbs (LVs) for conjunct verbs (ConjVs) 
is similar to the detection of the Light Verbs 
(LVs) for compound verbs (CompVs) as de-
scribed earlier in this section.  If the basic POS 
of the root of the first words ([XXX]) is either 
?noun? or ?adj? (n/adj) and the basic POS of 
the following word ([YYY]) is ?verb? (v), the 
patterns are considered as conjunct verbs 
(ConjVs). The Example 2 is an example of 
conjunct verb (ConjV). 
For example, ???? ??? (jhakjhak kara ?to 
glow?), ???? ??? (taktak ?to glow?), ?? ??? ??? 
(chupchap kara ?to silent?) etc are identified as 
conjunct verbs (ConjVs) where the basic POS 
of the former word is an adjective (adj) fol-
lowed by ??? kara ?to do?, a common Light 
Verb.  
deoya ?give?        kara  ?do?    
neoya ?take?        laga  ?start?            
paoya ?pay?         kata  ?cut?   
  
Table 2. List of Light Verbs for conjunct verbs. 
 
Example 3:  
  ????|?dj|???? /JJ/JJP/(???? ^?dj) # 
????|v??b|????/VM/VGF/(?r^v^*^*^5^*^?^?) 
But, the extraction of conjunct verbs 
(ConjVs) that have a ?noun+verb? construction 
is descriptively and theoretically puzzling 
(Das, 2009). The identification of lexical pat-
terns is not sufficient to recognize the com-
pound verbs (CompVs). For example, ?i ? ??? 
boi deoya ?give book? and ???? ? ??? bharsa 
deyoa ?to assure? both contain similar lexical 
pattern (noun+verb) and same Light Verb ? ??? 
deyoa. But, ???? ? ??? bharsa deyoa ?to assure? 
is a conjunct verb (ConjV) whereas ?i ? ??? boi 
deoya ?give book? is not a conjunct verb 
(ConjV). Linguistic observation shows that the 
inclusion of this typical category into conjunct 
verbs (ConjVs) requires the additional knowl-
edge of syntax and semantics.  
In connection to conjunct verbs (ConjVs), 
(Mohanty, 2010) defines two types of conjunct 
verbs (ConjVs), synthetic and analytic. A syn-
thetic conjunct verb is one in which both the 
constituents form an inseparable whole from 
the semantic point of view or semantically 
non-compositional in nature. On the other 
hand, an analytic conjunct verb is semantically 
compositional. Hence, the identification of 
conjunct verbs requires knowledge of seman-
tics rather than only the lexical patterns. 
It is to be mentioned that sometimes, the 
negative markers (?? no, ??i nai) are attached 
with the Light Verbs u?????  uthona ?do not get 
up? ? ?????  phelona ?do not throw?. Negative 
attachments are also considered in the present 
task while checking the suffixes of Light Verbs 
(LVs). 
4 Identification of Lexical Scope for 
Complex Predicates (CPs) 
The identification of lexical scopes of the 
Complex Predicates (CPs) from their succes-
sive sequences shows that multiple Complex 
41
Predicates (CPs) can occur in a long sequence. 
An automatic method is employed to identify 
the Complex Predicates (CPs) along with their 
lexical scopes. The lexical category or basic 
POS tags are obtained from the parsed sen-
tences. 
If the compound and conjunct verbs occur 
successively in a sequence, the left most two 
successive tokens are chosen to construct the 
Complex Predicate (CP). If successive verbs 
are present in a sequence and the dictionary 
form of the second verb reveals that the verb is 
present in the lists of compound Light Verbs 
(LV), then that Light Verb (LV) may be a part 
of a compound verb (CompV). For that reason, 
the immediate previous word token is chosen 
and tested for its basic POS in the parsed result. 
If the basic POS of the previous word is ?verb 
(v)? and any suffixes of either conjunctive par-
ticipial form -e/i?? -e/iya or the infinitive form 
-? /i?? ?te/ite is attached to the previous verb, 
the two successive verbs are grouped together 
to form a compound verb (CompV) and the 
lexical scope is fixed for the Complex Predi-
cate (CP).  
If the previous verb does not contain -e/i?? 
-e/iya or -? /i?? ?te/ite inflections, no com-
pound verb (CompV) is framed with these two 
verbs. But, the second Light Verb (LV) may be 
a part of another Complex Predicate (CP). This 
Light Verb (LV) is now considered as the Full 
Verb (FV) and its immediate next verb is 
searched in the list of compound Light Verbs 
(LVs) and the formation of compound verbs 
(CompVs) progresses similarly.  If the verb is 
not in the list of compound Light Verbs, the 
search begins by considering the present verb 
as Full Verb (FV) and the search goes in a 
similar way. 
The following examples are given to illus-
trate the formation of compound verbs 
(CompVs) and find the lexical scopes of the 
compound verbs (CompVs). 
 
???      ????       ????     ???      ? ??? 
(ami)       (chalte)      (giye)    (pore)    (gelam). 
I <fell down while walking>. 
 
Here, ?chalte giye pore gelam? is a verb 
group. The two left most verbs ???? ???? chalte 
giye are picked and the dictionary form of the 
second verb is searched in the list of com-
pound Light Verbs. As the dictionary form 
(jaoya ?go?) of the verb ???? giye is present in 
the list of compound Light Verbs (as shown in 
Table 1), the immediate previous verb ???? 
chalte is checked for inflections -e/i?? -e/iya 
or -? /i?? ?te/ite.  As the verb ???? chalte con-
tains the inflection -?  -te , the verb group ???? 
???? chalte giye is a compound verb (CompV) 
where ???? giye is a Light Verb and ???? chalte 
is the Full Verb with inflection (-?  -te).  Next 
verb group, ???   ? ??? pore gelam is identified 
as compound verb (CompV) in a similar way 
(??+ (-e) por+ (-e) + ? ??? gelam (jaoya ?go?)).  
Another example is given as follows.  
 
???    u??      ???       ? ????       ?   
(ami)   (uthe)      (pore)      (dekhlam)    (je)  
?? ??      e????        ? i 
(tumi)     (ekhane)       (nei) 
I <get up and saw> that you are not here 
 
Here, u?? ??? ? ???? uthe pore dekhlam is 
another verb group. The immediate next verb 
of u?? uthe is ??? pore that is chosen and its 
dictionary form is searched in the list of com-
pound Light Verbs (LV) similarly. As the dic-
tionary form (???  pOra) of the verb ??? pore 
is present in the list of Light Verbs and the 
verb u??   uthe contains the inflection -e ?e, 
the consecutive verbs frame a compound verb 
(CompV) u?? ??? where u?? uthe is a Full Verb 
with inflection -e ?e and ??? pore is a Light 
Verb. The final verb ? ????      dekhlam is 
chosen and as there is no other verb present, 
the verb ? ???? dekhlam is excluded from any 
formation of compound verb (CompV) by con-
sidering it as a simple verb.  
Similar technique is adopted for identifying 
the lexical scopes of conjunct verbs (ConjVs). 
The method seems to be a simple pattern 
matching technique in a left-to-right fashion 
but it helps in case of conjunct verbs (ConjVs). 
As the noun or adjective occur in the first slot 
of conjunct verbs (ConjVs) construction, the 
search starts from the point of noun or adjec-
tive. If the basic POS of a current token is ei-
ther ?noun? or ?adjective? and the dictionary 
form of the next token with the basic POS 
?verb (v)? is in the list of conjunct Light Verbs 
(LVs), then the two consecutive tokens are 
42
combined to frame the pattern of a conjunct 
verb (ConjV). 
For example, the identification of lexical 
scope of a conjunct verb (ConjV) from a se-
quence such as u????  ???? ? ??? uparjon korte 
gelam ?earn-do-go? (went to earn) identifies 
the conjunct verb (ConjV) u????  ???? uparjon 
korte. There is another verb group ???? ? ??? 
korte gelam that seems to be a compound verb 
(CompV) but is excluded by considering ?? ??? 
gelam as a simple verb. 
5 Evaluation 
The system is tested on 800 development sen-
tences and finally applied on a collection of 
500 sentences from each of the two Bengali 
corpora. As there is no annotated corpus avail-
able for evaluating Complex Predicates (CPs), 
the manual evaluation of total 1000 sentences 
from the two corpora is carried out in the pre-
sent task.  
The recall, precision and F-Score are con-
sidered as the standard metrics for the present 
evaluation. The extracted Complex Predicates 
(CPs) contain compound verb (CompV) and 
conjunct verbs (ConjVs). Hence, the metrics 
are measured for both types of verbs individu-
ally. The separate results for two separate cor-
pora are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 respec-
tively. The results show that the system identi-
fies the Complex Predicates (CPs) satisfacto-
rily from both of the corpus. In case of Com-
pound Verbs (CompVs), the precision value is 
higher than the recall. The lower recall value 
of Compound Verbs (CompVs) signifies that 
the system fails to capture the other instances 
from overlapping sequences as well as non-
Complex predicates (non-CPs).  
But, it is observed that the identification of 
lexical scopes of compound verbs (CompVs) 
and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) from long se-
quence of successive Complex Predicates 
(CPs) increases the number of Complex Predi-
cates (CPs) entries along with compound verbs 
(CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs). The 
figures shown in bold face in Table 3 and Ta-
ble 4 for the Travel and Tourism corpus and 
Short Story corpus of Rabindranath Tagore 
indicates the improvement of identifying lexi-
cal scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs).  
In comparison to other similar language 
such as Hindi (Mukerjee et al, 2006) (the re-
ported precision and recall are 83% and 46% 
respectively), our results (84.66% precision 
and 83.67% recall) are higher in case of ex-
tracting Complex Predicates (CPs). The reason 
may be of resolving the lexical scope and han-
dling the morphosyntactic features using shal-
low parser.  
In addition to Non-MonoClausal Verb 
(NMCV) or Serial Verb, the other criteria 
(Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are used in our pre-
sent diagnostic tests to identify the complex 
predicates (CPs). The frequencies of 
Compound Verb (CompV), Conjunct Verb 
(ConjV) and the instances of other constraints 
of non Complex Predicates (non-CPs) are 
shown in Figure 2. It is observed that the num-
bers of instances of Conjunct Verb (ConjV), 
Passives (Pass), Auxiliary Construction (AC) 
and Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial 
Verb are comparatively high than other in-
stances in both of the corpus.

The error analysis is conducted on both of 
the corpus. Considering both corpora as a 
whole single corpus, the confusion matrix is 
developed and shown in Table 5. The bold face 
figures in Table 5 indicate that the percentages 
of non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs) such as 
Non-MonoClausal Verbs (NMCV), Passives 
(Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) that 
are identified as compound verbs (CompVs). 
The reason is the frequencies of the non-
Complex Predicates (non-CPs) that are rea-
sonably higher in the corpus.  In case of con-
junct verbs (ConjVs), the Non-MonoClausal 
Verbs (NMCV) and Auxiliary Construction 
(AC) occur as conjunct verbs (ConjVs).  The 
system also suffers from clausal detection that 
is not attempted in the present task. The Pas-
sives (Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) 
requires the knowledge of semantics with ar-
gument structure knowledge. 
6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have presented a study of 
Bengali Complex Predicates (CPs) with a spe-
cial focus on compound verbs, proposed auto-
matic methods for their extraction from a cor-
pus and diagnostic tests for their evaluation. 
The problem arises in case of distinguishing 
Complex Predicates (CPs) from Non-Mono-
Clausal verbs, as only the lexical patterns are 
insufficient to identify the verbs. In future task, 
the subcategorization frames or argument 
structures of the sentences are to be identified 
for solving the issues related to the errors of 
the present system.
