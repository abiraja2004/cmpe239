MEASURENIiNT OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN NOUNS 
I. INTRODUCTION 
One of the goals of studies in Distributional Semantics 
is the establishment of word classes on the basis of the 
observed behavior of words in written texts. A convenient 
and significant way of discussing "behavior" of words is 
in terms of syntactic relationship. At the outset, in 
fact, it is necessary that we treat a word in terms of its 
Syntactically Related Words (SRW). In a given text, each 
word bears a given syntactic relationship to a finite num- 
ber of other words; e.g., a finite number of words (nouns 
and pronouns) appear as "subject" for each active verb; 
another group of nouns and pronouns are used as "direct 
object" of each transitive verb; other words of the class, 
"adverb," appear as modifiers of a given verb. In each 
instance we may speak of the related words as SRW of a given 
verb, so that in our example three different ~ of SRW 
emerge; a given SRW is then defined in terms both of word 
class and specific relationship to the verb. (A given noun 
may of course belong to two different types of SRW, e.g., 
as both subject and object of the same verb.) 
Distributionally, we may compare two verbs in terms 
of their SRN. The objective of the present study is to 
test the premise that "similar" words tend to have the same 
SRW. This premise is tested, not with verbs, as in the 
l , a rper  
above  example ,  but  w i th  nouns .  Our procedure  i s  ( i )  to  f ind  
in  a g iven  text  th ree  types  of  SRW for  a smal l  g roup  o f  
nouns ,  (2) to  f ind  the  number o f  Sill; T shared  by each  pa i r  
of  nouns  fo rmed f rom the  group ,  and (3) to  express  the  
"s imi la r i ty"  between ind iv idua l  nouns)  and groups  of  nouns ,  
as a funct ion  o f  the i r  shared  SRI~. Another  example :  i t  
might  tu rn  out  that  in  a g iven  text  the  nouns  "a"  and "b"  
( "avocado"  and "cher ry" )  share  such  ad jec t ive  mod i f ie rs  as 
" r ipe , "  whereas  nouns "c )' and "d"  ( "cha i r "  and " fu rn i tu re" )  
have in  common the  ad jec t ive  mod i f ie r  "modern . "  These  
fac ts  would lead  us to  conc lude  that  "a"  and "b"  a re  s imi -  
la r ,  that  "c"  and "d"  a re  s imi la r )  that  "a"  and "c"  a re  
less  s imi la r ,  e tc .  
A number of  quest ions  a r i se :  What i s  "s imi la r i ty"  
anyway? Do words that  a re  s imi la r  in  mean ing  rea l ly  share  
a s ign i f i cant  number o f  SRW in  a g iven  text?  What i s  "a 
s ign i f i cant  number"?  Do not  d i ss imi la r  words a l so  have  many 
common SRW? flow much text  i s  necessary  in  o rder  to  es tab-  
l i sh  pat terns  o f  word behav ior?  What i s  the  e f fec t  o f  
mu l t ip le=mean ing  in  words ,  and of  us ing,  texts  f rom d i f fe r  = 
ent  sub jec t  a reas?  The present  invest igat ion  shou ld  be 
regarded  as an exper iment  des igned  to  th row some l ight  on 
these  quest ions ;  no va l id i ty  i s  c la imed fo r  the  " resu l t s "  
obta ined .  Our audac i ty  in  a t tempt ing  the  exper iment  a t  a l l  
i s  based  on three  fac tors :  the  possess ion  of a text  in  a 
l im i ted  f ie ld  (phys ics ) ,  the  fo reknowledge  that  the  mul t ip le  = 
l l a rper  3 
meaning probler: l  is  min in la l ,  and the  capab i l i ty  fo r  automat ic  
p rocess ing  of  text .  (The la t te r  i s  c lear ly  a necess i ty ,  
in v iew o? the  s i ze  and complex i ty  o f  the  prob lem. )  The 
reader  may we l l  conc lude  that  the exper iment  proves  noth ing .  
We would hope,  however ,  that  such an op in ion  would not  
p rec lude  a c r i t i ca l  judgment  of the procedures  employed,  
or the  suspens ion  of  d i sbe l ie f  i f  the resu l t s  do not  
cor respond wi th  h i s  expectat ions .  
2. PROCIiDIIRI'\] 
Tile p resent  s tudy  was based on a ser ies  of  a r t i c les  
from Russ ian  phys ics  journa ls ,  compr is ing  approx imate ly  
120)000 runn ing  words (some 500 pages) .  The process inp ,  of  
th i s  te.xt has been descr ibed  e l sewhere ,  (1 '2 )  l te re ,  we 
note  on ly  that  each sentence  of th i s  text  i s  recorded  
on magnet ic  tape ,  together  wi th  the fo l low ing  in fo rmat ion  
fo r  each occur rence  in  the  sentence :  i t s  par t  o f  speech ,  
i t s  "word number" (an ident i f i ca t ion  number in the machine 
g lossary} ,  and i t s  syntact i c  "governor"  or  "dependent"  
( i?  any) in the  sentence .  A re t r ieva l  program app l ied  to  
th i s  text  tape  then  y ie lded  in fo rmat ion  about  the SRI'i fo r  
words in which we were in teres ted .  For  conven ience  and 
economy, a l l  words in the  machine pr in tout  fo r  th i s  s tudy  
are  ident i f ied  by word number, ra ther  than  in  the i r  "natura l -  
l anguage"  ?o rv). 
In our s tudy  we chose to dea l  wit\]~ the SRI~ of fo r ty  
Russ ian  nouns ,  here in  ca l led  Test  ~ords {TW). The number 
l ta rper  4 
is  complete ly  a rb i t ra ry ;  t i le par t i cu la r  nouns chosen  (see 
Table 1) a'ere presumed to form d i f fe rent  semant ic  g roup ings .  
Table 1 g ives  one poss ib le  group ing  of  these  words;  the  
c r i te r ia  fo r  g roup ing  are more or less  obv ious ,  a l though 
the reader  may eas i ly  form d i f fe rent  g roups ,  by expand ing  
or cont ract ing  the groups that  we have des ignated .  The 
on ly  purpose  of  g roup ing  is  to prov ide  a weak measure of 
cont ro l  in the  exper iment :  i f  two nouns are found to be 
s imi la r  in terms of  the i r  SRN, we shou ld  l i ke  to  compare 
th i s  f ind ing  w i th  some in tu i t i ve  unders tand ing  of the i r  
s imi la r i ty .  (For  conven ience ,  we sha l l  re fe r  to the  'rWs 
by the i r  Eng l i sh  equ iva lents . )  
Two nouns may be compared wi th  re ference  to severa l  d i f -  
fe rent  types  of SRW. i le re ,  we have chosen  to i im i t  our 
compar i son  to th ree  types :  t.t}e ad jec t ive  dependents  ( in  
e i ther  a t t r ibut ive  or p red icat ive  funct ion) ,  the  noun 
depend.ents (normal ly ,  but  not  necessar i l y ,  in  the  gen i t ive  
case in Russ ian) ,  and the  noun governors  ( the  TN is  nor -  
ma l ly ,  but  not  necessar i l y ,  in  t i le gen i t ive  case) .  S t r i c t ly  
speak ing ,  the  syntact i c  funct ion  of  the SRIq shou ld  be taken  
in to  account .  In ignor ing  th i s  fac tor ,  we are consc ious ly  
permi t t ing  cer ta in  inexact i tudes ,  on the premise  that  the  
d i s to r t ions  in t roduced in to  measurement  w i l l  not  be severe .  
The task  o f  manua l iy  re t r iev ing  SRW for  each occur rence  
of  the 40 TWs, and of  compar ing each TW wi th  every  o ther  
TW, i s  too ted ious  to be a t tempted .  The a id  of  the computer  
was en l i s ted ,  in two ways,

i. Through automatic scanning of the text, each 
occurrence of tile 40 TWs was located, and in each instance 
the identity (word number) of relevant SR~V was recorded. 
A listing is produced for each of the TWs (see Table 2, 
"SRW Detail," for an example of the TW, VYCISLENIE = calcu- 
lation 1), showing tile different words used as adjective 
dependents (List i), noun dependents (List 2), and noun 
governors (List 3). Tile number of words on each of these 
lists is also shown in Table i, together with the total 
number of SRW for each TW (List 4). We stress the fact that 
these numbers refer to different words used as SRW; the 
repetition of a given SRW (for a given SRW type) was not 
recorded. 
2. Each Tl~ was automatically compared with every other 
TW, with respect to their shared SRW, i.e., in terms of 
the words i~ Lists I, 2, and 3 of the "SRW Detail Listing." 
A new listing, "Similarity Ranking by T%~'," is then produced 
(see Table 3 for the T~, VYCISLENIE = calculationl). This 
listing shows for each TW the number of shared SRW of each 
of the three types (NI, N2, and N3, Table 3), the total 
number of shared SR%~ (NA), and a measure of similarity for 
the pairs, herein designated as the Similarity Coefficient 
(SC). The SC is a decimal fraction obtained by dividing 
the sum of shared SRW for each pair of TWs by the product 
of the frequencies of the two TWs. (The latter is of course 
a device for taking into account the differing frequencies

of the TWs; other means for determining this coefficient 
can be utilized.) The pairings for each TW are ordered on 
the value of the SC. It should be noted that the similarity 
between TWs is measured in terms of the total number of 
shared SRW (Column NA of Table 3); it is also possible to 
express this measurement in terms of shared SRW of any 
single type. 
A third listing was also produced: a listing of the 
7,~I) TI~'-pairs, ordered oll the value of the SC. This listing, 
not reproduced here because of its length, will be referred 
to as "Ranking of TW-Pairs by SC~." 'Fable 4 shows the dis- 
tribution of the SC as compared with tile number of TW pairs. 
The following discussion is based on the three list- 
ings described above. A few additional remarks may be 
made about the procedure itself, which may be likened to 
deep-sea fishing with a tea strainer full of holes. The 
limitations of size are obvious: we have limited ourselves 
to three of the numerous ways of comparing nouns in terms 
of their SRW. Other types of SRW that suggest themselves 
are :  verbsj where TW is subject; verbs, where TW is direct 
object; prepositional phrases as dependents, or governors, 
of TW; nouns joined to TW through coordinate conjunctions 
(i.e., "apples" and "grapes" are said to be more similar if 
"apples and oranges" and "grapes and oranges" occur in 
text). Some of the holes in our tea strainer are: the 
neglect of the case of the noun dependent of TW, or the

The eva luat ion  of  the data  conta ined  in  our  th ree  
machine l i s t in~.s  i s  not  an easy  task .  We can scarce ly  
examine and d iscuss  the  degrees  of s i r .~ i la r i ty  of 780 noun-  
pa i rs .  The prob lem of in terpretat ion  is  a l so  compl ica ted :  
how complete ly  and accurate ly  shou ld  the resu l t s  cor res -  
pond with our  expectat ions ,  as represented  in the  tentat ive  
semant ic  g roup ings  (Table  1)? Our approach i s  to dea l  in 
a summary manner with the  noun-pa i rs  character i zed  by 
highest Similarity Coefficients, especially with respect to 
their intra- and inter-group relationships. Before proceeding 
to this discussion, a few preliminary remarks should be 
made about the data in the various machine listings. 
The summary of SRW counts for each TW, contained in 
Table I, suggests all TWs do not have the same opportunity 
for comparison. In the case of "correspondence" (Group 3), 
t la rper  12 
a total of only three SRW is noted in (Column 14); as a 
result, this TW should be eliminated from furtJler consider- 
ation. In addition, unless at least two, and preferably 
all three, types of SRW are well represented for a given 
TW, the SC for that noun will tend to be skewed. As

At which point on the curve shall we draw a line, saying 
that an SC above this value indicates similarity, a~d 
that an SC below this value indicates dissimilarity or 
weak similarity (all this of course: in terms of rcliability)? 
For purposes of discussion, we propose to set the t\]~reshold 
at .00100--a rigorously high figure. After eliminating 
pairs whose NA value is less than 4, we find 38 p,~irs whose 
SC lies in the range .00100 to .01~337 (Table 5). (Z\],e first 
two zeroes are dropped.) 
The reader may draw his own conclusions about the 
degree of similarity between the nouns in any given pair- 
ing. For purposes of discussion, we will refer to the 
pairings in terms of our preliminary groupings (Table I). 
The following intra- and inter-Group pairings are observed 
in Tab le 5 : 
Nouns of Group 1 pair with nouns of Group I, 2

We note that no pairings appear for nouns of Groups 3 
and 8. All other groups except Group 4 are represented by 
intra-group pairings; to this degree, our expectations 
are fulfilled, i.e., the data supports our a priori feel- 
ings for the similarity between words. The amount of inter-

group pairing may indicate either that the data is incon- 
clusive, or that our original groupings were too narrow. 
In fact, two larger groups emerge: one composed of Groups 
1 and 2 (perhaps including Group 1O), the other composed 
of Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7. This tendency is more marked 
if we lower the SC threshold from .00100 to .00070, 
thereby adding a total of 28 pairs to the number listed in 
Table 5. For example, nouns of Group 1 are found to pair 
with those of Group 10, and nouns of Group 4 pair with 
those of Groups 6 and 7. 
The data is not statistically conclusive, but strongly 
suggests the emergence of the two major groups mentioned 
above. The amalgamation of Groups 1 and 2 can easily be 
defended on semantic grounds; since Group 10, as noted 
above, is subject to aberrant behavior (because of the very 
high number of noun dependents), its inter-relation with 
Groups 1 and 2 may not be taken seriously. Groups 4, 5, 
6, and 7, which include the names of chemical mixtures, 
classes of elements, individual elements, and components of 
elements, may be taken together semantically as a single 
sub-class of "object nouns." The physicist tends to say the 
same things about all nouns in this group. 
One of tile 38 pairs listed in Table 5 appears to con- 
tradict expectation: "l iquid"/"problem"(Groups 5 and Ii). 
I t  shou ld  a l so  be noted  that  the  noun dependents  o f  
Group i0 nouns serve a "subjective" rather than "objective" 
function. If we had distinguished between the syntactic 
function of the noun dependent, TWs of Group I0 would be only 
weakly similar to TWs of Groups 1 and 2. 
l l a rper  16 
Tile four  SRW shared  by those  two nouns inc lude  the  ad jec t ive  
"cer ta in"  and the noun governor  "number . "  The non-d isc r im-  
inatory  ( "promiscuous" )  nature  of  these  two SRW is  perhaps  
obv ious ,  and one o f  the  re f ine laents  that  shou ld  be in t ro -  
duced in fu ture  s tud ies  is  the  neg lec t  o f  such words as 
"s ign i f i cant"  SRI~. (Tile s tudy  of "promiscu i ty"  in ad jec -  
t i ves  is  re fe r red  to in Re ference  4. )  At the  present ,  
exper ience  suggests  that  d i s to r t ions  in t roduced  by such 
words a re  min imal  i f  the  number of  SRW is  su f f i c ient ly  la rge .  
Our genera l  conc lus ion  is  that ,  w i th  a few anomal ies ,  
the 66 pairings for which the SC Is .00700 or higher 
meet with our expcctations. 
Another aspect of the question remains: many nouns 
with presumed similarity arc not represented on the high 
end of the SC distribution curve. (If we lower the thresh- 
old to include such pairs we shall also encounter many 
non-similar pairs.) One way of dealing with this problem 
is to consider the most highly correlated pairs that nouns 
in each Group form, whether or not the SC is "signifi- 
cantly" high. In lieu of presenting this information in 
full detail, we show in Table 6 the most closely correlated 
pairs for a representative noun from each of the Groups 
(excepting Groups 3, 4, and 8). 
The most striking aspect of Table 6 is the repetition 
of intra- and inter-Group pairings noted in Table S for 
high-SC pairings. In other words, the relative value of

the  SC appears  to  be as s ign i f i cant  as the  abso lu te  va lue .  
Th is  resu l t  was cer ta in ly  not  expected ,  and perhaps  ind i -  
ca tes  a greater  sens i t i v i ty  in  our  measurement  procedures  
than  we would  have thought  reasonab le .  
Table 6 suggests, but does not prove, the existence 
of clusters (or "clumps") of T~s, in which the members are 
closely correlated with each other, and in which no member 
is closely correlated to any outside word. lee have not 
yet attempted to apply clumping procedures; a better 
understanding of the data is perhaps a prerequisite to this 
rigorous treatment. For the present, we shall point out 
a phenomenon that strongly suggests the existence of 
clumps: the recurrence of the same SRI~ ~ among several TWs 
with high mutual correlation. Consider, for example, that 
a h igh  5C i s  found between Test  Words A and B) B and C, 
and A and C; i f ,  in  add i t ion ,  a re la t ive ly  h igh  propor t ion

Of these ,  one ha l f  (n ine)  a l so  appeared  as SRW for  both 
determinat ion  and measurement .  I t  would seem that  the 
" togetherness"  of  these  three  TWs is  s t rengthened by th i s  
feature ,  which we term " recur rence  of  SR;V." We have no 
ready fo rmula  fo r  determin ing  that  recur rence  is  or is  not  
significant in a given situation. In general, the nature and 
behavior of individual SRIV remain to be studied, so far as 
their relevance to our problem is concerned. 
4. CONCLUS IONS 
We conclude that there is considerable agreement 
between the results of our experiment and an a priori feel- 
ing for the similarity of words. Words that are similar 
in meaning tend to have the same SRI',' t to a far greater 
degree than chance would determine. If this conclusion is 
valid, a large-scale experiment is suggested, using a 
larger number of Test Words, more SRW types, and a larger 
t la rper  2 0 
amount of  text .  (The text  base fo r  t i le p resent  exper iment  
proved to be adequate ;  la rger  amounts of  text  shou ld ,  
however ,  remove some of  the  anomal ies . )  The quest ion  of  
fu r ther  re f inements  in  the  procedure  must a l so  be taken  
ser ious ly :  e .g . ,  we may a l so  take  in to  account  mul t ip le  
occur rences  of  an SRW, d i s t ingu ish  to some degree  the  d i f -  
fe rent  funct ions  of  noun governors  or noun dependents ,  d i s -  
count  the  occur rence  of  "promiscuous"  SRIV. ( : lumping 
procedures  shou ld  be app l ied ,  perhaps  tak ing  in to  account  
the  recur rence  of  ind iv idua l  SRW among a group of Tes t  
Words.
