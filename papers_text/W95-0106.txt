Abstract 
We describe two new strategies to automatic bracketing of parallel corpora, with particular appli- 
cation to languages where prior grammar resources are scarce: (1) coarse bilingual grammars, and (2) 
unsupervised training of such grammars via EM (expectation-maximization). Both methods build upon a 
formalism we recently introduced called stochastic inversion transduction grammars. The first approach 
borrows acoarse monolingual grammar into our bilingual formalism, in order to transfer knowledge of 
one language's constraints to the task of bracketing the texts in both languages. The second approach 
generalizes the inside-outside algorithm to adjust he grammar parameters so as to improve the likelihood 
of a training corpus. Preliminary experiments on parallel English-Chinese text are supportive of these 
strategies. 
1 Introduction 
A number of empirical studies have found bracketing to be a useful type of corpus annotation (e.g., Pereira 
& Schabes 1992; Black et al 1993). Bracketed corpora have been available for some time in English, 
and to some extent other European languages, the best-known example being perhaps the Penn Treebank 
(Marcus 1991). However, at present bracketed corpora for Chinese are unknown, as is the case for many 
other languages. Moreover, even for better-studied languages, parallel bracketed texts are scarce. 
The problem of bracketing such corpora is the focus of two new strategies described in this paper. The 
strategies build upon stochastic inversion transduction grammars (SITGs), a formalism that we have been 
developing for bilingual anguage modeling. Numerous experiments have shown parallel bilingual corpora 
to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al 1990; Gale & Church 1991 ;
Gale et al 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al 1993; Dagan et al 1993; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; 
Fung & McKeown 1994). SITGs are a generalization of context-free grammars that have several desirable 
properties for parallel corpus analysis; a brief summary of these properties i given in Section 2. 
Our first strategy is to expropriate a very simple, coarse monolingual grammar of English as the backbone 
for a bilingual English-Chinese SITG, which is then used for bracketing parallel text. The effect of this is 
to transfer knowledge of English syntactic onstraints (or more precisely, probabilistic preferences) to the 
bilingual task. This is discussed in Section 3. 
Our second strategy is to apply an unsupervised training algorithm to tune the probabilistic parameters 
of the SITG. For this purpose we have devised an EM-based algorithm, a bilingual generalization of the 
69 
inside-outside method, that iteratively improves the likelihood of the training corpus. This is discussed in 
Section 4. 
It is important to stress at the outset that aparallel bracketed corpus is different from a bracketed parallel 
corpus. The latter is simply a parallel corpus in which both halves have been independently bracketed. In 
contrast, in a parallel bracketed corpus, the bracketed sub-constituents are themselves parallel in the sense 
that explicit matching relationships are designated between sub-constituents of each half. This is a much 
more interesting kind of annotation if it can be accomplished, especially for machine translation applications. 
2 Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars 
In Wu (1995b) we define an inversion tranduction grammar (ITG) formalism for bilingual anguage mod- 
eling, i.e., modeling of two languages (referred to as L1 and L2) simultaneously. The description here is 
necessarily brief; for further details the reader is referred to Wu (1995a, 1995b). 
An ITG is a context-free grammar that generates output on two separate streams, together with a matching 
that associates the corresponding tokens and constituents of each stream. The formalism also differs from 
standard context-free grammars inthat the concatenation peration, which is implicit in any production rule's 
right-hand side, is replaced with two kinds of concatenation with either straight or inverted orientation. Thus, 
the following are two distinct productions in an ITG: 
C ~ \[AB\] 
c (A B) 
Consider each nonterminal symbol to stand for a pair of matched strings, so that for example (A1, A2) 
denotes the string-pair generated by A. The operator \[\] performs the "usual" pairwise concatenation so that 
\[AB\] yields the string-pair (C1, C2) where C1 = AiB~ and C~ = A2B2. But the operator () concatenates 
constituents on output stream 1 while reversing them on stream 2, so that C1 = A~B~ but C2 = B2A2. 
The inverted concatenation perator permits the extra flexibility needed to accommodate many kinds of 
word-order variation between source and target languages. Since inversion is permitted at any level of rule 
expansion, a derivation may intermix productions of either orientation within the parse tree. More on the 
ordering flexibility will be said later. 
There are also lexical productions of the form: 
A --~ x/y 
where x and y am symbols of languages L1 and L2, respectively. Either or both x and y may take the special 
value E denoting an empty string, allowing a symbol of either language to have no counterpart in the other 
language by being matched to an empty string. We call x/~ an Ll-singleton and c/y an L2-singleton. 
Parsing, in the context of ITGs, means to take as input a sentence-pair rather than a sentence, and to 
output a parse tree that imposes a shared hierarchical structuring on both sentences. For example, Figure 1 
shows a parse tree for an English-Chinese s ntence translation. The English is mad in the usual depth-first 
left-to-right order, but for the Chinese, a horizontal line means the right subtree is traversed before the left, 
so that the following sentence pair is generated: 
(1) a. \[\[\[The Authority\]Np \[will \[\[be accountable\]vv \[to \[the \[\[Financial Secretary\]NN \] NN \]iP \]PP \]VP 
\]vv \]sv ./o \]s 
b. \ [ \ [ \ [~/~\ ]NP  \ [N~ \[\[~1 \ [ \ [ \ [~  NNN \]NNN \]Ne \]eP \ [ t~\]VV \]VP \]VP \]SP ./o IS 
Alternatively, we can show the common structure of the two sentences more compactly using bracket notation 
with the aid of the () operator:

where the horizontal line from Figure 1 corresponds tothe () level of bracketing. 
A stochastic inversion transduction grammar is an ITG where a probability is associated with each 
production, subject to the constraint that 
(ai_\[jk\] + ai~(jk)) + Z bi(x,y) = 1 
l_<j,k<N l_<x<Wa 
l<y<W2 
where ai_..~\] = P( i  ~ \[jk\]li), bi(x, y) = P( i  ~ x/yl i) ,  W1 and W2 are the vocabulary sizes of the two 
languages, and N is the number of nonterrninal categories. 
Under the stochastic formulation, the objective of parsing is to find the maximum-likelihood parse for a 
given sentence pair. A general algorithm for this is given in Wu (1995b). 
The following convenient theorem isproved in Wu (1995b), which indicates that any ITG can be converted 
to a normal form, where all productions are either lexical productions or binary-fanout productions: 
Theorem 1 For any inversion transduction grammar G, there exists an equivalent inversion transduction 
grammar G' in which every production takes one of the following forms: 
S ---~ e/e A ~ x/e A ~ \[BC\] 
A ~ x /y  A ~ e/y A ~ (BC)  
71 
A \[A A\] 
A (A A} 
A ~ ui/vj 
A ui/E 
bej A ~ e/vj 
for all i, j English-Chinese l xical translations 
for all i English vocabulary 
for all j Chinese vocabulary 
Figure 2: A simple constituent-matching ITG.
The algorithms inthis paper assume that ITGs are in this normal form, with one slight relaxation. Lexical 
productions of the form A ~ x/y may generate multiple-word sequences, i.e., x and g may each be more 
than one word. This does not affect he generative power, but allows probabilities to be placed on collocation 
translations. The form is called lexical normal form. 
ITGs impose two desirable classes of constraints on the space of possible matchings between sentences. 
Crossing constraints prohibit arrangements where the matchings between subtrees cross each another, unless 
the subtrees' immediate parent constituents are also matched to each other. Aside from linguistic motivations 
stemming from the compositionality principle, this constraint isimportant for computational reasons, to avoid 
exponential bilingual matching times. Fanout constraints limit the number of direct sub-constituents of any 
single constituent, i.e., the number of subtrees whose matchings may cross at any level. We have shown 
that ITGs inherently permit nearly free matchings for fanouts up to four, with strong constraints hereafter 
creating a rapid falloff in the proportion of matchings permitted (Wu 1995a). This characteristic gives ITGs 
just the right degree of flexibility needed to map syntactic structures interlingually. 
3 Coarse Bilingual Grammars 
Because the expressiveness of ITGs naturally constrains the space of possible matchings in a highly appro- 
priate fashion, the possibility arises that the information supplied by a word-translation lexicon alone may be 
adequately discriminating to match constituents, without language-specific monolingual grammars for the 
source and target languages, imply by bringing the ITG constraints obear in tandem with lexical matching. 
That is, the bilingual SITG parsing algorithm can perform constituent identification and matching using only 
a generic, language-independent bracketing rammar. 
Several earlier experiments (Wu 1995a) tested out variants of this hypothesis, using generic SITGs similar 
to the one shown in Figure 2, which employs only one nonterminal category. The first two productions 
are sufficient to generate all possible matchings of ITG expressiveness (this follows from the normal form 
theorem). The remaining productions are all lexical. Productions of the A --+ ui/v~ form list all word 
translations found in the translation lexicon, and the others list all potential singletons without corresponding 
translations. Thus, a parser with this grammar can build a bilingual parse tree for any possible ITG matching 
on a pair of input sentences. 
Probabilities on the grammar are placed as follows. The bii distribution encodes the English-Chinese 
translation lexicon with degrees of probability on each potential word translation. A small e-constant can be 
chosen for the probabilities bl, and b,i, so that the optimal matching resorts to these productions only when it 
is otherwise impossible to match the singletons. The result is that the maximum-likelihood parser selects the 
parse tree that best meets the combined lexical translation preferences, asexpressed by the bij probabilities. 
Performance, as reported in Wu (1995a), was encouraging, with precision on automatically-filtered

sentence pairs in the 80% range with the aid of supporting heuristics. However, there are of course inherent 
limitations of any approach that relies entirely on crossing- and fanout-constrained l xical matching. In 
particular, if the sub-constituents of any constituent appear in the same order in both languages, lexical 
matchings do not provide the discriminative leverage to identify the sub-constituent boundaries. This applies 
to both straight and inverted orientations; an example with inverted orientation is shown in Figure 3. In such 
cases, specific grammatical information about one or both of the languages i needed. 
Grammatical information is far less easily available for Chinese than for English, however, with respect 
to part-of-speech lexicons as well as grammars. The SITG formalism offers another possibility: the generic 
bracketing rammar can be replaced with a context-free backbone designed for English. 
It is critical under this approach that the English grammar be reasonably robust. It should also avoid 
being too specific, since to be effective at bracketing, its structure must accomodate Chinese to a reasonably 
broad extent. For these reasons it is best o employ a simple, coarse grammar, with fallback productions that 
simulate the generic bracketing rammar when the English productions are too inflexible. 
As before, the lexical productions will constitute the bulk of the rules set. However, we can now distin- 
guish between different part-of-speech nonterminals. Different part-of-speech nonterminals may generate 
the same words. We can accomodate he fact that no Chinese part-of-speech lexicon is available with 
noninformative distributions as follows: 
1. The conditional distribution over L ~ ui/e productions i estimated from the frequencies for each 
English part-of-speech L. 
2. The conditional distribution over L ~ ui/v# productions i estimated from the frequencies for the 
English part-of-speech L uniformly distributed over the set of matching Chinese words. 
3. The conditional distribution over L ~ ~/v~ productions i uniformly distributed over the Chinese 
vocabulary.

Because the grammar is coarse while the lexicon is fine, the approach retains the previous approach's high 
sensitivity to lexical matching constraints. 
It is interesting toconstrast this method with the "parse-parse-match" approaches that have been reported 
recently for producing parallel bracketed corpora (Sadler & Vendelmans 1990; Kaji et al 1992; Matsumoto 
et al 1993; Cranias et al 1994; Gfishman 1994). "Parse-parse-match" methods first bracket aparallel corpus 
by parsing each half individually using a monolingual grammar. 1 Heuristic procedures are subsequently 
used to select a matching between the bracketed constituents across sentence-pairs. These approaches 
can encounter difficulties with incompatibilities between the monolingual grammars used to parse the 
texts. The grammars will usually be of unrelated origins, not designed to make interlingual matching easy. 
Furthermore, how to deal with ambiguities presents another serious problem. Most sentences in the corpus 
will have multiple possible parses. In a pure "parse-parse-match" approach, however, the monolingual 
parsers must arbitrarily select one bracketing with which to annotate the corpus. The resulting parse may 
be incompatible with the parse chosen for the other half of the sentence-pair, causing amatching error even 
though some alternative parse might in fact been compatible. 
The coarse bilingual grammar approach proposed here solves these problems by choosing the parse 
a Of course, this assumes that adequate grammars are available for both languages, contrary toour present assumptions.

structure for both sentences simultaneously with the interlingual constituent matching criteria. The weighting 
of the bracketing constraints and matching constraints i probabilistic. Even if a sentence pair's translations 
truly contain structural mismatches that are beyond syntactic accounts, the soft constraint optimization 
permits graceful degradation i the bilingual parse. The parser will attempt to match those constituents for 
which a partial decomposition a d matching can be found, parsing the rest largely according to the English 
grammar backbone. 
More sophisticated "parse-parse-match" procedures postpone ambiguity resolution until the matching 
stage (Kaji et al 1992; Matsumoto et al 1993; Grishman 1994). This tactic bears closer resemblance to
our approach, but still requires ad hoc heuristics to determine exactly how the matching task influences the 
monolingual parses that are chosen. On the other hand, the present framework incorporates all these aspects 
within a single probabilistic optimization. 
Another alternative approach discussed in Wu (1995b) is to first use a monolingual grammar to bracket 
only the English half of the text, followed by a SITG parallel bracketing procedure constrained by the English 
brackets. However, this hybrid approach is subject o the same incompatibility and ambiguity problems that 
arise for pure "parse-parse-match" procedures; thus the proposed coarse bilingual grammar approach is 
superior for the same reasons given above. 
For our experiments, we employed the grammar shown in Figures 4 and 5, with only 50 syntactic 
productions and 13 nonterminal categories, including 6part-of-speech ategories. Each syntactic production 
occurs in both straight and inverted orientations, to model ignorance of the ordering tendencies of the 
corresponding Chinese constituents. The part-of-speech ategories were designed by conflating categories 
in the Brown corpus tagset, under the following general principle: categories should be as broad as possible, 
while still maintaining reasonable discriminativeness forbracketing structure. Thus, notice that adjectives 
and nouns are conflated, since complex nominal phrases have largely similar parse structures regardless of 
75 
the difference between adjective and noun labels. Similarly, all verbs including auxiliaries are grouped to 
allow simple tail-recursive compounding. The S category (not to be confused with the start symbol SO) is a 
placeholder for miscellaneous items including punctuation and adverbs, and functions as a fallback category 
similar to the A nonterminal in the generic bracketing rammars. 
Probabilities were placed on the syntactic productions uniformly, but all inverted productions were

assigned a slightly smaller probability in order to break ties in favor of straight matchings. Probabilities were 
placed on the lexical productions as discussed above, with the following additional provisions. The translation 
lexicon was automatically earned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical 
sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; 
Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994). The latter 
stage gives us the lexical translation probabilities. The translation lexicon contained approximately 6,500 
English words and 5,500 Chinese words, and was not manually corrected for this experiment, having about 
86% translation accuracy. The English part-of-speech lexicon with relative frequencies was derived from 
the English portion of our corpus as tagged by Brill's (1993) tagger. 
Our preliminary experiments show improved parsing behavior in general, compared to generic bracketing 
grammars. Examples of the output are shown in Figure 6. The latter example shows problematic behavior on 
the example given earlier in Figure 3 of sentence pairs without sufficient ordering discrimination. Although 
an attempt is made in this case to fit the English constraints, the main difficulty is that the translation "so/~ 
~"  was missing from the automatically-learned lexicon; also, the simple grammar lacks infinitival clauses. 
4 An EM Algorithm for Training SITGs 
An unavoidable consequence of using more structured, complex grammars--coarse though they may be--is 
that the bilingual matching process becomes more sensitive to the syntactic production probabilities than 
under the earlier generic bracketing rammar approaches. Performance therefore suffers if the probabilities 
are not appropriate, a serious problem given that the syntactic production probabilities above are manually, 
and arbitrarily, set to be uniform. 
It therefore becomes desirable to find means to tune the syntactic production probabilities automatically, 
so as to be optimal with respect to some training data set. Note that we do not expect he parallel training 
corpus to be parsed or otherwise syntactically annotated beforehand. To this end we present an EM 
(expectation-maximization) algorithm for iteratively improving the syntactic production parameters of a 
SITG, according to a likelihood criterion. The method is a generalization f the inside-outside algorithm for 
SCFG estimation (Baker 1979; Lari & Young 1990). 
A few notational preliminaries: we will denote the sentence pairs by (E, C) where the English sentence 
E -- e l , . . . ,  eT and the corresponding Chinese sentence C = c l , . . .  , ev are vectors of observed symbols 
(that is, lexemes or words). As an abbreviation we write e~..t for the sequence of words e~+~, e~+2,.. . ,  et, 
and similarly for ~..~. It will be convenient touse a 4-tuple of the form q = (s, t, u, v) to identify each node 
of the parse tree, where the substrings es..t and c~..~ both derive from the node q. Denote the nonterminal 
label on q = (s, t, u, v) by gq or ?stu~, with the convention that ?~t~ = 0 means that e,..t and e~..~ are not 
derived from a single common onterminal. 
The inside probabilities, defined as:

The estimation procedure for adjusting the model parameter set ff is defined in terms of the inside and outside

The behavior f a typical training run is shown in Figure 7. The relative movement ofthe log likelihood 
is what is important here. The absolute magnitudes are not meaningful since they are largely determined 
by the fixed lexical translation probabilities. What is significant isthat due to the relatively small number 
of parameters being trained, convergence is achieved within two or three iterations. (The rise in perplexity 
afterwards i  caused by numerical error on overtrained parameters; we terminate raining as soon as this 
occurs.)

5 Conclusion 
We have described two new approaches toautomatic bracketing of parallel corpora, which are particularly 
applicable to languages where grammar resources are scarce. The methods---coarse bilingual grammars 
expropriated from monolingual grammars, with EM parameter stimation--are grounded upon a firm theo- 
retical model, and preliminary experiments show promising behavior. The training method oes not require 
syntactically annotated parallel corpora, which are difficult to obtain. We are presently conducting more 
quantitative evaluations of the bracketing performance improvement.
