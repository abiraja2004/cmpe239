Abstract 
This paper introduces new specificity de-
termining methods for terms using com-
positional and contextual information. 
Specificity of terms is the quantity of 
domain specific information that is con-
tained in the terms. The methods are 
modeled as information theory like meas-
ures. As the methods don?t use domain 
specific information, they can be applied 
to other domains without extra processes. 
Experiments showed very promising re-
sult with the precision of 82.0% when the 
methods were applied to the terms in 
MeSH thesaurus. 
1. Introduction 
Terminology management concerns primarily 
with terms, i.e., the words that are assigned to 
concepts used in domain-related texts. A term is 
a meaningful unit that represents a specific con-
cept within a domain (Wright, 1997). 
Specificity of a term represents the quantity of 
domain specific information contained in the 
term. If a term has large quantity of domain spe-
cific information, specificity value of the term is 
large; otherwise specificity value of the term is 
small. Specificity of term X is quantified to posi-
tive real number as equation (1). 
( )Spec X R+?                      (1) 
Specificity of terms is an important necessary 
condition in term hierarchy, i.e., if X1 is one of 
ancestors of X2, then Spec(X1) is less than 
Spec(X2). Specificity can be applied in automatic 
construction and evaluation of term hierarchy.  
When domain specific concepts are repre-
sented as terms, the terms are classified into two 
categories based on composition of unit words. In 
the first category, new terms are created by add-
ing modifiers to existing terms. For example ?in-
sulin-dependent diabetes mellitus? was created 
by adding modifier ?insulin-dependent? to its 
hypernym ?diabetes mellitus? as in Table 1. In 
English, the specific level terms are very com-
monly compounds of the generic level term and 
some modifier (Croft, 2004). In this case, compo-
sitional information is important to get their 
meaning. In the second category, new terms are 
created independently to existing terms. For ex-
ample, ?wolfram syndrome? is semantically re-
lated to its ancestor terms as in Table 1. But it 
shares no common words with its ancestor terms. 
In this case, contextual information is used to 
discriminate the features of the terms.

Contextual information has been mainly used 
to represent the characteristics of terms. (Cara-
ballo, 1999A) (Grefenstette, 1994) (Hearst, 1992) 
(Pereira, 1993) and (Sanderson, 1999) used con-
textual information to find hyponymy relation 
between terms. (Caraballo, 1999B) also used 
contextual information to determine the specific-
ity of nouns. Contrary, compositional informa-
tion of terms has not been commonly discussed. 
                                                          
1 MeSH is available at  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh. MeSH 2003 was used 
in this research. 
We propose new specificity measuring meth-
ods based on both compositional and contextual 
information. The methods are formulated as in-
formation theory like measures. Because the 
methods don't use domain specific information, 
they are easily adapted to terms of other domains. 
This paper consists as follow: compositional 
and contextual information is discussed in section 
2, information theory like measures are described 
in section 3, experiment and evaluation is dis-
cussed in section 4, finally conclusions are drawn 
in section 5. 
2. Information for Term Specificity 
In this section, we describe compositional infor-
mation and contextual information. 
2.1. Compositional Information 
By compositionality, the meaning of whole term 
can be strictly predicted from the meaning of the 
individual words (Manning, 1999). Many terms 
are created by appending modifiers to existing 
terms. In this mechanism, features of modifiers 
are added to features of existing terms to make 
new concepts. Word frequency and tf.idf value 
are used to quantify features of unit words. Inter-
nal modifier-head structure of terms is used to 
measure specificity incrementally. 
We assume that terms composed of low fre-
quency words have large quantity of domain in-
formation. Because low frequency words appear 
only in limited number of terms, the words can 
clearly discriminate the terms to other terms. 
tf.idf, multiplied value of term frequency (tf) 
and inverse document frequency (idf), is widely 
used term weighting scheme in information re-
trieval (Manning, 1999). Words with high term 
frequency and low document frequency get large 
tf.idf value. Because a document usually dis-
cusses one topic, and words of large tf.idf values 
are good index terms for the document, the words 
are considered to have topic specific information. 
Therefore, if a term includes words of large tf.idf 
value, the term is assumed to have topic or do-
main specific information. 
If the modifier-head structure of a term is 
known, the specificity of the term is calculated 
incrementally starting from head noun. In this 
manner, specificity value of a term is always lar-
ger than that of the base (head) term. This result 
answers to the assumption that more specific 
term has larger specificity value. However, it is 
very difficult to analyze modifier-head structure 
of compound noun. We use simple nesting rela-
tions between terms to analyze structure of terms. 
A term X is nested to term Y, when X is substring 
of Y (Frantzi, 2000) as follows: 
 
Definition 1 If two terms X and Y are terms in 
same category and X is nested in Y as W1XW2, 
then X is base term, and W1 and W2 are modifiers 
of X. 
 
For example two terms, ?diabetes mellitus? 
and ?insulin dependent diabetes mellitus?, are all 
disease names, and the former is nested in the 
latter. In this case, ?diabetes mellitus? is base 
term and ?insulin dependent? is modifier of ?in-
sulin dependent diabetes mellitus? by definition 1. 
If multiple terms are nested in a term, the longest 
term is selected as head term. Specificity of Y is 
measured as equation (2). 
1 2( ) ( ) ( ) ( )Spec Y Spec X Spec W Spec W? ?= + ? + ? (2) 
where Spec(X), Spec(W1), and Spec(W2) are 
specificity values of X, W1, W2 respectively. ?  
and ? , real numbers between 0 and 1, are 
weighting schemes for specificity of modifiers. 
They are obtained experimentally. 
2.2. Contextual Information 
There are some problems that are hard to address 
using compositional information alone. Firstly, 
although features of ?wolfram syndrome? share 
many common features with features of ?insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus? in semantic level, 
they don?t share any common words in lexical 
level. In this case, it is unreasonable to compare 
two specificity values measured based on compo-
sitional information alone. Secondly, when sev-
eral words are combined to a term, there are 
additional semantic components that are not pre-
dicted by unit words. For example, ?wolfram 
syndrome? is a kind of ?diabetes mellitus?. We 
can not predict ?diabetes mellitus? from two 
separate words ?wolfram? and ?syndrome?. Fi-
nally, modifier-head structure of some terms is 
ambiguous. For instance, ?vampire slayer? might 
be a slayer who is vampire or a slayer of vam-
pires. Therefore contextual is used to comple-
ment these problems. 
Contextual information is distribution of sur-
rounding words of target terms. For example, the 
distribution of co-occurrence words of the terms, 
the distribution of predicates which have the 
terms as arguments, and the distribution of modi-
fiers of the terms are contextual information. 
General terms usually tend to be modified by 
other words. Contrary, domain specific terms 
don?t tend to be modified by other words, be-
cause they have sufficient information in them-
selves (Caraballo, 1999B). Under this assumption, 
we use probabilistic distribution of modifiers as 
contextual information. Because domain specific 
terms, unlike general words, are rarely modified 
in corpus, it is important to collect statistically 
sufficient modifiers from given corpus. Therefore 
accurate text processing, such as syntactic pars-
ing, is needed to extract modifiers. As Cara-
ballo?s work was for general words, they 
extracted only rightmost prenominals as context 
information. We use Conexor functional depend-
ency parser (Conexor, 2004) to analyze the struc-
ture of sentences. Among many dependency 
functions defined in Conexor parser, ?attr? and 
?mod? functions are used to extract modifiers 
from analyzed structures. If a term or modifiers 
of the term do not occur in corpus, specificity of 
the term can not be measured using contextual 
information 
3. Specificity Measuring Methods 
In this section, we describe information theory 
like methods using compositional and contextual 
information. Here, we call information theory 
like methods, because some probability values 
used in these methods are not real probability, 
rather they are relative weight of terms or words. 
Because information theory is well known for-
malism describing information, we adopt the 
mechanism to measure information quantity of 
terms. 
In information theory, when a message with 
low probability occurs on channel output, the 
amount of surprise is large, and the length of bits 
to represent this message becomes long. There-
fore the large quantity of information is gained 
by this message (Haykin, 1994). If we consider 
the terms in a corpus as messages of a channel 
output, the information quantity of the terms can 
be measured using various statistics acquired 
from the corpus. A set of terms is defined as 
equation (3) for further explanation. 
{ |1 }kT t k n= ? ?                   (3) 
where tk is a term and n  is total number of terms. 
In next step, a discrete random variable X is de-
fined as equation (4). 
{ |1 }
( ) Prob( )
k
k k
X x k n
p x X x
= ? ?
= =                 (4) 
where xk is an event of a term tk occurs in corpus, 
p(xk) is the probability of event xk. The informa-
tion quantity, I(xk), gained after observing the 
event xk, is defined by the logarithmic function. 
Finally I(xk) is used as specificity value of tk as 
equation (5). 
( ) ( ) log ( )k k kSpec t I x p x? = ?        (5) 
In equation (5), we can measure specificity of 
tk, by estimating p(xk). We describe three estimat-
ing methods of p(xk) in following sections. 
3.1. Compositional Information based 
Method (Method 1) 
In this section, we describe a method using com-
positional information introduced in section 2.1. 
This method is divided into two steps: In the first 
step, specificity values of all words are measured 
independently. In the second step, the specificity 
values of words are summed up. For detail de-
scription, we assume that a term tk consists of one 
or more words as equation (6). 
1 2...k mt w w w=                       (6) 
where wi is i-th word in tk. In next step, a discrete 
random variable Y is defined as equation (7). 
{ |1 }
( ) Prob( )
i

Y y i m
p y Y y

= =                (7) 
where yi is an event of a word wi occurs in term tk, 
p(yi) is the probability of event yi. Information 
quantity, I(xk), in equation (5) is redefined as 
equation (8) based on previous assumption.

where I(xk) is average information quantity of all 
words in tk. Two information sources, word fre-
quency, tf.idf are used to estimate p(yi). In this 
mechanism, p(yi) for informative words should 
be smaller than that of non informative words. 
When word frequency is used to quantify fea-
tures of words, p(yi) in equation (8) is estimated 
as equation (9).

where freq(w) is frequency of word w in corpus, 
PMLE(wi) is maximum likelihood estimation of 
P(wi), and j is index of all words in corpus. In 
this equation, as low frequency words are infor-
mative, P(yi) for the words becomes small. 
When tf.idf is used to quantify features of 
words, p(yi) in equation (8) is estimated as equa-
tion (10).

where tf?idf(w) is tf.idf value of word w. In this 
equation, as words of large tf.idf values are in-
formative, p(yi) of the words becomes small. 
3.2. Contextual Information based Method 
(Method 2)  
In this section, we describe a method using con-
textual information introduced in section 2.2. 
Entropy of probabilistic distribution of modifiers 
for a term is defined as equation (11). 
( ) ( , ) log ( , )mod k i k i k
i
H t p mod t p mod t= ??  (11) 
where p(modi,tk) is the probability of modi modi-
fies tk and is estimated as equation (12). 
( , )( , )

MLE i k

freq mod tp mod t
freq mod t
= ?      (12) 
where freq(modi,tk) is number of frequencies that 
modi modifies tk in corpus, j is index of all modi-
fiers of tk in corpus. The entropy calculated by 
equation (11) is the average information quantity 
of all (modi,tk) pairs. Specific terms have low en-
tropy, because their modifier distributions are 
simple. Therefore inversed entropy is assigned to 
I(xk) in equation (5) to make specific terms get 
large quantity of information as equation (13). 
1
( ) max( ( )) ( )k mod i mod ki nI x H t H t? ?? ?       (13) 
where the first term of approximation is the 
maximum value among modifier entropies of all 
terms. 
3.3. Hybrid Method (Method 3) 
In this section, we describe a hybrid method to 
overcome shortcomings of previous two methods. 
This method measures term specificity as equa-
tion (14).

where ICmp(xk) and ICtx(xk) are normalized I(xk) 
values between 0 and 1, which are measured by 
compositional and contextual information based 
methods respectively. (0 1)? ?? ?  is weight of two 
values. If 0.5? = , the equation is harmonic mean 
of two values. Therefore I(xk) becomes large 
when two values are equally large. 
4. Experiment and Evaluation 
In this section, we describe the experiments and 
evaluate proposed methods. For convenience, we 
simply call compositional information based 
method, contextual information based method, 
hybrid method as method 1, method 2, method 3 
respectively.  
4.1. Evaluation 
A sub-tree of MeSH thesaurus is selected for ex-
periment. ?metabolic diseases(C18.452)? node is 
root of the subtree, and the subtree consists of 
436 disease names which are target terms of 
specificity measuring. A set of journal abstracts 
was extracted from MEDLINE2 database using 
the disease names as quires. Therefore, all the 
abstracts are related to some of the disease names. 
The set consists of about 170,000 abstracts 
(20,000,000 words). The abstracts are analyzed 
using Conexor parser, and various statistics are 
extracted: 1) frequency, tf.idf of the disease 
names, 2) distribution of modifiers of the disease 
names, 3) frequency, tf.idf of unit words of the 
disease names. 
The system was evaluated by two criteria, 
coverage and precision. Coverage is the fraction 
                                                          
2 MEDLINE is a database of biomedical articles serviced by National Library 
of Medicine, USA. (http://www.nlm.nih.gov) 
of the terms which have specificity values by 
given measuring method as equation (15). 
#     
#

of all terms
=        (15) 
Method 2 gets relatively lower coverage than 
method 1, because method 2 can measure speci-
ficity when both the terms and their modifiers 
appear in corpus. Contrary, method 1 can meas-
ure specificity of the terms, when parts of unit 
words appear in corpus. Precision is the fraction 
of relations with correct specificity values as 
equation (16). 
#   ( , )   
#    ( , )

of all R p c
=  (16) 
where R(p,c) is a parent-child relation in MeSH 
thesaurus, and this relation is valid only when 
specificity of two terms are measured by given 
method. If child term c has larger specificity 
value than that of parent term p, then the relation 
is said to have correct specificity values. We di-
vided parent-child relations into two types. Rela-
tions where parent term is nested in child term 
are categorized as type I. Other relations are 
categorized as type II. There are 43 relations in 
type I and 393 relations in type II. The relations 
in type I always have correct specificity values 
provided structural information method described 
section 2.1 is applied. 
We tested prior experiment for 10 human sub-
jects to find out the upper bound of precision. 
The subjects are all medical doctors of internal 
medicine, which is closely related division to 
?metabolic diseases?. They were asked to iden-
tify parent-child relation of given two terms. The 
average precisions of type I and type II were 
96.6% and 86.4% respectively. We set these val-
ues as upper bound of precision for suggested 
methods.  
Specificity values of terms were measured 
with method 1, method 2, and method 3 as Table 
2. In method 1, word frequency based method, 
word tf.idf based method, and structure informa-
tion added methods were separately experi-
mented. Two additional methods, based on term 
frequency and term tf.idf, were experimented to 
compare compositionality based method and 
whole term based method. Two methods which 
showed the best performance in method 1 and 
method 2 were combined into method 3. 
Word frequency and tf.idf based method 
showed better performance than term based 
methods. This result indicates that the informa-
tion of terms is divided into unit words rather 
than into whole terms. This result also illustrate 
basic assumption of this paper that specific con-
cepts are created by adding information to exist-
ing concepts, and new concepts are expressed as 
new terms by adding modifiers to existing terms. 
Word tf.idf based method showed better preci-
sion than word frequency based method. This 
result illustrate that tf.idf of words is more infor-
mative than frequency of words. 
Method 2 showed the best performance, preci-
sion 70.0% and coverage 70.2%, when we 
counted modifiers which modify the target terms 
two or more times. However, method 2 showed 
worse performance than word tf.idf and structure 
based method. It is assumed that sufficient con-
textual information for terms was not collected 
from corpus, because domain specific terms are 
rarely modified by other words. 
Method 3, hybrid method of method 1 (tf.idf 
of words, structure information) and method 2, 
showed the best precision of 82.0% of all, be-
cause the two methods interacted complementary.

Table 2. Experimental results (%) 
The coverage of this method was 70.2% which 
equals to the coverage of method 2, because the 
specificity value is measured only when the 
specificity of method 2 is valid. In hybrid method, 
the weight value 0.8? =  indicates that composi-
tional information is more informatives than con-
textual information when measuring the 
specificity of domain-specific terms. The preci-
sion of 82.0% is good performance compared to 
upper bound of 87.4%.  
4.2. Error Analysis 
One reason of the errors is that the names of 
some internal nodes in MeSH thesaurus are cate-
gory names rather disease names. For example, 
as ?acid-base imbalance (C18.452.076)? is name 
of disease category, it doesn't occur as frequently 
as other real disease names. 
Other predictable reason is that we didn?t con-
sider various surface forms of same term. For 
example, although ?NIDDM? is acronym of ?non 
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus?, the system 
counted two terms independently. Therefore the 
extracted statistics can?t properly reflect semantic 
level information. 
If we analyze morphological structure of terms, 
some errors can be reduced by internal structure 
method described in section 2.1. For example, 
?nephrocalcinosis? have modifier-head structure 
in morpheme level; ?nephro? is modifier and 
?calcinosis? is head. Because word formation 
rules are heavily dependent on the domain spe-
cific morphemes, additional information is 
needed to apply this approach to other domains. 
5. Conclusions 
This paper proposed specificity measuring meth-
ods for terms based on information theory like 
measures using compositional and contextual 
information of terms. The methods are experi-
mented on the terms in MeSH thesaurus. Hybrid 
method showed the best precision of 82.0%, be-
cause two methods complemented each other. As 
the proposed methods don't use domain depend-
ent information, the methods easily can be 
adapted to other domains. 
In the future, the system will be modified to 
handle various term formations such as abbrevi-
ated form. Morphological structure analysis of 
words is also needed to use the morpheme level 
information. Finally we will apply the proposed 
methods to terms of other domains and terms in 
general domains such as WordNet.
