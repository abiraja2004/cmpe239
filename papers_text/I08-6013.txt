Abstract 
 
This paper presents the experiments of Language Technologies Research 
Centre (LTRC) as part of their participation in CLEF2 2007 Indian language 
to English ad-hoc cross language document retrieval task. In this paper we 
discuss our Hindi and Telugu to English CLIR system and the experiments 
using CLEF 2007 dataset. We used a variant of TFIDF algorithm in 
combination with a bilingual lexicon for query translation. We also explored 
the role of a document summary in fielded queries and two different boolean 
formulations of query translations. We find that a hybrid boolean 
formulation using a combination of boolean AND and boolean OR operators 
improves ranking of documents. We also find that simple disjunctive 
combination of translated query keywords results in maximum recall.
