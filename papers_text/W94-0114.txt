1. Summary 
We discuss implementation issues of 
MARIE-l, a mostly symbolic parser 
fully implemented, and MARIE-2, a 
more statistical parser partially imple- 
mented. They address a corpus of 
100,000 picture captions. We argue that 
the mixed approach of MARIE-2 should 
be better for this corpus because its 
algorithms (not data) are simpler. 
Subject areas: parser implementation, 
binary word correlation probabilities. 
2. Introduction 
Our MARIE project has been investigat- 
ing information retrieval of multimedia 
data using a new idea: putting primary 
emphasis on caption processing. 
Although content analysis methods uch 
as substring searching for text media 
and shape matching for picture media 
can obviate captions, content analysis 
usually requires unacceptably-large 
amounts of time at retrieval time. Cap- 
tions can be cachings of the results of 
content analysis, but they can also 
include auxiliary information like the 
date or customer for a photograph. 
Since captions can be considerably 
smaller than the media-data they 
describe, checking captions before 
retrieving media data can save time if it 
can rule out many bad matches quickly, 
the idea of "information filters" (Belkin 
and Croft, 1992). 
However, caption processing does not 
necessarily give faster multimedia 
retrieval. The terms of the caption are 
often synonyms or subterms of those 
supplied by a user during retrieval, so a 
complete thesaurus of synonyms and a 
complete type hierarchy of terms should 
be used during information retrieval 
(Smith et al 1989). Furthermore, to 
obtain high query recall and precision, 
natural-language processing of the cap- 
tions must be done to determine the 
word senses and how the words relate, 
to get beyond the well-known limits of 
112 
-2 -  
keyword matching (Krovetz and Croft, 
1992). This additional processing could 
be slow, so the MARIE project is con- 
cerned with methods of improving its 
efficiency in caption-based retrieval. 
This paper reports on an important 
direction that we have explored recently: 
mixing traditional symbolic parsing with 
probabilistic ranking based on a res- 
tricted kind of statistical information. 
Whi le  the MARIE project is intended 
for multimedia information retrieval in 
general, we have used as testbed the 
Photo Lab of the Naval Air Warfare 
Center (NAWC-WD), China Lake Cali- 
fornia USA. This is a library of 
approximately 100,000 pictures and 
37,000 captions for those pictures. The 
pictures cover all activities of the center, 
including pictures of equipment, ests of 
equipment, administrative documenta- 
tion, site visits, and public relations. 
With so many pictures, many of which 
looking virtually identical, captions are 
indispensable to find anything. But the 
existing computerized keyword system 
for finding pictures from their captions 
is unhelpful, and is mostly ignoredby 
personnel. (Rowe and Guglielmo, 1993) 
reports on MARIE-l, a prototype imple- 
mentation in Prolog that we developed 
for them, a system that appears much 
more in the direction of what users 
want. 
But MARIE-1 took a man-year to con- 
struct and only handled 220 pictures 
(averaging 20 words per caption) from 
the database. To handle the full data- 
base, efficiency and implementation- 
difficulty concerns have become 
paramount. MARIE-2, currently under 
development, will address these prob- 
lems by exploiting a large statistical- 
correlation database, allowing for 
simpler parse rules and fewer semantic 
routines. This should make it run more 
efficiently while being much easier to 
apply to the full captions database. This 
will provide an interesting test of statist- 
ical parsing ideas from an engineering 
standpoint. 
3. Example captions 
To illustrate the problems posed by the 
corpus, we present some example cap- 
tions. All are single-case. 
an/apq-89 xan-1 radar set in nose 
of t-2 buckeye modified aircraft 
bu# 7074, for flight evaluation test. 
3/4 overall view of aircraft on run- 
way. 
This is typical of many captions: two 
noun phrases, each terminated with a 
period, where the first describes the 
photographic subject and the second 
describes the picture itself. Also typical 
are the complex nominal-compound 
strings, "an/apq-89 xan-1 radar set" and 
"t-2 buckeye modified aircraft bu# 
7074". Domain knowledge, or statistics 
as we shall argue, is necessary to recog- 
nize "an/apq-89" as a radar type, "xan- 
I" a version number for that radar, "t-2" 
an aircraft ype, "buckeye" a slang addi- 
tional name for a T-2, "modified" a con- 
ventional adjective, and "bu# 7074" as 
an aircraft code ID.

3/4 front overall view and closeup 
1/4 front view of pod. 
This illustrates ome common domain- 
dependent noun-phrase syntax. "A-4c 
bu# 147781" is a common pattem of 
<equipment-type> <prefix-code> 
<code-number>, a pattern frequent 
enough to deserve its own grammar 
rule. Similarly "an/awg-16 fire control 
pod" is the common pattern of 
<equipment-name> <equipment- 
purpose> <equipment-type>, and "3/4 
front overall view" is of the form 
<view-qualifier> <view-qualifier> 
<view-type>. 
graphics presentation tid progress 
76. sea site update, wasp head 
director and hawk screech\[sun 
visor radars, tdp portion only, 
excellent. 
This illustrates the need for domain- 
dependent lexicon information. Here 
"wasp", "hawk", and "sun visor" should 
not be interpreted in their common 
English word senses, but as special 
equipment erms. Furthermore, "pro- 
gress 76" means "progress in 1976", and 
"excellent" refers to the quality of the 
picture. And the "head director" is not 
a person but a guidance system, and the 
"sea site" is not in the sea but a dry lak- 
ebed flooded with water to a few inches. 
Such unusual word senses strongly call 
for inference from domain-dependent 
statistics. They are also a good argu- 
ment lor natural-language processing for 
inforrnation retrieval instead of keyword 
matching.

This illustrates the problems with the 
misspellings and nonstandard abbrevia- 
tions in the captions. "Trf crcl" is sup- 
posed to be "traffic circle", "trngr' is tri- 
angle, "capehart b" is "capehart base", 
but "b to t" is "bottom to top". 
"Vieweg" which looks like a misspelling 
of "viewed" is actuaUy the correct name 
of a former base commander, but "inyo- 
dem" which looks correct actually is a 
misspelling of "Inyokem", a nearby 
town. Such abbreviations and misspel- 
lings can only be found by reference to 
known domain words and using heuris- 
tics.

This illustrates the difficulties of inter- 
preting the numerous acronyms in the 
captions. Here the first word of the 
above is an immediately-explained acro- 
nym; a careful search for such con- 
structs helps considerably, as often an 
acronym is explained in at least one 
114 
-4 -  
caption. But even explained acronyms 
cause difficulties. We can generally 
take the subject of the appositive phrase 
after the acronym as the type of the 
acronym, "system" in this case, but how 
the other words relate to it is compli- 
cated and less determined by conven- 
tional English syntax than the need to 
obtain a cute acronym. 
4. Our approach to statistical parsing 
MARIE-1 uses the standard approach of 
intelligent natural-language processing 
for information retrieval (Grosz et al 
1987; Rau, 1988; Sembok and van 
Rijsbergen, 1990) of hand-coding of 
lexical and semantic information for the 
words in a narrow domain. We used 
the DBG software from Language Sys- 
tems, Inc. (in Woodland Hills, CA) to 
help construct he parser for MARIE-1. 
Nonetheless, considerable additional 
work was needed to adapt DBG to our 
domain. Even though we focused on a 
random sample of only 220 captions, 
they averaged 50 words in length and 
required a lexicon and type hierarchy of 
1000 additional words beyond the 1000 
we could use from the prototype DBG 
application for cockpit speech. A large 
number of additional semantic rules had 
to be written for the many long and 
complicated noun-noun sequences that 
had no counterpart in cockpit speech. 
These required difficult debugging 
because DBG's multiple-pass emantic 
processing is tricky to figure out, and 
the inability of DBG to backtrack and 
find a second interpretation meant that 
we could only find a maximum of one 
bug per run. But hardest of all to use 
were DBG's syntactic features. These 
required a grammar with fixed assigned 
probabilities on each rule, which neces- 
sitated a delicate balancing act that con- 
sidered the entire corpus, to choose 
what was often a highly sensitive 
number. The lack of context sensitivity 
meant that this number had to pro- 
gramrned artificially for each rule to 
obtain adequate performance (for which 
some researchers have claimed success), 
instead of being taken from applicable 
statistics on the corpus, which makes 
more sense. But this "programming" 
was more trial-and-error than anything. 
MARIE-I's approach would be unwork- 
able for the 29,538 distinct words in the 
full 100,000-caption NAWC database. 
Statistical parsing has emerged in the 
last few years as an alternative. I t  
assigns probabilities of co-occurrence to
sets of words, and uses these probabili- 
ties to guess the most likely interpreta- 
tion of a sentence. The probabilities 
can be derived from statistics on a 
corpus, a representative s t of example 
sentences, and they can capture fine 
semantic distinctions that would other- 
wise require additional lexicon informa- 
tion. 
Statistical parsing is especially well 
suited for information retrieval because 
the goal of the latter is to find data that 
will probably satisfy a user, but satisfac- 
tion is never guaranteed. Also, good 
information retrieval does not require 
the full natural-language understanding 
115 
-5 -  
that hand-tailored semantic routines pro- 
vide: Understanding of the words 
matched is not generally helpful beyond 
their synonym, hierarchical type, and 
hierarchical part information. For 
instance, the query "missile mounted on 
aircraft" should match all three of: 
--"sidewinder on f-18" 
--"sidewinder attached to wing 
pylon" 
--pylon mounted aim-9m 
sidewinders" 
since "sidewinder" and "aim-9m" are 
types of missiles, "f-18" as a kind of 
aircraft, and "on" and "attached" mean 
the same thing as "mounted". NAWC- 
WD captions are often imprecise with 
verbs, so detailed semantic analysis of 
them is usually fruitless. Parsing is still 
essential to connect related words in a 
caption, as to recognize the similar deep 
structure of the three examples above. 
But a parser for information retrieval 
can have fewer grammatical categories 
and fewer rules than one for full 
natural-language understanding. 
Creating the full synonym list, type 
hierarchy, and part hierarchy for appli- 
cations of the size of the NAWC-WD 
database (42,000 words including words 
closely related to those in the captions) 
is considerable work. Fortunately, a 
large part of this job for any English 
application has been already accom- 
plished in the Wordnet system (Miller et 
a l ,  1990), a large thesaurus ystem that 
includes this kind of information, plus 
rough word frequencies and morphologi- 
cal processing. From Wordnet we 
obtained information for 6,843 words 
mentioned in the NAWC-WD captions 
(for 24,094 word-sense ntries), together 
with 15,417 "alias" facts relating other 
word senses to 24,094 as synonyms. 
(The alias facts shortened the lexicon by 
about 85%.) This left 22,~95 words in 
the captions that did not have available 
Wordnet data, for which we used a 
variety of methods to create lexicon 
entries. The full breakdown of the lexi- 
con was:  
Number of distinct words: 29,538 
Recognized by Wordnet: 6,843 
--Morphological variants of above 
words: 2,134 
--Related superconcepts, wholes, 
aliases, and phrases recognized by 
Wordnet: 12,294 
--Numbers: 3,718 
--Person names: 2,160 
--Place names: 246 
--Company names: 149 
--Words with unambiguous 
defined-code prefixes: 2,987 
--Miscellaneous identifiable special 
formats: 6,033 
--Identifiable misspellings: 826 
--Identifiable abbreviations: 928 
--Current domain-dependent 
explicitly-defined words (mostly 
from MARIE-l): 770 
--Current remaining unidentified 
words (90% equipment names): 
4,215 
The special-format rules do things like 
interpret "BU# 462945" as an aircraft 
identification umber and "02/21/93" as 
a date. Misspellings and abbreviations 
were obtained mostly automatically, 
with human checking, from rule-based 
116 
-6 -  
systemsdescr ibed in (Rowe and 
Laitinen, 1994). The effort for lexicon- 
building, although it is not yet complete, 
was relatively modest (0.25 of a man- 
year) thanks to Wordnet, which suggests 
good portability. Some of this success 
can be attributed to the restrictions of 
caption semantics. 
We converted all this information to a 
Quintus Prolog format compatible with 
the rest of MARIE-2, and used this in 
parsing and interpretation. The basic 
meaning assigned to a noun or verb is 
that it is a subtype of the concept 
designed by its name in the type hierar- 
chy, with additional pieces of meaning 
added by its relationships (like 
modification) to other words in the sen- 
tence. For instance, for "big missile on 
stand", a representative meaning list 
currently obtained is: 
\[a kind_of(v3 ,projectile- 1 ), 
property(v3,big- 1), 
locationover(v3,v5), 
a_kind__of(v5,base-2)\] 
where v3 and v5 are variables and the 
numbers after the hyphen indicate the 
word sense number. 
5. Statistical parsing techniques 
This approach can be fast since we just 
substitute standard synonyms for the 
words in a sentence, append the type 
and relationship specifications for all the 
nouns; verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, 
and resolve references using the parse 
tree, to obtain a "meaning list" or 
semantic graph, following the paradigm 
of (Covington, 1994) for the nonstatisti- 
cal aspects. But this can still be slow 
because it would seem we need to find 
all the reasonable interpretations of a 
sentence in order to rank them. To sim- 
plify matters, we restricted the grammar 
to binary parse rules (context-free rules 
with one or two symbols for the 
replacement). The likelihood of an 
interpretation can be found by assigning 
probabilities to word senses and rules. 
If we could assume near-independence 
of the probabilities of each part of the 
sentence, we could multiply them to get 
the probability of the whole sentence 
(Fujisaki et al 1991). This is 
mathematically equivalent to taking the 
sum of the logarithms of the probabili- 
ties, and hence a branch-and-bound 
search could be done to quickly find the 
N best parses of the a sentence. 
But words of sentences are obviously 
not often independent or near- 
independent. Statistical parsing often 
exploits the probabilities of strings of 
successive words in a sentence (Jones 
and Eisner, 1992). However, with 
binary parse rules, a simpler and more 
semantic idea is to consider only the 
probability of co-occurrence of the two 
subparses. For example, the probability 
of parsing "f-18 landing" by the rule 
"NP -> NP PARTICIPLEPHRASE" 
should include the likelihood of an F-18 
in particular doing a landing and the 
likelihood of this syntactic structure. 
The co-occurrence probability for "f-18" 
and "land" is especially helpful because 
it is unexpectedly arge, since there are 
only a few things in the world that land. 
117 
-7 -  
Estimates of co-occurrence probabilities 
can inherit in the type hierarchy (Rowe, 
1985). So if we have insufficient statis- 
tics in our corpus about how often an 
F-18 lands, we may enough on how 
often an aircraft lands; and assuming 
that F-18s are typical of aircraft in this 
respect, we can estimate how often F- 
18s land. The second word can be gen- 
eralized too, so we can use statistics on 
'T-18" and "moving", or both the words 
can be simultaneously generalized, so 
we can use statistics on "aircraft" and 
"moving". The idea is to find some 
statistics that can be reliably used to 
estimate the co-occurrence probability of 
the words. Each parse rule can have 
separate statistics, so the alternative 
parse of "f-18 landing" by "NP -> 
ADJECTIVE GERUND" would be 
evaluated by separate statistics. 
To keep this number of possible co- 
occurrence probabilities manageable, it
is important to restrict them to two- 
probability. When parse rules recognize 
multiword sequences as grammatical 
units, those sequences can be reduced to 
"headwords". For instance, "the big f- 
18 from china lake landing at armitage 
field" can also be parsed by "NP -> NP 
PARTICIPLEPHRASE" and the same 
co-occurrence probability used, since 
"f-18" is the principal noun and hence 
headword of the noun phrase "the big 
f-18 from china lake", and "landing" is 
the participle and hence headword of the 
participial phrase "landing at arrnitage 
field". We can get a measure of the 
interaction of larger numbers of words 
by multiplying the probabilities for al l  
such binary nodes of the parse tree. 
This is not an independence assumption 
anymore because an important word can 
appear as headword of many different 
syntactic units, and thus affect the 
overall rating of a parse in many places. 
A big advantage for us of statistical 
parsing is in identification of unknown 
words. As we noted earlier, our corpus 
has many equipment terms, geographical 
names, and names of people that are not 
covered by Wordnet. But for informa- 
tion retrieval, detailed understanding of
these terms is usually not required 
beyond recognizing their category, and 
this can be inferred by co-occurrence 
probabilities. For instance, in "person- 
nel mounting ghw-12 on an f-18", 
"ghw-12" must be a piece of equipment 
because of the high likelihoods of co- 
occurrence of equipment terms with 
"mount" and equipment terms with 
"on'. 
6. More about the statistical database 
We will obtain the necessary counts 
from running the parser on the 100,000 
captions. Using branch-and-bound 
search, the parser will find what it con- 
siders the most likely parse; if this is 
incorrect, a human monitor will say so 
and force it to consider the second most 
likely parse, and so on. Counts are 
incremented for each binary node in the 
parse tree, and also for all superconcepts 
of the words involved. As counts accu- 
mulate, the system should gradually 
become more likely to guess the correct 
118 
-8 -  
parse on its first try. 
The statistical database for binary co- 
occurrence statistics will need careful 
design because the data will be sparse 
and there will be many small entries. 
For instance, for the NAWC-WD cap- 
tions there are about 20,000 synonym 
sets about which we have lexicon infor- 
marion. This means 200 million possi- 
ble co-occurrence pairs, but the total of 
all their counts can only be 610,182, the 
total number of word instances in all 
captions. Our counts database uses four 
search trees indexed on the first word, 
the part of speech plus word sense of 
the first word, the second word, and the 
part of speech plus word sense of the 
second word. Stonng counts rather than 
probabilities aves storage and reduces 
work on update. Various compression 
techniques can further reduce storage, 
but especially the elimination of data 
that can be closely approximated from 
other counts using sampling theory 
(Rowe, 1985). For instance, if "f-18" 
occurs 10 times in the corpus, all kinds 
of aircraft occur 1000 times, and there 
are 230 occurrences of aircraft landing, 
estimate the number of "f-18 landing"s 
in the corpus as 230 * 10 / 1000 = 2.3; 
if the actual count is within a standard 
deviation of the Value, do not store it in 
the database. The standard deviation 
when n is the size of the subpopulation, 
N is the size of the population, and A 
the count for the population, is 
qA (N-A )(N-n )/nN2(N-1) (Cochran, 1977). 
Such calculations require also "unary" 
counts stored with each word or stan- 
dard phrase, but there are far fewer of 
these: (While unary counts also directly 
affect the likelihood of a particular sen- 
tence, that effect can be ignored since it 
is constant over all sentence interpreta- 
tions.) 
We need not store statistics for every 
word in the statistical database. Many 
words and phrases used in are corpus 
are codes that appear rarely, like air- 
plane ID numbers and dates. For such 
concepts, we only keep statistics on the 
superconcept, "ID number" and "date" 
for these examples. Which concepts are 
to be handled this way is domain- 
dependent, but generally simple. 
7. More about the restriction to 
binary probabilities 
It may seem inadequate to restrict co- 
occurrence probabilities to pairs of 
headwords. We argue that while this is 
inadequate for general natural-language 
processing, information retrieval in gen- 
eral and captions in particular are 
minimally affected. That is because the 
sublanguages of such applications are 
highly case-oriented, and cases are 
binary. So structures like subject- 
verbal-object can be reduced to verbal- 
subject and verbal-object cases; 
adjective 1-adjecfive2-noun can be 
reduced to two adjective-noun case rela- 
tionships, either separately with each 
adjective or by reducing adjectivel- 
adjecrive2 to a composite concept i f  
adjective2 can be taken as a noun. 
Prepositional phrases would seem to be 
trouble, however, because the preposi- 
119 
-9 -  
tion simultaneously interacts with both 
its subject and its object. We handle 
them by subclassifying prepositions as 
location, time, social, abstract, or mis- 
cellaneous, reflecting the main features 
that affect compatibility with subjects 
and objects. Then, say, a parse of "air- 
craft at nawc" retrieves only a high 
count if the preposition is a location and 
not time preposition, and so permits 
compatibility under those syntactically 
restricted circumstances of "nawc" and 
"aircraft". 
Another objection raised to binary pro- 
babilities is the variety of nonlocal 
semantic relationships the can occur in 
discourse. Captions at NAWC-WD are 
usually multi-sentence, and anaphora do 
occur which can usually be resolved by 
simple methods. More difficult is the 
problem of resolving multiple possible 
word senses. For "sidewinder on 
ground", are we talking about the snake 
or the missile? (NAWC-WD captions 
are all lower case.) The proper interpre- 
tation depends on whether the previous 
sentence was "flora and fauna of the 
china lake area" (NAWC-WD has many 
such pictures for public relations) or 
"loading sequence for a missile". We 
have three answers to this challenge. 
First, most of the words that have many 
multiple meanings in English are 
abstract or metaphorical, and not 
appropriate for use on captions. 
Second, when ambiguous words do 
occur, the odds are good that some 
immediate syntactic relationship will 
provide the necessary clues to resolving 
ambiguity; for instance, both 
"sidewinder mounted" and "sidewinder 
coiled" are unambiguous when using 
co-occurrence counts. Third, even if 
multiple interpretations cannot be ruled 
out for a word, an information retrieval 
system can just try each, and take the 
union of the results (i.e. as a logical dis- 
junction); generally only one interpreta- 
tion will every match a query. Note 
that if count statistics are derived from 
the same corpus that is subsequently 
used for retrieval, as MARIE-2 intends 
to do, the probabilities obtained from 
our parse will be a rough estimate of the 
yield (selectivity) of each interpretation.
