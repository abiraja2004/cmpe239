Abstract 
This paper examines the discourse fluic- 
tions that different types of subjects 
perform in Italian within the centering 
framework (Grosz el; al., 1995). I build 
on my previous work (Di gugenio, 1990) 
that accounted for the alternation of null 
and strong prottouns in subject position. 
I extend my previous atialysis in several 
wws: for examI)le, I refine the notion 
of CONTINUE altd discuss the centering 
functions of full NPs. 
1 Introduct ion 
hiterpreting referential expressions is importatlt 
for any large coverage NL system; while such sys- 
tems do exist for Italian, e.g. (Stock et al, 1993; 
Lombardo and Lesmo, 1994), to my knowledge 
not mudi attention has been devoted to the inter- 
pretation of Italian referential expressions. Some 
exceptions are (Samek-Lodovici and Strapparava, 
1990), that discusses interpretation of referential 
expressions within dialogues to access a videodisc 
on Italimi art; (Not and Zancanaro, 1995), that 
adopts a systemic gra,nmar approadi (Halliday, 
1976); and (Di Eugenio, 1990), which uses center- 
ing theory (Grosz et al, 1995) to account for the 
alternation of null and strong subjects. 
hi this paper, I build on and expand (Di Eu- 
genio, 1990) in several ways. First, I reanalyzc 
the hypotheses I proposed earlier with respect o 
a corl)uS of naturally occurring data} I show 
that those hypotheses are basically supported, 
iThe examples in (Di Euge.nio, 199{)) were 
constructed. 
and that when they aren't an elegant explmia- 
tion can be found by looking at a two member 
sequence of ce,ttering tra,tsitions rather than at 
just ()tie transition. Second, I extend my previous 
analysis by also discussing the centering functions 
of full NPs in subject position, and some occur- 
rences of pronotuis tuiaccounted for by centering. 
2 Centering theory 
Centering the.ory (Grosz et al, 1986; Brennan ct 
al., 1987; Grosz et al, 1995) models local coher- 
e.nee in discourse: it keet)s track of how local focus 
varies from one utterance to the next. (\]entering 
postulates that: ~ 
* Each utterance Un has associated with it a set 
of discourse ntities, the FOH.WAI{I)-LOO|<IN(~ CEN- 
TERS or Cfs. The Cf list is ranked according to 
discourse salience. 
- The I{ACKWARD-LOOKIN(\] CENTEI{~ or Cb~ ix the 
t 
member of the Cf list that lJ,~ most centrally con- 
cerns~ attd that links U~ to the previous discourse. 
* Finally, the PI%EFERI{.ED CENTEI{, or Cp: is the 
highest rauked member of the Of list. The Cp rep- 
resents a prediction about die Cb of the following 
utterance. 
Transitions between two adjacent utterances 
U,>_I and U,~ can be characterized asa function of 
looking backward whether Cb(Un) is the same 
as Cb(Un 1) - attd of looking forward whether 
Cb(Ur~) is the same as Cp(U,~). Table 1 illustrates 
the Pour transitions that are detined according to 
diese constraints. (Brennan et al, 1987) proposes 
a default ordering on transitions which correlates 
with discourse coherence: CONTINUE is preferred 
to RETAIN is prelbrred to SMOOTH-SHIFT is pre-

The saliency ordering on the Cf list, which is 
generally equated with grmnmatieal  function, for 
Wes(;ern language.s is SUBJE(,T > OILJI,;(',T2 > ()lb

analogous to empathy arises in Wesl,ern languages 
as well: e.g. with I)erception verbs, it is the expe- 
richter, which is ofl;en in ot)jec.t i)osition, rather 
than the grammal, ieal sut)jet't, thai, shouhl be 
r~mked higher. 
Finally, centering provides an interesting fraltlt~= 
work for studying the functions of pronouns, as 
tim ot)servation that the Ct) is ofl;e.ll de.leted or 
pronominal ized can be st&ted an the following rule: 
Ru le  1 / f  some element of CI(U,, ,) is realized 
as a pronoun in U~, then so is Cb(U,~). 
This rule has been (:omt)utationally int, erpreted 
to individuaix: the Cb. If U,~ has:

Centering theory has ;q)pealing traits from t)oth 
cognitive and comi)uLational points of view. From 
a cognitive t)erst)ec.tive, it explains certain ph(;- 
nOlilella of local discourse, eohe.reuce (e.g. prolloln- 
inal "garden l )aths') ,  and is supported by psy- 
cholinguisti(, e.xperiments (Gordon et al, 1993). 
Computational ly,  it is a simple mechanism, and 
thus it has been the basis for simple algoridm~s 
for anaphora resolution (Brennan el; al., 1987). 
Much work still remains to t)e done on (:en- 
tering. For examph;, most (tevelol)menl, so l\]u' 
has been based on simt)lc eonsLrucl;ed (;xamples:

how possessives and subordimtte clauses al'feet re.- 
ferring expression resolution lnust t)e addressed. 
This paper is a contribution in that dire.orion. 
3 The Italian pronominal system 
Ital ian has two pronominal  systems (CabJ)rese, 
1986): weak l)ronouns, th;tt iIlust always be c.liti- 
cized to the verb (e.g. Io, le, gli - respeetiw:ly him, 
accusative; them, feminine accusative or her, da- 
tive.; him, dative), and strong t)ronouns (\[ui, tei, 
353 
Ioro - respee.tively tie or hiln; she or her; they or 
them).4 The null subject is considered part of the 
system of weak pronouns. 
Weak and strong pronouns are often in comple- 
mentary distribution, as strong pronouns have to 
be used in prepositional phrases, e.g. per lui, for 
him. However, this syntactic alternation doesn't 
apl)ly in subject position. The choice of null ver- 
sits strong pronoun de.ponds on pragmatic factors; 
the centering explanation offered in (Di Eugenio, 
1990) goes as follows: 
(3a) Typically, a nltll subject signals a CONTINUE, 
&lid a strong pronotin a RE'FAIN or a SIIIFT. 
(3b) A null subject can be felicitously used in 
eases of RETAIN or SHIFT if in U,~ the syn- 
tactic context tip to and including the ver- 
bal form(s) carrying tense and / or agreement 
forces the null subject to refer to a particular 
referent and not to Cb(U,~ l)- 
The evidence for (3b) provided in (Di Eug(> 
nio, 1990) derived, among others, from modal and 
control verb constructions, in which clitics may 
be clitieized to the infinitival complement of the 
higher verb or may climb in front of the higher 
verb. Wheu the clitic climbs, certain pronomiual 
"garden path" effects, deriving from a wrong in- 
terpretation initially assigned to the null slibject 
and later retracted, are avoided.

4.1 The  corpus  
The corpus amounts to about 25 pages of text, 
and 12,000 words; it is composed of excerpts from 
two books (yon Arnim, 1989; Fallaci, 1989), a 
letter (Mila, 1993), a posting on the Italian bul- 
letin board (SCI, 1994), a short story (Nichetti, 
1993), and three articles from two newspapers (del 
Buono, 1993; Pagetti, 1993; La Nazione, 1994). 
The excerpts are of different lengths, with the ex- 
cerI)tS from the two books being the longest. 
Texts were chosen to cover a variety of contem- 
porary written Italian prose, from formal (news- 
paper articles about politics mid literature), to in- 
formal (posting on the Italian bulletin board), and 
according to the following criteria: a) ,ninimal di- 
rect speech, which has not been addressed iu cen- 
4kui, lei, Ioro are the oblique forms of the strong 
system, while the nonfinative \[brms are respectively 
egN, ella, essi/e: in current Italian the latter forms are 
rarely used as the oblique forms have replaced them in 
subject position in my corpus there are only four 
occurrences of these nominative forms, and they all 
occur ii~ the same article (Pagetti, 1993). 
tering yet; b) prose that describes ituations in- 
volving several animate refe, rents, bee, ause strong 
t)ronouns can refer only to animate referents. 
Table 2 shows the distrit)ution of animate third 
person subjects partitioned into: full NPs 
the numbers in parentheses refer to possessive 
NPs; strong pronouns; null subje(;ts I counted 
only those whose antecedents are not determined 
by contraindexing constraints (Chomsky, 1981).; 
other anaphors (e.g. tutte, allI~,,,) they won't 
be analyzed in this pat)er. 
4.2 Issues 
When applying (:entering to real text, one realizes 
that lnany issues have, llOt been solved yet. I will 
comment here on how deictics, possessives, and 
subordinate clauses affect centering. 
Deict ics  such its I, you, etc. The problem is 
whether they are part of the Cf list or not. I 
follow (Walker, 1993) in assuming that deictics 
are always available as part of global h)cus, and 
therefore are outside centering. 
Possess ives.  Table 3 includes a category 
marked possessive, which refers to hill NPs that 
inchtde a possessive adjective referring to an ani- 
mate entity, such as i suoi sforzi -his cfforts. 
The problem is how possessives affect Cb com- 
putation and Cf ordering. While Cb computation 
does not appear to be affected by a possessive, 
that behaves like a i)ronoun, the Cf ranking ueeds 
to be modified. An NP of type possessive refers 
to two entities, the possessor Po,. and the pos- 
sessed P~d. P~,d corresponds to the full NP, and 
thus its position in Cf is determined by the NP's 
grammatical flmction; as regards P,,., my working 
heuristics is to rank it as iinmediately preceding 
P~d if P~d is inanimate, as immediately following 
P~.~t if P~d is animate. Such heuristics appears to 
work, t)ut needs to be rigorously teste.d. 
Subord inates .  Another important issue, that 
has not been extensively addressed ye.t - but see 
(Kameyama, 1997; Snri and McCoy, 1993) is 
how to deal with complex sentences that include 
coordinates and subordinates. The questions that 
arise concern whether there are independent Cb's 
and Cf lists for every clause; if not, how the Cb 
of the complex sentence is computed, and how se- 
mantic entities appearing in different clauses are 
ordered on the global Cf list. 
In this paper, I will loosely adopt Kmneyama's 
proposal (1997) that sentences containing con- 
jtlncts and tensed adjuncts are broken down iiito a 
linear sequence of centering "units", while tense-

5 Conclus ions 
hi this paper, I examhled the referriug functions 
that diffe.rent types of subjects perform in Ital- 
ian within the centering framework. I built on 
the analysis presented in (Di Eugenio, 1990), and 
extended it in several directions: first, I used a 
corpus of really occurring examples; second, I in- 
eluded phenomena such as possessives and sub- 
ordinate clauses; third, I refined the notion of
