Abstract
We present discriminative reordering
models for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation. The models are trained
using the maximum entropy principle.
We use several types of features: based on
words, based on word classes, based on
the local context. We evaluate the overall
performance of the reordering models as
well as the contribution of the individual
feature types on a word-aligned corpus.
Additionally, we show improved transla-
tion performance using these reordering
models compared to a state-of-the-art
baseline system.
1 Introduction
In recent evaluations, phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation systems have achieved good per-
formance. Still the fluency of the machine transla-
tion output leaves much to desire. One reason is
that most phrase-based systems use a very simple re-
ordering model. Usually, the costs for phrase move-
ments are linear in the distance, e.g. see (Och et al,
1999; Koehn, 2004; Zens et al, 2005).
Recently, in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) and in
(Koehn et al, 2005), a reordering model has been
described that tries to predict the orientation of a
phrase, i.e. it answers the question ?should the next
phrase be to the left or to the right of the current
phrase?? This phrase orientation probability is con-
ditioned on the current source and target phrase and
relative frequencies are used to estimate the proba-
bilities.
We adopt the idea of predicting the orientation,
but we propose to use a maximum-entropy based
model. The relative-frequency based approach may
suffer from the data sparseness problem, because
most of the phrases occur only once in the training
corpus. Our approach circumvents this problem by
using a combination of phrase-level and word-level
features and by using word-classes or part-of-speech
information. Maximum entropy is a suitable frame-
work for combining these different features with a
well-defined training criterion.
In (Koehn et al, 2005) several variants of the ori-
entation model have been tried. It turned out that for
different tasks, different models show the best per-
formance. Here, we let the maximum entropy train-
ing decide which features are important and which
features can be neglected. We will see that addi-
tional features do not hurt performance and can be
safely added to the model.
The remaining part is structured as follows: first
we will describe the related work in Section 2 and
give a brief description of the baseline system in
Section 3. Then, we will present the discriminative
reordering model in Section 4. Afterwards, we will
evaluate the performance of this new model in Sec-
tion 5. This evaluation consists of two parts: first we
will evaluate the prediction capabilities of the model
on a word-aligned corpus and second we will show
improved translation quality compared to the base-
line system. Finally, we will conclude in Section 6.
2 Related Work
As already mentioned in Section 1, many current
phrase-based statistical machine translation systems
use a very simple reordering model: the costs
55
for phrase movements are linear in the distance.
This approach is also used in the publicly available
Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004). The idea of pre-
dicting the orientation is adopted from (Tillmann
and Zhang, 2005) and (Koehn et al, 2005). Here,
we use the maximum entropy principle to combine
a variety of different features.
A reordering model in the framework of weighted
finite state transducers is described in (Kumar and
Byrne, 2005). There, the movements are defined at
the phrase level, but the window for reordering is
very limited. The parameters are estimated using an
EM-style method.
None of these methods try to generalize from the
words or phrases by using word classes or part-of-
speech information.
The approach presented here has some resem-
blance to the bracketing transduction grammars
(BTG) of (Wu, 1997), which have been applied to
a phrase-based machine translation system in (Zens
et al, 2004). The difference is that, here, we do
not constrain the phrase reordering. Nevertheless
the inverted/monotone concatenation of phrases in
the BTG framework is similar to the left/right phrase
orientation used here.
3 Baseline System
In statistical machine translation, we are given a
source language sentence fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ ,
which is to be translated into a target language sen-
tence eI1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Among all possible tar-
get language sentences, we will choose the sentence
with the highest probability:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1|fJ1 )
} (1)
The posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) is modeled di-
rectly using a log-linear combination of several
models (Och and Ney, 2002):
Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) =
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
)
?
I?,e?I?1
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(e?I
?
1 , fJ1 )
)
(2)
The denominator represents a normalization factor
that depends only on the source sentence fJ1 . There-
fore, we can omit it during the search process. As a
decision rule, we obtain:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{ M
?
m=1
?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
}
(3)
This approach is a generalization of the source-
channel approach (Brown et al, 1990). It has the
advantage that additional models h(?) can be eas-
ily integrated into the overall system. The model
scaling factors ?M1 are trained with respect to the fi-
nal translation quality measured by an error criterion
(Och, 2003).
We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation
system (Zens and Ney, 2004; Zens et al, 2005) in-
cluding the following models: an n-gram language
model, a phrase translation model and a word-based
lexicon model. The latter two models are used for
both directions: p(f |e) and p(e|f). Additionally,
we use a word penalty and a phrase penalty. The
reordering model of the baseline system is distance-
based, i.e. it assigns costs based on the distance from
the end position of a phrase to the start position of
the next phrase. This very simple reordering model
is widely used, for instance in (Och et al, 1999;
Koehn, 2004; Zens et al, 2005).
4 The Reordering Model
4.1 Idea
In this section, we will describe the proposed dis-
criminative reordering model.
To make use of word level information, we need
the word alignment within the phrase pairs. This can
be easily stored during the extraction of the phrase
pairs from the bilingual training corpus. If there are
multiple possible alignments for a phrase pair, we
use the most frequent one.
The notation is introduced using the illustration in
Figure 1. There is an example of a left and a right
phrase orientation. We assume that we have already
produced the three-word phrase in the lower part.
Now, the model has to predict if the start position
of the next phrase j? is to the left or to the right of
the current phrase. The reordering model is applied
only at the phrase boundaries. We assume that the
reordering within the phrases is correct.
In the remaining part of this section, we will de-
scribe the details of this reordering model. The
classes our model predicts will be defined in Sec-
tion 4.2. Then, the feature functions will be defined

in Section 4.3. The training criterion and the train-
ing events of the maximum entropy model will be
described in Section 4.4.
4.2 Class Definition
Ideally, this model predicts the start position of the
next phrase. But as predicting the exact position is
rather difficult, we group the possible start positions
into classes. In the simplest case, we use only two
classes. One class for the positions to the left and
one class for the positions to the right. As a refine-
ment, we can use four classes instead of two: 1) one
position to the left, 2) more than one positions to the
left, 3) one position to the right, 4) more than one
positions to the right.
In general, we use a parameter D to specify 2 ? D
classes of the types:
? exactly d positions to the left, d = 1, ...,D ? 1
? at least D positions to the left
? exactly d positions to the right, d = 1, ...,D?1
? at least D positions to the right
Let cj,j? denote the orientation class for a move-
ment from source position j to source position j? as
illustrated in Figure 1. In the case of two orientation
classes, cj,j? is defined as:
cj,j? =
{
left, if j? < j
right, if j? > j (4)
Then, the reordering model has the form
p(cj,j?|fJ1 , eI1, i, j)
A well-founded framework for directly modeling the
probability p(cj,j?|fJ1 , eI1, i, j) is maximum entropy
(Berger et al, 1996). In this framework, we have a
set of N feature functions hn(fJ1 , eI1, i, j, cj,j?), n =
1, . . . ,N . Each feature function hn is weighted with
a factor ?n. The resulting model is:
p?N1 (cj,j?|f
J
1 , eI1, i, j)
=
exp
( N
?
n=1
?nhn(fJ1 , eI1, i, j, cj,j?)
)
?
c?
exp
( N
?
n=1
?nhn(fJ1 , eI1, i, j, c?)
) (5)
The functional form is identical to Equation 2,
but here we will use a large number of binary
features, whereas in Equation 2 usually only a
very small number of real-valued features is used.
More precisely, the resulting reordering model
p?N1 (cj,j?|f
J
1 , eI1, i, j) is used as an additional com-
ponent in the log-linear combination of Equation 2.
4.3 Feature Definition
The feature functions of the reordering model de-
pend on the last alignment link (j, i) of a phrase.
Note that the source position j is not necessarily the
57
end position of the source phrase. We use the source
position j which is aligned to the last word of the
target phrase in target position i. The illustration in
Figure 1 contains such an example.
To introduce generalization capabilities, some of
the features will depend on word classes or part-
of-speech information. Let F J1 denote the word
class sequence that corresponds to the source lan-
guage sentence fJ1 and let EI1 denote the target word
class sequence that corresponds to the target lan-
guage sentence eI1. Then, the feature functions are
of the form hn(fJ1 , eI1, F J1 , EI1 , i, j, j?). We consider
the following binary features:
1. source words within a window around the cur-
rent source position j
hf,d,c(fJ1 , eI1, F J1 , EI1 , i, j, j?) (6)
= ?(fj+d, f) ? ?(c, cj,j?)
2. target words within a window around the cur-
rent target position i
he,d,c(fJ1 , eI1, F J1 , EI1 , i, j, j?) (7)
= ?(ei+d, e) ? ?(c, cj,j?)
3. word classes or part-of-speech within a window
around the current source position j
hF,d,c(fJ1 , eI1, F J1 , EI1 , i, j, j?) (8)
= ?(Fj+d, F ) ? ?(c, cj,j?)
4. word classes or part-of-speech within a window
around the current target position i
hE,d,c(fJ1 , eI1, F J1 , EI1 , i, j, j?) (9)
= ?(Ei+d, E) ? ?(c, cj,j?)
Here, ?(?, ?) denotes the Kronecker-function. In the
experiments, we will use d ? {?1, 0, 1}. Many
other feature functions are imaginable, e.g. combi-
nations of the described feature functions, n-gram
or multi-word features, joint source and target lan-
guage feature functions.
4.4 Training
As training criterion, we use the maximum class
posterior probability. This corresponds to maximiz-
ing the likelihood of the maximum entropy model.
Since the optimization criterion is convex, there is
only a single optimum and no convergence problems
occur. To train the model parameters ?N1 , we use the
Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm (Dar-
roch and Ratcliff, 1972).
In practice, the training procedure tends to result
in an overfitted model. To avoid overfitting, (Chen
and Rosenfeld, 1999) have suggested a smoothing
method where a Gaussian prior distribution of the
parameters is assumed.
This method tried to avoid very large lambda val-
ues and prevents features that occur only once for a
specific class from getting a value of infinity.
We train IBM Model 4 with GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003) in both translation directions. Then the
alignments are symmetrized using a refined heuris-
tic as described in (Och and Ney, 2003). This word-
aligned bilingual corpus is used to train the reorder-
ing model parameters, i.e. the feature weights ?N1 .
Each alignment link defines an event for the max-
imum entropy training. An exception are the one-
to-many alignments, i.e. one source word is aligned
to multiple target words. In this case, only the top-
most alignment link is considered because the other
ones cannot occur at a phrase boundary. Many-to-
one and many-to-many alignments are handled in a
similar way.
5 Experimental Results
5.1 Statistics
The experiments were carried out on the Basic
Travel Expression Corpus (BTEC) task (Takezawa
et al, 2002). This is a multilingual speech cor-
pus which contains tourism-related sentences sim-
ilar to those that are found in phrase books. We
use the Arabic-English, the Chinese-English and the
Japanese-English data. The corpus statistics are
shown in Table 1.
As the BTEC is a rather clean corpus, the prepro-
cessing consisted mainly of tokenization, i.e., sep-
arating punctuation marks from words. Addition-
ally, we replaced contractions such as it?s or I?m in
the English corpus and we removed the case infor-
mation. For Arabic, we removed the diacritics and
we split common prefixes: Al, w, f, b, l. There
was no special preprocessing for the Chinese and the
Japanese training corpora.
To train and evaluate the reordering model, we

use the word aligned bilingual training corpus. For
evaluating the classification power of the reordering
model, we partition the corpus into a training part
and a test part. In our experiments, we use about
10% of the corpus for testing and the remaining
part for training the feature weights of the reorder-
ing model with the GIS algorithm using YASMET
(Och, 2001). The statistics of the training and test
alignment links is shown in Table 2. The number
of training events ranges from 119K for Japanese-
English to 144K for Arabic-English.
The word classes for the class-based features are
trained using the mkcls tool (Och, 1999). In the
experiments, we use 50 word classes. Alternatively,
one could use part-of-speech information for this
purpose.
Additional experiments were carried out on the
large data track of the Chinese-English NIST task.
The corpus statistics of the bilingual training cor-
pus are shown in Table 3. The language model was
trained on the English part of the bilingual train-
ing corpus and additional monolingual English data
from the GigaWord corpus. The total amount of lan-
guage model training data was about 600M running
words. We use a fourgram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing as implemented in
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). For the four En-
glish reference translations of the evaluation sets, the
accumulated statistics are presented.

5.2 Classification Results
In this section, we present the classification results
for the three language pairs. In Table 4, we present
the classification results for two orientation classes.
As baseline we always choose the most frequent
orientation class. For Arabic-English, the baseline
is with 6.3% already very low. This means that the
word order in Arabic is very similar to the word or-
der in English. For Chinese-English, the baseline
is with 12.7% about twice as large. The most dif-
ferences in word order occur for Japanese-English.
This seems to be reasonable as Japanese has usu-
ally a different sentence structure, subject-object-
verb compared to subject-verb-object in English.
For each language pair, we present results for sev-
eral combination of features. The three columns per
language pair indicate if the features are based on the
words (column label ?Words?), on the word classes
(column label ?Classes?) or on both (column label

?W+C?). We also distinguish if the features depend
on the target sentence (?Tgt?), on the source sentence
(?Src?) or on both (?Src+Tgt?).
For Arabic-English, using features based only on
words of the target sentence the classification er-
ror rate can be reduced to 4.5%. If the features are
based only on the source sentence words, a classifi-
cation error rate of 2.9% is reached. Combining the
features based on source and target sentence words,
a classification error rate of 2.8% can be achieved.
Adding the features based on word classes, the clas-
sification error rate can be further improved to 2.1%.
For the other language pairs, the results are similar
except that the absolute values of the classification
error rates are higher.
We observe the following:
? The features based on the source sentence per-
form better than features based on the target
sentence.
? Combining source and target sentence features
performs best.
? Increasing the window always helps, i.e. addi-
tional context information is useful.
? Often the word-class based features outperform
the word-based features.
? Combining word-based and word-class based
features performs best.
? In general, adding features does not hurt the
performance.
These are desirable properties of an appropriate
reordering model. The main point is that these are
fulfilled not only on the training data, but on unseen
test data. There seems to be no overfitting problem.
In Table 5, we present the results for four orien-
tation classes. The final error rates are a factor 2-4
larger than for two orientation classes. Despite that
we observe the same tendencies as for two orien-
tation classes. Again, using more features always
helps to improve the performance.
5.3 Translation Results
For the translation experiments on the BTEC task,
we report the two accuracy measures BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) as
well as the two error rates: word error rate (WER)
and position-independent word error rate (PER).
These criteria are computed with respect to 16 refer-
ences.
In Table 6, we show the translation results for
the BTEC task. In these experiments, the reorder-
ing model uses two orientation classes, i.e. it pre-
dicts either a left or a right orientation. The fea-
tures for the maximum-entropy based reordering
model are based on the source and target language
words within a window of one. The word-class
based features are not used for the translation ex-
periments. The maximum-entropy based reordering
model achieves small but consistent improvement
for all the evaluation criteria. Note that the baseline
system, i.e. using the distance-based reordering, was
among the best systems in the IWSLT 2005 evalua-

tion campaign (Eck and Hori, 2005).
Some translation examples are presented in Ta-
ble 7. We observe that the system using the
maximum-entropy based reordering model produces
more fluent translations.
Additional translation experiments were carried
out on the large data track of the Chinese-English
NIST task. For this task, we use only the BLEU
and NIST scores. Both scores are computed case-
insensitive with respect to four reference translations
using the mteval-v11b tool1.
For the NIST task, we use the BLEU score as pri-
mary criterion which is optimized on the NIST 2002
evaluation set using the Downhill Simplex algorithm
(Press et al, 2002). Note that only the eight or nine
model scaling factors of Equation 2 are optimized
using the Downhill Simplex algorithm. The feature
weights of the reordering model are trained using
the GIS algorithm as described in Section 4.4. We
use a state-of-the-art baseline system which would
have obtained a good rank in the last NIST evalua-
1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/resources/scoring.htm
tion (NIST, 2005).
The translation results for the NIST task are pre-
sented in Table 8. We observe consistent improve-
ments of the BLEU score on all evaluation sets. The
overall improvement due to reordering ranges from
1.2% to 2.0% absolute. The contribution of the
maximum-entropy based reordering model to this
improvement is in the range of 25% to 58%, e.g. for
the NIST 2003 evaluation set about 58% of the im-
provement using reordering can be attributed to the
maximum-entropy based reordering model.
We also measured the classification performance
for the NIST task. The general tendencies are iden-
tical to the BTEC task.
6 Conclusions
We have presented a novel discriminative reorder-
ing model for statistical machine translation. This
model is trained on the word aligned bilingual cor-
pus using the maximum entropy principle. Several
types of features have been used:

ordering model on a held-out word-aligned corpus.
We have shown that the model is able to predict the
orientation very well, e.g. for Arabic-English the
classification error rate is only 2.1%.
We presented improved translation results for
three language pairs on the BTEC task and for the
large data track of the Chinese-English NIST task.
In none of the cases additional features have hurt
the classification performance on the held-out test
corpus. This is a strong evidence that the maximum
entropy framework is suitable for this task.
Another advantage of our approach is the gener-
alization capability via the use of word classes or
part-of-speech information. Furthermore, additional
features can be easily integrated into the maximum
entropy framework.
So far, the word classes were not used for the
translation experiments. As the word classes help
for the classification task, we might expect further
improvements of the translation results. Using part-
of-speech information instead (or in addition) to the
automatically computed word classes might also be
beneficial. More fine-tuning of the reordering model
toward translation quality might also result in im-
provements. As already mentioned in Section 4.3, a
richer feature set could be helpful.
