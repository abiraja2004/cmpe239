Abstract. The ROMVOX Text-toaSpeech synthesis ystem developed by our team is the first one that 
allowed the synthesis of any unrestricted Romanian text with intonation facilities on 1BM-PC compatible 
computers. During the last years of research several version of text-to-speech systems were achieved, 
trying to enhance their facilities. Our paper describes the present stage of our experiments performed in
order to improve the naturalness of the generated voice. 
1. Introduction 
Speech synthesis ystems are expected to play important roles in advanced user-friendly human-machine 
interfaces. Wishing to realize an as good as possible text-to-speech system for the Romanian language the 
research started with the ?development of the software for monotonous peech synthesis, which simply 
concatenated the elements of the speech database. Prosodic aspects need to impose a correspondent 
modification of the synthesized speech signal, modification performed in the second version based on 
LPC. The experimental results using the classical LPC synthesis method proved that the quality of the 
synthesized signal is limited and it cannot be considerably improved by rising the prediction order, the 
sampling frequency or the parameters' refreshing frequency. The following chapters present the language 
specific aspects of the ROMVOX system and our last approach regarding the used synthesis technique. 
2. The Building Elements of the??ROMVOX Text-to-Speech System 
2.1 Text-preprocessing. We need a text-preprocessing module on the grapheme level in order to convert 
the incoming orthography into some linguistically reasonable s~andard forms. There are many phenomena 
encountered in normal orthography like: underlining, the occurrence of capitals, abbreviation containing 
periods, abbreviations containing no vowels, numbers, fractions, Roman numerals, dates, times, formulas 
and a wide variety, of  punctuation i cluding periods, commas, question marks, parentheses, quotation marks 
and hyphens. In our system the abbreviations are stored in a vocabulary, which can be extended by the user, 
so field specific abbreviation can be built into the system. 
2.2 Speech sound set. We used a set of 31 phonemes for Romanian language. As internal representation for
special Romanian sounds we used the following symbols: gl (in ge, gi), g (in ghe, ghi), c (in ce,ei), k (in 
the, ehi),al (for Romanian letter ~), il (for7 and $) sl (for ~), tl (for t). 
2.3 Conversion of graphemes. In our system the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules are alphabetized 
according to the first letter of the sequence. Each letter of the alphabet represents a separate rule block in the

table. One such block has the longest rule at the top and the shortest rule at the bottom; i.el the last rule 
consists of only one letter. 
Examples: 
The e sound rule block the e sound block rule As result of the grapheme-to:phoneme conversion 
eslti=_jlesltjl._ coop=ko_op  algorithm, the desired string of diphones is 
este=_jleste_ cea=ca obtained. For example, the string corresponding to 
exa=egza eio=co the word 'floare' is: _ffl 1o oa ar re e_. 
eio=ej lo chi=ki . 
ca= jla_. che=ke In future versions of ROMVOX, a second level 
el=__yjlel_ ci=ci processing of sound codes will be experimented. 
ei=ej 1_ ce=ce So, timing modifications could be made according 
e=e c=k to the rules of the prosody preparation module. 
Where _ means pause, j I means pecial short i. 
2.4 Word accent. For Romanian language the word accent is free, choosing between the last two syllables 
of the word, and there are many words with other place of accent. Semantically different words have the 
same orthography. For example: 
cfirele (cure -plural) currle (belt -plural) 
vrsel~ (gay -feminine, plural) vesrl~ (dishes) 
We are thinking of the possibility to formalize these kinds of problems. 
2.5 Intonation. For obtaining acceptable intonation for unrestricted texts, a set of rules has to be formulated 
which produces natural sounding pitch contours for utterances that may have never been spoken. 
In sentence intonation, one serious problem is to find such rules that make the monotonous speech more 
natural, so that listening to long texts would not be uncomfortable. We studied experimentally the pitch 
contour for different kinds of sentences (declaratives, questions, and exclamations). For declarative 
sentences, the fundamental fi-equency raises for the first word (from 100% to 140% of its value and slows 
down to 125% for the last part of this word), and slows down until the end of the sentence, xcept he last 
word: Here it falls at 70% and remains Constant. 
Questions can be with Q-word (specific word for interrogation) orwithout. For the former, the fundamental 
frequency raises on this word from 100% to 160% and comes down to 100%. For the last type of questions 
we adopted aconventional pitch contour, but very subtle intonation effects cannot be handled. 
3. Signal processing 
Our last experiments in order to improve the quality of the synthesized signal are based on a hybrid 
timedomain-LPC approach. This approach takes into consideration the behavior of the glottal pulse (for 
voiced sounds) which can be described using the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model, \[Veldhuis 96\]. 
Figure 1.a. presents the time domain waveforms of the Romanian vowel o, the corespondent source signal 
(Figure 1.b.). As it can be seen, during the opened phase of the glottis in which the source signal contains 
values which are different from zero (also positive and negative values), the source signal assures the 
excitation of the filter, resulting a generated waveform which depends on the resonance characteristics of 
305 
Figure 1. Waveforms of the Romanian vowel 
o, uttered by a male (3 pitch periods) 
the vocal tract. During the closed phase of the glottis (no 
pressure wave) the vocal tract respectively the filter 
doesn't get energy anymore, so the generated waveform 
results in this phase as combination of damped oscillations. 
If the source signal would consist of a single opened phase 
of the glottis followed by a long closed phase, the 
generated waveform would be damped, ending with no 
oscillations. Because in reality the next opened phase 
follows immediately after a relatively short previous closed 
phase, the generated waveform will contain the effects of 
both the effects of the previous tate and the effect of the 
new excitation. Taking into account that the above model 
is a linear model, the two effects are combined by simple 
addition, in concordance with the theorem of 
superposition. This is equivalent to considering that the 
source signal consists of a few individual signals 
(waveforms c, d, and e) corresponding each to an 
individual opened-closed phase of the glottis, and each 
such individual source Signal will excite the filter resulting 
also individual output signals (waveforms f, g ,  and h). 
From the superposition of these output signals results the 
initial, whole output signal. The waveforms presented in 
Figure I. present such a case for three pitch periods. 
Pitch modification means the modification of the distances 
between two consecutive opened-closed cycles, in which 
the effect of the previous cycle will be combined with the effect of the new excitation in a different 
manner but exactly in concordance with the theorem of superposition. This means that it is necessary (in a 
previous analysis phase) to decompose the original signal in pitch-synchronous individual signals as those 
presented in Figure 1., signals f, g, h. In the synthesis phase we have only to superimpose this individual 
signalsat new distances in concordance with the desired new pitch. 
Figure 2. Waveform of vowel o, re-synthesized with 
modified pitch 
Figure 2. presents uch a case in which one 
individual pitch-synchronous signal is used to 
generate a longer output signal with modified 
pitch. The signal starts with a lower fundamental 
frequency (one octave lower), which increases to 
the initial value of the pitch (at the middle of the 
signal), continuing to increase to higher values 
(one octave higher). 
The main problem is the decomposition f the initial signal into individual, pith-synchronous signalS. 
This implies two aspects. First of all it is necessary todetermine the evolution of damped regime for each 
individual signal. As presented before this damped signal is due to the accumulated energy in the filter, 
and is determined by the resonance characteristics of the filter. We used the LPC analysis method, which 
is one of the most used methods for the determination f the filter characteristics of the vocal tract. If the 
parameters of the filter are determined and if the filter is placed in the initial state from the beginning of 
the closed phase of the glottis, it will generate automatically the desired amped signal which can last

over 2-3 other pitch periods. The other task is to eliminate the effect of this new determined damped 
signal upon the next pitch-synchronous individual signal (signals). This can be done by simply 
subtracting the current determined individual signal from the initial one. 
These two operations will be performed consecutively for the whole signal, and each intermediate 
individual signal is saved in a database (sound inventory). Because the sound inventory contains 
diphones, the above procedure must be applied for each diphone. 
4. Conclusions 
? As  ~resented before, the aim of our research was to develop an improved synthesis technique that should 
assure a better quality of the generated signal. The improvement concerns the signal processing part and it 
presents the following aspects and advantages with respect to our previous developments, respectively to
other synthesis techniques. 
The TD-PSOLA (Time Domain Pitch Synchronous Overlap-add) developed by CNET is a very simple 
but ingenious method which assures high voice quality, the only disadvantage is that it is based on a time: 
domain windowing technique which can introduce some spectral distortions during the pitch 
modification. The result of these spectrum distortions can be interpreted as a reverberation f the desired 
pitch-modified signal. TD-PSOLA requires at the same time a very exact pitch synchronous framing; any

of this reverberation effect. The first disadvantage 
was solved by CNET through adopting the LP- 
PSOLA technique. 
Our approach doesn't use any windowing 
technique, so this source of spectral distortion is 
eliminated. Figure 3. presents the spectral 
behavior o f  a generated signal with k=0.66

fundamental frequency)respectively with k=l.5 
(increasing fundamental frequency), both cases in 
comparison with the spectrum of the initial 
signal. As both figures show, the peaks of the 
modified harmonics are situated almost on the 
ideal imaginary spectrum envelope.
