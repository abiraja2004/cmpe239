Semantic disambiguation depends on a process of 
defining the appropriate knowledge context. Recent 
research directions suggest a eonnectionist approach 
which use dictionaries, but there remain problems of 
scale, analysis, and interpretation. IIere we focus on 
word disambiguation as scene selection, based on the 
Oxford Pictorial English Dictionary. We present a re- 
sults of a spatial-scene identification ability using our 
original associative mcmor~j, We show both theoretical 
and experimental nalysis, based on a several different 
measures including information entropy. 
1 In t roduct ion  
'the difficulty of semantic disambiguation in natural 
language processing originates with the complexity of 
defining disambiguating knowledge contexts (Barwise 
J. and Perry J., 1983). These knowledge contexts 
must provide unique interpretations for co-dependent 
words, and help resolve "semantic garden path" se- 
quences. For example, in "John shot some bucks,"a 
unique reading requires emantic agreement on "shot" 
and "bucks," suggesting either a hunting or gambling 
context. The semantic garden path can be illustrated 
by prefixing the above sentence with "John travelled to 
the woods," which might suggest he hunting context, 
but then appending "The illegal csmino was hidden far 
from town," to dramatically change the interpretation 
suggested by the first two sentences. 
The core of the problem is the disciplined and dy- 
namic construction of a disambiguating kvowledge 
context. While it might be possible to write static 
rules which provide disambiguating i formation i the 
context of complete knowledge, such rulmhased mod- 
els are both time and space inefficient. 
Recognizing these problems, Waltz D.L. and Pollack 
J.B.(1985) and Cottrell G.W.(1989) proposed a f,~sci- 
hating connectionist approach, which uses early ideas 
from semantic networks to resolve semantic ambiguity 
*Supported by the Fellowships ofthe Japan Society for the 
Promotion ofScience for Japanese Junior Scientists 
by dynamic spreading activation. This spreading acti- 
wttion construction of disambiguating context is based 
oil a high density associative cognitive model, but 
still has problems: (1) no automated learning method 
to adaptively construct he model, (2) non-scalable, 
and (3) no method of confirming hypothesized is- 
ambiguation. Shastri L.(1988) proposes a similar 
structure, which uses st statistical semantic network. 
Sharkey N.E. (1989) has proposed asystem for process- 
ing script-based narratives based on combining local 
representation a d relaxation techniques with ImrMlel 
distributed learning and mapping mechanisms. Mi- 
ikkulainen's system DISCERN(Miikkulainen R., 1993) 
is also suggestive ofadaptive processing, and uses self- 
organizing representation f words and memory de- 
pending on semantics. However, all of these models 
share the problems enumerated above. 
Research directions for improvements suggest the 
use of existing collections of machine-readM~le dictio- 
naries. Ilecently, Nishlklmi M. et al (1992) has pro- 
posed a new relationship between language acquistion 
and learning based on scene analaysis. Furthermore, 
Bookman L.A.(1993) has proposed a scalable architec- 
ture for integrating ~tqsociative and semantic memory 
using a thesaurus. Based on this idea of using existing 
sources of word meanings, Veronis and Ide (Veronis .1. 
and Ide N.M., 1990; Ide N.M. and Veronis J., 1993) use 
sew~ral dictionaries and to improve the ratio of words 
disambiguated to ambiguous words. 
In addition to ideas for the source of disambiguat- 
ing knowledge, many researchers have incorporated 
some kind of preference heuristics for improving tl,e 
efficiency of determining disambiguating constraints. 
Although these methods are essential for semantic pro- 
cessing they lack any coherent method for (1) evaluat- 
ing performance, and (2) acquiring new disaml)iguat- 
ing knowledge from real-world sensors. 
Of course all of these l)roblems result from the com- 
plexity of defining appropriate disambiguating knowl- 
edge contexts. To help control and reduce this com- 
plexity, Kohonen T.(1984) has suggested the cla.ssifica- 
tion of dlsambiguating i formation i to flmr types: (1) 
spatial contact, (2) tenqmral contact, (3) similarity, 
(4) contrast. Kohonen also emphmsizes the existence 
310 
of a contextual background in which primary percep- 
tions occur, but we clMm that this kind of information 
<:an be expressed in the existing four types. 
The previous approaches noted above can all be 
interpreted as using a complex mixture of the infor- 
mation types proposed by Kohonen. This coml>lex- 
ity makes it very difficult to identify or create a sta- 
ble mo<lel of learning the appropriate <lisan,biguating 
knowledge from the real world. 
Our original contribution here is to propose a lmsie 
method of word disambiguation b~med on spatial scene 
identification, and to provide a detaile<l analysis of its 
performance. The disambiguating knowledge is repre- 
sented in the form of a stochastic ~msociative memory, 
constructed fi-om the ()xford Pictorial English Dicti<>- 
nary (OPED). This l>ietorial dictionary claims to l>ro: 
vide word sense meanings for most ordinary lift.' scenes. 
The process of disambiguation is modelled as <leter- 
mining a unique mapping fi'om ambiguous input wor<ls 
to a particular l>ietorial <lictionary scene as modelle<l in 
the ~msociative menmry. The simple representatiml of 
pietorial knowledge. I)~med (m the OPED makes analy- 
sis simpler, and provides a potentially smooth (:onnee- 
tion to visual sensory data. 
2 Scene  Ident i f i ca t ion  
In order to identify spatial scenes lmsed on inl)ut sen- 
tenees, some kind of information <>f detining each seell(~ 
must exist. As exph'dned in the OPEl),  "The dictio- 
nary is edited regarding the depiction of (weryday ob- 
jects and situations, in order to allow greater scope 
for the treatment of these, objects and situatiovs in 
the context of English-speaking countries" \[from l;'of 
ward in OPED\]. Each scene or pictorial entry i~, the 
OPED accompanied by a word list of entries f,'om the 
scene (see next section). This bu,ldle of infi)rmation is 
the basis for organizing our associate memory model. 
2.1 Constra ints  
Here we ~msume some constraints on the method of 
representing and using the OPED scenes: 
? Only ordinal livivg scenes (384 scenes in(:lu(ling 
thousands of subseenes) are handled. All scenes 
are hypothesized to be eonstructable by combina- 
tions of these scenes. 
? Most of the words in OPEl) are noun terms ae- 
eoml)anied by adjective terms. In this system, 
spatial-seenes are identified by using only these 
words. No syntactical information is used. 
? Compound words are dec<)mposed into primitiw'. 
words. 
? The associative memory luus the ability to incre- 
mentally learn, but our analysis here uses a tixed 
set of scenes and words.

2.2 PDAI&CD and WAVE 
The spatial scene identification system analyzed in this 
paper is one moduh' of a general infi'rence architec- 
ture called l 'aralM l)istributed Associatiw." Inference 
and Contradiction /)etection (PDAI&CD)(Tsunoda 
'\['. and 'Fanak;t l\[., 1993), which uses an :msociatiw~. 
memory WAVE('\['sunoda T. an(\[ Tanaka H.) lmsed on 
neural networks and a logical veritieation system. We 
haw~ previously presented itll application of that archi- 
tecture to semantic ?lisambiguation (Tsunoda T. and 
Tanalat II., 1993). It features a eognitive model of fast 
disambiguation depending on context with bottom-up 
associatiw:, memory together with a nmre precise top- 
(lown feedba(:k process (Fig.l). After one scene is se- 
lected by previously inlmt words, the system can dis- 
ambiguate meaning of following words (as in the right 
side of Fig.2). In the. future, we plan to combine natu- 
ral language proce.ssing with visual image from sensory 
data. Our representation f the spatial data fi'om the 
OPED is considered to be a simplest approximation of
such visual sensory images.

2.3 Semantic Disambiguation 
Words in OPED have ditferent meanings correspond- 
ing to their use in ditferent scenes. When a set of am- 
biguous words uniquely determines a scene, we con- 
clude that the words have been successfully disam- 
biguated. We acknowledge that many other processes 
may be involved in general word sense disambiguation, 
but use this scene-selection sense of word sense (lisain- 
biguation from here on.  
We illustrate typical two examples below. The sys- 
tem with OPED and our associative memory can re(:- 
ognize these sentences and classify into each scene in 
the dictionary. Once a scene is identified, it assigns 
each ambiguous words uniquely. We call it semantical 
disambiguation of words here. The correspondances of 
the sentences and each meaning of word is summarized 
in Table.1.

Our system is able to disambiguate each meaning in 
these examples actually.

OPP;I) has originally a hierachlcal structure of catego 
rization (as in the left side of Fig.2), but we use the 
middle level of it (shaded part in the figure), which is 
most easily interl)retal~h!. 
To llrovide the associative memory model for l)ro - 
cessing words and selecting scenes, we, encode the 
OPED entries in tile WAVE model ms depicted in 
Fig.3. The weights between scene elements are au- 
tomatically learned during tile constructiou of the as- 
sociative memory. 
3.2  S impl i f ied  Mode l  o f  Assoc ia t ive  
Memory  WAVE 
The aim of using m~sociative memory for identifica- 
tion is to select tile most likely scene based on incom- 
plete word data from sentences. Ii and Ci are set to 
be elements of input space SI, scene space So:, respec- 
tively, in an ideal state, the approl)riate scene Ci is 
312 
mfiquely indexed by z~ssociation from a complete input 
vector: Ii A Ci. 
In the typical situation, however, the complete index 
is not provided and we require a way of ranking cam- 
peting scenes by defining a weighted activation value 
which depends on the i)artial inlmt, or set of ambigu- 
ous words, as follows: 
Ci = f (EWi f l J )  (1) 
J 
1 
f (x )  - (2) 1 + e-~'

where the weight of each compone.nt is given bythe  
conditional probability value 
W~j - P (C i l6  ) (4) 
A maximum-likelihoad scene is selected by a winner- 
take-all network: 
c .  = . , f i l ed  (5) 
This type of assaeiative meinory has following fea- 
tttres: 
? Unlike correlative models (Amari S. and Maginu 
K., 1988), neither distortion of pattern nor pseudo 
local minimum solutions arise from memorizing 
other patterns. 
? Memory capacity is O(mn) compared to O(n "2) 
of correlative Inodel, where m is average immber 
of wards per scene, and n is the total number af 
possible words. 
? Unlike back-propagation learning algorithms, in- 
cremental earning is l)ossilflc at any time in 
WAVE. 
3.3  Reca l l ing  pro l )ab i l i ty  and  es t ima-  
t ion  of required quant i ty  of in fo f  
mat ion  
Tile me`asure of scene selectivity is reduced to tile con- 
dition whether given words are unique to the SCelle. If 
all input words are cOlnlnon to l)lura\] scenes, they can 
not determine the original scene uniquely. For exam- 
pie, tile system can not determine whether to choose 
category CA ar CB only by seeing element q}' in Fig.4. 
If 'a' or tile set {a, b} is given, it is able ta select CA. 
Here we estimate the selectivity by the ratio of suc- 
cessfld cases to all of possible cases ,as follaws(n is the 
mlml}er of total elements, k is the number of elements 
related to each scene, aim m is the total number of 
scenes; incomplete information is dellned as a partial 
vector of elements number s (0 < s < k)). 
Tile pral)ability that s elements are shared si,nulta- 
neously by two patterns is 
kCs-t n-kCk.-.s-1 v(,, ,  k, ~) = (~) 
n Ck 
Ta extend this probal)ility to generalized cases of 
m patterns, we use the munber s of elements of the 
(1)artial) input vector. It can be estimated by counting 
the negative ase where illore thall one pattern shares 
elelllents.

3.4  Infornmtion Entropy 
As an alternative method of ewduation of spatial- 
see.he information of aPED,  we consider here self- 
information entropy and mntual-informatian e tropy 
along with the information theory of Shannon 
C.E.(19,t8).  
* Se l f - ln fo rmat ion  ent ropy :  
Fig.5 illustrates a talking scene. Although 
sentences involving many ambiguous wards are 
handed fr<>m the speaker to the listener, the lis- 
tener can disambiguate them with some kind of 
knowkedge common to these people. Conversely, 
the listner can determine scene 1)y the hande<l sen- 
tences. The entropy of scene selection ainbiguity 
is reduced by the interaction. We can define a con- 
cept of self-infarmation (SI) af the spatial-scene 
idetification module as the entropy of ainbiguous 
words or scenes. Assuming equal probalfility to 
the scene selection with no harmed ward, the en-

cualted.

Mutual-information e tropy (MIE) can lye defined 
as the contribution of additional words to identify 
a scene, and consequently, tile selectiveness of the 
target word or scene. In order to select a word 
meauing or scene fi'om the possible space Y, the 
space C of M1 other words are considered in the 
calculation of conditional entropy (CE). Mutual- 
information entrot>y per word is calculated by fol- 
lowing formula: 
MIE(O;O') = CU(C l O ) -CE(C IO '  ) 
Here, 0 is a set of previous tate parameters, and 
0 ~ is that of next one. Mutual-inforamtion can lye 
interpreted ,as the reduction from a previous con- 
ditional entropy to corresponding updated con- 
ditional entrolyy with additional words. We l)ro - 
vide a theoretical estimation of sclf-informatio,l 
of spatial-scenes with the dictionary in Table 2. 
Tile result suggests that it has the spa.tial-scene 
identification ability with a few words 1)rese,'va - 
tion. It also supl)orts the consequence of a h)gical- 
summation algorithm shown in next section.

Here we propose analyses of OPED and results of theo- 
retical simulations. As formula (9) is expensive(11711!

? Fig.6 (b) shows a distribution of number of scenes 
which are related to one element. The region 
where more than 100 scenes are related to one 
word are those for trivial words like 'a', 'the', 'of', 
'that',  'to', 'in', ~and', ~for', 'with', 's'. Although 
we could ignore these words for an actual appli- 
cation, we use them for fairness.

words of scenes arc input to the mssoeiative men> 
cry is illustrated in Fig.7. The recall rate in- 
cre`ases `as the input vector (set of words) becmnes 
more similar to c:omplete vector (set of words) pat- 
tern. Only about tlve words are enough to iden- 
tify each scene at recognition rate of 90 percent. 
Compared to the average, number of 184 words 
ill each scene, this required mlmber is sufficiently 
small. It proves good performance of the ` associa- 
tive memory used in this module. 'l~heoretical re-

evaluation, we can get a solution with maximum- 
likelihood slttisfying constraints automatically.

5 Summary 
We analyzed the selectivity of our 384 living scenes 
with many sets of words which are part of 11,711 words 
used in the dictionary OPED. The average munber of 
words in one scene is about 184. The probability of re- 
calling correct scenes with input partial words is difl'er- 
ent from the theoretical simulation of random assign- 
ment constructed with vMues of these parameters. Un- 
like random generation of arbitrary symbols, seman- 
tics of natural anguage consists of highly-correlated 
meanings of words. Although the theoretical simula- 
tion of the simplified model suggests a rough estima- 
tion of disambiguation requirements weshould analyze 
the dictionary itself as in this paper. 
Another suggestive analysis is using Shannon's in- 
formation or entropy, which gives us more accurate. 
information depending on prol)ability of each phe- 
nomenon. It shows how to estimate the amount of 
semantic ambiguity. 
Spatial-scene identification is one of the simplest 
kind of context necessary to disambiguate meaning of 
words an(\[ offer a new method for future integration of
natural language processing and visual pattern recog- 
nition.
