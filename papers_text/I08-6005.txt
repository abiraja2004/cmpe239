Abstract
Accurate high-coverage translation is a vi-
tal component of reliable cross language in-
formation access (CLIA) systems. While
machine translation (MT) has been shown
to be effective for CLIA tasks in previous
evaluation workshops, it is not well suited
to specialized tasks where domain specific
translations are required. We demonstrate
that effective query translation for CLIA can
be achieved in the domain of cultural her-
itage (CH). This is performed by augment-
ing a standard MT system with domain-
specific phrase dictionaries automatically
mined from the online Wikipedia. Exper-
iments using our hybrid translation system
with sample query logs from users of CH
websites demonstrate a large improvement
in the accuracy of domain specific phrase de-
tection and translation.
1 Introduction
Reliable translation is a key component of effective
Cross Language Information Access (CLIA) sys-
tems. Various approaches to translation have been
explored at evaluation workshops such as TREC1,
CLEF2 and NTCIR3. Experiments at these work-
shops have been based on laboratory collections
consisting of news articles or technical reports with
?TREC? style queries with a minimum length of a

full sentence. Test collection design at these work-
shops often ensures that there are a reasonable num-
ber of relevant documents available for each query.
In such cases general purpose translation resources
based on bilingual dictionaries and standard ma-
chine translation (MT) have been shown to be ef-
fective for translation in CLIA. However, this is less
likely to be the case when translating the very short
queries typically entered by general users of search
engines, particularly when they are seeking informa-
tion in a specific domain.
Online cultural heritage (CH) content is currently
appearing in many countries produced by organisa-
tions such as national libraries, museums, galleries
and audiovisual archives. Additionally, there are in-
creasing amounts of CH relevant content available
more generally on the World Wide Web. While
some of this material concerns national or regional
content only of local interest, much material relates
to items involving multiple nations and languages,
for example concerning events or groups encom-
passing large areas of Europe or Asia. In order to
gain a full understanding of such things, including
details contained in different collections and explor-
ing different cultural perspectives, often requires ef-
fective multilingual search technologies.
CH content encompasses various different media,
including of course text documents, but also im-
ages, videos, and audio recordings which may only
be described by very limited metadata labels. Such
metadata may include simple factual details such as
date of creation, but also descriptive details relat-
ing to the contents of the item and interpretation
and contextualization of the content. Multilingual
searching using metadata content requires that ei-
ther the metadata be translated into a language with
which the user is able to search or that the search
query be translated into the language of the meta-
data. This alternative of document or query trans-
lation is a well rehearsed argument in CLIA, which
has generally concerned itself with full text docu-
ment searching. However, the features of metadata
require a more careful analysis. Metadata is typi-
cally dense in search terms, while lacking the lin-
guistic structure and information redundancy of full
text documents. The absence of linguistic struc-
ture makes precise translation of content problem-
atic, while the lack of redundancy means that accu-
rate translation of individual words and phrases be-
tween the query and document is vital to minimize
mismatch between query and document terms. De-
veloping reliable and robust approaches to transla-
tion for metadata search is thus an important com-
ponent of search for many CH archives.
The EU FP6 MultiMatch4 project is concerned
with information access for multimedia and multi-
lingual content for a range of European languages.
In this paper we report on the MultiMatch query
translation methods we are developing to deal with
domain-specific language in the CH domain. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques
using example query logs from CH sites in English,
Spanish and Italian. We translate the queries and ex-
amine the quality of these translations using human
annotation. We show how a domain-specific phrase
dictionary can be used to augment traditional gen-
eral MT systems to improve the coverage and relia-
bility of translation of these queries. We also show
how retrieval performance on CH image metadata is
improved with the use of these improved, domain-
specific translations.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 introduces the translation resources
used for this study, Section 3 describes our experi-
mental setup and results, Section 4 summarizes our
conclusions, and Section 5 gives details of our on-
going work.

2 Query Translation Techniques
The MT approach to query translation for CLIA
uses an existing MT system to provide automatic
translation. Using MT systems for query transla-
tion is widely used in CLIA when such a system
is available for the particular language pair under
consideration. Results reported at the standard re-
trieval evaluation workshops have often shown it
to be competitive with other translation methods.
However, while MT systems can provide reasonable
translations for general language expressions, they
are often not sufficient for domain-specific phrases
that contain personal names, place names, techni-
cal terms, titles of artworks, etc. In addition, cer-
tain words and phrases hold special meanings in a
specific domain. For example, the Spanish phrase
?Canto general? is translated into English as ?gen-
eral song?, which is arguably correct. However, in
the CH domain, ?Canto general? refers to a book ti-
tle from Pablo Neruda?s book of poems and should
be translated directly into English as the phrase
?Canto general?. Multiple-word phrases are more
information-bearing and more unambiguously rep-
resented than single words. They are often domain-
specific and typically absent from static lexicons.
Effective translation of such phrases is therefore par-
ticularly critical for short queries that are typically
entered by non-expert users of search engines.
The focus of the research reported in this paper
is a method to improve translation effectiveness of
phrases previously untranslated or inappropriately
translated by a standard MT system. In this work we
combine an MT system with domain-specific phrase
dictionaries mined from the online Wikipedia. The
next sections describe the construction of our dictio-
naries and their combination with the MT system.
2.1 Phrase Dictionary Construction
Our phrase translation system uses domain-specific
phrase dictionaries built by mining the online
Wikipedia5. As a multilingual hypertext medium,
Wikipedia has been shown to be a valuable new
source of translation information (Adafre and de
Rijke, 2005; Adafre and de Rijke, 2006; Bouma
et al, 2006; Declerck et al, 2006). Wikipedia is
structured as an interconnected network of articles,
5http://wikipedia.org
Figure 1: An example of Italian?English query translation.
in particular, wikipedia page titles in one language
are often linked to a multilingual database of cor-
responding terms. Unlike the web, most hyper-
links in wikipedia have a more consistent pattern
and meaningful interpretation. For example, the En-
glish wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cupid_and_Psyche hyperlinks to its counter-
part written in Italian http://it.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Amore_e_Psiche, where the basenames of
these two URLs (?Cupid and Psyche? and ?Amore e
Psiche?) are an English?Italian translation pair. The
URL basename can be considered to be a term (sin-
gle word or multiple-word phrase) that should be
translated as a unit.
Utilizing the multilingual linkage feature of
Wikipedia, we implement a three-stage automatic
process to mine wikipedia pages as a translation
source and construct phrase dictionaries in the cul-
ture heritage domain.
1. First, we performed a web crawl from the En-
glish wikipedia, Category: Culture. This cate-
gory contains links to articles and subcategories
concerning arts, religions, traditions, entertain-
ment, philosophy, etc. The crawl process is re-
stricted to the category of culture including all
of its recursive subcategories. In total, we col-
lected 458, 929 English pages.
2. For each English page obtained, we extracted
the hyperlinks to each of the query languages
(Italian and Spanish).
3. We then selected the basenames of each
pair of hyperlinks (English?Italian, English?
Spanish) as translations and added them into
our domain-specific dictionaries. The multiple-
word phrases were added into the phrase dictio-
nary for each language. These phrase dictionar-
ies are later used for dictionary-based phrase
identification.
The dictionaries we compiled contain about 90, 000,
70, 000, and 80, 000 distinct multiple-word phrases
in English, Italian, and Spanish respectively. The
majority of the phrases extracted are CH domain-
specific named entities and the rest of them are
general noun-based phrases, such as ?Music of Ire-
land? and ?Philosophy of history?. We did not ap-
ply any classifier to filter out the general noun-based
phrases, since such phrases play an equally impor-
tant role in the query translation process as domain-
specific named entities.
2.2 Improved MT-based Translation
Figure 1 shows our query translation process which
proceeds as follows:
Lexical rule-based phrase identification Given a
query, the first task is to locate phrases. Three meth-
ods of multiple-word phrase identification have been
commonly used: lexical rule-based (Ballesteros and
Croft, 1997; Hull and Grefenstette, 1996), statisti-
cal (Coenen et al, 2007; Gao et al, 2001), and syn-
tactical methods (Sharma and Raman, 2003; Gel-
bukh et al, 2004; Van de Cruys and Villada Moiro?n,
2007). The lexical rule-based approach with max-
imum forward matching was adopted in our query
translation process due to its robust performance and
computational simplicity. The query is sequentially
scanned to match the phrase dictionary. The longest
matched subsequence is taken as a phrase and trans-
lated via a domain-specific dictionary lookup. This
process is recursively invoked on the remaining part
of the query until no matches are found. The per-
formance of this approach depends strongly on the
completeness of the coverage of the adopted dictio-
nary. Our experimental results showed that at least
one phrase is detected in 90% of the testing queries,
for example, personal names, geographic locations,
and titles of various types of artworks. This indicates
that the phrase dictionaries we compiled can be used
to accurately identify phrases in web queries.
WorldLingo machine translation We translate
the original query into the target language using the
WorldLingo6 MT system. WorldLingo was selected
for the MultiMatch project because it generally pro-
vides good translation between English, Spanish,
Italian, and Dutch ? the languages relevant to the
Multimatch project. In addition, it provides a useful
API that can be used to translate queries in real-time
via HTTP transfer protocol.
Phrase translation validation For each of the
phrases previously recognized, we again pass it to
the MT system and the translation Tmt of this phrase
is returned by WorldLingo. Tmt is then replaced in
theWorldLingo translation of the query by the trans-
lations(s) Tdict from our domain-specific dictionary,
if Tmt 6= Tdict. This allows us to correct unreliable
phrase translations generated by the MT system.
3 Experimental Investigation
The goal of our experiments was to evaluate the
usefulness and the accuracy of the domain-specific
translation dictionaries. Instead of using queries
from a standard information retrieval test collection,
we experimented with queries explicitly seeking CH
information from real query log data provided by
CH organisations.
3.1 Query Log

provided by three European CH organisations par-

ticipating in the MultiMatch project, and is taken
from their archives of real user queries. The data
consists of 100 English, 1048 Italian, and 1088
Spanish distinct web queries and the number of hits
of each query. The top 200 most popular multiple-
word queries in Italian and Spanish were selected as
the queries for testing. Due to the smaller size of
the English query log, we only obtained English 53
phrasal queries.
We used two methods of evaluation: first, the dic-
tionary usefulness and the translation effectiveness
are judged extrinsically by human assessment; and
second, evaluation using a parallel Italian?English
metadata document set explored how translation af-
fects the retrieval performance of an information re-
trieval system.
3.2 Human Judgement Evaluation
The WorldLingo MT system was used to translate
Spanish and Italian queries into English and vice
versa. Our domain-specific dictionaries were used
to translate phrases within the queries into the same
target languages. It should be noted that it is not pos-
sible to directly compare the lexical coverage of our
domain-specific dictionaries and the built-in phrase
dictionaries of WorldLingo since we don?t have ac-
cess to the internal WorldLingo dictionaries.
To evaluate the usefulness of our dictionaries, we
observed the proportion of domain-specific phrases
in the various query sets that can be translated us-
ing our domain-specific dictionaries mined from the
web, but are incorrectly translated by WorldLingo.

Table 3: Some examples of improved translations using the domain-specific dictionaries. (The corrected
phrase translations are in italic.)
Namely, we tested the ability of our system to
detect and correct the presence of unreliable MT
translations for domain-specific phrases. Translated
phrases for these queries can generally be judged
unambiguously as correct or incorrect by a bilin-
gual speaker of the languages involved, and so we
are confident that assessment of translation accuracy
here does not involve significant degrees of subjec-
tivity.
As shown in Table 1, we can see that 79%, 58%,
40%, and 45% of incorrect MT-translated phrases
were able to be corrected using the domain-specific
dictionaries mined from wikipedia, in EN?IT, EN?
ES, IT?EN, and ES?EN translation tasks, respec-
tively. Our system leads to a large improvement in
MT translation for domain-specific phrases. Some
examples of improved query translations are shown
in Table 3.
We also conducted an investigation on the cor-
rectness of the translation mined from wikipedia,
as shown in Table 2. Exact correct translation is
strictly-correct single translation. Extra translation
refers to strictly-correct multiple translations, for
example, ?Cathedral of Milan, Duomo di Milan,
Duomo di Milano, Duomo of Milan, Milan Cathe-
dral? (Italian: Duomo di Milano). It is interesting to
observe that about 50% of Italian phrases are found
to have multiple correct English translations due to
multiple English wikipedia pages being redirected
to the same Italian pages. Some minor noise is ob-
served when the correct translation contains some
related additional words, such as ?Alfonso XII of
Spain? (Spanish: Alfonso XII). When used for in-
formation retrieval, this additional information can
sometimes improve effectiveness.
We are not able to manually evaluate the accuracy
of all translation pairs in our bilingual dictionaries
due to limited resources. However, our results for
sample queries from user logs demonstrate that our
translations are generally highly accurate.
3.3 Intrinsic Evaluation Using IR System
Our information retrieval experiments were per-
formed on a database of metadata associated with a
collection of 5000 CH photographs. The metadata to
describe each artifact in the collection is available in
English and in Italian. Each photograph is described
identically in both languages. We formed a separate
search index for English and Italian. Search was car-
ried out using the Lucene search engine7. We carried
out an evaluation based on this collection which pro-
ceeded as follows:
1. Submit the original queries to the index and
record the ranked list of references returned.
2. Submit the translated queries to the appropriate
index and record the ranked list of references
returned.
3. Find the correlation between the lists returned
for the native language queries and the queries
translated to that language.
4. The better translation will have the stronger
correlation with the native language list.
Due to the fact that the corpus was only complete
in the Italian and English versions, we were unable
to include the Spanish queries in this part of the eval-
uation. Also, while this collection is based in the CH
domain, some of the queries yield no relevant docu-
ments due to their specialist nature. The collection
of queries for which meaningful retrieval results are
7http://lucene.apache.org/
returned is too small to allow for a quantitative anal-
ysis of retrieval effectiveness. Therefore, we present
a qualitative analysis of some of the more interesting
cases.
3.3.1 Italian?English translations
The Italian queries cover a wide range of Italian
interests in CH. We present here a sample of some
of the more interesting results.
Arnaldo Pomodoro This refers to an Italian artist,
but the name ?Pomodoro? is translated to ?Tomato?
in English by WorldLingo. While there were no
references to the artist in the collection, all docu-
ments returned contained the term ?tomato? (refer-
ring to the vegetable) which are irrelevant to the
query. The dictionary-based translation recognized
the name and therefore left it untranslated. It is
preferable to retrieve no documents rather than to
retrieve irrelevant ones.
Amore e Psiche This refers to the sculpture en-
titled ?Cupid and Psyche? in English. This phrase
was matched in our phrase dictionary and translated
correctly. The MT system translated this as ?Love,
Psyche?. The dictionary translation was observed
to retrieve relevant documents with greater precision
since it matched against the more specific term ?Cu-
pid?, as opposed to the more general term ?Love?.
David Michaelangelo This query provided a
counterexample. The phrase dictionary added the
term ?statue? to the translated query. This led to re-
trieval of a large number of non-relevant documents.
3.3.2 English?Italian translations
As with the Italian queries, there was not much
overlap between the query log and the document col-
lection. Some of the interesting translations include:
pop art This phrase was recognized by our
domain-specific dictionary, and so was left in its
original form for searching in Italian. Interestingly,
this led to an improvement in search accuracy for the
query compared to that in the English language col-
lection. For the English index, this phrase matched
many non-relevant documents which contained the
word ?art?. However, when searching in the Italian
index, where ?art? is not a word encountered in the
general vocabulary, the phrase retrieves only 7 doc-
uments, of which 5 were relevant.
Turner East Sussex The place name ?East Sus-
sex? was correctly recognized and translated by our
phrase dictionary. However the MT system again
failed to recognise it and translated the partial term
?East? to ?Orientale?. The presence of the term
?Orientale? in the translated query resulted in many
non-relevant documents being retrieved, reducing
the precision of the query.
The examples given in this section provide anec-
dotal evidence to support the view that the auto-
matically mined domain-specific phrase dictionary
improves the performance of the retrieval system.
Query sets and relevance judgements are being cre-
ated for the MultiMatch document set by domain ex-
perts who compiled the original collections. Thus
we will be able to ensure that the query sets are a
good representative sample of the information needs
of the typical user. These test collections will allow
us to conduct full quantitative analysis of our sys-
tem.
4 Conclusions
We have presented an automatic mining system de-
veloped for construction of domain-specific phrase
dictionaries. Phrases not translated by a general
MT system are shown to be translated effectively
using these dictionaries. The extracted translations
were evaluated by human assessment and shown to
be highly accurate. We have also demonstrated a
way to combine these dictionaries with MT for top-
ical phrases in the culture heritage domain. Our ex-
perimental results show that we were able to detect
and correct a large proportion of domain-specific
phrases unsuccessfully translated by MT, and thus
improve information retrieval effectiveness and fa-
cilitate MLIA.
5 Ongoing Work
In our ongoing work we plan to further extend the
coverage of our dictionaries by exploring the min-
ing of other translations pairs from within the linked
Wikipedia pages. While the method described in this
paper has been shown to be effective for query trans-
lation, we have so far only demonstrated its behav-
ior for a very small number of queries to our CLIA
system. We are currently developing test collections
based on several CH data sets to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of our hybrid query translation method.
