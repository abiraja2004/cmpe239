Re la t ion  compar i son .  The primary property 
is relation comparison: pairs of near-synonynts 
can be COlnpared and judged as more, or less, 
similar to each other than others. For example, 
there is something similar in the relationship be- 
tween stingy/frugal and between j'at/plump. In 
each case, the first word (stingy, fat) is pejorative 
while the second (frugal, plump) has a nuance of 
being admirable or attractive. This relationship 
would not be maintained if, for example, we re- 
placed fat/plump by rotund/plump. 
Relat ion  express ions .  The second relation 
property is relation czpressions, which refers to 
people's ahil ity to use comnmn words and phrases 
to express near-synonymic relations. For exam- 
pie, mistake and era'or hoth refhr to something 
done incorrectly or improperly, but mistake is 
more general than erro% ~ceording to the usage 
,tot(; in the OALD. 
Relat ion  complex i ty .  2 The property of rela- 
tion complexity refers to the need to represent 
different relations between the same pair of near- 
synonyms, on more than one level of complexity; 
we nee(l to t)e able tso inchlde nuances that are 
relevant o a given situation and ignore others. 
Re la t ion  c reat iv i ty .  Chaflin and l lerrmann 
ohserve that "the production and recognition of' 
relations is a creative abil ity", so that the re 
lation between two words "can he readily iden- 
tified although the reader may never have con- 
sidered the relation of these particular terms be- 
tbre" \[p. 292\]. We wilt show tha, t relation ere- 
ativit 9 is equally necessary to a theory of near- 
synonymic relations, l'br example, the relation of 
2Chatf in and ' J le r r tnann  \[1988\] use the somewhat  mis leading 
terln relation ambiguity, bug we bel ieve it is ntore accurate  and 
less confus ing to use the te rm relation complexi@. 
arrange/organize 3 can be recognized as one that 
contrasts correctness with functionality, and we 
might then detect his same relationship for other 
pairs of near-synonyms (e.g., trim/shave). 
In summing up the importance of these rela- 
tion properties to a theory of semantic relations, 
Chaffm and Herrmann state that "these diverse 
phenomena must be explained by theories of re- 
lations" and "we will tind that in order to ex- 
plain relations it is necessary to assume that rela- 
tions are normally composed of more primitive l- 
ements that account for their characteristics and 
for people's abilities to make judgments about 
them" \[p. 292\]. We, believe these observations are 
equally true of theories of plesionymic relations 
and we will show that a relation-element theory 
of near-synonymy will account for these relation 
properties. 
3.2 Theoretical assumptions 
In developing their theory of semantic rela- 
tions, Chaflin and Herrmann make the following 
)'e, presentationa l ssumptions \[paraphrased from 
pp. 293-294\]: 
? A relation R, between 1;wo concepts x and y is 
composed of a set o\[" dyadic reb~tion eh,,ments 
(&,...,&): 
~:l~?j --~ (E~, . . . ,  i,;, )4 
? I~.elation elements may be hierarchically or- 
ganized so that the presence of one element 
depends on the presence of another, o1' ele- 
ments may be independent of one attother. 
In the following representation, independent 
3 "Ar range  is to put  in a p leas ing or correct order  . . .  Or -  
gan ize  is to put  into a working sys tem"  (f i 'om the usage note 
in tile OALI)).

A quar re l  is a sharp, often angry, ex- 
change of words between people . . .  A 
row is angry and may involve shouting, 
usually tbr a short time . . .  A row can 
also take place between public figures or 
organizations. 
\[\['here are two ways we can construct he relation 
between quarrel and row, depending on whether 
the argument is between people or inanimate or- 
ganizations: 
quarrel/~vw: 
(Ibrceful, fbrlnalji, emotionalji(vectorialjl)) 
quarrel/row: 
(forceful, \[nan\[mat ell (forlnalji)) 
The tirst relation states that row is more formal 
and more emotional; quarrel is more forceflll. It 
also indicates that the greater emotion of a row 
is linked to a difference in scale, the vectorial el- 
ement, which in this case refers to the diff>rent 
lengths of t ime of a quar~vl and a row. The sec- 
ond relation notes that a row can inw)lve inan- 
intate entities but, if it does, then the effect is 
more formal. Thus, we can have different rela- 
tions between plesionyms, depending on the dif- 
ferent usages of the words. 
By following the same kind of approach, we can 
(:onstruct relations for some other pairs of near- 
synonyms: 
flvwn/,qrirnaee: 
(general (formalji, torcefn\]jl) 
mistake/blunder: 
(general (formalji, fornefi~lji, carelessji)) 
fat/plump: 
(general (forcefifl (pol itqi(attractivej l))))  
We observe that the same or similar relation 
(:an hold between different 
pairs of near-synonyms, for example, ask/beseech, 
thin/ernaeiated, and ffow~@rirnace. This is mta.l- 
ogous to the case of semantic relations, which, 
as Chaffin and Herrmann note, are readily recog- 
nizable and nameable. Near-synonymic relations 
cannot be so easily labelled, but we can still see 
that some basic set of relations might be defined 
and could be used to construct new relations, l?k)r 
example, we showed that the relation between ask 
and beseech couhl be represented by the following 
structure: 
ask/beseech: 
(geuera\] (forxnal.ii, forcefulji)) 
We saw how this basic relation could also apply 
to thin/emaciated and fl'own/grimace; this sug-. 
gests that,  lor lexical-choice processing, we will 
want to keep a catalogue of existing relations from 
which new relations could be built. Another pair 
of near-synonyms, mistake and blunder, share the 
same distinctions, except hat blunder is often the 
result of carelessness (OALD). So we add to the 
existing specification to obtain the following rela- 
tion: 
re\[sick, c/blunder: 
(general (formal\[l, fo:rcefulj~, carelessji)) 
Imstty, dependencies can lead to quite com- 
plicated relations, as iu the case of fat/plu'mp, 
where the distinction of politeness (intpoliteness) 
is related to different dependencies for each near- 
synonynu the nuances of force and impoliteness 
are interdependent, asare those of politeness and 
a.ttrantiveness. 
6 The  re la t ion  proper t ies  
In Section 3.11, we set out a list of relation 1)roper- 
ties that any theory of i,ear-synonymic relations 
should be able to account lot'. In tlhis section, 
we discuss how a relation-element approach ad- 
dresses these issues. 
Re la t ion  compar i son .  By breaking down the 
relations between ptesionyms into relation ele- 
ments, we can obtain a finer degree ot' discrim- 
ination between similar words for the task of lex- 
ical choice in generation. As we discuss in \[l)i- 
Marco, \[first, and Stede 1993\], many of the se- 
mantic distinctions between plesionyms do not 
\]end themselvns to neat, taxonomic differentia- 
tion; ratlher, they are fuzzy, with plesionyms of- 
ten having an area of overlap. For exa,mple, the 
boundary between forest and wood is vague, and 
there are some situations it, which either word 
might be equally appropriate. The i)roblem is 
compounded when we are dealing with more than 
one language, for the %veakpoint' between small 
and large tracts of trees is different for differ- 
ent languages. For multi l ingual generation, we 
can compare plesionyms in different languages in 
terms of their different elelnent structures, so that 
it shouhl be easier to choose the particular word 
iu a particular language that tits a given situation. 
Re la t ion  express ions .  We have seen thai; o\[: 
ten the distinctions between near-synonyms need 
to be expressed using common words and phrases. 
But we have shown that there are ways of ex- 
pressing relations using fairly common vocabu-

logical tests, of the soN, Chaffin and IIerrmann

Re la t ion  complex i ty .  R,elations may need to 
be de.scribed ~1; more= than one hwel of c<)ml)lex- 
ity, so that the dist inct ions between two words 
may be identified in more than one way. We have 
shown how a relation-elenteut approacll allows us

that the rel)resentation of 1;he dist inctions be=

constrained, bul; not finite, vocalmlary. With a

7 hnp lement ing  near -synonymic  
re la t ions  
We are currently invesl, igating (lilferent systems 
for implement ing a relational theory o\[ near: 
synonymy. The first system that we al'e looking 
at is WordNe(; \[Miller et al:1990), whi<;h s('ems 
p~rti(;uhtrly relew~nt as words are organized both 
by semantic relations and by "synsets" (synonym 
sets). 
WordNet contains delinit ions of uomls, verbs, 
and adjectives; for now, we are COileeiitroot 
ing on the reI>resenta,tion of adje(:tiwtl near- 
synonyms. In keel)log with the l)hilosol)hy of 
WordNet,  we envisage the use <)f a i)ointer 
for each type (>\[" near-synonymic relation in 
our cal;alogue, so that we might tel)resent 
the relations betwee.n plesionyms as follows: 
r l  : (genera\[ (favourableji)) 
r2 : (general (fbl:tnaljl, forcefitl.ii)) 
r3 :  (general (favon,'abh b forcefulji)) 
Currently, the coding of a, synse.t of adjectives 
wouhl look as lbllows in Word Net: 
{ thin,  slender, erase.fated, thin1, & } 
where " th in l ,  &" indicates that members of this 
syltset are related to the '(:<)n(:e.l>t' th in /  I>y the 
simila,rity relation. 
We can imagine iml)<)siug additional structure 
on a synset and malting use of a catah)gue of near- 
synonymic relations to obtain the f<)llowing cod- 
ing: 
{ \[thin, sh;nder, rl\],  \[thin, eros.elated, r21, 
\[shin<let, emaciated, r3\], thin1, & }s 
8In WordNet, square brackets are used to indicate a lexical 
While such a representation of near synonymic  
relations would be very easy and natura l  in Word. 
Net, it relies on the solution of a uunll)er of chah 
lenging probh~ms, speeili('ally, how to generate a
comt>lete set of near-synonymic rehLtion elenl(utts, 
and how to define a constrained and reusa, ble cat- 
aJogue of nea.r- synonymic relations. 
8 Conc lus ion  
Our  evelltlla\] g()a,\[ is a knowledge representati,..>n 
h)r the <Iiscriminati(>ll of near-synonylns. We \]|ave 
1;aken a step towards such a, rel>rcsentation I)y 
investigating the nature of near-synonymic re 
lations. We have set out Ibm" properties that 
any theory of nea, r--synonymic relations h<mhI ad- 
dress, and we have shown how relat ion-element 
theory gives us a way of representing dist inct ions 
I)etween near:synonyms that a.ccounts for these 
properties. We are cui:rently invest igat ing the 
ret>resentation f our relational api)roach to near- 
synonymy in the WordNet system.
