Abstract
For the 11th straight year, the Conference
on Computational Natural Language Learn-
ing has been accompanied by a shared task
whose purpose is to promote natural language
processing applications and evaluate them in
a standard setting. In 2009, the shared task
was dedicated to the joint parsing of syntac-
tic and semantic dependencies in multiple lan-
guages. This shared task combines the shared
tasks of the previous five years under a unique
dependency-based formalism similar to the
2008 task. In this paper, we define the shared
task, describe how the data sets were created
and show their quantitative properties, report
the results and summarize the approaches of
the participating systems.
1 Introduction
Every year since 1999, the Conference on Com-
putational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL)
launches a competitive, open ?Shared Task?. A
common (?shared?) task is defined and datasets are
provided for its participants. In 2004 and 2005, the
shared tasks were dedicated to semantic role label-
ing (SRL) in a monolingual setting (English). In
2006 and 2007 the shared tasks were devoted to
the parsing of syntactic dependencies, using corpora
from up to 13 languages. In 2008, the shared task
(Surdeanu et al, 2008) used a unified dependency-
based formalism, which modeled both syntactic de-
pendencies and semantic roles for English. The
CoNLL-2009 Shared Task has built on the 2008 re-
sults by providing data for six more languages (Cata-
lan, Chinese, Czech, German, Japanese and Span-
ish) in addition to the original English1. It has thus
naturally extended the path taken by the five most
recent CoNLL shared tasks.
As in 2008, the CoNLL-2009 shared task com-
bined dependency parsing and the task of identify-
ing and labeling semantic arguments of verbs (and
other parts of speech whenever available). Partici-
pants had to choose from two tasks:
? Joint task (syntactic dependency parsing and
semantic role labeling), or
? SRL-only task (syntactic dependency parses
have been provided by the organizers, using
state-of-the art parsers for the individual lan-
guages).
1There are some format changes and deviations from the
2008 task data specification; see Sect. 2.3
1
In contrast to the previous year, the evaluation data
indicated which words were to be dealt with (for the
SRL task). In other words, (predicate) disambigua-
tion was still part of the task, whereas the identi-
fication of argument-bearing words was not. This
decision was made to compensate for the significant
differences between languages and between the an-
notation schemes used.
The ?closed? and ?open? challenges have been
kept from last year as well; participants could have
chosen one or both. In the closed challenge, systems
had to be trained strictly with information contained
in the given training corpus; in the open challenge,
systems could have been developed making use of
any kind of external tools and resources.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
fines the task, including the format of the data, the
evaluation metrics, and the two challenges. A sub-
stantial portion of the paper (Section 3) is devoted
to the description of the conversion and develop-
ment of the data sets in the additional languages.
Section 4 shows the main results of the submitted
systems in the Joint and SRL-only tasks. Section 5
summarizes the approaches implemented by partic-
ipants. Section 6 concludes the paper. In all sec-
tions, we will mention some of the differences be-
tween last year?s and this year?s tasks while keeping
the text self-contained whenever possible; for details
and observations on the English data, please refer to
the overview paper of the CoNLL-2008 Shared Task
(Surdeanu et al, 2008) and to the references men-
tioned in the sections describing the other languages.
2 Task Definition
In this section we provide the definition of the shared
task; after introducing the two challenges and the
two tasks the participants were to choose, we con-
tinue with the format of the shared task data, fol-
lowed by a description of the evaluation metrics
used.
For three of the languages (Czech, English and
German), out-of-domain data (OOD) have also been
prepared for the final evaluation, following the same
guidelines and formats.
2.1 Closed and Open Challenges
Similarly to the CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2008
shared tasks, this shared task evaluation is separated
into two challenges:
Closed Challenge The aim of this challenge was to
compare performance of the participating systems in
a fair environment. Systems had to be built strictly
with information contained in the given training cor-
pus, and tuned with the development section. In
addition, the lexical frame files (such as the Prop-
Bank and NomBank for English, the valency dictio-
nary PDT-Vallex for Czech etc.) were provided and
may have been used. These restrictions mean that
outside parsers (not trained by the participants? sys-
tems) could not be used. However, we did provide
the output of a single, state-of-the-art dependency
parser for each language so that participants could
build a SRL-only system (using the provided parses
as inputs) within the closed challenge (as opposed to
the 2008 shared task).
Open Challenge Systems could have been devel-
oped making use of any kind of external tools and
resources. The only condition was that such tools or
resources must not have been developed with the an-
notations of the test set, both for the input and output
annotations of the data. In this challenge, we were
interested in learning methods which make use of
any tools or resources that might improve the per-
formance. The comparison of different systems in
this setting may not be fair, and thus ranking of sys-
tems is not necessarily important.
2.2 Joint and SRL-only tasks
In 2008, systems participating in the open challenge
could have used state-of-the-art parsers for the syn-
tactic dependency part of the task. This year, we
have provided the output of these parsers for all the
languages in an uniform way, thus allowing an or-
thogonal combination of the two tasks and the two
challenges. For the SRL-only task, participants in
the closed challenge simply had to use the provided
parses only.
Despite the provisions for the SRL-only task, we
are more interested in the approaches and results of
the Joint task. Therefore, primary system ranking is
provided for the Joint task while additional measures
2
are computed for various combinations of parsers
and SRL methods across the tasks and challenges.
2.3 Data Format
The data format used in this shared task has been
based on the CoNLL-2008 shared task, with some
differences. The data follows these general rules:
? The files contain sentences separated by a blank
line.
? A sentence consists of one or more tokens and
the information for each token is represented on
a separate line.
? A token consists of at least 14 fields. The fields
are separated by one or more whitespace char-
acters (spaces or tabs). Whitespace characters
are not allowed within fields.
The data is thus a large table with whitespace-
separated fields (columns). The fields provided in
the data are described in Table 1. They are identical
for all languages, but they may differ in contents;
for example, some fields might not be filled for all
the languages provided (such as the FEAT or PFEAT
fields).
For the SRL-only task, participants have been
provided will all the data but the PRED and
APREDs, which they were supposed to fill in with
their correct values. However, they did not have
to determine which tokens are predicates (or more
precisely, which are the argument-bearing tokens),
since they were marked by ?Y? in the FILLPRED
field.
For the Joint task, participants could not (in ad-
dition to the PRED and APREDs) see the gold-
standard nor the predicted syntactic dependencies
(HEAD, PHEAD) and their labels (DEPREL, PDE-
PREL). These syntactic dependencies were also to
be filled by participants? systems.
In both tasks, participants have been free to
use any other data (columns) provided, except the
LEMMA, POS and FEAT columns (to get more ?re-
alistic? results using only their automatically pre-
dicted variants PLEMMA, PPOS and PFEAT).
Besides the corpus proper, predicate dictionaries
have been provided to participants in order to be able
to properly match the predicates to the tokens in the
corpus; their contents could have been used e.g. as
features for the PRED/APREDs predictions (or even
for the syntactic dependencies, i.e., for filling in the
PHEAD and PDEPREL fields).
The system of filling-in the APREDs follows
the 2008 pattern; for each argument-bearing token
(predicate), a new APREDn column is created in the
order in which the predicate token is encountered
within the sentence (i.e., based on its ID seen as a
numerical value). Then, for each token in the sen-
tence, the value in the intersection of the APREDn
column and the token row is either left unfilled
(if the token is not an argument), or a predicate-
argument label(s) is(are) filled in.
The differences between the English-only 2008
task and this year?s multilingual task can be briefly
summarized as follows:
? only ?split?2 lemmas and forms have been pro-
vided in the English datasets (for the other lan-
guages, original tokenization from the respec-
tive treebanks has been used);
? rich morphological features have been added
wherever available;
? syntactic dependencies by state-of-the-art
parsers have been provided (for the SRL-only
task);
? multiple semantic labels for a single token have
been allowed (and properly evaluated) in the
APREDs columns;
? predicates have been pre-identified and marked
in both the training and test data;
? some of the fields (e.g. the APREDx) and val-
ues (ARG0? A0 etc.) have been renamed.
2.4 Evaluation Measures
It was required that participants submit results in all
seven languages in the chosen task and in any of (or
both) the challenges. Submission of out-of-domain
data files has been optional.
The main evaluation measure, according to which
systems are primarily compared, is the Joint task,
2Splitting of forms and lemmas in English has been intro-
duced in the 2008 shared task to match the tokenization con-
vention for the arguments in NomBank.

1 ID Token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence
2 FORM Form or punctuation symbol (the token; ?split? for English)
3 LEMMA Gold-standard lemma of FORM
4 PLEMMA Automatically predicted lemma of FORM
5 POS Gold-standard POS (major POS only)
6 PPOS Automatically predicted major POS by a language-specific tagger

closed challenge, Macro F1 score. However, scores
can also be computed for a number of other condi-
tions:
? Task: Joint or SRL-only
? Challenge: open or closed
? Domain: in-domain data (IDD, separated from
training corpus) or out-of-domain data (OOD)
Joint task participants are also evaluated separately
on the syntactic dependency task (labeled attach-
ment score, LAS). Finally, systems competing in
both tasks are compared on semantic role labeling
alone, to assess the impact of the the joint pars-
ing/SRL task compared to an SRL-only task on pre-
parsed data.
Finally, as an explanatory measure, precision and
recall of the semantic labeling task have been com-
puted and tabulated.
We have decided to omit several evaluation fig-
ures that were reported in previous years, such as the
percentage of completely correct sentences (?Exact
Match?), unlabeled scores, etc. With seven lan-
guages, two tasks (plus two challenges, and the
IDD/OOD distinction), there are enough results to
get lost even as it is.
2.4.1 Syntactic Dependency Measures
The LAS score is defined similarly as in the pre-
vious shared tasks, as the percentage of tokens for
which a system has predicted the correct HEAD and
DEPREL columns. The unlabeled attachment score
(UAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct
HEAD regardless if the DEPREL is correct, has not
been officially computed this year. No precision and
recall measures are applicable, since all systems are
supposed to output a single dependency with a single
label (see also below the footnote to the description
of the combined score).
2.4.2 Semantic Labeling Measures
The semantic propositions are evaluated by con-
verting them to semantic dependencies, i.e., we cre-
ate n semantic dependencies from every predicate
to its n arguments. These dependencies are labeled
with the labels of the corresponding arguments. Ad-
ditionally, we create a semantic dependency from
each predicate to a virtual ROOT node. The latter
dependencies are labeled with the predicate senses.
This approach guarantees that the semantic depen-
dency structure conceptually forms a single-rooted,
connected (but not necessarily acyclic) graph. More
importantly, this scoring strategy implies that if a
system assigns the incorrect predicate sense, it still
receives some points for the arguments correctly as-
signed. For example, for the correct proposition:
verb.01: A0, A1, AM-TMP
the system that generates the following output for
the same argument tokens:
4
verb.02: A0, A1, AM-LOC
receives a labeled precision score of 2/4 because two
out of four semantic dependencies are incorrect: the
dependency to ROOT is labeled 02 instead of 01
and the dependency to the AM-TMP is incorrectly la-
beled AM-LOC. Using this strategy we compute pre-
cision, recall, and F1 scores for semantic dependen-
cies (labeled only).
For some languages (Czech, Japanese) there may
be more than one label in a given argument position;
for example, this happens in Czech in special cases
of reciprocity when the same token serves as two or
more arguments to the same predicate. The scorer
takes this into account and considers such cases to
be (as if) multiple predicate-argument relations for
the computation of the evaluation measures.
For example, for the correct proposition:
v1f1: ACT|EFF, ADDR
the system that generates the following output for
the same argument tokens:
v1f1: ACT, ADDR|PAT
receives a labeled precision score of 3/4 because
the PAT is incorrect and labeled recall 3/4 be-
cause the EFF is missing (should the ACT|EFF and
ADDR|PAT be taken as atomic values, the scores
would then be zero).
2.4.3 Combined Syntactic and Semantic Score
We combine the syntactic and semantic measures
into one global measure using macro averaging. We
compute macro precision and recall scores by aver-
aging the labeled precision and recall for semantic
dependencies with the LAS for syntactic dependen-
cies:3
LMP = Wsem ? LPsem + (1?Wsem) ? LAS (1)
LMR = Wsem ? LRsem + (1 ?Wsem) ? LAS (2)
where LMP is the labeled macro precision and
LPsem is the labeled precision for semantic depen-
dencies. Similarly, LMR is the labeled macro re-
call and LRsem is the labeled recall for semantic
dependencies. Wsem is the weight assigned to the
3We can do this because the LAS for syntactic dependen-
cies is a special case of precision and recall, where the predicted
number of dependencies is equal to the number of gold depen-
dencies.
semantic task.4 The macro labeled F1 score, which
was used for the ranking of the participating sys-
tems, is computed as the harmonic mean of LMP
and LMR.
3 Data
The unification of the data formats for the various
languages appeared to be a challenge in itself. We
will briefly describe the processes of the conversion
of the existing treebanks in the seven languages of
the CoNLL-2009 shared task. In many instances,
the original treebanks had to be not only converted
format-wise, but also merged with other resources in
order to generate useful training and testing data that
fit the task description.
3.1 The Input Corpora
The data used as the input for the transformations
aimed at arriving at the data contents and format de-
scribed in Sect. 2.3 are described in (Taule? et al,
2008), (Xue and Palmer, 2009), (Hajic? et al, 2006),
(Surdeanu et al, 2008), (Burchardt et al, 2006) and
(Kawahara et al, 2002).
In the subsequent sections, the procedures for the
data conversion for the individual languages are de-
scribed. The data has been collected by the main
organization site and checked for format errors, and
repackaged for distribution.
There were three packages of the data distributed
to the participants: Trial, Training plus Develop-
ment, and Evaluation. The Trial data were rather
small, just to give the feeling of the format and
languages involved. A visual representation of the
Trial data was also created to make understanding
of the data easier. Any data in the same format
can be transformed and displayed in the Tree Editor
TrEd5 (Pajas and ?Ste?pa?nek, 2008) with the CoNLL
2009 Shared Task extension that can be installed
from within the editor. A sample visualization of an
English sentence after its conversion to the shared
task format (Sect. 2.3) is in Fig. 1.
Due to licensing requirements, every package of
the data had to be split into two portions. One
portion (Catalan, German, Japanese, and Spanish
data) was published on the task?s webpage for down-

Figure 1: Visualisation of the English sentence ?And sometimes a reputable charity with a houshold name gets used
and doesn?t even know it.? (Penn Treebank, wsj 0559) showing jointly the labeled syntactic and semantic depen-
dencies. The basic tree shape comes from the syntactic dependencies; syntactic labels and POS tags are on the 2nd
line at each node. Semantic dependencies which do not follow the syntactic ones use dotted lines. Predicate senses
in parentheses (use:01, ...) follow the word label. SRLs (A0, AM-TMP, ...) are on the last line. Please note that
multiple semantic dependencies (e.g., there are four for charity: A0? know, A1? gets, A1? used, A1? name)
and self-dependencies (name) appear in this sentence.
load, the other portion (Czech, English, and Chinese
data) was invoiced and distributed by the Linguistic
Data Consortium under a special agreement free of
charge.
Distribution of the Evaluation package was a bit
more complicated, because there were two types of
the packages - one for the Joint task and one for the
SRL-only task. Every participant had to subscribe
to one of the two tasks; subsequently, they obtained
the appropriate data (again, from the webpage and
LDC).
Prior to release, each data file was checked to
eliminate errors. The following test were carried
out:
? For every sentence, number of PREDs rows
matches the number of APREDs columns.
? The first line of each file is never empty, while
the last line always is.
? The first character on a non-empty line is al-
ways a digit, the last one is never a whitespace.
? The number of empty lines (i.e. the number
of sentences) equals the number of lines begin-
ning with ?1?.
? The data contain no spaces nor double tabs.
Some statistics on the data can be seen in Ta-
bles 2, 3 and 4. Whereas the training sizes of the
data have not been that different as they were e.g.
for the 2007 shared task on multilingual dependency
parsing (Nivre et al, 2007)6, substantial differences
existed in the distribution of the predicates and ar-
guments, the input features, the out-of-vocabulary
rates, and other statistical characteristics of the data.
Data sizes have been relatively uniform in all the
datasets, with Japanese having the smallest dataset

containing data for SRL annotation training. To
compensate at least for the dependency parsing part,
an additional, large Japanese corpus with syntactic
dependency annotation has been provided.
The average sentence length, the vocabulary sizes
for FORM and LEMMA fields and the OOV rates
characterize quite naturally the properties of the re-
spective languages (in the domain of the training and
evaluation data). It is no surprise that the FORM
OOV rate is the highest for Czech, a highly inflec-
tional language, and that the LEMMA OOV rate is
the highest for German (as a consequence of keeping
compounds as a single lemma). The other statistics
also reflect (to a large extent) the annotation speci-
fication and conventions used for the original tree-
banks and/or the result of the conversion process to
the unified CoNLL-2009 Shared Task format.
Starting with the POS and FEAT fields, it can be
seen that Catalan, Czech and Spanish use only the
12 major part-of-speech categories as values of the
POS field (with richly populated FEAT field); En-
glish and Chinese are the opposite extreme, disre-
garding the use of the FEAT field completely and
coding everything as a POS value. While for Chi-
nese this is quite understandable, English follows the
PTB tradition in this respect. German and Japanese
use relatively rich set of values in both the POS and
FEAT fields.
For the dependency relations (DEPREL), all
the languages use a similarly-sized set except for
Japanese, which only encodes the distinction be-
tween a root and a dependent node (and some in-
frequent special ones).
Evaluation data are over 10% of the size of the
training data for Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Japanese
and Spanish and roughly 5% for English and Ger-
man.
Table 3 shows the distribution of the five most fre-
quent dependency relations (determined as part of
the subtask of syntactic parsing). With the exception
of Japanese, which essentially does not label depen-
dency relations at this level, all the other languages
show little difference in this distribution. For exam-
ple, the unconditioned probability of ?subjects? is
almost the same for all the six other languages (be-
tween 6 and 8 percent). The probability mass cov-
ered by the first five most frequent DEPRELs is also
almost the same (again, except for Japanese), sug-
gesting that the labeling task might have similar dif-
ficulty7. The most skewed one is for Czech (after
Japanese).
Table 4 shows similar statistics for the argument
labels (PRED/APREDs); it also adds the average
number of arguments per ?predicate? token, since
this is part of the SRL task8. It is apparent from the
comparison of the ?Total? rows in this table and Ta-
ble 3 that the first five argument labels cover more
that their syntactic counterparts. For example, the
arguments A0-A4 account for all but 3% of all ar-
guments labels, whereas Spanish and Catalan have
much more rich set of argument labels, with a high
entropy of the most-frequent-label distribution.
3.2 Catalan and Spanish
The Catalan and Spanish datasets (Taule? et al, 2008)
were generated from the AnCora corpora9 through
an automatic conversion process from a constituent-
based formalism to dependencies (Civit et al, 2006).
AnCora corpora contain about half million words
for Catalan and Spanish annotated with syntactic
and semantic information. Text sources for the Cata-
lan corpus are EFE news agency (?75Kw), ACN
Catalan news agency (?225Kw), and ?El Perio?dico?
newspaper (?200Kw). The Spanish corpus comes
from the Lexesp Spanish balanced corpus (?75Kw),
the EFE Spanish news agency (?225Kw), and the
Spanish version of ?El Perio?dico? (?200Kw). The
subset from ?El Perio?dico? corresponds to the same
news in Catalan and Spanish, spanning from January
to December 2000.
Linguistic annotation is the same in both lan-
guages and includes: PoS tags with morphologi-
cal features (gender, number, person, etc.), lemma-
tization, syntactic dependencies (syntactic func-
tions), semantic dependencies (arguments and the-
matic roles), named entities and predicate semantic
classes (Lexical Semantic Structure, LSS). Tag sets
are shared by the two languages.
If we take into account the complete PoS tags,
7Yes, this is overgeneralization since this distribution does
not condition on the features, dependencies etc. But as a rough
measure, it often correlates well with the results.
8A number below 1 means there are some argument-bearing
words (often nouns) which have no arguments in the particular
sentence in which they appear.

AnCora has 280 different labels. Considering only
the main syntactic categories, the tag set is reduced
to 47 tags. The syntactic tag set consists of 50 dif-
ferent syntactic functions. Regarding semantic ar-
guments, we distinguish Arg0, Arg1, Arg2, Arg3,
Arg4, ArgM, and ArgL. The first five tags are num-
bered from less to more obliqueness with respect
to the verb, ArgM corresponds to adjuncts. The
list of thematic roles consists of 20 different labels:
AGT (Agent), AGI (Induced Agent), CAU (Cause),
EXP (Experiencer), SCR (Source), PAT (Patient),
TEM (Theme), ATR (Attribute), BEN (Beneficiary),
EXT (Extension), INS (Instrument), LOC (Loca-
tive), TMP (Time), MNR (Manner), ORI (Origin),
DES (Goal), FIN (Purpose), EIN (Initial State), EFI
(Final State), and ADV (Adverbial). Each argument
position can map onto specific thematic roles. By
way of example, Arg1 can be PAT, TEM or EXT. For
Named Entities, we distinguish six types: Organiza-
tion, Person, Location, Date, Number, and Others.
An incremental process guided the annotation of
AnCora, since semantics depends on morphosyntax,
and syntax relies on morphology. This procedure
made it possible to check, correct, and complete
the previous annotations, thus guaranteeing the final
quality of the corpora and minimizing the error rate.
The annotation process was carried out sequentially
from lower to upper layers of linguistic description.
All resulting layers are independent of each other,
thus making easier the data management. The ini-
tial annotation was performed manually for syntax,
semiautomatically in the case of arguments and the-
matic roles, and fully automatically for PoS (Mart??
et al, 2007; Ma`rquez et al, 2007).
The Catalan and Spanish AnCora corpora were
straightforwardly translated into the CoNLL-2009
shared task formatting (information about named
entities was skipped in this process). The resulting
Catalan corpus (including training, development and
test partitions) contains 16,786 sentences with an av-
erage length of 29.59 lexical tokens per sentence.
Long sentences abound in this corpus. For instance,
10.73% of the sentences are longer than 50 tokens,
and 4.42% are longer than 60. The corpus con-
tains 47,537 annotated predicates (2.83 predicates
per sentence, on average) with 107,171 arguments
(2.25 arguments per predicate, on average). From
the latter, 73.89% correspond to core arguments and
26.11% to adjuncts. Numbers for the Spanish cor-
pus are comparable in all aspects: 17,709 sentences
with 29.84 lexical tokens on average (11.58% of the
sentences longer than 50 tokens, 4.07% longer than
60); 54,075 predicates (3.05 per sentence, on aver-
age) and 122,478 arguments (2.26 per predicate, on
average); 73.34% core arguments and 26.66% ad-
juncts.
The following are important features of the Cata-
lan and Spanish corpora in the CoNLL-2009 shared
task setting: (1) all dependency trees are projective;
(2) no word can be the argument of more than one
predicate in a sentence; (3) semantic dependencies
completely match syntactic dependency structures
(i.e., no new edges are introduced by the semantic
structure); (4) only verbal predicates are annotated
(with exceptional cases referring to words that can
be adjectives and past participles); (5) the corpus is
segmented so multi-words, named entities, temporal
expressions, compounds, etc. are grouped together;
and (6) segmentation also accounts for elliptical pro-
nouns (there are marked as empty lexical tokens ?_?
with a pronoun POS tag).
Finally, the predicted columns (PLEMMA,
PPOS, and PFEAT) have been generated with the
FreeLing Open source suite of Language Analyz-
ers10. Accuracy in PLEMMA and PPOS columns
is above 95% for the two languages. PHEAD
and PDEPREL columns have been generated using
MaltParser11. Parsing accuracy (LAS) is above 86%
for the the two languages.
3.3 Chinese
The Chinese Corpus for the 2009 CoNLL Shared
Task was generated by merging the Chinese Tree-
bank (Xue et al, 2005) and the Chinese Proposition
Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2009) and then converting
the constituent structure to a dependency formalism
as specified in the CoNLL Shared Task. The Chi-
nese data used in the shared task is based on Chinese
Treebank 6.0 and the Chinese Proposition Bank 2.0,
both of which are publicly available via the Linguis-
tic Data Consortium.
The Chinese Treebank Project originated at Penn
and was later moved to University of Colorado at
10http://www.lsi.upc.es/?nlp/freeling
11http://w3.msi.vxu.se/?jha/maltparser
9
Boulder. Now it is the process of being to moved
to Brandeis University. The data sources of the Chi-
nese Treebank range from Xinhua newswire (main-
land China), Hong Kong news, and Sinorama Maga-
zine (Taiwan). More recently under DARPA GALE
funding it has been expanded to include broadcast
news, broadcast conversation, news groups and web
log data. It currently has over one million words
and is fully segmented, POS-tagged and annotated
with phrase structure. The version of the Chinese
Treebank used in this shared task, CTB 6.0, includes
newswire, magazine articles, and transcribed broad-
cast news 12. The training set has 609,060 tokens,
the development set has 49,620 tokens, and the test
set has 73,153 tokens.
The Chinese Proposition Bank adds a layer of se-
mantic annotation to the syntactic parses in the Chi-
nese Treebank. This layer of semantic annotation
mainly deals with the predicate-argument structure
of Chinese verbs and their nominalizations. Each
major sense (called frameset) of a predicate takes a
number of core arguments annotated with numeri-
cal labels Arg0 through Arg5 which are defined in
a predicate-specific manner. The Chinese Proposi-
tion Bank also annotates adjunctive arguments such
as locative, temporal and manner modifiers of the
predicate. The version of the Chinese Propbank used
in this CoNLL Shared Task is CPB 2.0, but nominal
predicates are excluded because the annotation is in-
complete.
Since the Chinese Treebank is annotated with
constituent structures, the conversion and merging
procedure converts the constituent structures to de-
pendencies by identifying the head for each con-
stituent in a parse tree and making its sisters its de-
pendents. The Chinese Propbank pointers are then
shifted from the entire constituent to the head of that
constituent. The conversion procedure identifies the
head by first exploiting the structural information
in the syntactic parse and detecting six broad cate-
gories of syntactic relations that hold between the
head and its dependents (predication, modification,
complementation, coordination, auxiliary, and flat)
and then designating the head based on these rela-
tions. In particular, the first conjunct of a coordina-
12A small number of files were taken out of the CoNLL
shared task data due to conversion problems and time con-
straints to fix them.
tion structure is designated as the head and the heads
of the other conjuncts are the conjunctions preced-
ing them. The conjunctions all ?modify? the first
conjunct.
3.4 Czech
For the training, development and evaluation data,
Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 was used (Hajic?
et al, 2006). For the out-of-domain evaluation data,
part of the Czech side of the Prague Czech-English
Dependency Treebank (version 2, under construc-
tion) was used13, see also ( ?Cmejrek et al, 2004). For
the OOD data, no manual annotation of LEMMA,
POS, and FEAT existed, so the predicted values
were used. The same conversion procedure has been
applied to both sources.
The FORM column was created from the form
element of the morphological layer, not from the
?token? from the word-form layer. Therefore, most
typos, errors in word segmentation and tokenization
are corrected and numerals are normalized.
The LEMMA column was created from the
lemma element of the morphological layer. Only
the initial string of the element was used, so there is
no distinction between homonyms. However, some
components of the detailed lemma explanation were
incorporated into the FEAT column (see below).
The POS column was created form the morpho-
logical tag element, its first character more pre-
cisely.
The FEAT column was created from the remain-
ing characters of the tag element. In addition, the
special feature ?Sem? corresponds to a semantic fea-
ture of the lemma.
For the HEAD and DEPREL columns, the PDT
analytical layer was used. The DEPREL was taken
from the analytic function (the afun node at-
tribtue). There are 27 possible values for afun el-
ement: Pred, Pnom, AuxV, Sb, Obj, Atr, Adv,
Atv, AtvV, Coord, Apos, ExD, and a number
of auxiliary and ?double-function? labels. The first
nine of these are the ?most interesting? from the
point of view of the shared task, since they relate to
semantics more closely than the rest (at least from
the linguistic point of view). The HEAD is a pointer
to its parent, which means the PDT?s ord attribute
13http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pedt
10
(within-sentence ID / word position number) of the
parent. If a node is a member of a coordination
or apposition (is_member element), its DEPREL
obtains the _M suffix. The parenthesis annotation
(is_parenthesis_root element) was ignored.
The PRED and APREDs columns were created
from the tectogrammatical layer of PDT 2.0 and the
valency lexicon PDT-Vallex according to the follow-
ing rules:
? Every line corresponding to an analytical node
referenced by a lexical reference (a/lex.rf)
from the tectogrammatical layer has a PRED
value filled. If the referring non-generated
tectogrammatical node (is_generated not
equal to 1) has a valency frame assigned
(val_frame.rf), the value of PRED is the
identifier of the frame. Otherwise, it is set to
the same value as the LEMMA column.
? For every tectogrammatical node, a corre-
sponding analytical node is searched for:
1. If the tectogrammatical node is not
generated and has a lexical reference
(a/lex.rf), the referenced node is
taken.
2. Otherwise, if the tectogrammatical node
has a coreference (coref_text.rf or
coref_gram.rf) or complement refer-
ence (compl.rf) to a node that has an
analytical node assigned (by 1. or 2.), the
assigned node is taken.
APRED columns are filled with respect to the
following correspondence: for a tectogrammatical
node P and its effective child C with functor F, the
column for P?s corresponding analytical node at the
row for C?s corresponding analytical node is filled
with F. Some nodes can thus have several functors
in one APRED column, separated by a vertical bar
(see Sect. 2.4.2).
PLEMMA, PPOS and PFEAT were gener-
ated by the (cross-trained) morphological tagger
MORCE (Spoustova? et al, 2009), which gives full
combined accuracy (PLEMMA+PPOS+PFEAT)
slightly under 96%.
PHEAD and PDEPREL were generated by
the (cross-trained) MST parser for Czech (Chu?
Liu/Edmonds algorithm, (McDonald et al, 2005)),
which has typical dependency accuracy around
85%.
The valency lexicon, converted from (Hajic? et al,
2003), has four columns:
1. lemma (can occur several times in the lexicon,
with different frames)
2. frame identifier (as found in the PRED column)
3. list of space-separated actants and obligatory
members of the frame
4. example(s)
The source of the out-of-domain data uses an
extended valency lexicon (because of out-of-
vocabulary entries). For simplicity, the extended
lexicon was not provided; instead, such words were
not marked as predicates in the OOD data (their
FILLPRED was set to ?_?) and thus not evaluated.
3.5 English
The English corpus is almost identical to the cor-
pus used in the closed challenge in the CoNLL-2008
shared task evaluation (Surdeanu et al, 2008). This
corpus was generated through a process that merges
several input corpora and converts them from the
constituent-based formalism to dependencies. The
following corpora were used as input to the merging
procedure:
? Penn Treebank 3 ? The Penn Treebank 3 cor-
pus (Marcus et al, 1994) consists of hand-
coded parses of the Wall Street Journal (test,
development and training) and a small subset
of the Brown corpus (W. N. Francis and H.
Kucera, 1964) (test only).
? BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type
Corpus ? BBN?s NE annotation of the Wall
Street Journal corpus (Weischedel and Brun-
stein, 2005) takes the form of SGML inline
markup of text, tokenized to be completely
compatible with the Penn Treebank annotation.
For the CoNLL-2008 shared task evaluation,
this corpus was extended by the task organizers
to cover the subset of the Brown corpus used as
a secondary testing dataset. From this corpus
we only used NE boundaries to derive NAME
11
dependencies between NE tokens, e.g., we cre-
ate a NAME dependency from Mary to Smith
given the NE mention Mary Smith.
? Proposition Bank I (PropBank) ? The Prop-
Bank annotation (Palmer et al, 2005) classifies
the arguments of all the main verbs in the Penn
Treebank corpus, other than be. Arguments are
numbered (Arg0, Arg1, . . .) based on lexical
entries or frame files. Different sets of argu-
ments are assumed for different rolesets. De-
pendent constituents that fall into categories in-
dependent of the lexical entries are classified as
various types of adjuncts (ArgM-TMP, -ADV,
etc.).
? NomBank ? NomBank annotation (Meyers et
al., 2004) uses essentially the same framework
as PropBank to annotate arguments of nouns.
Differences between PropBank and NomBank
stem from differences between noun and verb
argument structure; differences in treatment of
nouns and verbs in the Penn Treebank; and dif-
ferences in the sophistication of previous re-
search about noun and verb argument structure.
Only the subset of nouns that take arguments
are annotated in NomBank and only a subset of
the non-argument siblings of nouns are marked
as ArgM.
The complete merging process and the conversion
from the constituent representation to dependencies
is detailed in (Surdeanu et al, 2008).
The main difference between the 2008 and 2009
version of the corpora is the generation of word lem-
mas. In the 2008 version the only lemmas pro-
vided were predicted using the built-in lemmatizer
in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) based on the most fre-
quent sense for the form and the predicted part-of-
speech tag. These lemmas are listed in the 2009
corpus under the PLEMMA column. The LEMMA
column in the 2009 version of the corpus contains
lemmas generated using the same algorithm but us-
ing the correct Treebank part-of-speech tags. Addi-
tionally, the PHEAD and PDEPREL columns were
generated using MaltParser14, similarly to the open
challenge corpus in the CoNLL 2008 shared task.

MaltParser.html
3.6 German
The German in-domain dataset is based on the an-
notated verb instances of the SALSA corpus (Bur-
chardt et al, 2006), a total of around 40k sen-
tences15. SALSA provides manual semantic role
annotation on top of the syntactically annotated
TIGER newspaper corpus, one of the standard Ger-
man treebanks. The original SALSA corpus uses se-
mantic roles in the FrameNet paradigm. We con-
structed mappings between FrameNet frame ele-
ments and PropBank argument positions at the level
of frame-predicate pairs semi-automatically. For the
frame elements of each frame-predicate pair, we first
identified the semantically defined PropBank Arg-
0 and Arg-1 positions. To do so, we annotated a
small number of very abstract frame elements with
these labels (Agent, Actor, Communicator as Arg-
0, and Theme, Effect, Message as Arg-1) and per-
colated these labels through the FrameNet hierar-
chy, adding further manual labels where necessary.
Then, we used frequency and grammatical realiza-
tion information to map the remaining roles onto
higher-numbered Arg roles. We considerably sim-
plified the annotations provided by SALSA, which
use a rather complex annotation scheme. In partic-
ular, we removed annotation for multi-word expres-
sions (which may be non-contiguous), annotations
involving multiple frames for the same predicate
(metaphors, underspecification), and inter-sentence
roles.
The out-of-domain dataset was taken from a study
on the multi-lingual projection of FrameNet annota-
tion (Pado and Lapata, 2005). It is sampled from
the EUROPARL corpus and was chosen to maxi-
mize the lexical coverage, i.e., it contains of a large
number of infrequent predicates. Both syntactic and
semantic structure were annotated manually, in the
TIGER and SALSA format, respectively. Since it
uses a simplified annotation schemes, we did not
have to discard any annotation.
For both datasets, we converted the syntactic
TIGER (Brants et al, 2002) representations into de-
pendencies with a similar set of head-finding rules
used for the preparation of the CoNLL-X shared task
German dataset. Minor modifications (for the con-
15Note, however, that typically not all predicates in each sen-
tence are annotated (cf. Table 2).
12
version of person names and coordinations) were
made to achieve better consistency with datasets
of other languages. Since the TIGER annotation
allows non-contiguous constituents, the resulting
dependencies can be non-projective. Secondary
edges were discarded in the conversion. As for the
automatically constructed features, we used Tree-
Tagger (Schmid, 1994) to produce the PLEMMA
and PPOS columns, and the Morphisto morphol-
ogy (Zielinski and Simon, 2008) for PFEAT.
3.7 Japanese
For Japanese, we used the Kyoto University Text
Corpus (Kawahara et al, 2002), which consists of
approximately 40k sentences taken from Mainichi
Newspapers. Out of them, approximately 5k sen-
tences are annotated with syntactic and semantic de-
pendencies, and are used the training, development
and test data of this year?s shared task. The remain-
ing sentences, which are annotated with only syntac-
tic dependencies, are provided for the training cor-
pus of syntactic dependency parsers.
This corpus adopts a dependency structure repre-
sentation, and thus the conversion to the CoNLL-
2009 format was relatively straightforward. How-
ever, since the original dependencies are annotated
on the basis of phrases (Japanese bunsetsu), we
needed to automatically convert the original annota-
tions to word-based ones using several criteria. We
used the following basic criteria: the words except
the last word in a phrase depend on the next (right)
word, and the last word in a phrase basically depends
on the head word of the governing phrase.
Semantic dependencies are annotated for both
verbal predicates and nominal predicates. The se-
mantic roles (APRED columns) consist of 41 sur-
face cases, many of which are case-marking post-
positions such as ga (nominative), wo (accusative)
and ni (dative). Semantic frame discrimination is not
annotated, and so the PRED column is the same as
the LEMMA column. The original corpus contains
coreference annotations and inter-sentential seman-
tic dependencies, such as inter-sentential zero pro-
nouns and bridging references, but we did not use
these annotations, which are not the target of this
year?s shared task.
To produce the PLEMMA, PPOS and PFEAT
columns, we used the morphological analyzer JU-
MAN 16 and the dependency and case structure an-
alyzer KNP 17. To produce the PHEAD and PDE-
PREL columns, we used the MSTParser 18.
4 Submissions and Results
Participants uploaded the results through the shared
task website, and the official evaluation was per-
formed centrally. Feedback was provided if any for-
mal problems were encountered (for a list of checks,
see the previous section). One submission had to
be rejected because only English results were pro-
vided. After the evaluation period had passed, the
results were anonymized and published on the web.
A total of 20 systems participated in the closed
challenge; 13 of them in the Joint task and seven in
the SRL-only task. Two systems participated in the
open challenge (Joint task). Moreover, 17 systems
provided output in the out-of-domain part of the task
(11 in the OOD Joint task and six in the OOD SRL-
only task).
The main results for the core task - the Joint task
(dependency syntax and semantic relations) in the
context of the closed challenge - are summarized and
ranked in Table 5.
The largest number of systems can be compared
in the SRL results table (Table 6), where all the sys-
tems have been evaluated solely on the SRL perfor-
mance regardless whether they participated in the
Joint or SRL-only task. However, since the results
might have been influenced by the supplied parser,
separate ranking is provided for both types of the
systems.
Additional breakdown of the results (open chal-
lenge, precision and recall tables for the semantic
labeling task, etc.) are available from the CoNLL-
2009 Shared Task website19.

Table 6: Official results of the semantic labeling, closed challenge, all systems. Teams are denoted by the last name
(first name added only where needed) of the author who registered for the evaluation data. Results are sorted in
descending order of the semantic labeled F1 score (closed challenge). Bold numbers denote the best result for a given
language. Separate ranking is provided for SRL-only systems.
The second column of the table highlights the over-
all architectures. We used + to indicate that the
components are sequentially connected. The lack of
a + sign indicates that the corresponding tasks are
performed jointly.
It is perhaps not surprising that most of the obser-
vations from the 2008 shared task still hold; namely,
the best systems overall do not use joint learning or
optimization (the best such system was placed third
in the Joint task, and there were only four systems
where the learning methodology can be considered
?joint?).
Therefore, most of the observations and conclu-
sions from 2008 shared task hold as well for the
current results. For details, we will leave it to the
reader to interpret the architectures and methods

6 Conclusion
This year?s task has been demanding in several re-
spects, but certainly the most difficulty came from
the fact that participants had to tackle all seven lan-
guages. It is encouraging that despite this added af-
fort the number of participating systems has been
almost the same as last year (20 vs. 22 in 2008).
There are several positive outcomes from this
year?s enterprise:
? we have prepared a unified format and data for
several very different lanaguages, as a basis
for possible extensions towards other languages
and unified treatment of syntactic depenndecies
and semantic role labeling across natural lan-
guages;
? 20 participants have produced SRL results for
all seven languages, using several different
methods, giving hope for a combined system
with even substantially better performance;
? initial results have been provided for three lan-
guages on out-of-domain data (being in fact
quite close to the in-domain results).
Only four systems tried to apply what can be de-
scribed as joint learning for the syntactic and seman-
tic parts of the task. (Morante et al, 2009) use a true
joint learning formulation that phrases syntactico-
semantic parsing as a series of classification where
the class labels are concatenations of syntactic and
semantic edge labels. They predict (a), the set of
syntactico-semantic edge labels for each pair of to-
kens; (b), the set of incoming syntactico-semantic
edge labels for each individual token; and (c), the
existence of an edge between each pair of tokens.
Subsequently, they combine the (possibly conflict-
ing) output of the three classifiers by a ranking ap-
proach to determine the most likely structure that
meets all well-formedness constraints. (Llu??s et al,
2009) present a joint approach based on an exten-
sion of Eisner?s parser to accommodate also seman-
tic dependency labels. This architecture is similar
to the one presented by the same authors in the past
edition, with the extension to a second-order syn-
tactic parsing and a particular setting for Catalan
and Spanish. (Gesmundo et al, 2009) use an in-
cremental parsing model with synchronous syntac-
tic and semantic derivations and a joint probability
model for syntactic and semantic dependency struc-
tures. The system uses a single input queue but two
separate stacks and synchronizes syntactic and se-
mantic derivations at every word. The synchronous
derivations are modeled with an Incremental Sig-
moid Belief Network that has latent variables for
both syntactic and semantic states and connections
from syntax to semantics and vice versa. (Dai et
al., 2009) designed an iterative system to exploit
the inter-connections between the different subtasks
of the CoNLL shared task. The idea is to decom-
pose the joint learning problem into four subtasks
? syntactic dependency identification, syntactic de-
pendency labeling, semantic dependency identifica-
tion and semantic dependency labeling. The initial
step is to use a pipeline approach to use the input of
one subtask as input to the next, in the order speci-
fied. The iterative steps then use additional features
that are not available in the initial step to improve the
accuracy of the overall system. For example, in the
iterative steps, semantic information becomes avail-
able as features to syntactic parsing, so on and so
forth.
Despite these results, it is still not clear whether
joint learning has a significant advantage over other
approaches (and if yes, then for what languages). It
is thus necessary to carefully plan the next shared
tasks; it might be advantageous to bring up a sim-
ilar task in the future once again, and/or couple it
with selected application(s). There, (we hope) the
benefits of the dependency representation combined
with semantic roles the way we have formulated it
in 2008 and 2009 will really show up.
Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the Linguistic Data Consor-
tium, mainly to Denise DiPersio, Tony Casteletto
and Christopher Cieri for their help and handling
of invoicing and distribution of the data for which
LDC has a license. For all of the trial, training and
evaluation data they had to act a very short notice.
All the data has been at the participants? disposal
(again) free of charge. We are grateful to all of them
for LDC?s continuing support of the CoNLL Shared
16
Tasks.
We would also like to thank organizers of the pre-
vious four shared tasks: Sabine Buchholz, Xavier
Carreras, Ryan McDonald, Amit Dubey, Johan Hall,
Yuval Krymolowski, Sandra Ku?bler, Erwin Marsi,
Jens Nilsson, Sebastian Riedel and Deniz Yuret.
This shared task would not have been possible with-
out their previous effort.
We also acknowledge the support of the M?SMT
of the Czech Republic, projects MSM0021620838
and LC536; the Grant Agency of the Academy of
sciences of the Czech Republic 1ET201120505 (for
Jan Hajic?, Jan ?Ste?pa?nek and Pavel Stran?a?k).
Llu??s Ma`rquez and M. Anto`nia Mart?? partici-
pation was supported by the Spanish Ministry of
Education and Science, through the OpenMT and
TextMess research projects (TIN2006-15307-C03-
02, TIN2006-15265-C06-06).
The following individuals directly contributed to
the Chinese Treebank (in alphabetic order): Meiyu
