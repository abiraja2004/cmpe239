This paper proposes a method by which 5WlH (who, 
when, where, what, why, how, and predicate) infor- 
mation is used to classify and navigate Japanese- 
language texts. 5WlH information, extracted from 
text data, has an access platform with three func- 
tions: episodic retrieval, multi-dimensional classi- 
fication, and overall classification. In a six-month 
trial, the platform was used by 50 people to access 
6400 newspaper articles. The three functions proved 
to be effective for office documentation work and the 
precision of extraction was approximately 82%. 
1 In t roduct ion  
In recent years, we have seen an explosive growth 
in the volume of information available through on- 
line networks and from large capacity storage de- 
vices. High-speed and large-scale retrieval tech- 
niques have made it possible to receive information 
through information services such as news clipping 
and keyword-based retrieval. However, information 
retrieval is not a purpose in itself, but a means in 
most cases. In office work, users use retrieval ser- 
vices to create various documents such as proposals 
and reports. 
Conventional retrieval services do not provide 
users with a good access platform to help them 
achieve their practical purposes (Sakamoto, 1997; 
Lesk et al, 1997). They have to repeat retrieval 
operations and classify the data for themselves. 
To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes 
a method by which 5WlH (who, when, where, 
what, why, how, and predicate) information can 
be used to classify and navigate Japanese-language 
texts. 5WlH information provides users with easy- 
to-understand classification axes and retrieval keys 
because it has a set of fundamental elements needed 
to describe vents. 
In this paper, we discuss common information 
retrieval requirements for office work and describe 
the three functions that our access platform us- 
ing 5WlH information provides: episodic retrieval, 
multi-dimensional classification, and overall classifi- 
cation. We then discuss 5WlH extraction methods, 
and, finally, we report on the results of a six-month 
trial in which 50 people, linked to a company in- 
tranet, used the platform to access newspaper arti- 
cles. 
2 Ret r ieva l  Requ i rements  In  an  
Off ice 
Information retrieval is an extremely important part 
of office work, and particularly crucial in the creation 
of office documents. The retrieval requirements in 
office work can be classified into three types. 
Episodic viewpoint: We are often required to 
make an episode, temporal transition data on a cer- 
tain event. For example, "Company X succeeded 
in developing a two-gigabyte memory" makes the 
user want to investigate what kind of events were 
announced about Company X's memory before this 
event. The user has to collect the related events 
and then arrange them in temporal order to make 
an episode. 
Comparat ive viewpoint: The comparative view- 
point is familiar to office workers. For example, 
when the user fills out a purchase request form to 
buy a product, he has to collect comparative infor- 
mation on price, performance and so on, from several 
companies. Here, the retrieval is done by changing 
retrieval viewpoints. 
Overall viewpoint: An overall viewpoint is neces- 
sary when there is a large amount of classification 
data. When a user produces a technical analysis re- 
port after collecting electronics-related articles from 
a newspaper over one year, the amount of data is 
too large to allow global tendencies tobe interpreted 
such as when the events occurred, what kind of com- 
panies were involved, and what type of action was 
required. Here, users have to repeat retrieval and 
classification by choosing appropriate keywords to 
condense classification so that it is not too broad- 
ranging to understand.

Navigat ion 
Conventional keyword-based retrieval does not con- 
sider logical relationships between keywords. For ex- 
ample, the condition, "NEC & semiconductor & pro- 
duce" retrieves an article containing "NEC formed 
a technical alliance with B company, and B com- 
pany produced semiconductor X." Mine et al and 
Satoh et al reported that this problem leads to re- 
trieval noise and unnecessary results (Mine et al, 
1997; Satoh and Muraki, 1993). This problem makes 
it difficult to meet the requirements of an office be- 
cause it produces retrieval noise in these three types 
of operations. 
5WlH information is who, when, where, what, 
why, how, and predicate information extracted from 
text data through the 5WlH extraction module us- 
ing language dictionary and sentence analysis tech- 
niques. 5WlH extraction modules assign 5WlH in- 
dexes to the text data. The indexes are stored in list 
form of predicates and arguments (when, who, what, 
why, where, how) (Lesk et ai., 1997). The 5WlH 
index can suppress retrieval noise because the in- 
dex considers the logical relationships between key- 
words. For example, the 5WlH index makes it pos- 
sible to retrieve texts using the retrieval condition 
"who: NEC & what: semiconductor & predicate: 
produce." It can filter out the article containing 
"NEC formed a technical alliance with B company, 
and B company produced semiconductor X." 
Based on 5WlH information, we propose a 5WlH 
classification and navigation model which can meet 
office retrieval requirements. The model has three 
functions: episodic retrieval, multi-dimensional clas- 
sification, and overall classification (Figure 1). 
3.1 Episodic Ret r ieva l  
The 5WlH index can easily do episodic retrieval 
by choosing a set of related events and arranging

the events in temporal order. The results are read- 
able by users as a kind of episode. For example, 
an NEC semiconductor p oduction episode is made 
by retrieving texts containing "who: NEC & what: 
semiconductor & predicate: product" indexes and 
sorting the retrieved texts in temporal order (Figure 
2). 
The 5WlH index can suppress retrieval noise by 
conventional keyword-based retrieval such as "NEC 
& semiconductor & produce." Also, the result is an 
easily readable series of events which is able to meet 
episodic viewpoint requirements in office retrieval. 
3.2  Mu l t i -d imens iona l  C lass i f i ca t ion  
The 5WlH index has seven-dimensionai axes for 
classification. Texts are classified into categories on 
the basis of whether they contain a certain combi- 
nation of 5WlH elements or not. Though 5WlH 
elements create seven-dimensional space, users are 
provided with a two-dimensional matrix because this 
makes it easier for them to understand text distri- 
bution. Users can choose a fundamental viewpoint 
from 5WlH elements to be the vertical axis. The 
other elements are arranged on the horizontal axis 
as the left matrix of Figure 3 shows. Classification 
makes it possible to access data from a user's com- 
parative viewpoints by combining 5WlH elements. 
For example, the cell specified by NEC and PC 
shows the number of articles containing NEC as a 
"who" element and PC as a "what" element. 
Users can easily obtain comparable data by 
switching their fundamental viewpoint from the

"who" viewpoint o the "what" viewpoint, for ex- 
ample, as the right matrix of Figure 3 shows. This 
meets comparative viewpoint requirements in office 
retrieval. 
3.3 Overall Classif ication 
When there are a large number of 5WlH elements, 
the classification matrix can be packed by using a 
thesaurus. As 5WlH elements axe represented by 
upper concepts in the thesaurus, the matrix can be 
condensed. Figure 4 has an example with six "who" 
elements which are represented by two categories. 
The matrix provides users with overall classification 
as well as detailed sub-classification through the se- 
lection of appropriate hierarchical levels. This meets 
overall classification requirements in office retrieval. 
4 5W1H In format ion  Ext rac t ion  
5W1H extraction was done by a case-based shal- 
low parsing (CBSP) model based on the algorithm 
used in the VENIEX, Japanese information extrac- 
tion system (Muraki et al, 1993). CBSP is a robust 
and effective method of analysis which uses lexical 
information, expression patterns and case-markers 
in sentences. Figure 5 shows the detail on the algo- 
rithm for CBSP. 
In this algorithm, input sentences are first seg- 
mented into words by Japanese morphological nal- 
ysis (Japanese sentences have no blanks between 
words.) Lexical information is linked to each word 
such as the part-of-speech, root forms and semantic 
categories. 
Next, 5WlH elements are extracted by proper 
noun extraction, pattern expression matching and 
case-maker matching. 
In the proper noun extraction phase, a 60 050- 
word proper noun dictionary made it possible to 
indicate people's names and organization names as 
"who" elements and place names as "where" ele- 
ments. For example, NEC and China are respec- 
tively extracted as a "who" element and a "where" 
procedure CBSP; 
begin 
Apply morphological nalysis to the sentence; 
foreach word in the sentence do begin 
if the word is a people's name or 
an organization name then

push it to the stack; 
else if the word is a place name then 
Mark the word as a "where" element and 
push it to the stack; 
else if the word matches an organization 
name pattern then 
Mark the word as a "who" element and 
push it to the stack; 
else if the word matches a date pattern then 
Mark the word as a "when" element and 
push it to the stack; 
else if the word is a noun then 
if the next word is ?~? or t2 then 
Mark the word and the kept unspecified 
elements as "who" elements and 
push them to the stack; 
if the next word is ~: or ~= then 
Mark the word and the kept unspecified 
elements as "what" elements and 
push them to the stack; 
else 
Keep the word as an unspecified element; 
else if the word is a verb then begin 
Fix the word as the predicate lement of 
a 5WlH set; 
repeat 
Pop one marked word from the stack; 
if the 5WlH element 
corresponding to the mark 
of the word is not fixed then  
Fix the word as the 5WlH element 
corresponding to its mark; 
else 
break repeat; 
unti l  stack is empty; 
end 
end

In the pattern expression matching phase, the sys- 
tem extracts words matching predefined patterns as 
"who" and "when" elements. There are several typ-

ical patterns for organization ames and people's 
names, dates, and places (Muraki et al, 1993). For 
example, nouns followed by ~J :  (Co., Inc. Ltd.) and 
~-~ (Univ.) mean they are organizations and "who" 
elements. For example, 1998 ~ 4 J~ 18 ~ (April 18, 
1998) can be identified as a date. "When" elements 
can be recognized by focusing on the pattern for 
(year),)~ (month), and ~ (day). 
For words which are not extracted as 5WlH el- 
ements in previous phases, the system decides its 
5WlH index by case marker matching. The system 
checks the relationships between Japanese particles 
(case markers) and verbs and assigns a 5W1H in- 
dex to each word according to rules such as 7~  is a 
marker of a "who" element and ~ is a marker of a 
"what" element. In the example "A } J :7~ X ~r 
~ (Company A sells product X.)," company A is 
identified as a "who" element according to the case 
marker 7) ~ if it is not specified as a "who" element 
by proper noun extraction and pattern expression 
matching. 
5WlH elements followed by a verb (predicate) are 
fixed as a 5WlH set so that a 5WlH set does not 
include two elements for the same 5WlH index. A 
5WlH element belongs to the same 5W1H set as the 
nearest predicate after it.

5WlH information classification and navigation 
works in the information access platform. The plat- 
form disseminates u ers with newspaper information 
through the company intranet. The platform struc- 
ture is shown in Figure 6. 
Web robots collect newspaper articles from spec- 
ified URLs every day. The data is stored in the 
database, and a 5WlH index data is made for the 
data. Currently, 6398 news articles are stored in the 
databases. Some articles are disseminated to users 
according to their profiles. Users can browse all the 
data through WWW browsers and use 5WlH classi- 
fication and navigation functions by typing sentences 
or specifying regions in the browsing texts.

5.1 5W1H Information Extract ion 
"When," "who, .... what," and "predicate" informa- 
tion has been extracted from 6398 electronics in- 
dustry news articles since August, 1996. We have 
evaluated extracted information for 6398 news head- 
lines. The headline average length is approximately 
12 words. Table 1 shows the result of evaluating 
"who," "what," and "predicate" information and 
overall extracted information. 
In this table, the results are classified with re- 
gard to the presence of corresponding elements in the 
news headlines. More than 90% of "who," "what," 
and "predicate" elements can correctly be extracted 
with our extraction algorithm from headlines having 
such elements. On the other hand, the algorithm 
is not highly precise when there is no correspond- 
ing element in the article. The errors are caused 
by picking up other elements despite the absence 
of the element o be extracted. However, the er- 
rors hardly affect applications such as episodic re-

trieval and multi-dimensional classification because 
they only add unnecessary information and do not 
remove necessary information. 
The precision independent of the presence of the 
element is from 85% to 95% for each, and the overall 
precision is 82.4%. 
5.1.1 Episodic Retrieval 
Figure 7 is an actual screen of Figure 2, which shows 
an example of episodic retrieval based on headline 
news saying, "NEC ~)~-~?)~: :~: J :  0 18%~ 
(NEC produces 18% more semiconductors han ex- 
pected.)" The user specifies the region, "NEC ~)? 
~ i~k?)~i~ (NEC produces semiconductors)" n 
the headline for episodic retrieval. A "who" element 
NEC, a "what" element ~ i~$ (semiconductor), and 
a "predicate" element ~ (produce) are episodic re- 
trieval keys. The extracted results are NEC's semi- 
conductor production story. 
The upper frame of the window lists a set of head- 
lines arranged in temporal order. In each article, 
NEC is a "who" element, the semiconductor is a 
"what" element and production is a "predicate" el- 
ement. By tracing episodic headlines, the user can 
find that the semiconductor market was not good at 
the end of 1996 but that it began turning around 
in 1997. The lower frame shows an article corre- 
sponding to the headline in the upper frame. When 
the user clicks the 96/10/21 headline, the complete 
article is displayed in the lower frame.

frame of Figure 8, the user can switch the funda- 
mental axis from "who" to "what" (Figure 9, up- 
per frame). By switching the fundamental xis, the 
user can easily see classification from different view- 
points. On clicking the cell for "what": ~{P .  (en- 
code) and "predicate": ~2~ (develop), the user finds 
eight headlines (Figure 9, lower frame). The user 
can then see different company activities uch as the 
97/04/07 headline; "C ~i ~ o  fzf f ' -  ~' ~ .~ 
~f~g@~:  ~ (C Company has developed ata 
transmission encoding technology using a satellite)," 
shown in the lower frame of Figure 9. 
In this way, a user can classify article headlines by 
switching 5WlH viewpoints. 
5.1.3 Overall Classification 
Overall classification is condensed by using an orga- 
nization and a technical thesaurus. The organization 
thesaurus has three layers and 2800 items, and the 
technical thesaurus has two layers and 1000 techni- 
cal terms. "Who" and "what" elements are respec- 
tively represented by the upper classes of the orga- 
nization thesaurus and the technical thesaurus. The 
upper classes are vertical and horizontal elements in 
the multi-dimensional classification matrix. "Pred- 
icate" elements are categorized by several frequent 
predicates based on the user's priorities. 
Figure 10 shows the results of overall classifica- 
tion for 250 articles disseminated in April, 1997. 
Here, "who" elements on the vertical axis are rep- 
resented by industry categories instead of company 
names, and "what" elements on the horizontal axis 
are represented by technical fields instead of tech- 
nical terms. On clicking the second cell from the 
top of the "who" elements, ~]~J t~ (electrical and 
mechanical) in Figure 10, the user can view subcat- 
egorized classification on electrical and mechanical 
industries as indicated in Figure 11. Here, ~ :  
(electrical and mechanical) is expanded to the sub- 
categories; ~ J ~  (general electric) ~_~ (power 
electric), ~ I ~  (home electric), ~.{~j~ (commu- 
nication), and so on. 
6 Cur rent  S ta tus  
The information access platform was exploited dur- 
ing the MIIDAS (Multiple Indexed Information Dis- 
semination and Acquisition Service) project which 
NEC used internally (Okumura et al, 1997). The 
DEC Alpha workstation (300 MHz) is a server ma- 
chine providing 5WlH classification and navigation 
functions for 50 users through WWW browsers. 
User interaction occurs through CGI and JAVA pro- 
grams. 
After a six-month trial by 50 users, four areas for 
improvement become vident. 
1) 5WlH extraction: 5WlH extraction precision was 
approximately 82% for newspaper headlines. The 
extraction algorithm should be improved so that it 
can deal with embedded sentences and compound 
sentences. 
Also, dictionaries should be improved in order to be 
able to deal with different domains uch as patent 
data and academic papers. 
2) Episodic retrieval: The interface should be im- 
proved so that the user can switch retrieval from 
episodic to normal retrieval in order to compare re- 
trieval data. 
Episodic retrieval is based on the temporal sorting 
of a set of related events. At present, geographic ar- 
rangement is expected to become a branch function 
for episodic retrieval. It is possible to arrange ach 
event on a map by using 5WlH index data. This 
would enable users to trace moving events uch as 
the onset of a typhoon or the escape of a criminal. 
3) Multi-dimensional classification: Some users need 
to edit the matrix for themselves on the screen. 
576 
Moreover, it is necessary to insert new keywords and 
delete unnecessary keywords. 
7 Related Work 
SOM (Self-Organization Map) is an effective auto- 
matic classification method for any data represented 
by vectors (Kohonen, 1990). However, the meaning 
of each cluster is difficult to understand intuitively. 
The clusters have no logical meaning because they 
depend on a keyword set based on the frequency that 
keywords occur. 
Scatter/Gather is clustering information based on 
user interaction (Hearst and Pederson, 1995; Hearst 
et al, 1995). Initial cluster sets are based on key- 
word frequencies. 
GALOIS/ULYSSES is a lattice-based classifica- 
tion system and the user can browse information on 
the lattice produced by the existence of keywords 
(Carpineto and Romano, 1995). 
5WlH classification and navigation is unique in 
that it is based on keyword functions, not on the 
existence of keywords. 
Lifestream manages e-mail by focusing on tempo- 
ral viewpoints (Freeman and Fertig, 1995). In this 
sense, this idea is similar to our episodic retrieval 
though the purpose and target are different. 
Mine et al and Hyodo and Ikeda reported on the 
effectiveness of using dependency relations between 
keywords for retrieval (Mine et al, 1997; Hyodo and 
Ikeda, 1994). 
As the 5WlH index is more informative than sim- 
ple word dependency, it is possible to create more 
functions. More informative indexing such as se- 
mantic indexing and conceptual indexing can the- 
oretically provide more sophisticated classification. 
However, this indexing is not always successful for 
practical use because of semantic analysis difficul- 
ties. Consequently 5WlH is the most appropriate 
indexing method from the practical viewpoint. 
8 Conclusion 
This paper proposed a method by which 5WlH 
(who, when, where, what, why, how, and predi- 
cate) information is used to classify and navigate 
Japanese-language t xts. 5WlH information, ex- 
tracted from text data, provides an access plat- 
form with three functions: episodic retrieval, multi- 
dimensional classification, and overall classification. 
In a six-month trial, the platform was used by 50 
people to access 6400 newspaper articles. 
The three functions proved to be effective for of- 
fice documentation work and the extraction preci- 
sion was approximately 82%. 
We intend to make a more quantitative evaluation 
by surveying more users about the functions. We 
also plan to improve the 5W1H extraction algorithm, 
dictionaries and the user interface.
