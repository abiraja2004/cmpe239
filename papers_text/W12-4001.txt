Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel human com-
putation game for sentiment analysis. Our
game aims at annotating sentiments of a col-
lection of text documents and simultaneously
constructing a highly discriminative lexicon of
positive and negative phrases.
Human computation games have been widely
used in recent years to acquire human knowl-
edge and use it to solve problems which are
infeasible to solve by machine intelligence.
We package the problems of lexicon construc-
tion and sentiment detection as a single hu-
man computation game. We compare the re-
sults obtained by the game with that of other
well-known sentiment detection approaches.
Obtained results are promising and show im-
provements over traditional approaches.
1 Introduction
We propose a novel solution for the analysis of sen-
timent expressed in text media. Novel corpus based
and lexicon based sentiment analysis methods are
created each year. The continual emergence of con-
ceptually similar methods for this known problem
shows that a satisfactory solution has still not been
found. We believe that the lack of suitable labelled
data that could be used in machine learning tech-
niques to train sentiment classifiers is one of the ma-
jor reasons the field of sentiment analysis is not ad-
vancing more rapidly.
Recognizing that knowledge for understanding
sentiment is common sense and does not require ex-
perts, we plan to take a new approach where labelled
data is obtained from people using human computa-
tion platforms and games. We also prove that the
method can provide not only labelled texts, but peo-
ple also help by selecting sentiment-expressing fea-
tures that can generalize well.
Human computation is a newly emerging
paradigm. It tries to solve large-scale problems by
utilizing human knowledge and has proven useful
in solving various problems (Von Ahn and Dabbish,
2004; Von Ahn, 2006; Von Ahn et al, 2006a).
To obtain high quality solution from human com-
putation, people should be motivated to make their
best effort. One way to incentivize people for sub-
mitting high-quality results is to package the prob-
lem at hand as a game and request people to play
it. This process is called gamification. The game
design should be such that the solution to the main
problems can be formed by appropriately aggregat-
ing results of played games.
In this work, we propose a cooperative human
computation game for sentiment analysis called
Guesstiment. It aims at annotating sentiment of
a collection of text documents, and simultaneously
constructing a lexicon of highly polarized (positive
and negative) words which can further be used for
sentiment detection tasks. By playing a collabora-
tive game, people rate hotel reviews as positive and
negative and select words and phrases within the re-
views that best express the chosen polarity.
We compare these annotations with those ob-
tained during a former crowd-sourcing survey and
prove that packaging the problem as a game can im-
prove the quality of the responses. We also com-
pare our approach with the state-of-the-art machine
1
learning techniques and prove the superiority of hu-
man cognition for this task. In a third experiment
we use the same annotations in a multi faceted opin-
ion classification problem and find that results are
superior to those obtained using known linguistic re-
sources.
In (section 2) we review the literature related to
our work. We then outline the game and its rules
(section 3). We compare the Guesstiment results
to the state-of-the-art machine learning, standard
crowd-sourcing methods and sentiment dictionar-
ies(section 4) and conclude the paper with ideas for
future work (section 5).
2 Related Work
In this section we review the important literature re-
lated and similar to our work. Sine we propose a
human computation approach for sentiment analy-
sis, we start by reviewing the literature on human
computation and the closely related field of crowd-
sourcing. Then we move on by having a brief look
on the human computation and knowledge acquisi-
tion games proposed so far by the researchers. Fi-
nally, we briefly review major sentiment analysis
methods utilized by the researchers.
2.1 Human Computation and Crowd-Sourcing
The literature on human computation is highly over-
lapping with that of crowd-sourcing, as they are
closely connected. The two terms are sometimes
used interchangeably although they are slightly dif-
ferent. Crowd-sourcing in its broadest form, ?is the
act of taking a job traditionally performed by a des-
ignated agent (usually an employee) and outsourc-
ing it to an undefined, generally large group of peo-
ple in the form of an open call?(Quinn and Bederson,
2011; Howe, 2006). Since the first use of the word
crowd-sourcing by J. Howe (Howe, 2006), there has
been a lot of interest in this field due to the wide ac-
cessibility of anonymous crowd workers across the
web.
The work described in (Rumshisky, 2011) uses
crowd-sourcing to perform word sense disambigua-
tion on a corpus. In (Vondrick et al, 2010), crowd-
sourcing is used for video annotation. Moreover,
(Christophe et al, 2010) has used crowd-sourcing
for satellite image analysis.
(Settles, 2011a) is another approach which aims
at combining active learning with crowd-sourcing
for text classification. The principal contribution of
their work is that as well as document annotation,
they use human computation also to perform fea-
ture selection. (Law et al, ) is another recent work
which proposes a game for acquisition of attribute-
value pairs from images.
2.2 Human Computation Games
Luis Von Ahn, the pioneer of the field of human
computation, designed a game to encourage play-
ers to semantically annotate a large corpus of images
(Von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004). It was the first human
computation game.
Following Von Ahn?s work, more researchers
were encouraged to package computational prob-
lems as joyful games and have a group of non-
expert users play them (Von Ahn, 2006). Verbosity
(Von Ahn et al, 2006a) was designed with the goal
of gathering common sense knowledge about words.
KissKissBan (Ho et al, 2009) was another game for
image annotation.
Peekaboom(Von Ahn et al, 2006b) aimed at im-
age segmentation and ?Phrase Detectives? (Cham-
berlain et al, 2008) was used to help constructing an
anamorphic corpus for NLP tasks. Another human
computation game is described in (Riek et al, 2011)
whose purpose is semantic annotation of video data.
2.3 Sentiment Analysis
The field of sentiment analysis and classification
currently mostly deals with extracting sentiment
from text data. Various methods (Turney, 2002;
Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Taboada et al, 2011;
Pang et al, 2002) have been proposed for effec-
tive and efficient sentiment extraction of large col-
lections of text documents.
Sentiment classification methods are usually di-
vided into two main categories: Lexicon based tech-
niques and methods based on machine learning. In
lexicon-based methods, a rich lexicon of polarized
words is used to find key sentences and phrases in
text documents which can be used to describe senti-
ment of the whole text (Taboada et al, 2011). Ma-
chine learning methods, on the other hand, treat the
sentiment detection problem as a text classification
task (Pang et al, 2002).
2
Most of the research has been oriented towards
finding the overall polarity of whole documents. The
problem was broken down even more by using of
the faceted opinion concept (Liu, 2010). The goal of
this attempt was to determine precisely what aspects
of the concepts the expressed opinions should be
linked to. We will use this distinction to assess our
method?s viability in both overall and multi faceted
opinion analysis.
The work in (Brew et al, 2010) is an attempt to
use crowd-sourcing for sentiment analysis. The au-
thors use a crowd of volunteers for the analysis of
sentiments of economical news items. Users provide
annotations which are then used to learn a classifier
to discriminate positive articles from negatives. It
uses active learning to select a diverse set of arti-
cles for annotations so that a generalizable, precise
classifier can be learned from annotated data. The
work in (Zhou et al, 2010) is another approach to
use active learning to improve sentiment classifica-
tion. It uses a deep network to learn a sentiment
classifier in a semi-supervised manner. Moreover,
this method uses active learning to learn from unla-
beled data which are the most informative samples
that need to be labeled.
Two more recent works that have focused on sen-
timent classification by designing human compu-
tation games are (Weichselbraun et al, 2011) and
(Al-Subaihin et al, 2011). In (Weichselbraun et
al., 2011) the game ?Sentiment Quiz? has been pro-
posed that aims at finding the degree of polarity of
words in a lexicon. In each round of the game, the
player is asked to vote about polarity of a given
words from most negative to most positive. The
player is score based on the agreement between his
vote and the votes of previous players. ?Sentiment
Quiz? demands annotation in the word level and
therefore can only be used to construct a sentiment
lexicon.
Another work which aims at sentiment classifica-
tion is (Al-Subaihin et al, 2011). In this work, a
multi-player game is proposed which aims at find-
ing the sentiment of individual sentences. The game
is played by three groups of two players each. Each
team is shown a sentence and its members are asked
to highlight the sentiment carrying terms of the sen-
tence separately and quickly. The first team whose
players? votes match wins and the current game
round finishes. The game continues by introducing
different sentences to the teams and hence gathers
information about polarity of terms and their corre-
sponding context.
3 The Proposed Game
In this section we propose a novel human compu-
tation game called Guesstiment. We use the infor-
mation provided while playing this game to obtain a
reliable dataset of sentiment annotated data as well
as a lexicon of highly polarized positive and negative
words.
Having two by-products as the result of playing
instead of merely trying to obtain document annota-
tions is the most important contribution of Guessti-
ment. The idea of using crowd-sourcing for feature
extraction has already been used in (Settles, 2011b),
but not as a human computation game. In the rest of
the following section, we will discuss the game play
and rules of Guesstiment.
3.1 Rules of Guesstiment
Guesstiment is a two-player asynchronous game. It
aims at annotating a large corpus of text documents,
similar to the goal of the ESP game in (Von Ahn
and Dabbish, 2004) for images. However, Guessti-
ment does this in a different way because of its
rules and asynchronous approach. The differences
allow Guesstiment to obtain more useful informa-
tion from played game rounds than ESP does, since
each player contributes in providing a different type
of information.
The two players of the game are called ?Sug-
gester? and ?Guesser?. These roles are initialized
randomly and interchanged between the two players
after each round of the game.
The Suggester, who starts each round will be
given the whole text of a review document and
he/she is supposed to:
1. Decide whether the whole text is positive or
negative, i.e. the author is praising about a sub-
ject or criticising it.
2. Select a single word (or a sequence of words,
as short as possible) which best describes the
polarity (positive or negative) he has selected
in part (1). For example, when the negative po-
larity is chosen, the word ?terrible? would be
3
a good choice for the representative word (pro-
vided that it is present in the text).
The Guesser, on the other hand, will be given
only the word (or word sequence) suggested by the
Suggester (he won?t see the whole text) and he has
to guess polarity of the whole text just based on
that single word. If the polarities suggested by the
two players agree, they are both given some posi-
tive score (based on factors described below) oth-
erwise 0. Then the roles are interchanged and the
game continues with a new document. The guesser
can also refuse to make a guess about polarity of the
text (when for example the suggested word is am-
biguous or not very discriminative) in which case
the suggester has two more opportunities to suggest
another word from the text.
Guesstiment is a cooperative game. It means that
the two players are not opponent and they both re-
ceive equal score after each round (Not high score
for one player and low score for the other). There-
fore, the Suggester should make his best efforts to
select the most polarized word from the test which
best describes the selected sentiment or polarity. The
UI screens for Suggester and Guesser are depicted in
figures 1a and 1b respectively.
3.1.1 Scoring
The score of each suggested word (or word se-
quence) depends on a variety of factors, includ-
ing the length of the sequence and its novelty, i.e.
how many times it has already been selected by
other players. Suppose that the word sequence w
is present in the current text document and also it
has been present in text documents of nw of previ-
ously played game rounds. Assuming w has been
selected kw time before current game round, the po-
tential score of w, PSw is defined as:
PSw =
[
1
length(w)? kwnw
]
(1)
In (1), length(w) is the length (number of words)
of phrase w. Using this scoring strategy, players are
encouraged to select as shortest phrases as possible.
Single words that are not already selected by other
players will yield the highest score.
Moreover, some words are not allowed as sug-
gestions and will yield zero score regardless of the
agreement in polarity judgments. They are selected
by putting a threshold on the potential score of
words and placing those with a score lower than the
threshold on the forbidden list. These words are col-
ored red in the text and are separately displayed in
the forbidden list.
The cooperation between the Suggester and the
Guesser requires an agreement between them. This
allows the game to collect precise annotations and
simultaneously build a good quality lexicon of
words which are most important in detecting polar-
ity of the text.
The total score of each player is displayed on
the scoreboard at the bottom of the Suggest/Guess
graphical user interface. The potential score of a
word is also displayed while typing which allows
users to avoid selecting words with low score.
4 Experiments
4.1 Implementation Details
The game was implemented as a traditional three-
tier web application. For data storage, we used the
H2 embedded database which has proven to be fast
enough for scientific information retrieval applica-
tions. For the server side of the application we used
the Play! framework, which is a lightweight easy
to use framework for Java MVC web application
framework.
The client side is a Java Applet. We used a service
oriented approach to define interactions between the
client and the server so that the game play is de-
fined as a sequence of HTTP requests between client
and server. Using this approach,, client and server
are maximally separate and therefore various client
applications can be written, for instance to run on
smart phones.
4.2 Experimentation Environment
A total of 80000 review texts were extracted along
with their corresponding ratings from the TripAdvi-
sor website 1. Among these, 1000 articles were ran-
domly selected and inserted in the game database
to be used in game rounds. More than 20 players
played the game over the course of one month and
697 annotations were collected during this period,

of which 312 are distinct. The players were volun-
teer students who played the game after an initial
advertisement in Facebook. Almost all of them were
non-native English speakers, both graduate and un-
dergraduate.
For selecting articles for each round, a combina-
tion of strategies were used. From the set of docu-
ments which have not already been labelled by any
of the players, we select the article with the least
difference between number of positive and negative
(as collected in the lexicon constructed so far) words
so that we get the most information from annota-
tions. If all document have been annotated at least
two times, we make the selection among documents
for which the two annotations disagree, so that we
solve disagreements by majority vote.
4.3 Quality of Annotations
For each review text in the TripAdvisor website,
there is a corresponding rating score given by the
very writer of the text. These ratings, score the qual-
ity of services of the mentioned hotel from the point
of view of the review writer.They give a score of 1
(most negative) to 5 (most positive) to the described
hotel which is presumably correlated with the inher-
ent sentiment of the review text written by the same
author for the same hotel.
We used these review ratings as the ground truth
to assess the quality of player annotations. We con-
sidered review ratings higher than 3 as having posi-
tive sentiment and those with rating lower than 3 as
having negative sentiment. Review with rating equal
to 3 were considered neutral and excluded from fur-
ther experiments. Let Ratei be the numerical rating
of document i, according to the above criteria, we
accept document i if and only if:
Ratei ? {1, 2, 4, 5} (2)
As well as annotations provided by players of the
game, we also compared the ground truth to the re-
sults of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques
adapted for sentiment analysis. We considered senti-
ment analysis as a typical binary classification prob-
lem and used a simple bag of words approach for
feature extraction.
For the learning algorithm, we used Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM) and the Na??ve Bayes meth-
ods which are two well-known learning algorithms
for text classification problems (Brew et al, 2010).
In the SVM method, document feature vectors are
transformed to high-dimensional kernel space and
then a maximum margin separating hyperplane is
sought in the new kernel space. Training of SVM
is quadratic in the amount of training data and there-
fore it is hardly feasible for large-scale problems.
The Na??ve Bayes approach is another learning
algorithm which is simpler and faster to run than
SVM. In this statistical method, feature words are
considered independent random variables and Bayes
rule is used to derive posterior probabilities of hav-
ing positive and negatives sentiment for each docu-
ment. The sentiment with maximum posterior prob-
ability is the predicted sentiment for the given docu-
ment.
Results of comparison between the ground truth
and various annotation approaches are depicted in
table 1. For the game results, we aggregated differ-
ent annotations for individual documents by major-
5
ity voting. Moreover, for the machine learning algo-
rithms we used cross-validation to adjust the param-
eters. Moreover, the results were computed by aver-
aging 10-fold cross-validation results over all folds.
Accuracy of each method is defined as:
Accuracy = NcorrectNtotal (3)
.
In equation (3), Ncorrect is the number of docu-
ment with computed sentiment equal to the ground
truth and Ntotal is the total number of documents. It
can be seen in table 1 that our method outperforms
machine learning.
4.4 Comparison with Classical
Crowd-Sourcing
We also made a comparison between our approach
and simple crowd-sourcing. For this goal, we used
the results of a survey conducted in summer 2011.
40 of the review texts were selected randomly from
the whole dataset and given to a crowd of 27 student
to be annotated based on their sentiment. Individual
annotations for each document were aggregated us-
ing majority voting. The ground truth was computed
in the same way as the previous section.
We re-executed the Guesstiment in a period of one
week using only those 40 reviews and compared the
quality of the obtained annotations to that of the sur-
vey (aggregated using majority voting). Similar to
the survey, we aggregated annotations for individual
documents by majority voting.
The results, depicted in table 2, are quite promis-
ing. Accuracy of the simple crowd-sourcing was
82.5% whereas gamification acquired an accuracy of
100%. We can see that merely packaging the prob-
lem as a game significantly improves accuracy of the
results.
We can infer from tables 1 and 2 that gamification
actually helps in obtaining good quality annotation
results. Therefore, annotations derived from play-
ers? effort are highly reliable and can be used for
further studies, discussed below.
4.5 Comparison with Sentiment Dictionary
Performance
The previous experiments proved the viability of
human computation for detecting the polarities of

whole documents. Manual classification is however
expensive, even if it takes the form of a game. We
take a step further and use the result of the game,
in the form of a sentiment dictionary, in a subse-
quent automated classification task. We compare
the Guesstiment dictionary with an established re-
source, OpinionFinder (Wilson et al, 2005) in a
multi faceted opinion classification problem.
The OpinionFinder dictionary (OF) contains 8220
entries representing tuples of English words, either
in the original form or stemmed, and their most
likely parts of speech. Each tuple has an associated
polarity which can be positive, negative or neutral.
There are 5276 words in the original form in the dic-
tionary that have a positive or negative polarity. By
contrast, the Guesstiment dictionary GS only con-
tains 312 terms, nearly 17 times less than Opinion-
Finder. Of these, 175 words are negative and 137
positive. Each of the words within the two dictio-
naries has an intrinsic polarity P (w),?w ? D =
{OF,GS}.
The opinion extraction task is topic oriented. We
extract faceted opinions (Liu, 2010) - occurrences
of sentiment that can be attached to a given topic or
class within a topic model zi ? ?, i ? {1..k} where
k is the number of independent topics. We used two
sets of topics: the first is a statistical topic model ob-
tained with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al,
2003) with k = 50 topics from which we retained
the most probable 5 words for each topic and created
sets of topic relevant terms P{zi}. The second set of
6
topic terms contains the most common 90 nouns in
all available hotel reviews, which were afterwards
manually separated into 11 classes.
Many Guesstiment dictionary words, such as
?value? and ?gentleman? bear meaning by them-
selves (i.e. are nouns) and are not useful in this anal-
ysis. However the great majority of the words are
adjectives or adverbs. This makes them useful for
faceted sentiment analysis. We only consider combi-
nations of topic words and opinion dictionary terms
and the allowed combinations are based on gram-
matical dependency chains:
w1
?
?? w2, w1 ? P{zi}, i = {1..k}, w2 ? D (4)
obtained using the Stanford parser (De Marneffe
and Manning, 2008).
This binding brings confidence to the model and
prevents the accidental misinterpretation of uni-
grams. Also, the higher granularity of the opinion
description allows clustering users based on their
preferences.
We define a construct c relevant to a topic zi
within a review r as
czi ? zi ?D
c = (w1, w2|w1 ? P{zi}, w2 ? D,w1
?
?? w2)
(5)
The polarity of the said relevant construct is given
by the orientation of the contained dictionary word:
P (c) = P (w2) (6)
The polarity P of the opinion expressed within a
review r ? R with respect to a topic zi is defined as
the sum of the polarities of constructs relevant to zi.
This allows us to assess the strength of the opinion
expressed with regard to a topic.
P : R? ? 7? R
P (r, zi) =
?
r P (czi), i = {1..k}
(7)
while the overall polarity of the review is the sum
of all topic dependent polarities
P : R 7? R
P (r) =
?k
i=1 P (r, zi)
(8)
We test whether the method assigns positive over-
all polarities to reviews which have high (4 and 5)
numeric ratings nr(r) and negative to those with low
ones (1 and 2). We compare the precision and recall
of the method using both dictionaries and both topic
sets. The dataset consists of 2881 reviews regarding
the Las Vegas Bellagio hotel. Table 3 summarizes
the results. We confine our analysis to a subset of
2594 reviews from the initial 2881 for which the nu-
meric rating is greater or smaller than 3.
We notice that the recall is consistently lower for
the frequent noun topics, which was expected be-
cause of the significantly smaller number of topic
terms. However the recall does not depend on the
chosen dictionary. This is relevant because with a
much smaller pool of dictionary terms, similar re-
sults are obtained. Precision is constant in all four
cases, which also shows that results similar to those
of OpinionFinder can be obtained with our much
smaller dictionary.
The precision and recall values in Table 3 do
not reflect the capacity of the higher grained opin-
ion analysis to extract targeted user preferences.
The overall variance of the hotel?s numeric ratings
V ar(nr(r)) shows how much the reviewers dis-
agree on the quality of the stay. Generally this
disagreement comes from the different sets of val-
ues the reviewers have. For example some consider
cleanliness the most important aspect while others
are interested in a busy nightlife.
We cluster users based on the faceted opinions
we retrieved, using the k-Means algorithm (Mac-
Queen, 1967). Each reviewer is represented by a
feature vector and each feature i within the vec-
tor is the cumulative opinion expressed by the re-
viewer with regard to topic zi. The reviews within
the same cluster j have a similar representation from
the mined opinion perspective. If the quality of the
opinion mining process is high, the numeric rat-
ings associated to the reviews within a cluster will
also be similar, thus their variance V arj(nr(r)) will
be lower than the overall variance. We study the
difference between the mean intra cluster variance
avgV arj(nr(r)) and overall variance V ar(nr(r))
7
and the results are shown in table 4 for different
numbers of clusters, using both topic models and
both dictionaries.
The results show that we succeeded in decreasing
the variance by more than 20% using the Guessti-
ment dictionary and the frequent noun topics. A
17% decrease is obtained by using the same topic
set and the OpinionFinder dictionary, while the de-
creases for the LDA topics with dictionaries are
three times lower. This proves that the dictionary
resulted from playing the Guesstiment game is bet-
ter suited for faceted opinion analysis than an estab-
lished resource like OpinionFinder.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we introduced Guesstiment, a human
computation game for simultaneous feature extrac-
tion and sentiment annotation. By conducting vari-
ous experiments, we showed that quality of the an-
notations obtained using our approach outperforms
those obtained by classic crowd-sourcing. This is an
indicator of the fact that packaging a crowd-sourcing
problem as a game can improve the quality of the
obtained results. It?s mostly because that games at-
tract more attention from people than simple ques-
tions which are common ways of crowd-sourcing.
We also showed that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art machine learning methods which il-
lustrates that human computation power is still su-
perior to machine intelligence in this problem.
The idea of the game could be further extended
by testing other more complicated scoring func-
tions which could better motivate players to submit
high quality results. Also other document selection
strategies can be created to make a better trade-off
between informativeness and interestingness, or ex-
ploration and exploitation. Moreover, a computer
player could be designed to perform active learning
on feature extraction and direct the word suggestion
process toward selecting more informative features,
hereby obtaining a more discriminative high-quality
lexicon.
