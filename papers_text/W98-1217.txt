The idea of '~familial relationships" among lan- 
guages is well-established and accepted, al- 
though some controversies persist in a few 
specific instances. By painstakingly record- 
ing and identifying regularities and similarities 
and comparing these to the historical record, 
linguists have been able to produce a general 
"family tree" incorporating most natural an- 
guages. 
We suggest here that much of these trees can 
be automatically determined by a complemen- 
tary technique of distributional nalysis. Re- 
cent work by (Farach et al, 1995) and (Juola, 
1997) suggests that Kullback-Leibler diver- 
gence (or cross-entropy) can be meaningfully 
measured from small samples, in some cases 
as small as only 20 or so words. Using these 
techniques, we define and measure a distance 
function between translations ofa small corpus 
(c. 70 words/sample) covering much of the ac- 
cepted Indo-European family, and reconstruct 
a relationship tree by hierarchical duster anal- 
ysis. The resulting tree shows remarkable sim- 
ilarity to the accepted Indo-European family; 
this we read as evidence both for the immense 
power of this measurement technique and for 
the validity of this kind of mechanical similar- 
ity judgement in the identification of typologi- 
cal relationships. Furthermore, this technique 
is in theory sensitive to different sorts of rela- 
tionships than more common word-list based 
methods and may help ilium;hate these from a 
different direction. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Over the past century, a large amount of research 
effort has gone into the establishment of structures 
describing the typological and taxonomic relation- 
ships among languages past and present; the well- 
known "Romance language" group, consisting of all 
the languages in some sense "descended from" Latin 
is an example. In addition to their inherent interest, 
the results of these studies can be of use in telling us 
about the relationships, cultures, and environments 
of people and tribes long-distant from our present 
world. 
Although these techniques are powerful, they are 
limited in their application in several ways. The 
traditional focus on word lists as the primary tool 
for language classification excludes yntax and mor- 
phology from consideration. By constructing these 
word lists out of only basic lexical items, the appli- 
cability is further limited. Although in theory these 
problems could be avoided by simply constructing 
different lists, there is still a problem with the vol- 
ume of data to be processed - -  if the comparisons 
are performed at the level of "language," it is dif- 
ficult if not impossible to discuss questions uch as 
whether "legal English" shows more French influence 
than "standard English" or vice versa. However, 
the answers (were they available) to questions like 
this could be useful to, for example, socioliaguists in
attempting to trace the relationships between and 
among subgroups within a culture. 
The results presented in this paper suggest hat 
distributional nalyses can provide much of the same 
sort of relationships, but by a different route and 
therefore with different limitations and complemen- 
tary to more standard techniques. This is develolSed 
further in a set of experiments which approximately 
reconstruct the accepted Indo-European family tree 
based on samples of running text of less than a page 
in length (and, in fact, typically under 70 words). 
2 Taxonomy 
Given the broad agreement found on the taxonomic 
relationships among languages \[for example, see the 
introductory textbooks by (Gleason, 1955; Crystal, 
1987; Finegan and Besnier, 1987), or the more au- 
thoritative (Bright, 1992; Asher and Simpson, 1994; 
Warnow, 1997)\] the classifications and relationships 
of figure 1 can be described as uncontroversial. For 
example, the languages of Dutch and German are

Figure 1: Genetic taxonomy of various languages 
rather self-evidently similar; they are also closely 
linked in terms of history, culture, and linguistic bor- 
rowing; this similarity is one of the sources of evi- 
dence for such linkages. Meanwhile, there's little or 
no evidence that the Germans and the Maori were 
ever in significant day-to-day contact, a judgement 
borne out by apparent dissimilarity. The most con- 
troversial point of the diagram, as a matter of fact, 
may be its tree-like structure, as will be discussed 
later. 
The usual method for generating such trees (or 
other representational structures) is to painstakingly 
compare representative samples of language, usually 
lists of lexical items, and identify similar or isomor- 
phic changes from among the lists (taking into ac- 
count historical and archeological evidence as appro- 
priate). (Swadesh, 1955), for example, has identified 
a hundred basic concepts that are, in theory, part 
of the basic vocabulary of a language and thus re- 
sistant to borrowing and replacement and subject 
only to the slow "evolutionary" pressures of linguis- 
tic change. By comparing the presentation of these 
concepts as lexical items and measuring the degree 
of change between two languages' presentations, one 
can determine the amount by which two languages 
have "drifted." 
In summary of the results of these and similar 
studies, (Finegan and Besnier, 1987) identify no less 
than eleven subgroups within the Indo-European 
family. In addition to the weli-known groups like 
Germanic, Italic, and "Slavonic" (described here), 
they list Albanian, Anatolian, Armenian, Baltic, 
Celtic, Greek, Indo-Iranian, and Tocharian. (Crys- 
tal, 1987) groups Baltic and Slavic but otherwise 
agrees with Finegan and Besnier, as does (Gleason, 
1955). This shows both the power of this technique 
as well as the degree to which it requires ubjec- 
tive evaluation; the overall relationships are gener- 
ally agreed upon, but "the devil is in the details" 
and opinions about exactly which changes are simi- 
lar remain to a certain extent educated guesses. 
Other minor problems with this technique xist; 
for example, Swadesh's vocabulary list is completely 
insensitive to other aspects of language such as mor- 
phology, syntax, and so forth. Because of its fo- 
cus on specific, basic words, it can be trapped (or 
tricked) by lexical drift (for example, "meat" is no 
longer the English word for "any foodstuff") or lex- 
ical holes where a clear cognate is not necessarily 
the most common or most frequent lexeme ((Forster 
et al, in press) has found that some of his Alpine 
languages have no lexeme for "to sit," for example.) 
Similar problems exist with regard to lexical bor- 
rowing; resistant o borrowing does not equate to 
proof against borrowing. Finally, this focus on these 
very basic terms and the evaluation of language as a 
whole may, to a certain extent, preclude the analysis 
of the paths of borrowing and the degree to which 
linguistic change is confined to or driven by partic- 
ular fields, social strata, and so forth. By confin- 
ing ourselves to pre-set lists of specific concepts, one 
runs the risk of picking the wrong concepts, espe- 
cially for specific sub-field s (which can be as finely 
subdivided as one likes; is this paper an example of 
"science," of "computer science," of "computational 
linguistics," or of "information-theoretic approaches 
to corpus-based computational linguistics"?) As a 
simple example, the phrase for "TCP/IP protocol" 
in most languages of the world is recognizably a bor- 
rowing from English, while much of the jargon in the 
martial arts community shows a strong Japanese in- 
fluence, even when the martial art itself derives from 
other countries or cultures. 
This suggests that there is a place for other mea- 
sures, both of language-in-use and of smaller sam- 
ples, as a supplement to traditional typological and 
taxonomic measures. The claim made here is that 
cross-entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) can 
be the basis for such a measurement.

3.1 Background 
English, as is well-known, is very predictable. Flu- 
ent English readers can confirm this for themselves 
by guessing which letter comes next in a word be- 
~aming psyc-. Experiments by (Shannon, 1951) in- 
dicate that most readers can guess more than half 
of the letters in running text based on their expert 
knowledge of the lexicon, structure, and semantics 
of English. 
This notion of predictability, as well as the asso- 
ciated concepts of complexity, compressiveness, and 
randomness, can be mathematically modelled using 
information entropy. As developed by (Shannon,

1948), the entropy of a (stationary, ergodic) message 
source is the amount of information, typically mea- 
sured in bits (yes/no questions), required to describe 
the successive messages emitted by that source to a 
recipient. As the set of possible messages becomes 
larger, or the distribution of messages becomes less 
predictable, the entropy of the source increases cor- 
respondingly, in accordance with Shannon's equa- 
tion: 
N 
H(P)  = - Z Pi" logz Pi (1) 
i= l  
where P is (the probability distribution of) a 
source capable of sending any of the messages 
1, 2, . . . ,  N, each with some probability Pi. (For con- 
tinuous distributions, imply replace the summation 
with the appropriate integral.) 
An important aspect of this brief description has 
significant ypological and taxonomic implications. 
Against what is the predictability ofthe distribution 
measured? The second term in the above equation 
is a measure of the efficiency of the representation f 
message i (obviously, more frequent messages should 
be made shorter for maximal efficiency, an observa- 
tion often attributed to Zipf), based on our estimate 
of the frequency with which i is transmitted. There- 
fore, we can generalize equation 1 to 
N 
/:/(P' Q) = - Z Pi" log2 qi (2) 
i----1 
where Q is a different distribution representing 
our best estimate of the true distribution P. This 
value (called the cross-entropy) achieves a minimum 
when P = Q, and H(P, P) = H(P) .  The difference 
between/: /and H , the so-called Kullback-Leibler 
divergence, can be taken as a measurement of the 
degree of similarity between P and Q.1 For further 
elaboration on this point, the reader is referred to 
the excellent treatment in (Bishop, 1995). 
This technique lends itself to a measurement of
similarity between two different sources, by estimat- 
ing the distributional parameters and calculating 
their cross-entropy. 
3.2 Method 
Obviously, much research has been done in the 
proper development of distributional models of En- 
glish (or other languages) and in the efficient estima- 
tion of the probability distribution; (Brown et al, 
1N.b. this is not a "distance metric" in the formal 
sense of the word (it's not symmetric, for one thing), 
but can be thought of as a distance for these purposes. 
1992) calculate the entropy of a statistical model 
of English that was produced by training a com- 
puter on literally billions of observations comprising 
a huge corpus of written English. (Wyner, in press) 
has suggested that one can determine the entropy 
to nearly as good accuracy based on much smaller 
sample sizes, but it remains an open research ques- 
tion how much text is actually needed. At billions 
of observations per test, it is obviously impractical 
to determine document-level properties (such as, for 
instance, authorship, register, difficulty of reading, 
or even the language in which a novel document is 
written), but if the tests can be made sufficiently 
sensitive to work with small texts, tests like this may 
be practical. 
(Farach et al, 1995; Wyner, in press) describe 
a novel algorithm for entropy estimation for which 
they claim very fast convergence time; using no more 
than about five pages of text, they can achieve nearly 
the same accuracy as (Brown et al, 1992). The 
heart of this technique is a measurement of "match 
length within a database." Wyner defines the match 
length Ln(x) of a sequence (xl, x2, . . . ,  xn, xn+x,...) 
as the length of the the longest prefix of the sequence 
(xn+x,...) that matches a contiguous ubstring of 
(z l , z2 , . . .  ,xn), and proves that this converges in 
the limit to the value ~ as n increases. 
A simple example should make this more clear : 
we consider for a moment he phrase 
HAMLET : TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS 
THE QUESTION 
and fix n at 21. Thus, the "database" is the char- 
acters "HAMLET : TO BE OR NOT" (length 21) 
and the string " TO BE THAT IS THE QUES- 
TION" is the remaining data; the prefix " TO BE"  
exactly matches the contiguous substring beginning 
of the eighth character and itself runs for seven char- 
acters, but the prefix " TO BE T" does not match a 
continuous substring of the database, and hence the 
match length L21 is seven. 
Using this technique, one can estimate the en- 
tropy of a sequence by sliding a block of n obser- 
vations along the sequence and calculating the the 
mean match length L (averaged over each step) and 
thus the estimated entropy/:/. So one calculates L21 
above, then calculates L21 for the string "AMLET 
: TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUES- 
TION ", then for "MLET : TO BE OR NOT TO 
BE THAT IS THE QUESTION W',  and so on. 
The application of this to measurement of cross- 
entropy is relatively straightforward. A "database" 
of n observations i  compiled for each language of 
interest and each successive symbol of the message 
stream of interest is used as the starting point for 
Juola . ? 143 Cross-Entropy and Linguistic Typology 
the maximal prefix to be found within the database. 
Although this loses some of the time-varying prop- 
erties of an entropy estimator (in particular, the 
database is fixed and will not shift to capture long- 
term regularities in an input stream), this should 
preserve the fundamental relationship that a closer 
fit (smaller cross-entropy) results in a longer mean 
match length. This permits us to measure cross- 
entropy with approximately the same convergence 
properties as the entropy estimation itself. 
The primary claim made in this paper is that the 
similarity measured by cross-entropy will have some 
of the same properties for typological nd taxonomic 
research as those of more conventional word-lists, 
but that cross-entropy is complementary in several 
ways. It is easier and more accurate to measure 
cross-entropy in this way, is sensitive to the sublan- 
guage of the samples used (and hence can be used 
for smaller-scale experiments), and is sensitive to as- 
pects of language, such as syntax, lexical choice, and 
style, that are not commonly found in word lists. For 
example, languages with similar lexical items but 
different structures (perhaps verb-medial instead of 
verb-final) will find fewer multi-word matches be- 
tween the databases, and thus will produce agreater 
measured istance, indicative not of the lexical dis- 
tance but of the syntactic. 
3.3 Corpora 
Several experiments have been performed to test 
this hypothesis. The first, detailed in (Juola, 1997) 
simply approaches this as a language-identification 
problem. Given a set of linguistic samples (in this 
case, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, and 
Spanish, plus, as distractors, Finnish, Finni.qh, and 
Maori) in which of the sampled languages was a 
novel text written? Using samples of 100, 250, and 
500 characters, 472 documents, ranging in size from 
<500 to several million characters. The remarkable 
accuracy possible, even with very small samples, is 
shown by the fact that, for instance, at the 250 char- 
acter level, only one document was miscategorized 
(German misclassified as Dutch), even when texts 
to be identified were from completely separate reg- 
isters. 
The second experiment involved the languages de- 
scribed in figure 1. Samples of 1000 characters from 
the beginning of the book of Genesis were taken from 
each of the languages (the Russian sample being 
automatically transliterated into a Latin-character 
"equivalent") and cross-entropy between each pair 
(e.g. how close German is to the Dutch database) 
was measured. These pairs were averaged (n.b. the 
cross-entropy between Dutch and German is not nec-

matrix, and agglomerative cluster analysis was per- 
formed to produce set of binary "tree" relationships. 
This analysis consisted of simply taking all pairwise 
distances, and making a "cluster" of the two clus- 
ters with the smallest minimum (mean, or maxi- 
mum) distance and continuing until the entire set 
was combined into a single cluster. (Obviously, these 
might produce three slightly different rees; results 
reported here are from the minimum tree through- 
out.) 
The third experiment was similar to but broader 
than the second. For the past several decades, an 
informal project of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, 
has been the gathering of translations of the tradi- 
tional declaration to be taken by all new members 
of the University (and others) before access can be 
granted to the books. As a convenience to the inter- 
national community of scholars, the librarians have 
attempted to gather translations of this declaration 
in as many languages as possible so that scholars 
can be made aware of what they are promising; as a 
goal, they have set for themselves the task of acquir- 
ing the declaration both in every language spoken 
in Europe (including some nearly "dead" languages 
such as Cornish and Breton) as well as in at least 
one official language for every country in the world 
(or at least every country represented at the United 
Nations). The definitive version of the declaration is
the one in English, reproduced here as figure 2; also 
reproduced is the translation into Basque. 
From this collection were taken samples of fifty- 
three languages, mostly spoken in Europe or derived 
from European languages (n.b. not necessarily of 
the Indo-European family, e.g. Basque and Maltese) 
and written primarily in the standard Latin script. 
These samples typically range between 300-400 char- 
acters each. As before, cross-entropy measurements 
were taken (and symmetrized) between every pair 
and used as the basis for an agglomerative cluster 
analysis.

4 Resu l t s  
As alluded to earlier, the results from the first exper- 
iment indicate that as few as 100 characters can be ? 
sufficient to identify the language in which a docu- 
ment is written; (Juola, 1997) contains more details. 
Vqithin the limitations of binary branching im- 
posed by the cluster analysis algorithm, the fam- 
ily tree of figure 1 was reproduced perfectly in the 
second experiment; the circled nodes are, of course, 
ternary in this figure but binary in the recovered 
tree. The experimental results show that, instead 
of ternary branching, Maori is considered to be 
more distant from the Indo-European cluster than 
is Finnish and that (transliterated) Russian is more 
distinct from the Germanic luster than is French; 
these findings, although not necessarily convincing 
from the standpoint of statistical significance, are 
certainly intuitively plausible given the geographic 
closeness and ease of communication a d therefore 
linguistic borrowing. On the other hand, (Warnow, 
1997) claims a greater degree of similarity between 
Slavic and Germanic languages than between Slavic 
and Romance; this discrepancy may simply reflect 
the accuracy limits of the corpus sizes used or may 
be evidence of a greater degree of cultural influence 
on Germany from the West than from the East which 
is not reflected in the basic vocabulary. 
The results of the third experiment are less per- 
fect, but in many regards more interesting. In gen- 
eral, the best results were obtained at what might 
be called "mid-level" regularities. (For simplicity, 
we concentrate here on the results of the mini- 
real distance cluster analysis.) For example, all 
the languages of the Iberian peninsula (Galacian, 
Portuguese, Occitan, Catalan, and Spanish) were 
grouped into one tree, which was attached to two 
of the three Ladin samples (Friulan and Romontsch) 
but not to Dolomitic Ladin, a result compatible with 
the findings of (Forster et al, in press) that the level 
of linguistic diversity within the "Alpine Romance" 
languages i as great as the difference between, e.g. 
French and Italian. This cluster itself can be ex- 
tended to incorporate all the Italic/Romance lan- 
guages except Latin itself; again, this is compatible 
with the findings of (Forster et al, in press), and 
plausible in itself if one assumes that it's more useful 
for a speaker of modern Ladin to be able to under- 
stand modern Italian than classical Latin. 
Similarly, (some of) the North Germanic lan- 
guages (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish) were 
clustered, as were the South Germanic languages 
Afrikaans, Dutch, German, Luxemburgish, and 
Frisian - -  but these two groups were themselves sep- 
arated, with Danish et al being measured as be- 
ing closer to the Romance cluster than to the South 
Germanic. Similarly, the different varieties of En- 
glish were widely separated, with Modern English, 
(Modern) Scots English, and Middle English being 
an identifiable cluster, but with Old English being 
grouped with Icelandic and Faeroese in a cluster dis- 
taut from anything else. 
The complete tree which the computer generated 
is attached on the following page. Each leaf is la- 
beled with the appropriate language and with the 
subfamily of Indo-European from which it derives. 
Non-Indo-European languages, uch as Basque or 
Finnish, are labelled with their families (in paren- 
theses). All labels are to be regarded as largely con- 
sensual and representing common opinions, rather 
than as necessarily authoritative statements; in some 
cases, even the existence of languages (e.g. Croat- 
inn vs. Serbo-Croatian) can be divisive, as much for 
political and nationalistic as for scientific reasons.

one hand, and the small samples on the other), are 
promising; mid-range similarities, which might be 
independently expected to be the most stable, are in- 
deed picked up with remarkable accuracy. Very sub- 
tle and distant relations are more likely to be masked 
by simple noise or random chance (cf. (Ringe, 
1992)), while closely similar languages may be so 
similar that lexical choice and style, in some cases of 
a single word (do I describe something as "big" or 
"large"?), may be enough to alter the very closely- 
knit relationships. (For example, the two Czech 
samples are not sisters, but aunt/niece, as the Slo- 
vak sample intervenes - - however, the Czech/Slovak 
samples themselves form a cluster.) Both of these 
effects can be expected to be reduced as the sam- 
ple sizes increase; the primary finding that a few 
hundred characters of language in use can discover 
many of the relationships captured by more tradi- 
tional methods in a numerical and objective way, 
avoiding the difficulties of interpreting whether two 
differences are "similar." 
One major point of controversy will undoubtedly 
be the use of a tree structure for describing these re- 
lationships. There are, of course, two major models 
for describing linguistic families, the "tree" model 
and the "wave" model, and although (Warnow, 
1997) may claim that the tree model is universally 
accepted except in cases of extremely closely related 
languages, this statement seems more firm than ab- 
solutely justified. However, the tree structure pre- 
sented here is more an artifact of the cluster analy- 
sis technique used (and certainly the forced binary 
branching is artifactual) than a property of the en- 
tropy measurement technique. 
One significant problem which has not been ad- 
dressed entirely is the question of alphabet effects. 
First, the very idea of evaluating linguistic simi- 
larity by examination of letters, instead of sounds, 
will strike a traditional comparativist asalmost non- 
sensical. Letter comparisons will only work to the 
extent hat correspondence in written form reflects 
regularities in linguistic forms. Fortunately, the let- 
ter/sound correspondence for most languages, and 
particularly for most alphabetic languages, is sig- 
nificantly better than random, if not quite perfect. 
Comparisons between languages using different al- 
phabets (for example between (Cyrillic) Russian and 
(Latin) English) produce uniformly and unsurpris- 
ingly huge differences. 
The work presented here restricts itself almost en- 
tirely to languages written in the conventional Latin 
alphabet (with occasional diacritical mark or un- 
usual character such as the Icelandic eth). However, 
even within this subset, focusing on written charac- 
ters, as opposed to sounds, can change the similarity 
metrics. In some cases, the letter/letter similarity 
can actually be better than the sound/sound similar- 
ity, for example in cases where accents have drifted 
while the written form has been stabilized (e.g. con- 
sider the English, American, and Australian pronun- 
ciations of the word "grass"), or in cases where par- 
ticular words have been borrowed but have had their 
pronunciation regularized to a local standard. In 
other cases, however, the same sound may be rep- 
resented by different characters (the German 'W' 
vs the English 'V', or the Old English thorn, tran- 
scribed in modern English as the digraph 'th'). A 
particularly problematic area can be in the represen- 
tation of diacritical marks - intuitively, one would 
expect hat the letters 5 and o would be somehow 
more similar than the letters e and o (or than t and 
o), particularly when one is considering words that 
may have been explicitly borrowed and lost their di- 
acritics in the process). 
In either of these instances, the borrowing itself 
can be read as evidence of cultural contact, pos- 
sibly in connection with geographic proximity. In 
this case, the difference in apparent similarity be- 
tween word-list methods (which presumably mea- 
sure more of the historical relationships of descent 
and derivation) and the proposed method (which in- 
corporates measurings of borrowing, and so forth) 
can be used as a complementary technique to mea- 
sure such things as the rate, source, and paths of 
borrowing. In particular, measuring letter/letter as 
well as sound/sound ifferences might be a useful 
additional source of information for comparativists. 
The possibility of two letters (or sounds) being 
"more similar" should also not be discounted (as has 
been done in this work). It was suggested above that 
5 and o are a "similar" letter pair; one would also 
expect hat, for ins tance , / f /and/v /are  "similar", 
especially in words borrowed into a language that 
doesn't have unvoiced consonants - while / f /  and 
/g/would be almost universally distinct. By treat- 
ing individual words/sounds a distinct, orthogonal, 
and unanalyzed symbols, the current echnique may 
lose this sort of information i  its measurements. 
On the other hand, this sort of measurement ex- 
plicitly allows document and subject level distinc- 
tions to be observed and validated. It is a com- 
monplace observation, for example, that there is a 
greater preponderance of Latin- and Greek- based 
words in (English) scientific discourse than in gen- 
eral conversation; this is not especially based on any 
particular difference in the choice of lexical items, 
but more generally on the subject of discourse and 
the fact that the lexical items available for scien- 
Juola 147 Cross-Entropy and Linguistic Typology 
tific discussions tend to be Latinate as opposed to 
Anglo-Saxon. (In other words, you can choose any 
word you like from the standard list - all of which are 
Latin-derived.) Thus, word-list based methods are 
unable to validate this distinction, and some other 
method such as comparative etymology might be re- 
quired. Again, the proposed method can be used 
to determine complementary information to that 
gained via traditional techniques; the observation of 
the Latineque words in scientific, but not conversa- 
tional, English will quite reasonably support he in- 
ference that scientists (or the group that gave rise to 
modem scientists) are more likely to have been ex- 
posed extensively to Latin than the general public, 
and thus that knowledge of Latin was characteristic 
of that particular segment of society. 
6 Future Work and Conclusions 
One obvious aspect of the Bodleian corpus is that, 
by construction, all items are translations of each 
other (or more accurately of the English). The ac- 
quisition of translated corpora in a sufficiently varied 
set of languages can be problematic; it would obvi- 
ously be useful to test to what extent cross-entropy 
can be used as a taxonomic relationship on related 
corpora that are not necessarily translations of each 
other. Similarly, much further work is required to 
determine the best method of analysis, whether by 
cluster analysis or other techniques, and what de- 
gree of accuracy can be expected with various corpus 
sizes, registers, &c. On the other hand, if it's hard 
to acquire small translated corpora, it's even harder 
to acquire large ones, and the sensitivity of Wyner's 
entropy estimation technique is an undoubted ad- 
vantage. 
Further research will also be required to deter- 
mine when to stop proclaiming relationships. As has 
been argued by (Ringe, 1992), the mere fact that two 
structures are similar does not imply that they are 
related; similarity may arise through mere chance. 
Given a reasonable model of language, it should be 
possible to determine what level of cross-entropy 
chance should predict, and thus when to stop ag- 
glutinating languages into proto-World and beyond, 
or determining whether a particular piano sonata 
should be classified as closer to Indo-European or 
Sino-Tibetian. 
Going further afield, once the possibility of pro- 
ducing document, instead of language, taxonomies 
is accepted, it is possible to discuss meaningfully 
and to consider concepts uch as the rate of change 
of a language (did English change more between 
1600-1650 than between 1900-1950?) or the vary- 
ing degrees of taxonomic relationships between var- 
ious stylistic or subject classes. More generally, this 
cross-entropic method provides a way of combining 
information about relationships from a variety of 
sources, including lexical availability, lexical choice, 
pronuncations, syntax, and so forth. 
Ultimately, cross-entropy will probably not re- 
place the word-list differentiation method of deter- 
mining historic and familial relationships between 
languages, but can provide a valuable supplement 
to more traditional methods, as well as being able 
to address questions that are currently unanswerable 
by standard methods. Cross-entropy appears to be 
a meaningful and easy to measure method of deter- 
mining "linguistic distance" that is more sensitive 
to variances in lexical choice, word usage, style, and 
syntax than conventional methods. Furthermore, 
this allows scientists to study taxonomic relation- 
ships among much smaller samples of language than 
were previously possible and to provide some sort of 
numerical validation (to be confirmed or rejected). 
Although much further work is necessary to deter- 
mine the exact limitations of this sort of similarity 
measurements, preliminary results indicate that the 
accepted taxonomy is nearly reconstructable from 
remarkably little corpora, which shows at least in 
principle the power of this technique.
