Abstract  
Analysts  grammar of Japanese tn the Mu-proJect

expressing const ra in ts  on s tng le  l ingu is t i c  
s t ructures  and ru les  fo r  se lec t ing  the most 
p re ferab le  readtngs are complete ly  d i f fe rent  In 
nature,  and that  ru les  fo r  se lec t ing  pre fera le  
readings should be u t i l i zed  tn ana lysts  grammars of  
p ract i ca l  HT systems. I t  ts a lso clatmed that  
procedural  cont ro l  ts essent ia l  tn in tegrat ing  such 
rules tnto  a un i f ied  grammar. Some sample ru les  
are gtven to make the po ints  of d iscussion c lear  
and concrete.  
1. I n t roduct ion  
The Hu-ProJect ts a Japanese nat tona l  p ro jec t  
supported by grants from the Special  Coord inat ion 
Funds fo r  Promoting Science & Technology of 
STA(Sctence and Technology Agency). whlch atms to  
develop Japanese-Engl ish and English-Japanese 
machine t rans la t ion  systems. Ve cur rent ly  res t r i c t  
the domain of t rans la t ion  to abst racts  of 
sc ient i f i c  and techno log ica l  papers. The systems 
are based on the t rans fer  approach\ [ ; \ ] ,  and cons is t  
of  three phases: ana lys ts ,  t rans fer  and generat ion .  
In thts  paper, we focus on the ana lysts  grammar of 
Japanese tn the Japanese-Engl ish system. The 
grammar has been developed by using GRADE which ts 
a programming language spec ia l l y  designed fo r  th ts  
p ro jec t \ [2 \ ] .  The grammar now consists  of about  900 
GRADE ru les .  The experiments so fa r  show that  the 
grammar works very wel l  and ts comprehensive enough 
to t reat  var ious  l ingu is t i c  phenomena tn abst racts .  
In thts  paper we wt l l  discuss some of the basic 
design pr inc ip les  of the grammar together  wtth i t s  
detat led  const ruct ion .  Some examples of grammar 
rules and analysts  resu l t s  wt l l  be shown to make 
the po ints  of our discussion c lear  and concrete.  
2. Procedural Grammar 
There has been a prominent tendency tn recent 
computat ional  l ingu is t i cs  to re -eva luate  CFG and 
use t t  d t rec t ly  or augment t t  to analyze 
sentences \ [3 .4 .5 \ ] .  In these systems(frameworks),  
CFG ru les  Independent ly descr ibe const ra in ts  on 
stng le  l ingu is t i c  s t ruc tures ,  and a un iversa l  ru le  
app l i ca t ion  mechanism automat ica l ly  produces a set 
of posstb le  s t ruc tures  which sat i s fy  the given 
const ra in ts .  I t  ts wel l -known,  however, that  such 
sets of posstb le  s t ruc tures  of ten become 
unmanageably la rge .  
Because two separate ru les  such as 
NP . . . . .  ? NP PREP-P  
VP . . . . .  ? VP PREP-P  
are usua l ly  prepared tn CFG grammars tn order to 
analyze noun and verb phrases modif ted by 
prepos i t iona l  phrases. CFG grammars prov ide two 
syntact i c  analyses fo r  
She was given f lowers  by her uncle.  
Furthermore. the ambigui ty  of  the sentence ts 
doubled by the lex lca l  ambigui ty  of "by" .  which can 
be read as e t ther  a locat tve  or an agenttve 
prepos i t ion .  Since the two syntact i c  s t ruc tures  
are recognized by compZetely independent ru\]es and 
the semantic in terpreta t ions  of "by" are given by 
independent processes tn the \ ]a ter  stages. I t  ts 
d i f f i cu l t  to compare these four  readings dur ing the 
anaZysts to gtve a preference to one of these four  
readings.  
A ru le  such as 
" I f  a sentence ts passlve and there ts a 
"by" -prepost t tona l  phrase, t t  ts o f ten the case 
that  the prepos i t iona l  phrase f t l l s  the deep 
agenttve case. ( t ry  th ts  ana\]ysts  f i r s t ) "  
seems reasonable and qu i te  useful  fo r  choosing the 
most p re ferab le  in terpreta t ion ,  but t t  cannot be 
expressed by re f in ing  the ord inary  CFG ru les .  Thts 
ktnd of  ru \ ]e  ts qu i te  d i f fe rent  In nature from a 
CFG ru \ ]e .  I t  ts not  a ru le  of  const ra in t  on a 
stng\]e \ ] tnguts t tc  s t ruc ture( in  fac t .  the above four  
readings are a \ ] l  \ ] tngu ls t tca l \ ]y  posstb \ ]e ) ,  but t t  
ts a "heur i s t i c "  ru\ ]e  concerned with  preference of 
readings,  which compares several  a l te rnat ive  
ana lysts  paths and chooses the most feas tb le  one. 
Human t rans la ters  (or  humans tn genera l )  have many 
267 
such preference rules based on vartous sorts of cue 
such as morphological forms of words, co l locat ions  
of words, text  s ty les ,  word semantics, etc.  These 
heur i s t i c  rules are quite useful not only for  
increasing e f f i c iency  but also for  preventing 
pro l i fe ra t ion  of analysts resu l ts .  As Wl lks\[6\]  
potnted out, we cannot use semanttc Information as 
constra ints  on stngle l ingu is t i c  s t ructures,  but 
Just as preference cues to choose the most feastb le  
In terpreta t ions  among l ingu is t i ca l l y  posstble 
In terpreta t ions .  We clatm that many sorts of 
preference cues other than semanttc ones ex is t  tn 
real texts  whtch cannot be captured by CFG rules.  
We w i l l  show tn thts  paper that .  by u t i l i z ing  
vartous sorts of preference cues. our analysts 
grammar of Japanese can work almost 
determtnts t tca l l y  to gtve the most preferable 
In terpreta t ion  as the f t r s t  output,  wtthout any 
extensive semanttc processing (note that  even 
"semant|c" processing cannot dtsambtguate the above 
sentence. The four readings are semantical ly  
poss ib le.  I t  requtres deep understanding of 
contexts or s i tuat ions ,  whtch we cannot expect tn a 
p rac t i ca l  MT system). 
In order to Integrate heur i s t i c  rules based on 
var|ous leve ls  of cues tnto a untfted analysts 
grammar, we have developed a programming langauage. 
GRADE. GRADE provtdes us wtth the fo l lowing 
fac i l i t i es .  
Exp l l c t t  Control of Rule Appl |cattons : 
Heur is t ic  rules can be ordered according to thet r  
strength(See 4-2).  
- Nu l t tp le  Relatton Representation : Vartous 
leve ls  of Informer|on Including morphological .  
syntact i c ,  semantic, logtca l  etc.  are expressed tn 
a s |ngle annotated tree and can be manipulated at 
any ttme durtng the analysts.  Thts ts requtred not 
only because many heur i s t i c  rules are based on 
heterogeneous leve ls  of cues. but also because the 
analysts grammar should perform semant ic / log ica l  
In te rpreta t ion  of sentences at the same ttme and 
the rules for  these phases should be wrt t ten tn the 
same framework as syntact ic  analysis rules (See 
4-2. 4-4). 
- Lextcon Drtven Processing : We can wrtte 
heur i s t i c  rules spect f tc  to a stngle or a 11mtted 
number of words such as rules concerned wtth 
co l locat ions  among words. These rules are strong 
tn the sense that they almost always succeed. They 
are stored tn the lextcon and tnvoked at 
appropriate times durtng the analysts wtthout 
decreasing e f f i c iency  (See 4-1). 
- Expltct% Def in i t ion  of Analysts Strategies : 
The whole analysts phase can be dtvtded into steps. 
Thts makes the whole grammar e f f i c ient ,  natural and 
easy %o read. Furthermore. s t ra teg ic  considerat ion 
plays an essent ia l  ro le  tn preventing undesirable 
in terpreta t ions  from betng generated (See 4-3). 
3 Organization of Grammar 
In thts sectton, we w i l l  give the organizat ion 
of the grammar necessary for  understanding the 
discuss|on |n the fo l low|ng  sect ions.  The matn 
components of the grammar are as fo l lows.  
(1) Post-Morphological Analysts 
(2) Determination of Scopes 
(3) Analysts of Stmple Noun Phrases 
(4) Analysts of Stmple Sentences 
(5) Analysts of Embedded Sentences (Re lat ive  
Clauses) 
(6) Analysts of Relat ionships of SentenCes 
(7) Analysts of Outer Cases 
(8) Contextual Processing (Processing of Omttted 
case elements. In terpreta t ion  of 'Ha' . e tc . )  
(9) Reduction of Structures for  Transfer Phase 
Each component conststs of from 60 to 120 
GRADE rules.  
47 morpho-syntacttc categor ies are provtded 
for  Japanese analysts ,  each of whtch has t ts  own 
lex tca l  descr ip t ion  format. 12.000 lex tca l  entrtes 
have already been prepared according to the 
formats. In thts  c lass i f i ca t ion .  Japanese nouns 
are categorized |nto 8 sub-classes according to 
thetr  morpho-syntacttc behavtour, and 53 semanttc 
markers are used to character ize thet r  semanttc 
behaviour. Each verb has a set of case frame 
descr ipt ions (CFD) whtch correspond to d i f fe rent  
usages of the verb. A CFD g|ves mapping rules 
between surface case markers (SCN - postpost t tona l  
case par t i c les  are used as SCN's tn Japanese) and 
thet r  deep case in terpreta t ions  (DCZ 33 deep 
cases are used). DC! of an SCM often depends on 
verbs so that the mapping rules are given %o CFD's 
of Ind iv idua l  verbs. A CFO also gtves a normal 
co l locat ion  between the verb and 
SCM's(postpositonal case par t i c les ) .  Oetatled 
lex tca l  descr ipt ions  are gtven and discussed tn 
another paper\ [7\] .  
The analysts resu l ts  are dependency trees 
whtch show the semanttc re la t ionsh ips  among tnput 
words. 
4. Typtcal Steps of Analysts Grammar 
In the fo l low ing ,  we w111 take some sample 
rules to I l l us t ra te  our points of discussion. 
4- ;  Relat ive Clauses 
Relat ive clause construct ions in Japanese 
express several d i f fe rent  re la t ionsh ips  between 
modifying clauses ( re la t ive  clauses) and the l r  
antecedents. Some re la t tve  clause construct ions 
268 
cannot be t rans la ted  as re la t ive  clauses tn 
Engltsh. Me c lass i f ied  Japanese re la t tve  clauses 
Into the fo l lowtn  9 four types, according to the 
re la t ionsh ips  between clauses and the i r  
antecedents. 
(1) Type 1 : Gaps In Cases 
One of the case elements of the re la t tve  
clause ts deleted and the antecedent f i l l s  the gap. 
(2) Type 2 : Gaps In Case Elements 
The antecedent modif ies a case element tn the 
clause. That ts.  a gap ex is ts  tn a noun phrase tn 
the clause. 
(3) Type 3 : Apposit ion 
The clause describes the content of the 
antecedent as the Engltsh " that" -c lause  tn ' the 
tdea that  the earth ts round'.  
(4) Type 4 : Par t la l  Appos l t lon  
The antecedent and the clause are re la ted  by 
cer ta in  semantic/pragmatic re la t ionsh ips .  The 
re la t ive  clause of thts type doesn't  have any gaps. 
This type cannot be t rans la ted  dt rec t ly  lnto  
English re la t ive  clauses. Me have to In terpo la te  
In English appropr iate phrases or clauses whtch are 
Imp l i c i t  tn Japanese. tn order to express the 
semantic/pragmatic re la t ionsh ips  between the 
antecedents and re la t ive  clauses exp l i c i t l y .  In 
other words, gaps exts t  tn the In terpo la ted  phrases 
or clauses. 
Because the above four types of re la t tve  
clauses have the same surface forms fn Japanese 
. . . . . . . . .  (verb)  (noun). 
RelattvefClause Antecedent 
careful  processing ts requtred to d|st tngutsh them 
(note that  the "antecedents' -modi f ied nouns- ape 
located a f te r  the re la t |ve  clauses tn Japanese). A 
sophist icated analysis  procedure has already been 
developed, which fu l l y  u t | l t zes  vartous levels  of 
heur i s t i c  cues as fo l lows .  
(Rule 1) There are a 11mtted number of nouns whtch 
are often used as antecedents of Type 3 clauses. 
(Rule 2) Vhen nouns wi th  cer ta |n  semanttc markers 
appear tn the re la t tve  clauses and those nouns are 
fo l lowed by one of spect f l c  postpost t tona l  case 
par t4c les ,  there ts a htgh poss ib i l i ty  that  the 
re la t tve  clauses are Type 2. In the fo l low ing  
example, the word "SHORISOKUDO"(processtn 9 speed) 
has the semanttc marker AO (a t t r ibute) .

Such lex tca l  rules are Invoked at the beginning of 
the re la t tve  clause analysts by a ru le  tn the math 
flow of processing. The noun "KEKKA ? ( resu l t )  is 
given a mark as a lex lca l  property which Indicates 
the noun has special rules to be Invoked when t t  
appears as an antecedent of a re la t lve  clause. A11 
the nouns which requlre speclal  treatments In the 
re la t ive  clause analysts are given the same marker .  
The rule tn the matn f low only checks thts mark and 
Invokes the lex tca l  rules defined tn the lextcon.  
(Rule 5) Only the cases marked by postpostt tonal  
case par t i c les  'GA'. 'WO" and 'NI" can be deleted 
tn Type 1 re la t tve  clauses, when the antecedents 
are ordtnary nouns. Gaps tn Type 1 re la t ive  clauses 
can have other surface case marks, only when the 
antecedents are spectal nouns such as described tn 
Rule (3).  
4-2 ConJuncted Noun Phrases 
ConJuncted noun phrases often appear in 
abstracts of sc ient i f i c  and technological  papers. 
I t  ts Important to analyze them cor rec t ly .  
espec ia l ly  to determine scopes of conjunctions 
cor rec t ly ,  because they often lead to p ro l i fe ra t ion  
of analysis resu l ts .  The par t i c le  "TO" plays 
almost the same ro le  as the Engllsh "and" to 
conjunct noun phrases. There are several heur i s t i c  
rules based on various levels  of information to 
determine the scopes. 
<Scope Decision Rules of ConJuncted Noun Phrases 
by Par t l c le  'TO'> 
(Rule 1)  Stnce par t tc le  "TO" ts also used as a case 
par t i c le ,  t f  I t  appears tn the pos i t ion :  
Noun 'TO" verb Noun, 
Noun 'TO' ad jec t ive  Noun. 
there are two posstble In terpreta t ions .  one tn 
whlch "TO" Is a case par t tc le  and "noun TO 
ad jec t ive(verb) '  forms a re la t tve  clause that  
modif ies the second noun. and the other one tn 
which "TO" ts a conjunct ive par t i c le  to form a 
conJuncted noun phrase. However. i t  ts very 11kely 
that the par t tc le  'TO' ts not 8 conjunct ive 
par t tc le  but a pos t -pos i t iona l  case par t i c le ,  i f  
the ad jec t ive  (verb) ts one of ad ject ives  (verbs) 
which requtre case elements wtth surface case mark 
"TO' and there are no extra  words between "TO ? end 
the ad ject ive  (verb) .  In the fo l lowing  example. 
"KOTONARU(to be d i f fe rent ) "  ts an ad jec t ive  which 
ts often co l located wtth a noun phrase fo l lowed by 
case par t i c le  "TO".

the r ight  boundary of the scope of the conJuctton 
ts almost always Noun-2. The second 'TO" plays a 
ro le of a de l imi te r  which deltmtts the r ight  
boundary of the conjunct ion.  Thts 'TO" tS 
opt iona l ,  but tn real texts  one often places t t  to 
make the scope unambiguous, espec ia l l y  when the 
second conjunct IS a long noun phrase and the scope 
is h ighly  ambiguous without t t .  Because the second 
'TO' can be Interpreted as a case par t tc le  (not as 
a de l imi te r  of the conjunct ion)  and 'NO' fo l low ing  
a case par t tc le  turns the preceding phrase to a

"NOUN-2 TO NO" ts taken as o modtr ter  of NOUN-3 and

In most cases, when two 'TO" par t i c les  appear tn

(Rule 6) I f  some spectal words (11ke 'SONO" 
'SORE-NO' etc.  whtch roughly correspond to ' the ' .  
'1 iS '  tn Engl lsh) appear tn the pos i t ion :  
Phrases whtchlNoun-1 "TO' <spectal word> Noun-2. 
modtfy noun

the modi f iers  preceding Noun-1 modtfy only Noun*l 
but not the whole conJuncted noun phrase. 
(Rule 7) \[n 
. . . . . .  Noun-1 'TO' . . . . . . . . . . . .  Noun-2. 
t f  Noun-1 and flour-2 belong to the same spect f tc  
semanttc categor ies ,  11Le actton nouns, abstract  
nouns etc,  the r tght  boundary ts often Noun-2. 
(Rule 8) \[n most conJuncted noun phrases, the 
structures of conJuncts are wel l -balanced.  
Therefore, t f  a re la t tve  clause precedes the f i r s t  
conjunct and the length of the second conjunct (the 
number of words between 'TO" and Noun-2) ts short 
11ke 
\ [Re la t ive  Clause\] Noun-1 'TO" . . . . . . . .  Noun-2 
the re la t tve  clause modtftes both conJuncts, that 
ts. the antecedent of the re la t tve  clause ts the 
whole conJuncted phrase. 
These heur i s t i c  rules are based on d i f fe rent  
levels  of Information (some are based on surface 
lex lca l  Items. some are based on morphemes of 
words, some on semanttc |nformatton) and may lead 
to d i f fe rent  decisions about scopes. However. we 
can d is t ingu ish  strong heur i s t i c  rules ( t .e .  rules 
whtch almost always give correct  scopes when they 
are appl led)  from others. In fac t .  there extsts  
some ordertng of heur i s t i c  rules according to thet r  
strength.  Rules (1) .  (2).  (3),  (4) and (6).  for  
example, almost always succeed, and rules l i ke  (7) 
and (8) often lead to wrong decis ions.  Rules 11ke 
(7) and (8) should be treated as defaul t  rules 
whtch are applted only when the other stronger 
rules cannot dectde the scopes. We can deftne tn 
GRADE an arb i t ra ry  ordertng of rule app l i cat ions .  
Thts capab i l i ty  of contro114ng the sequences of 
rule app l icat ions  ts essent ia l  tn In tegrat ing  
heur i s t i c  rules based on heterogeneous leve ls  of 
Information tnto a untr ied set of ru les.  
Note that  most of these rules cannot be 
natura l l y  expressed by ordtnary CFG ru les.  Rule 
(2).  for  example, ts a ru le  whtch blocks the 
app l i ca t ion  of the ordtnary CFG ru le  such as 
NP - - -> NP <case-part ic le> NO N 
when the <case-part ic le> ts 'TO' and a conjunct ive 
par t tc le  'TO' precedes thts sequence of words. 
4-3 Determination of Scopes 
Scopes of conJuncted noun phrases often 
overlap wtth scopes of re la t tve  clauses, whtch 
males the problem of scope determinat ion more 
complicated. For the surface sequence of phrases 
11ke 
NP-1 'TO' NP-2 <case-part ic le> . . . . .  <verb> NP-3 
there are two passable 
scopes of conJuncted noun

5 Conclusions 
Analysts Grammar of  Japanese tn the Mu-proJect 
ts discussed tn th ts  paper. By In tegrat ing  vartous 
leve ls  of heur i s t i c  In fo rmat ion ,  the grammar can 
work very e f f i c ient ly  to produce the most natura l  
and pre ferab le  readtn 9 as the f | r s t  output  resu l t .  
wt thout  any extens ive  semanttc processtngs. 
The concept of procedural  granwars was 
or ig ina l ly  proposed by Wtnograd\[9\] and 
Independently persued by other  research groups\ [ lO\ ] .  
However. thet r  clatms have not been wel l  
appreciated by other  researchers (or  even by 
themselves).  One of ten argues agatnst  procedural  
grammars, saytng that :  the l ingu is t i c  facts  
Wtnograd's grammar captures can a lso be expressed 
by ATN. and the express ive power of ATN ts 
equ iva lent  wtth that  of the augmented CFG. 
Therefore;  procedural  grammars have no advantages 
over the augmented CFG. They Just make the whole 
grammars complicated and hard to mainta in .  
The above argument, however, mtsses an 
Important po |nt  and confuses procedural  grammar 
wtth the representat ion  of grammars tn the form of 
programs (as Shown tn Vtnograd\ [9 \ ] ) .  Ve showed tn 
thts  paper that :  the ru les  whtch gtve s t ruc tura l  
const ra in ts  on f tna l  ana lysts  resu l t s  and the ru les  
whtch choose the most p re ferab le  l ingu is t i c  
s t ructures  (or  the ru les  whtch block "garden path" 
s t ruc tures )  are d i f fe rent  tn nature.  \[n order to 
In tegrate  the la t te r  type of ru les  tn a unt f ted  
analysts  grammar, t t  ts essent ia l  to cont ro l  the 
sequence of ru le  app l i ca t ions  exp l i c i t l y  and 
Introduce s t ra teg ic  knowledge tnto  grammar 
organ izat ions .  Furthermore. In t roduct ion  of 
contro l  spec i f i ca t ions  doesn ' t  necessar i l y  lead to 
the grammar In the form of programs. Our grammar 
wr t t tng  system GRADE a l lows us a ru le  based

by ustng GRADE ts easy to ma inta in .

phenomena tn natura l  languages. Lax|con drtven 
prcesstng ts ext remely  useful  tn the t rans fer  phase
