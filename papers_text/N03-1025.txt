Abstract
We present a simple method for language inde-
pendent and task independent text categoriza-
tion learning, based on character-level n-gram
language models. Our approach uses simple
information theoretic principles and achieves
effective performance across a variety of lan-
guages and tasks without requiring feature se-
lection or extensive pre-processing. To demon-
strate the language and task independence of
the proposed technique, we present experimen-
tal results on several languages?Greek, En-
glish, Chinese and Japanese?in several text
categorization problems?language identifica-
tion, authorship attribution, text genre classifi-
cation, and topic detection. Our experimental
results show that the simple approach achieves
state of the art performance in each case.
1 Introduction
Text categorization concerns the problem of automati-
cally assigning given text passages (paragraphs or doc-
uments) into predefined categories. Due to the rapid ex-
plosion of texts in digital form, text categorization has
become an important area of research owing to the need
to automatically organize and index large text collections
in various ways. Such techniques are currently being ap-
plied in many areas, including language identification,
authorship attribution (Stamatatos et al, 2000), text genre
classification (Kesseler et al, 1997; Stamatatos et al,
2000), topic identification (Dumais et al, 1998; Lewis,
1992; McCallum, 1998; Yang, 1999), and subjective sen-
timent classification (Turney, 2002).
Many standard machine learning techniques have been
applied to automated text categorization problems, such
as naive-Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, lin-
ear least squares models, neural networks, and K-nearest
neighbor classifiers (Yang, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002). A
common aspect of these approaches is that they treat text
categorization as a standard classification problem, and
thereby reduce the learning process to two simple steps:
feature engineering, and classification learning over the
feature space. Of these two steps, feature engineering is
critical to achieving good performance in text categoriza-
tion problems. Once good features are identified, almost
any reasonable technique for learning a classifier seems
to perform well (Scott, 1999).
Unfortunately, the standard classification learning
methodology has several drawbacks for text categoriza-
tion. First, feature construction is usually language de-
pendent. Various techniques such as stop-word removal
or stemming require language specific knowledge to de-
sign adequately. Moreover, whether one can use a purely
word-level approach is itself a language dependent issue.
In many Asian languages such as Chinese or Japanese,
identifying words from character sequences is hard, and
any word-based approach must suffer added complexity
in coping with segmentation errors. Second, feature se-
lection is task dependent. For example, tasks like au-
thorship attribution or genre classification require atten-
tion to linguistic style markers (Stamatatos et al, 2000),
whereas topic detection systems rely more heavily on bag
of words features. Third, there are an enormous num-
ber of possible features to consider in text categorization
problems, and standard feature selection approaches do
not always cope well in such circumstances. For exam-
ple, given an enormous number of features, the cumu-
lative effect of uncommon features can still have an im-
portant effect on classification accuracy, even though in-
frequent features contribute less information than com-
mon features individually. Consequently, throwing away
uncommon features is usually not an appropriate strat-
egy in this domain (Aizawa, 2001). Another problem is
that feature selection normally uses indirect tests, such
as ?2 or mutual information, which involve setting arbi-
                                                               Edmonton, May-June 2003

trary thresholds and conducting a heuristic greedy search
to find good feature sets. Finally, by treating text cate-
gorization as a classical classification problem, standard
approaches can ignore the fact that texts are written in
natural language, meaning that they have many implicit
regularities that can be well modeled with specific tools
from natural language processing.
In this paper, we propose a straightforward text cate-
gorization learning method based on learning category-
specific, character-level, n-gram language models. Al-
though this is a very simple approach, it has not yet been
systematically investigated in the literature. We find that,
surprisingly, we obtain competitive (and often superior)
results to more sophisticated learning and feature con-
struction techniques, while requiring almost no feature
engineering or pre-processing. In fact, the overall ap-
proach requires almost no language specific or task spe-
cific pre-processing to achieve effective performance.
The success of this simple method, we think, is due to
the effectiveness of well known statistical language mod-
eling techniques, which surprisingly have had little sig-
nificant impact on the learning algorithms normally ap-
plied to text categorization. Nevertheless, statistical lan-
guage modeling is also concerned with modeling the se-
mantic, syntactic, lexicographical and phonological regu-
larities of natural language?and would seem to provide a
natural foundation for text categorization problems. One
interesting difference, however, is that instead of explic-
itly pre-computing features and selecting a subset based
on arbitrary decisions, the language modeling approach
simply considers all character (or word) subsequences
occurring in the text as candidate features, and implic-
itly considers the contribution of every feature in the fi-
nal model. Thus, the language modeling approach com-
pletely avoids a potentially error-prone feature selection
process. Also, by applying character-level language mod-
els, one also avoids the word segmentation problems that
arise in many Asian languages, and thereby achieves a
language independent method for constructing accurate
text categorizers.
2 n-Gram Language Modeling
The dominant motivation for language modeling has tra-
ditionally come from speech recognition, but language
models have recently become widely used in many other
application areas.
The goal of language modeling is to predict the prob-
ability of naturally occurring word sequences, s =
w1w2...wN ; or more simply, to put high probability on
word sequences that actually occur (and low probability
on word sequences that never occur). Given a word se-
quence w1w2...wN to be used as a test corpus, the quality
of a language model can be measured by the empirical
perplexity and entropy scores on this corpus
Perplexity = N
????
N?
i=1
1
Pr(wi|w1...wi?1) (1)
Entropy = log2 Perplexity (2)
where the goal is to minimize these measures.
The simplest and most successful approach to lan-
guage modeling is still based on the n-gram model. By
the chain rule of probability one can write the probability
of any word sequence as
Pr(w1w2...wN ) =
N?
i=1
Pr(wi|w1...wi?1) (3)
An n-gram model approximates this probability by
assuming that the only words relevant to predicting
Pr(wi|w1...wi?1) are the previous n? 1 words; i.e.
Pr(wi|w1...wi?1) = Pr(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1)
A straightforward maximum likelihood estimate of n-
gram probabilities from a corpus is given by the observed
frequency of each of the patterns
Pr(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1) = #(wi?n+1...wi)#(wi?n+1...wi?1) (4)
where #(.) denotes the number of occurrences of a spec-
ified gram in the training corpus. Although one could at-
tempt to use simple n-gram models to capture long range
dependencies in language, attempting to do so directly
immediately creates sparse data problems: Using grams
of length up to n entails estimating the probability of Wn
events, where W is the size of the word vocabulary. This
quickly overwhelms modern computational and data re-
sources for even modest choices of n (beyond 3 to 6).
Also, because of the heavy tailed nature of language (i.e.
Zipf?s law) one is likely to encounter novel n-grams that
were never witnessed during training in any test corpus,
and therefore some mechanism for assigning non-zero
probability to novel n-grams is a central and unavoidable
issue in statistical language modeling. One standard ap-
proach to smoothing probability estimates to cope with
sparse data problems (and to cope with potentially miss-
ing n-grams) is to use some sort of back-off estimator.
Pr(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1)
=
?
???

P?r(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1),
if #(wi?n+1...wi) > 0
?(wi?n+1...wi?1)? Pr(wi|wi?n+2...wi?1),
otherwise
(5)
where
P?r(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1) = discount#(wi?n+1...wi)#(wi?n+1...wi?1)
(6)
is the discounted probability and ?(wi?n+1...wi?1) is a
normalization constant
?(wi?n+1...wi?1) =
1?
?
x?(wi?n+1...wi?1x)
P?r(x|wi?n+1...wi?1)
1?
?
x?(wi?n+1...wi?1x)
P?r(x|wi?n+2...wi?1)
(7)
The discounted probability (6) can be computed
with different smoothing techniques, including absolute
smoothing, Good-Turing smoothing, linear smoothing,
and Witten-Bell smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).
The details of the smoothing techniques are omitted here
for simplicity.
The language models described above use individual
words as the basic unit, although one could instead con-
sider models that use individual characters as the ba-
sic unit. The remaining details remain the same in this
case. The only difference is that the character vocabu-
lary is always much smaller than the word vocabulary,
which means that one can normally use a much higher
order, n, in a character-level n-gram model (although the
text spanned by a character model is still usually less
than that spanned by a word model). The benefits of the
character-level model in the context of text classification
are several-fold: it avoids the need for explicit word seg-
mentation in the case of Asian languages, it captures im-
portant morphological properties of an author?s writing,
it models the typos and misspellings that are common in
informal texts, it can still discover useful inter-word and
inter-phrase features, and it greatly reduces the sparse
data problems associated with large vocabulary models.
In this paper, we experiment with character-level models
to achieve flexibility and language independence.
3 Language Models as Text Classifiers
Our approach to applying language models to text cat-
egorization is to use Bayesian decision theory. Assume
we wish to classify a text D into a category c ? C =
{c1, ..., c|C|}. A natural choice is to pick the category c
that has the largest posterior probability given the text.
That is,
c? = argmax
c?C
{Pr(c|D)} (8)
Using Bayes rule, this can be rewritten as
c? = argmax
c?C
{Pr(D|c) Pr(c)} (9)
= argmax
c?C
{Pr(D|c)} (10)
= argmax
c?C
{ N?
i=1
Prc(wi|wi?n+1...wi?1)
}
(11)
where deducing Eq. (10) from Eq. (9) assumes uniformly
weighted categories (since we have no other prior knowl-
edge). Here, Pr(D|c) is the likelihood of D under cate-
gory c, which can be computed by Eq. (11). Likelihood is
related to perplexity and entropy by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2).
Therefore, our approach is to learn a separate language
model for each category, by training on a data set from
that category. Then, to categorize a new text D, we sup-
ply D to each language model, evaluate the likelihood
(or entropy) of D under the model, and pick the winning
category according to Eq. (10).
The inference of an n-gram based text classifier is
very similar to a naive-Bayes classifier. In fact, n-gram
classifiers are a straightforward generalization of naive-
Bayes: A uni-gram classifier with Laplace smoothing
corresponds exactly to the traditional naive-Bayes clas-
sifier. However, n-gram language models, for larger n,
possess many advantages over naive-Bayes classifiers, in-
cluding modeling longer context and applying superior
smoothing techniques in the presence of sparse data.
4 Experimental Comparison
We now proceed to present our results on several text
categorization problems on different languages. Specif-
ically, we consider language identification, Greek author-
ship attribution, Greek genre classification, English topic
detection, Chinese topic detection and Japanese topic de-
tection.
For the sake of consistency with previous re-
search (Aizawa, 2001; He et al, 2000; Stamatatos et
al., 2000), we measure categorization performance by the
overall accuracy, which is the number of correctly iden-
tified texts divided by the total number of texts consid-
ered. We also measure the performance with Macro F-
measure, which is the average of the F-measures across
all categories. F-measure is a combination of precision
and recall (Yang, 1999).
4.1 Language Identification
The first text categorization problem we examined was
language identification?a useful pre-processing step in
information retrieval. Language identification is proba-
bly the easiest text classification problem because of the
significant morphological differences between languages,

even when they are based on the same character set.1 In
our experiments, we considered one chapter of Bible that
had been translated into 6 different languages: English,
French, German, Italian, Latin and Spanish. In each
case, we reserved twenty sentences from each language
for testing and used the remainder for training. For this
task, with only bi-gram character-level models and any
smoothing technique, we achieved 100% accuracy.
4.2 Authorship Attribution
The second text categorization problem we examined was
author attribution. A famous example is the case of the
Federalist Papers, of which twelve instances are claimed
to have been written both by Alexander Hamilton and
James Madison (Holmes and Forsyth, 1995). Authorship
attribution is more challenging than language identifica-
tion because the difference among the authors is much
more subtle than that among different languages. We con-
sidered a data set used by (Stamatatos et al, 2000) con-
sisting of 20 texts written by 10 different modern Greek
authors (totaling 200 documents). In each case, 10 texts
from each author were used for training and the remain-
ing 10 for testing.
The results using different orders of n-gram models
and different smoothing techniques are shown in Table 1.
With 3-grams and absolute smoothing, we observe 90%
accuracy. This result compares favorably to the 72%
accuracy reported in (Stamatatos et al, 2000) which is
based on linear least square fit (LLSF).
4.3 Text Genre Classification
The third problem we examined was text genre classifi-
cation, which is an important application in information
retrieval (Kesseler et al, 1997; Lee et al, 2002). We con-
sidered a Greek data set used by (Stamatatos et al, 2000)
consisting of 20 texts of 10 different styles extracted from
various sources (200 documents total). For each style, we
used 10 texts as training data and the remaining 10 as test-
ing.

The results of learning an n-gram based text classifier
are shown in Table 2. The 86% accuracy obtained with
bi-gram models compares favorably to the 82% reported
in (Stamatatos et al, 2000), which again is based on a
much deeper NLP analysis.
4.4 Topic Detection
The fourth problem we examined was topic detection in
text, which is a heavily researched text categorization
problem (Dumais et al, 1998; Lewis, 1992; McCallum,
1998; Yang, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002). Here we demon-
strate the language independence of the language mod-
eling approach by considering experiments on English,
Chinese and Japanese data sets.
4.4.1 English Data
The English 20 Newsgroup data has been widely used
in topic detection research (McCallum, 1998; Rennie,
2001).2 This collection consists of 19,974 non-empty
documents distributed evenly across 20 newsgroups. We
use the newsgroups to form our categories, and randomly
select 80% of the documents to be used for training and
set aside the remaining 20% for testing.
In this case, as before, we merely considered text to be
a sequence of characters, and learned character-level n-
gram models. The resulting classification accuracies are
reported in in Table 3. With 3-gram (or higher order)
models, we consistently obtain accurate performance,
peaking at 89% accuracy in the case of 6-gram models
with Witten-Bell smoothing. (We note that word-level
models were able to achieve 88% accuracy in this case.)
These results compare favorably to the state of the art re-
sult of 87.5% accuracy reported in (Rennie, 2001), which
was based on a combination of an SVM with error correct
output coding (ECOC).
4.4.2 Chinese Data
Chinese topic detection is often thought to be more
challenging than English, because words are not white-
space delimited in Chinese text. This fact seems to

Table 4: Chinese topic detection results
require word segmentation to be performed as a pre-
processing step before further classification (He et al,
2000). However, we avoid the need for explicit segmen-
tation by simply using a character level n-gram classifier.
For Chinese topic detection we considered a data set
investigated in (He et al, 2000). The corpus in this case
is a subset of the TREC-5 data set created for research on
Chinese text retrieval. To make the data set suitable for
text categorization, documents were first clustered into
101 groups that shared the same headline (as indicated
by an SGML tag) and the six most frequent groups were
selected to make a Chinese text categorization data set.
In each group, 500 documents were randomly selected
for training and 100 documents were reserved for testing.
We observe over 80% accuracy for this task, using bi-
gram (2 Chinese characters) or higher order models. This
is the same level of performance reported in (He et al,
2000) for an SVM approach using word segmentation
and feature selection.
4.4.3 Japanese Data
Japanese poses the same word segmentation issues as
Chinese. Word segmentation is also thought to be neces-
sary for Japanese text categorization (Aizawa, 2001), but
we avoid the need again by considering character level
language models.
We consider the Japanese topic detection data inves-
tigated by (Aizawa, 2001). This data set was con-

Table 5: Japanese topic detection results
verted from the NTCIR-J1 data set originally created for
Japanese text retrieval research. The data has 24 cate-
gories. The testing set contains 10,000 documents dis-
tributed unevenly between categories (with a minimum of
56 and maximum of 2696 documents per category). This
imbalanced distribution causes some difficulty since we
assumed a uniform prior over categories. Although this is
easily remedied, we did not fix the problem here. Never-
theless, we obtain experimental results in Table 5 that still
show an 84% accuracy rate on this problem (for 6-gram
or higher order models). This is the same level of per-
formance as that reported in (Aizawa, 2001), which uses
an SVM approach with word segmentation, morphology
analysis and feature selection.
5 Analysis
The perplexity of a test document under a language model
depends on several factors. The two most influential fac-
tors are the order, n, of the n-gram model and the smooth-
ing technique used. Different choices will result in differ-
ent perplexities, which could influence the final decision
in using Eq. (10). We now experimentally assess the in-
fluence of each of these factors below.
5.1 Effects of n-Gram Order
The order n is a key factor in n-gram language models.
If n is too small then the model will not capture enough
context. However, if n is too large then this will create
severe sparse data problems. Both extremes result in a
larger perplexity than the optimal context length. Figures
1 and 2 illustrate the influence of order n on classifica-
tion performance and on language model quality in the
previous five experiments (all using absolute smoothing).
Note that in this case the entropy (bits per character) is
the average entropy across all testing documents. From
the curves, one can see that as the order increases, classi-
fication accuracy increases and testing entropy decreases,
presumably because the longer context better captures the
regularities of the text. However, at some point accu-

as the sparse data problems begin to set in. Interest-
ingly, the effect is more pronounced in some experiments
(Greek genre classification) but less so in other experi-
ments (topic detection under any language). The sensi-
tivity in the Greek genre case could still be attributed to
the sparse data problem (the over-fitting problem in genre
classification could be more serious than the other prob-
lems, as seen from the entropy curves).
5.2 Effects of Smoothing Technique
Another key factor affecting the performance of a lan-
guage model is the smoothing technique used. Figures 3
and 4 show the effects of smoothing techniques on clas-
sification accuracy and testing entropy (Chinese topic de-
tection and Japanese topic detection are not shown in the
figure to save space).
Here we find that, in most cases, the smoothing tech-
nique does not have a significant effect on text catego-
rization accuracy, because of the small vocabulary size of

Figure 4: The entropy of different smoothing
character level n-gram models. However, there are two
exceptions?Greek authorship attribution and Greek text
genre classification?where Good-Turing smoothing is
not as effective as other techniques, even though it gives
better test entropy than some others. Since our goal is to
make a final decision based on the ranking of perplexi-
ties, not just their absolute values, a superior smoothing
method in the sense of perplexity reduction (i.e. from
the perspective of classical language modeling) does not
necessarily lead to a better decision from the perspec-
tive of categorization accuracy. In fact, in all our exper-
iments we have found that it is Witten-Bell smoothing,
not Good-Turing smoothing, that gives the best results in
terms of classification accuracy. Our observation is con-
sistent with previous research which reports that Witten-
Bell smoothing achieves benchmark performance in char-
acter level text compression (Bell et al, 1990). For the
most part, however, one can use any standard smooth-
ing technique in these problems and obtain comparable
performance, since the rankings they produce are almost
always the same.
5.3 Relation to Previous Research
In principle, any language model can be used to perform
text categorization based on Eq. (10). However, n-gram
models are extremely simple and have been found to be
effective in many applications. For example, character
level n-gram language models can be easily applied to
any language, and even non-language sequences such as
DNA and music. Character level n-gram models are
widely used in text compression?e.g., the PPM model
(Bell et al, 1990)?and have recently been found to be
effective in text classification problems as well (Teahan
and Harper, 2001). The PPM model is a weighted lin-
ear interpolation n-gram models and has been set as a
benchmark in text compression for decades. Building an
adaptive PPM model is expensive however (Bell et al,
1990), and our back-off models are relatively much sim-
pler. Using compression techniques for text categoriza-
tion has also been investigated in (Benedetto et al, 2002),
where the authors seek a model that yields the minimum
compression rate increase when a new test document is
introduced. However, this method is found not to be gen-
erally effective nor efficient (Goodman, 2002). In our ap-
proach, we evaluate the perplexity (or entropy) directly
on test documents, and find the outcome to be both effec-
tive and efficient.
Many previous researchers have realized the impor-
tance of n-gram models in designing language indepen-
dent text categorization systems (Cavnar and Trenkle,
1994; Damashek, 1995). However, they have used n-
grams as features for a traditional feature selection pro-
cess, and then deployed classifiers based on calculating
feature-vector similarities. Feature selection in such a
classical approach is critical, and many required proce-
dures, such as stop word removal, are actually language
dependent. In our approach, all n-grams are considered
as features and their importance is implicitly weighted by
their contribution to perplexity. Thus we avoid an error
prone preliminary feature selection step.
6 Conclusion
We have presented an extremely simple approach for lan-
guage and task independent text categorization based on
character level n-gram language modeling. The approach
is evaluated on four different languages and four differ-
ent text categorization problems. Surprisingly, we ob-
serve state of the art or better performance in each case.
We have also experimentally analyzed the influence of
two factors that can affect the accuracy of this approach,
and found that for the most part the results are robust
to perturbations of the basic method. The wide appli-
cability and simplicity of this approach makes it imme-
diately applicable to any sequential data (such as natu-
ral language, music, DNA) and yields effective baseline
performance. We are currently investigating more chal-
lenging problems like multiple category classification us-
ing the Reuters-21578 data set (Lewis, 1992) and subjec-
tive sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). To us, these
results suggest that basic statistical language modeling
ideas might be more relevant to other areas of natural lan-
guage processing than commonly perceived.
