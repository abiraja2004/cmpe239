Abstract
Transliteration is defined as phonetic
translation of names across languages.
Transliteration of Named Entities (NEs)
is necessary in many applications, such
as machine translation, corpus alignment,
cross-language IR, information extraction
and automatic lexicon acquisition. All
such systems call for high-performance
transliteration, which is the focus of
shared task in the NEWS 2010 workshop.
The objective of the shared task is to pro-
mote machine transliteration research by
providing a common benchmarking plat-
form for the community to evaluate the
state-of-the-art technologies.
1 Task Description
The task is to develop machine transliteration sys-
tem in one or more of the specified language pairs
being considered for the task. Each language pair
consists of a source and a target language. The
training and development data sets released for
each language pair are to be used for developing
a transliteration system in whatever way that the
participants find appropriate. At the evaluation
time, a test set of source names only would be
released, on which the participants are expected
to produce a ranked list of transliteration candi-
dates in another language (i.e. n-best translitera-
tions), and this will be evaluated using common
metrics. For every language pair the participants
must submit at least one run that uses only the
data provided by the NEWS workshop organisers
in a given language pair (designated as ?standard?
run, primary submission). Users may submit more
?stanrard? runs. They may also submit several
?non-standard? runs for each language pair that
?http://translit.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/news2010/
use other data than those provided by the NEWS
2010 workshop; such runs would be evaluated and
reported separately.

3 Participation
1. Registration (1 Feb 2010)
(a) NEWS Shared Task opens for registra-
tion.
(b) Prospective participants are to register to
the NEWS Workshop homepage.
2. Training & Development Data (19 Feb 2010)
(a) Registered participants are to obtain
training and development data from the
Shared Task organiser and/or the desig-
nated copyright owners of databases.
(b) All registered participants are required
to participate in the evaluation of at least
one language pair, submit the results and
a short paper and attend the workshop at
ACL 2010.
3. Evaluation Script (19 Feb 2010)
12
(a) A sample test set and expected user out-
put format are to be released.
(b) An evaluation script, which runs on the
above two, is to be released.
(c) The participants must make sure that
their output is produced in a way that
the evaluation script may run and pro-
duce the expected output.
(d) The same script (with held out test data
and the user outputs) would be used for
final evaluation.
4. Test data (13 Mar 2010)
(a) The test data would be released on 13
March 2010, and the participants have a
maximum of 7 days to submit their re-
sults in the expected format.
(b) One ?standard? run must be submit-
ted from every group on a given lan-
guage pair. Additional ?standard? runs
may be submitted, up to 4 ?standard?
runs in total. However, the partici-
pants must indicate one of the submit-
ted ?standard? runs as the ?primary sub-
mission?. The primary submission will
be used for the performance summary.
In addition to the ?standard? runs, more
?non-standard? runs may be submitted.
In total, maximum 8 runs (up to 4 ?stan-
dard? runs plus up to 4 ?non-standard?
runs) can be submitted from each group
on a registered language pair. The defi-
nition of ?standard? and ?non-standard?
runs is in Section 5.
(c) Any runs that are ?non-standard? must
be tagged as such.
(d) The test set is a list of names in source
language only. Every group will pro-
duce and submit a ranked list of translit-
eration candidates in another language
for each given name in the test set.
Please note that this shared task is a
?transliteration generation? task, i.e.,
given a name in a source language one
is supposed to generate one or more
transliterations in a target language. It
is not the task of ?transliteration discov-
ery?, i.e., given a name in the source lan-
guage and a set of names in the target
language evaluate how to find the ap-
propriate names from the target set that
are transliterations of the given source
name.
5. Results (27 Mar 2010)
(a) On 27 March 2010, the evaluation re-
sults would be announced and will be
made available on the Workshop web-
site.
(b) Note that only the scores (in respective
metrics) of the participating systems on
each language pairs would be published,
and no explicit ranking of the participat-
ing systems would be published.
(c) Note that this is a shared evaluation task
and not a competition; the results are
meant to be used to evaluate systems on
common data set with common metrics,
and not to rank the participating sys-
tems. While the participants can cite the
performance of their systems (scores on
metrics) from the workshop report, they
should not use any ranking information
in their publications.
(d) Furthermore, all participants should
agree not to reveal identities of other
participants in any of their publications
unless you get permission from the other
respective participants. By default, all
participants remain anonymous in pub-
lished results, unless they indicate oth-
erwise at the time of uploading their re-
sults. Note that the results of all systems
will be published, but the identities of
those participants that choose not to dis-
close their identity to other participants
will be masked. As a result, in this case,
your organisation name will still appear
in the web site as one of participants, but
it will not be linked explicitly to your re-
sults.
6. Short Papers on Task (5 Apr 2010)
(a) Each submitting site is required to sub-
mit a 4-page system paper (short paper)
for its submissions, including their ap-
proach, data used and the results on ei-
ther test set or development set or by n-
fold cross validation on training set.
(b) The review of the system papers will be
done to improve paper quality and read-
ability and make sure the authors? ideas
13
and methods can be understood by the
workshop participants. We are aiming
at accepting all system papers, and se-
lected ones will be presented orally in
the NEWS 2010 workshop.
(c) All registered participants are required
to register and attend the workshop to
introduce your work.
(d) All paper submission and review will be
managed electronically through https://
www.softconf.com/acl2010/NEWS.
4 Language Pairs
The tasks are to transliterate personal names or
place names from a source to a target language as
summarised in Table 1. NEWS 2010 Shared Task
offers 12 evaluation subtasks, among them ChEn
and ThEn are the back-transliteration of EnCh and
EnTh tasks respectively. NEWS 2010 releases
training, development and testing data for each of
the language pairs. NEWS 2010 continues some
language pairs that were evaluated in NEWS 2009.
In such cases, the training and development data in
the release of NEWS 2010 may overlap with those
in NEWS 2009. However, the test data in NEWS
2010 are entirely new.
The names given in the training sets for Chi-
nese, Japanese, Korean and Thai languages are
Western names and their respective translitera-
tions; the Japanese Name (in English)? Japanese
Kanji data set consists only of native Japanese
names; the Arabic data set consists only of native
Arabic names. The Indic data set (Hindi, Tamil,
Kannada, Bangla) consists of a mix of Indian and
Western names.
Examples of transliteration:
English? Chinese
Timothy????
English? Japanese Katakana
Harrington??????
English? Korean Hangul
Bennett ? ??
Japanese name in English? Japanese Kanji
Akihiro???
English? Hindi
English? Tamil
English? Kannada
Arabic? Arabic name in English
? 
Khalid
????
5 Standard Databases
Training Data (Parallel)
Paired names between source and target lan-
guages; size 5K ? 32K.
Training Data is used for training a basic
transliteration system.
Development Data (Parallel)
Paired names between source and target lan-
guages; size 2K ? 6K.
Development Data is in addition to the Train-
ing data, which is used for system fine-tuning
of parameters in case of need. Participants
are allowed to use it as part of training data.
Testing Data
Source names only; size 2K ? 3K.
This is a held-out set, which would be used
for evaluating the quality of the translitera-
tions.
1. Participants will need to obtain licenses from
the respective copyright owners and/or agree
to the terms and conditions of use that are
given on the downloading website (Li et al,
2004; MSRI, 2010; CJKI, 2010). NEWS
2010 will provide the contact details of each
individual database. The data would be pro-
vided in Unicode UTF-8 encoding, in XML
format; the results are expected to be sub-
mitted in UTF-8 encoding in XML format.
The XML formats details are available in Ap-
pendix A.
2. The data are provided in 3 sets as described
above.
3. Name pairs are distributed as-is, as provided
by the respective creators.
(a) While the databases are mostly man-
ually checked, there may be still in-
consistency (that is, non-standard usage,
region-specific usage, errors, etc.) or in-
completeness (that is, not all right varia-
tions may be covered).
(b) The participants may use any method to
further clean up the data provided.

i. If they are cleaned up manually, we
appeal that such data be provided
back to the organisers for redistri-
bution to all the participating groups
in that language pair; such sharing
benefits all participants, and further
ensures that the evaluation provides
normalisation with respect to data
quality.
ii. If automatic cleanup were used,
such cleanup would be considered a
part of the system fielded, and hence
not required to be shared with all
participants.
4. Standard Runs We expect that the partici-
pants to use only the data (parallel names)
provided by the Shared Task for translitera-
tion task for a ?standard? run to ensure a fair
evaluation. One such run (using only the data
provided by the shared task) is mandatory for
all participants for a given language pair that
they participate in.
5. Non-standard Runs If more data (either par-
allel names data or monolingual data) were
used, then all such runs using extra data must
be marked as ?non-standard?. For such ?non-
standard? runs, it is required to disclose the
size and characteristics of the data used in the
system paper.
6. A participant may submit a maximum of 8
runs for a given language pair (including the
mandatory 1 ?standard? run marked as ?pri-
mary submission?).
6 Paper Format
Paper submissions to NEWS 2010 should follow
the ACL 2010 paper submission policy, includ-
ing paper format, blind review policy and title and
author format convention. Full papers (research
paper) are in two-column format without exceed-
ing eight (8) pages of content plus one extra page
for references and short papers (task paper) are
also in two-column format without exceeding four
(4) pages, including references. Submission must
conform to the official ACL 2010 style guidelines.
For details, please refer to the ACL 2010 website2.
7 Evaluation Metrics
We plan to measure the quality of the translitera-
tion task using the following 4 metrics. We accept
up to 10 output candidates in a ranked list for each
input entry.
Since a given source name may have multiple
correct target transliterations, all these alternatives
are treated equally in the evaluation. That is, any
of these alternatives are considered as a correct
transliteration, and the first correct transliteration
in the ranked list is accepted as a correct hit.
The following notation is further assumed:
2http://acl2010.org/authors.html
15
N : Total number of names (source
words) in the test set
ni : Number of reference transliterations
for i-th name in the test set (ni ? 1)
ri,j : j-th reference transliteration for i-th
name in the test set
ci,k : k-th candidate transliteration (system
output) for i-th name in the test set
(1 ? k ? 10)
Ki : Number of candidate transliterations
produced by a transliteration system
1. Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC) Also
known as Word Error Rate, it measures correct-
ness of the first transliteration candidate in the can-
didate list produced by a transliteration system.
ACC = 1 means that all top candidates are cor-
rect transliterations i.e. they match one of the ref-
erences, and ACC = 0 means that none of the top
candidates are correct.
ACC =
1
N
N?
i=1
{
1 if ? ri,j : ri,j = ci,1;
0 otherwise
}
(1)
2. Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-score) The
mean F-score measures how different, on average,
the top transliteration candidate is from its closest
reference. F-score for each source word is a func-
tion of Precision and Recall and equals 1 when the
top candidate matches one of the references, and
0 when there are no common characters between
the candidate and any of the references.
Precision and Recall are calculated based on the
length of the Longest Common Subsequence be-
tween a candidate and a reference:
LCS(c, r) =
1
2
(|c|+ |r| ? ED(c, r)) (2)
where ED is the edit distance and |x| is the length
of x. For example, the longest common subse-
quence between ?abcd? and ?afcde? is ?acd? and
its length is 3. The best matching reference, that
is, the reference for which the edit distance has
the minimum, is taken for calculation. If the best
matching reference is given by
ri,m = argmin
j
(ED(ci,1, ri,j)) (3)
then Recall, Precision and F-score for i-th word
are calculated as
Ri =
LCS(ci,1, ri,m)
|ri,m|
(4)
Pi =
LCS(ci,1, ri,m)
|ci,1|
(5)
Fi = 2
Ri ? Pi
Ri + Pi
(6)
? The length is computed in distinct Unicode
characters.
? No distinction is made on different character
types of a language (e.g., vowel vs. conso-
nants vs. combining diereses? etc.)
3. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Measures
traditional MRR for any right answer produced by
the system, from among the candidates. 1/MRR
tells approximately the average rank of the correct
transliteration. MRR closer to 1 implies that the
correct answer is mostly produced close to the top
of the n-best lists.
RRi =
{
minj 1j if ?ri,j , ci,k : ri,j = ci,k;
0 otherwise
}
(7)
MRR =
1
N
N?
i=1
RRi (8)
4. MAPref Measures tightly the precision in the
n-best candidates for i-th source name, for which
reference transliterations are available. If all of
the references are produced, then the MAP is 1.
Let?s denote the number of correct candidates for
the i-th source word in k-best list as num(i, k).
MAPref is then given by
MAPref =
