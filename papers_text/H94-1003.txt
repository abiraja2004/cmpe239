ABSTRACT 
We describe the design of Comlex Syntax, a computational lexicon 
providing detailed syntactic information for approximately 38,000 
EnglJish headwords. We consider the types of errors which arise in 
creagng such a lexicon, and how such errors can be measured and 
controlled. 
1. Goals 
The goal of the Comlex Syntax project is to create a moderately- 
broad-coverage lexicon recording the syntactic features of English 
words for purposes of computational language analysis. This dic- 
tionary is being developed at New York University and is to be 
distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium, and to be freely us- 
able for both research and commercial purposes by members of the 
Consortium. 
In order to meet the needs of a wide range of analyzers, we have 
included a rich set of syntactic features and have aimed to charac- 
terize these features in a relatively theory-neutral way. In particular, 
the feature set is more detailed than those of the major commer- 
cial dictionaries, uch as the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 
(OALD) \[4\] and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
(LDOCE) \[8\], which have been widely used as a source of lexical 
information in language analyzers? In addition, we have aimed 
to be more comprehensive in capturing features, and in particular 
subcategorization features, than commercial dictionaries. 
2. Structure 
The structure of COMLEX has been discussed at length in our report 
to the 1993 HLT Workshop so we will briefly touch on the details 
of our dictionary entry. The major classes (adjectives, nouns and 
verbs) are marked for features and complements ( ubcategorization 
frames), examples of which can be seen in Figure 1. 
Nouns have 9 possible features and 9 possible complements; adjec- 
tives have 7 features and 14 complements; and verbs have 5 features 
and 92 complements. Figure 2 shows some actual dictionary entries, 
including some entries for adverbs and prepositions. 
In order to insure the completeness of our codes, we studied the cod- 
ing employed by several other major lexicons, including tire Brandeis 
Verb Lexicon 2, the ACQUILEX Project \[10\], the NYU Linguistic 
String Project \[9\], the OALD, and the LDOCE, and, whenever fea- 
sible, have sought o incorporate distinctions made in any of these

tionaries, we have prepared mappings from COMLEX classes to those of 
several other dictionaries.

dictionaries. The names for the different complement types are based 
on the conventions used in the the Brandeis Verb Lexicon.The nota- 
tion indicates the type and order of the elements (NP = noun phrase, 
PP = prepositional phrase, NP-PP = a noun phrase followed by a 
prepositional phrase, :pval = the selected prepositions). 
The subcategofization types are defined by frames. These frames 
which appear in our reference manual (see Figure 3) include the 
constituent structure :es, the grammatical structure :gs, optional 
:foaturo$ and one or more examples :ox. The features in the sub- 
categorization frames are not those in the dictionary but refer to the 
control or raising properties of the verb where applicable. In par- 
ticular, they capture four different ypes of control: subject control, 
object control, variable control, and arbitrary control. Furthermore, 
the notation allows us to indicate that a verb may have different con- 
trol features for different complement s ructures, or even for different 
prepositions within the complement. We record, for example, that 
"blame ... on" involves arbitrary control ("He blamed the problem 
on going too fast."), whereas "blame for" involves object control 
("He blamed John for going too fast."). 
There are two complements represented by the frames in Figure 
3, possing and ing-sz, possing stands for a frame group which 
includes two frames *possing (where the subject of the gerund is 
present) and *ing-ae (where the subjectis interpreted tobe arbitrary). 
A verb which is assigned possing must be able to occur in both of 
these frames, ing-sc also stands for a frame group. It includes 
bo-ing-s? and *possing. Here the subject of the gerund must be the 
same as the surface subject and the possessive subject of *possing 
will be co-referential with the surface subject. 
3. Methods 
Our basic approach is to create an initial lexicon manually and then 
to use a variety of resources, both commercial nd corpus-derived, to 
refine this lexicon. Although methods have been developed over the 
last few years for automatically identifying some subcategorization 
constraints through corpus analysis \[2,5\], these methods are still 
limited in the range of distinctions they can identify and their ability 
to deal with low-frequency words. Consequently we have chosen to 
use manual entry for creation of our initial dictionary. 
The entry of lexical information is being performed by four graduate 
linguistics tudents, referred to as elves ("elf" = enterer of lexical 
features). The elves are provided with a menu-basedinterface coded 
in Common Lisp using the Garnet GUI package, and running on 
Sun workstations. This interface also provides access to a large 
text corpus; as a word is being entered, instances of the word can 
be viewed in one of the windows. Elves rely on citations from 
the corpus, definitions and citations from any of several printed 
8 
Noun feature NUNIT: a noun which can occur in a quantifier-noun measure expression 
ex: "two FOOT long pipe"/"a pipe which is two FEET in length" 
Noun complement NOUN-THAT-S: the noun complement is a full sentence 
ex:"the assumption that he will go to school (is wrong.)" 
Adj feature ATTRIBUTIVE: an adjective that occurs only attributively (ie before the 
noun) and never predicatively (after "be") 
ex: "The LONE man rode through the desert"/*"the man was lone." 
Adj complement ADJ-FOR-TO-INF: includes three infinitival complements of adjectives 
ex: "it is PRACTICAL for Evan to go to school." (extrap-adj-for-to-inf) 
''the race was easy for her to win." (extrap-adj-for-to-inf-np-omit) 
"Joan was kind to invite me." (extrap-adj-for-to-inf-rs) 
Verb feature VMOTION: a verb which occurs with a locative adverbial complement. 
ex: "he ran in" (which may permute to "in he ran.") 
Verb complement: NP a verb which takes a direct object noun phrase. 
ex: "he ran a gambling den."

dictionaries and their own linguistic intuitions in assigning features 
to words. 
Entry of the initial dictionary began in April 1993. To date, entries 
have be, en created for all the nouns and adjectives, and 60% of the 
verbs3; the initial dictionary is scheduled for completion i  the spring 
of 1994. 
We expect to check this dictionary against several sources. We 
intend to compare the manual subeategorizations for verbs against 
those in the OALD, and would be pleased to make comparisons 
against other broad-coverage dictionaries if those can be made avail- 
able for this purpose. We also intend to make comparisons against 
several corpus-derived lists: at the very least, with verb/preposition 
and verb/particle pairs with high mutualinformation \[3\] and, if possi- 
ble, with the results of recently-developed procedures for extracting 
subcategorization frames from corpora \[2,5\]. While this corpus- 
derived information may not be detailed or accurate nough for 
fully-automated lexicon creation, it should be most valuable as a 
basis for comparisons. 
4. Types and Sources of Error 
As part of the process of refining the dictionary and assuring its qual- 
ity, we have spent considerable resources on reviewing dictionary 
entries and on occasion have had sections coded by two or even four 
of the elves. This process has allowed us to make some analysis of 
the sources and types of error in the lexicon, and how they might be 
reduced. We can divide the sources of error and inconsistency into 
four classes: 
1. errors of elassUieation: where an instance of a word is im- 
properly analyzed, and in particular where the words follow- 
ing a verb are not properly identified with regard to comple- 
ment type. Specific types of problems include misclassify- 
ing adjuncts as arguments (or vice versa) and identifying the 
wrong control features. Our primary defenses against such 
errors have been a steady refinement of the feature descrip- 
tions in our manual and regular group review sessions with all 
the elves. In particular, we have developed etailed criteria 
for making adjunct/argument distinctions \[6\]. 
A preliminary study, conducted on examples (drawn at ran- 
dom from a corpus not used for our concordance) of verbs 
beginning with "j", indicated that elves were consistent 93% 
to 94% of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinctions 
following our criteria and, when they were consistent in ar- 
gument/adjunct labeling, rarely disagreed on the subcatego- 
rization. In more than half of the cases where there was dis- 
agreement, the elves separately flagged these as difficult, am- 
biguous, or figurative uses of the verbs (and therefore would 
probably not use them as the basis for assigning lexical fea- 
tures). The agreement rate for examples which were not 
flagged was 96% to 98%. 
2. omitted features: where an elf omits a feature because it is 
not suggested by an example in the concordance, a citation 
in the dictionary, or the elf's introspection. In order to get 
an estimate of the magnitude of this problem we decided to 
establish ameasure of coverage or "recall" for the subcatego- 
rization features assigned by our elves. To do this, we tagged

lexicon. 
the first 150 "j" verbs from a randomly selected corpus from a 
part of the San Diego Mercury which was not included in our 
concordance and then compared the dictionary entries created 
by our lexicographers against he tugged corpus. The results 
of this comparison are shown in Figure 4. 
The "Complements only" is the percentage of instances in the 
corpus covered by the subcategorization tugs assigned by the 
elves and does not include the identification of any prepo- 
sitions or adverbs. The "Complements only" would corre- 
spond roughly to the type of information provided by OALD 
and LDOCE 4. The "Complements + Prepositions/Particles" 
column includes all the features, that is it considers the 
correct identification of the complement plus the specific 
prepositions and adverbs required by certain complements. 
The two columns of figures under "Complements + Prepo- 
sitions/Particles" how the results with and without the enu- 
meration of directional prepositions. 
We have recently changed our approach to the classificaton 
of verbs (like "run", "send", "jog", "walk", "jump") which 
take a long list of directional prepositions, by providing our 
entering program with a P-DIR option on the preposition 
list. This option will automatically assign a list of directional 
prepositions to the verb and thus will save time and eliminate 
errors Of missing prepositions. Figure 5 shows the dictionary 
entry for"jump", taken from the union of the four elves. If you 
note the large number of directional prepositions listed under 
PP (prepositional phrase), you can see how easy it would be 
for a single elf to miss one or more. The addition of P-DIR 
has eliminated that problem. 
In some cases this approach will provide a preposition list 
that is a little rich for a given verb but we have decided to 
err on the side of a slight overgeneration rather than risk 
missing any prepositions which actually occur. As you can 
see, the removal of the P-DIRs from consideration improves 
the individual elf scores. 
The elf union score is the union of the lexical entries for all 
four elves. Theseare certainly numbers to be proud of, but 
realistically, having the verbs done four separate times is not 
practical. However, in our original proposal we stated that 
because of the complexity of the verb entries we would like 
to have them done twice. As can be seen in Figure 6, with 
two passes we succeed in raising individual percentages in all 
cases. 
We would like to make clear that even in the two cases where 
our individual lexicographers miss 18% and 13% of the com- 
plements, there was only one instance in which this might 
have resulted in the inability to parse a sentence. This was 
a missing intransitive. Otherwise, the missed complements 
would have been analyzed as adjuncts ince they were a com- 
bination ofprepositionalphrases andadverbials with one case 
of a subordinate conjunction "as". 
We endeavored to make a comparison with LDOCE on the 
measurement. This was a bit difficult since LDOCE lacks 
some complements we have and combines others, not always 
consistently. For instance, our PP roughly corresponds to ei- 
ther L9 (our PP/ADVP) or prep/adv + T1 (e.g. "on" + T1) 
(our PP/PART-NP) but in some cases a preposition is men- 
tioned but the verb is classified as intransitive. The straight 
forward comparison has LDOCE finding 73% of the tagged 
4LDOCE does provide some prepositions and particles.

that LDOCE seems to be lacking (PART-NP-PP, P-POSSING,

We have adopted two lines of defense against the problem 
of omitted features. First, critical entries (particularly high 
frequency verbs) will be done independently by two or more 
elves. Second, we are developing a more balanced corpus for 
the elves to consult. Recent studies (e.g., \[1\]) confirm our 
observations that features uch as subcategorization patterns 
may differ substantially between corpora. We began with a 
corpus from a single newspaper (San Jose Mercury News), 
but have since added the Brown corpus, several literary works 
from the Library of America, scientific abstracts from the U.S. 
Department of Energy, and an additional newspaper (the Wall 
Street Journal). In extending the corpus, we have limited our- 
selves to texts which would be readily available to members 
of the Linguistic Data Consortium. 
excess features: when an elf assigns a spurious feature 
through incorrect extrapolation r analogy from available x- 
amples or introspection. Because of our desire to obtain rel- 
atively complete feature sets, even for infrequent verbs, we 
have permitted elves to extrapolate from the citations found. 
Such a process is bound to be less certain than the assignment 
of features from extant examples. However, this problem 
does not appear to be very severe. A review of the "j" verb 
enlries produced by all four elves indicates that the fraction 
of spurious entries ranges from 2% to 6%. 
fuzzy features: feature assignmentis defined in terms of the 
acceptability of words in particular syntactic frames. Accept- 
ability, however, is often not absolute but a matter of degree. 
A verb may occur primarily with particular complements, but 
will be "acceptable" with others. 
This problem is compounded bywords which take on partic- 
ular features only in special contexts. Thus, we don't ordi- 
narily think of"dead" as being gradable (*"Fred is more dead 
than Mary."), but we do say "deader than a door nail". It is 
also compounded by our decision ot to make sense distinc- 
tions initially. For example, many words which are countable 
(require a determiner before the singular form) also have a 
generic sense in which the determiner is not required (*"Fred 
bought apple." but "Apple is a wonderful f avor."). For each 
such problematic feature we have prepared guidelines for the 
elves, but these still require considerable discretion on their 
part. 
These problems have emphasized for us the importance of devel- 
oping a tagged corpus in conjunction with the dictionary, so that 
frequency of occurrence of a feature (and frequency by text type) 
will be available. We are planning to do such tagging beginning in
March 1994, in parallel with the completion ofour initial dictionary. 
Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Brown corpus, in order 
to be able to correlate our tagging with the word sense tagging being 
done by the WordNet group on the same corpus \[7\].
