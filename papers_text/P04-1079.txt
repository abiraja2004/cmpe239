Abstract 
We present the results of an experiment 
on extending the automatic method of 
Machine Translation evaluation BLUE 
with statistical weights for lexical items, 
such as tf.idf scores. We show that this 
extension gives additional information 
about evaluated texts; in particular it al-
lows us to measure translation Adequacy, 
which, for statistical MT systems, is often 
overestimated by the baseline BLEU 
method. The proposed model uses a sin-
gle human reference translation, which 
increases the usability of the proposed 
method for practical purposes. The model 
suggests a linguistic interpretation which 
relates frequency weights and human in-
tuition about translation Adequacy and 
Fluency. 
1. Introduction 
Automatic methods for evaluating different as-
pects of MT quality ? such as Adequacy, Fluency 
and Informativeness ? provide an alternative to 
an expensive and time-consuming process of 
human MT evaluation. They are intended to yield 
scores that correlate with human judgments of 
translation quality and enable systems (machine 
or human) to be ranked on this basis. Several 
such automatic methods have been proposed in 
recent years. Some of them use human reference 
translations, e.g., the BLEU method (Papineni et 
al., 2002), which is based on comparison of 
N-gram models in MT output and in a set of hu-
man reference translations. 
However, a serious problem for the BLEU 
method is the lack of a model for relative impor-
tance of matched and mismatched items. Words 
in text usually carry an unequal informational 
load, and as a result are of differing importance 
for translation. It is reasonable to expect that the 
choices of right translation equivalents for certain 
key items, such as expressions denoting principal 
events, event participants and relations in a text 
are more important in the eyes of human evalua-
tors then choices of function words and a syntac-
tic perspective for sentences. Accurate rendering 
of these key items by an MT system boosts the 
quality of translation. Therefore, at least for 
evaluation of translation Adequacy (Fidelity), the 
proper choice of translation equivalents for im-
portant pieces of information should count more 
than the choice of words which are used for 
structural purposes and without a clear translation 
equivalent in the source text. (The latter may be 
more important for Fluency evaluation). 
The problem of different significance of N-
gram matches is related to the issue of legitimate 
variation in human translations, when certain 
words are less stable than others across inde-
pendently produced human translations. BLEU 
accounts for legitimate translation variation by 
using a set of several human reference transla-
tions, which are believed to be representative of 
several equally acceptable ways of translating 
any source segment. This is motivated by the 
need not to penalise deviations from the set of N-
grams in a single reference, although the re-
quirement of multiple human references makes 
automatic evaluation more expensive. 
However, the ?significance? problem is not di-
rectly addressed by the BLEU method. On the 
one hand, the matched items that are present in 
several human references receive the same 
weights as items found in just one of the refer-
ences. On the other hand the model of legitimate 
translation variation cannot fully accommodate 
the issue of varying degrees of ?salience? for 
matched lexical items, since alternative syn-
onymic translation equivalents may also be 
highly significant for an adequate translation 
from the human perspective (Babych and Hart-
ley, 2004). Therefore it is reasonable to suggest 
that introduction of a model which approximates 
intuitions about the significance of the matched 
N-grams will improve the correlation between 
automatically computed MT evaluation scores 
and human evaluation scores for translation Ade-
quacy. 
In this paper we present the result of an ex-
periment on augmenting BLEU N-gram compari-
son with statistical weight coefficients which 
capture a word?s salience within a given docu-
ment: the standard tf.idf measure used in the vec-
tor-space model for Information Retrieval (Salton 
and Leck, 1968) and the S-score proposed for 
evaluating MT output corpora for the purposes of 
Information Extraction (Babych et al, 2003). 
Both scores are computed for each term in each 
of the 100 human reference translations from 
French into English available in DARPA-94 MT 
evaluation corpus (White et al, 1994). 
The proposed weighted N-gram model for MT 
evaluation is tested on a set of translations by 
four different MT systems available in the 
DARPA corpus, and is compared with the results 
of the baseline BLEU method with respect to 
their correlation with human evaluation scores.  
The scores produced by the N-gram model 
with tf.idf and S-Score weights are shown to be 
consistent with baseline BLEU evaluation results 
for Fluency and outperform the BLEU scores for 
Adequacy (where the correlation for the S-score 
weighting is higher). We also show that the 
weighted model may still be reliably used if there 
is only one human reference translation for an 
evaluated text. 
Besides saving cost, the ability to dependably 
work with a single human translation has an addi-
tional advantage: it is now possible to create Re-
call-based evaluation measures for MT, which 
has been problematic for evaluation with multiple 
reference translations, since only one of the 
choices from the reference set is used in transla-
tion (Papineni et al 2002:314). Notably, Recall 
of weighted N-grams is found to be a good esti-
mation of human judgements about translation 
Adequacy. Using weighted N-grams is essential 
for predicting Adequacy, since correlation of Re-
call for non-weighted N-grams is much lower. 
It is possible that other automatic methods 
which use human translations as a reference may 
also benefit from an introduction of an explicit 
model for term significance, since so far these 
methods also implicitly assume that all words are 
equally important in human translation, and use 
all of them, e.g., for measuring edit distances 
(Akiba et al 2001; 2003).  
The weighted N-gram model has been imple-
mented as an MT evaluation toolkit (which in-
cludes a Perl script, example files and 
documentation). It computes evaluation scores 
with tf.idf and S-score weights for translation 
Adequacy and Fluency. The toolkit is available at 
http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/bogdan/evalMT.html
2. Set-up of the experiment 
The experiment used French?English transla-
tions available in the DARPA-94 MT evaluation 
corpus. The corpus contains 100 French news 
texts (each text is about 350 words long) trans-
lated into English by 5 different MT systems: 
?Systran?, ?Reverso?, ?Globalink?, ?Metal?, 
?Candide? and scored by human evaluators; there 
are no human scores for ?Reverso?, which was 
added to the corpus on a later stage. The corpus 
also contains 2 independent human translations 
of each text. Human evaluation scores are avail-
able for each of the 400 texts translated by the 4 
MT systems for 3 parameters of translation qual-
ity: ?Adequacy?, ?Fluency? and ?Informative-
ness?. The Adequacy (Fidelity) scores are given 
on a 5-point scale by comparing MT with a hu-
man reference translation. The Adequacy pa-
rameter captures how much of the original 
content of a text is conveyed, regardless of how 
grammatically imperfect the output might be. 
The Fluency scores (also given on a 5-point 
scale) determine intelligibility of MT without 
reference to the source text, i.e., how grammati-
cal and stylistically natural the translation ap-
pears to be. The Informativeness scores (which 
we didn?t use for our experiment) determine 
whether there is enough information in MT out-
put to enable evaluators to answer multiple-
choice questions on its content (White, 2003:237) 
In the first stage of the experiment, each of the 
two sets of human translations was used to com-
pute tf.idf and S-scores for each word in each of 
the 100 texts. The tf.idf score was calculated as: 
tf.idf(i,j) = (1 + log (tfi,j)) log (N / dfi), 
if tfi,j ? 1; where:  
? tfi,j is the number of occurrences of the 
word wi in the document dj; 
? dfi is the number of documents in the cor-
pus where the word wi occurs; 
?  N is the total number of documents in the 
corpus. 
The S-score was calculated as: ( )
)(
)()(),( /)(log),(
icorp
iidoccorpjidoc
P
NdfNPP
jiS
???= ?  
where: 
? Pdoc(i,j) is the relative frequency of the 
word in the text; (?Relative frequency? is 
the number of tokens of this word-type 
divided by the total number of tokens). 
? Pcorp-doc(i) is the relative frequency of the 
same word in the rest of the corpus, with-
out this text; 
? (N ? df(i)) / N is the proportion of texts in 
the corpus, where this word does not oc-
cur (number of texts, where it is not 
found,  divided by number of texts in the 
corpus); 
? Pcorp(i) is the relative frequency of the 
word in the whole corpus, including this 
particular text.  
In the second stage we carried out N-gram based 
MT evaluation, measuring Precision and Recall 
of N-grams in MT output using a single human 
reference translation. N-gram counts were ad-
justed with the tf.idf weights and S-scores for 
every matched word. The following procedure 
was used to integrate the S-scores / tf.idf scores 
for a lexical item into N-gram counts. For every 
word in a given text which received an S-score 
and tf.idf score on the basis of the human refer-
ence corpus, all counts for the N-grams contain-
ing this word are increased by the value of the 
respective score (not just by 1, as in the baseline 
BLEU approach). 
The original matches used for BLEU and the 
weighted matches are both calculated. The fol-
lowing changes have been made to the Perl script 
of the BLEU tool: apart from the operator which 
increases counts for every matched N-gram $ngr 
by 1, i.e.: 
$ngr .= $words[$i+$j] . " "; 
$$hashNgr{$ngr}++;  
the following code was introduced: 
[?] 
$WORD = $words[$i+$j]; 
$WEIGHT = 0; 
if(exists 
  $WordWeight{$TxtN}{$WORD}){ 
    $WEIGHT= 
     $WordWeight{$TxtN}{$WORD}; 
} 
 
$ngr .= $words[$i+$j] . " "; 
$$hashNgr{$ngr}++; 
 
$$hashNgrWEIGHTED{$ngr}+= $WEIGHT; 
[?] 
? where the hash data structure:  
   $WordWeight{$TxtN}{$WORD}=$WEIGHT 
represents the table of tf.idf scores or S-scores for 
words in every text in the corpus. 
The weighted N-gram evaluation scores of 
Precision, Recall and F-measure may be pro-
duced for a segment, for a text or for a corpus of 
translations generated by an MT system. 
In the third stage of the experiment the 
weighted Precision and Recall scores were tested 
for correlation with human scores for the same 
texts and compared to the results of similar tests 
for standard BLEU evaluation. 
Finally we addressed the question whether the 
proposed MT evaluation method allows us to use 
a single human reference translation reliably. In 
order to assess the stability of the weighted 
evaluation scores with a single reference, two 
runs of the experiment were carried out. The first 
run used the ?Reference? human translation, 
while the second run used the ?Expert? human 
translation (each time a single reference transla-
tion was used). The scores for both runs were 
compared using a standard deviation measure.   
3. The results of the MT evaluation with 
frequency weights 
With respect to evaluating MT systems, the cor-
relation for the weighted N-gram model was 
found to be stronger, for both Adequacy and Flu-
ency, the improvement being highest for Ade-
quacy. These results are due to the fact that the 
weighted N-gram model gives much more accu-
rate predictions about the statistical MT system 
?Candide?, whereas the standard BLEU approach 
tends to over-estimate its performance for trans-
lation Adequacy. 
Table 1 present the baseline results for non-
weighted Precision, Recall and F-score. It shows 
the following figures: 
? Human evaluation scores for Adequacy and 
Fluency (the mean scores for all texts produced 
by each MT system);  
? BLEU scores produced using 2 human refer-
ence translations and the default script settings 
(N-gram size = 4); 
? Precision, Recall and F-score for the weighted 
N-gram model produced with 1 human refer-
ence translation and N-gram size = 4. 
? Pearson?s correlation coefficient r for Preci-
sion, Recall and F-score correlated with human 
scores for Adequacy and Fluency r(2) (with 2 
degrees of freedom) for the sets which include 
scores for the 4 MT systems. 
The scores at the top of each cell show the results 
for the first run of the experiment, which used the 
?Reference? human translation; the scores at the 
bottom of the cells represent the results for the 
second run with the ?Expert? human translation.

Table 3. BLEU vs S-score weights. 
 
It can be seen from the table that there is a 
strong positive correlation between the baseline 
BLEU scores and human scores for Fluency: 
r(2)=0.9807, p <0.05. However, the correlation 
with Adequacy is much weaker and is not statis-
tically significant: r(2)= 0.5918, p >0.05. The 
most serious problem for BLEU is predicting 
scores for the statistical MT system Candide, 
which was judged to produce relatively fluent, 
but largely inadequate translation. For other MT 
systems (developed with the knowledge-based 
MT architecture) the scores for Adequacy and 
Fluency are consistent with each other: more flu-
ent translations are also more adequate. BLEU 
scores go in line with Candide?s Fluency scores, 
but do not account for its Adequacy scores. 
When Candide is excluded from the evaluation 
set, r correlation goes up, but it is still lower than 
the correlation for Fluency and remains statisti-
cally insignificant: r(1)=0.9608, p > 0.05. There-
fore, the baseline BLEU approach fails to 
consistently predict scores for Adequacy. 
Correlation figures between non-weighted N-
gram counts and human scores are similar to the 
results for BLEU: the highest and statistically 
significant correlation is between the F-score and 
Fluency: r(2)=0.9836, p<0.05, r(2)=0.9869, 
p<0.01, and there is somewhat smaller and statis-
tically significant correlation with Precision. This 
confirms the need to use modified Precision in 
the BLEU method that also in certain respect in-
tegrates Recall. 
The proposed weighted N-gram model outper-
forms BLEU and non-weighted N-gram evalua-
tion in its ability to predict Adequacy scores: 
weighted Recall scores have much stronger cor-
relation with Adequacy (which for MT-only 
evaluation is still statistically insignificant at the 
level p<0.05, but come very close to that point: 
t=3.729 and t=4.108; the required value for 
p<0.05 is t=4.303). 
Correlation figures for S-score-based weights 
are higher than for tf.idf weights (S-score: r(2)= 
0.9069, p > 0.05; r(2)= 0.9215, p > 0.05, tf.idf 
score: r(2)= 0.8354, p >0.05; r(2)= 0.8667, p 
>0.05). 
The improvement in the accuracy of evalua-
tion for the weighted N-gram model can be illus-
trated by the following example of translating the 
French sentence: 
ORI-French: Les trente-huit chefs d'entre-
prise mis en examen dans le dossier ont d?j? 
fait l'objet d'auditions, mais trois d'entre eux 
ont ?t? confront?s, mercredi, dans la foul?e de 
la confrontation "politique". 
English translations of this sentence by the 
knowledge-based system Systran and statistical 
MT system Candide have an equal number of 
matched unigrams (highlighted in italic), there-
fore conventional unigram Precision and Recall 
scores are the same for both systems. However, 
for each translation two of the matched unigrams 
are different (underlined) and receive different 
frequency weights (shown in brackets): 
MT ?Systran?:  
The thirty-eight heads (tf.idf=4.605; S=4.614) of 
undertaking put in examination in the file already 
were the subject of hearings, but three of them 
were confronted, Wednesday, in the tread of "po-
litical" confrontation (tf.idf=5.937; S=3.890). 
Human translation ?Expert?:  
The thirty-eight heads of companies ques-
tioned in the case had already been heard, but 
three of them were brought together Wednes-
day following the "political" confrontation. 
MT ?Candide?:  
The thirty-eight counts of company put into con-
sideration in the case (tf.idf=3.719; S=2.199) al-
ready had (tf.idf=0.562; S=0.000) the object of 
hearings, but three of them were checked, 
Wednesday, in the path of confrontal "political." 
(In the human translation the unigrams matched 
by the Systran output sentence are in italic, those 
matched by the Candide sentence are in bold). 
It can be seen from this example that the uni-
grams matched by Systran have higher term fre-
quency weights (both tf.idf and S-scores):  
heads (tf.idf=4.605;S=4.614)  
confrontation (tf.idf=5.937;S=3.890)
The output sentence of Candide instead 
matched less salient unigrams: 
case (tf.idf=3.719;S=2.199)
had (tf.idf=0.562;S=0.000)  
Therefore for the given sentence weighted uni-
gram Recall (i.e., the ability to avoid under-
generation of salient unigrams) is higher for 
Systran than for Candide (Table 4): 
 Systran Candide 
R 0.6538 0.6538 
R * tf.idf 0.5332 0.4211 
R * S-score 0.5517 0.3697 
   
P 0.5484 0.5484 
P * tf.idf 0.7402 0.9277 
P * S-score 0.7166 0.9573 
Table 4. Recall, Precision, and weighted scores  
 
Weighted Recall scores capture the intuition that 
the translation generated by Systran is more ade-
quate than the one generated by Candide, since it 
preserves more important pieces of information. 
On the other hand, weighted Precision scores 
are higher for Candide. This is due to the fact that 
Systran over-generates (doesn?t match in the hu-
man translation) much more ?exotic?, unordinary 
words, which on average have higher cumulative 
salience scores, e.g., undertaking, exami-
nation, confronted, tread ? vs. the 
corresponding words ?over-generated? by Can-
dide: company, consideration, 
checked, path. In some respect higher 
weighted precision can be interpreted as higher 
Fluency of the Candide?s output sentence, which 
intuitively is perceived as sounding more natu-
rally (although not making much sense). 
On the level of corpus statistics the weighted 
Recall scores go in line with Adequacy, and 
weighted Precision scores (as well as the Preci-
sion-based BLEU scores) ? with Fluency, which 
confirms such interpretation of weighted Preci-
sion and Recall scores in the example above. On 
the other hand, Precision-based scores and non-
weighted Recall scores fail to capture Adequacy. 
The improvement in correlation for weighted 
Recall scores with Adequacy is achieved by re-
ducing overestimation for the Candide system, 
moving its scores closer to human judgements 
about its quality in this respect. However, this is 
not completely achieved: although in terms of 
Recall weighted by the S-scores Candide is cor-
rectly ranked below MS (and not ahead of it, as 
with the BLEU scores), it is still slightly ahead of 
Globalink, contrary to human evaluation results. 
For both methods ? BLEU and the Weighted 
N-gram evaluation ? Adequacy is found to be 
harder to predict than Fluency. This is due to the 
fact that there is no good linguistic model of 
translation adequacy which can be easily formal-
ised. The introduction of S-score weights may be 
a useful step towards developing such a model, 
since correlation scores with Adequacy are much 
better for the Weighted N-gram approach than 
for BLEU. 
Also from the linguistic point of view, S-score 
weights and N-grams may only be reasonably 
good approximations of Adequacy, which in-
volves a wide range of factors, like syntactic and 
semantic issues that cannot be captured by N-
gram matches and require a thesaurus and other 
knowledge-based extensions. Accurate formal 
models of translation variation may also be use-
ful for improving automatic evaluation of Ade-
quacy. 
The proposed evaluation method also pre-
serves the ability of BLEU to consistently predict 
scores for Fluency: Precision weighted by tf.idf 
scores has the strongest positive correlation with 
this aspect of MT quality, which is slightly better 
than the values for BLEU; (S-score: r(2)= 
0.9912, p<0.01; r(2)= 0.9769, p<0.05; tf.idf 
score: r(2)= 0.9987, p<0.001; r(2)= 0.9998, 
p<0.001). 
The results suggest that weighted Precision 
gives a good approximation of Fluency. Similar 
results with non-weighted approach are only 
achieved if some aspect of Recall is integrated 
into the evaluation metric (either as modified pre-
cision, as in BLEU, or as an aspect of the F-
score). Weighted Recall (especially with S-
scores) gives a reasonably good approximation of 
Adequacy. 
On the one hand using 1 human reference with 
uniform results is essential for our methodology, 
since it means that there is no more ?trouble with 
Recall? (Papineni et al, 2002:314) ? a system?s 
ability to avoid under-generation of N-grams can 
now be reliably measured. On the other hand, 
using a single human reference translation in-
stead of multiple translations will certainly in-
crease the usability of N-gram based MT 
evaluation tools. 
The fact that non-weighted F-scores also have 
high correlation with Fluency suggests a new 
linguistic interpretation of the nature of these two 
quality criteria: it is intuitively plausible that Flu-
ency subsumes, i.e. presupposes Adequacy (simi-
larly to the way the F-score subsumes Recall, 
which among all other scores gives the best cor-
relation with Adequacy). The non-weighted F-
score correlates more strongly with Fluency than 
either of its components: Precision and Recall; 
similarly Adequacy might make a contribution to 
Fluency together with some other factors. It is 
conceivable that people need adequate transla-
tions (or at least translations that make sense) in 
order to be able to make judgments about natu-
ralness, or Fluency.  
Being able to make some sense out of a text 
could be the major ground for judging Adequacy: 
sensible mistranslations in MT are relatively rare 
events. This may be the consequence of a princi-
ple similar to the ?second law of thermodynam-
ics? applied to text structure, ? in practice it is 
much rarer to some alternative sense to be cre-
ated (even if the number of possible error types 
could be significant), than to destroy the existing 
sense in translation, so the majority of inadequate 
translations are just nonsense. However, in con-
trast to human translation, fluent mistranslations 
in MT are even rarer than disfluent ones, accord-
ing to the same principle. A real difference in 
scores is made by segments which make sense 
and may or may not be fluent, and things which 
do not make any sense and about which it is hard 
to tell whether they are fluent. 
This suggestion may be empirically tested: if 
Adequacy is a necessary precondition for Flu-
ency, there should be a greater inter-annotator 
disagreement in Fluency scores on texts or seg-
ments which have lower Adequacy scores. This 
will be a topic of future research. 
We note that for the DARPA corpus the corre-
lation scores presented are highest if the evalua-
tion unit is an entire corpus of translations 
produced by an MT system, and for text-level 
evaluation, correlation is much lower. A similar 
observation was made in (Papineni et al, 2002: 
313). This may be due to the fact that human 
judges are less consistent, especially for puzzling 
segments that do not fit the scoring guidelines, 
like nonsense segments for which it is hard to 
decide whether they are fluent or even adequate. 
However, this randomness is leveled out if the 
evaluation unit increases in size ? from the text 
level to the corpus level.  
Automatic evaluation methods such as BLEU 
(Papineni et al, 2002), RED (Akiba et al, 2001), 
or the weighted N-gram model proposed here 
may be more consistent in judging quality as 
compared to human evaluators, but human judg-
ments remain the only criteria for meta-
evaluating the automatic methods. 
4. Stability of weighted evaluation scores 
In this section we investigate how reliable is the 
use of a single human reference translation. The 
stability of the scores is central to the issue of 
computing Recall and reducing the cost of auto-
matic evaluation. We also would like to compare 
the stability of our results with the stability of the 
baseline non-weighted N-gram model using a 
single reference. 
In this stage of the experiment we measured 
the changes that occur for the scores of MT sys-
tems if an alternative reference translation is used 
? both for the baseline N-gram counts and for the 
weighted N-gram model. Standard deviation was 
computed for each pair of evaluation scores pro-
duced by the two runs of the system with alterna-
tive human references. An average of these 
standard deviations is the measure of stability for 
a given score. The results of these calculations 
are presented in Table 5.

Table 5. Stability of scores 
 
Standard deviation for weighted scores is gener-
ally slightly higher, but both the baseline and the 
weighted N-gram approaches give relatively sta-
ble results: the average standard deviation was 
not greater than 0.0027, which means that both 
will produce reliable figures with just a single 
human reference translation (although interpreta-
tion of the score with a single reference should be 
different than with multiple references). 
Somewhat higher standard deviation figures 
for the weighted N-gram model confirm the sug-
gestion that a word?s importance for translation 
cannot be straightforwardly derived from the 
model of the legitimate translation variation im-
plemented in BLEU and needs the salience 
weights, such as tf.idf or S-scores. 
5. Conclusion and future work  
The results for weighted N-gram models have a 
significantly higher correlation with human intui-
tive judgements about translation Adequacy and 
Fluency than the baseline N-gram evaluation 
measures which are used in the BLEU MT 
evaluation toolkit. This shows that they are a 
promising direction of research. Future work will 
apply our approach to evaluating MT into lan-
guages other than English, extending the experi-
ment to a larger number of MT systems built on 
different architectures and to larger corpora. 
However, the results of the experiment may 
also have implications for MT development: sig-
nificance weights may be used to rank the rela-
tive ?importance? of translation equivalents. At 
present all MT architectures (knowledge-based, 
example-based, and statistical) treat all transla-
tion equivalents equally, so MT systems cannot 
dynamically prioritise rule applications, and 
translations of the central concepts in texts are 
often lost among excessively literal translations 
of less important concepts and function words. 
For example, for statistical MT significance 
weights of lexical items may indicate which 
words have to be introduced into the target text 
using the translation model for source and target 
languages, and which need to be brought there by 
the language model for the target corpora. Simi-
lar ideas may be useful for the Example-based 
and Rule-based MT architectures. The general 
idea is that different pieces of information ex-
pressed in the source text are not equally impor-
tant for translation: MT systems that have no 
means for prioritising this information often in-
troduce excessive information noise into the tar-
get text by literally translating structural 
information, etymology of proper names, collo-
cations that are unacceptable in the target lan-
guage, etc. This information noise often obscures 
important translation equivalents and prevents 
the users from focusing on the relevant bits. MT 
quality may benefit from filtering out this exces-
sive information as much as from frequently rec-
ommended extension of knowledge sources for 
MT systems. The significance weights may 
schedule the priority for retrieving translation 
equivalents and motivate application of compen-
sation strategies in translation, e.g., adding or 
deleting implicitly inferable information in the 
target text, using non-literal strategies, such as 
transposition or modulation (Vinay and Darbel-
net, 1995). Such weights may allow MT systems 
to make an approximate distinction between sali-
ent words which require proper translation 
equivalents and structural material both in the 
source and in the target texts. Exploring applica-
bility of this idea to various MT architectures is 
another direction for future research.
