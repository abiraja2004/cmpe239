(~ene:x'ic terms cam be divided into two 
refercnbi :Qly dif ferent groups. Generic term 
oi" l,h~ :~':i~'st group is a name (or a definite 
dcsc.ci.ption) of the corresponding class of

One of the mosl, important aspects of 
langu~ge comp~-ehension is comprehension of 
~.- e f e _~ e n c e -,- :L~e~ of a corresponden- 
ce })etweez~ ~{ ~Je~itence (and some of its consbi-  
friends) and reality, which is brought about 
by the speaker in the speech act. As is 
usual for a logical approach to language, 
all types of reference, with the except ion 
of concrete reference, are reduced to quan- 
t i f icat ion of di f ferent kinds, and quanti f i -  
cat ion can  be defined~ with a suff ic ient de-

for .~Jentm:l.ces with generic terms is easi ly 
refuted by contradict ing examples. Thus, an 
attempt to reduce referent ia l  meaning of 
the g(me:cic indef in i te art ic le in Engl ish 
to 'th~vl~ o f  the  quanti f ier  adject ive 
(m~de in Jespersen 1927)  can be demonstra-  
ted to be futile; in fact, statement (la), 
for exaunple, is usual ly considered to be 
true, while (lb) is def in i te ly false (thougjl 
and a l l  are synonyms): 
(1) a. N o r v e ~ c y vysokogo rosta 
w e g i a n s are tall' 
n o r v e ~ c y vysokogo 
'E o r 
b. V s e

'A 1 1 
tall' 
n o r w e ~ i a n s are 
An attempt to capture referent ial  as- 
pects of the meaning of a generic term with 
the help of a "quanti f ier  of major ity" (Par- 
sons 1970) or a quant i f ier  'usually' raay be, 
perhaps, successful  for sentence (la), which 
is approximately synonymous to sentence (2): 
(2) N o r v e ~ c y oby~no ~ysokogo rosta 
'N o r w e g i a n s are usual ly tall~ 
but the idea of major i ty  has nothing to do 
with the meaning of such sentences as 
(3) Kit - m lekop i ta ju~ee 
'The whale is a m~al '  
(indeed, (3) ~ (3')*A whale is.usual ly a 
mammal);  or with the meaning of sentence 
(4) A t o m sostoit iz jadra i e lektronov 
'A t o m consists of the nucleus and 
electrons'.  
A suggest ion was made to the effect that 
generic terms do not refer to entit ies of 
the real world at all. Thus, according to 
Wierzb icka 1980, in such sentences as (1) 
tal lness is attr ibuted not to a norwegian 
(i.e. not to a real person), but to our 
i m a g e of a norwegian. However, this 
claim, even if it is true, cannot be true 
for all species of generic expressions. Por 
one thing, generic terms can occur in the 
context of identity sentences, cf. 
(5) Deti - ~to budu~ie  l judl 
'Chi ldren are men to be'. 
And what is ident i ty ' i f  not identity of re- 
ference? 501 
From a formal point of view, what cha- 
racter izes generic noun phrases~ at least in 
languages without articles, such as Russian, 
is the fact that they do not comprise any 
determiners or quant i f ier  adjectives, not 
only in the expl ic ite but in the implicite 
form as well. In other words, generic ~Ps 
evade referent ia l  character izat ion:  no words 
expl ic i tel~ express ing the m o d e o f 
r e f e r e n c e of a noun phrase (cf. Pa~ 
du~eva \ ] .985) can occur  w i th in  a ge~leric NP; 
moreover, no words can be added to a generic 
NP to ~ake clear its referent ia l  meaning or 
meanings, as is obvious from examples (1) - 
(5). The analysis which fol lows aims at pro- 
v iding generic l~Ps with such an interpreta-  
t ion of their referent ia l  import that would 
match this formal character izat ion.  Our di- 
rect aim is to provide an analysis for gene- 
ric NPs of hussian, but many of the problems 
discussed are semantic in nature and thus 
language independent.  
2. Generic phrases denot ing s i tuat ions 
Generic use  is co~m~zon not only for noun 
phrases denot ing objects, like those in  (J)-~ 
(5), but also for noun phrases with proposi -  
t ional meaning, cfo 
(6) C v e t e n i j e r~i vsegda napomi-  
naet ~mue na~alo vojny 
'F \] o w e r i n g o f r y e always 
reminds me of the begin ing of the war'. 
(7) U b i j s t v o otvrat i te l 'no 
'A s s a s s i n a t i o n is abomin- 
able ' . 
}.ioreover, generic uses are possible also 
for predicat ive denominat ions of situations: 
(8) It often happens that a y o u n g 
man o v e r e s t i m a t e s  
h i s  resources .  
(9) Operat ion is always dangerous when 
t h e p a t i e n t i s m o r e 
than  70. 
(lO) K e d i n e s always in a hurry? 
(ll) She usual ly  got fr ightened when h e 
b r o u g h t  her  f lowers .  
(12) R y b a ~ n i e t s golovy 
'A f i s h r o t s beginning with 
its head'. 
(13) J o h n b e a t s h i s w i f e 
in the yard. 
Study of generic reference is usual ly  
conf ined to one part icu lar  class of generic 
5O2 
terms ~ to those denot ing objects? What we 
claim is that at least in this case broaden~ 
ing the object of invest igat ion wil l  not 
compl icate the whole picture; just the oppo -~ 
site, it may contr ibute to its clar i f icat ion? 
3. Gener:\[cs as a grs~nmatical problem 
Generic use is a problem not only fo:c 
referent ia l  semantics but also for a de~, 
scr ipt ive gra~rm~ar of a language? To ment ion 
just two points? 
a) In the context of a generic NP grar~,.- 
matical  Number (i.e. the opposit ion of Sin.,, 
gular vs. Plural) cannot retain its usual 
meaning. Ilowever, on the one hand, the 
choice of ~umber in generic NPs is not ri- 
gidly regulated~ i.e. synonymous var iat ion 
of Number is possible, cfo 
(14) a, L o 5 a d' - umnoje ~yvotnoje 
'A h o r s e is a clever animal'? 
b. L o ~ a d i ~-, m~uyje ~yvo~nyje 
'11 o r s e s are clever animals'? 
On the other hand, S ingular  and Plural  in 
generic, N~s -a~ce not-  Tz~el~ "i:n-be-rcl~angeable 
thus, it is impossible to say 
(15) U has v dome zavels 'a t a r a k a n 
(Sg) 
in the meaning 'There are cockroaches in 
our house', if only in the context of a 
"lan&axage game", and it is absolutely impos-. 
sible to use sentence 
(16) ~Glaz u ~toj ryby imeet formu 
g r u ~ (Pl) 
in order to convey the meaning 'The eye of 
this f ish has the shape of a p~ a r'o There 
is a strong feel ing that the choice of grsm~- 
mat ica l  Number  in generic NPs is dependent 
upon their  referent ia l  propert ies;  in other 
words, it seems that di f ferent classes of 
generic NPs can be del imitated with di f fer~ 
ent requirements as for the choice of Nma~ 
bet. 
b) Another  grammatical  problem connected 
with generic expressions, concerns the choirs 
ce of Tense and Aspect of the verb in a ge~ 
neric proposit ion. In Lyons 1978 it is sug- 
gested that generic proposi t ions lie out  of 
the scope of the Tense opposit ion (ice, that 
they are omnitemporal) .  Lyons claims that 
this thesis is not d isproved by such examp~ 
les as 
(17) D i n o s a u r s were peaceful  
animals , 
because Past Tense in such sentences corres- 
ponds only-to the fact that dinosaurs are 
extinct and not to the fact that they have 
stopped being peaceful,  as would be the case 
if Past Tense had been used here in its usu- 
al meaningo Sti l l  for such sentence as 
(18) D i n o s a u r s died out (became 
ext  i nc  t ) 
i t  wou ld  be absurd  to  ma inta in  that  i t  i s  
omaitemporal :  in ( \ ] .8)  Past  Tense has its 
most com~,~on meaning? 
4.. Generic term and generic proposi t ion 
The main conclusion that can be drawn 
from the exist ing l i terature on generics 
(cfo a substant ial  rev iew in Car lson 1978)is 
that generic expessions are heterogeneous 
(W~ that in Russ ian even less information 
can be got from the gra~mgatical form of a 
generic term than in English, because of the 
lack of ~rt.lcles)o Thus the line of analysis 
Which we fo l low in this study consists in 
making a series of del imitat ions that would 
divlde generic expressions i n to  sew.~ral dif~ 
ferent groups so that each statement would 
apply only to that group of generic expres- 
sions : for  wh ich  i t  :Ls t rne .  
~'irs\[ o?' all, it J.s necessary to sepaz,a- 
te generic NPs when used in 'the context of a 
g e n e r i c  p r o p o s i t i o n  (or 
generic statement) from their  occurrences in 
al l  otheL" contexts. We propose the fo l lowing 
definit ion: A propos i t ion is cal led generic 
if a generic noun phrase G const i tutes its 
n o t \[ o n a 1 t h e m e (topic), i.e. 
if this propos i t ion is a b o u t Go Thus, 
in (19)propos i t ion  is generic: 
(19) P r o f e s s i o n a 1 m a t h e - 
m a t i c i a n wil l  read the book 
by M.At ja with pleasure. 
o\[ndeed, (19) is a statement a b o u t pro- 
fessional  mathematic ians? Neanwhile,  (20) is 
not a generic statement- ~ 
(20) The book by NoAt ja  wil l  be of inte~ 
res-\[t for p r o f e s s i o n a 1 
m a t h e m a t i c i a n s  . 
In fact, (20) is not about mathematic ians# 
its them8 is a concrete indiv idual ized ob~ 
ject ~ a book by ~oAtjao 
Generic NPs const i tut ing the subject of 
a generic propos i t ion are more readi\].y sub- 
~itted to semantic analysis, for in this con~- 
text referent ia l  import of gener ic i ty can be 
represented, at least in some oontexts~ a~ a 
kind. of quanti f icat ion. Indeed, if a generic 
NP is a subject of a proposit ion, then the 
quant i f ier  which bounds this NP has maximum 
scope~ its scope is the whole sentence. And 
if so then the referencial  import of this 
quantif ier, and hence of the generic NP, can 
be revealed by means of truth condit ions of 
the sentence a s a w h o i e o Other- 
wise, ice. in cases where the generic ~iP 
does not constitute ~he subject of the pro~ 
posit ion, it is a l together unclear, what 
proposi t ion const i tutes the scope of ~he 
supposed "generic quantif ier"~ Thus, for 
sentences in (21) logical representat ion is 
a puzzle 
(21) a. Ivan can kill a b e a r o 
b. John doesn't  l ike p o I i c e ~-~ 
men?  
c? Ego zasadi l i  v kameru ~3 m e r t -~ 
n iko  v 
'He was put into the cell for 
m e n s e n t e n c e d L o 
death '  
But even for generic proposit ions th~.'re 
is no unique formu\].ation of truth conditi-.~ 
ons val id for all the contexts? To formu~ 
late truth condit ions for gener: i .c  proposJ_.--~ 
t ions exhaustivel~ i~ :is necessary to re~. 
veal all relevant opposit ions of contexts, 
l inguist ic  and extral ingaist ic~ iz~ which 
the generic subject of a generic proposi~ 
tion might occur (note that the subject of 
the proposi t ion need not coincide wJ.th its 
grmamatical  subject, especial ly in ~lussian)o 
5. Generic NPs as names of classes 
In some contexts generic terms can be 
successful ly  treated as names (or descrip~ 
tions) of the corresponding clans. ~k~r exam- 
ple, generic terms used as subjects of pre-~ 
dicates which are meaningless unless when 
predicated to classes (.as to be a ir~mr!jal; 
to become extinct in examples (3) and (18)), 
are best represented as names of classes (in 
Engl ish such' generic terms can only be mark~- 
ed by a def inite article~ in Russian they 
have no special d ist inct ive features), Cfo 
(22)  Nekogda j a g u a r byl z'aspros~ra~

p~:~oposition is understood with the type of

~ruth, cf,~ such plat i tudes as Extremes meet 
-o to sound like t~th  it must be understood 
Lts 'Extremes usual ly meet' or even 'It may 
be the cs,~e that extremes meet'. 
Thus~ for "typical" generic proposit ions,  
such as (1), two propert ies are substantial:  
l) they a:ee quanti f ied implicitely; 2) their 
quant i f icat ion belongs to the semantic type 
gusually ~ !.ruth condit ions for a typical  
generic proposi t ion can be formulated as 
fo l lows  
(26) A ~eneric proposi t ion with the sub- 
ject s and the predicate P is t1~e if 
and only if for any xC-~ E s (where E s 
is the extension of the general 'term 
s) it is u s u a 1 1 y the case 
that P(s) is true? 
The meaning of usually\[ can be descr ibed 
i n  the  sa~e way  as  the  mean ing  o f  o ther  
words  i s  descr ibed  in  lex ica l  semant ics .  
Thus, s j!_s usua l l~  ~ '~or most x E E s it 
is true that l~(x), and this s i tuat ion is con- 
s idered to be natural '? This def in i t ion 
gives an explanat ion to the fo l lowing examp- 
le f~'om Carlson 1978: sentence Books are 
usua l l~)a j !erbacks  sounds odd, though it is, 
perhaps, true that most books are now paper- 
basks? The fact is, that this s i tuat ion is 
not as yet considered to be natural.  
7o Adverbia l  quant i f ica l ion 
In a similar way truth condit ions for 
other types of adverbial  quant i f icat ion in 
generic p~oposi t ions can be stated. What is 
important is the fact that there are con- 
texts in ~hich adverbial  quant i f icat ion can- 
not be reduced to quant i f icat ion over the 
extension of the subject term. 
Take ex~np\]e 
(27) Young people usual ly  overest imate 
their resourseso 
~\[ts meaning cannot be adequately repre- 
sented by means of quant i f icat ion over the 
set of all young people: (27) ~ 'Most young 
people overest imale their  resourses'.  What 
is ment in (27) is that f o r m o s t 
c a s e s when a young man est imates his 
(or her) resourses he overest imates them . 
So it is c lear that quant i f icat ion over si- 
tuat ions and not over objects is involved 
here. In the same way we can represent  the 
meaning of sentences (8) - (13) with generic 
names of s i tuat ions from section 2. 
8. Grammatical  problems revis i ted 
Referent ia l  opposit ions that were intro- 
duced al low us to give explanat ions to at 
least some of grmnmatical  phenomena con- 
nected with generics, ~l ich were ment ioned 
in section 3. 
Thus,, (28a) and (28b) are not str ict ly 
synonymous: 
(28) a. A m e r i k a n e c (Sg) delovit 
'An american is effective'.  
b,. A m e r i k a n c y (P1) delovity 
' J~ericans are efficient' 
The di f ference in meaning may be ascr ibed to 
the fact that (285) is a usual type of gene- 
ric proposit ions ~ i le  (28a) descr ibes our 
mental  image of an American (in the sense of 
Wierzbicka 1980). 
Except ional  behavior of generic terms 
with respect to Tense, exempl i f ied by (18), 
canbe  expla ined by the fact that sentence 
(18) does not express a generic proposit ion: 
NP dinosaurs is here used as a name of 
class. Genuine generic proposit ions are, in 
fact, o~mitemporal .  
9. Conclus ion 
Our invest igat ion can be looked upon as 
a proof of the thesis that for typical gene- 
ric noun phrases a logico-semant ic  interpre- 
tat ion can be given which str ict ly corres- 
ponds to their surface structure (in art ic-  
le- lack ing languages): generic terms can be 
treated as referent ia l ly  incomplete phrases, 
with qu~nti f icat ion expressed outside the 
phrase itself or not expressed at all.
