Abstract 
Human annotation for Co-reference Resolu-
tion (CRR) is labor intensive and costly, and 
only a handful of annotated corpora are cur-
rently available. However, corpora with 
Named Entity (NE) annotations are widely 
available. Also, unlike current CRR systems, 
state-of-the-art NER systems have very high 
accuracy and can generate NE labels that are 
very close to the gold standard for unlabeled 
corpora.  We propose a new set of metrics col-
lectively called CONE for Named Entity Co-
reference Resolution (NE-CRR) that use a 
subset of gold standard annotations, with the 
advantage that this subset can be easily ap-
proximated using NE labels when gold stan-
dard CRR annotations are absent. We define 
CONE B3 and CONE CEAF metrics based on 
the traditional B3 and CEAF metrics and show 
that CONE B3 and CONE CEAF scores of any 
CRR system on any dataset are highly corre-
lated with its B3 and CEAF scores respectively. 
We obtain correlation factors greater than 0.6 
for all CRR systems across all datasets, and a 
best-case correlation factor of 0.8. We also 
present a baseline method to estimate the gold 
standard required by CONE metrics, and show 
that CONE B3 and CONE CEAF scores using 
this estimated gold standard are also correlated 
with B3 and CEAF scores respectively. We 
thus demonstrate the suitability of CONE 
B3and CONE CEAF for automatic evaluation 
of NE-CRR. 
1 Introduction 
Co-reference resolution (CRR) is the problem of 
determining whether two entity mentions in a 
text refer to the same entity in real world or not. 
Noun Phrase CRR (NP-CRR) considers all noun 
phrases as entities, while Named Entity CRR 
restricts itself to noun phrases that describe a 
Named Entity. In this paper, we consider the task 
of Named Entity CRR (NE-CRR) only. Most, if 
not all, recent efforts in the field of CRR have 
concentrated on machine-learning based ap-
proaches. Many of them formulate the problem 
as a pair-wise binary classification task, in which 
possible co-reference between every pair of men-
tions is considered, and produce chains of co-
referring mentions for each entity as their output. 
One of the most important problems in CRR is 
the evaluation of CRR results. Different evalua-
tion metrics have been proposed for this task. B-
cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF 
(Luo, 2005) are the two most popular metrics; 
they compute Precision, Recall and F1 measure 
between matched equivalent classes and use 
weighted sums of Precision, Recall and F1 to 
produce a global score. Like all metrics, B3 and 
CEAF require gold standard annotations; howev-
er, gold standard CRR annotations are scarce, 
because producing such annotations involves a 
substantial amount of human effort since it re-
quires an in-depth knowledge of linguistics and a 
high level of understanding of the particular text. 
Consequently, very few corpora with gold stan-
dard CRR annotations are available (NIST, 2003; 
MUC-6, 1995; Agirre, 2007). By contrast, gold 
standard Named Entity (NE) annotations are easy 
to produce; indeed, there are many NE annotated 
corpora of different sizes and genres. Similarly, 
there are few CRR systems and even the best 
scores obtained by them are only in the region of 
F1 = 0.5 - 0.6. There are only four such CRR 
systems freely available, to the best of our know-
ledge (Bengston and Roth, 2007; Versley et al, 
2008; Baldridge and Torton, 2004; Baldwin and 
Carpenter, 2003). In comparison, there are nu-
merous Named Entity recognition (NER) sys-
tems, both general-purpose and specialized, and 
many of them achieve scores better than F1 = 
0.95 (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Finkel et al, 
136
2005). Although these facts can be partly attri-
buted to the ?hardness? of CRR compared to 
NER, they also reflect the substantial gap be-
tween NER and CRR research. In this paper, we 
present a set of metrics, collectively called 
CONE, that leverage widely available NER sys-
tems and resources and tools for the task of eva-
luating co-reference resolution systems. The ba-
sic idea behind CONE is to predict a CRR sys-
tem?s performance for the task of full NE-CRR 
on some dataset using its performance for the 
subtask of named mentions extraction and group-
ing (NMEG) on that dataset. The advantage of 
doing so is that measuring NE-CRR performance 
requires the co-reference information of all men-
tions of a Named Entity, including named men-
tions, nominal and pronominal references, while 
measuring the NMEG performance only requires 
co-reference information of named mentions of a 
NE, and this information is relatively easy to ob-
tain automatically even in the absence of gold 
standard annotations. We compute correlation 
between CONE B3, B3, CONE CEAF and CEAF 
scores for various CRR systems on various gold-
standard annotated datasets and show that the 
CONE B3 and B3 scores are highly correlated for 
all such combinations of CRR systems and data-
sets, as are CONE CEAF and CEAF scores, with 
a best-case correlation of 0.8. We produce esti-
mated gold standard annotations for the Enron 
email corpus, since no actual gold standard CRR 
annotations exist for it, and then use CONE B3 
and CONE CEAF with these estimated gold 
standard annotations to compare the performance 
of various NE-CRR systems on this corpus. No 
such comparison has been previously performed 
for the Enron corpus. 
We adopt the same terminology as in (Luo, 
2005): a mention refers to each individual phrase 
and an entity refers to the equivalence class or 
co-reference chain with several mentions. This 
allows us to note some differences between NE-
CRR and NP-CRR. NE-CRR involves indentify-
ing named entities and extracting their co-
referring mentions; equivalences classes without 
any NEs are not considered. NE-CRR is thus 
clearly a subset of NP-CRR, where all co-
referring mentions and equivalence classes are 
considered. However, we focus on NE-CRR be-
cause it is currently a more active research area 
than NP-CRR and a better fit for target applica-
tions such as text forensics and web mining, and 
also because it is more amenable to the automatic 
evaluation approach that we propose. 
The research questions that motivate our work 
are:  
(1) Is it possible to use only NER resources to 
evaluate NE-CRR systems? If so, how is this 
problem formulated?  
(2) How does one perform evaluation in a way 
that is accurate and automatic with least hu-
man intervention?  
(3) How does one perform evaluation on large 
unlabeled datasets?  
We show that our CONE metrics achieve good 
results and represent a promising first step to-
ward answering these questions.  
 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We 
present related work in the field of automatic 
evaluation methods for natural language 
processing tasks in Section 2. In Section 3, we 
give an overview of the standard metrics current-
ly used for evaluating co-reference resolution. 
We define our new metrics CONE B3 and CONE 
CEAF in Section 4. In section 5, we provide ex-
perimental results that illustrate the performance 
of CONE B3 and CONE CEAF compared to B3 
and CEAF respectively. In Section 6, we give an 
example of the application of CONE metrics by 
evaluating NE-CRR systems on an unlabeled 
dataset, and discuss possible drawbacks and ex-
tensions of these metrics. Finally, in section 7 we 
present our conclusions and ideas for future 
work.  
2 Related Work 
There has been a substantial amount of research 
devoted to automatic evaluation for natural lan-
guage processing, especially tasks involving lan-
guage generation. The BLEU score (Papineni et 
al., 2002) proposed for evaluating machine trans-
lation results is the best known example of this. 
It uses n-gram statistics between machine gener-
ated results and references. It inspired the 
ROUGE metric (Lin and Hovy, 2003) and other 
methods (Louis and Nenkova, 2009) to perform 
automatic evaluation of text summarization. Both 
these metrics have show strong correlation be-
tween automatic evaluation results and human 
judgments. The two metrics successfully reduce 
the need for human judgment and help speed up 
research by allowing large-scale evaluation. 
Another example is the alignment entropy (Per-
vouchine et al, 2009) for evaluating translitera-
tion alignment. It reduces the need for alignment 
gold standard and highly correlates with transli-
teration system performance. Thus it is able to 
137
serve as a good metric for transliteration align-
ment. We contrast our work with (Stoyanov et al, 
2009), who show that the co-reference resolution 
problem can be separated into different parts ac-
cording to the type of the mention. Some parts 
are relatively easy to solve. The resolver per-
forms equally well in each part across datasets. 
They use the statistics of mentions in different 
parts with test results on other datasets as a pre-
dictor for unseen datasets, and obtain promising 
results with good correlations. We approach the 
problem from a different perspective. In our 
work, we show the correlation between the 
scores on traditional metrics and scores on our 
CONE metrics, and show how to automatically 
estimate the gold standard required by CONE 
metrics. Thus our method is able to predict the 
co-reference resolution performance without 
gold standard at all. We base our new metrics on 
the standard B3 and CEAF metrics used for com-
puting CRR scores. (Vilian et al, 1995; Bagga 
and Baldwin, 1998; Luo, 2005). B3 and CEAF 
are believed to be more discriminative and inter-
pretable than earlier metrics and are widely 
adopted especially for machine-learning based 
approaches.  
 
3 Standard Metrics: B3 and CEAF 
We now provide an overview of the standard B3 
and CEAF metrics used to evaluate CRR sys-
tems. Both metrics assume that a CRR system 
produces a set of equivalence classes {O} and 
assigns each mention to only one class. Let Oi be 
the class to which the ith mention was assigned 
by the system. We also assume that we have a set 
of correct equivalence classes {G} (the gold 
standard). Let Gi be the gold standard class to 
which the ith mention should belong. Let Ni de-
note the number of mentions in Oi which are also 
in Gi ? the correct mentions. B
3 computes the 
presence rate of correct mentions in the same 
equivalent classes. The individual precision and 
recall score is defined as follows: 
|| i
i
i O
NP ?
 
|| i
i
i G
NR ?
 
Here |Oi| and |Gi| are the cardinalities of sets Oi 
and Gi.   
The final precision and recall scores are: 
?
?
?
n
i
ii PwP
1
 ?
?
?
n
i
ii RwR
1
 
Here, in the simplest case the weight wi is set to 
1/n, equal for all mentions. 
CEAF (Luo, 2005) produces the optimal 
matching between output classes and true classes 
first, with the constraint that one true class, Gi, 
can be mapped to at most one output class, say 
Of(i) and vice versa. This can be solved by the 
KM algorithm (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres, 1957) for 
maximum matching in a bipartite graph. CEAF 
then computes the precision and recall score as 
follows: 
?
?
?
i
i
i
ifi
O
M
P
)(,      
?
?
?
i

ifi

M

We use the terms Mi,j from CEAF to re-write B
3, 
its formulas then reduce to: 
???? i j i
ji
i
i O
M
O
P
2

???? i j i

We can see that B3 simply iterates through all 
pairs of matchings instead of considering the one 
to one mappings as CEAF does. Thus, B3 com-
putes the weighted sum of the F-measures for 
each individual mention which helps alleviate the 
bias in the pure link-based F-measure, while 
CEAF computes the same as B3 but enforces at 
most one matched equivalence class for every 
class in the system output and gold standard out-
put. 
4 CONE B3 and CONE CEAF Metrics:  
We now formally define the new CONE B3 and 
CONE CEAF metrics that we propose for 
automatic evaluation of NE-CRR systems. 
      Let G denote the set of gold standard 
annotations and O denote the output of an NE-
CRR system. Let Gi denote the equivalent class 
of entity i in the gold standard and Oj denote the 
equivalence class for entity j in the system output.  
Also let Gij denote the j
th mention in the 
equivalence class of entity i in the gold standard 
and Oij denote the j
th mention in the system 
output. 
As described earlier, the standard B3 and CEAF 
metrics evaluate scores using G and O and can 
be thought of as functions of the form B3(G, O). 
and CEAF(G, O) respectively. Let us use 
Score(G, O) to collectively refer to both these 
138
functions. An equivalence class Gi in G may 
contain three types of mentions: named mentions 
gNMij, nominal mentions g
NO
ij, and pronominal 
mentions gPRij. Similarly, we can define o
NM
ij, 
oNOij and o
PR
ij for a class Oi in O. Now for each 
gold standard equivalence class Gi and system 
output equivalence class Oi, we define the 
following sets GNMi  and  O
NM
i: 
iijNMijNMiNM GggGi ??? },{,  
iijNMijNMiNM OooOi ??? },{,  
In other words, GNMi and O
NM
i are the subsets of 
Gi and Oi containing all named mentions and no 
mentions of any other type.  
Let GNM denote the set of all such equivalance 
classes GNMi and O
NM denote the set of all 
equivalence classes ONMi. It is clear that G
NM and 
ONM are pruned versions of the gold standard 
annotations and system output respectively. 
We now define CONE B3 and CONE CEAF as 
follows: 
CONE B3 = B3(GNM, ONM) 
CONE CEAF = CEAF(GNM, ONM) 
 
Following our previous notation, we denote 
CONE B3 and CONE CEAF collectively as 
Score(GNM, ONM). We observe that Score(GNM, 
ONM) measures a NE-CRR system?s  
performance for the NE-CRR subtask of named 
mentions extraction and grouping (NMEG). We 
find that Score(GNM, ONM) is highly correlated 
with Score(G, O) for all the freely available NE-
CRR systems over various datasets. This 
provides the neccessary  justification for the use 
of Score(GNM, ONM).  
We use SYNERGY (Shah et al, 2010), an 
ensemble NER system that combines the UIUC 
NER (Ritanov and Roth, 2009) and Stanford 
NER (Finkel et al, 2005) systems, to produce 
GNM and ONM from G and O by  selecting named 
mentions. However, any other good NER system 
would serve the same purpose. 
We see that while standard evaluation metrics 
require the use of G, i.e. the full set of NE-CRR 
gold standard annotations including named, 
nominal and pronimal mentions, CONE metrics 
require only GNM, i.e. gold standard annotations 
consisting of named mentions only. The key 
advantage of using CONE metrics is that GNM 
can be automatically approximated using an 
NER system with a good degree of accuracy. 
This is because state-of-the-art NER systems 
achieve near-optimal performance, exceeding F1 
= 0.95 in many cases, and after obtaining their 
output, the task of estimating GNM reduces to 
simply clustering it to seperate mentions of 
diffrerent real-world entities. This clustering can 
be thought of as a form of named entity matching, 
which is not a very hard problem. There exist 
systems that perform such matching in a 
sophisticated manner with a high degree of 
accuracy. We use simple heuristics such as exact 
matching, word matches, matches between in-
itials, etc. to design such a matching system 
ourselves and use it to obtain estimates of GNM, 
say GNM-approx. We then calculate CONE B3 and 
CONE CEAF scores using GNM-approx instead of 
GNM; in other words, we perform fully automatic 
evaluation of NE-CRR systems by using 
Score(GNM-approx, ONM) instead of Score(GNM, 
ONM). In order to show the validity of this 
evaluation, we calculate the correlation between 
the Score(GNM-approx, ONM) and Score(G, O) for  
different NE-CRR systems across different 
datasets and find that they are indeed correlated. 
CONE thus makes automatic evaluation of NE-
CRR systems possible. By leveraging the widely 
available named entity resources, it reduces the 
need for gold standard annotations in the 
evaluation process. 
4.1 Analysis 
There are two major kinds of errors that affect 
the performance of NE-CRR systems for the full 
NE-CRR task: 
? Missing Named Entity (MNE): If a named 
mention is missing from the system output, 
it is very likely that its nearby nominal and 
anaphoric mentions will be lost, too 
? Incorrectly grouped Named Entity (IGNE): 
Even if the named mention is correctly iden-
tified with its nearby nominal and anaphoric 
mentions to form a chain, it is still possible 
to misclassify the named mentions and its 
co-reference chain 
Consider the following example of these two 
types of errors. Here, the alphabets represent the 
named mentions and numbers represent other 
type of mentions: 
 
Gold standard, G: (A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, 4) 
Output from System 1, O1: (A, B, 1, 2, 3) 
Output from System 2, O2: (A, C, 1, 2, 4), (B, 3) 
O1 shows an example of an MNE error, while 
O2 shows an example of an IGNE error.  
 
Both these types of errors are in fact rooted in 
named mention extraction and grouping 
(NMEG). Therefore, we hypothesize that they 
must be preserved in a NE-CRR system?s output 
139
for the subtask of named mentions extraction and 
grouping (NMEG) and will be reflected in the 
CONE B3 and CONE CEAF metrics that eva-
luate scores for this subtask. Consider the follow-
ing extension of the previous example:  
 
GNM: (A, B, C) 
O1NM: (A, B) 
O2NM: (A, C), (B) 
 
We observe that the MNE error in O1 is pre-
served in O1NM, and the IGNE error in O2 is pre-
served in O2NM. Empirically we sample several 
output files in our experiments and observe the 
same phenomena. Therefore, we argue that it is 
possible to capture the two major kinds of errors 
described by considering only GNM and ONM in-
stead of G and O.  
 
We now provide a more detailed theoretical 
analysis of the CONE metrics. For a given NE-
CRR system and dataset, consider the system 
output O and gold standard annotation G. Let P 
and R indicate precision and recall scores ob-
tained by evaluating O against G, using CEAF. If 
we replace both G and O with their subsets GNM 
and ONM respectively, such that GNM and ONM 
contain only named mentions, we can modify the 
equations for precision and recall for CEAF to 
derive the following equations for precision PNM 
and recall RNM for CONE CEAF:

In order to support the hypothesis that CONE 
metrics evaluated using (GNM, ONM) represent an 
effective substitute for standard metrics that use 
(G, O), we compute entity level correlation be-
tween the corresponding CONE and standard 
metrics. For example, in the case of CEAF / 
CONE CEAF Precision, we calculate correlation 
between the following quantities: 
??? }{

We perform this experiment with the LBJ and 
BART CRR systems on the ACE Phase 2 corpus. 
We illustrate the correlation results in Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1. Correlation between NMP? andP?  - 
Entity Level CEAF Precision 
From Figure 1, we can see that the two 
measures are highly correlated. In fact, we find 
that the Pearson?s correlation coefficient (Soper 
et al, 1917; Cohen, 1988) is 0.73. The points 
lining up on the x-axis and y=1.0 represent very 
small equivalence classes and are a form of noise; 
their removal doesn?t affect this coefficient. To 
show that this strong correlation is not a 
statistical anomaly, we also compute entity-level 
correlation using (Gi - G
NM
i, Oj - O
NM
j) and (Gi, 
Oj) instead of (G
NM
i, O
NM
j) and (Gi, Oj) and find 
that the coefficient drops to 0.03, which is 
obviously not correlated at all.  
We now know NMP? andP?  are highly correlated. 
Assume the correlation is linear, with the 
following equation: 
?? ?? iNMi PP  
where ? and ? are the linear regression 
parameters. 
Thus 
? ? ???? nPnPPP NM
i
iNM
i i
????? ??
   
Here, n is the number of equivalence classes.    
We conclude that the overall CEAF Precision 
and CONE CEAF Precision should be highly 
140
correlated too. We repeat this experiment with 
CEAF / CONE CEAF Recall, B3 / CONE B3 
Precision and B3 / CONE B3 Recall and obtain 
similar results, allowing us to conclude that these 
sets of measures should also be highly correlated. 
We note here some generally accepted 
terminology regarding correlation: If two 
quantities have a Pearson?s correlation 
coefficient greater than 0.7, they are considered  
"strongly correlated", if their correlation is 
between 0.5 and 0.7, they are considered "highly 
correlated", if it is between 0.3 and 0.5, they are 
considered "correlated", and otherwise they are 
considered "not correlated".  
It is important to note that like all automatic 
evaluation metrics, CONE B3 and CONE CEAF 
too can be easily ?cheated?, e.g. a NE-CRR sys-
tem that performs NER and named entity match-
ing well but does not even detect and classify 
anaphora or nominal mentions would nonethe-
less score highly on these metrics. A possible 
solution to this problem would be to create gold 
standard annotations for a small subset of the 
data, call these annotations G?, and report two 
scores: B3 / CEAF (G?), and CONE B3 / CONE 
CEAF (GNM-approx). Discrepancies between these 
two scores would enable the detection of such 
?cheating?. A related point is that designers of 
NE-CRR systems should not optimize for CONE 
metrics alone, since by using GNM-approx (or GNM 
where gold standard annotations are available), 
these metrics are obviously biased towards 
named mentions. This issue can also be ad-
dressed by having gold standard annotations G? 
for a small subset. One could then train a system 
by optimizing both B3 / CEAF (G?) and CONE 
B3 / CONE CEAF (GNM-approx). This can be 
thought of as a form of semi-supervised learning, 
and may be useful in areas such as domain adap-
tation, where we could use some annotated test-
set in a standard domain, e.g. newswire as the 
smaller set and an unlabeled large testset from 
some other domain, such as e-mail or biomedical 
documents. An interesting future direction is to 
monitor the effectiveness of our metrics over 
time. As co-reference resolution systems evolve 
in strength, our metrics might be less effective, 
however this could be a good indicator to discri-
minate on different subtasks the improvements 
gained by the co-reference resolution systems. 
5 Experimental Results 
We present experimental results in support of the 
validity and effectiveness of CONE metrics. As 
mentioned earlier, we used the following four 
publicly available CRR systems: UIUC?s LBJ 
system (L), BART from JHU Summer Workshop 
(B), LingPipe from Alias-i (LP), and OpenNLP 
(OP) (Bengston and Roth, 2007; Versley et al, 
2008; Baldridge and Torton, 2004; Baldwin and 
Carpenter, 2003). All these CRR systems per-
form Noun Phrase co-reference resolution (NP-
CRR), not NE-CRR. So, we must first eliminate 
all equivalences classes that do not contain any 
named mentions. We do so using the SYNERGY 
NER system to separate named mentions from 
unnamed ones. Note that this must not be con-
fused with the use of SYNERGY to produce GNM 
and ONM from G and O respectively. For that task, 
all equivalence classes in G and O already con-
tain at least one named mention and we remove 
all unnamed mentions from each class. This 
process effectively converts the NP-CRR results 
of these systems into NE-CRR ones. We use the 
ACE Phase 2 NWIRE and ACE 2005 English 
datasets. We avoid using the ACE 2004 and 
MUC6 datasets because the UIUC LBJ system 
was trained on ACE 2004 (Bengston and Roth, 
2008), while BART and LingPipe were trained 
on MUC6. There are 29 files in the test set of 
ACE Phrase 2 and 81 files in ACE 2005, sum-
ming up to 120 files with around 50,000 tokens 
with 5000 valid co-reference mentions. Tables 1 
and 2 show the Pearson?s correlation coefficients  
between CONE metric scores of the type 
Score(GNM, ONM) and standard metric scores of 
the type Score(G, O) for combinations of various 
CRR systems and datasets.

Table 2. GNM: Correlation on ACE 2005 
 
We observe from Tables 1 and 2 that CONE B3 
and CONE CEAF scores are highly correlated 
141
with B3 and CEAF scores respectively, and this 
holds true for Precision, Recall and F1 scores, for 
all combinations of CRR systems and datasets. 
This justifies our assumption that a system?s per-
formance for the subtask of NMEG is a good 
predictor of its performance for the full task of 
NE-CRR. These correlation coefficients are 
graphically illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. 
We now use our baseline named entity matching 
method to automatically generate estimated gold 
standard annotations GNM-approx and recalculate 
CONE CEAF and CONE B3 scores using GNM-
approx instead of GNM. Tables 3 and 4 show the 
correlation coefficients between the new CONE 
scores and the standard metric scores.

Table 4. GNM-approx: Correlation on ACE Phase 2 
We observe from Tables 3 and 4 that these corre-
lation factors are encouraging, but not as good as 
those in Tables 1 and 2. All the corresponding 
CONE B3 and CONE CEAF scores are corre-
lated, but very few are highly correlated. We 
should note however that our baseline system to 
create GNM-approx uses relatively simple clustering 
methods and heuristics. It is easy to observe that 
a sophisticated named entity matching system 
would produce a GNM-approx that better approx-
imates GNM than our baseline method, and CONE 
B3 and CONE CEAF scores calculated using this 
GNM-approx would be more correlated with stan-
dard B3 and CEAF scores.  
We note from the above results that correlations 
scores are very similar across different systems 
and datasets. In order to formalize this assertion, 
we calculate correlation scores in a system-
independent and data-independent manner. We 
combine all the data points across all four differ-
ent systems and plot them in Figure 2 and 3 for 
ACE Phase 2 NWIRE corpus and in Figure 4 and 
5 for ACE 2005 corpus respectively. We illu-
strate only F1 scores; the results for precision 
and recall are similar.

B3 F1 for all systems on ACE 2 
 
Figure 3. Correlation between CEAF F1 and 
CONE CEAF F1 for all systems on ACE 2 
 
Figure 2 reflects a Pearson?s correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.70, suggesting that all the B3 F1 and 
CONE B3 F1 scores for different systems are 
highly correlated and that CONE B3 F1 does not 
bias towards any particular system. Figure 3 re-
flects a Pearson?s correlation coefficient of 0.83, 
providing similar evidence for the system-
independence of correlation between CEAF F1 
and CONE CEAF F1 scores. Figures 4 and 5 
corresponding to ACE 2005 reflect similar corre-
lation coefficients of 0.89 and 0.82, and thus 
support the idea that the correlations between B3 
F1 and CONE B3 F1, as well as between CEAF 
F1and CONE CEAF F1, are dataset-independent 
in addition to being system-independent.

6 Application and Discussion  
To illustrate the applicability of CONE metrics, 
we consider the Enron e-mail corpus. It is of a 
different genre than the newswire corpora that 
CRR systems are usually trained on, and no CRR 
gold standard annotations exist for it. Conse-
quently, no CRR systems have been evaluated on 
it so far. We used CONE B3 and CONE CEAF to 
evaluate and compare the NE-CRR performance 
of various CRR systems on a subset of the Enron 
e-mail corpus (Klimt and Yang, 2004) that was 
cleaned and stripped of spam messages. We re-
port the results in Table 5. 
 
  CONE B3  CONE CEAF 
  P R F1 P R F1 
L 0.43 0.21 0.23 0.31 0.17 0.21 
B 0.26 0.18 0.2 0.26 0.16 0.2 
LP 0.61 0.51 0.53 0.58 0.53 0.54 
OP 0.19 0.03 0.05 0.11 0.02 0.04 
Table 5. GNM-approx Scores on Enron corpus 
 
We find that LingPipe is the best of all the sys-
tems we considered, and LBJ is slightly ahead of 
BART in all measures. We suspect that since 
LingPipe is a commercial system, it may have 
extra training resources in the form of non-
traditional corpora. Nevertheless, we believe our 
method is robust and scalable for large corpora 
without NE-CRR gold standard annotations. 
 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
We propose the CONE B3 and CONE CEAF me-
trics for automatic evaluation of Named Entity 
Co-reference Resolution (NE-CRR). These me-
trics measures a NE-CRR system?s performance 
on the subtask of named mentions extraction and 
grouping (NMEG) and use it to estimate the sys-
tem?s performance on the full task of NE-CRR. 
We show that CONE B3 and CONE CEAF 
scores of various systems across different data-
sets are strongly correlated with their standard B3 
and CEAF scores respectively. The advantage of 
CONE metrics compared to standard ones is that 
instead of the full gold standard data G, they only 
require a subset GNM of named mentions which 
even if not available can be closely approximated 
by using a state-of-the-art NER system and clus-
tering its results. Although we use a simple base-
line algorithm for producing the approximate 
gold standard GNM-approx, CONE B3 and CONE 
CEAF scores of various systems obtained using 
this GNM-approx still prove to be correlated with 
their standard B3 and CEAF scores obtained us-
ing the full gold standard G. CONE metrics thus 
reduce the need of expensive labeled corpora. 
We use CONE B3 and CONE CEAF to evaluate 
the NE-CRR performance of various CRR sys-
tems on a subset of the Enron email corpus, for 
which no gold standard annotations exist and no 
such evaluations have been performed so far. In 
the future, we intend to use more sophisticated 
named entity matching schemes to produce better 
approximate gold standards GNM-approx. We also 
intend to use the CONE metrics to evaluate NE-
CRR systems on new datasets in domains such as 
chat, email, biomedical literature, etc. where very 
few corpora with gold standard annotations exist.
