ABSTRACT 
The structure imposed upon spoken sentences 
by intonation seems frequently to be orthogo- 
hal to their traditional surface-syntactic struc- 
ture. However, the notion of "intonational struc- 
ture" as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, 
and others, can be subsumed under a rather dif- 
ferent notion of syntactic surface structure that 
emerges from a theory of grammar based on a 
"Combinatory" extension to Categorial Gram, 
mar. Interpretations of constituents at this level 
are in tam directly related to "information struc- 
ture", or discourse-related notions of "theme", 
"rheme", "focus" and "presupposition". Some 
simplifications appear to follow for the problem 
of integrating syntax and other high-level mod- 
ules in spoken language systems. 
One quite normal prosody (13, below) for an answer 
to the following question (a) intuitively impotes the 
intonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress, 
marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated by 
capitals): 
(1) a. I know that Alice prefers velveL 
But what does MAry prefer? 
b. (MAry prefers) (CORduroy). 
Such a grouping is orthogonal to the traditional syn- 
tactic structure of the sentence. 
Intonational structure nevertheless remains trongly 
constrained by meaning. For example, contours im- 
posing bracketings like the following are not allowed: 
(2) #(Three cats)(in ten prefer corduroy)

Halliday \[6\] observed that this constraint, which 
Selkirk \[14\] has called the "Sense Unit Condition", 
seems to follow from the function of phrasal into- 
nation, which is to convey what will here be called 
"information structure" - that is, distinctions of focus, 
presupposition, and propositional ttitude towards en- 
floes in the discourse model. These discourse ntities 
are more diverse than mere nounphrase or proposi- 
tional referents, but they do not include such non- 
concepts as "in ten prefer corduroy." 
Among the categories that they do include are what 
Wilson and Sperber and E. Prince \[13\] have termed 
"open propositions". One way of introducing an open 
proposition into the discourse context is by asking a 
Wh-question. For example, the question in (1), What 
does Mary prefer? introduces an open proposition. 
As Jackendoff \[7\] pointed out, it is natural to think 
of this open proposition as a functional abstraction, 
and to express it as follows, using the notation of the 
A-calculus: 
(3) Ax \[(prefer' x) mary'\] 
(Primes indicate semantic interpretations whose de- 
tailed nature is of no direct concern here.) When 
this function or concept is supplied with an argu- 
ment corduroy', it reduces to give a proposition, with 
the same function argument relations as the canonical 
sentence: 
(4) (prefer' corduroy') mary' 
It is the presence of the above open proposition rather 
than some other that makes the intonation contour in 
(1)b felicitous. (l~at is not to say that its presence 
uniquely determines this response, nor that its explicit 
mention is necessary for interpreting the response.) 
These observations have led linguists such as 
Selkirk to postulate a level of "intonational struc- 
ture", independent of syntactic structure and re- 
lated to information structure. The theory 
that results can be viewed as in Figure 1: 
directionality of their arguments and the type of their 
result:

The involvement of two apparently uncoupled lev- 
els of structure in natural language grammar appears 
to complicate the path from speech to interpretation 
unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number of 
computational applications in speech recognition and 
speech synthesis. 
It is therefore interesting to observe that all natu- 
ral languages include syntactic onstructions whose 
semantics i  also reminiscent of functional abstrac- 
tion. The most obvious and tractable class are Wh- 
constructions themselves, in which exactly the same 
fragments that can be delineated by a single intona- 
tion contour appear as the residue of the subordinate 
clause. Another and much more problematic class of 
fragments results from coordinate constructions. It is 
striking that the residues of wh-movement and con- 
junction reduction are also subject o something like 
a "sense unit condition". For example, strings like 
"in ten prefer corduroy" are not conjoinable: 
(5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet, 
and in ten prefer corduroy. 
Since coordinate constructions have constituted an- 
other major source of complexity for theories of nat- 
ural language grammar, and also offer serious ob- 
stacles to computational pplications, it is tempt- 
ing to think that this conspiracy between syntax and 
prosody might point to a unified notion of structure 
that is somewhat different from traditional surface 
constituency. 
COMBINATORY GRAMMARS. 
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, \[16\]) is an 
extension of Categorial Grammar (CG). Elements like 
verbs are associated with a syntactic "category" which 
identifies them as functions, and specifies the type and 
(6) prefers := (S \NP) /NP  : prefer' 
The category can be regarded as encoding the seman- 
tic type of their translation, which in the notation used 
here is identified by the expression to the right of the 
colon. Such functions can combine with arguments 
of the appropriate ype and position by functional ap- 
plication: 
(7) Mary prefers  corduroy 
I/P (S\NP)/NP NP 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  > 
S\PIP 
. . . . . . . . . . . . .  < 
s 
Because the syntactic types are identical to the se- 
mantic types, apart form directionality, the deriva- 
tion also builds a compositional interpretation, 
(prefer' corduroy') mary', and of course such a 
"pure" categorial grammar is context free. Coordina- 
tion might be included in CG via the following rule, 
allowing constituents of like type to conjoin to yield 
a single constituent of the same type: 
(8) X conj X ::~ X 
(9) I l oath  and detest  ve lvet  
NP (S\NP)/NP conj (S\NP)//~P NP 
.It 
Cs \m' ) /~  
(The rest of the derivation is omitted, being the same 
as in (7).) In order to allow coordination of con- 
tiguons strings that do not constitute constituents, 
CCG generalises the grammar to allow certain op- 
erations on functions related to Curry's combinators 
\[3\]. For example, functions may nondeterministically 
compose, as well as apply, under the following rule: 
(10) Forward Composition: 
X /Y  : F Y /Z  : G =~, X /Z  : Ax F(Gz) 
The most important single property of combinatory 
rules like this is that they have an invariant semantics. 
This one composes the interpretations of the functions 
that it applies to, as is apparent from the right hand 
side of the rule. 1 Thus sentences like I suggested, 
tThe rule uses the notation ofthe ,~-calculus in the semantics, 
for clarity. This should not obscure the fact hat it is functional 
composition itself that is the primitive, not the ,~ operator. 
10 
and would prefer, corduroy can be accepted, via the 
following composition of two verbs (indexed as B, 
following Curry's nomenclature) to yield a composite 
of the same category as a transitive verb. Crucially, 
composition also yields the appropriate interpretation 
for the composite verb would prefer:

Combinatory grammars also include type-raising 
rules, which turn arguments into functions over 
functions-over-such-arguments. The e rules allow ar- 
guments to compose, and thereby take part in coordi- 
nations like I suggested, and Mary prefers, corduroy. 
They too have an invariant compositional semantics 
which ensures that the result has an appropriate inter- 
pretation. For example, the following rule allows the 
conjuncts to form as below (again, the remainder of 
the derivation is omitted):

This apparatus has been applied to a wide variety of 
coordination phenomena (cf. \[4\], \[15\]). 
INTONATION AND CONTEXT 
Examples like the above show that combinatory gram- 
mars embody a view of surface structure according 
to which strings like Mary prefers are constituents. It 
follows, according to this view, that they must also be 
possible constituents of non-coordinate s ntences like 
Mary prefers corduroy, as in the following derivation:

(See \[9\], \[18\] and \[19\] for a discussion of the ob- 
vious problems for parsing written text that the pres- 
ence of such "spurious" (i.e. semantically equivalent) 
derivations engenders, and for some ways they might 
be overcome.) An entirely unconstrained combina- 
tory grammar would in fact allow any bracketing on 
a sentence, although the grammars we actually write 
for configurational l nguages like English are heavily 
constrained by local conditions. (An example might 
be a condition on the composition rule that is tacitly 
assmned below, forbidding the variable Y in the com- 
position rule to be instantiated asNP, thus excluding 
constituents like .\[ate the\]v P/N). 
The claim of the present paper is simply that par- 
ticular surface structures that are induced by the spe- 
cific combinatory grammar that are postulated to ex- 
plain coordination in English subsume the intona- 
tional structures that are postulated by Pierrehumbert 
et al to explain the possible intonation contours for 
sentences of English. More specifically, the claim is 
that that in spoken utterance, intonation helps to de- 
termine which of the many possible bracketings per- 
mitted by the combinatory syntax of English is in- 
tended, and that the interpretations of the constituents 
that arise from these derivations, far from being "spu- 
rious", are related to distinctions of discourse focus 
among the concepts and open propositions that the 
speaker has in mind. 
The proof of this claim lies in showing that the 
rules of combinatory grammar can be made sensitive 
to intonation contour, which limit their application i  
spoken discourse. We must also show that the major 
constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under 
the analyses that are permitted by any given intona- 
tion, correspond to the information structure of the 
context o which the intonation is appropriate, as in 
(a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins. 
This demonstration will be quite simple, once we have 
established the following notation for intonation con- 
tours .  
I shall use a notation which is based on the theory 
of Pierrehumbert \[10\], as modified in more recent 
work by Selkirk \[14\], Beckman and Pierrehumbert 
\[1\], \[11\], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg \[12\]. I
have tried as far as possible to take my examples and 
the associated intonational nnotations from those au- 
thors. The theory proposed below is in principle com- 
patible with any of the standard escriptive accounts 
of phrasal intonation. However, a crucial feature of 
Pierrehumberts heory for present purposes is that 
it distinguishes two subcomponents of the prosodic 
phrase, the pitch accent and the boundary. 2 The 
first of these tones or tone-sequences coincides with 
the perceived major stress or stresses of the prosodic 
phrase, while the second marks the righthand bound- 
ary of the phrase. These two components are essen- 
tially invariant, and all other parts of the intonational 
tune are interlx)lated. Pierrehumberts theory thus cap- 
tures in a very natural way the intuition that the same 
tune can be spread over longer or shorter strings, in 
order to mark the corresponding constituents for the 
particular distinction of focus and propositional tti- 
tude that the melody denotes. It will help the exposi- 
tion to augment Pierrehumberts notation with explicit 
prosodic phrase boundaries, using brackets. These do 
not change her theory in any way: all the information 
is implicit in the original notation. 
Consider for example the prosody of the sentence 
Fred ate the beans in the following pair of discourse 
settings, which are adapted from Jackendoff \[7, pp. 
260\]: 
(15) Q: I /e l1 ,  what about  the  BEAns? 
Who ate  THEM? 
A : FRED ate  the  BEA-ns. 
( H* L ) (  L+H* LHg ) 
two tunes are reversed: this time the tune with pitch 
accent T.+H* and boundary LH% is spread across a 
prosodic phrase Fred ate, while the other tune with 
pitch accent H* and boundary LL% is carried by the 
prosodic phrase the beans (again starting with an in- 
terpolated or null tone). 4
The meaning that these tunes convey is intuitively 
very obvious. As Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg point 
out, the latter tune seems to be used to mark some or 
all of that part of the sentence expressing information 
that the speaker believes to be novel to the hearer. In 
traditional terms, it marks the "comment" - more pre- 
cisely, what Halliday called the '~rheme'. In contrast, 
the r.+H* LH% tune seems to be used to mark some 
or all of that part of the sentence which expresses in- 
formation which in traditional terms is the "topic" -
in I-lalliday's terms, the "theme". 5 For present pur- 
poses, a theme can be thought of as conveying what 
the speaker assumes to be the subject of mutual inter- 
est, and this particular tune marks a theme as novel 
to the conversation as a whole, and as standing in 
a contrastive relation to the previous one. (If the 
theme is not novel in this sense, it receives no tone 
in Pierrehumbert's erms, and may even be left out 
altogether.) 6 Thus in (16), the L+H* Lrt% phrase in- 
cluding this accent is spread across the phrase Fred 
ate. 7 Similarly, in (15), the same tune is confined to 
the object of the open proposition ate the beans, be- 
cause the intonation of the original question indicates 
that eating beans as opposed to some other comestible 
is the new topic, s
(16) q: I /e l l ,  what about  FRED? 
What did HE eat7 
A: FRED ate the BEAns. 
( L+H* LH~ )( H* LL~ ) 
In these contexts, the main stressed syllables on both 
Fred and the beans receive a pitch accent, but a dif- 
ferent one. In the former example, (15), there is a 
prosodic phrase on Fred made up of the pitch accent 
which Pierrehumbert calls H*, immediately followed 
by an r. boundary. There is another prosodic phrase 
having the pitch accent called L+H* on beans, pre- 
ceded by null or interpolated tone on the words ate 
the, and immediately followed by a boundary which 
is written LH%. (I base these annotations on Pierre- 
humber and Hirschberg's \[12, ex. 33\] discussion of 
this example.) 3 In the second example (16) above, the 
2For the purpose s of this abstract, I am ignoring the distinction 
between the intonational phrase proper, and what Pierrehumben 
and her colleagues call the "intermediate" phrase, which differ in 
respect of boundary tone-sequences. 
3I continue to gloss over Pierrehumbert's di tinction between 
*'intermediate" and "intonational" phrases. 
COMBINATORY PROSODY 
The r,+H* r,H% intonational melody in example (16) 
belongs to a phrase Fred ate ... which corresponds 
under the combinatory theory of grammar to a gram- 
4The reason for notating the latter boundary as LLg, rather than 
L is again to do with the distinction between intonational nd in- 
termediate phrases. 
5The concepts of theme and rheme are closely related to Grosz 
et als \[5\] concepts of "backward looking center" and "forward 
looking center". 
6Here I depart slightly from Halliday's definition. The present 
paper also follows Lyons \[8\] in rejecting Hallidays' claim that the 
theme must necessarily be sentence-initial. 
ran  alternative prosody, in which the contrastive tune is con- 
fined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and may be the one intended 
by Jackendoff. I befieve that his altemative is informationally dis- 
tinct, and arises from an ambiguity as to whether the topic of this 
discourse is Fred or What Fred ate. It too is accepted by the rules 
below. 
SNore that the position of the pitch accent in the phrase has to 
do with a further dimension of information structure within both 
theme and theme, which me might identify as "focus': I ignore 
this dimension here.

matical constituent, complete with a translation equiv- 
alent to the open proposition Az\[(ate' z) fred'\]. The 
combinatory theory thus offers a way to derive such 
intonational phrases, using only the independently 
motivated rules of combinatory grammar, entirely un- 
der the control of appropriate intOnation contOurs like 
L+H*  LH%. 9 
It is extremely simple tO make the existing combi- 
natory grammar do this. We interpret the two pitch 
accents as functions over boundaries, of the following 
types: I0 
(17) L+H*  := Theme/Bh 
H*  := Rheme/B l  
- that is, as functions over boundary tOnes into the 
two major informational types, the Hallidean "theme" 
and "rheme". The reader may wonder at this point 
why we do not replace the category Theme by a 
functional category, say Ut terance /Rheme,  cor- 
responding to its semantic type. The answer is that 
we do not want this category to combine with any- 
thing but a complete rheme. In particular, it must not 
combine with a function into the category Rheme 
by functional composition. Accordingly we give it 
a non-functional category, and supply the following 
special purpose prosodic ombinatory rules: 
(18) Theme Rheme =~ Ut terance  
Rheme Theme =~ Ut terance  
We next define the various boundary tOnes as ar- 
guments to these functions, as follows: 
(19) LH% := Bh  
LL% := B1 
L := B1 
(As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distinc- 
tion between intermediate- and intonational- phrase 
boundaries.) Finally, we accomplish the effect of in- 
terpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning the 
following polymorphic category to all elements bear- 
ing no tOne specification, which we will represent as 
the tOne 0: 
(20) 0 := x /x  
9I am grateful to Steven Bird for discussions on the following 
proposal. 
1?An alternative (which would actually be closer to Pierrchum- 
bert and Hirschberg's own proposal to compositionally assemble 
discourse meanings from more primitive lements of meaning car- 
fled by each individual tone) would be to make the boundary tone 
the function and the pitch accent an argument. 
13 
Syntactic ombination can then be made subject o 
the following simple restriction: 
(21) The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Com- 
bination of two syntactic ategories via a 
syntactic ombinatory ule is only allowed if 
their prosodic ategories can also combine. 
(The prosodic and syntactic ombinatory rules need 
not be the same). 
This principle has the sole effect of excluding cer- 
tain derivations for spoken utterances that would be 
allowed for the equivalent written sentences. For ex- 
ample, consider the derivations that it permits for ex- 
ample (16) above. The rule of forward composition is
allowed tO apply tO the words Fred and ate, because 
the prosodic categories can combine (by functional 
application): 
(22) Fred ate ...

The category x /x  of the null tone allows intonational 
phrasal tunes like T,+H* LH% tune tO spread across 
any sequence that forms a grammatical constituent 
according to the combinatory grammar. For example, 
if the reply to the same question What did Fred eat? 
is FRED must have eaten the BEANS, then the tune 
will typically be spread over Fred must have eaten .... 
as in the following (incomplete) derivation, in which 
much of the syntactic and semantic detail has been 
omitted in the interests of brevity:

The rest of the derivation of (16) is completed as 
follows, using the first rule in ex. (18):

Utterance 
The division of the utterance into an open proposition 
constituting the theme and an argument constituting 
the rheme is appropriate to the context established in
(16). Moreover, the theory permits no other deriva- 
tion for this intonation contour. Of course, repeated 
application of the composition rule, as in (23), would 
allow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in 
(FRED must have eaten)(the BEANS). 
In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden by 
the prosodic onstituent condition for the alternative 
intonation contour on (15). Instead, the following 
derivation, excluded for the previous example, is now 
allowed: 
(25) Fred ate the beans

Utterance 
No other analysis is allowed for (25). Again, the 
derivation divides the sentence into new and given in- 
formation consistent with the context given in the ex- 
ample. The effect of the derivation is to annotate the 
entire predicate as an L+H* LH%. It is emphasised 
that this does not mean that the tone is spread, but that 
the whole constituent is marked for the corresponding 
discourse function - -  roughly, as contrastive given, 
or theme. The finer grain information that it is the ob- 
ject that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides 
in the tree itself. Similarly, the fact that boundary se- 
quences are associated with words at the lowest level 
of the derivation does not mean that they are part 
of the word, or specified in the lexicon, nor that the 
word is the entity that they are a boundary of. It is 
14 
prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also are 
defined by the tree. 
All the other possibilities for combining these two 
contours on this sentence are shown elsewhere \[17\] 
to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriate 
interpretations. 
Sentences like the above, including marked 
theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intona- 
tionalAntermediate phrases are by that token unam- 
biguous as to their information structure. However, 
sentences like the following, which in Pierrehum- 
berts' terms bear a single intonational phrase, are 
much more ambiguous as to the division that they 
convey between theme and rheme: 
(26) I read a book about CORduroy 
( H*  LL% ) 
Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to the 
open proposition it presupposes, for it seems equally 
apropriate as a response to any of the following ques- 
tions: 
(27) a. What did you read a book about? 
b. What did you read? 
c. What did you do? 
Such questions could in suitably contrastive contexts 
give rise to themes marked by the L+H* LH% tune, 
bracketing the sentence as follows: 
(28) a. (1 read a book about)(CORduroy) 
b. (I read)(a book about CORduroy) 
c. (I)(read a book about CORduroy) 
It seems that we shall miss a generalisation concern- 
ing the relation of intonation to discourse information 
unless we extend Pierrehumberts theory very slightly, 
to allow null intermediate phrases, without pitch ac- 
cents, expressing unmarked themes. Since the bound- 
aries of such intermediate phrases are not explicitly 
marked, we shall immediately allow all of the above 
analyses for (26). Such a modification to the theory 
can be introduced by the following rule, which non- 
deterministically allows certain constituents bearing 
the null tone to become a theme: 
(29) r. r~ 
X/X ::~ Theme 
The symbol E is a variable ranging over syntactic 
categories that are (leftward- or rightward- looking) 
functions into S. al The rule is nondeterministic, so it 
correctly continues to allow a further analysis of the 
entire sentence as a single Intonational Phrase convey- 
ing the Rheme. Such an utterance is the appropriate 
response to yet another open-proposition establishing 
question, What happened?.) 
With this generalisation, we are in a position to 
make the following claim: 
(30) The structures demanded by the theory of in- 
tonation and its relation to contextual infor- 
marion are the same as the surface syntac- 
tic structures permitted by the combinatory 
grammar. 
A number of corollaries follow, such as the following: 
(31) Anything which can coordinate can be an 
intonational constituent, and vice versa. 
CONCLUSION 
The pathway between phonological form and inter- 
pretation can now be viewed as in Figure 2:

Figure 2: Architecture of a CCG-based Prosody 
Such an architecture is considerably simpler than the 
one shown earlier in Figure 1. Phonological form 
maps via the rules of combinatory grammar directly 
onto a surface structure, whose highest level con- 
stituents correspond to intonational constituents, an- 
notated as to their discourse function. Surface struc- 
ture therefore subsumes intonational structure. It also 
subsumes information structure, since the translations 
of those surface constituents correspond to the enti- 
ties and open propositions which constitute the topic 
or theme (if any) and the comment or rheme. These in 
11The inclusion in the full grammar of further oles of type- 
raising in addition to the subject rule discussed above means that 
the set of categories over which ~ ranges is larger than it is possible 
to reveal in the present paper. (For example, it includes object 
complements). See the earlier papers and \[17\] for digcussion.

turn reduce via functional application to yield canon- 
ical function-argument structure, or "logical form". 
There may be significant advantages for automatic 
spoken language understanding in such a theory. 
Most obviously, where in the past parsing and phono- 
logical processing have tended to deliver conflicting 
structural analyses, and have had to be pursued inde- 
pendently, they now are seen to be in concert. That is 
not to say that intonational cues remove all local struc- 
tural ambiguity. Nor should the problem of recognis- 
ing cues like boundary tones be underestimated, for 
the acoustic realisation in the fundamental frequency 
F0 of the intonational tunes discussed above is en- 
tirely dependent upon the rest of the phonology -
that is, upon the phonemes and words that bear the 
tune. It therefore seems most unlikely that intona- 
tional contour can be identified in isolation from word 
recognition. 12 
What the isomorphism between syntactic structure 
and intonational structure does mean is that simply 
structured modular processors which use both sources 
of information at once can be more easily devised. 
Such an architecture may reasonably be expected to 
simplify the problem of resolving local structural am- 
biguity in both domains. For example, a syntactic 
analysis that is so closely related to the structure of 
the signal should be easier to use to "filter" the am- 
biguities arising from lexical recognition. 
However, it is probably more important hat the 
constituents that arise under this analysis are also 
semantically interpreted. The interpretations are di- 
rectly related to the concepts, referents and themes 
that have been established in the context of discourse, 
say as the result of a question. These discourse n- 
tities are in turn directly reducible to the structures 
involved in knowledge-representation and inference. 
The direct path from speech to these higher levels of 
analysis offered by the present theory should therefore 
make it possible to use more effectively the much 
more powerful resources of semantics and domain- 
specific knowledge, including knowledge of the dis- 
course, to filter low-level ambiguities, using larger 
grammars of a more expressive class than is cur- 
rently possible. While vast improvements in purely 
bottom-up word recognition can be expected to con- 
rinue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to suc- 
cessful speech processing by machine, and appears to 
be characteristic of all levels of human processing, 
for both spoken and written language. 
12This is no bad thing. The converse also applies: intonation 
contour effects the acoustic r alisation ofwords, particularly with 
respect o timing. It is therefore likely that he benefits of combin- 
ing intonational recognition a d word recognition will be mutual.
