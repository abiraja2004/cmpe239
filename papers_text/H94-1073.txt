ABSTRACT 
We show how the recognition performance of a speech recog- 
nition component in a speech retrieval system affects the 
retrieval effectiveness. A speech retrieval system facilitates 
content-based retrieval of speech documents, i.e. audio 
recordings containing spoken text. The speech retrieval pro- 
cess receives queries from users and for every query it ranks 
the speech documents in decreasing order of their probabil- 
ities that they are relevant o the query. The speech recog- 
nition component is an important part of a speech retrieval 
system, since it detects the occurrences of indexing features 
in the documents. Because the recognition of indexing fea- 
tures in continuous peech is error prone, the question arises 
how much an error prone recognition of indexing features af- 
fects the retrieval effectiveness. As an answer to this question 
and main contribution of this paper we simulated the recog- 
nition of indexing features in speech documents on standard 
information retrieval test collections and show the resulting 
retrieval accuracies. 
1. In t roduct ion  
We show how the recognition performance of a speech recog- 
nition component in a speech retrieval system affects the 
retrieval effectiveness. A speech retrieval system facilitates 
content-based retrieval of speech documents, i.e. audio 
recordings containing spoken text \[5\]. The speech retrieval 
process receives queries from users and for every query it 
ranks the speech documents in decreasing order of their prob- 
abilities that they are relevant o the query. These probabil- 
ities are derived from the occurrences of indexing features 
that were identified in the speech documents by a speech 
recognition component \[4\]. Because the recognition of index- 
ing features in continuous peech is error prone, the question 
arises how much an error prone recognition of indexing fea- 
tures affects the retrieval effectiveness. 
The indexing features used in our speech retrieval system 
are phonetically motivated subword units having an inter- 
mediate specificity. The general pattern of an indexing fea- 
ture is a maximum sequence of consonants enclosed by two 
maximum sequences of vowels at both ends. We call these 
indexing features VCV-features where C stands for the maxi- 
mum sequence of consonants and V stands for the maximum 
sequence of vowels. As an example, the word INTERNA- 
T IONAL contains the VCV-features INTE, ERNA, ATIO, 
and IONA. The indexing vocabulary is defined to be the set 
of those VCV-featutes ~,i whose inverse document frequen- 
cies idf(~oi) are between a lower bound id fmi ,  and an up- 
per bound idf, no,  such that the indexing features are neither 
370 
very specific nor very broad. The lower bound guarantees 
the suitability for indexing and the upper bound guarantees 
the trainability, i.e. there are enough examples to train the 
8MMs. Experiments on standard information retrieval test 
collections howed that when using an appropriate subset of 
only 1000 VCV-features we can achieve a retrieval effective- 
ness that is comparable to standard weighted retrieval which 
is based on a much larger indexing vocabulary \[4\]. In addition 
to the VCV-features, we have also studied indexing vocab- 
ularies that have been extended by CV- and VC-features at 
the word boundaries 
The recognition of speech documents i carried out with stan- 
dard speech recognition technology, i.e. a wordspotter \[6\], 
\[11\], \[14\] locates the occurrences of indexing features in doc- 
uments. For each document in the collection we create a 
description vector based on the number of occurrences of 
each feature and use a conventional retrieval function \[12\] 
to estimate the similarity between a document and a query 
description. 
Our indexing features consisting of VCV-features can be iden- 
tified in both text and speech documents. As a consequence, 
the document collection may contain a mixture of text and 
speech documents. Furthermore, the query may also be en- 
tered as either text or speech. The controlled indexing vocab- 
ulary consisting of selected VCV-features has the advantage 
that the document description can be computed before the 
query evaluation. In particular, an access structure (e.g. an 
inverted file) can be constructed to allow fast query evalua- 
tion. Another important advantage of our indexing vocabu- 
lary for both text and speech retrieval is that speech retrieval 
can simulated by using text collections as described in the 
subsequent sections. 
Information Retrieval on audio documents has been investi- 
gated very little. A wordspotting system for voice indexing 
was developed by Wilcox and Bush \[14\] and an information 
retrieval system that classifies peech messages was presented 
by Rose, Chang, and Lippmann \[10\]. Recently a project for 
video mail retrieval using voice was proposed by Olivetti re- 
search Limited, Cambridge University Engineering Depart- 
ment, and Cambridge University Computer Laboratory \[7\]. 
The effects of recognition errors on on the retrieval effective- 
ness has been studied in the context of OCR based Informa- 
tion Retrieval \[1\]. These results are not directly comparable 
because speech retrieval performance may be considerably 
affected by false alarms in contrast o OCR-based retrieval 
where false alarms can be ignored because the occur infre- 
quently.

of the reference method, i.e. a standard text retrieval method. 
The main contribution of this paper is the conclusion that 
speech retrieval is feasible to some extent even when the 
recognition performance is poor. A closer look reveals that 
recognition errors and occurrences of query features in the 
documents have different distributions and standard retrieval 
methods are quite good in distinguishing these two distribu- 
tions. The next two sections describe the test setting and the 
results respectively. Then, some conclusions are drawn. 
2. Test  Set t ing  
The experiments are performed by means of the the standard 
information retrieval text collections CRANFIELD, MED- 
LAtLS, and CACM \[2\]. The indexing vocabulary consists of 
the VCV-, CV-, and VC-features ~i whose inverse document 
frequency 
n+l  1)  idf(~,) := log k df(~i) S r
is between the lower bound idfmin := 1.6 and an upper bound 
idfma~ which is chosen such that the indexing vocabulary 
consists of exactly 1000 features. Every indexing feature ~i 
and every document dj is assigned a weight 
aij := ff(cPi, dj) * idf(~i). 
371 
Analogously, every indexing feature ~i is assigned a weight 
bi := ff(~i,q)*idf(~oi) 
with respect o a given query q. As usual, the documents 
are presented to the user in decreasing order of the Retrieval 
Status Values RSV(q, dj) that are determined by the cosine 
measure. 
~ i  aid * bi RSV(q, d~) := 
The recognition errors were simulated in three steps. First, 
a parser converts a text document into a sequence of index- 
ing features by detecting VCV-, CV-, and VC-features that 
belong to the indexing vocabulary. Second, the sequence of 
indexing features i converted into another sequence of index- 
ing features by removing features as follows. For every feature 
in the input sequence it is randomly determined whether it is 
recognized or not. If it is recognized, the feature is included 
in the output sequence; otherwise, it is removed. The prob- 
ability that a feature is recognized is equal to the specified 
detection rate. Third, the reduced sequence of indexing fea- 
tures is converted into a final sequence by adding indexing 
features as follows. Assume that the original document con- 
sists of k occurrences of a word. According to \[8\], an average 
speaker needs approximately k/170 minutes or At := k/1020 
hours for such a document with k word occurrences. We 
then add! fa * At occurrences of every indexing feature where 
f a denolLes the specified false alarms per keltword per hour. 
For simplicity, every indexing feature is assumed to have the 
same detection rate and false alarms. 
3. Results 
Table 1 shows the average precision values for various detec- 
tion rates and false alarm rates. The numbers in brackets 
represent he percentage of a average precision of the ref- 
erence method. The reference method represents a standard 
text retrieval method which is based on words rather than on 
VCV-features. In our case here, the reference method uses 
van Rijsbergen's \[13\] stoplist to eliminate the high-frequency 
words. Furthermore, it uses the word reduction algorithm by 
Porter \[9\] to reduce different variants of a words to the same 
normal form. The term weights consist of simple t f  * idf 
weights and the retrieval status values are obtained by the 
cosine measure. 
Current wordspotting systems report high detection rates 
and low false alarms for the recognition of entire words in 
speech documents \[2\],\[3\],\[4\]. These systems, however, are 
usually evaluated on small tasks: the vocabulary of the 
speech database is in the order of 1000 words and the num- 
ber of words spotted is small. On the other hand, the task to 
identify 1000 VCV-features in speech documents with an un- 
limited vocabulary is much more difficult and the correspond- 
ing false alarms are one to two orders of magnitude higher. 
We therefore consider detection rates within the range of 40% 
and 90% and false alarms per keyword (i.e. per indexing fea~ 
ture) per hour within the range of 0 and 140. 
4. Conclusions 
We have shown that speech retrieval is feasible to some extent 
even when the recognition performance is poor. It should be 
noted that a retrieval effectiveness which is moderate because 
of recognition errors may well be in the range of the retrieval 
effectiveness of the commonly used boolean retrieval method. 
In the case of MEDLARS, for instance, the boolean retrieval 
method achieves a retrieval effectiveness which corresponds 
to 40 % detection rate and 140 false alarms per indexing 
feature per hour \[3\]. It seems that recognition errors and oc- 
currences of query features in the documents have different 
distributions and standard retrieval methods are quite good 
in distinguishing these two distributions. Further investiga- 
tions are needed to study the influence of the length of the 
queries and the length of the documents.
