Abstract
Methods that re-use existing mono-lingual
semantic annotation resources to annotate
a new language rely on the hypothesis that
the semantic annotation scheme used is
cross-lingually valid. We test this hypoth-
esis in an annotation agreement study. We
show that the annotation scheme can be
applied cross-lingually.
1 Introduction
It is hardly a controversial statement that elegant
language subtleties and powerful linguistic im-
agery found in literary writing are lost in trans-
lation. Yet, translation preserves enough meaning
across language pairs to be useful in many appli-
cations and for many text genres.
The belief that this layer of meaning which is
preserved across languages can be formally rep-
resented and automatically calculated underlies
methods that use parallel corpora for the automatic
generation of semantic annotations through cross-
lingual transfer (Pado?, 2007; Basili et al, 2009).
A methodology similar in spirit ? re-use of the
existing resources in a different language ? has
also been applied in developing manually anno-
tated resources. Monachesi et al (2007) annotate
Dutch sentences using the PropBank annotation
scheme (Palmer et al, 2005), while Burchardt et
al. (2009) use the FrameNet framework (Fillmore
et al, 2003) to annotate a German corpus. In-
stead of building special lexicons containing the
specific semantic information needed for the an-
notation for each language separately, which is a
complex and time-consuming endeavour in itself,
these approaches rely on the lexicons already de-
veloped for English.
In this paper, we hypothesize that the level
of abstraction that is necessary to develop a se-
mantic lexicon/ontology for a single language
based on observable linguistic behaviour ? that
is a mono-lingual, item-specific annotation ? is
cross-linguistically valid. We test this hypothe-
sis by manually annotating French sentences using
the PropBank frame files developed for English.
It has been claimed that semantic parallelism
across languages is smaller when using the
PropBank semantic annotations instead of the
FrameNet scheme, because FrameNet is more ab-
stract and less verb-specific (Pado?, 2007). We are
working with the PropBank annotation scheme,
contrary to other works that use the FrameNet
scheme, such as Pado? (2007) and Basili et al
(2009). We choose this annotation for two main
reasons. First, the primary use of our annotation is
to serve as a gold standard in the task of syntactic-
semantic parsing. FrameNet does not have a prop-
erly sampled hand-annotated corpus of English,
by design. So we cannot use it for this task. Sec-
ond, in Merlo and Van der Plas (2009), the seman-
tic annotations schemes of PropBank and VerbNet
(Kipper, 2005) are compared, based on annotation
of the SemLink project (Loper et al, 2007). The
authors conclude that PropBank is the preferred
annotation for a joint syntactic-semantic setting.
If the PropBank annotation scheme is cross-
lingually valid, annotators can reach a consensus
and can do so swiftly. Thus, cross-lingual valid-
ity is measured by how well-defined the manual
annotation task is (inter-annotator agreement) and
by how hard it is to reach an agreement (pre- and
post-consensus inter-annotator agreement). In ad-
dition, we measure the impact of the level of ab-
straction of the predicate labels. Conversely, how
often labels do not transfer and distributions of dis-
agreements are indicators of lack of parallelism
across languages that we study both by quantita-
tive and qualitative analysis.
To preview the results, we find that the Prop-
Bank annotation scheme developed for English
can be applied for a large portion of French sen-
113
tences without adjustments, which confirms its
cross-lingual validity. A high level of inter-
annotator agreement is reached when the verb-
specific PropBank labels are replaced by less fine-
grained verb classes after annotating. Non-parallel
cases are mostly due to idioms and collocations.
2 Materials and Methods
Our choices of formal representation and of la-
belling scheme are driven by the goal of produc-
ing useful annotations for syntactic-semantic pars-
ing in a setting based on an aligned corpus. In the
following subsections we describe the annotation
scheme and procedure, the corpus, and phases of
annotation.
2.1 The PropBank Annotation Framework
We use the PropBank scheme for the manual anno-
tations. PropBank is a linguistic resource that con-
tains information on the semantic structure of sen-
tences. It consists of a one-million-word corpus
of naturally occurring sentences annotated with
semantic structures and a lexicon (the PropBank
frame files) that lists all the predicates (verbs) that
can be found in the annotated sentences and the
sets of semantic roles they introduce.
Predicates are marked with labels that specify
the sense of the verb in the particular sentence. Ar-
guments are marked with the labels A0 to A5. The
labels A0 and A1 have approximately the same
value with all verbs. They are used to mark in-
stances of typical AGENTS (A0) and PATIENTS
(A1). The value of other numbers varies across
verbs. Modifiers are annotated in PropBank with
the label AM. This label can have different exten-
sions depending on the semantic type of the con-
stituent, for example locatives and adverbials.
2.2 Annotation Procedure
Annotators have access to PropBank frame files
and guidelines adapted for the current task. The
frame files provide verb-specific descriptions of all
possible semantic roles and illustrate these roles
with examples as shown for the verb paid in (1)
and the verb senses of pay in Table 1. Annotators
need to look up each verb in the frame files to be
able to label it with the right verb sense and to be
able to allocate the arguments consistently.

[REL?PAY.01 paid] [A1 very little] [A3 on its
debt] [AM?TMP since early last year].
Frame Semantic roles
pay.01 A0: payer or buyer
A1: money or attention
A2: person being paid, destination of attention
A3: commodity, paid for what
pay.02 A0: payer
pay off A1: debt
A2: owed to whom, person paid
pay.03 A0: payer or buyer
pay out A1: money or attention
A2: person being paid, destination of attention

pay.04 A1: thing succeeding or working out
pay.05 A1: thing succeeding or working out
pay off
pay.06 A0: payer
pay down A1: debt
Table 1: The PropBank lexicon entry for pay.
In our cross-lingual setting, annotators used
the English PropBank frame files to annotate the
French sentences. This means that for every pred-
icate they find in the French sentence, they need
to translate it, and find an English verb sense that
is applicable to the French verb. If an appropri-
ate entry cannot be found in the frame files for a
given predicate, the annotator is instructed to use
the ?dummy? label for the predicate and fill in the
roles according to their own insights.
For the annotation of sentences we use an adap-
tation of the user-friendly, freely available Tree
Editor (TrEd, Pajas and S?te?pa?nek, 2008). The tool
shows the syntactic analysis and the plain sentence
in the same window allowing the user to add se-
mantic arcs and labels to the nodes in the syntactic
dependency tree.
The decision to show syntactic information is
merely driven by the fact that we want to guide the
annotator in selecting the heads of phrases during
the annotation process. The sentences are parsed
by a syntactic parser (Titov and Henderson, 2007)
that we trained on syntactic dependency annota-
tions for French (Candito et al, 2009). Although
the parser is state-of-the-art (87.2% Labelled At-
tachment Score), in case of parse errors, we ask
annotators to ignore the errors of the parser and
put the label on the actual head.
2.3 Corpus
We selected the French sentences for the man-
ual annotation from the parallel Europarl corpus
(Koehn, 2005). Because translation shifts are
known to pose problems for the automatic cross-
lingual transfer of semantic roles (Pado?, 2007)
and for machine translation (Ozdowska and Way,
114
2009), and these are more likely to appear in in-
direct translations, we decided to select only those
parallel sentences, for which we can infer from the
labels used in Europarl that they are direct trans-
lations from English to French, or vice versa. We
selected 1040 sentences for annotation (40 in to-
tal for the two training phases, 100 for calibration,
and 900 for the main annotation phase.)1
2.4 Annotation Phases
The training procedure described in Figure 1
is inspired by the methodology indicated in
Pado? (2007). A set of 130 sentences were anno-
tated manually by four annotators with very good
proficiency in both French and English for the
training and the calibration phase. The remaining
900 sentences are annotated by one annotator (out
of those four), a trained linguist. Inter-annotator
agreement was measured at several points in the
annotation process marked with an arrow in Fig-
ure 1. The guidelines were adjusted after the train-
ing phase.

3 Results
Cross-lingual validity is measured by comparing
inter-annotator agreement at several stages in the
annotation, by measuring the agreement on less
specific predicate labelling, and by a quantitative
and qualitative analysis of non-parallel cases.
3.1 Inter-annotator Agreement for Several
Annotation Phases
To assess the quality of the manual annotations we
measured the agreement between annotators as the
average F-measure of all pairs of annotators after
each phase of the annotation procedure.2 The first
1As usual practice in preprocessing for automatic align-
ment, the datasets were tokenised and lowercased and only
sentence pairs corresponding to a 1-to-1 alignment with
lengths ranging from 1 to 40 tokens on both French and En-
glish sides were considered.

ing the kappa score is problematic in categorisation tasks that

Table 2: Percent inter-annotator agreement (F-
measure) for labelled/unlabelled predicates and

row of Table 2 shows that the task is hard. But
the difference between the first row and the sec-
ond row shows that there were many differences
between annotators that could be resolved. After
discussions and individual corrections the scores
are between 91% and 95%. This indicates that
the task is well-defined. Row three shows that the
agreement in the calibration phase increases a lot
compared to the last training phase (row 1). This
might in part be due to the fact that the guidelines
were adjusted by the end of the training phase, but
could also be because the annotators are getting
more acquainted to the task and the software.
As expected, because annotators used the En-
glish PropBank frame files to annotate French
verbs, the task of labelling predicates proved more
difficult than labelling semantic roles. It results in
the lowest agreement scores overall. In the follow-
ing subsections we study the sources of disagree-
ment in predicate labelling in more detail.
3.2 Inter-annotator Agreement in Predicate
Labellings
Predicate labels in PropBank apply to particular
verb senses, for example walk.01 for the first sense
of the verb walk. Even though the senses are
coarser than, for example, the senses in Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998), the labels are rather spe-
cific. This specificity possibly poses problems
when working in a cross-lingual setting.
We compare the agreement reached using Prop-
Bank verb sense labels with the agreement reached
using the verb classifications from VerbNet (Kip-
per, 2005) and the mapping to PropBank labels
as provided in the type mappings of the SemLink
project3 (Loper et al, 2007). If two annotators
used two different predicate labels to annotate the
do not have a fixed number of items and categories (Burchardt
et al, 2006). The F-measure is a well-known measure used
for the evaluation of many task such as syntactic-semantic
parsing, the task that is the motivation for this paper. The
choice of the F-measure makes the comparison to the perfor-
mance of the future parser easier.

same verb, but those verb senses belong to the
same verb class, we count those as correct4.
The average inter-annotator agreement is rela-
tively low when we compare the annotations on
the PropBank verb sense level: 59%. However, at
the level of verb classes, the inter-annotator agree-
ment increases to 81%. This raises the issue of
whether we should not label the predicates with
verb classes instead of verb senses. By using Prop-
Bank labels for the manual annotation and replac-
ing these with verb classes in post-processing, the
benefits are two-fold: We are able to reach a high
level of cross-lingual parallelism on the annota-
tions, while keeping the manual annotation task as
specific and less abstract as possible.
3.3 Analysis of Non-Parallel Cases
For a single annotator, the main measure of cross-
lingual validity is the percentage of dummy pred-
icates in the annotation. In the sentences from the
calibration and the main annotation phase from the
main annotator (1000 sentences in total), we find
130 predicates (tokens) for which the annotator
used the ?dummy? label.
Manual inspection reveals that the ?dummy? la-
bel is mainly used for French multi-word expres-
sions (82%), most of which can be translated by
a single English verb (47%), whereas others can-
not, because they are translated by a combination
that includes a form of ?be? that is not annotated
in PropBank (25%). The 47% of multi-word ex-
pressions that receive the ?dummy? label show the
annotator?s reluctance to put a single verb label on
a French multi-word expression. The annotation
guidelines could be adapted to instruct annotators
not to hesitate in such cases.
Similarly, collocations and idiomatic expres-
sions are the main sources of disagreement in
predicate labellings among annotators. We can
conclude that, as shown in studies on other lan-
guage pairs (Burchardt et al, 2009), collocations
and idiomatic expressions were identified as verb
uses where the verb?s predicate label cannot be
transferred directly from one language to another.
4 Discussion and Related Work
Burchardt et al (2009) use English FrameNet to
4The mappings from PropBank verb sense labels to Verb-
Net verb classes are one-to-many and not complete. We
counted a pair as matching if there exists a class to which
both verb senses belong. We found a verb class for both verb
senses in about 78% of the cases and discarded the rest.
annotate a corpus of German sentences manually.
They find that the vast majority of frames can be
applied to German directly. However, around one
third of the verb senses identified in the German
corpus were not covered by FrameNet. Also, a
number of German verbs were found to be under-
specified. Finally, some problems related to treat-
ing particular verb uses were identified, such as id-
ioms, metaphors, and support verb constructions.
Monachesi et al (2007) use PropBank labels for
semi-automatic annotation of a corpus of Dutch
sentences. Semantic roles were first annotated
using a rule-based semantic parser and then cor-
rected by one annotator. Although not all Dutch
verbs could be translated to an equivalent verb
sense in English, these cases were assessed as rel-
atively rare. What proved to be problematic was
identifying the correct label for modifiers.
Bittar (2009) makes use of cross-lingual lexi-
cal transfer in annotating French verbs with event
types, by adapting a small-scale English verb lex-
icon with specified event structure (TimeML).
The inter-annotator agreement in labelling pred-
icates reported in Burchardt et al (2009) reaches
85%, while our best score (when falling back to
verb classes) is 81%. However, unlike Burchardt
et al (2009) we did not introduce any new French
labels. We find, like Monachesi et al (2007), that
non-parallel cases are less frequent than what is re-
ported in Burchardt et al (2009), which could be
due to the properties of the annotations schemes.
5 Conclusions
We can conclude that the general task of anno-
tating French sentences using English PropBank
frame files is well-defined. Nevertheless, it is a
hard task that requires linguistic training. With re-
spect to the disagreements on labelling predicates,
we can conclude that a large part can be resolved
if we compare the annotations at the level of verb
classes instead of at the very fine-grained level of
verb senses. Non-parallel cases are mostly due to
idioms and collocations. Their rate is relatively
low and can be further reduced by adapting anno-
tation guidelines.
