Abstract
The R2D2 systems for the English All-Words and
Lexical Sample tasks at SENSEVAL-3 are based on
several supervised and unsupervised methods com-
bined by means of a voting procedure. Main goal
was to take advantage of training data when avail-
able, and getting maximum coverage with the help
of methods that not need such learning examples.
The results reported in this paper show that super-
vised and unsupervised methods working in par-
allel, and a simple sequence of preferences when
comparing the answers of such methods, is a feasi-
ble method. . .
The whole system is, in fact, a cascade of deci-
sions of what label to assign to a concrete instance
based on the agreement of pairs of systems, when
it is possible, or selecting the available answer from
one of them. In this way, supervised are preferred to
unsupervised methods, but these last ones are able
to tag such words that not have available training
data.
1 Introduction
Designing a system for Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) requires a large knowledge on language
structure, morphology, syntax, semantics and prag-
matic nuances. All of these different linguistic
knowledge forms, however, have a common asso-
ciated problem, their many ambiguities, which are
difficult to resolve.
In this paper we concentrate on the resolution
of the lexical ambiguity that appears when a given
word in a context has several different meanings.
? This paper has been partially supported by the Spanish
Government (CICyT) under project number TIC-2003-7180
and the Valencia Government (OCyT) under project number
CTIDIB-2002-151
This specific task is commonly referred as Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD). This is a difficult
problem that is receiving a great deal of attention
from the research community because its resolu-
tion can help other NLP applications as Machine
Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR), Text
Processing, Grammatical Analysis, Information Ex-
traction (IE), hypertext navigation and so on.
The R2D2 Team has participated in two tasks:
English all-words and lexical sample. We use sev-
eral different systems both supervised and unsuper-
vised. The supervised methods are based on Max-
imum Entropy (ME) (Lau et al, 1993; Berger et
al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998), neural network using
the Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (Koho-
nen, 1995) and Specialized Hidden Markov Mod-
els (Pla, 2000). The unsupervised methods are Rel-
evant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al, 2003) and
the CIAOSENSO WSD system which is based on
Conceptual Density (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), fre-
quency of WordNet (Miller et al, 1993a) senses and
WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000).
In the following section we will show a more
complete description of the systems. Next, how
such methods were combined in two voting sys-
tems, and the results obtained in SENSEVAL-3. Fi-
nally, some conclusions will be presented.
2 Systems description
In this section the systems that have participated at
SENSEVAL-3 will be described.
2.1 Maximum Entropy
ME modeling provides a framework for integrating
information for classification from many heteroge-
neous information sources (Manning and Schu?tze,
1999). ME probability models have been success-
                                             Association for Computational Linguistics
                        for the Semantic Analysis of Text, Barcelona, Spain, July 2004
                 SENSEVAL-3: Third International Workshop on the Evaluation of Systems
fully applied to some NLP tasks, such as POS tag-
ging or sentence boundary detection (Ratnaparkhi,
1998). ME have been also applied to WSD (van
Halteren et al, 2001; Montoyo and Sua?rez, 2001;
Sua?rez and Palomar, 2002), and as meta-learner in
(Ilhan et al, 2001).
Our ME-based system has been shown competi-
tive (Ma`rquez et al, 2003) when compared to other
supervised systems such as Decision Lists, Support
Vector Machines, and AdaBoost. The features that
were defined to train the system are those described
in Figure 1.
? the target word itself
? lemmas of content-words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? words at positions ?1, ?2,
? words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? content-words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? POS-tags of words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? lemmas of collocations at positions (?2,?1),
(?1,+1), (+1,+2)
? collocations at positions (?2,?1), (?1,+1),
(+1,+2)
? lemmas of nouns at any position in context, occur-
ring at least m% times with a sense
? grammatical relation of the target word
? the word that the target word depends on
? the verb that the target word depends on
? the target word belongs to a multi-word, as identi-
fied by the parser
Figure 1: Features Used for the Supervised Learn-
ing of the ME system
Because the ME system needs annotated data
for the training, Semcor (Miller et al, 1993b) was
used for the English All-Words task, the system
was trained using Semcor (Miller et al, 1993b), and
parsed by Minipar (Lin, 1998). Only those words
that have 10 examples or more in Semcor were pro-
cessed in order to obtain a ME classifier.
For the Spanish Lexical Sample task, the train-
ing data from SENSEVAL-3 was the source of la-
beled examples. We did not use any parser, just the
lemmatization and POS-tagging information sup-
plied into the training data itself.
2.2 UPV-SHMM-AW
The upv-shmm-aw WSD system is a supervised ap-
proach based on Specialized Hidden Markov Mod-
els (SHMM).
Basically, a SHMM consists of changing the
topology of a Hidden Markov Model in order to get
a more accurate model which includes more infor-
mation. This is done by means of an initial step
previous to the learning process. It consists of the
redefinition of the input vocabulary and the output
tags. This redefinition is done by means of two pro-
cesses which transform the training set: the selec-
tion process chooses which input features (words,
lemmas, part-of-speech tags, ...) are relevant to the
task, and the specialization process redefines the
output tags by adding information from the input.
This specialization produces some changes in the
model topology, in order to allow the model to bet-
ter capture some contextual restrictions and to get a
more accurate model.
We used as training data the part of the Sem-
Cor corpus that is semantically annotated and su-
pervised for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs,
and the test data set provided by SENSEVAL-2.
We used 10% of the training corpus as a develop-
ment data set in order to determine the best selection
and specialization criteria.
In the experiments, we used WordNet1.6 (Miller
et al, 1993a) as a dictionary that supplies all the
possible semantic senses for a given word. Our sys-
tem disambiguated all the polysemic lemmas, that
is, the coverage of our system was 100%. For un-
known words (words that did not appear in the train-
ing data set), we assigned the first sense in WordNet.
2.3 Relevant Domains
This is an unsupervised WSD method based on the
WordNet Domains lexical resource (Magnini and
Cavaglia, 2000). The underlaying working hypoth-
esis is that domain labels, such as ARCHITEC-
TURE, SPORT and MEDICINE provide a natural
way to establish semantic relations between word
senses, that can be used during the disambiguation
process. This resource has already been used on
Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strappa-
rava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses infor-
mation. So our approach make use of a new lexical
resource obtained from glosses information named
Relevant Domains.
First step is to obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source from WordNet glosses. For this task is nec-
essary a previous part-of-speech tagging of Word-
Net glosses (each gloss has associated a domain la-
bel). So we extract all nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs from glosses and assign them their associ-
ated domain label. With this information and using
the Association Ratio formula(w=word,D=domain
label), in (1), we obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source.
AR(w,D) = Pr(w|D)log2Pr(w|D)Pr(w) (1)
The final result is for each word, a set of domain
labels sorted by Association Ratio, for example,
for word plant? its Relevant Domains are: genetics
0.177515, ecology 0.050065, botany 0.038544 . . . .
Once obtained Relevant Domains the disam-
biguation process is carried out. We obtain from
the text source the context words that co-occur with
the word to be disambiguated (context could be
a sentence or a window of words). We obtain a
context vector from Relevant Domains and context
words (in case of repeated domain labels, they are
weighted). Furthermore we need a sense vector ob-
tained in the same way as context vector from words
of glosses of each word sense. We select the cor-
rect sense using the cosine measure between con-
text vector and sense vectors. So the selected sense
is that for which the cosine with the context vector
is closer to one.
2.4 LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS
The LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS system (Garc??a-Vega et al,
2003) is based on a supervised learning algorithm
for WSD. The method trains a neural network using
the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm
(Kohonen, 1995), integrating Semcor and several
semantic relations of WordNet.
The Vector Space Model (VSM) is used as an in-
formation representation model. Each sense of a
word is represented as a vector in an n-dimensional
space where n is the number of words in all its con-
texts.
We use the LVQ algorithm to adjust the word
weights. The input vector weights are calculated
as shown by (Salton and McGill, 1983) with the
standard (tf ? idf). They are presented to the LVQ
network and, after training, the output vectors are
obtained, containing the adjusted weights for all
senses of each word.
Any word to disambiguate is represented with a
vector in the same way. This representation must be
compared with all the trained sense vectors of the
word by applying the cosine similarity rule:
sim(wk, xi) = wk ? xi| wk | ? | xi | (2)
The sense corresponding to the vector of highest
similarity is selected as the disambiguated sense.
To train the neural network we have inte-
grated semantic information from two linguistic re-
sources: SemCor1.6 corpus and WordNet1.7.1 lex-
ical database. From Semcor1.6 we used the para-
graph as a contextual semantic unit and each con-
text was included in the training vector set. From
WordNet1.7.1 some semantic relations were consid-
ered, specifically, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy,
homonymy, hyperonymy, meronymy, and coordi-
nate terms. This information was introduced to the
training set through the creation of artificial para-
graphs with the words of each relation. So, for a
word with 7 senses, 7 artificial paragraphs with the
synonyms of the 7 senses were added, 7 more with
all its hyponyms, and so on.
The learning algorithm is very simple. First, the
learning rate and the codebook vectors are initial-
ized. Then, the following procedure is repeated for
all the training input vectors until a stopping crite-
rion is satisfied:
- Select a training input pattern, x, with class d,
and present it to the network
- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the in-
put vector and each codebook vector || x? wk ||
- Select the codebook vector, wc, that is closest to
the input vector, x, like the winner sense.
- The winner neuron updates its weights accord-
ing the learning equation:
wc(t+ 1) = wc(t) + s ? ?(t) ? [x(t)? wc(t)] (3)
where s = 0, if k 6= c; s = 1, if x(t) and wc(t)
belong to the same class (c = d); and s = ?1, if
they do not (c 6= d). ?(t) is the learning rate, and
0 < ?(t) < 1 is a monotically decreasing func-
tion of time. It is recommended that ?(t) should
already initially be rather small, say, smaller than
0.1 (Kohonen, 1995) and ?(t) continues decreasing
to a given threshold, u, very close to 0.
2.5 CIAOSENSO
The CIAOSENSO WSD system is an unsupervised
system based on Conceptual Density, the frequency
of WordNet sense, and WordNet Domains. Concep-
tual Density is a measure of the correlation among
the sense of a given word and its context. The
noun sense disambiguation is performed by means
of a formula combining the Conceptual Density
with WordNet sense frequency (Rosso et al, 2003).
The context window used in both the English all-
words and lexical sample tasks is of 4 nouns. Ad-
ditional weights are assigned to those senses hav-
ing the same domain as the context nouns? senses.
Each weight is proportional to the frequency of such
senses, and is calculated as MDW (f, i) = 1/f ?1/i
where f is an integer representing the frequency
of the sense of the word to be disambiguated and
i gives the same information for the context word.
Example: If the word to be disambiguated is doc-
tor, the domains for senses 1 and 4 are, respec-
tively, Medicine and School. Therefore, if one of
the context words is university, the resulting weight
for doctor(4) and university(3) is 1/4 ? 1/3.
The sense disambiguation of an adjective is per-
formed only on the basis of the above weights.
Given one of its senses, we extract the synsets ob-
tained by the similar to, pertainym and attribute
relationships. For each of them, we calculate the
MDW with respect to the senses of the context
noun. The weight assigned to the adjective sense
is the average between these MDWs. The se-
lected sense is the one having the maximum average
weight.
The sense disambiguation of a verb is done nearly
in the same way, but taking into consideration only
the MDWs with the context words. In the all-words
task the context words are the noun before and af-
ter the verb, whereas in the lexical sample task the
context words are four (two before and two after the
verb), without regard to their morphological cate-
gory. This has been done in order to improve the
recall in the latter task, for which the test corpus is
made up mostly by verbs.
The sense disambiguation of adverbs (in both
tasks) is carried out in the same way of the disam-
biguation of verbs for the lexical sample task.
3 Tasks Processing
We have selected several combinations of such sys-
tems described before for two voting systems, one
for the Lexical-Sample task and the other for the
All-Words task.
3.1 English Lexical Sample Task
At the English Lexical Sample task we combined
the answers of four systems: Relevant Domains,
CIAOSENSO, LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS and Maximum En-
tropy.
The four methods worked in parallel and their
sets of answers were the input of a majority voting
procedure. This procedure selected those answers
with more systems agreements. In case of tie we
gave priority to supervised systems.
With this voting system we obtained around a
63% precision and a 52% recall.
3.2 English All Words Task
For this task we used a voting system combining
the results of Relevant Domains, Maximum En-
tropy, CIAOSENSO and UPV-SHMM-AW. So we
obtained the final results after 10 steps.
Step 1, we selected those answers with agree-
ment between ME and UPV-SHMM-AW (super-
vised systems).
Step 2, from no agreement in step 1 we selected
those answers with agreement between ME and Rel-
evant Domains.
Step 3, from no agreement in step 2 we selected
those answers with agreement between ME and
CIAOSENSO.
Step 4, from no agreement in step 3 we se-
lected those answers with agreement between
CIAOSENSO and UPV-SHMM-AW.
Step 5, from no agreement in step 4 we se-
lected those answers with agreement between UPV-
SHMM-AW and Relevant Domains.
Step 6, from no agreement in step 5 we selected
those answers with agreement between Relevant
Domains and CIAOSENSO.
Step 7, from no agreement in step 6 we selected
Maximum Entropy answers.
Step 8, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected UPV-SHMM-AW answers.
Step 9, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected Relevant Domains answers.
Step 10, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected CIAOSENSO answers.
Last step was labeling with the most frequent
sense in WordNet those instances that had been not
tagged by any system, but in view of the final results
only two instances had not answer and we didn?t
find them in WordNet.
With this voting system preference was given to
supervised systems over unsupervised systems.
We obtained around a 63% precision and a 63%
recall.
4 Conclusions
This paper presents the main characteristics of
the Maximum Entropy, LVQ-JAEN-ELS, UPV-
SHMM-AW, Relevant Domains and CIAOSENSO
systems within the framework of SENSEVAL-3 En-
glish Lexical Sample and All Words tasks. These
systems are combined with a voting technique ob-
taining a promising results for English All Words
and English Lexical Sample tasks.
