i. The following paper Js based on work done in the 
multi-lingual MT-project EUROTRA, an MT-pro~ect of 
the European Community. 
Analysis and generation of clauses within the 
EUROTRA-framework proceeds through the levels of 
(at least) EUROTRA constituent structure (ECS), 
EUROTRA relational structure (ERS) and interface 
structure (IS) (cf. Arnold/des Tombe/Jaspaert.1985 
and the EUROTRA-REFERENCE MANUAL, version I, 
revision 0). 
At IS, labelling of nodes consists of labellings for 
time, modality, semantic features, semantic relations 
and others. In this paper, we shalI be concerned 
exclusively with semantic relations (SRs), to which 
we shall also refer as "participant roles" (PR). A 
list of EUROTRA SRs as given in ELS-3 is reproduced 
beiow:

According to current EUROTRA legislation, these gRs 
are assigned to dictionary entries of verbs (and 
other word classes, which will be disregarded in this 
paper) by coders, and through these entries to 
clauses in a pattern matching process. 
This approach, while certainly valid in principle, 
leads to the problem of inter-coder-consistency, at 
least as long as the means for identifying SRs are 
paraphrase tests for SRs. In EUROTRA-D, we have for 
some time now been experimenting with a set of SRs, 
or PRs, which are identified with tile help of 
syntactic criteria. This approach will be outlined in 
the following. Its roots, are to be found in the 
literature on semantic cases in general (cf. 
Fillmore.1968 and 1977, Starosts 1977, Somers.198B) 
and more particularly, in ideas from Systemic 
Linguists (cf. Fawcett.1980 and forthcoming, 
HaIliday.1967-68 and \]985, Sl:einer.1983 and 1985, 
Winograd. 1983). 
2. Definition of basic concepts 
To start with, we need a small set of basic concepts, 
which will be define(\[ in the following. There is a 
basic distinction between Participant Roles and 
Circumstantial Roles on the semantic \]eve\], which the 
ELS-3 specifications do not contain. There is the 
further distinction between inherent and non-inherent 
roles, which is also not explicitly made in ELS-3 and 
may be necessary at some point. 
Participant Role: A participant role is a semantic 
constituent of a clause which is syntactically 
reaIized as a complement rather than as a modifier. 
Circumstantial Role: A circumstantial role is a 
semantic constituent which is, on clause level, 
realized as a modifier rather than as a complement 
~ o q ~  Participant Role: A semantic constituent 
which is, on clause level, realized as obligatory 
complement 
O~iona l  Participant Role: A semantic constituent 
which is, on clause level, realized as an optional 
complement 
Inherent Role: Inherent roles are obligatory 
participant roles and those participant roles which, 
Jf they are not realized in a clause, lead to look 
up in the preceding text or situation for a referent, 
Cf,: (20) David wax watching.

Not) I nherent  Role:  Non : inherenL ro les  are those 
participant roles wh\]eh, \[\[ Lhey #Ire not realized \]n 
the clause+ do not lead to look up, Cf.: (21) \])evJd

5. Conclusion 
The statements in this paper are necessarily very 
sketchy and brief. More detailed information will be 
given in the oral presentation. 
The assignment of semantic relations, as presented 
here, has been worked out for German in some detail. 
The available literature for English, especially in 
the work of Fawcett and Halliday, shows that the 
treatment of English in the same way does not present 
a major problem. It seems to be reasonable to assume 
that the method outlined constitutes a worthwhile 
way to explore for a multi-lingual MT-project such as 
EUROTRA. 
Acknowledgements: I am very grateful to my colleagues 
in EUROTRA-D for many critical comments on my work. 
Most indebted, though, I am to Robin P. Fawcett for 
many hours of discussion and explorations. Needless 
to say, that the responsibility for any weaknesses 
in form and content rest with the author alone.
