Abstract
This paper introduces Vignette Semantics, a
lexical semantic theory based on Frame Se-
mantics that represents conceptual and graph-
ical relations. We also describe a lexical re-
source that implements this theory, VigNet,
and its application in text-to-scene generation.
1 Introduction
Our goal is to build a comprehensive text-to-
graphics system. When considering sentences such
as John is washing an apple and John is washing
the floor, we discover that rather different graphical
knowledge is needed to generate static scenes rep-
resenting the meaning of these two sentences (see
Figure 1): the human actor is assuming different
poses, he is interacting differently with the thing be-
ing washed, and the water, present in both scenes,
is supplied differently. If we consider the types of
knowledge needed for scene generation, we find that
we cannot simply associate a single set of knowl-
edge with the English verb wash. The question
arises: how can we organize this knowledge and
associate it with lexical items, so that the resulting
lexical knowledge base both is usable in a wide-
coverage text-to-graphics system, and can be pop-
ulated with the required knowledge using limited re-
sources?
In this paper, we present a new knowledge base
that we use for text-to-graphics generation. We dis-
tinguish three types of knowledge needed for our
task. The first is conceptual knowledge, which is
knowledge about concepts, often evoked by words.
For example, if I am told John bought an apple, then
I know that that event necessarily also involved the
seller and money. Second, we need world knowl-

FRUIT vignette (?John washes the apple?) and WASH-

edge. For example, apples grow on trees in cer-
tain geographic locations at certain times of the year.
Third, we need grounding knowledge, which tells
us how concepts are related to sensory experiences.
In our application, we model grounding knowledge
with a database of 3-dimensional graphical models.
We will refer to this type of grounding knowledge
as graphical knowledge. An example of grounding
knowledge is knowing that several specific graphical
models represent apple trees.
Conceptual knowledge is already the object of ex-
tensive work in frame semantics; FrameNet (Rup-
penhofer et al, 2010) is an extensive (but not com-
plete) relational semantic encoding of lexical mean-
ing in a frame-semantic conceptual framework. We
use this prior work, both the theory and the resource,
in our work. The encoding of world knowledge has
been the topic of much work in Artificial Intelli-
gence. Our specific contribution in this paper is the
integration of the representation for world knowl-
edge and graphical knowledge into a frame-semantic
approach. In order to integrate these knowledge
types, we extend FrameNet in three manners.
1. Frames describe complex relations between
their frame elements, but these relations, i.e.
28
the internal structure of a frame, is not explic-
itly formulated in frame semantics. FrameNet
frames do not have any intensional meaning
besides the informal English definition of the
frames (and what is expressed by so-called
?frame-to-frame relations?). From the point
of view of graphics generation, internal struc-
ture is necessary. While for many applications
a semantic representation can remain vague, a
scene must contain concrete objects and spatial
relations between them.
2. Some frames are not semantically specific
enough. For example, there is a frame
SELF MOTION, which includes both walk and
swim; these verbs clearly need different graph-
ical realizations, but they are also different
from a general semantic point of view. While
this situation could be remedied by extend-
ing the inventory of frames by adding WALK
and SWIM frames, which would inherit from
SELF MOTION, the situation is more complex.
Consider wash an apple and wash the floor,
discussed above. While the core meaning of
wash is the same in both phrases, the graphi-
cal realization is again very different. However,
we cannot simply create two new frames, since
at some level (though not the graphical level)
the meaning is indeed compositional. We thus
need a new mechanism.
3. FrameNet is a lexical resource that illustrates
how language can be used to refer to frames,
which are abstract definitions of concepts, and
their frame elements. It is not intended to be
a formalism for deep semantic interpretation.
The FrameNet annotations show the frame ele-
ments of frames (e.g. the goal frame element of
the SELF MOTION frame) being filled with text
passages (e.g. into the garden) rather than with
concrete semantic objects (e.g. an ?instance?
of a LOCALE BY USE frame evoked by gar-
den). Because such objects are needed in or-
der to fully represent the meaning of a sentence
and to assert world knowledge, we introduce
semantic nodes which are discourse referents
of lexical items (whereas frames describe their
meanings).
In this paper, we present VigNet, a resource which
extends FrameNet to incorporate world and graph-
ical knowledge. We achieve this goal by address-
ing the three issues above. We first extend frames
by adding more information to them (specifically,
about decomposition relevant to graphical ground-
ing and more precise selectional restrictions). We
call a frame with graphical information a vignette.
We then extend the structure defined by FrameNet
by adding new frames and vignettes, for example
for wash an apple. The result we call VigNet. Fi-
nally, we extend VigNet with a system of nodes
which instantiate frames; these nodes we call se-
mantic nodes. They get their meaning only from the
frames they instantiate. All three extensions are con-
servative extensions of frames and FrameNet. The
semantic theory that VigNet instantiates we call Vi-
gnette Semantics and we believe it to be a conser-
vative extension (and thus in the spirit of) frame se-
mantics.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we review frame semantics and FrameNet. Section 3
presents a more detailed description of VigNet, and
we provide examples in Section 4. Since VigNet is
intended to be used in a large-coverage system, the
population of VigNet with knowledge is a crucial is-
sue which we address in Section 5. We discuss re-
lated work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
2 Frame Semantics and FrameNet
Frame Semantics (FS; Fillmore (1982)) is based on
the idea that the meaning of a word can only be fully
understood in context of the entire conceptual struc-
ture surrounding it, called the word?s frame. When
the meaning of a word is evoked in a hearer?s mind
all related concepts are activated simultaneously and
we can rely on this structure to transfer information
in a conversation. Frames can describe states-of-
affairs, events or complex objects. Each frame con-
tains a set of specific frame elements (FEs), which
are labeled semantic argument slots describing par-
ticipants in the frame. For instance, the word buy
evokes the frame for a commercial transaction sce-
nario, which includes a buyer and a seller that ex-
change money for goods. A speaker is aware of what
typical buyers, sellers, and goods are. He may also
have a mental prototype of the visual scenario itself
29
(e.g. standing at a counter in a store). In FS the
role of syntactic theory and the lexicon is to explain
how the syntactic dependents of a word that realizes
a frame (i.e. arguments and adjuncts) are mapped to
frame elements via valence patterns.
FrameNet (FN; Baker et al (1998), Ruppenhofer
et al (2010)) is a lexical resource based on FS.
Frames in FN (around 1000) 1 are defined in terms
of their frame elements, relations to other frames
and semantic types of FEs. Beyond this, the mean-
ing of the frame (how the FEs are related to each
other) is only described in natural language. FN
contains about 11,800 lexical units, which are pair-
ings of words and frames. These come with anno-
tated example sentences (about 150,000) to illustrate
their valence patterns. FN contains a network of
directed frame-to-frame relations. In the INHERI-
TANCE relation a child-frame inherits all semantic
properties from the superframe. The frame rela-
tions SUBFRAME and PRECEDES refer to sub-events
and events following in temporal order respec-
tively. The parent frame?s FEs are mapped to the
child?s FEs. For instance CAUSE TO WAKE inher-
its from TRANSITIVE ACTION and its sleeper FE
maps to agent. Other relations include PERSPEC-
TIVE ON, CAUSATIVE OF, and INCHOATIVE OF.
Frame relations captures important semantic facts
about frames. For instance the hierarchical organi-
zation of INHERITANCE allows to view an event on
varying levels of specificity. Finally, FN contains
a small ontology of semantic types for frame ele-
ments, which can be interpreted as selectional re-
strictions (e.g. an agent frame element must be
filled by a sentient being).
3 Vignette Semantics
In Section 1, we motivated VigNet by the need
for a resource that allows us to relate language to
a grounded semantics, where for us the graphical
representation is a stand-in for grounding. We de-
scribed three reasons for extending FrameNet to Vi-
gNet: we need more meaning in a frame, we need
more frames and more types of frames, and we need
to instantiate frames in a clean manner. We discuss
these refinements in more detail in this section.
1Numbers refer to FrameNet 1.5
? Vignettes are frames that are decomposed into
graphical primitives and can be visualized.
Like other fames they are motivated by frame
semantics; they correspond to a conceptual
structure evoked by the lexical units which are
associated with it.
? VigNet includes individual frames for each
(content) lexical item. This provides finer-
grained semantics than given with FrameNet
frames themselves. These lexically-coupled
frames leverage the existing structure of their
parent frames. For example, the SELF MOTION
frame contains lexical items for run and swim
which have very different meaning even though
they share the same frame and FEs (such as
SOURCE, GOAL, and PATH). We therefore
define frames for RUN and SWIM which in-
herit from SELF MOTION. We assume also that
frames and lexical items that are missing from
FrameNet are defined and linked to the rest of
FrameNet as needed.
? Even more specific frames are created to rep-
resent composed vignettes. These are vi-
gnettes that ground meaning in different ways
than the primitive vignette that they special-
ize. The only motivation for their existence
is the graphical grounding. For example, we
cannot determine how to represent washing an
apple from the knowledge of how to repre-
sent generic washing and an apple. So we de-
fine a new vignette specifically for washing a
small fruit. From the point of view of lexi-
cal semantics, it uses two lexical items (wash
and apple) and their interpretation, but for us,
since we are interested in grounding, it is a
single vignette. Note that it is not necessary
to create specific vignettes for every concrete
verb/argument combination. Because vignettes
are visually inspired relatively few general vi-
gnettes (e.g. manipulate an object on a fixture)
suffices to visualize many possible scenarios.
? A new type of frame-to-frame relation, which
we call SUBFRAME-PARALLEL is used to de-
compose vignettes into a set of more primitive
semantic relations between their arguments.
Unlike FrameNet?s SUBFRAME relation which
30
represents temporally sequential subframes, in
SUBFRAME-PARALLEL, the subframes are all
active at the same time, provide a conceptual
and spatial decomposition of the frame, and can
serve as spatial constraints on the frame ele-
ments. A frame is called a vignette if it can
be decomposed into graphical primitives using
SUBFRAME-PARALLEL relations. For instance
in the vignette WASH-SMALL-OBJ for washing
a small object in a sink, the washer has to be
in front of the sink. We assert a SUBFRAME-
PARALLEL relation between WASH-SMALL-
OBJ and FRONTOF, mapping the washer FE
to the figure FE and sink to ground.
? FrameNet has a very limited number of seman-
tic types that are used to restrict the values
of FEs. Vignette semantics uses selectional
restrictions to differentiate between vignettes
that have the same parent. For example, the
vignette invoked for washing a small object in
a sink would restrict the semantic type of the
theme (the entity being washed) to anything
small, or, more generally, to any object that is
washed in this way (apples, hard-boiled eggs,
etc). The vignette used for washing a vehicle in
a driveway with a hose would restrict its theme
to some set of large objects or vehicle types.
Selectional restrictions are asserted using the
same mechanism as decompositions.
? As mentioned in Section 1, in FrameNet an-
notations frame elements (FEs) are filled with
text spans. Therefore, while frame seman-
tics in general is a deep semantic theory,
FrameNet annotations only represent shallow
semantics and it is not immediately obvious
how FrameNet can be used to build a full se-
mantic representations of a sentence. In Vi-
gnette semantics, when a frame is evoked by
a lexical item, it is instantiated as a semantic
node. Its FEs are then bound not to subphrases,
but to semantic nodes which are the instantia-
tions of the frames evoked by those subphrases.
Section 3.1 investigates semantic nodes in more de-
tail. Section 3.2 illustrates different types of vi-
gnettes (objects, actions, locations) and how they are
defined using the SUBFRAME PARALLEL relation.
In Section 3.3 we discuss selectional restrictions.
3.1 Semantic Nodes and Relational Knowledge
The intuition behind semantic nodes is that they rep-
resent objects, events or situations. They can also
represent plurals or generics. For instance we could
have semantic node city, denoting the class of cities
and a semantic node paris, that denotes the city
Paris. Note that there is also a frame CITY and a
frame PARIS that contain the conceptual structure
associated with the words city and Paris. Frames
represent the linguistic and the conceptual aspect
of knowledge; the intensional meaning of a word.
They provide knowledge to answer questions such
as ?What is an apple?? or ?How do you wash an ap-
ple??. In contrast, semantic nodes are extensional,
i.e. denotations. They represent the knowledge to
answer questions such as ?In what season are apples
harvested?? or ?How did Percy wash that apple just
now??.
As mentioned above semantic nodes allow us to
build full meaning representations of entire sen-
tences in discourse. Therefore, while frame defi-
nitions are fixed, semantic nodes can be added dy-
namically during discourse understanding or gener-
ation to model the instances of frames that language
is evoking. We call such nodes temporary seman-
tic nodes. They they are closely related to the dis-
course referents of Discourse Representation Theory
(Kamp, 1981) and related concepts in other theories.
In contrast, persistent semantic nodes are used to
store world knowledge which is distinct from the
conceptual knowledge encoded within frames and
their relations; for example, the frame for moon will
not encode the fact that the moon?s circumference is
6,790 miles, but we may record that using a knowl-
edge based of external assertions semantic nodes are
given their meaning by corresponding frames (CIR-
CUMFERENCE, MILE, etc.). A temporary semantic
node can become persistent by being retained in the
knowledge base.
3.2 Vignette Types and their Decomposition
A vignette is a frame in the FrameNet sense that is
decomposed to a set of more primitive frames us-
ing the SUBFRAME-PARALLEL frame-to-frame re-
lation. The frame elements (FEs) of a vignette are
31
defined as in FrameNet, except that our grounding
in the graphical representation gives us a new, strong
criterion to choose what the FEs are: they are the ob-
jects necessarily involved in the visual scene associ-
ated with that vignette. The subframes represent the
spatial and other relations between the FEs. The re-
sulting semantic relations specify how the scene el-
ements are spatially arranged. This mechanism cov-
ers several different cases.
For actions, we conceptually freeze the action in
time, much as in a comic book panel, and repre-
sent it in a vignette with a set of objects, spatial
relations between those objects, and poses charac-
teristic for the humans (and other pliable beings) in-
volved in that action. Action vignettes will typically
be specialized to composed vignettes, so that the ap-
plicability of different vignettes with the same par-
ent frame will depend on the values of the FEs of
the parent. In the process of creating composed vi-
gnettes, FEs are often added because additional ob-
jects are required to play auxiliary roles. As a re-
sult, the FEs of an action vignette are the union of
the semantic roles of the important participants and
props involved in that enactment of the action with
the FEs of the parent frame. For instance the follow-
ing vignette describes one concrete way of washing
a small fruit. Note that we have included a new FE
sink which is not motivated in the frame WASH.2
Note also that this vignette also contains a selec-
tional restriction on its theme, which we will dis-
cuss in the next subsection and which is not shown
here.
WASH-SMALL-FRUIT(washer, theme, sink)
FRONTOF(figure:washer, figure:sink)
FACING(figure:washer, figure:sink)
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:theme)
REACH(reacher:washer, target:sink)
In this notation the head row contains the vignette
name and its FEs in parentheses. For readability we
will often omit FEs that are part of the vignette but
not restricted or used in any mentioned relation. The
lower box contains the vignette decomposition and
implicitly specifies SUBFRAME-PARALLEL frame-
to-frame relations. In the decomposition of a vi-
gnette V we use the notation F(a:b, ? ? ? ) to indicate
that the FE a of frame F is mapped to the FE b of V.
2FrameNet does not currently contain a WASH frame, but if
it did, it would not contain an FE sink.
When V is instantiated the semantic node binding to
a must also be able to bind to b in F.
Locations are represented by vignettes which ex-
press constraints between a set of objects character-
istic for the given location. The FEs of location vi-
gnettes include these constituent objects. For exam-
ple, one type of living room (of many possible ones)
might contain a couch, a coffee table, and a fireplace
in a certain arrangement.
LIVING-ROOM 42(left wall, far wall, couch,
coffee table, fireplace)
TOUCHING(figure:couch, ground:left wall)
FACING(figure:couch, ground:right wall)
FRONTOF(figure:coffee table, ground: sofa)
EMBEDDED(figure:fire-place, ground:far wall)
Even ordinary physical objects will have certain
characteristic parts with size, shape, and spatial re-
lations that can be expressed by vignettes. For ex-
ample, an object type such as a kind of stop sign can
be defined as a two-foot-wide, red, hexagonal metal
sheet displaying the word ?STOP? positioned on the
top of a 6 foot high post.
STOP-SIGN(sign-part, post-part, texture)
MATERIAL(theme:sign-part, material:METAL)
MATERIAL(theme:post-part, material:METAL)
DIAMETER(theme:sign-part, diameter:2 feet)
HEIGHT(theme:post-part, height:6 feet)
ONTOP(figure:sign-part, ground:post-part)
TEXTURE(theme:sign-part, texture:?STOP?)
In addition, many real-world objects do not corre-
spond to lexical items but are elaborations on them
or combinations. These sublexical entities can be
represented by vignettes as well. For example, one
such 3D object in our text-to-scene system is a goat
head mounted on a piece of wood. This object is
represented by a vignette with two FEs (ghead,
gwood) representing the goat?s head and the wood.
The vignette decomposes into ON(ghead, gwood).
While there can be many vignettes for a single
lexical item, representing the many ways a location,
action, or object can be constituted, vignettes need
not be specialized for every particular situation and
can be more or less general. In one exteme creat-
ing vignettes for every verb/argument combination
would clearly lead to a combinatorial explosion and
is not feasible. In the other extreme we can define
rather general vignettes. For example, a vignette
32
USE-TOOL for using a tool on a theme can be repre-
sented by the user GRASPING the tool and REACH-
ING towards the theme. These vignettes can be
used in decompositions of more concrete vignettes
(e.g. HAMMER-NAIL-INTO-WALL). They can also
be used directly if no other more concrete vignette
can be applied (because it does not exist or its selec-
tional restrictions cannot be satisfied). In this way
by defining a small set of such vignettes we can vi-
sualize approximate scenes for a large number of de-
scriptions.
3.3 Selectional Restrictions on Frame Elements
To define a frame we need to specify selectional re-
strictions on the semantic type of its FEs. Instead
of relying on a fixed inventory of semantic types,
we assert conceptual knowledge and external asser-
tions over persistent semantic types. This allows us
to use VigNet?s large set of frames to represent such
knowledge. For example, an apple can be defined as
a small round fruit.
APPLE(self)
SHAPEOF(figure:self, shape:spherical)
SIZEOF(figure:self, size:small)
APPLE is simply a frame that contains a self FE,
which allows us to make assertions about the con-
cept (i.e. about any semantic node bound to the
self FE). Frame elements of this type are not un-
usual in FrameNet, where they are mainly used for
frames containing common nouns (for instance the
Substance FE contains a substance FE). In Vi-
gNet we implicitly use self in all frames, including
frames describing situations and events.
We use the same mechanism to define specialized
compound vignettes such as WASH SMALL FRUIT.
We extend WASH in the following way to restrict
it to small fruits (we abreviate F(self:a) as a=F for
readability).
WASH-SMALL-FRUIT(washer, theme, sink)
% selectional restrictions
sink=SINK, washer=PERSON,
theme=x, x=FRUIT,
SIZEOF(figure:x,size:small)
% decomposition
FRONTOF(figure:washer, figure:sink)
FACING(figure:washer, figure:sink)
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:theme)
REACH(reacher:washer, target:sink)
4 Examples
In this section we give further examples of visual
action vignettes for the verb wash. The selectional
restrictions and graphical decomposition of these vi-
gnettes vary depending on the type of object be-
ing washed. The first example shows a vignette for
washing a vehicle.
WASH-VEHICLE(washer, theme, instr, location)
washer=PERSON, theme=VEHICLE,
instr=HOSE, location=DRIVEWAY
ONSURFACE(figure:theme, ground:location)
FRONTOF(figure:washer, ground:theme)
FACING(figure:washer, ground:theme)
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:instrument)
AIM(aimer:washer, theme:instr, target:theme)
The following two vignettes represent a case where
the object being washed alone does not determine
which vignette to apply. If the instrument is unspec-
ified one or the other could be used. We illustrate
one option in figure 1 (right).
WASH-FLOOR-W-SPONGE(washer,theme,instr)
washer=PERSON, theme=FLOOR,
instr=SPONGE
KNEELING(agent:washer),
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:instr),
REACH(reacher:washer, target:theme)
WASH-FLOOR-W-MOP(washer, theme, instr)
washer=PERSON, theme=FLOOR, instr=MOP
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:instr),
REACHWITH(reacher:washer, target:theme,
instr:instr)
It is easy to come up with other concrete vi-
gnettes for wash (washing windows, babies, hands,
dishes...). As mentioned in section 3.2 more gen-
eral vignettes can be defined for very broad object
classes. In choosing vignettes, the most specific will
be used (looking at type matching hierarchies), so
general vignettes will only be chosen when more
specific ones are unavailable. The following generic
vignette describes washing any large object.
WASH-LARGE-OBJECT(washer, theme instrument)
washer=PERSON, theme=OBJECT,
instrument=SPONGE,
SIZEOF(figure:theme, size:large)
FACING(figure:washer, ground:theme)
GRASP(grasper:washer, theme:instrument)
REACH(reacher:washer, target:theme)
33
In our final example, a vignette for picking fruit uses
the following assertion of world knowledge about
particular types of fruit and the trees they come
from:
SOURCE-OF(theme:x, source:y), APPLE(self:x),
APPLETREE(self:y)
In matching the vignette to the verb frame and its ar-
guments, the source frame element is bound to the
type of tree for the given theme (fruit).
PICK-FRUIT(picker, theme, source)
picker=PERSON, theme=FRUIT, source=TREE,
SOURCEOF(theme:theme, source:source)
UNDERCANOPY(figure:picker, canopy:source)
GRASP(grasper:picker, theme:theme)
REACH(reacher:picker, target:source.branch)
5 VigNet
We are developing VigNet as a general purpose re-
source, but with the specific goal of using it in text-
to-scene generation. In this section we first describe
various methods to populate VigNet. We then sketch
how we create graphical representations from Vi-
gNet meaning representations.
5.1 Populating VigNet
VigNet is being populated using several approaches:
? Amazon Mechanical Turk is being used to ac-
quire scene elements for location and action vi-
gnettes as well as the spatial relations among
those elements. For locations, Turkers are
shown representative pictures of different lo-
cations as well as variants of similar locations,
thereby providing distinct vignettes for each lo-
cation. We also use Mechanical Turk to acquire
general purpose relational information for ob-
jects and actions such as default locations, ma-
terials, contents, and parts.
? We extract relations such as typical locations
for actions from corpora based on co-occurance
patterns of location and action terms. This is
based on ideas described in (Sproat, 2001). We
also rely on corpora to induce new lexical units
and selectional preferences.
? A large set of semantic nodes and frames for
nouns has been imported from the noun lexicon
of the WordsEye text-to-scene system (Coyne
and Sproat, 2001). This lexicon currently con-
tains 15,000 lexical items and is tied to a li-
brary of 2,200 3D objects and 10,000 images
Semantic relations between these nodes include
parthood, containment, size, style (e.g. antique
or modern), overall shape, material, as well as
spatial tags denoting important spatial regions
on the object. We also import graphically-
oriented vignettes from WordsEye. These are
used to capture the meaning of sub-lexical 3D
objects such as the mounted goat head de-
scribed earlier.
? Finally, we intend to use WordsEye itself to al-
low users to visualize vignettes as they define
them, as a way to improve vignette accuracy
and relevancy to the actual use of the system.
While the population of VigNet is not the fo-
cus of this paper, it is our goal to create a usable
resource that can be populated with a reasonable
amount of effort. We note that opposed to resources
like FrameNet that require skilled lexicographers,
we only need simple visual annotation that can eas-
ily be done by untrained Mechanical Turkers. In
addition, as described in section 3.2, vignettes de-
fined at more abstract levels of the frame hierar-
chy can be used and composed to cover large num-
bers of frames in a plausible manner. This allows
more specific vignettes to be defined where the dif-
ferences are most significant. VigNet is is focused
on visually-oriented language involving tangible ob-
jects. However, abstract, process-oriented language
and relations such as negation can be depicted icon-
ically with general vignettes. Examples of these can
be seen in the figurative and metaphorical depictions
shown in (Coyne and Sproat, 2001).
5.2 Using VigNet in Text-to-Scene Generation
To compose a scene from text input such as the
man is washing the apple it is necessary to parse
the sentence into a semantic representation (evoking
frames for each content word) and to then resolve
the language-level semantics to a set of graphical
entities and relations. To create a low-level graph-
ical representation all frame elements need to be
filled with appropriate semantic nodes. Frames sup-
port the selection of these nodes by specifying con-
straints on them using selectional restrictions. The
34
SUBFRAME-PARALLEL decomposition of vignettes
then ultimately relates these nodes using elementary
spatial vignettes (FRONTOF, ON, ...).
Note that it is possible to describe scenes directly
using these vignettes (such as The man is in front of
the sink. He is holding an apple.), as was used to
create the mock-ups in figure 1.
Vignettes can be directly applied or composed to-
gether. Composing vignettes involves unifying their
frame elements. For example, in washing an ap-
ple, the WASH-SMALL-FRUIT vignette uses a sink.
From world knowledge we know (via instances of
the TYPICAL-LOCATION frame) that washing food
typically takes place in the KITCHEN. To create a
scene we compose the two vignettes together by uni-
fying the sink in the location vignette with the sink
in the action vignette.
6 Related Work
The grounding of natural language to graphical re-
lations has been investigated in very early text-to-
scene systems (Boberg, 1972), (Simmons, 1975),
(Kahn, 1979), (Adorni et al, 1984), and then later
in Put (Clay and Wilhelms, 1996), and WordsEye
(Coyne and Sproat, 2001). Other systems, such as
CarSim (Dupuy et al, 2001), Jack (Badler et al,
1998), and CONFUCIUS (Ma and McKevitt, 2006)
target animation and virtual environments rather
than scene construction. A graphically grounded
lexical-semantic resource such as VigNet would be
of use to these and related domains. The concept of
vignettes as graphical realizations of more general
frames was introduced in (Coyne et al, 2010).
In addition to FrameNet, much work has been
done in developing theories and resources for lexi-
cal semantics and common-sense knowledge. Verb-
Net (Kipper et al, 2000) focuses on verb subcat pat-
terns grouped by Levin verb classes (Levin, 1993),
but also grounds verb semantics into a small num-
ber of causal primitives representing temporal con-
straints tied to causality and state changes. VerbNet
lacks the ability to compose semantic constraints
or use arbitrary semantic relations in those con-
straints. Conceptual Dependency theory (Schank
and Abelson, 1977) specifies a small number of
state-change primitives into which all verbs are re-
duced. Event Logic (Siskind, 1995) decomposes ac-
tions into intervals describing state changes and al-
lows visual grounding by specifying truth conditions
for a small set of spatial primitives (a similar for-
malism is used by Ma and McKevitt (2006)). (Bai-
ley et al, 1998) and related work proposes a rep-
resentation in many ways similar to ours, in which
lexical items are paired with a detailed specifica-
tion of actions in terms of elementary body poses
and movements. In contrast to these temporally-
oriented approaches, VigNet grounds semantics in
spatial constraints active at a single moment in time.
This allows for and emphasizes contextual reason-
ing rather than causal reasoning. In addition, VigNet
emphasizes a holistic frame semantic perspective,
rather than emphasizing decomposition alone. Sev-
eral resources for common-sense knowledge exist or
have been proposed. In OpenMind and ConceptNet
(Havasi et al, 2007) online crowd-sourcing is used
to collect a large set of common-sense assertions.
These assertions are normalized into a set of a cou-
ple dozen relations. The Cyc project is using the web
to augment its large ontology and knowledge base of
common sense knowledge (Matuszek et al, 2005).
PRAXICON (Pastra, 2008) is a grounded concep-
tual resources that integrates motor-sensoric, visual,
pragmatic and lexical knowledge (via WordNet). It
targets the embodied robotics community and does
not directly focus on scene generation. It also fo-
cuses on individual lexical items, while VigNet, like
FrameNet, takes syntactic context into account.
7 Conclusion
We have described a new semantic paradigm that we
call vignette semantics. Vignettes are extensions of
FrameNet frames and represent the specific ways in
which semantic frames can be realized in the world.
Mapping frames to vignettes involves translating be-
tween high-level frame semantics and the lower-
level relations used to compose a scene. Knowledge
about objects, both in terms of their semantic types
and the affordances they provide is used to make that
translation. FrameNet frames, coupled with seman-
tic nodes representing entity classes, provide a pow-
erful relational framework to express such knowl-
edge. We are developing a new resource VigNet
which will implement this framework and be used
in our text-to-scene generation system.
