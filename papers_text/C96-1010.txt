Abstract 
Parsing spontaneous speech is a difficult task 
because of the ungrammatical nature of most 
spoken utterances. To overpass this problem, we 
propose in this paper to handle the spoken 
language without considering syntax. We 
describe thus a microsemantic parser which is 
uniquely based on an associative network of 
semantic priming. Experimental results on 
spontaneous speech show that this parser stands 
for a robust alternative to standard ones. 
i. Introduction 
The need of a robust parsing of spontaneous 
speech is a more and more essential as spoken 
human - machine communication meets a really 
impressive development. Now, the extreme 
structural variability of the spoken language 
balks seriously the attainment of such an 
objective. Because of its dynamic and 
uncontrolled nature, spontaneous speech 
presents indeed a high rate of ungrammatical 
constructions (hesitations, repetitious, a.s.o...). 
As a result, spontaneous speech catch rapidly out 
most syntactic parsers, in spite of the frequent 
addition of some ad hoc corrective methods 
\[Seneff 92\]. Most speech systems exclude 
therefore a complete syntactic parsing of the 
sentence. They on the contrary restrict the 
analysis to a simple keywords extraction \[Appelt 
92\]. This selective approach led to significant 
results in some restricted applications (ATIS...). 
It seems however unlikely that it is appropriate 
for higher level tasks, which involve a more 
complex communication between the user and 
the computer. 
Thus, neither the syntactic methods nor the 
selective approaches can fully satisfy the 
constraints of robustness and of exhaustivity 
spoken human-machine communication eeds. 
This paper presents a detailed semantic parser 
which masters most spoken utterances. In a first 
part, we describe the semantic knowledge our 
parser relies on. We then detail its 
implementation. Experimental results, which 
suggest he suitability of this model, are finally 
provided. 
2. Microsemantics 
Most syntactic formalisms (LFG \[Bresnan 82\], 
HPSG \]Pollard 87\], TAG \[Joshi 87\]) give a 
major importance to subcategorization, which 
accounts for the grammatical dependencies 
inside the sentence. We consider on the contrary 
that subcategorization issue from a lexical 
semantic knowledge we will further name 
microsemantics \[Rastier 94\].

Our parser aims thus at building a microsemantic 
structure (figure 1) which fully describes the 
meaning dependencies inside the sentence. The 
corresponding relations are labeled by several 
microsemantic cases (Table 1) which only intend 
to cover the system's application field 
(computer-helped drawing). 
The microsemantic parser achieves a fully 
lexicalized analysis. It relies indeed on a 
microsemantic lexicon in which every input 
represents a peculiar lexeme I. Each lexeme is 
described by the following features tructure : 
PRED lexeme identifier 
MORPI1 morphological realizations 
SEM semantic domain 
SUBCAT subcategorization frame 
I Lexeme = lexical unit of meaning.

I AGT = / e lement / + / animate /
Subcat = /oBJ = / element / + / concrete / 
\[( LOC)  = / property / + / place 
Sere = / task - domain /
The microsemantic subcategorization frames 
describe the meaning dependencies the lexeme 
dominate. Their arguments are not ordered. The 
optional arguments are in brackets, by 
opposition with the compulsory ones. At last, the 
adverbial phrases are not subcategorized.

3.  Semant ic  P r iming  
Any speech recognition system involves a high 
perplexity which requires the definition of top- 
down parsing constraints. This is why we based 
the microsemantic parsing on a priming process. 
3.1. Priming process 
The semantic priming is a predictive process 
where some already uttered words (priming 
words) are calling some other ones (primed 
words) through various meaning associations. It 
aims a double goal : 
? It constrains the speech recognition. 
? It characterizes the meaning dependencies 
inside the sentence. 
Each priming step involves two successive 
processes. At first, the contextual adaptation 
favors the priming words which are consistent 
with the semantic context. The latter is roughly 
modeled by two semantic fields: the task domain 
and the computing domain. On the other hand, 
the relational priming identifies the lexemes 
which share a microsemantic relation with one 
of the already uttered words. These relations 
issue directly from the subcategorization frames 
of these priming words. 
3.2. Priming network 
The priming process is carried out by an 
associative multi-layered network (figure 2) 
which results from the compilation of the 
lexicon. Each cell of the network corresponds to 
a specific lexeme. The inputs represent the 
priming words. Their activities are propagated 
up to the output layer which corresponds to the 
primed words. An additional layer (Structural 
layer S) handles furthermore the coordinations 
and the prepositions. 
We will now describe the propagation of the 
priming activities. Let us consider : 
? t current step of analysis 
? a;/(t) activity of the cell j of the layer i at 
stept (i e {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, S} ) 
? ~J(t) synaptic weight between the cell k of 
the layer i and the cell I of the layer j. 
Tempora l  forgett ing - -  At first, the input 
activities are slightly modulated by a process of 
temporal forgetting :
ail(t) =amax if i is to the current word. 
ail(t) = amax if i is to the primer of thisword. 
a~l(t) = Max (0, ail(t- 1)- Afo, g~t ) otherwise. 
Although it favors the most recent lexemes, this 
process does not prevent long distance primings. 
Contextual adaptat ion - -  Each cell of the 
second layer represents a peculiar semantic field. 
Its activity depends on the semantic affiliations 
of the priming words : 
a~ (t)= Eoli,:~(t).air (t) (1) 
i 
C0il',~(t) = COma x if i belongs to j. with: 
c01j:~(t) = -Olma x otherwise. 
Then, these contextual cells modulate the initial 
priming activities :
( t )= ai i (t) + y__. i i i m2,3(t) .a 2 (t) 
i 
with: coi2'i (t) = Aoo,~,ex, if j belongs to i. 
coi2'i (t) = - Aco,,ext otherwise. 
The priming words which are consistent with the 
current semantic ontext are therefore favored. 
48 
Re la t iona l  P r iming  - -  The priming activities 
are then dispatched mnong several sub-networks 
which perform parallel analyses on distinct cases 
(fig. 3). The dispatched activities represents 
therefore the priming power of the priming 
lexemes o51 each microselnantic case : 
? ' (t)= y o+~:+(t) <(t) " ( t ) . ; ( t )  d4t  z , = (0:L+ t . 
J 
The dispatching weights are dynamically 
adapted uring the parsing (see section 4)+ Their 
initial values issue front the compilation ol the 
lexical subcategorization flames :
ml4~J,,5,(t) : C?min otherwise. 
The outputs of the case-based sub-networks, as 
well as the final priming excitations, are then 
calculated through a maximum heuristic :
a{,,Ct) = Max ( i,j ro .... (t). a{.(t ) )  (4) 
(3) i 
a>) : (+,',<t)) 
The lexical units are t'inally sorted in three 
coarse sets :

primable words 
rejected words 
The primed words aims at constraining the 
speech recognition, thereby warranting the 
semantic coherence of the analysis. These 
constraints can be relaxed by considering the 
primable words. Every recognized word is 
finally handled by the parsing process with its 
priming relation (see section 4). 
3.3. P repos i t ions  
Prepositions restrict the microsemantic 
assignment of lhe objects they introduce. As a 
resttlt, the in'epositional cells of the st ructura l  
layer tnodulate dynamically the case-based 
49 
dispatching weights to prohibit any inconsistent 
priming. The rule (3') stands therefore for (3) : 
i i,i (~ .a~(t) ) ai3(t) a4c ~ (t) = O3,4c~(t ) . ?Ok~x(t) 
with: c0k(t) = ~0ma x if ~ is consistent with the 
preposition k. 
?ok(t) = 0 otherwise. 
and ? ask(t) = area x while the object of k is 
not assigned a case. 
ak(t) = 0 otherwise. 
At last, the preposition is assigned the TAG 
argument of the introduced object. 
3.4. Coordinations 
The parser deals only for the moment being with 
logical coordinations (and, or, but...). In such 
cases, the coordinated elements must share the 
same microsemantic ase. This constraint is 
worked out by the recall of the already fulfilled 
microsemantic relations, which were all 
previously stacked. The dispatching is thus 
restricted to the recalled relations every time a 
coordination occurs :
i,j i,j m3.4~(t) = m3.4~(0) for a stacked relation 
i,j 033,4, ~(t) = 0 otherwise. 
The coordinate words are finally considered the 
coo arguments of the conjunction, which is 
assigned to the shared microsemantic case. 
3,5. Back priming 
Generally speaking, the priming process 
provides a set of words that should follow the 
already uttered lexemes. In some cases, a lexeme 
might however occur before its priming word : 
(a) I want  to enlarge the smal l  w indow 
Back priming situations are handled through the 
following algorithm : 
Evm~? time a new word occurs :
1. If this word was not primed, it is pushed 
it in a back priming stack. 
2. Otherwise, one checks whether this word 
back primes some stacked ones. Back 
primed words are then popped out. 
4. Microsemantic parsing 
4.1. Unification 
The microsemantic parsing relies on the 
unification of the subcategorization frames of 
the lexemes that are progressively recognized. 
This unification must respect four principles : 
Unicity - -  Any argume~B'~nust be at the most 
fulfilled by a unique lexeme or a coordination. 
Coherence-  Any lexeme must fulfil at the 
most a unique argument. 
Coordinat ion - -  Coordinate lexemes must 
fulfil the same subcategorized argument. 
Relative completeness - -  Any argument 
might remain unfulfilled although the parser 
must always favor the more complete analysis. 
The principle of relative completeness is 
motivated by the high frequency of incomplete 
utterances (ellipses, interruptions...) spontaneous 
speech involves. The parser aims only at 
extracting an unfinished microsemantic structure 
pragmatics hould then complete. As noticed 
previously with the coordinations, these 
principles govern preventively the contextual 
adaptation of the network weights, so that any 
incoherent priming is excluded. 
5. LINGUISTIC ABILITIES 
As illustrated by the previous example, the 
microsemantic parser masters rather complex 
sentences. The study of its linguistic abilities 
offers a persuasive view of its structural power. 
5.1. Linguistic coverage 
Although our parser is dedicated to French 
applications, we expect our semantic approach 
to be easily extended to other languages. We will 
now study several linguistic phenomena the 
parser masters easily. 
Compound tenses and passive - -  According to 
the microsemantic point of view, the auxiliaries 
appear as a mark of modality of the verb. As a 
result, the parser considers ordinarily any 
auxiliary an ordinary MOD argument of the verb. 
(d) J 'ai mangd \[Pred =' manger' " 
*I has eaten. \ [MOD = \[Pred ='avoir'\] 
I ate. LAGT = \[Pred =' je'\] 
(e) Le carrd est effacd " \[Pred ='carr6' \] 
The square is erased OBJ = \[DET = \[Pred ='le'\]J 
Pred ='effacer' 
MOD = \[Pred ='e te~\] 
~Pred --'logidel,' , 
AGT =/DET = \[Pred = le \] 
LTAG =' par' 
50 
I n te r rogat ions -  Three interrogative forms are 
met in French : subject inversion (fl), est-ce-que 
questions (f2) and intonative questions (f3). 
(fl) ddpla~'ons nous le carrd ? 
(f2) est-ce-que nous ddplafons le carrd ? 
(f3) nous dgplacfons le carrd ? 
Since the parser ignores most word-order 
considerations, the interrogative utterances are 
processed like any declarative ones. This 
approach suits perfectly to spontaneous speech, 
which rarely involves a subject inversion. Closed 
questions are consequently characterized either 
by a prosodic analysis or by the adverbial phrase 
est-ce-que. 
(g) oft ddplafons nous le carrd ? 
Open questions (g) are on the contrary 
introduced explicitly by an interrogative pronoun 
which stands for the missing argument. 
Relat ive c lauses - - -Every  relative clause is 
considered an argtunent of the lexeme the 
relative pronoun refers to. 
(h) It encumbers  the window which is here 
The microsemantic structures of the main and 
the relative clauses are however kept distinct to 
respect the principle of coherence. The two 
parse trees are indirectly related by an anaphoric 
a~lation (REF). 
Subord inate  c lauses -  Provided the dependent 
clause is not a relative one, the subordinate verb 
is subcategorized by the main one. 
(i) Draw a circle as soon as the square is erased 
As a result, subordinate clauses are parsed like 
any ordinary object. 
5.2. Spontaneous constructions 
The suitability of the semantic parser is rcally 
patent when considering spontaneous peech. 
The parser masters indeed most of the 
spontaneous ungrammatical constructions 
without any specific mechanism : 
Repet i t ions and  self -correct ions - -  Repetitions 
and self-corrections seem to violate the principle 
of unicity. They involve indeed sevcral lexemes 
which share the same lnicroselnantic case : 
(1l) *Select he device ... the right (_tevice. 
(12) *Close the display ~ ... the window. 
These constructions are actually considered a 
peculiar coordination where the conjunction is 
missing \[De Smedt 87\]. Then, they are parsed 
like any coordination? 
Ell ipses and  interrupt ions - -  The principle of 
relative completeness is mainly designed for the 
ellipses and the interruptions, Our parser is thus 
able to extract alone the incomplete structure of 
any interrupted utterance. On the contrary, the 
criterion of relative completeness is deficient for 
most of the ellipses like (t), where the upper 
predicate to move is omitted :
(n) * \[Movc l The left door on the right too. 
Such wide ellipses should nevertheless be 
recovered at a upper pragmatic level. 
Comments  - -Genera l ly  speaking, comments do 
not share any microsemantic relation with the 
sentence they are inserted in : 
(o) * Draw a line ... that's it ... on the right.. 
For instance, the idiomatic phrase that's it is 
related to (o) at the pragmatic level and not at 
the semantic one. As a result, the microsemantic 
parser can not unify the main clause and the 
comment. We expect however filrther studies on 
pragmatic marks to enhance the parsing of these 
constructions. Despite this weakness, the 
robustness of the microsemantic parser is 
already substantial. The following experimental 
results will thus suggest he suitability of our 
mnodcl for spontaneous speech parsing. 
6. Results 
This section presents several experiments that 
were carr ied out on our microsemantic analyzer 
as well as on a LFG parser \[Zweigenbaum 91\]. 
These experiments were achieved on the literal 
written transcription of three corpora of 
spontaneous speech (table 2) which all 
correspond to a collaborative task of drawing 
between two human subjects (wizard of Oz 
experiment).

The dialogues were totally unconstrained, so that 
the corpora are corresponding to natural

spontaneous peech. We compared the two 
parser according on their robustness and their 
perplexity. 
6.1. Robustness 
The table 3 provides the accuracy rates of the 
two parsers. These results show the benefits of 
our approach. Around four utterances over five 
(-?=83.5%) are indeed processed correctly by 
the microsemantic parser whereas the LFG's 
accuracy is limited to 40% on the two first 
corpora. Its robustness is noticeably higher on 
the third corpus, which presents a moderate ratio 
of ungrammatical utterances. The overall 
performances of the LFG suggest nevertheless 
that a syntactic approach is not suitable for 
spontaneous peech, by opposition with the 
microsemantic one.

Semantics 0.853 0.785 0.866 0.835 0.036 
Besides, the independence of microsemantics 
from the grammatical shape of the utterances 
warrants its robustness remains relatively 
unaltered (standard eviation CYn = 0.036). 
6.2. Perplexity 
As mentioned above, the microsemantic parser 
ignores in a large extent most of the constraints 
of linear precedence. This tolerant approach is 
motivated by the frequent ordering violations 
spontaneous speech involves. It however leads to 
a noticeable increase of perplexity. This 
deterioration is particularly patent for sentences 
which include at least eight lexemes (Table 4).

At first, we proposed to reduce this perplexity 
through a cooperation between the 
microsemantic analyzer and a LFG parser 
\[Antoine 9411. Although this cooperation 
achieves a noticeable reduction of the perplexity, 
it is however ineffective when the LFG parser 
collapses. This is why we intend at present o 
inserl, directly some ordering constraints 
spontaneous peech never violates. \[Rainbow 
9411 established that any ordering rule should be 
expressed lexically. We suggest consequently to
order partially the arguments of every lexical 
subcategorization. Thus, each frame will be 
assigned few equations which will characterize 
some ordering priorities among its arguments. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we argued the structural variability 
of spontaneous speech prevents its parsing by 
standard syntactic analyzers. We have then 
described a semantic analyzer, based on an 
associative priming network, which aims at 
parsing spontaneous speech without considering 
syntax. The linguistic coverage of this parser, as 
well as several its robustness, have clearly 
shown the benefits of this approach. We expect 
furthermore the insertion of word-order 
constraints to noticeably decrease the perplexity 
of the microsemantic analyzer.
