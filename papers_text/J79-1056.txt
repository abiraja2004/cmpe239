recent  p o s i t i o n  of Charniak t h a t  A r t i f i c i a l  I n t e l l i g e n c e  ( A I )  n a t u r a l  
language systems do n o t  i n  f a c t  make any use d case, I s h a l l  d l scuss  
h i s  arguments and urge t h a t ,  although t h e r e  a r e  systems to  whlch h i s  
arguments do apply, they do not  apply to  the  one described here ,  a t  l e a s t  
ho t  i f  case  i s  t o  have a n y t h ~ n g  l i k e  i t s  normal meaning, 
The use  of case i n f o r m a t ~ o n  i n  A 1  comes from the  work of F ~ l l m o r e  
(1968), i n  which the  underlying s t ructur ,e  of a  sentence i s  displayed,  
i n  essence,  a s  an a r ray  of argument values far a p red ica te ,  where the  
-redi,:ate i s  t h e  verb of  tk sentenceo The corresponding values a r e  
the case  p a r t s  of the  sentence,  each of a d i f f e r e n t  case type, and, 
f o r  any given verb, the  general  p a t t e r n  of  cases  i t  takes  is c a l l e d  
t h e  case  frame of t h a t  verb. 
Thus, i f  t he  h o r i z o n t a l  l i n e s  denote the  verb p r e d i c a t e ,  the  case 
frame f o r  "break" could be  w r i t t e n  as: 
( - - -- - - - OBJECT (AGENT) (INSTRLJIENT) ) 
which means t h a t  t h i s  verb must  t ake  an o b j e c t ,  and cen b u t  need no t  
t ake  an agent and inst rument  case. These l a t t e r  two cases  a r e  option- 
a l  h e r e  and t h a t  o p t i o n a l l t y  i s  indicated by t h e  parentheses  round the 
-
case  names. So, on t h i s  view: 
(1) John b r o k e  
would be i l l-formed because  i t  gives us on ly  t h e  (opt iona l )  agent of 
breaking,  which i s  John, b u t  omits the  o b l i g a t o r y  o b j e c t  t h a t  i s  broken. 
Thls a n a l y s i s  can be c o n t r a s t e d  with  "h i t " ,  whose frame would be 
( - - - - - - - OBJECT (AGENT 1 INSTRUMENT) ) 
where the  over lapping b racke t s  mean that t h e  two cases ,agent  and 
ins t rumenta l  a r e  semi-optional ,  i n  t h a t  a t  l e a s t  one of the  two must 
appear. Thus 
The window h i t  
would be  i l l-formed on t h a t  view because, a l though i t  con ta ins  t h e  
o b l i g a t o r y  o b j e c t ,  i t  con ta ins  n e i t h e r  t h e  agent  nor the ins t rument  
of t h e  h i t t i n g ,  However, 
(3) The window broke 
would be  p e r f e c t l y  well-formed w i t h  r e s p e c t  t o  t h e  frame f o r  'b reak ' ,

A l l  are pe r f ec t ly  well-formed with respect  t o  the  franc f o r  "break1' 
given earlier.  Simmons pa r ses  such  sentences u s i n g  an augmented trans- 
i t i o n  network (Woodst1970) and a not ion of case paradigm due  t o  Celce- 
Murcia (1972).  This paradigm, f o r  a c t i v e  fo rms of a verb l l k e  "break", 
has the form: 
(8) AGENT * OBJECT INSTRUMENT 
AGENI * CBJECT 
INSTRUMEIJT * OBJECT 
OBJECT A 
The l i n e s  of (8) a r e  p a t t e r n s  t h a t  must match input  word s t r i n g s  
i n  l e f t  r i g h t  o r d e r  so a s  t o  a s s i g n  the cases  they contain,  The l i n e s  
of (8) match each of (4) - (7) i n  tu rn ,  where marks the  p o s l t i o n  of 
t h e  verb (break) i n  each l i n e  of t h e  paradigm, The l i n e s  of (8) a re  
no more than t h e  poss ib le  case combinations a l lowed  by the case frame 
11 f o r  "break" t o g e t h e r  with an a n a l y t i c  ve r s ion  of the  sub jec t  s e l e c t i o n  
rule" ,  which a l w a y s  makes the Agent t h e  f i r s t  ( sub jec t )  i t e m  I n  any 
l i n e  of t h e  paradigm (8) i n  which i t  occurs, There i s  no need f o r  t h e  
l i n e s  of (8) t o  be ordered In t h e i r  a p p l i c a t i o n  t o  inpu t  sentences ,  
although there  i s  one additional. item of information required before 
they can be applied a t  a l l :  the se lec t ion  r e s t r i c t i o n s ,  These t e l l  
us what i t  i s  to  be  an agent of "break": i n  Simons 's  scheme a  noun 
marked ANIMATE, The se lec t ion  r e s t r i c t i o n s  attached t o  the  cases i n  
(8) a r e  e s sen t i a l  t~ the appl icat ion of the paradlgrn, f o r  only thus 
could w e  know tha t  "~ohn"  i n  (4)  was matched by ACZENT i n  the f l r s t  
l i n e  of (8). It should be noted tha t  the  r e s t r i c t i o n  of AGENT i n  (8) 
to  nouns m%rked ANIMATE i s  not necessar i ly  a r e s t r i c t i o n  peculiar  t o  
'break' ,  but  ra ther  to the c lass  of verbs fo r  which (8) i s  t h e  (act ive)  
paradigm. Conversely, the ANIMATE r e s t r i c t i o n  on AGEPU'Ts i n  (8) IS 
not necessar i ly  on AGENTS a s  such although i t  might turn out  to be so, 
These points  w i l l  be important when we come to  Chamiak's arguments 
l a t e r .  
Notice t o o ,  tha t  there  a r e  not  two d i f f e ren t  ways I n  which a 
sentence can be ill-formed with respect  to the paradigm: one with 
respect  to  se lec t ion  r e s t r i c t i o n s  and one with respect  t o  the case 
frame (as has been argued by Bruce 1975). The case frame expressed 
by the  paradigm, and the corresponding select ion r e s t r i c t i o n s  are 
ind iv is ib le .  So, for example, 
(9) John broke 
i s  ill-formed with respect  to the case frame f o r  "break" a s  explained 
e a r l i e r ,  However, i f  w e  look a t  t h a t  f a c t  i n  procedural /terms, such 
as t h o s e  provided by Simmons' paradigm, we  cannot  deem t h a t  f a i l u r e  a s  
one of matching a  l i n e  of  (8) a s  d i s t i n c t  from (Bruce's  view)  n o t  
meeting t h e  s e l e c t ~ o n  r e s t r ~ c t i o n s  PHYSOB , say, on t h e  c a s e  OBJECT 
on t h e  f o u r t h  l i n e  of (8). For t h e  s e l e c t i o n  r e s t r i c t i o n  a s s o c i a t e d  
w i t h  a  case  d e f i n e s  what ~t i s  t o  match a corresponding l i n e  of  (8). 
The on ly  way i n  which a sentence could independent ly  f a l l  t o  match any 
l i n e  i n  t h e  paradigm of (8) would be  t h e  t r i v i a l  one of having  some 
number of  arguments (say,  f o u r  o r  zero)  n o t  corresponding t o  any l i n e  
of (8),

s t r i k e  'hammer 
The representations described here  a r e  n o t  of t h i s  s u p e r f i c i a l  form 
f o r  three  reasons:  
a) Semantic n e t s  do not  immediately suggest t h e i r  associa ted  
processes,  whereas the  represen ta t ions  he re  a r e  intended t o  be 
d i r ec t ed  towards the  processes t h a t  opera te  on them. 
b) There i s  a c lear  d i s t i n c t i o n  i n  the  present  system of represent- 
1 2  
a t i o n  between the knowledge s tored  and the  pa t t e rns  sought i n  language, 
on t h e  one hand, and the  language t e x t  ac tua l ly  represented found, on 
the  o ther ;  where the l a t t e r  may not  exact ly  match what was being looked 
fo r ,  This d i s t i n c t i o n  1s  not always easy to  work i n t o  a semantic n e t  
s t ruc tu re .  
c) The present  system of representa t ion  i s  intended to  be more 
"habitable" i n  Watt 's  (1968) sense of  providing a language of semantic 
represen ta t ion  t h a t  i s  appropr ia te  t o  the way humans express themselves. 
That i s  a highly sub jec t ive  not ion,  perhaps, but  here  i t  i s  taken to 
require  a t  l e a s t  a  dynamrc, o r  readable s t r u c t u r e ,  which n e t s  do not  
haverThj srequirement r e s t s  upon another assuniption: t h a t  our 
representa t ion  must have the  "one th ing  a f t e r  another" f ea tu re  t h a t  
text ,$  have, r a the r  than being s t a t i c  and t imeless  l i k e  most semantic 
nets  (thoughdNorman and Rumelhart  (1975) hdve constructed ne t s  
containing ordered asse r t ions ,  though these  a r e  no longer semantic 
n e t s  i n  the  c l a s s i c  sense).  
The case pr imi t ives  funct ion within a semantic dependency 
grammar (Hays ? 9 6 4 ) ,  intended t o  express the  meaning of word senses 
and, by extension, of texts .  Each of the casg pr imi t ives  above w i l l  
have a dependent, which i s  a type of e n t i t y  f o r  a l l  the  case prirfi- 
i t i v e s  except WAY and GOAL, which take an a s se r t i on  as  dependent, 
The case pr imi t ive  and i t s  dependent ( e n t i t y  o r  a s se r t i on )  f o m  a 
case  group which i s  i n  turn  dependent on a p r imi t ive  ac t ion  (except 
f o r  WITH and POSS which depended on an e n t i t y  , and may t h e r e f o r e  
.be only  semi-cases).  This is best seen by example of t h e  first 
s t r u c t u r e  i n  the system, t h e  formula -which expresses  word s e n s e  i n  
the d i c t i o n a r y ,  The formula f o r  t h e  action sense of "break" i s  as 
fo l lows:  
The g e n e r a l  structure of such formulas h a s  been expla ined  In 
Wifks (1968, 1972, 1975a, 1975b). They are in tended t o  express the  
f n t e r l i n g u a l  meaning of t h e  sense of the  word, and t h e  p r i m i t i v e s  t h a t  
comprise them are in tehded t o  be i n t e r l i n g u a l  (as a r e  F i l l m o r e ' s  cases )  
even though they happen t o  be mostly Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.  
'E'ormulas are t r e e s  of l e f t - r i g n t  dependencies b u t  t h e  dependence i s  
i n t e r p r e t e d  d i f f e r e n t l y  acccrding t o  t h e  type of t h e  subformula. 
We have already mentioned the  dependence of  an e n t i t y  (or  a s s e r t i o n )  
on a case p r i m r t i v e  t o  form a case  group, such a s  (*'tIb% SUBJ), which 
means t h a t  an agent i s  (preferably)  human. These case  groups (except 
WITH and POSS) a11 depend r ightwards on some a c t i o n ,  so t ha t  (*HUM S U N )  
i n  (10) depends on t h e  main p r i m i t i v e  a c t i o h  of t h e  whole formula STRTK, 
The whole formula i s  to be  i n t e r p r e t e d  a s  "breaking" being a ~ ' k ~ ~ ~ i n g ,

t h e  dependents of t h e  p r imi t ives ,  as i n ,  say Schank (1973), 
I n  t h p  p resen t  system, such a  r e s t r i c t i o n  could emerge only 
induc t ive ly  from a  survey of a cons iderable  body of formulas, It i s  
worth c l a r i f y i n g  t h i s  i s s u e  here: what do underlying rep resen ta t ions  
c o n s t i t u t e  case frames f o r ?  The i s s u e  i s  r e l a t e d  to  two o t h e r s :  
-
f i r s t  , the  d i f f e r e n t  r o l e s  of case  frames i n  ana lys i s  and gen*ratian, 
and secot~dfy,  the  procedural opposi t ion between case frame b luep r in t s ,  
l i k e  formulas3 and the ' fu l ler* '  r epresen ta t ions  o f  genera t ive  sunantic- 
> i s t s  t r e e s  and Schankian ~ c o n c e p t u a ~ i z a t i o n s ' .  
First , l e t  u s  note  t h a t  i t  has neyer been as c l e a r  as mrght be  
wished what case  frames awe f o r  i n  Fi l lmore ' s  work, The normal i n t r o -  
ductory account given ea r l i e r  s t a t e s  t h a t  they a r e  f o r  surface  verbs  
l i k e  ' b reak ' ,  but i n  Fi l lmore (1975) he argues t h a t  i t  i s  not so simple 
because he  would want t o  admit sentences like: 
(12) Noon found Harry sleeping 
as p e r f e c t l y  well-formed, while no t  taking account of  the  usgge i n  t he  
%ent ive  p a r t  of t h e  case frame f o r  ' f ind ' .  On the  o the r  hand, he 
wishes t o  avoid the  pos i t ion  of saying t h a t  case frames are  f o r  under- 
ly ing  verbs  l i k e  semantic primitives i n  formulas, o r  t he  underlying 
verbs of Generative Semanti~srepresentations which avoid cases a l t o -  
ge ther ,  a s  i n  t he  following f o r  "I broke the g l a s s  with a rock". 
I have followed Fil lmore 's  (1975j device here  of making (13) 
easier to  read by put t ing  ~t i n  SVO rather than t h e  usual  VSO 
(predicate  f i r s t )  form, It w i l l  be seen t h a t  i t  i s  p r e t t y  s imi la r  
to t h e  above f n m u l a  for "break1' except t ha t ,  i n  o rde r  to avoid case 
notat ion,  they have had t o  r e s o r t  t o  such phi losophical ly  suspect  
devices as separa t ing  t h e  ac t  of using from t h e  bas ic  ' ac t '  i n s i d e  
the tree, even though there was r e a l l y  on ly  one ac t ion  in  the  whole 
business 
An extreme vers ion  of t h e  view t h a t  case frames belong only  t o  
the underlying s t ruc ture  i s  Schank's (1973) view tha t  case frames awe 
f o r  underlying pr imi t ive  ac t s  and t h a t  all cases that a p r imi t ive  ac t  
takes, i t  takes  ob l iga to r i ly .  
Thus, f o r  example, Schank's pr imi t ive  a c t  TRANS expresses the  
under ly ing  content  of such a c t i o n s  as "buy", " s e l l "  and "take", and .ke 
would beg in  t h e  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  of

b u t  f o r  t h e s e  p r i m i t i v e  a c t s ,  of  which he  has  about twelve. 
From the p o i n t  of view on c a s e  expressed i n  t h e  system desc r ibed  
here, b o t h  t h e s e  s t r o n g  p o s i t i o n s  have drawbacks, indeed they  have 
complementary ones,  In . t h e  f i r s t  p l a c e ,   illm more's (1968) system, 
wi th  the  a i d  of which he wants t o  c o n t r a s t  v e r b s  by means of t h e i r  
frames, only  becomes s i g n i f i c a n t  i f  I n t e r p r e t e d  wi th  t h e  a i d  of some 
non-surface ' representa t ion  of a c t i o n s .  So, f o r  example, Charniak has  
pointed o u t  (personal  communication) t h a t  t h e  e a r l i e r  c o n t r a s t  of t h e  
frames f o r  "h i t "  and "break" i s  s i g n i f i c a n t  only  i f  t h e r e  i s  Pome 
common, under ly ing ,  a c t i o n  t h a t  t h e  two v e r b s  sha re ,  and which can b e  
thought of as being s u b s t i t u t e d  f o r  t h e  h o r i z o n t a l  l i n e  i n  t h e  frames. 
Eor, i f  t h a t  i s  no& s o ,  theq the  con t ras t  of the  frames f o r  "kT11" and 
11 murder" i s  of no more i nke re s t  than the  c o n t r a s t  between " k i l l "  and 
I I remember", o r  any other  random verb,  I n  o ther  words, i t  i s  only 
because the  two v t r b s  plready' have something i n  common, over and above 
t h e i r  case frames, t h a t  the  comparison has point .  Thus, t he  con t r a s t  
of the  case  frames of only su r f ace  verbs i s ,  if  unsupplemented, un- 
s a t i s f a c t o r y ,  
Conversely, t h e r e  may be c e r t a i n  problems inherent  I n  Schank's 
attempt t o  both (a) r e l a t e  sur face  verbs t o  underlying p r imi t i ve  
ac t ions ,  and then d i scuss  only  the  l a t t e r ,  and (b) a t  t h e  same time 
make a l l  p a r t i c i p a n t s  i n  the  case  frames f o r  p r imi t ives  ob l iga tory .  
11 So, f o r  example, Fi l lmore would express t h e  case frame f o r  see" a s  
(OBJECT DATIVE) and f o r  "learn" (OBJECT AGENT). While Schank (1973 
pp. 220-1) expresses both verbs  by an underlying p r imi t i ve  PITRANS 
together  with a  case  frame, f o r  t h e  p r imi t i ve ,  containing a t  l e a s t  A,  
0 and R (Fi l lmore would c a l l  R by D), The ind iv idua l  l e t t e r s  f o r  
cases assigned by d i f f e r e n t  authors  need no t  d e t a i n  us,  nor need t h e i r  
con t r a s t i ng  i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  of t he  case  names, f o r  t h e  p resen t  point  i s

of su r f ace  verbs  l i k e  t h i s  one whose su r f ace  case  frames a r e  d i f f e r e n t  
and whose Schankian p r imi t i ve  a c t  i s  t h e  same, 
It fol lows-from (b) above t h a t ,  f o r  Schank, t h e i r  "deep" case  
frame must the re fore  be the  same too. Since, f o r  him, every sur face  
ve tb  has a main a c t  expressing i t ,  the re  i s  c l e a r l y  going to  be a  
problem with t h i s  consequence of (b) un l e s s  he i s  prepared t o  say t h a t  
t he re  i s  no necessary r e l a t i o n  a t  a l l  between a verb ' s  case  frame and 
the  case frame of i t s  corresponding pr imi t ive  ac t .  It may well be 
poss ib le  t o  defend such a pos i t ion  w i t h i n  h i s  theory, but he w i l l  s t i l l  
be l e f t  wi th  the  d i f f i c u l t y  that: verbs  with q u i t e  d i f f e r e n t  semantic 
behaviour ( fo r  Fi l lmor ian  case  d i f f e r ences  a t e  not super? i c i81)  have 
i d e n t i c a l  behaviour i n  h i s  system, There i s  bound t o  be a  lack  of 
d iscr iminat ion consequent upon Schank's all-cases-are-obligatory view 
unless  some ca re fu l  avoiding ac t ion  i s  taken, t h a t  he  has  not y e t ,  t o  
my knowledge embarked upon, 
However, Schank would probably n o t  wish t o  take advantage of t h i s  
l a s t  p o s s i b i l i t y  because he does no t  himself hold the  view t h a t  
11 
conceptual case i s  e n t i r e l y  independent of surface  s t r u c t u r e  consid- 
era t ions" ,  as  was wrongly a t t r i b u t e d  t o  him by Bruce (ibid.p,338), 
and f o r  the  simple reason t h a t  he in tends  t h a t  case s t r u c t u r e  i n  
conceptual izat ions sha l l  resolve  t h e  case  ambiguities present  i n  
English preposi t ion  construct ions.  Schank (1973) makes t h i s  q u i t e  
c l e a r ,  and I s h a l l  r e t u r n  tc~ ilt when discuss ing preposi t ion  construct-  
ions  i n  the  next  sect ion.  Thus, s i nce  Schankian case  frames f o r  
p r imi t ives  a r e  - not  independent o f  a l l  surface  s t r u c t u r e  considera t ions ,  
he does have the  problem above presented by the con t r a s t  of "see" and 
11 learn",  
The burden of the l a s t  arguments have been to show t h a t  three  
d i f f e r en t  pos i t ioas  on the question of "what a re  case frames - for?"  
a r e  unsat is fac tory  : 
( i )  t h a t  they a re  simply f o r  surface verbs : Fillmore's 1968 
posi t ion ,  argued against  along the l i n e s  sketched above a s  ea r ly  as  
Schank (1969), 
( ii) tha t  underlying s t ruc tures  containing primit ive ac t ions  do no t  
require  case  frames a t  a l l :  the Generative Semaqtics pos i t ion ,  f o r  
example, Pos ta l  (1971), 
( i i i )  t ha t  underlying s t ruc tures  containing primit ive act ions a r e  case 
frames f o r  those primit ives and, moteover, a r e  a l l  obl igatory case 
frames: Schank's posi t ion j u s t  discussed. 
Let m e  now r e s t a t e  the pos i t ion  of the  present system, as  i t  
concerns formulas, Formulas a r e  meaning s t ruc tures  f o r  surface word 
senses, Formulas f o r  surface  verbs can be in terpre ted  as  case frame$ 
-
f o r  the  verbs, i n  t ha t  they contain case subparts a t  the  top leve l  
( i , e o  depending d i r e c t l y  on the head ac t ion  primitive) thd t  the formula 
maker has considered necessary t o  express as pa r t  o f  the meaning of 
the verb. Thus, the formula f o r  "break" given e a r l i e r  (10) contains 
case subparts a t  the top l e v e l  ( i .eo depending d i r ec t ly  on the head 
primit ive STRIK) INSTrument, GOAL, OBJect and Agent(=underlylng SUBJect), 
The formula maker i s  concerned only with specifying, as b e s t  as  he can, 
t h e  semantic preferences of the  pa r t i cu l a r  surface word i n  question, 
If it were a verb he would semantical ly speci fy  the  p re fe r red  agent ,  
say, of t h a t  ac t ion ,  w i t b n o  i m p l i c i t  reference  to agenthood a s  such. 
The same goes f o r  the  o t h e r  cases:  he  would attempt to put those cases 
i n t o  a f o p u l a  t h a t  he t h ~ u g h t  necessary to  specify t he  meaning of the  
ac t ion ,  Consider

Charniak has argued (1975) t h a t  the  method af formula coding 
r e s u l t s  i n  top l e v e l  case subformulas t h a t  cannot appear i n  the

where t h e  containment group (SELF I N )  i nd ica tes  t ha t  t he  l i q u i d  objec t

group ((MAN(Tmu FART))TO) indica tes  t h a t  t h i s  movement i s  i n  the 
d i r ec t ion  of a  human aperture,  These two groups appear a t  the top  l e v e l  
of the formula, and thus dependent on the  head primitive act ion  C ~ ~ ~ ~ .  
However, l a t e r  inferent ia l  procedures of ext rac t ion  (see below) would 
show, 8s with "break" (10) e a r l i e r ,  t h a t  the r e a l  dependency of the two 
groups was on MOVE, However, the  requirement 1s observed that  the 
Fillmorean obl igatory cases (only Agent presumably) f o r  "d r~nk"  appear 
a t  the  t o p  l eve l ,  and the  o t h e r  case groups - containment and d i rec t lon  - 
most c e r t a i n l y  could appear a t  the  surface  with 'drink'  as  in:  
(19) John drank the  beer  up t h rwgh  h i s  nose wi th  a straw and in to

where both cases appear a t  the surface. Charniak i s  confusing what

say. The diifelrence i s  made c l e a r  i n  (19) i f  we choose t o  say some-

In  t h i s  sec t ion  on formulas I have t r i e d  t o  j u s t i f y  t h e  i n t e r -  
r o l  e of case description formulas : by claiming BOTH t h a t  
they give a meaning s t ruc ture  t ha t ,  under inferences processes, can 
provide a r e a l  underlying s t r u c t u r e  fo r  t e x t  AND t h a t  they must include 
enough of the  surface  case behaviour (of the verb meaning being expressed) 
t o  give procedural power i n  analyzing the input  surface sentences. It 
seems to m e  e s sen t i a l  to  p re se rveho th  these ro l e s ,  and to  avoid the 
path taken, i n  the i r  d i f f e r e n t  manners, by Schank, Fillmore and the 
Generative Semanticists,  qf displa$ing a f u l l  underlying s t ruc tu re  
d i r e c t l y  without the  processes t h a t  reach i t .  I argued e a r l i e r  t h a t  
each of those th ree  gave only a f i l l e d - i n  or- f ina1 , s t ruc turg  which i n  
i t s e l f  gives no h i n t s  as  t o  how you get  there. 
The generat ive l i n g u i s t  argues, of course, t h a t  he i s  not  t ry ing  
t o  reach such a s t f u c t u r e  a t  a l l ,  bu t  to generate surface s t ruc tb re s

a q u i t e  d i f f e r e n t  and more i n t e r e s t i n g  matter,  His conceptualizations 
are f i l l e d - i n  s t ruc tu re s ,  with no procedural capacity. However, at

(and i n  (Schank 1973, p. 229)).  These o b j e c t s  a r e  much more fund- 
amental t o  h i s  approach than i s  genera l ly  r e a l i z e d ,  f o r  they do give i t  
more procedural  power than  one could envisage from looking only a t  t h e

Each parap la te  corresponds t o  one of the  cases i n  the inventory, which 
i s  the same as the  inventory used t o  const ruct  formulas. Many para- 
p l a t e s ,  however, may correspond t o  a  s i n g l e  case, A parap la te  has the  
form of two template-skeletons connected by a  l a b e l  i nd i ca t ing  the  
case expressed by the  parap la te ,  where by template-skeleton I mean an 
e n t i t y  l i k e  a  teppla te  except t h a t ,  instead of  a  formula a t  each of i t s

the functions i n  both pa r t s  of a paraplate are s a t i s f i e d  by a p a i r  of 
templates (and the template f o r  the preposit ional  phrase i s  nlormally

In e a r l i e r  descr ipt ions  I have distinguished paraplates from

So, i f  we were representing " ~ o h n  picked up the s t a t u e  made oul

(31) John jumped on t h e  box 
where the  l a s t  ph rase  i s  genuinely ambiguous between TO and LOCA c a s e

be i n t e r p r e t e d  a s  TO). Thus under "on" we would p r o p e r l y  expect

But l e t  u s  turn t o :

one might imagine sorie e x p e c t a t i o n a l  f o r c e  t o  b e  drawn from t h e  case

But i n  general ,  i t  i s  c lear  t h a t  the  parap la tes  do not  funct ion 
expecta t ional ly ,  except i n  the  sense t ha t  by looking f i r s t  a t  the

where we would not  only be resolving the cake of the  p r e p o s i t ~ o n a l

where the  senses of "branch" might give r i s e  to  a corresponding number 
of templates and we would always p re fe r  the one t h a t  matched f u r t h e r  
up the  paraplate  s tack,  a s  i n  (Wilks 1975a), 
The reader may have been s t ruck  by an overlap of case content 
between t h e  parap la tes  and formulas, For  example, i n  (10) the  form- 
ula f o r  "break", t h e  head ac t ion  CAUSE has a dependent (THING INST). 
Yet, i f  w e  were analyzing the standard sentence "He broke the window 
with a hammer", we  would expect to  use a stack of paraplates under 
"with", containing a substack whose left-hand ac t ion  was CAUSE, and 
i n  it f ind  the  appropr ia te  paraplate  f o r  tying together the two tem- 
plates f o r  t h a t  sentence with an INST t i e .  This l a t t e r  information 
might seem t o  overlap heavlly with t h a t  contained i n  the formula (10) 
and t h e  question a r i s e s  whether i t  need be s t a t ed  twice, 
However, although the  t w ~  f o m s  of information overlap the re  i s  
no reason t o  be l i eve  they a r e  t he  same: the  parap la tes  r e f l e c t  the  
case  ambiguity of English p repos i t ions  while  the formulas r e f l e c t  only

ex t rac t ion ,  see  below), There i s  no reason to  suppose t h a t  one form 
f o r  da ta  can s u f f i c e  f o r  both these  a c t i v i t i e s ,  However, Schank does 
make t h i s  assumption, and the  point  he re  may become c l e a r e r  a f t e r  some

Another pecu l ia r  f e a t u r e  of SchankTs treatment  of t he se  phenomena 
i s  h i s  suggest ion ( ib id .  p. 232) t h a t  any order ing of p repos i t i on

notion of "preference", i n  case a s  elsewhere (Wilks 1973a), depends on 
following a number of possibilities breadth- f i r s t  f o r  a  while before

which makes i t  a curious implementation of i t ,  is t h a t  i t  dea l s  with

The strong point of d i f fe rence ,  between Riesbeck's system and 
t h e  one described here, concerns the  role of uninhibited "expect-

Case extract ion inferences 
Extraction inferences produce new template-like forms from the 
case  content of formulas embedded i n  source templates: those t h a t  
have been matched with t ex t  sentence f ragrnents, They a r e  s ty led  
"template-like" here  only to ind ica te  t h a t  they have not  been matched 
with input t e x t ,  And hence the infer red  proposit ions they represent  
have not necessar i ly  been s ta ted  e x p l i c i t l y  i n  the input tex t ,  Let 
us f i r s t  see t h e  e f f e c t  of doing t h i s ,  and then the mechanism tha t  
does i t ,  In  what follows, we extend the "short form" of templates 
(obtained by wr i t ing  square brackets round English words, c lus tered 
a t  th ree  nodes to show the d i s t r ibu t ion  of formulas i n  the f u l l

The extracted templates are t i ed  by dotted l i n e s  t o  the source template 
from which they have been extracted, and the  case name on the dotted 
l i n e  shows the case type of the extract ion,  The inferences cover both

recapitulated here. In  the implementation described in  those refer-  
ences, the extract ions were purely "problem driven", i n  tha t  they were 
only done when some problem of reference resolution i n  the t ex t  demand- 
ed tha t  the representation be deepened, However, t ha t  was a s t r a t eg ic  
consideration i n  no way a consequence of the nature of extract ions:  
they could equally well be data driven, and be executed a f t e r  every 
matching of a  sentence with templates, 
The difference between paraplates and extractions should  be c lear  
from (38) because i t  contains both an INST paraplate-imposed t i e  between 
main clause and preposition phrase templates, - and an INST extract ion 
from the main clause template yielding an extracted template equivalent 
to  "John uses a thing(=a shotgun)",

not  contain an instrument specif icat ion.  So we would not expect any

There can be legi t imate  dispute  about the l i m i t s  t o  which case

1975) would consider t h a t  "John wrote a l e t t e r "  should be an inference 
from 1 received a l e t t e r  from John , and he describes a l a t t i c e  
scheme in which an AGENT case is generally and legi t imately  inferred 
from a SOURCE case, That could only be achieved with the "SOURCE 
spec ia l i s t1 '  i n  the  present system from a very f u l l ,  s p e c i ~ i c ,  
formula f o r  ' l e t t e r T  (and extract ions  can come from nouns and not  
only from verbs) i n  which a petson) source was specif ied a t  the  top 
level of the formula, 
Two po in t s  should be not iced,  i n  conclusion, about t h i s  method of 
producing a qemantic s t r u c t u r e  appropr ia te  t o  the e r g a t i v e  paradigm, 
F i r s t ,  the  "case s p e c i a l i s t s "  a r e  not  i n  general dependent upon the  
p a r t i c u l a r  f o m u l a  i n  which they opera te  ( e  the  word the  f o m u l a  
is f o r ) ,  nor  upon the  p r imi t i ve  t h a t  i s  the  fonmlla head, Each 
s p e c i a l i s t  does, of course contain ranked s ide  condi t ions  but- th-y  
a r e  not ,  except i n  s p e c i a l  cases,  dependent on the  head of the  
formula, It i s  no t  the  case t h a t  every l i n e  of the  specialist f o r  
case X, say, i s  of the  form " i f  t he  head of the  source formula i s  Y 
do 2, else ,,. " This po in t  w i l l  be important m the  next sect ion 
when we consider Charniak' s arguments concerning c as?. 
Secondly, t h i s  way of desc r ib ing  the ergatwe paradigm i s  
n a t u r a l l y  d i f f e r e n t  from F i l l m o r e ' s  because, as has been noted, he i s  
pr imar i ly  concerned wi th  r e s t r i c t i o n s  of the  generat ion (=productron !) 
of sur face  sentences by means of h i s  ordered Subject Selcztiozl Rule:

iencer  i t  i s  the  sub,iect ,  e l s e  i f  t he re  i s  an instrument .... and so 
on". This  way of l ~ k i n g  a t  things assumes t h a t  John must i n  e f f e c t ,  
already be marked as an agent,  hammer a s  an I n s t q e n t  o r  Object and 
so on, Simmons' a n a l y s i s  paradigms f o r  the  same example a r e ,  a s  we

r e a l l y  making use  of case, and the  present  system i s  one of those he 
c r % t i c i s e s  i n  t h i s  connection, Argunients along the same general 
l i n e s  a r e  t o  be  founa i n  Welin (1975). I th ink  Ch-rniak's arguments 
a r e  important and s t imula t ing ,  though i n  sode ways misguided. They 
have the  paradoxical sidk-effect of showing ;hat not  even Fillmore 1 s  
r e a l l y  making use of  case. I s h a l l  b r i e f l y  sur,marise seven aspects  
of ~ h a r n i a k ' s  complex argument, an$ make some reply,  
(i) The p a $ i b i ~ n  Argument, Charniak d i s t ingu ishes  between case 
nota t ion  and pos i t ion  no ta t i on  ( ib id .  pp. '3~4). I f  we have an event 
of Jack opening the  door with a key then, f o r  Chamiak, a  case form of 
that would be: 
(PREDICATE EV OPEN) (AGENT EV JACK) (OBJECT EV DOOR) (INSTRUMENT EV KEY) 
whereas OPEN(JACK, DOOR, KEY)' 
would be  pure pos i t i on  nota t ion .  He argues t h a t  many A 1  systems claim 
t o  be using case no ta t ion  but  i n  f a c t  a r e  using only pos i t i on  notbtion: 
dqing places  a r b i t r a r i l y  t o  pass p a r t i c u l a r  case arguments t o  a  
predicate ,  
(ii) The evacuation argument. Charniak argues t h a t  the  standard 
bene f i t  of case --- the  prdduction o f ,  say, the  e rga t ive  paradigm f o r  
11 open" from a case representat ion a s  i n  (i) above, together with a 
subjec t  se l ec t ion  r u l e  --- ean be obtained equally well with the  
pos i t ion  nota t ion ,  ( ibid.  p. 17), Iq other  words, the whole busin- 
ess can be  evacuated of case a l toge ther ,  with the case names remaim- 
11 i ng  perhaps a s  mnemonic va r i ab le  names" ( ibid.  p.  27). 
( i i i )The  l i n e a r i t y  argument. Charniak argues t h a t  the e;xpression 
of meaning i n  terms of case i s  non-linear. Schematically, i f  i t  was 
l i n e a r  i t  would look l i k e :  
while the  meaning of "see" would have EXPERIEHCER where the above 
has AGENT, However, i n  A1 systems i t  tends t o  be don-linear, 
l ike :  
MEANING (LOOK) =MEANING (OBSERVE ,AGENT) 
o r ,  i n  o ther  words, the  meaning of MTANING(AGENT) cannot be computed 
independently of knowing t h a t  t h e  agent i s  the agent of OBSERVE. 
(iv) Theproduct ion argument, Charniak argues t h a t  t h e n o t i o n  
of case f o r  Fillmore i s  es s e n t i a l l y  connected with i t s  productive 
generat ive  r o l e  i n  cont ro l l ing  surface grammaticality, and t h a t  
since A I  systems are preoccupied with analysis ,  they are not  making 
use of case, 
(v) The case-content argument, Charniak argues tha t  we are 
never to ld  what i t  i s  t o  be  an agent as such, Th i s  i s  a subargument 
of ( i i i )  above t h a t  one cannot compute MEANING(AGENT) independently, 
(vi) The surface  ana lys i s  argument. Charniak demands t h a t  the  
"semantics-based systems" i n  A1 aJso do sur face  case ana lys i s ,  of the  
type found i n   illm more's papers. He argues t h a t  some such analyses,  
like t he  formula gi-ven e a r l i e r  f o r  "drink", qc tua l ly  exclude t h e  
s u r f a c e  forms, but I showed e a r l i e r  t h a t  t h i s  i s  not  so. 
( v i i )  The case-inf erence argument. Charniak argues t ha t  
11 a system us ing  case f o r  semantic represen ta t ion  should provide case 
infe.zencesll. The meaning of case CASE would  then be "the set  of 
inferences m e  tan  Wke &bout X, knowing only t h a t  X i s  i n  case 
In reply ,  I th ink  Charniak misjudges where the hear t  of h i s  argu- 
ment l i e s  by giv ing undue prominence t o  r a t h e r  b i z a r r e  arguments l i k e  
( i )  and ( i i ) ,  whereas the  se r ious  ones a r e  those l i k e  ( iv) and (v i )  
t h a t  draw a t t e n t i o n ,  a s  t h i s  paper has t r i e d  t o  do from a q u i t e  d i f f e r -  
I r ent point  of view, t o  t h e  need to  r e l a t e  t he  use of case i n  semantics- 
based understanding systems" t o  i t s  o r i g i n a l  Fillmorean r o l e  as a 
c l a s s i f i e r  of superficial formsl l ike  preposi t ion  and o the r  case con- 
s t r u c t i o n s  i n  English. I would paraphrase Charniak's W r n e n t  on this 
1 t po in t ,  perhdps un fa i r l y ,  a s  claiming t h a t  case" takes i t s  meaning from 
surface  phenomena and there fore  any attempt t o  locate  it only i n  a deep 
t! semantics, wholly divorced from such phenomena, i s  t o  make case" mean- 
ingless .  My answer t 6  t ha t ,  and i t  i s  a se r ious  charge, i s  t he  
presen ta t ion ,  here  and elsewhere, of a system tha t  - both parses  sur face  
English by means of case - and expresses i t s  underlying semantics i n  the  
same nota t ion ,  
The t h i r d  aspec t  of CharniakTs arguments, l i k e  (v) and ( v i i ) ,  i s  
h i s  concern with the  p rec i se  content  of the  cases,  This bothers  every- 
one, including Fi l lmore,  who had beer. unable t o  provide i t ,  and so i f  
t h e  production of such d e f i n i t i o n s  i s  made a necessary condition of 
us ing case  then F i l l a o r e ,  l i k e  everyone e l s e ,  f a i l s  the t e s t .  
Let Be, i p  conclusion, reply t o  t he  arguments above i n  a l i t t l e  
more detail. 
( i >  i s ,  I th ink,  simply confused, The two (case and pos i t ion)  a r e  
s imply equivalent forms of information, provided one knows t h a t  t he  
" f i r s t  argument i s  the  agent" etc. e tc .  Charniak himself seems t o  see  
t h i s  when he admits ( ib id .  p, 4)  t h a t  one could have case no ta t ion  
without case,  and case without case nota t ion ,  
( i i )  shows only t h e  t r i v i a l i t y  t h a t  any cornputatidla1 system could  
have a l l  its top level not ions replaced by gensyms, l i k e  WQ5.567, and 
func t ion  i n  the  same way, This would not  however show t h a t  t h e  
no t ions  being programmed were n o t  e s s e n t i a l  to  the  meaningful func t ion  
and i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  o f  the  system. I n  any system doing proposi t ional  
l og i c ,  t h e  not ion AND can properly be replaced by a t ru th- table  vec to r  
1000, but t h a t  does not show that the  not ion AND represents i s  
vacuous, o r  a mere mnemonic convention. 
( i i i )  does not e s t ab l i sh  tha t  systems must be  wholly l i n e a r ,  i n  
Charniak's sense. However, i t  would c l e a r l y  be a  defect  i n  a  system 
i f ,  every t i m e  an inference about AGENT was made, the  system had to 
look and see  wl4at verb i t  was the agent o f ,  o r  what the pr imit ive  
act ion coding the  verb was, Some examples of Schank's t h a t  Charniak 
discusses do show t h a t  t h i s  access t o  the head primit ive i s  somerlmes 
made, and Charnzak then argues t h a t  the case i s  ipso f ac to  dispensible,  
and t h e  inferehces a r a b a t t e r  seen as  inferences from that7-head G r i m -  
i t i v e  aqtion,  But, as  T pointed out. when d i scuss ing  ex t rac t ion ,  the 
I I case spec ia l i s t s i '  i n , t h e  present system, a t  l e a s t ,  do no t  generally 
inake such reference) back co t h e  acr;fun head, So, f o r  example, t he  
"GOAL-specialist" did not have t o  find out ,  b e f o r e  operat ing,  what the 
act ion was t h a t  a  given GOAL was a goal o f .  
(iv) and (vi) These arguments are p a r t l y  t r u e  but t h e i r  points  a r e  
aet by presenting a system, l i k e  the  preference semantlics one, t h a t  
ilses case both a s  a semantic representat ion and a  parsing mechanism 
(the paraplates)  , 
(v > It i s  t rue  tha t  no system, Fillmore's fncluded, has given 
precise  d e f i n i t i o n  of the  cases beyond the  most general indicat ions ,  
such a s  that agency i s  concerned w i t h  i n i t i a t i n g  force  etc. T h i s  
c r i t i c i sm i s  t r u e  f a r  beyond case: i t  appl ies  equal ly  t o  notions o f  
thinghood, causation and movement etc, It i s  j u s t  a f a c t  t h a t  basic  
semantic not ions arelvague,and perhaps necessa r i ly  so. It i s  c e r t a i n l y  
no ground f o r  lament, and does not  prevent us speaking prec i se ly  i n  
everyday l i f e .  Provided, therefore ,  t h a t  a programed system can 
perfarm prec i se ly  using these vague not ions,  we can demand no more. 
The f a l l a c y  i s  t o  imagine t h a t  underneath the  vague notions used i n  
thought, speech and wri t ing ,  t he re  must l l e  p r ec i se  c r i t e r i a  f o r  t h e i r  
use. This i s  a pe r s i s t en t  f a l l a c y  t h a t  has received much a t t e n t i o n  
i n  Twentieth Century philosophy. 
In t h e  present  system, a s  i n  many others,  spec i f i ca t ions  ( se lec t -  
iona l  o r  p te fe re f i t i a l )  a r e  given of the agents  of p a r t i c u l a r  ac t iqns  
[human f o r  "think? a$imate f o r  "see", and: so on),  One could argue 
t h a t  "agents a s  such" a re ,  i f  anything, the union df a l l  such agents,  
but t h a t  w i l l  no t ,  and cannot, y ie ld  an in tens ional  d e f i n i t i o n  of the  
notion. Extrac t ian  operat ing on such specif i c a t i dns  ( the  "SUBJ- 
11 spec ia l i s t " )  y i e l d s  Pnferences such as t h a t  some animate does so and 
s?"' but  these do no t  meet Charniakt s utll~and i n  (vii) above. 
I t e i s  worth not if ig-at  t h i s  point  t h a t  Charniak puts  h i s  demand 
(or t e s t  f o r  "using zase") i n  such a way ( in  points  (v) and ( v i i )  
above) t h a t  i t  i s  hard t o  see  what could s a t i s f y  i t :  what r e s u l t  of 
computation could we conceivably expect as the  value  of MEANING(AGENT)? 
I would maintain t h a t  ex t rac t ions ,  a s  described above, are most 
c e r t a i n l y  "case in? erences", bu t  a r e  not "the s e t  of inferences one 
can make about X ,  knowing only t h a t  X i s  i n  case C A S ~ I y l b i d .  p. 19)  
because t h a t  s e t  i s  not  t he  s o r t  of th ing one wants t o  know i n  a 
language understanding sys  tern. The "case s p e c i a l i s t s "  i n  ogreration 
produced inferences  taking information from the  appropr ia te  
po in t s  i n  t h e  represen ta t ion ;  but  from knowing merely t h a t  John i s  an 
agent nothing i n t e r e s t i n g  follows or  could follow! (And from t h a t  
f a c t  nothing follows t o  t h e  e f f e c t  t h a t  agency i s  vacuous, a s  Charniak 
seems t o  th ink) ,  The most t ha t  could fol low would be t h a t  John does 
somethfng o r  i n s t i g a t e s  sortne a r t .  
We -could hatdly  i n f e r  a t  t h a t  point  t h a t  John w a s  animate, because 
t h a t  i s  presumably information genera l ly  at tached to  "John", and, i n  
any case,  some verbs ( l i k e  "calculate1')  may have a s e l e c t i o n  or  prefer-  
ence r e s t r i c t i o n  on t h e i r  agent t h a t  is more general than animate, so 
t h a t  being animate could not  follow from being an agent. 
To i n f e r  anything use fu l ,  a s  i n  the  ex t rac t ions  e a r l i e r  i n  the 
peaper, we have t~ look n o t  j u s t  a t  what John i s  the  agent  of (which 
would make t h e  whole th ing c i r c u l a r  f o r  Charniak, by argument kl), 
but p o t e n t i a l l y  a t  a l l  t h e  information ava i l ab l e  i n  t h e  representation-. 
It i s ,  perhaps, s i g n i f i c a n t  t h a t  agent i s  the  case t h a t  makes 
Charniak's po in t  best .  The other  ex t rac t ions  answer i t  b e t t e r ,  f o r  
example i n  t he  way the  I' INST-specialist" c r ea t e s  an ext rac ted  Pemplate 
wi th  ac t i on  USE; o r  t h e  way t h e  "GOAL-specialist" ext rac ted  an 
in? erence "John s t r i k e s  stags" i n  a manner independent of the  f a c t  
t h a t  the  source ac t ion  was " f i r e  at",  f o r  the  "GOAL-specialist" did 
not consult  the  source verb name o r  i t s  head pr imit ive  act ion CAUSE. 
O r ,  again, the  way i n  which common-sense inference ru le s  (Wllks 1973c, 
1975a, 197513, but not  discussed i n  t h i s  paper) would operate on - any 
such extracted GOAL template and i n f e r  t h a t  the corresponding agent 
wanted the  GOAL (whatever i t  was). And an inference r u l e  l i k e  t h i s  
l a t t e r  can operate only i f - i t  can loca te  the corresponding agent, 
Sob when we extracted the  GOAL equivalqrit to " ~ o h n  s t r i k e s  stags", 
we tsould have ( in  order t o  operare the  new inference ru le )  t o  be ab le  
t o  f ind  t h a t  John was the agent of the  extracted template i f  we whnted 
t~ in? e r  f u r t h e r  t h a t  John wanted t o  s t r i k e  the  s tags .  The agent 
(John) w i I l  of course be the  formula i n  the  f i r s t  pos i t ion  of the  
extracted template, and Charniak might then say t h a t  tha t  does nok 
requ i re  agency but  only access t o  a f i r s t  template posi t ion.  This 
would be  a revers ion t o  the  bad pos i t ion  argument (i), and the 
answer i s  simply t h a t  the  mechanism goes t o  t h e  f i r s t  posi t iou because 
t h a t  i s  where the  agent has been put;  i n  j u s t  t h e  way t h a t  d o l l a r s  
a r e  wr i t ten  before the decimal point  and cents afterwards yet  t h a t  
f a c t  does not  allow us  t o  dispense with the  notions of do l l a r s  and 
cents  i n  f i n a n c i a l  calculat ions.  However, the  important point here 
i s  t h a t  the  "seeker of the  agent" would seek i t  generally: it  would 
not  matter whaE t h e  act ion ( s t r ik ing)  i n  the  extracted template was. 
1 1  The real point behind Charniakls position" argument (i) is that no 
A I  systems have such general rou t ines ,  and hence an agent f o r  one 
verb could  be s tored  quite d i f f e r e n t l y  f r o m  that f o r  another  because 
there are no Such routines that would ever find this out! And that 
I believe is not the  case,

~ ~ O V S " E  HOLDS HEARINGS ON ATE?' LEGISLATION 
Just prioz to adjournment of the 94th C~ngress , second session the Youse 
of Representaf~ves held preliminary heanngs on HR12323, (Vashin.qton 
R 9 o r t  I 7/76). The Hoyse Subcommittee on Commtlrticati~na had sought testl- 
mony on three primary topics : (1) the advantages aiid disadvantages of 
Federal Comrnunicatians Commisgion (FCC] policy allowlng ~o~npetition in the 
teletommunications industry, (2) the idcntifiaation of unresolved issues 
relating to competition, 2nd (3) identification of further information 
necessary prior to a subcommittee decision 
AT&T Teseimony. ATGT  hairm man John D. deButts testified that the proposed 
legislation would not affect the profitabiility of his company, since ATGT 
would in any case petition the FCC for rates which would allow sufficient 
earnings to attract capital. DeButts re~terated A T U  s prlmary argument, 
however that such competition would likely shCf* cost burdens from business 
to resiaential users of the system. D-e.Bvtdt;s mainta,inecl under questioning 
that competition permitted by the FCC had required ATET to adapt its design 
standards and operating methods to competitive equ;ipment, had complicated 
network planning, and had divided markGts which copld more economically be 
handled (by virtue of economies of scale) by a single system. 
Response from compet;t<ve vendors. Representatives of nunerous companies 
competitive with ATGT in both voice and data coiiununications testified during 
the second day of hearings. Ph~1i .p  Wittaker of Satellit0 Business Systcms 
(SBS) argued t h a t  ATgT was blrt one of many companies ifl carnmand of the 
technology and that f u ~ t h e r  national economic development required the 
resources and expertise oi, these conlpanies in a competitive environment, in 
order to meet the needs of specia l ized users. i-Ie maintained ; that  SBS :gill 
make available services not now offered nr proposed by other carriers and 
which will be significantly advantagous to users. Telenet Vice President 
Philip Walker submitted that if the AT$T legislation were effective in 1974, 
Telenet's applications to provide packet switching services [which are not 
provide-d by AT4T) would never have been approved. Walker proposed that ATET 
be perfiltted to provide competitive services only through subsidiary compa- 
nies Peter McCloskey of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers 
Association (CBEMA] testified in favor of competition in the manufacture of 
terminal equipment, arguing that the market itself provides the mechanism 
necessary to allow users a choice of equipment at the lowest possible prices 
FCC C h a z .  W i Z e y .  Richard Wiley opened by describing exrsting exceptions 
to monopolistic netwo'rk control, including independent telephone compahics 
and iddependent ly produced equipment used by t el cyhone companies . Wi 1 cy also 
stated that the proposed legislation would jeopardize significant new 
developments such as data comnunications and EFT systems, and would allow 
concentrated control over this "increasin~ly vital and sensitive information 
system." The FCC had in May of this year submitted written comments oppos 
ing the proposed legislation, on the grounds that it would inhibit the 
development a f  consumer alternatfues, and allow higher casts; the FCC also 
maintained that ATBT would be allowed to collect and dispense "substantial 
subsidies without effective Federal oversight . 
Speakrng for the Justice Department, Assistant Attorney General Baker prafqed 
FCC regulation for allowing competition where possible in the common carriar 
field Baker stated that competition brought substantial benefits, and ursed 
the Congress to pursue such colnpetitive solutions. Baker maintained that 
existing data to subs.tantiat6 AT(Tfs claims of economy of scale was in~onclu- 
sive; he indicated that local message switching may involve economies of sgalc, 
but that the manufhcture of terminal equipment probably did not. 
SENATE SCIENCE REID TECHNqLbGY COE1MITl'EE AE~P@WIZATIQN 
The Scnate in recent bearlngs considered three alternative plans to re- 
structure its complex syqtom of 174 subco~fttees which relate to science and 
technology. The Temporary Selecr committee to Study the senate Conmittee 
System is- focusing on this ated by considering primarily three alternative 
plans which, if adopted. wolrld bd subject to furyeher nodif'cation. The first 
plan would retain the existing committee organization, but would significantly 
reduce. the number of committee members and reorganize committee jurisdic~ions .
This plan inuolves se~eral~diffeerent options, one of which would create a 
Committee on Science and Technology which woula have jurisdiction over science, 
engineering and technolog (including aeronautics and space) its oversight 
jurisdiction would enconpars the new White house Office of Sciettce and Tech- 
nolagy Policy, the Naeional Bureau of Standards, the National Science Foundatipg r 
and the Congressional Office d Technology Ass~ssmeM. The second plan would 
consolidate the existing thirtr -one committees into twelve standing committees, 
with a possible option to again create a Cornif t ee  on Science and Technology.. 
The third plan would create five broad co~1ttees on goyernnient humah, natural 
and financial resources, apd on defense and for~ign policy, each of which would 
have responsibilities for r e l c v ~ t  agcqcies in the Executive Branch. 
The Senate is expected to deal with these proposals when the 95th Congress 
convenes next year.

&mug-nt of Federally kcnded ~o@ute r i z ed  ~ o d e Z s I ~  (#-  enc luse $1.00) . The 
r e p o r t  concludes that appropr ia te  standards from* t h e  Depaqtment of Commerce, 
and guidance from t h e  General Services Administration should be provided f ~ r  
improving management of such models. GAO developed and proposed a phased 
approach fo'r planning, managing and cont ro l l ing  the development of  computerized 
models which cons i s t s  of f ive  phases: problem de f in i t i bn ,  preliminary design, 
de t a i i ed  design, e v a l u a t i ~ n ,  and maintenance. According t o  GAO,, t h i s  approach 
will reduce costs overruns and r e s u l t  i n  models b e t t e r  su i t ed  t o  the needs for, 
which' they are designed.
