The Processing of Referring Expressions within a Semantic Network 
John R. Anderson 
Yale University 
Frege (1892) is credited with emphasizing the 
distinction between sense and reference. His fa- 
mous example involved the mornin$ star and the 
evenin$ star. Despite the fact that they both re- 
fer to the same object (i.e., Venus), they have 
different senses as witnessed by the fact that 
sentence (i) is not synonymous with sentence (2): 
(i) The morning star is the morning star. 
(2) The morning star is the evening star. 
This philosophical issue has similarities to an 
issue that is of importance to understanding nat- 
ural language processing: How do subjects process 
referring expressions to extract internal repre- 
sentations (a) of their meaning and (b) of their 
referents in the external world. The example sen- 
tence that we will be returning to in this paper 
is: 
(3) The first president of the United States 
was a bad husband. 
It is clear that in understanding this sentence 
we both process the subject as a description, 
and identify this as referring to George Wash- 
ington. This paper will try to explain how this 
comes about. As I believe that all interesting 
questions about representation come down to 
questions about memory, I will approach this ques- 
tion from a human memory perspective. 
Some "self-evident" truths about human memory. 
To set up a framework for further dis- 
cussions, I would like to list some of the facts 
that I think we know about human memory -- either 
because of a sophisticated common sense and self- 
observation or because of a mass of experimental 
data: 
(i) Human memory can be conceived of as a 
network of associations among concepts. 
(2) Some nodes in this network refer to in- 
dividuals in the external world. 
(3) Once information is deposited in memory 
it cannot be erased. 
While there are a number of memory theories that 
embody these assumptions, I will be using the ACT 
model (Anderson, 1976) to present the theory and 
discuss the data in this paper. With this brief 
statement of the pre-theoretical biases, I would 
like to turn to an experimental paradigm which 
captures, in expanded time scale, the processes 
that I think are going on when we comprehend re- 
ferring expressions. 
A Mock-up of the Morning Star-EveningStar  Example 
One of the experiments in this series (see 
Anderson, 1977; Anderson & Hastie, 1974 for a 
thorough report) had subjects study a set of facts 
such as (4) - (8): 
(4) The smart Russian is the tall lawyer. 
(5) The smart Russian cursed the salesgirl. 
(6) The smart Russian rescued the kitten. 
(7) The tall lawyer adopted the child. 
(8) The tall lawyer caused the accident. 
The critical manipulation was whether the identi- 
fication sentence (4) was learned some time be- 
fore or some time after sentences (5)-(8). For 
the identification before condition, part (a) of 
Figure i illustrates, very schematically, the 
network structure we thought was created. There 
is a node X set up to represent the individual 
and attached to that node are the various facts 
learned about this person. Part (b) of Figure i 
illustrates the network situation in the identi- 
fication after condition. Becuase the subject 
did not learn of the identity between the two 
individuals until after learning sentences (5)- 
(8), he was led to create two nodes in memory 
which turn out to refer to the same individual. 
It would seem optimal if he could merge nodes 
and \[ together but this would amount to erasing 
memory structures, violating principle 3. Rather 
we assume that the subject encodes a separate 
proposition to the effect that the two individuals 
are identical. This is represented in Figure ib, 
by the link between X and Y labelled with an '='.

The memory representations in Parts (a) vs. 
(b) make different predictions about time to 
verify statements (9) vs. (i0): 
(9) The smart Russian cursed the salesgirl. 
(I0) The smart Russian caused the accident. 
Statement (9) is referred to as a direct statement 
because it is identical to a study statement, 
while statement (i0) is referred to as an infer- 
ence as it can be inferred from statements (4) 
and (8). 
Table i displays subjects' reaction times to 
verify direct statements and inferences in the 
identification before and identification after 
condition? We would expect subjects to show very 
little advantage for direct statement over infer- 
ence in a representation like Figure la since 
there is no special connection preserved between 
the predicates and the referring expressions they

were studied with. In fact the verification times 
are almost identical in the two conditioms. In 
contrast the afte____~r conditlon in Part b of Figure i 
each referring expression is only directly con- 
netted to the predicates it was studied with. To 
verify an inference requires an extra step of ac- 
tivating the path encoding the equality of X and 
Y. Correspondingly, we find an advantage for di- 
rect statements over inference. Finally, note 
that there are many more links attached to node

X in part (a) than to either X or Y in part (b). 
This means there are more irrelevant paths that 
can interfere with finding the desired connection. 
Correspondingly, we find subjects faster to direct 
statement trues in the after condition. 
The data reported in Table I come from the 
first block of reaction time test trials? There 
were four such blocks of trials? The reaction 
time data for all four blocks are displayed in 
Figure 2. Besides illustrating a general speed-up 
over the course of the experiment, the figure il- 
lustrates the differences among the conditions 
gradually disappear over the course of the experi- 
ment. Specifically, the differences between in- 
ference and direct statements in the after condi- 
tion disappears and the differences between iden- 
tification before and identification after condi- 
disappear. 
To account for this across-block trend we 
propose that the subject begins a process of 
copying the predicates from one of the nodes in 
Figure ib to the other node. Th,at is, one node 
is chosen to be abandoned and the other to receive 
all information. Therefore, supposing the subject 
choses to copy from node Y to X, everytime he en- 
counters a fact attached to X he wil l  attempt to 
copy it to Y. Figure 3 illustrates our belief a- 
bout the memory representation by the end of the 
experiment. Note that the node X has been attach-

nections involving Y are dotted to indicate that 
they have become weak through disuse. The after

representation in Figure 3 has become functionally 
almost equivalent to the before representation in 
Figure la. Thus there is little difference between 
inference and direct statement or between the af- 
ter and before condition. 
One might wonder why the subject did not per- 
form this copying when he learned about the iden- 
tity between the two referring expressions rather 
than later in the verification phase of the experi- 
ment. In the ACT memory model such copying opera- 
tions cannot be performed unless the data to be 
copied is active in working memory. At the time 
of studying the identification statement (4) the 
predicates needed for copying would not be active 
in memory. It is only when inferential statements 
like (i0) are encountered in the test that the cop- 
ying can take place. The referring expression 
could be copied while learning the identification 
statement. So the expression tall lawyer might be 
immediately attached to X. Thus, Figure ib might 
be an oversimplification of the state of memory in 
the identification after condition. But in any 
case, the inference effect will not go away until 
the predicates are copied and this will not occur 
until the reaction time test phase. 
Why should we believe this copying explana- 
tion rather than any of the multitude of alterna- 
tive mechanisms that might be offered the explain 
the data in Figure 2. First, it satisfies the 
constraint that the subject not be able to erase 
information from memory and many of the mechanisms 
would not be. Second, unlike many of the other 
mechanisms, it assumes an asymetry in the fate of 
the two individual nodes in Figure lb. One node 
is fated to receive all the information and the 
other node is to be abandoned. It seems reason- 
able that a subject would choose to preserve that 
node which had the more information attached and/ 
or had this information attached more strongly. 
We have been able to demonstrate that subjects do 
abandon the "weaker" node. 
The evidence for this asymetry comes from 
experiments that use a proper name rather than 
one of the definite descriptions. That is, the 
material is the same as in the example except 
that wherever tall lawyer appears a proper name 
like James Bartlett would be used. There is evi- 
dence (Anderson, 1977) that subjects learn mater- 
ial less well involving the proper name than the 
definite description. Correspondingly, we would 
expect subjects to choose to abandon the proper 
name node and maintain the definite description 
node. Evidence for this comes from the follow- 
ing analysis: We would propose that, in the ini- 
tial drilling on the sentence James Bartlett is 
the Russian, in the identification after condi- 
tion subjects copy the James Bartlett name to 
the Russian node. Figure 4 illustrates the mem- 
ory representation with this asymetry. Note that,

experiment that used both proper names and' defin- 
ire descriptions as referring expressions. 
according to this representation, subjects should 
be as fast when verifying an inference predicate 
of James Bartlett as a direct statement predicate. 
This is because the proper name is directly attach- 
ed to both. In contrast, subjects should be much 
slower for an inference predicate to a definite 
description because those predicates have not yet 
directly been attached to node X to which the des- 
cription is attached. To verify these questions 
involves the extra retrieval of the proposition 
that node X equals node Y. Figure 5 presents the 
data from one of the experiments (Anderson & Has- 
tie, 1974) contrasting definite descriptions and 
proper names. As predicted there is a large in- 
ference effect only for definite descriptions in 
the after condition.

Application to Recognition 
of Referring Expression 
The advantage of the paradigm just reviewed 
is that the sequence of states of memory is suf- 
ficiently spread out over time that it is possible 
to map out the changes in memory. I will be pro- 
posing that there is a similar sequence of memory 
states when subjects process referring expressions 
as in (3): 
(3) The first president of the United States 
was a bad husband. 
However, the processing happens so rapidly it is 
not as easy to verify each state in the sequence. 
Figure 6 illustrates two possible sequences 
of information processing. Part (a) illustrates 
the state of memory right after comprehension of

the definite description. A node Y has been crea- 
ted to which there has been attached the "first 
president of USA" description. A separate node, 
X, in memory encodes permanent information about 
George Washington. Part (a) of Figure 6 illus- 
trates a situation analagous to the identifica- 
tion after condition, prior to the identifica- 
tion statement. There are two distinct nodes, un- 
connected, that refer to the same individual. In- 
trospectively, it seems clear that at least some- 
times I comprehend definite descriptions before 
recognizing their referents. For instance, I un- 
derstand the description T_h~ ~resident of France 
in 1970 long before I decide that this is George 
Pompidou. The structure surrounding ~ in Part (a) 
not only provides an embodiment of this pre-iden- 
tificatlon comprehension, it serves as an encod- 
ing of the information that is to guide the search 
for a referent. The ACT theory would use this re- 
presentation to build a pattern that could be 
matched to memory to retrieve the referent. In the 
case of a description llke first president of the 
USA a direct pattern match should suffice to re- 
trieve the referent. In my case for the President 
of France in 1970 description, a more complex prob- 
lem solving strategy had to be evolked. 
Once the description of sentence (3) has 
been comprehended two things can happen: The sub- 
ject can proceed to recognize the referent of the 
definite description and he can go on to compre- 
hend the '~as bad husband" predicate. Depending 
on the order of these two events we will wind up 
with slightly different representations in memory. 
Part (b) of Figure 5 illustrates the state of mem- 
ory after recognition of the description and be- 
fore comprehension of the predicate. As in the 
after condition (Part b of Figure i) a link is 
introduced encoding the identity of X and Y. When 
the predicate is comprehended a representation of 
its meaning can be attached directly to X, giving 
the representation in Part (c) of Figure 6. 
Part (d) illustrates the state of memory 
when the predicate has been comprehended but the 
definite description has not been identified. In 
this case the meaning representation of the pred- 
icate has been attached to node Y. Part (e) of 
Figure 6 illustrates the state of memory when the 
definite description is subsequently recognized. 
Again a link is introduced indicating the identity 
between X and Y. The bad husband predicate, which 
is active in memory, is copied from Y to X. The 
difference between the final state o~ the recog- 
nize-description-then-comprehend-predicate se- 
quence (Part c) and the comprehend-predicate-then- 
54 
recognize-description sequence (part e) is that in 
the latter case the predicate is attached to both 
nodes. This latter situation is like the situation 
in the after condition of the previous memory ex- 
periments. 
What determines which occurs first -- re- 
cognition of description or comprehension of pred- 
icate? In the ACT model both processes can go on 
independently. It would simply be a race between 
two independent processes. Factors such as how 
quickly the predicate is presented (if spoken) or 
how quickly the subject turns to the predicate (if 
printed) will determine the speed of the comprehen- 
sion success. The speed of recognizing the des- 
cription will vary with the difficulty of finding 
its referent. It is clear that neither process 
waits on the other as witnessed by the sentences: 
(Ii) The first prime minister of Canada was a 
bad husband. 
(12) The first president of the United States 
pilacked gibs. 
In (ii) we comprehend the predicate although we 
never find a referent for the subject. In (12) 
we find a referent for the subject although we 
never comprehend the predicate. 
Evidence on the Recognition of Referring Expres- 
sions. 
Right now the contentious reader might be 
thinking "Yes, that is a possible model for the 
processing of referring expressions. Yes, it is 
consistent with the model for your earlier memory 
experiments. Yes, you presented evidence for that 
model. But, is there any independent experimental 
evidence for this model when applied to the real- 
time recognition of definite descriptions?" Be- 
cause of its rapid real-time characteristics it is 
hard to provide particularly direct evidence for 
this process. But there are some consistent ex- 
perimental results: 
A relevant feature to note about Figure 
6c is that it preserves no record that the bad 
husband predicate was asserted via the first pres- 
ident of USA description. In contrast Figure 6e 
does preserve this information. Both representa- 
tions are possible depending on the exact timing 
of description recognition versus predicate com- 
prehension. To the extent that there is a mix- 
ture of these representations we predict both a 
tendency to make confusions about what referring 
expression was used (representation 6c) and that 
subjects will have some residual ability to make 
this discrimination (representation 6e). An ex- 
periment reported by Anderson and Bower (1973) 
supports this dual prediction. They had subjects 
study sentences llke: 
(ii) The first president of the United States 
was a bad husband. 
(12) Abraham Lincoln was a good husband. 
After studying such sentences subjects were asked 
to chose among alternatives such as the following: 
(13) The first president of the United States 
was a bad husband. 
(14) George Washington was a bad husband. 
(15) The first president of the United States 
was a good husband. 
(16) George Washington was a good husband. 
These alternatives were presented to the subject 
randomly ordered but I present them here systemat- 
ically. Subjects were instructed to indicate the 
exact sentence that they had studied in which case 
(13) would be the correct choice. To the extent 
that subjects false alarm more to (14) over (15) 
or (16), this is evidence for a representation like 
Figure 6c where no information is retained about 
the referring expression used. To the extent that 
subjects prefer (13) over (14) this is evidence 
for a representation like Figure 6e. Thus, our 
predictions in terms of preference is (13) > (14) > 
(15) = (16). The evidence clearly confirms this 
prediction with subjects saying that they had seen 
sentences like (13) 65.2% of the time, like (14) 
21.4% of the time, like (15) 7.2% of the time, and 
like (16) 6.3% of the time. An earlier memory 
model, HAM (Anderson & Bower, 1973) predicted total 
confusion in this situation rather than an inter- 
mediate level of confusion. In the recognition 
model for HAM there was no separate memory struc- 
ture to encode the referring expression. Rather 
the referent node was directly retrieved from mem- 
ory without the intermediate step of calculating 
a representation of the referring expression in 
memory. 
Recently Ortony and Anderson (1977) report 
a study which replicated and extended this result. 
They noted that some predicates seemed more appro- 
priate to a proper name and other predicates seemed 
more appropriate to a definite description. Con- 
sider their examples: 
(17) The first man on the moon became a nation- 
al hero. 
(18) Nell Armstrong has several children. 
(19) The first man on the moon has several 
children. 
(20) Nell Armstrong became a national hero. 
Ortony and Anderson point out that the uses in 
(17) and (18) are somewhat more natural than the 
uses in (19) and (20). Correspondingly, they 
found subjects made fewer errors in remembering 
what the referring expression had been for senten- 
ces like (17) and (18) than for sentences like 
(19) and (20). The error rates were 19.6% versus 
30.7%. Note, however, that in both cases subjects 
identified the original referring expression better 
than chance (50%). 
The Ortony and Anderson result would be 
expected under the current theory. To the extent 
that the predicate fits the referring expression 
subjects might attach it to the new node (e.g., 
node Y in Figure 5) which has the referring ex- 
pression attached to it. As Ortony and Anderson 
noted, the HAM theory had no way to explain this 
affinity between certain referring expressions and 
certain predicates. To explain the Ortony and An- 
derson results in the HAM framework we had to 
attribute them to a response bias. 
In the current ACT theory we can explain 
this result in terms of the frequency with which 
subjects chose Part (c) versus Part (e) of Figure 
6. The claim is that subjects use representations 
like Part (e) more frequently when the referring 
expression is appropriate. This is because it is 
easier to elaborate on the connection between the 
referring expression and the predicate. 
55 
Opaque and Transparent_References 
This analysis of reference has a natural ex- 
tension to analyzing the difference between opaque 
and transparent reference. For instance, contrast: 
(21) I am looking for the best lawyer in 
town. 
(22) I am looking for my little old mother. 
While both (21) and (22) might be considered am- 
biguous, the more apparent interpretation of (21) 
is that I am looking for someone who fits the des- 
cription "the best lawyer in town" and that I do 
not have a particular person in mind. In contrast, 
the more apparent interpretation of (22) is that I 
do have a particular person in mind. The former is 
an instance of opaque reference and the latter is 
an instance of transparent reference. Our discus- 
sion has so far focused on transparent reference. 
To correctly remember an instance of opaque refer- 
ence it is critical that it not be treated in the 
same manner as transparent reference. That is, 
even if the listener knows the reference of "the 
best lawyer in town", he should not use the node 
for this reference in representing the meaning of 
(21). Rather he should create a new node, attach 
the description to it, and put this node in the 
representation of (21). Figures 7a and 7b illus- 
trate the different representations appropriate 
for (21) and (22). In Part (a) there are two dis-

tinct nodes preserved to represent the best lawyer 
in town. One node (X_) has the prior facts known 
about the person while the second node (Y) stores 
information about the opaque reference in sentence 
(21). There is no such distinction in Part (b) of 
Figure 7 for the transparent case in (22). All 
information is attached to the original node X. 
So, the difference between transparent and opaque 
reference is whether the new information is copied 
to an existing node. 
Conclusions 
In concluding this paper I would llke to re- 
turn to Frege's morning star-evening star example. 
The discovery that the morning star was the even- 
ing star was an important scientific result. 
Frege used this fact to make clear the important 
distinction between sense and reference. The first 
half of this paper reported experiments where we 
basically recreated Frege's example and discovered 
that subjects dealt with that dilemna by the pro- 
cess of copying from one referring node to another. 
The argument in the second half of the paper was 
that Frege's examples are not isolated to discov- 
eries of science or to bizarre psychological ex- 
periments. Rather, every time we recognize a 
transparent referring expression we go through a 
discovery like that of the identity between the 
morning star and evening star. We create a node 
to represent the referent of the referring expres- 
sion and only then discover, with varying diffi- 
culty, that this node has the same reference as 
an established node in memory.
