Abstract
Hopper and Thompson (1980) defined a multi-axis
theory of transitivity that goes beyond simple syn-
tactic transitivity and captures how much ?action?
takes place in a sentence. Detecting these features
requires a deep understanding of lexical semantics
and real-world pragmatics. We propose two gen-
eral approaches for creating a corpus of sentences
labeled with respect to the Hopper-Thompson transi-
tivity schema using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Both
approaches assume no existing resources and incor-
porate all necessary annotation into a single system;
this is done to allow for future generalization to other
languages. The first task attempts to use language-
neutral videos to elicit human-composed sentences
with specified transitivity attributes. The second task
uses an iterative process to first label the actors and
objects in sentences and then annotate the sentences?
transitivity. We examine the success of these tech-
niques and perform a preliminary classification of
the transitivity of held-out data.
Hopper and Thompson (1980) created a multi-axis the-
ory of Transitivity1 that describes the volition of the sub-
ject, the affectedness of the object, and the duration of the
action. In short, this theory goes beyond the simple gram-
matical notion of transitivity (whether verbs take objects
? transitive ? or not ? intransitive) and captures how
much ?action? takes place in a sentence. Such notions of
Transitivity are not apparent from surface features alone;
identical syntactic constructions can have vastly different
Transitivity. This well-established linguistic theory, how-
ever, is not useful for real-world applications without a
Transitivity-annotated corpus.
Given such a substantive corpus, conventional machine
learning techniques could help determine the Transitivity
of verbs within sentences. Transitivity has been found to
play a role in what is called ?syntactic framing,? which
expresses implicit sentiment (Greene and Resnik, 2009).
1We use capital ?T? to differentiate from conventional syntactic tran-
sitivity throughout the paper.
In these contexts, the perspective or sentiment of the
writer is reflected in the constructions used to express
ideas. For example, a less Transitive construction might
be used to deflect responsibility (e.g. ?John was killed?
vs. ?Benjamin killed John?).
In the rest of this paper, we review the Hopper-
Thompson transitivity schema and propose two relatively
language-neutral methods to collect Transitivity ratings.
The first asks humans to generate sentences with de-
sired Transitivity characteristics. The second asks hu-
mans to rate sentences on dimensions from the Hopper-
Thompson schema. We then discuss the difficulties of
collecting such linguistically deep data and analyze the
available results. We then pilot an initial classifier on the
Hopper-Thompson dimensions.
1 Transitivity
Table 1 shows the subset of the Hopper-Thompson di-
mensions of Transitivity used in this study. We excluded
noun-specific aspects as we felt that these were well cov-
ered by existing natural language processing (NLP) ap-
proaches (e.g. whether the object / subject is person, ab-
stract entity, or abstract concept is handled well by exist-
ing named entity recognition systems) and also excluded
aspects which we felt had significant overlap with the
dimensions we were investigating (e.g. affirmation and
mode).
We also distinguished the original Hopper-Thompson
?Affectedness? aspect into separate ?Benefit? and
?Harm? components, as we suspect that these data will
be useful to other applications such as sentiment analy-
sis.
We believe that these dimensions of transitivity are
simple and intuitive enough that they can be understood
and labeled by the people on Amazon Mechanical Turk,
a web service. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) allows
individuals to post jobs on MTurk with a set fee that are
then performed by workers on the Internet. MTurk con-
nects workers to people with tasks and handles the coor-
dination problems of payment and transferring data.

Kinesis Sentences where movement happens are perceived to be more Transitive.?Sue jumped out of an airplane? vs. ?The corporation jumped to a silly conclusion.?
Punctuality Sentences where the action happens quickly are perceived to be more Transitive.?She touched her ID to the scanner to enter? vs. ?I was touched by how much she helped me.?
Mode Sentences with no doubt about whether the action happened are perceived to be more Transitive.?Bob was too busy to fix the drain? vs. ?Bob fixed the drain.?
Affectedness Sentences where the object is more affected by the action are perceived to be more Transitive.?The St. Bernard saved the climber? vs. ?Melanie looked at the model.?
Volition Sentences where the actor chose to perform the action are perceived to be more Transitive.?Paul jumped out of the bushes and startled his poor sister? vs. ?The picture startled George.?
Aspect Sentences where the action is done to completion are perceived to be more Transitive.?Walter is eating the hamburger? vs. ?Walter ate the pudding up.?
Table 1: The Hopper-Thompson dimensions of transitivity addressed in this paper. In experiments, ?Affectedness? was divided into
?Harm? and ?Benefit.?
2 Experiments
Our goal is to create experiments for MTurk that will pro-
duce a large set of sentences with known values of Tran-
sitivity. With both experiments, we design the tasks to
be as language independent as possible, thus not depend-
ing on language-specific preprocessing tools. This allows
the data collection approach to be replicated in other lan-
guages.
2.1 Elicitation
The first task is not corpus specific, and requires no
language-specific resources. We represent verbs using
videos (Ma and Cook, 2009). This also provides a form
of language independent sense disambiguation. We dis-
play videos illustrating verbs (Figure 1) and ask users on
MTurk to identify the action and give nouns that can do
the action and ? in a separate task ? the nouns that the
action can be done to. For quality control, Turkers must
match a previous Turker?s response for one of their an-
swers (a la the game show ?Family Feud?).
Figure 1: Stills from three videos depicting the verbs ?receive,?
?hear,? and ?help.?
We initially found that subjects had difficulty distin-
guishing what things could do the action (subjects) vs.
what things the action could be done to (objects). In or-
der to suggest the appropriate syntactic frame, we use
javascript to form their inputs into protosentences as they
typed. For example, if they identified an action as ?pick-
ing? and suggested ?fruit? as a possible object, the pro-
tosentence ?it is picking fruit? is displayed below their
input (Figure 2). This helped ensure consistent answers.
The subject and object tasks were done separately, and
for the object task, users were allowed to say that there
is nothing the action can be done to (for example, for an
intransitive verb).
Figure 2: A screenshot of a user completing a task to find ob-
jects of a particular verb, where the verb is represented by a
film. After the user has written a verb and a noun, a protosen-
tence is formed and shown to ensure that the user is using the
words in the appropriate roles.
These subjects and objects we collected were then used
as inputs for a second task. We showed workers videos
with potential subjects and objects and asked them to
create pairs of sentences with opposite Transitivity at-
tributes. For example, Write a sentence where the thing
to which the action is done benefits and Write a sentence
where the thing to which the action is done is not affected
by the action. For both sides of the Transitivity dimen-
sion, we allowed users to say that writing such a sentence
is impossible. We discuss the initial results of this task in
Section 3.
2.2 Annotation
Our second task?one of annotation?depends on having
a corpus available in the language of interest. For con-
189
creteness and availability, we use Wikipedia, a free mul-
tilingual encyclopedia. We extract a large pool of sen-
tences from Wikipedia containing verbs of interest. We
apply light preprocessing to remove long, unclear (e.g.
starting with a pronoun), or uniquely Wikipedian sen-
tences (e.g. very short sentences of the form ?See List
of Star Trek Characters?). We construct tasks, each for a
single verb, that ask users to identify the subject and ob-
ject for the verb in randomly selected sentences.2 Users
were prompted by an interactive javascript guide (Fig-
ure 3) that instructed them to click on the first word of the
subject (or object) and then to click on the last word that
made up the subject (or object). After they clicked, a text
box was automatically populated with their answer; this
decreased errors and made the tasks easier to finish. For
quality control, each HIT has a simple sentence where
subject and object were already determined by the au-
thors; the user must match the annotation on that sentence
for credit. We ended up rejecting less than one percent of
submitted hits.
Figure 3: A screenshot of the subject identification task. The
user has to click on the phrase that they believe is the subject.
Once objects and subjects have been identified, other
users rate the sentence?s Transitivity by answering the
following questions like, where $VERB represents the
verb of interest, $SUBJ is its subject and $OBJ is its ob-
ject3:
? Aspect. After reading this sentence, do you know
that $SUBJ is done $VERBing?
? Affirmation. From reading the sentence, how cer-
tain are you that $VERBing happened?
? Benefit. How much did $OBJ benefit?
? Harm. How much was $OBJ harmed?
? Kinesis. Did $SUBJ move?
? Punctuality. If you were to film $SUBJ?s act of
$VERBing in its entirety, how long would the movie
be?
? Volition. Did the $SUBJ make a conscious choice
to $VERB?
The answers were on a scale of 0 to 4 (higher num-
bers meant the sentence evinced more of the property in

dence between syntax and semantic roles precludes automatic labeling
of the subjects and objects.

surveys as a foundation.
question), and each point in the scale had a description to
anchor raters and to ensure consistent results.
2.3 Rewards
Table 2 summarizes the rewards for the tasks used in
these experiments. Rewards were set at the minimal rate
that could attract sufficient interest from users. For the
?Video Elicitation? task, where users wrote sentences
with specified Transitivity properties, we also offered
bonuses for clever, clear sentences. However, this was
our least popular task, and we struggled to attract users.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Creative but Unusable Elicitation Results
We initially thought that we would have difficulty coax-
ing users to provide full sentences. This turned out not
to be the case. We had no difficulty getting (very imag-
inative) sentences, but the sentences were often incon-
sistent with the Transitivity aspects we are interested in.
This shows both the difficulty of writing concise instruc-
tions for non-experts and the differences between every-
day meanings of words and their meaning in linguistic
contexts.
For example, the ?volitional? elicitation task asked
people to create sentences where the subject made a con-
scious decision to perform the action. In the cases where
we asked users to create sentences where the subject did
not make a conscious decision to perform an action, al-
most all of the sentences created by users focused on sen-
tences where a person (rather than employ other tactics
such as using a less individuated subject, e.g. replacing
?Bob? with ?freedom?) was performing the action and
was coerced into doing the action. For example:
? Sellers often give gifts to their clients when they are
trying to make up for a wrongdoing.
? A man is forced to search for his money.
? The man, after protesting profusely, picked an exer-
cise class to attend
? The vegetarian Sherpa had to eat the pepperoni pizza
or he would surely have died.
While these data are likely still interesting for other pur-
poses, their biased distribution is unlikely to be useful for
helping identify whether an arbitrary sentence in a text
expresses the volitional Transitivity attribute. The users
prefer to have an animate agent that is compelled to take
the action rather than create sentences where the action
happens accidentally or is undertaken by an abstract or
inanimate actor.
Similarly, for the aspect dimension, many users simply
chose to represent actions that had not been completed

using the future tense. For the kinesis task, users dis-
played amazing creativity in inventing situations where
movement was correlated with the action. Unfortunately,
as before, these data are not useful in generating predic-
tive features for capturing the properties of Transitivity.
We hope to improve experiments and instructions to
better align everyday intuitions with the linguistic proper-
ties of interest. While we have found that extensive direc-
tions tend to discourage users, perhaps there are ways in-
crementally building or modifying sentences that would
allow us to elicit sentences with the desired Transitivity
properties. This is discussed further in the conclusion,
Section 4.
3.2 Annotation Task
For the annotation task, we observed that users often had
a hard time keeping their focus on the words in question
and not incorporating additional knowledge. For exam-
ple, for each of the following sentences:
? Bonosus dealt with the eastern cities so harshly that
his severity was remembered centuries later .
? On the way there, however, Joe and Jake pick an-
other fight .
? The Black Sea was a significant naval theatre of
World War I and saw both naval and land battles
during World War II .
? Bush claimed that Zubaydah gave information that
lead to al Shibh ?s capture .
some users said that the objects in bold were greatly
harmed, suggesting that users felt even abstract concepts
could be harmed in these sentences. A rigorous inter-
pretation of the affectedness dimension would argue that
these abstract concepts were incapable of being harmed.
We suspect that the negative associations (severity, fight,
battles, capture) present in this sentence are causing users
to make connections to harm, thus creating these ratings.
Similarly, world knowledge flavored other questions,
such as kinesis, where users were able to understand from
context that the person doing the action probably moved
at some point near the time of the event, even if move-
ment wasn?t a part of the act of, for example, ?calling? or
?loving.?
3.3 Quantitative Results
For the annotation task, we were able to get consistent
ratings of transitivity. Table 3 shows the proportion of
sentences where two or more annotators agreed on the
a Transitivity label of the sentences for that dimension.
All of the dimensions were significantly better than ran-
dom chance agreement (0.52); the best was harm, which
has an accessible, clear, and intuitive definition, and the
worst was kinesis, which was more ambiguous and prone
to disagreement among raters.

code truthful statements, most actions have been com-
pleted, most objects are not affected, most events are over
a long time span, and there is a bimodal distribution over
volition. One surprising result is that for kinesis there
is a fairly flat distribution. One would expect a larger
skew toward non-kinetic words. Qualitative analysis of
the data suggest that raters used real-world knowledge to
associate motion with the context of actions (even if mo-
tion is not a part of the action), and that raters were less
confident about their answers, prompting more hedging
and a flat distribution.
3.4 Predicting Transitivity
We also performed an set of initial experiments to investi-
gate our ability to predict Transitivity values for held out
data. We extracted three sets of features from the sen-
tences: lexical features, syntactic features, and features
derived from WordNet (Miller, 1990).
Lexical Features A feature was created for each word
in a sentence after being stemmed using the Porter stem-
mer (Porter, 1980).
Syntactic Features We parsed each sentence using the
Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and used
heuristics to identify cases where the main verb is tran-
sitive, where the subject is a nominalization (e.g. ?run-
ning?), or whether the sentence is passive. If any of these
constructions appear in the sentence, we generate a corre-
sponding feature. These represent features identified by
Greene and Resnik (2009).
WordNet Features For each word in the sentence, we
extracted all the possible senses for each word. If any
possible sense was a hyponym (i.e. an instance of) one
of: artifact, living thing, abstract entity, location, or food,
we added a feature corresponding to that top level synset.
For example, the string ?Lincoln? could be an instance
of both a location (Lincoln, Nebraska) and a living thing
(Abe Lincoln), so a feature was added for both the loca-
tion and living thing senses. In addition to these noun-
based features, features were added for each of the pos-
sible verb frames allowed by each of a word?s possible
senses (Fellbaum, 1998).
At first, we performed simple 5-way classification and
found that we could not beat the most frequent class base-
line for any dimension. We then decided to simplify the
classification task to make binary predictions of low-vs-
high instead of fine gradations along the particular di-
mension. To do this, we took all the rated sentences for
each of the seven dimensions and divided the ratings into
low (ratings of 0-1) and high (ratings of 2-4) values for
that dimension. Table 4 shows the results for these bi-
nary classification experiments using different classifiers.
All of the classification experiments were conducted us-
ing the Weka machine learning toolkit (Hall et al, 2009)
and used 10-fold stratified cross validation.
Successfully rating Transitivity requires knowledge
beyond individual tokens. For example, consider kine-
sis. Judging kinesis requires lexical semantics to realize
whether a certain actor is capable of movement, pragmat-
ics to determine if the described situation permits move-
ment, and differentiating literal and figurative movement.
One source of real-world knowledge is WordNet;
adding some initial features from WordNet appears to
help aid some of these classifications. For example, clas-
sifiers trained on the volitionality data were not able to
do better than the most frequent class baseline before the
addition of WordNet-based features. This is a reasonable
result, as WordNet features help the algorithm generalize
which actors are capable of making decisions.

4 Conclusion
We began with the goal of capturing a subtle linguistic
property for which annotated datasets were not available.
We created a annotated dataset of 400 sentences taken
from the real-word dataset Wikipedia annotated for seven
different Transitivity properties. Users were able to give
consistent answers, and we collected results in a man-
ner that is relatively language independent. Once we ex-
pand and improve this data collection scheme for English,
we hope to perform similar data collection in other lan-
guages. We have available the translated versions of the
questions used in this study for Arabic and German.
Our elicitation task was not as successful as we had
hoped. We learned that while we could form tasks using
everyday language that we thought captured these sub-
tle linguistic properties, we also had many unspoken as-
sumptions that the creative workers on MTurk did not
necessarily share. As we articulated these assumptions
in increasingly long instruction sets to workers, the sheer
size of the instructions began to intimidate and scare off
workers.
While it seems unlikely we can strike a balance that
will give us the answers we want with the elegant instruc-
tions that workers need to feel comfortable for the tasks
as we currently defined them, we hope to modify the task
to embed further linguistic assumptions. For example, we
hope to pilot another version of the elicitation task where
workers modify an existing sentence to change one Tran-
sitivity dimension. Instead of reading and understanding
a plodding discussion of potentially irrelevant details, the
user can simply see a list of sentence versions that are not
allowed.
Our initial classification results suggest that we do not
yet have enough data to always detect these Transitiv-
ity dimensions from unlabeled text or that our algorithms
are using features that do not impart enough information.
It is also possible that using another corpus might yield
greater variation in Transitivity that would aid classifica-
tion; Wikipedia by design attempts to keep a neutral tone
and eschews the highly charged prose that would contain
a great deal of Transitivity.
Another possibility is that, instead of just the Transi-
tivity ratings alone, tweaks to the data collection process
could also help guide classification algorithms (Zaidan et
al., 2008). Thus, instead of clicking on a single annota-
tion label in our current data collection process, Turkers
would click on a data label and the word that most helped
them make a decision.
Our attempts to predict Transitivity are not exhaus-
tive, and there are a number of reasonable algorithms
and resources which could also be applied to the prob-
lem; for example, one might expect semantic role label-
ing or sense disambiguation to possibly aid the prediction
of Transitivity. Determining which techniques are effec-
tive and the reasons why they are effective would aid not
just in predicting Transitivity, which we believe to be an
interesting problem, but also in understanding Transitiv-
ity.
Using services like MTurk allows us to tighten the loop
between data collection, data annotation, and machine
learning and better understand difficult problems. We
hope to refine the data collection process to provide more
consistent results on useful sentences, build classifiers,
and extract features that are able to discover the Transi-
tivity of unlabeled text. We believe that our efforts will
help cast an interesting aspect of theoretical linguistics
into a more pragmatic setting and make it accessible for
use in more practical problems like sentiment analysis.
