Improved Language Modeling for English-Persian Statistical Machine 
Translation 
 
 
 
Abstract 
 
 As interaction between speakers of different 
languages continues to increase, the ever-
present problem of language barriers must be 
overcome. For the same reason, automatic 
language translation (Machine Translation) has 
become an attractive area of research and 
development. Statistical Machine Translation 
(SMT) has been used for translation between 
many language pairs, the results of which have 
shown considerable success. The focus of this 
research is on the English/Persian language pair. 
This paper investigates the development and 
evaluation of the performance of a statistical 
machine translation system by building a 
baseline system using subtitles from Persian 
films. We present an overview of previous 
related work in English/Persian machine 
translation, and examine the available corpora 
for this language pair. We finally show the 
results of the experiments of our system using 
an in-house corpus and compare the results we 
obtained when building a language model with 
different sized monolingual corpora. Different 
automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU, NIST 
and IBM-BLEU were used to evaluate the 
performance of the system on half of the corpus 
built. Finally, we look at future work by 
outlining ways of getting highly accurate 
translations as fast as possible. 
 
1    Introduction 
 
Over the 20th century, international interaction, 
travel and business relationships have increased 
enormously. With the entrance of the World 
Wide Web effectively connecting countries 
together over a giant network, this interaction 
reached a new peak. In the area of business and 
commerce, the vast majority of companies 
simply would not work without this global 
connection. However, with this vast global 
benefit comes a global problem: the language 
barrier. As the international connection barriers 
continually break down, the language barrier 
becomes a greater issue. The English language 
is now the world?s lingua franca, and non-
English speaking people are faced with the 
problem of communication, and limited access 
to resources in English.  
      Machine translation is the process of using 
computers for translation from one human 
language to another(Lopez, 2008). This is not a 
recent area of research and development. In fact, 
machine translation was one of the first 
applications of natural language processing, 
with research work dating back to the 
1950s(Cancedda, Dymetman, Foster, & Goutte, 
2009). However, due to the complexity and 
diversity of human language, automated 
translation is one of the hardest problems in 
computer science, and significantly successful 
results are uncommon. 
There are a number of different approaches to 
machine translation. Statistical Machine 
Translation (SMT) however, seems to be the 
preferred approach of many industrial and 
academic research laboratories (Schmidt, 2007). 
The advantages of SMT compared to rule-based 
approaches lie in their adaptability to different 
domains and languages: once a functional

system exists, all that has to be done in order to 
make it work with other language pairs or text 
domains is to train it on new data. 
      Research work on statistical machine 
translation systems began in the early 1990s. 
These systems, which are based on phrase-based 
approaches, operate using parallel corpora ? 
huge databases of corresponding sentences in 
two languages, and employ statistics and 
probability to learn by example which 
translation of a word or phrase is most likely 
correct. The translation moves directly from 
source language to target language with no 
intermediate transfer step. In recent years, such 
phrase-based MT approaches have become 
popular because they generally show better 
translation results. One major factor for this 
development is the growing availability of large 
monolingual and bilingual text corpora in recent 
years for a number of languages. 
      The focus of this paper is on statistical 
machine translation for the English/Persian 
language pair. The statistical approach has only 
been employed in several experimental 
translation attempts for this language pair, and 
is still largely undeveloped. This project is 
considered to be a challenge for several reasons. 
Firstly, the Persian language structure is very 
different in comparison to English; secondly, 
there has been little previous work done for this 
language pair; and thirdly, effective SMT 
systems rely on very large bilingual corpora, 
however these are not readily available for the 
English/Persian language pair.  
 
1.1 The Persian Language 
 
The Persian language, or Farsi as it is also 
known as, belongs to the Indo-European 
language family and is one of the more 
dominant languages in parts of the Middle East. 
It is in fact the most widely spoken language in 
the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian 
languages, being the official language of Iran 
(Persia) and also spoken in several countries 
including Iran, Tajikistan and Afghanistan. 
There also exist large groups and communities 
in Iraq, United Arab Emirates, People's 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, Bahrain, and 
Oman, not to mention communities in the USA.  
      Persian uses a script that is written from 
right to left. It has similarities with Arabic but 
has an extended alphabet and different words 
and/or pronunciations from Arabic.  
      During its long history, the language has 
been influenced by other languages such as 
Arabic, Turkish and even European languages 
such as English and French. Today?s Persian 
contains many words from these languages and 
in some cases words from other languages still 
follow the grammar of their original language 
particularly in building plural, singular or 
different verb forms. Because of the special and 
different nature of the Persian language 
compared to other languages like English, the 
design of SMT systems for Persian requires 
special considerations. 
 
1.2 Related Work 
 
Several MT systems have already been 
constructed for the English/Persian language 
pair.  
One such system is the Shiraz project, (Amtrup, 
Laboratory, & University, 2000). The Shiraz 
MT system is an MT prototype that translates 
text one way from Persian to English. The 
project began in 1997 and the final version was 
delivered in 1999.  
      The Shiraz corpus is a 10 MB manually-
constructed bilingually tagged Persian to 
English dictionary of about 50,000 words, 
developed using on-line material for testing 
purposes in a project at New Mexico State 
University. The system also comprises its own 
syntactic parser and morphological analyzer, 
and is focused on news stories material 
translation as its domain.  
Another English/Persian system was developed 
by (Saedi, Motazadi, & Shamsfard, 2009). This 
system, called PEnTrans, is a bidirectional text 
translator, comprising two main modules 
(PEnT1, and PEnT2) which translate in opposite 
directions (PEnT1 from English to Persian; 
PEnT2 from Persian to English). PEnT1 
employs a combination of both corpus based 
and extended dictionary approaches, and PEnT2 
uses a combination of rule, knowledge and 
corpus based approaches. PEnTrans introduced 
a new WSD method with a hybrid measure 
which evaluates different word senses in a 
76
sentence and scores them according to their 
condition in the sentence, together with the 
placement of other words in that sentence. 
      ParsTranslator is a machine translation 
system built to translate English to Persian text. 
It was first released for public use in mid-1997, 
the latest update being PTran version in April 
2004. The ParsTran input uses English text 
typed or from a file. The latest version is able to 
operate for over 1.5 million words and 
terminologies in English. It covers 33 fields of 
sciences, and is a growing translation service, 
with word banks being continually reviewed 
and updated, available at: 
http://www.ParsTranslator.Net/eng/index.htm. 
Another English to Persian MT system is the 
rule-based system developed by (Faili & 
Ghassem-Sani, 2005)This system was based on 
tree adjoining grammar (TAG), and later 
improved by implementing trained decision 
trees as a word sense disambiguation module. 
      Mohaghegh et al (2009) presented the first 
such attempt to construct a parallel corpus from 
BBC news stories. This corpus is intended to be 
an open corpus in which more text may be 
added as they are collected. This corpus was 
used to construct a prototype for the first 
statistical machine translation system. The 
problems encountered, especially with the 
process of alignment are discussed in this 
research (Mohaghegh & Sarrafzadeh, 2009). 
      Most of these systems have largely used a 
rule based approach, and their BLEU scores on 
a standard data set have not been published. 
Nowadays however, most large companies 
employ the statistical translation approach, 
using exceedingly large amounts of bilingual 
data (aligned sentences in two languages). A 
good example of this is perhaps the most well-
known Persian/English MT system: Google 
Translate recently released option for this 
language pair. Google?s MT system is based on 
the statistical approach, and was made available 
online as a BETA version in June 2009. 
     The Transonics Spoken Dialogue Translator 
is also partially a statistically based machine 
translation system. The complete system itself 
operates using a speech to text converter, 
statistical language translation, and subsequent 
text to speech conversion. The actual translation 
unit operates in two modes: in-domain and out-
of-domain. A classifier attempts to assign a 
concept to an utterance. If the object to be 
translated is within the translation domain, the 
system is capable of significantly accurate 
translations. Where the object is outside the 
translation domain, the SMT method is used. 
Transonics is a translation system for a specific 
domain (medical: doctor-to-patient interviews), 
and only deals with question/answer situations 
(Ettelaie, et al, 2005). 
      Another speech-to-speech English/Persian 
machine translation system is suggested by 
Xiang et al They present an unsupervised 
training technique to alleviate the problem of 
the lack of bilingual training data by taking 
advantage of available source language 
data(Xiang, Deng, & Gao, 2008).  
       However, there was no large parallel text 
corpus available at the time of development for 
both of these systems. For its specific domain, 
the Transonics translation system relied on a 
dictionary approach for translation, using a 
speech corpus, rather than a parallel text corpus. 
Their Statistical Translation approach was 
merely used as a backup system. 
 
2   Corpus Development for Persian 
 
A corpus is defined as a large compilation of 
written text or audible speech transcript. 
Corpora, both monolingual and bilingual, have 
been used in various applications in 
computational linguistics and machine 
translation. 
      A parallel corpus is effectively two corpora 
in two different languages comprising sentences 
and phrases accurately translated and aligned 
together phrase to phrase. When used in 
machine translation systems, parallel corpora 
must be of a very large size ? billions of 
sentences ? to be effective. It is for this reason 
that the Persian language poses some difficulty. 
There is an acute shortage of digitally stored 
linguistic material, and few parallel online 
documents, making the construction of a 
parallel Persian corpus is extremely difficult.  
      There are a few parallel Persian corpora that 
do exist. These vary in size, and in the domains 
they cover. One such corpus is FLDB1, which is 
a linguistic corpus consisting of approximately 
3 million words in ASCII format. This corpus 
77
was developed and released by (Assi, 1997) at 
the Institute for Humanities and Cultural 
Studies. This corpus version was updated in 
2005, in 1256 character code page, and named 
PLDB2. This new updated version contains 
more than 56 million words, and was 
constructed with contemporary literary books, 
articles, magazines, newspapers, laws and 
regulations, transcriptions of news, reports, and 
telephone speeches for lexicography purposes.  
      Several corpora construction efforts have 
been made based on online Hamshahri 
newspaper archives. These include Ghayoomi 
(2004), with 6 months of Hamshahri archives to 
yield a corpus of 6.5 million words, and 
(Darrudi, Hejazi, & Oroumchian, 2004), with 4 
years? worth of archives to yield a 37 million-
word corpus. 
      The ?Peykareh? or ?Text Corpus? is a corpus 
of 38 million words developed by Bijankhan et 
al. available at:  
http://ece.ut.ac.ir/dbrg/bijankhan/  and 
comprises newspapers, books, magazines 
articles, technical books, together with 
transcription of dialogs, monologues, and 
speeches for language modeling purposes. 
Shiraz corpus (Amtrup, et al, 2000)is a 
bilingual tagged corpus of about 3000 aligned 
Persian/English sentences also collected from 
the Hamshahri newspaper online archive and 
manually translated at New Mexico State 
University.  
      Another corpus, TEP (Tehran English-
Persian corpus), available at: 
http://ece.ut.ac.ir/NLP/ resources.htm , consists 
of 21,000 subtitle files obtained from 
www.opensubtitles.org. Subtitle pairs of 
multiple versions of same movie were extracted, 
a total of about 1,200(Itamar & Itai, 2008) then 
aligned the files using their proposed dynamic 
programming method. This method operates by 
using the timing information contained in 
subtitle files so as to align the text accurately. 
The end product yielded a parallel corpus of 
approximately 150,000 sentences which has 
4,100,000 tokens in Persian and 4,400,000 
tokens in English. 
Finally, European Language Resources 
Association (ELRA), available at: 
http://catalog.elra.info/product_info.php?produc
ts_id=1111, have constructed a corpus which 
consists of about 3,500,000 English and Persian 
words aligned at sentence level, to give 
approximately 100,000 sentences distributed 
over 50,021 entries. The corpus was originally 
constructed with SQL Server, but presented in 
access type file. The format for the files is 
Unicode. This corpus consists of several 
different domains, including art, culture, idioms, 
law, literature, medicine, poetry, politics, 
proverbs, religion, and science; it is available 
for sale online. 
 
3   Statistical Machine Translation 
  3.1   General  
 
Statistical machine translation (SMT) can be 
defined as the process of maximizing the 
probability of a sentence s in the source 
language matching a sentence t in the target 
language. In other words, ?given a sentence s in 
the source language, we seek the sentence t in 
the target language such that it maximizes P(t | 
s) which is called the conditional probability or 
the chance of t happening given s'' (Koehn, et al, 
2007).
 
     It is also referred to as the most likely 
translation. This can be more formally written 
as shown in equation (1). 
arg max P(t | s)        (1) 
     Using Bayes Rule from equation (2), we can 
write equation (1) for the most likely translation 
as shown in equation (3). 
 
    P (t | s) = P (t) * P(s | t) =P (s)                      
(2) 
 arg max P(t | s) = arg max P(t) * P(s | t)            
(3) 
 
     Where (t) is the target sentence, and (s) is the 
source sentence. P (t) is the target language 
model and P(s | t) is the translation model. The 
argmax operation is the search, which is done 
by a so-called decoder which is a part of a 
statistical machine translation system. 
 
   3.2   Statistical Machine Translation Tools 
 
There are a number of implementations of 
subtasks and algorithms in SMT and even 
software tools that can be used to set up a fully-
featured state-of-the-art SMT system. 
78
Moses (Koehn, et al, 2007) is an open-source 
statistical machine translation system which 
allows one to train translation models using 
GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2004).for any given 
language pair for which a parallel corpus exists. 
This tool was used to build the baseline system 
discussed in this paper. MOSES uses a beam 
search algorithm where the translated output 
sentence is generated left to right in form of 
hypotheses. Beam-search is an efficient search 
algorithm which quickly finds the highest 
probability translation among the exponential 
number of choices.  
      The search begins with an initial state where 
no foreign input words are translated and no 
English output words have been generated. New 
states are created by extending the English 
output with a phrasal translation of that covers 
some of the foreign input words not yet 
translated.  
The algorithm can be used for exhaustively 
searching through all possible translations when 
data gets very large. The search can be 
optimized by discarding hypotheses that cannot 
be part of the path to the best translation. 
Furthermore, by comparing states, one can 
define a beam of good hypotheses and prune out 
hypotheses that fall out of this beam (Dean & 
Ghemawat, 2008). 
 
3.3   Building a Baseline SMT System 
 
To build a good baseline system it is important 
to build a sentence aligned parallel corpus 
which is spell-checked and grammatically 
correct for both the source and target language. 
The alignment of words or phrases turns out to 
be the most difficult problem SMT faces. 
      Words and phrases in the source and target 
languages normally differ in where they are 
placed in a sentence. Words that appear on one 
language side may be dropped on the other. One 
English word may have as its counterpart a 
longer Persian phrase and vice versa. The 
accuracy of SMT relies heavily on the existence 
of large amounts of data which is commonly 
referred to as a parallel corpus. The first step 
taken was to develop the parallel corpus. This 
corpus is intended to be an open corpus in 
which more text can be added as they are 
collected. Sentences were aligned using 
Microsoft?s bi-lingual sentence aligner 
developed by (Moore, 2002). 
The next step we plan to take involves the 
construction of a statistical prototype based on 
the largest available English/Persian parallel 
corpus extracted from the domain of movie 
subtitles. This domain was chosen because the 
maximum number of words that can be 
displayed as a subtitle on the screen is between 
10- 12 which means both training and decoding 
will be a lot faster. Building a parallel corpus 
for any domain is generally the most time 
consuming process as it depends on the 
availability of parallel text. But the domain of 
subtitling makes it easier to get the source 
language in the form of scripts and the target 
language in the form of subtitles in many 
different languages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
Figure1. A typical SMT System 
 
      A language model (LM) is usually trained 
on large amounts of monolingual data in the 
target language to ensure the fluency of the 
language that the sentence is getting translated 
into. Language modeling is not only used in 
machine translation but also used in many 
natural language processing applications such as 
speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, 
parsing and information retrieval. A statistical 
language model assigns probabilities to a 
sequence of words and tries to capture the 
properties of a language. 
      The Language Model (LM) for this study 
was trained on the BBC Persian News corpus 
and also an in-house corpus from different 
genres. The SRILM toolkit developed was used 
79
to train a 5-gram LM for experimentation as in 
(Stolcke, 2002). 
 
4   Experiments and Results 
 
4.1   Experiment setup 
 
We used Moses a  phrase-based SMT 
development tool for constructing our machine 
translation system. This included  n-gram 
language models trained with the SRI language 
modeling tool, GIZA++ alignment tool, Moses 
decoder and the script to induce phrase-based 
translation models from word-based ones.  
 
4.2   Performance evaluation metrics 
 
A lot of research has been done in the field of 
automatic machine translation evaluation. 
Human evaluations of machine translation are 
extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can 
take months to finish and involve human labor 
that cannot be reused which is the main idea 
behind the method of automatic machine 
translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, 
and language independent. 
      One of the most popular metrics is called 
BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) 
developed at IBM. The closer a MT is to a 
professional human translation, the better it is. 
This is the central idea behind the BLEU metric.  
 NIST is another automatic evaluation metric 
with the following primary differences 
compared to BLEU such as Text pre-processing, 
gentler length penalty, information-weighted N-
gram counts and selective use of N-grams (Li, 
Callison-Burch, Khudanpur, & Thornton, 
2009); (Li, Callison-Burch, Khudanpur, & 
Thornton, 2009). 
 
4.3     Discussion and analysis of the results 
 
      In this study, Moses was used to establish a 
baseline system. This system was trained and 
tested on three in-house corpora, the first 817 
sentences, the second 1011 sentences, and the 
third 2343 sentences. The data available was 
split into a training and test set. Microsoft?s 
bilingual sentence aligner (Moore, 2002) was 
used to align the corpus and training sets. 
Aligning was also performed manually to aid in 
the improvement of the results. As the corpus 
size increased, we performed various 
experiments such as increasing the language 
model in each instance. 
 
 
Table  1. Size of test set and train set (language 
Model) En: English, FA: Farsi 
 
 Evaluation results from these experiments are 
presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4. As expected, 
BLEU scores improved as the size of the corpus 
increased. The BLEU scores themselves were 
significantly low; however this was expected 
due to the small size of the corpus. We plan to 
update and increase the corpus size in the near 
future, which will undoubtedly yield more 
satisfactory results.

The first test was performed on a corpus of 817 
sentences in Persian and the same number for 
their aligned translation in English. In this 
instance, the training set used was 864 
sentences. Results of this translation were 
evaluated using three evaluation metrics 
(BLEU, NIST, and IBM-BLEU) An excerpt 
from the output of this first experiment is shown 
in figure2 (a). 
      The second test comprised of a 1011 
sentences corpus, with a 1066 sentence training 
set. As can be seen, the evaluation metric results 
improved. 
      The same experiment was repeated for a 
third time, this time with an even larger corpus 
of 2343 sentences, and a training set of 7005 
sentences. The result can be seen in table 4. The 
results obtained in this test were close to those 
in the previous test, apart from a small increase 
in BLEU scores. It must be noted that BLEU is 
only a tool to compare different MT systems. So 
an increase in BLEU scores may not necessarily 
mean an increase in the accuracy of translation.  
The performance of the baseline English-
Persian SMT system was evaluated by 
computing BLEU, IBM-BLEU-NIST (Li, et al, 
2009) scores from different automatic 
evaluation metrics against  different sizes of the 
sentence aligned corpus and different sizes of 
the training set . 
      Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results obtained 
using corpuses of 817, 1011, and 2343 
sentences respectively. The language model size 
was varied from 864 to 1066 and finally to 7005 
sentences. 
      Moreover as shown in table 3, using a 
corpus and language model of 1011 and 1066 in 
size respectively produces better results. This 
can clearly be noticed from graph in Figure 
2(b). 
  Finally, increasing the size of the corpus to 
2343 and language model constructed using 
7005 sentences produced the best translation 
results as shown in both Figure 2(c) and Table 
4. This data shows that an increased corpus size 
will yield an improved translation quality, but 
only as long as the size of the language model is 
proportional to the corpus size. Literature refers 
to the fact that the size of the corpus, although 
important, does not have as great an effect as 
corpus and language model in the domain of 
translation (Ma & Way, 2009). In the Persian 
language, some problems and difficulties arise 
due to natural language ambiguities, anaphora 
resolution, idioms and differences in the types 
and symbols used for punctuation. These issues 
had to be resolved before any attempt at SMT 
could be made. Needless to stress on the fact 
that the better the alignment the better the 
results of the translation.

Despite the fact that compared to other 
language pairs, the available parallel corpora 
for the English/Persian language pair is 
significantly smaller, the future of statistical 
machine translation for this language pair 
looks promising. We have been able to 
procure several very large bilingual corpora, 
which we intend to combine with the open 
corpus we used in the original tests. With the 
use of a much larger bilingual corpus, we 
expect to produce a significantly higher 
evaluation metric score. Our planned 
immediate future work will consist of 
combining these corpora together, 
addressing the task of corpus alignment, and 
continuing the use of a web crawler to obtain 
further bilingual text. 
 
6   Conclusion 
This paper presented an overview of some of 
the work in the area of English/Persian MT 
systems that has been done to date, and showed 
a set of experiments in which our SMT system 
was applied to the Persian language using a 
relatively small corpus. The first part of this 
work was to test how well our system translates 
from Persian to English when trained on the 
available corpora and to spot and try and resolve 
problems with the process and the output 
produced. According to the results we obtained, 
it was concluded that a corpus of much greater 
size would be required to produce satisfactory 
results. Our experience with the corpus of 
smaller size shows us that for a large corpus, 
there will be a significant amount of work 
required in aligning sentences.
