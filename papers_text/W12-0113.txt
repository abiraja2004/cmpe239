Abstract 
The processing of parallel corpus plays 
very crucial role for improving the over-
all performance in Phrase Based Statisti-
cal Machine Translation systems (PB-
SMT). In this paper the automatic align-
ments   of different kind of chunks have 
been studied that boosts up the word 
alignment as well as the machine transla-
tion quality. Single-tokenization of 
Noun-noun MWEs, phrasal preposition 
(source side only) and reduplicated 
phrases (target side only) and the align-
ment of named entities and complex 
predicates provide the best SMT model 
for bootstrapping. Automatic bootstrap-
ping on the alignment of various chunks 
makes significant gains over the previous 
best English-Bengali PB-SMT system. 
The source chunks are translated into the 
target language using the PB-SMT sys-
tem and the translated chunks are com-
pared with the original target chunk. The 
aligned chunks increase the size of the 
parallel corpus. The processes are run in 
a bootstrapping manner until all the 
source chunks have been aligned with the 
target chunks or no new chunk alignment 
is identified by the bootstrapping process. 
The proposed system achieves significant 
improvements (2.25 BLEU over the best 
System and 8.63 BLEU points absolute 
over the baseline system, 98.74% relative 
improvement over the baseline system) 
on an English- Bengali translation task.  
1 Introduction 
The objective of the present research work is to 
analyze effects of chunk alignment in English ? 
Bengali parallel corpus in a Phrase Based Statis-
tical Machine Translation system. The initial sen-
tence level aligned English-Bengali corpus is 
cleaned and filtered using a semi-automatic 
process. More effective chunk level alignments 
are carried out by bootstrapping on the training 
corpus to the PB-SMT system. 
The objective in the present task is to align the 
chunks in a bootstrapping manner using a Single 
tokenized MWE aligned SMT model and then 
modifying the model by inserting the aligned 
chunks to the parallel corpus after  each iteration 
of the bootstrapping process, thereby enhancing 
the performance of the SMT system. In turn, this 
method deals with the many-to-many word 
alignments in the parallel corpus. Several types 
of MWEs like phrasal prepositions and Verb-
object combinations are automatically identified 
on the source side while named-entities and 
complex predicates are identified on both sides 
of the parallel corpus. In the target side only, 
identification of the Noun-noun MWEs and re-
duplicated phrases are carried out. Simple rule-
based and statistical approaches have been used 
to identify these MWEs. The parallel corpus is 
modified by considering the MWEs as single 
tokens. Source and target language NEs are 
aligned using a statistical transliteration tech-
nique. These automatically aligned NEs and 
Complex predicates are treated as translation ex-
amples, i.e., as additional entries in the phrase 
table (Pal.et al2010, 2011). Using this aug-
mented phrase table each individual source 
chunk is translated into the target chunk and then 
validated with the target chunks on the target 
side. The validated source-target chunks are con-
93
sidered as further parallel examples, which in 
effect are instances of atomic translation pairs to 
the parallel corpus. This is a well-known practice 
in domain adaptation in SMT (Eck et al, 2004; 
Wu et al, 2008).  The preprocessing of the paral-
lel corpus results in improved MT quality in 
terms of automatic MT evaluation metrics. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 briefly elaborates the related 
work. The PB-SMT system is described in Sec-
tion 3. The resources used in the present work 
are described in Section 4. The various experi-
ments carried out and the corresponding evalua-
tion results have been reported in Section 5. The 
conclusions are drawn in Section 6 along with 
future work roadmap.  
2 Related work 
A multi lingual filtering algorithm generates bi-
lingual chunk alignment from Chinese-English 
parallel corpus (Zhou.et al 2004). The algorithm 
has  three steps, first, the most frequent bilingual 
chunks are extracted from the parallel corpus, 
second, a clustering algorithm has been used for 
combining chunks which are participating for 
alignment and finally one English chunk is gen-
erated corresponding to a Chinese chunk by ana-
lyzing the highest co-occurrences of English 
chunks. Bilingual knowledge can be extracted 
using chunk alignment (Zhou.et al 2004). The 
alignment strategies include the comparison of 
dependency relations between source and target 
sentences. The dependency related candidates are 
then compared with the bilingual dictionary and 
finally the chunk is aligned using the extracted 
dependency related words. Ma.et al (2007) sim-
plified the task of automatic word alignment as 
several consecutive words together correspond to 
a single word in the opposite language by using 
the word aligner itself, i.e., by bootstrapping on 
its output. Zhu and Chang (2008) extracted a dic-
tionary from the aligned corpus, used the dic-
tionary to re-align the corpus and then extracted 
the new dictionary from the new alignment re-
sult. The process goes on until the threshold is 
reached.  
An automatic extraction of bilingual MWEs is 
carried out by Ren et al (2009), using a log like-
lihood ratio based hierarchical reducing algo-
rithm to investigate the usefulness of bilingual 
MWEs in SMT by integrating bilingual MWEs 
into the Moses decoder (Koehn et al, 2007). The 
system has observed the highest improvement 
with an additional feature that identifies whether 
or not a bilingual phrase contains bilingual 
MWEs. This approach was generalized in Car-
puat and Diab (2010) where the binary feature is 
replaced by a count feature which is representing 
the number of MWEs in the source language 
phrase. 
MWEs on the source and the target sides 
should be both aligned in the parallel corpus and 
translated as a whole. However, in the state-of-
the-art PB-SMT systems, the constituents of an 
MWE are marked and aligned as parts of con-
secutive phrases, since PB-SMT (or any other 
approaches to SMT) does not generally treat 
MWEs as special tokens. Another problem with 
SMT systems is the wrong translation of some 
phrases. Sometimes some phrases are not found 
in the output sentence. Moreover, the source and 
target phrases are mostly many-to-many, particu-
larly so for the English?Bengali language pair.  
The main objective of the present work is to see 
whether prior automatic alignment of chunks can 
bring any improvement in the overall perform-
ance of the MT system.  
3 PB-SMT System Description 
The system follows three steps; the first step is 
prepared an SMT system with improved word 
alignment that produces a best SMT model for 
bootstrapping. And the second step is produced a 
chunk level parallel corpus by using the best 
SMT model. These chunk level parallel corpuses 
are added with the training corpus to generate the 
new SMT model in first iteration. And finally the 
whole process repeats to achieve better chunk 
level alignments as well as the better SMT 
model. 
3.1 SMT System with improved Word 
Alignment 
The initial English-Bengali parallel corpus is 
cleaned and filtered using a semi-automatic 
process.  Complex predicates are first extracted 
on both sides of the parallel corpus. The analysis 
and identification of various complex predicates 
like, compound verbs (Verb + Verb), conjunct 
verbs (Noun /Adjective/Adverb + Verb) and se-
rial verbs (Verb + Verb + Verb) in Bengali are 
done following the strategy in Das.et al (2010). 
 Named-Entities and complex predicates are 
aligned following a similar technique as reported 
in Pal.et al(2011). Reduplicated phrases do not 
occur very frequently in the English corpus; 
some of them (like correlatives, semantic redu-
plications) are not found in English (Chakraborty 
94
and Bandyopadhyay, 2010).  But reduplication 
plays a crucial role on the target Bengali side as 
they occur with high frequency. These redupli-
cated phrases are considered as a single-token so 
that they may map to a single word on the source 
side. Phrasal prepositions and verb object combi-
nations are also treated as single tokens. Once the 
compound verbs and the NEs are identified on 
both sides of the parallel corpus, they are assem-
bled into single tokens. When converting these 
MWEs into single tokens, the spaces are replaced 
with underscores (?_?). Since there are already 
some hyphenated words in the corpus, hyphena-
tion is not used for this purpose. Besides, the use 
of a special word separator (underscore in this 
case) facilitates the job of deciding which single-
token MWEs to be de-tokenized into its constitu-
ent words, before evaluation. 
3.1.1 MWE Identification on Source Side 
 The UCREL1 Semantic analysis System 
(USAS) developed by Lancaster University 
(Rayson.et al 2004) has been adopted for MWE 
identification.  The USAS is a software tool for 
the automatic semantic analysis of English spo-
ken and written data. Various types of Multi-
Word Units (MWU) that are identified by the 
USAS software include: verb-object combina-
tions (e.g. stubbed out), noun phrases (e.g. riding 
boots), proper names (e.g. United States of 
America), true idioms (e.g. living the life of Ri-
ley) etc. In English, Noun-Noun (NN) com-
pounds, i.e., noun phrases occur with high fre-
quency and high lexical and semantic variability 
(Tanaka.et al 2003). The USAS software has a 
reported precision value of 91%. 
3.1.2 MWE Identification on Target Side 
Compound nouns are identified on the target 
side. Compound nouns are nominal compounds 
where two or more nouns are combined to form a 
single phrase such as ?golf club? or ?computer 
science department? (Baldwin.et al 2010). Each 
element in a compound noun can function as a 
lexeme in independent of the other lexemes in 
different context. The system uses Point-wise 
Mutual Information (PMI), Log-likelihood Ratio 
(LLR) and Phi-coefficient, Co-occurrence meas-
urement and Significance function (Agarwal.et 
al, 2004) measures for identification of com-
pound nouns. Final evaluation has been carried 
out by combining the results of all the methods. 
A predefined cut-off score has been considered 
                                                        
1  http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ucrel 
and the candidates having scores above the 
threshold value have been considered as MWEs. 
The repetition of noun, pronoun, adjective and 
verb are generally classified as two categories: 
repetition at the (a) expression level and at the 
(b) contents or semantic level. In case of Bengali, 
The expression-level reduplication are classified 
into five fine-grained subcategories:  (i) Ono-
matopoeic expressions (khat khat, knock knock), 
(ii) Complete Reduplication (bara-bara, big big), 
(iii) Partial Reduplication (thakur-thukur, God), 
(iv) Semantic Reduplication (matha-mundu, 
head) and (v) Correlative Reduplication 
(maramari, fighting). 
For identifying reduplications, simple rules 
and morphological properties at lexical level 
have been used (Chakraborty and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2010). The Bengali monolingual dic-
tionary has been used for identification of seman-
tic reduplications.  
An NE and Complex Predicates parallel cor-
pus is created by extracting the source and the 
target (single token) NEs from the NE-tagged 
parallel corpus and aligning the NEs using the 
strategies as applied in (Pal.et al 2010, 2011).  
3.1.3 Verb Chunk / Complex Predicate 
Alignment 
Initially, it is assumed that all the members of the 
English verb chunk in an aligned sentence pair 
are aligned with the members of the Bengali 
complex predicates. Verb chunks are aligned 
using a statistical aligner. A pattern generator 
extracts patterns from the source and the target 
side based on the correct alignment list.  The root 
form of the main verb, auxiliary verb present in 
the verb chunk and the associated tense, aspect 
and modality information are extracted for the 
source side token. Similarly, root form of the 
Bengali verb and the associated vibhakti (inflec-
tion) are identified on the target side token. Simi-
lar patterns are extracted for each alignment in 
the doubtful alignment list.  
Each pattern alignment for the entries in the 
doubtful alignment list is checked with the pat-
terns identified in the correct alignment list. If 
both the source and the target side patterns for a 
doubtful alignment match with the source and the 
target side patterns of a correct alignment, then 
the doubtful alignment is considered as a correct 
one.  
The doubtful alignment list is checked again to 
look for a single doubtful alignment for a sen-
tence pair. Such doubtful alignments are consid-
ered as correct alignment. 
95
The above alignment list as well as NE 
aligned lists are added with the parallel corpus 
for creating the SMT model for chunk alignment. 
The system has reported 15.12 BLEU score for 
test corpus and 6.38 (73% relative) point im-
provement over the baseline system (Pal.et al 
2011). 
3.2 Automatic chunk alignment 
 
3.2.1 Source chunk extraction 
The source corpus is preprocessed after identify-
ing the MWEs using the UCREL tool and single 
tokenizing the extracted MWEs. The source sen-
tences of the parallel corpus have been parsed 
using Stanford POS tagger and then the chunks 
of the sentences are extracted using CRF chun-
ker2 The CRF chunker detects the chunk bounda-
ries of noun, verb, adjective, adverb and preposi-
tional chunks from the sentences. After detection 
of the individual chunks by the CRF chunker, the 
boundary of the prepositional phrase chunks are 
expanded by examining the series of  noun 
chunks separated by conjunctions such as 
'comma', 'and' etc. or a single noun chunk fol-
lowed by a preposition.  For each individual 
chunk, the head words are identified. A synony-
mous bag of words is generated for each head 
word. These bags of words produce more alter-
native chunks which are decoded using the best 
SMT based system (Section 3.1). Additional 
translated target chunks for a single source chunk 
are generated.

3.2.2 Target chunk extraction 
The target side of the parallel corpus is cleaned 
and parsed using the shallow parser developed by 
the consortia mode project ?Development of In-
dian Language to Indian Language Machine 
Translation (IL-ILMT) System Phase II? funded 
by Department of Information Technology, Gov-
ernment of India. The individual chunks are ex-
tracted from the parsed output. The individual 
chunk boundary is expanded if any noun chunk 
contains only single word and several noun 
chunks occur consecutively.  The content of the 
individual chunks are examined by checking 
their POS categories. At the time of boundary 
expansion, if the system detects other POS cate-
gory words except noun or conjunction then the 
expansion process stops immediately and new 
chunk boundary beginning is identified. The IL-
ILMT system generates the head word for each 
individual chunk. The chunks for each sentence 
are stored in a separate list. This list is used as a 
96
validation resource for validate the output of the 
statistical chunk aligner. 
3.2.3 Source-Target chunk Alignment 
The extracted source chunks are translated using 
the generated SMT model. The translated chunks 
as well as their alternatives are validated with the 
original target chunk. During validation check-
ing, if any match is found between the translated 
chunk and the target chunk then the source chunk 
is directly aligned with the original target chunk. 
Otherwise, the source chunk is ignored in the 
current iteration for any possible alignment. The 
source chunk will be considered in the next 
alignment. After the current iteration is com-
pleted, two lists are produced: a chunk level 
alignment list and an unaligned source chunk list. 
The produced alignment lists are added with the 
parallel corpus as the additional training corpus 
to produce new SMT model for the next iteration 
process. The next iteration process translates the 
source chunks that are in the unaligned list pro-
duced by the previous iteration. This process 
continues until the unaligned source chunk list is 
empty or no further alignment is identified.  
3.2.4 Source-Target chunk Validation 
The translated target chunks are validated with 
the original target list of the same sentence. The 
extracted noun, verb, adjective, adverb and 
prepositional chunks of the source side may not 
have a one to one correspondence with the target 
side except for the verb chunk. There is no con-
cept of prepositional chunks on the target side. 
Some time adjective or adverb chunks may be 
treated as noun chunk on the target side. So, 
chunk level validation for individual categories 
of chunks is not possible. Source side verb 
chunks are compared with the target side verb 
chunks while all the other chunks on the source 
side are compared with all the other chunks on 
the target side. Head words are extracted for each 
source chunk and the translated head words are 
actually compared on the target side taking into 
the consideration the synonymous target words. 
When the validation system returns positive, the 
source chunk is aligned with the identified origi-
nal target chunk.  
4 Tools and Resources used 
A sentence-aligned English-Bengali parallel cor-
pus containing 14,187 parallel sentences from the 
travel and tourism domain has been used in the 
present work. The corpus has been collected 
from the consortium-mode project ?Development 
of English to Indian Languages Machine Trans-
lation (EILMT) System Phase II3?. The Stanford 
Parser4, Stanford NER, CRF chunker5 and the 
Wordnet 3.06 have been used for identifying 
complex predicates in the source English side of 
the parallel corpus.  
The sentences on the target side (Bengali) are 
parsed and POS-tagged by using the tools ob-
tained from the consortium mode project ?De-
velopment of Indian Language to Indian Lan-
guage Machine Translation (IL-ILMT) System 
Phase II?. NEs in Bengali are identified using the 
NER system of Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay 
(2008).  
The effectiveness of the MWE-aligned and 
chunk aligned parallel corpus is demonstrated by 
using the standard log-linear PB-SMT model as 
our baseline system: GIZA++ implementation of 
IBM word alignment model 4, phrase-extraction 
heuristics described in (Koehn et al, 2003), 
minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) on a 
held-out development set, target language model 
trained using SRILM toolkit  (Stolcke, 2002) 
with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 
1995) and the Moses decoder (Koehn et al, 
2007). 
5 Experiments and Evaluation Results 
We have randomly identified 500 sentences each 
for the development set and the test set from the 
initial parallel corpus. The rest are considered as 
the training corpus. The training corpus was fil-
tered with the maximum allowable sentence 
length of 100 words and sentence length ratio of 
1:2 (either way). Finally the training corpus con-
tains 13,176 sentences. In addition to the target 
side of the parallel corpus, a monolingual Ben-
gali corpus containing 293,207 words from the 
tourism domain was used for the target language 
model. The experiments have been carried out 
with different n-gram settings for the language 
model and the maximum phrase length and found 
that a 4-gram language model and a maximum 
phrase length of 4 produce the optimum baseline 
result. The rest of the experiments have been car-
ried out using these settings.

The system continues with the various pre-
processing of the corpus. The hypothesis is that 
as more and more MWEs and chunks are identi-
fied and aligned properly, the system shows the 
improvement in the translation procedure. Table 
1 shows the MWE statistics of the parallel train-
ing corpus. It is observed from Table 1 that NEs 
occur with high frequency in both sides com-
pared to other types of MWEs. It suggests that 
prior alignment of the NEs and complex predi-
cates plays a role in improving the system per-
formance.

Single tokenization of NEs and MWEs of any 
length on both the sides followed by GIZA++ 
alignment has given a huge impetus to system 
performance (6.38 BLEU points absolute, 73% 
relative improvement over the baseline). In the 
source side, the system treats the phrasal preposi-
tions, verb-object combinations and noun-noun 
compounds as a single token. In the target side, 
single tokenization of reduplicated phrases and 
noun-noun compounds has been done followed 
by alignments using the GIZA++ tool. From the 
observation of Table 2, during first iteration there 
are 81821 chunks are identified from the source 
corpus and 14534 has been aligned by the sys-
tem. For iteration 2, there are 67287 source 
chunks are remaining to align. At the final itera-
tion almost 65% of the source chunks have been 
aligned.

The system performance improves when the 
alignment list of NEs and complex predicates as 
well as sentence level aligned chunk are incorpo-
rated in the baseline best system. It achieves the 
BLEU score of 17.37 after the final iteration. 
This is the best result obtained so far with respect 
to the baseline system (8.63 BLEU points abso-
lute, 98.74% relative improvement in Table 3). It 
may be observed from Table 3 that baseline 
Moses without any preprocessing of the dataset 
produces a BLEU score of 8.74.

Intrinsic evaluation of the chunk alignment 
could not be performed as gold-standard word 
alignment was not available. Thus, extrinsic 
evaluation was carried out on the MT quality 
using the well known automatic MT evaluation 
metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) and NIST 
(Doddington, 2002). Bengali is a morphologi-
cally rich language and has relatively free phrase 
order. Proper evaluation of the English-Bengali 
98
MT evaluation ideally requires multiple set of 
reference translations. Moreover, the training set 
was smaller in size.  
6. Conclusions and Future work 
A methodology has been presented in this paper  
to show how the simple yet effective preprocess-
ing of various types of MWEs and alignment of 
NEs, complex predicates and chunks can boost 
the performance of PB-SMT system on an Eng-
lish?Bengali translation task. The best system 
yields 8.63 BLEU points improvement over the 
baseline, a 98.74% relative increase.  A subset of 
the output from the best system has been com-
pared with that of the baseline system, and the 
output of the best system almost always looks 
better in terms of either lexical choice or word 
ordering. It is observed that only 28.5% of the 
test set NEs appear in the training set, yet prior 
automatic alignment of the NEs complex predi-
cates and chunk improves the translation quality. 
This suggests that not only the NE alignment 
quality in the phrase table but also the word 
alignment and phrase alignment quality improves 
significantly. At the same time, single-
tokenization of MWEs makes the dataset sparser, 
but improves the quality of MT output to some 
extent. Data-driven approaches to MT, specifi-
cally for scarce-resource language pairs for 
which very little parallel texts are available, 
should benefit from these preprocessing meth-
ods. Data sparseness is perhaps the reason why 
single-tokenization of NEs and compound verbs, 
both individually and in collaboration, did not 
add significantly to the scores. However, a sig-
nificantly large parallel corpus can take care of 
the data sparseness problem introduced by the 
single-tokenization of MWEs.
