Abstract
This contribution addresses generation of
natural language descriptions for human ac-
tions, behaviour and their relations with
other objects observed in video streams.
The work starts with implementation of
conventional image processing techniques
to extract high level features from video.
These features are converted into natural
language descriptions using context free
grammar. Although feature extraction pro-
cesses are erroneous at various levels, we
explore approaches to putting them to-
gether to produce a coherent description.
Evaluation is made by calculating ROUGE
scores between human annotated and ma-
chine generated descriptions. Further we
introduce a task based evaluation by human
subjects which provides qualitative evalua-
tion of generated descriptions.
1 Introduction
In recent years video has established its domi-
nance in communication and has become an in-
tegrated part of our everyday life ranging from
hand-held videos to broadcast news video (from
unstructured to highly structured). There is a need
for formalising video semantics to help users gain
useful and refined information relevant to their
demands and requirements. Human language is
a natural way of communication. Useful entities
extracted from videos and their inter-relations can
be presented by natural language in a syntactically
and semantically correct formulation.
While literature relating to object recognition
(Galleguillos and Belongie, 2010), human action
recognition (Torralba et al, 2008), and emotion
detection (Zheng et al, 2010) are moving towards
maturity, automatic description of visual scenes
is still in its infancy. Most studies in video re-
trieval have been based on keywords (Bolle et
al., 1998). An interesting extension to a key-
word based scheme is natural language textual de-
scription of video streams. They are more human
friendly. They can clarify context between key-
words by capturing their relations. Descriptions
can guide generation of video summaries by con-
verting a video to natural language. They can pro-
vide basis for creating a multimedia repository for
video analysis, retrieval and summarisation tasks.
Kojima et al (2002) presented a method for
describing human activities in videos based on
a concept hierarchy of actions. They described
head, hands and body movements using natural
language. For a traffic control application, Nagel
(2004) investigated automatic visual surveillance
systems where human behaviour was presented
by scenarios, consisting of predefined sequences
of events. The scenario was evaluated and auto-
matically translated into a text by analysing the
visual contents over time, and deciding on the
most suitable event. Lee et al (2008) introduced
a framework for semantic annotation of visual
events in three steps; image parsing, event infer-
ence and language generation. Instead of humans
and their specific activities, they focused on ob-
ject detection, their inter-relations and events that
were present in videos. Baiget et al (2007) per-
formed human identification and scene modelling
manually and focused on human behaviour de-
scription for crosswalk scenes. Yao et al (2010)
introduced their work on video to text descrip-
tion which is dependent on the significant amount
of annotated data, a requirement that is avoided
in this paper. Yang et al (2011) presented a
27
framework for static images to textual descrip-
tions where they contained to image with up to
two objects. In contrast, this paper presents a
work on video streams, handling not only objects
but also other features such as actions, age, gender
and emotions.
The study presented in this paper is concerned
with production of natural language description
for visual scenes in a time series using a bottom-
up approach. Initially high level features (HLFs)
are identified in video frames. They may be ?key-
words?, such as a particular object and its posi-
tion/moves, used for a semantic indexing task in
video retrieval. Spatial relations between HLFs
are important when explaining the semantics of
visual scene. Extracted HLFs are then presented
by syntactically and semantically correct expres-
sions using a template based approach. Image
processing techniques are far from perfect; there
can be many missing, misidentified and erro-
neously extracted HLFs. We present scenarios
to overcome these shortcomings and to generate
coherent natural descriptions. The approach is
evaluated using video segments drafted manually
from the TREC video dataset. ROUGE scores is
calculated between human annotated and machine
generated descriptions. A task based evaluation is
performed by human subjects, providing qualita-
tive evaluation of generated descriptions.
2 Dataset Creation
The dataset was manually created from a sub-
set of rushes and HLF extraction task videos in
2007/2008 TREC video evaluations (Over et al,
2007). It consists of 140 segments, with each seg-
ment containing one camera shot, spanning 10 to
30 seconds in length. There are 20 video segments
for each of the seven categories:
Action: Human can be seen performing some action
(e.g., sit, walk)
Closeup: Facial expressions/emotions can be seen
(e.g., happy, sad)
News: Anchor/reporter may be seen; particular scene
settings (e.g., weather board in the background)
Meeting: Multiple humans are seen interacting; pres-
ence of objects such as chairs and a table
Grouping: Multiple humans are seen but not in meet-
ing scenarios; chairs and table may not be present
Traffic: Vehicles (e.g., car, bus, truck) / traffic signals
are seen
Indoor/Outdoor: Scene settings are more obvious
than human activities (e.g., park scene, office)
13 human subjects individually annotated these
videos in one to seven short sentences. They are
referred to as hand annotations in the rest of this
paper.
3 Processing High Level Features
Identification of human face or body can prove
the presence of human in a video. The method
by Kuchi et al (2002) is adopted for face detec-
tion using colour and motion information. The
method works against variations in lightning con-
ditions, skin colours, backgrounds, face sizes and
orientations. When the background is close to the
skin colour, movement across successive frames
is tested to confirm the presence of a human face.
Facial features play an important role in identify-
ing age, gender and emotion information (Maglo-
giannis et al, 2009). Human emotion can be esti-
mated using eyes, lips and their measures (gradi-
ent, distance of eyelids or lips). The same set of
facial features and measures can be used to iden-
tify a human gender1.
To recognise human actions the approach based
on a star skeleton and a hidden Markov model
(HMM) is implemented (Chen et al, 2006). Com-
monly observed actions, such as ?walking?, ?run-
ning?, ?standing?, and ?sitting?, can be identified.
Human body is presented in the form of sticks to
generate features such as torso, arm length and an-
gle, leg angle and stride (Sundaresan et al, 2003).
Further Haar features are extracted and classifiers
are trained to identify non-human objects (Viola
and Jones, 2001). They include car, bus, motor-
bike, bicycle, building, tree, table, chair, cup, bot-
tle and TV-monitor. Scene settings ? indoor or
outdoor ? can be identified based on the edge
oriented histogram (EOH) and the colour oriented
histogram (COH) (Kim et al, 2010).
3.1 Performance of HLF Extraction
In the experiments, video frames were extracted
using ffmpeg2, sampled at 1 fps (frame per sec-
ond), resulting in 2520 frames in total. Most of

lection of free software and open source libraries. It can
record, convert and stream digital audio and video in nu-
merous formats. The default conversion rate is 25 fps. See

Table 1: Confusion tables for (a) human detection and
(b) gender identification. Columns show the ground
truth, and rows indicate the automatic recognition re-
sults. The human detection task is biased towards exis-
tence of human, while in the gender identification pres-
ence of male and female are roughly balanced.
HLFs required one frame to evaluate. Human ac-
tivities were shown in 45 videos and they were
sampled at 4 fps, yielding 3600 frames. Upon
several trials, we decided to use eight frames
(roughly two seconds) for human action recogni-
tion. Consequently tags were assigned for each
set of eight frames, totalling 450 sets of actions.
Table 1(a) presents a confusion matrix for hu-
man detection. It was a heavily biased dataset
where human(s) were present in 1890 out of 2520
frames. Of these 1890, misclassification occurred
on 95 occasions. On the other hand gender iden-
tification is not always an easy task even for hu-
mans. Table 1(b) shows a confusion matrix for
gender identification. Out of 1890 frames in
which human(s) were present, frontal faces were
shown in 1349 images. The total of 3555 humans
were present in 1890 frames (1168 frames con-
tained multiple humans), however the table shows
the results when at least one gender is correctly
identified. Female identification was often more
difficult due to make ups, variety of hair styles
and wearing hats, veils and scarfs.
Table 2 shows the human action recognition
performance tested with a set of 450 actions. It
was difficult to recognise ?sitting? actions, proba-
bly because HMMs were trained on postures of a
complete human body, while a complete posture
was often not available when a person was sit-
ting. ?Hand waving? and ?clapping? were related
to movements in upper body parts, and ?walking?
and ?running? were based on lower body move-
ments. In particular ?waving? appeared an easy
action to identify because of its significant moves
of upper body parts. Table 3 shows the confu-
sion for human emotion recognition. ?Serious?,
?happy? and ?sad? were most common emotions
in this dataset, in particular ?happy? emotion was
most correctly identified.
There were 15 videos where human or any

other moving HLF (e.g., car, bus) were absent.
Out of these 15 videos, 12 were related to outdoor
environments where trees, greenery, or buildings
were present. Three videos showed indoor set-
tings with objects such as chairs, tables and cups.
All frames from outdoor scenes were correctly
identified; for indoor scenes 80% of frames were
correct. Presence of multiple objects seems to
have caused negative impact on EOH and COH
features, hence resulted in some erroneous clas-
sifications. The recognition performances for
non-human objects were also evaluated with the
dataset. We found their average precision3 scores
ranging between 44.8 (table) and 77.8 (car).
3.2 Formalising Spatial Relations
To develop a grammar robust for describing hu-
man related scenes, there is a need for formalis-
ing spatial relations among multiple HLFs. Their
effective use leads to smooth description of visual
scenes. Spatial relations can be categorised into
static: relations between not moving objects;
dynamic: direction and path of moving objects;
inter-static and dynamic: relations between moving
and not moving objects.

29
Figure 1: Procedure for calculating the ?between? rela-
tion. Obj 1 and 2 are the two reference objects, while
Obj 3, 4 and 5 are the target objects.
Static relations can establish the scene settings
(e.g., ?chairs around a table? may imply an indoor
scene). Dynamic relations are used for finding ac-
tivities present in the video (e.g., ?a man is run-
ning with a dog?). Inter-static and dynamic rela-
tions are a mixture of stationary and non station-
ary objects; they explain semantics of the com-
plete scene (e.g., ?persons are sitting on the chairs
around the table? indicates a meeting scene).
Spatial relations are estimated using positions
of humans and other objects (or their bounding
boxes, to be more precise). Following relation-
ships can be recognised between two or three ob-
jects: ?in front of?, ?behind?, ?to the left?, ?to the
right?, ?beside?, ?at?, ?on?, ?in?, and ?between?.
Figure 1 illustrates steps for calculating the three-
place relationship ?between?. Schirra et al (1987)
explained the algorithm:
? Calculate the two tangents g1 and g2 between
the reference objects using their closed-rectangle
representation;
? If (1) both tangents cross the target or its rectan-
gle representation (see Obj 4 in the figure), or (2)
the target is totally enclosed by the tangents and
the references (Obj 3), the relationship ?between?
is true.
? If only one tangent intersects the subject (Obj 5),
the applicability depends on its penetration depth
in the area between the tangents, thus calculate:
max(a/(a+b), a/(a+c))
? Otherwise ?between? relation does not hold.
3.3 Predicates for Sentence Generation
Figure 2 presents a list of predicates to be used for
natural language generation. Some predicates are
derived by combining multiple HLFs extracted,
e.g., ?boy? may be inferred when a human is a
Human structure related

?male? and a ?child?. Apart from objects, only one
value can be selected from candidates at one time,
e.g., gender can be male or female, action can
be only one of those listed. Note that predicates
listed in Figure 2 are for describing single human
scenes; combination of these predicates may be
used if multiple humans are present.
4 Natural Language Generation
HLFs acquired by image processing require ab-
straction and fine tuning for generating syntacti-
cally and semantically sound natural language ex-
pressions. Firstly, a part of speech (POS) tag is
assigned to each HLF using NLTK4 POS tagger.
Further humans and objects need to be assigned
proper semantic roles. In this study, a human is
treated as a subject, performing a certain action.
Other HLFs are treated as objects, affected by hu-
man?s activities. These objects are usually helpful
for description of background and scene settings.
A template filling approach based on context
free grammar (CFG) is implemented for sentence
generation. A template is a pre-defined structure
with slots for user specified parameters. Each
template requires three parts for proper function-
ing: lexicons, template rules and grammar. Lex-
icon is a vocabulary containing HLFs extracted
from a video stream (Figure 3). Grammar assures
syntactical correctness of the sentence. Template
rules are defined for selection of proper lexicons

with well defined grammar.
4.1 Template Rules
Template rules are employed for the selection of
appropriate lexicons for sentence generation. Fol-
lowings are some template rules used in this work:
Base returns a pre-defined string (e.g., when no HLF
is detected)
If same as an if-then statement of programming lan-
guages, returning a result when the antecedent of
the rule is true
Select 1 same as a condition statement of program-
ming languages, returning a result when one of
antecedent conditions is true
Select n is used for returning a result while more than
one antecedent conditions is true
Concatenation appends the the result of one template
rule with the results of a second rule
Alternative is used for selecting the most specific
template when multiple templates can be used
Elaboration evaluates the value of a template slot
Figure 4 illustrates template rules selection pro-
cedure. This example assumes human presence
in the video. If-else statements are used for fit-
ting proper gender in the template. Human can
be performing only one action at a time referred
by Select 1. There can be multiple objects which
are either part of background or interacting with
humans. Objects are selected by Select n rule.
These values can be directly attained from HLFs
extraction step. Elaboration rule is used for
generating new words by joining multiple HLFs.
?Driving? is achieved by combing ?person is in-
side car? and ?car is moving?.
4.2 Grammar
Grammar is the body of rules that describe the
structure of expressions in any language. We
If (gender == male) then man else woman
Select 1 (Action == walk, run, wave, clap, sit, stand )
Select n (Object == car, chair, table, bike)
Elaboration (If ?the car is moving? and ?person is
inside the car?) then ?person is driving the car?
Figure 4: Template rules applied for creating a sen-
tence ?man is driving the car?.
make use of context free grammar (CFG) for the
sentence generation task. CFG based formulation
enables us to define a hierarchical presentation for
sentence generation; e.g., a description for multi-
ple humans is comprised of single human actions.
CFG is formalised by 4-tuple:
G = (T,N, S,R)
where T is set of terminals (lexicon) shown in
Figure 3, N is a set of non-terminals (usually POS
tags), S is a start symbol (one of non-terminals).
Finally R is rules / productions of the form X ?
?, where X is a non-terminal and ? is a se-
quence of terminals and non-terminals which may
be empty.
For implementing the templates, simpleNLG is
used (Gatt and Reiter, 2009). It also performs
some extra processing automatically: (1) the first
letter of each sentence is capitalised, (2) ?-ing? is
added to the end of a verb as the progressive as-
pect of the verb is desired, (3) all words are put
together in a grammatical form, (4) appropriate
white spaces are inserted between words, and (5)
a full stop is placed at the end of the sentence.
4.3 Hierarchical Sentence Generation
In this work we define a CFG based presenta-
tion for expressing activities by multiple humans.
Ryoo and Aggarwal (2009) used CFG for hierar-
chical presentation of human actions where com-
plex actions were composed of simpler actions.
In contrast we allow a scenario where there is no
interaction between humans, i.e., they perform in-
dividual actions without a particular relation ?
imagine a situation whereby three people are sit-
ting around a desk while one person is passing
behind them.
Figure 5 shows an example for sentence gen-
eration related to a single human. This mech-
anism is built with three blocks when only one
subject5 is present. The first block expresses a
5Non human subject is also allowed in the mechanism.
31
Figure 5: A scenario with a single human.
Figure 6: A scenario with two humans.
human subject with age, gender and emotion in-
formation. The second block contains a verb de-
scribing a human action, to explain the relation
between the first and the third blocks. Spatial re-
lation between the subject and other objects can
also be presented. The third block captures other
objects which may be either a part of background
or a target for subject?s action.
The approach is hierarchical in the sense that
we start with creating a single human grammar,
then build up to express interactions between two
or more than two humans as a combination of sin-
gle human activities. Figure 6 presents examples
involving two subjects. There can be three scenar-
ios; firstly two persons interact with each other to
generate some common single activity (e.g., ?hand
shake? scene). The second scenario involves two
related humans performing individual actions but
they do not create a single action (e.g., both per-
sons are walking together, sitting or standing). Fi-
nally two persons happen to be in the same scene
at the same time, but there is no particular relation
between them (e.g., one person walks, passing be-
hind the other person sitting on a chair). Figure 7
shows an example that involves an extension of a
Figure 7: A scenario with multiple humans.

single human scenario to more than two subjects.
Similarly to two-human scenarios, multiple sub-
jects can create a single action, separate actions,
or different actions altogether.
4.4 Application Scenarios
This section overviews different scenarios for ap-
plication of the sentence generation framework.
Figure 8 presents examples for template selec-
tion procedure. Although syntactically and se-
mantically correct sentences can be generated in
all scenes, immaturity of image processing would
cause some errors and missing information.
Missing HLFs. For example, action (?sitting?)
was not identified in Figure 8(b). Further, detec-
Figure 9: Image processing can be erroneous: (a) only
three cars are identified although there are many ve-
hicles prominent, (b) five persons (in red rectangles)
are detected although four are present; (c) one male
is identified correctly, other male is identified as ?fe-
male?; (d) detected emotion is ?smiling? though he
shows a serious face.

tion of food on the table might have led to more
semantic description of the scene (e.g., ?dinning
scene?). In 8(d), fourth human and actions by
two humans (?raising hands?) were not extracted.
Recognition of the road and many more vehicles
in Figure 9(a) could have produced more semantic
expression (e.g., ?heavy traffic scene?).
Non human subjects. Suppose a human is ab-
sent, or failed to be extracted, the scene is ex-
plained on the basis of objects. They are treated as
subjects for which sentences are generated. Fig-
ure 9(a) presents such a scenario; description gen-
erated was ?multiple cars are moving?.
Errors in HLF extraction. In Figure 9(c), one
person was found correctly but the other was er-
roneously identified as female. Description gen-
erated was ?a smiling adult man is present with
a woman?. Detected emotion was ?smile? in 9(d)
though real emotion was ?serious?. Description
generated was ?a man is smiling?.
5 Experiments
5.1 Machine Generated Annotation Samples
Figures 10 to 12 present machine generated an-
notation and two hand annotations for randomly
selected videos related to three categories from
dataset.
Face closeup (Figure 10). Main interest was
to find human gender and emotion information.
Machine generated description was able to cap-
ture human emotion and background information.
Hand annotations explained the sequence more,
e.g., dressing, identity of a person as policeman,
hair colour and windy outdoor scene settings.
Traffic scene (Figure 11). Humans were absent
in most of traffic video. Object detector was able
to identify most prominent objects (e.g., car, bus)

?20041101 110000 CCTV4 NEWS3 CHN? from the HLF extrac-
tion task. Machine annotation: Many cars are present; Cars are

also a bridge on the road. Hand annotation 2: There are many cars;
There is a fly-over; Some buses are running on the fly-over; There is
vehicle parapet; This is a traffic scene on a highway.

for description. Hand annotations produced fur-
ther details such as colours of car and other ob-
jects (e.g., flyover, bridge). This sequence was
also described as a highway.
Action scene (Figure 12). Main interest was
to find humans and their activities. Successful
recognition of man, woman and their actions (e.g.,
?sitting?, ?standing?) led to well phrased descrip-
tion. The bus and the car at the background were
also identified. In hand annotations dressing was
noted and location was reported as a park.
5.2 Evaluation with ROUGE
Difficulty in evaluating natural language descrip-
tions stems from the fact that it is not a simple
task to define the criteria. We adopted ROUGE,
widely used for evaluating automatic summarisa-
tion (Lin, 2004), to calculate the overlap between
machine generated and hand annotations. Table
4 shows the results where higher ROUGE score
indicates closer match between them.
In overall scores were not very high, demon-
strating the fact that humans have different ob-
servations and interests while watching the same
video. Descriptions were often subjective, de-

pendent on one?s perception and understanding,
that might have been affected by their educa-
tional and professional background, personal in-
terests and experiences. Nevertheless ROUGE
scores were not hopelessly low for machine gen-
erated descriptions; Closeup, Action and News
videos had higher scores because of presence of
humans with well defined actions and emotions.
Indoor/Outdoor videos show the poorest results
due to the limited capability of image processing
techniques.
5.3 Task Based Evaluation by Human
Similar to human in the loop evaluation (Nwogu
et al, 2011), a task based evaluation was per-
formed to make qualitative evaluation of the gen-
erated descriptions. Given a machine generated
description, human subjects were instructed to
find a corresponding video stream out of 10 can-
didate videos having the same theme (e.g., a de-
scription of a Closeup against 10 Closeup videos).
Once a choice was made, each subject was pro-
vided with the correct video stream and a ques-
tionnaire. The first question was how well the de-
scription explained the actual video, rating from
?explained completely?, ?satisfactorily?, ?fairly?,
?poorly?, or ?does not explain?. The second ques-
tion was concerned with the ranking of usefulness
for including various visual contents (e.g., human,
objects, their moves, their relations, background)
in the description.
Seven human subjects conducted this evalua-
tion searching a corresponding video for each of
ten machine generated descriptions. They did not
involve creation of the dataset, hence they saw
these videos for the first time. On average, they
were able to identify correct videos for 53%6 of
6It is interesting to note the correct identification rate
descriptions. They rated 68%, 48%, and 40% of
descriptions explained the actual video ?fairly?,
?satisfactorily?, and ?completely?. Because mul-
tiple videos might have very similar text descrip-
tions, it was worth testing meaningfulness of de-
scriptions for choosing the corresponding video.
Finally, usefulness of visual contents had mix re-
sults. For about 84% of descriptions, subjects
were able to identify videos based on information
related to humans, their actions, emotions and in-
teractions with other objects.
6 Conclusion
This paper explored the bottom up approach to
describing video contents in natural language.
The conversion from quantitative information to
qualitative predicates was suitable for conceptual
data manipulation and natural language genera-
tion. The outcome of the experiments indicates
that the natural language formalism makes it pos-
sible to generate fluent, rich descriptions, allow-
ing for detailed and refined expressions. Future
works include detection of groups, extension of
behavioural models, more complex interactions
among humans and other objects.
