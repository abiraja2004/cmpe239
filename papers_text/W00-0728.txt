1 In t roduct ion  
In Brill's (1994) groundbreaking work on parts- 
of-speech tagging, the starting point was to as- 
sign each word its most common tag. An ex- 
tension to this first step is to utilize the lexical 
context (i.e., words and punctuation) surround- 
ing the word. This approach could obviously be 
used for ordering tags into higher order units 
(referred to as chunks) using chunk :labels. 
This paper will investigate the performance 
of simply picking the most likely tag for a given 
context, under the condition that a larger con- 
text is allowed to override the most likely la- 
bel of a smaller context. The results could be 
extended by secondary error correction as in 
Brill's tagger, but this exercise is left to the 
reader to allow us to concentrate on the perfor- 
mance based on storing and retrieving the most 
likely examples only. 
More sophisticated methods may' use more 
than one stored context to determine the la- 
bel that best fits the current context (Van den 
Bosch and Daelemans, 1998; Zavrel and Daele- 
mans, 1997; Skousen, 1989, inter al.). The 
method of this paper uses only one context o 
determine the best label, but may decrease the 
size of the context until a full match is found. 
2 Out l ine  o f  the  procedure  
2.1 "Training" 
The training of this mechanism is to determine 
which patterns in the training set are the most 
likely. Only tag information is used. A filter to 
convert a tag with a context into a chunk-label 
is constructed as follows: 
0) Construct symmetric n-contexts from the 
training corpus. A 1-context is simply the most 
common chunk-label for each tag. A 3-context 
is the tag followed by the tag before and after 
it, i.e., \[to t-1 t+l\]:label. Similarly, a 5-context, 
(i.e., \[t-2 \[t-1 \[to \] t+l\] t+2\]: label (of to)), is 
represented \[to t-1 t+l t-2 t+2\]:label. Finally, a 
7-context is represented as \[to t-1 t+l t-2 t+2 
t-3 t+3\]:label. It was verified that results do not 
significantly improve using larger contexts than 
5-contexts. 
1) For each set of n-contexts, determine 
the most frequent label for each occurring n- 
context. For example, the tag CC most fre- 
quently has the label B-NP if the context is 
PRP CC RP. The most frequent label for CC 
without extra context is "0". 
2) To save some storage space, the most fre- 
quent label in an n-context is only added if it 
is different from its nearest lower order context. 
For example, the label B-NP can be added for 
a 3-context since PRP CC RP gives a different 
result from CC alone. 
2.2 Test ing  
Testing is done by constructing the maximum 
context for each tag, and look it up in the 
database of the most likely patterns. If the 
largest context cannot be found the context is 
diminished step-by-step. 
3) In the test phase we need to form the 
longest contexts used in training (e.g., 7- 
contexts). The first word to get a chunk label 
is 'Rockwell' (Rockwell International Corp. 's) 
and its corresponding 7-context (without its la- 
bel) is NNP = NNP = NNP = POS, where '=' 
is a tag for a blank line (i.e., no text tag) since 
this is the very first few words. 
4) The only rule for chunk-labeling is to look 
up the closest surviving n-context and output 
its label. Simply look up \[to t-1 t+l t-2 t+2 t-3 
t+3\] ... \[to\] in that order until the context is 
found. The \[to\] context alone produces a F~=i 
of 77.

3 Resu l ts  
The evaluation program shows that this simple 
procedure reaches its best result for 5-contexts 
(table 1) with 92.46% label accuracy and phrase 
correctness measured by FZ=i = 87.23. How- 
ever, the improvement from 3-contexts to 5- 
contexts is insignificant, as 3-contexts reached 
92.41% accuracy and F~=1=87.09. The results 
for 7-contexts is almost identical to 5-contexts 
(92.44% and FZ=1=87.21). This is taken as the 
limit performance due to the size of the training 
corpus. 
In a larger training corpus, the most common 
longer contexts are likely to be useful but in a 
small set the longer contexts may occur with 
very low frequencies making it hard to deter- 
mine if the label of such contexts is the best 
guess for unseen samples. 
These results are the best that could be ex- 
pected without generalization. In order to do 
better, the method has to generalize to unseen 
contexts, e.g., by using some notion of close 
matching contexts (instances), to be able to use 
longer context even when some of that context 
has not been previously recorded. In addition, 
the tag-structure could be productively utilized. 
The presented method has treated all labels as 
arbitrary, atomic and independent symbols. 
3.1 Computat iona l  complex i ty  
Using rule 2 from section 2.1, 45 patterns 'sur- 
vived' for 1-contexts, and 3225, 71022, 38541 
for 3-,5- and 7-contexts respectively, i.e., a total 
of 45, 3270, 74292, 109563 using all contexts up 
to and including 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-contexts. Each 
unique context can be retrieved in one logical 
step (i.e., a hash-table lookup). There are obvi- 
ously many patterns in the database - but the 
complexity of the task is limited to the number 
of look-ups necessary. 
There is a maximum of four hash-table look- 
ups for each tag (i.e., when the 7-, 5-, and 3- 
contexts does not exist in the database the most 
likely label of the current tag will be used). 
Good performance can be obtained within a 
maximum of 2 look-ups for each label (i.e., us- 
ing only 1- and 3-contexts) and the best results 
were obtained with a maximum of 3 look-ups 
per label. 
4 D iscuss ion  
The memory-based approach seemingly postu- 
lates innate tags in the processing machinery. 
The author has found very little discussion on 
how the tags are thought o correspond to real- 
ity, a fact that was also pointed out, not so long 
ago, by Palmeri (1998). However, a few papers 
aiming towards automatic 'label', 'feature' or 
'tag' creation are available (Miikkulainen and 
Dyer, 1991; Johansson, 1999). 
It is undeniable that, from a practical per- 
spective, it is possible to reach very high perfor- 
mance on tasks, such as tagging, that demand 
a choice from a known set of alternatives by 
estimating statistical properties (e.g., the most 
likely label) from a large enough training set. 
This makes the method extremely useful for 
quick development of tools, which can be used 
in practical applications uch as text retrieval 
and machine translation; but also in linguis- 
tic research; e.g., finding examples of specific 
grammatical constructions in large collections 
of data. 
A challenge for future research is how tags 
could be constructed automatically, and what 
kind of information would be necessary to de- 
tect the relevant ag dimensions for some lin- 
guistically motivated task. 
5 Conc lus ion  
It was shown that using context made it possible 
to improve performance of maximum likelihood 
prediction. It was suggested that the limit of 
performance for this method is implicitly given 
by the size of the training set, as this determines 
the significance of larger contexts, and increases 
the chance of finding a matching longer con- 
text. In smaller collections, large patterns are 
a) likely to occur at a low frequency with few 
competing labels and b) likely to not exist in 
the test set. A larger collection will increase 
the number of different contexts, as well as the 
significance of picking the best, most frequent, 
prediction from a set of (identical) competitors 
with different labels. 
The presented method oes not generalize be- 
yond what is recorded in the training set as the 
most likely alternative. However, it is expected 
to ? improve with the size of the training set, as 
this makes it feasible to use longer contexts, and 
? have a low computational complexity, as the 
137 
process is always limited to use a low' number of 
hash table look-ups (determined by the largest 
size of context). Training is limited to detecting 
the most likely outcome of each context (i.e., a 
sorting operation).
