During the past nine months, our language processing effort has focused on implementin g
a new NLP system called INLET. INLET relies heavily on the methodology developed for th e
preceding VOX system . The goal of this work is to produce an NLP shell that can be customized t o
a variety of tasks and domains .
INLET provides user-friendly graphics-oriented tools for knowledge addition an d
perusal, to support customization to a variety of domains and tasks . INLET is implemented in C
on Sun SPARCstations, in order to support faster analysis than Lisp-based systems and t o
provide a more widely usable end-product .
At the present time, the basic knowledge addition system is in place, includin g
vocabulary addition interfaces (e .g ., Figure 1), a dictionary book tool (Figure 2), a hierarch y
editor (Figure 3), and a grammar rule editor (Figure 4) . A new Conceptual Grammar has been
implemented for INLET, supporting concept hierarchies, a 'conceptual' dictionary, and othe r
knowledge types (such as lexical interrelationships) .
A conceptual analyzer, called the skimmer (Figure 5), has been implemented to provid e
robust top-down language analysis capabilities. The skimmer will augment a bottom-u p
analyzer currently under construction . A skimmer trace is shown in Figure 6 .
DESCRIPTION OF THE SKIMME R
The skimmer, implemented in 2 months time, is the only operational component of the
INLET analyzer (called LASS, for Language Analysis Support System) . Six major processes
comprise the skimmer, and are described in turn . The first process performs a pass throug h
the input message to replace all fixed phrases with their atomic representation . Fo r
example, the literal phrase "farabundo marti national liberation front" is replaced by a concep t
that represents that phrase . The second process, called the pre-processor, locates and parse s
specialized constructs in the text, such as proper names, number words, temporal and locativ e
phrases, as well as some domain-specific phrases dealing with perpetrators, physical, and
human targets . Phrases like "thirty-three", "Ricardo Alfonso Castellar", "three months ago" ,
"San Miguel department", and "member of the FMLN", are all detected and parsed by the pre -
processor. Next, a pass through the text detects key words and phrases . Words like
"attack", "murder", and "bomb", as well as phrases like "set fire to object", "bomb damage d
object" are located in the text . Incidents found in this pass are merged or segmented by th e
grouping process . Groups of sentences associated with a single incident are then examined by
the actor/object separation process to determine perpetrators and targets . The subsequen t
178
slot filling process further examines groups of sentences to fill remaining slots of the MUC 3
template . In order to assure self-consistency in a single template, a semantic trimming and
rejection process trims the templates prior to output . This last process is ad hoc, bu t
substitutes for our current lack of script-based processing .

A sample of the system's output for message 48 from TST2 is shown above . The system
did fairly well, successfully applying an apposition rule in slot 11, for example . However,
even though it found the appositive, it incorrectly assigned civilian type to the attorney general ,
due to an undiagnosed bug . The system often sloughs adjectives, e .g ., condensing "urban
guerrillas" to "guerrillas" in the perpetrator id slot . Even though the first sentence of message
48 says " . . .accused the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) of the crime", th e
skimmer failed to fill the organization slot. In this case, failure was due to lack of patterns fo r
accusations . Failure to find the instrument in " . . .was killed when a bomb placed by urba n
guerrillas on his vehicle exploded" is due to the absence of a pattern like "bomb placed by
actor"
. Rather, the system knew the pattern "bomb BE placed by actor" where the verb 'to be' i s
not optional .
