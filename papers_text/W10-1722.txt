Abstract
This paper describes the Cambridge Uni-
versity Engineering Department submis-
sion to the Fifth Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. We report results for
the French-English and Spanish-English
shared translation tasks in both directions.
The CUED system is based on HiFST, a
hierarchical phrase-based decoder imple-
mented using weighted finite-state trans-
ducers. In the French-English task, we
investigate the use of context-dependent
alignment models. We also show that
lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding is
an effective framework for multi-source
translation, leading to large gains in BLEU
score.
1 Introduction
This paper describes the Cambridge University
Engineering Department (CUED) system submis-
sion to the ACL 2010 Fifth Workshop on Statis-
tical Machine Translation (WMT10). Our trans-
lation system is HiFST (Iglesias et al, 2009a), a
hierarchical phrase-based decoder that generates
translation lattices directly. Decoding is guided
by a CYK parser based on a synchronous context-
free grammar induced from automatic word align-
ments (Chiang, 2007). The decoder is imple-
mented with Weighted Finite State Transducers
(WFSTs) using standard operations available in
the OpenFst libraries (Allauzen et al, 2007). The
use of WFSTs allows fast and efficient exploration
of a vast translation search space, avoiding search
errors in decoding. It also allows better integration
with other steps in our translation pipeline such as
5-gram language model (LM) rescoring and lattice
minimum Bayes-risk (LMBR) decoding.

We participated in the French-English and
Spanish-English translation shared tasks in each
translation direction. This paper describes the de-
velopment of these systems. Additionally, we re-
port multi-source translation experiments that lead
to very large gains in BLEU score.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2
describes each step in the development of our sys-
tem for submission, from pre-processing to post-
processing. Section 3 presents and discusses re-
sults and Section 4 describes an additional experi-
ment on multi-source translation.
2 System Development
We built three French-English and two Spanish-
English systems, trained on different portions of
the parallel data sets available for this shared task.
Statistics for the different parallel sets are sum-
marised in Tables 1 and 2. No additional parallel
data was used. As will be shown, the largest paral-
lel corpus gave the best results in French, but this
was not the case in Spanish.
2.1 Pre-processing

UTF8 token (e.g., replacing ?&amp? by ?&?) as
this interacts with tokenization. Data was then to-
kenized and lowercased, so mixed case is added as
post-processing.
2.2 Alignments
Parallel data was aligned using the MTTK toolkit
(Deng and Byrne, 2005). In the English-to-French
and English-to-Spanish directions, we trained
a word-to-phrase HMM model with maximum
phrase length of 2. In the French to English and
Spanish to English directions, we trained a word-
to-phrase HMM Model with a bigram translation
table and maximum phrase length of 4.
We also trained context-dependent alignment
models (Brunning et al, 2009) for the French-
English medium-size (B) dataset. The context of
a word is based on its part-of-speech and the part-
of-speech tags of the surrounding words. These
tags were obtained by applying the TnT Tagger
(Brants, 2000) for English and the TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1994) for French. Decision tree clus-
tering based on optimisation of the EM auxiliary
function was used to group contexts that trans-
late similarly. Unfortunately, time constraints pre-
vented us from training context-dependent models
for the larger (C) dataset.
2.3 Language Model
For each target language, we used the SRILM
Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to estimate separate 4-
gram LMs with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser
and Ney, 1995), for each of the corpora listed in
Tables 3, 4 and 5. The LM vocabulary was ad-
justed to the parallel data set used. The compo-
nent models of each language pair were then in-
terpolated to form a single LM for use in first-pass
translation decoding. For French-to-English trans-
lation, the interpolation weights were optimised
for perplexity on a development set.

The Spanish-English first pass LM was trained
directly on the NC+News portion of monolingual
data, as we did not find improvements by using
Europarl. The second pass rescoring LM used all
available data.
2.4 Grammar Extraction and Decoding
After unioning the Viterbi alignments, phrase-
based rules of up to five source words in length
were extracted, hierarchical rules with up to two
non-contiguous non-terminals in the source side
were then extracted applying the restrictions de-
scribed in (Chiang, 2007). For Spanish-English
and French-English tasks, we used a shallow-1
grammar where hierarchical rules are allowed to
be applied only once on top of phrase-based rules.
This has been shown to perform as well as a
fully hierarchical grammar for a Europarl Spanish-
English task (Iglesias et al, 2009b).
For translation, we used the HiFST de-
156
coder (Iglesias et al, 2009a). HiFST is a hierarchi-
cal decoder that builds target word lattices guided
by a probabilistic synchronous context-free gram-
mar. Assuming N to be the set of non-terminals
and T the set of terminals or words, then we can
define the grammar as a set R = {Rr} of rules
Rr : N ? ??r,?r? / pr, where N ? N; and
?, ? ? {N ? T}+.
HiFST translates in three steps. The first step
is a variant of the CYK algorithm (Chappelier and
Rajman, 1998), in which we apply hypothesis re-
combination without pruning. Only the source
language sentence is parsed using the correspond-
ing source-side context-free grammar with rules
N ? ?. Each cell in the CYK grid is specified
by a non-terminal symbol and position: (N,x, y),
spanning sx+y?1x on the source sentence s1...sJ .
For the second step, we use a recursive algo-
rithm to construct word lattices with all possi-
ble translations produced by the hierarchical rules.
Construction proceeds by traversing the CYK grid
along the back-pointers established in parsing. In
each cell (N,x, y) of the CYK grid, we build a
target language word lattice L(N,x, y) containing
every translation of sx+y?1x from every derivation
headed by N . For efficiency, this lattice can use
pointers to lattices on other cells of the grid.
In the third step, we apply the word-based LM
via standard WFST composition with failure tran-
sitions, and perform likelihood-based pruning (Al-
lauzen et al, 2007) based on the combined trans-
lation and LM scores.
As explained before, we are using shallow-1 hi-
erarchical grammars (de Gispert et al, 2010) in
our experiments for WMT2010. One very inter-
esting aspect is that HiFST is able to build ex-
act search spaces with this model, i.e. there is no
pruning in search that may lead to spurious under-
generation errors.
2.5 Parameter Optimisation
Minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003)
under the BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2001) opti-
mises the weights of the following decoder fea-
tures with respect to the newstest2008 develop-
ment set: target LM, number of usages of the
glue rule, word and rule insertion penalties, word
deletion scale factor, source-to-target and target-
to-source translation models, source-to-target and
target-to-source lexical models, and three binary
rule count features inspired by Bender et al (2007)
indicating whether a rule occurs once, twice, or
more than twice in the parallel training data.
2.6 Lattice Rescoring
One of the advantages of HiFST is direct gener-
ation of large translation lattices encoding many
alternative translation hypotheses. These first-pass
lattices are rescored with second-pass higher-order
LMs prior to LMBR.
2.6.1 5-gram LM Lattice Rescoring
We build sentence-specific, zero-cutoff stupid-
backoff (Brants et al, 2007) 5-gram LMs esti-
mated over approximately 6.2 billion words for
English, 2.3 billion words for French, and 1.4 bil-
lion words for Spanish. For the English-French
task, the second-pass LM training data is the same
monolingual data used for the first-pass LMs (as
summarised in Tables 3, 4). The Spanish second-
pass 5-gram LM includes an additional 1.4 billion
words of monolingual data from the Spanish Giga-
Word Second Edition (Mendonca et al, 2009) and
Europarl, which were not included in the first-pass
LM (see Table 5).
2.6.2 LMBR Decoding
Minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) decoding (Kumar
and Byrne, 2004) over the full evidence space
of the 5-gram rescored lattices was applied to
select the translation hypothesis that maximises
the conditional expected gain under the linearised
sentence-level BLEU score (Tromble et al, 2008;
Blackwood and Byrne, 2010). The unigram preci-
sion p and average recall ratio r were set as de-
scribed in Tromble et al (2008) using the new-
stest2008 development set.
2.7 Hypothesis Combination
Linearised lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding
(Tromble et al, 2008) can also be used as an ef-
fective framework for multiple lattice combination
(de Gispert et al, 2010). For the French-English
language pair, we used LMBR to combine transla-
tion lattices produced by systems trained on alter-
native data sets.
2.8 Post-processing
For both Spanish-English and French-English sys-
tems, the recasing procedure was performed with
the SRILM toolkit. For the Spanish-English sys-
tem, we created models from the GigaWord set
corresponding to each system output language.

For the French-English system, the English model
was trained using the monolingual News corpus
and the target side of the News-Commentary cor-
pus, whereas the French model was trained using
all available constrained French data.
English, Spanish and French outputs were also
detokenized before submission. In French, words
separated by apostrophes were joined.
3 Results and Discussion
French?English Language Pair
Results are reported in Table 6. We can see
that using more parallel data consistently improves
performance. In the French-to-English direction,
the system HiFST (B) improves over HiFST (A)
by +0.9 BLEU and HiFST (C) improves over
HiFST (B) by +1.1 BLEU on the newstest2009
development set prior to any rescoring. The
same trend can be observed in the English-to-
French direction (+0.6 BLEU and +0.8 BLEU im-
provement). The use of context dependent align-
ment models gives a small improvement in the
French-to-English direction: system (B)CD im-
proves by +0.3 BLEU over system (B) on new-
stest2009. In the English-to-French direction,
there is no improvement nor degradation in per-
formance. 5-gram and LMBR rescoring also give
consistent improvement throughout the datasets.
Finally, combination between the medium-size
system (B)CD and the full-size system (C) gives
further small gains in BLEU over LMBR on each
individual system.
Spanish?English Language Pair
Results are reported in Table 7. We report experi-
mental results on two systems. The HiFST(A) sys-
tem is built on the Europarl + News-Commentary
training set. Systems HiFST (B),(B2) and (B3)
use UN data in different ways. System (B) simply
uses all the data for the standard rule extraction
procedure. System HiFST (B2) includes UN data
to build alignment models and therefore reinforce
alignments obtained from smaller dataset (A), but
extracts rules only from dataset (A). HiFST (B3)
combines hierarchical phrases extracted for sys-
tem (A) with phrases extracted from system (B).
Unfortunately, these three larger data strategies
lead to degradation over using only the smaller
dataset (A). For this reason, our best systems only
use the Euparl + News-Commentary parallel data.
This is surprising given that additional data was
helpful for the French-English task. Solving this
issue is left for future work.
4 Multi-Source Translation Experiments
Multi-source translation (Och and Ney, 2001;
Schroeder et al, 2009) is possible whenever mul-
tiple translations of the source language input sen-
tence are available. The motivation for multi-
source translation is that some of the ambiguity
that must be resolved in translating between one
pair of languages may not be present in a differ-
ent pair. In the following experiments, multiple
LMBR is applied for the first time to the task of
multi-source translation.

Separate second-pass 5-gram rescored lattices
EFR and EES are generated for each test set sen-
tence using the French-to-English and Spanish-to-
English HiFST translation systems. The MBR hy-
pothesis space is formed as the union of these lat-
tices. In a similar manner to MBR decoding over
multiple k-best lists in de Gispert et al (2009),
the path posterior probability of each n-gram u re-
quired for linearised LMBR is computed as a lin-
ear interpolation of the posterior probabilities ac-
cording to each individual lattice so that p(u|E) =
?FR p(u|EFR) + ?ES p(u|EES), where p(u|E) is the
sum of the posterior probabilities of all paths con-
taining the n-gram u. The interpolation weights
?FR + ?ES = 1 are optimised for BLEU score on
the development set newstest2008.
The results of single-system and multi-source
LMBR decoding are shown in Table 8. The opti-
mised interpolation weights were ?FR = 0.55 and
?ES = 0.45. Single-system LMBR gives relatively
small gains on these test sets. Much larger gains
are obtained through multi-source MBR combina-
tion. Compared to the best of the single-system 5-
gram rescored lattices, the BLEU score improves
by +2.0 for newstest2008, +1.9 for newstest2009,
and +1.9 for newstest2010. For scoring with re-
spect to a single reference, these are very large
gains indeed.
5 Summary
We have described the CUED submission to
WMT10 using HiFST, a hierarchical phrase-based
translation system. Results are very competitive in
terms of automatic metric for both English-French
and English-Spanish tasks in both directions. In
the French-English task, we have seen that the UN
and Giga additional parallel data are helpful. It
is surprising that UN data did not help for the
Spanish-English language pair.
Future work includes investigating this issue,
developing detokenization tailored to each output
language and applying context dependent align-
ment models to larger parallel datasets.
