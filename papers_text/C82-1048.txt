The  purpose  of the  present  paper  i s  to show the  
use fu lness  of  (1) the computer  p rocess ing  of the 
man i fo ld  data  of lex icograph ic  works ;  and (2) the  
normal  and reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordances  
compi led  on the  bas i s  of d i f fe rent  texts .  
1. More  than  ten  years  have  passed  s ince  the Reverse -a lphabet i zed  
D ic t ionary  of the  Hungar ian  Language (see Papp  1969) was  pub l i shed  as  the 
f i r s t  mnajor document  of the computer  p rocess ing  of A Magyar  Nye lv  t~r te l -  
mez6  Sz6t~ra  (the Exp lanatory  D ic t ionary  of the Hungar ian  Language) .  In 
the  course  of th i s  work  qu i te  a lot of g rammat ica l l y  re levant  in fo rmat ion  
rendered  by the cca.  60 thousand ent ry  words  of the source  d ic t ionary  was  
reg is te red ,  e .g .  how many s tems the ent ry  word  cons is ts  of; whether  it 
has  an af f ix  and where  it i s ;  what  s ty le  it represents ,  what  e tymolog ica l  
exp lanat ion  it is  g iven ,  and main ly :  what impor tant  morpho log ica l  and 
(with verbs )  syntact i c  character i s t i cs  it has ,  wh ich  par t  of speech  it 
be longs  to, etc.  On the bas i s  of the coded morpho log ica l  features  the 
automat ic  synthes i s  of the  fo rms  of these  60 thousand Words  becomes  
d i rec t ly  poss ib le  and the automat ic  ana lys i s  of Hungar ian  texts  can  be 
car r ied  out ind i rec t ly .  (NB. it i s  a lways  the  synthes i s  that  the  process ing  
of d ic t ionar ies  makes  d i rec t ly  poss ib le ,  see ,  e .g .  Za l i zn jak ' s  outs tand ing

I am go ing to show a d i rec t  and concrete  potent ia l  fo r  app l i ca t ion  (1.__~1) 
and I a l so  w ish  to demonst ra te  what genera l  resu l t s  can  be ga ined  f rom

1.1.  S ince 1981 we have  been par t i c ipat ing  in the  rea l i za t ion  of the  
Hungar ian  par t  of the MULT ILEX programme e laborated  by the Vseso juzny j  
Cent r  Perevoda  (Moscow) .  In our  case  the immedia te  purpose  of  th i s  
p rogramme is  to make  it poss ib le  fo r  an exper t  w i thout  any knowledge  of 
Hungar ian  to look up cer ta in  techn ica l  te rms;  a fu r ther  s tep  requ i res  a

the  text ,  the  programme car r ies  out the  ana lys i s  ( removes  the  end ings  and

d ic t ionary  we are  cur rent ly  p repar ing .  Th is  is not a t r iv ia l  task  if one 
cons iders  that in the highly inf lect ive,  agglut inat ive Hungar ian  language an 
inf lectable word has not only one or  two (cf. Engl ish:  table - tab les ;  - 
read - read ing-  reads ,  etc. ) o r  even about ten (e. g. Lat in ,  Russ ian)  
parad igmat ic  fo rms,  but hundreds  of them.  In theory  it has  long been 
known and now it is  a lso shown by the reverse  a lphabet ized concordances  
that wil l  be spoken of la ter  that th is  unbel ievably  la rge  number  of fo rms 
cont ras t  with prepos i t ions  in our  ne ighbour ing  Indo-European languages .  
Thus ,  whereas  in Eng l i sh ,  Russ ian ,  German,  etc. cer ta in  grammat ica l  
e lements  a re  "comfor tab ly"  separated  by spaces ,  in the agglut inat ive 
Hungar ian  language they became,  so to say,  merged with the word s tem.  
It is  not the lack of a space  to denote them which causes  the pr inc ip le  
dif f iculty.  Being within a s ing le  word  fo rm they can undergo  d i f ferent  
changes  themse lves  and can a lso  cause  d i f ferent  changes  in the word  s tem 
i tse l f  depending on the grammat ica l  nature  of the lexeme and on vowel  
harmony,  etc. To so lve th is  pure ly  pract i ca l  task  a mass  of empi r i ca l  data 
is needed. It is  p rec i se ly  the reverse  a lphabet ized concordances  that 
fu rn ish  them,  but the data gained f rom d ic t ionar ies  a re  a lso  ind ispensab le .  
1. 2. It was  at a conference  in P rague  some years  ago that I gave an 
account  of the genera l  resu l t s  gained f rom the study of the mater ia l  
rendered  by the Hungar ian  d ic t ionary  ment ioned above. The mat ter  in 
quest ion is  that a la rge  group  of Hungar ian  nouns der ives  one of the i r  
impor tant  fo rms,  namely  the th i rd  person  possess i~ fo rm,  in a way that 
seems to be rhapsod ic ,  somet imes  inser t ing  a "j" e lement  and somet imes  
not: ablaka 'h i s /her  window'  - ~ 'h i s /her  apr ico t '  ; t t i re lme 
"h is /~er  pat ience '  - f i lmje  'h i s /her  f i lm ' ,  etc. Th is  possess~ve f-orm was 
reg is tered  with each entry  word,  so we had the oppor tun i ty  to -group  the 
tens  of thousands  of nouns  of our  d ic t ionary  f rom the great ly  vary ing  
TI -~T points of view, keeping in mind the main question of "with 3 - without 
3 Thus ,  the two examples  quoted above were  used  to i l l us t ra te  the 
point that the appearance  of the " j"  e lement  could not depend d i rect ly  on 
the f inal  consonant :  in the f i r s t  pa i r  of examples  both s tems ended in "k" 
and in the second in "m" ;  it could not even depend on the f inal consonant  
group,  because  in the second pa i r  of examples  ' " ' j "  - not " j " "  was  
preceded by " lm"  in both cases ;  bu~, of course ,  we never the less  had such 
a sor t ing  made.  The invest igat ion  of the ful l  noun stock of the d ic t ionary  in 
d i f ferent  combinat ions  led to  the fol lowing conc lus ion:  the seeming ly  
rhapsod ic  appearance  or  omiss ion  of " j "  can eas i ly  be explained if we 
suppose  that the Hungar ian  language as a natura l  code is s t ruc tured  in such  
a way that automat ic  ana lys i s  can be car r ied  out us ing  a min imal  vocabu lary .  
Concretely: if the non-possessive stem is typical and "well-formed" from 
the viewpoint of the whole vocabulary-, i~.e. if it has a frequently occurring 
end, the "j" element does not appear a f te r - i~nthe  possessive form; and 
the other way round: where the stem would not b~-e r.~ognized automatically 
because it has a rare ending and therefore the bare 'ra/e~' ending would be 
linked automatically with the stem, "j" emerges, so to say, ~..order to 
stop this and to emphasize the end of  the bare stem. Thus in the ~t  pair 
of examples quoted above "j" did not appear after the bare final "k" bemuse 
this is frequent for the end of stems in Hungarian; whereas "j" appeared 
after the "bad" "ck" group, which is not a typical stem end in Hungarian. 
Our second pair of examples is also subjected to the same rule, although in 
a s l ight ly  d i f ferent  way: the word  t f i re lme did not requ i re  " j"  because  a 
EMPIRICAL DATA AND AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS 303 
typ ica l  change  of the s tem of a p roduct ive  Hungar ian  su f f ix  i s  h idden in it 
(the bare  nominat ive  is  t f i re lem,  here  the s tem was  automat ica l l y  
emphas ized  by the t l i re le 'm~lm-  oppos i t ion) ,  whereas  f i lm j  _e requ i red  a 
spec ia l  denotat ion  of the s tem by " j " ,  there  be ing no X f i lem/ f i lm oppos i t ion ,  
It must  be added that  the behav iour  of su f f i xes  was  d iagnost i c  f rom our  
point  of v iew.  If the suff ix is p roduct ive ,  there  is no  "j" a f ter  it; if it is 
not  p roduct ive  o r  it is not  a nomina l  suff ix but e .g .  an  ad ject iva l  one  and  
is used  w i th  a noun on ly  occas iona l ly ,  the appearance  of "j" is more  or  
less  necessary .  It is "more  or  less"  so because  it represents  the 
l inguist ic man i fes ta t ion  of a regu lar i ty  that is p rac t i ca l l y  a statist ical one ;  
what  the severa l  examples  of instabi l i ty and  para l le l  fo rms  are  exp la ined  by  
is that the l inguist ic  inst inct is not a computer ,  it is not  a lways  poss ib le  
for  a who le  communi ty  to dec ide  unequ ivoca l ly  whether  a stern end  is 
f requent  o r  ra re ,  whether  a suff ix is p roduct ive  o r  not. F rom this point  of 
v iew the behav iour  of the d i f ferent  h i s to r i co -e tymolog ica l  s t ra ta  is 
character i s i t i c .  The  nearer  we  move towards  the younger  loanwords  the 
TI N more  f requent ly  "j" appears :  a loanword  often has  a wrong  , "a typ ica l "  
end. But,  of course ,  we  can  on ly  say  "more  f requent ly" ,  "in many  cases" ,  
etc. : e .g.  af ter  a g reat  number  of words  end ing  in the eas i ly  percept ib le  
-urn, -(t) -or had  been  bor rowed f rom Lat in,  they  gradua l ly  became "good" ,  
i.e. recogn izab le  and  so they  did not  necessar i l y  have  to take  the spec ia l  
s ign  ,\] . A s imi la r  phenomenon can  a lso  be observed  w i th  compound words .  
A root  word  hav ing  a "wrong"  end  requ i res  "j" - but if it is of ten used  as  
the second par t  of a compound,  it becomes  someth ing  like a suffix, *'we 
bare  got used  to it" at the ends  of cornpounds  and  this is why  the "j" wil l  
soo'ner d i sappear  f rom there .  Th is  is eas i ly  not i ceab le  even  on  the bas i s  of 
a s imp le  reverse  a lphabet i zed  list, as  the root  word  of ten hav ing  a 
morp!~.o logica l  code  w i th  H j,, s tands  in the first p lace  there  and  it is 
i r r lmediate ly  fo l lowed by the compounds  in wh ich  this root  word  is the 
second part ,  and  in roany  cases  its code  has  a l ready  no  "j". (NB.  when the 
cod ing  was  go ing  on  this regu lar i ty  was  not even  guessed  at, so this 
theoret i ca l  cons iderat ion  cou ld  not  have  in f luenced  the coders ,  in the case  
of root  words  they  were  compe l led  to take  over  the cor respond ing  code  of 
the source  d ic t ionary .  O f  course ,  no  one  cou ld  see  these  compounds  in one  
group  be fore  the pub l i ca t ion  of the reverse  a lphabet i zed  d ic t ionary! )  
A l l  this, however ,  was  noth ing  more  than  a p laus ib le  hypothes is  suppor ted  
by  ev idence  f rom the d ic t ionary .  Its rea l  conf i rmat ion  cou ld  be  ach ieved  by  
the s tudy  of texts. Reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordances  based  on  Hungar ian  
l inguist ic mater ia l  a f ford a very  good  oppor tun i ty  to do  this. 
2. For  the last coup le  of years  a number  of normal  and  reverse  
a lphabet i zed  concordances  have  been  made at the L.  Kossuth  Un ivers i ty  on  
the bas i s  of Eng l i sh ,  F rench ,  Swah i l i  and  main ly  Hungar ian  and  Russ ian  
texts. Re ly ing  upon  the n~ater ia l  rendered  by  the last two  languages ,  we  
are  go ing  to show what  k ind of empi r i ca l  data  can  be prov ided  for  the 
ana lys is .  P roper ly  made concordances  f rom texts in d i f ferent  natura l  
l anguages  have  features  of the i r  own.  Thus ,  it is c lear  that a normal  
Swah i l i  concordance  works  the o ther  way  round in the sense  that the 
mater ia l  is d iv ided  into d i f ferent  g roups  accord ing  to the grammat ica l  
ind ices;  that in a F rench  concordance  \[~ is not exped ient  to pr int  runn ing  
words  cons is t ing  of th ree  or  fewer  letters. These  techn ica l  deta i ls  wi l l  not  
be  d i scussed  here ,  we  or:ly note  thai in Hungar ian  concordances  ~he art ic le  
"a"  wh ich  mah=es  up  a co~nparat ive ly  h igh  percent  of runn ing  words  in the 
304 F. PAPP 
d i f fe rent  s ty l i s t i c  s t ra ta  has  been left  out of cons iderat ion .  
2.1.  Hav ing  made a reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordance  f rom Hungar ian  
newspaper  texts  cons is t ing  of approx imate ly  26 thousand runn ing  words  we 
can ar r ive  at the  fo l lowing conc lus ions .  Of the 64 phonemes  in 
contemporary  Hungar ian  on ly  49 ac tua l ly  occur  at the  ends  of words ,  hal f  
of a l l  the  word  ends  be ing  occup ied  by the f i r s t  f ive ot these  (the 
percentage  number  of  these  phonemes  and the i r  occur rence  at the  ends  of 
words  in our  mater ia l :  / t /  13, / k /  12, /n /  9, / s /  9, /a /  7). As  it wi l l  be 
proved  in the  next  sec t ion  - a compar i son  of th i s  wi th  Russ ian  data  - th i s  
d iv i s ion  shows  a s i tuat ion  very  s imi la r  to that  in Russ ian .  One shou ld  say  
the agg lu t inat ive  character  of Hungar ian  becomes  c lear  w i th in  th i s  f rom the 
quant i ta t ive  point  of v iew:  w i th in  the  d i f fe rent  f ina l  phonemes  la rge  b locks  
with the same long agg lu t inat ive  end ing  group  can be seen .  Thus ,  18 % of 
a l l  words  end ing  in / t /  a re  made up by those  end ing  in /e t /  (non-possess ive  
acc .  s ing .  ; verbs  3 rd  pets .  s ing . ) ,  10 % by those  end ing  in /~t /  (possess ive  
acc .  s ing . ,  non-possess ive  acc .  s ing . ,  verb .  verba l  p re f ix ) ,  etc.  ; the  end 
/k /  has  f ina l  g roups ,  somet imes  conta in ing  as  many  as  th ree  phonemes:  
/nak /  and /nek / ,  each  tak ing  up 11% (dat. /gen ,  verb  3 rd pers .  p lu ra l ) ;  
the  same can be observed  with the  end /n / :  (ban) - (ben) (32 % a l together  - 
iness iv )  and so on. A l l  th i s  suggests  that  morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  in 
Hungar ian  shou ld  be s ta r ted  at the  ends  of words :  much  use fu l  g rammat ica l  
in fo rmat ion  is  concent ra ted  there .  These  f ina l  c lus ters  of two, th ree  or  four  
phonemes ,  of course ,  a re  not complete ly  homogeneous ,  but the  number  of 
words  to be ana lysed  in another  way is  ins ign i f i cant .  Thus ,  e .g .  the  acc .  
s ing.  fo rms  end ing  in /o t /  make  up 3 % of those  end ing  in / t /  and there  
a re  only  two runn ing  words  among them in wh ich  th i s  i s  in the  fo rm of nora.  
s ing .  (the two occur rences  of the  lexeme ~11~) ;  o r  to ment ion  another  
example :  among the dozens  of occur rences  of the  f ina l  quadrup le t  /~nek /  
(3 rd pets .  poss .  dat /gen)  to be ana lysed  on the bas i s  of the  same pr inc ip le  
only  two runn ing  words  can  be found:  b~k~nek and vers ik~nek ,  used  as  the 
non-possess ive  dat /gen  of  the  lexemes  b~ke 'peace '  and vers ike  ' l i t t le  
verse '  
We have  a l ready  ment ioned  above that  the  f ina l  empi r i ca l  ev idence  fo r  our  
hypothes is  on the possess ive  / j /  was  prov ided  by these  reverse  a lphabet i zed  
concordances .  It was  found that  of a l l  the words  end ing  in /a /  11% ended in 
/ ja /  ma in ly  owing  to th i s  possess ive  fo rm,  whereas  the words  end ing  in / je /  
d id not make  up 3 % of those  end ing  in /e / :  both the contemporary  
Hungar ian  vocabu lary  and the  contemporary  texts  wi th  the i r  f requent  /a /  end 
and less  f requent  /e /  end wil l  sooner  requ i re  the spec ia l  denotat ion  of  the  
end of the  s tem with / j /  immedia te ly  be fore  the /a / .  Other  Hungar ian  texts  
p resented  a very  s imi la r  p ic ture  of the  d iv i s ion  of f ina l  phonemes ,  
espec ia l l y  concern ing  /a/-/e/ at the  ends  of words .  Thus ,  e .g .  there  was  
not a s ing le  noun wi th  the end ing  / je /  in th i s  possess ive  forn~ among the 
thousands  of nouns  of the  approx imate ly  20 000 runn ing  words  of "To ld i "  
(an epic poem wr i t ten  by J~nos  Arany  in the midd le  of  the  las t  century ) ;  it  
goes  wi thout  say ing  that  at the same t ime a number  of them took the 
end ings  /a / ,  / j a /  and /e /  in th i s  g rammat ica l  fo rm:  the var ious  possess ive  
fo rms  in the i r  sum tota l  p roved  to be even  more  product ive  than  the p lu ra l  
ones .  (By the way,  a l l  th i s  tes t i f i es  that  Hungar ian  texts  can  be cons idered  
to have  been "contemporary"  f rom th i s  point  of v iew s ince  at leas t  the  
midd le  of  the  las t  century .  ) 
EMPIRICAL DATA AND AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS 305 
Concern ing  ana lys i s  let  us  make  one more  essent ia l  remark  in connect ion  
with the  / ja /  ending.  Forms l ike barack ja  'h i s /her  apr i co t '  can a l ready  be 
wel l  d i f fe rent ia ted  in the '  nomina l  dec lens ion ,  but the  same / ja /  end ing  has  
c reated  a new homonymy at the  ends  of words :  the  3 rd person  s ingu lar  
fo rms  of  ve la r  verbs  take  the same end ing  in the i r  ob jec t ive  con jugat ion :  
e .g .  th i s  fo rm of the  verb  v~g ' to  cut '  i s  v~gja  'he /she  cuts  ( i t ) ' .  The  
pro~inence  of  the  / ja /  end ing  can  be exp la ined  by th i s  fact  as  we l l ,  wh ich  
at the  same t ime makes  our  ev idence  weaker :  in the  case  of pa la ta l  harmony 
there  is  another  end ing  (cf. n~z "to look a t ' :  n~zi  'he /she  looks  at (it)' and 
not the  expectab le  Xn~zje o r~meth ing  l ike th i s -~.  The  whole  morpho logy  of  
Hungar ian ,  however ,  is  dominated  by a par t i cu la r  feature :  namely  that  no 
d i f fe rence  i s  made between the par ts  of speech:  the  /m/  at the ends  of 
words  re fe rs  to the  f i r s t  person  of verbs ,  nouns ,  p ronouns ,  etc.  ; the /k /  
re fe rs  to some kind of  p lu ra l .  Th i s ,  of  course ,  makes  morpho log ica l  , 
ana lys i s  based  on the word end more  di f f icu l t :  how pract i ca l  it i s  to know 
that  in Russ ian  end ings  conta in ing  the e lement  /y /  (ye, ~:.x, Z_~_~, etc.  ) 
be long to an ad jec t ive ;  that  the  overwhe lming  major i ty  of verba l  word  ends  
(e._~', e t ,  em,  ete,  e tc . )  is  charater i s t i c  only  of verbs ,  etc.  (It i s  
in te res t ing  to note  that  Eng l i sh ,  a language with an ext remely  poor  sys tem 
of end ings  and hard ly  comparab le  with Hungar ian  f rom th i s  point  of v iew,  
shows  a s imi la r  ind i f fe rence  towards  par ts  of speech  and even grammat ica l  
mean ing :  it i s  on ly  the  s imp le  / s /  that  fo rms  the  pl.ural of nouns ,  the  3 rd 
person  s ingu lar  of verbs  and even the gen i t ive  of nouns ;  such  a po lysemy,  
of , course ,  could hard ly  be imag ined  in Hungar ian .  )
2. 2. Here are the five most frequent final phonemes of "Onegin" containing 
about 22 000 running words, the percentage number is indicated in 
brackets :  / j /  (10), / i /  (10\], /a /  (9), /o /  (8), /e /  (8); 45 % of the  runn ing  
words  end in one of t-hese phonemes .  Wi th in  the most  f requent  word  ends ,  
however ,  one can  f ind fewer  f ina l  pa i r s  (not to speak  of t r ip le ts  o r  
quadrup le ts ) ,  and what  i s  impor tant  is  that  if an end ing  can s t i l l  be 
brought  into prominence ,  it can  bear  many  var ious  and incoherent  funct ions .  
Thu~, e .g .  in th i s  mater ia l  the word  end /e j /  makes  up more  than  one 
f i f th of a l l  the  480 runn ing  words  end ing  in / j / .  Wi th in  the  l im i ts  of th i s  
mater ia l  the  fo l lowing propor t ions  have  been s ta ted  (100 = 480): 1. p ronouns  
l ike ej ,  se j ,  vse j  (48 %), 2. gos te j - type  gen i t ive  p lu ra l  (14 %), 3. pos ledne j  
- type ad jec t iva l  fo rms  (10 T0), 4. no~e j - type  gen i t ive  p lu ra l  (10 %), 5. 
l en ive j - type  comparat ive  fo rms  (8 %), and so on. The  remain ing  10 T0 are  
spread  over  a dozen funct ions  (par ts  of speech ,  g rammat ica l  cases ,  moods  
of verbs ,  etc,  ). It shou ld  be noted that  none of the  most  f requent  f ive 
types  enumerated  here  is  homogeneous  f rom the point  of v iew of 
g rammat ica l  ana lys i s ,  cf. espec ia l l y  the  1. and the 3. wi th the i r  
v l . . fv  grammat ica l  po lysemy.  Some of the  more  " fo r tunate  rr end ings  as  1j , may

empi r i ca l  data  y ie lded  by a reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordance  may be

2. 3. It was  qu i te  c lear ,  even in the  ear ly  s tages  of mechan ica l  t rans la t ion ,  
that  the  separab le  Hungar ian  verba l  p re f ixes  would present  a spec ia l  p rob lem 
for  the  ana lys i s .  (Thus ,  the  very  f i r s t  s tep  of the very  f i r s t  Hungar ian -  
Russ ian  MT-a lgory thm in word - f ind ing  was  the search  fo r  verba l  p re f ixes  
that  might  have  been separated ,  cf. Me l '~uk  1958, 231. ) Accord ing  to the  
306 F. PAPP 
tes t imony  of the concordances ,  this p rob lem is rare,  though it does  exist 
structural ly and cannot  be neglected. In the newspaper  concordance  
ment ioned  above,  not more  than 362 "separated"  verba l  pref ixes have  been  
found, hard ly  less than 1,5 % of all the runn ing  words .  Fur ther ,  there 
were  only five (m_.m~_, el, ki, tel, be) of about fifty possib le verba l  pref ixes 
that occured  separate ly  in three quar ters  of all these cases.  
Normal  concordances  also prov ide  r ich mater ia l  for p rob lems of word  
order  of separab le  verba l  prefixes, negat ion etc., i.e. the topicalization of 
Hungar ian  sentences.  (Topical izat ion is of the u tmost  impor tance  f rom the 
v iewpoint  of the analysis  of Hungar ian  sentences,  cf. \ ]~.Kiss 1981; at the 
same t ime this question, if t reated en masse ,  i.e. by us ing  a computer ,  
can  hard ly  be approached in a way  other  than the one ment ioned .  )
