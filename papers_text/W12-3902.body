Abstract
Recognition of Named Entities (NEs) is a dif-
ficult process in Indian languages like Hindi,
Telugu, etc., where sufficient gazetteers and
annotated corpora are not available compared
to English language. This paper details a novel
clustering and co-occurrence based approach
to map English NEs with their equivalent rep-
resentations from different languages recog-
nized in a language-independent way. We
have substituted the required language specific
resources by the richly structured multilin-
gual content of Wikipedia. The approach in-
cludes clustering of highly similar Wikipedia
articles. Then the NEs in an English article
are mapped with other language terms in in-
terlinked articles based on co-occurrence fre-
quencies. The cluster information and the
term co-occurrences are considered in ex-
tracting the NEs from non-English languages.
Hence, the English Wikipedia is used to boot-
strap the NEs for other languages. Through
this approach, we have availed the structured,
semi-structured and multilingual content of
the Wikipedia to a massive extent. Experi-
mental results suggest that the proposed ap-
proach yields promising results in rates of pre-
cision and recall.
1 Introduction
Named entity recognition (NER) is an important
subtask of information extraction that seeks to
locate and classify atomic elements in text into
predefined categories such as the names of persons,
organizations, locations, etc.
The state-of-art NER systems for English pro-
duce near-human performance. However, for
non-English languages the state-of-art NER systems
perform below par. And for languages that have a
lack of resources (e.g., Indian Languages) a NER
system with a near-human performance is a distant
future.
NER systems so far developed involved linguistic
grammar-based techniques as well as statistical
models. The grammar-based techniques require
linguistic expertise and requires strenuous efforts
to build a NER system for every new language.
Such techniques can be safely avoided when there
is a requirement to build a generic NER system
for several languages (e.g., Indian Languages).
Statistical NER systems typically require a large
amount of manually annotated training data. With
the serious lack of such manually annotated training
data, the task of high-performance NER system
projects as a major challenge for Indian languages.
This paper focuses on building a generic-purpose
NE identification system for Indian languages.
Given the constraints for resource-poor languages,
we restrain from developing a regular NE Recogni-
tion system. However, the goal here is to identify
as many NEs available in Indian languages without
using any language-dependent tools or resources.
Wikipedia is a free, web-based, collaborative,
multilingual encyclopedia. There are 283 language
editions available as of now. Wikipedia has both
structured (e.g., Infoboxes, Categories, Hyperlinks,
11
InterLanguage links, etc.) and semi-structured
(content and organization of the page) information.
Hence, the richly linked structure of Wikipedia
present across several languages (e.g., English,
Hindi, Marathi) has been used to build and enhance
many NLP applications including NE identification
systems. However, the existing approaches that
exploit Wikipedia for recognizing NEs concentrates
only on the structured parts which results in less
recall. Our approach concentrates on exploiting
structured and semi-structured parts of Wikipedia
and hence yielding better results.
The approach used is simple, efficient, easily
reproducible and can be extended to any language
as it doesn?t use any of the language specific
resources.
2 Related Work
Wikipedia has been the subject of a considerable
amount of research in recent years including
Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2005), Milne et
al. (2006), Zesch et al. (2007), Timothy Weale
(2006) and Richman and Schone (2008). The most
relevant work to this paper are Kazama and Tori-
sawa (2007), Toral and Munoz (2006), Cucerzan
(2007), Richman and Schone (2008). More details
follow, however it is worth noting that all known
prior research is fundamentally monolingual, often
developing algorithms that can be adapted to other
languages pending availability of the appropriate
semantic resources.
Toral and Munoz (2006) used Wikipedia to
create lists of NE?s. They used the first sentence
of Wikipedia articles as likely definitions of the
article titles, and used them in attempting to classify
the titles as people, locations, organizations, or
none. Unlike the method presented in our paper,
their algorithm relied on WordNet (or an equivalent
resource in another language). The authors noted
that their results would need to pass a manual
supervision step before being useful for the NER
task, and thus did not evaluate their results in the
context of a full NER system.
Similarly, Kazama and Torisawa (2007) used
Wikipedia, particularly the first sentence of each ar-
ticle, to create lists of entities. Rather than building
entity dictionaries, associating words and phrases
to the classical NE tags (PERSON, LOCATION,
etc.), they used a noun phrase following the verb
forms ?to be? to derive a label. For example, they
used the sentence ?Franz Fischler ... is an Austrian
politician? to associate the label ?politician? to the
surface form ?Franz Fischler?. They proceeded to
show that the dictionaries generated by their method
are useful when integrated into an NER system.
It is to be noted that their technique relies upon a
part-of-speech tagger.
Cucerzan (2007), by contrast to the above,
used Wikipedia primarily for Named Entity Dis-
ambiguation, following the path of Bunescu and
Pasca (2006). As in our paper, and unlike the above
mentioned works, Cucerzan (2007) made use of
the explicit Category information found within
Wikipedia. In particular, Category and related list
derived data were key pieces of information used
to differentiate between various meanings of an
ambiguous surface form. Cucerzan (2007) did not
make use of the Category information in identifying
the class of a given entity. It is to be noted that the
NER component was not the focus of their research,
and was specific to the English language.
Richman and Schone (2008) emphasized on
the use of links between articles of different lan-
guages, specifically between English (the largest
and best linked Wikipedia) and other languages.
The approach uses English Wikipedia structure
namely categories and hyperlinks to get NEs and
then use language specific tools to derive multilin-
gual NEs.
The following are the majors differences be-
tween any of the above approaches to the approach
followed in this paper.
? No language resource has been used at any
stage of NE identification, unlike the above ap-
proaches that used at least one of the language
dependent tools like dictionary, POS tagger,etc.
? Our approach utilized several aspects of
Wikipedia (e.g., InterLanguage links, Cate-
12
gories, Sub-titles, Article Text), which has been
by far the best exploitation of various structural
aspects of Wikipedia.
? Language-independent mapping of mul-
tilingual similar content (i.e., the paral-
lel/comparable topics or sentences of different
languages) can be used as a reference to any
future work. Further details can be found in
the Section 4.2.
3 Wikipedia Structure
From Wikipedia, we exploited the following three
major units:
Category links: These are the links from an
article to ?Category? pages, represented in the form
of [[Category:Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]],
[[Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania]], etc.
InterLanguage links: Links from an article
to a presumably equivalent article in another lan-
guage. For example, in the English language article
?History of India?, one finds a set of links including
[[hi: ]]. In almost all cases, the articles
linked in this manner represent articles on the same
subject.
Subtitles of the document: These are consid-
ered to be semi-structured parts of a Wikipedia
article. Every page in Wikipedia consists of a
title and subtitles. Considering the data below the
subtitles, they can be referred as subparts of the
article. For example, the article regarding Jimmy
Wales has subtitles ?Early life and education?,
?Career?, etc.
4 Architecture
The system architecture involves 3 main steps and
are detailed as follows:
4.1 Related Document Clustering:
Hierarchical clustering outputs a hierarchy, a struc-
ture that is more informative than the unstructured
set of clusters returned by flat clustering. This paper
deals with large amounts of semi-structured data
and requires structured clusters as output rather
than unstructured clusters. Moreover, specifying the
number of clusters beforehand is difficult. Hence,
we prefer Hierarchical clustering over Flat clus-
tering in rest of the paper. Bottom-up algorithms
can reach a cluster configuration with a better
homogeneity than Top-Down clustering. Hence,
we prefer bottom-up clustering over top-down
clustering.
Within bottom-up clustering there are several
similarity measures that can be employed namely
single-linkage, complete-linkage, group-average
and centroid-measure. This single-link merge
criterion is local. Priority is given solely to the area
where the two clusters come closest to each other.
Other, more distant parts of the cluster and the
clusters? overall structure are not taken into account.
In complete-link clustering or complete-linkage
clustering, the similarity of two clusters is the
similarity of their most dissimilar members. In
centroid clustering, the similarity of two clusters
is defined as the similarity of their centroids.
Group-average agglomerative clustering or GAAC
evaluates cluster quality based on all similarities
between documents, thus avoiding the pitfalls of
the single-link and complete-link criteria. Hence,
in this paper, we made use of the Group-average
agglomerative clustering.
We have considered the English Wikipedia ar-
ticles which contain InterLanguage links to Hindi
articles. The English articles are clustered based on
the overlap of terms, i.e., the number of common
terms present between articles. The clustering
algorithm is detailed as follows:
Initially, consider English Wikipedia data, each
article in the dataset is considered as a single
document cluster. Now, the distance between two
clusters is calculated using
SIM-GA(?i, ?j) = 1(Ni+Nj)(Ni+Nj?1)
?
dm??i??j
?
dn??i??j ,dm 6=dn
~dm ? ~dn
where ~d is the length-normalized vector of document
d, ? denotes the dot product, and Ni and Nj are the
number of documents in ?i and ?j , respectively. Us-
ing group average agglomerative clustering, the pro-
13
cess is repeated till we reach a certain threshold (set
to 0.2) and thus the hierarchical clusters of English
data are formed. In order to cluster documents of
other languages, we availed the InterLanguage links
and structure of English clusters. The InterLanguage
links are used in replicating the cluster structure of
English Wikipedia articles across other language ar-
ticles. Therefore, we avoided the repetition of the
clustering step for non-English articles. These dif-
ferent language clusters, being interconnected, are
further utilized in our approach.
4.2 Mapping related content within interlinked
documents:
As the clustering technique used is hierarchical,
the intermediate clustering steps are gathered and
are called as subclusters. For example, if two
clusters (say Diseases, Hospitals) are merged to
form a cluster (say Medicine). Then the Diseases,
Hospitals are called subclusters for the Medicine
cluster.
We measured the average of cosine similarities
between the subtitle lists of the articles in a given
cluster. If the average similarity exceeds a threshold
(set to 0.72), it would mean the articles in the cluster
(e.g., Diseases) all share similar subtitles. Other-
wise, we go for a subcluster, until the threshold
criteria is met. E.g., any two articles of the cluster
Diseases share the common subtitles like Symptoms
of Disease, Causes, Precautions, etc. This is
illustrated in figure 1. As per our observation, the
articles of different languages pertaining to same
cluster will have same subtitles but depicted in
different languages. The Hindi articles of cluster
?Diseases? share the same subtitles with those in
English. This is illustrated in figure 2.
In order to map subtitles across languages, in
each cluster, consider the non-English article with
maximum number of subtitles and its corresponding
English article. A lookup in a bilingual dictionary
developed by Rohit et al. (2010) would help in
mapping certain subtitles. The rest of the subtitles
are mapped based on their order of occurrences.
The subtitles are likely to occur at the same order
in interlinked articles with high number of sub-
titles. The dictionary is expanded by adding the
Figure 1: Subtitles of Cancer and Multiple Sclerosis
mapped subtitles obtained from such interlinked
articles. This process is repeated with the remaining
interlinked articles. Rohit et al. had developed
the bilingual dictionary availing Wikipedia titles
and abstract information. Hence, their approach
is language-independent and doesn?t hinder our
algorithm from being applied to other languages.
Consider each subtitle of an article in a cluster
and collect its subtitle data from that article and
from its corresponding interlinked article in Hindi.
For example, consider the subtitle ?Causes?, collect
the subtitle data from an English article (say Cancer)
and map it with the subtitle data from the Hindi
equivalent page on Cancer. We now have a mapping
titled ?Causes - Cancer? for the Cancer articles
across languages. Repeat this for all articles and
group the mappings of common subtitles. Then, a
major group ?Causes? is formed. This group will
now have a set of mappings like ?Causes - Cancer?,
?Causes - Multiple Sclerosis?, etc. Thus the multi-
lingual grouping and mapping is done. This step
maps similar content of different languages. This
is one of the important contributions of the paper
which has the potential to be applied elsewhere.
4.3 Term co occurrences model:
Consider a map (e.g., ?Causes - Cancer?) which
contains both English and Hindi data. Given the
fact that the usage of English tools doesn?t hurt the
extensibility of the approach to other languages, the
English data is annotated with Stanford NER and
the NEs are retrieved. Hindi data is preprocessed
by removing the stop words. The stop words list is
generated by considering words that occur above a
certain frequency in the overall dataset.
14
Figure 2: Subtitles of Cancer article across languages
For a given map and preprocessed data, every
English NE is paired with every non-tagged Hindi
word. Attach a default weight (=1) for each pair.
Hence, a pair may look like (tagged English word,
non tagged Hindi word, 1). This step is repeated
with all other mappings present in a group (Ex:
?Causes - Cancer?, ?Causes - Multiple Sclerosis?
in the group ?Causes?). On repeated occurrence of
the same pair, weight of that pair increases (by 1).
Finally, for a English NE term, the Hindi term with
which it has highest frequency is identified. Then
the NE tag of English term is assigned to Hindi
term. Hence, Hindi word is labeled. This step is
repeated with the remaining English NEs and Hindi
terms.
For example, consider two small mappings,
each with two English NEs and one sentence
in Hindi. Consider the first map, with ?Alexan-
der/PERSON?, ?India/LOCATION? as English NEs
and
as Hindi sentence. Then each NE of English is
attached with each Hindi word (except the stop
words) like Alexander - , Alexander -
, Alexander - , India - , etc., in all
combinations. Consider the second map with
?Alexander/PERSON?, ?Philip/PERSON? as En-
glish NEs and as Hindi
sentence. The pairs would be Alexander - ,
Alexander - etc. Hence, the maximum co oc-
curred pair would be Alexander - (Alexander
in Hindi). Then the NE tag of Alexander/PERSON
is attached to /PERSON. Similarly, for the
remaining English NEs and Hindi terms, the max-
imum co-occurred pair is identified and the Hindi
term is tagged.
5 Evaluation and Experimental setup:
As our approach requires InterLanguage links, we
are only interested in a subset of English and Hindi
Wikipedia articles which are interconnected. There
are 22,300 articles in English and Hindi Wikipedia
that have InterLanguage links. The output of Hierar-
chical GAAC clustering on this subset was observed
to be 345 clusters. We have manually tagged Hindi
articles of 50 random clusters (as cluster size can
dictate accuracies) with three NE tags (i.e., Person,
Organization, Location), resulting in 2,328 Hindi
articles with around 11,000 NE tags. All further
experiments were performed on this tagged dataset.
Precision, Recall and F-measure are the evaluation
metrics used to estimate the performance of our
system.
In order to compare our system performance
with a baseline, we have availed the Hindi NER
system developed by Gali et al. (2008) at LTRC
(Language Technologies Research Center) 1 that
recognizes and annotates Hindi NEs in a given
text using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as
the sequential labeling mechanism. Their system
is reproduced on our dataset with a 5-fold cross
validation using spell variations, pattern of suffixes
and POS tagging as the features.
6 Experiments and Results:
The experiments conducted are broadly classified as
follows:
Experiment 1: Using the structure of Wikipedia
namely Category terms, we can cluster the articles
which are having similar category terms. Another
approach for clustering is to consider the Wikipedia
page as an unstructured page and then cluster the ar-
ticles based on the similarity of words present in it.
We have performed Hierarchical GAAC based clus-
tering for these experiments.
Experiment 2: Different clustering metrics will
yield different accuracies for a given data. Here, we
will measure which similarity metric is appropriate
1http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in

for the dataset under study following a Category in-
formation based clustering of articles.
6.1 Experiment 1: Whether to use structure of
the Wikipedia page:
No Category: Clustering without using the Cate-
gory information: As the first experiment, the arti-
cles are clustered based on the article text and not
using the category terms.
With Category: Clustering using the Category in-
formation: In this experiment, the category terms
are used for clustering the documents. The F-
measure suggests that category terms better capture
the semantics of an article when compared to the
text of the article. Adding to the fact that category
terms suggest a compact representation of an article
whereas the text include noisy terms. The compact
representation of articles has proved to be crucial by
our next set of experiments.

6.2 Experiment 2: Similarity metrics for
Clustering
SLAC: Single-linkage Agglomerative Clustering:
Single-linkage algorithm would make use of mini-
mum distance between the clusters as similarity met-
ric. One of the drawback for this measure is that if
we have even a single document related to two clus-
ters, the clusters are merged. In Wikipedia, we will
not have un-related documents, all the documents
will be having a certain overlap of terms with each
other. Hence, the number of clusters formed are rel-
atively less compared to other two similarity mea-
sures. Thus the measures of Precision, Recall and
F-measure are quite less.
CLAC: Complete-linkage Agglomerative Cluster-
ing: Complete-linkage algorithm would make use
of maximum distance between the clusters as simi-
larity metric. This results in a preference for com-
pact clusters with small diameters over long. Hence,
the accuracies are improved. The drawback is that it
causes sensitivity to outliers.
GAAC: Group Average Agglomerative Clustering:
Group Average is the average between single-
linkage metric and complete-linkage metric. Hence,
covers the advantages of the both, overcoming the
drawbacks of both metrics to some extent. Thus, the
accuracies have improved considerably over previ-
ous experiments.

7 Discussions:
From the above results, we have made the follow-
ing observations. (I) Experiment 1: The Category
information of Wikipedia was able to capture the se-
mantics and represent the articles in a compact way
resulting in higher accuracies over the article text
information. (II) Experiment 2: As each cluster is
processed independently while identifying NEs, the
compactness and uniformity of the clusters matter
in our approach. This is studied by considering dif-
ferent similarity metrics while forming clusters. Fi-
nally, from the experiments we conclude that forma-
tion of hard clusters matter more for better results of
the approach.
8 Conclusions
This paper proposes a method to identify the NEs
in Indian languages for which the availability of re-
sources is a major concern. The approach suggested
is simple, efficient, easily reproducible and can be
extended to any other language as it is developed un-
der a language-independent framework. Wikipedia
pages across languages are merged together at subti-
tle level and then the non-English NEs are identified
based on term-term co-occurrence frequencies. The
experimental results conclude that the use of Cate-
gory information has resulted in compact represen-
tations and the compactness of the clusters plays a
predominant role in determining the accuracies of
the system.
