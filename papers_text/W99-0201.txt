1 Abst ract  
We have developed cross document event tracking 
technology that extends our earlier efforts in cross 
document person coreference. The software takes 
class of events, like "resignations" and clusters doc- 
uments that mention resignations into equivalence 
classes. Documents belong to the same equivalence 
class if they mention the same "resignation" event, 
i.e. resignations involving the same person, time, 
and organization. Other events evaluated include 
"elections" and "espionage" events. Results range 
from 45-90% F-measure scores and we present a brief 
interannotator study for the "elections" data set. 
2 Introduction 
Events form the backbone of the reasons why peo- 
ple communicate o one another. News is interesting 
and important because it describes actions, changes 
of state and new relationships between individuals. 
While the communicative importance of described 
events is evident, the phenomenon has proved diffi- 
cult to recognize and manipulate in automated ways 
(example: MUC information extraction efforts). 
We began this research program by developing 
algorithms to determine whether two mentions of 
a name, example "John Smith", in different docu- 
ments actually referred to the same individual in the 
world. The system that we built was quite success- 
ful at resolving cross-document entoty coreference 
(Bagga, 98b). We, therefore, decided to extend the 
system so that it could handle events as well. Our 
goal was to determine whether events in separate 
documents, example "resignations", referred to the 
same event in the world (is it the same person re- 
signing from the same company at the same time). 
This new classof coreference has proved to be more 
challenging. 
Below we will present our approach and results 
as follows: First we discuss how this research is dif- 
ferent from Information Extraction and Topic De- 
tection and Tracking. Then we present he core al- 
gorithm for cross document person coreference and 
our method of scoring the the system's output. The 
method for determining event reference follows with 
presentation and discussion of results. We finish 
with an interannotator agreement experiment and 
future work. 
3 D i f fe rences  between Cross  
Document  Event  Reference  and  IE  
and TDT 
Before proceeding further, it should be emphasized 
that cross-document event reference is a distinct goal 
from Information Extraction (IE) and Topic Detec- 
tion and Tracking (TDT). 
Our approach differs from both IE and TDT in 
that it takes a very abstract definition of an event 
as a starting place, for instance the initial set of doc- 
uments for resignation events consists of documents 
that have "resign" as a sub-string. This is even less 
information than information retrieval evaluations 
like TREC. IE takes as an event description large 
hand built event recognizers that are typically finite 
state machines. TDT starts with rather verbose de- 
scriptions of events. In addition to differences in 
what these technologies take as input to describe 
the event, the goal of the technologies differ as well. 
Information Extraction focuses on mapping from 
free text into structured ata formats like database 
entries. Two separate instances of an event in 
two documents would be mapped into the database 
structures without consideration whether they were 
the same event or not. In fact, cross-document event 
tracking could well help information extraction sys- 
tems by identifying sets of documents that describe 
the same event, and giving the patterns multiple 
chances to find a match. 
Topic Detection and Tracking seeks to classify a 
stream of documents into "bins" based on a descrip- 
tion of the bins. Looking at the tasks from the TDT- 
2 evaluation, there are examples that are more gen- 
eral and tasks that are more specific than our an- 
notation. For example, the topic "Asian bailouts by 
the IMF" clusters documents into the same bin ir- 
respective of which country is being bailed out. Our 
approach would try to more finely individuate the 
documents by distinguishing between countrieS and 
times. Another TDT topic involved the Texas Cat- 
John Perry, of Weston Golf Club, an- 
nounced his resignation yesterday. He was 
the President of the Massachusetts Golf 
Association. During his two years in of- 
rice, Perry guided the MGA into a closer 
relationship with the Women's Golf Asso- 
ciation of Massachusetts. 
Oliver "Biff" Kelly of Weymouth suc- 
ceeds John Perry as president of the Mas- 
sachusetts Golf Association. "We will have 
continued growth in the future," said Kelly, 
who will serve for two years. "There's been 
a lot of changes and there will be continued 
changes as we head into the year 2000."

tlemen's Association lawsuit against Oprah Winfrey. 
Given "lawsuits" as an event, we would seek to put 
documents mentioning that lawsuit into the same 
equivalent class, but would also form equivalence 
classes of for other lawsuits. In addition, our even- 
tual goal is to provide generic ross-document coref- 
erence for all entities/events in a document i.e. we 
want to resolve cross-docuemtn coreferences for all 
entities and events mentioned in a document. This 
goal is significantly different from TDT's goal of clas- 
sifying a stream of documents into "bins". 
4 Cross -Document  Core ference  fo r  
I nd iv idua ls  
The primary technology that drives this research is 
cross-document coreference. Until recently, cross- 
document coreference had been thought o be a hard 
problem to solve (Grishman, 94). However, pre- 
liminary results in (Bagga, 98a) and (Bagga, 98b) 
show that high quality cross-document coreference 
is achievable. 
Figure 1 shows the architecture of the cross- 
document system built. Details about each of the 
main steps of the cross-document coreference algo- 
rithm are given below. 
? First, for each article, the within document 
coreference module of the University of Penn- 
sylvania's CAMP system is run on that article. 
It produces coreference chains for all the enti- 
ties mentioned in the article. For example, con- 
sider the two extracts in Figures 2 and 4. The 
coreference chains output by CAMP for the two 
extracts are shown in Figures 3 and 5. 
? Next, for the coreference hain of interest within 
each article (for example, the coreference chain 
Figure 4: Extract from doc.38 
J I r

, 
I 
I 
Figure 5: Coreference Chains for doc.38 
that contains "John Perry"), the Sentence Ex- 
tractor module extracts all the sentences that 
contain the noun phrases which form the coref- 
erence chain. In other words, the SentenceEx- 
tractor module produces a "summary" of the ar- 
ticle with respect to the entity of interest. These 
summaries are a special case of the query sensi- 
tive techniques being developed at Penn using 
CAMP. Therefore, for doc.36 (Figure 2), since 
at least one of the three noun phrases ("John 
Perry," "he," and "Perry") in the coreference 
chain of interest appears in each of the three 
sentences in the extract, the summary produced 
by SentenceExtractor is the extract itself. On 
the other hand, the summary produced by Sen- 
tenceExtractor for the coreference chain of in- 
terest in doc.38 is only the first sentence of the 
extract because the only element of the corefer- 
ence chain appears in this sentence. 
Finally, for each article, the VSM-Disambiguate 
module uses the summary extracted by the Sen- 
tenceExtractor and computes its similarity with 
the summaries extracted from each of the other 
articles. The VSM-Disambiguate module uses a 
standard vector space model (used widely in in- 
formation retrieval) (Salton, 89) to compute the 
similarities between the summaries. Summaries 
having similarity above a certain threshold are 
considered to be regarding the same entity. 
4.1 Scoring 
In order to score the cross-document coreference 
chains output by the system, we had to map the 
cross-document coreference scoring problem to a 
within-document coreference scoring problem. This 
was done by creating a meta document consisting 
of the file names of each of the documents that the 
system was run on. Assuming that each of the doc-

uments in the data sets was about a single entity, or 
about a single event, the cross-document coreference 
chains produced by the system could now be evalu- 
ated by scoring the corresponding within-document 
coreference chains in the meta document. 
We used two different scoring algorithms for scor- 
ing the output. The first was the standard algo- 
r ithm for within-document coreference chains which 
was used for the evaluation of the systems partic- 
ipating in the MUC-6 and the MUC-7 coreference 
tasks. This algorithm computes precision and recall 
statistics by looking at the number of links identified 
by a system compared to the links in an answer key. 
The shortcomings of the MUC scoring algorithm 
when used for the cross-document coreference task 
forced us to develop a second algorithm - the B- 
CUBED algorithm - which is described in detail be- 
low. Full details about both these algorithms (in- 
cluding the shortcoming of the MUC scoring algo- 
rithm) can be found in (Bagga, 98). 
4.1.1 The  B -CUBED A lgor i thm 
For an entity, i, we define the precision and recall 
with respect o that entity in Figure 6. 
The final precision and recall numbers are com- 
puted by the following two formulae: 
N 
Final Precision = ~ wi * Precisioni 
i=l 
N 
= ~ wi * Recalli Final Recall 
i----1 
where N is the number of entities in the document, 
and wi is the weight assigned to entity i in the docu- 
ment. For the results discussed in this paper, equal 
weights were assigned to each entity in the meta doc- 
ument. In other words, wi = -~ for all i. 
5 Cross -Document  Coreference for 
Events  
In order to extend our systems, as described ear- 
lier, so that it was able to handle events, we needed 
t o figure out a method to capture all the informa- 
tion about an event in a document. Previously, with 
named entities, it was possible to use the within- 
document coreference chain regarding the entity to 
extract a "summary" with respect to that entity. 
However, since CAMP does not annotate within- 
document coreference chains for events, it was not 
possible to use the same approach. 
The updated version of the system builds "sum- 
maries" with respect o the event of interest by ex- 
tracting all the sentences in the article that contain 
either the verb describing the event or one of its 
nominalizations. Currently, sentences that contain 
synonyms of the verb are not extracted. However', 
we did conduct an experiment (described later in the 
paper) where the system extracted sentences con- 
3 
taining one of three pre-specified synonyms to the 
verb. 
The new version of the system was tested on sev- 
eral data sets. 
5.1 Ana lys i s  o f  Data  
Figure 7 gives some insight into the data sets used 
for the experiments described later in the paper. In 
the figure, Column 1 shows the number of articles 
in the data set. The second column shows the av- 
erage number of sentences in the summary for the 
entity/event of interest constructed for each article. 
Column 3 shows, for each summary, the average 
number of words that were found in at least one 
other summary (in the same data set). The condi- 
tions when measuring the overlap should be noted 
here: 
? the summaries are filtered for stop words 
? all within-document coreference chains passing 
through the summaries are expanded and the 
resulting additional noun phrases are attached 
to the summaries 
The fourth column shows for each such overlapping 
word, the average number of summaries (in the same 
data set) that it is found in. Column 5 which is the 
product of the numbers in Columns 3 and 4 shows, 
for each summary, the average number of summaries, 
in the data set, it shares a word with (the amount of 
overlap). We hypothesize here that the higher the 
amount of overlap, the higher is the ambiguity in the 
domain. We will return to this hypothesis later in 
the paper. 
Figure 7 shows that the "resign" and the "espi- 
onage" data sets are remarkably similar. They have 
very similar numbers for the number of sentences per 
summary, the average number of overlapping words 
per summary, and the average number of summaries 
that each of the overlapping words occur in. A closer 
look at several of the summaries from each data set 
yielded the following properties that the two data 
sets shared: 
? The summaries usually consisted of a single sen- 
tence from the article. 
? The "players" involved in the events (people, 
places, companies, positions, etc.) were usually 
referenced in the sentences which were in the 
summaries. 
However, the "election" data set is very different 
from the other two sets. This data set has almost 
twice as many sentences per summary (2.38). In 
addition, the number of overlapping words in each 
summary is also comparatively high although the 
average number of summaries that an overlapping 
words occurs in is similar to that of the other two 
data sets. But, "elections" has a very high overlap

number (22.41) which is about 30% more than the 
other data sets. From our hypothesis it follows that 
this data set is comparatively much more ambiguous; 
a fact which is verified later in the paper. 
Assuming our hypothesis i true, the overlap num- 
ber also gives an indication of the optimal threshold 
which, when chosen, will result in the best precision 
and recall numbers for the data set. It seems a rea- 
sonable conjecture that the optimal threshold varies 
inversely with the overlap number i.e. the higher the 
overlap number, the higher the ambiguity, and lower 
the optimal threshold. 
5.2 Exper iments  and Resu l ts  
We tested our cross-document coreference system on 
several data sets. The goal was to identify cross- 
document coreference chains about the same event.

? All of the articles in the data sets were chosen 
randomly from the 1996 and 1997 editions of the 
New York Times. The sole criterion used when 
choosing an article was the presence/ absence 
of the event of interest in the data set. For ex- 
ample, an article containing the word "election" 
would be put in the elections data set.

structed manually, although scoring was auto- 
mated.

the performance of the system. We describe some of 
the more important ones below.

Figure 15: Results for the "espionage" data set using 
the B-CUBED scorer 
of the system by 3 F-measure points. The re- 
sulting increase in performance implies that the 
sentences containing the term "election" did not 
contain sufficient information for disambiguat- 
ing all the elections. Some of the disambigua- 
tion information (example: the "players" in- 
volved in the event) was mentioned in the ad- 
ditional sentences. This also strengthens our 
observation that this data set is more compar- 
atively more ambiguous. 
p resence  of  a single, large coreference chain: 
The presence of a single, large cross-document 
coreference chain in the test set affects the 
performance of a system with respect to 
the scoring algorithm used. For example, 
the "election" data set consisted of a very 
large coreference chain - the coreference chain 
consisting of articles regarding the 1996 US 
General (Congressional and Presidential) 
elections. This chain consisted of 36 of the 73 
links in the data set. The B-CUBED algorithm 
penalizes systems severely for precision and 
recall errors in such a scenario. The difference 
in the results reported by the two scoring 
algorithms for this data set is glaring. The 
MUC scorer reports a 71 point F-Measure 
while the B-CUBED scorer reports only a 43 
point F-Measure. 
5.4 The "election" Data Set 
Since the results for the "election" data set were 
significantly lower than other results, we decided to 
analyze this data set in more detail. The following 
factors makes this data set harder to deal with: 
p resence  of  sub-events:  The presence of sub- 
events that correspond to a single event makes 
the task harder. The "election" data set of- 
ten mentioned election events which consisted 
of more than one actual election. For example, 
the data set contained articles which mentioned 
the 1996 US General Elections which comprised 
of the US Congressional elections and the US 
Presidential elections. In addition, there were 
articles which only mentioned the sub-elections 
without mentioning the 'more general event. 
"p layers"  are the same: Elections is one event 
where the players involved are often the same. 
For example, elections are about the same po- 
sitions, in the same places, and very often in- 
volving the same people making the task very 
ambiguous. Very often the only disambiguating 
factor is the year (temporal information) of the 
election and this too has to be inferred. For ex- 
ample, articles will mention an election in the 
following ways: "the upcoming November elec- 
tions," "next years elections," last fall's elec- 
tions," etc. 
descriptions are very  s imi lar:  Another very im- 
portant factor that makes the "elections" task 
harder is the fact that most election issues 
(across elections in different countries) are very 
similar. For example: crime rates, inflation, un- 
employment, etc. 
6 In terannotator  Agreement  
When comparing machine performance against a hu- 
man annotation, it is important o understand how 
consistently two humans can perform the same task. 
If people cannot replicate one other, then there may 
be serious problems with the task definition that 
question the wisdom of developing automated meth- 
ods for the task. 
Both authors independently annotated the "elec- 
tions" data set with no agreed upon annotation stan- 
dard in contrast o how data sets were annotated 
in the MUC-6/7 coreference task. Instead, we used 
6 
whatever mutual understanding we had on what the 
goal of our annotation was from phone calls over the 
course of a few months. We did not develop an an- 
notation standard because we have not considered a 
sufficiently broad range of events to write down nec- 
essary and sufficient conditions for event coreference. 
For now our understanding is:
Any two events are in the same equivalence class 
if they are of the same generic class, ie "elections" 
or "resignations", and the principle actors, entities, 
and times are the same. 
This definition does not cover the specificity of 
event descriptions, i.e. the difference between the 
general November 96 elections and a particular elec- 
tion in a district (at the same time). We left this 
decision up to human judgment rather than trying 
to codify the decision at this early stage. 
Interannotator agreement was evaluated in two 
phases, a completely independent phase and a con- 
sensus phase where we compared annotations and 
corrected obvious errors and attentional lapses but 
allowed differences of opinion when there was room 
for judgment. The results for the completely in- 
dependent annotation were 87% precision and 87% 
recall as determined by treating one annotation as 
truth and the other as a systems output with the 
MUC scorer. Perfect agreement between the annota- 
tors would result in 100% precision and recall. These 
results are quite high given the lack of a clear anno- 
tation standard in combination with the ambiguity 
of the task. 
After adjudication, the agreement increased sig- 
nificantly to 95% precision and recall which indi- 
cates that there was genuine disagreement for 5% of 
the links found across two annotators. Using the B- 
CUBED scorer the results were 80% for the indepen- 
dent case and 93% for the consensus phase. These 
figures establish an upper bound on possible ma- 
chine performance and suggest hat cross document 
event coreference is a fairly natural phenomenon for 
people to recognize. 
7 Future  Research  
The goal of this research as been to gain experience 
in cross document reference across a range of enti- 
ties/events. We have focused on simple techniques 
(the vector space model) over rich data structures 
(within document coreference annotated text) as a 
means to better understanding of where to further 
explore the phenomenon. 
It is worth exploring alternatives to the vector 
space model since there are areas where it could 
be improved. One possibility would be to explic- 
itly identify the individuating factors of events, i.e. 
the "players" of an event, and then individuate by 
comparing these factors. This would be particularly 
helpful when there is only one individuating factor 
like a date that differentiates two events. 
The benefit of cross document entity reference 
centers around nove.1 interfaces to large data collec- 
tions, so we are focusing on potential applications 
that include link visualization (Bagga, 98c), question 
answering, and multi-document summarization. 
8 Conc lus ions  
We have shown that it is possible to extend our 
earlier work with cross document person reference 
to include cross document event reference. This is 
achieved by using the vector space model to form 
equivalence classes of "summaries" about the events 
in question. These summaries are generated by in- 
cluding sentences that have coreference into the core 
event sentence as well as sentences that fit within a 
synonymy class for the event in question. Our results 
are encouraging with performance ranging from 45% 
f-score to 90% f-score. We also have established that 
human annotators agree on cross document event 
reference around 95% of the time.
