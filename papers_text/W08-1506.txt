Abstract
MedSLT is a grammar-based medical
speech translation system intended for
use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues,
which provides coverage of several dif-
ferent subdomains and multiple language
pairs. Vocabulary ranges from about 350 to
1000 surface words, depending on the lan-
guage and subdomain. We will demo three
different versions of the system: an any-
to-any multilingual version involving the
languages Japanese, English, French and
Arabic, a bidirectional English ? Span-
ish version, and a mobile version run-
ning on a hand-held PDA. We will also
demo the Regulus development environ-
ment, focussing on features which sup-
port rapid prototyping of grammar-based
speech translation systems.

1 Introduction
MedSLT is a medium-vocabulary grammar-based
medical speech translation system built on top of
the Regulus platform (Rayner et al, 2006). It is
intended for use in doctor-patient diagnosis dia-
logues, and provides coverage of several subdo-
mains and a large number of different language-
pairs. Coverage is based on standard examina-
tion questions obtained from physicians, and fo-
cusses primarily on yes/no questions, though there
is also support for WH-questions and elliptical ut-
terances.
Detailed descriptions of MedSLT can be found
in earlier papers (Bouillon et al, 2005; Bouil-
lon et al, 2008)1. In the rest of this note, we
will briefly sketch several versions of the system
that we intend to demo at the workshop, each of
which displays new features developed over the
last year. Section 2 describes an any-language-to-
any-language multilingual version of the system;
Section 3, a bidirectional English ? Spanish ver-
sion; Section 4, a version running on a mobile PDA

platform; and Section 5, the Regulus development
environment.
2 A multilingual version
During the last few months, we have reorganised
the MedSLT translation model in several ways2. In
particular, we give a much more central role to the
interlingua; we now treat this as a language in its
own right, defined by a normal Regulus grammar,
and using a syntax which essentially amounts to
a greatly simplified form of English. Making the
interlingua into another language has made it easy
to enforce tight constraints on well-formedness of
interlingual semantic expressions, since checking
well-formedness now just amounts to performing
generation using the interlingua grammar.
Another major advantage of the scheme is that
it is also possible to systematise multilingual de-
velopment, and only work with translation from
source language to interlingua, and from interlin-
gua to target language; here, the important point
is that the human-readable interlingua surface syn-
tax makes it feasible in practice to evaluate transla-
tion between normal languages and the interlingua.
Development of rules for translation to interlingua
is based on appropriate corpora for each source
language. Development of rules for translating
from interlingua uses a corpus which is formed by
merging together the results of translating each of
the individual source-language corpora into inter-
lingua.
We will demonstrate our new capabilities in
interlingua-based translation, using a version of
the system which translates doctor questions in the
headache domain from any language to any lan-
guage in the set {English, French, Japanese, Ara-
bic}. Table 1 gives examples of the coverage of the
English-input headache-domain version, and Ta-
ble 2 summarises recognition performance in this
domain for the three input languages where we
have so far performed serious evaluations. Differ-
ences in the sizes of the recognition vocabularies
are primarily due to differences in use of inflec-
tion.
3 A bidirectional version
The system from the preceding section is unidi-
rectional; all communication is in the doctor-to-
patient direction, the expectation being that the pa-

tient will respond non-verbally. Our second demo,
an early version of which is described in (Bouillon
et al, 2007), supports bidirectional translation for
the sore throat domain, in the English ? Spanish
pair. Here, the English-speaking doctor typically
asks WH-questions, and the Spanish-speaking pa-
tient responds with elliptical utterances, which are
translated as full sentence responses. A short ex-
ample dialogue is shown in Table 3.
Doctor: Where is the pain?
?Do?nde le duele?
Patient: En la garganta.
I experience the pain in my throat.
Doctor: How long have you had a pain
in your throat?
?Desde cua?ndo le duele la garganta?
Patient: Ma?s de tres d??as.
I have experienced the pain in my
throat for more than three days.

4 A mobile platform version
When we have shown MedSLT to medical profes-
sionals, one of the most common complaints has
been that a laptop is not an ideal platform for use
in emergency medical situations. Our third demo
shows an experimental version of the system us-
ing a client/server architecture. The client, which
contains the user interface, runs on a Nokia Linux
N800 Internet Tablet; most of the heavy process-
ing, including in particular speech recognition, is
hosted on the remote server, with the nodes com-
municating over a wireless network. A picture of

Where? Is the pain above your eye?
When? Have you had the pain for more than a month?
How long? Does the pain typically last a few minutes?
How often? Do you get headaches several times a week?
How? Is it a stabbing pain?
Associated symptoms? Do you vomit when you get the headaches?
Why? Does bright light make the pain worse?
What helps? Does sleep make the pain better?
Background? Do you have a history of sinus disease?

the tablet, showing the user interface, is presented
in Figure 1. The sentences appearing under the
back-translation at the top are produced by an on-
line help component, and are intended to guide the
user into the grammar?s coverage (Chatzichrisafis
et al, 2006).
The architecture is described further in
(Tsourakis et al, 2008), which also gives perfor-
mance results for another Regulus applications.
These strongly suggest that recognition perfor-
mance in the client/server environment is no
worse than on a laptop, as long as a comparable
microphone is used.
5 The development environment
Our final demo highlights the new Regulus devel-
opment environment (Kron et al, 2007), which has
over the last few months acquired a large amount
of new functionality designed to facilitate rapid
prototyping of spoken language applications3 . The
developer initially constructs and debugs her com-
ponents (grammar, translation rules etc) in a text
view. As soon as they are consistent, she is able
to compile the source-language grammar into a
recogniser, and combine this with other compo-
nents to run a complete speech translation system
within the development environment. Connections
between components are defined by a simple con-
fig file. Figure 2 shows an example.
