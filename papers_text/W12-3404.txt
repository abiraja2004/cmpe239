Abstract
This paper introduces a novel unsupervised
approach to semantic role induction that uses
a generative Bayesian model. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first model that jointly
clusters syntactic verbs arguments into seman-
tic roles, and also creates verbs classes ac-
cording to the syntactic frames accepted by
the verbs. The model is evaluated on French
and English, outperforming, in both cases, a
strong baseline. On English, it achieves re-
sults comparable to state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised approaches to semantic role induction.
1 Introduction and background
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a major task in
Natural Language Processing which provides a shal-
low semantic parsing of a text. Its primary goal is
to identify and label the semantic relations that hold
between predicates (typically verbs), and their asso-
ciated arguments (Ma`rquez et al, 2008).
The extensive research carried out in this area re-
sulted in a variety of annotated resources, which,
in time, opened up new possibilities for supervised
SRL systems. Although such systems show very
good performance, they require large amounts of
annotated data in order to be successful. This an-
notated data is not always available, very expen-
sive to create and often domain specific (Pradhan
et al, 2008). There is in particular no such data
available for French. To bypass this shortcoming,
?annotation-by-projection? approaches have been
proposed (Pado and Lapata, 2006) which in essence,
(i) project the semantic annotations available in one
language (usually English), to text in another lan-
guage (in this case French); and (ii) use the resulting
annotations to train a semantic role labeller. Thus
Pado and Pitel (2007) show that the projection-based
annotation framework permits bootstrapping a se-
mantic role labeller for FrameNet which reaches an
F-measure of 63%; and van der Plas et al (2011)
show that training a joint syntactic-semantic parser
based on the projection approach permits reaching
an F-measure for the labeled attachment score on
PropBank annotation of 65%.
Although they minimize the manual effort in-
volved, these approaches still require both an an-
notated source corpus and an aligned target corpus.
Moreover, they assume a specific role labeling (e.g.,
PropBank, FrameNet or VerbNet roles) and are not
generally portable from one framework to another.
These drawbacks with supervised approaches mo-
tivated the need for unsupervised methods capable
of exploiting large amounts of unannotated data. In
this context several approaches have been proposed.
Swier and Stevenson (2004) were the first to intro-
duce unsupervised SRL in an approach that used
the VerbNet lexicon to guide unsupervised learning.
Grenager and Manning (2006) proposed a directed
graphical model for role induction that exploits lin-
guistic priors for syntactic and semantic inference.
Following this work, Lang and Lapata (2010) for-
mulated role induction as the problem of detecting
alternations and mapping non-standard linkings to
cannonical ones, and later as a graph partitioning
problem in (Lang and Lapata, 2011b). They also
proposed an algorithm that uses successive splits and
merges of semantic roles clusters in order to improve
30
their quality in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a). Finally,
Titov and Klementiev (2012), introduce two new
Bayesian models that treat unsupervised role induc-
tion as the clustering of syntactic argument signa-
tures, with clusters corresponding to semantic roles,
and achieve the best state-of-the-art results.
In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised
approach to semantic role labeling that differs from
previous work in that it integrates the notion of verb
classes into the model (by analogy with VerbNet,
we call these verb classes, frames). We show that
this approach gives good results both on the En-
glish PropBank and on a French corpus annotated
with VerbNet style semantic roles. For the English
PropBank, although the model is more suitable for
a framework that uses a shared set of role labels
such as VerbNet, we obtain results comparable to
the state-of-the-art. For French, the model is shown
to outperform a strong baseline by a wide margin.
2 Probabilistic Model
As mentioned in the introduction, semantic role la-
beling comprises two sub-tasks: argument identifi-
cation and role induction. Following common prac-
tice (Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Titov and Klemen-
tiev, 2012), we assume oracle argument identifica-
tion and focus on argument labeling. The approach
we propose is an unsupervised generative Bayesian
model that clusters arguments into classes each of
which can be associated with a semantic role. The
model starts by generating a frame assignment to
each verb instance where a frame is a clustering of
verbs and associated roles. Then, for each observed
verb argument, a semantic role is drawn conditioned
on the frame. Finally, the word and dependency la-
bel of this argument are generated. The model ad-
mits a simple Gibbs algorithm where the number of
latent variables is proportional to the number of roles
and frames to be clustered.
There are two key benefits of this model architec-
ture. First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions
about semantic frames: the model structure reflects
the subcategorisation property of the frame variable,
which also groups verbs that share the same set of
semantic roles, something very close to the VerbNet
notion of frames. Second, by ignoring the ?verb-
specific? nature of PropBank labels, we reduce the

Bayesian model.
need for a large amount of data and we better share
evidence across roles.
In addition, because it is unsupervised, the model
is independent both of the language and of the spe-
cific semantic framework (since no inventory of se-
mantic role is a priori chosen).
2.1 Model description
The goal of the task is to assign argument instances
to clusters, such that each argument cluster repre-
sents a specific semantic role, and each role corre-
sponds to one cluster. The model is represented in
the form of a plate diagram in Figure 1. The ob-
served random variables are the verb V (lemma), its
voice V o (active or passive), the words W (lemma)
that are arguments of this verb, and the syntactic de-
pendency labelsD that link the argument to its head.
There are two latent variables: the frame F that rep-
resents the class of the verb, and the role R assigned
to each of its arguments. The parameters ? of all
multinomial distributions are Dirichlet distributed,
with fixed symmetric concentration hyper-parameter
?. The frame plays a fundamental role in this set-
ting, since it intends to capture classes of verbs that
share similar distributions of role arguments.
The model?s generative story is described next,
followed by a description of the inference algorithm
used to apply the model to an unannotated corpus.
2.2 Generative story
For each verb instance, the proposed model first gen-
erates a frame cluster, a voice (active or passive), and
31
then a verb lemma from the distribution of verbs in
this frame. The number of arguments is assumed
fixed. For each argument, a role is sampled condi-
tioned on the frame. Then, a word is sampled from
the distribution of words associated to this role, and
finally a dependency label is generated, conditioned
both on the role and the voice. All multinomial pa-
rameters are collapsed, and thus not sampled. All
Dirichlet hyper-parameters are assumed constant.
To identify words, we use either word lemmas or
part-of-speech tags. In order to avoid data sparse-
ness issues, we consider the word lemma only in
cases where there are more than 9 instances of the
word lemma in the corpus. Otherwise, if the number
of word lemma instances is less than 10, we use the
part-of-speech tags.
2.3 Learning and Inference
A collapsed Gibbs sampler is used to perform poste-
rior inference on the model. Initially, all frames Fi
are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution,
while the roles Ri,j are assigned either randomly or
following the deterministic syntactic function base-
line, which simply clusters predicate arguments ac-
cording to their syntactic function. This function is
described in detail in Section 3.
The Gibbs sampling algorithm samples each la-
tent variable (Fi and Ri,j) in turn according to its
posterior distribution conditioned on all other in-
stances of this variable (noted F?i and R?(i,j) re-
spectively) and all other variables. These posteriors
are detailed next.
In the following, Ri,j represents the random vari-
able for the jth role of the ith verb in the corpus: its
value is Ri,j = ri,j at a given iteration of the sam-
pling algorithm. nrf,r is the count of occurrences of
(Fi = f,Ri,j = r) in the whole corpus, excluding
the ith instance when the superscript ?i is used. A
star ? matches any possible value. The joint proba-
bility over the whole corpus with collapsed multino-
mial parameters is:

comes:

After T iterations, the process is stopped and the
expected value of the sampled frames and roles af-
ter the burn-in period (20 iterations) is computed.
With deterministic (syntactic) initialization, T is set
to 200, while it is set to 2000 with random initializa-
tion because of slower convergence.
3 Evaluations and results
We evaluate our model both on English to situate
our approach with respect to the state of the art; and
on French to demonstrate its portability to other lan-
guages.
3.1 Common experimental setup
The model?s parameters have been tuned with a
few rounds of trial-and-error on the English devel-
opment corpus: For the hyper-parameters, we set
32
?F = 0.5, ?R = 1.e?3, ?V = 1.e?7, ?V o = 1.e?3,
?D = 1.e?8 and ?W = 0.5. For the evaluation on
French, we only changed the ?F and ?W parame-
ters. In order to reflect the rather uniform distribu-
tion of verb instances across verb classes we set ?F
to 1. Moreover, we set ?W to 0.001 because of the
smaller number of words and roles in the French cor-
pus. The number of roles and frames were chosen
based on the properties of each corpus. We set num-
ber of roles to 40 and 10, and the number of frames
to 300 and 60 for English and French respectively.
As done in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a) and (Titov and
Klementiev, 2012), we use purity and collocation
measures to assess the quality of our role induction
process. For each verb, the purity of roles? clusters
is computed as follows:
PU =
1
N
?
i
max
j
|Gj ? Ci|
where Ci is the set of arguments in the ith clus-
ter found, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold
class, and N is the number of argument instances.
In a similar way, the collocation of roles? clusters is
computed as follows:
CO =
1
N
?
j
max
i
|Gj ? Ci|
Then, each score is averaged over all verbs. In the
same way as (Lang and Lapata, 2011a), we use the
micro-average obtained by weighting the scores for
individual verbs proportionally to the number of ar-
gument instances for that verb. Finally the F1 mea-
sure is the harmonic mean of the aggregated values
of purity and collocation:
F1 =
2 ? CO ? PU
CO + PU
3.2 Evaluations on French
To evaluate our model on French, we used a manu-
ally annotated corpora consisting on sentences from
the Paris 7 Treebank (Abeille? et al, 2000), con-
taining verbs extracted from the gold standard V-
GOLD (Sun et al, 2010)1. For each verb, at most 25
sentences from the Paris 7 Treebank were randomly
1V-GOLD consists of 16 fine grained Levin classes with 12
verbs each (translated to French) whose predominant sense in
English belong to that class.

selected and annotated with VerbNet-style thematic
roles. In some cases, the annotated roles were ob-
tained by merging some of the VerbNet roles (e.g.,
Actor, Actor1 and Actor2 are merged); or by group-
ing together classes sharing the same thematic grids.
The resulting roles assignment groups 116 verbs into
12 VerbNet classes, each associated with a unique
thematic grid. Table 1 shows the set of roles used
and their relation to VerbNet roles. This constitutes
our gold evaluation corpus.
The baseline model is the ?syntactic function?
used for instance in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a),
which simply clusters predicate arguments accord-
ing to the dependency relation to their head. This
is a standard baseline for unsupervised SRL, which,
although simple, has been shown difficult to outper-
form. As done in previous work, it is implemented
by allocating a different cluster to each of the 10
most frequent syntactic relations, and one extra clus-
ter for all the other relations. Evaluation results are
shown in Table 2. The proposed model significantly
outperforms the deterministic baseline, which vali-
dates the unsupervised learning process.

3.3 Evaluations on English
We made our best to follow the setup used in previ-
ous work (Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Titov and Kle-
33
mentiev, 2012), in order to compare with the current
state of the art.
The data used is the standard CoNLL 2008 shared
task (Surdeanu et al, 2008) version of Penn Tree-
bank WSJ and PropBank. Our model is evaluated
on gold generated parses, using the gold PropBank
annotations. In PropBank, predicates are associated
with a set of roles, where roles A2-A5 or AA are
verb specific, while adjuncts roles (AM) are con-
sistent across verbs. Besides, roles A0 and A1 at-
tempt to capture Proto-Agent and Proto-Patient roles
(Dowty, 1991), and thus are more valid across verbs
and verb instances than A2-A5 roles.
Table 3 reports the evaluation results of the pro-
posed model along with those of the baseline system
and of some of the latest state-of-the-art results.

Table 3: Comparison of the proposed system (last 2 rows)
with other unsupervised semantic role inducers evaluated
on gold parses and argument identification.
We can first note that, despite our efforts to
reproduce the same baseline, there is still a dif-
ference between our baseline (Synt.Func.) and
the baseline reported in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a)
(Synt.Func.(LL)) 2.
The other results respectively correspond to the
Split Merge approach presented in (Lang and Lap-
ata, 2011a) (Split Merge), the Graph Partitioning al-
gorithm (Graph Part.) presented in (Lang and Lap-
ata, 2011b), and two Bayesian approaches presented
in (Titov and Klementiev, 2012), which achieve the
best current unsupervised SRL results. The first such
model (TK-Bay.1) clusters argument fillers and di-
rectly maps some syntactic labels to semantic roles
for some adjunct like modifiers that are explicitly
represented in the syntax, while the second model
(TK-Bay.2) does not include these two features.
2We identified afterwards a few minor differences in both
experimental setups that partly explain this, e.g., evaluation on
the test vs. train sets, finer-grained gold classes in our case...
Two versions of the proposed model are reported
in the last rows of Table 3: one with random (uni-
form) initialization of all variables, and the other
with deterministic initialization of all Ri from the
syntactic function. Indeed, although many unsuper-
vised system are very sensitive to initialization, we
observe that in the proposed model, unsupervised in-
ference reaches reasonably good performances even
with a knowledge-free initialization. Furthermore,
when initialized with the strong deterministic base-
line, the model still learns new evidences and im-
proves over the baseline to give comparable results
to the best unsupervised state-of-the-art systems.
4 Conclusions and future work
We have presented a method for unsupervised SRL
that is based on an intuitive generative Bayesian
model that not only clusters arguments into seman-
tic roles, but also explicitly integrates the concept
of frames in SRL. Previous approaches to seman-
tic role induction proposed some clustering of roles
without explicitly focusing on the verb classes gen-
erated. Although there has been work on verb clus-
tering, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
approach that jointly considers both tasks.
In this work in progress, we focused on the role
induction task and we only evaluated this part, leav-
ing the evaluation of verb classes as future work. We
successfully evaluated the proposed model on two
languages, French and English, showing, in both
cases, consistent performances improvement over
the deterministic baseline. Furthermore, its accu-
racy reaches a level comparable to that of the best
state-of-the-art unsupervised systems.
The model could be improved in many ways, and
in particular by including some penalization term for
sampling the same role for several arguments of a
verb instance (at least for core roles). Moreover, we
believe that our model better fits within a framework
that allows roles sharing between verbs (or frames),
such as VerbNet, and we would like to carry out a
deeper evaluation on this concept.
