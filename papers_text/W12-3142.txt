Abstract 
This paper describes the UPM system for the 
Spanish-English translation task at the 
NAACL 2012 workshop on statistical ma-
chine translation. This system is based on Mo-
ses. We have used all available free corpora, 
cleaning and deleting some repetitions. In this 
paper, we also propose a technique for select-
ing the sentences for tuning the system. This 
technique is based on the similarity with the 
sentences to translate. With our approach, we 
improve the BLEU score from 28.37% to 
28.57%. And as a result of the WMT12 chal-
lenge we have obtained a 31.80% BLEU with 
the 2012 test set. Finally, we explain different 
experiments that we have carried out after the 
competition. 
1 Introduction 
The Speech Technology Group at the Technical 
University of Madrid has participated in the sev-
enth workshop on statistical machine translation in 
the Spanish-English translation task. 
Our submission is based on the state-of-the-art 
SMT toolkit Moses (Koehn et al, 2007). Firstly, 
we have proved different corpora for training the 
system: cleaning the whole corpus and deleting 
some repetitions in order to have a better perfor-
mance of the translation model. 
There are several related works on filtering the 
training corpus by removing noisy data that use a 
similarity measure based on the alignment score or 
based on sentences length (Khadivi and Ney, 
2005). 
In this paper, we also propose a technique for 
selecting the most appropriate sentences for tuning 
the system, based on the similarity with the Span-
ish sentences to translate. This technique is an up-
date of the technique proposed by our group in the 
last WMT11 challenge (L?pez-Lude?a and San-
Segundo, 2011). There are other works related to 
select the development set (Hui et al, 2010) that 
combine different development sets in order to find 
the more similar one with test set. 
There are also works related to select sentences, 
but for training instead of tuning, based on the sim-
ilarity with the source test sentences. Some of them 
are based on transductive learning: semi-
supervised methods for the effective use of mono-
lingual data from the source language in order to 
improve translation quality (Ueffing, 2007); meth-
ods using instance selection with feature decay 
algorithms (Bicici and Yuret, 2011); or using TF-
IDF algorithm (L? et al, 2007). There are also 
works based on selecting training material with 
active learning: using language model adaptation 
(Shinozaki et al, 2011); or perplexity-based meth-
ods (Mandal et al, 2008). 
In this work, we have used the proposed selec-
tion method only for tuning. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Next section overviews the system. Section 3 de-
scribes the used corpora. Section 4 explains the 
experiments carried out before the competition. 
Section 5 describes the sentences selection tech-
nique for tuning. Section 6 summarizes the results: 
before the WMT12 challenge, the corresponding to 
the competition and the last experiments. Finally, 
section 7 shows the conclusions. 
2 Overall description of the system  
The translation system used is based on Moses, the 
software released to support the translation task 
(http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/) at the NAACL 
2012 workshop on statistical machine translation.  
338
The Moses decoder is used for the translation 
process (Koehn et al, 2007). This program is a 
beam search decoder for phrase-based statistical 
machine translation models.  
We have used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for 
the word alignment computation. In order to gen-
erate the translation model, the parameter ?align-
ment? was fixed to ?grow-diag-final? (default 
value), and the parameter ?reordering? was fixed to 
?msd-bidirectional-fe? as the best option, based on 
experiments on the development set. 
In order to extract phrases (Koehn et al2003), 
the considered alignment was grow-diag-final. And 
the parameter ?max-phrase-length? was fixed to 
?7? (default value), based on experiments on the 
development set. 
Finally, we have built a 5-gram language model, 
using the IRSTLM language modeling toolkit 
(Federico and Cettolo, 2007). 
Additionally, we have used the following tools 
for pre-processing the training corpus: 
tokenizer.perl, lowercase.perl, clean-corpus-n.perl. 
And the following ones for recasing, detokenizer 
and normalizing punctuation in the translation out-
put: train-recaser.perl, recase.perl, detokenizer.perl 
and normalize-punctuation.perl. 
In addition, we have used Freeling (Padr? et al, 
2010) in some experiments, an open source library 
of natural language analyzers, but we did not im-
prove our experiments by using Freeling. We used 
this tool in order to extract factors for Spanish 
words in order to train factored translation models. 
3 Corpora used in these experiments 
For the system development, only the free cor-
pora distributed in the NAACL 2012 translation 
task has been used, so any researcher can validate 
these experiments easily. 
In order to train the translation model, we used 
the union of the Europarl corpus, the United Na-
tions Organization (UNO) corpus and the News 
Commentary corpus. 
A 5-gram language model was built joining the 
following monolingual corpora: Europarl, News 
commentary, United Nations and News Crawl. We 
have not used the Gigaword corpus. 
In order to tune the model weights, the 2010 and 
2011 test set were used for development. We did 
not use the complete set, but a sentences selection 
in order to improve the tuning process. This selec-
tion will be explained in section 5. 
The main characteristics of the corpora are 
shown in Table 1. All the parallel corpora has been 
cleaned with clean-corpus-n.perl, lowercased with 
lowercase.perl and tokenized with tokenizer.perl.  
All these tools can be also free downloaded 
from http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/. 
We observed that the parallel corpora, specially 
the UNO corpus, have many repeated sentences. 
We noted that these repetitions can cause a bad 
training. So, after cleaning the parallel corpora 
with the clean-corpus-n.perl tool, we eliminated all 
repetitions that appear more than 3 times in the 
parallel corpus.

ments 
4 Previous experiments 
Several experiments were carried out by using 
different number of sentences, as it is shown in 
Table 2.  
In these experiments, we used the 2010 test set 
for tuning (news-test2010) and the 2011 test set for 
test (news-test2011). And a 5-gram language mod-
el was built with the IRSTLM tool. For evaluating 
the performance of the translation system, the 
BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) metric

has been computed using the NIST tool (mteval.pl) 
(Papipeni et al, 2002). 
Firstly, we checked the contribution of UNO 
corpus in the final result. As it is shown in Table 2, 
the results improve when we add the UNO corpus, 
although this difference is small compared to the 
increasing of number of sentences: with 1,643,597 
sentences we have a 28.24% BLEU and if we add 
around other 8 million sentences more, the BLEU 
score only increase 0.13 points (28.37%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2: Previous experiments using news-
test2010 for tuning and news-test2011 as test set 
 
We observed that UNO corpus have a lot of re-
peated sentences. So, we decided to remove repeti-
tions in the whole corpus. With this action, we 
aimed to keep the UNO sentences that let us to 
improve the BLEU score and, on the other hand, to 
delete the sentences that do not contribute in any 
way, reducing the training time. 
We did some experiments deleting repetitions: 
allowing 5 repetitions, 3 repetitions and, finally, 1 
repetition (no repetitions). Table 2 shows how the 
results improve deleting more than 3 repetitions. 
So, finally, we improved the BLEU score from 
23.24% without UNO corpus to 28.37% adding the 
UNO and to 28.47% deleting all sentences repeat-
ed more than 3 times.  
5 Selecting the development corpus 
When the system is trained, different model 
weights must be tuned corresponding to the main 
four features of the system: translation model, lan-
guage model, reordering model and word penalty. 
Initially, these weights are equal, but it is necessary 
to optimize their values in order to get a better per-
formance. Development corpus is used to adapt the 
different weights used in the translation process for 
combining the different sources of information. 
The weight selection is performed by using the 
minimum error rate training (MERT) for log-linear 
model parameter estimation (Och, 2003). 
It is not demonstrated that the weights with bet-
ter performance on the development set provide 
better results on the unseen test set. Because of 
this, this paper proposes a sentence selection tech-
nique that allows selecting the sentences of the 
development set that have more similarity with the 
sentences to translate (source test set): if the 
weights are tuned with sentences more similar to 
the sentence in the test set, the tuned weights will 
allow obtaining better translation results.  
We have considered two alternatives for compu-
ting the similarity between a sentence and the test 
set. As it will be shown, with these methods the 
results improve. 
The first alternative consists of the similarity 
method proposed in (L?pez-Lude?a and San-
Segundo, 2011), that computed a 3-gram language 
model considering the source language sentences 
from the test set. After that, the system computes 
the similarity of each source sentence in the valida-
tion corpus considering the language model ob-
tained in the first step and, finally, a threshold is 
defined for selecting a subset with the higher simi-
larity.  
The second method that we propose now is a 
modification of the first one. With the formula of 
the first method, it was observed that, in some cas-
es, the unigram probabilities had a relevant signifi-
cance in the similarity, compared to 2-gram or 3-
grams. The system was selecting sentences that 
have more unigrams that coincide with the source 
test sentences. However, these unigrams some-
times were not part of ?good? bigrams or trigrams. 
Moreover, it was detected that the previous strate-
gy was selecting short sentences, leaving the long 
ones out. 
Considering the previous aspects, a second 
method was proposed and evaluated, trying to cor-
rect these effects. The proposal was to remove the 
unigram effect by normalizing the similarity meas-
ure with the unigram probabilities of the word se-
quence. So, the similarity measure is computed 
now using the following equation:

Where Pn is the probability of the word ?n? in 
the sentence considering the language model 
trained with the source language sentences of the 
test set.

tence):

Each probability is extracted from the language 
model calculated in the first step. This similarity is 
the negative of the source sentence perplexity giv-
en the language model. 
With all the similarities organized in a sorted 
list, it is possible to define a threshold selecting a 
subset with the higher similarity. For example, cal-
culating the similarity of all sentences in our de-
velopment corpus (around 2,500 sentences) a 
similarity histogram is obtained (Figure 1).

velopment sentences respect to the language model 
trained with the source language sentence of the 
test set 
 
This histogram indicates the number of sentenc-
es inside each interval. There are 100 different in-
tervals: the minimum similarity is mapped into 0 
and the maximum one into 100. As it is shown, the 
similarity distribution is very similar to a Gaussian 
distribution. 
Finally, source development sentences with a 
similarity lower than the threshold are eliminated 
from the development set (the corresponding target 
sentences are also removed). 
All the experiments have been carried out in the 
Spanish into English translation system, using the 
corpora described in section 3 to generate the 
translation and language models. 
In order to evaluate the system, the test set of the 
EMNLP 2011 workshop on statistical machine 
translation (news-test2011) was considered. 
In order to adapt the different weights used in 
the translation process, the test set of the ACL 
2010 workshop on statistical machine translation 
(news-test2010) has been used for weight tuning. 
The previous selection strategies allow filtering 
this validation set, selecting the most similar sen-
tences to the test set. 
Figure 2 and Table 3 show the different results 
with each number of selected sentences.

ed with the normalized similarity method), the 
BLEU score starts to decrease. This decrement 
reveals that there is a subset of sentences that are 
quite different from the test sentences and they are 
not appropriate for tuning the model weights. 
The best obtained result has been 28.57% BLEU 
with 1,500 sentences of the development corpus, 
selected with the normalized similarity method. 
The improvement reached is 30% of the possible 
improvement (considering the ORACLE experi-
ment). This result is better than using the complete 
development corpus (28.47% BLEU). 
When comparing both alternatives to compute 
the similarity between a sentence (from the valida-
tion set) and a set of sentences (source sentences 
from the test set), we can see that the normalized 
similarity method allows a higher improvement. 
The main reason is that the similarity method se-
lects sentences including information about similar 
unigrams, but sometimes, these unigrams are not 
part of ?good? bigrams or trigrams. Moreover, this 
strategy selects short sentences, leaving the long 
ones out. When using the normalized similarity 
method, these two problems are reduced.

Table 4 shows the results with the 2011 test set: 
we have a 28.37% BLEU as baseline using the 
whole corpora and finally we obtain a 28.57% 
BLEU with the deletion of repetitions and the sen-
tences selection for tuning.  
With this configuration, we have obtained a 
31.8% BLEU with the 2012 test set as a result of 
the competition of this year. 
6.1 Other experiments 
We have carried out other experiments with the 
2012 test set: factored models, Minimum Bayes 
Risk Decoding (MBR) and other sets for tuning. 
However, they did not finish before the competi-
tion deadline. 
? Factored models using Freeling 
Firstly, we have trained factored models in 
Spanish with Moses (Koehn and Hoang, 2007). 
We have only factored the source language (Span-
ish) and, in order to obtain the factors for each 
Spanish word, we have used Freeling 
(http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/). 
When running the Freeling analyzer with a 
Spanish sentence and the output option ?tagged?, 
we obtain, for each word, an associated lemma, a 
coded tag with morphological and syntactic infor-
mation, and a probability. For instance, with the 
sentence ?la inflaci?n europea se desliz? en los 
alimentos?, we obtain: 
 
word lemma tag probability 
la el DA0FS0 0.972 
inflaci?n inflaci?n NCFS000 1.000 
europea europeo AQ0FS0 0.900 
se se P00CN000 0.465 
desliz? deslizar VMIS3S0 1.000 
en en SPS00 1.000 
los el DA0MP0 0.976 
alimentos alimento NCMP000 1.000 
Table 5: Freeling analyzer output 
 
We take advantage of the lemma (second col-
umn) associated to each word and we use it as fac-
tor. So, the previous sentence is factorized as ?la|el 
inflaci?n|inflaci?n europea|europeo se|se des-
liz?|deslizar en|en los|el alimentos|alimento? 
This way, two models are generated in the trans-
lation process. For the GIZA++ alignment we used 
the second factor (lemma) instead of the word. 
Results show that there is not improvement by 
using Freeling. BLEU score is a bit lower (30.95% 
in contrast to the 31.80% obtained without 
Freeling). However, we want to continue doing 
experiments with Freeling with other different 
GIZA++ alignment options different to the default 
value ?grow-diag-final?. 
On the other hand, we want to prove different 
sets for tuning. When using factored models, there 
are more weights to be adjusted and it is possible 
that 4,500 sentences are insufficient. 
 
 
342
? MBR 
The use of Minumum Bayes Risk (MBR) (Ku-
mar and Byrne, 2004) consists of, instead of select-
ing the translation with the highest probability, 
minimum Bayes risk decoding selects the transla-
tion that is most similar to the highest scoring 
translations. The idea is to choose hypotheses that 
minimize Bayes Risk as oppose to those that max-
imize posterior probability. 
If we set up this option for decoding, the results 
improve from 31.80% to 31.99%. 
? Tuning with a 2008-2011 test set sen-
tences selection 
We have also changed the set for tuning, includ-
ing the 2008 and 2009 test set in addition to the 
2009 and 2010 sets. With the four sets we have 
around 10,000 sentences. For tuning, we have se-
lected 8,000 of these sentences with the normalized 
similarity method explained in section 5. 
Table 6 shows that the results are worse. How-
ever, we have established the threshold based on 
previous experiments with the 2010 and 2011 sets. 
Now, we should test different threshold with the 
four sets in order to determine the best one.

7 Conclusions 
This paper has described the UPM statistical 
machine translation system for the Spanish-English 
translation task at the WMT12. This system is 
based on Moses. We have checked that deleting 
repetitions of the corpus, we can improve lightly 
the results: we increase the BLEU score from 
28.37% with the whole corpora to 28.47% allow-
ing only 3 repetitions of each sentence. Although 
this improvement is not significant (we have a con-
fidence interval of ?0.35), we can say that we ob-
tain a similar result by reducing very much the 
training time. 
We have also proposed a method for selecting 
the sentences used for tuning the system. This se-
lection is based on the normalized similarity with 
the source language test set. With this technique 
we improve the BLEU score from 28.47% to 
28.57%. Although this result is not significant, we 
can appreciate an improving tendency by selecting 
the training sentences. 
As a result of WMT12 challenge, we have ob-
tained a 31.8% BLEU in Spanish-English transla-
tion with the 2012 test set. Our system takes 
around 40 hours for training, 16 hours for tuning 
(with 5 minutes for the sentences selection) and 3 
hours to translate and to recase the test sentences in 
an 3.33 GHz Intel PC with 24 cores. 
Finally, we have presented other additional ex-
periments after the competition. We can improve a 
bit more the results to 32% BLEU by using the 
MBR decoding option.
