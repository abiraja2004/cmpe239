1. The ~leed for a Theory of Conceptual Memory and Inference 
aesearch in natural language over the past twenty years has 
been focussed primarily on processes relating to the analysis of 
individual sentences (parsing). Most of the early work was devoted 
to syntax. Recently, however, there has been a considerable 
thrust in the areas of semantic, and importantly, conceptual 
analysis (see ( ~ 2 )  , (Ml) , (Sl) and (C1) for example) . Whereas a 
syntactic analysis elucidates a sentence's surface syntactic 
structure, typically by producing some type of phrase-structure 
parse tree, conceptual analysis elucidates a sentence's meaning 
(the "~icture" it produces), typically via production of an 
interconnected network of concepts which specifies the interrela- 
tionships among the cohcepts referenced by the words of the 
sentence. On the one hand, syntactic sentence analysis can more 
often than not be performed "locally" that is, on single 
sentences, disregarding any sort of global context; and it is 
reasonably clear that syntax has generally very little to do 
with the meaning of the thoughts it expresses. Hence, although 
syntax is an impoatant link in the understanding chain, it is 
little more than an abstract system of encoding which does not 
for the most part relate in any meaningful way to the information 
it encodes. On the other hand, conceptual sentence analysis, by 
its very definition, is forced into, the realm of gen,e~d~ WULLU 
knowledge; a conceptual analyzer's "syntax" is the set of rules 
which can produce the range of all "reasonable" events that 
might occur in the real world. Hence, in order to parse corlcep- 
tually, the conceptual, analyzer must lnteract with a repository 
of world knowledge and world knowledge handlers (inferential 
processes). This need for such an analyzer-accessible korld 
knowledge repository has provided part sf the morivation for 
the development of the following theory of conceptual inference 
and memory 
however, the production of a conceptual network from an 
isolated sentence is only the first step in the understanding 
process. After this first step, the real question is: what 
happens to this co~ceptual network after it has been produced 
by the analyzer? That is, if we regard the conceptual analyzer 
as a specialized component of a larger memory, then the allocation 
of memory resources in reaction to each sentence follows the 
pattern: (phase 1) get the sentence into a form which is under- 
standable, then (phase 2) understand it! It is a desire to 
characterize phase 2 which has served as the primary motivation 
fbr developing this theory of memory and inference. In this sense, 
the theory is intended to be a charting-out oef the kinds of pro- 
cesses which must surely occur each time a sentence's conceptual 
network enters the system. Although it is not intended to be an 
adequate or v e r i f i a b l e  model of how these processes miqht actually 
occur in humans, the theory described in this paper has never- 
theless been implemented hs a computer model under PDP-10 
Stanford 1.6 LISP. While the implementation follows as best it 
can an intuitively correct approach to the various processes 
described, the main intent of the underlyinghheory is to propose 
a set of memory processes which, taken together, could behave 
in a manner similar to the way a human behaves when he "understands 
language" . 
2. A Simple Example 
The attentive human mind is a volatile processor. My conjec- 
ture is that information simply cannot be put into it in a passive 
way; there are very primitive inference reflexes in its logical 
architecture which each input meaning stimulus triggers. I will 
call these primitive inference reflexes "conceptual inferences", 
and regard them as one class of subconscious memory process. I 
say "subconscious" because the concern is with a relatively low- 
level stratum of "higher-level cognition", particularly insofar 
as a human applies it to the understanding of language-communicated 
information. The eventual goal is to synthesize in an artificial 
system the rbugh flow of information which occurs in any normal 
adult response to a meaningfully-connected sequence of natural 
language utterances. This of course is a rather ambitious project. 
In this paper I will discuss some important classes of conceptual 
inference and their relation to a specific formalism I have 
developed (Rl) . 
Let me first attem?t, by a fairly ludicrous example, to 
convince you (1) that your mind is more than a simple receptacle 
?or data, and (2) that you often have little control over the 
thoughts that pop up in response to something you perceive. Read 
the following sentence, pretending you were in the midst of an 
absorbing novel' 
EARLIER THAT EVENING, MARY SAID SHE HAD KILLED HERSELF. 
One of two things probably occurred: either you chose as referent 
of "herself " -  some person other than Mary (in which case every- 
thing works out fine), or (as many people seem to do) you first 
identified "herself" as a reference to Mary. In this case, 
something undoubtedly seemed awry: you ~ealized elther that your 
choice of referent was erroneous, that the. sentence was part of 
some unspecified "weird" context, or that there was simply an 
out-and-out contradiction. Of course, all three interpretations 
II are unusual in some sense because of a patzntly obvious" 
contradiction in the picture this utterance elicits. The sentence 
is syntactically aqd semantically impeccable; only when we "think 
about it" does the bis fog horn upstairs a1ert:us to the implicit 
contradiction: 
MARY SPEAK AT TIME T 
enablement infer-ence 
MARY AEIVE AT TIME T 
MARY NOT ~ I V E -  AT TIME T 
1' state-duration inference 
MARY CEASES BEING ALIVE AT TIME T-d 
T resultative inference 
MARY KILLS HERSELF AT TIME T-d 
Here is the argument: before reading the sentence, you 
probably had no suspicion that what you were about to read contalned 
an implicit contradictiun. Yet you probably discovered that 
contradiction effortlessly! Could there have been any a prior-i 
"goal direction" to the three simple inferences above? My 
conclusio~ is that there could not have been. If we view tne 
mind as a multi-dimensional "inference space", then each incoming 
thought produces a spherical burst of activity about the point 
where it lands in this space (the place where the conceptual 
network representing it is stored). The horizon of this sphere 
consists of an advancing wavefront of inferences - spontaneous 
proDes Which are sent out from the point. Most will 
lose momentum and eventually atrophy; but a few will conjoin with 
inferences on the horizons of other points' spheres. The sum of 
these "points of contact" represents tne integration of the 
thought into the existing fabric of the memory in that each point 
of contact establishes a new pathway between the new thought and 
existing knowledge (or perhaps among several sxisting pieces of 
knowledge). This to me is a pleasing memory paradigm, and there 
is a tempting analogy to be drawn with neurons and actual physical 
w a v e f r o n t s  as proposed years ago by researchers such as J o h n  
Eccles ( E l ) .  The drawing o f  t h i s  ana logy  is, however,  l e f t  for

3. Background 
Central to this theory are sixteen classes of spontaneous 
conceptual inferences. These classes are abstract enough to be 
divorced from any particular meaning representation formalism. 
However, since they were developed concurrently with a larger 
moiiel of conceptual memory (R1) which is functionally a part of 
a language comprehension system involving a conceptual analyzer 
and generator (MARGIE (S3)), it will help make the following 
presentation more concrete if we first have a brief look at the 
operation and goals of the conceptual memory, in the context of 
the com~lete language comprehension system. 
The memory adopts Schank et al's theory (Sl.S2) of Conceptual 
aependency (CD) as its basis for representation. CD is a theory 
of meaning representation which posits the existence of a small 
number of primitive actions (eleven are used by the conceptual 
memory), a number of primitive states, and a small set of 
connectives (links) which can join the actlons and states 
together into conceptual graphs (networks) . Typical -of the -links 
are : 
tne ACTOR-ACTION "main" link 
the ACTXON-OBJECT link 6 
the CAUSAL link m- 
the DIRECTIVE link % 
and the STATECHANGE link e=l -, 
Each primitive action has a case framework which defines conceptual 
slots which must be filled whenever the act appears in a conceptual 
graph. There are in addition TIME, Location and LNSTrumental 
llnks, and these, as are all conceptual cases, are obligatory, 
even if they must be i r i f s r e i i t i a l l y  filled in by the conceptual 
memory (CM). Figure 1 illustrates the CD representation of the 
sen t ence  MARY YISSED JOHN BECAUSE HE ( J O H N )  HIT BILL. Tha t

the evaluator' delegates most of the matching responsibility 
to programs - again organized by conceptual predicates - called 
normality molecules ("N-molecules") . N-molecules, which will1 
be discussed more later, can apply detailed heuristics to ferret 
oqt fuzzy confirmations and contradictions. As I will describe, 
N-molecules also implement one class of conceptual inference 
Confirmations and contradictions discovered by the evaluator 
are noted on special lists which serve a s  sources for possible 
subsequent responses by the CM. In addition, confirmations lead. 
to invocation of the structure merger, which physically replaces 
the two matching structures by one new aggregate structure, and 
thereby knits together t w o  lines of inference. As .events go, this 
is one of the most exciting in the CM. 
Inference cutoff occurs when the product of an inference's 
STRENGTH (likelihood) and its significance factor falls below 
a threshold (0.25) . This ultimately restricts the r a d l u s  of each 
sphere in the inference space, and in the current model, the 
threshold is set. low to allow considerable expansion. 
Figure 5 depicts the overall strategy of the inference 
monitor. (Rl) contains a fuller account of the inference control 
structure, whose description will be terminated at this point.

DISCUSSION: 
Our use of language presupposes a tremendous underlying lufoiqledge about 
the  rcorld. Because of t h i s ,  even i n ,  say, the  most explicit t e c lu~ ica l  ~ r i t -  
-ing, ce r ta in  assumptions a r e  made by the  ~ i ~ i t a r  (speakera about t h e  compre- 
hender ' s knowledge - - t h a t  he can fill i n  the  plethora of . de t a i l  surrounding 
each thought. In the  01,  t h i s  corresponds t o  f i l l i n g  i n  a l l  the  missing con- 
ceptual s l o t s  i n  a graph. 
The u t i l i t y  of such a process is t~iofold'. Firsr, Cbl f a i l u r e s  t o  specify 
a missing concept can serve as  a source of requests..for moreinfarmation (or 
goals t o  seek out tlla't information by CM actions i f . 0 1  is control l ing a ro- 
bot). Second, by predict ively completing the graph by application of general 
pa t t e rn  howledge of the  modeled world, novel re la t ions  q o n g  spec i f i c  con- 
cepts and ~ o k e n s  w i l l  a r i s e ,  and these can lead t o  po ten t ia l ly  s ign i f i can t  
discoveries by other inferences. 
To i l l u s t r a t e ,  a very common missing s l o t  is the instrumental case. 
lie generally leave it t o  tile imaginative powers of the  hearer to  su-mise 
the probable i n s t rmen ta l  act ion by which some ac t ion  occurred: 
(husband t o  wife) I went t o  Sl-lARS to'day. 
(wife t o  husband) How? I had t h e  c a r  a l l  day! 
Here, wife f i l l s  in t h e  instrumental slot as: "Husbimrl drove a c a r  t o  SINIS"

home t o  SEARS, e t c . ) ,  and t h i s  led  t o  her discovery of a contradiction. 
That she w y  have been premature i n  the  specif icat ion (and:had l a t e r  t o  
undo i t )  is of secondary importance t o  the phenomenon tha t  she did.  so 
spontaneously . 
In the  CM.specification inferences, as a l l  inferences, a r e  implemented 
i n  the  form of structured progrryns which rea l i ze  discrimination nets  whose 
fzern~inal nodes a r e  concepts and tokens rather- than inferences, a s  i n  generrjl

5.3 CLASS 4 : MOTIVATIONAL .INFERENCES 
The desires (intentions) of an actor can frequently be 
inferred by analyzitlg the s ta tes  (ESULTATIVE inferences) 
which result  'from an action he executes. These \VAN?- STATE 
patterns are essential  t o  understanding and should be made 
in  abundance.

DISCUSSIOK:

Language is  a dual system of communication i n  tha t  it usually corn- 
hunicates both the actual, and, e i ther  expl ici t ly  o r  by inference, the 
-
intentional-. ifliere the intentions of actors (the s e t  of s ta tes  .they de- 
s i re )  are not explici t ly communicated, they must be inferred as t h e  
immediate causality of theI action. In  the Ch! candidates for  bDTIVATIONAL 
inferences a r e  the WSULTATIVE inf er'ences f 3  the oil can produce trorn 
an action A: for  each RESULTATIVE inference Ri which the  (34 could make 
from A , it conjectures that  perhaps the actor of A des5,red I? i 
Since the  generat ion of PRTIVATIONAL inference is dependent upon the 
results  of another class  of ihference (in general, the actor could have 
desired things causally removed by several inferences from the immediate 
resul t S  of his act  ion) , the bY3TIVATIOW inference process is  implemented 
by a special proceuur* POSTSCAN 1~~11ich is invoked betweer "passes" of the 
nuin breadth-first monitor. Thesc passes w i l l  bc discussed nlorc l a t e r .  
Once generated, each >DTIVATIOW w'i11 generally lead back- 
\,lard, via CAUSATILT inferences, into an ent i rc  causal chain ~dlich lead up 
to  the  action. This  chain w i l l  f12quently connect in  interesting ways with 
chains working fonuard from otllcr actions. 
5 . 4  CLASS 5 : . E.NA.BL.1N.G. I.JSl@ERENCES 
Every action has a set of enabling conditions - -  conditions 
which must be met f o r  the action t c ~  begin or proceed. The 
Of needs a rich h0\4ledge of these conditions (states), and 
should infer s u t a b l e  ones t o  surrounJ. each perceived action.

**Mary told Pete that  John MS at the store- 
(inference) Mary he~+r-t l ia t  Jolm was a t '  the store.  
DJSCUSSION: 
The example a t  the beginning df- the paper contained a co~~t rnd ic t ion  
which could be discovered only ,making a very simple enabl ing inference 
about the action of speaking (any action for  that  mattcr) , namcly that tllc 
actor was alive a t  the  time! Enabling inferences can f r u i t f u l l y  lend from 
the known action through the  cnabl ing s t a t e s  t o  p r d i c n t  ions about other 
actions the actor niight liave performed i n  order to set  up bthe enabling s ta tes  
for  the primary action. This idea is closely related to t he  next class of 
inference. 
5 - 5  CI3S.S 6 :  ACTION PREDICTION INFERENCES 
PRINCIPLE : Whenever some WANT STATE of a po ten t ia l  actor  is knohn, 
predictions about .possible  actions the  ac tor  might perform 
'to achieve the s t a t e  should be attempted. These predic- 
t ions  w i l l  provide potent potent ia l  points of contact 
f o r  subsequently perceived actions.  
EXANPLES : **John '~vants some na i l s .  
(inference) John might attemp-t t o  acquire some na-ils.  
**Mary is furious a t  Rita.  
(inference) b h r y  might do something t o  hurt  Ri ta .  
DISCUSSION: 
Action prediction inferences serve the' Inverse r o l e  of EfOT1VATIONA.L 
inierences, i n  t ha t  they work forward from a kno~m \VANT STATE pat tern in to  
predictions about future actions which could produce the  desired s t a t e .  
Ju s t  a s  a bRTILT~lTIONAL inference r e l i e s  upon RESUZTATIVE inferences, an 
ACTIOX PRLDICTION inference r e l i e s  upon CI\USATIVE Wferences which can be 
generated from the  s t a t e  the  potent ia l  actor desires .  Because it is of ten 
impossible to  ant ic ipa te  the f - i c  causing action,  ACTION PREDIDION 
inferences typical ly  w i l l  be,'more general e x p e c t m i e s  f o r  a c lass  of ~ o s -  
s i b l e  actions. In the na i l s  example abve,  the  general expentancy is, s i m -  
~ l y  tha t  John may do something which normally causes a PTIWNS -( in  CD t e r -  
minology,, a change of location of some object) of some n a i l s  from some~\~here 
t o  himself .  Often the nature  of the desired s t a t e  is  such tha t  some speci f ic  
act ion can be predicted ("John is  hungry. . . John w i l l  ingest food.") By mah- 
ing speci f ic  a c t i o ~ l  predictions,  a new crop of enabling inferences can be pre- 
dicted ("John must be near food. ", etc .  ) ,, and those conditions which cannot be 
assumed t o  be already sa t i s f i ed  can.serve as new \LAW-SpTEs of the  actor .  
Thus it is through bDTIVATIOhlAL, ACTION PRFBICTION and ENABLING inferences 
t h a t  the CM can model [ p r ~ d i c t )  the  pr-oblem-solving bel~avior of each actor .  
Predicted act i ~ n s  ~lihich match up \ii t h  subsequently perceived conceptual  
input serve a s  a very r e a l  measure of the  8!'s success a t  piecing together con- 
nected discourse and s to r ies .  1 suspect i n  addition tha t  ACTION P ~ I C T I O N  
inferences will play a key ro le  i n  t h e  eventual solutions of the  "co~ltextuhl 
guidance of inference" problem. Levy { L l )  ha5 some in teres t ing  beginning

years " la ter ,  uses that  information in  the generation of some other infer -  
ence is a b i t  unsett l ing! The M must simply possess a low-level function 
whose job it is t o  preciilct mornal durations of s t a t e s  based on the par t iculars  
of t h e  s t a t e s ,  and 'to use that informatim i n  marking as "terminated" those 
s t a t e s  whose 1 ikelihood has diminished below some thresl~olld .
hly conjecture is  tha t  a human notices and updates the temporal t r u th  
of a ; t a t e  only when he is about t o  use it i n  some cognitive a c t i v i t y  - -  ' 
that most of the  t ransient  howledge in  our-heads is out .of date W t i l  \ie 
again attempt t o  use it in,- say,.some inference. Accordingly, before using 
any s t a t e  information, the CM f i r s t  f i l t e r s  it. througlt the STATE DURATIOIt 
inference' proccss t o  a r r ive  a t  an updated estimate of the  state 's l i k e l i -  
hood as a .function of i t s  known s t a r t i n g  time (i ts  TS f e a t u r e , - i n  CD 
notation-) . 
The *lenlentation of t h i s  process i n  the Q! is as follows: an (NDLTR S ?) 
structure is constructed f6r the  state S who% duration-is to be pre- 
dicted, and this is passed t o  the NDUR spec i f i e r  molecufe: The NDUR S- 
molecule applies discrimination tests on featur~s of the  ~ b j e c t s  involved 
i n  S. Terminal nodes m tne net are duration concepts ( typica l ly  fuzzy 
ones), such as #ORDERliOUR, #ORDERY&U. If a terminal node can be success- 
f u l l y  reached, thus locat-ing such a concept D, t he  property MNU: (Cltnractcr- 
i s t i c  time-.function) is retrieved from D's property list. C1I.W is 
a s t ep  function of STRE;\GTH vs. the amount o f  t ime some state 
has been i~ existence (Fig. 10).  From t h i s  function a STREhrm i s  computed 
for S and bpcomes S's. predicted likelillood. I f  the STREVGTl1 turns out 
t o  be sufficiently low, a (TI: 3 ?ow) structure is predictively generated 
t o  make S ' s  101~ likelihood eQlicit. The STATE.DURATIOX inference thus  
acts as a cleansing f i l ter  on s tate  infomat ion rd~icll is fed to  various

5.12 CLASSES 14 and 15: -FEATURE and SITUATION INFEPENCES 
PRINCIPLE: bhny inferences can bc b s e d  solely on commonly sbserved 
o r  learned associations, ra ther  than upon "logical" re: 
lations such as  causation., motivation, and so for th .  In 
a rough way, we can compare these inferences t o  t h e  phe- 
nomenon of visual imagery which constructs a "picture" 
of a thdught ' s surrounding environment. Such inferences 
sllould be made i n  abundance. 
EMlPLES,:, **Andy's diaper is wet. 
(inference) Andy is a youngster. (FEITL!) 
'** J o h  was on h i s  way to a masquerade. 
(inference) John \<as probably wearing a costumeD. (SITUATIOS) 
DISCUSSION: 
Jbny llassociativel' inferences can be made to produce nel*. features o f '  
an object (or aspects of s si tuat ion) from known features.  If something 
wags-its tail, it is probably an animal o'f some so r t ,  i f  it bitesethe mail- 
man's leg,  i r . is  probably a dog, if  it has a gray beard and speaks, it is 
probably an old man, if it honks in a dis t inc t ive  way, it is probably some 
so r t  of vehicle, e tc .  These classes are -?nT~ereiltl-y unstructured, so I will 
say no.more about them here, except tha t  they frequently contribute fea-? 
tures which help c lear  up reference ambiguities and i n i t i a l  reference fail-. 
ures. 
5.13 CLASS 16 ; UTTERANCE INTENT INFERENCES -
PRINCIPLE : Based on the way a thought is conununicated (especially the 
often tel l ing presence or absence of information) , infer- 
ences cm be made about the speakerf s reasons for speaking. 
L W L E S  : 
. . 
**Don't eat green gronks. 
(inference) Other kinds of gronks are probably edible 
**Mary threw out the rotten part of the f ig.  
(inference) She threw it out because it was rotten. 
**John was unable to  get an aspirin. 
(inference) John wanted t o  get. an aspirin. 
**Rita l ike thexhair ,  but it was green. 
(inference) Tl~e c a e ' %  color is. a negative deature to .  
Rita (or the speaker). 
DISCUSSION: 
I have included this  class only to represent the largely unexplored 
domain o t  interences & a m  from the way a thought is phrased. The 0 1  w i l l  
eventualiy need an explicit model of conversation,. and this  model w i l l ,  in- 
corporate inferences from this  class.  Typical of such inferences are t-hose, 
which translate the inclusion of ~e fe r en t i a l l y  superfluous features of an 
obj ect into an implied causality relation (the f i g  example) , those which 
infer desire from fai lure (the aspirin examplej those which infer features 
of an 0,rdinary X from features of special kinds of X . (the gronk e x q ? l e ) ,  
and so .forth. These issues w i l l  lead t o  a more,goal directed-model than J 
am current1.y exploring.

This can be put - to  use i n  two rpys. 
F i r s t ,  %mplicitly touched concepts can c l a r i f y  1%??1at might otherwise 
be an u t t e r l y  opaque subsequent teference. I f ,  fo r  instance, someone says 
(outside of a parvicular context): "The nurses were nice", you w i l l  prob- 
ably inquire "\tIlat nurses?" I f ,  on the  other hana, someone says : ''John 
\ias ~ u n  over by a milk truck. \\%en he woke up. the  nurses were nice" you 
w i l l  experience nei ther  doubt about t he  referents  of ' " t h e ~ u r s e s " ,  nor 
s u v r i s e  at t h e i r  mention. I presume tha t  a -subconscious f i l l ing -ou t  of 
the s i tua t ion  "Jolm \\;as run over by .a milk truck!' implic i t ly  ac t iva tes  an 
en t i r e  s e t  of coneptually relevant concepts, "prechnrging" ideas of 110s- 
p i t a l s  and t h d r  r e l a t ion  ro patients.  
Other theories foundcd more on. concept associationism than conceptual 
inference have suggested tha t  such ac t iva t ion  occurs through ~ o r d - ~ i o r d  or
concept-concept f r ee  associ,ations (see (A2) and (91) fo r  instance) . hhile 
these more d i r ec t  aseociations play an undoubted r o l e  i n  many language 
functions, it is my belief tha t  these s t r a igh t  asspcia t ive  phenomena a r e  
not fundamentally powerful enough t o  explain the kin2 of language behavior 
underlying the nurse example. I t  is more often than not the. "gesta l t t1  
meaning context of an utterance which r e s t r i c t s  the  kinds of meaningful 
associat ions a human makes. In contrast  t~ the nurse example above, 
most people would agree t h a t  the reference t o  "the nurses" i n  the  fol1'01c- 
ing s i tua t ion  is  a b i t  peculiar:, 
In the dark of the night, John kid ~ i a l l o s~ed  
through the knee-deep mud t o  the north \call 
of the  deserted animal hospi ta l .  The nurses 
were nice. 
A simple hospital-nurses associat ionn~odel  cannot account t o r  t h l s .  Un 
the other hand, those concepts touched by t h e  more r e s t r i c t i v e  conceptual 
inference patterns would presumably be qu i t e  d i s t an t  from the  medical 
staff of a hospital i n  t h i s  example, thus explainirig the incongruity. 
Relat-ed t o  t h i s  idea of concept act ivat ion tlnough conceptual infer - 
ence structures is another mechanism wllich, I -presume, underlies a compre- 
hendersr a b i l i t y  t o  se lec t  (almost unerringly) the  propeF senses of words 
in comext dvr-ing the 1:nguist ic malysis of each utterance. This 
mecl~mis~r is frequently cal led -- word sense proribtion, and i ts  
exact nazure is one of the major ~~~~~~s of language analysis.  It 
underlies our a b i l i t y  t o  avoid - -  almost t o t a l l y  - -  backing up t o  reinte't- 
p re t  words. I t  is a s  though a t  each moment during our comprehension Ice 
possess a dynamically sh i f t ing  predisposition toward a unique sense of 
jus t  about any word we a r e  l ike ly  t o  hear next. F ig .  13 contams some 
i l lus t r a t ions  of t h i s  phenomenon. 
I have ~ n l y  a thought (which I plan t o  develop) on t h i s  issue. A t  
each instant i n  the  Of, there is  a porcerful inference momentum which is 
the product of conceptual mferences. -Obviously, these concepts rillich 
the inference patterns touch w i l l  correspond t o  senses of - -  \cords. These 
senses can be "promotecl" in the same way in-tpl-icit activa'tion promotes 
cer ta in  referents.  This  is a p a r t i a l  expl-anation or word sense promotion. 
Suppose, however; that  i n  a d d i t i o ~  the 0 1  had an independent pa ra l l e l  pro- 
cess w l ~ i c h  took each inference a s  it arose and-mapped it back into a near- 
language "proto-sentence", a l inear  sequence of concepts which is almost 
a sentence of the lmguage, except tha t  the actual  word rea l iza tes  of each 
concept have not yet been chosen. In other words, a generation process 
(see (Gl) for  exam~le) would be applied t o  each inference, but would be 
stoppeci short  of the  f i na l  lexical  subst i tut ions of word senses. By pre- 
cnarging a l l  tne senses of the various words ~+llicll could be substituted in 
such a proto-sentence, the 0 1  would, have a word sense "set" which ~coulll be 
a function of the kind of r e s t r i c t i ve  inferent ia l  context ~dlicli I ice1 i s  
so v i t a l  t o  the prQcess of analysis. This. idea is obviously cb~puf  a t  ionally 
exorbitant, but it might model a very r ea l  mecl1anisnl. he often catch our- 
selves subvocal izing \+hat we expect to hear next (especially --- - .-.. 1 istening 
t o  an a m y i n g l y  slow speaker), and t h i s  is tantal izing evidence that  sonc- 
thing l i ke  a proto-sentence generator is thrashing about ups.t:tirs.

APPENDIX B 
INFERENCE-REFERENCE RELAXATION CYCLE, COMPUTER EXAMPLE 
This computer example illustrates reference-inference, reference-inference inieraction ( two 
inference passes). Hearing the input "8111 saw John kiss Jenny.", MEMORY-is unable to  decide 
upon the referent of "Jenny": i t  could be Jenny Jones or Jenny Smith. MEMORY therefore 
creates a temporary token hav~rlg as features all the common features of Jenny Jones and Jenny 
Srnlth. By inference, MEMORY is able to decide upon Jenny Jones. At that point, the temporary 
token is merged inlo the concept !nr Jenny Jones, and a second pass 0 1  inferencinr is initiated. 
However, on the second pass a new inference arises: because Bill loves Jenny Jones, and he saw 
John kiss her, he (probably) becams angry at John. This inference was not tr iggered on t h e  first 
inference pass.because beiing loved by Bill was not a common feature of both Jennys, and hence 
not accessible then (ie. i t  had not been copied to  the temporary token's occurrence set). 
The example begins with a few lines to set the scene for MEMORY, Inferencine on these 
setup lines (which is normally spontan~ous) has been suppressed for the sake of simplicity in 
this example.
