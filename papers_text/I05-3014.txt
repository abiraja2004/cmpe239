Abstract.
This paper deals with the robust 
expansion of Domain Lexico- 
Taxonomy (DLT). DLT is a domain 
taxonomy enriched with domain lexica. 
DLT was proposed as an infrastructure 
for crossing domain barriers (Huang et 
al. 2004). The DLT proposal is based 
on the observation that domain lexica 
contain entries that are also part of a 
general lexicon. Hence, when entries of 
a general lexicon are marked with their 
associated domain attributes, this 
information can have two important 
applications. First, the DLT will serve 
as seeds for domain lexica. Second, the 
DLT offers the most reliable evidence 
for deciding the domain of a new text 
since these lexical clues belong to the 
general lexicon and do occur reliably in 
all texts. Hence general lexicon 
lemmas are extracted to populate 
domain lexica, which are situated in 
domain taxonomy. Based on this 
previous work, we show in this paper 
that the original DLT can be further 
expanded when a new language 
resource is introduced. We applied 
CiLin, a Chinese thesaurus, and added 
more than 1000 new entries for DLT 
and show with evaluation that the DLT 
approach is robust since the size and 
number of domain lexica increased 
effectively. 
1.  Introduction 
Domain-based language processing has an 
inherent research dilemma when the 
construction of domain lexicons is involved. 
The standard approach of building domain 
lexicon from domain corpora requires a very 
high threshold of existing domain resources and 
knowledge. Since only well-documented 
domains can provide enough quality corpora, it 
is likely these fields already have good manually 
constructed domain lexica. Hence this approach 
is can only deal with domains where only 
marginal benefit can be achieved, while it 
cannot deal with domains where it can make 
most contribution since there is not enough 
resources to work with. 
It was observed that the type of domain 
language processing that has the widest 
application and best potentials are cross-domain 
and multi-domain in nature. For instance, a 
typical web-search is a search for specific 
domain information from the www as an archive 
of mixed and heterogeneous domains. The 
contribution will be immediate and salient to be 
able to acquire resources and information for a 
new domain that is not well documented yet. 
A new approach towards domain language 
processing by constructing an infrastructure for 
multi-domain language processing called the 
Domain Lexico-Taxonomy (DLT) was proposed 
in Huang et al (2004). In the DLT approach, 
domain lexica are semi-automatically acquired 
to populate domain taxonomy. This lexically 
populated domain taxonomy serves two 
purposes: as the basis of stylo-statistical 
prediction of the domain of a new text, and as 
the core seed of complete domain lexica. For the 
first purpose, the DLT approach relies crucially 
on the ability to effectively identify words that 
are good indicators of specific domains. For the 
second purpose, the DLT needs to be robust 
enough to allow incremental expansion when 
new content resources are integrated. In this 
study, we integrate CiLin, a Chinese thesaurus, 
to show that the DLT architecture is indeed 
robust.

2.  Related Work
Typical studies on domain lexica focuses on 
assigning texts to specific classes, hence they
use a limited taxonomy augmented with a small 
set of features (e.g. Avancini et al 2003,
Sebastiani 2002, and Yand and Pederson 1997).
However, specialized lemmas cannot be useful 
in multi-domain processing. To achieve domain
versatility in processing, it is necessary to 
identify lemmas with wider distributions and yet
is associated with particular domain(s). We
follow the DLT architecture (Huang et al 2004), 
which was shown to be effective in predicting 
the domain of documents extracted from the 
web. We aim to elaborate that framework by 
proposing a domain lexica can be incrementally 
expanded with knowledge from a new resource. 
3.  Domain Taxonomy
A domain taxonomy containing 549 nodes was 
manually constructed. The main sources of
domain classification are from Chinese Library 
Classification system, Encyclopedia Britannica 
and the Global View English-Chinese dictionary.
Two important criteria were chosen: that the 
taxonomy is bilingual and that it is maintained
locally. First, the bilingual taxonomy is essential
for future cross-lingual processing but also 
allows us to access relevant resources in both 
languages. Second, since our emphasis was not 
on the correctness of a dogmatic taxonomy but
on the flexibility that allows monotonic
extensions, it is essential to be able to monitor
any changes in the taxonomy.
There are four layers in the constructed 
domain taxonomy. Fourteen (14) domains are in 
the upper layer, including Humanities, Social 
Science, Formal Science, Natural Science,
Medical Science, Engineering Science,
Agriculture and Industry, Fine Arts, Recreation,
Proper Name, Genre/Strata, Etymology, Country
Name, Country People. The Second layer has 
147 domains. The third layer has 279 domains.
Lastly the fourth layer has only 109 domains
since not all branches need to be expanded at 
this level. In sum, there are 549 possible domain
tags when the hierarchy is ignored. The domain
taxonomy is available online at the Sinica BOW
website (http://BOW.sinica.edu.tw/, Huang and
Chang 2004).
4. Detection of Domain Lexicon in DLT
The challenge in integrating heterogeneous 
language resources for domain information is 
that conceptual classification varies from one 
resource to another and hence cannot be directly
harvested. We propose to utilize the inheritance 
relations of these resources, instead of their 
hierarchy. In other words, lexical (and hence 
conceptual) identity is established first, 
following by expanding this matching with 
logical inheritance but without branching out on
the conceptual hierarchy.
DLT establish the correspondences 
between the taxonomic nodes of domains and 
the linguistic resources of sub-lexica. Note that 
a lexical knowledgebase, in a Wordnet fashion,
also contains hierarchical relations. The domain
taxonomy can be enriched by taking the
hierarchical information internal to the lexica. If 
these resources directly encodes the ?is-a?
relation by hyponymy, we assume that both the
node (lexicons) and their hyponym node 
(lexicons) belong to that domain. Using the
simple supposition, we can observe the domain
knowledge with various resources, and
strengthens the domain lexica for domain
taxonomy. The process of populating DLT is
shown in Fig. 1.

5.  Experiment 
5.1. The Original Study with Bilingual 
WordNet
The original DLT work was based on bilingual 
Wordnet (Huang et al 2004). This is because of 
the Wordnet lexical knowledgebase is highly 
enriched with lexical semantic relation 
information. In addition, the bilingual Wordnet 
adds an unparallel dimension of knowledge 
coverage. The bilingual Wordnet used is Sinica 
BOW (The Academia Sinica Bilingual 
Ontological WordNet, Huang and Chang 
(2004)). Sinica BOW is bilingual lexical 
knowledgebase connecting WordNet and SUMO 
and mapping both between English and Chinese. 
The study reported in Huang et al (2004) also 
contains a small domain identification 
experiment to show the application of DLT.  
5.1.1 Description of WordNet and Sinica 
BOW
WordNet is inspired by current psycholinguistic 
and computational theories of human lexical 
memory (Fellbaum (1998), Miller et al (1993)). 
English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs 
are organized into synonym sets, each 
representing one underlying lexicalized concept. 
Different semantic relations link the synonym 
sets (synsets). The version of WordNet that 
Sinica BOW implemented is version 1.6, with 
nearly 100,000 synsets. 
In Sinica BOW, ach English synset was 
given up to 3 most appropriate Chinese 
translation equivalents. And in cases where the 
translation pairs are not synonyms, their 
semantic relations are marked (Huang et al 
2003). The bilingual WordNet is further linked 
to the SUMO ontology. We use the semantic 
relations in bilingual resource to expand and 
predict domain classification when it cannot be 
judged directly from a lexical lemma. 
5.1.2 Experiment and Result with WordNet 
463 of the 549 nodes in the domain taxonomy 
were successfully mapped to a WordNet synset 
through an identical lemma. 452 or 463 
mappings were manually confirmed to be 
correct, a precision score of over 97%. These 
domains were expanded to cover a total of 
11,918 synsets corresponding to 15,160 Chinese 
lemmas. Note that both English and Chinese 
correspondences are used since our resources 
(WordNet and domain taxonomy) are both 
bilingual.
Due mostly to hyponymy expansion, each 
lemma is mapped to 1.38 domains in average. 
While each lemma is assigned to no more than 8 
domains, with the majority (6,464) assigned to 
only one. These mapped lemmas populate a set 
of domain lexica. The number of entries in these 
domain lexica ranges from 1 to 3762. The 
average size of these domain lexica is 32.8 
lemmas. Only 41 domains lexical contain 33 or 
more lemmas. Since we cannot know the 
effective of the lexicon of a domain a priori, we 
take those whose size are above average as the 
effective domain lexica. 
These domain lexica and their sizes are 
shown in Table 1. 
5.1.3 Evaluation: precision of domain lexica 
It is impossible to formally evaluate the recall 
rate of this domain lexica study since we do not 
know the total number of entries to be recalled. 
However, it is possible to evaluate the precision 
rate of the constructed domain lexica. First, the 
precision of all recalled lemmas is tested. 
Among the mapped lemmas, 8696 (out of 
15,160) lemmas are assigned to multiple 
domains, while 6,464 are assigned to single 
domain. The single domain mappings were 
spot-checked to be correct. On the other hand, 
the precision of all 8,696 multi-domain lemmas 
are carefully evaluated. Among these lemmas, 
only 4.81% (418) proves to be wrong; and an 
overwhelming majority of 95.19% turns out to 
be correct (8278). 
Second, a more meaningful test is to 
evaluate how well the domain lexica are defined. 
Five effective domain lexica with over 100 
entries were randomly chosen for evaluation: 
Insect (515 entries), Natural Science (262 
entries), Sports (180 entries), Dance (124 entries) 
and Religious Music (48 entries).  
The manually checked precision of these 
domain lexica is listed below the Table 2:

Table 2. Size and Precision of selected domain lexica 
Table 2 shows an overall precision of over 95%, 
while no other lexica has precision lower than 
86%, natural science is lowest at just below 70%. 
This is because ?Natural Science? is a higher 
level domain and hence open to more noises in 
the detection process. This study clearly showed 
that the WordNet helped to effectively build 
core domain lexica. 
We take the domain ?Dance? as an 
example to explain the process. First, we map 
?Dance? to the Wordnet synset??dance?, and 
we look for the hyponym synsets. Table3 will be 
shown the expanding lexica of one of hyponym 
synsets. These lexical entries are associated with 
domain ?Dance? and populate the domain 
lexicon.

5.2 For CiLin 
5.2.1 Description of CiLin 
CiLin, a short name for Tongyici CiLin, is a 
Chinese thesaurus published in 1984 (Mei et al 
1984). The terms in CiLin are organized in a 
conceptual hierarchy, with near-synonym terms 
forming a set. There are five levels in the 
taxonomy structure of CiLin. The CiLin terms 
between Level1 to Level4 are taxonomy 
categories. Level1 is the upper class, and it 
includes 12 categories, like as people, object, 
time and space, abstract etc. Level2 has 106 
categories. Level3 has 3,948 categories. Level4 
has 4,014 categories. There are 64,157 terms in 
Level5 since all branches need to be expanded 
at this level. These terms are classified to 12,193 
sets by the meaning. The average number of 
terms in each set is 5.34. Fig. 2 shows the 
structure of CiLin.

5.2.2. Experiment and Result with CiLin
First, we map the 549 domains to CiLin?s
taxonomy. Unlike the previous study, only
Chinese terms were available on CiLin. The
result is given in Table 4.

# of

Level 2 1,587 3 529
Level 4 1,222 32 38.19
Table 4. Number of expanding entries and 
mapping domains
Manual checking showed that mappings to 
Level 1 and Level 2 are both imprecise and 
small in number. Hence we take Level 4 as the 
lexical anchor for enriching domain lexica.
1,222 lexical items are expanded from 32 
domains, and these domain lexica and their sizes
are shown in Table 5.

Table 5. Domain lexica 
When all mappings are evaluated, 873(71.44%)
of them are correct, and 349 (28.56%) incorrect. 
Five effective domain lexica are evaluated, as
shown below in Table 6: 
Domain Label # of entries Precision (%)
Insect 146 58.9
Country 128 55.47
Theater 116 80.17
Painting 88 80.68
Dance 52 80.77
Table 6. Size and Precision of selected domain lexica
Compared with the work reported in (Huang et 
al. 2004), both the number of lemma (1,222 vs.
15,160) and precision (71.44% vs. nearly 95%)
are lower. This result is expected since CiLin
has a simple taxonomy without the rich lexical 
information of a Wordnet. The crucial fact
shown, however, is that DLT can be
incrementally enhanced with the new mappings. 
Of the 873 correct domain lexica entries, 79.5%
(694) are new entries that were not identified
previously. Even more impressive is the 
effectiveness of increase in lexica sizes for 
applicable domains, as shown below in Table 7.

Table 7. Increase in Domain Lexicon Size after CiLin Integration 
Table 7 shows that, even though adding CiLin 
only helped 32 domain lexica, 14 of them have 
their lexicon size more than doubled. One of 
them, ranching and animal husbandry is a new 
domain lexicon where no mapping was possible 
with WordNet. In other words, adding the CiLin 
resource substantially enhanced effective 
domain coverage of DLT. 
6.  Conclusion 
In this paper, test the robustness of the DLT 
architecture. We show both the coverage and the 
sizes of the domain lexica on DLT can be 
effectively expanded by integrating a new 
language resource. The robustness is convincing 
given that the coverage and quality of the new 
resource is actually not as good as the original 
reference resources. In other words, we showed 
the open architecture of DLT facilitates 
integration of new domain information without 
imposing any high threshold on the format and 
quality of new resources. We also verify partial 
results of previous work since 205 lemma 
mappings were repeated. For future work, we 
plan to continue to populate DLT, as well as to 
explore other possibilities for putting DLT to 
actual applications.
