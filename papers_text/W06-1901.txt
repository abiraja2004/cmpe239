Abstract 
A Question Answering (QA) system allows 
the user to ask questions in natural language 
and to obtain one or several answers. If 
compared with a classical IR engine like 
Google, what kind of key benefits QA bring 
to users and how to measure their distinctive 
performances. This is what we shall attempt 
here to determine, specially in providing a 
comparative weak and strong points table of 
each system, along with showing how QA 
systems, in particular our Qristal QA system, 
requires up two to six time less ?user effort?. 
1 Introduction 
Asking questions in natural language and obtain 
short answers (if possible the exact answer) 
make QA systems the paramount of Information 
Retrieval. 
Through TREC and CLEF international 
campaigns, Question Answering systems are 
evaluated both in monolingual and multilingual 
use (e.g. Voorhees, 2005; Vallin, 2005). 
Nevertheless, very few comparisons of 
performances took place between Question 
Answering systems and Information Retrieval 
engines (Kwok, 2001; Radev, 2002; Buccholz, 
2002; McGowan, 2005). If so, they mainly focus 
on the quality of the supplied answers and on the 
time for user to obtain the answer. 
We hereby attempt to define an evaluation 
method to compare performances and user-
friendliness of both Question Answering systems 
and Information Retrieval engines. We will 
apply this method to our system Qristal and to 
the Google Desktop Search1 engine..

2 Background 
2.1 Qristal pedigree 
Qristal (French acronym of "Questions-R?ponses 
Int?grant un Syst?me de Traitement Automatique 
des Langues", which can be translated by 
"Question Answering System using NLP") is, as 
far as we know, the first Multilingual Question 
Answering System available on the consumer 
market (B2C). It handles French, English, Italian, 
Portuguese or Polish.  
Qristal allows the user to query on a static 
corpus or on the Web. It supplies answers in one 
or any of the 4 languages.  
Our system is described in detail in other 
papers (Amaral, 2004; Laurent 2004; Laurent 
2005-1; Laurent 2005-2). Qristal is based on our 
Cordial syntactic analyzer and extensively uses 
all the usual constituents of the natural language 
processing, while, as seldom found, remarkably 
featuring anaphora resolution and metaphor 
detection. 
Originally developed within the framework of 
the European project TRUST2 and M-CAST3, 
our system has evolved, over the last five years, 
from a monolingual single-user program into a 
multilingual multi-user system. 
2.2 Qristal benchmarks and performances 
A beta version of Qristal was evaluated in July 
2004 in the EQueR4 evaluation campaign 
organized in France by several ministries 
(Ayache, 2004; Ayache, 2005). With a MRR 
("Mean Reciprocal Rank"; cf. Ayache, 2004) of 
0.58 for the exact answers and 0.70 for the 
snippets, our system ranked first out of the seven

Question Answering systems evaluated. 
The marketed version of Qristal was evaluated 
during the CLEF 2005 (Laurent, 2005-2) and 
obtained 64% of exact answers for French to 
French, 39.5% from English to French and 
36.5% from Portuguese to French. Once again, 
Qristal ranked first in this evaluation, for French 
engines and for all cross language systems, all 
pairs considered. 
Since this evaluation, the resources were 
increased and some algorithms revised, so our 
last tests brought us a 70% of exacted answers 
and 45 % for cross language. 
3 QA and IR 
It is true that, intrinsically, IR engines and QA 
systems differ in design, objectives and 
processes. An IR engine is geared to deliver 
snippets or docs from a query, a QA system 
strive to deliver the exact answer to a question. 
If one is to differentiate 3 key features of both 
systems, one of the first difference concerns the 
query mode : natural language for the QA 
systems and ?Boolean like? for the IR engines. 
We define ?Boolean like? extensively as the use 
of Boolean operators associated to underlying 
constraints induced by the word matching 
techniques. The table 1 gives the results of 
Google Desktop for natural language requests 
and Boolean requests (set of questions detailed 
below) and we can see that results with natural 
language requests are not so good:

Table 1. Results with Google Desktop Search on 
natural language and Boolean requests 
This performance table shows that classical 
engines are not suited to answer questions in 
natural language. To quote Google ?A Google 
search is an easy, honest and objective way to 
find high-quality websites with information 
relevant to your search.? 
The Google technology considers, at least in 
French, equally and of same ?weight, words like, 
"de" or "le" and the highly semantically-loaded 
words of the query. This leads to a dramatic 
upsurge of noise in their results. Therefore, using 
classic engines require a good knowledge of their 
syntax and their underlying word matching 
techniques, like the necessity of grouping 
between quotation marks, the ?noun phrases? 
and the expressions. 
The second difference concerns what is 
delivered to the user. Question Answering 
systems deliver one or more exact answers to a 
question and their context whereas classical 
engines return snippets with links to the texts 
those snippets were extracted from. 
The third difference relates to the dynamic and 
openness status of the corpora. Usually QA 
systems use confined or close corpora with low 
up-date rate, while classical IR engines are tuned 
to the Web queries and their reference file are 
continuously updated. 
Qristal QA is able to deliver answers from 
both web-based queries and closed corpora. We 
were eager to apply our proposed metrics on the 
web-based deliveries, but unfortunately, we had 
not at our disposal the appropriate web reference 
file of questions and answers, probably impossi-
ble to elaborate considering the extremely high 
up-dating rate of the web pages. 
Therefore we had but no choice to use a closed 
corpus, Google Desktop being able to manage 
this type of corpus (see note 1). We used the 
reference file of questions and answers 
established for EQueR. 
3.1 Question Answering systems 
Qristal interface mimics almost all the usual 
screen template of IR engine (see figure 2). It 
displays results in different languages, keeps the 
track or trace of the precedent requests, allows 
the user to choose the requested corpus and, if 
thought necessary, to make a semantic 
disambiguation of the question terms. 
 
Figure 2. QRISTAL 
Results (answer, sentences, links) are display-
ed at three levels: if an exact answer is found, it

is displayed in the top right part of the window, 
sentences in the lower right part of the window 
and links on top of the sentences. Note that the 
words or phrases supporting the inferred answer 
are put in bold in the text. These words are 
sometimes pronouns (anaphora) and, frequently, 
synonyms or derivate forms of the request words. 
3.2 Information Retrieval engines 
Numerous Information Retrieval engines are 
available for closed or web-based corpora. 
For our evaluation we selected the Google 
engine, as it is available both for a web and 
closed PC desktop usage (in version "Desktop 
Search"), although, regrettably, this beta version 
had a few minor defects. The snippets supplied 
by Google are generally fragments of sentences, 
sometimes with cut words, stemming from 
excerpts of text seeming to correspond the best to 
the query. All you can expect is a help in the 
selection of the text(s) in which is likely to be 
present the answer to your query rather than a 
pinpointed and elaborated exact answer. 
3.3 Evaluation method of the performances 
Corpus of requests and answers 
The corpus selected for this evaluation is the 
corpus used for the EQueR evaluation campaign. 
This choice was justified by the size of the 
corpus (over half million texts for about 1.5 Gb) 
and, especially, by the fact that we have an 
important corpus of questions (500) with many 
answers and references for all these questions.  
To generate a comprehensive package of tests 
of Question Answering systems, ELDA, 
organizer of the EQueR campaign, made a 
compilation of all the results returned by all the 
participants. Then, thanks to a thorough 
examination by several specialists (one of whom 
being an author of this paper), this corpus has 
been verified, increased and validated. In doing 
so, most certainly, the immense majority of the 
possible answers are inventoried, the great 
majority of the references of these answers is 
known5 to the extent that this corpus of questions 
and answers can be automatically run, the results 
subsequently requiring only a reduced amount of 
checking. 
The initial corpus of 500 questions has been 
reduced to 330 questions for this evaluation. In 
                                                
5
 a set comprising textual corpora, questions and 
answers is available at ELDA (http://www.elda.org/ 
article139.html) 
fact, the last 100 questions were only 
reformulations of previous questions and offered 
not enough interest. 30 questions concerned 
binary answers YES/NO and 40 questions 
concerned lists as answers. As Information 
Retrieval engines are not able to return binary or 
list answers, including them within the 
evaluation would have biased it. Finally, five 
questions were without any answer. They were 
removed by the organizers of EQueR and we 
also did so accordingly. For these five ?no-
answer?questions, Qristal systematically returned 
correct answers i.e. NIL, where as a classical 
search engine like Google would systematically 
return at least one answer. We decided not to 
include these ?NIL? questions so as not further 
penalize the IR Google engine. 
Evaluation of the "user effort" 
We have two competing systems on the same 
corpora and a reference file with questions and 
answers. We need now to define the basis of 
their comparison. 
The main comparative evaluation between the 
Question Answering systems and the 
Information Retrieval engines (Kwok, 2001) 
considered only the reading time while counting 
characters to be read to reach the answer. 
Knowing the delay needed to obtain the results in 
most Question Answering systems (McGowan, 
2005), it seems necessary to take also in account 
this delay if we want to measure the global user 
effort to obtain an answer to his question. 
We consider that the user wants a correct 
answer to his question and we consider that the 
answer is correct if this answer can be found in 
the snippet or in the text linked to the snippet for 
Google (to the sentence for Qristal). So we 
compared the quality of the systems as follows: 
percentage of correct answers ranked first, 
ranked within the five first, the ten first and the 
hundred first. We considered both the answer as 
part of the snippets or part or the snippets and 
documents. 
For the user, the quality of the answers 
returned, especially in the first results page, is 
paramount. But, we think another item has to be 
taken into account: the time needed to obtain the 
answer. This time is the compound of three 
elements: 
? the time to key in the question, 
? the delay before the results display, 
? the reading time of the snippets or 
sentences to reach a correct answer. 
EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA06
3
Addition of these three elements provides the 
measure of the "user effort". 
Time to key in the question 
This time is shorter for a ?Boolean like? 
engine. Typing a question in Qristal needs in 
average nine seconds more than with the query in 
Google. However it supposes that the user types 
the Boolean like request at the same speed than a 
natural language request. This implies that the 
user is very familiar with the Google syntax. For 
example the question 6: 
Quel ?ge a l'abb? Pierre ? 
will be converted into Google syntax by:  
"abb? Pierre" ans  
This Boolean request increases the probability 
to obtain the effective age, not only snippets with 
the words "?ge" and "abb? Pierre". Other 
example, the question 37: 
Quel ?v?nement a eu lieu le 27 d?cembre 1978 en 
Alg?rie ? 
will be converted into Google syntax: 
"27 d?cembre 1978" Alg?rie 
This Boolean request is needed either words 
like "?v?nement" or "avoir lieu" will bring out 
more noise than correct answers. 
So, we translated the complete list of question 
in the Google syntax in addition to the questions 
set in natural language. Compared results were 
shown on Table 1. 
To measure the time necessary to enter 
questions, we counted the number of characters 
typed (always inferior in Google) and multiplied 
this number by an average speed of 150 
characters by minute. We know that a 
professional typist types at a speed of 300 to 400 
characters per minute, so our chosen speed 
corresponds to a user keying in with two fingers. 
The following table gives the numbers of 
characters and the times for the two systems:  
 characters  mean time 
Qristal 49.1 19.6 seconds 
Google Desktop 27.2 10.9 seconds 
Table 3: mean time of question entering 
Delay to display the results 
This is the elapsed time between the click on 
the button "OK" and the display of the results. 
Note here that, strangely, Google Desktop has a 
response time distinctly bigger than the response 
time of Google on the Web, especially when the 
request contains a group of words between 
quotes. 
Reading time to reach one answer 
To fix a reading speed, we tested several 
users. An average speed of 40 characters by 
second (2 400 characters per minute, or also 400 
words per minute) seems a fair measure. It 
corresponds to a reader with a higher-education 
background, according to Richaudeau, 1977. 
While making these tests, we noted that, if the 
user knows the answer, the reading speed of both 
the snippets and texts would increase to 100 
characters per second (6 000 characters per 
minute, or 1 000 words per minute). Even if very 
few questions have an obvious answer, we 
decided to calculate the reading times with both 
speeds of 40 characters per second and 100 
characters per second. 
The speed of 100 characters per second will 
however be considered as a superior limit that 
favours clearly Google where the snippets, 
constituted by fragments of sentences, sometimes 
fragments of words, are more difficult and longer 
to read than the sentences returned by Qristal.

Not found 73.0 % 9.1 % 30. 0 % 1.5 % 
Table 4: Percentage of correct answers / 330 
Qristal returns an exact answer for nearly 70% 
of questions and a correct answer is returned as 
exact answer or in the first sentence for 82% of 
the 330 questions. This has to be compared with 
the 10% of answer found in first position by 
Google Desktop. If we consider the snippets and 
the documents, Qristal returns a correct answer 
in first rank for 86% of the questions and Google 
in more than 30%. 
These results give a clear advantage to the 
Question Answering system on the Information 
Retrieval engine. This superiority in quality 
exists also in quantity. Here is the table of user 
efforts to obtain a correct answer:

37.6 s 24.5 s 
Table 5: Mean times compared for the two systems 
(on 330 questions) 
It appears that the time to type down the question 
in Qristal is nearly 9 seconds longer than with 
Google. The elapsed time before display is 
similar. On the other hand, as Google gives a 
correct answer in a higher rank or in a document, 
not a snippet, the number of characters to be read 
before reaching an answer is finally more 
important. Finally, if we consider the average 
reading speed of 40 characters per second, 
Qristal needs in average 29 seconds against 73 
seconds, in other words the user effort to obtain a 
good answer is 2.5 times higher with Google 
than with Qristal. 
If we don't take into account the time to enter 
the question, Google requires a user effort 6 to 7 
time higher than Qristal to reach an answer. This 
comparison would be effective in the case of 
voice-based submitted query. In that case, the 
acquisition of the question would become more 
difficult according to the syntax of the Boolean 
engine ("open the quotes", "close the quotes"...) 
4.2 Evaluation on 231 questions 
Looking carefully at each answer returned by 
Google Desktop, we discovered that it ignored 
some texts or, more exactly, some parts of texts, 
especially the end of these texts. The help pages 
of this software point out this "bug" :  
However, if you're searching for a word within the file, 
please note that Google Desktop searches only about the 
first 10,000 words. In a few cases, Google Desktop may 
index slightly fewer words to save space in your search 
index and on your hard drive.6 
Of course this default impacted on the results and 
the comparisons. Thus, we decided, in a second 
iteration of this evaluation, to consider only the 
231 questions where Google Desktop found at

least one correct answer. Google Desktop found 
no answer with those 99 (330-231) removed 
questions for two main reasons. Firstly, as it 
doesn't manage a full indexation of documents. 
Secondly, as some complex questions like "why" 
or "how" questions often lead it to silence on this 
evaluation. 
This selection of 231 questions favours Google 
Desktop but it allows a more accurate 
comparison. Here are the results for those 231 
questions:

Not found  3.9 %  0.4 % 
Table 6: Number of answers and percentages / 231 
The corpus of 231 questions is thus "easier" 
than that of 325 questions. This confirms the 
score of Qristal for the exact answers: 73.6% 
versus 69.7%, and the score for the correct 
answer in first rank: 89.6% versus 81.8%. But 
the results of Google are of course better: 13.9% 
in the first snippet against 9.7%, 43.7% in the 
first snippet or the first document, against 30.6%.  
However the advantage of the QA system over 
the IR engine is clear in terms of quality, 
especially if we consider only the snippets. This 
advantage is also clear for the user effort, even if 
any of the answer not found by Qristal penalizes 
this system as the reading time of this question is 
the consolidation of all reading times of all the 
snippets displayed for this question!

The mean times of question entering and 
displaying results are nearly the same for those 
231 questions than for the 325 questions. But, 
because Google Desktop finds an answer to all 
questions, the reading time before a correct 
answer is, in that case, reduced for Google. 
The mean times of question entering and

231 questions than for the 325 questions. But, 
because Google Desktop finds an answer to all 
questions, the reading time before a correct 
answer is, in that case, reduced for Google. 
Finally, with an average reading speed of 40 
characters by second, the user effort is two times 
higher with Google Desktop than it is with 
Qristal. And if we don't take into account the 
time to type in the question, the user effort with 
Google is 6 times higher than with Qristal. 
Using the same presentation than Kwok, 2001, 
the following graph gives the compared results 
of the two systems. On Y-axis is the number of 
correct answers and in X-axis the number of 
characters read, for the 231 questions: 
 
Figure 8 : number of correct answers by characters 
The interest of Question Answering systems is 
particularly noticeable at the beginning of the 
graph, seeing that Qristal displays a correct 
answer as exact answer at the top of the screen in 
more than 70% of the questions while Google 
Desktop needs to read about 1000 characters in 
the snippets and in the documents to obtain a 
similar success rate. 
4.3 Comparison by type of question(s) 
The above statistics concern all types of queries. 
In fact, 25 questions wait a definition, the others 
being factual requests. The following table of the

two categories:

Table 9 : Percentages of answers by type of questions 
The only significant gap in these results is that 
Google provides better results for definitions 
(32% of correct answers in the first snippet 
against 12% for the factual questions). 
We also looked at the questions beginning by 
"comment" ("how"), but we excluded those 
beginning by "comment s'appelle" ("how is 
called") or "comment est mort" ("how did 
somebody die"), i.e. 16 questions (3, 50, 59, 90, 
93, 117, 148, 154, 165, 196, 199, 234, 247, 249, 
263, 295). The results are :

Not found 87.5 % 31.2 % 62.5 % 18.7 % 
Table 10: Percentage of correct answers for questions 
beginning by "comment" ("how") 
These results are not satisfying for any of the two 
systems but Qristal displays a correct answer in 9 
cases on 16, versus 0 for Google Desktop. This 
underlines that the Question Answering systems 
are more successful when the queries are not 
purely factual requests. Most certainly this could 
be caused by the fact that those questions require 
a deeper analysis. 
A closer examination of factual questions 
revealed that the most difficult questions for the 
Information Retrieval engines are the questions 
about location. For example Google Desktop

and the department (county) where is located 
Annemasse only at the 23rd rank. 
More generally, a search engine finds answers 
more easily when these answers contain the 
words of the query. For example, to the query 
252 ("? quelle peine fut condamn? Jean-Marie 
Villemin le 16 d?cembre 1993?" ["What was the 
sentence received by Jean-Marie Villemin on 16 
December 1993 ?"]), Google Desktop does not 
find any answer because the acceptable answers 
"cinq ans de prison" (five years of prison) or 
"cinq ann?es d'emprisonnement" (a five-year 
prison sentence) does not contain, in French, any 
word of the query. Similarly the search engine 
has many difficulties to display the development 
of acronyms like those of the question 141 ("Que 
signifie CGT?" ["What is the significance of 
CGT?"]), or of the question 319 ("Qu'est-ce que 
l'EEE?" ["What is EEE?"]). Because the answers 
are developments of these capital letters which 
are not so frequent, except when the acronym is 
rare, as in this case the acronym is often followed 
or preceded by his significance, like for the 
questions 327 ("Qu'est-ce que le Cermoc ?" 
["What is Cermoc?"]) or 330 ("Qu'est-ce que 
l'OACI ?" [What is OACI?"]). For these two 
questions, Google Desktop returns the correct 
answer in the first snippet. 
5 Perspectives 
The evaluation was designed in such fair way to 
take into account all the differences between the 
Information Retrieval engines and the Question 
Answering systems.  
We made all possible efforts not to favour the 
QA systems and avoid non equitable compari-
son. For example, the evaluation includes the 
requests to Google Desktop made with the most 
sophisticated achievable query syntax to generate 
a return of the best answers, knowing that if they 
were keyed in as for the natural language 
requests, their success rate would have dropped 
considerably (see Table 1). 
It is most unlikely that one is able to formulate 
queries in Boolean like style as quickly as in NL 
questions. Conversely, for a same given number 
of characters, reading Google snippets requires 
most likely far more time than reading complete 
NL sentences. However, despite all these 
metrical choices more favourable to the classical 
search engine, the Question Answering system 
obtains better results with regard to the quality of 
the answers and to the user effort. 
If we were able to compare the Web versions 
of Google and Qristal, the results would be 
probably different.  
First, because Qristal uses the search engines 
as a meta-engine without any indexation. Next, 
because GoogleWeb is really faster at displaying 
the results from the Web than Google Desktop. 
At last because the redundancy, due to the large 
volume of indexed pages on the Web, allows the 
implementation of some very successful 
techniques.  
For example it may happen that you find the 
questions in natural language followed by their 
answers inside Web pages and this in such a way 
that asking a request in natural language in 
Google, you can obtain sometimes a very 
pertinent answer. To the question "Pourquoi le 
ciel est bleu?" ("Why the sky is blue?") or to the 
question "Pourquoi la mer est bleue?" ("Why the 
sea is blue?"), Google Web returns in first rank 
snippets and documents very accurately. 
However the analysis of the documents and 
contained answers permit to the Question 
Answering systems to return more accurate 
answers. For example, with the request "capitale 
anglaise" ("English capital"), Google returns a 
lot of snippets containing the phrase "capitale 
anglaise" ("English capital") but not the word 
Londres or London in these snippets. In an 
Information Retrieval engine the answers are 
very often less justified by the context than it is 
the case with Question Answering systems. This 
is because the snippets group essentially words 
contained in the query. For example, to the 
question 26 ("Qui a ?crit Germinal?" ["Who 
wrote Germinal?"], converted in Google syntax 
by : "auteur Germinal" ["writer Germinal"]), the 
search engine returns "?mile Zola" in the second 
snippet but the snippet "L'exposition "Emile 
Zola, photographe" fait escale" (The exhibition 
"Emile Zola, photograph" stops at) would be 
considered as an answer out of its context and 
non receivable within a campaign like TREC, 
even if we can read in the text : "L'auteur de 
"Germinal", l'?crivain fran?ais Emile Zola 
(1840-1902), ?tait aussi un photographe de 
talent" ("The author of Germinal, the writer 
Emile Zola (1840-1902), was also a talented 
photograph"). We could almost say that the 
classical search engines return far better results 
when the user already knows the answer to his 
query. 
A complete compared benchmark and exhaustive 
evaluation of search engines and question 
answering systems needs to be made on the Web.

The evaluation method described above could be 
applied but, knowing the difficulty to validate a 
Web corpus of answers, specially the difficulty 
to keep it referentially constant, the effort to 
estimate the quality of the returned answers 
would be far much enormous than the one 
engaged for this evaluation on a closed corpus. 
6 Conclusion 
We described a metrical method to compare 
Question Answering systems and Information 
Retrieval engines on a hard disk-based corpus. 
Applied to our system Qristal and to the search 
engine Google Desktop, this method shows that 
the improvements due to question answering 
systems, especially in terms of user effort, are 
both qualitative and quantitative. Taking into 
account or not the query keying time, the 
question answering system is 2 to 6 times faster 
than the Information Retrieval engine. 
This evaluation, made almost automatically 
with the corpus EQueR, focuses mainly on 
factual or definition types of requests which 
defines the majority of the requests concerned in 
the QA system evaluation campaigns. On more 
complex questions, like those beginning by 
"comment" ("how..."), the QA systems obtained 
less satisfying results than for factual questions 
but, on this type of questions, the search engines 
like Google proved to be also less accurate. A 
more exhaustive and thorough study on these 
types of requests or on questions beginning by 
"pourquoi" ("why") would possibly confirm 
these results, although here only a few questions 
were of these types. 
At last, a similar metrics and applied evaluation 
remain to be endeavoured on a web-based corpus 
despite the entailing difficulties.
