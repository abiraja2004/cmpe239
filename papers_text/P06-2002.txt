Abstract
In this paper, we describe a rote extrac-
tor that learns patterns for finding seman-
tic relationships in unrestricted text, with
new procedures for pattern generalization
and scoring. These include the use of part-
of-speech tags to guide the generalization,
Named Entity categories inside the pat-
terns, an edit-distance-based pattern gen-
eralization algorithm, and a pattern accu-
racy calculation procedure based on eval-
uating the patterns on several test corpora.
In an evaluation with 14 entities, the sys-
tem attains a precision higher than 50% for
half of the relationships considered.
1 Introduction
Recently, there is an increasing interest in auto-
matically extracting structured information from
large corpora and, in particular, from the Web
(Craven et al, 1999). Because of the difficulty of
collecting annotated data, several procedures have
been described that can be trained on unannotated
textual corpora (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998;
Soderland, 1999; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005).
An interesting approach is that of rote extrac-
tors (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000;
Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), which look for
textual contexts that happen to convey a certain re-
lationship between two concepts.
In this paper, we describe some contributions
to the training of Rote extractors, including a pro-
cedure for generalizing the patterns, and a more
complex way of calculating their accuracy. We
first introduce the general structure of a rote ex-
tractor and its limitations. Next, we describe the
proposed modifications (Sections 2, 3 and 4) and
the evaluation performed (Section 5).
1.1 Rote extractors
According to the traditional definition of rote ex-
tractors (Mann and Yarowsky, 2005), they esti-
mate the probability of a relationship r(p, q) given
the surrounding contextA1pA2qA3. This is calcu-
lated, with a training corpus T , as the number of
times that two related elements r(x, y) from T ap-
pear with that same context A1xA2yA3, divided
by the total number of times that x appears in that
context together with any other word:
P (r(p, q)|A1pA2qA3) =
P
x,yr c(A1xA2yA3)
P
x,z c(A1xA2zA3)
(1)
x is called the hook, and y the target. In order
to train a Rote extractor from the web, this proce-
dure is usually followed (Ravichandran and Hovy,
2002):
1. Select a pair of related elements to be used
as seed. For instance, (Dickens,1812) for the
relationship birth year.
2. Submit the query Dickens AND 1812 to a
search engine, and download a number of
documents to build the training corpus.
3. Keep all the sentences containing both ele-
ments.
4. Extract the set of contexts between them and
identify repeated patterns. This may just be
the m characters to the left or to the right,
(Brin, 1998), the longest common substring
of several contexts (Agichtein and Gravano,
2000), or all substrings obtained with a suf-
fix tree constructor (Ravichandran and Hovy,
2002).
5. Download a separate corpus, called hook cor-
pus, containing just the hook (in the example,
Dickens).
6. Apply the previous patterns to the hook cor-
pus, calculate the precision of each pattern
9
in the following way: the number of times it
identifies a target related to the hook divided
by the total number of times the pattern ap-
pears.
7. Repeat the procedure for other examples of
the same relationship.
To illustrate this process, let us suppose that we
want to learn patterns to identify birth years. We
may start with the pair (Dickens, 1812). From the
downloaded corpus, we extract sentences such as
Dickens was born in 1812
Dickens (1812 - 1870) was an English writer
Dickens (1812 - 1870) wrote Oliver Twist
The system identifies that the contexts of the last
two sentences are very similar and chooses their
longest common substring to produce the follow-
ing patterns:
<hook> was born in <target>
<hook> ( <target> - 1870 )
In order to measure the precision of the ex-
tracted patterns, a new corpus is downloaded us-
ing the hook Dickens as the only query word, and
the system looks for appearances of the patterns
in the corpus. For every occurrence in which the
hook of the relationship is Dickens, if the target
is 1812 it will be deemed correct, and otherwise
it will be deemed incorrect (e.g. in Dickens was
born in Portsmouth).
1.2 Limitations and new proposal
We have identified the following limitations in this
algorithm: firstly, to our knowledge, no Rote ex-
tractor allows for the insertion of wildcards (e.g.
*) in the extracted patterns. Ravichandran and
Hovy (2002) have noted that this might be dan-
gerous if the wildcard matches unrestrictedly in-
correct sentences. However, we believe that the
precision estimation that is performed at the last
step of the algorithm, using the hook corpus, may
be used to rule out the dangerous wildcards while
keeping the useful ones.
Secondly, we believe that the procedure for cal-
culating the precision of the patterns may be some-
what unreliable in a few cases. For instance,
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) report the follow-
ing patterns for the relationships Inventor, Discov-
erer and Location:
Relation Prec. Pattern
Inventor 1.0 <target> ?s <hook> and
Inventor 1.0 that <target> ?s <hook>
Discoverer 0.91 of <target> ?s <hook>
Location 1.0 <target> ?s <hook>
In this case, it can be seen that the same pattern
(the genitive construction) may be used to indi-
cate several different relationships, apart from the
most common use indicating possession. How-
ever, they all receive very high precision values.
The reason is that the patterns are only evaluated
for the same hook for which they were extracted.
Let us suppose that we obtain the pattern for Loca-
tion using the pairs (New York, Chrysler Building).
The genitive construction can be extracted from
the context New York?s Chrysler Building. After-
ward, when evaluating it, only sentences contain-
ing <target>?s Chrysler Building are taken into
account, which makes it unlikely that the pattern
is expressing a relationship other than Location,
so the pattern will receive a high precision value.
For our purposes, however, we need to collect
patterns for several relations such as writer-book,
painter-picture, director-film, actor-film, and we
want to make sure that the obtained patterns are
only applicable to the desired relationship. Pat-
terns like <target> ?s <hook> are very likely to
be applicable to all of these relationships at the
same time, so we would like to be able to discard
them automatically.
Hence, we propose the following improvements
for a Rote extractor:
? A new pattern generalization procedure that
allows the inclusion of wildcards in the pat-
terns.
? The combination with Named Entity recogni-
tion, so people, locations, organizations and
dates are replaced by their entity type in the
patterns, in order to increase their degree of
generality. This is in line with Mann and
Yarowsky (2003)?s modification, consisting
in replacing all numbers in the patterns with
the symbol ####.
? A new precision calculation procedure, in a
way that the patterns obtained for a given re-
lationship are evaluated on the corpus for dif-
ferent relationships, in order to improve the
detection of over-general patterns.
2 Proposed pattern generalization
procedure
To begin with, for every appearance of a pair of
concepts, we extract a context around them. Next,
those contexts are generalized to obtain the parts
that are shared by several of them. The procedure
is detailed in the following subsections.

Figure 1: Example patterns extracted from the training corpus for each several kinds of relationships.
2.1 Context extraction procedure
After selecting the sentences for each pair of re-
lated words in the training set, these are pro-
cessed with a part-of-speech tagger and a module
for Named Entity Recognition and Classification
(NERC) that annotates people, organizations, lo-
cations, dates, relative temporal expressions and
numbers. Afterward, a context around the two
words in the pair is extracted, including (a) at most
five words to the left of the first word; (b) all the
words in between the pair words; (c) at most five
words to the right of the second word. The context
never jumps over sentence boundaries, which are
marked with the symbols BOS (Beginning of sen-
tence) and EOS (End of sentence). The two related
concepts are marked as <hook> and <target>.
Figure 1 shows several example contexts extracted
for the relationships birth year, birth place, writer-
book and capital-country.
Furthermore, for each of the entities in the re-
lationship, the system also stores in a separate file
the way in which they are annotated in the training
corpus: the sequences of part-of-speech tags of ev-
ery appearance, and the entity type (if marked as
such). So, for instance, typical PoS sequences for
names of authors are ?NNP?1 (surname) and ?NNP
NNP? (first name and surname). A typical entity
kind for an author is person.
2.2 Generalization pseudocode
In order to identify the portions in common be-
tween the patterns, and to generalize them, we ap-
ply the following pseudocode (Ruiz-Casado et al,
in press):
1All the PoS examples in this paper are done with Penn
Treebank labels (Marcus et al, 1993).
1. Store all the patterns in a set P .
2. Initialize a setR as an empty set.
3. While P is not empty,
(a) For each possible pair of patterns, cal-
culate the distance between them (de-
scribed in Section 2.3).
(b) Take the two patterns with the smallest
distance, pi and pj .
(c) Remove them from P , and add them to
R.
(d) Obtain the generalization of both, pg
(Section 2.4).
(e) If pg does not have a wildcard adjacent
to the hook or the target, add it to P .
4. ReturnR
At the end, R contains all the initial patterns
and those obtained while generalizing the previous
ones. The motivation for step (e) is that, if a pat-
tern contains a wildcard adjacent to either the hook
or the target, it will be impossible to know where
it starts or ends. For instance, when applying the
pattern <hook> wrote * <target> to a text, the
wildcard prevents the system from guessing where
the title of the book starts.
2.3 Edit distance calculation
So as to calculate the similarity between two pat-
terns, a slightly modified version of the dynamic
programming algorithm for edit-distance calcula-
tion (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) is used. The dis-
tance between two patterns A and B is defined as
the minimum number of changes (insertion, addi-
tion or replacement) that have to be done to the
first one in order to obtain the second one.
The calculation is carried on by filling a ma-
trix M, as shown in Figure 2 (left). At the same

is calculated, and D is the matrix indicating the choice that produced the minimal distance for each cell inM.
time that we calculate the edit distance matrix, it
is possible to fill in another matrix D, in which we
record which of the choices was selected at each
step: insertion, deletion, replacement or no edi-
tion. This will be used later to obtain the gener-
alized pattern. We have used the following four
characters:
? I means that it is necessary to insert a token
in the first pattern to obtain the second one.
? R means that it is necessary to remove a to-
ken.
? E means that the corresponding tokens are
equal, so no edition is required.
? U means that the corresponding tokens are
unequal, so a replacement has to be done.
Figure 2 shows an example for two patterns,
A and B, containing respectively 5 and 4 to-
kens. M(5, 4) has the value 2, indicating the dis-
tance between the two complete patterns. For in-
stance, the two editions would be replacing well
by classic and removing known.
2.4 Obtaining the generalized pattern
After calculating the edit distance between two
patterns A and B, we can use matrix D to obtain
a generalized pattern, which should maintain the
common tokens shared by them. The procedure
used is the following:
? Every time there is an insertion or a deletion,
the generalized pattern will contain a wild-
card, indicating that there may be anything in
between.
? Every time there is replacement, the general-
ized pattern will contain a disjunction of both
tokens.
? Finally, in the positions where there is no edit
operation, the token that is shared between
the two patterns is left unchanged.
The patterns in the example will produced the
generalized pattern
Wrote the well known novel
Wrote the classic novel
???????????
Wrote the well|classic * novel
The generalization of these two patterns pro-
duces one that can match a wide variety of sen-
tences, so we should always take care in order not
to over-generalize.
2.5 Considering part-of-speech tags and
Named Entities
If we consider the result in the previous example,
we can see that the disjunction has been made be-
tween an adverb and an adjective, while the other
adjective has been deleted. A more natural result,
with the same number of editing operations as the
previous one, would have been to delete the adverb
to obtain the following generalization:
Wrote the well known novel
Wrote the classic novel
???????????
Wrote the * known|classic novel
This is done taking into account part-of-speech
tags in the generalization process. In this way, the
edit distance has been modified so that a replace-
ment operation can only be done between words of
the same part-of-speech.2 Furthermore, replace-
ments are given an edit distance of 0. This favors
the choice of replacements with respect to dele-
tions and insertions. To illustrate this point, the
distance between known|classic/JJ and old/JJ
2Note that, although our tagger produces the very detailed
PennTreebank labels, we consider that all nouns (NN, NNS,
NNP and NNPS) belong to the same part-of-speech class, and
the same for adjectives, verbs and adverbs.

will be set to 0, because both tokens are adjectives.
In other words, the d function is redefined as:
d(A[i], B[j]) =

0 if PoS(A[i]) = PoS(B[j])
1 otherwise

Note that all the entities identified by the NERC
module will appear with a PoS tag of entity,
so it is possible to have a disjunction such as
location|organization/entity in a general-
ized pattern (See Figure 1).
3 Proposed pattern scoring procedure
As indicated above, if we measure the precision of
the patterns using a hook corpus-based approach,
the score may be inadvertently increased because
they are only evaluated using the same terms with
which they were extracted. The approach pro-
posed herein is to take advantage of the fact that
we are obtaining patterns for several relationships.
Thus, the hook corpora for some of the patterns
can be used also to identify errors done by other
patterns.
The input of the system now is not just a list
of related pairs, but a table including several rela-
tionships for the same entities. We may consider
it as mini-biographies as in Mann and Yarowsky
(2005)?s system. Table 1 shows a few rows in the
input table for the system. The cells for which
no data is provided have a default value of None,
which means that anything extracted for that cell
will be considered as incorrect.
Although this table can be written by hand, in
our experiments we have chosen to build it auto-
matically from the lists of related pairs. The sys-
tem receives the seed pairs for the relationships,
and mixes the information from all of them in a
single table. In this way, if Dickens appears in
the seed list for the birth year, death year, birth
place and writer-book relationships, four of the
cells in its row will be filled in with values, and
all the rest will be set to None. This is probably a
very strict evaluation, because, for all the cells for
which there was no value in any of the lists, any re-
sult obtained will be judged as incorrect. However,
the advantage is that we can study the behavior of
the system working with incomplete data.
The new procedure for calculating the patterns?
precisions is as follows:
1. For every relationship, and for every hook,
collect a hook corpus from the Internet.
2. Apply the patterns to all the hook corpora
collected. Whenever a pattern extracts a re-
lationship from a sentence,
? If the table does not contain a row for
the hook, ignore the result.
? If the extracted target appears in the cor-
responding cell in the table, consider it
correct.
? If that cell contained different values, or
None, consider it incorrect.
For instance, the pattern <target> ?s <hook>
extracted for director-film may find, in the Dick-
ens corpus, book titles. Because these titles do not
appear in the table as films directed by Dickens,
the pattern will be considered to have a low accu-
racy.
In this step, every pattern that did not apply at
least three times in the test corpora was discarded.
4 Pattern application
Finally, given a set of patterns for a particular
relation, the procedure for obtaining new pairs is
straightforward:
1. For any of the patterns,
2. For each sentence in the test corpus,
(a) Look for the left-hand-side context in
the sentence.
(b) Look for the middle context.
(c) Look for the right-hand-side context.
(d) Take the words in between, and check
that either the sequence of part-of-
speech tags or the entity type had been

tionship.
5 Evaluation and results
The procedure has been tested with 10 different
relationships. For each pair in each seed list, a
corpus with 500 documents has been collected us-
ing Google, from which the patterns are extracted.
Table 2 shows the number of patterns obtained. It
is interesting to see that for some relations, such as
birth-year or birth-place, more than one thousand
patterns have been reduced to a few. Table 3 shows
the patterns obtained for the relationship birth-
year. It can also be seen that some of the patterns
with good precision contain the wildcard *, which
helped extract the correct birth year in roughly 50
occasions. Specially of interest is the last pattern,
(/( HOOK TARGET )/)

cedure here indicated, but which would have ob-
tained an accuracy of 0.54 using the traditional
hook corpus approach. This is because in other
test corpora (e.g. in the one containing soccer
players and clubs) it is more frequent to find the
name of a person followed by a number that is not
his/her birth year, while that did not happen so of-
ten in the birth year test corpus.
For evaluating the patterns, a new test corpus
has been collected for fourteen entities not present
in the training corpora, again using Google. The
chosen entities are Robert de Niro and Natalie
Wood (actors), Isaac Asimov and Alfred Bester
(writers), Montevideo and Yaounde (capitals),
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Hosni Mubarak
(country presidents), Bernardo Bertolucci and
Federico Fellini (directors), Peter Paul Rubens and
Paul Gauguin (painters), and Jens Lehmann and
Thierry Henry (soccer players). Table 4 shows the
results obtained for each relationship.
We have observed that, for those relationships
in which the target does not belong to a Named
14
Entity type, it is common for the patterns to extract
additional words together with the right target. For
example, rather than extracting The Last Emperor,
the patterns may extract this title together with
its rating or its length, the title between quotes,
or phrases such as The classic The Last Emperor.
In the second column in the table, we measured
the percentage of times that a correct answer ap-
pears inside the extracted target, so these examples
would be considered correct. We call this metric
inclusion precision.
5.1 Comparison to related approaches
Although the above results are not comparable to
Mann and Yarowsky (2005), as the corpora used
are different, in most cases the precision is equal
or higher to that reported there. On the other hand,
we have rerun Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)?s
algorithm on our corpus. In order to assure a
fair comparison, their algorithm has been slightly
modified so it also takes into account the part-of-
speech sequences and entity types while extract-
ing the hooks and the targets during the rule ap-
plication. So, for instance, the relationship birth
date is only extracted between a hook tagged as
a person and a target tagged as either a date or
a number. The results are shown in Table 5. As
can be seen, our procedure seems to perform bet-
ter for all of the relations except birth place. It
is interesting to note that, as could be expected,
for those targets for which there is no entity type
defined (films, books and pictures), Ravichandran
and Hovy (2002)?s extracts many errors, because
it is not possible to apply the Named Entity Rec-
ognizer to clean up the results, and the accuracy
remains below 10%. On the other hand, that trend
does not seem to affect our system, which had
very poor results for painter-picture, but reason-
ably good for actor-film.
Other interesting case is that of birth places.
A manual observation of our generalized patterns
shows that they often contain disjunctions of verbs
such as that in (1), that detects not just the birth
place but also places where the person lived. In
this case, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)?s pat-
terns resulted more precise as they do not contain
disjunctions or wildcards.

the two others attained a low precision. Therefore,
it should be possible to improve the performance
of the system if, while training, we augment the
training corpora until the number of extracted pat-
terns exceeds a given threshold.

Extracting information using Machine Learning
algorithms has received much attention since the
nineties, mainly motivated by the Message Un-
derstanding Conferences (MUC6, 1995; MUC7,
1998). From the mid-nineties, there are systems
that learn extraction patterns from partially an-
notated and unannotated data (Huffman, 1995;
Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998;
Soderland, 1999).
Generalizing textual patterns (both manually
and automatically) for the identification of re-
lationships has been proposed since the early
nineties (Hearst, 1992), and it has been applied
to extending ontologies with hyperonymy and
holonymy relationships (Kietz et al, 2000; Cimi-
ano et al, 2004; Berland and Charniak, 1999),
with overall precision varying between 0.39 and
0.68. Finkelstein-Landau and Morin (1999) learn
patterns for company merging relationships with
exceedingly good accuracies (between 0.72 and
0.93).
Rote extraction systems from the web have
the advantage that the training corpora can be
collected easily and automatically. Several
similar approaches have been proposed (Brin,
1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichan-
dran and Hovy, 2002), with various applications:
Question-Answering (Ravichandran and Hovy,
2002), multi-document Named Entity Corefer-
ence (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), and generating
15
biographical information (Mann and Yarowsky,
2005).
7 Conclusions and future work
We have described here a new procedure for build-
ing a rote extractor from the web. Compared to
other similar approaches, it addresses several is-
sues: (a) it is able to generate generalized patterns
containing wildcards; (b) it makes use of PoS and
Named Entity tags during the generalization pro-
cess; and (c) several relationships are learned and
evaluated at the same time, in order to test each
one on the test corpora built for the others. The re-
sults, measured in terms of precision and inclusion
precision are very good in most of the cases.
Our system needs an input table, which may
seem more complicated to compile that the list of
related pairs used by previous approaches, but we
have seen that the table can be built automatically
from the lists, with no extra work. In any case,
the time to build the table is significantly smaller
than the time needed to write the extraction pat-
terns manually.
Concerning future work, we are currently trying
to improve the estimation of the patterns accuracy
for the pruning step. We also plan to apply the ob-
tained patterns in a system for automatically gen-
erating biographical knowledge bases from vari-
ous web corpora.
