Abstract
The ability to detect deceptive statements in
predatory communications can help in the iden-
tification of sexual predators, a type of deception
that is recently attracting the attention of the re-
search community. Due to the intention of a pe-
dophile of hiding his/her true identity (name, age,
gender and location) its detection is a challenge.
According to previous research, fixated discourse
is one of the main characteristics inherent to the
language of online sexual predation. In this pa-
per we approach this problem by computing sex-
related lexical chains spanning over the conversa-
tion. Our study shows a considerable variation in
the length of sex-related lexical chains according
to the nature of the corpus, which supports our
belief that this could be a valuable feature in an
automated pedophile detection system.
1 Introduction
Child sexual abuse is not a rare problem. The statisti-
cal analysis by the National Incident-Based Reporting
System data (FBI, 1995) revealed that in the majority
of all sexual assaults (67%) the victims were under-
age (Snyder, 2000). Child sexual abuse and pedophilia
are related to each other and both are of great social
concern. On the one hand, law enforcement is work-
ing on prosecuting and preventing child sexual abuse.
On the other hand, psychologists and mental special-
ists are investigating the phenomenon of pedophilia.
Even though pedophilia has been studied from differ-
ent research perspectives, it remains to be a very im-
portant problem that requires further research.
The widespread availability of the Internet, and the
anonymity enabled by it has brought about new forms
of crime. According to the research conducted by
Mitchell (2001), 19% of children have been sexually
approached over the Internet. However, only 10% of
such cases were reported to the police. Attempts to so-
licit children have become common in chat rooms, but
manual monitoring of each conversation is impossible,
due to the massive amount of data and privacy issues.
Therefore, development of reliable tools for detecting
pedophilia in social media is of great importance.
Another related issue is that Internet makes it very
easy to provide false personal information. There-
fore, many online sexual predators create false profiles
where they hide their identity and age. Thus, detec-
tion of online sexual predation also involves age and
gender detection in chats.
From the Natural Language Processing (NLP) per-
spective, there are additional challenges to this prob-
lem because of the chat data specificity. Chat conver-
sations are very different, not only from the written
text, but also from other types of Internet communi-
cation, such as blogs and forums. Since online chat-
ting usually involves very fast typing, mistakes, mis-
spellings, and abbreviations occur frequently in chats.
Moreover, specific slang (e.g. ?kewl? is used instead
of ?cool? and ?asl? stands for ?age/sex/location?) and
character flooding (e.g. greeeeeat!) are used. There-
fore, modern NLP tools often fail to provide accurate
processing of chat language.
Previous research on cyberpedophiles reports that
they often copy juveniles? behavior (Egan et al, 2011),
in particular, they often use colloquialisms and emoti-
cons. Other important characteristics reported previ-
ously include the unwillingness of the predator to step
out of the sex-related conversation, even if the poten-
tial victim wants to change the topic. This is called
fixated discourse (Egan et al, 2011). In this paper
we present preliminary experiments on modelling this
phenomenon. To approach the problem we apply lex-
ical chaining techniques. The experiments show the
difference in the length of sex-related lexical chains
between different datasets. We believe this fact could
be then utilized in detecting pedophiles.
The following section overviews related work on the
topic. Section 3 briefly describes previous research
on pedophiles, the language of online sexual preda-
tion and the fixated discourse phenomenon in partic-
ular. Our approach to modelling fixated discourse is
presented in Section 4. We describe the data set used
in the experiments in Section 5, followed by prelim-
inary experiments presented in Section 6. We finally
draw some conclusions and plans for future work in
Section 7.

2 Related Work
The problem of detecting pedophiles in social media
is difficult and relatively novel. New ways of meet-
ing new friends are offered: chatting with webcam
(http://chatroulette.com/) or picking another user at
random and let you have a one-on-one chat with each
other (http://omegle.com/) in a completely anonymous
way.
Some chat conversations with online sexual preda-
tors are available at www.perverted-justice.com. The
site is run by adult volunteers who enter chat rooms
as juveniles (usually 12-15 year old) and if they are
sexually solicited by adults, they work with the po-
lice to prosecute this. Related to the problem of pe-
dophile detection in social media, a study of Perverted
Justice Foundation revealed that since 2007, they have
been working on identifying sex offenders on Myspace
and in 2008, they expanded that effort to Facebook.
The results are sadly staggering in terms of sex of-
fenders that have misused the two social media: Mys-
pace (period 2007- 2010) and Facebook (2008-2010)
deleted respectively 10,746 and 2,800 known sex of-
fenders. Although both social media have been helpful
and responsive towards removing danger users from
their communities, an automatic identification of sex
offenders would certainly help and make the process
faster.
Only few attempts to automatic detection of on-
line sexual predation have been done. Pendar (2007)
proved that it is possible to distinguish between preda-
tor and pseudo-victim with quite high accuracy. The
experiments were conducted on perverted-justice data.
The authors used a kNN classifier to distinguish be-
tween lines written by predators and the lines posted
by pseudo-victims. As features they used word uni-
grams, bigrams and trigrams.
Another attempt has been done by McGhee et al
(2011). They manually annotated the chat lines from
perverted-justice.com with the following labels:
1. Exchange of personal information
2. Grooming
3. Approach
4. None of the above listed classes
In order to distinguish between these types of lines
they used both a rule-based and a machine learn-
ing (kNN) classification approach. Their experiments
showed that the machine learning approach provides
better results and achieves up to 83% accuracy.
Another research work closely related to detection
of cyberpedophilia has been carried by Peersman et
al. (?). As it was already mentioned, pedophiles often
create false profiles and pretend to be younger or of
another gender. Moreover, they try to copy children?s
behaviour. Therefore, there is a need to detect age and
gender in chat conversation. Peersman et al (?) have
analyzed chats from Belgium Netlog social network.
Discrimination between those who are older than 16
from those who are younger based on Support Vector
Machine classification yields 71.3% accuracy. The ac-
curacy is even higher with increasing the gap between
the age groups (e.g. the accuracy of classifying those
who are less than 16 from those who are older than
25 is 88.2%). They have also investigated the issues of
the minimum required dataset. Their experiments have
shown that with 50% of the original dataset the accu-
racy remains almost the same and with only 10% it is
still much better than random baseline performance.
3 Profiling the Pedophile
Pedophilia is a ?disorder of adult personality and be-
haviour? which is characterized by sexual interest in
prepubescent children (International statistical classifi-
cation of diseases and related health problems, 1988).
Even though solicitation of children is not a medi-
cal diagnosis, Abel and Harlow (2001) reported that
88% of child sexual abuse cases are committed by pe-
dophiles. Therefore, we believe that understanding be-
haviour of pedophiles could help detecting and pre-
venting online sexual predation. Even though online
sexual offender is not always a pedophile, in this paper
we use these terms as synonyms.
3.1 Predator?s Linguistic Behavior
The language sexual offenders use was analyzed by
Egan et al (2011). The authors considered the chats
published at www.perverted-justice.com. The analysis
of the chats revealed several characteristics of preda-
tors? language:
? Fixated discourse. Predators impose a sex-related
topic on the conversation and dismiss attempts
from the pseudo-victim to switch topics.
? Implicit/explicit content. On the one hand, preda-
tors shift gradually to the sexual conversation,
starting with more ordinary compliments. On the
other hand, conversation then becomes overtly re-
lated to sex. They do not hide their intentions.
? Offenders often understand that what they are do-
ing is not moral.
? They transfer responsibility to the victim.
? Predators often behave as children, copying the
language: colloquialisms often appear in their
messages.
? They try to minimize the risk of being prosecuted:
they ask to delete chat logs and warn victims not
to tell anyone about the talk, though they finally
stop being cautious and insist on meeting offline.
87
In this paper we consider only the first charac-
teristic: fixated discourse. The conversation below,
taken from perverted-justice.com, illustrates fixated
discourse: the predator almost ignores what the victim
says and comes back to the sex-related conversation:
Predator: licking dont hurt
Predator: its like u lick ice cream
Pseudo-victim: do u care that im 13 in march
and not yet? i lied a little bit b4
Predator: its all cool
Predator: i can lick hard
4 Our Approach
We believe that lexical chains are appropriate to model
the fixated discourse of the predators chats.
4.1 Lexical Chains
A lexical chain is a sequence of semantically related
terms (Morris and Hirst, 1991). It has applications
in many tasks including Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) (Galley and McKeown, 2003) and Text Sum-
marization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).
To estimate semantic similarity we used
two metrics: the similarity of Leacock and
Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003), and that
of Resnik (Resnik, 1995). Leacock and Chodorow?s
semantic similarity measure is defined as:
SimL&Ch(c1, c2) = ?log
length(c1, c2)
2 ? depth
where length(c1, c2) is the length of the shortest path
between the concepts c1 and c2 and depth is depth of
the taxonomy.
The semantic similarity measure that was proposed
by Resnik (Resnik, 1995) relies on the Information
Content concept:
IC(c) = ?logP (c)
where P(c) is the probability of encountering the
concept c in a large corpus. Thus, Resnik?s similarity
measure is defined as follows:
SimResnik(c1, c2) = IC(lcs(c1, c2))
where lcs(c1, c2) is the least common subsumer of
c1 and c2.
4.2 Modelling Fixated Discourse
To model the fixated discourse phenomenon, we esti-
mate the length of the longest sex-related lexical chain
in a text. In particular, we start the construction of a
chain with an anchor word ?sex? in the first WordNet
meaning: ?sexual activity, sexual practice, sex, sex ac-
tivity (activities associated with sexual intercourse)?.
Then we continue the chain construction process until
the end of the text. We compare the relative lengths (in
percentage to the total number of words) of the con-
structed chains: we believe that the presence of a long
sex-related lexical chain in a text indicates fixated dis-
course.
5 Data
Pendar (2007) has summarized the possible types of
chat interactions with sexually explicit content:
1. Predator/Other
(a) Predator/Victim (victim is underage)
(b) Predator/Volunteer posing as a children
(c) Predator/Law enforcement officer posing as
a child
2. Adult/Adult (consensual relationship)
The most interesting from our research point of view
is data of the type 1(a), but obtaining such data is not
easy. However, the data of type 1(b) is freely avail-
able at the web site www.perverted-justice.com (PJ).
For our study, we have extracted chat logs from the
perverted-justice website. Since the victim is not real,
we considered only the chat lines written by predators.
As the negative dataset, we need data of type 2.
Therefore, we have downloaded cybersex chat logs
available at www.oocities.org/urgrl21f/. The archive
contains 34 one-on-one cybersex logs. We have sep-
arated lines of different authors, thereby obtaining 68
files.
We have also used a subset of the NPS chat cor-
pus (Forsythand and Martell, 2007), though it is not
of type 2, we believe it will make a good comparison.
We have extracted chat lines only for those adult au-
thors who had more than 30 lines written. Finally the
NPS dataset consisted of 65 authors.
6 Experiments
We carried out preliminary experiments on estimating
the length of lexical chains with sexually related con-
tent in PJ chats, and compare our results with the cor-
pora described above. Our goal is to explore the fea-
sibility of including fixated discourse as a feature in
pedophile detection.
We used Java WordNet Similarity library (Hope,
2008), which is a Java implementation of Perl Word-
net:Similarity (Pedersen et al, 2008). The average
length of the longest lexical chains (with respect to the
total number of words in a document) found for dif-
ferent corpora are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.
As we expected, sex-related lexical chains in the NPS
corpus are much shorter regardless of the similarity
metric used. The chains in the cybersex corpus are
even longer than in PJ corpus. This is probably due

to the fact that whilst both corpora contain conver-
sations about sex, cyberpedophiles are switching to
this topic gradually, whereas cybersex logs are entirely
sex-related.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
Detection of online sexual predation is a problem of
great importance. In this small scale study we have
focused on modelling fixated discourse using lexical
chains as a potential feature in the automated detec-
tion of online sex predators. The preliminary experi-
ments revealed that the lengths of sex-related lexical
chains vary with the nature of the corpus, with the pe-
dophiles logs having longer lexical chains than chat
logs not related to sex, while the cybersex chat logs
had the longest sex-related lexical chains of the three
corpora.
As it was mentioned in Section 1, chat language
is very informal and has a lot of abbreviations, slang
words, mistakes etc. Hence a fair amount of words
used there do not appear in WordNet and, therefore,
can not be included into the lexical chains. For exam-
ple, the word ?ssex? is obviously related and should
appear in the chain, though because of the different
spelling it is not found in WordNet and, therefore, is
not included into the chain. We plan to add a normal-
ization step prior to computing lexical chains. We have
used only one anchor word (?sex?) to start the lexical
chain. But several other words could also be good can-
didate for this.
Fixated discourse is not only about keeping the sex-
ual topic throughout all the conversation, it is also
about unwillingness to step out of the sexual conver-
sation and ignoring victim?s attempts to do it. There-
fore, the chat lines of the pseudo-victim should be an-

Leacock and Chodorow semantic similarity

Resnik semantic similarity
alyzed as well in order to find out if there were failed
attempts to switch the topic. This may also help to dis-
tinguish predation from cybersex conversation, since
in the cybersex conversation both participants want to
follow the topic. However, during this preliminary ex-
periments we have not yet considered this. Moreover,
perverted-justice is run by volunteers posing as poten-
tial victims. It is then possible that the volunteers? be-
havior differ from the responses of real children (Egan
et al, 2011). Their goal is to build a legal case against
the pedophile and, therefore, they are more willing to
provoke the predator than to avoid sex-related conver-
sation.
Another way to distinguish cybersex fixed topic
from the predator?s unwillingness to step out of it is
could be to use emotion classification based on the
Leary Rose model proposed by Vaassen and Daele-
mans (Vaassen and Daelemans, 2011). Their approach
is based on Interpersonal Circumplex suggested by
Leary (Leary, 1957). This is a model of interpersonal
communication that reflects whether one of the par-
ticipants is dominant and whether the participants are
cooperative. It was already mentioned that cyberpe-
dophiles tend to be dominant. Therefore, we believe
that the Leary Rose model can be useful in detecting
online sexual predation.

Once the model of fixated discourse is improved,
we plan to use it as an additional feature to detect pe-
dophiles in social media.
