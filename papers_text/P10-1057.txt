Abstract
Identifying background (context) informa-
tion in scientific articles can help schol-
ars understand major contributions in their
research area more easily. In this paper,
we propose a general framework based
on probabilistic inference to extract such
context information from scientific papers.
We model the sentences in an article and
their lexical similarities as a Markov Ran-
dom Field tuned to detect the patterns that
context data create, and employ a Belief
Propagation mechanism to detect likely
context sentences. We also address the
problem of generating surveys of scien-
tific papers. Our experiments show greater
pyramid scores for surveys generated us-
ing such context information rather than
citation sentences alone.
1 Introduction
In scientific literature, scholars use citations to re-
fer to external sources. These secondary sources
are essential in comprehending the new research.
Previous work has shown the importance of cita-
tions in scientific domains and indicated that ci-
tations include survey-worthy information (Sid-
dharthan and Teufel, 2007; Elkiss et al, 2008;
Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Mohammad et al,
2009; Mei and Zhai, 2008).
A citation to a paper in a scientific article may
contain explicit information about the cited re-
search. The following example is an excerpt from
a CoNLL paper1 that contains information about
Eisner?s work on bottom-up parsers and the notion
of span in parsing:
?Another use of bottom-up is due to Eisner
(1996), who introduced the notion of a span.?
1Buchholz and Marsi ?CoNLL-X Shared Task On Multi-
lingual Dependency Parsing?, CoNLL 2006
However, the citation to a paper may not always
include explicit information about the cited paper:
?This approach is one of those described in Eis-
ner (1996)?
Although this sentence alone does not provide any
information about the cited paper, it suggests that
its surrounding sentences describe the proposed
approach in Eisner?s paper:
?... In an all pairs approach, every possible
pair of two tokens in a sentence is considered
and some score is assigned to the possibility of
this pair having a (directed) dependency rela-
tion. Using that information as building blocks,
the parser then searches for the best parse for
the sentence. This approach is one of those de-
scribed in Eisner (1996).?
We refer to such implicit citations that contain
information about a specific secondary source but
do not explicitly cite it, as sentences with con-
text information or context sentences for short.
We look at the patterns that such sentences cre-
ate and observe that context sentences occur with-
ing a small neighborhood of explicit citations. We
also discuss the problem of extracting context sen-
tences for a source-reference article pair. We pro-
pose a general framework that looks at each sen-
tence as a random variable whose value deter-
mines its state about the target paper. In summary,
our proposed model is based on the probabilistic
inference of these random variables using graphi-
cal models. Finally we give evidence on how such
sentences can help us produce better surveys of re-
search areas. The rest of this paper is organized as
follows. Preceded by a review of prior work in
Section 2, we explain the data collection and our
annotation process in Section 3. Section 4 explains
our methodology and is followed by experimental
setup in Section 5.

2 Prior Work
Analyzing the structure of scientific articles and
their relations has received a lot of attention re-
cently. The structure of citation and collaboration
networks has been studied in (Teufel et al, 2006;
Newman, 2001), and summarization of scientific
documents is discussed in (Teufel and Moens,
2002). In addition, there is some previous work
on the importance of citation sentences. Elkiss et
al, (Elkiss et al, 2008) perform a large-scale study
on citations in the free PubMed Central (PMC)
and show that they contain information that may
not be present in abstracts. In other work, Nanba
et al (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Nanba et al,
2004b; Nanba et al, 2004a) analyze citation sen-
tences and automatically categorize them in order
to build a tool for survey generation.
The text of scientific citations has been used in
previous research. Bradshaw (Bradshaw, 2002;
Bradshaw, 2003) uses citations to determine the
content of articles. Similarly, the text of cita-
tion sentences has been directly used to produce
summaries of scientific papers in (Qazvinian and
Radev, 2008; Mei and Zhai, 2008; Mohammad
et al, 2009). Determining the scientific attribu-
tion of an article has also been studied before.
Siddharthan and Teufel (Siddharthan and Teufel,
2007; Teufel, 2005) categorize sentences accord-
ing to their role in the author?s argument into pre-
defined classes: Own, Other, Background, Tex-
tual, Aim, Basis, Contrast.
Little work has been done on automatic cita-
tion extraction from research papers. Kaplan et
al, (Kaplan et al, 2009) introduces ?citation-site?
as a block of text in which the cited text is dis-
cussed. The mentioned work uses a machine
learning method for extracting citations from re-
search papers and evaluates the result using 4 an-
notated articles.
In our work we use graphical models to ex-
tract context sentences. Graphical models have
a number of properties and corresponding tech-
niques and have been used before on Information
Retrieval tasks. Romanello et al (Romanello et
al., 2009) use Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
to extract references from unstructured text in dig-
ital libraries of classic texts. Similar work include
term dependency extraction (Metzler and Croft,
2005), query expansion (Metzler and Croft, 2007),
and automatic feature selection (Metzler, 2007).
3 Data
The ACL Anthology Network (AAN)2 is a col-
lection of papers from the ACL Anthology3 pub-
lished in the Computational Linguistics journal
and proceedings from ACL conferences and work-
shops and includes more than 14, 000 papers over
a period of four decades (Radev et al, 2009).
AAN includes the citation network of the papers
in the ACL Anthology. The papers in AAN are
publicly available in text format retrieved by an
OCR process from the original pdf files, and are
segmented into sentences.
To build a corpus for our experiments we picked
10 recently published papers from various areas
in NLP4, each of which had references for a to-
tal of 203 candidate paper-reference pairs. Table 1
lists these papers together with their authors, titles,
publication year, number of references, number of
references within AAN, and the number of sen-

work is applicable to any of the papers in AAN.

induction approaches.

extract templates of a limited form (in their case, determined by
the underlying information extraction application).
1 1 Like us (and unlike Lin and Pantel, who employ a single large
corpus), they use articles written about the same event in different
newspapers as data.

described: pattern comparison by analysis of the patterns respec-
tive arguments, and use of nonparallel corpora as a data source.
0 0 However, extraction methods are not easily extended to generation
methods.
1 1 One problem is that their templates often only match small frag-
ments of a sentence.
1 1 While this is appropriate for other applications, deciding whether
to use a given template to generate a paraphrase requires informa-
tion about the surrounding context provided by the entire sentence.

tences.
3.1 Annotation Process
We annotated the sentences in each paper from Ta-
ble 1. Each annotation instance in our setting cor-
responds to a paper-reference pair, and is a vec-
tor in which each dimension corresponds to a sen-
tence and is marked with a C if it explicitly cites
the reference, and with a 1 if it implicitly talks
about it. All other sentences are marked with 0s.
Table 2 shows a portion of two separate annota-
tion instances of N03-1003 corresponding to two
of its references. Our annotation has resulted in
203 annotation instances each corresponding to
one paper-reference pair. The goal of this work
is to automatically identify all context sentences,
which are marked as ?1?.
3.1.1 Inter-judge Agreement
We also asked a neutral annotator5 to annotate
two of our datasets that are marked with ? in Ta-
ble 1. For each paper-reference pair, the annotator
was provided with a vector in which explicit cita-

tions were already marked with Cs. The annota-
tion guidelines instructed the annotator to look at
each explicit citation sentence, and read up to 15
sentences before and after, then mark context sen-
tences around that sentence with 1s. Next, the 29
annotation instances done by the external annota-
tor were compared with the corresponding anno-
tations that we did, and the Kappa coefficient (?)
was calculated. The ? statistic is formulated as
? =
Pr(a)? Pr(e)
1? Pr(e)
where Pr(a) is the relative observed agreement
among raters, and Pr(e) is the probability that an-
notators agree by chance if each annotator is ran-
domly assigning categories. To calculate ?, we ig-
nored all explicit citations (since they were pro-
vided to the external annotator) and used the bi-
nary categories (i.e., 1 for context sentences, and
0 otherwise) for all other sentences. Table 3 shows
the annotation vector size (i.e., number of sen-
tences), number of annotation instances (i.e., num-
ber of references), and average ? for each set. The
average ? is above 0.85 in both cases, suggest-
ing that the annotation process has a low degree
of subjectivity and can be considered reliable.
3.2 Analysis
In this section we describe our analysis. First,
we look at the number of explicit citations each
reference has received in a paper. Figure 1 (a)
shows the histogram corresponding to this distri-
bution. It indicates that the majority of references
get cited in only 1 sentence in a scientific arti-
cle, while the maximum being 9 in our collected
dataset with only 1 instance (i.e., there is only 1
reference that gets cited 9 times in a paper). More-
over, the data exhibits a highly positive-skewed
distribution. This is illustrated on a log-log scale
in Figure 1 (b). This highly skewed distribution
indicates that the majority of references get cited
only once in a citing paper. The very small number
of citing sentences can not make a full inventory of
the contributions of the cited paper, and therefore,
extracting explicit citations alone without context

ent citations to each reference in a paper. (b) The

citations on a log-log scale.
Next, we investigate the distance between con-
text sentences and the closest citations. For each
context sentence, we find its distance to the clos-
ets context sentence or explicit citation. Formally,
we define the gap to be the number of sentences
between a context sentence (marked with 1) and
the closest context sentence or explicit citation
(marked with either C or 1) to it. For example,
the second column of Table 2 shows that there is a
gap of size 1 in the 9th sentence in the set of con-
text and citation sentences about Shinyama et al
(2002). Table 4 shows the distribution of gap sizes
in the annotated data. This observation suggests
that the majority of context sentences directly oc-
cur after or before a citation or another context
sentence. However, it shows that gaps between
sentences describing a cited paper actually exist,
and a proposed method should have the capability
to capture them.
4 Proposed Method
In this section we propose our methodology that
enables us to identify the context information of a
cited paper. Particularly, the task is to assign a bi-
nary label XC to each sentence Si from a paper S,
where XC = 1 shows a context sentence related
to a given cited paper, C. To solve this problem
we propose a systematic way to model the net-
work level relationship between consecutive sen-
tences. In summary, each sentence is represented
with a node and is given two scores (context, non-
context), and we update these scores to be in har-
mony with the neighbors? scores.
A particular class of graphical models known
as Markov Random Fields (MRFs) are suited for
solving inference problems with uncertainty in ob-
served data. The data is modeled as an undirected
graph with two types of nodes: hidden and ob-
served. Observed nodes represent values that are
known from the data. Each hidden node xu, cor-
responding to an observed node yu, represents the
true state underlying the observed value. The state
of a hidden node is related to the value of its cor-
responding observed node as well as the states of
its neighboring hidden nodes.
The local Markov property of an MRF indi-
cates that a variable is conditionally independent
on all other variables given its neighbors: xv ?
? xV \cl(v)|xne(v), where ne(v) is the set of neigh-
bors of v, and cl(v) = {v} ? ne(v) is the closed
neighborhood of v. Thus, the state of a node is as-
sumed to statistically depend only upon its hidden
node and each of its neighbors, and independent
of any other node in the graph given its neighbors.
Dependencies in an MRF are represented using
two functions: Compatibility function (?) and Po-
tential function (?). ?uv(xc, xd) shows the edge
potential of an edge between two nodes u, v of
classes xc and xd. Large values of ?uv would
indicate a strong association between xc and xd
at nodes u, v. The Potential function, ?i(xc, yc),
shows the statistical dependency between xc and
yc at each node i assumed by the MRF model.
In order to find the marginal probabilities of
xis in a MRF we can use Belief Propagation
(BP) (Yedidia et al, 2003). If we assume the yis
are fixed and show ?i(xi, yi) by ?i(xi), we can
find the joint probability distribution for unknown
variables xi as
p({x}) = 1
Z
?
ij
?ij(xi, xj)
?
i
?i(xi)
In the BP algorithm a set of new variables m is
introduced where mij(xj) is the message passed
from i to j about what state xj should be in. Each
message, mij(xj), is a vector with the same di-
mensionality of xj in which each dimension shows
i?s opinion about j being in the corresponding
class. Therefore each message could be consid-
ered as a probability distribution and its compo-
nents should sum up to 1. The final belief at a

rule. Elements that make up the message from a
node i to another node j: messages from i?s neigh-
bors, local evidence at i, and propagation function
between i, j summed over all possible states of
node i.
node i, in the BP algorithm, is also a vector with
the same dimensionality of messages, and is pro-
portional to the local evidence as well as all mes-
sages from the node?s neighbors:
bi(xi)? k?i(xi)
?
j?ne(i)
mji(xi) (1)
where k is the normalization factor of the be-
liefs about different classes. The message passed
from i to j is proportional to the propagation func-
tion between i, j, the local evidence at i, and all
messages sent to i from its neighbors except j:
mij(xj)?

Figure 2 illustrates the message update rule.
Convergence can be determined based on a va-
riety of criteria. It can occur when the maximum
change of any message between iteration steps is
less than some threshold. Convergence is guaran-
teed for trees but not for general graphs. However,
it typically occurs in practice (McGlohon et al,
2009). Upon convergence, belief scores are deter-
mined by Equation 1.
4.1 MRF construction
To find the sentences from a paper that form the
context information of a given cited paper, we
build an MRF in which a hidden node xi and
an observed node yi correspond to each sentence.
The structure of the graph associated with the
MRF is dependent upon the validity of a basic as-
sumption. This assumption indicates that the gen-
eration of a sentence (in form of its words) only

tences; (a) left, each sentence is independent on

depends on its surrounding sentences. Said dif-
ferently, each sentence is written independently of
all other sentences given a number of its neigh-
bors. This local dependence assumption can result
in a number of different MRFs, each built assum-
ing a dependency between a sentence and all sen-
tences within a particular distance. Figure 3 shows
the structure of the two MRFs at either extreme of
the local dependence assumption. In Figure 3 a,
each sentence only depends on one following and
one preceding sentence, while Figure 3 b shows
an MRF in which sentences are dependent on each
other regardless of their position. We refer to the
former by BP1, and to the latter by BPn. Gen-
erally, we use BPi to denote an MRF in which
each sentence is connected to i sentences before
and after.

Table 5: The compatibility function ? between
any two nodes in the MRFs from the sentences in
scientific papers
4.2 Compatibility Function
The compatibility function of an MRF represents
the association between the hidden node classes.
A node?s belief to be in class 1 is its probability to
be included in the context. The belief of a node i,
about its neighbor j to be in either classes is as-
sumed to be 0.5 if i is in class 0. In other words, if
a node is not part of the context itself, we assume
559
it has no effect on its neighbors? classes. In con-
trast, if i is in class 1 its belief about its neighbor
j is determined by their mutual lexical similarity.
If this similarity is close to 1 it indicates a stronger
tie between i, j. However, if i, j are not similar,
i?s probability of being in class 1, should not af-
fect that of j?s. To formalize this assumption we
use the sigmoid of the cosine similarity of two sen-
tences to build ?. More formally, we define S to
be
Sij =
1
1 + e?cosine(i,j)
The sigmoid function obtains a value of 0.5 for
a cosine of 0 indicating that there is no bias in the
association of the two sentences. The matrix in Ta-
ble 5 shows the compatibility function built based
on the above arguments.
4.3 Potential Function
The node potential function of an MRF can incor-
porate some other features observable from data.
Here, the goal is to find all sentences that are about
a specific cited paper, without having explicit cita-
tions. To build the node potential function of the
observed nodes, we use some sentence level fea-
tures. First, we use the explicit citation as an im-
portant feature of a sentence. This feature can af-
fect the belief of the corresponding hidden node,
which can in turn affect its neighbors? beliefs. For
a given paper-reference pair, we flag (with a 1)
each sentence that has an explicit citation to the
reference.
The second set of features that we are inter-
ested in are discourse-based features. In particu-
lar we match each sentence with specific patterns
and flag those that match. The first pattern is a bi-
gram in which the first term matches any of ?this;
that; those; these; his; her; their; such; previ-
ous?, and the second term matches any of ?work;
approach; system; method; technique; result; ex-
ample?. The second pattern includes all sentences
that start with ?this; such?.
Finally, the similarity of each sentence to the
reference is observable from the data and can be
used as a sentence-level feature. Intuitively, if a
sentence has higher similarity with the reference
paper, it should have a higher potential of being
in class 1 or C. The flag of each sentence here is
a value between 0 and 1 and is determined by its
cosine similarity to the reference. Once the flags
for each sentence, Si are determined, we calculate
normalized fi as the unweighted linear combina-
tion of individual features. Based on fis, we com-
pute the potential function, ?, as shown in Table 6.
?i(xc, yc) xc = 0 xc = 1
1? fi fi

5 Experiments
The intrinsic evaluation of our methodology
means to directly compare the output of our
method with the gold standards obtained from the
annotated data. Our methodology finds the sen-
tences that cite a reference implicitly. Therefore
the output of the inference method is a vector, ?,
of 1?s and 0?s, whereby a 1 at element i means
that sentence i in the source document is a con-
text sentence about the reference while a 0 means
an explicit citation or neither. The gold standard
for each paper-reference pair, ? (obtained from the
annotated vectors in Section 3.1 by changing all
Cs to 0s), is also a vector of the same format and
dimensionality.
Precision, recall, and F? for this task can be de-
fined as
p = ? ? ?
? ? 1 ; r =
? ? ?
? ? 1 ; F? =
(1 + ?2)p ? r
?2p + r (3)
where 1 is a vector of 1?s with the same dimen-
sionality and ? is a non-negative real number.
5.1 Baseline Methods
The first baseline that we use is an IR-based
method. This baseline, B1, takes explicit citations
as an input but use them to find context sentences.
Given a paper-reference pair, for each explicit ci-
tation sentence, marked with C, B1 picks its pre-
ceding and following sentences if their similarities
to that sentence is greater than a cutoff (the median
of all such similarities), and repeats this for neigh-
boring sentences of newly marked sentences. In-
tuitively, B1 tries to find the best chain (window)
around citing sentences.
As the second baseline, we use the hand-crafted
discourse based features used in MRF?s potential
function. Particularly, this baseline, B2, marks

each sentence that is within a particular distance
(4 in our experiments) of an explicit citation and
matches one of the two patterns mentioned in Sec-
tion 4.3. After marking all such sentences, B2
also marks all sentences between them and the
closest explicit citation, which is no farther than
4 sentences away. This baseline helps us under-
stand how effectively this sentence level feature
can work in the absence of other features and the
network structure.
Finally, we use a supervised method, SVM,
to classify sentences as context/non-context. We
use 4 features to train the SVM model. These
4 features comprise the 3 sentence level features
used in MRF?s potential function (i.e., similar-
ity to reference, explicit citation, matching certain
regular-expressions) and a network level feature:
distance to the closes explicit citation. For each
source paper, P , we use all other source papers
and their source-reference annotation instances to
train a model. We then use this model to clas-
sify all instances in P . Although the number of
references and thus source-reference pairs are dif-
ferent for different papers, this can be considered
similar to a 10-fold cross validation scheme, since
for each source paper the model is built using all
source-reference pairs of all other 9 papers.
We compare these baselines with 3 MRF-based
systems each with a different assumption about in-
dependence of sentences. BP1 denotes an MRF
in which each sentence is only connected to 1 sen-
tence before and after. In BP4 locality is more
relaxed and each sentence is connected to 4 sen-
tences on each sides. BPn denotes an MRF in
which all sentences are connected to each other
regardless of their position in the paper.
Table 7 shows F?=3 for our experiments and
shows how BP4 outperforms the other methods
on average. The value 4 may suggest the fact that
although sentences might be independent of dis-
tant sentences, they depend on more than one sen-
tence on each side.
The final experiment we do to intrinsically eval-
uate the MRF-base method is to compare differ-
ent sentence-level features. The first feature used
to build the potential function is explicit citations.
This feature does not directly affect context sen-
tences (i.e., it affects the marginal probability of
context sentences through the MRF network con-
nections). Therefore, we do not alter this fea-
ture in comparing different features. However, we
look at the effect of the second and the third fea-
tures: hand-crafted regular expression-based fea-
tures and similarity to the reference. For each pa-
per, we use BP4 to perform 3 experiments: two in
absence of each feature and one including all fea-
tures. Figure 4 shows the average F?=3 for each
experiment. This plot shows that the features lead
to better results when used together.
6 Impact on Survey Generation
We also performed an extrinsic evaluation of
our context extraction methodology. Here we
show how context sentences add important survey-
worthy information to explicit citations. Previous
work that generate surveys of scientific topics use
the text of citation sentences alone (Mohammad
et al, 2009; Qazvinian and Radev, 2008). Here,
we show how the surveys generated using citations
and their context sentences are better than those
generated using citation sentences alone.
We use the data from (Mohammad et al, 2009)

... Naturally, our current work on question answering for the reading comprehension task is most related to those of
(Hirschman et al , 1999; Charniak et al , 2000; Riloffand Thelen, 2000 ; Wang et al , 2000). In fact, all of this
body of work as well as ours are evaluated on the same set of test stories, and are developed (or trained) on the
same development set of stories. The work of (Hirschman et al , 1999) initiated this series of work, and it reported
an accuracy of 36.3% on answering the questions in the test stories. Subsequently, the work of (Riloffand Thelen ,
2000) and (Chaxniak et al , 2000) improved the accuracy further to 39.7% and 41%, respectively. However, all
of these three systems used handcrafted, deterministic rules and algorithms...
...The cross-model comparison showed that the performance ranking of these models was: U-SVM > PatternM
> S-SVM > Retrieval-M. Compared with retrieval-based [Yang et al 2003], pattern-based [Ravichandran et al 2002
and Soubbotin et al 2002], and deep NLP-based [Moldovan et al 2002, Hovy et al 2001; and Pasca et al 2001]
answer selection, machine learning techniques are more effective in constructing QA components from scratch. These
techniques suffer, however, from the problem of requiring an adequate number of handtagged question-answer
training pairs. It is too expensive and labor intensive to collect such training pairs for supervised machine
learning techniques ...
... As expected, the definition and person-bio answer types are covered well by these resources. The web has
been employed for pattern acquisition (Ravichandran et al , 2003), document retrieval (Dumais et al , 2002), query
expansion (Yang et al , 2003), structured information extraction, and answer validation (Magnini et al , 2002). Some
of these approaches enhance existing QA systems, while others simplify the question answering task, allowing a
less complex approach to find correct answers ...

that contains two sets of cited papers and corre-
sponding citing sentences, one on Question An-
swering (QA) with 10 papers and the other on De-
pendency Parsing (DP) with 16 papers. The QA
set contains two different sets of nuggets extracted
by experts respectively from paper abstracts and
citation sentences. The DP set includes nuggets
extracted only from citation sentences. We use
these nugget sets, which are provided in form of
regular expressions, to evaluate automatically gen-
erated summaries. To perform this experiment we
needed to build a new corpus that includes con-
text sentences. For each citation sentence, BP4 is
used on the citing paper to extract the proper con-
text. Here, we limit the context size to be 4 on
each side. That is, we attach to a citing sentence
any of its 4 preceding and following sentences if

AB nuggets 0.397 0.594

Table 9: Pyramid F?=3 scores of automatic
surveys of QA and DP data. The QA surveys
are evaluated using nuggets drawn from citation
texts (CT), or abstracts (AB), and DP surveys are
evaluated using nuggets from citation texts (CT).
BP4 marks them as context sentences. Therefore,
we build a new corpus in which each explicit ci-
tation sentence is replaced with the same sentence
attached to at most 4 sentence on each side.
After building the context corpus, we use
LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) to generate 2
QA and 2 DP surveys using the citation sentences
only, and the new context corpus explained above.
LexRank is a multidocument summarization sys-
tem, which first builds a cosine similarity graph of
all the candidate sentences. Once the network is
built, the system finds the most central sentences
by performing a random walk on the graph. We
limit these surveys to be of a maximum length of
1000 words. Table 8 shows a portion of the sur-
vey generated from the QA context corpus. This
example shows how context sentences add mean-
ingful and survey-worthy information along with
citation sentences. Table 9 shows the Pyramid
F?=3 score of automatic surveys of QA and DP

data. The QA surveys are evaluated using nuggets
drawn from citation texts (CT), or abstracts (AB),
and DP surveys are evaluated using nuggets from
citation texts (CT). In all evaluation instances the
surveys generated with the context corpora excel
at covering nuggets drawn from abstracts or cita-
tion sentences.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a framework based on
probabilistic inference to extract sentences that
appear in the scientific literature, and which are
about a secondary source, but which do not con-
tain explicit citations to that secondary source.
Our methodology is based on inference in an MRF
built using the similarity of sentences and their
lexical features. We show, by numerical exper-
iments, that an MRF in which each sentence is
connected to only a few adjacent sentences prop-
erly fits this problem. We also investigate the use-
fulness of such sentences in generating surveys of
scientific literature. Our experiments on generat-
ing surveys for Question Answering and Depen-
dency Parsing show how surveys generated using
such context information along with citation sen-
tences have higher quality than those built using
citations alone.
Generating fluent scientific surveys is difficult
in absence of sufficient background information.
Our future goal is to combine summarization
and bibliometric techniques towards building au-
tomatic surveys that employ context information
as an important part of the generated surveys.
