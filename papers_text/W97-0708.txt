The information to InClude m a summary 
vanes depending on the author's mtentmn 
and the use of the summary To create the 
best summaries, the appropriate goals of 
the extracting process should be set and a 
guide should be outlined that instructs the 
system how to meet the tasks 
The approach described m thin report m 
intended to be a basic archltecture to ex- 
tract a set of concme sentences that are in- 
dicated or predlcted by goals and contexts 
To evaluate a sentence, the sentence selec- 
tion algorithm simply measures the mfor- 
matlveness of each sentence by comparing 
with the determined goals, and the algo- 
rlthm extracts a set of the hlghest scored 
bentences by repeat apphcatmn of thin com- 
parmon 
Thin approach m apphed m the summary of 
newspaper artlcles The headhnes are used 
as the goals Also the method to extract 
charactenstlc sentences by using property 
mformatlon of text is shown 
In thls experiment m whlch Japanese news 
articles are  summarized, the sunlmarles 
consmt of about 30% of the original text 
On  avelage, thin method extracts 50% 
less text than the slmple tltle-keyword 
method 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Summaly requnements ( uch as length and content) 
vary widely, depending on from, subject, and situa- 
tion of use For example, even sevelal sentences may 
seem too long fol news reticles obtained from a net- 
wolk Snmlarly, as ~holt as possible summaries wall 
be desuable to preview sites in a web browsel, when 
a huge number of lesults are retrieved from search 
engmeo 
To extract a short summar} for this kind of pur- 
pose, an extract coveuug all topics in the text wall 
be too long Using small number of sentences to 
extrapolate the contents of the entlre text will be 
adequate for an efficlent prevmw To include the 
intended polnts and charactermtlc mformatmn m a 
short summary, the mechamsm to detect the pur- 
pose of the summary and select the sentences that 
match the goals m needed in the summanzatmn pro- 
cess  
In thin report, an algorithm that helps reahze such 
? a goal and context lnformatton oriented summanza- 
tmn system m described The algorithm evaluates 
the informativeness of each sentence m a text and 
selects a small number of sentences, mcludmg effec- 
tive mformatmn One of the apphcatmns of thin al- 
gorithm m shown in the expellment on the sentence 
extraction from the newspaper articles and market 
surveys The experimental system uses headhnes 
and htles as the goals of the sentence selection, and 
the lesults ale shorter and more effective than the 
simple tltle-keywold method (Pmce, 90) 
The results of the cmrent simple experiment are 
based on the word matching that as the goal pro- 
cessmg However, the experiments should include 
plocE, stag of the following structural goals, the con- 
cept level matching that uses the thesaurus, and the 
topic detection flora the text

system consists of a goal detection and sentence se- 
lectmn process by Informativeness evaluation 
The 'goal-directed' method may be sound over- 
stated, because the current experimental  system 
handles only the headhnes,' ht les and some text 
property expressions However, the 'goal-directed' } 
method is named, as the first step toward real|zing } 
a context based summarmatmn system

3 Sentence Selection Algorithm 
The sentence selectmn algonthm calculates the 'm- 
formahveness'  for each sentence m a document The 
measurement represents the strength of relatmn be- 
tween the goals, sentences, and the richness ofmfor- 
matron m a document These var|ables are defined 
by the following three numerical values 
1 Number of dtfferent sentence xpressmns related to 
the goals 
2 Total number of sentence xpressmns related to the 
goals 
3 Total number of sentence xpress|ons being not re- 
lated to the goals 
The order of these measurements defines their 
precedence The first measurement is given the high- 
est p rmnty  Sentences that sahsfy many of the goals 
are conmdered more mformahve Both the first and 
second values above represent he amount of tarot- 
matron included m a sentence The third measure- 
ment indicates the amount of mformatmn m a sen- 
tence and roughly simulates the contained amount 
of  explanation or descnpt!on about the goal 
The sentence select|on algorithm (shown m Fig- 
ure 2) relates the highest scored sentences by the in- 
formativeness measurement The measurements are 
repeatedly evaluated until all the goals are related 
to the sentences or all relatmns are found

hstmg of a document retneve system Thus, the 
contents of a document are unpredictable and the 
system needs to work m real time This hmltahon

These experiments are mostly of Japanese docu- 
ments Only a few results~ for Enghsh documents 
are avadable Table 3 hsts the results of the extract- 
mg summaries of Enghsh news articles In thin case, 
the extractmn rates are calculated based on the to- 
tal number of words 2 The nature of this system 
makes evaluating the contents dd~cult and no clear 
solutmn can be obtained 
The evaluation methods m (Salton and Allan, 93) 
and (Kuplec e ta  l ,  95) apphed to their system are 
using only intrinsic lnformatmn m a source text 
Salton measures the smnlar\]ty between a summary

words  $n  a t~t  
and an omgmal text Kuplec compares extracts with 
manually coded summaries If the priority of refor- 
mation of a text is equal and mformatweness can be 
Calculated umformly, these evaluations are statable 
However, a priority m affected by the context 
Detenmnmg the appropnatenees of the results 
was difficult Thus, the extracts were randomly cho- 
sen and the inappropriateness was analyzed for 87 
newspaper articles 11 market report articles 
Obvious errors were found m 17 summaries (16 
news articles, one report ) These errors were mainly 
caused by the fadure of synonyms .of the tltle- 
keywords and words m a sentence (e x ,  dead body, 
and corpse) to match The other summaries in- 
cluded enough reformation to extrapolate the con- 
tents of the or.lgmal texts Thus, 80% of  the sum- 
mattes contained enough reformation to serve as a 
preview 
In a news article, the leading paragraph should 
be a good summary of the article Therefore, the 
extracts of thin system and the lead paragraphs of 
news articles were compared Among all news ar- 
ticles, 70% of extracts from fins system included 
sentences from lead paragraphs and 50% of the ex- 
tracts included only the lead paragraphs Thus, the 
system algorithm naturally selected more sentences 
from lead paragraphs than other parts of a news ar- 
ticle 
Next, the appropriateness and compactness of the 
text between the lead paragraphs and extracts of 
tins system were compared the news data Inap- 
propriate results were found to be 4% higher m the 
extracts Double the number of extracts were more 
compact han the lead paragraph All of the report 
data of the extratlts were shorter than the leading 
paragraphs Thus, extracts from this system are re- 
garded as being better than leading paragraphs 
In the expemnent described above on news arti- 
cles, the goals were taken from the headlines and 
titles Also, some external source can serve as the 
goals of a summary If summaries are used to com- 
pare the text contents, text properties (such as tf  tdf 
scores) can be used to  create the goals of the sum- 
mary 
For example, the extracts wall include &stmctlve 
reformation \]f words with high tf ldf scores are gwen 
The extracts wall show the common mformatxon of 
text \]f words with high document frequencies are 
given Figure 3 shows the results of fins experiment 
using small number of the specfllcatlons documents 
of hard dmk drives 
As shown m Figure 3(a), the high tf \]df words de- 
terlmne the sentences describing the dmtmctlve fea- 
tures of the hard disk that are to be selected Figure 
3(b) shows that the words with high document fre- 
quencies are used to select the common reformation

6 Discuss ion 
This experiment only demonstrates a small part of 
goal-directed summarization. Many subjects still 
need to be tested 
1 Using of the thesaurus 
Most fmlures in processing news articles were 
caused by synonyms (such as 'corpse' and 'dead 
body', 'fishery' and 'fisherman') to be matched 
Most of these errors can be corrected by using 
the thesaurus 
2 Processing the structured goals 
To summarize structured documents (such as 
manuals) the hierarchical structure of the sec- 
tions and subsections can be used to create 
goals These goals may control the inheritance 
of sub-goals to be satisfied m the substructure 
(such as, the 'preface' section )
3 Resolving the anaphonc expression 
Fewer problems than the English sentence ex- 
trachon occurred, because Japanese text was 
mostly the subject of experiment and the text 
less contains the anaphonc expression 
However, person and company names In news 
articles are often abbreviated and shortened 
Resolving these, abbreviated and shortened ex- 
presslons are needed to Increase readablhty 
4 Control of the summary length 
Because the mare purpose of this system is to 
offer concme information for prevlewmg docu- 
ment contents, the length of output cannot be 
directly controlled If the length needs to be 
varmd, some methods to extend the results may 
be added as post-pr0cessing The method to 
find sentence relations (such as leeyacal cohesion) 
may be suitable to find sentence chmns with re- 
lated topics 
5 Evaluation method 
The evaluation of extracts cannot be simply de- 
fined Extracts cannot be evaluated without 
context For objective evaluation, measuring 
the effect (e x, the time of prrevlewmg) may be 
realistic 
7 Conclus ion 
This report is about the sentence xtraction experi- 
ment using the 'informativeness' evaluation method 
The evaluation of the extracted summaries shows the 
system selects maller sets of sentences than the sim- 
ple title-keyword method without losing reformation 
content Enough Information is extracted for pre- 
viewing document contents 
The cu~ent system may be too simple to be re- 
garded as a 'goal directed' However, this exper- 
iment shows, the efficiency of the generated sum- 
maries is improved, even when a snnple words list 
IS used as the goal of the selection process m the 
system
