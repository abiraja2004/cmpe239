Abstract
We present a method we used for the quality
estimation shared task of WMT 2012 involving
IBM1 and language model scores calculated
on morphemes and POS tags. The IBM1 scores
calculated on morphemes and POS-4grams of
the source sentence and obtained translation
output are shown to be competitive with the
classic evaluation metrics for ranking of trans-
lation systems. Since these scores do not re-
quire any reference translations, they can be
used as features for the quality estimation task
presenting a connection between the source
language and the obtained target language. In
addition, target language model scores of mor-
phemes and POS tags are investigated as esti-
mates for the obtained target language quality.
1 Introduction
Automatic quality estimation is a topic of increas-
ing interest in machine translation. Different from
evaluation task, quality estimation does not rely on
any reference translations ? it relies only on infor-
mation about the input source text, obtained target
language text, and translation process. Being a new
topic, it still does not have well established base-
lines, datasets or standard evaluation metrics. The
usual approach is to use a set of features which are
used to train a classifier in order to assign a predic-
tion score to each sentence.
In this work, we propose a set of features based
on the morphological and syntactic properties of in-
volved languages thus abstracting away from word
surface particularities (such as vocabulary and do-
main). This approach is shown to be very useful for
evaluation task (Popovic?, 2011; Popovic? et al., 2011;
Callison-Burch et al., 2011). The features investi-
gated in this work are based on the language model
(LM) scores and on the IBM1 lexicon scores (Brown
et al., 1993).
The inclusion of IBM1 scores in translation sys-
tems has shown experimentally to improve transla-
tion quality (Och et al., 2003). They also have been
used for confidence estimation for machine transla-
tion (Blatz et al., 2003). The IBM1 scores calcu-
lated on morphemes and POS-4grams are shown to
be competitive with the classic evaluation metrics
based on comparison with given reference transla-
tions (Popovic? et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al.,
2011). To the best of our knowledge, these scores
have not yet been used for translation quality esti-
mation. The LM scores of words and POS tags are
used for quality estimation in previous work (Spe-
cia et al., 2009), and in our work we investigate the
scores calculated on morphemes and POS tags.
At this point, only preliminary experiments have
been carried out in order to determine if the pro-
posed features are promising at all. We did not use
any classifier, we used the obtained scores to rank
the sentences of a given translation output from the
best to the worst. The Spearman?s rank correlation
coefficients between our ranking and the ranking ob-
tained using human scores are then computed on the
provided manually annotated data sets.
2 Morpheme- and POS-based features
A number of features for quality estimation have
been already investigated in previous work (Specia
et al., 2009). In this paper, we investigate two sets of
133
features which do not depend on any aspect of trans-
lation process but only on the morphological and
syntactic structures of the involved languages: the
IBM1 scores and the LM scores calculated on mor-
phemes and POS tags. The IBM1 scores describe
the correspondences between the structures of the
source and the target language, and the LM scores
describe the structure of the target language. In ad-
dition to the input source text and translated target
language hypothesis, a parallel bilingual corpus for
the desired language pair and a monolingual corpus
for the desired target language are required in or-
der to learn IBM1 and LM probabilities. Appropriate
POS taggers and tools for splitting words into mor-
phemes are necessary for each of the languages. The
POS tags cannot be only basic but must have all de-
tails (e.g. verb tenses, cases, number, gender, etc.).
2.1 IBM1 scores
The IBM1 model is a bag-of-word translation model
which gives the sum of all possible alignment proba-
bilities between the words in the source sentence and
the words in the target sentence. Brown et al. (1993)
defined the IBM1 probability score for a translation
pair fJ1 and e
I
1 in the following way:
P (fJ1 |e
I
1) =
1
(I + 1)J
J?
j=1
I?
i=0
p(fj |ei) (1)
where fJ1 is the source language sentence of length
J and eI1 is the target language sentence of length I .
As it is a conditional probability distribution, we
investigated both directions as quality scores. In or-
der to avoid frequent confusions about what is the
source and what the target language, we defined our
scores in the following way:
? source-to-hypothesis (sh) IBM1 score:
IBM1sh =
1
(H + 1)S
S?
j=1
H?
i=0
p(sj |hi) (2)
? hypothesis-to-source (hs) IBM1 score:
IBM1hs =
1
(S + 1)H
H?
i=1
S?
j=0
p(hi|sj) (3)
where sj are the units of the original source lan-
guage sentence, S is the length of this sentence, hi
are the units of the target language hypothesis, and
H is the length of this hypothesis.
The units investigated in this work are morphemes
and POS-4grams, thus we have the following four
IBM1 scores:
? MIBM1sh and MIBM1hs:
IBM1 scores of word morphemes in each direc-
tion;
? P4IBM1sh and P4IBM1hs:
IBM1 scores of POS 4grams in each direction.
2.2 Language model scores
The n-gram language model score is defined as:
P (eI1) =
I?
i=1
p(ei|ei...ei?n) (4)
where ei is the current target language word and
ei...ei?n is the history, i.e. the preceeding n words.
In this paper, the two following language model
scores are explored:
? MLM6:
morpheme-6gram language model score;
? PLM6:
POS-6gram language model score.
3 Experimental set-up
The IBM1 probabilities necessary for the IBM1
scores are learnt using the WMT 2010 News
Commentary Spanish-English, French-English and
German-English parallel texts. The language mod-
els are trained on the corresponding target parts of
this corpus using the SRI language model tool (Stol-
cke, 2002). The POS tags for all languages were pro-
duced using the TreeTagger1, and the morphemes
are obtained using the Morfessor tool (Creutz and
Lagus, 2005). The tool is corpus-based and
language-independent: it takes a text as input and
produces a segmentation of the word forms observed
in the text. The obtained results are not strictly

134
linguistic, however they often resemble a linguistic
morpheme segmentation. Once a morpheme seg-
mentation has been learnt from some text, it can
be used for segmenting new texts. In our experi-
ments, the splitting are learnt from the training cor-
pus used for the IBM1 lexicon probabilities. The
obtained segmentation is then used for splitting the
corresponding source texts and hypotheses. Detailed
corpus statistics are shown in Table 1.
Using the obtained probabilities, the scores de-
scribed in Section 2 are calculated for the pro-
vided annotated data: the English-Spanish data from
WMT 2008 consisting of four translation outputs
produced by four different systems (Specia et al.,
2010), the French-English and English-Spanish data
from WMT 2010 (Specia, 2011), as well as for an
additional WMT 2011 German-English and English-
German annotated data. The human quality scores
for the first two data sets range from 1 to 4, and for
the third data set from 1 to 3. The interpretation of
human scores is:
1. requires complete retranslation (bad)
2. post-editing quicker than retranslation (edit?);
this class was omitted for the third data set
3. little post-editing needed (edit+)
4. fit for purpose (good)
As a first step, the arithmetic means and standard
deviations are calculated for each feature and each
class in order to see if the features are at all possible
candidates for quality estimation, i.e. if the values
for different classes are distinct.
After that, the main test is carried out: for each
of the features, the Spearman correlation coefficient
? with the human ranking are calculated for each
document. In total, 9 correlation coefficients are ob-
tained for each score ? four Spanish outputs from the
WMT 2008 task, one Spanish and one English output
from the WMT 2010 as well as one English and two
German outputs from the WMT 2011 task.
The obtained correlation results were then sum-
marised into the following two values:
? mean
a correlation coefficient averaged over all trans-
lation outputs;
? rank>
percentage of translation outputs where the par-
ticular feature has better correlation than the
other investigated features.
4 Results
4.1 Arithmetic means
The preliminary experiments consisted of compar-
ing arithmetic means of scores for each feature and
each class. The idea is: if the values are distinct
enough, the feature is a potential candidate for qual-
ity estimation. In addition, standard deviations were
calculated in order to estimate the overlapping.
For most translation outputs, all of our features
have distinct arithmetic means for different classes
and decent standard deviations, indicating that they
are promising for further investigation. On all WMT
2011 outputs annotated with three classes, the dis-
tinction is rather clear, as well as for the majority of
the four class outputs.
However, on some of the four class translation
outputs, the values of the bad translation class were
unexpected in the following two ways:
? the bad class overlaps with the edit? class;
? the bad class overlaps with the edit+ class.
The first overlapping problem occured on two trans-
lation outputs of the 2011 set, and the second one on
the both outputs of the 2010 set.
Examples for the PLM6 and P4IBM1sh features
are shown in Table 2. First two rows present three
class and four class outputs with separated arith-
metic means, the first problem is shown in the third
row, and the second (and more serious) problem is
presented in the last row.
These overlaps have not been investigated further
in the framework of this work, however this should
be studied deeply (especially the second problem) in
order to better understand the underlying phenom-
ena and improve the features.
4.2 Spearman correlation coefficients
As mentioned in the previous section, Spearman
rank correlation coefficients are calculated for each
translation output and for each feature, and sum-
marised into two values described in Section 3, i.e.

mean and rank>. The results are shown in Table 3.
In can be seen that the best individual features are
POS IBM1 scores followed by POS LM score.
The next step was to investigate combinations of
the individual features. First, we calculated arith-
metic mean of POS based features only, since they
are more promising than the morpheme based ones,
however we did not yield any improvements over
the individual mean values. As a next step, we in-
troduced weights to the features according to their
mean correlations, i.e. we did not omit the mor-
pheme features but put more weight on the POS
based ones. Nevertheless, this also did not result
in an improvement. Furthermore, we tried a sim-
ple arithmetic mean of all features, and this resulted
in a better Spearman correlation coefficients.
Following all these observations, we decided to
submit the arithmetic mean of all features to the
WMT 2012 quality estimation task. Our submission
consisted only of sentence ranking without scores,
since we did not convert our scores to the inter-
val [1,5]. Therefore we did not get any MAE or
RMSE results, only DeltaAvg and Spearman corre-
lation coefficients which were both 0.46. The high-
est scores in the shared task were 0.63, the lowest
about 0.15, and for the ?baseline? system which uses
a set of well established features with an SVM clas-
sifier about 0.55.
5 Conclusions and outlook
The results presented in this article show that the
IBM1 and the LM scores calculated on POS tags and
morphemes have the potential to be used for the
estimation of translation quality. These results are
very preliminary, offering many directions for future
work. The most important points are to use a classi-
fier, as well as to combine the proposed features with
already established features. Furthermore, the bad
class overlapping problem described in Section 4.1
should be further investigated and understood.
