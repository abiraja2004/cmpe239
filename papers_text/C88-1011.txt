ABSTRACT 
This paper deals with the training phase of a Markov-type 
linguistic model that is based on transition probabilities 
between pvirs and triplets of syntactic ategories. To deter- 
mine the o?timal evel of detail for a set of syntactic lasses 
we developed a systetn that uses a set-theoretical formalism 
to defiue such sets mid has some measm~s to comp~uce and 
c,ptimize them fildividually. 
In section two we describe the optimizafiou problem (hi 
terms of piediction, infoimation and economy requilements) 
and our approach to its solution. Section three introduces the 
system dlat will assist a lhlguist in h,'mdling the prediction 
and economy criteria and in the last section we plesent some 
slunple lemtlts that can be achieved with it. 
I. IN' fRODUCrlON 
The context in which we strutted evclopping the system 
described ia this paper is the I~NPRIT project #860, 'I.,inguis- 
tic Analysis of the European I.,anguages', which deals with 
seven European languages. 
The rnah~ objective of the project is to provide a language 
independe~t softw,'we enviromnent for dealing with the lin- 
guistic phase of a number of applications in the re'din of 
office a/ito:mation such as high quality, natural soundhlg text- 
to-speech ~:onversion for unlimited vocabularies, automatic 
speech recognition for large vocabularies, and omni-font 
optical character eading includhlg automatic reading of 
handwriting. 
The decision on what type of linguistic model to be used 
ill the project was made at an early stage. It was decided to 
aim at a probabilistic positional gramnrar (a Mmkov-type 
grammar) based on transition probabilities of pairs and tri- 
plets of syntactic ategories. Tile use of Matkov-type models 
immediately incurs the necessity of defilting training texts. 
We started out with trainhlg corpora of approximately 
100,000 words of official EEC publications, that were avail- 
able hi all languages of the community. The training consists 
of buildhlg a number of data structures. 'File first is a lexicon 
of ,'111 words that occur in the text, with their attendmlt prob- 
ability of occurl~uce and all possible wordclasses. The sec- 
ond structme is formed by two and three dimensional matri- 
ces describing the transition probabilities between pairs or 
triplets, respectively, of wordclasses. Clearly, the probabili- 
lies specified depend on the choice of syntactic categores 
along the dimensions. One of the major problems with a Mal- 
koviml approach is to determine the optimal evel of detail of 
the wordclasses for each dimension. In tiffs paper we will 
describe a softwale systetn that helps linguists ha carrying out 
experitnents aimed at finding an 'optitnal' system of word- 
classes. 
2. MARKOW ANALYSIS OF LARGE CORPORA 
AND WORDCLASS SYSTEMS 
The prOblem of finding a suitable wordclass et for statistical 
disambiguation of syntactic labelling may be fommlated 
more precisely and fomlally as follows: 
Find a set of wordelass labels (with gross wordclass and com- 
plex information) that can label each word of a language and 
1. is minimal in the number of labels (economy require- 
ment) 
2. provides high predictive power for adjacent word- 
classes in a chain. A formal way to do this is by mini- 
mizing tile average ntropy of N-dimensional transition 
probabilities for subsequent labels in sentences, e.g. 
reduced to the two-dimensional case, to minimize: 
E = - P(tjlt,)to (P(blZO)l,  
j i 
with: 
S 
n 
i j  
P(alb) 
summation symbol 
number of labels in the system 
indices running from 1 to n 
conditional probability of 'a' given 'b' 
(prediction requirement) 
3. is maximal in the amount of infomaation about each 
labelled word, e.g. for syntactic analysis or disambigu- 
ation of alternative graphemic hypotheses. (informa- 
tion requirement) 
To find an exact solution to this problem is difficult - if 
not impossible, because of 
the dimensionality of the optinfization problem (given the 
large number of wordclasses needed to obtain useful 
parsing results) 
- the difficulty to define a unique starting set of word- 
classes for an optimization 
the dependence of a possible finite solution on the anal- 
ysed corpus 
Our approach to this problem is to start from a very 
detailed hierarchical wordclass system including complex 
information. Tile degree of detail can be reduced by means of 
the notion of "cover symbols" that form partifioltings of the 
original system. Cover symbols and w0rdclasses not 
accounted for by cover symbols are called 'labels'. Initially, 
cover symbols will be created by combining wordclass 
symbols for related classes - e.g. the classes "verb, 1. person 
singtdar indicative present active" and "verb, 1. per:;on singu- 
lar conjunctive present active" giving a cover symbol "verb, 
1. person singular present active". At a later stage other 
cover symbols can be created by combining and excluding 
wordclass symbols and already existing cover symbols. \]\[~a 
the optimization process different sets of." labels are created 
subsequently mad compared by measmes ~elated to either of 
the criteria mentioned. 
A user working in the optimization process ~eeds meas~ 
ures to compare the significance of individual labels within a 
given set and to estimate the usefulness of joining labels i~,~to 
new, more comprehensive cover symbols'. Az one measur~ 
for criterium two we use the entropy directly in a global ~nd 
diagnostic way. Additionally a number of measures have 
been defined that are related to entropy and give more spe- 
cific information on the performance of individual labels. 
Given a text in which to each word a label has beetg 
assigned that is: 
1. the basic wordclass, if this has not been defined as 
belonging to a cover symbol 
2. file applicable covet" symbol otherwise 
and given a 2D-matrix that contains relative frequencies 
of transitions from any label (wordclass or cover symbol) to 
any other label in the text, then some useful rueastn'es are 
the branclfing factor for a given label, that tells how many 
different labels actually followed/preceeded it in an anal- 
ysed text. 
file variance of the transition probabilities in a row/cob 
umn of the matrix, that indicates how much the strength 
of connections from the label to sttrrotmding labels varies 
as ,analysed fi~om a text. 
tile correlation between different rows/columns of the 
matrix, that gives information about how similarly the 
labels behave in a general right/left context, i.e. how 
much itffomtation will be lost by combining two labels 
into a new cover symbol. 
file relative frequency of a given label, that indicates tile 
relative labelling relevance wiflfin a given system. 
The measures defined here for a 2D-matrix, can be 
applied to a 3D-matrix in a similar way, e.g. the colxelafion 
between two labels in the same matrix dimellsion then means 
cox~relating the numbers of two planes.

Example 1: 
If a user works on a 3D-matrix with the matl/x editor aid 
considers inclusion of all conjunctions into one cover symbol 
in the first scope, but wants to leave the most frequent labels 
out, he/she will look e.g. at a part of the matrix by a com- 
m,'u~d 
DISPLAY C .. . . . . . . .  ;; 
which will give a display of only those parts of the matlix 
where a conjtmction stands in the first position of the Markov 
chain. 
Let us assume that the ,nest frequent labels ,-u'e 
C(K)#######, C02..##### and 'all labels C01 but without 
C01..#####, the,l he/she could define the cover symbol 
'ZCON'  for scope I in the following way: 
ZCON =

( COO#######, C02#######, 
C01 ... . . . .  ! C01#####); 
with: '0' the list operator 
'!' the exception operator 
'_ZCEX' a local nanre 
With the help of tiffs new cover symbol we cru~ transform 
the matrix accordiugly.

The very low standard eviation of the label A17.....## casts 
considerable doubt upou its significance; it will probably be 
included into a cover symbol. The label COO#######, on the

The labels M02####### and B02####### have a high

mine the significance of such an operation by checking the 
standard deviation, branchhlg factor and the relative freu 
quency. Also the third criterium as defined in section two has 
to be taken into account.

definition of cover symbols for the main word classes. '171e

DEFINITIONS 
The grammar is in BN-fonn, where: 
'1' mevas optionality, 
'1' alternative, 
'<' and '>' nontemainal, 
informal desclhptions are between double quotes. 
SET 
cover symbols used ill the map can only be excluded 
from other cover symbols (not included, otherwise the 
mapping would be inconsistent). This gives the con- 
sttaint use of cover symbol notations within a cover sym- 
bol definition, E.g. in an expression Z1 = 
<expl>!(<exp2>!<exp3>), the cover symbol set becomes 
inconsiste.t, if another cover symbol Z2 occurs included 
in <expl> or <exp3>, 
cover symbols occuning on the right side of a definition 
must be defined in the same file.
