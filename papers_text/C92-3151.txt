A SE I ' -~C APPROACTq TO I.EXICAL SEMANTICS 
D.DU101T, MEMODATA. 
~stlRclagrilt~ 
We present the results of the work carried out over 
several years by the Memodata Company on the 
slructure of the French lexicon. This work has been 
accomplished thanks to a first research contract 
with the Ministry of Research and Technology and 
today has lead to a dictionary of more than 100 000 
words and phrases grouped analogically and 
syr~ymo~y. 
If we understand quite well how a dictiolmry like 
this can be used with ease by humans, we set the 
problem of the identification of meaning by a 
computer. We will evaluate how Dicologique adds 
information eomplentaty to the information 
contained in semantic nets. Thanks to a somewhat 
unusual cons~on method and the systematic 
classification of words according to their meaning, 
we are progressing to a continuous ystem of 
localisalion of the meaning itself. On the map we 
created, it is possible to compute the meaning due 
to lexical semantics for any sentence written in 
natural language... 
1) ~ rt~,,om or  ~xXaC_AL 
IRCTIONARH~ 
The purpose of dictionaries grouped under the 
name "analogical" isalways the ease of the passage 
from a word to an idea and the inverse passage 
from an idea to a word. This aim is reached by the 
make up of lists of stereotyped associations and of 
semantic fidds. The first aRnoach does not have 
the same likelihood of ending with a satisfactory 
result as the second. 
The stereotyped associations depend on the idea of 
time, the background and the experience of each 
individual. Their record can only be a track of the 
~ v e  memory from the individual. 
On the other hand, the dictionary of semantic fields 
is perfectly workable at any time ; it is based on the 
linguistic ~x~aventicqrs that the language dictionaries 
have tried for ~nturies to record and to normalize. 
It is not possible, by definition, to consmact a 
dictionary made up of stereotyped ass~ations, 
whereas it is possible to work on the complexity of 
hundreds and t.housar~ of linguistic facts which 
we have classified. 
We will give a mathematical description of the 
dictionary of the semantic fields. This approach is 
in parallel with concrete xamples derived from the 
database. 
2) ~ Area ~Tm~ or  Tr~ 
"lhe dictionary of analogies and synonyms that has 
been set up is a structure of sets and words which 
the conceptual figure (1) shows. The objects 
"words" (shown by W,,) are represented in the 
reclhngles and the objects "sets" (shown by Ci) in 
the parallelograms.

In ~ t h e ~  me 9 types of sets : 
- fot~ types of sets mrmd "lists". 
They give the quasi synonyms, i.e. lists 
of words which are equivalent in ~ and 
identical in grammar. We have the following types 
of grammatical sets : noun, verb, adjective, 
adverb. 
- the set mn-~ "dass" 
A set of this type ?xmtains nouns which can be 
subsumed under the same concept. 
In our example in figure (2), "bateau" is a set 
containing on the one hand words which represent 
its ~ vahe.s ("bateau', "navire", 
"embarcalion") and ca the ocher "~"  of 
specific boats~ 
- the set mn~ "mlazd ~xts" 
~ y ,  the contents and utilizations of this type 
of set are rather various. We need it, for example, 
to ~ t  the link between "baleinier" and 
"baleine "13, which is not shown in figure 2 so as 
not to weigh down the graph. 
-tbe set mrmd "tlxrne" 
This set contains all the concepts and words 
associated ina particular semantic field. It may also 
contain ~ sets such as "related words" or 
smaller "thetis". 
- the set mmed "des:ripfm" 
It contains the constituents organically ~ to 
a ~ It is only used when absolutely 
necessary for a definition. 
- the set nmmd"~"  
It mabsumes words having the same outstanding 
feature. For example, our set of class "bateau 16ger 
de #che" could be found under a set characterized 
by the feature "small" which differenciates this 
class from other classes of boats. 
As for the words, we have provided them with the 
usual characteristics, i.e. their morphological 
classes (grammar) and their usage labels 
(colloquial, archaic, literary ...) which contain the 
labekine: ~ le

~ficfionary. 
~ Use ~e p~m d~ia~s  ~ t~o~k~e 
Moving through the dictionary from the general to 
the particular is a process widely put into practice 
by users who may either search a precise term to 
be discovered by intersection ofassociated concepts 
or intend to edit a lexical field or a classified list. 
~ ofana~_ 
The logic of the sets takes into account he logical 
"and", "or" and negation. Here are some examples 
of ~arches which are always based on the 
intersection fsets edited by the function U(Cj) : 
- Search ofapnxfise mm 
Search of the name of the "coiffure du Pape t4''. 
The intersection of "Pape l-s" (theme of 162 words) 
and "chapeau ~6" (list of 180 words) or 
"couronne m (theme of 33 words) produces the 
Wol~ds "\[Jal~ 18", "calott~ 19" et~. in 10 seconds on 
the micro eompuler. 
- Search of v~ds *o extmms aa klea 
Search of the verb to express the idea of "faire 
to~0.  and "couper 21". T~ intersection of the 
two lists of corresponding verbs converges on 
alxx~ 20 words (abattre, d6~apiter, ~ter, 
~brancher .. 3. 
- Sea~ of syrmyrm acemting ta a ctm~xt 
The synonym of "voler 2v' such that the meaning is 
more suitable for a bee. The words "bufil'ler 23" and 
"voltige~ '24" ale immediately produced.

confinously through the whole field concerned.

This is especially interesting for the sets containing

the scientific taxonomy of the animal world. Atxmt

~ucture of 500 classes.

A set named Cj may beincluded in 1 to f~ sets C~ (i 
going from 1 to ~, f~ being the number of 
"parents" (main sets) of Cj). 
This function permits, therefore, to move upward 
(towards the root node) in the structure of the sets. 
In figure (2), the set "bateau de l~he de plaisance" 
is defined by the set of sets h = {{bateau de 
p~zhe}, {bateau de phisan~}}. 
A terminal word W. can belong to 1 to I sets Ci (i 
going from 1 to I, I being the number of "parents" 
(main sets) of W,). 
In Dicologique the direct questioning of a word

But the position of the computer is very different :
if humans possess the structures necessary for 
interpreting the terms, i. e. the linguistic heritage 
and the knowledge of the world, the computer for 
its part possesses neither of them. This is why we 
try to supply it with the lexical knowledge 
absolutely necessary ina coherent system. 
Obviously this knowledge is situated in the 
inheritance from the "primitives" to the words. 
Let's see an example in which the motion from the 
right to the left is applied to a problem of automatic 
indexing in information retrieval. 
2.3 An an~a6m to ~Jt~m~i~ rnrlt'val 
We want the system to retrieve the lexieal key 
elements of the following small piece of text : 
"The accident, on Friday, took place in foggy 
weather. The two ears that cmsbed into each other 
caused a pile up of about 50 vehicles on the 
congested national dual carriageway." 
Strategy for resolution : 
The strictly lexical analysis of this short passage 
win be based on the calculation of the surface 
cormslxmding toeach cxmeept (set) covering one or 
more words of this document : the more abstract a
concept, he bigger its an'face. 
For e~ setq we ~ aerrea ~ earar'~ M(Q) 
and i~ a~ in com0adsm wi~ ~ ~fimia've r~ci, q3,

We define the ftmaim (Cj) to nxasme the dimme 
Izt~ma the om0~ Q and the ~ tl~ ~

Tre anface of a omcept is given by the fmnuh as

cahllat~ o f~ mrf~e of C~ 
Nqes: 
1) Each ~amCel~ possesses h evaluations of its 
surface accounting for its h series of connections. 
2) In reality A(Cj) takes into account a 
complementary pieoe of information : the semantic 
characteristics of sets. A set of the type "list" 
introduces a more stretched arc than a set of the 
types "theme" or "related words". 
3) If Dioologique is a general dictionary capable of 
resolving problems of information retrieval 
referring to general anguage, it is very easy to 
adjust it to a precise problem (for example, the 
thesaurus of a Slxcific undertaking). One only has 
to stretch t~da arc situated on the passage of the 
series of conneclions of each term of the thesaurus. 
The surfaces S, which are situated in a norm 
mferenee, describe a map of meaning on which all 
the continuous calculations of Euclidian geon~try 
are made possible. 
To resolve our problem, it is possible to keep the 
mathematical expressions very simple : a simple 
Each word of the document is recognized in the 
dictionary as it activates all the sects containing it 
according to their specific weights S(Q) which 
depend on their series of ?x~r~xfions.

It is difficult to present completely the method of 
we use as we lack of the supplementary 
page this would involve. To put it simply, all of the 
100000 words and ctaxent phrases, the 15000 
typified sets have been created manually and are 
continually worked over again, thanks to a 
structuring tool specially developed for this 
purpose. 
The 350 000 ob~,waliom of direct connections of 
words, the 4 000 000 series of inh~tanee which 
we run currently are, proportional to our efforts, 
daily and of better quality. 
The point at issue in this iterative procedure is, of 
course, to ~ appear in Dicologique tendencies 
towards ets of "primitives" in the linguistic sense. 
The number and articulation of these primitives 
should be both sufficient and necessary to define 
the objects depending on them. 
Our will is to continue working on the ~ of 
the lexicon, as to the quantity of vocabulary 
represented of course, but principally with 
to the quality of the ~ of the lexicon. 
Moreover, we have been developing basic 
such as the Semiographe for information retrieval 
which allow us to evaluate the progression of the 
quality of interpretations we olXain. If we hope to
