Abstract
We address the problem of training the free
parameters of a statistical machine transla-
tion system. We show significant improve-
ments over a state-of-the-art minimum er-
ror rate training baseline on a large Chinese-
English translation task. We present novel
training criteria based on maximum likeli-
hood estimation and expected loss compu-
tation. Additionally, we compare the maxi-
mum a-posteriori decision rule and the min-
imum Bayes risk decision rule. We show
that, not only from a theoretical point of
view but also in terms of translation qual-
ity, the minimum Bayes risk decision rule is
preferable.
1 Introduction
Once we specified the Bayes decision rule for statis-
tical machine translation, we have to address three
problems (Ney, 2001):
? the search problem, i.e. how to find the best
translation candidate among all possible target
language sentences;
? the modeling problem, i.e. how to structure
the dependencies of source and target language
sentences;
? the training problem, i.e. how to estimate the
free parameters of the models from the training
data.
Here, the main focus is on the training problem. We
will compare a variety of training criteria for statisti-
cal machine translation. In particular, we are consid-
ering criteria for the log-linear parameters or model
scaling factors. We will introduce new training cri-
teria based on maximum likelihood estimation and
expected loss computation. We will show that some
achieve significantly better results than the standard
minimum error rate training of (Och, 2003).
Additionally, we will compare two decision rules,
the common maximum a-posteriori (MAP) deci-
sion rule and the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) de-
cision rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). We will show
that the minimum Bayes risk decision rule results
in better translation quality than the maximum a-
posteriori decision rule for several training criteria.
The remaining part of this paper is structured
as follows: first, we will describe related work in
Sec. 2. Then, we will briefly review the baseline
system, Bayes decision rule for statistical machine
translation and automatic evaluation metrics for ma-
chine translation in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, respectively.
The novel training criteria are described in Sec. 5
and Sec. 6. Experimental results are reported in
Sec. 7 and conclusions are given in Sec. 8.
2 Related Work
The most common modeling approach in statistical
machine translation is to use a log-linear combina-
tion of several sub-models (Och and Ney, 2002). In
(Och and Ney, 2002), the log-linear weights were
tuned to maximize the mutual information criterion
(MMI). The current state-of-the-art is to optimize
these parameters with respect to the final evaluation
criterion; this is the so-called minimum error rate
training (Och, 2003).
Minimum Bayes risk decoding for machine trans-
524
lation was introduced in (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
It was shown that MBR outperforms MAP decoding
for different evaluation criteria. Further experiments
using MBR for Bleu were performed in (Venugopal
et al, 2005; Ehling et al, 2007). Here, we will
present additional evidence that MBR decoding is
preferable over MAP decoding.
Tillmann and Zhang (2006) describe a percep-
tron style algorithm for training millions of features.
Here, we focus on the comparison of different train-
ing criteria.
Shen et al (2004) compared different algorithms
for tuning the log-linear weights in a reranking
framework and achieved results comparable to the
standard minimum error rate training.
An annealed minimum risk approach is presented
in (Smith and Eisner, 2006) which outperforms both
maximum likelihood and minimum error rate train-
ing. The parameters are estimated iteratively using
an annealing technique that minimizes the risk of an
expected-BLEU approximation, which is similar to
the one presented in this paper.
3 Baseline System
In statistical machine translation, we are given a
source language sentence fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ ,
which is to be translated into a target language sen-
tence eI1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Statistical decision the-
ory tells us that among all possible target language
sentences, we should choose the sentence which
minimizes the expected loss, also called Bayes risk:
e?I?1 = argmin
I,eI1
{
?
I?,e?I
?
1
Pr(e?I
?
1 |f
J
1 ) ? L(e
I
1, e
?I?
1 )
}
Here, L(eI1, e
?I?
1 ) denotes the loss function under
consideration. It measures the loss (or errors) of a
candidate translation eI1 assuming the correct trans-
lation is e?I
?
1 . In the following, we will call this de-
cision rule the MBR rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
This decision rule is optimal in the sense that any
other decision rule will result (on average) in at least
as many errors as the MBR rule. Despite this, most
SMT systems do not use theMBR decision rule. The
most common approach is to use the maximum a-
posteriori (MAP) decision rule. Thus, we select the
hypothesis which maximizes the posterior probabil-
ity Pr(eI1|f
J
1 ):
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1|f
J
1 )
}
This is equivalent to the MBR decision rule under
a 0-1 loss function:
L0?1(e
I
1, e
?I?
1 ) =
{
0 if eI1 = e
?I?
1
1 else
Hence, the MAP decision rule is optimal for the
sentence or string error rate. It is not necessarily
optimal for other evaluation metrics such as the Bleu
score. One reason for the popularity of the MAP
decision rule might be that, compared to the MBR
rule, its computation is simpler.
The posterior probability Pr(eI1|f
J
1 ) is modeled
directly using a log-linear combination of several
models (Och and Ney, 2002):
p?M1 (e
I
1|f
J
1 ) =
exp
(?M
m=1 ?mhm(e
I
1, f
J
1 )
)
?
I?,e?I
?
1
exp
(?M
m=1 ?mhm(e
?I?
1 , f
J
1 )
)
(1)
This approach is a generalization of the source-
channel approach (Brown et al, 1990). It has the
advantage that additional models h(?) can be easily
integrated into the overall system.
The denominator represents a normalization fac-
tor that depends only on the source sentence fJ1 .
Therefore, we can omit it in case of the MAP de-
cision rule during the search process and obtain:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
M?
m=1
?mhm(e
I
1, f
J
1 )
}
Note that the denominator affects the results of the
MBR decision rule and, thus, cannot be omitted in
that case.
We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation
system similar to (Koehn, 2004; Mauser et al, 2006)
including the following models: an n-gram lan-
guage model, a phrase translation model and a word-
based lexicon model. The latter two models are used
for both directions: p(f |e) and p(e|f). Additionally,
we use a word penalty, phrase penalty and a distor-
tion penalty.
525
In the following, we will discuss the so-called
training problem (Ney, 2001): how do we train the
free parameters ?M1 of the model? The current
state-of-the-art is to use minimum error rate train-
ing (MERT) as described in (Och, 2003). The free
parameters are tuned to directly optimize the evalu-
ation criterion.
Except for the MERT, the training criteria that
we will consider are additive at the sentence-level.
Thus, the training problem for a development set
with S sentences can be formalized as:
??M1 = argmax
?M1
S?
s=1
F (?M1 , (e
I
1, f
J
1 )s) (2)
Here, F (?, ?) denotes the training criterion that we
would like to maximize and (eI1, f
J
1 )s denotes a sen-
tence pair in the development set. The optimization
is done using the Downhill Simplex algorithm from
the Numerical Recipes book (Press et al, 2002).
This is a general purpose optimization procedure
with the advantage that it does not require the deriva-
tive information. Before we will describe the details
of the different training criteria in Sec. 5 and 6, we
will discuss evaluation metrics in the following sec-
tion.
4 Evaluation Metrics
The automatic evaluation of machine translation is
currently an active research area. There exists a
variety of different metrics, e.g., word error rate,
position-independent word error rate, BLEU score
(Papineni et al, 2002), NIST score (Doddington,
2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), GTM
(Turian et al, 2003). Each of them has advantages
and shortcomings.
A popular metric for evaluating machine trans-
lation quality is the Bleu score (Papineni et al,
2002). It has certain shortcomings for compar-
ing different machine translation systems, especially
if comparing conceptually different systems, e.g.
phrase-based versus rule-based systems, as shown
in (Callison-Burch et al, 2006). On the other hand,
Callison-Burch concluded that the Bleu score is re-
liable for comparing variants of the same machine
translation system. As this is exactly what we will
need in our experiments and as Bleu is currently the
most popular metric, we have chosen it as our pri-
mary evaluation metric. Nevertheless, most of the
methods we will present can be easily adapted to
other automatic evaluation metrics.
In the following, we will briefly review the com-
putation of the Bleu score as some of the training
criteria are motivated by this. The Bleu score is a
combination of the geometric mean of n-gram pre-
cisions and a brevity penalty for too short translation
hypotheses. The Bleu score for a translation hypoth-
esis eI1 and a reference translation e?
I?
1 is computed as:
Bleu(eI1, e?
I?
1) = BP(I, I?) ?
4?
n=1
Precn(e
I
1, e?
I?
1)
1/4
with
BP(I, I?) =
{
1 if I ? I?
exp (1 ? I/I?) if I < I?
Precn(e
I
1, e?
I?
1) =
?
wn1
min{C(wn1 |e
I
1), C(w
n
1 |e?
I?
1)}
?
wn1
C(wn1 |e
I
1)
(3)
Here, C(wn1 |e
I
1) denotes the number of occur-
rences of an n-gram wn1 in a sentence e
I
1. The de-
nominators of the n-gram precisions evaluate to the
number of n-grams in the hypothesis, i.e. I ?n+1.
The n-gram counts for the Bleu score computa-
tion are usually collected over a whole document.
For our purposes, a sentence-level computation is
preferable. A problem with the sentence-level Bleu
score is that the score is zero if not at least one four-
gram matches. As we would like to avoid this prob-
lem, we use the smoothed sentence-level Bleu score
as suggested in (Lin and Och, 2004). Thus, we in-
crease the nominator and denominator of Precn(?, ?)
by one for n > 1. Note that we will use the
sentence-level Bleu score only during training. The
evaluation on the development and test sets will be
carried out using the standard Bleu score, i.e. at the
corpus level. As the MERT baseline does not require
the use of the sentence-level Bleu score, we use the
standard Bleu score for training the baseline system.
In the following, we will describe several crite-
ria for training the log-linear parameters ?M1 of our
model. For notational convenience, we assume that
there is just one reference translation. Nevertheless,
the methods can be easily adapted to the case of mul-
tiple references.
526
5 Maximum Likelihood
5.1 Sentence-Level Computation
A popular approach for training parameters is max-
imum likelihood estimation (MLE). Here, the goal
is to maximize the joint likelihood of the parameters
and the training data. For log-linear models, this re-
sults in a nice optimization criterion which is con-
vex and has a single optimum. It is equivalent to the
maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. We
obtain the following training criterion:
FML?S(?
M
1 , (e
I
1, f
J
1 )) = log p?M1 (e
I
1|f
J
1 )
A problem that we often face in practice is that
the correct translation might not be among the can-
didates that our MT system produces. Therefore,
(Och and Ney, 2002; Och, 2003) defined the trans-
lation candidate with the minimum word-error rate
as pseudo reference translation. This has some bias
towards minimizing the word-error rate. Here, we
will use the translation candidate with the maximum
Bleu score as pseudo reference to bias the system
towards the Bleu score. However, as pointed out in
(Och, 2003), there is no reason to believe that the re-
sulting parameters are optimal with respect to trans-
lation quality measured with the Bleu score.
The goal of this sentence-level criterion is to dis-
criminate the single correct translation against all the
other ?incorrect? translations. This is problematic
as, even for human experts, it is very hard to define
a single best translation of a sentence. Furthermore,
the alternative target language sentences are not all
equally bad translations. Some of them might be
very close to the correct translation or even equiva-
lent whereas other sentences may have a completely
different meaning. The sentence-level MLE crite-
rion does not distinguish these cases and is therefore
a rather harsh training criterion.
5.2 N -gram Level Computation
As an alternative to the sentence-level MLE, we
performed experiments with an n-gram level MLE.
Here, we limit the order of the n-grams and assume
conditional independence among the n-gram prob-
abilities. We define the log-likelihood (LLH) of a
target language sentence eI1 given a source language
sentence fJ1 as:
FML?N (?
M
1 , (e
I
1, f
J
1 )) =
N?
n=1
?
wn1?e
I
1
log p?M1 (w
n
1 |f
J
1 )
Here, we use the n-gram posterior probability
p?M1 (w
n
1 |f
J
1 ) as defined in (Zens and Ney, 2006).
The n-gram posterior distribution is smoothed using
a uniform distribution over all possible n-grams.
p?M1 (w
n
1 |f
J
1 ) = ? ?
N?M1 (w
n
1 , f
J
1 )
?
w?n1
N?M1 (w
?n
1 , f
J
1 )
+ (1 ? ?) ?
1
V n
Here, V denotes the vocabulary size of the tar-
get language; thus, V n is the number of possi-
ble n-grams in the target language. We define
N?M1 (w
n
1 , f
J
1 ) as in (Zens and Ney, 2006):
N?M1 (w
n
1 , f
J
1 ) =

I?n+1?
i=1
p?M1 (e
I
1|f
J
1 )??(e
i+n?1
i , w
n
1 )
(4)
The sum over the target language sentences is lim-
ited to an N -best list, i.e. the N best translation
candidates according to the baseline model. In this
equation, we use the Kronecker function ?(?, ?), i.e.
the term ?(ei+n?1i , w
n
1 ) evaluates to one if and only
if the n-gram wn1 occurs in the target sentence e
I
1
starting at position i.
An advantage of the n-gram level computation
of the likelihood is that we do not have to define
pseudo-references as for the sentence-level MLE.
We can easily compute the likelihood for the human
reference translation. Furthermore, this criterion has
the desirable property that it takes partial correctness
into account, i.e. it is not as harsh as the sentence-
level criterion.
6 Expected Bleu Score
According to statistical decision theory, one should
maximize the expected gain (or equivalently mini-
mize the expected loss). For machine translation,
this means that we should optimize the expected
Bleu score, or any other preferred evaluation metric.
527
6.1 Sentence-Level Computation
The expected Bleu score for a given source sentence
fJ1 and a reference translation e?
I?
1 is defined as:
E[Bleu|e?I?1, f
J
1 ] =
?
eI1
Pr(eI1|f
J
1 ) ? Bleu(e
I
1, e?
I?
1)
Here, Pr(eI1|f
J
1 ) denotes the true probability dis-
tribution over the possible translations eI1 of the
given source sentence fJ1 . As this probability dis-
tribution is unknown, we approximate it using the
log-linear translation model p?M1 (e
I
1|f
J
1 ) from Eq. 1.
Furthermore, the computation of the expected Bleu
score involves a sum over all possible translations
eI1. This sum is approximated using an N -best list,
i.e. the N best translation hypotheses of the MT sys-
tem. Thus, the training criterion for the sentence-
level expected Bleu computation is:
FEB?S(?
M
1 , (e?
I?
1, f
J
1 )) =
?
eI1
p?M1 (e
I
1|f
J
1 )?Bleu(e
I
1, e?
I?
1)
An advantage of the sentence-level computation is
that it is straightforward to plug in alternative eval-
uation metrics instead of the Bleu score. Note that
the minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) uses
only the target sentence with the maximum posterior
probability whereas, here, the whole probability dis-
tribution is taken into account.
6.2 N -gram Level Computation
In this section, we describe a more fine grained com-
putation of the expected Bleu score by exploiting its
particular structure. Hence, this derivation is spe-
cific for the Bleu score but should be easily adapt-
able to other n-gram based metrics. We can rewrite
the expected Bleu score as:
E[Bleu|e?I?1, f
J
1 ] = E[BP|I? , f
J
1 ]
?
4?
n=1
E[Precn|e?I?1, f
J
1 ]
1/4
We assumed conditional independence between
the brevity penalty BP and the n-gram precisions
Precn. Note that although these independence as-
sumptions do not hold, the resulting parameters
might work well for translation. In fact, we will
show that this criterion is among the best perform-
ing ones in Sec. 7. This type of independence as-
sumption is typical within the naive Bayes classifier
framework. The resulting training criterion that we
will use in Eq. 2 is then:
FEB?N (?
M
1 , (e?
I?
1, f
J
1 )) = E?M1 [BP|I? , f
J
1 ]
?
4?
n=1
E?M1 [Precn|e?

We still have to define the estimators for the ex-
pected brevity penalty as well as the expected n-
gram precision:
E?M1 [BP|I? , f
J
1 ] =
?
I
BP(I, I?) ? p?M1 (I|f
J
1 )
E?M1 [Precn|e?

c ? p?M1 (c|w

Here, we use the sentence length posterior proba-
bility p?M1 (I|f
J
1 ) as defined in (Zens and Ney, 2006)
and the n-gram posterior probability p?M1 (w
n
1 |f
J
1 ) as
described in Sec. 5.2. Additionally, we predict the
number of occurrences c of an n-gram. This infor-
mation is necessary for the so-called clipping in the
Bleu score computation, i.e. the min operator in the
nominator of formulae Eq. 3 and Eq. 5. The denom-
inator of Eq. 5 is the expected number of n-grams in
the target sentence, whereas the nominator denotes
the expected number of correct n-grams.
To predict the number of occurrences within a
translation hypothesis, we use relative frequencies
smoothed with a Poisson distribution. The mean of
the Poisson distribution ?(wn1 , f
J
1 , ?
M
1 ) is chosen to
be the mean of the unsmoothed distribution.

7 Experimental Results
7.1 Task Description
We perform translation experiments on the Chinese-
English TC-Star task. This is a broadcast news
speech translation task used within the European
Union project TC-Star1. The bilingual training
data consists of virtually all publicly available LDC
Chinese-English corpora. The 6-gram language
model was trained on the English part of the bilin-
gual training data and additional monolingual En-
glish parts from the GigaWord corpus. We use the
modified Kneser-Ney discounting as implemented
in the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
Annual public evaluations are carried out for this
task within the TC-Star project. We will report re-
sults on manual transcriptions, i.e. the so-called ver-
batim condition, of the official evaluation test sets of
the years 2006 and 2007. There are two reference
translations available for the development and test
sets. The corpus statistics are shown in Table 1.
7.2 Translation Results
In Table 2, we present the translation results
for different training criteria for the development
1http://www.tc-star.org
set and the two blind test sets. The reported
case-sensitive Bleu scores are computed using
the mteval-v11b.pl2 tool using two reference
translations, i.e. BLEUr2n4c. Note that already the
baseline system (MERT-Bleu) would have achieved
the first rank in the official TC-Star evaluation 2006;
the best Bleu score in that evaluation was 16.1%.
The MBR hypotheses were generated using the
algorithm described in (Ehling et al, 2007) on a
10 000-best list.
On the development data, the MERT-Bleu
achieves the highest Bleu score. This seems reason-
able as it is the objective of this training criterion.
The maximum likelihood (MLE) criteria perform
somewhat worse under MAP decoding. Interest-
ingly, the MBR decoding can compensate this to
a large extent: all criteria achieve a Bleu score of
about 18.9% on the development set. The bene-
fits of MBR decoding become even more evident
on the two test sets. Here, the MAP results for the
sentence-level MLE criterion are rather poor com-
pared to the MERT-Bleu. Nevertheless, using MBR
decoding results in very similar Bleu scores for most
of the criteria on these two test sets. We can there-
fore support the claim of (Smith and Eisner, 2006)
that MBR tends to have better generalization capa-
bilities.
The n-gram level MLE criterion seems to perform
better than the sentence-level MLE criterion, espe-
cially on the test sets. The reasons might be that
there is no need for the use of pseudo references
as described in Sec. 5 and that partial correctness
is taken into account.
The best results are achieved using the expected
Bleu score criteria described in Sec. 6. Here, the sen-
tence level and n-gram level variants achieve more
or less the same results. The overall improvement
on the Eval?06 set is about 1.0% Bleu absolute for
MAP decoding and 0.9% for MBR decoding. On
the Eval?07 set, the improvements are even larger,
about 1.8% Bleu absolute for MAP and 1.1% Bleu
for MBR. All these improvements are statistically
significant at the 99% level using a pairwise signifi-
cance test3.
Given that currently the most popular approach is
to use MERT-Bleu MAP decoding, the overall im-

provement is about 1.4% absolute for the Eval?06
set and 1.9% absolute on the Eval?07 set.
Note that the MBR decision rule almost always
outperforms theMAP decision rule. In the rare cases
where the MAP decision rule yields better results,
the difference in terms of Bleu score are small and
not statistically significant.
We also investigated the effect of the maximum
n-gram order for the n-gram level maximum like-
lihood estimation (MLE). The results are shown in
Figure 1. We observe an increase of the Bleu score
with increasing maximum n-gram order for the de-
velopment corpus. On the evaluation sets, however,
the maximum is achieved if the maximum n-gram
order is limited to four. This seems intuitive as the
Bleu score uses n-grams up to length four. However,
one should be careful here: the differences are rather
small, so it might be just statistical noise.
Some translation examples from the Eval?07 test
set are shown in Table 3 for different training criteria
under the maximum a-posteriori decision rule.
8 Conclusions
We have presented a systematic comparison of sev-
eral criteria for training the log-linear parameters of
a statistical machine translation system. Addition-
ally, we have compared the maximum a-posteriori
with the minimum Bayes risk decision rule.
We can conclude that the expected Bleu score
is not only a theoretically sound training criterion,
but also achieves the best results in terms of Bleu
score. The improvement over a state-of-the-art
MERT baseline is 1.3% Bleu absolute for the MAP
decision rule and 1.1% Bleu absolute for the MBR
decision rule for the large Chinese-English TC-Star
speech translation task.

decision rule.
We presented two methods for computing the ex-
pected Bleu score: a sentence-level and an n-gram
level approach. Both yield similar results. We think
that the n-gram level computation has certain ad-
vantages: The n-gram posterior probabilities could
be computed from a word graph which would result
in more reliable estimates. Whether this pays off
in terms of translation quality is left open for future
work.
Another interesting result of our experiments is
that the MBR decision rule seems to be less affected
by sub-optimal parameter settings.
Although it is well-known that the MBR decision
rule is more appropriate than the MAP decision rule,
the latter is more popular in the SMT community
(and many other areas of natural language process-
ing). Our results show that it can be beneficial to

computation of the MBR hypotheses is more time
consuming. Therefore, it would be desirable to have
a more efficient algorithm for computing the MBR
hypotheses.
