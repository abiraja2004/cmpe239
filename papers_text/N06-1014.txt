Abstract
We present an unsupervised approach to
symmetric word alignment in which two
simple asymmetric models are trained
jointly to maximize a combination of
data likelihood and agreement between
the models. Compared to the stan-
dard practice of intersecting predictions of
independently-trained models, joint train-
ing provides a 32% reduction in AER.
Moreover, a simple and efficient pair of
HMM aligners provides a 29% reduction
in AER over symmetrized IBM model 4
predictions.
1 Introduction
Word alignment is an important component of a
complete statistical machine translation pipeline
(Koehn et al, 2003). The classic approaches to un-
supervised word alignment are based on IBM mod-
els 1?5 (Brown et al, 1994) and the HMM model
(Ney and Vogel, 1996) (see Och and Ney (2003) for
a systematic comparison). One can classify these
six models into two groups: sequence-based models
(models 1, 2, and HMM) and fertility-based models
(models 3, 4, and 5).1 Whereas the sequence-based
models are tractable and easily implemented, the
more accurate fertility-based models are intractable
and thus require approximation methods which are
1IBM models 1 and 2 are considered sequence-based models
because they are special cases of HMMs with transitions that do
not depend on previous states.
difficult to implement. As a result, many practition-
ers use the complex GIZA++ software package (Och
and Ney, 2003) as a black box, selecting model 4 as
a good compromise between alignment quality and
efficiency.
Even though the fertility-based models are more
accurate, there are several reasons to consider av-
enues for improvement based on the simpler and
faster sequence-based models. First, even with
the highly optimized implementations in GIZA++,
models 3 and above are still very slow to train. Sec-
ond, we seem to have hit a point of diminishing re-
turns with extensions to the fertility-based models.
For example, gains from the new model 6 of Och
and Ney (2003) are modest. When models are too
complex to reimplement, the barrier to improvement
is raised even higher. Finally, the fertility-based
models are asymmetric, and symmetrization is com-
monly employed to improve alignment quality by
intersecting alignments induced in each translation
direction. It is therefore natural to explore models
which are designed from the start with symmetry in
mind.
In this paper, we introduce a new method for word
alignment that addresses the three issues above. Our
development is motivated by the observation that in-
tersecting the predictions of two directional models
outperforms each model alone. Viewing intersec-
tion as a way of finding predictions that both models
agree on, we take the agreement idea one step fur-
ther. The central idea of our approach is to not only
make the predictions of the models agree at test time,
but also encourage agreement during training. We
define an intuitive objective function which incor-
104
porates both data likelihood and a measure of agree-
ment between models. Then we derive an EM-like
algorithm to maximize this objective function. Be-
cause the E-step is intractable in our case, we use
a heuristic approximation which nonetheless works
well in practice.
By jointly training two simple HMM models, we
obtain 4.9% AER on the standard English-French
Hansards task. To our knowledge, this is the lowest
published unsupervised AER result, and it is com-
petitive with supervised approaches. Furthermore,
our approach is very practical: it is no harder to
implement than a standard HMM model, and joint
training is no slower than the standard training of
two HMM models. Finally, we show that word
alignments from our system can be used in a phrase-
based translation system to modestly improve BLEU
score.
2 Alignment models: IBM 1, 2 and HMM
We briefly review the sequence-based word align-
ment models (Brown et al, 1994; Och and Ney,
2003) and describe some of the choices in our
implementation. All three models are generative
models of the form p(f | e) = ?a p(a, f | e),
where e = (e1, . . . , eI) is the English sentence,
f = (f1, . . . , fJ) is the French sentence, and a =
(a1, . . . , aJ ) is the (asymmetric) alignment which
specifies the position of an English word aligned to
each French word. All three models factor in the
following way:
p(a, f | e) =
J
?
j=1
pd(aj | aj? , j)pt(fj | eaj ), (1)
where j? is the position of the last non-null-aligned
French word before position j.2
The translation parameters pt(fj | eaj ) are pa-
rameterized by an (unsmoothed) lookup table that
stores the appropriate local conditional probability
distributions. The distortion parameters pd(aj = i? |
aj? = i) depend on the particular model (we write
aj = 0 to denote the event that the j-th French word

first-order HMM (see Och and Ney (2003)).
is null-aligned):
pd(aj =0 | aj?= i) = p0
pd(aj = i? 6= 0 | aj?= i) ?
(1? p0) ?
?
?
?
?
?
1 (IBM 1)
c(i??b jIJ c) (IBM 2)
c(i??i) (HMM),
where p0 is the null-word probability and c(?) con-
tains the distortion parameters for each offset argu-
ment. We set the null-word probability p0 = 1I+1
depending on the length of the English sentence,
which we found to be more effective than using a
constant p0.
In model 1, the distortion pd(? | ?) specifies a uni-
form distribution over English positions. In model
2, pd(? | ?) is still independent of aj? , but it can now
depend on j and i? through c(?). In the HMM model,
there is a dependence on aj? = i, but only through
c(i? i?).
We parameterize the distortion c(?) using a multi-
nomial distribution over 11 offset buckets c(?
?5), c(?4), . . . , c(4), c(? 5).3 We use three sets of
distortion parameters, one for transitioning into the
first state, one for transitioning out of the last state,
and one for all other transitions. This works better
than using a single set of parameters or ignoring the
transitions at the two ends.
3 Training by agreement
To motivate our joint training approach, we first
consider the standard practice of intersecting align-
ments. While the English and French sentences
play a symmetric role in the word alignment task,
sequence-based models are asymmetric: they are
generative models of the form p(f | e) (E?F), or
p(e | f) (F?E) by reversing the roles of source and
target. In general, intersecting the alignment predic-
tions of two independently-trained directional mod-
els reduces AER, e.g., from 11% to 7% for HMM
models (Table 2). This suggests that two models
make different types of errors that can be eliminated
upon intersection. Figure 1 (top) shows a common
type of error that intersection can partly remedy. In
3For each sentence, the probability mass of each of the two
end buckets c(??5) or c(? 5) is uniformly divided among
those valid offsets.

overall Precision/Recall/AER on the development set is given. See Section 4 for details.
this example, COJO is a rare word that becomes a
garbage collector (Moore, 2004) for the models in
both directions. Intersection eliminates the spurious
alignments, but at the expense of recall.
Intersection after training produces alignments
that both models agree on. The joint training pro-
cedure we describe below builds on this idea by en-
couraging the models to agree during training. Con-
sider the output of the jointly trained HMMs in Fig-
ure 1 (bottom). The garbage-collecting rare word is
no longer a problem. Not only are the individual
E?F and F?E jointly-trained models better than
their independently-trained counterparts, the jointly-
trained intersected model also provides a signifi-
cant overall gain over the independently-trained in-
tersected model. We maintain both high precision
and recall.
Before we introduce the objective function for
joint training, we will write the two directional mod-
els in a symmetric way so that they share the same
106
alignment spaces. We first replace the asymmetric
alignments a with a set of indicator variables for
each potential alignment edge (i, j): z = {zij ?
{0, 1} : 1 ? i ? I, 1 ? j ? J}. Each z can be
thought of as an element in the set of generalized
alignments, where any subset of word pairs may be
aligned (Och and Ney, 2003). Sequence-based mod-
els p(a | e, f) induce a distribution over p(z | e, f)
by letting p(z | e, f) = 0 for any z that does not
correspond to any a (i.e., if z contains many-to-one
alignments).
We also introduce the more compact notation
x = (e, f) to denote an input sentence pair. We
put arbitrary distributions p(e) and p(f) to remove
the conditioning, noting that this has no effect on
the optimization problem in the next section. We
can now think of the two directional sequence-based
models as each inducing a distribution over the
same space of sentence pairs and alignments (x, z):
p1(x, z; ?1) = p(e)p(a, f | e; ?1)
p2(x, z; ?2) = p(f)p(a, e | f ; ?2).
3.1 A joint objective
In the next two sections, we describe how to jointly
train the two models using an EM-like algorithm.
We emphasize that this technique is quite general
and can be applied in many different situations
where we want to couple two tractable models over
input x and output z.
To train two models p1(x, z; ?1) and p2(x, z; ?2)
independently, we maximize the data likelihood
?
x pk(x; ?k) =
?
x
?
z pk(x, z; ?k) of each model
separately, k ? {1, 2}:
max
?1,?2
?
x
[log p1(x; ?1) + log p2(x; ?2)] . (2)
Above, the summation over x enumerates the sen-
tence pairs in the training data.
There are many possible ways to quantify agree-
ment between two models. We chose a particularly
simple and mathematically convenient measure ?
the probability that the alignments produced by the
two models agree on an example x:
?
z
p1(z | x; ?1)p2(z | x; ?2).
We add the (log) probability of agreement to the
standard log-likelihood objective to couple the two
models:

?1,?2
?
x
[log p1(x; ?1) + log p2(x; ?2) +
log

z
p1(z | x; ?1)p2(z | x; ?2)]. (3)
3.2 Optimization via EM
We first review the EM algorithm for optimizing a
single model, which consists of iterating the follow-
ing two steps:
E : q(z;x) := p(z | x; ?),
M : ?? := argmax
?
?
x,z
q(z;x) log p(x, z; ?).
In the E-step, we compute the posterior distribution
of the alignments q(z;x) given the sentence pair x
and current parameters ?. In the M-step, we use ex-
pected counts with respect to q(z;x) in the maxi-
mum likelihood update ? := ??.
To optimize the objective in Equation 3, we can
derive a similar and simple procedure. See the ap-
pendix for the derivation.
E: q(z;x) := 1Zxp1(z | x; ?1)p2(z | x; ?2),
M: ?? = argmax
?
?
x,z
q(z;x) log p1(x, z; ?1)
+
?
x,z
q(z;x) log p2(x, z; ?2),
where Zx is a normalization constant. The M-step
decouples neatly into two independent optimization
problems, which lead to single model updates using
the expected counts from q(z;x). To compute Zx in
the E-step, we must sum the product of two model
posteriors over the set of possible zs with nonzero
probability under both models. In general, if both
posterior distributions over the latent variables z
decompose in the same tractable manner, as in
the context-free grammar induction work of Klein
and Manning (2004), the summation could be
carried out efficiently, for example using dynamic
programming. In our case, we would have to sum
over the set of alignments where each word in
English is aligned to at most one word in French
and each word in French is aligned to at most one
107
word in English. Unfortunately, for even very
simple models such as IBM 1 or 2, computing the
normalization constant over this set of alignments
is a #P -complete problem, by a reduction from
counting matchings in a bipartite graph (Valiant,
1979). We could perhaps attempt to compute q us-
ing a variety of approximate probabilistic inference
techniques, for example, sampling or variational
methods. With efficiency as our main concern, we
opted instead for a simple heuristic procedure by
letting q be a product of marginals:
q(z;x) :=
?
i,j
p1(zij | x; ?1)p2(zij | x; ?2),
where each pk(zij | x; ?k) is the posterior marginal
probability of the (i, j) edge being present (or ab-
sent) in the alignment according to each model,
which can be computed separately and efficiently.
Now the new E-step only requires simple
marginal computations under each of the mod-
els. This procedure is very intuitive: edges on
which the models disagree are discounted in the E-
step because the product of the marginals p1(zij |
x; ?1)p2(zij | x; ?2) is small. Note that in general,
this new procedure is not guaranteed to increase our
joint objective. Nonetheless, our experimental re-
sults show that it provides an effective method of
achieving model agreement and leads to significant
accuracy gains over independent training.
3.3 Prediction
Once we have trained two models, either jointly
or independently, we must decide how to combine
those two models to predict alignments for new sen-
tences.
First, let us step back to the case of one model.
Typically, the Viterbi alignment argmaxz p(z | x)
is used. An alternative is to use posterior decoding,
where we keep an edge (i, j) if the marginal edge
posterior p(zij | x) exceeds some threshold 0 < ? <
1. In symbols, z = {zij = 1 : p(zij = 1 | x) ? ?}.4
Posterior decoding has several attractive advan-
tages over Viterbi decoding. Varying the threshold
? gives a natural way to tradeoff precision and re-
call. In fact, these posteriors could be used more di-
4See Matusov et al (2004) for an alternative use of these
marginals.
rectly in extracting phrases for phrase-based trans-
lation. Also, when we want to combine two mod-
els for prediction, finding the Viterbi alignment
argmaxz p1(z | x)p2(z | x) is intractable for
HMM models (by a reduction from quadratic as-
signment), and a hard intersection argmaxz1 p1(z1 |
x) ? argmaxz2 p2(z2 | x) might be too sparse.
On the other hand, we can threshold the product of
two edge posteriors quite easily: z = {zij = 1 :
p1(zij = 1 | x)p2(zij = 1 | x) ? ?}.
We noticed a 5.8% relative reduction in AER (for
our best model) by using posterior decoding with a
validation-set optimized threshold ? instead of using
hard intersection of Viterbi alignments.
4 Experiments
We tested our approach on the English-French
Hansards data from the NAACL 2003 Shared Task,
which includes a training set of 1.1 million sen-
tences, a validation set of 37 sentences, and a test set
of 447 sentences. The validation and test sentences
have been hand-aligned (see Och and Ney (2003))
and are marked with both sure and possible align-
ments. Using these alignments, alignment error rate
(AER) is calculated as:
(
1? |A ? S|+ |A ? P ||A|+ |S|
)
? 100%,
where A is a set of proposed edges, S is the sure
gold edges, and P is the possible gold edges.
As a preprocessing step, we lowercased all words.
Then we used the validation set and the first 100 sen-
tences of the test set as our development set to tune
our models. Lastly, we ran our models on the last
347 sentences of the test set to get final AER results.
4.1 Basic results
We trained models 1, 2, and HMM on the Hansards
data. Following past work, we initialized the trans-
lation probabilities of model 1 uniformly over word
pairs that occur together in some sentence pair.
Models 2 and HMM were initialized with uni-
form distortion probabilities and model 1 translation
probabilities. Each model was trained for 5 itera-
tions, using the same training regimen as in Och and
Ney (2003).

and joint training across different size training sets
and different models, evaluated on the development

AER.
Table 1 shows a summary of the performance of
independently and jointly trained models under var-
ious training conditions. Quite remarkably, for all
training data sizes and all of the models, we see
an appreciable reduction in AER, especially on the
HMM models. We speculate that since the HMM
model provides a richer family of distributions over
alignments than either models 1 or 2, we can learn
to synchronize the predictions of the two models,
whereas models 1 and 2 have a much more limited
capacity to synchronize.
Table 2 shows the HMM models compared to
model 4 alignments produced by GIZA++ on the test
set. Our jointly trained model clearly outperforms
not only the standard HMM but also the more com-
plex IBM 4 model. For these results, the threshold
used for posterior decoding was tuned on the devel-
opment set. ?GIZA HMM? and ?HMM, indep? are
the same algorithm but differ in implementation de-
tails. The E?F and F?E models benefit a great
deal by moving from independent to joint training,
and the combined models show a smaller improve-
ment.
Our best performing model differs from standard
IBM word alignment models in two ways. First and
most importantly, we use joint training instead of

independent training, which gives us a huge boost.
The second change, which is more minor and or-
thogonal, is using posterior decoding instead of
Viterbi decoding, which also helps performance for
model 2 and HMM, but not model 1. Table 3 quan-
tifies the contribution of each of these two dimen-
sions.
Posterior decoding In our results, we have tuned
our threshold to minimize AER. It turns out that
AER is relatively insensitive to the threshold as Fig-
ure 2 shows. There is a large range from 0.2 to 0.5
where posterior decoding outperforms Viterbi de-
coding.
Initialization and convergence In addition to im-
proving performance, joint training also enjoys cer-
tain robustness properties. Specialized initialization
is absolutely crucial for an independently-trained

HMM model. If we initialize the HMM model with
uniform translation parameters, the HMM converges
to a completely senseless local optimum with AER
above 50%. Initializing the HMM with model 1 pa-
rameters alleviates this problem.
On the other hand, if we jointly train two HMMs
starting from a uniform initialization, the HMMs
converge to a surprisingly good solution. On the full
training set, training two HMMs jointly from uni-
form initialization yields 5.7% AER, only slightly
higher than 5.2% AER using model 1 initialization.
We suspect that the agreement term of the objective
forces the two HMMs to avoid many local optima
that each one would have on its own, since these lo-
cal optima correspond to posteriors over alignments
that would be very unlikely to agree. We also ob-
served that jointly trained HMMs converged very
quickly?in 5 iterations?and did not exhibit over-
fitting with increased iterations.
Common errors The major source of remaining
errors are recall errors that come from the shortcom-
ings of the HMM model. The E?F model gives 0
probability to any many-to-one alignments and the
F?E model gives 0 probability to any one-to-many
alignments. By enforcing agreement, the two mod-
els are effectively restricted to one-to-one (or zero)
alignments. Posterior decoding is in principle ca-
pable of proposing many-to-many alignments, but
these alignments occur infrequently since the poste-
riors are generally sharply peaked around the Viterbi
alignment. In some cases, however, we do get one-
to-many alignments in both directions.
Another common type of errors are precision er-
rors due to the models overly-aggressively prefer-
ring alignments that preserve monotonicity. Our
HMM model only uses 11 distortion parameters,
which means distortions are not sensitive to the lex-
ical context of the sentences. For example, in one
sentence, le is incorrectly aligned to the as a mono-
tonic alignment following another pair of correctly
aligned words, and then the monotonicity is broken
immediately following le?the. Here, the model is
insensitive to the fact that alignments following arti-
cles tend to be monotonic, but alignments preceding
articles are less so.
Another phenomenon is the insertion of ?stepping
stone? alignments. Suppose two edges (i, j) and
(i+4, j+4) have a very high probability of being in-
cluded in an alignment, but the words between them
are not good translations of each other. If the inter-
vening English words were null-aligned, we would
have to pay a big distortion penalty for jumping 4
positions. On the other hand, if the edge (i+2, j+2)
were included, that penalty would be mitigated. The
translation cost for forcing that edge is smaller than
the distortion cost.
4.2 BLEU evaluation
To see whether our improvement in AER also im-
proves BLEU score, we aligned 100K English-
French sentences from the Europarl corpus and
tested on 3000 sentences of length 5?15. Using
GIZA++ model 4 alignments and Pharaoh (Koehn
et al, 2003), we achieved a BLEU score of 0.3035.
By using alignments from our jointly trained HMMs
instead, we get a BLEU score of 0.3051. While this
improvement is very modest, we are currently inves-
tigating alternative ways of interfacing with phrase
table construction to make a larger impact on trans-
lation quality.
5 Related Work
Our approach is similar in spirit to co-training,
where two classifiers, complementary by the virtue
of having different views of the data, are trained
jointly to encourage agreement (Blum and Mitchell,
1998; Collins and Singer, 1999). One key difference
110
in our work is that we rely exclusively on data like-
lihood to guide the two models in an unsupervised
manner, rather than relying on an initial handful of
labeled examples.
The idea of exploiting agreement between two la-
tent variable models is not new; there has been sub-
stantial previous work on leveraging the strengths
of two complementary models. Klein and Man-
ning (2004) combine two complementary mod-
els for grammar induction, one that models con-
stituency and one that models dependency, in a man-
ner broadly similar to the current work. Aside from
investigating a different domain, one novel aspect of
this paper is that we present a formal objective and a
training algorithm for combining two generic mod-
els.
6 Conclusion
We have described an efficient and fully unsuper-
vised method of producing state-of-the-art word
alignments. By training two simple sequence-based
models to agree, we achieve substantial error re-
ductions over standard models. Our jointly trained
HMM models reduce AER by 29% over test-time
intersected GIZA++ model 4 alignments and also
increase our robustness to varying initialization reg-
imens. While AER is only a weak indicator of final
translation quality in many current translation sys-
tems, we hope that more accurate alignments can
eventually lead to improvements in the end-to-end
translation process.

Appendix: Derivation of agreement EM
To simplify notation, we drop the explicit reference
to the parameters ?. Lower bound the objective in
Equation 3 by introducing a distribution q(z;x) and
using the concavity of log:
X
x
log p1(x)p2(x)
X
z
p1(z | x)p2(z | x) (4)
?
X
x,z
q(z;x) log p1(x)p2(x)p1(z | x)p2(z | x)q(z;x) (5)
=
X
x,z
q(z;x) log p1(z | x)p2(z | x)q(z;x) + C (6)
=
X
x,z
q(z;x) log p1(x, z)p2(x, z) + D, (7)
where C depends only on ? but not q and D de-
pends only q but not ?. The E-step chooses q given
a fixed ? to maximize the lower bound. Equation 6
is exactly
?
x?KL(q||p1p2) + C , which is maxi-
mized by setting q proportional to p1p2. The M-step
chooses ? given a fixed q. Equation 7 decomposes
into two separate optimization problems.
