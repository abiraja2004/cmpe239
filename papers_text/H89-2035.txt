ABSTRACT 
In practical large vocabulary speech recognition systems, 
it is nearly impossible for a speaker to remember which 
words are in the vocabulary. The probability of the 
speaker using words outside the vocabulary can be quite 
high. For the case when a speaker uses a new word, cur- 
rent systems will always" recognize other words within 
the vocabulary in place of the new word, and the speaker 
wouldn't know what the problem is. 
In this paper, we describe a preliminary investigation 
of techniques that automatically detect when the speaker 
has used a word that is not in the vocabulary. We de- 
veloped a technique that uses a general model for the 
acoustics of any word to recognize the existence of new 
words. Using this general word model, we measure the 
correct detection of new words versus the false alarm 
rate. 
Experiments were run using the DARPA 1000-word 
Resource Management Database for continuous peech 
recognition. The recognition system used is the BBN 
BYBLOS continuous peech recognition system (Chow 
et al. 1987). The preliminary results indicate a detection 
rate of 74% with a false alarm rate of 3.4%. 
I THE NEW WORD PROBLEM 
The current continuous peech recognition systems are 
designed to recognize words within the vocabulary of 
the system. When a new word is spoken they recognize 
other words that are in the vocabulary in place of the 
new word. When this happens, the user does not know 
that the problem is that one of the words spoken is not in 
the vocabulary. He assumes that the system simply mis- 
recognized the word, and therefore he says the sentence 
again and again. The current systems do not tell the user 
what the problem is, which could be very frustrating. 
Adding the ability to detect new words automaticly 
can be very efficient and will improve the performance 
of the system. Once a new word is detected it is possible 
to add the word to the vocabulary with some extra in- 
formation from the user such as repeating the word with 
a carrier phrase and typing in the spellmg of the word. 
2 APPROACH 
The obvious zero-order solution for this problem is to 
apply some rejection threshold on the word score. If the 
score reaches a level higher than the threshold then a 
new word is detected. However, when we examined the 
scores of words in a sentence, we found that the score 
of correct words varies widely, making it impossible to 
tell whether a word is correct or not. Therefore, this 
approach for detecting new words did not work well. 
Our proposed solution is to develop an explicit model 
of new words that will be detected whenever a new word 
occurs. The word model should be general enough to 
represent any new word. It should score better than other 
words in the vocabulary in place of new words only. It 
should not appear in place of already existing words in 
the vocabulary. We tried two acoustic models of new 
words which are described below. 
The first word model we tried was a new word model 
with a minimum 'of four phonemes long. It is a linear 
word model of 5 states and 4 identical phonemes with flat 
spectral distribution. The results were not encouraging 
due to the high false alarm rate and low detection rate. 
The second word model that we tried was a word 
model that allows for any sequence of phonemes of at 
least two phonemes long. The model has 3 states, all 
263 
phonemes in parallel from the first state to the second 
state, all phonemes in parallel from the second state to 
the third state and all phonemes in parallel ooping on 
the second state. All phonemes are context independent 
phonemes. Note that this is in contrast o the normal 
vocabulary of the system, which uses context dependent 
phoneme models. 
We used a statistical class grammar to make the de- 
tection process more useful, and created a new word 
model for each open class. Open classes are the classes 
that accept new words (e.g. ship names, port names) as 
opposed to closed classes that do not accept new words 
(e.g. months, week-days, digits). By using separate new 
word models for the open classes we can make the dis- 
traction whether the new word was a ship name or a port 
name, etc. Also, it is easy to add the open class words 
to statistical class grammars and to Natural Language 
syntax and semantics. 
3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
We presented new words to the system, simply by re- 
moving words, that occur m the test sentences, from the 
vocabulary. We give results for experiments that used 
the three state acoustic model for new words. The ex- 
periments were run on 7 speakers, 25 test sentences per 
speaker, from the May 88 test which are BEF, CMR, 
DMS, DTB, DTD, JWS and PGH. We varied the per- 
plexity of the statistical class grammars imply by chang- 
ing the number of training sentences. A bias against new 
words was implemented to reduce the false alarm rate. 
Our first experiment was detecting new ship names 
or new ship names possessive. The perplexity of the 
grammar was 100. We had a detection rate of 83% and 
a false alarm rate of 1.7%. In the second experiment we 
changed the perplexity of rite grammar to 60 to measure 
the effect of the perplexity on the detection rate and the 
false alarm rate. There was no significant difference in 
the detection rate (84%) but the false alarm rate dropped 
to 1.1%. 
Our third experiment was detecting new port names 
with grammar of perplexity 100. We had a detection 
rate of 64% and a false alarm rate of 0.6%. 
In the fourth experiment we tried to detect new words 
from 7 different classes which are ship name, ship name 
possessive, port name, water name, land name, capabil- 
ity and track name. The grammar had a perplexity of 
100. The detection rate was 74% and the false alarm 
rate was 3.4%. 
We measured the detection rate versus the false alarm 
rate for each experiment. The results are tabulated in 
table I. The columns in the table are described then 
followed by an example as an illustration: 
? new words: the new words were allowed in the 
following classes. 
? perp: the peqalexity of the grammar. 
? cr: exact detect ionram as a pementa~ o fnumber

Table 1: Detection of new words results 
While we would like the system to detect he exact 
location and the class of the new words, it is also useful 
to simply detect hat a new word occured. Thus we say 
that 74% of the time the system was able to inform the 
user that a new word had been used. 
4 CONCLUSION 
From the above results we conclude that the problem 
of detecting new words can be solved by selecting an 
appropriate word model for new words. In these exper- 
iments we have proved that this approach is viable and 
results in a detection rate of 74% and a false alarm rate 
of 3.4%. These results also suggest hat a better word 
model can be used to enhance the detection rate. The 
use of a bias helps reduce the false alarm rate without 
aftecting the detection rate significantly. Changing the 
perplexity of the class grammar did not affect the de- 
tection rate significantly but it reduced 35% of the false 
alarm rate.
