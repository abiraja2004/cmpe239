The aim of  the paper i s  to  d i scuss  severa l  i ssues  that  
usua l ly  occur  when computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  comes in to  in ter -  
ac t ions  w i th  so rap id ly  growing s~eas of  a r t i f i c ia l  in te l l ig -  
ence as i t  can be seen e .g .  in  des ign ing  exper t  and consu l t ing  
systems or in  the  area  of  automated programming of  knowledge- 
-based problem so lv ing  systems.  We w i l l  ment ion here problems 
of  communicating knowledge between machine and researcher  (a  
user  of  a system) which i s  not an expert  in  programming tech-  
h iquev S ince natura l  l an~a~e i s  a "natura l "  form fo r  express -  
tng  knowledge (and most ext ramathemat ica l  knowledge actua l ly  
ex i s ts  in  th i s  form) i t  could be seemed that  natura l  language 
would be a l so  the best  support  fo r  communicating knowledge 
through a cogn i t ive  process  performed on a computer.  I s  I t  
rea l ly  so? We want to b r ing  arguments fo r  a ra ther  oppos i te  
c la im by po in ted  ou~ severa l  fo rmats  fo r  express ing  and commun- 
toat in~ sc ient i f i c  knowledge which d i f fe rs  from usua l  natura l

What k inds o f  data s t ruc tures  fo r  express ing  knowledge 
and fo r  represent ing  i t  in  a computer memory we need? For 
answering th i s  quest ion  we have to  d i s t i~p- i sh  at  leas t  two 
ro les  o f  a user  in  the  process  o f  conmmnication w i th  machine. 
F i r s t  of  them can be ca l led  a speaker  t I t  character i zes  the  
s i tuat ion  in  which the user  loads  knowledge in to  a machine. 
For  such a s i tuat ion  there  i s  important  that  knowledge enter -  
- 142  - 
i ng  a computer should be prec i se  and exact  as much as poss ib -  
le .  So the data s t ruc tures  should enable d isambtguat ion  of  
in fo rmat ion .  Such a requ i rement  leads  natura l ly  to  hard con-  
s t ra in ts  of  input  fo rmats .  On the o ther  hand, not only fo r  
the user  conven ience,  i t  should be des i rab le  to  a l low h igh ly  
f ree  format of  input  in fo rmat ion  to avo id  any apr io r i  l im i ta t -  
i ons .  Thus, the system should be equipped by an e f fec t ive  
in terpreter  t rans forming  var ious  k inds of  input  in fo rmat ion  
in to  in terna l  representat ion  su i tab le  fo r  potent ia l  reason ing  
processes .  The second ro le  of  the user  in  communication w i th  
computer can be ca l led  a l i s tener~ This s i tuat ion  i s  ra ther  
d i f fe rent  from the f i r s t  one. Here the user  has to under -  
stand resu l t s  of  computat ions and (espec ia l l y  in  Oonsu l t ing  
systems) a lso  var ious  exp lanat ions  resu l t ing  from reason ing  
processes .  These two ro les  can, of  course ,  in f i l t ra te  one in to  
another .  Analogous ro les  can be recogn ized  fo r  a machine, too .  
As a teethed  fo r  our cons iderat ions  an AI p rob lem-or ient -  
ed designed fo r  an automat ic  data  ana lys i s  (ca l led  GUHA-80) 
has been chosen. The task  of  GUHA-80 system i s  to  generate  and 
develop in teres t ing  views onto g iven  empi r i ca l  data ( recogn i -  
ze tn teres t in~ log ica l  pat te rns ) .  These views should represent  
re levant  in fo rmat ion  conta ined in  the data  and be use fu l  fo r  
fo rmat ion  of hypotheses .  
From the po int  of  v iew of  two above mentioned ro les  of  
user  the fo l low ing  types  of  in fo rmat ion  in  the GUHA-80 system 
could be disttn&-tttshed: 
1. In fo rmat ion  coming in to  system could conta in  a) data  
(observat ions  on ob jec ts ) ,  b) suppor t ing  knowledge (apr io r t  
knowledge about the problem in  quest ion ,  answers of quest ions ) .  
2. In fo rmat ion  coming from the system could conta in  a) 
t race  o f  computat ions and reason ing  ac t iv i t ies ,  b) resu l t s  of  
computat ions,  c) exp lanat ions  (why such and such operat ions  
have been per formed) ,  c f .  ~CIN.

Let us g ive  a hypothet i ca l  example o f  user ' s  communicat- 
i on  with GUHA-80 system: 
GUHA-80: by a sing~le l inkage  method us ing  euc l id ian  d i s tance  
on the set  of  ob jec ts  the  fo l low ing  dendro~am 
express ing  the s imi la r i ty  between these  ob jec ts  was 
obta ined:  
AnX 
CDX 
I s  the dendogram in  accordance wi th  your knowledge? 
USER:  No. 
GUHA-80. May I suggest  another  pat tern  us ing  d i f fe rent  c lus t -  
e r ing  techn iques?  
USER: Yes. 
GUHA-SO: Do you pre fer  some of the  fo l low ing  techn iques :  (a  
tab le  o f  re levant  techn iques  fo l lows)  
I t  can be eas i ly  seen that  in  such a conversat ion  d i f fe rent  
leve ls  of  unders tand ing  language are  needed. NL leve l  w i l l  be 
appropr ia te  main ly  fo r  user ' s  answers,  s imple  quest ions e tc .  
But t ry  to  express  the in fo rmat ion  oonta inqd in  the  dend~o- 
gram in  NL form! Moreover,  fo r  oommun~cation process  from 
GUHA-80 to the  user  i t  w i l l  be typ ica l  a ~raphio representat -  
i on  of  in fo rmat ion  (which in  many cases  i s  more t ransparent  
than ~L one) .  
Thus the language unders tand ing  take p lace  main ly  in  the  
case sub lb) i .e .  when enter ing  suppor t ing  knowledge. But fo r  
p rac t i ca l  reasons i t  can be performed in  a very  s imple leve l  
as e .g .  in  very  h igh leve l  programmAng languages .  Examples 
INPUT PORNAT IS ~( )'. VARIABLES ARE 25. CASES ARE I02. 
VARIABLE hL%MES ARE ... , PRINT CORRELATIONSo

In  each case ,  such an unders tand ingmuet  lead  to 
1. to  the e l im inat ion  of  redundant in fo rmat ion  and in  
such a way to the core of  a s ta tement !  
2.  to  the poss ib i l i ty  to  work only  wi th  minimal cores  
of statements. 
The reason fo r  a second requ i rement  i s  that  a user  
exper ienced wi th  the system tend~to rep lace  syntact i c  sugar  
by an appropr ia te  s lang  to minimize h ie  e f foz~pa/d  e .g .  to  
punchin~ or  typ ing  s ta tements .  
Conc lus ion,  We have d i s t ingu ished  d i f fe rent  types  of  
communication of  sc ient i f i c  knowledge through a mechanized 
cogn i t ive  process .  I t  l eads  f i r s t  to  the c la im that  not only 
d i f fe rent  leve ls  of  unders tand ing  language but a l so  a i f fe rent  
leve ls  of  verbos i ty  e~e needed.  Moreoverp in  some c~sesthe  ; 
use o f  verba l  in fo rmat ion  can be undes i rab le  or  even imposs ib -  
le .  Horeover,  in  many cases when unders tand ing  lance  i s  ~- 
needed i t  would be enough to understand only a smal l  re levant  
fragment of  It. -i
