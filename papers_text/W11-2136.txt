Abstract
We present a translation model enriched with
shallow syntactic and semantic information
about the source language. Base-phrase la-
bels and semantic role labels are incorporated
into an hierarchical model by creating shal-
low semantic ?trees?. Results show an in-
crease in performance of up to 6% in BLEU
scores for English-Spanish translation over a
standard phrase-based SMT baseline.
1 Introduction
The use of semantic information to improve Statis-
tical Machine Translation (SMT) is a very recent re-
search topic that has been attracting significant at-
tention. In this paper we describe our participation
in the shared translation task of the 6th Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) with a sys-
tem that incorporates shallow syntactic and semantic
information into hierarchical SMT models.
The system is based on the Moses toolkit (Hoang
et al, 2009; Koehn et al, 2007) using hierarchi-
cal models informed with shallow syntactic (chunks)
and semantic (semantic role labels) information for
the source language. The toolkit SENNA (Collobert
et al, 2011) is used to provide base-phrases (chunks)
and semantic role labels.
Experiments with English-Spanish and English-
German news datasets show promising results and
highlight important issues about the use of seman-
tic information in hierarchical models as well as a
number of possible directions for further research.
The remaining of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 presents related work; Section 3 de-
scribes the method; Section 4 presents the results ob-
tained for the English-Spanish and English-German
translation tasks; and Section 5 brings some conclu-
sions and directions for further research.
2 Related Work
In hierarchical SMT (Chiang, 2005), a Synchronous
Context Free Grammar (SCFG) is learned from a
parallel corpus.The model capitalizes on the recur-
sive nature of language replacing sub-phrases by
an unlabeled nonterminal. Hierarchical models are
known to produce high coverage rules, once they are
only constrained by the word alignment. Neverthe-
less the lack of specialized vocabulary also leads to
spurious ambiguity (Chiang, 2005).
Syntax-based models are hierarchical models
whose rules are constrained by syntactic informa-
tion.The syntactic constraints have an impact in
the rule extraction process, reducing drastically the
number of rules available to the system. While this
may be helpful to reduce ambiguity, it can lead to
poorer performance (Ambati and Lavie, 2008).
Motivated by the fact that syntactically constrain-
ing a hierarchical model can decrease translation
quality, some attempts to overcome the problems
at rule extraction time have been made. Venugopal
and Zollmann (2006) propose a heuristic method to
relax parse trees known as Syntax Augmented Ma-
chine Translation (SAMT). Significant gains are ob-
tained by grouping nonterminals under categories
when they do not span across syntactic constituents.
Hoang and Koehn (2010) propose a soft syntax-
based model which combines the precision of a
syntax-constrained model with the coverage of an
316
unconstrained hierarchical model. Instead of hav-
ing heuristic strategies to combine nonterminals in a
parse tree, whenever a rule cannot be retrieved be-
cause it does not span a constituent, the extraction
procedure falls back to the hierarchical approach, re-
trieving a rule with unlabeled nonterminals. Perfor-
mance gains are reported over standard hierarchical
models using both full parse trees and shallow syn-
tax.
Moving beyond syntactic information, some at-
tempts have recently been made to add semantic an-
notations to SMT. Wu and Fung (2009) present a
two-pass model to incorporate semantic information
to the phrase-based SMT pipeline. The method per-
forms conventional translation in a first step, fol-
lowed by a constituent reordering step seeking to
maximize the cross-lingual match of the semantic
role labels of the translation and source sentences.
Liu and Gildea (2010) add features extracted from
the source sentences annotated with semantic role
labels in a tree-to-string SMT model. They mod-
ify a syntax-based SMT system in order to penal-
ize/reward role reordering and role deletion. The
input sentence is parsed for semantic roles and the
roles are then projected onto the target side using
word alignment information at decoding time. They
assume that a one-to-one mapping between source
and target roles is desirable.
Baker et al (2010) propose to graft semantic in-
formation, namely named entities and modalities, to
syntactic tags in a syntax-based model. The vocab-
ulary of nonterminals is specialized using the se-
mantic categories, for instance, a noun phrase (NP)
whose head is a geopolitical entity (GPE) will be
tagged as NPGPE, making the rule table less am-
biguous.
Similar to (Baker et al, 2010) we specialize a vo-
cabulary of syntactic nonterminals with semantic in-
formation, however we use shallow syntax (base-
phrases) and semantic role labels instead of con-
stituent parse and named entities. The resulting shal-
low trees are relaxed following SAMT (Venugopal
and Zollmann, 2006). Different from previous work
we add the semantic knowledge at the level of the
corpus annotation. As a consequence, instead of bi-
asing deletion and reordering through additional fea-
tures (Liu and Gildea, 2010), we learn hierarchical
rules that encode those phenomena, taking also into
account the semantic role of base-phrases.
3 Proposed Method
The proposed method is based on an extension of the
hierarchical models in Moses using source language
information. Our submission included systems for
two language pairs: English-Spanish (en-es) and
English-German (en-de) and was constrained to us-
ing data provided by WMT11. Phrase and rule ex-
traction were performed using the entire en-es and
en-de portions of Europarl. Model parameters were
tuned using the news-test2008 dataset. Three 5-
gram Spanish and German language models were
trained using SRILM1 with the News Commentaries
(? 160K sentences), Europarl (? 2M sentences)
and News (? 5M sentences) corpora. These models
were interpolated using scripts provided in Moses
(Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).
At pre-processing stage, sentences longer than 80
tokens were filtered from the training/development
corpus. The parallel corpus was then tokenized and
truecased. Additionally, for en-de, compound split-
ting of the German side of the corpus was performed
using a frequency based method described in (Koehn
and Knight, 2003). This method helps alleviate spar-
sity, reducing the size of the vocabulary by decom-
posing compounds into their base words. Recas-
ing and detokenization, along with compound merg-
ing of the translations into German, were handled
at post-processing stage. Compound merging was
performed by finding the most likely sequences of
words to be merged into previously seen compounds
(Stymne, 2009).
3.1 Source Language Annotation
For rule extraction, training and test, the English side
of the corpus was annotated with Semantic Role La-
bels (SRL) using the toolkit SENNA2, which also
outputs POS and base-phrase (without prepositional
attachment) tags. The resulting source language an-
notation was used to produce trees in order to build
a tree-to-string model in Moses.

Figure 1: Example of POS tags and base-phrase annotation. Base-phrases: noun-phrase (NP), verb-phrase
(VP), prepositional-phrase (PP), adverbial-phrase (ADVP), outside-of-a-phrase (O)
In order to derive trees for the source side of the
corpus from this annotation, a new level is created to
add the POS tags for each word form. Syntactic tags
are then added by grouping words and POS tags into
base phrases using linguistic information as given
by SENNA. Figure 1 shows an example of an input
sentence annotated with POS and base-phrase infor-
mation. Additionally, SRLs are used to enrich the
POS and base-phrase annotation levels. Semantic
roles are assigned to each predicate independently.
As a consequence, the resulting annotation cannot
be considered a tree and there is not an obvious hi-
erarchy of predicates in a sentence. For example,
Figure 2 shows the SRL annotation for the example
in Figure 1.
[A0 He] [T intends] [A1 to donate this money to charity],
but he has not decided which yet
[A0 He] intends to [T donate] [A1 this money] [A2 to
charity], but he has not decided which yet
He intends to donate this money to charity, but [A0 he]
has [AM-NEG not] [T decided] [A1 which] [AM-TMP
yet]
Figure 2: SRL for sentence in Figure 1
Arguments of a single predicate never overlap,
however in longer sentences, the occurrence of mul-
tiple verbs increases the chances that arguments of
different predicates overlap, that is, the argument of
a verb might contain or even coincide with the argu-
ment of another verb and depending on the verb the
argument role might change. For example, in Fig-
ure 2: i) He is both the agent of intend and donate;
ii) this money is the donated thing and also part of
the chunk which express the intention (to donate this
money to charity). In a different example we can see
that arguments might overlap and their roles change
completely depending on their target predicates (e.g
in I gave you something to eat, you is the recipient
of the verb give and the agent of the verb eat). For
this reason, why semantic role labels are usually an-
notated individually in different structures, as shown
in Figure 2, each annotation focusing on a single tar-
get verb. In order to convert the predicates and argu-
ments of a sentence into a single tree, we enrich the
POS-tags and base-phrase annotation as follows:
? Semantic labels are directly grafted to the base-
phrase annotation whenever possible, that is,
if a predicate argument coincides with a sin-
gle base-phrase, the base-phrase type is spe-
cialized with the argument role. In Figure 3,
the noun-phrase (NP) the money is specialized
into NP:A1:donate, since that single NP is the
argument A1 of donate.
? If a predicate argument groups multiple base-
phrases, the semantic label applies to a node in
a new level of the tree subsuming all these base-
phrases. In Figure 3, the base-phrases to (PP)
and charity (NP) are grouped by A2:donate.
? We add the labels sequentially from the short-
est chunks to the largest ones. If two la-
bels spanning the same number of tokens: i)
overlap completely, we merge them so that
no hierarchy is imposed between their targets
(e.g. in Figure 3, the noun-phrase He is spe-
cialized into NP:A0:donate,intend); ii) over-
lap partially, we merge them so that the re-
sulting label will compete against other labels
in a different length category. If a label span-
ning a larger chunk overlaps partially with a
label spanning a shorter chunk, or contains it,
we stack them in a way that the first subsumes
the second (e.g in Figure 3, A1:intend sub-
sumes VP:T:donate, NP:A1:donate,intend and
A2:donate).
? Verb phrases might get split if they contain
multiple target predicates (e.g. in Figure 3,
the VP intends to donate is split into two verb-
318
phrases, each specialized with its own role la-
bel).
? Finally, tags are lexicalized, that is, semantic
labels are composed by their type (e.g. A0) and
target predicate lemma (verb).
Figure 3 shows and example of how semantic la-
bels are combined with shallow syntax in order to
produce the input tree for the sentence in Figure
1. The argument A1 of intend subsumes the target
verb donate and its arguments A1 and A2; A2:donate
groups base-phrases so as to attach the preposition to
the noun phrase.
Finally, following the method for syntactic trees
by Venugopal and Zollmann (2006), the input trees
are relaxed in order to alleviate the impact of the
linguistic constraints on rule extraction. We relax
trees3 by combining any pairs of neighboring nodes.
For example, NP:A0:donate,intend+VP:T:intend
and NP:A1:donate+A2:donate are created for the
tree in Figure 3.
4 Results
As a baseline to compare against our proposed ap-
proach (srl), we took a phrase-based SMT system
(pb) built using the Moses toolkit with the same
datasets and training conditions described in Sec-
tion 3. The results are reported in terms of standard
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) (and its case sensitive
version, BLEU-c) and tested for statistical signifi-
cance using an approximate randomization test (Rie-
zler and Maxwell, 2005) with 100 iterations.
In addition, we included an intermediate model
between these two: a hierarchical model in-
formed with source-language base-phrase informa-
tion (chunk). For the English-Spanish task we also
built a purely hierarchical model (hier) using Moses
and the same datasets and training conditions. For
the English-German task, hierarchical models have
not been shown to outperform standard phrase-based
models in previous work (Koehn et al, 2010).
Table 1 shows the performance achieved for the
English-Spanish translation task test set, where (srl)
is our official submission. One can notice a signifi-
cant gain in performance (up to 6% BLEU) in using
tree-based models (with or without source language

annotation) as opposed to using standard phrase-
based models.

The purely hierarchical approach performs as
well as our linguistically informed tree-based mod-
els (chunk and srl). On the one hand this finding
is somewhat disappointing as we expected that tree-
based models would benefit from linguistic annota-
tion. On the other hand it shows that the linguistic
annotation yields a significant reduction in the num-
ber of unnecessary productions: the linguistically in-
formed models are much smaller than hier (Table
5), but perform just as well. Whether the linguistic
annotation significantly helps make the productions
less ambiguous or not is still a question to be ad-
dressed in further experimentation.
Table 2 shows the performance achieved for the
English-German translation task test set. These re-
sults indicate that the linguistic information did not
lead to any significant gains in terms of automatic
metrics. An in-depth comparative analysis based on
a manual inspection of the translations remains to be
done.

Another somewhat disappoint result is the perfor-
mance of srl when compared to chunk. We believe
the main reason why the chunk models outperform
the srl models is data sparsity. The semantic infor-
mation, and particularly the way it was used in this
paper, with lexicalized roles, led to a very sparse
model. As an attempt to make the srl model less
sparse, we tested a version of this model without
lexicalizing the semantic tags, in other words, us-
ing the semantic role labels only, for example, A1
instead of A1:intend in Figure 3. Table 4 shows that
models with lexicalized semantic roles (lex) consis-
tently outperform the alternative version (non lex),
although the differences were only statistically sig-
nificant for the en-de dataset. One reason for that
may be that non-lexicalized rules do not help mak-

Table 5 shows how the additional annotation con-
strains the rule extraction (for the en-es dataset). The
unconstrained model hier presents the largest rule
table, followed by the chunk model, which is only
constrained by syntactic information. The models
enriched with semantic labels, both the lexicalized
or non-lexicalized versions, contain a comparable
number of rules. They are at least half the size of
the chunk model and about 9 times smaller than the
hier model. However, the number of nonterminals
in the lexicalized models highlights the sparsity of
such models.

Table 5: Statistics from the rule table
In order to exemplify the importance of having
320
some form of lexicalized information as part of the
semantic models, Figure 4 shows two predicates
which present different semantic roles, even though
they have nearly the same shallow syntactic struc-
ture. In this case, unless lexicalized, rules map-
ping semantic roles into base-phrases become am-
biguous. Besides, the same role might appear sev-
eral times in the same sentence (Figure 2). In this
case, if the semantic roles are not annotated with
their target lemma, they bring additional confusion.
Therefore, the model needs the lexical information
to distinguish role deletion and reordering phenom-
ena across predicates.

In WMT11?s official manual evaluation, our sys-
tem submissions (srl) were ranked 10th out of 15
systems in the English-Spanish task, and 18th out
of 22 systems participating in the English-German
task. For detailed results refer to the overview paper
of the Shared Translation Task of the Sixth Work-
shop on Machine Translation (WMT11).
5 Conclusions
We have presented an effort towards using shal-
low syntactic and semantic information for SMT.
The model based on shallow syntactic information
(chunk annotation) has significantly outperformed a
baseline phrase-based model and performed as well
as a hierarchical phrase-based model with a signifi-
cantly smaller number of translation rules.
While annotating base-phrases with semantic la-
bels is intuitively a promising research direction, the
current model suffers from sparsity and representa-
tion issues resulting from the fact that multiple pred-
icates share arguments within a given sentence. As
a consequence, shallow semantics has not yet shown
improvements with respect to the chunk-based mod-
els.
In future work, we will address the sparsity is-
sues in the lexicalized semantic models by cluster-
ing predicates in a way that semantic roles can be
specialized with semantic categories, instead of the
verb lemmas.
