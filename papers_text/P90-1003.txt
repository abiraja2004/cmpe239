We describe the modification of a grammar to take 
advantage of prosodic information provided by a 
speech recognition system. This initial study is lim- 
ited to the use of relative duration of phonetic seg- 
ments in the assignment ofsyntactic structure, specif- 
ically in ruling out alternative parses in otherwise 
ambiguous sentences. Taking advantage of prosodic 
information in parsing can make a spoken language 
system more accurate and more efficient, if prosodic- 
syntactic mismatches, or unlikely matches, can be 
pruned. We know of no other work that has suc- 
ceeded in automatically extracting speech informa- 
tion and using it in a parser to rule out extraneous 
parses. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Prosodic information can mark lexical stress, iden- 
tify phrasing breaks, and provide information useful 
for semantic interpretation. Each of these aspects of 
prosody can benefit a spoken language system (SLS). 
In this paper we describe the modification of a gram- 
mar to take advantage of prosodic information pro- 
vided by a speech component. Though prosody in- 
cludes a variety of acoustic phenomena used for a 
variety of linguistic effects, we limit this initial study 
to the use of relative duration of phonetic segments in
the assignment of syntactic structure, specifically in 
ruling out alternative parses in otherwise ambiguous 
sentences. 
It is rare that prosody alone disambiguates oth- 
erwise identical phrases. However, it is also rare 
that any one source of information is the sole feature 
that separates one phrase from all competitors. Tak- 
ing advantage ofprosodic information i parsing can 
make a spoken language system more accurate and 
more efficient, if prosodic-syntactic mismatches, or 
unlikely matches, can be pruned out. Prosodic struc- 
ture and syntactic structures are not, of course, com- 
pletely identical. Rhythmic structures and the neces- 
sity of breathing influence the prosodic structure, but 
not the syntactic structure (Gee and Grosjean 1983, 
Cooper and Paccia-Cooper 1980 ). Further, there are 
aspects of syntactic structure that are not typically 
marked prosodically. Our goal is to show that at least 
some prosodic information can be automatically ex- 
tracted and used to improve syntactic analysis. Other 
studies have pointed to possibilities for deriving syn- 
tax from prosody (see e.g., Gee and Grosjean 1983, 
Briscoe and Boguraev 1984, and Komatsu, Oohira, 
and Ichikawa 1989) but none to our knowledge have 
communicated speech information directly to a parser 
in a spoken language system. 
2 Corpus 
For our corpus of sentences we selected a subset of 
a corpus developed previously (see Price et aL 1989) 
for investigating the perceptual role of prosodic infor- 
mation in disambiguating sentences. A set of 35 pho- 
netically ambiguous sentence pairs of differing syntac- 
tic structure was recorded by professional FM radio 
news announcers. By phonetically ambiguous sen- 
tences, we mean sentences that consist of the same 
string of phones, i.e., that suprasegmental rather than 
segmental information is the basis for the distinction 
between members of the pairs. Members of the pairs 
were read in disambiguating contexts on days sepa- 
rated by a period of several weeks to avoid exagger- 
ation of the contrast. In the earlier study listeners 
viewed the two contexts while hearing one member 
of the pair, and were asked to select the appropriate 
context for the sentence. The results showed that lis- 
teners can, in general, reliably separate phonetically 
and syntactically ambiguous sentences on the basis 
of prosody. The original study investigated seven 
types of structural ambiguity. The present study 
used a subset of the sentence pairs which contained 
17 
prepositional phrase attachment ambiguities, or par- 
ticle/preposition ambiguities (see Appendix). 
If naive listeners can reliably separate phonetically 
and structurally ambiguous pairs, what is the basis 
for this separation? In related work on the perception 
of prosodic information, trained phoneticians labeled 
the same sentences with an integer between zero and 
five inclusive between every two words. These num- 
bers, 'prosodic break indices,' encode the degree of 
prosodic decoupling of neighboring words, the larger 
the number, the more of a gap or break between the 
words. We found that we could label such break in- 
dices with good agreement within and across labelers. 
In addition, we found that these indices quite often 
disambiguated the sentence pairs, as illustrated be- 
low. 
* Marge 0 would 1 never 2 deal 0 in 2 any 0 guys 
? Marge 1 would 0 never 0 deal 3 in 0 any 0 guise 
The break indices between 'deal' and 'in' provide 
a clear indication in this case whether the verb is 
'deal-in' or just 'deal.' The larger of the two indices, 
3, indicates that in that sentence, 'in' is not tightly 
coupled with 'deal' and hence is not likely to be a 
particle. 
So far we had established that naive listeners and 
trained listeners appear to be able to separate such 
ambiguous entence pairs on the basis of prosodic in- 
formation. If we could extract such information au- 
tomatically perhaps we could make it available to a 
parser. We found a clue in an effort to assess the 
phonetic ambiguity of the sentence pairs. We used 
SRI's DECIPHER speech recognition system, con- 
strained to recognize the correct string of words, to 
automatically abel and time-align the sentences used 
in the earlier referenced study. The DECIPHER sys- 
tem is particularly well suited to this task because 
it can model and use very bushy pronunciation et- 
works, accounting for much more detail in pronun- 
ciation than other systems. This extra detail makes 
it better able to time-align the sentences and is a 
stricter test of phonetic ambiguity. We used the DE- 
CIPHER system (Weintraub et al 1989) to label 
and time-align the speech, and verified that the sen- 
tences were, by this measure as well as by the ear- 
lier perceptual verification, truly ambiguous phonet- 
ically. This meant that the information separating 
the member of the pairs was not in the segmental 
information, but in the suprasegmental information: 
duration, pitch and pausing. As a byproduct of the 
labeling and time alignment, we noticed that the du- 
rations of the phones could be used to separate mem- 
bers of the pairs. This was easy to see in phonetically 
ambiguous entence pairs: normally the structure of 
duration patterns is obscured by intrinsic duration 
of phones and the contextual effects of neighboring 
phones. In the phonetically ambiguous pairs, there 
was no need to account for these effects in order to 
see the striking pattern in duration differences. If a 
human looking at the duration patterns could reliably 
separate the members of the pairs, there was hope for 
creating an algorithm to perform the task automat- 
ically. This task could not take advantage of such 
pairs, but would have to face the problem of intrinsic 
phone duration. 
Word break indices were generated automatically 
by normalizing phone duration according to esti- 
mated mean and variance, and combining the average 
normalized uration factors of the final syllable coda 
consonants with a pause factor. Let di = (d i -  ~j)/o'j 
be the normalized uration of the ith phoneme in the 
coda, where pj and ~rj are the mean and standard 
deviation of duration for phone j. dp is the duration 
(in ms) of the pause following the word, if any. A set 
of word break indices are computed for all the words 
in a sentence as follows: 
1 n = + d,,/70 
The term dp/70 was actually hard-limited at 4, so 
as not to give pauses too much weight. The set .A 
includes all coda consonants, but not the vowel nu- 
cleus unless the syllable ends in a vowel. Although 
the vowel nucleus provides ome boundary cues, the 
lengthening associated with prominence can be con- 
founded with boundary lengthening and the algo- 
rithm was slightly more reliable without using vowel 
nucleus information. These indices n are normalized 
over the sentence, assuming known sentence bound- 
aries, to range from zero to five (the scale used for 
the initial perceptual labeling). The correlation co- 
efficient between the hand-labeled break indices and 
the automatically generated break indices was very 
good: 0.85. 
3 Incorporat ing  Prosody  In to  
A Grammar  
Thus far, we have shown that naive and trained lis- 
teners can rely on suprasegmental information to sep- 
arate ambiguous entences, and we have shown that 
we can automatically extract information that corre- 
lates well with the perceptual labels. It remains to be 
shown how such information can be used by a parser. 
In order to do so we modified an already existing, 
and in fact reasonably large grammar. The parser we 
18 
use is the Core Language Engine developed at SRI in 
Cambridge (Alshawi et al 1988). 
Much of the modification of the grammar is done 
automatically. The first thing is to systematically 
change all the rules of the form A --* B C to be of 
the form A --. B Link C, where Link is a new gram- 
matical category, that of the prosodic break indices. 
Similarly all rules with more than two right hand side 
elements need to have link nodes interleaved at ev- 
ery juncture: e.g., a rule A --* B C D is changed into 
A --~ B Link1 C Link2 D. 
Next, allowance must be made for empty nodes. It 
is common practice to have rules of the form NP --* 
and PP ~ ~ in order to handle wh-movement and 
relative clauses. These rules necessitate the incorpo- 
ration into the modified grammar of a rule Link --* e. 
Otherwise, a sentence such as a wh-question will not 
parse because an empty node introduced by the gram- 
mar will either not be preceded by a link, or not be 
followed by one. 
The introduction of empty links needs to be con- 
strained so as not to introduce spurious parses. If  the 
only place the empty NP or PP etc. could fit into the 
sentence is at the end, then the only place the empty 
Link can go is right before it so there is no extra am- 
biguity introduced. However if an empty wh-phrase 
could be posited at a place somewhere other than the 
end of the sentence, then there is ambiguity as to 
whether it is preceded or followed by the empty link. 
For instance, for the sentence, "What did you see 
_ on Saturday?" the parser would find both of the 
following possibilities: 
? What L did L you L see L empty-NP empty-L 
on L Saturday? 
? What L did L you L see empty-L empty-NP L 
on L Saturday? 
Hence the grammar must be made to automatically 
rule out half of these possibilities. This can be 
done by constraining every empty link to be fol- 
lowed immediately by an empty wh-phrase, or a 
constituent containing an empty wh-phrase on its 
left branch. It is fairly straightforward to incorpo- 
rate this into the routine that automatically modi- 
fies the grammar. The rule that introduces empty 
links gives them a feature-value pair: empty_link=y. 
The rules that introduce other empty constituents are 
modified to add to the constituent the feature-value 
pair: trace_on_left_branch--y. The links zero through 
five are given the feature-value pair empty_link--n. 
The default value for trace_on_left_branch is set to 
n so that all words in the lexicon have that value. 
Rules of the form Ao -~ A1 Link1 . . .An  are modi- 
fied to insure that A0 and A1 have the same value

for the feature trace_on_left_branch. Additionally, 
if Linki has empty_link---y then Ai+x must have 
trace_on_left_branch--y. These modifications, incor- 
porated into the grammar-modifying routine, suffice 
to eliminate the spurious ambiguity. 
4 Setting Grammar Parame- 
ters 
Running the grammar through our procedure, to 
make the changes mentioned above, results in a gram- 
mar that gets the same number of parses for a sen- 
tence with links as the old grammar would have pro- 
duced for the corresponding sentence without links. 
In order to make use of the prosodic information 
we still need to make an additional important change 
to the grammar: how does the grammar use this in- 
formation? This area is a vast area of research. The 
present study shows the feasibility of one particular 
approach. In this initial endeavor, we made the most 
conservative changes imaginable after examining the 
break indices on a set of sentences. We changed the 
rule N --~ N Link PP so that the value of the link 
must be between 0 and 2 inclusive (on a scale of 0-5) 
for the rule to apply. We made essentially the same 
change to the rule for the construction verb plus par- 
ticle, VP --* V Link PP, except that the value of the 
link must, in this case, be either 0 or 1. 
19 
After setting these two parameters we parsed each 
of the sentences in our corpus of 14 sentences, and 
compared the number of parses to the number of 
parses obtained without benefit of prosodic informa- 
tion. For half of the sentences, i.e., for one member 
of each of the sentence pairs, the number of parses 
remained the same. For the other members of the 
pairs, the number of parses was reduced, in many 
cases from two parses to one. 
The actual sentences and labels are in the ap- 
pendix. The incorporation of prosody resulted in a re- 
duction of about 25% in the number of parses found, 
as shown in table 1. Parse times increase about 37%. 
In the study by Price et al, the sentences with 
more major breaks were more reliably identified by 
the listeners. This is exactly what happens when 
we put these sentences through our parser too. The 
large prosodic gap between a noun and a following 
preposition, or between a verb and a following prepo- 
sition provides exactly the type of information that 
our grammar can easily make use of to rule out some 
readings. Conversely, a small prosodic gap does not 
provide a reliable way to tell which two constituents 
combine. This coincides with Steedman's (1989) ob- 
servation that syntactic units do not tend to bridge 
major prosodic breaks. 
We can construe the large break between two 
words, for example a verb and a preposition/particle, 
as indicating that the two do not combine to form 
a new slightly larger constituent in which they are 
sisters of each other. We cannot say that no two con- 
stituents may combine when they are separated by 
a large gap, only that the two smallest possible con- 
stituents, i.e., the two words, may not combine. 
To do the converse with small gaps and larger 
phrases imply does not work. There are cases where 
there is a small gap between two phrases that are 
joined together. For example there can be a small gap 
between the subject NP of a sentence and the main 
VP, yet we do not want to say that the two words on 
either side of the juncture must form a constituent, 
e.g., the head noun and auxiliary verb. 
The fact that parse times increase is due to the way 
in which prosodic information is incorporated into the 
text. The parser does a certain amount of work for 
each word, and the effect of adding break indices to 
the sentence is essentially to double the number of 
words that the parser must process. We expect that 
this overhead will constitute a less significant percent- 
age of the parse time as the input sentences become 
more complex. We also hope to be able to reduce 
this overhead with a better understanding of the use 
of prosodic information and how it interacts with the 
parsing of spoken language. 
5 Corroborat ion From Other 
Data  
After devising our strategy, changing the grammar 
and lexicon, running our corpus through the parser, 
and tabulating our results, we looked at some new 
data that we had not considered before, to get an idea 
of how well our methods would carry over. The new 
corpus we considered is from a recording of a short ra- 
dio news broadcast. This time the break indices were 
put into the transcript by hand. There were twenty- 
two places in the text where our attachment strategy 
would apply. In eighteen of those, our strategy or a 
very slight modification of it, would work properly in 
ruling out some incorrect parses and in not preventing 
the correct parse from being found. In the remaining 
four sentences, there seem to be other factors at work 
that we hope to be able to incorporate into our sys- 
tem in the future. For instance it has been mentioned 
in other work that the length of a prosodic phrase, as 
measured by the number of words or syllables it con- 
tains, may affect the location of prosodic boundaries. 
We are encouraged by the fact that our strategy seems 
to work well in eighteen out of twenty-two cases on 
the news broadcast corpus. 
6 Conclusion 
The sample of sentences used for this study is ex- 
tremely small, and the principal test set used, the 
phonetically ambiguous sentences, is not independent 
of the set used to develop our system. We therefore 
do not want to make any exaggerated claims in inter- 
preting our results. We believe though, that we have 
found a promising and novel approach for incorporat- 
ing prosodic information into a natural anguage pro- 
cessing system. We have shown that some extremely 
common cases of syntactic ambiguity can be resolved 
with prosodic information, and that grammars can be 
modified to take advantage of prosodic information 
for improved parsing. We plan to test the algorithm 
for generating prosodic break indices on a larger set 
of sentences by more talkers. Changing from speech 
read by professional speakers to spontaneous speech 
from a variety of speakers will no doubt require mod- 
ification of our system along several dimensions. The 
next steps in this research will include: 
? Investigating further the relationship between 
prosody and syntax, including the different roles 
of phrase breaks and prominences in marking 
syntactic structure, 
20 
? Improving the prosodic labeling algorithm by 
incorporating intonation and syntactic/semantic 
information, 
? Incorporating the automatically labeled informa- 
tion in the parser of the SRI Spoken Language 
System (Moore, Pereira and Murveit 1989), 
? Modeling the break indices tatistically as a func- 
tion of syntactic structure, 
? Speeding up the parser when using the prosodic 
information; the expectation is that pruning out 
syntactic hypotheses that are incompatible with 
the prosodic pattern observed can both improve 
accuracy and speed up the parser overall.
