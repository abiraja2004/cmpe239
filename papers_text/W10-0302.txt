Abstract 
The exponential growth of the Persian blo-
gosphere and the increased number of neolog-
isms create a major challenge in NLP 
applications of Persian blogs. This paper de-
scribes a method for extracting and classifying 
newly constructed words and borrowings from 
Persian blog posts. The analysis of the occur-
rence of neologisms across five distinct topic 
categories points to a correspondence between 
the topic domain and the type of neologism 
that is most commonly encountered. The re-
sults suggest that different approaches should 
be implemented for the automatic detection 
and processing of neologisms depending on 
the domain of application.  
1 Introduction* 
Since its beginnings in 2001, the Persian blogos-
phere has undergone a dramatic growth making 
Persian one of the top ten languages of the global 
blog community in 2007 [Sifry 2007].  
One of the main challenges in the automatic 
analysis and processing of Persian language blogs 
is the accelerated emergence of neologisms in on-
line discourse. These newly created words that 
cannot be found in traditional lexicons primarily 
consist of adopted English loanwords, such as ??????

innovative constructions based on Persian word-

sian language blogs supported by a Mission-Oriented Investi-
gation and Experimentation (MOIE) program at MITRE.

In this paper, we investigate the distinct classes 
of neologisms encountered in Persian language 
blogs. Since the main goal of the project is to build 
a topic classification system for blogs, we focused 
on extracting neologisms that would have the most 
discriminatory power in distinguishing between the 
various classes.  
For the purposes of this study, we collected a 
corpus of Persian language blogs from five differ-
ent topic categories of sports, medicine, politics, 
Internet, and cinema. The neologisms are automat-
ically extracted by running the documents through 
a morphological analyzer. Since these new word 
coinages are not recognized by the analyzer, they 
are tagged as unknowns. A weight-ordered list of 
unknown words is then generated for each topic 
category, using information gain as the measure, as 
described in Section 2.3. The more significant neo-
logisms for each category are then manually identi-
fied from the generated weight-ordered lists, 
focusing on the top 200 words, and classified 
based on their linguistic characteristics. The results 
indicate that the type of neologism found in the 
blog posts in fact corresponds to the topic domain. 
Hence, for example, while English loans are highly 
prominent in technical and Internet related posts, 
new morphological constructions are more com-
mon in the domain of politics. Building on these 
results, we argue that distinct approaches are re-
quired for processing the adopted loan words and 
the morphologically constructed neologisms.

2 Extraction Process 
2.1 Blog Data 
The blog data for this study comes from Blogfa1, a 
popular Persian blog hosting site. The topic index 
provided by Blogfa itself has allowed us to rapidly 
collect large amounts of blog data coming from 
topic categories of interest, by eliminating the need 
to manually label the data.  Table 1 provides a list 
of the five topic categories used in this study, as 
well as the total number and the median size of the 
collected blogs for each. The table also includes 
the average number of words in each topic catego-
ry. The blogs were collected in February 2010, 
starting with the most recent blog posted in each 
topic and moving back chronologically.

2.2 Linguistic Parsing 
The collected documents are run through a Persian 
morphological parser that analyzes all word forms 
including compounds and provides a part of speech 
tag for the valid analyses [Amtrup 2003]. The 
morphological analyzer was developed for use in a 
Persian-English machine translation system and 
provides part of speech as well as all syntactically 
relevant inflectional features for a word [cf. Me-
gerdoomian 2000]. The morphological formalism 
consists of a declarative description of rules utiliz-
ing typed feature structures with unification. The 
morphological analysis component takes advantage 
of a lexicon of about 40,000 entries in citation 
form that had been developed in the period of 
1999-2002 for coverage of online news articles and 
includes nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and 
                                                          
1 www.blogfa.com 
closed class items. In addition, there are about 
5,000 common proper noun entities listed in the 
lexicon. After morphological analysis, dictionary 
lookup eliminates all erroneous analyses.  Any 
element that is not successfully associated with a 
word in the lexicon is tagged as an unknown.  
The current morphological analyzer has a cover-
age of 97% and an accuracy of 93% on a 7MB 
corpus collected from online news sources. The 
system fails to analyze conversational forms. Other 
unanalyzed tokens are mainly proper nouns and 
words missing in the lexicon.   
2.3 Information Gain 
To automatically detect the most pertinent un-
known terms per blog category, we employ an in-
formation gain (IG) based feature selection 
DSSURDFK ,*?V HIIHFWLYHQHVV DV D IHDWXUH VHOHFWLRQ 
measure for text topic categorization, the ultimate 
objective of this project, has been well studied 
[Yang and Pedersen 1997]. 
Information gain is a statistical measure for cal-
culating the expected reduction in entropy [Mit-
chell 1997]. Entropy, a common measure in 
information theory, captures the impurity of a col-
lection of examples relative to the intended classi-
fication. For a binary classification task, the 
entropy of a set of examples E is defined as: 
 
???? ??? ppppEEntropy 22 loglog)(  
 
where 
?p  is the proportion of positive examples 
and 
?p  is the proportion of negative examples in 
E. Moreover, it is assumed that 0log0 2  is equal 
to zero. The discriminatory power of an attribute 
for a given class can then be measured by IG, 
which is the reduction in entropy caused by the 
partitioning of the data using that attribute. The IG 
for example set E and attribute A is defined as: 
 
)()(),(
)(
v
AValuesv
v EEntropyE
EEEntropyAEIG ?
?
??
 
where Values(A) represents the set of all possible 
values that attribute A can take on and 
vE  is the set 
of examples for which attribute A takes on value v. 
In this study, each attribute has a binary value 
which signifies the presence or absence of a given 
unknown term in the document. So for the purpos-
7
es of this study, the above equation can be formu-
lated as: 
 
)()()(),( tttt DEntropyD
DDEntropyDDEntropytDIG ???
 
where  D is the set of all documents, t  is a given 
term, Dt is the set of documents in which term t 
occurs, and 
tD   is the set of documents in which 
term t does not occur.

Table 2 ?The top weighted unknown terms for the In-
ternet topic category and their associated  
information gain 
 
Since the aim of feature selection for this paper 
is that of identifying the most pertinent unknown 
terms for each topic category, an additional con-
straint is imposed on the feature selection process. 
Here, for a term to be selected, it not only needs to 
have a high IG, but it needs to be present in a high-
er proportion of positive examples than the nega-
tive ones. This prevents the selection of terms that 
while are good descriptors of the negative class 
and thus carry a high IG, are not necessarily perti-
nent to the positive class (i.e., the topic category 
under consideration). So IG of a term not meeting 
the above constraint is effectively set to zero.  
As indicated previously, the 200 unknown 
terms with the highest IG for each topic category 
are thus selected for the analysis portion of this 
study. Table 2 depicts a sample set of the top 
weighted terms for the Internet category in transli-
teration and translation. The transliteration schema 
was designed to display the results of the morpho-
logical analyzer system. It directly represents the 
Persian script and provides a bijective, one-to-one 
mapping of the characters. The transliteration 
omits any diacritics, including vowels, that are not 
represented in the original script. 
2.4 Candidate List 
The weight-ordered list of unknown words pro-
vides a candidate list of potential neologisms. 
However, the set of unknown terms extracted from 
each topic category includes proper names, spel-
ling errors, conversational language forms and 
neologisms. We therefore manually study the can-
didate list in order to identify the appropriate 
classes of neologisms. The results are classified 
based on the observed linguistic characteristics and 
a quantitative analysis is performed for each topic 
category. 
3 Neologism Classification 
Persian language blogs include a large number of 
neologisms ranging from new usages in conversa-
tional language to newly coined words to designate 
new technology or political concepts. We per-
formed a qualitative, linguistic investigation of 
Persian language blogs, consisting of posts from 
four main categories of technical, political, arts, 
and personal diary [Megerdoomian 2008]. The 
goal of this study was to identify elements of Per-
sian Blogspeak that indicate language change and 
which fail to be analyzed by the existing Persian 
machine translation and information extraction 
systems that had been developed for online news 
sources. The study pointed to four main categories 
of new word formation found in Persian language 
blogs: 
 
? Borrowings (mainly from English and 
French) 
? Compounding 
? Affixation 
? Conversion: Semantic and functional shift 
 
These neologisms were identified based on the 
prevalent linguistic classification of newly formed 
words (see for instance the classification of neo-
logisms described in [Grzega and Schoener 2007]). 
8
These four classes of neologisms are described in 
more detail in the rest of this section. 
3.1 Borrowings 
A large number of new loan words can be found in 
blogs. Although they may sometimes be inserted 
within the text in the original language, they are 
generally transcribed into Persian script. These 
loans are used as regular words and can take Per-
sian inflectional affixes. Some examples are pro-
vided in Table 3.

????????? seksu?liteh Sexuality 
???????? nost?lji Nostalgy 
Table 3 ? Loan words in Persian blogs 
 
 An analysis of the occurrence of loans with re-
spect to the various topic domains shows that the 
Internet category contains a large number of Eng-
lish language loans, whereas the more established 
scientific domain of medicine tends to use French 
borrowings. Also within the same category, new 
technological or scientific additions are generally 
expressed in English. For instance, in the cinema 
category, most technical words are of French ori-
gin ? e.g., ????? from ?cran ?VFUHHQ? RU ?????? from 
titrage ?RSHQLQJ FUHGLWV? However, new loans have 
entered the field from English, e.g., ??????? animey-
shen ?DQLPDWLRQ? 
3.2 Compounding 
Compounding is a productive word-formation 
process in Persian and refers to cases where two or 
more roots are combined to form a new word. Ex-
amples of compounding include   ?????? r?hk?r 
(consisting of r?h ?SDWK? DQG k?r ?ZRUN? DQG now 
EHLQJ XVHG WR PHDQ ?JXLGHOLQH? RU ?VROXWLRQ?); 
????? sarbarg (from sar ?KHDG? DQG barg ?OHDI 
SLHFH RI SDSHU? VLJQLI\LQJ ?OHWWHUKHDG?; and ?????? 
degarb?sh (formed with degar ?RWKHU? DQG b?sh
?EHLQJ? PHDQLQJ ?TXHHU?. In many cases, howev-
er, one of the roots is a borrowing that is combined 
with a Persian root form. Examples of this multi-
lingual compounding construction include ???????? 
t?bus?zi (taboo + to make) ?PDNLQJ WDERR? DQG 
???????? linkduni OLQN  VWRUDJH PHDQLQJ ?EOo-
JUROO?. 
Recently, there has been a concerted effort by 
the Persian Language Academy to replace borrow-
ings from foreign languages by equivalent Persian 
constructions. Thus, the traditional ???????? helikop-
ter ?KHOLFRSWHU? KDV EHHQ UHSODFHG E\ ?????? b?lgard  
by combining Persian b?l ?ZLQJ? DQG gard ?WXUQ? 
Similarly, the French loanword ?????? sen?ryo 
?VFUHHQSOD\? LV QRZ EHLQJ UHSODFHG E\ ???????? 
filmn?m? composed of film and n?m? ?OHWWHU 
ERRN? 
Persian has a very productive compounding 
strategy for forming new verbs where a nominal or 
adjectival root is combined with a light verb, i.e., a 
verb that has lost some of its semantic value. Many 
new verbs, especially in the technical domain, are 
formed following this construction as illustrated in 
Table 4.

?? ???? chat kardan to chat 
??  ??? ?? ??  es-em-es zadan to send a text 
message 
???? ??? kansel shodan to be cancelled 
Table 4 ? Compound verb formation 
3.3 Affixation 
New words are often created following a produc-
tive word-formation pattern using suffixes. For 
instance, the agentive suffix ?gar is used to form 
?????? morurgar ?EURZVHU? by combining with 
morur ?UHYLHZ? and  ?? ????  fetne-gar ?VHGLWLRXV? 
when combined with fetne ?VHGLWLRQ?2. Another 
common affix used to form new words is ?est?n 
which indicates a place. This suffix can be found in 
terms like ????????? vebl?gest?n (weblog + -stan) 
?EORJRVSKHUH? RU ???????? linkest?n (link + -stan) 
?EORJUROO?. 
In addition to the compound verb formation, 
bloggers have started creating simple verbs by 
combining the verbal ending ?idan with nominal 
                                                          
2 Fetne-gar is a relatively new creation that is used alongside 
the traditional fetne-ju ?VHGLWLRXV? 7KHUH LV D FOHDU VHQVH 
among native speakers, however, that fetne-gar refers to a 
person who is more agentive, actively causing discord.

3.4 Conversion 
Another type of neologism found in Persian lan-
guage blogs consists of existing words that are be-
ing used in a new context, bringing about a 
semantic shift. In certain instances, the part-of-
speech category may also shift. One example is the 
adjective ???? shaf?f ?WUDQVSaUHQW? WKDW LV Eeing 
used more and more frequently as an adverb in 
political contexts with the meanLQJ ?RSHQO\ WUDQs-
SDUHQWO\? 
This category, however, is difficult to detect au-
tomatically with the methodology used since these 
words already exist in traditional lexicons and are 
not tagged as unknowns by the morphological 
parser. Identifying conversions and semantic shifts 
currently requires a manual exploration of the data; 
we leave a study of this class of neologisms for 
future work.  
4 Topic and Neologism Correspondence 
An investigation of the neologisms for each topic 
category clearly suggests that there is a close rela-
tionship between the class of neologisms and the 
topic domain.  
Starting from the weight-ordered candidate list 
for each topic category, we manually examined 
and labeled each unknown word according to the 
neologism classification described in Section 3. In 
order to identify the correct class, each unknown 
word was considered within its context of occur-
rence in the corresponding blog posts and classi-
fied according to the usage within the sentence. In 
addition, proper names, conversational forms of 
existing words, and spelling errors were tagged 
separately.  
10
Figure 1 illustrates the correspondence of the 
number of borrowings per topic category in the 
corresponding candidate list. The results show that 
the most common way of forming new words with-
in blogs dealing with Internet and computer tech-
nology is to use borrowings from English. In the 
medical domain, however, most neologisms are 
scientific terms borrowed mainly from the French 
language. The domain of cinema and theatre also 
includes a large number of loans from French. 
However, most of the French loans across topics 
seem to be older borrowings while the newer loans 
(i.e, within the last three to five years) are almost 
always from the English language. A statistical 
analysis of the results indicate that these corres-
pondences are significant as shown in Figure 2 for 
English loans and in Figure 3 for French loans. 
Figure 2 illustrates a pairwise comparison between 
the Internet category and other blog topics based 
on the average percentage of documents in which a 
given term from the English loan neologism cate-
gory is included. (*) indicates a statistically signif-
icant difference between the two percentages. 
Figure 3 shows a similar result for the pairwise 
comparison between the Medical category and oth-
er topics for the French loan class.

Figure 3 ? Pairwise comparison for Medical blogs and other topics for French loans

Figure 4 shows the relative usage of affixation 
and compounding strategies for the creation of new 
words. Although affixation is used to some degree 
in both the Internet and medical domains, they do 
not occur as often as the English or French loans 
(cf. Figure 1 above). Interestingly, the blogs that 
fall within the political topic category do not make 
much use of borrowings from English and French. 
Instead, they tend to create new words by applying 
productive affixation and compounding strategies. 
In most instances, the words used to form neolog-
isms in the politics category are based on words of 
Arabic and Persian origin. Figure 5 illustrates the 
pairwise comparison between the Political and oth-
er blog topics based on the average percentage of 
documents in which a given term from the affixa-
tion and compounding class of neologisms is in-
cluded. (*) indicates a statistically significant 
difference between the two percentages.  
Hence, while the Internet blogs make heavy use 
of English loans in the creation of new words, po-
litical blogs tend to use affixation and compound 
strategies for word-formation. These results sug-

gest that, depending on the domain of interest for 
the particular NLP application, distinct methodolo-
gies for the automatic detection and processing of 
neologisms should be implemented.  
5 Conclusion 
This paper presents an investigation of neolog-
isms in Persian blog posts across five distinct topic 
areas. We employ morphological analysis in con-
junction with a profile-based classification tech-
nique to successfully extract a pertinent candidate 
list for identifying new word-level constructions in 
blogs. These neologisms are then classified based 
on their linguistic characteristics and word-
formation strategies and the quantitative analysis 
points to a significant correspondence between 
neologism classes and blog topic domains.  
Based on these results, we propose that the de-
tection and processing strategies should be tailored 
to the domain of the NLP application for greater 
efficiency. In particular, a derivational morpholog-
ical system can be developed by implementing the 
productive affixation and compounding rules used 
in Persian word formation. This system can be 
used to extend the existing analysis and translation 
systems in the domain of politics. Loans from Eng-
lish, on the other hand, can be automatically 
processed by using previously implemented me-
thodologies for transcribing Persian script into the 
English writing system [Megerdoomian 2006, Jo-
hanson 2007]. Such a system would be beneficial 
in recognizing the large number of loans encoun-
tered in the technical and scientific domains. 
This work is part of a larger project for automat-
ic topic classification and sentiment analysis in 
Persian language blogs. We extract the most perti-
nent neologisms encountered in the blog corpus in 
order to enhance the topic classification system. In 
addition, the results obtained will be used to extend 
the current morphological parser to improve cover-
age and identification of newly formed words.
