Abstract
Question answering systems have been de-
veloped for many languages, but most re-
sources were created for English, which
can be a problem when developing a sys-
tem in another language such as French.
In particular, for question classification,
no labeled question corpus is available for
French, so this paper studies the possi-
bility to use existing English corpora and
transfer a classification by translating the
question and their labels. By translating
the training corpus, we obtain results close
to a monolingual setting.
1 Introduction
In question answering (QA), as in most Natural
Language Processing domains, English is the best
resourced language, in terms of corpora, lexicons,
or systems. Many methods are based on super-
vised machine learning which is made possible by
the great amount of resources for this language.
While developing a question answering system
for French, we were thus limited by the lack of
resources for this language. Some were created,
for example for answer validation (Grappy et al,
2011). Yet, for question classification, although
question corpora in French exist, only a small part
of them is annotated with question classes, and
such an annotation is costly. We thus wondered
if it was possible to use existing English corpora,
in this case the data used in (Li and Roth, 2002),
to create a classification module for French.
Transfering knowledge from one language to
another is usually done by exploiting parallel cor-
pora; yet in this case, few such corpora exists
(CLEF QA datasets could be used, but question
classes are not very precise). We thus investigated
the possibility of using machine translation to cre-
ate a parallel corpus, as has been done for spoken
language understanding (Jabaian et al, 2011) for
example. The idea is that using machine transla-
tion would enable us to have a large training cor-
pus, either by using the English one and translat-
ing the test corpus, or by translating the training
corpus. One of the questions posed was whether
the quality of present machine translation systems
would enable to learn the classification properly.
This paper presents a question classification
transfer method, which results are close to those
of a monolingual system. The contributions of the
paper are the following:
? comparison of train-on-target and test-on-
source strategies for question classification;
? creation of an effective question classification
system for French, with minimal annotation
effort.
This paper is organized as follows: The problem
of Question Classification is defined in section 2.
The proposed methods are presented in section 3,
and the experiments in section 4. Section 5 details
the related works in Question Answering. Finally,
Section 6 concludes with a summary and a few
directions for future work.
2 Problem definition
A Question Answering (QA) system aims at re-
turning a precise answer to a natural language
question: if asked ?How large is the Lincoln
Memorial??, a QA system should return the an-
swer ?164 acres? as well as a justifying snippet.
Most systems include a question classification step
which determines the expected answer type, for
example area in the previous case. This type can
then be used to extract the correct answer in docu-
ments.
Detecting the answer type is usually consid-
ered as a multiclass classification problem, with
each answer type representing a class. (Zhang and

Lee, 2003) showed that a training corpus of sev-
eral thousands of questions was required to obtain
around 90% correct classification, which makes it
a costly process to adapt a system to another lan-
guage than English. In this paper, we wish to learn
such a system for French, without having to man-
ually annotate thousands of questions.
3 Transfering question classification
The two methods tested for transfering the classi-
fication, following (Jabaian et al, 2011), are pre-
sented in Figure 1:
? The first one (on the left), called test-on-
source, consists in learning a classification
model in English, and to translate the test cor-
pus from French to English, in order to apply
the English model on the translated test cor-
pus.
? The second one (on the right), called train-
on-target, consists in translating the training
corpus from English to French. We obtain an
labeled French corpus, on which it is possible
to learn a classification model.
In the first case, classification is learned on well
written questions; yet, as the test corpus is trans-
lated, translation errors may disturb the classifier.
In the second case, the classification model will
be learned on less well written questions, but the
corpus may be large enough to compensate for the
loss in quality.

posed by (Li and Roth, 2002)
4 Experiments
4.1 Question classes
We used the question taxonomy proposed by (Li
and Roth, 2002), which enabled us to compare
our results to those obtained by (Zhang and Lee,
2003) on English. This taxonomy contains two
levels: the first one contains 50 fine grained cat-
egories, the second one contains 6 coarse grained
categories. Figure 2 presents a few of these cate-
gories.
4.2 Corpora
For English, we used the data from (Li and Roth,
2002), which was assembled from USC, UIUC
and TREC collections, and has been manually la-
beled according to their taxonomy. The training
set contains 5,500 labeled questions, and the test-
ing set contains 500 questions.
For French, we gathered questions from several
evaluation campaigns: QA@CLEF 2005, 2006,
2007, EQueR and Qu?ro 2008, 2009 and 2010.
After elimination of duplicated questions, we ob-
tained a corpus of 1,421 questions, which were di-
vided into a training set of 728 questions, and a test
set of 693 questions 1. Some of these questions
were already labeled, and we manually annotated
the rest of them.
Translation was performed by Google Trans-
late online interface, which had satisfactory per-
formance on interrogative forms, which are not
well handled by all machine translation systems 2.
1This distribution is due to further constraints on the sys-
tem.
2We tested other translation systems, but Google Trans-
late gave the best results.

4.3 Classification parameters
The classifier used was LibSVM (Chang and Lin,
2011) with default parameters, which offers one-
vs-one multiclass classification, and which (Zhang
and Lee, 2003) showed to be most effective for this
task.
We only considered surface features, and ex-
tracted bag-of-ngrams (with n = 1..2).
4.4 Results and discussion
Table 1 shows the results obtained with the basic
configuration, for both transfer methods.
Results are given in precision, i.e. the propor-
tion of correctly classified questions among the
test questions 3.
Using word n-grams, monolingual English clas-
sification obtains .798 correct classification for the
fine grained classes, and .90 for the coarse grained
classes, results which are very close to those ob-
tained by (Zhang and Lee, 2003).
On French, we obtain lower results: .769 for
fine grained classes, and .84 for coarse grained
classes, probably mostly due to the smallest size
of the training corpus: (Zhang and Lee, 2003) had
a precision of .65 for the fine grained classification
with a 1,000 questions training corpus.
When translating test questions from French
to English, classification precision decreases, as
was expected from (Cumbreras et al, 2006). Yet,
when translating the training corpus from English
to French and learning the classification model
3We measured the significance of precision differences
(Student t test, p=.05), for each level of the hierarchy between
each test, and, unless indicated otherwise, comparable results
are significantly different in each condition.

Table 2: Question classification precision for both
levels of the hierarchy (features = word n-grams
with abbreviations, classifier = libsvm)
on this translated corpus, precision is close to
the French monolingual one for coarse grained
classes and a little higher than monolingual for
fine grained classification (and close to the English
monolingual one): this method gives precisions of
.794 for fine grained classes and .828 for coarse
grained classes.
One possible explanation is that the condition
when test questions are translated is very sensitive
to translation errors: if one of the test questions
is not correcly translated, the classifier will have
a hard time categorizing it. If the training cor-
pus is translated, translation errors can be counter-
balanced by correct translations. In the following
results, we do not consider the ?en to en (trans)?
method since it systematically gives lower results.
As results were lower than our existing rule-
based method, we added parts-of-speech as fea-
tures in order to try to improve them, as well as
semantic classes: the classes are lists of words re-
lated to a particular category; for example ?pres-
ident? usually means that a person is expected as
an answer. Table 2 shows the classification perfor-
mance with this additional information.
Classification is slightly improved, but only for
coarse grained classes (the difference is not signif-
icant for fine grained classes).
When analyzing the results, we noted that most
confusion errors were due to the type of features
given as inputs: for example, to correctly clas-
sify the question ?What is BPH?? as a question
expecting an expression corresponding to an ab-
breviation (ABBR:exp class in the hierarchy), it
is necessary to know that ?BPH? is an abbrevia-
tion. We thus added a specific feature to detect if
a question word is an abbreviation, simply by test-

ing if it contains only upper case letters, and nor-
malizing them. Table 3 gives the results with this
additional feature (we only kept the method with
translation of the training corpus since results were
much higher).
Precision is improved for both levels of the hi-
erarchy: for fine grained classes, results increase
from .794 to .837, and for coarse grained classes,
from .828 to .869. Remaining classification errors
are much more disparate.
5 Related work
Most question answering systems include ques-
tion classification, which is generally based on su-
pervised learning. (Li and Roth, 2002) trained
the SNoW hierarchical classifier for question clas-
sification, with a 50 classes fine grained hierar-
chy, and a coarse grained one of 6 classes. The
features used are words, parts-of-speech, chunks,
named entities, chunk heads and words related to
a class. They obtain 98.8% correct classification
of the coarse grained classes, and 95% on the fine
grained one. This hierarchy was widely used by
other QA systems.
(Zhang and Lee, 2003) studied the classifica-
tion performance according to the classifier and
training dataser size, as well as the contribution of
question parse trees. Their results are 87% correct
classification on coarse grained classes and 80%
on fine grained classes with vectorial attributes,
and 90% correct classification on coarse grained
classes and 80% on fine grained classes with struc-
tured input and tree kerneks.
These question classifications were used for
English only. Adapting the methods to other
languages requires to annotated large corpora of
questions.
In order to classify questions in different lan-
guages, (Solorio et al, 2004) proposed an in-
ternet based approach to determine the expected
type. By combining this information with ques-
tion words, they obtain 84% correct classification
for English, 84% for Spanish and 89% for Ital-
ian, with a cross validation on a 450 question cor-
pus for 7 question classes. One of the limitations
raised by the authors is the lack of large labeled
corpora for all languages.
A possibility to overcome this lack of resources
is to use existing English resources. (Cumbreras
et al, 2006) developed a QA system for Spanish,
based on an English QA system, by translating the
questions from Spanish to English. They obtain a
65% precision for Spanish question classification,
while English classification are correctly classified
with an 80% precision. This method thus leads to
an important drop in performance.
Crosslingual QA systems, in which the question
is in a different language than the documents, also
usually rely on English systems, and translate an-
swers for example (Bos and Nissim, 2006; Bow-
den et al, 2008).
6 Conclusion
This paper presents a comparison between two
transfer modes to adapt question classification
from English to French. Results show that trans-
lating the training corpus gives better results than
translating the test corpus.
Part-of-speech information only was used, but
since (Zhang and Lee, 2003) showed that best re-
sults are obtained with parse trees and tree kernels,
it could be interesting to test this additional in-
formation; yet, parsing translated questions may
prove unreliable.
Finally, as interrogative forms occur rarely is
corpora, their translation is usually of a slightly
lower quality. A possible future direction for this
work could be to use a specific model of transla-
tion for questions in order to learn question classi-
fication on higher quality translations.
