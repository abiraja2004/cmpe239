1 Introduction
This paper describes our approach to the CoNLL-
2005 shared task: semantic role labelling. We do
many of the obvious things that can be found in the
other submissions as well. We use syntactic trees
for deriving instances, partly at the constituent level
and partly at the word level. On both levels we edit
the data down to only the predicted positive cases
of verb-constituent or verb-word pairs exhibiting a
verb-argument relation, and we train two next-level
classifiers that assign the appropriate labels to the
positively classified cases. Each classifier is trained
on data in which the features have been selected to
optimize generalization performance on the particu-
lar task. We apply different machine learning algo-
rithms and combine their predictions.
As a novel addition, we designed an automatically
trained post-processing module that attempts to cor-
rect some of the errors made by the base system.
To this purpose we borrowed Levenshtein-distance-
based correction, a method from spelling error cor-
rection to repair mistakes in sequences of labels. We
adapted the method to our needs and applied it for
improving semantic role labelling output. This pa-
per presents the results of our approach.
2 Data and features
The CoNLL-2005 shared task data sets provide sen-
tences in which predicate?argument relations have
been annotated, as well as a number of extra anno-
tations like named entities and full syntactic parses
(Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005). We have used the
parses for generating machine learning instances for
pairs of predicates and syntactic phrases. In princi-
ple each phrase can have a relation with each verb
in the same sentence. However, in order to keep
the number of instances at a reasonable number, we
have only built instances for verb?phrase pairs when
the phrase parent is an ancestor of the verb (400,128
training instances). A reasonable number of ar-
guments are individual words; these do not match
with phrase boundaries. In order to be able to label
these, we have also generated instances for all pairs
of verbs and individual words using the same con-
straint (another 542,217 instances). The parent node
constraint makes certain that embedded arguments,
which do not occur in these data sets, cannot be pre-
dicted by our approach.
Instances which are associated with verb?
argument pairs receive the label of the argument as
class while others in principle receive a NULL class.
In an estimated 10% of the cases, the phrase bound-
aries assigned by the parser are different from those
in the argument annotation. In case of a mismatch,
we have always used the argument label of the first
word of a phrase as the class of the corresponding
instance. By doing this we attempt to keep the posi-
tional information of the lost argument in the train-
ing data. Both the parser phrase boundary errors as
well as the parent node constraint restrict the num-
ber of phrases we can identify. The maximum recall
score attainable with our phrases is 84.64% for the
development data set.
We have experimentally evaluated 30 features
based on the previous work in semantic role la-
belling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al,
2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004):
? Lexical features (5): predicate (verb), first
phrase word, last phrase word and words im-
mediately before and after the phrase.
? Syntactic features (14): part-of-speech tags
(POS) of: first phrase word, last phrase word,
229
word immediately before phrase and word im-
mediately after phrase; syntactic paths from
word to verb: all paths, only paths for words
before verb and only paths for words after verb;
phrase label, label of phrase parent, subcate-
gorisation of verb parent, predicate frame from
PropBank, voice, head preposition for preposi-
tional phrases and same parents flag.
? Semantic features (2): named entity tag for
first phrase word and last phrase word.
? Positional features (3): position of the phrase
with respect to the verb: left/right, distance in
words and distance in parent nodes.
? Combination features (6): predicate + phrase
label, predicate + first phrase word, predicate
+ last phrase word, predicate + first phrase
POS, predicate + last phrase POS and voice +
left/right.
The output of two parsers was available. We have
briefly experimented with the Collins parses includ-
ing the available punctuation corrections but found
that our approach reached a better performance with
the Charniak parses. We report only on the results
obtained with the Charniak parses.
3 Approach
This section gives a brief overview of the three main
components of our approach: machine learning, au-
tomatic feature selection and post-processing by a
novel procedure designed to clean up the classifier
output by correcting obvious misclassifications.
3.1 Machine learning
The core machine learning technique employed, is
memory-based learning, a supervised inductive al-
gorithm for learning classification tasks based on the
k-nn algorithm. We use the TiMBL system (Daele-
mans et al, 2003), version 5.0.0, patch-2 with uni-
form feature weighting and random tiebreaking (op-
tions: -w 0 -R 911). We have also evaluated two al-
ternative learning techniques. First, Maximum En-
tropy Models, for which we employed Zhang Le?s
Maximum Entropy Toolkit, version 20041229 with
default parameters. Second, Support Vector Ma-
chines for which we used Taku Kudo?s YamCha
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003), with one-versus-all
voting and option -V which enabled us to ignore pre-
dicted classes with negative distances.
3.2 Feature selection
In previous research, we have found that memory-
based learning is rather sensitive to the chosen fea-
tures. In particular, irrelevant or redundant fea-
tures may lead to reduced performance. In order
to minimise the effects of this sensitivity, we have
employed bi-directional hill-climbing (Caruana and
Freitag, 1994) for finding the features that were most
suited for this task. This process starts with an empty
feature set, examines the effect of adding or remov-
ing one feature and then starts a new iteration with
the set associated with the best performance.
3.3 Automatic post-processing
Certain misclassifications by the semantic role-
labelling system described so far lead to unlikely and
impossible relation assignments, such as assigning
two indirect objects to a verb where only one is pos-
sible. Our proposed classifier has no mechanism to
detect these errors. One solution is to devise a post-
processing step that transforms the resulting role as-
signments until they meet certain basic constraints,
such as the rule that each verb may have only sin-
gle instances of the different roles assigned in one
sentence (Van den Bosch et al, 2004).
We propose an alternative automatically-trained
post-processing method which corrects unlikely role
assignments either by deleting them or by replacing
them with a more likely one. We do not do this by
knowledge-based constraint satisfaction, but rather
by adopting a method for error correction based on
Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1965), or edit
distance, as used commonly in spelling error correc-
tion. Levenshtein distance is a dynamically com-
puted distance between two strings, accounting for
the number of deletions, insertions, and substitu-
tions needed to transform the one string into the
other. Levenshtein-based error correction typically
matches a new, possibly incorrect, string to a trusted
lexicon of assumedly correct strings, finds the lex-
icon string with the smallest Levenshtein distance
to the new string, and replaces the new string with
the lexicon string as its likely correction. We imple-
mented a roughly similar procedure. First, we gener-
ated a lexicon of semantic role labelling patterns of
A0?A5 arguments of verbs on the basis of the entire
training corpus and the PropBank verb frames. This
230
lexicon contains entries such as abandon A0 V A1,
and categorize A1 V A2 ? a total of 43,033 variable-
length role labelling patterns.
Next, given a new test sentence, we consider all
of its verbs and their respective predicted role la-
bellings, and compare each with the lexicon, search-
ing the role labelling pattern with the same verb at
the smallest Levenshtein distance (in case of an un-
known verb we search in the entire lexicon). For
example, in a test sentence the pattern emphasize A0
V A1 A0 is predicted. One closest lexicon item is
found at Levenshtein distance 1, namely emphasize
A0 V A1, representing a deletion of the final A0. We
then use the nearest-neighbour pattern in the lexicon
to correct the likely error, and apply all deletions
and substitutions needed to correct the current pat-
tern according to the nearest-neighbour pattern from
the trusted lexicon. We do not apply insertions, since
the post-processor module does not have the infor-
mation to decide which constituent or word would
receive the inserted label. In case of multiple possi-
ble deletions (e.g. in deleting one out of two A1s in
emphasize A0 V A1 A1), we always delete the argu-
ment furthest from the verb.
4 Results
In order to perform the optimisation of the seman-
tic role labelling process in a reasonable amount of
time, we have divided it in four separate tasks: prun-
ing the data for individual words and the data for
phrases, and labelling of these two data sets. Prun-
ing amounts to deciding which instances correspond
with verb-argument pairs and which do not. This
resulted in a considerable reduction of the two data
sets: 47% for the phrase data and 80% for the word
data. The remaining instances are assumed to de-
fine verb-argument pairs and the labelling tasks as-
sign labels to them. We have performed a sepa-
rate feature selection process in combination with
the memory-based learner for each of the four tasks.
First we selected the best feature set based on task
accuracy. As soon as a working module for each of
the tasks was available, we performed an extra fea-
ture selection process for each of the modules, opti-
mising overall system F?=1 while keeping the other
three modules fixed.

sets when memory-based learning is applied to the
development set (overall F?=1). The process con-
sisted of four tasks: pruning data sets for individual
words and phrases, and labelling these two data sets.
Selected features are shown in bold. Unfortunately,
we have not been able to use all promising features.
mance can be found in Table 1. One feature (syntac-
tic path) was selected in all four tasks but in general
different features were required for optimal perfor-
mance in the four tasks. Changing the feature set
had the largest effect when labelling the phrase data.
We have applied the two other learners, Maximum
Entropy Models and Support Vector Machines to the
two labelling tasks, while using the same features as
the memory-based learner. The performance of the
three systems on the development data can be found
in Table 3. Since the systems performed differently
we have also evaluated the performance of a com-
bined system which always chose the majority class
assigned to an instance and the class of the strongest
system (SVM) in case of a three-way tie. The com-
bined system performed slightly better than the best

5 Conclusion
We have presented a machine learning approach to
semantic role labelling based on full parses. We
have split the process in four separate tasks: prun-
ing the data bases of word-based and phrase-based
examples down to only the positive verb-argument
cases, and labelling the two positively classified data
sets. A novel automatic post-processing procedure
based on spelling correction, comparing to a trusted
lexicon of verb-argument patterns from the training
material, was able to achieve a performance increase
by correcting unlikely role assignments.
