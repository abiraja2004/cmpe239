Abstract 
This paper presents the design and construc-
tion of an annotated Chinese collocation bank 
as the resource to support systematic research 
on Chinese collocations. With the help of 
computational tools, the bi-gram and n-gram 
collocations corresponding to 3,643 head-
words are manually identified. Furthermore, 
annotations for bi-gram collocations include 
dependency relation, chunking relation and 
classification of collocation types. Currently, 
the collocation bank annotated 23,581 bi-
gram collocations and 2,752 n-gram colloca-
tions extracted from  a 5-million-word corpus. 
Through statistical analysis on the collocation 
bank, some characteristics of Chinese bi-
gram collocations are examined which is es-
sential to collocation research, especially for 
Chinese. 
1 Introduction 
Collocation is a lexical phenomenon in which two 
or more words are habitually combined and com-
monly used in a language to express certain seman-
tic meaning. For example, in Chinese, people will 
say ??-?? (historical baggage) rather than ?
? -?? (historical luggage) even though ??
(baggage) and ?? (luggage) are synonymous. 
However, no one can argue why ?? must collo-
cate with??. Briefly speaking, collocations are 
frequently used word combinations. The collocated 
words always have syntactic or semantic relations 
but they cannot be generated directly by syntactic 
or semantic rules. Collocation can bring out differ-
ent meanings a word can carry and it plays an in-
dispensable role in expressing the most appropriate 
meaning in a given context. Consequently, colloca-
tion knowledge is widely employed in natural lan-
guage processing tasks such as word sense disam-
biguation, machine translation, information re-
trieval and natural language generation (Manning 
et al 1999).  
Although the importance of collocation is well 
known, it is difficult to compile a complete collo-
cation dictionary. There are some existing corpus 
linguistic researches on automatic extraction of 
collocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993; 
Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006). These techniques are 
mainly based on statistical techniques and syntactic 
analysis. However, the performances of automatic 
collocation extraction systems are not satisfactory 
(Pecina 2005). A problem is that collocations are 
word combinations that co-occur within a short 
context, but not all such co-occurrences are true 
collocations. Further examinations is needed to 
filter out pseudo-collocations once co-occurred 
word pairs are identified.  A collocation bank with 
true collocations annotated is naturally an indis-
pensable resource for collocation research. (Kosho 
et al 2000) presented their works of collocation 
annotation on Japanese text. Also, the Turkish 
treebank, (Bedin 2003) included collocation anno-
tation as one step in its annotation. These two col-
location banks provided collocation identification 
and co-occurrence verification information. (Tutin 
2005) used shallow analysis based on finite state 
transducers and lexicon-grammar to identify and 
annotate collocations in a French corpus. This col-
location bank further provided the lexical functions 
of the collocations. However to this day, there is 
no reported Chinese collocation bank available.

In this paper, we present the design and con-
struction of a Chinese collocation bank (acrony-
med CCB). This is the first attempt to build a 
large-scale Chinese collocation bank as a Chinese 
NLP resource with multiple linguistic information 
for each collocation including:  (1) annotating the 
collocated words for each given headword; (2) dis-
tinguishing n-gram and bi-gram collocations for 
the headword; (3) for bi-gram collocations, CCB 
provides their syntactic dependencies, chunking 
relation and classification of collocation types 
which is proposed by (Xu and Lu 2006). In addi-
tion, we introduce the quality assurance mecha-
nism used for CCB. CCB currently contains for 
3,643 common headwords taken from ?The Dic-
tionary of Modern Chinese Collocations? (Mei 
1999) with 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations and 
2,752 unique n-gram collocations extracted from a 
five-million-word segmented and chunked Chinese 
corpus (Xu and Lu, 2005). 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents some basic concepts. Section 3 
describes the annotation guideline. Section 4 de-
scribes the practical issues in the annotation proc-
ess including corpus preparation, headword prepa-
ration, annotation flow, and the quality assurance 
mechanism. Section 5 gives current status of CCB 
and characteristics analysis of the annotated collo-
cations. Section 6 concludes this paper. 
2 Basic Concepts 
Although collocations are habitual expressions in 
natural language use and they can be easily under-
stood by people, a precise definition of collocation 
is still far-reaching (Manning et al 1999). In this 
study, we define a collocation as a recurrent and 
conventional expression of two or more content 
words that holds syntactic and semantic relation. 
Content words in Chinese include noun, verb, ad-
jective, adverb, determiner, directional word, and 
gerund. Collocations with only two words are 
called bi-gram collocations and others are called n-
gram collocations. 
From a linguistic view point, collocations have a 
number of characteristics. Firstly, collocations are 
recurrent as they are of habitual use. Collocations 
occur frequently in similar contexts and they ap-
pear in certain fixed patterns. However, they can-
not be described by the same set of syntactic or 
semantic rules. Secondly, free word combinations 
which can be generated by linguistic rules are 
normally considered compositional.  In contrast, 
collocations should be limited compositional 
(Manning et al 1999) and they usually carry addi-
tional meanings when used as a collocation. 
Thirdly, collocations are also limited substitutable 
and limited modifiable. Limited substitutable here 
means that a word cannot be freely substituted by 
other words with similar linguistic functions in the 
same context such as synonyms. Also, many collo-
cations cannot be modified freely by adding modi-
fiers or through grammatical transformations. 
Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja 
1993) and language-dependent.  
3 Annotation Guideline Design 
The guideline firstly determines the annotation 
strategy. 
(1) The annotation of CCB follows the head-
word-driven strategy. The annotation uses selected 
headwords as the starting point. In each circle, the 
collocations corresponding to one headword are 
annotated. Headword-driven strategy makes a 
more efficient annotation as it is helpful to estimate 
and compare the relevant collocations. 
(2) CCB is manually annotated with the help of 
automatic estimation of computational features, i.e. 
semi-automatic software tools are used to generate 
parsing and chunking candidates and to estimate 
the classification features. These data are present to 
the annotators for determination. The use of assis-
tive tools is helpful to produce accurate annota-
tions with efficiency. 
The guideline also specifies the information to 
be annotated and the labels used in the annotation. 
For a given headword, CCB annotates both bi-
gram collocations and n-gram collocations. Con-
sidering the fact that n-gram collocations consist-
ing of continuous significant bi-grams as a whole 
and, the n-gram annotation is based on the identifi-
cation and verification of bi-gram word combina-
tions and is prior to the annotation of bi-gram col-
locations.  
For bi-gram annotation, which is the major in-
terest  in collocation research, three kinds of in-
formation are annotated. The first one is the syn-
tactic dependency of the headword and its co-word 
in a bi-gram collocation . A syntactic dependency 
normally consists of one word as the governor (or 
head), a dependency type and another word serves 
62
as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10 
types of dependencies are annotated in CCB. They 
are listed in Table 1 below. 
 
 Dependency Description Example 
ADA Adjective and its adverbial modifier ??/d ??/a  greatly painful 
ADV Predicate and its adverbial modifier in 
which the predicate serves as head 
??/ad ??/v heavily strike 
AN Noun and its adjective modifier ??/a ??/n lawful incoming 
CMP Predicate and its complement in which 
the predicate serves as head 
??/v??/v ineffectively treat
NJX Juxtaposition structure ??/a??/a fair and reasonable
NN Noun and its nominal modifier ??/n ??/n personal safety 
SBV Predicate and its subject ??/n ??/v property transfer 
VO Predicate and its object in which the 
predicate serves as head 
??/v ??/n change mechanism
VV Serial verb constructions which indi-
cates that there are serial actions  
??/v ??/v trace and report 
OT Others   
Table 1. The dependency categories 
The second one is the syntactic chunking informa-
tion (a chunk is defined as a minimum non-nesting 
or non-overlapping phrase) (Xu and Lu, 2005). 
Chunking information identifies all the words for a 
collocation within the context of an enclosed 
chunk. Thus, it is a way to identify its proper con-
text at the most immediate syntactic structure. 11 
types of syntactic chunking categories given in (Xu 
and 2006) are used as listed in Table 2.  
 
 Description Examples 
BNP Base noun phrase [??/n ??/n]NP     market economy 
BAP Base adjective phrase  [??/a??/a]BAP   fair and reasonable
BVP Base verb phrase [??/a??/v]BVP   successfully start 
BDP Base adverb phrase [?/d ??/d]BDP      no longer 
BQP Base quantifier phrase [?? /m ? /q]BQP ?? /n several thou-
sand soldiers 
BTP Base time phrase [??/t ??/t]BTP 8:00 in the morning 
BFP Base position phrase [??/ns ???/f]BFP Northeast of Mon-
golia 
BNT Name of an organization [??/ns ??/n]BNT Yantai University 
BNS Name of a place [??/ns ??/ns]BNS Tongshan, Jiangsu 
Province 
BNZ Other proper noun phrase [???/nr?/n]BNZ The Nobel Prize 
BSV S-V structure [??/n ??/a]BSV  territorial integrity 
Table 2. The chunking categories 
The third one is the classification of collocation 
types. Collocations cover a wide spectrum of ha-
bitual word combinations ranging from idioms to 
free word combinations. Some collocations are 
very rigid and some are more flexible. (Xu and Lu 
2006) proposed a scheme to classify collocations 
into four types according to the internal association 
of collocations including compositionality, non-
substitutability, non-modifiability, and statistical 
significance. They are,  
Type 0: Idiomatic Collocation 
Type 0 collocations are fully non-compositional 
as its meaning cannot be predicted from the mean-
ings of its components such as???? (climbing 
a tree to catch a fish, which is a metaphor for a 
fruitless endeavour). Some terminologies are also 
Type 0 collocations such as ?  ?(Blue-tooth ) 
which refers to a wireless communication protocol. 
Type 0 collocations must have fixed forms. Their 
components are non-substitutable and non-
modifiable allowing no syntactic transformation 
and no internal lexical variation. This type of col-
locations has very strong internal associations and 
co-occurrence statistics is not important.  
Type 1: Fixed Collocation 
Type 1 collocations are very limited composi-
tional with fixed forms which are non-substitutable 
and non-modifiable. However, this type can be 
compositional. None of the words in a Type 1 col-
location can be substituted by any other words to 
retain the same meaning such as in??/n ???
/n (diplomatic immunity). Finally, Type 1 colloca-
tions normally have strong co-occurrence statistics 
to support them. 
Type 2: Strong Collocation 
Type 2 collocations are limitedly compositional. 
They allow very limited substitutability. In other 
words, their components can only be substituted by 
few synonyms and the newly generated word com-
binations have similar meaning, e.g., ??/v ??
/n (alliance formation) and ??/v ??/n (alliance 
formation). Furthermore, Type 2 collocations al-
low limited modifier insertion and the order of 
components must be maintained. Type2 colloca-
tions normally have strong statistical support.  
Type 3: Loose Collocation 
Type 3 collocations have loose restrictions. 
They are nearly compositional. Their components 
may be substituted by some of their synonyms and 
the newly generated word combinations usually 
have very similar meanings. Type 3 collocations 
are modifiable meaning that they allow modifier 
insertions. Type 3 collocations have weak internal 
associations and they must have statistically sig-
nificant co-occurrence.  
The classification represents the strength of in-
ternal associations of collocated words. The anno-
tation of these three kinds of information is essen-
tial to all-rounded characteristic analysis of collo-
cations.

4 Annotation of CCB 
4.1 Data Preparation 
CCB is based on the PolyU chunk bank (Xu and 
Lu, 2005) which contains chunking information on 
the People?s Daily corpus with both segmentation 
and part-of-speech tags. The accuracies of word 
segmentation and POS tagging are claimed to be 
higher than 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu et 
al. 2001). The use of this popular and accurate raw 
resource helped to reduce the cost of annotation 
significantly, and ensured maximal sharing of our 
output.  
The set of 3, 643 headwords are selected from 
?The Dictionary of Modern Chinese Collocation? 
(Mei 1999) among about 6,000 headwords in the 
dictionary. The selection  was based both on the 
judgment by linguistic experts as well as the statis-
tical information that they are commonly used. 
4.2 Corpus Preprocessing 
The CCB annotations are represented in XML. 
Since collocations are practical word combinations 
and word is the basic unit in collocation research, a 
preprocessing module is devised to transfer the 
chunked sentences in the PolyU chunk bank to 
word sequences with the appropriate labels to indi-
cate the corresponding chunking information. This 
preprocessing module indexes the words and 
chunks in the sentences and encodes the chunking 
information of each word in two steps. Consider 
the following sample sentence extracted from the 
PolyU chunk bank: 
??/v[??/n??/n]BNP?/u[??/n??/n??
/an ]BNP 
(ensure life and property safety of the people) 
The first step in preprocessing is to index each 
word and the chunk in the sentence by giving in-
cremental word ids and chunk ids from left to right. 
That is,, 
[W1]??/v [W2]??/n [W3]??/n [W4]?/u  
[W5]??/n [W6]??/n [W7]??/an [C1]BNP [C2]BNP 
where, [W1] to [W7] are the words and [C1] to [C2] 
are chunks although chunking positions are not 
included in this step. One Chinese word may occur 
in a sentence for more than one times, the unique 
word ids are helpful to avoid ambiguities in the 
collocation annotation on these words. 
The second step is to represent the chunking in-
formation of each word. Chunking boundary in-
formation is labeled by following initial/final rep-
resentation scheme. Four labels, O/B/I/E, are used 
to mark the isolated words outsides any chunks, 
chunk-initial words, words in the middle of chunks, 
and chunk-final words, respectively. Finally, a la-
bel H is used to mark the identified head of chunks 
and N to mark the non-head words. 
The above sample sentence is then transferred to 
a sequence of words with labels as shown below, 
<labeled> [W1][O_O_N][O]??/v [W2][B_BNP_N][C1]
??/n [W3][E_BNP_H][C1]??/n [W4][O_O_N][O]?/u 
[W5][B_BNP_N][C2]??/n [W6][I_BNP_N][C2]??/n 
[W7][E_BNP_N][C2]??/an </labeled> 
For each word, the first label is the word ID. The 
second one is a hybrid tag for describing its chunk-
ing status. The hybrid tags are ordinal with respect 
to the chunking status of boundary, syntactic cate-
gory and head, For example, B_BNP_N indicates 
that current word is the beginning or a BNP and 
this word is not the head of this chunk. The third 
one is the chunk ID if applicable. For the word out 
of any chunks, a fixed chunk ID O is given. 
4.3 Collocation Annotation 
Collocation annotation is conducted on one head-
word at a time. For a given headword, an annota-
tors examines its context to determine if its co-
occurred word(s) forms a collocation with it and if 
so, also annotate the collocation?s dependency, 
chunking and classification information. The anno-
tation procedure, requires three passes. We use a 
headword ??/an (safe), as an illustrative exam-
ple.  
Pass 1. Concordance and dependency identifica-
tion 
In the first pass, the concordance of the given 
headword is performed. Sentences containing the 
headwords are obtained, e.g.  
S1: ??/v [??/v  ??/an]BVP  ?/u  ??/n 
(follow the principles for ensuring the safety) 
S2: ??/v [??/n ??/n]BNP ?/u[??/n ??/n ?
?/an]BNP 
(ensure life and property safety of people) 
S3: ??/v  ??/ns  [??/an  ??/v]BVP 
(ensure the flood pass through Yangzi River safely) 
With the help of an automatic dependency pars-
er, the annotator determines all syntactically and 
semantically dependent words in the chunking con-
text of the observing headword. The annotation 
output of S1 is given below in which XML tags are 
used for the dependency annotation.  
S1:<sentence>??/v [??/v  ??/an]BVP  ?/u  ??/n 
64
<labeled> [W1][O_O_N][O]??/v [W2][B_BVP_H][C1]
??/v [W3][E_BNP_N][C1]??/an [W4][O_O_N][O]?
/u  [W5][O_O_N][O]??/n </labeled> 
<dependency no="1" observing="??/an" head="??
/v" head_wordid="W2" head_chunk ="B_BVP_H" 
head_chunkid="C1" modifier=" ? ? /an" modi-
fier_wordid="W3" modifier _chunk="E_BVP_N" 
modifer_chunkid="C1" relation="VO" > </dependency> 
</sentence> 
Dependency of word combination is annotated 
with the tag <dependency> which includes the fol-
lowing attributes: 
-<dependency> indicates an identified depend-
ency   
-no is the id of identified dependency within cur-
rent sentence according to ordinal sequence 
-observing indicates the current observing 
headword 
-head indicates the head of the identified word 
dependency 
-head_wordid is the word id of the head 
-head_chunk is the hybrid tags for labeling the 
chunking information of the head 
-head_chunkid is the chunk id of the head 
-modifier indicates the modifier of the identified 
dependency 
-modifier_wordid is the word id of the modifier 
-modifier_chunk is the hybrid tags for labeling 
chunking information of the modifier 
-modifier_chunkid is the chunk id of the modi-
fier 
-relation gives the syntactic dependency rela-
tions labeled according to the dependency labels 
listed in Table 1. 
In S1 and S2, the word combination ??/v??
/an has direct dependency, and in S3, such a de-
pendency does not exist as??/v only determines
??/v and ??/an depends on ??/v. The qual-
ity of CCB highly depends on the accuracy of de-
pendency annotation. This is very important for 
effective characteristics analysis of collocations 
and for the collocation extraction algorithms.  
Pass 2. N-gram collocations annotation 
It is relatively easy to identify n-gram colloca-
tions since an n-gram collocation is of habitual and 
recurrent use of a series of bi-grams. This means 
that n-gram collocations can be identified by find-
ing consecutive occurrence of significant bi-grams 
in certain position. In the second pass, the annota-
tors focus on the sentences where the headword 
has more than one dependency. The percentage of 
all appearances of each dependent word at each 
position around the headword is estimated with the 
help of a program (Xu and Lu, 2006). Finally, 
word dependencies frequently co-occurring in con-
secutive positions in a fixed order are extracted as 
n-gram collocations.   
For the headword, an n-gram collocation??/n 
? ? /n ? ? /an is identified since the co-
occurrence percentage of dependency??/-NN-?
?/an and dependency??/n-NN-??/an is 0.74 
is greater than a empirical threshold suggest in (Xu 
and Lu, 2006). This n-gram is annotated in S2 as 
follows: 
<ncolloc observing="??/an" w1="??/n" w2="??/n" 
w3="??/an" start_wordid="5"> </ncolloc> 
where, 
-<ncolloc> indicates an n-gram collocation  
-w1, w2,..wn give the components of the n-gram 
collocation according to the ordinal sequence.  
-start_wordid  indicates the word id of the first 
component of the n-gram collocation. 
Since n-gram collocation is regarded as a whole, 
its internal dependencies are ignored in the output 
file of pass 2. That is, if the dependencies of sev-
eral components are associated with an n-gram 
collocation in one sentence, the n-gram collocation 
is annotated and these dependencies are filtered out 
so as not to disturb the bi-gram dependencies.  
Pass 3. Bi-gram collocations annotation 
In this pass, all the word dependencies are ex-
amined to identify bi-gram collocations. Further-
more, if a dependent word combination is regarded 
as a collocation by the annotators, it will be further 
labeled based on the type determined. The identifi-
cation is based on expert knowledge combined 
with the use of several computational features as 
discussed in (Xu and Lu, 2006). 
An assistive tool is developed to estimate the 
computational features. We use the program to ob-
tain feature data based on two sets of data. The 
first data set is the annotated dependencies in the 
5-million-word corpus which is obtained through 
Pass 1 and Pass 2 annotations. Because the de-
pendent word combinations are manually identi-
fied and annotated in the first pass, the statistical 
significance is helpful to identify whether the word 
combination is a collocation and to determine its 
type. However, data sparseness problem must be 
considered since 5-million-word is not large 
enough. Thus, another set of statistical data are 
65
collected from a 100-million segmented and tagged 
corpus (Xu and Lu, 2006). With this large corpus, 
data sparseness is no longer a serious problem. But, 
the collected statistics are quite noisy since they 
are directly retrieved from text without any verifi-
cation. By analyzing the statistical features from 
both sets, the annotator can use his/her professional 
judgment to determine whether a bi-gram is a col-
location and its collocation type. 
In the example sentences, two collocations are 
identified. Firstly, ??/an ??/v is classified as a 
Type 1 collocation as they have only one peak co-
occurrence, very low substitution ratio and their 
co-occurrence order nearly never altered. Secondly, 
??/v ??/an is identified as a collocation. They 
have frequent co-occurrences and they are always 
co-occurred in fixed order among the verified de-
pendencies. However, their co-occurrences are dis-
tributed evenly and they have two peak co-
occurrences. Therefore, ??/v ??/an is classi-
fied as a Type 3 collocation. These bi-gram collo-
cations are annotated as illustrated below, 
<bcolloc observing="??/an" col="??/v" head="??
/v" type= "1" relation="ADV">  
<dependency no="1" observing="??/an" head="??/v" 
head_wordid="W4" head_chunk ="E_BVP_H" 
head_chunkid="C1" modifier=" ? ? /an" modi-
fier_wordid="W3" modifier _chunk="B_BVP_N" 
modifer_chunkid="C1" relation="ADV" 
></dependency></bcolloc> 
where, 
-<bcolloc> indicates a bi-gram collocation. 
-col is for  the collocated word. 
-head indicates the head of an identified colloca-
tion 
-type is the classified collocation type. 
-relation gives the syntactic dependency rela-
tions of this bi-gram collocation. 
Note that the dependency annotations within the 
bi-gram collocations are reserved. 
4.4 Quality Assurance 
The annotators of CCB are three post-graduate stu-
dents majoring in linguistics. In the first annotation 
stage, 20% headwords of the whole set was anno-
tated in duplicates by all three of them. Their out-
puts were checked by a program. Annotated collo-
cation including classified dependencies and types 
accepted by at least two annotators are reserved in 
the final data as the Golden Standard while the 
others are considered incorrect. The inconsisten-
cies between different annotators were discussed to 
clarify any misunderstanding in order to come up 
with the most appropriate annotations. In the sec-
ond annotation stage, 80% of the whole annota-
tions were then divided into three parts and sepa-
rately distributed to the annotators with 5% dupli-
cate headwords were distributed blindly. The du-
plicate annotation data were used to estimate the 
annotation consistency between annotators.  
5 Collocation Characteristic Analysis 
5.1 Progress and Quality of CCB 
Up to now, the first version of CCB is completed. 
We have obtained 23,581 unique bi-gram colloca-
tions and 2,752 unique n-gram collocations corre-
sponding to the 3,643 observing headwords. 
Meanwhile, their occurrences in the corpus are an-
notated and verified. With the help of a computer 
program, the annotators manually classified bi-
gram collocations into three types. The numbers of 
Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 collocations are 152, 
3,982 and 19,447, respectively.  
For the 3,643 headwords in The Dictionary of 
Modern Chinese Collocations (Mei 1999) with 
35,742 bi-gram collocations,  20,035 collocations 
appear in the corpus. We call this collection as 
Mei?s Collocation Collection (MCC). There are 
19,967 common entries in MCC and CCB, which 
means 99.7% collocations in MCC appear in CCB 
indicating a good linguistic consistency. Further-
more, 3,614 additional collocations are found in 
CCB which enriches the static collocation diction-
ary.
 
5.2 Dependencies Numbers Statistics of Col-
locations 
Firstly, we study the statistics of how many types 
of dependencies a bi-gram collocation may have. 
The numbers of dependency types with respect to 
different collocation types are listed in Table 3.  
 
Collocations 1 type 2 types >2 types Total 
Type 0/1 152 0 0 152 
Type 2 3970 12 0 3982 
Type 3 17282 2130 35 19447 
Total 21404 2142 35 23581 
Table 3. Collocation classification versus number 
of dependency types 
66
It is observed that about 90% bi-gram collocations 
have only one dependency type. This indicates that 
a collocation normally has only one fixed syntactic 
dependency. It is also observed that about 10% bi-
gram collocations have more than one dependency 
type, especially Type 3 collocations. For example, 
two types of dependencies are identified in the bi-
gram collocation ??/an-??/n. They are ??
/an-AN-??/n (a safe nation) which indicates the 
dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier 
where ??/n serves as the head, and??/n-NN-
?? /an (national security) which indicates the 
dependency of a noun and its nominal modifier 
where ??/an serves as the head. It is attributed to 
the fact that the use of Chinese words is flexible. A 
Chinese word may support different part-of-speech. 
A collocation with different dependencies results 
in different distribution trends and most of these 
collocations are classified as Type 3. On the other 
hand, Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations seldom 
have more than one dependency type. 
5.3 Syntactic Dependency Statistics of Collo-
cations 
The statistics of the 10 types of syntactic depend-
encies with respect to different types of bi-gram 
collocations are shown in Table 4. No. is the num-
ber of collocations with a given dependency type  
D and a given collocation type T. The percentage 
of No. among all collocations with the same collo-
cation type T is labeled as P_T, and the percentage 
of No. among all of the collocations with the same 
dependency D is labeled as P_D.

Table 4. The statistics of collocations with dif-
ferent collocation type and dependency 
 
Corresponding to 23,581 bi-gram collocations, 
25,793 types of dependencies are identified (some 
collocations have more than one types of depend-
ency). In which, about 82% belongs to five major 
dependency types. They are AN, VO, NN, ADV and 
SBV. It is note-worthy that the percentage of NN 
collocation is much higher than that in English. 
This is because nouns are more often used in paral-
lel to serve as one syntactic component in Chinese 
sentences than in English. 
The percentages of Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 
collocations in CCB are 0.6%, 16.9% and 82.5%, 
respectively. However, the collocations with dif-
ferent types of dependencies have shown their own 
characteristics with respect to different collocation 
types. The collocations with CMP, NJX and NN 
dependencies on average have higher percentage to 
be classified into Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations. 
This indicates that CMP, NJX and NN collocations 
in Chinese are always used in fixed patterns and 
these kinds of collocations are not freely modifi-
able and substitutable. In the contrary, many ADV 
and AN collocations are classified as Type 3. This 
is partially due to the special usage of auxiliary 
words in Chinese.  Many AN Chinese collocations 
can be inserted by a meaningless auxiliary word?
/u and many ADV Chinese collocations can be in-
serted by an auxiliary word?/u. This means that 
many AN and ADV collocations can be modified 
and thus, they always have two peak co-
occurrences. Therefore, they are classified as Type 
3 collocations. 7.7% and 62.5% of the collocations 
with dependency OT are classified as Type 0/1 and 
Type2 collocations, respectively. Such percentages 
are much higher than the average. This is attributed 
by the fact that some Type 0/1 and Type 2 colloca-
tions have strong semantic relations rather than 
syntactic relations and thus their dependencies are 
difficult to label. 
5.4 Chunking Statistics of Collocations 
The chunking characteristic for the collocations 
with different types and different dependencies are 
examined. In most cases, Type 0/1/2 collocations 
co-occur within one chunk or between neighboring 
chunks. Therefore, their chunking characteristics 
are not discussed in detail. The percentage of the 
occurrences of Type 3 collocations with different 
chunking distances are given in Table 5. If a collo-
cation co-occurs within one chunk, the chunking 
distance is 0. If a collocation co-occurs between 
neighboring chunks, or between neighboring words, 
or between a word and a neighboring chunk, the 
chunking distance is 1, and so on.

>2chunks 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 1.3 5.6 2.1 0.0
Table 5. Chunking distances of Type 3 collocations  
 
It is shown that the co-occurrence of collocations 
decreases with increased chunking distance. Yet, 
the behavior for decrease is different for colloca-
tions with different dependencies. Generally speak-
ing, the ADA, ADV, CMP, NJX, NN and OT collo-
cations seldom co-occur cross two words or two 
chunks. Furthermore, the occurrences of AN, NJX 
and OT collocations quickly drops when the 
chunking distance is greater than 0, i.e. these col-
locations tends to co-occur within the same chunk. 
In the contrary, the co-occurrences of ADA, ADV, 
CMP, SBV and VV collocations corresponding to 
chunking distance equals 0 and 1 decrease steadily. 
It means that these four kinds of collocations are 
more evenly distributed within the same chunk or 
between neighboring words or chunks. The occur-
rences of VO collocations corresponding to chunk-
ing distance from 0 to 3 with a much flatter reduc-
tion. This indicates that a verb may govern its ob-
ject in a long range. 
6 Conclusions 
This paper describes the design and construction of 
a manually annotated Chinese collocation bank. 
Following a set of well-designed annotation guide-
line, the collocations corresponding to 3,643 
headwords are identified from a chunked five-
million word corpus. 2,752 unique n-gram colloca-
tions and 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations are 
annotated. Furthermore, each bi-gram collocation 
is annotated with its syntactic dependency informa-
tion, classification information and chunking in-
formation. Based on CCB, characteristics of collo-
cations with different types and different depend-
encies are examined. The obtained result is essen-
tial for improving research related to Chinese col-
location. Also, CCB may be used as a standard an-
swer set for evaluating the performance of differ-
ent collocation extraction algorithms. In the future, 
collocations of all unvisited headwords will be an-
notated to produce a complete 5-million-word Chi-
nese collocation bank.
