Abstract 
This paper presents a project that 
investigates to what extent computational 
linguistic methods and tools used at GETA 
for machine translation can be used to 
implement  novel funct ional i t ies in 
intelligent computer assisted language 
learning. Our intelligent tutoring system 
project is still in its early phases. The 
learner module is based on an empirical 
study of French as used by Acadian 
elementary students l iving in New- 
Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we are 
studying the state of the art of systems using 
Artificial Intelligence techniques as well as 
NLP resources and/or methodologies for 
teaching language, especially for bilingual 
and minority groups.

define the learner model. Then, in the last 
section we propose the system's general 
architecture and an overview some of its 
activities; particularly those that counteract 
Anglicisms by double generating examples in 
standard French and in the local dialect using 
linguistic resources usually used in machine 
translation. 
Introduction 
The project that we have started is intended for 
the minority French speaking Acadian 
community living in Atlantic Canada. In many 
families, parents used to go to English schools 
and sometimes cannot adequately help their 
children in their school work. Children, who 
now go to French schools, often switch back to 
English for their leisure activities because of the 
scarcity of options open to them. Many of these 
children use English syntax as well as borrowed 
vocabulary quite frequently. In brief, this 
setting of language learning is not that of a 
typical native speaker. 
We begin our presentation with a literature 
review of related work in Intelligent Tutoring 
Systems (ITS) particularly on Computer 
Assisted Language Learning (CALL and 
Intelligent CALL) followed by the principles 
that this community is now expecting from 
system builders. In the following sections we 
summarize an empirical study that helped us 
To our knowledge, there are no systems that use 
machine translation tools for generating two 
versions of the same language instead of 
multilingual generation. Another novelty is in 
the pedagogical approach of exposing the 
learner to the expert model and to the learner 
model in a comparative manner, thus helping to 
clarify the sources of error. 
1 Artif icial Intell igence 
Language Learning 
and 
Among the first milestones in Intelligent 
Tutoring Systems (ITS) was Carbonell's ystem 
(1970) that used a knowledge-base to check the 
student's answers and to allow him/her to interact 
in "natural anguage". BUGGY, by Brown and 
Burton (1978) is another system more oriented 
towards student error diagnostic. At around the 
same period researchers were starting to put also 
some emphasis on the teaching strategies 
adopted in the system such as in WEST, Burton 
& Brown (1976). 
It's with such works and many others later, that 
Intelligent Tutoring Systems' architecture was 
more or less separated into four modules: an 
expert's model, a learner's model, a teacher's 
model, and an interface, Wengers (1987). 
However, language learning had its own specific 
difficulties that were not generalized in other 
ITS systems. How to represent the linguistic 
knowledge in the expert and learner models? 
How to implement parsers that can process 
886 
ungrammatical  input? How to implement 
teaching strategies that are appropriate for 
language learning? These are some of the issues 
of high interest, Chanier, Reni6 & Fouquer6 
(1993). 
Recent systems how how researchers are being 
more open to psycho linguistic, pedagogical nd 
applied linguistic theories. For example, The 
ICICLE Project is based on L2 learning theory 
(McCoy et al, 1996); Alexia (Selva et al, 1997) 
and FLUENT (Hamburger and Hashim, 1992) 
are based on constructivism, Mr. Collins (Bull et 
al., 1995) is based on four empirical studies in 
an effort to "discover" student errors and their 
learning strategies. 
Another tendency, that is very noticeably 
parallel to that of NLP, is the development of 
sophisticated language resources such as 
dictionaries for language (lexical) learning as 
exemplified by CELINE at Grenoble (Men6zo 
et al, 1996), the SAFRAN project (1997) and 
The Reader at Princeton University (1997) 
which uses WordNet,  or real corpuses as in the 
European project Camille (Ingraham et al, 
1994). 
The literature review lead us to believe in the 
following basic principles: 
P1. Language is learned in context through 
communication and experience, Chanier 
(1994). 
P2. Language is learned in the natural order 
from receptive to productive. 
P3. Grammatical forms ought to be taught 
through language patterns. 
P4. Vocabulary learning means learning the 
words and their limitations, probability of 
occurrences, and syntactic behavior around 
them, Swartz & Yazdani (1992). 
2 An Empir ical  Study for 
Learner Model 
In an effort to gain some insight into the 
projected linguistic model, an empirical study 
on the population of elementary students in the 
City of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada was 
completed 1. The study consisted of one-on-one 
interviews where the children were presented 
with images having very few possible 
This work was done by A. S. Picolet-Cr6pault within 
her PhD thesis. 
interpretations. The only question that was asked 
was "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" (What is this?). 
In the next sections, we will examine the 
children's answers concerning relative clauses. 
2.1 Subject Relative Clauses 
When the children were asked about the main 
subject in the picture, the answers were 
acceptable in standard French, showing that they 
had no problems in using relative clauses with 
qui. Following are some examples: 
I. C'est une chienne qui boit; 
2. C'est un chien qui boit du iait; 
Some of the answers showed other elements 
concerning lexical use: 
3. C'est un gargon qui kick la balle. 
(Use of an English verb) 
4. C'est une fiile qui botte le ballon. 
(Use of an inappropriate verb) 
5. C'est un papa etson garqon. 
(Bypassing strategy) 
2.2 Object Relative Clauses 
In this part of the experiment, he object of the 
picture was the center of the questions. 
Following are some of the answers with the most 
frequent errors or bypassing strategies, they are 
marked with a *; the sentences with italics are 
the acceptable ones: 
6. C'est le livre que le garcon lit. 
*7. C'est le livre qui se fait lire par la fille. 
*8. C'est le livre h la fille. 
*9. C'est le iivre qu'elle lit dedans. 
*10. C'est un livre, la fille lit le livre. 
The errors seen in these examples constitute 
around fifty percent of the answers given by 
first grade children and are reduced to around 
thirty percent in sixth grade. Answers 7 and 10 
are examples of bypassing strategies i.e.; the use 
of a different verb or another sentence structure 
as a means for avoiding relative clauses. 
Answer 8 shows a common use of the 
preposition h instead of de. Answer 9 is also 
representat ive of the frequent use of 
prepositions at the end of the sentence. 
2.3 Complex Relative Clauses 
The following examples give a brief survey of 
the use of indirect object relative clauses: avec 
lequel / laquelle, sur lequel / laquelle, ~ qui, 
and dont: 
11. C'est le crayon avec lequel elle 6crit. 
* 12. C'est le crayon qui ~crit. 
* 13. C'est le crayon qu'il se sert pour ses devoirs. 
887 
14. C'est la branche sur laquelle est l'oiseau 
"15. C'est une branche que l'oiseau chante sur. 
"16. C'est une branche que I'oiseau est assis. 
17. C'est le garqon ~ qui le monsieur parle. 
* 18. C'est le garqon qui s'assoit sur une chaise. 
"19. C'est le garqon que le monsieur parle. 
20. C'est la maison dont la femme rSve. 
*21. C'est la maison que la dame rSve. 
*22. C'est la maison que la madame rSve de. 
2.4 Error Summary 
By looking at these examples, it is evident that 
complex relative clauses are rather unknown to 
the children. They show that the easiest particles 
for them are qui and que even when misused as 
in answer 12. 
It can also be concluded that they use que in a 
non standard manner every time they need to 
use complex relative clauses. Otherwise they use 
a bypassing strategy by separating the sentence 
into two parts as in "C'est une branche et un 
oiseau", or by using another verb that allows qui 
as in 18. 
3 General System Overview 
The system we are building has a mixed 
initiative, multi-agent architecture. Mixed 
initiative because we want the system to serve 
both the teacher and the student, in both 
teaching and in learning modes. For example, 
the teacher could favor certain activities such as 
presenting examples of "non standard French 
sentences" and opposing them to English 
structures in a effort to show the children some 
Anglicisms; or maybe choose a specific micro- 
world, such as Holloween or Christmas so that 
the exercises would be closer to children's real 
daily experience (principle P1). 
The syntactic graph and the lexicon are 
annotated with probabilities on usually faulty 
expressions in order to intensify the explanation 
or the number of examples and exercises on 
those particular parts (principles P3 and P4). 
We do not intend to build a fully free learning 
environment. The environment is partially 
structured. The user chooses where to start by 
clicking on a hot-button picture. He/she chooses 
the micro-domain and the wanted activities. 
However, unexpected "pop-up" activities would 
come up on the screen from time to time (style" 
Tip of the day" or "TV ad."). 
As this system is being built for young children, 
not every single word is expected to be typed on 
the keyboard. Following are some examples of 
the look and feel of our system: 
1. Children can pick activities from graphical 
images on the screen. 
2. Corpuses or extracts from children stories are 
equipped with hyperlinks to word meanings or 
grammar usage explanations. 
3. Puzzle playing where words have assigned 
shapes according to their functions. Fitting the 
puzzle means placing the words in the correct 
order. 
4. Picking words they like and asking the system 
to make up a sentence; 
All the above possibilities are optional. This 
allows the teacher to take responsibility of the 
degree of unstructured or of focused learning. 
4 GETA's Used Resources 
For many years GETA has been working on MT 
systems from and into French. An impressive 
core of linguistic knowledge is available but has 
not yet been experimented on in building 
language learning software, though work is 
underway for integration of heterogeneous NLP 
components, Boitet & Seligman (1994). Ariane 
for example, uses special purpose rule-writing 
formalisms for each of its morphological and 
lexical modules both for analysis and for 
generat ion,  with a strict separation of  
algorithmic and linguistic knowledge, Hutchins 
& Somers (1992). 
The following modules from GETA were used 
in our experiment 2 : 
A. Morphological agent. 
-ATEF for the morphological analysis sub- 
agent. 
-SYGMOR for the morpho log ica l  
generation sub-agent. 
B. Lexical agent. 
-EXPANSF for lexical expansion 
-TRANSF for translation into standard 
French 
C. ROBRA in its multi-level analysis 
-for syntact ic  tree def in i t ions and 
manipulations 
- for logico-semantic functions 
2 This work was done by Anne Sarti within her 
Master's degree.

The first series of experiments we realized using 
GETA's resources concentrate on double 
analysis/generation of standard French and non- 
standard local French . The corpus consisted of 
the sentences collected during the empirical 
study (see section 2). 
Figures 1 and 2 show an example of the 
annotated trees created by Ariane during this 
C'est la maison que la dame r~ve de

u~('~-a.') \]{o,, . . . . .

cat(d) ? 
double generation of Acadian French and 
Standard French. 
These two graphs how how straight forward was 
the use of language resources for highlighting 
similarities and/or differences in these two 
dialects. Tha same grammar can be used by 
incrementing its rules to include new/different 
sentence structures. The lexicon can be 
augmented similarly.

Another alternative would be to consider the 
non-standard French as a completely new 
language from all points of view. In this case 
only the formalisms at GETA would be 
exploited not the existing linguistic data. 
Conclusion 
We have presented in this paper an ongoing 
software development project that is still in its 
early phases. In the introduction and in the first 
sections, we have argued for the positive effects 
of computers on language learning and then on 
some of the issues that researchers in the field 
are hoping to  see implemented from a 
computational nd a pedagogical point of view. 
We have also seen, through an empirical study, 
the kinds of linguistic difficulties that a minority 
group is encountering. In such a case one 
cannot help but to think about the advantages 
that technology can offer, especially in an era 
where Language resources are ready for the 
pick. We have opted to use the highly 
formalized and parameterized resources at 
GETA in an effort to develop a quickly 
functional prototype that we can immediately 
submit for on-the ground testing.
