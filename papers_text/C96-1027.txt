In the context of the emerging research area o\[' 
computat iona l  semant ics ,  topics re lated to the 
syntax-semant ics  interfime have deserved special 
attention. One such topic is the SUBCAT fbature 
and the inIbrmation encoded in it. 
In I IPS(\] framework, this Ibatuce has been shown 
to be a critical point of art iculation t)etween highly 
autononmus principle-based syntax and semantics 
cmnponents (vd. a.(). Frank and l{(',yl(; 1995). ()n 
the one hand, the SU//CAT list records in\[brnmtion 
about str ict  subcategor izat ion propert ies of the 
corresponding predicator through the nature and 
number  of its elements.  On the other hand, by 
means of' the l inear order h ierarchy assigned to 
these elements, syntactic general izations concerned 
with word order, binding, alternations, etc. are also 
regist, ered (I)ollard and Sag 1987, Ch. 5). 
Recent research,  namely  by l ida, Manning, 
()'Nell and Sag (1994) and Sag and ( iodard (1994), 
brought t;<) l ight evidence that,  contrary Lo what 
was original ly assumed in ( l 'ol lard and Sag 1987; 
1994), those di\['ferent syntactic general izations may 
not be encoded by one and the same ordering of the 
subcategorized elements. This issue was directly 
addressed by Mann ing  and Sag (1995), who 
proposed to recast the SUBCAT intbrmation into 
two diffi;rent lists. 
()ne of the l ists d isp lays  the subcategor ized 
e lements  according to an order relevant to their  
l inear surl~tce concatenation. This "valence" list 
results  from the append of S\[}BJ, SPEC and 
(X)MI)S lists, which are but the result of a previous 
segmentat ion of the SUB(',AT list proposed by 
Borsley (1987) and taken u I) by Pollard and Sag 
( 1994, ('J~. 9). 
The other list, in Lurn, orders the subcategorized 
elements uccm'ding to a hierarchy re lewmt U) se\[ 
up the binding re lat ions between them. This 
"argument" list is the value o\[' the new ARG-S 
fbature. 
In this connection, the crucial point i want  to 
m'gue li)r in this paper is that, in order to increase 
the syntax-semant ics  inter face accuracy,  the 
reshutI l ing of the old SUBCAT list must be \[hrther 
extended.  In par t i cu lar ,  on a par  with its 
segmentation, into sub-l ists and its splillin4; into 
poss ib ly  d i f ferent  ot) l iqueness h ie rarch ies ,  a 
branch, in, g ol)l iqueness order ing should be also 
admitted. 
This paper is deveh)ped along three parts. Fi,'st, 
the mat n a r t  u merits ef Mann i ng and Sag (1995) fi)r

surface concatenation and the ordering tbr binding 
are briefly reviewed. Second, I present empir ical  
justif ication \[i)r the adoption of a non-l inear order

1 Empi r i ca l  Mot ivat ion  fo r  Sp l i t  
Ob l iqueness  
The main arguments presented by Manninv and 
Sag (1995) for spl i t t ing obl iqueness into valence 
obliquene.ss and binding obl iqueness rest  on the 
analysis of two l inguistic phenmnena: reflexives in 
Toba Batak, a western ausLrenesian language, and. 
reflexives in Japanese causative constructions. 
1.1 Toba Batak ref lex ives 
The pair  <)t' senLences in (1) i l lus t ra tes  tile 
dist inct ion between the objective voice, in ( l)a.,  
149  
expressed by the di- verbal prefix and used in 
unmarked contexts, and its active voice 
counterpart, in (1)b., expressed by the mang- 
prefix (Manning and Sag 1995, (16)).

ov-see PM Torus PM Ria 
'Torus sees/saw Ria.' 
b. mang-ida si Ria si Torus. 
nv-see PM Ria PM Torus 
'Torus sees/saw Ria.' 
In Toba Batak there is strong evidence that, in 
transitive constructions, a verb and the following 
NP form a VP constituent regardless of the voice 
chosen. Therefore, the constituent structure of 
(1)a. and b. is presented in (2)a. and b., together 
with the corresponding lexical entry of the verb 
(Manning and Sag 1995, (21), (20)).

Now, the examples in (3) show all the possible 
occurrences of one reflexive NP in the basic 
transitive structures illustrated in (1). In (3)a. and 
a'., the reflexive occurs in objective constructions, 
respectively, as an immediate constituent of VP 
and as an immediate constituent of S. The 
corresponding active constructions are displayed in 
(3)b. and b'. (Manning and Sag 1995, (22), (23)).

The pair of grammatical constructions (3)a'./(3)b. 
confirms that binding principles cannot be defined 
in terms of linear word order or c-command. In 
(3)a'. the antecedent precedes the reflexive, but in 
(3)b. it is the reflexive that precedes the 
antecedent; in (3)b. the antecedent c-command the 
reflexive, but in (3)a'. it is the other way around. 
However, contrary to the assumptions of the 
Binding Theory of Pollard and Sag (1994), also the 
150 
definition of binding principles cannot be based on 
the SUBCAT valence order. This is made evident 
by (3)a. and (3)a'., whose grammatical status is not 
correctly predicted. In (3)a., the reflexive is bound 
by a less oblique element in the SUBCAT list, in 
accordance with Principle A, but the construction is
not acceptable. In (3)b., the reflexive is bound by a 
more oblique element in the SUBCAT list, in 
violation of Principle A, but the construction is 
acceptable. 
The solution adopted by Manning and Sag (1995) 
consists of a three step move: i) to keep the Binding 
Theory unchanged; ii) to create a new list of 
subcategorized elements, which is named ARG-S 
(from argument structure); iii) to define o-command 
relations on the basis of the obliqueness hierarchy 
established on this new list, which may be different 
from the obliqueness hierarchy established in the 
SUBCAT list. 
Let us then see how this solution works for the 
problematic examples in (3). In (4) we find the 
lexical entries of (3) after their reshut~ing 
according to Manning and Sag's proposal (for the 
sake of readability, the representation ofSUBJ and 
COMPS features is omitted).

It is easy to check that the correct predictions are 
made if the relevant o-command relations are 
established on the ARG-S list: the reflexive is now 
coindexed with a more oblique element in 
(3)a./(4)a., and with a less oblique antecedent in 
(3)a'./(4)a'. 
1.2  Ref lex ives  in  Japanese  causat ives  
The other linguistic evidence put forward to 
support this obliqueness plit is the behavior of 
reflexives in Japanese causative constructions, as 
originally argued for by Iida, Manning, O'Neil and 
Sag (1994). 
The analysis of case marking, agreement and 
word order phenomena in Japanese causatives 
reveals that this construction exhibits properties of 
a single clause sentence. 
As to the Japanese reflexive zibun, like English 
reflexives, it must be locally o-bound, with some 
particulars, as for instance its being subject- 
oriented, that is it can be bound only by a subject. 
Now, the example of (5) illustrates that, in the 
context of causatives, zibun is not restricted to 
being bound by the subject of its clause (Manning 
and Sag 1994, (44)). 
(5) a. Tarooi ga Zirooj ni aete 
zibun-zisini/j o hihans-ase-ta. 
Taroo NGM Ziro DAT purposefully 
self ACC criticize-CAUS-PAST 
'Tarooi purposefully made Zirooj criticize 
himselfi/j.' 
Also, pronouns exhibit a special behavior in the 
context of causatives. Contrary to the 
requirements of Principle B, in such contexts 
pronouns may be bound by an antecedent occurring 
in the same clause, but only if it is the subject of 
the causative construction. This is illustrated in (6) 
(Iida et al 1994, (17)). 
(6) Tarooi wa Zirooj ni karei / ~)' o 
bengos-ase-ta. 
Taroo TOP Ziroo DAT he AOC 
defend-CAUS-PAST 
'Tarooi made Zirooj defend himi /~:\].' 
The solution proposed in (lida et al 1994) for 
accounting for the apparent peculiar properties of
binding constraints in causatives relies on the 
assumption that he derived lexical representation 
of a causative verb, like tazune-sase ('made sb. 
visit'), has the form sketched in (7), where tazune is 
the verb 'to visit' and -sase the causative suffix 
(lida et al 1994, (25)).

Consequently, this solution relies also on the 
three basic assumptions adopted fbr the analysis of 
Toba Batak reflexives: i) the principles of Binding 
Theory remain invariant; ii) a new list of 
subcategorized elements, termed ARG-S, is 
adopted; iii) o-command relations are defined on 
the basis of the obliqueness hierarchy established 
in this new list. Moreover, there is a fourth 
assumption which proposes that Principles A and B 
should be validated in at least one of the two 
ARG-S features occurring in the derived lexical 
entry of a causative verbal brm. 
Looking at the lexical representation f causative 
verbs in (7) and the examples (5) and (6), it is easy 
to check that Principle A is satisfied in the lower 
ARG-S list for the binding Ziroo/himself, where 
Ziroo is the subject, and in the upper ARG-S for the 
binding Taroo/himself, where Taroo is now the 
subject. As to the contrast in (6), Principle B is 
satisfied in the lower ARG-S list, where the 
pronoun is locally o-tYee. 
2 Empi r i ca l  Mot ivat ion  fo r  
Branch ing  Ob l iqueness  
Once the binding obliqueness i unpacked from 
the valence list and gets an autonomous status, it 
becomes easier to increase the empirical adequacy 
of Binding Theory, in particular, and the syntax- 
semantics accuracy, in general. In this section I
argue this can be done by letting the ARG-S value 
have a non-linear ordering. 
2.1 Subject-oriented reflexives 
There are languages in which the reflexives, 
though they must be locally-bound, can be bound 
only by a subject. Examples of such languages are 
Malayalam and Hindi, IYom India, Lango ti'om 
Uganda, Bahasa fi"om Indonesia, Japanese, Korean 
and Russian (vd. (Pahner 1994, p. 100if) and 
(Manning and Sag 1995)). Example (8) is taken 
fYom Lango (Pahner 1994, p. \] 01). 
(8) 6k616 i 6kwh6 ~klbfi/ pIrl~ kEn~i/,~l.. 
Okelo asked Alaba about self 
'Okelo i asked Alabaj about himselfi/*j.' 
The solution put forward in (Manning and 
Sag 1995, (6)) to account br this particular sort of 
reflexives is to fbrmulate a new binding principle, 
the A-Subject Principle, where an a-subject is 
defined as the "entity that is first in some ARG-S 
list": 
(9) A-Subject Principle 
Anaphors must be a-subject-bound (in 
some languages). 
Deciding whether the Binding Theory should 
include Principle A or A-Subject Principle depends 
thus on the language which it is being applied to. 
The alternative solution I propose does not 
involve different formulations for binding 
principles or additional principles. In this solution, 
the Binding Theory is kept invariant. One simply 
has to state that, for those languages, like Lango, 
that have subject-oriented reflexives, the binding 
obliqueness hierarchy is not as sketched in (10)a., 
but as in (10)b.. In other words, languages may 
vary with regards to the configuration given to the 
ARG-S value.

2.2 Ch inese  long-d is tance  sub ject -  
oriented zi j i  
Chinese ziji is a subject-oriented reflexive 
pronoun which does not obey either Principle B or 
Principle A. As illustrated in (11), ziji may be 
bound by an antecedent from outside or inside its 
152 
clause, but it cannot he bound by an antecedent 
which is not a subject (Xue et al 1994, (2)).

Zhangsan from l,isi place hear 
Wangwu not like self' 
'Zhangsani beard from Lis!j \[Wangwu k 
does not like himi/;~ j/himsel\[),\].' 
Xue, Polard and Sag (1994) discussed at, length 
the properties of this anaphor. The authors 
elucidated its particulars, namely that zUi is 
inherently animate, and ambiguous between a 
discourse pronoun and a (syntactic) z-pronoun. As 
at z-pronoun it obeys Principle Z (Xue at al. 1994, 
(38)): 
(12) P r inc i~ 
Zq)rmmuns must be o-bound. 
Nevertheless, the authors oflbre(t no solution tbr 
accounting tbr the thct that syntactic ziji is subject- 
oriented. That solution tbllows now naturally and 
iinmediately from the assumption that the 
elements of each ARG-S value receive the non 
linear order of (10)b.. Principle Z alone is thus now 
enough to make the correct predictions about ziji as 
soon as the o-command relations arc established 
over the binding obliqueness hierarchy of multi- 
clausal sentences displayed in (1;{), typical of 
languages with subject-oriented reflexives. 
(13)

Any node in the hierarchy is preceded only by 
subjects because in each (clausal) AR(\]-S value only 
subjects can be less oblique than any other 
argument. 
2.3 Ref lex ives  in  Russ ian  pass ives  
Binding Theory predicts that binding" constraints 
on subcategorized lements may change by virtue 
of' the application of lexical rules. The correctness 
of this prediction is cont\]rmed, for instance, by 
English passives (Pollard and Sag 1994, 
(\]h. 6, (111)). In (14)a., John cannot bind himself. 
I~ ut after tim reordering of subcategorized lements 
by the passive rule, John can now bind himself, as 
shown in (14)b.. The contrast of(14) is correctly 
accounted t'or because John is less oblique than 
himself in (14)b., but it is more oblique in (14)a.. 
(1.4) a. *Himselfshaved,}ohn. 
\[suI ,;AT 
b. John was shaved by himseH:

In cennection with this possibility for lexical 
rules to change obliqueness relations, it would be 
interesting to lind cases where lexical rules change 
o-command relations in a way that the result 
requires a branching configuration. This would be 
an interesting empirical confirmation of the need 
ibr non-linear obliqueness. 
One such case can be fbund in the context of 
Russian passives. Russian sebe is a subject- 
oriented refle, xive. In active constructions it may 
he bound only by the subject. Nevertheless, in the 
context of a passive sentence,, like (15), sebe can 
also be bound by the by-phrase (Manning and Sag 
1994, (9)).

The subject-oriented behavior of sebe in active 
sentences results, like in other languages with 
subject-oriented reflexives, from the non-linear 
ordering of the elements of ARG-S value, with all 
argi (2 _<_ i _< n) being preceded by ar t1 .  As to 
passives in Russian, the lexical rule, among other 
things, must give a new ordering to the ARG-S 
wdue where all ar~i (3 _< i _< n) are preceded only by 
argl and art2.

2.4 Ref lexives in Portuguese oblique 
complements 
Another problematic case for the current Binding 
Theory comes from Portuguese as it fails to make 
the correct predictions for binding patterns 
involving reflexives in the context of verbs with two 
oblique complements. One such verb is 
falar_com_acerca ('talk to about'): 
(17) a. A Maria falou com o Pedro acerca 
do novo Director. 
the Maria talked with the Pedro about 
of_the new Director 
'Mary talked to Pedro about the new 
Director.' 
a'. A Maria fhlou acerca do novo 
Director com o Pedro. 
the Maria talked about of the new 
Director with the Pedro 
'Mary talked about the new Director to 
Pedro.' 
Given the linear order for the ARG-S value the 
current theory assumes, it is predicted that if a 
reflexive occurring as the oblique complement Y is 
grammatically bound by an antecedent occurring 
as the oblique complement X, then X is less oblique 
than Y. Moreover, it is also predicted that the 
reversed binding configuration, where the reflexive 
would occur as the oblique complement X, will be 
ungrammatical. These predictions are sketched in 
the following contrast schemata, where si prSprio is 
a reflexive ruled by Principle A: 
(18) a. A Maria falou \[PREP-X o Pedroi\]oBL. x 
\[PREP-Y si pr6priOi\]oBL_ Y. 
b. *A Maria falou \[PREP-X si p.rSprioi\]OBL_ x 
\[PREP-Y o Pedroi\]OBL_ Y 
The failure of these predictions is illustrated in 
(19), which presents the instanciation of schemata 
(18). In (19)a./a'., PREP-X is made equal to corn ('to') 
and PREP-Y to acerca de ('about'); in (19)b./b'. it is 
the opposite. The pairs a./a', and b./b', simply 
exhibits different surfhce orders of the oblique 
complements in the sentence, a grammatical 
possibility illustrated in (17)a./a'.. In all examples 
the binding of the reflexive is ungrammatical 1. 
1 Vd. Pollard and Sag (94), p. 264, n. 17, for a related 
issue in English. 
(19) a. *A Maria falou corn o Pedro/ acerca de si 
pr6prioi. 
Maria talked to Pedro/about himself'/ 
a'. *A Maria falou acerca de si prSprioi com o 
Pedro/. 
Maria talked about himself/to Pedro/ 
b. *A Maria falou consigo pr6prioi acerca do 
Pedro/. 
Maria talked to himself/about Pedro/ 
b'. *A Maria thlou acerca do Pedro/ consigo 
pr6prioi. 
Maria talked about Pedro/to himselt~ 
This is another puzzle for the current Binding 
Theory which receives a neat solution with a 
branching hierarchy for the ARG-S value. In 
particular, the data presented in (19) receive an 
adequate account if the ARG~S feature of verbs like 
falar_com_acerca is as follows, where the two PP 
complements do not precede each other and a 
reflexive occurring in one of them cannot be bound 
by an expression occurring in the other: 
(20) a. 
\[ARG-S (NP, {PP\[com\]:npro, PP\[acerca de\]:ana}}\] 
b. 
\[ARG-S (NP, {PP\[com\]:ana, PP\[acercade\]:npro})\] 
3 Non- l inear  O-command 
All the solutions proposed for the above binding 
puzzles are similar in the sense that they rest upon 
the same two very simple assumptions. First, the 
Binding Theory remains unaltered, as defined by 
Pollard and Sag (1994, Ch. 6) with the subsequent 
specifications, put forward by Iida, Pollard and 
Sag (1994) and Manning and Sag (1995), that the 
binding principles must be validated on at least one 
of the relevant ARG-S features. Second, the 
elements of ARG-S value may have a non-linear 
order. 
Giving some attention to the first of these two 
assumptions, it is worth noting that not only the 
binding principles remained unchanged, but also 
the formal notions used in its make-up, (e.g. the 
relations of o-command and o-binding) were kept 
unaltered. This worked fine in the examples 
tackled above, but it is expected that a notion like 
o-command, ultimately defined on the basis of the 
precedence relation, may need some further 
specification. This is so because, given the second 
assumption that non-l inear ordering~; are 
acceptable, new cases must be taken into account, 
154 
namely those where the re levant  elements do not 
precede ach other in the hierarchy. 
Consider the definit ion of o-command tbr l inear 
obl iqueness (simplif ied version, (Xue et al 1994, 
(35)): 
(21) (Linear) O-command 
X O-COMMANDS Y i f fX  is a less oblique 
coargmnent of Z that dominates Y. 
\[n case Z=Y, X is said to LOCAI,LY 
o-command Y. 
where X is less oblique than Y iff X precedes Y in 
an ARG-S lisL 
This definition was shown to be adequate for the 
data considered so thr. Notice, however, that  in the 
examples above we were mainly concerned with the 
val idat ion of Pr inciple A. Consequently, in those 
examples one was checking only whether a given X 
preceded a certain Y. For this kind of cases, having 
a l inear  or a branch ing  obl iqueness makes no 
difference tbr the definition of o-command as such. 
Now, when it  is Pr inc ip le  B that  must  be 
va l idated,  it must  be checked whether  a given 
e lement  X does not local ly o-cemmand another  
e lement Y. :If X and Y are not in the same ARG-S 
list, they do not locally o-command each other, 
i r respect ive of the option tbr a l inear or a non- 
l inear  obl iqueness. However, if' they are in the 
same l ist,  assuming  a l inear  or a branch ing  
obliqueness hierarchy makes a difference. 
In a l inear  order, two cases occur: e i ther  X 
precedes Y or Y precedes X. ' l 'heretbre, X does not 
o-command Y iff Y precedes X. (i.e. Y is more 
oblique than X). In a branching order, however, a 
third case also occurs: X is as oblique as Y (they do 
not precede each other). Therefore, we would like 
to have an empirical basis to ascertain whether X 
does not o-command Y in this case. 
Suitable empirical evidence fbr settl ing this issue 
comes from the counterpar ts  of the Portuguese 
examples in (19), where the rellexive is replaced by 
tlhe pronoun ele, ruled by Principle B. (22) presents 
examples where the  pronoun and its antecedent 
occur in the same ARG-S l ist and they are equally 
oblique.

The ungrammat ica l ly  of these examples shows 
that  the pronoun is not locally o-free there and, 
consequently,  it is not the case that  the local 
antecedent does not o-command it. 
The data  fi-om (19) and (22) present  thus the 
empi r i ca l  bas is  for a proper  de f in i t ion  of 
o-command in non-l inear obl iqueness hierarchies. 
(19) shows that,  when X and Y are equal ly oblique, 
it is not the case that  X o-commands Y. (22), in 
turn, shows that, under the same circumstances, it 
is also not the case that  X does not o-command Y. 
Consequently, the definit ion of the o-command 
relation must be adequately specified fbr branching 
obliqueness hierarchies as tbllows (italics indicates 
the specification added to (21)) 2 . 
(23) \[Non-linear~ O-command 
? X ()-COMMANDS Y iff X is a less oblique 
coargument of Z that  dominates Y; 
X LOCALLY o-commands Y if Z=Y. 
? X DOES NOT O-COMMAND Y iff X is not a 
less obl ique coargument  of Z that  
dominates Y and is not as oblique as Y; 
X does not I,OCALI,Y o-commands Y if 
Z=Y. 
Conc lus ions  
It is was shown that  the accuracy of the syntax- 
semantics interface in HPSG grammars,  in general, 
and the empirical adequacy of Binding Theory, in 
par t i cu la r ,  are  improved by a l low ing  the 
oh l iqueness  h ie rarchy  to have a branch ing  
configuration. 
Data involving subject-or iented rel lexives, both 
in act ive and pass ive construct ions ,  subject-  
or iented ref lexive pronouns,  and ref lexives in 
double oblique construct ions presented difficult, 
apparent ly  unre lated,  puzzles tbr the cur rent  
Binding Theory which received a neat  and unified 
solution under the present account.

2 Due to space, constraints other cases where X and 
Y do not precede ach other but  one is not as oblique 
as the other were not discussed in this paper. But it 
will be easy to check that  (23) is adequately defined 
tbr such cases, t:br whose cur rent  ana lyses  the 
improvements proposed here have no impact.
