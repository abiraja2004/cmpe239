Abstract  
The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem 
for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems. 
We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for 
listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of 
compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon 
(Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples ufficiently expressive 
lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those 
representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the 
nouns in a compound provide relational structure nabling compositional interpretation of the 
modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation 
under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument 
selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995). 
We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use 
phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation 
and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural anguage understanding, machine 
translation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be applied 
to multi-lingual information extraction tasks.

1 Introduct ion 
The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguis- 
tic semantics (Bergsten 1911, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1970, Lees 1970, Downing 1977, Levi 1978, 
Warren 1987), and their analysis has presented a serious challenge for natural anguage processing 
systems (Finin 1980, McDonald 1982, Isabelle 1984, Alshawi 1987, Hobbs et al1993, Bouillon et 
al 1992, Jones 1995, Johnston, Boguraev, and Pustejovsky 1995). In this paper, we argue that 
composition in compound constructions involves specification of the arguments of predicate struc- 
tures within the qualia structure of the head noun. In essence, the qualia structure provides the 
'glue' which links together the semantic ontributions of modifying nouns and the head noun in 
the compound. This approach as significant advantages over approaches which introduce abstract 
relations to describe the form of modification i volved (Levi 1978, Jones 1995), in that it assimilates 
the composition of complex nominals to other compositional processes of natural anguage. The 
predicates in the qualia are not there just to account for compounds but also to account for a wide 
variety of forms of composition and interpretation i cluding argument selection, adjectival modi- 
fication, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995). In order to account for the 
availability of compounds and other complex nominals we utilize phrase structure schemata which 
capture the different ways in which head nouns and modifying nouns can compose. We develop and 
illustrate our approach using data from English and Italian. Consider the correspondences below 
in (1). 
(1) a. bread knife b. wine glass c. bullet hole 
coltello d___a pane bicchiere d_.a vino foro d~ pallottola 
d. lemon juice e. glass door f. silicon breast 
succo d_._i limone porta _a vetri seni ~ silicone 
English compounds consist of sequences of nouns. The final noun is the head and the others 
are modifiers. Italian, on the other hand, generally avoids compounds. Most of the compounds 
that are possible involve an underived verb (e.g. portadocumenti (document holder), segnalibro 
(bookmark), spaventapasseri (scarecrow), etc.) 1 In place of the compound construction, Italian 
utilizes post-modifying prepositional phrases to construct complex nominals. 
Consider first the forms in (la) and (lb). In both of these forms the modifying noun provides 
information regarding the purpose or function of object described by the head noun. In (la), bread 
specifies the object which the knife is typically used to cut. In (lb), wine specifies the substance 
that the glass is used to hold. For forms in which the modifier specifies ome aspect of the purpose 
of the head, the preposition in the Italian form generally is da. 
In (lc) and (ld), the modifier relates to the origin of the object described by the head noun, 
how it was brought about. A bullet hole is a hole which was brought about by the passage of a 
bullet, and lemon juice is juice that is brought about by squeezing a lemon. For forms in which the 
modifier specifies ome aspect of the origin of the head, the appropriate preposition for the Italian 
form appears to be di. 
In (le) and (lf), the modifier relates to the constitution of the object described by the head 
noun, what it is made of. A glass door is a door made of glass, while a silicon breast is a breast, 
at least partially, composed of silicon. For forms in which the modifier specifies the constitution of 
the head, the appropriate preposition in Italian is a. 
In English, the form of the semantic relation that holds between the modifying noun and the

78 
head noun is unspecified and left implicit, while in the corresponding Italian complex nominals, 
it is partially specified by the preposition which introduces the modifying noun. This difference 
between English and Italian is representative of a more general difference in structure between 
Germanic languages and Romance languages. Complex nominal expressions in Germanic languages 
frequently involve compounding while complex nominals in Romance languages use post-modifying 
prepositional phrases. One motivation for examination of parallel data from English and Italian 
is that it can reveal the otherwise implicit relation between the elements of an English compound. 
This difference in the internal structure of nominals has important consequences for multilingual 
language processing. For example, in order to translate English complex nominals into Italian you 
need to determine the nature of the semantic relation in the compound in order to determine the 
preposition to use in the Italian form. We return to applications of this work later in Section 7. 
Our analysis of compounds in English and complex nominals in Italian utilizes the representational 
framework of the Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky 1991,1995). The next section provides a 
brief sketch of this approach. 
2 The Generat ive Lexicon 
For the purposes of this paper, we will simplify the representational structure of a GL lexical entry 
to include four levels of representation: type structure, argument structure, event structure (for 
verbs), and qualia structure. The latter in turn expresses four aspects of the meaning of the lexical 
item: FORMAL, CONSTITUTIVE, TELIC, and AGENTIVE. These lexical entries are encoded using 
typed feature structures. The basic layout of the lexical entries we employ is given in (2). 
(2) 
TYPESTR = ~ ARG\ ]  = the  type  of  a

CONSTITUTIVE f f i  parts o f  QUALIA  ffi TELIC = purl~ose of  c~ 
AGENTIVE  = hOW Ol is brought about  
Given this model of lexical representation a noun such as knife has the entry in (3). The 
predicates in the qualia specify the definitional properties of knife. Participants in these predicates 
other than the knife itself are listed as default arguments (D-AR~I, D-ARC2, and D-ARG3) in 
79 
ARGSTR.

CONSTITUT IVE  = {blade,handle,...) 
TELIC = cut_act ( \ [ \ ] ,  \[\], \ [ \ ]  ) 
AGENTIVE = make_act(IX\], E\], \ [ \ ] )  
Representations such as that in (3) are intended to be the values of a CONTENT attribute 
which specifies the semantic ontent of a lexical item. All of the representations for single words 
and complex nominals throughout the rest of the paper consist only of the value of CONTENT.  
The phrase structure schemata presented contain full lexical entries which have a CONTENT 
attribute as well as an ORTH and a DTRS attribute. 
In the following three sections, we will show how the free classes of compounds considered so 
far can be treated as instances of telic, agentive, and constitutive qualia modification respectively. 
3 Te l i c  Qua l ia  Mod i f i ca t ion  
In order to illustrate our approach, we will start with examples uch as bread knife (la), in which 
the modifying noun relates to the purpose of the head noun. The preferred interpretation of this 
compound is that it is a knife which is used to cut bread. The fact that a knife is an object whose 
inherent purpose is to cut things is encoded by the predicate cut_act in the TELIC role (see (3) 
above). The function of the modifier bread is to specify the third argument of the cut__act relation. 
The feature structure associated with bread knife will be as in (4). The first default argument 
D-ARG1 has been specialized from physobj  to bread and this value is structure-shared with the 
third argument position in the cut_act predicate.

FORMAL = \ [ \ ]  
CONSTITUT IVE  = {blade,handle,...} 
TELIC = cut_act( \[~\], \[~\], \[~\], E\]) 
ACENTIVE = make_act(IX\], E\], \ [ \ ] )  
In the GL representation, all of the participants which show up in the predicates in qualia are 
listed as default argument parameters in the ARGSTR. 
In order to account for the availability of compound forms in English, we utilize a family of 
phrase structure schemata. These schemata re essentially the same kind of entity as the Imme- 
80 
diate Dominance Schemata employed in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag 
1994). They are schemata which license the availability of complex nominals, which we treat as 
phrasal signs. These schemata re essentially phrase structure rules. Compounds are licensed and 
interpreted as part of the process of parsing. 
The combination of words into compound forms could also be captured using lexical rules 
(Flickinger 1987, Pollard and Sag 1987). We have chosen to use phrase structure schemata rather 
than lexical rules on the basis of storage considerations. Each lexical rule used for compounds will 
license a great many modifiers for large number of potential heads. If the lexical rules are used at 
a pre-compilation stage in order to flesh out the lexicon, allowing lexical rules for compounds will 
result in a massive increase in the size of the lexicon. For each noun, a huge number of compound 
forms will be generated. If you allow lexical rules for compounds to apply at runtime during the 
parsing process, then the storage problem is avoided, but then they are really not any different 
from phrase structure schemata. 
We will show the schemata as rules here. They can also be encoded as single feature structures. 
The basic structure of the schemata licensing the combination of nouns to form noun compounds 
is as in (5). 
MODIF IER  NOUN HEAD 
=:~ 
(5) 
COMPOUND 
DTRS = I HEAD -- 
The schemata differ with respect o the constraints placed on the CONTENT values and the way 
in which the CONTENT values of the head and the modifier are composed to generate the CONTENT 
for the compound as a whole. The availability of compound forms such as bread knife, where the 
modifier specifies an argument in the TELIC, is accounted for by the schema in (6). 
MODIF IER  NOUN HEAD 
CONTENT = \[OONTENT -- D\] 
COMPOUND 
(6) 
MOD = 
In this notation, the structures describing semantic types are the values of an attribute CON- 
TENT, and ORTH specifies the orthographic form. The CONTENT of  the resulting compound is 
inherited from the head noun. In order to access the argument in the TELIC, the CONTENT value 
of the modifier is structure-shared with the first default argument in the CONTENT of the head. 
The modifying noun must be of semantic type individual  and its CONTENT value is structure- 
shared with the D-ARG1 in the ARGSTR of the resulting compound. The lexical representation 
of the compound also contains an attribute DTRS containing a HEAD and a MOD value. These 
are structure-shared with the lexical representations for the head noun and the modifying noun 
81 
respectively. 
This schema is one of a number which are used to license this kind of modification of default 
arguments. There will also be schemata for modification of other default arguments. The fact that 
the CONTENT of the compound always comes from the head noun is captured by having all of the 
compound phrase structure schemata, which are themselves implemented as types, all inherit the 
constraint specified by the structure-sharing i dex E\]. 
As we saw before, if the modifier specifies an argument in the TELIC qualia role, the preposition 
in Italian is da. In order to account for the Italian forms, as in the English case, we utilize phrase 
structure schemata. In this case, the schema (7) specifies that the sequence HEAD NOUN, da, 
MODIFYING NOUN can be interpreted as having the semantic ontent of the modifying noun 
specify one of the arguments within the TELIC role. 
HEAD MODIFIER NOUN 
\[\]\[ORTH = ~ \ [~\ ] \ ]da  ~\[ORTH = fl ~ ind iv idua l \ ]= .  ~ 
COMPOUND 
fORTH = a da fl 
I. t M?D = 
The indeterminacy with respect o which argument in the TELIC is coindexed with the modifier 
in schema (7) is a shorthand representation. A number of phrase structure schemata are used, each 
specifying linking to a different argument position in the TELIC. 
For Italian, the nature of the modification can alternatively be directly encoded in the lexical 
entry for the preposition. The composition could then licensed by a more general phrase structure 
schema which would work with all of the different prepositions. 
4 Agent ive Qualia Modif icat ion 
Compounds uch as bullet hole and lemon juice (1 c,d), in which the modifier elates to the origin 
or bringing about of the object described by the head noun, are treated as modification of the 
AGENTIVE role. In the case of lemon juice, the head juice will have a squeeze_act as its AGENTIVE 
and the object squeezed will be listed as a default argument. The function of the modifying noun 
lemon is to further subtype this argument. This is possible because lemon is a subtype of fruit. 
These English forms will be accounted for by another schema licensing default argument type 
specification, like that in (6) above. The resulting representation for lemon juice is as in (8). The 
corresponding forms in Italian utilize the preposition di. The Italian forms are accounted for by a 
schema like (8), except hat the preposition is di and the linkage is to the AGENTIVE qualia role.

5 Constitut ive Qualia Modif ication 
Another common function of modifiers in complex nominals is to specify a subpart of the denotation 
of the head noun or the material of which it is composed. Examples of this are given in (1 e,f). 
In our treatment, his involves modification of the CONSTITUTIVE role. The prepositions used in 
Italian for this: sort of modification are a and al. The modifiers glass and silicon denote materials. 
When composed with nominals uch as door and breast hey specify elements of the CONSTITUT IVE  
role. For example, glass door is represented as in (9). These forms are licensed using further phrase 
structure schemata for English and Italian. 
(9)

FORMAL = hold( E l '  \ [ \ ] )  
CONSTITUTIVE = { \ [ \ ]g lass}  
TELIC = walk_through_act( \[~\], E \ ] ,  \ [ \ ] )  
AGENTIVE = make.act( \[~-\], El, E\]" \ [ \ ] )  
The basic pattern established so far is that modification of TEL IC ,  AGENTIVE ,  and  CONSTITUT IVE  
involves da, di, and a, respectively. This is a useful generalization but the correspondence b tween 
the different qualia roles and different choices of preposition in Italian is not as clear cut as this 
suggests. In the examples of TELIC qualia modification considered so far (1 a,b), the modifying 
noun was always of type indiv idual .  Matters become more complex when compounds in which 
the modifying noun describes an event are considered. These are addressed in the next section. 
6 Telic Event Modifiers 
In some forms where the modifier describes an event, the appropriate preposition in Italian is da, 
as in the forms in (10), while others the preposition is di, as in the forms in (11). 
(10) a. hunting rifle b. race car c. carving wood 
fucile d._._a caccia macchina d__a corsa legno d___a intaglio 
(11) a. destruction weapons b. credit card c. rest home 
axmi d i distruzione carta d~ credito casa d~ riposo 
d. concentration camp e. divorce procedure 
campo d_..i concentramento procedura di divorzio 
In general, the TELIC use of  the preposition di appears to select consistently for modifiers which 
denote events. Even though this does not yet explain the difference between (10) and (11), it 
already provides us with a restriction on the use of prepositions. In other words da selects for 
any type, while di is restricted to events. We assume the Vendlerian distinction between activities, 
states, accomplishments, and achievements. In addition, we adopt a decompositional view of event 
structure, as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991), in which the event structure representation of a 
lexical item makes reference to the configurational properties of subevents and arguments. In 
83 
this framework, which allows us to make fine grained distinctions between event types, we can 
determine the selectional properties of di and da, on the basis of the event type of the modifiers. 
Nominals such as hunting, race, and carving describe activities. Nominals such as destruction, 
credit, and so on, in (11) above, describe the result of an activity. This distinction arises quite 
clearly in the glosses of (10) and (11). Compound forms such as hunting rifle or race car in (10), 
describe respectively an instrument which is used when hunting, and a vehicle that is driven for 
the purpose of racing. Conversely, the reading of the compounds in (11) makes explicit the result 
which is achieved by using a particular object. In particular ( l la)  refers to weapons that bring 
about destruction; ( l lb)  to a card that brings about a credit, and so on. 
Unlike the operation which derives bread knife by associating the modifier to an argument 
position in the TELIC role of bread, the compositional operations which involve events produce 
a more complex structure. We argue that compounds where the modifying noun describes an 
event, such as those in (10), involve co-composition of the qualia structures of the head and the 
modifier. The resulting representation has a complex TELIC role with "sub-qualia". In the case 
of hunting rifle, the TELIC of rifle, which is fire provides the AGENTIVE within the TELIC of the 
compound. The modifier hunting is a process nominal and provides hunt  as the TELIC within the 
TELIC of the compound. Through the application of phrase structure schemata which constrain 
this co-composition, we obtain the representation in (12) for hunting rifle. 
? hunt ing  rifle

activityAcp 
QUALIA ffi TELIC = TELIC = hunt( ~\ ] , \ [~\ ] ,  \ [ \ ] )  
AGENTIVE = f i re (~_ J ,  \[~\], \ [ \ ] )  
The interpretation of the compound form hunting rifle can be glossed as follows:"a rifle which is 
used in its typical capacity (i.e. firing) for the purpose of performing the activity of hunting." The 
assignment of a complex structure to an individual quale is coherent with the general interpretation 
of qualia structure. Exploiting these recursive properties of event-denoting qualia is not an ad-hoc 
move to account for the interpretation of complex nominals but is also motivated by the behavior 
of agentive nominals and their semantic ontribution in context (cf. Busa 1996). 
The modifying noun in Italian complex nominals with the preposition di describes the result 
that is achieved by performing the particular function associated with the head noun. The nominal 
destruction, in ( l la) ,  unlike the event nouns hunting and race which denote activities, is the nom- 
inalization of the transitional event denoted by the verb destroy. The two subevents, namely the 
process and the resulting state, in the event structure representation f the verb, are encoded in 
the nominalized form as separate vents in the AGENTIVE and FORMAL roles, and they are related 
by the relation of temporal precedence <o~. As argued in Pustejovsky (1995) this representation 
gives rise to the polysemous behavior of the nominal. It alternates between a processand a result 
interpretation. In destruction weapon, the embedded AGENTIVE in the TELIC is again the TELIC of 
the head weapon, and the embedded TELIC is the resulting state from the semantics of destruction.

The resulting TEL IC  is a process-resul t - lcp,  as shown in (13).

The analysis of AGENTIVE  modification is also more complex. In addition to di, della is also 
found for subtyping of arguments in the AGENTIVE .  In other cases, such as morte da annegamento, 
death from drowning and bruciatura da sole, sun burn, the preposition is da. This preposition da 
has a different meaning from the one associated with the TELIC. It corresponds to the English 
preposition from and it is interpreted as introducing an experiencing relation. It is found in cases 
where the head noun is an event and the modifier introduces the causal factor which brought about 
that event. We turn now to consider some of the applications of this work in more detail. 
7 Applications 
The analysis of complex nominal constructions presented in this paper has a range of important 
applications in natural language processing. Complex nominals play an important role in the 
encapsulation and expression of nominal concepts and are frequent in a wide variety of types of 
texts. Therefore, the ability to handle complex nominals is essential for parsing and generation 
systems for either English or Italian. It is important o note that systems utilizing compositional 
apparatus for the analysis of complex nominals need not treat all compounds compositionally. The 
optimal arrangement will be to list frequent and idiosyncratic ompound forms in the lexicon and 
use the compositional pparatus for forms which are not listed, or in instances when the listed 
interpretation is ruled out by context. We would also like to point out that we do not expect to 
develop an analysis which will handle all and every compound form. Our target is to have an 
account which will handle the majority of productive compounding patterns. Another important 
use of the compositional pparatus described here is in lexical acquisition of compound forms. 
This machinery can be used to indicate potential interpretations for compounds. A human editor 
can then select the appropriate interpretation from the candidate set and add have the compound 
added to the lexicon. 
Given the range of different semantic relations that can hold between the elements of a complex 
nominal, they are frequently ambiguous. English compounds are worse than Italian post-modified 
forms in this respect, since in Italian the preposition gives at least some indication of the relation 
involved. The approach described in this paper constrains the interpretation of complex nominals 
using the type system. For example, the schema in (6), which accounts for bread knife, requires the 
modifying noun to be typed as indiv idual .  This limits the set of potential modifiers to those typed 
as indiv idual .  Since the content of the modifier is structure-shared with an argument position 
85 
within the TELIC, this set of potential modifiers is further constrained by type constraints imposed 
by the relation in the TELIC role. The cut_act will require the object cut to be a separable object. 
It could potentially require the cutter to be significantly harder than the object to be cut. Type 
constraints of this kind serve to greatly reduce the degree of ambiguity in a given complex nominal, 
but it will still generally be the case that more than one interpretation is predicted for a given form. 
For example, a form like bone knife could be interpreted either as a knife used for cutting bone or a 
knife made of bone. The approach described here needs to be integrated with further mechanisms 
and heuristics in order to determine the best guess for complex nominal interpretation i any 
given case. One important class of mechanisms are those which examine the current sentential 
and discourse context in order to restrict the range of interpretations. For example, if bone knife 
appears in a medical text, bone most probably specifies the object to be cut by the knife, while if it 
shows up in a text concerning prehistoric man, bone most probably refers to the constitution of the 
knife. One way in which compounds can be further disambiguated is through the incorporation of a 
statistical model as one of the heuristics employed in determining the appropriate interpretation. In
such an approach, one could train on a data set comprised of compounds paired with an indication 
of the relation holding between the head and the modifier. The resulting model would provide the 
probability that a given complex nominal involves a particular kind of modification relation. In 
order to have useful predictive power, it would be best to assign semantic types to the elements of the 
complex nominal and determine the probability that a complex nominal consisting of words of types 
A and B involves modification relation C. Given the sparsity of data to support a statistically based 
approach we believe that the way forward in this area is to pursue the integration of a rule-based 
approach with a statistical model. Such integration has already proven effective in the treatment 
of sense extension phenomena (Copestake and Briscoe 1995). We leave further investigation of this 
integration for future work. 
This work also has important consequences for applications in multilingual natural language 
processing. The most obvious of these is the use of a cross-linguistic approach to complex nominals 
in machine translation. Translation of complex nominals from Italian to English will be more 
straightforward, since there is a loss of information rather than a gain. It is important o note, 
however, that not all Italian complex nominals involving post-modification can be translated as 
noun-noun compounds in English. For example, forms such as coltello d._..a macellaio (literally, knife 
of butcher), in which the modifier is an agent using the object described by the head, does not 
translate as butcher knife. In English, the appropriate nominal construction i  this case uses the 
possessive: butcher's knife. 
Translation from English to Italian is substantially more difficult given the difference in ex- 
plicitness regarding the semantic relation between the head and modifier. In order to generate 
the proper output in Italian, it is necessary to determine the relation between the elements in the 
English compound structure and to determine the appropriate preposition in Italian for expression 
of that relation. One approach to this task is to use the GL representation language ssentially as 
an interlingua (McDonald 1995). The phrase structure schemata for English are used in order to 
determine potential interpretations for a given English compound construction. The most likely 
interpretation from the candidate set is picked on the basis of contextual and statistical models. 
The CONTENT of the chosen candidate is then matched against he outputs of the various phrase 
structure schemata used for Italian. When an appropriate schema is identified it is instantiated 
with lexical items from the Italian lexicon in order to generate the Italian translation. An im- 
portant feature of this approach is that it utilizes resources which are independently needed for 
analysis of the languages involved. Aside from translation, the phrase structure schemata can also 
be used for multi-lingual generation. If a particular concept is encoded in the GL lexical represen- 
tation language, the language-specific phrase structure schemata can be employed to generate the 
86 
corresponding complex nominal in each language. 
In addition to the importance of successful translation of complex nominals for full-text machine 
translation, this functionality is useful in itself for applications in multi-lingual information retrieval 
and information extraction. Since complex nominals are so frequently used to coin terms which 
encapsulate important distinguished concepts within a domain, their successful identification and 
processing is an essential element of determination of the topic of a text and the:, provide important 
hooks for information retrieval. In a multi-lingual setting, such as information retrieval over the 
World Wide Web, it may be desirable for a search for a complex nominal from one language to 
yield documents regarding the same concept in other languages. The approach to translation of 
complex nominals described above enables this functionality. For a given form compound form in 
English it is possible to determine potential realizations of that form in Italian. 
8 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have shown how the theory of qualia structure within the Generative Lexicon, en- 
ables a compositional treatment of compounds. In compounds where the modifying noun describes 
an individual, in composition, the modifier further specifies the type of an argument to a predicate 
in the TELIC, AGENTIVE, or CONSTITUTIVE role. In Italian, the canonical prepositions for these 
three kinds of modification are da, di, and a, respectively. In compounds where the modifying noun 
denotes an event, the composition i  the compound frequently involves co-composition between the 
qualia structure of the head and modifier. In Italian, for TELIC modification the preposition is da 
when the modifier describes an activity and di when the modifier describes a result. In addition 
to its theoretical relevance, the approach to the semantics of complex nominals described here has 
important applications in the construction of natural anguage processing systems. In particular, it 
provides the foundations for machine translation of complex nominals between English and Italian 
and can be readily applied in multi-lingual generation and multi-lingual information extraction.
