I. Introduction 
Many researchers in linguistics, 
psychology, philosophy and artificial 
intelligence have recently begun to 
abandon a purely linguistic approach to 
definite anaphora <*2> in favor of a 
notion of reference into some kind of 
model of the discourse, cf. Karttunen 
\[1976\], Levin & Goldman \[1978\], Lyons 
\[1978\]. Stenning \[1975\]. My own research 
on definite anaphora (cf. Webber 
\[1978a&b\]) follows this approach, in 
particular making the following five 
assumptions: 
i. One objective of discourse is to 
enable a speaker to communicate to a 
listener a model s/he has of some 
situation. Thus the ensuing 
discourse is, on one level, an 
attempt by the speaker to direct the 
listener in synthesizing a similar 
model. 
2. Such a discourse model can be viewed 
as a structured collection of 
entities, organized by the roles 
they fill with respect to one 
another, the relations they 
participate in, etc. 
3. The function of a definite anaphoric 
expression is to refer to an entity 
in the speaker's discourse model 
(DMs). <*3> In using a definite 
anaphor, the speaker assumes 
(a) that on the basis of the 
discourse thus far, a similar entity 
<*i>. The author's current address is: 
Department of Computer and Information 
Sciences, The Moore School, University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA 19174. 
<*2>. Although I will soon explain what I 
mean precisely by "definite anaphora", the 
term basically denotes a function that 
some types of syntactic expressions can 
serve. Expressions which can function as 
definite anaphors include definite 
pronouns and definite descriptions. Other 
roles that definite pronouns and 
descriptions can fill are discussed in 
Geach \[1962\], Partee \[1972\], Norman & 
Rumelhart \[1975\] and Webber \[1978a\]. 
<*3>. A similar assumption is made by 
Karttunen \[1976\], Levin & Goldman \[1978\], 
Lyons \[1978\] and Stenning \[1975\]. 
will be in the l istener's model 
(DML) as well and (b) that the 
lis?ener will be able to access that 
entity via the given definite 
description or definite pronoun. 
4. The referent of a definite anaphor 
is thus an entity in DMs, which the 
speaker presumes to have a 
counterpart in DM L. Discourse 
entities may have the properties of 
individuals, sets, events, actions, 
states, facts, beliefs, hypotheses, 
properties, generic classes, typical 
set members, stuff, specific 
quantities of stuff, etc. 
5. In deciding which discourse entity a 
definite anaphor refers to, a 
listener's judgments stem in part 
from how the entities in DMT are 
described. (When a discourse ~ntity 
E is the referent of a definite 
anaphor A, one might distinguish 
that description of E conveyed to 
the listener by the immediately 
preceding text and consider it A's 
antecedent.) 
The point of making these assumptions 
explicit is to stress that insofar as 
reasoning about discourse entities is 
mediated by their descriptions, discourse 
entity descriptions are critical to 
anaphor resolution. 
Now one consequence of these 
assumptions about discourse models and 
reference is that the task of 
understanding definite anaphora can be 
decomposed into several complementary 
parts: 
i. deciding whether a definite pronoun 
or definite description is truly 
anaphoric (i.e., is intended to 
refer to some entity presumed to 
already be in DML) or whether the 
term fills some other role in the 
discourse; 
2. synthesizing a discourse model which 
is similar to that of the speaker 
and inhabited by similar discourse 
entities; 
42 
3. constraining the possible referents 
of a given anaphoric express ion down 
to one possib le choice - the 
"anaphor resolut ion" problem; 
4. determining what other funct ions a 
def inite descr ipt ion is intended to 
fill besides enabl ing the l istener 
to construct or get to its referent. 
While I cannot hope in this short 
paper to cover even one of these four 
sub-tasks, what I shall try to do is 
i l lustrate how the expl ic i t  data - i.e., 
the actual sentences of the discourse,  
produced by a part icular  person (or a 
part icular computer program) in a 
part icular s i tuat ion  - provide mater ia l  
for the model synthesis process. In 
part icular,  I shall show (i) how 
indef inite noun phrases are associated 
with the evocat ion of new discourse 
entit ies, independent ly  of any 
higher- level  expectat ions,  and (2) how 
those new discourse ent i t ies will 
init ial ly be described. I wil l  c laim that 
such an initial descr ipt ion (ID) is 
cr it ical  to both model synthesis and 
anaphor resolut ion since it al lows the 
l istener to reason appropr iate ly  about the 
discourse entity in order to assign it to 
an appropr iate role v is -a-v is  his or her 
higher- level  expectat ions.  <*4> 
Moreover, since it is possib le for a 
d iscourse entity's current role ass ignment 
to be found incorrect, it is the ent i ty 's  
ID that al lows it to be re-ass igned to 
another role with respect to the 
l istener's revised expectat ions.  
In Section 2 I wil l  consider 
indefinite noun phrases v is-a-v is  the 
discourse entit ies they evoke and how 
those entit ies are described. I wil l  
contrast  them br ief ly with non-anaphor ic  
def inite noun phrases and then show that 
all determined noun phrases, including odd 
ones like "few orc eggs", "many lemon gum 
balls",  etc. pattern after either 
def in i tes or indef inites v is-a-v is  the 
discourse entit ies they evoke and how 
those entit ies can be described. In 
Section 3 I wil l show how this approach to 
def inite anaphora  in terms of d iscourse 
entit ies and their descr ipt ions can 
accommodate certain problemat ic  cases of 
anaphoric reference that have been 
discussed in the l inguist ics and 
phi losophic  l i teratures - the famous 
"donkey" sentence (cf. Bartsch \[1976\], 
Edmundson \[1976\], Hint ikka & Carlson 
\[1977\]) and the problem of reference in 
d is junct ive contexts (cf. Karttunen 
\[1977\]). Finally, to show that it is not

d iscussions of the re lat ionship between 
the expl ic i t  text and higher- level  
organiz ing structures can be ~ found in 
Coll ins, Brown & Larkin \[1977\] and Webber 
\[1978b\]. 
just def in ite and indef inite noun phrases 
that can evoke ent i t ies in the l istener 's  
d iscourse model, I wil l  i l lustrate in 
Sect ion 4 an example of de ic t ica l ly -evoked 
ent i t ies and comment on the problem of 
descr ib ing them appropr iately.  
2. Indef in i te Noun Phrases and Discourse 
Ent i t ies  
Except after a copula, indefinite 
noun phrases <*5> may evoke a new 
discourse entity into a l istener 's  
d iscourse model. <*6> What I want to 
focus on here is appropr iate IDs for them. 
Consider the fol lowing sentences. 
la. Wendy bought a ye l low T-shirt that 
Bruce had liked. 
b. It cost twenty dol lars. 
2a. Each third-grade girl brought a 
pel ican to Wendy's house. 
b. She is roosting them on her front 
lawn. 
3a. If Bruce manages to catch a fish, 
b. he will eat it for dinner. 
4a. John didn't  marry a Swedish woman. 
b. She was Norwegian. 
5a. Whether Bruce buys a mini -computer  
or an Advent TV, 
b. he will have to do the repairs on it 
himself.  
6. Every man who owns a donkey beats 
it. 
I c laimed earl ier that the init ial 
descr ipt ion (ID) of a newly-evoked 
discourse entity is cr i t ical  for both 
model synthesis and anaphor resolut ion, 
since the ID mediates all reasoning about 
the entity until its ass ignment to some 
role within the model. An ent i ty 's  ID 
should imply neither more nor less about 
it than is appropriate.  Now consider what 
an appropr iate descr ipt ion would be for 
the discourse entity that "it" refers to 
in sentence lb. It is not "the yel low 
T-shirt that Bruce had l iked", since 
sentence  la. can be uttered truthful ly  
even if Bruce had liked several yel low 
T-shirts (and both speaker and l istener 
were aware of that fact). Nor is it "the 
yel low T-shirt that Bruce had l iked and 
that Wendy bought", since sentence la. can 
<#5>.  i wi l l  often .... refer to these  as 
"existent ia ls"  because of their logical 
interpretat ion as existent ia l  quanti f iers.  
<*6>. An indefinite noun phrase fol lowing 
a copula functions together with the 
copula as a predicate, e.g. 
Bever ly is a bargain hunter. 
Bruce became a l ibrarian. 
As such, it is purely descr ipt ive and does 
not refer to any part icular l ibrar ian or 
bargain hunter, cf. Kuno \[1970\]. 
43 
be truthful ly  uttered even if Wendy had 
bought several such T-shirts. What is an 
appropr iate descr ipt ion for the referent 
of "it" is something like "the yel low 
T-shirt  that Bruce had l iked and that 
Wendy bought and that was ment ioned in 
sentence la." 
What I am claiming is that in the 
case of a singular existent ia l  that is not 
within the scope of either negation, a 
universal  quanti f ier,  a hypothet ica l  (e.g. 
"if", "suppose") or one of several other 
special  contexts (cf. Webber \[1978a\]), the 
ent i ty  it evokes wil l  be appropr iate ly  
descr ibed via a conjunct ion of (i) the 
descr ipt ion inherent in the noun phrase 
(e.g. "yel low T-shirt  that Bruce had 
admired");  (2) a predicate that embodies 
the remainder of the sentence (e.g. "which 
Wendy bought");  and (3) a predicate that 
relates that ent i ty to the utterance 
evoking it (e.g. "which was ment ioned in 
(or evoked by) sentence 6a."). This is 
the descr ipt ion that I am cal l ing the 
ent i ty 's  " init ial  descr ipt ion" or ID. 
Given how I speci f ied its components then, 
it should not be surpr is ing that I wil l  
c la im that the ID of an 
ex is tent ia l ly -evoked d iscourse ent i ty can 
be derived from an appropr iate ly  
structured sentence- level  logical 
representat ion.  Such a representat ion is 
independent ly mot ivated by its use in 
regular inference procedures.  
Using a somewhat s impl i f ied vers ion 
of the formal ism descr ibed in Webber 
\[1978a\], a simple rule can be stated for 
forming the ID of an ex is tent ia l ly  evoked 
discourse entity - i.e., 
(Ex:C) F x ==> 
(Ezi z = ix: Cx & F x & evoke S,x 
Here (Ex:C) is an example of restr icted 
quant i f icat ion,  in which C represents an 
arbi t rary predicate which x satisf ies.  Fx 
represents an arbi t rary open sentence in 
which x is free; i stands for Russel l 's  
def in i te operator,  iota; and S is the 
label assigned to the propos i t ion on the 
left -hand side of the arrow. Informally,  
this rule, which I shall  call \[RW-I\], says 
that if a proposi t ion S states that there 
is a member x of class C which makes F. 
true, then there exists an individua~ 
descr ibable as "the C which F's which was 
evoked by proposi t ion S". This individual 
is taken to be the discourse ent i ty evoked 
by the existent ia l  noun phrase. For 
example ,  let Y stand for the predicate 
corresponding to "yel low T-shirt  that 
Bruce had l iked". <*7> Then sentence la. 
can be represented simply as 
<*7>. I wil l soon be more precise about 
the representat ion of relat ive clause 
contain ing noun phrases. Here, where the 
descr ipt ive part of the noun phrase can be 
treated as an unanalyzed unit, the 
predicate name Y is an adequate 
representat ion.  
(Ex :Y )  . Bought Wendy, x 
Since this matches the left -hand side of 
the above rule, it fol lows that 
(Ez) . z = ix: Y x & Bought Wendy,x 
& evoke Sla,X 
That is, there is an individual 
descr ibable  as "the yel low T-shirt  that 
Bruce had liked, that Wendy bought and 
that was evoked by sentence la." The 
d iscourse entity so descr ibed is the 
referent of "it" in sentence lb. 
Examples 2-6 i l lustrate singular 
indef inite noun phrases in some of the 
special  contexts noted above. Whi le I 
wil l  only be discussing examples 5 and 6 
in this paper, notice that in all five 
cases, the entity evoked by the indef inite 
noun phrase is appropr iate ly  descr ibed by 
taking into account at least the three 
factors ment ioned above. That is, in 
example 2 the referent of "them" can be 
descr ibed uniquely as "the set of 
pel icans,  each of which, ment ioned in 
sentence 2a., some third grade girl 
brought to Wendy's house." <*8> In 
example 3, the referent of "it" can be 
descr ibed as "the fish ment ioned in c lause 
3a. that Bruce has managed to catch, if 
Bruce has managed to catch a fish". In 
example 4, the negat ion appears intended 
to scope only "Swedish".  Thus the 
d iscourse entity referent of "she" can be 
descr ibed as "the woman ment ioned in 
sentence 4a. that John marr ied".  (We 
later learn in sentence 4b. that she is 
Norwegian rather than Swedish.) IDs for 
the two other ex is tent ia l ly -evoked 
d iscourse ent i t ies in examples 5 and 6 
wil l  be d iscussed in Sect ion 3. 
Notice that a def in i te noun phrase in 
the same context as an indef inite noun 
phrase wil l  also evoke a d iscourse entity, 
but one whose ID is somewhat di f ferent.  
To see this, consider the fol lowing 
sentences.  
< '8> A rule simii&r {o \[RWLi\] is g~ven 
in Webber \[1978a\] for ex istent ia ls  scoped 
by universals.  In all, six such rules are 
given, covering 
i. independent ex istent ia ls  (sg/pl) 
"I saw {a cat, three cats} on the 
stoop." 
2. def in i te  descr ipt ions (sg/pl) 
"I saw the {cat, cats\] which hate(s) 
Sam."  
3. d is t r ibut ives  
"Each cat on the stoop hates Sam." 
"The three cats each scratched Sam." 
4. universal ly  quant i f ied ex istent ia ls  
"Each boy gave each girl {a peach, 
three peaches}." 
5. class dependent  def in i tes  
"Each boy gave a woman he knew the  
{peach, two peaches} she wanted." 
6. class dependent  d is t r ibut ives  
"Each boy I know loves every woman 
he meets." 
44 
7a. Wendy bought the yel low T-shirt  that 
Bruce had liked. 
b. It cost twenty dol lars.  
8a. Each third grade girl has seen the 
pel ican on Wendy's  lawn. 
b. They prefer it to the plast ic  
f lamingo she had there before. 
9a. John didn't  marry the Swedish woman. 
b. He threw her over for a Welsh 
ecdysiast.  
In each case, an appropr iate descr ipt ion  
for the discourse ent i ty evoked by the 
singular def in i te noun phrase is just that 
singular def in i te noun phrase itself - 
"the yel low T-shirt that Bruce had l iked", 
"the pel ican on Wendy's  lawn", "the 
Swedish woman". While it is certa in ly  
true that the def in i teness  of these noun 
phrases may be cont ingent  on context 
(i.e., ident i f iab i l i ty  with in the 
speaker 's  model of the under ly ing 
s ituat ion),  nevertheless  unlike ent i t ies 
evoked by indefinite noun phrases,  those 
evoked by def in i tes do not depend for 
their appropr iate IDs on the part icu lar  
sentences the def in i te noun phrases 
appeared in. 
The same character is t ic  behavior of 
def in i tes and indef in i tes d iscussed for 
singular noun phrases holds for plural  
noun phrases as well. That is, whi le both 
indef inite and def in i te plural  noun 
phrases evoke discourse entit ies,  the 
unique initial descr ipt ions  that can be 
assigned to those ent i t ies wil l  di f fer in 
the two cases. To see this, consider the 
fol lowing example. 
10a. I saw the guys from "Kiss" on TV 
today. 
b. I saw the three guys from "Kiss" on 
TV today. 
c. I saw all three guys from "Kiss" on 
TV today. 
d. I saw some guys from "Kiss" on TV 
today. 
e. I saw three guys from "Kiss" on TV 
today. 
ii. They were being interviewed by Dick 
Cavett. 
Sentences 10a-c each contains a def in i te 
plural  noun phrase. That noun phrase 
should evoke a d iscourse ent i ty into the 
l istener 's  model, one appropr iate ly  
descr ibed as "the (set of) guys from 
'Kiss'" This can be ver i f ied by 
fol lowing either of these sentences by 
sentence ii and cons ider ing what is the 
referent of the def in i te pronoun "they". 
<*9> 
<*9>. While Sentences 10b&c. prov{de the 
addit ional  information that the number of 
guys in "Kiss" is three \[not actual ly  true 
- BLW\], that information is not needed in 
order to descr ibe the set uniquely. 
Sentences 10d&e, on the other hand, 
each contains an i~def in i te plural  noun 
phrase. That noun phrase wil l  evoke a 
d iscourse ent i ty appropr ia te ly  descr ibed 
as "the (set of) guys from 'Kiss' that I 
saw on TV today and that was ment ioned in 
Sentence 10d(e)." This is because either 
sentence is cons istent  with there being 
other members of "Kiss" whom I d idn' t  see 
on TV today, as well as other members whom 
I did see but whom I don't  mean to include 
in my statement. <'10> Notice again that 
the set size informat ion provided in 
sentence 10e. is not necessary for 
descr ib ing that set uniquely. However, it 
too may be useful later in resolving 
def in i te  anaphora. 
An interest ing point  is that there 
seem to be no other patterns that Engl ish 
determiners  fo l low v is-a-v is  d iscourse 
ent i ty IDs. To see this consider the 
fo l lowing sentences. 
12a. Few l inguists  smoke since they know 
it causes cancer. 
b. Few l inguists were at the party, but 
they drank more than the whole Army 
Corps of Engineers. 
13a. Many l inguists smoke al though they 
know it causes cancer. 
b. Not many l inguists smoke since they 
know it causes cancer. 
c. Many l inguists don't  smoke since 
they know it causes cancer. 
In sentence 12a, the referent of "they" is 
the d iscourse ent i ty appropr ia te ly  
descr ibed as "(the entire set of) 
l inguists".  That is, "few <x>s" can evoke 
the same discourse ent i ty as the def in i te 
noun phrase "the <x>s". However as 
However, it should not be ignored, as it 
may be needed later in resolv ing a 
def in i te anaphor like "the three guys". 
<'10>. This latter point is a subtle one, 
and usage may vary from person to person. 
That is, some people intend an indefinite 
plural noun phrase contained in a sentence 
S - "Some <x>s P" - to refer to the 
maximal  set - i.e., "the set of <x>s which 
P". Other people intend it to refer to 
some subset of that set - "the set of <x>s 
which P which I (the speaker) intended to 
ment ion in sentence S". For a system to 
cope with this var iat ion in usage, it 
would be better for procedures to der ive 
the latter, non-maximal  set descr ipt ion,  
which is always appropr iate.  If a system 
is sophist icated enough to associate a 
"bel ief  space" with the speaker (cf. Cohen 
\[1978\]), other procedures can later access 
that bel ief  space (if necessary or 
desirable) to judge whether the maximal 
set interpretat ion might have been 
intended. (This wil l  again become an 
issue when I d iscuss other determiners  
like "many" and "several".) 
45 
sentence 12b. shows, "few <x>s" can also 
pattern after the indefinite plural:  the 
referent of "they" is the entity 
appropr iate ly  descr ibed as "the 
just -ment ioned set of l inguists who were 
at the party". (We learn from "few" that 
this set is small or smaller than the 
speaker expects.) 
"Many", on the other hand, seems to 
pattern only after the indefinite plural.  
In sentence 13a., the referent of "they" 
is appropr iate ly  descr ibed as "the 
just -ment ioned set of l inguists who 
smoke". (We learn from "many" that this 
set of l inguists is large or larger than 
the speaker expects.) Sentence 13b. shows 
that the reverse polar i ty  "not many" acts 
l ike "few" v is-a-v is  evoking discourse 
entit ies:  the referent of "they" is the 
entire set of l inguists. However as 
sentence 13c. shows, a NEG which occurs in 
the sentence auxi l iary does not ef fect  
this same change in behavior:  "they" 
refers to the just -ment ioned set of 
l inguists who don't  smoke. 
3. TWo Interest ing Reference Problems 
Recall  that the purpose of this paper 
is to point out the importance of 
descr ipt ion formation to both d iscourse 
model synthesis and reference resolut ion 
and to show that this process can, to an 
important degree, be formalized. I have 
taken as given the notion that a l istener 
is using both the d iscourse and his or her 
knowledge of the world to synthesize a 
model of what s/he bel ieves to underl ie 
the discourse. Def inite anaphora are 
viewed as means by which the speaker 
refers to ent i t ies in DM s that are 
presumed to have counterparts  in the 
l istener 's  model. What I want to show in 
this section is that this approach to 
def in i te anaphora can accommodate not only 
st ra ight - forward cases as d iscussed above, 
but cer ta in  problemat ic  cases as well. 
3.1 Parameter ized Individuals 
The problem of formal ly 
character iz ing the referent of "it" in 
examples like 6 below has often been 
d iscussed in the l inguist ics and 
ph i losophy  l i teratures,  cf. Bartsch 
\[1976\], Edmundson \[1976\], Hint ikka & 
Car lson \[1977\]. 
6. Every man who owns a donkey beats it. 
The problem has been taken to be that 
whi le "it" intui t ively seems related to 
the embedded noun phrase "a donkey", there 
is no way to represent this log ica l ly  in 
terms of simple quanti f ier  scoping. What 
I shall show is that an approach in terms 
of d iscourse ent i t ies and their IDs makes 
this intuit ive re lat ionship simple both to 
expla in and to represent. 
First notice that this problem arises 
independent ly  of how the matr ix  noun 
phrase is determined. 
14. A man I know who owns a donkey beats 
it. 
15. The man who owns a donkey beats it. 
16. Which man who owns a donkey beats 
it? 
17. No man who owns a donkey beats it. 
In all these examples, "it" seems 
intui t ively related to "a donkey". 
Informally,  one might  descr ibe its 
referent as "the just -ment ioned donkey he 
owns", where "he" is bound to whatever 
value that "(each, a, the, which, no) man 
who owns a donkey" may take. But this is 
just a d iscourse ent i ty of a rather 
special  type - one with a parameter ized 
ID, rather than a rigid one. I call such 
ent i t ies "parameter ized individuals",  
borrowing the term from Woods & Brachman 
\[1978\]. <*ii> 
Notice that parameter ized indiv iduals 
behave somewhat d i f ferent ly  from the 
"actual" d iscourse ent i t ies the sentences 
evoke. <'12> That is, parameter ized 
indiv iduals all have the same ID, 
independent of how the noun phrase 
contain ing the relat ive clause is 
determined. On the other hand, the actual 
d iscourse ent i t ies evoked by these 
sentences do not. For example, 
18a. Each man who owns a donkey beats it. 
it = the donkey he owns 
b. However, the donkeys are p lanning to 
get back at them. 
the donkeys = the set of donkeys,  
each of which some man 
who owns a donkey owns 
them = the set of men, each of whom 
owns a donkey 
19a. The man I know who owns a donkey 
beats it. 
it = the donkey he owns 
b. But the donkey is p lanning to get 
back at him. 
the donkey = the just -ment ioned 
donkey that the man I 
know who owns a donkey 
owns 
him = the man I know who owns a 
donkey 
20a. Which man who owns a donkey beats 
it? 
<*ii>. The phrase "parameter~zed 
individual" is being used somewhat loosely 
to include "parameter ized" sets, stuff, 
etc. For example, 
(i) No man who owns two donkeys beats 
them. 
them = the two donkeys he owns 
<'12>. By "actual" d iscourse entit ies,  I 
mean ones that can be referred to 
anaphor ica l ly  in subsequent sentences.  
46 
it = the donkey he owns 
-- "None" 
b.*Are the donkeys planning to get back 
at {him, them, ???}? 
the donkeys = ??? 
c.*Is the donkey planning to get back 
at {him, them, ???}? 
the donkey = ??? 
To show that this approach to 
def inite anaphora in terms of d iscourse 
entit ies and their descr ipt ions can 
expl icate "donkey" sentences as well, I 
wil l  have to introduce a bit more of the 
formal ism descr ibed in Webber \[1978\]. 
That bit involves an extension of 
restr icted quant i f icat ion,  cf. \[RW-I\] 
above. In restr icted quant i f icat ion,  a 
quant i f icat ion operator (e.g. ?,E), the 
var iable of quant i f icat ion and the class 
it ranges over (noted impl ic i t ly  as a 
predicate) const i tute a structural  unit of 
the representat ion.  For example, "Every 
boy is happy" can be represented as 
(?x:Boy) Happy x 
This is truth funct ional ly  equivalent  to 
(?x) . Boy x ==> Happy x 
Simi lar ly "Some boy is happy" can be 
represented as 
(Ex:Boy) Happy x 
which is truth funct ional ly  equivalent  to 
(Ex) Boy x & Happy x 
The extension I wil l introduce will 
permit the representat ion of noun phrases 
with relat ive clauses as well as simple 
noun phrases. Semantical ly,  a relat ive 
clause can be viewed as a predicate.  One 
way to provide for arbitrary predicates is 
through the use of the abstract ion 
operator, represented as " " by Hughes & 
Cresswel l  \[1968\], fol lowing Church \[1941\]. 
For example, the noun phrase "a peanut" 
can  be represented as 
(Ex:Peanut) 
whi le the noun phrase "a peanut that Wendy 
gave to a gori l la" can be represented as 
(Ex: ~(u:Peanut)  \[(Ey:Goril la) 
Gave Wendy,u,y\]) 
In this case 
~(u:Peanut) \[(Ey:Goril la) 
Gave Wendy,u,y\] 
names a unary predicate which is true if 
its argument is a peanut that Wendy gave 
to some gori l la. 
Using this notation, sentence 6 can 
be represented as 
(?x:~(u:Man) \[ (Ey:Donkey) . Own u,yJ) . 
Beat x , IT  
By applying rule \[RW-I\] to the embedded 
clause \[(Ey:Donkey) . Own u\], the ent i ty 
evoked by the existent ia l  can be 
identi f ied as 
iy: Donkey y & Own u,y & evoke S6.l ,U 
"the just -ment ioned donkey that u owns" 
<'13> 
As I ment ioned above, the semantics of 
restr icted quant i f icat ion is such that the 
var iable of quant i f icat ion,  here x, 
sat isf ies the predicate in the 
restr ict ion.  Thus if x sat isf ies 
~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) . Own u,y\], there 
must be an entity ident i f iable as 
iy: Donkey y & Own x,y & evoke S 6 l,y 
"the just -ment ioned donkey x owns ~ 
This is a parameter ized individual - 
parameter ized by the var iable in (?x:...) 
- that is a possible referent for "it" in  
the matrix sentence - i.e., 
(?x:~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) . Own u,y\]) 
Beat x, iy: Donkey y & Own x,y 
& evoke S6.l ,y 
"Every man who owns a donkey beats the 
just -ment ioned donkey he owns" 
I noted above that a sentence like 
"Every man who owns a donkey beats it" 
could sensibly be fol lowed by a sentence 
like "However, the donkeys are planning to 
get back at them" (cf. example 18). Given 
that I have shown how to account for the 
referent of "it" in the first sentence in 
terms of d iscourse ent i t ies and their 
formally der ivable descr ipt ions,  can the 
referent of "the donkeys" be account for 
in the same way? <'14> 
To show that it can, I need to 
present the rule for deal ing with class 
dependent def inite descr ipt ions that I 
ment ioned in footnote 8. This rule is 
motivated by examples such as 21, where  
the referent of "them" is presumably the 
discourse entity evoked by the noun phrase 
"the flower she picked", where "she" 
stands for the variable bound by "each 
girl in the class". 
<'13>. In label ing each clause of a 
complex sentence, I use the fol lowing 
convention: if the matr ix clause is 
label led S, its leftmost embedded clause 
will be label led S.I, the leftmost 
embedded clause in S.I wil l  be label led 
S.I.I, etc. 
<'14>. I shall not take the time here to 
discuss the path from the phrase "every 
man who owns a donkey" to the discourse 
entity informally descr ibable as "the set 
of men, each of whom owns a donkey", since 
it is rather stra ightforward,  cf. Webber 
\[1978a\]. This ent ity is a possible 
referent for "them" in sentence 18b. 
47 
21a. Each girl in the class gave Ivan the 
flower she picked. 
b. He arranged them art fu l ly  in an 
empty Glenf iddach bottle. 
This is a def in i te noun phrase, but 
because of its binding to the 
d is t r ibut ive ly  quant i f ied noun phrase 
"each girl",  it wil l  evoke a d iscourse 
ent i ty  with the propert ies  of a set rather 
than an individual (cf. example 8). In 
this case, it wil l  be "the set of f lowers, 
each of which was the flower that some 
girl  in the class picked". S impl i fy ing 
for brevity here, this rule can be wr i t ten 
(Vx:K) . P x , iy :C  x,y ==> 
(Ez) . z = {ul (Ex:K) . u = iy:C x,y} 
where K represents an arb i t rary  unary 
predicate which x sat is f ies and both P and 
C represent  arb i t rary b inary predicates.  
The r ight-hand side of this rule implies 
that in case the left -hand side matches 
some sentence, there wil l  be a d iscourse 
ent i ty roughly descr ibable  as "the set of 
u's, each of which is the thing that 
stands in relat ion C to some member of K". 
Notice now that after the "it" is 
resolved in "Every man who owns a donkey 
beats it" (see above), the sentence 
matches the left -hand side of the above  
rule - i.e., "Every man who owns a donkey 
beats  the  jus t -ment ioned  donkey  he owns .  
Thus it fol lows that there is a d iscourse 
ent i ty  descr ibable  as "the set of donkeys, 
each of which is the just -ment ioned donkey 
that some man who owns a donkey owns" - 
i.e., 
{wl (Ex:~(u:Man) \[(Ey:Donkey) Own u,y\]) 
w = iz: Donkey z & Own x,z 
& evoke Sl8,Z} 
This is a possib le referent for "them" in 
sentence 18b. 
3.2 Dis junct ion 
The other class of prob lemat ic  
examples that I want to d iscuss here in 
terms of d iscourse ent i t ies and their 
descr ipt ions  is one I f irst encountered in 
Kart tunen \[1977\]. Karttunen presents 
examples like the fol lowing. 
22. If Wendy has a car or Bruce has a 
bike, it wil l  be in the garage. 
23. Bruce can have either a bike or a 
car, but he must keep it in the 
garage. 
24. Either Bruce has ~a new car or he has 
borrowed his brother's.  In any 
case, it is b locking my driveway. 
25. Whether Bruce buys a car or his 
brother buys a bike, he wil l  have to 
keep it in the garage. 
The problem is again to determine just 
what it is that "it" refers to. 
I see two ways of approaching this 
problem in terms of d iscourse ent i t ies and 
their IDs. One way holds that in each 
sentence,  each term of the d is junct ion  
evokes a d i f ferent  d iscourse ent i ty into 
DML, each with a d i f ferent  ID: 
(22) "the car that Wendy has (if she has 
a car)" 
"the bike that Bruce has (if he has 
a bike)" 
(23) "the bike that Bruce wil l  have (if 
he chooses a bike)" 
"the car that Bruce wil l  have (if he 
chooses a car)" 
(24) "the new car that Bruce has (if 
Bruce has a new car)" 
"Bruce's brother 's  car" 
(25) "the car Bruce wil l  have bought (if 
he buys a car)" 
"the bike Bruce's brother wil l  have 
bought (if Bruce's brother buys a 
bike)" 
The truth of the d is junct ion  (which seems 
in each case to be interpreted as 
exc lus ive "or") then guarantees there 
being one and only one ent i ty in the model 
to which "it" refers. Not ice that if the 
terms were conjo ined rather than 
dis jo ined,  the truth of the con junct ion 
would imply the s imultaneous ex istence of 
two ent i t ies with in the model.  In that 
case, either the referent of "it" would be 
ambiguous or the sentence would just be 
bizarre. 
The other, I think nicer, way of 
approaching the problem holds that each 
sentence evokes only a s ingle d iscourse 
ent i ty into the model,  with the indecis ion 
(i.e., the dis junct ion) embodied in its 
ID. That ID is of the form "A if P, 
otherwise B". For example,  the ent i ty  
evoked by sentence 22 would be descr ibab le  
as "the car that Wendy has (if she has a 
car) or the bike that Bruce has 
otherwise";  that evoked by sentence 23 
would be descr ibable  as "the bike that 
Bruce wil l  have (if he chooses a bike) or 
the car that Bruce wil l  have otherwise";  
that evoked by sentence 24, as "the new 
car that Bruce has (if he has a new car) 
or Bruce's brother 's  car otherwise";  and 
that evoked by sentence 25, as "the car 
Bruce wil l  have bought (if he buys a car) 
or the bike Bruce's brother wil l  have 
bought otherwise".  
One advantage to this approach is 
that addit ional  propert ies  which 
t ruthfu l ly  fo l low from either ID can be 
ascr ibed to the ent i ty without  committ ing 
onesel f  to one descr ip t ion  or the other. 
This can be useful in anaphor resolut ion.  
For example, in sentence 24, the subject 
48 
of "block my driveway" must be a physical  
object, preferably large and somewhat 
mobile. This condit ion is sat isf ied by 
the discourse entity evoked by sentence 
24, independent of which ID is 
appropriate. 
Although there may be other ways to 
approach the problem of dis junct ion,  the 
"donkey" problem, and the whole problem of 
def inite reference in general,  what I hope 
to have shown in these two sections is the 
robustness of an approach based on notions 
Of  a discourse model, d iscourse entit ies 
and their formally derived descr ipt ions.  
4.  Conc lus ion  
In arguing for the importance of 
descr ipt ion formation to both discourse 
model synthesis and reference resolut ion, 
I concentrated on how indefinite noun 
phrases evoke new entit ies into the 
l istener's discourse model and how their 
appropr iate initial descr ipt ions (IDs) 
could be derived from a formal 
sentence- level  representat ion of the text. 
There are many other ways in which 
discourse entit ies can be evoked, and many 
interest ing problems in forming 
appropr iate descr ipt ions of them. I wil l 
conclude therefore with a brief d iscuss ion 
of de ict ica l ly -evoked discourse entit ies 
and the problem of descr ib ing them 
appropriately.  
The example comes from the chi ldren's  
book Babar Loses his Crown by Laurent de 
Brunhoff,  and involves the fol lowing 
situation: Babar, King of the Elephants, 
decides to take his wife Celeste and his 
family on a trip to Paris. In packing for 
the trip 
"Babar puts his crown in a l itt le 
red bag." (p.3) 
They travel by train and then by taxi to 
their hotel in Paris, and when they arrive 
"Celeste opens all the bags. Last 
of all, she opens the l itt le red 
one. 'Look!' she cries. 'What is 
this? A flute! Babar! This is not 
your bag!' " (p.l~) 
Before this point in the story, there 
should have been one l itt le red bag in 
DM L. Now there should be two. The first 
is the ex is tent ia l ly -evoked discourse 
entity (say, e43 ) - "the l itt le red bag 
mentioned in sentence <x> that Babar put 
his crown in". However if "this" on 
page 10 is not that entity, then it must 
be some other one (say, e~8) ~ How should 
it be descr ibed? Since "thlS presumably 
points to the l itt le red bag Celeste is 
opening, e48 can appropr iate ly  be 
descr ibed as "the just -ment ioned l itt le 
red bag which Celeste is opening, which 
contains a flute and not Babar's crown, 
and which is not equivalent  to e43". <'15> 
The problem here is to be able to 
a r t i cu la te  c lear ly what each of these 
propert ies  derives from since they do not 
come from a single sentence. In this 
case, one must determine what things 
relevant to the story do or do not fol low 
from e48's not being Babar's bag.

In this paper, I have tried in as 
brief a way as possible to reveal an 
aspect of understanding def inite anaphora 
that precedes the more frequent ly 
d iscussed problem of "anaphor resolut ion".  
This aspect involves account ing for what 
it is that def in ite anaphors refer to and 
how such things become avai lable. I moved 
from the notion of reference into a model 
to problems of how that model is 
synthesized, and in part icular ,  how the 
entit ies in it are appropr iate ly  
described. In this endeavor, I focused on 
the initial descr ipt ions (IDs) ascribed to 
ex is tent ia l ly -evoked entit ies, br ief ly 
touching upon de ict ica l ly -evoked entit ies 
as well. This paper has just skimmed the 
surface of a very large problem. In 
part icular,  one must stil l  account for, 
inter alia, reference to actions, events, 
processes,  stuff, quant i t ies of stuff, 
etc.; re lat iv izat ion of descr ipt ions to 
the speaker's  bel iefs (cf. Cohen \[1978\], 
Prince \[1978\]); addit ional  ~ descr ipt ions 
derived from the various roles in 
higher- level  s i tuat ions that an entity is 
assigned to; effects of tense, modal ity,  
negation, etc. on descr ipt ion formation; 
and how descr ipt ions change over time. 
Some of these problems (as well as others) 
are discussed further in Webber \[1978a&b\], 
and much interest ing work remains to be 
done.

<'15>. Throughout this approach, I am 
making no assumptions about the 
separateness of d iscourse entit ies. That 
is, I am not assuming that two discourse 
entit ies are necessar i ly  and for all t imes 
dist inct,  unless it is speci f ied 
expl ic i t ly  as was done here. Two 
discourse entit ies may have incompatible 
descr ipt ions and as a consequence be 
assumed to be dist inct.  But I do not v iew 
it as impossible for two separate ly  evoked 
discourse entit ies with d i f ferent  but 
compatible descr ipt ions to later be found 
to be one and the same.
