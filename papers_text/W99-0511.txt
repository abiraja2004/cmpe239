Abstract 
Using standard methods and formats 
established at LADL, and adopted by several 
European research teams to construct large- 
coverage electronic dictionaries and 
grammars, we elaborated for Portuguese a set 
of lexlcal resources, that were implemented in 
IN'rEX We describe the main features of 
such linguistic data, refer to their mmntenance 
and extension, and gwe different examples of 
automatic text parsing based on those 
dictionaries and grammars 
Keywords Text parsing, large-coverage 
dictionaries, computational lexicons; word 
tagging, information retneval. 
1 Introduction and Background 
The French DELA system was conceived and 
developed at LADL (Laboratoire d'Automatlque 
Documentaire et LmgmstIque) It includes 
monohngual hngulstlc resources (mainly for 
French and English) specifically elaborated to be 
integrated into NLP systems Standard methods 
and formats-have been defined and are now used 
by other national teams working on their own 
languages German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese 
and Spanish Within that common framework, 
important fragments of the descnptmn of the 
languages involved have been worked out the 
syntactic and semantic properties of free and 
frozen sentences are descnbed and formalized e~s 
for the lexicon, a major component of NLP, large 
coverage lectromc dlctionanes have been built 
Simple and compound words have been 
descnbed, and their hnguIstlc haracteristics have 
been hand-coded by computational lexicographers 
using a common method 
Most of these lex~cal resources can now be 
imported into the Intex NLP system ~, and then 
automatically applied to large texts Within the 
scope of this article, we describe the set of lexical 
resources built so far for Portuguese, and we gwe 
different examples of automatic Portuguese text 
parsing 
2 Portuguese Electronic Dictionaries 
By electromc dictionary, we mean a computerized 
lexicon specifically elaborated to be used tn 
automatic text parsing operations (indexing, 
recognition of complex words, technical and 
common, etc ) Thus, large coverage lectronic 
dlctlonanes were built for Portuguese for that 
purpose 
The set of lexIcal data is organized according to 
the formal complexity of the lexlcal units The 
Portuguese DELAS IS the central element of the 
d~ctionary system Itcontains more than 110,000 
simple words, whose grammatical ttributes are 
systemaucally described and encoded The set of 
compound words Is structured m the Portuguese 
DELAC At the moment, it Is constituted by a 
lexicon of 22,000 compound nouns and 3,000 
frozen adverbs, so it is stdl far from adequate 
completion 2 
2.1 The DELAS and DELAF Dictionaries 
As said before, DELAS is the dIctmnary of simple 
words We understand by simple words the lexlcal 
units that correspond to a continuous tring of 
i See http//www ladl lUSSleu fr/IN'I~X/mdex htm ll 
2 The French DELAC contains (Sdberztem (1997 189) 
about 130,000 entries 
74 
letters The lexlcal entnes of DELAS have the 
followmg general structure 
<word>, <formal description> 
where word represents the canomcal form (the 
lemma) of a simple lexlcal umt (m general the 
masculine smgular for the nouns and adjecuves, 
the mfinmve for the verbs), and formal 
description corresponds to an alphanumenc code 
contzanmg mformat~on on the grammatical 
attributes of the entries their grammatical c ass 
(eventually, sub-class), and their morphological 
behavior 
The mflected forms are automaucally generated 
from the association of a lemma to an mflecuonal 
code the hst of all reflected words constitutes the 
Portuguese DELAF (1,250,000 word forms) 
In Portuguese, the major grammatical classes 
nouns, adjectives and verbs have mflected forms 
-nouns  and adjectives can appear m the 
femmme and/or m the plural, they can recewe 
dtmmuUve and augmentaave suffixes, the 
superlative degree of the adjectives can be 
expressed by morphological means (suffixes), 
-verbs  are conjugated (mood, tense, person, 
number), furthermore, some verbal forms can 
undergo formal mo&ficattons reduced by the 
presence of a clmc pronoun 
Thus, the DELAS entries 
gato, NOID1 
gordo, AOIDIS1 
(where N and A mdtcate that gato (cat) ts a noun 
and gordo (fat) Is an adjective, 01 corresponds to
the mflectlon rule for mascuhne, feminine, 
smgular and plural, DI and $1 exphclt he type of 
dtmmuttve and superlative suffixes that can be 
accepted by these entries) produce the following 
infected forms (DELAF entnes) 
gato, gato N ms (cat) 
gata, gato N fs 
gatos, gato N mp 
gatas, gato N fp 
gatmho, gato N Dms (httle cat) 
gatmha, gato N Dfs 
gattnhos, gato N Dmp 
gatmhas, gato N Dfp 
gordo, gordo A ms (fat) 
gorda, gordo A fs 
gordos, gordo Amp 
gordas, gordo A fp 
75 
gordmho, gordo A Dins (rather fat) 
gordmha, gordo A Dfs 
gordmhos, gordo A Dmp 
gordmhas, gordo A Dfp 
gordlsslmo, gordo A Sms (very fat) 
gordfsstma, gordo A Sfs 
gord?sstmos, gordo A Stop 
gord\[sstmas, gordo A Sfp 
As for the verbs, for mstance, dar (to gwe) 
dar, VO2t 
gives rise to a hst of 73 reflected forms that 
correspond to the normal conjugation of a non- 
defective verb, in addmon, dar can be constructed 
with clmc pronouns (t), m the posmon of 
accusative and dative complements So, m 
(1) Nds demos o hvro ~ Maria 
(Lit We gave the book to Maria) 
the verb form demos expresses mdlcatlve mood, 
past tense, and first person plural 
From a syntactic point of view, dar Is constructed 
with three arguments, ubject Nds (we) and two 
complements o hvro (the book), fi Maria (to 
Maria) The complement syntacuc posmons can 
be fulfilled by clmc pronouns, respecavely, o (it), 
accusative, and lhe (her), dauve, as m 
(2) N6s demo-lo ~ Maria 
(Lit We gave tt to Maria) 
(3) N6s demos-lhe o hvro 
(Lit We gave her the book) 
(4) Nds demos-lho 
(Lit We gave her_t0 
In (2), the direct object has been chttclzed, and, 
due to historical phonetic reasons, both the 
accusative pronoun and the verb have undergone 
formal modifications o>lo, demos>demo In (4), 
both pronouns (dative and accusative) are 
obhgatonly agglutinated, forming the contraction 
lho ( <lhe + o) 
So, even though the analysts of the combinations 
verb-chttc Is a syntactic matter, given the 
morphological changes reduced by such 
combinations m Portuguese, a first descnptlon 
had to be made at the morphcqegtcal level 
On the other hand, the example m (4) dlustrates a 
case where the formal notion of simple word does 
not correspond to an adequate hngutstlc analys~s 
Indeed, the form lho results from the contraction 
of two Independent oronouns lhe + o In 
Portuguese, contracted forms Issued from the 
agglutmatton of two different words (and two 
different grammaucal categones) are commonly 
observed We give some simple examples of 
contracuons resulting from the merging of 
preposmons with determiners, pronouns and 
adverbs 
pel(o,a, os, as) < por + (o,a, os, as) 
(by the) 
del(e,a, es, as) < de + (ele, ela, eles, elas) 
(of (him, her, them)) 
daqut < de + aqut 
(from here) 
The relationship between contractions and their 
base constituent categories are estabhshed by 
finite-state ransducers ( ee below) 
2.2 Dictionaries for Compounds 
Compound words, l e, lexical units that are 
constituted by a fixed combination of s~mple 
words, represent a large amount of the lexicon of 
any language One has only to underline m a text 
the sequences of words that are frozen together to 
some extent o realize that compounds constitute 
an important percentage ofthe text 3 It is therefore 
illusory to envisage any sort of automatic 
processing before a slgmficant lexlcal coverage is
achieved. The Issue is even more acute if one 
considers the description of sclenttfic or technical 
texts or any speciahzed lexicon, where the 
number of compounds can rise up to appalhng 
figures 
As said in 2 compounds are structured m the 
Portuguese DELAC Priority was given tO the 
hstlng and formahzatlon of compound nouns, that 
can mflect lua de mel - luas de mel (honeymoon), 
and to compound adverbs, that are invariable de 
repente (suddenly) From the point of view of the 
lexicon, the mare focus, especially as far as 
compound nouns are concerned, has been the 
every-day, not too techmcal, lexicon 
In order to ~dentlfy compound words, and 
dlstmgulsh them from formally Identical word 
free combinations, a set of morpho-syntactlc 
criteria was adopted (Ranchhod (1991), Bapttsta 
(1995)) In short, compounds are the sequences of
words that present restncUons to the 
See 5 ~Parsmg Texts Using INTEX Tools- 
combinatorial properttes that they were supposed 
to have 
The formallzauon of compound tcuonary entries 
is slmdar to that of simple words Since 
compound adverbs, preposluons and conjunctions 
do not reflect, their formats are rather s~mple 
de repente, ADV+PC 
(suddenly) 
para corn, PREP 
(towards) 
afire de, CONJ 
(m order to) 
Compound nouns, however, have generally 
reflected forms The rules for the mflect~on of
compound nouns presented by grammarians do 
apply to some cases, but most compound nouns 
exhibit mflecuonal restrictions on gender or 
number that cannot be accounted by the 
morphological properties of their constituents In 
the DELA format, the inflectional properties of 
compound nouns are specified according to the 
same criteria s m the dictionary of simple words 
Thus, g~ven the following nominal entries of the 
DELAC 
ser(21)humano(Ol), N + NA ms - + 
(human being) 
guerra frta, N + NA fs - - 
(cold war) 
vtstta(30) de estudo, N + NDN fs - + 
(field trip) 
The first two compound nouns, ser humano and 
guerra frta have an internal structure Noun 
Adjective (NA), the most productwe class m 
Portuguese, vtstta de estudo ~s a compound of 
structure Noun de Noun, also a very productwe 
one Each entry is characterized by the posslbdlty 
(+) or lmposstbtllty (-) of gender and number 
reflection, respecttvely, the elements of the 
compound that can be inflected receive the 
mflecuonal code that they have m the DELAS 
both constltuents of ser humano inflect (in 
number) according to, respectively, the rules 21 
and 01 ser humano - seres humanos, guerra frta 
is invariable, and the noun vlstta de estudo only 
allows the inflection of vtstta vtstta de estudo - 
vtsttas de estudo 
As well as for other languages (e g French), 
addluonal mformat~on Is being added, namely 
semantic 
76 
2.3 Local Grammars  
Most of the local hngutstgc phenomena, s well as 
many complex sentences, are represented m a 
natural way by the formalism of finite-state 
automata (FSA) For instance, frozen or semt- 
frozen structures are very naturally described by 
graphs, that represent FSAs (Sllberztem (1997)) 
We illustrate the use of graphs with an elementary 
example, selected from the hbrarles of Portuguese 
local grammars This grammar descnbes a family 
of adverbial expressions (dates), which refer to a 
period of ttme around the middle of the months 
(or, by extensmn, of some years) as m the 
underlined expression 
lsso aconteceu nos tdos de Marfo 
(That happened on the ides of March) 
\ / ?a l M~

@N~ - 
--'" ~ .... ,: t~,,,,,,, IO,,z.,,t(, 
The following examples how how transducers 
are used to analyze contracuons, ambtgumes and 
compound numerical determiners 
3.1 Analys is  of  Contracted Words 
As stated above (2 1 ), contracted forms resulting 
from the agglutination of two independent words 
are commonly observed nn Portuguese To 
properly analyze these entrees we built flmte state 
transducers (FST) that, given a contracted form, 
produce an output corresponding to the 
decomposition of the contractxon into ~ts base 
constituents For xnstance, the FST 
(de, ~ t~q~,,Al~ 
F~g 2 - Analysis of the contracted form daqut 
decomposes daqut (a contraction of the 
preposmon de (from) and the adverb aqut (here)) 
m ~ts base constituents and, s~multaneously, 
associate to them the grammatical reformation of 
the dtcuonary

Fig 3 - Analysis of the contracted forms dele, 
dela, deles, delas 
From the graphs of the local grammars, parsers 
(FSTs) can be automatically constructed, that 
applied to texts m combination with the 
dictionaries, allow the detection of a large variety 
of hngmstlc patterns (see below) 
3 Transducers  
Finite-state automata and transducers can be 
efficiently apphed at various levels of hngutstm 
analysis

ts used not only to decompose the contracted form 
dele m its base consmuents but to dlsamb~guate 
the pronouns ele, ela, eles, elas Identical FSTs 
can be used to analyze more complex situations 
where both constituents of a contraction can 
mflect mdependently 4 
b) Dtsambiguatwn fo r  tagging 
In Portuguese, a word such as compra can be 
either a noun or a verb, the form o can be a 
determiner, a demonstranve pronoun and a 
personal pronoun So, the linear combination of 
these elements allows six different analyses 
However, m sentences hke 
Ela compra-o  hoje (She buys it today) 
compra Is only a verb, and o is only a personal 
pronoun, bound to the verb by an hyphen 
The following FST 
Fig 4 - FST for the dlsamblguanon of
verbs and clmcs 
was built to solve these amb~gmttes the five 
erroneous analyses are not taken mto account, 
compra and o receive the correct ags 
3.3 Numer ica l  Determiners 
The Portuguese numerical determiners from dots 
(2) to novecentos e noventa e nove md novecentos 
e noventa e nove (999,999) are plural forms 
However, some of them can reflect m gender 
dol_.~s <hvro__s> 
(two <books>) 
du_a~s <cadeira_.ss> 
(two <chmrs>) 
trezentos e vmte e dots <hvro__~s> 
(three hundred and twenty-two <books>) 
trezenta___~s e vmte e duas <cadetra_._s_s> 
(three hundred and twenty-two <chmrs>) 
~ That ~s the case of aqueloutra which Is the 
contraction of the demonstrative pronouns aquela + 
outra (that(fs) + otherOes)) In Portuguese, ven though 
contracted words are numerous, the hst of contractions 
~s stdl a closed set So its descnpuon with FSTs is 
possible However, this solution would not be adequate 
to describe productive phenomena revolving 
agglutination, as it is probably the case of most 
compound nouns In German, for instance 
Others are mvanant an respect to gender 
vinte <hvros> 
(twenty <books>) 
vtnte <cadeiras> 
(twenty <chairs>) 
rail e sete <hvros> 
(one hundred and seven <books>) 
mde sete <cadeiras> 
(one hundred and seven <chmrs>) 
Numerical deternuners uch as dots, duas and 
vmte are simple words and therefore they are 
formahzed tn the DELAF dicnonary, numerical 
deterrnmers uch as trezentos e vmte e dots, 
trezentas e vinte e duas and mt le  sete can be seen 
as specml compound words that are more 
adequately described by FST

for instance, CentenasMF refers to the sub-graph 
that represents all mvanant compound 
determiners from cento e tr~s (103) to cento e 
noventa e nove (199) and UmdadesMF represents 
all mvanant umts from tr~s (3) to nove (9) 
4 Parsing Texts Using INTEX Tools 
The hngmstlc resources that we briefly described 
have been imported into INTEX, that apply them 
to large texts We gave here some examples of text 
processing, using a small text 
a) Recognttton of all compound words of the text

adjectave m pre-nomlnal posmon or a 
preposmonal phrase (PREP N) In the first 
paragraph of the sample text, the NPs 
corresponding to those structures are (underhned)

verbs dever, poder (must, can) The mare verbs

they have good prospects to survtve) must be

s~mple words, but they represent compounds Our 
expenment of braiding such dlcuonanes indicates 
that the assocmtlon of both types of lexlcal umts tt 
~s not a tnvml task 
5.2 Compound nouns  
The d~cuonanes of compound nouns are being 
enlarged m a seml-automatlc way We write 
regular expressions that correspond to typical 
patterns of compound nouns (e g <N ms> <A 
ms>), and then we ask INTEX to extract from 
texts (to which dicnonanes have been apphed 
prewously) all patterns that match that structure 
The resulting hsts, integrated into a concordance, 
contain not only the combinations of a noun and 
an adjecuve but also compound nouns of that 
form that are followed by an adjective Lmgmsts 
mteracttvely validate the hsts of candidates to 
binary or ternary compounds
