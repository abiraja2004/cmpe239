Abstract 
This paper describes a method of comparing 
corpora which uses frequency profiling. The 
method can be used to discover key words in 
the corpora which differentiate one corpus 
from another. Using annotated corpora, it 
can be applied to discover key grammatical 
or word-sense categories. This can be used 
as a quick way in to find the differences 
between the corpora and is shown to have 
applications in the study of social 
differentiation in the use of English 
vocabulary, profiling of learner English and 
document analysis in the software 
engineering process. 
1 Introduct ion 
Corpus-based techniques have increasingly been 
used to compare language usage in recent years. 
One of the largest early studies was the 
comparison of one million words of American 
English (the Brown corpus) with one million 
words of British English (the LOB corpus) by 
Hofland and Johansson (1982). A difference 
coefficient defined by Yule (1944) showed the 
relative frequency of a word in the two corpora. 
A statistical goodness-of-fit test, the Chi-squared 
test, was also used to compare word frequencies 
across the two corpora. They noted any resulting 
chi-squared values which indicated that a 
statistically significant difference at the 5%, 1%, 
or 0.1% level had been detected between the 
frequency of a word in American English and in 
British English. The null hypothesis of the test is 
that there is no difference between the observed 
frequencies. 
More recently, this size of corpus comparison 
is becoming the standard even for postgraduate 
studies with the increasing availability of 
corpora and reasoning that one million words 
gives sufficient evidence for higher frequency 
words. However, with the production of large 
corpora such as the British National Corpus 
(BNC) containing one hundred million words 
(Aston & Burnard, 1998), frequency 
comparisons are available across millions of 
words of text. There are two main types of 
corpus comparison: 
? comparison of a sample corpus to a large(r) 
corpus 
? comparison of two (roughly-) equal sized 
corpora 
In the first type, we refer to the large(r) corpus 
as a horrnative' corpus since it provides a text 
norm (or standard) against which we can 
compare. These two main types of comparison 
can be extended to the comparison of more than 
two corpora. For example, we may compare one 
normative corpus to several smaller corpora at 
the same time, or compare three or more equal 
sized corpora to each other. In general, however, 
this makes the results more difficult o interpret. 
There are also a number of issues which need 
to be considered when comparing two (or more) 
corpora: 
? representativeness 
? homogeneity within the corpora 
? comparability ofthe corpora 
? reliability of statsfical tests (for different sized 
corpora nd other factors) 
Representativeness (Biber, 1993) is a 
particularly important attribute for a normative 
corpus when comparing a sample corpus to a 
large normative corpus (such as the BNC) which 
contains ections from many different text types 
and domains. To be representative a corpus 
should contain samples of  all major text types 
(Leech, 1993) and if possible in some way 
proportional to their usage in ~very day 
language' (Clear, 1992). This first type of 
comparison is intended to discow~r features in 
the sample corpus with significantly different 
usage (i.e. frequency) to that found in ~eneral' 
language. 
The second type of comparison is one that 
views corpora as equals (as in the Brown and 
LOB comparison). It aims to discover features in 
the corpora that distinguish one tiom another. 
Homogeneity within each of the corpora is 
important here since we may find that the results 
reflect sections within one of the corpora which 
are unlike other sections in either of the corpora 
under consideration (Kilgarriff 1997). 
Comparability is of interest too, since the 
corpora should have been sampled for in the 
same way. In other words, the corpora should 
have been built using the same stratified 
sampling method and with, if  possible, 
randornised methods of sample selection. This is 
the case with Brown and LOB, since LOB was 
designed to be comparable tothe Brown corpus. 
The final issue, which has been addressed 
elsewhere, is the one regarding the reliability of 
the statistical tests in relation to the size of the 
corpora under consideration. Kilgarriff (1996) 
points out that in the Brown versus LOB 
comparison many eomrnon words are marked as 
having significant chi-squared values, and that 
because words are not selected at random in 
language we will always see a large number of 
differences in two such text collections. He 
selects the Mann-Whitney test that: uses ranks of 
frequency data rather than the frequency values 
themselves tocompute the statistic. However, he 
observes that even with the new test 60% of 
words are marked as significant. Ignoring the 
actual frequency of occurrence as in the Mann- 
Whitney test discards most of the evidence we 
have about he distribution of  words. The test is 
often used when comparing ordinal rating scales 
(Oakes 1998: 17). 
Dunning (1993) reports that we should not rely 
on the assumption of a normal distribution when 
performing statistical text analysis and suggests 
that parametric analysis based on the binomial or 
multinomial distributions i  a better alternative 
for smaller texts. The chi-squared value becomes 
unreliable when the expected frequency is less 
than 5 and possibly overestimates with high 
frequency words and when comparing a 
relatively small corpus to a much larger one. He 
proposes the log-likelihood ratio as an 
alternative to Pearson~ chi-squared test. For this 
reason, we chose to use the log-likelihood ratio 
in our work as described in the next section. In 
fact, Cressie and Read (1984) show that 
Pearson~ X 2 (chi-squared) and the likelihood 
ratio G 2 (Dunning~ log-likelihood) are two 
statistics in a continuum defined by the power- 
divergence family of statistics. They go on to 
describe this family in later work (1988, 1989) 
where they also make reference to the long and 
continuing discussion of the normal and chi- 
squared approximations for X 2 and G 2. 
We have applied the goodness-of-fit test for 
comparison of linguistically annotated corpora. 
The frequency distributions of part-of-speech 
and semantic tags are sharply different to words. 
In these comparisons, we are unlikely to observe 
rare events such as tags occurring once. 
However, much higher frequencies will occur 
and so the log-likelihood test is less likely to 
overestimate significance in these cases. 
2 Methodology 
The method is fairly simple and straightforward 
to apply. Given two corpora we wish to 
compare, we produce a frequency list for each 
corpus. Normally, this would be a word 
frequency list, but as described above and as 
with examples in the following application 
section, it can be a part-of-speech (POS) or 
semantic tag frequency list. However, let us 
assume for now that we are performing a 
comparison at the word levee For each word in 
the two frequency lists we calculate the log- 
likelihood (henceforth LL) statistic. This is 
performed by constructing a contingency table 
as in Table 1. 
i The application of this technique to POS or 
semantic tag frequency lists is achieved by 
constructing the contingency table with tag rather 
than word frequencies. 
Table 1 Contigency table for word frequencies 
CORPUS CORPUS TOTAL 
ONE TWO 
Freq a b a+b 
of word 
Freq c-a d-b c+d-a-b 
of other 
words 
TOTAL c d c+d 
Note that the value ~' corresponds to the 
number of words in corpus one, and ~' 
corresponds to the number of words in corpus 
two (1'4 values). The values ~' and b'are called 
the observed values (O). We need to calculate 
the expected values (E) according to the 
following formula: 
E i = 
i 
i 
In our case N1 = c, and N2 = d. So, for this 
word, E1 = c*(a+b) / (c+d) and E2 = d*(a+b) /
(c+d). The calculation for the expected values 
takes account of the size of the two corpora, so 
we do not need to normalise the figures before 
applying the formula. We can then calculate the 
log-likehood value according to this formula: 
-21n A = 2~ Oi In~-~ 
This equates to calculating LL as follows: 
LL = 2*((a*log (a/E1)) + (b*log (b/E2))) 
The word frequency list is then sorted by the 
resulting LL values. This gives the effect of 
placing the largest LL value at the top of the list 
representing the word which has the most 
significant relative frequency difference between 
the two corpora. In this way, we can see the 
words most indicative (or characteristic) of one 
corpus, as compared to the other corpus, at the 
top of the list. The words which appear with 
roughly similar relative frequencies in the two 
corpora ppear lower down the list. Note that we 
do not use the hypothesis-test by comparing the 
LL values to a chi-squared distribution table. As 
Kilgarriff & Rose (1998) note, even Pearson~ 
X 2 is suitable without the hypothesis-testing 
link: Given the non-random nature of words in 
a text, we are always likely to find frequencies 
of words which differ across any two texts, and 
the higher the frequencies, the more information 
the statistical test has to work with. Hence, it is 
at this point that the researcher must intervene 
and qualitatively examine examples of the 
significant words highlighted by this technique. 
We are not proposing a completely automated 
approach. 
3 Applications 
This method has already been applied to study 
social differentiation in the use of English 
vocabulary and profiling of learner English. In 
Rayson et al(1997), selective quantitative 
analyses of the demographically sampled spoken 
English component of the BNC were carried out. 
This is a subcorpus of circa 4.5 million words, in 
which speakers and respondents are identified 
by such factors as gender, age, social group and 
geographical region. Using the method, a 
comparison was performed of the vocabulary of 
speakers, highlighting those differences which 
are marked by a very high value of significant 
difference between different sectors of the 
corpus according to gender, age and social 
group. 
In Granger and Rayson (1998), two similar- 
sized corpora of native and non-native writing 
were compared at the lexical level. The corpora 
were analysed by a part-of-speech tagger, and 
this permitted a comparison at the major word- 
class level. The patterns of significant overuse 
and underuse for POS categories demonstrated 
that the learner data displayed many of the 
stylistic features of spoken rather than written 
English. 
The same technique has more recently been 
applied to compare corpora analysed at the 
semantic level in a systems engineering domain 
and this is the main focus of this section. The 
motivation for this work is that despite natural 
language's well-documented shortcomings as a 
medium for precise technical description, its use 
in software-intensive systems engineering 
remains inescapable. This poses many problems 
for engineers who must derive problem 
understanding and synthesise precise solution 
descriptions from free text. This is true both for 
the largely unstructured textual descriptions 
from which system requirements are derived, 
and for more formal documents, such as 
standards, which impose requirements on system 
development processes. We describe an 
experiment that has been carried out in the 
REVERE project (Rayson et al 2000) to 
investigate the use of probabilistic natural 
language processing techniques to provide 
systems engineering support. 
The target documents are field reports of a 
series of ethnographic studies at an air traffic 
conlxol (ATC) centre. This formed part of a 
study of ATC as an example of a system that 
supports collaborative user tasks (Bentley et al 
1992). The documents consist of both the 
verbatim transcripts of the ethnographerb 
observations and interviews with controllers, 
and of reports compiled by the ethnographer for 
later analysis by a multi-disciplinary team of 
social scientists and systems engineers. The field 
reports form an interesting study because they 
exhibit many characteristics typical of 
documents een by a systems engineer. The 
volume of the information is fairly high (103 
pages) and the documents are not structured in a 
way designed to help the extraction of 
requirements ( ay around business processes or 
system architecture). 
The text is analysed by a part-of-speech tagger, 
CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997), and a 
semantic analyser (Rayson and Wilson, 1996) 
which assigns semantic tags that represent the 
semantic field (word-sense) of words from a 
lexicon of single words and an idiom list of 
multi-word combinations (e.g. ~ a rule). These 
resources contain approximately 52,000 words 
and idioms. 
The normative corpus that we used was a 2.3 
million-word subset of the BNC derived from 
the transcripts of spoken English. Using this 
.corpus, the most over-represented sernanfie 
categories in the ATC field reports are shown in 
Table 2. The log-likelihood test is applied as 
described in the previous ection and represents 
the semantic tag's frequency deviation from the 
normative corpus. The higher the figure, the 
greater the deviation.

With the exception of Y I (an anomaly caused 
by an interviewees initials being mistaken for 
the PH unit of acidity), all of these semantic 
categories include important objects, roles, 
functions, etc. in the ATC domain. The 
frequency with which some of these occur, such 
as M5 (flying), are uusurprising. Others are 
more revealing about the domain of ATC. 
Figure 1 shows some of the occurrences of the 
semantic category 02 (general objects). The 
important information extracted here is the 
importance of Mrips' (formally, 1light strips). 
These are small pieces of cardboard with printed 
flight details that are the most fundamental 
artefact used by the air traffic controllers to 
manage their air space. Examination of other 
words in this category also shows that flight

strips are held in tacks' to organise them 
according to (for example) aircraft time-of- 
arrival. 
Similarly, browsing the context for Q1.2 
(paper documents and writing) would allow us 
to discover that controllers annotate flight strips 
'to record deviations from flight plans, and L1 
(life, living things) would reveal that some strips 
are live; that is, they refer to aircraft currently 
traversing the contxoller's sector. Notice also that 
the semantic categories' deviation from the 
normative corpus can also be expected to reveal 
domain roles (actors). In this example, the 
frequency of $7.1 (power, organising) shows the 
importance of the roles of ~ontrollers' and 
~hiefs'. 
Using the frequency profiling method does not 
automate the task of identifying abstractions, 
much less does it produce fully formed 
requirements that can be pasted into a 
specification document. Instead, it helps the 
engineer quickly isolate potentially significant 
domain abstractions that require closer analysis. 
4 Conclusions 
reliability of the statistical tests (LL, Pearson~ 
X 2 and others) under the effects of corpus size, 
ratio of the corpora being compared and word 
(or tag) frequency. 
We do not propose a completely automated 
approach. The tools suggest a group of key items 
by decreasing order of significance which 
distinguish one corpus from another. It is then 
that the researcher should investigate 
occurrences of the significant items in the 
corpora using standard corpus techniques uch 
as KWIC (key-word in context). The reasons 
behind their significance can be discovered and 
explanations ought for the patterns displayed. 
By this process, we can compare the corpora 
under investigation and make hypotheses about 
the language use that they represent.
