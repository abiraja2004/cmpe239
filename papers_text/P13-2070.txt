Abstract
Machine Transliteration is an essential
task for many NLP applications. Howev-
er, names and loan words typically orig-
inate from various languages, obey dif-
ferent transliteration rules, and therefore
may benefit from being modeled inde-
pendently. Recently, transliteration mod-
els based on Bayesian learning have over-
come issues with over-fitting allowing for
many-to-many alignment in the training of
transliteration models. We propose a nov-
el coupled Dirichlet process mixture mod-
el (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters
and bilingually aligns transliteration data
within a single unified model. The un-
ified model decomposes into two class-
es of non-parametric Bayesian component
models: a Dirichlet process mixture mod-
el for clustering, and a set of multino-
mial Dirichlet process models that perf-
orm bilingual alignment independently for
each cluster. The experimental results
show that our method considerably outper-
forms conventional alignment models.
1 Introduction
Machine transliteration methods can be catego-
rized into phonetic-based models (Knight et al,
1998), spelling-based models (Brill et al, 2000),
and hybrid models which utilize both phonetic
and spelling information (Oh et al, 2005; Oh et
al., 2006). Among them, statistical spelling-based
models which directly align characters in the train-
ing corpus have become popular because they
are language-independent, do not require phonet-
ic knowledge, and are capable of achieving state-
of-the-art performance (Zhang et al, 2012b). A
major problem with real-word transliteration cor-
pora is that they are usually not clean, may con-
tain name pairs with various linguistic origins and
this can hinder the performance of spelling-based
models because names from different origins obey
different pronunciation rules, for example:
?Kim Jong-il/???? (Korea),
?Kana Gaski/??? (Japan),
?Haw King/??? (England),
?Jin yong/??? (China).
The same Chinese character ??? should be
aligned to different romanized character se-
quences: ?Kim?, ?Kana?, ?King?, ?Jin?. To ad-
dress this issue, many name classification metho-
ds have been proposed, such as the supervised lan-
guage model-based approach of (Li et al, 2007),
and the unsupervised approach of (Huang et al,
2005) that used a bottom-up clustering algorithm.
(Li et al, 2007) proposed a supervised translitera-
tion model which classifies names based on their
origins and genders using a language model; it
switches between transliteration models based on
the input. (Hagiwara et al, 2011) tackled the is-
sue by using an unsupervised method based on the
EM algorithm to perform a soft classification.
Recently, non-parametric Bayesian
models (Finch et al, 2010; Huang et al,
2011; Hagiwara et al, 2012) have attracted
much attention in the transliteration field. In
comparison to many of the previous alignment
models (Li et al, 2004; Jiampojamarn et al,
2007; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al, 2011), the non-
parametric Bayesian models allow unconstrained
monotonic many-to-many alignment and are able
to overcome the inherent over-fitting problem.
Until now most of the previous work (Li et al,
2007; Hagiwara et al, 2011) is either affected by
the multi-origins factor, or has issues with over-
fitting. (Hagiwara et al, 2012) took these two fac-
tors into consideration, but their approach still op-
erates within an EM framework and model order
selection by hand is necessary prior to training.
393
We propose a simple, elegant, fully-
unsupervised solution based on a single generative
model able to both cluster and align simultaneous-
ly. The coupled Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
(cDPMM) integrates a Dirichlet process mixture
model (DPMM) (Antoniak, 1974) and a Bayesian
Bilingual Alignment Model (BBAM) (Finch et
al., 2010). The two component models work
synergistically to support one another: the clus-
tering model sorts the data into classes so that
self-consistent alignment models can be built
using data of the same type, and at the same time
the alignment probabilities from the alignment
models drive the clustering process.
In summary, the key advantages of our model
are as follows:
? it is based on a single, unified generative
model;
? it is fully unsupervised;
? it is an infinite mixture model, and does not
require model order selection ? it is effec-
tively capable of discovering an appropriate
number of clusters from the data;
? it is able to handle data from multiple origins;
? it can perform many-to-many alignment
without over-fitting.
2 Model Description
In this section we describe the methodology and
realization of the proposed cDPMM in detail.
2.1 Terminology
In this paper, we concentrate on the alignment
process for transliteration. The proposed cDP-
MM segments a bilingual corpus of transliteration
pairs into bilingual character sequence-pairs. We
will call these sequence-pairs Transliteration U-
nits (TUs). We denote the source and target of
a TU as sm1 = ?s1, ..., sm? and tn1 = ?t1, ..., tn?
respectively, where si (ti) is a single character in
source (target) language. We use the same no-
tation (s, t) = (?s1, ..., sm?, ?t1, ..., tn?) to de-
note a transliteration pair, which we can write as
x = (sm1 , tn1 ) for simplicity. Finally, we express
the training set itself as a set of sequence pairs:
D = {xi}Ii=1. Our aim is to obtain a bilingual
alignment ?(s1, t1), ..., (sl, tl)? for each transliter-
ation pair xi, where each (sj , tj) is a segment of
the whole pair (a TU) and l is the number of seg-
ments used to segment xi.
2.2 Methodology
Our cDPMM integrates two Dirichlet process
models: the DPMM clustering model, and the
BBAM alignment model which is a multinomial
Dirichlet process.
A Dirichlet process mixture model, models the
data as a mixture of distributions ? one for each
cluster. It is an infinite mixture model, and the
number of components is not fixed prior to train-
ing. Equation 1 expresses the DPMM hierarchi-
cally.
Gc|?c, G0c ? DP (?c, G0c)
?k|Gc ? Gc
xi|?k ? f(xi|?k) (1)
where G0c is the base measure and ?c > 0 is the
concentration parameter for the distribution Gc.
xi is a name pair in training data, and ?k repre-
sents the parameters of a candidate cluster k for
xi. Specifically ?k contains the probabilities of all
the TUs in cluster k. f(xi|?k) (defined in Equa-
tion 7) is the probability that mixture component
k parameterized by ?k will generate xi.
The alignment component of our cDPMM is
a multinomial Dirichlet process and is defined as
follows:
Ga|?a, G0a ? DP (?a, G0a)
(sj , tj)|Ga ? Ga (2)
The subscripts ?c? and ?a? in Equations 1 and 2
indicate whether the terms belong to the clustering
or alignment model respectively.
The generative story for the cDPMM is sim-
ple: first generate an infinite number of clusters,
choose one, then generate a transliteration pair us-
ing the parameters that describe the cluster. The
basic sampling unit of the cDPMM for the cluster-
ing process is a transliteration pair, but the basic
sampling unit for BBAM is a TU. In order to inte-
grate the two processes in a single model we treat
a transliteration pair as a sequence of TUs gener-
ated by a BBAM model. The BBAM generates a
sequence (a transliteration pair) based on the joint
source-channel model (Li et al, 2004). We use a
blocked version of a Gibbs sampler to train each
BBAM (see (Mochihashi et al, 2009) for details
of this process).
2.3 The Alignment Model
This model is a multinomial DP model. Under the
Chinese restaurant process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985)
394
interpretation, each unique TU corresponds to a
dish served at a table, and the number of customers
in each table represents the count of a particular
TU in the model.
The probability of generating the jth TU (sj , tj)
is,
P
(
(sj , tj)|(s?j , t?j)
)
=
N
(
(sj , tj)
)
+ ?aG0a
(
(sj , tj)
)
N + ?a (3)
where N is the total number of TUs generated
so far, and N
(
(sj , tj)
)
is the count of (sj , tj).
(s?j , t?j) are all the TUs generated so far except
(sj , tj). The base measure G0a is a joint spelling
model:
G0a
(
(s, t)
)
= P (|s|)P (s||s|)P (|t|)P (t||t|)
= ?
|s|
s
|s|! e
??sv?|s|s ?
?|t|t
|t|! e
??tv?|t|t
(4)
where |s| (|t|) is the length of the source (target)
sequence, vs (vt) is the vocabulary (alphabet) size
of the source (target) language, and ?s (?t) is the
expected length of source (target) side.
2.4 The Clustering Model
This model is a DPMM. Under the CRP interpre-
tation, a transliteration pair corresponds to a cus-
tomer, the dish served on each table corresponds
to an origin of names.
We use z = (z1, ..., zI), zi ? {1, ...,K} to in-
dicate the cluster of each transliteration pair xi in
the training set and ? = (?1, ..., ?K) to represent
the parameters of the component associated with
each cluster.
In our model, each mixture component is a
multinomial DP model, and since ?k contains the
probabilities of all the TUs in cluster k, the num-
ber of parameters in each ?k is uncertain and
changes with the transliteration pairs that belong
to the cluster. For a new cluster (the K + 1th clus-
ter), we use Equation 4 to calculate the probability
of each TU. The cluster membership probability
of a transliteration pair xi is calculated as follows,
P (zi = k|D, ?, z?i) ? nkn? 1 + ?c
P (xi|z, ?k) (5)
P (zi = K + 1|D, ?, z?i) ? ?cn? 1 + ?c
P (xi|z, ?K+1)
(6)
where nk is the number of transliteration pairs in
the existing cluster k ? {1, ...,K} (cluster K + 1
is a newly created cluster), zi is the cluster indi-
cator for xi, and z?i is the sequence of observed
clusters up to xi. As mentioned earlier, basic sam-
pling units are inconsistent for the clustering and
alignment model, therefore to couple the models
the BBAM generates transliteration pairs as a se-
quence of TUs, these pairs are then used directly
in the DPMM.
Let ? = ?(s1, t1), ..., (sl, tl)? be a derivation of
a transliteration pair xi. To make the model inte-
gration process explicit, we use function f to cal-
culate the probability P (xi|z, ?k), where f is de-
fined as follows,
f(xi|?k) =
{ ?
??R
?
(s,t)?? P (s, t|?k) k ? {1, ...,K}?
??R
?
(s,t)?? G0c(s, t) k = K + 1
(7)
where R denotes the set of all derivations of xi,
G0c is the same as Equation 4.
The cluster membership zi is sampled together
with the derivation ? in a single step according to
P (zi = k|D, ?, z?i) and f(xi|?k). Following the
method of (Mochihashi et al, 2009), first f(xi|?k)
is calculated by forward filtering, and then a sam-
ple ? is taken by backward sampling.
3 Experiments
3.1 Corpora
To empirically validate our approach, we investi-
gate the effectiveness of our model by conduct-
ing English-Chinese name transliteration genera-
tion on three corpora containing name pairs of
varying degrees of mixed origin. The first two cor-
pora were drawn from the ?Names of The World?s
Peoples? dictionary published by Xin Hua Pub-
lishing House. The first corpus was construct-
ed with names only originating from English lan-
guage (EO), and the second with names originat-
ing from English, Chinese, Japanese evenly (ECJ-
O). The third corpus was created by extracting
name pairs from LDC (Linguistic Data Consor-
tium) Named Entity List, which contains names
from all over the world (Multi-O). We divided the
datasets into training, development and test sets
for each corpus with a ratio of 10:1:1. The details
of the division are displayed in Table 2.

3.2 Baselines
We compare our alignment model with
GIZA++ (Och et al, 2003) and the Bayesian
bilingual alignment model (BBAM). We employ
two decoding models: a phrase-based machine
translation decoder (specifically Moses (Koehn
et al, 2007)), and the DirecTL decoder (Jiampo-
jamarn et al, 2009). They are based on different
decoding strategies and optimization targets, and
therefore make the comparison more compre-
hensive. For the Moses decoder, we applied the
grow-diag-final-and heuristic algorithm to extract
the phrase table, and tuned the parameters using
the BLEU metric.

Table 2: Statistics of the experimental corpora.
To evaluate the experimental results, we uti-
lized 3 metrics from the Named Entities Workshop
(NEWS) (Zhang et al, 2012a): word accuracy in
top-1 (ACC), fuzziness in top-1 (Mean F-score)
and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
3.3 Parameter Setting
In our model, there are several important parame-
ters: 1) max s, the maximum length of the source
sequences of the alignment tokens; 2) max t, the
maximum length of the target sequences of the
alignment tokens; and 3) nc, the initial number of
classes for the training data. We set max s = 6,
max t = 1 and nc = 5 empirically based on a
small pilot experiment. The Moses decoder was
used with default settings except for the distortion-
limit which was set to 0 to ensure monotonic de-
coding. For the DirecTL decoder the following
settings were used: cs = 4, ng = 9 and nBest =
5. cs denotes the size of context window for fea-
tures, ng indicates the size of n-gram features and
nBest is the size of transliteration candidate list
for updating the model in each iteration. The con-
centration parameter ?c, ?a of the clustering mod-
el and the BBAM was learned by sampling its val-
ue. Following (Blunsom et al, 2009) we used
a vague gamma prior ?(10?4, 104), and sampled
new values from a log-normal distribution whose
mean was the value of the parameter, and variance
was 0.3. We used the Metropolis-Hastings algo-
rithm to determine whether this new sample would
be accepted. The parameters ?s and ?t in Equa-
tion 4 were set to ?s = 4 and ?t = 1.

3.4 Experimental Results
Table 3 shows some details of the alignment re-
sults. The #(Clusters) represents the average num-
ber of clusters from the cDPMM. It is averaged
over the final 50 iterations, and the classes which
contain less than 10 name pairs are excluded. The
#(Targets) represents the average number of En-
glish character sequences that are aligned to each
Chinese sequence. From the results we can see
that in terms of the number of alignment targe-
ts: GIZA++ > cDPMM > BBAM. GIZA++ has
considerably more targets than the other approach-
es, and this is likely to be a symptom of it over-
fitting the data. cDPMM can alleviate the over-
fitting through its BBAM component, and at the
same time effectively model the diversity in Chi-
nese character sequences caused by multi-origin.

the name pair; the symbol ? ? indicates a ?NUL-
L? alignment. We can see the Chinese characters
??(ding) ?(yi) ?(dong)? have different align-
ments in different origins, and that the cDPMM
has provided the correct alignments for them.
We used the sampled alignment from running
the BBAM and cDPMMmodels for 100 iterations,
and combined the alignment tables of each class
together. The experiments are therefore investigat-
ing whether the alignment has been meaningfully
improved by the clustering process. We would ex-
pect further gains from exploiting the class infor-
mation in the decoding process (as in (Li et al,
2007)), but this remains future research. The top-
10 transliteration candidates were used for testing.
The detailed experimental results are shown in Ta-
bles 4 and 5.
Our proposed model obtained the highest per-
formance on all three datasets for all evaluation
metrics by a considerable margin. Surprisingly,
for dataset EO although there is no multi-origin
factor, we still observed a respectable improve-
ment in every metric. This shows that although
names may have monolingual origin, there are hid-
den factors which can allow our model to succeed,
possibly related to gender or convention. Other
models based on supervised classification or clus-
tering with fixed classes may fail to capture these
characteristics.
To guarantee the reliability of the compara-
tive results, we performed significance testing
based on paired bootstrap resampling (Efron et al,
1993). We found all differences to be significant
(p < 0.05).

efits of our model are that it can handle data from
multiple origins, and model using many-to-many
alignment without over-fitting. The model oper-
ates by clustering the data into classes while si-
multaneously aligning it, and is able to discover
an appropriate number of classes from the data.
Our results show that our alignment model can im-
prove the performance of a transliteration gener-
ation system relative to two other state-of-the-art
aligners. Furthermore, the system produced gains
even on data of monolingual origin, where no ob-
vious clusters in the data were expected.
