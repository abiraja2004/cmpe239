Abstract
This paper describes a new method for cross-
lingual textual entailment (CLTE) detection
based on machine translation (MT). We use
sub-segment translations from different MT
systems available online as a source of cross-
lingual knowledge. In this work we describe
and evaluate different features derived from
these sub-segment translations, which are used
by a support vector machine classifier to detect
CLTEs. We presented this system to the Se-
mEval 2012 task 8 obtaining an accuracy up to
59.8% on the English?Spanish test set, the sec-
ond best performing approach in the contest.
1 Introduction
Cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) detec-
tion (Mehdad et al, 2010) is an extension of the
textual entailment (TE) detection (Dagan et al, 2006)
problem. TE detection consists of finding out, for
two text fragments T and H in the same language,
whether T entails H from a semantic point of view
or not. CLTE presents a similar problem, but with T
and H written in different languages.
During the last years, many authors have focused
on resolving TE detection, as solutions to this prob-
lem have proved to be useful in many natural lan-
guage processing tasks, such as question answer-
ing (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006) or machine trans-
lation (MT) (Mirkin et al, 2009; Pado? et al, 2009).
Therefore, CLTE may also be useful for related tasks
in which more than one language is involved, such
as cross-lingual question answering or cross-lingual
information retrieval. Although CLTE detection is
a relatively new problem, it has already been tack-
led. Mehdad et al (2010) propose to use machine
translation (MT) to translate H from LH , the lan-
guage of H , into LT , the language of T , and then use
any of the state-of-the-art TE approaches. In a later
work (Mehdad et al, 2011), the authors use MT, but
in a more elaborate way. They train a phrase-based
statistical MT (PBSMT) system (Koehn et al, 2003)
translating from LH to LT , and use the translation
table obtained as a by-product of the training process
to extract a set of features which are processed by a
support vector machine classifier (Theodoridis and
Koutroumbas, 2009, Sect. 3.7) to decide whether T
entails H or not. Castillo (2011) discusses another
machine learning approach in which the features are
obtained from semantic similarity measures based on
WordNet (Miller, 1995).
In this work we present a new approach to tackle
the problem of CLTE detection using a machine learn-
ing approach, partly inspired by that of Mehdad et
al. (2011). Our method uses MT as a source of infor-
mation to detect semantic relationships between T
and H . To do so, we firstly split both T and H into
all the possible sub-segments with lengths between 1
and L, the maximum length, measured in words. We
then translate the set of sub-segments from T into
LH , and vice versa, and collect all the sub-segment
pairs in a single set. We claim that when T -side
sub-segments match T and their corresponding H-
side sub-segments match H , this reveals a semantic
relationship between them, which can be used to de-
termine whether T entails H or not. Note that MT
is used as a black box, i.e. sub-segment translations
may be collected from any MT system, and that our
approach could even use any other sources of bilin-
gual sub-sentential information. It is even possible
to combine different MT systems as we do in our
experiments. This is a key point of our work, since
472
it uses MT in a more elaborate way than Mehdad et
al. (2010), and it does not depend on a specific MT
approach. Another important difference between this
work and that of Mehdad et al (2011) is the set of
features used for classification.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the method used to collect the MT informa-
tion and obtain the features; Section 3 explains the
experimental framework; Section 4 shows the results
obtained for the different features combination pro-
posed; the paper ends with concluding remarks.
2 Features from machine translation
Our approach uses MT as a black box to detect par-
allelisms between the text fragments T and H by
following these steps:
1. T is segmented in all possible sub-segments
tm+p?1m of length p with 1 ? p ? L and 1 ?
m ? |T | ? p + 1, where L is the maximum
sub-segment length allowed. Analogously, H is
segmented to get al the possible sub-segments
hn+q?1n of length q, with 1 ? q ? L and 1 ?
n ? |T | ? q + 1.
2. The sub-segments obtained from T are trans-
lated using all the available MT systems into
LH . Analogously, the sub-segments from H
are translated into LT , to generate a set of sub-
segment pairs (t, h).
3. Those pairs of sub-segments (t, h) such that t is
a sub-string of T and h is a sub-string of H are
annotated as sub-segment links.
Note that it could be possible to use statistical MT to
translate both T and H and then use word alignments
to obtain the sub-segment links. However, we use this
methodology to ensure that any kind of MT system
can be used by our approach. As a result of this
process, a sub-segment in T may be linked to more
than one sub-segment in H , and vice versa. Based
on these sub-segment links we have designed a set of
features which may be used by a classifier for CLTE.
2.1 Basic features [Bas]
We used a set of basic features to represent the infor-
mation from the sub-segment links between T and H ,
which are computed as the fraction of words in each
of them covered by linked sub-segments of length
l ? [1, L]. We define the feature function Fl(S),
applied on a text fragment S (either T or H) as:
Fl(S) = Cov(S, l)/|S|
where Cov(S, l) is a function which obtains the num-
ber of words in S covered by at least one sub-segment
of length l which is part of a sub-segment link. An
additional feature is computed to represent the total
proportion of words in each text fragment:
Ftotal(S) = Cov(S, ?)/|S|
where Cov(S, ?) is the same as Cov(S, l) but using
sub-segments of any length up to L. Ftotal(S) pro-
vide information about overlapping that Fl(S) can-
not grasp. For instance, if we have F1(T ) = 0.5 and
F2(T ) = 0.5, we cannot know if the sub-segments
of l = 1 and l = 2 are covering the same or different
words, so Ftotal(S) represents the actual proportion
of words covered in a text fragment S. These fea-
ture functions are applied both on T and H , thus
obtaining a set of 2 ? L+ 2 features, henceforth Bas.
2.2 Extensions to the basic features
Some extensions can be made to the basic features
defined above by using additional external resources.
In this section we propose two extensions.
Separate analysis of function words and content
words [Spl]. In this case, features represent, sepa-
rately, function words, with poor lexical information,
and content words, with richer lexical and seman-
tic information. In this way, Fl(S) is divided into
FFl(S) and CFl(S) defined as:
FFl(S) = CovF(S, l)/|FW(S)|
and
CFl(S) = CovC(S, l)/|CW(S)|
where FW(S) is a function that returns the func-
tion words in text fragment S and CW(S) per-
forms the same task for content words. Analogously,
CovF(S, l) and CovC(S, l) are versions of Cov(S, l)
which only consider function and content words, re-
spectively. This extension can be also be applied to
Ftotal(T ) and Ftotal(H). The set of 4L+ 4 features
obtained in this way (henceforth Spl) allows the clas-
sifier to use the information from the most relevant
words in T and H to detect entailment.
473
Stemming [Stm and SplStm]. Stemming can also
be used when detecting the sub-segment links. Both
the table of sub-segment pairs and the text fragment
pair (T ,H) are stemmed before matching. In this
way, conflicts of number or gender disagreement in
the translations can be overcome in order to detect
more sub-segment links. This new extension can
be applied both to Bas, obtaining the set of features
Stm, and to Spl, obtaining the set of features SplStm.
Although lemmatization could have been used, stem-
ming was preferred because it does not require the
part-of-speech ambiguity to be solved, which may
be difficult to solve when dealing with very short
sub-segments.
2.3 Additional features
Two additional features were defined unrelated with
the basic features proposed. The first one, called here
R, is the length ratio |T |/|H|. Intuitively we can
guess that if H is much longer than T it is unlikely
that T entails H .
The second additional set of features is the one
defined by Mehdad et al (2011), so we will refer to
it as M . The corresponding feature function com-
putes, for the total number of sub-segments of a given
length l ? [1, L] obtained from a text fragment S, the
fraction of them which appear in a sub-segment link.
It is applied both to H and T and is defined as:
F ?l (S) = Linkedl(S)/(|S| ? l + 1)
where Linkedl is the number of sub-segments from
S with length l which appear in a sub-segment link.
3 Experimental settings
The experiments designed for this task are aimed
at evaluating the features proposed in Section 2.
We evaluate our CLTE approach using the English?
Spanish data sets provided in the task 8 of SemEval
2012 (Negri et al, 2012).
Datasets. Two datasets were provided by the or-
ganization of SemEval 2012 (Negri et al, 2011): a
training set and a test set, both composed by a set
of 500 pairs of sentences. CLTE detection is evalu-
ated in both directions, so instances belong to one of
these four classes: forward (the sentence in Spanish
entails the one in English); backward (the sentence
in English entails the one in Spanish); bidirectional
(both sentences entail each other); and no entailment
(neither of the sentences entails each other).
For the whole data set, both sentences in each in-
stance were tokenized using the scripts1 included in
the Moses MT system (Koehn et al, 2007). Each sen-
tence was segmented to get al possible sub-segments
which were then translated into the other language.
External resources. We used three different MT
systems to translate the sub-segments from English
to Spanish, and vice versa:
? Apertium:2 a free/open-source platform for the
development of rule-based MT systems (For-
cada et al, 2011). We used the English?Spanish
MT system from the project?s repository3 (revi-
sion 34706).
? Google Translate:4 an online MT system by
Google Inc.
? Microsoft Translator:5 an online MT system by
Microsoft.
External resources were also used for the extended
features described in Section 2.2. We used the stem-
mer6 and the stopwords list provided by the SnowBall
project for Spanish7 and English.8
Classifier. We used the implementation of support
vector machine included in the WEKA v.3.6.6 data
mining software package (Hall et al, 2009) for multi-
class classification, and a polynomial kernel.
4 Results and discussion
We tried the different features proposed in Section 2
in isolation, and also different combinations of them.

tures described in Section 2 on the test set using

Nf is the number of features.
As can be seen, the features providing the best
results on accuracy are the SplStm features. In ad-
dition, results show that all versions of the basic
features (Bas, Spl, Stm, and SplStm) provide better
results than the M feature alone. Some combinations
of features are also reported in Table 1. Although
many combinations were tried, we only report the
results of the combinations of features performing
best because of lack of space.
As can be seen, both feature combinations Bas ?
Spl and Bas ? Stm obtain higher accuracy than the
separated features. Combining all these features
Bas ? Spl ? Stm ? SplStm provide even better re-
sults, thus confirming some degree of orthogonality
between them. Combination Bas ? Spl ?M ? R
obtains one of the best results, since it produces
an improvement of almost 1% over combination
Bas ? Spl ? Stm ? SplStm but using less than a
half of features. Combining all the features provides
the best accuracy as expected, so this seems to be the
best combination for the task.
Table 2 reports the results sent for the SemEval
2012 task 8. We chose feature combinations Bas ?
Spl?M ?R and Bas?Spl?Stm?SplStm?M ?
R since they are the best performing combinations.
We sent two runs of our method using all three MT
systems described in Section 3 and two more runs
using only sub-segment translations from Apertium.
From the ten teams presenting systems for the con-
test, only one overcomes our best result. Even the
results obtained using Apertium as the only MT sys-
tem overcome seven of the ten approaches presented.
This result confirms that state-of-the-art MT is a rich
source of information for CLTE detection.
5 Concluding remarks
In this paper we have described a new method for
CLTE detection which uses MT as a black-box source
of bilingual information. We experimented with dif-
ferent features which were evaluated with the datasets
for task 8 of SemEval 2012. We obtained up to 59.8%
of accuracy on the Spanish?English test set provided,
becoming the second best performing approach of
the contest. As future works, we are now preparing
experiments for other pairs of languages and we plan
to use weights to promote those translations coming
from more-reliable MT systems.
