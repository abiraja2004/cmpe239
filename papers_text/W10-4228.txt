Abstract
We describe our contribution to the Gen-
eration Challenge 2010 for the tasks
of Named Entity Recognition and co-
reference detection (GREC-NER). To ex-
tract the NE and the referring expressions,
we employ a combination of a Part of
Speech Tagger and the Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) learning technique. We
finally experiment an original algorithm
to detect co-references. We conclude
with discussion about our system perfor-
mances.
1 Introduction
Three submission tracks are proposed in Genera-
tion Challenges 2010. GREC-NEG, where partic-
ipating systems select a referring expression (RE)
from a given list. GREC-NER where partic-
ipating systems must recognize all mentions of
people in a text and identify which mentions co-
refer. And GREC-Full, end-to-end RE regener-
ation task; participating systems must identify all
mentions of people and then aim to generate im-
proved REs for the mentions. In this paper we
present an unsupervised CRF based Named Entity
Recognition (NER) system applied to the GREC-
NER Task.
2 System description
The proposed system follows a pipelined architec-
ture (each module processes the information pro-
vided by the previous one). First, a Part of Speech
(POS) tagger is applied to the corpus. Then, the
combination of words and POS tags are used by
a CRF classifier to detect Named Entities (NE).
Next, logical rules based on combination of POS
tags, words and NE labels are used to detect pro-
nouns related to persons. Finally, an algorithm

identifies, among the person entities that have
been detected, the ones that co-refer and cluster
them. At the end, all collected information is ag-
gregated in a XML file conform to GREC-NER
specifications.
2.1 Part of speech
The part of speech labeling is done with the En-
glish version of Treetagger1. It is completed by
a step where every NAM tag associated to a first
nname is replaced by a FNAME tag, using a lex-
ical resource of first names (see table 2, column
POS Tag). The first name tag improves the NE
detection model while it improves the estimation
of conditional probabilities for words describing a
person, encountered by a NER system.

2.2 Named entity and pronoun labeling
The Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
is an implementation of the CRF based system
(Be?chet and Charton, 2010) that has been used
in the French NER evaluation campaign ESTER
2 (Galliano et al, 2009)2. For the present task,
training of the NER tool is fully unsupervised as
it does not use the GREC training corpus. It is
trained in English with an automatically NE an-
notated version of the Wikipedia Corpus (the full
system configuration is described in (Charton and

ORG, LOC, TIME, DATE. We measured a spe-
cific precision of 0,93 on PERS NE detection ap-
plied to the English ACE4 evaluation set.
Following the NE detection process, detection
rules are used to label each personal pronoun with
the PERS tag. Boolean AND rules are applied
to triples {word, POS tag, NE tag}, where word
= {he, him, she, her ...}, POS tag=NN, and NE
tag=UNK . This rule structure is adopted to avoid
the PERS labeling of pronouns included in an ex-
pression or in a previously tagged NE (i.e a music
album or a movie title, using word She, and pre-
viously labeled with PROD NE tag). Finally, each
PERS labeled entity is numbered by order of ap-
parition and is associated with the sentences refer-
ence number where it appears (consecutive PERS
labeled words, not separated by punctuation mark,
receive the same index number).
2.3 Entities clustering by unstacking
In the final stage, our system determines which
entities co-refer. First, a clustering process is
achieved. The principle of the algorithm is as
follows: entities characteristics (words, POS tags,
sentence position) are indexed in a stack, ordered
according to their chronological apparition in the
text (the entity at the top of the stack is the first one
that has been detected in the document). At the
beginning of the process, the entity that is at the
top of the stack is removed and constitutes the first
item of a cluster. This entity is compared sequen-
tially, by using similarity rules, with every other
entities contained in the stack. When there is a
match, entity is transfered to the currently instan-
tiated cluster and removed from the stack. When
the end of the stack is reached, remaining entities
are reordered and the process iterates form the be-
ginning. This operation is repeated until the stack
is empty.
Comparison of entities in the stack is done in

two ways according to the nature of the entity.
We consider a candidate entity Ec from stack
S. According to iteration k, the current clus-
ter is Ck. Each element of the sequence Ec (i.e
Chester FNAME Carton NAM) is compared to the
sequences previously transfered in Ck during the
exploration process of the stack. If Ec ?

Ck, it
is included in cluster Ck and removed from S. Fi-
nally inclusion of pronouns from S in Ec is done
by resolving the anaphora, according to the Hobbs
algorithm, as described in (Jurafsky et al, 2000)5.
3 Results and conclusions
Table 1 shows our results on dev-set. We ob-
tain good precision on the 3 subsets. Our system
slightly underperforms the recall. This can be ex-
plained by a good performance in the NE detection
process, but a difficulty in some cases for the clus-
tering algorithm to group entities. We have ob-
served in the Inventors dev-set some difficulties,
due to strong variation of surface forms for spe-
cific entities. We plan to experiment the use of
an external resource of surface forms for person
names extracted from Wikipedia to improve our
system in such specific case.
