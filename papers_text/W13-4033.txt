Natural language interaction has the potential to considerably enhance
user experience, especially in mobile devices like smartphones and electronic
tablets. Recent advances in software integration and efforts toward more
personalization and context awareness have brought closer the long-standing
vision of the ubiquitous intelligent personal assistant. Multiple voice-driven
initiatives by a number of well-known companies have now reached commer-
cial deployment. In this talk, I will review the two major semantic interpreta-
tion frameworks underpinning virtual personal assistance, and reflect on the
inherent complementarity in their respective advantages and drawbacks. I
will then discuss some of the attendant choices made in the practical deploy-
ment of such systems, and speculate on their likely evolution going forward.
