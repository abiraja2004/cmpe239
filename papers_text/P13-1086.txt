Abstract
Semantic frames are a rich linguistic re-
source. There has been much work
on semantic frame parsers, but less that
applies them to general NLP problems.
We address a task to predict change in
stock price from financial news. Seman-
tic frames help to generalize from spe-
cific sentences to scenarios, and to de-
tect the (positive or negative) roles of spe-
cific companies. We introduce a novel tree
representation, and use it to train predic-
tive models with tree kernels using sup-
port vector machines. Our experiments
test multiple text representations on two
binary classification tasks, change of price
and polarity. Experiments show that fea-
tures derived from semantic frame pars-
ing have significantly better performance
across years on the polarity task.
1 Introduction
A growing literature evaluates the financial effects
of media on the market (Tetlock, 2007; Engel-
berg and Parsons, 2011). Recent work has applied
NLP techniques to various financial media (con-
ventional news, tweets) to detect sentiment in con-
ventional news (Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; Haider
and Mehrotra, 2011) or message boards (Chua
et al, 2009), or discriminate expert from non-
expert investors in financial tweets (Bar-Haim et
al., 2011). With the exception of Bar-Haim et al
(2011), these NLP studies have relied on small
corpora of hand-labeled data for training or evalu-
ation, and the connection to market events is done
indirectly through sentiment detection. We hy-
pothesize that conventional news can be used to
predict changes in the stock price of specific com-
panies, and that the semantic features that best
represent relevant aspects of the news vary across
On Wednesday, April 11th, 2012, Google Inc announced
its first
 quarterly earnings report, a week before the April20 options contracts expiration in contrast to its history
of reporting a day before monthly options expirations.
The stock price of Google surged 3.85% from April
10th?s $626.86 to 12th?s $651.01. On Friday, April 13th,
news reported Oracle Corp would sue
 Google Inc ,
claiming Google?s Android operating system tramples its intellectual property rights . Jury selection was set for
the next Monday. Google?s stock price tumbled 4.06% on
Friday, and continued to drop in the following week.

taining to Google in April, 2012.
market sectors. To test this hypothesis, we use
price information to label data from six years of
financial news. Our experiments test several doc-
ument representations for two binary classification
tasks, change of price and polarity. Our main con-
tribution is a novel tree representation based on
semantic frame parses that performs significantly
better than enriched bag-of-words vectors.
Figure 1 shows a constructed example based
on extracts from financial news about Google in
April, 2012. It illustrates how a series of events
reported in the news precedes and potentially
predicts a large change in Google?s stock price.
Google?s early announcement of quarterly earn-
ings possibly presages trouble, and its stock price
falls soon after reports of a legal action against
Google by Oracle. To produce a coherent story,
the original sentences were edited for Figure 1,
but they are in the style of actual sentences from
our dataset. Accurate detection of events and re-
lations that might have an impact on stock price
should benefit from document representation that
captures sentiment in lexical items (e.g., aggres-
sive) combined with the conceptual relations cap-
tured by FrameNet (Ruppenhofer and Rehbein,
2012). A frame is a lexical semantic representa-
873
tion of the conceptual roles played by parts of a
clause, and relates different lexical items (e.g., re-
port, announce) to the same situation type. In the
figure, some of the words that evoke frames have
been underlined, and role fillers are outlined by
boxes or ovals. Sentiment words are in italics.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is
the first to apply semantic frames in this do-
main. On the polarity task, the semantic frame fea-
tures encoded as trees perform significantly better
across years and sectors than bag-of-words vectors
(BOW), and outperform BOW vectors enhanced
with semantic frame features, and a supervised
topic modeling approach. The results on the price
change task show the same trend, but are not sta-
tistically significant, possibly due to the volatility
of the market in 2007 and the following several
years. Yet even modest predictive performance
on both tasks could have an impact, as discussed
below, if incorporated into financial models such
as Rydberg and Shephard (2003). We first dis-
cuss the motivation and related work. Section 4
presents vector-based and tree-based features from
semantic frame parses, and section 5 describes our
dataset. The experimental design and results ap-
pear in the following section, followed by discus-
sion and conclusions.
2 Motivation
Financial news is a rich vein for NLP applica-
tions to mine. Many news organizations that fea-
ture financial news, such as Reuters, the Wall
Street Journal and Bloomberg, devote significant
resources to the analysis of corporate news.
Much of the data that would support studies of
a link between the news media and the market are
publicly available. As pointed out by Tetlock et
al. (2008), linguistic communication is a poten-
tially important source of information about firms?
fundamental values. Because very few stock mar-
ket investors directly observe firms? production ac-
tivities, they get most of their information sec-
ondhand. Their three main sources are analysts?
forecasts, quantifiable publicly disclosed account-
ing variables, and descriptions of firms? current
and future profit-generating activities. If analyst
and accounting variables are incomplete or biased
measures of firms? fundamental values, linguis-
tic variables may have incremental explanatory
power for firms? future earnings and returns.
Consider the following sentences:
Oracle sued Google in August 2010, saying
Google?s Android mobile operating system in-
fringes its copyrights and patents for the Java pro-
gramming language. (a)
Oracle has accused Google of violating its in-
tellectual property rights to the Java programming
language. (b)
Oracle has blamed Google and alleged that the
latter has committed copyright infringement re-
lated to Java programming language held by Ora-
cle. (c)
Oracle?s Ellison says couldn?t sway Google on
Java. (d)
Sentences a, b and c are semantically similar,
but lexically rather distinct: the shared words are
the company names and Java (programming lan-
guage). Bag-of-Words (BOW) document repre-
sentation is difficult to surpass for many document
classification tasks, but cannot capture the de-
gree of semantic similarity among these sentences.
Methods that have proven successful for para-
phrase detection (Deerwester et al, 1990; Dolan
et al, 2004), as in the main clauses of b and
c, include latent variable models that simultane-
ously capture the semantics of words and sen-
tences, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) or
latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA). However, our
task goes beyond paraphrase detection. The first
three sentences all indicate an adversarial relation
of Oracle to Google involving a negative judge-
ment. It would be useful to capture the similarities
among all three of these sentences, and to distin-
guish the role of each company (who is suing and
who is being sued). Further, these three sentences
potentially have a greater impact on market per-
ception of Google in contrast to a sentence like d,
that refers to the same conflict more indirectly, and
whose main clause verb is say. We hypothesize
that semantic frames can address these issues.
Most of the NLP literature on semantic frames
addresses how to build robust semantic frame
parsers, with intrinsic evaluation against gold stan-
dard parses. There have been few applications of
semantic frame parsing for extrinsic tasks. To test
for measurable benefits of semantic frame parsing,
this paper poses the following questions:
1. Are semantic frames useful for document
representation of financial news?
2. What aspects of frames are most useful?
3. What is the relative performance of document
representation that relies on frames?
874
4. What improvements could be made to best
exploit semantic frames?
Our work is not aimed at investment profit.
Rather, we investigate whether computational lin-
guistic methodologies can improve our under-
standing of a company?s fundamental market
value, and whether linguistic information derived
from news produces a consistent enough result to
benefit more comprehensive financial models.
3 Related Work
NLP has recently been applied to financial text
for market analysis, primarily using bag-of-
words (BOW) document representation. Luss
and d?Aspremont (2008) use text classification to
model price movements of financial assets on a
per-day basis. They try to predict the direction
of return, and abnormal returns, defined as an ab-
solute return greater than a predefined threshold.
Kogan et al (2009) address a text regression prob-
lem to predict the financial risk of investment in
companies. They analyze 10-K reports to predict
stock return volatility. They also predict whether
a company will be delisted following its 10-K re-
port. Ruiz et al (2012) correlate text with finan-
cial time series volume and price data. They find
that graph centrality measures like page rank and
degree are more strongly correlated to both price
and traded volume for an aggregation of similar
companies, while individual stocks are less corre-
lated. Lavrenko et al (2000) present an approach
to identify news stories that influence the behavior
of financial markets, and predict trends in stock
prices based on the content of news stories that
precede the trends. Luss and d?Aspremont (2008)
and Lavrenko et al (2000) both point out the de-
sire for document feature engineering as future re-
search directions. We explore a rich feature space
that relies on frame semantic parsing.
Sentiment analysis figures strongly in NLP
work on news. General Inquirer (GI), a content
analysis program, is used to quantify pessimism of
news in Tetlock (2007) and Tetlock et al (2008).
Other resources for sentiment detection include
the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) to
score the prior polarity of words, as in Agarwal
et al (2011) on social media data. Our study in-
corporates DAL scores along with other features.
FrameNet is a rich lexical resource (Fillmore et
al., 2003), based on the theory of frame seman-
tics (Fillmore, 1976). There is active research

to build more accurate parsers (Das and Smith,
2011; Das and Smith, 2012). Semantic role label-
ing using FrameNet has been used to identify an
opinion with its holder and topic (Kim and Hovy,
2006). For deep representation of sentiment anal-
ysis, Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012) propose
SentiFrameNet.
Our work addresses classification tasks that
have potential relevance to an influential financial
model (Rydberg and Shephard, 2003). This model
decomposes stock price analysis of financial data
into a three-part ADS model - activity (a binary
process modeling the price move or not), direction
(another binary process modeling the direction of
the moves) and size (a number quantifying the size
of the moves). Our two binary classification tasks
for news, price change and polarity, are analogous
to their activity and direction. In contrast to the
ADS model, our approach does not calculate the
conditional probability of each factor. At present,
our goal is limited to the determination of whether
NLP features can uncover information from news
that could help predict stock price movement or
support analysts? investigations.
4 Methods
We propose two approaches for the use of seman-
tic frames. The first is a rich vector space based
on semantic frames, word forms and DAL affect
scores. The second is a tree representation that
encodes semantic frame features, and depends on
tree kernel measures for support vector machine
classification. The semantic parses of both meth-
ods are derived from SEMAFOR1 (Das and Smith,
2012; Das and Smith, 2011), which solves the se-
mantic parsing problem by rule-based target iden-
tification, log-linear model based frame identifica-
tion and frame element filling.

4.1 Semantic Frame based FWD Features
Table 1 lists 24 types of features, including seman-
tic Frame attributes, bag-of-Words, and scores for
words in the Dictionary of Affect in Language by
part of speech (pDAL). We refer to these features
as FWD features throughout the paper. FWD fea-
tures are used alone and in combinations.
FrameNet defines hundreds of frames, each of
which represents a scenario associated with se-
mantic roles, or frame elements, that serve as
participants in the scenario the frame signifies.
Table 2 shows two frames. The frame Judg-
ment communication (JC or Judgment comm. in
the rest of the paper) represents a scenario in
which a COMMUNICATOR communicates a judg-
ment of an EVALUEE for some REASON. It is
evoked by (target) words such as accuse or sue.
Here we use F for the frame name, FT for the
target words, and FE for frame elements. We use
both frequency and weighted scores. For exam-
ple, we define idf -adjusted weighted frame fea-
tures, such as wF for attribute F in document d as
wFF,d = f(F, d) ? log |D||d?D:F?d| , where f(F, d)is the frequency of frame F in d, D is the whole
document set and |?| is the cardinality operator.
Bag-of-Words features include term frequency
and tfidf of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
DAL (Dictionary of Affect in Language) is a
psycholinguistic resource to measure the emo-
tional meaning of words and texts (Whissel,
1989). It includes 8,742 words that were anno-
tated for three dimensions: Pleasantness (Pls), Ac-
tivation (Act), and Imagery (Img). Agarwal et
al. (2009) introduced part-of-speech specific DAL
features for sentiment analysis. We follow their
approach by averaging the scores for all words,
verb only, adjective only, and adverb only words.
Feature values are normalized to mean of zero and
standard deviation of one.
4.2 SemTree Feature Space and Kernels
We propose SemTree as another feature space to
encode semantic information in trees. SemTree
can distinguish the roles of each company of in-
terest, or designated object (e.g. who is suing and
who is being sued).
4.2.1 Construction of Tree Representation
The semantic frame parse of a sentence is a forest
of trees, each of which corresponds to a semantic
frame. SemTree encodes the original frame struc-
ture and its leaf words and phrases, and highlights
a designated object at a particular node as follows.
For each lexical item (target) that evokes a frame, a
backbone is found by extracting the path from the
root to the role filler mentioning a designated ob-
ject; the backbone is then reversed to promote the
designated object. If multiple frames have been
assigned to the same designated object, their back-
bones are merged. Lastly, the frame elements and
frame targets are inserted at the frame root.
The top of Figure 2 shows the semantic parse
for sentence a from section 2; we use it to illus-
trate tree construction for designated object Ora-
cle. The parse has two frames (Figure 2-(1)&(2)),
one corresponding to the main clause (verb sue),
and the other for the tenseless adjunct (verb say).
The reversed paths extracted from each frame root
to the designated object Oracle become the back-
bones (Figures 2-(3)&(4)). After merging the two
backbones we get the resulting SemTree, as shown
in Figure 2-(5). By the same steps, this sentence
would also yield a SemTree with Google at the
root, in the role of EVALUEE.
4.2.2 Kernels and Tree Substructures
The tree kernel (Moschitti, 2006; Collins and
Duffy, 2002) is a function of tree similarity, based
on common substructures (tree fragments). There
are two types of substructures. A subtree (ST) is
defined as any node of a tree along with all its de-
scendants. A subset tree (SST) is defined as any
node along with its immediate children and, op-
tionally, part or all of the children?s descendants.
Each tree is represented by a d dimensional vec-
tor where the i?th component counts the number
of occurrences of the i?th tree fragment.
Define the function hi(T ) as the number of
occurrences of the i?th tree fragment in tree
T , so that T is now represented as h(T ) =
(h1(T ), h2(T ), ..., hd(T )). We define the set of
nodes in tree T1 and T2 as NT1 and NT2 respec-
tively. We define the indicator function Ii(n) to be
1 if subtree i is seen rooted at node n, and 0 oth-
erwise. It follows that hi(T1) = ?n1?NT1 Ii(n1)

The kernel computational complexity is
O(|NT1 | ? |NT2 |), where all pairwise compar-
isons are carried out between T1 and T2. However,
there are fast algorithms for kernel computation
that run in linear time on average, either by
dynamic programming (Collins and Duffy, 2002),
or pre-sorting production rules before training
(Moschitti, 2006). We use the latter.
5 Dataset
We use publicly available financial news from
Reuters from January 2007 through August 2012.
This time frame includes a severe economic down-
turn in 2007-2010 followed by a modest recovery
in 2011-2012.
An information extraction pipeline is used to
pre-process the data. News full text is extracted
from HTML. The timestamp of the news is ex-
tracted for a later alignment with stock price infor-
mation, which will be discussed in section 6. The
company mentioned is identified by a rule-based
matching of a finite list of companies.
There are a total of 10 sectors in the Global In-
dustry Classification Standard (GICS), an industry
taxonomy used by the S&P 500.2 To explore our
approach for this domain, we select three sectors
for our experiment: Telecommunication Services
(TS, the sector with the smallest number of com-
panies), Information Technology (IT), and Con-
sumer Staples (CS), due to our familiarity with the
companies in these sectors and an expectation of
different characteristics they may exhibit. In the
expectation there would be semantic differences
associated with these sectors, experiments are per-
formed independently for each sector. There are
also differences in the number of companies in the
sector, and the amount of news.
We bin news articles by sector. We remove ar-
ticles that only list stock prices or only show ta-
bles of accounting reports. The first preprocess-
ing step is to extract sentences that mention the

relevant companies. Each data instance is a sen-
tence and one of the target companies it mentions.
Table 3 summarizes the data statistics. For exam-
ple, the consumer staples sector has 40 companies.
It has an average of 5,702 news articles (16,090
sentences) per year. Each sentence that mentions
a consumer staple company mentions 1.07 com-
panies on average. On average, this sector has
17,131 instances per year.
6 Experiments
Our current experiments are carried out for each
year, training on one year and testing on the next.
The choice to use a coarse time interval with no
overlap was an expedience to permit more numer-
ous exploratory experiments, given the computa-
tional resources these experiments require. We test
the influence of news to predict (1) a change in
stock price (change task), and (2) the polarity of
change (increase vs. decrease; polarity task). Ex-
periments evaluate the FWD and SemTree feature
spaces compared to two baselines: bag-of-words
(BOW) and supervised latent Dirichlet alocation
(sLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007). BOW in-
cludes features of unigram, bigram and trigram.
sLDA is a statistical model to classify documents
based on LDA topic models, using labeled data. It
has been applied to and shown good performance
in topical text classification, collaborative filter-
ing, and web page popularity prediction problems.
6.1 Labels, Evaluation Metrics, and Settings
We align publicly available daily stock price data
from Yahoo Finance with the Reuters news us-
ing a method to avoid back-casting. In particular,
we use the daily adjusted closing price - the price
quoted at the end of a trading day (4PM US East-
ern Time), then adjusted by dividends, stock split,
and other corporate actions. We create two types
of labels for news documents using the price data,
to label the existence of a change and the direc-
tion of change. Both tasks are treated as binary
classification problems. Based on the finding of
a one-day delay of the price response to the in-
formation embedded in the news by Tetlock et al
(2008), we use ?t = 1 in our experiment. To
constrain the number of parameters, we also use a
threshold value (r) of a 2% change, based on the
distribution of price changes across our data. In
future work, this could be tuned to sector or time.
change=
{
+1 if |pt(0)+?t?pt(?1)|pt(?1) > r
?1 otherwise
polarity=
{
+1 if pt(0)+?t > pt(?1) and change = +1
?1 if pt(0)+?t < pt(?1) and change = +1
pt(?1) is the adjusted closing price at the end of
the last trading day, and pt(0)+?t is the price of
the end of the trading day after the ?t day delay.
Only the instances with changes are included in
the polarity task.
There is high variance across years in the pro-
portion of positive labels, and often highly skewed
classes in one direction or the other. The average
ratios of +/- classes for change and polarity over
the six years? data are 0.73 (std=0.35) and 1.12
(std=0.25), respectively. Because the time frame
for our experiments includes an economic crisis
followed by a recovery period, we note that the
ratio between increase and decrease of price flips
between 2007, where it is 1.40, and 2008, where it
is 0.71. Accuracy is very sensitive to skew: when a
class has low frequency, accuracy can be high us-
ing a baseline that makes prediction on the major-
ity class. Given the high data skew, and the large
changes from year to year in positive versus nega-
tive skew, we use a more robust evaluation metric.
Our evaluation relies on the Matthews corre-
lation coefficient (MCC, also known as the ?-
coefficient) (Matthews, 1975) to avoid the bias of
accuracy due to data skew, and to produce a ro-
bust summary score independent of whether the
positive class is skewed to the majority or minor-
ity. In contrast to f-measure, which is a class-
specific weighted average of precision and recall,
and whose weighted version depends on a choice
of whether the class-specific weights should come
from the training or testing data, MCC is a sin-
gle summary value that incorporates all 4 cells of
a 2 ? 2 confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN and FN for
True or False Positive or Negative). We have also
observed that MCC has a lower relative standard
deviation than f-measure.
For a 2 ? 2 contingency table, MCC corre-
sponds to the square root of the average ?2 statis-
tic ??2/n, with values in [-1,1]. It has been sug-

All sentences with at least one company men-

stop words and use Stanford CoreNLP for part-
of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.
Models are constructed using linear kernel sup-
port vector machines for both classification tasks.
SVM-light with tree kernels3 (Joachims, 2006;
Moschitti, 2006) is used for both the FWD and
SemTree feature spaces.
6.2 Results
Table 4 shows the mean MCC values for each task,
for each sector. Separate means are shown for
the test years of financial crisis (2008-2010) and
economic recovery (2011-2012) to highlight the
differences in performance that might result from
market volatility.

SemTree combined with FWD (SemTreeFWD)
generally gives the best performance in both
change and polarity tasks. SemTree results here
are based on the subset tree (SST) kernel, be-
cause of its greater precision in computing com-
mon frame structures and consistently better per-
formance over the subtree (ST) kernel. SemTree
also provides interpretable features for manual
analysis as discussed in the next section.
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were per-
formed on the full 5 years for each sector, to com-
pare each feature representation as a predictor of
MCC score with the baseline BOW. The ANOVAs
yield the p-values shown in Table 4. There were no
significant differences from BOW on the change
task. For polarity detection, SemTreeFWD was
significantly better than BOW for each sector (see
boldface p-values). No other method was sig-
nificantly better than BOW, although FWD ap-
proaches significance on all sectors, and sLDA ap-
proaches significance on IT.
sLDA has promising MCC scores for the
telecommunication sector, which has only 8 com-
panies, thus many fewer data instances. Table 5
displays a sample of sLDA topics with good per-
formance on polarity for the consumer staples sec-
tor for training year 2009. The positive topics are
related to stock index details and retail data. The
negative topics contain many words with negative
sentiment (e.g., hurt, disappointing).
7 Discussion
7.1 Semantic Parse Quality
In general, SEMAFOR parses capture most of
the important frames for our purposes. There is,
however, significant room for improvement. On
a small, randomly selected sample of sentences
from all three sectors, two of the authors working
independently evaluated the semantic parses, with
approximately 80% agreement. Some of the in-
accuracies in frame parses result from errors prior
to the SEMAFOR parse, such as tokenization or

dependency parsing errors. The average sentence
length for the sample was 33.3 words, with an av-
erage of 14 frames per sentence, 3 of them with a
GICS company as a role filler. Because SemTree
encodes only the frames containing a designated
object (company), these are the frames we eval-
uated. On average, about half the frames with
a designated object were correct, and two thirds
of those frames we judged to be important. Be-
sides errors due to incorrect tokenization or depen-
dency parsing, we observed that about 8% to 10%
of frames were incorrectly assigned to due word
sense ambiguity.
7.2 Feature Analysis
The experimental results show the SemTree space
to be the one representation tested here that is sig-
nificantly better than BOW, but only for the po-
larity task. Post hoc analysis indicates this may
be due to the aptness of semantic frame parsing
for polarity. Limitations in our treatment of time
point to directions for improvement regarding the
change task.
Some strengths of our approach are the separate
treatment of different sectors, and the benefits of
SemTree features. To analyze which were the best
performing features within sectors, we extracted
the best performing frame fragments for the po-
larity task using a tree kernel feature engineering
method presented in Pighin and Moschitti (2009).
The algorithm selects the most relevant features in
accordance with the weights estimated by SVM,
and uses these features to build an explicit repre-
sentation of the kernel space. Figure 3 shows the
best performing SemTree fragments of the polar-
ity task for the consumer staples sector.
Recall that we hypothesized differences in
semantic frame features across sectors. This
shows up as large differences in the strength
of features across sectors. More strikingly, the
same feature can differ in polarity across sec-
tors. For example, in consumer staples, (EVAL-
UEE(Judgment communication)) has positive po-
larity, compared with negative polarity in informa-
tion technology sector. The examples we see indi-
cate that the positive cases pertain to aggressive re-
tail practices that lead to lawsuits with only small
fines, but whose larger impact benefits the bottom
line. A typical case is the sentence, The plaintiffs
accused Wal-Mart of discriminating against dis-
abled customers by mounting ?point-of-sale? ter-
minals in many stores at elevated heights that can-
not be reached. Lawsuits in the IT sector, on the
other hand, are often about technology patent dis-
putes, and are more negative, as illustrated by our
example sentence in Figure 2.
SemTree features capture the differences be-
tween semantic roles for the same frame, and be-
tween the same semantic role in different frames.
For example, the PERCEIVER AGENTIVE role of
the Perception active frame contributes to predic-
tion of an increase in price, as in R.J. Reynolds
is watching this situation closely and will respond
as appropriate. Conversely, a company that fills
the PHENOMENON role of the same frame con-
tributes to prediction of a price decrease, as in In-
vestors will get a clearer look at how the market
values the Philip Morris tobacco businesses when
Altria Group Inc. ?when-issued? shares begin
trading on Tuesday. When a company fills the
VICTIM role in the Cause harm frame, this can
predict a decrease in price, as in Hershey has
been hurt by soaring prices for cocoa, energy and
other commodities, whereas filling the VICTIM
role in the Defend frame is associated with an in-
crease in price, as in At Berkshire?s annual share-
holder meeting earlier this month, Warren Buffett
defended Wal-Mart , saying the scandal did not
change his opinion of the company.
One weakness of our approach that we dis-
cussed above is that there is a strong effect of
time that we do not address. The same SemTree
feature can be predictive for one time period and
not for another. (GOODS(Commerce sell)) is re-
lated to a decrease in price for 2008 and 2009 but
to an increase in price for 2010-2012. There is
clearly an influence of the overall economic con-
text that we do not take into account. For example,
880
the practices of acquiring or selling a business are
different in downturning versus recovering mar-
kets. An important observation of the MCC val-
ues, especially in the case of SemTreeFWD is that
MCC increases during the years 2011-2012. We
attribute this change to the difficulty of predicting
stock price trends when there is the high volatil-
ity typical of a financial crisis. The effect of news
on volatility, however, can be explored indepen-
dently. For example, Creamer et al (2012) detect
a strong association.
Another weakness of our approach is that we
take sentences out of context, which can lead
to prediction errors. For example, the sentence
Longs? real estate assets alone are worth some
$2.9 billion, or $71.50 per share, Ackman wrote,
meaning that CVS would essentially be paying
for real estate, but gaining Longs? pharmacy ben-
efit management business and retail operations for
free is treated as predicting a positive polarity for
CVS. This would be accurate if CVS was actually
going to acquire Longs? business. Later in the
same news item, however, there is a sentence indi-
cating that the sale will not go through, which pre-
dicts negative polarity for CVS: Pershing Square
Capital Management said on Thursday it won?t
support a tender offer from CVS Caremark Corp
for rival Longs Drug Stores Corp because the of-
fer price ?materially understates the fair value of
the company,? according to a filing.
8 Conclusion
We have presented a model for predicting stock
price movement from news. We proposed FWD
(Frames, BOW, and part-of-speech specific DAL)
features and SemTree data representations. Our
semantic frame-based model benefits from tree
kernel learning using support vector machines.
The experimental results for our feature represen-
tation perform significantly better than BOW on
the polarity task, and show promise on the change
task. It also facilitates human interpretable analy-
sis to understand the relation between a company?s
market value and its business activities. The sig-
nals generated by this algorithm could improve the
prediction of a financial time series model, such as
ADS (Rydberg and Shephard, 2003).
Our future work will consider the contextual in-
formation for sentence selection, and an aggrega-
tion of weighted news content based on the decay
effect over time for individual companies. We plan
to use a moving window for training and testing.
We will also explore different labeling methods,
such as a threshold for price change tuned by sec-
tors and background economics.
