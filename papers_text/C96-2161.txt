This p~q)er describes a. method for posit io, ing un- 
known words in an existing thesa,rus  by using word- 
to-word rela.tionships with relation (case) markers 
extracted from a large corpus. A suitable area (if the 
thesaurus for an unknown woM ix estimated l)y inte- 
grating the human intuition I)urled in the thesaurus 
and statistical data extracted from the corpus. To 
overcome the prohlem of data sparseness, distin- 
guishing features of each node, called "viewpoints" 
are. extracted a.utomatically and used to calcMa.te 
the similarity between the unknown woM and a. 
word in the thesaurus. The results of a.tl experi- 
ment confirm the COrltril)ution of viewl)oints to the 
I)ositioning task. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Thesauruses are among the most useful knowledge 
resources for natural language processing. For ex- 
ample, English thesauruses ttch as Roger's The- 
saurus and WordNet \[4\] are. wideJy used for tasks 
in this area \[,5, 6, a\]. Howew~r, most existing the- 
sauruses are compiled by hand, and eonsequently~ 
the following three problems occur when they are 
used For NI,P systems. 
First, existing thesauruses have insufficient vo- 
cal)ularles~ especially in I~nguages other than En- 
glish. In J~pa, n, there are no free thesauruses that 
can I)e shared by researchers. Vu rthermore, ge.eral-- 
domain thesauruses do not (:over (lomMn-specifie 
terms. 
Se(:ond~ the human intuition used in constrllct- 
ing thesauruses is not explicit. Most existing the- 
sa.tlrttses are hand-crafted by ol)serving huge amounts 
of data on the usage of words. The data a.n(l human 
judgements used in (;onstructhlg thesauruses would 
be very useful in NLP systems; unfi)rtunately, how- 
eve h this information is not represente(I in the the- 
sauruses. 
'l~hird, the structure of thesauruses is subjec-- 
hive. The depth and (lensity of nodes it, (tree-llke.) 
thesauruses directly a:\[l~ct tilt', calculated distances 
between words. For example, n(>des fi)r biological 
words haw=, many levels, while abstract words are 
classified in relatively shallow lew4s. However, ex- 
isting thesauruses only represent unif(lrm relation- 
ships between words. 
This pa, per describes a way of overcoming the 
prol)lems, using a, medium-size Japanese thesaurus 
aim large corpus. 'Yhe main goal of our work is 
to expand the thesaurus automatical ly, explicitly 
including distinguishing features (viewpoints), and 
to construct a domain-setlsitive thesaurus ystem. 
:Co expand the vocabulary of the thesaurus, it 
is important  to position new words in it automati -  
(:ally. In this paper, words that are not contained in 
the thesa.urus but that appeared in the corpus more 
than once are called unknown words, l '\['he proper 
positions of the unknown words in the thesaurus are 
estimated by using woM-to-word relationships ex- 
tracte(l from a large:sca.le corpus. This task may be 
similar to word-sense disambiguation, which deter- 
I|Hlles the correct sellse of a, word from several pre- 
defined candidates. However, in l)ositioning a word 
whose sense is 1,11knowtl, a suitable position must be 
selected from thousands of nodes (words) it, the the- 
saurus, and therefore it is very difficult to position 
the word with pinpoint accuracy. Instead~ in this 
paper~ we give a method for determining the area 
in which the unknown words belongs. For example, 
suppose the word "SENTOUKI"  (fighter) 2 is not 
contained in a thesaurus. Calculation of the simi- 
larity between the  word and those in the thesaurus 
a.sslgns it to tile area \[flying vehicle \[air plane, heli- 
copter\]\]. 
Viewpoints are features that  distinguish a. node 
from other nodes in the thesaurus, and are good 
(:lues for estimating the area to which an unknown 
wor<l should be assign(d. The area can be efficiently 
estimate(/ by extracting viewpoints. 
Several systems have used Wor<lNet a.nd statls: 
tieal infi)rmation from large corpora \[31 5, 6\]. How- 
eve.r, there are two common problems: noisy co- 
occurrence of words a,nd data sparseness. In Word- 
Net, since each  node it, the thesaurus is a set of 
words that haw~ synonym relationships (SynSet)~ 
wtrious methods for similarity cah'ulatlon using the 
SynSet classes have been proposed. In this t)aper~ 
I SAMAP \[8\], a hand-crafted Japanese thesaurus, is 
used as a (:ore. To overcome the problems of noise 
1Tha.t is, unknown words do not lne~\[\[ very |ow-frequency 
words. 
~A Jttpa.nese word in ISAMAP is represented by a pair of 
capital Rom~tn letters and the word's English tr~mslatlon.

Stl(:h features are implicitly used in the creation of 
most existing thesauruses according to hilRiaJi in-- 
tuition, they axe lost wheii the constructe(l t\]~le-- 
sara'uses are used. An exception is the Wor(1Net~ 
in which the distinguishing \[ea.tures a.re nlP~nually 
listed. In tliis l)aper~ the distinguishing fea.tllres aa'e 
extracted automaticMly, reflecting the characteris- 
tics of the corpus to be used. 
For example, Figure ,5 shows a f)a.rt of ISAMAP. 
The viewpoint of a. node in the the.sa.urus i esti- 
mated by using a certa.in l)rocedure. Suppose we 
want to extract he viewpoint o\[' the noun "HF, I{IKOP- 
UTAA" (helicopter). Tile wor(t occurs 131 1.iines in 
our corpus. Figure 3.2 shows exa.mples of the rela_ 
tlonshil)s. 
For each rela.tionship~ a sea.tell is nlade h)r nodes 
that have the sa.me relationship. In tile c~se of 
the pattern "TUKAU" (use), 385 nodes with the 
s~mm relationship ~tre extra.cted Ijrom a.reas, scat- 
tered throughout ISAMAP. On the other ha.nd~ the 
pattern "TOBU" (fly) shares only two nodes, h.e- 
licopter aaid aiwlaue. The nodes have direct IS- 
A relationships; in other words, the nodes are c.an 
be connected in the hierareDy of nodes. Since the 
viewpoints of a node are inherited by its children 
in many cases, the existence of the connected nodes 
that include ISA relationships i strong evidence for 
the viewpoints. In this case., (fly, SUB) is a view- 
point for the node "airpla'n% " which is the topmost 
of the connected nodes. 
Viewpoints are extracted by calculating th.c typi- 
cMness of word-to-wo,?t relationsh@s. Given a node 
nd a'nd its candidate viewpoi.n.t (a pair of a relation 
marker rel and a wo,d w), the typicalness of the 
viewpoint is calculated as 
typicalness(nd, tel, w)

where N is a set of no&s  i'n \]b'AMAP, and C 
is a set of conuected no&s  that contain the: word 
w. Examples o i the vie'tvpoi,nts (whose typicalness

Let us consider ~n exainph~ to see how Mgorithm 
works. Suppose the word "SEN'I'OUKI" (fighter a) 
is to be placed in the thesaurus. 
First;, for each node in the 1SAMAP, the slmi- 
l~rity between the word and the node is cMculated. 
The similarity is ca.lculated according to the rollow- 
ing formula.: 
st're(w1, w~ ) = rnax(s imi  , sire2)

and the argument "_" can be any words. If the 
simib~rity va.lue exceeds a pre-delined threshold, the 
node is marked. Figure 6 shows marked nodes that 
h~ve high similarity.

Fig. 9: Rela.tionshi t) I)etweell the uuml>er of rela, 
tionships and the a.ccura,('y (ff 1)ositil)ning 
of the node. For example, the likely area of "heavy 
oir' is "((,I)jeet (lnaterla.l (ruel (g~s, l)em)let.~O)))" , 
whose top node is very a,bsl, ract. \[towew'~r, the rela- 
t.ionshi 1) "heavy oil and gas ~i'' suggests the position 
of "heavy oil." 
By ,sing the proposed method, the existing the- 
sa, urus was expanded to cower a large quantity el 
text. Though ISAMAI ) was designed for general 
purposes, the method alh)ws it to reflect a specific 
domain through tile use of a. dt)ma.in-dependent co l  
pus. One o1" our gems is m develop a corpus-based 
thesaurus, c(msisting I)f' a c()re thesaurus such as 
ISAMAP and a eorl)us that reflects domain knowl- 
edge. When a thesaurus is used for NLI ) applica- 
tions, such as a.n information retrlewd a,nd disam:

al)le positions in the thesa,  rus for unknown words, the thesaurus a~ a, bl~ck box via certain functions. 
I n  co-occurrence based similarity calcula.tion, words 
with strong similarities but whose relatioashit)s seem 
st;r~nge to huma.n intuitioa reduce the a.ceuracy of 
the proposed method. Howew~r, ill trla, lly cases~ 
these strong similarities are caused by less typica.l 
co-occurrences. In Figure 6, the words "buy, .... tmr -
chase," aim "h~ve" convey less informa.tiw, relation 
ships than viewpoint relationships. 
If ttmre are many role.lion,ships \[br an unkuown 
word, the possibility of the existence of viewpoints 
will increase. However, some relationships ma.y be 
noisy. Figure 9 shows the relationships between the 
mtmber of relationships a.nd the ~ccuraey of posi- 
tioning. In this case, the a.cctlra.cy mea.ns the per- 
centa,ge of words tot which the most preh~ra.lde area 
estimated hy the proposed method contained the 
node theft the word really belonged to. As shown 
in Figure 9, 50-100 relationshil~s are needed to es- 
t.im~te the nodes. On the other }ran(l, too ma, ny 
relationships prevent the ext.raction of useful view 
points. 
It is very di\[\[ictdt 1.o position a, word with pin 
point accuracy. Experiment showed lhat the fol 
lowing heuristic is usef l l \ ] ,  I f  a l l  u l l k l toWI l  word  l ies

pa,rtieular area. it can be positioned a.s a sibling 
I%)r examph', the following f/l.ctions are needed fi)r 
a corpus based thesa ,  t l r t l s  system: 
'positiou(w): ret;,rns the position (or pa.th) of the 
word w.  
supcvordi,~al, e(@: returns the superordinate words 
of the word w. 
subovdinale(w): returns the subordinate words of 
tim word w.  
simihrr(,~): returns the words similar to w. 
dista'nc~-(wJ, w~): returns the distance between wl 
and w2. 
It is important that the return vMues of the 
%nctions should be depend on the corpus and the 
locM context of words, s q'he proposed method can 
t)e used to reMize these functions. Viewpoints make 
it po.ssible to realize ;t, dynamic interpretation of dis- 
Lance. 
5 Re la ted  Work  
The method proposed here is rela.ted to two top- 
ics in the litera.ture: ~utomatic onstruction of a 
thesaurus and word-sense disa.mbiguation. 
4The marker TO iudic~tes the conju.ction. 
For this lmrpose., the functions can be exp~nded to con- 
taiu tit(', local conlexl o\[ the word as augmeutations of the 
functions (e.g. posltion(w, context(w))).
