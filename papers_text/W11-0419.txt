Abstract
In this paper, we discuss some of the chal-
lenges of adequately applying a specification
language to an annotation task, as embodied
in a specific guideline. In particular, we dis-
cuss some issues with TimeML motivated by
error analysis on annotated TLINKs in Time-
Bank. We introduce a document level in-
formation structure we call a narrative con-
tainer (NC), designed to increase informative-
ness and accuracy of temporal relation identi-
fication. The narrative container is the default
interval containing the events being discussed
in the text, when no explicit temporal anchor
is given. By exploiting this notion in the cre-
ation of a new temporal annotation over Time-
Bank, we were able to reduce inconsistencies
and increase informativeness when compared
to existing TLINKs in TimeBank.
1 Introduction
In linguistic annotation projects, there is often a gap
between what the annotation schema is designed to
capture and how the guidelines are interpreted by the
annotators and adjudicators given a specific corpus
and task (Ide and Bunt, 2010; Ide, 2007). The dif-
ficulty in resolving these two aspects of annotation
is compounded when tasks are looked at in a poten-
tially incomplete annotation task; namely, where the
guideline is following a specification to a point, but
in fact human annotation is not even suggested as
complete because it would be infeasible. Creating
temporal links to represent the timeline of events in
a document is an example of this: human annota-
tion of every possible temporal relationship between
events and times in a narrative would be an over-
whelming task.
In this paper, we discuss how temporal rela-
tion annotation must be sensitive to two aspects of
the task that were not mentioned in the TimeBank
guideline (Pustejovsky et al, 2005): (a) sensitivity
to the genre and style of the text; and (b) the interac-
tion with discourse relations that explicitly reference
the flow of the narrative in the text. We believe that
making reference to both these aspects in the text
during the annotation process will increase overall
informativeness and accuracy of the annotation. In
the present paper, we focus primarily on the first of
these points, and introduce a document level infor-
mation structure we call a narrative container (NC).
Because of the impossibility of humans captur-
ing every relationship, it is vital that the annotation
guidelines describe an approach that will result in
maximally informative temporal links without rely-
ing on standards that are too difficult to apply. With
this in mind, we have been examining the TimeBank
corpus (Pustejovsky et al, 2003) and the annotation
guideline that created it, and have come to these re-
alizations:
(1) ? The guideline does not specify certain types
of annotations that should be performed;
? The guideline forces some annotations to be
performed when they should not always be.
Additionally, we have discovered some inconsisten-
cies in the TimeBank corpus related to temporal
links. Furthermore, upon examination, we have be-
come aware of the importance of the text style and
152
genre, and how readers interpret temporally unah-
chored events.
This gave rise, in examining the genres that are
most frequent in TimeBank (namely news and fi-
nance), to the possibility that readers of news ar-
ticles and narratives have possible default assump-
tions about when unanchored events take place. It
seems reasonable for a reader to assume in a sen-
tence such as: Oneida Ltd. declared a 10% stock
dividend, payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov.
17, that the ?declared? event took place soon before
the article?s Document Creation Time (DCT).
Exactly how soon before may be related to some
proximate interval of time associated with both the
publication time and frequency. That is, it appears
that just as importantly, if not more so, than the DCT,
is a related and dependent notion of the salient in-
terval surrounding the creation time, for interpreting
the events that are being reported or written about.
We will call this the Narrative Container. There
seems to be a default value for this container affected
by many variables. For example, a print newspaper
seems to associate in the content and style a nar-
rative container of approximately 24 hours, or one
business day. A newswire article, on the other hand,
has a narrative container of 2-10 hours. Conversely,
weekly and monthly publications would likely have
a narrative container of a much longer duration (a
week or more).
Along with the narrative container, there are two
related concepts that proved useful in framing this
new approach to temporal annotation. The Narra-
tive Scope describes the timespan described in the
document, with the left marker defined by the earli-
est event mentioned in the document, and the right
by the event furthest in the future. The other impor-
tant concept is that of Narrative Time. A Narrative
Time is essentially the current temporal anchor for
events in a document, and can change as the reader
moves through the narrative.
With these as initial assumptions we did some
cursory inspection of the TimeBank data to deter-
mine if there was a correlation between Narrative
Container length and genre, and found it to be a
compelling assumption. With that in mind, we de-
termined that TLINK creation should be focused on
relationships to the narrative container, rather than
to the DCT.
Our goal is, to the extent possible, to see how
we can use a container metaphor, albeit somewhat
underspecified, to left-delineate the container within
which unanchored events might be in relation to.
2 Identifying Temporal Relations
While low-level temporal annotation tasks such as
identifying events and time expressions are rela-
tively straightforward and can be marked up with
high consistency, high-level tasks such as arrang-
ing events in a document in a temporal order have
proved to be much more challenging. The tempo-
ral ordering of events in a document, for example, is
accomplished by identifying all distinct event-event
pairings. For a document that has n events, this
requires the annotation of
(n
2
)
events pairs. Ob-
viously, for general-purpose annotation, where all
possible events are considered, the number of event
pairs grows essentially quadratically to the number
of events, and the task quickly becomes unmanage-
able.
There are, however, strategies that we can adopt
to make this labeling task more tractable. First we
need to distinguish the domains over which ordering
relations are performed. Temporal ordering relations
in text are of three kinds:
(2) a. A relation between two events;
b. A relation between two times;
c. A relation between a time and an event.
TimeML, as a formal specification of the temporal
information conveyed in language, makes no dis-
tinction between these ordering types. But a human
reader of a text does make a distinction, based on
the discourse relations established by the author of
the narrative (Miltsakaki et al, 2004; Poesio, 2004).
Temporal expressions denoting the local Narrative
Container in the text act as embedding intervals
within which events occur. Within TimeML, these
are event-time anchoring relations (TLINKs). Dis-
course relations establish how events relate to one
another in the narrative, and hence should constrain
temporal relations between two events. Thus, one
of the most significant constraints we can impose is
to take advantage of the discourse structure in the
document before event-event ordering relations are
identified.
153
Although, in principle, during an annotation a
temporal relation can be specified between any two
events in the text, it is worth asking what informa-
tiveness a given temporal relation introduces to the
annotation. The informativeness of an annotation
will be characterized as a function of the information
contained in the individual links and their closure.
We can distinguish, somewhat informally for now,
two sources of informativeness in how events are
temporally ordered relative to each other in a text:
(a) externally and (b) internally. Consider first ex-
ternal informativeness. This is information derived
from relations outside the temporal relation con-
straint set, e.g., as coming from explicit discourse re-
lations between events (and hence is associated with
the relations in (2a) above). For example, we will
assume that, for two events, e1 and e2, in a text, the
temporal relation between them is more informative
if they are also linked through a discourse relation,
e.g., a PDTB relation (Prasad et al, 2008). Mak-
ing such an assumption will allow us to focus in on
the temporal relations that are most valuable without
having to exhaustively annotate all event pairs.
Now consider internal informativeness. This is
information derived from the nature of the relation
itself, as defined largely by the algebra of relations
(Allen, 1984; Vilain et al, 1986). First, we assume
that, for two events, e1 and e2, a temporal relation
R1 is more informative than R2 if R1 entails R2.
More significantly, however, as noted above, is to
capitalize on the relations that inhere between events
and the times that anchor them (i.e., (2c) above).
Hence, we will say that, given an event, e1 and a
time t1, a temporal relation R is more informative
the more it anchors e1 to t1. That is, a containment
relation is more informative than an ordering rela-
tion, and the smaller the container, the more infor-
mative the relation.1
The Document Creation Time (DCT) as designed
in TimeML is introduced as a reference time, against
which the mentioned events and time expressions in
the document can be ordered. Consider the text frag-
ment below.
1We defer discussion of the formal definition of informative-
ness for the present paper, as we are focusing on initial results
over re-annotated data in TimeBank.
4-10-2011
Local officials reported yesterday that a
car exploded in downtown Basra.
The TimeML annotation guideline (AG) suggests
identifying relations between the DCT and textual
events. Hence standard markup as in TimeBank re-
sults in the following sort of annotation:
(3) a. DCT= t1, val=10-04-2011
b. t2 = yesterday, val=09-04-2011
b. e1 = report
c. e2 = explode
d. TLINK1 = before(e1, t1)
e. TLINK2 = before(e2, t1)
f. TLINK3 = includes(t2, e1)
This is a prototypical annotation fragment. Notice
that by focusing on the link between events and the
DCT, the annotator is forced to engage in a kind of
periodic ?back-and-forth? evaluation of the events
in the text, relative to the DCT. While there is a con-
tainer TIMEX3 that bounds e1, there is no informa-
tion given grounding the actual time of the event of
interest, namely, the explosion, e2. By following the
AG literally and through no fault of their own, the
annotators have missed an opportunity to provide a
more informative markup; namely, the identification
of the TLINK below:
(4) TLINK4 = includes(t2, e2)
That is, the explosion occurred on the date valued
for yesterday, i.e., ?09-04-2011?.
The point of this paper is to discuss the difference
encountered when applying a specification given a
particular guideline for annotating a body of text.
The example we want to discuss is the manner in
which events are linked (related) to the Document
Creation Time (DCT) in TimeML. These consider-
ations have arisen in the context of new annotation
problems in different genre and domains, hoping to
apply the principles of TimeML.
3 Narrative Scope
As previously mentioned, the Narrative Scope of a
document is the temporal span over which the events
in a document occur, as defined by the timexes in a
154
document. While not every event in a document will
necessarily occur inside the Narrative Scope (some
may still occur before or after any dates that are
specifically mentioned), the Narrative Scope pro-
vides a useful container for describing when events
discussed most likely occurred. The narrative scope
was not considered as part of the annotation task,
but it did help to ground the concepts of Narrative
Containers and Narrative Times.
4 Narrative Time
As a reader moves through a document, the intro-
duction of a new TIMEX will often shift the tem-
poral focus of the events to be anchored to this new
time point (Smith, 2003). These temporal anchors
are what we refer to as Narrative Times, and func-
tion in much the same way as newly introduced lo-
cations in spatial annotation.
However, consider how we can use Narrative
Times to increase accuracy of the TLINKS over a
document in TimeML. As mentioned above, we dis-
tinguish three types of temporal orderings in a text:
time-time, event-time, and event-event. The first
identifies orderings between two TIMEX3 expres-
sions and is performed automatically. The second
identifies what the local Narrative Time for an event
is, i.e., how an EVENT is anchored to a TIMEX3.
Event-event pairings, for the purposes of this paper,
will not be discussed, though they are a vital and
complex component of temporal annotation, largely
involving discourse relations.
To illustrate our proposed strategy, consider the
news article text shown below.
April 25, 2010 7:04 p.m. EDT -t0
S1: President Obama paid-e1 tribute Sunday -t1
to 29 workers killed-e2 in an explosion -e3 at a
West Virginia coal mine earlier this month- t2,
saying-e4 they died-e5 ?in pursuit of the Amer-
ican dream.?
S2: The blast-e6 at the Upper Big Branch Mine
was the worst U.S. mine disaster in nearly 40
years.
There are three temporal expressions in the above
text: the Document Creation time, t0; and two
TIMEXes, t1 and t2. Each of these TIMEXes func-
tions as a Narrative Time, as they are clearly provid-
ing temporal anchors to nearby events. In this case,
all the events are located within the Narrative Time
appropriate to them. Hence, the number of order-
ings is linearly determined by the number of events
in the document, since each is identified with a sin-
gle Narrative Time. Knowing the narrative time as-
sociated with each event will allow us to perform
limited temporal ordering between events that are
associated with different narrative times, which, as
mentioned above, is significantly more informative
than if events were only given partial orderings to
the DCT or to each other.
5 Narrative Containers
So far we have examined sentences that contain
specific temporal anchors for the events discussed.
Consider, however, the following sentences from ar-
ticle wsj 1031.tml in TimeBank:
10-26-1989
1 Philip Morris Cos., New York, adopted a
defense measure designed to make a hostile
takeover prohibitively expensive.
2 The giant foods, tobacco and brewing company
said it will issue common-share purchase rights to
shareholders of record Nov. 8.
Aside from the DCT, the only TIMEX in these
two sentences is Nov. 8, which is only anchoring is-
sue and record. The other events in the sentences
can only be connected to the DCT, and presum-
ably only in a ?before? or ?after? TLINK?in the ab-
sence of other information, any reader would assume
from the past tenses of adopted and said that these
events occurred before the article was published, and
that any events associated with the future (make,
takeover) are intended to happen after the DCT.
However most readers, knowing that the Wall
Street Journal is published daily, will likely assume
that any event mentioned which is not specifically
associated with a date, occurred within a certain
time frame?it would be extremely unusual for a
newspaper to use the construction presented above
if the events actually occurred, for example, a year
or even a week prior to the publication date. We call
this assumed window the Narrative Container, as it
provides left and right boundaries for when unan-

chored events most likely occurred, where in pre-
vious TimeML annotations these events would usu-
ally be given one-sided relationships to the DCT. In
most cases, the right boundary of the Narrative Con-
tainer is the DCT. The left boundary, however, re-
quires other factors about the article to be taken into
account before it can be given a value. The primary
factor is how frequently the source of the document
is published, but other aspects of the article may also
determine the Narrative Container size.
5.1 Style, Genre, Channel, and Anchors
In order to determine what factors might influence
the interpretation of the size of a Narrative Con-
tainer, we asked an undergraduate researcher to cat-
egorize each of the articles in TimeBank according
to the following characteristics (Lee, 2001; Biber,
2009).
(5) ? Channel: is the document written or spoken?
? Production circumstances: how was the doc-
ument distributed? broadcast, newswire, daily
publication;
? Style: what format was used to present the
information?
? Presence of a temporal anchor: Whether an
article contained a Narrative Time in the first
sentence of the document.
In general, we felt that the production circum-
stances would be the most relevant in determining
the duration of the Narrative Container. The distri-
butions of the different categories in TimeBank are
shown in Table 1. There is a 100% overlap between
the ?broadcast? and ?spoken? subcategories?all of
those articles are word-for-word transcripts of tele-
vision news reports. The ?style? category proved the
most difficult to define?the ?quiz? article is a broad-
cast transcript of a geography question asked during
the evening news, while the ?biography? articles are
overviews of people?s lives. The editorials include a
letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal and an
editorial column from the New York Times.

6 Preliminary Studies
In order to assess the validity of our theories on Nar-
rative Containers, Time, and Scope, we asked three
undergraduate researchers to re-annotate TimeBank
using the Narrative Container theory as a guide.
Each annotator evaluated all of the events in
TimeBank by identifying the temporal constraint
that anchored the event. If the annotators felt that
the event was not specifically anchored, they could
156
place it within the Narrative Container for the docu-
ment, or they could give the event a simple ?before?
or ?after? value related to the Narrative Container or
Document Creation Time. We also asked them to
assign start and end times to the Narrative Container
for each document.
The annotation here was not intended to be as
complete as the TimeBank annotation task, or even
the TempEval tasks?rather, the goal was to deter-
mine if the Narrative Container theory could be ap-
plied in a way that resulted in an increase in infor-
mativeness, and whether the annotators could work
with the idea of a Narrative Container. Because
these annotations are not comprehensive in their
scope, the analysis provided here is somewhat pre-
liminary, but we believe it is clear that the use of a
Narrative Container in temporal annotations is both
informative and intuitive.
6.1 Narrative container agreement
Each annotator was asked to assign a value to the
narrative container of each document. They were
given limited directions as to what the size of an NC
might be: only some suggestions regarding possible
correlations between type and frequency of publica-
tion and size of the narrative container. For example,
it was suggested that a news broadcast might have a
narrative container of only a few hours, a daily news-
paper would have one of a day (or one that extended
to the previous business day), and a newswire article
would have a narrative container that extended back
24 hours from the time of publication.
All the annotators agreed that an NC would not
extend forward beyond the document creation time
(DCT), and that in most cases the NC would end at
the DCT. Because the annotators gave their data on
the size of the NC in free text (for example, an an-
notator would say ?1 day? to indicate that the NC
for an article began the day before the article was
published) the comparison of the narrative contain-
ers was performed manually by one of the authors to
determine if the annotators agreed on the size of the
NC.
Agreement was determined using a fairly strict
matching criterion?if the narrative containers given
were clearly referring to the same interval they were
interpreted to be the same. If, however, there was
ambiguity about the date or one annotator indicated
a smaller time period than another, then they were
judged to be different. A common example of am-
biguity was related to newspaper articles that were
written on Mondays?annotators could not always
determine if the events described occurred the day
before, or on the previous business day For eval-
uation purposes, the ambiguous cases were given
?maybe? values, but were not included in analysis
that relied on the NCs being the same.
Overall, using the strict agreement metric all the
annotators agreed on the size of the narrative con-
tainer in 95 out of 183 articles?slightly over 50% of
the time. However, the annotators only completely
disagreed on 6 of the 183 articles?in all other cases
there was some level of agreement between pairs of
annotators.
6.2 NCs and Document Classifications
We compared Narrative Container agreements
against the categories outlined above: style, channel,
production circumstances, and temporal anchorings
in order to determine if any of those attributes lent
themselves to agreement about the size of the Narra-
tive Container. We disregarded the biography, quiz,
and editorial classifications as those categories were
too small to provide useful data.
For the most part, no one category stood out as
lending itself to accuracy?newswire had the high-
est levels of agreement at 72%, while daily papers
came in at 58%. Written channels had 60% agree-
ment, and the finance style had 59%. Articles with
temporal anchors in the beginning of the document
were actually slightly less likely to have agreement
on the Narrative Container than those that didn?t?
48% and 53%, respectively.
While the higher disagreement levels over Nar-
rative Container size in the presence of a temporal
anchor seems counter-intuitive, it stems from a sim-
ple cause: if the temporal anchor overlapped with
the expected narrative container but was not exactly
the same size, sometimes one annotator would use
that anchor as the Narrative Container, while the oth-
ers would not. This sometimes also happened with
a Narrative Time that was not at the start of the
document or sometimes even the Narrative Scope
would be used as the Narrative Container. While
in some articles it is the case that a Narrative Time
anchors more events than the Narrative Container,

Figure 2: Distributions of Fleiss Kappa scores over TimeBank categories
that does not make that Narrative Time the Nar-
rative Container for the document?the Narrative
Container is always the interval during which an
unanchored event would be assumed to have taken
place. This point of confusion can easily be clarified
in the guidelines.
Spoken/broadcast articles had the lowest agree-
ment on Narrative Container size, with none of those
articles having complete agreement between anno-
tators. This was largely caused by our annotators
not agreeing on how much time those categories
would encompass by default?two felt that the narra-
tive containers for broadcast news would extend to
only a few hours before going on air, and the other
felt that, like a daily paper, the entire previous day
would be included when dealing with unanchored
times.
As for the question of how large a Narrative Con-
tainer should be for broadcast articles, the size of all
Narrative Containers will need to be studied more
in depth in order to determine how widely they can
be applied? it is possible that in general, the actual
size is less important than the simple concept of the
Narrative Container.
6.3 Agreement over event anchors
The annotators were asked to read each article in
TimeBank and ?create links from each event to the
nearest timex or to the DNC.? They were asked
specifically to not link an event to another event,
only to find the time that would be used to anchor
each event in a timeline. The annotators were also
asked to use only three relationship types: before,
after, and is included (which also stood in for ?over-
lap?). This was done in order to keep the annotation
as simple as possible: we wanted to see if the narra-
tive container was a useful tool in temporal annota-
tion, not produce a full gold standard corpus.
This differs from the TimeML annotation guide-
lines, which suggested only that ?A TLINK has to
be created each time a temporal relationship hold-
ing between events or an event and a time needs to
be annotated.? (Saur?? et al, 2006) Examples given
were for sentences such as ?John drove to Boston on
Monday??cases where an event was specifically re-
lated to a time or another event. However, because
such examples were relatively rare, and temporal re-
lationships are not always so clearly expressed, this
annotation method resulted in a corpus that was not
optimally informative. TimeML also uses a fuller
set of temporal relations.
The NC annotations, on the other hand, are much
richer in terms of informativeness. Annotators most
often linked to the NC, often with an ?is included?
relationship (as in: e1 is included NC). In fact,
roughly 50% of the events were linked to the narra-
tive container and had ?is included? as the relation-
ship type. In previous TimeML annotations, most of
those events would have been annotated as simply
occurring before or overlapping with the document
creation time, which is a significantly less informa-
tive association. Clearly the narrative container was
an intuitive concept for the annotators, and one that
was relevant to their annotations.
6.3.1 Inter-annotator agreement
We used Fleiss? kappa (Fleiss, 1971) to obtain values
for agreement between the three annotators: first,
we compared the number of times they agreed what
the temporal anchor for an event should be, then we
compared whether those links that matched had the
same relation type. Data analysis was done in R with
the irr package (R Team, 2009; Gamer et al, 2010).

Solid lines indicate events and times in the box have IS INCLUDED relationships with the timex at the top, and
dotted lines indicate events that were given IDENTITY relationships
When looking at the kappa scores for the tempo-
ral anchor, it should be noted that these scores do
not always accurately reflect the level of agreement
between annotators. Because of the lack of variabil-
ity, Fleiss? Kappa will interpret any article where an
annotator only linked events to the NC received neg-
ative agreement scores. These values have been left
in the tables as data points, but it should be noted
that these annotations are entirely valid?some ar-
ticles in TimeBank contain no temporal information
other than the document creation time (and by exten-
sion, the narrative container), making it only natural
for the annotators to annotate events only in rela-
tion to the narrative container. The average Fleiss?
Kappa scores for the temporal anchors was .74, with
a maximum of 1 and a minimum of -.04.
6.4 Informativeness in NC Annotation
As we previously described, Narrative Containers
are theoretically more informative than Document
Creation Times when trying to place unanchored
events on a timeline. In practice, they are as infor-
mative as we anticipated: compare the visualizations
of TLINK annotations between TimeBank and the
NC links in Figure 3. These were created from the
file wsj 1042.tml, one that had complete agreement
between annotators about both the size of the NC
(one day before the DCT through the DCT) and all
the temporal anchors and temporal relations.
Clearly, the NC task has resulted in a more in-
formative annotation?all the events have at least one
constraint, and most have both left and right con-
straints.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
Narrative Containers, Narrative Times, and Narra-
tive Scopes are important tools for temporal annota-
tion tasks. The analysis provided here clearly shows
that annotating with an NC increases informative-
ness, and that the concept is sufficiently intuitive for
it to not add confusion to the already complicated
task of temporal annotation. However, the work in
this area is far from complete. In the future we in-
tend to study where the left boundary of the NC
should be placed for different genres and publica-
tion frequencies. Another annotation task must be
performed, requiring a more comprehensive TLINK
creation guideline, using both event-time and event-
event links. Finally, the use of all three concepts for
automated annotation tasks should be examined, as
they may prove as useful to machines as they are to
humans.
