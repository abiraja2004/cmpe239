0. A bottleneck of all produetional-oriented 
machine translation systems is to handle 
those words which are not included into 
main dictionaries of the particular system. 
In this paper we want to describe one 
possible approach to this problem, based on 
the idea of the so-called transduetlonal 
dictionary. The first part of the paper is 
devoted to the results of our empirical 
inquiry into the problem in closely related 
languages, the second one to the description 
of the implementatio" of the transducing 
dictionary in the Czech-to-Russian machine 
translation system RUSLAN (Hajji, 1987). 
1.1. The basic idea of the transducing dic- 
tionary, originally developed by Z.Kirschner 
for the Engllsh-to-Czech NT system APAC 
(Kirschner, !987, l{ajiSov6 and ~irsehner, 
1987), is quite simple. Among the words 
which failed to be found in the basic dic- 
tionaries of the system, are some special 
sets of words, which are very similar in 
both languages. The goal of the transducing 
dictionary is to translate those words pro- 
perly according to the rules, dealing with 
regularit ies between source and target shape 
of them. This way of handling lexicon as an 
open system differs substantically from the 
traditional one. It is very useful especia\]- 
ly in the translation of the scientific or 
technical texts where many international 
words are used. 
The transducing dictionary (TD), origi- 
nally used for ~T between English and Czech 
languages, handled mostly international 
(Greek-Latin) words. We have assumed that 
there will be a greater number of lexico- 
derivational parallels between two closely 
related languages and that they will contri- 
bute to a successful analysis to a greater 
extent. This assumption turned to be false. 
1.2. Let us now turn to some issues of a 
contrastive analysis of Czech and Russian to 
investigate, where the idea of TD could be 
applied for the translation between these 
two languages. 
For instance, the Czech ending -ace is 
translated as -acija, as in modlfikace - 
modlf ikaeija "modification" etc.; thus, e.g. 
if the Cz. word "emulace" is not found in 
the main dictionary, it is translated by the 
transducing rule as "emulaeiJa". A word 
translated in this algorithmic way may be 
subdued to the procedure of orthographic 
changes and modif ications, in which some 
rules of Cz.-R. alternation of graphemes are 
applied, as, e.g., ~--~e, h--~g, y~i  , x-~ks, 
au-~av, ou-~u, the initial e-~e, etc. 
It goes without saying that such a 
transduction is accompanied by a risk of 
creating errors or is impossible, e.g., in 
case that the output language lacks such a 
direct derivational variant. However, even 
in such cases it is possible to apply a long  
with the transducing dictionary further 
"emergency rules" and to determine, on the 
basis of the final segment of the wor~, at 
least the type of the word and its grammati- 
cal characteristics, and thus to prevent the 
termination of the analysis of the whole 
sentence due to a single non--identified 
word. Of course, every irregular lexical 
correspondence can be included in the main 
dictionary. 
1.3. The rules of TD, as indicated above, 
can be used with several degrees of comp\]e-- 
xity: from the possibil ity to translate 
"mechanically" without any changes or only 
with some orthographic modif ications as in 
elektroskop - elektroskop - "electroscope", 
through the necessity of certain modif ica- 
tions of the word-formative segment or en- 
ding according to the needs of the target 
language as in algoritmus - algoritm 
"algorithm" to the l imitation to a mere 
identif ication of the word as for its word 
class, or, as the case may be, its morpholo- 
gical or semantic characteristics as, e.g., 
with tla~Itko - knopka "push-button", where 
the ending segment -tko points to the noun, 
neuter, ~enoting an instrument (means). 
314 
Accord ing  to these degrees,  the set of 
der ivat iona l  morphemes product ive for the 
domain of computer  techniques can be c lass i -  
fied into several groups; not always we are, 
of course,  concerned with a suffix in a 
str ict ly  l inguist ic  spec i f icat ion of the 
term; rather ,  we deal with a segment which 
has for the given pair of  languages the 
required propert ies  (it may consist  of two 
suff ixes or their  parts,  as, e.g. ,  in -kce, 
-uee, and also of an or iginal  word stem, as 
gram; we quote here segments in the form of 
nominat ive  sing.,  i.e. together  with the 
inf lect ional  ending). 
1.3.1. The most substant ia l  part of the 
f irst group consists  in words denot ing the 
names of mach ines ,  devices and instruments ,  
and also some names of agents of events,  of 
some propert ies  and processes.  These words 
can be t rans lated to Russian by a mere 
t ranscr ipt ion.  The fo l lowing suff ixes are 
members of this group: 
-skop, -metr,  -tot,  -graf ,  - tron,  -fen, -at, 
- log, ~ant, -ent,  -tufa, ~ika. 
I.\[~.2. The next group contains nouns and 
adject ives the form of which must he modi -  
f ied accord ing to models customary in the 
target language,  which involves some minor 
changes in the der lvat ional  segment or en- 
ding. The respect ive suff ixes are: 
-smus/ -zm,  -ace/ -ac i Ja  , -kce/--kclja , -use/ 
-uel Ja,  -ance/ -anoi Ja,  -ence/ -enei Ja ,  - ie/ 
- i J~, -gram/-gzamma,  -aze / -az is , -~eze/ -ez ls ,  
-Ita/-ost', - ium/- l J ,  - ista/- ist .  
Certa in regular i t ies  of t rans lat ion of 
der ivat lonal  suf f ixes carl be observed also 
wlth ad ject ives ,  which form an important 
part of termino logy,  of. the fo l lowing 
correspondence:  
~Ick@/- i~eski J  , -~rn~/-arnyj  , -~ln~/-a~nyJ  , 
-antn l / -antny j ,  -entn~/-entny j ,  -~nl/  
-c lonnyJ ,  - ivn~/-~vnyJ .  
1.3.~. The third group includes semant ica l ly  
uni form and product ive classes of words,  as, 
e.g. ,  deverbat ive  nouns ending with -ani~ 
-end, which denote in Czech a process or its 
result  (kodov~n~ - encoding,  spou~t~n~ - 
switch ing on ), nouns in -ost denot ing a 
property  (pra~nost - dust innes,  v lhkost  - 
humid i ty ) ,  nouns in -tel denot ing an animate 
or inanimate actor (odh~ratel  - consumer,  
ukazatel  - marker)  and also nouns in -~t~ 
with the meaning of a certain ~lace or space 
(nalezi~t~ - deposi t ,  praeovi~%~ - work ing 
place) and nouns in -tvl with the meaning of 
a feature,  workshop or property (mno~stvl  - 
a number of, pekagstv~ - bakery,  bohatstv~ -- 
r ichness).  All these word- format ive  types 
have a corresponding equivalence in Russ ian,  
with minor  modi f icat ions.  However,  in the 
course of the long-term development ,  the 
semantic shifts of the word basis prevent 
the poss ib i l i ty  of the t rans lat ion of these 
types only by means of the word- format ion 
correspondence of the t ransducing dictlona-- 
ry. TD cannot do here more than specify the 
word class or the gender. These data can be 
used in the syntactic analysis of the source 
language but in the D. output the word has 
to be marked as not boeing found in the 
dict ionary.  
I.~.4. There is one more group of words we 
encounter  in technical  texts which is pro-  
ductlve in Czech and has a clearly specif ied 
meaning. There belong the nouns in -6 (- 
i~, -a~, -e~): chladi~ - cooler; these nouns 
denote first of all a device or instrument,  
sometimes also an animate actor. The suff ix 
has no word formation paral lel  in R. and is 
subst i tuted by other suff ixes,  or f requent ly  
by a complex naming unit: p~eklada~ - 
t rans l Jator  "translator"  or ptep~na~ - pere-  
k l ju~ate~ "switch". A s imilar s i tuat ion oc- 
curs with the suff ixes -~tko, -~tko, -dlo, 
-~rna, -ovna. Also there suff ixes have no 
corresponding equivalent in P. 
In spite of the fact that ~n this 
group, the der ivat lonal  means determine 
classes charaeter ist lc  both as for their 
meaning and form, this fact is made use of 
onl; part ia l ly  - the transducing device 
easi ly  and correct ly  identi f ies their  word 
class and can asslgn to them morphological  , 
or as the case may be, semantic character i -  
stic. 
3.1. The implementat ion of the t rans~uclnK 
d ict ionary was to a great extent inf luenced 
by the programming language used, namely the 
systems Q (Colmeraurer ,  without date) in 
which the whole system RUSLM~ is written. 
Systems Q provide means for working with 
grammar d i rect ly  in the form of rewr i t ing 
rules,  which are real ized by means of a 
label led graph; the use of a rule means 
adding a new edge. In order to l imit the 
number of rules,  the programme (i.e. the set 
of rewr i t ing rules) is div ided into phases. 
At the end of each phase , the redundant 
edges are removed. The whole system HUSLAN 
consists of 16 phases. 
The TD does not immediate ly  fol low the 
main d ict ionary (i.e. the d ic t ionary  of 
2 
315 
stems) because the mechanism of morphologi- 
cal analysis cannot distinguish at that 
point, which words have been found in the 
dictionary and which have not. This is due 
to the fact that the identif ication is given 
by non-empty intersection of the pattern of 
the stem and the patterns that come into 
consideration as the patterns of the ending; 
this intersection is identified by the phase 
immediately following the dictionary look- 
up. In the next phase, a preliminary syntac- 
tic analysis is carried out, in the course 
of which the unambiguous words found in the 
dictionary and immediately depending on each 
other are put together. At this point, the 
rules of the TD are applied. 
The forms which have not been found in 
the main dictionary pass through the phases 
unchanged. In the first phase of the TD two 
kinds of rules are applied - the first one 
dealing with the groups from 1.3.1. and 
1.3.2. and the second one with the rest 
(I.3.3. and 1.3.4.). The only difference 
among those two types of rewriting rules is 
that the second one does not transcribe the 
Cz. lexical value of the word into the R. 
Both add morphological characteristics and 
se,~antical features to  particular endings. 
The first phase of %he TD contains also 
the first portion of rules rewriting the 
result of the application of the above men- 
tioned rules (of the first type ). The 
following transcriptions are carried out : 
hi->i, x-~ks, hey (at the beginning of the 
word) -~ev, ou~u,  hy-~gi , all long vowels 
are changed to short, 9~r ,  ~e ,  d~d6,  
t'~t6, n-~n6 ( 6 is a code for the R. soft 
marker) , gy-Pgi , ky~k i .  In this way, the 
original Czech stems (to which the ~. en~ 
dings are attached at this point) are trans- 
cribed into the corresponding R. forms. 
The second phase of TD is added in 
RUSLAN to the phase of Czech analysis in 
which the disintegrated stems are put 
together again. This phase of TD has two 
main tasks: 
(a) to finish the transcription of the Czech 
stems Into the Russian ones, which for tech- 
nical reasons could not be done in the pre- 
ceding phase, 
(b) to modify the form of representation in 
such a way as to be consistent with the 
words that have been found in the 
dictionary; the rules remove the auxil iary 
symbols and put together disintegrated ~us- 
sian lexieal unit. 
The third phase of TD processes a rat- 
her small set of words which have not been 
found in the main dictionary and for which 
none of the rules of the preceding phases of 
TD can be applied. This unrecognized words 
are great obstacle for the build-up of the 
dependency tree because they do not allow 
the parts that stand to their left and to 
their right to be put together in the course 
of the syntactico-semantic analysis. As a 
temporary solution of this problem, tho 
rules of this phase rewrite all hitherto 
unidentif ied words as nouns in neuter sing. 
For a more reliable solution, the work is in 
progress to distinguish between the endings 
in a more subtle way (e.g. those forms en- 
ding in -~ should be assigned the word class 
of adverbs, etc.). The default procedure of 
the third phase of TD arrives at a dead end 
in case the unidentified word is a verb, 
since then the sentence lacks its key ele- 
ment - the root of the tree. 
It is evident that none of the g~liding 
lines applied in the TS in its present form 
is 100% valid. However, it has a great value 
for the experlmental test ing of the system 
because it filters out words that have to be 
added to the dictionaries of the system.
