Abstract: Due to the lack of external formal marks, components in Chinese discourse can hardly be 
categorized into the traditional syntactic system. In fact, Chinese is a typical topic-prominent language, so 
it should rather be analyzed from the point of topic. This paper, targeting at computer processing, raises the 
concepts of punctuation clause, generalized topic, discourse structure and topic clause, and reveals the 
properties of Chinese discourse structure based on generalized topic. The applicability of this theory has 
been validated in an initial experiment. 
Keywords: Punctuation Clause, Generalized Topic, Discourse Structure, Topic Clause. 
 
1. Punctuation Clause, Generalized Topic and Discourse Structure 
The traditional study on syntax is based on individual sentences and the formal marks of syntactic 
components. But due to the lack of external formal marks, the concept of sentence in Chinese is not clear 
and the boundary of sentences is difficult to be defined. What?s more, there are no formal means to 
discriminate variant types of syntactic structures. Therefore, the traditional parsing often meets difficulty 
when it comes to Chinese. This paper does not intend to provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
achievements and deficiency of the work done by the scholars in this field before. The study is rather 
based on the factual language phenomena in Chinese and oriented to computer processing of the language. 
In this paper, some concepts, including punctuation clause, generalized topic, discourse structure and topic 
clause, are defined, and some properties of Chinese discourse structure are raised, and initial verification 
done in practical application. 
The basic unit of a Chinese discourse is punctuation clause (PClause). A PClause is a string of words 
separated by comma, semicolon, period, exclamation mark, question mark or quotation marks. Since 
PClauses can be identified with formal marks, and their internal structure and their relations with each 
other are restrained, therefore the basic conditions of processing them with computers are satisfied.  
E.g. 1.1. (Adopted from newspaper news) 
?????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????? 
(?Suddenly??he heard the sound of water in the washroom.?the police officers and the special 
policemen kicked the door open??wrestled the man in the washroom on the floor and handcuffed him?
?after identifying??was nobody but Ye Chengjian.1 ) 
This is a discourse fragment composed of 6 punctuation clauses. 
E.g. 1.2. (Adopted from newspaper news) 
?????????????????????????????????????????
???????????????????? 
(?Ye Chengjian confessed murders in Zhuhai, seducing and blackmailing a Taiwan businessman 
named You, ? and the four armed robbery in Macao?? and identified the places where he illegally hid

standard in English. The same applies hereinafter. 
the guns.) 
This is a discourse fragment composed of 3 punctuation clauses. 
The discourse structure in Chinese is a kind of syntactic structure of a PClause sequence, which is 
composed of a generalized topic and a number of comments. Generalized topic refers to a syntactic 
component of a PClause. The subsequent parts of the punctuation clause after it and the neighbor PClauses 
may be comments about it. Usually a generalized topic is nominal, functioning as the subject, object or 
attributive in the clause in traditional grammar. In this case, the comments answer ?what? and ?how? about 
the topic. The generalized topic can also be verbal, playing the part of the central component of a verb 
phrase. In some cases, the generalized topic can even be adverbial or an individual preposition. That?s why 
the word ?generalized? is adopted. For sake of simplicity, generalized topic will simply be referred to as 
topic in later sections.  
E.g. 1.3. (Adopted from A Tale of Old Man Xing and His Dog, by Zhang Xianliang) 
?????????????????????????????????????????
?????????????????? 
(She collected her needlework, went into the house, swept the kang2, got on it and sat down, lowered 
her head, let her hands dangle between her knees and waited quietly like a prisoner in the hearing room.) 
In this example, each of the seven PClauses has the topic ??(she)? as appears in the first PClause, 
and make comment about ??(she)?, answering the questions about her behavior and what she is like. 
They compose a discourse structure. The first PClause is composed of one topic and one comment, while 
the rest have comment only but no topic. This discourse structure can be expressed below. 
{?[?????????            {She [collected her needlework,  
?????                         went into the house, 
??????                       swept the kang, 
????????                   got on it and sat down, 
?????                         lowered her head, 
?????????                 let her hand dangle between her knees, 
????????????????]}  waited quietly like a prisoner in the hearing room.]} 
For sake of visual cognition, the PClauses are put in different lines and are indented after the topic 
that they comment. This way of expression is called indented new-line representation. What is quoted by 
the ?[]?marks is some comments, the left of which is the topic. And what is quoted by the ?{}?marks is the 
discourse structure.  
E.g. 1.4. (Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu) 
{?[{??[??????          {She [{was wearing only [ a scarlet top, 
????????]}]}                        and navy blue, skin-tight shorts, ]}]} 
These two PClauses both comment on what ????(she was wearing only)?. ???(was wearing 
only)? is one topic, and ??????(a scarlet top)?, and ????????(navy blue, skin-tight shorts)? 
are two comments, answering the question of what was being worn only. The topic and its two comments, 
when combined together, constitute a discourse structure, which is in turn the comment of ??(she)?, 
answering the question of what she was like. In other words, this discourse structure and ?she? constitute 
an external discourse structure.  
E.g. 1.5. (Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu) 
{??{??[????????? 
???????]}} 
                                                        
2 a kind of bed in some parts of China 
{Hung-chien[{was so horrified that[his forehead nearly shrank into his eyebrows,  
(as) his eyebrows rose up to his hairline,]}]} 
These two PClauses both comment on the extent of his being horrified. The verbal structure of verb + 
auxiliary???3?was so horrified??is the topic. The topic and its two comments constitute a discourse 
structure, which is in turn the comment of ???(Hung-chien)?.  
E.g. 1.6. (Adopted from A Tale of Old Man Xing and His Dog, by Zhang Xianliang) 
{???????[{?[??????  {More than 300 people of the team [{all [need feeding, 
??????]}]}                                  need clothing.]}]} 
The two PClauses comment on what ????????(more than 300 people all)?. The generalized 
topic ??(all)? has two comments ??????(need feeding)? and ??????(need clothing)?. They 
both answer ?all? what. ??(all)? and the two comments constitutes a discourse structure, commenting on 
what ????????(more than 300 people all)? were like. The two form external discourse structure. 
E.g. 1.7. (Adopted from Preamble of CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA) 
{???[{??????[??????????????? 
????????????????]} 
???????? 
??????????]} 
{This Constitution, [{in legal form, [affirms the achievements of the struggles of the Chinese people 
of all nationalities,  
(and) defines the basic system and basic tasks of the state;]}  
(it) is the fundamental law of the state,  
(and) has supreme legal authority. ]}  
The adverbial ???????(in legal form)? in the first PClause is the generalized topic. The 
section after it ???????????????(affirms the achievements of the struggles of the 
Chinese people of all nationalities)? and the second PClause ????????????????
(defines the basic system and basic tasks of the state)? are its two comments, answering what is done ?in 
legal form?. These three constitute a discourse structure. This structure, together with the third and the 
fourth PClauses, are all comments on the subject of the first PClause ????(this Constitution)? , 
answering what ????(this Constitution)? is about. These three comments, together with ????(this 
Constitution)?  form the external discourse structure.  
E.g. 1.8. (Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu) 
{??[{?[???????        {The students[{took[grades as too cheap, 
???????]}]}                      courses as too easy]}]} 
The preposition ??4? in the first PClause is the generalized topic. ???????(took grades as too 
cheap)?and ????????(took courses as too easy)? comment on what and its result. These three 
then constitute a discourse structure, making comments on ???(the students)?. They form the external 
discourse structure.  
E.g. 1.9. (Adopted from Royal Tramp (Lu Ding Ji) by Louis Cha) 
????????{????? 
[?????????????????]} 
Gu Yanwu bought at the town{a piece of court bulletin,  
                                                        
3 the word ??? in Chinese is an auxiliary, indicating result. 
4 the word ??? in Chinese is a preposition. It is used in transitive structure, introducing the object. 
[(it) listed in detail the names of the criminals accused in the case of Ming Dynasty history.]} 
The discourse structures in other examples of this section are embedding, while this example is of 
overlapping type. The first PClause ?????????????(Gu Yanwu bought at the town a piece 
of court bulletin)? is a discourse structure. The object ?????(a piece of court bulletin)? is not the 
topic in this PClause, but it is the topic of the second PClause ?????????????????(it 
listed in detail the names of the criminals accused in the case of Ming Dynasty history)? and the two form 
another discourse structure. The two structures are overlapping, they share one component ?????(a 
court bulletin)?. 
 
2. The static property of Chinese discourse structure 
From the examples in the previous section, we can notice the characteristics of Chinese discourse 
structure: 
(1) A generalized topic and a comment group constitute a discourse structure. A comment group is 
composed of a number of comments. 
(2) A comment can be the part of a PClause that follows the topic, or a whole PClause, or another 
discourse structure. Therefore, the discourse structure is embedded in a recursive way to the 
right. 
Using Context-Free Grammar, the rules are 
? DiscourseStructure?GeneralizedTopic CommentGroup 
? CommentGroup?Comment 
? CommentGroup?Comment CommentGroup 
? Comment?PClauseTail 
? Comment?PClause 
? Comment?DiscourseStructure 
? GeneralizedTopic? 
? PClauseTail? 
? PClause? 
Here PClauseTail is the tail of the PClause where the generalized topic appears. In these rules, ?-? 
are generating rules for discourse structure, comment group and comment respectively. ??? are the 
generating rules for generalized topic, PClause tail and PClauses. The right part of these rules is related to 
terminal symbols and is not listed here. 
Statistics on the corpora show that in genuine Chinese texts, there are a large number of PClauses 
whose subject is missing. This phenomenon is regarded as zero anaphora or elision in traditional language 
study. But as a matter of fact, the nature of this phenomenon is that there is more than one comment that 
corresponds to a topic. Since it is a topic, it is natural that there are a lot of comments. There are pauses 
between the comments and the result is that several PClauses are formed. Neither is this phenomenon zero 
anaphora nor ellipses, but topic sharing. 
Take 1.8 as an example. The following is its generating process (the numbers following the arrow are 
rule ID).  
DiscourseStructure 
??GeneralizedTopic CommentGroup 
????? CommentGroup 
????? Comment CommentGroup 
????? DiscourseStructure CommentGroup 
????? GeneralizedTopic CommentGroup CommentGroup 
????? ?????? CommentGroup CommentGroup 
????? ?????? Comment CommentGroup CommentGroup 
????? ?????? PClauseTail CommentGroup CommentGroup 
????? ?????? ???????????????CommentGroup CommentGroup 
????? ?????? ???????????????Comment CommenrGroup 
????? ?????? ???????????????PClause CommenrGroup 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????CommentGroup 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????Comment CommentGroup 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????PClause CommentGroup 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????????????CommentGroup 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????????????Comment 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
??????????????PClause 
?????  ??????  ?????????????????????????           
???????????????????????? 
This nature describes the internal relations of a discourse structure. Therefore it is termed static 
nature. 
This nature can cover most examples in the preceding section except example 1.9. This is because the 
overlapping type of the discourse structure in the example 1.9 can not be represented by Context-Free 
Grammar. 
 
3. Dynamic Property of Chinese Topic Clause 
3.1. Topic Structure and Topic Clause 
 In this paper, the structure formed by a comment and its topic is called a topic structure. A topic 
structure as comment can be combined with an external topic and form an external topic structure. If the 
topic of a comment is the outmost layer of a discourse structure, it is then called the topic clause. In most 
cases, every PClause corresponds to a topic clause.  
E.g.3.1. (Adopted from the Biology Section of China Encyclopedia) 
c1?????????, (the spawning season of neoceratodus forsteri is quiet long) 
c2              ??? 9?10 ?????(usually September and October are most 
productive period) 
c3        ???(eggs are big) 
c4        ?? 6?7??, (eggs are 6-7 mm in diameter) 
c5          ????, (have gelatinous membrane) 
c6          ????(are not sticky) 
c7        ????????(the eggs are laid among plants) 
c8          ????????(some sink deep in the water) 
Here, the outmost topic is ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)?. 
The topic clause of c1 is c1 itself. The comment is ??????(the spawning season of is quiet 
long)?. 
c2???? 9?10 ????(usually September and October are most productive period)?is a 
comment, and its topic is????(the spawning season)?. The topic structure composed of the two is the 
comment on ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)??therefore ??????????? 9?10????? 
is the topic clause of c2? 
c3???(eggs are big)?is the comment on the topic ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)?. The topic 
clause of c3 is ????????. 
c4??? 6?7 ??(eggs are 6-7 mm in diameter)? is the comment on the topic ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?. The topic clause of c4 is ??????? 6?7???? 
c5?????(have gelatinous membrane)?is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)?. The topic structure 
??????(eggs have gelatinous membrane)? composed of the two is the comment on ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?. And the topic clause of c5 is ???????????? 
c6????(are not sticky)? is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)?. The topic structure ?????
(eggs are not sticky)? composed of the two is the comment on ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)?. And the 
topic clause of c6 is ??????????? 
c7????????(the eggs are laid among plants)? is the comment on the topic ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?. The topic clause of c7 is ?????????????? 
c8????????(some sink deep in the water)?is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)?? The 
topic structure ?????????(eggs some sink deep in the water)? composed of the two is the 
comment on the topic ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)?. And the topic clause of c8 is ????????
??????? 
The purpose of analyzing a PClause sequence is to find out its discourse structure. If the topic clause 
of every PClause is constructed, the topic of each comment at every layer is then found out, and 
consequently the entire discourse structure will be clear. The next section provides an approach to finding 
out the topic clause of PClauses. 
3.2. Stack Model of Dynamic Generation of the Topic Clause  
The topic clause of PClause ci of Ex.3.1 is marked as ci?. They are listed below. 
c1?.?????????, (the spawning season of neoceratodus forsteri is quiet long) 
c2?.?????????? 9?10 ?????(the spawning season of neoceratodus forsteri 
usually September and October are most productive period) 
c3?.???????(neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are big) 
c4?.?????? 6?7??, (neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are 6-7mm in diameter) 
c5?.?????????, (neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs have gelatinous membrane) 
c6?.?????????(neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are not sticky) 
c7?.????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are laid among plants) 
c8?.?????????????(some eggs of neoceratodus forsteri sink deep in the water) 
The generation of each ci? is exemplified below. 
c1?=c1? 
The topic of c2 is ????(the spawning season)? in c1?. Delete the part of c1? right to the topic and 
replace it with c2?and we will have c2?? 
The topic of c3 is ?????(neoceratodus forsteri?)? in c2?. Delete the part of c2? right to the topic 
and replace it with c3?and we will have c3?. 
The topic of c4 is ?????(neoceratodus forsteri?)? in c3?. Delete the part of c3? right to the topic 
and replace it with c4?and we will have c4?. 
The topic of c5 is ??(eggs)? in c4?. Delete the part of c4? right to the topic and replace it with c5?and 
we will have c5?. 
The topic of c6 is ??(eggs)? in c5?. Delete the part of c5? right to the topic and replace it with c6?and 
we will have c6?. 
The topic of c7 is ?????(neoceratodus forsteri?)? in c6?. Delete the part of c6? right to the topic 
and replace it with c7?and we will have c7?. 
The topic of c8 is ??(eggs)? in c7?. Delete the part of c7? right to the topic and replace it with c8?and 
we will have c8?. 
Generally, given a PClause sequence },,{ 1 ncc ? , if the first PClause is a complete structure of 
topic-comment, then 
(1) the topic clause of the first PClause is the PClause itself; 
(2) if the topic of a subsequent PClause is missing, then the topic should be in the topic clause of its 
previous PClause; 
(3) the topic clause of every subsequent PClause can be generated recursively by stack operation. 
Note the topic clause of ic  as ic ??and the topic clause of 1+ic  as 1+ic ?, 
?3.1?if the topic of 1+ic  is missing?and ic ?= ??A ?where A is the topic of 1+ic , then 
1+ic ?= 1+iAc? ? 
?3.2?if the topic of 1+ic  is not missing, then 1+ic ?= 1+ic . 
If we regard the beginning and the end of a topic clause as the bottom and the top of a stack 
respectively, then the removal and connection of the components in the generation process of topic clause 
are typical stack operations. Therefore the recursive law of such generation can be called the stack model 
The stack model can not only applied to embedded discourse structure, but also some overlapping 
structures such as instance 1.4. Details are not given here. Our investigation into corpora (about 340,000 
Chinese characters) of different registers shows that more than 95% PClauses meet the model. 
From the stack model, it can be seen that the key to generate the topic clause of a PClause is to 
identifying which component of the topic clause of the previous PClause is its topic. This would require to 
uncover the constraints for forming the discourse structure.  
 
4. Constraints on Discourse Structure 
4.1. Acceptability and completeness of Topic Clause 
A topic structure is composed of a topic and its comments. Therefore mostly it is acceptable. A topic 
clause is not only acceptable, but also complete with necessary syntactic and semantic components. Taking 
advantage of this nature, the filtering of topic-seeking for a PClause can be boiled down to the judgment of 
the acceptability and completeness of a single clause. For example, the topic clause of PClause 7 in 
example 3.1 is: 
c7?.????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are laid among plants) 
and PClause c8 is  
????????(some sink deep in the water) 
According to the stack model, the options for the topic clause of c8 are: 
?1? ????????(some sink deep in the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is not missing? 
?2? ????????????(neoceratodus forsteri some sink deep in the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is ?????(neoceratodus forsteri)?? 
?3? ?????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some sink deep in the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is ??(eggs)?? 
?4? ???????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laid sink deep in 
the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???(be laid)?? 
?5? ?????????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laid plant 
sink deep in the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???(plant)?? 
?6? ???????????????????(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laid 
among plant sink deep in the water) 
?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???(middle)?? 
Chinese intuition tells us that (1) is not complete, and (4)(5)(6) are not acceptable, so the candidates 
are (2) and (3) only. We see that if we can formalize our intuition, we can considerably narrow down the 
scope of options.  
The topic and the comment of a topic clause are often from different PClauses, and the components in 
a topic clause that have discourse functions (such as discourse conjunctions) can affect the acceptability of 
the topic clause. This problem needs to be addressed in separate study.  
4.2. Semantic Constraints 
E.g. 4.1.??????????????(He bought a wallet, (it) is a brand product.) 
The topic of the second PClause could be ??(he)? or ???(a wallet)?. We can eliminate the first 
possibility by using semantic constraints, because a person can not be a product. 
4.3. Syntactic Constraints 
An investigation into corpora shows that the syntactic relations of the topic and the comments are of 
the following types: 
 (1) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is subject-predicate, then the same 
relation is true of it with its comments in other PClauses (see example 1.3); 
 (2) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is predicate-object, 
preposition-object or attribute-central, then the relation of it and its comment in other PClauses is of the 
same type or subject-predicate type (see example 1.4 and 1.8). 
 (3) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is adverbial-central or 
predicate-complement, then its relation with its comment in other PClauses is the same (see example 1.5, 
1.6 and 1.7). 
 (4) If a component is not the topic of the PClause where it is appears, but is the topic of other 
PClauses, then it must be the object or attribute in the PClause where it appears and its relation with the 
comments in other PClauses is subject-predicate (see example 1.9). 
In addition, adjectives, numbers in partition in respect of quantity and some adverbs (such a adverbs 
indicating degree) cannot function as general topics. 
4.4 Context Constraints 
E.g. 4.2.??????????(He has a friend, (who is)very generous with money.) 
The topic of the second PClause could be ??(he)? or ????(a friend)?. Whether it is ?he is 
generous with money? or ?his friend is generous with money?, it will present no problem either 
semantically or syntactically. However, abundant instances and analyses show that if  
(1) the structure of the topic clause of the previous PClause is SVO; 
(2) the core verb of the topic clause of the previous PClause has a sense of ?owing? or ?introducing?; 
and 
(3) the second PClause is an adjective phrase but does not fall into the category of mental state 
then the topic of the second PClause is the object rather than the subject of the topic clause. 
According to this constraint, the topic of the second PClause is ????(a friend)? 
4.5. Cognition Constraints 
Theoretically, there is no limit to the size of a discourse structure. Countless layers could be 
embedded or overlapped. For example, we could have the following discourse structure. 
E.g. 4.3???????? 3? 
???????? 1? 
                  ??? 4? 
                          ???? 1? 
                                    ???? 5? 
?? 
(The circumference ratio?s  
integer part is 3, 
 the first number in the fraction part is 1,  
           followed by 4, 
             followed by 1, 
                                                   followed by 5  
?) 
Here ????(circumference ratio)?, ?1?, ?4?, ?1?, ?5? all are topics. They could go on with no limit.  
But the study on factual corpora have discovered that the maximum layer of embedding or 
overlapping is 5, and if we shall return from the deeper layers, the maximum number of the layers that can 
be jumped back is 3. This has much to do with people?s cognition ability. The following is an example of 5 
layers of embedding and overlapping with 3 layers of maximum return. The underlined words are the 
generalized topics. The numbers in the brackets to the right of the PClauses indicating the depth of the 
embedding and overlapping. PClause ?????(release them)? reaches the fifth layer in depth, but the 
next PClause ???????(when the authorities started investigating)? returns to layer2, retreating 3 
layers.  
Ex. 4.4. (Adopted from Royal Tramp by Louis Cha)  
???????????????0?(Cheng Weifan, on the long boat journey from Hangzhou to Nanxun) 
  ??????1?(thought things over) 
  ???????1?(had come up with a good plan.) 
  ????????????????1?(thought the book had already been in circulation for some time) 
      ?????????2?(It  was therefore  too  late  for  concealment) 
      ?????????????2?(the  only expedient  left was to play a trick) 
          ????????????3?(on one hand, send people to go to the bookshops all over the country) 
                 ??????????????4? (buy back and then destroy all copies of the book)  
          ????????3?(on the other hand, work day and night) 
              ??????4?(make a new printing mould) 
              ??????????4?(remove all the offensive bits) 
              ??????4?(reprint the book) 
                      ??????5?(release them)  
      ????????2?(when the authorities started investigating) 
          ???????????3?(inspect the new edition of Ming History) 
          ???????????3?(find Wu?s charges to be groundless) 
      ??????????2?(can avert a hideous disaster) 
 
5. Initial Application of Discourse Structure based on General Topic 
5.1. Discourse Structure in Encyclopedia 
The herein discussed Chinese discourse structure based on general topic has been initially applied and 
tested in the analyses of encyclopedia texts. 
The entries in encyclopedia are expository, covering people, places, species, events, devices and 
terms etc. in various subjects. Because the different aspects of an object must be exposed, the leading role 
of the topic is very obvious. It frequently occurs that many PClauses are used to comment on one topic, 
and the comments on different aspects of an object are often presented as embedded or overlapping 
structures. In order to mine the information of the object described, it is necessary to analyze the governing 
scope of a topic. In other words, it is necessary to locate the object commented by every PClause. 
Therefore the discourse structure must be analyzed. Take 3.1 for example, we must be clear about for 
?what? September and October are the active period, the eggs of ?what? are big, the eggs of ?what? are 
6-7 mm in diameter, ?what? has gelatinous membranes and so on. 
5.2. An Experiment on Discourse Structure in Encyclopedia 
The experiment object of the paper is the entries about various fishes in the biology volume of China 
Encyclopedia. The objective is the find the topic clause of every Pclause. 
There are 224 entries about fishes in this volume, each one with a title, viz. the name of the order, 
family, genera and species of a fish. The first PClause in the text does not mention the name, but 
introduces the genera information of it. The name is not necessarily mentioned in later Pclauses. For 
example,   
???? 
Neoceratodus forsteri; Queensland lungfish 
?????????????? 1 ?(????????),???????????????
125 ??,?? 10 ???????????????????? 
(A member of the family Ceratodontidae and order Ceratodontiformes (see picture of Neoceratodus 
forsteri). (It) is the biggest extant lungfish species in the world. (Its)Body length (is) about 125 centimeters, 
(it) weighs as much as 10 kilograms. (Its) Body is elongated, covered with big and thin round scales ?) 
In the experiment, the entry names (both in Chinese and English) and bracketed information are 
deleted. But the entry title is added to the left of the first PClause, connected by a ??(is) ?. For example, 
the first PClause of the above example of neoceratodus forsteri is changed into ???????????
????????? 1???, the rest remains unchanged. 
The experiment selected 3999 PClauses of 86 entries as training data, and 577 PCauses of 13 entries 
as open-test data. The input of the experiment is the topic clause of a PClause and its next PClause, and the 
output is the topic clause of the second PClause. In other words, the target of the experiment is to decide 
the topic of the PClause within a limited scope under the scheme of stack model.  
For the training data, each PClause is replenished manually into a topic clause, and then the words are 
segmented. In this way, the training topic clause set G is obtained. The principle of testing is described 
below. For each tested PClause c and the topic clause d of its proceeding PClause, word segmentation is 
done separately. String d is cut at different places, the tails are replaced with c every time. Thus a number 
of candidate topic clauses of c are obtained. Then the similarity reckoning is made about the candidate 
topic clauses and the topic clauses in G. The one with the maximum similarity is chosen as the result for 
output. 
In order to solve the problem of data sparse in the calculation, semantic generalization is made about 
related words. The semantic categories employed are?subjects of fishes ( e.g. neoceratodus forsteri, 
alopias), part (e.g. head, scale, fin), position (e.g. back, abdomen), location ( e.g. front, upper), shape (e.g. 
fusiformis, cylindrical), size (e.g. big, short), color (e.g. red, light blue). environment (e.g. pond, near sea), 
geographical region(e.g. the Pacific, Huanghai), season(e.g. early spring, autumn), number (e.g. 3, 1-3) etc. 
Verbs are rarely generalized.  
The result of the initial experiment showed the accuracy rate for open test was 78%. If add the title of 
a text to the beginning of every PClause in the text, 66% accuracy rate can be got as a baseline. The result 
of the experiment is not high indeed and there is room for improvement. Since the experiment principle 
was the similarity of the topic clauses, in essence only the stack model and the acceptability of topic clause 
are used. Semantic constraints, syntactic constraints, context constraints and cognitive constraints are not 
employed. In addition, word segmentation is not entirely correct, and the semantic generalization is quite 
rough. 78% accuracy rate of under such rough conditions has initially proved the applicability of the 
theoretical system. 
 
6. Discussion 
 This paper employs discourse structure of topic-comment in analyzing Chinese, takes PClauses as the 
basic discourse unit, and extends the concept of topic to generalized topic. As a result, the properties of 
Chinese discourse structure are proposed. Investigations into large amount of language data have proved 
that this theoretical system is natural and applicable to Chinese, which is also backed up by initial 
experiment. Of course, the theory need to be improved, and the various types of constraints under the 
theory framework need to be further uncovered. More and detailed study needs to be done along this path.
