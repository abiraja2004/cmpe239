ABSTRACT 
A series of experiments on speaker-independent phone recogni- 
tion of continuous peech ave been carried out using the recently 
recorded BREF corpus. These experiments are the first to use this 
large corpus, and are meant to provide abaseline performance eval- 
uation for vocabulary-independent phone recognition of French. 
The HMM-based recognizer was trained with hand-verified ata 
from 43 speakers. Using 35 context-independent phone models, 
a baseline phone accuracy of 60% (no phone grammar) was ob- 
tained on an independent test set of 7635 phone segments from 19 
new speakers. Including phone bigram probabilities as phonotactic 
constraints resulted in a performance of 63.5%. A phone accuracy 
of 68.6% was obtained with 428 context dependent models and 
the bigram phone language model. Vocabulary-independent word 
recognition results with no grammar are also reported for the same 
test data. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper eports on a series of experiments for speaker- 
independent, continuous speech phone recognition of French, 
using the recently recorded BREF corpus\[4, 6\]. BREF 
was designed to provide speech data for the development 
of dictation machines, the evaluation of continuous peech 
recognition systems (both speaker-dependent a d speaker- 
independent), and to provide a large corpus of continuous 
speech to study phonological variations. These experiments 
are the first to use this corpus, and are meant o provide a 
baseline performance evaluation for vocabulary-independent 
(VI) phone recognition, as well as the development of a pro- 
cedure for automatic segmentation a d labeling of the corpus. 
First a brief description of BREF is given, along with the 
procedure for semi-automatic (verified) labeling and auto- 
matic segmentation f the speech data. The ability to accu- 
rately predict he phone labels from the text is assessed, as is 
the accuracy of the automatic segmentation. Next the phone 
recognition experiments performed using speech data from 
62 speakers (43 for training, 19 for test) are described. A hid- 
den Markov model (HMM) based recognizer has beeen eval- 
uated with context-independent (CI) and context-dependent 
(CD) model sets, both with and without a duration model. 
Results are also given with and without the use of 1-gram 
and 2-gram statistics to provide phonotactic constraints. Pre- 
liminary VI word recognition results are presented with no 
grammar. The final section provides a discussion and sum- 
mary, and a comparison of these results to the performance 
of other phone recognizers. 
THE BREF  CORPUS 
BREF is a large read-speech corpus, containing over 100 
hours of speech material, from 120 speakers. The text ma- 
terials were selected verbatim from the French newspaper 
Le Monde, so as to provide a large vocabulary (over 20,000 
words) and a wide range of phonetic environments\[4\]. Con- 
taining 11 i5 distinct diphones and over 17,500 triphones, 
BREF can be used to train VI phonetic models. Hon and 
Lee\[5\] concluded that for VI recognition, the coverage of 
triphones i  crucial. Separate text materials, with similar dis- 
tributionalproperties were selected for training, development 
test, and evaluation purposes. The selected texts consist of 18 
"all phoneme" sentences, and approximately 840 paragraphs, 
3300 short sentences (12.4 words/sentence), and 3800 longer 
sentences (21 words/sentence). The distributional properties 
for the 3 sets of texts, and the combined total, are shown in 
Table 1. The sets are distributionally comparable in terms of 
their coverage of word and subword units and quite similar in 
their phone and diphone distributions. For comparison, the 
last column of the table gives the distributional properties for 
the original text of Le Monde. 
Each of 80 speakers read approximately 10,000 words 
(about 650 sentences) of text, and an additional 40 speakers 
each read about half that amount. The speakers, chosen from 
a subject pool of over 250 persons in the Paris area, were 
paid for their participation. Potential subjects were given 
a short reading test, containing selected sentences from Le 
Monde representative of the type of material to be recorded\[6\] 
and subjects judged to be incapable of the task were not 
recorded. The recordings were made in stereo in a sound- 
isolated room, and were monitored to assure the contents. 
Thus far, 80 training, 20 test, and 20 evaluation speakers have 
been recorded. The number of male and female speakers for 
each subcorpus i given in Table 2. The ages of the speakers 
range from 18 to 73 years, with 75% between the ages of 
20 and 40 years. In these experiments only a subset of the 
training and development test data was used, reserving the 
evaluation data for future use.

Labeling of BREF 
In order to be used effectively for phonetic recognition, 
time-aligned phonetic transcriptions of the utterances in 
BREF are needed. Since hand-transcription of such a large 
amount of data is a formidable task, and inherently subjec- 
tive, an automated procedure for labeling and segmentation 
is being investigated. 
The procedure for providing atime-aiigned broad phonetic 
transcription for an utterance has two steps. First, a text-to- 
phoneme module\[10\] generates the phone sequence from 
the text prompt. The 35 phones (including silence) used 
by the text-to-phoneme system are given in Table 3. Since 
the automatic phone sequence generation can not always 
accurately predict what the speaker said, the transcriptions 
must be verified. The most common errors in translation 
occur with foreign words and names, and acronyms. Other 
mispredictions arise in the reading of dates: for example 
the year "1972" may be spoken as "mille neuf cent soixante 
douze" or as "dix neuf cent soixante douze." In the second 
step, the phone sequence is aligned with the speech signal 
using Viterbi segmentation. 
The training and test sentences used in these experiments 
have been processed automatically and manually verified 
prior to segmentation. 'nae manual verification only cor- 
rected "blatant errors" and did not attempt o make fine- 
phonetic distinctions. Comparing the predicted and verified 
phone strings, 97.5% of the 38,397 phone labels 1 were as- 
sessed to be correct, with an accuracy of 96.6%. However, 
during verification about 67% of the automatically generated 
phone strings were modified. This indicates that verification 
1 Silence segmems were disregarded.

is a necessary step for accurate labeling. The exception dic- 
tionary used by the text-to-phoneme system has been updated 
accordingly to correct some of the prediction errors, thereby 
reducing the work entailed in verification. 
Table 4 summarizes the phone prediction accuracy of the 
text-to-phone translation. 86% of the errors are due to inser- 
tions and deletions by the text-to-phone system. Liaison and 
the pronunciation ofmute-e account for about 70% of these. 
Liaison is almost always optional and thus bard to accurately 
predict. While most speakers are likely to pronounce mute-e 
before apause, it is not always poken. Whether or not mute- 
e is pronounced depends on the context in which it occurs 
and upon the dialect of the speaker. Substitutions account for

only 14% of the errors, with the most common substitutions 
between/z/and/s/, and between/e/and/E/. 
A problem that was unanticipated was that some of the 
French speakers actually pronounced the English words 
present in the text prompt using the correct English 
phonemes, phonemes that do not exist in French. These 
segments were transcribed using the "English phones" listed 
in Table 3, which were added to the 35 phone set. However, 
so few occurrences of these phones were observed that for 
training they were mapped to the "closest" French phone. 
In addition, afew cases were found where what the speaker 
said did not agree with the prompt ext, and the orthographic 
text needed to be modified. These variations were typi- 
cally the insertion or deletion of a single word, and usually 
occurred when the text was almost, but not quite, a very 
common expression. 
Validation of automatic segmentation 
A subset of the training data (roughly 12 minutes of speech, 
from 20 of the training speakers) was manually segmented 
to bootstrap the training and segmentation procedures. In 
order to evaluate the Viterbi segmentation, the phone recog- 
nition accuracy using the manual segmentation for training 
was compared to the recognition accuracy obtained using 
Viterbi resegmentation (3 iterations) on the same subset of 
training data. For this comparison 35 context-independent 
phone models with 8 mixture components and no duration 
model, were used. The recognizer was tested on data from 
11 speakers in the development test speaker set, and the 
averaged results are given in Table 5. The performance is 
estimated by the phone accuracy given by: 1 - (subs + del + 
ins) I correct number of phones. The recognition accuracies 
are seen to be comparable, indicating that, at least for the 
purposes of speech recognition, the Viterbi algorithm can be 
used to segment the BREF corpus once the segment labels 
have been verified. Including a duration model increases the 
phone accuracy to 58.0% with the Viterbi segmentation.

The segmentations determined by the Viterbi algorithm 
have been compared to the manual segmentations ona new 
independent set of test data. To do so the offset in number 
of frames was counted, using the manual segmentation as
the reference. Silence segments were ignored. The test data 
consisted of 115 sentences from 10 speakers (4nff6f) and con- 
talned 6517 segments. 71% of the segment boundaries were 
found to be identical. 91% of the automatically found bound- 
aty locations were within I frame (96% within 2 frames) of 
the hand boundary location. The automatic boundaries were 
located later than the hand location for 23% of the segments, 
and earlier for 5% of the segments. This assyrnmetry may be 
due to the minimum duration imposed by the phone models. 
PHONE RECOGNIT ION EXPERIMENTS 
Phone Recognizer 
The baseline phone recognizer uses a set of 35 CI phone 
models. Each model is a 3-state left-to-right HMM with 
Gaussian mixture observation densities. The 16 kHz speech 
was downsampled by 2 and a 26-dimensional feature vector 
was computed every 10 ms. The feature vector is composed 
of 13 cepstrum coefficients and 13 differential cepstrum co- 
efficients. Duration is modeled with a gamma distribution 
per phone model. As proposed by Rabiner et al\[ll\], the 
HMM and duration parameters are estimated separately and 
combined in the recognition process for the Viterbi search. 
Maximum likelihood estimators were used for the HMM pa- 
rameters and moment estimators for the gamma distributions. 
Data 
The training data consists of approximately 50 minutes 
of speech from 43 training speakers (21m/22f). There are 
33,289 phone segments containing 5961 different riphones. 
Thirty-seven of the sentences are "all-phone" sentences in 
which the text was selected so as to contain all 35 phones\[4\]. 
These sentences are quite long, having on the order of 190 
phones/sentence. The remaining sentences are taken from 
paragraph texts and have about 65 phones/sentence. The test 
data is comprised of 109 sentences spoken by 21 new speak- 
ers (10m/1 If). There are a total of 7635 phone segments (70 
phones/sentence) and 3270 distinct riphones in the test set. 
Phonotactic onstraints 
Phone, diphone and triphone statistics, computed on the 
5 million word original text, are used to provide phonotac- 
tic constraints. Table 6 gives the information stored in the 
Markov sources (1-gram to 3-gram) estimated from the oc- 
currence frequencies on the original text in bits/phone\[4\]. 
For now only the 1-gram and 2-gram constraints have been 
incorporated in the model.

Results 
Table 7 gives recognition results using 35 CI phone models 
with 16 mixture components. Silence segments were not 
included in the computation of the phone accuracy. Results 
are given for different phone language models, both with 
and without a duration model. The improvement obtained 
by including the duration model is relatively small, on the 
order of 0.3% to 0.8 %, probably in part due to the wide 
variation in phone durations across contexts and speakers. 
Each additional order in the language model adds about 2% 
to the phone accuracy. The best phone accuracy is 63.5% 
with the 2-gram language model and duration.

Table 8: Phone recognition results for 428 CD models. 
Table 8 gives recognition results using a set of 428 CD 
phone models\]12\] with 16 mixture components. The mod- 
eled contexts were automatically selected based on their fre- 
quencies in the training data. This model set is essentially 
composed of right-context phone models, with only one- 
fourth of the models being triphone models. Less than 2% 
of the triphones found in the training data can be modeled in 
full. In choosing to model right contexts over left contexts, 
a preference is given to modeling anticipatory coarticulation 
over perservatory coarticulation. 
Including the duration models improves performance a lit- 
tle more than was observed for the CI models. The duration 
models are probably better estimates of the underlying distri- 
bution since the data has less variability due to context. The 
duration models give about a 1% improvement in accuracy 
when used with a I-gram or 2-gram language model. The 
phonotactic constraints, however, have a larger effect with 
the CI models, presumably because the CD models already 
incorporate some to the phonotactic nformation. 
The use of CD models reduces the errors by 14% (com- 
paring the best CI and CD models), which is less than the 
27% error reduction reported by Lee and Hon\[7\]. There are 
several factors that may account for this difference. Most 
importantly, Lee and Hon\[7\] compare 1450 right-CD mod- 
els to 39 CI models, whereas in this study only 428 contexts 
were modeled. In addition, the baseline recognition accuracy 
reported by Lee and Hon is 53.3% with a bigrarn language 
model, compared to our baseline phone accuracy of 63.5%.

Table 9: The most common substitutions with 428 models. 
The most recognition errors occurred for the phones: /E/ 
8.1%,/a/7.6%, let 7.2%, let 4.9%, It/4.3%,and Ix/4.2%, 
accounting for almost 40% of the substitution errors. Of 
these phones only let and/E/have high phone error rates of 
about 40%. Table 9 shows the most frequent substitutions 
made by the recognizer. The two most common confusions 
are reciprocal confusions between let and/E/and between/E/ 
and/a/. Together these account for 13% of the confusions. 
Many speakers do not make a clear distinction between the 
phones/E/and lee/when they occur word-internally, which 
may account for their high confusability. The high number 
of errors for /a /are  probably due to the large amount of 
variability of/a/observed in different contexts. 
14% of the insertions are Irl, followed by 11% for IlL 
These two phones also are deleted the most: 13% of the 
deletions are/1/and 11% Irl. Although/1/and Irl account 
for many of the insertion and deletion errors, the overall 
error rate for these phones are relatively low, 11% and 7%, 
respectively. Improved performance on these phones may be 
achieved by modeling more contexts and by improving their 
duration models.

In Table 10 results are given for a set of 132 CD models. 
The models were selected so as to group phonetically similar 
contexts based on manner of articulation classes. 'nais is 
similar to the approach taken by Deng et al\[2\]. Taking into 
consideration that French is a syllable-based language, left- 
context models were defined for vowels and right-context 
models for consonants. The phone accuracy of 65.2% lies in 
between the recognition accuracies of the CI and CD models. 
WORD RECOGNIT ION EXPERIMENTS 
Two types of implementation are usually considered to 
recognize words based on phone models. In the first solu- 
347 
tion, which can be called integretated approach, an HMM is 
generated for each word by concatenating the phone models 
according to the phone transcriptions. The word models are 
put together to represent the entire lexicon with one large 
HMM. The recognition process is then performed for exam- 
ple by using the Viterbi decoding algorithm. The second 
solution uses the output of the phone recognizer as an in- 
termediary level of coding such that the lexical decoding is 
derived only from this ouput. Phonological rules may be 
included in the lexical decoding, or alternatively may be rep- 
resented directly in the lexical entries. The phone recognizer 
output is usually a phone weillis including phone hypotheses 
for each of the associated speech segments and their corre- 
sponding likelihoods. If the fist  approach appears to offer a 
more optimal solution to the decoding problem by avoiding 
an intermediary coding, the second approach greatly reduces 
the computional requirements of the acoustic level which is 
independent of the lexicon size and offers a solution to handle 
out of lexicon words. 
Since our goal is to build a system capable of recognizing 
at least 20,000 words, the second solution is attractive since it 
allows us to develop and evaluate lexical and language mod- 
els without interaction with the acoustic level. In particular, 
this approach is of interest as it permits us to more easily 
study problems like liaison which are specific to the French 
language. However, in order to obtain preliminary results 
on word recognition using BREF, we have chosen to use the 
integrated approach, primarily because the phone recognizer 
does not at this time provide a phone trellis. In doing so we 
have represented liaison in the lexicon by providing alternate 
pronunciations. 
Table 11: VI word recognition results (no grammar). 
Lexicon 
1K 
Vocabulary-independent word recognition experiments 
were run using four different lexicons. The smaller lexi- 
con (1K lexicon) contains 1139 orthographic words, only 
those words found in the test sentences. The 3K lexicon con- 
tains all the words found in the training and test sentences, a 
total of 2716 words. The 5K and 10K lexicons include all the 
words in the test data complemented with the most common 
words in the original text. These two lexicons contain re- 
spectively 4863 and 1051 1 words. Alternate pronunciations 
increase the number of phonemic forms in the lexicon by 
about 10%. The word recognition results with no grammar 
are given in Table 11. Since no grammar is used, single word 
homophone confusions are not counted as errors. 
Homophones present a large problem for French. If the 
Corr: 
73.4 
homophone errors are included the phone accuracies drop by 
about 10%. A lexical study with 300,000 words found that 
there can be over 30 words with the same pronunciation[l]. 
In the Le Monde text corpus of 4.2 million words, there 
were 92,185 orthographically distinct words, but only 63,981 
phonemidly distinct words, giving a homophone rate of 
about 30%. In the 1K and 3K lexicons the homophone rate 
is lower, on the order of 15%. The "worst-case" homophone 
in the 3K lexicon is for the phonemic word /sA/, which may 
correspond to any of the 7 following orthographic words: 
100, cent, cents, s'en, sang, sans, sent. For comparison, 
there are roughly 3% homophones in RM, less than 2% for 
TIMIT, and less than 5% in the MIT Pocket lexicon. 
While the large number of word homophones in French 
presents its problems, more complicated homophone prob- 
lems exist, where sequences of words form homophones. 
The example in Figure 1 shows some of the homophones for 
the phonetic sequence /parle/ for the words in the 3K lexicon. 
These multiple word homophones account for a few percent 
of the errors in Table 11. In fluent speech, the problems are 
more complicated as illustrated by Figure 2. While nomi- 
nally the phonetic transcription of the word "adolescence" is 
/adclEsAs/, the realized pronunciation is /adxlEsAs/, having

the complexity of the problem and the power of the syntac-

over 300,000 entries yields 340 possible word segmentations. 
This expands to over 2 million possible phrases when all the 
combinations are considered. Syntactic constraints includ- 
ing form agreement reduce the set to 6 possibilities, all of 
which are semantically plausible.

D ISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 
These preliminary experiments have set a baseUne perfor- 
mance for phone recognition using BREF. The preliminary 
results are somewhat comparable to those obtained for En- 
glish using the TIMIT corpus. Lee and Hon\[7\] report 53% 
accuracy (66% correct) for 39 CI models and 66% accuracy 
(74% correct) using 1450 right-CD models. Digalakis et 
al.\[3\] report 64% (70% correct) accuracy using CI models 
with a 39-phone symbol set. Levinson et a1.\[8\] report 52% 
phone recognition with 12% insertions, and do not specify 
the number of deletions. Phone recognition rates reported 
for French by Merialdo\[9\] for speaker-dependent (4 speak- 
ers) recognition of isolated syllables were 80.6% accuracy 
(84.4% correct). 
We have taken a first step at vocabulary-independent word 
recognition using 1K to 10K word lexicons with no grammar. 
The word accuracy falls from 69% to 49% when the lexicon 
size increases from 1K to 10K. While these experiments are 
preliminary, they have given us insight into the problems en- 
countered in lexical access, particularly the difficulties found 
with single-word and multiple-word homophones, and with 
liaison. 
A procedure for automatic segmentation a d labeling of 
the BREF corpus is being developed. The preliminary inves- 
tigations indicate that the main problems lie in predicting the 
phone string, and that while the segmentation is not exact, the 
vast majority of segment boundaries are located within the 
same frame as a hand-segmentation. However, it is expected 
that more accurate segmentations will be obtained by using 
CD models for segmentation. In addition, a smaller frame 
step will be used to provide a finer segmentation. 
Text-to-phone prediction can be improved by including 
difficult items, such as foreign words and acronyums, in the 
exception dictionary. This will not, however, eliminate the 
need for verification, as it will not handle alternate pronun- 
ciations. One option is to have the text-to-phoneme system 
propose alternate pronunciations for dates and acronyms, 
and to allow liaison and the pronunciation of mute-e to be 
optional. In addition, providing a means of flagging poor 
matches would greatly ease the process of verification. 
An HMM-based recognizer has been used for a baseline 
performance evaluation and verification of the data. In the 
future better acoustic phone models and duration models will 
be used. The improvement observed using the sets of CD 
models indicates, at least with these preliminary experiments, 
that the improvement appears to be related to the number of 
CD models that can be trained. We expect to obtain improved 
phone recognition performance by using more of the training 
data as only a small portion of the BREF corpus has been 
used.
