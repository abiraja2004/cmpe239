Feature Structures, Unification and Finite-State Transducers

We present a new framework for describing morphological models which combines several types of 
descriptions in a single unified declarative language: simple morphological rules relate strings to 
feature structures; rules can be grouped into inheritance hierarchies of paradignm; rules can be 
composed for describing simple agglutinative morphology; they can also be combined to describe 
more complex morphotactic structures. Rules are compiled as extended finite.state ransducers 
where left projections are characters and right projections are feature structures: unification is used 
instead of concatenation t  compute he output of a transduedon. 
I Introduction 
Language-related work at NMSU/CRL focuses today on the development of linguistic processing models 
for a large variety of languages with a realistic overage and with limited resources. In our research projects, 
it is not realistic to spend more than six months to develop an adequate morphological grammar for a given 
language, and we very clearly feel the need for higher level descriptive devices, even more so since some of 
the linguists who are working on the particular have little computational background. In this paper, we 
describe a new framework for the specification of morphological models, the Samba language, which 
combines, in a unified declarative framework, several types of descriptions allowing for the specification of: 
? simple affixations and infixations on a stem using regular expressions on character strings and typed 
feature structures for specifying morphological properties associated with a string pattern; 
? paradigmatic morphology using tables of rules, themselves organized in an inheritance hierarchy. 
? agglutination of affixes by prefixation or suffixadon by simple (binary) composition of rules (or 
tables) and affixes. 
? complex morphotactics byusing regular expressions ofrules (or tables). 
Work on languages with complex morphology such as Arabic, Korean or Turkish shows that the difficulty in 
developing a computational model of morphology has been often underestimated. In many NLP  systems, the 
morphological analyzer is often implemented directly in some programming language such as C. One reason 
can be the lack of a general declarative formalism powerful enough to describe complex morphological 
models; another reason can be that powerful formalisms are often complex and difficult to learn: the direct 
use of a general programming language might require less effort in the development of a morphological 
analyzer. This has, for example, been the case at the Computing Research Laboratory, where morphological 
analyzers for Arabic, Spanish, Russian and Serbo-Croatian were developed using C, Lisp or Prolog for the 
lack of a system that would be sufficiently easy to learn and would match the intuition of linguists about the 
structure of a morphological model (Sheremetyeva et al 97). In particular, as noted by (Anick & Artemieff 
92), many formalisms derived from the two-level model (Koskenniemi 83) concentrate on orthographic and 
affixation rules, whereas a large part of the morphological description of languages such as Spanish or 
Serbo-Croatian focus on capturing regularities between and within paradigms. Two-level formalisms are 
also difficult to use to describe complex affixation or infixation phenomena (Oflazer 93, Beesley et al 89, 
Kiraz 94). There are however formalisms which are explicitly based on the notion of paradigm. For example, 
in the Morfogen system (Pentheroudalds & Higginbotham 91), the basic unit of description is a paradigm 
defined as a set of tables which describe the different inflectional patterns of words. The system described in 
(Anick & Artemieff 92) is based on the same ideas within a more declarative framework. Declarative

systems based on string unification such as the one described by (Calder 89) are also very attractive but more 
difficult to implement; hey also lack the power to describe complex affixation phenomena as well as 
morphotactics in a simple way. 
The work described in this paper can also be related to the first efforts in building generic unification-based 
parsing systems uch as D-PATR (Karttunen 86). Earlier parsing systems where built using (augmented) 
context-free parsers: the grammar was a pure context-free grammar sometimes augmented with attributes or 
actions. The output of an analysis was a derivation tree with property value.~ on the nodes. In unification- 
based parsing system, the backbone is still a context-free parser, but rules are augmented using feature 
structures and equations over feature structures and the output is a feature structure. By comparison, many 
current morphological systems are based on finite-state t chnology, and the most popular ones use some 
version of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi 83) which is based on finite-state transduction: left 
projections are characters and right projections are also characters. In Samba, we depart from this basic 
model, and in a way similar to unification-based parsers, we retain the finite-state backbone, but instead of 
using characters in the right projection, we use feature structures, and instead of using concatenation to build 
the output of the transducer, we use unification on feature structures: the output of the transducer is a feature 
structure, not a string of characters. 
We face, of course, the same efficiency issues that were raised for unification-based parsers, and techniques 
developed for unification-based parsers for dealing with these issues can be adapted to our morphological 
system. It is clear that such a system will be outperformed bytraditional finite-state ransducers in the same 
way that unification-based parsers are outperformed bysimpler context-free parsers. However, we hope that 
the finite-state backbone will help in keeping runtime performances at a reasonable l vel, and we believe that 
a unification-based morphological system will bring us the same benefits that were sought from unification- 
based parsers: declarativity and concise formulation of linguistic knowledge. The initial implementation 
provides an interpreted mode only which is necessary for debugging the morphological model. It also makes 
it easier to implement and debug the Samba system itself. This choice does not preclude acompiled mode 
which will be necessary for building realistic applications. 
There have been several proposals to integrate feature structures and finite-state models for morphology 
which have been sources of inspiration for our work. Calder 0988) and Bird 0992) first suggested the use 
of feature structures to describe morphological models. Trost and Matiasek 0994) integrate an augmented 
two-level model (X2.MorF) in a unification-based system written in Prolog. Krieger et al (1994.) suggest an 
encoding of morphophonemics and morphotactics u ing feature structures to represent finite-state machines 
and use unification on feature structures toimplement operations on finite-state machines (intersection, etc.). 
Our work concentrates on the definition of a high-level descriptive language for morphology based on 
regular expressions, feature structures and inheritance, and on an implementation of a parsing and 
generation system allowing for rapid development of formal morphological models in the spirit of (Carter 
1995).

2 The Samba language 
Paradigmatic inflectional morphology 
The basic element of a morphological description is a morphological rule which associates a form 
representing a sequence of morphemes toa linguistic structure, a set of morphological features. The form 
itself is formally represented asa regular expression on characters. The linguistic structure describes how 
the morphological features of the stem and the morpheme are combined. For example, the following rule 
describes the conjugation of a French verb belonging to the paradigm Chanter in the first person singular of 
102 
the indicative present ense (string variables are prefixed with the dollar sign, regular expressions are 
enclosed between angle brackets): 
\[form: <$chant 'e'>, /* A simple suffixation */ 
structure: \[infl: Chanter, /* Paradigm of the stem */ 
stem: <$chant>, /* Form of the stem */ 
tense: Present, mood: Ind, /* Conjugation information */ 
num: Sing, pets: First\]\] /* Morpheme information */ 
A Samba morphological rule describes the concatenation of stems and morphemes (using regular 
expressions) and the combination of morphological features of words and morphemes (using feature 
structures and unification). Stems and their features are stored in the lexicon: a lexicon entry is a feature 
structure, and the s t ructure  zone in a rule is a partial description of an entry. In the example above, the 
s t ructure  describes a set of words which belong to the inflectional paradigm Chanter ( in f l  feature). 
The stem of the verb is specified under the feature stem as the string variable $chant and this variable is 
used in the regular expression describing the inflected form. l The other features inthe structure ncode the 
morphological properties of this particular form by specifying values for tense, mood, number and person. 
Rules can be grouped together in tables describing forms that belong to the same paradigm. A table is 
simply a disjunction of rules which share some common information: W'I_ER below is an example of a 
table for a sample of French verb morphology 2 which matches ~aditional descriptions given in French 
grammar books. Formally, a table is defined as follows, using the language of feature structures: 
TableId = \[paradigm: <paradigm>, features: <features>, rules: <rules>\]; 
The paradigm feature structure defines the sub-set of lexical entries which belong to the paradigm thus 
defined. The paradigm described in table VPIER (Present Indicative for -er verbs) below is reduced to two 
features and specifies both the morphological inflectional paradigm of the verbs and their stems. For 
example, the verb 'ajouter', which belongs to the 'chanter' paradigm, will have \[stem: 'a jout '  l in the 
dictionary and the table simply refers to the value of this stem using the $chant variable. The second 
feature structure under features  specifies the set of morphological features (tense, mood, mode, etc.) that 
is associated to the conjugation table as a whole: it represents he common contribution of all rules of the 
table. The.successful application of a rule will add (unify) this structure to the output feature structure. The 
rules in the table are grouped under the ru les  feature where each rule is named individually. A rule needs 
only to specify its own particular contribution. The following morphological table defines a set of rules 
which describe a conjugation of French verbs of the first group (i.e., the Chanter paradigm) as 
concatenations of a stem and suffixes. 
VPIER = 
\[paradigm: 
features: 
rules: 
\[sgl: 
sg2: 
sg3: 
pll: 
p12: 
pl3: 
\[infl: Chanter, stem: <$chant>\], 
\[tense: Present, mood: Ind\], 
\[form: <$chant 'e'>, structure: \[num: Sing, pers: First\]\], 
\[form: <$chant 'es'>, structure: \[num: Sing, pers: Second\]\], 
\[form: <$chant 'e'>, structure: \[num: Sing, pers: Third\]\],, 
\[form: <$chant 'ons'>, structure: \[hum: Plu, pers: First\]\], 
\[form: <$chant 'ez'>, structure: \[num: Plu, pers: Second\]\], 
\[form: <$chant 'ent'>, structure: \[num: Plu, pets: Third\]\]\]\]; 
i. This is a simplified example. In most cases, the stem is derived from the citation form and the relation between the 
citation form and the stem will be expressed using regular expressions with variables ( ee below). 
2. Examples are adapted from (Pentheroudakis and Higginbotham 91). 
103 
The above examples use only suffucation, but a form is a full regular expression and allows us to express 
prefixation and infixation as well as suf~ation. As an example of a combination of prefixation and 
suffixation, German past participles in the 'leben' paradigm ('gelebt') can be analyzed as follows: 
VPP LEB = /* A table with a single rule */ 
\[paradigm: \[infl: Leben, stem: <$1eb>\], 
rules: \[PP: \[form: <'ge' $1eb 't'>, structure: PastParticiple\]\]\]\]; 
Agglutinative morphology 
Agglutinative morphology can be described using composed tables that combine descriptions of other 
tables. Simple tables describe inflections on stems tored in the lexicon (as described above); composed 
tables describe further inflections on a form described in other tables, simple or composed. Besides 
composed tables, one can also use regular expressions (on morphological rules or tables) to describe more 
complex structures. Table composition and regular expressions allow for simple descriptions of agglutinative 
morphology as well as derivational morphology (when derivational morphology is based on prefixation or 
suffixation). However, the formalism forbids the type of recursion that would make the formalism truly 
context-free. Incomposed tables, the base table used in the composition issupplied in the base declaration: 
it has the same structure as a morphological rule with form and s t ruc ture  features: ,
TableId = \[base: \[<form>, <structure>\], <rules>\]; 
The base feature holds the result of the application of the rules of the base table: the form holds the form of 
the word as described in the base table, and the s t ruc ture  holds the corresponding partially specified 
feature structure. The definitions below are an example of an analysis for French participles: the two first 
tables are composed tables; the third is a regular expression (a simple disjunction i  this case), and the last 
two are simple tables. 
VPAGN= 
\[base: VPAG\[form: <$vpa>\], 
rules:'\[sing: \[form: <$vpa ''>, structure: \[num: Sing\]\], 
plu: \[form: <$vpa 's'>, structure: \[num: Plu\]\]\]\]; 
VPAG = 
\[base: VPA_EIR\[form: <$vpa>\], 
rules: \[masc: \[form: <$vpa ''>, structure; \[gen: Masc\]\], 
fem: \[form: <$vpa 'e'>, structure: \[gen: Fem\]\]\]\]; 
VPA_EIR = <VPA-ER I VPA-IR>; 
VPAER = 
\[paradigm: \[infl: Chanter, stem0:" <$chant0>\], 
rules: \[presPart: \[form: <$chant0 'ant'>, \[structure: PresentParticiple\]\], 
pastPart: \[form: <$chant0 'e'>, \[structure: PastParticiple\]\]\]\]; 
VPA IR  = 
\[paradigm: \[infl: Finir, stem0: <$fin0>\],

3 Transduction in Samba 
A Samba grammar is composed of a set of definitions of rules, tables or regular expressions over rules or 
tables. A set of definitions i compiled as a finite-state ransducer where the lower part of the transduction 
(left projection) is a siring and the higher part (fight projection) is a feature structure. In such a finite-state 
machine, an edge carries astring (input) and a feature structure (output). From an analysis point of view, the 
inflected form is decomposed into lexemes and morphemes by traversing the network using the left 
projection, as in standard finite-state ransducers. However, instead of simply concatenating the symbol of 
the right projection to build the output, the transducer uses the fight projection to build a single feature 
structure by using unification instead of concatenation. For each edge traversed, the transducer unifies each 
fight projection with the output feature structure: the structural contribution of each morpheme or lexeme is 
added to the word structure by unifying in the feature structure representing the morpheme. From a 
generation point of view, the network is traversed based on the fight projection using feature unification 
instead of symbol equality, and concatenating the suing elements of the left projection to build the inflected 
word form. 
Formally, a Samba transducer T is a tuple (I, 0, S, s, F, 6) where I is the input alphabet, O the output 
alphabet, Sis a finite set of states, s is the initial state, F is a set of final states, 8 is the transition function 
from S x I x O to S. The input alphabet I is a (finite) set of characters. The output alphabet O is an (infinite) 
set of typed feature structures specified by a set of type definitions (Zajac 92). The compilation of a set of 
Samba definitions as a transducer is done in four major successive steps: 
1. All tables are expanded as disjunctions of simple morphological rules. This step transforms all 
Samba table definitions as definitions which have regular expressions on morphological rules as 
fight-hand sides: the leaves of the regular expression trees are morphological roles. 
2. In all Samba definitions, all morphological rules are then compiled as finite-state transducers 
producing regular expression trees where leaves are FSTs. 
3. These regular expressions are compiled as finite-state ransducers where the leaves of the regular 
expressions becomes sub-FSTs. 
4. In a definition, all references to other definitions are then replaced with the corresponding FSTs 
(this process terminates since recursion is not allowed). 
Rules and dictionary entries 
A morphological rule is a pair <f, s> where the form f is a regular expression on characters (the left 
projection) and the structure s is a typed feature structure (the fight projection). It is compiled in an FST M 
in two steps. First, theformfis compiled as a finite-state ransducer M 1 where all fight projections are empty 
(the empty feature structure Y is the top of the lattice of feature structures). Then, from the (single) final state 
105 
f! of this intermediary FST, we add one more epsilon-transition to the final state f of M where the right 
projection is the feature structure s (transition f/s). The initial state i of M is the initial state i I of MI: 
In the form of a rule, there will usually be siring variables that are also present in the structure of the rule. 
Typically, the structure will specify the value of a stem and this variable will be used in the definition of the 
form. We impose the following restrictions on variables: 
1. String variables in the structure refer to string values in a dictionary entry. 
2. Any variable in the regular expression defining the form must also appear in the structure. 
These constraints are imposed in order to guaranty finiteness of substitutions. With these constraints, the 
compilation of a rule is done as follows. First, all string variables in the structure are instantiated by 
querying the dictionary for all entries ubsumed by the structure. Then,, the occurrences of the variables in 
the form are replaced with FSTs representing these strings. For example, the following rule: 
\[form: <$chant 'e'>, 
structure: \[infl: Chanter, 
stem: <$chant>, 
tense: Present, mood: Ind, 
num: Sing, pets: First\]\] 
will be compiled as the FST pictured below. The variable $chant is instantiated byquerying the dictionary 
for all entries ubsumed by the structure: this produces a disjunction of pairs {<~, si> I.~ is a string (stem), si 
is a dictionary entry }. This disjunction iscompiled as the sub-FST chant: 
\[infl: Chanter, 
stem: <$chant>, 
tense: Present, mood: Ind, 
num: SAng, pers: First\] 
Tables 
Tables are expanded as disjunctions of simple morphological rules. This step reformulates all Samba table 
definitions as regular expressions on morphological rules. A disjunction of morphological rules is simply a 
set {~.~, si> } of morphological rules. A simple table is a triple <~, F, {<~, si>}>, where P is the paradigm (a 
feature structure), F represents he features of the table, and {<~, si>} the set of rules. The compilation of a 
simple table rewrites the table as a set of rules: 
<~, F,, {<j~, S/>}> -") { ~i, PAFAsi> }

where P ^ F ^ s i is the unification of the feature structures P, F and si. The Samba compiler makes ure that 
the unification succeeds during the type checking phase of the compilation process. 
A composed table is a pair < ~, s>, {<~, si>} >, where <f, s> is the base and {'9~, si>} the set of rules. The 
compilation of a composed table rewrite the table as a set rules: 
< <~, s>, {<fi, si>}>--* { <f@fi, s^si> } 
wheref @)~ is the composition of the two regular expressions and s ^  s i is the unification between the two 
feature structures. The compiler cheeks that the intersections are not empty and that the unifications are 
successful. The composition f@)~ is computed as follows. We impose constraints on variables similar to the 
one for rules: the form of the base f is  a string variable and this variable must appear in each form fi of the 
roles of the composed table. Each regular expression 3~ is compiled as an FST, and each occurrence of the 
variable f in  rules is replaced with the corresponding sub-FST: the base table is a sub-FST of the composed 
FST as shown in the example below. 
VPAG._N = 
\[base: VPA._G\[form: Svpa\], 
rules: \[plu: \[form: <$vpa 's'>, structure: \[num: Plulll\] 
\[num." Plu\] 
Regular expr'~,~osions 
All Samba definitions which are regular expressions on rules are compiled as finite-state transducers as 
follows (we use standard construction algorithms, ee e.g., Hopcroft & Ullman 79): 
? The concatenation f two morphological rules is simply defined as the rule whose form is the 
concatenation f the forms of the two rules and whose structure is the unification of the structures: 
<fl, sl > ?<f2, S2>"-~<fl "f2, Sl ^ s2>" 
? The Kleene closure is defined as <f, s >* --~ <f*, s >. 
? The disjunction follows the standard construction: <fl ,  sl > I <f2, s2 > is compiled as: 
When a regular expression contains an identifier which stands for a Samba definition, the identifier is 
replaced with its compiled efinition, exactly like in macro-expansion. Since recursivity isnot allowed, this 
process terminates, producing a single FST which is defined as a composition of sub-FSTs. 
107 
The Samba interpreter 
The Samba interpreter takes as input either a string (for analysis), or a feature structure (for generation). The 
interpreter isparametrized by the start state, specified by the user as the identifier of some Samba definition. 
The interpreter exits in the corresponding final state. This facility allows us to debug a Samba grammar 
definition by definition. 
The Samba interpreter in analysis mode works as a standard finite-state transducer: input is read one 
character at a time. The main difference with classical FSTs is that the output of a transition is not appended 
to the output string; instead, the output of a transition (right projection) is unified with the output of the 
transducer: the transducer's output is initialized to the empty feature structure (top of the lattice of feature 
structures) instead of the empty siring. Since unification can fail, a transition is traversed successfully only if 
the transition input (left projection) matches the current character input and if the unification of the 
transition output with the transducer's output succeeds. Traversing the graph of transitions, the right 
projection of each transition is unified with the global transducer's output. When reaching a final state, the 
output has accumulated all information defined in the right projection of each transition. For generation, the 
interpreter simply reverses the interpretation f input and output on transitions: when traversing a transition, 
the interpreter first unifies the input with the transition's right projection. If unification succeeds, it appends 
the transition's left projection to the output string and proceeds with the new input feature structure. 
Since the transducer is non-deterministic, alternative branches must all be explored. Several 
implementations of the search are possible. For parsing, we use a variant of the algorithm for computing the 
intersection of two finite-state machines: the input word is represented as a linear finite-state machine and 
the output is also represented as a finite-state machine with a tree-like topology. The parsing algorithm 
computes the intersection of the transducer and the input word using the left projections of the transducer; 
during traversal, right projections are unified with the output. The unification algorithm for feature structures 
uses structure sharing (see e.g., Emele 91) which allows to minimize the amount of copying: the feature 
structures in various branches of the output graph record exactly the increment of information added by the 
corresponding transitions of the Wansducer. 
4 Conclusion 
Preliminary research in the morphological description of Arabic, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and Japanese 
using the Samba language supports our hypothesis that this formalism can be used for describing a variety of 
morphological models in a compact and declarative way. A mock-up of a Samba interpreter has been built to 
test various implementation choices and a complete implementation is currently under way at CRL. Future 
work on Samba will include the implementation f a version supporting dynamic access to dictionaries, the 
addition of orthographic rules, and an extension to handle composition. The Samba language is currently 
-used to develop a morphological nalyzer for Persian and will also be used for several other languages 
including for example Spanish and Korean.
