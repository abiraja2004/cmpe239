Syntact i c  ana lys i s  - in  our  te rms - means to  const ruct  
a descr ip t ion  o f  the  syntact i c  s t ruc tures  o f  a g iven  sentence ,  
s ta r t ing  f rom a fo rmal  descr ip t ion  o f  the  syntact i c  features  
o f  . the  word fo~ ( the  - resu l t  o f  a p reced ing  word form ane . lys l s ) .  
The descr ip t ion  o f  the  syntact i c  s t ruc ture  as  we l l  as  the  
fo rmal  descr ip t ion  o f  the  wordfo~ms have  to  fo l low a cer ta in  
mode l ,  in  our  case  the  Dependency  Gre~nme~ by ~NZE (1975)o  
A cent ra l  po in t  o f  the  mode l  - in  respect  4o ana lys i s  
- ere  the  so -ca l led  bund les .  They represent  the  necessary  
syntact i c  knowledge o f  a language wh ich  i s  the  base  fo r  ana l -  
ys i~ sentences  o f  th i s  le~guage.  The bund les  ere par ts  o f  
t rees  in  a very  genera l i zed  fo rm.  I f

i s  a bund le ,  then  i t  means ,  that  there  are  cond i t ions  fo r  the  
nodes  NO, N 1, N2, N 3,  that  there  are  re la t ions  between the  ? 
nodes  expressed  by  the  edses  and  the i r  mark ings  R 1 , ~ ,  R 3 
and  that  there  i s  some order  cond i t ion  fo r  the  nodes ,  in  the  
example  1; 1 N 2 N O N 3 .  Fo l low ing  the  mode l ,  these  bund les  g ive  
us  a h igh  measure  o f  surety ,  fo r  the  ana lys i s .

The bund les  a re  s to red  in  the  sys tem in  a very  concent r -  
a ted  fo rm.  For  example fo r  a noun group  w i th  a noun l i ke  " tab-  
le"  a t  the  top  there  i s  on ly  one bud le  w i th  a l l  poss ib le  
facu l ta t ive  nodes .  So we have in  a bund le  in fo rmat ions  about  
the  mode o f  occur rence  o f  a node ,  i .e .  i f  a node i s  ob l igatory ,  
facu l ta t ive  e tc .  
The bund les  serve  a l so  as  descr ip t ion  fo r  the  dominance 
behav iour  o f  word forms (one par t  o f  the  fo rmal  descr ip t ion  
o f  the i r  features ) ,  thus  we have a s t rong  connect ion  between 
a bund le  and a word formwhich  can"s tand"  a t  the  top  o f  the  
bund le .  For  th i s  purpose  ~he bund les  have a spec ia l  ex terna l  
shape  fo r  l ingu is t i c  work.  For  ins tance ,  a f in i te  verb  fo rm 
o f  the  German verb  Sschre iben"  has  severa l  bund les  in  i t s  
dominance component ,  one o f  these  i s

Free modifications llke local and temporal circumstances 
are possible as well. 
Of course, in the syntactic analysis system the bundles 
have  another  shape  and~they  conta in  more ln fo rmat ione  
There are  two poss ib i l i t i es  to  use  the  bund les  fo r  syn-  
tac t i c  ana lys i s ,  the  f i r s t  one i s  to  use  them as  proper  ru les ,  
the  eeco~ one i s  to  use  o ther  methods ,  but  to  have the  bund l -  
es  as  syntact i c  knowledge in  the  back@round. The f i r s t  poss ib -

where 
bottom-up and mul t ip le -path  analys?8.  But fo r  a working 
system we in tend  to fo l low the second way. 
In  the paper a shor t  summary of  the system wi l l  be g iven .  
The syntact i c  analysts ,  o f  a sentence  ~?ven by the formal de-  
sc r ip t ion  of  the syntact i c  features  of  the  wordforms iS  made 
by three  s teps .  These three  s teps  d i f fe r  one from the  o ther  
by d~f ferent  methods. 
In  the f i r s t  s tep  an nau~nented t rans i t ion  network n
(ATe) i s  used to const ruc t  a rough s t ruc ture  o f  the sentence .  
The second s tep  uses the bundles which are members of  t he 
dominance component of  the wordforms to  f ind  out so -ca l led  
subord lnnt ion  poss ib l l i t i ee .  The resu l t  o f  the  second s tep  i s  
a loop- f ree  ~raph, which i s  t rans formed ur?ng the th i rd  s tep  
to  a ~aph contus ing  the dependency treem which desor?be the  
syntact i c  s t ruc tures  of  the an~yeed sentence .  In  the th i rd  
s tep  the cond i t ions  of  the bundles (ob l igator7  and facu l ta t ive  
nodes e tc . )  are  used as we l l  as the condlttonm com?n~ from 
the  shape of  the resu l t ing  graph.  
Up to now we ~re on ly  at  the  be~nn~ng of  the  ~nplement-  
a t ion  o f  the system. 3ome remake about these  problems am 
we l l  as about the d i f f i cu l t ies  to  inc lude  the ana lys i s  o f  
coordtnated  sentences  w~l l  be made in  the paper  too .
