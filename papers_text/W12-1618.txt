1 Overview
This demonstration highlights some emerging ca-
pabilities for incremental speech understanding and
processing in virtual human dialogue systems. This
work is part of an ongoing effort that aims to en-
able realistic spoken dialogue with virtual humans in
multi-party negotiation scenarios (Plu?ss et al, 2011;
Traum et al, 2008). In these negotiation scenarios,
ideally the virtual humans should demonstrate fluid
turn-taking, complex reasoning, and appropriate re-
sponses based on factors like trust and emotions. An
important component in achieving this naturalistic
behavior is for the virtual humans to begin to un-
derstand and in some cases respond in real time to
users? speech, as the users are speaking (DeVault
et al, 2011b). These responses could include rel-
atively straightforward turn management behaviors,
like having a virtual human recognize when it is be-
ing addressed and turn to look at the user. They
could also include more complex responses such as
emotional reactions to what users are saying.
Our demonstration is set in an implemented ne-
gotiation domain (Plu?ss et al, 2011) in which two
virtual humans, Utah and Harmony (pictured in Fig-
ure 1), talk with two human negotiation trainees,
who play the roles of Ranger and Deputy. The di-
alogue takes place inside a saloon in an American
town in the Old West. In this scenario, the goal of the
two human role players is to convince Utah and Har-
mony that Utah, who is currently the local bartender,
should take on the job of town sheriff. We presented
a substantially similar demonstration of this scenario
in (DeVault and Traum, 2012).

To support more natural behavior in such negotia-
tion scenarios, we have developed an approach to in-
cremental speech understanding. The understanding
models are trained using a corpus of in-domain spo-
ken utterances, including both paraphrases selected
and spoken by system developers, as well as spo-
ken utterances from user testing sessions (DeVault
et al, 2011b). Every utterance in the corpus is an-
notated with an utterance meaning, which is repre-
sented using a frame. Each frame is an attribute-
value matrix (AVM), where the attributes and val-
ues represent semantic information that is linked to
a domain-specific ontology and task model (Traum,
2003; Hartholt et al, 2008; Plu?ss et al, 2011). The
AVMs are linearized, using a path-value notation, as
seen at the lower left in Figure 2. Our framework
uses this corpus to train two data-driven models, one
for incremental natural language understanding, and
a second for incremental confidence modeling. We
briefly summarize these two models here; for addi-
tional details and motivation for this framework, and
discussion of alternative approaches, see (DeVault et
al., 2011b; DeVault et al, 2011a).
The first step is to train a predictive incremental
understanding model. This model is based on maxi-
131
mum entropy classification, and treats entire individ-
ual frames as output classes, with input features ex-
tracted from partial ASR results, calculated in incre-
ments of 200 milliseconds (DeVault et al, 2011b).
Each partial ASR result serves as an incremental in-
put to NLU, which is specially trained for partial
input as discussed in (Sagae et al, 2009). NLU is
predictive in the sense that, for each partial ASR re-
sult, the NLU module tries to output the complete
frame that a human annotator would associate with
the user?s complete utterance, even if that utterance
has not yet been fully processed by the ASR.
The second step in our framework is to train a set
of incremental confidence models (DeVault et al,
2011a), which allow the agents to assess in real time,
while a user is speaking, how well the understand-
ing process is proceeding. The incremental confi-
dence models build on the notion of NLU F-score,
which we use to quantify the quality of a predicted
NLU frame in relation to the hand-annotated correct
frame. The NLU F-score is the harmonic mean of
the precision and recall of the attribute-value pairs
(or frame elements) that compose the predicted and
correct frames for each partial ASR result.
Each of our incremental confidence models
makes a binary prediction for each partial NLU re-
sult as an utterance proceeds. At each time t dur-
ing an utterance, we consider the current NLU F-
Score Ft as well as the final NLU F-Score Ffinal
that will be achieved at the conclusion of the utter-
ance. In (DeVault et al, 2009) and (DeVault et al,
2011a), we explored the use of data-driven decision
tree classifiers to make predictions about these val-
ues, for example whether Ft ? 12 (current level ofunderstanding is ?high?), Ft ? Ffinal (current level
of understanding will not improve), or Ffinal ? 12(final level of understanding will be ?high?). In
this demonstration, we focus on the first and third
of these incremental confidence metrics, which we
summarize as ?Now Understanding? and ?Will Un-
derstand?, respectively.
The incremental ASR, NLU, and confidence out-
puts are passed to the dialogue managers for each of
the agents, Harmony and Utah. These agents then
relate these inputs to their own models of dialogue
context, plans, and emotions, to calculate pragmatic
interpretations, including speech acts, reference res-
olution, participant status, and how they feel about
what is being discussed. A subset of this informa-
tion is passed to the non-verbal behavior generation
module to produce incremental non-verbal listening
behaviors (Wang et al, 2011).
2 Demo script
The demonstration begins with the demo operator
providing a brief overview of the system design, ne-
gotiation scenario, and incremental processing capa-
bilities. The virtual humans Utah and Harmony (see
Figure 1) are running and ready to begin a dialogue
with the user, who will play the role of the Ranger.
The demonstration includes a real-time visualization
of incremental speech processing results, which will
allow attendees to track the virtual humans? under-
standing as an utterance progresses. An example of
this visualization is shown in Figure 2.
As the user speaks to Utah or Harmony, attendees
can observe the real time visualization of incremen-
tal speech processing. Further, the visualization in-
terface enables the demo operator to ?rewind? an ut-
terance and step through the incremental processing
results that arrived each 200 milliseconds.
For example, Figure 2 shows the incremental
speech processing state at a moment 4.8 seconds into
a user?s 7.4 second long utterance, i?ve come here
today to talk to you about whether you?d like to be-
come the sheriff of this town. At this point in time,
the visualization shows (at top left) that the virtual
humans are confident that they are Now Understand-
ing and also Will Understand this utterance. Next,
the graph (in white) shows the history of the agents?
expected NLU F-Score for this utterance (ranging
from 0 to 1). Beneath the graph, the partial ASR re-
sult (HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT...) is displayed (in white), along
with the currently predicted NLU frame (in blue).
For ease of comprehension, an English gloss (utah
do you want to be the sheriff?) for the NLU frame is
also shown (in blue) above the frame.
To the right, in pink, we show some of Utah and
Harmony?s agent state that is based on the current in-
cremental NLU results. The display shows that both
of the virtual humans believe that Utah is being ad-
dressed by this utterance, that utah has a positive at-
titude toward the content of the utterance while har-
mony does not, and that both have comprehension

and participation goals. Further, Harmony believes
she is a side participant at this moment.
