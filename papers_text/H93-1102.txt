PROJECT GOALS 
The general objective of this research as been the enhance- 
ment of traditional key-word based statistical methods of doc- 
ument retrieval with advanced natural anguage processing 
techniques. In the work to date the focus has been on obtifin- 
ing a better representation f document contents by extracting 
representative phrases from syntactically preprocessed text. 
In addition, statistical clustering methods have been devel- 
oped that generate doxn;dn-specific term correlations which 
can be used to obtain better search queries via expansion. 
RECENT RESULTS 
A prototype t xt retrieval system hits been developed inwhich 
a robust natural language processing unodule is integrated with 
a traditional statistical engine (NIST's PRISE). Natural an- 
guage processing is used to (1) preprocess the documents in
order to extract contents-carrying tenns, (2) discover inter- 
term dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific 
to the &ltabase domain, and (3) process user's natural an- 
guage requests into effective search queries. The statistical 
engine builds inverted index files from pre-processed docu- 
ments, and then searches and ranks the documents inresponse 
to user queries. The fe;Lsibility of this approach its been 
demonstrated in various experiments with 'standard' IR col- 
lections uch as CACM-3204 and Cranfield, as well as in the 
large-scale evaluation with TIPSTER database. 
The centerpiece of the natural anguage processing module 
is the TTP parser, a fast and robust syntactic analyzer which 
produces 'regularized' parse structures out of running text. 
The parser, presently the fastest of this type, is designed to 
produce full analyses, but is capable of generating ,approx- 
imate 'best-fit' structures if under a time pressure or when 
faced with unexpected input. 
We participated in the first Text Retrieval Conference (TREC- 
1), during which the total of 500 MBytes of Wall Street Jour- 
nal articles have been parsed. An enhanced version of 'ITP 
parser has been developed for this purpose with the average 
speed ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 seconds per sentence. We also 
developed and improved the morphological word stemmer, 
syntactic dependencies xtractor, and tested sever;d clustering 
formulax. A close co-operation with BBN h~L~ produced a bet- 
ter part-of-speech tagger which is an essential pre-processor 
before parsing. 
We also took part in the continuing parser/gr;unmar evaluation 
workshop. In an informal test runs with 100 sentence s:unple 
of WSJ unaterial, "FrP has conne suprisingly strong ~unong 
'regular' parsers which are hundreds times slower and far 
less robust. During the latest meeting the focus of evaluation 
effort has shifted toward "deeper' epresentations, including 
operator-argument structures which is the sUmdard form of 
output from "FI'P. During last year T IP  licenses have been 
issued to several sites for research purposes. 
In another effort, in co-operation with the Canadian Institute 
of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS), a number of qual- 
itative methods for predicting semantic orrectness of word 
associations are being tested. When finished, these results 
will be used to further improve the accuracy of document 
representation with compound terms. 
Research on reversible grammars continued last year with 
some more important results including a formal evaluation 
system for generation algorithms, and a generalized notion of 
guides for controling the order of evaluation. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
The major effort in the conning months is the participation 
in TREC-2 evaluation. For this purpose we.aquired a new 
version of PRISE system, which is currently being adapted 
to work with language processing module. New nnethods of 
document ranking are also considered, including local scores 
for most relevant fragments within a document. New clus- 
tering methods are tested for generating term similarities, its 
well as more effective filters to subcategorize similarities into 
sennantic lasses.
