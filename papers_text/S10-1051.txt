Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of rank-
ing a list of paraphrases associated with a
noun-noun compound as closely as possi-
ble to human raters (Butnariu et al, 2010).
UCD-Goggle tackles this task using se-
mantic knowledge learnt from the Google
n-grams together with human-preferences
for paraphrases mined from training data.
Empirical evaluation shows that UCD-
Goggle achieves 0.432 Spearman correla-
tion with human judgments.
1 Introduction
Noun compounds (NC) are sequences of nouns
acting as a single noun (Downing, 1977). Re-
search on noun compounds involves two main
tasks: NC detection and NC interpretation. The
latter has been studied in the context of many
natural language applications, including question-
answering, machine translation, information re-
trieval, and information extraction.
The use of multiple paraphrases as a semantic
intepretation of noun compounds has recently be-
come popular (Kim and Baldwin, 2006; Nakov
and Hearst, 2006; Butnariu and Veale, 2008;
Nakov, 2008). The best paraphrases are those
which most aptly characterize the relationship be-
tween the modifier noun and the head noun.
The aim of this current work is to provide a
ranking for a list of paraphrases that best approxi-
mates human rankings for the same paraphrases.
We have created a system called UCD-Goggle,
which uses semantic knowledge acquired from
Google n-grams together with human-preferences
mined from training data. Three major com-
ponents are involved in our system: B-score,
produced by a Bayesian algorithm using seman-
tic knowledge from the n-grams corpus with a
smoothing layer of additional inference; R
t
-score
captures human preferences observed in the tail
distribution of training data; and R
p
-score cap-
tures pairwise paraphrase preferences calculated
from the training data. Our best system for
SemEval-2 task 9 combines all three components
and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.432 with
human rankings.
This paper is organized as follows: the Bayesian
B-score is introduced in section 2. In section 3
we describe two supervised approaches to mining
the preferences of human raters from training data.
Finally, section 4 presents the results of our empir-
ical evaluation of the UCD-Goggle system.
2 Semantic Approach
2.1 Collecting Data
Google have made their web n-grams, also known
as Web-1T corpus, public via the Linguistic Data
Consortium (Brants and Franz, 2006). This cor-
pus contains sequences of n terms that occur more
than 40 times on the web.
We view the paraphrase task as that of suggest-
ing the right verb phrase for two nouns (But-
nariu and Veale, 2008). Previous work has shown
the n-grams corpus to be a promising resource
for retrieving semantic evidence for this approach.
However, the corpus itself needs to be tailored to
serve our purpose. Since the n-grams corpus is a
collection of raw snippets from the web, together
with their web frequency, certain pre-processing
steps are essential before it can be used as a semi-
structured knowledge base. Following a syntac-
tic pattern approach, snippets in the n-grams that
agree with the following patterns are harvested:
1. Head VP Mod
2. Head VP DET Mod
3. Head [that|which] VP Mod
4. Head [that|which] VP DET Mod
Here, DET denotes any of the determiners (i.e.,
230
the set of {an, a, the} for English), Head and Mod
are nouns for heads and modifiers, and VP stands
for verb-based paraphrases observed in the test
data. It must be highlighted that, when we collect
snippets for the KB, any Head or Mod that falls out
of the range of the dataset are also accepted via a
process of semantic slippage (to be discussed in
Sect. 2.4). The patterns listed above enable us to
collect examples such as:
1. ?bread containing nut?
2. ?pill alleviates the headache?
3. ?novel which is about crimes?
4. ?problem that involves the students?
After a shallow parse, these snippets are formal-
ized into the triple format ?Head, Para,Mod?.
The sample snippets above are represented as:
1. ?bread, contain, nut?
2. ?pill, alleviate, headache?
3. ?novel, be about, crime?
4. ?problem, involve, student?
We use ?Head, Para,Mod? to denote the fre-
quency of ?Head, Para,Mod? in the n-grams.
2.2 Loosely Coupled Compound Analysis
Tens of millions of snippets are harvested and
cleaned up in this way, yet expecting even this
large set to provide decent coverage over the test
data is still unrealistic. We calculated the proba-
bility of an example in the test data to appear in
KB at less than 1%. To overcome the coverage is-
sue, a loosely coupled analysis and representation
of compounds is employed. Despite the fact that
both modifier and head can influence the ranking
of a paraphrase, we believe that either the modifier
or the head is the dominating factor in most cases.
This assumption has been shown to be plausible
by earlier work (Butnariu and Veale, 2008). Thus,
instead of storing complete triples in our KB, we
divide each complete triple into two partial triples
as shown below:
?Head, Para,Mod? ?
{
?Head, Para, ??
??, Para,Mod?
We can also retrieve these partial triples directly
from the n-grams corpus using partial patterns like
?Head Para? and ?Para Mod?. However, just as
shorter incomplete patterns can produce a larger
KB, they also accept much more noise. For in-
stance, single-verb paraphrases are very common
among the test data. In these cases, the partial pat-
tern approach would need to harvest snippets with
the form ?NN VV? or ?VV NN? from 2-grams,
which are too common to be reliable.
2.3 Probabilistic Framework
In the probabilistic framework, we define the B-
score as the conditional probability of a para-
phrase, Para, being suggested for a given com-
pound Comp:
B(Para;Comp) ? P (Para|Comp) (1)
Using the KB, we can estimate this conditional
probability by applying the Bayes theorem:
P (Para|Comp) =
P (Comp|Para)P (Para)
P (Comp)
(2)
The loose-coupling assumption (Sect. 2.2) allows
us to estimate P (Comp) as:
P (Comp) ? P (Mod ?Head). (3)
Meanwhile, a priori probabilities such as
P (Para) can be easily inferred from the KB.
2.4 Inferential Smoothing Layer
After applying the loose-coupling technique de-
scribed in Section 2.2, the coverage of the KB
rises to 31.78% (see Figure 1). To further in-
crease this coverage, an inference layer is added
to the system. This layer aims to stretch the con-
tents of the KB via semantic slippage to the KB, as
guided by the maximization of a fitness function.
A WordNet-based similarity matrix is employed
(Seco et al, 2004) to provide a similarity measure
between nouns (so sim(x, x) is 1). Then, a su-
perset of Head or Mod (denoted as H andM re-
spectively) can be extracted by including all nouns
with similarity greater than 0 to any of them in the
test data. Formally, for Head we have:
H = {h|sim(h,Head) ? 0, Head in dataset}.
(4)
The definition ofM is analogous to that ofH.
A system of equations is defined to produce al-
ternatives for Head and Mod and their smoothed
corpus frequencies (we show only the functions
for head here):
h
0
= Head (5)
fit(h) = sim
2
(h, h
n
)? ?h, p, ?? (6)
h
n+1
= arg max
h?H
fit(h) (7)
231
Here, fit(h) is a fitness function of the can-
didate head h, in the context of a paraphrase p.
Empirically, we use h
1
for Head and fit(h
1
) for
?Head, Para, ?? when calculating the B-score
back in the probabilistic framework (Sect. 2.3). In
theory, we can apply this smoothing step repeat-
edly until convergence is obtained.
Figure 1: Comparison on coverage.
This semantic slippage mechanism allows a
computer to infer the missing parts of the KB, by
building a bridge between the limitations of a fi-
nite KB and the knowledge demands of an appli-
cation. Figure 1 above shows how the coverage of
the system increases when using partial matching
and the smoothing technique, over the use of exact
matching with the KB.
3 Preferences for Paraphrases
3.1 Tail-based Preference
Similar to various types of data studied by social
scientists, the distribution of strings in our corpus
tends to obey Zipf?s law (Zipf, 1936). The same
Zipfian trend was also observed in the compound-
paraphrase dataset: more than 190 out of 250 com-
pounds in the training data have 60% of their para-
phrases in an undiscriminating tail, while 245 of
250 have 50% of their paraphrases in the tail. We
thus assume the existence of a long tail in the para-
phrase list for each compound.
The tail of each paraphrase list can be a valuable
heuristic for modeling human paraphrase prefer-
ences. We refer to this model as the tail-based
preference model. We assume that an occurrence
of a paraphrase is deemed to occur in the tail iff it
is mentioned by the human raters only once. Thus,
the tail preference is defined as the probability that
a paraphrase appears in the non-tail part of the list
for all compounds in the training data. Formally,
it can be expressed as:
R
t
(p) =
?
c?C
?(c, p)f(c, p)
?
c?C
f(c, p)
(8)
where C is the set of all compounds in the training
data and f(c, p) is the frequency of paraphrase p
on compound c as given by the human raters. The
?(c, p) is a filter coefficient as shown below:
?(c, p) =
{
1, f(c, p) > 1,
0, f(c, p) = 1.
(9)
The tail-based preference model is simple but
effective when used in conjunction with seman-
tic ranking via the KB acquired from n-grams.
However, an important drawback is that the tail
model assigns a static preference to paraphrase
(i.e., tail preferences are assumed to be context-
independent). More than that, this preference does
not take information from non-tail paraphrases
into consideration. Due to these downsides, we
use pairwise preferences described below.
3.2 Pairwise Preference
To fully utilize the training data, we employ an-
other preference mining approach called pairwise
preference modeling. This approach applies the
principle of pairwise comparison (David, 1988)
to determine the rank of a paraphrase inside a list.
We build a pairwise comparison matrix ? for
paraphrases using the values of Equation 10 (here
we have assumed that each of the paraphrases has
been mapped into numeric values):
?
i,j
=
{
n(p
i
,p
j
)
n(p
i
,p
j
)+n(p
j
,p
i
)
, n(p
i
, p
j
) > n(p
j
, p
i
),
0, otherwise.
(10)
where n(p
i
, p
j
) is the relative preferability of p
i
to p
j
. To illustrate the logic behind n(x, y), we
imagine a scenario with three compounds shown
in Table 1:
abor. prob. abor. vote arti. desc.
involve 12 8 3
concern 10 9 5
be about 3 9 15
Table 1: An example
1
to illustrate n(x, y)
1
In this example, abor. prob. stands for abortion problem,
abor. vote stands for abortion vote, and arti. desc. stands for
artifact description
232
The relative preferability is given by the number
of times that the frequency of p
i
from human raters
is greater than that of p
j
. Observing that 1 out of
3 times involve is ranked higher than concern, we
can calculate their relative preferability as:
n(involve, concern) = 1
n(concern, involve) = 2
Once the matrix is built, the preference score for
a paraphrase i is calculated as:
R
p
(i; c) =
?
j?P
c
?
i,j
|P
c
|
(11)
whereP
c
is the list of paraphrases for a given com-
pound c in the test data. The pairwise preference
puts a paraphrase in the context of its company, so
that the opinions of human raters can be approxi-
mated more precisely.
4 Empirical Results
We evaluated our system by tackling theSemEval-
2 task 9 test data. We created three systems with
different combinations of the three components
(B, R
t
, R
p
). Table 2 below shows the perfor-
mance of UCD-Goggle for each setting:
System Config Spearman ? Pearson r
I B + R
t
0.380 0.252
II R
p
0.418 0.375
III B + R
t
+ R
p
0.432 0.395
* Baseline 0.425 0.344
Table 2: Evaluation results on different settings of
the UCD-Goggle system.
The first setting is a hybrid system which first
calculates a ranking according to the ngrams cor-
pus and then applies a very simple preference
heuristic (Sect. 2.3 and 3.1). The second setting
simply applies the pairwise preference algorithm
to the training data to learn ranking preferences
(Sect. 3.2). Finally, the third setting integrates
both of these settings in a single approach.
The individual contribution of B-score and R
t
was tested by two-fold cross validation applied to
the training data. The training data was split into
two subsets and preferences were learnt from one
part and then applied to the other. As an unsuper-
vised algorithm, B-score produced Spearman cor-
relation of 0.31 while the R
t
-score gave 0.33. We
noticed that more than 78% of the paraphrases had
0 score by R
t
. This number not only reconfirmed
the existence of the long-tail phenomenon, but also
suggested thatR
t
-score alone could hardly capture
the preference on the non-tail part. On the other
hand, with more than 80% chance we could expect
B to produce a non-zero score for a paraphrase,
even if the paraphrase fell out of the topic. When
combined together, B and R
t
complemented each
other and improved the performance considerably.
However, this combined effort still could not beat
the pairwise preference R
p
or the baseline system,
which had no semantic knowledge involved. The
major limitation of our system is that the seman-
tic approach is totally ignorant of the training data.
In future work, we will intend to use it as a valu-
able resource in both KB construction and ranking
stage.
