Project Goals 
1. To provide a central role in the design, 
development and distribution of speech and natural 
language corpora for the DARPA SLS research 
community. 
2. To design, coordinate implementation f, and 
analyze results of performance assessment tests for 
DARPA's Spoken Language Systems. 
Recent  Results 
1. Prepared the complete DARPA TIMIT Corpus for 
release on CD-ROM (CDI-I.1). This release includes 
the complete 630-speaker corpus, verified/corrected 
time-aligned phonetic labels, new time-aligned word- 
boundary labels, and a phonemic lexicon. 
2. Prepared the ATIS0 Pilot Corpus for release in 
CD-ROM format. Two single discs (CD5-1.1, 5-2.1), 
and two (CD5-3.1, 5-4.1) (out of a planned set of six) 
discs have been prepared and released within the 
DARPA Community. 
3. Prepared the DARPA Spoken Language Systems 
February 1991 Benchmark Test Material Disc 
(CDT-i.1). 
4. Defined and developed additional test procedures 
and software for evaluating spontaneous ATIS SPeech 
RECognition (SPREC) systems, and for ATIS Class 
D1 query pairs. 
5. Coordinated DARPA Corpora and Performance 
Evaluation Committee and Working Group Activities. 
6. Administered and scored the February 1991 
DARPA SLS Resource Management and ATIS 
Benchmark Tests. 
7. In collaboration with Texas Instruments (and using 
NIST funding), prepared the TI Connected Digits 
Database for production on a three-CD-ROM set 
(CD4-1.1, 4-2.1, 4-3.1). 
Plans for the Coming  Year  
1. Complete production of the ATIS0 six-CD-ROM 
set (adding CD5-5.1, and CD5-6.1), incorporating 
corrections to the documentation a d transcription 
files as possible. 
2. Produce ATIS material provided by SRI (and 
others, as resources permit) on CD-ROM in 
"standard" format with auxiliary files. Additional 
material may include corpora collected to date by 
CMU and MIT. 
3. Collaborate with others (e.g., CMU, and possibly 
TI and/or NYNEX) in preparing other speech corpora 
for release in CD-ROM format. 
4. Participate in Performance Evaluation Working 
Group activities within the DARPA SLS Program. 
5. Analyze the results of the February 1991 
Benchmark Tests. 
6. Prepare for the October 1991 Benchmark Tests.
