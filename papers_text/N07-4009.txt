Abstract 
The CALO Meeting Assistant is an inte-
grated, multimodal meeting assistant tech-
nology that captures speech, gestures, and 
multimodal data from multiparty interactions 
during meetings, and uses machine learning 
and robust discourse processing to provide a 
rich, browsable record of a meeting. 
1 Introduction 
Technologies that assist in making meetings more 
productive have a long history. The latest chapter in 
that history involves projects that integrate recent 
advances in speech, natural language understanding, 
vision, and multimodal interaction technologies in 
an effort to produce tools that can perceive what 
happens at a meeting, extract salient events and in-
teractions, and produce a record of the meeting that 
people can later consult or analyze. 
Research projects such as the ICSI Meeting Pro-
ject (Janin et al 2004) have sought to produce auto-
mated and segmented transcripts from natural, multi-
party speech as it occurs in meetings. Others, like 
the ISL Smart Meeting Room Task (Waibel et al 
2003), and the M4 and AMI projects (Nijholt, op 
den Akker, & Heylen 2005), employ instrumented

meeting rooms to collect multiple streams of behav-
ior data and analyze the interactions of meeting par-
ticipants to produce a rich and flexible record of 
their meeting activities, while also providing a sup-
portive environment for collaboration. 
The CALO Meeting Assistant is similar to the lat-
ter in that it collects multiple streams of information 
about the behaviors of people in meetings, and as-
similates speech, movement, and note-taking behav-
ior to create a rich representation of the meeting that 
can be analyzed and reviewed at many levels. How-
ever, a primary aim of the CALO Meeting Assistant 
is to integrate its observations with those of a larger 
system of agents, which can assess the meeting data 
it collects in the context of the ongoing projects and 
workflow in the work lives of each of the meeting 
participants. Thus, our meeting assistant aims to 
reach beyond an intelligent room that understands 
only the activities of people in meetings, and at-
tempts to understand their overarching concerns and 
interpret their behaviors from the perspective of 
what their meetings mean to them. 
That overarching system of agents is being devel-
oped under the DARPA CALO (Cognitive Assistant 
that Learns and Organizes) Program, which seeks to 
produce machine learning technology in the form of 
personalized agents that support high-level knowl-
edge workers in carrying out their professional ac-
tivities. The CALO system handles a broad range of 
interrelated decision-making tasks that are tradition-
ally resistant to automation; doing so partly by inter-
acting with, being advised by, and learning from its 
users. The CALO system can take initiative on com-
pleting routine tasks, and on assisting when the un-
expected happens. 
CALO is designed from the ground up as a cogni-
tive system. Whereas conventional, hand-coded soft-
ware excels at a narrow set of capabilities in a 
17
particular domain, cognitive systems maintain ex-
plicit, declarative models of their capabilities, ongo-
ing activities, and operating environments. These 
models enable CALO to extend and improve its ca-
pabilities through learning and adaptation. Cognitive 
systems are better equipped to cope with unexpected 
developments, learn to improve over time, and adapt 
to the contexts and requirements of different situa-
tions. CALO also uses natural interfaces that enable 
simple, effective interactions with humans and other 
cognitive systems. 
The CALO Meeting Assistance Project is devel-
oping capabilities to enable CALO to participate in 
group discussions and meetings. Unlike instru-
mented ?intelligent room? meeting projects, this sys-
tem is designed for users in an office environment 
with access to the Internet, a laptop, and some small, 
off-the-shelf peripheral devices (such as headsets, 
webcams, and digital writing devices) to capture 
speech, gestures, and handwriting. It aims to be un-
obtrusive by leveraging cross-training, unsupervised 
learning, and lightweight supervision captured from 
normal user interaction (e.g., users reviewing and 
editing notes, or adding detected action items to a to-
do list). 
These data are transparently processed at a central 
server location and redistributed, so the meeting as-
sistant interacts seamlessly with other CALO desk-
top functionalities, using a common ontology. 
2 What it does 
The CALO Meeting Assistant helps its owners by 
capturing and interpreting meeting conversations 
and activities and, as appropriate, retrieving relevant 
information. Information gleaned from a meeting 
can be incorporated in the respective owner?s CALO 
knowledge stores to, for example, track commit-
ments and remember references to projects, people, 
places, and dates. An archive of each meeting pro-
vides a searchable record for users, as well as a his-
tory of training data for CALO?s learning 
components. Learning areas include the following: 
Speech processing?Automatic transcriptions are pro-
duced from conversational speech among multiple 
speakers while adapting to speaker and background 
noise; recognizing prosodic cues; learning new vo-
cabulary; and constructing person, role, and topic-
specific language models. 
Visual recognition?Faces, gaze direction, gestures, 
and activities are detected, and detection is improved 
through lightly-supervised learning and unsuper-
vised cross-training. 
Discourse understanding?Dialog moves are recog-
nized, topics are segmented and grouped through 
supervised and unsupervised generative models, ac-
tion items are detected, and discussions can be 
threaded across documents and email. 
Multimodal reinforcement?Pen, speech, and text in-
puts combine to offer natural communications. 
Meeting activity?Speech and note-taking activities 
combine to provide cross-training for recognizing 
meeting phases, and for tracking agendas and docu-
ment usage. 
3 Demo 
We demonstrate how the CALO Meeting Assistant 
captures speech, pen, and other meeting data using 
an ordinary laptop; produces an automated tran-
script; segments by topic; and performs shallow dis-
course understanding to produce a list of probable 
action items arising from a single, pre-recorded 
meeting. We then demonstrate a Meeting Rapporteur 
that provides a meeting summary and allows partici-
pants to review and organize the meeting transcript, 
audio, notes, action items, and topics?all while 
providing actions in a feedback loop that supports 
the meeting assistant?s semi-supervised learning 
process. Finally, we discuss the potential and current 
development of real-time capabilities that allow us-
ers to interact with the meeting assistant during an 
ongoing meeting.
