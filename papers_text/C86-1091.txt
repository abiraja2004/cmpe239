Creat ing a knowledge base has always been a bott leneck 
in the implementat ion of AI systems. This is also true 
for Natural I,anguage Understanding (NhU)  systems, 
part icu lar ly  \[or data-dr iven ones. Whi le a perfect 
system for automatic acquis i t ion of all sorts of 
knowledge is still far from being realized, partial 
solut ions are possib\]e. This holds especial\] y for 
\]exica\] data. Nevertheless,  the task is not tr ivial,  
in part icular  when deal :i ng with \] anguages rich in 
inflectional forms like German. Out system is to be 
used by persons with no specJ<\]c l inguist ic knowledge, 
thus l inguist ic expert ise \]\]as been put int:o the system 
to ascertain correct clas!;ifJcation o\[ words. 
C\]assJ l icat ion is done by means of ~I small rule ba~ed 
sy'stem wJ th i ex\] ca\] know\] edge and \] anguage -speci fic 
houri sties. 'Phe key idea is the Jdent:i f JcatJon e~ 
three sorts o\[ knowledge which are processed dist inct ly  
and the optLma\] use el knowledge already contained in 
the exist ing lexicon. 
1 . In t roduct ion  
In this paper we introduce a system For  the  
semi-automat ic  enlargement of a morphological  lexicon. 
\]7t forms part of VIE-I,ANG, a Geru~an language dia logue 
system (Buchbetgor et al. 1982). ViE-hANG serves not 
only as an oh)oct but as a meta system as we\]\]: its 
knowledge has.; is to be en\]argnd, and its \[acJ\] \[Lies 
are used to support that process: the parser serves to 
anal.yze tile input to the acqu\] s\] t\] on system, the 
generator \]s used to provide examples. 
IZn contrast Lo Engl ish the morphological  analysis of 
German words is no trivia\] task, due to two causes: 
- \]"Jrst:, there is a rich \]nl\]ectiona\] system, 
connJst ing of about 60 d~ \[ferent endings (where most 
endings have var ious di f ferent interpretations),  some 
prefixes ('re-' \[or PPP, 'zu' Coy some inf init ive 
forms), 'umlautung', and Jrregu\].ar Terms, 
- second, \] emma\] J zation has to be complemented by 
interpretation, because the functional structure of a 
sentence Js not bound to const i tuent order but to the 
case system (expressed by inf lection) instead. 
To bui ld up a lexicon, one needs a c lass i f icat ion of 
(;erman words on the basis of their graphemic 
real ization. There exist several works on \]hi s 
sub~ect, e.g. Bergmann (1982), Knopik (1984), Schott 
(\]978), Schu\]ze and Heinze (1982), WJ\] lee (1979). For 
VIE-LANG we developed our own c lass i f icat ion scheme 
(T~ost and Doff \ ]nor 1986), based on Kunze and Ruediger 
(1968). 
For all those schemeR Jt takes an expert to classify 
new words correctly. Our acquis i t ion system contains 
\ ] \ ]ngulst ic expert ise in the fornl of d i f ferent typos of 
rules, which al lows for semi-automat ic  acquis(t Jon of 
\]exica\] knowledge in an interact ion with a user who 
need not have spec\] f J c i ingu\] st i c knowledge. 
Whereas di f ferent approaches for knowledge acquis i t ion 
for N\],U systems have been proposed (e.g. Ba\] lard 
(1984), Haas and HendrJx (1982)), we concentrate on the 
acquis i t ion oC \[exical data /\[or the German language by 
using specif ic  propert ies of this domain. 
2.  The Morpho log ic  C lass i f i ca t ion  Scheme 
Out: c lass i f icat ion schem(; is based pr imari ly  on the 
sets el suff ixes that call be attached to certain stems. 
Every di f ferent set: const i tutes a morphological  class, 
and every lexicon entry Calls exact ly into one of these 
classes. ALtogether there are about 70 d i f ferent  ones. 
For each class two lists are stored: One contaJnLng 
the set of suff ixes belonging to the class, and another 
one containing the syntact ic interpretat ion for each oF 
these suffixes. Super\] reposed on this scheme is 
information about 'umlaut' and pref ix 'ge'. rPhey occult 
oii\] y J n a few pos i tions, dependi ng on the word 
cat_egory. \]):very possJ b\]e comb\] nation \] s represented by

We di st\] rlgni sh between morpho\] ogic and syntact ic 
Jnfornlation, the latter being a CeatLlrO e\[ the \]exeme 
itself (and not expressed by inflection). Mnrphologic  
information consists of the Fol lowing features:

PV : In fo rmat ion  about :  \ [e rmak Jon  o17 Pnp (verhs  on ly )  
FM : In\[o:mation about other forms (supple\]ion) 
'Phe syntact ic inIYormation is stored in the feature SY. 
it consists of the fol lowing data: 
word category (verb, noun, pronoun, etc. ) 
- gender o \[ nouns 
subcategory (auxJlJa17y, modal, proper name, etc.) 
- case (for preposit ions) 
- auxi l iary for present and past: pel:foct ('habon' or 
' so in '  ) 
- separab\]e vorbadjuncts 
This Jnformatlon is coded into a number, the Ci~sL 
digit  roprosent:ing the word category, the other ones 
depending on Jt (e.g. gender only for nouns). 
As an example Jolt's look at: the entr ies \[7oE the verb 
'geben' (to give). Three forms are to be considered, 
'gob' Js the s tem for present tense and PPP, 'glb' ffor 
2nd and 3rd person sg present tense indicative, and 
'gab' for past tense. The correspond\] ng dJ eti onary 
entr ies have the fol lowing form: 
GEB: Key: I,XM#889 G\]B: Key: LXM#718

PF: 1 P\]:': 0

SY: 500 GAB: Key: LXM#754 
FORR: (LXM#718 LXM#754) KL: 23 
UM : 3 
PF: 0 
'2he two lists for morphologic  class 22 are given below: 
END22 : (E EN END EST ET T) 
INT22: (E (\]11 121 123) EN (3 6 \]\]4 124) END (4) 
EST (122) ET (125) T (115 52)) 
The suff ix list g~ves the poss ib le endings of the words 
in class 22, the interpretat ion \].ist gives tile (:ode of 
a\]\] forms expressed by ally one of these endings.

3. Knowledge Base  
The acquisition system is rule based. Its knowledge 
base comprises three types of rules: 
- Rules representing inflectional paradigms. These 
rules describe the basic types of conjugation and 
declination in German. 
- Morphonological rules. The basic inflectional 
endings are split up into a much larger set by 
various morphonological rules which alter the endings 
and stems to make pronunciation easier. 
- Heuristic rules. While the former two rule types are 
derived from the German grammar proper, these rules 
are like plausible guesses. They guide the system to 
make choices like which category a word belongs to 
according to knowledge about forms (i.e. all verbs 
end with -en), actual frequency of classes, etc. 
These rules are organized in distinct packages. Only 
rules in active packages are considered. Rules may 
activate and deactivate rule packages. 
4. Overall Architecture 
According to their different nature, the three 
mentioned types of rules are processed differently. 
Knowledge about inflectional types serves to partition 
the words into disjunct classes. Once the inflectional 
type has been determined, there are relatively clear 
guidelines as to the inflection of the word. The 
inflectional type actually is a subclassification of 
the word type. 
One of the crucial points is determining the word type. 
The system first tries to make use of its basic 
vocabulary. It checks whether a new word is composed 
of words already in the lexicon or of an existing word 
stem together with a derivational ending. There is a 
rule in German morphology stating that in compound 
words the morphological class is determined by the last 
word. On a similar line reasoning about derivational 
endings is performed, as those may determine word type 
as well as inflection. As a next heuristic 
morphological clues are taken into consideration. 
There exist a number of them, but ambiguities may 
arise. If this is the case, a third strategy is 
applied: the system asks the user to type in a short 
utterance containing the new word. The utterance is 
analysed by the parser of VIE-LANG rendering 
information about the word type by means of the phrase 
type it appears in. In applying this method, the 
system relies on a simple but important presupposition: 
the user usually enters an utterance containing the 
word in a proper linguistic context facilitating 
determination of its type. We do not argue that the 
user will always utter the minimal projection, but that 
he will not violate phrase borders with his utterance. 
The knowledge about phrase types as well as the basic 
vocabulary permits unambiguous determination of the 
word type in most cases, especially as the most 
irregular forms that are very limited in number (words 
of the closed word classes: pronouns, articles, 
auxiliary and modal verbs, etc.) have already been 
included in the basic lexicon. 
Once the word type has been determined, the rule 
package associated with it is activated. Let's suppose 
the new word is a verb. Then, the verb-package is 
triggered. Here in turn we find packages for strong 
and weak inflection. The large number of subclasses is 
implied by morphonological reasons, whereby the small 
number of general paradigms is multiplied. 
Morphonologic rules have exact matching conditions, 
therefore classification in this part is automated to a 
388 
large extent. The on\].y problem is deciding for weak or 
strong inflection first. As exact rules do not exist, 
heuristics are applied which are based mainly on word 
frequency. 
An important feature is the dynamic interaction 
register: the hypotheses evoked by the heuristic rules 
require to be confirmed by the user. The system knows 
which word forms will form sufficient evidence for a 
certain hypothesis. It will generate these forms and 
ask the user for confirmation. The forms however 
depend on the hypotheses. Thus, the user is only asked 
a minimum of questions. The forms to be asked for are 
kept in a dynamic interaction register which is updated 
with every hypothesis and every answer from the user. 
5. An  Example  Sess ion  
In this chapter we show how a new entry is actually 
created. The user starts the interaction by entering a 
new word, e.g. 'abgeben' (to leave). The first thing 
the system has to do is to decide about the word 
category. To find out if it is a compound word it will 
try to split off words first from the beginning then 
from the end. 
This will result in recognizing 'ab' as a separable 
verbadjunct. Of course the 'ab '  could be part of a 
totally different stem like 'Abend' (evening) or 'abet' 
(but). So the system looks for facts supporting the 
verb hypothesis. Verbs are usually typed in in 
infinitive form and this implies the ending '-en' (in a 
few cases also '-n'). Of course this '-en' could also 
be part of a stem like 'Magen' (stomach) or 'wegen' 
(because), but the combination of both verb adjunct 
'ab' and ending '-en' on a word belonging to a 
different category is highly unp\]ausible. So 'abgeben' 
is split into ab/geb/en. 
As a next step the lexicon is looked up for 'geb'. If 
it is found the rest is easy. All the information from 
'geb' is simply duplicated; the only additional 
information to be stored is about the separable 'ab'. 
This way the new entry may be created without any other 
help by the user. 
To continue with our example we will assume that 'geb' 
is not already contained in the lexicon. That means 
the system has to figure out a hypothesis concerning 
the conjugation type of 'abgeben' (either weak or 
strong). Since weak verbs make up the vast majority of 
German verbs, this hypothesis is tried first. 
FORM CLASS FM UM PF SY 
present tense abgeb 44 0 0 I 502 
Weak conjugation is regular, all forms are built from 
one stem. To confirm weak conjugation it suffices to 
show the user the Ist person sg past tense. Before 
doing so all morphonological rules connected to weak 
conjugation are tried. None applies, so user 
interaction can start. Ist person sg of past tense in 
the weak paradigm is 'gebte ab'. To make sure the user 
knows which form is intended, some context has to be 
provided. This leads to the phrase 'gestern gebte ich 
ab' (I leaved yesterday) specifying tense and person. 
The user recognizes 'gebte' as incorrect and rejects 
that phrase. This makes the system discard the 
hypothesis weak and try strong instead. 
Strong conjugation is more complicated than weak. 
There may be a maximum of four different stems for 
present tense, present tense 2nd and 3rd person sg, 
past tense and PPP. All these poss ib i l i t ies  have 
either to be resolved automatical ly  or asked expl ic i t ly  
from the user. First the system continues to determine 
the past tense forms. There are three di f ferent types 
of vowel changes in the case of 'e'-stems (e-a-e, 
e-o-o, e-a-o). They are sorted by frequency, because 
no other cr i ter ion is avai lable. Again all 
morphonological  rules appl icab\]e to strong verbs are 
tried. In our case none applies, so the user is asked 
again for ver i f icat ion with 'gestern gab ich ab' (I 
left yesterday). 
FORM CLASS 
present tense abgeb 30 
pres. t .2nd p.sg 
past tense abgab 23 
past part ic ip le 
FM UM PF SY 
This t ime the user confirms, so the system can go on. 
There are two possib i l i t ies  for the PPP, and again the 
more frequent one is tried, and accepted by the user. 
There is sti l l  another i rregular i ty concerning 2nd and 
3rd person sg present tense, in most of the cases the 
stem vowel 'e' becomes 'i'. After ver i f icat ion of this 
fact the morphological  class is f inally determined. 
The system creates three lexical entries 'abgeb', 
'abgib' and 'abgab' for present and PPP, 2nd and 3rd 
person sg present tense and past tense respectively. 
Now all of the features have to be fi l led in. PF of 
'abgeb' is set to I, since the verbadjunct  'ab' implies 
the use of the pref ix 'ge-' for the PPP. UM is set to 
8 for 'abgab', indicating 'umlautung' for the 
subjunct ive mode in the Dast tense. FM of th~ pr imary 
entry 'abgeb' is set to 8 as a resu\]t of the 
combinat ion of classes. Then SY is set to 502 (5 = 
verb, 0 = present perfect with 'haben', 2 : separable 
verbadjunct  of length 2). 
FORM CLASS FM UM PF SY 
present tense abgeb 22 8 0 I 502 
pres.t .2nd p.sg abgib 26 0 0 
past tense abgab 23 8 0 
Next all indicat ive forms of present and past tense and 
the PPP are pr inted and the user is asked for 
confirmation. This step could actual ly  be skipped but 
it is another safety measure against faulty entries. 
In our specif ic  example there is a final step to be 
done: Since 'geb' was not found in the lexicon, it has 
to be included, too, for two reasons. First the 
analysis a lgor i thm otherwise could not handle all those 
cases where the part ic le is actual ly split off in the 
text, second there may be more compound verbs with 
'geb', and their incorporation into the lexicon can 
then be handled fully automatic. Since the verb stem 
of a compound verb with separable verbadjunct  can 
always appear as a verb in its own right, this poses no 
problem. The situat ion is s l ightly more di f f icult  with 
other part ic les where this is not granted. In those 
cases the new entry must be marked as internal, so that 
it does not affect analysis or synthesis. 
Creat ion of the new entries is simple anyway. All 
forms are dupl icated, 'abgeb', 'abgib' and 'abgab' are 
changed to 'geb', 'gib', 'gab' respect ively and SY is 
set to 500 instead of 502. 
6. Conclus ion 
We have presented a sysLem which automates acquis i t ion 
of lexical data for a natural language understanding 
system to a large extent. Knowledge acquis i t ion takes 
place in graceful  interaction with a human who is not 
supposed to have specif ic l inguist ic knowledge. The 
system relies on the exist ing natural language system 
VIE-LANG containing among other sources of knowledge a 
lexicon with a basic vocabulary such that acquis i t ion 
does not start from scratch but can be seen as an 
iterative process. The acquis i t ion system is based on 
a small rule based system in which three dif ferent 
sorts of knowledge - inflections\],  morphonological  and 
heurist ic are d ist inguished and processed 
dif ferently.  As for der\ [vat ional  endings as well as 
compound words the system heavi ly relies on exist ing 
lexicon entr ies to form its hypotheses. 
The descr ibed system forms part of an integrated system 
for the acquis i t ion of di f ferent sorts of knowledge for 
natural language understanding. An outl ine of the 
overal l  system is to be found in Trost and Buchberger 
(\]985). The final goal wil l  be a system which augments 
its knowledge automatical ly  in every interaction with 
the user in a pract ical  and comfortable way.
