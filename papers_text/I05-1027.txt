Abstract. This paper  proposes a two-step method for Chinese text categoriza-
tion (TC). In the first step, a Na?ve Bayesian classifier is used to fix the fuzzy 
area between two categories, and, in the second step, the classifier with more 
subtle and powerful features is used to deal with documents in the fuzzy area, 
which are thought of being unreliable in the first step. The preliminary experi-
ment validated the soundness of this method. Then, the method is extended 
from two-class TC to multi-class TC. In this two-step framework, we try to fur-
ther improve the classifier by taking the dependences among features into con-
sideration in the second step, resulting in a Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier. 
1   Introduction 
Text categorization (TC) is a task of assigning one or multiple predefined category 
labels to natural language texts. To deal with this sophisticated task, a variety of sta-
tistical classification methods and machine learning techniques have been exploited 
intensively[1], including the Na?ve Bayesian (NB) classifier [2], the Vector Space 
Model (VSM)-based classifier [3], the example-based classifier [4], and the Support 
Vector Machine [5]. 
Text  filtering is a basic type of text categorization (two-class TC). It can find 
many real-life applications [6], a typical one is the ill information filtering, such as 
erotic information and garbage information filtering on the web, in e-mails and in 
short messages of mobile phone. It is obvious that this sort of information should be 
carefully controlled. On the other hand, the filtering performance using the existing 
methodologies is still not satisfactory in general. The reason lies in that there exist a 
number of documents with high degree of ambiguity, from the TC point of view, in a 
document collection, that is, there is a fuzzy area across the border of two classes (for 
the sake of expression, we call the class consisting of the ill information-related texts, 
or, the negative samples, the category of TARGET, and, the class consisting of the ill 
information-not-related texts, or, the positive samples, the category of Non-
TARGET). Some documents in one category may have great similarities with some 
other documents in the other category, for example, a lot of words concerning love 
 Classifying Chinese Texts in Two Steps 303 
story and sex are likely appear in both negative samples and positive samples if the 
filtering target is erotic information. We observe that most of the classification errors 
come from the documents falling into the fuzzy area between two categories. 
The idea of this paper is inspired by the fuzzy area between categories.  A two-step 
TC method is thus proposed: in the first step, a classifier is used to fix the fuzzy area 
between categories; in the second step, a classifier (probably the same as that in the 
first step) with more subtle and powerful features is used to deal with documents in 
the fuzzy area which are thought of being unreliable in the first step. Experimental 
results validate the soundness of this method. Then we extend it from two-class TC to 
multi-class TC. Furthermore, in this two-step framework, we try to improve the clas-
sifier by taking the dependences among features into consideration in the second step, 
resulting in a Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the two-step method in the 
context of two-class Chinese TC; Section 3 extends it to multi-class TC; Section 4 
introduces the Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier; and Section 5 is conclusions.  
2   Basic Idea: A Two-Step Approach to Text Categorization 
2.1   Fix the Fuzzy Area Between Categories by the Na?ve Bayesian Classifier 
We use the Na?ve Bayesian Classifier to fix the fuzzy area in the first step. For a 
document represented by a binary-valued vector d = (W1, W2, ?, W|D|), the two-class 
Na?ve Bayesian Classifier is given as follows:

Apparently,  f(d)=0 is the separate line in a two-dimensional space with X and Y

viewed as a point (x, y), in which the values of x and y are calculated according to (3) 
and (4).  
As shown in Fig.1, the distance from the point (x, y) to the separate line will be:

Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of a training set (refer to Section 2.2) regarding 
Dist in the two-dimensional space, with the curve on the left for the negative samples, 
and the curve on the right for the positive samples. As can be seen in the figure, most 
of the misclassified documents, which unexpectedly across the separate line, are near 
the line. The error rate of the classifier is heavily influenced by this area, though the 
documents falling into this area only constitute a small portion of the training set.

where Dist1 and Dist2 are constants determined by experiments, Dist1 is positive real 
number and Dist2 is negative real number. 
In the second step, more subtle and powerful features will be designed in particular 
to tackle the unreliable area identified in the first step. 
2.2   Experiments on the Two-Class TC 
The dataset used here is composed of 12,600 documents with 1,800 negative samples 
of TARGET and 10,800 positive samples of Non-TARGET. It is split into 4 parts 
randomly, with three parts as training set and one part as test set. All experiments in 
this section are performed in 4-fold cross validation.  
CSeg&Tag3.0, a Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging system developed 
by Tsinghua University, is used to perform the morphological analysis for Chinese 
texts. In the first step, Chinese words with parts-of-speech verb, noun, adjective and 
adverb are considered as features. The original feature set is further reduced to a much 
smaller one according to formula (8) or (9). A Na?ve Bayesian Classifier is then ap-
plied to the test set. In the second step, only the documents that are identified unreli-
able in terms of (7) in the first step are concerned. This time, bigrams of Chinese 
words with parts-of-speech verb and noun are used as features, and the Na?ve Bayes-
ian Classifier is re-trained and applied again.

where tk stands for the kth feature, which may be a Chinese word or a word bigram, 
and ci is the ith predefined category.  
We try five methods as follows.  
Method-1: Use Chinese words as features, reduce features with (9), and classify 
documents directly without exploring the two-step strategy.  
Method-2: same as Method-1 except feature reduction with (8).  
Method-3: same as Method-1 except Chinese word bigrams as features.  
Method-4: Use the mixture of Chinese words and Chinese word bigrams as fea-
tures, reduce features with (8), and classify documents directly.  
Method-5: (i.e., the proposed method): Use Chinese words as features in the first 
step and then use word bigrams as features in the second step, reduce features with 
(8), and classify the documents in two steps. 
306 X. Fan et al 
Note that the proportion of negative samples and positive samples is 1:6. Thus if 
all the documents in the test set is arbitrarily set to positive, the precision will reach 
85.7%. For this reason, only the experimental results for negative samples are consid-
ered in evaluation, as given in Table 1. For each method, the number of features is set 
by the highest point in the curve of the classifier performance with respect to the 
number of features (For the limitation of space, we omit all the curves here). The 
numbers of features set in five methods are 4000, 500, 15000, 800 and 500+3000 (the 
first step + the second step) respectively. 
Table 1.  Performance comparisons of the five methods in two-class TC 
 
Comparing Method-1 and Method-2, we can see that feature reduction formula (8) 
is superior to (9). Moreover, the number of features determined in the former is less 
than that in the latter (500 vs. 4000). Comparing Method-2, Method-3 and Method-4, 
we can see that Chinese word bigrams as features have better discriminating capabil-
ity meanwhile with more serious data sparseness: the performances of Method-3 and 
Method-4 are higher than that of Method-2, but the number of features used in 
Method-3 is more than those used in Method-2 and Method-4 (15000 vs. 500 and 
800). Table 1 shows that the proposed method (Methond-5) has the best performance 
(95.54% F1) and good efficiency. It integrates the merit of words and word bigrams. 
Using words as features in the first step aims at its better statistical coverage, -- the 
500 selected features in the first step can treat a majority of documents, constituting 
63.13% of the test set. On the other hand, using word bigrams as features in the sec-
ond step aims at its better discriminating capability, although the number of features 
becomes comparatively large (3000). Comparing Method-5 with Method-2, Method-3 
and Method-4, we find that the two-step approach is superior to either using only one 
kind of features (word or word bigram) in the classifier, or using the mixture of two 
kinds of features in one step. 
3   Extending the Two-Step Approach to the Multi-class TC 
We extend the two-step method presented in Section 2 to handle the multi-class TC 
now. The idea is to transfer the multi-class TC to the two-class TC. Similar to two-
class TC, the emphasis is still on the misclassified documents given by a classifier, 
though we use a modified multi-class Na?ve Bayesian Classifier here.

where MVi stands for the likelihood of assigning a label ci?C to the document d,  
MVmax_F and MVmax_S are the maximum and the second maximum over all MVi 
(i?|C|) respectively. We approximately rewrite (10) as: 
SF MVMVdf max_max_)( ?=           (14) 
We try to transfer the multi-class TC described by (10) into a two-class TC de-
scribed by (14). Formula (14) means that the binary-valued multi-class Na?ve Bayes-
ian Classifier can be approximately regarded as searching a separate line in a two-
dimensional space with MVmax_F being the X-coordinate and MVmax_S being the Y-
coordinate. The distance from a given document, represented as a point (x, y) with the 
values of x and y calculated according to (12) and (13) respectively, to the separate 
line in this two-dimensional space will be:  
      y)(xDist ?=
2
1
    (15) 
The value of Dist directly reflects the degree of confidence of assigning the label c* 
to the document d. 
The distribution of a training set (refer to Section 3.2) regarding Dist in this two-
dimensional space, and, consequently, the fuzzy area for the Na?ve Bayesian Classi-
fier, are observed and identified, similar to its counterpart in Section 2.2.  
3.2   Experiments on the Multi-class TC 
We construct a dataset, including 5 categories and the total of 17756 Chinese docu-
ments. The document numbers of five categories are 4192, 6968, 2080, 3175 and 
308 X. Fan et al 
1800 respectively, among which the last three categories have the high degree of 
ambiguity each other. The dataset is split into four parts randomly, one as the test set 
and the other three as the training set. We again run the five methods described in 
Section 2.2 on this dataset. The strategy of determining the number of features also 
follows that used in Section 2.2. The experimentally determined numbers of features 
regarding the five methods are 8000, 400, 5000, 800 and 400 + 9000 (the first step +  
the second step) respectively. 
The average precision, average recall and average F1 over the five categories are 
used to evaluate the experimental results, as shown in Table 2. 
Table 2.  Performance comparisons of the five methods in multi-class TC 
 
We can see from Table 2 that the very similar conclusions as that in the two-class 
TC in Section 2.2 can be obtained here: 
1) Formula (8) is superior to (9) in feature reduction. This comes from the per-
formance comparison between Method-2 and Method-1: the former has higher per-
formance and higher efficiency that the latter (the average F1, 97.20% vs. 91.48%, and 
the number of features used, 400 vs. 8000). 
2) Word bigrams as features have better discriminating capability than words as 
features, along with more serious data sparseness. The performances of Method-3 and 
Method-4, which use Chinese word bigrams and the mixture of words and word bi-
grams as features respectively, are higher than that of Method-2, which only uses 
Chinese words as features. But the number of features used in Method-3 is much 
more than those used in Method-2 and Method-4 (5000 vs. 400 and 800). 
3) The proposed method (Methond-5) has the best performances and acceptable ef-
ficiency. In term of the average F1, the performance is improved from the baseline 
91.48% (Method-1) to 98.56% (Method-5). In the first step in Method-5, the number 
of feature set is small (only 400), but a majority of documents can be treated by it. 
The number of features exploited in Method-5 is the highest among the five methods 
(9000), but it is still acceptable. 
4   Using Dependences Among Features in Two-Step 
Categorization  
In this section, a two-step text categorization method taking the dependences among 
features into account is presented. We do the same task with the Na?ve Bayesian Clas-
sifier in the first step, exactly same as what we did in Section 2 and Section 3. In the 
 Classifying Chinese Texts in Two Steps 309 
second step, each document identified unreliable in the first step are further processed 
by exploring the dependences among features. This is realized by a model named the 
Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier. 
4.1   The Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (CNB) 
The Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (CNB) is an improved Na?ve Bayesian Clas-
sifier. It contains two additional parts, i.e., the k-dependence feature list and the fea-
ture causality diagram. The former is used to represent the dependence relation among 
features, and the latter is used to estimate the probability distribution of a feature 
dynamically while taking its dependences into account.  
K-Dependence Feature List (K-DFL): CNB allows each feature node Y to have a 
maximum of k features nodes as parents that constitute the k-dependence feature list 
representing the dependences among features. In other words, ?(Y) = {Yd, C}, where 
Yd is the set of at most k features nodes, C is the category node, and ?(C) =?. 
Note that we can build a K-DFL for each feature under each class ct, which repre-
sents different dependence relations under different class.  
Obviously, there exists a 0-dependence feature list for every feature in the Na?ve 
Bayesian Classifier, from the definition of K-DFL. 
The algorithm of constructing K-DFL is as follows: Given the maximum depend-
ence number k, mutual information threshold ? and the class ct. For each feature Y, 
repeat the follow steps. 1) Compute class conditional mutual information MI(Yi, Yj| 
ct), for every pair of features Yi and Yj, where i?j. 2) Construct the set Si={ Yj | 
MI(Yi, Yj| ct) > ?}. 3) Let m= min (k, | Si|), select the top m features as K-DFL  
from Si. 
Feature Causality Diagram (FCD): CNB allows each feature Y, which occurs in a 
given document, to have a Feature Causality Diagram (FCD). FCD is a double-layer 
directed diagram, in which the first layer has only the feature node Y, and the second 
layer allows to have multiple nodes that include the class node C and the correspond-
ing dependence node set S of Y. Here, S=Sd?SF, Sd is the K-DFL node set of Y and 
SF={Xi| Xi is a feature node that occurs in the given document. There exists a directed 
arc from every node Xi at the second layer to the node Y at the first layer. The arc is 
called causality link event Li which represents the causality intensity between node Y 
and Xi, and the probability of Li is pi=Pr{Li}=Pr{Y=1|Xi=1}. The relation among all 
arcs is logical OR. The Feature Causality Diagram can be considered as a sort of 
simplified causality diagram [9][10]. 
Suppose feature Y?s FCD is G, and it parent node set S={X1, X2,?,Xm } (m?1) in 
G, we can estimate the conditional probability as follows while considering the de-
pendences among features:

nary-valued vector d=(X1 ,X2 , ?,X|d|), divide the features into two sets X1 and X2, 
X1= {Xi| Xi=1} and X2= {Xj| Xj=0}. The Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier can be

4.2   Experiments on CNB 
As mentioned earlier, the first step remains unchanged as that in Section 2 and Sec-
tion 3. The difference is in the second step: for the documents identified unreliable in 
the first step, we apply the Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier to handle them. 
We use two datasets in the experiments. one is the two-class dataset described in 
Section 2.2, called Dataset-I, and the other one is the multi-class dataset described in 
Section 3.2, called Dataset-I. 
To evaluate CNB and compare all methods presented in this paper, we experiment 
the following methods:  
1) Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (NB), i.e., the method-2 in Section 2.2;  
2) CNB without exploring the two-step strategy;  
3) The two-step strategy: NB and CNB in the first and second step (TS-CNB);  
4) Limited Dependence Bayesian Classifier (DNB) [11];  
5) Method-5 in Section 2.2 and Section 3.2 (denoted TS-DF here).  
Experimental results for two-class Dataset-I and multi-class Dataset-II are listed in 
Table3 and Table 4. The data for NB and TS-DF are derived from the corresponding 
columns of Table 1 and Table 2. The parameters in CNB and TS-CNB are that the 
dependence number k=1 and 5, the threshold?= 0.0545 and 0.0045 for Dataset-I and 
Dataset-II respectively. The parameters in DNB are that dependence number k=1and 
3, the threshold?= 0.0545 and 0.0045 for Dataset-I and Dataset-II respectively. 
Table 3.  Performance comparisons in two-class Dataset-I 
 
Table 3 and Table 4 demonstrate that 1) The  performance of the Na?ve Bayesian 
Classifier can be improved by taking the dependences among features into account, as 
evidenced by the fact that CNB, TS-CNB and DNB outperform NB. By tracing the 
experiment, we find an interesting phenomenon, as expected: for the documents  
 Classifying Chinese Texts in Two Steps 311 
identified reliable by NB, CNB cannot improve it, but for those identified unreliable 
by NB, CNB can improve it. The reason should be even though NB and CNB use the 
same features, but CNB uses the dependences among features additionally. 2) CNB 
and TS-CNB have the same capability in effectiveness, but TS-CNB has a higher 
computational efficiency. As stated earlier, TS-CNB uses NB to classify documents in 
the reliable area and then uses CNB to classify documents in the unreliable area. At 
the first glance, the efficiency of TS-CNB seems lower than that of using CNB only 
because the former additionally uses NB in the first step, but in fact, a majority of 
documents (e.g., 63.13% of the total documents in dataset-I) fall into the reliable area 
and are then treated by NB successfully (obviously, NB is higher than CNB in effi-
ciency) in the first step, so they will never go to the second step, resulting in a higher 
computational efficiency of TS-CNB than CNB. 3) The performances of CNB, TS-
CNB and DNB are almost identical, among which, the efficiency of TS-CNB is the 
highest. And, the efficiency of CNB is higher than that of DNB, because CNB uses a 
simpler network structure than DNB, with the same learning and inference formalism. 
4) TS-DF has the highest performance among the all. Meanwhile, the ranking of 
computational efficiency (in descending order) is NB, TS-DF, TS-CNB, CNB,  
and DNB.

Combining multiple methodologies or representations has been studied in several 
areas of information retrieval so far, for example, retrieval effectiveness can be im-
proved by using multiple representations [12]. In the area of text categorization in 
particular, many methods of combining different classifiers have been developed. For 
example, Yang et al [13] used simple equal weights for normalized score of each 
classifier output so as to integrate multiple classifiers linearly in the domain of Topic 
Detection and Tracking; Hull at al. [14] used linear combination for probabilities or 
log odds scores of multiple classifier output in the context of document filtering. Lar-
key et al [15] used weighted linear combination for system ranks and scores of multi-
ple classifier output in the medical document domain; Li and Jain [16] used voting 
and classifier selection technique including dynamic classifier selection and adaptive 
classifier. Lam and Lai [17] automatically selected a classifier for each category based 
on the category-specific statistical characteristics. Bennett et al [18] used voting, 
classifier-selection techniques and a hierarchical combination method with  
reliability indicators.

6   Conclusions 
The issue of how to classify Chinese documents characterized by high degree ambi-
guity from text categorization?s point of view is a challenge. For this issue, this paper 
presents two solutions in a uniform two-step framework, which makes use of the 
distributional characteristics of misclassified documents, that is, most of the misclas-
sified documents are near to the separate line between categories. The first solution is 
a two-step TC approach based on the Na?ve Bayesian Classifier. The second solution 
is to further introduce the dependences among features into the model, resulting in a 
two-step approach based on the so-called Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier. Ex-
periments show that the second solution is superior to the Na?ve Bayesian Classifier, 
and is equal to CNB without exploring two-step strategy in performance, but has a 
higher computational efficiency than the latter. The first solution has the best per-
formance in all the experiments, outperforming all other methods (including the sec-
ond solution): in the two-class experiments, its F1 increases from the baseline 82.67% 
to the final 95.54%, and in the multi-class experiments, its average F1 increases from 
the baseline 91.48% to the final 98.56%. 
In addition, the other two conclusions can be drawn from the experiments: 1) Us-
ing Chinese word bigrams as features has a better discriminating capability than using 
words as features, but more serious data sparseness will be faced; 2) formula (8) is 
superior to (9) in feature reduction in both the two-class and multi-class Chinese text 
categorization. 
It is worth point out that we believe the proposed method is in principle language 
independent, though all the experiments are performed on Chinese datasets.
