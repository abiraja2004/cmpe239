Abstract 
This demonstration  provides a historical 
perspective of a number of  research and 
commercial systems in Spoken Language 
Technology over the past 20+ years.  A 
series of chronologically ordered video 
clips from many sources will  be  pre-
sented to illustrate the many steps and the 
tremendous progress that has been 
achieved over the years. The clips them-
selves are drawn from diverse academic 
and commercial research labs, product 
presentations, and user applications. All 
show systems being demonstrated  or in 
actual use. Over 20 different laboratory 
systems, products, and companies are rep-
resented in this collection of video mate-
rials. Each of the clips has previously 
been shown publicly. The present selec-
tion primarily focuses on speech and 
natural language systems for speech rec-
ognition and synthesis. Additional contri-
butions to this collection are welcome.

2.   Introduction 
 
This demonstration is intended to increase aware-
ness and understanding of the Spoken Language 
Technology field, and an appreciation of the evolu-
tionary and revolutionary steps which have turned 
pipedreams of the past into present products, and 
future promise. The progression of many stages 
from research and commercial laboratories into 
working systems are well illustrated by this collec-
tion of video clips. Each video clip (typically 1-5 
minutes duration) represents technology at the cut-
ting edge.  There are 3 categories of video clips: 
1) Laboratory and Prototype Systems  
In some cases, pioneers and major contributors of 
the field are personally demonstrating their sys-
tems. 
2) Commercial Product Demonstrations 
These run the gamut of televised inter-
views/demonstrations (including many live demos) 
to instructional and commercial videos.

3) User Applications  
Here users are demonstrating how they use their 
systems on a routine basis in a variety of diverse 
applications. 
 
3.   Hardware 
 
With the advent of ever more powerful inexpen-
sive silicon and the integration of computers with 
audio interfaces, the computing platforms on 
which spoken language technology resides have 
undergone dramatic changes, progressively reach-
ing many more users, ever more conveniently. 
Over the past 30+ years, we have witnessed the 
transition from monolithic room-filling computers 
to personal, even hand-held devices supporting 
state-of-the-art speech technology. The type and 
scope of applications have concomitantly multi-
plied with the ready access of affordable useful 
technology. Like other initially expensive central-
ized hardware and even biological systems (!), as 
the cost curves come down, evolution progresses, 
and more processing can be conducted relatively or 
wholly autonomously, the processing itself can be 
far more distributed. So while there continue to be 
operations or services (e.g. call centers) which are 
still best done in a centralized fashion, the distribu-
tion and proliferation of stand-alone systems (e.g. 
PCs, and cell phones) become progressively more 
feasible and popular. 
 
4.   Speech Synthesis 
 
The primary focus of the present set of demonstra-
tions is on speech recognition and synthesis. Start-
ing with Homer Dudley's Voder (a manually-
controlled speech synthesizer) at the 1939 World's 
Fair, audio examples of historical speech synthesis 
approaches and techniques clearly demonstrate 
extensive progress (see Resources). Video clips 
illustrate users interacting with different types of 
synthesis systems and applications.  
Mechanical speaking machines in the 1700's 
eventually gave way to electrical devices in the 
early 1920's, which in turn gave way to computer 
generation of speech by the 1960's. The invention 
of the speech spectrogram in the 1940's spurred in-
depth speech research, and significantly facilitated 
speech signal and waveform analyses, which blos-
somed in the 1960's. 
 Speech generation has taken two basic forms. 
With analysis-
resynthesis the speech 
waveform is first 
parameterized and then 
regenerated or played 
back, as in the Voder. 
With  the advent of 
powerful inexpensive 
microprocessors and 
DSP chips in the 
1970's, a multitude  of 
diverse sound-
producing consumer 
products hit the market. 
The popular Speak 'n 
Spell learning toy 
introduced in 1978, was the most notable early en-
try.  
Articulatory synthesis, first demonstrated in 
1958, models the components and the characteris-
tics of the physical production system -  the articu-
lators, their movements and their trajectories, as 
well as the vocal tract, its resonances, excitations, 
etc. A clear understanding of such a system is 
highly desirable, and may eventually be achieved. 
Unfortunately, the underlying complexity of the 
speech production system still confounds under-
standing and application utility. Consequently, 
while studies in articulatory synthesis are still on-
going, they were largely superceded by formant 
synthesizers.  
 Formant synthesis, also referred to as synthesis-
by-rule, characterizes speech in terms of a source-
filter model. In this model, one or more sound 
sources, representing the vibrating vocal cords and 
noise dynamically produced at articulator constric-
tions, excite one or more filters, representing the 
vocal tract and side-tube (e.g. nasal branch, etc.) 
resonances.  A catalog of sounds (corresponding to 
(sub) phones, diphones, or other units) can be con-
structed and then reassembled (and smoothed) in 
accordance with a dictionary of word or phrase 
pronunciations. With careful selection of materials, 
and the careful tuning and adjustments of parame-
ters, synthetic speech can be made to sound very 
natural. Although computationally efficient, auto-
matically achieving high quality output is neither 
easy nor consistently achievable. 
Concatenative synthesis refers to the process of 
sequentially combining prerecorded exemplars of 
speech or other waveforms to produce the desired 
258
output. A large database (including many phonetic 
elements, allophones, words, etc.) of well-
concatenated sound elements can easily produce 
synthetic speech indistinguishable from natural 
speech. This process is very memory-intensive, but  
typically produces the highest quality speech syn-
thesis available. It is widely deployed in applica-
tions requiring natural-sounding speech output 
from a given voice.  
 Although three major approaches are outlined 
here, a number of hybrid synthesizers, HMM syn-
thesizers, and other synthesis methodologies are 
utilized to address different requirements.   
 
5.   Speech Recognition

In the past century, speech recognition has pro-
gressed from recognizing small vocabularies to 
transcribing general purpose dictation in real time, 
recognizing commands in noisy environments, and 
reliably extracting words and information from 
telephone conversations and television broadcasts.  
In 1922, the toy dog "Rex", would spring from his 
doghouse when he 
was called by name!  
Early digit rec-
ognizers were 
demonstrated in the 
1950's and 1960's, 
when the predomi-
nant approach was to 
recognize whole 
word templates. This 
approach continued 
up to the beginning 
of the 1970's when it 
started being 
gradually replaced 
by Hidden Markov 
Model (HMM) sys-
tems using stochastic 
models to more 
accurately characterize the naturally highly vari-
able speech signal.  
 Spurred on by government funders for "speech 
understanding" in Europe, Japan, and the USA, 
many university and commercial laboratories 
commenced to advance the technology. Proceeding 
first through limited vocabulary systems and 
highly constrained grammars, systems gradually 
expanded the number of words they could simulta-
neously distinguish, despite greater variability in 
speakers, languages, and progressively more chal-
lenging acoustic/channel and natural language en-
vironments. Starting in the 1970's, hefty special-
purpose commercial hardware systems were de-
ployed for limited vocabulary industrial applica-
tions (e.g. for hands-free command/control, data 
entry, quality control, etc.), speaker verification, 
simple telephone data input and query systems, etc. 
Inexpensive PC sound board enabling discrete rec-
ognition started appearing in the market by the late 
1970's to mid 1980's. 
 In the latter 1980's, vocabulary expanded to sev-
eral thousand words, and then in 1990, suddenly 
exploded to full general-purpose dictation capabili-
ties, though still limited to discrete "one word at a 
time" input. Meanwhile in the early 1990's, the 
first speech audio-mining and audio information 
retrieval capabilities were successfully proven  to 
work on prerecorded conversational continuous 
speech, on telephone and broadcast data. Real-time 
continuous speech dictation "software only" prod-
ucts became available and sold to millions of cus-
tomers by the end of the 1990's. The availability of 
large corpora of recorded speech and text dramati-
cally improved modeling capabilities and system 
performance for both dictation and transcription.  
 Meantime  telephone query systems allowed for 
users to engage in dialogue to get stock quotes, 
weather updates, and even make train and plane 
reservations. By the year 2000, commercial tele-
phone directory assistance systems started appear-
ing as well. Today call centers routinely employ 
speech technology to elicit and supply customer 
information through interactive spoken dialogue, in 
large part replacing expensive human operators. 
Though directed dialogues predominate, some 
mixed initiative dialogues ("How can I help you?") 
are becoming available. Spoken language transla-
tion programs, coupling speech recognition to ma-
chine translation software, started appearing first in 
the laboratory in the late 1990's, and then pro-
gressed to the marketplace on PCs and handheld 
devices, by about 2000. Major government-funded 
research initiatives are presently focusing on 
speech-to-speech systems with different language 
inputs and outputs.  
 With embedded systems, speech input and out-
put are now available on a growing number of  
consumer products including automotive naviga-
tion systems, PDAs and toys; hands-free voice-
259
dialing is shipping on millions of cell phones. De-
spite funding cuts and other setbacks about year 
2000, the steady stream of ever improving  speech 
technology is gradually becoming an integral part 
of systems and services, large and small. The is-
sues we face in improving speech technology con-
tinue to be very challenging. The retrospective 
afforded by this demonstration reflects on the great 
progress that we have made!
