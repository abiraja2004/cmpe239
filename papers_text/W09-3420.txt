Abstract 
This paper describes semi-automatic construc-
tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method 
for Asian wordNet. Based on the Princeton 
WordNet, we develop a method in generating 
a WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual dic-
tionary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-
lingual dictionary through the English equiva-
lent and its part-of-speech (POS), automati-
cally. Manual translation is also employed af-
ter the alignment. We also develop a web-
based collaborative workbench, called KUI 
(Knowledge Unifying Initiator), for revising 
the result of synset assignment and provide a 
framework to create Asian WordNet via the 
linkage through PWN synset.     
1 Introduction 
The Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbuam, 
1998) is one of the most semantically rich Eng-
lish lexical banks widely used as a resource in 
many research and development. WordNet is a 
great inspiration in the extensive development of 
this kind of lexical database in other languages. 
It is not only an important resource in imple-
menting NLP applications in each language, but 
also in inter-linking WordNets of different lan-
guages to develop multi-lingual applications to 
overcome the language barrier. There are some 
efforts in developing WordNets of some lan-
guages (Atserias and et al, 1997; Vossen, 1997; 
Farrers and et al, 1998; Balkova and et al, 2004; 
Isahara and et al, 2008). But the number of lan-
guages that have been successfully developed  
 
 
 
their WordNets is still limited to some active 
research in this area. This paper, however, is the 
one of that attempt.  
This paper describes semi-automatic construc-
tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method for 
Asian WordNet. Based on the Princeton Word-
Net, we develop a method in generating a 
WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual diction-
ary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-lingual 
dictionary through the English equivalent and its 
part-of-speech (POS), automatically. Manual 
translation is also employed after the alignment. 
We also develop a web-based collaborative 
workbench, called KUI (Knowledge Unifying 
Initiator), for revising the result of synset as-
signment and provide a framework to create 
Asian WordNet via the linkage through PWN 
synset. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 describes how we construct the Thai 
WordNet, including approaches, methods, and 
some significant language dependent issues ex-
perienced along the construction. Section 3 pro-
vides the information on Asian WordNet con-
struction and progress. And Section 4 concludes 
our work.  
2 Thai WordNet Construction Proce-
dure 
Different approaches and methods have been 
applied in constructing WordNet of many lan-
guages according to the existing lexical re-
sources. This section describes how Thai Word-
Net is constructed either approach or method. 
139
2.1 Approaches 
To build language WordNet from scratch, two 
approaches were brought up into the discussion: 
the merge approach and the expand approach.  
The merge approach is to build the taxonomies 
of the language; synsets and relations, and then 
map to the PWN by using the English equivalent 
words from existing bilingual dictionaries.  
The expand approach is to map or translate lo-
cal words directly to the PWN's synsets by using 
the existing bilingual dictionaries. 
Employing the merge approach, for Thai as an 
example, we will completely get synsets and re-
lations for the Thai language. But it is time and 
budget consuming task and require a lot of 
skilled lexicographers as well, while less time 
and budget is used when employing the expand 
approach to get a translated version of WordNet. 
But some particular Thai concepts which do not 
occur in PWN will not exist in this lexicon. 
Comparing between these two approaches, the 
Thai WordNet construction intended to follow 
the expand approach by this following reasons; 
 
z Many languages have developed their 
own WordNet using the PWN as a 
model, so we can link Thai lexical data-
base to those languages.  
z The interface for collaboration for other 
languages can be easily developed. 
2.2 Methods 
As presented above, we follow the expand ap-
proach to construct the Thai WordNet by trans-
lating the synsets in the PWN to the Thai lan-
guage. Both automatic and manual methods are 
applied in the process.  
2.2.1 Automatic Synset Alignment  
Following the objective to translate the PWN to 
Thai, we attempted to use the existing lexical 
resources to facilitate the construction. We pro-
posed an automatic method to assign an appro-
priate synset to a lexical entry by considering its 
English equivalent and lexical synonyms which 
are most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual dic-
tionary. (Charoenporn 2008; Sornlertlamvanich, 
2008).

Table 1. Synset assignment to entries in 
Thai-English dictionary 
 
For the result, there is only 12% of the total 
number of the synsets that were able to be as-
signed to Thai lexical entries. And about 24% of 
Thai lexical entries were found with the English 
equivalents that meet one of our criteria. Table 1 
shows the successful rate in assigning synsets to 
the lexical entry in the Thai-English Dictionary.  
Considering the list of unmapped lexical entry, 
the errors can be classified into three groups, as 
the following. 
1. The English equivalent is assigned in a 
compound, especially in case that there 
is no an appropriate translation to repre-
sent exactly the same sense. For exam-
ple, 
L: ??????????? raan3-khaa3-pleek1 
E: retail shop 
2. Some particular words culturally used I 
one language may not be simply trans-
lated into one single word sense in Eng-
lish. In this case, we found it explained 
in a phrase. For example,  
L: ???????? kan0-jeak1 
E: bouquet worn over the ear  
3. Inflected forms i.e. plural, past partici-
ple, are used to express an appropriate 
sense of a lexical entry. This can be 
found in non-inflection languages such 
as Thai and most of Asian languages, 
For example,  
L: ???????? raaw3-ra0-thom0 
E: greived 
By using this method, a little part of PWN has 
been translated into Thai. About 88% of the total 
number of the synsets still cannot be assigned.   
Manual step is therefore applied.   
140
2.2.2 Manual Construction 
Human translation is our next step for synset 
translation. Two important issues were taken into 
discussion, when starting the translation process.  
Those are; 
? How to assign or translate new concepts 
that still do not occur in the Thai lexicon. 
Compound word or phrase is acceptable 
or not. 
? Which equivalent do we need to consider, 
synset-to-synset equivalent or word-to-
word equivalent? 
For the first issue, we actually intend to trans-
late the PWN synsets into single Thai word only. 
But problems occurred when we faced with con-
cept that has not its equivalent word. For exam-
ple, 
  
filly#1 -- (a young female horse under the age 
of four) 
colt2#1 ? (a young male horse under the age 
of four) 
hog2#2, hogget#1, hogg#2 ? (a sheep up to 
the age of one year: one yet to be sheared) 
 
There is not any word that conveys the mean-
ing of the above concepts. That is because of the 
difference of the culture. In this case, phrase or 
compound word will be introduced to use as the 
equivalent word of the concept. This phenome-
non always occurs with cultural dependent con-
cept, technical terms and new concepts.  
As for the second issue, considering between 
(1) synset-to-synset equivalent assignment or (2) 
word-to-word equivalent assignment has to be 
discussed. Let consider the following concept of 
?dog? in the PWN. 
 
dog#1, domestic dog#1, Canis familiaris#1 -- 
(a member of the genus Canis (probably de-
scended from the common wolf) that has been 
domesticated by man since prehistoric times; 
occurs in many breeds; "the dog barked all 
night")  
 
The above synset consists of three words; dog, 
domestic dog, and Canis familiaris. The set of 
Thai synonyms that is equivalent to this English 
synset is the following. 
 
Thai synset of ?dog? 
{T1 ??? maa4 ?dog? (normal word),  
  T2 ????? su1-nak3 ?dog? (polite word),  
  T3 ????????? su1-nak3-baan0 ?domestic dog?,  
  T4 ????? ??????????? kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-lia0-ris3 
?Canis familiaris?} 
These words have the same concepts but are 
different in usage. How do we choose the right 
Thai word for the right equivalent English word? 
It is a crucial problem. In the paragraph below, 
three English words which represent the concept 
?dog? are used in the different context and can-
not be interchanged. Similarly, T1, T2 and T3 
cannot be used substitutionally. Because it con-
veys different meaning. Therefore, word-to-word 
is our solution.   
 
?...Dog usually means the domestic dog, 
Canis lupus familiaris (or "Canis familiaris" in 
binomial nomenclature)....? 
 
Dog  T1 ??? maa4 ?dog?,  
T2 ????? su1-nak3 ?dog?   
Domestic dog  T3 ????????? 
su1-nak4-baan0  
?domestic dog? 
Canis familiaris T4 ????? ???????????  
kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-
lia0-ris3 
?Canis familiaris? 
 
    Consequently, word-to-word equivalent is 
very useful for choosing the right synonyms with 
the right context. 
     In conclusion, the main principle for the Eng-
lish to Thai translation includes 
(1) ?Single word? is lexicalized the existence 
of concepts in Thai.  
(2) ?Compound? or ?Phrase? is represented 
some concepts that are not lexicalized in 
Thai. 
(3) Synset-to-synset equivalent is used for 
finding Thai synset that is compatible 
with PWN synset. 
(4) Word-to-word equivalent is used for find-
ing the right Thai word that is compatible 
with PWN word in each synset.  
2.3 Language Issues  
This section describes some significant charac-
teristics of Thai that we have to consider care-
fully during the translation process.    
 
141
2.3.1 Out of concepts in PWN 
There are some Thai words/concepts that do not 
exist in the PWN, especially cultural-related 
words. This is the major problem we have to 
solve during the translation.  
One of our future plans is to add synsets that 
do not exist into the PWN.  
2.3.2 Concept differentiation 
Some concepts in the PWN are not equal to Thai 
concepts. For example, a synset {appear, come 
out} represents one concept ?be issued or pub-
lished? in English, but meanwhile, it represents 
two concepts in Thai, the concept of printed mat-
ter, and the concept of film or movie, respec-
tively.   
2.3.3 Concept Structure differentiation 
In some cases, the level of the concept relation 
between English and Thai is not equal. For ex-
ample, {hair} in the PWN represents a concept 
of ?a covering for the body (or parts of it) con-
sisting of a dense growth of threadlike structures 
(as on the human head); helps to prevent heat 
loss; ?? but in Thai, it is divided into two con-
cepts;  
 
T1 ?? khon4 ?hair? 
= ?hair? that cover the body  
T2 ?? phom4 ?hair? 
= ?hair? that cover on the human head  
 
This shows the nonequivalent of concept. 
Moreover, it also differs in the relation of con-
cept. In PWN ?hair? is a more general concept 
and ?body hair? is more specific concepts. But in 
Thai T1 ?? khon4 ?hair? (hair that covers the 
body) is more general concept and T2 ?? phom5 
?hair? (hair that covers on the human head) is 
more specific one.  
2.3.4 Grammar and usage differentiation  
? Part of speech  
? ?Classifier? is one of Thai POS 
which indicates the semantic 
class to which an item belongs. 
It's widely use in quantitative 
expression. For example, ??? 
knon? used with 'person', ????? 
lang? used with house. 
? Some adjectives in English, such 
as ?beautiful?, 'red' and so on can 
function as the adjective and at-
tribute verb in Thai.  
? Social factors determining language us-
age 
? In Thai, some social factors, 
such as social status, age, or sex 
play an important role to deter-
mine the usage of language. For 
example, these following three 
words ??? kin0, ??? chan4 and ???? 
sa0-waey4, having the same 
meaning ?eat?, are used for dif-
ferent social status of the listener 
or referent. These words cannot 
be grouped in the same synset 
because of their usage. 
3 From Thai to Asian WordNet  
AWN, or Asian WordNet, is the result of the col-
laborative effort in creating an interconnected 
WordNet for Asian languages. Starting with the 
automatic synset assignment as shown in section 
2, we provide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initia-
tor) (Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlam-
vanich et al, 2007) to establish an online col-
laborative work in refining the WorNets. KUI is 
community software which allows registered 
members including language experts revise and 
vote for the synset assignment. The system man-
ages the synset assignment according to the pre-
ferred score obtained from the revision process. 
As a result, the community WordNets will be 
accomplished and exported into the original form 
of WordNet database. Via the synset ID assigned 
in the WordNet, the system can generate a cross 
language WordNet result. Through this effort, an 
initial version of Asian WordNet can be fulfilled.

3.2 How words are linked 
In our language WordNet construction, lexical 
entry of each language will be mapped with the 
PWN via its English equivalent. On the process 
of mapping, a unique ID will be generated for 
every lexical entry which contains unique 
sense_key and synset_offset from PWN. Exam-
ples of the generated ID show in Table 2. When 
a word with a unique ID is translated into any 
language, the same unique ID will be attached to 
that word automatically. By this way, the lexicon 
entry in the community can be linked to the each 
other using this unique ID.

3.3 Progress on Thai WordNet and Asian 
WordNet 
This section presents the progress on Asian 
WordNet and Thai WordNet construction. 
3.3.1 Current Asian WordNet 
At present, there are ten Asian languages in the 
community. The amount of the translated synsets 
has been continuously increased. The current 
amount is shown in the table 3. As shown in the 
table, for example, 28,735 senses from 117,659 
senses have been translated into Thai.

3.3.3 Amount of Words in Thai synsets  
From the synset in Thai WordNet, there are the 
minimum of one word (W1) in a synset and the 
maximum of six words (W6) in a synset. The 
percentage shown in Table 5 presents that 
89.78% of Thai synset contain only one word.

4 Conclusion  
In this paper we have described the methods of 
Thai WordNet construction. The semi-auto 
alignment method constructed the database by 
using the electronic bilingual dictionary. The 
manual method has constructed by experts and 
the collaborative builders who works on the web 
interface at www.asianwordnet.org.
