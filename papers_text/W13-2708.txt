Abstract
We develop a pipeline consisting of var-
ious text processing tools which is de-
signed to assist political scientists in find-
ing specific, complex concepts within
large amounts of text. Our main focus is
the interaction between the political scien-
tists and the natural language processing
groups to ensure a beneficial assistance for
the political scientists and new application
challenges for NLP. It is of particular im-
portance to find a ?common language? be-
tween the different disciplines. Therefore,
we use an interactive web-interface which
is easily usable by non-experts. It inter-
faces an active learning algorithm which
is complemented by the NLP pipeline to
provide a rich feature selection. Political
scientists are thus enabled to use their own
intuitions to find custom concepts.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we give examples of how NLP meth-
ods and tools can be used to provide support for
complex tasks in political sciences. Many con-
cepts of political science are complex and faceted;
they tend to come in different linguistic realiza-
tions, often in complex ones; many concepts are
not directly identifiable by means of (a small set
of) individual lexical items, but require some in-
terpretation.
Many researchers in political sciences either
work qualitatively on small amounts of data which
they interpret instance-wise, or, if they are in-
terested in quantitative trends, they use compara-
tively simple tools, such as keyword-based search
in corpora or text classification on the basis of
terms only; this latter approach may lead to im-
precise results due to a rather unspecific search as
well as semantically invalid or ambigious search
words. On the other hand, large amounts of e.g.
news texts are available, also over longer periods
of time, such that e.g. tendencies over time can
be derived. The corpora we are currently working
on contain ca. 700,000 articles from British, Irish,
German and Austrian newspapers, as well as (yet
unexplored) material in French.
Figure 1 depicts a simple example of a quantita-
tive analysis.1 The example shows how often two
terms, Friedensmission(?peace operation?), and
Auslandseinsatz(?foreign intervention?) are used
in the last two decades in newspaper texts about
interventions and wars. The long-term goal of the
project is to provide similar analysis for complex
concepts. An example of a complex concept is
the evocation of collective identities in political
contexts, as indirect in the news. Examples for
such collective identities are: the Europeans, the
French, the Catholics.
The objective of the work we are going to dis-
cuss in this paper is to provide NLP methods and
tools for assisting political scientists in the ex-
ploration of large data sets, with a view to both,
a detailed qualitative analysis of text instances,
and a quantitative overview of trends over time,
at the level of corpora. The examples discussed
here have to do with (possibly multiple) collective
identities. Typical context of such identities tend
to report communication, as direct or as indirect
speech. Examples of such contexts are given in 1.

The tool support is meant to be semi-automatic,
as the automatic tools propose candidates that
need to be validated or refused by the political sci-
entists.
We combine a chain of corpus processing tools
with classifier-based tools, e.g. for topic clas-
sifiers, commentary/report classifiers, etc., make
the tools interoperable to ensure flexible data ex-
change and multiple usage scenarios, and we em-
bed the tool collection under a web (service) -
based user interface.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. In section 2, we present an outline of the ar-
chitecture of our tool collection, and we motivate
the architecture. Section 3 presents examples of
implemented modules, both from corpus process-
ing and search and retrieval of instances of com-
plex concepts. We also show how our tools are re-
lated to the infrastructural standards in use in the
CLARIN community. In section 4, we exemplify
the intended use of the methods with case studies
about steps necessary for identifying evocation:
being able to separate reports from comments, and
strategies for identifying indirect speech. Section
6 is devoted to a conclusion and to the discussion
of future work.
2 Project Goals
A collaboration between political scientists and
computational linguists necessarily involves find-
ing a common language in order to agree on
the precise objectives of a project. For exam-
ple, social scientists use the term codebook for
manual annotations of text, similar to annotation
schemes or guidelines in NLP. Both disciplines
share methodologies of interactive text analysis
which combine term based search, manual an-
notation and learning-based annotation of large
amounts of data. In this section, we give a brief
56
summary of the goals from the perspective of each
of the two disciplines, and then describe the text
corpus that is used in the project. Section 3 will
describe our approach to devising a system archi-
tecture that serves to realize the goals.
2.1 Social Science Research Issue
Given the complexity of the underlying research
issues (cf. Section 1) and the methodological tra-
dition of manual text coding by very well-trained
annotators in the social science and particular in
political science, our project does not aim at any
fully-automatic solution for empirical issues in po-
litical science. Instead, the goal is to provide as
much assistance to the human text analyst as possi-
ble, by means of a workbench that integrates many
tasks that otherwise would have to be carried out
with different software tools (e.g., corpus prepro-
cessing, KWIC searches, statistics). In our project,
the human analyst is concerned specifically with
manifestations of collective identities in newspa-
per texts on issues of war and military interven-
tions: who are the actors in political crisis man-
agement or conflict? How is this perspective of
responsible actors characterized in different news-
papers (with different political orientation; in dif-
ferent countries)? The analyst wants to find doc-
uments that contain facets of such constellations,
which requires search techniques involving con-
cepts on different levels of abstraction, ranging
from specific words or named entities (which may
appear with different names in different texts) to
event types (which may be realized with different
verb-argument configurations). Thus the text cor-
pus should be enriched with information relevant
to such queries, and the workbench shall provide
a comfortable interface for building such queries.
Moreover, various types and (possibly concurrent)
layers of human annotations have to complement
the automatic analysis, and the manual annota-
tion would benefit from automatic control of code-
book2 compliance and the convergence of coding
decisions.
2.2 Natural Language Processing Research
Issue
Large collections of text provide an excellent op-
portunity for computational linguists to scale their
methods. In the scenario of a project like ours, this
becomes especially challenging, because standard
2or, in NLP terms: annotation scheme.
automatic analysis components have to be com-
bined with manual annotation or interactive inter-
vention of the human analyst.
In addition to this principled challenge, there
may be more mundane issues resulting from pro-
cessing corpora whose origin stretches over many
years. In our case, the data collection phase coin-
cided with a spelling reform in German-speaking
countries. Many aspects of spelling changed twice
(in 1996 and in 2006), and thus it is the responsi-
bility of the NLP branch of the project to provide
an abstraction over such changes and to enable to-
day?s users to run a homogeneous search over the
texts using only the current spelling. While this
might be less important for generic web search ap-
plications, it is of great importance for our project,
where the overall objective is a combination of
quantitative and qualitative text analysis.
In our processing chain, we first need to harmo-
nize the data formats so that the processing tools
operate on a common format. Rather than defin-
ing these from scratch, we aim at compatibility
with the standardization efforts of CLARIN3 and
DARIAH4, two large language technology infras-
tructure projects in Europe that in particular target
eHumanities applications. One of the objectives
is to provide advanced tools to discover, explore,
exploit, annotate, analyse or combine textual re-
sources. In the next section we give more details
about how we interact which the CLARIN-D in-
frastructure (Boehlke et al, 2013).
3 Architecture
The main goal is to provide a web-based user-
interface to the social scientist to avoid any soft-
ware installation. Figure 2 presents the workflow
of the different processing steps in this project.
The first part considers format issues that occur
if documents from different sources are used. The
main challenge is to recognize metadata correctly.
Date and source name are two types of metadata
which are required for analyses in the social sci-
ences. But also the separation of document con-
tent (text) and metadata is important to ensure that
only real content is processed with the NLP meth-
ods. The results are stored in a repository which
uses a relational database as a back-end. All fur-
ther modules are used to add more annotations to
the textual data. First a complex linguistic pro-

57
cessing chain is used to provide state-of-the-art
corpus linguistic annotations (see Section 3.2 for
details). Then, to ensure that statistics over oc-
currence counts of words, word combinations and
constructions are valid and not blurred by the mul-
tiple presence of texts or text passages in the cor-
pus, we filter duplicates. Duplicates can occur
if our document set contains the same document
twice or if two documents are very similar, e.g.
they differ in only one sentence.

We split the workflow for the user into two
parts: The first part is only used if the user im-
ports new data into the repository. For that he
can use the exploration workbench (Section 3.1).
Secondly, all steps for analyzing the data are done
with the Complex Concept Builder (Section 3.2).
3.1 Exploration Workbench
Formal corpus inhomogeneity (e.g. various data
formats and inconsistent data structures) are a ma-
jor issue for researchers working on text corpora.
The web-based ?Exploration Workbench? allows
for the creation of a consistent corpus from vari-
ous types of data and prepares data for further pro-
cessing with computational linguistic tools. The
workbench can interact with to existing computa-
tional linguistic infrastructure (e.g. CLARIN) and
provides input for the repository also used by the
Complex Concept Builder.
The workbench converts several input formats
(TXT, RTF, HTML) to a consistent XML repre-
sentation. The conversion tools account for differ-
ent file encodings and convert input files to Uni-
code (UTF-8). We currently work on newspa-
per articles wrapped with metadata. Text mining
components read out those metadata and identify
text content in the documents. Metadata appear
at varying positions and in diverse notations, e.g.
for dates, indications of authors or newspaper sec-
tions. The components account for these varia-
tions and convert them to a consistent machine
readable format. The extracted metadata are ap-
pended to the XML representation. The result-
ing XML is the starting point for further compu-
tational linguistic processing of the source docu-
ments.
The workbench contains a tool to identify text
duplicates and semi-duplicates via similarity mea-
sures of pairs of articles (Kantner et al, 2011).
The method is based on a comparison of 5-grams,
weighted by significance (tf-idf measure (Salton
and Buckley, 1988)). For a pair of documents it
yields a value on a ?similarity scale? ranging from
0 to 1. Values at medium range (0.4 to 0.8) are
considered semi-duplicates.
Data cleaning is important for the data-driven
studies. Not only duplicate articles have a nega-
tive impact, also articles which are not of interest
for the given topic have to be filtered out. There
are different approaches to classify articles into a
range of predefined topics. In the last years LDA
(Blei et al, 2003; Niekler and Ja?hnichen, 2012)
is one of the most successful methods to find top-
ics in articles. But for social scientists the cate-
gories typically used in LDA are not sufficient. We
follow the idea of Dualist (Settles, 2011; Settles
and Zhu, 2012) which is an interactive method for
classification. The architecture of Dualist is based
on MALLET (McCallum, 2002) which is easily
integrable into our architecture. Our goal is to
design the correct feature to find relevant articles
for a given topic. Word features are not sufficient
since we have to model more complex features (cf.
Section 2.1).
The workbench is not exclusively geared to the
data of the current project. We chose a modular
set-up of the tools of the workbench and provide
user-modifiable templates for the extraction of var-
ious kinds of metadata, in order to keep the work-
bench adaptable to new data and to develop tools
suitable for data beyond the scope of the current
corpus.

3.2 Complex Concept Builder
A central problem for political scientists who in-
tend to work on large corpora is the linguistic va-
riety in the expression of technical terms and com-
plex concepts. An editorial or a politician cited
in a news item can mobilize a collective identity
which can be construed from e.g. regional or so-
cial affiliation, nationality or religion. A reason-
able goal in the context of the search for collec-
tive identity evocation contexts is therefore to find
all texts which (possibly) contain collective iden-
tities. Moreover, while we are training our inter-
active tools on a corpus on wars and military in-
terventions the same collective identities might be
expressed in different ways in a corpus i.e. on the
Eurocrisis.
From a computational point of view, many dif-
ferent tools need to be joined to detect interest-
ing texts. An example application could be a case
where a political scientist intends to extract news-
paper articles that cite a politician who tries to
rally support for his political party. In order to
detect such text, we need a system to identify di-
rect and indirect speech and a sentiment system to
determine the orientation of the statement. These
systems in turn need various kinds of preprocess-
ing starting from tokenization over syntactic pars-
ing up to coreference resolution. The Complex
Concept Builder is the collection of all these sys-
tems with the goal to assist the political scientists.
So far, the Complex Concept Builder imple-
ments tokenization (Schmid, 2009), lemmatisation
(Schmid, 1995), part-of-speech tagging (Schmid
and Laws, 2008), named entity detection (Faruqui
and Pado?, 2010), syntactical parsing (Bohnet,
2010), coreference analysis for German (Lappin
and Leass, 1994; Stuckardt, 2001), relation extrac-
tion (Blessing et al, 2012) and sentiment analysis
for English (Taboada et al, 2011).
It is important for a researcher of the humanities
to be able to adapt existing classification systems
according to his own needs. A common procedure
in both, NLP and political sciences, is to annotate
data. Therefore, one major goal of the project and
the Complex Concept Builder is to provide ma-
chine learning systems with a wide range of pos-
sible features ? including high level information
like sentiment, text type, relations to other texts,
etc. ? that can be used by non-experts for semi-
automatic annotation and text selection. Active
learning is used to provide immediate results that
can then be improved continuously. This aspect
of the Complex Concept Builder is especially im-
portant because new or adapted concepts that may
be looked for can be found without further help of
natural language processing experts.
3.3 Implementation
We decided to use a web-based platform for our
system since the social scientist needs no software
installation and we are independent of the used
operating system. Only a state-of-the-art web-
browser is needed. On the server side, we use a
tomcat installation that interacts with our UIMA
pipeline (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004). A HTML-
rendering component designed in the project (and
parametrizable) allows for a flexible presentation
of the data. A major issue of our work is interac-
tion. To solve this, we use JQuery and AJAX to
dynamically interact between client- and server-
side.
4 Case Study
In this section we explore the interaction between
various sub-systems and how they collaborate to
find complex political concepts. The following
Section 4.1 describes the detection of direct and
indirect speech and its evaluation follows in Sec-
tion 4.2. Section 4.3 is a general exploration of a
few selected sub-systems which require, or benefit
from direct and indirect speech. Finally, Section
4.4 discusses a specific usage scenario for indirect
speech.
4.1 Identifying Indirect Speech
The Complex Concept Builder provides analy-
ses on different linguistic levels (currently mor-
phosyntax, dependency syntax, named entities) of
annotation. We exploit this knowledge to identify
indirect speech along with a mentioned speaker.
Our indirect speech recognizer is based on three
conditions: i) Consider all sentences that contain
at least one word which is tagged as subjunctive
(i.e. ?*.SUBJ?) by the RFTagger. ii) This verb
has to be a direct successor of another verb in the
dependency tree. iii) This verb needs to have a
subject.
Figure 3 depicts the dependency parse tree of
sentence 2.

The mission will be stopped because of the risks to the
unarmed observers, informed Head of Mission Robert
Mood on Saturday.
The speaker of the indirect speech in Sentence
2 is correctly identified as Missionschef (Head of
Mission) and the corresponding verb is teilte mit
(from mitteilen) (to inform).
The parsing-based analysis helps to identify the
speaker of the citation which is a necessary in-
formation for the later interpretation of the cita-
tion. As a further advantage, such an approach
helps to minimize the need of lexical knowledge
for the identification of indirect speech. Our er-
ror analysis below will show that in some cases
a lexicon can help to avoid false positives. A lexi-
con of verbs of communication can easily be boot-
strapped by using our approach to identify candi-
dates for the list of verbs which then restrict the
classifier in order to achieve a higher precision.
4.2 Indirect Speech Evaluation
For a first impression, we present a list of sen-
tences which were automatically annotated as pos-
itive instances by our indirect speech detector.
The sentences were rated by political scientists.
Additionally, for each sentence we extracted the
speaker and the used verb of speech. We man-
ually evaluated 200 extracted triples (sentence,
speaker, verb of speech): The precision of our
system is: 92.5%
Examples 2, 3 and 4 present good candidates
which are helpful for further investigations on col-
lective identities. In example 3 Cardinal Lehmann
is a representative speaker of the Catholic commu-
nity which is a collective identity. Our extracted
sentences accelerate the search for such candidates
which amounts to looking manually for needles in
a haystack.

Examples 5 and 6 show problems of our first
approach. In this case, the speaker is not a person
or an organisation, and the verb is not a verb of
speech.

4.3 Using Indirect Speech
Other modules benefit from the identification of
indirect speech, as can be seen from Sentence 7.
The sentiment system assigns a negative polarity
of ?2.15 to the sentence. The nested sentiment
sources, as described by (Wiebe et al, 2005), of
this sentence require a) a direct speech with the
speaker ?Mazower? and b) an indirect speech with
the speaker ?no one? to be found.5
(7) ?There were serious arguments about what
should happen to the Slavs and Poles in east-
ern Europe,? says Mazower, ?and how many
of them should be sent to the camps and what
proportion could be Germanised . . . No one
ever came out and directly said Hitler had got
it wrong, but there was plenty of implied crit-
icism through comparisons with the Roman
empire. [...]?6
A collective identity evoked in Sentence 7 is
?the Germans?? although the term is not explic-
itly mentioned. This collective identity is de-
scribed as non-homogeneous in the citation and
can be further explored manually by the political
scientists.
The following are further applications of the
identified indirect speeches a) using the frequency
of speeches per text as a feature for classifica-
tion; e.g. a classification system for news re-
ports/commentaries as described in Section 4.4 b)
a project-goal is to find texts in which collective
5The reported sentiment value for the whole sentence is
applicable only to the direct speech. The indirect speech (i.e.
?Hitler had got it wrong?) needs a more fine-grained polarity
score. Since our Complex Concept Builder is very flexible, it
is trivial to score each component separately.

/01/academicexperts.highereducationprofile
identities are mobilised by entities of political de-
bate (i.e. persons, organisations, etc.); the detec-
tion of indirect speech is mandatory for any such
analysis.
4.4 Commentary/Report Classification
A useful distinction for political scientists dealing
with newspaper articles is the distinction between
articles that report objectively on events or back-
grounds and editorials or press commentaries.
We first extracted opinionated and objective
texts from DeReKo corpus (Stede, 2004; Kupietz
et al, 2010). Some texts were removed in order to
balance the corpus. The balanced corpus contains
2848 documents and has been split into a develop-
ment and a training and test set. 570 documents
were used for the manual creation of features. The
remaining 2278 documents were used to train and
evaluate classifiers using 10-fold cross-validation
with the WEKA machine learning toolkit (Hall et
al., 2009) and various classifiers (cf. Table 1).
The challenge is that the newspaper articles
from the training and evaluation corpus come from
different newspapers and, of course, from differ-
ent authors. Commentaries in the yellow press
tend to have a very different style and vocabulary
than commentaries from broadsheet press. There-
fore, special attention needs to be paid to the in-
dependence of the classifier from different authors
and different newspapers. For this reason, we use
hand-crafted features tailored to this problem. In
return, this means omitting surface-form features
(i.e. words themselves).
The support vector machine used the SMO al-
gorithm (Platt and others, 1998) with a polynomial
kernel K(x, y) =< x, y > e with e = 2. All other
algorithms were used with default settings.

Table 1: Results of a 10-fold cross-validation for
various machine learning algorithms.
A qualitative evaluation shows that direct and
indirect speech is a problem for the classifier.
Opinions voiced via indirect speech should not
lead to a classification as ?Commentary?, but
should be ignored. Additionally, the number of
61
uses of direct and indirect speech by the author can
provide insight into the intention of the author. A
common way to voice one?s own opinion, without
having to do so explicitly, is to use indirect speech
that the author agrees with. Therefore, the number
of direct and indirect speech uses will be added
to the classifier. First experiments indicate that the
inclusion of direct and indirect speech increase the
performance of the classifier.
5 Related Work
Many approaches exist to assist social scientists in
dealing with large scale data. We discuss some
well-known ones and highlight differences to the
approach described above.
The Europe Media Monitor (EMM) (Stein-
berger et al, 2009) analyses large amounts of
newspaper articles and assists anyone interested in
news. It allows its users to search for specific top-
ics and automatically clusters articles from differ-
ent sources. This is a key concept of the EMM,
because it collects about 100, 000 articles in ap-
proximately 50 languages per day and it is impos-
sible to scan through these by hand. EMM users
are EU institutions, national institutions of the EU
member states, international organisations and the
public (Steinberger et al, 2009).
The topic clusters provide insight into ?hot?
topics by simply counting the amount of articles
per cluster or by measuring the amount of news on
a specific topic with regards to its normal amount
of news. Articles are also data-mined for geo-
graphical information, e.g. to update in which
geographical region the article was written and
where the topic is located. Social network infor-
mation is gathered and visualised as well.
Major differences between the EMM and our
approach are the user group and the domain of
the corpus. The complex concepts political sci-
entists are interested in are much more nuanced
than the concepts relevant for topic detection and
the construction of social networks. Additionally,
the EMM does not allow its users to look for their
own concepts and issues, while this interactivity
is a central contribution of our approach (cf. Sec-
tions 1, 2.1 and 3.2).
The CLARIN-D project also provides a web-
based platform to create NLP-chains. It is called
WebLicht (Hinrichs et al, 2010), but in its cur-
rent form, the tool is not immediately usable for
social scientists as the separation of metadata and
textual data and the encoding of the data is hard
for non-experts. Furthermore, WebLicht does not
yet support the combination of manual and au-
tomatic annotation needed for text exploration in
the social science. Our approach is based on the
webservices used by WebLicht. But in contrast to
WebLicht, we provide two additional components
that simplify the integration (exploration work-
bench) and the interpretation (complex concept
builder) of the research data. The former is in-
tended, in the medium term, to be made available
in the CLARIN framework.
6 Conclusion and Outlook
We developed and implemented a pipeline of var-
ious text processing tools which is designed to as-
sist political scientists in finding specific, complex
concepts within large amounts of text. Our case
studies showed that our approach can provide ben-
eficial assistance for the research of political sci-
entists as well as researcher from other social sci-
ences and the humanities. A future aspect will be
to find metrics to evaluate our pipeline. In recently
started annotation experiments on topic classifica-
tion Cohen?s kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) is
mediocre. It may very well be possible that the
complex concepts, like multiple collective identi-
ties, are intrinsically hard to detect, and the anno-
tations cannot be improved substantially.
The extension of the NLP pipeline will be an-
other major working area in the future. Examples
are sentiment analysis for German, adding world
knowledge about named entities (e.g. persons and
events), identification of relations between enti-
ties.
Finally, all these systems need to be evaluated
not only in terms of f-score, precision and recall,
but also in terms of usability for the political scien-
tists. This also includes a detailed investigation of
various political science concepts and if they can
be detected automatically or if natural language
processing can help the political scientists to de-
tect their concepts semi-automatically. The defini-
tion of such evaluation is an open research topic in
