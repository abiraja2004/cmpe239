Abstract
We argue that failing to capture the degree of
contribution of each semantic frame in a sen-
tence explains puzzling results in recent work
on the MEANT family of semantic MT eval-
uation metrics, which have disturbingly in-
dicated that dissociating semantic roles and
fillers from their predicates actually improves
correlation with human adequacy judgments
even though, intuitively, properly segregat-
ing event frames should more accurately re-
flect the preservation of meaning. Our anal-
ysis finds that both properly structured and
flattened representations fail to adequately ac-
count for the contribution of each seman-
tic frame to the overall sentence. We then
show that the correlation of HMEANT, the hu-
man variant of MEANT, can be greatly im-
proved by introducing a simple length-based
weighting scheme that approximates the de-
gree of contribution of each semantic frame
to the overall sentence. The new results
also show that, without flattening the struc-
ture of semantic frames, weighting the degree
of each frame?s contribution gives HMEANT
higher correlations than the previously best-
performing flattened model, as well as HTER.
1 Introduction
In this paper we provide a more concrete answer
to the question: what would be a better represen-
tation, structured or flat, of the roles in semantic
frames to be used in a semantic machine transla-
tion (MT) evaluation metric? We compare recent
studies on the MEANT family of semantic role la-
beling (SRL) based MT evaluation metrics (Lo and
Wu, 2010a,b, 2011a,b) by (1) contrasting their vari-
ations in semantic role representation and observing
disturbing comparative results indicating that segre-
gating the event frames in structured role representa-
tion actually damages correlation against human ad-
equacy judgments and (2) showing how SRL based
MT evaluation can be improved beyond the current
state-of-the-art compared to previous MEANT vari-
ants as well as HTER, through the introduction of
a simple weighting scheme that reflects the degree
of contribution of each semantic frame to the overall
sentence. The weighting scheme we propose uses
a simple length-based heuristic that reflects the as-
sumption that a semantic frame that covers more to-
kens contributes more to the overall sentence transla-
tion. We demonstrate empirically that when the de-
gree of each frame?s contribution to its sentence is
taken into account, the properly structured role rep-
resentation is more accurate and intuitive than the
flattened role representation for SRL MT evaluation
metrics.
For years, the task of measuring the performance
of MT systems has been dominated by lexical n-
gram based machine translation evaluation met-
rics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), NIST
(Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005), PER (Tillmann et al, 1997), CDER (Leusch
et al, 2006) and WER (Nie?en et al, 2000). These
metrics are excellent at ranking overall systems by
averaging their scores over entire documents. How-
ever, as MT systems improve, the shortcomings of
such metrics are becoming more apparent. Though
containing roughly the correct words, MT output at
the sentence remains often quite incomprehensible,
and fails to preserve the meaning of the input. This
results from the fact that n-gram based metrics are
not as reliable at ranking the adequacy of transla-
tions of individual sentences, and are particularly
10
poor at reflecting translation quality improvements
involving more meaningful word sense or semantic
frame decisions?which human judges have no trou-
ble distinguishing. Callison-Burch et al (2006) and
Koehn and Monz (2006), for example, study situ-
ations where BLEU strongly disagrees with human
judgment of translation quality.
Newer avenues of research seek substitutes for
n-gram based MT evaluation metrics that are bet-
ter at evaluating translation adequacy, particularly at
the sentence level. One line of research emphasizes
more the structural correctness of translation. Liu
and Gildea (2005) propose STM, a metric based on
syntactic structure, that addresses the failure of lex-
ical similarity based metrics to evaluate translation
grammaticality. However, the problem remains that
a grammatical translation can achieve a high syntax-
based score yet still make significant errors arising
from confusion of semantic roles. On the other hand,
despite the fact that non-automatic, manually evalu-
ated metrics, such as HTER (Snover et al, 2006), are
more adequacy oriented exhibit much higher correla-
tion with human adequacy judgment, their high labor
cost prohibits widespread use. There has also been
work on explicitly evaluating MT adequacy by ag-
gregating over a very large set of linguistic features
(Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2007, 2008) and textual en-
tailment (Pado et al, 2009).
2 SRL based MT evaluation metrics
A blueprint for more direct assessment of mean-
ing preservation across translation was outlined by
Lo and Wu (2010a), in which translation utility is
manually evaluated with respect to the accuracy of
semantic role labels. A good translation is one from
which human readers may successfully understand
at least the basic event structure??who did what
to whom, when, where and why? (Pradhan et al,
2004)?which represents the most essential meaning
of the source utterances. Adopting this principle,
the MEANT family of metrics compare the seman-
tic frames in reference translations against those that
can be reconstructed from machine translation out-
put.
Preliminary results reported in (Lo and Wu,
2010b) confirm that the blueprint model outper-
forms BLEU and similar n-gram oriented evalu-
ation metrics in correlation against human ade-
quacy judgments, but does not fare as well as
HTER. The more complete study of Lo and Wu
(2011a) introduces MEANT and its human variants
HMEANT, which implement an extended version of
blueprint methodology. Experimental results show
that HMEANT correlates against human adequacy
judgments as well as the more expensive HTER,
even though HMEANT can be evaluated using low-
cost untrained monolingual semantic role annotators
while still maintaining high inter-annotator agree-
ment (both are far superior to BLEU or other sur-
face oriented evaluation metrics). The study also
shows that replacing the human semantic role la-
belers with an automatic shallow semantic parser
yields an approximation that is still vastly superior
to BLEU while remaining about 80% as closely cor-
related with human adequacy judgments as HTER.
Along with additional improvements to the accu-
racy of the MEANT family of metrics, Lo and Wu
(2011b) study the impact of each individual seman-
tic role to themetric?s correlation against human ade-
quacy judgments, as well as the time cost for humans
to reconstruct the semantic frames and compare the
translation accuracy of the role fillers.
In general, the MEANT family of SRL MT eval-
uation metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011a,b) evaluate the
translation utility as follows. First, semantic role
labeling is performed (either manually or automat-
ically) on both the reference translation (REF) and
the machine translation output (MT) to obtain the
semantic frame structure. Then, the semantic pred-
icates, roles and fillers reconstructed from the MT
output are compared to those in the reference trans-
lations. The number of correctly and partially cor-
rectly annotated arguments of each type in each
frame of the MT output are collected in this step:
Ci,j ? # correct ARG i of PRED i in MT
Pi,j ? # partially correct ARG j of PRED i in MT
Mi,j ? total # ARG j of PRED i in MT
Ri,j ? total # ARG j of PRED i in REF
In the following three subsections, we describe
how the translation utility is calculated using these
counts in (a) the original blueprint model, (b) the
first version of HMEANT and MEANT using struc-
tured role representations, and (c) the more accu-

rate flattened-role implementation of HMEANT and
MEANT.
2.1 Structured core vs. adjunct role
representation
Figure 1 depicts the semantic role representation
in the blueprint model of SRL MT evaluation metric
proposed by Lo and Wu (2010a,b). Each sentence
consists of a number of frames, and each frame con-
sists of a predicate and two classes of arguments, ei-
ther core or adjunct. The frame precision/recall is
the weighted sum of the number of correctly trans-
lated roles (where arguments are grouped into the
core and adjunct classes) in a frame normalized by
the weighted sum of the total number of all roles in
that frame in the MT/REF respectively. The sen-
tence precision/recall is the sum of the frame preci-
sion/recall for all frames averaged by the total num-
ber of frames in the MT/REF respectively. The SRL
evaluation metric is then defined in terms of f-score
in order to balance the sentence precision and recall.
More precisely, assuming the above definitions of
Ci,j , Pi,j , Mi,j and Ri,j , the sentence precision and
recall are defined as follows.
precision =

where wpred is the weight for predicates, and wt
where t ? {core, adj} is the weight for core argu-
ments and adjunct arguments. These weights rep-
resent the degree of contribution of the predicate
and different classes of arguments (either core or ad-
junct) to the overall meaning of the semantic frame
they attach to. In addition,wpartial is a weight control-
ling the degree to which ?partially correct? transla-
tions are penalized. All the weights can be automat-
ically estimated by optimizing the correlation with
human adequacy judgments.
We conjecture that the reason for the low correla-
tion with human adequacy judgments of this model
as reported in Lo and Wu (2010b) is that the ab-
straction of arguments actually reduces the repre-
sentational power of the original predicate-argument
structure in SRL. Under this representation, all the
arguments in the same class, e.g. all adjunct argu-
ments, are weighted uniformly. The assumption that
all types of arguments in the same class have the
same degree of contribution to their frame is obvi-
ously wrong, and the empirical results confirm that
the assumption is too coarse.
2.2 Structured role representation
Figure 2 shows the structured role representation
used in the MEANT family of metrics as proposed
in Lo and Wu (2011a), which avoids aggregating ar-
guments into core and adjunct classes. The design
of the MEANT family of metrics addresses the in-
correct assumption in the blueprint model by assum-
ing each type of argument has a unique weight repre-
senting its degree of contribution to the overall sen-
tence translation. Thus, the number of dimensions of
12
the weight vector is increased to allow an indepen-
dent weight to be assigned to each type of argument.
Unlike the previous representation in the blueprint
model, there is no aggregation of arguments into
core and adjunct classes. Each sentence consists of a
number of frames, and each frame consists of a pred-
icate and a number of arguments of type j.
Under the new approach, the frame preci-
sion/recall is the weighted sum of the number of cor-
rectly translated roles in a frame normalized by the
weighted sum of the total number of all roles in that
frame in the MT/REF respectively. Similar to the
previous blueprint representation, the sentence pre-
cision/recall is the sum of the frame precision/recall
for all frames averaged by the total number of frames
in the MT/REF respectively. More precisely, fol-
lowing the previous definitions of Ci,j , Pi,j , Mi,j ,
Ri,j ,wpred andwpartial, the sentence precision and re-
call are redefined as follows.
precision =
?
i
wpred+

j
wj(Ci,j+wpartialPi,j)
wpred+

#frames in MT
recall =
?
i
wpred+
?
j
wj(Ci,j+wpartialPi,j)
wpred+
?
j
wjRi,j
# frames in REF
where wj is the weight for the arguments of type j.
Theseweights represent the degree of contribution of
different types of arguments to the overall meaning
of their semantic frame.
2.3 Flat role representation
Figure 3 depicts the flat role representation used in
themore accurate variants ofMEANT as proposed in
Lo andWu (2011b). This representation ismotivated
by the studies of the impact of individual seman-
tic role. The highly significant difference between
this flat representation and both of the previous two
structured role representations is that the semantic
frames in the sentence are no longer segregated.
The flat role representation desegregates the frame
structure, resulting in a flat, single level structure.
Therefore, there is no frame precision/recall. The
sentence precision/recall is the weighted sum of the
number of correctly translated roles in all frames nor-
malized by the weighted sum of the total number of
roles in all frames in theMT/REF respectively. More
precisely, again assuming the previous definitions of
Ci,j , Pi,j , Mi,j , Ri,j and wpartial, the sentence preci-
sion and recall are redefined as follows.
Cpred ? total # correctly translated predicates
Mpred ? total # predicates in MT
Rpred ? total # predicates in REF
precision =
wpredCpred +
?
j wj
(
?
i(Ci,j + wpartialPi,j)
)
wpredMpred +
?
j wj
(
?
i Mi,j
)
recall =
wpredCpred +
?
j wj
(
?
i(Ci,j + wpartialPi,j)
)
wpredRpred +
?
j wj
(
?
i Ri,j
)
Note that there is a small modification of the defini-
tion of wpred and wj . Instead of the degree of contri-
bution to the overall meaning of the semantic frame
that the roles attached to, wpredand wj now represent
the degree of contribution of the predicate and the ar-
guments of type j to the overall meaning of the entire
sentence.
It is worth noting that the semantic role features in
the ULC metric proposed by Gime?nez and Ma`rquez
(2008) also employ a flat feature-based represen-
tation of semantic roles. However, the definition
of those semantic role features adopts a different
methodology for determining the role fillers? transla-
tion accuracy, which prevents a controlled consistent
environment for the comparative experiments that
the present work focuses on.
3 Experimental setup
The evaluation data for our experiments consists
of 40 sentences randomly drawn from the DARPA
GALE program Phase 2.5 newswire evaluation cor-
pus containing Chinese input sentence, English ref-
erence translations, and themachine translation from
three different state-of-the-art GALE systems. The
Chinese and the English reference translation have
both been annotated with gold standard PropBank
(Palmer et al, 2005) semantic role labels. The
weightswpred, wcore, wadj, wj and wpartial can be esti-
mated by optimizing correlation against human ade-
quacy judgments, using any of themany standard op-
timization search techniques. In the work of Lo and
13
Figure 3: The flat role representation for the MEANT family of metrics as proposed in Lo and Wu (2011b) .
Wu (2011b), the correlations of all individual roles
with the human adequacy judgments were found to
be non-negative, therefore we found grid search to
be quite adequate for estimating the weights. We use
linear weighting because we would like to keep the
metric?s interpretation simple and intuitive.
Following the benchmark assessment in NIST
MetricsMaTr 2010 (Callison-Burch et al, 2010), we
assess the performance of the semantic MT evalua-
tion metric at the sentence level using the summed-
diagonal-of-confusion-matrix score. The human ad-
equacy judgments were obtained by showing all
three MT outputs together with the Chinese source
input to a human reader. The human reader was in-
structed to order the sentences from the three MT
systems according to the accuracy of meaning in
the translations. For the MT output, we ranked the
sentences from the three MT systems according to
their evaluation metric scores. By comparing the
two sets of rankings, a confusion matrix is formed.
The summed diagonal of confusion matrix is the per-
centage of the total count when a particular rank by
the metric?s score exactly matches the human judg-
ments. The range of possible values of summed di-
agonal of confusion matrix is [0,1], where 1 means
all the systems? ranks determined by the metric are
identical with that of the human judgments and 0
means all the systems? ranks determined by the met-
ric are different from that of the human judgment.
Since the summed diagonal of confusion matrix
scores only assess the absolute ranking accuracy,
we also report the Kendall?s ? rank correlation co-
efficients, which measure the correlation of the pro-
posed metric against human judgments with respect
to their relative ranking of translation adequacy. A
higher the value for ? indicates the more similar the
ranking by the evaluation metric to the human judg-
ment. The range of possible values of correlation

4 Round 1: Flat beats structured
Our first round of comparative results quantita-
tively assess whether a structured role representation
(that properly preserves the semantic frame struc-
ture, which is typically hierarchically nested in com-
positional fashion) outperforms the simpler (but less
intuitive, and certainly less linguistically satisfying)
flat role representation.
As shown in table 1, disturbingly, HMEANT us-
ing flat role representations yields higher correla-
tions against human adequacy judgments than us-
ing structured role representations, regardless of
whether role types are aggregated into core and
adjunct classes. The results are consistent for
both Kendall?s tau correlation coefficient and Met-
ricsMaTr?s summed diagonal of confusion matrix.
HMEANT using a flat role representation achieved
a Kendall?s tau correlation coefficient and summed
diagonal of confusion matrix score of 0.4685 and
0.5583 respectively, which is superior to both

tion, incorporating a weighting scheme reflecting the de-
gree of contribution of each semantic frame to the overall
sentence.
HMEANT using a structured role representation
(0.4324 and 0.5083 respectively) and the blueprint
model (0.3784 and 0.4667 respectively).
Error analysis, in light of these surprising results,
strongly suggests that the problem lies in the design
which uniformly averages the frame precision/recall
over all frames in a sentence when computing the
sentence precision/recall. This essentially assumes
that each frame in a sentence contributes equally
to the overall meaning in the sentence translation.
Such an assumption is trivially wrong and could well
hugely degrade the advantages of using a structured
role representation for semanticMT evaluation. This
suggests that the structured role representation could
be improved by also capturing the degree of contri-
bution of each frame to the overall sentence transla-
tion.
5 Capturing the importance of each frame
To address the problem in the previousmodels, we
introduce a weighting scheme to reflect the degree
of contribution of each semantic frame to the overall
sentence. However, unlike the contribution of each
role to a frame, the contribution of each frame to
the overall sentence cannot be estimated across sen-
tences. This is because unlike semantic roles, which
can be identified by their types, frames do not neces-
sarily have easily defined types, and their construc-
tion is also different from sentence to sentence so that
the positions of their predicates in the sentence are
the only way to identify the frames. However, the
degree of contribution of each frame does not depend
on the position of the predicate in the sentence. For
example, the two sentences I met Tom when I was go-
ing home andWhen I was walking home, I saw Tom have
similar meanings. The verbs met and saw are the
predicates of the key event frames which contribute
more to the overall sentences, whereas going and
walking are the predicates of the minor nested event
frames (in locative manner roles of the key event
frames) and contribute less to the overall sentences.
However, the two sentences are realized with differ-
ent surface constructions, and the two key frames are
in different positions. Therefore, the weights learned
from one sentence cannot directly be applied to the
other sentence.
Instead of estimating the weight of each frame us-
ing optimization techniques, wemake an assumption
that a semantic frame filled with more word tokens
expresses more concepts and thus contributes more
to the overall sentence. Following this assumption,
we determine the weights of each semantic frame by
its span coverage in the sentence. In other words,
the weight of each frame is the percentage of word
tokens it covers in the sentence.
Figure 4 depicts the structured role representa-
tion with the proposed new frame weighting scheme.
The significant difference between this representa-
tion and the structured role representation in the
MEANT variants proposed in Lo and Wu (2011a)
is that each frame is now assigned an independent
weight, which is its span coverage in the MT/REF
when obtaining the frame precision/recall respec-
tively.
As in Lo and Wu (2011a), each sentence consists
of a number of frames, and each frame consists of
a predicate and a number of arguments of type j.
Each type of argument is assigned an independent
weight to represent its degree of contribution to the
overall meaning of the semantic frame they attached
to. The frame precision/recall is the weighted sum
of the number of correctly translated roles in a frame
normalized by the weighted sum of the number of all
roles in that frame in the MT/REF. The sentence pre-
cision/recall is the weighted sum of the frame preci-
sion/recall for all frames normalized by the weighted
sum of the total number of frames in MT/REF re-
spectively. More precisely, again assuming the ear-
15
lier definitions of Ci,j , Pi,j , Mi,j , Ri,j , wpred and
wpartial in section 2, the sentence precision and recall
are redefined as follows.
mi ?
# tokens filled in frame i of MT

where mi and ri are the weights for frame i, in the
MT/REF respectively. These weights estimate the
degree of contribution of each frame to the overall
meaning of the sentence.
6 Round 2: Structured beats flat
We now assess the performance of the new pro-
posed structured role representation, by comparing
it with the previous models under the same experi-
mental setup as in section 4. We have also run con-
trastive experiments against BLEU and HTER un-
der the same experimental conditions. In addition,
to investigate the consistency of results for the au-
tomated variants of MEANT, we also include com-
parative experiments where shallow semantic pars-
ing (ASSERT) replaces human semantic role label-
ers for each model of role representation.
Figure 5 shows an example where HMEANTwith
the frame weighting scheme outperforms HMEANT
using other role representations in correlation against
human adequacy judgments. IN is the Chinese
source input. REF is the corresponding refer-
ence translation. MT1, MT2 and MT3 are the
three corresponding MT output. The human ade-
quacy judgments for this set of translation are that
MT1>MT3>MT2. HMEANT with the proposed
frame weighting predicts the same ranking order
as the human adequacy judgment, while HMEANT
with the flat role representation and HMEANT
with the structured role representation without frame
weighting both predict MT3>MT1>MT2. There
are four semantic frames in IN while there are only
three semantic frames in the REF. This is because
the predicate ?? in IN is translated in REF as had
which is not a predicate. However, for the same
frame, both MT1 and MT2 translated ARG1???
? into the predicate affect, while MT3 did not trans-
late the predicate ?? and translated the ARG1 ?
??? into the noun phrase adverse impact. There-
fore, using the flat role representation or the previ-
ous structured role representation which assume all
frames have an identical degree of contribution to the
overall sentence translation, MT1?s and MT2?s sen-
tence precision is greatly penalized for having one
more extra frame than the reference. In contrast, ap-
plying the frame weighting scheme, the degree of
contribution of each frame is adjusted by its token
coverage. Therefore, the negative effect of the less
important extra frames is minimized, allowing the
positive effect of correctly translating more roles in
more important frames to be more appropriately re-
flected.
Table 2 shows that HMEANT with the proposed
new frameweighting scheme correlatesmore closely
with human adequacy judgments than HMEANT
using the previous alternative role representations.
The results from Kendall?s tau correlation coeffi-
cient and MetricsMaTr?s summed diagonal of con-
fusion matrix analysis are consistent. HMEANT
using the frame-weighted structured role represen-
tation achieved a Kendall?s tau correlation coef-
ficient and summed diagonal of confusion matrix
score of 0.2865 and 0.575 respectively, bettering
both HMEANT using the flat role representation
(0.4685 and 0.5583) and HMEANT using the pre-
vious un-frame-weighted structured role representa-
tion (0.4324 and 0.5083).
HMEANT using the improved structured role rep-
resentation also outperforms other commonly used
MT evaluation metrics. It correlates with human ad-
equacy judgments more closely than HTER (0.4324
and 0.425 in Kendall?s tau correlation coefficient and
summed diagonal of confusionmatrix, respectively).
It also correlates with human adequacy judgments
significantly more closely than BLEU (0.1982 and
0.425).
Turning to the variants that replace human SRL
with automated SRL, table 2 shows that MEANT

un-frame-weighted structured role representation fails to rank MT1 and MT3 in an order that matches with human
adequacy judgments. See section 6 for details.

using the new frame-weighted structured role repre-
sentation yields an approximation that is about 81%
as closely correlated with human adequacy judgment
as HTER, and is better than all previous MEANT
variants using alternative role representations. All
results consistently confirm that using a structured
role representation with the new frame weighting
scheme, which captures the event structure and an
approximate degree of contribution of each frame to
the overall sentence, outperforms using a flat role
representation for SRL based MT evaluation met-
rics.
7 Conclusion
We have shown how the MEANT family of SRL
based MT evaluation metrics is significantly im-
proved beyond the state-of-the-art for both HTER
and previous variants of MEANT, through the in-
troduction of a simple but well-motivated weight-
ing scheme to reflect the degree of contribution of
each semantic frame to the overall sentence trans-
lation. Following the assumption that a semantic
frame filled with more word tokens tends to express
more concepts, the new model weight each frame
by its span coverage. Consistent experimental re-
sults have been demonstrated under conditions uti-
lizing both human and automatic SRL. Under the
new frame weighted representation, properly nested
structured semantic frame representations regain an
empirically preferred position over the less intuitive
and linguistically unsatisfying flat role representa-
tions.
One future direction of this work will be to com-
pare MEANT against the feature based and string
based representations of semantic relations in ULC.
Such a comparison could yield a more complete
credit/blame perspective on the representationmodel
when operating under the condition of using auto-
matic SRL.
Another interesting extension of this work would
be to investigate the discriminative power of the
MEANT family of metrics to distinguish distances
in translation adequacy. In this paper we confirmed
that the MEANT family of metrics are stable in cor-
relation with human ranking judgments of transla-
tion adequacy. Further studies could focus on the
correlation of the MEANT family of metrics against
human scoring. We also plan to experiment on meta-
evaluating MEANT on a larger scale in other genres
and for other language pairs.
