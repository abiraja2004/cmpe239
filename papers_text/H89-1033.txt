Natural Language Understanding 
Our task, broadly stated, is the development of systems for the understanding of narrative 
messages in limited domains. Improving the current state-of-the-art forsuch systems will require 
a better understanding of how to capture and utilize domain information, and how to effectively 
combine the various ources of information (syntactic, semantic, and discourse) to create arobust 
language analyzer. 
For our study of the structure and use of domain information, we have focussed on 
CASREP messages describing the failure, diagnosis, and attempted repair of shipboard equip- 
ment. Because much of the information -- particularly the relation between the individual events 
in the narrative -- is implicit, a thorough understanding of these messages requires ubstantial 
knowledge of the equipment involved. We have captured this knowledge for one piece of equip- 
ment -- the starting air system for gas turbine propulsion systems -- through amodel which incor- 
porates tructural and functional information about he equipment. We have then developed a 
natural language analyzer which uses the simulation capabilities of this model to determine the 
implicit causal relations between the events in a message. For example, if a message states 
"Compressor won't start. Shaft was sheared." the language analyzer could use the model to ver- 
ify that the shearing was a plausible cause of the failure of the compressor. 
For our study of the effective integration of syntactic, semantic, and discourse information, 
we are developing an analyzer for ship sighting messages (RAINFORMs). These messages use 
very compressed natural language, where many of the participants in an event are implicit; the 
challange for the analyzer is to recover this information. To parse these messages, we have 
extended a general English grammar to allow the omission of case and complement markers 
("of", "at", "to", "as"), copulas ("be"), and a few other constituents. Our parser does a best-first 
search to obtain the analysis which is consistent with the semantic constraints of the domain and 
has the fewest omissions. To recover missing operands, we are experimenting with a measure of 
message coherence based on cause/effect and enabling condition/action relations between events 
in the message. When semantic case frame constraints alone would allow several possible fillers 
for a missing operand, our system prefers the analysis yielding the highest message coherence. 
Considerable additional experimentation s required to evaluate the role of this coherence 
measure, and to balance the syntactic, semantic, and discourse coherence constraints. We expect 
that the data for MUCK-II will provide some initial evaluation of these techniques.
