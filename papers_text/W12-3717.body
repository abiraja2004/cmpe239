Abstract
According to previous work on pedophile psy-
chology and cyberpedophilia, sentiments and
emotions in texts could be a good clue to de-
tect online sexual predation. In this paper, we
have suggested a list of high-level features, in-
cluding sentiment and emotion based ones, for
detection of online sexual predation. In partic-
ular, since pedophiles are known to be emo-
tionally unstable, we were interested in inves-
tigating if emotion-based features could help
in their detection. We have used a corpus of
predators? chats with pseudo-victims down-
loaded from www.perverted-justice.com and
two negative datasets of different nature: cy-
bersex logs available online and the NPS chat
corpus. Naive Bayes classification based on
the proposed features achieves accuracies of
up to 94% while baseline systems of word and
character n-grams can only reach up to 72%.
1 Introduction
Child sexual abuse and pedophilia are both problems
of great social concern. On the one hand, law en-
forcement is working on prosecuting and preventing
child sexual abuse. On the other hand, psycholo-
gists and mental specialists are investigating the phe-
nomenon of pedophilia. Even though the pedophilia
has been studied from different research points, it re-
mains to be a very important problem which requires
further research, especially from the automatic de-
tection point of view.
Previous studies report that in the majority of
cases of sexual assaults the victims are under-
aged (Snyder, 2000). On the Internet, attempts
to solicit children have become common as well.
Mitchell (2001) found out that 19% of children have
been sexually approached online. However, manual
monitoring of each conversation is impossible, due
to the massive amount of data and privacy issues. A
good alternative is the development of reliable tools
for detecting pedophilia in online social media is of
great importance.
In this paper, we address the problem of detecting
pedophiles with natural language processing (NLP)
techniques. This problem becomes even more chal-
lenging because of the chat data specificity. Chat
conversations are very different not only from the
written text but also from other types of social media
interactions, such as blogs and forums, since chat-
ting in the Internet usually involves very fast typing.
The data usually contains a large amount of mis-
takes, misspellings, specific slang, character flood-
ing etc. Therefore, accurate processing of this data
with automated syntactic analyzers is rather chal-
lenging.
Previous research on pedophilia reports that the
expression of certain emotions in text could be help-
ful to detect pedophiles in social media (Egan et al.,
2011). Following these insights we suggest a list
of features, including sentiments as well as other
content-based features. We investigate the impact
of these features on the problem of automatic detec-
tion of online sexual predation. Our experimental
results show that classification based on such fea-
tures discriminates pedophiles from non-pedophiles
with high accuracy.
The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: Section 2 overviews related work on the topic,
110
Section 3 outlines the profile of a pedophile based on
the previous research. Our approach to the problem
of detecting pedophiles in social media on the ba-
sis of high-level features is presented in Section 4.
Experimental data is described in Section 5. We
show the results of the conducted experiments in
Section 6; they are followed by discussion and plans
for future research in Section 7. We finally draw
some conclusions in Section 8.
2 Related Research
The problem of automatic detection of pedophiles
in social media has been rarely addressed so far. In
part, this is due to the difficulties involved in hav-
ing access to useful data. There is an American
foundation called Perverted Justice (PJ). It investi-
gates cases of online sexual predation: adult volun-
teers enter chat rooms as juveniles (usually 12-15
year old) and if they are sexually solicited by adults,
they work with the police to prosecute the offenders.
Some chat conversations with online sexual preda-
tors are available at www.perverted-justice.com and
they have been the subject of analysis of recent re-
search on this topic.
Pendar (2007) experimented with PJ data. He sep-
arated the lines written by pedophiles from those
written by pseudo-victims and used a kNN classi-
fier based on word n-grams to distinguish between
them.
Another related research has been carried out by
McGhee et al. (2011). The chat lines from PJ were
manually classified into the following categories:
1. Exchange of personal information
2. Grooming
3. Approach
4. None of the listed above classes
Their experiments have shown that kNN classifi-
cation achieves up to 83% accuracy and outperforms
a rule-based approach.
As it was already mentioned, pedophiles often
create false profiles and pretend to be younger or
of another gender. Moreover, they try to copy
children?s behavior. Automatically detecting age
and gender in chat conversations could then be the
first step in detecting online predators. Peersman
et al. (2011) have analyzed chats from the Bel-
gium Netlog social network. Discrimination be-
tween those who are older than 16 from those who
are younger based on a Support Vector Machine
classification yields 71.3% accuracy. The accuracy
is even higher when the age gap is increased (e.g.
the accuracy of classifying those who are less than
16 from those who are older than 25 is 88.2%). They
have also investigated the issues of the minimum
amount of training data needed. Their experiments
have shown that with 50% of the original dataset the
accuracy remains almost the same, and with only
10% it is still much better than the random baseline
performance.
NLP techniques were as well applied to capture
child sexual abuse data in P2P networks (Panchenko
et al., 2012). The proposed text classification system
is able to predict with high accuracy if a file contains
child pornography by analyzing its name and textual
description.
Our work neither aims at classification of chat
lines into categories as it was done by McGhee et
al. (2011) nor at discriminating between victim and
predator as it was done by Pendar (2007), but at dis-
tinguishing between pedophile?s and not pedophile?s
chats, in particular, by utilizing clues provided by
psychology and sentiment analysis.
3 Profiling the Pedophile
Pedophilia is a ?disorder of adult personality and be-
havior? which is characterized by sexual interest in
prepubescent children (International statistical clas-
sification of diseases and related health problems,
1988). Even though solicitation of children is not a
medical diagnosis, Abel and Harlow (2001) reported
that 88% of child sexual abuse cases are commit-
ted by pedophiles. Therefore, we believe that under-
standing behavior of pedophiles could help to detect
and prevent online sexual predation. Even though an
online sexual offender is not always a pedophile, in
this paper we use these terms as synonyms.
Previous research reports that about 94% of sex-
ual offenders are males. With respect to female sex-
ual molesters, it is reported, that they tend to be
young and, in these cases, men are often involved
as well (Vandiver and Kercher, 2004). Sexual as-
111
sault offenders are more often adults (77%), though
in 23% of cases children are solicited by other juve-
niles.
Analysis of pedophiles? personality characterizes
them with feelings of inferiority, isolation, lone-
liness, low self-esteem and emotional immaturity.
Moreover, 60%-80% of them suffer from other psy-
chiatric illnesses (Hall and Hall, 2007). In general,
pedophiles are less emotionally stable than mentally
healthy people.
3.1 Profile of the Online Sexual Predator
Hall and Hall (2007) noticed that five main types
of computer-based sexual offenders can be distin-
guished: (1) the stalkers, who approach children in
chat rooms in order to get physical access to them;
(2) the cruisers, who are interested in online sexual
molestation and not willing to meet children offline;
(3) the masturbators, who watch child pornography;
(4) the networkers or swappers, who trade informa-
tion, pornography, and children; and (5) a combi-
nation of the four types. In this study we are in-
terested in detecting stalkers (type (1)) and cruisers
(type (2)).
The language sexual offenders use was analyzed
by Egan et al. (2011). The authors considered the
chats available from PJ. The analysis of the chats
revealed several characteristics of predators? lan-
guage:
? Implicit/explicit content. On the one hand,
predators shift gradually to the sexual conversa-
tion, starting with more ordinary compliments:
Predator: hey you are really cute
Predator: u are pretty
Predator: hi sexy
On the other hand, the conversa-
tion then becomes overtly related to
sex. They do not hide their intentions:
Predator: can we have sex?
Predator: you ok with sex with me and
drinking?
? Fixated discourse. Predators are not willing to
step aside from the sexual conversation. For
example, in this conversation the predator al-
most ignores the question of pseudo-victim and
comes back to the sex-related conversation:
Predator: licking dont hurt
Predator: its like u lick ice cream
Pseudo-victim: do u care that im 13 in
march and not yet? i lied a little bit b4
Predator: its all cool
Predator: i can lick hard
? Offenders often understand that what they are
doing is not moral:
Predator: i would help but its not moral
? They transfer responsibility to the victim:
Pseudo-victim: what ya wanta do when u
come over
Predator: whatever?movies, games, drink,
play around?it?s up to you?what would you
like to do?
Pseudo-victim: that all sounds good
Pseudo-victim: lol
Predator: maybe get some sexy pics of you
:-P
Predator: would you let me take pictures of
you? of you naked? of me and you playing?
:-D
? Predators often behave as children, copying
their linguistic style. Colloquialisms appear of-
ten in their messages:
Predator: howwwww dy
...
Predator: i know PITY MEEEE
? They try to minimize the risk of being prose-
cuted: they ask to delete chat logs and warn
victims not to tell anyone about the talk:
112
Predator: don?t tell anyone we have been
talking
Pseudo-victim: k
Pseudo-victim: lol who would i tell? no
one?s here.
Predator: well I want it to be our secret
? Though they finally stop being cautious and in-
sist on meeting offline:
Predator: well let me come see you
Pseudo-victim: why u want 2 come
over so bad?
Predator: i wanna see you
In general Egan et al. (Egan et al., 2011) have
found online solicitation to be more direct, while in
real life children seduction is more deceitful.
4 Our Approach
We address the problem of automatic detection of
online sexual predation. While previous studies
were focused on classifying chat lines into differ-
ent categories (McGheeet al., 2011) or distinguish-
ing between offender and victim (Pendar, 2007), in
this work we address the problem of detecting sex-
ual predators.
We formulate the problem of detecting pedophiles
in social media as the task of binary text categoriza-
tion: given a text (a set of chat lines), the aim is to
predict whether it is a case of cyberpedophilia or not.
4.1 Features
On the basis of previous analysis of pedophiles? per-
sonality (described in previous section), we consider
as features those emotional markers that could un-
veil a certain degree of emotional instability, such
as feelings of inferiority, isolation, loneliness, low
self-esteem and emotional immaturity.
On the one hand, pedophiles try to be nice with a
victim and make compliments, at least in the begin-
ning of a conversation. Therefore, the use of posi-
tive words is expected. On the other hand, as it was
described earlier, pedophiles tend to be emotionally
unstable and prone to lose temper, hence they might
start using words expressing anger and negative lex-
icon. Other emotions can be as well a clue to detect
pedophiles. For example, offenders often demon-
strate fear, especially with respect to being prose-
cuted, and they often lose temper and express anger:
Pseudo-victim: u sad didnt car if im 13. now u car.
Predator: well, I am just scared about being in
trouble or going to jail
Pseudo-victim: u sad run away now u say no. i
gues i dont no what u doin
Predator: I got scared
Predator: we would get caugth sometime
In this example pseudo-victim is not answering:
Predator: hello
Predator: r u there
Predator:
Predator: thnx a lot
Predator: thanx a lot
Predator:
Predator: u just wast my time
Predator: drive down there
Predator: can u not im any more
Here the offender is angry because the pseudo-
victim did not call him:
Predator: u didnt call
Predator: i m angry with u
Therefore, we have decided to use markers of
basic emotions as features. At the SemEval 2007
task on ?Affective Text? (Strapparava and Mihal-
cea, 2007) the problem of fine-grained emotion an-
notation was defined: given a set of news titles,
the system is to label each title with the appropri-
ate emotion out of the following list: ANGER, DIS-
GUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, SURPRISE. In this
research work we only use the percentages of the
markers of each emotion.
We have also borrowed several features from
McGhee et al. (2011):
? Percentage of approach words. Approach
words include verbs such as come and meet and
such nouns as car and hotel.
? Percentage of relationship words. These words
refer to dating (e.g. boyfriend, date).
113
? Percentage of family words. These words are
the names of family members (e.g. mum, dad,
brother).
? Percentage of communicative desensitization
words. These are explicit sexual terms offend-
ers use in order to desensitize the victim (e.g.
penis, sex).
? Percentage of words expressing sharing infor-
mation. This implies sharing basic information,
such as age, gender and location, and sending
photos. The words include asl, pic.
Since pedophiles are known to be emotionally un-
stable and suffer from psychological problems, we
consider features reported to be helpful to detect
neuroticism level by Argamon et al. (2009). In par-
ticular, the features include percentages of personal
and reflexive pronouns and modal obligation verbs
(have to, has to, had to, must, should, mustn?t, and
shouldn?t).
We consider the use of imperative sentences and
emoticons to capture the predators tendencies to
be dominant and copy childrens? behaviour respec-
tively.
The study of Egan et al. (Egan et al., 2011) has
revealed several recurrent themes that appear in PJ
chats. Among them, fixated discourse: the unwill-
ingness of the predator to change the topic. In (Bog-
danova et al., 2012) we present experiments on mod-
eling the fixated discourse. We have constructed lex-
ical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991) starting with
the anchor word ?sex? in the first WordNet mean-
ing: ?sexual activity, sexual practice, sex, sex activ-
ity (activities associated with sexual intercourse)?.
We have finally used as a feature the length of the
lexical chain constructed with the Resnik similarity
measure (Resnik, 1995) with the threshold = 0.7.
The full list of features is presented in Table 1.
5 Datasets
Pendar (2007) has summarized the possible types of
chat interactions with sexually explicit content:
1. Predator/Other
(a) Predator/Victim (victim is underaged)
(b) Predator/Volunteer posing as a children
(c) Predator/Law enforcement officer posing
as a child
2. Adult/Adult (consensual relationship)
The most interesting from our research point of
view is data of the type 1a, but obtaining such
data is not easy. However, the data of the type 1b
is freely available at the web site www.perverted-
justice.com. For our study, we have extracted chat
logs from the perverted-justice website. Since the
victim is not real, we considered only the chat lines
written by predators.
Since our goal is to distinguish sex related chat
conversations where one of the parties involved is a
pedophile, the ideal negative dataset would be chat
conversations of type 2 (consensual relations among
adults) and the PJ data will not meet this condition
for the negative instances. We need additional chat
logs to build the negative dataset. We used two neg-
ative datasets in our experiments: cybersex chat logs
and the NPS chat corpus.
We downloaded the cybersex chat logs available
at www.oocities.org/urgrl21f/. The archive contains
34 one-on-one cybersex logs. We have separated
lines of different authors, thereby obtaining 68 files.
We have also used the subset the of NPS chat cor-
pus (Forsythand and Martell, 2007), though it is not
of type 2. We have extracted chat lines only for those
adult authors who had more than 30 lines written.
Finally the dataset consisted of 65 authors. From
each dataset we have left 20 files for testing.
6 Experiments
To distinguish between predators and not predators
we used a Naive Bayes classifier, already success-
fully utilized for analyzing chats by previous re-
search (Lin, 2007). To extract positive and nega-
tive words, we used SentiWordNet (Baccianella et
al., 2010). The features borrowed from McGhee et
al. (2011), were detected with the list of words au-
thors made available for us. Imperative sentences
were detected as affirmative sentences starting with
verbs. Emoticons were captured with simple regular
expressions.
Our dataset is imbalanced, the majority of the chat
logs are from PJ. To make the experimental data
more balanced, we have created 5 subsets of PJ cor-

pus, each of which contained chat lines from 60 ran-
domly selected predators.
For the cybersex logs, half of the chat sessions
belong to the same author. We used this author for
training, and the rest for testing, in order to prevent
the classification algorithm from learning to distin-
guish this author from pedophiles.
For comparison purposes, we experimented with
several baseline systems using low-level features
based on n-grams at the word and character level,
which were reported as useful features by related re-
search (Peersman et al., 2011). We trained naive
Bayes classifiers using word level unigrams, bi-
grams and trigrams. We also trained naive Bayes
classifiers using character level bigrams and tri-
grams.
The classification results are presented in Tables 2
and 3. The high-level features outperform all the
low-level ones in both the cybersex logs and the NPS
chat datasets and achieve 94% and 90% accuracy on
these datasets respectively.
Cybersex chat logs are data of type 2 (see previ-
ous section), they contain sexual content and, there-
fore, share same of the same vocabulary with the
perverted-justice data, whilst the NPS data gener-
ally is not sex-related. Therefore, we expected low-
level features to provide better results on the NPS
data. The experiments have shown that, except for
the character bigrams, all low-level features consid-
ered indeed work worse in case of cybersex logs
(see the average rows in both tables). The aver-
age accuracy in this case varies between 48% and
58%. Surprisingly, low-level features do not work
as good as we expected in case of the NPS chat
dataset: bag of words provides only 61% accuracy.
Among other low-level features, character trigrams
provide the highest accuracy of 72%, which is still
much lower than the one of the high-level features
(90%). The high-level features yield a lower accu-
racy (90% accuracy) on the PJ-NPS dataset than in
the case of PJ-cybersex logs (94% accuracy). This is
probably due to the data diversity: cybersex chat is
a very particular type of a conversation, though NPS
chat corpora can contain any type of conversations
up to sexual predation.

7 Discussion and Future Work
We have conducted experiments on detecting pe-
dophiles in social media with a binary classification
algorithm. In the experiments we used two negative
datasets of different nature: the first one is more ap-
propriate, it contains one-on-one cybersex conversa-
tions, while the second dataset is extracted from the
NPS chat corpus and contains logs from chat rooms,
and, therefore, is less appropriate since the conver-
sations are not even one on one.
It is reasonable to expect that in the case of the
negative data consisting of cybersex logs, distin-
guishing cyberpedophiles is a harder task, than in the
case of the NPS data. The results obtained with the
baseline systems support this assumption: we obtain
higher accuracy for the NPS chats in all but character
bi-grams. The interesting insight from these results
is that our proposed higher-level features are able to
boost accuracy to 94% on the seemingly more chal-
lenging task.
Our error analysis showed that the NPS logs mis-
classified with the high-level features are also mis-
classified by the baseline systems. These instances
either share the same lexicon or are about the same
topics. Therefore they are more similar to cyberpe-
dophiles training data than the training data of the
NPS corpus, which is very diverse. These examples
are taken from misclassified NPS chat logs:
User: love me like a bomb baby come on get it on
...
User: ryaon so sexy
User: you are so anal
User: obviously i didn?t get it
User: just loosen up babe
...
User: i want to make love to him
User: right field wrong park lol j/k
User: not me i put them in the jail lol
User: or at least tell the cops where to go to get the
bad guys lol
In the future we plan to further investigate the
misclassified data. The feature extraction we have
implemented does not use any word sense disam-
biguation. This can as well cause mistakes since
the markers are not just lemmas but words in par-
ticular senses, since for example the lemma ?fit?
can be either a positive marker (?a fit candidate?)
or negative (?a fit of epilepsy?), depending on the
116
context. Therefore we plan to employ word sense
disambiguation techniques during the feature extrac-
tion phase.
So far we have only seen that the list of fea-
tures we have suggested provides good results.
They outperform all thelow-level features consid-
ered. Among those low-level features, character tri-
grams provide the best results on the NPS data (72%
accuracy), though on the cybersex logs they achieve
only 54%. We plan to merge low-level and high-
level features in order to see if this could improve
the results.
In the future we plan also to explore the impact of
each high-level feature. To better understand which
ones carry more discriminative power and if we can
reduce the number of features. All these experi-
ments will be done employing naive Bayes as well
as Support Vector Machines as classifiers.
8 Conclusions
This paper presents some results of an ongoing re-
search project on the detection of online sexual pre-
dation, a problem the research community is inter-
ested in, as the PAN task on Sexual Predator Identi-
fication1 suggests.
Following the clues given by psychological re-
search, we have suggested a list of high-level fea-
tures that should take into account the level of emo-
tional instability of pedophiles, as well as their feel-
ings of inferiority, isolation, loneliness, low self-
esteem etc. We have considered as well such low-
level features as character bigrams and trigrams and
word unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. The Naive
Bayes classification based on high-level features
achieves 90% and 94% accuracy when using NPS
chat corpus and the cybersex chat logs as a nega-
tive dataset respectively, whereas low-level features
achieve only 42%-72% and 48%-58% accuracy on
the same data.
