Abstract 
Sentiment analysis means to extract opinion 
of users from review documents. Sentiment 
classification using Machine Learning (ML) 
methods faces the problem of high dimen-
sionality of feature vector. Therefore, a fea-
ture selection method is required to eliminate 
the irrelevant and noisy features from the 
feature vector for efficient working of ML 
algorithms. Rough Set Theory based feature 
selection method finds the optimal feature 
subset by eliminating the redundant features. 
In this paper, Rough Set Theory (RST) based 
feature selection method is applied for sen-
timent classification. A Hybrid feature selec-
tion method based on RST and Information 
Gain (IG) is proposed for sentiment classifi-
cation. Proposed methods are evaluated on 
four standard datasets viz. Movie review, 
product (book, DVD and electronics) review 
dataset. Experimental results show that Hy-
brid feature selection method outperforms 
than other feature selection methods for sen-
timent classification. 
1 Introduction 
Sentiment analysis is to extract the users? opinion 
by analysing the text documents (Pang et al 
2008). Nowadays people are using web for writ-
ing their opinion on blogs, social networking 
websites, discussion forums etc. Hence, it is very 
much needed to analyse these web contents. 
Thus, it increases the demand of sentiment analy-
sis research.  Sentiment analysis has been very 
important for the users as well as for business 
with the drastic increase of online content. For 
users, it is important to know past experiences 
about some product or services for taking deci-
sion in purchasing products. Companies can use 
sentiment analysis in improving their products 
based on the users? feedback written about their 
products on blogs. E-commerce based companies 
know the online trends about the products. Ex-
ample of sentiment analysis is - knowing which 
model of a camera is liked by most of the users. 
Sentiment classification can be considered as a 
text classification problem. Bag-of-Words 
(BOW) representation is commonly used for sen-
timent classification using machine learning ap-
proaches. The words present in all the documents 
create the feature vector. Generally, this feature 
vector is huge in dimension that is used by ma-
chine learning methods for classification. This 
high dimensional feature vector deteriorates the 
performance of machine learning algorithm. 
Rough set theory has been used for reducing the 
feature vector size for text classification (Jensen 
et al 2001; Jensen et al 2009; Wakaki et al 
2004). However, it has not been investigated for 
sentiment analysis yet.   
Contribution of this paper:- 
1. Rough Set theory based feature selection 
method is applied for sentiment classification. 
2. Hybrid Feature selection method is proposed 
based on Rough Set and Information Gain which 
performs better than other feature selection meth-
ods. 
3. Proposed methods are experimented with four 
different standard datasets.  
The paper is organized as follows: A brief discus-
sion of the earlier research work is given in Sec-
tion 2. Section 3 describes the feature selections 
method used for sentiment classification. Dataset, 
Experimental setup and results are discussed in

sions.

2 Related Work  
Machine Learning methods have been widely 
applied for sentiment analysis (Pang et al 2008; 
Pang et al 2002; Tan et al 2008). Pang and Lee 
(2004) experimented with various features like 
unigrams, bi-grams and adjectives for sentiment 
classification of movie reviews using different 
machine learning algorithms namely Na?ve Bayes 
(NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and 
Maximum-Entropy (ME). Feature selection 
methods improve the performance of sentiment 
classification by eliminating the noisy and irrele-
vant features from feature vector. Tan et al 
(2008) investigated with various feature selection 
methods with different machine learning algo-
rithm for sentiment classification. Their experi-
mental results show that IG performs better as 
compared to other feature selection methods and 
SVM is best machine learning algorithms. Cate-
gorical Probability Proportion Difference (CPPD) 
feature selection method is proposed which com-
putes the importance of a feature based on its 
class discriminating ability for sentiment classifi-
cation (Agarwal et al 2012). Various features are 
extracted from the text for sentiment classifica-
tion. Further, Minimum Redundancy Maximum 
Relevancy (mRMR) and IG feature selection 
methods are used to select prominent features for 
better sentiment classification by machine learn-
ing algorithms (Agarwal et al 2013). 
Rough set based dimensionality reduction method 
is applied for data reduction to characterize 
bookmarks and it is compared with conventional 
entropy based reduction method (Jensen et al 
2009). Dimension reduction method based on 
fuzzy-rough sets and Ant Colony Optimization 
(ACO) method is proposed (Jensen et al 2006), 
which is applied to the web categorisation prob-
lem. Experimental result show significant reduc-
tion in the data redundancy. Rough set theory is 
applied to select relevant features for web-page 
classification. Their experimental results show 
that the rough set based feature selection method 
with SVM gives better accuracy (Wakaki et al 
2004). Applicability of RS theory for various ex-
isting text classification techniques are discussed 
in detail with e-mail categorization as an example 
application (Chouchoulas et al 2001). 
 
3 Methodology Used  
3.1 Rough Set Attribute Reduction (RSAR) 
Rough Sets Theory (RST) (Jensen et al 2007) is 
a mathematical tool to make attribute reduction 
by eliminating redundant condition attributes 
(features). The rough set is the approximation of a 
vague concept (set) by a pair of precise concepts, 
called lower and upper approximations. Rough 
Set Attribute Reduction (RSAR) (Jensen et al 
2007) is a filter based method by which redun-
dant features are eliminated by keeping the 
amount of knowledge intact in the System.  Basic 
intuition behind RSAR is that objects belonging 
to the same category (same attributes) are not dis-
tinguishable (Jensen et al 2009). 
RSAR algorithm finds the vague attributes which 
do not have important role in the classification. 
Therefore, it is needed to remove redundant fea-
tures without changing the knowledge embedded 
in the information system. An important issue in 
data analysis is to discover dependencies between 
the attributes. QUICKREDUCT method (Jensen 
et al 2007; Jensen et al 2009) calculate a mini-
mal reduct without exhaustively generating all 
possible subsets, it is used in our experiments for 
obtaining optimal feature subset. Main advantage 
of RSAR is that it does not require any additional 
parameter to operate like threshold is required in 
case of IG. 
 
3.2 Information Gain (IG) 
 
Information gain (IG) is one of the important fea-
ture selection techniques for sentiment classifica-
tion. IG is used to select important features with 
respect to class attribute. It is measured by the 
reduction in the uncertainty in identifying the 
class attribute when the value of the feature is 
known. The top ranked (important) features are 
selected for reducing the feature vector size in 
turn better classification results.  
3.3. Proposed Hybrid Approach to Feature 
Selection  
The usefulness of an attribute is determined by 
both its relevancy and redundancy. An attribute is 
relevant if it is predictive to the class attribute, 
otherwise it is irrelevant. An attribute is consid-
116
ered to be redundant if it is correlated with other 
attributes. Hence, The Aim is to find the attrib-
utes that are highly correlated with the class at-
tribute, but not with other attributes for a good 
attribute subset (Jensen et al 2007). 
Information Gain based feature selection methods 
determine the importance of a feature in the doc-
uments. But, it has disadvantage that threshold 
value is required initially which is not known 
generally. This method does not consider the re-
dundancy among the attributes. In addition, it will 
return large number of features when massive 
amount of documents are to be considered. RSAR 
can reduce most of the irrelevant and noisy fea-
tures. It reduces the redundancy among the fea-
tures. It has advantage that it considers the 
dependency of combination of features on deci-
sion attribute in contrast to other conventional 
feature selection methods (Jensen et al 2007). 
However, it has some disadvantages. Firstly, to 
get an optimal reduct is a NP-hard problem, some 
heuristic algorithms are used to get approximate 
reduction (Jensen et al 2004; Jensen et al 2009). 
Secondly, it is very time consuming. Therefore, 
an integrated method is developed which can re-
duce most of the redundant features and get the 
minimal feature set with reduced time complexity 
for sentiment classification. 
Proposed Algorithm works in two steps. Firstly, 
Information Gain (IG) of each feature is comput-
ed and all the features are taken which has infor-
mation gain value to be greater than 0. So that 
initially irrelevant and noisy features are removed 
from the feature vector, by this a lot computation-
al efforts are reduced. Main assumption and mo-
tivation behind this step is that IG would 
eliminate the features which are likely to be noisy 
and irrelevant features. Further, Reduced feature 
set is sent to the RSAR feature selection method 
to get optimal feature subset. So, by combining 
both the methods a feature selection is proposed 
which is more efficient in terms of computational 
and time complexity.  
4 Dataset Used and Experimental Setup 
For the evaluation of the proposed method, one of 
the most popular publically available movie re-
view dataset (Pang et al 2004) is used. This 
standard dataset contains 2000 reviews compris-
ing 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. 
Product review dataset consisting amazon prod-
ucts reviews is also used provided by Blitzer et al 
(2007).  We used product reviews of books, DVD 
and electronics for experiments. Each domain has 
1000 positive and 1000 negative labelled reviews.  
Documents are initially pre-processed as follows: 
 (i) Negation handling is performed as Pang et al 
(2002), ?NOT_? is added to every words occur-
ring after the negation word (no, not, isn?t, can?t, 
never, couldn?t, didn?t, wouldn?t, don?t) and first 
punctuation mark in the sentence. 
 (ii) Words occurring in less than 3 documents are 
removed from the feature set. 
Binary weighting scheme has been identified as a 
better weighting scheme as compared to frequen-
cy based schemes for sentiment classification 
(Pang et al 2002); therefore we also used binary 
weighting method for representing text. In addi-
tion, there is no need of using separate discretisa-
tion method in case of binary weighting scheme 
as required by RSAR feature selection algorithm.  
Noisy and irrelevant features are eliminated from 
the feature vector generated after pre-processing 
using various feature selection methods discussed 
before. Further, prominent feature vector is used 
by machine learning algorithms. Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) and Na?ve Bayes (NB) classifi-
ers are the mostly used for sentiment classifica-
tion (Pang et al 2002; Tan et al 2008). 
Therefore, we report the classification results of 
SVM and NB classifier for classifying review 
documents into positive or negative sentiment 
polarity. For the evaluation of proposed methods 
10 fold cross validation method is used. F-
measure value is reported as a performance 
measure of various classifiers (Agarwal et al 
2013) 
 
4.1 Experimental results and discussions 
 
Initially, unigram features are extracted from the 
review documents. Feature set without using any 
feature selection method is taken as a baseline. 
Further, various feature selection algorithms are 
used for selecting optimal feature subset. IG is 
used for comparison with the proposed feature 
selection method as it has been considered as one 
of the best feature selection method for sentiment 
classification (Pang et al 2008; Tan et al 2008). 
Feature subsets obtained after applying RSAR, IG 
117
and proposed hybrid feature selection algorithm 
are called Rough features, IG features and Hybrid 
IG-Rough features respectively. Feature vector 
lengths for various features used for sentiment 
classification of different datasets are shown in 
Table 1.  In the experiments, Firstly, RSAR algo-
rithm is applied to get the best optimal feature 
subset. Further, according to the feature subset 
size obtained from RSAR method, threshold is set 
for IG based to get the feature vector, which is 
further used for classification. Experiments are 
conducted in this way so that results of Rough 
features and IG features can be compared.

Table 1. Feature Length for Various Features Used 
With Four Datasets 
Experimental results show that both feature selec-
tion methods (RSAR and IG) are able to improve 
the performance from baseline (as shown in Table 
2). For example from Table 2, F-measure is in-
creased from 84.2% to 85.9% (+2.1) and 85.6% 
(+1.6) for Rough features and IG features respec-
tively with SVM classifier when movie review 
dataset is considered. Similarly, when electronics 
dataset is used, SVM classifier increased the per-
formance from 76.5% to 82.9% (+8.3) and 81.1% 
(+6.01) for Rough and IG features. It is due to the 
fact that RSAR algorithm removes the redundan-
cy and selects the prominent feature subset, and 
IG selects the top ranked features by its im-
portance to the class attribute.  
When hybrid features selection approach is used 
for movie review dataset, F- measure is increased 
from 84.2% to 87.7 (+4.15) for SVM classifier as 
given in Table 1. Hybrid IG-Rough features gives 
better classification results as compare to other 
features with very small feature vector length. It 
is due to the fact that IG in its first phase elimi-
nates the irrelevant and noisy features and in se-
cond phase RSAR algorithm decreases the 
redundancy among features and extracts the op-
timal feature subset. By combining both the 
methods, a more robust feature selection method 
is developed for sentiment classification which is 
more efficient in selecting optimal feature set for 
massive dataset. Because when dataset size would 
be very large, RSAR algorithm will take much 
time and IG algorithm would be having problem 
of large feature size and pre-setting the threshold 
value.

5 Conclusion 
Rough set based dimension reduction method is 
applied for sentiment analysis. It is capable of 
reducing the redundancy among the attributes. 
Rough set based methods computes the best fea-
ture subset based on minimized redundancy in 
contrast to information gain which computes the 
importance of the attribute based on the entropy. 
Hybrid feature selection method is proposed 
which is based on RSAR and IG. Experimental 
results show that Hybrid feature selection method 
with very less number of features produces better 
results as compared to other feature selection 
methods. All the methods are experimented using 
four standard datasets. In future, more methods 
can be explored for making rough set based fea-
ture selection method computationally more effi-
cient by incorporating evolutionary approaches in 
selecting feature subsets.
