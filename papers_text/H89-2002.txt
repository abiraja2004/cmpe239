ABSTRACT 
We address the role of prosody as a potential information source for the assignment of syntactic structure. 
We consider the perceptual role of prosody in marking syntactic breaks of various kinds for human listeners, 
the automatic extraction of prosodic information, and its correlation with perceptual data. 
INTRODUCTION 
Prosodic information can mark lexical stress, identify phrasing breaks, and provide information useful for 
semantic interpretation. Each of these aspects of prosody can benefit a spoken language system (SLS). We 
concentrate in this report on the use of prosody in parsing, through perceptual studies and through modeling 
the correlation of duration patterns with stress patterns and with syntactic structures. 
It is rare that prosody alone disambiguates otherwise phonetically identical phrases. However, it is also 
rare that any one source of information (spectral or temporal) is the so/e feature that separates one phrase 
from all competitors. We argue here that prosody can provide information useful to a parser. TAking 
advantage of this information in parsing can make a spoken language system more accurate and more 
efficient, if prosodic-syntactic mlnmatches, or unlikely matches, can be pruned out. There is a vast literature 
on the perception and production of prosodic information. Our goal is to show that at least some of this 
information can be automatically extracted and used to improve speech recognition and understanding. 
Figure represents a strategy for using prosody to improve speech understanding. Prosodic features 
extracted from speech will be analysed by the prosody module which will communicate both with the 
speech recognition component and with the language processin 8 component. For example, phone durations 
from the speech recognition module can be used by the prosodic module to hypothesise stress patterns and 
prosodic structure, which in turn can be checked in the speech recognition component for consistency with 
the dictionary's lexical stress patterns and with the application of phonological rules in the hypothesized 
word strings. SimilArly, the consistency of syntactic, semantic and discourse structures from the language 
processing component can be verified against he prosodic structures hypothesized. 
The complete integration of the prosodic module with speech and language components i  an ambitious 
goal. Our strategy for atts~nin S this goal is to 1) assess the potential of various types of prosodic information 
through perceptual experiments and thzough analysis of recognition and parsing errors, 2) for those aspects 
of prosody that appear to have the greatest potential, develop computational models using linguistic theory 
to help determine the units and structure of the models, and using statistical models to help account for 
variability and to allow for automatic training, and 3) evaluate the models and algorithms by comparing the 
model's output with hud  labels, by comparing human discrimination with the system's performance, and 
by assessing the accuracy and speed of an SLS with and without the prosodic module. We report here on our 
initial experiments involving a) the perception of various types of syntactic structures marked by prosody, 
b) the coding of prosodic information for parsing, and c) the automatic labeling of prosodic structures. 
PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENTS 
Prosodic structure and syntactic structures are not, of course, completely identical. Rhythmic structures and 
the necessity of breathing influence the prosodic structure, but not the syntactic structure (Gee and Grosjean

1983, Cooper and Paccia-Cooper 1980 ). Further, there are likely some types of syntactic structures that are 
not typically marked prosodicslly. In order to help focus our study on syntactic structures that correlate well 
with prosody, we designed a perceptual experiment involving phonetically-ambiguous, structurally-different 
pairs of sentences. 
The sentence pairs were read by a professional radio announcer in disambiguating contexts. In order 
to discourage unnatural exaggerations of any differences between sentences, the materials were recorded in 
different sessions with several days in between. In each session only one sentence of each pair occurred. 
Sixteen listeners heard the sentences without he dissmbiguatlng contexts and were asked to select which 
context on the answer sheet was more likely for the sentence heard. Listeners were also asked to put a check 
next to contexts for which they were particularly confident of their judgments. The listeners were all native 
speakers of English , naive with respect o the purpose of the study. Again, two different listening sessions 
with several weeks in between were used, and only one member of each sentence pair occurred in the same 
session. 
Seven types of structural ambignity were investigated: 1)parentheticals, 2) apposition, 3) main-main vs. 
main subordinate clauses, 4) tags, 5) near vs. far attachment, 8) left vs. right attachment, and 7) particles 
vs. prepositions. Each type of ambignity was represented by five pairs of sentences. We list a sample 
from each class with their disambigusting contexts in the Appendix. In each case, the "s" member of the 
sentence-pairs has st least one location with s mote major break than the corresponding location in the "b" 
version. 
The results in Table 1 show that, on the average, subjects did well above chance (86% correct) in 
assigning the sentences to their appropriate contexts, although subjects were confident of their judgments 
only about 58% of the time. In general, the sentences with the more major breaks ("a" versions) were more 
reliably identified (90% sccurate) compared to the "b" versions (83% accurate), though this difference did 
not correspond to s difference in the subjects' confidence. This suggests that breaks that are strongly marked 
prosodically may be relatively unambiguous, whereas locations where no break information is observed should 
not rule out the possihility that a prosodically unmarked syntactic break may exist. 
The subjects were least able to identify the main-main vs. main-subordinate pairs (77% accurate, 41%

position pairs (94% accurate, 75% confident) and the left vs. right attachment pairs (94% accurate, 74% 
confident). The table alno indicates differences related to the "an and "bn versions by structural category. Be- 
cause of significant differences across sentences even within a structural category, more perceptual judgments 
and productions of the same sentences by different speakers are required to assess these differences. 
Of particular interest for database query tasks are categories 3, 5, 6 and 7 (parenthetical expressions, 
apposition and tags may be rare in database queries). These categories cover the range of observed accu- 
racies from worst to best. We plan to concentrate in the future on prepositional phrases. Prepositions are 
very frequent (about 75% of the Resource Management sentences (Price et d. 1988 ) have one or more 
prepositional phrases), and nearly all sentences with prepositional phrases are syntactically ambiguous. The 
perceptual results indicate that it may be possible to help resolve syntactic ambiguity on the basis of prosodic 
information. One can expect structural ambiguity to pose even more of a problem for a parser when the 
input is speech rather than text, because of the additional ambiguities of word identity and word boundaries. 
CODING PROSODIC INFORMATION FOR PARSING 
A formalism has been devised for coding, or labeling, prosodic information in a form useful to a parser. 
Phrase boundary information M indicated by a "breakn index, a number which indicates by its relative sire 
the degree of prosodic deeoupling of neighboring words. The example below illustrates how phrase boundary 
information can be used to distinguish particles and prepositions.

In addition, words with relatively high prominence can be marked with * (prominence) and ** (high 
prominence) following that word. Another example illustrates that prominence information may provide 
cues which disambiguate the sentences, even when phrase boundary information does not disambiguate the 
sentence.

We found that we could reliably label these sentences with prominences and with break indices, with good 
agreement within and across labelers. In ten pairs of sentences examined from categories 5, 6, and 7, the 
syntactic structures were all clearly disambiguated by the perceived (hand-labeled) phrase break indices in

all but one case. The prominences u ually provided additional support for the syntactic structure, and in one 
case ("they rose early in May") provided the sole support for disambiguation. Because these initial results 
were encouraging, we began to search for acoustic orrelates of the perceptual results. 
AUTOMATIC  DETECT ION OF PROSODIC  CUES 
In order to automatically abel phrase breaks, several sources of information will no doubt be useful, including 
relative duration, pausing phenomena, boundary tones and syntactic structure. In our initial work, we have 
investigated independent modeling and detection of these cues. Later, the different algorithms will be 
combined in a statistical framework, for integration with the SRI spoken language system. Algorithms 
and experimental results for speaker-dependent de ection of breaks, lexical stress and boundary tones are 
described here. The results for the different algorithms are based on three databases - the ambiguous 
sentence database, a radio news story database, and the Resource Management database - according to the 
nature of the information being detected. Other work in prosodic phrase "language modeling", based on a 
deterministic parser coupled with a Markov model, is described elsewhere (Veilleux eta/.). 
Break Labeling 
Our main efforts have involved automatically generating break indices using phoneme duration, a very 
powerful cue. Phoneme durations were obtained from the SRI speaker-independent word recognition system 
(Weintraub eta/. 1980) by constraining the the recognizer so that the correct word sequence is recognized. 
The SRI recognition system is especially useful for this task, since the phonological rules allow for quite bushy 
word pronunciation networks. This means that the alignments have a better chance of being highly accurate, 
and that the phonetic labels thus obtained can be used to independently assess the phonetic ambiguity of 
the sentences investigated. 
Word break indices were generated by normalizing phoneme duration according to estimated mean and 
variance, and combining the average normalized uration factors of the final syllable coda consonants with 
a pause factor. Let ~ : (d~ - pj)/o'j be the normalized uration of the ith phoneme in the coda, where 
/~j and o'j are the mesa and standard eviation of duration for phone j. d~, is the duration (in ms) of the 
pause following the word, if any. A set of word break indices are computed for all the words in a sentence 
as follows: 
= +  IT0 
I 
(The term d~/70 was actually hard-limited at 4, so as not to give pauses too much weight.) The set .4 includes 
all coda consonants, but not the vowel nucleus unless the syllable nds in a vowel. Although, the vowel nucleus 
provides ome boundary cues, the lengthening associated with prominence can be confounded with boundary 
lengthening and the algorithm was slightly more reliable without using vowel nucleus information. These 
indices n are normalized over the sentence, assuming known sentence boundaries, to range from zero to five. 
As an initial step in assessing the use of prosody in parsing, we have examined the differences between 
ten of the phonetically ambiguous, minimal pair sentences described in the perceptual studies. The ten pairs 
included the particle-preposition a d attachment smbignities. These were chosen because these types of 
ambiguities seem to be relatively frequent in database queries. 
Word break indices were automatically generated using the algorithms described above, and the results 
were compared to perceptually abeled data. In 19 of the 20 sentences, the largest automatically labeled 
break within a sentence occured at the location of the largest perceived break, which disambiguated the 
sentence. In the other sentence, there was a large break (3 or 4) that correctly disambiguated the sentence, 
though not the largest break. Hence, the duration model disambiguates sentences with 100% accuracy for 
this small set. The correlation coefficient between the hand-labeled break indices and the automatically 
generated break indices is 0.85. 
Lexical Stress Assignment 
Duration was also investigated as a cue for predicting lexicai stress. Assuming known word segmentations, 
the lexical stress pattern for multi-syllabic words was estimated based on vowel durations normalized by a 
window of three successive, neighboring vowels. On a 25-sentence test set from the Resource Management 
database, this algorithm yielded 90% correct lexical stress pattern prediction. 
Breath  Detect ion  
For speech that involves more than one sentence or long sentences, peakers typically take breaths. In 
addition, breaths are highly correlated with major prosodic breaks. We have studied the use of breaths in 
several minutes of radio news speech. 85% of sentence boundaries (break index 5) are marked by breaths 
and 53% of major phrase boundaries (break index 4) are also marked by breaths. In addition, the acoustic 
realization of a breath is quite distinctive, indicating that a breath detection might provide a very reliable 
phrase break cue. 
A breath detection algorithm was developed based on a Gaussian classifier. A fourteen-dimensional full 
covariance Gaussian distribution was estimated for cepstral features. To compensate for session dependent 
effects, the cepstral features were normalised by session mean and variance. The classifier labeled successive 
frames of speech according to a threshold chosen to constrain false detection rate. A segment of speech was 
labeled as a breath if 23 out of 25 sequential frames were labeled as "breath". 
The Gaussian distribution was estimated using data from three dilTerent 2-3 minute news stories (three 
sessions). Separate data from the same stories was used to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm detected 
78 out of 83 breaths (93% correct detection) and inserted one breath. The breaths labeled by the algorithm 
are within 50 ms of those labeled by hand 95% of the time. In addition, the algorithm detected one breath 
that was not detected perceptually by four listeners. 
Boundary  Tone  C lass i f i ca t ion  
Boundary tones are another important cue for phrase boundary detection and for semantic interpretation. 
The boundary tone study is based on a speaker-dependent radio news story database. 
The three news stories described above were perceptually abeled for two types of boundary tones at 
every major phrase break: final fall and continuation rise. A classifier for boundary tones in known final 
phrase syllable locations was designed using hidden Markov models of intonation. The classifier was based on 
earlier work with hidden Markov models of isolated intonation patterns (Butsberger, Ostendorf and Price). 
The classifier used as input only quantised F0 estimates. Using a resubstitution error estimate, 76% of the 
boundary tones were correctly classified. These results are encouraging because many of the boundary tones 
were impossible to visually classify because of pitch tracking errors. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have shown through perceptual experiments hat several types of syntactic ambiguities can be resolved 
with prosodic information, we have developed a prosodic information codin 8 system suitable for a parser, 
and we have developed automatic algorithms for extraction of information that correlates well with perceived 
prosodic phenomena. 
These initial results are very encouraging; we plan to test the algorithm on a larger set of sentences 
by more talkers. Changing from speech read by professional speakers to spontaneous speech from random 
speakers will no doubt require modification of the algorithms. The next steps in this research will include I) 
further investigation of the relationship between prosody and syntax, including the different roles of phrase 
breaks and prominences in marking syntactic structure; 2) improvement of the prosodic labeling algorithm 
by incorporating intonation and syntactic/semantic information; and 3) incorporating the automatically 
labeled information i  the parser of the SRI Spoken Language System (Moore, Pereira and Murveit 1989). 
We expect he prosodic information to resolve structural ambiguities, and also to increase the speed of the 
parser by eliminating prosodicaJJy inconsistent hypotheses. The tighter the integration scheme between the 
acoustic information and the syntactic information, the more potential gain we can expect from prosody.
