Abstract 
Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation 
systems produce semantically accurate translations, 
but typically require massive knowledge acquisi- 
tion. Ongoing research and development a the 
Center for Machine Translation has focussed on re- 
ducing this requirement to produce large-scale prac- 
tical applications ofknowledge-based MT. This pa- 
per describes KANT, the first system to combine 
principled source language design, semi-automated 
knowledge acquisition, and know ledge compilation 
techniques toproduce fast, high-quality ranslation 
to multiple languages. 
1 Overv iew 
Any expert system is only as good as the knowledge pro- 
grammed into it; the same is true of a knowledge-based trans- 
lation system. A KBMT system can only produce accurate, 
high-quality translations if it can unambiguously determine 
the meaning of the input ext and choose an appropriate phras- 
ing of that meaning in the target language. This implies a 
significant domain knowledge base in addition to the usual 
syntactic grammars, lexicons, etc. The question is, how much 
knowledge isenough? 
It is probably the case that the implementation f a world 
knowledge base sufficient to support knowledge-based trans- 
lation in any domain of discourse issome years from realiza- 
tion. Nevertheless, there are significant practical problems in 
translation that can be solved with current knowledge-based 
technology, because they do not require general translation iu
all domains of discourse, In particular, we have explored the 
use of machine translation for multi-languageoutput in a con- 
trolled authoring environment for technical documentation. 
Our goal has been to identify and develop the following: 
? Principled esigns for source language t xts that encour- 
age concise, expressive authoring while supporting effi- 
cient ranslation; 
? Algorithms for knowledge-based interpretation f text 
that effectively disambiguate source language sentences; 
? A powerful yet efficient rule foraralism for target ext 
generation; 
? A combination ofautomatic and semi-automatic knowl- 
edge acquisition tools to streamline the creation of large- 
scale knowledge bases for translation i a particular ap- 
plication domain; 
? Techniques for the compilation of knowledge bases that 
support a clear, declarative style of input for the lin- 
guist/knowledge engineer and produce fficient run-time 
knowledge sources for translation; 
? A modular system architecture that allows extension to 
additional target languages without any change to exist- 
ing knowledge. 
In this project note, we describe the development of these 
ideas in the KANT system, a knowledge-based interlingua 
translation system for multi-lingual document production. We 
believe that KANT is the first system to bring these ideas 
together in a system that provides fast, accurate, high-quality 
knowledge-based translation. 
A complete working prototype of the KANT architecture 
which translates to French, German, and Japanese has been 
demonstrated successfully, and KANT is currently being ex- 
tended in a large-scale commercial pplication for document 
production i  several languages. 
1.1 Controlled Input Language 
There are two broad classes of restrictions which KANT 
places on the source text. The first concerns the vocabu- 
lary used by the author. The general (non-domain specific) 
words used in the source text are limited to a basic vocabulary 
of about 14,000 distinct word seuses. The domain-specific 
technical terms are limited to a pre-defined vocabulary. The 
second restriction concerns the level of syntactic complexity 
present in the source text. KANT limits the use of con- 
structions that would create unnecessary ambiguity or other 
ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES. 23-28 Atilt 1992 1 0 6 9 Pkoc. OF COLING-92, NANTES. AUG. 23-28. 1992 
difficulties in parsing, while still providing the author with a 
subset of English which is large enough to support authoriug 
of clear, understandable technical prose. For example, KANT 
allows the use of subject-gap relative clauses with an explicit 
relative pronoun (e.g., "Clean the ventilation slots which are 
located on the rear of the chassis"), but does not allow reduced 
relative clauses. An example of a controlled input language 
text is shown in Figure 2. 
Previous attempts to define controlled input languages for 
translation have tried to reduce complexity by either limiting 
the vocabulary to a very small size or by limiting syntax to 
just a few constructions t. In contrast to systems which limit 
vocabulary to just a few thousand words, KANT allows a 
larger vocabulary tobe represented in the lexicon. KANT also 
places principled grammatical limitations on the source text 
that are loose enough to allow a degree of stylistic variation 
which supports productive authoring, while controlling the 
complexity of the input in areas that are crucial for accurate 
translation. 
1.2 Knowledge-Based Parsing and Interpretation 
Although it is possible to reduce ambiguity by limiting the 
use of certain kinds of phrases, some phrases which intro- 
duce a high level of ambiguity (such as prepositional phrases) 
cannot be ruled out. To resolve the ambiguity introduced by 
multiple possible phrase attachments, KANT uses an explicit 
domain model to narrow the set of potential interpretations 
(cf. Figure 1). For every phrase (such as verb phrase or noun 
phrase) that accepts a potentially ambiguous phrase attach- 
ment (such as a prepositional phrase), KANT constrains the 
set of allowable attached phrases to just those that meet the 
narrow semantic restrictions of the particular domain. The 
system's domain model is rich enough to allow all interpreta- 
tions possible within the domain, but narrow enough to rule 
out irrelevant interpretations, The complexity of the domain 
model is only as deep as required to resolve ambiguity, which 
is the appropriate criterion for limiting the size of a domain 
model in a practical KBMT system. 
By constraining the set of possible syntactic structures and 
ruling out ambiguous interpretations, it is possible for KANT 
to assign a complete and accurate semantic representation 
to each input sentence. Although the creation of a compre- 
hensive set of mapping rules requires intensive development, 
we have eliminated redundancy through structure-sharing a d 
pre-compilation (Mitamura, 1989; Mitamura and Nyberg, 
1990). Interpretation rules are organized into an inheritance 
hierarchy, so that general rules can be shared via inheritance; 
the hierarchy is then pre-compiled into cached structures for 
fast access at ran-time. 
1.3 A Powerful Rule Formalism for Generation 
High-quality output in an Interlingua-based system presup- 
poses a generation component that is powerful and flexible, 
IFor example, the Multinational Customized F.nglish used by XEROX 
Corporation (De Mauro and Russo, 1984)helped to decrease post-editing 
to Ihe point where semi-automated translation became 5 times faster than 
manual translation. 
allowing the system to create accurate target text realizations 
which do not necessarily reflect he syntactic organization of
the source text or the structure of the Interlingua Text. The 
Mapper module of the system makes use of a set of mapping 
rules and a lexicon to create the appropriate Target F-Structure 
for each Interlinguarepresentation (cf. Figure 1). Each map- 
ping rule is intended to apply to a single Interlingua concept, 
which may contain other Interlingan concepts as slot fillers; 
the Mapper uses a recursive-descent f-s ructure composition 
algorithm, which is discussed in (Nyberg et al, 1991). 
A mapping rule combines three types of information: a
pattern slot, a context that must match the Interlingua concept 
to be mapped; a syn slot, a pointer to the lexical item to be 
used to realize the concept; and a map slot, which specifies 
how the embedded components of the Interlingua map to 
grammatical functions in the Target F-Structure. For example, 
the following rule maps the lnterlingua concept * E-REMOVE 
to the French verb ddposer in the appropriate context: 
lgle~ *remove 
(pattern 
(theme (*or* *o-frame *o-chassis))) 
(syn 
(cat verb) 
(root "d6poser") ) 
(map (theme obj) ) ) 
The English sentence Remove the chassis would be translated 
to Drposer le ctMssis using this rule. 
1.4 Automated and Semi-Automated Tools for 
Knowledge Acquisition 
Since knowledge-based translation systems rely on the use of 
complex knowledge sources, knowledge acquisition becomes 
the single most important (and time-consuming) task during 
system development. The system must provide the developer 
with an efficient way to specify and incrementally refine both 
domain knowledge and linguistic knowledge. In addition, 
those parts of the development process that are most repetitive 
(such as the extraction of vocabulary lists from a text corpus) 
should be automated. The tools that are currently being used 
in the development of KANT applications include: 
,, Structured Tools for Editing Domain Knowledge 
Sources. We use the ONTOS knowledge acquisition 
tool, developed at the Center for Machine Translation, 
for the creation and update of our domain model (Kauf- 
mann, 1991). ONTOS incorporates a graphic browser 
interface for rapid access with an integrated, structured 
editor to support development of large-scale domain hi- 
erarchies (Carlson and Nirenbuig, 1990). 
? Automatic Corpus Analysis Tools. To analyze quickly 
sample corpora fora domain under development, KANT 
makes use of automatic corpus analysis tools that seg- 
ment the text and pre-proeess it to produce preliminary 
vocabulary lists. The tagged corpora re then available 
for selective on-line development and debugging of lin- 
guistic knowledge sources.

* Semi-Automated Acquisition ~lbols. Following corpus 
analysis, KANT automatically extracts a syntactic lexi- 
con and set of interpretation rules for the sample corpus. 
This is achieved by extracting the relevant vocabulary 
items from a master lexicon, and using a pre-defined 
mapping rule hierarchy and default mapping rule tem- 
plates. These knowledge sources are then incrementally 
refined by the system developer once the bulk of the 
tedious work has been done automatically. 
We are currently extending our tools so that they may be 
used to partially automate the process of knowledge acqui- 
sition for generation lexicons, grammars and mapping rules. 
We anticipate that this should not be difficult, since the for- 
malisms used for generation knowledge are similar to those 
used in analysis. 
1.5 Knowledge Ire-compilation for Run-time Efficiency 
Knowledge-based translation systems require the use of sev- 
eral complex knowledge sources (e.g., grammars, mapping 
rules, domain models, etc.). It is important to support he 
declarative specification of knowledge sources to facilitate 
knowledge acquisition by human experts; on the other hand, 
it is absolutely necessary to encode that knowledge at run- 
time in the most efficient procedural form possible. Our 
system uses the Generalized LR Parser-Compiler (Tomita et 
al., 1988) to compile the LFG source grammar into a last, 
efficient run-time parsing table. The GenKit grammar com- 
piler (Tomita & Nyberg, 1988) is used to compile the LFG 
target grammar into a set of efficient CommonLisp functions 
for generation, which are further compiled into object code by 
the CommonLisp compiler. Our analysis and generation map- 
ping rules are compiled into decision trees which optimize the 
amount of processing required to locate and evaluate the most 
appropriate mapping rule for a given syntactic structure or 
Interlingua concept. Although these compilation techniques 
have afforded us a high degree of run-time fficiency and 
acceptable translation speed, we are currently investigating 
the cross-compilation f our system into C to achieve further 
speed-up. 
1.6 Modular System Architecture 
To support efficient development of multi-lingual translation 
capability, KANT has a modular system architecture. The 
parser and generator a e independent components ( ee Figure 
1); as a result, any source language supported by the sys- 
tem can be translated toany target language supported by the 
system. This architecture allows knowledge sources for dif- 
ferent languages to be combined easily in new applications 
to support rations ource and target combinations. It is also 
the case that a modular design decreases development time, 
since it allows parallel development of knowledge bases for 
the source and target language(s). 
Each linguistic processing module in our system consists 
of a procedural nd a declarative component, the procedural 
component capturing the general algorithm to be used, and 
the declarative component representing the specific knowl- 
edge required by that algorithm for a particular language. 
This makes it possible to add new knowledge for additional 
languages without having to re-write the general code for the 
system modules. 
2 Character i s t i cs  o f  the  KANT System 
The KANT architecture has the following characteristics: 
? Semantic Accuracy and Completeness. 
"lb be semantically accurate, a system must produce a
complete, correct and unambiguous Interlingua repre- 
sentation for each input sentence; it must also produce a
complete, correct and unambiguous output sentence for 
each Interlingua representation. In a narrow technical 
domain, KANT achieves near-perfect semantic accuracy. 
Once all relevant domain knowledge has been acquired 
by the system, the Interpreter is able to disambiguate any 
potentiaUy ambiguous structural ttachments to remove 
spurious interpretations of the input. The Interpreter 
also discards any lnteflingua representations which are 
not complete interpretations of the Source F-Structure. 
? Grammatical Accuracy. 
To achieve the objective of no post-editing, semantic ac- 
curacy by itself does not suffice. Accurate Interlingua 
representations cannot be produced unless the system 
has an adequate grasp of the source language syntax; nor 
can the system produce accurate target ext from an ac- 
curate Interlingua unless it has adequate coverage of the 
target language syntax. In addition to purely semantic 
information, the Interlingaa must also represent certain 
features of the input text, such as modality, aspect, dis- 
course markers, etc. in order to generate grammatically 
accurate output exts. Our system uses explicit syntactic 
grammars, written in the LFG grammatical formalism, 
for the source language and target language(s). Our 
grammars include rules to handle both the basic semen- 
tial syntax of the language and discourse-level markers. 
? High Quality Output. 
To go beyond semantic and grammatical ccuracy and 
produce stylistically correct output, a translation system 
must have a good grasp of the textual structure of the 
target language as well as its sentential syntax. This 
requires an explicit representation f textual relations 
between clauses and sentences, and the ability to select 
and produce complex sentence structures when appro- 
priate. The mapping rules used by KANT's Mapper can 
not only select the correct single phrase for an Inter- 
lingua concept, but also create more complex syntactic 
constructions when appropriate. Thus the ability of the 
system to generate stylistically correct output is limited 
only by the amount of effort dedicated to the construction 
of mapping rules for the target language.

3 Current Results 
The present KANT prototype produces very accurate transla- 
tions, without human disambiguation r post-editing, such as 
those illustrated in Figures 3-5. The system has been tested 
on a corpus of several hundred sentences of pre-authored text, 
with 100% accuracy and good quality. We intend to extend 
incrementally the coverage of KANT, while simultaneously 
maintaining the current level of accuracy and speed, in or- 
der to provide a smooth transition path from prototype to a 
larger-scale application system. 
? The KANT prototype has been implemented in the do- 
main of technical electronics manuals, and translates 
from English to Japanese, French and German. 
? The current English lexicon contains about 14,000 gen- 
eral word senses and several hundred technical terms. 
The target language lexicons contain these technical 
terms and a smaller subset of the general terms, and 
are currently being extended. The eventual goal is to 
support a lexicon of 30-40,000 terms. 
? The current Domain Model contains over 500 concept 
frames, which correspond tothe meanings present in the 
sample corpora currently translated. We expect he size 
of the Domain Model to grow rapidly as more knowledge 
is acquired. 
? KANT is implemented in CMU CommonLisp, and runs 
on IBM APC/RT workstations, which are rated at about 
2.5 MIPS. Using this hardware, our system has achieved 
a translation speed of 1-3 seconds per sentence Faster 
translations are expected with newer hardware.
