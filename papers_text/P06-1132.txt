Abstract 
Japanese case markers, which indicate the gram-
matical relation of the complement NP to the 
predicate, often pose challenges to the generation 
of Japanese text, be it done by a foreign language 
learner, or by a machine translation (MT) system. 
In this paper, we describe the task of predicting 
Japanese case markers and propose machine 
learning methods for solving it in two settings: (i) 
monolingual, when given information only from 
the Japanese sentence; and (ii) bilingual, when 
also given information from a corresponding Eng-
lish source sentence in an MT context. We formu-
late the task after the well-studied task of English 
semantic role labelling, and explore features from 
a syntactic dependency structure of the sentence. 
For the monolingual task, we evaluated our models 
on the Kyoto Corpus and achieved over 84% ac-
curacy in assigning correct case markers for each 
phrase. For the bilingual task, we achieved an ac-
curacy of 92% per phrase using a bilingual dataset 
from a technical domain. We show that in both 
settings, features that exploit dependency informa-
tion, whether derived from gold-standard annota-
tions or automatically assigned, contribute signifi-
cantly to the prediction of case markers.1  
1 Introduction: why predict case? 
Generation of grammatical elements such as inflec-
tional endings and case markers has become an impor-
tant component technology, particularly in the context 
of machine translation (MT). In an English-to-Japanese 
MT system, for example, Japanese case markers, 
which indicate grammatical relations (e.g., subject, 
object, location) of the complement noun phrase to the 
predicate, are among the most difficult to generate 
appropriately. This is because the case markers often 
do not correspond to any word in the source language 
as many grammatical relations are expressed via word 
order in English. It is also difficult because the map-
ping between the case markers and the grammatical

 Author names arranged alphabetically 
relations they express is very complex. For the same 
reasons, generation of case markers is challenging to 
foreign language learners. This difficulty in generation, 
however, does not mean the choice of case markers is 
insignificant: when a generated sentence contains mis-
takes in grammatical elements, they often lead to se-
vere unintelligibility, sometimes resulting in a different 
semantic interpretation from the intended one. There-
fore, having a model that makes reasonable predictions 
about which case marker to generate given the content 
words of a sentence, is expected to help MT and gen-
eration in general, particularly when the source (or 
native) and the target languages are morphologically 
divergent.  
But how reliably can we predict case markers in 
Japanese using the information that exists only in the 
sentence? Consider the example in Figure 1. This sen-
tence contains two case markers, kara 'from' and ni, the 
latter not corresponding to any word in English. If we 
were to predict the case markers in this sentence, there 
are multiple valid answers for each decision, many of 
which correspond to different semantic relations. For 
example, for the first case marker slot in Figure 1 filled 
by kara, wa (topic marker), ni 'in' or no case marker at 
all are all reasonable choices, while other markers such 
as wo (object marker), de 'at', made 'until', etc. are not 
considered reasonable. For the second slot filled by ni, 
ga (subject marker) is also a grammatically reasonable 
choice, making Einstein the subject of idolize, thus 
changing the meaning of the sentence. As is obvious in 
this example, the choice among the correct answers is 
determined by the speaker's intent in uttering the sen-
tence, and is therefore impossible to recover from the 
content words or the sentence structure alone. At the 
same time, many impossible or unlikely case marking 
decisions can be eliminated by a case prediction model. 
Combined with an external component (for example an 
MT component) that can resolve semantic and inten-
tional ambiguity, a case prediction model can be quite 
useful in sentence generation. 
This paper discusses the task of case marker as-
signment in two distinct but related settings. After 
defining the task in Section 2 and describing our mod-
els in Section 3, we first discuss the monolingual task 
in Sections 4, whose goal is to predict the case markers 
1049
 using Japanese sentences and their dependency struc-
ture alone. We formulated this task after the 
well-studied task of semantic role labeling in English 
(e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and M?rques, 
2005), whose goal is to assign one of 20 semantic role 
labels to each phrase in a sentence with respect to a 
given predicate, based on the annotations provided by 
PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005). Though the task of 
case marker prediction is more ambiguous and subject 
to uncertainty than the semantic role labeling task, we 
obtained some encouraging results which we present in 
Section 4. Next, in Section 5, we describe the bilingual 
task, in which information about case assignment can 
be extracted from a corresponding source language 
sentence. Though the process of MT introduces uncer-
tainties in generating the features we use, we show that 
the benefit of using dependency structure in our mod-
els is far greater than not using it even when the as-
signed structure is not perfect.  
2 The task of case prediction 
In this section, we define the task of case prediction. 
We start with the description of the case markers we 
used in this study. 
2.1 Nominal particles in Japanese 
Traditionally, Japanese nominal postpositions are clas-
sified into the following three categories (e.g., Tera-
mura, 1991; Masuoka and Takubo, 1992):   
Case particles (or case markers). They indicate 
grammatical relations of the complement NP to the 
predicate. As they are jointly determined by the NP 
and the predicate, case markers often do not allow a 
simple mapping to a word in another language, which 
makes their generation more difficult. The relationship 
between the case marker and the grammatical relation 
it indicates is not straightforward either: a case marker 
can (and often does) indicate multiple grammatical 
relations as in Ainshutain-ni akogareru "idolize Ein-
stein" where ni marks the Object relation, and in To-
kyo-ni sumu "live in Tokyo" where ni indicates Loca-
tion. Conversely, the same grammatical relation may 
be indicated by different case markers: both ni and de 
in Tokyo-ni sumu "live in Tokyo" and Tokyo-de au 
"meet in Tokyo" indicate the Location relation. We 
included 10 case markers as the primary target of pre-
diction, as shown in the first 10 lines of Table 1. 
Conjunctive particles. These particles are used to 
conjoin words and phrases, corresponding to English 
"and" and "or". As their occurrence is not predictable 
from the sentence structure alone, we did not include 
them in the current prediction task.  
Focus particles. These particles add focus to a phrase 
against a given background or contextual knowledge, 
for example shika and mo in pasuta-shika tabenakatta 
"ate only pasta" and pasuta-mo tabeta "also ate pasta", 
corresponding to only and also respectively. Note that 
they often replace case markers: in the above examples, 
the object marker wo is no longer present when shika 
or mo is used. As they add information to the predi-
cate-argument structure and are in principle not pre-
dictable given the sentence structure alone, we did not 
consider them as the target of our task. One exception 
is the topic marker wa, which we included as a target 
of prediction for the following reasons:  
 Some linguists recognize wa as a topic marker, 
separately from other focus particles (e.g. Masuoka 
and Takubo, 1992). The main function of wa is to 
introduce a topic in the sentence, which is to a some 
extent predictable from the structure of the sentence.  
 wa is extremely frequent in Japanese text. For ex-
ample, it accounts for 13.2% of all postpositions in 
Kyoto University Text Corpus (henceforth Kyoto 
Corpus, Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997), making it the 
third most frequent postposition after no (20.57%) 
and wo (13.5%). Generating wa appropriately thus 
greatly enhances the readability of the text.   
 Unlike other focus particles such as shika and mo, 
wa does not translate into any word in English, 
which makes it difficult to generate by using the in-
formation from the source language.  
Therefore, in addition to the 10 true case markers, we 
also included wa as a case marker in our study.2 Fur-
thermore, we also included the combination of case 
particles plus wa as a secondary target of prediction. 
The case markers that can appear followed by wa are 
indicated by a check mark in the column "+wa" in 
Table 1. Thus there are seven secondary targets: niwa, 
karawa, towa, dewa, ewa, madewa, yoriwa. Therefore, 
we have in total 18 case particles to assign to phrases.  
2.2 Task definition 
The case prediction task we are solving is as follows. 
We are given a sentence as a list of bunsetsu together 
                                                        
2
 This set comprises the majority (92.5%) of the nominal parti-
cles, while conjunctive and focus particles account for only 
7.5% of the nominal particles in Kyoto Corpus.

from the Kyoto Corpus). Square brackets indicate bun-
setsu (phrase) boundaries, to be discussed below. Ar-
rows between phrases indicate dependency relations.  
1050
 with a dependency structure. For our monolingual 
experiments, we used the dependency structure annota-
tion in the Kyoto Corpus; for our bilingual experiments, 
we used automatically derived dependency structure 
(Quirk et al, 2005). Each bunsetsu (or simply phrase 
in this paper) is defined as consisting of one content 
word (or n-content words in the case of compounds 
with n-components) plus any number of function 
words (including particles, auxiliaries and affixes). 
Case markers are classified as function words, and 
there is at most one case marker per phrase.3 In testing, 
the case marker for each phrase is hidden; the task is to 
assign to each phrase one of the 18 case markers de-
fined above or NONE; NONE indicates that the phrase 
does not have a case marker.  
2.3 Related work 
Though the task of case marker prediction as formu-
lated in this paper is novel, similar tasks have been 
defined in the past. The semantic role labeling task 
mentioned in Section 1 is one example; the task of 
function tag assignment in English (e.g., Blaheta and 
Charniak, 2000) is another. These tasks are similar to 
the case prediction task in that they try to assign se-
mantic or function tags to a parsed structure. However, 
there is one major difference between these tasks and 
the current task: semantic role labels and function tags 
can for the most part be uniquely determined given the 
sentence and its parse structure; decisions about case 
markers, on the other hand, are highly ambiguous 
given the sentence structure alone, as mentioned in 
Section 1. This makes our task more ambiguous than 
the related tasks. As a concrete comparison, the two 
most frequent semantic role labels (ARG0 and ARG1) 
account for 60% of the labeled arguments in PropBank 
                                                        
3
 One exception is that no can appear after certain case markers; 
in such cases, we considered no to be the case for the phrase.  
4
 no is typically not considered as a case marker but rather as a 
conjunctive particle indicating adnominal relation; however, as
no can also be used to indicate the subject in a relative clause, 
we included it in our study.  
(Carreras and M?rquez, 2005), whereas our 2 most 
frequent case markers (no and wo) account for only 
43% of the case-marked phrases. We should also note 
that semantic role labels and function tags have been 
artificially defined in accordance with theoretical deci-
sions about what annotations should be useful for 
natural language understanding tasks; in contrast, the 
case markers are part of the surface sentence string and 
do not reflect any theoretical decisions. 
The task of case prediction in Japanese has previ-
ously focused on recovering implicit case relations, 
which result when noun phrases are relativized or 
topicalized (e.g., Baldwin, 2000; Kawahara et al, 
2004; Murata and Isahara, 2005). Their goal is differ-
ent form ours, as we aim to generate surface forms of 
case markers rather than recover deeper case relations 
for which surface case marker are often used as a 
proxy.  
In the context of sentence generation, Gamon et al 
(2002) used a decision tree to classify nouns into one 
of the four cases in German, as part of their sentence 
realization from a semantic representation, achieving 
high accuracy (87% to 93.5%). Again, this is a sub-
stantially easier task than ours, because there are only 
four classes and one of them (nominative) accounts for 
70% of all cases. Uchimoto et al (2002), which is the 
work most related to ours, propose a model of generat-
ing function words (not limited to case markers) from 
"keywords" or headwords of phrases in Japanese. The 
components of their model are based on n-gram lan-
guage models using the surface word strings and bun-
setsu dependency information, and the results they 
report are not comparable to ours, as they limit their 
test sentences to the ones consisting only of two or 
three content words. We will see in the next section 
that our models are also quite different from theirs as 
we employ a much richer set of features.  
3 Classifiers for case prediction  
We implemented two types of models for the task of 
case prediction: local models, which choose the case 
marker of each phrase independently of the case mark-
ers of other phrases, and joint models, which incorpo-
rate dependencies among the case markers of depend-
ents of the same head phrase. We describe the two 
types of models in turn.  
3.1 Local classifiers 
Following the standard practice in semantic role label-
ing, we divided the case prediction task into the tasks 
of identification and classification (Gildea and Juraf-
sky, 2002; Pradhan et al, 2004). In the identification 
task, we assign to each phrase one of two labels: HAS-
CASE, meaning that the phrase has a case marker, or 
NONE, meaning that it does not have a case. In the 
case markers grammatical functions (e.g.) +wa

Table 1. Case markers included in this study 
1051
 classification task, we assign one of the 18 case mark-
ers to each phrase that has been labeled with HASCASE 
by the identification model. 
We train a binary classifier for identification and a 
multi-class classifier (with 18 classes) for classification. 
We obtain a classifier for the complete task by chain-
ing the two classifiers. Let PID(c|b) and  PCLS(c|b) 
denote the probability of class c for bunsetsu b accord-
ing to the identification and classification models, re-
spectively. We define the probability distribution over 
classes of the complete model for case assignment as 
follows: 
 PCaseAssign(NONE |b) = PID(NONE |b)  
 PCaseAssign(l|b) = PID(HASCASE |b)* PCLS(l|b) 
Here, l denotes one of the 18 case markers. 
We employ this decomposition mainly for effi-
ciency in training: that is, the decomposition allows us 
to train the classification models on a subset of training 
examples consisting only of those phrases that have a 
case marker, following Toutanova et al (2005). 
Among various machine learning methods that can be 
used to train the classifiers, we chose log-linear models 
for both identification and classification tasks, as they 
produce probability distributions which allows chain-
ing of  the two component models and easy integra-
tion into an MT system. 
3.2 Joint classifiers 
Toutanova et al (2005) report a substantial improve-
ment in performance on the semantic role labeling task 
by building a joint classifier, which takes the labels of 
other phrases into account when classifying a given 
phrase. This is motivated by the fact that the argument 
structure is a joint structure, with strong dependencies 
among arguments. Since the case markers also reflect 
the argument structure to some extent, we implemented 
a joint classifier for the case prediction task as well.  
We applied the joint classifiers in the framework of 
N-best reranking (Collins, 2000), following Toutanova 
et al (2005). That is, we produced N-best (N=5 in our 
experiments) case assignment sequence candidates for 
a set of sister phrases using the local models, and 
trained a joint classifier that learns to choose the best 
candidate from the set of sisters. The oracle accuracy 
of the 5-best candidate list was 95.9% per phrase.   
4 Monolingual case prediction task 
In this section we describe our models trained and 
evaluated using the gold-standard dependency annota-
tions provided by the Kyoto Corpus. These annotations 
allow us to define a rich set of features exploring the 
syntactic structure. 
4.1 Features 
The basic local model features we used for the identi-
fication and classification models are listed in Table 2. 
They consist of features for a phrase, for its parent 
phrase and for their relations. Only one feature 
(GrandparentNounSubPos) currently refers to the 
grandparent of the phrase; all other features are be-
tween the phrase, its parent and its sibling nodes, and 
are a superset of the dependency-based features used 
by Hacioglu (2004) for the semantic labeling task. In 
addition to these basic features, we added 20 combined 
features, some of which are shown at the bottom of 
Table 2. 
For the joint model, we implemented only two 
types of features: sequence of non-NONE case markers 
for a set of sister phrases, and repetition of non-NONE 
case markers. These features are intended to capture 
regularities in the sequence of case markers of phrases 
that modify the same head phrase.  
All of these features are represented as binary fea-
tures: that is, when the value of a feature is not binary, 
we have treated the combination of the feature name 
plus the value as a unique feature. With a count cut-off 
of 2 (i.e., features must occur at least twice to be in the 
model), we have 724,264 features in the identification

 model, and 3,963,096 features in the classification 
model. The number of joint features in the joint model 
is 3,808. All models are trained using a Gaussian prior.  
4.2 Data and baselines 
We divided the Kyoto Corpus (version 3.0) into the 
following three sections:   
 Training: contains news articles of January 1, 3-11 
and editorial articles of January-August; 24,263 
sentences, 234,474 phrases.  
 Devtest: contains news articles of January 12-13 and 
editorial article of September. 4,833 sentences, 
47,580 phrases.  
 Test: contains news articles of January 14-17 and 
editorial articles of October-December. 9,287 sen-
tences, 89,982 phrases.  
The devtest set was used only for tuning model pa-
rameters and for performing error analysis.  
As no previous work exists on the task of predicting 
case markers on the Kyoto Corpus, it is important to 
establish a good baseline. The simplest baseline of 
always selecting the most frequent label (NONE) gives 
us an accuracy of 47.5% on the test set. Out of the 
non-NONE case markers, the most frequent is no, 
which occurs in 26.6% of all case-marked phrases.   
A more reasonable baseline is to use a language 
model to predict case. We trained and tested two lan-
guage models: the first model, called KCLM, is trained 
on the same data as our log-linear models (24,263 sen-
tences); the second model, called BigCLM, is trained 
on much more data from the same domain (826,373 
sentences), taking advantage of the fact that language 
models do not require dependency annotation for 
training. The language models were trained using the 
CMU language modeling toolkit with default parame-
ter settings (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997). 
We tested the language model baselines using the 
same task set-up as for our classifier: for each phrase, 
each of the 18 possible case markers and NONE is 
evaluated. The position for insertion of a case marker 
in each phrase is given according to our task set-up, i.e., 
at the end of a phrase preceding any punctuation. We 
choose the case assignment of the sequence of phrases 
in the sentence that maximizes the language model 
probability of the resulting sentence. We computed the 
most likely case assignment sequence using a dynamic 
programming algorithm.  
4.3 Results and discussion 
The results of running our models on case marker pre-
diction are shown in Table 3. The first three rows cor-
respond to the components of the local model: the 
identification task (Id, for all phrases), the classifica-
tion task (Cls, only for case-marked phrases) and the 
complete task (Both, for all phrases). The accuracy on 
the complete task using the local model is 83.9%; the 
joint model improves it to 84.3%.   
The improvement due to the joint model is small in 
absolute percentage points (0.4%), but is statistically 
significant according to a test for the difference of 
proportions (p< 0.05). The use of a joint classifier did 
not lead to as large an improvement over the local 
classifier as for the semantic role labeling task.  There 
are several reasons for that we can think of. First, we 
have only used a limited set of features for the joint 
model, i.e., case sequence and repetition features. A 
more extensive use of global features might lead to a 
larger improvement. Secondly, unlike the task of se-
mantic role labeling, where there are about 20 phrases 
that need to be labeled with respect to a predicate, 
about 50% of all phrases in the Kyoto Corpus do not 
have sister nodes. This means that these phrases cannot 
take advantage of the joint classifier using the current 
model formulation. Finally, case markers are much 
shallower than semantic role labels in the level of lin-
guistic analysis, and so are inherently subject to more 
variations, including missing arguments (so called zero 
pronouns) and repeated case markers corresponding to 
different semantic roles.  
From Table 3, it is clear that our models outperform 
the baseline model significantly. The language model 
trained on the same data has much lower performance 
(67.0% vs. 84.3%), which shows that our system is 
exploiting the training data much more efficiently by 
looking at the dependency and other syntactic features. 
An inspection of the 500 most highly weighted features 
also indicates that phrase dependency-based features 
are very useful for both identification and classification. 
Given much more data, though, the language model 
improves significantly to 78%, but our classifier still 
achieves a 29% error reduction over it. The differences 
between the language models and the log-linear models 
are statistically significant at level p < 0.01 according 
to a test for the difference of proportions. 
 Figure 2 plots the recall and precision for the fre-
quently occurring (>500) cases. We achieve good re-
sults on NONE and no, which are the least ambiguous 
decisions. Cases such as ni, wa, ga, and de are highly 
confusable with other markers as they indicate multiple 
grammatical relations, and the performance of our

 models on them is therefore limited. As expected, per-
formance (especially recall) on secondary targets 
(dewa, niwa) suffers greatly due to the ambiguity with 
their primary targets.  
5 Bilingual case prediction task: simulating 
case prediction in MT 
Incorporating a case prediction model into MT requires 
taking additional factors into consideration, compared 
to the monolingual task described above. On the one 
hand, we need to extend our model to handle the addi-
tional knowledge source, i.e., the source sentence. This 
can potentially provide very useful features to our 
model, which are not available in the monolingual task. 
On the other hand, since gold-standard dependency 
annotation is not available in the MT context, we must 
deal with the imperfections in structural annotations.  
In this section, we describe our case prediction 
models in the context of English-to-Japanese MT. In 
this setting, dependency information for the target 
language (Japanese) is available only through projec-
tion of a dependency structure from the source lan-
guage (English) in a tree-to-string-based statistical MT 
system (Quirk et al, 2005). We conducted experiments 
using the English source sentences and the reference 
translations in Japanese: that is, our task is to predict 
the case markers of the Japanese reference translations 
correctly using all other words in the reference sen-
tence, information from the source sentence through 
word alignment, and the Japanese dependency struc-
ture projected via an MT component. Ultimately, our 
goal is to improve the case marker assignment of a 
candidate translation using a case prediction model; the 
experiments described in this section on reference 
translations serve as an important preliminary step 
toward achieving that final goal. We will show in this 
section that even the automatically derived syntactic 
information is very useful in assigning case markers in 
the target language, and that utilizing the information 
from the source language also greatly contributes to 
reducing case marking errors.  
5.1 Data and task set-up 
The dataset we used is a collection of parallel Eng-
lish-Japanese sentences from a technical (computer) 
domain. We used 15,000 sentence pairs for training, 
5,000 for development, and 4,241 for testing.  
The parallel sentences were word-aligned using 
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), and submitted to a 
tree-to-string-based MT system (Quirk et al, 2005) 
which utilizes the dependency structure of the source 
language and projects dependency structure to the 
target language. Figure 3 shows an example of an 
aligned sentence pair: on the source (English) side, 
part-of-speech (POS) tags and word dependency 
structure are assigned (solid arcs). The alignments 
between English and Japanese words are indicated by 
the dotted lines. In order to create phrase-level de-
pendency structures like the ones utilized in the Kyoto 
Corpus monolingual task, we derived some additional 
information for the Japanese sentence in the following 
manner.  
 
Figure 3. Aligned English-Japanese sentence pair 
First, we tagged the sentence using an automatic 
tagger with a set of 19 POS tags. We used these POS 
tags to parse the words into phrases (bunsetsu): each 
bunsetsu consists of one content word plus any number 
of function words, where content and function words 
are defined via POS. We then constructed a 
phrase-level dependency structure using a breadth-first 
traversal of the word dependency structure projected 
from English. These phrase dependencies are indicated 
by bold arcs in Figure 3. The case markers to be pre-
dicted (wa and de in this case) are underlined.   
 The task of case marker prediction is the same as 
described in Section 2: to assign one of the 18 case 
markers described in Section 2 or NONE to each phrase. 
5.2 Baseline models 
We implemented the baseline models discussed in 
Section 4.2 for this domain as well. The most frequent

 case assignment is again NONE, which accounts for 
62.0% of the test set. The frequency of NONE is higher 
in this task than in the Kyoto Corpus, because our 
bunsetsu-parsing algorithm prefers to err on the side of 
making too many rather than too few phrases. This is 
because our final goal is to generate all case markers, 
and if we mistakenly joined two bunsetsu into one, our 
case assigner would be able to propose only one case 
marker for the resulting bunsetsu, which would be 
necessarily wrong if both bunsetsu had case markers. 
The most frequent case marker is again no, which oc-
curs in 29.4% of all case-marked phrases. As in the 
monolingual task, we trained two trigram language 
models: one was trained on the training set of our case 
prediction models (15,000 sentences); another was 
trained on a much larger set of 450,000 sentences from 
the same domain. The results of these baselines are 
discussed in Section 5.4. 
5.3 Log-linear models 
The models we built for this task are log-linear models 
as described in Section 3. In order to isolate the impact 
of information from the source language available for 
the case prediction task, we built two kinds of models: 
monolingual models, which do not use any information 
from the source English sentences, and bilingual mod-
els, which use information from the source. Both mod-
els are local models in the sense discussed in Section 3.  
Table 4 shows the features used in the monolingual 
and bilingual models, along with the examples (the 
value of the feature for the phrase [saabisu wa] in Fig-
ure 3); in addition to these, we also provided some 
feature combinations for both monolingual and bilin-
gual models. Many of the monolingual features (i.e., 
first 11 lines in Table 4) are also present in Table 2. 
Note that lexically based features are of greater impor-
tance for this task, as the dependency information 
available in this context is of much poorer quality than 
that provided by the Kyoto Corpus. In addition to the 
features in Table 2, we added a Direction feature (with 
values left and right), and an Alternative Parent feature. 
Alternative parents are all words which are the parents 
of any word in the phrase, according to the word-based 
dependency tree, with the constraint that case markers 
cannot be alternative parents. This feature captures the 
information that is potentially lost in the process of 
building a phrase dependency structure from word 
dependency information in the target language.  
The bottom half of Table 4 shows bilingual features. 
The features of the source sentence are obtained 
through word alignments. We create features from the 
source words aligned to the head of the phrase, to the 
head of the parent phrase, or to any alterative parents. 
If any word in the phrase is aligned to a preposition in 
the source language, our model can use the information 
as well. In addition to word- and POS-features for 
aligned source words, we also refer to the correspond-
ing dependency between the phrase and its parent 
phrase in the English source. If the head of the Japa-
nese phrase is aligned to a single source word s1, and 
the head of its parent phrase is aligned to a single 
source word s2, we extract the relationship between s1 
and s2, and define subcategorization, direction, distance, 
and number of siblings features, in order to capture the 
grammatical relation in the source, which is more reli-
able than in the projected target dependency structure.

 monolingual model performs significantly better, 
achieving a 30% error reduction (85.3% vs. 79.0%). 
Our monolingual model outperforms even the language 
model trained on 30 times more data (85.3% vs. 
83.6%), with an error reduction of 10%. The difference 
is statistically significant at level p < 0.01 according to 
a test for the difference of proportions. This means that 
even though the projected dependency information is 
not perfect, it is still useful for the case prediction task.  
When we add the bilingual features, the error rate of 
our model is cut almost in half: the bilingual model 
achieves an error reduction of 48% over the monolin-
gual model (92.3% vs. 85.3%, statistically significant 
at level p < 0.01). This result is very encouraging: it 
indicates that information from the source sentence can 
be exploited very effectively to improve the accuracy 
of case assignment. The usefulness of the source lan-
guage information is also obvious when we inspect 
which case markers had the largest gains in accuracy 
due to this information: the top three cases were kara 
(0.28 to 0.65, a 57% gain), dewa (0.44 to 0.65, a 32% 
gain) and to (0.64 to 0.85, a 24% gain), all of which 
have translations as English prepositions. Markers such 
as ga (subject marker, 0.68 to 0.74, a 8% gain) and wo 
(object marker, 0.83 to 0.86, a 3.5% gain), on the other 
hand, showed only a limited gain.  
6 Conclusion and future directions 
This paper described the task of predicting case mark-
ers in Japanese, and reported results in a monolingual 
and a bilingual settings. The results show that the mod-
els we proposed, which explore syntax-based features 
and features from the source language in the bilingual 
task, can effectively predict case markers.  
There are a number of extensions and next steps we 
can think of at this point, the most immediate and im-
portant one of which is to incorporate the proposed 
model in an end-to-end MT system to make improve-
ments in the output of MT. We would also like to per-
form a more extensive analysis of features and feature 
ablation experiments. Finally, we would also like to 
extend the proposed model to include languages with 
inflectional morphology and the prediction of gram-
matical elements in general.
