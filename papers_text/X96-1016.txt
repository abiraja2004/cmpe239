1. BACKGROUND 
Shrinking budgets, reduction in personnel and in- 
creasing performance expectations are facts of today's 
Government environment. The intelligence community 
has seen these trends tress its ability to collect, manage 
and disseminate information in an efficient, timely 
manner. The need to respond to rapidly changing state- 
ments of operational interest only exacerbates the prob- 
lem. It is no longer sufficient o monitor certain pre-de- 
fined individuals or interests. A proactive collection and 
indexing service must store virtually all types of in- 
formation to be prepared for any eventuality. 
The Advanced Data Extraction and Preparation 
via Tipster (ADEPT) Program \[Contract Number 
95-F147400-000\] is a TIPSTER II demonstration proj- 
ect aimed at alleviating problems currently being faced 
by the Office of Information Resources (OIR). OIR has 
been chartered to implement enterprise-wide systems 
to collect, archive, distribute, and manage information 
obtained from unclassified ata sources typically called 
"Open Sources." 
In support of its charter, OIR implemented ROSE, 
which provides afull range of information management 
tools that support document input, tagging, archiving, 
retrieval, and dissemination. The ROSE system is han- 
dling an increasing volume of data from disparate 
sources having widely varying formats. Acquisition of 
new sources or accommodation f format changes in 
existing sources can have considerable cost and effort 
impact on OIR operations, ince existing software and 
procedures often require modification. ADEPT will ad- 
dress the potentially high costs and delays incurred 
when adapting the current ROSE data preparation mod- 
ule to handle format changes and variations in new or 
existing sources in an automatic and systematic fashion 
improving the responsiveness and offering flexibility to 
OIR's user community. 
2. CAPABILITIES 
ADEPT was conceived as a vehicle for capabili- 
ties to alleviate problems currently being faced by OIR. 
ADEPT tags documents in a uniform fashion, using 
Standard Generalized Markup (SGML) according to 
OIR standards. ADEPT provides a friendly user inter- 
face enabling Data Administrators to easily extend the 
system to tag new document formats and resolve prob- 
lems with existing document formats. 
Data Processing and Extraction: ADEPT pro- 
cesses both well-formed and ill-formed ata; accepting 
raw documents and parsing them to identify source-de- 
pendent fields that delineate specific important in- 
formation. Some of these strings will be normalized. 
The field names, field values, and their normalized 
forms are stored as annotations along with the document 
in a TIPSTER compliant document manager. An 
SGML tag, defined by OIR, is associated with each an- 
notation. The SGML tags delineate predefined ocu- 
ment segments, such as title, publication date, main 
body text, etc. If ADEPT correctly captures all the 
fields for a documents format, an SGML-encoded oc- 
ument is transmitted to the ROSE System for informa- 
tion dissemination. 
Problem Detection and Diagnosis: ADEPT recog- 
nizes problems in the input documents and, offers deep 
diagnostics and suggestions to the Data Administrator 
for fixing those problems. Although new sources, for- 
mat changes and erroneous or ill-behaved data can 
cause processing errors, ADEPT identifies these prob- 
lem occurrences, generating diagnostics that describe 
the nature of the problem, such as where it occurred and 
why it did not match. From the diagnostics, the Data 
Administrator can easily determine whether the prob- 
lem is due to an error (anomaly) in the data or a change 
in format. 
Error Handling and Document Viewing: ADEPT 
maintains a problem queue and provides GUI windows 
to aid the Data Administrator with both evaluating the 
source of problems (data error or new/changed format) 
61 
and resolving them. The GUI enables aData Adminis- 
trator to see the original document, he output SGML 
template and the fields from which the SGML tags were 
generated. A Data Administrator can manually change 
the value of a tag and resubmit resolved ocument(s) for 
reprocessing by the system. 
System Adaptation: ADEPT enables Data Admin- 
istrators to manually adapt the system's configuration 
(mapping templates) to meet new or changed formats. 
Through a combination of menus, customized panels 
and, cutting and pasting operations, the Data Adminis- 
trator can specify the instructions to be used by ADEPT 
to parse and extract data from incoming documents. 
3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Figure 3-1 illustrates how ADEPT will be inserted 
into the Rich Open Source Environment Version 2 
(ROSE) testbed environment at OIR. After a success- 
fully evaluation, ADEPT may be made operational. 
ADEPT will be connected to the ROSE-Feed 
servers via a 16MB/second Token-Ring Local Area

Network (LAN). These servers receive streams of docu- 
ments from currently five sources/providers: NEXIS, 
DIALOG, DataTimes, FBIS and Newswire. Refer to 
Appendix A for a sample document example. After suc- 
cessfully parsing and extracting document required in- 
formation, ADEPT will transmit aSGML Tagged ocu- 
ment over a one-way fiber to the ROSE-Catcher where 
the information will be archived and disseminated to the 
OIR user community. Refer to Appendix B for a pro- 
cessed ocument example. 
ADEPT will have the ability process more than 
one thousand separate sources from the five current OIR 
providers, at an average of 80 megabytes and a maxi- 
mum of 150 megabytes per day currently. These figures 
are estimated to increase by twelve percent per month. 
Over an average month, ADEPT will operate seven days 
per week processing and expected 600,000 documents. 
Appendix C depicts the SGML tags which will be 
identified by ADEPT. 
4. SYSTEM DES IGN 
Figure 4-1 illustrates the design of ADEPT. 
ADEPT is comprised of eight processes; each perform- 
ing a specialized task. These processes are: the Docu- 
ment Input (DI), the Document Processor (DP), the 
Document Management (DM), the Management In- 
formation System Manager (MISM), the Problem 
Queue Manager (PQM), the System Adaptation Manag- 
er (SAM), the Administration Manager (AM), and the 
Output Manager Function (OM). 
4.1. Document Input (DI) 
The DI process is the interface between ADEPT 
and the ROSE-Feed servers. Based on the source, a 
mapping template is selected. The DI identifies and 
62 
!' 
Figure 4-1. ADEPT Document Parser 
separates the ROSE Feed stream into documents. The 
document and its relevant information is stored in local 
storage via the DM function calls. 
If the mapping template can not be identified, the 
stream probably came from a source unknown to 
ADEPT. Unknown sources are sent to the Problem 
Queue to for user intervention. 
4.2,  Document Processor (DP)  
The DP identifies and extracts all SGML tags de- 
fined in the mapping template for the specific source. 
Each identified field value is validated and normalized 
(if required) before being stored as annotations with the 
document via DM function calls. DP creates annota- 
tions with the value 'NA' (Not Available) for those non- 
required SGML tags not present in the document. 
If while processing, DP is unable to identify a re- 
quired SGML tag, validate or normalize its contents, the 
document is identified as a problem document. DP does 
not stop processing the document once encountering an 
error. It completes the document processing; identify- 
ing any remaining errors. For each problem SGML tag, 
DP generates diagnostic information. The diagnostic 
information contains an error explanation as well as 
suggested corrective actions. Problem documents are 
sent to the Problem Queue to await analysis. 
4.3. Document Manager (DM) 
The DM, the heart of ADEPT, is composed of a set 
of library routines providing a standard interface be- 
tween ADEPT and the collections of documents in per- 
sistent storage. The DM is TIPSTER compliant and uti- 
lizes Open Database Connective (ODBC) to store 
document and document relevant information in the Sy- 
base System 11 database. ODBC adds an additional lay- 
er of flexibility to DM. With ODBC, the Sybase System 
11 database can be substituted with any ODBC com- 
pliant database on any platform. 
4.4. Management Information systems 
Manager (M ISM)  
The MISM process manages the quantitative MIS 
Statistical data used to monitor and evaluate ADEPT. 
MISM records the document's name, source, date/time 
stamp, and other relevant information when a: 
? Document is received by ADEPT, 
? Document is successfully tagged, 
? Problem document is identified, and 
63 
? Document is transmitted toMain-ROSE Catcher. 
Additionally, ADEPT captures similar statistics on 
problem types and problems associated with each docu- 
ment. The ROSE Data Administrator can perform sim- 
ple queries and execute quick reports against he col- 
lected data. 
4.5. Problem Queue Manager (PQM) 
The PQM is responsible for managing the problem 
queue of ADEPT. The problem queue is a visual repre- 
sentation of all problem document information con- 
tained in the database. An entry exists for each problem 
document; it contains the document identifier, source, 
problem class, status, mapping template identifier, date/ 
time stamp, etc. 
At the ROSE Data Administrator's discretion, 
documents in the problem queue can be sorted and lim- 
ited by either source, date/time stamp, problem class, 
mapping template and status. 
To investigate/resolve a problem document, the 
desired ocument must be selected. For each document 
selected, the document viewer GUI is invoked. The 
GUI displays: 1) the original document, 2) the current 
version of the SGML template for that document, 3) the 
linkages between the two, 4) diagnostic information 
associated with the document, and 5) suggestions for 
fixing the problem tag(s). 
The document viewer allows one to modify prob- 
lem tags based on system supplied corrective actions. If 
system suggestions are rejected, tag values can be gen- 
erated from user supplied data. For cases where the 
original document trigger is garbled due to a transmis- 
sion error, the user can elect to define a temporary trig- 
ger. Notes can created and saved for each document. 
After the problems associated with a document are 
addressed, the document can be resubmitted to the sys- 
tem for reprocessing. PQM functions provide the user 
the ability to select and resubmit multiple documents. 
4.6. System Adaptation Manager (SAM) 
The SAM process provides the capability to 
create, modify, and associate mapping templates with a 
specific data source. A mapping template contains the 
directions on how to parse a specific data source. It 
specifies the SGML tags (i.e., Pubdate), whether the tag 
is required and any associated field names (triggers 
within a document) which must be used to extract he 
SGML tag value as well as corresponding format valida- 
tion and normalization rules. There is one primary map- 
ping template for each data source received by ADEPT. 
Once created, SAM allows the Data Administrator 
to test their mapping template changes against sample 
files of documents. 
4.7. Administrator Manager (AM) 
The AM manages the routine system administra- 
tion of ADEPT. AM provides login control and user per- 
missions, maintains the system's security and audit log, 
and enables backups/restores of the system databases. 
All user interaction (system adaptations and prob- 
lem queue manipulation) performed by the user are re- 
corded in the AM's audit log including a record of the 
change, user identification, and date/time stamp. Both 
the security and audit logs can be viewed via the AM 
GUI. 
From the AM GUI, the user can authorize others to 
print, display, search, consolidate, and delete the com- 
puter security audit log as well as add, delete or re-en- 
able accounts by changing user permissions. 
4.8. Output Manager (OM) 
The OM manages the output of successfully 
tagged ocuments for ADEPT. The OM's main capabil- 
ities include: 
? Creation of the SGML tagged version of the docu- 
ment, 
? Performing "Special Processing" (when required), 
? Providing an interface for passing the tagged ocu- 
ment o the Main-ROSE Catcher, 
? Providing a GUI which will allow the ROSE Data 
Administrator to view the original document, he 
final tagged ocument and the linkages between the 
two for any document stored in local storage. 
OM retrieves uccessfully processed ocuments. 
For each document, OM walks through the annotations 
(SGML tags) accessing their associated SGML tag val- 
ue. The set of SGML tags with their corresponding val- 
ue constitute the SGML template for that document. 
If the document is initially from the ROSE-Feed, 
OM will send the SGML Template, conforming specific 
protocol, to the Main-ROSE Catcher. Successfully pro- 
cessed sample documents are saved to a UNIX file for 
future review. 
5. SYSTEM PROCESSING 
Information is passed to each process via collec- 
tions stored within the TIPSTER compliant Document 
Manager (DM). Collections act as the queues for the 
processes. A collection contains the information eces- 
sary for a process to perform (i.e., documents and docu- 
ment relevant information). The DP, PQM, and OM 
processes each have a unique collection associated with 
it. A process begins by accessing the first document in 
64 
its collection. When completed, the document ismoved 
to another collection for the next process to continue. 
Since a document moves from collection to collection, 
each process only depends upon the documents in its 
collection. 
As depicted in Figure 5- I ,  there are two categories 
of collections: production and adaptation. ROSE-Feed

supplied documents are processed in the production 
collections. Adaptation testing as well as documents 
from sample files are processed in the adaptation collec- 
tions. These two categories of collections will clearly 
separate adaptation documents from production docu- 
ments. Documents in the production category will run 
at a higher priority than those in the adaptation category. 
Prioritizing enables ADEPT to process both categories 
of collections concurrently. 
6. STATUS 
The ADEPT project has completed the System Re- 
quirements Review (SRR) as well as the Preliminary 
Design Review (PDR). A Critical Design Review 
(CDR) is scheduled for late June 1996; to be followed by 
a TIPSTER Engineering Review. ADEPT will be 
installed in OIR's testbed environment in December 
1996 where it will undergo athree month evaluation pe- 
riod. After a successful evaluation, OIR will have the 
option to transition ADEPT to their production environ- 
ment.
