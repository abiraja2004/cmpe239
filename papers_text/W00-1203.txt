ABSTRACT 
In this paper, a knowledge extraction process 
was proposed to extract the knowledge for 
identifying Chinese organization ames. The 
knowledge extraction process utilizes the 
structure property, statistical property as well as 
partial inguistic knowledge of the organization 
names to extract new organizations from domain 
texts. The knowledge xtraction processes were 
experimented on large amount of texts retrieved 
from WWW. With high standard of threshold 
values, new organization names can be 
identified with very high precision. Therefore 
the knowledge extraction processes can be 
carried out automatically to self improve the 
performance in the future. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The occurrences of unknown words cause 
difficulties in natural language processing. The 
word set of a natural language is open-ended. 
There is no way of collecting every words of a 
language, since new words will be created for 
expressing new concepts, new inventions, 
newborn babies, new organizations. Therefore 
how to identify new words in a text will be the 
most challenging task for natural language 
processing. It is especially true for Chinese. 
Each Chinese morpheme (usually a single 
character) carries meanings and most arc 
polyscmous. New words are easily constructed 
by combining morphemes and their meanings 
are the semantic composition of morpheme 
components. However there are also 
semantically non-compositional compounds, 
such as proper names. In Chinese text, there is 
no blank to mark word boundaries and no 
inflectional markers nor capitalization markers 
to denote the syntactic or semantic types of new 
words. Hence the unknown word identification 
for Chinese became one of the most difficult and 
demanding research topic. 
There are many different types of 
unknown words and each has different morph- 
syntactic and morph-scmantic structures. In 
principle their syntactic and semantic ategories 
can be determined by their content and 
contextual information, but there arc many 
difficult problems have to be solved. First of 
all it is not possible to find a uniform 
representational schema and categorization 
algorithm to handle different types of 
unknown words due to their different morph- 
syntactic structures. Second, the clues for 
identifying different type of unknown words 
are also different. For instance, identification 
of names of Chinese people is very much 
relied on the surnames, which is a limited set 
of characters. The statistical methods are 
commonly used for identifying proper names 
(Chen & Lee 1996, Chang ct al. 1994, Sun et 
al. 1994). The identification of general 
compounds is more relied on the morphemes 
and the semantic relations between 
morphemes (Chcn & Chcn 2000). The third 
difficulty is the problems of ambiguities, 
such as structure ambiguities, syntactic 
ambiguities and semantic ambiguities. For 
instances, usually a morpheme 
character/word has multiple meaning and 
syntactic categories and may play the roles 
of common words or proper names. 
Therefore the ambiguity resolution became 
one of the major tasks. 
In this paper we focus our attention on 
the identification of the organization names. 
It is considered to be a hard task to identify 
organization names in comparing with the 
identification of other types of unknown 
words, because there are not much morph- 
syntactic and morph-sernantic clues to 
indicate an organization name. There is no 
significant preference on the selection of 
morphemes/characters and the semantic of 
the morphemes, which gives no clue leading 
toward the identification. For instance, '~ ,  
micro-soW (Microsoft) has the character by 
character (morpheme by morpheme) 
translation of 'slightly soR" and there is no 
marker, such as capitalization, to indicate 
that it is a proper name. The only reliable 
clue is its context information. However an 
organization's full names usually occur at its 
first mention, unless it is a well-known 
organization. A full name contains its proper 
15 
name and organization type, such as '~  
"~ , Acer Computer-Company'. The 
organization types became the major clue of 
identifying a new organization name. However 
abbreviated shorter names usually will be used, 
such as a) omit part of the organization type, for 
instances '~  ~,  Acer Computer', '~  
~..~J, Acer Company', b) omit the organization 
type totally, for instance '~ .~,  Acer', or c) the 
abbreviation, for instance '~ ,  global-electric 
(Acer-computer)'. Therefore the task became 
not only the identification of organization names 
in different forms but also finding their meaning 
equivalence classes. To achieve the above goal, 
the knowledge of 1) proper names of 
organizations, 2) different lines of the businesses, 
and 3) different organization types, should be 
equipped. Unfortunately there is no well- 
prepared knowledge sources containing the 
above information. Therefore a knowledge 
extraction model is proposed to extract the 
above mentioned knowledge from the dictionary 
and domain texts. 
2. STRUCTURES OF ORGANIZATION 
NAMES 
There is no rigid structure for an organization 
name as mentioned in the previous section. 
Roughly speaking an organization ame is 
composed by two major components. The first 
part is the proper name and the second part is the 
organization type. The second part contains the 
major key words lead toward the identification 
of an organization, since the organization types, 
such as '~ J ,  company', ~ '~"  foundation', 
"/J',~J~ group', '~ \ [ \ ]  enterprise' etc, tells what 
kind of organizations they are. If it is a company, 
to be more informative the line of business 
usually goes with the key word '~\ ]  company', 
for instances '~ff~.t..~J food company', ~  
~ computer company', ' ~ M  ~='~ ~ 
investment consultant company', but in most 
cases the keyword '~B\ ]  company' will be 
ignored, such as ~- -~(  President food). 
Sometimes the line of business and the 
organization type go together to become a single 
word, such as ,qa~ middle school',  ' f , l~  
bank' , '~ :  ~ hospital'. By observing the 
structure of the organization name, it seems that 
once a complete list of the organization types is 
well prepared, then it is not hard to identify the 
organizations by their Rill names. The only 
complication is that abbreviated names occur 
more frequently than fidl names. The identifier 
'.~..~\] company' is usually ignored in real text. 
The lines of business became the major 
identifier for a company and many business lines 
are common words, such as '~1~ food', 
'~JJ~ computer', 'TJ~0~ cement'. Therefore 
it is necessary to make the distinction 
between a common compounds and a 
company name, for examples, '~ J~J~n 
health food" vs. ,~m~ President food', 
'~ fg j~ personal computer' vs. ' ~  
~ Acer computer'. Although they are two- 
way ambiguous, usually they have only one 
preference r ading. 
In conclusion, the types and the proper 
names of organizations will be the major 
clues lead toward the identification of the 
organizations. In addition, it is also better to 
have a list of well known organization 
names, such that the well known company 
names, like '~.~i \ [  MicrosoR', can be 
identified immediately. Most of the 
knowledge preparation works should be 
done by oflline approaches. The prepared 
knowledge would be utilized to online 
identification of newly coined organiT~ations. 
The equivalent classes of the well-known 
organizations are also classified by a 
similarity-based approach. 
3. KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION 
There are two knowledge sources. One is the 
CKIP Chinese lexicon and another is the 
Chinese text from WWW. The lexicon 
provides a partial list of important 
organizations and the information extracted 
from them will be the initial knowledge of 
the identification system. The texts from 
WWW provide ample of new organization 
names implicitly. The problem is how to 
extract some, if not all, of them from the 
texts. Once we have a list of organization 
names. The proper names for organizations 
and the organization types will be extracted 
by analyzing the morphological structures of 
the organization names. However an 
effective morphological analyzer depends 
upon the availability of the knowledge of the 
organization types, but the lists of the 
organization types are not available yet. 
As we mentioned before the complete 
organization names have two parts. The first 
part is the proper name and the second part 
is the organization type. The number of 
different proper names is unlimited and on 
the other hand the number of different 
organization types is limited. Th/s property 
will be utilized to separate the variable parts, 
i.e. the proper name, and the constant parts, 
i.e. the organization type, from the 
organization names. 
16 
The numbers of organization names in the 
lexicon is very limited, since only the important 
organizations in the common domain will be 
collected. Therefore the initial knowledge 
extracted from lexicon is also very limited. To 
make the sources of knowledge more adequate, 
vast amount of new organization names hould 
be extracted from each different domain corpus. 
Unfortunately none of the existing corpora had 
tagged the organization names. Therefore we are 
going to design a semi-automatic method to 
extract the high frequency organization names 
from text corpora. 
The locality of occurrences of keywords in a 
text will be utilized for keyword extraction. 
Once an organization name occun-ing in a text it 
is very probably reoccurred in the same text. The 
recurrence property had been utilized to extract 
keywords or key-phrases from text (Chien 1999, 
Fung 1998, Smadja 1993). However not all 
keywords arc organization names. The 
knowledge extracted from the lexicon, i.e. the 
list of the organization types will be the initial 
knowledge for identifying organization names. 
In addition to the initial knowledge, the structure 
property of the organization names will be also 
utilized in classifying extracted keywords into 
organization names and non-organization names. 
The extraction processes will be repeated for 
extracting new organizations and therefore 
extracting new organization types. The more 
knowledge would have been extracted the more 
accurate of the organization identification will 
achieve. 
3.1 Morphological Analysis for Organization 
Names 
There are 1391 number of words in the CKIP  
lexicon classified as organizations. Table I 
shows some of the examples. 
Table I. The samples of organizations from the 
CKIP  dictionary 
As we observed, the morphological structure of 
an organization name usually is a compounding 
of a proper name and a organization type. The 
organization type might be a compounding of a 
line of business and a type, for instances i.~JJ~ 
~..~J (computer company), ~\]~,~(bank), qb~ 
(middle school), or simply a line of business, 
for instances AM(food), ~-~J~(computer), 
7~ ~ (cement). The proper names are 
variables, since each organization type may 
have many different institutions with 
different names. The types are constants. 
There is a limited number of constants 
attached with many different proper names 
to form different organization names. 
Therefore to extract the organization types is 
equivalent o extract the high frequency 
ending morphemes. Table 2 shows the top 20 
high frequency ending morphemes xtracted 
from the 1391 organization ames and in 
deed they are organization types.

3.2 Automatic Extraction of Organization 
Names 
A Web spider can extract ext from each 
different domain through WWW. Then 
keyword extraction technique is applied on 
domain texts to retrieve possible keywords. 
The kcyword set includes organization 
names, personal names, general compounds, 
and also error extraction. Most of which are 
not organization names. It is supposed that 
the available list of the organization types 
will be the source of knowledge to identify 
candidates oforganizations. However such a 
method only identifies the organizations of 
the known organization types and provides 
new proper names only. It will not identify 
new types of organizations. Therefore we 
use a new method to extract the organization 
names by using the structure property of 
organization names. 
Extraction Algorithm for Organization 
Types: 
Step 1. Using a Web spider to collect 
Chinese texts of a fixed domain, such as 
domain of finance and business, from 
.WWW. 
Step 2. Extract high frequency keywords in 
the text (Smadja 93, Chang & Su 97, Chien 
99). 
Step 3. For the keywords of length 3,4, and 5, 
each keyword is divided into two parts X 
and Y. X is a candidate of proper name and 
17 
Y is a candidate of organization type. The X is 
the initial two-characters of the keyword and Y 
is the remained characters. (Since most proper 
names of organizations have two characters, we 
can extract he organization types of the lengths 
1, 2 and 3 from three different groups of 
keywords with lengths 3, 4 and 5 respectively.) 
Extract the organization type Y, if for some 
keywords X+Y, the following conditions hold. 
a) X satisfies one of the following cases. 
1. X is not in the lexicon, i.e. X is an 
unknown word. 
2. X has the categories of Nb or No, i.e. it is 
a known proper name (bib) or a location 
name (No). 
b) For each Y, assumed to be the organization 
type, there must have more than n number of 
different X, such that X+Y in the extracted 
keyword list. In practice, the threshold value 
n was set to 2. 
In general, Chinese company names like most 
proper names are non-common word (unknown 
words). However sometimes they are place 
names (No), but rarely they are common ouns, 
adjectives, or verbs. Therefore in order to avoid 
too many false alarms, such as "~. ,~, /~ super 
computer", to be considered as a company name, 
the condition a) of step 3 is set. The reason to 
setup the condition b) is that each organization 
type Y should have many different organizations 
which have the same organization type Y, such 
as ' ~ ~  Acer computer',  '~,."~_,~ 
Leo computer', ' ~ ~ ~ ~ Blue-slcy 
computer', ...etc.. The real implementation 
shows the different hreshold value n gives the 
different precision and recall for identification. 
For the first iteration of knowledge 
extraction, we suggest to have higher ecall rate. 
Set the threshold value low and manually select 
the final list of the organization types. For the 
future automatic knowledge xtraction, in order 
to increase the precision of the information 
extraction higher threshold values are suggested. 
4. E~ERIME~ ~S~TS 
The knowledge xtraction processes for Chinese 
org~t ion  names are carried out by different 
stages. At the first stage, the words marked with 
semantic category of organization were accessed 
from the CKIP dictionary. There are 1391 word 
organization types. As mentioned in section 3.1, 
a pseudo morphological analysis process was 
carried out, which try to find the high frequency 
ending morphemes. Since the structure of an 
organization ame is a composition of X+Y, 
where X is a proper name and Y is a 
organization type. There are 546 different 
ending morphemes. The high frequency 
ending morphemes are exactly to be the 
morphemes for common organization types. 
Many of them are monosyllabic words and 
they are polysemous, as shown in Table 1. 
For the future identification, the 
disambiguation process has to be carried out 
for those polysemous ending morphemes 
(Chen & Chen 2000). The extracted 
morphemes and list of organizations will be 
the first collection of the organization types. 
At the second stage, we try to extract 
new organizations names from different 
domain text. Each different domain has 
many new organization types. For instance 
in the domain of finance and business, there 
are many company names, which have 
completely different word strings for the 
organization types as in the extracted list by 
the first stage. 
The algorithm shown in the section 3.2 
was carried out. At the step 1, 31787 texts of 
news of the finance and business domain 
were extracted from http://www.cnyes.com. 
At step 2, 40675 keywords were extracted 
from the news corpus. At step 3, 
organization ames were identified and the 
organization types were extracted. If the 
threshold value n -- 2, 92 types were 
extracted and among them 83 are correct 
organization types. The precision is 90%. If 
the threshold was set to 3, only 56 types 
were extracted and all of them happen to be 
correct. The precision increased to 100%, 
but of course the recall rate dropped. We 
don't know the exact recall rate, since there 
are too many keywords in the training set. 
However the recall rate is not important, 
since the whole knowledge extraction 
process is a recurrent process. The 
knowledge xtraction procedures should be 
repeatedly applied on the different set of text 
and at each iteration more information will 
be extracted. Hence the precision is much 
more important than the recall. The 
knowledge sources for future identification 
of organizations are the accumulated lists of 
the organization names, the proper names of 
organizations and the organization types. 
Table 3 contains the extracted 
organization types while the threshold value 
n=3. The organization types are classified by 
their lengths and sorted by their frequencies 
of uses. Table 4 contains the extracted 
organization types which associated with 
exactly two different names and the last line 
shows the error extractions. Among newly 
extracted organization types only 23 of them 
18 
are already in the old list.

4.1 Strategies for On-line Identification of 
Organization Names 
The knowledge about organizations extracted 
from the dictionaries and domain texts will be 
used to identify organization ames at on-line 
sentence processing. During the word 
segmentation process, an organization name is 
either identified immediately (if it is a known 
organization name), or it will be segmented into 
two segments of X+Y or several segments of 
(xl+x2+...+xn)+Y, where X is a proper names, 
Y is the organization type. When the proper 
name X is a new word, it will be segmented into 
shorter segments (xl+x2+...+xn). To simplify 
the experiment process, we  assume the proper 
names X are either the words of categories Nb  
(i.e. proper names) or Nc (i.e. the place names) 
or a two-character unknown word. For the 
identification experiment, a corpus extract from 
a T.V. news (http://www.ttv.com.tw) 
The patterns of X+Y in the testing corpus 
were searched. 117 different organizations were 
identified. Among thern 56 are known 
organizations, i.e. they are in the organization 
name list. 61 of them arc identified by the 
composition of X+Y and 52 of them are correct. 
It counts the precision of 52/61=85% for 
identifying new names. The total performance is 
the precision of 108/I 17=92%. 
The knowledge-based approach for 
identifying organization ames seems very 
promising. It outperforms the reports of the 
precision of 61.79% and the recall of 
54.50% in (Chen & Lee 1996) and the 
experiment was carried out under the 
condition that the knowledge extraction 
process is in its initial stage. We expect hat 
performance of the algorithm will become 
better and better while the knowledge 
extraction process continuously performs. 
4.2 Automatic Extraction of Name 
Equivalent Classes 
The abbreviated names are very frequently 
occurred in the real text especially in the 
domain of the stock market. By observing 
the abbreviation ames, the heuristic rules 
for abbreviating a company name can be 
concluded as follows. 
Abbreviation rule: If the proper name of a 
company is unique, then take the proper 
name as its abbreviation name, such as '~ ,  
Microsoft'. Otherwise the abbreviation will 
be a compound of key-characters from part 
of its proper name and part of its line of 
business, such as ~ is the abbreviation 
o f '~  m~l~,  China petroleum'. 
An  experiment was carried out to find 
the full names of the abbreviations of 
company names shown in the price table of 
the Taiwan stock market. The purposes of 
this experiment are a) to fred the equivalent 
classes of company names and b) to have 
some idea about the recall rate of the current 
knowledge extraction process. 
The matching process between the 
abbreviations and the extracted organization 
name lists is as follows. 
I. For each abbreviation name matches the 
organization names in the organization 
name list. Find all the organization names 
containing the abbreviation name. 
2. Rank the matched organization names 
according to the following criterion. 
The first rank: The proper name of  the 
organization ame is  exactly matched 
with the abbreviation name. 
The second rank: The abbreviation is 
compounding of key-characters f om part 
of the proper name and part of the line of 
business of the matched organization 
names. 
If there are many candidates with the 
same rank, then rank them according to 
their frequencies occurring in the training 
corpus. 
19 
There are 471 abbreviated company names in 
the price list of the stock market. 302 of them 
have matched candidates. Each abbreviation 
name may match many different organization 
names. The recall rate for the top ranked 
candidate is 282/471=60%. The precision of the 
first rank candidate is 282/302=93%. Table 5 
shows some of the results.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
The knowledge extraction process will be 
continuously carried on in the future. The 
accumulated knowledge will be utilized for the 
on-line unknown word identification as well as 
for the off-line knowledge extraction. The 
proposed knowledge extraction processing 
model can be generalized to extract other types 
of linguistics or morphological knowledge, for 
instances, to extract the transliterate foreign 
names, to extract the titles of people. 
Some of the errors are caused by that the 
titles of the people are wrongly identified as 
organization types, since the patterns of people's 
name followed by their title are commonly 
occurred in real text. These patterns are similar 
to the sU'uctures of organization ames. Such 
kind of errors can be avoid, if the titles of people 
are known and in fact the titles of people can be 
extracted by the same extraction model except 
that most of people's names have three 
characters instead of two. 
In the future, the knowledge xtraction 
processes will be automatically carried out. We 
expect hat it will be one of the major building 
blocks for automatic learning systems for 
Chinese morphology and sentence processing.
