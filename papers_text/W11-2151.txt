Abstract 
This paper describes the UPM system for 
translation task at the EMNLP 2011 workshop 
on statistical machine translation 
(http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/), and it has 
been used for both directions: Spanish-English 
and English-Spanish. This system is based on 
Moses with two new modules for pre and post 
processing the sentences. The main 
contribution is the method proposed (based on 
the similarity with the source language test set) 
for selecting the sentences for training the 
models and adjusting the weights. With 
system, we have obtained a 23.2 BLEU for 
Spanish-English and 21.7 BLEU for English-
Spanish. 
1 Introduction 
The Speech Technology Group of the Universidad 
Polit?cnica de Madrid has participated in the sixth 
workshop on statistical machine translation in the 
Spanish-English and English-Spanish translation 
task. 
Our submission is based on the state-of-the-art 
SMT toolkit Moses (Koehn, 2010) adding a pre-
processing and a post-processing module. The 
main contribution is a corpus selection method for 
training the translation models based on the 
similarity of each source corpus sentence with the 
language model of the source language test set. 
There are several related works on filtering the 
training corpus by using a similarity measure based 
on the alignment score or based on sentences 
length (Khadivi and Ney, 2005; Sanchis-Trilles et 
al, 2010). However, these techniques are focused 
on removing noisy data, i.e., their idea is to 
eliminate possible errors in the databases. 
The difference between these techniques and the 
method that we propose is that we do not search 
?bad? pairs of sentences, but we search those 
sentences in source training corpus that are more 
similar with the language model generated with the 
source test sentences and we select them for 
training. 
Other interesting technique of corpus selection 
is based on transductive learning (Ueffing, 2007). 
In this work, authors use of transductive semi-
supervised methods for the effective use of 
monolingual data from the source language in 
order to improve translation quality. 
The method proposed in this paper is also 
applied to the validation corpus. There are other 
works related to select development set (Hui, 
2010) that they combine different development sets 
in order to find the more similar one with test set. 
2 Overall description of the system  
The translation system used is based on Moses, 
the software released to support the translation task 
(http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/) at the EMNLP 
2011 workshop on statistical machine translation.

The phrase model has been trained following 
these steps (Figure 1): 
? Word alignment computation. GIZA++ (Och 
and Ney, 2003) is a statistical machine 
translation toolkit that is used to calculate the 
alignments between Spanish and English words 
in both direction (Spanish-English and English-
Spanish). To generate the translation model, the 
parameter ?alignment? was fixed to ?grow-
diag-final? (default value), and the parameter 
?reordering? was fixed to ?msd-bidirectional-
fe? as the best option, based on experiments on 
the development set. 
? Phrase extraction (Koehn et al2003). All phrase 
pairs that are consistent with the word 
alignment (grow-diag-final alignment in our 
case) are collected. To extract the phrases, the 
parameter ?max-phrase-length? was fixed to 
?7? (default value), based on experiments on 
the development set. 
? Phrase scoring. In this step, the translation 
probabilities are computed for all phrase pairs. 
Both translation probabilities are calculated: 
forward and backward. 
The Moses decoder is used for the translation 
process (Koehn, 2010). This program is a beam 
search decoder for phrase-based statistical machine 
translation models. In order to obtain a 3-gram 
language model, the SRI language modeling 
toolkit has been used (Stolcke, 2002). 
In addition, a pre-processing module was 
developed for adapting the format of the corpus 
before training (pre-processing of training, 
development and test corpora). And a post-
processing for ordering punctuations, recasing, etc. 
is also applied to Moses output. 
3 Corpora used in these experiments 
For the system development, we have only used 
the free corpora distributed in the EMNLP 2011 
translation task. 
In particular, we have considered the union of 
the Europarl corpus, the United Nations 
Organization (UNO) Corpus, the News 
Commentary Corpus and the test sets of 2000, 
2006, 2007 and 2008. 
For developing the system, we have developed 
and evaluated the system considering the union of 
2009 and 2010 test sets.  
All these files can be free downloaded from 
http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/.  
A pre-processing of these databases is necessary 
for adapting the original format to our system. 
We have not used the complete union of all 
corpora, but a corpus selection by filtering the 
union of the training set and also filtering the union 
of the development set. This selection will be 
explained in section 5. 
The main characteristics of the corpus are shown 
in Table 1: the previous corpora and the filtered 
corpora. 
 
Table 1: Main characteristics of the corpus 
4 Preparing the corpora  
In order to use the corpus described in section 3 
with the mentioned translation systems, it is 
necessary a pre-processing. This pre-processing, 
for training files, consists of: 
 
? UTF-8 to Windows format conversion, because 
our software adapted to Windows had several 
problems with the UTF-8 format: it does not 
know accent marks, ? letter, etc. 
? Deletion of blank lines and sentences that are 
comments (for instance: ?<CHAPTER ID=1>?) 
? Deletion of special characters (.,;:???!-/\, etc.), 
except those that are next to numbers (for 
instance: ?1.4?, ?2,000?, ?1/3?). We decided to 
remove these special characters to avoid 
including them in the translation model. During 
translation, these characters will be considered 
as phrase limits.

? Words were kept in their natural case, but the 
first letter of each sentence was lowercased, 
because first words of sentences are used to be 
lowercased as their most common form. 
? Contracted words were separated for training 
each word separately. For instance, ?it?s? 
becomes ?it is?. For the ambiguous cases, like 
?he?s? that can be ?he is? or ?he has?, we have 
not done any further processing: we have 
considered the most frequent situation. For the 
case of Saxon genitive, when proper names are 
used (instead of pronouns), ??s? is a Saxon 
genitive most of the times. But, when using a 
pronoun, it is a contracted word. 
For development and test sets, the same actions 
were carried out, but now, special characters were 
not deleted, but separated in tokens, i.e., a blank 
space was introduced between special characters 
and adjacent words. For instance, ?la bolsa de 
Praga , al principio del martes comercial , 
reaccion? inmediatamente a la ca?da del lunes 
cuando descendi? aproximadamente a un 6 %  .?  
So, special characters are considered as 
independent tokens in translation. The main idea 
was to force the system to consider special 
characters as phrase limits during the translation 
process. 
5 Selecting the training corpus 
Scattering of training data is a problem when 
integrating training material from different sources 
for developing a statistical system. In this case, we 
want to use a big training corpus joining all 
available corpora obtaining about 8 millions 
sentences. 
But an excessive amount of data can produce an 
important scattering that the statistical model 
cannot learn properly. 
The technique proposed by the Speech 
Technology Group at UPM in the translation task 
(Spanish-English and English-Spanish) consists of 
a filtering of the training data in order to obtain 
better results, without having memory problems. 
The first step is to compute a language model of 
the source language considering sentences to 
translate (sentences from the 2011 source test set).  
Secondly, the system computes the similarity of 
each source sentence in the training to the language 
model obtained in the first step. This similarity is 
computed with the following formula: 
 
)1()log(1
0
?
=
=
n
i
nPn
sim  
 
For example, if one sentence is ?A B C D? 
(where each letter is a word of the sentence): 
 
)2()(
4
1
BCDABCABA PPPPsim +++=
 
 
Each probability is extracted from the language 
model calculated in the first step. This similarity is 
the negative of the source sentence perplexity 
given the language model. 
With all the similarities, the mean and the 
standard deviation values are computed and used 
to define a threshold. For example, calculating the 
similarity of all sentences in our train corpus 
(about 8,000,000 of sentences) a similarity 
histogram is obtained (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Similarity histogram of Spanish-English 
system  
 
This histogram indicates the number of 
sentences inside each interval. There are 100 
different intervals: the minimum similarity is 
mapped into 0 and the maximum one into 100. 
Finally, source training sentences with a 
similarity lower than the threshold are eliminated 
from the training set (the corresponding target 
sentences are also removed).  
The whole process is shown in Figure 3. This 
process takes 20 hours approximately for filtering

more than 8 million sentences in an Intel core 2 
quad computer.

Figure 4: Translation results of baseline Spanish-
English system with different number of training 
sentences 
 
As can be observed, with more than 400,000 
sentences there is a 12% BLEU (with an 
asymptotic tendency), but there is an important 
improvement filtering up to 100,000 (there is 
already not scattering). But results start to fall off 
when there are insufficient sentences (problem of 
sparseness of data with less than 100,000 
sentences). 
6 Post processing 
After performing the statistical translation, we 
have incorporated a post-processing module with 
the following functions: 
 
? To check the date format, detecting possible 
order errors and correcting them. 
? To check the format of the numbers, numerical 
and ordinal ones: 1? into 1st and so on. 
? Detokenization and ordering the punctuations 
marks when there are several ones 
consecutively (i.e. ??.? or ?).?), trying to follow, 
always, the same order. 
? To put the first letter of the sentences in capital 
letters. 
? To use a backup dictionary for translating 
isolated words. This aspect has improved 2% 
(BLEU) but it has also introduced some errors. 
For example in the case of English-Spanish, 
there was a checking process for translating 
English words into Spanish. But there were 
several English words that also are Spanish 
words. For example, ?un? is an article in 
Spanish but in English means ?United Nations? 
(Naciones Unidas) so some ?un? were 
translated as ?Naciones Unidas? by error. 
7 Selecting the development corpus 
The development corpus is used to adapt the 
different weights used in the translation process for 
combining the different sources of information. 
Weight computation is a sensible task. In order to 
better adapt these weights, the development corpus 
is also filtered considering the same strategy 
commented in section 5. 
Our solution consists of using two different 
corpora (2009 and 2010 test sets) and ?choosing? 
the best sentences to use in development task with 
423
the same filtering technique explained in section 5. 
Finally, we select the 1,000 sentences with the 
greater similarity respect to the source language 
model of the test set. 
Other action carried out in final experiments is 
using different corpora for training translation and 
language models. In order to generate the language 
model it is better to use a big corpus; so, we use 
3,000,000 sentences that it is the biggest model 
that we can generate without memory problems. 
But in order to generate the translation model, 
the final one is trained with 150,000 sentences.  
The final results are shown in Table 2. 
 
Spanish-English BLEU BLEU cased 
Baseline 12.57 12.15 
Best result 23.20 21.90 
English-Spanish BLEU BLEU cased 
Baseline 10.73 10.30 
Best result 21.70 20.90 
 
Table 2: Final results of the translation system 
 
With this work, we have demonstrated that 
filtering the corpus for training the translation 
module, can improve the translation results. But 
there are still important problems that must be 
addressed like the high number of out of 
vocabulary words (OOVs) (more than 40% of the 
test corpus vocabulary) that they have to be 
improved in the selecting method. 
About the selection, it is important to comment 
that this method more likely filters long sentences 
out: the average number of words in the selected 
corpus is 14 while in the whole training set and in 
the test set is higher than 25. 
Other interesting aspect to comment is that in the 
selected training corpus, more than 70% of the 
sentences come from the Europarl or the News 
Commentary corpus, being the UNO corpus the 
biggest one. 
Anyway, although the improvement is 
interesting, the system can not compete with other 
well-known translation systems until we 
incorporate additional modules for reordering or n-
best post processing. 
8 Conclusions 
This paper has presented and described the UPM 
statistical machine translation system for Spanish-
English and English-Spanish. This system is based 
on Moses with pre-processing and post-processing 
modules. The main contribution has been the 
proposed method for selecting the sentences used 
for training and developing the system. This 
selection is based on the similarity with the source 
language test set. The results have been 23.2 
BLEU for Spanish into English and 21.7 for 
English into Spanish. 
9 Future work 
One of the main problems we have observed in the 
selection proposed method has been the high 
number of OOVs during translation. This problem 
has been addressed by incorporating a backup 
vocabulary in the post-processing module. This 
solution has solved some cases but it has not able 
to deal with order problems. Because of this, in the 
near future, we will try to improve the corpus 
selection method for reducing the number of 
OOVs.
