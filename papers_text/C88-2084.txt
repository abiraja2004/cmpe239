Lex ica l  t rans fer  is the point  of 
t rans i t ion  between an unchangeab le  
source text (a rook) and an in f in i te  
ar ray  of target  texts (a hard p lace to 
f ind an acceptab le  one). The author ' s  
Co l ing86 paper  (pp. 104-106) descr ibed  a 
new methodo logy  for test ing  lex ica l  
t rans fer  in mach ine  t rans lat ion.  This 
paper  reports  on the app l i ca t ion  of that 
methodo logy  to a test  of the DLT system 
and descr ibes  a synchron ized  b i l ingua l  
data base by-product .  Fur ther  use of 
the methodo logy  is encouraged.

I. DEF IN IT ION OF LEX ICAL  TRANSFER 
Al though the term lex ica l  t rans fer  
app l ies  most  d i rec t ly  to mach ine  
t rans la t ion  systems based on a 
l ingu is t i c  model  of analys is ,  t ransfer ,  
and generat ion ,  it can also be app l ied  
to systems in which there is no d i rect  
cor respondance  between source and target  
words (f~uch as in ter l ingua l  systems) by 
de f in ing  lex ieal  t rans fer  as the point  
in p rocess ing  where the target  lex ica l  
forms f i rst  appear.  It is the cruc ia l  
po int  aL which  all the in fo rmat ion  
ava i lab le  in the system must  be brought  
to bear  on the prob lem of choos ing  
lex ica l  forms. The eho iees  must be 
appropr ia te ,  or al l  the soph is t i ca t ion  
of the system in other  areas such as 
word order  and d i scourse  markers  wi l l  be 
of no avai l  in p roduc ing  acceptab le  
output.  
Lex ica l  t ransfer  must be based on 
the source text, wh ich  is genera l ly  a 
given. That is, one cannot  come back 
dur ing  the eva luat ion  of the output  and 
suggest  that the source text be changed 
to bet ter  match the target  text. Thus 
the source text can be compared  to a 
reck or to a text carved in stone. The 
target  text, on the other' hand, is 
supposed ly  somewhere  in an inf in i te  
co l lec t ion  of texts composed of members  
of an inf in i te  set of sentences  
generated  from a large f in i te set of 
lex ica l  items. Even if one could l ist 
in advance all the poss ib le  t rans la t ions  
for each word, which one cannot, the 
task is daunt ing.  Thus the space of all 
target  language texts is a hard p lace in 
which to f ind an appropr ia te  one. For 
those readers  not fami l ia r  with the 
say ing "between a rock and a hard place" 
on which the t i t le of this paper is 
based, I ment ion  that it refers to a 
d i f f i cu l t  s i tuat ion  in which all 
apparent  opt ions  present  problems.  Of 
course,  the t i t le twists the saying in 
several  ways. Its purpose  is both to 
emphas ize  the d i f f i cu l ty  of lexica\] 
t ransfer  and to i l lus t rate  it. The 
i l l us t ra t ion  is this: P lease t rans la te  
the t i t le  into some other language, 
bas ing it on an equ iva lent  target 
language saying ad jus ted  to descr ibe  
lex ica l  transfer.  It is novel 
s i tuat ions  that make \]exica\]  t ransfer  
t ru ly  d i f f i cu l t  to program for. 
2.  BACKGROUND 
At COLING86,  the author  p resented  a 
methodo logy  for test ing the \ ]exical  
t rans fer  mechan ism of a mach ine  
t rans la t ion  system. S ince then, the 
proposed  test has been per fo rmed on an 
ear ly  vers ion  of the DLT (D is t r ibuted 
Language Trans la t ion)  mach ine  
t rans la t ion  system. This  paper  wi l l  
descr ibe  the resul ts  of the test. In the 
course of per fo rming  the test, a 
b i l ingua l  data base of F rench and 
Eng l i sh  texts was produced.  This data 
base cons is ts  of pa i red  documents  with 
411 
synchron ized  paragraphs .  Th is  paper  
w i l l  a l so  descr ibe  the  data  base ,  wh ich  
has  been ed i ted  and  i s  now ava i lab le  to  
qua l i f ied  researchers  fo r  a smal l  fee .  
3 .  TUNING DISTORTION 
A good methodo logy  for test ing  
lexical  t rans fer  must  avo id  the trap of 
"tuning d is tor t ion" .  Tun ing d i s to r t ion  
refers to the mis lead ing  (d istorted)  
resul ts  obta ined  from a mach ine  
t rans la t ion  system when its d ic t ionar ies  
and a lgor i thms are ad jus ted  (tuned) to a 
par t i cu la r  text. A lmost  any mach ine  
t rans la t ion  system can produce  br i l l i an t  
resu l ts  when the same text is run 
through it again  and aga in  wi th 
success ive  tuning. The power  of tun ing 
is ~e\ ] l -known and has been g iven a name 
i n  A I  research ,  namely ,  de f in ing  a 
mierowor ld .  Cor respond ing  to  th i s  power  
i s  the  we l l -known d i f f i cu l ty  o f  
expand ing  a microwor ld  sys tem to  
funct ion  in te l l igent ly  in  a macrowor ld .  
In  a mach ine  t rans la t ion  sys tem,  
d i f f i cu l t ies  a r i se  when a tuned sys tem 
Js  app l ied  to  a new text .  
4. THE WORD L IST  APPROACH 
To avo id  tuning d i s to r t ion  in a test 
of lexieal  t ransfer ,  one can bu i ld  a 
d ic t ionary  from a word l ist w i thout  
knowing  what text wi l l  be supp l ied  
later, except  that it wi l l  cons is t  of 
words from the word list. This  approach  
has s ign i f i cant  advantages  over 
supp ly ing  an arb i t ra ry  text and 
upgrad ing  the d ic t ionar ies  to handle  the 
text, because  there is a consc ious  or 
unconsc ious  tuning of the d ic t ionary  
entr ies  dur ing  the upgrade  process  so 
long as the text is avai lab le .  
In the word l ist approach,  all  the 
words of the text are combined  with a 
number  of mis lead ing  words which  make it 
d i f f i cu l t  to tel l  what is the sub ject  
f ie ld of the text. Then the combined  
words are sor ted into a lphabet ica l  order  
and reduced to the i r  bas ic  forms. The 
a lphabet ic  word l ist is supp l ied  to the 
mach ine  t rans la t ion  d ic t ionary  updaters  
and the d ic t ionar ies  are s tab i l i zed.  
Then the text is p rov ided  and 
immediate ly  t rans la ted  w i thout  any 
updates  to the system and w i thout  any 
words miss ing  from the d ic t ionar ies .  
If one argues  that this method  
forces the d ic t ionary  updaters  to 
cons ider  too many poss ib le  co l locat ions  
of each word  in the list, one is s imply  
eompla in ing  about  the d i f f i cu l ty  of 
hand l ing  real text. At least this 
method  a l lows rea l i s t i c  tes t ing  of a 
system BEFORE its d ic t ionar ies  have 
reached full  size. If there is a 
p rob lem in the sys tem design,  it is 
bet ter  to f ind out wi th d ic t ionar ies  of 
one thousand words and all  their  
co l locat ions  than af ter  the d ic t ionar ies  
conta in  th i r ty  thousand words. 
5.  SOME RESULTS FROM THE DLT TEST 
The DLT mach ine  t rans la t ion  pro ject  
is a venture  of the BSO company in 
Utrecht .  The word l ist approach  was 
used to test its lex ica l  t rans fer  phase 
even before  the syntact i c  ana lys is  phase 
was complete.  This was done by manua l ly  
ana lyz ing  the test sentences.  The four 
test passages  inc luded over 2000 word 
tokens which  reduced  to about 600 
content  word types, to which  were added 
about 200 mis lead ing  words.  The word 
l ist  of about  800 words  was used to 
bu i ld  d ic t ionar ies  conta in ing  thousands  
of entr ies.  
A f ter  the texts were t rans la ted  by 
the DLT system from Eng l i sh  to French 
(dur ing the f i rst  quarter  of 1987), they 
were compared  with o f f i c ia l  vers ions  of 
the texts p repared  by pro fess iona l  human 
t rans la tors  at the CEC. This  compar i son  
revea led  that many  words matched the 
o f f i c ia l  language vers ions ,  some were 
acceptab le  synonymns  and, as expected,  
some words were t rans la ted  
inappropr ia te ly .  The DLT pro ject  is be 
congratu la ted  on the overa l l  success  of 
the exper iment .  The prob lem words to be 
d i scussed  in the paper  are not in tented 
to be s imply  a c r i t i c i sm of DL'r but 
rather  observat ions  that may be of 
in terest  to all  mach ine  t rans la t ion  
researchers .  Some inappropr ia te  
t rans la t ions  would  be eas i ly  cor rec ted  
by detect ing  pred ic tab le  co l locat ions .  
In the DLT test, the co l locat ion  
so f tware  was not operat iona l .  For 
example,  computer-assisted requ i res  a 
par t i cu la r  t rans la t ion  of assisted. 
Another  p rob lem is bring, which  can 
somet imes  be t rans la ted  as faire venir 
but which  is normal ly  t rans la ted  as 
prendre in the context  of the express ion  
bring x to y's consciousness. This 
requ i res  syntact i c  t rans fer  of a type 
the DLT pro ject  ca l ls  metatax is  and 
which  was not imp lemented  for the test. 
In a recent  issue of Language Monthly 
(December  1987, p. 7), it was repor ted  
that Peter  Lau, of the Eurot ra  project ,  
said, at the 1987 As l ib  conference,  that  
the real p rob lem of mach ine  t rans la t ion  
is not the " reduct ion  of s t ruc tura l  
d i f fe rences"  b~t rather  the 
"d i sambiguat ion  of lex ica l  entr ies" .  
The DLT test focussed  on such lex ica l  
t rans fer  problems.  
Some words  of in terest  f rom the test  
are: hardware, area, sheet, pratice, 
giving, perform, produce, schedule, 
concern, field, application, induced, 
lead, benefit, covers bachelor, courses 
duty, and form. 
412 
For each of the above words,  the DLT 
system produced  a t rans la t ion  which  was 
not appropr ia te  to the context .  These 
were not the only  mistakes,  but  on the 
other  hand, the DLT system t rans la ted  
the major i ty  of the words  (60 percent)  
aocept~bly ,  whi le  a fourth  (25 percent)  
were  prob lems for one reason or another,  
w i th  I|~ percent  in the gray area between 
aceept?~bil i ty and unacceptab i l i ty .  
The reader  is inv i ted to cons ider  
how these words  wou ld  be hand led  in his 
or her system, be it mach ine  
t rans l~t ion ,  content  analys is ,  or other  
natura l  language process ing  system. How 
wou ld  the proper  d i s t inc t ions  be made or 
an appropr ia te  t rans la t ion  for these 
words  be found w i thout  be ing tuned to a 
par t i cu la r  text or sub language?  
Not surpr i s ing ly ,  the word  hardware 
needs ~ spec ia l  t rans la t ion  when 
re fer r ing  to computer  hardware.  But in 
today'E~ techn ica l  documents ,  there can 
be re ference  to computers  but a lso to 
hardware  in a more genera l  sense or in 
re fe rence  to tools  or weapons.  How can 
the appropr ia te  se lec t ion  be made 
w i thout  an enormous wor ld  model  and a 
system which  t ru ly  unders tands  the text? 
(Shades of Bar -H i l le l )  Another  example  
is the word  area, which  can be 
t rans la ted  r~gion or pattie. However,  
these two opt ions are not 
in terchangeab le  and the d i s t inc t ion  is 
subt le  and not dependent  on pred ic tab le  
co l locat ions .  A sheet can be a drap (on 
a bed), a feuille (of paper) ,  or a lame, 
depend ing  on context .  Unfor tunate ly  for 
lexica\] t ransfer ,  the word  sheet wil l  
not a lways  be fo l lowed by a 
prepos i t iona l  phrase ind icat ing  the 
compos i t ion  of the sheet. 
A practice can be what  a medica l  
doctor  does when t reat ing  people,  what a 
mus ic ian  does to get ready for a 
concert ,  or what  is normal ly  done in 
some endeavor .  These three may be 
t rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .  
The verb  form giving can refer  to a 
t rans fer  of an ob ject  to someone or to a 
resu l t  ("one plus three gives four").  
To perform can refer  to one's  normal  
duty  or to a stage per fo rmance  and may 
be t rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .  L ikewise,  to 
produce can t rans la te  d i f fe rent ly ,  
depend ing  on whether  one is ta lk ing  
about  a p l i y  Or factory.  
The reader  can use a s tandard  
d ic t ionary  to see the d i f f i cu l t ies  in 
the fo l low ing  words: sohedule (t ime 
table or pr ice  l ist),  coneex~ ( interest  
or anx iety) ,  field ( l i tera l  area of 
ter ra in  or f igurat ive  f ie ld  of 
interest) ,  application ( t reatment  or 
level of effort), induced (social  or 
e lec t romagnet ic  pressure) ,  lead (a wire  
or a sales contact) ,  benefit (advantage 
or government  payment) ,  cover (l id or 
abst ract  l imit),  duty (ob l igat ion  or 
import  tax), and course (path or 
aoadmemic  class).  
Two of the words in the l ist involve 
an e lement  of poet ic  just ice.  Katz and 
Fodor d i s t ingu ished  the academic  degree 
and unmarr ied  man read ings  of bachelor 
with markers,  but d id not tel l  DLT how 
to d i s t ingu ish  between them when the 
word is encountered  in text. And the 
t rans la t ion  of form depends  on its 
(~ontent. 
6. THE BIL INGUAL DATA BASE 
Pre l iminary  to the DLT test, a 
corpus  of texts  was gathered  to ass is t  
in d ic t ionary  deve lopment .  A por t ion  of 
the corpus  was kept secret  and the test 
passages  were chosen from this port ion.  
A larger  por t ion  was made ava i lab le  to 
the DLT pro jec t  for lex ica l  studies.  
The Water loo  concordance  system was Used 
to generate  KWIC l i s t ings  for the 
lex icographers  to observe  the var ious 
uses of words in actua l  texts. 
The b i l ingua l  data base used in the 
test was der ived  from publ ic  domain  
documents  of the CEC and the Un i ted  
Nat ions,  to avo id  copyr ight  problems.  
It cons is ts  of twenty  documents ,  each 
with an Eng l i sh  and a French vers ion,  on 
sub jects  rang ing from migrant  workers  to 
the ESA space lab  to the automobi le  
indust ry  to agr icu l ture .  The documents  
were f i rst  scanned us ing a Kurzwei l  OCR 
device.  Then the d isk  f i les were hand-  
ed i ted into 400 smal l  synchron ized  
fi les, 200 Eng l i sh  and 200 French, 
represent ing  a total  of about  e ight  
megabytes  of data (i.e. over one mi l l i on  
words) .  As of this wr i t ing,  the small  
f i les are be ing fur ther  proofed  aga inst  
the or ig ina l  documents ,  and the 
paragraphs  or other  logica l  un i ts  of the 
texts are be ing  synchron ized  by ed i t ing  
in segment  number  marks.  These marks 
are used by a s imple preprocess ing  
program to produce  synchron ized  two- 
co lumn b i l ingua l  output  for indexing by 
WordCruncher ,  a new dynamic  concordance  
system which  has become ava i lab le  s ince 
the pro ject  began. This  two-co lumn 
format wi l l  fac i l i ta te  the study of al l  
occur rences  of words or express ions  with 
the other  language segment  automat ica l ly  
d i sp layed  to a l low the researcher  to 
qu ick ly  see how that word or express ion  
was t rans la ted  in the corpus.  
The ed i ted  corpus is ava i lab le  with 
permiss ion  of BSO for a modest  fee to 
qua l i f i ed  researchers .  It is hoped that 
the corpus,  the word  l ist methodo logy ,  
and the resu l ts  of the DLT test wi l l  be 
of use to others  in the machine 
t rans la t ion  community .
