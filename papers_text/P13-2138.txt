Abstract
The ever growing amount of web images
and their associated texts offers new op-
portunities for integrative models bridging
natural language processing and computer
vision. However, the potential benefits of
such data are yet to be fully realized due
to the complexity and noise in the align-
ment between image content and text. We
address this challenge with contributions
in two folds: first, we introduce the new
task of image caption generalization, for-
mulated as visually-guided sentence com-
pression, and present an efficient algo-
rithm based on dynamic beam search with
dependency-based constraints. Second,
we release a new large-scale corpus with
1 million image-caption pairs achieving
tighter content alignment between images
and text. Evaluation results show the in-
trinsic quality of the generalized captions
and the extrinsic utility of the new image-
text parallel corpus with respect to a con-
crete application of image caption transfer.
1 Introduction
The vast number of online images with accom-
panying text raises hope for drawing synergistic
connections between human language technolo-
gies and computer vision. However, subtleties and
complexity in the relationship between image con-
tent and text make exploiting paired visual-textual
data an open and interesting problem.
Some recent work has approached the prob-
lem of composing natural language descriptions
for images by using computer vision to retrieve
images with similar content and then transferring

pulled by a boat.?

of her reading lamp

text from the retrieved samples to the query im-
age (e.g. Farhadi et al (2010), Ordonez et al
(2011), Kuznetsova et al (2012)). Other work
(e.g. Feng and Lapata (2010a), Feng and Lapata
(2010b)) uses computer vision to bias summariza-
tion of text associated with images to produce de-
scriptions. All of these approaches rely on ex-
isting text that describes visual content, but many
times existing image descriptions contain signifi-
cant amounts of extraneous, non-visual, or other-
wise non-desirable content. The goal of this paper
is to develop techniques to automatically clean up
visually descriptive text to make it more directly
usable for applications exploiting the connection
between images and language.
As a concrete example, consider the first image
in Figure 1. This caption was written by the photo
owner and therefore contains information related
to the context of when and where the photo was
taken. Objects such as ?lamp?, ?door?, ?camera?
are not visually present in the photo. The second
image shows a similar but somewhat different is-
sue. Its caption describes visible objects such as
?bridge? and ?yard?, but ?Cabelas Driver? are
overly specific and not visually detectable. The

Table 1: Dependency-based Constraints
text of the third image, ?A house being pulled by a
boat?, pertains directly to the visual content of the
image, but is unlikely to be useful for tasks such as
caption transfer because the depiction is unusual.1
This phenomenon of information gap between the
visual content of the images and their correspond-
ing narratives has been studied closely by Dodge
et al (2012).
The content misalignment between images and
text limits the extent to which visual detectors
can learn meaningful mappings between images
and text. To tackle this challenge, we introduce
the new task of image caption generalization that
rewrites captions to be more visually relevant and
more readily applicable to other visually similar
images. Our end goal is to convert noisy image-
text pairs in the wild (Ordonez et al, 2011) into
pairs with tighter content alignment, resulting in
new simplified captions over 1 million images.
Evaluation results show both the intrinsic quality
of the generalized captions and the extrinsic util-
ity of the new image-text parallel corpus. The new
parallel corpus will be made publicly available.2
2 Sentence Generalization as Constraint
Optimization
Casting the generalization task as visually-guided
sentence compression with lightweight revisions,
we formulate a constraint optimization problem
that aims to maximize content selection and lo-
cal linguistic fluency while satisfying constraints
driven from dependency parse trees. Dependency-
based constraints guide the generalized caption
1Open domain computer vision remains to be an open
problem, and it would be difficult to reliably distinguish pic-
tures of subtle visual differences, e.g., pictures of ?a water
front house with a docked boat? from those of ?a floating
house pulled by a boat?.

to be grammatically valid (e.g., keeping articles
in place, preventing dangling modifiers) while re-
maining semantically compatible with respect to a
given image-text pair (e.g., preserving predicate-
argument relations). More formally, we maximize
the following objective function:
F (y;x) = ?(y;x, v) + ?(y;x)
subject to C(y;x, v)
where x = {xi} is the input caption (a sentence),
v is the accompanying image, y = {yi} is the
output sentence, ?(y;x, v) is the content selection
score, ?(y;x) is the linguistic fluency score, and
C(y;x, v) is the set of hard constraints. Let l(yi)
be the index of the word in x that is selected as the
i?th word in the output y so that xl(yi) = yi. Then,
we factorize ?(?) and ?(?) as:
?(y;x, v) =
?
i
?(yi, x, v) =
?
i
?(xl(yi), v)
?(y;x) =
?
i
?(yi, ..., yi?K)
=
?
i
?(xl(yi), ..., xl(yi?K))
where K is the size of local context.
Content Selection ? Visual Estimates:
The computer vision system used consists of 7404
visual classifiers for recognizing leaf level Word-
Net synsets (Fellbaum, 1998). Each classifier is
trained using labeled images from the ImageNet
dataset (Deng et al, 2009) ? an image database
of over 14 million hand labeled images orga-
nized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Image
similarity is represented using a Spatial Pyramid
Match Kernel (SPM) (Lazebnik et al, 2006) with
Locality-constrained Linear Coding (Wang et al,
2010) on shape based SIFT features (Lowe, 2004).

average (x-axis in (a)) and maximum (x-axis in

Models are linear SVMs followed by a sigmoid to
produce probability for each node.3
Content Selection ? Salient Topics:
We consider Tf.Idf driven scores to favor salient
topics, as those are more likely to generalize
across many different images. Additionally, we
assign a very low content selection score (??) for
proper nouns and numbers and a very high score
(larger then maximum idf or visual score) for the
2k most frequent words in our corpus.
Local Linguistic Fluency:
We model linguistic fluency with 3-gram condi-
tional probabilities:
?(xl(yi), xl(yi?1), xl(yi?2)) (1)
= p(xl(yi)|xl(yi?2), xl(yi?1))
We experiment with two different ngram statis-
tics, one extracted from the Google Web 1T cor-
pus (Brants and Franz., 2006), and the other com-
puted from the 1M image-caption corpus (Or-
donez et al, 2011).
Dependency-driven Constraints:
Table 1 defines the list of dependencies used
as constraints driven from the typed dependen-
cies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2009; de Marn-
effe et al, 2006). The direction of arrows indi-
cate the direction of inclusion requirements. For
example, dep(X ?? Y ), denotes that ?X? must
be included whenever ?Y ? is included. Similarly,
dep(X ?? Y ) denotes that ?X? and ?Y ? must
either be included together or eliminated together.
We determine the uni- or bi-directionality of these
constraints by manually examining a few example
sentences corresponding to each of these typed de-
pendencies. Note that some dependencies such as
det(??) would hold regardless of the particular

lexical items, while others, e.g., dobj(??) may
or may not be necessary depending on the context.
Those dependencies that we determine as largely
context dependent are marked with * in Table 1.
One could consider enforcing all dependency
constraints in Table 1 as hard constraints so that
the compressed sentence must not violate any of
those directed dependency constraints. Doing so
would lead to overly conservative compression
with least compression ratio however. Therefore,
we relax those that are largely context dependent
as soft constraints (marked in Table 1 with *) by
introducing a constant penalty term in the objec-
tive function. Alternatively, the dependency based
constraints can be learned statistically from the
training corpus of paired original and compressed
sentences. Since we do not have such in-domain
training data at this time, we leave this exploration
as future research.
Dynamic Programming with Dynamic Beam:
The constraint optimization we formulated corre-
sponds to an NP-hard problem. In our work, hard
constraints are based only on typed dependencies,
and we find that long range dependencies occur in-
frequently in actual image descriptions, as plotted
in Figure 2. With this insight, we opt for decoding
based on dynamic programming with dynamically
adjusted beam.4 Alternatively, one can find an ap-
proximate solution using Integer Linear Program-
ming (e.g., Clarke and Lapata (2006), Clarke and
Lapata (2007), Martins and Smith (2009)).
3 Evaluation
Since there is no existing benchmark data for im-
age caption generalization, we crowdsource evalu-
ation using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We
empirically compare the following options:
4The required beam size at each step depends on how
many words have dependency constraints involving any word
following the current one ? beam size is at most 2p, where p
is the max number of words dependent on any future words.

3.1 Intrinsic Evaluation: Forced Choice
Turkers are provided with an image and two cap-
tions (produced by different methods) and are
asked to select a better one, i.e., the most relevant
and plausible caption that contains the least extra-
neous information. Results are shown in Table 2.
We observe that VISUAL (full model with visually
guided content selection) performs the best, being
selected over SALIENCY (content-selection with-
out visual information) in 72.48% cases, and even
over the original image caption in 81.75% cases.
This forced-selection experiment between VI-
SUAL and ORIG demonstrates the degree of noise
prevalent in the image captions in the wild. Of
course, if compared against human-compressed
captions, the automatic captions are preferred
much less frequently ? in 19% of the cases. In
those 19% cases when automatic captions are pre-
ferred over human-compressed ones, it is some-
times that humans did not fully remove informa-
tion that is not visually present or verifiable, and
other times humans overly compressed. To ver-
ify the utility of dependency-based constraints,
we also compare two variations of VISUAL, with
and without dependency-based constraints. As ex-
pected, the algorithm with constraints is preferred
in the majority of cases.
3.2 Extrinsic Evaluation: Image-based
Caption Retrieval
We evaluate the usefulness of our new image-text
parallel corpus for automatic generation of image
descriptions. Here the task is to produce, for a
query image, a relevant description, i.e., a visu-
ally descriptive caption. Following Ordonez et al
(2011), we produce a caption for a query image
by finding top k most similar images within the
1M image-text corpus (Ordonez et al, 2011) and
then transferring their captions to the query im-
age. To compute evaluation measures, we take the
average scores of BLEU(1) and F-score (unigram-
based with respect to content-words) over k = 5
candidate captions.
Image similarity is computed using two global
(whole) image descriptors. The first is the GIST
feature (Oliva and Torralba, 2001), an image de-
scriptor related to perceptual characteristics of
scenes ? naturalness, roughness, openness, etc.
The second descriptor is also a global image de-
scriptor, computed by resizing the image into a
?tiny image? (Torralba et al, 2008), which is ef-
fective in matching the structure and overall color
of images. To find visually relevant images, we
compute the similarity of the query image to im-

Gold standard (human compressed) captions are
obtained using AMT for 1K images. The results
are shown in Table 3. Strict matching gives credit
only to identical words between the gold-standard
caption and the automatically produced caption.
However, words in the original caption of the
query image (and its compressed caption) do not
overlap exactly with words in the retrieved cap-
tions, even when they are semantically very close,
which makes it hard to see improvements even
when the captions of the new corpus are more gen-
eral and transferable over other images. Therefore,
we also report scores based on semantic matching,
which gives partial credits to word pairs based on
their lexical similarity.5 The best performing ap-
proach with semantic matching is VISUAL (with
LM = Image corpus), improving BLEU, Precision,
F-score substantially over those of ORIG, demon-
strating the extrinsic utility of our newly gener-
ated image-text parallel corpus in comparison to
the original database. Figure 3 shows an example
of caption transfer.
4 Related Work
Several recent studies presented approaches to
automatic caption generation for images (e.g.,
Farhadi et al (2010), Feng and Lapata (2010a),
Feng and Lapata (2010b), Yang et al (2011),
Kulkarni et al (2011), Li et al (2011), Kuznetsova
et al (2012)). The end goal of our work differs in
that we aim to revise original image captions into
5We take Wu-Palmer Similarity as similarity mea-
sure (Wu and Palmer, 1994). When computing BLEU with
semantic matching, we look for the match with the highest
similarity score among words that have not been matched be-
fore. Any word matched once (even with a partial credit) will
be removed from consideration when matching next words.
descriptions that are more general and align more
closely to the visual image content.
In comparison to prior work on sentence com-
pression, our approach falls somewhere between
unsupervised to distant-supervised approach (e.g.,
Turner and Charniak (2005), Filippova and Strube
(2008)) in that there is not an in-domain train-
ing corpus to learn generalization patterns directly.
Future work includes exploring more direct su-
pervision from human edited sample generaliza-
tion (e.g., Knight and Marcu (2000), McDonald
(2006)) Galley and McKeown (2007), Zhu et al
(2010)), and the inclusion of edits beyond dele-
tion, e.g., substitutions, as has been explored by
e.g., Cohn and Lapata (2008), Cordeiro et al
(2009), Napoles et al (2011).
5 Conclusion
We have introduced the task of image caption gen-
eralization as a means to reduce noise in the paral-
lel corpus of images and text. Intrinsic and extrin-
sic evaluations confirm that the captions in the re-
sulting corpus align better with the image contents
(are often preferred over the original captions by
people), and can be practically more useful with
respect to a concrete application.
