A machine translation system of English to Japanese is described, which has been used in 24- 
hour direct satellite broadcasting byNHK to translate "World News." 
In order to treat a wide scope of news sentences, the system is provided with more than I00,000 
lexical entries as well as about 3,000 grammatical rules which can robustly analyze various types of 
undefined words. It is also effective in translation of news sentences topreprocess proper nouns, to 
resolve structural mbiguities by weighting rammatical rules, and to select appropriate words using 
semantic markers. The operational experiments on machine translation i satellite broadcasting are 
briefly discusse~ 
1 Introduction 
Since December 1986, NHK, the Japan Broadcasting 
Corporation, has been conducting two-channel, direct 
satellite broadcasting using Japan's BS-2b broadcasting 
satellite. The two satellite channels now have 24-hour 
nationwide TV broadcasting services. The core of the 
services on Channel I is "World News," in which news 
from across the globe is broadcast. 
The languages poken in NHK's World News are 
English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Korean, and 
Chinese. Urgent and important news has simultaneous 
interpretation services. In usual cases, however, ser- 
vices only superimpose Japanese subtitles on the TV 
screen. Actually, more than 50 bilingual translators 
prepare amanuscript by transcribing and translating the 
original news. All the work must be done in a limited 
time, even at midnight due to the time difference be- 
tween Japan and other countries. 
A machine translation system was introduced to 
make easier this daily work. As a first step, the English 
World News has been experimentarily broadcast, about 5 
minutes a day, using the Japanese translation provided 
by the MT system. We think this is cultivating a new 
possibility of machine translation i Japan \[1\]. 
2 Satellite Broadcasting and Machine 
Translation 
Usually the generation of the subtitles proceeds as 
follows: 
1) a bilingual translator prepares a manuscript by 
transcribing and translating the original news; 
2) a supervisor examines the manuscript; and 
3) an operator inputs the final manuscript into the 
processing equipment. 
Our MT system was introduced in step 1, First of 
all, the original news is greatly summarized in English 
since the length of a subtitle script is at most 30 
Japanese characters per a display screen. Preediting is 
also carried out in this step to provide a better input for 
the MT system. After postediting, the final result is 
given to step 2. 
The system is based on the STAR machine transla- 
tion system \[2\], and works basically by a transfer 
method. The translation process can be divided into 4 
main steps: morphological nalysis, syntactic analysis, 
transfer, and generation. The morphological nalysis 
identifies words as well as locally fixed sequences of 
words. In the syntactic analysis, all the possible surface 
structures for an input sentence are derived, and then the 
best candidates are chosen by using the "weight mecha- 
nism" described below. 
At present, the size of the dictionary is about 
100,000 entries, and the grammar has about 3,000 
CFG-type rules. The system can translate a sentence 
having 11 words on average within 2 seconds using a 3 
MIPS UNIX computer. Further characteristics of the 
system are discussed below. 
3 Characteristics of the Machine 
Translation System for News Sentences 
3.1 Characteristics of News Sentences 
Examining alarge body of English news consisting 
of more than 3.5 million words from the World News 
and the basic news service of AP (Associated Press),we 
can summarize the linguistic properties of Ihe news sen- 
tences as follows: 
I) About 75,000 different words are used, and they are 
difficult o classify by news fields. 
3o8 1 
2) Various types of proper nouns such as human, nation 
and location names appear frequently. Human names 
are often with related words like titles. 
3) Many verbs having human subjects are used. 
Among others, "say," "call," "report," "talk," "ask," 
"think," "want," and "feel" ate often found. 
4) Many kinds of numeral expressions come out. Some 
of them are too complex to translate. 
51) Colloquial expressions appear frequently. 
3~2 Local Preprocessor  for Proper  Nouns 
In order to treat the above-mentioned characteristics 
1) and 2) of the news sentences, our MT system has a 
preprocess called "Local Context Translation"(LOC~I), 
which constitutes the second part of the morphological 
analysis. Its main role is to identify and translate vari- 
ou.~ types of locally fixed ~quences of words such as 
"U.S. President George Bush," 
"July 14th, 1789," 
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York," etc.

Trans la t ion .  
The LOCT can perform translation of human names 
with related words like titles, identification of undefined 
proper nouns, and selection of words. To analyze local 
patterns, the LOCT has a set of CFG-rules, different 
from the global analysis rules, as shown in Figure 1. 
By these rules, "President" can be translated if- 
ferently into Japanese depending on the previous word, 
R NAME picks up an undefined proper noun from the 
input text as a sequence of one capital letter and some 
small letters. 
3.3 Robust  P rocess ing  of  Undef ined  Words 
In addition to a large dictionary, our system has a 
powerful processor tor undefined words to cover a wide 
scope of news sentences. The processor estimates the 
lexical items of undefined words, and gives them to the 
syntactic analyzer. 
The main processing functions are: 
1) ~ t ~ ~ :  As explained 
in 3.2, the LOCT can estimate the grammatical 
values for undefined words by identifying local 
patterns. 
2) E~ i n h n in ,  form o f ~ :  Many 
English words have their own ending forms 
corresponding to grammatical values. For exmnple, 
a word ending with "4ion(s)," "-ly," or "+able" can 
be. estimated as a noun, an adverb, or an adjective, 
respectively. 
3) ~ :  The processor has some heuristic rules 
for a word starting with a capital etter, a short word, 
a sequence of numeral digits. 
3.4 S t ructura l  D isambignat ion  by 
Weight ing  Grammat ica l  Rules 
The syntactic ,analysis consists of two steps. 
1) All the possible surface structures for an input 
sentence are derived as an AND/OR graph \[3\]. 
2) The best candidates are extracted from this graph 
using our "weight mechanism," which can be 
formulated as a ~arch problem for an AND/OR 
graph having nodes with costs.

Figure 2 gives an AND/OR graph for a verb phrase: 
"(lie) is teaching the girl English grammar." where 
2 309 
italicized numerals how the weights of words given by 
the lexicon. The weight of the other node is calculated 
from those of the daughter nodes and the corresponding 
rule. For example, the weight of VP3-node is calcu- 
lated by using the second rule in Figure 2 as follows: 
2(aux)+3(vt2)+ 1.5*7(NP2)+4(NPS)+5+ 2 
= 26.5 
Among three VP candidates in this example, VP2 is 
chosen as the best one, since it has the smallest weight. 
The weight represents some kind of 
"incomprchensibility," "complexity," or" rareness" of a 
word, a phrase, or a sentence. All the words and rules in 
our system have been assigned their own weights. Our 
experiments on machine translation i  satellite broad- 
casting show that the best candidates arc chosen for 
about 78% of the successfully analyzed World News 
sentences. 
3.5 Word Selection by Semantic Markers 
Semantic markers are employed for Japanese word 
selection. Their effectiveness has been shown particu- 
larly in the areas mentioned below. 
1) Selection of a Japanese translation of 
"they" 
The word "they" quite often appears in news sen- 
tences. It has two major Japanese translafions:"karera" 
and "sorera" which refer to objects with will and objects 
without will, respectively. The confusion between the 
two intolerably degrades Japanese translation. 
A simple strategy that uses semantic markers and 
verb characteristics can make a proper selection in many 
cases without pronoun analysis. As mentioned in 3.1, 
verbs having human subjects are frequently utilized in 
news sentences. Meanwhile, verbs like "melt" take sub- 
ject nouns that have no will. If "karera" has a marker 
\[HIWILL\] (objects with high will) and "sorera" has 
nothing, translation control of "they" is realized by 
specifying the subject of a verb as \[HIWILL\] or noth- 
ing. 
2) Basic verb's translation word selection 
Verbs frequently used in news sentences are basic and 
thus have various meanings. To select a proper 
Japanese translation of a basic verb, we have set some 
special markers for news sentences. One of them is 
\[CRIMINAL\] which is utilized to obtain a special trmas- 
lation of "catch." Consider the sentence: 
"The police caught he assailant, who has a history 
of mental illness." 
The word "catch" was successfully translated as 
"taiho-suru (arres0," since "assailant" has the marker 
\[CRIMINAL\] and the translation description of "catch" 
defined its lapanese as "taiho-suru" when it took an ob- 
ject noun that belongs to \[CRIMINAL\]. 
4 Results,  Considerations, and Problems 
The following resuhs were obtained for 1,393 World 
News sentences which were input to our MT system 
during the three months of our trials. 
On a strict judgment, he number of successfuUy an- 
alyzed sentences was 898 (64.5%), of which 698 sen- 
tences (78%) were properly translated as first candidates 
by our weight mechanism. As far as these sentences 
were concerned, the mechanism was very effective. 
About 30% of the failure in analysis was due to errors 
in the input sentences such as misspelling or grammar 
mistakes. Colloquial expressions were alto difficult to 
analyze.

5 Concluding Remarks 
We described a practical machine translation system 
of English to Japanese which has been utilized in satel- 
lite broadcasting by NHK to translate the World News. 
Toward the second stage of application to broadcast- 
ing from April 1990, we are now trying to improve our 
system specifically in treatments ofnumeral expressions 
and colloquial expressions which have not yet been fully 
considered though they are major characteristics of news 
sentences. 
We also started a design of a French-Japanese ma- 
chine translation system based on a similar structure to 
our present English-Japanese ystem.
