ABSTRACT 
This paper presents a model for generating prosodically ap- 
propriate synthesized responses to database queries using 
Combinatory Categorial Grammar  (CCG - cf. \[22\]), a for- 
malism which easily integrates the notions of syntactic on- 
stituency, prosodic phrasing and information structure. The 
model determines accent locations within phrases on the ba- 
sis of contrastive sets derived from the discourse structure 
and a domain- independent  k owledge base. 
1. In t roduct ion  
Previous work in the area of intonation generation i - 
cludes an early study by Young and Fallside (\[26\]), and 
studies by Terken (\[24\]), Houghton, Isard and Pearson 
(cf. \[11, 12\]), Davis and Hirschberg (cf. \[4, 10\]), and 
Zacharski et ah (\[27\]). The present proposal differs 
from the earlier studies in the accent assignment rules, 
and in the representation f information structure and 
its relation to syntax and semantics. In the CCG frame- 
work, the information units that are delineated by in- 
tonation are directly represented, complete with seman- 
tic interpretations. These interpretations are utilized in 
making accent placement decisions on the basis of con- 
trastive properties rather than previous-mention heuris- 
tics: While such heuristics have proven quite effective 
in the earlier studies, we believe the model-theoretic ap- 
proach taken here will eventually lead to the develop- 
ment of similar heuristics for handling a wider range of 
examples involving contrastive stress. 
The remainder of the paper discusses the contrastive 
stress model, describes the implemented system, and 
presents results demonstrating the system's ability to 
generate a variety of intonational possibilities for a given

sentence depending on the discourse context. 
2. Mot ivat ion  
Meaning-to-speech systems differ from text-to-speech 
systems in the manner in which semantic and pragmatic 
information is exploited for assigning intonational fea- 
tures. Text-to-speech systems for unrestricted text are 
forced to rely on crude syntactic analyses and word clas- 
sifications in making judgements about he accentability 
of words in an utterance, often using the strategy of pre- 
vious mention whereby a word is de-accented if it (or 
perhaps its root) has previously occurred in some re- 
stricted segment of the text (cf. \[10\], \[15\]). The text can 
be divided into such meaningful discourse segments on 
the basis of cue phrases and paragraph boundaries. 
Meaning-to-speech systems, on the other hand, have 
been employed in applications with limited, well-defined 
domains where semantic and discourse level knowledge 
is available. For these systems, the effectiveness of the 
previous mention strategy can be improved by consid- 
ering semantic givenness in addition to lexical givenness 
when deciding if a word should be de-accented. 
Such enhanced previous-mention heuristics, while prov- 
ing quite effective in practice, have exhibited several defi- 
ciencies that have been noted by their proponents. Fore- 
most among these is the inability of such strategies to 
model the seemingly contrastive nature of many accen- 
tual patterns in spoken language (\[10\]). In some cases, 
contrastive stress errors may sound unnatural and in the 
worst case may actually mislead the hearer. Another 
problem that has been attributed to previous-mention 
strategies i the tendency to include too many accents 
(\[15\]), potentially resulting in an inability for the hearer 
to determine the most important aspects of the speaker's 
intended message. The remainder of this section ad- 
dresses these two problems and proposes explicitly mod- 
eling contrast in meaning-to-speech systems as a poten- 
tial solution. 
A previous-mention strategy might work as follows: 
193 
? Assign accents to open-class items (e.g. nouns, 
verbs, other content words) 
? Do not assign accents to closed-class items (e.g. 
function words) 
? De-accent any words that were already mentioned 
in the local discourse segment. 
Now consider a hypothetical pplication in a medical do- 
main that produces the type of output shown in (1) when 
a physician fails to include a recommended procedure in 
a plan for treating a specific patient. 1
(1) a. You seem to have neglected to consider a WHO- 
RACOSTOMY procedure for this patient. 
b. I propose doing a LEFT thoracostomy. 
Using a previous-mention algorithm like the one above 
will produce the appropriate accentual pattern on the 
NP a left thoracostomy in (1)b because thoracoslomy is
explicit\]y mentioned in the previous entence. 
Now suppose the physician inadvertently includes the 
wrong procedure in the treatment plan, say a left ~hora- 
cotomy rather than the intended left thoracostomy. Ex- 
ample (2) shows the possible output from the system. 
(2) a. You seem to have confused the THORACOTOMY 
and THORACOSTOMY procedures in your plan 
for this patient. 
b. I propose doing a'left THORACOSTOMY. 
b ~. I propose doing a LEFT THORACOSTOMY. 
b ' .  I propose doing a LEFT thoracostomy. 
b ~". I propose doing a left thoracostomy. 
The four accentual possibilities for the NP a left ?ho- 
racos?omy in the second sentence are given in (2)b-b m. 
Examples (2)b and b ~ are both acceptable because they 
correctly accent the contrastive thoracostomy. Based 
on the the contents of the first sentence, however, the 
previous-mention strategy would produce the accentual 
pattern illustrated in (2)b", which is clearly inappropri- 
ate. In fact, such an intonation may cause the hearer 
to infer that the program's objection was to perform- 
ing the procedure on the wrong side. Finally, if one 
considers the terms left and thoracos?omy to be given 
1 The  examples  used throughout  he paper  are based on a the 
domain  of TraurnAID,  which is current ly  under  development  at 
the Univers i ty of Pennsy lvan ia  (\[25\]). The  morb id  nature  of the 
examples,  for which we apologize, is due entirely to the special 
nature  of the  t rauma domain .  The  lay reader  may be interested to 
know that  a thoracos?omy is the insert ion of a tube into the chest, 
and a thoracotomy is a surgical  incision of the chest wall. In the 
examples,  accented words are shown in smal l  capitals.  
prior to the utterance because of their inclusion in the 
physician's plan, the previous-mention strategy would 
attempt o de-accent both terms as in (2)b~% Since the 
NP clearly requires ome form of accentuation, alterna- 
tive strategies are necessary in such a case. Other plausi- 
ble previous-mention strategies exhibit similar problems 
for equally simple examples. 
We believe that some of the problems associated with the 
previot/s-mention strategy in meaning-to-speech systems 
can be rectified by explicitly modeling contrastive stress. 
For the esample above, the program initially knows that 
the physician's plan includes a left thoracotomy and that 
the program's plan includes a left thoracostomy. Hence, 
the program can construct an explicit set of alternative 
procedures from which accentual patterns can be deter- 
mined. By noting that the alternatives differ not in the 
side on which they are to be performed, but in the ac- 
tual type of procedure, the program can easily decide to 
stress thoracostomy rather than left. The precise algo- 
rithm for contrastive stress assignment is given a more 
detailed explanation in \[18\]. 
We shall also see how the contrastive stress approach 
can avoid the over-accentuation problem of the previous- 
mention strategy as well. Consider a patient with two 
chest wounds: a right lateral wound and a right anterior 
wound. At some point our hypothetical system may need 
to address one of these wounds in the following manner. 2 
(3) You need to address the right lateral chest wound 
in your treatment plan. 
Using the previous-mention strategy would lead to the 
following output if the wound had not been mentioned 
previously. 
(4) You need to address the RIGHT LATERAL CHEST 
WOUND in your treatment plan. 
The contrastive stress algorithm is able to recognize the 
crucial distinction between the lateral and anterior prop- 
erties of the patient's two wounds and assign stress ac- 
cordingly, producing: 
(5) You need to address the right LATERAL chest 
wound in your treatment plan. 
3. The Implementat ion  
The present paper describes an implemented system 
(IBIS) that applies the CCG theory of prosody outlined

in \[22, 17, 18\] to the the task of specifying contextually 
appropriate intonation for spoken messages concerning 
the medical expert system TraumAID, developed inde- 
pendently at Penn (cf. \[25\]). Our examples below are 
taker/from this domain, in which it is eventually our in- 
tention to deploy the generation system in a surgical sit- 
uation in a critiquing mode, as an output device for the 
expert system. For the present purpose of illustrating 
the workings of the generation system, we have chosen 
a simpler (but sociologically rather unrealistic) database 
query application. 
The architecture ofthe system (shown in Figure 1) iden- 
tifies the key modules of the system, their relationships 
to the database and the underlying rammar, and the 
dependencies among their inputs and outputs. The pro- 
cess begins with a fully segmented and prosodically an- 
notated representation f a spoken query, as shown in 
example (6). 3 
(6) I know what the CAT scan is for, 
but (WHICH condition) (does URINALYSIS address?) 
L+H* LH% H* LL$ 
In example (6), capitals indicate stress and brackets in- 
formally indicate the intonational phrasing. The intona- 
tion contour is indicated more formally using a version of 
Pierrehumbert's notation (\[2\]). In this notation, L+H* 
and H* are different high pitch accents. LH% (and its 
relative LH$) and L (and its relatives LL% and LL$) are 
rising and low boundaries respectively. The difference 
between members of sets like L, LL% and LL$ bound- 
aries embodies Pierrehumbert and Beckman's (\[2\]) dis- 
tinction between intermediate phrase boundaries, into- 
national phrase boundaries, and utterance boundaries. 
3We stress that we do not start with a speech wave, but a rep- 
resentation that one might obtain from a hypothetical system that 
translates uch a wave into strings of words with Pierrehumbert- 
style intonation markings. 
Since utterance boundaries always coincide with an in- 
tonational phrase boundary, this distinction is often left 
implicit in the literature, both being written with % 
boundaries. For purposes of synthesis, however, the dis- 
tinction is important since utterance boundaries must 
be accompanied by a greater degree of lengthening and 
pausing. 
The intonational tunes L+H* LH(%/$) and H* L(L%/$) 
shown in example (6) convey two distinct kinds of dis- 
course information. First, both H* and L+H* pitch ac- 
cents mark the word that they occur on (or rather, some 
element of its interpretation) for focus ,  which in this task 
implies contrast of some kind. Second, the tunes as a 
whole mark the constituent that bears them (or rather, 
its interpretation) ashaving a particular function in the 
discourse. We have argued at length elsewhere that, at 
least in this restricted class of dialogues, the function of 
the L+H* LH% and L+H* LH$ tunes is to mark the 
theme - that is, "what the participants have agreed to 
talk about". The H* L(L%/$) tune marks the theme - 
that is, "what the speaker has to say" about the theme. 
We employ asimple bottom-up shift-reduce parser, mak- 
ir/g direct use of the combinatory prosody theory de- 
scribed in \[22, 17, 18\], to identify the semantics of the 
question. The inclusion of prosodic categories in the 
grammar allows the parser to identify the information 
structure within the question as well, dividing it into 
theme and theme, and marking focused items with * 
as shown in (7). For the moment, unmarked themes 
are handled by taking the longest unmarked constituent 
permitted by the syntax. 
(7) Proposition: 
s : A~.\[eondition(x)&address(*urlnalysis,x)\] 
Theme: 
s :~.\[(eondition(x)&address(*urirtalysis,x))\] 
(s : address(*urinalysis,a:)\]np: x)\]
Rheme: 
s : address(*urinalysis,x)/np :~ 
The content generation module, which has the task of 
determining the semantics and information structure of 
the response, relies on several simplifying assumptions. 
Foremost among these is the notion that the rheme of the 
question is the sole determinant of the theme of the re- 
sponse, including the specification offocus (although the 
type of pitch accent hat eventually marks the focus will 
be different in the response). The overall semantic struc- 
ture of the response can be determined by instantiating 
the variable in the lambda expression corresponding to
the wh-question with a simple Prolog query. Given the 
syntactic and focus-marked semantic representation for 
the response, along with the syntactic and focus-marked 
semantic representation forthe theme of the response, a
representation forthe rheme of the response can worked 
195 
out from the grammar rules. The assignment offocus for 
the rheme of the response (i.e. the instantiated variable) 
must be worked out from scratch, using techniques for 
assigning contrastive stress. 
The algorithm for assigning contrastive stress works as 
follows. For a given object x in the theme of the re- 
sponse, we associate a set of properties which are essen- 
tial for constructing an expression that uniquely refers 
to x, as well as a set of objects (and their referring prop- 
erties) 'which might be considered alternatives to z with 
respect o the database under consideration. The set of 
alternal;ives i  initially restricted by properties or objects 
explicitly mentioned in the theme of the question. For 
each property of x in turn, we restrict the set of alter- 
natives to include only those objects having the given 
property. When imposing the restriction decreases the 
number of alternatives, we conclude that the given prop- 
erty serves to distinguish x from its alternatives, uggest- 
ing that the corresponding linguistic material should be 
stressed. 
For example, for the question given in (6), the content 
generator produces the following representation, because 
the theme is "What urinalysis addresses", the rheme is 
"hematuria", and the context includes alternative con- 
ditions and treatments: 
(8) Proposition: 
Theme: 
Rheme: 
s : addre88(*ur ina lys i s ,  *hernatur ia )  
8 : address (*ur ina lys i s ,x ) /np  : x 
np : *hernatur ia  
From the output of the content generator, the ccG 
generation module produces a string of words and 
Pierrehumbert-stylemarkings representing the response, 
as shown in (9). 4 
(9) urinalysis~lhstar ddresses~lhb ematuria@hstarllb 
The final aspect of generation i volves translating such a 
string into a form usable by a suitable speech synthesizer. 
The current implementation uses the Bell Laboratories 
TTS system \[14\] as a post-processor to synthesize the 
speech wave. 
4. Resul ts  
The IBIS system produces distinct intonational differ- 
ences in minimal pairs of queries like those in examples 
(10)-(13) below. These minimal pairs illustrate the sys- 
tem's capability for producing appropriately different in- 
tonation contours for a single string of words under the 
control of discourse context. If the responses in these

examples are interchanged, the results sound distinctly 
unnatural in the given contexts.

but which medications prevent INFECTION?

Examples (10) and (11) illustrate the necessity of the 
theme/theme distinction. Although the pitch accent lo- 
cations in the responses in these examples are identical, 
occurring on lacerations and bleeding, the alternation in 
the theme and theme tunes is necessary to convey the in- 
tended propositions in the given contexts. Examples (12) 
and (13) show that the system makes appropriate dis- 
tinctions in focus placement within themes and themes 
based on context. More complex examples, like those 
shown in (14)-(16), illustrate the usefulness of the con- 
trastive stress algorithm for assigning pitch accents in 
appropriate locations. 5 
5. Conclus ions 
While previous attempts at intonation generation have 
relied on previous-mention heuristics for assigning ac- 
cents, the present results show that is is possible to gen- 
erate synthesized spoken responses with appropriate in- 
tonational contours in a database query task using ex- 
plicit representations of contrastive stress. Many im- 
portant problems remain, both because of the limited 
range of discourse-types and intonational tunes consid- 
ered here, and because of the extreme oversimplification 
of the discourse model (particularly with respect o the

ontology, or variety of types of discourse ntities). Nev- 
ertheless, the system presented here has a number of 
properties that we believe augur well for its extension to 
richer varieties of discourse, including the types of mono- 
logues and commentaries that are more appropriate for 
the actual TraumAID domain. Foremost among these is 
the fact that the system and the underlying theory are 
entirely modular. That is, any of its components can be 
replaced without affecting any other component because 
each is entirely independent of the particular grammar 
defined by the lexicon and the particular knowledge base 
that the discourse concerns. It is only because CCG al- 
lows us to unify the structures implicated in syntax and 
semantics on the one hand, and intonation and discourse 
information on the other, that this modular structure 
can be so simply attained.
