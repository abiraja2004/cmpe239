Abstract 
We propose a gold standard for evaluating two 
types of information extraction output -- noun 
phrase (NP) chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and 
Marcus 1995) and technical terms (Justeson and 
Katz 1995; Daille 2000; Jacquemin 2002). The 
gold standard is built around the notion that since 
different semantic and syntactic variants of terms 
are arguably correct, a fully satisfactory assess-
ment of the quality of the output must include 
task-based evaluation. We conducted an experi-
ment that assessed subjects? choice of index terms 
in an information access task. Subjects showed 
significant preference for index terms that are 
longer, as measured by number of words, and 
more complex, as measured by number of prepo-
sitions. These terms, which were identified by a 
human indexer, serve as the gold standard. The 
experimental protocol is a reliable and rigorous 
method for evaluating the quality of a set of terms. 
An important advantage of this task-based evalua-
tion is that a set of index terms which is different 
than the gold standard can ?win? by providing 
better information access than the gold standard 
itself does. And although the individual human 
subject experiments are time consuming, the ex-
perimental interface, test materials and data 
analysis programs are completely re-usable.  
  
1 Introduction 
The standard metrics for evaluation of the output of 
NLP systems are precision and recall. Given an ar-
guably correct list of the units that a system would 
identify if it performed perfectly, there should in 
principle be no discrepancy between the units identi-
fied by a system and the units that are either useful in 
a particular application or are preferred by human 
beings for use in a particular task. But when the satis-
factory output can take many different forms, as in 
summarization and generation, evaluation by preci-
sion and recall is not sufficient. In these cases, the 
challenge for system designers and users is to effec-
tively distinguish between systems that provide gen-
erally satisfactory output and systems that do not.  
NP chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 
1995; Evans and Zhai 1996; Frantzi and Ananiadou 
1996) and technical terms (Dagan and Church 1994; 
Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 1996; Jacquemin 
2001; Bourigault et al 2002) fall into this difficult-to-
assess category. NPs are recursive structures. For the 
maximal NP large number of recent newspaper articles 
on biomedical science and clinical practice, a full-
fledged parser would legitimately identify (at least) 
seven NPs in addition to the maximal one: large 
number; recent newspaper articles; large number of 
recent newspaper articles; biomedical science; clini-
cal practice; biomedical science and clinical prac-
tice; and recent newspaper articles on biomedical 
science and clinical practice. To evaluate the per-
formance of a parser, NP chunks can usefully be 
evaluated by a gold standard; many systems (e.g., 
Ramshaw and Marcus 1995 and Cardie and Pierce 
1988) use the Penn Treebank for this type of evalua-
tion. But for most applications, output that lists a 
maximal NP and each of its component NPs is bulky 
and redundant. Even a system that achieves 100% 
precision and recall in identifying all of the NPs in a 
document needs criteria for determining which units 
to use in different contexts or applications.  
Technical terms are a subset of NP chunks. Jac-
quemin (2001:3) defines terms as multi-word ?vehi-
cles of scientific and technical information?. 1  The 
operational difficulty, of course, is to decide whether 
a specific term is a vehicle of scientific and technical 
information (e.g., birth date or light truck). Evalua-
tion of mechanisms that filter out some terms while 
retaining others is subject to this difficulty. This is 
exactly the kind of case where context plays a sig-
nificant role in deciding whether a term conforms to a 
definition and where experts disagree.  
In this paper, we turn to an information access 
task in order to assess terms identified by different 
techniques. There are two basic types of information 
access mechanisms, searching and browsing. In 
searching, the user generates the search terms; in 
                                                          
1 Jacquemin does not use the modifier technical.

browsing, the user recognizes potentially useful terms 
from a list of terms presented by the system. When an 
information seeker can readily think up a suitable 
term or linguistic expression to represent the informa-
tion need, direct searching of text by user-generated 
terms is faster and more effective than browsing. 
However, when users do not know (or can?t remem-
ber) the exact expression used in relevant documents, 
they necessarily struggle to find relevant information 
in full-text search systems. Experimental studies have 
repeatedly shown that information seekers use many 
different terms to describe the same concept and few 
of these terms are used frequently (Furnas et al 1987; 
Saracevic et al 1988; Bates et al 1998). When in-
formation seekers are unable to figure out the term 
used to describe a concept in a relevant document, 
electronic indexes are required for successful infor-
mation access.  
NP chunks and technical terms have been pro-
posed for use in this task (Boguraev and Kennedy 
1997; Wacholder 1998). NP chunks and technical 
terms have also been used in phrase browsing and 
phrase hierarchies (Jones and Staveley  1999;  Nevill-
Manning et al 1999; Witten et al 1999; Lawrie and 
Croft 2000) and summarization (e.g., McKeown et al 
1999; Oakes and Paice 2001). In fact, the distinction 
between task-based evaluation of a system and preci-
sion/recall evaluation of the quality of system output 
is similar to the extrinsic/intrinsic evaluation of 
summarization (Gallier and Jones 1993). 
In order to focus on the subjects? choice of index 
terms rather than on other aspects of the information 
access process, we asked subject to find answers to 
questions in a college level text book. Subjects used 
the Experimental Searching and Browsing Interface 
(ESBI) to browse a list of terms that were identified 
by different techniques and then merged. Subjects 
select an index term by clicking on it in order to hy-
perlink to the text itself. By design, ESBI forces the 
subjects to access the text indirectly, by searching 
and browsing the list of index terms, rather than by 
direct searching of the text.  
Three sets of terms were used in the experiment: 
one set (HS) was identified using the head-sorting 
method of Wacholder (1998); the second set (TT) 
was identified by an implementation of the technical 
term algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995); a third 
set (HUM) was created by a human indexer. The 
methods for identifying these terms will be discussed 
in greater detail below.  
Somewhat to our surprise, subjects displayed a 
very strong preference for the index terms that were 
identified by the human indexer. Table 1 shows that 
when measured by percentage terms selected, sub-
jects chose over 13% of the available human terms, 
but only 1.73% and 1.43% of the automatically se-
lected terms; by this measure the subjects? preference 
for the human terms was more than 7 times greater 
than the preference for either of the automatic tech-
niques. (In Table 1 and in the rest of this paper, all 
index term counts are by type rather than by token, 
unless otherwise indicated.)

terms 673 7980 1788

Percentage of 
terms selected 13.22% 1.43% 1.73% 
Table 1: Percentage of terms selected by human 
subjects relative to number of terms in the entire 
index. 
 
This initial experiment strongly indicates that 1) peo-
ple have a demonstrable preference for different 
types of index terms; 2) these human terms are a very 
good gold standard. If subjects use a greater propor-
tion of the terms identified by a particular technique, 
the terms can be judged better than the terms identi-
fied by another technique, even if the terms are dif-
ferent. Any automatic technique capable of 
identifying terms that are preferred over these human 
terms would be a very strong system indeed. Fur-
thermore, the properties of the terms preferred by the 
experimental subjects can be used to guide design of 
systems for identifying and selecting NP chunks and 
technical terms. 
In the next section, we describe the design of the 
experiment and in Section 3, we report on what the 
experimental data shows about human preferences 
for different kinds of index terms.   
2 Experimental design 
Our experiment assesses the index terms vis a vis 
their usefulness in a strictly controlled information 
access task. Subjects responded to a set of questions 
whose answers were contained in a 350 page college-
level text (Rice, Ronald E., McCreadie, Maureen and 
Chang, Shan-ju L. (2001) Accessing and Browsing 
Information and Communication. Cambridge, MA: 
MIT Press.) Subjects used the Experimental Search-
ing and Browsing Interface (ESBI) which forces 
them to access text via the index terms; direct text 
searching was prohibited. 25 subjects participated in 
the experiment; they were undergraduate and gradu-
ate students at Rutgers University. The experiments 
were conducted by graduate students at the Rutgers 
University School of Communication, Information 
and Library Studies (SCILS). 
2.1 ESBI (Experimental Searching and Brows-
ing Interface) 
Subjects used the Experimental Searching and 
Browsing Interface (ESBI) to find the answers to the 
questions. After an initial training session, ESBI pre-
sents the user with a Search/Browse screen (not 
shown); the question appears at the top of the screen.  
The subject may enter a string to search for in the 
index, or click on the "Browse" button for access to 
the whole index. At this point, "search" and "browse" 
apply only to the list of index terms, not to the text.  
The user may either browse the entire list of index 
terms or may enter a search term and specify criteria 
to select the subset of terms that will be returned. 
Most people begin with the latter option because the 
complete list of index terms is too long to be easily 
browsed.  The user may select (click on) an index 
term to view a list of the contexts in which the term 
appears. If the context appears useful, the user may 
choose to view the term in its full context; if not, the 
user may either do additional browsing or start the 
process over again. 
Figure 1 shows a screen shot of ESBI after the 
searcher has entered the string democracy in the 
search box. This view shows the demo question and 
the workspace for entering answers. The string was 
(previously) entered in the search box and all index 
terms that include the word democracy are displayed. 
Although it is not illustrated here, ESBI also permits 
substring searching and the option to specify case 
sensitivity.  
Regardless of the technique by which the term 
was identified, terms are organized by grammatical 
head of the phrase. Preliminary analysis of our results 
has shown that most subjects like this analysis, which 
resembles standard organization of back-of-the-book 
indexes.  
Readers may notice that the word participation 
appears at the left-most margin, where it represents 
the set of terms whose head is participation. The in-
dented occurrence represents the individual term. 
Selecting the left-most occurrence brings up contexts 
for all phrases for which participation is a head. Se-
lecting on the indented occurrence brings up contexts 
for the noun participation only when it is not part of 
a larger phrase. This is explained to subjects during 
the pre-experimental training and an experimenter is 
present to remind subjects of this distinction if a 
question arises during the experiment. 
Readers may also notice that in Figure 1, one of 
the terms, participation require, is ungrammatical. 
This particular error was caused by a faulty part-of-
speech tag. But since automatically identified index 
terms typically include some nonsensical terms, we 
have left these terms in ? these terms are one of the 
problems that information seekers have to cope with 
in a realistic task-based evaluation.

2.2 Questions 
After conducting initial testing to find out what types 
of questions subjects founder hard or easy, we spent 
considerable effort to design a set of 26 questions of 
varying degrees of difficulty. To obtain an initial 
assessment of difficulty, one of the experimenters 
used ESBI to answer all of the questions and rate 
each question with regard to how difficult it was to 
answer using the ESBI system. For example, the 
question What are the characteristics of 
Marchionini's model of browsing? was rated very 
easy because searching on the string marchionini 
reveals an index term Marchionini's which is linked 
to the text sentence: Marchionini's model of browsing 
considers five interactions among the information-
seeking factors of "task, domain, setting, user charac-
teristics and experience, and system content and in-
terface" (p.107). The question What factors 
determine when users decide to stop browsing? was 
rated very difficult because searching on stop (or 
synonyms such as halt, cease, end, terminate, finish, 
etc.) reveals no helpful index terms, while searching 
on factors or browsing yields an avalanche of over 
500 terms, none with any obvious relevance.   
After subjects finished answering each question, 
they were asked to rate the question in terms of its 
difficulty. A positive correlation between judgments 
of the experimenters and the experimental subjects 
(Sharp et al, under submission) confirmed that we 
had successfully devised questions with a range of 
difficulty.  In general, questions that included terms 
actually used in the index were judged easier; ques-
tions where the user had to devise the index terms 
were judged harder. 
To avoid effects of user learning, questions were 
presented to subjects in random order; in the one hour 
experiment, subjects answered an average of about 9 
questions.  
 
2.3 Terms 
Although the primary goal of this research is to point 
the way to improved techniques for automatic crea-
tion of index terms, we used human created terms to 
create a baseline. For the human index terms, we 
used the pre-existing back-of-the-book index, which 
we believe to be of high quality.2 
The two techniques for automatic identification 
were the technical terms algorithm of Justeson and 
Katz (1995) and the head sorting method (Dagan and 
Church (1994); Wacholder (1998). In the implemen-
tation of the Justeson and Katz? algorithm, technical 
terms are multi-word NPs repeated above some 
threshold in a corpus; in the head sorting method, 
technical terms are identified by grouping noun 
phrases with a common head (e.g., health-care work-
ers  and asbestos workers), and selecting as terms 
those NPs whose heads appear in two or more 
phrases. Definitionally, technical terms are a proper 
subset of terms identified by Head Sorting. Differ-
ences in the implementations, especially the pre-
processing module, result in there being some terms 
identified by Termer that were not identified by Head 
Sorting.   
Table 2 shows the number of terms identified by 
each method. (*Because some terms are identified by 
more than one technique, the percentage adds up to 
more than 100%.) The fewest terms (673) were iden-
tified by the human method; in part this reflects the 
judgment of the indexer and in part it is a result of 
restrictions on index length in a printed text. The 
largest number of terms (7980) was identified by the 
head sorting method. This is because it applies  
looser criteria for determining a term than does the 
Justeson and Katz algorithm which imposes a very 
strict standard--no single word can be considered a 
term, and an NP must be repeated in full to be con-
sidered a term.

Wacholder et al (2000) showed that when experi-
mental subjects were asked to assess the usefulness 
of terms for an information access task without actu-
ally using the terms for information access showed 
that the terms identified by the technical term algo-
rithm, which are considerably fewer than the terms 
identified by head sorting, were overall of higher 
quality than the terms identified by the head sorting 
method. However, the fact that subjects assigned a 
high rank to many of the terms identified by Head 
Sorting suggested that the technical term algorithm 
was failing to pick up many potentially useful index 
terms.  
In preparation for the experiment, all index terms 
were merged into a single list and duplicates were 
removed, resulting in a list of nearly 10,000 index 
terms. 
 
2.4 Tracking results 
In the experiment, we logged the terms that sub-
jects searched for (i.e., entered in a search box) and 
selected. In this paper, we report only on the terms 
that the subjects selected (i.e., clicked on). This is 
because if a subject entered a single word, or a sub-
part of a word in the search box, ESBI returned to 
them a list of index terms; the subject then selected a 
term to view the context in which it appears in the 
text. This term might have been the same term origi-
nally searched for or it might have been a super-
string. The terms that subjects selected for searching 
are interesting in their own right, but are not analyzed 
here.  
3 Results 
At the outset of this experiment, we did not know 
whether it would be possible to discover differences 
in human preferences for terms in the information 
access task reported on in this paper. We therefore 
started our research with the null hypothesis that all 
index terms are created equal. If users selected index 
terms in roughly the same proportion as the terms 
occur in the text, the null hypothesis would be 
proven. 
 The results strongly discredit the null hypothesis. 
Table 3 shows that when measured by percentage of 
terms selected, subjects selected on over 13.2% of the 
available human terms, but only 1.73% and 1.43% 
respectively of the automatically selected terms. Ta-
ble 3 also shows that although the human index terms 
formed only 6% of the total number of index terms, 
40% of the terms which were selected by subjects in 
order to view the context were identified by human 
indexing. Although 80% of the index terms were 
identified by head sorting, only 51% of the terms 
subjects chose to select had been identified by this 
method. (*Because of overlap of terms selected by 
different techniques, total is greater than 100%)

To determine whether the numbers represent statisti-
cally significant evidence that the null hypothesis is 
wrong, we represent the null hypothesis (HT)) as (1) 
and the falsification of the null hypothesis (HA) as 
(2). 
         HT: P1/?1 = P2/?2                          (1) 
         HA:  P1/?1 ? P2/?2                          (2)     
Pi is the expected percentage of the selected terms 
that are type i in all the selected terms; ?i is the ex-
pected percentage if there is no user preference, i.e. 
the proportion of this term type i in all the terms. We 
rewrite the above as (3). 
HT: X = 0    HA: X ? 0    X = P1/?1 ? P2/?2    (3) 
Assuming that X is normally distributed, we can use 
a one-sample t test on X to decide whether to accept 
the hypothesis (1). The two-tailed t test (df =222) 
produces a p-value of less than .01% for the compari-
son of the expected and selected proportions of a) 
human terms and head sorted terms and b) human 
terms and technical terms. In contrast, the p-value for 
the comparison of head-sorted and technical terms 
was 33.7%, so we draw no conclusions about relative 
preferences for head sorted and technical terms.  
We also considered the possibility that our formu-
lation of questions biased the terms that the subjects 
selected, perhaps because the words of the questions 
overlapped more with the terms selected by one of 
the methods. 3 We took the following steps:  
1) For each search word, calculate the number of 
terms overlapping with it from each source. 
2) Based on these numbers, determine the proportion 
of terms provided by each method. 
3) Sum the proportions of all the search words. 
As measured by the terms the subjects saw during 
browsing, 22% were human terms, 62% were head 
sorted terms and 16% were technical terms. Using the 
same reasoning about the null hypothesis as above, 
the p-value for the comparison of the ratios of human 
and head sorted terms was less than 0.01%, as was 
the comparison of the ratios of the human and techni-
cal terms. This supports the validity of the results of 
the initial test. In contrast, the p-value for the com-
parison of the two automatic techniques was 77.3%.  
Why did the subjects demonstrate such a strong 
preference for the human terms? Table 4 illustrates 
some important differences between the human terms 
and the automatically identified terms. The terms 
selected on are longer, as measured in number of 
words, and more complex, as measured by number of 
prepositions per index terms and by number of con-
tent-bearing words. As shown in Table 5, the differ-
ence of these complexity measures between human 
terms and automatically identified terms are statisti-
cally significant. 
Since longer terms are more specific than shorter 
terms (for example, participation in a democracy is 
longer and more specific than democracy), the results 
suggest that subjects prefer the more specific terms. 
If this result is upheld in future research, it has practi-
cal implications for the design of automatic term 
identification systems.

4.3    Relationship between Term Source and 
Search Effectiveness 
In this paper, our primary focus is on the question of 
what makes index terms 'better', as measured by user 
preferences in a question-answering task. Also of 
interest, of course, is what makes index terms 'better' 
in terms of how accurate the resulting users' answers 
are.   The problem is that any facile judgment of free-
text answer accuracy is bound to be arbitrary and 
potentially unreliable; we discuss this in detail in 
[26].  Nevertheless, we address the issue in a prelimi-
nary way in the current paper.  We used an ad hoc set 
of canonical answers to score subjects' answers on a 
scale of 1 to 3, where 1 stands for 'very accurate', 2 
stands for 'partly accurate' and 3 represents 'not at all 
accurate'. Using general loglinear regression (Poisson 
model) under the hypothesis that these two variables 
are independent of each other, our analysis showed 
that there is a systematic relationship (significance 
probability is 0.0504) between source of selected 
terms and answer accuracy. Specifically, in cases 
where subjects used more index terms identified by 
the human indexer, the answers were more accurate. 
On the basis of our initial accuracy judgments, we 
can therefore draw the preliminary conclusion that 
terms that were better in that they were preferred by 
the experimental subjects were also better in that they 
were associated with better answers. We plan to con-
duct a more in-depth analysis of answer accuracy and 
will report on it in future work.   
But the primary question addressed in this paper 
is how to reliably assess NP chunks and technical 
terms. These results constitute experimental evidence 
that the index terms identified by the human indexer 
constitute a gold standard, at least for the text used in 
the experiment. Any set of index terms, regardless of 
the technique by which they were created or the crite-
ria by they were selected, can be compared vis a vis 
their usefulness in the information access task. 
4 Discussion 
The contribution of this paper is the description of a 
task-based gold-standard method for evaluating the 
usefulness and therefore the quality of NP chunks 
and technical terms. In this section, we address a 
number of questions about this method.  
1) What properties of terms can this technique 
be used to study?  
? One word or many. There are two parts to 
the process of identifying NP terms: NP 
chunks that are candidate terms must be 
identified and candidate terms must be fil-
tered in order to select a subset appropriate 
for use in the intended application. Justeson 
and Katz (1995) is an example of an algo-
rithm where the process used for identifying 
NP chunks is also the filtering process. A 
byproduct of this technique is that single-
word terms are excluded. In part, this is be-
cause it is much harder to determine in con-
text which single words actually qualify as 
terms. But dictionaries of technical termi-
nology have many one-word terms.   
? Simplex or complex NPs (e.g., Church 
1988; Hindle and Rooth 1991; Wacholder 
1998) identify simplex or base NPs ? NPs 
which do not have any component NPs -- at 
least in part because this bypasses the need 
to solve the quite difficult attachment prob-
lem, i.e., to determine which simpler NPs 
should be combined to output a more com-
plex NP.  But if people find complex NPs 
more useful than simpler ones, it is impor-
tant to focus on improvement of techniques 
to reliably identify more complex terms. 
? Semantic and syntactic terms variants. 
Daille et al (1996), Jacquemin (2001) and 
others address the question of how to iden-
tify semantic (synonymous) and syntactic 
variants. But independent of the question of 
how to recognize variants is the question of 
which variants are to be preferred for differ-
ent kinds of uses. 
? Impact of errors. Real-world NLP systems 
have a measurable error rate. By conducting 
experiments in which terms with errors are 
include in the set of test terms, the impact of 
these errors can be measured. The useful-
ness of a set of terms presumably is at least 
in part a function of the impact of the errors, 
whether the errors are a by-product of the 
algorithm or the implementation of the algo-
rithm. 
 
2) Could the set of human index terms be used 
as a gold standard without conducting the 
human subject experiments? This of course 
could be done, but then the terms are being 
evaluated by a fixed standard ? by definition, no 
set of terms can do better than the gold standard. 
This experimental method leaves open the possi-
bility that there is a set of terms that is better 
than the gold standard. In this case, of course, the 
gold standard would no longer be a gold standard 
-- perhaps we would have to call it a platinum 
standard. 
 
3) How reproducible is the experiment? The ex-
periment can be re-run with any set of terms 
deemed to be representative of the content of the 
Rice text. The preparation of the materials for 
additional texts is admittedly time-consuming. 
But over time a sizable corpus of experimental 
materials in different domains could be built up. 
These materials could be used for training as 
well as for testing. 
          
4) How extensible is the gold standard? The ex-
perimental protocol will be validated only if 
equally useful index terms can be created for 
other texts. We anticipate that they can. 
  
5) How can this research help in the design of 
real world NLP systems? This technique can 
help in assessing the relative usefulness of exist-
ing techniques for identifying terms. It is possi-
ble, for example, there already exist techniques 
for identifying terms that are superior to the two 
tested here. If we can find such systems, their al-
gorithms should be preferred. If not, there re-
mains a need for development of algorithms to 
identify single word terms and complex phrases. 
 
6) Do the benefits of this evaluation technique 
outweigh the costs?  Given the fundamental dif-
ficulty of evaluating NP chunks and technical 
terms, task-based evaluation is a promising sup-
plement to evaluation by precision and recall. 
These relatively time-consuming human subject 
experiments surely will not be undertaken by 
most system developers; ideally, they should be 
performed by neutral parties who do not have a 
stake in the outcome.  
 
7) Should automated indexes try to imitate hu-
man indexers? Automated indexes should  con-
tain terms that are most easily processed by 
users. If the properties of such terms can be re-
liably discovered, developers of systems that 
identify terms intended to be processed by peo-
ple surely should pay attention.  
 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper we have reported on a rigorous experi-
mental technique for black-box evaluation of the use-
fulness of NP chunks and technical terms in an 
information access task. Our experiment shows that it 
is possible to reliably identify human preferences for 
sets of terms.  
The set of human terms created for use in a back-
of-the-book index serves as a gold standard. An ad-
vantage of the task-based evaluation is that a set of 
terms could outperform the gold standard; any system 
that could do this would be a good system indeed.  
The two automatic methods that we evaluated 
performed much less well than the terms created by 
the human indexer; we plan to evaluate additional 
techniques for term identification in the hope of iden-
tifying automatic methods that identify index terms 
that people prefer over the human terms. We also 
plan to prepare test materials in different domains, 
and assess in greater depth the properties of the terms 
that our experimental subjects preferred; our goal is 
to develop practical guidelines for the identification 
and selection of technical terms that are optimal for 
human users. We will also study the impact of se-
mantic differences between terms on user preferences 
and investigate whether terms which are preferred for 
information access are equally suitable for other NLP 
tasks.
