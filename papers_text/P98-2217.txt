Abstract 
The paper presents a tabular interpretation for a 
kind of 2-Stack Automata. These automata may be 
used to describe various parsing strategies, ranging 
from purely top-down to purely bottom-up, for LIGs 
and TAGs. The tabular interpretation ensures, for 
all strategies, a time complexity in O(n 6) and space 
complexity in O(n 5) where n is the length of the 
input string. 
In t roduct ion  
2-Stack automata \[2SA\] have been identified as pos- 
sible operational devices to describe parsing strate- 
gies for Linear Indexed Grammars \[LIG\] or Tree Ad- 
joining Grammars \[TAG\] (mirroring the traditional 
use of Push-Down Automata \[PDA\] for Context- 
Free Grammars \[CFG\]). Different variants of 2SA 
(or not so distant Embedded Push-Down Automata) 
have been proposed, some to describe top-down 
strategies (Vijay-Shanker, 1988; Becker, 1994), some 
to describe bottom-up strategies (Rambow, 1994; 
Nederhof, 1998; Alonso Pardo et al, 1997), but none 
(that we know) that are able to describe both kinds 
of strategies. 
The same dichotomy also exists in the different 
tabular algorithms that has been proposed for spe- 
cific parsing strategies with complexity ranging from 
O(n 6) for bottom-up strategies to O(n 9) for prefix- 
valid top-down strategies (with the exception of a 
O(n 6) tabular interpretation of a prefix-valid hybrid 
strategy (Nederhof, 1997)). It must also be noted 
that the different abular algorithms may be diffi- 
cult to understand and it is often unclear to know if 
the algorithms till hold for different strategies. 
This paper overcomes these problems by (a) in- 
troducing strongly-driven 2SA \[SD-2SA\] that may 
be used to describe parsing strategies for TAGs 
and LIGs, ranging from purely top-down to purely 
bottom-up, and (b) presenting a tabular interpre- 
tation of these automata in time complexity O(n 6) 
and space complexity O(nS). 
The tabular interpretation follows the principles 
of Dynamic Programming: the derivations are bro- 
ken into elementary sub-derivations that may (a) be 
combined in different contexts to retrieve all possi- 
ble derivations and (b) be represented in a compact 
way by items, allowing tabulation. 
The strongly-driven 2SA are introduced and moti- 
vated in Section 1. We illustrate in Sections 2 and 3 
their power by describing several parsing strategies 
for LIGs and TAGs. Items are presented in Sec- 
tion 4. Section 5 lists the rules to combine items and 
transitions and establishes correctness theorems. 
1 S t rong ly -dr iven  2 -Stack  Automata  
2SA are natural extensions of Push-Down Automata 
working on a pair of stacks. However, it is known 
that unrestricted 2SA have the power of a Turing 
Machine. The remedy is to consider asymmetric 
stacks, one being the Master Stack MS where most 
of the work is done and the other being the Auxiliary 
Stack AS mainly used for restricted "bookkeeping". 
The following remarks are intended to give an idea 
of the restrictions we want to enforce. The first ones 
are rather standard and may be found under differ- 
ent forms in the literature. The last one justifies the 
qualification of "strongly-driven" for our automata. 
\[Session\] AS should actually be seen as a stack of 
session stacks, each one being associated to a 
session. Only the topmost session stack may 
be consulted or modified. This idea is closely 
related to the notion of Embedded Push-Down 
Automata (Rambow, 1994, 96-102). 
\[Linearity\] A session starts in mode write w and 
switches at some point in mode erase e. In 
mode w (resp. e), no element can be popped 
from (resp. pushed to) the master stack MS. 
Switching back from e to w is not allowed. This 
requirement is related to linearity because it 
means that a same session stack is never used 
twice by "descendants" of an element in MS. 
\[Soft Session Exit\] Exiting a session is only possi- 
ble when reaching back, with an empty session 
stack and in mode erase, the MS element hat 
initiated the session. 
\[Driving\] Each pushing on MS done in write mode 
leaves some mark in MS about the action that

Master stack 
Figure 1: Representation f transitions and derivations 
took place on the session stack. The popping 
of this mark (in erase mode) will guide which 
action should take place on the session stack. 
In other words, we want the erasing actions to 
faithfully retrace the writing actions. 
Formally, a SD-2SA .A is specified by a tuple 
(~, .M, X, $0, $l, O) where ~ denotes the finite set of 
terminals, .M the finite set of master stack elements 
and X the finite set of auxiliary stack elements. The 
init symbol $0 and final symbol $y are distinguished 
elements of Ad. O is a finite set of transitions. 
The master stack MS is a word in (D.M)* where 
2) denotes the set {/~, x.~, ---% ~} of act ion  marks  
used to remember which action (w.r.t. the auxiliary 
stack AS) takes place when pushing the next master 
stack element. The empty master stack is noted e 
and a non-empty master stack ~1A1 ...  ~nAn where 
A,~ denotes the topmost element. 
The meaning of the action marks is: 
/2 Pushing of an element on AS. 
"x~ Popping of the topmost element of AS. 
--* No action on AS. 
Creation of a new session (with a new empty 
session stack on AS). 
The auxiliary stack AS is a word of (K:X*)* where 
K: = {~w,~e} is a set of two elements used to 
delimit session stacks in AS. Delimiter ~w (resp. 
~e)  is used to start a new session from a session 
which is in writing (resp. erasing) mode. The empty 
auxiliary stack is noted e. 
Given some input string xl . . .  x i  E E*, a configu- 
ration of .A is a tuple (m, u, ~, ~) where m E {w, e} 
denotes a mode (writing or erasing), u a string posi- 
tion in \[0, f\], -- the master stack and ~ the auxiliary 
stack. Modes are ordered by w -~ e to capture the 
fact that no switching from e to w is possible. The 
initial configuration of ,4 is (w, 0, ~$0, ~w)  and the 
final one (e, f ,  ~$f, ~W). 
A transition is given as a pair (p, --, ~), z (q, O, 0) 
where p, q are modes (or, with some abuse, variables 
ranging over modes), z in E*, .-- and O suffixes of 
master stacks in .M(2)Ad)*, and ~,0 suffixes of aux- 
iliary stacks in X*(~gX*)* = (XUK:)*. Such a transi- 
tion applies on any configuration (p, u, k~--, ~b~) such 
that xu+l . . .  x ,  = z and returns (q, v, ~0,  ?0). 
We restrict the kind of allowed transitions: 
SWAP (p, A, ~), z (q, B, ~) with p _ q and either 
e K: ("session bottom check") or ~ = e ("no 
AS consultation") . 
/ -WRITE  (w,A, e), z (w, ATB,  b) 
/ -ERASE (e, A/ZB,a) , z (e, D, e)

x ,~-WRITE  (w, A, a),  ~, (w, A'x~B, e) 
"~-ERASE (e, A"~B, e) , ~ , (e, C, c) 
Figure 1 graphically outlines the different kinds 
of transitions using a 2D representation where the 
X-axis (Y-axis) is related to the master (resp. aux- 
iliary) stack. Figure 1 also shows the two forms of 
derivations we encounter (during a same session). 
2 Us ing  2SA to  parse  L IGs  
Indexed Grammars (Aho, 1968) are an extension of 
Context-free Grammars in which a stack of indices 
is associated with each non-terminal symbol. Linear 
Indexed Grammars (Gazdar, 1987) are a restricted 
form of Indexed Grammars in which the index stack 
of at most one body non-terminal (the child) is re- 
lated with the stack of the head non-terminal (the 
father). The other stacks of the production must 
have a bounded stack size. 
Formally, a LIG G is a 5-tuple (VT, VN, S, VI,P) 
where VT is a finite set of terminals, VN is a finite 
set of non-terminals, S E VN is the start symbol, 
VI is a finite set of indices and P is a finite set of 
productions. Following (Gazdar, 1987) we consider 
productions in which at most one element can be 
pushed on or popped from a stack of indices: 
1334 
\[Terminal\] Ak,o\[\] --+ ak where ak ? VT U {?}, 
\[POP\] Ak,o \[oo\] --. Ak,t \ [ \ ] . . .  Ak,d\[oo'y\]... Ak,.~ \[\] 
\[PUSH\] Ak,0\[ooT\]--* Ak,1 \ [ \ ] . . .  Ak,d\[OO\]... Ak,,~ \[\] 
\[HOR\] Ak,0\[oo\] ~ ak,1 \[1... Ak,d\[OO\]... a~,,~ \[1 
To each production k of type PUSH, POP or 
HOR, we associate a characteristic tuple t(k) = 
(d, 5, a,/3) where d is the position of the child and 
the other arguments given by the following table: 
Type 5 a 
PUSH /z e 7 
POP ~ 7 e 
HOR ---* e ? 
We introduce symbols ~'k,i as a shortcut for dotted 
productions \[Ak,0~Ak,1 ... Ak,i ? Ak,i+ l .. .  Ak,,~ \]. 
In order to design a broad class of parsing strate- 
gies ranging from pure top-down to pure bottom-up, 
we parameterize the automaton to be presented by 
a call projection -'* from 12 to )2 cart and a return 
projection *'-" from 12 to "W et where ~ = VN U VI 
and \]2 cart and V ret are two sets of elements. We re- 
quire \]2 cart N \]2 ret = 0 and ("-*, +'-) to be invertible, 
i.eVX, rev ,  (X ,*X)  = (V ,  ~)  =:~ x = r 
The projections extend to sequences by taking 
X1. . .  X :  = X-~I ...  ~ and "~ =e (similarly for +-). 
Given a LIG G and a choice of projections, we 
define the 2SA .A(G, -~, = ~-) (Vr, M,  X, -~, ~ ,  O) 
where M = {Vk,i}U~TU~TT, X = ~//U~//, and whose 
transitions are built using the following rules. 
? Call/Return of a non child 
CALL :  (m, Vk,i,e)* , (w, Vk , i~ ,~ rn) 
RET:  (e, , (m, Vk,i+,,e) 
? Call/Return of a child for t(k) = (i + 1,5, a,/3). 
CALL(5) : (w, Vk,i, W),  ~_~ (w, Vk,iSAk,-~+l, "-~) 
RET(5) : (e, Vk,iSAk,i++'-'-';1, /3) , , (e, Vk.i+l, W) 
? Production Selection 
SEL:  (w,A---~,0, e), , (w, Vk,0, e) 
? Production Publishing 
PUB:  (e, Vk,n~,e), , (e, ~0k,0, e) 
? Scanning (for terminal productions) 
SCAN : (w, ' m a~ ~ m Ak,0, ~ )~---*(e, Ak,0, ~ ) 
The reader may easily check that A(G,-'-*, ~-'-) 
recognizes L(G). The choice of the call and re turn  
elements for the MS (A~k,i and Ak,i) and the AS 
('-~ and ~')  defines a parsing strategy, by controlling 
how information flow between the phases of predic- 
tion and propagation. The following table lists the 
choices corresponding to the main parsing strategies 
(but others are definable). 
Strategy ~ ~- -~ ~- 
Top-Down A _l_ 7 .l_ 
Bottom-Up 2. A' _l_ 7 
Earley A A' 7 7' 
It is also worth to note that the descrip- 
tion of A(G,-*,  +--) could be simplified. In- 
deed, for every configuration (m,u,E,~) deriv- 
able with .A(G, "--*,*-"), we can show that --- = 
~Vk l , i lS t . . .  Vk.,i,,SnX, and that 5t only depends 
on Vk~,i~. That means that we could use a master 
stack without action marks, these marks being im- 
plicitly given by the elements XTk,i. 
3 Us ing  2SA to  parse  TAGs  
Tree Adjoining Grammars are a extension of CFG 
introduced by Joshi in (Joshi, 1987) that use 
trees instead of productions as primary represent- 
ing structure. Formally, a TAG is a 5-tuple G = 
(VN,VT, S , I ,A) ,  where VN is a finite set of non- 
terminal symbols, VT a finite set of terminal sym- 
bols, S the axiom of the grammar, I a finite set of 
initial trees and A a finite set of auxiliary trees. IUA 
is the set of elementary trees. Internal nodes are la- 
beled by non-terminals and leaf nodes by terminals 
or e, except for exactly one leaf per auxiliary tree 
(the foot) which is labeled by the same non-terminal 
used as label of its root node. 
New trees are derived by adjoining: let be a a 
tree containing a node u labeled by A and let be 
fl an auxiliary tree whose root and foot nodes are 
also labeled by A. Then, the adjoining of/3 at the 
adjunction ode u is obtained by excising the subtree 
a~ of a with root u, attaching/3 to u and attaching 
the excised subtree to the foot of/3 (See Fig. 2). 
pine 
Figure 2: Traversal of an adjunction 
An elementary tree a may be represented by a 
set P(a)  of context free productions, each one being 
either of the form 
? Yk,O ---4 Pk ,1 . . .  Pk,n~, where Yk,o denotes some 
non-leaf node k of a and uk,i the i th son  of k. 
1335 
? vk,0 --* al?, where vk,0 denotes ome leaf node k 
of c~ with terminal abel ak. 
As done for LIGs, we introduce symbols Vk,i 
to denote dotted productions and consider pro- 
jections "* and ~ to define the parameterized 
2SA .A(G, -'-*, *") = (VT, At, At, v0,0, ~0,0, O) where 
At = {Vk,i) U {vk,i} U {v~,/). The transitions are 
given by the following rules (and illustrated in Fig- 
ure 2). 
? Call / Return for a node not on a spine. The 
call starts a new session, exited at return. 
CALL  : (m, Vk,i,e) , , (w ,  
m RET:  (e, Vk , /~vk. i+ l ,~ ) '  ' (m, Vk,i+l,e) 
? Call / Return for a node vk,i+l on a spine. 
The adjunction stack is propagated un-modified 
along the spine. 
SCALL  : (w, Vk,i,e), , (w, Vk,i---*vk,i+~,e) 
SRET : (e, Vk,i--*bk,i+l, e) , ~ (e, Vk,i+l,e) 
? Call / Return for an adjunction on node uk,0. 
The computation is diverted to parse some ac- 
ceptable auxiliary tree ~ (with root node rh), 
and a continuation point is stored on the auxil- 
iary stack. 
ACALL  : (w, vk,0,e) , , Vk,o/Zr~,Vk,o) 
ARET:  (e,v~,o/ZF3Z,Vk,,~), , (e, ~-" e) /\]k,0, 
? Call / Return for a foot node f~. The continu- 
ation stored by the adjunction is used to parse 
the excised subtree. 
FCALL  : (w, f~,A) ,- , (w, f-'-~"~A, e) 
FRET : (e, f~'%A,~) , , (e, \]~,A) 
Note: These two transitions use a variable A 
over At. This is a slight extension of 2SA that 
preserves correctness and complexity.

Different parsing strategies can be obtained by 
choosing the call (vk,i) and re turn  (vk,i) elements: 
Strategy 
prefix-valid Top-Down v _l_ 
Bottom-Up _L v' 
prefix-valid Earley v v' 
Non prefix-valid variants of the top-down and 
Earley-like strategies can also be defined, by tak- 
ing ~ = _L and ~ = r~ for every root node r~ of 
an auxiliary tree j3 (the projections being unmodi- 
fied on the other elements). In other words, we get 
a full prediction on the context-free backbone of G 
but no prediction on the adjunctions. 
4 I tems 
We identify two kinds of elementary deriva- 
tions, namely Context -F ree  \[CF\] and escaped 
Context -F ree  \[xCF\] derivations, respectively rep- 
resented by CF and xCF items. An item keeps the 
pertinent information relative to a derivation, which 
allows to apply the sequence of transitions associ- 
ated with the derivation in different contexts. 
Before presenting these items, we introduce the 
following classification about derivations. 
A derivation (p,u, EA,~)\[--~7 / (q,v,O,O) is said 
r ightward  if no element of E is accessed (even for 
consultation) during the derivation and if A is only 
consulted. Then F~A is a prefix of O. 
Similarly, a derivation (p, u, E, ~)1-~" (q, v, O, 0) is 
said upward  if no element of ~ is accessed (even for 
consultation). Then ~ is a prefix of 0. 
We also note w\[q/p\] the prefix substitution of p by 
q for all words w,p, q on some vocabulary such that 
p is prefix of w. 
4.1 Context -F ree  Der ivat ions  
A Context -F ree  \[CF\] derivation only depends on 
the topmost element A of the initial stack MS. That 
means that no element of the initial AS and no ele- 
ment of MS below element A is needed: 
(o, u , -A ,  ~)l-~l (w, v, OB, 0)1-~2 (m, w, OBhC, ~c) 
where 
? dl and did2 are both rightward and upward. 
? d 2 is rightward. 
? either (5 # ~,  o = w, and c e A') or 
(5 = ~,  and c = ~o). 
For such a derivation, we have: 
P ropos i t ion  4.1 For all prefix stacks E',~', 
(o,u,E'A,(') I-~, (w,v, O'B,8')  
(re, w, O 'B6C, (c )  
where  O '  = and o' = O\[gl \]. 
The proposition suggests representing the CF 
derivation by a CF item of the form 
ABh(7, m 
where A = (u, A) and B = (v, B) are micro  config- 
urations and (7 = (w, C, c) a mini  configuration.

An escaped Context -F ree  \[xCF\] derivation is al-

The proposition suggests representing the xCF 
derivation by an xCF item of the form 
ABS\[i:) E\]Ce 
where A = (u,A), B -- (v,B/, /~ = (s,D,d/ ,  E = 
(t, E / and C -- (w, C, c/. 
In order to homogenize notations, we also use 
the alternate notation ABS\[oo\]Cm to represent CF 
item ABSC'rn, introducing a dummy symbol o. 
The specific forms taken by CF and xCF items for 
the different actions 5 are outlined in Figure 3. 
5 Combin ing i tems and transit ions 
We provide the rules to combine items and transi- 
tions in order to retrieve all possible 2SA derivations. 
These rules do not explicit the scanning con- 
straints and suppose that the string z may be read 
between positions w and k of the input string? They 
use holes * to denote slots that not need be con- 
sulted. For any mini configuration A = (u, A, a), we 
note ~o = (u, A) its micro projection?

The best way to apprehend these rules is to vi- 
sualize them graphically as done for the two most

5.1 Reducing the complexity 
An analysis of the time complexity to apply each rule 
gives us polynomial complexities O(n") with u <_ 6 
except for Rule 9 where u = 8. However, by adapt- 
ing an idea from (Nederhof, 1997), we replace Rule 9 
by the alternate and equivalent Rule 11.

and (when O ? v) O = (l, O, b). 
Rule 11 has same complexity than Rule 9, but may 
actually be split into two rules of lesser complex- 
ity O(n6), introducing an intermediary pseudo-item

Theorem 5.1 The worst time complexity of the ap- 
plication rules (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,13) is O(n 6) 
where n is the length of the input string. The worst 
space complexity is O(nS). 
5.2 Correctness results 
Two main theorems establish the correctness of 
derivable items w.r.t, derivable configurations. 
A derivable item is either the initial i tem or 
an item resulting from the application of a combi- 
nation rules on derivable items. The initial item 
(0, e)(0, e)~\[oo\] <0, $0, ~w> w stands for the virtual 
derivation step (w, 0, e, e)\[- (w, 0, ~$0, ~w).  
Theorem 5.2 (Soundness)For  every derivable 
item Z = AB6\[?IE\]Cm, there exists a derivation 
on configurations 
(o, e) I-D--- Ul~- v 
such that H\[-~- V is a CF or xCF derivation repre- 
sentable by I. 
Proof: By induction on the item derivation length 
and by case analysis. I

Theorem 5.3 (Completeness) For all derivable 
configuration (m, w, EC , ~c), there exists a derivable 
item AB~\[DE\]Cm such that C = (w, C, c}. 
Proof: By induction on the configuration deriva- 
tion length and by case analysis of the different ap- 
plication rules. We also need the following "Extrac- 
tion Lemma". | 
Proposition 5.1 From any derivation 
(0, e)I--~- (m, w, EC, ~c) 
may be extracted a suffix CF or xCF sub-derivation 
U\[~ (m, .,, ~.C, ~c) for some configuration U. 
5.3 Illustration 
In the context of TAG parsing (Sect. 3), we can 
provide some intuition of the items that are built 
with .A(G, "-*, +-), using some characteristic points 
encountered during the traversal of an adjunction 
(Fig. 6).

This paper unifies different results about TAGs and 
LIGs in an uniform setting and illustrates the ad- 
vantages of a clear distinction between the use of 
an operational device and the evaluation of this de- 
vice. The operational device (here SD-2SA) helps us 
to focus on the description of parsing strategies (for 
LIGs and TAGs), while, independently, wedesign an 
efficient evaluation mechanism for this device (here 
tabular interpretation with complexity O(n6)). 
Besides illustrating a methodology, we believe our 
approach also opens new axes of research. 
For instance, even if the tabular interpretation 
we have presented has (we believe) the best possi- 
ble complexity, it is still possible (using techniques 
outside the scope of this paper, (Barth61emy and 
Villemonte de la Clergerie, 1996)) to improve its ef- 
ficiency by refining what information should be kept 
in each kind of items (hence increasing computation 
sharing and reducing the number of items). 
To handle TAGs or LIGs with attributes, we also 
plan to extend SD-2SA to deal with first-order terms 
(rather than just symbols) using unification to apply 
transitions and subsumption to check items.
