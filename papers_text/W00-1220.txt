Temporal information analysis is very 
important for Chinese Information Process. 
Comparing with English, Chinese is quite 
different in temporal information 
expression. Based on the feature of Chinese 
a phase-based method is proposed to deal 
with Chinese temporal information. To this 
end, an algorithm is put forward to classify 
verbs into different situation types 
automatically. About 2981 verbs were 
tested. The result has shown that the 
algorithm is effective. 
1.*Introduction 
We are now launching a research 
project on Events Extraction from Chinese 
Financial News, which requires us to extract 
the related temporal information from news. 
Temporal expressions in Chinese form a 
complex system. We cannot fully 
understand the temporal information only by 
extracting the verbs, adverbs, auxiliary 
words and temporal phrases. Instead, more 
profound analysis is needed. In this paper, 
we first introduce the temporal system of 
Chinese, then we put forward a method in 
dealing with Chinese temporal information, 
in which situation types is very important. 
Therefore, an algorithm is rendered to 
classify verbs into several situation types. 
1.1 Temporal System of Chinese 
Commonly, Chinese linguists \[3\]\[4\] 
think that the temporal system of Chinese 
includes three parts: phase, tense and aspect. 
Each of these represents ome profile of 
temporal expression (these definitions are a 
little different from linguistic theory of 
English). 
(1) Phase. A sentence may describe a static 
state or an action; an action may be durative 
or instantaneous; a durative action may 
indicate a terminal or not. All of these are 
the research fields of phase. So, static vs. 
dynamic, durative vs. instantaneous, telic vs. 
non-telic are three pairs of phase features. 
Phase depends fully on meaning. According 
to phase features, we can classify the verbs 
into different situation types. 
(2) Tense. Tense describes the relations 
between an event (E), reference time (R) and 
speaking time (S). First, taking S as the 
origin, we can get three reIations between R 
and S: if R is before S, the sentence 
describes past; if R is the same time as S, it 
describes present; if R is after S, it desci'ibes 
future. This is called primary tense. 
Secondly, we can get three relations 
between E and S: If E is before R, we call it 
anterior; if E is the same time as R, we call it 
simple; otherwise we call it posterior. This is 
called secondary tense. Therefore, there are 
nine tenses including anterior past, anterior 
future, simple future, posterior present, etc.

(3) Aspect . Aspect reflects the way we 
observe an event. For the same event, there 
are many perspectives. We can take the 
event as atomic and not consider its inner 
structure, and call it perfective. We can 
consider it being in process, and call it 
imperfective. For imperfective, we can 
observe it at a"position before it, at the 
beginning of it, in the middle of it, etc. 
Different perspectives lead to different 
expressions in the language. 
Phase, tense and aspect are not 
independent even though they are different 
conceptions; each of them can influence and 
restrict he others, ultimately building up the 
complex temporal system of Chinese. 
1.2 Phase-based Chinese temporal 
information analysis 
Most languages express temporal 
information through phase, tense and aspect, 
however, for different languages, the 
relative importance of the three parts is 
different. A very important feature of 
English is that tense and aspect are 
expressed by variation of predicates. But for 
Chinese, predicates keep the same form no 
matter how the tense and aspect are 
different. 
Therefore, in English, temporal 
information analysis mainly considers tense 
and aspect, as well as temporal adjective and 
time words and phrases. But in Chinese, 
tense and aspect of a sentence are not very 
clear, verbs do not vary in form with the 
change of tense and aspect. So we suggest 
basing temporal information analysis on 
phase. We mainly perceive the situation type 
of a sentence, then roughly acquire tense 
from adverbs and auxiliary words. After 
considering the temporal phrases, we can 
understand the temporal information of 
single event fully. Finally, according to the 
absolute temporal information of single 
event, we can get the temporal relation 
between two events. Phase-based temporal 
information analysis has been used in our 
research on Event Extraction from Financial 
News, in which the most important and 
fundamental problem is to acquire the 
situation types of a sentence. 
1.3 Situation Classification of Chinese 
Verbs 
In the West, research on situation has a 
long history. The earliest can be traced to 
the times of Aristotle. In resent years, 
Western researchers have published a large 
volume of papers, which present many 
points of view. The most important are 
Vendler(1967), Bache(1982), and Smith 
(1985) They approximately classify the 
situation as four types: 
state, activity, accomplishment, and 
achievement. 
Chinese researchers have also done 
considerable work, among which the most 
typical research were done by Chen\[3\] and 
Ma\[5\]. 
Ma\[5\] stated that the situation of a 
sentence is fully determined by the situation 
of the main verb of the sentence. He use 
three phases: static, durative, telic to classify 
verbs into four situational types 
V1,V2,V3,V4. 
Static Durative Telic 
VI + + + 
V2 + + 
V3 + 
V4 + 
Table 1.1 
Chen\[3\] stated that the situation of a 
sentence not only depends on the main verb 
of the sentence but also on other parts of the 
sentence. That is, although the main verb is 
the most important in determining a 
sentence situation, other parts such as 
adverbs also have effect. Cheri s 
classification is more detailed.

From the tables above, we can find that 
some words(such as (3) and (4) in table 1.3) 
can belong to more than one category, so 
Chen use modifiers, auxiliary words and 
prepositions to eliminate the ambiguity.

2. Our Classification Algorithm for 
Verbg Situation 
2.1 Guiding Thoughts 
(1) Our algorithm is for information 
processing 
eMa\[5\] uses three pairs of phase features in 
classifying, but from which we can not get 
an automatic classification algorithm for 
computers; the classification can only be 
done manually. 
eln linguistics, telicity is a phase feature 
used in classifying. In table 1.1 the 
difference between category V2 and V3, in 
table 1.3, the difference between "activivJ' 
and "accomplishmenf', are attributed to 
telicity. But in information process, we need 
not distinguish whether an event is telic or 
not. For example, 
Exp. 1 
~)~t\]~'j~, (He is playing the flute) 
'~ .  (He is playing a song '%iangzhu " )
Chen\[3\] thinks that in Exp. 1, the first 
sentence has the features: dynamicity, and 
durativity, and non-telicity; it belongs 
to "activi~' . The second sentence has the 
features dynamicity, durativity, and telicity, 
because in the second sentence, there is a 
default terminal . . . .  when the song 
~angzhd' is over, the action '~la~ is 
over, so the sentence belongs to 
'hccomplishmenf instead of  "activity. 
However we think such discrimination is 
useless for information extraction, because 
telicity is an ambiguous concept itself. What 
we need is to acquire the exact duration of 
the event. So if we knew the event is 
durative or not, and got the temporal 
phrases, we can know terminal time of the 
event. Besides, whether an event is telic or 
not can not be attributed to collocation and 
only can be done manually(as the exp 1 
shows). For these reasons, we consider the 
two verbs in Exp. 1 belonging to the same 
situational type, that is, we do not use 
talicity as a phase feature to classifying 
verbs. 
142 
(2) Separate classification of the verb 
situation from classification of the sentence 
situation. 
Chen\[3\] points that some verbs belong 
to more than one category, and gives a 
method to distinguish these cases. To make 
the ideal more clear, we use two steps to 
complete the seritence situation recognition. 
In this paper, we render an algorithm to 
classify verbs into different categories, 
which is the basis of another research ... .  
recognition of sentence situation, which will 
be discussed in future work. 
'Men(MentalityJ' can follow '~1~ (very). 
Verbs in the "AmlS' category can followed 
by "~-~(preposition-objec0' structures, etc. 
The following is the set of collocational 
features.

Table 2.1 
2.2 Classification Method 
We classify the verbs into five categories , 
Att(Attribute), Men(Mentality), Act 
(Activity) , Ins(Instantaneous) , Amb 
(Ambiguous). 
Att: ~(be), ~'(equal), '~'(include), m~(accord with) 
Men: ~.~J~(like), ~.,(belittle), ~(love), ~ff~ 
(be satisfied with) 
Act: ~(draw), ~l~l(gab), ~(drink), ~( run)  
In;  ~?~(explore), ~l;~(extinguish), I~(snap), 
(discovery) 
Amb: ~.~(sit), ~i(stand), Jig(lie), ~(kneel), ~:(bring), 
~(hang), ~(wear), ~-~(install) 
Amb(Ambiguous) include those words 
which describe different situations in 
different context. For example: 
Exp. 2: 
(they hung the picture on the wall. ) 
(Picture is hanging on the wall.) 
In Exp. 2, the two sentences have the 
same predicate '~  (hang). In the first 
sentence, '~  descnbes an instantaneous 
action, but the second sentence describes a
state. In English, forms of these two 
predicates are different; while in Chinese, 
they are the same. For this reason, we 
consider it ambiguous and indistinguishable 
without context. 
We have pointed out previously that 
phase depends only on meaning. However 
different situational types collocate with 
different words. So the essence of our 
algorithm is replace semantic judgement 
with collocational judgement. For example, 
2.3 Implementation of the algorithm 
According to table 2.1, a classification 
algorithm was designed, and we use two 
resources to implement our algorithm: The 
Contemporary Chinese Cihai \[11\] (which 
we will refer to as the Cihai below) 
dictionary and the Machine Tractable 
Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese 
Predicate Verbs \[12\](which we will refer to 
as the predicate dictionary below). The 
Cihai dictionary includes 12,000 entries and 
700,000 collocation instances, predicate 
dictionary includes about 3000 verbs with 
their semantic information, case relations 
and detailed collocation information. These 
two dictionaries both include some of the 
collocation information that the algorithm 
needs. 
Considenng the features of these two 
dictionaries, we adjust part of our algorithm: 
(1) In predicate dictionary, there is a slot 
named "verb typ? , which includes 
'transitive verlY , 'fntransifive verB' , 
~ttribufive verlS", 'linking vertt' etc. So, at 
the beginning of the algorithm, we judge if 
the verb is a "linking verlS' (
~(be~', ~(equa l~ '  ,etc) or a "possessive 
verlS' ('~-q~J' (have)). If it is, we directly 
classify the verb as "att(attribute~' without 
further processing. 
(2) The predicate dictionary provides the 
case relation of verbs, and their semantic 
ategodes. We restrict the agent of verbs in 
the "Men(mentality~' tobelong to one of: 
143 
"{ .)kI"(people), "{ )l,.,~} "(human), "1 
)l,~} "(multitude) , {~s:} 
(collectivity)'; "{:~:-~?~}(creatures)'; ,,~- ~,-ii,~,~,jtr 
bel ieff ,  "{gJJl~}(animal)" (3) Because 
Cihai includes collocation instances instead 
of collocation relations, we should consider 
synonyms. To be exact, when we determine 
whether a verb belongs to "Men(Mentality~' 
or not, we judge if it can follow 
(very) and synonyms such as 
'trY'P; 
However, some seldom seen instances were 
included. All these cause some errors. 
The final algorithm is as follows: 
if (a verb is labeled as" linking verb" or  '~:~ossessive vertf 
in predicate dictionary ) 
then the verb belongs to "Att(Attribute)" 
else if (the verb can follow ":~\[~"(very) and synonyms "~.~,I~", 
"1-?~"; '~l"~ '~71~2', "~" )  and (its agenf s 
semantic belongs to setl*) 
then the verb belongs to "Men(Mentality)" 
else if (it can follow ";t~E") or (be followed by"~") 
then if (it can be followed by "preposition-object" 
structure) 
then the verb belongs to "Amb(Ambiguous)" 
else the verb belongs to "Act(Activity)" 
else if (it can be followed by"T") 
then the verb belongs to"Ins(Instantaneous)" 
else the verb belongs tff unknown" 
*setl={human, multitude, collectivity, creatures, belief, 
animal }

Table 3.3 
3.2 Analysis 
We mainly analyze the errors: 
(1) Failure of algorithm 
Chinese .is a very complex language. 
Replacing semantic judgment by using 
collocations has limitation itself. For 
example, in most cases, whether a verb is 
durative or not can be decided by whether it 
can be used in such structure "verb-g ~"  (In 
most case, "~ represents an action in 
progress). But some instantaneous verbs 
such as ~.(knocky, can also be used in 
such structure to express a repeated action. 
(2) Errors caused by the resources 
(2.1) Collocation incompleteness in 
Cihai: for example, '~(d isagreeJ '  can 
collocate with '~  (very), but this 
collocation is not included in Cihai. 
(2.2)Errors caused by predicate dictionary: 
It is obvious that a certain proportion of 
dictionary errors is inevitable. For example, 
though '~  (beg) can follow '~i~E to 
represent the action is in progress, it is not 
included in the corresponding slot of 
predicate dictionary. 
(2.3) The inconsistency between the two 
dictionaries: For example, 
NN (admire), (mind), and ( 
belittle) are included in predicate dictionary 
but not in Cihai. Although ~ (regret) is 
included in Cihai, it is taken as an adjective 
instead of a verb. 
144 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we advance a phase-based 
method to analyze temporal information in 
Chinese. For this purpose, an algorithm is 
rendered to classify verbs into different 
situation types. Because a verl5 s situation 
depends on the meaning of the verb, the 
essence of our algorithm takes advantage of 
collocations to avoid semantics. The result 
shows the algorithm is successful. We also 
believe that if the errors caused by resources 
were eliminated, the result would be 
improved significantly. 
Although the five categories are defined 
by us, they can describe basic situations of 
Chinese. The classification algorithm itself 
is independent of resources, so it can be 
applied to other resources (dictionaries) if
these resources include sufficient collocation 
information. Furthermore, Discarding 
dictionaries and doing classification directly 
on large-scale real corpus, especially in 
certain domain, deserve the future research. 
Our algorithm is very useful for the 
future analysis of sentence situation for 
Information Extraction system and for 
dictionary construction.
