Abstract
This article provides an in-depth research of
machine learning methods for sentiment ana-
lysis of Czech social media. Whereas in En-
glish, Chinese, or Spanish this field has a
long history and evaluation datasets for vari-
ous domains are widely available, in case of
Czech language there has not yet been any
systematical research conducted. We tackle
this issue and establish a common ground for
further research by providing a large human-
annotated Czech social media corpus. Fur-
thermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art super-
vised machine learning methods for sentiment
analysis. We explore different pre-processing
techniques and employ various features and
classifiers. Moreover, in addition to our newly
created social media dataset, we also report re-
sults on other widely popular domains, such
as movie and product reviews. We believe
that this article will not only extend the current
sentiment analysis research to another family
of languages, but will also encourage competi-
tion which potentially leads to the production
of high-end commercial solutions.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis has become a mainstream re-
search field in the past decade. Its impact can be
seen in many practical applications, ranging from
analyzing product reviews (Stepanov and Riccardi,
2011) to predicting sales and stock markets using so-
cial media monitoring (Yu et al, 2013). The users?
opinions are mostly extracted either on a certain po-
larity scale, or binary (positive, negative); various
levels of granularity are also taken into account, e.g.,
document-level, sentence-level, or aspect-based sen-
timent (Hajmohammadi et al, 2012).
Most of the research in automatic sentiment ana-
lysis of social media has been performed in English
and Chinese, as shown by several recent surveys,
i.e., (Liu and Zhang, 2012; Tsytsarau and Palpanas,
2012). For Czech language, there have been very
few attempts, although the importance of sentiment
analysis of social media became apparent, i.e., dur-
ing the recent presidential elections 1. Many Czech
companies also discovered a huge potential in social
media marketing and started launching campaigns,
contests, and even customer support on Facebook?
the dominant social network of the Czech online
community with approximately 3.5 million users.2
However, one aspect still eludes many of them: au-
tomatic analysis of customer sentiment of products,
services, or even a brand or a company name. In
many cases, sentiment is still labeled manually, ac-
cording to our information from one of the leading
Czech companies for social media monitoring.
Automatic sentiment analysis in the Czech envi-
ronment has not yet been thoroughly targeted by the
research community. Therefore it is necessary to
create a publicly available labeled dataset as well as
to evaluate the current state of the art for two rea-
sons. First, many NLP methods must deal with high
flection and rich syntax when processing the Czech
language. Facing these issues may lead to novel

approaches to sentiment analysis as well. Second,
freely accessible and well-documented datasets, as
known from many shared NLP tasks, may stimulate
competition which usually leads to the production of
cutting-edge solutions.3
This article focuses on document-level sentiment
analysis performed on three different Czech datasets
using supervised machine learning. As the first
dataset, we created a Facebook corpus consisting
of 10,000 posts. The dataset was manually la-
beled by two annotators. The other two datasets
come from online databases of movie and prod-
uct reviews, whose sentiment labels were derived
from the accompanying star ratings from users of
the databases. We provide all these labeled datasets
under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence4
at http://liks.fav.zcu.cz/sentiment ,
together with the sources for all the presented exper-
iments.
The rest of this article is organized as follows.
Section 2 examines the related work with a focus
on the Czech research and social media. Section 3
thoroughly describes the datasets and the annotation
process. In section 4, we list the employed features
and describe our approach to classification. Finally,
section 5 contains the results with a thorough discus-
sion.
2 Related work
There are two basic approaches to sentiment ana-
lysis: dictionary-based and machine learning-based.
While dictionary-based methods usually depend on
a sentiment dictionary (or a polarity lexicon) and a
set of handcrafted rules (Taboada et al, 2011), ma-
chine learning-based methods require labeled train-
ing data that are later represented as features and
fed into a classifier. Recent attempts have also in-
vestigated semi-supervised methods that incorporate
auxiliary unlabeled data (Zhang et al, 2012).

dom Fields emerged from CoNLL-2003 named entity recogni-
tion shared task.

2.1 Supervised machine learning for sentiment
analysis
The key point of using machine learning for senti-
ment analysis lies in engineering a representative set
of features. Pang et al (2002) experimented with
unigrams (presence of a certain word, frequencies of
words), bigrams, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and ad-
jectives on a Movie Review dataset. Martineau and
Finin (2009) tested various weighting schemes for
unigrams based on TFIDF model (Manning et al,
2008) and proposed delta weighting for a binary sce-
nario (positive, negative). Their approach was later
extended by Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) who pro-
posed further improvement in delta TFIDF weight-
ing.
The focus of the current sentiment analysis re-
search is shifting towards social media, mainly tar-
geting Twitter (Kouloumpis et al, 2011; Pak and
Paroubek, 2010) and Facebook (Go et al, 2009;
Ahkter and Soria, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011; Lo?pez et
al., 2012). Analyzing media with very informal lan-
guage benefits from involving novel features, such
as emoticons (Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Montejo-
Ra?ez et al, 2012), character n-grams (Blamey et al,
2012), POS and POS ratio (Ahkter and Soria, 2010;
Kouloumpis et al, 2011), or word shape (Go et al,
2009; Agarwal et al, 2011).
In many cases, the gold data for training and test-
ing the classifiers are created semi-automatically, as
in, e.g., (Kouloumpis et al, 2011; Go et al, 2009;
Pak and Paroubek, 2010). In the first step, random
samples from a large dataset are drawn according to
presence of emoticons (usually positive and nega-
tive) and are then filtered manually. Although large
high-quality collections can be created very quickly
using this approach, it makes a strong assumption
that every positive or negative post must contain an
emoticon.
Balahur and Tanev (2012) performed experiments
with Twitter posts as part of the CLEF 2012 Re-
pLab5. They classified English and Spanish tweets
by a small but precise lexicon, which contained also
slang, combined with a set of rules that capture the
manner in which sentiment is expressed in social
media.

Since the limited space of this paper does not al-
low us to present detailed evaluation from the related
work, we recommend an in-depth survey by Tsytsa-
rau and Palpanas (2012) for actual results obtained
from the abovementioned methods.
2.2 Sentiment analysis in Czech environment
Veselovska? et al (2012) presented an initial research
on Czech sentiment analysis. They created a corpus
which contains polarity categories of 410 news sen-
tences. They used the Naive Bayes classifier and
a classifier based on a lexicon generated from an-
notated data. The corpus is not publicly available,
moreover, due to the small size of the corpus no
strong conclusions can be drawn.
Steinberger et al (2012) proposed a semi-
automatic ?triangulation? approach to creating sen-
timent dictionaries in many languages, including
Czech. They first produced high-level gold-standard
sentiment dictionaries for two languages and then
translated them automatically into the third lan-
guage by a state-of-the-art machine translation ser-
vice. Finally, the resulting sentiment dictionaries
were merged by taking overlap from the two auto-
matic translations.
A multilingual parallel news corpus annotated
with opinions towards entities was presented in
(Steinberger et al, 2011). Sentiment annotations
were projected from one language to several others,
which saved annotation time and guaranteed compa-
rability of opinion mining evaluation results across
languages. The corpus contains 1,274 news sen-
tences where an entity (the target of the sentiment
analysis) occurs. It contains 7 languages including
Czech. Their research targets fundamentally differ-
ent objectives from our research as they focus on
news media and aspect-based sentiment analysis.
3 Datasets
3.1 Social media dataset
The initial selection of Facebook brand pages for our
dataset was based on the ?top? Czech pages, accord-
ing to the statistics from SocialBakers.6 We focused
on pages with a large Czech fan base and a sufficient
number of Czech posts. Using Facebook Graph API
6http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-pages/
brands/czech-republic/
and Java Language Detector7 we acquired 10,000
random posts in the Czech language from nine dif-
ferent Facebook pages. The posts were then com-
pletely anonymized as we kept only their textual
contents.
Sentiment analysis of posts at Facebook brand
pages usually serves as a marketing feedback of user
opinions about brands, services, products, or current
campaigns. Thus we consider the sentiment target
to be the given product, brand, etc. Typically, users?
complaints hold negative sentiment, whereas joy or
happiness about the brand is taken as positive. We
also added another class called bipolar which rep-
resents both positive and negative sentiment in one
post.8 In some cases, the user?s opinion, although
being somehow positive, does not relate to the given
page.9 Therefore the sentiment is treated as neutral
in these cases, according to our above-mentioned as-
sumption.
The complete 10k dataset was independently an-
notated by two annotators. The inter-annotator
agreement (Cohen?s ?) between these two anno-
tators reaches 0.66 which represents a substantial
agreement level (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2013),
therefore the task can be considered as well-defined.
The gold data were created based on the agree-
ment of the two annotators. They disagreed in
2,216 cases. To solve these conflicts, we involved
a third super-annotator to assign the final sentiment
label. However, even after the third annotator?s la-
beling, there was still no agreement for 308 labels.
These cases were later solved by a fourth annotator.
We discovered that most of these conflicting cases
were classified as either neutral or bipolar. These
posts were often difficult to label because the author
used irony, sarcasm or the context or previous posts.
These issues remain open.
The Facebook dataset contains of 2,587 positive,
5,174 neutral, 1,991 negative, and 248 bipolar posts,
respectively. We ignore the bipolar class later in all
experiments. The sentiment distribution among the

reveal negative opinions towards cell phone oper-
ators and positive opinions towards, e.g., perfumes
and ZOO.

3.2 Movie review dataset
Movie reviews as a corpus for sentiment analysis
has been used in research since the pioneering re-
search conducted by Pang et al (2002). Therefore
we covered the same domain in our experiments as
well. We downloaded 91,381 movie reviews from
the Czech Movie Database10 and split them into 3
categories according to their star rating (0?2 stars as
negative, 3?4 stars as neutral, 5?6 stars as positive).
The dataset contains of 30,897 positive, 30,768 neu-
tral, and 29,716 negative reviews, respectively.
3.3 Product review dataset
Another very popular domain for sentiment analy-
sis deals with product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).
We crawled all user reviews from a large Czech e-
shop Mall.cz11 which offers a wide range of prod-
ucts. The product reviews are accompanied with star
ratings on the scale 0?5. We took a different strat-
egy for assigning sentiment labels. Whereas in the
movie dataset the distribution of stars was rather uni-
form, in the product review domain the ratings were
skewed towards the higher values. After a manual
inspection we discovered that 4-star ratings mostly
correspond to neutral opinions and 3 or less stars de-
note mostly negative comments. Thus we split the
10http://www.csfd.cz/
11http://www.mall.cz
dataset into three categories according to this obser-
vation. The final dataset consists of 145,307 posts
(102,977 positive, 31,943 neutral, and 10,387 nega-
tive).
4 Classification
4.1 Preprocessing
As pointed out by Laboreiro et al (2010), tokeniza-
tion significantly affects sentiment analysis, espe-
cially in case of social media. Although Ark-tweet-
nlp tool (Gimpel et al, 2011) was developed and
tested in English, it yields satisfactory results in
Czech as well, according to our initial experiments
on the Facebook corpus. Its significant feature is
proper handling of emoticons and other special char-
acter sequences that are typical for social media.
Furthermore, we remove stopwords using the stop-
word list from Apache Lucene project.12
In many NLP applications, a very popular pre-
processing technique is stemming. We tested Czech
light stemmer (Dolamic and Savoy, 2009) and High
Precision Stemmer13. Another widely-used method
for reducing the vocabulary size, and thus the feature
space, is lemmatization. For Czech language the
only currently available lemmatizer is shipped with
Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) toolkit (Hajic?
et al, 2006). However, we use our in-house Java
HMM-based implementation using the PDT train-
ing data as we need a better control over each pre-
processing step.
Part-of-speech tagging is done using our in-house
Java solution that exploits Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) data as well. However, since PDT is
trained on news corpora, we doubt it is suitable for
tagging social media that are written in very infor-
mal language (consult, i.e., (Gimpel et al, 2011)
where similar issues were tackled in English).
Since the Facebook dataset contains a huge num-
ber of grammar mistakes and misspellings (typ-
ically ?i/y?,?e?/je/ie?, and others), we incorporated
phonetic transcription to International Phonetic Al-
phabet (IPA) in order to reduce the effect of these
mistakes. We rely on eSpeak14 implementation. An-

other preprocessing step might involve removing di-
acritics, as many Czech users type only using unac-
cented characters. However, posts without diacritics
represent only about 8% of our datasets, thus we de-
cided to keep diacritics unaffected.
The complete preprocessing diagram and its vari-
ants is depicted in Table 1. Overall, there are 10
possible preprocessing ?pipe? configurations.
4.2 Features
N-gram features We use presence of unigrams
and bigrams as binary features. The feature space is
pruned by minimum n-gram occurrence which was
empirically set to 5. Note that this is the baseline
feature in most of the related work.
Character n-gram features Similarly to the word
n-gram features, we added character n-gram fea-
tures, as proposed by, e.g., (Blamey et al, 2012). We
set the minimum occurrence of a particular charac-
ter n-gram to 5, in order to prune the feature space.
Our feature set contains 3-grams to 6-grams.
POS-related features Direct usage of part-of-
speech n-grams that would cover sentiment patterns
has not shown any significant improvement in the re-
lated work. Still, POS tags provide certain character-
istics of a particular post. We implemented various
POS features that include, e.g., the number of nouns,
verbs, and adjectives (Ahkter and Soria, 2010), the
ratio of nouns to adjectives and verbs to adverbs
(Kouloumpis et al, 2011), and number of negative
verbs.
Emoticons We adapted the two lists of emoticons
that were considered as positive and negative from
(Montejo-Ra?ez et al, 2012). The feature captures
number of occurrences of each class of emoticons
within the text.
Delta TFIDF variants for binary scenarios Al-
though simple binary word features (presence of a
certain word) reach surprisingly good performance,
they have been surpassed by various TFIDF-based
weighting, such as Delta TFIDF (Martineau and
Finin, 2009), or Delta BM25 TFIDF (Paltoglou and
Thelwall, 2010). Delta-TFIDF still uses traditional
TFIDF word weighting but treats positive and nega-
tive documents differently. However, all the exist-
ing related works which use this kind of features
deal only with binary decisions (positive/negative),
thus we filtered out neutral documents from the
datasets.15 We implemented the most promising
weighting schemes from (Paltoglou and Thelwall,
2010), namely Augmented TF, LogAve TF, BM25
TF, Delta Smoothed IDF, Delta Prob. IDF, Delta
Smoothed Prob. IDF, and Delta BM25 IDF.
4.3 Classifiers
All evaluation tests were performed using two clas-
sifiers, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Support
Vector Machines (SVM). Although Naive Bayes
classifier is also widely used in the related work, we
did not include it as it usually performs worse than
SVM or MaxEnt. We used a pure Java framework
for machine learning16 with default settings (linear
kernel for SVM).
5 Results
For each combination from the preprocessing
pipeline (refer to Table 1) we assembled various sets
of features and employed two classifiers. In the first
15Opposite to leave-one-out cross validation in (Paltoglou
and Thelwall, 2010), we still use 10-fold cross validation in all
experiments.

scenario, we classify into all three classes (positive,
negative, and neutral).17 In the second scenario,
we follow a strand of related research, e.g., (Mar-
tineau and Finin, 2009; Celikyilmaz et al, 2010),
that deals only with positive and negative classes.
For these purposes we filtered out all the neutral doc-
uments from the datasets. Furthermore, in this sce-
nario we evaluate only features based on weighted
delta-TFIDF, as, e.g., in (Paltoglou and Thelwall,
2010). We also involved only MaxEnt classifier into
the second scenario.
All tests were conducted in the 10-fold cross val-
idation manner. We report macro F-measure, as
it allows comparing classifier results on different
datasets. Moreover, we do not report micro F-
measure (accuracy) as it tends to prefer performance
on dominant classes in highly unbalanced datasets
(Manning et al, 2008), which is, e.g., the case of
our Product Review dataset where most of the labels
are positive.
5.1 Social media
Table 2 shows the results for the 3-class classifica-
tion scenario on the Facebook dataset. The row la-
bels denote the preprocessing configuration accord-
ing to Table 1. In most cases, maximum entropy
classifier significantly outperforms SVM. The com-
bination of all features (the last column) yields the
best results regardless to the preprocessing steps.
The reason might be that the involved character n-
gram feature captures subtle sequences which repre-
sent subjective punctuation or emoticons, that were
not covered by the emoticon feature. On average,
the best results were obtained when HPS stemmer
and lowercasing or phonetic transcription were in-
volved (lines ShCl and ShPe). This configuration
significantly outperforms other preprocessing tech-
niques for token-based features (see column Unigr
+ bigr + POS + emot.).
In the second scenario we evaluated various
TFIDF weighting schemes for binary sentiment
classification. The results are shown in Table 3.
The three-character notation consists of term fre-
quency, inverse document frequency, and normal-
ization. Due to a large number of possible combi-
nations, we report only the most successful ones,

namely Augmented?a and LogAve?L term fre-
quency, followed by Delta Smoothed??(t?), Delta
Smoothed Prob.??(p?), and Delta BM25??(k)
inverse document frequency; normalization was not
involved. We can see that the baseline (the first col-
umn bnn) is usually outperformed by any weighted
TFIDF technique. Moreover, using any kind of
stemming (the row entitled various*) significantly
improves the results. For the exact formulas of the
delta TFIDF variants please refer to (Paltoglou and
Thelwall, 2010).
We also tested the impact of TFIDF word fea-
tures when added to other features from the first sce-
nario (refer to Table 2). Column FS1 in Table 3 dis-
plays results for a feature set with the simple binary
presence-of-the-word feature (binary unigrams). In
the last column FS2 we replaced this binary feature
with TFIDF weighted feature a?(t?)n. It turned out
that the weighed form of word feature does not im-
prove the performance, when compared with sim-
ple binary unigram feature. Furthermore, a set of
different features (words, bigrams, POS, emoticons,
character n-grams) significantly outperforms a sin-
gle TFIDF weighted feature.
We also report the effect of the dataset size on
the performance. We randomly sampled 10 subsets
from the dataset (1k, 2k, etc.) and tested the per-
formance; still using 10-fold cross validation. We
took the most promising preprocessing configura-
tion (ShCl) and MaxEnt classifier. As can be seen in
Figure 2, while the dataset grows to approx 6k?7k
items, the performance rises for most combinations
of features. At 7k-items dataset, the performance
begins to reach its limits for most combinations of
features and hence adding more data does not lead
to a significant improvement.
5.1.1 Upper limits of automatic sentiment
analysis
To see the upper limits of the task itself, we also
evaluate the annotator?s judgments. Although the
gold labels were chosen after a consensus of at least
two people, there were many conflicting cases that
must have been solved by a third or even a fourth
person. Thus even the original annotators do not
achieve 1.00 F-measure on the gold data.
We present ?performance? results of both annota-
tors and of the best system as well (MaxEnt classi-

the results as confusion matrices. For each class
(p?positive, n?negative, 0?neutral) we also re-
port precision, recall, and F-measure. The row head-
ings denote gold labels, the column headings repre-
sent values assigned by the annotators or the sys-
tem.18 The annotators? results show what can be ex-
pected from a ?perfect? system that would solve the
task the way a human would.
In general, both annotators judge all three classes
with very similar F-measure. By contrast, the sys-
tem?s F-measure is very low for negative posts (0.54
vs. ? 0.75 for neutral and positive). We offer the
following explanation. First, many of the negative
posts surprisingly contain happy emoticons, which
18Even though the task has three classes, the annotators also
used ?b? for ?bipolar and ??? for ?cannot decide?.

could be a misleading feature for the classifier. Sec-
ond, the language of the negative posts in not as ex-
plicit as for the positive ones in many cases; the neg-
ativity is ?hidden? in irony, or in a larger context (i.e.,
?Now I?m sooo satisfied with your competitor :))?).
This remains an open issue for the future research.
5.2 Product and movie reviews
For the other two datasets, the product reviews and
movie reviews, we slightly changed the configura-
tion. First, we removed the character n-grams from
the feature sets, otherwise the feature space would
become too large for feasible computing. Second,
we abandoned SVM as it became computationally
infeasible for such a large datasets.
Table 5 (left-hand part) presents results on the
product reviews. The combination of unigrams and
bigrams works best, almost regardless of the prepro-
cessing. By contrast, POS features rapidly decrease
the performance. We suspect that POS features do
not carry any useful information in this case and by
introducing a lot of ?noise? they cause that the op-
timization function in the MaxEnt classifier fails to
find a global minimum.
In the right-hand part of Table 5 we can see the
results on the movie reviews. Again, the bigram fea-
ture performs best, paired with combination of HPS
stemmer and phonetic transcription (ShPe). Adding
POS-related features causes a large drop in perfor-
mance. We can conclude that for larger texts, the
bigram-based feature outperforms unigram features
and, in some cases, a proper preprocessing may fur-
ther significantly improve the results.
6 Conclusion
This article presented an in-depth research of super-
vised machine learning methods for sentiment ana-
lysis of Czech social media. We created a large
Facebook dataset containing 10,000 posts, accom-
panied by human annotation with substantial agree-
ment (Cohen?s ? 0.66). The dataset is freely avail-
able for non-commercial purposes.19 We thoroughly
evaluated various state-of-the-art features and clas-
sifiers as well as different language-specific prepro-
cessing techniques. We significantly outperformed
the baseline (unigram feature without preprocess-
ing) in three-class classification and achieved F-
measure 0.69 using a combination of features (un-
igrams, bigrams, POS features, emoticons, charac-
ter n-grams) and preprocessing techniques (unsu-
pervised stemming and phonetic transcription). In
addition, we reported results in two other domains
(movie and product reviews) with a significant im-
provement over the baseline.
To the best of our knowledge, this article is the
only of its kind that deals with sentiment analysis
in Czech social media in such a thorough manner.
Not only it uses a dataset that is magnitudes larger
than any from the related work, but also incorporates
state-of-the-art features and classifiers. We believe
that the outcomes of this article will not only help
to set the common ground for sentiment analysis for
the Czech language but also help to extend the re-
search outside the mainstream languages in this re-
search field.
