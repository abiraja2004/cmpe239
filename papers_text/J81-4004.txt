Technical Correspondence 
On the  Need for  Pars ing  I l l - Formed Input 
Kwasny and Sondheimer (1981) present echniques 
for handling several types of il l-formed input within 
the context of augmented transition networks. Such 
approaches are necessary if natural language under- 
standing systems are to handle the full range of input 
to be expected from users. We present here some 
statistics which illustrate the magnitude of this prob- 
lem; almost one third of the queries collected in a 
natural language processing 
1981) contain problems of the

of il l-formed input: (1) 
co-occurrence violations, (2) ellipsis and extraneous 
terms, and (3) conjunction. A co-occurrence violation 
results from a problem such as lack of agreement. 
Ellipsis is the omission of some of the words required 
for a complete sentence; this problem is grouped to- 
gether with the problem of extraneous terms, in which 
unnecessary words are used. The use of conjunction is 
not ungrammatical, but it is included in their classifica- 
tion because similar techniques can be used to handle 
it. 
Kwasny and Sondheimer present limited evidence 
which indicates the importance of these problems. 
However, different studies are cited for each of the 
three problem classes, and not all of them are from the 
context of natural language understanding systems. 
In an experiment designed to test the influence of 
experience level on the types of queries posed to a 
natural language understanding system, three groups of 
student subjects were asked to compose simple English 
sentences requesting personnel information from a 
database. Since many of the 693 queries collected 
were not complete sentences in standard English, the 
types of errors made were analyzed. 
Co-occurrence violations were found in 12.3% of 
the queries. The most common such problems were 
incorrectly formed possessives and lack of agreement 
between subject and verb. Extraneous terms and el- 
lipsis were observed in 14.0% of the queries; the use 
of ellipsis was far more common than the appearance 
of extraneous terms. Conjunctions were found in 
11.4% of the queries. At least one of these problems 
was found in 32.8% of the queries. A more detailed 
breakdown is given in the following table. (It should 
be noted that these categories are not mutually exclu- 
sive.)
