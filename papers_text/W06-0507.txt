Abstract
In this paper, we describe a rote extrac-
tor that learns patterns for finding seman-
tic relations in unrestricted text, with new
procedures for pattern generalisation and
scoring. An improved method for estimat-
ing the precision of the extracted patterns
is presented. We show that our method ap-
proximates the precision values as evalu-
ated by hand much better than the proce-
dure traditionally used in rote extractors.
1 Introduction
With the large growth of the information stored in
the web, it is necessary to have available automatic
or semi-automatic tools so as to be able to process
all this web content. Therefore, a large effort has
been invested in developing automatic or semi-
automatic techniques for locating and annotating
patterns and implicit information from the web,
a task known as Web Mining. In the particular
case of web content mining, the aim is automati-
cally mining data from textual web documents that
can be represented with machine-readable seman-
tic formalisms such as ontologies and semantic-
web languages.
Recently, there is an increasing interest in au-
tomatically extracting structured information from
large corpora and, in particular, from the Web
(Craven et al, 1999). Because of the character-
istics of the web, it is necessary to develop effi-
cient algorithms able to learn from unannotated
data (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland,
1999; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005). New types of
web content such as blogs and wikis, are also a

source of textual information that contain an un-
derlying structure from which specialist systems
can benefit.
Consequently, rote extractors (Brin, 1998;
Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and
Hovy, 2002) have been identified as an appropri-
ate method to look for textual contexts that happen
to convey a certain relation between two concepts.
In this paper, we describe a new procedure for es-
timating the precision of the patterns learnt by a
rote extractor, and how it compares to previous ap-
proaches. The solution proposed opens new pos-
sibilities for improving the precision of the gener-
ated patterns, as described below.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2
describe related work; Section 3 and 4 describe the
proposed procedure and its evaluation, and Sec-
tion 5 presents the conclusions and future work.

Extracting information using Machine Learning
algorithms has received much attention since
the nineties, mainly motivated by the Message
Understanding Conferences. From the mid-
nineties, there are systems that learn extraction
patterns from partially annotated and unannotated
data (Huffman, 1995; Riloff, 1996; Riloff and
Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland, 1999).
Generalising textual patterns (both manually
and automatically) for the identification of rela-
tions has been proposed since the early nineties
(Hearst, 1992), and it has been applied to extend-
ing ontologies with hyperonymy and holonymy re-
lations (Morin and Jacquemin, 1999; Kietz et al,
2000; Cimiano et al, 2004; Berland and Char-
niak, 1999). Finkelstein-Landau andMorin (1999)
learn patterns for company merging relations with
exceedingly good accuracies. Recently, kernel
49
methods are also becoming widely used for rela-
tion extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhao
and Grishman, 2005).
Concerning rote extractors from the web, they
have the advantage that the training corpora can
be collected easily and automatically, so they
are useful in discovering many different relations
from text. Several similar approaches have been
proposed (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano,
2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), with vari-
ous applications: Question-Answering (Ravichan-
dran and Hovy, 2002), multi-document Named
Entity Coreference (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003),
and generating biographical information (Mann
and Yarowsky, 2005). Szpektor et al (2004) ap-
plies a similar, with no seed lists, to extract auto-
matically entailment relationships between verbs,
and Etzioni et al (2005) report very good results
extracting Named Entities and relationships from
the web.
2.1 Rote extractors
Rote extractors (Mann and Yarowsky, 2005) es-
timate the probability of a relation r(p, q) given
the surrounding context A1pA2qA3. This is cal-
culated, with a training corpus T , as the number
of times that two related elements r(x, y) from T
appear with that same contextA1xA2yA3, divided
by the total number of times that x appears in that
context together with any other word:
P (r(p, q)|A1pA2qA3) =
P
x,yr c(A1xA2yA3)
P
x,z c(A1xA2zA3)
(1)
x is called the hook, and y the target. In order to
train a Rote extractor from the web, this procedure
is mostly used (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002):
1. Select a pair of related elements to be used
as seed. For instance, (Dickens,1812) for the
relation birth year.
2. Submit the query Dickens AND 1812 to a
search engine, and download a number of
documents to build the training corpus.
3. Keep all the sentences containing both ele-
ments.
4. Extract the set of contexts between them and
identify repeated patterns. This may just be
the m characters to the left or to the right
(Brin, 1998), the longest common substring
of several contexts (Agichtein and Gravano,
2000), or all substrings obtained with a suf-
fix tree constructor (Ravichandran and Hovy,
2002).
5. Download a separate corpus, called hook cor-
pus, containing just the hook (in the example,
Dickens).
6. Apply the previous patterns to the hook cor-
pus, calculate the precision of each pattern
in the following way: the number of times it
identifies a target related to the hook divided
by the total number of times the pattern ap-
pears.
7. Repeat the procedure for other examples of
the same relation.
To illustrate this process, let us suppose that we
want to learn patterns to identify birth years. We
may start with the pair (Dickens, 1812). From the
downloaded corpus, we extract sentences such as
Dickens was born in 1812
Dickens (1812 - 1870) was an English writer
Dickens (1812 - 1870) wrote Oliver Twist
The system identifies that the contexts of the last
two sentences are very similar and chooses their
longest common substring to produce the follow-
ing patterns:
<hook> was born in <target>
<hook> ( <target> - 1870 )
The rote extractor needs to estimate automati-
cally the precision of the extracted patterns, in or-
der to keep the best ones. So as to measure these
precision values, a hook corpus is now down-
loaded using the hook Dickens as the only query
word, and the system looks for appearances of the
patterns in this corpus. For every occurrence in
which the hook of the relation is Dickens, if the
target is 1812 it will be deemed correct, and oth-
erwise it will be deemed incorrect (e.g. in Dickens
was born in Portsmouth).
3 Our proposal
3.1 Motivation
In a rote extractor as described above, we believe
that the procedure for calculating the precision of
the patterns may be unreliable in some cases. For
example, the following patterns are reported by
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) for identifying the
relations Inventor, Discoverer and Location:
Relation Prec. Pattern
Inventor 1.0 <target> ?s <hook> and
Inventor 1.0 that <target> ?s <hook>
Discoverer 0.91 of <target> ?s <hook>
Location 1.0 <target> ?s <hook>
In the particular application in which they are
used (relation extraction for Question Answering),
they are useful because there is initially a ques-
tion to be answered that indicates whether we are
50
looking for an invention, a discovery or a location.
However, if we want to apply them to unrestricted
relation extraction, we have the problem that the
same pattern, the genitive construction, represents
all these relations, apart from the most common
use indicating possession.
If patterns like these are so ambiguous, then
why do they receive so high a precision estimate?
One reason is that the patterns are only evalu-
ated for the same hook for which they were ex-
tracted. To illustrate this with an example, let
us suppose that we obtain a pattern for the rela-
tion located-at using the pairs (New York, Chrysler
Building). The genitive construction can be ex-
tracted from the context New York?s Chrysler
Building. Afterwards, when estimating the pre-
cision of this pattern, only sentences containing
<target>?s Chrysler Building are taken into ac-
count. Because of this, most of the pairs extracted
by this pattern may extract the target New York,
apart from a few that extract the name of the ar-
chitect that built it, van Allen. Thus we can expect
that the genitive pattern will receive a high preci-
sion estimate as a located-at pattern.
For our purposes, however, we want to collect
patterns for several relations such as writer-book,
painter-picture, director-film, actor-film, and we
want to make sure that the obtained patterns are
only applicable to the desired relation. Patterns
like <target> ?s <hook> are very likely to be ap-
plicable to all of these relations at the same time,
so we would like to be able to discard them auto-
matically by assigning them a low precision.
3.2 Suggested improvements
Therefore, we propose the following three im-
provements to this procedure:
1. Collecting not only a hook corpus but also a
target corpus should help in calculating the
precision. In the example of the Chrysler
building, we have seen that in most cases
that we look for the pattern ?s Chrysler build-
ing the previous words are New York, and
so the pattern is considered accurate. How-
ever, if we look for the pattern New York?s,
we shall surely find it followed by many dif-
ferent terms representing different relations,
and the precision estimate will decrease.
2. Testing the patterns obtained for one relation
using the hook and target corpora collected
for other relations. For instance, if the geni-
tive construction has been extracted as a pos-
sible pattern for the writer-book relation, and
we apply it to a corpus about painters, the rote
extractor can detect that it also extracts pairs
with painters and paintings, so that particular
pattern will not be very precise for that rela-
tion.
3. Many of the pairs extracted by the patterns
in the hook corpora were not evaluated at all
when the hook in the extracted pair was not
present in the seed lists. To overcome this,
we propose to use the web to check whether
the extracted pair might be correct, as shown
below.
3.3 Algorithm
In our implementation, the rote extractor starts
with a table containing some information about the
relations for which we want to learn patterns. This
procedure needs a little more information than just
the seed list, which is provided as a table in the
format displayed in Table 1. The data provided for
each relation is the following: (a) The name of the
relation, used for naming the output files contain-
ing the patterns; (b) the name of the file contain-
ing the seed list; (c) the cardinality of the relation.
For instance, given that many people can be born
on the same year, but for every person there is just
one birth year, the cardinality of the relation birth
year is n:1; (d) the restrictions on the hook and
the target. These can be of the following three cat-
egories: unrestricted, if the pattern can extract any
sequence of words as hook or target of the relation,
Entity, if the pattern can extract as hook or target
only things of the same entity type as the words
in the seed list (as annotated by the NERC mod-
ule), or PoS, if the pattern can extract as hook or
target any sequence of words whose sequence of
PoS labels was seen in the training corpus; and (e)
a sequence of queries that could be used to check,
using the web, whether an extracted pair is correct
or not.
We assume that the system has used the seed list
to extract and generalise a set of patterns for each
of the relations using training corpora (Ravichan-
dran and Hovy, 2002; Alfonseca et al, 2006a).
Our procedure for calculating the patterns? preci-
sions is as follows:
1. For every relation,
(a) For every hook, collect a hook corpus
from the web.
51
Relation name Seed-list Cardinality Hook-type Target-type Web queries
birth year birth-date.txt n:1 entity entity $1 was born in $2
death year death-date.txt n:1 entity entity $1 died in $2
birth place birth-place.txt n:1 entity entity $1 was born in $2
country-capital country-capital.txt 1:1 entity entity $2 is the capital of $1
author-book author-book.txt n:n entity unrestricted $1 is the author of $2
director-film director-film.txt 1:n entity unrestricted $1 directed $2, $2 directed by $1
Table 1: Example rows in the input table for the system.
(b) For every target, collect a target corpus
from the web.
2. For every relation r,
(a) For every pattern P , collected during
training, apply it to every hook and tar-
get corpora to extract a set of pairs.
For every pair p = (ph, pt),
? If it appears in the seed list of r, con-
sider it correct.
? If it appears in the seed list of other
relation, consider it incorrect.
? If the hook ph appears in the seed list
of r with a different target, and the
cardinality is 1:1 or n:1, consider it
incorrect.
? If the target pt appears in r?s seed list
with a different hook, and the cardi-
nality is 1:1 or 1:n, incorrect.
? Otherwise, the seed list does not
provide enough information to eval-
uate p, so we perform a test on the
web. For every query provided for r,
the system replaces $1 with ph and
$2 with pt, and sends the query to
Google. The pair is deemed correct
if and only if there is at least one an-
swer.
The precision of P is estimated as the
number of extracted pairs that are sup-
posedly correct divided by the total
number of pairs extracted.
In this step, every pattern that did not apply at
least twice in the hook and target corpora is also
discarded.
3.4 Example
After collecting and generalising patterns for
the relation director-film, we apply each pat-
tern to the hook and target corpora collected
for every relation. Let us suppose that we
want to estimate the precision of the pattern
<target> ?s <hook>
and we apply it to the hook and the target cor-
pora for this relation and for author-book. Pos-
sible pairs extracted are (Woody Allen, Bananas),
(Woody Allen, Without Fears), (Charles Dickens,
A Christmas Carol). Only the first one is correct.
The rote extractor proceeds as follows:
? The first pair appears in the seed list, so it is
considered correct.
? Although Woody Allen appears as hook in the
seed list andWithout Fears does not appear as
target, the second pair is still not considered
incorrect because the directed-by relation has
n:n cardinality.
? The third pair appears in the seed list for
writer-book, so it is directly marked as incor-
rect.
? Finally, because still the system has not made
a decision about the second pair, it queries
Google with the sequences
Woody Allen directed Without Fears
Without Fears directed by Woody Allen
Because neither of those queries provide any
answer, it is considered incorrect.
In this way, it can be expected that the patterns
that are equally applicable to several relations,
such as writer-book, director-film or painter-
picture will attain a low precision because they
will extract many incorrect relations from the cor-
pora corresponding to the other relations.
4 Experiment and results
4.1 Rote extractor settings
The initial steps of the rote extractor follows the
general approach: downloading a training cor-
pus using the seed list and extracting patterns.
The training corpora are processed with a part-
of-speech tagger and a module for Named Entity
Recognition and Classification (NERC) that anno-
tates people, organisations, locations, dates, rela-
tive temporal expressions and numbers (Alfonseca
et al, 2006b), so this information can be included
in the patterns. Furthermore, for each of the terms
in a pair in the training corpora, the system also

stores in a separate file the way in which they are
annotated in the training corpus: the sequences of
part-of-speech tags of every appearance, and the
entity type (if marked as such). So, for instance,
typical PoS sequences for names of authors are
?NNP?1 (surname) and ?NNP NNP? (first name
and surname). A typical entity kind for an author
is person.
In the case that a pair from the seed list is found
in a sentence, a context around the two words in
the pair is extracted, including (a) at most five
words to the left of the first word; (b) all the
words in between the pair words; (c) at most five
words to the right of the second word. The context
never jumps over sentence boundaries, which are
marked with the symbols BOS (Beginning of sen-
tence) and EOS (End of sentence). The two related
concepts are marked as <hook> and <target>.
Figure 1 shows several example contexts extracted
for the relations birth year, birth place, writer-
book and country-capital city.
The approach followed for the generalisation
is the one described by (Alfonseca et al, 2006a;
Ruiz-Casado et al, in press), which has a few
modifications with respect to Ravichandran and
Hovy (2002)?s, such as the use of the wildcard * to
represent any sequence of words, and the addition
of part-of-speech and Named Entity labels to the
patterns.
The input table has been built with the fol-
lowing nineteen relations: birth year, death year,
birth place, death place, author?book, actor?
film, director?film, painter?painting, Employee?
organisation, chief of state, soccer player?team,

quired to build the table and the seed lists was less
than one person-day, as some of the seed lists were
directly collected from web pages.
For each step, the following settings have been
set:
? The size of the training corpus has been set
to 50 documents for each pair in the original
seed lists. Given that the typical sizes of the
lists collected are between 50 and 300 pairs,
this means that several thousand documents
are downloaded for each relation.
? Before the generalisation step, the rote ex-
tractor discards those patterns in which the
hook and the target are too far away to each
other, because they are usually difficult to
generalise. The maximum allowed distance

all the patterns resulting from the generalisa-
tion of existing ones contain wildcards adja-
cent to either the hook or the target.
? For the precision estimation, for each pair in
the seed lists, 50 documents are collected for
the hook and other 50 for the target. Because
of time constraints, and given that the total
size of the hook and the target corpora ex-
ceeds 100,000 documents, for each pattern a
sample of 250 documents is randomly cho-
sen and the patterns are applied to it. This
sample is built randomly but with the fol-
lowing constraints: there should be an equal
amount of documents selected from the cor-
pora from each relationship; and there should
be an equal amount of documents from hook
corpora and from target corpora.
4.2 Output obtained
Table 2 shows the number of patterns obtained for
each relation. Note that the generalisation proce-
dure applied produces new (generalised) patterns
to the set of original patterns, but no original pat-
tern is removed, so they all are evaluated; this is
why the set of patterns increases after the gener-
alisation. The filtering criterion was to keep the
patterns that applied at least twice on the test cor-
pus.
It is interesting to see that for most relations the
reduction of the pruning is very drastic. This is
because of two reasons: Firstly, most patterns are
far too specific, as they include up to 5 words at
each side of the hook and the target, and all the
words in between. Only those patterns that have
generalised very much, substituting large portions
with wildcards or disjunctions are likely to apply
to the sentences in the hook and target corpora.
54
Secondly, the samples of the hook and target cor-
pora used are too small for some of the relations
to apply, so few patterns apply more than twice.
Note that, for some relations, the output of the
generalisation step contains less patterns that the
output of the initial extraction step: that is due to
the fact that the patterns in which the hook and
the target are not nearby were removed in between
these two steps.
Concerning the precision estimates, a full eval-
uation is provided for the birth-year relation. Ta-
ble 3 shows in detail the thirty patterns obtained.
It can also be seen that some of the patterns with
good precision contain the wildcard *. For in-
stance, the first pattern indicates that the presence
of any of the words biography, poetry, etc. any-
where in a sentence before a person name and a
date or number between parenthesis is a strong in-
dication that the target is a birth year.
The last columns in the table indicate the num-
ber of times that each rule applied in the hook and
target corpora, and the precision of the rule in each
of the following cases:
? As estimated by the complete program
(Prec1).
? As estimated by the traditional hook cor-
pus approach (Prec2). Here, cardinality is
not taken into account, patterns are evaluated
only on the hook corpora from the same rela-
tion, and those pairs whose hook is not in the
seed list are ignored.
? The real precision of the rule (real). In or-
der to obtain this metric, two different an-
notators evaluated the pairs applied indepen-
dently, and the precision was estimated from
the pairs in which they agreed (there was a
96.29% agreement, Kappa=0.926).
As can be seen, in most of the cases our procedure
produces lower precision estimates.
If we calculate the total precision of all the rules
altogether, shown in the last row of the table, we
can see that, without the modifications, the whole
set of rules would be considered to have a total
precision of 0.84, while that estimate decreases
sharply to 0.46 when they are used. This value
is nearer the precision of 0.54 evaluated by hand.
Although it may seem surprising that the precision
estimated by the new procedure is even lower than
the real precision of the patterns, as measured by
hand, that is due to the fact that the web queries
consider unknown pairs as incorrect unless they

appear in the web exactly in the format of the
query in the input table. Specially for not very
well-known people, we cannot expect that all of
them will appear in the web following the pattern
?X was born in date?, so the web estimates tend
to be over-conservative.
Table 4 shows the precision estimates for every
pair extracted with all the rules using both proce-
dures, with 0.95 confidence intervals. The real
precision has been estimating by sampling ran-
domly 200 pairs and evaluating them by hand, as
explained above for the birth year relation. As can
be observed, out of the 19 relations, the precision
estimate of the whole set of rules for 11 of them
is not statistically dissimilar to the real precision,
while that only holds for two relationships using
the previous approach.
Please note as well that the precisions indicated
in the table refer to all the pairs extracted by all the
rules, some of which are very precise, but some of
which are very imprecise. If the rules are to be
applied in an annotation system, only those with
a high precision estimate would be used, and ex-
pectedly much better overall results would be ob-
tained.
5 Conclusions and future work
We have described here a new procedure for es-
timating the precision of the patterns learnt by a
rote extractor that learns from the web. Compared
to other similar approaches, it has the following
improvements:
? For each pair (hook,target) in the seed list, a
target corpora is also collected (apart from
the hook corpora), and the evaluation is per-
formed using corpora from several relations.
55
This has been observed to improve the esti-
mate of the rule?s precision, given that the
evaluation pairs not only refer to the elements
in the seed list.
? The cardinality of the relations is taken into
consideration in the estimation process using
the seed list. This is important, for instance,
to be able to estimate the precision in n:n re-
lations like author-work, given that we can-
not assume that the only books written by
someone are those in the seed list.
? For those pairs that cannot be evaluated using
the seed list, a simple query to the Google
search engine is employed.
The precisions estimated with this procedure
are significantly lower than the precisions obtained
with the usual hook corpus approach, specially for
ambiguous patterns, and much near the precision
estimate when evaluated by hand.
Concerning future work, we plan to estimate the
precision of the patterns using the whole hook and
target corpora, rather than using a random sample.
A second objective we have in mind is not to throw
away the ambiguous patterns with low precision
(e.g. the possessive construction), but to train a
model so that we can disambiguate which is the
relation they are conveying in each context (Girju
et al, 2003).
