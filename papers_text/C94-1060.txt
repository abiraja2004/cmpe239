Summary 
In this paper, we show that  Reileralion and Collo- 
cation relations as introduced I)y I lal l iday and l lasan 
may function as lexieally I)iased discourse structure 
relations and that  these relations are well represented 
by sequences of Mel'&flds Lexical Funclions (Ll,'s). We 
propose to use Lie sequences for tl,e final determina- 
tion and realization of discourse organizat ion during 
lexical choice in text generation. 
1 LEXICAL PHENOMENA IN DIS- 
COURSE 
1.1 The Problem 
In text generation, the tmsk of content selection and 
discourse organizat ion,  i.e. text phuming, has often 
been opposed to the task of l inguistic realization ()1" the 
information selected and organized by the text plan- 
ning process (el., e.g., MeKeown and Swartout,  1987). 
However, discourse organizat ion is not possibh', with- 
out taking into account l inguistic means that  are avail- 
able to express a part icular  meaning (el., e.g., Meteer, 
1992; Rubinoff, 1992). Esl)e.eially the \['allure to in- 
tegrate lexical choice into the phuming process may 
lead to monotonous,  awkward, or even ungrammat i -  
cal text (note that  when used separately, the clauses 
in ( Ix) and (2a) are fully acceptable): '  
(I) a. ? Alle bewahrten Ruhe; nut llans holt- 
rite keine lbtlw/(sie nieht) \]~ew~bE,Lt!

not kee l) cahn'.

These examples show thai, lexicaI constraints are of 
a sl)e('ial relewmee to discourse org;mization if related 
discourse segments conmmnicate  illfOrlll&tiOll on lilt(! 
same or related object, event, process, etc. Whi le in 
the past, considerable work has been done on the real- 
ization of anaphor ic  links between related entit ies via 
referring expressions (ef., e.g., Tut in and Kittredge, 
1092; Dale, 1980; Relier, 1091), only a few pro\[)osals

the lexemes involved. For examl)le , ill (4), the second

Reiteration stands for a strict repetition on a lex- 
ieal expression in related discourse segments; for a 
substitution of a lexical expression by a synonym, or 
for a substitution by a snperordinate. Consider the 
following examples, which illustrate the three differ- 
ent reiteration relations (strict repetition in (7a), 
synonymy in (7b), and superord inat ion  in (7c)): 
(6) Last summer, Monica flew to Italy, 
(7) a. while Daniela flew to Norway. 
b. while Daniela took the plane to Nor- 
way. 
c. while Daniela travelled to Norway. 
Further substitution relations such as metaphor ic  
repet i t ion  (7d), negated  az~tonyray (7e), etc. can 
be added: 
(7) d. while Daniela wafted away to Norway. 
e. Daniela also did not stay at home. 
Collocation stands for 'any recognizable lezicose- 
mastic relation' between lexicM expressions in related 
discourse segments. Examples of collocation relations 
are a t t r ibut ion  (7f), par t i t ion  (7g), means (7h), 
etc.: 
(7) f. it was a very pleasant journey.  
g. making a stop over in Munich.  
It. it was one of those ~ifl aircrafts. 
As our examples how, reiteration and collocation 
relations help to ensure not only cohesion, but also 
coherence in texts. Therefore, a text generator has to 
provide an organization of lexical resources that tailors 
discourse structure relations to reiteration and collo- 
cation relations. This presupposes, on the one hand, 
a precise picture of which reiteration and collocation 
relations are available in language and how they are 
realizable; and, on the other hand, a fine-grained is- 
course model that contains these relations. 
To make allowance for the global discourse orga- 
nization, which is performed independently from lex- 
ical resources, we suggest a two level text planning 
task implementation, with the first level realized by a 
Rhetorical Struclure 7'heory (its'r) (M ann and Thomp- 
son, 1987) style text planner and the second level -- 
by a separate lexical choice module. Then, the dis- 
course organization of a text is done in two steps: 
in the first step, the text planner predetermines the 
discourse structure relations; in the second step, the 
lexical choice module provides, in accordance with lin- 
guistic constraints, the final determination and the re- 
alization of these discourse structure relations. 
The present paper reports an attempt o define lex- 
ieally biased discourse structure relations used in a 
partially implemented lexical choice module. I)ue to 
the lack of space, we do not discuss the module it- 
self; it is described in detail in (Wanner, 1992, 1994). 
Here, we demonstrate how discourse organization for 
text generation can be refined by lexically biased dis- 
course structure relations and how these relations are 
related to global discourse relations specified in the 
output of an RST style text planner. 
In contrast o the most discourse models (cf., e.g., 
McKeown, 1985; Ch'osz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and 
Thompson, 1987), which take the clause ~ts the min- 
imal discourse segment, we consider as discourse seg- 
ments "perspectives" (cf. McCoy, 1989) -  specific 
views taken on a semantic entity (an object, an ew~'nt, 
etc.). A perspective is a wording which is tailored to 
the lexical repertoire of an entity; it is realizable as a 
clause, a phrase, or as a single lexeme. Each of the 
clauses in the examples above can be considered as a 
realization of a single perspective; ~md the reiteration 
and collocation relations that hold between the clauses 
as well-defined perspective pairs. 
In our model, a single perspective is represented as a 
composition of Mel'&fl~'s Lexical l,~unctions (hereafter 
LFs) (Mel'&fl{ and Polgu~re, 11987); perspective pairs 
are represented as LI~' sequences. 
The lbllowing distinctive features characterize our 
model: 
? it makes snre that all relations defined ~tre ex- 
pressible in language, 
? it allows for a realization of lexicM relations as 
subclansal relations between discourse segments, 
? it is sensitive to lexical and syntactic wtriations \['or 
the realization of discourse structure relations. 
2 LEX ICAL  FUNCTIONS IN  D IS -

2 .1  The  Bas ics  
Formally speaking, an L~ f is a standard semantico- 
lexical relation which holds between a lexeme 1,1 (the 
keyword of f ) and a set of lexemes f(t,) (the wdue of 
f). Examples on LFs are: 
~yll:  ~synollynl ~ 
Anti: 'antonym' 
Gener: 'hyperonym' 
Figm': 'metaph. rep.' 
C(}IIV2I ', tcotlvel.SiOll~ 
So: 'situation' 
A0: 's ituational ~tdj.' 
Vo: 'action' 
Magn: 'intens@y)' 
Operl : 'perform' 
Incep: 'beginning' 
Fin: %rid' 
anus :  ~C~llsa tioll ~ 
Manlf: 'manifest~ttion'

debate)). 4
In text generation, the bettellts from l.t.'s are I, hree- 
fold: (i) they provide subclausal collocational con- 
straints l)etween the keywor<ls aiid the wdues (<:f. h:r: 
danskaja el al., 199 l) as, e.g., between narrow and ma- 
jo, ' i ty (with Ant iMagn(major i tv )  = narrot , )  i,, Ilo,,- 
dini  won with a nar row major i ty ;  (ii) they provide in- 
terclausal cooccurrenee links (el. 'l'utin and Kittredge, 
1992) between the keywords and ,,he wdues as, e.g., 
between spaghett i  and pasla (with Gener(spaghet l i )  = 
pasla) in Let's take spaghetti; pasta is not bad he.re; and 
(iii) they allow \['or explMt statement:s on tit('+ coo( 'eur -  
fence  between values orw~rious LFs ill relal;ed discourse 
segments, as, e.g., between the values of Vil(sler'p) - 
\[to\] sleep at,d h, cep(steep) -- \[to\] s i ,k i , l o  sl,,ep i,t 
l lardly in bed, 7bny  sank into sleep and slept all the 
night ti l l  the morn ing .  
In  our work, we use (i) for single perslmet.ive reatiza- 
l.ions (ef. Wanner and Bateman, 1990); ( i i )and (iii) 
serve for the representation of perspective sequences, 
i.e. reiteration and collocation relations in discourse. 
One such relation is giwm by all pairs Lt.'t A 1,1:2 ('I.F 
sequences') which show the same eooecurrenee behav- 
ior (e.g., the sequences ()pert A Operl and Vib A V0

2.3 Funct ional  Content  of LF Se-

Semantics, lexis, and syntax of LF sequences do not 
provide sufficient criteria for the choice of one sequence 
over all other comparable ones. These criteria nmst be 
provided by tile functional con lent we associate with 
each sequence (or reiteration and collocation relation, 
respectively). The flmctional content of tile reiteration

3 TOWARDS LEXICALLY B IASED 
DISCOURSE RELAT IONS 
Due to their functional content, El,' sequences erve. 
~s instantiations of individual discourse structure re- 
lations. In our work, we suggest hat these individual 
discourse structure relations can be organized cohe,'- 
ently in terms of the fimctions anti semantic distinc- 
tions they represent. In accordance with the claim 
that the availability of specific LF sequences i depen- 
dent on the entities the LFs are applied to, we furthex 
suggest hat this organization must be done individu- 
ally for each predicative ntity (el. Wanner, 1994). 
Based on this, we define taxonomies (one for 
each predicative ntity) which have been inspired by 
tlalliday's proposal for grouping interclausal logico- 
semantic relations (el. Ilalliday, 1985). l\[ow such an 
organization carl be realized efficiently using inheri- 
tance teclmiques is described in (Wanner, 1992). 
SThls is not to say that these functions are the only ones 
that are possible 
Although our model is not restricted to interclausal 
relations, two features o\[' lIalliday's proposal are wtlu- 
able to us: (i) that a Iogico-semantic relation 'expands' 
one wording by an another one rather than connecting 
two given wordings and (ii) that a logico-semantic re- 
lation can be further decomposed with respect, to its: 
1. semantics, 2. syntactic realization, 3. communica- 
tive structure, and 4. with respect to the speaker's 
intention, which motiw~tes the selection of this rela- 
tion during the text production process. 
In what follows, we discuss first the general taxon- 
omy of our 'expanding' discourse structure relations 
for processes and then the decomposition of the reh> 
tions along these four dimensions, l?ollowing the con- 
ventions in R.ST, we call the expanded part 'nucleus' 
and the expanding o,e 'satellite'. 
3.1 Taxonomy of Lexlcal Discourse Re- 
lations 
A taxonomy of lexical discourse, structure relations is 
to be understood as a hierarchy of alternative choices 
of increasingly delicate relations. The most delicate 
relations are I,F sequences represented by their func- 
tional content. The top level of the. taxonomy repre- 
sents, thus, the most global types of exI)ansion. In 
accordance with (llalliday, 1985), these are F, Lalm- 
RATION, MXTENSION, and I,\]NIIANCEMENT. ELAIt()I1.A- 
TION subsumes all those, expansions which ensure a 
deeper understanding of t,he meaning comnmnicated 
by the nucleus wording. A deeper understanding or
the nucleus wording is ensured by reslaling, refining, 
or clarifying it (the next level of ELABORATION in the 
taxonomy). For example, all reiteration relations are 
of the I,;LABORATION type. 
The EXTENSION expansions extend the meaning 
comnmnicated by tile nucleus wording. This can be 
(lone by introducing a new constituent that is related 
to what has linen said ill the nucleus, by adding a 
new action of I.he known constitueuts, etc. Beginning 
extens ion  is, e.g., an EXTENSION. 
The ENIIANCIi:MI,'NT expansions qualify the mean- 
lug conmmnieal.ed I)y tim nucleus wording by adding 
a reference o\[" causation, time., location, l;qanne.r, 
mode, etc. An example of F, NIIANCEMENT iv causa l  
enhancement. 
f igure 1 shows ill lllOl'e detail tile ELABORATION 
fragment of the taxonomy in network tbrm. Ac- 
cording to this figure, ILESTA'PI,3MENT can be real- 
ized as a conlraslive, a generalized, or as a repeal- 
ing reslalemenl, respectively. As shown ill Table 2, 
CONTII.ASTIVE RESTATEMENT corresponds to tile reit- 
eration negated antonymy, GENEItAL1ZING II.ESTATE- 
MENT to superord inat ion ,  respectively. ItEPl,',ATING 
RESTATI,;MENT is further insisting, clarifying, illustra- 
live, pictoresque, etc. (see again Table 2 for corre- 
sponding reiteration relations).

The lexieal choice process, which makes use or the 
discussed iscourse structure relation taxonomies, and 
tile representation r lexical resources arc described in 
detail in (Wanner, 1992, 1994). lh, re we focus on the 
interface between the first, level text planning and the 
lexical choice n|odule; and ou the output as prodt|ced 
hy the lexieal choice n|odule. 
The ecmllmlatioual fr;mu~work in which our model 
has part ial ly been implemeI|tcd, is the systet||ic text 
gc|lerator KOMI,:'I' (Ibtl.eman ct al., 1991 ). One source

this Iflanner is a collection of case frame.s with RSq" 
relations hohling between them as shown in Figure 2. 
Starting from a text phu, of this l ind, I,he lexical 
choice module traverses a multilayered collection of 
networks (one of these layers is given by ;~ ta?onomy of 
lexical discourse structure relations disc||ssed), l)ur- 
ing the I,r;~versal, the text plan is transformed into n 
lexicalized Partial (;','a~,matieal /~truclure (pf~s); 7 it 
is called 'partial' because it contains precisely that 
an|ou||t ofgran|matic.al infornmtion which is necessary

Figure 3: PGS structure for the senteuce The man is 
lying; he is a liar 
for lexical choice. The PGS iS passed to tile grammar 
(a systemic grammar  of Gerlnan; el. Teich, 1992) for 
final syntactic realization. Figure 3 shows a sample 
pos encoded ;m a Typed Features Structure (el. Bate- 
man el al., 1992).  
The tirst and the most important  ask in tailoring 
the text plan to linguistic resources is to find a lex- 
ieally biased discourse structure relation for the Rs'r 
relation specified in the text l)lan. The search is done 
in accordance with the filnctional content, the inten- 
tion of the speaker, and the contents of the arguments 
of the RST relation. If tile RST relation connects unre- 
lated case frames 8 (as, e.g., EVIDENCE in In winter, the 
days are short. It is getting light late and eaHy dark.) 
these case frames are realized independently without 
being connected by a lexical discourse structure rela- 
tion. If the cruse frames are related, tile following three 
variations are possible: 
(i) An RST relation instantiat ion coincides with a lex- 
ieal discourse structure relation; as, e.g., the instanti- 
ation of RESTATEMENT in the following rudimentary 
text plan coinsides with our RESTATEMENT: 
(R2/RI.~STaTI~Mtr NT 
: s tatement1 (SAYING/ SYI'UATION 
:sayer Sveta/  person 
: verb iage  #unknown# 
:manner (quiet  
: sca le  #minima\]#) 
: ob l igatory - ro les  ( : sayer ,  
:verbiage, :manner, 
: situation) ) 
:statement2 (SAYINO/ SITUATION 
:sayer greta/ person 
:manner (quiet 
:scale ~minimal#) 
:obligatory-roles (:sayer, 
:verbiage, :manner, 
, , .o :~ituatiQn))) . 
If so, tim suDciassmeatlon of  the lextcal discourse 
structure relation deter,nines its final realization. For 
example, the above text plan could be realized as 
a GENERALIZED II.I,~STATF, MI,~NT: S'vela fl'l'islerle; sic 
sayle elwas .qanz leise lit. 'Sveta whispered; she said 
something very quietly'; an INTENSIFYING RESTATE- 
MlgN'r: Svela sagle ehvas sehr leise; sic hauchte es 
kaum hb'rbar hin llt. 'Sveta said something very quietly; 
she breathed it hardly audible', etc. 
(ii) An RST relation instant iat ion subsumes everal dis- 
s Case frames are considered tobe unrelated if between them 
or one of their roles no identity, is-a, causer, location, etc. rela- 
tion holds. 
tinct classes of lexical discourse structure relations; as, 
e.g., the instantiation of the aST relation CONTRAST 
in (this plan is also highly simplified): 
(R2/OONTRAST 
:act imn (OCCUPATION/ SITUATION 
:actor  Roman/ nation 
:actoe Gaul/ state 
:obligatory-roles (:actor, 
actee, :situation)) 
:action2 (DeCUPATION/ SITUATION 
:actor Roman/ nation 
:actee (village /location 
:part-of : Gaul) 
:negation + 
:obligatory-roles (:actor, 
actee, :situation))) 
may be realized either as CONTI~ASTIVE CI,ARIFICA- 
TION (ga) or as CONTR.ASTIVE ENIIANCEMENT (,Oh): 
(9) a. (2aul is entirehj occupied by the I~o- 
marts; well, not enti~vly . . .one small 
village still hohls out. 
b. Gaul is uhnost entirehj oecvpied by 
the l?omans; but one small village still 
hohls out. 
In this case, tim taxonomy of lexical discourse struc- 
ture relations is entered at a relatively general level 
(in the worst case at TOP). 
(iii) An lIST relation is not captured by our taxonomy 
(as, e.g., CONCI,ISSION). Then, the corresponding ease 
fi'ames are treated as unrelated (see above). 
5 RELATED WORK 
Our proposal for tile description of lexically biased 
discourse structure relations resembles l)anlos'  work 
(Danlos, 1987), who presented acceptable hmse pat- 
tern sequences explMtly in a Discourse Grammar. 
The. basic difference between Danlos' work and ours 
is that in the Discourse (h'amrnar, clause pattern se- 
qtlences are represented as concreLe valency sehelllatlt 
while in our model they are represented as functional 
distinctions that encode sequcndes o\[' I,FS. As a result, 
we do I/el. \['aee the probhml of being restricted to a 
concrete small domahl as l)anlos does. 
Metoer's text phumer (Meteer, 1992) is another 
prol)osa.l for the realization of lexically biased dis- 
course strucl.ure relations. \[/ut while we argue that 
lexically biased (liscourse structure relal;ions are to 
I)e realized by a functionally motiwd,ed h'.xical choice. 
model, Meteer sugggests a single struetundly  moti 
rated model For text planning, which also sul)sumes 
lexical choice. This is different from, e.g., (R.ubi- 
neff, 1992), who ensures the expressil)ility o1" discourse 
structure relations provide(l I)y a conventional text 
l)hmner by annotat ing linguistic structures. 
Elhadad's prol)osal (Elhadad, 1992) to  use 7bpoi 
(inference ,'ules that encode relations between t)ropo - 
sitk)ns incorporating lexical material) as discourse 
structure relations is aimed at exploit ing lexical phe- 
nomena for discourse organization. Elhadad focuses, 
however, on the 'argumentat ive potential '  of lexieal 
items r;~t.her t.llan on lexica.lly biased discourse struc- 
ture relations.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE 
WORK 
In this paper, we argue<l that it, is useful Lo distin- 
guish between two levels of discourse organization: a
global discourse organization, which is not afli~cted by 
linguistic means; and a finer discourse orgauizal,iou, 
which is built tip in accordance with the linguistic ma- 
terial that is availal>le for the meaning communicated. 
We have shown that reiteration aud collocatiott re- 
lations may function as discourse stru<:ture relatious 
and that these relations are well represented by Lez'- 
ical Function sequences. We presented a taxonomy 
of lexically biased discourse strucl:ure relations, which 
is related to l Ial l iday's proposal for grouI>ing inter- 
clausal logico-semantic relations aud suggested l.o use 
this taxonomy ill a lexical ch<>ice niodule. 
One of the ope=n problenis we face is how sulli<:iently 
detailed COlltP, Xtllal COllstrailits Cttll be aC(lllircd ill or: 
der to guide the choice of one discourse structllre re- 
lation over others. '.\['his will ccrtaillly be olle of the 
topics we wilI have to address in the future.
