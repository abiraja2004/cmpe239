We believe that identifying the structure of scien- 
tific argumentation in articles can help in tasks 
such as automatic summarization or the auto- 
mated construction of citation indexes. One par- 
ticularly important aspect of this structure is the 
question of who a given scientific statement is at- 
tributed to: other researchers, the field in general, 
or the authors themselves. 
We present he algorithm and a systematic eval- 
uation of a system which can recognize the most 
salient textual properties that contribute to the 
global argumentative structure of a text. In this 
paper we concentrate on two particular features, 
namely the occurrences ofprototypical gents and 
their actions in scientific text. 
1 In t roduct ion  
When writing an article, one does not normally 
go straight to presenting the innovative scien- 
tific claim. Insteacl, one establishes other, well- 
known scientific facts first, which are contributed 
by other researchers. Attribution of ownership of- 
ten happens explicitly, by phrases uch as "Chom- 
sky (1965) claims that". The question of intel- 
lectual attribution is important for researchers: 
not understanding the argumentative status of 
part of the text is a common problem for non- 
experts reading highly specific texts aimed at ex- 
perts (Rowley, 1982). In particular, after reading 
an article, researchers need to know who holds the 
"knowledge claim" for a certain fact that interests 
them. 
We propose that segmentation according to in- 
tellectual ownership can be done automatically, 
and that such a segmentation has advantages for 
various hallow text understanding tasks. At the 
heart of our classification scheme is the following 
trisection: 
* BACKGROUND (generally known work) 
* OWN,  new work and 
. specific OTHER work. 
The advantages of a segmentation at a rhetori- 
cal level is that rhetorics is conveniently constant

HCRC Language T chnology Group, Edinburgh. 
BACKGROUND:  
Researchers in knowledge representa- 
tion agree that one of the hard problems of 
understanding narrative is the representation 
of temporal information. Certain facts of nat- 
ural language make it hard to capture tempo- 
ral information \[...\] 
OTHER WORK:  
Recently, Researcher-4 has suggested the 
following solution to this problem \[...\]. 
WEAKNESS/CONTRAST:  
But this solution cannot be used to inter- 
pret the following Japanese examples: \[...\] 
OWN CONTRIBUT ION:  
We propose a solution which circumvents 
this p row while retaining the explanatory 
power of Researcher-4's approach. 
Figure h Fictional introduction section 
across different articles. Subject matter, on the 
contrary, is not constant, nor are writing style and 
other factors. 
We work with a corpus of scientific pa- 
pers (80 computational linguistics conference ar- 
ticles (ACL, EACL, COLING or ANLP), de- 
posited on the CMP_LG archive between 1994 
and 1996). This is a difficult test bed due to 
the large variation with respect o different fac- 
tors: subdomain (theoretical linguistics, statisti- 
cal NLP, logic programming, computational psy- 
cholinguistics), types of research (implementa- 
tion, review, evaluation, empirical vs. theoreti- 
cal research), writing style (formal vs. informal) 
and presentational styles (fixed section structure 
of type Introduction-Method-Results-Conclusion 
vs. more idiosyncratic, problem-structured presen- 
tation). 
One thing, however, is constant across all arti- 
cles: the argumentative aim of every single article 
is to show that the given work is a contribution to 
science (Swales, 1990; Myers, 1992; Hyland, 1998). 
Theories of scientific argumentation in research ar- 
ticles stress that authors follow well-predictable 
stages of argumentation, as in the fictional intro- 
duction in figure 1.

Figure 2: Annotation Scheme for Argumentative Zones 
Our hypothesis i that a segmentation based on 
regularities of scientific argumentation and on at- 
tribution of intellectual ownership is one of the 
most stable and generalizable dimensions which 
contribute to the structure of scientific texts. In 
the next section we will describe an annotation 
scheme which we designed for capturing these ef- 
fects. Its categories are based on Swales' (1990) 
CARS model. 
1.1 The scheme 
As our corpus contains many statements talking 
about relations between own and other work, we 
decided to add two classes ("zones") for express- 
ing relations to the core set of OWN, OTHER 
and BACKGROUND, namely contrastive statements 
(CONTRAST;  comparable to Swales' (1990) move 
2A/B) and statements of intellectual ancestry 
(BAsis; Swales' move 2D). The label OTHER is 
thus reserved for neutral descriptions of other 
work. OWN segments are further subdivided to 
mark explicit aim statements (AIM; Swales' move 
3.1A/B), and explicit section previews (TEXTUAL; 
Swales' move 3.3). All other statements about the 
own work are classified as OwN. Each of the seven 
category covers one sentence. 
Our classification, which is a further develop- 
ment of the scheme in Teufel and Moens (1999), 
can be described procedurally as a decision tree 
(Figure 2), where five questions are asked about 
each sentence, concerning intellectual attribution, 
author stance and continuation vs. contrast. Fig- 
ure 3 gives typical example sentences for each zone. 
The intellectual-attribution distinction we make 
is comparable with Wiebe's (1994) distinction into 
subjective and objective statements. Subjectivity 
is a property which is related to the attribution of 
authorship as well as to author stance, but it is 
just one of the dimensions we consider. 
1.2 Use o f  Argumentat ive  Zones 
Which practical use would segmenting a paper into 
argumentative zones have? 
Firstly, rhetorical information as encoded in 
these zones should prove useful for summariza- 
tion. Sentence extracts, still the main type of 
summarization around, are notoriously context- 
insensitive. Context in the form of argumentative 
relations of segments to the overall paper could 
provide a skeleton by which to tailor sentence x- 
tracts to user expertise (as certain users or certain 
tasks do not require certain types of information). 
A system which uses such rhetorical zones to pro- 
duce task-tailored extracts for medical articles, al- 
beit on the basis of manually-segmented xts, is 
given by Wellons and Purcell (1999). 
Another hard task is sentence xtraction from 
long texts, e.g. scientific journal articles of 20 
pages of length, with a high compression. This 
task is hard because one has to make decisions 
about how the extracted sentences relate to each 
other and how they relate to the overall message 
of the text, before one can further compress them. 
Rhetorical context of the kind described above is 
very likely to make these decisions easier. 
Secondly, it should also help improve citation 
indexes, e.g. automatically derived ones like 
Lawrence et al's (1999) and Nanba and Oku- 
mura's (1999). Citation indexes help organize sci- 
entific online literature by linking cited (outgoing) 
and citing (incoming) articles with a given text. 
But these indexes are mainly "quantitative", list- 
ing other works without further qualifying whether 
a reference to another work is there to extend the

it, or just provide it as general background. This 
"qualitative" information could be directly con- 
tributed by our argumentative zones. 
In this paper, we will describe the algorithm of 
an argumentative zoner. The main focus of the 
paper is the description of two features which are 
particularly useful for attribution determination: 
prototypical gents and actions. 
2 Human Annotat ion  o f  
Argumentat ive  Zones  
We have previously evaluated the scheme mpiri- 
cally by extensive experiments with three subjects, 
over a range of 48 articles (Teufel et al, 1999). 
We measured stability (the degree to which the 
same annotator will produce an annotation after 
6 weeks) and reproducibility (the degree to which 
two unrelated annotators will produce the same 
annotation), using the Kappa coefficient K (Siegel 
and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996), which con- 
trols agreement P(A) for chance agreement P(E): 
K = P{A)-P(E) 
1-P(Z) 
Kappa is 0 for if agreement is only as would be 
expected by chance annotation following the same 
distribution as the observed istribution, and 1 for 
perfect agreement. Values of Kappa surpassing 
.8 are typically accepted as showing a very high 
level of agreement (Krippendorff, 1980; Landis and 
Koch, 1977). 
Our experiments show that humans can distin- 
guish own, other specific and other general work 
with high stability (K=.83, .79, .81; N=1248; k=2, 
where K stands for the Kappa coefficient, N for 
the number of items (sentences) annotated and k 
for the number of annotators) and reproducibil- 
ity (K=.78, N=4031, k=3), corresponding to 94%, 
93%, 93% (stability) and 93% (reproducibility) 
agreement. 
The full distinction into all seven categories of 
the annotation scheme is slightly less stable and 
reproducible (stability: K=.82, .81, .76; N=1220; 
k=2 (equiv. to 93%, 92%, 90% agreement); repro- 
ducibility: K=.71, N=4261, k=3 (equiv. to 87% 
agreement)), but still in the range of what is gener- 
ally accepted as reliable annotation. We conclude 
from this that humans can distinguish attribution 
and full argumentative zones, if trained. Human 
annotation is used as trMning material in our sta- 
tistical classifier. 
3 Automat ic  Argumentat ive  
Zon ing  
As our task is not defined by topic coherence 
like the related tasks of Morris and Hirst (1991), 
Hearst (1997), Kan et al (1998) and Reynar 
(1999), we predict hat keyword-based techniques 
for automatic argumentative zoning will not work 
well (cf. the results using text categorization as
described later). We decided to perform machine 
learning, based on sentential features like the ones 
used by sentence xtraction. Argumentative zones 
have properties which help us determine them on 
the surface: 
? Zones appear in typical positions in the article 
(Myers, 1992); we model this with a set of 
location features. 
? Linguistic features like tense and voice cor- 
relate with zones (Biber (1995) and Riley 
(1991) show correlation for similar zones like 
"method" and "introduction"). We model 
this with syntactic features. 
? Zones tend to follow particular other zones 
(Swales, 1990); we model this with an ngram 
model operating over sentences. 
? Beginnings of attribution zones are linguisti- 
cally marked by meta-discourse like "Other 
researchers claim that" (Swales, 1990; Hy- 
land, 1998); we model this with a specialized 
agents and actions recognizer, and by recog- 
nizing formal citations. 
? Statements without explicit attribution are 
interpreted as being of the same attribution 
as previous entences in the same segment of 
attribution; we model this with a modified 
agent feature which keeps track of previously 
recognized agents.

3.1 Recognizing Agents and Actions 
Paice (1981) introduces grammars for pattern 
matching of indicator phrases, e.g. "the 
aim/purpose of this paper/article/study" and "we 
conclude/propose". Such phrases can be useful 
indicators of overall importance. However, for 
our task, more flexible meta-diiscourse expressions 
need to be determined. The ,description of a re- 
search tradition, or the stateraent that the work 
described in the paper is the continuation ofsome 
other work, cover a wide range of syntactic and 
lexical expressions and are too hard to find for a 
mechanism like simple pattern matching.

Figure 4: Agent Lexicon: 168 Patterns, 13 Classes 
We suggest hat the robust recognition of pro- 
totypical agents and actions is one way out of this 
dilemma. The agents we propose to recognize de- 
scribe fixed role-players in the argumentation. I  
Figure 1, prototypical agents are given in bold- 
face ("Researchers in knowledge representation, 
"Researcher-4" and "we"). We also propose pro- 
totypical actions frequently occurring in scientific 
discourse (shown underlined in Figure 1): the re- 
searchers "agree", Researcher-4 "suggested" some- 
thing, the solution "cannot be used". 
We will now describe an algorithm which rec- 
ognizes and classifies agents and actions. We 
use a manually created lexicon for patterns for 
agents, and a manually clustered verb lexicon for 
the verbs. Figure 4 lists the agent types we dis- 
tinguish. The main three types are US_aGENT, 
THEM-AGENT and GENERAL.AGENT. A fourth 
type is US.PREVIOUS_AGENT (the authors, but in 
a previous paper). 
Additional agent types include non-personal 
agents like aims, problems, solutions, absence of 
solution, or textual segments. There are four 
equivalence classes of agents with ambiguous 
reference ("this system"), namely REF_US_AGENT, 
THEM-PRONOUN_AGENT, AIM.-REF-AGENT, 
REF_AGENT. The total of 168 patterns in the 
lexicon expands to many more as we use a replace 
mechanism (@WORK_NOUN is expanded to 
"paper, article, study, chapter" etc). 
For verbs, we use a manually created the ac- 
tion lexicon summarized in Figure 6. The verb 
classes are based on semantic oncepts uch as 
similarity, contrast, competition, presentation, ar- 
gumentation and textual structure. For ex- 
ample, PRESENTATION..ACTIONS include commu- 
nication verbs like "present", "report", "state" 
(Myers, 1992; Thompson and Yiyun, 1991), RE- 
SEARCH_ACTIONS include "analyze", "conduct" 
and "observe", and ARGUMENTATION_ACTIONS 
"argue", "disagree", "object to". Domain-specific 
actions are contained in the classes indicating 
a problem ( ".fail", "degrade", "overestimate"), 
and solution-contributing actions (" "circumvent', 
solve", "mitigate"). 
The main reason for using a hand-crafted, genre-- 
specific lexicon instead of a general resource such 
as WordNet or Levin's (1993) classes (as used in 
Klavans and Kan (1998)), was to avoid polysemy 
problems without having to perform word sense 
disambiguation. Verbs in our texts often have a 
specialized meaning in the domain of scientific ar- 
gumentation, which our lexicon readily encodes. 
We did notice some ambiguity problems (e.g. "fol- 
low" can mean following another approach, or it 
can mean follow in a sense having nothing to do 
with presentation of research, e.g. following an 
arc in an algorithm). In a wider domain, however, 
ambiguity would be a much bigger problem. 
Processing of the articles includes transforma- 
tion from I~TEX into XML format, recognition 
of formal citations and author names in running 
text, tokenization, sentence separation and POS- 
tagging. The pipeline uses the TTT software pro- 
vided by the HCRC Language Technology Group 
(Grover et al, 1999). The algorithm for deter- 
mining agents in subject positions (or By-PPs in 
passive sentences) is based on a finite automaton 
which uses POS-input; cf. Figure 5. 
In the case that more than one finite verb is 
found in a sentence, the first finite verb which has 
agents and/or actions in the sentences i used as 
a value for that sentence. 
4 Eva luat ion  
We carried out two evaluations. Evaluation A 
tests whether all patterns were recognized as in- 
tended by the algorithm, and whether patterns 
were found that should not have been recognized. 
Evaluation B tests how well agent and action 
recognition helps us perform argumentative zon- 
ing automatically. 
4.1 Evaluation A: Cor rectness  
We first manually evaluated the error level of the 
POS-Tagging of finite verbs, as our algorithm cru- 
cially relies on finite verbs. In a random sample of 
100 sentences from our corpus (containing a total 
of 184 finite verbs), the tagger showed a recall of 
12 
1. Start from the first finite verb in the sentence. 
2. Check right context of the finite verb for verbal forms of interest which might make up more 
complex tenses. Remain within the assumed clause boundaries; do not cross commas or other 
finite verbs. Once the main verb of that construction (the "semantic" verb) has been found, 
a simple morphological nalysis determines its lemma; the tense and voice of the construction 
follow from the succession of auxiliary verbs encountered. 
3. Look up the lemma of semantic verb in Action Lexicon; return the associated Action Class if 
successful. Else return Action 0. 
4. Determine if one of the 32 fixed negation words contained in the lexicon (e.g. "not, don't, 
neither") is present within a fixed window of 6 to the right of the finite verb. 
5. Search for the agent either as a by-PP to the right, or as a subject-NP to the left, depending on 
the voice of the construction as determined in step 2. Remain within assumed clause boundaries. 
6. If one of the Agent Patterns matches within that area in the sentence, return the Agent Type. 
Else return Agent 0. 
7. Repeat Steps 1-6 until there are no more finite verbs left.

95% and a precision of 93%. 
We found that for the 174 correctly determined 
finite verbs (out of the total 184), the heuristics for 
negation worked without any errors (100% accu- 
racy). The correct semantic verb was determined 
in 96% percent of all cases; errors are mostly due 
to misrecognition of clause boundaries. Action 
Type lookup was fully correct, even in the case 
of phrasal verbs and longer idiomatic expressions 
("have to" is a NEED..ACTION; "be inspired by" is 
a, CONTINUE_ACTION). There were 7 voice errors, 
2 of which were due to POS-tagging errors (past 
participle misrecognized). The remaining 5 voice 
errors correspond to a 98% accuracy. Figure 7 
gives an example for a voice error (underlined) in 
the output of the action/agent determination. 
Correctness of Agent Type determination was 
tested on a random sample of 100 sentences con- 
taining at least one agent, resulting in 111 agents. 
No agent pattern that should have been identi- 
fied was missed (100% recall). Of the 111 agents, 
105 cases were completely correct: the agent pat- 
tern covered the complete grammatical subject or 
by-PP intended (precision of 95%). There was one 
complete rror, caused by a POS-tagging error. In 
5 of the 111 agents, the pattern covered only part

4.2 Evaluation B: Usefulness for 
Argumentat ive Zoning 
We evaluated the usefulness of the Agent and Ac- 
tion features by measuring if they improve the 
classification results of our stochastic classifier for 
argumentative zones. 
We use 14 features given in figure 8, some of 
which are adapted from sentence xtraction tech- 
niques (Paice, 1990; Kupiec et eL1., 1995; Teufel and 
Moens, 1999).

Figure 8: Other features used 
All features except Citation Location and 
Citation Type proved helpful for classification. 
Two different statistical models were used: a Naive 
Bayesian model as in Kupiec et al's (1995) exper- 
iment, cf. Figure 9, and an ngram model over sen- 
tences, cf. Figure 10. Learning is supervised and 
training examples are provided by our previous hu- 
man annotation. Classification preceeds sentence 
by sentence. The ngram model combines evidence 
from the context (Cm-1, Cm-2) and from I senten- 
tiai features (F,~,o...Fmj-t), assuming that those 
two factors are independent ofeach other. It uses 
the same likelihood estimation as the Naive Bayes, 
but maximises a context-sensitive prior using the 
Viterbi algorithm. We received best results for 
n=2, i.e. a bigram model. 
The results of stochastic lassification (pre- 
sented in figure 11) were compiled with a 10-fold 
cross-validation our 80-paper corpus, contain- 
ing a total of 12422 sentences (classified items). 
As the first baseline, we use a standard text cat- 
egorization method for classification (where each 
sentence is considered as a document*) Baseline 1 
has an accuracy of 69%, which is low considering 
that the most frequent category (OWN) also coy- 
errs 69% of all sentences. Worse still, the classifier 
classifies almost all sentences as OWN and OTHER 
segments (the most frequent categories). Recall on 
the rare categories but important categories AIM, 
TEXTUAL, CONTRAST and BASIS is zero or very 
low. Text classification is therefore not a solution. 
*We used the Rainbow implementation of a Naive Bayes 
tf/idf method, 10-fold cross-validation. 
Baseline 2, the most frequent category (OWN), 
is a particularly bad baseline: its recall on all cate- 
gories except OWN is zero. We cannot see this bad 
performance in the percentage accuracy values, 
but only in the Kappa values (measured against 
one human annotator, i.e. k=2). As Kappa takes 
performance on rare categories into account more, 
it is a more intuitive measure for our task. 
In figure 11, NB refers to the Naive Bayes model, 
and NB+ to the Naive Bayes model augmented 
with the ngram model. We can see that the 
stochastic models obtain substantial improvement 
over the baselines, particularly with respect to pre- 
cision and recall of the rare categories, raising re- 
call considerably in all cases, while keeping preci- 
sion at the same level as Baseline 1 or improving 
it (exception: precision for BASIS drops; precision 
for AIM is insignificantly lower). 
If we look at the contribution of single features 
(reported for the Naive Bayes system in figure 12), 
we see that Agent and Action features improve 
the overall performance of the system by .02 and 
.04 Kappa points respectively (.36 to .38/.40). 
This is a good performance for single features. 
Agent is a strong feature beating both baselines. 
Taken by itself, its performance at K=.08 is still 
weaker than some other features in the pool, e.g. 
the Headline feature (K=.19), the C i tat ion fea- 
ture (K=.I8) and the Absolute Location Fea- 
ture (K=.17). (Figure 12 reports classification re- 
sults only for the stronger features, i.e. those who 
are better than Baseline 2). The Action feature, 
if considered on its own, is rather weak: it shows 
a slightly better Kappa value than Baseline 2, but 
does not even reach the level of random agreement 
(K=0). Nevertheless, if taken together with the 
other features, it still improves results. 
Building on the idea that intellectual attribu- 
tion is a segment-based phenomena, we improved 
the Agent feature by including history (feature 
SAgent). The assumption is that in unmarked sen- 
tences the agent of the previous attribution isstill 
active. Wiebe (1994) also reports segment-based 
agenthood as one of the most successful features. 
SAgent alone achieved a classification success of 
K=.21, which makes SAgent the best single fea- 
tures available in the entire feature pool. Inclusion 
of SAgent to the final model improved results to 
K=.43 (bigram model). 
Figure 12 also shows that different features are 
better at disambiguating certain categories. The 
Formulaic feature, which is not very strong on 
its own, is the most diverse, as it contributes to 
the disambiguation f six categories directly. Both 
Agent and Action features disambiguate cate-, 
gories which many of the other 12 features cannot 
disambiguate ( .g. CONTRAST), and SAgent addi- 
tionally contributes towards the determination f

The result for automatic lassification is in agree- 
ment with our previous experimental results for 
human classification: humans, too, recognize the 
categories AIM and TEXTUAL most robustly (cf. 
Figure 11). AIM and TEXTUAL sentences, tating 
knowledge claims and organizing the text respec- 
tively, are conventionalized to a high degree. The 
system's results for AIM sentences, for instance, 
compares favourably to similar sentence xtraction 
experiments (cf. Kupiec et al's (1995) results of 
42%/42% recall and precision for extracting "rel- 
evant" sentences from scientific articles). BASIS 
and CONTRAST sentences have a less prototypical 
syntactic realization, and they also occur at less 
predictable places in the document. Therefore, it 
is far more difficult for both machine and human 
to recognize such sentences. 
While the system does well for AIM and TEX- 
TUAL sentences, and provides ubstantial improve- 
ment over both baselines, the difference to human 
performance is still quite large (cf. figure 11). We 
attribute most of this difference to the modest size 
of our training corpus: 80 papers are not much for 
machine learning of such high-level features. It is 
possible that a more sophisticated model, in com- 
bination with more training material, would im- 
prove results significantly. However, when we ran 
them on our data as it is now, different other sta- 
tistical models, e.g. Ripper (Cohen, 1996) and a 
Maximum Entropy model, all showed similar nu- 
merical results. 
Another factor which decreases results are in- 
consistencies in the training data: we discovered 
that 4% of the sentences with the same features 
were classified differently by the human annota- 
tion. This points to the fact that our set of fea- 
tures could be made more distinctive. In most 
of these cases, there were linguistic expressions 
present, such as subtle signs of criticism, which 
humans correctly identified, but for which the fea- 
tures are too coarse. Therefore, the addition of 
"deeper" features to the pool, which model the se- 
mantics of the meta-discourse hallowly, seemed 
a promising avenue. We consider the automatic 
and robust recognition of agents and actions, as 
presented here, to be the first incarnations of such 
features.

Argumentative zoning is the task of breaking a 
text containing a scientific argument into linear 
zones of the same argumentative status, or zones 
of the same intellectual attribution. We plan to 
use argumentative zoning as a first step for IR and 
shallow document understanding tasks like sum- 
marization. In contrast o hierarchical segmenta- 
tion (e.g. Marcu's (1997) work, which is based on 
RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987)), this type of 
segmentation aims at capturing the argumentative 
status of a piece of text in respect o the overall 
argumentative act of the paper. It does not deter-

Precision and Recall of Automatic Processing (Naive Bayes system), per 
mine the rhetorical structure within zones. Sub- 
zone structure is most likely related to domain- 
specific rhetorical relations which are not directly 
relevant to the discourse-level relations we wish to 
recognize. 
We have presented a fully implemented proto- 
type for argumentative zoning. Its main inno- 
vation are two new features: prototypical agents 
and actions - -  semi-shallow representations of the 
overall scientific argumentation f the article. For 
agent and action recognition, we use syntactic 
heuristics and two extensive libraries of patterns. 
Processing is robust and very low in error. We 
evaluated the system without and with the agent 
and action features and found that the features im- 
prove results for automatic argumentative zoning 
considerably. History-aware agents are the best 
single feature in a large, extensively tested feature 
pool.
