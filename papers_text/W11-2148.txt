Abstract
MonoTrans2 is a translation system that com-
bines machine translation (MT) with human
computation using two crowds of monolin-
gual source (Haitian Creole) and target (En-
glish) speakers. We report on its use in the
WMT 2011 Haitian Creole to English trans-
lation task, showing that MonoTrans2 trans-
lated 38% of the sentences well compared to
Google Translate?s 25%.
1 Introduction
One of the most remarkable success stories to come
out of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti in-
volved translation (Munro, 2010). While other
forms of emergency response and communication
channels were failing, text messages were still get-
ting through, so a number of people came together to
create a free phone number for emergency text mes-
sages, which allowed earthquake victims to report
those who were trapped or in need of medical atten-
tion. The problem, of course, was that most people
were texting in Haitian Creole (Kreyol), a language
not many of the emergency responders understood,
and few, if any, professional translators were avail-
able. The availability of usable translations literally
became a matter of life and death.
In response to this need, Stanford University grad-
uate student Rob Munro coordinated the rapid cre-
ation of a crowdsourcing framework, which allowed
volunteers ? including, for example, Haitian expa-
triates and French speakers ? to translate messages,
providing responders with usable information in as
little as ten minutes. Translations may not have been
perfect, but to a woman in labor, it had to have made
a big difference for English-speaking responders to
see Undergoing children delivery Delmas 31 instead
of Fanm gen tranche pou fe` yon pitit nan Delmas 31.
What about a scenario, though, in which even am-
ateur bilingual volunteers are hard to find, or too
few in number? What about a scenario, e.g. the
March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, in
which there are many people worldwide who wish
to help but are not fluent in both the source and tar-
get languages?
For the last few years, we have been exploring the
idea of monolingual crowdsourcing for translation
? that is, technology-assisted collaborative transla-
tion involving crowds of participants who know only
the source or target language (Buzek et al, 2010;
Hu, 2009; Hu et al, 2010; Hu et al, 2011; Resnik
et al, 2010). Our MonoTrans2 framework has pre-
viously shown very promising results on children?s
books: on a test set where Google Translate pro-
duced correct translations for only 10% of the input
sentences, monolingual German and Spanish speak-
ers using our framework produced translations that
were fully correct (as judged by two independent
bilinguals) nearly 70% of the time (Hu et al, 2011).
We used the same framework in the WMT 2011
Haitian-English translation task. For this experi-
ment, we hired Haitian Creole speakers located in
Haiti, and recruited English speakers located in the
U.S., to serve as the monolingual crowds.
2 System
MonoTrans2 is a translation system that combines
machine translation (MT) with human computation
(Quinn et al, 2011) using two ?crowds? of mono-
lingual source (Haitian Creole) and target (English)
399
speakers.1 We summarize its operation here; see Hu
et al (2011) for details.
The Haitian Creole sentence is first automatically
translated into English and presented to the English
speakers. The English speakers then can take any of
the following actions for candidate translations:
? Mark a phrase in the candidate as an error
? Suggest a new translation candidate
? Vote candidates up or down
Identifying likely errors and voting for candidates
are things monolinguals can do reasonably well:
even without knowing the intended interpretation,
you can often identify when some part of a sentence
doesn?t make sense, or when one sentence seems
more fluent or plausible than another. Sometimes
rather than identifying errors, it is easier to suggest
an entirely new translation candidate based on the
information available on the target side, a variant
of monolingual post-editing (Callison-Burch et al,
2004).
Any new translation candidates are then back-
translated into Haitian Creole, and any spans marked
as translation errors are projected back to identify
the corresponding spans in the source sentence, us-
ing word alignments as the bridge (cf. Hwa et al
(2002), Yarowsky et al (2001)).2 The Haitian Cre-
ole speakers can then:
? Rephrase the entire source sentence (cf.
(Morita and Ishida, 2009))
? ?Explain? spans marked as errors
? Vote candidates up or down (based on the back-
translation)
Source speakers can ?explain? error spans by of-
fering a different way of phrasing that piece of the
source sentence (Resnik et al, 2010), in order to
produce a new source sentence, or by annotating the
spans with images (e.g. via Google image search)
or Web links (e.g. to Wikipedia). The protocol then
continues: new source sentences created via partial-

or full-sentence paraphrase pass back through MT
to the English side, and any explanatory annota-
tions are projected back to the corresponding spans
in the English candidate translations (where the er-
ror spans had been identified). The process is asyn-
chronous: participants on the Haitian Creole and
English sides can work independently on whatever
is available to them at any time. At any point, the
voting-based scores can be used to extract a 1-best
translation.
In summary, the MonoTrans2 framework uses
noisy MT to cross the language barrier, and supports
monolingual participants in doing small tasks that
gain leverage from redundant information, the hu-
man capacity for linguistic and real-world inference,
and the wisdom of the crowd.
3 Experiment
We recruited 26 English speakers and 4 Haitian Cre-
ole speakers. The Haitian Creole speakers were re-
cruited from Haiti and do not speak English. Five of
the 26 English speakers were paid UMD undergrad-
uates; the other 21 were volunteer researchers, grad-
uate students, and staff unrelated to this research. 3
Over a 13 day period, Haitian Creole and English
speaker efforts totaled 15 and 29 hours, respectively.
4 Data Sets
Our original goal of fully processing the entire SMS
clean test and devtest sets could not be realized in the
available time, owing to unanticipated reshuffling of
the data by the shared task organizers and logistical
challenges working with participants in Haiti. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the data set sizes before and after
reshuffling. We put 1,224 sentences from the pre-
before after

results on the union of pre- and post-reshuffling de-
vtest sentences (Set A, |A| = 1516), and the post-
reshuffling test set (Set B, |B| = 1274 ).
5 Evaluation
Of the 1,347 sentences available for processing in
MonoTrans2, we define three subsets:
? Touched: Sentences that were processed by at
least one person (657 sentences)
? Each-side: Sentences that were processed by at
least one English speaker followed by at least
one Haitian Creole speaker (431 sentences)
? Full: Sentences that have at least three trans-
lation candidates, of which the most voted-for
one received at least three votes (207 sentences)
We intersect these three sets with sets A and B in or-
der to evaluate MonoTrans2 output against the pro-
vided references (Table 2).4
Set S |S| |S ?A| |S ?B|

scores between the sets. However, Table 4 shows
that when the MonoTrans2 process is run on test
items ?to completion?, in the sense defined by ?Full?
(i.e. Full?B), we see a dramatic BLEU gain of 6.39,
and a drop in TER of 2.29 points. Moreover, even
when only target-side or only source-side monolin-
gual participation is available we see a gain of 4.31
BLEU and a drop of 1.73 TER points (Touched?B).
By contrast, the results on the devtest data are en-
couraging, but arguably mixed (Table 3). In order to
step away from the vagaries of single-reference au-
tomatic evaluations, therefore, we also conducted an
evaluation based on human judgments. Two native
English speakers unfamiliar with the project were
recruited and paid for fluency and adequacy judg-
ments: for each target translation paired with its cor-
responding reference, each evaluator rated the tar-
get sentence?s fluency and adequacy on a 5-point
scale, where fluency of 5 indicates complete fluency
and adequacy of 5 indicates complete preservation
of meaning (Dabbadie et al, 2002).5

Full ?B 60 15 (25%) 23 (38%)
Table 5: Number of sentences with maximum possible
adequacy (5) in Full ?A and Full ?B, respectively.
Similar to Hu et al (2011), we adopt the very con-
servative criterion that a translation output is consid-
ered correct only if both evaluators independently
give it a rating of 5. Unlike Hu et al (2011), for
whom children?s book translation requires both flu-
ency and adequacy, we make this a requirement only

for adequacy, since in this scenario what matters to
aid organizations is not whether a translation is fully
fluent, but whether it is correct. On this criterion,
the Google Translate baseline of around 25% cor-
rect improves to around 40% for Monotrans, con-
sistently for both the devtest and test data (Table 5).
Nonetheless, Figures 1 and 2 make it clear that the
improvements in fluency are if anything more strik-
ing.

In addition to the main evaluation, we investi-
gated the relationship between tasks performed in
the MonoTrans2 system and human judgments us-
ing linear regression and an analysis of variance.
We evaluate the set of all 330 touched sentences in
Touched?A and Touched?B in order to under-
stand which properties of the MonoTrans2 process
correlate with better translation outcomes.
Our analysis focused on improvement over the
Google Translate baseline, looking specifically at
the improvement based on the human evaluators? av-
eraged fluency and adequacy scores.
Table 6 summarizes the positive and negative
effects for five of six variables we considered that
came out significant for at least one of the measures.

The positive results were as expected. Having
more votes for the winning candidate (mostSingle-
CandidateVote) made it more successful, since this
means that more people felt it was a good represen-
tative translation. Having more candidates to choose

gression for either adequacy or fluency.
from (candidateCount) meant that more people had
taken the time to generate alternatives, reflecting at-
tention paid to the sentence. Also, the amount of
attention paid to target speakers? requests for clarifi-
cation (numOfAnswers) is as expected related to the
adequacy of the final translation, and perhaps as ex-
pected does not correlate with fluency of the output
since it helps with meaning and not actual target-side
wording.
We were, however, confused at first by the neg-
ative influence of the roundTrips measure and vote-
Count measures. We conjecture that the first effect
arises due to a correlation between roundTrips and
translation difficulty; much harder sentences would
have led to many more paraphrase requests, and
hence to more round trips. We attempted to inves-
tigate this hypothesis by testing correlation with a
naive measure of sentence difficulty, length, but this
was not fruitful. We suspect that inspecting use of
abbreviations, proper nouns, source-side mistakes,
and syntactic complexity would give us more insight
into this issue.
As for voteCount, the negative correlation is un-
derstandable when considered side by side with
the other vote-based measure, mostSingleCandidat-
eVote. Having a higher number of votes for the win-
ning candidate leads to improvement (strongly sig-
nificant for both adequacy and fluency), so a higher
general vote count means that people were also vot-
ing more times for other candidates. Hence, once the
positive winning vote count is taken into account,
the remaining votes actually represent disagreement
on the candidates, hence correlating negatively with
overall improvement over baseline.
It is important to note that when these measures
are all considered together, they show that there is a
clear correlation between the MonoTrans2 system?s
human processing and the eventual increase in both
quality and fluency of the sentences. As people give
more attention to sentences, these sentences show
better performance, as judged by increase over base-
line.

incentives for, monolingual participants. In fact, get-

(b) Adequacy Distribution
Figure 2: Human judgments for fluency and adequacy in fully processed test items (Full ?B)
created a large number of logistical challenges, and
was a contributing factor as to why we did not obtain
translations for the entire test set. However, avail-
ability of monolingual participants is not the issue
being addressed in this experiment: we are confi-
dent that in a real-world scenario like the Haitian
or Japanese earthquakes, large numbers of monolin-
gual volunteers would be eager to help, certainly in
larger total numbers than bilingual volunteers. What
matters here, therefore, is not how much of the test
set was translated in total, but how much the trans-
lations improved for the sentences where monolin-
gual crowdsourcing was involved, compared to the
MT baseline, and what throughput might be like in
a real-world scenario.
We also were interested in throughput, particu-
larly in comparison to bilingual translators. In previ-
ous experimentation (Hu et al, 2011), throughput in
MonoTrans2 extrapolated to roughly 800 words per
day, a factor of 2.5 slower than professional trans-
lators? typical speed of 2000 words per day. In
this experiment, overall translation speed averaged
about 300 words per day, a factor of more than 6
times slower. However, this is an extremely pes-
simistic estimate, for several reasons. First, our pre-
vious experiment had more than 20 users per side,
while here our Haitian crowd consisted of only four
people. Second, we discovered after beginning the
experiment that the translation of our instructions
into Haitian Creole had been done somewhat slop-
pily. And, third, we encountered a range of tech-
nical and logistical problems with our Haitian par-
ticipants, ranging from finding a location with In-
ternet access to do the work (ultimately an Internet
Cafe? turned out to be the best option), to slow and
sporadic connections (even in an Internet Cafe?), to
relative lack of motivation for part-time rather than
full-time work. It is fair to assume that in a real-
world scenario, some unanticipated problems like
these might crop up, but it also seems fair to assume
that many would not; for example, most people from
the Haitian Creole and French-speaking communi-
ties who volunteered using Munro et al?s system
in January 2010 were not themselves located in the
403
third world.
Finally, regarding quality, the results here are
promising, albeit not as striking as those Hu et al
(2011) obtained for Spanish-German translation of
children?s books. The nature of SMS messages
themselves may have been a contributing factor to
the lower translation adequacy: even in clean form,
these are sometimes written using shorthand (e.g.
?SVP?), and are sometimes not syntactically correct.
The text messages are seldom related to each other,
unlike sentences in larger bodies of text where even
partially translated sentences can be related to each
other to provide context, as is the case for children?s
books. One should also keep in mind that the under-
lying machine translation engine, Google Translate
between Haitian Creole and English, is still in an al-
pha phase.
Those considerations notwithstanding, it is en-
couraging to see a set of machine translations get
better without the use of any human bilingual exper-
tise. We are optimistic that with further refinements
and research, monolingual translation crowdsourc-
ing will make it possible to harness the vast num-
ber of technologically connected people who want
to help in some way when disaster strikes.
