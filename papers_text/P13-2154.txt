Abstract
We have elicited human quantitative judg-
ments of semantic relatedness for 122
pairs of nouns and compiled them into a
new set of relatedness norms that we call
Rel-122. Judgments from individual sub-
jects in our study exhibit high average cor-
relation to the resulting relatedness means
(r = 0.77, ? = 0.09, N = 73), although not
as high as Resnik?s (1995) upper bound
for expected average human correlation to
similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests
that human perceptions of relatedness are
less strictly constrained than perceptions
of similarity and establishes a clearer ex-
pectation for what constitutes human-like
performance by a computational measure
of semantic relatedness.
We compare the results of several
WordNet-based similarity and relatedness
measures to our Rel-122 norms and
demonstrate the limitations of WordNet
for discovering general indications of
semantic relatedness. We also offer a cri-
tique of the field?s reliance upon similarity
norms to evaluate relatedness measures.
1 Introduction
Despite the well-established technical distinc-
tion between semantic similarity and relatedness
(Agirre et al, 2009; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006;
Resnik, 1995), comparison to established similar-
ity norms from psychology remains part of the
standard evaluative procedure for assessing com-
putational measures of semantic relatedness. Be-
cause similarity is only one particular type of re-
latedness, comparison to similarity norms fails to
give a complete view of a relatedness measure?s
efficacy.
In keeping with Budanitsky and Hirst?s (2006)
observation that ?comparison with human judg-
ments is the ideal way to evaluate a measure of
similarity or relatedness,? we have undertaken the
creation of a new set of relatedness norms.
2 Background
The similarity norms of Rubenstein and Goode-
nough (1965; henceforth R&G) and Miller and
Charles (1991; henceforth M&C) have seen ubiq-
uitous use in evaluation of computational mea-
sures of semantic similarity and relatedness.
R&G established their similarity norms by pre-
senting subjects with 65 slips of paper, each of
which contained a pair of nouns. Subjects were
directed to read through all 65 noun pairs, then
sort the pairs ?according to amount of ?similarity
of meaning.?? Subjects then assigned similarity
scores to each pair on a scale of 0.0 (completely
dissimilar) to 4.0 (strongly synonymous).
The R&G results have proven to be highly repli-
cable. M&C repeated R&G?s study using a subset
of 30 of the original word pairs, and their resulting
similarity norms correlated to the R&G norms at
r = 0.97. Resnik?s (1995) subsequent replication
of M&C?s study similarly yielded a correlation of
r = 0.96. The M&C pairs were also included in a
similarity study by Finkelstein et al (2002), which
yielded correlation of r = 0.95 to the M&C norms.
2.1 WordSim353
WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al, 2002) has re-
cently emerged as a potential surrogate dataset for
evaluating relatedness measures. Several studies
have reported correlation to WordSim353 norms
as part of their evaluation procedures, with some
studies explicitly referring to it as a collection of
human-assigned relatedness scores (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007; Hughes and Ramage,
2007; Milne and Witten, 2008).
890
Yet, the instructions presented to Finkelstein et
al.?s subjects give us pause to reconsider Word-
Sim353?s classification as a set of relatedness
norms. They repeatedly framed the task as one in
which subjects were expected to assign word simi-
larity scores, although participants were instructed
to extend their definition of similarity to include
antonymy, which perhaps explains why the au-
thors later referred to their data as ?relatedness?
norms rather than merely ?similarity? norms.
Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) have raised fur-
ther methodological concerns about the construc-
tion of WordSim353, including: (a) similarity was
rated on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0, which is intrin-
sically more difficult for humans to manage than
the scale of 0.0 to 4.0 used by R&G and M&C,
and (b) the inclusion of proper nouns introduced
an element of cultural bias into the dataset (e.g.,
the evaluation of the pair Arafat?terror).
Cognizant of the problematic conflation of sim-
ilarity and relatedness in WordSim353, Agirre et
al. (2009) partitioned the data into two sets:
one containing noun pairs exhibiting similarity,
and one containing pairs of related but dissimilar
nouns. However, pairs in the latter set were not
assessed for scoring distribution validity to ensure
that strongly related word pairs were not penalized
by human subjects for being dissimilar.1
3 Methodology
In our experiments, we elicited human ratings of
semantic relatedness for 122 noun pairs. In doing
so, we followed the methodology of Rubenstein
and Goodenough (1965) as closely as possible:
participants were instructed to read through a set
of noun pairs, sort them by how strongly related
they were, and then assign each pair a relatedness
score on a scale of 0.0 (?completely unrelated?) to
4.0 (?very strongly related?).
We made two notable modifications to the ex-
perimental procedure of Rubenstein and Goode-
nough. First, instead of asking participants to
judge ?amount of ?similarity of meaning,?? we
asked them to judge ?how closely related in mean-
ing? each pair of nouns was. Second, we used a
Web interface to collect data in our study; instead
of reordering a deck of cards, participants were
presented with a grid of cards that they were able
1Perhaps not surprisingly, the highest scores in Word-
Sim353 (all ratings from 9.0 to 10.0) were assigned to pairs
that Agirre et al placed in their similarity partition.
to rearrange interactively with the use of a mouse
or any touch-enabled device, such as a tablet PC.2
3.1 Experimental Conditions
Each participant in our study was randomly as-
signed to one of four conditions. Each condition
contained 32 noun pairs for evaluation.
Of those pairs, 10 were randomly selected
from from WordNet++ (Ponzetto and Navigli,
2010) and 10 from SGN (Szumlanski and Gomez,
2010)?two semantic networks that categori-
cally indicate strong relatedness between Word-
Net noun senses. 10 additional pairs were gen-
erated by randomly pairing words from a list of
all nouns occurring in Wikipedia. The nouns
in the pairs we used from each of these three
sources were matched for frequency of occurrence
in Wikipedia.
We manually selected two additional pairs that
appeared across all four conditions: leaves?rake
and lion?cage. These control pairs were included
to ensure that each condition contained examples
of strong semantic relatedness, and potentially to
help identify and eliminate data from participants
who assigned random relatedness scores. Within
each condition, the 32 word pairs were presented
to all subjects in the same random order. Across
conditions, the two control pairs were always pre-
sented in the same positions in the word pair grid.
Each word pair was subjected to additional
scrutiny before being included in our dataset. We
eliminated any pairs falling into one or more
of the following categories: (a) pairs containing
proper nouns, (b) pairs in which one or both nouns
might easily be mistaken for adjectives or verbs,
(c) pairs with advanced vocabulary or words that
might require domain-specific knowledge in or-
der to be properly evaluated, and (d) pairs with
shared stems or common head nouns (e.g., first
cousin?second cousin and sinner?sinning). The
latter were eliminated to prevent subjects from
latching onto superficial lexical commonalities as
indicators of strong semantic relatedness without
reflecting upon meaning.
3.2 Participants
Participants in our study were recruited from in-
troductory undergraduate courses in psychology
and computer science at the University of Cen-
tral Florida. Students from the psychology courses

participated for course credit and accounted for
89% of respondents.
92 participants provided data for our study. Of
these, we identified 19 as outliers, and their data
were excluded from our norms to prevent interfer-
ence from individuals who appeared to be assign-
ing random scores to noun pairs. We considered
an outlier to be any individual whose numeric rat-
ings fell outside two standard deviations from the
means for more than 10% of the word pairs they
evaluated (i.e., at least four word pairs, since each
condition contained 32 word pairs).
For outlier detection, means and standard de-
viations were computed using leave-one-out sam-
pling. That is, data from individual J were not in-
corporated into means or standard deviations when
considering whether to eliminate J as an outlier.3
Of the 73 participants remaining after outlier
elimination, there was a near-even split between
males (37) and females (35), with one individual
declining to provide any demographic data. The
average age of participants was 20.32 (? = 4.08,
N = 72). Most students were freshmen (49), fol-
lowed in frequency by sophomores (16), seniors
(4), and juniors (3). Participants earned an average
score of 42% on a standardized test of advanced
vocabulary (? = 16%, N = 72) (Test I ? V-4 from
Ekstrom et al (1976)).
4 Results
Each word pair in Rel-122 was evaluated by at
least 20 human subjects. After outlier removal
(described above), each word pair retained eval-
uations from 14 to 22 individuals. The resulting
relatedness means are available online.4
An excerpt of the Rel-122 norms is shown in
Table 1. We note that the highest rated pairs in our
dataset are not strictly similar entities; exactly half
of the 10 most strongly related nouns in Table 1 are
dissimilar (e.g., digital camera?photographer).
Judgments from individual subjects in our study
exhibited high average correlation to the elicited
relatedness means (r = 0.769, ? = 0.09, N =
73). Resnik (1995), in his replication of the
3We used this sampling method to prevent extreme out-
liers from masking their own aberration during outlier de-
tection, which is potentially problematic when dealing with
small populations. Without leave-one-out-sampling, we
would have identified fewer outliers (14 instead of 19), but
the resulting means would still have correlated strongly to
our final relatedness norms (r = 0.991, p < 0.01).

M&C study, reported average individual correla-
tion of r = 0.90 (? = 0.07, N = 10) to similar-
ity means elicited from a population of 10 gradu-
ate students and postdoctoral researchers. Presum-
ably Resnik?s subjects had advanced knowledge of
what constitutes semantic similarity, as he estab-
lished r = 0.90 as an upper bound for expected
human correlation on that task.
The fact that average human correlation in our
study is weaker than in previous studies suggests
that human perceptions of relatedness are less
strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity,
and that a reasonable computational measure of re-
latedness might only approach a correlation of r =
0.769 to relatedness norms.
In Table 2, we present the performance of a va-
riety of relatedness and similarity measures on our
new set of relatedness means.5 Coefficients of cor-
relation are given for Pearson?s product-moment
correlation (r), as well as Spearman?s rank corre-
lation (?). For comparison, we include results for
the correlation of these measures to the M&C and
R&G similarity means.
The generally weak performance of the
WordNet-based measures on this task is not
surprising, given WordNet?s strong disposition
toward codifying semantic similarity, which
makes it an impoverished resource for discovering
general semantic relatedness. We note that the
three WordNet-based measures from Table 2

measures (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; Hirst and
St-Onge, 1998; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006)

have been hampered by their reliance upon Word-
Net. The disparity between their performance on
Rel-122 and the M&C and R&G norms suggests
the shortcomings of using similarity norms for
evaluating measures of relatedness.
5 (Re-)Evaluating Similarity Norms
After establishing our relatedness norms, we cre-
ated two additional experimental conditions in
which subjects evaluated the relatedness of noun
pairs from the M&C study. Each condition again
had 32 noun pairs: 15 from M&C and 17 from
Rel-122. Pairs from M&C and Rel-122 were uni-
formly distributed between these two new condi-
tions based on matched normative similarity or re-
latedness scores from their respective datasets.
Results from this second phase of our study are
shown in Table 3. The correlation of our relat-
edness means on this set to the similarity means
of M&C was strong (r = 0.91), but not as strong
as in replications of the study that asked subjects
to evaluate similarity (e.g. r = 0.96 in Resnik?s
(1995) replication and r = 0.95 in Finkelstein et
al.?s (2002) M&C subset).
That the synonymous M&C pairs garner high
relatedness ratings in our study is not surprising;
strong similarity is, after all, one type of strong
relatedness. The more interesting result from
893
our study, shown in Table 3, is that relatedness
norms for pairs that are related but dissimilar (e.g.,
journey?car and forest?graveyard) deviate signif-
icantly from established similarity norms. This in-
dicates that asking subjects to evaluate ?similar-
ity? instead of ?relatedness? can significantly im-
pact the norms established in such studies.
6 Conclusions
We have established a new set of relatedness
norms, Rel-122, that is offered as a supplementary
evaluative standard for assessing semantic related-
ness measures.
We have also demonstrated the shortcomings
of using similarity norms to evaluate such mea-
sures. Namely, since similarity is only one type of
relatedness, comparison to similarity norms fails
to provide a complete view of a measure?s abil-
ity to capture more general types of relatedness.
This is particularly problematic when evaluating
WordNet-based measures, which naturally excel at
capturing similarity, given the nature of the Word-
Net ontology.
Furthermore, we have found that asking judges
to evaluate ?relatedness? of terms, rather than
?similarity,? has a substantive impact on resulting
norms, particularly with respect to the M&C sim-
ilarity dataset. Correlation of individual judges?
ratings to resulting means was also significantly
lower on average in our study than in previous
studies that focused on similarity (e.g., Resnik,
1995). These results suggest that human percep-
tions of relatedness are less strictly constrained
than perceptions of similarity and validate the
need for new relatedness norms to supplement ex-
isting gold standard similarity norms in the evalu-
ation of relatedness measures.
