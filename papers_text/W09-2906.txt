Abstract 
Complex predicate is a noun, a verb, an ad-
jective or an adverb followed by a light verb 
that behaves as a single unit of verb. Com-
plex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in 
Hindi and other languages of Indo Aryan 
family.  Detecting and interpreting CPs con-
stitute an important and somewhat a diffi-
cult task. The linguistic and statistical 
methods have yielded limited success in 
mining this data. In this paper, we present a 
simple method for detecting CPs of all kinds 
using a Hindi-English parallel corpus. A CP 
is hypothesized by detecting absence of the 
conventional meaning of the light verb in 
the aligned English sentence. This simple 
strategy exploits the fact that CP is a multi-
word expression with a meaning that is dis-
tinct from the meaning of the light verb. Al-
though there are several shortcomings in the 
methodology, this empirical method surpri-
singly yields mining of CPs with an average 
precision of 89% and a recall of 90%.   
1 Introduction 
Complex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in 
Hindi and other languages of Indo-Aryan family 
and have been widely studied (Hook, 1974; Ab-
bi, 1992; Verma, 1993; Mohanan, 1994; Singh, 
1994; Butt, 1995; Butt and Geuder, 2001; Butt 
and Ramchand, 2001; Butt et al, 2003). A com-
plex predicate is a multi-word expression 
(MWE) where a noun, a verb or an adjective is 
followed by a light verb (LV) and the MWE be-
haves as a single unit of verb. The general theory 
of complex predicate is discussed in Alsina 
(1996).  These studies attempt to model the lin-
guistic facts of complex predicate formation and 
the associated semantic roles. 
CPs empower the language in its expressive-
ness but are hard to detect. Detection and inter-
pretation of CPs are important for several tasks 
of natural language processing tasks such as ma-
chine translation, information retrieval, summa-
rization etc. A mere listing of the CPs constitutes 
a valuable linguistic resource for lexicographers, 
wordnet designers (Chakrabarti et al, 2007) and 
other NLP system designers. Computational me-
thod using Hindi corpus has been used to mine 
CPs and categorize them based on statistical 
analysis (Sriram and Joshi, 2005) with limited 
success. Chakrabarti et al (2008) present a me-
thod for automatic extraction of V+V CPs only 
from a corpus based on linguistic features. They 
report an accuracy of about 98%.  An attempt has 
also been made to use a parallel corpus for de-
tecting CPs using projection POS tags from Eng-
lish to Hindi (Soni, Mukerjee and Raina, 2006). 
It uses Giza++ word alignment tool to align the 
projected POS information. A success of 83% 
precision and 46% recall has been reported.  
In this paper, we present a simple strategy for 
mining of CPs in Hindi using projection of 
meaning of light verb in a parallel corpus. In the 
following section the nature of CP in Hindi is 
outlined and this is followed by system design, 
experimentation and results. 
2 Complex Predicates in Hindi   
A CP in Hindi is a syntactic construction consist-
ing of either  a verb, a noun, an adjective or an 
adverb as main predicator followed by a light 
verb (LV). Thus, a CP can be a noun+LV, an 
adjective+LV, a verb+LV or an adverb+LV. Fur-
ther, it is also possible that a CP is followed by a 
LV (CP+LV). The light verb carries the tense 
and agreement morphology.  In V+V CPs, the 
contribution of the light verb denotes aspectual 
terms such as continuity, perfectivity, inception, 
completion, or denotes an expression of forceful-
ness, suddenness, etc. (Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995). 
The CP in a sentence syntactically acts as a sin-
gle lexical unit of verb that has a meaning dis-
40
tinct from that of the LV. CPs are also referred as 
the complex or compound verbs.   
Given below are some examples: 
 
(1): CP=noun+LV 
noun = ashirwad {blessings} 
LV = denaa {to give} 
usane mujhe ashirwad diyaa. 
???? ??? ??????? ???? 
{he     me   blessings  gave} 
he blessed me. 
 
(2) No CP 
usane mujhe ek pustak dii. 
???? ??? ??? ????? ?? 
{he    me  one  book  gave} 
he gave me a book. 
 
In (1), the light verb diyaa (gave) in its past tense 
form with the noun ashirwad (blessings) makes a 
complex predicate verb form ashirwad diyaa 
(blessed) in the past tense form.  The CP here is 
ashirwad denaa and its corresponding English 
translation is ?to bless?. On the other hand in ex-
ample (2), the verb  dii (gave) is a simple verb in 
past tense form and is not a light verb. Although, 
same Hindi verb denaa (to give) is used in both 
the examples, it is a light verb in (1) and a main 
verb in (2). Whether it acts as a light verb or not, 
depends upon the semantics of the preceding 
noun. However, it is observed that the English 
meaning in case of the complex predicate is not 
derived from the individual meanings of the con-
stituent words. It is this observation that forms 
basis of our approach for mining of CPs. 
 
(3) CP=adjective+LV 
adjective=khush {happy} 
LV=karanaa {to do} 
usane mujhe khush kiyaa. 
???? ??? ???? ???? 
{he   me  happy did} 
he pleased me. 
 
Here the Hindi verb kiyaa (did) is the past tense 
form of a light verb karanaa (to do) and the pre-
ceding word khush (happy) is an adjective. The 
CP here is khush karanaa (to please). 
 
(4) CP=verb+LV 
verb = paRhnaa {to read} 
LV = lenaa {to take} 
usane pustak paRh liyaa. 
???? ????? ?? ???? 
{he    book  read took} 
he has read  the book. 
 
Here the Hindi verb liyaa (took) is the past tense 
form of the light verb lenaa (to take) and the pre-
ceding word paRh (read) is the verb paRhnaa (to 
read) in its stem form. The CP is paRh lenaa (to 
finish reading). In such cases the light verb acts 
as an aspectual /modal or as an intensifier.  
 
(5) CP=verb+LV 
verb = phaadanaa {to tear} 
LV = denaa {to give} 
usane pustak phaad diyaa. 
???? ????? ??? ???? 
{he    book   tear  gave} 
he has torn  the book. 
 
Here the Hindi verb diyaa (gave) is the past tense 
form of the light verb denaa (to give) and the 
preceding word phaad (tear) is the stem form of 
the  verb phaadanaa (to tear) . The CP is phaad 
denaa (to cause and complete act of tearing).  
 
(6) CP=verb+LV 
verb = denaa {to give} 
LV = maaranaa{to hit/ to kill} 
usane pustak de maaraa. 
???? ????? ?? ????  
{he   book  give  hit} 
he threw the book. 
 
Here the Hindi verb maaraa (hit/killed) is the 
past tense form of the light verb maaranaa (to 
hit/ to kill) and the preceding word de (give) is a 
verb denaa (to give) in its stem form. The CP is 
de maranaa (to throw). The verb combination 
yields a new meaning. This may also be consi-
dered as a semi-idiomatic construct by some 
people. 
 
(7) CP=adverb+LV1+LV2 
adverb = vaapas{back} 
LV1 = karanaa{to do} 
LV2 = denaa{to give} 
or 
CP = CP+LV 
CP = vaapas karanaa{to return} 
LV = denaa{to give} 
usane pustak vaapas kar  diyaa. 
???? ????? ???? ?? ???? 
{he    book   back   do  gave} 
41
he returned the book. 
 
Here there are two Hindi light verbs used. The 
verb kar (do) is the stem form of the light verb 
karanaa (to do) and the verb diyaa (gave) is the 
past tense form of the light verb denaa (to give). 
The preceding word vaapas (back) is an adverb. 
One way of interpretation is that the CP (a con-
junct verb) vaapas karanaa (to return) is fol-
lowed by another LV denaa (to give) signifying 
completion of the task. Another way of looking 
at it is to consider these as a combination of two 
CPs, vaapas karanaa (to return) and kar denaa 
(to complete the act). The semantic interpreta-
tions in the two cases remain the same. It may be 
noted that the word vaapas (return) is also a noun 
and in such a case the CP is a noun+LV. 
 
From all the above examples, the complexity 
of the task of mining the CPs is evident. Howev-
er, it is also observed that in the translated text, 
the meaning of the light verb does not appear in 
case of CPs. Our methodology for mining CPs is 
based on this observation and is outlined in the 
following section.  
3 System Design 
As outlined earlier, our method for detecting a 
CP is based on detecting a mismatch of the Hindi 
light verb meaning in the aligned English sen-
tence. The steps involved are as follows: 
1) Align the sentences of Hindi-English corpus; 
2) Create a list of Hindi light verbs and their 
common English meanings as a simple verb; 
(Table 1) 
3) For each Hindi light verb, generate all the 
morphological forms (Figure 1); 
4) For each English meaning of the light verb as 
given in table 1, generate all the morphologi-
cal forms (Figure 2); 
5) For each Hindi-English aligned sentence, 
execute the following steps: 
a) For each light verb of Hindi (table 1), 
execute the following steps:  
i) Search for a Hindi light verb (LV) 
and its morphological derivatives 
(figure 1) in the Hindi sentence and 
mark its position in the sentence (K); 
ii) If the LV or its morphological deriv-
ative is found, then search for the 
equivalent English meanings for any 
of the morphological forms (figure 
2) in the corresponding aligned Eng-
lish sentence; 
iii) If no match is found, then scan the 
words in the Hindi sentence to the 
left of the Kth position (as identified 
in step (i)); else if a match is found, 
then exit {i.e. go to step (a)}. 
iv) If the scanned word is a ?stop word? 
(figure 3), then ignore it and contin-
ue scanning; 
v) Stop the scan when it is not a ?stop 
word? and collect the Hindi word 
(W); 
vi) If W is an ?exit word? then exit {i.e. 
go to step (a)}, else the identified CP 
is W+LV. 
Hindi has a large number of light verbs. A list 
of some of the commonly used light verbs along 
with their common English meanings as a simple 
verb is given in table 1. The light verb kar (do) is 
the most frequently used light verb. Using its 
literal meaning as ?do?, as a criterion for testing 
CP is quite misleading since ?do? in English is 
used in several other contexts. Such meanings 
have been shown within parentheses and are not 
used for matching.

baithanaa ????? sit 
bananaa ???? make/become/build/construct/

Table 1. Some of the common light verbs in Hindi 
42
For each of the Hindi light verb, all morpho-
logical forms are generated. A few illustrations 
are given in figures 1(a) and 1(b). Similarly, for 
each of the English meaning of the light verb, all 
of its morphological derivatives are generated. 
Figure 2 shows a few illustrations of the same. 
There are a number of words that can appear 
in between the nominal and the light verb in a 
CP. These words are ignored in search for a CP 
and are treated as stop words. These are words 
that denote negation or are emphasizers, inten-
sifiers, interrogative pronoun or a particle. A list 
of stop words used in the experimentation is giv-
en in figure 3.

We use a list of words of words that we have 
named as ?exit words? which cannot form part of 
a CP in Hindi. We have used Hindi case (vibhak-
ti) markers (also called parsarg), conjunctions 
and pronouns as the ?exit words? in our imple-
mentation. Figure 4 shows a partial list used. 
However, this list can be augmented based on 
analysis of errors in LV identification. It should 
be noted that we do not perform parts of speech 
(POS) tagging and so the nature of the word pre-
ceding the LV is unknown to the system.

The inner loop of the procedure identifies mul-
tiple CPs that may be present in a sentence. The 
outer loop is for mining the CPs in the entire 
corpus. The experimentation and results are dis-
cussed in the following section. 
4 Experimentation and Results  
The CP mining methodology outlined earlier has 
been implemented and tested over multiple files 
of EMILLE  (McEnery, Baker, Gaizauskas and 
Cunningham, 2000) English-Hindi parallel cor-
pus. A summary of the results obtained are given 
in table 2. As can be seen from this table, the 
precision obtained is 80% to 92% and the recall 
is between 89% to 100%. The F-measure is 88% 
to 97%. This is a remarkable and somewhat sur-
prising result from the simple methodology 
without much of linguistic or statistical analysis. 
This is much higher than what has been reported 
on the same corpus by Mukerjee et al 2006 
(83% precision and 46% recall) who use projec-
tion of POS and word alignment for CP identifi-
cation. This is the only other work that uses a 
parallel corpus and covers all kinds of CPs. The 
results as reported by Chakrabarti et al (2008) 
are only for V-V CPs. Moreover they do not re-
port the recall value.

Given below are some sample outputs: 
 
(1) 
English sentence: 
I also enjoy working with the children's parents 
who often come to me for advice - it's good to 
know you can help. 
  
Aligned Hindi sentence: 
???? ???? ?? ???? - ????? ? ?? ??? ??? ???? ?? 
???? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ???? ???? ??? ?? - ?? 
?????? ???? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? 
?? | 
 
The CPs identified in the sentence:  
i. ??? ???? (to work), ii. ???? ???? (to feel 
good: enjoy), iii. ???? ???? (to seek advice), iv. 
???? ???? (to feel happy: good), v. ??? ???? (to 
help) 
 
Here the system identified 5 different CPs all 
of which are correct and no CP in the sentence 
has gone undetected. The POS projection and 
word alignment method (Mukerjee et al, 2006) 
would fail to identify  CPs ???? ???? (to seek 
advice), and ???? ???? (to feel happy). 
 
(2) 
English sentence: 
Thousands of children are already benefiting 
from the input of people like you - people who 
care about children and their future, who have 
the commitment, energy and enthusiasm to be 
positive role models, and who value the opportu-
nity for a worthwhile career. 
 
Aligned Hindi sentence: 
?? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?? ???? ????? ?? ???? ?? 
????? ?? - ?? ??? ?? ????? ???? ?? ??? ?????? ??? 
?? |  ???? ???[ ???? ?? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??????? 
, ?????? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???[? - ???? 
?????? ?? ?? ???? ?? | 
 
The CPs identified in the sentence: 
i. ???[ ???? (to be role model), ii. ?? ???? (to 
respect)  
 
Here also the two CPs identified are correct. 
    
It is obvious that this empirical method of 
mining CPs will fail whenever the Hindi light 
verb maps on to its core meaning in English. It 
may also produce garbage as POS of the preced-
ing word is not being checked. However, the 
mining success rate obtained speaks of these be-
ing in small numbers in practice.  Use of the 
?stop words? in allowing the intervening words 
within the CPs helps a lot in improving the per-
formance. Similarly, use of the ?exit words? 
avoid a lot of incorrect identification.   
5 Conclusions 
The simple empirical method for mining CPs 
outlined in this work, yields an average 89% of 
precision and 90% recall which is better than the 
results reported so far in the literature. The major 
drawback is that we have to generate a list of all 
possible light verbs. This list appears to be very 
large for Hindi. Since no POS tagging or statis-
tical analysis is performed, the identified CPs are 
merely a list of mined CPs in Hindi with no lin-
guistic categorization or analysis. However, this 
list of mined CPs is valuable to the lexicograph-
ers and other language technology developers. 
This list can also be used for word alignment 
tools where the identified components of CPs are 
grouped together before the word alignment 
process. This will increase both the alignment 
accuracy and the speed. 
The methodology presented in this work is 
equally applicable to all other languages within 
the Indo-Aryan family.
