Abstract
We have implemented a rule-based proto-
type of a Spanish-to-Cuzco Quechua MT
system enhanced through the addition of
statistical components. The greatest dif-
ficulty during the translation process is to
generate the correct Quechua verb form in
subordinated clauses. The prototype has
several rules that decide which verb form
should be used in a given context. How-
ever, matching the context in order to ap-
ply the correct rule depends crucially on
the parsing quality of the Spanish input.
As the form of the subordinated verb de-
pends heavily on the conjunction in the
subordinated Spanish clause and the se-
mantics of the main verb, we extracted
this information from two treebanks and
trained different classifiers on this data.
We tested the best classifier on a set of 4
texts, increasing the correct subordinated
verb forms from 80% to 89%.
1 Introduction
As part of our research project SQUOIA,1 we have
developed several tools and resources for Cuzco
Quechua. These include a treebank, currently con-
sisting of around 500 sentences2, and a rule-based
MT system Spanish-Cuzco Quechua. The tree-
bank is currently being enhanced with more anno-
tated text and should reach about 4000 sentences
upon project completion.
As for the translation system, we want to en-
hance the rule-based approach with statistical
methods to overcome certain limitations of the
prototype. The main reason to build the core

system with a rule-based architecture is the lack
of parallel texts in Spanish and Quechua; there
is not enough parallel material to train a statisti-
cal MT system of acceptable quality, as Mohler
and Mihalcea (2008) showed in their experiments.
They trained an SMT system Spanish-Quechua on
translations of the Bible, resulting in 2.89 BLEU
points. By increasing the size of their train-
ing corpus with web-crawled parallel texts and
additional Bible translations, they achieved 4.55
BLEU points.3 Although better, the overall qual-
ity of the SMT system is still very low.
There are at least two other projects that started
the implementation of MT systems for the same
language pair, but in the opposite direction; the
AVENUE project4 used elicited corpora to build
an MT system Quechua-Spanish. Furthermore,
the language pair Quechua-Spanish has recently
been added to the open-source MT platform Aper-
tium.5 The translation system is still at a very early
stage in its development; at present, the grammar
contains 30 transfer rules and a morphological an-
alyzer.
2 Hybrid MT Spanish-Cuzco Quechua
The core of our own Spanish-Quechua MT sys-
tem is a classical rule-based transfer engine, based
on a reimplementation of the Matxin6 framework
that was originally developed for the translation of
Spanish to Basque (Mayor et al, 2012). As not
all of the necessary disambiguation can be done
satisfactorily with rules alone, we plan to add sta-
tistical modules at different stages of the transfer
to resolve the remaining ambiguities. The mod-
ule for the disambiguation of subordinated verb

forms described in this paper is the first statistical
enhancement to the rule-based prototype.
3 Quechua verb forms
Subordinated clauses in Quechua are often non-
finite, nominal forms. There are several nomi-
nalizing suffixes that are used for different clause
types that will be illustrated in more detail in this
section.
3.1 Switch-Reference
A common type of subordination in Quechua
is the so-called switch-reference: the subordi-
nated, non-finite verb bears a suffix that indicates
whether its subject is the same as in the main
clause or not. If the subject in the subordinated
clause is different, the non-finite verb bears a pos-
sessive suffix that indicates the subject person.
Consider the following examples7
Same subject: Mikhuspa hamuni.
(1) Mikhu
eat
-spa
-SS
hamu
come
-ni.
-1.Sg
?When I finished eating, I?ll come.?
(lit. ?My eating, I come.?)
Different subject: Mikhuchkaptiy pasakura.
(2) Mikhu
eat
-chka
-Prog
-pti
-DS
-y
-1.Sg.Poss
pasa
leave
-ku
-Rflx
-ra
-Pst
-?.
-3.Sg
?While I was eating, he left.?
(lit. ?[During] my eating, he left.?)
(Dedenbach-Salazar Sa?enz et al, 2002, 168)
In the Spanish source language, subordinated
verbs are usually finite. An overt subject is not
necessary, as personal pronouns are used only for
emphasis (?pro-drop?). In order to generate the
correct verb form, we need to find the subject
of the subordinated verb and compare it to the
main verb. For this reason, we included a mod-
ule that performs co-reference resolution on sub-
jects. So far, the procedure is based on the sim-
ple assumption that an elided subject is coreferent

Perf: perfect Poss: possessive

with the previous explicit subject, if this subject
agrees in number and person with the current verb.
Of course, there are some exceptions that have to
be considered, e.g. the subject of a verb in direct
speech is not a good antecedent.
3.2 Other Types of Subordination
Generally, the relation of the subordinated clause
to the main clause is expressed through different
conjunctions in Spanish. In Quechua, on the other
hand, a specific verb form in combination with a
case suffix indicates the type of subordination. For
example, Spanish para que - ?in order to? has to
be translated with a nominal verb form with the
suffix -na and the case suffix -paq (usually called
benefactive, ?for?):
(3) Ventanata kichay wayraq haykurimunanpaq.
Ventana
window
-ta
-Acc
kicha
open
-y
-2.Sg.Imp
wayra
wind
-q
-Gen
hayku
enter
-ri
-Inch
-mu
-Dir
-na
-Obl
-n
-3.Sg.Poss
-paq.
-Ben
?Open the window, so the air comes in.?
(lit. ?Open the window for his entering of the wind?)
(Cusihuama?n, 1976, 210)
Finite verb forms are also possible in subordi-
nated clauses; in this case, the relation of the sub-
ordinated and the main clause is indicated through
a ?linker?. A linker often consists of a demon-
strative pronoun combined with case suffixes or
so-called independent suffixes; these are special
suffixes that can be attached to any word class
and their position is usually at the end of the suf-
fix sequence. The functions of the independent
suffixes include data source, polar question mark-
ing and topic or contrast, amongst others (Adelaar
and Muysken, 2004, 209). In combination with
demonstrative pronouns, the independent suffixes
are used for linking clauses, similar to Spanish or
English conjunctions. For example, the combina-
tion of demonstrative chay - ?this? with the topic
marker -qa, chayqa, is used in the sense of ?if, in
case that?:
(4) Munanki chayqa, Arekipatapis rinki makinapi.
Muna
want
-nki
-2.Sg
chay
this
-qa,
-Top
Arekipa
Arequipa
-ta
-Acc
-pis
-Add
ri
go
-nki
-2.Sg
makina
machine
-pi.
-Loc
?If you like, you can also go to Arequipa by train
(machine).?
(Cusihuama?n, 1976, 264)
A special case is indirect speech in the Spanish
source text; the Quechua equivalence of indirect
14
speech is direct speech. The conversion from in-
direct to direct speech is not trivial, because coref-
erence resolution for the subject is required: if the
subject of the main verb is the same as in the indi-
rect speech clause, the verb has to be generated as
first person form in direct speech.8
Furthermore, the form of the subordinated verb
may also depend on the semantics of the main
verb, e.g. complement clauses of control verbs
usually require -na, whereas with other verbs, the
nominalizer -sqa is used:
(5) Ri
go
-na
-Obl
-yki
-2.Sg.Poss
-ta
-Acc
muna
want
-ni.
-1.Sg
?I want you to leave.?
(lit. ?I want your going.?)
(6) Ama
don?t
-n
-DirE
chay
this
yacha
know
-sqa
-Perf
-yki
-2.Sg.Poss
-ta
-Acc
qunqa
forget
-nki
-2.Sg
-chu.
-Neg
?Don?t forget what you learned.?
(lit. ?Don?t forget those your learnings.?)
(Cusihuama?n, 1976, 125)
For all of these cases, the rule-based prototype
has a set of rules to match the given context, so
that the correct form can be assigned to each verb.
3.3 Relative Clauses
A special case of subordination are relative
clauses; the verb in the relative clause is a nom-
inal form that is either agentive or non-agentive.
The form depends on the semantics of the nomi-
nal head and its semantic role within the relative
clause. The MT system includes a specific rule-
based module that uses semantic resources for the
disambiguation of relative clauses. As their form
does not depend on the main verb, relative clauses
will not be discussed further in this paper.
4 Rule-based Disambiguation of Verb
Forms
The disambiguation of subordinated verb forms
depends on the previously described steps: the dis-
ambiguation of Spanish relative clauses, corefer-
ence resolution of subjects, the recognition of the
given type of subordination through the Spanish
conjunction and the semantics of the main verb.
Such a rule-based approach is prone to error, since
8consider this English example:
?John said he wanted to go fishing.?
if John = he : ?I want to go fishing?, John said.
if John 6= he: ?He wants to go fishing?, John said.

it depends crucially on correct parse trees and cor-
rectly tagged verbs and conjunctions. As a pre-
caution, we only use rule-based disambiguation in
cases that can be safely disambiguated, i.e. if we
find the main verb and the Spanish conjunction
in the parse tree where they are to be expected.
An evaluation on four texts from different gen-
res9 shows that the rule-based module can disam-
biguate 85% of the verb forms; of these, 94% are
correct (see Table 1 for details).
For subordinated clauses that cannot be disam-
biguated with rules (15% in the 4 texts used for
evaluation), we use the machine learning approach
described in the following section.
5 Disambiguation with Machine
Learning
5.1 Training Corpus
As the form of the subordinated verb depends
mainly on the semantics of the main verb and the
Spanish conjunction in the source text, we trained
and evaluated different classifiers based on these
features.
We extracted all verb pairs from our Quechua
treebank with their corresponding forms and, if
present, the linker. The Quechua roots in the tree-
bank contain one or more Spanish translations.
We used the Spanish lemmas to create the in-
stances for training, as we might not have access
to the Quechua translation of the Spanish verb dur-
ing the transfer. Furthermore, we use the stan-
dardized Southern Quechua orthography (Cerro?n-
Palomino, 1994) in our translation system; how-
ever, the text in the treebank is written in a slightly

different spelling. By using the Spanish version of
the verbs, we avoid mapping the Quechua verbs
obtained from the transfer to the orthography used
in the treebank. Since most Quechua roots in the
treebank contain more than one Spanish transla-
tion, we can create an instance for every combi-
nation of the Spanish translations. With this ap-
proach we extracted 444 instances from our tree-
bank.
Since this initial training set was too small to
yield satisfactory results,10 we added synthetic
training data created from the translation of the
Spanish AnCora treebank (Taule? et al, 2008) with
the prototype. As the dependencies in AnCora are
correctly annotated, the rules of the MT system
will assign the correct Quechua verb forms with
high precision. We used these verb forms as ad-
ditional instances for training the classifiers. The
total number of instances obtained from AnCora
amounts to 7366.
5.2 Setup
We used WEKA (Hall et al, 2009) and
SVMmulticlass (Joachims, 1999) to compute the
machine learning models for our disambiguation
task. We trained different classifiers on 7810 in-
stances extracted from a Quechua and a translated
Spanish treebank. The class variable form repre-
sents the form of the subordinated verb; there are
5 different classes:11
? perfect: nominal form with -sqa
? obligative: nominal form with -na
? agentive: nominal form with -q
? switch: nominal forms with -pti/spa
? finite
5.3 Evaluation
We tested the classifiers on the ambiguous forms
from the 4 texts that we used for the evaluation
of the rule-based approach (see Table 1). Addi-
tionally, we extracted verb pairs from Quechua
texts (with their Spanish translations) and as-
signed them the corresponding class number. With
this procedure, we collected 100 instances for
testing. We trained and tested different classi-
fiers: Na??ve Bayes, Nearest Neighbour (Martin,
1995) and a multiclass support vector machine
1036% accuracy achieved with Naive Bayes, on the same
test set used in the final evaluation (see Table 2).
11Every instance contains the lemma of the main verb, the
lemma of the subordinated verb, the linker and a number rep-
resenting one of the 5 classes.
(Joachims, 1999). Table 2 contains the best results
for each classifier. The three WEKA classifiers
were trained with default settings, whereas for
SVMmulticlass we obtained the best results with
=0.1 and c=0.02 (linear kernel).
In an ideal case of disambiguation during trans-
lation, we would have information about the
lemma of the main verb (?head?) and the Span-
ish conjunction (?linker?).12 In these ideal cases,
we use the rule-based module to assign the sub-
ordinated verb form. In real translation scenar-
ios, however, either the head or linker might be
missing; a common source for errors are polyse-
mous conjunctions, such as que - ?that? or como -
?as? , that the tagger erroneously labeled as rela-
tive pronoun or preposition, respectively. In this
case, the linker cannot be retrieved from the parse
tree and we have to guess the verb form based
only on the lemmas of the main and the subordi-
nated verb (?subV?). Furthermore, we might have
a clearly subordinated verb form with a linker that
the parser attached to the wrong head. Finding
the correct head automatically is not always possi-
ble, especially within coordinations. In this case,
we need to guess the verb form based only on the
lemma of the subordinated verb and the linker.
Na??ve Bayes achieves the highest scores, both
on cross validation and on the test set (see Table 2
for details). From the 33 ambiguous verb forms in
Table 1, only 22 were disambiguated with the clas-
sifiers, as the rest were either nouns erroneously
tagged as verbs or had the wrong lemma, and
therefore can be counted as false without further
processing. From the 22 correctly tagged ambigu-
ous verbs, Na??ve Bayes classified 20 instances cor-
rectly. The rules of the MT system disambiguated
80% of the verb forms in the 4 evaluation texts
correctly. Feeding the remaining ambiguous verbs
to the classifier; we achieve an overall accuracy of
89% (see the results in Table 3).
The complete translation pipeline including the
Naive Bayes classifier is illustrated in Fig. 1.
6 Concluding remarks
We enhanced a purely rule-based machine trans-
lation system for the language pair Spanish-
Quechua with a classifier that predicts the form
of subordinated verbs in the target language
Quechua, based on information collected from the

Spanish input text. The MT system has rules to
match the context of the subordinated verb and
assign a verb form for generation. Due to pars-
ing and tagging errors, the information needed for
rule-based disambiguation cannot always be re-
trieved. In order to disambiguate these forms, we
use a classifier that predicts the verb form even if
all of the context information is not accessible. We
tested three different machine learning algorithms,
out of which Na??ve Bayes achieved the best re-
sults. In an evaluation on 4 texts from different
genres, verb disambiguation was improved from
80% (purely rule-based) to 89%, with a combina-
tion of the rule-based module and the Na??ve Bayes
classifier.
