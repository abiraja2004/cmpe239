Abstract
We examine evaluation methods for systems
that automatically annotate images using co-
occurring text. We compare previous datasets
for this task using a series of baseline mea-
sures inspired by those used in information re-
trieval, computer vision, and extractive sum-
marization. Some of our baselines match or
exceed the best published scores for those
datasets. These results illuminate incorrect as-
sumptions and improper practices regarding
preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and the col-
lection of gold image annotations. We con-
clude with a list of recommended practices for
future research combining language and vi-
sion processing techniques.
1 Introduction
Automatic image annotation is an important area
with many applications such as tagging, generat-
ing captions, and indexing and retrieval on the web.
Given an input image, the goal is to generate rel-
evant descriptive keywords that describe the visual
content of the image. The Computer Vision (CV)
literature contains countless approaches to this task,
using a wide range of learning techniques and visual
features to identify aspects such as objects, people,
scenes, and events.
Text processing is computationally less expensive
than image processing and easily provides informa-
tion that is difficult to learn visually. For this reason,
most commerical image search websites identify the
semantic content of images using co-occurring text
exclusively. But co-occurring text is also a noisy
source for candidate annotations, since not all of the
text is visually relevant. Techniques from Natural
Language Processing help align descriptive words
and images. Some examples of previous research
use named-entity recognition to identify people in
images (Deschacht and Moens, 2007); term associa-
tion to estimate the ?visualness? of candidate anno-
tations (Boiy et al., 2008; Leong et al., 2010); and
topic models to annotate images given both visual
and textual features (Feng and Lapata, 2010b).
Image annotation using NLP is still an emerging
area with many different tasks, datasets, and eval-
uation methods, making it impossible to compare
many recent systems to each other. Although there is
some effort being made towards establishing shared
tasks1, it is not yet clear which kinds of tasks and
datasets will provide interesting research questions
and practical applications in the long term. Until
then, establishing general ?best practices? for NLP
image annotation will help advance and legitimitize
this work. In this paper, we propose some good prac-
tices and demonstrate why they are important.
2 Image Annotation Evaluation in CV and
NLP
In this section, we first review related work in im-
age annotation evaluation in computer vision, spe-
cific challenges, and proposed solutions. We then
relate these challenges to the NLP image annotation
task and some of the specific problems we propose
to address.

2.1 Related Work in Computer Vision
The work of Mu?ller et al. (2002) is one of the first
to address the issue of evaluation for image annota-
tion systems. While using the exact same annotation
system, dataset, and evaluation metric, they dramati-
cally improve the apparent performance of their sys-
tem by using dataset pruning heuristics.
Others have criticized commonly-used CV
datasets for being too ?easy? ? images with the
same keywords are extremely similar in low-level
features such as orientation, lighting, and color;
while differences between images with different
keywords are very clear (Westerveld and de Vries,
2003; Ponce et al., 2006; Herve? and Boujemaa,
2007; Tang and Lewis, 2007). These features are
unwittingly exploited by certain algorithms and
obscure the benefits of using more complex tech-
niques (Ponce et al., 2006). The problem is further
exacerbated by evaluation metrics which essentially
prefer precision over recall and are biased towards
certain keywords. Annotations in test data might
not include all of the ?correct? keywords, and
evaluation metrics need to account for the fact that
frequent keywords in the corpus are safer guesses
than keywords that appear less frequently (Monay
and Gatica-Perez, 2003).
New baseline techniques, evaluation metrics, and
datasets for image annotation have been developed
in response to these problems. Makadia et al. (2008;
2010) define a basic set of low-level features, and
propose new baselines for more complex systems to
evaluate against. Barnard et al. (2003) present a nor-
malized loss function to address the preference to-
wards precision in evaluation metrics. New datasets
are larger and provide more diverse images, and it is
now easy to obtain multiple human-annotations per
image thanks to distributed services such as Ama-
zon?s Mechanical Turk, and the ESP game (von
Ahn and Dabbish, 2004). Hanbury (2008) provides
an overview of popular CV annotation datasets and
methods used for building them.
2.2 Image Annotation using Natural Language
Processing
Many of the problems from CV image annotation
are also applicable to NLP image annotation, and
bringing NLP to the task brings new challenges as
well. One of these challenges is whether to allow
infrequent words to be pruned. In CV annotation it
is typical to remove infrequent terms from both the
keyword vocabulary and the evaluation data because
CV algorithms typically need a large number of ex-
amples to train on. However, using NLP systems
and baselines one can correctly annotate using key-
words that did not appear in the training set. Remov-
ing ?unlearnable? keywords from evaluation data, as
done in (Boiy et al., 2008; Feng and Lapata, 2010b),
artificially inflates performance against simple base-
lines such as term frequency.
Nearly all NLP annotation datasets use naturally-
occurring sources of images and text. A particu-
larly popular source is news images alongside cap-
tions or articles, which are collected online from
sources such as Yahoo! News (Berg et al., 2004; De-
schacht and Moens, 2007). There are also domain-
specific databases with images and descriptions such
as the art, antiques, and flowers corpora used in Boiy
et al. (2008). Wikipedia has also been used as a
source of images and associated text (Tsikrika et al.,
2011). These sources typically offer well-written
and cleanly formatted text but introduce the problem
of converting text into annotations, and the annota-
tions may not meet the requirements of the new task
(as shown in Section 3.1). Obtaining data via image
search engines is a common practice in CV (Fei-Fei
et al., 2004; Berg and Forsyth, 2006) and can also
be used to provide more challenging and diverse in-
stances of images and co-occurring text. The addi-
tional challenge for NLP is that text content on many
websites is written to improve their rank in search
engines, using techniques such as listing dozens of
popular keywords. Co-occurring text for retrieved
images on popular queries may not be representative
of the task to be performed.
3 Datasets
In this paper, we examine two established image an-
notation datasets: the BBC News Dataset of Feng
and Lapata (2008) (henceforth referred to as BBC),
and the general web dataset of Leong et al. (2010)
(henceforth referred to as UNT). These datasets
were both built to evaluate image annotation systems
that use longer co-occurring text such as a news ar-
ticle or a webpage, but they use data from differ-

tations, different preprocessing procedures, and dif-
ferent evaluation measures.
Table 1 provides an overview of the datasets;
while this section covers the source of the datsets
and their gold annotations in more detail.
3.1 BBC
The BBC Dataset (Feng and Lapata, 2008)2 contains
news articles, image captions, and images taken
from the BBC News website. Training instances
consist of a news article, image, and image caption
from the same news story. Test instances are just the
image and the article, and hold-out the caption as a
source of gold image annotations.
Using news image captions as annotations has

the disadvantage that captions often describe back-
ground information or relate the photo to the story,
rather than listing important entities in the image.
It also fails to capture variation in how humans de-
scribe images, since it is limited to one caption per
image.3 However, captions are a cheap source of
data; BBC has ten times as many images as UNT.
To address the problem of converting natural lan-
guage into annotations, a large amount of prepro-
cessing is performed. The established preprocessing
procedure for this dataset is to lemmatize and POS-
tag using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) then remove
all but the ?descriptive? words (defined as nouns, ad-
jectives, and certain classes of verbs). This leaves
a total text vocabulary of about 32K words, which

pascal-sentences) provides multiple captions per image,
but they are not naturally-occurring.
174
is further reduced by removing words that appear
fewer than five times in the training set articles. Ta-
ble 1 shows the number of word tokens and types
after performing these steps.4
3.2 UNT
The UNT Dataset (Leong et al., 2010)5 consists
of images and co-occurring text from webpages.
The webpages are found by querying Google Image
Search with frequent English words, and randomly
selecting from the results.
Each image in UNT is annotated by five people
via Mechanical Turk. In order to make human and
system results comparable, human annotators are re-
quired to only select words and collocations that are
directly extracted from the text, and the gold anno-
tations are the count of how many times each key-
word or collocation is selected. The human annota-
tors write keywords into a text box; while the col-
locations are presented as a list of candidates and
annotators mark which ones are relevant. Human
annotators tend to select subsets of collocations in
addition to the entire collocation. For example, the
gold annotation for one image has ?university of
texas?, ?university of texas at dallas?, ?the univer-
sity of texas?, and ?the university of texas at dal-
las?, each selected by at least four of the five an-
notators. Additionally, annotators can select mul-
tiple forms of the same word (such as ?tank? and
?tanks?). Gold annotations are stemmed after they
are collected, and keywords with the same stem have
their counts merged. For this reason, many key-
words have a higher count than the number of an-
notators.
4 We are unable to reproduce work from Feng & Lapata
(2008; 2010a; 2010b) and Feng (2011). Specifically, our vocab-
ulary counts after preprocessing (as in Table 1) are much higher
than reported counts, although the number of tokens per arti-
cle/caption they report is higher than ours. We have contacted
the authors, who confirmed that they took additional steps to re-
duce the size of the vocabulary, but were unable to tell us exactly
what those steps are. Therefore, all system and baseline scores
presented on their dataset are of our own implementation, and
do not match those reported in previous publications.

4 Baselines
We run several baselines on the datasets. Term fre-
quency, tf*idf, and corpus frequency are features
that are often used in annotation systems, so it is im-
portant to test them on their own. Document Title
and tf*idf are both baselines that were used in the
original papers where these datasets came from.
Sentence extraction is a new baseline that we pro-
pose specifically for the BBC dataset, in order see if
we can exploit certain properties of the gold annota-
tions, which are also derived from sentences.
4.1 Term Frequency
Term frequency has been shown to be a power-
ful feature in summarization (Nenkova and Vander-
wende, 2005). Words that appear frequently are
considered more meaningful than infrequent words.
Term frequency is the number of times a term (ex-
cluding function words) appears in a document, di-
vided by the total number of terms in that document.
On the UNT dataset we use the stopword list in-
cluded with the MALLET6 toolkit, while the BBC
dataset doesn?t matter because the function words
have already been removed.
4.2 tf*idf
While term frequency baseline requires the use of an
ad hoc function word list, tf*idf adjusts the weights
of different words depending on how important they
are in the corpus. It is a standard baseline used for
information retrieval tasks, based on the intuition
that a word that appears in a smaller number of doc-
uments is more likely to be meaningful than a word
that appears in many documents.
tf*idf is the product of term frequency and inverse
document frequency ? idf(ti) = log Nni where N is
the number of documents in the corpus, and ni is
the number of documents that contain the term ti.
For the BBC Dataset, we base the idf weights on
the document frequency of the training articles. For
UNT, we use the reported tf*idf score which uses the
British National Corpus to calculate the idf scores.7
6mallet.cs.umass.edu
7We also ran tf*idf where for each document we recalcu-
late idf using the other 299, but it didn?t make any meaningful
difference.
175
4.3 Corpus Frequency
Image annotations in both NLP and CV tend to be
distributed with a relatively small number of fre-
quently occuring keywords, and a long tail of key-
words that only appear a few times. For UNT, we
use the total keyword frequency of all the gold an-
notations, except for the one document that we are
currently scoring. For BBC, we only measure the
frequency of keywords in the training set captions,
since we are specifically interested in the frequency
of terms in captions.
4.4 Document Title
For BBC, the news article headline, and for UNT,
the title of the webpage.
4.5 Sentence Extraction
Our baseline extracts the most central sentence from
the co-occurring text and uses descriptive words
from that sentence as the image annotation. Un-
like sentence extraction techniques from Feng and
Lapata (2010a), we determine which sentence to ex-
tract using the term frequency distribution directly.
We extract the sentence with the minimum KL-
divergence to the entire document.8
5 BBC Dataset Experiments
5.1 System Comparison
In addition to the baselines, we compare against the
Mix LDA system from Feng and Lapata (2010b). In
Mix LDA, each instance is represented as a bag of
textual features (unigrams) and visual features (SIFT
features quantized to discrete ?image words? using
k-means). A Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model
is trained on articles, images, and captions from the
training set. Keywords are generated for an unseen
image and article pair by estimating the distribution
of topics that generates the test instance, then multi-
plying them with the word distributions in each topic
to find the probability of textual keywords for the
image. Text LDA is is the same model but only us-
ing words and not image features.
8One could also think of this as a version of the KLSum
summarization system (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) that
stops after one sentence.
5.2 Evaluation
The evaluation metric and the source of gold anno-
tations is described in Table 1. For the baselines 4.1,
4.2, 4.3 and the Mix LDA system, the generated an-
notation for each test image is its ten most likely
keywords. We also run all baselines and the Mix
LDA system on an unpruned version of the dataset,
where infrequent terms are not removed from train-
ing data, test data, or the gold annotations. The pur-
pose of this evaluation is to see if candidate key-
words deemd ?unlearnable? by the Mix LDA system
can be learned by the baselines.
5.3 Results
The evaluation results for the BBC Dataset are
shown in Table 2. Clearly, term frequency is a
stronger baseline than tf*idf by a large margin. The
reason for this is simple: since nearly all of BBC?s
function words are removed during preprocessing,
the only words downweighted by the idf score are
common ? but meaningful ? words such as police or
government. This is worth pointing out because, in
many cases, the choice of using a term frequency or
tf*idf baseline is made based on what was used in
previous work. As we show here and in Section 6.3,
the choice of frequency baseline should be based on
the data and processing techniques being used.
We use the corpus frequency baseline to illus-
trate the difference between standard and include-
infrequent evaluations. Since including infrequent
words doesn?t change which are most frequent in
the dataset, precision for corpus frequency doesn?t
change. But since infrequent words are now in-
cluded in the evaluation data, we see a 0.5% drop in
recall (since corpus frequency won?t capture infre-
quent words). Compared to the other baselines, this
is not a large difference. Other baselines see a larger
drop in recall because they have both more gold key-
words to estimate and more candidate keywords to
consider. tf*idf is the most affected by this, because
idf overly favors very infrequent keywords, despite
their low term frequency. In comparison, the term
frequency baseline is not as negatively affected and
even improves in precision because there are some
cases where a word is very important to an article
in the test set but just didn?t appear very often in the
training set (see Table 3 for examples). But the base-

bolded words appear fewer than five times and would be
removed from both the candidate and gold keywords in
the standard BBC evaluation.
lines with the best precision are the Doc Title and
Sentence Extraction baselines, which do not need to
generate ten keywords for every image.
While sentence extraction has a lower recall than
term frequency, it is the only baseline or system
that has improved recall when including infrequent
words. This is unexpected because our baseline se-
lects a sentence based on the term frequency of the
document, and the recall for term frequency fell.
One possible explanation is that extraction implic-
itly uses correlations between keywords. Probabili-
ties of objects appearing together in an image are not
independent; and the accuracy of annotations can be
improved by generating annotation keywords as a
set (Moran and Lavrenko, 2011). Recent works in
image captioning also use these correlations: explic-
itly, using graphical models (Kulkarni et al., 2011;
Yang et al., 2011); and implicitly, using language
models (Feng and Lapata, 2010a). In comparison,
sentence extraction is very implicit.
Unsurprisingly, the Text LDA and Mix LDA sys-
tems do worse on the include-infrequent evaluation
than they do on the standard, because words that
do not appear in the training set will not have high
probability in the trained topic models. We were un-
able to reproduce the reported scores for Mix LDA
from Feng and Lapata (2010b) where Mix LDA?s
scores were double the scores of Text LDA (see
Footnote 4). We were also unable to reproduce re-
ported scores for tf*idf and Doc Title (Feng and Lap-
ata, 2008). However, we have three reasons why we
believe our results are correct. First, BBC has more
keywords, and fewer images, than typically seen in
CV datasets. The BBC dataset is simply not suited
for learning from visual data. Second, a single SIFT
descriptor describes which way edges are oriented
at a certain point in an image (Lowe, 1999). While
certain types of edges may correlate to visual objects
also described in the text, we do not expect SIFT fea-
tures to be as informative as textual features for this
task. Third, we refer to the best system scores re-
ported by Leong et al. (2010), who evaluate their text
mining system (see section 6.1) on the standard BBC
dataset.9 While their f1 score is slightly worse than
our term frequency baseline, they do 4.86% better
than tf*idf. But, using the baselines reported in Feng
and Lapata (2008), their improvement over tf*idf is
12.06%. Next, we compare their system against fre-
quency baselines using the 10 keyword generation
task on the UNT dataset (the oot normal scores in
table 5). Their best system performs 4.45% better

than term frequency, and 0.55% worse than tf*idf.10
Although it is difficult to compare different datasets
and evaluation metrics, our baselines for BBC seem
more reasonable than the reported baselines, given
their relative performance to Leong et al?s system.
6 UNT Dataset Experiments
6.1 System Comparison
We evaluate against the text mining system from
(Leong et al., 2010). Their system generates image
keywords by extracting text from the co-occurring
text of an image. It uses three features for select-
ing keywords. Flickr Picturability queries the Flickr
API with words from the text in order to find re-
lated image tags. Retrieved tags that appear as sur-
face forms in the text are rewarded proportional to
their frequency in the text. Wikipedia Salience as-
signs scores to words based on a graph-based mea-
sure of importance that considers each term?s docu-
ment frequency in Wikipedia. Pachinko Allocation
Model is a topic model that captures correlations be-
tween topics (Li and McCallum, 2006). PAM infers
subtopics and supertopics for the text, then retrieves
top words from the top topics as annotations. There
is also a combined model of these features using an
SVM with 10-fold cross-validation.
6.2 Evaluation
Evaluation on UNT uses a framework originally de-
veloped for the SemEval lexical substitution task
(McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). This framework
accounts for disagreement between annotators by
weighting each generated keyword by the number of
human annotators who also selected that keyword.
The scoring framework consists of four evaluation
measures: best normal, best mode, oot (out-of-ten)
normal, and oot mode.11
The two best evaluations find the accuracy of a
single ?best? keyword generated by the system12.
10And as we stated earlier, the relative performance of term
frequency vs tf*idf is different from dataset to dataset.
11Both the original framework and its adaptation by Leong
et al. (2010) give precision and recall for each of the evaluation
measures. However, precision and recall are identical for all
baselines and systems, and only slightly different on the upper
bound (human) scores. To preserve space, we only present the
metric and scores for precision.
12In contrast to the original SemEval task, where systems can
Best normal measures the accuracy for each system
annotation aj as the number of times aj appears in
the Rj , the multi-set union of human tags, and aver-
ages over all the test images.

where Aj is the set of ten system annotations for

The best mode and oot mode metrics are the same
as the normal metrics except they only evaluate sys-
tem annotations for images where Rj contains a sin-
gle most frequent tag. We use the scoring software
provided by SemEval13 with the gold annotation file
provided in the UNT Dataset.
6.3 Results
The results of the lexical substitution evaluation on
the UNT Dataset are shown in Table 5. The results
from the normal show support for our earlier idea
that the relative performance of term frequency vs
tf*idf depends on the dataset. Although the term fre-
quency baseline uses a stopword list, there are other
words that appear frequently enough to suggest they
are not meaningful to the document ? such as copy-
right disclaimers.
Recall that the mode evaluation is only measured
on data instances where the gold annotations have
a single most frequent keyword. While running
the evaluation script on the gold annotation file that
came with the UNT dataset, we discover that Se-
mEval only identifies 28 of the 300 instances as hav-
ing a single mode annotation, and that for 21 of
those 28 instances, the mode keyword is ?cartoon?.
Those 21/28 images correspond to the 75% best
mode score obtained by Corpus Frequency baseline.
Given the small number of instances that actually
make from zero to many ?best? guesses, penalized by the total
number of guesses made.

evaluation is not a meaningful way to compare im-
age annotation systems on the UNT dataset.
That said, the number of cartoons in the dataset
does seem to be strikingly high. Looking at the
source of the images, we find that 45 of the 300
images were collected from a single online cartoon
library. Predictably, we find that the co-occurring
text to these images contains a long list of keywords,
and little other text that is relevant to the image. We
looked at a small sample of the rest of the dataset
and found that many of the other text documents in
UNT also have keyword lists.
Including this types of text in a general web cor-
pus is not necessarily a problem, but it?s difficult to
measure the benefits of using complex techniques
like topic modeling and graph similarily to find and
extract annotations when in so many cases the anno-
tations have already been found and extracted. This
is shown in the normal evaluation results, where the
combined system is only slightly better at selecting
the single best keyword, and no better than tf*idf for
the out-of-ten measure.
7 Conclusion
The intent of this paper is not to teach researchers
how to inflate their own results, but to encourage bet-
ter practices. With that purpose in mind, we make
the following suggestions regarding future work in
this area:

Get to know your data. The ability to quickly
and cheaply collect very large ? but very noisy ? col-
lections of data from the internet is a great advance
for both NLP and CV research. However, there still
needs to be an appopriate match betwen the task be-
ing performed, the system being proposed, and the
dataset being used; and large noisy datasets can hide
unintended features or incorrect assumptions about
the data.
Use relevant gold annotations. Do not convert
other sources of data into annotations. When collect-
ing human annotations, avoid postprocessing steps
such as merging or deleting keywords that change
the annotators? original intent. Keep an open di-
alogue with annotators about issues that they find
confusing, since that is a sign of an ill-formed task.
Preprocessing should be simple and reprodu-
cable. The use of different preprocessing proce-
dures affects the apparent performance of systems
and sometimes has unintended consequences.
Use strong baselines and compare to other work
only when appropriate. Systems developed for dif-
ferent tasks or datasets can make for misleading
comparisons if they don?t use all features available.
Strong baselines explicitly exploit low-level features
that are implicitly exploited by proposed systems, as
well as low-level features of the dataset.
Don?t remove keywords from gold annotations.
Just because keywords are impossible for one sys-
tem to learn, does not mean they are impossible for
all systems to learn. Removing evaluation data arti-
ficially inflates system scores and limits comparison
to related work.
If a proposed system is to learn associations be-
tween visual and textual features, then it is neces-
sary to use larger datasets. In general, global an-
notations, such as scenes, is easiest; identifying spe-
cific objects is more difficult; and identification of
events, activities, and other abstract qualities has a
very low success rate (Fluhr et al., 2006). Alter-
nately, use simpler image features that are known
to have a high sucess rate. For example, Deschacht
and Moens (2007) used a face detector to determine
the number of faces in an image, and then used NLP
to determine the names of those people from associ-
ated text.
