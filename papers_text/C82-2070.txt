Bilingual end multillngual terminology data banks 
(term banks) have proven an effective aid to translation. 
The translation problem which has been most resistant 
tO term bank ass i s tance~ however, i s  that  of  ident i fy ing  
prec i se ly  those t rans la t ions  which are appropr ia te  fo r  a 
g iven  term in  a SL text .  This i s  compounded by the re la ted  
problems of SL homonymy and polysemy and TL synonymy. The 
greates t  cha l lenge  at the text  leve l  i s  dynamica l ly  spec i fy -  
ing  the lex icon  used in  the sub l~age of  a document. The 
so lu t ion  to th i s  problem depends somewhat on whether te rmino-  
logy  i s  he ld  in  one la rge  bank, whic h promotes shar ing  and 
comprehens iveness ,  or in  many smal le r  banks, wh iohencoura  - 
ges independence and spec ia l i za t ion .  
The pr inc ip le  approach to the t rans la t ion  ident i f i ca t -  
i on  problem hereto fore  has cons is ted  in  f i l te r ing  out i r -  
re levant  t rans la t ions  on the bas i s  of such accompanying do- 
cumentat ion as sub jec t  f ie ld ,  source ind icat ion ,  or  grammat- 
i ca l  code. Some organ izat ions  have developed in i t ia l  capab i -  
l i t i es  fo r  poo l ing  or  th read ing  in  order  to  dea l  wi th  the 
sublanguage problem. ~ re fers  to the c reat ion  of  in ter -  
na l ly  cohes ive  sub inventor ies  of a data  base.  Threadin~ 
refers to the ability to specify (and access) a logical file 
made up of a sequence of pools, in wb_ic~ the logical keys 
are associated with physical records on a flrst-hit basis.

Pools may be organ ized  on any funct iona l  p r inc ip le .  They 
may re f lec t  the admAnis t rat ing  body - from standards  or~anAzat-  
ion  through oompan~ d iv i s?on  to ind iv idua l  t rans la tor .  Or they 
may re f lec t  a domain of  app l i ca t ion  - from techn ica l  f i e ld  
through company product  l ine  to chapter  in  operat ions  manual.  
3oms pools  are  c reated  to over r ide  o ther  more genera l  poo ls ,  
such as SL or  TL d ia lec t  pools  which preempt standard. . langus~e 
poo ls .

f i r s t  sequenced pool  in  which a term appears!  mu l t ip le  access ,  
which makes data  ava i lab le  from any of  the sequenced pools  in  
whiOh a term appears!  and composite access ,  a spec ia l  case of  
mu l t ip le  access  which const ruc ts  a data  complex from the fu l l
