Abstract 
A growing body of research analyzes the linguistic and discourse properties of communication in 
online social media. Most of the analysis, especially at the discourse level, is done manually by 
human researchers. This talk explores how the findings and techniques of computer-mediated dis-
course analysis (CMDA), a paradigm I have been developing and teaching for 18 years, can in-
form computational approaches to communication in social media. I start by reviewing 
established automation approaches, which mainly focus on structural linguistic phenomena, and 
emergent approaches, such as machine learning models that identify semantically- and pragmati-
cally-richer phenomena, through the lens of CMDA, pointing out the strengths and limitations of 
each. The basic problem is that patterns in the discourse of social media users can be identified by 
humans that do not appear to lend themselves to reliable automated identification using existing 
approaches. To begin to address this problem, I draw on examples of recent work on Twitter, 
Wikipedia, and web-based discussion forums to suggest an approach that synthesizes linguistical-
ly-informed manual analysis and existing automated techniques. I consider how such an approach 
could scale up, while still making use of human analysts, and I identify a number of real-world 
problems that automated CMDA could help address.
