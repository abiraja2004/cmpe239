Abstract 
We describe the architecture of the ILEX system, ? which supports opportunistic text generation. In 
? web-based text generation, the SYstem cannot plan the entire multi-page discourse because the user's 
browsing path is unpredictable. For this reason, ? the system must be ready opportunistically to take 
? advantage ofwhatever path the user chooses. We describe both the nature of opportunism in ILEX's 
museum domain, and then show how ILEX has been designed to function in this environment. The 
architecture presented addresses opportunism in both content determination a d sentenceplanning. 
1 Exp lo i t ing  oppor tun i t ies  in text  generat ion  ? 
Many models of text generation make use of standard patterns (whether expressed as schemas (e.g. 
\[McKeown 85\]) or plan operators (e.g. \[Moore and Paris 93\])) to break down communicative goals 
in such a way as to produce xtended texts. Such models are making two basic assumptions: 
1. Text generation is goal directed, in the sense that spans and subspans of text are designed to 
achieve unitary communicative goals \[Grosz and Sidner 86\]. 
2. Although the details Of the structUre of a text may have to be tuned to particulars of the 
communicative situation, generally the structure is determined by the goals and their decom- 
position. That is, a generator ?needs strategies for decomposing the achievement of complex ? 
goals into sequences ofutterances, rather than ways of combining sequences of utterances into 
more complex structures. Generation is "top-down", rather than"bottom-up" \[Marcu 97\]. 
Our belief is that there is an important class of NLG problems for which these basic assumptions? 
are not helpful. These problems all involve situations where semi-fixed explanation strategies are 
less useful than the ability to exploit opportunities. WordNet gives the following definition of 
0pportunity': 
Oppor tun i ty :  "A possibility due to a favorable combination of circumstances" 
Because ? opportunities involve ?combinations of circumstances, they are often unexpected and hard 
to predict. It may be too expensive or impossible to have complete knowledge about them. Top- 
down generation strategies may not be able ?to exploit opportunities (except at the cost of looking 
for all opportunities at all? points) because it is difficult to associate classes of opportunities with 
fixed stages in the explanation ?process. 
We are investigating opportunistic text generation i the Intelligent Labelling Explorer (ILEX) 
project, which seeks automatically togenerate a sequence of commentaries for items in an electronic

catalogue (or museum gallery) in such a way as to reflect he interest of the user and also to further 
certain educational (O r other)aims. The current domain of the system is the 20th Century Jewellery 
Exhibit in the Royal Museum of Scotland but ILEX is? designed to work with any domain where 
object descriptions are required. In ILEX, the system has an agenda of communicative., goals to 
achieve, which reflect the goals of the curators. The user has the freedom to look at any object in 
the gallery at any time. The system produces a description of each object asked for by the user, 
such that each description contributes as best it can to the system's goals and the sequenc e of 
descriptions fits together into a coherent whole. The result is a variety of mixed-initiative dialogue, 
in which the user is in control of the high-level communicative goal (what gets described) but the 
system is in control of how the goal is realised (how the chosen object is described). 
In such a dynamically unfolding environment, it is not possible to predict all possible paths 
through the interaction. The system must thus be ready to exploit opportunities in order to 
achieve its goals. In ILEX, the user's arbitrary choice represents a horizon beyond which is it not 
practical to predict. Each generated page may be the lastone to be generated and therefore has to 
be planned to achieve as much as possible on its own. Moreover, almost any part of the generated 
text  can be optimised to exploit the arbitrary Situation that the user has got themself into. 
2 Opportunities: evidence and models 
2.1 Ev idence:  the  goals  of  a museum curator  
A museum curator seeks to achieve general educational goals through the description of a set 
of carefully selected objects. In general, the goals are to  convey important generalisations (e.g. 
"Organic jewellery tends to have natural themes") and to dispel important misconceptions (e.g. 
"Jewellery tends to be made of expensive materials").? These important points have to be brought 
in appropriately during the description of the exhibits which are selected by the visitor. 
? In order to see how a human being tackles such complex goals, we performed a "CuratOr of 
Oz" experiment, ? in which we chose an arbitrary sequence of exhibits:in the 20th Century Jewellery 
gallery of the National Museum of Scotland and asked the curator to give Us a commentary. The 
curator intro~luced general  po in ts / themes  suggested by the Objects, moving from the objects 
to the general issues surrounding them, using the objects merely as an excuse to introduce these 
topics, for instance as in the following ("V" indicates the visitor and "C" the curator): 
V: "There's a set of three objects here?' 
C: "What these symbolise for me are the preoccupations of the 1980's with .... " 
She re inforced points f rom the past,  exploiting an excuse to come back to an important point 
that  has already been made and show its relevance in a new situation: _~ 
V: 
C: 
She also 
"This one here..." 
"Yes, you've made a link with the first piece that we looked at, which is the idea of 
a jewel which is also a work of art and a sculpture..." 
made l inks  to previous i tems, thereby improving the continuity of the discourse: 
C: "...  and it was work like this which directly inspired work like the Roger Morris 
brooch on the stand which we looked at earlier." 
: 29 
All of these can be regarded as ways of exploiting opportunities offered by the situation. 
There is nothing like a conventional schema structure to the descriptions produced. The ap- 
proach looks a lot more like putt ingtogether a bitrary pieces of interesting material subject to 
only very loose retrictions. This may not be the best way to produce a carefully-argued'written 
text, and clearly the result is not always fluent according to stringent criteria. In some but not 
all--respects, it resembles the Unplanned iscourses discussed by \[Ochs 79\]. Furthermore, in the 
interactive and?relatively informal setting of a museum tour, it works. 
We thus decided that ILEX should have a whole set of goals about things tosay. These are 
linked into a single metalevel goal, which is something like "to achieve as many of the individual 
? goals as possible, within the space available, in the context of a globally coherent discourse which 
maintains the reader's interest". 
2 .2  Mode ls :  p lann ing  for  oppor tun i t ies  ? 
We discussed above why t0p-down planning seems an unnatural basis for formulating an NLG model 
that can exploit opportunities. In contrast, ILEX is inspired loosely by ideas from opportunistic 
planning \[Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 79, Pryor 96\]. Key elements of this are: 
? Interleaving Of planning and execution. 
? Expanding "sketchy plans" as needed, taking into account he current state of the world. 
? Flexible choice of tasks from an agenda. 
? Recognition of opportunities through detection of reference f atures, followed by more thor- 
ough analysis. 
PrYor's Work is ?implemented in PARETO, a planner for a simulated robot delivery vehicle: The  
vehicle is given orders to deliver various objects to various building sites, and needs to locate these 
objects at other sites. The system is opportunistic n that while the truck is working on one goal, it 
i s  always read Y to switch to another if an ?object on its find-and-deliver list turns up. For example, 
i f  thet ruck  stops a t  one place to pick up a hammer, it may notice a saw, which is also on its list, 
? and thus pick it up and proceed to  its delivery point. 
Pryor's planning occurs within a limited horizon--the robot only has certain knowledge in 
regards to the immediate location, and outside of that, the world is uncertain (objects are sometimes 
randomly moved between sites in the world). ILEX inhabits a world analogous in certain respects 
to PARETO's: .each?page is a site on the map, and i t is  up to us to find opportunities for realising 
our goals at each site. However, while in the truck world the system is in control of motion to 
the next site, in the museum, it is the user who chooses the next page. Conversely, while objects 
outside the truck's immediate vicinity may move autonomously, for ILEX, facts and their values 
do not change. 
Opportunist icplanning has similarities with a number of other approaches to planning. It 
? shares with incremental p anning (used in NLG by \[Cawsey 92\]) the idea of starting to execute 
a plan before the plan is complete, andbeing prepared to repair the partial plan in the light of 
feedback. It shares with reactive planning the idea of being directed as much by the characteristics 
of the state of the world at execution time as by the pursuit of preconceived goals. However, unlike 
pure reactive planning it does acknowledge the need for explicit plans to be manipulated and it

differs from many models of incremental planning in the extent to which the original p lan can be 
diverted to exploit the characteristics of the world at execution time. 
3 The  ILEX arch i tec ture  ? 
To show how ILEX supports opportunistic ? text generation, we will here outline the parts of the 
system and the operation of its text planning. Basically the ILEX task agenda at each point 
consists of the facts that the system knows which have not yet been conveyed to the user. Each 
of these 'tasks' has an opportunity value (its educational value, assumed interest o the reader and 
contribution to coherence). At each point of the discourse, we 'perform tasks' (include facts) which 
provide the highest opportunity gain. 
3.1 The  Content  Potent ia l  
The facts of our knowledge base are interconnected in various ways, and to facilitate content 
selection and structuring, we organise the facts into a content potential - a graph of facts inter- 
connected in terms of thematic and rhetorical relations. The content potential is an intermed.iary 
stage between the knowledge base and text, motivated in a similar way to DRSs \[Kamp 81\] by the 
desire explicitly to represent the selection of possible knowledge structures that can be reflected 
linguistically. ;As Figure 1 shows, the content potential forms a three-tiered structure of entities, ? 
facts and relations. There are links between items in adjoining tiers, but no links within a tier or 
between entities and relations. We now discuss the three tiers in turn. 
3.1.1 Ent i t ies  
Entities are the participants in facts (things and qualities in terms of Penman's  Upper Model). 
Entities may be of two kinds: specific entities - such as an individual jewel or person; and gen- 
er/c entities - an entity representing some class of entities, such as Scottish jewellers, or art-deco 
brooches. Generic entities are treated essentially in the same way as specific entities in the content 
potential, for purposes uch as the tracking of focus, anaphor generation, and so on. 
3.1 .2  Facts  
Facts represent the relations between entities, in both events (e.g., X made Y), and states (e.g., 
X owns Y) .  In ILEX, we have assumed that all facts are binary (simple relations between two 
entities), e.g., made-by(J -9999, K?ng01) represents he  fact that the designer King made item

RELATIONS 
Figure 2: The Concession Relation 
J-9999. The binary assumption simplifies our architecture, allowing quicker text generation. At 
a later stage, we may allow more complex fact-representation. Complex sentences can be formed 
through aggregating together these binary facts. Each fact has the following fields: 2 
Pred : The name of the Predicate connecting the two entities. 
Argl : The entity in the relationship which the fact is primarily about. For instance, "J-999 was 
designed by ?Jessie King" is primarily about J-999, not about King. 
Arg2 : The other entity in the relat ionship.  This is sometimes another thing (such as "Jessie 
King") and Sometimes a quality. 
Various other fields exist which detail the polarity, defeasibility, interest, importance and assimil- 
ation Of the ?fact. Facts representing general principles or negations of general misconceptions are 
expressed using generi c entities and can be included in a text just like any other facts. ?
3.1.3 Re la t ions  ? 
? Relation nodes represent relations between facts. Although based on conceptual relations, they 
qualify as rhetorical in that only the Subset of relations that could explicitly be conveyed is in- 
Cluded in the content potential. Relations include Example, Concession, Amplification, Similarity, 
Contrast, "In that", "In other words", Specification, Whereas and While. Each relation has a nuc- 
leus and  satellite (as in RST) as well usa  set of precondition facts, which must be assimilated 
before the relation can be. There are no relations between relation-nodes in the content Potential 
at present. Relation-nodes only link fact-nodes. 
Relations in the content potential present a uniform interface as nodes connected to facts in the 
graph but we do not have a uniform theory of all the relations. Figure 2 shows a small subgraph 
of the content-potential , showing two Concession relations between facts. 
Most of the content potential is precompiled, though relevant negations and comparisons depend 
on the set of entities already encountered and have to be computed on demand, causing the addition 
of various consequent facts and relations. 
2Another type of fact node is used to contain canned text. The canned text is usually associated with the focal 
object of the text, and no Arg2 field is provided.

Figure 3: An Entity-Based Move 
3.2 Content  Determinat ion  
ILEX plans a single page of text, describing a single entity, at a time. The  content potential 
represents he information we can express, and the interconnectivity of information. When we 
receive the resquest for an entity description, the planner sets that entity as the global focus of the 
current page. Opportunistic planning then commences: The facts directly Connected to that entity 
represent opportunities: the system can coherently include these facts in the text. ?If any of these 
facts are actually selected, then new opportunities are created in two ways: 
Ent i ty -based moves:  From the fact, we go to the argument which we didn't enter the fact 
from. We then select anew fact reachable from this node. See Figure 3. If we followed the 
Arg2 role of a fact, then we are in a sense selecting a new focus (local focus). The facts we 
generate about this entity should have the new entity as the ? focus. Thus in the example, 
King becomes the Theme of the second sentence. Sentences introduced using entity-based 
moves can be realised using an Elaboration relation to the starting fact. 
An entity:based move from an individual entity to its generic lass ?entity can be made once 
the appropriate "isa" fact has been selected: 
This item is an organic jewel. 
Organic jewels tend to be ...  
? Relat ion-based moves: from the initial fact, we follow a relation-node to some new fact. 
The new fact will be realised textually as a satellite to the original fact's nucleus. The type 
Of the relation-node will determine the rhetorical relation of the link. See Figure 4. 
Once we select a new fact in either of the ways described above, the new fact may act as the 
? starting point for new opportunistic expansion. Alternatively, we may decide to backtrack to some 
earlier point, effecting a focus pop in Grosz and Sidner's \[Grosz and Sidner 86\] terms. 
The selection of which opportunity to explore is determined by a ?number of heuristic factors. 
Firstly, facts are weighted according to the chain of relations back to the focus of the page 
\[O'Donnell 97\]. This is a way of preventing lengthly digressions from the supposed topic of the 
text. Secondly, each fact is associated with numbers which represent the opportunity 'value' of the 
fact. The opportunities are of two kinds: 
Interest .  the estimated value of the fact to the user, e.g. being made of plastic or paper are more 
interesting (to the user), because they are unusual in jewellery. Canned anecdotes about a 
piece of jewellerY may also have high interest values.

Impor tance .  ? the value of the fact as regards the system's educational genda, e.g., the  system 
? considers it important  o  educate on stylistic development, so facts about styles are rated 
?highly. 
These values are moderated by a third fact annotation: 
Ass imi lat ion.  the degree to which the fact is assumed known to the user, either from general 
knowledge, or through prior mentions in the web interaction (these values change dynamic- 
ally). 
The three values interest, importance and (1 - assimilation) are multiplied together to calculate 
the local score of each fact. The overall opportunity value of a fact is the product of the local score 
of the fact, the overall opportunity value of the parent (the node through which it was reached) 
and a weight for the relation between them. It is the overall opportunity values that axe used 
to select which textual opportunities to follow. We have no special theory about where interest 
and importance come from, though the above examples suggest that there may be domain- and 
user-type-specific rules that can be used to derive some of them. 
In Summary, content-determination in ILEX is seen as the task of optimising the selection 
of opportunities that are offered by the topic of the text, subject to not moving too far from 
that topic. The result of content-determination is a connected subgraph of the content potential 
(Figure 5). The use of interest and importance in ILEX is analogous to theuse of "salience" in 
\[McDonald and Conklin 82\]. Because the process is seen as a graph traversal problem, there are 
als0 similarities with work on generating text from semantic networks \[Simmons and Slocum 72, 
Sibun 92\]. In a sense, our work aims to combine the best of both. 
3.3 Text  P lann ing  
Although the process of content determination has worked through a number of moves that may be 
made in the generated text, the result is not the kind of tree structure that one needs for realisation 
and also has been influenced only by local considerations of coherence. Text planning therefore 
requires the following two steps: 
I. Extend the subgraph to a complete subgraph that includes all the relations linking the selected 
fact nodes.

2. Produce from this an "optimal" selection of relations, so as to give rise to an RST? tree 
? including all the selected facts~ 
The idea of combining a set of facts together into an "optimal" text is compatible with \[Hovy 90\] 
and the earlier work of \[Mann and Moore 81\]. Again this involves exploiting opportunities. For in- 
?stance, in order to avoid an awkward focus shift at some point, one might attempt to include a selec- 
ted fact about a new entity immediately after another one that mentions the same entity. Other text 
? planning operations that are opportunistic in nature include aggregation \[Dalianis and Hovy 96\] 
and redundancy suppression \[McDonald 92\], though we will not consider these here. 
The second step described above is exactly that described by \[Marcu 97\]. That is, one is given 
a set of facts all of which should be included in a text and a set of relations between facts, some 
of which can be included in the text. The task is to produce a legal RS tree using the facts and 
some relations (or the "best" such tree). Marcu's approach first of all attempts to find the best 
ordering 0f the facts. For every relation that could be indicated, constraints are generated saying 
what the order of the two facts involved should be and that the facts should be adjacent. The 
Constraints are weighted accord!ng to attributes of rhetorical relations that have been determined 
empirically. A standard constraint satisfaction algorithm is used to find the linear sequence such 
that the total weight of the satisfied constraints i maximal. Once the sequence of facts is known, 
a general algo~thm is used to construct all possible RS trees based on those facts. 
We could use Marcu's methods directly, but are exploring more widely because we would like 
to take into account a wider range of preference criteria, develop algorithms that treat entity-based 
elaborations rather differently from other rhetorical relations \[Oberlander t al 98\] and investigate 
heuristic approaches that wilt scale up better. We are currently experimenting with ?three different 
algorithms for building an RST tree. These are all opportunistic in nature, rather than being 
strongly goal-directed or schema-based: 
1. The RS tree (realised depth-first) is built to directly reflect the tree of nodes explored 
(breadth=first) in the content potential. 
2. The best trees up to a fixed depth using relational moves are constructed; these are "glued ''? 
together using entity based moves \[Oberlander t al 98\]. 
3. A genetic algorithm is used to search for a legal tree that is of as high quality as possible 
\[Mellish et al98\]. 
The current version of ILEX, which is being prepared for evaluation, uses the second of these 
algorithms and generates context-dependent descriptions for 32 different items of modern jewellery

in that it is a remarkably fluid piece. Indeed Organic style jewels usually draw on natural themes 
for inspiration; for instance this jewel is inspired by forms found in natural wood, in that it has a 
bracelet with a twig-like appearance. It resembles the Arts and Crafts style necklace, in that like 
the ?necklace it is made from silver metal. However this jewel differs? from the necklace, in that it

3 .4 I LEX  and  Oppor tun is t i c  P lann ing  
Wi thth is  description of ILEX in mind, we can explore the analogy with PARETO in more detail. 
Where PARETO embarks on the execution of a sketchy plan ?to start moving around the truck 
? world, ILEX embarks on a graph traversal, starting out from the topic entity and guided by the 
desire not to digress excessively~ Thecontent  potential offers options to ILEX in a similar way to  
PARETO's world. In PARETO, reference features indicate possible opportunities; in ILEX this 
role is played by the interest and importance annotations. Deeper analysis is require d by PARETO 
before seizing an opportunity; this is ?probably analogous to the way that ILEX attempts to find 
th e globally best way o f  incoporating material into the RST tree. 
4 Conclusions 
:An opportuni/~tic planning ? algorithm seems to be required for the ILEX domain (and some other 
domains tOO). ILEX certainly does have goals - to educate the user and keep them interested. 
But these are essentially compiled away into the content of the content potential (e.g. the entities 
and general facts that are included) and the interest and importance annotations on facts. At  
runtime, ILEX just has the task of selecting the best opportunities, given the situation that the 
user has reached. These opportunities arise not just in how content is selected but also in how it 
is structured. We conclude that' there a strong analogy between the way that ILEX operates and 
the ?techniques used in opportunistic ?approaches to planning in other domains, and this connection ? 
i s  worthy of further exploration.
