Abstract
We describe the CoNLL-2003 shared task:
language-independent named entity recog-
nition. We give background information on
the data sets (English and German) and
the evaluation method, present a general
overview of the systems that have taken
part in the task and discuss their perfor-
mance.
1 Introduction
Named entities are phrases that contain the names
of persons, organizations and locations. Example:
[ORG U.N. ] official [PER Ekeus ] heads for
[LOC Baghdad ] .
This sentence contains three named entities: Ekeus
is a person, U.N. is a organization and Baghdad is
a location. Named entity recognition is an impor-
tant task of information extraction systems. There
has been a lot of work on named entity recognition,
especially for English (see Borthwick (1999) for an
overview). The Message Understanding Conferences
(MUC) have offered developers the opportunity to
evaluate systems for English on the same data in a
competition. They have also produced a scheme for
entity annotation (Chinchor et al, 1999). More re-
cently, there have been other system development
competitions which dealt with different languages
(IREX and CoNLL-2002).
The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns
language-independent named entity recognition. We
will concentrate on four types of named entities:
persons, locations, organizations and names of
miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the pre-
vious three groups. The shared task of CoNLL-2002
dealt with named entity recognition for Spanish and
Dutch (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). The participants
of the 2003 shared task have been offered training
and test data for two other European languages:
English and German. They have used the data
for developing a named-entity recognition system
that includes a machine learning component. The
shared task organizers were especially interested in
approaches that made use of resources other than
the supplied training data, for example gazetteers
and unannotated data.
2 Data and Evaluation
In this section we discuss the sources of the data
that were used in this shared task, the preprocessing
steps we have performed on the data, the format of
the data and the method that was used for evaluating
the participating systems.
2.1 Data
The CoNLL-2003 named entity data consists of eight
files covering two languages: English and German1.
For each of the languages there is a training file, a de-
velopment file, a test file and a large file with unanno-
tated data. The learning methods were trained with
the training data. The development data could be
used for tuning the parameters of the learning meth-
ods. The challenge of this year?s shared task was
to incorporate the unannotated data in the learning
process in one way or another. When the best pa-
rameters were found, the method could be trained on
the training data and tested on the test data. The
results of the different learning methods on the test
sets are compared in the evaluation of the shared
task. The split between development data and test
data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the
test data.
The English data was taken from the Reuters Cor-
pus2. This corpus consists of Reuters news stories

between August 1996 and August 1997. For the
training and development set, ten days? worth of data
were taken from the files representing the end of Au-
gust 1996. For the test set, the texts were from De-
cember 1996. The preprocessed raw data covers the
month of September 1996.
The text for the German data was taken from the
ECI Multilingual Text Corpus3. This corpus consists
of texts in many languages. The portion of data that
was used for this task, was extracted from the Ger-
man newspaper Frankfurter Rundshau. All three of
the training, development and test sets were taken
from articles written in one week at the end of Au-
gust 1992. The raw data were taken from the months
of September to December 1992.
Table 1 contains an overview of the sizes of the
data files. The unannotated data contain 17 million
tokens (English) and 14 million tokens (German).
2.2 Data preprocessing
The participants were given access to the corpus af-
ter some linguistic preprocessing had been done: for
all data, a tokenizer, part-of-speech tagger, and a
chunker were applied to the raw data. We created
two basic language-specific tokenizers for this shared
task. The English data was tagged and chunked by
the memory-based MBT tagger (Daelemans et al,
2002). The German data was lemmatized, tagged
and chunked by the decision tree tagger Treetagger
(Schmid, 1995).
Named entity tagging of English and German
training, development, and test data, was done by
hand at the University of Antwerp. Mostly, MUC
conventions were followed (Chinchor et al, 1999).
An extra named entity category called MISC was
added to denote all names which are not already in
the other categories. This includes adjectives, like
Italian, and events, like 1000 Lakes Rally, making it
a very diverse category.

2.3 Data format
All data files contain one word per line with empty
lines representing sentence boundaries. At the end
of each line there is a tag which states whether the
current word is inside a named entity or not. The
tag also encodes the type of named entity. Here is
an example sentence:
U.N. NNP I-NP I-ORG
official NN I-NP O
Ekeus NNP I-NP I-PER
heads VBZ I-VP O
for IN I-PP O
Baghdad NNP I-NP I-LOC
. . O O
Each line contains four fields: the word, its part-
of-speech tag, its chunk tag and its named entity
tag. Words tagged with O are outside of named en-
tities and the I-XXX tag is used for words inside a
named entity of type XXX. Whenever two entities of
type XXX are immediately next to each other, the
first word of the second entity will be tagged B-XXX
in order to show that it starts another entity. The
data contains entities of four types: persons (PER),
organizations (ORG), locations (LOC) and miscel-
laneous names (MISC). This tagging scheme is the
IOB scheme originally put forward by Ramshaw and
Marcus (1995). We assume that named entities are
non-recursive and non-overlapping. When a named
entity is embedded in another named entity, usually
only the top level entity has been annotated.
Table 2 contains an overview of the number of
named entities in each data file.

with ?=1 (Van Rijsbergen, 1975). Precision is the
percentage of named entities found by the learning
system that are correct. Recall is the percentage of
named entities present in the corpus that are found
by the system. A named entity is correct only if it
is an exact match of the corresponding entity in the
data file.
3 Participating Systems
Sixteen systems have participated in the CoNLL-
2003 shared task. They employed a wide variety of
machine learning techniques as well as system com-
bination. Most of the participants have attempted
to use information other than the available train-
ing data. This information included gazetteers and
unannotated data, and there was one participant
who used the output of externally trained named en-
tity recognition systems.
3.1 Learning techniques
The most frequently applied technique in the
CoNLL-2003 shared task is the Maximum Entropy
Model. Five systems used this statistical learning
method. Three systems used Maximum Entropy
Models in isolation (Bender et al, 2003; Chieu and
Ng, 2003; Curran and Clark, 2003). Two more
systems used them in combination with other tech-
niques (Florian et al, 2003; Klein et al, 2003). Max-
imum Entropy Models seem to be a good choice for
this kind of task: the top three results for English
and the top two results for German were obtained
by participants who employed them in one way or
another.
Hidden Markov Models were employed by four of
the systems that took part in the shared task (Flo-
rian et al, 2003; Klein et al, 2003; Mayfield et al,
2003; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003). However, they
were always used in combination with other learning
techniques. Klein et al (2003) also applied the re-
lated Conditional Markov Models for combining clas-
sifiers.
Learning methods that were based on connection-
ist approaches were applied by four systems. Zhang
and Johnson (2003) used robust risk minimization,
which is a Winnow technique. Florian et al (2003)
employed the same technique in a combination of
learners. Voted perceptrons were applied to the
shared task data by Carreras et al (2003a) and
Hammerton used a recurrent neural network (Long
Short-Term Memory) for finding named entities.
Other learning approaches were employed less fre-
quently. Two teams used AdaBoost.MH (Carreras
et al, 2003b; Wu et al, 2003) and two other groups
employed memory-based learning (De Meulder and
Daelemans, 2003; Hendrickx and Van den Bosch,
2003). Transformation-based learning (Florian et
al., 2003), Support Vector Machines (Mayfield et al,
2003) and Conditional Random Fields (McCallum
and Li, 2003) were applied by one system each.
Combination of different learning systems has
proven to be a good method for obtaining excellent
results. Five participating groups have applied sys-
tem combination. Florian et al (2003) tested dif-
ferent methods for combining the results of four sys-
tems and found that robust risk minimization worked
best. Klein et al (2003) employed a stacked learn-
ing system which contains Hidden Markov Models,
Maximum Entropy Models and Conditional Markov
Models. Mayfield et al (2003) stacked two learners
and obtained better performance. Wu et al (2003)
applied both stacking and voting to three learners.
Munro et al (2003) employed both voting and bag-
ging for combining classifiers.
3.2 Features
The choice of the learning approach is important for
obtaining a good system for recognizing named en-
tities. However, in the CoNLL-2002 shared task we
found out that choice of features is at least as impor-
tant. An overview of some of the types of features
chosen by the shared task participants, can be found
in Table 3.
All participants used lexical features (words) ex-
cept for Whitelaw and Patrick (2003) who imple-
mented a character-based method. Most of the sys-
tems employed part-of-speech tags and two of them
have recomputed the English tags with better tag-
gers (Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003; Wu et al,
2003). Othographic information, affixes, gazetteers
and chunk information were also incorporated in
most systems although one group reports that the
available chunking information did not help (Wu et
al., 2003) Other features were used less frequently.
Table 3 does not reveal a single feature that would
be ideal for named entity recognition.
3.3 External resources
Eleven of the sixteen participating teams have at-
tempted to use information other than the training
data that was supplied for this shared task. All in-
cluded gazetteers in their systems. Four groups ex-
amined the usability of unannotated data, either for
extracting training instances (Bender et al, 2003;
Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003) or obtaining
extra named entities for gazetteers (De Meulder and
Daelemans, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003). A rea-
sonable number of groups have also employed unan-
notated data for obtaining capitalization features for
words. One participating team has used externally
trained named entity recognition systems for English
as a part in a combined system (Florian et al, 2003).

with extra information compared to while using only
the available training data. The inclusion of ex-
tra named entity recognition systems seems to have
worked well (Florian et al, 2003). Generally the sys-
tems that only used gazetteers seem to gain more
than systems that have used unannotated data for
other purposes than obtaining capitalization infor-
mation. However, the gain differences between the
two approaches are most obvious for English for
which better gazetteers are available. With the ex-
ception of the result of Zhang and Johnson (2003),
there is not much difference in the German results
between the gains obtained by using gazetteers and
those obtained by using unannotated data.
3.4 Performances
A baseline rate was computed for the English and the
German test sets. It was produced by a system which
only identified entities which had a unique class in
the training data. If a phrase was part of more than
one entity, the system would select the longest one.
All systems that participated in the shared task have
outperformed the baseline system.
For all the F?=1 rates we have estimated sig-
nificance boundaries by using bootstrap resampling
(Noreen, 1989). From each output file of a system,
250 random samples of sentences have been chosen
and the distribution of the F?=1 rates in these sam-
ples is assumed to be the distribution of the perfor-
mance of the system. We assume that performance
A is significantly different from performance B if A
is not within the center 90% of the distribution of B.
The performances of the sixteen systems on the
two test data sets can be found in Table 5. For En-
glish, the combined classifier of Florian et al (2003)
achieved the highest overall F?=1 rate. However,
the difference between their performance and that
of the Maximum Entropy approach of Chieu and Ng
(2003) is not significant. An important feature of the
best system that other participants did not use, was
the inclusion of the output of two externally trained
named entity recognizers in the combination process.
Florian et al (2003) have also obtained the highest
F?=1 rate for the German data. Here there is no sig-
nificant difference between them and the systems of
Klein et al (2003) and Zhang and Johnson (2003).
We have combined the results of the sixteen sys-
tem in order to see if there was room for improve-
ment. We converted the output of the systems to
the same IOB tagging representation and searched
for the set of systems from which the best tags for
the development data could be obtained with ma-
jority voting. The optimal set of systems was de-
termined by performing a bidirectional hill-climbing
search (Caruana and Freitag, 1994) with beam size 9,
starting from zero features. A majority vote of five
systems (Chieu and Ng, 2003; Florian et al, 2003;
Klein et al, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Whitelaw
and Patrick, 2003) performed best on the English
development data. Another combination of five sys-
tems (Carreras et al, 2003b; Mayfield et al, 2003;
McCallum and Li, 2003; Munro et al, 2003; Zhang
and Johnson, 2003) obtained the best result for the
German development data. We have performed a
majority vote with these sets of systems on the re-
lated test sets and obtained F?=1 rates of 90.30 for
English (14% error reduction compared with the best
system) and 74.17 for German (6% error reduction).
4 Concluding Remarks
We have described the CoNLL-2003 shared task:
language-independent named entity recognition.
Sixteen systems have processed English and German
named entity data. The best performance for both
languages has been obtained by a combined learn-
ing system that used Maximum Entropy Models,
transformation-based learning, Hidden Markov Mod-
els as well as robust risk minimization (Florian et al,
2003). Apart from the training data, this system also
employed gazetteers and the output of two externally
trained named entity recognizers. The performance
of the system of Chieu et al (2003) was not signif-
icantly different from the best performance for En-
glish and the method of Klein et al (2003) and the
approach of Zhang and Johnson (2003) were not sig-
nificantly worse than the best result for German.
Eleven teams have incorporated information other
than the training data in their system. Four of them
have obtained error reductions of 15% or more for
English and one has managed this for German. The
resources used by these systems, gazetteers and ex-
ternally trained named entity systems, still require a
lot of manual work. Systems that employed unanno-
tated data, obtained performance gains around 5%.
The search for an excellent method for taking advan-
tage of the fast amount of available raw text, remains
open.
