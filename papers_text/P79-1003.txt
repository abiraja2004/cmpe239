This paper describes an approach to conceptual analysis and understanding of natural language in which 
linguistic knowledge centers on individual words, and the analysis mechanisms consist of interactions 
among distributed procedural experts representing that knowledge. Each word expert models the process 
of diagnosing the intended usage of a particular word in context. The Word Expert Parser performs 
conceptual analysis through the Interactlons of tl~e individual experts, which ask questions and 
exchange information in converging on a single mutually acceptable sentence meaning. The Word Expert 
theory is advanced as a better cognitive model of natural language understanding than the traditional 
rule-based approaches. The Word Expert Parser models parts o~ tSe theory, and the important issues of 
control and representation that arise in developing such a model \[orm the basis of the technical 
discussion. An example from the prototype LISP implementation helps explain the theoretical results 
presented. 
\[. Introduction 
Computational understanding of natural language 
requires complex Interactions among a variety of distinct 
yet redundant mechanisms. The construction of a computer 
program to perform such a task begins with the 
development of  an organ izat iona l  framework which 
Inherent ly  . incorporates  cer ta in  assumptions about the 
nature ot these processes and the environment in which 
they take place. Such cogn i t ive  premises a f fec t  
nro?oundly the scope and substance of  computational  
~nalys is  fo r  comprehension as found in  the program. 
This paper descr ibes a theory of  conceptual parsing 
which considers knowledge about language to be 
d is t r ibuted  across a co l lec t ion  of procedural  experts  
centered on ind iv idua l  words. Natural  language parsing 
with word experts  enta i l s  several  new hypotheses about 
the organ izat ion  and representat ion  o f  l ingu is t i c  and 
pragmat ic  knowledge for computational language 
comprenension.  The Word Expert Parser  \[1\] demonstrates  
hpw the word expert qTt~T~ed w?~h cer ta in  ocher 
choices oaseo on previous work, affect structure and 
process  in a cogn i t ive  model of pars ing .  
The Word Expert Parser is  a cognitive model of 
conceptual language ana lys i s  in  which the un i t  o f  
l tngu~st ic  knowledge is  the word and the fqcu~ o~ 
research ts the set or processes unoerlyinR 
comprehension. The model is aimed directly at problem~ 
of word sense ambiguity and idiomatic expressions, and in 
greatly generalizing the notion of wora sense, promotes 
these issues to a central place in the study of language 
parsing. Parsing models typically cope unsatisfactorily 
with the wide heterogeneity of usages of particular 
words. If a sentence contains a standard form of a word, 
it can usually be parsed; if it involves a less prevalent 
form which has a different par t  of speech,  perhaps it too 
can be parsed. Disti.nguishing amen 8 the ~any senses of a 
common vero ,  ad jec t ive ,  or pronoun, ta r  example, or 
correctly translating idioms are rarely poss ib le ,  
At the source of this difficulty is the reliance on 
rule-based formalisms, whethar syntactic or semantic 
(e.g.. cases), which attempt to capture ~he l inguist ic  
contributions inherent in constituent chunks or sentences 
that consist of more than single words. A crucial 
assumption underlying work on the Word Expert Parser is 
that the ~undamental unit of linguistic Knowledge is the 
word. and that understanding its sense or role in a 
par t i cu la r  context  is  the cent ra l  pars ing  process .  In 
the parser  to be descr ibed ,  the word exper t  const i tu tes  
the kernel of l i ngu is t i c  knowled~nd zts representat ion  
the e~emental data s t ructure .  IE is  procedural in  nature 
and executes d i rec t ly  as a process, cooperat ing with the 
other  experts  fo r  a given sentence to a r r ive  at  a 
mutual ly  acceptable sentence meaning. 
Certaln principles behind the parser d 9 nqt follow 
directly from the view or worn primacy, out ~rom other 
recent theor ies  of pars ing .  The cogn i t ive  processes

The "throw" expert runs next and success fu l ly  prunes

of global control state Knowledge, and waits rot "pit" to 
terminate ? "PIt"' s expert now runs, and since thls 
10 
bulletin board contains "deep"'s expectations of a 
~ .  o I~,  or printed matter, "pit" maps immediately 
onto a large hole in the ground. This in turn, causes 
both the resumption and termination of the "deep" expert 
as well as the closure of the concept bin to whlch the~ 
oelong. At the closing of the concept bin, the "into 
exper t  resumes, marks its concept as a location, and 
terminates. With all the word experts completed and all 
concept bins  closed, the expert fo r  ".'" runs and 
completes the parse. The concept level workspace now 
contains five concepts: a picture concept designating an 
intellectual philosopher, an event concept representing 
the throwing action, another picture concept describing a 
fruit pit which came from a peach,  a setting concept 
representing a location, and the picture concept which 
describes precisely the nature of this location. Work on 
the mechanism to determine the schematic roles of the 
concepts has just begun, and is described briefl~ later. 
A program trace that shows the actions ot the Nora Expert 
Parser on the example just presented is available on 
request. 
3. Structure of the Model 
The organization of the parser centers around data 
repositories on two levels -- the sentence level 
workspace contains a word bin for each word (and 
sub-lexical morpheme) of the input and the concept level 
workspace contains a concept bin (described above) for 
each concept referred to in the input sentence. A third 
level of processing, the schema level workspaee, while 
not yet implemented, will contain a schema for each 
conceptual action of the input sentence. All actions 
affecting the contents  of these data bins are  car r ied  out 
by the word expert processes, one of which is associated 
with each word bin in the wo rkspace.  In addition to this 
first order information about lexical and conceptual 
objects, the parser contains a central tableau of control 
s ta te  descriptions available to any expert that  can make 
use of self referential knowledge about its own 
processing or the states of processing of other model 
components. The availability of such control state 
information improves considerably both the performance 
and the psychological appeal of the model -- each word 
expert attempting to disambiguate its contextual usage 
knows precise ly  t~e progress of its neighbors and the 
state of convergence (or the lack thereof) of the entire 
pars ing  process .  
Word Experts  
The pr inc ipa l  knowledge s t ruc ture  of the model i s  
the word sense d i sc r iminat ion  exper t .  A word exper t  
represents  the the l ingu is t i c  knowledge requ i red  to 
d l samblguate  the meaning of a s ing le  word in  any context .  
Although represented  cumputat ions l ly  as corout lnes ,  these 
exper ts  d i f fe r  cons iderab ly  from ad hoc LISP programs and 
have approx imate ly  the same ~e la t lon  ~o LISP as an 
augmented transition network \ [15\]  grammar. ? 2use as rh~ 
graphic represeptatlon of an augmented transltlon networ~ 
aemonstrates the basic control paradigm of the ATN 
parsing approach, a graphic representation for word 
experts exists which embodies its functional framework. 
Each word expert derives from a branching discrimination 
structure called a word sense discrimination network or 
sense net. A sense nec consists of an ordered se~ of 
? /~tr~Ti~g (the nodes of the network), and for each one, 
the set of possible answers to that question (the 
branches emanating from each node).  T raversa l  of a sense 
network represents the process of converging on a single 
contextual usage of a word. The terminal nodes of a 
sense net represent d is t inc t  word senses of the word 
modeled by the network. A sense net for the word "heavy" 
appears in part (a) of Figure 2. Examination of this 
network reveals that four senses are represented -- the 
three adjective usages shown in Figure 1 plus the numinal 
sense of "thug" as In "Joe's heavy told me to beat it." 
Expert Representation 
The network representat ion  of a word exper t  leaves  
out certain computational necessities of actually using 
it for parsing. A word expert has two fundamental 
activities. (I) An expert asks questions about the 
lexical and conceptual data being amassed by its 
neighbors, the control states of various model 
components, and more general issues requiring common 
sense or knowledge of the physical world. (2) In 
addition, at  each node an expert performs act ions  to 
affect the lexical and conceptual contents of the 
workspaces,  the control states of itself, concept bins, 
6An ATN without arbitrarily complex LISP computations 
on each arc  and at  each node, that  i s .  
7In addition to common sense knowledge of the physical 
world,  this could include information about the plot, 
characters, or focus of a children's story ,  or in a 
spec ia l i zed  domain such as medical diagnosis \ [17\ ] ,  could 
i nc lude  highly domain spec i f i c  knowledge. 
and the parser as a whole, and the model's expectations. 
The current procedural representation of the word expert 
for "heavy" appears as part (b) of Figure 2. 
Each word expert process Includes three 
components -- a declarative header, a start node, and a 
body. The header provides a description of the expert's 
behavior for purposes of inter-expert constraint 
forwarding. If sense discrimination by a word expert 
results in the knowledge that a word to its right, either 
not yet executed or suspended, must map to a specific 
sense or conceptual category, then it should constrain it 
to do so, thus helping it avoid unnecessary processing or 
fallacious reasoning. Since word experts are represented 
as processes, constraining an expert consists of altering 
the pointer to the address at which it expects to 
continue execution. Through its descriptive header, an 
expert conditions this activity and insures that it takes 
place without disastrous consequences. 
Each node in the body of the expert has a type 
deslgnated by a letter following the node name. either Q 
(question), A (action), S (suspend), or T (terminal). By 
tracing through the question nodes (treating the others 
as vacuous except for their gore pointers), a sense 
network for each word expert process can be derived. The 
graphical framework of a word expert (and thus the 
questions it asks) represents its principal linguistic 
task of word sense disamblguatlon. Each question node 
has  a type, shown following the Q in the.node -- MC 
tmultiple choice), C (conditional), YN (yes/no/, and PI 
(posslble/Imposslble). In the example  expert for 
"heavy", node nl represents a conditional query into the 
state of the entire parsing process, and n?de n\[2 a 
multiple choice question involving the conceptual nature 
of the word to "heavy"s  right in the input sentence. 
b Multiple choice questions typically delve into the 
aslc relations among ob3ects ann actions zn the world. 
For example, the question asked at node n12 of the 
"heavy" expert is typical: 
"Is the object to my right better described as 
an artistic object a a form of precipitation, or 
a phys ica l  object? 
Action nodes in the "heavy" expert perform such tasks as 
determining the concept bin to which it contributes, and 
pqstin 8 expectations for the word to its right. In terms 
ot its side effects, the "heavy" expert is fairly simple. 
A full account of the word expert representation language 
will be available next year \[12\].

Four types  of quest ions  may be asked by an exper t ,  
and whereas some queries can be made in more than one 
way, the several question types solicit different kinds 
of information. Some questions requlre fairly involved 
inference to be answered adequately, and others demand no 
more than simple register lookup. This variety 
corresponds well, in my opinion, with human processing 
involved in conceptual analysis. Certain contextual 
clues to meaning are structural; taking advantage of them 
requ i res  so le l~  knowledge of the s ta te  of the pars ing  
process (e .g . ,  'bu i ld ing  a noun prase" ) .  Other c lues  
subt ly  p resent  themselves  through more g loba l  ev idence ,  
usua l ly  having to do with l ink ing  together  h igh order  
in fo rmat ion  about the spec i f i c  domain at  hand. In s to ry  
comprehension, th i s  involves the plot, characters, focus 
of attention, and general social psychology as well as 
common sense knowledge about the world. Understanding 
texts uealing with specialized subject matter requires 
knowledge about that par t i cu la r  sub jec t ,  other subjects 
related to it, and of course, common sense. The 
quest ions  asked by a word exper t  in  a r r iv ing  at  the 
cor rec t  contextua l  in terpreta t ion  of a word probe sources 
of both kinds of information, and take different forms.

could either be one that already exists in the workspace 
or a new one created by the expert at the time of its 
decision. After deciding on a concept, the principal 
role of a (content) word expert is to discriminate among 
the possibly many remaining senses of the word. Note 
that a good deal of this disambiguation may take place 
during the initial phase of concept determination. After 
asking enough questions to discover some piece of 
conceptual data, this data augments what already exists 
in  the word's concept 5 in ,  inc lud ing dec la ra t ive  
s t ruc tures  put there both by itself and by the other 
lexical participants in that concept. The parse 
completes when each word expert in the .workspace nas 
terminated. At this point, the concept ievez worKspace 
contains a complete conceptual interpretation ot the 
input text. 
Conceptual Case Resolution 
Adequate conceptual parsing of input text regulres a 
stage missing from this dlscusslon and constituting the 
current phase of research --- the attachment of each 
picture and setting concept (bin) to the appropriate 
conceptual case of an event concept. Such a mechanism 
can be viewed in an entirely analogous fashion to the 
mechanisms just described for performln 8 local 
disamblguation of word senses. Rather ~han word experts, 
however, the experts on this level are conceptual in 
nature. The concept level thus becomes the main level of 
activity and a new level, call it the schema level 
workspace, turns into the ma~n repository rot inferred 
In format ion .  When a concept bin has c losed,  a concept 
expert is retrieved from a disk file, and initialized. 
If it is an event concept, its function is to fill its 
conceptual cases with settings and pictures; if it is a 
setting or picture, it must aetermlne its schematic role. 
The activity on this level, therefore, involves higher 
order processing than sense discrimination, but occurs in 
Just about the same way. The ambiguities involved in 
mapping known concepts in to  conceptual case schemata 
appear ident ica l  to those having to do with ma2ping words 
in to  concepts. Discovering that the word "p i t  maps in  a 
cer ta in  context  to the not ion  of  a " f ru i t  p i t "  requires 
the same ab i l i t i es  and knowledge as rea l i z ing  that  "the 
red house" maps in some context  to the not ion  of  "a 
~ocation for smoking pot and listening to records". The 
implementation of the mechanisms to carry out this next 
level of inferential disambiguation has already begun. 
It should be quite clear that this schematic level is by  
no means the end of the line -- active expert-baseo p~ot 
following and general text understanding flt nicely Int? 
the word expert framework and constitute its loglca~ 
extension. 
4. Summary and Conclusions 
The Word Expert Parser is a theory of o rganization 
and cgntro ~ for a conceptual, lansuage an@.~yzer. Th~ 
contro~ envlrosment s cnaracter~zeo ny a co?~ectlon ot 
generator - l i ke  corout ines ,  ca l led  word experts, which 
cooperat ive ly  a r r ive  at  a conceptual in terpretat ion  of  an 
~nput sentence. Many torms of  l ingu is t i c  ann 
non-lln~uistlc knowledge are  available to these experts 
In performing the i r  task ,  including control s ta te  
Knowledge and knowledge of the world, and by eliminating 
a l l  but the mpst pers i s tent  forms o f  ambiguity,  the 
parser models numan processing.  
This new model of  parsin? claims a number o f  
theoret i ca l  advantages: (I) I t s  representations of 
linguistic knowledge reflect the enormous redundancy in 
natura l  languages - -  without th i s  redundancy in  the 
model, the in ter -exper t  handshaking (seen in  many..forms 
in  the example parse) would not be poss ib le .  ~z) ~ne 
model suggests some in teres t ing  approaches to language 
acquisition. Since much of a word expert's knowledge Is 
encoded in a branching discrimination structure,, addlng 
new information about a word involves the addition oz a 
new branch. This branch would be placed in the expert at 
the point where the contextual clues for dlsambiguatlng 
the new usage differ from those present for a known 
usage .  (3) Idiosyncratic uses of langua8@ are easily 
e ncooea, s~nce the wore expert provides a c~esr way to no 
so. These uses are indistinguishable from other uses in 
their encodings in the model. (4) The parser represents 
a cognltively plausible model or se~uentlal 
coroutine-like processing in human ~anguage 
understanding. The organization of linguistic knowledge 
around the word, rather than the rewrite rule, motivates 
interesting conjectures about the flow of control In a 
human language understander.
