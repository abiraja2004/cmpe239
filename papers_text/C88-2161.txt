Abstract 
This approach has been developed in the context of the 
EUROTRA machine translation (MT) project and thus has been 
des igned  w i th  respect  to a syntax  based s t ra t i f i ca t iona l  
translation process? We assume that in a semantic representation 
determiners are deleted and that their semantic function which 
is represented by semantic features is percolated into the 
mothernode.  The semant ic  funct ions  of determiners  are 
explicated. The interaction between grammatical and lexical 
quantif ieatiun is outlined. Ensemble theory is applied to the 
"count" /"mass"  noun d is t inc t ion .  T rans fer  of quantif ication 
between German, English, and French is i l lustrated with respect 
to the "count"/"mass" distinction. The article closes with an 
outlook on \[he relevance of generalized quantifiers for Machine 
Translation. 
1. Semantic representation of determiners in EUROTRA 
EUROTRA aims at defining a semantic representation which 
guarantees simple transfer between all European languages, that 
is, it should be "euroversal". The concept of "euroversality" 
implies, amongst others, a semantic representation i  a canonical 
form out or" which all European languages may be generated. 
With respect o this canonical form it is reasonable to delete the 
determiners during translation into the semantic representation 
and to represent heir meaning by semantic features of the NP. 
This step may be motivated primarily by two facts: 
(1) Languages vary with respect to the use of 0- 
determiners. 
(2) The set properties realized by an entity are 
expressed ifferently in different languages. 
Tim idea that determiners are not deep structure constituents, 
but that their surface structure constituents have to be generated 
from a semantic representation is not new. It can already be 
found for example in PERLMUTTER 1970. Moreover, to 
represent he quantif ier by means of semantic features of the 
NP implies that the entity which is focussed by the process of 
determination cannot be referred to directly, but only as the 
argument of the determiner which provides a new referent (cf. 
P INKAL  1986). BARWISE & COOPER (1981) cons ider  
determiners as two-place predicates which take the noun which 
is the domain of quantif ication as one argument, and the rest of 
the sentence, which is the predicate quantified as the other 
argument. With respect to the EUROTRA MT system this has 
important implications for the translation between the syntactic 
dependency level - the EUROTRA Relational Structure (ERS) 
and the semant ic  level  - the in ter face  St ructure  (IS). 
Determiners which have the function of modifying nouns at 
ERS on the basis of several syntactic conditions establish 
dif ferent types of determination. Those types of determination 
are the ba,;is for deduc ing  (i.e. t rans la t ing)  exact ly  that 
information which yields the new referent in the NP by 
unifying with the semantic features of the noun. 
Although both determiners and quantifiers have characteristic 
functions, they have others in common, so that a borderline is 
diff icult to draw. Cases of crossclassification exist in many 
languages, as for example the one constituted by German 
der/ein/O, French le/un/O, English the/a/O (cf. VATER 
1963). This is why we describe both determiners and quantifiers 
by a common set of semantic features. 
2. The semantic functions 
It is agreed in the literature that determiners and quantifiers 
share the function of DELIMITATION (cf. VATER 1980). This 
delimitation consists in the localisation of a referent in the 
speech or textual context or the non-l inguistic situation or in 
relation to the presupposed knowledge of the hearer or reader 
(only the first of these functions, and this again in a rather 
restricted way, may be represented in the EUROTRA system). 
BARWISE & COOPER (1981) refer  to this funct ion  of 
de l imi ta t ion  as the proper ty  " l ives on" and def ine  that 
determiners "assign to common count noun denotations (i.e. sets) 
A a quantif ier that lives on A." (BARWISE & COOPER 
1981.179) 
2.1. Quantif ication over whole sets: "generic" versus 
"identifying" 
It is the function of determiners and quantifiers to quantify over 
gets of entities. The writer's motivation to create sets is that the 
entities which should be members of the set share one or several 
propert ies .  Fo l lowing the t rad i t ion  of the MONTAGUE 
approach, BARWISE & COOPER treat all NPs as quantifiers 
which denote sets of properties of individuals. There are two 
basic types of WHOLE SETS, which may be created. 
(l) The entity's extens ion  is created "generically" by means 
of it's inherent lexical meaning as in the following 
example: 
Die Linguisten sind in formalen Sprachen geiibt 
(Linguists are practised in formal languages.). 
(2) 
Here the NP quantifies exactly over the complete set of 
linguists of the actual world. 
An lntensional property of the entity set makes possible 
it's "identification". In this case a WItOLE SET is 
referred to which is precisely delimited (cf. VATI?;R 
1963, PLATTEAU 1980). This type of entity set may 
only be established context-sensitive. It is thus a set 
which may be referred to as a WHOLE SET only with 
respect to a certain domain of interpretation, which is 
the intensional property: 
The linguists of EUROTRA ... 
This NP quantif ies exactly over that set of linguists who 
work for EUROTRA, 
2.2. The semantic functions of determiners: determiners as 
variables and as variable-binding fnnctions 
It is the function of determiners to select one or several entities 
from a set of entit ies (cf. PLATTEAU 1980). 
The salient function of indefinite determiners is equivalent o 
that of the existential quantif ier (cf. LANGENDONCK 1980, 
PLATTEAU 1980); they introduce new entities into the speech 
or text situation. Thus they only express that entities exist in the 
speech situation, without "specifying" which. It is an infinite set 
of a potent ia l  of ent i t ies  (cf. HAWKINS 1978.198). We may 
therefore say that indefinite determiners in their salient function 
are variables. This yields a PARTIAL SET of entities which is 
"existential". 
Beside this salient function the indefinite determiner may also 
"specify" entities, if it is clear in the universe of discourse which 
entity is designated (ef. OOMEN 1977 and DI EUGENIO 1986). 
791 
The salient function of definite determiners i that the existence 
of an. entity is already presupposed by the writer, i.e. the writer 
presupposes that the entity is already given, that the reader is 
already acquainted with it (cf. OOMEN 1977). Now the variable 
which is presupposed to have been assigned to the entity 
(entities) by the indefinite determiner is bound: 
We need another linguist for EUROTRA-D. The linguist 
should be a specialist in s.vntax. 
The definite article thus yields a WHOLE SET of entities which 
is precisely l imited by a fixed reference point, that is it is 
"identified". 
2.3. Classifiers 
A special case of indefiniteness may be said to be what 
LANGENDONCK calls "indefiniteness with asserted partition" 
in opposition to "ordinary asserted partition". We said above that 
it is the function of determination to select an entity or entities 
out of a set. We can also say that they partition a set into those 
entities which are members of a subset and those which are not. 
With "ordinary asserted partition" expressed by an indefinite 
determiner and a noun this partitioned set is an infinite set of a 
potential of individuals. "Indefinites with asserted partition" are 
classifier constructions. They constitute the clearest instance of 
exc lus iveness  or par t i t ion ing ,  in par t i cu la r  par t i t i ve  
constructions with the semantic structure 
\[3x 1(xl_c x~)\]. 
(cf. LANGENDONCK 1980.213). Exactly the same holds for 
this structure that holds for the relation between definite and 
indef in i te  determinat ion :  A potent ia l  subset of ent i t ies  is 
presupposed, when a specific part of those is asserted: 
this part of the article ... 
Beside the feature "partitive" the features "sortal", "collective", 
"mensurar', "scale", and "nnmerative" become relevant in the 
realization of this structure. 
3. Determination of the set properties 
The fact that the set to be quantif ied is greater than one is 
expressed by different surface structures in the European 
languages.  With proper  "count ''z nouns p lu ra l i ty  may be 
designated by the plural morpheme (the determiners). With 
"discontinuous" "mass" nouns classifiers may be used in order to 
partition the mass into amounts and thus make the partioned 
masses (not the mass on its own!) countable (several pieces of 
advice, different boxes of vegetables). Finally, a "collective" 
refers to a set which is greater than one (the furn i ture) .  In 
German the individuation of certain "abstract" mass" entities 
may simply be achieved by the plural morpheme. The use of the 
German plural is only impossible with nouns which designate 
"continuous" "masses". 
3.1. The interaction of lexical and grammatical quantification 
A noun designates an entity the inherent setforming properties 
of  wh ich  are  lex ica l i zed .  By means  of  g rammat ica l  
quantif ication this entity may form different sets. On the one 
hand there are entities, the inherent setforming properties of 
which may not be influenced grammatically, but which may 
only designate on their own. This is the case with "continuous" 
"mass" nouns; we may also say that they des ignate  sets 
absolutely. On the other hand there are entities which are not 
able to form sets on their own. This holds for "discontinuous" 
"mass" entities; they may also be considered as designating sets 
by a variable with respect o their lexical potential, this variable 
only being fil led by a constant by grammatical context. From a 
logical point of view this idea' is developed more precisely and 
moreover integrated into a coherent system in BUNT 1979 and 
1985. In the following we will apply this system to language. 
"Continuous" ensembles (of. BUNT) are true "masses" which may 
not be enumerated that is they may not be designated by a 
plural expression. They satisfy QUINES cumulat ive reference 
792 
condit ion,  or more precisely, the distr ibutive reference 
condition. The cumulative reference of mass nouns implies that 
the union of any two masses W is again W. Or vice versa the 
distr ibutive reference condition means that any part of some 
mass W must again be W. If we refer to "continuous" ensembles, 
we do not imagine any smallest part of the ensemble which may 
not be divided any more without the ensemble ceasing to be 
what it was. A prototypical "continuous" ensemble is that 
referred to by the "mass" noun time. The following syntactic 
condition holds: 
(1) All nonpluralizable "mass" nouns are "continuous". 
This means that the property of continuity is lexical. Examples 
of nouns re fer r ing  to "cont inuous  . . . .  mass" ent i t ies  are 
participation, impetus, increase, adhesion, intportanee, xtent. 
Contrary to the mode of reference to "continuous" masses is that 
to "d iscont inuous"  ensembles  or sets. While the feature  
"discontinuous" is lexical, its subspecifications are only realized 
in interaction with grammatical structure: 
"Atomic" sets or ensembles cannot be imagined to have any 
genuine (=nonempty) parts, that is 
(2) All "count" and "discontinuous" "mass" entities 
designated by singular nouns are "atomic". 
"Atomic" sets or ensembles may, however, be merged into 
"discrete" sets or ensembles which are constituted either by 
"individual" count" entities or by entities which are basically 
"mass", but which may be turned into an ensemble which we 
conceive of as having genuine parts e.g by being represented by 
several amounts. This is expressed by pluralization or by 
preceding classifiers, as e.g. with advice, which gets enumerable 
by the "numerative" piece. This is not possible with "continuous" 
mass entities, as e.g. those designated by the nouns importance, 
research. 
Moreover, "collectives" are "discrete". Now we can summarize: 
(3) The des ignat ion  of "d iscreteness"  is y ie lded by 
pluralized "count" and "mass" nouns as well as by 
"collective" nouns (cf. ALLAN 1976.99, where he defines 
the result of collectivizing as the unmarked (singular) 
form of plural reference). 
4. Transfer of quantified nounphrases 
We start from our condition developed in the previous chapter 
that p lu ra l i zab i l i ty  is represented  by the lex ica l  features  
"discontinuous" and "continuous". Singular NPs then have to be 
translated into three semantically different NPs at IS: 
(1) Into an "atomic" NP if and only if a "count" or "mass" 
noun for which "complexity" does not equal "collective", 
and for which "distribution" equals "discontinuous". 
(2) Into a "continuous" NP if and only if a "continuous" 
"mass" noun is generated. 
(3) Into a "discrete" NP then and only then, if a "collective" 
noun is generated. 
The source IS - representat ion  of an atomic  NP wi l l  be 
transferred into the identical target IS-representation with the 
exclusion of the features "mass" and "count". which may change 
as in the translation from le conseil in it's "individual" reading to 
English the advice, as illustrated in figure 2.

Fig. 1 Transfer from le eonseil to the advice 
In this case a singular NP will be generated in the English 
synthesis. 
A "continuous" NP may change into a "discontinuous" "atomic" 
or "discrete" NP, as in the translation from der Rat into the 
advice, as represented in figure 2.

Fig. 2 Transfer from der Rat to the advice 
Again a singular NP will be generated in English synthesis. 
NPs referring to "discrete" mass" entities may either change 
into a "discrete" NP constituted of "individual" entities, as in the 
translation from the furniture to die MiJbelstiJcke or they may be 
transferred into the same target-language representation by 
translating into die MiJbel. The translations are represented in 
figure 3. 14oth representations will effect the generation of a 
plural NP in German synthesis.

During analysis plural NPs are dealt with very simply: they are 
all translated into discrete NPs at IS. In the same way as with 
singular Ni's, the set properties may change in transfer as in the 
translation from plural les conseils in its collective as well as in 
its individual reading to singular der Rat as represented in

The feature "continuous" blocks pluralization. In the case of 
numera l  quant i f i ca t ion  the  German noun must  be 
D ISCONTINUOUS;  in this ease un i f i ca t ion  succeeds  with 
Ratschlag, which is "count'r, "individual", "discontinuous", that is 
"atomic" in the case of  a one-element set and "discrete" in the 
ease of a set that has more than one element. Whereas the latter 
case is the unmarked case in which the default rule (4.1) applies, 
the former case is the marked one which is represented in f igure

In transfer les conseils which is lexicaUy "count" in one reading, 
"mass" in the other and "discontinuous" in both readings, the 
latter feature being grammatically specified as "discrete" goes to 
the advice, which has the lex ica l  features  "mass" and 
"discontinuous" the latter feature being subspecified as "discrete" 
by our default rule (see above rule (4.1) c!mpter 4.1.), 
(1) because it is enumerable by means of the numerative piece 
(2) because we may refer to a single representative of the entity 
' in  its "atomic" meaning and to a set of representations in its 
"discrete" meaning. 4 This translation is represented in fig. 5.

Now rule (4.3) should guarantee for English generation that 
"atomic" and "d iscrete . . . .  masses" are t rans la ted  into a 
nonp lura l i zed  noun in Eng l i sh  i f  the Eng l i sh  noun is

Rule (4.2) guarantees that "discrete" or "atomic" "masses" which 
are preceded by a quantifier, are translated into a noun which is 
syntactically governed by the numerative piece, which then in 
turn will be the bearer of the respective singular or plural 
morpheme which  is deduced from the semant ic  features 
"atomic"/"discrete".

A sentence-based interpretation will yield the advice in analysis 
,as ambiguous between the "atomic" and the "discrete" reading 
(the "discrete" reading again between the "identifying" and the 
793  
"generic" reading) and with some exceptions we must accept it as 
the correct result of a sentence based analysis to get two 
translational results in French as in this case: le conseil and les 
conseils. 
The unmarked transfer is achieved by our default rule (4.1). The 
marked case is that the lexical value of the target language 
disagrees with the source language one, so that for the latter 
case we have rules (4.4) and (4.5).

Moreover by the given transfer rules translations between the 
following representations will be guaranteed: 
(1) Les meubles which is lexical ly either "count" and. 
"individual", and hence "discontinuous", or "mass" and 
"collective", that is, it is also "discontinuous" in this 
second reading. On the basis of their morphosyntactic 
behaviour both readings yield a "discrete" NP 
(2) The translation from French into English yields two 
identical translations, as only one lexical unit with the 
"collective" reading exists in English: the furniture which 
is lexically "mass", "collective", and hence yields a 
"discrete" NP, so that in the case of being quantified the 
quantifier is again followed by piece. One of the 
identical readings has to be killed. 
(3) If we translate from French into German, the NP with 
the "individual" noun is translated into die MObelsti~cke, 
which has the same features, both in the NP and in the 
n. The French NP with the "collective" n is translated 
into die MObel, which also has the same features, both 
for NP and n. In the case of a preceding cardinal 
number phrase the German noun MObelstiick with a 
morpheme as "numerative" must be generated. The 
German noun in this case is "count", "individual", 
"discontinuous", that is "atomic" in the case of a one- 
element set and "discrete" in the case of a set which has 
? more than one element. 
4.1. Conclusion 
It was the intention of this chapter to point out how two types 
of semantic features with lexical and grammatical origin which 
quantify the nounphrase interact in transfer: 
From the dictionaries we generate those semantic features 
quantifying the set of entities which refer to the constitution of 
the ent i ty  ( "count" / "mass" ,  " ind iv idua l " / "co l tec t ive" /  
"partitive"/"sortal", "eontinuous"/"discontinuous"), while in the 
unmarked ease the setforming properties are transferred from 
source to target language representation by a default rule 
("discrete"/"atomie"). More precisely, an "atomic" set alay s goes 
to an "atomic" set, a "discrete" set normally goes to a "discrete" 
set, it may, however, go to a "continuous" set, if a continuous 
entity is generated from the dictionary as in the case of the 
correspondence b tween les conseils and der Rat/the advice. In 
the same way a "continuous" set normally goes to a "continuous" 
set, it may, however, go to a "discontinuous" et as in the 
opposite translation from der Rat to the advice. 
5. Generalized quantlflers in Machine Translation s
Let us close with an evaluation of the super/subset relationship 
holding for generalized quantifiers and its relevance for machine 
translation. Indeed, we are convinced, that the properties of 
persistency, monotonieity, strength and weakness, conservativity 
and others which BARWISE & COOPER (1981) and others have 
introduced are relevant with respect to the disambigation of 
794 
determiner readings and thus have to be part of the semantic 
representation f the NP. BARWISE & COOPER themselves 
mention the ambiguity of a few, which is monotonously 
increasing (men 1) in its positive reading (at least a few) and 
not monotonous in its negative reading (only a few): 
mon /": 1/ (at least) a few linguists implement, then a 
few linguists work. 
mon~,: *'If (only) a few linguists work, then (only) a few 
linguists implement. 
mon f: *If (only) a few linguists implement, hen only 
a few linguists work. 
The fact that negation reverses monotonicity is realized with 
mass nouns and pluralized count nouns which in their positive 
reading appear with zero-article. In the positive reading which 
is men t the partitive article is used in French: 
I f  there is wine that contains 12% alcohol, then there is 
wine that contains alcohol. 
I f  there are wine bottles that contain 12% alcohol, then 
there are wine bottles that contain alcohol. 
S'il y a du vin qui contient 12 % d'alcool, il y a du vin qui 
contient de l'alcool. 
S'il y a des bouteilles de vin qui contiennent 12% d'alcool, 
il y a des bouteilles de vin qui contiennent de/'alcool. 
In the negative reading which is monl simple de instead of the 
partitive article is used in French: 
I f  there is no wine that contains alcohol, then there is no 
wine that contains 12% alcool. 
I f  there are no bottles of wine that contain alcohol, then 
there are no bottles of wine that contain 12% alcool. 
S'il n'y apas de vin qui contient d'alcool, il n'y apas de 
vin qui contient 12% de l'alcool. 
S'il n'a pas de bouteilles de vin qui contiennent d'alcool, il 
. n'y a pas de bouteilles de vin qui contiennent de l'alcool. 
6. The organization of the semantic features of determination 
As an overview let us give a graphical representation of the 
organization of the features. In this representation the ENTITY- 
node is the axiom and each node is subspecified either by a 
disjunction of features, which we represent by the solidlined 
edges, or by a conjunction of features which we indicate by the 
"+" marked edges.

7. Summary 
We have illustrated several semantic representations which are 
meant to guarantee the correct generation of different surface 
structures of quantifiers. The intricate interwovenness between 
lexical and grammatical quantification has been outlined. In 
some cases as for example in the case of "collective" and 
"discrete" or "individual" and "atomic" "discontinuity" the 
ambiguity could not be resolved.

4, Advice is enumerable by the "numerative" piece in contrast o 
other "abstract" English "mass" nouns like patience, faith, dignity, 
behaviour, research. We hypothesize that the "numerative" piece 
in English has a similar function as the plural morpheme has in 
German with nouns designating "abstract" mass" entities which 
are "discontinuous" which means that several exemplars of an 
atomic entity may be merged into a discrete nsemble (cf. LObel 
1986).
