Abstract
Textual records of business-oriented conver-
sations between customers and agents need
to be analyzed properly to acquire useful
business insights that improve productivity.
For such an analysis, it is critical to iden-
tify appropriate textual segments and ex-
pressions to focus on, especially when the
textual data consists of complete transcripts,
which are often lengthy and redundant. In
this paper, we propose a method to iden-
tify important segments from the conversa-
tions by looking for changes in the accuracy
of a categorizer designed to separate differ-
ent business outcomes. We extract effective
expressions from the important segments to
define various viewpoints. In text mining a
viewpoint defines the important associations
between key entities and it is crucial that the
correct viewpoints are identified. We show
the effectiveness of the method by using real
datasets from a car rental service center.
1 Introduction
?Contact center? is a general term for customer ser-
vice centers, help desks, and information phone
lines. Many companies operate contact centers to
sell their products, handle customer issues, and ad-
dress product-related and services-related issues. In
contact centers, analysts try to get insights for im-
proving business processes from stored customer
contact data. Gigabytes of customer contact records
are produced every day in the form of audio record-
ings of speech, transcripts, call summaries, email,
etc. Though analysis by experts results in insights
that are very deep and useful, such analysis usually
covers only a very small (1-2%) fraction of the total
call volume and yet requires significant workload.
The demands for extracting trends and knowledge
from the whole text data collection by using text
mining technology, therefore, are increasing rapidly.
In order to acquire valuable knowledge through
text mining, it is generally critical to identify im-
portant expressions to be monitored and compared
within the textual data. For example, given a large
collection of contact records at the contact center
of a manufacturer, the analysis of expressions for
products and expressions for problems often leads to
business value by identifying specific problems in a
specific product. If 30% of the contact records with
expressions for a specific product such as ?ABC?
contain expressions about a specific trouble such
as ?cracked?, while the expressions about the same
trouble appear in only 5% of the contact records for
similar products, then it should be a clue that the
product ?ABC? may actually have a crack-related
problem. An effective way to facilitate this type
of analysis is to register important expressions in a
lexicon such as ?ABC? and ?cracked? as associated
respectively with their categories such as ?product?
and ?problem? so that the behavior of terms in the
same category can be compared easily. It is actu-
ally one of the most important steps of text mining
to identify such relevant expressions and their cate-
gories that can potentially lead to some valuable in-
sights. A failure in this step often leads to a failure
in the text mining. Also, it has been considered an
artistic task that requires highly experienced consul-
458
tants to define such categories, which are often de-
scribed as the viewpoint for doing the analysis, and
their corresponding expressions through trial and er-
ror.
In this paper, we propose a method to identify im-
portant segments of textual data for analysis from
full transcripts of conversations. Compared to the
written summary of a conversation, a transcription
of an entire conversation tends to be quite lengthy
and contains various forms of redundancy. Many
of the terms appearing in the conversation are not
relevant for specific analysis. For example, the
terms for greeting such as ?Hello? and ?Welcome
to (Company A)? are unlikely to be associated with
specific business results such as purchased-or-not
and satisfied-or-not, especially because the conver-
sation is transcribed without preserving the nonver-
bal moods such as tone of voice, emotion etc. Thus
it is crucial to identify key segments and notable
expressions within conversations for analysis to ac-
quire valuable insights.
We exploit the fact that business conversations
follow set patterns such as an opening followed by a
request and the confirmation of details followed by
a closing, etc. By taking advantage of this feature of
business conversations, we have developed a method
to identify key segments and the notable expressions
within conversations that tend to discriminate be-
tween the business results. Such key segments, the
trigger segments, and the notable expressions asso-
ciated with certain business results lead us to easily
understand appropriate viewpoints for analysis.
Application of our method for analyzing nearly
one thousand conversations from a rental car reser-
vation office enabled us to acquire novel insights for
improving agent productivity and resulted in an ac-
tual increase in revenues.
Organization of the Paper: We start by describ-
ing the properties of the conversation data used in
this paper. Section 3 describes the method for iden-
tifying useful viewpoints and expressions that meet
the specified purpose. Section 4 provides the results
using conversational data. After the discussion in
Section 5, we conclude the paper in Section 6.
2 Business-Oriented Conversation Data
We consider business-oriented conversation data
collected at contact centers handling inbound tele-
phone sales and reservations. Such business oriented
conversations have the following properties.
? Each conversation is a one-to-one interaction
between a customer and an agent.
? For many contact center processes the conver-
sation flow is well defined in advance.
? There are a fixed number of outcomes and each
conversation has one of these outcomes.
For example, in car rentals, the following conversa-
tion flow is pre-defined for the agent. In practice
most calls to a car rental center follow this call flow.
? Opening - contains greeting, brand name, name
of agent
? Pick-up and return details - agent asks location,
dates and times of pick up and return, etc.
? Offering car and rate - agent offers a car spec-
ifying rate and mentions applicable special of-
fers.
? Personal details - agent asks for customer?s in-
formation such as name, address, etc.
? Confirm specifications - agent recaps reserva-
tion information such as name, location, etc.
? Mandatory enquiries - agent verifies clean driv-
ing record, valid license, etc.
? Closing - agent gives confirmation number and
thanks the customer for calling.
In these conversations the participants speak in turns
and the segments can be clearly identified. Figure 1
shows part of a transcribed call.
Each call has a specific outcome. For example,
each car rental transaction has one of two call types,
reservation or unbooked, as an outcome.
Because the call process is pre-defined, the con-
versations look similar in spite of having different
results. In such a situation, finding the differences in
the conversations that have effects on the outcomes
459
is very important, but it is very expensive and dif-
ficult to find such unknown differences by human
analysis. We show that it is possible to define proper
viewpoints and corresponding expressions leading
to insights on how to change the outcomes of the
calls.
AGENT: Welcome to CarCompanyA. My name is Albert. How may I
help you?
.........
AGENT: Allright may i know the location you want to pick the
car from.
CUSTOMER: Aah ok I need it from SFO.
AGENT: For what date and time.
.........
AGENT: Wonderful so let me see ok mam so we have a 12 or 15
passenger van avilable on this location on those dates and
for that your estimated total for those three dates just
300.58$ this is with Taxes with surcharges and with free
unlimited free milleage.
.........
AGENT : alright mam let me recap the dates you want to pick
it up from SFO on 3rd August and drop it off on august 6th in
LA alright
CUSTOMER : and one more questions Is it just in states or
could you travel out of states
.........
AGENT : The confirmation number for your booking is 221 384.
CUSTOMER : ok ok Thank you
Agent : Thank you for calling CarCompanyA and you have a
great day good bye

3 Trigger Segment Detection and Effective
Expression Extraction
In this section, we describe a method for automat-
ically identifying valuable segments and concepts
from the data for the user-specified difference anal-
ysis. First, we present a model to represent the con-
versational data. After that we introduce a method
to detect the segments where the useful concepts for
the analysis appear. Finally, we select useful expres-
sions in each detected trigger segment.
3.1 Data Model
Each conversational data record in the collection D
is defined as di. Each di can be seen as a sequence
of conversational turns in the conversational data,
and then di can be divided as
di = d1i + d2i + ? ? ?+ dMii , (1)
where dki is the k-th turn in di and Mi is the total
number of turns in di. The + operator in the above
equation can be seen as an equivalent of the string
concatenation operator. We define d?ji as the por-
tion of di from the beginning to turn j. Using the
same notation, d?ji = d1i + d2i + ? ? ? + dji . The
collection of d?mki constitutes the Chronologically
Cumulative Data up to turn mk (Dk). Dk is repre-
sented as
Dk = (d?mk1 ,d?mk2 , . . . ,d?mkn ). (2)
Figure 2 shows an image of the data model. We set
some mk and prepare the chronologically cumula-
tive data set as shown in Figure 3. We represent bi-
nary mutually exclusive business outcomes such as
success and failure resulting from the conversations
as ?A? and ?not A?.

tional data
3.2 Trigger Segment Detection
Trigger segments can be viewed as portions of the
data which have important features which distin-
guish data of class ?A? from data of class ?not A?.
460
To detect such segments, we divide each chrono-
logically cumulative data set Dk into two data sets,
training data Dtrainingk and test data Dtestk . Start-
ing from D1, for each Dk we trained a classifier
using Dtrainingk and evaluated it on Dtestk . Using
accuracy, the fraction of correctly classified docu-
ments, as a metric of performance (Yang and Liu,
1999), we denote the evaluation result of the cat-
egorization as acc(categorizer(Dk)) for each Dk
and plot it along with its turn. Figure 4 shows the
effect of gradually increasing the training data for
the classification. The distribution of expressions

Figure 4: Plot of acc(categorizer(Dk))
in a business-oriented conversation will change al-
most synchronously because the call flow is pre-
defined. Therefore acc(categorizer(Dk)) will in-
crease if features that contribute to the categorization
appear in Dk. In contrast, acc(categorizer(Dk))
will decrease if no features that contribute to
the categorization are in Dk. Therefore, from
the transitions of acc(categorizer(Dk)), we can
identify the segments with increases as triggers
where the features that have an effect on the out-
come appear. We denote a trigger segment as
seg(start position, end position). Because the to-
tal numbers of turns can be different, we do not
detect the last section as a trigger. In Figure 4,
seg(m1,m2) and seg(m4,m5) are triggers. It is
important to note that using the cumulative data is
key to the detection of trigger segments. Using non-
cumulative segment data would give us the catego-
rization accuracy for the features within that seg-
ment but would not tell us whether the features of
this segment are improving the accuracy or decreas-
ing it. It is this gradient information between seg-
ments that is key to identifying trigger segments.
Many approaches have been proposed for docu-
ment classification (Yang and Liu, 1999). In this
research, however, we are not interested in the clas-
sification accuracy itself but in the increase and de-
crease of the accuracy within particular segments.
For example, the greeting, or the particular method
of payment may not affect the outcome, but the
mention of a specific feature of the product may
have an effect on the outcome. Therefore in our
research we are interested in identifying the partic-
ular portion of the call where this product feature
is mentioned, along with its mention, which has an
effect on the outcome of the call. In our experi-
ments we used the SVM (Support Vector Machine)
classifier (Joachims, 1998), but almost any classifier
should work because our approach does not depend
on the classification method.
3.3 Effective Expression Extraction
In this section, we describe our method to extract
effective expressions from the detected trigger seg-
ments.
The effective expressions in Dk are those which
are representative in the selected documents and
appear for the first time in the trigger segments
seg(mi,mj). Numerous methods to select features
exist (Hisamitsu and Niwa, 2002) (Yang and Ped-
ersen, 1997). We use the ?2 statistic for each ex-
pression in Dk as a representative metric. For the
two-by-two contingency table of a expression w and
a class ?A? shown in Table 1, the ?2 statistic is cal-
culated as
Table 1: Contingency table for calculating the ?2
statistic
# of documents # of documents
including w not including w
A n11 n12
not-A n21 n22
?2 = N(n11n22 ? n12n21)
2
(n11 + n12)(n11 + n21)(n12 + n22)(n21 + n22) (3)
where N is the number of documents. This statis-
tic can be compared to the ?2 distribution with one
degree of freedom to judge representativeness.
We also want to extract the expressions that have
not had an effect on the outcome before Dk. To de-
tect the new expressions in Dk, we define the metric
461
new(w) = w(Dk)max(w(Dk?1), 1)/
mk
mk?1
?sign(w(DAk )? w(DnotAk )), (4)
where w(Dk) is the frequency of expression w in
the chronologically cumulative data Dk, max(a, b)
selects the larger value in the arguments, mk is the
number of turns in Dk, w(DAk ) is the frequency of
w in Dk with the outcome of the corresponding data
being ?A?, and sign(?) is the signum function. When
w in class ?A? appears in Dk much more frequently
than Dk?1 compared with the ratio of their turns,
this metric will be more than 1. We detect signifi-
cant expressions by considering the combined score
?2(w) ? new(w). Using this combined score, we
can filter out the representative expressions that have
already appeared before Dk and distinguish signifi-
cant expressions that first appear in Dk for each class
?A? and ?not A?.
3.4 Appropriate Viewpoint Selection
In a text mining system, to get an association that
leads to a useful insight, we have to define appro-
priate viewpoints. Viewpoints refer to objects in re-
lation to other objects. In analysis using a conven-
tional text mining system (Nasukawa and Nagano,
2001), the viewpoints are selected based on expres-
sions in user dictionaries prepared by domain ex-
perts. We have identified important segments of the
conversations by seeing changes in the accuracy of a
categorizer designed to segregate different business
outcomes. We have also been able to extract effec-
tive expressions from these trigger segments to de-
fine various viewpoints. Hence, viewpoint selection
is now based on the trigger segments and effective
expressions identified automatically based on speci-
fied business outcomes. In the next section we apply
our technique to a real life dataset and show that we
can successfully select useful viewpoints.
4 Experiments and Results
4.1 Experiment Data and System
We collected 914 recorded calls from the car rental
help desk and manually transcribed them. Figure 1
shows part of a call that has been transcribed.
There are three types of calls:
1. Reservation Calls: Calls which got converted.
Here, ?converted? means the customer made a
reservation for a car. Reserved cars can get
picked-up or not picked-up, so some reserved
cars do not eventually get picked-up by cus-
tomers (no shows and cancellations).
2. Unbooked Calls: Calls which did not get con-
verted.
3. Service Calls: Customers changing or enquir-
ing about a previous booking.
The distribution of the calls is given in Table 2.
Table 2: Distribution of calls
Unbooked Calls 461
Reservation Calls (Picked-Up) 72
Reservation Calls (Not Picked-Up) 65
Service Calls 326
Total Calls 914
The reservation calls are most important in this
context, so we focus on those 137 calls. In the reser-
vation calls, there are two types of outcomes, car
picked-up and car not picked-up. All reservation
calls look similar in spite of having different out-
comes (in terms of pick up). The reservation hap-
pens during the call but the pick up happens at a
later date. If we can find differences in the conver-
sation that affect the outcome, it is expected that we
could improve the agent productivity. Reservation
calls follow the pre-defined reservation call flow that
we mentioned in Section 2 and it is very difficult
to find differences between them manually. In this
experiment, by using the proposed method, we try
to extract trigger segments and expressions to find
viewpoints that affect the outcome of the reservation
calls.
For the analysis, we constructed a text mining sys-
tem for the difference analysis ?picked-up? vs. ?not
picked-up?. The experimental system consists of
two parts, an information extraction part and a text
mining part. In the information extraction part we
define dictionaries and templates to identify useful
expressions. In the text mining part we define appro-
priate viewpoints based on the identified expressions
to get useful associations leading to useful insights.

4.2 Results of Trigger Segment Detection and
Effective Expression Extraction
Based on the pre-defined conversation flow de-
scribed in Section 2, we set m1=1, m2=2,
m3=5, m4=10, m5=15, and m6=20 and prepared
D1, . . . , D6 and D. The features of di consist of
nouns, compound nouns, specified noun phrases
(e.g. adjective+noun), and verbs. For each Dk
we calculated acc(categorizer(Dk)) for the classes
?picked-up? and ?not picked-up.? In this process, we
use a SVM-based document categorizer (Joachims,
2002). Of the 137 calls, we used 100 calls for
training the categorizer and 37 calls for trigger
segment detection. Figure 5 shows the results of
acc(categorizer(Dk)) for picked-up. The accuracy
of classification using the data of entire conversa-
tions (acc(categorizer(D)) is 67.6% but we are try-
ing to detect important segments by considering not
the accuracy values themselves but the gradients be-
tween segments. From these results, seg(1, 2) and

seg(10, 15) are detected as trigger segments. We
now know that these segments are highly correlated
to the outcome of the call.
For each detected trigger segment, we extract ef-
fective expressions in each class using the metric de-
scribed in Section 3.3. Table 3 shows some expres-
sions with high values for the metric for each trigger.
In this table, ?just NUMERIC dollars? is a canonical
expression and an expression such as ?just 160 dol-
lars? is mapped to this canonical expression in the
information extraction process. From this result, in
seg(1, 2), ?make?, ?reservation? are correlated with
?pick up? and ?rate? and ?check? are correlated with
Table 3: Selected expressions in trigger segments

seg(10, 15) number, corporate program, go, impala
contract, card, have,
tax surcharge,

discount, customer club,

?not-picked up?. By looking at some documents
containing these expressions, we found customer in-
tention phrases such as ?would like to make a reser-
vation?, ?want to check a rate?, etc. Therefore, it
can be induced that the way a customer starts the
call may have an impact on the outcome. From ex-
pressions in seg(10, 15), it can be said that discount-
related phrases and mentions of the good rates by the
agent can have an effect on the outcome.
We can directly apply the conventional methods
for representative feature selection to D. The fol-
lowing expressions were selected as the top 20 ex-
pressions from whole conversational data by using
the ?2 metric defined in (3).
corporate program, contract, counter, September,
mile, rate, economy, last name,
valid driving license,BRAND NAME, driving,
telephone, midsize, tonight, use, credit, moment,
airline, afternoon
From these results, we see that looking at the call as
a whole does not point us to the fact that discount-
related phrases, or the first customers-utterance, af-
fect the outcome. Detecting trigger segments and
extracting important expressions from each trigger
segment are key to identifying subtle differences be-
tween very similar looking calls that have entirely
opposite outcomes.
4.3 Results of Text Mining Analysis using
Selected Viewpoints and Expressions
From the detected segments and expressions we de-
termined that the customer?s first utterance along
with discount phrases and value selling phrases af-
fected the call outcomes. Under these hypotheses,
we prepared the following semantic categories.
463
? Customer intention at start of call: From the
customer?s first utterance, we extract the fol-
lowing intentions based on the patterns.
? strong start: would like to make a booking,
need to pick up a car, . . .
? weak start: would like to check the rates,
want to know the rate for vans, . . .
Under our hypotheses, the customer with a
strong start has the intention of booking a car
and we classify such a customer as a book-
ing customer. The customer with a weak start
usually just wants to know the rates and is clas-
sified as a rates customer.
? discount-related phrases: discount, corporate
program, motor club, buying club . . . are reg-
istered into the domain dictionary as discount-
related phrases.
? value selling phrases: we extract phrases men-
tioning good rates and good vehicles by match-
ing patterns related to such utterances.
? mentions of good rates: good rate, won-
derful price, save money, just need to pay
this low amount, . . .
? mentions of good vehicles: good car, fan-
tastic car, latest model, . . .
Using these three categories, we tried to find insights
to improve agent productivity.
Table 4 shows the result of two-dimensional as-
sociation analysis for 137 reservation calls. This ta-
ble shows the association between customer types
based on customer intention at the start of a call
and pick up information. From these results, 67%
Table 4: Association between customer types and
pick up information
Customer types extracted from texts Pick up information
based on customer intent at start of call pick up not-picked up
booking customer (w/ strong start) (70) 47 23
rates customer (w/ weak start) (37) 13 24
(47 out of 70) of the booking customers picked up
the reserved car and only 35% (13 out of 37) of the
rates customers picked it up. This supports our hy-
pothesis and means that pick up is predictable from
the customer?s first or second utterance.
It was found that cars booked by rates customers
tend to be ?not picked up,? so if we can find any
actions by agents that convert such customers into
?pick up,? then the revenue will improve. In the
booking customer case, to keep the ?pick up? high,
we need to determine specific agent actions that con-
cretize the customer?s intent.
Table 5 shows how mentioning discount-related
phrases affects the pick up ratios for rates customers
and booking customers. From this table, it can
Table 5: Association between mention of discount
phrases and pick up information
Rates customer Pick up information
Mention of discount phrases by agents pick up not-picked up
yes (21) 10 11
no (16) 3 13
Booking customer Pick up information
Mention of discount phrases by agents pick up not picked up
yes (40) 30 10
no (30) 17 13
be seen that mentioning discount phrases affects
the final status of both types of customers. In the
rates customer case, the probability that the booked
car will be picked up, P (pick-up) is improved to
0.476 by mentioning discount phrases. This means
customers are attracted by offering discounts and
this changes their intention from ?just checking rate?
to ?make a reservation here?. We found similar
trends for the association between mention of value
selling phrases and pick up information.
4.4 Improving Agent Productivity
From the results of the text mining analysis experi-
ment, we derived the following actionable insights:
? There are two types of customers in reservation
calls.
? Booking customer (with strong start)
tends to pick up the reserved car.
? Rates customer (with weak start) tends
not to pick up the reserved car.
? In the rates customer case, ?pick up? is im-
proved by mentioning discount phrases.
By implementing the actionable insights derived
from the analysis in an actual car rental process, we
verified improvements in pick up. We divided the
83 agents in the car rental reservation center into
two groups. One of them, consisting of 22 agents,
was trained based on the insights from the text min-
ing analysis. The remaining 61 agents were not
told about these findings. By comparing these two
464
groups over a period of one month we hoped to see
how the actionable insights contributed to improv-
ing agent performance. As the evaluation metric, we
used the pick up ratio - that is the ratio of the number
of ?pick-ups? to the number of reservations.
Following the training the pick up ratio of the
trained agents increased by 4.75%. The average
pick up ratio for the remaining agents increased by
2.08%. Before training the ratios of both groups
were comparable. The seasonal trends in this indus-
try mean that depending on the month the bookings
and pickups may go up or down. We believe this
is why the average pick up ratio for the remaining
agents also increased. Considering this, it can be es-
timated that by implementing the actionable insights
the pick up ratio for the pilot group was improved by
about 2.67%. We confirmed that this difference is
meaningful because the p-value of the t-test statistic
is 0.0675 and this probability is close to the stan-
dard t-test (?=0.05). Seeing this, the contact center
trained all of its agents based on the insights from
the text mining analysis.
5 Discussion
There has been a lot of work on specific tools for
analyzing the conversational data collected at con-
tact centers. These include call type classification
for the purpose of categorizing calls (Tang et al,
2003) (Zweig et al, 2006), call routing (Kuo and
Lee, 2003) (Haffner et al, 2003), obtaining call log
summaries (Douglas et al, 2005), agent assisting
and monitoring (Mishne et al, 2005), and building
of domain models (Roy and Subramaniam, 2006).
Filtering problematic dialogs automatically from an
automatic speech recognizer has also been studied
(Hastie et al, 2002) (Walker et al, 2002). In con-
trast to these technologies, in this paper we con-
sider the task of trying to find insights from a col-
lection of complete conversations. In (Nasukawa
and Nagano, 2001), such an analysis was attempted
for agent-entered call summaries of customer con-
tacts by extracting phrases based on domain-expert-
specified viewpoints. In our work we have shown
that even for conversational data, which is more
complex, we could identify proper viewpoints and
prepare expressions for each viewpoint. Call sum-
maries by agents tend to mask the customers? inten-
tion at the start of the call. We get more valuable
insights from the text mining analysis of conversa-
tional data. For such an analysis of conversational
data, our proposed method has an important role.
With our method, we find the important segments
in the data for doing analyses. Also our analyses are
closely linked to the desired outcomes.
In trigger detection, we created a chronologically
cumulative data set based on turns. We can also
use the segment information such as the ?opening?
and ?enquiries? described in Section 2. We prepared
data with segment information manually assigned,
made the chronologically cumulative data and ap-
plied our trigger detection method. Figure 6 shows
the results of acc(categorizer(Dk)). The trend in

Figure 6: Result of acc(categorizer(Dk)) using
segment information
Figure 6 is similar to that in Figure 5. From this
result, it is observed that ?opening? and ?offering?
segments are trigger segments. Usually, segmenta-
tion is not done in advance and to assign such infor-
mation automatically we need data with labeled seg-
mentation information. The results show that even
in the absence of labeled data our trigger detection
method identifies the trigger segments. In the exper-
iments in Section 4, we set turns for each chrono-
logically cumulative data by taking into account the
pre-defined call flow.
In Figure 5 we observe that the accuracy of the
categorizer is decreasing even when using increas-
ing parts of the call. Even the accuracy using the
complete call is less than using only the first turn.
This indicates that the first turn is very informative,
but it also indicates that the features are not being
used judiciously. In a conventional classification
task, the number of features are sometimes restricted
465
when constructing a categorizer. It is known that se-
lecting only significant features improves the clas-
sification accuracy (Yang and Pedersen, 1997). We
used Information Gain for selecting features from
the document collection. This method selects the
most discriminative features between two classes.
As expected the classification accuracy improved
significantly as we reduced the total number of fea-
tures from over 2,000 to the range of 100 to 300.
Figure 7 shows the changes in accuracy. In the pro-

Figure 7: Result of acc(categorizer(Dk)) with top
100 to 300 features selected using information gain
posed method, we detect trigger segments using the
increases and decreases of the classification accu-
racy. By selecting features, the noisy features are not
added in the segments. Decreasing portions, there-
fore are not observed. In this situation, as a trigger
segment, we can detect the portion where the gra-
dient of the accuracy curve increases. Also using
feature selection, we find that the classification ac-
curacy is highest when using the entire document,
which is expected. However, we notice that the trig-
ger segments obtained with and without feature se-
lection are almost the same.
In the experiment, we use manually transcribed
data. As future work we would like to use the noisy
output of an automatic speech recognition system to
obtain viewpoints and expressions.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed methods for iden-
tifying appropriate segments and expressions auto-
matically from the data for user specified difference
analysis. We detected the trigger segments using the
property that a business-oriented conversation fol-
lows a pre-defined flow. After that, we identified
the appropriate expressions from each trigger seg-
ment. It was found that in a long business-priented
conversation there are important segments affecting
the outcomes that can not been easily detected by
just looking through the conversation, but such seg-
ments can be detected by monitoring the changes
of the categorization accuracy. For the trigger seg-
ment detection, we do not use semantic segment in-
formation but only the positional segment informa-
tion based on the conversational turns. Because our
method does not rely on the semantic information in
the data, therefore our method can be seen as robust.
Through experiments with real conversational data,
using identified segments and expressions we were
able to define appropriate viewpoints and concepts
leading to insights for improving the car rental busi-
ness process.
