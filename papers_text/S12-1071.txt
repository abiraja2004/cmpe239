Abstract
We describe a system proposed for measuring
the degree of relational similarity beetwen a
pair of words at the Task #2 of Semeval 2012.
The approach presented is based on a vec-
torial representation using the following fea-
tures: i) the context surrounding the words
with a windows size = 3, ii) knowledge ex-
tracted from WordNet to discover several se-
mantic relationships, such as meronymy, hy-
ponymy, hypernymy, and part-whole between
pair of words, iii) the description of the pairs
with their POS tag, morphological informa-
tion (gender, person), and iv) the average num-
ber of words separating the two words in text.
1 Introduction
The Task # 2 of Semeval 2012 focuses on measuring
the degree of relational similarity between the ref-
erence words pairs (training) and the test pairs for a
given class (Jurgens et al, 2012).
The training data set consists of 10 classes and
the testing data set consists of the 69 classes. These
datasets as well as the particularities of the task are
better described at overview paper (Jurgens et al,
2012). In this paper we report the approach submit-
ted to the competition, which is based on a vector
space model representation for each pair (Salton et
al., 1975). With respect to the type of features used,
we have observed that Fabio Celli (Celli, 2010) con-
siders that contextual information is useful, as well
the lexical and semantic information are in the ex-
traction of semantic relationships task. Additionally,
in (Chen et al, 2010) and (Negri and Kouylekov,
2010) are proposed WordNet based features with the
same purpose.
In the experiments carried out in this paper, we
use a set of lexical, semantic, WordNet-based and
contextual features which allows to construct the
vectors. Actually, we have tested a subset of the 20
contextual features proposed by Celli (Celli, 2010)
and some of those proposed by Chen (Chen et al,
2010) and Negri (Negri and Kouylekov, 2010).
The cosine similarity measure is used for deter-
mining the degree of relational similarity (Frakes
and Baeza-Yates, 1992) among the vectors.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 describes the system employed. Section
3 show the obtained results. Finally, in Section 4 the
final conclusions are given.
2 System description
The approach reported in this paper measures the
relational similarity of a set of word pairs that be-
long to the same semantic relationship. Those word
pairs are represented by means of the vector space
model (Salton et al, 1975). Each value of the vec-
tor represents the average value of the correspond-
ing feature. This average is calculated using 100
samples obtained from Internet by employing the
Google search engine. The search process is car-
ried out assuming that those words co-occurring in
the same context contain some kind of semantic re-
lationship.
Let (w1, w2) be a word pair, then the vectorial
representation of this pair (~x) using semantic, con-
textual, lexical, and WordNet-based features may be
expressed as it can be seen in Eq. (1).
502
~x = (avg(f1), avg(f2), ..., avg(fn)) (1)
where avg(fk) is the average value of the feature fk.
The cardinality of the vector is 42, because we
extracted 4 lexical features, 6 semantic features, 7
WordNet-based features and 25 contextual features
(n = 42). Each word pair is then represented by
a unique vector with values associated to each fea-
ture. In Figure 1, we show the vectorial represen-
tation of the word pair (transportation, bus) using
a unique text sample (s). In this example, the num-
ber and type of features described below is followed,
i.e., the first 4 values are lexical, the following 6 are
semantic and so on.
s =?The Toyama Chih Railway is a transporta-
tion company that operates railway, tram, and
bus lines in the eastern part of the prefecture.?
~x = (6, 1, 0, 0, 27, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 4, 5, 25, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4,
4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4)
Figure 1: Example of a feature vector for a word pair and
its corresponding sentence s.
The previous example is only illustrative, since
we have gathered 100 sentence per word pair. In
total, we collected a corpus containing 2,054,687 to-
kens, with a average class terms of 26,684 and with
an average class vocabulary of 4,006.
The features extracted are described as follows:
2.1 Lexical features
The lexical features describe morphologically and
syntactically the word pair (w1, w2). The lexical
features extracted are the following:
? Average number of words separating the two
words (w1, w2) in the text.
? The position of w1 with respect to w2 in the
text. If w1 appears before w2 then the feature
value is 1, otherwise, the value is 2.
? The Part of Speech Tag for each word in the
pair (two features). We use the FreeLing PoS-
tagger (Padro? et al, 2010) for obtaining the
grammatical category. The possible values are
the following: adjective=1; adverb=2; arti-
cle=3; noun=4; verb=5; pronoun=6; conjunc-
tion=7; preposition=8
2.2 Semantic features
The following four semantic features are boolean
values (true or false) indicating:
? If w1 and w2 are named entities (two features)1.
? If w1 and w2 are entities defined (two fea-
tures)2.
The following two semantic features indicate:
? The type of prepositional phrase in case of
existing for w1 and w2. The feature val-
ues are nominal: about=1; after=2; at=3; be-
hind=4; between=5; by=6; except=7; from=8;
into=9; near=10; of=11; over=12; through=13;
until=14; under=15; upon=16; without=17;
above=18; among=19; before=20; below=21;
beside=22; but=23; down=24; for=25; in=26;
on=27; since=28; to=29; with=30.
2.3 WordNet-based features
The semantic features are boolean values (true or
false) indicating whether or not w2 is contained in:
? the synonym set of w1
? the antonym set of w1
? the meronymy set of w1
? the hyponymy set of w1
? the hypernymy set of w1
? the part-whole set of w1
? the gloss set of w1
We used WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) in order to de-
termine the relationship set for word w1.
1A named entity is defined by a Proper Noun Phrase, which
was detected using the module NER-Named Entity Recognition
of the FreeLing 2.1 tool.
2A defined sentence is one that begins with a definite article.
503
2.4 Contextual features
Contextual features considers values for the words
that occur in the context of w1 and w2 (in a window
size of 3). The description of those features follows.
? Nominal values indicating the Part of Speech
Tag (adjective=1; adverb=2; article=3; noun=4;
verb=5; pronoun=6; conjunction=7; preposi-
tion=8) for the three words at:
? the left context of w1 (three features).
? the right context of w1 (three features).
? the left context of w2 (three features).
? the right context of w2 (three features).
? A Nominal value indicating number of the fol-
lowing grammatical categories between w1 and
w2: verbs, adjectives and nouns (three fea-
tures).
? Nominal values indicating the frequencies of
the verbs: be, do, have, locate, know, make, use,
become, include, take between w1 and w2 (ten
features).
2.5 Feature selection
We carried out a feature selection process with the
aim of discarding irrelevant features. In this step,
we apply the attribute selection filter reported in
(Hall, 1999), that evaluates the worth of a subset
of attributes by considering the individual predic-
tive ability of each feature along with the degree of
redundancy between them and an exhaustive search
method.
The following features were obtained as relevant:
the average number of words between w1 and w2;
Named Entity of w1 and w2; phrase defined of w1
and w2; prepositional phrase type w1 and w2; part
of speech tag w1 and w2; part of speech tag of
right context of w1 with a windows size of 3; oc-
currences of verbs between w1 and w2; frequency of
verbs be, do, make, locate, take; synonym, antonym,
meronymy, hyponymy, hypernymy, part-whole and
gloss relationships between w1 and w2.
After applying the aforementioned feature selec-
tion method, we removed 17 features, and the vec-
torial representation of each word pair will be done
with only 25 values (features).
2.6 Determining the degree of similarity
We have used the features mentioned before for con-
structing a prototype vector representing a given se-
mantic class. In order to do so, we have employed
the training corpus for gathering samples from Inter-
net and, thereafter, we average the feature values in
order to construct such prototype vector.
For each word pair in the test dataset, we ob-
tained a vector using the same process explained
before. We determined the similarity for each test
feature vector with respect to the prototype of the
given class by using the cosine similarity coefficient
(Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), i.e., measuring the
cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
In this way, we obtain a similarity measure of each
test word pair with respect to its corresponding class.
Finally, we may output a ranking of all the word
pairs at the test dataset by sorting these similarity
values obtained.
3 Experimental results
The approach submitted to the Task #2 of SemEval
2012 obtained very poor results. The Spearman cor-
relation coefficient, which measured the correlation
of the approach with respect to the gold standard, it
is quite low (see Table 1).
Team-Algorithm Spearman MaxDiff
UTD-NB 0.23 39.4
UTD-SVM 0.12 34.7
DULUTH-V0 0.05 32.4
DULUTH-V1 0.04 31.5
DULUTH-V2 0.04 31.1
BUAP 0.01 31.7
Random 0.02 31.2
Table 1: Spearman and MaxDiff scores obtained at the
Task #2 of Semeval 2012
Actually, it shows that the run submitted does not
correlate with the gold standard. We consider that
this behavior is derived from the nature of the sup-
port corpus used for obtaining the features set. The
number of sentences (100) used for representing the
word pairs was not enough for constructing a real
prototype of both, the semantic class and the word
pairs. A further analysis will confirm this issue.
504
Despite this limitation we note that the MaxDiff
score was 31.7% slightly above the baseline (31.2%)
and not far from the best score of the task (39.4%).
That is, we achieved an average of 31.7% of ques-
tions answered correctly.
4 Discussion and conclusion
In this paper we report the set of features used in
the approach submitted for measuring the degrees of
relational similarity between a given reference word
pair and a variety of other pairs. The results obtained
are not encouraging with a Spearman correlation co-
efficient close to zero, which mean that there are
not correlation between the run submitted and the
gold standard. A deeper analysis of the approach is
needed in order to determine if the limitation of the
system falls in the features used, the similarity mea-
sure, or the support corpus used for extracting the
features.
