Abstract
In the scope of the TELRI concerted
action a working group is investigat-
ing the formation of a tool catalogue
and repository. The idea is similar to
that of the ACL Natural Language Soft-
ware Registry, but the contents should
be mostly limited to corpus processing
tools available free of cost for research
use. The catalogue should also offer
a help-line for installing and using the
software. The paper reports on the set-
up of this catalogue, and concentrates
on the technical issues involved in its
creation, storage and display. This in-
volves the form interface on the Web,
the XML DocBook encoding, and the
XSL stylesheets used to present the cat-
alogue either on the Web or in print.
The paper lists the current entries in the
catalogue and discusses plans for their
expansion and maintenance.
1 Introduction
The ?Trans-European Language Resources In-
frastructure?, TELRI (http://www.telri.de/), is a
pan-European alliance of focal national language
(technology) institutions with the emphasis on
Central and Eastern European and NIS countries.
Some of the main objectives of TELRI is to col-
lect, promote, and make available monolingual
and multilingual language resources and tools
for the extraction of language data and linguis-
tic knowledge; to provide a forum where experts
from academia and industry share and assess tools
and resources; and to make available the expertise
of its partner institutions to the research commu-
nity, to language industry and to the general pub-
lic.
A number of these goals is being served
by the ?TELRI Research Archive of Com-
putational Tools and Resources?, TRACTOR,
(http://www.tractor.de), which features monolin-
gual, bilingual, and multilingual corpora and lex-
ica in a wide variety of languages as well as
corpus- and lexicon-related software. While the
primary aim is to pool the resources of TELRI
partners, TRACTOR also serves other institutions
by making the resources and tools available to the
wider research and educational community.
While the TRACTOR archives already offer a
number of tools, the longer term objective is to
offer a more substantial catalogue of corpus and
lexicon processing software. Furthermore, the
software itself is not necessarily available directly
from TRACTOR, which would also have a more
formalised structure and a well-defined process
of updating and presenting its entries. A closely
related initiative and model for this effort is the
?The Natural Language Software Registry? of the
ACL hosted at DFKI, a new edition of which was
released in 2000 (Declerck et al, 2000). While
the ACL registry offers a much larger array of
tools, the TELRI catalogue should have the ad-
vantage that each entry also contains a pointer to
the TELRI member who is able to offer advice on
installing and using the tool in question.
Other related catalogues on the Web
are the CTI?s Guide to Digital Resources
(http://info.ox.ac.uk/ctitext/resguide/) which has
a section on Text Analysis Tools and Techniques.
However, it does not seem to be maintained any
longer.
The Summer Institute of Linguistics
(http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/) also
hosts a repository containing more than 60
pieces of software developed at SIL. Most of the
software is available for free download; the latest
update to the pages comes spring 1999.
A view on sharing resources, very much
based on latest standardisation initiatives, has
been developed by the Open Language Archives
Community, OLAC, (Bird and Simons, 2000),
http://www.language-archives.org/. OLAC is an
international project to construct an infrastructure
aimed at opening the whole array of language re-
sources, including texts, recordings, lexicons, an-
notations, software, protocols, models, and for-
mats. OLAC aims to develop community-specific
metadata to link language archives and establish
centralized catalogs. It builds directly on two
other initiatives, namely the the Open Archives
Initiative (developing and promoting interoper-
ability standards for efficient dissemination of
content) and the Dublin Core Metadata Initia-
tive (development of interoperable online meta-
data standards).
In the scope of the TELRI-II concerted action,
a working group has been set up to design a cata-
logue of corpus processing tools, and this paper
reports on the preliminary results of the work-
ing group. The rest of the paper is structured as
follows: Section 2 gives the overall structure of
the catalogue and its entries; Section 3 explains
the pipeline for updating and displaying the cat-
alogue, i.e. the Web form interface for input, ed-
itorial policy, and the stylesheet mechanism for
display; Section 4 lists the current contents of the
catalogue, while Section 5. gives some conclu-
sions and outlines plans for its expansion and fur-
ther maintenance.
2 Catalogue Format
The overall encoding chosen for the catalogue
was DocBook, an SGML/XML DTD primar-
ily used for encoding computer manuals and
other technical documentation. Choosing an
SGML/XML framework follows a similar strand
of research in annotating linguistic resources, as
exemplified in the XML version of the Corpus
Encoding Standard (Nancy et al, 2000) and in
work on syntactic annotation (Nancy and Romary,
2001). An advantage of XML is the possibility
of further standardisation by the use of related
recommendations, i.e. the XML Stylesheet Lan-
guage.
DocBook has a large user base and is well
documented: a reference book has been pub-
lished and is available on-line (Walsh, 1999)
for browsing or downloading. There is also an
interesting public initiative utilising DocBook,
namely the Linux Documentation Project, LDP
(http://www.linuxdoc.org/), which is working on
developing free, high quality documentation for
the GNU/Linux operating system.
Because DocBook is an application of SGML,
and, more recently, XML, many freely available
tools are available to process it. Most importantly,
this includes XSL processors, which can be used
to render DocBook documents in, say, HTML or
PDF; this issue is further elaborated in Section 4.
The complete catalogue is represented as one
<book> element, with introductory matter in
<bookinfo> giving the name, release informa-
tion and some other general information about
the catalogue. The catalogue is then divided (at
present) into three <chapter> elements, each
giving a a certain type of tools we plan to address:
 morpho-syntactic taggers
 concordancers
 aligners
Each catalogue entry is contained in
<sect1>, the top-level section element.
The section, besides containing a <title>
and being marked with an ID, is composed of
two <sect2> elements. The first gives the
information that is common to all sorts of tools,
while the second is tool-type specific.
The information records are encoded as <for-
malpara>, where each such element has a
<title>, followed by the text of the of the
record as a <para>. Various other DocBook el-
ements are used to annotate pieces of informa-
tion, e.g. <address>, <affiliation> and
similar details. Table 1 gives as an example a
complete dummy catalogue entry, where variable
parts are prefixed by ?this is?.

3 Catalogue input and output
While the initial catalogue was input di-
rectly with an SGML editor and then vali-
dated, the envisioned additions will be per-
formed via a Web form interface, available at
http://gnu.nytud.hu/telri/. Figure 1 displays the
top part of the screenshot of the HTML form de-
signed to collect the specification of description
of catalogue items.
The definition of the particular information
sought about the software tools required some
consideration. Obviously, we would like to have
as detailed a description of each item as possible.
On the other hand, one has to bear in mind that the
TELRI Catalogue will appeal for free voluntary
contributions. Hence, the form should be maxi-
mally easy to fill in with minimal effort in order
to avoid possibly deterring people from contribut-
ing who might otherwise have done so. The cru-
cial factor to consider was to find the right balance
between the set of required and optional items. In
the end, the required information fields were con-
fined to the bare minimum of name, task, descrip-
tion and TELRI helpline. Table 2 displays the full
list of questions used in the HTML form.
The form interface runs a Perl CGI script,
which mails the output, encoded as the above de-
scribed DocBook <sect1> element, to the ed-
itors of the catalogue. After checking, fresh en-
tries are included in the official release of the cat-
alogue.
The DocBook format is suitable for storage
and interchange, but it is, of course, not appro-
priate for displaying the information. However,
one of the benefits of using standardised solutions
is that conversion tools and specifications are, to
a large extent, already available. For presenta-
tion, we have been so far experimenting with the
XML Stylesheet Language, XSL, or, more pre-
cisely, XSLT, the XSL Transformation Language,
(W3C, 2000). XSLT is a recommendation of the
W3C and is a language for transforming XML
documents into other XML documents. There al-
ready exist several freely available XSLT proces-
sors, e.g., Xalan (http://xml.apache.org/xalan/),
produced by the Apache XML Project.
XSLT is most often used to produce HTML
output for viewing on the Web, and so called
Formatted Objects, which are then further
transformed into print formats, usually PDF.
For DocBook XML there exist ready-made
stylesheets for both kinds of output, made by
Norman Walsh and available at on the Web
(http://nwalsh.com/docbook/xsl/). In the current
version we have used these ?out of the box? tools
to render the catalogue, although some slight
modifications would be in order to produce out-
put better tailored to the catalogue application.
Figure 2 contains a sample HTML output of
one item in the Catalogue.
In summary, Figure 3 gives a graphical
overview of the data processing of the TELRI
Catalogue items.
4 Catalogue Contents
The catalogue currently contains only a few sam-
ple entries, which, nevertheless, exemplify the
kinds of software that are to be most relevant for
inclusion into the catalogue:
 tools that at least one TELRI partner has ex-
perience in using and that the partner is will-
ing to support for new users
 tools that are available free of cost, at least
for academic purposes and, preferably, are
open source
 tools that are language independent or adapt
easily to new languages
 tools that are primarily meant for corpus pro-
cessing
At present, the catalogue lists the following
tools:
 The morpho-syntactic tagger TnT (Brants,
2000)
A robust and very efficient statistical part-
of-speech tagger that is trainable on differ-
ent languages and on virtually any tagset. It
is available by a license agreement which is
free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
Distribution is available, in binaries only, for
Linux and SunOS/Solaris.

 The IMS Corpus Workbench concordancer
(Christ, 1994)
Comprises a powerful Corpus Query Proces-
sor and a graphical user interface. It is avail-
able by a license agreement which is free of
charge for non-commercial purposes. Distri-
bution, in binary form only, is available for
Linux and SunOS/Solaris.
 The Vanilla sentence aligner (Danielsson
and Ridings, 1997)
A simple but useful program that aligns
a parallel corpus by comparing sentence
lengths in characters by dynamic time-
warping. The program assumes that hard
boundaries are correctly aligned and per-
forms alignment on soft boundaries. It is
freely available with C source code distribu-
tion.
 The Twente Word Aligner (Hiemstra, 1998)
The program constructs a bilingual lexicon
from a parallel sentence aligned corpus. The
translations are ranked according to com-
puted confidence. The system uses statisti-
cal measures and works for single words (to-
kens) only. It is available under the GNU
General Public License and is written in C.
 PLUG Word Aligner (Ahrenberg et al,
1998)
The system integrates a set of modules for
knowledge-lite approaches to word align-
ment, with various possibilities to change
configuration and to adapt the system to
other language pairs and text types. The
system takes a parallel sentence aligned cor-
pus as input and produces a list of word and
phrase correspondences in the text (link in-
stances) and additionally a bilingual lexicon
from these instances (type links). It is avail-
able by a license agreement which is free of
charge for non-commercial purposes. Distri-
bution is available, in binary form only, for
Linux and MS Windows.
5 Conclusions
The paper reported on the set-up of the TELRI
corpus-tool catalogue, concentrating on the tech-
nical issues involved in its creation (form inter-
face), storage (DocBook) and display (XSLT). At
present, the input form is operational and the cata-
logue contains a few sample entries and has a pre-
liminary (default) rendering of its contents. The
current version of the catalogue and templates is
available at http://nl.ijs.si/telri/
In the future, we hope to flesh out the cat-
alogue with more tools, and enlist the services
of TELRI experts in providing user support for
them. The catalogue will, where license permits,
also archive a copy of the software, and will con-
tinue with a proactive adoption of the GNU li-
cense and open standards.
The open (non-profit) nature of the tools we
attempt to identify lends them well for pedago-
cial purposes at the graduate and undergraduate
courses in natural language processing, corpus
linguistics and language engineering.
The tool catalogue, as well as TRACTOR,
could also be made a part of the Open Language
Archives Community mentioned in the introduc-
tion. To join OLAC a number of changes and
mappings would have to be defined, say from the
on-line form onto Dublin Core and the OLAC
Metadata Set. The choices currently listed in the
template could also be changed into a controlled
vocabulary to facilitate searching.
The process of catalogue updates is currently
manual. To automate the production of the on-
line version of the catalogue directly from new
form entries would be relatively easy, given suf-
ficient volume to justify this. More challeng-
ing would be (semi)automatic tracking of new
tools that become available via various (OLAC)
archives and announcements.
