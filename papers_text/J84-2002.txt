This paper presents empirical results comparing spoken and keyboard communication. It is 
shown that speakers attempt o achieve more detailed goals in giving instructions than do users 
of keyboards. One specific kind of f ine-grained communicative act, a request hat the hearer 
identify the referent of a noun phrase, is shown to dominate spoken instruction-giving 
discourse, but is nearly absent from keyboard discourse. Most important, these requests are 
only achieved "indirectly". - through utterances whose surface forms do not explicitly convey 
the speakers' intent. A plan-based theory of communication is shown to uncover the speakers' 
intentions underlying many cases of indirect identification requests found in the corpus, once an 
action for referent identification has been posited. In so doing, the theory demonstrates how 
intent (or plan) recognition can be applied in reasoning about the use of a description. As a 
consequence of this approach, it is shown that the conditions on the planning of successful 
identification requests account for Searle's conditions on the act of referring. It is concluded 
that intent recognition will need to be a central focus for pragmatics/discourse components of 
future speech understanding systems, and that computational linguistics needs to develop 
formalisms for reasoning about speakers' use of descriptions. 
1 Introduction 
As natural language interaction with computers becomes 
more widespread, systems' abilities to engage users in 
discourse will become increasingly important. These 
capabil it ies will be especially in demand when users can 
speak naturally to their machines. Although it is widely 
suspected that spoken language is different from written 
language, the question of precisely what the differences 
are has only recently become a topic of computat ional  
linguistic research. Previous investigations have concen- 
trated on syntactic differences between spoken and writ- 
ten language (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982, 
Thompson 1980), with the goal of adapting parsing tech- 
niques to handle the syntax of spoken language. Howev-  
er, even if this goal were achieved, a system needs to be 
prepared to handle any unique propert ies of the discourse 
structure of spoken interaction if it is to be successful in 
conducting a dialogue. 
Of course, there has been much work on discourse 
processing within computat ional  linguistics (e.g., Grosz 
1977, Sidner 1979, Webber  1978), and any future 
systems will undoubtedly incorporate previously success- 
ful techniques. However,  one suspects that the coverage

Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
of discourse processing algorithms may depend on the 
corpora from which they were developed, and many of 
those reflect keyboard-mediated dialogue. Thus, to 
determine whether and how current techniques need to 
be adapted to the way people speak, research is needed 
to compare the discourse structure of spoken and 
keyboard interaction. 
This paper presents an empirical study and theoretical 
analysis of utterance form and function as determined by 
the communication modality. The two initial objectives 
are: 
1. To develop an empirical methodology for analyzing 
discourse pragmatics. 
2. To use that methodology to identify both the goals 
that speakers attempt to achieve in spoken and 
keyboard modalities, and the discourse and sentence 
structures they use in achieving those goals. 
These objectives are investigated in a study of instruc- 
tion-giving discourse, a communication task that inti- 
mately ties utterance function to a nonlinguistic task 
being accomplished by the conversants. In addition to 
depending on the communication task, the goals people 
achieve with language are a function, in part, of the 
communication situation - i.e., of how the speaker(s.), 
hearer(s), object(s) under discussion, and discourse itself 
are situated in the world. For example, the utterance 
"On the table is a little yellow piece of rubber," would be 
interpreted quite differently in a narrative than in a set of 
instructions for assembling an object. The communi- 
cation situation helps to determine the pragmatics of 
reference - what speakers intend hearers to do with refer- 
ring expressions. Thus, a third goal of this paper, a 
subsidiary to objective 2 is to consider 
3. How the speakers' goals for the interpretation of 
referring expressions are expressed and achieved in 
different modalities. 
Results indicate that speakers attempt o achieve more 
detailed referential goals in giving instructions than do 
users of keyboards. That is, speakers explicitly request 
hearers to identify the referents of noun phrases (NPs), 
but users of keyboards do not. Instead, the referential 
goals achieved by these requests are subsumed by other 
requested actions. Most importantly, these identification 
requests are only achieved "indirectly" - through utter- 
ances whose surface forms do not explicitly convey the 
speakers' intent. 
Current theories propose that the speaker's intentions 
underlying the use of indirect speech acts can be recog- 
nized as a by-product of a more general, independently 
motivated process of inferring a speaker's plans (Bruce 
1983, Cohen and Perrault 1979, Cohen and Levesque 
1980, Perrault and Allen 1980, Schmidt 1975, Sidner and 
Israel 1981). Essentially, illocutionary acts, which 
communicate the speaker's intentions, are regarded as 
steps in a speaker's plan, just as physical acts are. 
Furthermore, just as observing an agent's behavior may 
lead one to infer what the agent is trying to do, so too 
can the observation/understanding of a speaker's utter- 
ance lead an observer to infer the speaker's intentions. 
This approach has led to formal and computational 
models of discourse processing (Allen 1979; Allen and 
Perrault 1980; Brachman et al 1979; Cohen and 
Levesque, in preparation; Sidner et al 1981). Although 
these provide a more comprehensive account of indirect 
speech act interpretation than previous linguistic or philo- 
sophical approaches, they have not been tested against a 
corpus other than the ones that supported their creation 
(e.g., Horrigan 1977). Therefore, as an adequacy test, 
the fourth objective for this paper is: 
4. To evaluate how well a plan-based theory of 
communication can uncover the intentions underly- 
ing the use of many surface forms in the transcripts. 
The theory is shown to account for approximately 
70% of the indirect requests for referent identification 
found in the transcripts, once an action for referent iden- 
tification has been posited. An important aspect of the 
account is the demonstration that speakers and hearers 
can reason about referent identification much as they 
reason about other actions and plans. Hence, the last 
goal for this paper is to 
5. Contrast the plan-based analysis of referring, and 
the flexibility it allows, with Searle's account of 
reference as a speech act. 
I show that Searle's analysis cannot account for many 
of the examples treated here, and that those examples it 
does cover can also be handled by the present analysis. 
The conclusions I draw are specific to the conversa- 
tional task of giving instructions about objects physically 
present to the hearer. This task was chosen for four 
reasons: 
? First, it was expected that speakers would frequently 
issue requests. Because requests dominate interactions 
with many question-answering systems, and with most 
conceivable interactive applications of natural 
language processing, they have been extensively 
studied in computational linguistics. 
? Second, because the task is simple and constrained, it
provides an excellent adequacy test for proposed theo- 
ries and computational techniques; any theory of 
communication that cannot handle the phenomena of 
this study can hardly be called general. However, 
since the domain is functionally similar to those of 
various keyboard-based systems (Brachman et al 
1979, Robinson et al 1980, Winograd 1972), the data 
and results of the study may suggest directions for 
extending those systems. 
? Third, the domain is similar to those analyzed by other 
researchers (Chapanis et al 1972, Chapanis et al 
1977, Grosz 1977), and thus the dialogues could serve 
to confirm or refute their results.

Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
? Finally, instructions play a crucially important role in 
people's everyday lives - success in industrial, academ- 
ic, and bureaucratic tasks, for example, requires the 
following of instructions. Children are initially 
instructed face-to-face, but they eventually learn to 
follow written instructions. The present study, though 
not this paper, should ultimately provide a window on 
how the language of written instructions differs from 
that of instructional dialogue. 
In summary, this paper applies an empirical methodol- 
ogy for analyzing discourse pragmatics to compare 
spoken and keyboard language for an instruction-giving 
task. The primary differentiating phenomenon, the use 
of explicit identification requests, is used as an adequacy 
test for a plan-based theory of communication. 
Conversely, the theory is used to explicate how such 
communicative actions might be analyzed. Finally, the 
theory gives rise to a pragmatic analysis of referring that 
subsumes Searle's (1969). 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 discusses previous-research in a number of 
related areas. Section 3 isolates the phenomena of inter- 
est - referent identification. Section 4 describes the 
study and the method of discourse analysis, and Section 5 
presents and discusses the empirical results. Section 6 
sketches the plan-based theory of communication and 
applies the theory to key examples. Section 7 counters 
possible alternative xplanations that would purport to 
explain the data without recourse to an analysis of speak- 
er intent. Section 8 compares the analysis with Searle's, 
and suggests generalizations based on independently 
motivated principles. Finally, the appendices contain the 
materials, transcripts, and codings on which these 
analyses are based. A full set of coded transcripts may 
be obtained on request. 
2 Prev ious  Research  
Four traditions of research bear on the problems at hand: 
empirical work on differences between spoken and writ- 
ten language, discourse analysis, psychological studies of 
referential communication, and computational linguistics 
studies of discourse that have been based on observation 
of actual communicative interaction. 
The subject of oral/written language comparisons has 
received much attention from researchers: Anthropolo- 
gists have traditionally studied characteristics of "oral" 
and "literate" cultures; human-factors researchers have 
investigated the opportunities that particular modalities 
afford for effective communication; and educational 
psychologists, using empirical and anthropological meth- 
ods, have sought answers to children's reading and writ- 
ing problems in the study of oral/written language 
differences. 
Rubin (1980) discusses methodological weaknesses in 
many oral/written studies - weaknesses that stem from a 
simplistic division of language experiences into "oral" 
and "written". Instead, she classifies language experi- 
ences in terms of their characteristic values on several 
dimensions uch as: the use of voice or print, the ability 
of "speaker" and "hearer" to interact, their spatial 
and/or  temporal commonality, their mutual involvement 
in the discourse, and the concreteness of the referents. 
Face-to-face conversations about physically present 
objects are seen to lie at one extreme within this 
"communication space" (with "positive" values on the 
above dimensions), whereas written text is at the oppo- 
site. Other language xperiences that differ along these 
dimensions include communication by telephone, 
keyboard, audiotape, picturephone, writing, etc. 2 Rubin 
reports that many studies comparing language experi- 
ences present conclusions about oral/written language 
differences even though the language experiences differ 
from one another along multiple dimensions. In such 
cases it is not clear if the observed ifferences result, for 
example, from the presence of voice, the ability to inter- 
act, or both. 
There is evidence that at least some quantitative 
linguistic and efficacy results are primarily determined by 
the presence of voice in the communication modality. A 
series of studies by Chapanis and colleagues (Chapanis et 
al. 1972, Chapanis et al 1977) compared problem-solv- 
ing effectiveness among teams communicating in face-to- 
face, voice only, written, keyboard, and other 
communication modalities. Dependent measures 
included problem solution time, number of words, 
sentences, utterances, etc. Results indicate that problems 
are solved twice as fast in vocal modalities as they are in 
written ones, even though communicators use twice as 
many words when speaking. 3 Although motivating the 
development of speech-understanding systems, these 
results unfortunately tell us little about how the process- 
ing of spoken utterances differs from the processing of 
written ones. 
Other research as compared the syntax of spoken and 
written discourse. The primary findings are: Written 
language is syntactically more integrated than spoken, 
employing nominalizations, participles, complements, 
relative clauses, etc. (Chafe 1982); and spoken language 
exhibits regular patterns of false starts and hesitations 
(Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982). The former 
results can help a system designer to determine which 
syntactic onstructs to emphasize in a grammar for pars- 
ing. The latter results are more useful to computational 
z This approach essentially characterizes language situations as multidi- 
mensional vectors whose components, describing the above dimensions, 
are binary values (e.g., +/- voice). Thus, it is assumed that neighboring 
modalities afford equal communicative possibilities in all dimensions in 
which they are the same. This is obviously untrue for the dimension of 
interaction. 
3 Thompson (1980) has confirmed Chapanis et al's results for face-to- 
face and keyboard modalities.

Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
linguistics. Not only are regularities in nongrammatical 
speech identified, but a class of "editing" rules is 
provided that can make such utterances parsable. 
Current work on relaxing grammar ules and on parsing 
ill-formed input (Hayes and Mouradian 1981, Kwasny 
and Sondheimer 1981, Weischedel and Black 1980) is in 
much the same spirit. 
The purposes at hand require analyses of the pragmat- 
ic and discourse structure of actual dialogues. Grosz 
(1977) and Bruce (1981) (among others) have shown 
how such discourse analyses can have direct implications 
for algorithm design. In their work, transcripts of 
dialogues were collected and analyzed, leading to the 
development of algorithms for speech-understanding 
systems (Walker 1978, Woods et al 1976). 4 Grosz' 
analyses indicate that anaphoric reference in task-orient- 
ed dialogues is constrained by the hierarchical structure 
of the physical task. A parallel structuring of "focus 
spaces" was proposed as a mechanism to constrain the 
search for co-referents, and became the mainstay of the 
discourse component of two systems (Robinson et al 
1980, Walker 1978). Although this research did not 
directly address the problem of discovering cross-modal 
similarities and differences, the major finding of explicitly 
"stacked" topics serving to constrain co-reference was 
validated independently in a domain of casual, face-to- 
face conversation (Reichman 1981). 
Bruce's pragmatics component for the HWIM system 
was based on transcripts of human keyboard-mediated 
dialogues simulating interactions with a travel budget 
manager. Users were seen to be interacting in various 
"modes" (e.g., editing-a-trip mode, creating-a-trip mode, 
etc.). The system attempted to track the user's progress 
through these modes, using an ATN-based represen- 
tation, and thereby to create expectations of his/her 
future utterances. Discourse analysis revealed that users 
did not follow the strict embedding of subdialogues 
required by the ATN model. Consequently, the pragmat- 
ics component was reorganized as a "demand" model in 
which the system was seen as responding to one of a set 
of pending goals. Although this research did not directly 
address issues of cross-modal similarities and differences, 
it did point out the promise of a goal-oriented view of 
language processing. 
Many researchers in the field of discourse analysis 
have tried to identify goals or intentions in dialogue. For 
example, Labov and Fanshel (1977) analyzed transcripts 
of therapy sessions by employing the vocabulary of 
linguistics and speech act theory. Their analyses 
presented rules for interpreting the intentions behind 
utterances of various syntactic forms - e.g., rules for 
when a hearer will interpret utterances as indirect 
requests for physical action or verbal confirmation. 
However, these rules were stipulated as regularities of 
discourse rather than as derived from underlying proc- 
esses. Their findings should serve as data to be explained, 
rather than as a satisfying account of discourse. 
In research more relevant o computational linguistics, 
Mann et al (Mann, Moore, and Levin 1977; Mann, 
Carlisle, Moore, and Levin 1977) applied traditional 
empirical methods to the identification of speaker inten- 
tion and utterance function in dialogue. 5 Their goal was 
to build systems to replicate observers' scorings of tran- 
scripts. The observers, and ultimately the systems, were 
to identify repeated reference, requests, expressions of 
comprehension, topic structure, etc., in keyboard 
dialogues between a user and a computer operator, and 
in radio dialogues between Apollo astronauts and ground 
control. Much care was taken to develop a scoring 
scheme, train dialogue observers, and attain reliability 
Mann, Carlisle, Moore, and Levin 1977). A separate 
computer program was to have been built for processing 
each transcript. By merging the common features of 
these systems, an empirically-based theory and computa- 
tional model were to have been developed. This work 
resulted in a goal-directed, "dialogue games" model of 
conversational interaction (Levin and Moore 1977), 
though it is not clear whether the model's formulation 
resulted from the merging of implementations. 
Finally, there is a huge literature of psychological 
studies of referential communication. I will not survey it 
here (but see Dickson 1981 for recent papers and Asher 
1979 for an extensive review), but mention only two 
themes of relevance to this study. First, such work has 
shown that, in spoken interaction, noun phrase length 
tends to decrease as subsequent references to an object 
are made. However, in non-interactive spoken modalities 
(Krauss & Weinheimer 1966), the decrease for subse- 
quent references i lessened. These results indicate that 
efficiency in referential communication is a function of 
user feedback. 
The development of the component skills involved in 
referring is a second theme in this literature. In order to 
test Piaget's "egocentrism" hypotheses, a typical question 
asked is whether children take their listener's 
"perspective" into account when planning their referring 
expressions. 6 Another question raised is whether children 
of certain ages can adequately make comparisons of the 
properties of referents and non-referents in order to 
formulate an adequate referring expression. This line of 
4However, neither corpus incorporated true spoken interaction. The SRI 
dialogues that were analyzed in depth were taken from a mixed commu- 
nication mode in which one, an "expert", typed instructions to a third 
party, who spoke them to an "apprentice", and typed the apprentice's 
spoken replies to the expert. The BBN "incremental simulation" 
dialogues involved only keyboard communication. 
5Similar approaches include those of Dore et al (1978), and Sinclair 
and Coulthard (1975). 
Shatz and Gelman (1973) showed they can do so (though not neces- 
sarily accurately (Asher 1979)) at a much earlier age than had been 
supposed. 
100 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 3-4, July-December 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
work is more relevant o the present concerns of charac- 
terizing the act of identification, but the subskills exam- 
ined are still too coarse for our needs. 
Previous research has thus provided many lessons, 
among them: 
? the need to compare (at least initially) modalities that 
are minimally different, 
? the need for repeatable methods for characterizing 
linguistic behavior at the pragmatics and discourse 
structure level, 
? the need to assess the adequacy of our theories, and 
? the need for couching explanations in computational 
terms. 
The present study addresses each of these needs. 
3 The Phenomena of Interest: Referent Identifi- 
cation 
One referential goal that is essential to the present 
communication task is to get the hearer to identify the 
object the speaker has in mind. I shall be using the term 
"identify" in a very narrow, though important and basic, 
sense - one that intimately involves perception. Thus, 
the analysis is not intended to be general; it applies only 
when the referents are perceptually accessible to the 
hearer, and when the hearer is intended to use perceptual 
means to pick them out. For the time being, I shall 
explicitly not be concerned with a hearer's mentally 
"identifying" some entity satisfying a description, or 
discovering a co-referring description, although these 
operations are certainly important aspects of processing 
many referring expressions. In the remainder of this 
section, properties of the referent identification act are 
examined, in part by contrasting it with other concepts 
that have previously entered into computational linguistic 
analyses of reference. 
Referent identification requires an agent and a 
description. The essence of the act is that the agent pick 
out the thing or things satisfying the description. The 
agent need not be the speaker of the description, and 
indeed, the description need not be communicated 
linguistically, or even communicated at all. A crucial 
component of referent identification is the act of percep- 
tually searching for something that satisfies the 
description. To determine which method(s) should be 
used in identifying the referent, the agent first requires 
some representation of the description per se. The 
description is decomposed by the hearer into a plan of 
action for identifying the referent. The intended and 
expected physical, sensory, and cognitive actions to be 
included in that plan may be signalled by the speaker's 
choice of predicates. For example, a speaker who utters, 
"the magnetic screwdriver, please", may expect and 
intend for the hearer to place various screwdrivers 
against some piece of iron to determine which is magnet- 
ic. Similarly, a speaker uttering the description "the 
three two-inch long salted green noodles" may expect 
and intend the hearer to count, look at, measure, and 
perhaps taste various objects. For their part, hearers 
decompose the noun phrase/description to discover that 
"green" is determinable by vision, "inch" by measuring, 
"salted" primarily by taste, "noodle" primarily by vision, 
and "three" by counting. Speakers know this is what 
hearers can do, and l~hus, using a model of the hearer's 
capabilities and the causal connections among people, 
their senses, and physical objects, design the referring 
expression D to suggest the actions needed to identify the 
referent. 
Speakers often not only plan for hearers to identify the 
referents of descriptions, but also communicate, in the 
Gricean way (1957), their intention that the hearers do 
so. This intention may not be explicitly signalled in the 
utterance, but rather have to be recognized by the hear- 
er. To respond appropriately, a hearer decides when 
identification is the intended act to perform in response 
to a description, what part this act will play in the speak- 
er's and hearer's plans, and when to perform the act. If 
perceptually identifying a referent is represented as an 
action in the speaker's plan, hearers could reason about it 
just as they do about any other act, thereby becoming 
able to infer the speaker's intentions behind, for example, 
indirect identification requests. 
3.1 A sketch of a definition of perceptual refer- 
ent identification 
Figure 1 presents a sketchy definition of the referent 
identification action, in which the description is formed 
from "a/the y such that D(y)". 7

Figure 1. The act of referent identification. 
7 This definition is not particularly illuminating, but it is not any vaguer 
than others in the literature, including Searle's (1969). The point of 
giving it is that if a definition can be given in this form (i.e., as an action 
characterizable in a dynamic logic), a plan-based analysis (see section 
7.5) applies. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 3-4, July-December 1984 101 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
The formula follows the usual axiomatization of 
actions in a dynamic logic: P z \[Act\]Q; that is, if P is 
true, after doing Act, Q holds. 
(1980) possible worlds semantics 
operator RESULT is taken to be 
action, and a formula, iff in all 
from the agent's performing that 
true. 8 
Following Moore's 
for action, the modal 
true of an agent, an 
world states resulting 
action, the formula is 
The antecedent says there exists some (perhaps more 
than one) object satisfying three conditions. The first is 
a "perceptual accessibility" condition to guarantee that 
the IDENTITY-REFERENT action is applicable. This 
should guarantee that, for example, a speaker does not 
intend someone to pick out the referent of "3", 
"democracy", or "the first man to land on Mars". The 
condition is satisfied in the experimental task because it 
rapidly becomes mutual knowledge that the task requires 
communication about the objects in front of the hearer. 
The second condition states that X fulfills the 
description D. Here, I am ignoring cases in which the 
description is not literally true of the intended referent, 
including metonymy, irony, and the like (but see Perrault 
and Cohen 1981). Finally, D should be a description 
that is identifiable to this particular Agt. It should use 
descriptors whose extension the agent already knows or 
can discover by action. I am assuming that we can know 
that a combination of descriptors is identifiable without 
having formed a plan for identifying the referent. 
If the antecedent is true, then the agent picks out 
something (not necessarily the object satisfying the ante- 
cedent) as the referent of D. His picking out the "right" 
(i.e., the intended) object is handled by a separate char- 
acterization of the speaker's intention with respect o this 
action (see section 7.5). Here, I will merely give a name 
to the state of knowledge the agent is in after having 
identified the referent of D - (IDENTIFIED-REFERENT 
Agt D X). That is, Agt has identified the referent of D to 
be X. Of course, what has been notoriously difficult to 
specify is just what Agt has to know about X to say he 
has identified it as the referent of D. Clearly, "knowing 
who the D is" (Hintikka 1969, Moore 1980) is no substi- 
tute for having identified a referent. After having picked 
out the referent of a description, we may still not not 
know who the D is. On the other hand, we may know 
who or what the description denotes, for example, by 
knowing some "standard name" for it, and yet be unable 
to use that knowledge to pick out the object. For exam- 
ple, if we ask "Which is the Seattle train?" and receive 
the reply "It 's train number 11689", we may still not be 
able to pick out and board the train if its serial number is 
not plainly in view. Clearly, the notion of identification 
needs to be made relative to a purpose, which perhaps 
could be derived from the bodily actions that Agt is 
intended to perform upon the intended referent. 9 
Finally, although not stated in this definition, the 
means by which the act is performed is some function 
mapping D to some plan or procedure that, when 
executed by Agt, enables Agt to discover the X that is the 
referent of D. 
Even with this imprecise understanding of referent 
identification, it is apparent hat not all noun phrases 
used in task-oriented conversations (even with the 
perceptual access conditions satisfied) are uttered with 
the intention that their referents be identified. For exam- 
ple, in dialogues with an information booth clerk in a 
train station (Allen 1979, Horrigan 1977), patrons utter- 
ing "the 3:15 to Montreal?" are not intending the clerk 
to pick out the train. Instead, as part of their plan for 
boarding a train, patrons are intending the clerk to supply 
them with a co-referring noun phrase that will allow them 
to identify the train. The attributive use of definite noun 
phrases (Donnellan 1960) is another case in which the 
speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a refer- 
ent. Other non-anaphoric uses of noun phrases include 
labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommuni- 
cation, getting the speaker to wait while the speaker 
identifies the referent, etc. 1? 
3.2 Comparisons with computational linguistics 
approaches to reference 
Computational inguistics research has usually been 
concerned with co-reference - the relationship of words 
and symbols to other words and symbols. Typically, 
referents of descriptions are determined by intersecting 
the extensions of the predicates in the description, 
subject o the quantificational constraints imposed by the 
determiner. Although perhaps adequate for interfacing 
with databases, this approach presupposes that the exten- 
sions can be computed from information currently in the 
database. However, in interpreting and generating 
discourse about some physical task, the system may have 
to form a plan that it or its user perform physical actions 
to determine the extensions of the predicates. 
Five approaches are most closely related to ours. First, 
Winograd's SHRDLU (1972) attempted to simulate true 
reference with co-reference, at SHRDLU had a PLANNER 
function, THFIND, that could find objects in the database 
satisfying THGOAL statements as a simulation of finding 
8 Actually, Moore characterizes RESULT as taking an event and a 
formula as arguments. In his framework, an agent's doing an action 
denotes an event. However, this difference is not critical for what 
follows. 
The connection with the contextually relevant actions is a matter of 
inference (see section 6). 
~0 For other discussion of speakers' goals in uttering noun phrases (see 
Sidner (1983) and Wilkes-Gibbs, unpublished ms). 
Ii On the other hand, one might argue that SHRDLU engaged in true 
reference because the discourse was about non-existing blocks 
"contained" within the system. To pursue the truth of the matter would 
take us too far afield. 
102 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
blocks in the real world. THFIND was included in the 
semantic representation f definite NPs, and in the repre- 
sentation of indefinite NPs when those NPs were embed- 
ded in an action verb. However, THFIND is not 
attributed as a user goal, nor is it reasoned about (other 
than to maintain a distinction between definite and indef- 
inite NPs). Furthermore, it is not treated in the same way 
as acts such as PICKUP, whose execution is marked 
specially so that the system can later answer "why" ques- 
tions. 
Second, Allen's (1979) system used an IDENTIFY 
state in the control part of the plan-recognition mech- 
anism. Again, for this system, identification meant to 
find something in the database satisfying the requisite 
predicates. However, the IDENTIFY action itself was not 
part of the plan being recognized. The system did not 
reason about when IDENTIFY should be done (it always 
tried to IDENTIFY referents), nor did it attribute 
IDENTIFY to be part of its user's plan. 
The TDUS system (Robinson et al 1980) engaged in a 
dialogue about the assembly of an air compressor that, it 
was understood, was being assembled by an apprentice. 
Thus, the referents of the system's noun phrases were 
perceptually accessible to the hearer. The system was 
primarily oriented towards utterance interpretation, but it 
did generate responses to questions. In doing so, the 
system was in the same circumstances as the experts in 
the present study. However, because it was assumed that 
the extensions of all of the system's descriptors were 
already known to the hearer, the system did not reason 
that it should choose particular eferring expressions o 
that the hearer could pick out their referents. Instead, 
the choice of referring expressions was constrained by 
uniqueness and focus (Grosz 1977), constraints that are 
not considered here but are clearly necessary. Although 
TDUS employed the concept of locating an object in its 
representation of successful task performance, this 
concept did not play a role in choosing referring 
expressions unless the system was asked a question about 
an object's location. 
Appelt's KAMP system (1981) generalized TDUS to 
plan referring actions as part of the planning of illocu- 
tionary acts. However, KAMP would only include 
descriptors in a referring expression for which it was 
already mutually believed that the hearer knew the refer- 
ent. Thus, it could not generate referring expressions to 
new objects for the hearer to pick out. Furthermore, as 
argued earlier, the concept of "knowing what the refer- 
ent is", which was central to KAMP's planning of refer- 
ring phrases, is too strong to be an accurate 
representation f referent identification. 
Finally, the HAM-ANS question-answering system 
(Hoeppner, Morik, and Marburger 1984) generates 
descriptions of objects in a hotel room from visually 
derived information, assuming the user's visual search 
processes are identical with its own. In another applica- 
tion, the system answers questions about traffic flow 
based on visual data. In its tying reference to perception, 
the HAM-AN_S System has some of the flexibility that I 
am advocating. However, as with the others, it does not 
reason about identification as an action that the speaker 
intends it to do. In this paper, 1 argue why such reason- 
ing is needed. 
3.3 Summary  
In summary, I am suggesting that referent identification 
be an action that the hearer infers to be part of the 
speaker's plan, and that speakers plan for hearers to 
perform. To ensure that hearers can do so, speakers 
employ their knowledge of the hearer's perceptual abili- 
ties, and choose descriptions that will make use of those 
abilities. The ability to reason about the referent identifi- 
cation act will allow the hearer to infer the intentions 
behind many utterances that secure reference separately 
from predication, and do so indirectly. With this concept 
in mind, we can proceed to examine its use in discourse. 
4 The  Study  
Twenty-five subjects ("experts") each instructed a 
randomly chosen "apprentice" in assembling a toy water 
pump, following Grosz's (1977) and Chapanis et al's 
(1972) task-oriented dialogue paradigm. 12 
Subjects were paid volunteer students from the 
University of Illinois, all of whom were familiar with CRT 
terminals. Five "dialogues" took place in each of the 
following modalities: face-to-face, by telephone, 
keyboard ("linked" CRTs), (noninteractive) audiotape, 
and (non-interactive) written. In all modes, the appren- 
tices were videotaped as they followed the experts' 
instructions. 
Face-to-face and written modalities are the ones usual- 
ly compared in oral/written discussions. However, they 
differ along many dimensions (Rubin 1980). Pairwise 
comparisons of the modalities in this study can determine 
the effects of mutual vision, interaction, and the use of 
voice or print. Telephone and keyboard dialogues are 
analyzed first because our conclusions would indicate the 
effects of having a voice channel, and moreover would 
have implications for the design of speech understanding 
and production systems. These modalities take'on inter- 
mediate values in Rubin's dimensional space: the conver- 
sants share the same time frame, can interact, cannot see 
each other, and are conversing about objects mutually 
known to be physically present o one of them. 
Each expert participated in the experiment on two 
consecutive days, the first for training and the second for 
instructing an apprentice. Subjects playing the expert 
role were trained by following a set of assembly 
directions consisting entirely of imperatives, assembling 
,2 An exploded parts diagram of the pump can be found in Appendix A.

Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
the pump as often as desired, and then instructing a 
research assistant. This practice session took place face 
to face. Experts knew that the research assistant already 
knew how to assemble the pump. Experts were given an 
initial statement of the purpose of the experiment, which 
indicated that communication would take place in one of 
a number of different modes. Experts were not informed 
of the modality in which they would communicate until 
the next day. t3 
Apprentices were told the purpose of the experiment 
was to analyze the communicating of a set of instructions 
in different modalities. They were not initially informed 
that they were engaged in an assembly task. 
In both modes, experts and apprentices were located in 
different rooms. Experts had a set of pump parts that, 
they were told, were not to be assembled but could be 
manipulated. In Telephone mode, experts communicated 
through a standard telephone and apprentices communi- 
cated through a speaker-phone. This device did not need 
to be held and allowed simultaneous two-way communi- 
cation. Distortion of the expert's voice was apparent, but 
not measured. 
Subjects in "keyboard" mode typed their communi- 
cation on Elite Datamedia 1500 CRT terminals connected 
by the Telenet computer network to a computer at Bolt 
Beranek and Newman Inc. The terminals were "linked" 
so that whatever was typed on one would appear on the 
other. Simultaneous typing was possible and did occur. 
Subjects were informed that their typing would not 
appear simultaneously on either terminal. Response 
times averaged 1 to 2 seconds, with occasionally longer 
delays due to system load. 
4.1 Sample transcripts 
The following are representative samples of transcripts in 
the two modalities.

4.2 Method of analysis 
Discourses are analyzed for many reasons, with a corre- 
sponding variety of methods. Some analyses of discourse 
strive to explain what the text itself meant. Recent work 
on discourse pragmatics emphasizes the need to explain 
what the speaker meant in producing the utterances, i.e., 
what were the speaker's intentions? To build dialogue 
systems, we need to devise first theories and then algo- 
rithms for deriving what the speaker meant as a function 
of what was said and of contextual factors. The logical 
first step toward such a formalization is to establish reli- 
able methods for isolating the words, context, and speak- 
er intent. Each of these aspects of the discourse is 
considered below. 
104 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
First, the typewritten transcript of a verbal interaction 
provides reasonably accurate data on what was said, 
provided one's goal is not to study prosody. Second, 
contextual factors can be modelled in a setting in which 
the objects, communication task, and modality have been 
selected by the experimenter. The conversants' know- 
ledge of the domain is somewhat constrained by the 
experimental setup and the initial instructions. This 
semi-controlled nvironment can enable the experimenter 
to model the participants' initial experiment-induced 
beliefs, intentions, and expectations, which constitute our 
model of the cognitive ffects of context. 
Finally, as the conversation progresses, one needs 
interpretations of what each speaker meant, stated in 
terms of further attributions of beliefs and intentions. 
Standard empirical methods hould be used to minimize 
experimenter bias in making such attributions. In partic- 
ular, the theorist must be careful not to be the source of 
belief/intent attributions, for if given the leeway, he will 
undoubtedly find what he is looking for. To avoid this 
problem, I trained two people to employ a vocabulary for 
describing intentions in discourse, the so-called 
"illocutionary acts" (or, loosely, "speech acts") (Austin 
1962, Searle 1969). That is, the discourse analysts 
"code" the speaker's intentions in making an utterance 
by assigning illocutionary act labels to utterances (or 
groups of them). Fortunately, the illocutionary act 
vocabulary is the natural one in our common-sense 
psychology for making such attributions. However, 
unlike most theories of illocutionary acts, I do not claim 
that the conversants themselves attempt to determine 
what illocutionary acts were performed, although they 
might be able to do so if requested. 14The illocutionary 
act interpretations are therefore our interpretations, as 
coders and as theorists. 
The data that need to be compared and explained are 
these illocutionary act codings. As mentioned earlier, a 
number of researchers have attempted similar analyses, 
but are content with solely identifying regularities in their 
discourses. A preferable analysis would derive regulari- 
ties from more basic principles. The method employed 
here for formulating such derivations includes the follow- 
ing components: 
? A logic of beliefs, mutual beliefs, and goals. 
? A specification of the goals achieved by utterances of 
various forms (e.g., a yes/no question is an attempt o 
get the hearer to inform the speaker whether or not 
the proposition in question is true). 
? A formal theory of rational, intentional action that 
specifies how an agent's actions are determined by 
both his goals and his knowledge of the effects of, 
~4 See Cohen and Levesque (1980, in preparation) for a plan-based 
theory of communication that does not require the recognition of illocu- 
tionary acts. 
preconditions for, and means of accomplishing various 
action types. 
The aim of a competence theory of communication 
based on plans is to specify the set of possible plans 
underlying the appropriate use of various illocutionary 
acts. In applying such a theory to the analysis of 
discourse, plans are used to connect an utterance's form 
and content with the observers' illocutionary act coding, 
which is our best approximation to the speaker's intent. 
It is important to remember that these intentions may not 
be identical to those conveyed by the literal utterance. 
The plans make use of a formalization of the exper- 
imental task, the modality and the prior discourse, 
expressed in terms of the participants' mutual beliefs, 
goals, expectations, and possibilities for action. Thus, the 
theory captures, albeit in an indirect way, the depend- 
ence of the discourse structure on the experimental task 
and communication modality. 
In addition, a performance model would include algo- 
rithms for forming and recognizing plans of action to 
derive the observer's intent codings. Although such 
models have been built (Allen 1979, Brachman et al 
1979), I do not discuss them further here. 
In summary, the discourse analysis methodology is as 
follows: 
? Train coders to identify various illocutionary acts 
(IAS). 
? Compare the distribution of IAs across modalities. 
? Independently, characterize those IA types in terms of 
plans. 
? Formally derive the IA codings as a rational strategy of 
action, given attributions of the participants' beliefs, 
goals, and expectations at the point in the discourse in 
which the IAs occurred. 
When our work is complete, we will have analyses of the 
differences in achievement of the same overarching set of 
goals (the assembly task) as a function of modality. 
4.2.1 Coding the transcripts 
The first stage of discourse analysis involves the coding 
of the communicator's intent in making various utter- 
ances. Following the experiences of Sinclair and Coul- 
thard (1975), Dore et al (1978), and Mann, Carlisle, 
Moore, and Levin (1977), a coding scheme was devel- 
oped and two people were trained in its use. The coders 
relied on written transcripts, audiotapes, and on vide- 
otapes. 
The scheme, which was tested and revised on pilot 
data until reliability was attained, included a set of 
approximately eight illocutionary act categories that were 
used to label intent, and a set of "operators" and prop- 
ositions that were used to describe the assembly task, as 
in Sacerdoti (1975). Appendix B lists the propositions 
and operators for the physical actions. For example, 
putting two hollow, pipe-like pieces together was termed 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 105 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the iodal i ty  of Communication 
CONNECTing; putting a part with a protrusion into a part 
with a hole was termed MESHing. The operators for 
physical actions often served as the propositional content 
of the communicative acts. 
The following illocutionary act categories were coded: 
Communicative Act 
Example 
Request(Assembly Action) 
"But that on the hole" 
Request(Orientation Action) 
"the other way around" 
"the top is the bottom'" 
Request(Pick-up) 
"take the blue base" 
Request(Identify-Referent) 
"there is a little yellow piece of rubber'" 
Request(Informif(\[relation\])) 
"and you've got the base on it?" 
Request (Informif(Identified-referent)) 
"got it?" 
"'the little red plug?" 
Request(Achieve(\[relation\])) 
"and the purpose of  that is to cover up that hole .... 
\[relation\] = (Cover V2 Hole(TB)))\] 
Label 
"'that's a plunger" 
As discussed earlier, the action of referent identifica- 
tion is labelled IDENTIFY-REFERENT, and the state of 
affairs resulting from i t  is termed IDENTIFIED- 
REFERENT. Communicating that the speaker wants, the 
hearer to do something is termed REQUESTing. Yes/no 
questions are REQUESTs to get a hearer to perform an 
INFORMIF action, i.e., to tell the speaker whether or not 
some proposition holds. One subcase of this is to tell the 
hearer whether or not a referent for a description has 
been identified. Finally, speakers often request that 
hearers make a relation true, without specifying an action 
that would do so. This is cap\[ured by the REQUEST to 
ACHIEVE \[relation\] coding. 
Regarding referent identification, the coders were 
asked to state which utterances, or groups of utterances, 
constituted either an explicit request by the speaker that 
the hearer identify the referent of a noun phrase or a 
question about whether or not the hearer had done so. 
The coders were instructed not to consider whether or 
not an utterance was an indirect request o pick some- 
thing up (but see section 6.4.1). Furthermore, they were 
told not to consider noun phrases in assembly requests as 
identification requests unless identification was somehow 
"explicitly marked". 15 Because agreement about the 
intent behind utterance parts was not obtainable, I
cannot assert, on the basis of empirical evidence alone, 
that noun phrases embedded in imperatives are requests 
to identify the referents. Instead, the speaker's intent 
behind whole utterances (though not necessarily 
complete sentences) was coded, t6 
4.2.2 Mechanics of coding 
Of course, a coding scheme must not only capture the 
domain of discourse, it must be tailored to the nature of 
discourse per se. Many theorists have observed that a 
speaker can use a number of utterances to achieve a goal, 
and can use one utterance to achieve a number of goals. 
Correspondingly, the coders could consider utterances as 
jointly achieving one intention (by "bracketing" them), 
could place an utterance in multiple categories, and could 
attribute more than one intention to the same utterance 
or utterance part. The coders were instructed to ignore 
false starts, even though a false start may communicate 
information. 
Although our goals did not include a precise analysis 
of how prosody reflects speaker-intent and meaning, 
some decisions about bow to translate prosody into 
orthographic form, which undoubtedly influence subse- 
quent discourse analyses, were made by the transcriber 
of the audiotapes. To minimize inconsistencies in tran- 
scription, all transcriptions were checked by a second 
party. Moreover, it was discovered that the physical 
layout of a transcript, particularly the location of line 
breaks, affected which utterances were coded. To ensure 
uniformity, each coder first divided each transcript into 
utterances that he or she would code. These joint 
"bracketings" were compared to yield a base set of coda- 
ble utterance parts. The coders could later bracket utter- 
ances differently if necessary. 
For one third of the transcripts, interrater eliabilities 
were calculated within each mode, for each category. 
The measure consisted of twice the number of agree- 
ments divided by the number of times that category was 
coded (cf. Mann, Carlisle, Moore, and Levin 1977). 
Reliabilities were high (above 88%). Because ach disa- 
greement counted twice (against both categories that 
were coded), agreements also counted twice. 
4.2.3 Coding the sample dialogue fragments 
The previous fragments are coded below to indicate some 
of the complexities of the data as well as the scoring 
scheme. A number of shortcuts have been taken for 
expository purposes. First, if an act is stated as 
~ The above Telephone dialogue fragment contains one such intona- 
tionally marked noun phrase. 
t6 For a formal analysis that does make such a claim, see section 8.4 and 
Cohen (1984). 
~7 The action-effect relation holding between the various propositions 
and assembly actions can be readily inferred from Appendix B. 
106 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
COMPLETE, then the proposition stated as the effect of 
that act holds. 17 Second, some of the arguments to the 
embedded propositions have not been presented when 
those arguments are not problematic. Third, as argued 
above, the second argument of IDENTIFY-REFERENT 
should be a description in some appropriate logical form 
representing the meaning of the speaker's noun phrase. 
However, because it was too difficult to get coders to 
determine logical forms for the noun phrases, they 
instead coded only the canonical names of the referents 
as arguments. Finally, the elapsed time between utter- 
ances is not shown here, but is available from the vide- 
otapes. 
The codings of S's first turn indicate an attempt o 
achieve more than one intention in one utterance. 
Specifically, the form "there's a ...", is a typical way to 
perform a request to identify something satisfying the 
description (the "..."). In this case, the speaker said 
"thing", and labelled that thing a plunger. Whereas the 
labelling act may be finished, the request for referent 
identification apparently is not, and is continued over a 
number of utterances. 
The other "bracketed" turn is an example of a speak- 
er's prosodically achieving multiple goals at once. Here, 
the use of rising intonation in the middle of an imperative 
is used to check whether the hearer knows what the 
speaker is talking about. The pragmatics of this 
discourse situation led to the coding of "knowing what 
the speaker is talking about" as a request o physically 
identify a referent. Finally, notice the subsequent use of 
a questioned noun phrase fragment o perform the same 
act. The use of fragments will be discussed further 
below. 
The coding of the Keyboard utterances is more 
straightforward. There are three strategies of instruction 
here. First, direct requests for assembly actions, in the 
form of imperatives, as in line (1). Second, there are 
conjoined direct requests, for picking up followed by an 
assembly action, as in (12). Finally, B performs eparate 
identification requests, as in (7) and (8). 
What is important o notice here is that B shifts his 
strategy (in a fashion that resembles driving a three- 
speed car). Before this fragment, the conversation had 
proceeded smoothly, in "high gear", with B initially 
"upshifting" from first a "take and assemble" request o 
six consecutive assembly requests (one of them indirect), 
the last of which is utterance (1) of this fragment. 
In (5)-(7), we observe clarification dialogue about a 
noun phrase. Immediately after an apparent breakdown 
at (3), B "downshifts" to questioning the achievement of
his first subgoal, identifying the red piece. Once that is 
corrected, B stays in "low gear", explicitly ensuring 
success of his reference, in (8), before requesting an 
assembly action in (9). After that success, he "upshifts" 
to "second gear" - with requests to pick-up and assemble 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
in (13). After being successful yet again, B "upshifts" to 
"high gear", using direct assembly requests, for the rest 
of the dialogue (seven more requests). 
What could explain this conversation pattern? A 
common sense analysis of the plan for assembling would 
indicate that to install a piece, one must be holding it; to 
hold it, one must pick it up; to perform any action on an 
object, one must have identified that object. By request- 
ing an assembly action ("high gear"), one requires the 
listener to infer the rest of the plan. By requesting the 
sequence take-and-assemble ("second gear"), the speak- 
er makes one of the inferences himself, but requires the 
listener to realize that identification of the speaker's part 
description is needed. Finally, "low gear" involves the 
speaker's checking the success of the component 
subgoals, which involves identifying the referents of the 
speaker's descriptions. In summary, the strategy shift to 
"low gear" occurs after a referential miscommunication 
because it affords a more precise monitoring of the 
listener's achievement of the speaker's goals. The ques- 
tion to be asked is how, if at all, the use of identification 
requests differs across modes of communication. 
5 Results 
5.1 Analysis 1: Distribution of requests 
Because most of each dialogue consists of the making of 
requests, the first analysis examined the frequency of the 
various kinds of requests in the corpus of five transcripts 
for each modality. Table 1 displays the findings. 
Identification requests, which include questions about 
whether a referent has been identified, are much more 
frequent in Telephone dialogues than in Keyboard 
conversations. In fact, they constitute the largest catego- 
ry of requests in the former. Because orientation 
requests, pick-up requests, and other requests are often 
issued to clarify or follow up on a previous request, it is 
not surprising that they would increase in number 
(though not as a percentage) with the increase in the use 
of identification requests. Furthermore, it is sensible that 
there are about the same number of requests for assem- 
bly actions (and hence half the percentage) in each mode 
because the same "assembly work" is accomplished. 
Therefore, identification requests eem to be the primary 
request differentiating the two modalities. 18 Notice also 
that Chapanis et al's finding of twice as many words 
used in spoken over written modes holds true when we 
consider the number of requests rather than just words. 
t8 The only cases of unreliable coding resulted from attempts ocode 
identification requests when they were not obviously separate utter- 
ances. Most of these unreliable cases were found in the Keyboard 
dialogues, but were included in the totals for that modality. Thus, using 
a strict criterion of counting only reliable xamples of identification 
requests, the differences between the two modes are even stronger than 
shown i~ the table.

Although frequency data are important for computational 
linguistics, they supply only a coarse description of 
discourse phenomena and the dialogue itself. For assess- 
ing the importance of a phenomenon, it is important o 
discover the context in which it occurs. In our case, the 
question arises whether the frequent use of identification 
requests is a function of the modality itself or a function 
of the dynamics of the discourse (or both). For example, 
identification requests might arise primarily after referen- 
tial miscommunication, as in the above Keyboard 
dialogue. If they did, one might argue that people would 
speak more carefully to machines than they do to people, 
leading to less miscommunication a d therefore a smaller 
frequency of identification requests than we found. 
Consequently, the argument hat identification requests 
are important for computational linguistics research 
would be weakened. However, Fertig (unpublished) 
found no significant differences in the frequency of 
miscommunication across modes. The observed modality 
differences in the use of identification requests are there- 
fore due to other causes. 
To determine if the frequent use of identification 
requests holds across subjects within modes, a second 
analysis of the utterance codings was undertaken that 
was limited to "first-time" identifications - that is, how 
objects were first introduced to hearers. Each time a 
novice first identified a piece in response to a communi- 
cative act, that act was noted. Furthermore, that act was 
counted only if it was not preceded by another mention- 
ing the same part prior to the novice's identification 
attempt. This analysis therefore xamines only requests 
used to make first effective reference to an object. Table 
2 indicates the results for each subject in Telephone and 
Keyboard modes. 
Subjects were classified as habitual users of a commu- 
nicative act if, out of 12 pieces, the subject "introduced" 
at least 9 of the pieces with that act. In Telephone mode,

four of five experts were habitual users of identification 
requests to get the apprentice to find a piece. The 
remaining subject used the strategy of first requesting the 
apprentice to pick up a part, and then requesting that it 
be attached to the pump. In Keyboard mode, no experts 
were habitual users of identification requests. However, 
three experts were habitual users of assembly requests in 
getting apprentices to identify objects. 
To show a "modality effect" in the making of first 
effective reference, the number of habitual users of each 
request type in each mode was subjected to Fischer's 
exact probability test. This calculates the probability that 
differences in the number of habitual and nonusers of a 
particular reference strategy in different modes could 
have happened by chance. Even with five subjects per 
mode, differences in the use of identification requests 
across modes were significant (p = 0.023), indicating 
that Telephone conversation per se differs from 
Keyboard conversation i  the ways in which a speaker 
will first get a hearer to identify an object. 
In summary, it has been shown that Telephone and 
Keyboard modes differ primarily in the use of explicit 
identification requests. These requests do not simply 
occur after referential miscommunication (as they do in 
Keyboard), but are used to first introduce objects. The 
experts then often question the apprentices about 
successful completion of the identification act (just as 
they do assembly acts). Experts using keyboards do not 
attempt o achieve referential goals explicitly. Instead, 
referential goals are subsumed in assembly requests. 
Voice communication is thus "finer-grained" than 
keyboard communication.

These results are similar to observations by Ochs and 
colleagues (Ochs 1979; Ochs, Schieffelin, and Pratt 
1979). Using evidence from transcripts, they point out 
that caretaker-child and child-child discourse often 
consists of "sequential" constructions - with separate 
utterances for securing reference and for predicating. 
Ochs et al suggest that the presence of sequential

constructions i  tied to the possibility for preplanning an 
utterance. Relatively unplanned iscourse, it is claimed, 
relies on the pragmatic ontext o express propositions, 
where planned discourse would use syntactic means. 
Unplanned discourse results when speakers are concen- 
trating on a task or when the expression of a concept is 
particularly difficult. The present study upholds Och et 
al.'s claim for Telephone and Keyboard communication, 
but does not do so for the Written condition, in which 
many identification requests occur as separate steps 
(Tierney et al 1983). Furthermore, Ochs et al's claim 
does not account for the use of identification requests in 
Keyboard modality after prior referential miscommuni- 
cation (see section 4.1 for a sample conversation), indi- 
cating that sequential constructions can result from (what 
they term) planned as well as unplanned iscourse. 
Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (unpublished) analyze refer- 
ential communication data similar to ours. Their concern 
is to show that referring is a collaborative process, one 
that proceeds by a speaker's proposing a referring 
expression, and a hearer's accepting or rejecting it as 
adequate for identifying the referent. Among the speak- 
er's strategies for securing reference, they note elabo- 
rations (which I called "supplements"), trial proposals 
(Question-requests for identification), partial proposals, 
and others. Unlike what has occasionally been assumed 
in the referential communication literature, speakers are 
not regarded as trying to produce, in one turn, an effec- 
tive referring expression that is minimally long. Instead, 
they claim speakers attempt to minimize the collaborative 
effort of both parties. The discourses they analyzed 
overlap significantly in structure with those found here. 
The present account differs in that I give a formal analy- 
sis of the act of referring as an illocutionary act - an 
account hat allows for indirect performance. 
It is difficult to compare the present results with those 
of other studies. Chapanis et al's (1977) observation 
that voice modes are faster and wordier than keyword 
modes certainly holds here. However, their transcripts 
cannot easily be used to verify the present findings 
because, for the equipment assembly problem, their 
subjects were given a set of instructions that could be, 
and often were, read to the listener. Thus, utterance 
function would often be predetermined. Our subjects 
110 
had to remember the task and compose the instructions 
afresh. 
Stoll et. al.'s (1976) lexical analysis of the Chapanis 
data indicates that in verbal modalities ubjects produce 
many more pronouns and (what they term) "function 
words", which include articles, prepositions, modals, 
existential "there", etc. In the present study, there were 
at least two requests used for each assembly step in Tele- 
phone mode. Each pair of requests (identification 
requests followed by assembly requests, or requests to 
pick up followed by assembly requests) involved at least 
one common object being manipulated. In the assembly 
request, the speakers frequently referred to that object 
with a pronoun. Thus, because of the pragmatically fine- 
grained nature of Telephone mode, there are many more 
pronouns to to resolve. I suspect he same kind of analy- 
sis can be applied to Stoll et. al.'s "function word" cate- 
gory, although that category is so diverse that 
generalizations may be harder to find. However, it is 
clear that in the present data, the use of "existential 
there" sentences, by far the largest class of identification 
requests, is only a Telephone strategy. 
Modality differences in Grosz' (1977) study cannot be 
directly compared for the identification phenomena 
because the core dialogues that were analyzed in depth 
each employed both spoken and keyboard modalities. 
However, the present results would predict that indirect 
identification requests would not appear because the 
expert, who did most of the communicating, used a 
keyboard. 
Finally, Thompson's (1980) extensive tabulation of 
utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison over- 
laps the analysis in this paper at the level of syntax. Both 
Thompson's and the present study are primarily 
concerned with extending the usability of current systems 
by identifying phenomena that people use, but that 
would be problematic for computers. However, the two 
studies proceeded along different lines. Thompson's was 
more concerned with utterance forms and less with prag- 
matic function, whereas for this study, the concerns are 
reversed in priority. This study's concern stems from the 
observation that differences in utterance function will 
influence the processing of utterances with the same

6 Analysis of Utterance Forms: Identification 
Requests 
Thus far, explicit identification requests have been shown 
to be pervasive in Telephone mode. One might expect 
that, in analogous circumstances (i.e., with analogous 
goals and perceptual capabilities), a robot might be 
confronted with many of these acts. Computational 
linguistics research then must discover algorithms for 
determining an appropriate analysis and response, in part 
as a function of utterance form. To see just which forms 
are used for the task, utterances classified as identifica- 
tion requests in Telephone mode were tabulated. The 
full listing of identification requests can be found in 
Appendix C. 
Table 3 presents a classification of these utterances, 
along with an example of each class. The utterance 
forms are divided into four major groups, based on their 
similarities in either syntactic or logical form. The first 
group consists of utterances whose logical form is an 
existential proposition (usually determined by the pres- 
ence of an indefinite noun phrase). The second category 
includes those utterances that mention perceptual actions 
(e.g., "look") and perceptual effects (such as "see"), but 
are not syntactically imperatives. The third class contains 
identification requests performed with utterance frag- 
ments, usually noun or prepositional phrases (PPs). The 
concept of fragment is not solely a syntactic lassification 
- hearers can be requested prosodically to respond to 
NPs and PPs that are embedded in full sentences. Other 
categories of utterance forms for identification requests 
include what are "nearly direct" requests (i.e., imper- 
atives and utterances that explicitly mention searching for 
an object) and what are termed "Let's requests", which 
explicitly change the focus of attention to an object satis- 
fying the description. Finally, one class of utterances, 
accounting for 11% of identification requests and called 
"supplemental NP" (e.g., "Put that on the opening in the 
other large tube, with the round top"), was unreliably 
coded and not considered for the analyses below. Cate- 
gory labels followed by "(?)"  indicate that the utterances 
comprising those categories might also have been issued 
with rising intonation. Typically, such utterances were 
coded as questions and also as requests for identification. 
The important hing to notice in Table 3 is that in 
Telephone mode identification requests were almost never 
performed irectly. No speaker used direct forms, e.g., 
"Find the rubber ring shaped like an O", which occurred 
frequently in the Written modality (Tierney et al 1983). 
However, the use of indirection is selective - Telephone 
experts frequently use direct imperatives to perform 
assembly requests. Moreover, many speakers adopted a 
consistent style. For example, all the "nearly direct 
requests" came from one speaker, and another almost 
uniformly used the "there's a NP" strategy. 
Because explicit identification requests come in many 
syntactic forms, each of which has a literal interpretation 
that is not an identification request, the hearer needs 
some method for deciding what the speaker's intention(s) 
are. Ideally, such reasoning should be an application of 
more general reasoning about nonlinguistic actions. Of 
course, a suitable "compiling" strategy can specialize the 
general case for this task (cf. Brachman et al 1979). 
Below, I sketch such a theory and apply it to the exam- 
ples in Table 3. 
6.1 A sketch of a plan-based theory of communi- 
cation 
The unifying theme of much current pragmatics research 
is that the coherence of dialogue is to be found in the 
interaction of the conversants' plans. That is, a speaker 
is regarded as planning his utterances to achieve his 
goals, which may involve influencing a hearer. On 
receiving an utterance, the hearer attempts to infer the 
speaker's goal(s), and to understand how the. utterance 
furthers them. The hearer then adopts new goals (e.g., to 
respond to a request, to clarify the previous speaker's 
utterance or goal), and plans his own utterances to 
achieve those. A conversation ensues.

Recent work of this type (Allen 1979, Appelt 1981, 
Bruce 1983, Bruce and Newman 1978, Bruce and 
Schmidt, Cohen 1978, Cohen and Levesque 1980, 
Cohen and Perrault 1979, Perrault and Allen 1980, 
Schmidt 1975, Sidner and Israel 1981) has resulted in 
formal and computational models of communication that 
have been applied in analyzing dialogues about tasks and 
stories. The general features of the models include: a 
simple theory of action, definitions of various physical 
and communicative actions, a set of inference rules for 
formulating and recognizing plans of action, a formaliza- 
tion of agents' beliefs, goals, and expectations, and a 
mapping of utterance forms to the "surface speech 
actions" speakers are performing in making those utter- 
ances. 
For the purposes of this paper, planning is simplis- 
tically viewed as the process of finding an action (or a 
sequence of them) that will achieve the agent's goal(s) 
given what he believes to be the state of the world. 
Roughly speaking, to recognize an agent's plan in 
performing an action, observers deploy a theory of plan- 
ning "in reverse" to connect he observed action with a 
chain of inferences of the form "agent did X in order to 
achieve Y, which would enable him to do Z", terminating 
in (what they take to be) a likely or expected goal of the 
agent (Allen 1979; Genesereth 1978; Schmidt, Sridhar- 
an, and Goodson 1979; Wilensky 1978). Such reasoning 
employs beliefs about the agent's beliefs, conditions that 
are likely to be true at the end of an action, other actions 
that are enabled by those conditions, and expected plans 
and goals of that agent.

6.2 Ana lyz ing  indi rect  ident i f i cat ion  requests  
Perrault and Allen (1980) have proposed the following 
plan-recognition i ferences: 
? Action-effect: If the observer thinks the agent wants to 
do an action, the observer can posit that the agent 
wants that action done in order to achieve its typical 
effect. 
? Precondition-action: If the agent is thought to want 
some proposition P to be true, and P is the precondi- 
tion of an action known to the agent, consider that the 
agent's goal is to perform that action. 
? Body-action: If the agent is thought o have a goal that 
is the means by which a "higher level" action is 
performed, then consider that the agent is attempting 
to perform that action. 19 
? Knowif:  If the agent is thought to want to know 
whether or not some proposition P holds, then consid- 
er that the agent wants P to hold (or wants P to be 
false). 
The plan-recognition process first classifies utterances 
by their mood into so-called "surface speech acts": 
declaratives become instances of the S-INFORM act type, 
imperatives become S-REQUESTS, and questions become 
S-REQUESTS to INFORMIF or INFORMREF (for Yes /No 
and Wh questions, respectively). These surface acts are 
the prototypical ways to perform the corresponding illo- 
cutionary acts REQUEST, INFORM, and REQUEST to 
INFORMIF. 1? 
Grice (1957) has argued that a simple plan-recognition 
process, which an unseen observer might perform, cannot 
be the basis for communication. Rather, the hearer must 
infer and act on what the speaker wants him to think she 
wants. A plan-based theory proposes that such reason- 
ing is invoked by applying the independently motivated 
plan-recognition process to the observed communicative 
actions. Hearers are, in effect, asking themselves "Why 
did the speaker say that?" Subsequent reasoning, termed 
here intended plan recognition, derives other goals that the 
hearer thinks she or he was supposed to infer. The proc- 
ess of attributing oals to an agent is terminated when an 
inference path merges with a mutually expected goal of 
that agent. 
This plan-based approach as led to a first explanation 
of a large class of "indirect speech acts" - utterances 
whose surface form indicates one speaker intention, but 
for which additional intentions should be recognized. 
For example, although "Can you reach the hammer?" is 
literally a yes/no question, the speaker may have another 
goal - to get the hearer to pass the hammer to the speak- 
er. The essential insight of the theory is that indirect 
speech act recognition is a by-product of the general 
process of recognizing someone's plans. If illocutionary 
act identification occurs immediately after the expansion 
of a surface act, then a literal interpretation has been 
found. If there are intervening intended plan-recognition 
inferences, then an indirect interpretation has been 
inferred. 
6.3 Example  
The following example is intended to give a brief intro- 
duction to the reasoning underlying indirection. Details 
of this process can be found in (Allen and Perrault 1980, 
Perrault and Allen 1980). The utterance to be interpret- 
ed is, "'Can you reach the hammer?" The inferred prop- 
ositions are indicated in boldface; commentary on the 
inference process is indented. 
After parsing and semantic interpretation, the utter- 
ance is represented as a surface speech act: 
HBSW (S-REQUEST(S,H,INFORMIF(H,S, 
CANDO(H,REACH(H, HAMMER))))) 
That is, the Hearer Believes the Speaker Wanted 
to perform (what appears to be) a yes-no ques- 
tion about his ability to reach the hammer. 
The effect of an S-REQUESTS to do action ACT 
is simply that the hearer believes the speaker 
wants the hearer to do ACT. Thus, applying the 
action-effect inference to the S-REQUESTS act, 
yields: 
HBSW(HBSW(KNOWIF(S, 
CANDO(H,REACH(H,HAMMER))))) 
The first level of "HBSW" comes from assuming 
the speaker's action was intentional. The second 
level is derived from the effect of the surface 
speech act. Now, intended plan recognition 
involves deriving new formulas of the form 
HBSW(HBSW(G)), i.e., the Hearer Believes the 
Speaker Wants him to think the speaker's goal is 
G. Any goals G'  derived with the prefix 
HBSW(HBSW) are taken to have been communi- 
cated (in the Gricean sense). The truth of the 
preconditions to the actions that are inserted into 
the (intended) plan being recognized are evalu- 
ated with respect o the mutual beliefs of speaker 
and hearer. 
The two outer levels of "HBSW" are assumed to 
embed all the following formulas. In particular, 
applying the knowif inference at this level of 
embedding, the hearer ealizes the speaker wants 
to knowif P (i.e., to know whether or not H can 
reach the hammer) because he wants him to be 
able to reach the hammer, yielding 
~9 Note that this inference can adversely affect he combinatorics of the 
plan-recognition process. 
z0 Levesque and I (in preparation) demonstrate how the intentions 
underlying these indirect speech act analyses can be derived using the 
surface speech acts and plan-recognition inferences, but not Perrault 
and Allen's illocutionary acts. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 113 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
CANDO(H,REACH(H,HAMMER)) 
CANDO(H,ACT) is true when the preconditions 
of ACT are true, and the speaker wants the prec- 
onditions to be true because he wants the act 
done: 
REACH(H,HAMMER) 
S wants the act done for its effect: 
HAVE(H,HAMMER) 
S wants the effect because it enables another 
act: 
PASS(H,S,HAMMER) 
Finally, because the embedded HBSW(PASS...) is 
a way of performing a request to pass the 
hammer, the body-action inference yields: 
HBSW (REQUEST(S,H,(PASS(H,S,HAMMER)))) 
Of course, the procedure could also have derived 
a request o reach the hammer. It does not do so 
because of the "level-of-inference" heuristic that 
pursues inference paths at the HBSW(HBSW) 
level of embedding before those with just the 
HBSW level of embedding. Applying the action- 
effect inference to the REQUEST action, and 
collapsing a few uninteresting inferences, H 
infers: 
HBSW(PASS(H,S, HAMMER)) 
Then, H arrives at: 
HBSW(HAVE(S,HAMMER)) 
Because the speaker's having the hammer was 
(assumed to be) an expected goal, the inference 
process tops. 
To summarize, the plan-based theory views speech 
actions as planned actions that can be reasoned about in 
the same ways as physical actions. Indirect speech act 
interpretation involves linking the surface speech act 
characterizing each utterance with some expected goal 
through a chain of means-ends reasoning. When applied 
to a discourse, the plan-based theory attempts to mediate 
between utterance form and a (potentially changing) set 
of beliefs, goals, and expectations. 
6.4 App ly ing  the  theory  
Assume that syntactic and semantic components have 
already analyzed the utterances, resulting in a logical 
form for each sentence or complete constituent. Further- 
more, assume that the apprentice has inferred the follow- 
ing expectations about the expert's goals: "For each 
piece making up the pump: The expert gets the appren- 
tice to: identify the piece, pick it up, and perform some 
assembly action on it." Such expected goals can be used 
to terminate the process of plan recognition. Now, many 
of the utterance forms can be analyzed as requests for 
identification once an act for physically searching for the 
referent of a description has been posited. For conven- 
ience, the definition of IDENTIFY-REFERENT, from 
section 3.1, is repeated below: 
V D Agt 
3 X \[PERCEPTUALLY- 
ACCESSIBLE(X, Agt) & 
D(X) & 
IDENTIFIABLE(Agt,D)\] 
3 X \[RESULT(Agt, 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT(D), 
IDENTIFIED-REFERENT 
(Agt, D, X)\] 
Figure 4. The act of referent identification. 
6.4.1 Ex is tent ia l  p ropos i t ions  
The utterances in Class A can then be analyzed as 
requests for IDENTIFY-REFERENT by applying plan 
recognition to the definition of the surface speech acts. 
Class A includes all declarative utterances whose logical 
form is an existential proposition (3 X P(X)), which 
includes utterances of the form "there is a .... ", "you 
have a .... ", and "\[object\] has a .... \[part\]". These utter- 
ances would appear literally to be informative. However, 
they can be interpreted as requests that the hearer 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT of the description "the P" by 
reasoning that a speaker's wanting a hearer to believe 
that a precondition to an action (IDENTIFY-REFERENT) 
is true can communicate (in the Gricean way) that the 
speaker wants that action to be performed, provided the 
act's effect is mutually known to be an expected goal of 
the speaker's. 
For example, "it's got a peg in it" is represented as 3 x 
\[INSIDE(x, PLUNGER) & PEG(x)\]. Informing a hearer of 
this proposition yields sufficient conditions for inferring 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT (APPRENTICE, \[INSIDE(x, 
PLUNGER) & PEG(x)\]), whose effect unifies with a 
mutually expected goal. Thus, the existing indirection 
machinery can handle these cases. 21 
Yes/no questions can be recognized as requests for 
identification by the means of the same plan-recognition 
process. There are two cases. In one case, the hearer is 
modelled as inferring that the speaker wants the proposi- 
tion in question to be true because it enables ome action 
(i.e., IDENTIFY-REFERENT) to be performed that will 
yield a desired effect (IDENTIFIED-REFERENT). The 
inference takes hold because it is mutually believed that 
the speaker already knows the answer to his question. 
For example, in saying, "There's a little blue cap?" it is 
shared knowledge that the speaker already knows such a 
114 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
cap is in front of the hearer. Therefore, finding out 
whether there is such a cap could not be the speaker's 
goal. 22 In the second case, the hearer wants to know 
whether some proposition is true because he wants it to 
be true (or false), and wants the hearer to make it true 
(or false). In this way, questioning IDENTIFIED- 
REFERENT can be taken as a request for 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT.Z3, 24 
6.4.2 Percept ion -based  ut terances  
Plan recognition can also suggest how Class B utterances 
all convey requests for referent identification. In this 
class, ACT = LOOK-AT, EFFECT = AGENT SEE X. 
Because LOOK-AT is one of the constituent acts of 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT, Perrault and Allen's "body- 
action" inference, given a formalization of perceptual 
actions and their relation to searching, should make the 
necessary connection - the speaker wanted the hearer to 
LOOK-AT something as part of his IDENTIFY- 
REFERENT act. Specifically, Case 1 \["If you look, you 
will see..." (If you don't,  you won't)\]  again appears to be 
an informative utterance about a conditional. The speak- 
er's intent that the hearer actually look for  something is 
derived by an inference saying that if a speaker commu- 
nicates that an act will yield some desired effect, then one 
can infer that the speaker wants that act performed to 
achieve that effect. Case 2 ("Do you see X") is again 
indirect because the hearer can truthfully answer "No" if 
he is looking out the window. Again the appropriate 
2~ The formalism also predicts that, in this task, an indirect request to 
identify an object would also be an indirect request o pick up that 
object, because the line of inference isunambiguous and its end goal is 
mutually believed to be desired. If it were mutually believed that a 
possible nd goal of the inference path (e.g., that the apprentice be 
holding the piece) was not desired (because, for instance, the piece was 
known to be hot), then the hearer would not infer he was supposed to 
pick up the piece. Although the coders were not asked to make this 
distinction, further analysis ndicates the modality differences are stron- 
ger when pick-up requests are considered together with identification 
requests inAnalysis 2. In Telephone mode, all 5 subjects were habitual 
users of either identification or pick-up requests, whereas no subjects 
were habitual users of either of those request types in Keyboard mode. 
Differences across modes are significant (p = 0.004). 
22 "Do you have homework to do?" is similarly identified as a request 
that you do your homework. 
23 A similar inference occurs in recognizing "Is the garbage out?" as a 
request to take out the garbage. 
24 Occasionally, speakers appear to ask "real" questions. For example, 
after requesting the hearer to identify a part, a speaker asked, "Do you 
see that?" 1 would have coded this as a true question, and not as an 
identification request, because the goal of an identification request (the 
speaker's communicating hisintent hat the hearer identify the piece) 
has already been achieved. The interrogative, then, is truly a question 
about whether the part has been identified. The coders, however, were 
not asked to make this distinction. The formalism akes predictions 
concerning which utterances were identification requests and which 
were only questions; ince the codings did not reflect his difference, we 
have considered all questions to be identification requests. The number 
of cases of suspected true questions i small enough that the quantita- 
tive results are still valid. 
intention - that the hearer look for X - can be inferred 
by noticing that the speaker's questioning whether the 
desired effect of an act holds conveys the sense that the 
act itself is desired (e.g., "Is the garbage out?"). Case 3 
("You will see X")  is similar to Case 1, except that the 
relationship between the desired effect and the action 
yielding that effect is presumed. 
6.4.3 F ragments  
Group C utterances constitute the class of fragments 
classified as requests for identification. Case 1 includes 
NP fragments, often with rising intonation. The action to 
be performed is not explicitly stated, but must be 
supplied on the basis of shared knowledge about the 
discourse situation - who can do what, who can see 
what, what each participant hinks the other believes, 
what is expected, etc. 
Allen and Perrault's (1980) method of handling frag- 
ments involves unifying (in the technical sense of the 
term) the effects of the possible surface speech acts 
corresponding to the fragment with expected goals of the 
speaker. The result is a more fully specified goal that can, 
perhaps, be acted on. For questioned singular definite 
noun phrases (NP), their model proposes two possible 
incomplete surface speech acts: 
S-REQUEST(S,H,INFORMIF(H,S, ~ (ixNPx))), and 
S-REQUEST(S,H,INFORMREF(H,S, iy\[ ~b (ixNPx) = y\])). 
For example, on hearing "The Windsor train?" the 
system would initially take the speaker either to be 'asking 
a yes /no  question about some property ~ of the referent 
of "the Windsor train", or to be asking to know that the 
referent of the value of applying some function ~b to the 
referent of "the Windsor train". The respective ffects 
of these surface acts would involve the hearer's thinking 
the speaker's goal is to know whether or not that predi- 
cate ~ holds, or to know the identity of the referent of iy\[ 
~/ (ixNPx) = y\])). The appropriate predicates (~) and 
functions (~) need to be supplied from domain-depen- 
dent expectations. In the former case, the predicate ,~ 
might be (LAMBDA y (LEAVES-AT(y,4:40))), whereas in 
the latter case, the function ~k might be (LAMBDA y ( 
GATE(y))). 
Consider a questioned noun phrase, and just the 
yes /no  question interpretation. The next step, according 
to the theory, is to infer that (it is shared knowledge) that 
the speaker wants (the hearer to think) that the speaker's 
goal is that ,~ (iyNPy) be true. The properties ,~ needed 
to "fill in" such fragments come from mutually expected 
goals of the expert. The expected goal in question for 
this domain, which is (somehow) derived from the nature 
of the task as one of manual assembly, is 
(IDENTIFIED-REFERENT APPRENTICE D X), where D 
becomes bound to iyNPy, X names the referent, and ~ is 
IDENTIFIED-REFERENT. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 115 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
From this, the apprentice infers that he should make 
(IDENTIFY-REFERENT APPRENTICE iyNPy X) true. In 
the same way that questioning the completion of an 
action can convey a request for action, questioning 
IDENTIFIED-REFERENT conveys a request for 
IDENTIFY-REFERENT (see Case 2, Group B, above). 
Thus, by my positing an IDENTIFY-REFERENT act, and 
by my assuming that the effect of this act is expected, the 
inferential machinery can derive the appropriate inten- 
tion behind the use of a noun phrase fragment. 
Notice that "fragment" is not a simple syntactic lassi- 
fication. In Case 2 ("In the green thing at the bottom 
\[pause\] . . . .  Mmhm"), the speaker paralinguistically "calls 
for" a hearer esponse in the course of some linguistically 
complete utterance. Because of the nature of the task, 
Case 2 is coded as an identification request. A simple 
syntactic lassification of fragments would not consider 
this request as fragmentaryY 
This treatment of fragments i different from the usual 
one in computational linguistics, in which the fragment is 
matched into prior syntactic forms. Such an approach 
cannot work for fragments poken without prior linguis- 
tic context, nor for fragmented adverbials whose coher- 
ence depends on a prior system action. Allen and 
Perrault's approach is an attempt to access the user's goal 
without reconstructing either a full syntactic or semantic 
analysis. 
6.4.4 Nearly direct requests 
! 
Group D utterance forms are the closest forms to direct 
requests for identification that appeared, though strictly 
speaking, they are not direct requests. Case 1 ("Look at 
the bottom of the tube") mentions "Look at", but does 
not indicate a search explicitly. The interpretation of this 
utterance in Perrault and Allen's scheme would require 
an additional "body-action" inference to yield a request 
for identification. Case 2 ("The next thing you're gonna 
look for is...") is literally an informative utterance, 
though a request could be derived in one step. It is 
important that the frequency of these "nearest 
neighbors" is minimal (2%). 
6.4.5 "Let's" requests 
One speaker used "Let's" requests explicitly to shift the 
topic of conversation to one previously "closed" (Grosz 
1977), and in the process to get the hearer to re-identify 
an object. Whereas other identification requests hift the 
topic as a by-product, this request seems literally to be a 
topic shift, with identification as a by-product. 
6.5 Summary 
The act of explicitly requesting referent identification is
nearly always performed indirectly in Telephone mode. 
This being the case, inferential mechanisms are needed 
for uncovering the speaker's intentions from the variety 
of forms with which this act is performed. A plan-based 
theory of communication accounts for 69% of the iden- 
tification requests in the corpus \[class A (56%), class C1 
(12%), and class D2 (1%)\]. Furthermore, plan recogni- 
tion can infer the LOOK-AT action from the perception- 
based utterances \[class B (9%)\], but cannot yet connect 
LOOK-AT to IDENTIFY-REFERENT, because the means 
for performing IDENTIFY-REFERENT remains unspeci- 
fied. Class C2 (preposed or interior prepositional phras- 
es) requires a prosodic analysis to determine that a 
hearer esponse is called for and precisely what constitu- 
ent is in question. With such an analysis, Perrault and 
Allen's fragment analysis can employ expectations to 
respond appropriately. Finally, Class E ("Let's" 
requests) is problematic for this theory (but see Grosz 
1977). 
7. Alternative Explanations Countered 
I have argued that to interpret indirect identification 
requests, the apprentice needs to reason about the 
expert's intent. Alternative xplanations could be envi- 
sioned that would place the burden of noun phrase inter- 
pretation entirely on the hearer. According to such 
accounts, the hearer would act on a noun phrase as he 
pleased, independent of the speaker's intended use of 
that noun phrase. A succession of such explanations i
countered below. 
1. The hearer will identify the referent of every noun 
phrase. Clearly, for both definite and indefinite noun 
phrases, this explanation is inadequate. Noun phras- 
es such as "See the tapered red piece with the hole? 
That's the nozzle", and "We need a valve for that 
hole. It's the little yellow piece of rubber", supply 
functional descriptions or labels that cannot be iden- 
tified at the time of utterance. 26Rather, the speaker 
informs the hearer about some future function of that 
piece. 
2. The hearer identifies every description he can. For 
example, perhaps a hearer will identify all things 
described with color or shape terms, or all noun 
phrases with existential presuppositions. However, 
this is again too simplistic. A hearer will undoubt- 
edly not react to "there is a red cobra under that 
basket", by trying to identify the cobra because, in 
short, he doesn't want to. 
3. The hearer identifies every description he can identify 
and wants to identify. That is, the hearer would 
z5 Such examples of parallel achievement of communicative actions 
cannot be accounted for by any linguistic theory or computational 
linguistic mechanism of which I am aware. These cases have been 
included here because I believe that the theory should be extended to 
handle them by reasoning about parallel actions. 
~6 The IDENTIFIABLE precondition was posited to prevent such noun 
phrases from being identified. 
116 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
ignore what the speaker intends, and act on what he 
thinks is both feasible and desirable. To see that this 
cannot be the hearer's sole strategy, consider the 
following Telephone dialogue (and recall that the 
expert had a set of pieces in front of him, though the 
apprentice did not know this): 
Expert: Now, take the big blue stopper that's 
laying around and take the black ring..." 
Apprentice: \[Searches and repeats more slowly\] 
"the big blue stopper" 
Expert:"Yeah, the big blue stopper \[short pause\] and 
black ring." 
Although the apprentice could be said to be follow- 
ing the purported reference strategy in response to 
the expert's definite noun phrase, the same could not 
be said of the expert in responding to the same NP. 27 
The expert is obviously not intended by the appren- 
tice to identify the piece even though he could, 
because he has just requested the apprentice to do 
so, and because the expert's having a set of pieces 
was not mutually believed. The expert responds to 
(what he believes to be) the apprentice's purpose in 
repeating the NP, and not solely to his own desires 
and capabilities. 
According to the above argument, the hearer cannot 
be completely egocentric in his interpretation of noun 
phrases, but considers the speaker's intentions with 
respect to that noun phrase. 28 One might still argue, 
however, that such consideration is quite simple; that a 
conversational "script" (Schank and Abelson 1977), 
involving the specification of the part the expert desires 
the apprentice to pick up and the assembly action to be 
performed on it, could handle the data. I argue that 
because the script notion of role already incorporates the 
expected goals of the parties who are playing each role, a 
script argument supports the position that noun phrase 
interpretation requires analysis of speaker intent. 
4. The apprentice fits the noun phrase into the script for 
his role in the experiment. Scripts (Schank and Abel- 
son 1977) contain expected sequences of actions, 
related in some "causal chain", in some stereotyped 
situation. According to Schank and Abelson, typical 
scripted situations might include birthday parties, 
restaurants, classrooms, etc. Scripts are parameter- 
ized by "slots" that define "roles" in the various 
actions and events. Essentially, a script's partic- 
ipants perform the specified actions, which, having 
been a successful pattern of interaction in the past, 
are already structured to achieve the goal(s) of the 
script. "Dialogue Games" Levin and Moore (1977) 
can be seen as scripts once utterances are viewed as 
communicative acts. 
I claim that a script analysis of the discourses in 
the present experiment, if sufficiently detailed, 
supports the positions that (1) noun phrase interpre- 
tation requires an analysis of speaker intent, and (2) 
the speaker's intent is that the hearer perform an 
action of referent identification. The argument has 
three prongs: the contents of the purported script, 
the apprentice's inferring of that script, and the 
relationship of the script to the utterances. 
First, as Schank and Abelson have pointed out, 
scripts are frozen plans. When two parties agree 
(perhaps tacitly) to play roles in a script, they have 
adopted their (respective) expected actions as part of 
their (respective) plans. This observation supports 
both of the above points. The contents of the script 
become expected goals, and the script contains 
actions that each participant is supposed to play. 
Any specification of the actions in the purported 
experimental script will contain the apprentice's 
performing IDENTIFY-REFERENT actions as a goal 
of the expert. 
Second, the script needs to be inferred. The stan- 
dard, well-worn, mundane activities (such as eating 
at a restaurant) that are claimed to be captured in 
scripts may not apply here. Apprentices may never 
have been in similar circumstances before (such as 
being in an experiment, or being instructed over a 
telephone), and thus may not have had a preexisting 
script. Furthermore, the apprentices were not told 
the script in the instructions nor by the expert 
(generally speaking, although there were a few 
exceptions). Thus, to the extent hat a script is avail- 
able to the participants, it would have been 
inferred, z9 Because scripts are frozen plans, to infer a 
script, apprentices would have engaged in a process 
of plan recognition in advance of engaging in the 
experimental task, or while the task was being 
achieved. 
This process of inferring a script yields a set of 
expected actions. The plan-based theory of commu- 
nication would require that the elements of a script 
be mutually expected and intended - i.e., that they 
would represent mutual beliefs about intended future 
actions. Such mutual expectations about each others' 
goals can terminate the process of plan recognition 
27 It is apparent that the two NP's are spoken with different intonation 
and timing. Prosodic aspects of an utterance are often regarded as 
signalling the speaker's attitude or intent oward what is being said. 
Thus, perhaps the speaker is prosodically signalling the "wait while I 
identify" intent. This conclusion supports the argument that speaker 
intent plays a role in processing descriptions. 
28 The "referential communication" literature considers the converse 
position - whether speakers are egocentric in producing noun phrases 
for a hearer (Asher 1979). 
29 No mechanisms have been proposed in the literature that can derive 
such expectations of the expert's goals from more basic information 
about he task, modality, genre, etc. At most, what has been proposed is 
the ability to use such expectations, independently of how they are 
derived. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 117 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
applied to utterance interpretation. Thus, the infer- 
ring of a script that contains the expert's intent that 
the hearer identify the referents of descriptions is 
consistent with my proposal. 
Although much of the determination of speaker intent 
has been precomputed, the utterance itself cannot be 
ignored. The results of this study show that speakers in 
the Telephone condition do not achieve their referential 
goals with direct requests, as they do in the Written 
condition (Tierney et al 1983). The analysis of indi- 
rection used here (and similarly advocated by most 
speech act theorists) requires that speaker intent be 
recognized as a function, in part, of utterance form. 
Possible specifications of illocutionary force are derived 
from features of the utterance. Indirect speech acts are 
recognized through a chain of intended plan-recognition 
inferences (based on mutual beliefs) deriving subsequent 
intended inferences that, if confirmed by mutually 
expected goals, communicate speaker intent. 
One might still argue that the reasoning involved in 
processing these indirect speech acts has become short- 
circuited into a convention of language usage. According 
to such an account, "conscious" inference is unnecessary 
for utterances with conventional forms, such as "Can you 
do X?" For such utterances, the argument goes, people 
simply "know" such utterances are conventional 
requests. In contrast, the plan-based theory would 
appear to propose a Baroque way of uncovering the 
speaker's intention. 
Apart from the lack of evidence that, for example, the 
"there's a" construction has become conventionalized, 
accounts of indirect speech acts based solely on conven- 
tion are inadequate. A conventional account cannot 
handle the many creative uses of indirection (e.g., "It 's 
cold in here"), nor the case of intended literal interpreta- 
tions of conventionally indirect speech acts (such as 
asking a companion on a lifeboat, "Can you swim to 
shore?"). The plan-based theory is suited to such cases. 
On the other hand, the indirect speech acts that are 
usually regarded as conventional can be handled within 
the plan-based theory in a comparably efficient way, 
because inference paths can be precomputed from 
surface speech acts characterizing utterance forms (rath- 
er than always being derived from first principles, as vari- 
ous critiques assume). "Bottom-up" derived rules can be 
used in concert with the more general-purpose rules, 
much as lemmas are used in a proof (Cohen and 
Levesque 1980). 30 Such an "ability is needed to account 
for examples uch as "Can you reach the hammer", that 
cannot be handled by conventional methods alone (which 
would only be able to derive a request to reach the 
hammer, rather than as a request o pass it). 
Scripts are often viewed as short-cuts for more general 
processing. The plan-based position advocated here 
conforms to the intuition that scripted situations should 
give rise to simple processing. By combining strong top- 
down expectations with bottom-up derived rules based 
on utterance form, utterances can be interpreted with 
minimal inference. However, because the plan-based 
approach incorporates both short-cuts and general mech- 
anisms for reasoning about speaker intent, the theory 
applies equally well in nonscripted situations. 
In summary, a script analysis, if appropriately detailed 
and formalized, supports the position that speaker intent 
plays a role in noun phrase interpretation, and that refer- 
ent identification eeds to be reasoned about in the same 
way as other acts. Essentially, the argument states that 
scripts are frozen plans, that apprentices inferred these 
plans, and that the plans indicated that the apprentice 
should perform actions of referent identification. 
The next section shows that the data in this exper- 
iment cause difficulty for Searle's analysis of referring. 
Furthermore, it shows that the present analysis can be 
extended to cover those cases of referring for which 
Searle's is applicable. 
8 Referring as Requesting 
Searle (1969) has argued forcefully that referring is a 
speech act; that people refer, not just expressions. This 
section considers what kind of speech act referring might 
be. I propose a generalization of Searle's "propositional" 
act of referring that treats it as an illocutionary act, a 
request, and I argue that a special level of propositional 
acts for referring is unnecessary. 
The essence of the argument is as follows: First, I 
consider Searle's definition of the propositional act of 
referring (which I term the PAA, for Propositional Act 
Account). This definition is found to be inadequate to 
deal with various utterances in discourse used for the sole 
purpose of referring. Although the relevance of such 
utterances to the propositional act has been defined away 
by Searle, it is clear that any comprehensive account of 
referring should treat them. I show that the act of 
requesting referent identification, which I term the illocu- 
tionary act analysis (IAA) satisfies Searle's conditions for 
referring, yet alo captures utterances that the PAA 
cannot. The converse position is then examined: Can 
the IAA capture the same uses of referring expressions as 
the PAA? If one extends the perceptually based notion 
of referent identification to include Searle's concept of 
identification, then by associating a complex proposi- 
tional attitude to one use of the definite determiner, a
request can be derived. The IAA thus handles the refer- 
ring use of definite noun phrases with independently 
motivated rules. Referring becomes a kind of requesting. 
Hence, the propositional act of referring is unnecessary. 
3o These derived rules are akin to Morgan's (1978) "short-circuited 
implicatures".

Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
8.1 Referr ing  as a propos i t iona l  speech  act  
Revising Austin's (1962) locutionary/illocutionary 
dichotomy, Searle distinguishes between illocutionary 
acts (IAs) and propositional acts (PAs) of referring and 
predicating. Both kinds of acts are performed in making 
an utterance, but propositional acts can only be 
performed in the course of performing some illocutionary 
act. 
Let us consider Searle's rules for referring, the PAA. 
A speaker, S, "successfully and non-defectively performs 
the speech act of singular identifying reference" in utter- 
ing a referring expression, R, in the presence of hearer, 
H, in a context, C, if and only if: 
1. Normal input and output conditions obtain. 
2. The utterance of R occurs as part of the utterance of 
some sentence (or similar stretch of discourse) T. 
3. The utterance of T is the (purported) performance of 
an iUocutionary act. 
4. There exists some object X such that either R 
contains an identifying description of X or S is  able 
to supplement R with an identifying description of X. 
5. S intends that the utterance of R will pick out or 
identify X to H. 
6. S intends that the utterance of R will identify X to H 
by means of H's recognition of S's intention to iden- 
tify X, and he intends this recognition to be achieved 
by means of H's knowledge of the rules governing R
and his awareness of C. 
7. The semantical rules governing R are such that it is 
correctly uttered in T in C if and only if conditions 
1-6 obtain." (Searle 1969, pp. 94-95.) 
Conditions 2 and 3 are justified as follows: 
Propositional acts cannot occur alone; that is one 
cannot just \[emphasis in original - PRC\] refer and 
predicate without making an assertion or 
asking a question or performing some other 
illocutionary act .... One only refers as part of 
the performance of an illocutionary act, and 
the grammatical clothing of an illocutionary 
act is the complete sentence. An utterance of 
a referring expression only counts as referring 
if one says something. (Ibid, p. 25.) 
The essence of Conditions 4 and 5 is that the speaker 
needs to utter an "identifying description", For Searle, 
"identification" means ".... there should no longer be any 
doubt what exactly is being talked about". (Ibid, p. 85.) 
Furthermore, not only should the description be an iden- 
tifying one (one that would pick out an object), but the 
speaker should intend it to do so uniquely (Condition 5). 
Moreover, the speaker's intention is supposed to be 
recognized by the hearer (Condition 6). This last Grice- 
an condition is needed to distinguish having the hearer 
pick out an object by referring to it from, for example, 
hitting him in the back with it. 
8.2 Prob lems for  the  propos i t iona l  act  account  
I have shown that in giving instructions over a telephone, 
speakers, but not users of keyboards, often make sepa- 
rate utterances for reference and for predication. 
Frequently, these "referential utterances" take the form 
of existential sentences, such as "Now, there's a black 
O-ring", Occasionally, speakers use questioned noun 
phrases - "OK, now, the smallest of the red pieces?" The 
data present wo problems for the PAA. 
8.2.1 Referr ing  as a sentent ia l  phenomenon 
Conditions 2 and 3 require the referring expression to be 
embedded in a sentence or "similar stretch of discourse" 
that predicates omething of the referent as part of the 
performance of some illocutionary act. However, it is 
obvious that speakers can refer by issuing isolated noun 
phrases or prepositional phrases. Because speakers 
performed illocutionary acts in making these utterances, 
then, according to Conditions 2 and 3, there should be an 
act of predication, either in the sentence or the "similar 
stretch of discourse". For example, consider the follow- 
ing dialogue fragment: 
1. "Now, the small blue cap we talked about before?" 
2. "Uh-huh" 
3. "Put that over the hole on the side of that tube...." 
The illocutionary act performed by uttering phrase (1) 
is finished and responded to in phrase (2) before the illo- 
cutionary act performed in phrase (3) containing the 
predication "put" is performed. The appeal to a sentence 
or stretch of discourse in which to find the illocutionary 
act containing the propositional act in (1) is therefore 
unconvincing. The cause of this inadequacy is that, 
according to Searle, to perform an illocutionary act, an 
act of predicating is required, and the predicate must be 
uttered (Searle, op. cir., pp. 126-127). Hence, there is no 
appeal to context to supply obvious predications. Like- 
wise, there is no room for context to supply an obvious 
focus of attention. Unfortunately, we can easily imagine 
cases in which an object is mutually, but nonlinguis- 
tically, focused on (e.g., when Holmes, having come 
upon a body on the ground, listens for a heartbeat, and 
says to Watson: "Dead").  In such a case, we need only 
predicate. Thus, the requirement that the act of refer- 
ence be jointly located with some predication in a 
sentence or illocutionary act is too restrictive - the goals 
involved with reference and predication can be satisfied 
separately and contextually. The point of this paper is to 
bring such goals to the fore. 
Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 119 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
8.2.2 Referring wi thout  a propositional act 
The second problem is that many of the separate utter- 
ances issued to secure reference were declarative 
sentences whose logical form was 3 x P(x). Consider, for 
example, "There is a little yellow piece of rubber", and, 
"it's got a plug in it". However, Searle claims that these 
utterances contain no act of referring (to x). (Searle, op. 
cit., p. 29.) How then can speakers use them to refer? 
The answer involves our analysis of indirect speech 
acts. Although such declarative utterances can be issued 
just to be informative, they are also issued as requests 
that the hearer identify the referent. The analysis of 
these utterances as requests depends on our positing an 
action of referent identification. 
8.3 Accounting for Searle's conditions on refer- 
ring 
Assume Searle's Condition 1, the "normal I /O  condi- 
tions." For the reasons outlined above, do not assume 
Conditions 2 and 3. Now, clearly, a speaker's planning 
of a request hat the hearer identify the referent of some 
description should comply with the rules for requesting; 
the speaker is trying to achieve one of the effects of the 
requested action (i.e., IDENTIFIED-REFERENT) by way 
of communicating (in the Gricean sense) his intent that 
the hearer perform the action, provided that it is shared 
knowledge that the hearer can do the action. The last 
condition is true if it is shared knowledge that the 
precondition to the action holds, which includes Searle's 
existential Condition 4. Searle's Condition 5 states that 
the speaker intends to identify the referent o the hearer. 
This condition is captured in the IAA by the hearer's 
recognizing that the speaker intends to achieve the effect 
of the referent identification act, 
IDENTIFIED-REFERENT. Finally, Searle's Gricean 
intent recognition, Condition 6, takes hold in the same 
way that it does for other illocutionary acts, namely by 
virtue of a "feature" of the utterance (e.g., utterance 
mood) that is correlated with a complex propositional 
attitude. This attitude becomes the basis for subsequent 
reasoning about the speaker's plans. In summary, 
Searle's conditions can be accounted for by simply posit- 
ing an action that the speaker equests and that the hear- 
er reasons about and performs. 
8.4 Extending the analysis 
So far, the IAA and PAA are complementary. They each 
account for different aspects of referring. The IAA char- 
acterizes utterances whose sole purpose is to secure 
referent identification, and the PAA characterizes the use 
of referring phrases within an illocutionary act. I now 
proceed to show how the IAA can subsume the PAA. 
Searle argues that one use of the definite article in 
uttering an NP is to indicate the speaker's intention to 
refer uniquely. Moreover, from Condition 5, this inten- 
tion is supposed to be recognized by the hearer. We can 
get this effect by correlating the expression in Figure 5 
with the definite determiner, where (DONE Agt Act P) is 
true if the Agt has done Act, thereby producing the state 
of affairs P. Think of this entire expression as being a 
pragmatic "feature" of a syntactic constituent, as in 
current linguistic formalisms. When this expression is 
applied to a descriptor (supplied from the semantics of 
the NP), we have a complete formula that becomes the 
seed for deriving a request. Namely, if the hearer 
believes that the uttering of the determiner was inten- 
tional (which, of course, he does), then the hearer 
believes that the speaker wants him to think there is a 
unique object that speaker wants him to pick out. If it is 
mutually believed, the hearer can do it (i.e., the precon- 
ditions to the referent identification act hold, and the 
hearer knows how to do it by decomposing the 
description into a plan of action), the hearer believes that 
the speaker's goal is that he believe of some object that 
the speaker's goal is that he have picked it out. Hence, a 
request can be derived. 31 Thus, for the perceptual case, 
the IAA subsumes the PAA. 
Assume that instead of just considering the act of 
identification in its perceptual sense, we adopt Searle's 
concept - namely that ".... there should no longer be any 
doubt what exactly is being talked about." Identification 
in this sense is primarily a process of establishing a co-re- 
ferential link between the description in question and 
some other whose referent is in some way known to the 
hearer. However, we again regard identification as an 
act that the hearer performs, not something the speaker 
does to/for a hearer. If an analysis of this extended 
notion can be made similar in form to the analysis of the 
perceptual identification act, then the IAA completely 
subsumes the PAA. Because both accounts are equally 
vague on what constitutes identification (as are, for that 
matter, all other accounts of which I am aware), the 
choice between them must rest on other grounds. The 
grounds favoring the identification request analysis 
include the use of separate utterances and illocutionary 
acts for its analysis of referring, and the independently 
motivated satisfaction of Searle's conditions on referring. 
8.5 Searle vs. Russell 
Using the propositional act of referring, Searle argues 
against Russell's (1905) theory of descriptions, which 
holds that the uttering of an expression "the if" is equiv- 
3, The analysis of referring in Cohen (1984) makes use of a theory of 
communication f Cohen and Levesque (1980, in preparation) that 
does not require the recognition f illocutionary acts. Instead, IA's are 
derived as theorems about he speaker's goals. The analysis of request- 
ing in this theory would state that the request theorem is applicable 
when Searle claims that an act of referring is performed, and, as we 
have seen, at other times as well. Thus, the hearer does not have to 
recognize each referring act as a request; each referring act merely has 
to be characterizable as one.

alent to the assertion of a uniquely existential proposi- 
tion, "There is a unique ,~". Thus, when reference fails, 
it is because the uniquely existential proposition is not 
true. Searle claims instead that the existence of the refer- 
ent is a precondition to the action of referring. In refer- 
ring to X, we do not assert that X exists any more than 
we do in hitting X (Searle, op. cit., p. 160.) However, 
the precondition is necessary for successful performance. 
Searle's argument against this theory essentially comes 
down to: 
.... It \[Russell's theory\] presents the propositional 
act of definite reference, when performed with 
definite descriptions ... as equivalent to the illocu- 
tionary act of asserting a uniquely existential 
proposition, and there is no coherent way to inte- 
grate such a theory into a theory of illocutionary 
acts. Under no condition is a propositional act 
identical with the illocutionary act of assertion, for 
a propositional ct can only occur as part of some 
illocutionary act, never simply by itself. 
(Searle, op. cit., p. 15.) 
There are two difficulties with this argument. First, 
the requirement that acts of referring be part of an illocu- 
tionary act was shown to be unnecessarily restrictive. 
Second, there is a way to assimilate the assertion of an 
existential proposition - an act that Searle claims does 
not contain a referring act - into an analysis of illocu- 
tionary acts, namely as an indirect request for referent 
identification. However, because an assertion of a 
uniquely existential proposition may fail to convey an 
indirect request for referent identification (just as utter- 
ing, "It 's cold in here", may fail to convey an indirect 
request), Searle's argument, though weakened, still 
stands. 
8.6 Summary  
There are a number of advantages for treating referent 
identification as an action that speakers request, and thus 
for treating the speech act of referring as a request. The 
analysis not only accounts for data that Searle's analysis 
cannot, but also predicts each of Searle's conditions for 
performing the act of singular identifying reference, while 
allowing for appropriate xtension into a planning proc- 
ess. If we extend the perceptual use of referent identifi- 
cation to Searle's more general concept of identification, 
and we correlate a certain (Gricean) propositional atti- 
tude with the use of definite determiners in a noun 
phrase, then Searle's analysis is subsumed by the act of 
requesting referent identification. The propositional act 
of referring is therefore unnecessary. 
9 Conc lus ions  
This paper has had five objectives: to develop a method- 
ology for analyzing discourse pragmatics; to apply it in 
comparing spoken and keyboard discourse; to explore 
the differences in utterance function across modes 
(particularly in the pragmatics of reference); to evaluate 
the adequacy of a plan-based theory of communication 
for analyzing discourse; and to compare the resulting 
analysis with Searle's. I shall first summarize the empir- 
ical findings and the theory's adequacy, and then discuss 
implications for computational linguistics. 
9.1 Summary  of  f ind ings 
Spoken and keyboard-based instructional discourse, even 
used for the same ends, differ in structure and in form. 
Telephone conversation about object assembly is domi- 
nated by explicit requests to identify objects satisfying 
descriptions. This paper makes no attempt o explain 
why it is that speakers break up the referring and predi- 
cating functions, but users of keyboards do not. Many 
intuitive explanations come to mind - channel band- 
width, memory limitations on the speaker or on the hear- 
er, etc. Rather than attempt more detailed investigation 
of the causes of the phenomena, I concentrate instead on 
applying a plan-based theory to derive the coders' 
analyses of the speakers' intentions. 
Only rarely are identification requests performed 
directly. The plan-based theory was shown to capture 
many of the indirect requests (69%). However, it needs 
to be extended in many ways. In particular, the theory 
does not yet account for the inferring of expected goals 
from analyses of the communication task, the physical 
setting, and the modality constraints. It cannot relate 
perceptual actions to the act of searching for something, 
and it cannot capture the parallelism evident in speakers'

prosodically questioning referent identification in the 
course of issuing an imperative utterance. 
I have argued that the need to process indirect identifi- 
cation requests requires hearers to reason about the 
speaker's intention that the hearer perceptually identify 
the referents of various descriptions. This reasoning 
process involves determining how (the bearer's perform- 
ing) an action of referent identification might fit into the 
speaker's plans. The treatment of referent identification 
as an action that speakers request not only accounts for 
the data, but also predicts each of Searle's conditions for 
performing the act of singular identifying reference while 
it allowing for appropriate extension into a planning 
process. 
The promissory note introduced by this approach is to 
show how the same kind of plan-based reasoning used in 
analyzing indirect speech acts can take hold when a hear- 
er realizes he cannot, and was not intended to, identify 
the referent of a description. That is, plan-based reason- 
ing should explain how a hearer might decide that the 
speaker's intention cannot be what it appears to be 
(based on the intent correlated with the use of a definite 
determiner), leading him, for example, to decide to treat 
a description attributively (Donnellan 1960). Moreover, 
such reasoning should be useful in determining intended 
referents, as Ortony (1978) has argued. 
To cash in this promissory note, one needs to be 
specific about speaker intentions for other uses of noun 
phrases. This will be no easy task. One difficulty will be 
to capture the distinction between achieving effects on a 
hearer, and doing so communicatively (i.e., in the Grice- 
an way). Thus, for example, a hearer cannot comply 
with the illoeutionary act, "Quick, don't think of an 
elephant", because there seems to be an "automatic" 
process of "concept activation" (Appelt 1981). Achiev- 
ing effects noncommunicatively, without the recognition 
of intent, may be central to some kinds of reference. In 
such cases, speakers would be able to identify referents 
for a hearer. If this held for singular identifying refer- 
ence, then there could be grounds for a propositional act. 
However, we might have to give up the Gricean Condi- 
tion 5, which I suspect Searle would not want to do. 
Although it has been demonstrated that the action of 
perceptual identification differs from other treatments of 
reference in computational linguistics, perceptual identifi- 
cation has not yet been formalized in a precise way. A 
formalism should indicate when identification is neces- 
sary, how it relates to the performance of physical action, 
and how the perceptual actions that comprise it are 
related to the structure of the descriptions. Nonetheless, 
I hope to have demonstrated the importance of formaliz- 
ing this action. 
The methodology of attempting to explain the 
discourse analyses of two observers is clearly good 
theoretical hygiene, but is difficult to implement in prac- 
tice. Care must be taken to assure that coders are not 
asked to make too many judgments at once (they get 
confused), or to make subtle judgments. For example, 
coders were not able to differentiate questions from 
requests for confirmation reliably, even though they were 
provided with formal definitions for the communicative 
actions and the intuitive distinctions were clear. In fact, 
my providing the coders with formal definitions may have 
been counterproductive b cause the definitions did not 
necessarily mirror people's eommonsense distinctions. 
One lesson to be learned from the difficult experience 
of getting others to "code" the illoeutionary acts in a 
dialogue is that because it is so difficult, perhaps it is not 
done by the participants. It is certainly possible that 
eonversants engage in dialogue without being able to 
specify precisely, using illocutionary verbs, just which illo- 
cutionary acts were performed. Because elsewhere 
(Cohen and Levesque 1980, in preparation) we have 
developed formalisms for communication that do not 
require the identification of illocutionary acts, it may be 
unnecessary to require the hearer to do so. Therefore, 
empirical support is needed for the often presupposed 
position that hearers must identify illocutionary acts. 
9.2 Imp l i ca t ions  for  computat iona l  l inguist ics 
The simple communication task analyzed here involved 
primarily the performing of requests. As such, it should 
fall within the scope of computational linguistic tech- 
niques. However, no natural language system that I 
know can handle the discourse structure of the Tele- 
phone data. Of course, one might be able to develop a 
system that could handle just the data found here. But, 
we would value more a system (or theory, for that 
matter) that handles such data because of general princi- 
ples it embodies. It is for this reason that I have applied 
a general purpose plan-based theory. 
An extrapolation of the empirical results results 
suggests that if robots are to be instructed with spoken 
natural language, they are likely to encounter indirect 
identification requests. If their language processing is 
based on inferring and responding to the speaker's intent, 
then intent recognition will have to be applied to the act 
of identifying a referent. However, given sufficient 
restrictions on the domain of discourse and the robot's 
capabilities, an implementation of the plan-recognition 
process might simplify the general case. I have suggested 
that derived inference rules coupled with expectations 
can serve adequately. A formal foundation for such 
derived rules for intent interpretation can be found in 
Cohen and Levesque (1980, in preparation), and a 
prototype implementation that uses both general and 
derived rules for interpreting speaker intent is described 
in Brachman et al (1979). 
Additional problem areas suggested by this research 
include developing formal and computational models of 
122 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
the generation of useful descriptions, and getting 
machines to plan reference and predication separately. 3z 
However, if given more resources, ystems hould be able 
to "optimize" referring and predicating plans into single 
utterances. Conversely, systems ought to be able to 
reason about the speakers' uses of descriptions - for 
identification, correcting previous misidentifications, 
attribution, etc. 
The empirical findings of this study must be interpret- 
ed with three cautionary notes. First, the category of 
identification requests is specific to discourse situations in 
which the topics of conversation include objects phys- 
ically present o the hearer. If the conversation is not 
about manipulating concrete objects, different pragmatic 
inferences could be made, even though the same surface 
forms might be used. Second, not all natural language 
communication between person and machine are accu- 
rately captured by the Telephone and Keyboard condi- 
tions. For example, conversations about the contents of 
the system's display scope (Brachman et al 1979, Wino- 
grad 1972) might share some aspects of the Face-to-Face 
condition (especially the experts' use of sentence frag- 
ments to correct the apprentices' mistakes). Thus, the 
generality of these findings will only be established when 
conversations in other discourse situations are analyzed. 
Third, it should be realized that the indirection results 
may occur only in conversations between humans. It is 
possible that people do not wish to verbally instruct 
others with fine-grained imperatives for fear of sounding 
condescending. Print may remove such inhibitions, as 
may talking to a machine. The question of how people 
will speak to machines probably cannot be settled until 
good speech-understanding systems have been devel- 
oped. Nevertheless, in building future speech-under- 
standing systems, it may be unwise to underestimate he 
frequency of indirect speech acts in spoken discourse. 
Finally, I observe again that when computational 
linguistic techniques have been developed based on a 
corpus of dialogues, most often those dialogues have 
been conducted through keyboard interaction. However, 
it is clear from the results of this study that keyboard 
communication is distinctly different from other modali- 
ties. In addition to differences from telephone communi- 
cation, a cursory examination of the handwritten 
transcripts reveals that keyboard communication is mark- 
edly different in structure from written communication. 
Whereas experts in keyboard mode rarely use identifica- 
tion requests, writers use them frequently, in both direct 
and indirect forms. Furthermore, writers often 
performed all identification requests first, and labeled 
each of the objects for future reference (much as authors 
of published assembly instructions do). Keyboard inter- 
action, in its emphasis on optimal packing of information 
into the smallest linguistic "space", appears to be a mode 
n See Appelt (1981 ) for a system that operates along these lines. 
of communication that alters the normal organization of 
discourse. We should thus be wary of our theories' and 
techniques' coverage if they are to extended to other 
modalities of communication.

Instructions for the Expert 
We are studying communication between individuals. 
We want to examine how an individual effectively 
communicates a set of instructions to another. The 
purpose of this experiment is to observe and document 
the variety and similarities among different communica- 
tive styles. 
If you decide to participate, you will be randomly 
assigned to another individual taking part in the exper- 
iment, and to communication modality. Each pair is to 
cooperate in building a water cannon pump. You will 
have been previously trained to build the pump, but will 
not be allowed to touch any of the parts during the 
experiment. Your partner will do the actual building. 
You should be aware that your partner will know very 
little about the task. You must be sure to explain what 
the task is, make sure they build the pump, and check to 
see that the pump functions correctly. 
The schedule for your role in the experiment is as 
follows. Today you will read the instructions for building 
the water pump and then practice building it. After 
about 20 minutes, we will ask you to instruct one of us. 
If there are no problems with this practice run, then you 
are free to leave and tomorrow you will come in and 
instruct your partner. If you do have difficulty or have 
any doubts about your ability to remember till tomorrow 
how to assemble the pump, then we want you to stay and 
practice for at least another ten minutes. 
The communication will take place in one of the 
following modes: face-to-face, telephone, teletype, 
audiotape, or written. You will learn the specifics of 
your mode in the next session. Depending on the mode 
of communication, you may be recorded on video or 
audio tape. These tapes will be used for the collection of 
data and not for any other purpose. 
All fellow subjects Will be adult university students.

Instructions for Building a Water  Cannon 
Building a Water.Cannon: 
1. Plug the hole in the bottom of the plunger with the 
plunger plug. 
2. Insert the plunger into the main tube. The red 
handle of the plunger should extend from the non- 
threaded end of the main tube. 
3. Press the blue tube cap down onto the main tube so 
it fits firmly. 
4. Drop the O-ring into the tube base. 
5. Fit the pink base valve onto the top of the tube base. 
The valve should cover the hole in the base. 
6. Fit the feed tube onto the bottom of the base. 
7. Screw the tube base onto the main tube. 
8. Put the tube cap over the upper outlet of the main 
tube. 
9. Fit the slide valve loosely into the lower outlet of the 
main tube. 
Using the Water Cannon: 
1. Place the pump into a tray of water. The pump 
should be supported by the feed tube. 
2. Move the plunger up and down by alternately push- 
ing and pulling on the red handle. 
3. Water will be forced out the lower outlet of the main 
tube, through the spout, through the air chamber, 
and out through the nozzle. 
4. Water will continue to be forced out the nozzle as 
long as you keep moving the plunger up and down. 
5. If nothing happens, check to see that all parts fit 
tightly and that the valves are properly sealed. 
Telephone 
Talk to your partner as you would during a normal phone 
conversation. Your partner will have his/her hands free 
during the entire conversation and will be able to 
construct the pump without interruptions. 
Your partner will have all the necessary pieces and a 
tray of water. Again, the task is to assemble the pump 
and ensure that it works. Your partner does not know 
anything about the task. 
Teletype 
Just type as you would on a typewriter. The print will 
not appear as soon as it is typed in; there will be a small 
delay. If you experience any long delays in seeing the 
characters you typed it is probably due to heavy use of 
the computer. Please bear with it. 
Finally, it is possible the computer will stop working 
during the experiment. Everything before a stopage will 
be saved and we will attempt o continue the experiment 
as soon as possible. 
Your partner will have all the necessary pieces and a 
tray of water. Again, the task is to assemble the pump 
and ensure that it works. Your partner does not know 
anything about the task.

Appendix B: Coding Categories 
The following is the list of parts and their respective 
codes. Subparts are indented on a new line after the 
main part. To avoid confusion, subpart names are used 
where needed.

Subassemblies 
Occasionally, subjects mention a grouping of parts to be 
regarded as subassemblies, which are then connected 
together to form the pump. The following are typical 
ones - what a particular expert groups into one subas- 
sembly is up to him/her, so we were not strict on what 
are the constituents of a subassembly. 
? Base-assembly 
BASSM = { TB, V2,STA ND, ORING } 
? Spout-assembly 
SPASSM = {SPOUT, V3, 02} 
? Main-tube-assembly 
MTASSM = {MT, PASS, PLUG, T-CAP} 
? Air-chamber-assembly 
ARCHMASSM = {SPOUT, NOZ, AIR-CH} 
Functions 
The following functions can be applied to (the right) 
parts and yield the appropriate aspects of those parts. 
So, "Bump" can be applied to the tube base TB to yield 
the set of 2 bumps protruding from it. 
? Bump 
? Hole 
? Threaded-end 
? Nonthreaded-end 
? Thin-end 
? Fat-end 
Act ions  
The following are the set of actions that are generally 
used in building the pump. 
? PICK-UP(part) 
? PUT-DOWN(part) 
? PUT-INTO(inserted-part receiving-part) 
? PUSH-INTO(inserted-part receiving-part) 
? COVER(covering-part covered-part) 
? SCREW-TOGETHER(female-part male-part) 
? MESH(hole-part bump-part) 
? CONNECT(enclosing-part enclosed-part) 
? ORIENT(part owards/away-from(part)) 
? STOP \[action\] 
? UNDO(most-recent-action+2nd-mr-action+...+ last- 
action-to-undo) 
? PUMP \[handle\] 
The next action makes the pump or subassembly from 
the set of pieces. It was only coded when the expert gave 
an overview of a number of steps before instructing how 
to do the substeps. 
? ASSEMBLE (PUMP or  sub-assembly) 
? ACHIEVE (person relation) 
ACHIEVE stands for "make \[relation\] true." ACHIEVE 
was coded when \[relation\] was on our list below, but the 
action that would achieve A was not mentioned. 
Relations 
The following relations were coded as the content of the 
categories INFORM and ACHIEVE. Appropriately filled- 
in with the right parts, a collection of these relations form 
the goal state of the assembled pump. 
? (ACCESSIBLE part) 
? (HOLDING part) 
? (SUPPORTED partl part2) 
? (INSIDE inserted-part eceiving-part) 
? (COVERS covering-part covered-part) 
? (SCREWED-TOGETHER female-part male-part) 
? (MESHES hole-part bump-part) 
? (CONNECTS enclosing-part enclosed-part) 
? (ORIENTED part) 
? (IDENTIFIED part) 
? (READY EXP/APP) 
? (TIGHT partl part2) partl should be tightly 
connected to part2 
? (LOOSE partl part2) part2 should be loosely 
connected to part2 
? (SEES person object) 
128 Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 
Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication 
? (DOUBTFUL person) 
? (WORKING pump) 
? (COMPLETED action) implies the proposition stated 
as the final state of the action holds. 
All relations could be negated. This was expressed as 
"(NOT-\[relation\])". E.g., (NOT-COMPLETED PICKUP 
(MT))
