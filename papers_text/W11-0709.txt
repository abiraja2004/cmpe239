Abstract
User-contributed content is creating a surge on
the Internet. A list of ?buzzing topics? can
effectively monitor the surge and lead people
to their topics of interest. Yet a topic phrase
alone, such as ?SXSW?, can rarely present
the information clearly. In this paper, we
propose to explore a variety of text sources
for summarizing the Twitter topics, includ-
ing the tweets, normalized tweets via a ded-
icated tweet normalization system, web con-
tents linked from the tweets, as well as inte-
gration of different text sources. We employ
the concept-based optimization framework for
topic summarization, and conduct both au-
tomatic and human evaluation regarding the
summary quality. Performance differences are
observed for different input sources and types
of topics. We also provide a comprehensive
analysis regarding the task challenges.
1 Introduction
User contributed content has become a major source
of information in the Web 2.0 era. People follow
their topics of interest, share their experience or
opinions on a variety of interactive platforms, in-
cluding forums, blogs, microblogs, social network-
ing sites, etc. To keep track of the trends online
and suggest topics of interest to the general public,
many leading websites provide a ?buzzing? service
by publishing the current most popular topics on
their entrance page and update them regularly, such
as the ?popular now? column on Bing.com, ?trend-
ing topics? on Twitter.com, ?trending now? on Ya-
hoo.com, Google Trends, and so forth. Often pop-
ular topics are in the form of a list of keywords or
phrases1. Take Twitter.com as an example. Clicking
on a trending topic phrase will return a set of relevant
Twitter posts (tweets) or web pages. Nonetheless,
whether this is a convenient way for users to navi-
gate through the popular topic information is still ar-
guable. For example, when ?SXSW? was listed as a
trending topic, it seems difficult to understand at the
first glance. A condensed topic summary would be
extremely helpful for the users before diving into the
massive search results to figure out what this topic
phrase is about and why it is trending. In this paper,
our goal is to generate a short text summary for any
given topic phrase. Note that the proposed approach
is not limited to trending topics, but can be applied
to arbitrary Twitter topics.
There are a lot of differences between tweets and
traditional written text that has been widely used
for automatic summarization. In Table 1, we show
example tweets for the topic ?SXSW?. The tweets
were extracted by searching the Twitter site using
the topic phrase as a query. We also provide an ex-
cerpt of the linked web content to help understand
the topic. The tweets present some unique charac-
teristics:
? All tweets are limited to 140 characters. Some
tweets are news headlines from the official me-
dia, others are generated by users with vari-
ous degrees of familiarity with the social me-
dia. The resulting tweets can be very different
regarding the text quality and word usage.
1They are referred to as topic phrases hereafter, with no dis-
tinction between keywords and key phrases.

Table 1: Example tweets and an excerpt of the linked web
content for Twitter topic ?SXSW?.
? Tweets lack structure information, contain var-
ious ill-formed sentences and grammatical er-
rors. There are lots of noisy nonstandard to-
kens, such as abbreviations (?feelin? for ?feel-
ing?), substitutions (?Pr1mr0se? for ?Prim-
rose?), emoticons, etc.
? Twitter invented its own markup language.
?@user? is used to reply to a specific user or
call for attentions. The hashtag ?#topic? aims
to assign a topic label to the tweet, and is fre-
quently employed by the twitter users.
? Tweets frequently contain embedded URLs
that direct users to other online content, such
as news web pages, blogs, organization home-
pages (Wu et al, 2011). According to Twitter?s
news release in September 2010 (Rao, 2010),
25% of tweets contain an URL. These linked
web pages provide a much richer source of in-
formation than is possible in the 140-character
tweet.
These Twitter-specific characteristics may pose
challenges to the automatic summarization systems
for identifying the essential information. In this pa-
per, we focus on two such characteristics that are
not studied in previous literature, the web content
link and the non-standard tokens in tweets. Specif-
ically, we ask two questions: (1) Is the web content
linked from the tweets useful for summarization?
Can we integrate different text sources, including
the tweets and linked web pages, to generate more
informative Twitter topic summaries? (2) what is
the effect of nonstandard tokens on summarization
performance? Will the summaries be improved if
the noisy tweets were pre-normalized into standard
English sentences? We investigate these two ques-
tions under a concept-based summarization frame-
work using integer linear programming (ILP). We
utilize text input that has various quality and is orig-
inated from multiple sources, and thoroughly ana-
lyze the resulting summaries using both automatic
and human evaluation metrics.
2 Related Work
There is not much previous work on summarizing
the Twitter topics. Most previous summarization lit-
erature focused on the written text domain, as driven
by the annual evaluation tracks of the DUC (Doc-
ument Understanding Conference) and TAC (Text
Analysis Conference). To some extent, Twitter topic
summarization is related to spoken document sum-
marization, since both tasks deal with the conver-
sational text that is contributed by multiple par-
ticipants and contains lots of ill-formed sentences,
colloquial expressions, nonstandard word tokens or
high word error rate, etc. To summarize the spo-
ken text, (Zechner, 2002) aimed to address prob-
lems related to disfluencies, extraction units, cross-
speaker coherence, etc. (Maskey and Hirschberg,
2005; Murray et al, 2006; Galley, 2006; Xie et
al., 2008; Liu and Liu, 2010a) incorporated lexical,
structural, speaker, and discourse cues to generate
textual summaries for broadcast news and meeting
conversations.
For microblog summarization, (Sharifi et al,
2010a) proposed a phrase reinforcement (PR) algo-
rithm to summarize the Twitter topic in one sen-
tence. The algorithm builds a word graph using the
topic phrase as the root node; each word node is
weighted in proportion to its distance to the root and
the corresponding phrase frequency. The summary
sentence is selected as one of the highest weighted
paths in the graph. (Sharifi et al, 2010b; Inouye,
2010) introduced a hybrid TF-IDF approach to ex-
tract one- or multiple-sentence summary for each
topic. Sentences were ranked according to the av-
erage TF-IDF score of the consisting words; top
weighted sentences were iteratively extracted, but
excluding those that have high cosine similarity with
the existing summary sentences. They showed the
Hybrid TF-IDF approach performs constantly bet-
67
ter than the PR algorithm and other traditional sum-
marization systems. Our approach of summarizing
the Twitter topics is different from the above stud-
ies in that, we focus on exploring richer informa-
tion sources (such as the online web content) and in-
vestigating effect of non-standard tokens. There are
also studies working on visualizing Twitter topics
by identifying a set of topic phrases and presenting
the related tweets to users (O?Connor et al, 2010;
Marcus et al, 2011). Our proposed approach can be
beneficial to these systems by providing informative
topic summaries generated from rich text sources.
3 Data Collection
We collected 5,537 topic phrases and the reference
topic descriptions by crawling the Twitter.com and
WhatTheTrend.com simultaneously during the pe-
riod of Aug 22th, 2010 to Oct 30th, 2010 (about 70
days). The Twitter API was queried every 5 min-
utes for the current top ten trending topics. For each
of these topics, a search query was submitted to the
Twitter Search API to retrieve only English tweets
related to this topic. If any tweet contains embedded
URLs linked to the other web pages, the contents
of these web pages were retrieved. For each topic,
we limit the maximum number of retrieved tweets to
5,000 and webpages to 100. An example is shown in
Table 1 for a topic phrase, some related tweets, and
an excerpt of the linked webpage. WhatTheTrend
API provides short topic descriptions contributed
and constantly updated by the Twitter users. There
is also a manually assigned category tag for each
topic phrase. We found the top categories among
the collected topics are ?Entertainment (29.26%)?,
?Sports (25.58%)?, and ?Meme (15.69%, pointless
babble)?. We divided the collected topics into two
groups: the general topics (e.g., ?Chilean miners?,
?MTV VMA?) and the hashtag topics that start with
the ?#? (e.g., ?#top10rappers?, ?#octoberwish?).
To generate reference summaries for the Twit-
ter topics, two human annotators were asked to
pick the topic descriptions/sentences (collected from
WhatTheTrend.com) that are appropriate and valu-
able to be included in the summary. This is per-
formed on a selected set of 1,511 topics with both
trending duration and number of tweets greater than
our predefined thresholds. For each of the topic sen-
tences, we ask the annotators to label its category:
(1) the sentence is a general description of the topic;
(2) the sentence is trying to explain why the topic is
trending; (3) it is hard to tell the difference. Over-
all, the two annotators have good agreement (Kappa
= 0.67) regarding whether or not to include a sen-
tence in the summary. Among the selected summary
sentences, 22.58% of them were assigned with con-
flicting purpose tags such as (1) or (2). To form
a reference summary, we concatenate all the topic
sentences selected by both annotators. Since some
reference descriptions are simply repetition of oth-
ers with very minor changes, we reduce the dupli-
cates by iteratively removing the oldest sentences if
all the consisting words are covered by the remain-
ing sentence collection, until no sentence can be re-
moved. On average, the reference summary for gen-
eral and hashtag topics contains 44 and 40 words
respectively.
4 Summarization System
For each of the topic phrases, our goal is to gener-
ate a short textual summary that can best convey the
main ideas of the topic contents. We explore and
compare multiple text sources as summarization in-
put, including the user-contributed tweets, web con-
tents linked from the tweets, as well as combination
of the two sources. The concept-based optimization
approach (Gillick et al, 2009; Xie et al, 2009; Mur-
ray et al, 2010) was employed for selecting informa-
tive summary sentences and minimizing the redun-
dancy. Note that our focus of this paper is not devel-
oping new summarization systems, but rather utiliz-
ing and integrating different text sources for gener-
ating more informative Twitter topic summaries.
4.1 Concept-based Optimization Framework
Concept-based summarization approach first ex-
tracts a set of important concepts for each topic, then
selects a collection of sentences that can cover as
many important concepts as possible, while within
the specified length limit. This idea is realized us-
ing the integer linear programming-based (ILP) op-
timization framework, with objective function set to
maximize the sum of the weighted concepts:
max
?
i
wici
68
where ci is a binary variable indicating whether the
concept i is covered by the summary; wi is the
weight assigned to ci.
We enforce two sets of length constraints to the
summary: sentence- or word-based. Sentence con-
straint requires the total number of selected sum-
mary sentences to not to exceed a length limit L1;
while word constraint requires the total words of
selected sentences not to exceed length limit L2.
These two constraints are:
?
j
sj < L1 or
?
j
ljsj < L2
where sj is a binary variable indicating whether sen-
tence j was selected in the summary; lj represents
the number of words in sj .
Further, we connect concept i with sentence j us-
ing two sets of constraints. For all the sentences that
contain concept i, if any sentence was selected in
the summary, the concept i should be covered by the
summary; reversely, if concept i was covered by the
summary, at least one of the sentences containing
concept i should be selected.
?i ci ?
?
j
oijsj
?i, j ci ? oijsj
where the binary variable oij is used to indicate
whether concept i exists in sentence j.
The concepts are selected by extracting n-grams
(n=1, 2, 3) from the input documents corresponding
to each topic. Similar to (Xie et al, 2009), we re-
move (1) n-grams that appear only once in the docu-
ments; (2) n-grams that have a consisting word with
inverse document frequency (IDF) value lower than
a threshold; (3) n-grams that are enclosed by higher
order n-grams with the same frequency. These fil-
ters are designed to exclude insignificant n-grams
from the concept set. The IDF scores were calcu-
lated from a large background corpus corresponding
to the input text source, using individual sentences
or tweets as pseudo-documents; words with low IDF
scores (such as stopwords) tend to appear in many
sentences and therefore should be removed from the
concept set. We assign a weight wi to an n-gram
concept as follows:
wi = tf(ngrami)? n?max
j
idf(wij)
where tf(ngrami) is the term frequency of ngrami
in the input document of the topic; n denotes the
order of ngrami; wij are the consisting words of
ngrami; idf(wij) represents IDF value of word
wij . This approach aims to extract n-grams that ap-
pear frequently in each topic, but do not appear fre-
quently in a large background corpus. The weights
are also biased towards longer n-grams since they
carry more information.
4.2 Summarization Input
In this section, we explore different text sources
as input to the summarization system. Different
from previous studies that take input from a sin-
gle text source, we propose to utilize both the
user-contributed tweets and the linked web con-
tents for Twitter topic summarization, since these
two sources provide very different text quality and
may contain complementary information regarding
the topic. These text sources also pose great chal-
lenges to the summarization system: the tweets are
short and extremely noisy; while the online contents
linked from the tweets may have vastly different lay-
outs and contain a variety of information.
4.2.1 Original Tweets
As shown in Table 1, the initially collected tweets
are very noisy. They are passed through a set of pre-
processors to remove non-ascii characters, HTML
special characters, URLs, emoticons, punctuation
marks, retweet tags (RT @user), etc. We also re-
move the reply (@) and hashtag (#) tokens that do
not carry important syntactic roles (such as in the
subject or object position) by using a set of regular
expressions. These preprocessed tweets are sorted
by date and taken as the first input source to the sum-
marization system (denoted by ?OrigTweets?).
4.2.2 Normalized Tweets
The original tweets contain various nonstandard
word tokens. In Table 2, we list the possible to-
ken categories and corresponding examples. We hy-
pothesize that normalizing these nonstandard tokens
into standard English words and using the normal-
ized tweets as input can help boost the summariza-
tion performance.
We developed a twitter message normalization
system based on the noisy-channel framework and
a proposed letter transformation model (Liu et al,
69

(7) any combination of (1) to (6) luvvvin, 2moro, m0rnin
Table 2: Nonstandard token categories and examples.
2011). Given a noisy tweet T , our goal is to nor-
malize it into a standard English word sequence S.
Under the noisy channel model, this is equivalent to
finding the sequence S? that maximizes p(S|T ):
S? = argmaxS p(S|T ) = argmaxS(
?
i
p(Ti|Si))p(S)
where we assume that each non-standard token Ti
is dependent on only one English word Si, that is,
we are not considering acronyms (e.g., ?bbl? for ?be
back later?) in this study. p(S) can be calculated
using a language model (LM). We formulate the
process of generating a nonstandard token Ti from
dictionary word Si using a letter transformation
model, and use the model confidence as the prob-
ability p(Ti|Si). This transformation process will be
learned automatically through a sequence labeling
framework. To form a nonstandard token, each let-
ter in the dictionary word can be labeled with: (a)
one of the 0-9 digits; (b) one of the 26 characters
including itself; (c) the null character ?-?; (d) a let-
ter combination. We integrate character-, phonetic-,
and syllable-level features in the model that can ef-
fectively characterize the formation process of non-
standard tokens. In general, the letter transforma-
tion approach will handle the nonstandard tokens
listed in Table 2 yet without explicitly categorizing
them. The proposed system also achieved robust
performance using the automatically collected train-
ing word pairs. On a test set of 3,802 distinct non-
standard tokens collected from Twitter, our system
achieved 68.88% 1-best normalization word accu-
racy and 78.27% 3-best accuracy.
We identify the nonstandard tokens that need to
be normalized using the following criteria: (1) it is
not in the CMU dictionary2; (2) it does not contain
capitalized letter; (3) it appears infrequently in the
2http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict
topic (less than a threshold); (4) it is not a popular
chat acronyms (such as ?lol?, ?omg?); (5) it contains
letters/digits/apostrophe, but should not be numbers
only. These criteria are designed to avoid normaliz-
ing the named entities, frequently appearing out-of-
vocabulary terms (such as ?itunes?), chat acronyms,
usernames, and hashtags. The selected nonstandard
tokens in the original tweets will be replaced by the
system generated 1-best candidate word. Note that
we do not discriminate the context when replacing
each nonstandard token. This will be addressed in
the future work. We use these normalized tweets as
a second source of summarization input and name
them ?NormTweets?.
4.2.3 Linked Web Contents
For each Twitter topic, we collect a set of web
pages linked by the topic tweets and use them as
another source of summarization input. For each
topic, we select up to n (n = 10) URLs that appear
most frequently in the topic tweets and infrequently
across different Twitter topics. This scheme is sim-
ilar to the TF-IDF measure. This way we can se-
lect the salient URLs for each topic while avoiding
the spam URLs. The contents of these URLs were
collected and only distinct web pages were retained.
We use an HTML parser3 to extract the textual con-
tents, and perform sentence segmentation (Reynar
and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) on the parsed web pages.
All the pages corresponding to the same topic were
sorted by the date they were first cited in the tweets.
These web pages were taken as another input text
source for the summarization system, denoted as
?Web?.
4.2.4 Combining Tweets and Web Contents
We expect that taking advantage of both tweets
and linked web contents would benefit the topic
summarization system. Consolidating the distinct
text sources may help boost the weight of key con-
cepts and eliminate the spam information. As a pre-
liminary study, we investigate concatenating either
the original tweets or the normalized tweets with
the linked web pages as input to the concept-based
summarization system. This results in two inputs
?Web + OrigTweets? and ?Web + NormTweets?. We
will explore other ways of combining the two text
3http://jericho.htmlparser.net/docs/index.html
70
sources in future work.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
Among the collected topics, we select 500 general
topics (such as ?Chilean miners?) and 50 hashtag
topics (such as ?#octoberwish?, ?#wheniwasakid?)
for experimentation. On average, a general topic
contains 1673 tweets and 3.43 extracted linked web
pages; while a hashtag topic contains 3316 tweets
but does not have meaningful linked web pages.
The concept-based optimization system was con-
figured to extract a collection of sentences/tweets
for each topic, using either the sentence- or word-
constraint (denoted as ?#Sent? and ?#Word?). We
opt to set individual length constraint for each topic
rather than using a uniform length limit for all the
topics, since the topics can be very different in
length and duration. We use the number of sen-
tences/words in the reference summary as the sen-
tence/word constraint for each topic. Note that in
practice this reference summary length information
may not be available. We use the length constraints
obtained from the reference summary in this ex-
ploratory study, since our focus is to first evaluate if
twitter trending summarization is feasible, and what
are the effects of different information sources and
non-standard tokens. For a comparison to our ap-
proach, we implement the Hybrid TF-IDF approach
in (Sharifi et al, 2010b; Inouye, 2010) as a baseline
using ?OrigTweets? as input. For the baseline, the
summary length is altered according to the sentence-
or word-constraint. The last summary tweet is cut in
the middle if it exceeds the word limit.
The ROUGE-1 F-scores (Lin, 2004) are used to
measure the n-gram (n=1) overlap between the sys-
tem summaries and reference summaries. Since the
ROUGE scores may not correlate well with the hu-
man judgments (Liu and Liu, 2010b), we also per-
formed human evaluation by asking annotators to
score both the system and reference summaries re-
garding the linguistic quality and content respon-
siveness, in the hope this will benefit future research
in this direction.

Table 3: ROUGE-1 F-measure and reference summary
coverage scores for general topics.
ROUGE-4 scores show similar trends and thus are
not presented. Five different text sources were ex-
ploited as the system inputs, as described in Sec-
tion 4.2. To measure the quality of the input for
summarization, we also include reference summary
coverage score in the table, defined as the percent-
age of words in the reference summary that are cov-
ered by the input text source. When using tweets
as input, we also investigate whether we should ap-
ply tweet normalization before or after the summa-
rization process, that is ?pre-normalization? (using
?NormTweets? as input), or ?post-normalization?
(using ?OrigTweets? as input, and rendering the nor-
malized summary tweets).
Compared to the Hybrid TF-IDF approach (Shar-
ifi et al, 2010b; Inouye, 2010), our system per-
forms significantly better (p < 0.05) according
to the paired t-test; however, we also notice the
ROUGE scores are lower compared to summariza-
tion in other text domains. This indicates that Twit-
ter topic summarization is very challenging. Com-
paring the two constraints used in the concept-based
optimization framework, we found that the word
constraint performs constantly better for the gen-
eral topics. This is natural since the word constraint
tightly bounds the length of the system output, while
the sentence constraint is relatively loose. For the
different sources, we notice using linked web pages
alone yields worse summarization performance, as
well as lower reference summary coverage; how-
ever, when combined with the tweets, there is a
slight increase in the coverage scores, and some-
times improved summarization results. This sug-
gests that the linked web pages can contain extra
71
useful information for generating summaries. Re-
garding normalization, results show that the ?pre-
normalization? (using normalized tweets as input)
can generally improve the summary tweet selec-
tion. For general topics, the best performance was
achieved by combining the normalized tweets and
linked web pages as input source and using the
word-level constraint.

Table 4: ROUGE-1 F-measure and reference summary
coverage scores for hashtag topics.
Results for hashtag topics were shown in Table
4 using tweets as input (there are no linked web-
pages for these topics). We notice the reference cov-
erage scores are satisfying, yet the system output
barely matches the reference summaries (very low
ROUGE-1 scores). Looking at the reference and
system generated summaries for the hashtag top-
ics, we found the system output is more specific
(e.g., ?#octoberwish everything goes well.?), while
the reference summaries are often very general (e.g.,
?people tweeting about their wishes for October.?).
The human annotators also noted that most hashtag
topics (such as ?#octoberwish?, ?#wheniwasakid?)
are self-explainable and may require special atten-
tion to redefine an appropriate summary. Using
sentence constraints yields better performance than
word-based one, with larger performance difference
than that for the general topics. We found the
word-constraint summaries tend to include tweets
that are very short and noisy. Our system with
sentence-based length constraint also significantly
outperforms the Hybrid TF-IDF approach (Sharifi
et al, 2010b; Inouye, 2010). For hashtag topics,
the best performance was achieved using the ?pre-
normalization? with sentence constraint.
For an analysis, we generate oracle system per-
formance by using the reference summaries to ex-
tract a set of unweighted concepts to use in the ILP
optimization framework for sentences/tweets selec-
tion. This results in 61.76% ROUGE-1 F-score for
the general topics and 40.34% for the hashtag topics,
indicating abundant space for future improvement.
We also notice that though there is some perfor-
mance gain using normalized tweets and linked web
contents, the improvement is not statistically signifi-
cant as compared to using the original tweets. Upon
closer examination, we found the normalization sys-
tem replaced 1.08% and 1.8% of the total word to-
kens for the general and hashtag topics respectively;
these tokens spread in 13.12% and 16.85% of the
total tweets. The relatively small percentage of the
normalized tokens partly explains the marginal per-
formance gain when using the normalized tweets as
input. Similarly for linked web content, though it
contains some sentences that can provide more de-
tails of the topic, but they can also take more space
in the summary as compared to the short and con-
densed tweets. Therefore using the combined tweets
and linked webpages does not significantly outper-
form using just the tweets.

Table 5: Linguistic quality, content coverage, and useful-

We ask two human annotators to manually evalu-
ate the system and reference summaries regarding
the readability and content coverage. Readability
includes grammaticality, non-redundancy, referen-
tial clarity, and focus; content coverage was eval-
uated for system summaries against the reference
summary. The annotators were also asked to rate
the ?Web? summaries regarding whether they pro-
vided extra useful topic information on top of the
?Tweet? summary. 50 general topics and 25 hash-
tag topics were randomly selected for assessment.
The ?Tweet? and ?Web? summaries were generated

Table 6: Example system and reference summaries for both general and hashtag topics.
asked to judge all the summaries and assign a score
for each criterion on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (5 being
the best quality). The average scores of the two as-
sessors were presented in Table 5.
For general topics, the ?Web? summaries outper-
form the ?Tweet? summaries on both grammatical-
ity and non-redundancy, confirming the advantage
of using the high-quality linked web pages. The
referential clarity and focus scores of the ?Web?
summaries are not very high, since the summary
sentences were extracted simultaneously from sev-
eral web pages, and the system subjects to simi-
lar challenges as in multi-document summarization.
The content coverage scores of both system sum-
maries seem to correlate well with the ROUGE-1
F-measure, with a higher score for ?Tweet? sum-
maries. The assessors also rated that 48% of the
?Web? summaries contain ?Somewhat Useful? ex-
tra topic information, and 21% are ?Very Useful?.
Note that this could be just because of the inherent
difference of the two summaries, regardless of the
input source, but in general we believe the linked
web pages (such as the news documents) can pro-
vide more detailed and coherent stories as compared
to the 140-character tweets. For hashtag topics, the
?Tweet? summaries yield worse grammaticality and
focus scores, but have very high non-redundancy
score. On the contrary, the reference summaries
often contain redundant information. The content
match score between the system and reference sum-
maries (2.6) does not seem to reflect the ROUGE
scores. We hypothesize that even though the speci-
ficity of the two summaries is different, the asses-
sors may still think the system summaries match the
reference ones to some extent. A larger scale human
evaluation is needed to study the correlation between
human and automatic evaluation.
5.4 Discussions
We show an example of reference and system gen-
erated summaries for a general and a hashtag topic
in Table 6, and summarize some challenges for this
summarization task below:
? Gold standard summaries are difficult and
time-consuming to obtain. The reference de-
scriptions from WhatTheTrend.com were cre-
ated by Twitter users, which vary a lot in
word usage and would be unavoidably biased
to the information available in Twitter. The
user-contributed descriptions may also contain
spam descriptions, repetitions, nonstandard to-
kens, etc. It would be better to have a con-
cise non-redundant sentence collection for de-
veloping future summarization systems. In
particular, hashtag topics need special atten-
tion. They account for 40% of the total trend-
ing topics in 2010 according to the statistics
in WhatTheTrend.com4. Yet there still lacks
standard definition regarding a good hashtag
summary. From the example topic ?#wheni-
wasakid? in Table 6, we can see they are very
different in nature from general topics, thus fu-
ture efforts are needed to define an appropriate
summary.

? Evaluation issues. Word based evaluation
measures will rarely consider semantic relat-
edness between concepts, or name entity vari-
ations, such as ?Hewlett-Packard? vs. ?HP?,
?Dell ups 3Par offer? vs. ?Dell Raises 3par
Offer?, etc. When comparing the system
summaries with short human-written reference
summaries, the word overlap varies a lot for
different human summarizers.
? Dynamically changing topics/events. Some
general topics are related to events that are con-
stantly changing. Take the ?3PAR? topic in
Table 6 as an example, where two companies
take turns to raise the bid for 3Par Inc. A good
topic summary should be able to develop a se-
ries of sub-events and show the topic evolving
process.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed to explore a variety of text
sources for summarizing the Twitter topics. We em-
ployed the concept-based optimization framework
with multiple input text sources to generate the sum-
maries. We conducted both automatic and human
evaluation regarding the summary quality. Better
performance is observed when using the normalized
tweets as input, indicating special treatment should
be performed before feeding the noisy tweets to the
summarization system. We also found the linked
web contents can provide extra useful topic infor-
mation. In future work, we will compare our sys-
tem with other dedicated microblog summarization
systems, as well as address some of the challenges
identified in this study.
