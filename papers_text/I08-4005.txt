Abstract 
This paper investigates a machine learning 
approach for identification of temporal re-
lation between events in Chinese text. We 
proposed a temporal relation annotation 
guideline (Cheng, 2007) and constructed 
temporal information annotated corpora. 
However, our previous criteria did not deal 
with various uses of Chinese verbs. For 
supplementing the previous version of our 
criteria, we introduce attributes of verbs 
that describe event types. We illustrate the 
attributes by the different examples of verb 
usages. We perform an experiment to 
evaluate the effect of our event type attrib-
utes in the temporal relation identification. 
As far as we know, this is the first work of 
temporal relation identification between 
verbs in Chinese texts. The result shows 
that the use of the attributes of verbs can 
improve the annotation accuracy. 
1 Introduction 
Extracting temporal information in documents is a 
useful technique for many NLP applications such 
as question answering, text summarization, ma-
chine translation, and so on. The temporal informa-
tion is coded in three types of expressions: 1. tem-
poral expressions, which describe time or period in 
the actual or hypothetical world; 2. event or situa-
tion expressions that occur at a time point or that 
last for a period of time; 3. temporal relations, 
which describe the ordering relation between an 
event expression and a temporal expression, or be-
tween two event expressions.  
There are many researches dealing with the 
temporal expressions and event expressions. Ex-
tracting temporal expressions is a subtask of 
Named Entity Recognition (IREX committee, 1999) 
and is widely studied in many languages. Normal-
izing temporal expressions is investigated in 
evaluation workshops (Chinchor, 1997). Event se-
mantics is investigated in linguistics and AI fields 
(Bach, 1986). However, researches at temporal 
relation extraction are still limited. Temporal rela-
tion extraction includes the following issues: iden-
tifying events, anchoring events on the timeline, 
ordering events, and reasoning with contextually 
underspecified temporal expressions. To extract 
temporal relations, several knowledge resources 
are necessary, such as tense and aspect of verbs, 
temporal adverbs, and world knowledge (Mani, et 
al., 2006).  
In English, TimeBank (Pustejovsky, et al, 2006), 
a temporal information annotated corpus, is avail-
able to machine learning approaches for automati-
cally extracting temporal relation. In Chinese, Li 
(2004) proposed a machine learning based method 
for temporal relation identification, but they con-
sidered the relation between adjacent verbs in a 
small scale corpus. There is no publicly available 
Chinese resource for temporal information proc-
essing. We proposed (Cheng, 2007) a dependency 
structure based method to annotate temporal rela-
tions manually on a limited set of event pairs and 
extend the relations using inference rules. In our 
previous research, the dependency structure helps 
to detect subordinate and coordinate structures in 
sentences. Our proposed criteria can reduce the 
manual effort for annotating the temporal relation 
tagged corpus. 
Our research focuses on the relations between 
events where they are assumed to be described by 
verbs. Verbs in an article can represent events in 
actual world (which describe actual situations or 
actions) and events in hypothetical world (which 
describe possible situations, imagination or back-
ground knowledge). However, our previous re-
search does not define the class of event types. Our

previous annotation guideline requires annotators 
to decide the attributes of temporal relations of a 
verb by annotators? own judgment but does not 
describe the difference between events (verbs) in 
actual and hypothetical world. 
In this paper, we attempt to give the definition 
of actual / hypothetical world events (verbs). We 
collect usages of verbs in Penn Chinese treebank 
and classify them to actual / hypothetical worlds. 
We add another attribute to our previous criteria. 
Then we train the temporal relation annotated cor-
pus to investigate the effect of using the event 
types for automatic annotation.  
In the next section, we describe the criteria of 
temporal relations between events that are pro-
posed in our previous research (Cheng, 2007). In 
section 3, we discuss the event types of verbs and 
define the actual / hypothetical world events. In 
section 4, we perform an experiment of a machine 
learning based temporal relation identifier with and 
without the event type information. Finally, we 
discuss the results of experiments and our future 
direction. 
2 Temporal relations between events 
We propose an annotation guideline for developing 
a Chinese temporal relation annotated corpus. The 
guideline is based on TimeML (Saur?, 2005) and 
focuses on the temporal relations between events. 
To reduce manual effort, we introduce several con-
straints on the original TimeML. First, we restrict 
the definition of events to verbs. Second, we focus 
on three types of event pairs according to syntactic 
dependency structure. 
2.1 The definition of the events 
According to the TimeML guideline for English, 
verbs, nominalized verbs, adjectives, predicative 
and prepositional phrases can represent events. 
However, to recognize an instance of nominalized 
verb represents whether an event or not is difficult 
in Chinese articles. Chunking phrases and clauses 
is another difficult process in Chinese. To simplify 
the process of recognizing events, the criteria only 
regard verbs as events.  
2.2 Three types of event pairs 
The criteria of temporal relation between events 
include three types of event pairs in the complete 
graph as follows:  
 RLP (Relation to Linear Preceding event): 
Relation between the focus event and the ad-
jacent event at the immediately proceeding 
position. (Relation of adjacent event pair). 
 RTA (Relation to Tree Ancestor event): 
Relation between the focus event and the 
ancestor event in a dependency structure 
(Relation of Head-modifier event pair). 
 RTP (Relation to Tree Preceding event): 
Relation between the focus event and its sib-
ling event in a dependency structure (Rela-
tion of Sibling event pair). 
The first type stands for the adjacent event pairs. 
The second and third types are the head-modifier 
event pairs and the sibling event pairs in depend-
ency tree representation of a sentence. Figure 1 
describes the relation of three types of event pairs 
in an article. There are two sentences with twelve 
events (from e1 to e12) in the figure and the poly-
gons with dashed-lines show the boundary of sen-
tences. The angle-line links show adjacent event 
pairs (from Ll-1 to Ll-11). The dotted-line links 
show head-modifier event pairs (from Hl-1 to Hl-
10) and the curve links show sibling event pairs 
(from Sl-1 to Sl-6). The first type (adjacent event

pairs) and the other two types (head-modifier or 
sibling event pairs) are not exclusive. An event 
pair can be a head-modifier event pairs and can be 
a head-modifier event at the same time. 
The adjacent event pair links and the sibling 
event pair links can be used to connect the tempo-
ral relations between sentences. The links Sl-4 and 
Ll-7 span two sentences in the example.  
Subordinate event pairs are head-modifier rela-
tions and coordinate event pairs are sibling rela-
tions. Using dependency structure can help to ex-
tract subordinate relations and coordinate relations 
in a sentence. 
2.3 Deficiency of our previous criteria 
Our criteria can reduce manual effort of temporal 
relation annotation. However, our previous guide-
line does not distinguish actual world and hypo-
thetical world events. Because all verbs in the pre-
vious guideline are regarded as events, verbs of 
hypothetical world events are also included in the 
events. For example: (the italicized words in our 
examples indicate verbs) 
 (a) ???/??/?/??/??/?? (after 
the industrial estate was established, it at-
tracted a great deal of foreign capital) 
 (b) ???/??/?/??/??/??/??
(after the industrial estate is established, it 
can attract a great deal of foreign capital) 
The difference between examples (a) and (b) is 
only with or without the word ??? (can)?, which 
governs a verb phrase and explains a possible 
situation. It should be noted that verbs in Chinese 
do not have morphological change. The complete 
meaning of verbs in the examples should consider 
the global context in the article. The example (a) 
explains an actual world event that the industrial 
estate attracted a great deal of foreign capital. 
However, in example (b), the word ??? (can)? 
changes  the phrase ???/??/?? (to attract a 
great deal of foreign capital)? into a hypothetical 
world event. This clause presents a possibility and 
does not indicate an event in the actual world.  
Considering the temporal relation between the 
verbs ???(establish)? and ???(attract)?,  the 
temporal relation in the example (a) means that  
the event ??(establish) occurs before the event 
??(attract). On the other hand, in the example 
(b), the verb ???(attract)? indicates a possibility. 
We cannot make sure if it could really happen. We 
regard that the temporal relation in the example (b) 
is unidentifiable. In the previous guideline, we re-
quest annotators to decide the temporal relation 
between them. However we do not classify the dif-
ference between actual and hypothetical worlds. 
The annotators annotate even some incomprehen-
sible temporal relations (such as the relation in ex-
ample (b)) with the tag ?unknown?. We clarify the 
issue by introducing event types to verbs.  
Aside form the problem of actual and hypotheti-
cal world events, verbs in our temporal relation 
annotated corpus still include some incomprehen-
sible events (We consider these in the next section). 
For solving these problems, we investigated differ-
ent types of events (verbs) in the Penn Chinese 
Treebank (Palmer, 2005) then give a clear classifi-
cation of event types. We use this classification of 
events to annotate events in the temporal relation 
tagged corpus. 
3 Event types of verbs 
Our criteria restrict events to verbs according to the 
POS-tag of Penn Chinese Treebank. Therefore, all 
the words tagged with the POS-tags (Xia, 2000), 
?VA?, ?VE?, ?VC?, and ?VV? are the ?event can-
didates?. However, these POS-tags include not 
only actual world events but also hypothetical 
world events, modifiers of nouns, and sub-
segments of named entities. We will exemplify 
these situations in this section. 
3.1 Verbs of actual world events 
The ?event? that we want to annotate is an action 
or situation that has happened or will definitely 
happen in the actual world. We define these events 
as actual world events. For example: 
 (c) ??/??/?? (A fire occurred in the 
market.) 
 (d) ???/??/??/??/?? (The 
construction work of the city hall will finish 
at the end of the year.) 
 (e) ??/??/??/?? (The function of 
financial market is smooth.)
The verbs in these examples represent actual 
world events. We want to distinguish between 
these events and hypothetical world events. 
The example (c) is a general instance of an ac-
tual world event. The verb ??? (happen)? in the 
33
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
sentence indicates an occurrence of an event. The 
verb ??? (finish)? in example (d) is a confirma-
tive result that definitely happens. The word ???
(will)? indicates that the sentence describes a fu-
ture statement. If there is no other statement that 
describes an accident event in the context, we can 
trust the event in the example (d) is an actual world 
event. 
In Chinese, an adjective can be a predicate with-
out a copula (corresponding to the verb ?be?). The 
example (e) contains no copula. Still, the adjective 
??? (smooth)? is a predicate and represents an 
actual world situation. This kind of adjective is the 
POS-tag ?VA? in Penn Chinese Treebank and also 
can represent an actual world event.  
3.2 Verbs of hypothetical world events 
Sometime verbs indicate hypothetical world events. 
In such situations, verbs describe a possibility, a 
statement of ability, anticipation, a request or an 
inconclusive future. For example: 
 (b) ???/??/?/??/??/??/??
(after the industrial estate is established, it 
can attract a great deal of foreign capital) 
 (g) ???/?/??/???? (A big oil 
tanker can berth at the new port) 
 (h) ?? /?? /?? /?? /?? /??
(They wish the government to legislate 
against affiliated bill) 
 (i) ??/??/??/??/?? (The gov-
ernment requires the factory to amend their 
equipments) 
 (j) ?/??/???/??/??/?? (this 
technology can help to develop a new kind 
of medicine) 
The verb ??? (attract)? in example (b) ex-
plains a possibility that ?may? occur after a con-
firmative result ??? (establish)? in future. We 
cannot decide the temporal relation between the 
actual world event ??? (establish)? and the pos-
sible event ??? (attract)? in the example (b), be-
cause we do not know if the event ??? (attract)? 
will realize. 
The verb ??? (berth)? in example (g) explains 
the capacity of the new port. The verb ???
(berth)? does not indicate truth or a confirmative 
result. We cannot confirm when an oil tanker will 
berth at the new port. This verb represents a hypo-
thetical world event. The verb ??? (legislate)? in 
the example (h) and the verb ???(amend)? in the 
example (i) explain a wish and a request. Even the 
sentences describe that the government (in the ex-
ample (h)) or the factory (in the example (i)) was 
required to do something; the descriptions do not 
show any evidence that the request will be exe-
cuted. Although the wish and request will be real-
ized in future, we cannot identify the time point of 
the realization of these events. Therefore we 
should consider that these verbs represent hypo-
thetical world events. 
The verb ??? (develop)? in the example (j) 
explains an inconclusive plan in future. The devel-
oped technology can be used for a new develop-
ment plan. However, we also cannot make sure if 
the development plan will be realized or not. We 
cannot identify the verb ??? (develop)? on a 
timeline. Since the verb represents a hypothetical 
world event. 
These examples (from the examples (b), (g) to 
(j)) indicate hypothetical world events. However, 
as we introduced in section 2.3 (the examples (a) 
and (b)), the instances with different types of 
events have the same context in local structure (the 
phrase ???/??/?? (to attract a great deal of 
foreign capital)?). The difference between the ex-
ample (a) and the example (b) is that the word ??
? (can)? exists or not. To distinguish an actual 
world event and a hypothetical world event with 
similar local context, the dependency structure 
analysis is quite helpful. 
3.3 Copula verbs  
There are two special POS-tags of verbs in Penn 
Chinese Treebank, VC and VE. These verbs are 
copulas in Chinese. The copula verb (such as the 
verb ?? (be)?) indicates existence and corre-
sponds to ?be? in English. In TimeML, these copu-
las are not considered as an independent verb. It is 
included in another verb phrase or in a nominal 
phrase that represents an event. However, the cop-
ula verb ?? (be)? is an independent verb in Penn 
Chinese Treebank. We should investigate how to 
deal with this copula verb. For example: 
 (k) ?/??/?/???/??/? (The older 
version of bill was legislated at three years 
ago.) 
34
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
 (l) ?/??/?/???/??/?/????
(The company is the largest electric power 
company in the world.) 
Considering the use of copula in Penn Chinese 
Treebank, sentences that include copula verbs can 
be distinguished to two types. The copula verbs 
describe existence. The existence could be a verb 
phrase (the example (k)) or a nominal phrase (the 
example (l)). In the example (k), the verb phrase 
????/?? (was legislated at three years ago)? 
represents an event that the copula verb accentu-
ates the existence of  the verb phrase. Although 
there are two verbs in the example (k), the sentence 
only includes an event which is the verb phrase 
????/?? (was legislated at three years ago)?.  
According to the dependency structure of sen-
tence, copula verbs represent the root of the de-
pendency structure and the head of a verb phrase 
that modifies a copula verb. We define a pair of a 
copula and a verb that modifies the copula as a 
?copula phrase?. Therefore we regard the copula 
verb in the example (k) as the main verb of the 
verb phrase ??? (legislate)? and it represents an 
actual world event1.
The copula verb ?? (be)? in the example (l) ac-
centuates the truth of the nominal phrase ????/
??/?/???? (the largest electric power com-
pany in the world)?. According to the discussion in 
the previous paragraph, the meaning of this copula 
comes from the nominal phrase. We can recognize 
the nominal phrase as a truth at the time point 
?NOW? (the company is largest in the world now). 
However, this phrase does not indicate any specific 
period of time that the fact holds. We can regard it 
as the background knowledge and it does not in-
clude an event. To identify the temporal relation 
between this noun phrase and other actual world 
event is impossible2. We also regard this copula 
verb as a hypothetical world event. 
3.4 Non-event verbs 
 
1 Whether the copula verbs are actual world events or hypo-
thetical world events depend on the modifier verb phrases. 
2 We cannot know when the company became the largest one 
on the world. And other events in the context distribute in a 
shorter period on a timeline. Therefore to compare the exis-
tence period of the truth and other events is impossible. How-
ever, if a temporal expression with a passed time period in the 
context, the truth could have a boundary of occurrence time. 
Then the copula can be recognized as an actual world event. 
There are several types of words that have a verbal 
POS-tag but do not represent events. These words 
include non-event predicative adjectives and 
named entities. 
In Chinese, adjectives can be predicates of a 
sentence without verbs. This kind of adjectives are 
predicative adjective and have a POS-tag ?VA? in 
Penn Chinese Treebank. These predicative adjec-
tives indicate situations. However, some instances 
in the Treebank are close to normal adjectives. We 
should distinguish the difference between the 
predicative adjectives that describe situations and 
predicative adjectives that are normal adjectives. 
For example: 
 (e) ??/??/??/?? (The function of 
financial market is smooth.)
 (n)?? /? /?/?? (To provide a new 
kind of power) 
The adjective ??? (smooth)? in the example 
(e) indicates a situation. We regard this adjective 
as an actual world event. However, the adjective 
?? (new)? in the example (n) is a modifier of the 
noun ??? (power)?. This adjective do not indi-
cate a situation, therefore it dose not represent an 
event. 
Another situation of non-event verbs is a verb in 
a named entity. Because of the strategy of the 
POS-tagging of Penn Chinese Treebank, a named 
entity is separated to several words and these 
words are tagged independently. For example: 
 (o) ???/??/??/?? (Alliance of 
Democratic Forces for Liberating Congo-
Zaire)? 
The example (o) shows a named entity that in-
cludes a word ??? (liberate)? has the POS-tag 
?VV?. However, this verb does not represent an 
actual event or a hypothetical event. It is a sub-
string of the named entity. We define this kind of 
verbs as non-event verbs. 
3.5 Attribute of event types 
Figure 2 summarizes the event types of verbs in 
section 3.1-3.4. We divide the verbs roughly into 
two types ?actual world? and ?hypothetical world?. 
Each type includes several sub-types. We annotate 
these two event types of verbs to our previous 
temporal relation annotated corpus. The definition 
of these event types in previous sections is a guide-
line for our annotators. This new attribute has two 
35
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
values ?actual world? and ?hypothetical world?. 
Although the types of values are coarse-grained, 
this attribute can describe whether a verb can be 
recognized as an event with understandable tempo-
ral relation on the timeline or not. 
However, the value ?hypothetical world? of the 
event types means not only that the verbs with this 
value are temporal relation un-recognizable events, 
but also that the verbs with this value are ?locally 
recognizable? events. For example: 
 (p) ??/??/??/??/??/?/??/
?? (They wish the government to in-
crease budget to repair the bank) 
The verb ??? (wish)? governs the verb phrase 
???/??/??/?/??/?? (the government 
increases budget to repair the bank)?. Therefore the 
verb phrase represents a hypothetical world event 
(because we do not know if the government will do 
it or not). However, considering the local context 
of the verb phrase, it includes two verbs that have a 
causal relation between them. The event ???
(increase)? should occur before the event ???
(repair)?3. The temporal relation between the two 
verbs exists in the local context. We do not ignore 
this kind of temporal relations and annotate them. 
The temporal relation between the verb ??? (in-
crease)? and the verb ??? (repair)? is not un-
known but the temporal relation between the verbs 
??? (increase)? and the verb ??? (wish)? is 
unknown. 
Therefore, we regard the attribute of event type 
as a ?bridge? between an actual world and a hypo-
thetical world. The event in the actual world means 
that we can identify the temporal relation between 
 
3 The government must increase the budget and pass the delib-
eration in the congress, and then the budget can be used to 
repair the bank. 
an event and the other occurred events in an actual 
world. The temporal relations between a hypo-
thetical world event and an actual world event can 
only be identified in a hypothetical world. Figure 3 
describes this concept. The index on each event 
indicates the linear ordering of the event mention 
in the article. The two events with rectangles rep-
resent the actual world and the four events with 
diamond shapes represent the hypothetical world. 
There is no understandable temporal relation be-
tween actual and hypothetical worlds (for example 
the relation between the event 1 and event 2). The 
events in hypothetical world have their temporal 
relation with other events in the same hypothetical 
world. However, a hypothetical world is independ-
ent to other hypothetical worlds. Therefore, the 
temporal relation between event 2 and event 3 un-
derstandable but the relation between event 3 and 
event 4 are unknown. We ask our annotators to 
annotate the understandable temporal relations in 
each hypothetical world because the instances of 
the local context are useful in analyzing the tempo-
ral relation between events in actual world by ma-
chine learning.

Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
After we manually annotate the event type of verbs 
on our temporal relation tagged corpus, we use 
support vector machines as machine learner to 
compose a temporal relation identifier. We per-
form an experiment to investigate the effect of the 
event type information.  
4.1 The data set 
We annotated a part of Penn Chinese Treebank 
with our previous criteria. The temporal relation 
tagged corpus includes 7520 verbs. Each verb has 
three types of temporal relation that we introduce 
in section 2.3. We annotate the event type informa-
tion manually and refine some ambiguous in-
stances. For efficiency, we introduce grouping on 
the temporal relation classes. Our criteria defined 
ten classes of temporal relation values. We com-
pose three types of temporal relation identifiers 
(RLP, RTA and RTP) and an event type classifier.  
To discriminate the event types of verbs, we add 
two possible values of temporal relations, the value 
?hypothetical? and ?copula-existence?. The value 
?hypothetical? is introduced in the temporal rela-
tion type ?RTA?. If the verb represents a hypo-
thetical world event or non-event, the verb is en-
closed into the hypothetical world. The verb in hy-
pothetical world cannot have a RLP relation (Rela-
tion of adjacent event pair) between hypothetical 
and actual worlds. However, for recognizing the 
verb that is the root event of the hypothetical world, 
we annotate the RTA relation (Relation of adjacent 
event pair) of the root event in hypothetical world 
as the value ?hypothetical?. The value ?copula-
existence? is introduced to annotate the event em-
phasized by the copula verb. If the copula verb 
governs a verb phrase with several verbs, the root 
event of the verb phrase has the value ?copula-
existence?. 
The possible values of three types of temporal 
relations and event types in our experiment are 
summarized as follows: 
 Event types: actual world and hypothetical 
world 
 RLP: after (includes the values ?after? and 
?begun-by? in our criteria), before (includes 
the values ?before? and ?end-by? in our cri-
teria), simultaneous, overlap (includes the 
values ?overlap?, ?overlapped-by?, ?in-
clude?, ?during? our criteria) 
 RTA: after, before, simultaneous, overlap, 
unknown, copula-existence, hypothetical 
 RTP: after, before, simultaneous, overlap 
The training data for SVMs includes 151 articles 
with 49620 words and 7520 verbs and the testing 
data is collected from articles in Penn Chinese 
Treebank other than training data (testing data in-
cludes 50 short articles with 5010 words and 732 
verbs). The basic information of our corpus and the 
distribution of the value of attributes in our training 
and testing data are shown in Table 1. It should be 
noted that the number of the attributes of the data 
ignore some negligible instances. Such as, if a verb 
does not have sibling verbs in the dependency 
structure, to consider the attribute ?RTP (Relation 
between focus event and its sibling event)? is un-
necessary. Therefore the total numbers of the at-
tribute ?RTA? and the attribute ?RTP? are less 
than the number of all verbs. 
4.2 Experiment 
We train each classifier (event types, RLP, RTA 
and RTP) by an independent model. The features 
for machine learning are also tuned independently. 
We evaluate the accuracy of automatic annotation 
of event types and temporal relations with and 
without our event types. We use our event type tag 
as a feature of the three temporal relations. Other 
features for SVM analyzer to annotate the three 
types of temporal relations include the morpho-
logical information of the focus event pair and the 
dependency structure of the sentence. These fea-
tures can be extracted from the dependency struc-
tures automatically. 
The results are shown in Table 2. The abbrevia-
tions ?R?, ?P? and ?F? mean ?Recall?, ?Precision? 
and ?F-measure?. The row ?Accuracy w/o event 
type? means the results of the temporal relations 
annotating without using the event type as a feature. 
Other rows use the event type which is annotated

Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
by a machine learning-based analyzer as a feature. 
Because there is no similar related research that 
analyzes temporal relation between Chinese verbs 
based on machine learning, we cannot make any 
comparison. We discuss the accuracy of temporal 
relation annotating with and without using our 
event type according to the result of our experi-
ment.  
4.2 Discussions 
Table 2 shows that the model with the result of the 
event type classifier is better than that without us-
ing the result of the event type classifier. However, 
the improvement of using event types is limited. 
The reason might be the accuracy of event type is 
as low as 83%. To improve the performance of 
event type annotation helps to improve the relation 
annotation. 
There is no research based on the same data set 
and corpus guideline, therefore we can not com-
pare the result to other research. However, in the 
shared task: ?TempEval4 Temporal Relation Identi-
fication? (Verhagen, 2007), the task ?temporal re-
lations between matrix verbs? resembles the goal 
of our corpus. The F-measure in TempEval shared 
task distribute between 40%~50%. The result of 
the shared task also shows the difficulty of auto-
matic temporal relation analysis. 
5 Conclusions  and future directions 
We propose a machine learning-based temporal 
relation identification method. This is the first 
work of the temporal relation identification be-
tween verbs in Chinese texts. To deal with the de-
ficiency in our previous temporal relation annotat-
 
4 This shared task deals with English news articles.(TimeBank 
1.2)  
ing criteria, we newly introduce the event types of 
Chinese verb. The result of evaluation experiments 
shows that the event type information helps to im-
prove the accuracy of the identifier.  
A deficient of our experiment is that we do not 
use semantic information as features for machine 
learner. Semantic information of temporal and 
event expressions is important for recognizing 
temporal relations between events. As a future re-
search, we would like to introduce causal relation 
knowledge of verbs (this is similar to VerbOcean 
(Chklovski, 2004)). We are collecting this kind of 
verb pairs and expect that this causal relation helps 
to improve the performance of automatic annota-
tion.
