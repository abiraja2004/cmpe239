Abstract 
A variety of approaches to annotating 
reference in corpora have been 
adopted. This paper reviews four 
approaches to the annotation of 
reference in corpora. Following this 
we present a variety of results from 
one annotated corpus, the UCREL 
anaphoric treebank, relevant to 
automated reference resolution. 
Introduction 
The application of corpora to the problems of 
pronoun resolution is a rapidly growing area of 
corpus linguistics. Work by Dagan and Itai 
(1990) and Mitkov (1994, 1995, 1996; Mitkov, 
Choi and Sharp 1995) are good examples of 
this growth. However, the application of 
suitably annotated corpora to the problem of 
pronoun resolution has been largely hampered 
to date by a lack of availability of suitable 
corpus resources. This paper is going to review 
what work has been undertaken in the 
production of corpora including discourse 
annotations. We will then show what 
quantitative data is available from such corpora 
which can be of use in the construction of 
robust pronoun resolution systems. 
Corpus Annotation 
While an increasingly wide range of linguistic 
analyses (both automatically and manually 
produced) are becoming available as 
annotations in corpora, morphosyntactically 
annotated corpora have long been available, 
and syntactically annotated corpora are now 
becoming more readily available too. 
Examples include the parsed LOB corpus, the 
Susanne corpus (Sampson, 1995) and the Penn 
Treebanks. While it is widely perceived that 
appropriately annotated corpus data is of 
importance in the study of reference resolution, 
corpora which include appropriate discourse 
annotations have not become more readily 
available in the public domain, however. 
Evidence for the growing appreciation of the 
importance of anaphorically annotated corpora 
can be seen in the slow but sure growth of a 
range of corpus annotation systems for 
reference annotation in the 1990s - Fligelstone 
(1992), Aone and Bennett (1994), Botley 
(1996), de Rocha (1997) and Gaizauskas and 
Humphries (1997). Yet while the proposals for 
an appropriately annotated corpus are growing, 
there is little corpus data available in Englishk 
The only corpus that is available, developed by 
Aone and Bennett, has a variety of 
shortcomings - it covers only one genre of 
written language (newspaper articles), it deals 
only with anaphora, it is a corpus of Japanese 
and Spanish 2, and its annotations were not 
produced to meet the need of a wide range of 
end-users, only participants in the fifth message 
understanding competition. Hence the work 
which has been undertaken with corpora in the 
field of reference resolution has not been able 
to exploit and evaluate the type of reliable 
quantitative data that an anaphorically 
annotated corpus could yield. 
Our aim at Lancaster over the past three years 
has been to develop a series of tools to retrieve 
quantitative data on a range of reference 
features in text. We have done this on the basis 
of one corpus which was developed in 
collaboration with IBM Yorktown Heights, and 
a second which we have developed in-house. 
Neither of these corpora are available for 
general release because of restrictions placed 
upon us by the providers of the corpus text. 
What we can release, however, are the results 
It should be noted that other languages have 
already started to generate such resources - Aone 
and Bennett (1994) have been working on such a 
corpus for Japanese and Spanish. 
2 Aone and Bennett (1994:74) appreciate he 
importance of extending this work to English.

of our mining of the corpus for quantitative 
data. This is the first publication aimed at the 
release of such information. 
The uses to which such information may be put 
in anaphor resolution are obvious. Using 
quantitative data of this sort may be one means 
of providing "knowledge poor" reference 
resolution. Also, as McEnery (1995) suggests, 
such quantitative data may be used to provide a 
more restricted search area for knowledge 
intensive anaphor esolution systems to work 
in. We believe that the data we present later in 
this paper shows clearly, for one text type at 
least, that the use of quantitative data to limit 
the search space of a reference resolution 
algorithm is a possibility. 
Before we present any such data, however, we 
will review the limited body of work that exists 
in the 
field of reference resolution-oriented 
annotation i  corpus linguistics. In doing so we 
will cover two schemes developed at Lancaster 
University (Botley, 1996, Fligelstone, 1992), 
and two further schemes developed at Sheffield 
and Sussex Universities (Gaizauskas and 
Humphries, 1997, de Rocha, 1997). This type 
of review is of interest because it shows the 
range of features that may be annotated in such 
a corpus, and consequently gives a sense of the 
type of quantitative data we may hope to 
extract from an appropriately annotated corpus. 
Press Newswire stories, and was developed as 
part of a collaborative project between UCREL 
and IBM Yorktown Heights (Garside, 1993). 
The treebank is marked up using the 
IBM/UCREL discourse annotation scheme 
(Fligelstone, 1992). This scheme encodes a 
wide range of anaphoric and cohesive features 
based on the typology of Halliday and Hasan 
(1976). Each feature is associated with 
annotation symbols which encode the type of 
relationship involved, and the direction of 
reference, where relevant. 
In addition to these features, it is possible to 
mark uncertainty (of direction of reference, or 
of the antecedent), multiple antecedents, and 
semantic values on second and third-person 
pronouns. For a more detailed treatment of the 
annotation scheme, see Fligelstone (1992). 
The UCREL discourse annotation scheme was 
applied to corpus texts using a tailor-built 
editing tool, called XANADU (Garside, 1993). 
XANADU is an interactive tool which allows 
an analyst to rapidly introduce cohesion 
annotations into corpus texts. The tool was 
developed as part of the above-mentioned 
collaborative project between UCREL and 
IBM Yorktown Heights (Garside, 1993: 5-27). 
Evaluation of the UCREL 
annotation scheme 
Work to Date 
Having established that a range of annotation 
schemes are being developed to encode 
anaphoric reference resolution in corpora, we 
need to review this work here. We need to 
review it because in doing so one gains a 
flavour of the types of quantitative data that 
may become available in the near future from 
the fruit of such efforts. When we have 
completed our review of four important 
annotation schemes, we will go in and look in 
some detail at the type of data forthcoming 
from corpora annotated by one scheme, the 
Lancaster scheme, and assess its potential 
impact upon practical, robust knowledge poor 
anaphor resolution. 
The UCREL Anaphoric Treebank 
This treebank consists of 100,000 words of 
morphosyntactically-annotated Associated 
The UCREL annotation scheme scores very 
highly in terms of granularity of analysis - it is 
possible to mark a wide range of cohesive 
phenomena using the scheme. This means that 
it is possible to provide a corpus resource 
which is very rich in data that could be useful 
to an algorithm for resolving anaphora. 
However, one area of weakness is that it only 
works effectively when marking antecedents 
that are surface linguistic strings, such as noun 
phrases and clauses. It has been found, 
especially by Francis (Francis, 1994 as well as 
Botley (Botley, 1996) that some antecedents 
are indirectly related to their anaphors. One 
example of this is where demonstrative 
anaphors function to encapsulate or label 
(Francis, 1994) a large stretch of preceding 
discourse. Using the existing UCREL 
annotation scheme, the only way of marking 
such a feature would be to place antecedent 
annotations around the entire previous text. 
While it is possible to do this for situations 
where an antecedent is a single sentence, it is 
far from certain how to mark an antecedent that 
68 
is not a clearly identifiable surface element of 
the text. Therefore, this class of 'indirect 
anaphors' are not easily markable using the 
UCREL scheme. Despite this limitation, it is 
still eminently feasible to mark surface 
antecedents. 
De Rocha's Work. 
In a notation scheme developed by Marco de 
Rocha (de Rocha, 1997), spoken corpus texts 3 
in English and Portuguese are segmented and 
annotated according to the topic structure of 
the texts analysed. This approach reflects the 
widely-accepted view in discourse analysis and 
text linguistics that the topic of the discourse 4
tends to be the preferred antecedent for a given 
anaphoric expression. Therefore, de Rocha's 
annotation is aimed at exploring the complex 
relationships between anaphora nd discourse 
topic. 
Firstly, de Rocha establishes, for each 
discourse fragment under analysis, a global 
topic, or discourse topic. The discourse topic 
can be valid throughout a whole text, or may 
change at different points, in which case, a new 
discourse topic will be established and 
annotated. The discourse topic is annotated 
above the text fragment as a noun phrase 
within asterisks. The next step is to divide the 
text into discourse segments according to local 
topic continuity. This is done by assigning a 
segment topic, which is only valid throughout 
a given segment of the discourse. Whenever 
the local topic changes, a new segment topic is 
assigned, and appropriate annotation is inserted 
manually into the text. Segment opics are 
annotated using the letter s, followed by an 
index number, similar to those assigned using 
the UCREL scheme. 
Segments where further local topic shift occurs 
are further subdivided into subsegments, with 
their own appropriate annotation, consisting of 
the string ss, followed by an index number as 
with segment annotations. Also, topics which 
have been dropped, but have been re- 
introduced in the conversation are also marked 
by adding the letter r to the s or ss annotations 
for discourse segments. 
3 de Rocha used extracts from the London-Lund 
Corpus for his English data. 
4 Topic is known by various terms in the literature, 
for instance focus (Sidner, 1986) or center (Mitkov, 
1994b). 
As well as the above segment and subsegment 
annotations, de Rocha's scheme allows for 
discourse segments to be annotated according 
to the discourse function they serve, for 
instance 'introduce the discourse topic' is 
annotated using the string intro_dt. Also, each 
annotation string contains a short phrase 
describing the current opic for the segment or 
subsegment under analysis. 
The final stage in de Rocha's analytical 
framework is to annotate ach case of anaphora 
that take place within the discourse segments 
identified. This is done by specifying four 
properties of anaphora: 
!. type of anaphora, such as 'subject pronoun' 
or 'full noun phrase', with each type having its 
own tag, 
2. type of antecedent, defined as either 
implicit or explicit, each of which is tagged 
separately in the annotation, 
3. topicality status of the antecedent, in other 
words whether the antecedent is the discourse 
topic, segment topic or subsegment topic. 
4. processing slot, by which anaphora cases 
can be classified according to the type of 
knowledge used in processing them, such as 
syntactic, collocational or discourse 
knowledge. 
Evaluation of de Rocha's 
annotation scheme. 
De Rocha's scheme has a number of 
innovations. Primarily, it goes beyond 
annotating anaphoric cases in texts, and 
attempts to encode information about the 
relationship between anaphora nd topicality in 
discourse, which goes a long way towards 
providing annotated corpora that can be used in 
studies of discourse structure and anaphora. 
Secondly, rather than simply identifying 
anaphors and antecedents, it classifies them 
according to some rigorous criteria which are 
more detailed than the framework laid down by 
Halliday and Hasan, which was at the core of 
the UCREL scheme. Thirdly, de Rocha's 
scheme is developed for use with spoken 
dialogues in more than one language, which 
introduces extra analytical dimensions to the 
corpus-based analysis of anaphora. And 
finally, de Rocha introduces information 
concerning the kind of knowledge used in 
processing anaphors, which is not included in 
other schemes, but would be very useful in any 
research that marries corpus-based description 
with a knowledge-based approach to anaphor 
resolution. 
69 
The main disadvantage to de Rocha's scheme 
is that it does not use a widely-accepted text 
encoding format in its annotation symbols, a 
requirement hat is becoming increasingly 
important in modern corpus-based research. 
The next anaphoric annotation system to be 
described here does do this, however.

Function and Antecedent Type. 
Each case of demonstrative anaphora in a 
300,000 word corpus 5 was annotated with a 
five-character tag which encoded each of the 
above values for each of the five features 
identified. 
Evaluation of Botley's annotation 
scheme. 
Gaizauskas and Humphries (1997) use SGML 
(Standard Generalised Markup Language) tags 
to annotate anaphoric expressions in texts used 
in a coreference resolution task. SGML is 
becoming a widely-recognised standard for 
encoding electronic texts for interchange 
between different computer systems in natural 
language ngineering research. 
Evaluation of Gaizauskas and 
Humphries' annotation 
This system has the main advantage of being in 
a widely-recognised text interchange format. 
However, it only allows a small subset of 
anaphoric relations to be marked, in this case, 
reference involving 'it'. Also, the scheme was 
developed for use in a rigidly restricted 
automatic resolution task where the success of 
each annotation had to be measured. It was not 
developed for use on a large corpus-based 
project, as with other annotation schemes 
described in this chapter. Despite this, 
however, the SGML framework does provide a 
useful starting point by which other schemes 
may be converted to SGML in the future. 
Botley's Annotation Scheme 
The final annotation scheme to be described 
here was developed by Simon Botley (Botley, 
1996), and, like that of de Rocha, attempts to 
classify anaphoric expressions according to 
various external criteria. Botley's scheme was 
developed to describe the different ways in 
which demonstrative expressions function 
anaphorically in written and spoken corpus 
texts. Essentially, Botley classifies 
demonstrative anaphors according to five 
distinctive features, each of which can have 
one of a series of values: Recoverability of 
Antecedent ( he extent o which the antecedent 
is a recoverable surface string), Direction of 
Reference, Phoric Type (derived from 
Like de Rocha, Botley's scheme has the 
advantage of being able to mark a great deal 
more information about anaphoric phenomena 
in the text than the UCREL scheme at present 
can. Also, it is relatively straightforward to 
derive statistics concerning frequency of 
occurrence of particular demonstrative f atures 
using the Botley scheme, from which 
sophisticated statistical modelling can be 
carried out. Also, the Indirectly Recoverable 
value allows analysts to home in on areas of 
demonstrative anaphora which are worthy of 
further study. It was mentioned above that the 
UCREL scheme cannot provide much 
information about those cases of anaphora 
where the antecedent is not an identifiable 
surface noun phrase. However, schemes which 
classify antecedents according to directness or 
indirectness of recoverability (Botley) or 
explicitness versus implicitness (de Rocha) are 
highly valuable and sensitive tools which can 
help analysts to derive richer descriptions of 
particular anaphoric features in a corpus. 
Findings to Date 
Having reviewed the work undertaken on 
reference oriented corpus annotation to date, 
we can now present a few examples of the type 
of data that we have extracted from the 
anaphoric treebanks held at Lancaster. It 
should be emphasised that the data we are 
presenting here is but a sample of the data we 
have 6, which will be presented fully in Tanaka 
(1998) and Botley (forthcoming). \[NOTE: 
need to say how many anaphors were detected 
here\] The data all refers to the genre of 
newswire reporting, using the anaphofic 
treebank described above. Yet in presenting

these samples of data we believe that we are 
showing at least two things. Firstly, that 
existing quantitatively oriented studies of 
reference in English are generally supportable, 
as far as they go, by reference to corpus data. 
Secondly, and more importantly, it is possible 
to go beyond the bounds of existing studies, 
and provide relevant quantitative data that is 
not currently available.

Key to table: A is numbers of intervening 
sentence boundaries, B is number of 
occurrences, C is rate of occurrences, D is the 
sum of occurrences to that point and E is rate 
of sum. 
Let us begin with the first case. Ariel (1988) 
found a relatively normal distribution for 
distance between anaphor and antecedent in the 
data she observed. We have tried a variety of 
distance measures (intervening NPs, 
intervening words, intervening sentences) and 
found a very similar distribution in all cases. 
Table Two and Figure Five below show, in 
detail and graphically, how sentence distance 
shows the behaviour of anaphors. 
The data in itself is quite remarkable, and 
shows a variety of points clearly. First, the 
preoccupation with intra-sentential anaphora in 
generative linguistics is shown to be unhealthy. 
Intra-sentential naphora is shown to be the 
minority case in this data. Most anaphors in the 
data sample are inter-sentential. Any anaphor 
resolution system which dwells upon intra- 
sentential anaphora at the expense of inter- 
sentential anaphora is doomed to failure. 
Second, the behaviour of the anaphors is 
remarkably uniform. In practical terms, if you 
accepted that you were prepared to limit your 
search for an antecedent five sentences distant 
from an anaphor, then although you would be 
placing an upper limit on the accuracy of your 
algorithm of 94.92%, you would be receiving a
bonus, in a reduction of some 75% of the 
potential relevant search space. If we assume 
that with an increased search space accuracy 
declines, then quantitatively motivated 
limitations such as that suggested may boost 
the success rate of a knowledge intensive 
system which suffers from declining accuracy 
and speed with an open ended search space. 
Third, the majority of anaphors are either inter- 
sentential, or occur in the previous sentence. 
Admittedly, this observation only covers 
around 75% of cases, but nonetheless, it is 
indicative of the type of probabilistic 
information that may be incorporated into 
search algorithms to aid with selection of an 
antecedent - if there is no case to choose on 
rational grounds between an antecedent five 
sentences away and one in the previous 
sentence, the one in the previous sentence is 
fundamentally more likely to be the right one. 
Let us now move to our second point - using 
annotated corpora to derive quantitative data 
not available currently. When we look at the 
analysis above, and studies such as Ariel 
(1988), there is a great deal that this simple 
distance oriented type of analysis does not 
show. Do all of the anaphors have the same 
pattern of distribution, for instance? It may be 
that this averaging of distances as shown in 
table one looks quite different when it is 
broken down by anaphor. Also, how do 
features other than distance influence reference 
resolution - for example, how do pronouns in 
direct quotations behave? Do they have 
antecedents beyond the scope of the quotation 
itself?

The ways in which we have elaborated the 
analysis presented above are numerous. But for 
the purpose of showing briefly and succinctly 
the reasons why we may want to do a more 
detailed analysis of our data, see Table 2 
below. In this table, we have analysed sentence 
distance for each pronoun, both within direct 
speech (line "in DS") and outside direct 
speech. For purposes of presentation we have 
limited the distance to 14 sentences, though as 
noted previously, a few antecedents lie beyond 
this range. In the following table, each pronoun 
has two entries. On the first line, the total 
number of occurrences of each pronoun are 
given in each of the distance categories 
represented. The second line gives the total 
number of occurrences of each pronoun 
appearing in direct speech in each distance 
category represented. 
Looking at this table, it is clear that all 
pronouns do not act alike, and further, that the 
determination of whether a pronoun is in direct 
speech or not can be of great practical 
relevance. Most 7 first and second person 
pronouns (I, my, me, myself, we, our, us, 
ourselves, you, yours) only ever occur within 
direct speech in this genre. On examination of 
the text, their antecedent almost invariably lies 
beyond the direct quotation itself. 
Consequently, it is noticeable that these 
pronouns tend to have longer distance ties than 
the third person pronouns, as the quotation 
itself has been included within the distance 
measure. If we look, for instance, at references 
occurring at a distance of six sentences, I, we, 
us and you occurring in direct speech account 
for ten of the thirteen cases (the remainder 
being one each of he, his and they, of which 
only his occurs in direct speech). 
Overall, the predominant endency is still 
towards very short range reference - with most 
antecedents being within one sentence of the 
anaphor. There are a very few cases of 
pronouns with a more substantial tail than 
others - 6.1% of the 504 cases of I observed 
had an antecedent at two sentences distance, 
compared, say to the 213 cases of its, which 
has no antecedents more than one sentence 
distant, and which only had 1.9% (4 cases) at 1 
sentence distance.. 
7 In our discussion here, we will use the raw 
freqeuncy data from the tables as the basis of our 
discussion. A more exacting statistical nalysis of 
the type of data we present here is given in 
Tanaka(1998) and Botley (forthcoming). 
While the overall characterisation f distance 
suggests that the most populous category of 
references is intra-sentential followed by 
references one sentence distant, this pattern is 
not true for all pronouns. While there is no 
pronoun observed that prefers antecedents at 
two or more sentences distant over those 
occurring within the same sentence, there are 
anaphors which prefer an antecedent in the 
previous sentence over an antecedent in the 
same sentence, adding further weight to our 
observation that ignoring inter-sentential 
anaphora is not an option. I, me, we, us, you 
and she prefer an antecedent at one sentence 
distance; intra-sentential naphora does not 
seem to be the norm for these anaphors. 
In other words, given different pronouns and 
different circumstances, there are variations in 
the behaviour of pronouns. Although we are 
only reporting on one genre here, the work of 
Botley (1996) looking at determiners in three 
genres, suggest hat genre is another dimension 
of variation where we may see significant 
differences in the pattern of distributions of 
pronouns across various distance measures. 
Conclusion 
The point of our investigations are to 
illuminate a variety of features that corpus 
based pronoun resolution systems may benefit 
by, and which they must certainly be aware of: 
1. Pronoun antecedents do exhibit clear 
quantitative patterns of distribution 
2. Genre may influence those patterns 
3. Direct speech is an important factor in 
explaining some of those patterns 
4. Inter sentential pronoun resolution is 
not always the norm 
5. Some patterns of pronoun antecedent 
distribution are prone to longer tails 
than others 
6. Characterisation of pronoun 
distributions based on all pronouns 
distorts the picture which may be 
observed on the individual pronoun 
level 
An obvious criticism of our work to date is that 
we have not based a pronoun resolution system 
upon the data that we have extracted from our 
corpus (although Tanaka, 1998 does include a 
report on such a system). The reason we have 
not done so, is that we are far from convinced 
that the right corpus resources and the right 
73 
type of quantitative data are currently 
available. As we produce more and more 
refined data from our corpus, we are seeing 
patterns of distribution which are masked in 
more general representations of the data, as we 
have exemplified. Also, we are only able to 
produce this data for a severely limited genre 
of written texts. What we need to do next is 
work towards a balanced corpus, including 
both written and spoken language, which 
would allow us to extract quantitative data 
similar to that shown in this paper, for a wide 
range of text types and for spoken language. 
Our experience to date indicates that while we 
may observe patterns of usage which are of use 
and of importance to robust pronoun 
resolution, that data should at least be extracted 
on a by genre basis. The compilation of such 
data is our next research aim.
