Abstract
An important challenge to statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) is the lack of par-
allel data for many language pairs. One
common solution is to pivot through a
third language for which there exist par-
allel corpora with the source and target
languages. Although pivoting is a robust
technique, it introduces some low quality
translations. In this paper, we present two
language-independent features to improve
the quality of phrase-pivot based SMT.
The features, source connectivity strength
and target connectivity strength reflect the
quality of projected alignments between
the source and target phrases in the pivot
phrase table. We show positive results (0.6
BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT as
a case study.
1 Introduction
One of the main issues in statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) is the scarcity of parallel data for
many language pairs especially when the source
and target languages are morphologically rich. A
common SMT solution to the lack of parallel data
is to pivot the translation through a third language
(called pivot or bridge language) for which there
exist abundant parallel corpora with the source
and target languages. The literature covers many
pivoting techniques. One of the best performing
techniques, phrase pivoting (Utiyama and Isahara,
2007), builds an induced new phrase table between
the source and target. One of the main issues of
this technique is that the size of the newly cre-
ated pivot phrase table is very large (Utiyama and
Isahara, 2007). Moreover, many of the produced
phrase pairs are of low quality which affects the
translation choices during decoding and the over-
all translation quality. In this paper, we introduce
language independent features to determine the
quality of the pivot phrase pairs between source
and target. We show positive results (0.6 BLEU
points) on Persian-Arabic SMT.
Next, we briefly discuss some related work. We
then review two common pivoting strategies and
how we use them in Section 3. This is followed by
our approach to using connectivity strength fea-
tures in Section 4. We present our experimental
results in Section 5.
2 Related Work
Many researchers have investigated the use of piv-
oting (or bridging) approaches to solve the data
scarcity issue (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and
Wang, 2009; Khalilov et al, 2008; Bertoldi et al,
2008; Habash and Hu, 2009). The main idea is to
introduce a pivot language, for which there exist
large source-pivot and pivot-target bilingual cor-
pora. Pivoting has been explored for closely re-
lated languages (Hajic? et al, 2000) as well as un-
related languages (Koehn et al, 2009; Habash and
Hu, 2009). Many different pivot strategies have
been presented in the literature. The following
three are perhaps the most common.
The first strategy is the sentence translation
technique in which we first translate the source
sentence to the pivot language, and then translate
the pivot language sentence to the target language
412
(Khalilov et al, 2008).
The second strategy is based on phrase pivot-
ing (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Cohn and Lap-
ata, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2009). In phrase pivot-
ing, a new source-target phrase table (translation
model) is induced from source-pivot and pivot-
target phrase tables. Lexical weights and transla-
tion probabilities are computed from the two trans-
lation models.
The third strategy is to create a synthetic source-
target corpus by translating the pivot side of
source-pivot corpus to the target language using an
existing pivot-target model (Bertoldi et al, 2008).
In this paper, we build on the phrase pivoting
approach, which has been shown to be the best
with comparable settings (Utiyama and Isahara,
2007). We extend phrase table scores with two
other features that are language independent.
Since both Persian and Arabic are morphologi-
cally rich, we should mention that there has been
a lot of work on translation to and from morpho-
logically rich languages (Yeniterzi and Oflazer,
2010; Elming and Habash, 2009; El Kholy and
Habash, 2010a; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Kathol
and Zheng, 2008). Most of these efforts are fo-
cused on syntactic and morphological processing
to improve the quality of translation.
To our knowledge, there hasn?t been a lot of
work on Persian and Arabic as a language pair.
The only effort that we are aware of is based
on improving the reordering models for Persian-
Arabic SMT (Matusov and Ko?pru?, 2010).
3 Pivoting Strategies
In this section, we review the two pivoting strate-
gies that are our baselines. We also discuss how
we overcome the large expansion of source-to-
target phrase pairs in the process of creating a
pivot phrase table.
3.1 Sentence Pivoting
In sentence pivoting, English is used as an inter-
face between two separate phrase-based MT sys-
tems; Persian-English direct system and English-
Arabic direct system. Given a Persian sentence,
we first translate the Persian sentence from Per-
sian to English, and then from English to Arabic.
3.2 Phrase Pivoting
In phrase pivoting (sometimes called triangulation
or phrase table multiplication), we train a Persian-
to-Arabic and an English-Arabic translation mod-
els, such as those used in the sentence pivoting
technique. Based on these two models, we induce
a new Persian-Arabic translation model.
Since we build our models on top of Moses
phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al, 2007), we need
to provide the same set of phrase translation prob-
ability distributions.1 We follow Utiyama and Isa-
hara (2007) in computing the probability distribu-
tions. The following are the set of equations used
to compute the lexical probabilities (?) and the
phrase probabilities (pw)
?(f |a) =?
e
?(f |e)?(e|a)
?(a|f) =?
e
?(a|e)?(e|f)
pw(f |a) =
?
e
pw(f |e)pw(e|a)
pw(a|f) =
?
e
pw(a|e)pw(e|f)
where f is the Persian source phrase. e is
the English pivot phrase that is common in both
Persian-English translation model and English-
Arabic translation model. a is the Arabic target
phrase.
We also build a Persian-Arabic reordering table
using the same technique but we compute the re-
ordering weights in a similar manner to Henriquez
et al (2010).
As discussed earlier, the induced Persian-
Arabic phrase and reordering tables are very large.
Table 1 shows the amount of parallel corpora
used to train the Persian-English and the English-
Arabic and the equivalent phrase table sizes com-
pared to the induced Persian-Arabic phrase table.2
We introduce a basic filtering technique dis-
cussed next to address this issue and present some
baseline experiments to test its performance in
Section 5.3.
3.3 Filtering for Phrase Pivoting
The main idea of the filtering process is to select
the top [n] English candidate phrases for each Per-
sian phrase from the Persian-English phrase ta-
ble and similarly select the top [n] Arabic target
phrases for each English phrase from the English-
Arabic phrase table and then perform the pivot-
ing process described earlier to create a pivoted

phrase translation probabilities.

Persian-Arabic phrase table. To select the top can-
didates, we first rank all the candidates based on
the log linear scores computed from the phrase
translation probabilities and lexical weights mul-
tiplied by the optimized decoding weights then we
pick the top [n] pairs.
We compare the different pivoting strategies
and various filtering thresholds in Section 5.3.
4 Approach
One of the main challenges in phrase pivoting is
the very large size of the induced phrase table.
It becomes even more challenging if either the
source or target language is morphologically rich.
The number of translation candidates (fanout) in-
creases due to ambiguity and richness (discussed
in more details in Section 5.2) which in return
increases the number of combinations between
source and target phrases. Since the only criteria
of matching between the source and target phrase
is through a pivot phrase, many of the induced
phrase pairs are of low quality. These phrase pairs
unnecessarily increase the search space and hurt
the overall quality of translation.
To solve this problem, we introduce two
language-independent features which are added to
the log linear space of features in order to deter-
mine the quality of the pivot phrase pairs. We call
these features connectivity strength features.
Connectivity Strength Features provide two
scores, Source Connectivity Strength (SCS) and
Target Connectivity Strength (TCS). These two
scores are similar to precision and recall metrics.
They depend on the number of alignment links be-
tween words in the source phrase to words of the
target phrase. SCS and TSC are defined in equa-
tions 1 and 2 where S = {i : 1 ? i ? S} is the
set of source words in a given phrase pair in the
pivot phrase table and T = {j : 1 ? j ? T}
is the set of the equivalent target words. The
word alignment between S and T is defined as
A = {(i, j) : i ? S and j ? T }.
SCS = |A||S| (1)
TCS = |A||T | (2)
We get the alignment links by projecting the
alignments of source-pivot to the pivot-target
phrase pairs used in pivoting. If the source-target
phrase pair are connected through more than one
pivot phrase, we take the union of the alignments.
In contrast to the aggregated values represented
in the lexical weights and the phrase probabilities,
connectivity strength features provide additional
information by counting the actual links between
the source and target phrases. They provide an
independent and direct approach to measure how
good or bad a given phrase pair are connected.
Figure 1 and 2 are two examples (one good, one
bad) Persian-Arabic phrase pairs in a pivot phrase
table induced by pivoting through English.3 In the
first example, each Persian word is aligned to an
Arabic word. The meaning is preserved in both
phrases which is reflected in the SCS and TCS
scores. In the second example, only one Persian
word in aligned to one Arabic word in the equiv-
alent phrase and the two phrases conveys two dif-
ferent meanings. The English phrase is not a good
translation for either, which leads to this bad pair-
ing. This is reflected in the SCS and TCS scores.
5 Experiments
In this section, we present a set of baseline ex-
periments including a simple filtering technique to
overcome the huge expansion of the pivot phrase
table. Then we present our results in using connec-
tivity strength features to improve Persian-Arabic
pivot translation quality.

5.1 Experimental Setup
In our pivoting experiments, we build two SMT
models. One model to translate from Persian to
English and another model to translate from En-
glish to Arabic. The English-Arabic parallel cor-
pus is about 2.8M sentences (?60M words) avail-
able from LDC4 and GALE5 constrained data. We
use an in-house Persian-English parallel corpus of
about 170K sentences and 4M words.
Word alignment is done using GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003). For Arabic language model-
ing, we use 200M words from the Arabic Giga-
word Corpus (Graff, 2007) together with the Ara-
bic side of our training data. We use 5-grams
for all language models (LMs) implemented us-
ing the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). For En-
glish language modeling, we use English Giga-
word Corpus with 5-gram LM using the KenLM
toolkit (Heafield, 2011).
All experiments are conducted using the Moses
phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al, 2007).
We use MERT (Och, 2003) for decoding weight

optimization. For Persian-English translation
model, weights are optimized using a set 1000 sen-
tences randomly sampled from the parallel cor-
pus while the English-Arabic translation model
weights are optimized using a set of 500 sen-
tences from the 2004 NIST MT evaluation test
set (MT04). The optimized weights are used for
ranking and filtering (discussed in Section 3.3).
We use a maximum phrase length of size 8
across all models. We report results on an in-
house Persian-Arabic evaluation set of 536 sen-
tences with three references. We evaluate using
BLEU-4 (Papineni et al, 2002) and METEOR
(Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).
5.2 Linguistic Preprocessing
In this section we present our motivation and
choice for preprocessing Arabic, Persian, English
data. Both Arabic and Persian are morphologi-
cally complex languages but they belong to two
different language families. They both express
richness and linguistic complexities in different
ways.
One aspect of Arabic?s complexity is its vari-
ous attachable clitics and numerous morphologi-
cal features (Habash, 2010). We follow El
Kholy and Habash (2010a) and use the PATB to-
kenization scheme (Maamouri et al, 2004) in our
415
experiments. We use MADA v3.1 (Habash and
Rambow, 2005; Habash et al, 2009) to tokenize
the Arabic text. We only evaluate on detokenized
and orthographically correct (enriched) output fol-
lowing the work of El Kholy and Habash (2010b).
Persian on the other hand has a relatively sim-
ple nominal system. There is no case system and
words do not inflect with gender except for a few
animate Arabic loanwords. Unlike Arabic, Persian
shows only two values for number, just singular
and plural (no dual), which are usually marked by
either the suffix A?+ +hA and sometimes 	?@+ +An,
or one of the Arabic plural markers. Verbal mor-
phology is very complex in Persian. Each verb
has a past and present root and many verbs have
attached prefix that is regarded part of the root.
A verb in Persian inflects for 14 different tense,
mood, aspect, person, number and voice combina-
tion values (Rasooli et al, 2013). We use Perstem
(Jadidinejad et al, 2010) for segmenting Persian
text.
English, our pivot language, is quite different
from both Arabic and Persian. English is poor
in morphology and barely inflects for number and
tense, and for person in a limited context. English
preprocessing simply includes down-casing, sepa-
rating punctuation and splitting off ??s?.
5.3 Baseline Evaluation
We compare the performance of sentence pivot-
ing against phrase pivoting with different filtering
thresholds. The results are presented in Table 2. In
general, the phrase pivoting outperforms the sen-
tence pivoting even when we use a small filtering
threshold of size 100. Moreover, the higher the
threshold the better the performance but with a di-
minishing gain.

The results in Table 3 show that we get a
nice improvement of ?0.6/0.5 (BLEU/METEOR)
points by adding the connectivity strength fea-
tures. The differences in BLEU scores between
this setup and all other systems are statistically
significant above the 95% level. Statistical signif-
icance is computed using paired bootstrap resam-
pling (Koehn, 2004).
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented an experiment showing the effect of
using two language independent features, source
connectivity score and target connectivity score,
to improve the quality of pivot-based SMT. We
showed that these features help improving the
overall translation quality. In the future, we plan
to explore other features, e.g., the number of the
pivot phases used in connecting the source and tar-
get phrase pair and the similarity between these
pivot phrases. We also plan to explore language
specific features which could be extracted from
some seed parallel data, e.g., syntactic and mor-
phological compatibility of the source and target
phrase pairs.
