abstract 
Word processors or computers used in Japan 
employ Japanese input method through key- 
board stroke combined with Kana (phonetic) 
character to Kanji (ideographic, Chinese) char- 
acter conversion technology. The key factor of 
Kana-to-Kanji conversion technology is how 
to raise the accuracy of the conversion through 
the homophone processing, since we have so 
many homophonic Kanjis. In this paper, we 
report he results of our Kana-to-Kanji conver- 
sion experiments which embody the homo- 
phone processing based on large scale colloca- 
tion data. It is shown that approximately 
135,000 collocations yield 9.1% raise of the 
conversion accuracy compared with the pro- 
totype system which has no collocation data. 
1. Introduction 
Word processors or computers used in Japan ordi- 
narily employ Japanese input method through key- 
board stroke combined ~ with Kana (phonetic) to 
Kanji (ideographic, Chinese) character conversion 
technology. The Kana-to-Kanji conversion is per- 
formed by the morphological nalysis on the input 
Kana siring with no space between words. Word- or 
phrase-segmentation is carried out by the analysis to 
identify the substring of the input which has to be 
converted from Kana to Kanji. Kana-Kanji mixed 
string, which is the ordinary form of Japanese writ- 
ten text, is obtained as the final result. The major 
issue of this technology lies in raising the accuracy 
of the segmentation a d the homophone processing 
to select he correct Kanji among many homophonic 
candidates. 
The conventional methodology for processing ho- 
mophones have used the function that gives the pri- 
ority to the word which was used lastly or to the 
high frequency word. In fact, however, this method 
sometimes tends to cause inadequate conversion due 
to the lack of consideration f the semantic onsis- 
tency of the word concurrence. While it is difficult 
to employ the syntactic or semantic processing in 
earnest for the word processor from the cost vs. 
performance viewpoints, for example, the following 
trials to improve the conversion accuracy have been 
reported: Employing the case-frame to check the 
semantic consistency of combination of words 
\[Oshima, Y. et al, 1986\]. Employing the neural net- 
work to describe the consistency of the concurrence 
of words \[Kobayashi, T. et al,1992\], Making a con- 
currence dictionary for the specific topic or field, 
and giving the priority to the word which is in the 
dictionary when the topic is identified \[Yamamoto, 
K. et al, 1992\]. In any of these studies, however, 
many problems are left unsolved in realizing its 
practical system. 
Besides these semantic or quasi-semantic gadgets, 
we think it much more practical and effective to use 
surface level resources, namely, to use extensively 
the collocation. But how many collocations contrib- 
ute to the accuracy of Kana-to-Kanji conversion is 
not known yet. 
In this paper, we present some results of our ex- 
periments of Kana-to-Kanji conversion, focusing on 
the usage of large scale collocation data. In chapter 
2, descriptions of the collocations used in our sys- 
tem and their classification are given. In chapter 3, 
the technological framework of our Kana-to-Kanji 
conversion systems is outlined. In chapter 4, the 
method and the results of the experiments are given 
along with some discussions. In chapter 5, con- 
eluding remarks are given. 
2. Collocation Data 
Unlike the recent works on the automatic extraction 
of collocations from corpus \[Church, K. W, et al 
1990, Ikehara, S. et al 1996, etc.\], our data have 
been collected manually through the intensive in- 
vestigation of various texts, spending years on it. 
This is because no stochastic framework assures the 
694 
accuracy of the extraction, amely the necessity and 
sufficiency of the data set. The collocations which 
are used in our Kana-to-Kanji conversion system 
consist of two kinds: (1) idiomatic expressions, 
whose meanings eem to be difficult to compose 
from the typical meaning of the individual compo- 
nent words \[Shudo, K. et al, 1988\]. (2) stereotypical 
expressions in which the concurrence of component 
words is seen in the texts with high frequency. The 
collocations are also classified into two classes by a 
grammatical criterion: one is a class of functional 
collocations, which work as functional words such 
as particles (postpositionals) or auxiliary verbs, the 
other is a class of conceptual collocations which 
work as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. The 
latter is further classified into two kinds: uninter- 
ruptible collocations, whose concurrence r lation- 
ship of words are so strong that they can be dealt 
with as single words, and interruptible collocations, 
which are occasionally used separately. 
In the following, the parenthesized number is the 
number of expressions adopted in the system. 
2.1 Functional Collocations (2,174) 
We call expressions which work like a particle rela- 
tional collocation and expressions which work like 
an auxiliary verb at the end of the predicate auxili- 
ary predicative collocation \[Shudo, K. et al, 1980\]. 
relational collocations (760) 
ex. \[ 7./') t, x-C 
ni/tuae (about)

2.2 Uninterruptible Conceptual Col- 
locations (54,290)

3. Kana-to-Kanji Conversion Systems 
We developed four different Kana-to-Kanji conver- 
sion systems, phasing in the collocation data de- 
scribed in 2. The technological framework of the 
system is based on extended bunsetsu (e- 
bunsetsu) model \[Shndo, K. et al, 1980\] for the 
unit of the segmentation f the input Kana string, 
and on minimum cost method \[Yoshimura, K. et 
al., 1987\] combined with Viterbi's algorithm 
\[Viterbi, A,, J., 1967\] for the reduction of the ambi- 
guity of the segmentation. 
A bnn.~etsu is the basic postpositional or predicative 
695 
phrase which composes Japanese sentences, and an 
e-bunsetsu, which is a natural extension of the bun- 
setsu, is defined roughly as follows: 
<e-bunsetsu>::= <prefix>* <conceptual word l
uninterruptible conceptual collocation> 
<suffix>* <functional word l
functional collocation>* 
The e-bunsetsu which includes no collocation is the 
bunsetsu. More refmed rules are used in the actual 
segmentation process. The interruptible conceptual 
collocation is not treated as a single unit but as a 
string ofbunsetsus inthe segmentation process. 
Each collocation in the dictionary which is com- 
posed of multiple number of bunsetsus i marked 
with the boundary between bunsetsus. The system 
first tries to segment the input Kana string into e- 
bunsetsus. Every possible segmentation is evaluated 
by its cost. A segmentation which is assigned the 
least cost is chosen as the solution. 
The boundary between e-bunsetsus in examples in 
this paper is denoted by "/". 
ex. two results of e-bunsetsu-segmentation: 
, hitoh.a/kigqkikunikositagotol, taarimasen 
(there is nothing like being watchful) 
hitohdv'Mga/Idkimi/ko3itcv;kotoha/arimasen 
In the above examples, JKT~/~I\] < kiga/kiku: is 
uninterruptible conceptual collocation and IS-/il~ I., 
Lx/II~|~/~ ) ~'t~ A~ ni/kosita/kotoha/arimasen: is 
a functional collocation. In the first example, these 
collocations are dealt with a single words. The 
second example shows the conventional bunsetsu- 
segmentation. 
The cost for the segmentation candidate is the sum 
of three partial costs: b-cost, c-cost and d-cost 
shown below. 
(1)a segment cost is assigned to each segment. Sum 
of segment costs of all segments i the basic cost 
(b-cost) of a segmentation candidate. By this, the 
collocation tends to have priority over the ordi- 
nary word. The standard and initial value of each 
segment cost is 2, and it is increased by 1 for each 
occurrence of the prefix, su_Wnx, etc. in the seg- 
ment. 
(2)a concatenation cost (c-cost) is assigned to speci- 
fic e-bunsetsu boundaries to revise the b-cost. 
The concatenation, such as adnominal-noun, ad- 
verb-verb, noun-noun, etc. is paid a bonus , 
namely anegative cost, -1. 
(3)a dependency ost (d-cost), which has a negative 
value, is assigned to the strong dependency rela- 
tionship between conceptual words in the candi- 
date, representing the consistency of concurrence 
of conceptual words. By this, the segmentation 
containing the interrupted conceptual collocation 
tends to have priority. The value of a d-cost varies 
from -3 to -1, depending on the strength of the 
concurrence. The interruptible conceptual collo- 
cation is given the biggest bonus i.e.-3. 
The reduction of the homophonic ambiguity, which 
limits Kanji candidates, is carried out in the course 
of the segmentation a d its evaluation by the cost. 
3.1 Prototype System A 
We first developed a prototype Kana-to-Kanji con- 
version system which we call System A, revising 
Kana-to-Kanji conversion software on the market, 
WXG Ver2.05 for PC. 
System A has no collocation data but conventional 
lexical resources, namely functional words (1,010) 
and conceptual words (131,66 I). 
3.2 System B, C and D 
We reinforced System A to obtain System B, C and 
D by phasing in the following collocational re- 
sources. System B is System A equipped addition- 
ally with functional collocations (2,174) and unin- 
terruptible conceptual collocations except for four- 
Kanji-compound and proverb type collocations 
(49,461). System C is System B equipped addition- 
ally with four-Kanji-compound (2,231) and proverb 
type collocations (2,598). Further, System D is 
System C equipped additionally with interruptible 
conceptual collocations (78,251). 
4. Experiments 
4.1 Text Data for Evaluation 
Prior to the experiments of Kana-to-Kanji conver- 
sion, we prepared a large volume of text data by 
hand which is formally a set of triples whose first 
component a is a Kana string (a sentence) with no 
space, The second component b is the correct seg- 
mentation result of a, indicating each boundary 
between bunsetsus with "/" or ".". '7" and .... 
means obligatory and optional boundary, respec- 
tively. The third component c is the correct conver- 
sion result of a, which is a Kana-Kanji mixed string. 
ex. { a: {S-;\[9\[s-\[~7b~l,~-Ct,~To 
niwanibaragasaiteiru 
696 
(roses are in bloom in a garden) 
b: IZab)\[7-/\[~?~/~ \[, .(,~70 
niwani/baraga/saite, iru
c: I~I~.I#~#J~II~I,~T..I,x,'~ } 
The introduction of the optional boundary assures 
the flexible evaluation. For example, each ofl~lA 
"C/t ,~ saite/iru (be in bloom) and I~I,~'CIA~ 
saiteiru is accepted as a correct result. The data fde 
is divided into two sub-files, fl and 12, depending 
on the number of bunsetsus in the Kana string a. fl 
has 10,733 triples, whose a has less than five 
bunsetsus and t2 has 12,192 triples, whose a has 
more than four bunsetsus. 
4.2 Method of Evaluation 
Each a in the text data is fed to the conversion sys- 
tem. The system outputs two forms of the least cost 
result: b', Kana string segmented to bunsetsus by 
"/", and c', Kana-Kanji mixed string corresponding 
to b and c of the correct data, respectively. Each of 
the following three cases is counted for the evalua- 
tion. 
SS (Segmentation Success): bTM b 
CS (Complete Success): bTM b and ?'= ? 
TS (Tolerative Success): b'= b and ?'~ ? 
There are many kinds of notational f uctuation in 
Japanese. For example, the conjugational suffix of 
some kind of Japanese verb is not always necessi- 
tated, therefore,~l,,I I'{'f,~fi I'I'Y and ~.1: are all 
acceptable r sults for input ~ L)~ I~ uriage (sales). 
Besides, a single word has sometimes more than 
one Kanji notations, e.g. "~g hama (beach) and ;~ 
hama (beach) are both acceptable, and so on. c'- ? 
in the case of TS means that e' coincides with ? 
completely or excepting the part which is hetero- 
morphic in the above sense. For this, each of our 
conversion system has a dictionary which contains 
approximately 35,000 fluctuated notations of con- 
ceptual words. 
4.3 Results of Experiments 
Results of the experiments are given in Table 1 and 
Table 2 for input file fl and 12, respectively. 
Comparing the statistics of system A with D, we can 
conclude that the introduction of approximately 
135,000 collocation data causes 8.1% and 10.5 % 
raise of CS and TS rate, respectively, in case of re- 
latively short input strings (fl). The raise of SS rate 
for t"1 is 2.7%. In case of the longer input strings (t2) 
whose average number of bunsetsus is approxi- 
mately 12.6, the raise ofCS, TS and SS rate is 2.4 %, 
5.2 % and 5.7 %, respectively. As a consequence, 
the raise ofCS, TS and SS rate is 6.2 %, 9.1% and 
3.8 % on the average, respectively.

4.4 Comparison with a Software on the 
Market 
We compared System D with a Kana-to-Kanji conver- 
sion soRware for PC on the market, WXG Ver2.05 under 
the same condition except for the anaount of installed 
collocation dam For this, system D was reinforced and 
renmned D', by equipping with WXG's 10,000 items of 
word dependency description. Both systems were dis- 
abled for the learning functiom WXG has approximately 
60,000 collocations (3,000 unintcrmptible and 57,000 
interruptible collocations), whereas Syst~nn D' has ap- 
proximately 135,000 collocations. The statistical results 
are givm in Table 3 and Table 4 for the corpus fl and t2, 
respectively. 
The tables how that the raise of CS, TS and SS rme, 
which was oblained by System D' is 2.5 %, 4.5 % and 
3.9 % on the average, respectively. No fialher compari- 
son with the conanercial products has been done, since 
we judge the perfommnce ofWXG Ver.2.05 to be aver- 
age among them. 
4.5 Discussions 
Table 1 '~ 4 show that the longer input the system is 
given, the more difficult for the system to make the cor- 
rect solution and the difference between accuracy rate of 
WXG and system D' is less for f2 than for fl. Further 
investigation clarified that the error of System D is 
mainly caused by missing words or expressions in the 
machine dictionmy. Specifically, it was clmified that he 
dictionary does not have the sufficient number of Kata- 
Kzna words and people's names. In Mdition, the number 
of fluctualional variants installed in the dictionary men- 
fioned in 4.2 turned out to be inst~cient. These problems 
should be rmaedied infuture. 
5. Concluding Remarks 
In this p,%~r, the effectiveness of the large scale colloca- 
tion data for the improvement of the conversion accuracy 
of Kana-to-Kanji conversion process used in Japmese 
word processors was chrified, by relatively large scale 
experiments. 
The extensive collection of the collocations has been 
c,m'fied out manually these ten years by the authors in 
order to realize not only high precision word processor 
but also more general Japanese language ~ in 
future. A lot of resources, chool texttx3oks, newspapers, 
novels, journals, dictionaries, etc. have been investigated 
by workers for the collection. The candidates for the col- 
location have been judged one after another by them. 
Among collocations described inthis paper, the idiomatic 
expressions are quite burdensome in the developmera of 
NLP, since thW do not follow the principle of composi- 
lionality of the memaing Generally speaking the more 
extensive collocational d__~___ it deals with, the less the 
"rule syst~n" of the rule based NLP system is burdened. 
This means the great importance of the enrichment of 
collocalional data Whereas it is inevitable that the ~oi- 
awiness lies in the human judgment and selection of 
collocations, we believe that our collocation r l~ is far 
more refined than the automalicany extracted one from 
corpora which has been recently reported \[Church, K. W. 
etal, 1990, Ikeham, S. etal, 1996, etc.\]. 
We believe that he approach descrlqxxi here is important 
for the evolution of NLP product in general s well.
