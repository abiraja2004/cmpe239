Abstract
Simply detecting negation cues is not suffi-
cient to determine the semantics of negation,
scope and focus must be taken into account.
While scope detection has recently seen re-
peated attention, the linguistic notion of focus
is only now being introduced into computa-
tional work. The *Sem2012 Shared Task is
pioneering this effort by introducing a suitable
dataset and annotation guidelines. CLaC?s
NegFocus system is a solid baseline approach
to the task.
1 Introduction
Negation has attracted the attention of the NLP com-
munity and we have seen an increased advance in
sophistication of processing tools. In order to assess
factual information as asserted or not, it is important
to distinguish the difference between
(1) (a) Newt Gingrich Not Conceding Race
After Losing Florida Primary
(b) Newt Gingrich Conceding Race Af-
ter Losing Florida Primary
This distinction is important and cannot be properly
inferred from the surrounding context, not conced-
ing a race after losing is in fact contrary to expecta-
tion in the original headline (1a), and the constructed
(1b) is more likely in isolation.
Negation has been addressed as a task in itself,
rather than as a component of other tasks in recent
shared tasks and workshops. Detection of negation
cues and negation scope at CoNLL (Farkas et al,
2010), BioNLP (Kim et al, 2011) and the Negation
and Speculation in NLP Workshop (Morante and
Sporleder, 2010) laid the foundation for the *Sem
2012 Shared Task. While the scope detection has
been extended to fictional text in this task, an impor-
tant progression from the newspaper and biomedi-
cal genres, the newly defined Focus Detection for
Negation introduces the important question: what is
the intended opposition in (1a)? The negation trig-
ger is not, the scope of the negation is the entire
verb phrase, but which aspect of the verb phrase is
underscored as being at variance with reality, that
is, which of the following possible (for the sake of
linguistic argument only) continuations is the more
likely one:
(2) i . . . , Santorum does.
(?Newt Gingrich)
ii . . . , Doubling Efforts (?concede)
iii . . . , Demanding Recount (?race)
iv . . . , Texas redistricting at fault
(?Florida)
This notion of focus of negation is thus a prag-
matic one, chosen by the author and encoded with
various means. Usually, context is necessary to de-
termine focus. Often, different possible interpreta-
tions of focus do not change the factual meaning of
the overall text, but rather its coherence. In (1 a) the
imagined possible contexts (2 ii) and (2 iii) closely
correspond to a simple negation of (1 b), (2 i) and
(2 iv) do not feel properly represented by simply
negating (1 b). This level of interpretation is con-
tentious among people and it is the hallmark of well-
written, well-edited text to avoid unnecessary guess-
work while at the same time avoiding unnecessary
294
clarifying repetition. The potential for ambiguity is
demonstrated by Example (3) from (Partee, 1993),
where it is questionable whether the speaker in fact
has possession of the book in question.
(3) I didn?t get that book from Mary
Here, if the focus is from Mary, it would be likely
that the speaker has possion of the book, but received
it some other way. If the focus is that book, the
speaker does not have possession of it.
It is important to note hat this notion of focus is
not syntactically determined as shown in (3) (even
though we use syntactic heuristics here to approxi-
mate it) but pragmatically and it correlates with pro-
nunciation stress, as discussed in linguistics by (Han
and Romero, 2001). More recently, focus negation
has been identified as a special use (Poletto, 2008).
The difference of scope and focus of negation are
elaborated by (Partee, 1993), and have been used for
computational use by (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011).
The *Sem 2012 Task 2 on Focus Detection builds
on recent negation scope detection capabilities and
introduces a gold standard to identify the focus item.
Focus of negation is annotated over 3,993 sentences
in the WSJ section of the Penn TreeBank marked
with MNEG in PropBank. It accounts for verbal,
analytical and clausal relation to a negation trigger;
the role most likely to correspond to the focus was
selected as focus. All sentences of the training data
contain a negation. A sample annotation from the
gold standard is given in (4), where PropBank se-
mantic roles are labelled A1, M-NEG, and M-TMP
and focus is underlined (until June).
(4) ?AdecisionA1? is?n
?tM?NEG? expected
? until June M?TMP ?
2 Previous Work
A recent study in combining regular pattern ex-
traction with parse information for enhanced in-
dexing of radiology reports showed effective de-
tection of negated noun phrases for that corpus
(Huang and Lowe, 2007). NegFinder (Mutalik et
al., 2001) detects negated concepts in dictated med-
ical documents with a simple set of corpus spe-
cific context-free rules, and they observe that in
their corpus ?One of the words no, denies/denied,
not, or without was present in 92.5 percent of
all negations.? Interestingly, several of their rules
concern coordination (and, or) or prepositional
phrase attachment patterns (of, for). NegEx (Chap-
man et al, 2001) is publicly available and main-
tained and updated with community-enhanced trig-
ger lists (http://code.google.com/p/negex/
wiki/NegExTerms). NegEx ?locates trigger terms
indicating a clinical condition is negated or possi-
ble and determines which text falls within the scope
of the trigger terms.? NegEx uses a simple regular
expression algorithm with a small number of nega-
tion phrases and focuses on a wide variety of trig-
gers but limits them to domain relevant ones. Con-
sequently, the trigger terms and conditions are heav-
ily stacked with biomedical domain specific terms.
Outside the biomedical text community, sentiment
and opinion analysis research features negation de-
tection (Wilson, 2008). Current gold standard anno-
tations for explicit negation as well as related phe-
nomena include TIMEBANK (Pustejovsky et al,
2003), MPQA (Wiebe et al, 2005), and Bio-Scope
(Vincze et al, 2008).
(Wiegand et al, 2010) presents a flat feature com-
bination approach of features of different granularity
and analytic sophistication, since in opinion mining
the boundary between negation and negative expres-
sions is fluid.
3 CLaC?s NegFocus
CLaC Labs? general, lightweight negation mod-
ule is intended to be embedded in any process-
ing pipeline. The heuristics-based system is com-
posed of three modules for the GATE (Cunningham
et al, 2011) environment: the first component de-
tects and annotates explicit negation cues present in
the corpus, the second component detects and an-
notates the syntactic scope of the detected instances
of verbal negation, and the third component im-
plements focus heuristics for negation. The first
two steps were developed independently, drawing on
data from MPQA (Wiebe et al, 2005) and TIME-
BANK (Pustejovsky et al, 2003) with validation on
Bio-Scope (Vincze et al, 2008). The third step has
been added based on data for the *Sem 2012 chal-
lenge and is intended to validate both, the first two
?preprocessing? steps and the simple heuristic ap-
proximation of focus.
295
3.1 Data Preprocessing
Parser-based, our focus detection pipeline requires
as input entire sentences. Therefore, the first step
requires the extraction of each sentence utilizing the
supplied token numbers and save them in the correct
format. The system then performs standard prepro-
cessing: sentence splitting, tokenization, parsing us-
ing the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003;
de Marneffe and Manning, 2006) and morphologi-
cal preprocessing. Note that NegFocus does not use
any PropBank annotations nor other provided train-
ing annotations, resulting in an independent, parser-
based stand-alone module.
3.2 Detection of Negation Triggers
The Focus Detection task only considers the explicit
negation cues not, nor, never. The first step in Neg-
Focus is thus to identify these triggers in the sen-
tences using an explicit negation trigger word list.
3.3 Syntactic Scope Detection
The Focus Detection task only considers negation of
verbs. Thus, NegFocus extracts the syntactic com-
plement of the verb to form the negated verb phrase
from the dependency graphs (de Marneffe and Man-
ning, 2006). We annotate this as the syntactic scope
of the negation. Note that while we use dependency
graphs, our syntactic scope is based on the parse tree
and differs from the notion of scope encoded in Bio-
Scope (Vincze et al, 2008) and the related format
used for the *Sem 2012 Negation Scope Annotation
task, which represent in our opinion the pragmatic
notion of scope for the logical negation operation.
Syntactic scope detection is thus considered to be
a basic stepping stone towards the pragmatic scope
and since the Focus Detection task does not provide
scope annotations, we use syntactic scope here to
validate this principle.
Our heuristics are inspired by (Kilicoglu and
Bergler, 2011). In the majority of cases the depen-
dency relation which identifies the syntactic scope
is the neg relation. Traditionally, parse trees iden-
tify scope as lower or to the right of the trigger term,
and our scope module assumes these grammatical
constraints, yet includes the verb itself for the pur-
poses of the shared task. Example 5, from the train-
ing dataset ?The Hound of the Baskervilles? by Co-
nan Doyle for the *Sem 2012 Negation Scope Anno-
tation task, demonstrates our syntactic scope of the
negation (underlined), in contrast with the gold stan-
dard scope annotation (in brackets). The gold anno-
tation guidelines follow the proposal of Morante et
al. (Morante et al, 2011)1.
(5) [We did] not [drive up to the door] but
got down near the gate of the avenue.
3.4 Focus Heuristics
The third and final step for NegFocus is to annotate
focus in sentences containing verbal negations. Us-
ing the verbal negation scope annotations of the pre-
vious step, four focus heuristics are invoked:
3.4.1 Baseline
The Baseline heuristic for this component is de-
fined according to notions discussed in (Huddle-
ston and Pullum, 2002), where the last constituent
in the verb phrase of a clause is commonly the de-
fault location to place the heaviest stress, which we
here equate with the focus. Example (6) depicts an
instance where both NegFocus results (underlined)
and the gold focus annotation (in brackets) match
exactly. The baseline heuristic achieves 47.4% re-
call and 49.4% precision on the training set and 47%
recall and 49.7% precision on the test set.
(6) NBC broadcast throughout the entire
night and did not go off the air
[until noon yesterday] .
As pointed out in Section 3.3, focus is not always
determined by scope (Partee, 1993). The training
data gave rise to three additional heuristics.
3.4.2 Adverb
When an adverb is directly preceding and con-
nected through an advmod dependency relation to
the negated verb, the adverb constituent is deter-
mined as the focus of the negation.
(7) Although it may not be [legally] obli-
gated to sell the company if the buy-
out group can?t revive its bid, it may
have to explore alternatives if the buyers
come back with a bid much lower than
the group ?s original $ 300-a-share pro-
posal.

3.4.3 Noun Subject Passive
Passives are frequent in newspaper articles and
passive constructions front what would otherwise
be the verb complement. Thus the fronted mate-
rial should be eligible for focus assignment. Pas-
sives are flagged through the nsubjpass dependency,
and for cases where the negated verb participates in
an nsubjpass relation and has no other complement,
the nsubjpass is determined as the focus.
(8) [Billings] were n?t disclosed.
3.4.4 Negation Cue
The challenge data has cases where the negation
cue itself is its own focus. These cases seem to be
pragmatically determined. Error cases were reduced
when determining the negation cue to be its own fo-
cus in two cases. The first case occurs when the
negated verb has an empty complement (and is not a
passive construction), as in Example 9.
(9) Both said the new plan would [n?t] work.
The second case occurs when the negated verb
embeds a verb that we identify as an implicit nega-
tion. We have a list of implicit negation triggers
largely compiled from MPQA (Wiebe et al, 2005).
Implicit negations are verbs that lexically encode a
predicate and a negation, such as reject or fail.
(10) Black activist Walter Sisulu said the
African National Congress would [n?t]
reject violence as a way to pressure
the South African government into con-
cessions that might lead to negotiations
over apartheid . . .
4 Results
Ordering the heuristics impacts on recall. We place
the most specific heuristics before the more general
ones to avoid starvation effects. For example, the
adverb heuristic followed by the noun subject pas-
sive heuristic achieved better results at the begin-
ning, since they are more specific then the negation
cue heuristic.
Table 1 shows the performance of the heuristics
of NegFocus on the test set and on the development
set. We observe that the heuristics are stable across
the two sets with a 60% accuracy on the test set. The
worst performer is the baseline, which is very coarse
for such a semantically sophisticated task: assuming
that the last element of the negated verb phrase is the
focus is truly a baseline.

Figure 2: System Results
Our heuristics, albeit simplistic, are based on lin-
guistically sound observations. The heuristic nature
allows additional heuristics that are more tailored to
a corpus or a task to be added without incurring un-
manageable complexity, in fact each heuristic can
be tested on the development set and can report on
the test set to monitor its performance. The heuris-
tics will also provide excellent features for statistical
systems.
5 Error Analysis
We distinguish 11 classes of errors on the test set.
The classes of errors depicted in Table (3) indi-
cates that the classes of errors and their frequencies
are consistent across the different data sets. The
third error class in Table (3) is of particular inter-

est to us, as it highlights the different interpretations
of verbal negation scope. NegFocus will not include
the noun subject in the syntactic negation scope, and
therefore the noun subject constituent is never a fo-
cus candidate as required in Example (11).
(11) In New York, [a spokesman for American
Brands] would n?t comment.
Similarly, the seventh error class in Table (3) con-
tains focus annotations that are not contained in
NegFocus negation scopes. Example (12) shows an
error where the sentence begins with a prepositional
phrase that is annotated as the gold focus.
(12) [On some days], the Nucor plant does n?t
produce anything.
We disagree with the gold annotations on this and
similar cases: the prepositional phrase on some days
is not negated, it provides a temporal specification
for the negated statement the Nucor plant produces
something and in our opinion, the negation negates
something, contrasting it with
(13) [On some days], the Nucor plant does n?t
produce a lot.
which allows for some production, which indi-
cates to us that without context information, low fo-
cus is warranted here.
NegFocus incorporates a focus heuristic for deter-
mining the passive noun subject constituent as the
focus of the negation, however only in cases where
the negated verb has an empty complement. The
fourth error class contains errors in focus determina-
tion where this heuristic fails and where the passive
subject is the gold focus despite the complement of
the negated verb not being empty, requiring further
analysis:
(14) To simplify the calculations , [com-
missions on the option and underlying
stock] are n?t included in the table.
NegFocus determines an adverb directly preced-
ing the verb trigger as the focus of the negation, but,
as described in the fifth error class, the gold focus
annotations in a few cases determine adverbs to be
the focus of the negation even when they don?t di-
rectly precede the verb, but are linked by the adv-
mod relation, as in Example (15). When we exper-
imented with relaxing the adjacency constraint, re-

(15) ? The intervention has been friendly,
meaning that they [really] did n?t
have to do it, ? said Maria Fiorini
Ramirez, money-market economist at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
The majority of NegFocus errors occur in the sec-
ond error class. Table (4) further analyzes the second
error class, where the gold annotation puts the nega-
tion trigger in the focus but NegFocus finds another
focus (usually in the verb complement).
The gold standard annotations place the focus of
the negation of verb v on the negation trigger if it
cannot be inferred that an action v occurred (Blanco
and Moldovan, 2011). NegFocus will only make this
assumption when the verb complement constituent
is empty, otherwise the baseline focus heuristic will
be triggered, as depicted in Example (16).
(16) AMR declined to comment , and
Mr. Trump did [n?t] respond
to requests for interviews.
Furthermore, the CLaC system will choose to trigger
the subject passive focus heuristic in the case where
the verb complement constituent is empty, and the
passive noun subject is present. In contrast, the gold
standard annotations do not necessarily follow this
heuristic as seen in Example (17).
(17) That is n?t 51 %, and the claim is [n?t]
documented .
Lastly, the gold focus annotations include focus
spans which are discontinuous. NegFocus will only
detect one continuous focus span within one in-
stance of a verbal negation. The eleventh error class
includes those cases where NegFocus matches one
of the gold focus spans but not the other as seen in
Example (18).

[to have an impact on coming operating
results], Linear added .
These error cases show that more analysis of the
data, but also of the very notion of focus, is neces-
sary.
6 Conclusion
We conclude that this experiment confirmed the hy-
pothesis that negation trigger detection, syntactic
scope determination, and focus determination are
usefully modelled as a pipeline of three simple mod-
ules that apply after standard text preprocessing and
dependency parsing. Approximating focus from a
principled, linguistic point of view proved to be a
quick and robust exercise. Performance on develop-
ment and test sets is nearly identical and in a range
around 58% f-measure. While the annotation stan-
dards as well as our heuristics warrant revisiting, we
believe that the value of the focus annotation will
prove its value beyond negation. The challenge data
provide a valuable resource in themselves, but we
believe that their true value will be shown by using
the derived notion of focus in downstream applica-
tions. For initial experiments, the simple NegFocus
pipeline is a stable prototype.
