Abstract
We propose a language-independent word
normalization method exemplified on
modernizing historical Slovene words.
Our method relies on character-based sta-
tistical machine translation and uses only
shallow knowledge. We present the rel-
evant lexicons and two experiments. In
one, we use a lexicon of historical word?
contemporary word pairs and a list of con-
temporary words; in the other, we only
use a list of historical words and one of
contemporary ones. We show that both
methods produce significantly better re-
sults than the baseline.
1 Introduction
A lot of recent work deals with detecting and
matching cognate words in corpora of closely re-
lated language varieties. This approach is also use-
ful for processing historical language (Piotrowski,
2012), where historical word forms are matched
against contemporary forms, thus normalizing the
varied and changing spelling of words over time.
Such normalization has a number of applications:
it enables better full-text search in cultural heritage
digital libraries, makes old texts more understand-
able to today?s readers and significantly improves
further text processing by allowing PoS tagging,
lemmatization and parsing models trained on con-
temporary language to be used on historical texts.
In this paper, we try to match word pairs of dif-
ferent historical stages of the Slovene language. In
one experiment we use character-based machine
translation to learn the character correspondences
from pairs of words. In the second experiment, we
start by extracting noisy word pairs from monolin-
gual1 lexicons; this experiment simulates a situa-

to refer to two diachronic states of the language.
tion where bilingual data is not available.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 presents related work, Section 3 details
the dataset used, Section 4 shows the experiments
and results, and Section 5 concludes.
2 Related Work
The most common approach to modernizing his-
torical words uses (semi-) hand-constructed tran-
scription rules, which are then applied to historical
words, and the results filtered against a contempo-
rary lexicon (Baron and Rayson, 2008; Scheible et
al., 2010; Scheible et al, 2011); such rules are of-
ten encoded and used as (extended) finite state au-
tomata (Reffle, 2011). An alternative to such de-
ductive approaches is the automatic induction of
mappings. For example, Kestemont et al (2010)
use machine learning to convert 12th century Mid-
dle Dutch word forms to contemporary lemmas.
Word modernization can be viewed as a special
case of transforming cognate words from one lan-
guage to a closely related one. This task has tradi-
tionally been performed with stochastic transduc-
ers or HMMs trained on a set of cognate word
pairs (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001). More re-
cently, character-based statistical machine trans-
lation (C-SMT) (Vilar et al, 2007; Tiedemann,
2009) has been proposed as an alternative ap-
proach to translating words between closely re-
lated languages and has been shown to outperform
stochastic transducers on the task of name translit-
eration (Tiedemann and Nabende, 2009).
For the related task of matching cognate pairs in
bilingual non-parallel corpora, various language-
independent similarity measures have been pro-
posed on the basis of string edit distance (Kon-
drak and Dorr, 2004). Cognate word matching has
been shown to facilitate the extraction of trans-
lation lexicons from comparable corpora (Koehn
and Knight, 2002; Kondrak et al, 2003; Fi?er and
Ljube?ic?, 2011).

For using SMT for modernizing historical
words, the only work so far is, to the best of our
knowledge, S?nchez-Mart?nez et al (2013).
3 The Dataset
In this section we detail the dataset that was used
in the subsequent experiments, which consists
of a frequency lexicon of contemporary Slovene
and training and testing lexicons of historical
Slovene.2
3.1 The Lexicon of Contemporary Slovene
Sloleks is a large inflectional lexicon of contem-
porary Slovene.3 The lexicon contains lemmas
with their full inflectional paradigms and with
the word forms annotated with frequency of oc-
currence in a large reference corpus of Slovene.
For the purposes of this experiment, we extracted
from Sloleks the list of its lower-cased word forms
(930,000) together with their frequency.
3.2 Corpora of Historical Slovene
The lexicons used in the experiments are con-
structed from two corpora of historical Slovene.4
The texts in the corpora are, inter alia marked up
with the year of publication and their IANA lan-
guage subtag (sl for contemporary Slovene al-
phabet and sl-bohoric for the old, pre-1850
Bohoric? alphabet). The word tokens are anno-
tated with the attributes nform, mform, lemma, tag,
gloss, where only the first two are used in the pre-
sented experiments.
The nform attribute contains the result of a sim-
ple normalization step, consisting of lower-casing,
removal of vowel diacritics (which are not used in
contemporary Slovene), and conversion of the Bo-
horic? alphabet to the contemporary one. Thus, we
do not rely on the C-SMT model presented below
to perform these pervasive, yet deterministic and
fairly trivial transformations.
The modernized form of the word, mform is the
word as it is (or would be, for extinct words) writ-
ten today: the task of the experiments is to predict
the correct mform given an nform.

The two corpora were constructed by sampling
individual pages from a collection of books and
editions of one newspaper, where the pages (but
not necessarily the publications) of the two cor-
pora are disjoint:5
? goo300k is the smaller, but fully manually
annotated corpus, in which the annotations of
each word have been verified;6
? foo3M is the larger, and only partially manu-
ally annotated corpus, in which only the more
frequent word forms that do not already ap-
pear in goo300k have verified annotations.
The texts have been marked up with the time
period in which they were published, e.g., 18B
meaning the second half of the 18th century. This
allows us to observe the changes to the vocabulary
in 50-year time slices. The sizes of the corpora are
given in Table 1 and Table 2.
3.3 Lexicons of Historical Slovene
From the two corpora we have extracted the
training and testing lexicons, keeping only words
(e.g., discarding digits) that have been manually
verified. The training lexicon, Lgoo is derived
from the goo300k corpus, while the test lexicon,
Lfoo is derived from the foo3M corpus and, as
5The corpora used in our experiments are slightly smaller
than the originals: the text from two books and one newspa-
per issue has been removed, as the former contain highly id-
iosyncratic ways of spelling words, not seen elsewhere, and
the latter contains a mixture of the Bohoric? and contempo-
rary alphabet, causing problems for word form normaliza-
tion. The texts older than 1750 have also been removed from
goo300k, as such texts do not occur in foo3M, which is used
for testing our approach.
6A previous version of this corpus is described in (Er-
javec, 2012).

mentioned, contains no ?nform, mform? pairs al-
ready appearing in Lgoo. This setting simulates
the task of an existing system receiving a new text
to modernize.
The lexicons used in the experiment contain en-
tries with nform, mform, and the per-slice frequen-
cies of the pair in the corpus from which the lexi-
con was derived, as illustrated in the example be-
low:
benetkah benetkah 19A:1 19B:1
aposteljnov apostolov 19A:1 19B:1
ar?ati ar?etu* 18B:2
The first example is a word that has not changed
its spelling (and was observed twice in the 19th
century texts), while the second and third have
changed their spelling. The asterisk on the third
example indicates that the mform is not present in
Sloleks. We exclude such pairs from the test lexi-
con (but not from the training lexicon) since they
will most likely not be correctly modernized by
our model, which relies on Sloleks. The sizes of
the two lexicons are given in Table 3 and Table 4.
For Lgoo we give the number of pairs including the
OOV words, while for Lfoo we exclude them; the
tables also show the numbers of pairs with iden-
tical and different words. Note that the summary
row has smaller numbers than the sum of the in-
dividual rows, as different slices can contain the
same pairs.
4 Experiments and Results
We conducted two experiments with the data de-
scribed above. In both cases, the goal is to cre-
ate C-SMT models for automatically modernizing
historical Slovene words. In each experiment, we
create three different models for the three time pe-
riods of old Slovene (18B, 19A, 19B).
The first experiment follows a supervised setup:
we train a C-SMT model on ?historical word,
contemporary word? pairs from Lgoo and test the
model on the word pairs of Lfoo. The second ex-
periment is unsupervised and relies on monolin-
gual data only: we match the old Slovene words
from Lgoo with modern Slovene word candidates
from Sloleks; this noisy list of word pairs then
serves to train the C-SMT model. We test again
on Lfoo.
4.1 Supervised Learning
SMT models consist of two main components: the
translation model, which is trained on bilingual
data, and the language model, which is trained
on monolingual data of the target language. We
use the word pairs from Lgoo to train the transla-
tion model, and the modern Slovene words from
Lgoo to train the language model.7 As said above,
we test the model on the word pairs of Lfoo.
The experiments have been carried out with the
tools of the standard SMT pipeline: GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) for alignment, Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007) for phrase extraction and decoding, and
IRSTLM (Federico et al, 2008) for language mod-
elling. After preliminary experimentation, we set-
tled on the following parameter settings:
? We have obtained the best results with a 5-
gram language model. The beginning and
the end of each word were marked by special
symbols.
? The alignments produced by GIZA++ are
combined with the grow-diag-final method.
? We chose to disable distortion, which ac-
counts for the possibility of swapping ele-
ments; there is not much evidence of this phe-
nomenon in the evolution of Slovene.
? We use Good Turing discounting to adjust the
weights of rare alignments.
? We set 20% of Lgoo aside for Minimum Error
Rate Training.
The candidates proposed by the C-SMT sys-
tem are not necessarily existing modern Slovene
words. Following Vilar et al (2007), we added a
7It is customary to use a larger dataset for the language
model than for the translation model. However, adding the
Sloleks data to the language model did not improve perfor-
mances.

lexicon filter, which selects the first candidate pro-
posed by the C-SMT that also occurs in Sloleks.8
The results of these experiments, with and with-
out lexicon filter, are shown in Table 5. As a base-
line, we consider the words that are identical in
both language varieties. Without lexicon filter, we
obtain significant improvements over the baseline
for the first two time spans, but as the language va-
rieties become closer and the proportion of identi-
cal words increases, the SMT model becomes less
efficient. In contrast to Vilar et al (2007), we have
found the lexicon filter to be very useful: it im-
proves the results by nearly 10% absolute in 18B
and 19A, and by 5% in 19B.
4.2 Unsupervised Learning
The supervised approach requires a bilingual
training lexicon which associates old words with
modern words. Such lexicons may not be available
for a given language variety. In the second exper-
iment we investigate what can be achieved with
purely monolingual data. Concretely, we propose
a bootstrapping step to collect potential cognate
pairs from two monolingual word lists (the histor-
ical words of Lgoo, and Sloleks). We then train the
C-SMT system on these hypothesized pairs.
The bootstrapping step consists of searching,
for each historical word of Lgoo, its most similar
modern words in Sloleks.9 The similarity between
two words is computed with the BI-SIM measure
(Kondrak and Dorr, 2004). BI-SIM is a measure
of graphemic similarity which uses character bi-
grams as basic units. It does not allow crossing
alignments, and it is normalized by the length of
the longer string. As a result, this measure cap-
tures a certain degree of context sensitivity, avoids
8In practice, we generated 50-best candidate lists with
Moses, and applied the lexicon filter on that lists. In case
none of the 50 candidates occurs in Sloleks, the filter returns
the candidate with the best Moses score.
9In order to speed up the process and remove some noise,
we excluded hapaxes from Lgoo and all but the 20,000 most
frequent words from Sloleks. We also excluded words that
contain less than four characters from both corpora, since the
similarity measures proved unreliable on them.
counterintuitive alignments and favours associa-
tions between words of similar lengths. BI-SIM
is a language-independent measure and therefore
well-suited for this bootstrapping step.
For each old Slovene word, we keep the corre-
spondences that maximize the BI-SIM value, but
only if this value is greater than 0.8.10 For the
18B slice, this means that 812 out of 1333 histori-
cal words (60.9%) have been matched with at least
one modern word; 565 of the matches (69.6%, or
42.4% of the total) were correct.
These word correspondences are then used to
train a C-SMT model, analogously to the super-
vised approach. As for the language model, it is
trained on Sloleks, since the modernized forms
of Lgoo are not supposed to be known. Due to
the smaller training set size, MERT yielded un-
satisfactory results; we used the default weights of
Moses instead. The other settings are the same as
reported in Section 4.1. Again, we conducted ex-
periments for the three time slices. We tested the
system on the word pairs of the Lfoo lexicon, as
above. Results are shown in Table 5.
While the unsupervised approach performs sig-
nificantly less well on the 18B period, the differ-
ences gradually diminish for the subsequent time
slices; the model always performs better than the
baseline. Again, the lexicon filter proves useful in
all cases.
5 Conclusion
We have successfully applied the C-SMT ap-
proach to modernize historical words, obtaining
up to 57.0% (absolute) accuracy improvements
with the supervised approach and up to 33.5% (ab-
solute) with the unsupervised approach. In the fu-
ture, we plan to extend our model to modernize
entire texts in order to take into account possible
tokenization changes.
10This threshold has been chosen empirically on the basis
of earlier experiments, and allows us to eliminate correspon-
dences that are likely to be wrong. If several modern words
correspond to the same old word, we keep all of them.
