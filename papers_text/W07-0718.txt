Abstract
This paper evaluates the translation quality
of machine translation systems for 8 lan-
guage pairs: translating French, German,
Spanish, and Czech to English and back.
We carried out an extensive human evalua-
tion which allowed us not only to rank the
different MT systems, but also to perform
higher-level analysis of the evaluation pro-
cess. We measured timing and intra- and
inter-annotator agreement for three types of
subjective evaluation. We measured the cor-
relation of automatic evaluation metrics with
human judgments. This meta-evaluation re-
veals surprising facts about the most com-
monly used methodologies.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the results for the shared trans-
lation task of the 2007 ACL Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. The goals of this paper are
twofold: First, we evaluate the shared task entries
in order to determine which systems produce trans-
lations with the highest quality. Second, we analyze
the evaluation measures themselves in order to try to
determine ?best practices? when evaluating machine
translation research.
Previous ACL Workshops on Machine Transla-
tion were more limited in scope (Koehn and Monz,
2005; Koehn and Monz, 2006). The 2005 workshop
evaluated translation quality only in terms of Bleu
score. The 2006 workshop additionally included a
limited manual evaluation in the style of NIST ma-
chine translation evaluation workshop. Here we ap-
ply eleven different automatic evaluation metrics,
and conduct three different types of manual evalu-
ation.
Beyond examining the quality of translations pro-
duced by various systems, we were interested in ex-
amining the following questions about evaluation
methodologies: How consistent are people when
they judge translation quality? To what extent do
they agree with other annotators? Can we im-
prove human evaluation? Which automatic evalu-
ation metrics correlate most strongly with human
judgments of translation quality?
This paper is organized as follows:
? Section 2 gives an overview of the shared task.
It describes the training and test data, reviews
the baseline system, and lists the groups that
participated in the task.
? Section 3 describes the manual evaluation. We
performed three types of evaluation: scoring
with five point scales, relative ranking of trans-
lations of sentences, and ranking of translations
of phrases.
? Section 4 lists the eleven different automatic
evaluation metrics which were also used to
score the shared task submissions.
? Section 5 presents the results of the shared task,
giving scores for each of the systems in each of
the different conditions.
? Section 6 provides an evaluation of the dif-
ferent types of evaluation, giving intra- and
136
inter-annotator agreement figures for the man-
ual evaluation, and correlation numbers for the
automatic metrics.
2 Shared task overview
This year?s shared task changed in some aspects
from last year?s:
? We gave preference to the manual evaluation of
system output in the ranking of systems. Man-
ual evaluation was done by the volunteers from
participating groups and others. Additionally,
there were three modalities of manual evalua-
tion.
? Automatic metrics were also used to rank the
systems. In total eleven metrics were applied,
and their correlation with the manual scores
was measured.
? As in 2006, translation was from English, and
into English. English was again paired with
German, French, and Spanish. We additionally
included Czech (which was fitting given the lo-
cation of the WS).
Similar to the IWSLT International Workshop on
Spoken Language Translation (Eck and Hori, 2005;
Paul, 2006), and the NIST Machine Translation
Evaluation Workshop (Lee, 2006) we provide the
shared task participants with a common set of train-
ing and test data for all language pairs. The major
part of data comes from current and upcoming full
releases of the Europarl data set (Koehn, 2005).
2.1 Description of the Data
The data used in this year?s shared task was similar
to the data used in last year?s shared task. This year?s
data included training and development sets for the
News Commentary data, which was the surprise out-
of-domain test set last year.
The majority of the training data for the Spanish,
French, and German tasks was drawn from a new
version of the Europarl multilingual corpus. Addi-
tional training data was taken from the News Com-
mentary corpus. Czech language resources were
drawn from the News Commentary data. Additional
resources for Czech came from the CzEng Paral-
lel Corpus (Bojar and Z?abokrtsky?, 2006). Overall,
there are over 30 million words of training data per
language from the Europarl corpus and 1 million
words from the News Commentary corpus. Figure 1
provides some statistics about the corpora used this
year.
2.2 Baseline system
To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition,
we provided a complete baseline MT system, along
with data resources. To summarize, we provided:
? sentence-aligned training corpora
? development and dev-test sets
? language models trained for each language
? an open source decoder for phrase-based SMT
called Moses (Koehn et al, 2006), which re-
places the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004)
? a training script to build models for Moses
The performance of this baseline system is similar
to the best submissions in last year?s shared task.
2.3 Test Data
The test data was again drawn from a segment of
the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000,
which is excluded from the training data. Partici-
pants were also provided with three sets of parallel
text to be used for system development and tuning.
In addition to the Europarl test set, we also col-
lected editorials from the Project Syndicate web-
site1, which are published in all the five languages
of the shared task. We aligned the texts at a sentence
level across all five languages, resulting in 2,007
sentences per language. For statistics on this test set,
refer to Figure 1.
The News Commentary test set differs from the
Europarl data in various ways. The text type are ed-
itorials instead of speech transcripts. The domain is
general politics, economics and science. However, it
is also mostly political content (even if not focused
on the internal workings of the European Union) and
opinion.
2.4 Participants
We received submissions from 15 groups from 14

increase over last year?s shared task where submis-
sions were received from 14 groups from 11 insti-
tutions. Of the 11 groups that participated in last
year?s shared task, 6 groups returned this year.
This year, most of these groups follow a phrase-
based statistical approach to machine translation.
However, several groups submitted results from sys-
tems that followed a hybrid approach.
While building a machine translation system is a
serious undertaking we hope to attract more new-
comers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry
as low as possible. The creation of parallel corpora
such as the Europarl, the CzEng, and the News Com-
mentary corpora should help in this direction by pro-
viding freely available language resources for build-
ing systems. The creation of an open source baseline
system should also go a long way towards achieving
this goal.
For more on the participating systems, please re-
fer to the respective system description in the pro-
ceedings of the workshop.
3 Human evaluation
We evaluated the shared task submissions using both
manual evaluation and automatic metrics. While
automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the
day-to-day development of machine translation sys-
tems, they are an imperfect substitute for human
assessment of translation quality. Manual evalua-
tion is time consuming and expensive to perform,
so comprehensive comparisons of multiple systems
are rare. For our manual evaluation we distributed
the workload across a number of people, including
participants in the shared task, interested volunteers,
and a small number of paid annotators. More than
100 people participated in the manual evaluation,
with 75 of those people putting in at least an hour?s
worth of effort. A total of 330 hours of labor was in-
vested, nearly doubling last year?s all-volunteer ef-
fort which yielded 180 hours of effort.
Beyond simply ranking the shared task submis-
sions, we had a number of scientific goals for the
manual evaluation. Firstly, we wanted to collect
data which could be used to assess how well au-
tomatic metrics correlate with human judgments.
Secondly, we wanted to examine different types of
manual evaluation and assess which was the best.
A number of criteria could be adopted for choos-
ing among different types of manual evaluation: the
ease with which people are able to perform the task,
their agreement with other annotators, their reliabil-
ity when asked to repeat judgments, or the number
of judgments which can be collected in a fixed time
period.
There are a range of possibilities for how human
139
evaluation of machine translation can be done. For
instance, it can be evaluated with reading compre-
hension tests (Jones et al, 2005), or by assigning
subjective scores to the translations of individual
sentences (LDC, 2005). We examined three differ-
ent ways of manually evaluating machine translation
quality:
? Assigning scores based on five point adequacy
and fluency scales
? Ranking translated sentences relative to each
other
? Ranking the translations of syntactic con-
stituents drawn from the source sentence
3.1 Fluency and adequacy
The most widely used methodology when manually
evaluatingMT is to assign values from two five point
scales representing fluency and adequacy. These
scales were developed for the annual NIST Machine
Translation Evaluation Workshop by the Linguistics
Data Consortium (LDC, 2005).
The five point scale for adequacy indicates how
much of the meaning expressed in the reference
translation is also expressed in a hypothesis trans-
lation:
5 = All
4 = Most
3 = Much
2 = Little
1 = None
The second five point scale indicates how fluent
the translation is. When translating into English the
values correspond to:
5 = Flawless English
4 = Good English
3 = Non-native English
2 = Disfluent English
1 = Incomprehensible
Separate scales for fluency and adequacy were
developed under the assumption that a translation
might be disfluent but contain all the information
from the source. However, in principle it seems that
people have a hard time separating these two as-
pects of translation. The high correlation between
people?s fluency and adequacy scores (given in Ta-
bles 17 and 18) indicate that the distinction might be
false.

Figure 2: In constituent-based evaluation, the source
sentence was parsed, and automatically aligned with
the reference translation and systems? translations
Another problem with the scores is that there are
no clear guidelines on how to assign values to trans-
lations. No instructions are given to evaluators in
terms of how to quantify meaning, or how many
grammatical errors (or what sort) separates the dif-
ferent levels of fluency. Because of this many judges
either develop their own rules of thumb, or use the
scales as relative rather than absolute. These are
borne out in our analysis of inter-annotator agree-
ment in Section 6.
3.2 Ranking translations of sentences
Because fluency and adequacy were seemingly diffi-
cult things for judges to agree on, and because many
people from last year?s workshop seemed to be using
them as a way of ranking translations, we decided to
try a separate evaluation where people were simply
140
asked to rank translations. The instructions for this
task were:
Rank each whole sentence translation
from Best to Worst relative to the other
choices (ties are allowed).
These instructions were just as minimal as for flu-
ency and adequacy, but the task was considerably
simplified. Rather than having to assign each trans-
lation a value along an arbitrary scale, people simply
had to compare different translations of a single sen-
tence and rank them.
3.3 Ranking translations of syntactic
constituents
In addition to having judges rank the translations
of whole sentences, we also conducted a pilot
study of a new type of evaluation methodology,
which we call constituent-based evaluation. In our
constituent-based evaluation we parsed the source
language sentence, selected constituents from the
tree, and had people judge the translations of those
syntactic phrases. In order to draw judges? attention
to these regions, we highlighted the selected source
phrases and the corresponding phrases in the transla-
tions. The corresponding phrases in the translations
were located via automatic word alignments.
Figure 2 illustrates the constituent based evalu-
ation when applied to a German source sentence.
The German source sentence is parsed, and vari-
ous phrases are selected for evaluation. Word align-
ments are created between the source sentence and
the reference translation (shown), and the source
sentence and each of the system translations (not
shown). We parsed the test sentences for each of
the languages aside from Czech. We used Cowan
and Collins (2005)?s parser for Spanish, Arun and
Keller (2005)?s for French, Dubey (2005)?s for Ger-
man, and Bikel (2002)?s for English.
The word alignments were created with Giza++
(Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus
containing 200,000 sentence pairs of the training
data, plus sets of 4,007 sentence pairs created by
pairing the test sentences with the reference transla-
tions, and the test sentences paired with each of the
system translations. The phrases in the translations
were located using techniques from phrase-based
statistical machine translation which extract phrase
pairs fromword alignments (Koehn et al, 2003; Och
and Ney, 2004). Because the word-alignments were
created automatically, and because the phrase ex-
traction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected
may not exactly correspond to the translations of the
selected source phrase. We noted this in the instruc-
tions to judges:
Rank each constituent translation from
Best to Worst relative to the other choices
(ties are allowed). Grade only the high-
lighted part of each translation.
Please note that segments are selected au-
tomatically, and they should be taken as
an approximate guide. They might in-
clude extra words that are not in the actual
alignment, or miss words on either end.
The criteria that we used to select which con-
stituents were to be evaluated were:
? The constituent could not be the whole source
sentence
? The constituent had to be longer three words,
and be no longer than 15 words
? The constituent had to have a corresponding
phrase with a consistent word alignment in
each of the translations
The final criterion helped reduce the number of
alignment errors.
3.4 Collecting judgments
We collected judgments using a web-based tool.
Shared task participants were each asked to judge
200 sets of sentences. The sets consisted of 5 sys-
tem outputs, as shown in Figure 3. The judges
were presented with batches of each type of eval-
uation. We presented them with five screens of ade-
quacy/fluency scores, five screens of sentence rank-
ings, and ten screens of constituent rankings. The
order of the types of evaluation were randomized.
In order to measure intra-annotator agreement
10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twice
by each judge. In order to measure inter-annotator
agreement 40% of the items were randomly drawn
from a common pool that was shared across all

annotators so that we would have items that were
judged by multiple annotators.
Judges were allowed to select whichever data set
they wanted, and to evaluate translations into what-
ever languages they were proficient in. Shared task
participants were excluded from judging their own
systems.
Table 2 gives a summary of the number of judg-
ments that we collected for translations of individ-
ual sentences. Since we had 14 translation tasks and
four different types of scores, there were 55 differ-
ent conditions.2 In total we collected over 81,000
judgments. Despite the large number of conditions
we managed to collect more than 1,000 judgments
for most of them. This provides a rich source of data
for analyzing the quality of translations produced by
different systems, the different types of human eval-
uation, and the correlation of automatic metrics with
human judgments.3
2We did not perform a constituent-based evaluation for
Czech to English because we did not have a syntactic parser
for Czech. We considered adapting our method to use Bojar
(2004)?s dependency parser for Czech, but did not have the time.
3The judgment data along with all system translations are
available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/
4 Automatic evaluation
The past two ACL workshops on machine trans-
lation used Bleu as the sole automatic measure of
translation quality. Bleu was used exclusively since
it is the most widely used metric in the field and
has been shown to correlate with human judgments
of translation quality in many instances (Dodding-
ton, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Przybocki, 2004). How-
ever, recent work suggests that Bleu?s correlation
with human judgments may not be as strong as pre-
viously thought (Callison-Burch et al, 2006). The
results of last year?s workshop further suggested that
Bleu systematically underestimated the quality of
rule-based machine translation systems (Koehn and
Monz, 2006).
We used the manual evaluation data as a means of
testing the correlation of a range of automatic met-
rics in addition to Bleu. In total we used eleven
different automatic evaluation measures to rank the
shared task submissions. They are:

against a reference. It flexibly matches words
using stemming and WordNet synonyms. Its
flexible matching was extended to French,
Spanish, German and Czech for this workshop
(Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).
? Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002)?Bleu is currently
the de facto standard in machine translation
evaluation. It calculates n-gram precision and
a brevity penalty, and can make use of multi-
ple reference translations as a way of capturing
some of the allowable variation in translation.
We use a single reference translation in our ex-
periments.
? GTM (Melamed et al, 2003)?GTM general-
izes precision, recall, and F-measure to mea-
sure overlap between strings, rather than over-
lap between bags of items. An ?exponent? pa-
rameter which controls the relative importance
of word order. A value of 1.0 reduces GTM to
ordinary unigram overlap, with higher values
emphasizing order.4
? Translation Error Rate (Snover et al, 2006)?
4The GTM scores presented here are an F-measure with a
weight of 0.1, which counts recall at 10x the level of precision.
The exponent is set at 1.2, which puts a mild preference towards
items with words in the correct order. These parameters could
be optimized empirically for better results.
TER calculates the number of edits required to
change a hypothesis translation into a reference
translation. The possible edits in TER include
insertion, deletion, and substitution of single
words, and an edit which moves sequences of
contiguous words.
? ParaEval precision and ParaEval recall (Zhou
et al, 2006)?ParaEval matches hypothesis and
reference translations using paraphrases that
are extracted from parallel corpora in an unsu-
pervised fashion (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005). It calculates precision and recall using a
unigram counting strategy.
? Dependency overlap (Amigo? et al, 2006)?
This metric uses dependency trees for the hy-
pothesis and reference translations, by comput-
ing the average overlap between words in the
two trees which are dominated by grammatical
relationships of the same type.
? Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,
2007)?This metric calculates the lexical over-
lap between semantic roles (i.e., semantic argu-
ments or adjuncts) of the same type in the the
hypothesis and reference translations. It uni-
formly averages lexical overlap over all seman-
tic role types.

? Maximum correlation training on adequacy and
on fluency (Liu and Gildea, 2007)?a lin-
ear combination of different evaluation metrics
(Bleu, Meteor, Rouge, WER, and stochastic it-
erative alignment) with weights set to maxi-
mize Pearson?s correlation with adequacy and
fluency judgments. Weights were trained on
WMT-06 data.
The scores produced by these are given in the ta-
bles at the end of the paper, and described in Sec-
tion 5. We measured the correlation of the automatic
evaluation metrics with the different types of human
judgments on 12 data conditions, and report these in
Section 6.
5 Shared task results
The results of the human evaluation are given in Ta-
bles 9, 10, 11 and 12. Each of those tables present
four scores:
? FLUENCY and ADEQUACY are normalized ver-
sions of the five point scores described in Sec-
tion 3.1. The tables report an average of the
normalized scores.5
? RANK is the average number of times that a
system was judged to be better than any other
system in the sentence ranking evaluation de-
scribed in Section 3.2.
? CONSTITUENT is the average number of times
that a system was judged to be better than any
other system in the constituent-based evalua-
tion described in Section 3.3.
There was reasonably strong agreement between
these four measures at which of the entries was the
best in each data condition. There was complete

sign fluency and adequacy scores, we normalized these scores
on a per-judge basis using the method suggested by Blatz et al
(2003) in Chapter 5, page 97.

While we consider the human evaluation to be
primary, it is also interesting to see how the en-
tries were ranked by the various automatic evalua-
tion metrics. The complete set of results for the auto-
matic evaluation are presented in Tables 13, 14, 15,
and 16. An aggregate summary is provided in Table
4. The automatic evaluation metrics strongly favor
the University of Edinburgh, which garners 41% of
the top-ranked entries (which is partially due to the
fact it was entered in every language pair). Signif-
icantly, the automatic metrics disprefer SYSTRAN,
which was strongly favored in the human evaluation.
6 Meta-evaluation
In addition to evaluating the translation quality of
the shared task entries, we also performed a ?meta-
evaluation? of our evaluation methodologies.
6.1 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreement
We measured pairwise agreement among annotators
using the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely used
in computational linguistics for measuring agree-
ment in category judgments (Carletta, 1996). It is
defined as
K =
P (A)? P (E)
1? P (E)
where P (A) is the proportion of times that the an-
notators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of time
that they would agree by chance. We define chance
agreement for fluency and adequacy as 15 , since they
are based on five point scales, and for ranking as 13
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Fluency (absolute) .630 .2 .537
Adequacy (absolute) .574 .2 .468
Fluency (relative) .690 .333 .535
Adequacy (relative) .696 .333 .544
Sentence ranking .749 .333 .623
Constituent ranking .825 .333 .738
Constituent ranking .842 .333 .762
(w/identical constituents)
Table 6: Kappa coefficient values for intra-annotator
agreement for the different types of manual evalua-
tion
since there are three possible out comes when rank-
ing the output of a pair of systems: A > B, A = B,
A < B.
For inter-annotator agreement we calculated
P (A) for fluency and adequacy by examining all
items that were annotated by two or more annota-
tors, and calculating the proportion of time they as-
signed identical scores to the same items. For the
ranking tasks we calculated P (A) by examining all
pairs of systems which had been judged by two or
more judges, and calculated the proportion of time
that they agreed that A > B, A = B, or A < B.
For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but
gathered items that were annotated on multiple oc-
casions by a single annotator.
Table 5 gives K values for inter-annotator agree-
ment, and Table 6 gives K values for intra-annoator
agreement. These give an indication of how often
different judges agree, and how often single judges
are consistent for repeated judgments, respectively.
The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according to
Landis and Koch (1977) 0??.2 is slight, .21??.4
is fair, .41??.6 is moderate, .61??.8 is substantial
and the rest almost perfect.
The K values for fluency and adequacy should
give us pause about using these metrics in the fu-
ture. When we analyzed them as they are intended to
be?scores classifying the translations of sentences
into different types?the inter-annotator agreement
was barely considered fair, and the intra-annotator
agreement was only moderate. Even when we re-
assessed fluency and adequacy as relative ranks the
agreements increased only minimally.

Figure 4: Distributions of the amount of time it took
to judge single sentences for the three types of man-
ual evaluation
The agreement on the other two types of man-
ual evaluation that we introduced were considerably
better. The both the sentence and constituent ranking
had moderate inter-annotator agreement and sub-
stantial intra-annotator agreement. Because the con-
stituent ranking examined the translations of short
phrases, often times all systems produced the same
translations. Since these trivially increased agree-
ment (since they would always be equally ranked)
we also evaluated the inter- and intra-annotator
agreement when those items were excluded. The
agreement remained very high for constituent-based
evaluation.
6.2 Timing
We used the web interface to collect timing infor-
mation. The server recorded the time when a set of
sentences was given to a judge and the time when
the judge returned the sentences. We divided the
time that it took to do a set by the number of sen-
tences in the set. The average amount of time that it
took to assign fluency and adequacy to a single sen-
tence was 26 seconds.6 The average amount of time
it took to rank a sentence in a set was 20 seconds.
The average amount of time it took to rank a high-
lighted constituent was 11 seconds. Figure 4 shows
the distribution of times for these tasks.
6Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from
these calculations, because there was a strong chance that anno-
tators were interrupted while completing the task.
These timing figures are promising because they
indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the
most reliable on (constituent ranking and sentence
ranking) were also much quicker to complete than
the ones that they were unreliable on (assigning flu-
ency and adequacy scores). This suggests that flu-
ency and adequacy should be replaced with ranking
tasks in future evaluation exercises.
6.3 Correlation between automatic metrics and
human judgments
To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics
with the human judgments of translation quality we
used Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient ?. We
opted for Spearman rather than Pearson because it
makes fewer assumptions about the data. Impor-
tantly, it can be applied to ordinal data (such as the
fluency and adequacy scales). Spearman?s rank cor-
relation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson correla-
tion on ranks.
After the raw scores that were assigned to systems
by an automatic metric and by one of our manual
evaluation techniques have been converted to ranks,
we can calculate ? using the simplified equation:
? = 1?
6
?
d2i
n(n2 ? 1)
where di is the difference between the rank for
systemi and n is the number of systems. The pos-
sible values of ? range between 1 (where all systems
are ranked in the same order) and?1 (where the sys-
tems are ranked in the reverse order). Thus an auto-
matic evaluation metric with a higher value for ? is
making predictions that are more similar to the hu-
man judgments than an automatic evaluation metric
with a lower ?.
Table 17 reports ? for the metrics which were
used to evaluate translations into English.7. Table
7 summarizes the results by averaging the correla-
tion numbers by equally weighting each of the data
conditions. The table ranks the automatic evalua-
tion metrics based on how well they correlated with
human judgments. While these are based on a rela-
tively few number of items, and while we have not
performed any tests to determine whether the dif-
ferences in ? are statistically significant, the results
7The Czech-English conditions were excluded since there
were so few systems
146
are nevertheless interesting, since three metrics have
higher correlation than Bleu:
? Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,
2007), which makes its debut in the proceed-
ings of this workshop
? ParaEval measuring recall (Zhou et al, 2006),
which has a model of allowable variation in
translation that uses automatically generated
paraphrases (Callison-Burch, 2007)
? Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) which also
allows variation by introducing synonyms and
by flexibly matches words using stemming.
Tables 18 and 8 report ? for the six metrics which
were used to evaluate translations into the other lan-
guages. Here we find that Bleu and TER are the
closest to human judgments, but that overall the cor-
relations are much lower than for translations into
English.
7 Conclusions
Similar to last year?s workshop we carried out an ex-
tensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine
translation performance for translating from four
European languages into English, and vice versa.
This year we substantially increased the number of
automatic evaluation metrics and were also able to
nearly double the efforts of producing the human
judgments.
There were substantial differences in the results
results of the human and automatic evaluations. We
take the human judgments to be authoritative, and
used them to evaluate the automatic metrics. We
measured correlation using Spearman?s coefficient
and found that three less frequently used metrics
were stronger predictors of human judgments than
Bleu. They were: semantic role overlap (newly in-
troduced in this workshop) ParaEval-recall and Me-
teor.
Although we do not claim that our observations
are indisputably conclusive, they again indicate that
the choice of automatic metric can have a signifi-
cant impact on comparing systems. Understanding
the exact causes of those differences still remains an
important issue for future research.

This year?s evaluation also measured the agree-
ment between human assessors by computing the
Kappa coefficient. One striking observation is
that inter-annotator agreement for fluency and ad-
equacy can be called ?fair? at best. On the other
hand, comparing systems by ranking them manually
(constituents or entire sentences), resulted in much
higher inter-annotator agreement.
