Abstract
In this paper, we detail a method for do-
main specific, multi-category emotion recog-
nition, based on human computation. We cre-
ate an Amazon Mechanical Turk1 task that
elicits emotion labels and phrase-emotion as-
sociations from the participants. Using the
proposed method, we create an emotion lex-
icon, compatible with the 20 emotion cate-
gories of the Geneva Emotion Wheel. GEW
is the first computational resource that can be
used to assign emotion labels with such a high
level of granularity. Our emotion annotation
method also produced a corpus of emotion la-
beled sports tweets. We compared the cross-
validated version of the lexicon with existing
resources for both the positive/negative and
multi-emotion classification problems. We
show that the presented domain-targeted lex-
icon outperforms the existing general purpose
ones in both settings. The performance gains
are most pronounced for the fine-grained emo-
tion classification, where we achieve an accu-
racy twice higher than the benchmark.2
1 Introduction
Social media platforms such as Twitter.com have be-
come a common way for people to share opinions
and emotions. Sports events are traditionally ac-
companied by strong emotions and the 2012 summer
Olympic Games in London were not an exception.
In this paper we describe methods to analyze and
data mine the emotional content of tweets about this

event using human computation. Our goal is to cre-
ate an emotion recognition method, capable of clas-
sifying domain specific emotions with a high emo-
tion granularity. In the stated case, domain speci-
ficity refers not only to the sport event, but also to
the Twitter environment.
We focus on the categorical representation of
emotions because it allows a more fine-grained anal-
ysis and it is more natural for humans. In daily life
we use emotion names to describe specific feelings
rather than give numerical evaluations or specify po-
larity. So far, the multi-item emotion classification
problem has received much less attention.
One reason is that high quality training corpora
are difficult to construct largely due to the cost of hu-
man annotators. Further, if emotion representation
is not carefully designed, the annotator agreement
can be very low. The higher the number of consid-
ered emotions is, the more difficult it is for humans
to agree on a label for a given text. Low quality
labeling leads to difficulties in extracting powerful
classification features. This problem is further com-
pounded in parsimonious environments, like Twit-
ter, where the short text leads to a lack of emotional
cues. All this presents challenges in developing a
high-quality emotion recognition system operating
with a fine-grained emotion category set within a
chosen domain.
In this paper, we show how to tackle the above
challenges through human computation, using an
online labor market such as the Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk or AMT (Snow et al, 2008). To overcome
the possible difficulties in annotation we employ a
well-designed emotion assessment tool, the Geneva
12
Emotion Wheel (GEW) (Scherer, 2005). Having 20
separate emotion categories, it provides a desirable
high level of emotion granularity. In a given task, we
show the annotators the tweets, related to the afore-
mentioned sports event, and ask them to classify the
tweets? emotional content into one of the provided
emotion categories. The action sequence requires
them to both label the tweets and to specify the tex-
tual constructs that support their decision. We view
the selected textual constructs as probable classifi-
cation features. The proposed method thus simul-
taneously produces an emotion annotated corpus of
tweets and creates an emotion lexicon. The resulting
weighted emotion lexicon is a list of phrases indica-
tive of emotion presence. It consists solely of ones
selected by respondents, while their weights were
learnt based on their occurrence in the constructed
Sports-Related Emotion Corpus (SREC).
We show that the human-based lexicon is well
suited for the particularities of the chosen environ-
ment, and also for an emotion model with a high
number of categories. Firstly, we show that domain
specificity matters, and that non-specialists, using
their common sense, can extract features that are
useful in classification. We use the resulting lexi-
con, OlympLex, in a binary polarity classification
problem on the domain data and show that it outper-
forms several traditional lexicons.
In multi-emotion classification, we show that it
is highly accurate in classifying tweets into 20
emotion categories of the Geneva Emotion Wheel
(GEW) (Scherer, 2005). As a baseline for compar-
ison we use the Geneva wheel compatible lexicon,
the Geneva Affect Label Coder (GALC) (Scherer,
2005). The experiments show that OlympLex sig-
nificantly outperforms this baseline.
Such a detailed emotion representation allows us
to create an accurate description of the sentiment the
chosen event evokes in its viewers. For instance, we
find that Pride is the dominant emotion, and that it
is 2.3 times more prevalent than Anger.
2 Related Work
GEW Emotion Representation Model In our
work we used the emotion categories from the
Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW, version 2.0). GEW
was developed as a tool for obtaining self-reports of
emotional experience with a goal to structure the ex-
haustive list of possible emotion names used in free-
format self-reports with minimal loss in expressibil-
ity. It presents 20 (10 positive/10 negative) emo-
tion categories frequently answered in free-format
self-reports as main options. Each emotion category
is represented by two common emotion names to
emphasize its family nature (e.g. Happiness/Joy3).
These categories are arranged on the circle follow-
ing the underlying 2-dimensional space of valence
(positive-negative) and control (high-low). Several
levels of intensity for each emotion category are pre-
sented as answer options. Also, 2 other answers are
possible: No emotion and Other emotion with free-
format input in the latter case.
Compared to raw dimensional models where
emotion states are described as points in space (e.g.
Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance model, PAD (Mehra-
bian, 1996)) GEW has an advantage of categorical
representation where emotion state is described in
terms of discrete set of emotion names. It allows
humans to measure their emotions in terms of emo-
tion names they accustomed to instead of unnat-
ural numerical measurements. Among commonly
used emotion categories sets GEW categories are the
most fine-grained, compared, for instance, to Ek-
man?s (1992) or Plutchik?s (1980) basic emotions.
While these models have been popular in emotion
recognition research, their main shortcoming is their
limited items. In sports events, fans and spectators
not only feel strong emotions, but also likely want to
express them in multitudes of expressions. Pride/E-
lation, Envy/Jealousy are just two examples that are
missed in those models with basic emotions.
Lexical Resources Emotion recognition is closely
related to the positive/negative sentiment classifica-
tion. In a traditional approach the units defining the
polarity of the text are polarity-bearing terms. A list
of such terms with corresponding polarity label or
score forms a polarity lexicon. Commonly used ex-
amples of polarity lexicons include GI (Stone et al,
1968), Bing Liu?s lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004), and
OpinionFinder (Wilson et al, 2009).
Similarly, emotion lexicons can be defined as
lists of terms bearing emotions with their corre-
3In the paper text we often use one name per category for
brevity reasons
13
sponding emotion information. Depending on the
construction methods, they can be separated into
those that constructed manually (GALC (Scherer,
2005)), semi-automatically (WordNet-Affect (Strap-
parava and Valitutti, 2004)) or via human computa-
tion (ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), NRC (Mo-
hammad and Turney, 2010; Mohammad and Turney,
2012)). Our work is most closely related to the NRC
lexicon which was also extracted via human compu-
tation on AMT. The authors developed a task where,
for a given term, the annotators rated to what extent
the term is associated to each emotion of Plutchik?s
set. In contrast, in our work, we harvest emotional
labels and features in context. The terms are associ-
ated with emotions in the context of the tweet they
appear in. We use the approach suggested by (Aman
and Szpakowicz, 2007) where humans are asked to
select an excerpt of the text expressing emotion.
Moreover, we ask the annotators for additional inter-
changeable, emotional expressions for the same sit-
uation. Lexicons obtained from unsupervised learn-
ing methods using automatically annotated Twitter
data (Mohammad, 2012) have also been proposed,
but their performance has been shown to be inferior
to benchmarks such as NRC.
The underlying emotion representation model dif-
fers from one emotion lexicon to another. For in-
stance, ANEW uses the PAD dimensions, Plutchik?s
basic categories are used by NRC and Ekman?s cat-
egories in WordNet-Affect. However, such repre-
sentations do not provide a sufficient emotion gran-
ularity level. There is only one lexicon which incor-
porates GEW emotion model: the GALC (Scherer,
2005) lexicon. It contains 279 unigram stems (e.g.
happ*) explicitly expressing one of 36 emotion cate-
gories (covering all GEW categories). We use there-
fore this lexicon for benchmarking.
The main differences of our lexicon compared to
its predecessors lie in the usage of new fine-grained
emotion set, new methods of human computation
employed in its construction and specificity to the
context of Twitter posts and sport-related emotions.
3 Emotional Labeling and Emotion
Feature Elicitation
We created a Human Computation method, using
the online labor market (Amazon Mechanical Turk
or AMT) to simultaneously accomplish two goals.
The first is to have a reliable, human annotation of
the emotions within a text corpus. The second is to
enable the respondents to provide us with the fea-
tures needed to construct an emotion lexicon. In this
section we describe the processes of data selection,
annotation, and refinement, as well as provide the
statistical description of the obtained data.
3.1 Data Collection
Our goal is to analyze the emotions of the spectators
of Olympic games. We consider the tweets about the
Olympics posted during the 2012 Olympic games as
a data source for this analysis. We assume that the
same emotions are expressed in the same way for all
the sports. We thus narrow the scope of our analysis
to a single sport ? gymnastics.
Traditionally, the gymnastics teams from the USA
have strong bid for victory. Thus, we assume that a
large group of English-speaking nation may be in-
terested in it. Then, gymnastics is a dynamic type of
sport where each moment of performance can play
a crucial role in final results, enhancing the emo-
tional experience in audience. Also, it is less com-
mon than, for instance, running or swimming, thus
the occurrence of this term in tweets, at the time of
the Olympics, will more likely signal a reference to
the Olympic gymnasts.
We used the hashtag #gymnastics (hashtags rep-
resent topics in tweets) to obtain the tweets related
to the gymnastic competitions during the Olympics
time resulting in 199, 730 such tweets. An emo-
tional example is ?Well done #gymnastics we have
a SILVER yeayyyyyyyyy!!!! Wohoooo?.
3.2 Annotation Process
We developed a Human-Intelligence Task (HIT) on
the AMT for annotation of a subset of the collected
tweets with emotion-related information.
3.2.1 Task description
One HIT consisted of the annotation of one pre-
sented tweet. A worker was asked to read a tweet
text and to fulfill the following subtasks:
Subtask 1 Decide on the dominant emotion the
author of the tweet felt in the moment of its writ-
ing (emotion label) and how strong it was (emotion
strength). Even though an emotion mixture could

aonly among answers where non-neutral emotion label is assigned
be felt, a worker had to choose one emotion that pre-
vailed all others. This kept him focused on one main
emotion in the subtasks 2 and 3. To elicit this in-
formation we employed the Geneva Emotion Wheel
(GEW) described in the Related Work with minor
changes: we used 3 strength labels (low, medium
and high) instead of 5 in initial version. The set of
emotion categories remained unchanged: 20 GEW
emotion categories plus 2 additional answer options:
No emotion and Other emotion. We required work-
ers to type the emotion name in latter case.
Subtask 2 In case an emotion was present,
a worker was then asked to choose the excerpts of
the tweet indicating its presence, the (tweet emotion
indicators). She was asked to find all the expres-
sions of the chosen emotion present in the tweet text.
It could be one word, emoticon, or subsequence of
the tweet words. We asked her to also include the
words modifying the strength of emotion (e.g. to
choose so excited instead of excited).
Subtask 3 Input additional emotion indicators of
chosen emotion. Similarly to the previous subtask,
a worker was asked to input the textual expressions
of the chosen emotion. However, in this case the
expressions had to be not from the tweet text, but
generated based on personal experience. E.g. she
could state that she uses poor thing to express Pity.
3.2.2 HIT Iterations
The design of annotation schema and correspond-
ing instructions as well as search for the optimal HIT
parameters took several iterations. Table 1 contains
the statistics on inter-annotator agreements and on
the number of provided emotion indicators for each
iteration. Beside emotion agreement, we also con-
sider polarity agreement. The polarity label of an
answer is defined as the polarity of its emotion label.
No emotion implies a Neutral polarity. For answers
with Other emotion we manually detected their po-
larity based on provided emotion name if applicable,
or set Neutral polarity otherwise.
Iteration 1 Firstly, we annotated 200 tweets (set
S1), using respondents within our laboratory, into
a set of 12 emotion categories (SportEm) which
we considered first to be representative for the emo-
tions incited by sport events: Love, Pride, Excite-
ment, Positive Surprise, Joy, Like, Other Positive,
Anger/Hate, Shame, Anxiety, Shock, Sadness, Dis-
like, Other Negative. For each tweet an annota-
tor gave the emotion label and chose corresponding
tweet emotion indicators. The tweets of S1 included
both tweets with predefined emotional words and
without. The details of selection process are omit-
ted due to space limitations.
Iteration 2 We launched two batches of HITs on
AMT: Ball and Ben. A HIT batch is defined by a
set of tweets to label, with some parameters specific
for AMT, such as the number of different workers
for each tweet (we used 4 in all our experiments),
the payment for one HIT, or specific worker require-
ments, (e.g. for Ben we also required that workers
should be from the U.S.). We grouped 25 tweets
from S1 with HIT payment of $0.05 in Ben, whereas
for Ball we included only 10 tweets with payment
of $0.03. The annotation schema used the emotions
of SportEm. For each tweet an annotator gave the
emotion label and provided tweet emotion indica-
tors. The field for additional emotion indicators in-
put was presented as optional.
We discovered that the answers in Ball had an un-
acceptable quality, with a low agreement and many
impossible labels. This can be explained either by
lower understanding of English or less reliability of
workers from all around the world compared to the
U.S. workers. Consequently, all our next iterations
had the requirement on workers to be from the U.S.
Iteration 3 We launched a new HIT batch to an-
15
notate the full S1 with emotions from SportEm.
Starting with this iteration, the payment was set to
$0.04. The additional emotion indicators field was
shown as compulsory. The experiment showed that
AMT workers generally followed the instructions
achieving emotion agreement only slightly worse
than ours.
Iteration 4 We decided to use the more fine-
grained and well researched GEW emotion cate-
gories. Thus, we launched another HIT batch to
annotate S1 again, in terms of GEW emotion cat-
egories (with a schema given in Task Description).
Even though a new task contained more answer op-
tions emotion agreement stayed in the same range
between 0.25 and 0.3.
Iteration 5 We launched a final batch with the
described GEW schema to annotate more tweets.
We selected Olympics related tweets that had a high
likelihood of being emotional. We first selected
tweets using the emotion indicators obtained during
the previous iterations and found more than 5 times
in the collected corpus (418 terms). For each key-
word in this list we extracted up to 3 tweets contain-
ing this term (1244 tweets). In addition, we added
the tweets without keywords from the list, but posted
by the users who used these emotional keywords
in their other tweets, supposing that these users are
more likely to express their emotions. Overall, 1800
tweets were selected, but 13 were excluded because
they were not written in English.
The resulting corpus contains the data gathered
during the iterations 4 and 5. It consists of 1987
tweets annotated each by 4 workers with emotion
label, emotion strength, and related emotion indica-
tors. The Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) for emotion la-
bels is 0.24 which is considered to be fair by Landis
and Koch (1977), but quite low compared to usual
kappa values in other tasks (e.g. polarity annotation
usually has Kappa in a range of 0.7?0.8). We con-
clude that the annotation in terms of multi-category
emotions is highly subjective and ambiguous task,
confirming our assumptions on existence of emotion
mixtures.
3.3 Quality Control
The results of crowdsourcing usually require addi-
tional refinement. The workers who give malicious
answers intentionally or due to lack of understand-
ing worsen the data quality. We detect such workers
automatically using the following 2 criteria:
Average Polarity Conformity A worker?s answer
has a polarity conformity of 1 if at least one worker
indicated the same polarity for the same tweet (0
otherwise). A worker?s average polarity conformity
is computed from all his answers. This criterion
aims to detect the workers who repeatedly disagree
with other workers.
Dominant Emotion Frequency The dominant
emotion of a worker is the one which appears most
frequently in his answers. The dominant emotion
frequency, among the worker?s answers, is the cri-
terion value. This criterion aims to detect workers
biased towards specific emotion.
A worker who has the average polarity conformity
below a predefined threshold or the dominant emo-
tion frequency above a threshold is considered to
have an insufficient quality and all his answers are
excluded from the corpus. The threshold for each
criterion is computed as a percentile of an approxi-
mated normal distribution of workers criterion val-
ues for probability limit of 0.01.
To increase the confidence in the computed cri-
teria values, we establish a minimum number of
tweets Tmin any worker should annotate to be sub-
jected to the criteria. To establish this number for
each criterion, we use the following algorithm:
Let Xn(w) be the criterion value computed using
only first n answers of worker w in order of their
submission. For each worker we detect Nmin(w) ?
the minimum number of answers after which the cri-
terion value stops varying greatly:
|Xn(w)?Xn?1(w)| ? 0.05, ?n ? Nmin(w) (1)
We then compute Tmin as the ceiling of the average
value of of Nmin(w) among workers who annotated
at least 20 tweets.
The described procedure on detection of bad
workers allowed the analysis of 83% of the answers.
Using it, we excluded 8 workers, with their corre-
sponding 260 answers.
In addition to removing these workers, we also
excluded malicious answers: 736 answers that had a
polarity conformity of 0. This additional filter was
applied to all the remaining answers from the previ-
ous method. We also excluded the 121 answers with
16
Other emotion and the answers for 12 tweets, that
were left with only 1 answer by this stage.
As a result of quality control, there were excluded
14.2% of initial answers. Overall, 1957 tweets with
corresponding 6819 annotations remained (3.48 an-
swers per tweet in average). These answers compose
the final Sport-Related Emotion Corpus (SREC).
3.4 Emotion distribution in SREC
To provide a glimpse of the data we present the dis-
tribution of emotion categories among all answers in
the figure 1. The most frequently answered emotion
category was Pride, followed by Involvement. These
emotions are natural in the context of sport events,
however course-grained emotion models could not
distinguish them. It highlights the advantage of fine-
grained GEW emotion set to express the subtleties
of the domain.

swers (after application of quality control)
4 Emotion Recognition Model
The output of our emotion recognition method is the
distribution of emotions within a text, in terms of
GEW emotion categories. It is represented as a tuple
in the probability space
P =
{
p? = (p1, . . . , p21),
21?
i=1
pi = 1
}
(2)
where pi represents the percentage of ith emotion in
felt emotion mixture. The emotion set contains 20
GEW categories and No Emotion as 21st category.
We use a lexicon of emotion indicators, which
are words or word sequences indicative of emotion
presence. Each indicator termt has attached emo-
tion distribution tuple p?t ? P. To compute the re-
sult tuple p? for a text d we sum up all the tuples
of emotion indicators found within this text with the
number of times they were found:
p?(d) =
?
termt?d
nt(d) p?t (3)
If no indicators are present in the text, a full weight
is given to No emotion category (p21 = 1). We also
neglect all negated indicators occurrences detected
by the negation words (no, not, *n?t, never) placed
ahead of an indicator.
Lexicon Construction We construct the lexicon
by selecting the emotion indicators and computing
their emotion distributions. We use a training corpus
that has a format described in the previous section.
The training process consists of the following steps:
Among all tweet and additional emotion indica-
tors provided by workers, we select those that were
suggested more than once.
For each tweet we have several emotion labels
from the data. We determine the emotion distribu-
tion of the tweet by computing the frequency of each
emotion label over all the answers corresponding to
that tweet.
For each answer we construct a link between each
term suggested in the additional emotion indicators
field and the answer?s emotion label. This link is
represented as a tuple p? ? P with weight 1 for
linked emotion category. Then, for each detected
emotion indicator we compute its emotion distribu-
tion by averaging all the emotion distributions it ap-
peared in. This includes the emotion distributions of
the tweets where this indicator occurred without a
negation and the emotion distributions of the corre-
sponding indicator-emotion links.
We define an indicator to be ambiguous if its dom-
inant polarity (polarity having the highest sum of
the weights for corresponding emotions) has sum-
mary weight smaller than 0.75. All such terms are
removed from the result lexicon.
Result Lexicon Description Following the speci-
fied process over the full SREC data, we computed
an emotion lexicon, OlympLex, that contains 3193
terms. The ratio of positive terms to negative ones
is 7:3 (term polarity is defined as dominant polarity
of term emotion distribution). Unigrams compose
37.5% of the lexicon, bigrams ? 30.5%, all other
terms are ngrams of a higher order (up to 5).
17
5 Experimental Evaluation
We evaluated our lexicon on the SREC corpus as
a classifier, using ten-fold cross-validation to avoid
possible overfitting. The precompiled universal lex-
icons were used for benchmarking. As no training is
required, we tested them over the full data.
5.1 Polarity Classification
We considered the basic polarity classification task
with 3 classes (Positive, Negative and Neutral). We
used only 1826 tweets that have one dominant polar-
ity based on workers? answers. This dominant polar-
ity was taken as a true polarity label of a tweet.
The output polarity label of our classifier is dom-
inant polarity of found emotion distribution: a po-
larity having the highest sum of the weights for cor-
responding emotions. The output of prior sentiment
lexicons is computed analogously: we sum up the
number of found lexicon terms in the tweet text
for each emotion or polarity category (depending on
which categorization is provided by the lexicon) and
output the polarity having the highest sum value. If
two polarities have the same sum weight, the output
polarity is Neutral.
We used standard classification evaluation mea-
sures: accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. We
considered only non-neutral classes (Positive and
Negative) for precision and recall. Table 2 shows the
results of our classifier, compared with other known
sentiment lexicons. The proposed lexicon outper-
forms every other one, both in terms of accuracy and
F1-score. As it was the only lexicon fitted to the
Olympic gymnastics data, its superiority reveals the
advantage of domain-targeted lexicon construction.

5.2 Emotion Classification
We evaluated emotion recognition results in the set-
ting of a multi-label classification problem. The out-
put is a set of labels instead of a standard single
label answer. In this case, the output of the clas-
sifier (OC) was defined as a set of dominant emo-
tions in the found emotion distribution p?. This set
contained the emotions having the highest weights
pi. The set of emotion labels given for this tweet
by workers formed a true output ? a set of true la-
bels (OT ) of emotion classification. As a baseline
for multi-category emotion classification we consid-
ered the GALC lexicon (Scherer, 2005).
Multi-label Evaluation We used the standard
evaluation metrics adapted for multi-label output
(Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007). For each tweet, we
first computed the precision P = |OC?OT ||OC | , which
shows how many of emotions outputted by the clas-
sifier were correct. Then the recall R = |OC?OT ||OT | ,
which shows how many of true labels were found
by classifier, and the accuracy A = |OC?OT ||OC?OT | , which
shows how close the sets of classifier and true la-
bels were. These values were averaged among all
applicable tweets. For precision and recall we used
only the tweets with non-neutral answers in OC and
OT correspondingly (meaning that No emotion label
was not present in a set).
Table 3 shows the comparative results of our and
GALC lexicons. Compared to the GALC baseline,
our classifier has both higher precision and recall.
Higher recall is explained by the fact that our lexi-
con is larger and contains also ngram terms. In ad-
dition, it includes not only explicit emotion expres-
sions (e.g. sad or proud), but also implicit ones (e.g.
yes or mistakes).
Per-Category Evaluation Another way to evalu-
ate the output of multi-label classifier is to evaluate it
for each emotion category separately. For each cat-
egory we computed precision, recall and F1-score.

Table 4: Evaluation results at per-category level. P=precision, R=recall, F1 = F1-score
The results of this evaluation in comparison with
benchmark GALC lexicon are presented in the ta-
ble 4. Overall, our lexicon performs better on most
of the categories (12 out of 20) in terms of F1-score.
The highest F1-score is achieved for such Olympic
related emotion as Pride.
5.3 Discussion
The fact that the terms from the GALC lexicon are
found in 31% of tweets indicates that people do ex-
press their emotions explicitly with emotional terms.
However, a list of currently available explicit emo-
tional terms is not extensive. For instance, it does
not cover slang terms. Moreover, people do not
limit themselves to only explicit emotional terms.
Our lexicon constructed based on the answers pro-
vided by non-expert humans achieves a significantly
higher recall. This highlights the importance of em-
ploying the human common knowledge in the pro-
cess of extraction of emotion bearing features.
6 Conclusion
We presented a context-aware human computation
method for emotion labeling and feature extrac-
tion. We showed that inexpert annotators, using
their common sense, can successfully attach emo-
tion labels to tweets, and also extract relevant emo-
tional features. Using their answers, we carefully
constructed a linguistic resource for emotion clas-
sification. The suggested method can be reused to
construct additional lexicons for different domains.
An important aspect that differentiates our work
is the emotion granularity. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this was the first attempt to create lexical
resources for emotion classification based on the
Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), which has as many
as 20 emotion categories. This level of granularity
enabled us to capture the subtleties of the emotional
responses in the target domain, tweets regarding the
2012 summer Olympics in London. In this dataset,
we found that the prevalent emotion is Pride, a detail
which is unattainable using previous methods.
Another differentiator is that, unlike most previ-
ous approaches, we relied on human computation
for both labeling and feature extraction tasks. We
showed that human generated features can be suc-
cessfully used in emotional classification, outper-
forming various existing methods. A further differ-
ence from prior lexicons is the fact that ours was
built with a context-sensitive method. This led to
a higher accuracy on the target domain, compared to
the general purpose lexicon.
We benchmarked the cross-validated version
of created OlympLex lexicon with the existing
universal-domain lexicons for both polarity and
multi-emotion problems. In suggested settings we
showed that it can outperform general purpose lex-
icons in the binary classification due to its domain
specificity. We also obtained significant improve-
ments over the baseline GALC lexicon, which was
the only preexisting one compatible with the GEW.
However, high domain specificity of the created
lexicon and restricted variety of data used in its con-
struction implies possible limitations of its usage for
other types of data. Its porting and generalization to
other domains is one of the future directions.
