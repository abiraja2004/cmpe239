Abstract 
The role of lexical resources is often un-
derstated in NLP research. The complex-
ity of Chinese, Japanese and Korean 
(CJK) poses special challenges to devel-
opers of NLP tools, especially in the area 
of word segmentation (WS), information 
retrieval (IR), named entity extraction 
(NER), and machine translation (MT). 
These difficulties are exacerbated by the 
lack of comprehensive lexical resources, 
especially for proper nouns, and the lack 
of a standardized orthography, especially 
in Japanese. This paper summarizes some 
of the major linguistic issues in the de-
velopment NLP applications that are de-
pendent on lexical resources, and dis-
cusses the central role such resources 
should play in enhancing the accuracy of 
NLP tools. 
1 Introduction 
Developers of CJK NLP tools face various chal-
lenges, some of the major ones being: 
 
1. Identifying and processing the large number of 
orthographic variants in Japanese, and alternate 
character forms in CJK languages. 
2. The lack of easily available comprehensive 
lexical resources, especially lexical databases, 
comparable to the major European languages. 
3. The accurate conversion between Simplified 
and Traditional Chinese (Halpern and Kerman 
1999).  
4. The morphological complexity of Japanese and 
Korean. 
5. Accurate word segmentation (Emerson 2000 
and Yu et al 2000) and disambiguating am-
biguous segmentations strings (ASS) (Zhou 
and Yu 1994). 
6. The difficulty of lexeme-based retrieval and 
CJK CLIR (Goto et al 2001). 
 
 
 
7. Chinese and Japanese proper nouns, which are 
very numerous, are difficult to detect without a 
lexicon.  
8. Automatic recognition of terms and their vari-
ants (Jacquemin 2001). 
 
The various attempts to tackle these tasks by 
statistical and algorithmic methods (Kwok 1997) 
have had only limited success. An important mo-
tivation for such methodology has been the poor 
availability and high cost of acquiring and main-
taining large-scale lexical databases.  
This paper discusses how a lexicon-driven ap-
proach exploiting large-scale lexical databases 
can offer reliable solutions to some of the princi-
pal issues, based on over a decade of experience 
in building such databases for NLP applications. 
2 Named Entity Extraction 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is useful in 
NLP applications such as question answering, 
machine translation and information extraction. 
A major difficulty in NER, and a strong motiva-
tion for using tools based on probabilistic meth-
ods, is that the compilation and maintenance of 
large entity databases is time consuming and ex-
pensive. The number of personal names and their 
variants (e.g. over a hundred ways to spell Mo-
hammed) is probably in the billions. The number 
of place names is also large, though they are rela-
tively stable compared with the names of organi-
zations and products, which change frequently. 
A small number of organizations, including 
The CJK Dictionary Institute (CJKI), maintain 
databases of millions of proper nouns, but even 
such comprehensive databases cannot be kept 
fully up-to-date as countless new names are cre-
ated daily. Various techniques have been used to 
automatically detect entities, one being the use of 
keywords or syntactic structures that co-occur 
with proper nouns, which we refer to as named 
entity contextual clues (NECC).

Table 1 shows NECCs for Japanese proper 
nouns, which when used in conjunction with en-
tity lexicons like the one shown in Table 2 below 
achieve high precision in entity recognition. Of 
course for NER there is no need for such lexi-
cons to be multilingual, though it is obviously 
essential for MT.

 Note how the lexemic pairs (?L? in the LO 
column) in Table 2 above are not merely simpli-
fied and traditional orthographic (?O?) versions 
of each other, but independent lexemes equiva-
lent to American truck and British lorry. 
 
NER, especially of personal names and place 
names, is an area in which lexicon-driven meth-
ods have a clear advantage over probabilistic 
methods and in which the role of lexical re-
sources should be a central one. 
3 Linguistic Issues in Chinese 
3.1 Processing Multiword Units  
 A major issue for Chinese segmentors is how to 
treat compound words and multiword lexical 
units (MWU), which are often decomposed into 
their components rather than treated as single 
units. For example, ???  l?xi?ngd?i 'video 
cassette' and ???? j?qif?ny? 'machine trans-
lation' are not tagged as segments in Chinese 
Gigaword, the largest tagged Chinese corpus in 
existence, processed by the CKIP morphological 
analyzer (Ma 2003). Possible reasons for this 
include: 
1. The lexicons used by Chinese segmentors are 
small-scale or incomplete. Our testing of vari-
ous Chinese segmentors has shown that cover-
age of MWUs is often limited. 
2. Chinese linguists disagree on the concept of 
wordhood in Chinese. Various theories such as 
the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis (Huang 1984) 
have been proposed. Packard?s outstanding 
book (Packard 98) on the subject clears up 
much of the confusion. 
3. The "correct? segmentation can depend on the 
application, and there are various segmenta-
tion standards. For example, a search engine 
user looking for ??? is not normally inter-
ested in ?? 'to videotape' and ? 'belt' per se, 
unless they are part of ???. 
 
This last point is important enough to merit 
elaboration. A user searching for ? ? ? 
zh?nggu?r?n 'Chinese (person)' is not interested 
in ?? 'China', and vice-versa. A search for ?
? should not retrieve ??? as an instance of 
??. Exactly the same logic should apply to ?
???, so that a search for that keyword should 
only retrieve documents containing that string in 
its entirety. Yet performing a Google search on 
???? in normal mode gave some 2.3 mil-
lion hits, hundreds of thousands of which had 
zero occurrences of ???? but numerous 
65
  
 
occurrences of unrelated words like ??? 'ro-
bot', which the user is not interested in. 
 This is equivalent to saying that headwaiter 
should not be considered an instance of waiter, 
which is indeed how Google behaves. More to 
the point, English space-delimited lexemes like 
high school are not instances of the adjective 
high. As shown in Halpern (2000b), "the degree 
of solidity often has nothing to do with the status 
of a string as a lexeme. School bus is just as le-
gitimate a lexeme as is headwaiter or word-
processor. The presence or absence of spaces or 
hyphens, that is, the orthography, does not de-
termine the lexemic status of a string." 
 In a similar manner, it is perfectly legitimate 
to consider Chinese MWUs like those shown 
below as indivisible units for most applications, 
especially information retrieval and machine 
translation. 
 
???? s?ch?uzh?l? silk road 
???? j?qif?ny? machine translation 
???? ?igu?zh?y? patriotism 
??? l?xi?ngd?i video cassette 
??? X?nx?l?n New Zealand 
???? l?nzh?nm?qi?ng  
start to prepare at the last moment 
 
One could argue that ???? is composi-
tional and therefore should be considered "two 
words." Whether we count it as one or two 
"words" is not really relevant ? what matters is 
that it is one lexeme (smallest distinctive units 
associating meaning with form). On the other 
extreme, it is clear that idiomatic expressions 
like ????, literally "sharpen one's spear be-
fore going to battle," meaning 'start to prepare at 
the last moment,? are indivisible units.  
Predicting compositionality is not trivial and 
often impossible. For many purposes, the only 
practical solution is to consider all lexemes as 
indivisible. Nonetheless, currently even the most 
advanced segmentors fail to identify such lex-
emes and missegment them into their constitu-
ents, no doubt because they are not registered in 
the lexicon. This is an area in which expanded 
lexical resources can significantly improve seg-
mentation accuracy. 
In conclusion, lexical items like ???? 
'machine translation' represent stand-alone, well-
defined concepts and should be treated as single 
units. The fact that in English machineless is 
spelled solid and machine translation is not is an 
historical accident of orthography unrelated to 
the fundamental fact that both are full-fledged 
lexemes each of which represents an indivisible, 
independent concept. The same logic applies to 
????,which is a full-fledged lexeme that 
should not be decomposed. 
3.2 Multilevel Segmentation  
Chinese MWUs can consist of nested compo-
nents that can be segmented in different ways 
for different levels to satisfy the requirements of 
different segmentation standards. The example 
below shows how ???????  B?ij?ng 
R?b?nr?n Xu?xi?o 'Beijing School for Japanese 
(nationals)' can be segmented on five different 
levels. 
 
1. ??????? multiword lexemic 
2. ??+???+?? lexemic 
3. ??+??+?+?? sublexemic 
4. ?? + [?? + ?] [?+?] morphemic 
5. [?+?] [?+?+?] [?+?] submorphemic 
 
For some applications, such as MT and NER, 
the multiword lexemic level is most appropriate 
(the level most commonly used in CJKI?s dic-
tionaries). For others, such as embedded speech 
technology where dictionary size matters, the 
lexemic level is best. A more advanced and ex-
pensive solution is to store presegmented 
MWUs in the lexicon, or even to store nesting 
delimiters as shown above, making it possible to 
select the desired segmentation level. 
The problem of incorrect segmentation is es-
pecially obvious in the case of neologisms. Of 
course no lexical database can expect to keep up 
with the latest neologisms, and even the first 
edition of Chinese Gigaword does not yet have 
??  b?k? 'blog'. Here are some examples of 
MWU neologisms, some of which are not (at 
least bilingually), compositional but fully qual-
ify as lexemes. 
??? di?nn?om? cyberphile 
???? di?nz?sh?ngw? e-commerce 
??? zhu?ch?z? auto fan 
3.3 Chinese-to-Chinese Conversion (C2C) 
Numerous Chinese characters underwent drastic 
simplifications in the postwar period. Chinese 
written in these simplified forms is called Sim-
plified Chinese (SC). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
most overseas Chinese continue to use the old, 
complex forms, referred to as Traditional Chi-
nese (TC). Contrary to popular perception, the 
66
  
 
process of accurately converting SC to/from TC 
is full of complexities and pitfalls. The linguistic 
issues are discussed in Halpern and Kerman 
(1999), while technical issues are described in 
Lunde (1999). The conversion can be imple-
mented on three levels in increasing order of 
sophistication: 
 
1. Code Conversion. The easiest, but most un-
reliable, way to perform C2C is to transcode by 
using a one-to-one mapping table. Because of 
the numerous one-to-many ambiguities, as 
shown below, the rate of conversion failure is 
unacceptably high. 
Table 3. Code Conversion 
SC TC1 TC2 TC3 TC4 Remarks 
? ?    one-to-one 
? ?    one-to-one 
? ? ?   one-to-many
? ? ?   one-to-many
? ? ? ? ? one-to-many
 
2. Orthographic Conversion. The next level of 
sophistication is to convert orthographic units, 
rather than codepoints. That is,  meaningful lin-
guistic units, equivalent to lexemes, with the 
important difference that the TC is the tradi-
tional version of the SC on a character form 
level. While code conversion is ambiguous, or-
thographic conversion gives much better results 
because the orthographic mapping tables enable 
conversion on the lexeme level, as shown below. 
Table 4. Orthographic Conversion 
English SC TC1 TC2 Incorrect 
Telephone ?? ??     
Dry ?? ??   ??  ??  ?? 
  ?? ?? ??   
 
As can be seen, the ambiguities inherent in 
code conversion are resolved by using ortho-
graphic mapping tables, which avoids false con-
versions such as shown in the Incorrect column. 
Because of segmentation ambiguities, such con-
version must be done with a segmentor that can 
break the text stream into meaningful units (Em-
erson 2000). 
An extra complication, among various others, 
is that some lexemes have one-to-many ortho-
graphic mappings, all of which are correct. For 
example, SC ?? correctly maps to both TC ?
? 'dry in the shade' and TC ?? 'the five even 
numbers'. Well designed orthographic mapping 
tables must take such anomalies into account. 
3. Lexemic Conversion. The most sophisti-
cated form of C2C conversion is called lexemic 
conversion, which maps SC and TC lexemes 
that are semantically, not orthographically, 
equivalent. For example, SC ?? x?nx? 'infor-
mation' is converted into the semantically 
equivalent TC ?? z?x?n. This is similar to the 
difference between British pavement and 
American sidewalk. Tsou (2000) has demon-
strated that there are numerous lexemic differ-
ences between SC and TC, especially in techni-
cal terms and proper nouns, e.g. there are more 
than 10 variants for Osama bin Laden.

3.4 Traditional Chinese Variants 
Traditional Chinese has numerous variant char-
acter forms, leading to much confusion. Disam-
biguating these variants can be done by using 
mapping tables such as the one shown below. If 
such a table is carefully constructed by limiting 
it to cases of 100% semantic interchangeability 
for polysemes, it is easy to normalize a TC text 
by trivially replacing variants by their standard-
ized forms. For this to work, all relevant compo-
nents, such as MT dictionaries, search engine 
indexes and the related documents should be 
normalized. An extra complication is that Tai-
wanese and Hong Kong variants are sometimes 
different (Tsou 2000).

4 Orthographic Variation in Japanese  
4.1 Highly Irregular Orthography 
The Japanese orthography is highly irregular, 
significantly more so than any other major lan-
guage, including Chinese. A major factor is the 
complex interaction of the four scripts used to 
write Japanese, e.g. kanji, hiragana, katakana, 
and the Latin alphabet, resulting in countless 
words that can be written in a variety of often 
unpredictable ways, and the lack of a standard-
ized orthography. For example, toriatsukai 'han-
dling' can be written in six ways: ????, ?
??, ??, ????, ??????, ??
????. 
 
An example of how difficult Japanese IR can 
be is the proverbial 'A hen that lays golden eggs.' 
The "standard" orthography would be ????
??? Kin no tamago o umu niwatori. In real-
ity, tamago 'egg' has four variants (?, ??, ?
??, ???), niwatori 'chicken' three (?, ?
???, ????) and umu 'to lay' two (??, 
??), which expands to 24 permutations like ?
?????????, ???????? etc. 
As can be easily verified by searching the web, 
these variants occur frequently. 
 
Linguistic tools that perform segmentation, 
MT, entity extraction and the like must identify 
and/or normalize such variants to perform dic-
tionary lookup. Below is a brief discussion of 
what kind of variation occurs and how such 
normalization can be achieved. 
4.2 Okurigana Variants 
One of the most common types of orthographic 
variation in Japanese occurs in kana endings, 
called okurigana, that are attached to a kanji 
stem. For example, okonau 'perform' can be 
written ?? or ???, whereas toriatsukai can 
be written in the six ways shown above. Okuri-
gana variants are numerous and unpredictable. 
Identifying them must play a major role in Japa-
nese orthographic normalization. Although it is 
possible to create a dictionary of okurigana vari-
ants algorithmically, the resulting lexicon would 
be huge and may create numerous false positives 
not semantically interchangeable. The most ef-
fective solution is to use a lexicon of okurigana 
variants, such as the one shown below: 
 
 
Table 7. Okurigana Variants 
HEADWORD READING NORMALIZED 
???? ?????? ???? 
????? ?????? ???? 
??? ??????  ???? 
???? ?????? ???? 
 
Since Japanese is highly agglutinative and 
verbs can have numerous inflected forms, a lexi-
con such as the above must be used in conjunc-
tion with a morphological analyzer that can do 
accurate stemming, i.e. be capable of recogniz-
ing that ?????????? is the polite 
form of the canonical form ????. 
4.3 Cross-Script Orthographic Variation 
Variation across the four scripts in Japanese is 
common and unpredictable, so that the same 
word can be written in any of several scripts, or 
even as a hybrid of multiple scripts, as shown 
below: 
 
Table 8. Cross-Script Variation 
Kanji Hiragana katakana Latin Hybrid Gloss
?? ???? ????   carrot
  ???? OPEN  open
??  ???   sulfur
  ?????  Y???  shirt 
??  ??  ??  skin
 
Cross-script variation can have major conse-
quences for recall, as can be seen from the table 
below. 
 
Table 9: Hit Distribution for ?? 'carrot' ninjin 
ID Keyword Normal-
ized 
Google 
Hits 
A  ?? ?? 67,500
B  ???? ?? 66,200
C  ???? ?? 58,000
 
Using the ID above to represent the number of 
Google hits, this gives a total of A?B?C??123  
= 191,700.  ? is a coincidental occurrence factor, 
such as in  '100???, in which '??' is unre-
lated to the 'carrot' sense. The formulae for cal-
culating the above are as follows.

?? 'carrot' illustrates how serious a problem 
cross-orthographic variants can be. If ortho-
graphic normalization is not implemented to en-
sure that all variants are indexed on a standard-
ized form like ??, recall is only 30%; if it is, 
there is a dramatic improvement and recall goes 
up to nearly 100%, without any loss in precision, 
which hovers at 100%. 
4.4  Kana Variants 
A sharp increase in the use of katakana in re-
cent years is a major annoyance to NLP applica-
tions because katakana orthography is often ir-
regular; it is quite common for the same word to 
be written in multiple, unpredictable ways. Al-
though hiragana orthography is generally regular, 
a small number of irregularities persist. Some of 
the major types of kana variation are shown in 
the table below. 
 
Table 10. Kana Variants 
Type English Standard Variants 
Macron computer ?????? ???????
Long vowels maid ??? ??? 
Multiple kana team ??? ????

The above is only a brief introduction to the 
most important types of kana variation. Though 
attempts at algorithmic solutions have been 
made by some NLP research laboratories (Brill 
2001), the most practical solution is to use a ka-
takana normalization table, such as the one 
shown below, as is being done by Yahoo! Japan 
and other major portals. 
 
Table 11. Kana Variants 
HEADWORD NORMALIZED English 
??????? ???????? Architecture

???????? ???????? Architecture
4.5 Miscellaneous Variants 
There are various other types of orthographic 
variants in Japanese, described in Halpern 
(2000a). To mention some, kanji even in con-
temporary Japanese sometimes have variants, 
such as ? for ? and ? for ?, and traditional 
forms such as ? for ?. In addition, many kun 
homophones and their variable orthography are 
often close or even identical in meaning, i.e., 
noboru means 'go up' when written ??  but 
'climb' when written ?? , so that great care 
must be taken in the normalization process so as 
to assure semantic interchangeability for all 
senses of polysemes; that is, to ensure that such 
forms are excluded from the normalization table. 
4.6  Lexicon-driven Normalization  
Leaving statistical methods aside, lexicon- 
driven normalization of Japanese orthographic 
variants can be achieved by using an ortho-
graphic mapping table such as the one shown 
below, using various techniques such as: 
 
1. Convert variants to a standardized form for 
indexing. 
2. Normalize queries for dictionary lookup. 
3. Normalize all source documents. 
4. Identify forms as members of a variant group.

Other possibilities for normalization include 
advanced applications such as domain-specific 
synonym expansion, requiring Japanese thesauri 
based on domain ontologies, as is done by a se-
lect number of companies like Wand and Con-
vera who build sophisticated Japanese IR sys-
tems. 
5 Orthographic Variation in Korean 
Modern Korean has is a significant amount of 
orthographic variation, though far less than in 
Japanese. Combined with the morphological 
complexity of the language, this poses various 
challenges to developers of NLP tools. The is-
sues are similar to Japanese in principle but dif-
fer in detail. 
Briefly, Korean has variant hangul spellings 
in the writing of loanwords, such as ??? 
keikeu and ?? keik for 'cake', and in the writ-
ing of non-Korean personal names, such as 
??? keulrinteon and ??? keulrinton for 
'Clinton'. In addition, similar to Japanese but on 
a smaller scale, Korean is written in a mixture of 
hangul, Chinese characters and the Latin alpha-
bet. For example, 'shirt' can be written ???? 
wai-syeacheu or Y?? wai-syeacheu, whereas 
'one o'clock' hanzi can written as ??, 1? or 
??. Another issue is the differences between 
South and North Korea spellings, such as N.K. 
??? osakka vs. S.K. ??? osaka for 
'Osaka', and the old (pre-1988) orthography ver-
sus the new, i.e. modern ?? 'worker' (ilgun) 
used to be written ?? (ilkkun). 
Lexical databases, such as normalization ta-
bles similar to the ones shown above for Japa-
nese, are the only practical solution to identify-
ing such variants, as they are in principle unpre-
dictable. 
6 The Role of Lexical Databases 
Because of the irregular orthography of CJK 
languages, procedures such as orthographic 
normalization cannot be based on statistical and 
probabilistic methods (e.g. bigramming) alone, 
not to speak of pure algorithmic methods. Many 
attempts have been made along these lines, as 
for example Brill (2001) and Goto et al (2001), 
with some claiming performance equivalent to 
lexicon-driven methods, while Kwok (1997) 
reports good results with only a small lexicon 
and simple segmentor.  
Emerson (2000) and others have reported that 
a robust morphological analyzer capable of 
processing lexemes, rather than bigrams or n-
grams, must be supported by a large-scale com-
putational lexicon. This experience is shared by 
many of the world's major portals and MT de-
velopers, who make extensive use of lexical da-
tabases.   
Unlike in the past, disk storage is no longer a 
major issue. Many researchers and developers, 
such as Prof. Franz Guenthner of the University 
of Munich, have come to realize that ?language 
is in the data,? and ?the data is in the diction-
ary,? even to the point of compiling full-form 
dictionaries with millions of entries rather than 
rely on statistical methods, such as Meaningful 
Machines who use a full form dictionary con-
taining millions of entries in developing a hu-
man quality Spanish-to-English MT system. 
CJKI, which specializes in CJK and Arabic 
computational lexicography, is engaged in an 
ongoing research and development effort to 
compile CJK and Arabic lexical databases (cur-
rently about seven million entries), with special 
emphasis on proper nouns, orthographic nor-
malization, and C2C. These resources are being 
subjected to heavy industrial use under real-
world conditions, and the feedback thereof is 
being used to further expand these databases and 
to enhance the effectiveness of the NLP tools 
based on them. 
7 Conclusions 
Performing such tasks as orthographic normali-
zation and named entity extraction accurately is 
beyond the ability of statistical methods alone, 
not to speak of C2C conversion and morpho-
logical analysis. However, the small-scale lexi-
cal resources currently used by many NLP tools 
are inadequate to these tasks. Because of the ir-
regular orthography of the CJK writing systems, 
lexical databases fine-tuned to the needs of NLP 
applications are required. The building of 
large-scale lexicons based on corpora consisting 
of even billions of words has come of age. Since 
lexicon-driven techniques have proven their ef-
fectiveness, there is no need to overly rely on 
probabilistic methods. Comprehensive, up-to-
date lexical resources are the key to achieving 
major enhancements in NLP technology.
