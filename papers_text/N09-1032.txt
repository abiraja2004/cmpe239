Abstract
Domain adaptation is an important problem in
named entity recognition (NER). NER classi-
fiers usually lose accuracy in the domain trans-
fer due to the different data distribution be-
tween the source and the target domains. The
major reason for performance degrading is
that each entity type often has lots of domain-
specific term representations in the different
domains. The existing approaches usually
need an amount of labeled target domain data
for tuning the original model. However, it
is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task
to build annotated training data set for every
target domain. We present a domain adapta-
tion method with latent semantic association
(LaSA). This method effectively overcomes
the data distribution difference without lever-
aging any labeled target domain data. LaSA
model is constructed to capture latent seman-
tic association among words from the unla-
beled corpus. It groups words into a set of
concepts according to the related context snip-
pets. In the domain transfer, the original term
spaces of both domains are projected to a con-
cept space using LaSA model at first, then the
original NER model is tuned based on the se-
mantic association features. Experimental re-
sults on English and Chinese corpus show that
LaSA-based domain adaptation significantly
enhances the performance of NER.
1 Introduction
Named entities (NE) are phrases that contain names
of persons, organizations, locations, etc. NER is an
important task in information extraction and natu-
ral language processing (NLP) applications. Super-
vised learning methods can effectively solve NER
problem by learning a model from manually labeled
data (Borthwick, 1999; Sang and Meulder, 2003;
Gao et al, 2005; Florian et al, 2003). However, em-
pirical study shows that NE types have different dis-
tribution across domains (Guo et al, 2006). Trained
NER classifiers in the source domain usually lose
accuracy in a new target domain when the data dis-
tribution is different between both domains.
Domain adaptation is a challenge for NER and
other NLP applications. In the domain transfer,
the reason for accuracy loss is that each NE type
often has various specific term representations and
context clues in the different domains. For ex-
ample, {?economist?, ?singer?, ?dancer?, ?athlete?,
?player?, ?philosopher?, ...} are used as context
clues for NER. However, the distribution of these
representations are varied with domains. We expect
to do better domain adaptation for NER by exploit-
ing latent semantic association among words from
different domains. Some approaches have been pro-
posed to group words into ?topics? to capture im-
portant relationships between words, such as Latent
Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al, 1990),
probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hof-
mann, 1999), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
(Blei et al, 2003). These models have been success-
fully employed in topic modeling, dimensionality
reduction for text categorization (Blei et al, 2003),
ad hoc IR (Wei and Croft., 2006), and so on.
In this paper, we present a domain adaptation
method with latent semantic association. We focus
281
on capturing the hidden semantic association among
words in the domain adaptation. We introduce the
LaSA model to overcome the distribution difference
between the source domain and the target domain.
LaSA model is constructed from the unlabeled cor-
pus at first. It learns latent semantic association
among words from their related context snippets.
In the domain transfer, words in the corpus are as-
sociated with a low-dimension concept space using
LaSA model, then the original NER model is tuned
using these generated semantic association features.
The intuition behind our method is that words in one
concept set will have similar semantic features or
latent semantic association, and share syntactic and
semantic context in the corpus. They can be consid-
ered as behaving in the same way for discriminative
learning in the source and target domains. The pro-
posed method associates words from different do-
mains on a semantic level rather than by lexical oc-
currence. It can better bridge the domain distribu-
tion gap without any labeled target domain samples.
Experimental results on English and Chinese corpus
show that LaSA-based adaptation significantly en-
hances NER performance across domains.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 briefly describes the related works. Section 3
presents a domain adaptation method based on latent
semantic association. Section 4 illustrates how to
learn LaSA model from the unlabeled corpus. Sec-
tion 5 shows experimental results on large-scale En-
glish and Chinese corpus across domains, respec-
tively. The conclusion is given in Section 6.
2 Related Works
Some domain adaptation techniques have been em-
ployed in NLP in recent years. Some of them
focus on quantifying the generalizability of cer-
tain features across domains. Roark and Bacchiani
(2003) use maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation
to combine training data from the source and target
domains. Chelba and Acero (2004) use the param-
eters of the source domain maximum entropy clas-
sifier as the means of a Gaussian prior when train-
ing a new model on the target data. Daume III and
Marcu (2006) use an empirical Bayes model to esti-
mate a latent variable model grouping instances into
domain-specific or common across both domains.
Daume III (2007) further augments the feature space
on the instances of both domains. Jiang and Zhai
(2006) exploit the domain structure contained in the
training examples to avoid over-fitting the training
domains. Arnold et al (2008) exploit feature hier-
archy for transfer learning in NER. Instance weight-
ing (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and active learning (Chan
and Ng, 2007) are also employed in domain adap-
tation. Most of these approaches need the labeled
target domain samples for the model estimation in
the domain transfer. Obviously, they require much
efforts for labeling the target domain samples.
Some approaches exploit the common structure of
related problems. Ando et al (2005) learn pred-
icative structures from multiple tasks and unlabeled
data. Blitzer et al (2006, 2007) employ structural
corresponding learning (SCL) to infer a good fea-
ture representation from unlabeled source and target
data sets in the domain transfer. We present LaSA
model to overcome the data gap across domains by
capturing latent semantic association among words
from unlabeled source and target data.
In addition, Miller et al (2004) and Freitag
(2004) employ distributional and hierarchical clus-
tering methods to improve the performance of NER
within a single domain. Li and McCallum (2005)
present a semi-supervised sequence modeling with
syntactic topic models. In this paper, we focus on
capturing hidden semantic association among words
in the domain adaptation.
3 Domain Adaptation Based on Latent
Semantic Association
The challenge in domain adaptation is how to cap-
ture latent semantic association from the source and
target domain data. We present a LaSA-based do-
main adaptation method in this section.
NER can be considered as a classification prob-
lem. Let X be a feature space to represent the ob-
served word instances, and let Y be the set of class
labels. Let ps(x, y) and pt(x, y) be the true under-
lying distributions for the source and the target do-
mains, respectively. In order to minimize the efforts
required in the domain transfer, we often expect to
use ps(x, y) to approximate pt(x, y).
However, data distribution are often varied with
the domains. For example, in the economics-to-
282
entertainment domain transfer, although many NE
triggers (e.g. ?company? and ?Mr.?) are used in
both domains, some are totally new, like ?dancer?,
?singer?. Moreover, many useful words (e.g.
?economist?) in the economics NER are useless in
the entertainment domain. The above examples
show that features could change behavior across do-
mains. Some useful predictive features from one do-
main are not predictive or do not appear in another
domain. Although some triggers (e.g. ?singer?,
?economist?) are completely distinct for each do-
main, they often appear in the similar syntactic and
semantic context. For example, triggers of per-
son entity often appear as the subject of ?visited?,
?said?, etc, or are modified by ?excellent?, ?popu-
lar?, ?famous? etc. Such latent semantic association
among words provides useful hints for overcoming
the data distribution gap of both domains.
Hence, we present a LaSA model ?s,t to cap-
ture latent semantic association among words in the
domain adaptation. ?s,t is learned from the unla-
beled source and target domain data. Each instance
is characterized by its co-occurred context distribu-
tion in the learning. Semantic association feature
in ?s,t is a hidden random variable that is inferred
from data. In the domain adaptation, we transfer the
problem of semantic association mapping to a pos-
terior inference task using LaSA model. Latent se-
mantic concept association set of a word instance x
(denoted by SA(x)) is generated by ?s,t. Instances
in the same concept set are considered as behaving
in the same way for discriminative learning in both
domains. Even though word instances do not ap-
pear in a training corpus (or appear rarely) but are in
similar context, they still might have relatively high
probability in the same semantic concept set. Obvi-
ously, SA(x) can better bridge the gap between the
two distributions ps(y|x) and pt(y|x). Hence, LaSA
model can enhance the estimate of the source do-
main distribution ps(y|x; ?s,t) to better approximate
the target domain distribution pt(y|x; ?s,t).
4 Learning LaSA Model from Virtual
Context Documents
In the domain adaptation, LaSA model is employed
to find the latent semantic association structures of
?words? in a text corpus. We will illustrate how
to build LaSA model from words and their context
snippets in this section. LaSA model actually can
be considered as a general probabilistic topic model.
It can be learned on the unlabeled corpus using the
popular hidden topic models such as LDA or pLSI.
4.1 Virtual Context Document
The distribution of content words (e.g. nouns, adjec-
tives) is usually varied with domains. Hence, in the
domain adaptation, we focus on capturing the latent
semantic association among content words. In or-
der to learn latent relationships among words from
the unlabeled corpus, each content word is charac-
terized by a virtual context document as follows.
Given a content word xi, the virtual context docu-
ment of xi (denoted by vdxi) consists of all the con-
text units around xi in the corpus. Let n be the total
number of the sentences which contain xi in the cor-
pus. vdxi is constructed as follows.
vdxi = {F (xs1i ), ..., F (xski ), ..., F (xsni )}
where, F (xski ) denotes the context feature set of
xi in the sentence sk, 1 ? k ? n.
Given the context window size {-t, t} (i.e. pre-
vious t words and next t words around xi in sk).
F (xski ) usually consists of the following features.
1. Anchor unit AxiC : the current focused word unit xi.
2. Left adjacent unit AxiL : The nearest left adjacent
unit xi?1 around xi, denoted by AL(xi?1).
3. Right adjacent unit AxiR : The nearest right adjacent
unit xi+1 around xi, denoted by AR(xi+1).
4. Left context set CxiL : the other left adjacent units
{xi?t, ..., xi?j , ..., xi?2} (2 ? j ? t) around xi, de-
noted by {CL(xi?t), ..., CL(xi?j), ..., CL(xi?2)}.
5. Right context set CxiR : the other right adjacent units
{xi+2, ..., xi+j , ..., xi+t} (2 ? j ? t ) around xi, de-
noted by {CR(xi+2), ..., CR(xi+j), ..., CR(xi+t)}.
For example, given xi=?singer?, sk=?This popu-
lar new singer attended the new year party?. Let
the context window size be {-3,3}. F (singer)
= {singer, AL(new), AR(attend(ed)), CL(this),
CL(popular), CR(the), CR(new) }.
vdxi actually describes the semantic and syntac-
tic feature distribution of xi in the domains. We
construct the feature vector of xi with all the ob-
served context features in vdxi . Given vdxi =
283
{f1, ..., fj , ..., fm}, fj denotes jth context feature
around xi, 1 ? j ? m, m denotes the total num-
ber of features in vdxi . The value of fj is calculated
by Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990)
between xi and fj .
Weight(fj , xi) = log2 P (fj , xi)P (fj)P (xi) (1)
where, P (fj , xi) is the joint probability of xi and
fj co-occurred in the corpus, P (fj) is the probabil-
ity of fj occurred in the corpus. P (xi) is the proba-
bility of xi occurred in the corpus.
4.2 Learning LaSA Model
Topic models are statistical models of text that posit
a hidden space of topics in which the corpus is em-
bedded (Blei et al, 2003). LDA (Blei et al, 2003) is
a probabilistic model that can be used to model and
discover underlying topic structures of documents.
LDA assumes that there are K ?topics?, multinomial
distributions over words, which describes a collec-
tion. Each document exhibits multiple topics, and
each word in each document is associated with one
of them. LDA imposes a Dirichlet distribution on
the topic mixture weights corresponding to the doc-
uments in the corpus. The topics derived by LDA
seem to possess semantic coherence. Those words
with similar semantics are likely to occur in the same
topic. Since the number of LDA model parameters
depends only on the number of topic mixtures and
vocabulary size, LDA is less prone to over-fitting
and is capable of estimating the probability of un-
observed test documents. LDA is already success-
fully applied to enhance document representations
in text classification (Blei et al, 2003), information
retrieval (Wei and Croft., 2006).
In the following, we illustrate how to construct
LDA-style LaSA model ?s,t on the virtual con-
text documents. Algorithm 1 describes LaSA
model training method in detail, where, Function
AddTo(data, Set) denotes that data is added to
Set. Given a large-scale unlabeled data set Du
which consists of the source and target domain data,
virtual context document for each candidate content
word is extracted from Du at first, then the value of
each feature in a virtual context document is calcu-
lated using its Mutual Information ( see Equation 1
in Section 4.1) instead of the counts when running

generated on the virtual context document set V Ds,t
using the algorithm presented by Blei et al(2003).

Table 1: Top 10 nouns from 5 randomly selected topics
computed on the economics and entertainment domains
LaSA model learns the posterior distribution to
decompose words and their corresponding virtual
context documents into topics. Table 1 lists top 10
nouns from a random selection of 5 topics computed
on the unlabeled economics and entertainment do-
main data. As shown, words in the same topic are
representative nouns. They actually are grouped into
broad concept sets. For example, set 1, 3 and 4
correspond to nominal person, nominal organization
and location, respectively. With a large-scale unla-
beled corpus, we will have enough words assigned
to each topic concept to better approximate the un-
derlying semantic association distribution.
In LDA-style LaSA model, the topic mixture
is drawn from a conjugate Dirichlet prior that re-
mains the same for all the virtual context docu-
284
ments. Hence, given a word xi in the corpus, we
may perform posterior inference to determine the
conditional distribution of the hidden topic feature
variables associated with xi. Latent semantic asso-
ciation set of xi (denoted by SA(xi)) is generated
using Algorithm 2. Here, Multinomial(?s,t(vdxi))
refers to sample from the posterior distribution over
topics given a virtual document vdxi . In the domain
adaptation, we do semantic association inference on
the source domain training data using LaSA model
at first, then the original source domain NER model
is tuned on the source domain training data set by
incorporating these generated semantic association
features.

sociation Set of Word xi Using K-topic

end16
LaSA model better models latent semantic asso-
ciation distribution in the source and the target do-
mains. By grouping words into concepts, we effec-
tively overcome the data distribution difference of
both domains. Thus, we may reduce the number
of parameters required to model the target domain
data, and improve the quality of the estimated pa-
rameters in the domain transfer. LaSA model ex-
tends the traditional bag-of-words topic models to
context-dependence concept association model. It
has potential use for concept grouping.
5 Experiments
We evaluate LaSA-based domain adaptation method
on both English and Chinese corpus in this section.
In the experiments, we focus on recognizing person
(PER), location (LOC) and organization (ORG) in
the given four domains, including economics (Eco),
entertainment (Ent), politics (Pol) and sports (Spo).
5.1 Experimental setting
In the NER domain adaptation, nouns and adjectives
make a significant impact on the performance. Thus,
we focus on capturing latent semantic association
for high-frequency nouns and adjectives (i.e. occur-
rence count ? 50 ) in the unlabeled corpus. LaSA
models for nouns and adjectives are learned from
the unlabeled corpus using Algorithm 1 (see section
4.2), respectively. Our empirical study shows that
better adaptation is obtained with a 50-topic LaSA
model. Therefore, we set the number of topics N as
50, and define the context view window size as {-
3,3} (i.e. previous 3 words and next 3 words) in the
LaSA model learning. LaSA features for other irre-
spective words (e.g. token unit ?the?) are assigned
with a default topic value N+1.
All the basic NER models are trained on the
domain-specific training data using RRM classifier
(Guo et al, 2005). RRM is a generalization Winnow
learning algorithm (Zhang et al, 2002). We set the
context view window size as {-2,2} in NER. Given a
word instance x, we employ local linguistic features
(e.g. word unit, part of speech) of x and its context
units ( i.e. previous 2 words and next 2 words ) in
NER. All Chinese texts in the experiments are auto-
matically segmented into words using HMM.
In LaSA-based domain adaptation, the semantic
association features of each unit in the observation
window {-2,2} are generated by LaSA model at first,
then the basic source domain NER model is tuned on
the original source domain training data set by incor-
porating the semantic association features. For ex-
ample, given the sentence ?This popular new singer
attended the new year party?, Figure 1 illustrates
various features and views at the current word wi=
?singer? in LaSA-based adaptation.

Figure 1: Feature window in LaSA-based adaptation
In the viewing window at the word ?singer? (see
Figure 1), each word unit around ?singer? is codi-
fied with a set of primitive features (e.g. POS, SA,
Tag), together with its relative position to ?singer?.
285
Here, ?SA? denotes semantic association feature set
which is generated by LaSA model. ?Tag? denotes
NE tags labeled in the data set.
Given the input vector constructed with the above
features, RRM method is then applied to train linear
weight vectors, one for each possible class-label. In
the decoding stage, the class with the maximum con-
fidence is then selected for each token unit.
In our evaluation, only NEs with correct bound-
aries and correct class labels are considered as the
correct recognition. We use the standard Precision
(P), Recall (R), and F-measure (F = 2PRP+R ) to mea-
sure the performance of NER models.
5.2 Data
We built large-scale English and Chinese anno-
tated corpus. English corpus are generated from
wikipedia while Chinese corpus are selected from
Chinese newspapers. Moreover, test data do not
overlap with training data and unlabeled data.
5.2.1 Generate English Annotated Corpus
from Wikipedia
Wikipedia provides a variety of data resources for
NER and other NLP research (Richman and Schone,
2008). We generate all the annotated English corpus
from wikipedia. With the limitation of efforts, only
PER NEs in the corpus are automatically tagged us-
ing an English person gazetteer. We automatically
extract an English Person gazetteer from wikipedia
at first. Then we select the articles from wikipedia
and tag them using this gazetteer.
In order to build the English Person gazetteer
from wikipdedia, we manually selected several key
phrases, including ?births?, ?deaths?, ?surname?,
?given names? and ?human names? at first. For
each article title of interest, we extracted the cate-
gories to which that entry was assigned. The en-
try is considered as a person name if its related
explicit category links contain any one of the key
phrases, such as ?Category: human names?. We to-
tally extracted 25,219 person name candidates from
204,882 wikipedia articles. And we expanded this
gazetteer by adding the other available common
person names. Finally, we obtained a large-scale
gazetteer of 51,253 person names.
All the articles selected from wikipedia are further
tagged using the above large-scale gazetteer. Since
human annotated set were not available, we held out
more than 100,000 words of text from the automat-
ically tagged corpus to as a test set in each domain.
Table 2 shows the data distribution of the training
and test data sets.

ployed to ensure the quality of the annotated corpus.

5.3.1 Performance Enhancement of NER by
LaSA-based Domain Adaptation
Table 6 and 7 show the experimental results for
all pairs of domain adaptation on both English and
Chinese corpus, respectively. In the experiment,
the basic source domain NER model Ms is learned
from the specific domain training data set Ddom
(see Table 2 and 4 in Section 5.2). Here, dom ?
{Eco,Ent, Pol, Spo}. F indom denotes the top-line
F-measure of Ms in the source trained domain dom.
When Ms is directly applied in a new target do-
main, its F-measure in this basic transfer is consid-
ered as baseline (denoted by FBase). FLaSA de-
notes F-measure of Ms achieved in the target do-
main with LaSA-based domain adaptation. ?(F ) =
FLaSA?FBase
FBase , which denotes the relative F-measure
enhancement by LaSA-based domain adaptation.

Table 6: Experimental results on English corpus
Experimental results on English and Chinese cor-
pus indicate that the performance of Ms signifi-

Table 7: Experimental results on Chinese corpus
cent points in this basic transfer. Significant perfor-
mance degrading of Ms is observed in all the basic
transfer. It shows that the data distribution of both
domains is very different in each possible transfer.
Experimental results on English corpus show that
LaSA-based adaptation effectively enhances the per-
formance in each domain transfer (see Table 6).
For example, in the ?Pol?Eco? transfer, FBase is
63.62% while FLaSA achieves 68.10%. Compared
with FBase, LaSA-based method significantly en-
hances F-measure by 7.04%. We perform t-tests on
F-measure of all the comparison experiments on En-
glish corpus. The p-value is 2.44E-06, which shows
that the improvement is statistically significant.
Table 6 also gives the accuracy loss due to transfer
in each domain adaptation on English corpus. The
accuracy loss is defined as loss = 1 ? FF indom . And
the relative reduction in error is defined as ?(loss)=
|1 ? lossLaSAlossBase |. Experimental results indicate that
the relative reduction in error is above 9.93% with
LaSA-based transfer in each test on English cor-
pus. LaSA model significantly decreases the ac-
curacy loss by 29.38% in average. Especially for
?Spo?Pol? transfer, ?(loss) achieves 63.98% with
LaSA-based adaptation. All the above results show
that LaSA-based adaptation significantly reduces the
accuracy loss in the domain transfer for English
NER without any labeled target domain samples.
Experimental results on Chinese corpus also show
that LaSA-based adaptation effectively increases the
accuracy in all the tests (see Table 7). For example,
in the ?Eco?Ent? transfer, compared with FBase,
LaSA-based adaptation significantly increases F-
measure by 9.88%. We also perform t-tests on F-
287
measure of 12 comparison experiments on Chinese
corpus. The p-value is 1.99E-06, which shows that
the enhancement is statistically significant. More-
over, the relative reduction in error is above 10%
with LaSA-based method in each test. LaSA model
decreases the accuracy loss by 16.43% in average.
Especially for the ?Eco?Ent? transfer (see Table 7),
?(loss) achieves 26.29% with LaSA-based method.
All the above experimental results on English and
Chinese corpus show that LaSA-based domain adap-
tation significantly decreases the accuracy loss in the
transfer without any labeled target domain data. Al-
though automatically tagging introduced some er-
rors in English source training data, the relative re-
duction in errors in English NER adaptation seems
comparable to that one in Chinese NER adaptation.
5.3.2 Accuracy Enhancement for Each NE
Type Recognition
Our statistic data (Guo et al, 2006) show that the
distribution of NE types varies with domains. Each
NE type has different domain features. Thus, the
performance stability of each NE type recognition is
very important in the domain transfer.
Figure 2 gives F-measure of each NE type recog-
nition achieved by LaSA-based adaptation on En-
glish and Chinese corpus. Experimental results
show that LaSA-based adaptation effectively in-
creases the accuracy of each NE type recognition in
the most of the domain transfer tests. We perform
t-tests on F-measure of the comparison experiments
on each NE type, respectively. All the p-value is
less than 0.01, which shows that the improvement
on each NE type recognition is statistically signifi-
cant. Especially, the p-value of English and Chinese
PER is 2.44E-06 and 9.43E-05, respectively, which
shows that the improvement on PER recognition is
very significant. For example, in the ?Eco?Pol?
transfer on Chinese corpus, compared with FBase,
LaSA-based adaptation enhances F-measure of PER
recognition by 9.53 percent points. Performance en-
hancement for ORG recognition is less than that one
for PER and LOC recognition using LaSA model
since ORG NEs usually contain much more domain-
specific information than PER and LOC.
The major reason for error reduction is that exter-
nal context and internal units are better semantically
associated using LaSA model. For example, LaSA
Figure 2: PER, LOC and ORG recognition in the transfer
model better groups various titles from different do-
mains (see Table 1 in Section 4.2). Various industry
terms in ORG NEs are also grouped into the seman-
tic sets. These semantic associations provide useful
hints for detecting the boundary of NEs in the new
target domain. All the above results show that LaSA
model better compensates for the feature distribution
difference of each NE type across domains.
6 Conclusion
We present a domain adaptation method with LaSA
model in this paper. LaSA model captures latent se-
mantic association among words from the unlabeled
corpus. It better groups words into a set of concepts
according to the related context snippets. LaSA-
based domain adaptation method projects words to
a low-dimension concept feature space in the trans-
fer. It effectively overcomes the data distribution gap
across domains without using any labeled target do-
main data. Experimental results on English and Chi-
nese corpus show that LaSA-based domain adapta-
tion significantly enhances the performance of NER
across domains. Especially, LaSA model effectively
increases the accuracy of each NE type recogni-
tion in the domain transfer. Moreover, LaSA-based
domain adaptation method works well across lan-
guages. To further reduce the accuracy loss, we will
explore informative sampling to capture fine-grained
data difference in the domain transfer.
