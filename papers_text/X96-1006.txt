The latest in a series of natural language 
processing system evaluations was concluded in 
October 1995 and was the topic of the Sixth 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) in 
November, co-chaired by Ralph Grishman (NYU) 
and Beth Sundheim (NRaD). Participants were 
invited to enter their systems in as many as four 
different task-oriented evaluations. The Named 
Entity and Coreference tasks entailed Standard 
Generalized Markup Language (SGML) annotation 
of texts and were being conducted for the first time. 
The other two tasks, Template Element and 
Scenario Template, were information extraction 
tasks that followed on from previous MUC 
evaluations. All except he Scenario Template task 
are defined independently of any particular domain. 
The evolution and design of the MUC-6 
evaluation are described in the conference 
proceedings \[1\]. A basic characterization of the 
challenge presented by each task is as follows: 
? Named Ent i ty  (NE) -- Insert SGML 
tags into the text to mark each string that 
represents a person, organization, or location 
name, or a date or time stamp, or a currency or 
percentage figure. 
? Coreference (CO) -- Insert SGML tags 
into the text to link strings that represent 
coreferring noun phrases. 
? Template Element (TE) -- Extract 
basic information related to organization and 
person entities, drawing evidence ffrom 
anywhere in the text. 
? Scenario Template (ST) -- Drawing 
evidence from anywhere in the text, extract 
prespecified event information, and relate the 
event information to the particular 
organization and person entities involved in 
the event. 
later, with results due by the end of the week. 
Sixteen sites participated in the evaluation; 15 
systems were evaluated for the NE task, 7 for CO, 
11 for TE, and 9 for ST. 1 
The variety of tasks that were designed for 
MUC-6 reflects the interests of both participants and 
sponsors in assessing and furthering research that 
can satisfy some urgent ext processing needs in the 
very near term and can lead to solutions to more 
challenging text understanding problems in the 
longer term. The hard work carried out by the 
planning committee over nearly two years led to 
extremely interesting and useful evaluation results. 
oIdentification of names, which constitutes a
large portion of the NE task and a critical portion of 
the TE task, has proven to be largely a solved 
problem. The majority of systems evaluated on NE 
had recall and precision over 90%; the highest- 
scoring system had a recall of 96% and a precision 
of 97%, which was judged to be comparable to 
human performance on the task. 
oRecognition of alternative ways of 
identifying an entity constitutes a large portion of 
the CO task and another critical portion of the TE 
task; it has been shown to represent only a modest 
challenge when the referents are names or pronouns. 
All but two of the TE systems posted combined 
recall-precision (F-measure) scores in the 70-80% 
range; four of the systems were able to achieve 
recall in the 70-80% range while maintaining 
precision in the 80-90% range. The top-scoring 
system had 75% recall, 86% precision. Five of the 
seven CO systems were in the 51%-63% recall 
range and 62%-72% precision range. 
Testing was conducted using Wall Street 
Journal texts provided by the Linguistic Data 
Consortium. The test set for the two information 
extraction tasks consisted of 100 articles. A subset 
of 30 articles was selected for use as the test set for 
the two SGML annotation tasks. The evaluation 
began with the distribution of the scenario 
definition and training data at the beginning of 
September. The test data was distributed four weeks

Technology, University of Durham (UK), Knight- 
Ridder Information, Lockheed-Martin, University of 
Manitoba (Canada), University of Massachusetts 
(Amherst), The MITRE Corp., New Mexico State

University, University of Pennsylvania, SAIC 
(McLean), University of Sheffield (UK), Systems 
Research and Applications, SRI International, Sterling 
Software, and Wayne State University.

oThe ST task concerned changes in corporate 
executive management personnel; the extracted 
information i cludes answers to the basic questions 
of "Who is creating or filling what vacancy at what 
organization?". The mix of challenges that the task 
represents -- extraction of domain-specific events and 
relations along with the pertinent entities (template 
elements) -- yielded levels of performance that are 
similar to those achieved in previous MUCs (40%- 
50% recall, 60%-70% precision), but with a much 
shorter time required for porting. The highest ST 
performance overall was 47% recall and 70% 
precision.
