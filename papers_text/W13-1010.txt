Abstract 
This paper presents a supervised machine 
learning approach that uses a machine learn-
ing algorithm called Random Forest for rec-
ognition of Bengali noun-noun compounds as 
multiword expression (MWE) from Bengali 
corpus. Our proposed approach to MWE rec-
ognition has two steps: (1) extraction of can-
didate multi-word expressions using Chunk 
information and various heuristic rules and (2) 
training the machine learning algorithm to 
recognize a candidate multi-word expression 
as Multi-word expression or not. A variety of 
association measures, syntactic and linguistic 
clues are used as features for identifying 
MWEs. The proposed system is tested on a 
Bengali corpus for identifying noun-noun 
compound MWEs from the corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Automatic identification of multiword expression 
(MWE) from a text document can be useful for 
many NLP (natural language processing) applica-
tions such as information retrieval, machine trans-
lation, word sense disambiguation. According to 
Frank Samadja (1993), MWEs are defined as ?re-
current combinations of words that co-occur more 
often than expected by chance?. Timothy Baldwin 
et al (2010) defined multiword expressions 
(MWEs) as lexical items that: (a) can be decom-
posed into multiple lexemes; and (b) display lexi-
cal, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical 
idiomaticity. Most real world NLP applications 
tend to ignore MWE, or handle them simply by 
listing, but successful applications will need to 
identify and treat them appropriately.  
As Jackendoff (1997) stated, the magnitude of 
this problem is far greater than has traditionally 
been realized within linguistics. He estimates that 
the number of MWEs in a native speakers?s lex-
icon is of the same order of magnitude as the num-
ber of single words. In WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum, 
1999), for example, 41% of the entries are multi-
word.  
MWEs can be broadly classified into lexicalized 
phrases and institutionalized phrases (Ivan A. sag 
et al, 2002). In terms of the semantics, composi-
tionality is an important property of MWEs. Com-
positionality is the degree to which the features of 
the parts of a MWE combine to predict the features 
of the whole. According to the compositionality 
property,  the MWEs  can take a variety of forms: 
complete compositionality (also known as institu-
tionalized phrases, e.g. many thanks, ????? ?????? 
(Rajya Sarkar, state government)), partial composi-
tionality (e.g. light house, ????? ??? (shopping mall), 
??? ????? (aam admi, common people)), idiosyn-
cratically compositionality (e.g. spill the beans (to 
reveal)) and finally complete non-compositionality 
(e.g. hot dog, green card, ?u?? ???? (ubhoy sang-
kat, on the horns of a dilemma)). 
Compound noun is a lexical unit. It is a class of 
MWE which is rapidly expanding due to the conti-
nuous addition of new terms for introducing new 
ideas. Compound nouns fall into both groups: lexi-
calized and institutionalized. A noun-noun com-
pound in English characteristically occurs 
frequently with high lexical and semantic variabili-
ty.  A summary examination of the 90 million-
64
word written component of the British National 
Corpus (BNC) uncover the fact that there are over 
400,000 NN (Noun-Noun) compound types, with a 
combined token frequency of 1.3 million, that is,  
over 1% of words in the BNC are NN compounds 
(Timothy Baldwin et al, 2003). Since compound 
nouns are rather productive and new compound 
nouns are created from day to day, it is impossible 
to exhaustively store all compound nouns in a dic-
tionary 
It is also common practice in Bengali literature 
to use compound nouns as MWEs. Bengali new 
terms directly coined from English terms are also 
commonly used as MWEs in Bengali (e.g., ???? ??? 
(dengue three), ??????? ???? (nano sim), ?????? ????????? 
(village tourism), ?a??????  ?????? (alert message)). 
The main focus of our work is to develop a ma-
chine learning approach based on a set of statistic-
al, syntactic and linguistic features for identifying 
Bengali noun-noun compounds.  
To date, not much comprehensive work has 
been done on Bengali multiword expression identi-
fication. 
Different types of compound nouns in Bengali 
are discussed in section 2. Related works are pre-
sented in section 3. The proposed noun-noun 
MWE identification method has been detailed in 
section 4. The evaluation and results are presented 
in section 5 and conclusions and feature work are 
drawn in section 6.  
2 Classification of Bengali Compound 
Nouns 
In Bengali, MWEs are quite varied and many of 
these are of types that are not encountered in Eng-
lish.   The primary types of compound nouns in 
Bengali are discussed below. 
Named-Entities (NE): Names of people (????? 
???? (Tirtha Das), ???? ???? (Nayan Roy)). Name of 
the location (?????? ?s??? (Hooghly Station), ?a???? 
?????? (Ashok Bihar)). Names of the Organization 
(??i????? ??b a??????? a???????????? (Ideal cable 
operators association), ????? i?n??? (Reebok India)). 
Here inflection can be added to the last word. 
Idiomatic Compound Nouns: These are cha-
racteristically idiomatic and unproductive. For ex-
ample, ??? ????? (maa baba, father mother), ??? 
???????? (kaal karkhana, mills and workshops) are 
MWEs of this kind. 
Idioms: These are the expressions whose mean-
ings can not be recovered from their component 
words. For example, ?????? ??? (taser ghar, any 
construction that may tumble down easily at any 
time), ?????? ????? (pakhir chokh, target), ????? ??p?? 
(sabuj biplab, green revolution) are the idioms in 
Bengali.  
Numbers: These are productive in nature and 
little inflection like syntactic variation is also seen 
in number expression. For example,  ?????? ??? ?n?? 
(soya teen ghanta, three hours and fifteen minutes), 
????i ???? (arawi guun, two and a half times), ????? 
?????? (sharre teenta, three hours and thirty 
minutes), ???? ???? (der bachar, one and a half year) 
are MWEs of this kind. 
Relational Noun Compounds: These are gen-
erally consists of two words, no word can be in-
serted in between. Some examples are:  ????????? 
??i? (pistuto bhai, cousin), ???? ????? (majo meyya, 
second daughter). 
Conventionalized Phrases (or Institutiona-
lized phrases):  
Institutionalized? phrases? are? conventionalized?
phrases,? such? as? (?????? ??????? (bibaha barshiki, 
marriage anniversary, ???k? ????? (chakka jam, 
standstill), ?????? ?????? (share bazar, share market)).?
They? are? semantically? and? syntactically? composi?
tional,?but?statistically?idiosyncratic.? 
 
Simile terms: It is analogy term in Bengali and 
semi-productive (?????? ????? (hater panch, last 
resort), ????? ???? (kather katha, a word for word?s 
sake)). 
Reduplicated terms: Reduplicated terms are 
non-productive and tagged as noun phrase. Namely 
Onomatopoeic expression (??? ??? (khhat khhat, 
knock knock), ??? ??? (hu hu, the noise made by a 
strong wind)), Complete reduplication (????? ????? 
(bari bari, door to door), ?b?? b??? (blocke blocke, 
block block)), Partial reduplication (??n? ?n?? 
(jantar mantar)), Semantic reduplication (????? ?n??? 
(matha mundu, head or tail)), Correlative redupli-
cation (?????????? (maramari, fighting)).  
Administrative terms: These are institutiona-
lized as administrative terms and are non-
productive in nature. Here inflection can be added 
with the last word (?s??? ?nt?? (sarastra montrak, 
home ministry)), ?s?s? ????? (sastha sachib, health 
secretary)). 
65
One of the component of MWE from English 
literature: Some examples of Bengali MWEs of 
this kind are ???d??? ????? ? (madrasha board), ?????? ???? 
(metro sahar, metro city). 
Both of the component of MWE from English 
literature: Some examples of Bengali MWEs of 
this kind are ??????? ???? ? (roaming charge), ??k??? ???? ? 
(credit card). 
3 Related Work 
The earliest works on Multiword expression ex-
traction can be classified as:  Association measure 
based methods, deep linguistic based methods, ma-
chine learning based methods and hybrid methods. 
Many previous works have used statistical 
measures for multiword expression extraction. One 
of the important advantages of using statistical 
measures for extracting multiword expression is 
that these measures are language independent.  
Frank Smadja (1993) developed a system, Xtract 
that uses positional distribution and part-of-speech 
information of surrounding words of a word in a 
sentence to identify interesting word pairs.  Clas-
sical statistical hypothesis test like Chi-square test, 
t-test, z-test, log-likelihood ratio (Ted Dunning, 
1993) have also been employed to extract colloca-
tions. Gerlof Bouma (2009) has presented a me-
thod for collocation extraction that uses some 
information theory based association measures 
such as mutual information and pointwise mutual 
information.  
Wen Zhang et al(2009) highlights the deficien-
cies of mutual information and suggested an en-
hanced mutual information based association 
measures to overcome the deficiencies. The major 
deficiencies of the classical mutual information, as 
they mention, are its poor capacity to measure as-
sociation of words with unsymmetrical co-
occurrence and adjustment of threshold value. 
Anoop et al(2008) also used various statistical 
measures such as point-wise mutual information 
(K. Church et al, 1990), log-likelihood, frequency 
of occurrence, closed form (e.g., blackboard) 
count, hyphenated count (e.g., black-board) for 
extraction of Hindi compound noun multiword 
extraction. Aswhini et al(2004) has used co-
occurrence and significance function to extract 
MWE automatically in Bengali, focusing mainly 
on Noun-verb MWE. Sandipan et al(2006) has 
used association measures namely salience (Adam 
Kilgarrif et al, 2000), mutual information and log 
likelihood for finding N-V collocation. Tanmoy 
(2010) has used a linear combination of some of 
the association measures namely co-occurrence, 
Phi, significance function to obtain a  linear rank-
ing function for ranking Bengali noun-noun collo-
cation candidates and MWEness is measured by 
the rank score assigned by the ranking function. 
The statistical tool (e.g., log likelihood ratio) 
may miss many commonly used MWEs that occur 
in low frequencies. To overcome this problem, 
some linguistic clues are also useful for multiword 
expression extraction. Scott Songlin Paul et al
(2005) focuses on a symbolic approach to multi-
word extraction that uses large-scale semantically 
classified multiword expression template database 
and semantic field information assigned to MWEs 
by the USAS semantic tagger (Paul Rayson et 
al.,2004 ). R. Mahesh et al(2011) has used a step-
wise methodology that exploits linguistic know-
ledge such as replicating words (ruk ruk e.g. stop 
stop), pair of words (din-raat e.g. day night), sa-
maas (N+N, A+N) and Sandhi (joining or fusion of 
words), Vaalaa morpheme (jaane vaalaa e.g. about 
to go) constructs for mining Hindi MWEs. A Rule-
Based approach for identifying only reduplication 
from Bengali corpus has been presented in Tan-
moy et al(2010). A semantic clustering based ap-
proach for indentifying bigram noun-noun MWEs 
from a medium-size Bengali corpus has been pre-
sented in Tanmoy et al(2011). The authors of this 
paper hypothesize that the more the similarity be-
tween two components in a bigram, the less the 
probability to be a MWE. The similarity between 
two components is measured based on the syn-
onymous sets of the component words. 
Pavel Pecina (2008) used linear logistic regres-
sion, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Neur-
al Networks separately on feature vector consisting 
of 55 association measures for extracting MWEs. 
M.C. Diaz-Galiano et al (2004) has applied Koho-
nen?s linear vector quantization (LVQ) to integrate 
several statistical estimators in order to recognize 
MWEs. Sriram Venkatapathy et al (2005) has pre-
sented an approach to measure relative composi-
tionality of Hindi noun-verb MWEs using 
Maximum entropy model (MaxEnt).  Kishorjit et al
(2011) has presented a conditional random field 
(CRF) based method for extraction and translitera-
tion of Manipuri MWEs. 
66
Hybrid methods combine statistical, linguistic 
and/or machine learning methods. Maynard and 
Ananiadou (2000) combined both linguistics and 
statistical information in their system, TRUCK, for 
extracting multi-word terms. Dias (2003) has de-
veloped a hybrid system for MWE extraction, 
which integrates word statistics and linguistic in-
formation. Carlos Ramisch et al (2010) presents a 
hybrid approach to multiword expression extrac-
tion that combines the strengths of different 
sources of information using a machine learning 
algorithm. Ivan A. Sag et al(2002) argued in favor 
of maintaining the right balance between symbolic 
and statistical approaches while developing a hybr-
id MWE extraction system. 
4 Proposed Noun-Noun compound Identi-
fication Method 
Our proposed noun-noun MWE identification me-
thod has several steps: preprocessing, candidate 
noun-noun MWE extraction and MWE identifica-
tion by classifying the candidates MWEs into two 
categories: positive (MWE) and negative (non-
MWE). 
4.1 Preprocessing 
At this step, unformatted documents are segmented 
into a collection of sentences automatically accord-
ing to Dari (in English, full stop), Question mark 
(?) and Exclamation sign (!). Typographic or pho-
netic errors are not corrected automatically. Then 
the sentences are submitted to the chunker 1 one by 
one for processing. The chunked output is then 
processed to delete the information which is not 
required for MWE identification task.  A Sample 
input sentence and the corresponding chunked sen-
tence after processing are shown in figure 1.

4.2 Candidate Noun-Noun MWE Extraction 
The chunked sentences are processed to identify 
the noun-noun multi-word expression candidates. 
The multiword expression candidates are primarily 
extracted using the following rule: 
Bigram consecutive noun-noun token sequence 
within same NP chunk is extracted from the 
chunked sentences if the Tag of the token is NN or 
NNP or XC (NN: Noun, NNP: Proper Noun, XC: 
compounds) (Akshar Bharati et al, 2006).  
We observed that some potential noun-noun 
multi-word expressions are missed due to the 
chunker?s error. For example, the chunked version 
of the sentence is ((NP ?????? NN)) ((NP ??e?e NN 
)) ((NP ??i??? NN, SYM )). Here we find that the 
potential noun-noun multi-word expression candi-
date ???e?e ??i???? (BSA Cycle) cannot be detected 
using the first rule since ???e?e? (BSA) and ??i??? 
(Cycle) belong to the different chunk. 
To identify more number of potential noun-noun 
MWE candidates, we use some heuristic rules as 
follows: 
Bigram noun-noun compounds which are hy-
phenated or occur within single quote or within 
first brackets or whose words are out of vocabulary 
(OOV) are also considered as the potential candi-
dates for MWE. 
4.3 Features 
4.3.1 Statistical features: We use the association 
measures namely phi, point-wise mutual informa-
tion (pmi), salience, log likelihood, poisson stirl-
ing, chi and t-score to calculate the scores of each 
noun-noun candidate MWE. These association 
measures use various types of frequency statistics 
associated with the bigram. Since Bengali is highly 
inflectional language, the candidate noun-noun 
compounds are stemmed while computing their 
frequencies. 
The frequency statistics used in computing asso-
ciation measures are represented using a typical 
contingency table format (Satanjeev Banerjee et 
al., 2003). Table 1 shows a typical contingency 
table showing various types of frequencies asso-
ciated with the noun-noun bigram <word, word2> 
(e.g., ???? ?????). The meanings of the entries in the 
contingency table are given below: 
n11 = number of times the bigram occurs, joint fre-
quency.  
Sample input sentence:  
?????? e?? a??????? ??l ?(paribhan ekti attyabo-
shak shilpo, Communication is a essential 
industry.) 
Processed output from the chunker:  
((NP ?????? NN )) (( NP e?? QC a??????? JJ 
??l NN SYM ))
67
n12 = number of times word1 occurs in the first 
position of a bigram when word2 does not occur in 
the second position. 
 
 ????? 
(government) 
?????? 
(~ govern-
ment) 
 
???? 
(state) 
n11 n12 n1p 
????? 
(~state) 
n21 n22 n2p 
 np1 np2 npp 
 Table 1: Contingency table 
 
n21 = number of times word2 occurs in the second 
position of a bigram when word1 does not occur in 
the first position. 
n22 = number of bigrams where word1 is not in the 
first position and word2 is not in the second posi-
tion. 
n1p = the number of bigrams where the first word 
is word, that is, n1p =n11+ n12. 
np1 = the number of bigrams where the second 
word is word2, that is np1=n11+n21. 
n2p = the number of bigrams where the first word 
is not word1, that is n2p=n21+n22. 
np2 = the number of bigrams where the second 
word is not word2, that is np2=n12+n22. 
npp is the total number of bigram in the entire cor-
pus. 
Using the frequency statistics given in the contin-
gency table, expected frequencies, m11, m12, m21 
and m22 are calculated as follows: 
 
  m11 = (n1p*np1/npp) 
  m12 =  (n1p*np2/npp) 
  m21 = (np1*n2p/npp) 
  m22 =  (n2p*np2/npp) 
where: 
m11: Expected number of times both words in 
the bigram occur together if they are independent. 
m12: Expected number of times word1 in the bi-
gram will occur in the first position when word2 
does not occur in the second position given that the 
words are independent. 
m21: Expected number of times word2 in the bi-
gram will occur in the second position when word1 
does not occur in the first position given that the 
words are independent. 
m22: Expected number of times word1 will not 
occur in the first position and word2 will not occur 
in the second position given that the words are in-
dependent. 
The following association measures that use the 
above mentioned frequency statistics are used in 
our experiment. 
Phi, Chi and T-score: The Phi, Chi and T-score 
are calculated using the following equations:

Where co(w1,w2)=co-occurrence between the

S(w1,w2)= set of all sentences where both w1 and 
w2 occurs. 
d(s,w1,w2)= distance between w1 and w2 in a sen-
tence in terms of words. 
Significance Function: The significance func-
tion (Aswhini Agarwal et al, 2004) is defined as:

Where: 
 sigw1(w2) = significance of w2 with respect to w1. 
 fw1(w2) = number of w1 with which w2 has oc-
curred. 
Sig(w1,w2)= general significance of w1 and w2, 
lies between 0 and 1. 
?(x)= sigmoid function =exp(-x)/(1+exp(-x))] 
68
k1 and k2 define the stiffness of the sigmoid curve  
(for simplicity they are set to 5.0) 
? is defined as the average number of noun-noun 
co-occurrences.

4.4 Noun-noun MWE identification using 
random forest 
Random forest (Leo Breiman, 2000) is an ensem-
ble classifier that combines the predictions of 
many decision trees using majority voting to out-
put the class for an input vector.  Each decision 
tree participated in ensembling chooses a subset of 
features randomly to find the best split at each 
node of the decision tree. The method combines 
the idea of "bagging" (Leo Breiman, 1996) and the 
random selection of features. We use this algo-
rithm for our multiword identification task for sev-
eral reasons:  (1) For many data sets, it produces a 
highly accurate classifier (Rich Caruana et al 
2008), (2) It runs efficiently on large databases and 
performs well consistently across all dimensions 
and (3) It generates an internal unbiased estimate 
of the generalization error as the forest building 
progresses. 
The outline of the algorithm is given in the fig-
ure 2.  
Training Random Forests for noun-noun MWE 
identification requires candidate noun-noun MWEs 
to be represented as the feature vectors. For this 
purpose, we write a computer program for auto-
matically extracting values for the features charac-
terizing the noun-noun MWE candidates in the 
documents. For each noun-noun candidate MWE 
in a document in our corpus, we extract the values 
of the features of the candidate using the measures 
discussed in subsection 4.3. If the noun-noun can-
didate MWE is found in the list of manually identi-
fied noun-noun MWEs, we label the MWE as a 
?Positive? example and if it is not found we label it 
as a ?negative? example. Thus the feature vector 
for each candidate looks like {<a1 a2 a3 ?.. an>, 
<label>} which becomes a training instance (ex-
ample) for the random forest, where a1, a2 . . .an, 
indicate feature values for a candidate. A training 
set consisting of a set of instances of the above 
form is built up by running a computer program on 
the documents in our corpus. 
For our experiment, we use Weka 
(www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka) machine learning 
tools.  The random forest is included under the 
panel Classifier/ trees of WEKA workbench.. For 
our work, the random forest classifier of the 
WEKA suite has been run with the default values 
of its parameters. One of the important parameters 
69
is number of trees in the forest. We set this parame-
ter to its default value of 10.

5 Evaluation and results 
For evaluating the performance of our system the 
traditional precision, recall and F-measure are 
computed by comparing machine assigned labels 
to the human assigned labels for the noun-noun 
candidate MWEs extracted from our corpus of 274 
Bengali documents. 
5.1 Experimental dataset 
Our corpus is created by collecting the news ar-
ticles from the online version of well known Ben-
gali newspaper ANANDABAZAR PATRIKA 
during the period spanning from 20.09.2012 to 
19.10.2012. The news articles published online 
under the section Rajya and Desh on the topics 
bandh-dharmoghat, crime, disaster, jongi, mishap, 
political and miscellaneous are included in the cor-
pus. It consists of total 274 documents and all 
those documents contain 18769 lines of Unicode 
texts and 233430 tokens. We have manually identi-
fied all the noun-noun compound MWEs in the 
collection and labeled the training data by assign-
ing positive labels to the noun-noun compounds 
and negative labels to the expressions which are 
not noun-noun compounds. It consists of 4641 
noun-noun compound MWEs. Total 8210 noun-
noun compound MWE candidates are automatical-
ly extracted employing chunker and using heuristic 
rules as described in subsection 4.2. 
5.2 Results 
To estimate overall accuracy of our proposed 
noun-noun MWE identification system, 10-fold 
cross validation is done. The dataset is randomly 
reordered and then split into n parts of equal size. 
For each of 10 iterations, one part is used for test-
ing and the other n-1 parts are used for training the 
classifier. The test results are collected and aver-
aged over all folds. This gives the cross-validation 
estimate of the accuracy of the proposed system. 
J48 which is basically a decision tree included in 
WEKA is used as a single decision tree for com-
paring our system. The table 2 shows the estimated 
accuracy of our system. The comparison of the 
performance of the proposed random forest based 
system to that of a single decision tree is also 
shown in table 2. Our proposed random forest 
based system gives average F-measure of 0.852 
which is higher than F-measure obtained by a sin-
gle decision tree for bigram noun-noun compound 
recognition task.

6 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper presents a machine learning based ap-
proach for identifying noun-noun compound 
MWEs from a Bengali corpus. We have used a 
number of association measures, syntactic and lin-
guistic information as features which are combined 
Random forest learning algorithm 
 
Training phrase: 
For each of N decision trees to be built 
? Select a new bootstrap sample 
from training set 
? Grow an un-pruned decision tree 
on this bootstrap.  
? While growing a decision tree, at 
each internal node, randomly se-
lect mtry predictors (features) and 
determine the best split using only 
these predictors. 
? Do not perform pruning. Save the 
decision tree.  
Testing phase: 
For an input vector, output the class that is 
the mode of the classes produced by the all 
individually trained decision trees.

by a random forest learning algorithm for recog-
nizing noun-noun compounds. 
As a future work, we have planned to improve 
the noun-noun candidate MWE extraction step of 
the proposed system and/or   introduce new fea-
tures such as lexical features and semantic features 
for improving the system performance.
