Abstract
Much has been discussed about the chal-
lenges posed by Multiword Expressions
(MWEs) given their idiosyncratic, flexi-
ble and heterogeneous nature. Nonethe-
less, children successfully learn to use them
and eventually acquire a number of Mul-
tiword Expressions comparable to that of
simplex words. In this paper we report
a wide-coverage investigation of a partic-
ular type of MWE: verb-particle construc-
tions (VPCs) in English and their usage
in child-produced and child-directed sen-
tences. Given their potentially higher com-
plexity in relation to simplex verbs, we
examine whether they appear less promi-
nently in child-produced than in child-
directed speech, and whether the VPCs
that children produce are more conserva-
tive than adults, displaying proportionally
reduced lexical repertoire of VPCs or of
verbs in these combinations. The results
obtained indicate that regardless of any ad-
ditional complexity VPCs feature widely in
children data following closely adult usage.
Studies like these can inform the develop-
ment of computational models for language
acquisition.
1 Introduction
There has been considerable discussion about
the challenges imposed by Multiword Expres-
sions (MWEs) which in addition to crossing word
boundaries act as a single lexical unit at some lev-
els of linguistic analysis (Calzolari et al, 2002;
Sag et al, 2002; Fillmore, 2003). They include a
wide range of grammatical constructions such as
verb-particle constructions (VPCs), idioms, com-
pound nouns and listable word configurations,
such as terminology and formulaic linguistic units
(Wray, 2009). Depending on the definition, they
may also include less traditional sequences like
copy of in They gave me a copy of the book (Fill-
more et al, 1988), greeting formulae like how
do you do?, and lexical bundles such as I dont
know whether or memorized poems and famil-
iar phrases from TV commercials (Jackendoff,
1997). These expressions may have reduced syn-
tactic flexibility, and be semantically more opaque
so that their semantics may not be easily inferred
from their component words. For instance, to play
down X means to (try to) make X seem less im-
portant than it really is and not literally a playing
event.
These expressions may also breach general
syntactic rules, sometimes spanning phrasal
boundaries and often having a high degree of lex-
icalisation and conventionality. They form a com-
plex of features that interact in various, often un-
tidy, ways and represent a broad continuum be-
tween non-compositional (or idiomatic) and com-
positional groups of words (Moon, 1998). In ad-
dition, they are usually sequences or groups of
words that co-occur more often than would be ex-
pected by chance, and have been argued to appear
in the same order of magnitude in a speaker?s lex-
icon as the simplex words (Jackendoff, 1997).
In terms of language acquisition difficulties
may arise as the interpretation of these expres-
sions often demands more knowledge than just
about (1) unitary words and (2) word-to-word re-
lations. This introduces a distinction between
what a learner is able to computationally disam-
biguate or figure out automatically from language
and what must be explicitly stored/memorized
and retrieved whole from memory at the time of
43
use, rather than being subject to generation or
analysis by the language grammar (Wray, 2009,
p. 9). Yet, according to Fillmore et al (1988),
in an ideal learning environment, most of the
knowledge about how to use a language should
be computable while explicitly memorized se-
quences should be kept to a minimum.
Due to these idiosyncrasies they have been
noted as easily phonetically mislearned: e.g. by
and large mistaken for by in large, to all in-
tents and purposes for to all intensive purposes,
and an arm and a leg for a nominal egg (Fill-
more, 2003). For second language (L2) learn-
ers in particular (Wray, 2002) MWEs are in-
deed a well-known cause of problems and less
likely to be used by them than by native speak-
ers in informal spoken contexts (Siyanova and
Schmitt, 2007). Even if L2 learners may be capa-
ble of producing a large number of MWEs, their
underlying intuitions and fluency do not match
those of native speakers (Siyanova and Schmitt,
2008) and they may produce marked combina-
tions that are not conventionally used together
(e.g. plastic surgery/?operation, strong/?powerful
tea) (Pearce, 2002; Siyanova and Schmitt, 2007).
Given the potential additional sources of com-
plexity of MWEs for learning, in this paper we
investigate whether children shy away from us-
ing them when they communicate. We focus on
a particular type of MWEs, VPCs, which present
a wide range of syntactic and semantic idyosin-
crasies examining whether children produce pro-
portionally less VPCs than adults. In addition, we
analyze whether any potential added processing
costs for VPCs are reflected in a reduced choice
of VPCs or verbs to form these combinations in
child-produced sentences compared to adult us-
age. Finally, given the possibility of flexible word
orders in VPCs with the verb and particle not only
occurring adjacently but also with an NP object
between them, we compare these two groups in
terms of distances between the verb and the par-
ticle in these combinations, to determine whether
there is a preference for a joint or a split config-
uration and if children and adults adopt distinct
strategies for their usage. By profiling the VPC
usage by children our aim is to provide the basis
for a computational modeling of the acquisition of
these constructions.
This paper is structured as follows: in sec-
tion 2 describes VPCs and related works; sec-
tion 3 presents the resources and methods used in
this paper. The analyses of VPCs in children and
adults sentences are in section 4. We finish with
conclusions and possibilities of future works.
2 Related Work
VPCs are combinations of verbs and prepositional
(up, down, ...), adverbial (away, back,...), adjecti-
val (short,...) or verbal (go, be,...) particles, and in
this work we focus on VPCs with prepositional or
adverbial particles like put off and move on. From
a language acquisition perspective, the complex-
ity of VPCs arises from their wide syntactic as
semantic variability.
Syntactically, like simplex verbs, VPCs can oc-
cur in different subcategorisation frames (e.g. in-
transitive in break down and transitive in print NP
up). However, the type of verb and the num-
ber of arguments of a VPC seem to have an
impact in learning as both children with typical
development and with specific language impair-
ments (SLI) seem to use obligatory arguments and
inflectional morphology more consistently with
general all purpose verbs, like make, go, do, put,
than with more specific verbs. Moreover, as the
number of obligatory arguments increases chil-
dren with SLI seem to produce more general and
fewer specific verbs (Boynton-Hauerwas, 1998).
Goldberg (1999b) refers to these verbs as light
verbs, suggesting that due to their frequency of
use, they are acquired earlier by children, and sub-
sequently act as centers of gravity from which
more specific instances can be learnt. These verbs
are very common and frequent in the everyday
communication, that could be used in place of
more specialized instances (e.g. make instead of
build).
In transitive VPCs there is the additional diffi-
culty of the particle appearing in different word
orders in relation to the verb: in a joint configu-
ration, adjacent to the verb (e.g. make up NP) or
in a split configuration after the NP complement
(make NP up) (Lohse et al, 2004). While some
VPCs can appear in both configurations, others
are inseparable (run across NP), and a learner has
to successfully account for these. Gries (2002)
using a multifactorial analysis to investigate 25
variables that could be linked to particle place-
ment like size of the direct object (in syllables
and words), type of NP (pronoun or lexical), type
of determiner (indefinite or definite). For a set
44
of 403 VPCs from the British National Corpus
he obtains 84% success in predicting (adult) na-
tive speakers? choice. Lohse et al (2004) propose
that these factors can be explained by consider-
ations of processing efficiency based on the size
of the object NP and on semantic dependencies
among the verb, the particle, and the object. In a
similar study for children Diessel and Tomasello
(2005) found that the type of the NP (pronoun vs
lexical NP) and semantics of the particle (spatial
vs non-spatial) were good predictors of placement
on child language data.
Semantically, one source of difficulties for
learners comes from the wide spectrum of compo-
sitionality that VPCs present. On one end of the
spectrum some combinations like take away com-
positionally combine the meaning of a verb with
the core meaning of a particle giving a sense of
motion-through-location (Bolinger, 1971). Other
VPCs like boil up are semi-idiomatic (or aspec-
tual) and the particle modifies the meaning of the
verb adding a sense of completion or result. At the
other end of the spectrum, idiomatic VPCs like
take off, meaning to imitate have an opaque mean-
ing that cannot be straightforwardly inferred from
the meanings of each of the components literally.
Moreover, even if some verbs form combinations
with almost every particle (e.g., get, fall, go,...),
others are selectively combined with only a few
particles (e.g., book and sober with up), or do not
combine well with them at all (e.g., know, want,
resemble,...) (Fraser, 1976). Although there are
some semi-productive patterns in these combina-
tions, like verbs of cooking and the aspectual up
(cook up, boil up, bake up), and stative verbs not
forming VPCs, for a learner it may not be clear
whether an unseen combination of verb and parti-
cle is indeed a valid VPC that can be produced or
not. Sawyer (1999) longitudinal analysis of VPCs
in child language found that children seem to treat
aspectual and compositional combinations differ-
ently, with the former being more frequent and
employing a larger variety of types than the lat-
ter. The sources of errors also differ and while
for compositional cases the errors tend to be lexi-
cal, for aspectuals there is a predominance of syn-
tactic errors such as object dropping, which ac-
counts for 92% of the errors in split configura-
tion for children under 5 (Sawyer, 1999). Chil-
dren with SLI tended to produce even more object
dropping errors for VPCs than children with typ-
ical development, despite both groups producing
equivalent numbers of VPCs (Juhasz and Grela,
2008). Given that compositionality seems to have
an impact on learning, to help reduce avoidance
of phrasal verbs Sawyer (2000) proposes a seman-
tic driven approach for second language learning
where transparent compositional cases would be
presented first to help familiarization with word
order variation, semi-idiomatic cases would be
taught next in groups according to the contribu-
tion of the particle (e.g telicity or completive-
ness), and lastly the idiomatic cases that need to
be memorized.
In this paper we present a wide coverage ex-
amination of VPC distributions in child produced
and child-directed sentences, comparing whether
children reproduce the linguistic environment to
which they are exposed or whether they present
distinct preferences in VPC usage.
3 Materials and Methods
For this work we use the English corpora from
the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 1995)
containing transcriptions of child-produced and
child-directed speech from interactions involving
children of different age groups and in a variety
of settings, from naturalistic longitudinal studies
to task oriented latitudinal cases. These corpora
are available in raw, part-of-speech-tagged, lem-
matized and parsed formats (Sagae et al, 2010).
Moreover the English CHILDES Verb Construc-
tion Database (ECVCD) (Villavicencio et al,
2012) also adds for each sentence the RASP pars-
ing and grammatical relations (Briscoe and Car-
roll, 2006), verb semantic classes (Levin, 1993),
age of acquisition, familiarity, frequency (Colt-
heart, 1981) and other psycholinguistic and dis-
tributional characteristics. These annotated sen-
tences are divided into two groups according to
the speaker annotation available in CHILDES, the
Adults Set and the Children Set contain respec-
tively all the sentences spoken by adults and by
children1, as shown in table 1 as Parsed.
VPCs in these corpora are detected by look-
ing in the RASP annotation for all occurrences
of verbs followed by particles, prepositions and
adverbs up to 5 words to the right, following
Baldwin (2005), shown as Sentences with VPCs
1For the latter sentences which did not contain informa-
tion about age were removed.

in table 1. The resulting sentences are subse-
quently automatically processed to remove noise
and words mistagged as verbs. For these candi-
dates with non-alphabetic characters, like @ in
a@l up, were removed as were those that did not
involve verbs (e.g. di, dat,), using the Comlex
Lexicon as reference for verb validity (Macleod
and Grishman, 1998). The resulting sets are listed
as Sentences with VPCs Cleaned in table 1. The
analyses reported in this paper use these sen-
tences, and the distribution of VPCs per children
age group is shown in table 2. Given the non-
uniform amounts of VPC for each age group, and
the larger proportion of VPC sentences in younger
ages in these corpora, we consider children as a
unique group. For these, the individual frequen-
cies of the verb, the particle and the VPC are col-
lected separately in the children set and in the
adult set, using the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al,
2010).

Table 2: VPCs in Children Set per Age
To evaluate the VPCs in these sets, we use:
? English VPC dataset (Baldwin, 2008); which
lists 3,078 VPCs with valency (intransitive
and transitive) information;
? Comlex lexicon (Macleod and Grishman,
1998) containing 10,478 phrasal verbs;
? the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT)
lexicon (Carroll and Grover, 1989) with
6,351 phrasal verbs.
4 VPCs in Child Language
To investigate whether any extra complexity in the
acquisition of VPCs is reflected in their reduced
presence in child-produced than in child-directed
sentences, we compare the proportion of VPCs in
the Children and Adults Sets, table 3. In absolute
terms adults produced more than double the num-
ber of VPCs that children did. However, given
the differences in size of the two sets, in relative
terms there was a similar proportion of VPC us-
age in these corpora for each of the groups: 7.95%
of the sentences produced by children contained
VPCs vs 8.38% of those by adults. Moreover, the
frequencies with which these VPCs are used by
both children and adults reflects the Zipfian distri-
bution found for the use of words in natural lan-
guages, with a large part of the VPCs occurring
just once in the data, table 4. In addition, in terms
of frequency, children?s production of VPCs re-
sembles that of the adults.

?5 31.92% 31%
Table 4: VPC types per frequency
Another possible source of divergence between
children and adults is in the lexical variety found
in VPCs. The potential difficulties with VPCs
may be manifested in children producing a re-
duced repertoire of VPCs or using a smaller set
of verbs to form these combinations. As shown in
table 3, adults, as expected, employ a larger VPC
vocabulary with 1.56 more types than children.
However, an examination of the distributions of
types reveals that they only differ by a scale. As
a result when children frequencies are multiplied
by a factor of 2.16, which corresponds to the ra-
tio between VPC tokens used by adults and chil-
dren (table 3), the resulting distribution has a very
46
good match with the adult distribution, see fig-
ure 1. Therefore, the lower number of VPC types
used by children can be explained totally by the
lower number of sentences they produced, and the
hypothesis that difficulties in VPCs would lead to
their avoidance is not confirmed by the data.
Nonetheless, there is a discrepancy between
the distributions found for the higher frequency
VPCs. Children have a more uniform distribution
and adults tend to repeat more often the higher
frequency combinations (top left corner of fig-
ure 1). An evidence that this discrepancy is partic-
ular for high frequency VPCs, and not their con-
stituent verbs, is shown in figure 2. This figure
displays the rank plot for the verbs present in the
VPCs, for both adults and children. The same
scale factor used in figure 1 is applied to compen-
sate for the lower number of VPC sentences in the
children set. This time the match is extraordinary,
spanning the whole vocabulary.

It is important to verify if the same VPCs and
verbs are present in the both vocabularies, and fur-
ther if their orders in the ranks are similar. The
two groups have very similar preferences for VPC
usage, with a Kendall ? score of 0.63 which indi-
cates that they are highly correlated, as Kendall

very similar set of verbs in VPCs, with a Kendall

? score of 0.84 pointing to a very strong corre-
lation. We find less agreement between the or-
ders of VPCs and verbs for both children and
adults, indicating that the order of the verbs in
the data is not predictive of the relative frequen-
cies of VPCs. We examined (a) if children?s VPC
ranks followed their verb ranks, (b) if adults VPC
ranks followed their verb ranks and (c) if chil-
dren?s VPC ranks followed adults? verb ranks.
The resulting Kendall scores were around 0.2 for
all three cases. Moreover, if the lower frequency
VPCs are removed to avoid potential cases of
noise, the Kendall ? score for VPCs by adults and
children increases with the threshold, second line
from the top in Figure 3, while it remains constant
for all the other cases. As an example, the top 10
VPC types used by children and adults are listed
in table 5. From these, 9 out of the 10 are the
same differing only in the order in which they ap-
pear. Most of these combinations are listed in one
of the dictionaries used for evaluation: 72% for
adults and 75.87% for children. When a thresh-
old of at least 5 counts is applied these values go
up to 87.72% for adults and 79.82% for children,
as would be expected. This indicates that besides
any possible lack of coverage for child-directed
VPCs in the lexicons or noise, it is in the lower
frequency combinations that novel and domains
specific non-standard usages can be found. Some

Finally, despite adults having a larger verb vo-
cabulary used in VPCs than children, the two
groups have similar ratios of verb per VPCs: 2.81
VPCs for children and 2.79 for adults, table 6.
The top verbs used in VPCs types are also respon-
sible for very frequent VPC tokens (e.g. go, get,
come, take, put, make and move) accounting for
5.83% VPC types and 43.76% tokens for adults
and 7.02% of the types and 47.81% of the to-
kens for children, confirming the discrepancy dis-
cussed earlier. These are very general verbs and
some of the most frequent in the data, reported
among the first to be learned (Goldberg, 1999a)
which may facilitate their acquisition and use in
VPCs.
Comparing VPC types used by children and by
adults, this trend is confirmed: a large proportion
(72.32%) of the VPC types that children use is
also used by adults, Children ? Adult in table 6.
When low frequency VPCs types are removed,
this proportion increases (89.48%). Moreover,
when the VPCs used only by the adults are con-
sidered, most of these (93.44%) occur with fre-
quency lower than 5. This suggests that children
tend to follow quite closely the combinations em-
ployed by adults, and the lower frequency cases
may not yet be incorporated in their active vocab-
ulary.
In terms of the distance between verb and par-
ticle, there is a strong preference in the data for
joint combinations for both children and adults,
table 7. For the split cases, the majority contains
only one word between the verb and the particle.
Children in particular display a slight disprefer-
ence for longer distances between verbs and parti-
cles, and over 97% of VPCs have at most 2 words
between them.

Table 6: Number of VPC, Verb and Particle types by group, common usages
are reflected in their reduced usage by children.
The combination of these results shows that, de-
spite any additional difficulties, VPCs are as much
a feature in children?s data as in adults?. Children
follow very closely adult usage in terms of the
types and are sensitive to their frequencies, dis-
playing similar distributions to adults. They also
seem to use them in a similar manner in terms of
particle placement. Therefore no correction for
VPC complexity was found in this data.
Despite these striking similarities in many of
the distributions, there are still some discrepan-
cies between these two groups. In particular in the
VPC ranks, children present a more uniform dis-
tribution for higher frequency VPCs when com-
pared to adults. Moreover, there is a modest but
significant dispreference for longer distances be-
tween verb and particle for children. Whether
these reflect different strategies or efficiency con-
siderations deserves to be further investigated.
