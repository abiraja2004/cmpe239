An Argument about the Composition 
of Conceptual Structure 
Ray Jackendoff 
Brandeis University 
In order for people to be able to talk 
about what they perceive, there must be a level 
of mental representation at which information 
conveyed by language is compatible with infor- 
mation from sensory systems such as vision, 
nonverbal audition, touch, and so forth. I will 
call this level conceptual structure. Though 
the existence of conceptual structure has been 
more or less taken for granted (especially by 
the AI community), the need to consider it 
seriously has been brought to the attention of 
linguists rather recently, by such works as 
Fodor (1975) and Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976). 
This paper will present a combination of ling- 
uistic and visual evidence which bears on 
the nature of conceptual structure. 
i, Ge~eral properties of a theory of concep- 
tual structure 
A linguist's questions about conceptual 
structure can be separated into two major issues. 
The first, which the linguist shares with many 
branches of psychology, concerns the form of 
conceptual structure itself; the second, par- 
ticular to linguistics, concerns the mapping 
between conceptual structure and syntactic 
structure. An answer to the first question, 
within the theoretical paradigm l wi l lasSume~ 
will consist of a set of well-formedness rules 
for conceptual structure. The second will be 
answered by a set of correspondence rules 
which relate some subset of coneptual structures 
(the verbally expressible concepts) into some 
subset of syntactic structures (the meaningful 
sentences). 
It seems reasonable to assume for a first 
approximation that the well-formedness rules 
for conceptual structure are universal and 
innate, i.e. that everyone is born with the 
capacity to develop the same concepts. However, 
the actual concepts that one does develop will 
depend to some extent on experience--including 
possibly linguistic experience, so there is room 
for a certain amount of "Whorfian" variation if 
necessaly. 
On the other hand, this position is not con- 
sistent with what I gather is the strongest 
version of Piagetian developmental theory, 
which could be construed in the present frame- 
work as a claim that certain conceptual well- 
formedness rules must be learned. Rather, the 
development of the child's conceptual ability 
must be attributed to increasing richness and 
interconnection of concepts, or to growth either 
in the well-formedness rules or in computational 
capacity, over which the child and the environ- 
ment have little or no control. (The kind of 
growth I have in mind here is akin to the 
growth of bones and muscles: the environ- 
ment must furnish nourishment, but it hardly 
can be said to control the interesting aspects 
of structure. See Chomsky (1975) for discussion.) 
In addition to the assumption of univer- 
sality and innateness of the conceptual well- 
formedness rules, I will make three other 
assumptions about the theory of conceptual 
structure and its relation to language. First, 
a theory of conceptual structure must be obser- 
vationally adequate: as the level linking 
language and other perceptual systems, it must 
at least be able to express all the concep- 
tual distinctions made by natural language. 
In practice, this calls for an attempt to 
account for a lexically and gr~mmatically sig- 
nificant fragment of the language without 
artificial assumptions about the semantics (such 
as restriction to a microworld). 
Second, a theory of conceptual structure 
must provide some princip1~d way for the meanings 
of the parts of a sentence to be combined into 
the maaning of the whole sentence. This 
requirement of compositionality may be taken 
more or less strongly, depending on whether or 
not one requires each syntactic constituent (or 
even each word) of a sentence to correspond to 
a well-formed concept. 
Related to this second assumption is a third, 
that the correspondence rules relating syntax 
and conceptual structure be relatively simple. 
As motivation for this constraint, we observe 
that the language learner must relate syntactic 
form to understood meanings--in fact he must 
probably learn many aspects of syntactic form 
in part by figuring out from context what meaning 
is intended by other speakers. Since syntactic 
form varies from language to language, the corr- 
espondence rules must be at least partly learned. 
In order to be able to explain how the child 
manages to acquire language, we should 
strive for a theory in which at least the Sanguage- 
particular part of the correspondence rules is 
fairly straightforward. 
162 
A second argument for the simplicity of 
correspondence rules is more heuristic. Language 
is, after all, an information transmission system, 
conceptual structure being the information which 
language conveys. It would be perverse not to 
take as a working assumption that language is a 
relatively efficient and accurate encoding of 
the information it conveys--despite generations 
of philosophers who have assured us that language 
is impossibly unsystematic and vague. To give up 
this assumption is to refuse to look for principles 
in natural language semantics. Accept~g it 
entails that all deviations from efficient enco- 
ding be rigorously justified; what appears to 
be a quirky relationship betwenn Syntax and concep- 
tual structure may turn out to be merely a bad 
theory of conceptual structure. (See Goldsmith 
and Woisetschlaeger (1976), Jackendoff (1978) for 
arguments to this effect.) 
2. The argument: Figure formation and pragmatic 
anaphora 
The preliminaries complete, we turn to the 
main argument, which begins with a discussion 
of one aspect of visual perception before turning 
to linguistic matters. We then will draw 
consequences for conceptual structure, where 
visual and linguistic information interact. 
One of the most important and well-studied 
phenomena of visual perception is the emergence 
of a figure against a background. Intuitively, 
the figure is what attention is directed to; 
coherence or "thingness" inheres in the figure. 
It is often reported that the figure seems to 
stand out from the ground or to be imbued with 
greater vividness than the ground. The study of 
the figure-ground opposition has been one of the 
major preoccupations of the school of gestalt 
psychology (see e.g. KShler (1947), Koffka (1935)). 
For a simple and hopefully illustrative 
example, consider the contents of this page, in 
particular the geometric configuration in Figure I. 
Figure 1 
The whole of this configuration can form a visual 
figure seen against the background of the page. 
Parts of it can also emerge spontaneously as fi- 
gures; probably the most prominent are a square 
and an X, each of which can seen against the 
rest of the page (including the rest of the 
configuration) as background. Among less natural 
figures, which emerge only with more deliberate 
effort from Figure I, are such configurations 
as these (in order of decreasing salience, from 
left to right): 
Figure 2 
/ 
A number of important observations can be 
drawn from this simple example. 
i. The number of possible figures that can be 
be perceived in a given configuration is very 
large, perhaps unlimited; however, 
2. Only a small number of these are particularly 
salient. 
3. Relative salience of perceived figures is a 
function of both features of the physical 
signal and properties of the visual system. 
4. Features of the visual context can affect 
relative salience of figures. For example, 
the configurations in Figure 2 become much more 
likely to emerge from Figure 1 upon presen- 
tation of Figure 2; certain other possible 
figures (such as other arrow-shaped configu- 
rations) undoubtedly become somewhat more 
salient than before, while certain other 
possible figures not presented here remain 
as unlikely as before. 
5. Features of the visual signal interacting 
with the viewer's intention can make certain 
figures more salient than they otherwise 
might be. For example, more figures will 
emerge from Figure I if the viewer is instructed 
to find all possible figures. Similarly, this 
aspect of figure formation is crucial in 
children's puzzles which ask the reader to 
find three rabbits and two bears hidden in 
the forest, or in the Hirschfeld cartoons in 
the New York Times in which the reader in on 
the joke is to find a stipulated number of 
instances of the configuration NINA. These 
figures would not emergeat  all were it not 
for the reader's intention to find them. 
6. Features of the visual signal interacting 
with the viewer's knowledge may make certain 
figures more salient. Someone who has 
worked with automobile engines will perceive 
more distinct figures upon looking under the 
hood than a mechanical novice; a botanists 
may see a number of distinct plants where a 
layman sees only a tangled confusion. 
It is important to distinguish the conscious 
decomposition of a figure into parts from the 
process of figure formation itself. The former 
is available to awareness, and is in fact governed 
by principles of figure formation: as was seen 
in the example above, the perceived parts are 
themselves figures. On the other hand, the mental 
processes which bring about the emergence of a 
figure arethemselves not open to awareness, and 
the aspects of the configuration which are rele- 
vant to the character of the perceived figure 
may have little to do with the intuitive (i.e. 
conscious) decompositon of the figure. To make 
this clearer, consider the not atypical example 
of facial recognition. Though one can recog- 
nize and distinguish thousands of faces, one can- 
not in most cases consciously decompse faces and 
say specifically what makes them recognizable and 
different from each other. In present terms, 
each recognized face forms a remembered figure, 
but many of the distinctive features of faces do 
not themselves form figures and hence are not 
available to conscious awareness (see Carey (1976), 
and also Helmholtz's (1885) brief but insightful 
remarks (p. 369)). 
The observations we have made about the figure- 
163 
ground phenomenon have a bearing on the nature of 
conceptual structure. They suggest that there 
is a privileged set of conceptual structures 
which encode figures as unitary entities, and 
that this set is somehow related to conscious 
awareness. As far as consciousness is concerned, 
there is no representation of how figures are 
composed; though to other, unconscious, processes 
the composition of figures is accessible. Let 
us call this set of structures figural expressions. 
We now relate figural expression in concep- 
tual structure to language. Suppose someone 
points and simultaneously utters (i). 
(I) I bought that yesterday. 
What must the hearer do to fully understand the 
speaker? He must of course understand the words 
and the syntactic structure, and be able to use 
the correspondence rules involved in inter- 
preting the sentence; but he also must interpret 
the word that. In this particular utterance, 
that is a case of what Hankamer and Sag (1976) 
call "pragmatic anaphora." In order to under- 
stand the intended referent of a pragmatically 
controlled pronoun like that in (i), the hearer 
must pick something out of his visual field, 
perhaps aided by the speaker's pointing gesture. 
To make clearer the process of interpreting 
pragmatic anaphora, consider an example where no 
figure emerges which can correspond to a prag- 
matically controlled pronoun. Suppose speaker 
A utter (I) and points to a blurry photograph: 
"I bought that yesterday--isn't it gorgeous?" 
Speaker B, unable to make out anything in the 
picture, doesn't fully understand the utterance 
and responds "What are you talking about?" 
Suppose A then says, "That boat~" B peers at 
the picture and sure enough the figure of a 
boat emerges. He has a minor aha-experience: 
"Oh, that~ How could I miss it?" He now has 
received the message and discourse can continue. 
Every reader has probably had an experience 
like this; its relevance in the present setting 
is as follows: in order for a pragmatically 
controlled pronoun to be understood, its intended 
referent must emerge as a figure in the mind of 
the hearer, that is, it must have a represen- 
tation as a figural expression in conceptual 
structure. Thus we have established an important 
connection between the figure-ground phenomenon 
and pragmatic anaphora. 
So far we have dealt only with figures 
that correspond to things (or their shapes). By 
and large this has been the kind of figure 
that has been investigated. But as Hankamer and 
Sag (1976) point out, there are many sorts of 
pragmatic anaphora. 
(2) Here and there: 
Your coat is here (pointing) and your 
hat is there (pointing). 
(3) Do it: 
(Hankamer attempts to stuff a 9" ball 
through a 6" hoop) 
Sag: I t 's  not clear you'll be able to do it. 
(4) It happen: 
That (pointing) better not happen again. 
(5) Nominal identity-of-sense anaphora: 
a, (Sag produces an apple) 
Hankamer: Did you bring one for me? 
b. Those (pointing, e.g. to a (single) 
Cadillac) are expensive. 
(6) Manner adverb: 
( thus ) 
You shuffle cards I so ~ (demonstrating) 
%~his way) 
(7) Measure phrase: 
The fish that got away was 
(demonstrating) long. 
I this ) that yay 
There was more than that much (pointing-) 
in the jar when I left. 
The same conditions hold on the comprehensibility 
of these sorts of pragmatic anaphora as on that 
in (i). For example, if the hearer is unable 
to see or figure out what goings-on the speaker 
is pointing at in (4), he will not fully under- 
stand the utterance (in the sense of having 
received all the information he is intended to 
receive). 
Given that the existence of an appropriate 
figural expression in conceptual structure, 
supplied by the visual system, is necessary 
for the comprehension of pragmatic that-anaphora 
in (i), we must conclude similarly that a figural 
expression is necessary for all the sorts of 
pragmatic anaphora in (2)-(7) as well. But from 
the selectional restrictions involved in these 
constructions, we see that the figures involved 
cannot be things or shapes. Rather, each corres- 
ponds to a different sort of figure, distinct 
from things. Roughly, here and there correspond 
to places; do it to actions; it happen tp events; 
nominal identity-of-sense anaphora to categories 
or kinds; manner adverbials to manners; and 
measure phrases to amounts. Each of these types 
of figures represents a different organization 
of the visual field than do figures corresponding 
to physical objects. 
The existence of this variety of types of 
pragmatic anaphora suggests three points. First, 
the mind has the capacity to form figures of a 
number of distinct types on the basis of visual 
perception. Second, conceptual structure can 
represent such entities as places, actions, 
events, etc. as figural expressions,and this is 
why we can talk about them. Third, by the cri- 
terion of simplicity of correspondence rules, 
these entities are conceptually simple, since 
they correspond to something syntactically simple. 
More explicitly, that, a maximally simple NP, 
represents a minimally specified thing in (I), 
and the visual field is the source of the remaining 
information about the intended message. Similarly, 
the other expressions of pragmatic anaphora are 
maximally simple PPs, VPs, etc., and therefore 
should likewise correspond to minimally specified 
entities of the proper type; again, the remainder 
of the intended message is conveyed through the 
visual system. 
164 
3. The alternative to psychological and philo- 
sophical reductionism 
One might object that all these different 
types of entities should be reduced by the theory 
of conceptual structure to concurrences of 
physical objects over time (a four-dimensional 
space-time map, for example), and that such en- 
tities as places and events should play only a 
derivative role in linguistic semantics. But 
such a view generally assumes that the psycho- 
logical notion thing can be fairly simply 
correlated with physical objects via patterns 
of retinal stimulation; and this assumption is 
patently false. Most of the literature of per- 
ception is concerned with how we manage the re- 
markable feat of construing the world as full of 
more or less stable things, given constantly 
shifting patterns of retinal stimulation, and 
with how the things we see are or are not corre- 
lated with actual physical facts. It's'not easy. 
What seems to me a more productive approach 
is to abandon the goal of reduction and to claim 
that the types of entities referred to by the 
anaphoric expressions in (I)-(7) are all present 
as primitives of conceptual structure. Formally, 
this means that the well-formedness rules for 
conceptual structure must allow for figural 
expressions which correspond to each type. Fur- 
thermore, the well-formedness rules must provide 
an algebra of relationships among the types: a 
thing can be in a place, an event may have a 
certain number of things and places as consti- 
tuents, some events consist of an action performed 
by a thing (the agent), and so forth. Under this 
approach, linguistic semantics is not concerned 
with reducing out events, places, and so forth, 
but with clarifying their psychological nature and 
with showing how they are expressed syntactically 
and lexically. 
If any reduction is to take place, it will 
be in the theory of perception, which now must 
explain the relation of retinal (and auditory, etc.) 
stimuli to event- and place-perception as well 
as thing-perception. If this view is correct, 
one would expect these other aspects of percsption 
to have many of the same gestalt properties as 
thing-perception: dependence on proximity, clo- 
sure, "good form," and so forth. In fact, the 
few pieces of work I know of on perception of 
entities other than things (Michotte (1954) on 
causation, Jenkins, Wald, and Pittenger (1976) 
on events, remarks of KBhler (1947, pp. 89-90) 
on temporal grouping) do reveal just what we are 
led to expect. This suggests that there is no 
fundamental new difficulty for perception in 
admitting entities other than things into concep- 
tual structure--just more of the old problem of 
how we perceive anything at all. 
The argument of section 2 also explicitly 
addresses the important philosophical issue of the 
ontological commitment of natural language 
semantics: what entities should semantic theory 
allow language to talk about? The predominant 
philosophical tradition, modeling itself after 
mathematics, tries to minimize primitives and 
axioms. (It is perhaps not insignificant that 
Frege and Russell, the founders of modern logic, 
were most deeply concerned with foundations of 
mathematics.) Thus logicians mostly confine them- 
selves to semantic systems which contain only 
things and sets as pr/mitive ontological types. 
A few, such as Davidson (1967, 1969), have tried 
to argue that events and actions are necessary 
as well. But Davidson himself has some qualms 
about such entities, because criteria of indivi- 
duation are not easy to define. 
The view of language taken here, however, 
takes the ontological commitment of natural 
language semantics not to be a question of 
elegance, but an empirical question: what possible 
ontological types are psychologically real? The 
argment presented here, based on the interaction 
of language and visual experience, provides simple 
preliminary evidence for a relatively rich onto- 
logy. As further justification, one would hope 
to show that this ontology is necessary on both 
language-internal and perception-internal grounds 
independently. (Jackendoff (1978) gives linguis- 
tic arguments to justify the notion place.) One 
would also hope to come to terms with the philo- 
sophical traditions concerning reference, which 
will be drastically affected by the expansion. 
I am not prepared to reconstruct the entire edi- 
fice at this point; some arguments will appear 
in Jackendoff (in preparation). 
4. Conclusion 
The main argument of this paper combined 
perceptual and linguistic evidence to show that 
figural expressions in conceptual structure 
must include entities of a great number of 
ontological types. I take this to be a prototype 
for a novel sort of linguistic argumentation-- 
one that treats descriptive semantics as funda- 
mentally a psychological rather than logical 
discipline, and which seeks to account for the 
nature of thought and of human experience through 
grammatical structure. It is not clear that this 
is linguistics in the usual sense any more. Rather 
it is an attempt to use linguistic theory as a 
tool of cognitive psychology. This seems to me 
to be a promising way to go.
