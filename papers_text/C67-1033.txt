ABSTRACT. ? The outlines of an INTEGRATED LANGUAGE THEORY are drawn, 
with granmmr, semantics and text-theory as components. Problems of machine 
retrieva! and machine translation are discussed on the bas i~f  the outlined 
theory. 
At present it is unanimously agreed that no computational linguistics ? can be 
developed without an (before - hand constructed) eXact language theory. 
(The computer - handling of such an exact4theory is in no way a transparent 
problem). The aim of the present paper is to outline such an exact integrated 
language theory. 
The most promising basis for such a theory is the generative view on language. 
Unfortunately the generative theory of language is at present unsatisfacto- 
rily developed. First, this is true for generative grammars. But all other 
language theory constructions rely heavily on grammar (Katz & Fodor, Katz & 
Postal, Abraham & Kiefer). 
At present generative grammar consists of two components : a phrase - 
structure compgnent and a transformational one (I do not touch upon the 
problems of the phonemic and morphophonemic levels). In Chomaky's formula- 
tfon the phrase - structure component necessarily contains context-restricted 
rules. But this has the unpleasant consequence that the most important decision 
problems are unsolvable (in this component). Besides this, no satisfactory 
solution is formulated for the generation of discontinous structures. 
Chomsky's last formulation of this component has even some more inconveniences. 
The transformational component has no exact formulation as the transformational 
rules are unsatisfactorily defined. The problem of analysis is also not 
satisfactorily solved. 
For these reasons I propose a generative grammar also of two components : 
a matrix component and a transformational component. The matrix component 
consists of a regular elementary matrix ~rammar, containing only (ordered) 
elementary context - free rules , with Solvable main decision problems, 
and which generates in a natural way discontinous structures. Within the 
transformational component the notion of transformational rule is exactly 
defined. The problem of an adequate analysis (of the generated sentences), 
the main problem of generative language theory, is s~isfactori l  M solved 
- l "  
"r 
by introducing the following analyses (graphs) : morphological (which 
usually is called the (phrase - structure) derivational graph), syntactical 
(not considered in Chomsky's variant), configurational (not considered 
in Chomsky's variant). 
At present no (integrated) language theory can be conceived without a ? 
semantic component. In the theory which is outlined the semantic component 
is constructed as follows. A finite number of semantic categories (of the 
given language) are considered. Each word of the language is characterized 
by a proper semantic matrix and its definition . The dictionary of the language 
consists of triplets (word, proper semantic matrix, definition) called 
lexical issues. Each word of a configuration is characterized by its 
Semantic matrix and its definition. On the basis of the semantic matrices 
the notion of semantic regularity of configurations is defined. The semantic 
regularity of a sentence is defined as the condition of the semantic regula- 
rity of all the configurations in the configurational analysis of the 
sentence. The sense of a(semantic regular) sentence i~'its configu~ational 
graph, with all the words substituted by their lexical issues. The notion 
of truth is introduced (in accordance with Tarski), and three types of 
analiticity are defined : grammatical, semantical and deductive analit?icity. 
On the basis of the above outlined theory an exact text eomponen~?~is 
developed, i.e. a component of the integrated language theory which deals 
with units larger than the sentence. 
The outl inedintegrated language theory differs essentially from the 
constructions of Chomsky, Katz & Fodor, Katz et Postal, Abraham & Kiefer. 
The exactly (and formally) constructed language theory permits to give 
a satisfactory solution to the theoreticali~ based machine translation 
and machine retrieval. This last is formulated in the terms of A -oriented 
~bstract (of a paper), ~ - oriented abstract, N - oriented abstract, 
minimal N - oriented abstract, maximal N -oriented abstract and E - maximal 
superior N - oriented abstract.
