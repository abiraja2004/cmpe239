Abstract
This paper presents an efficient approach
to finding more bilingual webpage pairs
with high credibility via link analysis, us-
ing little prior knowledge or heuristics.
It extends from a previous algorithm that
takes the number of bilingual URL pairs
that a key (i.e., a URL pairing pattern) can
match as the objective function to search
for the best set of keys yielding the greatest
number of webpage pairs within targeted
bilingual websites. Enhanced algorithms
are proposed to match more bilingual web-
pages following the credibility based on
statistical analysis of the link relationship
of the seed websites available. With about
12,800 seed websites as test set, the en-
hanced algorithms improve precision over
baseline by more than 5%, from 94.06%
to 99.40%, and hence find above 20%
more true bilingual URL pairs, illustrating
that significantly more bilingual webpages
with high credibility can be mined with the
help of the link analysis.
1 Introduction
Parallel corpora of bilingual text (bitext) are indis-
pensable language resources for many data-driven
tasks of natural language processing, such as sta-
tistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1990),
cross-language information retrieval (Davis and
Dunning, 1995; Oard, 1997), and bilingual lexi-
cal acquisition (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed,
1997; Jiang et al, 2009), to name but a few. A
general way to develop such corpora from web
texts starts from exploring the structure of known
bilingual websites, which are usually organized

by their web masters in a way to facilitate both
navigation and maintenance (Nie, 2010). The
most common strategy is to create a parallel struc-
ture in terms of URL hierarchies, exploiting some
known naming conventions for webpages of corre-
sponding languages (Huang and Tilley, 2001; Nie,
2010). Following available structures and nam-
ing conventions, researchers have been exploring
various means to mine parallel corpora from the
web and a good number of such systems have
demonstrated the feasibility and practicality in au-
tomatic acquisition of parallel corpora from bilin-
gual and/or multilingual web sites, e.g., STRAND
(Resnik, 1998; Resnik, 1999; Resnik and Smith,
2003), BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), PTMiner
(Chen and Nie, 2000), PTI (Chen et al, 2004),
WPDE (Zhang et al, 2006), the DOM tree align-
ment model (Shi et al, 2006), PagePairGetter (YE
et al, 2008) and Bitextor (Espla`-Gomis and For-
cada, 2010).
Most of these systems are run in three steps:
first, bilingual websites are identified and crawled;
second, pairs of parallel webpages are extracted;
and finally, the extracted pairs are validated (Kit
and Ng, 2007). Among them, prior knowledge
about parallel webpages, mostly in the form of ad
hoc heuristics for identifying webpage languages
or pre-defined patterns for matching or comput-
ing similarity between webpages, is commonly
used for webpage pair extraction (Chen and Nie,
2000; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Zhang et al, 2006;
Shi et al, 2006; Yulia and Shuly, 2010; Toma?s
et al, 2008). Specifically, these systems exploit
search engines and heuristics across webpage an-
chors to locate candidate bilingual websites and
then identify webpage pairs based on pre-defined
URL matching patterns. However, ad hoc heuris-
tics cannot exhaust all possible patterns. Many
webpages do not even have any language label
in their anchors, not to mention many untrust-
worthy labels. Also, using a limited set of pre-
138
defined URL patterns inevitably means to give up
all reachable bilingual webpages that fall outside
their coverage.
Addressing such weaknesses of the previous ap-
proaches, we instead present an efficient bilingual
web mining system based on analyzing link rela-
tionship of websites without resorting to prior ad
hoc knowledge. This approach extends, on top of
re-engineering, the previous work of Kit and Ng
(2007). It aims at (1) further advancing the idea
of finding bilingual webpages via automatic dis-
covery of non-ad-hoc bilingual URL pairing pat-
terns, (2) applying the found pairing patterns to
dig out more bilingual webpage pairs, especially
those involving a deep webpage unaccessible by
web crawling, (3) discovering more bilingual web-
sites (and then more bilingual webpages) with
high credibility via statistical analysis of bilingual
URL patterns and link relationship of available
seed websites. The results from our experiments
on 12, 800 seed websites show that the proposed
algorithms can find considerably more bilingual
webpage pairs on top of the baseline, achieving
a significant improvement of pairing precision by
more than 5%.
2 Algorithm
This section first introduces the idea of unsuper-
vised detection of bilingual URL pairing patterns
(?2.1) and then continues to formulate the use of
the detected patterns to explore more websites, in-
cluding deep webpages (?2.2), and those not in-
cluded in our initial website list (?2.3).
2.1 Bilingual URL Pattern Detection
Our current research is conducted on top of the
re-implementation of the intelligent web agent to
automatically identify bilingual URL pairing pat-
terns as described in Kit and Ng (2007). The un-
derlying assumption for this approach is that rather
than random matching, parallel webpages have
static pairing patterns assigned by web masters for
engineering purpose and these patterns are put in
use to match as many pairs of URLs as possible
within the same domain. Given a URL u from the
set U of URLs of the same domain, the web agent
goes through the set U?{u} of all other URLs and
finds among them all those that differ from u by a
single token1 ? a token is naturally separated by
1If language identification has been done on webpages, it
only needs to go through all URLs of the other language.
a special set of characters including slash /, dot .,
hyphen -, and underscore in a URL. Then, the
single-token difference of a candidate URL pairs
is taken as a candidate of URL paring pattern,
and all candidate patterns are put in competition
against each other in a way to allow a stronger one
(that matches more candidate URL pairs) to win
over a weaker one (that matches fewer). For in-
stance, the candidate pattern <en,zh> can be de-
tected from the following candidate URL pair:
www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/en/fc/esc/e0.htm
www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/zh/fc/esc/e0.htm
The re-implementation has achieved a num-
ber of improvements on the original algorithm
through re-engineering, including the following
major ones.
1. It is enhanced from token-based to character-
based URL matching. Thus, more gen-
eral patterns, such as <e,c>, can be aggre-
gated from a number of weaker ones like
<1e,1c>, <2e,2c>, ..., etc., many of which
may otherwise fail to survive the competition.
2. The original algorithm is speeded up from
O(|U |2) to O(|U |) time, by building in-
verted indices for URLs and establishing
constant lookup time for shortest matching
URL strings.2
3. The language detection component has been
expanded from bilingual to multi-lingual and
hence had the capacity to practically handle
multilingual websites such as those from EU
and UN.
When detected URL patterns are used to match
URLs in a web domain for identifying bilingual
webpages, noisy patterns (most of which are pre-
sumably weak keys) would better be filtered out.
A straightforward strategy to do this is by thresh-
olding the credibility of a pattern, which can be
defined as
C(p, w) = N(p, w)
|w|
.
where N(p, w) is the number of webpages
matched into pairs by pattern p within website w,
and |w| the size ofw in number of webpages. Note
that this is the local credibility of a key with re-
spect to a certain website w. Empirically, Kit and
2Achieved by utilizing SecondString http://second
string.sf.net/
139
Ng (2007) set a threshold of 0.1 to rule out weak
noisy keys.
Some patterns happen to generalize across do-
mains. The global credibility of such a pattern p is
thus computed by summing over all websites in-
volved, in a way that each webpage matched by p
is counted in respect to the local credibility of p in
the respective website:
C(p) =
?
w
C(p, w)N(p, w).
Interestingly, it is observed that many weak keys
ruled out by the threshold 0.1 are in fact good pat-
terns with a nice global credibility value. In prac-
tice, it is important to ?rescue? a local weak key
with strong global credibility. A common practice
is to do it straightforwardly with a global credibil-
ity threshold, e.g., C(p)> 500 as for the current
work.
Finally, the bilingual credibility of a website is
defined as
C(w) = max
p
C(p, w).
It will be used to measure the bilingual degree of a
website in a later phase of our work, for which an
assumption is that bilingual websites tend to link
with other bilingual websites.
2.2 Deep Webpage Recovery
Some websites contain webpages that cannot be
crawled by search engines. These webpages do
not ?exist? until they are created dynamically as
the result of a specific search, mostly triggered by
JavaScript or Flash actions. This kind of webpages
as a whole is called deep web. Specifically, we
are interested in the case where webpages in one
language are visible but their counterparts in the
other language are hidden. A very chance that we
may have to unearth these deep hidden webpages
is that their URLs follow some common naming
conventions for convenience of pairing with their
visible counterparts.
Thus for each of those URLs still missing a
paired URL after the URL matching using our
bilingual URL pattern collection, a candidate URL
will be automatically generated with each applica-
ble pattern in the collection for a trial to access its
possibly hidden counterpart. If found, then mark
them as a candidate pair. For example, the pattern
<english,tc chi> is found applicable to the
first URL in Table 1 and accordingly generates the
second as a candidate link to its English counter-
part, which turns out to be a valid page.
2.3 Incremental Bilingual Website
Exploration
Starting with a seed bilingual website list of size
N , bilingual URL pairing patterns are first mined,
and then used to reach out for other bilingual web-
sites. The assumption for this phase of work is
that bilingual websites are more likely to be ref-
erenced by other bilingual websites. Accordingly,
a weighted version of PageRank is formulated for
prediction.
Firstly, outgoing links and PageRank are used
as baselines. Linkout(w) is the total number of
outgoing links from website w, and the PageRank
of w is defined as (Brin and Page, 1998):
PageRank(w) = r
N
+(1?r)
?
w?M(w)
PageRank(w)
Linkout(w)
,
whereM(w) is the set of websites that link tow in
the seed set of N bilingual websites, and r? [0, 1]
a damping factor empirically set to 0.15. Initially,
the PageRank value of w is 1. In order to re-
duce time and space cost, both Linkout(w) and
PageRank(w) are computed only in terms of the
relationship of bilingual websites in the seed set.
The WeightedPageRank(w) is defined as the
PageRank(w) weighted by w?s credibility C(w).
To reach out for a related website s outside the
initial seed set of websites, our approach first
finds the set R(s) of seed websites that have
outgoing links to s, and then computes the sum
of these three values over each outgoing link,
namely,
?
wLinkout(w),
?
wPageRank(w), and
?
wWeightedPageRank(w) for each w?R(s), for
the purpose of measuring how ?likely? s is bilin-
gual. An illustration of link relationship of this
kind is presented in Figure 1.
In practice, the exploration of related websites
can be combined with bilingual URL pattern de-
tection to literately harvest both bilingual websites
and URL patterns, e.g., through the following pro-
cedure:
1. Starting from a seed set of websites as the
current set, detect bilingual URL patterns and
then use them to identify their bilingual web-
pages.
2. Select the top K linked websites from
the seed set according to either
?
Linkout,
?
PageRank, or
?
WeightedPageRank.

3 Evaluation
The implementation of our method results in Pup-
Sniffer,3 a Java-based tool that has been released
for free. A series of experiments were conducted
with it to investigate the performance of the pro-
posed method on about 12, 800 seed websites. A
web interface was also implemented for evaluat-
ing the candidate bilingual webpage pairs identi-
fied by our system.
3.1 Seed Websites
The initial seed websites were collected from two
resources, namely
? Hong Kong Website Directory4 and
? Hong Kong World Wide Web Database.5
After the removal of invalid ones, 12, 800websites
were finally acquired as our seed set.6

3.2 URL Pattern Detection and Deep
Webpage Recovery
The enhanced algorithm described in Section 2.1
above was ran to extract credible URL patterns. In
general, the extracted patterns are valid as long as
the threshold is not too low ? it is set to C(p, w)>
0.1 in our experiments. A number of strongest pat-
terns found are presented in Table 2 for demon-
stration. Most of them, especially <en,tc> and
<eng,chi>, are very intuitive patterns. A full
list of URL pairing patterns detected in our exper-
iments is also available.7 Particularly interesting is
that all these patterns were identified in an unsu-
pervised fashion without any manual heuristics.
Using these patterns, the original algorithm re-
trieved about 290K candidate bilingual webpage
pairs. By the simple trick of rescuing weak lo-
cal patterns with the global credibility threshold
C(p) > 500, 10K more webpage pairs were fur-
ther found. Additionally, other 16K webpage
pairs were dug out from deep webpages by auto-
matically generating paired webpages with the aid
of identified URL patterns.

3.3 Website Exploration
To go beyond the original 12, 800 websites, the in-
cremental algorithm described in Section 2.3 was
run for one iteration to find outside bilingual web-
sites directly linked from the seeds. The top 500
of them, ranked by
?
Linkout,
?
PageRank and
?
WeightedPageRank, respectively, were manu-
ally checked by five students, giving the curves
of the total number of true bilingual websites and
overall precision per top N websites as plotted
in Figure 2. These results show that almost 50%
of the top 500 related outside websites ranked by
?
WeightedPageRank are true bilingual websites.
A higher precision indicates more bilingual web-
page pairs correctly matched by the URL patterns
in use.
After one iteration of the incremental algorithm,
37K more candidate bilingual webpage pairs were
found in the related outside websites, besides the
290K by the original algorithm. Table 3 presents
the number of webpage pairs identified by each
algorithm with a respective precision drawn from
random sampling. These results suggest that our
proposed enhancement is able to harvest above
20% more bilingual webpage pairs without de-
grading the overall precision. Error analysis shows
that around 80% of errors were due to mistakes
in language identification for webpages. For in-
stance, some Japanese webpages were mistakenly
recognized as Chinese ones.

4 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented an efficient ap-
proach to mining bilingual webpages via com-
puting highly credible bilingual URL pairing pat-
terns. With the aid of these patterns learned in
an unsupervised way, our research moves on to
exploring the possibility of rescuing weak local
keys by virtue of global credibility, uncovering
deep bilingual webpages by generating candidate
URLs using available keys, and also developing
an incremental algorithm for mining more bilin-
gual websites that are linked from the known bilin-
gual websites in our seed set. Experimental results
show that these several enhanced algorithms im-
prove the precision over the baseline from 94.06%
to 99.40% and, more importantly, help discover
above 20% more webpage pairs while maintain-
ing a high overall precision.
