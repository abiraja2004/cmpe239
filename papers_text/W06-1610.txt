Abstract 
In this paper, we present ParaEval, an 
automatic evaluation framework that uses 
paraphrases to improve the quality of 
machine translation evaluations. Previous 
work has focused on fixed n-gram 
evaluation metrics coupled with lexical 
identity matching. ParaEval addresses 
three important issues: support for para-
phrase/synonym matching, recall meas-
urement, and correlation with human 
judgments. We show that ParaEval corre-
lates significantly better than BLEU with 
human assessment in measurements for 
both fluency and adequacy. 
1 Introduction 
The introduction of automated evaluation proce-
dures, such as BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001) for 
machine translation (MT) and ROUGE (Lin and 
Hovy, 2003) for summarization, have prompted 
much progress and development in both of these 
areas of research in Natural Language Processing 
(NLP). Both evaluation tasks employ a compari-
son strategy for comparing textual units from 
machine-generated and gold-standard texts. Ide-
ally, this comparison process would be per-
formed manually, because of humans? abilities to 
infer, paraphrase, and use world knowledge to 
relate differently worded pieces of equivalent 
information. However, manual evaluations are 
time consuming and expensive, thus making 
them a bottleneck in system development cycles.  
BLEU measures how close machine-generated 
translations are to professional human transla-
tions, and ROUGE does the same with respect to 
summaries. Both methods incorporate the com-
parison of a system-produced text to one or more 
corresponding reference texts. The closeness be-
tween texts is measured by the computation of a 
numeric score based on n-gram co-occurrence 
statistics. Although both methods have gained 
mainstream acceptance and have shown good 
correlations with human judgments, their defi-
ciencies have become more evident and serious 
as research in MT and summarization progresses 
(Callison-Burch et al, 2006).   
Text comparisons in MT and summarization 
evaluations are performed at different text granu-
larity levels. Since most of the phrase-based, 
syntax-based, and rule-based MT systems trans-
late one sentence at a time, the text comparison 
in the evaluation process is also performed at the 
single-sentence level. In summarization evalua-
tions, there is no sentence-to-sentence corre-
spondence between summary pairs?essentially 
a multi-sentence-to-multi-sentence comparison, 
making it more difficult and requiring a com-
pletely different implementation for matching 
strategies. In this paper, we focus on the intrica-
cies involved in evaluating MT results and ad-
dress two prominent problems associated with 
the BLEU-esque metrics, namely their lack of 
support for paraphrase matching and the absence 
of recall scoring. Our solution, ParaEval, utilizes 
a large collection of paraphrases acquired 
through an unsupervised process?identifying 
phrase sets that have the same translation in an-
other language?using state-of-the-art statistical 
MT word alignment and phrase extraction meth-
ods. This collection facilitates paraphrase match-
ing, additionally coupled with lexical identity 
matching which is designed for comparing 
text/sentence fragments that are not consumed by 
paraphrase matching. We adopt a unigram count-
ing strategy for contents matched between sen-
tences from peer and reference translations. This 
unweighted scoring scheme, for both precision 
and recall computations, allows us to directly 
examine both the power and limitations of 
77
ParaEval.  We show that ParaEval is a more sta-
ble and reliable comparison mechanism than 
BLEU, in both fluency and adequacy rankings.  
This paper is organized in the following way: 
Section 2 shows an overview on BLEU and lexi-
cal identity n-gram statistics; we describe ParaE-
val?s implementation in detail in Section 3; the 
evaluation of ParaEval is shown in Section 4; 
recall computation is discussed in Section 5; in 
Section 6, we discuss the differences between 
BLEU and ParaEval when the numbers of refer-
ence translations change; and we conclude and 
discuss future work in Section 7.  
2  N-gram Co-occurrence Statistics 
Being an $8 billion industry (Browner, 2006), 
MT calls for rapid development and the ability to 
differentiate good systems from less adequate 
ones. The evaluation process consists of compar-
ing system-generated peer translations  to human 
written reference translations  and assigning a 
numeric score to each system. While human as-
sessments are still the most reliable evaluation 
measurements, it is not practical to solicit manual 
evaluations repeatedly while making incremental 
system design changes that would only result in 
marginal performance gains. To overcome the 
monetary and time constraints associated with 
manual evaluations, automated procedures have 
been successful in delivering benchmarks for 
performance hill-climbing with little or no cost.  
While a variety of automatic evaluation meth-
ods have been introduced, the underlining com-
parison strategy is similar?matching based on 
lexical identity. The most prominent implemen-
tation of this type of matching is demonstrated in 
BLEU (Papineni et al 2002). The remaining part 
of this section is devoted to an overview of 
BLEU, or the BLEU-esque philosophy.  
2 .1  The BL E U-esque Matching Philosophy 
The primary task that a BLEU-esque procedure 
performs is to compare n-grams from the peer 
translation with the n-grams from one or more 
reference translations and count the number of 
matches. The more matches a peer translation 
gets, the better it is.  
BLEU is a precision-based metric, which is 
the ratio of the number of n-grams from the peer 
translation that occurred in reference translations 
to the total number of n-grams in the peer trans-
lation. The notion of Modified n-gram Precisi on  
was introduced to detect and avoid rewarding 
false positives generated by translation systems. 
To gain high precision, systems could potentially 
over-generate ?good? n-grams, which occur mul-
tiple times in multiple references. The solution to 
this problem was to adopt the policy that an n-
gram, from both reference and peer translations, 
is considered exhausted after participating in a 
match. As a result, the maximum number of 
matches an n-gram from a peer translation can 
receive, when comparing to a set of reference 
translations, is the maximum number of times 
this n-gram occurred in any single reference 
translation. Papineni et al (2002) called this cap-
ping technique clipp ing.  Figure 1, taken from the 
original BLEU paper, demonstrates the computa-
tion of the modified unigram precision for a peer 
translation sentence.  
To compute the modified n-gram precision, 
P n, for a whole test set, including all translation 
segments (usually in sentences), the formula is: 
 
2 .2  Lack of Paraphrasing Support 
Humans are very good at finding creative ways 
to convey the same information. There is no one 
definitive reference translation in one language 
for a text written in another. Having acknowl-
edged this phenomenon, however natural it is, 
human evaluations on system-generated transla-
tions are much more preferred and trusted. How-
ever, what humans can do with ease puts ma-
chines at a loss. BLEU-esque procedures recog-
nize equivalence only when two n-grams exhibit 
the same surface-level representations, i.e. the 
same lexical identities. The BLEU implementa-
tion addresses its deficiency in measuring seman-
tic closeness by incorporating the comparison 
with multiple reference translations. The ration-
ale is that multiple references give a higher 
chance that the n-grams, assuming correct trans-
lations, appearing in the peer translation would 
be rewarded by one of the reference?s n-grams. 
The more reference translations used, the better

the matching and overall evaluation quality. Ide-
ally (and to an extreme), we would need to col-
lect a large set of human-written translations to 
capture all possible combinations of verbalizing 
variations before the translation comparison pro-
cedure reaches its optimal matching ability.  
One can argue that an infinite number of ref-
erences are not needed in practice because any 
matching procedure would stabilize at a certain 
number of references. This is true if precision 
measure is the only metric computed. However, 
using precision scores alone unfairly rewards 
systems that ?under-generate??producing un-
reasonably short translations. Recall measure-
ments would provide more balanced evaluations. 
When using multiple reference translations, if an 
n-gram match is made for the peer, this n-gram 
could appear in any of the references. The com-
putation of recall becomes difficult, if not impos-
sible. This problem can be reversed if there is 
crosschecking for phrases occurring across refer-
ences?paraphrase recognition. BLEU uses the 
calculation of a brevity penalty to compensate 
the lack of recall computation problem. The 
brevity penalty is computed as follows: 
 
Then, the BLEU score for a peer translation is 
computed as: 
 
BLEU?s adoption of the brevity penalty to off-
set the effect of not having a recall computation 
has drawn criticism on its crudeness in measur-
ing translation quality. Callison-Burch et al 
(2006) point out three prominent factors: 
? ``Synonyms and paraphrases are only 
handled if they are in the set of multiple 
reference translations [available].  
? The scores for words are equally 
weighted so missing out on content-
bearing material brings no additional pen-
alty.  
? The brevity penalty is a stop-gap meas-
ure to compensate for the fairly serious 
problem of not being able to calculate re-
call.? 
With the introduction of ParaEval, we will ad-
dress two of these three issues, namely the para-
phrasing problem and providing a recall meas-
ure.  
3  ParaEval for MT Evaluation 
3.1  Overview 
Reference translations are created from the same 
source text (written in the foreign language) to 
the target language. Ideally, they are supposed to 
be semantically equivalent, i.e. overlap com-
pletely. However, as shown in Figure 2, when 
matching based on lexical identity is used (indi-
cated by links), only half (6 from the left and 5 
from the right) of the 12 words from these two 
sentences are matched. Also, ?to? was a mis-
match. In applying paraphrase matching for MT 
evaluation from ParaEval, we aim to match all 
shaded words from both sentences. 
3 .2  Paraphrase Acquisition 
The process of acquiring a large enough collec-
tion of paraphrases is not an easy task. Manual 
corpus analyses produce domain-specific collec-
tions that are used for text generation and are 
application-specific. But operating in multiple 
domains and for multiple tasks translates into 
multiple manual collection efforts, which could 
be very time-consuming and costly. In order to 
facilitate smooth paraphrase utilization across a 
variety of NLP applications, we need an unsu-
pervised paraphrase collection mechanism that 
can be easily conducted, and produces para-
phrases that are of adequate quality and can be 
readily used with minimal amount of adaptation 
effort.  
Our method (Anonymous, 2006), also illus-
trated in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), to 
automatically construct a large domain-
independent paraphrase collection is based on the 
assumption that two different phrases of the 
same meaning may have the same translation in a

areas are matched by using BLEU.

foreign language. Phrase-based Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT) systems analyze large 
quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to 
learn translational alignments between pairs of 
words and phrases in two languages (Och and 
Ney, 2004). The sentence-based translation 
model makes word/phrase alignment decisions 
probabilistically by computing the optimal model 
parameters with application of the statistical es-
timation theory. This alignment process results in 
a corpus of word/phrase-aligned parallel sen-
tences from which we can extract phrase pairs 
that are translations of each other. We ran the 
alignment algorithm from (Och and Ney, 2003) 
on a Chinese-English parallel corpus of 218 mil-
lion English words, available from the Linguistic 
Data Consortium (LDC). Phrase pairs are ex-
tracted by following the method described in 
(Och and Ney, 2004) where all contiguous 
phrase pairs having consistent alignments are 
extraction candidates. Using these pairs we build 
paraphrase sets by joining together all English 
phrases that have the same Chinese translation. 
Figure 3 shows an example word/phrase align-
ment for two parallel sentence pairs from our 
corpus where the phrases ?blowing up? and 
?bombing? have the same Chinese translation. 
On the right side of the figure we show the para-
phrase set which contains these two phrases, 
which is typical in our collection of extracted 
paraphrases.  
Although our paraphrase extraction method is 
similar to that of (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 
2005), the paraphrases we extracted are for com-
pletely different applications, and have a broader 
definition for what constitutes a paraphrase. In 
(Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), a language 
model is used to make sure that the paraphrases 
extracted are direct substitutes, from the same 
syntactic categories, etc. So, using the example 
in Figure 3, the paraphrase table would contain 
only ?bombing? and ?bombing attack?. Para-
phrases that are direct substitutes of one another 
are useful when translating unknown phrases. 
For instance, if a MT system does not have the 
Chinese translation for the word ?bombing?, but 
has seen it in another set of parallel data (not in-
volving Chinese) and has determined it to be a 
direct substitute of the phrase ?bombing attack?, 
then the Chinese translation of ?bombing attack? 
would be used in place of the translation for 
?bombing?. This substitution technique has 
shown some improvement in translation quality 
(Callison-Burch et al, 2006).  
3 .3  The ParaEval Evaluation Procedure 
We adopt a two-tier matching strategy for MT 
evaluation in ParaEval. At the top tier, a para-
phrase match is performed on system-translated 
sentences and corresponding reference sentences. 
Then, unigram matching is performed on the 
words not matched by paraphrases. Precision is 
measured as the ratio of the total number of 
words matched to the total number of words in 
the peer translation.  
Running our system on the example in Figure 
2, the paraphrase-matching phase consumes the 
words marked in grey and aligns ?have been? 
and ?to be?, ?completed? and ?fully?, ?to date? 
and ?up till now?, and ?sequence? and ?se-
quenced?. The subsequent unigram-matching 
aligns words based on lexical identity.  
We maintain the computation of modified uni-
gram precisi on , defined by the BLEU-esque Phi-
losophy, in principle. In addition to clipping in-
dividual candidate words  with their correspond-
ing maximum reference counts (only for words 
not matched by paraphrases), we clip candidate 
paraphrases  by their maximum reference para-
phrase counts. So two completely different 
phrases in a reference sentence can be counted as 
two occurrences of one phrase. For example in 
Figure 4, candidate phrases ?blown up? and 
?bombing? matched with three phrases from the 
references, namely ?bombing? and two instances 
of ?explosion?. Treating these two candidate 
phrases as one (paraphrase match), we can see its 
clip is 2 (from Ref 1, where ?bomb ing? and ?ex-
plosion? are counted as two occurrences of a sin-
gle phrase). The only word that was matched by 
its lexical identity is ?was?. The modified uni-
gram precision calculated by our method is 4/5, 
where as BLEU gives 2/5.

process.

4  Evaluating ParaEval 
To be effective in MT evaluations, an automated 
procedure should be capable of distinguishing 
good translation systems from bad ones, human 
translations from systems?, and human transla-
tions of differing quality. For a particular evalua-
tion exercise, an evaluation system produces a 
ranking for system and human translations, and 
compares this ranking with one created by hu-
man judges (Turian et al, 2003). The closer a 
system?s ranking is to the human?s, the better the 
evaluation system is. 
4 .1  Validating ParaEval 
To test ParaEval?s ability, NIST 2003 Chinese 
MT evaluation results were used (NIST 2003). 
This collection consists of 100 source documents 
in Chinese, translations from eight individual 
translation systems, reference translations from 
four humans, and human assessments (on flu-
ency and adequacy). The Spearman rank-order 
coefficient is computed as an indicator of how 
close a system ranking is to gold-standard human 
ranking. It should be noted that the 2003 MT 
data is separate from the corpus that we extracted 
paraphrases from.  
For comparison purposes, BLEU 1  was also 
run. Table 1 shows the correlation figures for the 
two automatic systems with the NIST rankings 
on fluency and adequacy. The lower and higher 
95% confidence intervals are labeled as ?L-CI? 
and ?H-CI?. To estimate the significance of the 
rank-order correlation figures, we applied boot-
strap resampling to calculate the confidence in-
tervals.  In each of 1000 runs, systems were 
ranked based on their translations of 100 ran-
domly selected documents.  Each ranking was 
compared with the NIST ranking, producing a 
correlation score for each run. A t-test was then

performed on the 1000 correlation scores. In both 
fluency and adequacy measurements, ParaEval 
correlates significantly better than BLEU. The 
ParaEval scores used were precision scores. In 
addition to distinguishing the quality of MT sys-
tems, a reliable evaluation procedure must be 
able to distinguish system translations from hu-
mans? (Lin and Och, 2004). Figure 5 shows the 
overall system and human ranking. In the upper 
left corner, human translators are grouped to-
gether, significantly separated from the auto-
matic MT systems clustered into the lower right 
corner.  
4 .2  Implications to Word-alignment 
We experimented with restricting the para-
phrases being matched to various lengths. When 
allowing only paraphrases of three or more 
words to match, the correlation figures become 
stabilized and ParaEval achieves even higher 
correlation with fluency measurement to 0.7619 
on the Spearman ranking coefficient.   
This phenomenon indicates to us that the bi-
gram and unigram paraphrases extracted using 
SMT word-alignment and phrase extraction pro-
grams are not reliable enough to be applied to 
evaluation tasks. We speculate that word pairs 
extracted from (Liang et al, 2006), where a bidi-
rectional discriminative training method was 
used to achieve consensus for word-alignment

(mostly lower n-grams), would help to elevate 
the level of correlation by ParaEval.  
4 .3  Implications to Evaluating Paraphrase 
Quality 
Utilizing paraphrases in MT evaluations is also a 
realistic way to measure the quality of para-
phrases acquired through unsupervised channels. 
If a comparison strategy, coupled with para-
phrase matching, distinguishes good and bad MT 
and summarization systems in close accordance 
with what human judges do, then this strategy 
and the paraphrases used are of sufficient quality. 
Since our underlining comparison strategy is that 
of BLEU-1 for MT evaluation, and BLEU has 
been proven to be a good metric for their respec-
tive evaluation tasks, the performance of the 
overall comparison is directly and mainly af-
fected by the paraphrase collection.  
5  ParaEval?s Support for Recall Com-
putation 
Due to the use of multiple references and allow-
ing an n-gram from the peer translation to be 
matched with its corresponding n-gram from any 
of the reference translations, BLEU cannot be 
used to compute recall scores, which are conven-
tionally paired with precision to detect length-
related problems from systems under evaluation.  
5 .1  Using Single References for Recall 
The primary goal in using multiple references is 
to overcome the limitation in matching on lexical 
identity. More translation choices give more 
variations in verbalization, which could lead to 
more matches between peer and reference trans-
lations. Since MT results are generated and 
evaluated at a sentence-to-sentence level (or a 
segment level, where each segment may contain 
a small number of sentences) and no text con-
densation is employed, the number of different 
and correct ways to state the same sentence is 
small. This is in comparison to writing generic 
multi-document summaries, each of which con-
tains multiple sentences and requires significant 
amount of ?rewriting?. When using a large col-
lection of paraphrases while evaluating, we are 
provided with the alternative verbalizations 
needed. This property allows us to use single 
references to evaluate MT results and compute 
recall measurements.  
5 .2  Recall and Adequacy Correlations 
When validating the computed recall scores for 
MT systems, we correlate with human assess-
ments on adequacy only. The reason is that ac-
cording to the definition of recall, the content 
coverage in references, and not the fluency re-
flected from the peers, is being measured. Table 
2 shows ParaEval?s recall correlation with NIST 
2003 Chinese MT evaluation results on systems 
ranking. We see that ParaEval?s correlation with 
adequacy has improved significantly when using 
recall scores to rank than using precision scores.  
5 .3  Not All Single References are Created 
Equal 
Human-written translations differ not only in 
word choice, but also in other idiosyncrasies that 
cannot be captured with paraphrase recognition. 
So it would be presumptuous to declare that us-
ing paraphrases from ParaEval is enough to al-
low using just one reference translation to evalu-
ate. Using multiple references allow more para-
phrase sets to be explored in matching.  
In Table 3, we show ParaEval?s correlation 
figures when using single reference translations. 
E01?E04 indicate the sets of human translations 
used correspondingly.  
Notice that the correlation figures vary a great 
deal depending on the set of single references 
used. How do we differentiate human transla-
tions and know which set of references to use? It 
is difficult to quantify the quality that a human 
written translation reflects. We can only define 
?good? human translations as translations that 
are written not very differently from what other 
humans would write, and ?bad? translations as 
the ones that are written in an unconventional 
fashion. Table 4 shows the differences between 
the four sets of reference translations when com-

paring one set of references to the other three. 
The scores here are the raw ParaEval precision 
scores. E01 and E03 are better, which explains 
the higher correlations ParaEval has using these 
two sets of references individually, shown in Ta-
ble 3.  
6  Observation of Change in Number of 
References 
When matching on lexical identity, it is the gen-
eral consensus that using more reference transla-
tions would increase the reliability of the MT 
evaluation (Turian et al, 2003). It is expected 
that we see an improvement in ranking correla-
tions when moving from using one reference 
translation to more. However, when running 
BLEU for the NIST 2003 Chinese MT evalua-
tion, this trend is inverted, and using single refer-
ence translation gave higher correlation than us-
ing all four references, as illustrated in Table 5.  
Turian et al (2003) reports the same peculiar 
behavior from BLEU on Arabic MT evaluations 
in Figure 5b of their paper. When using three 
reference translations, as the number of segments 
(sentences usually) increases, BLEU correlates 
worse than using single references.  
Since the matching and underlining counting 
mechanisms of ParaEval are built upon the 
fundamentals of BLEU, we were keen to find out 
the differences, other than paraphrase matching, 
between the two methods when the number of 
reference translation changes. By following the 
description from the original BLEU paper, three 
incremental steps were set up for duplicating its 
implementation, namely modified unigram preci-
sion (MUP), geometric mean of MUP (GM), and 
multiplying brevity penalty with GM to get the 
final score (BP-BLEU). At each step, correla-
tions were computed for both using single- and 
multi- references, shown in Table 6a, b, and c. 
 Given that many small changes have been 
made to the original BLEU design, our replica-
tion would not produce the same scores from the 
current version of BLEU. Nevertheless, the in-
verted behavior was observed in fluency correla-
tions at the BP-BLEU step, not at MUP and GM. 
This indicates to us that the multiplication of the 
brevity penalty to balance precision scores is 
problematic. According to (Turian et al, 2003), 
correlation scores computed from using fewer 
references are inflated because the comparisons 
exclude the longer n-gram matches that make 
automatic evaluation procedures diverge from 
the human judgments. Using a large collection of 
paraphrases in comparisons allows those longer 
n-gram matches to happen even if single refer-
ences are used. This collection also allows 
ParaEval to directly compute recall scores, 
avoiding an approximation of recall that is 
problematic.

7  Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we have described ParaEval, an 
automatic evaluation framework for measuring 
machine translation results. A large collection of 
paraphrases, extracted through an unsupervised 
fashion using SMT methods, is used to improve 
the quality of the evaluations. We addressed 
three important issues, the paraphrasing support, 
the computation of recall measurement, and pro-
viding high correlations with human judgments.  
Having seen that using paraphrases helps a 
great deal in evaluation tasks, naturally the next 
task is to explore the possibility in paraphrase 
induction. The question becomes how to use con-
textual information to calculate semantic close-
ness between two phrases. Can we expand the 
identification of paraphrases to longer ones, ide-
ally sentences?  
The problem in which content bearing words 
carry the same weights as the non-content bear-
ing ones is not addressed. From examining the 
paraphrase extraction process, it is unclear how 
to relate translation probabilities and confidences 
with semantic closeness. We plan to explore the 
parallels between the two to enable a weighted 
implementation of ParaEval.
