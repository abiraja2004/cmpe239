Abstract
We present a novel scheme of spoken dialogue
systems which uses the up-to-date informa-
tion on the web. The scheme is based on in-
formation extraction which is defined by the
predicate-argument (P-A) structure and real-
ized by semantic parsing. Based on the in-
formation structure, the dialogue system can
perform question answering and also proac-
tive information presentation. Feasibility of
this scheme is demonstrated with experiments
using a domain of baseball news. In order to
automatically select useful domain-dependent
P-A templates, statistical measures are intro-
duced, resulting to a completely unsupervised
learning of the information structure given a
corpus. Similarity measures of P-A structures
are also introduced to select relevant infor-
mation. An experimental evaluation shows
that the proposed system can make more rel-
evant responses compared with the conven-
tional ?bag-of-words? scheme.
1 Introduction
Recently, a huge amount of information is accumu-
lated and distributed on the web day by day. As a
result, many people get information via web rather
than the conventional mass media. On the other
hand, the amount of information on the web is so
huge that we often encounter the difficulty in finding
information we want. Keyword search is the most
widely-used means for the web information access.
However, this style is not necessarily the best for
information demands of all users who do not have
definite goals or just want to know what would be
interesting. To cope with user?s vague information
demands is an important mission for interactive spo-
ken dialogue systems. Moreover, supporting user?s
information collection in a small-talk style is one of
the new directions of spoken dialogue systems.
Existing spoken dialogue systems can be clas-
sified into two types (T.Kawahara, 2009): those
using relational databases (RDB) such as the Air-
line Travel Information System (ATIS) (D.A.Dahl,
1994), and those using information retrieval tech-
niques based on statistical document matching
(T.Misu and T.Kawahara, 2010). The first scheme
can achieve a well-defined task by using a struc-
tural database, but this scheme cannot be applied to
the web information in which the structure and task
are not well defined. The second scheme has been
studied to handle large-scale texts such as web, but
most of the conventional systems adopt a ?bag-of-
words? model, and naive statistical matching often
generates irrelevant responses which have nothing
to do with the user?s requests. Our proposed scheme
solves this problem by using information extraction
based on semantic parsing from web texts, with-
out constructing an RDB. We adopt the predicate-
argument (P-A) structure generated by a parser as
a baseline, but every P-A structure is not useful for
information extraction and retrieval(Y.Kiyota et al,
2002; M.O.Dzikovska et al, 2003; S.Harabagiu et
al., 2005). In fact, the useful information structure
is dependent on domains. Conventionally, the tem-
plates for information extraction were hand-crafted
(R.Grishman, 2003), but this heuristic process is so
costly that it cannot be applied to a variety of do-
mains on the web. In this paper, therefore, we pro-

pose a filtering method of predicate-argument (P-A)
patterns generated by the parser, in order to automat-
ically define the domain-dependent useful informa-
tion structure.
We also address flexible matching based on the P-
A structure, because the exact matching often fails
and does not generate any outputs. In order to re-
trieve most relevant information, we define similar-
ity measures of predicates and arguments, which are
also learned from a domain corpus.
In this paper, the proposed scheme is applied to a
domain of baseball news, and implemented as a spo-
ken dialogue system which can reply to the user?s
question as well as make proactive information pre-
sentation using a news website. An overview of this
system is described in Section 2, and the template
filtering method is presented in Section 3. Then, sys-
tem response generation based on flexible matching
is explained in Section 4. Finally, an evaluation of
the system is presented in Section 5.
2 System Overview
2.1 Architecture
The architecture of the proposed spoken dialogue
system is depicted in Fig. 1. First, information ex-
traction is conducted by parsing web texts in ad-
vance. A user?s query is also parsed to extract the
same information structure, and the system matches
the extracted information against the web informa-
tion. According to the matching result, the system
either answers the user?s question or makes proac-
tive presentation of information which should be
most relevant to the user?s request.
If the system finds some information which com-

logue.
pletely matches the user?s query, the system makes
a response using the corresponding web text. When
the system cannot find exact information, it searches
for some information which matches partially. For
example, in Fig. 2, when a user asked ?Did Ichiro
hit a home-run??, the system cannot find exact in-
formation ?[Ichiro (agent), home-run (object), hit]?,
but finds ?[Lopez (agent), three-run homer (object),
hit]? which is partially matched and most relevant.
This information is used to generate a relevant re-
sponse that the user would expect.
In the conventional RDB-based dialogue scheme,
the system hardly makes relevant responses if it
finds no matched entries, thus usually replies ?There
is no matched entries?. In the conventional question-
answering scheme, the same situation often hap-
pens. Occasionally, a set of close-matched answers
may be found by statistical matching, but the found
answers may not be relevant to the user?s query. In
the proposed scheme, we guarantee that the answer
is at least partially matched to the user?s query in
terms of the information structure.
2.2 Information Extraction based on P-A
Structure
We use the predicate argument (P-A) structure to de-
fine the information structure from web texts. The
P-A structure represents a sentence with a predicate,
arguments and their semantic cases, as shown in the
previous examples. There are some required se-
mantic cases depending on the type of the predicate
(verb), and also arbitrary semantic cases like time,
place, and other modifications. This structure is a
classic concept in natural language processing, but
recently, automatic semantic parsing has reached a
practical level thanks to corpus-based learning tech-
60
niques (D.Kawahara and S.Kurohashi, 2006) and
has been used for several large-scale tasks (D.Shen
and M.Lapata, 2007; R.Wang and Y.Zhang, 2009;
D.Wu and P.Fung, 2009). We use KNP1 as a syntac-
tic and semantic parser.
3 Extraction of Domain-Dependent P-A
Templates
The P-A structure automatically generated by the
semantic parser provides useful information struc-
ture as a baseline. However, every P-A pair is not
meaningful in information navigation; actually, only
a fraction of the patterns are useful, and they are
domain-dependent. For example, in the baseball do-
main, key patterns include ?[A (agent) beat B (ob-
ject)]? and ?[A (agent) hit B (object)]?, and in the
business domain, ?[A (agent) sell B (object)]? and
?[A (agent) acquire B (object)]?. We propose a
method to automatically extract these useful patterns
given a domain corpus. We assume each article in
the newspaper corpus/websites is annotated with a
domain such as sports-baseball and economy-stock.
The method is to filter P-A structure patterns
(=templates) based on some statistical measure
which accounts for the domain. The filtering pro-
cess is also expected to eliminate inappropriate pat-
terns caused by parsing errors. Moreover, in spoken
dialogue systems, errors in automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) may result in erroneous matching. By
eliminating irrelevant patterns, we expect robust in-
formation extraction for spoken input.
Specifically, the following two significance mea-
sures are investigated in this work.
3.1 TF-IDF Measure
First, we use the TF-IDF measure to evaluate impor-
tance of word wi in a particular domain or topic t.
tfidf(wi, t) = P (wi|t) log
C(d)
C(d : wi ? d)
(1)
The TF term is the occurrence probability of word
wi, defined as:
P (wi|t) ?
C(wi, t) + ?
?
j
(
C(wj , t) + ?
) (2)
1http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/knp.html
where C(wi, t) is the occurrence count of word wi
in the domain t in the corpus, and ? is a smooth-
ing factor given by the Dirichlet process prior. The
IDF term is the inverse log probability of documents
containing word wi:
C(d)
C(d : wi ? d)
? C(d) + ?
C(d : wi ? d) + ?
(3)
where C(d) is the number of documents (=newspa-
per articles) in the corpus and C(d : wi ? d) is
the number of documents which contain wi. ? is
a smoothing factor given by the Dirichlet process
prior. We estimate ? and ? by a likelihood function
using the training corpus. We compute the TF-IDF
value for a predicate and each argument, and then
compute their geometric mean to define the evalua-
tion measure for a P-A template.
3.2 Naive Bayes (NB) Model
The second measure is based on the Naive Bayes
model.
P (t|wi) =
C(wi, t) + Dt?
C(wi) + ?
(4)
Here, ? is a smoothing factor and Dt is a normal-
ization coefficient of the corpus size of the domain
t.
Dt =
?
j C(wj , t)
?
k C(wk)
. (5)
The evaluation measure for a P-A pattern is ob-
tained by taking a geometric mean of the component
words.
3.3 Clustering of Named Entities
The statistical learning often falls in the data sparse-
ness problem, especially for proper nouns, for ex-
ample, name of persons. Moreover, there may be
mismatch in the set of named entities between the
training corpus and the test phase. For robust estima-
tion, we introduce classes for named entities (name
of persons, organizations, places). Note that unify-
ing all named entities in the corpus before comput-
ing the evaluation measure would weaken the sig-
nificance of these entities. Thus, we compute statis-
tics for every proper noun before clustering, and sum
up values for the class afterwards. For example, the
score for ?[[person](agent), hit]? is computed as a
sum over all persons of this pattern.

3.4 Evaluation of Template Filtering
We performed an experimental evaluation to com-
pare the effectiveness of the two significance mea-
sures (TF-IDF and Naive Bayes (NB)) in the
Japanese professional baseball domain. The mod-
els are trained with the Mainichi Newspaper cor-
pus 2008. The clustering of named entities is ap-
plied to both methods. The P-A templates hav-
ing larger significance scores are selected. We de-
termined a threshold for selecting templates using
a development set which was held out from the
test set by 10%. The test set was made from
Mainichi newspaper?s website which talks about
games played between April 21-23, 2010. Manual
annotation was made on typical predicates and se-
mantic cases which can be used for question answer-
ing and proactive presentation. The filtering was
performed on the test set by matching the patterns
defined by each measure, and evaluated against the
annotated answers in terms of recall, precision and
F-measure (F). Table 1 lists the result for the two
measures using predicate-only, argument-only, and
both of them.
In this result, using both predicates and arguments
in the Naive Bayes (NB) model performs the best.
Compared with the baseline without any filtering,
the proposed methods significantly improved pre-
cision with some degradation of recall. This prop-
erty is important in realizing informative response
generation robust against ASR and parsing errors.
Among the selected templates, we can find typical
and important patterns like ?have a win?, ?come into
pitch?, and ?make it consecutive wins?. Most of re-
call errors are infrequent patterns, and majority of
precision errors are those patterns that are frequently
observed but not useful for presentation.
4 Presentation of Relevant Information
When the system fails to find exact information that
matches the user?s query, or the user does not speak
for a while, the system tries to make proactive in-
formation presentation. It is based on the partially
matched entries of the current or latest query. The
fall-back is similar to collaborative response gener-
ation in the conventional spoken dialogue systems
(D.Sadek, 1999), but it is intended for proactive in-
formation presentation using general documents.
4.1 Response generation based on partial
matching
For preference among multiple components in the
P-A pattern of the user query, we make use of the
significance measure defined in Section 3. Specifi-
cally, we relax (=ignore) the component of the least
significance score, then search for relevant informa-
tion. If any entry is not still matched, we relax the
next less significant component. If multiple entries
are found with this matching, we need to select the
most relevant entry. Thus, we introduce two scores
of relevance. The relevance measure is defined in
different manners for predicates (=verbs) and argu-
ments (=nouns). The measure for arguments is de-
fined based on the co-occurrence statistics in the cor-
pus. The measure for predicate is defined based on
distributional analysis of arguments.
4.2 Relevance measure of arguments
The relevance of argument words (=nouns) wi and
wj is defined as
simarg(wi, wj) =
{C(wi, wj)}2
C(wi) ? C(wj)
. (6)
Here, wi is in the original query, and relaxed (ig-
nored) in the partial matching, and wj of the best
relevance score is retrieved for response generation.
In the example of Fig. 2, wi is ?Ichiro? and wj is
?Lopez?.
4.3 Relevance measure of predicates
Distributional analysis (Z.Harris, 1951; Lin, 1998)
has been used to define similarity of words, assum-
ing that similar words have similar contexts. In this
paper, we use the distribution of arguments which
have a modification relation to predicates (Fig. 3)

Figure 3: Distribution analysis of P-A structure.
(T.Shibata et al, 2008; P.Pantel et al, 2009). The
relevance of predicate words wprei and wprej is de-
fined as a cosine distance of occurrence vectors of
the modifying arguments(J.Mitchell and M.Lapata,
2008; S.Thater et al, 2010). Here, argument en-
tries are distinguished by their semantic cases such
as Agent and Object, as shown in Fig 3. As the dis-
tribution of arguments is sparse and its reliable esti-
mation is difficult, we introduce smoothing by using
another distributional analysis of arguments, which
is similar to the one in the previous section.
4.4 Bag-of-Words (BOW) Model
If no entry is matched with all possible partial
matching, we resort to the naive ?bag-of-words?
(BOW) model, in which a sentence is represented
with a vector of word occurrence and matching is
done based on this vector. This method is widely
used for document retrieval. We count only content
words. In this method, we make use of the signifi-
cance score for preference of the words when multi-
ple candidates are matched for a short query.
The overall matching strategy of the proposed
scheme is summarized in Fig. 4.
4.5 Selection of Relevant Information from
Sentence
Answer or information presentation is generated
based on the matched sentence in a newspaper ar-
ticle. As a sentence is often complex or made of
multiple predicates, simple presentation of the sen-
tence would be redundant or even irrelevant. There-
fore, we select the portion of the matched P-A struc-
ture, to generate a concise response relevant to the
user?s query. For example, when a sentence ?Ichiro
hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning and
Mariners won the game? is matched by the pattern

?[Ichiro(agent), hit]?, we select the former portion
of the sentence which exactly answers the user?s
query, and generate a response ?Ichiro hit a three-
run homer in the seventh inning.?
5 System Evaluation
We have implemented a spoken dialogue system
based on the significance measure (Naive Bayes
model) and the relevance measures, which were
learned using the Mainichi Newspaper corpus of ten
years (2000-2009). For evaluation of the system, we
prepared 201 questions from news articles (Septem-
ber 19-26, 2010) seen at the website of Mainichi
Newspaper2. Correct answers to the test queries
were annotated manually. Evaluation was done with
the text input as well as speech input. A word N-
gram language model for ASR dedicated to the do-
main was trained using the relevant newspaper arti-
cle corpus. The word error rate was approximately
24%.
The system responses for the test queries are cat-
egorized into one of the following four: correct an-
swer only (?Correct?), case which includes the cor-
rect answer but also other redundant answers (?Am-
biguous?), incorrect answer (?Incorrect?), and (?No
Answer?). The ambiguous cases occur when mul-
tiple sentences or predicates are matched. We also
calculate recall, precision and F-measure by count-
ing individual answers separately even when multi-
ple answers are output. The results based on these
evaluation measures are summarized in Table 2 and
Table 3 for text input and speech input.
In the tables, the proposed method is broken down
into three phases as shown in Fig. 4: exact match-
ing of P-A structure (Section 3), incorporation of
the partial matching (Section 4.1), and back-off to
the ?bag-of-words? (BOW) model (Section 4.4). For
comparison, we also tested the BOW model and

?sequence-of-words? (SOW) model, which consider
the sequence order in the BOW model. The exact
matching assumes strong constraint of P-A patterns,
so the generated answers are almost correct, but no
answers are generated very often. By incorporat-
ing the partial matching and BOW model, the sys-
tem can output more relevant answers. Compared
with the BOW model, the proposed method achieves
much higher ratio or precision of correct answers. F-
measure is also higher by 17% absolute.
A similar tendency is observed for speech input,
although the overall accuracy is degraded because
of the ASR errors. However, degradation is rela-
tively small considering the word accuracy of 76%.
The partial matching works effectively even if the
exact matching fails due to ASR errors. Moreover,
the back-off to the BOW model is effective in ASR
input.
The proposed method generates concise re-
sponses by selecting the relevant portion as de-
scribed in Section 4.5, while the BOW method of-
ten generates long responses which includes many
redundant portions. This property is particularly im-
portant in the speech interface.
We show a dialogue example in Fig. 5 which is
in Japanese and translated to English for reference
(=Italic).
6 Domain Portability
In the proposed scheme, we construct a domain-
dependent system in a pre-determined domain. It
is straightforward to port the system to other do-
mains just by preparing a domain corpus. This sys-
tem uses a newspaper corpus for training domain-
dependent statistical models. Newspaper articles are
classified according to domain categories such as
sports/baseball and business/finance. Therefore, it is
straightforward to select relevant articles for a par-
ticular domain. In the proposed scheme, we do not
need any further annotations and all statistical mod-
els are trained in an unsupervised manner.

7 Conclusions
We have presented a new scheme of spoken dialogue
systems which can talk about web texts in an in-
teractive manner. The information extraction tech-
nique is adopted to conduct question answering as
well as proactive information presentation. Filtering
based on a statistical significant measure is intro-
duced to automatically select useful templates in a
given domain. Relevance measures are also defined
for predicate and argument in order to retrieve rele-
vant entries when the exact matching does not suc-
ceed. In experimental evaluations, we have demon-
strated that the filtering works effectively and the
system generates more relevant responses than the
conventional method.
Ongoing works include application to other do-
mains to demonstrate generality of the scheme.
