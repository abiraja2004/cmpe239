Abstract
Entity sense disambiguation becomes dif-
ficult with few or even zero training in-
stances available, which is known as im-
balanced learning problem in machine
learning. To overcome the problem, we
create a new set of reliable training in-
stances from dictionary, called dictionary-
based prototypes. A hierarchical classifi-
cation system with a tree-like structure is
designed to learn from both the prototypes
and training instances, and three different
types of classifiers are employed. In addi-
tion, supervised dimensionality reduction
is conducted in a similarity-based space.
Experimental results show our system out-
performs three baseline systems by at least
8.3% as measured by macro F1 score.
1 Introduction
Ambiguities in terms and named entities are a
challenge for automatic information extraction
(IE) systems. The problem is particularly acute
for IE systems targeting the biomedical domain,
where unambigiously identifying terms is of fun-
damental importance. In biomedical text, a term
(or its abbreviation (Okazaki et al, 2010)) may
belong to a wide variety of semantic categories
(e.g., gene, disease, etc.). For example, ER may
denote protein estrogen receptor in one context,
but cell subunit endoplasmic reticulum in another,
not to mention it can also mean emergency room.
In addition, same terms (e.g., protein) may be-
long to many model organisms, due to the nomen-
clature of gene and gene products, where genes
in model organisms other than human are given,
whenever possible, the same names as their hu-
man orthologs (Wain et al, 2002). On the other
hand, public biological databases keep species-
specific records for the same protein or gene,
making species disambiguation an inevitable step
for assigning unique database identifiers to entity
names in text (Hakenberg et al, 2008; Krallinger
et al, 2008).
One way to entity disambiguation is classify-
ing an entity into pre-defined semantic categories,
based on its context (e.g., (Bunescu and Pas?ca,
2006)). Existing classifiers, such as maximum
entropy model, achieved satisfactory results on
the ?majority? classes with abundant training in-
stances, but failed on the ?minority? ones with few
or even zero training instances, i.e., the knowl-
edge acquisition bottleneck (Agirre and Martinez,
2004). Furthermore, it is often infeasible to cre-
ate enough training data for all existing semantic
classes. In addition, too many training instances
for certain majority classes lead to increased com-
putational complexity for training, and a biased
system ignoring the minority ones. These corre-
spond to two previously addressed difficulties in
imbalanced learning: ?... either (i) you have far
more data than your algorithms can deal with,
851
and you have to select a sample, or (ii) you have
no data at all and you have to go through an in-
volved process to create them? (Provost, 2000).
Given an entity disambiguation task with imbal-
anced data, this paper explores how to create more
informative training instances for minority classes
and how to improve the large-scale training for
majority classes.
Previous research has shown that words denot-
ing class information in the surrounding context of
an entity can be an informative indicator for dis-
ambiguation (Krallinger et al, 2008; Wang et al,
2010). Such words are refered to as ?cue words?
throughout this paper. For example, to disam-
biguate the type of an entity, that is, whether it
is a protein, gene, or RNA, looking at words such
as protein, gene and RNA are very helpful (Hatzi-
vassiloglou et al, 2001). Similarly, for the task
of species disambiguation (Wang et al, 2010),
the occurrence of mouse p53 strongly suggests
that p53 is a mouse protein. In many cases, cue
words are readily available in dictionaries. Thus,
for the minority classes, instead of creating arti-
ficial training instances by commonly used sam-
pling methods (Haibo and Garcia, 2009), we pro-
pose to create a new set of real training instances
by modelling cue words from a dictionary, called
dictionary-based prototypes. To learn from both
the original training instances and the dictionary-
based prototypes, a hierarchical classification sys-
tem with a tree-like structure is designed. Further-
more, to cope with the large number of features
representing each instance, supervised orthogo-
nal locality preserving projection (SOLPP) is con-
ducted for dimensionality reduction, by simulta-
neously preserving the intrinsic structures con-
structed from both the features and labels. A new
set of lower-dimensional embeddings with better
discriminating power is obtained and used as in-
put to the classifier. To cope with the large num-
ber of training instances in some majority classes,
we propose a committee machine scheme to ac-
celerate training speed without sacrificing classi-
fication accuracy. The proposed method is evalu-
ated on a species disambiguation task, and the em-
pirical results are encouraging, showing at least
8.3% improvement over three different baseline
systems.
2 Related Work
Construction of a classification model using su-
pervised learning algorithms is popular for entity
disambiguation. A number of researchers have
tackled entity disambiguation in general text us-
ing wikipedia as a resource to learn classifica-
tion models (Bunescu and Pas?ca, 2006). Hatzi-
vassiloglou et al (2001) studied disambiguating
proteins, genes, and RNA in text by training var-
ious classifiers using entities with class informa-
tion provided by adjacent cue words. Wang et
al. (2010) proposed a ?hybird? system for species
disambiguation, which heuristically combines re-
sults obtained from classifying the context, and
those from modeling relations between cue words
and entities. Although satisfactory performance
was reported, their system incurs higher computa-
tional cost due to syntactic parsing and the binary
relation classifier.
Many imbalanced learning techniques, as re-
viewed by Haibo and Garcia (2009), can also be
used to achieve the same purpose. However, to
our knowledge, there is little research in apply-
ing these machine learning (ML) techniques to en-
tity disambiguation. It is worth mentioning that
although these ML techniques can improve the
learning performance to some extent, they only
consider the information contained in the origi-
nal training instances. The created instances do
not add new information, but instead utilize the
original training information in a more sophisti-
cated way. This motivates us to pursue a differ-
ent method of creating new training instances by
using information from a related and easily ob-
tained source (e.g., a dictionary), similar to trans-
fer learning (Pan and Yang, 2009).
3 Task and Corpus
In this work, we develop an entity disambiguation
technique with the use of cue words, as well as a
general ML algorithm for imbalanced classifica-
tion using a set of newly created dictionary-based
prototypes. These prototypes are represented with
different features from those used by the original
training instances. The proposed method is eval-
uated on a species disambiguation task: given a
text, in which mentions of biomedical named en-
852
tities are annotated, we assign a species identi-
fier to every entity mention. The types of entities
studied in this work are genes and gene products
(e.g., proteins), and we use the NCBI Taxonomy1
(taxon) IDs as species tags and to build the proto-
types. Note that this paper focuses on the task of
species disambiguation and makes the assumption
that the named entities are already recognised.
Consider the following sentence as an exam-
ple: if one searches the proteins (i.e., the under-
lined term) in a protein database, he/she will find
they belong to many model organisms. However,
in this particular context, CD200R-CD4d3+4 is
human and mouse protein, while rCD4d3+4 is
a rat one.2 We call such a task of assigning
species identifiers to entities, according to context,
as species disambiguation.
The amounts of human and mouse
CD200R-CD4d3+4 and rCD4d3+4
protein on the microarray spots were
similar as visualized by the red fluo-
rescence of OX68 mAb recognising
the CD4 tag present in each of the
recombinant proteins.
The informative cue words (e.g., mouse) used
to help species disambiguation are called species
words. In this work, species words are defined as
any word that indicates a model organism and also
appears in the organism dictionaries we use. They
may have various parts-of-speech, and may also
contain multiple tokens (despite the name species
word). For example, ?human?, ?mice?, ?bovine?
and ?E. Coli? are all species words. We detect
these words by automatic dictionary lookup: a
word is annotated as a species word if it matches
an entry in a list of organism names. Each entry in
the list contains a species word and its correspond-
ing taxon ID, and the list is merged from two dic-
tionaries: the NCBI Taxonomy and the UniProt
controlled vocabulary of species.3 The NCBI por-
tion is a flattened NCBI Taxonomy (i.e., without
hierarchy) including only the identifiers of genus
and species ranks. In total, the merged list con-

omy
2Prefix ?r? in ?rCD4d3+4? indicates that it is a rat protein.
3http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/speclist
tains 356,387 unique species words and 272,991
unique species IDs. The ambiguity in species
words is low: 3.86% of species words map to mul-
tiple IDs, and on average each word maps to 1.043
IDs.
The proposed method was evaluated on the
corpus developed in (Wang et al, 2010), con-
taining 6, 223 genes and gene products, each of
which was manually assigned with either a taxon
ID or an ?Other? tag, with human being the
most frequent at 50.30%. With the extracted
features and the species ID tagged by domain
experts, each occurrence of named entities can
be represented as a d-dimensional vector with
a label. Species disambiguation can be mod-
elled as a multi-classification task: Given n train-
ing instances {xi}ni=1, their n ? d feature ma-
trix X = [xij ] and n-dimensional label vector
y = [y1, y2, . . . , yn]T are used to train a clas-
sifier C(?), where xi = [xi1, xi2, . . . , xid]T , yi ?
{1, 2, . . . , c}, and c denotes the number of ex-
isting species in total. Given m different query
instances {x?i}mi=1, their m ? d feature matrix
X? = [x?ij ] are used as the input to the trained
classifier, so that their labels can be predicted by
{C(x?i)}mi=1.
We used relatively simple contextual features
because this work was focused on developing a
ML framework. In more detail, we used the fol-
lowing features: 1) 200 words surrounding the en-
tity in question; 2) two nouns and two adjectives
at the entity?s left and right; 3) 5 species words
at the entity?s left and right. In addition, function
words and words that consist of only digits and
punctuations are filtered out. The final numeri-
cal dataset consists of 6,227 instances, each rep-
resented by 16,851 binary features and belonging
to one of the 13 classes. The dataset is highly im-
balanced: among the 13 classes, the numbers of
instances in the four majority classes vary from
449 to 3,220, while no more than 20 instances are
contained in the eight minority classes (see Table
1).

4 Proposed Method
4.1 Dictionary-based Prototypes
For each existing species, we create a b-
dimensional binary vector, given as pi =
[pi1, pi2, . . . , pib]T , using b different species
words listed in the dictionary as features, which
is called dictionary-based prototype. The binary
value pij denotes whether the jth species word
belongs to the ith species in the dictionary. This
leads to a c ? b feature matrix P = [pij ] for c
species.
Considering that the species words preceding
and appearing in the same sentence as an en-
tity can be informative indicators for the possible
species of this entity, we create two morem?b bi-
nary feature matrices for the query instances with
the same b species words as features: X?1 = [x?(1)ij ]
and X?2 = [x?(2)ij ], where x?(1)ij denotes whether the
jth species word is the preceding word of the ith
entity, and x?(2)ij denotes whether the jth species
word appears in the same sentence as the ith en-
tity but is not preceding word. Thus, the similar-
ity between each query entity and existing species
can be simply evaluated by calculating the inner-
product between the entity instance and the cor-
responding prototype. This leads to the following
m? c similarity matrix S? = [s?ij ]:
S? = ?X?1PT + (1? ?)X?2PT , (1)
where 0 ? ? ? 1 is a user-defined parameter con-
trolling the degree of indicating reliability of the
preceding word and the same-sentence word. The
n?c similarity matrix S = [sij ] between the train-
ing instances and the species can be constructed in
exactly the same way. Based on empirical expe-
rience, the preceding word indicates the entity?s
species more accurately than the same-sentence
word. Thus, ? is preferred to be set as greater
than 0.5. The obtained similarity matrix will be
used in the nearest neighbour classifier (see Sec-
tion 4.2.1).
Both the original training instances X and the
newly created prototypes P are used to train the
proposed hierarchical classification system. Sub-
ject to the nature of the classifier employed, it is
convenient to construct one single feature matrix

instead of using X and P individually. Aiming at
keeping the same similarity values between each
entity instance and the species prototype, we con-
struct the following (n+c)?(d+b) feature matrix
for both the training instances and prototypes:
F =
[ X ?X1 + (1? ?)X2
0 P
]
, (2)
where X1 and X2 are constructed in the same way
as X?1 and X?2 but for training instances. Their cor-
responding label vector is l = [yT , 1, 2, . . . , c]T .
4.2 Hierarchical Classification
Multi-stage or hierarchical classification (Giusti
et al, 2002; Podolak, 2007; Kurzyn?ski, 1988)
is widely used in many complex multi-category
classification tasks. Existing research shows such
techniques can potentially achieve right trade-off
between accuracy and resource allocation (Giusti
et al, 2002; Podolak, 2007). Our proposed hier-
archical system has a tree-like structure with three
different types of classifier at nodes (see Figure 1).
Different classes are organized in a hierarchical
order to be classified based on the corresponding
numbers of available training instances. Letting
ni denote the number of training instances avail-
able in the ithe class excluding the created proto-
types, we categorize the classes as follows:
? Minority Classes (MI): Classes with less
training instances than the threshold: MI =
{i : nin < ?1, i ? {1, 2 . . . , c}}.
854
? Majority Classes (MA): Classes with more
training instances than the threshold: MA =
{i : nin ? ?1, i ? {1, 2 . . . , c}}.
? Small-scale Majority Classes (SMA): Ma-
jority Classes with less training instances
than the threshold: SMA = {i : nin <
?2, i ? MA}.
? Large-scale Majority Classes (LMA): Ma-
jority Classes with more training instances
than the threshold: LMA = {i : nin ?
?2, i ? MA}.
Here, 0 < ?1 < 1 and 0 < ?2 < 1 are size
thresholds set by users. We have MI ?MA = ?,
SMA ? LMA = ?, and SMA ? LMA = MA.
The tree-like hierarchical structure of our sys-
tem is determined by MI, MA, SMA, and LMA.
We propose two IF-THEN rules to control the sys-
tem: Given a query instance x?i, the level 1 clas-
sifier C1 is used to predict whether x?i belongs to
MA or a specific class in MI, which wer call IF-
THEN rule 1 (IT1). If x?i belongs to MA, the level
2 classifier C2 is used to predict whether x?i be-
longs to LMA or a specific class in SMA, called
IF-THEN rule 2 (IT2). If x?i belongs to LMA, the
level 3 classifier C3 finally predicts the specific
class in LMA x?i belongs to. We explain in the
following sections how the classifiers C1, C2, and
C3 work in detail.
4.2.1 Nearest Neighbour Classifier
The goal of the nearest neighbour classifier, de-
noted by C1, is to decide whether the nearest-
neighbour prototype of the query instance be-
longs to MI. The only used training instances are
our created dictionary-based prototypes {pi}ci=1
with the label vector [1, 2, . . . , c]T . The nearest-
neighbour prototype of the query instance x?i pos-
sesses the maximum similarity to x?i:
NN(x?i) = arg maxj=1, 2, ..., c s?ij , (3)
where s?ij is obtained by Eq. (1). Consequently,
the output of the classifier C1 is given as
C1(x?i) =
{
NN(x?i), If NN(x?i) ? MI,
0, Otherwise.
(4)
The IF-THEN rule 1 can then be expressed as
Action(IT1) =
{ Go to C2, If C1(x?i) = 0,
Stop, Otherwise.
4.2.2 SOLPP-FLDA Classifier
The goal of the SOLPP-FLDA classifier, de-
noted by C2, is to predict whether the query in-
stance belongs to LMA or a specific class in SMA.
In this classifier, the used training instances are
the original training entities and the dictionary-
based prototypes, both belonging to MA. The fea-
ture matrix F and the label vector l defined in Sec-
tion 4.1 are used, but with instances from MI re-
moved (we use n? to denote the number of remain-
ing training instances, and the same symbol F for
feature matrix). The used label vector l? to train C2
should be re-defined as l?i = li if li ? SMA, and 0
otherwise.
First, we propose to implement orthog-
onal locality preserving projection (OLPP)
(Kokiopoulou and Saad, 2007) in a supervised
manner, leading to SOLPP, to obtain a smaller set
of more powerful features for classification. Also,
we conduct SOLPP in a similarity-based feature
space computed from (d + 2b) original features
by employing dot-product based similarity, given
by FFT . As explained later, to compute the
new features from FFT instead of the original
features F achieves reduced computational cost.
An n??k projection matrix V = [vij ] is optimized
in this n-dimensional similarity-based feature
space. The optimal projections are obtained by
minimizing the weighted distances between the
lower-dimensional embeddings so that ?similar?
instances are mapped together in the projected
feature space. Mathematically, this leads to the
following constrained optimization problem:
min
V?Rn??k,
VT V=Ik?k
tr[VTFTF(D?W)FFTV], (5)
where W = [wij ] denotes the n ? n weight ma-
trix with wij defining the degree of ?closeness? or
?similarity? between the ith and jth instances, D
is a diagonal matrix with {di =?n?j=1wij}n?i=1 as
the diagonal elements.
Usually, the weight matrix W is defined by
an adjacency graph constructed from the original
855
data, e.g. for OLPP. One common way to define
the adjacency is by including the K-nearest neigh-
bors (KNN) of a given node to its adjacency list,
which is also called the KNN-graph (Kokiopoulou
and Saad, 2007). There are two common ways to
define the weight matrix: constant value, where
wij = 1 if the ith and jth samples are adjacent,
while wij = 0 otherwise, and Gaussian kernel.
We will denote in the rest of the paper such a
weight matrix computed only from the features
as WX . Ideally, if the features can accurately
describe all the discriminating characteristics, the
samples that are close or similar enough to each
other should have the same label vectors. How-
ever, when processing real dataset, what may hap-
pen is that, in the d-dimensional feature space,
the data points that are close to each other may
belong to different categories, while on the con-
trary, the data points that are in a distant to each
other may belong to the same category. In the k-
dimensional projected feature space obtained by
OLPP, one may have the same problem. Because
OLPP solves the constrained optimization prob-
lem in Eq. (5) using WX : if two instances are
close or similar to each other in the original fea-
ture space, they will be the same close or simi-
lar to each other in the projected space. To solve
this problem, we decide to modify the ?closeness?
or ?similarity? between instances in the projected
feature space by considering the label informa-
tion. The following computation of a supervised
weight matrix is used for our SOLPP:
W = (1? ?)WX + ?LLT , (6)
where 0 ? ? ? 1 is a user-defined parameter
controlling the tradeoff between the label-based
and feature-based neighborhood structures, and
L = [lij ] is an n? ? c binary label matrix with
lij = 1 if the ith instance belongs to the jth class,
and lij = 0 otherwise.
The optimal solution of Eq. (5) is the top
(k + 1)th eigenvectors of the n? ? n? symmetric
matrix FTF(D ? W)FFT , corresponding to the
k + 1 smallest eigenvalues, but with the top one
eigenvector removed, denoted by V?. It is worth
to mention that if the original feature matrix F is
used as the input of SOLPP, one needs to com-
pute the eigen-decomposition of the (d + b) ?
(d+ b) symmetric matrix FT (D?W)F. The cor-
responding computation complexity increases in
O((d + b)3), which is unacceptable in practical
when d + b  n?. The projected features for the
training instances are computed by
Z = FFTV?. (7)
Given a different set of m query instances with an
m? (d+ b) feature matrix,
F? = [X?, ?X?1 + (1? ?)X?2], (8)
their embeddings can be easily obtained by
Z? = F?F?TV?. (9)
Then, the projected feature matrix Z and label
vector l? are used to train a multi-class classifier.
By employing the one-against-all scheme, differ-
ent binary classifiers {C(2)i }i?SMA?{0} with label
space {+1, ?1} are trained. For the ith class
(i ? SMA?{0}), the training instances belonging
to it are labeled as positive, otherwise negative. In
each binary classifier C(2)i , a separating function
f (2)i (x) = xTw
(2)
i + b
(2)
i (10)
is constructed, of which the optimal values of the
weight vector w(2)i and bias b(2)i are computed us-
ing Fisher?s linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)
(Fisher, 1936; Mu, 2008). Finally, the output of
the classifier C2 can be obtained by assigning the
most confident class label to the query instance x?i,
with the confidence value indicated by the value of
separating function:
C2(x?i) = arg max
j?SMA?{0}
f (2)j (x?i). (11)
The IF-THEN rule 2 can then be expressed as
Action(IT2) =
{ Go to C3, If C2(x?i) = 0,
Stop, Otherwise.
4.2.3 Committee Classifier
The goal of the committee classifier, denoted
by C3, is to predict the specific class in LMA
the query instance belongs to. The used training
856
instances are entities and dictionary-based proto-
types only belonging to LMA. With the same one-
against-all scheme, there are large number of pos-
itive and negative training instances to train a bi-
nary classifier for a class in LMA. To accelerate
the training procedure without sacrificing the ac-
curacy, the following scheme is designed.
Letting ne denote the number of experts in
committee, all the training instances are averagely
divided into ne+1 groups each containing similar
numbers of training instances from the same class.
The instances in the ith and the (i+1)th groups are
used to train the ith expert classifier. This achieves
overlapped training instances between expert clas-
sifiers. The output value of C(3)i is not the class in-
dex as used in C2, but the value of the separating
function of the most confident class, denoted by
f (3)i . Different from the commonly used majority
voting rule, we only trust the most confident ex-
pert. Thus, the output of C3 for a query instance
x?i can be obtained by
C3(x?i) = arg maxj=1, 2, ..., ne f
(3)
j (x?i). (12)
By using C3, different expert classifiers can be
trained in parallel. The total training time is equal
to that of the slowest expert classifier. The more
expert classifiers are used, the faster the system is,
however, the less accurate the system may become
due to the decrease of used training instances for
each expert, especially the positive instances in
the case of imbalanced classification. This is also
the reason we do not apply the committee scheme
to SMA classes.
5 Experiments
5.1 System Evaluation and Baseline
We evaluate the proposed method using 5-fold
cross validation, with around 4,980 instances for
training, and 1,245 instances for test in each trial.
We compute the F1 score for each species, and
employ macro- and micro- average scheme to
compute performance for all species. Three base-
lines for comparison include:
? Baseline 1 (B1) : A maximum entropy
model trained with training data only.
? Baseline 1 (B2) : Combination of B1 and
the species dictionary using rules employed
in Wang et al (2010).
? Baseline 2 (B3): The ?hybrid? system com-
bining B1, the dictionary and a relation
model 4 using rules (Wang et al, 2010).
Our hierarchical classification system were imple-
mented in two ways:
? HC: Only the training data on its own is used
to train the system.
? HC/D: Both the training data and the
dictionary-based prototypes are used to train
the system.
5.2 Results and Analysis
The proposed system was implemented with ? =
0.8, ? = 0.8, ne = 4, and k = 1000. The species
9606, 10090, 7227, and 4932 were categorized as
LMA, the species 10116 as SMA, and the rest sep-
cies as MI. To compute the supervised weight ma-
trix, the percentage of the used KNN in the KNN-
graph was 0.6. Parameters were not fine tuned, but
set based on our empirical experience on previous
classification research. As shown in Table 1: HC
and B1 were trained with the same instances and
features, and HC outperformed B1 in both macro
and micro F1. Both HC and B1 obtained zero F1
scores for most minority species, showing that it is
nearly impossible to correctly label the query in-
stances of minority classes, due to lack of training
data. By learning from a related resource, HC/D,
B2, and B3 yielded better macro performance. In
particular, while HC/D and B2 learned from the
same dictionary and training data, HC/D outper-
formed B2 by 19.1% in macro and 2.5% in mi-
cro F1. B3 aimed at improving the macro perfor-
mance by employing computationally expensive
syntactic parsers and also by training an extra re-
lation classifier. With the same goal, HC/D inte-
grated the cue word information into the ML clas-
sifier in a more general way, and yielded an 8.3%
improvement over B3, as measured by macro-F1.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
Disambiguating bio-entities presents a challenge
for traditional supervised learning methods, due
to the high number of semantic classes and lack of
training instances for some classes. We have pro-
posed a hierarchical framework for imbalanced
learning, and evaluated it on the species disam-
biguation task. Our method automatically builds
training instances for the minority or missing
classes from a cue word dictionary, under the as-
sumption that cue words in the surrounding con-
text of an entity strongly indicate its semantic cat-
egory. Compared with previous work (Wang
et al, 2010; Hatzivassiloglou et al, 2001), our
method provides a more general way to integrate
the cue word information into a ML framework
without using deep linguistic information.
Although the species disambiguation task is
specific to bio-text, the difficulties caused by im-
balanced frequency of different senses are com-
mon in real application of sense disambiguation.
The proposed technique can also be applied to
other domains, providing the availability of a cue
word dictionary that encodes semantic informa-
tion regarding the target semantic classes. Build-
ing such a dictionary from scratch can be chal-
lenging, but may be easier compared to manual
annotation. In addition, such dictionaries may al-
ready exist in specialised domains.
