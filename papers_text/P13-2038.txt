Abstract
Unsupervised object matching (UOM) is
a promising approach to cross-language
natural language processing such as bilin-
gual lexicon acquisition, parallel corpus
construction, and cross-language text cat-
egorization, because it does not require
labor-intensive linguistic resources. How-
ever, UOM only finds one-to-one corre-
spondences from data sets with the same
number of instances in source and target
domains, and this prevents us from ap-
plying UOM to real-world cross-language
natural language processing tasks. To al-
leviate these limitations, we proposes la-
tent semantic matching, which embeds
objects in both source and target lan-
guage domains into a shared latent topic
space. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on cross-language text cat-
egorization. The results show that our
method outperforms conventional unsu-
pervised object matching methods.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised object matching is a method for
finding one-to-one correspondences between ob-
jects across different domains without knowledge
about the relation between the domains. Kernel-
ized sorting (Novi et al, 2010) and canonical cor-
relation analysis based methods (Haghighi et al,
2008; Tripathi et al, 2010) are two such exam-
ples of unsupervised object matching, which have
been shown to be quite useful for cross-language
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One of
the most important properties of the unsupervised
object matching is that it does not require any lin-
guistic resources which connects between the lan-
guages. This distinguishes it from other cross-
language NLP methods such as machine transla-
tion based and projection based approaches (Du-
mais et al, 1996; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005;
Platt et al, 2010), which we need bilingual dictio-
naries or parallel sentences.
When we apply unsupervised object matching
methods to cross-language NLP tasks, there are
two critical problems. The first is that they only
find one-to-one matching. The second is they re-
quire the same size of source- and target-data. For
example, the correct translation of a word is not
always unique. French words ?maison?, ?appart-
ment? and ?domicile? can be regarded as transla-
tion of an English word ?home?. In addition, En-
glish vocabulary size is not equal to that of French.
These discussions motivate us to introduce a
shared space in which both source and target do-
main objects will reside. If we can obtain such
a shared space, we can match objects within the
space, because we can use standard distance met-
rics on this space. This will also enable us to use
various kinds of non-strict matching. For exam-
ple, k-nearest objects in the source domain will be
retrieved for a query object in the target domain.
In this paper, we propose a simple but effective
method to find the shared space by assuming that
two languages have common latent topics, which
we call latent semantic matching. With latent se-
mantic matching, we first find latent topics in two
domains independently. Then, the topics in two
domains are aligned by kernelized sorting, and ob-
jects are embedded in a shared latent topic space.
Latent topic representations are successfully used
in a wide range of NLP tasks, such as information
retrieval and text classification, because they rep-
resent intrinsic information of documents (Deer-
wester et al, 1990). By matching latent topics,
we can find relation between source and target do-
mains, and additionally we can handle different
numbers of objects in two domains.
We compared latent semantic matching with
conventional unsupervised object matching meth-
212
ods on the task of cross-language text categoriza-
tion, i.e. classifying target side unlabeled docu-
ments by label information obtained from source
side documents. The results show that, with more
source side documents, our method achieved the
highest classification accuracy.
2 Related work
Many cross-language text processing methods
have been proposed that require correspondences
between source and target languages. For exam-
ple, (Dumais et al, 1996) proposed cross-lingual
latent semantic indexing, and (Platt et al, 2010)
employed oriented principle component analysis
and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). They
concatenate the document pairs (source document
and its translation) obtained from a document-
level parallel corpus. They then apply multi-
variate analysis to acquire the translingual projec-
tion. There are extensions of latent Dirichlet alo-
cation (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003) for cross-language
analysis, such as multilingual topic models (Boyd-
Graber and Blei, 2009), joint LDA (Jagadeesh
and Daume III, 2010) and multilingual LDA (Xi-
aochuan et al, 2011). They require a bilingual dic-
tionary or document-level parallel corpora.
Unsupervised object matching methods have
been proposed recently (Novi et al, 2010;
Haghighi et al, 2008; Yamada and Sugiyama,
2011). These methods are promising in terms of
language portability because they do not require
external language resources. (Novi et al, 2010)
proposed kernelized sorting (KS); it finds one-to-
one correspondences between objects in different
domains by permuting a set to maximize the de-
pendence between two sets. Here, the Hilbert-
Schmidt independence criterion is used for mea-
suring dependence. (Djuric et al, 2012) proposed
convex kernelized sorting as an extension of KS.
(Yamada and Sugiyama, 2011) proposed least-
squares object matching which maximizes the
squared-loss mutual information between matched
pairs. (Haghighi et al, 2008) proposed another
framework, matching CCA (MCCA), based on a
probabilistic interpretation of CCA (Bach and Jor-
dan, 2005). MCCA simultaneously finds latent
variables that represent correspondences and la-
tent features so that the latent features of corre-
sponding examples exhibit the maximum correla-
tion. However, these unsupervised object match-
ing methods have limitations. They require that
the source and target domains have the same data
size, and they find one-to-one correspondences.
There are critical weaknesses of these methods
when we attempt to apply them to real world
cross-language NLP applications.
3 Latent Semantic Matching
We propose latent semantic matching to find a
shared latent space by assuming that two lan-
guages have common latent topics. Our method
consists of following four steps: (1) for both
source and target domains, we map the documents
to a K-dimensional latent topic space indepen-
dently, (2) we find the one-to-one correspondences
between topics across source and target domains
by unsupervised object matching, (3) we permute
topics of the target side according to the corre-
spondences, while fixing the topics of the source
side, and (4) finally, we map documents in the
source and target domains to a shared latent space
by using permuted and fixed topics.
3.1 Topic Extraction as Dimension Reduction
Suppose that we have N documents in the source
domain. sn=(sni)Ii=1 is the nth document rep-
resented as a multi-dimensional column vector in
the domain, i.e. each document is represented as
a bag-of-words vector. Here, each element of the
vectors indicates the TF?IDF score of the corre-
sponding word in the document. I is the size of the
feature set, i.e., the vocabulary size in the source
domain. Also, we have M documents in the tar-
get domain. tm=(tmj)Jj=1 is the mth document
represented as a multi-dimensional vector. J is
the vocabulary size in the target domain. Thus,
the data set in the source domain is represented by
an I ? N matrix, S=(s1, ? ? ? , sN ), the data set
in the target is represented by a J ? M matrix,
T=(t1, ? ? ? , tM ).
We factorize these matrices using nonnegative
matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 2000) to find
topics as follows:
S ?WSHS , (1)
T ?WTHT . (2)
WS is an I?K matrix that represents a set of top-
ics, i.e. each column vector denotes word weights
for each topic. HS is a K ? N matrix that de-
notes a set of latent semantic representations of
documents in the source domain, i.e. each row

?????? WS HS? * = 0 0 1 00 1 0 00 0 0 11 0 0 0
ment. I is the size of feature set, i.e., the size of vocabulary inthe source domain. Also, we have M documents in a targetdomain. tm = (tmj)Jj=1 is the m-th document representedas a multi-dimensional vector. J is the size of vocabulary inthe target domain. Thus, the data set in the source domain isrepresented as the I ?N matrix, S, the data set in the targetis represented as the J ?M matrix, T .Here, we assume that these matrices are approximated asthe product of low rank matrices as follows:
S ? WSHS , (1)T ? WTHT (2)WS is I?K matrix, which represents a set of topic propor-tions in the source domain, i.e., each column vector denotestopic proportion. HS is K ? N matrix, which denotes a setof documents in the K-dimensional latent space which cor-responds to the source domain, i.e., each row vector denotesthe document in the latent space. The k(1 ? k ? K)-th basisin the latent space corresponds to the k-th topic proportion.WT is I ? K matrix, which represents a set of topic pro-portions in the target domain. HT is K ? N matrix, whichdenotes a set of documents in the latent topic space with di-mentionaly K. K is less than I , J . In this paper, we employNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [Lee and Seung,2000] to factorize the original matrices.According to the factorization of the original matrices, wecan map the documents in the source and target domain tolatent topic space with dimentionaly K, independently.3.2 Finding Optimal Topic Alignments byUnsupervised Object MatchingTo connect the different latent space, the basis of the spacehave to be aligned each other. That is, topic proportion ex-tracted from the source language must be aligned that fromthe target language. This is reasonable consideration becausewe can assume the same latent concept for both language.For example, a topic proportion obtained from English docu-ments can be aligned a topic proportion obtained from Frenchdocuments. For all k and k?, k-th column vector in WS arealigned k?-th column vector in WT .However, we can not measure similarity between the topicproportions because we do not have any language resourcessuch as dictionary. Therefore, we utilize unsupervised ob-ject matching method to find one-to-one correspondences be-tween topic proportions. In this paper, we employ KernelizedSorting (KS) [Novi et al, 2010]. Of cource, we can replaceKS to another unsupervised object matching sush as MCCA[Haghighi et al, 2008], LSOM [Yamada and Sugiyama,2011].KS finds the best one-to-one matching by followings:
pi? = argmaxpi??K tr(G?SpiTG?Tpi),s.t. pi1K = 1K and piT1K = 1K . (3)pi is K?K matrix which represents one-to-one correspon-dence between topic proportion, i.e., piij = 1 indicates i-thtopic proportion in the source language corresponds to j-th
one of the target language. ? indicates set of all possibleK ? K matrices which store one-to-one corresponrence. GdenotesK?K kernel matrix obtained from topic proportion,Gij = K(WTi,:,W:,j), and G? is the centerd matrix of G. K(, )is a kernel function. 1K is K-dimensional column vector ofall ones. pi? is obtained by iterative procedure. According topi?, we can permutate the basis of the latent space obtainedfrom source language. See fig hoge.
S ? WSHS . (4)On the other hand, we can directly fomulate objective func-tion of unsupervised mapping. If the topic proportions arealigned each other, the correlation matrix (or gram matrix)obtained from source language is proportional to one fromtarget language:
||GS ? ?GT ||2 = 0. (5)? denotes the hyperparameter for tuning the socore range be-tween two gram matrices.By minimize the error of the matrix factorization (equa-tion (1),(2)) and the difference between correlation matrices(equation (6)), the objective function is defined as follow:
E = ?S ?WSHS?2+ ?T ?WTHT ?2+ ?||GS ? ?GT ||2. (6)
? is cost parameter between first, second argu-ment and third argument. The optimal parameters(WS,WT ,HS,HT ) are obtained by minimizing theobjective function. To mimimize the objective, gradient de-scend can be used. but However that is not convex function,we only obtained local optimal. Thefore, we employed abovetwo step procedure??????This objective function is not convex. That meanswe can only obtain local optimal parameters. By min-imizing equation (6), we can obtain a set of parameter(WS,WT ,HS,HT ) for unsupervised mapping. we couldbe employed gradient based algorithm but, as the first step,we employ former two step optimization procedure.3.3 Cross-lingual Text Categorization viaUnsupervised Mappingm-th document in the target domain (tm) is mapped to thesource domain as follows,
s(tm) = HT$:,mWS . (7)Here, HT :,m denotes the m-th column vector of HT , s(tm)is I dimentional vector.When each document in the source domain has a classlabel yn, we can train a classifier on the training data set{sn, yn}Nn=1. Therefore, the class label of the mapped docu-ment in the target domain s(tm) is assigned by the classifier.In the later experiments, we employ k(= 10)-NN as a classi-fier.WT HTMI NJ KKKTST

vector denotes an embedding of a document in the
K-dimensional latent space. Similarly, WT is an
I ?K matrix that represents a set of topics in the
target domain, and HT is a K ? M matrix that
denotes a set of latent semantic representations of
target documents. K is less than I and J .
By factorizing the original matrices, we can in-
dependently map the documents in the source and
target domains to the latent topic spaces whose di-
mensionality is K.
3.2 Finding Optimal Topic Alignments by
Unsupervised Object Matching
To connect the different latent spaces, topics ex-
tracted from the source language must be aligned
to one from the target language. This is reasonable
because we can assume that both languages share
the same latent concept.
However, we cannot quantify the similarity be-
tween the topics because we do not have any ex-
ternal language resources such as a dictionary.
Therefore, we utilize unsupervised object match-
ing method to find one-to-one correspondences
between topics. In this paper, we employ kernel-
ized sorting (KS) (Novi et al, 2010). KS finds the
best one-to-one matching as follows:
pi? = argmax
pi??K
tr(GSpi?GTpi),
s.t. pi1K=1K and pi?1K=1K . (3)
Here, pi is a K?K matrix that represents the one-
to-one correspondence between topics, i.e. piij=1
indicates that the ith topic in the source language
corresponds to the jth one of the target language.

KS 0.252 ? 0.112
CKS 0.249 ? 0.033
LSOM 0.278 ? 0.086
LSM(300) 0.298 ? 0.077
LSM(600) 0.359 ? 0.062
Table 1: Average accuracy over all language pairs
?K indicates the set of all possible matrices stor-
ing one-to-one correspondences. G denotes the
K ? K kernel matrix obtained from topic pro-
portion, Gij=K(W?i,: ,W:,j), and G is the centered
matrix of G. K(, ) is a kernel function. 1K is a
K-dimensional column vector of all ones. pi? is
obtained by iterative procedure.
According to pi?, we obtain permuted matrices,
WT=WTpi? and HT=pi??HT , and the product
of permuted matrices is the same with that of un-
permuted matrices as follows:
T ?WTHT=WTHT . (4)
Fig. 1 shows the topic alignment procedure.
Since documents from both domains are repre-
sented in a shared latent space, we can directly cal-
culate the similarity between the nth document in
the source domain and the mth document in the
target domain based on HT :,m (mth column vec-
tor of HT ) and HS:,n (nth column vector of HS).
4 Cross-language Text Categorization
via Latent Semantic Matching
Cross-language text categorization is the task of
exploiting labeled documents in the source lan-
guage (e.g. English) to classify documents in
the target language (e.g. French). Suppose we
have training data set {sn, yn}Nn=1 in the source
language domain. yn ? Y is the class label
for the nth document. We can train a classifier
in the K-dimensional latent space with data set
{H?S:,n, yn}Nn=1. H?S:,n is the projected vector of
sn. Also, the mth document in the target language
domain tm is projected into the latent space as
H?T :,m. Here, the documents in both domains are
projected into the same size latent space and the
basis vectors of the spaces are aligned. Therefore,
we can classify a document in the target domain
tm by a classifier trained with {H?S:,n, yn}Nn=1.

5 Experimental Evaluation
5.1 Experimental Settings
We compared our method, latent semantic match-
ing (LSM), with three unsupervised object match-
ing methods: Kernelized Sorting (KS), Convex
Kernelized Sorting (CKS), Least-Squares Object
Matching (LSOM). We set the number of the la-
tent topics K to 100 and employed the k-nearest
neighbor method (k=10) as the classifier.
For, KS, CKS and LSOM, we find the one-
to-one correspondence between documents in the
source language and documents in the target lan-
guage. Then, we assign class labels of the target
documents according to the correspondence.
In order to build a corpus with various lan-
guage pairs for evaluation, we crawled product
reviews from Amazon U.S., German, France and
Japan with five categories: ?Books?, ?Electronics?,
?Music?, ?Kitchen?, ?Watch?. The corpus is nei-
ther sentence level parallel nor comparable. For
each category, we randomly select 60 documents
as the test data (M=300) for all methods and 60
documents as the training data (N=300) for KS,
CKS, LSOM and LSM(300). We also compared
latent semantic matching with 120 training docu-
ments for each category (N=600), and called this
method LSM(600). Note that since KS, CKS and
LSOM require that the data sizes are the same for
source and target domains, they cannot use train-
ing data more than test data. To avoid local opti-
mum solutions of NMF, we executed our methods
with 100 different initialization values and chose
the solution that achieved the best objective func-
tion of KS.
5.2 Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows average accuracies with standard
division over all language pairs. From the table,
classification accuracy of all methods significantly
outperformed random classifier (accuracy=0.2).
The results showed the effectiveness of both un-
supervised object matching and latent semantic
matching. When comparing LSM(300) with KS,
CKS and LSOM, LSM(300) obtained better re-
sults than these unsupervised object matching
methods. The result supports the effectiveness of
the latent topic matching. Moreover, LSM(600)
achieved the highest accuracy. There are large dif-
ferences between LSM(600) and the others. This
result implies not only the effectiveness of the la-
tent topic matching but also increasing the number
of source side documents (labeled training data)
contributes to improving classification accuracy.
This is natural in terms of supervised learning but
only our method can deal with source side docu-
ments that are larger in number.
Table 2 shows examples of latent topics in
English and German extracted and aligned by
LSM(600). We can see that some author names,
words related to camera, and cooking equipment
appear in ?Books?, ?Electronics? and ?Kitchen?
topics, respectively. Similarity, there are some
artists? names in ?Music? and watch brands in
?Watch?.

6 Conclusion
As an extension of unsupervised object matching,
this paper proposed latent semantic matching that
considers the shared latent space between two lan-
guage domains. To generate such a space, top-
ics of the target space are permuted by exploit-
ing unsupervised object matching. We can mea-
sure distances between objects by standard met-
rics, which enable us retrieving k-nearest objects
in the source domain for a query object in the tar-
get domain. This is a significant advantage over
conventional unsupervised object matching meth-
ods. We used Amazon review corpus to demon-
strate the effectiveness of our method on cross-
language text categorization. The results showed
that our method outperformed conventional object
matching methods with the same number of train-
ing samples. Moreover, our method achieved even
higher performance by utilizing more documents
in the source domain.
