Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of summa-
rizing decisions in spoken meetings: our goal
is to produce a concise decision abstract for
each meeting decision. We explore and com-
pare token-level and dialogue act-level au-
tomatic summarization methods using both
unsupervised and supervised learning frame-
works. In the supervised summarization set-
ting, and given true clusterings of decision-
related utterances, we find that token-level
summaries that employ discourse context can
approach an upper bound for decision ab-
stracts derived directly from dialogue acts.
In the unsupervised summarization setting,we
find that summaries based on unsupervised
partitioning of decision-related utterances per-
form comparably to those based on partitions
generated using supervised techniques (0.22
ROUGE-F1 using LDA-based topic models
vs. 0.23 using SVMs).
1 Introduction
Meetings are a common way for people to share in-
formation and discuss problems. And an effective
meeting always leads to concrete decisions. As a re-
sult, it would be useful to develop automatic meth-
ods that summarize not the entire meeting dialogue,
but just the important decisions made. In particular,
decision summaries would allow participants to re-
view decisions from previous meetings as they pre-
pare for an upcoming meeting. For those who did
not participate in the earlier meetings, decision sum-
maries might provide one type of efficient overview
of the meeting contents. For managers, decision
summaries could act as a concise record of the idea
generation process.
While there has been some previous work in
summarizing meetings and conversations, very lit-
tle work has focused on decision summarization:
Ferna?ndez et al (2008a) and Bui et al (2009) in-
vestigate the use of a semantic parser and machine
learning methods for phrase- and token-level deci-
sion summarization. We believe our work is the first
to explore and compare token-level and dialogue
act-level approaches ? using both unsupervised and
supervised learning methods ? for summarizing de-
cisions in meetings.

Decision Abstracts (Summary)
DECISION 1: The remote will have an LCD and spinning
wheel inside.
DECISION 2: The case will be flat on top and curved on
the bottom.
DECISION 3: The remote control and its buttons will be
made of rubber.
DECISION 4: The remote will resemble a vegetable and
be in bright vegetable colors.
Table 1: A clip of a meeting from the AMI meeting cor-
pus (Carletta et al, 2005). A, B, C and D refer to distinct
speakers; the numbers in parentheses indicate the asso-
ciated meeting decision: DECISION 1, 2, 3 or 4. Also
shown is the gold-standard (manual) abstract (summary)
for each decision.

Consider the sample dialogue snippet in Table 1,
which is part of the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta et
al., 2005). The Table lists only decision-related di-
alogue acts (DRDAs) ? utterances associated with
at least one decision made in the meeting.1 The DR-
DAs are ordered by time; intervening utterances are
not shown. DRDAs are important because they con-
tain critical information for decision summary con-
struction.
Table 1 clearly shows some challenges for deci-
sion summarization for spoken meetings beyond the
disfluencies, high word error rates, absence of punc-
tuation, interruptions and hesitations due to speech.
First, different decisions can be discussed more or
less concurrently; as a result, the utterances asso-
ciated with a single decision are not contiguous in
the dialogue. In Table 1, the dialogue acts (hence-
forth, DAs) concerning DECISION 1, for exam-
ple, are interleaved with DAs for other decisions.
Second, some decision-related DAs contribute more
than others to the associated decision. In compos-
ing the summary for DECISION 1, for example, we
might safely ignore the first DA for DECISION 1. Fi-
nally, more so than for standard text summarization,
purely extract-based summaries are not likely to be
easily interpretable: DRDAs often contain text that
is irrelevant to the decision and many will only be
understandable if analyzed in the context of the sur-
rounding utterances.
In this paper, we study methods for decision sum-
marization for spoken meetings. We assume that
all decision-related DAs have been identified and
aim to produce a summary for the meeting in the
form of concise decision abstracts (see Table 1), one
for each decision made. In response to the chal-
lenges described above, we propose a summariza-
tion framework that includes:
Clustering of decision-related DAs. Here we aim to
partition the decision-related utterances (DRDAs)
according to the decisions each supports. This step
is similar in spirit to many standard text summariza-
tion techniques (Salton et al, 1997) that begin by
grouping sentences according to semantic similar-
ity.
Summarization at the DA-level. We select just the im-
portant DRDAs in each cluster. Our goal is to elimi-
nate redundant and less informative utterances. The
1These are similar, but not completely equivalent, to the de-
cision dialogue acts (DDAs) of Bui et al (2009), Ferna?ndez et
al. (2008a), Frampton et al (2009). The latter refer to all DAs
that appear in a decision discussion even if they do NOT support
any particular decision.
selected DRDAs are then concatenated to form the
decision summary.
Optional token-level summarization of the selected
DRDAs. Methods are employed to capture con-
cisely the gist of each decision, discarding any
distracting text.
Incorporation of the discourse context as needed.
We hypothesize that this will produce more
interpretable summaries.
More specifically, we compare both unsupervised
(TFIDF (Salton et al, 1997) and LDA topic mod-
eling (Blei et al, 2003)) and (pairwise) supervised
clustering procedures (using SVMs and MaxEnt) for
partitioning DRDAs according to the decision each
supports. We also investigate unsupervised methods
and supervised learning for decision summarization
at both the DA and token level, with and without the
incorporation of discourse context. During training,
the supervised decision summarizers are told which
DRDAs for each decision are the most informative
for constructing the decision abstract.
Our experiments employ the aforementioned
AMI meeting corpus: we compare our decision
summaries to the manually generated decision ab-
stracts for each meeting and evaluate performance
using the ROUGE-1 (Lin and Hovy, 2003) text sum-
marization evaluation metric.
In the supervised summarization setting, our ex-
periments demonstrate that with true clusterings of
decision-related DAs, token-level summaries that
employ limited discourse context can approach an
upper bound for summaries extracted directly from
DRDAs2 ? 0.4387 ROUGE-F1 vs. 0.5333. When
using system-generated DRDA clusterings, the DA-
level summaries always dominate token-level meth-
ods in terms of performance.
For the unsupervised summarization setting, we
investigate the use of both unsupervised and su-
pervised methods for the initial DRDA clustering
step. We find that summaries based on unsupervised
clusterings perform comparably to those generated
using supervised techniques (0.2214 ROUGE-F1
using LDA-based topic models vs. 0.2349 using
SVMs). As in the supervised summarization setting,
we observe that including additional discourse con-
text boosts performance only for token-level sum-
maries.
2The upper bound measures the vocabulary overlap of each
gold-standard decision summary with the complete text of all of
its associated DRDAs.

2 Related Work
There exists much previous research on automatic
text summarization using corpus-based, knowledge-
based or statistical methods (Mani, 1999; Marcu,
2000). Dialogue summarization methods, how-
ever, generally try to account for the special char-
acteristics of speech. Among early work in
this subarea, Zechner (2002) investigates speech
summarization based on maximal marginal rele-
vance (MMR) and cross-speaker linking of infor-
mation. Popular supervised methods for summa-
rizing speech ? including maximum entropy, con-
ditional random fields (CRFs), and support vector
machines (SVMs) ? are investigated in Buist et al
(2004), Xie et al (2008) and Galley (2006). Tech-
niques for determining semantic similarity are used
for selecting relevant utterances in Gurevych and
Strube (2004).
Studies in Banerjee et al (2005) show that de-
cisions are considered to be one of the most im-
portant outputs of meetings. And in recent years,
there has been much research on detecting decision-
related DAs. Hsueh and Moore (2008), for exam-
ple, propose maximum entropy classification tech-
niques to identify DRDAs in meetings; Ferna?ndez
et al (2008b) develop a model of decision-making
dialogue structure and detect decision DAs based on
it; and Frampton et al (2009) implement a real-time
decision detection system.
Ferna?ndez et al (2008a) and Bui et al (2009),
however, might be the most relevant previous work
to ours. The systems in both papers run an open-
domain semantic parser on meeting transcriptions
to produce multiple short fragments, and then em-
ploy machine learning methods to select the phrases
or words that comprise the decision summary. Al-
though their task is also decision summarization,
their gold-standard summaries consist of manually
annotated words from the meeting while we judge
performance using manually constructed decision
abstracts as the gold standard. The latter are more
readable, but often use a vocabulary different from
that of the associated decision-related utterances in
the meeting.
Our work differs from all of the above in that we
(1) incorporate a clustering step to partition DRDAs
according to the decision each supports; (2) generate
decision summaries at both the DA- and token-level;
and (3) investigate the role of discourse context for
decision summarization.
In the following sections, we investigate methods
for clustering DRDAs (Section 3) and generating
DA-level and token-level decision summaries (Sec-
tion 4). In each case, we evaluate the methods using
the AMI meeting corpus.
3 Clustering Decision-Related Dialogue
Acts
We design a preprocessing step that facilitates deci-
sion summarization by clustering all of the decision-
related dialogue acts according to the decision(s) it
supports. Because it is not clear how many deci-
sions are made in a meeting, we use a hierarchi-
cal agglomerative clustering algorithm (rather than
techniques that require a priori knowledge of the
number of clusters) and choose the proper stopping
conditions. In particular, we employ average-link
methods: at each iteration, we merge the two clus-
ters with the maximum average pairwise similarity
among their DRDAs. In the following subsections,
we introduce unsupervised and supervised methods
for measuring the pairwise DRDA similarity.
3.1 DRDA Similarity: Unsupervised Methods
We consider two unsupervised similarity measures
? one based on the TF-IDF score from the Infor-
mation Retrieval research community, and a second
based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models.
TF-IDF similarity. TF-IDF similarity metrics
have worked well as a measure of document simi-
larity. As a result, we employ it as one metric for
measuring the similarity of two DRDAs. Suppose
there are L distinct word types in the corpus. We
treat each decision-related dialgue act DAi as a
document, and represent it as an L-dimensional
feature vector
???
FVi = (xi1, xi2, ..., xiL), where xik
is word wk?s tf ? idf score for DAi. Then the
(average-link) similarity of cluster Cm and cluster
Cn, Sim TFIDF (Cm, Cn), is defined as :
1
| Cm | ? | Cn |
?
DAi?Cm
DAj?Cn
???
FVi ?
???
FVj
?
???
FVi ??
???
FVj ?
LDA topic models. In recent years, topic models
have become a popular technique for discovering the
latent structure of ?topics? or ?concepts? in a cor-
pus. Here we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) topic models of Blei et al (2003) ? unsuper-

vised probabilistic generative models that estimate
the properties of multinomial observations. In our
setting, LDA-based topic models provide a soft clus-
tering of the DRDAs according to the topics they
discuss.3 To determine the similarity of two DR-
DAs, we effectively measure the similarity of their
term-based topic distributions.
To train an LDA-based topic model for our task4,
we treat each DRDA as an individual document.
After training, each DRDA, DAi, is assigned a
topic distribution
??
?i according to the learned model.
Thus, we can define the similarity of cluster Cm and
cluster Cn, Sim LDA(Cm, Cn), as :
1
| Cm | ? | Cn |
?
DAi?Cm
DAj?Cn
??
?i ?
??
?j
3.2 DRDA Similarity: Supervised Techniques
In addition to unsupervised methods for clustering
DRDAs, we also explore an approach based on Pair-
wise Supervised Learning: we develop a classifier
that determines whether or not a pair of DRDAs sup-
ports the same decision. So each training and test
example is a feature vector that is a function of two
DRDAs: for DAi and DAj , the feature vector is
???
FVij = f(DAi, DAj) = {fv1ij , fv
2
ij , ..., fv
k
ij}. Ta-
ble 2 gives a full list of features that are used. Be-
cause the annotations for the time information and
dialogue type of DAs are available from the cor-
pus, we employ features including time difference
of pairwise DAs, relative position5 and whether they
3We cannot easily associate each topic with a decision be-
cause the number of decisions is not known a priori.
4Parameter estimation and inference done by GibbsLDA++.
5Here is the definition for the relative position of pairwise
DAs. Suppose there are N DAs in one meeting ordered by time,
have the same DA type.
We employ Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) as our learning
methods, because SVMs are shown to be effective
in text categorization (Joachims, 1998) and Max-
Ent has been applied in many natural language
processing tasks (Berger et al, 1996). Given an
???
FVij , for SVMs, we utilize the decision value of
wT ?
???
FVij + b as the similarity, where w is the
weight vector and b is the bias. For MaxEnt, we
make use of the probability of P (SameDecision |
???
FVij) as the similarity value.
3.3 Experiments
Corpus. We use the AMI meeting Corpus (Car-
letta et al, 2005), a freely available corpus of multi-
party meetings that contains a wide range of anno-
tations. The 129 scenario-driven meetings involve
four participants playing different roles on a de-
sign team. A short (usually one-sentence) abstract
is included that describes each decision, action, or
problem discussed in the meeting; and each DA is
linked to the abstracts it supports. We use the manu-
ally constructed decision abstracts as gold-standard
summaries and assume that all decision-related DAs
have been identified (but not linked to the decision(s)
it supports).
Baselines. Two clustering baselines are utilized
for comparison. One baseline places all decision-
related DAs for the meeting into a single partition
(ALLINONEGROUP). The second uses the text seg-
mentation software of Choi (2000) to partition the
decision-related DAs (ordered according to time)
into several topic-based groups (CHOISEGMENT).
Experimental Setup and Evaluation. Results for
pairwise supervised clustering were obtained using
3-fold cross-validation. In the current work, stop-
ping conditions for hierarchical agglomerative clus-
tering are selected manually: For the TF-IDF and
topic model approaches, we stop when the similar-
ity measure reaches 0.035 and 0.015, respectively;
For the SVM and MaxEnt versions, we use 0 and
0.45, respectively. We use the Mallet implementa-
tion for MaxEnt and the SVMlight implementation
of SVMs.
Our evaluation metrics include b3 (also called B-
cubed) (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), which is a com-
DAi is the ith DA and DAj is positioned at j. So the relative
position of DAi and DAj is
|i?j|

resolution research; a pairwise scorer that measures
correctness for every pair of DRDAs; and a variation
of information (VOI) scorer (Meila?, 2007), which
measures the difference between the distributions of
the true clustering and system generated clustering.
As space is limited, we refer the readers to the orig-
inal papers for more details. For b3 scorer and pair-
wise scorer, higher results represent better perfor-
mance; for VOI, lower is better.6
Results. The results in Table 3 show first that all
of the proposed clustering methods outperform the
baselines. Among the unsupervised methods, the
LDA topic modeling is preferred to TFIDF. For the
supervised methods, SVMs and MaxEnt produce
comparable results.
4 Decision Summarization
In this section, we turn to decision summarization ?
extracting a short description of each decision based
on the decision-related DAs in each cluster. We in-
vestigate options for constructing an extract-based
summary that consists of a single DRDA and an
abstract-based summary comprised of keywords that
describe the decision. For both types of summary,
we employ standard techniques from text summa-
rization, but also explore the use of dialogue-specific
features and the use of discourse context.
4.1 DA-Level Summarization Based on Unsu-
pervised Methods
We make use of two unsupervised methods to sum-
marize the DRDAs in each ?decision cluster?. The
first method simply returns the longest DRDA in the

is flawed in measuring the singleton clusters which is prevalent
in the AMI corpus. So we do not use it in this work.

cluster as the summary (LONGEST DA). The sec-
ond approach returns the decision cluster prototype,
i.e., the DRDA with the largest TF-IDF similar-
ity with the cluster centroid (PROTOTYPE DA). Al-
though important decision-related information may
be spread over multiple DRDAs, both unsupervised
methods allow us to determine summary quality
when summaries are restricted to a single utterance.
4.2 DA-Level and Token-Level Summarization
Using Supervised Learning
Because the AMI corpus contains a decision abstract
for each decision made in the meeting, we can use
this supervisory information to train classifiers that
can identify informative DRDAs (for DA-level sum-
maries) or informative tokens (for token-level sum-
maries).

Dialogue Act-based Summarization. Previous
research (e.g., Murray et al (2005), Galley
(2006), Gurevych and Strube (2004)) has shown
that DRDA-level extractive summarization can be
effective when viewed as a binary classification task.
To implement this approach, we assume that the
DRDA to be extracted for the summary is the one
with the largest vocabulary overlap with the cluster?s
gold-standard decision abstract. This DA-level sum-
marization method has an advantage that the sum-
mary maintains good readability without a natural
language generation component.
Token-based Summarization. As shown in Table
1, some decision-related DAs contain many useless
words when compared with the gold-standard ab-
stracts. As a result, we propose a method for token-
level decision summarization that focuses on iden-
tifying critical keywords from the cluster?s DRDAs.
We follow the method of Ferna?ndez et al (2008a),
but use a larger set of features and different learning
methods.
Adding Discourse Context. For each of the su-
pervised DA- and token-based summarization meth-
ods, we also investigate the role of the discourse
context. Specifically, we augment the DRDA clus-
terings with additional (not decision-related) DAs
from the meeting dialogue: for each decision par-
tition, we include the DA with the highest TF-IDF
similarity with the centroid of the partition. We
will investigate the possible effects of this additional
context on summary quality.
In the next subsection, we describe the features
used for supervised learning of DA- and token-based
decision summaries.
4.3 Dialogue Cues for Decision Summarization
Different from text, dialogues have some notable
features that we expect to be useful for finding in-
formative, decision-related utterances. This section
describes some of the dialogue-based features em-
ployed in our classifiers. The full lists of features
are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.
Structural Information: Adjacency Pairs. An
Adjacency Pair (AP) is an important conversational
analysis concept; APs are considered the fundamen-
tal unit of conversational organization (Schegloff
and Sacks, 1973). In the AMI corpus, an AP pair
consists of a source utterance and a target utterance,
produced by different speakers. The source pre-
cedes the target but they are not necessarily adja-
cent. We include features to indicate whether or not
two DAs are APs indicating QUESTION+ANSWER
or POSITIVE FEEDBACK. For these features, we use
the gold-standard AP annotations. We also include
one feature that checks membership in a small set
of words to decide whether a DA contains positive
feedback (e.g., ?yeah?, ?yes?).
Discourse Information: Review and Closing In-
dicator. Another pragmatic cue for dialogue dis-
cussion is terms like ?wrap up? or ?recap?, indicat-
ing that speakers will review the key meeting con-
tent. We include the distance between these indica-
tors and DAs as a feature.
Grammatical Information: Dependency Relation
Between Words. For token-level summarization,
we make use of the grammatical relationships in
the DAs. As in Bui et al (2009) and Ferna?ndez

basic predicate-argument structures involving major
phrase types (S, VP, NP, and PP) and (b) additional
typed dependencies from Marneffe et al (2006). We
use the Stanford Parser.
5 Experiments
Experiments based on supervised learning are per-
formed using 3-fold cross-validation. We train two
different types of classifiers for identifying infor-
mative DAs or tokens: Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) (via Mallet) and Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) (via SVMlight).
We remove function words from DAs before us-
ing them as the input of our systems. The AMI deci-
sion abstracts are the gold-standard summaries. We
use the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) evaluation
measure. ROUGE is a recall-based method that can
identify systems producing succinct and descriptive
summaries.7

vised and supervised summarization methods are

sults only using the best unsupervised (USING LDA)
and supervised (USING SVMS) DRDA clustering
techniques.
Both Table 6 and 7 show that some attempt to
cluster DRDAs improves the summarization results
vs. NO CLUSTERING. In Table 6, there is no signif-
icant difference between the results obtained from
the LONGEST DA and PROTOTYPE DA for any ex-
periment setting. This is because the longest DA is
often selected as the prototype. An UPPER BOUND
result is listed for comparison: for each decision
cluster, this system selects all words from the DR-
DAs that are part of the decision abstract (discarding
duplicates).
Table 7 presents the results for supervised sum-
marization. Rows starting with DA or TOKEN indi-
cate results at the DA- or token-level. The +CON-
TEXT rows show results when discourse context is
included.8 We see that: (1) SVMs have a superior or
comparable summarization performance vs. CRFs
on every task. (2) Token-level summaries perform
better than DA-level summaries only using TRUE
CLUSTERINGS and the SVM-based summarizer. (3)
Discourse context generally improves token-level
summaries but not DA-level summaries.9 (4) DRDA

experiments where we tried this were unsuccessful.

clusterings produced by (unsupervised) LDA lead to
summaries that are quite comparable in quality to
those generated from DRDA clusterings produced
by SVMs (supervised). From Table 6, we see that
F1 is 0.2214 when choosing longest DAs from LDA-
generated clusterings, which is comparable with the
F1s of 0.1935 and 0.2349, attained when employing
CRF and SVMs on the same clusterings.
The results in Table 7 are achieved by compar-
ing abstracts having function words with system-
generated summaries without function words. To re-
duce the vocabulary difference as much as possible,
we also ran experiments that remove function words
from the gold-standard abstracts, but no significant
difference is observed.10
Finally, we considered comparing our systems to
the earlier similar work of (Ferna?ndez et al, 2008a)
and (Bui et al, 2009), but found that it would
be quite difficult because they employ a different
notion from DRDAs which is Decision Dialogue
Acts(DDAs). In addition, they manually annotate
words from their DDAs as the gold-standard sum-
mary, guaranteeing that their decision summaries
employ the same vocabulary as the DDAs. We in-
stead use the actual decision abstracts from the AMI
corpus.
5.1 Sample Decision Summaries
Here we show sample summaries produced using
our methods (Table 8). We pick one of the clus-
terings generated by LDA consisting of four DAs
which support two decisions and take SVMs as
the supervised summarization method. We remove
function words and special markers like ?[disf-
marker]? from the DAs.
The outputs indicate that either the longest DA or
prototype DA contains part of the decisions in this
?mixed? cluster. Adding discourse context refines
the summaries at both the DA- and token-levels.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we explore methods for producing de-
cision summaries from spoken meetings at both the
DA-level and the token-level. We show that clus-
10Given abstracts without function words, and using the clus-
terings generated by LDA and employ CRF on DA- and token-
level summarization, we get F1s of 0.1954 and 0.1329, which
is marginally better than the corresponding 0.1935 and 0.1307
in Table 7. Similarly, if SVMs are employed in the same cases,
we get F1s of 0.2367 and 0.1861 instead of 0.2349 and 0.1843.
All of the other results obtain negligible minor increases in F1.
DA (1): um of course , as [disfmarker] we , we?ve already
talked about the personal face plates in this meeting , (a)

the casings rubber . (b)
Decision (a): Will use personal face plates.
Decision (b): Case will be plastic and coated in rubber.

tering DRDAs before identifying informative con-
tent to extract can improve summarization quality.
We also find that unsupervised clustering of DR-
DAs (using LDA-based topic models) can produce
summaries of comparable quality to those gener-
ated from supervised DRDA clustering. Token-level
summarization methods can be boosted by adding
discourse context and outperform DA-level summa-
rization when true DRDA clusterings are available;
otherwise, DA-level summarization methods offer
better performance.
