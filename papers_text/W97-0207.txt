Abst ract  
Semantic entropy is a measure of se- 
mantic -mbigu i ty  and uninformat ive-  
hess. It is a graded lexical feature 
which may play a role anywhere lex- 
ical semantics plays a role. This pa- 
per  presents a method for measur ing 
semantic entropy using translat ional 
distributions of words in parallel text 
corpora. The measurement  method 
is well-defined for all words, including 
funct ion words, and even for punctu-  
ation. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Semantic entropy is a measure of semantic ambi- 
gnity and uninformativeness. This paper presents a
method for measuring semantic entropy using trans- 
lational distributions of words in parallel text cor- 
pora. The measurement method is well-defined for 
all words, including function words, and even for 
punctuation. The hypothesis behind the measure- 
ment method is that semantically heavy words are 
more likely to have unique counterparts in other lan- 
guages, so they tend to be translated more consis- 
tently than semantically ighter words. The consis- 
tency with which words are translated can be calcu- 
lated from the translational distributions of words 
in parallel texts in two languages (bitexts). The 
translational distributions can be estimated using 
any reasonably good word translation model, such as 
those described in (BD+93; Che96) or in (Me196b). 
Semantic entropy is a graded lexical feature which 
may play a role anywhere lexical semantics plays a 
role. For example, semantic entropy can be inter- 
preted as semantic ambiguity. On this interpreta- 
tion, it can predict the difficulty of disambiguating 
the sense of a given word. Brown et al (BD+91) 
present a word-sense disambiguation algorithm in- 
volving minimization of semantic entropy weighted 
by word frequency. Yarowsky (Yar93) compares the 
semantic entropy of homographs conditioned on dif- 
ferent contexts. Another way to use semantic en- 
tropy for word-sense disambiguation is to allow dis- 
ambiguation algorithms that favor precision over re- 
call to ignore words with high semantic entropy. In 
the same vein, developers of interlinguas for machine 
translation can use semantic entropy to predict he 
required complexity of lexical elements of the repre- 
sentation. 
Another interpretation ofentropy is as the inverse 
of reliability. Machine learning algorithms may ben- 
efit from discounting the importance ofdata that has 
high entropy. For example, an algorithm learning se- 
lectional preferences may not want to generalize the 
statistical characteristics of "take into account" to 
other objects of "take," if it knows that "take" has 
high semantic entropy. I.e. the selectional prefer- 
ences of "take" are hard to predict because it usu- 
ally functions as a support verb. Resnik has used 
semantic entropy to explore selectional preferences, 
although e measured it in a different way (Res93). 
Semantic entropy can help researchers decide not 
only how to work with words, but also which words 
to work with. Several applications in computational 
linguistics use stop-lists of unusual words. The 
canonical example is information retrieval systems, 
which routinely remove function words from queries. 
Another example is algorithms for mapping bitext 
correspondence at the word level. Such algorithms 
work better given a stop-list of words that are not 
likely to have cognates in other languages (Me196a). 
For both of these applications, stop lists are typi- 
cally constructed by rule of thumb and trial and er- 
ror, uninformed by any theoretical underpinning. A
common first approximation is the set of closed-class 
words. As will be illustrated in Section 3, semantic 
entropy may be a better indicator of function-word- 
hood than syntactic lass. 
The function/content word distinction also has a 
long history in psycholingnistics. For example, early 
research in the cognitive neuroscience of language 
suggested that function words and content words 
elicit qualitatively different event-related brain po- 
tentials (K&H83). Later work by the same re- 
searchers revealed that the differences were only 
quantitative and closely tied to word frequency 
41 
(Kim97). Section 4 explores the relationship be- 
tween frequency and semantic entropy. It may be 
as useful or more useful to control semantic entropy 
in psycholinguistic experiments, the way that word 
frequency is usually controlled. 
2 Method  
2.1 Translational Distributions 
The first step in measuring semantic entropy is to 
compute the translational distribution Pr(T\[s) of 
each source word s in a bitext. A relatively simple 
method for estimating this distribution is described 
in (Me196b). Briefly, the method works as follows: 
1. Extract a set of aligned text segment pairs from 
a parallel corpus, e.g. using the techniques in 
(G&Cgla) or in (Me196a). 
2. Construct an initial translation lexicon with 
likelihood scores attached to each entry, e.g. us- 
ing the method in (Mel95) or in (G&Cgl). 
3. Assume that words always translate one-to-one. 
4. Armed with the current lexicon, greedily "link" 
each word token with its most likely translation 
in each pair of aligned segments. 
5. Discard lexicon entries representing word pairs 
that are never linked. 
6. Estimate the parameters of a maximum- 
likelihood word translation model. 
7. Re-estimate the likelihood of each lexicon en- 
try, using the number of times n its components 
co-occur, the number of times k that they are 
linked, and the probability Pr(kln, model). 
8. Repeat from Step 4 until the lexicon converges. 
After the lexicon converges, Step 4 is repeated 
one last time, keeping track of how many times each 
English (source) word is linked to each French (tar- 
get) word. Using the link frequencies F(s, t) and 
the frequencies F(s) of each English source word 
s, the maximum likelihood estimates of Pr(t\[s), the 
probability that s translates to the French target 
word t, can be computed in the usual way: Pr(tls ) = 
F(8,0/F(s). 
2.2 Translational Entropy 
The above method constructs translation lexicons 
containing only word-to-word correspondences. The 
best it can do for compound words like "au chau- 
range" and "right away" is to link their transla- 
tion to the most representative part of the com- 
pound. For example, a typical translation lexicon 
may contain the entries "unemployed/chaumage" 
and "right/imm~liatement." Thisbehavior is quite 
suitable for our purposes, because we are interested 
only in the degree to which the translational proba- 
bility mass is scattered over different arget words, 
42 
not in the particular target words over which it is 
scattered. 
The translational inconsistency of words can be 
computed following the principles of information 
theory z. In information theory, inconsistency is
called entropy. Entropy is a functional of probability 
distribution functions (pdf's). If P is a pdf over the 
random variable X, then the entropy of P is defined 
as2 
g(P) = - E P(z)logP(z). 
zEX 
Since probabilities are always between zero and one, 
their logarithms are always negative; the minus sign 
in the formula ensures that entropies are always pos- 
itive. 
The translational inconsistency of a source word 
s is proportional to the entropy H(T\]s) of its trans- 
lational pdf P(TIs): 
H(TIs  ) = - ~_~ e(t ls  ) log P(tls ). (1) 
tET 
Note that H(T\[s) is not the same as the conditional 
entropy H(TIS ). The latter is a functional of the 
entire pdf of source words, whereas the former is a 
function of the particular source word s. The con- 
ditional entropy is actually a weighted sum of the 
individual translational entropies: 
H(TIS) = ~ P(s)H(Tls). 
aE$ 
2.3 Null Links 
All languages have words that don't translate asily 
into other languages, and paraphrases are common 
in translation. Most bitexts contain a number of 
word tokens in each text for which there is no obvi- 
ous counterpart in the other text. Semantically ight 
words are more likely to be paraphrased or trans- 
lated non-literally. So, the frequency with which a 
particular word gets linked to nothing is an impor- 
tant factor in estimating its semantic entropy. 
Ideally, a measure of translational inconsistency 
should be sensitive to which null links represent the 
same sense of a given source word and which ones 
represent different senses. Given that algorithms 
for making this distinction are currently beyond the 
state of the art, the simplest way to account for 
"null" links is to invent a special NULL  word, and 
to pretend that all null links are actually links to 
NULL  (BD-{-93). This heuristic produces undesired 
results, however, since it implies that the transla- 
tion of a word which is never linked to anything is 
perfectly consistent. A better solution lies at the 
opposite extreme, in the assumption that each null 
link represents a different sense of the source word 
i See (C&T91) for a good introduction.

for Prp(X = x).

To estimate the semantic entropy of English words, 
roughly thirteen million words were used from the 
record of proceedings of the Canadian parliament 
("Hansards"), which is available in English and in 
French. Before induction of the translation lexi- 
con, both halves of the bitext were tagged for part 
of speech (POS) using Brill's transformation-based

tagger (Bri92). The POS information was not used 
in the lexicon induction process but, after estimat- 
ing the semantic entropies for all the English words 
in the corpus, the words were grouped into rough 
part-of-speech categories. 
First, mean semantic entropy was compared 
across parts of speech. Table I lists the mean seman- 
tic entropies Ep  for each part of speech P, sorted by 
\]~p, and the variance of each Ep. The table provides 
empirical evidence for the intuition that function 
words are translated less consistently than content 
words: The mean semantic entropy of each function- 
word POS is higher than that of any content-word 
POS. The table also shows that punctuation and in- 
terjections rank between the function words at the 
top and the content words at the bottom. This rank- 
ing is consistent with the intuition that punctuation 
and interjections have more semantic weight than 
function words, but less than content words.

After analyzing the aggregated results, it was time 
to peek into the semantic entropy rankings within 
each POS. Several of these were particularly inter- 
esting. Table 2 explains the atypically high variance 
of the semantic entropy of punctuation. 
End-of-sentence punctuation is used very con- 
sistently and almost identically in English and in 
French. So, the question mark, the exclamation 
mark and the period have almost no semantic en- 
tropy. In contrast, the two languages have different 
rules for comas and colons, especially around quota- 
tions. Comas and dashes are often used for similar 
purposes, so one is often translated as the other. 
Moreover, English comas are often lost in transla- 
tion. For these reasons, the short Table 2 includes 
both the lowest and the highest semantic entropy 
values for English words in the Hansards. 
Table 3 shows some of the adjectives, ranked by 
semantic Entropy. The top eight adjectives in the 
table say very little about the nouns that they might 
modify. They seem like thinly disguised function 
words that happen to appear in syntactic positions 
normally reserved for adjectives. Adjectives in the 
middle of the table are more typical, but they are 
less specific than the adjectives in the bottom third 
of the table. 
Table 4 displays a sorted sample of the pronouns. 
Topping the list are the English possessive suffixes, 
which have no equivalent in French or in most other 
languages. Existential "there" is next. "It" is high 
on the list because of its frequent pleonastic func- 
tion ("It is necessary to...."). These four pronouns 
are atypically functional. The most frequent of the 
thirty seven pronouns in the corpus, "I," is eleventh 
from the bottom of the list. The most consistently 
44 
translated pronouns are the archaic forms "thee" 
and "thou."

The most interesting ranking of semantic en- 
tropies is among the verbs, including present and 
past participles. As shown in Table 5, verbs can have 
high entropies for several reasons. The verb with 
the highest semantic entropy by far is the functional 
verb place-holder "do." Very high on the list are var- 
ious forms of the functional auxiliaries "be, .... have," 
and "(be) going (to)," as well as the modals "may," 
"might," and "shall." The past participles "con- 
cerning, .... involving," "according," "dealing," and 
"regarding" are near the top of the list because they 
occur most often as the heads of adjectival phrases 
modifying noun phrases, as in "the world accord- 
ing to NP", an English construction that is usually 
paraphrased in translation. "Try" and "let" axe up 
there because they often serve as mere modal mod- 
ifiers of a sentential argument. Most of the other 
verbs at the top of the list are light verbs. Verbs like 
"get," "make," "come," "take," "put, .... stand," and 
"give" are often used as syntactic filler while most 
of the semantic content of the phrase is conveyed by 
their argument. 
4 D iscuss ion  
The most in-depth study of semantic entropy and 
its applications to date was carried out by Resnik 
(Res93; Res95). Resnik's approach differs from the 
present one in three major ways. First, he defines 
semantic entropy over concepts, rather than over 
words. This definition is more useful for his par- 
ticular applications, namely evaluating concept sim- 
ilarity and estimating selectional preferences. Sec- 
ond, in order to measure semantic similarity over 
concepts, his method requires a concept taxonomy, 
such as the Princeton WordNet (Milg0), which is 
grounded in the lexical ontology of a particular lan- 
guage. In contrast, the method presented in this pa- 
per requires a large bitext. Both kinds of resources 
are still available only for a limited number of lan- 
guages, so only one of the two methods may be a 
viable option in any given situation. Third, Resnik's 
measure of information content is defined in terms 
of the logarithm of each concept's frequency in text, 
where the frequency of a concept is defined as the 
sum of the frequencies of words representing that 
concept in the taxonomy. 
Given only monolingual data, log-frequency is a 
relatively good estimator of semantic entropy. Look- 
ing through the various tables in this paper, you may 
have noticed that words with higher entropy tend to 
have higher frequency. Semantic entropy, as mea- 
sured here, actually correlates quite well with the 
logarithm of word frequency (p = 0.79). This corre- 
lation is to be expected, since the max imum possible 
entropy of a word with frequency f is log(f), which 
is what Equation (3) evaluates to when a word is 
always linked to nothing. Yet the correlation is not 
perfect; simply sorting the words by frequency would 
produce a suboptimal result. For instance, the most 
frequent pronoun in Table 4 is eleventh from the 
bottom of the list of thirty seven, because 'T' has 
a very consistent meaning. Likewise, "going" has a 
higher entropy than "go" in Table 5, even though it 
is less than one fifth as frequent, because "going" can 
be used as a near-future tense marker whereas "go" 
has no such function. The best counter-example to 
the correlation between semantic entropy and log- 
frequency is the period, which is the most frequent 
token in the English Hansards and has a semantic 
entropy of zero. 
The method presented here for measuring seman- 
tic entropy is sensitive to ontological and syntactic 
differences between languages. It is partly motivated 
by the observation that translators must paraphrase 
when the target language has no obvious equivalent 
for some word or syntactic construct in the source 
text. There are many more ways to paraphrase 
something than to translate it literally, and trans- 
lators usually strive for variety in order to improve 
readability. That's why, for example, English light 
verbs have such high entropies even though there 
are many English verbs that are more frequent. The 
entropy of English light verbs would likely remain 
relatively high if English/Chinese bitexts were used 
instead of English/French, because the lexicalization 
patterns involving light verbs in English are partic- 
ular to English. Reliance on this property of trans- 
lated texts is a double-edged sword, however, due 
to the converse possibility that two languages share 
an unusual syntactic construct or an unusual bit of 
ontology. In that case, the relevant semantic en- 
tropies may be estimated too low. Ideally, seman- 
tic entropy should be estimated by averaging each 
source language of interest over several different tar- 
get languages. 
A more serious drawback of translational entropy 
as an estimate of semantic entropy is that words 
may be inconsistently ranslated either because they 
don't mean very much or because they mean several 
different things, or both. For example, WordNet 1.5 
lists twenty six senses for the English verb "run." We 
would expect he different senses to have different 
translations in other languages, and we would expect 
several of these senses to occur in any sufficiently 
large bitext, resulting in a high estimate of semantic 
entropy for "run" (5.65 in the Hansards). Mean- 
while, Table 5 shows that the English verb "be" is 
translated much less consistently s than "run," even 
though only nine senses are listed for it in WordNet. 
This is because "be" rarely conveys much informa- 
tion. It is useful to know about both of these com- 
ponents of semantic entropy, but it would be more 
useful to know about hem separately (Ros97). This 
knowledge is contingent on knowledge of the elusive

ference of I represents a factor of 2.

Pr(senselword), which is currently the subject of 
much research (see, e.g. (NS~L96) and references 
therein). Knowing Pr(senselword) would also im- 
prove Resnik's method, which st) far has been forced 
to assume that this distribution is uniform (Res95). 
5 Conc lus ion  
The semantic entropy of a word can be interpreted as 
its semantic ambiguity and is inversely proportional 
to the word's informatio n content, semantic weight, 
and consistency in translation. This paper presented 
an information-theoretic method for measuring the 
semantic entropy of any word in text, using transla- 
tional distributions estimated from parallel text cor- 
pora. This measurement technique has produced en- 
tropy rankings that correspond well with intuitions 
about the relative semantic import of various words 
and word classes. The method can be implemented 
for any language for which a reasonably large bitext 
is available.
