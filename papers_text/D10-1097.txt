Abstract
The research question treated in this paper
is centered on the idea of exploiting rich re-
sources of one language to enhance the per-
formance of a mention detection system of an-
other one. We successfully achieve this goal
by projecting information from one language
to another via a parallel corpus. We exam-
ine the potential improvement using various
degrees of linguistic information in a statisti-
cal framework and we show that the proposed
technique is effective even when the target
language model has access to a significantly
rich feature set. Experimental results show
up to 2.4F improvement in performance when
the system has access to information obtained
by projecting mentions from a resource-rich-
language mention detection system via a par-
allel corpus.
1 Introduction
The task of identifying and classifying entity textual
references in open-domain texts, i.e. the Mention
Detection (MD) task, has become one of the most
important subtasks of Information Extraction (IE).
It might intervene both as one step to structure nat-
ural language texts or as a text enrichment prepro-
cessing step to help other Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) applications reach higher accuracy. Simi-
larly to the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 1
nomenclature, we consider that a mention can be
either named (e.g., John, Chicago), nominal (e.g.,
president, activist) or pronominal (e.g., he, she). It
has also a specific class which describes the type of
the entity it refers to. For instance, in the sentence:
1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2007/doc/ace07-
evalplan.v1.3a.pdf
Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of NYC, declared
his war on tobacco and sugary drinks in the city.
we find the mentions ?Michael Bloomberg?, ?Mayor?
and ?his? of the same person entity. Their types
are named, nominal and pronominal, respectively.
?NYC? and ?city?, on the other hand, are mentions
of the same geopolitical (GPE) entity of type named
and nominal, respectively. Consequently, MD is a
more general and complex task than the well known
Named Entity Recognition (NER) task which aims
solely at the identification and classification of the
named mentions.
The difficulty of the MD task is directly related
to the nature of the language and the linguistic re-
sources available, i.e. it is easier to build accu-
rate MD systems for languages with a simple mor-
phology and a high amount of linguistic resources.
For this reason, we explore the idea of using an
MD system, which has been designed and built for
a resource-rich language (RRL), to help enhance
the performance of an MD system in a target lan-
guage (TL). More specifically, the goal of the re-
search work we present in this paper is to employ
the richness of English, in terms of natural lan-
guage resources, to raise the accuracy of MD sys-
tems in other languages. For instance, an English
MD system might achieve a performance of F?=1-
measure=82.7 (Zitouni and Florian, 2009) when it
resorts to a rich set of features extracted from di-
verse resources, namely: part-of-speech, chunk in-
formation, syntactic parse trees, word sense infor-
mation, WordNet information and information from
the output of other mention detection classifiers. In
this paper, our research question revolves around in-
vestigating an adequate approach to use such a sys-
tem to the benefit of other languages such as Arabic,
Chinese, French or Spanish MD systems, which also
993
have annotated resources but not of the same quan-
tity and/or quality as English.
In this paper, we have targeted English and Arabic
as the RRL and TL, respectively, because:
1. We have a very competitive English MD system;
2. The linguistic resources available for the Arabic
language allow a simulation of different TL richness
levels; and
3. The use of two languages of an utterly different
nature makes the extrapolation of the results to other
languages possible.
Our hypothesis might be expressed as follows: us-
ing an MD system resorting to a rich feature set (i.e.
the RRL MD system) to boost a MD system perfor-
mance in a TL can be very beneficial if the ?donor?
system surpasses its TL counterpart in terms of re-
sources. To test this hypothesis, we have projected
MD tags from RRL to TL via a parallel corpus, and
then extracted several linguistic features about the
automatically tagged words. Thereafter, we have
conducted experiments adding these new features to
the TL baseline MD system. In order to have a com-
plete picture on the impact of these new features, we
have used TL baseline systems resorting to a varied
amount of features, starting with a case employing
only lexical information to a case where we use all
the resources we could gather for the TL. Experi-
ments show that the gain is always statistically sig-
nificant and it reaches its maximum when only very
basic features are used in the baseline TL MD sys-
tem.
2 Mention Detection
Similarly to classical NLP tasks, such as Base
Phrase Chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999)
(BPC) or NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formu-
late the MD task as a sequence classification prob-
lem, i.e. the classifier assigns to each token in the
text a label indicating whether it starts a specific
mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside
any mentions. It also assigns to every non outside
mention a class to specify its type: e.g., person, or-
ganization, location, etc. In this study, we chose the
Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM hence-
forth) approach because it can easily integrate arbi-
trary types of information in order to make a clas-
sification decision. To train our models, we have
used the Sequential Conditional Generalized Itera-
tive Scaling (SCGIS) technique (Goodman, 2002).
This techniques uses a Gaussian prior for regular-
ization (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000). The features
used by our MD systems can be divided into the fol-
lowing categories:
1- Lexical: these are token n-grams directly neigh-
boring the current token on both sides, i.e. left and
right. Empirical results have shown that the optimal
span is n = 3.
2- Syntactic: they consist of the outcomes of several
Part-Of-Speech (POS) taggers and BPCs trained on
different corpora and different tag-sets in order to
provide the MD system with a wider variety of in-
formation. Our model uses the POS and BPC in-
formation appearing in window of 5 (current, two
previous, and two next) jointly with the tokens.
Both the English and the Arabic MD systems have
access to lexical and syntactic features. The former
one, however, also employs a set of features ob-
tained from the output of other MD classifiers. In
order to provide the MD system with complemen-
tary information, these classifiers are trained on dif-
ferent datasets annotated for different mention types,
e.g. dates or occupation references (not used in our
task).
3 Annotation, Projection and Feature
Extraction
We remind the reader that our main goal is to use
an RRL MD system to enhance the performance of
an MD system in another language, i.e. the TL. In
order to achieve this goal, we propose an approach
that uses an RRL-to-TL parallel corpus to bridge be-
tween these two languages. This approach performs
in three main steps, namely: annotation, projection
and feature extraction. In this section, we describe
in details each of these steps.
3.1 Annotation
This first step consists of MD tagging of the RRL
side of the parallel corpus. Because in our case study
we have chosen English as the RRL, we have used
an accurate English MD system to perform the an-
notation step. Our English MD system achieves an
F-measure of 82.7 (Zitouni and Florian, 2009) and
has achieved significantly competitive results at the
ACE evaluation campaign.
3.2 Projection
Once the RRL side of the parallel corpus is accu-
rately augmented with MD tags, the projection step
comes to transfer those tags to the TL side, Arabic
in our case study, using the word alignment informa-
tion. We illustrate the projection step with a relevant
example. Let consider the following MD tagged En-
glish sentence:
994
Bill/B-PER-NAM Clinton/I-PER-NAM is visiting
North/B-GPE-NAM Korea/I-GPE-NAM today
where ?Bill Clinton? is a named person mention and
?North Korea? is a named geopolitical entity (GPE)
one. A potential Arabic translation of this sentence
would be:
??J
? @

?J
?A?
??@ AK
P?? P?
	QK

	
??

J
	
J
?? ?J
K.
which might be transliterated as:
byl klyntwn yzwr kwryA Al$mAlyA Alywm
After projecting the English mentions to the Ara-
bic text, we obtain the following:
byl/B-PER-NAM klyntwn/I-PER-NAM yzwr
kwryA/B-GPE-NAM Al$mAlyp/I-GPE-NAM
Alywm
This tagged version of the Arabic text is provided to
the third module of the process responsible on fea-
ture extraction (see Subsection 3.3). It is, however,
pertinent to point out that the example we have used
for illustration is relatively simple in the sense that
almost all English and Arabic words have a 1-to-1
mapping. In real world translation (both human and
automatic), one should expect to see 1-to-n, n-to-1
mappings as well as unmapped words on both sides
of the parallel corpus rather frequently.
As stated by (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), the pro-
jection of NER tags is easier in comparison to pro-
jecting other types of annotations such as POS-tags
and BPC2, mainly because:
1. Not all the words are mentions: once we have pro-
jected the tags of the mentions from the RRL to TL
side, the rest of tokens are simply considered as out-
side any mentions. This is different from the POS-
tag and BPC where all the words are assigned a tag
and thus when a word is unmapped, further process-
ing is required (Yarowsky et al, 2001);
2. In case of a 1-to-n mapping, the target n
words are assigned the same class: for instance, let
consider the English GPE named mention ?North-
Korea?. The segmented version of its Arabic transla-
tion would be ?

?J
?A??
? ?@ AK
P??? (kwrya Al $mAlyp).
The projection process consists in simply assigning
the same class, i.e. GPE, to all Arabic tokens. The
problem takes another dimension, however, in the
case of propagating the POS-tags, because ?North?
is a NNP aligned with the determinant (DET) ?Al?
and the NNP ?$mAlyp?. Additional processing is
needed to handle this difference of tags on the two
2The claim is also valid for MD because it is the same type
of annotation.
sides.
3. In case of n-to-1 mapping, the TL side word is
simply assigned the class propagated from the RRL
side. For instance, if on the English side we have the
named person multi-word mention ?Ben Moussa?,
translated into the one-word mention ?????	JK. (bn-
mwsY) on the Arabic side, then projection consists
of simply assigning the person named tag to the Ara-
bic word.
However, in our research study, new challenges
arose because our RRL data are automatically an-
notated, which is different from what has been re-
ported in the research works we have mentioned be-
fore, i.e. (Yarowsky et al, 2001) and (Klementiev
and Roth, 2006), where gold annotated data were
used. In order to relax the impact of the noise intro-
duced by the English MD system, we :
1. use mention ?splits? to filter annotation errors:
We assume that when a sequence of tokens is tagged
as a mention on the RRL side, its TL counterpart
should be an uninterrupted sequence of tokens as
well. When the RRL MD system captures incor-
rectly the span of a mention, e.g. in the sentence
?Dona Karan international reputation of ...?, the
RRL MD system might mistakenly tag ?Dona Karan
international? as an organization mention instead of
tagging ?Dona Karan? as a person mention. It is pos-
sible to detect this type of errors on the TL side be-
cause ?dwnA kArAn? (Dona Karan) is distant from
?Al EAlmyp? (international), i.e. they do not form
an uninterrupted token sequence. We use this ?split?
in the mentions as information in order to not use
these mentions in the feature extraction step (see
Subsection 3.3).
2. do not use the projected mentions directly for
training: Instead, we use these tags as additional
features to our TL baseline model and allow our
MEMM classifier to weigh them according to their
relevance to each mention type.
3.3 Feature Extraction
At this point, the parallel corpus should be anno-
tated with mentions on both of its sides. Where
the RRL side is tagged using the English MD
system during the annotation step (c.f section 3.1)
while the TL side is annotated by the propagation
of these MD tags via the parallel corpus in the
projection step (c.f. section 3.2). In this third step,
the goal is to extract pertinent linguistic features
of the automatically tagged TL corpus to enhance
MD model in the TL. The explored features are as
follows:
995
1. Gazetteers: we group mentions by class in
different dictionaries. During both training and
decoding, when we encounter a token or a sequence
of tokens that is part of a dictionary, we fire its
corresponding class; the feature is fired only when
we find a complete match between sequence of
tokens in the text and in the dictionary.
2. Model-based features: it consists of building a
model on the automatically tagged TL side of the
parallel corpus. The output of this model is used
as a feature to enhance MD model in the target
language. However, it is also possible to use this
model to directly tag text in the TL. This would
be useful in cases where we do not have any TL
annotated data.
3. n-gram context features: it consists of using
the annotated corpus in the TL to collect n-gram
tokens surrounding a mention. We organize those
contexts by mention type and we use them to
tag tokens which appear in the same context
in both the training and decoding sets. These
tags will be used as additional feature in the
MD model. For instance, if we consider that
the person mention 	?
?k ?@Y? (SdAm Hsyn -
Sadam Husein) appears in the following sentence:
C ?A
	
? A?A
	
?
	
 ?

@Q

K

	?
?k ?@Y?
	
?

@ ??

@ hQ??
which might be transliterated as: SrH Ams An SdAm
Hsyn ytrAs nZAmA fA$lA and translated to English
as: declared yesterday that Sadam Husein governs
a failed system
the context n-grams that would be extracted are:
. Left n-grams: W?1=
	
?

@ (An - that),
W?2=
	
?

@ ??

@ (Ams An - yesterday that), etc.
. Right n-grams: W+1=?

@Q

K
 (ystrAs - governs),
W+2= A?A
	
?
	
 ?

@Q

K
 (ytrAs nZAmA - governs a sys-
tem), etc.
. Left and right n-grams: a joint of the two previ-
ous features, W?i and W+i.
For both training and test data we create a new
feature stream where we indicate that a token se-
quence is a mention if it appears in the same n-gram
context.
4. Head-word based features: it considers that
the lexical context in which the mention appeared
is the sequence of the parent sub-trees head words
in a parse-tree. For instance, if we consider the sen-
tence which we have used in the previous example,
the corresponding parse tree is shown in Figure 1.
The parent sub-tree heads of ?SdAm Hsyn? are

features, in both training and decoding sets, we
create a new feature stream where we tag those
token sequences which appear with the same n first
parent sub-tree head words as a person mention in
the annotated TL data.
5. Parser-based features: it attempts to use the
syntactic environment in which a mention might ap-
pear. In order to do so, for each mention in the tar-
get language corpus we consider only labels of the
parent non-terminals .We mark parent non-terminal
labels of ?SdAm Hsyn? on the tree with pi. Simi-
larly to the features described above, we create dur-
ing both training and test a new feature stream where
we indicate the token sequences which appear in the
same parent non-terminal labels.
Gazetteers and model-based features are the most
natural and expected kind of features that one would
extract from the automatically MD tagged version of
the TL text. Our motivation of using n-gram context
features, on one hand, and the head-word based and
parse-based features on the other is to: (i) contrast
the impact of local and global context features; and
(ii) experiment the possibility of employing both of
them jointly in order to test their complementarity.
4 The Target Language Mention Detection
System
- The Arabic language: In our research study, we
have intentionally chosen a TL which is differs from
English in its strategy in forming words and sen-
tences. By doing so, we are seeking to avoid ob-
taining results which are biased by the similarity of
the employed languages. For this reason, we have
996
chosen Arabic as a TL.
Due to its Semitic origins, the Arabic language is
both derivational, i.e. it uses a templatic strategy
to form a word, and highly inflectional, i.e. addi-
tional affixes might be added to a word in order to
obtain further meaning. Whereas the former char-
acteristic is common in most languages, the latter,
however, results in increasing sparseness in data
and consequently forming an obstacle to achieve a
high performance for most of the NLP tasks (Diab
et al, 2004; Benajiba et al, 2008; Zitouni et al,
2005; Zitouni and Florian, 2008). From a NLP
viewpoint, especially the supervised tasks such as
the one we are dealing with in this paper, this im-
plies that a huge amount of training data is nec-
essary in order to build a robust model. In our
study, to tackle the data sparseness problem, we have
performed the word segmentation. This segmenta-
tion pre-processing step consists of separating the
normal white-space delimited words into prefixes,
stems, and suffixes. Thus, from a modeling view-
point, the unit of analysis becomes the segments. We
use a technique similar to the one introduced in (Lee
et al, 2003) for segmentation with an accuracy of
98%.
- The Arabic MD system: Our Arabic MD system
employs the same technique presented in Section 2.
Compared to English MD model, Arabic MD sys-
tem has access to morphological information (Stem)
as we will explain next. Features used by the Arabic
MD system are divided in three categories:
1. Lexical: Similar to the lexical features used by
our English MD system (c.f. section 2);
2. Stem: This feature has been introduced in (Zitouni
et al, 2005) as stem n-grams spanning the current
stem; both preceding and following it. If the current
token xi is a stem, stem n-gram features contain the
previous n? 1 stems and the following n? 1 stems.
Stem n-gram features represent a lexical generaliza-
tion that reduce data sparseness;
3. Syntactic: it consists of the output of POS taggers
and the BPCs.
As we describe with more details in the experiments
section (see Section 6), once we have extracted the
new features from the parallel corpus, we contrast
their impact with the level of richness in features of
the TL MD system, i.e. we measure the impact of
each feature fi when the TL MD system uses: (i)
only lexical features; (ii) both lexical and stem fea-
tures; and (iii) lexical, stem and syntactic features.
5 Evaluation Data
Experiments are conducted on the Arabic ACE 2007
data. There are 379 Arabic documents and al-
most 98, 000 words. We find seven classes of men-
tions: Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Geo-
Political Entity (GPE), Location (LOC), Facility
(FAC), Vehicle (VEH) and Weapon (WEA). Since
the evaluation test sets are not publicly available,
we have split the publicly available training cor-
pus into an 85%/15% data split. We use 323 doc-
uments (80, 000 words) for training and 56 docu-
ments (18, 000 words) as a test set. This results
in 17, 634 mentions (7, 816 named, 8, 831 nominal
and 987 pronominal) for training and 3, 566 for test
(1, 673 named, 1, 682 nominal and 211 pronominal).
To facilitate future comparisons with work presented
here, and to simulate a realistic scenario, the splits
are created based on article dates: the test data is se-
lected as the latest 15% of the data in chronological
order, in each of the covered genres (newswire and
webblog). Performance on the ACE data is usually
evaluated using a special-purpose measure, i.e. the
ACE value metric. However, given that we are inter-
ested in the mention detection task only, we decided
to use the more intuitive and popular (un-weighted)
F-measure, the harmonic mean of precision and re-
call.
6 Experiments and Results
As we have stated earlier, our main goal is to in-
vestigate how an MD model of a TL might bene-
fit from additional information about the mentions
obtained by propagation from an RRL. In our re-
search study we have chosen Arabic as the TL and
English as the RRL. The English MD system we use
has access to a large set of information (Zitouni and
Florian, 2009) and has achieved a performance of
82.7F on ACE?07 data. In order to simulate differ-
ent levels of resource-richness for the TL, we have
employed four baseline systems which use different
feature-sets. Following we present these feature-sets
ranked from the resource-poorest to the resource-
richest one: 1- Lex.: lexical features; 2- Stem.:
Lex. + stem features; and 3- Syntac.: Stem. + syn-
tactic features.
For each of these baseline systems, we study the im-
pact of features extracted from the parallel corpus
(c.f. Section 3) separately. We report the following
results:
1- Base.: baseline system without the use of
parallel-data extracted features;
2- n? Lex.: Base. + n-gram context features;

5- Gaz.: Base. + automatically extracted
gazetteers from the parallel corpus;
6- Model: Base. + output of model trained on the
Arabic part of the parallel corpus;
7- Comb.: combination of all the above.
In the rest of the paper, to measure whether the im-
provement in performance of a system using fea-
tures from parallel data over baseline is statistically
significant or not, we use the stratified bootstrap re-
sampling significance test (Noreen, 1989) used in
the NER shared task of CoNLL-20023. We consider
results as statistically significant when p < 0.02.
6.1 Hand-aligned Data
In our first experiment-set, we use a hand-aligned
English-to-Arabic parallel corpus of approximately
one million words. After tagging the Arabic side
by projection we obtain 86.5K mentions. As we
have previously mentioned, in order to generate
the model-based feature, Model, we have trained a
model on the Arabic side of the parallel corpus. This
model achieved an F-measure of 57.7F. This shows
the performance that might be achieved when no hu-
man annotated data is available in the TL.
Results in Table 1 show that a significant improve-
ment is obtained when the TL is poor in resources;
for instance an improvement of ?1.9 points was
achieved when the TL used only lexical features.
The use of n ? Pars. features alone yielded 1.2
points of improvement. when the TL model uses a
rich feature-set, we still can obtain ?1.7 points im-
provement. When the TL baseline model employs
the Syntac feature-set, the greatest improvement
is obtained when we add the model-based feature.
Improvement obtained by the system using Comb.

features is statistically significant compared to the
baseline model. This system also outperforms sys-
tems using the new feature set separately across the
board. According to our error-analysis, the signif-
icant amount of Arabic mentions observed in the
parallel corpus, where many of them do not appear
in the training corpus, has significantly helped the
Lex., Stem and SyntacMD models to capture new
mentions and/or correct the type assigned. Some of
the relevant examples in our data are: (i) the facility
mention P?
	
??K. ?
	
?J.? (mbnY blfwr - Belvoir Build-
ing); (ii) the GPE mention ??K. A? (kAbwl - Kabul);
and (iii) the person mention 	?




J?J. ? @ (AlbEvyyn - the
Baathists). These mentions have only been tagged
correctly when we have added the new extracted fea-
tures to our model.
In other words, the error-analysis clearly points out
that one possible way to get further improvement is
to increase the parallel data in order to increase the
number of matches between (1) the number of men-
tions which are wrongly tagged by the TL MD model
and (2) the number of mentions in the TL side of the
parallel corpus. The second parameter can be, indi-
rectly, increased by increasing the size of the paral-
lel data. Getting 10 or 20 times more of parallel data
that is hand-aligned is expensive and requires sev-
eral months of human/hours work. For this reason
we opted for using an unsupervised approach by se-
lecting a parallel corpus that is automatically aligned
as we discuss in the next section.
6.2 Automatically-aligned Data
We have used for this experiment-set an Arabic-to-
English parallel data of 22 million words. The data
in this corpus is automatically aligned using a tech-
nique presented in (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005).
The alignment is one-to-many with a performance
around 87 F-measure.
Because we are dealing with a large amount of
data and the word alignment is done automatically,
meaning more noise, we have used the English MD
model confidence for additional filtering. Such fil-
tering consists in keeping, from the parallel corpus,
only sentences which have all tokens tagged with a
confidence greater than ?. In this paper, we use a
value of ? = 0.94, which results in a corpus of 17
million words. We notice that a lower value of ? re-
sults in a radical increase in noise. Because of space
limitation, we will report results only with this value
of ?.
Table 2 shows the obtained results for parallel-

Table 2: Obtained results when the features were ex-
tracted from a automatically-aligned parallel corpus
data based features using the 17M subset. Differ-
ently from experiments using hand-aligned data, the
best results have been obtained when we have used
the parser-based feature, i.e. n ? Pars. On one
hand, the overall behavior is comparable to the one
obtained when using the 1M hand-aligned parallel
data (see Table 1), i.e. (i) the greatest improve-
ment has been obtained when the TL uses a poor
feature-set; and (ii) when the TL baseline model is
rich in resources, we still obtain 0.45 points absolute
improvement when using n ? Pars. On the other
hand, features extracted from automatically-aligned
data, in comparison with the ones extracted from the
hand aligned data, have helped the MD model to cor-
rect many of the TL baseline model false negatives.
This has been observed when the TL baseline sys-
tem uses a rich feature set as well. A side effect of
the noisy word alignment, however, was an increase
in the number of false positives. For instance, the
word H@Q?	?jJ?? (mstHDrAt - preparations) which
appeared in the following sentence:
?Q
	
k

@ H@Q?
	
?j

J??? hA???@ ?Y?
which might be transliterated as:
Edm AlsmAH lmstHDrAt AxrY
and translated to English as:
not to allow other preparations
has been tagged as an organization mention because
it has been mistakenly aligned, in the parallel cor-
pus, with the word ?A?, KO, in the sentence:

?J
?J
?j.

J? @ H@Q?

In order to validate our results, we run our exper-
iments on a blind test-set. We have selected the
latest 5% of each genre of the hand-aligned data

man. The blind test-set consists of 51,781 tokens of
which 6,481 are mentions. Table 3 shows the distri-
bution of these mentions over the different classes.
The results are shown in Table 4. These results con-
firm the conclusions we have deduced from the ones
previously presented in Table 2, i.e.: (i) the highest
improvement is obtained when the TL is resource-
scarce.
6.3 Combining Hand-aligned and
Automatically-aligned Data

extracted from hand-aligned and automatically-
aligned corpora has led to better results. The im-

provement of using Comb. compared to baseline is
statistically significant. We notice again that when
the TL baseline MD model uses a richer feature set,
the obtained improvement from using RRL becomes
smaller. We also observed that automatically aligned
data helped capture most of the unseen mentions
whereas the hand-aligned features helped decrease
the number of false-alarms. It is important to notice
that when features Comb. is used with Stem base-
line model, the obtained F-measure (76.85) is 1.3
higher than the baseline model which uses lexical,
stem and syntactic features ? Syntac (75.53). The
type of errors which mostly occur and has not been
fixed neither by using hand-aligned data, automati-
cally aligned data nor the combination of both are
the nominal mentions whose class depends fully on
the context. For instance, the word
	
?
	
??? (mwZf -
employee) which was considered as O by the MD
model because it has not been seen in any of the par-
allel data in a context such as the following:
. . . 	?A? ?

transliterated as:

7 Previous Works
Several research works, in different NLP tasks, have
shown that the use of an RRL to achieve a better
performance in a resource-challenged language
yields to successful results. In (Rogati et al, 2003),
authors used a statistical machine translation (MT)
system to build an Arabic stemmer. The obtained
stemmer has a performance of 87.5%. In (Ide et al,
2002), authors use the aligned versions of George
Orwell?s Nineteen Eighty-Four in seven languages
in order to determine sense distinctions which can
be used in the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
task. They report that the automatically obtained
tags are at least as reliable as the one made by hu-
man annotators. Similarly, (Ng et al, 2003) report a
research study which uses an English-Chinese par-
allel corpus in order to extract sense-tagged training
data. In (Hwa et al, 2002), authors report promising
results of inducing Chinese dependency trees from
English. The obtained model outperformed the
baseline.
One of the significant differences between these
works and the one we present in this paper is that
instead of using the propagated annotation directly
as training data we use it as an additional feature and
thus allow the MEMM model to weigh each one of
them. By doing so, the model is able to distinguish
between the relevant and the irrelevant information
propagated from the RRL.
Authors in (Zitouni and Florian, 2008) attempt to
enhance an MD model of a foreign language by us-
ing an English MD system. They have used an MT
system to (i) translate the text to English; (ii) run the
English model on the translated text; (iii) and prop-
agate outcome to the original text. The approach
in (Zitouni and Florian, 2008) requires a MT system
that needs more effort and resources to build when
compared to a parallel corpus (used in our experi-
ments); not all institutions may have access to MT
and MD systems in plenty of language pairs.
8 Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper, we presented a novel approach that al-
lows to exploit the richness, in terms of resources, of
one language (English) to the benefit of a target lan-
guage (Arabic). We achieved successful results by
adopting a novel approach performing in three main
steps, namely: (i) Annotate the English side of an
English-to-Arabic parallel corpus automatically; (ii)
Project the obtained annotation from English to Ara-
bic via the parallel corpus; and (iii) Extract features
of different linguistic motivations of the automati-
cally tagged Arabic tokens. Thereafter, each of the
extracted features is used to bootstrap Arabic MD
system. We use different Arabic baseline MD mod-
els which employ different feature sets representing
different levels of richness in resources. We also use
both a one million word hand-aligned parallel cor-
pus and a 22 million word automatically aligned one
in order to study size vs. noise trade-off.
Results show that a statistically significant improve-
ment is always observed even when the Arabic base-
line MD model uses all the available resources.
When we use the hand-aligned parallel corpus, we
obtain up to 2.2 points improvement when the Ara-
bic MD model has access to very limited resources.
It decreases to 1.7 points when we use all the re-
sources we could gather for the Arabic language.
When no human-annotated data is available in the
TL, we show that we can obtain a performance of
57.6 using only mention propagation from RRL.
The results also show that a greater improvement
is achieved when using a small hand-aligned corpus
than using a 20 times bigger automatically aligned
data. However, in case both of them are available,
combining them leads to even higher results.
