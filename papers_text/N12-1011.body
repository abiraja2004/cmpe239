Abstract
Most previous research on automated speech
scoring has focused on restricted, predictable
speech. For automated scoring of unrestricted
spontaneous speech, speech proficiency has
been evaluated primarily on aspects of pro-
nunciation, fluency, vocabulary and language
usage but not on aspects of content and topi-
cality. In this paper, we explore features repre-
senting the accuracy of the content of a spoken
response. Content features are generated us-
ing three similarity measures, including a lex-
ical matching method (Vector Space Model)
and two semantic similarity measures (Latent
Semantic Analysis and Pointwise Mutual In-
formation). All of the features exhibit moder-
ately high correlations with human proficiency
scores on human speech transcriptions. The
correlations decrease somewhat due to recog-
nition errors when evaluated on the output of
an automatic speech recognition system; how-
ever, the additional use of word confidence
scores can achieve correlations at a similar
level as for human transcriptions.
1 Introduction
Automated assessment of a non-native speaker?s
proficiency in a given language is an attractive ap-
plication of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
natural language processing (NLP) technology; the
technology can be used by language learners for
individual practice and by assessment providers to
reduce the cost of human scoring. While much
research has been done about the scoring of re-
stricted speech, such as reading aloud or repeating
sentences verbatim (Cucchiarini et al., 1997; Bern-
stein et al., 2000; Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Witt and
Young, 2000; Franco et al., 2000; Bernstein et al.,
2010b), much less has been done about the scor-
ing of spontaneous speech. For automated scor-
ing of unrestricted, spontaneous speech, most auto-
mated systems have estimated the non-native speak-
ers? speaking proficiency primarily based on low-
level speaking-related features, such as pronuncia-
tion, intonation, rhythm, rate of speech, and fluency
(Cucchiarini et al., 2002; Zechner et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2009; Chen and Zechner, 2011a), although a
few recent studies have explored features based on
vocabulary and grammatical complexity (Zechner et
al., 2007; Bernstein et al., 2010a; Bernstein et al.,
2010b; Chen and Zechner, 2011b).
To date, little work has been conducted on au-
tomatically assessing the relatively higher-level as-
pects of spontaneous speech, such as the content
and topicality, the structure, and the discourse in-
formation. Automated assessment of these aspects
of a non-native speaker?s speech is very challeng-
ing for a number of reasons, such as the short length
of typical responses (approximately 100 words for
a typical 1 minute response, compared to over 300
words in a typical essay/written response), the spon-
taneous nature of the speech, and the presence of
disfluencies and possible grammatical errors. More-
over, the assessment system needs text transcripts
of the speech to evaluate the high level aspects, and
these are normally obtained from ASR systems. The
recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art ASR sys-
tems on non-native spontaneous speech is still rel-
atively low, which will sequentially impact the re-
103
liability and accuracy of automatic scoring systems
using these noisy transcripts. However, despite these
difficulties, it is necessary for an automated assess-
ment system to address the high level information
of a spoken response in order to fully cover all as-
pects that are considered by human raters. Thus, in
this paper we focus on exploring features to repre-
sent the high-level aspect of speech mainly on the
accuracy of the content.
As a starting point, we consider approaches that
have been used for the automated assessment of con-
tent in essays. However, due to the qualitative dif-
ferences between written essays and spontaneous
speech, the techniques developed for written texts
may not perform as well on spoken responses. Still,
as a baseline, we will evaluate the content features
used for essay scoring on spontaneous speech. In
addition to a straightforward lexical Vector Space
Model (VSM), we investigate approaches using two
other similarity measures, Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA) and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), in
order to represent the semantic-level proficiency of
a speaker. All of the content features are analyzed
using both human transcripts and speech recognizer
output, so we can have a better understanding of the
impact of ASR errors on the performance of the fea-
tures. As expected, the results show that the per-
formance on ASR output is lower than when hu-
man transcripts are used. Therefore, we propose im-
proved content features that take into account ASR
confidence scores to emphasize responses whose es-
timated word accuracy is comparatively higher than
others. These improved features can obtain similar
performance when compared to the results using hu-
man transcripts.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next
section we introduce previous research on auto-
mated assessment of content in essays and spoken
responses. The content features we generated and
the model we used to build the final speaking scores
are described in Sections 3 and Section 4, respec-
tively. In Section 5 we show the performance of
all our proposed features. Finally, we conclude our
work and discuss potential future work in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Most previous research on assessment of non-native
speech has focused on restricted, predictable speech;
see, for example, the collection of articles in (Es-
kenazi et al., 2009). When assessing spontaneous
speech, due to relatively high word error rates of
current state-of-the-art ASR systems, predominantly
features related to low-level information have been
used, such as features related to fluency, pronuncia-
tion or prosody (Zechner et al., 2009).
For scoring of written language (automated essay
scoring), on the other hand, several features related
to the high level aspects have been used previously,
such as the content and the discourse information.
In one approach, the lexical content of an essay was
evaluated by using a VSM to compare the words
contained in each essay to the words found in a sam-
ple of essays from each score category (Attali and
Burstein, 2006). In addition, this system also used
an organization feature measuring the difference be-
tween the ideal structure of an essay and the actual
discourse elements found in the essay. The features
designed for measuring the overall organization of
an essay assumed a writing strategy that included
an introductory paragraph, at least a three-paragraph
body with each paragraph in the body consisting of
a pair of main point, supporting idea elements, and
a concluding paragraph. In another approach, the
content of written essays were evaluated using LSA
by comparing the test essays with essays of known
quality in regard of their degree of conceptual rele-
vance and the amount of relevant content (Foltz et
al., 1999).
There has been less work measuring spoken re-
sponses in terms of the higher level aspects. In
(Zechner and Xi, 2008), the authors used a content
feature together with other features related to vocab-
ulary, pronunciation and fluency to build an auto-
mated scoring system for spontaneous high-entropy
responses. This content feature was the cosine word
vector product between a test response and the train-
ing responses which have the highest human score.
The experimental results showed that this feature
did not provide any further contribution above a
baseline of only using non-content features, and
for some tasks the system performance was even
slightly worse after including this feature. However,
104
we think the observations about the content features
used in this paper were not reliable for the following
two reasons: the number of training responses was
limited (1000 responses), and the ASR system had a
relatively high Word Error Rate (39%).
In this paper, we provide further analysis on the
performance of several types of content features.
Additionally, we used a larger amount of training
data and a better ASR system in an attempt to extract
more meaningful and accurate content features.
3 Automatic Content Scoring
In automatic essay scoring systems, the content of an
essay is typically evaluated by comparing the words
it contains to the words found in a sample of es-
says from each score category (1-4 in our experi-
ments), where the scores are assigned by trained hu-
man raters. The basic idea is that good essays will
resemble each other in their word choice, as will
poor essays. We follow this basic idea when extract-
ing content features for spoken responses.
3.1 Scoring Features
For each test spoken response, we calculate its simi-
larity scores to the sample responses from each score
category. These scores indicate the degree of simi-
larity between the words used in the test response
and the words used in responses from different score
points. Using these similarity scores, 3 content fea-
tures are generated in this paper:
? Simmax: the score point which has the high-
est similarity score between test response and
score vector
? Sim4: the similarity score to the responses
with the highest score category (4 in our ex-
periments).
? Simcmb: the linear combination of the similar-
ity scores to each score category.
4?
i=1
wi ? Simi (1)
where wi is scaled to [-1, 1] to imply its positive
or negative impact.
3.2 Similarity Measures
There are many ways to calculate the similarity be-
tween responses. A simple and commonly used
method is the Vector Space Model, which is also
used in automated essay scoring systems. Under this
approach, all the responses are converted to vectors,
whose elements are weighted using TF*IDF (term
frequency, inverse document frequency). Then, the
cosine similarity score between vectors can be used
to estimate the similarity between the responses the
vectors originally represent.
Other than this lexical matching method, we also
try two additional similarity measures to better cap-
ture the semantic level information: Latent Semantic
Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998) and a corpus-based
semantic similarity measure based on pointwise mu-
tual information (Mihalcea et al., 2006). LSA has
been widely used for computing document similar-
ity and other information retrieval tasks. Under this
approach, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is
used to analyze the statistical relationship between a
set of documents and the words they contain. A m?n
word-document matrix X is first built, in which each
element Xij represents the weighted term frequency
of word i in document j. The matrix is decomposed
into a product of three matrices as follows:
X = U?V T (2)
where U is an m?m matrix of left-singular vectors,
? is an m?n diagonal matrix of singular values, and
V is the n? n matrix of right-singular vectors.
The top ranked k singular values in ? are kept,
and the left is set to be 0. So ? is reformulated as ?k.
The original matrix X is recalculated accordingly,
Xk = U?kV
T (3)
This new matrix Xk can be considered as a
smoothed or compressed version of the original ma-
trix. LSA measures the similarity of two documents
by calculating the cosine between the corresponding
compressed column vectors.
PMI was introduced to calculate the semantic
similarity between words in (Turney, 2001). It is
based on the word co-occurrence on a large corpus.
Given two words, their PMI is computed using:
PMI(w1, w2) = log2
p(w1&w2)
p(w1) ? p(w2)
(4)
105
This indicates the statistical dependency between w1
and w2, and can be used as a measure of the semantic
similarity of two words.
Given the word-to-word similarity, we can calcu-
late the similarity between two documents using the
following function,
sim(D1, D2) =
1
2
(
?
w?{D1} (maxSim(w,D2) ? idf(w))?
w?{D1} idf(w)
+
?
w?{D2}(maxSim(w,D1) ? idf(w)?
w?{D2} idf(w))
)
(5)
maxSim(w,Di) = maxwj?{Di}PMI(w,wj)
(6)
For each word w in document D1, we find the word
in document D2 which has the highest similarity
to w. Similarly, for each word in D2, we iden-
tify the most similar words in D1. The similarity
score between two documents is then calculated by
combining the similarity of the words they contain,
weighted by their word specificity (i.e., IDF values).
In this paper, we use these three similarity mea-
sures to calculate the similarity between the test re-
sponse and the training responses for each score cat-
egory. Using the VSM method, we convert all the
training responses in one score category into one big
vector, and for a given test response we calculate its
cosine similarity to this vector as its similarity to that
corresponding score point vector. For the other simi-
larity measures, we calculate the test response?s sim-
ilarity to each of the training responses in one score
category, and report the average score as its similar-
ity to this score point. We also tried using this av-
erage similarity score for the VSM method, but our
experimental results showed that this average score
obtained lower performance than using one big vec-
tor generated from all the training samples due to
data sparsity. After the similarity scores to each of
the four score categories are computed, the content
features introduced in Section 3.1 are then extracted
and are used to evaluate the speaking proficiency of
the speaker.
4 System Architecture
This section describes the architecture of our auto-
mated content scoring system, which is shown in
Figure 1. First, the test taker?s voice is recorded,
and sent to the automatic speech recognition system.
Second, the feature computation module takes the
output hypotheses from the speech recognizer and
generates the content features. The last component
considers all the scoring features, and produces the
final score for each spoken response.

Figure 1: Architecture of the automated content scoring
system.
While we are using human transcripts of spoken
responses as a baseline in this paper, we want to note
that in an operational system as depicted in this fig-
ure, the scoring features are computed and extracted
using the hypotheses from the ASR system, which
exhibits a relatively high word error rate. These
recognition errors will sequentially impact the pro-
cess of calculating the similarity and computing the
content scores, and decrease the performance of the
final speaking scores. In order to improve the system
performance in this ASR condition, we explore the
use of word confidence scores from the ASR system
during feature generation. In particular, the similar-
ity scores between the test response and each score
category are weighted using the recognition confi-
dence score of the response, so that the scores can
also contain information related to its acoustic accu-
racy. The confidence score for one response is the
average value of all the confidence scores for each
word contained in the response. In Section 5, we
will evaluate the performance of our proposed con-
tent features using both human transcripts and ASR
outputs, as well as the enhanced content features us-
106
ing ASR confidence scores.
5 Experimental Results
5.1 Data
The data we use for our experiments are from the
Test of English as a Foreign Language R? internet-
based test (TOEFL iBT) in which test takers respond
to several stimuli using spontaneous speech. This
data set contains 24 topics, of which 8 are opinion-
based tasks, and 16 are contextual-based tasks. The
opinion-based tasks ask the test takers to provide
information or opinions on familiar topics based
on their personal experience or background knowl-
edge. The purpose of these tasks is to measure the
speaking ability of examinees independent of their
ability to read or listen to English language. The
contextual-based tasks engage reading, listening and
speaking skills in combination to mimic the kinds
of communication expected of students in campus-
based situations and in academic courses. Test tak-
ers read and/or listen to some stimulus materials and
then respond to a question based on them. For each
of the tasks, after task stimulus materials and/or test
questions are delivered, the examinees are allowed a
short time to consider their response and then pro-
vide their responses in a spontaneous manner within
either 45 seconds (for the opinion-based tasks) or 60
seconds (for the contextual-based tasks).
For each topic, we randomly select 1800 re-
sponses for training, and 200 responses as develop-
ment set for parameter tuning. Our evaluation data
contains 1500 responses from the same English pro-
ficiency test, which contain the same 24 topics. All
of these data are scored on a 0-4 scale by expert hu-
man raters. In our automated scoring system, we use
a filtering model to identify responses which should
have a score of 0, such as responses with a technical
difficulty (e.g., equipment problems, high ambient
noise), responses containing uncooperative behavior
from the speakers (e.g., non-English speech, whis-
pered speech). So in this paper we only focused on
the responses with scores of 1-4. Statistics for this
data set are shown in Table 1. As the table shows,
the score distributions are similar across the train-
ing, development, and evaluation data sets.
5.2 Speech recognizer
We use an ASR system containing a cross-word
triphone acoustic model trained on approximately
800 hours of spoken responses from the same En-
glish proficiency test mentioned above and a lan-
guage model trained on the corresponding tran-
scripts, which contain a total of over 5 million
words. The Word Error Rate (WER) of this system
on the evaluation data set is 33%.
5.3 Evaluation metric
To measure the quality of the developed features, we
employ a widely used metric, the Pearson correla-
tion coefficient (r). In our experiments, we use the
value of the Pearson correlation between the feature
values and the human proficiency scores for each
spoken response.
5.4 Feature performance on transcripts
In Section 3.1, we introduced three features derived
from the similarity between the test responses and
the training responses for each score point. We first
build the training samples for each topic, and then
compare the test responses with their corresponding
models. Three similarity measures are used for cal-
culating the similarity scores, VSM, LSA, and the
PMI-based method. In order to avoid the impact of
recognition errors, we first evaluate these similarity
methods and content features using the human tran-
scripts. The Pearson correlation coefficients on the
evaluation data set for this experiment are shown in
Table 2. The parameters used during model build-
ing, such as the weights for each score category in
the feature Simcmb and the number of topics k in
LSA, are all tuned on the development set, and ap-
plied directly on the evaluation set.
The correlations show that even the simple vec-
tor space model can obtain a good correlation of
0.48 with the human rater scores. The feature
Simcmb performs the best across almost all the test
setups, since it combines the information from all
score categories. The PMI-based features outper-
form the other two similarity methods when evalu-
ated both on all responses or only on the contextual-
based topics. We also observe that the correlations
on contextual-based tasks are much higher than on
opinion-based tasks. The reason for this is that

the contextual-based tasks are more constrained to
the materials provided with the test item, whereas
the opinion-based tasks are relatively open-ended.
Therefore, it is easier for the similarity measures to
track the content, the topics, or the vocabulary usage
of the contextual-based topics. Overall, the best cor-
relations are obtained using the feature combining
the similarity scores to each score category and the
PMI-based methods to calculate the similarity. Here,
the Pearson correlations are 0.53 for all responses,
and 0.62 for the contextual-based tasks only.
We also investigated whether additional perfor-
mance gains could be achieved by combining infor-
mation from the three different content features to
build a single overall content score, since the three
features may measure disparate aspects of the re-
sponse. The combination model we use is mul-
tiple regression, in which the score assigned to a
test response is estimated as a weighted linear com-
bination of a selected set of features. The fea-
tures are the similarity values to each score category
(Simi, i ? {1, 2, 3, 4}), calcuated using the three
similairty measures. In total we have 12 content
features. The regression model is also built on the
development set, and tested on the evaluation set.
The correlation for the final model is 0.60 on all
responses, which is significantly better than the in-
dividual models (0.48 for VSM, 0.45 for LSA, and
0.53 for PMI). Compared to results reported in pre-
vious work on similar speech scoring tasks but mea-
suring other aspects of speech, our correlation re-
sults are very competitive (Zechner and Xi, 2008;
Zechner et al., 2009).
5.5 Feature Performance on ASR output
The results shown in the previous section were ob-
tained using human transcripts of test responses, and
were reported in order to demonstrate the meaning-
fulness of the proposed features. However, in prac-
tical automated speech scoring systems, the only
available text is the output of the ASR system, which
may contain a large number of recognition errors.
Therefore, in this section we show the performance
of the content features extracted using ASR hy-
potheses. Note that we still use the human tran-
scripts of the training samples to train the models,
the parameter values and the regression weights;
however, we only use ASR output of the evaluation
data for testing the feature performance. These cor-
relations are shown in Table 3.
Compared to the results in Table 2, we find that
the VSM and LSA methods are very robust to recog-
nition errors, and we only observe slight correlation
decreases on these features. However, the decrease
for the PMI-based method is quite large. A possi-
ble reason for this is that this method is based on
word-to-word similarity computed on the training
data, so the mismatch between training and evalu-
ation set likely has a great impact on the computa-
tion of the similarity scores, since we train on human
transcripts, but test using ASR hypotheses. Likely
for the same reason, the regression model combining
all the features does not provide any further contri-
bution to the correlation result (0.44 when evaluated

on all responses).
In Section 4, we proposed using ASR confidence
scores during feature extraction to introduce acous-
tic level information and, thus, penalize responses
for which the ASR output is less likely to be correct.
Under this approach, all similarity scores are mul-
tiplied by the average word confidence score con-
tained in the test response. The performance of these
enhanced features is provided in Table 4. Compared
to the scores in Table 3, the enhanced features per-
form better than the basic features that do not take
the confidence scores into consideration. Using this
approach, we can improve the correlation scores for
most of the features, especially for the PMI-based
features. These features had lower correlations be-
cause of the recognition errors, but with the con-
fidence scores, they outperform the other features
when evaluated both on all responses or only on
contextual-based responses. Note that the correla-
tions for feature Simmax remains the same because
the same average confidence scores for each test re-
sponse is multiplied by the similarity scores to each
of the score points, so the score point obtaining the
highest similarity score is the same whether the con-
fidence scores are considered or not. The correlation
of the regression model also improves from 0.44 to
0.51 when the confidence scores are included. Over-
all, the best correlations for the individual similarity
features with the confidence scores are very close to
those obtained using human transcripts, as shown in
Tables 2 and 4: the difference is 0.53 vs. 0.51 for
all responses, and 0.62 vs. 0.59 for contextual-based
tasks only.
Because all models and parameter values are
trained on human transcripts, this experimental
setup might not be optimal for using ASR outputs.
For instance, the regression model does not outper-
form the results of individual features using ASR
outputs, although the confidence scores help im-
prove the overall correlation scores. We expect that
we can obtain better performance by using a regres-
sion model trained on ASR transcripts, which can
better model the impact of noisy data on the features.
In our future work, we will build sample responses
for each score category, tune the parameter values,
and train the regression model all on ASR hypothe-
ses. We hope this can solve the mismatch problem
during training and evaluation, and can provide us
even better correlation results.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
Most previous work on automated scoring of spon-
taneous speech used features mainly related to low-
level information, such as fluency, pronunciation,
prosody, as well as a few features measuring aspects
such as vocabulary diversity and grammatical accu-
racy. In this paper, we focused on extracting con-
tent features to measure the speech proficiency in
relatively higher-level aspect of spontaneous speech.
Three features were computed to measure the sim-
ilarity between a test response and a set of sam-
ple responses representing different levels of speak-
ing proficiency. The similarity was calculated using
different methods, including the lexical matching
109
method VSM, and two corpus-based semantic simi-
larity measures, LSA and PMI. Our experimental re-
sults showed that all the features obtained good cor-
relations with human proficiency scores if there are
no recognition errors in the text transcripts, with the
PMI-based method performing the best over three
similarity measures. However, if we used ASR tran-
scripts, we observed a marked performance drop for
the PMI-based method. Although we found that
VSM and LSA were very robust to ASR errors, the
overall correlations for the ASR condition were not
as good as using human transcripts. To solve this
problem, we proposed to use ASR confidence scores
to improve the feature performance, and achieved
similar results as when using human transcripts.
As we discussed in Section 5, all models were
trained using human transcripts, which might de-
crease the performance when these models are ap-
plied directly to the ASR outputs. In our future
work, we will compare models trained on human
transcripts and on ASR outputs, and investigate
whether we should use matching data for training
and evaluation, or whether we should not introduce
noise during training in order to maintain the validity
of the models. We will also investigate whether the
content features can provide additional information
for automated speech scoring, and help build better
scoring systems when they are combined with other
non-content features, such as the features represent-
ing fluency, pronunciation, prosody, vocabulary di-
versity information. We will also explore generating
other features measuring the higher-level aspects of
the spoken responses. For example, we can extract
features assessing the responses? relatedness to the
stimulus of an opinion-based task. For contextual-
based tasks, the test takers are asked to read or lis-
ten to some stimulus material, and answer a ques-
tion based on this information. We can build models
using these materials to check the correctness and
relatedness of the spoken responses.
