Abstract 
 
The Copiale cipher is a 105-page enciphered 
book dated 1866.  We describe the features of 
the book and the method by which we 
deciphered it. 
 
1. Features of the Text 
 
Figure 1 shows a portion of an enciphered book 
from the East Berlin Academy.  The book has 
the following features: 
 
? It is 105 pages long, containing about 
75,000 handwritten characters. 
? The handwriting is extremely neat. 
? Some characters are Roman letters (such 
as a and b), while others are abstract 
symbols (such as 1 and <).  Roman 
letters appear in both uppercase and 
lowercase forms. 
? Lines of text are both left- and right-
justified. 
? There are only a few author corrections. 
? There is no word spacing.   
 
There are no illustrations or chapter breaks, but 
the text has formatting: 
 
? Paragraphs are indented. 
? Some lines are centered. 
 
? 
*This material was presented as part of an invited 
talk at the 4th Workshop on Building and Using 
Comparable Corpora (BUCC 2011). 
 
 
? Some sections of text contain a double-
quote mark (?) before each line. 
? Some lines end with full stop (.) or colon 
(:).  The colon (:) is also a frequent 
word-internal cipher letter. 
? Paragraphs and section titles always 
begin with Roman letters (in capitalized 
form). 
 
The only non-enciphered inscriptions in the 
book are ?Philipp 1866? and ?Copiales 3?, the 
latter of which we used to name the cipher. 
The book also contains preview 
fragments (?catchwords?) at the bottom of left-
hand pages.  Each catchword is a copy of the 
first few letters from the following (right-hand) 
page.  For example, in Figure 1, the short 
sequence 3A^ floats at the bottom of the left page, 
and the next page begins 3A^om!...  In early 
printing, catchwords were used to help printers 
validate the folding and stacking of pages. 
 
2. Transcription 
 
To get a machine-readable version of the text, 
we devised the transcription scheme in Figure 2.  
According to this scheme, the line  
 
        >Ojv-</E3CA=/^Ub2Gr@J 
 
is typed as:

The transcription uses easy-to-reach keyboard 
characters, so a transcriber can work without 
taking his/her eyes off the original document.   
There are approximately 90 cipher 
letters, including 26 unaccented Roman letters, 
a-z.  The letters c, h, m, n, p, r, s, and x have 
dotted forms (e.g., C), while the letter i also has 
an un-dotted form.  The letters m, n, r, and u 
have underlined variants (e.g., B), and the 
vowels have circumflexed variants (e.g., A).  The 
plain letter y does not appear unaccented until 
page 30, but it appears quite frequently with an 
umlaut (y).The four Roman letters d, g, n, and z 
appear in both plain (d, g, n, z) and fancy forms 
(L, K, Y, J).  Capitalized Roman letters are used 
to start paragraphs.  We transcribe these with A-
Z, though we down-case them before counting 
frequencies (Section 3).  Down-casing D, G, N, 
and Z is not trivial, due to the presence of both 
plain and fancy lowercase forms.   
The non-Roman characters are an 
eclectic mix of symbols, including some Greek 
letters.  Eight symbols are rendered larger than 
others in the text: 9, @, #, %, 2, *, ?, and ?. 
We transcribed a total of 16 pages 
(10,840 letters).  We carried out our analysis on 
those pages, after stripping catchwords and 
down-casing all Roman letters. 
 
3.  Letter Frequencies and Contexts 
 
Figure 3 shows cipher letter frequencies.  The 
distribution is far from flat, the most frequent 
letter being ^ (occurring 412 times).  Here are 
the most common cipher digraphs (letter pairs) 
and trigraphs, with frequencies: 
? - 99  ? - ^ 47 
C : 66  C : G 23 
- ^ 49  Y ? - 22

transcriptions. 
 
The full digraph counts reveal 
interesting patterns among groups of letters.  For 
example, letters with circumflexes (A, E, I, O, U) 
have behaviors in common: all five tend to be 
preceded by z and >, and all five tend to be 
followed by 3 and j.  To get a better handle on 
letter similarities, we automatically clustered the 
cipher letters based on their contexts.  The result 
is shown in Figure 4.  We did the clustering as 
follows.  For each distinct letter x, we created a

Figure 4.  Automatic clustering of cipher letters 
based on similarity of contexts. 
 
 
co-occurrence vector of length 90, to capture the 
distribution of letters than precede x.  For 
example, if x is preceded 12 times by >, 0 times 
by U, 4 times by y, 1 time by 6, etc, then its 
vector looks like this:  [12, 0, 4, 1, ?].  For the 
same letter x, we created another vector that 
captures the distribution of letters than follow x, 
e.g., [0, 0, 7, 2, ?].  Then we concatenated the 
two vectors to create v(x) = [12, 0, 4, 1, ?, 0, 0, 
7, 2, ?].  We deemed two letters a and b to be 
similar if the cosine distance between v(a) and 
v(b) is small, indicating that they appear in 
similar contexts.  We used the Scipy software 
(http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eads/cluster.html) to 
perform and plot a clustering that incrementally 
merges similar letters (and groups of letters) in a 
bottom-up fashion. 
The cluster diagram confirms that 
circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) behave 
similarly.  It also shows that the unaccented 
Roman letters form a natural grouping, as do 
underlined letters.  Merges that happen low in 
the cluster map indicate very high similarity, e.g., 
the group (y, !, Y). 
 
4. First Decipherment Approach 
 
Building on the self-similarity of Roman letters, 
our first theory was that the Roman letters carry 
all the information in the cipher, and that all 
other symbols are NULLs (meaningless tokens 
added after encipherment to confuse 
cryptanalysis).  If we remove all other symbols, 
the remaining Roman letters indeed follow a 
typical natural language distribution, with the 
most popular letter occurring 12% of the time, 
and the least popular letters occurring rarely. 
The revealed sequence of Roman letters 
is itself nonsensical, so we posited a simple 
substitution cipher.  We carried out automatic 
computer attacks against the revealed Roman-
letter sequence, first assuming German source, 
then English, then Latin, then forty other 
candidate European and non-European 
languages.  The attack method is given in 
[Knight et al 2006].  That method automatically 
combines plaintext-language identification with 
decipherment.  Unfortunately, this failed, as no 
5
language identified itself as a more likely 
plaintext candidate than the others. 
We then gave up our theory regarding 
NULLs and posited a homophonic cipher, with 
each plaintext letter being encipherable by any 
of several distinct cipher letters.  While a well-
executed homophonic cipher will employ a flat 
letter frequency distribution, to confound 
analysis, we guessed that the Copiale cipher is 
not optimized in this regard.   
We confirmed that our computer attack 
does in fact work on a synthetic homophonic 
cipher, i.e., it correctly identifies the plaintext 
language, and yields a reasonable, if imperfect, 
decipherment.  We then loosed the same attack 
on the Copiale cipher.  Unfortunately, all 
resulting decipherments were nonsense, though 
there was a very slight numerical preference for 
German as a candidate plaintext language. 
 
5. Second Decipherment Approach 
 
We next decided to focus on German as the most 
likely plaintext language, for three reasons: 
 
? the book is located in Germany 
? the computer homophonic attack gave a very 
slight preference to German 
? the book ends with the inscription ?Philipp 
1866?, using the German double-p spelling. 
 
Pursuing the homophonic theory, our thought 
was that all five circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, 
U), behaving similarly, might represent the same 
German letter.  But which German letter?  Since 
the circumflexed letters are preceded by z and >, 
the circumflexed letters would correspond to the 
German letter that often follows whatever z and > 
stand for.  But what do they, in turn, stand for? 
From German text, we built a digraph 
frequency table, whose the most striking 
characteristic is that C is almost always followed 
by H.  The German CH pair is similar to the 
English QU pair, but C is fairly frequent in 
German.  A similar digraph table for the cipher 
letters shows that ? is almost always followed by 
-.  So we posited our first two substitutions: ?=C 
and -=H.  We then looked for what typically 
precedes and follows CH in German, and what 
typically precedes and follows ?- in the cipher.  
For example, ?-^ is the most frequent cipher 
trigraph, while CHT is a common German 
trigraph.  We thus hypothesized the further 
substitution ^=T, and this led to a cascade of 
others.  We retracted any hypothesis that 
resulted in poor German digraphs and trigraphs, 
and in this way, we could make steady progress 
(Figure 5).   
The cluster map in Figure 4 was of great 
help.  For example, once we established a 
substitution like y=I, we could immediately add 
Y=I and !=I, because the three cipher letters 
behave so similarly.  In this way, we mapped all 
circumflexed letters (A, E, I, O, U) to plaintext E.  
These leaps were frequently correct, and we 
soon had substitutions for over 50 cipher letters.  
Despite progress, some very frequent 
German trigraphs like SCH were still drastically 
under-represented in our decipherment.  Also, 
many cipher letters (including all unaccented 
Roman letters) still lacked substitution values.  
A fragment of the decipherment thus far looked 
like this (where ??? stands for an as-yet-
unmapped cipher letter): 
 
?GEHEIMER?UNTERLIST?VOR?DIE?GESELLE 
?ERDER?TITUL 
?CEREMONIE?DER?AUFNAHME 
 
On the last line, we recognized the two words 
CEREMONIE and DER separated by a cipher 
letter.  It became clear that the unaccented 
Roman letters serve as spaces in the cipher.  
Note that this is the opposite of our first 
decipherment approach (Section 4).  The non-
Roman letters are not NULLs -- they carry 
virtually all the information.  This also explains 
why paragraphs start with capitalized Roman 
letters, which look nice, but are meaningless. 
We next put our hypothesized 
decipherment into an automatic German-to-
English translator (www.freetranslation.com), 
where we observed that many plaintext words 
were still untranslatable.  For example, 
ABSCHNITL was not recognized as a 
translatable German word.  The final cipher 
letter for this word is colon (:), which we had 
mapped previously to L.  By replacing the final 
L in ABSCHNITL with various letters of the 
alphabet (A-Z), we hit on the recognized word
6
 
Figure 5.  Progress of decipherment.  The main grid shows plaintext (German) letters across the top and 
ciphertext letters down the left side.  The ciphertext letters are grouped into clusters.  To the right of the 
main grid are frequent German trigraphs (der, und, ein, ?) and frequent cipher trigraphs (?-^, C:G, HC|, 
?), with the two columns being separated by hypothesized trigraph decipherments. 
 
ABSCHNITT (translated as ?section?).  We then 
realized that the function of colon (:) is to double 
the previous consonant (whether it be T, L, F, or 
some other letter).  Old German writing uses a 
stroke with the same function. 
The cipher letter T was still unknown, 
appearing in partially deciphered words like 
TAFLNER, TNUPFTUCHS, and GESELLTAFLT.  
We tried substituting each of the letters A-Z for 
T, but this did not yield valid German.  However, 
we found GESELLSCHAFLT in a German 
dictionary, so we concluded that T stands for 
SCH.  This opened the door for other multi-
plaintext-letter substitutions. 
Finally, we brought full native-German 
expertise to bear, by taking hypothesized 
decipherments (hyp) and correcting them (corr): 
 
ey/t+Nc-ZKGQOF~PC|nMYC5]-3Cy/OnQZMEX?g6G

hyp:  beruhre mit der linche  hand dein  
corr:  ber?hre mit der linchen hand dein  
 
This allowed us to virtually complete our table 
of substitutions (Figure 6).  Three cipher letters 
remained ambiguous:  
? [ could represent either SS or S 
? 5 could represent either H or K 
? G could represent either EN or EM  
However, these three symbols are ambiguous 
only with respect to deciphering into modern 
German, not into old German, which used 
different spelling conventions.   
The only remaining undeciphered 
symbols were the large ones: 9, @, #, %, 2, *, 
?, and ?.  These appear to be logograms, 
standing for the names of (doubly secret) people 
and organizations, as we see in this section: ?the 
9 asks him whether he desires to be 2?.

The book describes the initiation of ?DER 
CANDIDAT? into a secret society, some 
functions of which are encoded with logograms.  
Appendix A contains our decipherment of the 
beginning of the manuscript. 
 
7.  Conclusion 
 
We described the Copiale cipher and its 
decipherment.  It remains to transcribe the rest 
of the manuscript and to do a careful translation.  
The document may contain further encoded 
information, and given the amount of work it 
represents, we believe there may be other 
documents using the same or similar schemes.
