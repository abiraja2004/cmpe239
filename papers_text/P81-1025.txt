IS IT USEFUL TO DISTINGUISH PARSING FROM INTERPRETATION? 
S ince  most  of th i s  pos i t ion  paper  v i i i  be a t tack ing  
the  separat ion  of  pars ing  f rom in terpretat ion ,  le t  me 
f i r s t  make i t  c lear  that  I do be l ieve  in  syntact i c  
knowledge.  In  th i s  I am more conservat ive  than  o ther  
researchers  in  in terpretat ion  a t  Berke ley ,  
Carneg ie -Me l lon ,  Co lombia ,  the  un ivers i t ies  o f  
Connect icut  and Mary land ,  and Ya le .  
But be l iev ing  in  syntact i c  knowledge i s  not  the  same 
as  be l iev ing  in  parsers !  The search  fo r  a way to ass ign  
8 syntact i c  s t ructure  to  a sentence  la rge ly  independent  
o f  the  mean ing  o f  that  sentence  has led  to  a te r r ib le  
misd i rec t ion  of  labor .  And th i s  e f fec t  has  been fe l t  on 
both  s ides  of  the  fence .  We f ind  ourse lves  look ing  fo r  
ways to  reduce  in teract ion  between syntax  and semant ics  
as  much as poss ib le .  How far  can  we dr ive  a pure ly  
syntact i c  ( semant ic )  ana lyzer ,  w i thout  sneak ing  over  in to  
the enemy camp? Row well can we disguise syntax 
(semantics) as semantics (syntax)? How narrow a pipe 
between the two can we set away with? What a waste of 
time, when we should be starting with bod ies  of texts, 
considering the total language analysis picture, and 
looking for what kinds of knowledge need to interact to 
unders tand  those  texts .  
I f  our  in tent  in  overextend ins  our  theor ies  was to 
res t  the i r  musc le ,  then  I would  have no qua lms.  Push ing  
a mechan ism down a b l ind  a l ley  i s  an impor tant  way to  
s tudy  i t s  weaknesses. But I rea l ly  can ' t  accept  th i s  
Popper ian  v iew o f  modern computat iona l  l ingu is t i cs .  
Mechanisms are  not  d r iven  beyond the i r  l im i ts  to  f ind  
those  l im i ts ,  but  ra ther  to  grab  ter r i to ry  f rom the  o ther  
side. The underlying premise is "If our mechanism X can 
sometimes do task A, then there is no need for someone 
e lse 's  mechanism Y." Occam's razor is used with murderous 
intent. 
Fur thermore ,  the  debate  over  whether  parsers  make 
sense  has  dras t i ca l ly  reduced in teract ion  between 
researchers .  Each s ide  sees  the  o ther  as  avo id ing  
fundamenta l  i ssues ,  and so the  resu l ts  f rom the  o ther  
s ide  a lways  seem to be bes ide  the  po in t .  For  example ,  
when Mirth Marcus" explains some grmamatical constraint 
as syntact i c  p rocess ing  const ra in ts ,  be doesn ' t  answer  
any of  the  prob lems I 'm faced  w i th .  And I 'm sure  Mi tch  
has  no need fo r  f rame-based ,  domain -dr iven  par t ia l  
l anguage ana lys i s  techn iques .  
Th is  s i tuat ion  has  not  a r i sen  because  we have  been 
fo rced  to  spec ia l i ze .  We s imply  don ' t  know enough to  
qua l i fy  fo r  an in format ion  exp los ion  yet .  Computat iona l  
l ingu is t i cs  doesn ' t  have  hundreds  of  journa ls  in  dozens  
of  languages .  I t ' s  a young f ie ld  w i th  on ly  a handfu l  o f  
peop le  work ing  in  i t .  
Nor i s  i t  the  case  that  we don ' t  have th ings  to  say  
to  each  o ther .  But - -  end here 's  the  rub  - -  some o f  the  
most  use fu l  th ings  that  each  o f  us knows are  the  th ings  
that  we don ' t  dare  te l l .  By that  I mean that  each  of  us 
knows where our  theor ies  fa l l  apar t ,  where ve have  to  
k ludge  the  programs,  fudge  the  inputs ,  o r  w ince  a t  the  
outputs .  That  k ind  o f  in fo rmat ion  cou ld  be inva luab le  
fo r  suggest ing  to  the  o thers  where to  focus  the i r  
a t tent ions .  Unfor tunate ly ,  even i f  we became brave  
enough to ta lk  about ,  even emphas ize ,  where we ' re  hav ing  
prob lems,  the  odds are  low that  we would  cons ider  
acceptab le  what  someone e lse  proposes  as  a so lu t ion .  
IS SIMULATION OF HUMAN PROCESSING IMPORTANT? 
Yes, very much so, even if all you are interested in 
is a good computer program. The reason why was neatly 
captured in ~rinciDles of Artificia~ lnte~lieence: 
" language has  evo lved  as a c~un icat ion  medium between 
i n te l l i aen~ be ings"  (N i l sson ,  p .  2 ) .  That  i s ,  natura l  
language usage  depends  on the  fac t  that  cer ta in  th ings  
can  be le f t  ambiguous ,  le f t  vague,  o r  jus t  le f t  out ,  
because  the  hearer  knows a lmost  as  much as the  speaker .  
Natura l  language has  been f ine ly  tuned to  the  
co - , -un icat ive  needs  o f  human be ings .  We may have to  
adapt  to  the  l im i ta t ions  o f  our  ears  and our  voca l  
chords ,  but  we have o therwise  been the  masters  of  our  
language.  Th is  i s  t rue  even i f  there  i s  an innate  
un iversa l  grmmuar (wh ich  I don ' t  be l ieve  in ) .  A 
un iversa l  grammar app l ies  few const ra in ts  to  our  use  o f  
e l l ips i s ,  ambigu i ty ,  anaphora ,  and a l l  the  o ther  aspects  
o f  language that  make language an e f f i c ient  means fo r  
in fo rmat ion  t rans fer ,  end a pa in  fo r  the  progr - - - -e r .  
Because  language has been f i t ted  to  what  we do best ,  
I be l ieve  i t ' s  improbab le  that  there  ex is t  p rocesses  very  
un l ike  what peop le  use  to  dea l  w i th  i t .  There fore ,  wh i le  
I have  no in tent ion  o f  t ry ing  to  model  react ion  t ime data  
po in ts ,  I do f ind  human behav ior  impor tant  fo r  two k inds  
of  in fo rmat ion .  F i r s t ,  what  do peop le  do we l l ,  how do 
they  do i t ,  and how does  language use  depend on it? 
Second,  what  do peop le  do poor ly ,  and how does  language 
use  get  a round it? 
The quest ion  '~ow can we know what human process ing  
i s  rea l ly  l i ke?"  i s  a non- i ssue .  We don ' t  have to  know 
what  human process ing  i s  rea l ly  l i ke .  But i f  peop le  can 
unders tand  texts  that  leave  out  c ruc ia l  background fac ts ,  
then  our  programs have to  be ab le  to  in fer  those  fac ts .  
I f  peop le  have  t roub le  unders tand ing  in format ion  phrased  
in  cer ta in  ways ,  then  our  programs have to  phrase  i t  in  
ways they  can  unders tand .  At some leve l  o f  descr ip t ion ,  
our  programs w i l l  have  to  be "do ing  what  peop le  do , "  
i .e . ,  f i l l i ng  in cer ta in  k inds  o f  b lanks ,  leav ing  out  
cer ta in  k inds  of  redundanc ies ,  and so on .  But there  i s  
no reason  fo r  computat iona l  l ingu is ts  to  wor ry  about  how 
deep ly  the i r  p rograms cor respond to  human processes .  
WILL PARALLEL PROCESSING CHANGE THINGS? 
People have been predicting (and waiting for) great 
benefits from parallelism for some time. Personally, I 
believe that most of the benefits will come in the area 
of  in terpretat ion ,  where la rge-sca le  memory search ,  such  
as  Scot t  Fahlman has  been worry ing  about ,  a re  invo lved .  
And,  i f  anyth ing ,  improvements  in  the  use  o f  semant ics  
w i l l  decrease  the  a t t rac t iveness  o f  syntact i c  pars ing .  
But I a l so  th ink  that  there  are  not  that  many ga ins  
to  be had from para l le l  p rocess ing .  Hash cod ings ,  
d i sc r iminat ion  t rees ,  and so on ,  a l ready  y ie ld  reasonab ly  
constant  speeds  fo r  look ing  up data .  I t  i s  an 
inconven ience  to  have  to  dea l  w i th  such  th ings ,  but  not  
an insurmountab le  obstac le .  Our rea l  p rob lems at  the  
moment are  how to  get  our  sys tems to  make dec is ions ,  such  
as  " I s  the  quest ion  "How many t imes  has  John asked  you 
fo r  money?" rhetor i ca l  o r  not?"  We are  l im i ted  not  by the  
number of  p rocessors ,  but  by not  knowing how to do the  
job.

TtI.~E LINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE 
HAVE OUR TOOLS AFFECTED US? 
Yes,  and adverse ly .  To par t ia l l y  cont rad ic t  my 
s ta tements  in the  las t  paragraph,  we 've  been over ly  
concerned w i th  how to do th ings  w i th  ex is t ing  hardware  
and so f tware .  And we 've  been too impressed  by the  
success  computer  sc ience  has  had w i th  syntax-dr iven  
compi la t ion  of  p rogramming languages .  I1 i s  cer ta in ly  
t rue  that  work on grammars ,  parsers ,  code generators ,  and 
so on ,  have  changed compi le r  generat ion  f rom maes ive  
mul t i -man-year  endeavors  to  s tudent  course  pro jec ts .  I f  
compi le r  techno logy  has  benef i ted  so much f rom syntact i c  
parsers ,  why can ' t  computat iona l  l ingu is t i cs?  
The prob lem here  is that  the  techno logy  has  not  done 
what  peop le  th ink  i t  has .  I t  has  a l lowed us to  deve lop  
modern ,  we l l - s t ruc tured ,  task -or iented  languages ,  but  i t  
has  not  g iven  us natura l  ones .  Anyone who has  had co 
teach  an in t roductory  progru~ing  course  knows that .  
H igh- leve l  languages ,  though eas ie r  to l earn  than  mach ine  
language,  a re  very  d i f fe rent  f rom human languages ,  such  
as English or Chinese. 
Programming languages ,  to  read jus t  N i l sson 's  quote ,  
a re  deve loped fo r  c~un icat ion  between morons .  A l l  the  
useful features of language, such  as ellipsis and 
ambigu i ty ,  have  to  be e l iminated  in  o rder  co use  the  
techno logy  of  syntax-dr iven  pars ing .  Compi le rs  do not  
point the way for computational linguistics. They show 
instead what we get  if we restrict ourselves to 
simplistic methods. 
DO WE PARSE CONTEXT-FREELY? 
My work ing  assumpt ion  i s  that  the  syntact i c  
knowledge used  in  comprehens ion  i s  a t  most  context - f ree  
and probab ly  a lo t  less ,  because  o f  memory l im i ta t ions .  
Th is  i s  most ly  a resu l t  o f  semant ic  heur i s t i cs  tak ing  
over  when const ruct ions  become too  complex  fo r  our  
cogn i t ive  chunk ing  capac i t ies .  But th i s  i s  not  a 
critical assumpt ion  for me. 
; ~rE~AC'~ ONS 
S ince  I don ' t  be l ieve  in  the  pure  gran~at ica l  
approach ,  I have  to  rep lace  th i s  las t  set of  quest ions  
w i th  quest ions  about  the  re la t ionsh ip  between our  
knowledge ( l ingu is t i c  and o therwise)  and the  procedures  
fo r  app ly ing  i1 .  For tunate ly ,  the  quest ions  s t i l l  make 
sense  a f te r  th i s  subst i tu t ion .  
DO OUR ALGORITHMS AFFECT OUR KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES? 
Of course .  In  fac t ,  i t  i s  o f ten  hard  to  dec ide  
whether  some feature  o f  a sys tem i s  a knowledge s t ructure  
or  a procedura l  fac tor .  For  example ,  i s  l inear  search  a 
resu l t  o f  data  s t ructures  or  p rocedure  des igns?  
CAN WE TEST ALGORITHMS/KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES SEPARATELY? 
We do indeed t ry  exper iments  based  on the  shape of  
knowledge s t ructures ,  independent ly  o f  bow they  are  used  
(but  I th ink  that  most  such  exper iments  have  been 
inconc lus ive) .  I 'm not  sure  what  i t  wou ld  mean,  however ,  
fo r  a procedure  to  be va l idated  independent ly  o f  the  
knowledge s t ructures  i t  works  w i th ,  s ince  unt i l  the  
knowledge s t ructures  were  r ight ,  you  cou ldn ' t  te l l  i f  the  
procedure  was do ing  the  r ight  th ing  or  not .  
WHY DO WE SEPARATE RECOGNITION AND PRODUCTION? 
I f  I were t ry ing  to  dea l  w i th  th i s  quest io  n on 
Er ra t i ca l  g rounds ,  I wou ldn ' t  know what  i t  meant .  
Cr~ars  a re  not  p rocesses  and hence  have  no d i rec t ion .  
They are  abst ract  character i za t ions  o f  the  set  o f  
we l l - fo rmed s t r ings .  From cer ta in  c lasses  o f  g ra -w-ars  
106 
one can mechan ica l ly  bu i ld  recogn izers  and rando~ 
generators .  But such  mach ines  are  not  the  gra -~ars ,  and 
a recogn izer  i s  man i fes t ly  not  the  same mach ine  as a 
generator ,  even though the  same grammar may under l ie  
both. 
Suppose  ve rephrase  the  quest ion  as  '~hy  do we have  
separate  knowledge s t ructures  fo r  in terpretat ion  and 
product ion?"  Th is  p resupposes  that  there  are  separate  
knowledge s t ructures ,  and in  our  cur rent  systems th i s  is  
on ly  par t ia l l y  t rue .  
In terpret ing  and product ion  programs abound in ad 
hoc procedures  that  share  very  l i t t le  in  common near  the  
language end.  The in terpreters  a re  fu l l  o f  methods  fo r  
guessing at  mean ings ,  filling in the  b lanks ,  p red ic t ing  
l i ke ly  fo l low-ups ,  and  so on .  The generators  a re  fu l l  o f  
methods  fo r  e l iminat ing  contextua l  i tems,  p ick ing  
appropr ia te  descr ip tors ,  choos ing  pronouns ,  and so on .  
Each has  a very  d i f fe rent  set  of  p rob lems to  dea l  w i th .  
On the  o ther  hand,  our  in terpreters  and generators  
do share  what we th ink  i s  the  impor tant  s tu f f ,  the  wor ld  
knowledge,  w i thout  wh ich  a l l  the  o ther  process ing  
wou ldn ' t  be wor th  a par t r idge  in  a parse  t ree .  The wor ld  
knowledge says  what  makes sense  in  onders tand ins  and what 
i s  impor tant  to  ta lk  about .  
Par t  of  the  separat ion  of  in terpretat ion  and 
generat ion  occurs  when the  programs fo r  each  are  
deve loped by d i f fe rent  peop le .  Th is  Tesu l ts  in  
unrea l i s t i c  sys tems that  wr i te  what  they  can ' t  read  and 
read  what they  can ' t  wr i te .  Someday we ' l l  have  a good 
model o f  how knowledge the  in terpreter  ga ins  about  
unders tand ing  a new word i s  conver ted  to  knowledge the  
generator  can  use  to  va l id ly  p ick  that  word in  
product ion .  Th is  v i i i  have  account  fo r  how we can  
in terpret  words  w i thout  be ing  ready  to  use  them.  
For  example ,  f rom a sentence  l i ke  "The car  swerved  
o f f  the  road  and s t ruck  a br idge  abutment , "  we can  in fer  
that  an abutment  i s  a noun descr ib ing  some k ind  o f  
outdoor  phys ica l  ob jec t ,  a t tachab le  to  a br idge .  Th is  
would  be enough fo r  in terpretat ion ,  but  obv ious ly  the  
generator  w i l l  need co know more about  what  an abutment  
i s  be fore  i t  cou ld  conf ident ly  say  "Oh,  look  a t  the  cute  
abutment!" 
A f ina l  po in t  on shar ing .  There  are  two s tandard  
arguments  fo r  shar ing  a t  leas t  g r=mmat ica l  in fo rmat ion .  
One i s  to  save  space ,  and the  o ther  i s  to  mainta in  
cons is tency .  Wi thout  c la iming  that  shar ing  doesn ' t  
occur ,  I wou ld  l i ke  to  po in t  out  that  both  arguments  a re  
very  weak .  F i r s t ,  there  i s  rea l ly  not  a lo t  o f  
g rammat ica l  knowledge,  compared  aga ins t  a l l  the  o ther  
knowledge we have  about  the  wor ld ,  so not  that  much space  
would  be saved i f  shar ing  occur red .  Second,  i f  the  
generator  der ives  i t ' s  l ingu is t i c  knowledge f rom the  
parser ' s  data  base ,  then  we ' l l  have  as  much cons is tency  
as  we cou ld  measure  in  peop le  anyway.
