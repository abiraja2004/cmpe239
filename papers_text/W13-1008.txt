Abstract
Cliche?s, as trite expressions, are predom-
inantly multiword expressions, but not all
MWEs are cliche?s. We conduct a prelimi-
nary examination of the problem of determin-
ing how cliche?d a text is, taken as a whole, by
comparing it to a reference text with respect
to the proportion of more-frequent n-grams, as
measured in an external corpus. We find that
more-frequent n-grams are over-represented
in cliche?d text. We apply this finding to the
?Eumaeus? episode of James Joyce?s novel
Ulysses, which literary scholars believe to be
written in a deliberately cliche?d style.
1 Cliche?s
In the broadest sense a cliche? is a tired, overused,
unoriginal idea, whether it be in music, in the vi-
sual arts, in the plot of a novel or drama, or in the
language of literature, journalism, or rhetoric. Here,
we are interested only in cliche?s of linguistic form.
Cliche?s are overused, unoriginal expressions that ap-
pear in a context where something more novel might
have reasonably been expected, or which masquer-
ade as something more original, more novel, or more
creative than they actually are. A cliche? is a kind of
ersatz novelty or creativity that is, ipso facto, unwel-
come or deprecated by the reader. Cliche?s appear to
be intuitively recognized by readers, but are difficult
to define more formally.
Cliche?s are predominantly multiword expressions
(MWEs) and are closely related to the idea of formu-
laic language, which for Wray (2002, 2008, summa-
rized in 2009) is a psycholinguistic phenomenon: a
formula is stored and retrieved as a single prefabri-
cated unit, without deeper semantic analysis, even if
it is made up of meaningful smaller units and regard-
less of whether it is or isn?t semantically transparent.
She demonstrates that formulaic language is a het-
erogeneous phenomenon, encompassing many types
of MWEs including fixed expressions (Sag et al,
2002, e.g., whys and wherefores), semi-fixed expres-
sions (e.g., hoist with/by his own petard ?injured
by that with which he would injure others?), and
syntactically-flexible expressions (e.g., sb1 haul sb2
over the coals ?reprimand severely?, allowing also
the passive sb2 was hauled over the coals (by sb1)).
Formulaic language can exhibit any of the types of
idiomaticity required by Baldwin and Kim (2010)
for an expression to be considered an MWE, i.e.,
lexical (de rigueur), syntactic (time and again), se-
mantic (fly off the handle ?lose one?s temper?), prag-
matic (nice to see you), and statistical idiomaticity
(which many of the previous examples also exhibit).
Another theme relating formulaic language to
MWEs is that of a common or preferred (though
not necessarily invariable) way for native speakers to
express an idea, i.e., institutionalization; for exam-
ple, felicitations to someone having a birthday are
usually expressed as happy birthday or (largely in
British English) many happy returns rather than any
of the many other semantically similar possibilities
(#merry birthday; cf. merry Christmas).
However, formulaic language, including cliche?s,
goes beyond the typical view of MWEs in that it
has a cultural aspect as well as a purely linguis-
tic aspect, as it includes catchphrases and allusions
to language in popular culture, such as well-known
52
lines from songs, jokes, advertisements, books, and
movies (curiouser and curiouser from Lewis Car-
roll?s Alice?s Adventures in Wonderland; go ahead,
make my day ?I dare you to attack me or do some-
thing bad, for if you do I will take great pleasure in
defeating and punishing you? from the 1983 Clint
Eastwood movie Sudden Impact).
Furthermore, not all formulaic language is
cliche?d; a weather forecast, for example, has no pre-
tensions of being linguistically creative or original,
but it would be a mistake to think of it as cliche?d,
no matter how formulaic it might be. Conversely,
a cliche? might not be formulaic from Wray?s psy-
cholinguistic perspective ? stored and recognized
as a single unit ? even if its occurrence is at least
frequent enough in relevant contexts for it to be rec-
ognized as familiar, trite, and unoriginal.
Finally, not all MWEs are cliche?s. Verb?particle
constructions such as look up (?seek information in
a resource?) and clear out are common expressions,
but aren?t unoriginal in the sense of being tired and
over-used. Moreover, they are not attempts at cre-
ativity. On the other hand, cliche?s are typically
MWEs. Some particularly long cliche?s, however,
are more prototypical of proverbs than MWEs (e.g.,
the grass is always greener on the other side). Sin-
gle words can also be trite and over-used, although
this tends to be strongly context dependent.
This paper identifies cliche?s as an under-studied
problem closely related to many issues of interest
to the MWE community. We propose a preliminary
method for assessing the degree to which a text is
cliche?d, and then show how such a method can con-
tribute to literary analysis. Specifically, we apply
this approach to James Joyce?s novel Ulysses to of-
fer insight into the ongoing literary debate about the
use of cliche?s in this work.
2 Related work
Little research in computational linguistics has
specifically addressed cliche?s. The most relevant
work is that of Smith et al (2012) who propose a
method for identifying cliche?s in song lyrics, and
determining the extent to which a song is cliche?d.
Their method combines information about rhymes
and the df-idf of trigrams (tf-idf, but using docu-
ment frequency instead of term frequency) in song
lyrics. However, this method isn?t applicable for our
goal of determining how cliche?d an arbitrary text is
with a focus on literary analysis, because in this case
rhyming is not a typical feature of the texts. More-
over, repetition in song lyrics motivated their df-idf
score, but this is not a salient feature of the texts we
consider.
In his studies of cliche?s in Ulysses, Byrnes (2012)
has drawn attention to the concept of the cliche? den-
sity of a text, i.e., the number of cliche?s per unit
of text (e.g., 1000 words). Byrnes manually iden-
tified cliche?s in Ulysses, but given a comprehensive
cliche? lexicon, automatically measuring cliche? den-
sity appears to be a straightforward application of
MWE identification ? i.e., determining which to-
kens in a text are part of an MWE. Although much
research on identification has focused on specific
kinds of MWEs (Baldwin and Kim, 2010), whereas
cliche?s are a mix of types, simple regular expres-
sions could be used to identify many fixed and semi-
fixed cliche?s. Nevertheless, an appropriate cliche?
lexicon would be required for this approach. More-
over, because of the relationship between cliche?s
and culture, to be applicable to historical texts, such
as for the literary analysis of interest to us, a lexicon
for the appropriate time period would be required.
Techniques for MWE extraction could potentially
be used to (semi-) automatically build a cliche? lex-
icon. Much work in this area has again focused
on specific types of MWEs ? e.g., verb?particle
constructions (Baldwin, 2005) or verb?noun com-
binations (Fazly et al, 2009) ? but once more the
heterogeneity of cliche?s limits the applicability of
such approaches for extracting them. Methods based
on strength of association ? applied to n-grams
or words co-occurring through some other relation
such as syntactic dependency (see Evert, 2008, for
an overview) ? could be applied to extract a wider
range of MWEs, although here most research has
focused on two-word co-occurrences, with consid-
erably less attention paid to longer MWEs. Even
if general-purpose MWE extraction were a solved
problem, methods would still be required to distin-
guish between MWEs that are and aren?t cliche?s.

3 Cliche?-density of known-cliche?d text
Frequency per se is not a necessary or defining crite-
rion of formulaic language. Wray (2002) points out
that even in quite large corpora, many undoubted in-
stances of formulaic language occur infrequently or
not at all; for example, Moon (1998) found that for-
mulae such as kick the bucket and speak for your-
self! occurred zero times in her 18 million?word
representative corpus of English. Nevertheless in
a very large corpus we?d expect a formulaic ex-
pression to be more frequent than a more-creative
expression suitable in the same context. Viewing
cliche?s as a type of formulaic language, we hypoth-
esized that a highly-cliche?d text will tend to contain
more n-grams whose frequency in an external cor-
pus is medium or high than a less-cliche?d text of the
same size.
We compared a text known to contain many
cliche?s to more-standard text. As a highly-
cliche?d text we created a document consisting
solely of a sample of 1,988 cliche?s from a web-
site (clichesite.com) that collects them.1 For a
reference ?standard? text we used the written por-
tion of the British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard,
2000). But because a longer text will tend to contain
a greater proportion of low-frequency n-gram types
(as measured in an external corpus) than a shorter
text, it is therefore crucial to our analysis that we
compare equal-size texts. We down-sampled our
reference text to the same size as our highly-cliche?d
text, by randomly sampling sentences.
For each 1?5-gram type in each document (i.e.,
in the sample of cliche?s and in the sample of sen-
tences from the BNC), we counted its frequency in
an external corpus, the Web 1T 5-gram Corpus (Web
1T, Brants and Franz, 2006). Histograms for the fre-
quencies are shown in Figure 1. The x-axis is the
log of the frequency of the n-gram in the corpus,
and the y-axis is the proportion of n-grams that had
that frequency. The dark histogram is for the sam-
ple from the BNC, and the light histogram is for the
cliche?s; the area where the two histograms overlap is
medium grey. For 1-grams, the two histograms are
quite similar; hence the following observations are
1Because we don?t know the coverage of this resource, it
would not be appropriate to use it for an MWE-identification
approach to measuring cliche?-density.
not merely due to simple differences in word fre-
quency. For the 3?5-grams, the light areas show that
the cliche?s contain many more n-gram types with
medium or high frequency in Web 1T than the sam-
ple of sentences from the BNC. For each of the 3?5-
grams, the types in the sample of cliche?s are signif-
icantly more frequent than those in the BNC using
a Wilcoxon rank sum test (p  0.001). The his-
togram for the 2-grams, included for completeness,
is beginning to show the trend observed for the 3?5-
grams, but there is no significant difference in mean
frequency in this case.
This finding supports our hypothesis that cliche?d
text contains more higher-frequency n-grams than
standard text. In light of this finding, in the follow-
ing section we apply this n-gram?based analysis to
the study of cliche?s in Ulysses.
4 Assessing cliche?-density for literary
analysis
Ulysses, by James Joyce, first published in 1922, is
generally regarded as one of the greatest English-
language novels of the twentieth century. It
is divided into 18 episodes written in widely
varying styles and genres. For example, some
episodes are, or contain, long passages of stream-
of-consciousness thought of one of the characters;
another is written in catechism-style question-and-
answer form; some parts are relatively conventional.
Byrnes (2010, 2012) points out that it has long
been recognized that, intuitively, some parts of the
novel are written in deliberately formulaic, cliche?d
language, whereas some other parts use novel, cre-
ative language. However, this intuitive impression
had not previously been empirically substantiated.
Byrnes took the simple step of actually counting the
cliche?s in four episodes of the book and confirmed
the intuition. In particular, he found that the ?Eu-
maeus? episode contained many more cliche?s than
the other episodes considered. However, these re-
sults are based on a single annotator identifying the
cliche?s ? Byrnes himself ? working with an infor-
mal definition of the concept, and possibly biased
by expected outcomes. By automatically and objec-
tively measuring the extent to which ?Eumaeus? is
cliche?d, we can offer further evidence ? of a very
different type ? to this debate.
54
Figure 1: Histograms for the log frequency of n-grams in a sample of sentences from the BNC and a collection of
known cliche?s. 1?5-grams are shown from left to right, top to bottom.
We compared ?Eumaeus? to a background text
consisting of episodes 1?2 and 4?10 of Ulysses,
which are not thought to be written in a marked
style. Because formulaic language could vary over
time, we selected an external corpus from the time
period leading up to the publication of Ulysses ?
the Google Books NGram Corpus (Michel et al,
2011) for the years 1850?1910 (specifically, the
?English 2012? version of this corpus). We down-
sampled each episode, by randomly sampling sen-
tences, to the size of the smallest, to ensure that we
compared equal-size texts.
Figures 2 and 3 show histograms for the fre-
quencies in the external corpus of the 1?5-grams
in ?Eumaeus? and in the background episodes. If
?Eumaeus? is more-cliche?d than the background
episodes, then, given our results in Section 3 above,
we would expect it to contain more high-frequency
higher-order n-grams. We indeed observe this in the
histograms for the 3- and 4-grams. The differences
for each of the 3?5-grams are again significant us-
ing Wilcoxon rank sum tests (p 0.001 for 3- and
4-grams, p < 0.005 for 5-grams), although the ef-
fect is less visually striking than in the analysis in
Section 3, particularly for the 5-grams. One possi-
ble reason for this difference is that in the analysis
in Section 3 the known-cliche?d text was artificial in
the sense that it was a list of expressions, as opposed
to natural text.
We further compared the mean frequency of the
3-, 4-, and 5-grams in ?Eumaeus? to that of each in-
dividual background episode, again down-sampling
by randomly sampling sentences, to ensure that
equal-size texts are compared. In each case we find
that the mean n-gram frequency is highest in ?Eu-
maeus?. These results are consistent with Byrnes?s
finding that ?Eumaeus? is written in a cliche?d style.
5 Conclusions
Cliche?s are an under-studied problem in computa-
tional linguistics that is closely related to issues of
interest to the MWE community. In our prelimi-
nary analysis, we showed that a highly-cliche?d text
contains more higher-frequency n-gram types than a
more-standard text. We then applied this approach
to literary analysis, confirming beliefs about the use
of cliche?s in the ?Eumaeus? episode of Ulysses.
