THE FkEQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ENGLISH SYNTAGMS 
J.. INTRODUCTION 
People use language principally as a means of communication, 
each language community determining the scope of the particular 
language it uses. Within the language, various sets and subsets may 
exist depending upon regional and social differences. Most studies of 
such subsets have been concerned with lexical variations. In this paper, 
a methodology is outlined by which the frequency usage of syntactic 
structures can be measured for subsets of a language, and for a language 
as a whole. 
In order to establish omogeneity features within a subset, reliance is 
made on calculations of chisquare on batches of sentences within the 
subset. Before considering whether or not a more sensitive test should 
be applied to detect significant differences within and among subsets 
of a language, it seemed advisable to determine the frequency distri- 
bution of syntagms throughout particular genres. An extension of the 
methodology to accomplish this objective is described and the results 
for one type of syntactic structure within one genre are tabulated. These 
results indicate that the frequency distribution of syntagms within these 
limitations approximates to a Poisson distribution. 
2. METHODOLOGY 
There are five main steps in the methodology: the isolation of 
each and every syntagm in the corpus of sentences; the assembly of 
the isolated syntagms into a matrix, each row of which contains yn- 
Acknowledgements. The author wishes to thank his colleagues in the Departments of
Information Science and Mathematical Statistics at Monash University, and the staff 
of the Monash University Computer Centre for assistance and advice.

tagms having the same head-character; the comparison, for particular 
syntagms, of the frequencies with which the syntagms occur in different 
genres; the record-keeping of the quantities of sentences in which 
particular syntagms occur once, twice,...n times; and the comparison 
of those quantities with standard statistical distributions. 
The first step in the isolation of the syntagms is the transcription 
of the syntactic structure of the sentences into linearized form, prepar- 
atory to their being used in the computer. 
A criterion used for the selection of a grammar on which to base 
the syntactic structure description was that, for purposes additional to 
those required for this investigation, amely the support of remedial 
English-teaching courses, a manual system of parsing had to be pro- 
vided for use by other users reasonably familiar with traditionally- 
accepted terminology. The methodology was designed to provide a 
means whereby comparisons of genres for frequency-usage of syntac- 
tic structures could be made, so that teaching courses for particular 
genres could emphasize the structures most frequendy used in those 
genres. 
The methodology had to be such that users quite unfamiliar with 
computer techniques could prepare the data in suitable form for feed- 
ing into the computer, and use prepared programs to obtain the nec- 
essary results. 
For the above reasons, a dependency grammar was selected, details 
of which are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

Fig. 1. Wiswesser Line Notation 
The method for linearizing syntactic trees, such as those shown 
typically in Fig. 2, was based on the line-formula chemical notation 
developed by W. J. Wiswesser (W. j. Wlswmsn~, 1954; E. G. SMITH, 
1968). The simple rules applying to the Beebe line notation are that

Fig. 2 (b). Typical Linearization of a Sentence 
starting from the first character of a sentence group such as the subject 
group, verb group, or object group, and proceeding from the hftmost 
path of the tree, characters are recorded in sequential order until a 
termination of a branch of the tree is reached. At that point, a return 
to the nearest branching point in the tree is made, recording a dash 
for each step retraced from the terminating point o the branching point. 
The next leftmost path is then followed with the same retracing proc- 
12 1L~LPH D. BEEBE 
ess until all the paths in the group have been followed to their termina- 
tions. A boundary-marker is then inserted in the linearization to mark 
the boundary between the subject group and the verb group, and the 
procedure repeated for the verb group until all the paths in that group 
have similarly been followed. Another boundary marker is then insert- 
ed in the linearization, and the next group is then processed until the 
end of the sentence has been reached.

The data is then key-punched in the following sequence: a header 
card for the number and title of the batch of sentences; a card for the 
natural text of the sentence; a card for the linearization. 
This data is then fed into the computer, where it is processed by 
a very simple program which contains the following instructions: 
read the characters in the linearization one by one, and if the first char- 
acter is alphabetical, prepare a record string commencing with the 
numeral 1. If the next character in the linearization is also alphabetical, 
increment this numeral by one and enter the result in the next position 
in the record string. Continue so doing until a dash is met. For a dash, 
reduce the numeral by one, and for a group boundary marker, record 
a zero. The effect of this program is to produce for each sentence a
record string of numerals, as shown in Fig. 2, corresponding to the 
level numbers of the nodes in the syntactic tree. 
THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ENGLISH SYNTAGMS 13 
The header card, the natural text card, and the linearization card 
are then transferred to magnetic tape records together with the numer- 
ical record string representing the assignment of the levels. These 
records are then available for calling upon for processing for the iso- 
lation of the syntagms. 
The isolation procedure commences by first drawing the records 
of the linearizations, one at a time, into an array, while at the same 
time drawing the corresponding record of level numbers into another 
array. Both arrays are then scanned simultaneously under the following 
conditions: each character of the linearization is transferred as it is 
scanned, to a further array, while the level numbers corresponding to
the characters are checked until a number is encountered less in value 
than the number of the first character in the linearization. The trans- 
ferred string of characters then represents the syntagm which has 
been isolated. 
The scanning process is then repeated starting from the next char- 
acter in the linearization until the next syntagm has been isolated. 
The procedure is continued starting from successive characters in the 
linearization until all the characters in the linearization have been proc- 
essed. 
As they are produced, the isolated syntagms are fed into the appro- 
priate rows of a matrix, so that each row contains only syntagms having 
the same head character. Before each syntagm is entered into a row of 
the matrix, the previous entries in that row are scanned to see if a sim- 
ilar syntagm has already been entered. Only when there has been 
no previous entry of a similar syntagm, is a new syntagm entered in 
that row. If there has been a similar entry, a frequency count adjacent 
to the entry is incremented by one. 
Optionally, each new entry can have an additional entry inserted 
adjacent to it of the dominant node in the syntactic tree. The depth 
of the syntagm, calculated by subtracting the level of the head character 
from the maximum level of the syntagm, isalso entered, as is the length, 
calculated by adding the number of characters, including dashes, in 
the line notation for the syntagm. 
A control feature is included, which permits the matrix either to 
be cleared at the end of a batch, or to stay filled so that syntagms from 
successive batches of the same genre can be added, to produce cumula- 
tive results. 
Kows of the matrix can be selectively printed. 
At the end of a run, a summary of the entries in each row of the 
14 RALPH D. BEEBE 
matrix is made. The type/token ratio is calculated by dividing the 
number of discrete entries by the total number of syntagms in the 
row.  
Graphic plotting programs have been written to display scatter 
diagrams of length against depth, of quantities of discrete and of to- 
tal syntagms against quantity of sentences, and of type/token ratios 
against quantity of sentonces. See Figs. 3 and 4.

A refinement of the parsing allows the inclusion of left and right 
arrowheads to display departures from arbitrarily-selected norms of 
the linear order of the words of the natural text. Comparisons of quan- 
tities of syntagms with and without such arrowheads provide measures 
of the actual departures from the norms, and thereby provide an evalu- 
ation of the validity of the norms. The levels-assignment program 
contains a provision for not changing the level when scanning a sub- 
categorization number or an arrowhead. 
As each syntagm is isolated and fed into the matrix, a corresponding 
entry is made in a duplicate matrix, this second entry containing the 
number of times that the syntagm has been found in the one sentence. 
When the end of the sentence has been reached, there is also entered 
at that point in the second matrix an adjacent entry of an increment 
in an array at a position corresponding to the number of times that 
the syntagm was found in that sentence. The second matrix therefore 
contains a growing record of the number of sentences in which the 
syntagm appears once, twice .... n times. 
From preliminary investigations, it was found that n rarely exceed- 
ed ten. The provision of an array with fourteen elements was therefore 
ample for the keeping of such records. 
Usage frequencies extracted from the first matrix can be used as 
input data for a chisquare calculation program to ascertain the homo- 
geneity of usage within a batch of sentences, or to find if there are sig- 
nificant differences between genres. See Tables 3-6.

3. RESULTS 
No significant differences were found in the relative proportions 
of particular syntagms (prepositional phrases, in the cases displayed) 
among Batches 1-10 of one genre (newspaper editorials), although 
differences ignificant at the .05 level were noted among Batches 11-20 
of the same genre. When the totals for each group of ten batches were 
compared, however, there were no significant differences. 
Four batches of another genre, Higher School Certificate Exami- 
nation (University Entrance) Essays, produced no significant differences 
within the genre, but did produce significant differences at the .01 
level when compared with tile same number of sentences from the 
previous genre. 
It appears from the results obtained that the frequency usage of 
syntactic structures is a valid criterion of distinctiveness, and can be 
used as a means of comparing enres. 
The entries in the second matrix give the frequency distribution 
of each syntagm within the corpus. See Table 7.

Comparisons of specimen syntagms (prepositional phrases) are given 
in Table 8. It will be observed that the actual distributions are almost 
exactly in conformity with the distributions expected from a Poisson 
distribution. 
9.0 RALPH D. BEEBE 
This study must be considered as a pilot study to prove the meth- 
odology. Further processing of a much larger corpus will no doubt 
reveal more illuminating results.
