In t roduct ion  and abst rac t  
Weather forecasts were early noted 
to be a domain where automatic 
translation was possible (Kittredge, 
1973). Everybody in the field knows 
that there is a computer in Montreal 
translat ing forecasts routinely be- 
tween French and English (METEO). 
The weather domain has proven to 
be a fruitful domain for further 
research as witnessed e.g. by the 
system for generat ing  mar ine  
forecasts presented by Kittredge et 
al (1986), by the work by Goldberg 
et al(1988), by the system gene- 
rating publ ic  weather reports in 
Bulgarian reported on by Mitkov 
(1991) and the system translating 
F inn ish  mar ine  fo recasts  into 
Swedish by Bl~tberg (1988). 
The Swedish Weathra system 
to be presented in this paper 
explores the language and semantics 
of weather forecasts further and it 
aims at deep comprehens ion of 
forecasts.  Beside grammatical  re- 
presentations, Weathra uses repre- 
sentations of the meteorological raw 
facts and secondary facts, e.g. the 
fact that it will probably rain at a 
place where there is a low pressure 
area. It uses a representat ion of 
meteoro log ica l  objects with their 
properties as frames in a data base 
and graphic representation with tile 
standard meteorological icons on a 
map, e.g. icons for sun, cloudy, rain, 
snow,  thunders torm,  wester ly  
winds, L(ow) and H(igh) pressure, 
temperatures, e.g. 10-15. Weathra 
also features a dynamic discourse 
representat ion  inc lud ing  the 
discourse objects which may be 
referred to by the words and 
anaphora in the text (cf Karttunen, 
1976, Johnson & Kay, 1990). The 
discourse objects are regarded as 
instances of the (proto)types or 
(concepts), which are also available 
as frames in a database. 
The formal grammar, morpho- 
logy and lexicon of Weathra are 
based on exper ience  from the 
machine translation system Swetra 
(Sigurd & Gawronska, 1988), which 
is also written in Prolog (LPA 
MacProlog).  The Weathra system 
can understand weather forecasts in 
a fair ly deep sense, depict  its 
comprehension in a map, answer 
questions about the main contents 
and consequences, translate English 
forecasts into Swedish ones and vice 
versa, and generate various forecast 
texts in English or Swedish.

The language of forecasts 
Even a quick glance at the weather 
forecasts in newspapers hows that 
they are written in a special format 
beside using a restricted vocabulary 
(the METEO system uses some 1000 
words, and so does Weathra). There 
are in fact two basic styles in the 
forecasts: the telegraphic style 
illustrated by Sun; Cloudy; Windy; 
Cool; Morning fog; Thunderstorms in
the coastal areas; High 20, Low 15; 
Westerly winds; Snow over Alps; 
Visibility moderate; Cloudy, little 
rain at first, brighter later and a 
normal descriptive style illustrated 
by A low pressure area is moving 
towards Scandinavia. It is expected 
to reach Norway in the afternoon. 
There is, in fact, also an informal 
personalized style which may be 
illustrated by the following quotes 
from a British newspaper (the 
European): 
Players in the Rugby League test 
match between Great Britain and 
Australia on Saturday may need 
longer studs and safe hands to 
tackle the tricky conditions at 
London 's  Wembley  stadium. 
Sunseekers looking to top up their 
tan need look no further than 
southern Spain. 
The Weathra system is primarily 
designed to treat the telegraphic 
and the descriptive styles. 
The grammar of forecasts 
Weathra includes two grammars 
motivated by the distinction 
between te legraphic weather 
phrases and full sentences. 
Interestingly enough the gramma- 
tical categories of the two kinds of 
expressions differ. The telegraphic 
phrase grammar can work with a 
superordinate category called 
nominal which includes both nouns 
and adjectives. The noun phrases 
used in telegraphic grammar may 
be somewhat different. They may, 
for instance, lack articles as 
evidenced by some of the examples 
mentioned above. The adjectives of 
the nominal category have a special 
marker (-t) in Swedish, cf English 
sun in coastal areas: sunny in coastal 
areas (Swedish: Sol i kustomrddet: 
Soligt i kustomrddet. 
The telegraphic meteorological 
phrases lack finite verbs, but there 
is often a parallel full sentence with 
a future verb will be (available in 
the full sentence module). 
l.a. Sunny in Wales 
1.b. The weather will be sunny in... 
2.a. Sun in the morning 
2.b. There will be sun in... 
3.a. High 20, Low 15 
3.b. The temperature will be 
between 15 and 20 
4.a. Visibility moderate 
4.b. The visibility will be moderate 
4.a. Probably rain 
4.b. It will probably rain

The fol lowing is the basic rule 
showing how Engl ish  weather 
utterances (ewutt) can be generated 
as phrases (ewph) or full sentences 
(ewsent). 
ewutt(T,F,S,\[\]) :- ewph(T,F,S,\[\]). 
ewutt(T,F,S,\[\]) :- ewsent(T,F,S,\[\]). 
The basic rule for phrases is: 
ewph(A,\[event(N),t ime(fut) ,advl(A),  
advl(B),co(C)\]) --> 
eadv(A),enom(N), 
eadv(B),eco(C). 
This rule generates e.g. In the 
morning mild; Rain in the evening; 
In Scotland gale in the afternoon; 
Rain and snow, i.e. nominal phrases 
with adverbial determiners before 
and/or after a nominal which can 
then be an adjective or a noun, 
single or coordinated. As can be 
seen the rules render a list 
representat ion called funct iona l  
event representation, where the 
event is the first term, then actors, 
t ime and adverbials.  There is 
normal ly  no more than two 
adverbial phrases before or after 
the nominal. The last term co(C)  
takes care of cases of coordinated 
phrases or sentences. The first slot 
is used to indicate which constituent 
is in focus (first), information which 
is useful in the text generation 
process. 
The further division of the 
superord inate  category nomina l  
(enom)  is i l lustrated by the 
following rules for English: 
enom(M) --> enp(Agr,M). 
enom(M) --> cap(M). 
enp(Agr,n om(H,Adj,Attr)) --> 
eap(Adj),en(Agr,H),epattr(Agr,Attr).  
Note that noun phrases have to 
carry agreement information (Agr) 
into the post attributive expression 
(epatt r )  as it might be a relative 
clause where tile inflection of the 
verb depends on the features of the 
head of tile np, as in: light winds 
which turn west/ light wind which 
lurns west. 
The following is one of the DCG 
rules generating and analyzing full 
sentences : 
ewsent(N,I event(V),actor(N), 
t ime(T),advl(A 1), 
co(C)\]) --> enp(Agr,N), 
evi(Agr,m(V,T)), 
eadv(A 1 ),esco(C). 
It can for instance generate the 
sentence: A low pressure area 
approaches Scandinavia. Another  
pattern is used in order to generate 
sentences uch as The low pressure 
area will bring rain in Sweden, etc. 
There are about a dozen different 
syntactic structures to be found in 
the forecasts. 
The lexicon has the same 
format as Swetra. The first slot 
contains the form of the item (one 
or several words), the second the 
meaning written in "machinese", the

third slot the grammatical category 
and further slots may be used for 
various features and classif ications. 
The following are some examples. 
slex(\[in\],m(in\],prep . . . . . . . . . . . . .  loc). 
s lex( l "Skandinavien"\ ] ,m(scandinavia,  
prop),n . . . . . . . . . . . . .  loc). 
s lex(\ [p~t,eftermiddagen\] ,m(in_the_af  
ternoon), adv . . . . . . . . . . .  time,dur). 
The lexicon includes a great number 
of mult i -word- i tems of the kind 
i l lustrated by pd eftermiddagen. 
These fixed phrases are particulary 
common in special domains such as 
forecasts.  
The words ,  concepts  and 
objects of forecasts 
Consider the fol lowing text, with 
severa l  a l te rnat ive  second 
sentences.  
A gale is moving towards 
Scandinavia. 
This sentence may be rendered in 
the following way in order to reveal 
the concepts and objects involved, 
some of which can also be referred 
to. The potential referential objects 
are numbered (within parentheses). 
Something (01), which is an instance 
of the concept 'gale' (02) and is 
of the concept 'towards' (08) and 
is denoted by the English word 
towards (09). The goal (010) of the 
movement has the proper name 
Scandinavia (011) in English. 
The fol lowing are some possible 
successive sentences where the 
objects referred to are marked as 
O1,O2 etc. 
It (01) moves fast (1) 
It (04) happens fast (2) 
It (01) is better called a cyclone. (3) 
It (02) translates as "storm" in 
Swedish (4) 
It (09) is better spelled toward (5) 
It (010) includes Sweden (6) 
We take a reference to prove that 
the object is a possible discourse 
object (discourse referent to use 
Karttunen's term, 1976). We may 
cons ider  d i scourse  ob jec ts  as 
individual temporary mental objects 
created pr imari ly for the sake of 
communicat ion .  They can be 
denoted by a word and are 
classified as instances of prototypes 
(concepts), when they are denoted 
by generic words. The classification 
is done according to a set of 
permanent  prototypes  (concepts) .  
What the speaker does is typical ly 
to c reate  temporary  d i scourse  
denoted by the English word ga le  objects, define them as instances of 
(03) does something (04) which is certain types (unless proper names 
an instance of the concept of 'move' can be used, hopefully known to the 
(05) and is denoted by the English l istener) and say something about 
word move (06). The movement has them. 
a direction (07) which is an instance

The first object created in our 
sample text is (O1) and it is said to 
be an instance of the type denoted 
by 'gale' in English. It is said to do 
something which is an instance of 
'movement ' ,  etc. The second 
sentence may refer to different 
objects introduced in the first 
sentence, even to objects denoted by 
verbs or sentences (It moves fast). 
If we are to elaborate this 
sentence we would say T h e 
movement (of the gale towards 
Scandinavia) happens fast, but one 
may also use a hyperonym as in The 
event happens fast and possibly The 
accident happens (or develops) fast. 
We may say that the same object is 
being referred to in the sentence: It 
is a disaster, but in this case one 
may assume the existence of a type 
of object which has been called 
" inc lus ive referent"  by Bonny 
Webber .  
Note the distinction between a 
temporary object created in order to 
think or say something and a 
permanent object such as 'gale'. 
Even a concept can be referred to, 
as i l lust rated by the second 
successive alternative (It translates 
as "storm" in Swedish), where it 
must refer to the object 02, which is 
a concept, not the object 01. 
We may also note that a word 
used may be referred to, as 
il lustrated by It should better be 
spelled "forward", where it certainly 
refers to the word fo rwards .  If it 
were to refer to the concept one 
would not use the word spel led but 
rather denoted. 
This survey is intended to 
clarify that it is generally necessary 
to keep track of the following types 
of objects and representations: 
1) Meteorological objects 
These include both objects proper, 
such as low pressure areas and 
other air masses, and episodes 
(states, events,  and processes) 
describing phenomena such as rain, 
change of temperature, as well as 
locations and time intervals. 
2) Discourse objects 
Discourse objects can be described 
by meteorological objects, but they 
also have linguistic expressions. Not 
all meteorological objects whose 
existence is implied by a forecast 
describe discourse objects. 
3) Grammatical representations 
Grammatical  representat ions refer 
to expressions signifying discourse 
objects 
The main levels of representation i
Weathra are: 
Level of meteorological objects 
air mass: gale doing:move speed: 
fast direction: Scandinavia 
Level of discourse objects 
Ol :ga le  O2:move O3:Scandinav ia  
O4:(=O1) O5:move O6:fast

Level of functional event-repr.

t ime(pres) ,  
adv l ( toward,Scandinav ia) \ ] ,  
\ [event(move) ,actor(ga le) , t ime(pres) ,  
advl( fast) \ ]  
Text level: A gale is moving towards 
Scandinavia. It moves fast. 
The permanent  concepts  which 
constitute frames with information 
is only background objects alluded 
to by the words (cf Nirenburg & 
Defrise, 1991). The concept (frame) 
gale thus includes the information 
that a 'gale' has speed and that this 
speed is between 20 and 30 meters 
per second, a direction (which all 
speeds have),  often leads to 
accidents at sea and along the 
coasts, etc. To an English-speaking 
person the concept is known to be 
denoted by the word ga le ,  to a 
Swede by s torm,  but that is not 
essential information in the concept 
'gale',  The concept 'move' is to 
inc lude the in format ion that 
movement impl ies being at one 
place first and another later, a 
certain speed and direction. To those 
who are familiar with it the concept 
'Scand inav ia '  inc ludes  the 
information that this is a place and 
an area, which covers Norway,  
Sweden, Denmark etc. Scandinavia is 
a proper name and not a generic 
noun and something cannot be said 
to be an instance of the concept 
'Scandinavia'. Concepts are stored as 
frames using the tool FLEX which is 
available with LPA MacProlog. 
Understanding and generating 
weather forecasts 
The program allows a (telegraphic 
or full) sentence to be parsed by the 
grammar and lexicon applying some 
impl icat ional  morphological  proce- 
dures. This analysis renders a kind 
of funct ional  representat ion  as 
shown above. This representation is 
parsed by mapp ing  procedures  
which look for depictable objects 
and places. Words such as sun ,  
sunny, result in a sun in the proper 
place in a map, rain results in the 
proper  symbol ,  wester ly  winds 
results in an arrow with the proper 
direction. Note that several words 
may result in the same symbol on 
the map. Sunny, sun and fair  will all 
be represented by the icon "sun". 
The functional representat ion 
is also scanned by the concept 
f inder which looks for concepts 
about which it has information. Thus 
the frame 'gale' is used as the 
prototype of the instance O1 and 
'move' is used as the prototype of 
02. The meteorological finder looks 
for data for its general frames. 
The system can be used for 
generation by placing a certain icon 
on the map and ca l l ing  for 
generation. This wil l  result in a 
sentence such as telegraphic: Sunny 
AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 nOra" 1992 7 5 4 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
in Southern Sweden, Sun in 
Southern Sweden, Fair in Southern 
Sweden,  or descriptive It will be 
sunny.., There will be sun .... The 
weather will be fair... 
The generation process may be 
set to generate telegraphic or full 
utterances, single or coordinated 
utterances, texts where the area is 
kept in focus, e.g. Wales will get sun 
and light winds or coordinations 
with different areas such as Wales  
will get sun, but Cornwall will get 
rain. The procedures may also 
generate texts where the focus is on 
the weather type as illustrated by 
There will be snow in Scotland and 
in the Midlands or There will be 
snow in Scotland, but rain in Wales. 
Trans la t ion  
The generation triggered by placing 
a meteorological icon on the map 
can be rendered in English or 
Swedish. Parsed and analyzed 
Swedish forecasts can be translated 
into English using the functional 
event representat ion.  The 
functional representations of English 
and Swedish are very similar and 
the few differences are handled by 
transfer rules.
