Abstract 
We describe sister machine translation prototypes, Ntran, an 
English to Japanese system developed at UMIST, and Aidtrans, 
Japanese to English, at Sheffield, both designed for use by an 
English monolingual. Aidtraus uses extensive and sophisticated 
collocational analysis radically to reduce the need for 
conventional post-editing. Ntran offers interactive query at three 
stages: on-line dictionary update, syntactic disambiguation, and 
Japanese lexical selection. The second of these is described and 
illustrated in particular detail, and the underlying philosophy of 
monolingual interaction discussed. 
1. Background 
Under the Alvey Directorate's research programme 
in natural language processing, an English-Japanese machine 
translation project was carried out at the Centre for 
Computational Linguistics, University of Manchester Institute 
of Science and Technology and the Centre for Japanese 
Studies, University of Sheffield. The project ran from October 
1984 to December 1987, and was also funded by International 
Computers Limited (ICL). The UMIST group, led by Peter 
Whitelock, have developed an English-to-Japanese prototype 
(Ntran), while Jiri Jelinek's group at Sheffield have been 
working from Japanese into English (Aidtrans). 
The two prototypes, although very different in 
some aspects of their linguistic and computational pproaches, 
share an important and distinctive design philosophy. Both are 
interactive, and, unlike present commercially available machine 
(aided) translation systems, both are designed for end use by a 
monolingual speaker of English. This paper will discuss the 
means by which each system achieves this, and the issues 
involved in tailoring a system for use by a target language or 
source language speaker. 
2. Aidtrans: the Sheffield Japanese-to-English system 
The Aidtrans Japanese-to-English prototype 
(implemented in C, and running on a Sharp Unix-based 
microcomputer) is an implementation of a comprehensive, 
highly detailed and sophisticated algorithmic grammar of 
Japanese developed by Dr. Jiri Jelinek as a teaching tool for 
rapid intensive instruction in technical Japanese (Jelinek 1978). 
The core of this grammar is its Integrated Dictionary System 
(IDS). The philosophy of IDS is to incorporate as much as 
possible of the grammar and the analysis heuristics in the 
dictionary. This is done in an explici.tly language-specific, and, 
as applied to translation, language-parr specific form, allowing 
great accuracy and precision (at some inevitable cost in 
adaptability). The dictionary of the finished prototype contains 
entries for some 6,000 words. 
While committed to the maximum use of lexieal 
resources, Aidtrans also sees translation as a relation over 
whole texts rather than individual words or even sentences. The 
purpose of each act of translation is to retain the global sense, 
rather than the concatenation of word-meanings, of a text its it 
760 
is reformulated in a different language. To achieve this, it is 
clearly not enough to produce one acceptable translation for 
each separate sentence of a text and adjoin them. Just as a 
syntactic parser will produce alternative analyses of an 
ambiguous sentence from which the one intended must be 
selected, so Aidtrans produces alternative translations of each 
part of the input text, from which the translation most 
appropriate to the context must be selected. 
Such selection from among possible translation 
equivalents i familiar from human translation or post-editing. 
Here, however, much of the selection, or rejection, is cmTied 
out by the system itself. A text-type-specific linear predictive 
model is the basis for determining priorities or preferences 
among the possibilities. Patterns can be recognized at the 
general level of syntactic onfiguration and at the more specific 
level of individual exical items and collocations; at present he 
system recognizes well over 200 different types of 
juxtapositional linkage. In other words, the selectional function 
in Aidtrans is driven by a generalization of valency, augmented 
with priority weightings for the possible valency values. 
3. Ntran: the UMIST English-tu-Japanese system 
Ntran - its design inspired by Rod Johnson, and 
developed and first implemented largely by Peter Whitelock - is 
less target-specific than Aidtrans. The prototype is implemented 
in Prolog for the sake of rapid and perspicuous development; 
versions now exist in Cprolog, New Improved (Edinburgh) 
Prolog, and Quintus. During the course of development, 
versions have been run on a DEC MicroVax II, an ICL PERQ, 
and most recently a Sun 3/50 workstation. 
Through a system of nested menus, Ntran functions 
on three levels: as a system development system, a grammar 
development system, and a translation system proper. Each 
level offers specific facilities for the writing, testing and 
debugging of appropriate areas of program code. (For details, 
see Whitelock et al1986). 
Although both prototypes give the maximum 
weight and information content o the lexicon, another point of 
difference between them is that Ntran is committed to the 
principle of translation as linguistics (cf. Johnson 1987), and 
designed and implemented as an explicit embodiment of 
contemporary lexicalist linguistic theory. The English analysis 
grammar is based on Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, ed. 
1982) and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al
1985), the Japanese generation grammar on Categorial 
Grammar (Steedman 1985, Whitelock 1987). 
In analysis, words are first looked up in an English 
morpho-syntactic dictionary which specifies grarmnatical 
category and morphologically determined features uch as tense 
and number. The entries in this, as in all dictionaries, are 
compacted by "feature co-occurrence r strictions" which factor 
out any feature-values which are predictable on the basis of 
others. These derive largely from the fcrs of Generalized Phrase 
Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al1985). In English, for 
example, any lexical item which has tense must be finite and a 
verb. In a lexical entry assigning any value to "tense", the 
specification of finiteness and verb-hood would be redundant, 
and can be supplied by a generalized rule of the form 
ft.~t(te, lse=_,\[thl=linite, stemtyp--verb\]). 
Shktilarly, a~ any verb has no noun features, but sets (possibly 
emp!~) of Inepositional complements and adjuncts, and as any 
'4ng form i~ a progressive finite verb, we have rules 
tct (ca t=verb,\[nounfeat.s=\[\],peomp=setC),adj unct=setC)\] ). 
fer(nffonn-~ing,\[stemtyp=verb,aspect=progress,inf=no\]). 
Osiilg thi,~ l~mited information, the parser builds all possible 
"functional structures" (the "f-structures" of LFG), which .serve 
at an hlterawAiate representation abstracting away ficom surface 
constituent structm~, a particularly valuable level when 
~ta~liating between a configarational language such as English 
aid a non--configurational one such as Japanese. 
~ second stage of lookup in the English "subeat" 
dictionmy, which holds possible subeategorization patterns, 
elinilnates spurious f-slxuctures, and provides a semantic 
irtterpretatioo ("s-structure") for those which remain. (Cf Wood 
ut al 1.987.) S-structure forms the basis for transfer, driven by 
bilingual dictionaries, the only component to hold contrastive 
infol-mation. The resulting Japanese s-structure is the basis for 
generation of a Japanese f-structure, using syntactic information 
held in the bilingual and Japanese dictionaries in the form of 
the eomple? categories and combination rules of a unification 
catcgorild grammar (see Whitelock 1988 for details). Surface 
ordering of the Japanese output is finally carried out by linear 
precedence rules. "lTae role and form of user interaction will be 
discussed below. 
4. Techniques for interactive translation 
As mentioned earlier, both Aidtrans and Ntran are 
designed for an English monolingual end-user. This approach - 
reflected in the joint project's Alvey title, "Read and write 
Japanese without knowing it" - distinguishes them from 
cun'ently commercially available machine (aided) translation 
systems~ and has led to a nmnber of distinctive design 
decisions. 
4ol Aidtcans 
lu the case of Aidtrans, the intention was, while 
leaving the lhml selection of the exact translation to the end- 
user, to prod,ace output of greater accuracy and coherence than 
is generally Jbund in current post-editing systems. The strategy 
of multiple l;eneration produces a set of complete alternative 
translations, 3uther than one which nmst be amended piecemeal 
by a posteditur, while the text-type-based predictive model and 
preference-weighted linkages cut down greatly on the range 
actually offeled to the end-user, and group those which survive 
into semantically and stylistically coherent wholes. Thus, while 
a conventional posteditor needs access to the source text to 
cheek the accuracy of raw output and as a guide to its revision, 
hexv~ enough information is available in the output to form the 
basis of the end-user's final selection. 
4.2 Ntran 
The facilities for, or demands on, the end-user of 
Ntran me somewhat more complex: both the complexity of the 
task and the inner ariienlation of the system are greater, giving 
both the ne~d and the opportunity for a variety of interactions 
(~1' Jotmson & Whitelock 1987). 'lb ensure to an English 
mor, olinl~al technical writer file output of accurate and 
acceptable ~vpanese, the conventionalstrategy would be pre- 
editing, passing to the mactgut~ only text in a restricted sub- 
lalguag~ known to be with~ its translation capacity. Our 
system ca)uk~ perhaps be said to offer interactive pre-editing 
hatedeavCd with translation, rather than interactive translation 
paotscr, as ~o contcastive or bilingual information is presented 
to the end user hi the interaction. The restricted input sub- 
language, however, is simply grammatical English, which if 
a~nbig~ons must be disambiguated. This should be seen not as 
a constraint c~n a technical writer but as a desideratum. 
The Ntran prototyl~ is designed to offer three 
torms of interactive query: onYlfiae dictionary creation, syntactic 
disambiguadon of English input, and Japanese lexieal selection 
in transfer. 
4.2.1 Dictionary update 
When a word is found in an input text for which 
no dietionaly entry yet exists, the user is offered the option of 
creating an entry for it immediately. This is done using a tree- 
structured question procedure, eliciting the category of the 
English word and its values for the features associated with that 
category, such as mass/count and animacy for nouns, valency 
and aspectual type for verbs, gradability for adjectives, and so 
on. The on-line dictionary building routine, although it 
incorporates a reasonable range of information about an English 
word, does not ask for Japanese translation equivalents. Instead, 
entries created in this way are held in a separate dictionary file, 
where they are aceessible to the analysis component, but also 
set aside for later completion by a bilingual inguist. 
Until this is done the English word is at present 
simply passed into the Japanese output in its original form, 
marked off by a special delimiting character. We intend to 
implement in a fnrther developed version of the system a 
facility for passing through such words in katakana 
transcription. Given a reasonable core dictionary, most new 
words will be specialized technical terms, for which this will in 
fact be the correct rendering. 
4.2.2 Syntactic disambiguation 
Syntactic ambiguities in the English input are also 
referred to the user for dismnbiguation. The parser fnrst builds a 
surface syntactic dependency structure, or functional structure, 
which is then mapped to a deep or semantic structure, and a 
record kept of the mappings ('obj', for example, is mapped to 
'argO'). During this mapping stage, a record is also kept, for 
each well-formed s-structure produced, of the set of mappings 
entailed by the subeategofization requirements of the lexical 
items involved. Each mapping records the derived semantic 
relation which is assigned between a constituent and its parent. 
Examples of "maptrace" are given with the examples below. 
The disanlbiguation module then computes a set of 
differences among all the recorded mapping sets and builds a 
set of all those relations which are true for only a subset of the 
parses. These are then presented to the user, after conversion of 
some of the internal semantic relation names to external names 
which are intended to be more immediately understandable. 
The generator for the user-form representation f mappings is: 
deseribeas(map(X,Y,Z),\[X,' is ' C,' of ',Z\]) :- 
logtocase(Y,C),!. 
logtocase(argO,objec0. 
logtocase(argl,agen0. 
logtocase(ben,beneficiary). 
logtocase(loc,location). 
logtocase(rep,representation). 
logtocase(instr,instmment). 
logtocase(adj unet,modifier). 
logtocase(X,X). 
It should be noted that this mechanism suceesfully represents 
both purely structural ambiguities uch as prepositional phrase 
attachment, and also subeategorization ambiguities, as in "write 
on the deck of the ship", where "deck" could be either the 
location or object of "write". 
The alternatives are presented as a set of statements 
distinctively characterizing thepossible semantic interpretations, 
as can be seen in the examples below. The user responds with 
the number of  any statement which is true, or 'T' followed by 
the number of any statement which is false. 
761 
Because of a technical implementation detail 
cons'tituents are at present referred to only by their heads: thus, 
in this example set of queries, "and is object of active" means 
"(workstations and terminals) is object of active". Obviously 
this aspect of the presentation could be improved in a more 
fully developed system. One could also present he alternatives 
in quite different ways, by paraphrases of alternative readings, 
for example, or dependency trees or some other graphical 
interface, generated by the same underlying mechanism. 
4.2.3 Japanese lexical selection 
Finally, ambiguities, or alternatives, may arise in 
the selection of a Japanese translation equivalent for an English 
wo,d or expression. Interactive systems standardly offer such 
alternatives directly to the user, who must have some 
competence in the target language to be able to make rite 
choice. Ntran's Japanese dictionary entdes include English 
glosses, and the user will be offered these to chose between, 
rather than the Japanese head-words. This facility is not yet 
fully implemented. 
5. The system as translator and the monolingual ,~.sex ~ 
Clearly, ensuring reliable ti'anslafion tbr ~ 
monolingual user in either direction requires a system dt:sig~l 
carefully tuned to the task. In the ease of "import ranslation", 
translating into the user's language, the information content of 
the output text must be sufficiently rich that, in cases of 
uncertainty, reference to the source text (the traditional recourse 
of the post-editor) is adequately replaced by reference to the set 
of coherent possibilities offered in that output. This is exactly 
the strategy implemented in Aidtrans. 
In the case of "export ranslation", when the user is 
a speaker of the source language, the system can ,'equest 
additional information at a number of stages in the translation 
chain, to supplement the information inherent in the staface 
form of the input text, if that proves insufficient for syntactic 
analysis, serrmntie interpxetafion, and/or target language lexical 
selection. (Although the obvious, and ultimate, source of such 
supplememtary information is the human end-user, we envisage 
the long-teml possibility of referring queries first to intelligent, 
world-knowledge-based modules within the system, leaving the 
human user as a progressively less often needed safety net) 
Ntran's modularity of design isolates the stages of the process 
clearly from each other, while our commitment o the 
implementation of linguistic theory offers formats for the 
presentation of choices by the system and the input or' 
iuformation by the user which are transparent toboth.
