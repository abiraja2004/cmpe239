Abstract
We report a high-performance Chinese NER
system that incorporates Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs) and first-order logic for the fourth
SIGHAN Chinese language processing bake-
off (SIGHAN-6). Using current state-of-the-
art CRFs along with a set of well-engineered
features for Chinese NER as the base model,
we consider distinct linguistic characteristics in
Chinese named entities by introducing various
types of domain knowledge into Markov Logic
Networks (MLNs), an effective combination of
first-order logic and probabilistic graphical mod-
els for validation and error correction of enti-
ties. Our submitted results achieved consistently
high performance, including the first place on the
CityU open track and fourth place on the MSRA
open track respectively, which show both the at-
tractiveness and effectiveness of our proposed
model.
1 Introduction
We participated in the Chinese named entity recognition
(NER) task for the fourth SIGHAN Chinese language
processing bakeoff (SIGHAN-6). We submitted results
for the open track of the NER task. Our official re-
sults achieved consistently high performance, including
the first place on the CityU open track and fourth place on
the MSRA open track. This paper presents an overview
of our system due to space limit. A more detailed de-
scription of our model is presented in (Yu et al, 2008).
Our Chinese NER system combines the strength of two
graphical discriminative models, Conditional Random

Fields (CRFs) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs).
First, we employ CRFs, a discriminatively trained undi-
rected graphical model which has been shown to be an
effective approach to segmenting and labeling sequence
data, as our base system. Second, we model the linguis-
tic and structural information in Chinese named entity
composition. We exploit a variety of domain knowledge
which can capture essential characteristics of Chinese
named entities into Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), a
powerful combination of first-order logic and probability,
to (1) validate and correct errors made in the base sys-
tem and (2) find and extract new entity candidates. These
domain knowledge is easy to obtain and can be well and
concisely formulated in first-order logic and incorporated
into MLNs.
2 Conditional Random Fields as Base
Model
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001)
are undirected graphical models trained to maximize the
conditional probability of the desired outputs given the
corresponding inputs. CRFs have been shown to perform
well on Chinese NER shared task on SIGHAN-4 (Zhou et
al. (2006), Chen et al (2006a), Chen et al (2006b)). We
employ CRFs as the base model in our framework. In this
base model, we design features similar to the state-of-the-
art CRF models for Chinese NER. We use character fea-
tures, word segmentation features, part-of-speech (POS)
features, and dictionary features, as described below.
Character features: These features are the current char-
acter, 2 characters preceding the current character and 2
following the current character. We extend the window
size to 7 but find that it slightly hurts. The reason is that
CRFs can deal with non-independent features. A larger
window size may introduce noisy and irrelevant features.
Word segmentation and POS features: We train our
own model for conducting Chinese word segmentation
and POS tagging. We employ a unified framework to
integrate cascaded Chinese word segmentation and POS
tagging tasks by joint decoding that guards against vi-

olations of those hard-constraints imposed by segmenta-
tion task based on dual-layer CRFs introduced by Shi and
Wang (2007).
We separately train the Chinese word segmentation
and POS tagging CRF models using 8-month and 2-
month PKU 2000 corpus, respectively. The original PKU
2000 corpus contains more than 100 different POS tags.
To reduce the training time for POS tagging experiment,
we merge some similar tags and obtain only 42 tags fi-
nally. For example, {ia, ib, id, in, iv}?i. We use
the same features as described in (Shi and Wang, 2007),
except that we do not use the HowNet features for word
segmentation. Instead, we use max-matching segmenta-
tion features based on a word dictionary. This dictionary
contains 445456 words which are extracted from People?s
Daily corpus (January-June, 1998), CityU, MSRA, and
PKU word segmentation training corpora in SIGHAN-6.
For decoding, we first perform individual decoding for
each task. We then set 10-best segmentation and POS
tagging results for reranking and joint decoding in order
to find the most probable joint decodings for both tasks.
Dictionary features: We obtain a named entity dictio-
nary extracted from People?s Daily 1998 corpus and PKU
2000 corpus, which contains 68305 PERs, 28408 LOCs
and 55596 ORGs. We use the max-matching algorithm
to search whether a string exists in this dictionary.
In summary, we list the features used for our CRF base
model in Table 1. Besides the unigram feature template,
CRFs also allow bigram feature template. With this tem-
plate, a combination of the current output token and pre-
vious output token (bigram) is automatically generated.
We use CRF++ toolkit (version 0.48) (Kudo, 2005) in
our experiments. We find that setting the cut-off threshold
f for the features not only decreases the training time, but
improves the NER performance. CRFs can use the fea-
tures that occurs no less than f times in the given training
data. We set f = 5 in our system.
We extend the BIO representation for the chunk tag
which was employed in the CoNLL-2002 and CoNLL-
2003 evaluations. We use the BIOES representation in
which each character is tagged as either the beginning of
a named entity (B tag), a character inside a named en-
tity (I tag), the last character in an entity (E tag), single-
character entities (S tag), or a character outside a named
entity (O tag). We find that BIOES representation is
more informative and yields better results than BIO rep-
resentation.
3 Markov Logic Networks as Error
Correction Model
Even though the CRF model is able to accommodate a
large number of well-engineered features which can be
easily obtained across languages, some NEs, especially
Table 1: Feature template for CRF model.
Character features (1.1) Cn, n ? [?2, 2]
(1.2) CnCn+1, n ? [?2, 1]
Word features (1.3) Wn, n ? [?3, 3]
(1.4) WnWn+1, n ? [?3, 2]
POS features (1.5) Pn, n ? [?3, 3]
(1.6) PnPn+1, n ? [?3, 2]
Dictionary features (1.7) Dn, n ? [?2, 2]
(1.8) DnDn+1, n ? [?2, 1]
(1.9) D?1D+1
LOCs and ORGs are difficult to identify due to the lack
of linguistic or structural characteristics.
We incorporate domain knowledge that can be well
formulated into first-order logic to extract entity candi-
dates from CRF results. Then, the Markov Logic Net-
works (MLNs), an undirected graphical model for statis-
tical relational learning, is used to validate and correct
the errors made in the base model.
MLNs conduct relational learning by incorporating
first-order logic into probabilistic graphical models under
a single coherent framework (Richardson and Domingos,
2006). Traditional first-order logic is a set of hard con-
straints in which a world violates even one formula has
zero probability. The advantage of MLNs is to soften
these constraints so that when the fewer formulae a world
violates, the more probable it is. MLNs have been applied
to tackle the problems of gene interaction discovery from
biomedical texts and citation entity resolution from cita-
tion texts with state-of-the-art performance (Riedel and
Klein (2005), Singla and Domingos (2006)).
We use the Alchemy system (Beta version) (Kok et al,
2005) in our experiment, which is a software package
providing a series of algorithms for statistical relational
learning and probabilistic logic inference, based on the
Markov logic representation.
3.1 Domain Knowledge
We extract 165 location salient words and 843 organiza-
tion salient words from Wikipedia and the LDC Chinese-
English bi-directional NE lists compiled from Xinhua
News database. We also make a punctuation list which
contains 18 items and some stopwords which Chinese
NEs cannot contain. We extract new NE candidates from
the CRF results according to the following consideration:
? If a chunk (a series of continuous characters) occurs in the
training data as a PER or a LOC or an ORG, then this
chunk should be a PER or a LOC or an ORG in the testing
data. In general, a unique string is defined as a PER, it
cannot be a LOC somewhere else.
? If a tagged entity ends with a location salient word, it is a
LOC. If a tagged entity ends with an organization salient
word, it is an ORG.

? If a tagged entity is close to a subsequent location salient
word, probably they should be combined together as a
LOC. The closer they are, the more likely that they should
be combined.
? If a series of consecutive tagged entities are close to a sub-
sequent organization salient word, they should probably
be combined together as an ORG because an ORG may
contain multiple PERs, LOCs and ORGs.
? Similarly, if there exists a series of consecutive tagged en-
tities and the last one is tagged as an ORG, it is likely that
all of them should be combined as an ORG.
? Entity length restriction: all kinds of tagged entities can-
not exceed 25 Chinese characters.
? Stopword restriction: intuitively, all tagged entities cannot
comprise any stopword.
? Punctuation restriction: in general, all tagged entities can-
not span any punctuation.
? Since all NEs are proper nouns, the tagged entities should
end with noun words.
? For a chunk with low conditional probabilities, all the
above assumptions are adopted.
3.2 First-Order Logic Construction
All the above domain knowledge can also be formulated
as first-order logic to construct the structure of MLNs.
First-order formulae are recursively constructed from
atomic formulae using logical connectives and quanti-
fiers. Atomic formulae are constructed using constants,
variables, functions, and predicates.
For example, we use the predicate organization(
candidate) to specify whether a candidate is an ORG.
If ??I?/China Government? is mis-tagged as a
LOC by the CRF model, but it contains the organization
salient word ??/Government?. The corresponding
formula endwith(r, p)?orgsalientword(p)
?organization(r) means if a tagged entity r ends
with an organization salient word p, then it is extracted as
a new ORG entity. Typically only a small number (e.g.,
10-20) of formulae are needed. We declare 14 predi-
cates and 15 first-order formulae according to the domain
knowledge mentioned in Section 3.1.
3.3 Training and Inference for Named Entity
Correction
Each extracted new NE candidate is represented by one
or more strings appearing as arguments of ground atoms
in the database. The goal of NE prediction is to deter-
mine whether the candidates are entities and the types of
entities (query predicates), given the evidence predicates
and other relations that can be deterministically derived
from the database.
We extract all the NEs from the official training cor-
pora, and then convert them to the first-order logic repre-
sentation according to the domain knowledge. The MLN
training database that consists of predicates, constants,
and ground atoms was built automatically. We also ex-
tract new entity candidates from CRF results and con-
struct MLN testing database in the same way.
During MLN learning, each formula is converted to
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and a weight is learned
for each of its clauses. These weights reflect how often
the clauses are actually observed in the training data. In-
ference is performed by grounding the minimal subset
of the network required for answering the query pred-
icates. Conducting maximum a posteriori (MAP) in-
ference which finds the most likely values of a set of
variables given the values of observed variables can be
performed via approximate solution using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Gibbs sampling can
be adopted by sampling each non-evidence variable in
turn given its Markov blanket, and counting the fraction
of samples that each variable is in each state.
4 Experiment Details
4.1 Data and Preprocessing
The training corpora provided by the SIGHAN bakeoff
organizers were in the CoNLL two column format, with
one Chinese character per line and hand-annotated named
entity chunks in the second column. The CityU corpus
was traditional Chinese. We converted this corpus to sim-
plified Chinese and we used UTF-8 encoding in all the
experiments so that all the resources (e.g., word dictio-
nary and named entity dictionary) are compatible in our

Table 2 shows the statistics of NER training and testing
corpora and Table 3 shows the OOV (Out of Vocabulary)
rate of NER testing corpora 1. The number of NEs in
CityU corpus is almost twice as many as that in MSRA
corpus. The OOV rate in CityU corpus is much higher
than in MSRA corpus for PERs, LOCs and ORGs. These
numbers indicate that NER on CityU corpus is much
more difficult to handle.
4.2 Model Development
We performed holdout methodology to develop our
model. We randomly selected 5000 sentences fromCityU
training corpus for development testing and the rest for
training. We did the same thing for MSRA training cor-
pus.
To avoid overfitting for CRF model, we penalized
the log-likelihood by the commonly used zero-mean
Gaussian prior over the parameters. Also, the MLNs
were trained using a Gaussian prior with zero mean and
unit variance on each weight to penalize the pseudo-
likelihood, and with the weights initialized at the mode
of the prior (zero).
We found an optimal value for the parameter c 2 for
CRFs. Using held-out data, we tested all c values, c ?
[0.2, 2.2], with an incremental step of 0.4. Finally, we set
c = 1.8 for CityU corpus and c = 1.0 for MSRA corpus.
5 Official Results
Table 4 presents the results obtained on the official CityU
and MSRA test sets. Our results are consistently good:
we obtained the first place on the CityU open track (90.33
overall F-measure) and fourth place on the MSRA open
track (92.88 overall F-measure) respectively. The lower

nizer due to the tagging inconsistency of this corpus.
2This parameter trades the balance between overfitting and
underfitting. With larger c value, CRF tends to overfit to the give
training corpus. The results will significantly be influenced by
this parameter
F-measure obtained on CityU corpus can be attributed to
the higher OOV rate of this corpus.
6 Conclusion
We have described a Chinese NER system incorporating
probabilistic graphical models and first-order logic which
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the open track of
SIGHAN-6. We exploited domain knowledge which can
capture the essential features of Chinese NER and can
be concisely formulated in MLNs, allowing the training
and inference algorithms to be directly applied to them.
Our proposed framework can also be extendable to NER
for other languages, due to the simplicity of the domain
knowledge we could access.
