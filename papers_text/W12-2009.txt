Abstract 
Paraphrasing is an important aspect of language 
competence; however, EFL learners have long 
had difficulty paraphrasing in their writing 
owing to their limited language proficiency. 
Therefore, automatic paraphrase suggestion 
systems can be useful for writers. In this paper, 
we present PREFER1, a paraphrase reference 
tool for helping language learners improve their 
writing skills. In this paper, we attempt to 
transform the paraphrase generation problem 
into a graphical problem in which the phrases 
are treated as nodes and translation similarities 
as edges. We adopt the PageRank algorithm to 
rank and filter the paraphrases generated by the 
pivot-based paraphrase generation method. We 
manually evaluate the performance of our 
method and assess the effectiveness of 
PREFER in language learning. The results 
show that our method successfully preserves 
both the semantic meaning and syntactic 
structure of the query phrase. Moreover, the 
students? writing performance improve most 
with the assistance of PREFER.  
1. Introduction 
Paraphrasing, or restating information using 
different words, is an essential part of productive 
language competence (Fuchs, 1980; Mel??uk, 1992; 
Martinot, 2003). However, EFL learners have 
difficulty paraphrasing in their writing partly

because of their insufficient lexical knowledge 
(Abasi et al 2006; Chandrasoma et al 2004). If 
they are provided with direct and substantial 
support while writing, they may be able to express 
their thoughts more fluently. Unfortunately, few 
paraphrase reference tools have been developed to 
provide instant assistance to learners in their 
writing process. In the light of the pressing need 
for paraphrase reference tools, we develop 
PREFER, a paraphrasing assistant system to help 
EFL learners vary their expression during writing.  
Over the past decade, paraphrasing techniques 
have played an important role in many areas of 
Natural Language Processing, such as machine 
translation, and question answering. However, very 
few studies have been conducted concerning the 
application of automatic paraphrase generation 
techniques in language learning and teaching.  
In this paper, we treat the paraphrase generation 
problem as a graph-related problem. We adopt the 
PageRank algorithm (Page et al, 1999) to generate 
paraphrases based on the assumption that a page 
with more incoming links is likely to receive a 
higher rank. Meanwhile, a page which is linked by 
a higher ranked page should transitively be ranked 
higher. We take advantage of transitivity of 
relevance to rank and filter the paraphrases 
generated by the pivot-based method (i.e., phrase 
are treated as paraphrases if they share the same 
translations) of Bannard and Callison-Burch 
(2005).  
The advantage of the pivot approach is that the 
generated paraphrases are exactly semantically 
equivalent to the query phrase. However, its 
80
  
quality of the paraphrases highly correlates with 
that of the techniques of bilingual alignment. To 
overcome such limitation, we use the PageRank 
algorithm to refine the generated paraphrases. In 
other words, we leverage the PageRank algorithm 
to find more relevant paraphrases that preserve 
both meaning and grammaticality for language 
learners. The results of a manual evaluation and a 
system assessment show that our approach and 
system perform well. 
2. Related Work 
A number of studies have investigated EFL leaners? 
paraphrase competence. For example, Campbell 
(1987) reveals that language proficiency 
significantly affects paraphrasing competence. 
McInnis (2009) reports that paraphrasing task is 
more difficult for L2 students than that for L1 
students. According to Milicevic (2011), L2 
learners propose less valid paraphrases than native 
speakers. These findings indicate that EFL students 
have problems in paraphrasing. In view of this, we 
develop PREFER, a paraphrase reference tool, for 
helping English learners with their writing. 
Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has 
been an area of active research and the related 
work has been thoroughly surveyed in 
Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well 
as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). In the rest of this 
section, we focus on reviewing the methods related 
to our work.  
One prominent approach to paraphrase 
generation is based on bilingual parallel corpora. 
For example, Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) 
propose the pivot approach to generate phrasal 
paraphrases from an English-German parallel 
corpus. With the advantage of its parallel and 
bilingual natures of such a corpus, the output 
paraphrases do preserve semantic similarity. 
Callison-Burch (2008) further places syntactic 
constraints on generated paraphrases to improve 
the quality of the paraphrases. In this paper, we 
generate paraphrases adopting the pivot-based 
method proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch 
(2005) in the first round. Then we use a 
graph-based approach to further ensure paraphrase 
candidates preserve both meaning and 
grammaticality. 
In a study more closely related to our work, 
Kok and Brockett (2010) take a graphical view of 
the pivot-based approach. They propose the Hitting 
Time Paraphrase algorithm (HTP) to measure 
similarities between phrases. The smaller the 
number of steps a random walker goes from one 
node to the other, the more likely these two nodes 
are paraphrases. The main difference between their 
work and ours lies in the definition of the graph. 
While they treat multilingual phrases as nodes, we 
treat only English phrases as nodes. Besides, we 
define the edges between nodes as semantic 
relation instead of bilingual alignment. 
In contrast to the previous work, we present a 
graph-based method for refining the paraphrases 
generated by the pivoting approach. Our goal is to 
consolidate the relation between paraphrases to 
provide learners with more and better paraphrases 
which are helpful in expanding their lexical 
knowledge. 
3. Graph-Based Paraphrase Generation 
In this section, we describe how we use the 
PageRank algorithm to rank and filter the 
paraphrases generated by the pivot-based method. 
3.1 Graph Construction 
We first exploit the pivot-based method proposed 
by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) to populate 
our graph G using of candidate paraphrases 
cP={             } from a bilingual parallel 
corpus B for a query phrase q. Each phrase in cP is 
also represented as a node in G. Note that the 
query phrase q is excluded from cP.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  A simple graph G. Note that the cp1 and 
   
  
 will be linked iff    
  
 is the paraphrase of q 
and is also the paraphrase of      
 
q 
cP 
        
 
   
    
      
81
  
Graph G only contains the paraphrases cpi 
whose probabilities are higher than a certain 
threshold ?2  as nodes. In addition, each cpi is 
linked to the query phrase q with edge e which is 
weighted by the probability  (   | ). Furthermore, 
we establish the edges among the phrases in cP. 
An example graph is shown in Figure 1. By 
repeating the previous steps, for each phrase cp1, 
cp2,... in cP, we find their corresponding 
paraphrases,         
 
  
        and 
         
 
  
       ?., and discard the 
paraphrases that are not in cP. Once the phrases are 
linked with their paraphrases, the graph G is 
created.  
In this paper, we also place a constraint that a 
paraphrase of a phrase q must neither be a 
substring nor a superstring of q. These strings are 
usually aligned with the same foreign language 
phrase while they are not paraphrases at all. For 
example, ?play an important? and ?play an 
important role in? are excluded for ?play an 
important role?. This has the effect of reducing 
some of the noise generated by the pivot-based 
method.   
3.2 Graph-Based Paraphrase Generation 
We then refine the generated paraphrases adopting 
the PageRank algorithm proposed by Page et al 
(1999). Consider a graph consisting of a set of 
webpages on the Web V and a set of hyperlinks E. 
The PageRank algorithm assigns a value PR to 
each webpage as their importance measurement. 
The PR value of a certain page u is defined 
iteratively as the following equation: 
  ( )   ?
  ( )
 ( )
                   ( )
    
 
where Bu is a set of pages linked to u and L(.) 
denotes the number of outbound links from a page 
v.  
Intuitively, by using formula (1) iteratively, we 
are able to calculate the PR values for all nodes 
and thus extract relatively important paraphrases. 
However, the original PageRank algorithm does 
not take the weight of each edge into consideration. 
That is, the PageRank algorithm treats all links 
equally when distributing rank scores. Treating all 
links equally in paraphrase generation task might 
                                                 
2 We set ? to be 0.01. 
lose some linguistic properties. For this, we 
consider the importance of edges of the nodes and 
weight the edges based on the paraphrase 
probability in the pivot-based approach using 
 (      )  ? ( |  ) ( |  )
 
      ( )  
Formula (2) represents the probability that the 
phrase u is the paraphrase of the phrase v. f refers 
to shared translations of v and u. Then for each 
iteration of the PageRank calculation, we reassign 
the PR value for all u in V to be PR?(u) as:  
   ( )   ?
 (   )  ( )
 ( )
           ( )
    
 
Instead of treating all edges equally, formula (3) 
integrates the weights of inbound link and 
outbound link edges (see Section 4 for the 
performance differences with and without 
weighting edges). 
4. Results 
In this section, we first present our experimental 
setting. Then evaluation results are reported. 
4.1 Experimental Setting 
In this paper, word alignments were produced by 
Giza++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) over a set of 
Danish-English section (containing 1,236,427 
sentences) of the Europarl corpus, version 2 
(Koehn, 2002).  
We compared our graph-based approach with a 
strong baseline, the pivot-based method with 
syntactic constraint (SBP) (Callison-Burch, 2008) 
utilizing the same Danish-English corpus. We also 
investigate the contribution of adding the edge 
weights to the PageRank algorithm by building 
two models, PR representing the method of the 
PageRank algorithm without weights and PRw 
representing the method of the weighted PageRank 
algorithm, for comparison.   
To assess the performance of our method, we 
conducted a manual evaluation. We asked an 
experienced English lecturer to randomly select 
100 most commonly used and meaningful phrases 
from 30 research articles in the discipline of 
Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL). A 
total of 88 unique phrases were used as our test set 
for evaluation excluding 12 phrases not existing in 
the Europarl corpus. For each phrase, we extracted 
82
  
the corresponding candidate paraphrases and chose 
top 5 for evaluation. Two raters, provided with a 
simplified scoring standard used by Callison-Burch 
(2008), manually evaluate the accuracy of the top 
ranked paraphrases of each phrase by score 0, 1 
and 2. It is worth noting that the raters were asked 
to score each paraphrase candidate by considering 
its appropriateness in various contexts. In this 
evaluation, we strictly deemed a paraphrase to be 
correct if and only if both raters scored 2.  The 
inter-annotator agreement was 0.63.   
The coverage was measured by the number of 
correct answers within top 5 candidates. The 
precision was measured by the number of correct 
answers within the returned answers. 
On the other hand, to assess the effectiveness of 
PREFER in language learning, we carried out an 
experiment with 55 Chinese-speaking EFL college 
freshmen, who had at least six years of formal 
instruction from junior to senior high schools and 
were estimated to be at the intermediate level 
regarding their overall English competence. The 
students were randomly divided into three groups. 
They were asked to paraphrase seven short 
paragraphs in the pre-test with no system support, 
and then paraphrase another seven short 
paragraphs in the post-test using three different 
tools: PREFER (P), LONGMAN Dictionary of 
Contemporary English Online (L), and 
Thesaurus.com (T). A total of 22 default phrases 
(http://140.114.75.22/share/examples.htm) were 
embedded in the paragraphs in the pre- and 
post-tests, targeted at comparing the quality and 
quantity of students? paraphrasing performance. 
Students were not restricted to paraphrase these 
embedded phrases. Instead, they were encouraged 
to replace any possible phrases or even restructure 
sentences. We had two experienced native-speaker 
TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) 
lecturers to score the students? paraphrasing 
performance. 
4.2 Experimental Results 
4.2.1 Manual Evaluation 
As shown in Table 1, PRw achieved both good 
precision and coverage. Moreover, PR and PRw 
performed better than SBP in both coverage and 
precision. Also, the result that the performance of 
PRw is better than that of PR implies that PRw is 
able to generate more semantically and 
syntactically correct paraphrases. However, the 
precision of 0.19 indicates that there is still room to 
improve the paraphrase generation model.  
 
 
 
  PR PRw SBP 
Coverage 0.17 0.18 0.07 
Precision 0.17 0.19 0.10 
Table 1: The measurement of paraphrases. 
 
Additionally, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is 
also reported. Here, MRR is defined as a measure 
of how much effort needed to locate the first 
appropriate paraphrase for the given phrase in the 
ranked list of paraphrases. The MRR score of PRw 
(0.53) outperformed PR (0.51) and SBP (0.47). It 
demonstrated that the PRw model facilitates the 
high ranking of good paraphrases (i.e., paraphrases 
with meaning and grammaticality preserved would 
be ranked high).  
4.2.2. Evaluation on Language Learning  
The second evaluation is to assess the effectiveness 
of PREFER applied to CALL. We used a 
comparison method to measure the extent to which 
EFL learners achieved good performance in 
paraphrasing.  
 
Table 2. Comparison of paraphrasing performance 
among students using three different reference tools.  
 
As seen in the first row of Table 2, the students? 
writing performance improved most with the 
assistance of PREFER (i.e., group P), compared 
with group L and group T. We further analyzed 
and compared the number of the rephrased phrases 
and the correct paraphrases, and the rate of 
    P L T 
improvement of paraphrasing 
task 
38.2% -31.6% -6.2% 
all 
paraphrasable 
phrases 
rephrased 38.4% -23.2% 9.5% 
correct 53.3% -17.5% 4.6% 
correctness rate  7.9% 4.9% -3.1% 
22 default 
phrases 
rephrased 68% -16% 28% 
correct 100% -5% 31% 
correctness rate 13.6% 7.9% 1.5% 
83
  
correctness students achieved using different 
reference tools among our testing paraphrase 
candidates (see the middle and bottom panels of 
Table 2). Obviously, the students consulting 
PREFER achieved substantial paraphrasing 
improvement in all three aspects of both all and 
default phrases. But the other two groups seemed 
unable to manage well the paraphrasing task with 
traditional way of phrase information. This limited 
information seems insufficient to enable students 
to familiarize themselves with proper usages of 
phrases which might lead to improper 
paraphrasing. 
In short, PREFER outperformed the other two 
reference tools in assisting EFL learners in their 
paraphrasing task. 
5. Conclusion and Future Work   
In this paper, we treat the paraphrase generation 
problem as a graphical problem. We utilize the 
PageRank algorithm to rank and filter the 
paraphrases generated using the pivot-based 
method. The results show that our method 
significantly produces better paraphrases in both 
precision and coverage compared with the 
syntactically-constrained pivot method of 
Callison-Burch (2008). Additionally, PREFER 
does benefit learners? writing performance. 
 In order to conduct a more comprehensive 
evaluation, we plan to adapt the in-context 
evaluation metric introduced by Callison-Burch et. 
al (2008). A larger test set would be generated 
manually to evaluate the performance of our 
paraphrase system. In addition, we will implement 
various kinds of baseline systems such as Kok and 
Brockett (2010) and Chan et al (2011) to provide a 
more competitive comparison. 
Many avenues exist for future research and 
improvement. For example, we would like to 
extend paraphrasing consecutive n-gram phrases to 
inconsecutive ones such as ones with incomplete 
transitive verbs (e.g., ?provide someone with 
something?). Besides, we are interested in 
weighting edges using syntactic and semantic 
relation in our graph-based method to further 
improve the quality of generated paraphrases.
