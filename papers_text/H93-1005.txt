ABSTRACT 
The HCRC Map Task corpus has been collected 
and transcribed in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and 
recently published on CD-ROM. This effort was 
made possible by funding from the British 
Economic and Social Research Council. 
The corpus is composed of 128 two-person conver- 
sations in both high-quality digital audio and 
orthographic transcriptions, amounting to 18 
hours and 150,000 words respectively. 
The experimental design is quite detailed and 
complex, allowing a number of different phone- 
mic, syntactico-semantic and pragmatic con- 
trasts to be explored in a controlled way. 
The corpus is a uniquely valuable resource for 
speech recognition research in particular, as we 
move from developing systems intended for con- 
trolled use by familiar users to systems intended 
for less constrained circumstances and naive or 
occasional users. Examples supporting this 
claim are given, including preliminary evi- 
dence of the phonetic consequences of second 
mention and the impact of different styles of ref- 
erent negotiation on communicative efficacy. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The HCRC Map Task corpus has been col- 
lected and transcr ibed in Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, and recently published on CD- 
ROM (HCRC 1993). This effort was made 
possible by funding from the Brit ish 
Economic and Social Research Council. 
The group which designed and collected the 
corpus covers a wide range of interests and 
the corpus reflects this, providing a resource 
for studies of natural  dialogue from many 
different perspectives. 
In this paper we will give a brief summary of 
the experimental design, and then concen- 
trate on those aspects of the corpus which 
make it a uniquely valuable resource for 
speech recognition research in particular, as 
we move from developing systems intended 
25 
for controlled use by familiar users to sys- 
tems intended for less constrained circum- 
stances and naive or occasional users. Some 
prel iminary results of work on the phonetic 
consequences of second mention and on the 
impact of different styles of referent negotia- 
tion on communicative fficacy will also be 
presented. 
2. CORPUS DESIGN AND 
CHARACTERISTICS 
2.1. The Task 
The conversations were elicited by an exer- 
cise in task-oriented cooperative problem 
solving. The two participants at facing one 
another in a small recording studio, sepa- 
rated by a table on which sat back-to-back 
reading stands. On each stand was a 
schematic map, each visible only to one par- 
ticipant. Each map consisted of an outline 
and roughly a dozen labelled features (e.g. 
"white cottage", "Green Bay", "oak forest"). 
Most features are common to the two maps, 
but not all, and the participants were in- 
formed of this. One map had a route drawn 
in, the other did not. The task was for the 
participant without the route to draw one on 
the basis of discussion with the participant 
with the route. 
2.2. Experimental  Design 
Using an elaboration of a design developed 
over a number of years (see e.g. Brown, 
Anderson et al 1983), we recorded 128 two- 
person conversations (each talker in four 
conversations), employing 64 talkers (32 
male, 32 female), almost all born and raised 
in the Glasgow area, speaking with an edu- 
cated West of Scotland accent. High quality 
recordings were made using Shure SM10A 
close-talking microphones, one talker per 
channel on stereo DAT (Sony DTC1000ES). 
The experimental design is quite detailed and 
complex, allowing a number of different 
phonemic, syntactico-semantic and prag- 
matic contrasts to be explored in a controlled 
way. In particular, maps and feature names 
were designed to allow for controlled explo- 
ration of phonological reductions of various 
kinds in a number of different referential 
contexts, and to provide a range of different 
stimuli  to referent negotiation, based on 
matches and mis-matches between the two 
maps. 
Among the independent variables in the de- 
sign were: 
? Eye-contact---in half  the conversa- 
tions, the participants could see 
one another's faces, in half, they 
could not. 
Famil iar ity-- in half  the conversa- 
tions, the talkers were acquain- 
tances, in half, strangers. 
Task role--Each ta lker  partici- 
pated in four conversations, two 
as Instruction Giver (the one with 
the route) and two as Instruction 
Follower (the one trying to draw it) 
For a complete description of the experimen- 
tal design, see Anderson, Bader et al (1991). 
2.3. Corpus Ch~racterlstics 
Subjects accommodated asily to the task and 
experimental setting, and produced evidently 
unselfconscious and f luent speech. The 
syntax is largely clausal rather than senten- 
tial; showing good turn-taking, with rela- 
tively little overlap/interruption. The total 
corpus runs about 18 hours of speech, yield- 
ing 150,000 word tokens drawn from 2,000 
word form types. Word lists containing all 
the feature names were also elicited from all 
speakers, along with a number of 'accent di- 
agnosis' utterances. 
The acoustic quality of the recordings is good 
but not outstanding-- in  particular, stereo 
separation is not perfect, in that it is often 
possible to detect he voice of one talker very 
faintly on the other talker's channel. A very 
modest amount of rumble and other non- 
specific background noise is occasionally de- 
tectable. 
3. THE TRANSCRIPTIONS 
The transcriptions are at the orthographic 
level, quito detailed, including filled pauses, 
false starts and repetitions, broken words, 
26 
etc. Considerable care has been taken to en- 
sure consistency of notation, which is thor- 
oughly documented. Although the full com- 
plexity of overlapped regions has not been re- 
flected in the transcriptions, such regions 
are  clearly set off from the rest of the tran- 
scripts. Transcripts are connected to the 
acoustic snmpled data by sample numbers 
marked every few turns. 
Text Encoding Init iative-compliant SGML 
markup is used, both within transcripts to 
indicate turn boundaries and for other meta- 
textual purposes, and also in separate corpus 
header and transcript header files, but this 
was done in a manner designed to make ac- 
cessing the transcripts as plain text very 
easy. 
We also used a very light-weight non-TEI 
markup for textual annotations, to mark 
such things as abandoned words, letter 
names, filled pauses and editorial uncertain- 
ties. 
A brief extract from a transcript is given be- 
low as Figure 1, i l lustrating various aspects 
of the transcription, including the tags u for 
utterance, s fo for speech file offset, bo for 
begin overlap and eo for end overlap, as well 
as the le  microtag for a letter name.

4. THE CD-ROMS 
The published version of the corpus occupies 
8 CD-ROMs, and contains: 
? a complete set of transcripts; 
? 20KHz sampled versions of both 
channels of the associated speech 
for all the conversations; 
? for each talker sampled audio for 
an accent diagnostic passage and 
a scripted reading of a list of all 
the feature names from the map; 
? images of the maps employed; 
? documentation; 
? UN IX  TM too ls  for l inking the spo- 
ken and written mater ial  and 
other manipulations of the corpus 
materials. 
Preparation of the corpus for publication was 
a much larger task than we had expected, 
and is described in some detail in (Thompson 
& Bader, 1993). 
5. IMPLICATIONS FOR SPEECH 
RECOGNITION 
5.1. High-q-~llty un~cripted dialogue 
Recorded collections of natural conversation 
are not newmnot only do many l inguists 
have a drawer full of tapes of dinner table or 
staff room talk, but also more systematic and 
extensive collection efforts have been carried 
out on several occasions as part of major ref- 
erence corpora building projects. But with no 
exceptions we are aware of, all such material 
is of highly varying acoustic quality, and is 
rarely if ever suitable for extensive computa- 
tional processing. 
On the other hand, to date the large develop- 
ment corpora collected and used to such good 
effect by the speech recognition community, 
although of a very high standard acousti- 
cally, have been exclusively monologue, and 
until very recently exclusively scripted. 
Thus the Map Task corpus occupies a hith- 
erto vacant position in corpus design space 
it is natural, unscripted ialogue recorded to 
a standard suitable for digital processing. 
We hope the widespread availability of such a 
resource will help to stimulate a change in 
the way phonology, morphology, syntax and 
semantics are pursued parallel to the change 
which has already occurred in phonetics, 
that is, a change from theory development 
27 
dependent on small amounts of data, often 
constructed by the theorist, to theory develop- 
ment dependent  on, indeed immersed 
with in,  a large amount  of natura l ly  
occurring data. 
Note that this methodological change is, or at 
least ought to be, independent of meta-theo- 
retical disposition, and in part icular the 
above remarks are not meant to imply a bias 
in favour of stochastic or self-organising the- 
oretical frameworks. 
5.2. Syntax 
There is modest controversy brewing about 
the relation between spoken and written lan- 
guage, particularly in a highly literate lan- 
guage/culture context such as obtains for 
English. It has been argued (see e.g. Miller 
1993) that the grammar of spoken English is 
qualitatively different from that of written 
English, and demands eparate treatment. 
In so far as the progress of speech recogni- 
tion from relatively constrained interaction 
situations and relatively constrained lan- 
guage will depend on grammars  and/or 
models of natural  English conversation, the 
resource provided by the Map Task has an 
obvious rule to play. 
5.3. Prosody 
It has long been assumed that there is a 
mutual ly  informing relat ionship between 
prosody and discourse structure. The simple

goal-oriented nature of the Map Task conver- 
sations, and the ease with which quite local, 
short-term goals can be identified in terms of 
the part of the route in question at any given 
time, means that the corpus provides an ex- 
cellent base at attempting to explicate this 
relationship in some detail. Work has begun 
on relating the inventories of intonation on 
the one hand and moves within conversa- 
tional gRmes on the other, with initially en- 
couraging resul ts  (Kowtko, I sard  and 
Doherty 1992). 
As in the case of syntax, we would hope that 
widespread provision of the corpus will en- 
able comparative xploration of the numer- 
ous theories of discourse structure, prosody 
and their relations now being suggested. 
5.4. Fast speech rules 
The names associated with the landmarks 
drawn on the maps were designed inter alia 
to provide opportunities for various forms of 
phonological modification, in part icular t- 
delet ion ("vast  meadow"),  d-delet ion 
("reclaimed fields"), glottal isat ion ("white 
mountain") and nasal assimi lat ion ("crane 
bay"). Furthermore, on each map one such 
name would be paired with another, s imilar 
name, with the intention of assessing the 
impact of the (putative) necessity of con- 
trastive stress ("crane bay" vs. "green bay"). 
The availability in the corpus of citation form 
pronunciations be each speaker will provide 
a very useful baseline for studies in this area.

5.5. The role of eye contact 
Not surprisingly, there are obvious gross ef- 
fects on the conversations of the difference be- 
tween the eye-contact and no-eye-contact 
conditions. The no-eye-contact conversations 
contained 22% more turns on average, but 
only 18% more words, i.e. more turns, but 
each fewer words per turn. This is presum- 
ably because of the increased need for fre- 
quent back-channel confirmations in the no- 
eye-contact ondition. 
The overall statistics for word tokens and 
turns are as given in Table 1. The im- 
plications of the language differences in- 
duced by the presence or absence of eye-con- 
tact are clearly significant for a range of dif- 
ferent potential speech technology applica- 
tions. See (Boyle, Anderson & Newlands, in 
press) for more details. 
6. PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
6.1. Second Mention 
The duration and/or (excerpted) intelligi- 
bility of different tokens of a word uttered by 
the same speaker have been shown to depend 
on the availability of information outwith 
the word's acoustic shape which might help 
listeners to recognize it. In  the context of ex- 
tended discourse, this means word tokens 
are less intelligible when they refer to Given 
entities. 
On the face of it, the tendency to produce de- 
graded tokens where they are redundant 
seems wonderful ly cooperative, in the 
Gricean sense of the term: when there is 
previous relevant material, intelligibility is 
reduced. The less intelligible repeated to- 
kens are in fact helpful to listeners, for they 
make better prompts to earlier discourse 
material, either because they signal listen- 
ers to associate the word's meaning with 
some entity already established in a dis- 
course model (Fowler and Housum, 1987) 
or because such stored information must be 
called into play for successful on-line word 
recognition (Bard et al, 1991). 
The difficulty is that degraded tokens are 
not restricted to contexts in which the lis- 
tener can recover the conditioning infor- 
marion. Using the Map Task corpus, we 
have begun to investigate how far speakers' 
adjustment of intelligibility is egocentrically 
rather than cooperatively based, that is, how 
far the speaker's own relevant knowledge 
provides his/her model for what the lis- 
tener knows. 
We have found the expected loss of intelligi- 
bility for excerpted second mentions as 
against both first mentions and citation 
forms. Interestingly, we found that the co- 
referential repetition effect found for mono- 
logue holds in dialogue: it doesn't matter who 
utters the word first. When it comes to the 
second mention of an entity either speaker 
may reduce intelligibility. This suggests that 
dialogue participants maintain a common 
record of textually evoked given entities. 
It would also appear that once an entity is 
textually evoked there is no further effect of 
visual information. That is, it doesn't matter 
whether the listener or speaker can see the 
object hey're referring to. 
Also relevant is a significant intelligibility 
loss we found in mentions which are only 
'second' for the speaker, because the relevant 
feature was first mentioned not in the cur- 
rent conversation, but in a previous 
conversation with a different listener. 
Thus on the basis of our investigations todate 
it would appear, somewhat surprisingly, that 
speakers reduce articulatory effort on a 
purely egocentric basis, without regard to lis- 
teners' ability to share the contextual condi- 
tioning this implies. 
Emea~ of New Item Introduction 
The Map Task corpus presents an excellent 
opportunity for examining how speakers in- 
troduce new i tems into a discourse. 
Moreover, because we can measure to overall 
communicative effectiveness of a conversa- 
tion by reference to the accuracy of the result- 
ing map, we can go further and attempt to 
assess the value of particular item introduc- 
tion strategies. 
Definite versus indefinite article is almost 
certainly too simplistic a starting point for 
investigating this issue. This is born out by a 
tabulation of new item introduction over half 
29 
the corpus, as shown in Table 2. 
introductions are those in which the speaker "Right

Overall definites and indefinites appeared 
with equal frequency. 
If we look at listener's responses to the intro- 
duction of items they don't have on their 
map, we see a significant correlation of in- 
formative responses ("I haven't got an extinct 
volcano") with question introductions, but not 
with indefinite article usage as such. Also, 
using the accuracy of the route drawn as a 
measure  of communicat ive fficacy, we 
found a significant correlation between use of 
question introductions by the IG and route 
accuracy. There is an independent correla- 
tion between informative IF responses and 
accuracy. See (Anderson & Boyle, in press) 
for more details. 
7. CONCLUSION 
The HCRC Map Task corpus has been de- 
signed to allow investigation of a range of is- 
sues relevant o both psychological models of 
human language production and compre- 
hension and to speech technology, especially 
as the focus on effort switches to more natu- 
ral, unconstrained speech. Prel iminary re- 
sults of studies in several areas provide en- 
couraging evidence that the corpus will in- 
deed yield valuable insights.
