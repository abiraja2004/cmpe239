Abstract
This work presents a simplified approach to
bilingual topic modeling for language model
adaptation by combining text in the source
and target language into very short documents
and performing Probabilistic Latent Semantic
Analysis (PLSA) during model training. Dur-
ing inference, documents containing only the
source language can be used to infer a full
topic-word distribution on all words in the tar-
get language?s vocabulary, from which we per-
form Minimum Discrimination Information
(MDI) adaptation on a background language
model (LM). We apply our approach on the
English-French IWSLT 2010 TED Talk exer-
cise, and report a 15% reduction in perplexity
and relative BLEU and NIST improvements
of 3% and 2.4%, respectively over a baseline
only using a 5-gram background LM over the
entire translation task. Our topic modeling ap-
proach is simpler to construct than its counter-
parts.
1 Introduction
Adaptation is usually applied to reduce the per-
formance drop of Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) systems when translating documents that de-
viate from training and tuning conditions. In this
paper, we focus primarily on language model (LM)
adaptation. In SMT, LMs are used to promote fluent
translations. As probabilistic models of sequences
of words, language models guide the selection and
ordering of phrases in translation. With respect to
?This work was carried out during an internship period at
Fondazione Bruno Kessler.
LM training, LM adaptation for SMT tries to im-
prove an existing LM by using smaller amounts of
texts. When adaptation data represents the trans-
lation task domain one generally refers to domain
adaptation, while when they just represent the con-
tent of the single document to be translated one typ-
ically refers to topic adaptation.
We propose a cross-language topic adaptation
method, enabling the adaptation of a LM based on
the topic distribution of the source document dur-
ing translation. We train a latent semantic topic
model on a collection of bilingual documents, in
which each document contains both the source and
target language. During inference, a latent topic dis-
tribution of words across both the source and tar-
get languages is inferred from a source document
to be translated. After inference, we remove all
source language words from the topic-word distribu-
tions and construct a unigram language model which
is used to adapt our background LM via Minimum
Discrimination Information (MDI) estimation (Fed-
erico, 1999, 2002; Kneser et al, 1997).
We organize the paper as follows: In Section 2,
we discuss relevant previous work. In Section 3, we
review topic modeling. In Section 4, we review MDI
adaptation. In Section 5, we describe our new bilin-
gual topic modeling based adaptation technique. In
Section 6, we report adaptation experiments, fol-
lowed by conclusions and future work in Section 7.
2 Previous work
Zhao et al (2004) construct a baseline SMT system
using a large background language model and use it
to retrieve relevant documents from large monolin-
294
gual corpora and subsequently interpolate the result-
ing small domain-specific language model with the
background language model. In Sethy et al (2006),
domain-specific language models are obtained by
including only the sentences that are similar to the
ones in the target domain via a relative entropy based
criterion.
Researchers such as Foster and Kuhn (2007) and
Koehn and Schroeder (2007) have investigated mix-
ture model approaches to adaptation. Foster and
Kuhn (2007) use a mixture model approach that in-
volves splitting a training corpus into different com-
ponents, training separate models on each compo-
nent, and applying mixture weights as a function of
the distances of each component to the source text.
Koehn and Schroeder (2007) learn mixture weights
for language models trained with in-domain and out-
of-domain data respectively by minimizing the per-
plexity of a tuning (development) set and interpolat-
ing the models. Although the application of mixture
models yields significant results, the number of mix-
ture weights to learn grows linearly with the number
of independent language models applied.
Most works focus on monolingual language
model adaptation in the context of automatic speech
recognition. Federico (2002) combines Probabilis-
tic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann,
1999) for topic modeling with the minimum dis-
crimination information (MDI) estimation criterion
for speech recognition and notes an improvement
in terms of perplexity and word error rate (WER).
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) techniques have
been proposed as an alternative to PLSA to construct
purely generative models. LDA techniques include
variational Bayes (Blei et al, 2003) and HMM-LDA
(Hsu and Glass, 2006).
Recently, bilingual approaches to topic model-
ing have also been proposed. A Hidden Markov
Bilingual Topic AdMixture (HM-BiTAM) model is
proposed by Zhao and Xing (2008), which con-
structs a generative model in which words from a
target language are sampled from a mixture of topics
drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Foreign words
are sampled via alignment links from a first-order
Markov process and a topic specific translation lexi-
con. While HM-BiTAM has been used for bilingual
topic extraction and topic-specific lexicon mapping
in the context of SMT, Zhao and Xing (2008) note
that HM-BiTAM can generate unigram language
models for both the source and target language and
thus can be used for language model adaptation
through MDI in a similar manner as outlined in Fed-
erico (2002). Another bilingual LSA approach is
proposed by Tam et al (2007), which consists of
two hierarchical LDA models, constructed from par-
allel document corpora. A one-to-one correspon-
dence between LDA models is enforced by learn-
ing the hyperparameters of the variational Dirichlet
posteriors in one LDA model and bootstrapping the
second model by fixing the hyperparameters. The
technique is based on the assumption that the topic
distributions of the source and target documents are
identical. It is shown by Tam et al (2007) that the
bilingual LSA framework is also capable of adapt-
ing the translation model. Their work is extended
in Tam and Schultz (2009) by constructing paral-
lel document clusters formed by monolingual doc-
uments using M parallel seed documents.
Additionally, Gong et al (2010) propose transla-
tion model adaptation via a monolingual LDA train-
ing. A monolingual LDA model is trained from ei-
ther the source or target side of the training corpus
and each phrase pair is assigned a phrase-topic dis-
tribution based on:
M? ji =
wjk ?M
j
i
?m
k=1w
j
k
, (1)
where M j is the topic distribution of document j
and wk is the number of occurrences of phrase pair
Xk in document j.
Mimno et al (2009) extend the original con-
cept of LDA to support polylingual topic models
(PLTM), both on parallel (such as EuroParl) and
partly comparable documents (such as Wikipedia ar-
ticles). Documents are grouped into tuples w =
(w1, ...,wL) for each language l = 1, ..., L. Each
document wl in tuple w is assumed to have the
same topic distribution, drawn from an asymmetric
Dirichlet prior. Tuple-specific topic distributions are
learned using LDA with distinct topic-word concen-
tration parameters ?l. Mimno et al (2009) show that
PLTM sufficiently aligns topics in parallel corpora.

3 Topic Modeling
3.1 PLSA
The original idea of LSA is to map documents to
a latent semantic space, which reduces the dimen-
sionality by means of singular value decomposition
(Deerwester et al, 1990). A word-document matrix
A is decomposed by the formulaA = U?V t, where
U and V are orthogonal matrices with unit-length
columns and ? is a diagonal matrix containing the
singular values of A. LSA approximates ? by cast-
ing all but the largest k singular values in ? to zero.
PLSA is a statistical model based on the likeli-
hood principle that incorporates mixing proportions
of latent class variables (or topics) for each obser-
vation. In the context of topic modeling, the latent
class variables z ? Z = {z1, ..., zk} correspond to
topics, from which we can derive probabilistic distri-
butions of words w ?W = {w1, ..., wm} in a docu-
ment d ? D = {d1, ..., dn} with k << n. Thus, the
goal is to learn P (z | d) and P (w|z) by maximizing
the log-likelihood function:
L(W,D) =
?
d?D
?
w?W
n(w, d) logP (w | d), (2)
where n(w, d) is the term frequency of w in d.
Using Bayes? formula, the conditional probability
P (w | d) is defined as:
P (w | d) =
?
z?Z
P (w | z)P (z | d). (3)
Using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algo-
rithm (Dempster et al, 1977), we estimate the pa-
rameters P (z|d) and P (w|z) via an iterative pro-
cess that alternates two steps: (i) an expectation
step (E) in which posterior probabilities are com-
puted for each latent topic z; and (ii) a maximiza-
tion (M) step, in which the parameters are updated
for the posterior probabilities computed in the previ-
ous E-step. Details of how to efficiently implement
the re-estimation formulas can be found in Federico
(2002).
Iterating the E- and M-steps will lead to a con-
vergence that approximates the maximum likelihood
equation in (2).
A document-topic distribution ?? can be inferred
on a new document d? by maximizing the following
equation:
?? = arg max
?
?
w
n(w, d?) log
?
z
P (w | z)?z,d? ,
(4)
where ?z,d? = P (z | d?). (4) can be maximized by
performing Expectation Maximization on document
d? by keeping fixed the word-topic distributions al-
ready estimated on the training data. Consequently,
a word-document distribution can be inferred by ap-
plying the mixture model (3) (see Federico, 2002 for
details).
4 MDI Adaptation
An n-gram language model approximates the prob-
ability of a sequence of words in a text W T1 =
w1, ..., wT drawn from a vocabulary V by the fol-
lowing equation:
P (W T1 ) =
T?
i=1
P (wi|hi), (5)
where hi = wi?n+1, ..., wi?1 is the history of n ?
1 words preceding wi. Given a training corpus B,
we can compute the probability of a n-gram from a
smoothed model via interpolation as:
PB(w|h) = f
?
B(w|h) + ?B(h)PB(w|h
?), (6)
where f?B(w|h) is the discounted frequency of se-
quence hw, h? is the lower order history, where
|h|?1 = |h?|, and ?B(h) is the zero-frequency prob-
ability of h, defined as:
?B(h) = 1.0?
?
w?V
f?B(w|h).
Federico (1999) has shown that MDI Adaptation
is useful to adapt a background language model
with a small adaptation text sample A, by assum-
ing to have only sufficient statistics on unigrams.
Thus, we can reliably estimate P?A(w) constraints
on the marginal distribution of an adapted language
model PA(h,w) which minimizes the Kullback-
Leibler distance from B, i.e.:
PA(?) = arg min
Q(?)
?
hw?V n
Q(h,w) log
Q(h,w)
PB(h,w)
.
(7)
296
The joint distribution in (7) can be computed us-
ing Generalized Iterative Scaling (Darroch and Rat-
cliff, 1972). Under the unigram constraints, the GIS
algorithm reduces to the closed form:
PA(h,w) = PB(h,w)?(w), (8)
where
?(w) =
P?A(w)
PB(w)
. (9)
In order to estimate the conditional distribution of
the adapted LM, we rewrite (8) and simplify the
equation to:
PA(w|h) =
PB(w|h)?(w)
?
w??V PB(w?|h)?(w?)
. (10)
The adaptation model can be improved by
smoothing the scaling factor in (9) by an exponential
term ? (Kneser et al, 1997):
?(w) =
(
P?A(w)
PB(w)
)?
, (11)
where 0 < ? ? 1. Empirically, ? values less than
one decrease the effect of the adaptation ratio to re-
duce the bias.
As outlined in Federico (2002), the adapted lan-
guage model can also be written in an interpolation
form:
f?A(w|h) =
f?B(w|h)?(w)
z(h)
, (12)
?A(h) =
?B(h)z(h?)
z(h)
, (13)
z(h) = (
?
w:NB(h,w)>0
f?B(w|h)?(w)) + ?B(h)z(h
?),
(14)
which permits to efficiently compute the normaliza-
tion term for high order n-grams recursively and by
just summing over observed n-grams. The recursion
ends with the following initial values for the empty
history :
z() =
?
w
PB(w)?(w), (15)
PA(w|) = PB(w)?(w)z()
?1. (16)
MDI adaptation is one of the adaptation methods
provided by the IRSTLM toolkit and was applied as
explained in the following section.
5 Bilingual Latent Semantic Models
Similar to the treatment of documents in HM-
BiTAM (Zhao and Xing, 2008), we combine parallel
texts into a document-pair (E,F) containing n par-
allel sentence pairs (ei, fi), 1 < i ? n, correspond-
ing to the source and target languages, respectively.
Based on the assumption that the topics in a parallel
text share the same semantic meanings across lan-
guages, the topics are sampled from the same topic-
document distribution. We make the additional as-
sumption that stop-words and punctuation, although
having high word frequencies in documents, will
generally have a uniform topic distribution across
documents; therefore, it is not necessary to remove
them prior to model training, as they will not ad-
versely affect the overall topic distribution in each
document. In order to ensure the uniqueness be-
tween word tokens between languages, we annotate
E with special characters. We perform PLSA train-
ing, as described in Section 3.1 and receive word-
topic distributions P (w|z), w ? VE ? VF
Given an untranslated text E?, we split E? into
a sequence of documents D. For each document
di ? D, we infer a full word-document distribu-
tion by learning ?? via (4). Via (3), we can generate
the full word-document distribution P (w | d) for
w ? VF .
We then convert the word-document probabilities
into pseudo-counts via a scaling function:
n(w | d) =
P (w | d)
maxw? P (w? | d)
??, (17)
where ? is a scaling factor to raise the probabil-
ity ratios above 1. Since our goal is to generate a
unigram language model on the target language for
adaptation, we remove the source words generated
in (17) prior to building the language model.
From our newly generated unigram language
model, we perform MDI adaptation on the back-
ground LM to yield an adapted LM for translating
the source document used for the PLSA inference
step.
6 Experiments
Our experiments were done using the TED Talks
collection, used in the IWSLT 2010 evaluation task1.
1http://iwslt2010.fbk.eu/
297
In IWSLT 2010, the challenge was to translate talks
from the TED website2 from English to French. The
talks include a variety of topics, including photog-
raphy and pyschology and thus do not adhere to
a single genre. All talks were given in English
and were manually transcribed and translated into
French. The TED training data consists of 329 par-
allel talk transcripts with approximately 84k sen-
tences. The TED test data consists of transcriptions
created via 1-best ASR outputs from the KIT Quaero
Evaluation System. It consists of 758 sentences and
27,432 and 27,307 English and French words, re-
spectively. The TED talk data is segmented at the
clause level, rather than at the level of sentences.
Our SMT systems are built upon the Moses open-
source SMT toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007)3. The trans-
lation and lexicalized reordering models have been
trained on parallel data. One 5-gram background
LM was constructed from the French side of the
TED training data (740k words), smoothed with the
improved Kneser-Ney technique (Chen and Good-
man, 1999) and computed with the IRSTLM toolkit
(Federico et al, 2008). The weights of the log-linear
interpolation model were optimized via minimum
error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on the TED
development set, using 200 best translations at each
tuning iteration.
This paper investigates the effects of language
model adaptation via bilingual latent semantic mod-
eling on the TED background LM against a baseline
model that uses only the TED LM.
6.1 Bilingual Latent Semantic Model
Using the technique outlined in Section 5, we con-
struct bilingual documents by splitting the parallel
TED training corpus into 41,847 documents of 5
lines each. While each individual TED lecture could
be used as a document, our experimental goal is
to simulate near-time translation of speeches; thus,
we prefer to construct small documents to simulate
topic modeling on a spoken language scenario in
which the length of a talk is not known a priori.
We annotate the English source text for removal af-
ter inference. Figure 1 contains a sample document
constructed for PLSA training. (In fact, we distin-

guish English words from French words by attach-
ing to the former a special suffix.) By using our in-
house implementation, training of the PLSA model
on the bilingual collection converged after 20 EM
iterations.
Using our PLSA model, we run inference on each
of the 476 test documents from the TED lectures,
constructed by splitting the test set into 5-line docu-
ments. Since our goal is to translate and evaluate the
test set, we construct monolingual (English) docu-
ments. Figure 2 provides an example of a document
to be inferred. We collect the bilingual unigram
pseudocounts after 10 iterations of inference and re-
move the English words. The TED lecture data is
transcribed by clauses, rather than full sentences, so
we do not add sentence splitting tags before training
our unigram language models.
As a result of PLSA inference, the probabilities
of target words increase with respect to the back-
ground language model. Table 1 demonstrates this
phenomenon by outlining several of the top ranked
words that have similar semantic meaning to non-
stop words on the source side. In every case, the
probabilityPA(w) increases fairly substantially with
respect to the PB(w). As a result, we expect that the
adapted language model will favor both fluent and
semantically correct translations as the adaptation is
suggesting better lexical choices of words.

Table 1: Sample unigram probabilities of the adaptation
model for document #230, compared to the baseline un-
igram probabilities. The French words selected are se-
mantically related to the English words in the adapted
document. The PLSA adaptation infers higher unigram
probabilities for words with latent topics related to the
source document.
6.2 MDI Adaptation
We perform MDI adaptation with each of the un-
igram language models to update the background
TED language model. We configure the adaptation
rate parameter ? to 0.3, as recommended in Fed-
erico (2002). The baseline LM is replaced with each
adapted LM, corresponding to the document to be
translated. We then calculate the mean perplexity of
the adapted LMs and the baseline, respectively. The
perplexity scores are shown in Table 2. We observe a
15.3% relative improvement in perplexity score over
the baseline.
6.3 Results
We perform MT experiments on the IWSLT 2010
evaluation set to compare the baseline and adapted
LMs. In the evaluation, we notice a 0.85 improve-
ment in BLEU (%), yielding a 3% improvement over
the baseline. The same performance trend in NIST
is observed with a 2.4% relative improvement com-
pared to the unadapted baseline. Our PLSA and
MDI-based adaptation method not only improves
fluency but also improves adequacy: the topic-
based adaptation approach is attempting to suggest
more appropriate words based on increased unigram
probabilities than that of the baseline LM. Table 3
demonstrates a large improvement in unigram se-
lection for the adapted TED model in terms of the
individual contribution to the NIST score, with di-
minishing effects on larger n-grams. The majority
of the overall improvements are on individual word
selection.
Examples of improved fluency and adequacy are
shown in Figure 3. Line 285 shows an example of a
translation that doesn?t provide much of an n-gram
improvement, but demonstrates more fluent output,
due to the deletion of the first comma and the move-
ment of the second comma to the end of the clause.
While ?installation? remains an inadequate noun in
this clause, the adapted model reorders the root
words ?rehab? and ?installation? (in comparison
with the baseline) and improves the grammaticality
of the sentence; however, the number does not match
between the determiner and the noun phrase. Line
597 demonstrates a perfect phrase translation with
respect to the reference translation using semantic
paraphrasing. The baseline phrase ?d?origine? is
transformed and attributed to the noun. Instead of
translating ?original? as a phrase for ?home?, the
adapted model captures the original meaning of the
word in the translation. Line 752 demonstrates an
improvement in adequacy through the replacement
of the word ?quelque? with ?autre.? Additionally,
extra words are removed.
These lexical changes result in the improvement
in translation quality due to topic-based adaptation
via PLSA.

7 Conclusions
An alternative approach to bilingual topic modeling
has been presented that integrates the PLSA frame-
work with MDI adaptation that can effectively adapt
a background language model when given a docu-
ment in the source language. Rather than training
two topic models and enforcing a one-to-one cor-
respondence for translation, we use the assumption
that parallel texts refer to the same topics and have
a very similar topic distribution. Preliminary exper-
iments show a reduction in perplexity and an overall
improvement in BLEU and NIST scores on speech
translation. We also note that, unlike previous works
involving topic modeling, we did not remove stop
words and punctuation, but rather assumed that these
features would have a relatively uniform topic distri-
bution.
One downside to the MDI adaptation approach
is that the computation of the normalization term
z(h) is expensive and potentially prohibitive during
continuous speech translation tasks. Further investi-
gation is needed to determine if there is a suitable
approximation that avoids computing probabilities
across all n-grams.
