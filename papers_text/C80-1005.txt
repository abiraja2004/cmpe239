Abstract 
The paper presents an outline of a system for 
g rammat ica l  tagging of the London-Lund Corpus 
of spoken English consisting of some 450 000 
words. The material, all of which will be 
available on magnetic computer  tape, and part 
of which is now available in both machine-  
readable and printed form, has been transcrib- 
ed orthographically with prosodic mark ing  for 
tone units, nuclei, stresses, pauses, etc (see 
Samples 1 and Z). Whereas  there is now con- 
siderable agreement  on the usefulness of a 
tagged corpus, there is as yet no consensus on 
the best type of tagging, let alne the procedure 
involved. The analysis proposed here is of 
course specifically a imed at tagging spoken 
English, but should be largely applicable also 
to written English. 
The syntactic tagging will initially be based on 
surface properties, since we are interested in 
gaining information that is directly available 
through the signals that hearers use for decod- 
ing a message,  ie their perceptual strategies. 
In this respect, the plan is no innovation. One 
computer  discourse mode l  which is intended 
"to tackle prob lems that a speaker evidently 
tackles" has recently been reported by Davey  
(1978.4). His model, however, is designed to 
produce, not understand. Another and more  
important difference between the SSE system 
and the Davey  mode l  and most  other computer  
discourse models  is that the latter have been 
devised to handle restricted and artificial 
universes of discourse, such as describing 
games  or mov ing  blocks. However,  the work  
of Winograd (197Z), for example, is directly 
relevant to our task, since it deals with wider 
aspects of language and makes  impressive use 
of Halliday's systemic grammar  for producing 
parsing algorithms. 
One of our a ims is to make  the tagging proce- 
dure as automatic as possible. Specifically, 
we would like to see how far it is possible to 
carry out syntactic analysis based on graphic 
words and prosody (provided by the material) 
and word  class tags (provided by a general- 
purpose dictionary). Given that no fully 
automatic system for grammat ica l  tagging 
exists, we propose to imp lement  an interactive, 
semi -manua l  mode of analysis. 
The paper will present word  class tagging of 
types f rom the Longman Dictionary of Con- 
temporary  English, disambiguation of tokens 
and phrase tagging by means  of a set of parsing 
algorithms. The basic unit of analysis will be 
the tone unit. In a previous study of Survey 
material of spoken English, it was found that 
the overall average length of a tone unit was 
5.3 words and that "there was considerable 
correlation between the length of tone units and 
their g rammat ica l  contents" with a "high degree 
of co-extensiveness between tone units and 
grammat ica l  units of group, phrase, and 
clause structure" (Quirk et al1964). 
The search for grammat ica l  phrases will be 
f rom right to left within the tone unit. Since 
this search sequence is definitely unorthodox, 
some explanation may be called for. By  and 
large, English phrase structure typically has 
the head to the right, as in 
Verb phrases: will be DOING 
Noun phrases: the nice little DOG 
Adjective phrases: stunningly BEAUTIFUL  
Assuming  that a good number  of the tone units 
consist of, at least, g rammat ica l  phrases, the 
nucleus will occur within the phrase and, more  
often than not, within the head of the phrase. 
Thus, it is likely that it will be linguistically 
rewarding as well as computationally economi-  
cal to search f rom right to left. It seems that 
a left-to-right search method  also runs into 
difficulties with solving left-recursion struc- 
tures and predicting numerous  alternatives. 
The phrase recognition rules are to be applied 
in the following order: 
(VPH) Verb phrases 
(APH)  Adverb  phrases 
(JPH) Adjective phrases 
(NPH)  Noun phrases  
(PPH) Prepositional phrases 
29-- 
The typical features of this system are: taking 
tone units as the basis of grammat ica l  analysis, 
choosing a general-purpose dictionary for word  
class tagging, mak ing  extensive use of phrase 
structure rules which are applied in a certain 
order and cyclically, and partly adopting an 
interactive mode of analysis.
