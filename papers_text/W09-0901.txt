Abstract
This paper introduces a formal view of
the semantics and pragmatics of corrective
feedback in dialogues between adults and
children. The goal of this research is to
give a formal account of language coor-
dination in dialogue, and semantic coor-
dination in particular. Accounting for se-
mantic coordination requires (1) a seman-
tics, i.e. an architecture allowing for dy-
namic meanings and meaning updates as
results of dialogue moves, and (2) a prag-
matics, describing the dialogue moves in-
volved in semantic coordination. We illus-
trate the general approach by applying it
to some examples from the literature on
corrective feedback, and provide a fairly
detailed discussion of one example using
TTR (Type Theory with Records) to for-
malize concepts. TTR provides an analy-
sis of linguistic content which is structured
in order to allow modification and similar-
ity metrics, and a framework for describ-
ing dialogue moves and resulting updates
to linguistic resources.
1 Introduction
Here are a few examples of corrective feedback:
A: That?s a nice bear.
B: Yes, it?s a nice panda.
Abe: I?m trying to tip this over, can you tip it
over? Can you tip it over?
Mother: Okay I?ll turn it over for you.
Adam: Mommy, where my plate?
Mother: You mean your saucer?
Naomi: Birdie birdie.
Mother: Not a birdie, a seal.
Naomi: mittens.
Father: gloves.
The first one is made up, the others are quoted
from various sources in (Clark and Wong, 2002)
and (Clark, 2007). In general, corrective feedback
can be regarded as offering an alternative form to
the one that the speaker used. We are interested
in interactions such as these since we believe that
dialogue interaction plays an important role in es-
tablishing a shared language, not only in first (or
second) language acquisition but also in the coor-
dination of meaning in adult language, in histori-
cal language change, and in language evolution.
Two agents do not need to share exactly the
same linguistic resources (grammar, lexicon etc.)
in order to be able to communicate, and an agent?s
linguistic resources can change during the course
of a dialogue when she is confronted with a (for
her) innovative use. For example, research on
alignment shows that agents negotiate domain-
specific microlanguages for the purposes of dis-
cussing the particular domain at hand (Clark and
Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Garrod and Anderson, 1987;
Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Brennan and Clark,
1996; Healey, 1997; Larsson, 2007). We will use
the term semantic coordination to refer to the pro-
cess of interactively coordinating the meanings of
linguistic expressions.
This paper presents work towards a formal the-
ory of corrective feedback, and semantic coordina-
tion in general. It takes a view of natural languages
as toolboxes for constructing domain-specific mi-
crolanguages, and provides an analysis of linguis-
tic content which is structured in order to allow
modification of, and similarity metrics over, mean-
ings.
According to (Cooper and Ranta, 2008), a
?language? such as Swedish or English is to be
1
regarded as a collection of resources (a ?tool-
box?) which can be used to construct local micro-
languages. We take the view that speakers of natu-
ral languages are constantly in the process of cre-
ating new language to meet the needs of novel sit-
uations in which they find themselves.
Accounting for corrective feedback requires (1)
dynamic representations of concepts which can be
modified in various ways, in a process of seman-
tic coordination, and (2) a description of dialogue
strategies involved in semantic coordination.
Accordingly, the research effort which the work
presented here is part of aims towards an account
of semantic coordination in dialogue, consisting of
two parts:
1. semantics: an account of how meanings (and
concepts) can be updated
2. pragmatics: an account of how meanings
(and concepts) are coordinated in dialogue
and how dialogue moves governing coordi-
nation are related to semantic updates
These parts will be presented below, starting
with the pragmatics. At the end of the paper, we
will step back and consider the implications of our
tentative results.
2 The pragmatics of corrective feedback
To get a handle on the pragmatic processes in-
volved in corrective feedback, we will show how
such interactions can be analysed in terms of di-
alogue moves related to semantic updates. This
approach builds on, and extends, the Information
State Update approach to dialogue management
(Traum and Larsson, 2003).
2.1 A taxonomy of corrective feedback
Below, we classify our examples into four kinds of
corrective feedback.
? Example 1: ?In-repair?
? Abe: I?m trying to tip this over, can you
tip it over? Can you tip it over?
? Mother: Okay I?ll turn it over for you.
? Example 2: Clarification request
? Adam: Mommy, where my plate?
? Mother: You mean your saucer?
? Example 3: ?Explicit replace?
? Naomi: Birdie birdie.
? Mother: Not a birdie, a seal.
? Example 4: ?Bare? correction
? Naomi: mittens.
? Father: gloves.
2.2 Dialogue moves for corrective feedback
We will now introduce a representation of dia-
logue moves used in corrective feedback. The gen-
eral format we will use is
? offer-form: TYPE(ARGS)
where ARGS may include one or several of the
following:
? proposed form (P below)
? replaced form (R below)
? sentence frame (F below)
In the representation above, TYPE is one of the
following, corresponding to the kinds of corrective
feedback distinguished above:
? in-repair
? cr
? explicit-replace
? bare
In-repair The in-repair type of corrective feed-
back takes two arguments, the proposed form and
a sentence frame. It is generally preceded by an
utterance containing the sentence frame applied to
the replaced form.
? offer-form:in-repair(P , F )
For illustration, let?s look again at our example,
now with typography indicating PROPOSED
FORM, replaced form and sentence frame:
A(be): Can you tip it over?
M(other): Okay I?ll TURN it over for you.
In relation to A?s utterance, M ?s utterance
contains the same sentence frame F , roughly
?[Mother] it over?. However, they differ in that
whereas M ?s utterance has the proposed word P
= ?TURN?, A?s utterance has R = ?tip?. If we
2
say that sentence frames can be applied to ex-
pressions, resulting in the ? ? in the frame being
replaced with the expression (much as in lambda
reduction), we can say that A?s utterance has the
form ?F (R)? = ?[Mother] it over?(?turn?) =
?[Mother] turn it over? whereas M ?s utterance
has the form ?F (R)?. M ?s utterance corresponds
to the dialogue move:
offer-form:in-repair(?turn?, ?[M] [it] over?)
Note that the syntactic parallelism is not com-
plete; we have ignored the complication that one
utterance contains ?can? and the other ?will? (in
reduced form). The notion of sentence frame used
here is a simplification of a more complex relation
of syntactic and semantic parallelism which needs
to be further explored.
Note also that in addition to providing correc-
tive feedback, M ?s utterance also accepts the con-
tent of the previous contribution. Note that M
might instead have said something like ?No, but
I?ll turn it over for you?.
Clarification requests As in the case of in-
repair offers, offers involving clarification requests
also provide the proposed form together with a
sentence frame linking the move to a previous ut-
terance by the child; presuming that the latter has
the form ?... F (R)?, the offer can be represented
as
offer-form:cr(P , F )
Let?s revisit our example, making explicit the
P , F and R parameters:
A(dam): Mommy, where my plate?
M(other): You mean your SAUCER?
Here, we have F = ?[Adam?s] ?, R = ?plate?
and P = ?SAUCER?. Accordingly, we can de-
scribe M ?s utterance as a dialogue move:
offer-form:cr(?saucer?, ?[A?s] ?)
Typically, CRs have the interpretation ?you
mean/want F (P )??. In addition to offering an al-
ternative form P of expression, a clarification re-
quest also explicitly raises the issue whether the
offer of P is accepted, and is typically followed
by a positive (or negative) answer by the child.
Note that CRs, as well as some other types
of offers, may not be intended as corrections by
the adult, but simply as attempts at understanding
what the child wants to communicate. The cru-
cial point for our purposes here is the effect these
moves have on the addressee, rather than the un-
derlying intention. In general, if I learn something
from someone else, it may not be of great impor-
tance for my learning if they intended for me to
learn it or not.
Explicit replace In contrast to in-repairs and
clarification requests, explicit offers of replace-
ments need not rely on sentence frames to figure
out the replaced form, as it is (as the name
indicates) explicitly mentioned in the offer.
N(aomi): Birdie birdie
M(other): Not a birdie, a SEAL
We represent this kind of dialogue move thus:
offer-form:explicit-replace(P , R)
In the example, the move is offer-
form:explicit-replace(?seal?, ?birdie?). Explicit
replace offers are preceded by an utterance
consisting of or containing the replaced form R,
and typically have the form ?(that?s) not DET R,
(that?s) DET P ? or similar.
Explicit replace offers differ from in-repairs and
clarification requests by clearly signalling that the
replaced form is not appropriate, and by being
clearly intended as providing corrections rather
than (just) figuring out what the child is trying to
communicate.
Bare offers Bare offers are the formally sim-
plest kind of corrective feedback, consisting
simply of the proposed form.
Naomi: Mittens
Father: GLOVES.
The dialogue move representation is
offer-form:bare(P )
In the example, the move is offer-
form:bare(?gloves?). Since neither sentence
frame or replaced form is provided, the replaced
form must be figured out from the conversational
situation as a whole. Just as explicit replace offers,
bare offers are primarily intended as providing
3
corrections.
2.3 Generalising the dialogue move
representation
The different variants for corrective feedback all
do basically the same work; they indicate that
the child needs to modify his or her take on the
meaning of the proposed term, and perhaps also
the replaced term. A possible difference is that
some forms more clearly provide evidence that the
replaced form is not appropriate, whereas others
leave this open. Ignoring this complication for the
moment, we can provide a general form for the
various types of offers of new forms, with the pro-
posed form and the replaced form as arguments:
offer-form(P , R)
Using this representation, the dialogue move
analyses above can be reformulated as, in the order
they appear above:
? offer-form(?turn?, ?tip?)
? offer-form(?saucer?, ?plate?)
? offer-form(?seal?, ?birdie?)
? offer-form(?gloves?, ?mittens?)
In moves which do not explicitly indicate the re-
placed form R, contextual interpretation involves
chart alignment and reasoning about active edges
(represented here by the sentence frame) to locate
an expression R parallel to P in the previous ut-
terance.
2.4 Agents that coordinate resources
As in the information state update approach in
general, dialogue moves are associated with in-
formation state updates. For semantic coordina-
tion, the kind of update is rather different from
the one associated with dialogue moves for coor-
dinating on task-related information, and involves
updating the linguistic resources available to the
agent (grammar, lexicon, semantic interpretation
rules etc.), rather than e.g. the conversational
scoreboard as such. Our view is that agents do
not just have monolithic linguistic resources as is
standardly assumed. Rather they have generic re-
sources which they modify to construct local re-
sources for sublanguages for use in specific sit-
uations. Thus an agent A may associate a lin-
guistic expression c with a particular concept (or
collection of concepts if c is ambiguous) [c]A in
its generic resource. In a particular domain ? c
may be associated with a modified version of [c]A,
[c]A? . In some cases [c]
A
? may contain a smaller
number of concepts than [c]A, representing a de-
crease in ambiguity. Particular concepts in [c]A?
may be a refinement of one in [c]A, that is, the do-
main related concepts have an extension which is
a proper subset of the extension of the correspond-
ing generic concept. This will, however, not be the
case in general. For example, a black hole in the
physics domain is not normally regarded as an ob-
ject described by the generic or standard meaning
of black hole provided by our linguistic resources
outside the physical domain. Similarly a variable
in the domain of logic is a syntactic expression
whereas a variable in experimental psychology is
not and quite possibly the word variable is not
even a noun in generic linguistic resources.
Our idea is that the motor for generating new
such local resources in an agent lies in coordinat-
ing resources with another agent in a particular
communicative situation s. The event s might be
a turn in a dialogue, as in the examples we are dis-
cussing in this paper, or, might, for example, be
a reading event. In a communicative situation s,
an agent A may be confronted with an innovative
utterance c, that is, an utterance which either uses
linguistic expressions not already present in A?s
resources or linguistic expressions known by A
but associated with an interpretation distinct from
that provided by A?s resources. At this point, A
has to accommodate an interpretation for c which
is specific to s, [c]As , and which may be anchored
to the specific objects under discussion in s.
Whereas in a view of semantics inherited from
formal logic there is a pairing between a linguis-
tic expression c and an interpretation c? (or a set of
several interpretations if c is ambiguous), we want
to see c as related to several interpretations: [c]As
for communicative situations s, [c]A? for domains
? (where we imagine that the domains are col-
lected into a complex hierarchy or more and less
general domains) and ultimately a general linguis-
tic resource which is domain independent, [c]A.
We think of the acquisition of a pairing of an ex-
pression c with an interpretation c? as a progres-
sion from an instance where c? is [c]As for some
particular communicative situation s, through po-
tentially a series of increasingly general domains
?where c? is regarded as being one of the interpre-
tations in [c]A? and finally arriving at a state where
4
c? is associated with c as part of a domain indepen-
dent generic resource, that is, c? is in [c]A. There
is no guarantee that any expression-interpretation
pair will survive even beyond the particular com-
municative situation in which A first encountered
it. For example, the kind of ad hoc coinages
described in (Garrod and Anderson, 1987) us-
ing words like leg to describe part of an oddly
shaped maze in the maze game probably do not
survive beyond the particular dialogue in which
they occur. The factors involved in determin-
ing how a particular expression-interpretation pair
progresses we see as inherently stochastic with pa-
rameters including the degree to which A regards
their interlocutor as an expert, how many times the
pairing has been observed in other communicative
situations and with different interlocutors, the util-
ity of the interpretation in different communicative
situations, and positive or negative feedback ob-
tained when using the pairing in a communicative
situation. For example, an agent may only allow a
pairing to progress when it has been observed in at
least n different communicative situations at least
m of which were with an interlocutor considered
to be an expert, and so on. We do not yet have a
precise proposal for a theory of these stochastic as-
pects but rather are seeking to lay the groundwork
of a semantic treatment on which such a theory
could be built.
3 The semantics of corrective feedback
3.1 Representing concepts using TTR
We shall make use of type theory with records
(TTR) as characterized in Cooper (2005; 2008)
and elsewhere. The advantage of TTR is that it
integrates logical techniques such as binding and
the lambda-calculus into feature-structure like
objects called record types. Thus we get more
structure than in a traditional formal semantics
and more logic than is available in traditional
unification-based systems. The feature structure
like properties are important for developing
similarity metrics on meanings and for the
straightforward definition of meanings modifi-
cations involving refinement and generalization.
The logical aspects are important for relating
our semantics to the model and proof theoretic
tradition associated with compositional semantics.
Below is an example of a record type:
[
REF : Ind
SIZE : size(REF, MuchBiggerThanMe)
SHAPE : shape(REF, BearShape)
]
A record of this type has to have fields with
the same labels as those in the type. (It may also
include additional fields not required by the type.)
In place of the types which occur to the right of
?:? in the record type, the record must contain an
object of that type. Here is an example of a record
of the above type:
?
?
?
REF = obj123
SIZE = sizesensorreading85
SHAPE = shapesensorreading62
COLOUR = coloursensorreadning78
?
?
?
Thus, for example, what occurs to the right of
the ?=? in the REF field of the record is an object
of type Ind, that is, an individual. Types which
are constructed with predicates like size and shape
are sometimes referred to as ?types of proof?. The
idea is that something of this type would be a proof
that a given individual (the first argument) has a
certain size or shape (the second argument). One
can have different ideas of what kind of objects
count as proofs. Here we are assuming that the
proof-objects are readings from sensors. This is a
second way (in addition to the progression of lo-
cal resources towards general resources) that our
theory interfaces with a statistical non-categorical
world. We imagine that the mapping from sensor
readings to types involves sampling of analogue
data in a way that is not unsimilar to the digiti-
zation process involved, for example, in speech
recognition. Again we have nothing detailed to
say about this at the moment, although we regard
it as an important part of our theory that it is able
to make a connection between the realm of feature
vectors and the realm of model-theoretic seman-
tics.
Types constructed with predicates may also be
dependent. This is represented by the fact that ar-
guments to the predicate may be represented by
labels used on the left of the ?:? elsewhere in the
record type. This means, for example, that in con-
sidering whether a record is of the record type, you
will need to find a proof that the object which is in
the REF-field of the record has the size represented
by MuchBiggerThanMe. That is, this type depends
on the value for the REF-field.
Some of our types will contain manifest fields
(Coquand et al, 2004) like the REF-field in the
following type:
5
[
REF=obj123 : Ind
SIZE : size(REF, MuchBiggerThanMe)
SHAPE : shape(REF, BearShape)
]
[
REF=obj123:Ind
]
is a convenient notation for
[
REF : Indobj123
]
where Indobj123 is a singleton
type. If a : T , then Ta is a singleton type and
b : Ta (i.e. b is of type Ta) iff b = a. Manifest
fields allow us to progressively specify what val-
ues are required for the fields in a type.
An important notion in this kind of type theory
is that of subtype. For example,
[
REF : Ind
SIZE : size(REF, MuchBiggerThanMe)
]
is a subtype of
[
REF : Ind
]
as is also
[
REF=obj123 : Ind
]
The subtype relation corresponds to that of sub-
sumption in typed feature structures. This gives us
the ability to create type hierarchies corresponding
to ontologies (in the sense, for example, of OWL).
Such ontologies (coded in terms of record types)
play an important role in our notion of resources
available to an agent. In fact, modelling concepts
in terms of record types commits us to a view of
concepts which is very closely related to work on
ontologies. But our view of the creation of lo-
cal situation specific and domain related resources
in addition to generic resources means that agents
have access not to a single generic ontology but
also situation specific and domain related ontolo-
gies. And, perhaps most important of all, the pro-
cess of semantic coordination with an interlocutor
can involve local ad hoc adjustment to an ontol-
ogy. This plays an important role in characteriz-
ing the options open to an agent when confronted
with an innovative utterance. We attempt to illus-
trate this below by working in more detail through
a specific example.
3.2 ?Panda? as an example of innovative use
We provide an analysis ofB?s utterance in our ini-
tial example as a move of offering ?panda? as an
alternative for ?bear?, and as potentially triggering
an update onA?s concepts for ?bear? and ?panda?.
A: That?s a nice bear
B: Yes, it?s a nice panda
The dialogue move analysis of this example is
offer-form:in-repair(?panda?, ?[it] is a nice ?),
or in the generalised format offer-form(?panda?,
?bear?).
We assume that, before B?s utterance, A has
a single concept of ?bear? in a domain called
?zoo?, that is, a unique member of the collection
[bear]Azoo. We represent it in Figure 1. A?s take on
the communicative situation where B?s utterance
takes place (that is,A?s dialogue information state,
much simplified for expository reasons) is shown
in Figure 2. This is intended to describe a situation
at a zoo, where a bear-shaped object much bigger
than A is in focus (FOO here stands for ?Focused
Object?).
What happens after B?s utterance? First, we as-
sume that B correctly understands A?s utterance
as offering ?panda? as an alternative for ?bear?.
Now, assuming that B has not observed the word
?panda? before,A needs to create a panda-concept
[panda]As , local to the communicative situation s
resulting from B?s utterance. Since ?panda? has
been aligned with ?bear?, it is natural to base
the new panda concept on the bear concept, as-
sociated with the domain. Here A is confronted
with a fundamental choice. Should a condition
?panda(REF)? be added to the concept in addition
to the condition ?bear(REF)? making the panda
concept be a subtype of the bear concept or should
the panda condition replace the bear condition,
making panda and bear sisters in the ontology?
There is not enough evidence in this simple ex-
change to determine this.1 We will choose to re-
place the bear condition with the panda condition.
But there is more that must happen.
A has observed that the use of ?panda? in s
refers to the focused object obj123. Following
the principle of contrast (Clark and Wong, 2002)
which states that ?(s)peakers take every difference
in form to mark a difference in meaning?, B takes
?panda? to have a different meaning than ?bear?
in some respect other than that it is a panda as
opposed to a bear, and looks for something about
obj123 which might distinguish it from previously
observed bears. For example, the child might de-
cide that it is the colour (black and white) that
1And indeed many people can reach adulthood, the
present authors included, without being sure whether pandas
are a kind of bear or not.

Figure 2: A?s take on s
distinguishes it from previously observed bears
(which have all been brown)2. A now creates a
situated interpretation [panda]As of ?panda?, based
on [bear]Azoo, as shown in Figure 3.
But now if colour is being used to distin-
guish between bears and pandas in situation s, A
should create a refined bear concept for s, namely
Figure 4 reflecting the hypothesis that bears are
brown. If A is optimistic, possibly influenced
by the degree of expertise which A assigns to B
(?Mummy knows about zoos?), A might imme-
diately associate the concept in Figure 4 with the
zoo domain, that is, make it be a new value for
[bear]Azoo and similarly for a dereferenced version
of Figure 3, that is a version in which the manifest
field is replaced by
[

]
. Finally, A?s new
take on s is shown in Figure 5; A has accepted that
the focused object is a panda.
4 Conclusion
We have sketched an account of how concepts
can be updated as a result of language use in
interaction. Such processes enable coordination
of domain-specific microlanguages, involving a
domain-specific grammar and lexicon, an ontol-
ogy, and a mapping between lexicon and ontology.
There are many mechanisms for semantic coor-
dination, some of which can be described as cor-
rective feedback: clarification requests, explicit
corrections, meaning accommodation (observing
instances of language use and silently adapting to
successful instances) and explicit negotiation. Se-
mantic coordination, in turn, is a kind of language
coordination (other kinds include e.g. phonetic co-
2This account relies on A having a memory of previously
observed instances of a concept, in addition to the concept it-
self (which in the case of ?bear? does not contain information
about colour).
ordination). Finally, language coordination coex-
ists with information coordination, the exchang-
ing and sharing of information (agreeing on rele-
vant information and future action; maintaining a
shared view on current topics of discussion, rele-
vant questions etc.). Arguably, the main point of
language coordination is to enable information co-
ordination.
Semantic coordination happens in dialogue; it
is part of language coordination; and it is a pre-
requisite for information coordination. If we say
that a linguistic expression c has meaning only
if it is possible to exchange information using c,
then semantic coordination is essential to mean-
ing. A linguistic expression c has meaning in a
language community when the community mem-
bers are sufficiently coordinated with respect to
the meaning of c to allow them to use c to ex-
change information. In other words: meaning
emerges from a process of semantic coordination
in dialogue.
