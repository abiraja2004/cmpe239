Abstract
Semantic role classification accuracy for most
languages other than English is constrained by
the small amount of annotated data. In this pa-
per, we demonstrate how the frame-to-frame
relations described in the FrameNet ontology
can be used to improve the performance of
a FrameNet-based semantic role classifier for
Swedish, a low-resource language. In order
to make use of the FrameNet relations, we
cast the semantic role classification task as
a non-atomic label prediction task. The ex-
periments show that the cross-frame general-
ization methods lead to a 27% reduction in
the number of errors made by the classifier.
For previously unseen frames, the reduction is
even more significant: 50%.
1 Introduction
The FrameNet lexical database and annotated cor-
pora, based on the theory of semantic frames (Fill-
more et al, 2003), have allowed the implementa-
tion of automatic systems to extract semantic roles
(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Johansson and Nugues,
2007; Ma`rquez et al, 2008; Das et al, 2010).
Since the original FrameNet is developed for the
English language, most research on semantic role
extraction has focused exclusively on English. How-
ever, the English FrameNet has inspired similar ef-
forts for other languages. For instance, the ongo-
ing development of a Swedish FrameNet (Borin et
al., 2010) allows us to investigate the feasibility
of using this resource in constructing an automatic
role-semantic analyzer for Swedish. However, due
to the fact that the Swedish FrameNet annotation
process is in a fairly early stage, not much anno-
tated material is available, and this limits the perfor-
mance attainable by automatic classifiers trained on
these data. In particular, the scarce amount of data
makes it very hard for the machine learning meth-
ods to discern general linguistic facts concerning the
syntactic?semantic linking patterns, such as the rela-
tion between the voice of a verb, the syntactic func-
tions of its arguments, and the semantic roles of the
arguments (Dowty, 1991).
In this paper, we show that the inter-frame rela-
tions described in the FrameNet ontology allow us
to generalize across frames. This allows the clas-
sifier to learn general linguistic facts, and it also
leads to more efficient use of the annotated data.
To allow this kind of generalization, we formulate
the semantic role selection problem as a classifica-
tion task with non-atomic labels. This cross-frame
generalization method reduces the number of errors
made by the classifier by 27%, improving the accu-
racy from 54.4 to 66.5. When evaluating on frames
for which the classifier has not been trained, the ac-
curacy improves from 7.2 (random performance) to
53.4, a 50% error reduction.
2 The Swedish FrameNet
The Swedish FrameNet, SweFN, is a lexical re-
source under development (Friberg Heppin and
Toporowska Gronostaj, 2012), based on the English
version of FrameNet constructed by the Berkeley re-
search group (Baker et al, 1998). It is found on the
SweFN website1, and is available as a free resource.
The SweFN frames and frame names correspond
to the English ones, with some exceptions, as do
the selection of frame elements including defini-
tions and internal relations. The meta-information
about the frames, such as semantic relations be-
tween frames, is also transferred from the Berkley
FrameNet. Compared to the Berkeley FrameNet,
SweFN is expanded with information about the do-
main of the frames, at present: general language, the
medical and the art domain.

At the time of writing this paper, SweFN cov-
ered 519 frames with around 18,000 lexical units.
The lexical units are gathered from SALDO, a free
Swedish electronic association lexicon (Borin and
Forsberg, 2009). A lexical unit from SALDO can-
not populate more than one frame. At present there
are 31 frames in SweFNwhich do not match a frame
in the Berkeley FrameNet. Of these, there are eight
completely new frames while the others have been
modified in some way.
Crucially for the work presented in this paper,
each frame is exemplified with at least one sentence.
The number of sentences is currently 2,974. The
most well-annotated frames are EXPERIENCER OBJ
with 38 sentences, CAUSE MOTION with 21, and
CAUSE HARM with 19. These sentences form the
training material used in the following sections.
3 System Implementation
In this section, we describe the implementation of
our semantic role labeling system. In order to be
useful on its own, such a system needs to solve sev-
eral tasks: (1) identification of predicate words; (2)
assignment of frames to predicate words; (3) iden-
tification of role fillers; (4) assignment of semantic
role labels to role fillers. In this paper, we focus ex-
clusively on the semantic role classification task.
3.1 Baseline: A Classifier for Swedish
Semantic Roles
Following most previous implementations, we used
a syntactic parse tree as the basis of the semantic
role extraction; we assumed that every semantic role
span coincides with the projection of a subtree in
the syntactic tree. The tasks of segmentation and
labeling then reduce to a classification problem on
syntactic tree nodes. Each sentence was parsed by
the LTH dependency parser (Johansson and Nugues,
2008a), which we trained on a Swedish treebank
(Nilsson et al, 2005). Figure 1 shows a sentence an-
notated with a dependency tree and semantic roles.
The semantic role labeling classifier was imple-
mented as a linear multiclass classifier with a flexi-
ble output space depending on the frame of the given
predicate; we trained this classifier using an online
learning algorithm (Crammer et al, 2006). In ad-
dition, we imposed a uniqueness constraint on the
labels output by the classifier, so that every role may
appear only once for a given predicate.
We considered a large number of features for the
classifier (Table 1). Most of these are commonly
used features taken from the standard literature on
semantic role labeling. We then applied a standard
greedy forward feature selection procedure to deter-
mine which of them to use. The features contain-
ing SALDO ID refer to the entry identifiers in the
SALDO lexicon. Note that the POS tags have coarse
and fine variants, such as VERB and VERB-FINITE-
PRESENT-ACTIVE respectively, and we used both of
them.
Semantic role classifiers rely heavily on lexical
features (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b), and this
may lead to brittleness; in order to increase robust-
ness, we added features based on hierarchical clus-
ters constructed using the Brown algorithm (Brown
et al, 1992). The Brown algorithm clusters word
into hierarchies represented as bit strings. Based on
tuning on a development set, we found that it was
best not to use the full bit string, but only a prefix if
the string was longer than 12 bits.

3.2 A Classifier Using Non-atomic Semantic
Role Labels
The classifier described above is a quite typical ex-
ample of how semantic role classifiers are normally
implemented: each frame is independent of all other
frames. However, in our case, when the amount of
training data is quite small, the limitations of this
standard approach become apparent:
? Since there are many frames, the amount of
training data for each frame is very limited.

Figure 1: A sentence with dependency syntax (above) and semantic role structure (below).
? Basic linguistic facts, such as which roles are
likely to appear in subject position, have to be
relearned for each frame.
To remedy these problems, we developed a classi-
fier using non-atomic labels: instead of just a simple
label INGESTION:INGESTOR, the classifier can pre-
dict several labels, using some sort of decomposition
into meaningful parts. In ?3.3, we will describe sev-
eral such decompositions.
As described above, our baseline classifier is a
standard linear classifier. Assume that the frame F
defines a set of semantic roles r1, . . . , rn, then the
classifier predicts a semantic role r? for a given ar-
gument a using this model:
r? = argmax
r?F
w ? ?(a, r)
Here ? is a feature function describing features of
the argument a taking the semantic role r, and w is a
weight vector produced by some training algorithm.
This classifier model can easily be generalized to
the non-atomic case. We then assume that each role
r can be decomposed using a decomposition func-
tion D, which returns a set of labels. We now apply
the feature function to each sub-label l instead of the
main label r.
r? = argmax
r?F
?
l?D(r)
w ? ?(a, l)
Non-atomic classification has been described in a
number of publications. It is fairly common in text
categorization, where hierarchical classification is
probably the most common type. One of the most
similar to ours is the action classifier by Roth and
Tu (2009), which handled a large label set by de-
composing the labels into meaningful parts.
3.3 Generalization Methods
We investigated several ways of analyzing the labels,
and most of them were based on the properties of
the frames, defined in the FrameNet ontology. The
Swedish FrameNet currently does not define such
properties, but since the frames and frame elements
are for the most part based on their English coun-
terparts, we used the English ontology. In case of
mismatch, we just left the label in its original state.
The first method we tried was based on frame-to-
frame relations. We used the following relations:
INHERITANCE: specific to general, e.g. COMMU-
NICATION NOISE to COMMUNICATION.
SUBFRAME: from component to complex, e.g.
SETTING OUT to TRAVEL.
CAUSATIVE-OF: causative to inchoative,
e.g. CAUSE TEMPERATURE CHANGE to
INCH. CHANGE OF TEMP..
INCHOATIVE-OF: inchoative to stative, e.g.
INCH. CHANGE OF TEMP. to TEMPERATURE.
USING: child to parent, e.g. COMMUNICA-
TION NOISE to MAKE NOISE.
PERSPECTIVE-ON: perspectivized to neutral, e.g.
RIDE VEHICLE to USE VEHICLE.
To analyze a label in terms of frame-to-frame
relations, we applied the transitive closure of
each relation and returned the resulting set. For
instance, when applying the Inheritance rela-
tion to the INGESTION:INGESTOR label, we get
the following set: { INGESTION:INGESTOR,
INGEST SUBSTANCE:INGESTOR, MANIPU-
LATION:AGENT, INTENT. AFFECT:AGENT,
INTENT. ACT:AGENT, TRANS. ACTION:AGENT }.
The second method was based on the semantic
type of the semantic role. For instance, the INGES-
TION:INGESTOR role needs to be filled by an en-
tity of the semantic type SENTIENT. The decom-
position of this role then simply becomes { INGES-
TION:INGESTOR, SENTIENT }.
The third method was based on the simple no-
tion label generalization: if two semantic roles
97
in two different frames have the same name,
then we use the same label. For instance,
we change the INGESTION:INGESTOR and IN-
GEST SUBSTANCE:INGESTOR to INGESTOR. We
normalized the spelling, punctuation, and capitaliza-
tion of the labels before generalizing.
4 Experiments
We evaluated the classifier on the example sentences
in the Swedish FrameNet. The frame and the ar-
gument were given to the classifier, which then had
to predict the semantic role. We evaluated in two
different ways: In-frame evaluation, where a 5-fold
cross-validation was carried out over the set of sen-
tences, and Out-frame evaluation, where the cross-
validation was done over the set of frames. The out-
frame setting simulates the situation where a new
frame has been defined, but no training data have
been annotated. Without any sort of cross-frame
generalization, the classification in the out-frame
setting becomes a random baseline.
Table 2 shows the results of using the frame-to-
frame relations for analyzing the semantic role la-
bels. We see that decomposition based on Inheri-
tance is by far the most effective of these, although
the highest performance is obtained when combin-
ing all types of relation-based decompositions.

Table 2: Classification results with generalization based
on frame-to-frame relations.
The effect of analyzing labels in terms of semantic
type is similar. The in-frame performance is higher
than that of relation-based decomposition, while the
out-frame performance is a bit lower. The two gen-
eralization methods seem to complement each other,
since we get a higher performance by combining
them. Table 3 shows the results.

Finally, Table 4 shows the effect of using label
generalization. This is by far the most effective
method. However, we get even higher performance
by combining it with the other two methods.

5 Discussion
When developing NLP systems for a low-resource
language, it is crucial to make effective use of the
available data. In the case of FrameNet semantic
role classification, one way to improve the use of the
data is to generalize the roles across the frames. This
also makes sense from a theoretical point of view,
since predicting multiple labels allows the machine
learner to learn general facts as well as specifics.
This work builds on previous work in multi-label
classification. For the task of FrameNet semantic
role classification, the work most closely related to
ours is that by Matsubayashi et al (2009), which de-
fined a classifier making use of role groups; the ef-
fect of the role groups turns out to be similar to our
non-atomic classification approach.
Our experiments showed very significant error re-
ductions. This was especially notable in the case of
out-frame evaluation, which is to be expected since
the baseline in this case was a random selection. The
best classifier used all three types of label decom-
position, and achieved a 26% in-frame and a 50%
out-frame error reduction.
